[00:52.320 --> 00:57.200]  ready to go there are huge explosions at military compounds and
[00:57.200 --> 01:03.760]  universities inside Syria as Western back to Al Qaeda prepares to try to
[01:03.760 --> 01:09.080]  overthrow the entire government and put a new jihadi command base in place
[01:09.080 --> 01:14.220]  which will then be used as the excuse take our liberties here at home and the
[01:14.220 --> 01:22.360]  public is so addled with worrying about the striking referees that they'll be
[01:22.360 --> 01:26.600]  happy to have the TSA set up checkpoints and grow up their family and take them
[01:26.600 --> 01:33.600]  to FEMA camps as long as the referees come off of strike Spain recoils as
[01:33.600 --> 01:38.040]  it's hungry forage for in trash bins for the next meal they're going the
[01:38.040 --> 01:42.920]  Argentina route that we saw in 2000 this is where the rest of Europe's going
[01:42.920 --> 01:45.960]  and it's where we're going I've been telling you that for a decade and
[01:45.960 --> 01:51.440]  intense sleep since 2008 because it's a plan how do I know the future it's a
[01:51.440 --> 01:56.840]  plan the only way we don't have a big war with Iran is to back the global
[01:56.840 --> 02:00.280]  of staff the only way we don't have this global depression is to expose that
[02:00.280 --> 02:04.600]  they're behind it and then if we're successful in stopping a strike on Iran
[02:04.600 --> 02:09.280]  we get blamed and they say oh you said there'd be a strike on Iran or if we're
[02:09.280 --> 02:14.000]  successful backing off a total implosion in the economy they say oh you
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.480]  said we have a bad economy when we already have a terrible economy this is
[02:17.480 --> 02:22.240]  the mind games the system plays we're in a depression to a great extent but it
[02:22.240 --> 02:26.880]  can certainly get a hell of a lot deeper oh there's going to be a war in
[02:26.880 --> 02:31.160]  Libya mr. fearmonger than there is a war in Libya oh big deal that's not a war

[03:16.640 --> 03:20.360]  so they got kids wearing RFID tags at public schools everywhere and people
[03:20.360 --> 03:24.320]  thumb scanning and face scanning to buy and sell so we got the biggest prison
[03:24.320 --> 03:29.520]  population in the world so we got the highest cancer rates in the world so
[03:29.520 --> 03:33.560]  there's more lawsuits being filed as the EPA has been caught pumping toxic gas
[03:33.560 --> 03:38.760]  into hospitals oh yeah that's coming up today big deal so the government
[03:38.760 --> 03:42.800]  apologized for shooting little kids up with syphilis so they nerve gas some of
[03:42.800 --> 03:46.840]  our troops and killed thousands of them big deal so the troops are dying of
[03:46.840 --> 03:51.680]  cancer at record numbers from DU and they've got 14 15-fold increases in
[03:51.680 --> 03:55.840]  cancer and Iraqi children from DU and a four to five-fold increase in our
[03:55.840 --> 04:00.560]  troops what's the big deal what's the big deal cities and counties and states
[04:00.560 --> 04:03.800]  are going bankrupt everywhere corporations are going bankrupt everywhere

[04:08.200 --> 04:13.400]  what's the big deal so unemployment's really 25% nationwide according to John
[04:13.400 --> 04:18.200]  Williams shadow stats what's the big deal everything's okay you're not supposed
[04:18.200 --> 04:21.600]  to wake up and say no to this you're supposed to stay in your normalcy bias
[04:21.600 --> 04:25.440]  you're supposed to go along with all of this you're supposed to put up with it
[04:25.440 --> 04:31.040]  you're not supposed to have a problem with any of this you're supposed to love
[04:31.040 --> 04:35.120]  it so what there's hundreds and hundreds of studies showing GMO
[04:35.120 --> 04:39.000]  sterilizes all the rats by three generations that eat it and cause of
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.200]  organ failure and premature death and then we see those exact type trends
[04:43.200 --> 04:49.200]  forming in humans what's the big deal come on man's government's great public

[06:03.680 --> 06:08.160]  farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but
[06:08.160 --> 06:11.720]  to healthy home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yoghurt
[06:11.720 --> 06:15.480]  and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and
[06:15.480 --> 06:19.000]  healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of
[06:19.000 --> 06:22.160]  these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with
[06:22.160 --> 06:25.320]  archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across
[06:25.320 --> 06:29.640]  the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat
[06:29.640 --> 06:33.960]  fermented porches Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple
[06:33.960 --> 06:37.480]  for healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant Americans can now

[08:12.880 --> 08:17.400]  more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages
[08:17.400 --> 08:23.080]  you're a bug mr. Wordsworth a crawling insect ugly misformed little creature
[08:23.080 --> 08:30.320]  who has no purpose here no meaning I am a human being words mr. Wordsworth they
[08:30.320 --> 08:36.360]  have no substance and no dimension like air like a wind I don't care I tell you
[08:36.360 --> 08:43.000]  I don't care I'm a human being I exist if I speak one for a lot that's not
[08:43.000 --> 09:03.600]  liars even after I'm showered in my great the illusions mr. Wordsworth the illusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength when you have no strength at all you have nothing but spindly limbs of a dream and the strength has no use for your crime
[09:03.600 --> 09:13.680]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[09:13.680 --> 09:25.840]  energize I'm rolling up my sleeves right now I am ready to go it is Wednesday the
[09:25.840 --> 09:34.000]  26th day of September 2012 and I have come here to rampage in a full frontal
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.040]  assault on the globalist facade the crumbling facade of globalist lies and
[09:40.040 --> 09:46.360]  fraud prepare yourselves ladies and gentlemen for a journey into the depths
[09:46.360 --> 09:54.440]  of truth only by facing the whole truth and nothing but the truth can we grip
[09:54.440 --> 10:00.040]  liberty and freedom and enlightenment and empowerment in our time in our age
[10:00.040 --> 10:08.040]  and for our progeny we stand at the fulcrum we stand at the interchange the
[10:08.040 --> 10:17.160]  crossroads the jump point to the future it is being governed now and we are
[10:17.160 --> 10:22.760]  wrestling against armies of control freaks the scientific technology that
[10:22.760 --> 10:30.920]  craves control of humanity in our destiny that craves control of reality but
[10:30.920 --> 10:36.520]  humanity is awakening to this great threat and the sleeping giant that is
[10:36.520 --> 10:43.480]  our true intellect is beginning to awaken is beginning to stir and like a
[10:43.480 --> 10:50.640]  giant engine the wheels for a great period dormant are beginning to move
[10:50.640 --> 11:00.280]  and once they begin to turn nothing on earth can stop them only the good Lord
[11:00.280 --> 11:04.760]  above the creator of the firmament can stop it and why would God stop it
[11:04.760 --> 11:11.240]  because truth and justice and enlightenment and creativity and life and
[11:11.240 --> 11:19.560]  empowerment flows out of the Creator we are live ladies and gentlemen on this
[11:19.560 --> 11:24.320]  Wednesday transmission and let me tell you about who's coming up dr. Paul Craig
[11:24.320 --> 11:28.600]  Roberts former head of the Treasury will be joining us as well even forms his
[11:28.600 --> 11:32.040]  list seems one of the top 10 living economists to break down what QE
[11:32.040 --> 11:36.560]  unlimited is going to do to the world economy and what he sees happening with
[11:36.560 --> 11:45.320]  war drums then we're going to have David snare and David snare heads up the
[11:45.320 --> 11:50.240]  group that has filed suit the American Tradition Institute Environmental Law
[11:50.240 --> 11:55.600]  Center they caught in North Carolina we knew about this months ago but couldn't
[11:55.600 --> 12:01.720]  talk about it because David night's involved as well helping them one of our
[12:01.720 --> 12:08.040]  reporters of our field reporters discovering how they were pumping toxic
[12:08.040 --> 12:12.560]  gas into a hospital you cannot make this up it's part of the course these are
[12:12.560 --> 12:18.920]  eugenicists a us code title 50 chapter 32 subsection 1,520 a paragraph b
[12:18.920 --> 12:23.040]  states that it's illegal to do testing on the American people without their
[12:23.040 --> 12:28.360]  consent unless it's for research says absolutely forbidden unless it's for
[12:28.360 --> 12:33.040]  research purposes that's why the Kim trailing all of its called research
[12:33.040 --> 12:37.280]  maybe they'll start robbing banks and call it researcher you know running
[12:37.280 --> 12:39.760]  children down in the middle of the street when they get off the school bus
[12:39.760 --> 12:44.280]  and call it research I mean that's the games these people play that's why the
[12:44.280 --> 12:49.320]  eugenicists that created Hitler in this country the Rockefeller Foundation others
[12:49.320 --> 12:52.800]  look it up it's it's a fact it's not debatable there's New York Times number
[12:52.800 --> 12:55.920]  one best-sellers breaking it down from the Nuremberg trials the Kaiser
[12:55.920 --> 12:59.400]  Vilhelm Institute the Rockefeller eugenics Institute the Cold Springs
[12:59.400 --> 13:05.880]  Harbor Institute they hired over 28,000 top Nazis congressional reports show to
[13:05.880 --> 13:11.160]  run not just NASA as you know but every other agency and to come over here and
[13:11.160 --> 13:15.960]  start nerve-gassing and chemical weaponing and radiating our troops and
[13:15.960 --> 13:21.360]  their wives and their children by the tens of thousands they were coming home
[13:21.360 --> 13:26.080]  baby the Nazis didn't come over here the Nazis came from here and went over
[13:26.080 --> 13:30.160]  there and they are called liberals today they're not real liberals that's
[13:30.160 --> 13:36.160]  their cloaking device that's their cloaking device that's their camouflage
[13:36.160 --> 13:40.160]  these are eugenicists and they're savage and they mean business and they want
[13:40.160 --> 13:45.080]  control of society their control freaks and they crave it just like you and I
[13:45.080 --> 13:50.440]  crave liberty and crave freedom and we like seeing people free and we like
[13:50.440 --> 13:55.080]  seeing people do well we like seeing success and we're not threatened by it
[13:55.080 --> 14:01.600]  their type is threatened by it and wants to run everything whereas those of us
[14:01.600 --> 14:06.000]  that are strong or ashamed when we dominate people that are weaker even
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.760]  when the weak are in the wrong we don't want to exercise our power there's a
[14:10.760 --> 14:16.800]  governor built into us the evil weak crave the power because they are weak
[14:16.800 --> 14:24.040]  and they are the age-old enemy of our species and they must be overcome before
[14:24.040 --> 14:29.040]  humans can go to the next level and they will be overcome they will be
[14:29.040 --> 14:33.280]  defeated pretty wound up today because what happens is I read this news last
[14:33.280 --> 14:36.880]  night this morning I sit near for an hour before pouring over it and it gets
[14:36.880 --> 14:42.520]  me wound up but then it doesn't have that first look or that second look or
[14:42.520 --> 14:45.960]  that third look feeling of a new piece of news to me that's why I tend to never
[14:45.960 --> 14:50.640]  even cover 10% of it it's all up at info wars.com and prison planet.com and I
[14:50.640 --> 14:56.640]  tend to settle back just into the basic thought processes of our enemies so that
[14:56.640 --> 15:01.560]  you may understand their twisted dark satanic logic because once you
[15:01.560 --> 15:07.800]  understand the twisted logic of these twisted brainiacs then you can understand
[15:07.800 --> 15:13.280]  their entire course before even going out and reading their writings you will
[15:13.280 --> 15:19.040]  know their thoughts before you confirm it by their own roadmaps and battle
[15:19.040 --> 15:26.200]  plans that they're so arrogant they leave all around us to see but it's more
[15:26.200 --> 15:30.840]  than that it is a metaphysical rule that the enemy must tell you what it's
[15:30.840 --> 15:35.240]  going to do before it does it the vampire must trick you into inviting it
[15:35.240 --> 15:44.760]  into your home and these are spiritual vampires they are your mortal enemy and
[15:44.760 --> 15:50.880]  the fact that you won't recognize it that we have malevolent twisted demonic
[15:50.880 --> 15:58.520]  animated creatures walking the face of this earth seeking power roaring to see
[15:58.520 --> 16:03.920]  who they can devour going about roaring seeing who they can devour who will
[16:03.920 --> 16:09.200]  cower to them who will fall in fear I used to watch movies as a child and
[16:09.200 --> 16:12.360]  think when the killer came in with a knife or something why everybody fall
[16:12.360 --> 16:16.200]  down in fear and shake I thought that wasn't real I thought that that was only
[16:16.200 --> 16:20.640]  in movies until I studied real history and saw that actually a lot of people
[16:20.640 --> 16:26.360]  act like that in reality that's why so many people hear this show or see this
[16:26.360 --> 16:34.080]  show at prison planet dot TV and they think I'm trying to scare them no
[16:34.080 --> 16:39.360]  somebody bust in here with a knife or a gun I defend myself not because I'm
[16:39.360 --> 16:44.720]  Billy bad but but because I have a survival instinct and so I have a
[16:44.720 --> 16:53.840]  defensive killer instinct that will trump evil any day evil cannot keep
[16:53.840 --> 16:59.520]  coming if somebody good stands in its way and is committed you may be struck
[16:59.520 --> 17:07.040]  down but in that act it activates at a subatomic level other resistors and
[17:07.040 --> 17:12.160]  that's what we have to do we have to beat the drum to call out the humans
[17:12.160 --> 17:18.080]  who are ready to resist the tyrants we have to commit to the ancient and holy
[17:18.080 --> 17:25.760]  right of resistance to tyrants it is the only way to truly fulfill yourself and
[17:25.760 --> 17:30.400]  yes my friends to commune with the creator of the universe and I'm trying
[17:30.400 --> 17:33.600]  not to preach here but I just can't help it ladies and gentlemen because that's
[17:33.600 --> 17:37.080]  what it's really all about and you're not going to find it 95% of these
[17:37.080 --> 17:41.040]  churches I'm gonna stop right there and let you know what's coming up today I
[17:41.040 --> 17:48.400]  told you about the guest huge amounts of incredible news massive explosions and
[17:48.400 --> 17:52.640]  Damascus strike top Syrian army building probably not even a bombing
[17:52.640 --> 17:58.600]  probably 2,000 pound bomb looking at it how do I know I've studied warfare how
[17:58.600 --> 18:03.560]  did I know that the reactor cores had blown up at Fukushima I interviewed top
[18:03.560 --> 18:09.240]  radiation experts nuclear plant designers nuclear physicist I blew up the
[18:09.240 --> 18:13.120]  video of reactor 3 blowing up I looked up the fact they were storing the fuel
[18:13.120 --> 18:17.520]  rods on top I looked at the fuel rod storage containers and was able to say
[18:17.520 --> 18:23.680]  those are fuel rod containers blown two miles by measuring the video off the
[18:23.680 --> 18:27.840]  height of the communication towers around the facility and then of course
[18:27.840 --> 18:31.520]  it came out a year later in the New York Times that they were storing the rods
[18:31.520 --> 18:37.200]  on top of buildings they've been blown two miles total precision not hard to
[18:37.200 --> 18:44.160]  engage in not hard to engage in I can look at the the bombing a few months
[18:44.160 --> 18:47.920]  ago one of the military training facilities and this new one and tell

[24:14.720 --> 24:18.760]  ship we took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody
[24:18.760 --> 24:22.760]  British and a town in New Orleans we fired our guns and the British kept
[24:22.760 --> 24:27.520]  becoming there wasn't as many as there was a while ago we fired once more and
[24:27.520 --> 24:33.160]  they began to run it on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[24:33.160 --> 24:37.720]  we looked down a river and we see the British come and they must have been a
[24:37.720 --> 24:41.520]  hundred of beating on the drums they stepped so high and they made the
[24:41.520 --> 24:45.840]  bugles ring we stood beside our cotton bales didn't say a thing we fired our
[24:45.840 --> 24:50.200]  guns and a British kept becoming there wasn't as many as there was a while ago

[25:02.720 --> 25:07.000]  we looked them in the eye that's a good part about the New World Order being all over the
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.720]  place having their operatives taking over every facet of society raising taxes
[25:11.720 --> 25:17.520]  regulations trying to rob us every way they can we're completely surrounded so
[25:17.520 --> 25:21.720]  we got plenty of targets in the info war and the oppression of the system is
[25:21.720 --> 25:27.160]  really starting to wake people up in a big big way coming up after our two
[25:27.160 --> 25:31.080]  guests join us in the next hour I'm going to be getting into the tipping
[25:31.080 --> 25:35.960]  point and other historical tipping points an example of how easy it is to
[25:35.960 --> 25:41.440]  actually defeat the globalist if we just wake up to their tyranny and as I
[25:41.440 --> 25:48.600]  said I will also get into you know you are a conspiracy theorist if coming up
[25:48.600 --> 25:52.240]  in the next segment and then 30 examples of why America is no longer a free
[25:52.240 --> 25:58.880]  country both are up at prisonplanet.com and info wars.com right now let me get
[25:58.880 --> 26:06.400]  into the economy first here here is CNBC Spain recoils as its hungry forage
[26:06.400 --> 26:12.040]  trash bins for the next meal they have upwards in some cities a 50% unemployment
[26:12.040 --> 26:18.000]  it's over 30% in the general country and the debt that they've signed on to over
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.760]  90% of it the same in every other country whether it's Iceland or Greece or
[26:21.760 --> 26:28.840]  Ireland or Portugal is derivatives that their government signed on to this not
[26:28.840 --> 26:32.720]  even their debt but they use financial ignorance to carry out this entire
[26:32.720 --> 26:38.280]  fraud and the New York Times is also reporting on this here's another one
[26:38.280 --> 26:42.440]  Greek workers begin general strike anti-austerity walkout called by unions
[26:42.440 --> 26:47.800]  expected to ground flights disrupt local transport and shut down services here's
[26:47.800 --> 26:51.400]  the plan though the bankers brag and the IMF World Bank documents that got leaked
[26:51.400 --> 26:56.800]  in 2002 and Joseph Sticklets left the World Bank we had him on at the time he
[26:56.800 --> 27:00.040]  wouldn't say he released him but you know I'm gonna tell you how the cow ate the
[27:00.040 --> 27:04.160]  cabbage or that a bear goes to the bathroom in the woods but it was how
[27:04.160 --> 27:08.240]  they were implanting to do this in the first world and so since 2002 with Greg
[27:08.240 --> 27:11.840]  Paulist and I wrote a chapter in my book about it the sent into tyranny
[27:11.840 --> 27:15.480]  explaining they would do this here with derivatives sign us on that's 10 years
[27:15.480 --> 27:19.600]  ago on record I said this would happen and then always poses the saviors
[27:19.600 --> 27:26.880]  imploding us each step of the way and so they use what they call the IMF World
[27:26.880 --> 27:30.600]  Bank riot as things implode they know you're gonna riot well they just sit
[27:30.600 --> 27:34.360]  back offshore as the society even implodes more and then use that as a way
[27:34.360 --> 27:39.560]  to drive down the value of property and companies even more to then come in with
[27:39.560 --> 27:43.280]  more fiat money and buy it all up see that's why they destroy countries one
[27:43.280 --> 27:48.560]  at a time though you notice that this is a systematic gobbling because if a
[27:48.560 --> 27:52.920]  country ever resists and turns the tide and they ever get exposed the globalist
[27:52.920 --> 27:57.080]  will back off they know that goes worldwide and people wake up they could
[27:57.080 --> 28:01.720]  join together worldwide or in coalitions and go arrest the globalists so they
[28:01.720 --> 28:05.760]  take countries one at a time it's a military tactic you take one island one
[28:05.760 --> 28:10.360]  country at a time you exploit that country against the next it's also
[28:10.360 --> 28:14.040]  communist control system they learned from the British so that's what we're
[28:14.040 --> 28:21.120]  seeing here an island hopping takeover continuing here London independent
[28:21.120 --> 28:26.000]  Angela Merkel Europe must stay the course on painful reform raising every
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.440]  form of taxes on small businesses exempting big ones cutting all sorts of
[28:30.440 --> 28:35.960]  benefits but raising taxes to give tens of trillions of dollars to mega banks
[28:35.960 --> 28:41.560]  now look it's it's happening here to household incomes falls in August off 8.2

[28:48.160 --> 28:52.120]  winehouse and the Federal Reserve are the ones the private bank sent same
[28:52.120 --> 28:56.680]  European stockholders saying we need to tax the rich people even though they've
[28:56.680 --> 29:01.240]  written the laws so the billionaires are exempt that they say tax the guy you know
[29:01.240 --> 29:05.040]  it tax the guy and his wife making a quarter million a year who actually goes
[29:05.040 --> 29:09.920]  to your restaurant goes to your store or or hires you get rid of them you can

[29:16.880 --> 29:22.600]  anymore this is the plan they don't want independent wealth they want mega rich
[29:22.600 --> 29:26.600]  exempt globally from the laws they passed domestically so there it is
[29:26.600 --> 29:29.840]  they break down how they're coming up all these big new taxes and the fellow
[29:29.840 --> 29:36.080]  reserves promoting VAT which is in the Republican Party platform now on top of
[29:36.080 --> 29:40.600]  the income tax a VAT which brings government surveillance over every

[33:43.280 --> 33:49.640]  the world by stealth corruption by takeover by infiltration that the great
[33:49.640 --> 33:53.680]  Roman philosopher and statesman Cicero talked about the traitor is the plague
[33:53.680 --> 34:00.040]  print me that quote again guys thank you and now they've got all of our resources
[34:00.040 --> 34:05.600]  and our work and the taxes we pay to use against us and then they come out and
[34:05.600 --> 34:09.200]  lie because we wake up and know there's no law to take vaccines we learn how
[34:09.200 --> 34:14.080]  deadly they are and now they say okay we told you it was the law it wasn't now
[34:14.080 --> 34:19.960]  we're gonna pass laws to shoot into you whatever big pharma says even though big
[34:19.960 --> 34:24.560]  pharma has been caught doing secret medical testing and killing innocent
[34:24.560 --> 34:30.320]  people for a hundred years and most big pharma is eugenics owned and run if not
[34:30.320 --> 34:34.680]  by the Nazis by the groups that created the Nazis in the US England and France
[34:34.680 --> 34:41.040]  think about how crazy it is to be involved in any of this of course these
[34:41.040 --> 34:45.040]  big eugenics based companies that see us as animals and their religion is
[34:45.040 --> 34:48.960]  poisoning us and killing us of course they're engineering the wheat and GMO
[34:48.960 --> 34:53.000]  corn to sterilize all the rodents that eat it of course we're losing our
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.000]  fertility of course they've got estrogen mixed into the plastics to
[34:57.000 --> 35:02.400]  sterilize us of course the AP even admitted a few years ago that hundreds of
[35:02.400 --> 35:07.560]  major water supplies have levels of Prozac way above what could be there
[35:07.560 --> 35:12.680]  from runoff from sewage and they did studies it wasn't a particular type of

[35:23.400 --> 35:30.600]  under attack but by being conscious of it by being aware of it of the toxic
[35:30.600 --> 35:35.680]  toxification you can battle back against the enemy and become aware of them
[35:35.680 --> 35:43.000]  but you've got to know you've been hit we're under soft kill and I'm gonna be

[43:52.400 --> 43:56.200]  want to say on this and I'm gonna get back into the news I said something
[43:56.200 --> 44:01.320]  yesterday on air and I say stuff all the time that's a that's a fragment of
[44:01.320 --> 44:06.080]  of what I really meant to say I was driving home last night and heard my
[44:06.080 --> 44:10.840]  show being rebroadcast here locally and I was making the point about once you
[44:10.840 --> 44:14.920]  realize this is all a matrix like facade the globalist are trying to insert us
[44:14.920 --> 44:19.240]  into you got reality going on but you've also got them trying to project the
[44:19.240 --> 44:23.720]  false reality and force it into our lives big sis breaking in on your cell
[44:23.720 --> 44:29.360]  phones EAS alerts government propaganda placement all the big sitcoms being paid
[44:29.360 --> 44:34.640]  to promote Obamacare the messages in the culture of the state brainwashing your
[44:34.640 --> 44:41.280]  kids and I was saying that's why it isn't about ego it isn't about status it
[44:41.280 --> 44:47.360]  isn't about being famous I mean it was a little bit of that 17 years ago when I
[44:47.360 --> 44:51.040]  first got on air wanting recognition wanting to be involved wanting to stand
[44:51.040 --> 44:54.680]  up wanting to wanting to you know stand out wanting to be special and that's
[44:54.680 --> 44:58.400]  that's a human trait we know we're an incredible species but I'd mainly got
[44:58.400 --> 45:01.920]  involved being on air because I didn't want to lose my second
[45:01.920 --> 45:04.800]  amendment or property rights I didn't like tyrants trying to run my life
[45:04.800 --> 45:11.800]  that's 90% of why I got involved but now the 10% of ego is pretty much gone all
[45:11.800 --> 45:17.040]  I have is total dedication and resistance to tyranny that's what propels me is
[45:17.040 --> 45:22.640]  is is competitiveness against the evil not wanting it to win it's an instinctive
[45:22.640 --> 45:27.840]  genetic drive manifesting itself through my intellectual faculties and you have
[45:27.840 --> 45:31.640]  the potential to be much more effective than I've been you are incredible you
[45:31.640 --> 45:35.680]  have value that's why the globalists tell you your trash but I was saying it
[45:35.680 --> 45:39.880]  means nothing when a big Hollywood star calls me now it means nothing when some
[45:39.880 --> 45:44.360]  famous rock star and I mean I get calls almost every week it means nothing if
[45:44.360 --> 45:51.000]  they just call up and don't want to go on air and what I mean is it means
[45:51.000 --> 45:56.760]  nothing that a famous person's calling me for my ego it only means something as
[45:56.760 --> 46:01.720]  a signpost as a radar ping a sonar ping that hey we're reaching more and more
[46:01.720 --> 46:05.080]  people and are becoming more and more effective just like I get excited when
[46:05.080 --> 46:08.800]  some old lady shakes my hand on the street or a old black man or a young
[46:08.800 --> 46:12.440]  black man or a young white woman or a young Hispanic woman whatever whoever
[46:12.440 --> 46:18.120]  they are that's a radar ping a sonar ping that we're having a big effect but
[46:18.120 --> 46:21.720]  it was a fragment it wasn't that oh I don't care when famous people call me I
[46:21.720 --> 46:27.360]  do care when they call me but I care because I'm talking to an artist and
[46:27.360 --> 46:32.280]  interesting soul who is awake now and it's cool to talk to them but it's just
[46:32.280 --> 46:37.480]  as cool to talk to a regular person at the grocery store they're always a go
[46:37.480 --> 46:40.520]  thank you for you do you're so great here's my son here's my daughter will
[46:40.520 --> 46:43.560]  you take a picture with them and it's like no no it's honor it's a great
[46:43.560 --> 46:51.560]  honor to meet you I see you and you know I I see that you're another free soul
[46:51.560 --> 46:55.280]  that wants liberty we're fellow travelers together we're on the same
[46:55.280 --> 47:00.320]  journey we have the same goal of freedom and justice so don't tell me how
[47:00.320 --> 47:04.880]  great I am you're great and in the realization of how much potential we've
[47:04.880 --> 47:10.160]  got is the realization that we can survive and thrive and that's all I'm
[47:10.160 --> 47:13.160]  trying to get out here so I mean I heard myself say I don't care what somebody
[47:13.160 --> 47:19.720]  famous calls me it means nothing it's all fake anyways what I meant was it is
[47:19.720 --> 47:25.480]  such a thrill to have 36,000 of these sell out in 36 hours we didn't do that
[47:25.480 --> 47:32.160]  on purpose it just happened 36 hours 36,000 sold out it is such a thrill to
[47:32.160 --> 47:36.240]  hold the physical thing in your hand and to see it get light years better than
[47:36.240 --> 47:39.800]  the first issue that was great that was great this is excellent it's gonna get
[47:39.800 --> 47:44.040]  even better once it becomes somewhat profitable which I'd have the price so
[47:44.040 --> 47:48.320]  low it won't but we hope with advertising it does I mean to make the
[47:48.320 --> 47:53.640]  thing 80 something pages not 48 pages you know we're we're just I mean let me
[47:53.640 --> 47:59.960]  tell you this is a world-class magazine already it's so much fun to envision this
[47:59.960 --> 48:03.680]  art because I came up with this concept the cover concept and and to see my
[48:03.680 --> 48:08.640]  graphics team Janae Meadows and others work together to then manifest my idea
[48:08.640 --> 48:14.280]  of the black pyramid and then to see the articles written and the work and to see
[48:14.280 --> 48:19.440]  it done that's what's thrilling it is so dead to be at a Hollywood party with
[48:19.440 --> 48:23.600]  professional basketball players and A-list celebrities and all of these
[48:23.600 --> 48:30.720]  number 10 women absolutely all they're so empty they're so unhappy none of its
[48:30.720 --> 48:34.640]  real them their managers are there phone calls are coming in they're dead
[48:34.640 --> 48:40.040]  they're unhappy no fulfillment but to sit around with a famous Hollywood person
[48:40.040 --> 48:43.800]  around their computer for 10 hours drinking coffee researching the New
[48:43.800 --> 48:50.880]  World Order and 9-11 that's thrilling I mean you see what I'm saying reality is
[48:50.880 --> 48:54.840]  fulfilling the globalists don't want you to feel fulfilled so you go to them to
[48:54.840 --> 48:59.680]  be fulfilled when the universe is all around you creation and beauty and all
[48:59.680 --> 49:05.280]  that is good is so amazing we simply have to sell the truth and sell beauty
[49:05.280 --> 49:11.760]  and sell what is good and point out the bad we have to simply present good and
[49:11.760 --> 49:15.640]  people will choose it over the bad but they tell you there is no good and evil
[49:15.640 --> 49:20.960]  so that they can direct you and so that's all I'm trying to say here is
[49:20.960 --> 49:28.840]  that it is so thrilling to get up and to be upset and to learn that they're
[49:28.840 --> 49:32.720]  running over poor Chinese farmers with steamrollers that don't want to give up
[49:32.720 --> 49:36.760]  their property and to know that they're murdering them and just like Tiananmen
[49:36.760 --> 49:39.960]  Square but that our media won't cover it now because we're bought and paid for
[49:39.960 --> 49:45.440]  about China and been totally sold out so it's painful it's upsetting Watson's
[49:45.440 --> 49:50.120]  working on an article Watson writes the article Matt drudge drudge report calm
[49:50.120 --> 49:55.760]  posted it's picked up by scores of newspapers today and do you think I
[49:55.760 --> 49:59.240]  care when most of the newspapers didn't give us credit for his Chinese wife
[49:59.240 --> 50:04.560]  noticing that and you know breaking it I could care less because the thrill of
[50:04.560 --> 50:10.200]  the fact that that guy who stood who's who who who didn't get up and let the
[50:10.200 --> 50:15.040]  steamroller run over them that person that is so admirable that person that
[50:15.040 --> 50:25.600]  is so strong that that that they did that for humanity and that and that their
[50:25.600 --> 50:30.040]  death didn't happen in vain and that that information went out to expose that
[50:30.040 --> 50:35.440]  murderous communist gender 21 model country that the bankers run the fact
[50:35.440 --> 50:40.000]  that he is it made me angry that that man was killed and it made me angry that
[50:40.000 --> 50:46.520]  nobody knew about it but by getting out now his sacrifice had an effect and it's
[50:46.520 --> 50:51.480]  so thrilling it's like giant buckets of diamonds to unlock mines that's what I'm

[54:28.080 --> 54:33.320]  vaccines on record I've got guests coming up in about 35 minutes who are
[54:33.320 --> 54:38.880]  suing over an investigation team there's big news out on it today where the
[54:38.880 --> 54:44.320]  EPA is pumping toxic gas into hospitals I mean you can't make this stuff up and
[54:44.320 --> 54:48.680]  I'm sorry you know we're in trouble because all the men are like yeah I bought
[54:48.680 --> 54:52.600]  a case of beer watching the game everybody's like man that's manly yeah I
[54:52.600 --> 54:59.880]  know I'm manly and again I mean my grandfather went to UT with Tom Landry
[54:59.880 --> 55:03.520]  was his roommate played football where they've been one first place in the
[55:03.520 --> 55:08.200]  hurdles it's state you know my whole family's football football football I
[55:08.200 --> 55:13.120]  grew up watching football I like football okay don't get me wrong but it's
[55:13.120 --> 55:19.160]  become a mental illness okay I played football was not very good at it and it
[55:19.160 --> 55:22.280]  was hellish when I was a freshman that they put me on varsity and I got run
[55:22.280 --> 55:25.240]  over over and over again I was like why am I one of three guys you just put on
[55:25.240 --> 55:29.560]  varsity I don't know which end is up well you hurt people we don't know why
[55:29.560 --> 55:34.160]  but you always seem to hurt somebody and that's what we like I was old-fashioned
[55:34.160 --> 55:38.560]  football you're not supposed to talk like that anymore the point is is that
[55:38.560 --> 55:44.280]  ladies and gentlemen we are not focused on what is important in this country and
[55:44.280 --> 55:51.600]  in this society we are not focused on the core things and you've heard them
[55:51.600 --> 55:54.720]  they're announcing they're gonna raise taxes no matter who gets an office to
[55:54.720 --> 55:59.720]  give it to foreign banks and that makes me angry you know I've got wave those
[55:59.720 --> 56:03.920]  rancheros because I meant to stand up for my family not because I meant to
[56:03.920 --> 56:08.640]  strut around and go I'm football I've bugged my eyes out of other men at red
[56:08.640 --> 56:12.880]  lights because I'm tough you're supposed to get out there and bug your eyes out
[56:12.880 --> 56:16.800]  at the bureaucrats who were bugging their eyes out at you dominating you and
[56:16.800 --> 56:21.840]  your family but again we sold out I just want to plug this now that I have the

[56:39.360 --> 56:43.840]  hoping to turn a profit just with advertising with this hadn't happened
[56:43.840 --> 56:47.600]  yet but we almost broke even the point is I've got these prices you're like well
[56:47.600 --> 56:52.800]  Alex if you sold them all out in 36 hours last time 36,000 you had extra
[56:52.800 --> 56:56.840]  you sold out in 36 hours why are you still selling them at cost because what I
[56:56.840 --> 57:02.320]  just said before the break I'm looking for the mines unlocked that's what
[57:02.320 --> 57:07.520]  thrills me and if I do give these out at cost people buy a lot more of them and
[57:07.520 --> 57:12.640]  it gets into more people's hands if this continues we only printed a hundred
[57:12.640 --> 57:16.560]  thousand this time we printed 90,000 last time if these sell out again I'm
[57:16.560 --> 57:20.200]  gonna print 200,000 next time and then 300,000 who knows you guys may buy a
[57:20.200 --> 57:25.040]  million of these at cost and I'll just keep doing it and let me tell you it's
[57:25.040 --> 57:28.200]  having a big effect around the country I'm gonna quit plugging that info or

[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:17.360]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.800]  Alex Jones
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:34.040]  we are in to hour number two we have big breaking news with our reporters that
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:38.480]  went down to film the NSA spy base there's not just a big new one in Utah
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:43.920]  Jakari Jackson Melissa Melton got pound stomber me breaking that down that just
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:48.040]  happened join us for the next 30 minutes is dr. Paul Craig Roberts then we have
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:52.840]  whistleblowers filing suit over the EPA pumping toxic gas into hospitals on
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:57.480]  purpose you cannot make this stuff up so that's coming up dr. Paul Craig
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:01.480]  Roberts of course his former head of policy at the US Treasury one of the top
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:04.680]  economists out there Forbes magazine and others have reported over the years
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:09.800]  and he's accurately predicted what's happening in the world economy so I
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:13.160]  want to get his take on that and then his syndicated columns that are breaking
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:18.480]  down of the funding of al Qaeda to attack Libby and Syria now I ran and where he
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:24.600]  thinks that's going and we will also give you his website it's Paul Craig
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:29.920]  Roberts dot org and he joins us now doc this is a short segment as you know but
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:34.840]  long segment coming up wow things are deteriorating fast it looks like Spain
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.880]  and other places are going the way of Argentina
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:45.000]  well they might on the other hand Alex that hype is very useful to the banks
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.320]  because they can make a lot of money with interest rate swaps with shorting
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:58.120]  Spanish debt with credit default swaps against the debt so it's you know it's
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:04.960]  unless you spend half the day on that problem it's hard to know how much of
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:10.280]  that is really real and serious and how much is it hype for money making
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:16.120]  opportunities by Wall Street sure all I know is they're engineering a financial
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:20.280]  collapse while posing as the saviors and doing bailouts that are really wealth
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:25.440]  transfers themselves and they they talk about this new agenda 21 post industrial
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.640]  model and you point out that you know we can't have a recovery because they
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:35.480]  deindustrialize this I mean there's a method of the madness well yes they're
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:42.520]  and there's a variety of methods and it's certainly the case that after what
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:47.480]  has it been now four years or more of very easy money in fact the easiest
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:52.200]  monetary bottles in our history the largest budget deficits there's still
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:59.480]  no recovery and there can't be one because as our friend John Williams has
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:08.960]  pointed out the consumer incomes real consumer incomes deflated by the CPI
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:16.820]  are today where they were in 1967 so in terms of real purchasing power the
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:22.180]  Americans have no more money than they had in 1967 and in fact it's even worse
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:28.960]  than that Alex because a Don to avoid too much controversy uses the CPI but he
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:34.520]  has shown that the CPI itself dramatically understates the inflation
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:40.200]  and if you were to deflate American incomes today by a more realistic
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:47.440]  measure and they would have less money today than they had in 1967 so how do
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:52.360]  you get a recovery there's no consumer income and we've talked about this
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:59.680]  before and the Federal Reserve relied for years on the expansion of consumer
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:03.840]  debt and rising housing prices and refinancing the houses and spending the
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.560]  equity to keep the economy going but that's over with two so there's no way
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:16.800]  this can that there can be a recovery and in in in Europe it's it's an equally
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:23.560]  bad situation because what is really happening is that the EU is using what
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:29.600]  they call the sovereign debt crisis in order to destroy the sovereignty of the
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:35.660]  individual member states that the EU intends to burn Germany and France
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:39.520]  doc stay there we got to go to break let's come back and start at square one
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:44.040]  here your breakdown of the real estate of the world economy where you think
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:49.240]  it's going what QE infinity means your take on what's happening in Europe and
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.920]  then how that ties into the larger funding of al-qaeda to go haywire all
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:59.120]  over the world we'll break it all down straight ahead the worst drought in 50
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:03.160]  years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:08.120]  record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:12.880]  soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:16.480]  to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:20.440]  your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:24.600]  cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:28.280]  now as the price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:32.200]  prices to now is the time to get your supply I recently increased my supply
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.320]  from e-foods direct because we've all known this was coming you know about
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:39.600]  their delicious long-term storable foods the fact is you can eat at any time to

[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:03.000]  craigroberts.org former head of policy at the u.s. treasury the father of
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.200]  ergonomics and he also of course was the one of the main editors the wall street
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:12.720]  journal and business week and he joins us now senior fellow at the Hoover
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:17.600]  Institute top economist to break down QE unlimited what it means what we're
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:24.040]  seeing Europe and and where this invariably leads dr. roberts okay first
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:32.560]  year the crisis is being used by banks to impose the cost on private
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:36.880]  individuals and to establish the principle that they are not responsible
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:43.200]  for their own losses but that the losses of private banks can be farmed out to
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:49.800]  the general population same thing that happened here also in Europe the European
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:54.280]  Central Bank and the European Union are using the crisis to centralize power
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:11:02.520]  over the member countries and so the crisis itself to the extent that it's
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:12.480]  real is being hyped to serve those two purposes as well and so since they are
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:19.640]  focused not on solving the crisis but using it to achieve other agendas then
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:27.240]  the economic problems are not being addressed and we covered proud of the
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:32.440]  break the situation here there's no basis for a recovery all the good jobs
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:37.520]  have been sent offshore and the only jobs that the United States seems able to
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:44.000]  create are low pay domestic service jobs waiters bartenders hospital orders now
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:51.640]  the situation on the warfront what we saw with the Libyan assassination of the
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:59.280]  American ambassador the capture of the CIA records in the safe house I think
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:07.960]  what we are now seeing finally is a response of the Muslims to the
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:13.240]  domination of their life culture and all the bombing and drones and
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:20.880]  assassinations by the United States and Europe for the last 30 40 years they
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:29.720]  finally they finally got mad and so we we saw these uprising these outbreaks in
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:33.640]  about 20 countries we saw the French and the Germans at least temporarily
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:40.760]  closing their embassies the American embassy in Baruch is shredding its
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:46.200]  documents in fear that they also wouldn't fall in the hands of some of these
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:53.960]  Islamists so it looks like if this sort of thing continues there and it gets
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:13:00.320]  worse the West simply will be ejected from the Middle East they won't be able
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:06.400]  to maintain a presence there without embassies they can't purchase the
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:11.920]  governments and make the payments to the governments and so the the kind of
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:16.520]  hegemy that the New York Conservatives expected to establish over the Middle
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:24.200]  East would be lost in the meantime the United States continues to try to
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:31.920]  bottle up China with naval air and troop bases even while the defense chief
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:37.320]  tells the Chinese that all these bases aren't directed at you just like to tell
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:41.240]  the Russians that all these missile bases aren't directed at you you see the
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.880]  United States government so used to lying to the American people and being
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:50.040]  believed they think the Russians and Chinese will believe them too amazing
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:53.760]  let me digress for a moment here because we know the West and NATO used
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.120]  al-Qaeda to take over Libya they're using them to blow up bases and attack Syria
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:01.840]  that's on record they're forcing people to be suicide bombers or they kill
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:05.200]  their families our media puts this out like it's a beautiful wonderful thing
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:11.440]  we're seeing a schizophrenic policy where there is no morals in the elite but
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:16.200]  power and they're totally opportunistic but now it's like a snake eating its
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:23.560]  own tail their own precious al-Qaeda is now striking back against them and
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:26.960]  they're telling us give our rights up because al-Qaeda is going to attack you
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:32.120]  I mean the whole narrative is it just makes no sense unless you're completely
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:37.000]  brain dead so maybe some Americans heavily fluoridated still by it but
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.240]  nobody overseas nobody that's got two brain cells rubbed together or who can
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:46.040]  tie their shoelaces or wipe their nose buys any of this I mean this is this is
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:52.400]  this does look like collective insanity yes you say and what Washington has done
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:15:02.240]  by destroying the secular governments that sat on these Islamist forces by
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:07.920]  destroying Saddam Hussein by practically destroying Assad by destroying
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:16.320]  Gaddafi they've unleashed all of these very virulent and extremist Islamist
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:24.240]  forces that are determined to throw off all forms of Western influence you know
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:31.600]  and and so how can they control it now they can't the way it was controlled was
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:39.560]  by the people we've overthrown so we've produced the snake pet for our self and
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:43.680]  of course the people in Washington no one will want to admit that somehow their
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:49.360]  policy was wrong or is or is backfired and so they will stick with the same
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:55.320]  stupid policy just so they don't have to admit they were wrong until it destroys
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:16:02.320]  them and I think that's what basically they face so what what do you do we have
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:10.280]  the fiscal cliff it will be evaded just like Congress evades the debt limit the
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:16.680]  budget resolution they evade everything that's a real problem and they they
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:22.760]  continue all of this pretense so in the end there's nothing but pretense and so
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:28.200]  I think this is really what brings down the empire and it saves us from the
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:33.760]  police state so it's an empire of delusion so it's a culture and an empire
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:40.320]  of delusion in fact my next article is called the culture of delusion and I
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:47.080]  think that there's so many different agendas wrapped up in this and they're
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:53.440]  all deluded you know look Alex what public policy debate consists of
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:59.000]  anything but lies and propaganda but what political decision is ever made it's
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.440]  not a lie oh it's amazing I've studied you know our policies our country's ever
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:07.200]  been perfect but 50 years ago the State Department really did try to build up
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:12.360]  countries and industrialize them now it tries to destroy them I mean I mean it
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:19.000]  really is a a degeneration not that the ruling class was ever good guys because
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.320]  power tends to corrupt as you know as a historian you know not just an
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:26.040]  economist but but but now they're smoking their own dope in the
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:30.000]  establishment and they're destroying their own checks and balances that have
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.680]  protected them they're they're building a wood shipper that they want to feed us
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:39.240]  into but they're the ones that are gonna end up going into it that's right I
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:47.040]  think that's a good way to put it and so the basis for hope is that there are so
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:56.400]  many agendas based on total lies and that it that has produced so many
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:02.240]  miscalculations that it'll all come back on their heads now the real question is
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:08.320]  when they see that happening will they push the button yeah and and who knows
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:15.000]  about I think the best position that any American can take is to never believe
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:21.080]  one word from the government not one word it will never tell them the truth
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:27.520]  about anything and there's no prospect of them being able to tell the truth
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:33.720]  because the agendas are wrapped up in mendacity and the worst kinds of crimes
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:41.960]  and ambitions and so are the hoax so are they desperate or are they megalomaniacs
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:46.200]  I know it's a mix of the both but I mean certainly they're all in they're
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:51.720]  committed to this and so that makes them a dangerous foe well they make some
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:55.480]  dangers to the world and to the American people you see they've taken away our
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:59.920]  civil liberties they've built these internment camps they they've they've
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:06.560]  broken the posse comatitis law so they're they're prepared to use the same
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:11.520]  force and violence against American citizens that they use against the
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:17.880]  Iraqis the Afghans the Pakistanis the Yemenis the Libyans so what's happened
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:24.840]  is persuasion and argument convincing people this is no longer their policy
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:28.840]  it's violence force force and violence sure look at the Chinese we're going to
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.640]  break we're never until 40 after and we've got our next guest on with breaking
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:35.520]  news but you're absolutely right the Chinese have gotten 98% according to
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:39.960]  Wall Street Journal of rare earth minerals by soft power by building people
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:45.920]  up and meanwhile our government uses force to take everything and it's it's
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:50.360]  it's they are madmen we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen and sure they're
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:55.320]  cogent but they're cogent like Hitler was I mean they know deep down they're
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:20:01.560]  insane the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:06.280]  2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:10.560]  in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:15.040]  are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:18.720]  and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:22.840]  counter this is to freeze your food cost in today's prices by getting your own
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:27.360]  supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:31.040]  e-foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to get your supply I

[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:12.200]  turning a compost bin or the smell then check out the EM Bokashi food waste
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:16.320]  recycling system from tarragonics finally a way to recycle all your food and
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:20.720]  plant waste safely and effectively and stop using fertilizers the EM Bokashi

[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:17.500]  are gonna look at breaking the federal government gassing people inside
[01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:23.120]  hospitals and there's thousands of declassifications radiating little kids
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:25.520]  you name it I mean this has been going on a while and they brought in the
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:29.440]  paperclip scientists the eugenics arm but that's how they've grown their cult
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:34.680]  of ruthless people and now they've taken over dr. Roberts look when you read
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:38.480]  what you know some of the top globalists are saying that they talk about a
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:43.320]  post-industrial world a collapsing society this fake green society they've
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:48.080]  kind of created a cosmology and you see the big banks Goldman Sachs JP Morgan
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:51.960]  funding it funding these different movements telling it's it's good to be
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:56.080]  austere they've somehow convinced the public that most these new taxes
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:00.080]  Europe's having to pay go to pay off their debts but really most of it is the
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:05.640]  derivatives how do they get away with this is it the total financial ignorance
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:11.520]  of the public that they're able to sign us on to their debts and then and then
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:15.560]  the bankers get appointed as the prime ministers and presidents and then they
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:20.880]  lecture us about how we shouldn't be able to take a hot shower while they have
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:24.360]  giant palaces and yachts I mean do they just think the police state's gonna
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:27.800]  protect them I mean why do they think they're God I mean where do you see
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:33.440]  this going well you know they get away with it Alex because the print and TV
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:38.960]  media are their servants you know Selen to cause it the prostitute media and
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:43.960]  that's what it is it's they get away with it because of propaganda and now to
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:48.440]  learn different you have to watch Alex Jones or read certain parts of the
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:54.840]  internet and for people who don't know how to judge and who traditionally
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:26:03.240]  relied on TV and newspapers this is a long time process of unlearning that
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:06.960]  these are not reliable sources that you want to know what's happening you've
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:11.760]  got to find information somewhere else and it's a difficult challenge for most
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:16.160]  people they don't have the time or the inclination or the know-how they don't
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:22.120]  know who to trust they just feel adrift you know there was this article just out
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:28.880]  from a former New York Times foreign correspondent who quit he said the New
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:32.880]  York Times is nothing but a propaganda machine for the United States government
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:38.880]  for the military security complex that I was being forced to write false reports
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:46.360]  to support the propaganda lines well as more of that comes out people might
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:52.800]  eventually catch on and learn where they can get a good information but that is
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:57.720]  a huge problem for people that just the lack of information well let's get back
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:01.600]  to the economy briefly here absolutely right there's a new study out today
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:06.840]  showing a record number depending on the 65 to over 70% depending on which
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:10.800]  political group don't trust the mainstream media but like you said they
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:14.600]  don't even know what's real them but let me ask you this real quick what does QE
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:18.520]  unlimited mean you called it a well-transfer to the elite again earlier
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:23.280]  basically what does that mean and and I understand they're hyping collapse now
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:28.720]  to get more bailouts but where are we going in this post-industrial world well
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:35.080]  first of all post-industrial world is just it's just a term they use for their
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:41.680]  agenda there's no such thing sure now but you ask about QE 3 unlimited what it
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:48.320]  means is the Federal Reserve is going to continue to purchase bonds that means
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:53.240]  they're going to monetize the debt continuously because by purchasing these
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:58.960]  bonds they prevent interest rates from rising on the bonds in fact they've been
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:04.440]  successful in lowering interest rates so that the interest rate on a United
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:08.760]  States Treasury bond is negative because it's lower than the rate of
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:14.120]  inflation now when they make the interest rates drop they make the book
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:19.960]  value of the debt instruments on the banks balance sheets rise so it creates
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:27.200]  more appearances of solvency so this whole thing is directed at keeping the
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:32.080]  banks solvent or making them more solvent by driving interest rates even
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:37.280]  more negative now what are the consequences the consequences are at
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:45.320]  some time the rest of the world will finally realize that the unlimited
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:51.480]  expansion of US debt and its monetization means they don't want to be
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:58.200]  in dollars now if they if foreigners like China don't the bonds the Federal
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:04.320]  Reserve can print the money to buy them and keep the bond prices high but when
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:08.960]  the foreigners say the Chinese get the dollars for the bonds and they dump the
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:15.600]  dollars the Federal Reserve can't print foreign currencies to buy up the dollar
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:23.920]  so I think the QE unlimited what it means is the end of the dollar it will
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:31.400]  simply be seen as a monopoly play money that's been created in such profusion
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:36.840]  that nobody wants to hold assets denominated in dollars all right hold
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:40.200]  your holder right there that is so bombshell without the Roberts come back
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:45.080]  and quantify that expand on that for the lame men and women out there straight
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:51.680]  ahead this is this is a big deal we're on the March the empires on the run Alex

[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:12.560]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:15.980]  living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:19.000]  police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.160]  beginning of history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:25.640]  beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture even today
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:29.360]  Japanese eat miso Africans eat fermented porches Koreans eat

[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:15.120]  later in the next hour there's a Paul Joseph Watson article I haven't even
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:20.320]  gotten to yet that's how much incredible news there is we're on C-span they talk
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:24.680]  about a false flag to be blamed on Iran I mean that's how dumb the ruling class
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:29.360]  thinks you are they had Gary Hart five years ago write a letter doc meant
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:35.040]  energy to buy ran and he said hey our government stage and stuff Gulf of Tonkin
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:41.120]  Lusitania the main other events you better do what you're told and some said
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:44.520]  it was a warning we actually interviewed Gary Hart it's in the film
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:48.360]  Truth Rising Luke Radowski didn't we are changing he admitted to it I mean he put
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:52.240]  it on the Huffington Post not like it's a secret but this new video I saw it this
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:55.720]  morning and Richard Reeves is like why aren't you covering this during the break
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:58.400]  and I went oh I meant to I mean it's people are always like why didn't you
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:03.200]  cover this I got like a hundred articles in here and I've it's just it's
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:09.960]  insane the amount of craziness that's going on and the fact that the rulers
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:13.040]  that run everything I want to get Dr. Robert's take on this and then get back
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:19.120]  into what QE 3 or unlimited or in QE infinity symbolizes the end of the
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:23.640]  dollar of the World Reserve currency I mean that's that's the end of the
[01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:27.960]  Empire unless they start World War 3 and you notice that's all lined up right
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:32.440]  now the ships off the coast of China getting the conflict between Japan and
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:36.720]  China going this looks like what we saw before World War 1 World War 2 and I'm
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:40.600]  not just saying that a lot of top analysts are saying that and then I'm
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:44.560]  reminded this video that's up at info wars.com which I just reprinted guys we
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:47.080]  run that into me right now I know it printed because I just printed it like
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:53.960]  four minutes ago it's just mind-blowing but Dr. Roberts before you get into that
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:35:00.520]  briefly get back into what QE 3 actually means and what that what that
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:07.240]  symbolizes well it's the way the Federal Reserve finances the deficit I think I
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:15.120]  saw recently that three-fourths of the federal deficit is financed by the Fed
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:21.160]  buying the bonds this is the behavior of a banana Republic now the reason we
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:25.440]  haven't had exploding inflation is that the money is locked up in the banks
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:30.400]  because the consumers are too broke to borrow and the banks are too afraid to
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:36.040]  lend and they need the cash in case the derivative thing comes unglued and they
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:41.240]  have to start settling their debts to one another so all of the money that the
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:46.280]  Fed has created hasn't really had the inflationary impact because it's locked
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:52.760]  up in bank reserves they're sitting on it now the whole part about QE there
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:58.280]  there are two two aspects of that the Fed can forever create the money to
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:05.360]  support bond prices and thus keep low interest rates but if people dump the
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.720]  dollar itself the Fed is helpless because it cannot print foreign currencies
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:16.280]  to buy up the dollars and so as the dollar loses its value what happens is
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:20.600]  people abandon the stock market the real estate market the bond market the
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:26.560]  currency itself and all of a sudden the dollar is no longer the reserve currency
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:32.600]  and all of a sudden United States can no longer pay for its imports by
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:40.520]  earning money so it ends the power it the empire crumbles overnight the war stop
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:46.680]  because there's no means of financing them most likely suburbia dies because
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:52.480]  there's no gasoline everything that we are now dependent on because the
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:58.000]  economy was all short will simply be deprived of because the dollar won't be
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:05.800]  worth anything so that is the downside the potential downside of the Fed
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:11.840]  creating money to buy the bonds now how long can this be kept going well as
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:17.560]  long as people don't see an alternative or as long as the United States can
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:22.120]  create say a crisis for the euro you know we've had the euro in crisis now all
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:30.000]  these years this serves the Fed in Washington in keeping the dollar flow
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:35.240]  because you can't run to the euro you can't run to the Swiss Frank because the
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:39.440]  Swiss government said when you come here we're going to print the Franks to give
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:42.680]  you for your dollars so you can't make any more money speculating on our
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:50.480]  currency the Chinese are not open their currency up and and so and the Japanese
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:57.280]  don't want the role so it's sort of Washington thanks it can forever keep
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:03.280]  the dollar there despite the fact that it's debasing it now sooner or later
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:07.800]  something is going to break somebody is going to say we don't want these dollars
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:16.680]  this is not worth it let us out and then that's when it all comes unglued now
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:20.680]  obviously they've got the police state the camps ready the military they think
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:23.080]  they're just gonna have a big war with everybody and that's going to keep the
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:26.920]  bankers out of trouble and they can use the crisis to get even more power they're
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:30.800]  getting there agenda 21 federal takeover every town ready they've got their
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:34.400]  federalization cards handed out to all their minions they've got their spy
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:38.360]  networks and for guards set up I got to tell you doc it looks like they've got
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:43.640]  this all planned out I've got a article here that's up at info wars comm in the
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:47.720]  featured news area I'm going to make it the top story I'm going to call Watson
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:52.400]  having move it to the top story lobbyist launch stage provocation to start war
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:57.040]  with Iran and I saw this this morning and I've just gotten so conditioned to
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.320]  know they're staging all this that I didn't even meet cover it the first
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:04.800]  hour and a half we are in the game of using covert means against the Iranians
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:10.440]  a member of the influential pro-Israeli Washington Institute for Near East
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:15.720]  Policy when if think tank is brazenly suggested on C-span that the United
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:19.120]  States should launch a false flag provocation in order to start our war
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:23.200]  with Iran speaking on C-span for the Washington Institute for Near East
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:28.080]  Policy from a luncheon on how to build a US-Israel coalition I'm preventing Iran
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:32.120]  from nuclear breakout when if director of research Patrick Kloss enlisted a
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:36.080]  raft of historical examples of where governments have either staged or
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:40.280]  exploited attacks in order to become in brawling war and he lists everything
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:44.800]  just I mean this is Alex that's right but that's for Israel that's not for the
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:49.600]  bankers no I understand well I mean Israel live in the mega complex that's
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:56.920]  for Israel and the profits of the military security complex and it could
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:04.680]  it could it could happen but the downside of that could be overwhelming look
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:09.280]  they couldn't remember they couldn't occupy Baghdad after 11 years they can't
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:16.000]  defeat a few thousand Taliban so what chance is it gonna have with Iran or us
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.120]  or China and you have to keep in mind even though I've got these interment
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:28.080]  camps here and spying on everybody it's a big country to occupy and for
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:33.760]  military that couldn't occupy Baghdad it may not be able to occupy the United
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:39.120]  States now of course at least people in Iraq some of the opponents that we
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:43.480]  face will organize and of course the American people aren't and if you try to
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:48.840]  organize the militias the FBI and filtrate you and the rest but under
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:53.360]  extreme duress even Americans might get organized yeah no matter how much
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:56.580]  flora but let me just add to here I was reading from Watson's article I see
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:41:02.560]  Israel NATO the United States Europe all is one big interest Klossen is also a
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:06.480]  former senior economist for the IMF and World Bank and the point is that's who
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:10.640]  was at the meeting so my point is the the the the banksters the military
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:16.520]  industrial complex all these systems are all like like Russian dolls nesting
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:20.880]  within each other so I see it as one block my point is no matter how big the
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:25.440]  crisis even if they publicly created they they use the ignorance of the
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:28.880]  public you know as a way to just get away with it my point is they'll start
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:33.240]  World War three and and tell us we should thank them for it but but but but
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:38.120]  my question to you is and we have the clip here why do you think they're so
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:43.280]  arrogant that they would go on c-span and talk about false flag staging events
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:47.840]  well you know they got away with not 11 so then get away with it they got away
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:53.440]  with murdering Kennedy they Bobby Kennedy John F. Kennedy Martin Luther King
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:56.800]  they they've gotten away with so much they just don't expect to be held
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:00.800]  accountable in fact now you can't hold them accountable because they wore the
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:04.720]  executive branches above the law above the Constitution you know the Bush
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:10.720]  people established all that so I don't think they think they can be held
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:14.880]  accountable I would just say that not everybody is part of this for example
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:21.600]  our European puppets are puppets they're bought and paid for governments but
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:25.520]  their interests diverged from ours they certainly don't want to be at war with
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:31.680]  Russia no that would be glow-in-the-dark time let's let's play the short clip and
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:34.760]  get your take on it let you go doctor we appreciate all your time here's that
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:39.640]  clip this is up at info wars.com I'm moving into the top story this is
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:45.040]  lobbyist launch stage provocation to start war with Iran here is the clip of
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:54.920]  them openly talking about it here it is and then we'll get dr. Roberts take on
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:43:02.120]  all of this I frankly think that crisis initiation is really tough and it's
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:07.960]  very hard for me to see how the United States president can get us to war with
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:15.560]  Iran which leads me to conclude that if in fact compromise is not coming that
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:20.240]  the traditional way of America gets to war is what would be best for you as
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:24.480]  interests some people might think that mr. Roosevelt wanted to get us into the
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:27.600]  world war two as David mentioned you may recall we had to wait for Pearl Harbor
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:31.600]  some people might think mr. Wilson wanted to get us into World War one you
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:35.080]  may recall he had to wait for the Lusitania episode some people might
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:38.360]  think that mr. Johnson wanted to send troops to Vietnam you may recall they
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:42.400]  had to wait for the Gulf of Tonkin episode we didn't go to war with Spain
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:48.680]  until the USS until the main exploded and may I point out that mr. Lincoln did
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:52.160]  not feel he could call out the Federal Army until Fort Sumter was attacked which
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:55.720]  is why he ordered the commander Fort Sumter to do exactly that thing which
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:44:01.440]  the South Carolinians had said would cause an attack so if in fact the
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:04.840]  Iranians aren't going to compromise it would be best if somebody else started
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:10.880]  the war but one can combine other means of pressure with sanctions I mentioned
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:18.280]  that explosion on August 17th we could step up the pressure I mean look people
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:22.480]  Iranian submarines periodically go down someday one of them might not come up who
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:27.640]  would know why we can do a variety of things if we wish to increase the
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:33.880]  pressure I'm not advocating that but I'm just suggesting that this is not a
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:38.200]  either or proposition of you know it's just sanctions has to has to succeed or
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:46.560]  other things we are in the game of using covert means against the Iranians we
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:50.640]  we could get nasty or that okay let's stop right there I don't want to insult
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:55.040]  women and call this guy a feminine but I noticed in history it's always these
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:58.320]  guys have never probably been in a fist fight never been in the military never
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:03.760]  seen people die they're always super wimpy people or even crooks in in the
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:08.320]  past in history would do this in a secret room these guys are so arrogant
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:12.400]  they're waving it around in front of everybody just like I saw Chris Matthews
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:16.280]  talk about staging 9-11 a month and a half before 9-11 he said big buildings
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:19.960]  are coming down he had the heads of the Heart Rubin Commission from the CFR on
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:23.560]  there they were bragging about how America is about to change and laughing
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:29.080]  and celebrating it you just saw Patrick Klosson do that and Dr. Roberts I mean
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:35.680]  what do you make of this of this this this Byzantine a feminine character up
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:41.320]  there showing off in all the tough guys giggling and laughing about starting a
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:48.600]  war whose other people's sons are gonna die in well he's an Israeli operative who
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:54.360]  wants to get rid of the support that Hezbollah has so that Israel can occupy
[01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:59.000]  southern Lebanon and get the water resources and he's up against the
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:05.560]  American military which understands that attacking Iran is not a three-day war or
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:10.240]  six-week war but a really serious thing and the whole lid in the whole area could
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:17.560]  blow off and once Iran is attacked then we are in direct confrontation with Russia
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:25.000]  and China and so the US military or the majority of the top people who made it
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:29.200]  clear they did not interested the US military is already fighting Russia in
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:34.800]  the proxy war in Syria but they don't want to be no I agree with you I agree
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:38.560]  that they know that's what Dempsey came out a month ago and said don't blame us
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:44.840]  if Israel attacks so if they don't want to be at war and of course Obama has not
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:52.280]  been too happy with Netanyahu forcing him into a position against Iran so I
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:55.920]  think that there's still some intelligence there that realizes this is
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:02.680]  not a good move and so this guy is trying to create a situation around that
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:07.960]  and of course there is as you have emphasized all your career a secret
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:14.240]  government something that's down below the surface and they can conduct these
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:20.040]  types of operations regardless of the president or the joint chiefs or even
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:26.720]  the CIA and this sort of dark government or whatever you want to call it is there
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:32.040]  and so this guy's talking to them he says go on and start it we don't care
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:37.480]  what the president thinks or the joint chiefs we've got to serve Israel we've
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:41.800]  got to get rid of Hezbollah's a supplier so that Israel can get the
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:46.280]  war resources 11 on and that's what he's doing he's talking to the dark
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:52.440]  government the the people that can pull off things like 9-11 for example yeah
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:57.040]  that's what Steve Pachennik says he says that he will destroy Israel and he's
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:03.520]  Jewish if they launch this I just don't want World War three and nobody does
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:08.720]  and the people who are willing to take the risk for their own personal
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:13.280]  agendas are the ones that will give it to us sure we'll take Richard Pearl he
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:17.600]  was in the New York Times that he walked up to a group of reporters good-looking
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:22.520]  reporter women and thought you pick up women when you weigh 400 pounds and have
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:26.520]  giant black circles around your eyes he thought you picked up women saying I
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:30.960]  launch attacks I kill people and they were all creeped out and walked away and
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:36.480]  that was in the news but I mean it's a bunch of creepy wimpy weirdos academics
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:42.680]  who think it's real manly to sit there not an academic he's an Israeli agent no
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:45.680]  I understand that but what I'm saying is well still they're a bunch of effeminate
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:51.560]  academics and I think they're crazy I think they're very dangerous people
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:58.360]  because the only concern is them no other concern really how does Israel think
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:01.840]  they're gonna get out of a war with Russia that's a that's Armageddon well
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:06.680]  you know it's it's not Israel it's the prime minister hey you know he's got a
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:11.280]  lot of opposition from his own military his own intelligence service from the
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:18.320]  opposition party from Herat's the newspaper the question is how does
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:23.640]  somebody so out of tune with the intelligent part of the population get
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:29.000]  in office and why is hot-med energy making statements like you know the
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.320]  state of Israel is gonna be wiped off why is he jumping up and down adding to
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:38.920]  this rhetoric I think just because people are competitive and he gets tired of
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:44.600]  being having Iran unjustly accused and threatened and accused and threatened
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:47.960]  and accused and threatened and so I think he's no no that's it the Iranians
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:51.640]  are just ready for a fight they don't usually start fights but they will look
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:57.120]  at a million of them fought the US proxy Iraq to a standstill they got a lot
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:00.840]  more high-tech weapons now they're gonna they're gonna start a war with Iran
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:03.680]  they're gonna blow stuff up and blame it on Iran and they're gonna try to come a
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:09.880]  rest all of us and this is the takeover doc well I think in many ways it'll
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:14.000]  backfire on them and when they start the war with Iran they'll really have their
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.680]  hands full I don't think they'll get around us now I agree with you I know
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:22.760]  this is hubris this is this is 10 times Hitler going into Russia right you got

[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:02.280]  Aaron Fullen here as the food police shut down food co-ops the Amish and small
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:06.680]  farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but
[01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:10.200]  to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:13.720]  and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:17.240]  and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:20.240]  of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:23.080]  with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being
[01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:27.240]  found across the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:31.600]  Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat kimchi and in India fermented milk
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:34.920]  is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:38.320]  Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:41.720]  legally and privately in their own homes since it's still legal to make these
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:44.960]  foods as long as you can make them yourself for more information check out

[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:34.000]  news their press release just went out last night I was aware of this report a
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:41.280]  few months ago through one of our auxiliary reporters David Knight who
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:45.040]  were very close to getting to move down here to Texas from North Carolina to work
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:49.920]  with us here because he's got decades in TV and news and reporting and he was
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:56.080]  giving us intel on a lawsuit that was going to be coming out and its ATI file
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:55:02.000]  suit to stop illegal EPA human medical experimentation I've got the lawsuit here
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:09.720]  in my little hands we've got a story by a Don up at info wars.com breaking all of
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:13.160]  this down with links to their press release you know about radiating
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:16.600]  thousands of little kids in secret department of energy test you know about
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:20.400]  injecting black men with syphilis and how they admit little kids you know about
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:24.760]  sterilizing the troops you know about all of this stuff that's gone on we've
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:28.520]  had eugenics before in this country people had to wake up to it and say no
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:35.760]  it's been bad before but the federal government who's named in this United
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:39.160]  States Environmental Protection Agency they've been caught doctoring studies
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:43.400]  you name it doing tests you know before giving foster children high levels of
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:48.160]  pesticide and then banned pesticides cooking things well this time well he
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:51.680]  joins us now to just give us the basics I'm going to break 30 minutes coming up
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:55.280]  we appreciate him come on a little bit later apologize for that we got stuck
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:56:01.600]  with Dr. Roberts covering big world news but this is new human testing really
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:06.640]  deadly testing pumping gas into a hospital and not telling people what
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:14.240]  was what was happening and David W. Schneer joins us he's a lawyer George
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:17.280]  Mason University School of Law Environmental Management University
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:21.480]  North Carolina MS Public Health Environmental Science I'm not going to
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:25.640]  go through it all bachelor's degree chemistry math I mean just goes on and
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:30.960]  on he is a heading this group up and exposing something huge so thank you
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:34.680]  for joining us sir we've only got about three minutes for you to break just just
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:38.720]  give us a basic boil down of what you're about to get into in the next hour be
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:43.240]  happy to and thanks so much Alex the Environmental Protection Agency has
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:50.520]  been conducting tests human experiments folks by piping diesel fumes straight out
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:54.480]  of a truck through a pipe they mix it with a little air and then it goes into a
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:58.160]  little chamber we might just call that a gas chamber because that's what they
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:02.960]  call it it's a small room people sit in there for two hours and breathe these
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:08.040]  fumes the question is is this allowed is EPA even authorized to do this and if
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:12.360]  they were did they do it properly well they did not these people didn't know
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:16.800]  the risks they're at and the assistant the administrator of the EPA says that
[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:22.720]  high exposures to these kinds of things don't just make you sick she says they
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:27.760]  cause you to die earlier than you would they cause death so that's the problem
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:32.600]  we're seeing EPA doing and and that's the concern we have that we're trying to
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:37.720]  stop just incredible you know they would tell troops hey it's a we're gonna test
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:41.960]  the flu on you and the nerve gas and it's always hey be part of a test on air
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:46.600]  quality and they pump in gas anybody knows pumping diesel into a room will
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:49.920]  kill people we're about to go to break a minute and a half but tell people where
[01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:55.840]  this happened EPA has a facility on the campus of the University of North
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:58:00.720]  Carolina in Chapel Hill and they is that facility for a number of their air
[01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:05.720]  pollution tests now I want to make it clear this is not the kind of
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:09.240]  experimentation that EPA should be doing but it might be the kind of
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:14.280]  experimentation the National Institutes of Health might do if they had informed
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:19.400]  the people that they did not properly do and no one should have been doing it we
[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:24.000]  know in this country experiments on humans must be very carefully controlled
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.400]  and one thing you do not do is put them at this kind of risk well that's right
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:31.480]  everybody gets up in arms about animals you know the shampoo has a little bunny
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:35.360]  rabbit ears saying wouldn't test on animals what about humans who stands up
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:49.040]  for us you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today for thousands of years
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:52.800]  silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative but not all silver
[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:56.320]  is equal silver soul is an amazing new technology that has been clinically
[01:58:56.320 --> 01:59:00.000]  shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloid or ionic silvers
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.800]  it can destroy thousands of times more pathogens than older silver technology
[01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:07.440]  silver soul resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:11.040]  labs to kill bacteria and viruses enabling it to kill without direct

[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:21.060]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones we're joined by dr. David W
[02:00:21.060 --> 02:00:26.480]  snare is a fiscal conservative small government free market environmentalist
[02:00:26.480 --> 02:00:30.160]  we'll get more into his bio in the next segment and recap everything this is a
[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:36.520]  short segment long segment coming up doc how did you discover that the EPA was
[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:39.680]  doing this because I know there's a whole other area of the story and
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:44.240]  basically they were trying as I've read over the lawsuit but to rig things to
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:48.680]  then restrict cars right so I mean they're doing this testing so they can
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:54.320]  then demonize you know what comes out of a tailpipe period right well one of the
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:58.080]  biggest problems is we have no idea why they're doing the testing they claim
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:02.200]  that they're doing it to try to find out knowledge about air pollution but in
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:08.000]  fact this kind of testing is not authorized by the Congress we learned
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.920]  about this or I learned about it it when a colleague of mine and a fellow
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:15.800]  member of the American Tradition Institute Steve Balloy called me up and
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:19.880]  he said he had been following this issue for a very long time and what was
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:24.840]  amazing to me Alex he talked about what was going on and I just shook my head I
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:29.920]  couldn't believe him because I'd worked for EPA for 33 years this was my life's
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:36.680]  work I spent a lot of time trying to protect protect excuse me protect human
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:39.560]  health and the environment to try to keep people safe and try to do the right
[02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:46.800]  thing and what what Steve was telling me just was unbelievable and then I thought
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:49.680]  well it's all right we do have protections I'll look at the law I'm
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:54.080]  sure there's a way that the law would allow some of this and I did I looked in
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:57.160]  greater depth than I'd ever looked at before with regard to human
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:01.560]  experimentation and the bottom line is Steve was right
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:05.840]  EPA was wrong they're doing something that should never be done should never
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:10.840]  have even started and it's not around the edges we're talking about taking human
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:17.440]  beings and exposing them directly to diesel exhaust coming directly out of a
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:22.320]  diesel truck that you won't believe the pictures and they're available they park
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:29.320]  a truck next to their building directly underneath an intake a little pipe and
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:34.520]  that pipe pipes this diesel exhaust and not just particulate matter but every
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:40.880]  other kind of toxic substances in that exhaust including carbon monoxide into
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:44.680]  the building they mix it with air and then they pipe it into this little bitty
[02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:51.640]  room where a subject it sits for two hours and breeze it and they get
[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:56.600]  exposures that are above the level allowed by EPA for all the rest of us
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:03:03.400]  and what is most disgusting is that they actually EPA actually sought out
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:09.080]  subjects more likely to be harmed by this than the normal person well I mean
[02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:12.480]  by the way we heard about Nazis that would take the exhaust and put it back
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:16.800]  into a truck they'd arrest people put them in and then pipe it back in I mean
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:23.320]  this really does bring up a Holocaust type imagery well it does and I will
[02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:28.040]  say that you know in normal scientific discussion when Abraham brings up Nazis
[02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:33.280]  the discussion ends because people think you're over the edge but the reality
[02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:37.480]  is an EPA and the University of North Carolina in their own statements
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:44.680]  explained that the rules associated with human experimentation begin with an
[02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:49.400]  understanding that this is what the Nazis did and we won't do it again now
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:55.080]  there's some additional backstory here Alex that I think maybe your listeners
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:04:02.560]  be interested in Steve Malloy's uncle was in a concentration camp and because
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:07.560]  he wasn't able-bodied his job was to go around the camp every morning and
[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:13.000]  identify those people who were too sick to work and those people whose names he
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:19.240]  put on a list were executed that day Steve's terribly upset about this kind
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:26.040]  of thing it's in his family to try to to make amends for a terrible choice his

[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:39.680]  experimentation on humans aka Joseph Mengele and you're right in the law it
[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:44.720]  states we don't want to do that we'll be right back to break this down this is a
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:49.920]  big story with the federal government doing this with people that didn't know

[02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:03.640]  farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but
[02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:07.160]  to healthy homecrafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt
[02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:10.720]  and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes
[02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:14.320]  and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid
[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:17.320]  of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history
[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:20.400]  with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found
[02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:24.360]  across the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:28.760]  Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk

[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:43.440]  we're talking about some incredibly hardcore issues right now if you just
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:46.800]  join us until the bottom of the hour then I'm going to get into the incredible
[02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:51.960]  economic news I haven't properly gotten into yet an amazing story up at info
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:59.280]  wars.com you know you're a conspiracy theorist if we'll go over this list and
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:05.120]  more we've also got a new natural news article just out about Bain capital
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:11.120]  helping cover up Monsanto activities so and again they're financing Obama as
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:17.320]  well it just shows how it's bipartisan evil a total culture of corruption and
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:27.000]  we're joined by Dr. David W here on the show today and we're going to be
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:35.760]  discussing some things we're going to be talking to David W. Schner here in just
[02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:40.680]  a moment and I'm here digging out the press release here that I have in the
[02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:46.200]  stack of Dr. Schner they have filed this lawsuit if you're watching at
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:52.600]  prisonplanet.tv you can see it if not just go to info wars.com and you can
[02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:59.240]  see the photos that they took of diesel trucks piping gas into the medical
[02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:05.120]  facility and and not telling the people what was happening to them and this is
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:08.720]  just absolutely amazing the lawsuit is the American Tradition Institute
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:12.560]  Environmental Law Center versus United States Environmental Protection
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:20.320]  Agency and Lisa P. Jackson administrator and David joins us right now
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:24.080]  Dr. Schner let me just read his bio before we get back to him is a physical
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:28.040]  service small government free market environmentalist he worked with 35 years
[02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:31.640]  at the EPA he earned his PhD in environmental management and his
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:34.960]  master's of science at Public Health University in North Carolina Chapel Hill
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:40.880]  and his JD cum laude from George Mason University School of Law he is a member
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:45.520]  of the bar United States Supreme Court US Court of Appeals for the second and
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:49.680]  fourth circuits and the Supreme Court of Virginia he is an adjunct professor at

[02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:57.800]  for Environmental Stewardship at the Thomas Jefferson Institute Virginia's
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:02.880]  premier independent political public policy foundation director of the
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:06.760]  Environmental Law Center of the American Tradition Institute and director of the
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:11.160]  free market and very environmental law clinic that said he's a real expert from
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:18.920]  the law from the environment perspective you see he is you know really perfect to
[02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:21.960]  be able to expose what's happening here so start over you've got the floor I'm
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:26.720]  gonna shut up now a Dr. Schner and and break down how big this story is again
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:33.040]  ATI file suit to stop illegal EPA human medical experimentation we have the photos
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:36.640]  everything of this it's just it's just par for the course but this stuff still
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:41.000]  going on this is what we think of as the old experimentation and exactly where
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:44.640]  this is going because if they get away with this and thank God you discovered
[02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:49.640]  it you and your team then who knows what else is going on and what's coming
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:55.120]  next Dr. Schner well Alex let me just start out by saying that I'm not a
[02:11:55.120 --> 02:12:01.360]  conspiracy theorist I am a skeptic as I'm a scientist but this is not about some
[02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:09.360]  notion that there's an evil force at work what there is is let's put it this way
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:15.160]  EPA has lost its way it is lost its way in many different ways and the EPA of
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:19.520]  today is not the EPA that I knew when I was there and especially in the early
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:23.080]  days when we were trying to help clean up the environment and protect public
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:29.600]  health there comes a point in time however when not enough management not
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:35.880]  enough oversight is being done and that's what happened here indeed the
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:41.160]  whole issue of using even using data from someone else that came from human
[02:12:41.160 --> 02:12:47.000]  experimentation has been a controversial issue that under President Clinton under
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:52.040]  President Bush we didn't do the agency didn't accept that data and didn't use
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:58.240]  it and in time people who had done this kind of experimentation specifically
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:04.560]  folks who made chemicals herbicides and pesticides said that they were willing
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:09.160]  to do the experiments and and allow EPA to use that data to show that their
[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:14.280]  stuff wasn't very dangerous well indeed they did that kind of work indeed the
[02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:17.640]  agency looked at it and said that the work was done properly the people were
[02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:22.920]  informed properly but Congressman Waxman and Senator Boxer look at this and
[02:13:22.920 --> 02:13:27.360]  said this is nuts you can't do this stuff wrote a lengthy report saying this
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:32.520]  is not appropriate but it went to court and the court said look EPA if it
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:37.360]  doesn't want to use it doesn't have to use it but it has to make that decision
[02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:42.320]  through a regulatory action and if you hadn't regulated they're doing what
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:47.160]  they've been doing more recently which is just by fiat deciding to do things
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:52.800]  without following complete processes well one would have thought at that point
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:56.960]  that EPA would have gone ahead and written a regulation but they didn't
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:03.360]  they just ignored it and that sent a message down the road and some of these
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:07.360]  scientists who didn't have anything better to do or who wanted to work in this
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:12.600]  area or who had a brand new shiny facility that they could use to test
[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:20.040]  human beings with took it beyond the line they imposed risks on these subjects
[02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:25.160]  without telling the people that that this stuff can kill that it can cause
[02:14:25.160 --> 02:14:30.800]  cancer that it is according to the administrator of the US EPA the cause of
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:36.920]  one-fourth of all death in the United States and so we look at this and we say
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:44.000]  well look the science on PM 2.5 is a little bit hokey but you don't fix it
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:53.160]  by putting human beings into a gas chamber and piping in diesel fumes just
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:58.400]  to find out how sick they'll get that's not allowed well by the way you know I've
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:03.240]  seen people arrested and put in Pier 57 during the RNC and 04 then we saw it
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:06.280]  happen everywhere else where they will go and get an old facility and then they
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:10.960]  come and run buses the whole time just to make everyone ill I mean to say you
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:15.480]  know not conspiratorial the I mean doc I know you're a smart guy do you know how
[02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:20.000]  many thousands of secret tests have been declassified many of which were lethal
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:25.040]  against foster children you name it just six seven years ago Newark Daily News
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:31.480]  showed where the government and other groups were contracting with CPS to
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:35.440]  deliver seven and eight-year-old children to facilities to have pesticide
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:39.480]  tested on them until death now I know you may not be aware of that I can I could
[02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:44.520]  I can send it to you if you'd like I mean this is this is a long-term deal going
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:47.960]  on in this country I mean I'm sure you heard about black men and syphilis and
[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:50.480]  things like that injecting them or whatever and letting them have it for
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:54.840]  50 years but I mean that this is all just the tip of the iceberg and I would
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:58.920]  imagine that your investigation you know if it spreads out or you're able to
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:03.480]  get any traction with this you're gonna find there's other stuff going on well
[02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:07.880]  certainly the Tuskegee incident down at Tuskegee Institute where black men
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:11.960]  African-American men were exposed to syphilis and then were never treated
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:16.640]  is a is a perfect example of where the US government fell down on its
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:21.720]  responsibilities and the sad part of that was that these men infected their
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:26.080]  wives their children got infected and even when penicillin was available and
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:30.040]  they could have been completely cured that public health service activity went
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:35.600]  on it went on until it was exposed once it was exposed it stopped immediately and
[02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:41.240]  it was on the basis of that that the laws we have today were written but yeah
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:45.520]  well those people were Joseph Mingolas and should have been executed so they
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:50.440]  wouldn't keep doing this stuff I mean my dad's professor you know the head of a
[02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:54.320]  major department at UT because my dad was taught of his class called him and a
[02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:58.800]  few others aside and said by the way were you a genesis so I mean I mean you've
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:02.280]  got a you know you've got a doctorate in science and things you're a lawyer I
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:07.200]  mean you never ran into the you genesis the anti-human crowd when you were at
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:14.280]  the EPA I have to say that my colleagues at EPA my college the University of
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:19.000]  North Carolina if they understood what was actually happening would just abhor
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:23.840]  what was happening and the only people who will defend this will be the
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:28.920]  scientists who say oh it's not really very risky it's okay it's just a minor
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:33.120]  inconvenience you might get a little bit of problem with your asthma and yet
[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:37.880]  you've got the agency's administrator out there saying this stuff kills the
[02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:42.320]  problem we have is a lack of supervising supervision at the agency a lack of
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:46.440]  honesty amongst these scientists and that's where those problems always start
[02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:50.640]  well where's your lawsuit going and what are you hoping to do with this well
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:54.880]  we're in the Eastern District of Virginia and we are going to and we're
[02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:58.800]  there because among other reasons it's called the rocket docket Alex it means
[02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:04.000]  your case goes forward very quickly they adjudicate with speed and we want this
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:08.680]  stopped we intend to file we file the complaint we intend to file a temporary
[02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:14.400]  restraining order motion by this Friday which means a week from this Friday we'll
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:18.960]  be in front of a judge saying we want this stopped immediately until we can
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:24.440]  sort out what's going on then the the things that we're specifically asking
[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:29.880]  for is that this kind of experimentation stop all together that this this never
[02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:35.040]  happened again secondly we want the University of North Carolina whose
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:40.560]  medical institutional review board was responsible for reviewing the protocols
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:45.480]  and the informed consent materials we don't want them to receive any more
[02:18:45.480 --> 02:18:49.240]  money from EPA yeah well those bioethicists need to be fired no kidding
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:57.080]  so so doc let me expand on this then look the only moral human experimentation is
[02:18:57.080 --> 02:19:00.400]  if someone gives full consent that's why the classic thing is scientists test
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:04.960]  stuff on themselves okay that's your business but you know the key here is
[02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:08.000]  what you're saying in the suit and what they admit they were not telling these
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:11.480]  people what was happening so I think they should be criminally charged when
[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:15.320]  all this is vetted and totally proven I mean I mean how about how about the
[02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:18.920]  Tuskegee people and how about the folks that did this how about some jail time
[02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:22.320]  so they don't I mean why does this why does the scientific community always
[02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:27.120]  get away with this well I'll tell you you're getting into something it's
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:31.520]  actually sort of personal to me and it's an interesting story you're here

[02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:03.560]  small farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade
[02:20:03.560 --> 02:20:06.840]  cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like
[02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:10.680]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with
[02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:14.360]  living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police
[02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:17.520]  are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of
[02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:20.760]  history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being
[02:20:20.760 --> 02:20:24.920]  found across the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso
[02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:29.280]  Africans eat fermented porches Koreans eat kimchi and in India fermented milk
[02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:32.560]  is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news South for line
[02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:36.000]  Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods

[02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:08.880]  alright Dr. Schnair 35 year veteran of the EPA joins us he's also a lawyer and
[02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:15.240]  he's suing over secret testing on people they don't tell him what's happening
[02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:19.760]  EPA suit in federal court over illegal human testing that's from EPA human
[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:25.520]  testing.com junk science is also caring at the story is starting to go big we
[02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:30.480]  have our breakdown at info wars.com including photos okay doc the break
[02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:36.000]  interrupted you there I was saying it's time that people be prosecuted when they
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.800]  do Tuskegee type stuff and you said well this is actually near and near to my
[02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:45.200]  heart let me tell you a story start over yeah I'd like to share with you the
[02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:51.080]  fact that some of this testing is important it's valuable when I was
[02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:57.920]  child my family had four kids in it and we had some neighbors down the way a
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:02.120]  young lady but I'm not going to use her name on radio but she was a dear friend
[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:06.240]  she was a little bit older than me and old as my oldest brother she died in an
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:13.640]  iron lung from polio so when my brother who at age six was asked to partake in
[02:25:13.640 --> 02:25:20.240]  the first human experiments using the sock vaccine we jumped at it he did I'm
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:27.080]  very proud of him and out of that came something that put a disease away just
[02:25:27.080 --> 02:25:31.720]  stopped it almost dead in its tracks that's the kind of human testing that
[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:37.880]  makes sense that's good it's well done and about which we can be proud but the
[02:25:37.880 --> 02:25:44.800]  other kind of testing is wrong and that too has some resonance in my family my
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:52.000]  name is David because I was named after and to honor a relative the last male
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:58.160]  who was who died before I was born a guy by the name of David Steiner he died in
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:05.320]  Puchenwald he died 21 days after the camp was liberated because at that point he
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:10.120]  was so starved and so so ill he couldn't recover and when you look at that from a
[02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:16.040]  family perspective you begin to say you know I need to do whatever I can to make
[02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:20.440]  sure the government does the right thing at the right time and that's part of why
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:26.520]  I joined EPA now I will say I have many good friends at EPA and I believe the
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:31.840]  agency especially in its early days was very very important we've solved a lot
[02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:35.880]  of our environmental problems not everyone but almost all of them and we've
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:39.760]  gotten to a point where we're now asking for more and more risk reduction for
[02:26:39.760 --> 02:26:43.360]  less and less benefit at higher and higher costs well sure I just see it as
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:47.440]  a way to power grab and destroy private property rights while ignoring a lot of
[02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:52.080]  real environmental issues out there well there's a lot to your argument and
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:56.920]  there are some that we cared very deeply about we're looking at and we have a
[02:26:56.920 --> 02:27:02.560]  law student Colorado now to stop their unconstitutional renewable energy
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:07.000]  standard because in fact the renewable energy standards make their dirty or
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:11.040]  doesn't make it cleaner and it costs more but how does shutting down our
[02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:16.520]  power plants that are clean even the new ones help when China's building new
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:20.800]  dirty ones I mean it's just insane Austin is shutting down all its coal
[02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:25.520]  power plants our prices are literally exploding and they go but it's for the
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:30.200]  earth I mean it's crazy well that's that's another example of the whole
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:34.040]  climate change issue at which some people in positions of power want to say
[02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:38.640]  that the scientific debates over but the scientific debate is not over and of
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:42.160]  course in Texas you have the problem and you had last winter I hope you don't
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:46.040]  have it again where when the gas lines froze up and they couldn't get natural
[02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:50.400]  gas to the power plants you were without energy that's right they won't let us
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:53.400]  use the coal anymore no it's everywhere and they've got systems that make it
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:59.400]  clean well everybody has to get your story out blockbuster EPA suit in federal
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:03.640]  court for conducting illegal human experiments I know your organization is
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:07.440]  doing a lot of great work doc I'd like to invite you back about the Colorado
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:11.600]  situation in the next few weeks and to give us an update on this we've got a
[02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:15.280]  minute and a half before break anything else you'd like to add I just like to
[02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:19.680]  thank you for letting the issue get out it's this is not a normal conspiracy
[02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:24.700]  kind of thing this is just plain facts to show EPA is out of control and we'd
[02:28:24.700 --> 02:28:28.160]  like to stop that well isn't this the kind of thing you'd try to stop when
[02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:33.040]  you were at the EPA would be people sending in diesel gas on people it's
[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:37.200]  just crazy it is and if I'd known about it then I'd have raised the ruckus the
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:41.000]  likes of which you'd never heard before well what happened if an employer was
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:46.080]  putting people in a place like this I mean they'd go to jail well I would be
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:49.680]  handled in the court system in a completely different way but I assure you
[02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:53.920]  they'd have to justify themselves and a week from Friday EPA is gonna have to
[02:28:53.920 --> 02:28:58.440]  be in court explaining itself to a judge well we want to get an update from you
[02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:02.200]  doctor again scientist and a lawyer quite a combination look forward to

[02:33:03.880 --> 02:33:12.600]  we are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[02:33:12.600 --> 02:33:27.480]  network look it boils down to this there are forces of good and forces of evil
[02:33:27.480 --> 02:33:33.400]  that have operated throughout history and there's always a battle between good
[02:33:33.400 --> 02:33:37.840]  and evil and evil seeks to get control of the high places so that it can
[02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:44.080]  overpower good but good is stronger and I do what I do because I love my family
[02:33:44.080 --> 02:33:46.960]  I love my children and I love your children I want them to have a good
[02:33:46.960 --> 02:33:52.760]  future and you know that's why I can't mind all the racism stuff even though
[02:33:52.760 --> 02:33:58.000]  it's tribal and feels good because I care about everybody's children and it's
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:03.040]  not just because I'm naive or simple that I'm not a hard cold-blooded social
[02:34:03.040 --> 02:34:08.640]  Darwinist is because it's my hard-wiring and it's what my instincts and my gut
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:12.520]  tells me is the right thing to do does that mean that I don't know that there
[02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:16.840]  aren't groups that hate me because of where I live or what color I am yes
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:20.960]  does that mean that I won't oppose some of those groups that collectively get
[02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:25.320]  together to take my liberties no I'll oppose them but I will scientifically
[02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:30.160]  point out that they're under programming and part of the gang they play
[02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:33.760]  nations off against each other the globalist do but the final equation it
[02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:39.320]  is a corporatist eugenicist-based system that is anti-human and that studies how
[02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:45.160]  humans operate and basically cheats and manipulates us against each other and I
[02:34:45.160 --> 02:34:50.160]  don't want to be part of that and so I make the hard decisions even though
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:54.080]  they're not politically correct and speak out against the corruption of the
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:59.200]  New World Order because there's a method to the madness of the globalist it's
[02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:07.440]  cogent at one level but at a deeper level it is insane it is pure death the
[02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:12.120]  course that we're on and if you just joined us I
[02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:18.080]  covered this a little bit with dr. Paul Craig Roberts the last hour it's the
[02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:25.400]  top story at info wars.com and it's chilling it's c-span with senior
[02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:31.320]  economists at the IMF and World Bank saying they need to stage a terror
[02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:38.800]  attack we played the clip and you know need to get nasty and blame it on Iran
[02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:44.000]  to get a war going he says we need to go ahead and just start a big war and they
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:48.720]  think the public's so dumb that once that starts they'll think you're too
[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:52.600]  stupid to even know why it started and they know the prostitute media will not
[02:35:52.600 --> 02:35:56.280]  ever explain what happened and they're talking about something that most
[02:35:56.280 --> 02:36:00.800]  analysts say will be a giant regional war and drive gas up to eight nine ten
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:05.160]  dollars a gallon bankrupt the country and and then a 30-40 percent chance will
[02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:09.520]  start World War three they got the fleets lined up off China they got the
[02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:14.240]  forces massing you've got China threatening the nuke the US Russia
[02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:17.680]  threatening they didn't even do that during the Cold War and meanwhile people
[02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:22.560]  are like hey man you see the referees yeah they the referees you know the
[02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:26.520]  referees aren't doing a good job at the NFL now when you listen to this guy in a
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:33.640]  minute and a half clip it's up at info wars.com and prisonbuddy.com it'd be one
[02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:36.960]  thing if he said this in private and that'd be evil enough with a bunch of
[02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:41.640]  serious criminals but to say it openly knowing most people are in a brain
[02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:47.800]  numbed or brain dead coma induced hypnosis were the public center mass hypnosis
[02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:50.800]  I mean medically that's in mainline medical journals that's in the BBC that's
[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:55.000]  not my opinion I'm not just saying that you've got a giant mass of people under
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:58.760]  hypnosis you got the elite themselves are under their own hypnosis they're
[02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:02.840]  smoking their own dope Dr. Roberts agree with me last hour that's the father
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:07.200]  Reaganomics that's the former editor of the Wall Street Journal agreeing with
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:11.840]  me I remember him on the show seven eight years ago he thought I was in the
[02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:14.880]  way out left field almost stuff and now he's like yes you have to come to him
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:20.040]  forward to find out the truth because it is the truth I've made this my wife to
[02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:24.160]  know what's going on and it's not hard the globalist all bragging public it's
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:27.920]  like this new thing there's hundreds of cases where they write books saying they
[02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:33.280]  stage the attacks I'll never forget we could dig this up lots and can add it I
[02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:37.120]  remember like six years ago there was that big scandal with the top former
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:41.440]  generals were being paid by the Pentagon some of my half a million year to go out
[02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:47.560]  and push police state stuff and wars and even a released a junior reporter that
[02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:51.000]  was in there with them one of their minions of the generals and it's got
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:57.280]  leaked by a whistleblower we played it on air it was in the news they didn't
[02:37:57.280 --> 02:38:04.880]  point out how big a deal it was that it's the five generals former generals in
[02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:07.720]  there with rumsfeld they're like you know 9-11 really helped us sir we need
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:12.320]  another one right now are we gonna have one you can pull this up rumsfeld you
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:16.760]  know talks about new 9-11 with generals he's like I know but it's just hard right
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:22.720]  now it's hard right now I mean they're they're not even one micron of denying
[02:38:22.720 --> 02:38:27.400]  what they're talking about there's just can we please have one of those and
[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:30.560]  rumsfeld's like it's hard right now you know and yeah because people like Alex
[02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:36.840]  Jones and are risking their lives to come out and say it's an inside job and so
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:42.280]  many good old boys are like I was talking to one of these deer hunters this
[02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:45.080]  weekend we weren't deer hunting but he was down there getting a stand and stuff
[02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:51.080]  ready who a year ago he was veteran engineer you're not nice fella you know
[02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:55.760]  smart guy and a year ago he said I know government stage stuff but I just can't
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:39:00.360]  I just don't want to believe it and then I explain it in a globalist run the
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:03.560]  radical Muslims and sometimes they really stage tough sometimes they let
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:06.520]  them do it but now do you understand because they're running al-qaeda and
[02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:14.920]  Libya and Syria and he goes yeah now I understand and then my uncle's talking
[02:39:14.920 --> 02:39:20.440]  about CIA drug dealing in Vietnam and here's this guy who was in Vietnam I'll
[02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:23.880]  just leave it at that in classified areas he's going yep it's all true yep yep
[02:39:23.880 --> 02:39:27.840]  so see it's like once people just admit it yeah okay they did 9-11 yeah the
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:31.240]  government brings the drugs in you know it's like they know they all know they
[02:39:31.240 --> 02:39:36.800]  were there they all know and it's not like it's only a few of them that know
[02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:40.880]  I've got a great uncle you did stuff you wouldn't even believe but well I guess
[02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:45.880]  you would believe it you seen a movie like the package with Gene Hackman stuff
[02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:50.840]  like that in Chicago even in the same city it's like wow I've heard this story
[02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:58.480]  before you know it it's just crazy how wild reality is and at the end of the
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:02.840]  package a listeners kept calling saying I should see a movie I hadn't seen was
[02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:06.880]  made back in the 80s gene Hackman looks at the colonel and says you know what
[02:40:06.880 --> 02:40:12.160]  you're part of a different army than I am and I don't want to get off into it it's
[02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:16.160]  just it's it's it's it's it's just there's good and there's evil folks and
[02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:20.400]  there isn't it's not that the Russians are evil or America's evil or the
[02:40:20.400 --> 02:40:24.280]  Israelis are evil or the Germans are evil or the Iranians are evil there's
[02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:30.440]  corrupt people in charge of all these countries by their very nature they
[02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:33.640]  don't get into power unless they're ruthless and they're competing with all
[02:40:33.640 --> 02:40:40.500]  these other ruthless people so it just becomes it just becomes par for the
[02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:47.280]  course and then groups the globalist are partnering with start kidnaping little
[02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:51.720]  kids not just running running sex slaves not just running you know 18 year old
[02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:55.320]  women which is bad enough now it's little kids and now it's blow their heads
[02:40:55.320 --> 02:40:59.360]  off you know I mean that's in the news that you in and NATO groups get little
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:02.960]  kids rape them and then blow their heads off I mean stuff like that I don't want
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:07.520]  to get into it on air you go look it up I mean you know it's like how far can you
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:11.800]  go all the way to hell that's the thing about evil is all the government deals
[02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:15.160]  the drugs big deal somebody's gonna use it anyways next it's all somebody's
[02:41:15.160 --> 02:41:20.560]  gonna kidnap little kids and torture them blow their heads off so you know the
[02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:24.000]  government might as well control that you know we need to control it so we can
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:29.280]  limit it you know that's always the excuse no the truth is you people are
[02:41:29.280 --> 02:41:34.880]  demons and you're now you're trying to start World War 3 why not I mean you got
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:40.840]  some guy it looks like he's in a $500 suit with wrinkles all over it up there
[02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:44.600]  with a bunch of men giggling going we can start killing people we can stage
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:51.560]  something and start this war right now everybody's like hey let me tell you man
[02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:56.360]  you think it's Soviet or Nazi war rooms even though they were evil they were
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:42:00.200]  sitting around joking no they weren't joking was very serious I mean you guys
[02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:05.240]  are a joke you're gonna even if you were evil you're not you've inherited the
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:08.960]  power structure that Americans built that's become corrupted you didn't
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:14.560]  build this jack and you sure are running it into the ground though
[02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:21.840]  you're running it into the ground no time I've never seen anything more
[02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:28.560]  frightening than this little World Bank operative up there giggling and
[02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:33.000]  snickering and laughing about staging the murder of people to get us into a
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:39.360]  war they'll kill Americans folks and then get us into a war and they think
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:48.000]  they're they're they're so powerful they admit the crimes in public by the way
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:52.000]  we've invited dr. Pachennick back on the show and he has not agreed to come back
[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:55.760]  on yet so that's out there by the way he would have already been on the show
[02:42:55.760 --> 02:43:01.200]  bringing this type of stuff up you know we have the courage to put him on the
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:04.480]  show last week and to just put Paul Craig Roberts on and cover this and
[02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:08.560]  believe me it does take courage because if these people will get up on TV and
[02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:15.480]  talk about staging fake terror attacks folks they'll do anything and as a man
[02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:19.720]  I've got to resist this because these people will blow the face of the earth
[02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:24.640]  off they will make this planet uninhabitable if they get their way and
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:28.280]  see you got to come to that point folks you got to get past what your
[02:43:28.280 --> 02:43:32.320]  neighbors think you got to get past even losing your life because if you're not
[02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:36.680]  willing to give your life up for freedom the tyrants will take over if you
[02:43:36.680 --> 02:43:45.880]  stand down they're going to occupy you got to go at this 110% that doesn't
[02:43:45.880 --> 02:43:50.640]  mean recklessly but you you know you've got to you've got to resist it people
[02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:55.840]  got to choose sides and me I choose I'm against World War three I stand with the
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:43:59.960]  Pentagon who's been blocking this Iran nonsense since Cheney wanted to blow up
[02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:04.320]  our own ships and blaming on Iran and that came out of New Yorker magazine
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:09.080]  why do you think senior White House advisors told Seymour Hirsch Pulitzer
[02:44:09.080 --> 02:44:16.160]  prize one or that because they're trying to stop this the people at the CIA and
[02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:20.840]  the people in the Pentagon there's a fight going on the real government's
[02:44:20.840 --> 02:44:24.440]  trying to stop this from happening and it's not even because most of them are
[02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:30.000]  perfectly moral good guys they understand folks you go shoving the Russians
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.920]  around they'll have a war with you it doesn't matter if they're corrupt and
[02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:40.120]  fallen apart you go start fights with the Chinese that we've totally built up
[02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:43.160]  and again it's like it's like the globalist to put al-Qaeda in charge and
[02:44:43.160 --> 02:44:47.360]  now al-Qaeda is attacking them you put the Chinese Communist in charge give them
[02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:52.640]  the ICBM Merv technology Laurel and Hughes and now the globalist want to
[02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:56.400]  start a fight with them it's insanity
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:08.040]  it totally freaks me out to watch that video because it's it'd be one thing if
[02:45:08.040 --> 02:45:12.040]  it was clandestinely filmed but it was some cold-blooded guy up there saying
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:16.880]  it's a dangerous program but we believe we need to do this and you know it needs
[02:45:16.880 --> 02:45:23.000]  to be staged it'd be bad enough but it's like well just stage something like a
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:28.800]  skexie or something out of the dark crystal it didn't funny people like
[02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:35.760]  that will cause world war three ladies and gentlemen it because it's exciting
[02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:39.040]  to them you know I've learned about criminology so many psychopaths and
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:43.240]  criminals they do wilder and wilder stuff until they get caught they're
[02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:51.840]  crying out to be caught on television they believe their own propaganda I mean
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:59.120]  oh man I tell you before I plug some other news here that's important I want
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:02.760]  to plug the magazine they're going quick last time they sold out in 36 hours if
[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:06.960]  you want the new October issue DARPA the real sky that October surprise war
[02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:10.280]  question mark the end of humanity rise the robots this is an emergency
[02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:14.360]  transmission it blows away the last issue if you subscribe though you can get
[02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:19.200]  the first issue we save some back for subscribers 59.95 that includes shipping
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:24.680]  nobody can beat that deal 13 issues delivered to your door for 59.95 or you
[02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:30.480]  can buy them in bulk at cost 10 for 14.95 and so on international it's a
[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:34.280]  little bit more because of the shipping but again you can sign up at info war
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:42.160]  store.com and again I hope to back off their World War 3 plans you know it
[02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:47.600]  came out that four years ago what former top CIA analyst Ray McGovern told us
[02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:53.280]  indeed was going on that Cheney was trying to stage a terror attack to get
[02:46:53.280 --> 02:46:58.160]  us into war that got backed off we got called sharemongers for saying the war
[02:46:58.160 --> 02:47:03.080]  with Iran is on turned out it was on it was on again last year with the fake
[02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:07.320]  assassination attempts of the Saudi ambassador in New York that turned out
[02:47:07.320 --> 02:47:10.980]  that was fake we're trying to stop it now they've had three chairman of the
[02:47:10.980 --> 02:47:17.760]  joint chiefs two heads of cent com or is it even more resign saying they're being
[02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:22.040]  ordered to launch attacks and then the neocon mouthpieces are like don't listen
[02:47:22.040 --> 02:47:25.400]  to Alex Jones and others there's not going to be a war no you just invaded
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:30.280]  all these countries and are launching proxy wars against Syria Libya Iran
[02:47:30.280 --> 02:47:35.120]  everything else and on TV saying you've already launched proxy wars giggling
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:38.640]  about it oh no there's no danger of a war so we'll just go there's no danger
[02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:43.560]  of a war so we'll just shut up and let them all do it and then if we stop the
[02:47:43.560 --> 02:47:50.120]  war oh see there was no war oh Alex there's no TSA on the streets of America
[02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:54.800]  boom they're all over the streets all big deal we need them Alex there's no
[02:47:54.800 --> 02:48:03.560]  secret experimentation I mean even though there is don't be a fear monger this
[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:06.760]  is what they do to get you to stand down and have learned helplessness and
[02:48:06.760 --> 02:48:17.720]  suspended mass psychosis of mass Stockholm syndrome and normalcy bias and
[02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:22.960]  folks if you don't know what those terms are you better look them up because our
[02:48:22.960 --> 02:48:31.320]  ruling elite are like Hitler turning east to go fight the Russians in 1943 or
[02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:40.000]  Napoleon doing it in 1810 or whatever it was this is not good and it's all
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:44.440]  because these crazy bankers who built an empire on delusion and their
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:50.720]  quadrillions of fake debt they believe they're unstoppable they believe they're
[02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:55.960]  all powerful they but we're repeating history the new old order is so good at
[02:48:55.960 --> 02:49:04.360]  running our lives so good at poisoning our water so good at dumbing us down but
[02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:09.160]  they can't run themselves see that's the thing they're not in control themselves
[02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:12.920]  they're going to destroy themselves and us along with them so I gotta say the
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:16.840]  Pentagon's doing a good job trying to stop all this but there's a fight going
[02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:20.560]  on with a minority of people in the Pentagon that want to start World War
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:24.760]  3 and they got a bunch of so-called Christians who want to get World War
[02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:28.320]  3 going because they think it's gonna make Jesus come back I mean you talk
[02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:33.720]  about Jim Jones stuff writ large you people are out of your minds you think
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:38.480]  you're gonna tie yourselves to a rocket and any jet down here when you start
[02:49:38.480 --> 02:49:42.120]  World War 3 think again I've read the Bible that ain't in there the raptures
[02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:48.880]  after all this happens but your preachers are bought and paid for it
[02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:51.560]  doesn't matter it's like every Christian group every time they're getting
[02:49:51.560 --> 02:49:54.160]  slaughtered the last hundred years they think it's the rapture and they stand
[02:49:54.160 --> 02:49:57.720]  down and just get killed I mean they did it with Hitler they did it with Stalin
[02:49:57.720 --> 02:50:03.320]  they did the Ukrainian Christians did it Christians in Cambodia stood down
[02:50:03.320 --> 02:50:08.520]  thinking it was the rapture and I'm tired of it even if the rapture was coming
[02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:13.200]  you think God's gonna say he knows you if all this evil's going on and you just
[02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:17.320]  hide and fear because you're afraid and just oh praise God things are getting
[02:50:17.320 --> 02:50:22.600]  bad it's the end of the world 2012
[02:50:22.640 --> 02:50:27.760]  talk about evil I mean does your spirit does your gut that's what your gut is
[02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:31.880]  does it tell you that you're gonna be safe just hiding and going to little
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:38.280]  church that tells you now spy on your neighbors Roman 13 it's of the Lord the
[02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:42.200]  government loves us know the government's a bunch of devil worshiping
[02:50:42.200 --> 02:50:47.920]  demons and if you serve this government you're you might as well just swear
[02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:52.480]  allegiance to Satan unless you work within the government to stop what's
[02:50:52.480 --> 02:50:55.600]  happening but if you aid the people running this government you're going to
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:50:59.760]  hell Aaron full in here as the food police shut down food co-ops the Amish
[02:50:59.760 --> 02:51:03.760]  and small farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade
[02:51:03.760 --> 02:51:07.080]  cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like
[02:51:07.080 --> 02:51:10.880]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with
[02:51:10.880 --> 02:51:14.560]  living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police
[02:51:14.560 --> 02:51:17.720]  are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of
[02:51:17.720 --> 02:51:20.960]  history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being
[02:51:20.960 --> 02:51:25.120]  found across the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso
[02:51:25.120 --> 02:51:29.520]  Africans eat fermented porches Koreans eat kimchi and in India fermented milk
[02:51:29.520 --> 02:51:32.800]  is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news South for lion
[02:51:32.800 --> 02:51:36.200]  Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods

[02:56:53.920 --> 02:56:57.920]  mainstream media you're one you like nature you're one you think it's a good
[02:56:57.920 --> 02:57:00.320]  idea to spend Friday night in Thanksgiving with your family rather
[02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:04.640]  than camping outside Best Buy to get cheap plasma television made by slaves
[02:57:04.640 --> 02:57:09.000]  in China you think it's a little strange WTC 7 came down at freefall speed on
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:13.160]  9-11 it was not hit by a plane you think the drones in America might not be for
[02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:16.920]  al-Qaeda you would like to be able to get on a plane without having to engage
[02:57:16.920 --> 02:57:22.560]  in mandatory radiation bath and digital strip surge you have read a book in the
[02:57:22.560 --> 02:57:25.920]  past year you think you have a right to protest you think the war on terror is a
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:30.320]  scam you think the war on drugs is a scam you think that the anger directed
[02:57:30.320 --> 02:57:33.720]  America the Middle East could possibly related to a foreign policy rather than
[02:57:33.720 --> 02:57:37.440]  having how amazingly free we are you think the Republicans and Democrats are
[02:57:37.440 --> 02:57:41.360]  exactly the same on important issues affecting our country you think that
[02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:46.000]  believing in the Constitution does not constitute a terrorist act you have heard
[02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:50.800]  of the Bill of Rights an even name one or some of them you have questioned
[02:57:50.800 --> 02:57:54.600]  whether the government loves you you think the right to bear arms is not for
[02:57:54.600 --> 02:57:57.480]  hunting rather so citizens can fight back to the government become a bunch of
[02:57:57.480 --> 02:58:01.240]  tyrannical thugs and it just goes on from there and Paul Watson added a bunch
[02:58:01.240 --> 02:58:04.760]  of his points to it well Paul and I did this morning so we've expanded on it we
