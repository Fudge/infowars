[01:18.500 --> 01:24.260]  contracted in the third quarter deep in fears of a worldwide recession born of the worst

[02:17.620 --> 02:23.660]  the safe money is that the stock market will settle out at 7500 for the next year or two
[02:23.660 --> 02:27.900]  and then go ahead and then finally plunge down to just a couple thousand points then
[02:27.900 --> 02:33.820]  the elite will go in buy it all up with the banker bailout money that they've been pumping
[02:33.820 --> 02:39.980]  into themselves and freezing liquidity to the rest of the population main street corporations

[02:53.460 --> 03:03.740]  the long telegraph reports demand for gold soars as price tumbles it's very hard to even
[03:03.740 --> 03:11.380]  get a hold of gold and when you can find gold coins and bars it's a huge premium most gold
[03:11.380 --> 03:17.980]  brokers are sold out most silver brokers are sold out mean go around different gold sites
[03:17.980 --> 03:21.620]  different gold companies and a lot of them say sold out for weeks sold out for the last
[03:21.620 --> 03:31.020]  month hoping to get more the mints of the west the u.s. Canada Germany Australia they by law
[03:31.020 --> 03:34.380]  have to buy at its spot you know they're not allowed to pay premiums for what they then
[03:34.380 --> 03:39.820]  turn into bullion so they have to suspend all their contracts last few months and they don't
[03:39.820 --> 03:46.460]  have gold coins for you because the because the imaginary paper number of 750 bucks 800
[03:46.460 --> 03:54.180]  bucks as it goes back and forth this is admitted manipulation admitted manipulation and the
[03:54.180 --> 03:58.140]  people that can get gold are buying it for 900 bucks and when it was 900 a few weeks
[03:58.140 --> 04:03.540]  ago they were getting it for a thousand just total and complete admitted manipulation
[04:03.540 --> 04:08.220]  even the mainstream media is being forced to admit is totally manipulated as people
[04:08.220 --> 04:13.860]  that were in the commodities dump everything they've got liquidation liquidation liquidation
[04:13.860 --> 04:20.620]  liquidation so we have a depression happening in the real economy simultaneously we have
[04:20.620 --> 04:29.500]  hyperinflation overlaying that and so people are liquidating everything so they also can't
[04:29.500 --> 04:33.820]  find gold I mean that's a supply and demand works you can't find it there's huge demand
[04:33.820 --> 04:38.900]  for it explodes in price but in this manipulated system it doesn't work like that but they
[04:38.900 --> 04:45.220]  can't continue this forever this is incredible ladies and gentlemen all right that's just

[08:26.300 --> 08:37.620]  and also add it to the listen live page and I would like to be able to offer more phone
[08:37.620 --> 08:43.980]  lines for people to dial into and listen but all we can afford is 180 by the way that's
[08:43.980 --> 08:50.020]  down at the phone company to be able to do this here in austin texas and we're not made
[08:50.020 --> 08:54.300]  out of money I mean I just take the amounts of money that come in here from the prismplanet.tv
[08:54.300 --> 08:59.500]  members from the advertisers from the video and book sales and we take that we put it
[08:59.500 --> 09:04.340]  right back into the staff right back into better computers better cameras better office
[09:04.340 --> 09:09.860]  we're building two studios right now that's going very well and when it's all done in
[09:09.860 --> 09:15.220]  the next month I'm going to give you a online tour with a video camera I'm going to walk
[09:15.220 --> 09:19.260]  around the office of the new office and show everybody what we've done what we've done
[09:19.260 --> 09:25.100]  with the money bomb money as well this phone line system is not money bomb money but $250,000
[09:25.100 --> 09:30.580]  we raise in one day thanks to a listener coming up with the idea to do it that's going into
[09:30.580 --> 09:35.780]  the studios into the camera upgrades computer upgrades and we know we shopped around we
[09:35.780 --> 09:40.220]  try to do this as inexpensively as possible but still so everything will look really good
[09:40.220 --> 09:46.220]  and sound really good so big upgrades to the sound of the radio show upgrades a TV show
[09:46.220 --> 09:52.300]  and I won't just be doing the once a week TV show that'll be on a dish or the other
[09:52.300 --> 09:56.900]  systems I'm also shopping around some different cable systems and packages we'll also be
[09:56.900 --> 10:04.060]  doing live reports you know in the TV show format for the prismplanet.tv folks and that
[10:04.060 --> 10:09.900]  of course is ripped all over the web which we love it'll be in high quality for the prismplanet.tv
[10:09.900 --> 10:17.140]  members we're working on a lot of things right now trying to up our game in the resistance
[10:17.140 --> 10:24.540]  to the new world order any way we can now why is 180 phone lines important I mean one
[10:24.540 --> 10:32.620]  amour one amour FM affiliate like we have the ratings just from KLBJ590 off the arbitron
[10:32.620 --> 10:38.860]  and just in that two hours listening it's conservatively about 100,000 people that tune
[10:38.860 --> 10:49.060]  in every 15 minutes and it's well over well over 500,000 people that tune in not just
[10:49.060 --> 10:53.060]  with the Austin book but surrounding books were KLBJ from Dallas at San Antonio shows
[10:53.060 --> 10:57.820]  up in the book we're talking about over a half million people that tune in on that one
[10:57.820 --> 11:04.660]  affiliate and we have other affiliates that are in large cities as well so you know you're
[11:04.660 --> 11:09.500]  talking about hundreds and hundreds of thousands of listeners millions total on AM and FM hundreds
[11:09.500 --> 11:14.660]  of thousands conservatively on WWCR the biggest and longest continually operating private
[11:14.660 --> 11:24.300]  global shortwave in the United States 100,000 watts that were on what is it now 11 hours
[11:24.300 --> 11:32.580]  a day live for four hours then it rebroadcast several times that's last time I checked they
[11:32.580 --> 11:41.420]  had us on that much and then the internet number one on shoutcast for radio talk show
[11:41.420 --> 11:46.620]  there's some music that's above us you can go look at their ratings section their stats
[11:46.620 --> 11:50.420]  their raw stats section there and that's not even counting our over 100,000 a day downloading
[11:50.420 --> 11:58.780]  the free podcast at info wars dot com and of course there are the the windows streams
[11:58.780 --> 12:04.380]  we have that about 3000 people are tuned in on any one time on those tens of thousands
[12:04.380 --> 12:09.100]  over the four hours the average time listing on the there's about 45 minutes we've looked
[12:09.100 --> 12:12.980]  we've got all those stats so that you know that builds and then all the other people
[12:12.980 --> 12:16.180]  that are refeeding and streaming and then the people that put it on YouTube I mean it's
[12:16.180 --> 12:21.140]  incalculable put the audio on YouTube and put video to it I'm giving you the listeners
[12:21.140 --> 12:25.740]  a report on just how many people were reaching and the effectiveness of it and how blessed
[12:25.740 --> 12:34.580]  we are to have this platform and how humbled I am and how fast it's growing that said
[12:34.580 --> 12:43.740]  it sounds insignificant to say we've added 100 and 180 phone lines but I've talked to
[12:43.740 --> 12:48.060]  other people on other radio networks and places that have done this that's how radio was born
[12:48.060 --> 12:53.260]  in Europe it was first called radio before Marconi and others invented it radio was
[12:53.260 --> 12:59.220]  for the elite when telephones just became popular turn of the last century and so governments
[12:59.220 --> 13:08.340]  companies corporations and the wealthy would dial in to a newsroom with live newsreaders
[13:08.340 --> 13:15.260]  reading the newspapers from around the world and reading telegraph wires coming in live
[13:15.260 --> 13:19.740]  about what was happening and so that was only for the elite then and then they developed
[13:19.740 --> 13:27.660]  wireless radio but the original term radio was from people who would dial into a central
[13:27.660 --> 13:32.580]  switchboard right when telephones were just being put in in Europe and to some degree
[13:32.580 --> 13:37.820]  in the United States and there were different channels you could dial into to get different
[13:37.820 --> 13:47.180]  news reports but that was completely annihilated by the advent of wireless which of course
[13:47.180 --> 13:59.100]  is great but the 180 lines that is for micro FM's that is for people who don't have a computer
[13:59.100 --> 14:05.020]  that is for well just a lot of people try to call in on the show just to listen if they
[14:05.020 --> 14:10.340]  don't have an hammer FM or shortwave is not coming in good or they don't have a computer
[14:10.340 --> 14:13.900]  and tens of thousands of other people I've talked to that have done this you've just
[14:13.900 --> 14:18.900]  had you know 30 40 lines tens of thousands tune in over a month on it and it's been very
[14:18.900 --> 14:24.900]  very popular and so we hope to be able to pay for this with a sponsor after the first
[14:24.900 --> 14:31.340]  month we can show sponsors look you know 20,000 30,000 whatever it's going to be tune in you
[14:31.340 --> 14:38.580]  know dial in to this line and here's you know a you know basic you know you know how long
[14:38.580 --> 14:46.380]  they listen so we can pay for that and if it works if we can pay for it I'll expand
[14:46.380 --> 14:52.980]  the thing that thousands of lines because there are attempts to regulate and shut down
[14:52.980 --> 14:57.260]  the internet I mean now the British government the German government the Australian government
[14:57.260 --> 15:01.300]  the US government they're now openly announcing they want to restrict and shut down the web
[15:01.300 --> 15:06.460]  and quote give you free taxpayer paid for it's not free national wireless internet that
[15:06.460 --> 15:10.700]  will basically knock out most of their competition but then info wars dot com prison one dot
[15:10.700 --> 15:14.780]  com and thousands of other alternative sites they've stated quote alternative news will
[15:14.780 --> 15:18.580]  not be on there and in Europe and in England where the government is providing a lot of
[15:18.580 --> 15:23.500]  free wireless we are blocked and we've done reports on that and there's a lot of other
[15:23.500 --> 15:28.380]  ways they're censoring we've gone over those different issues in videos and radio shows
[15:28.380 --> 15:33.900]  that we've done but but it's really happening so we have all these different legs in the
[15:33.900 --> 15:38.020]  fight you know picture this operation as a table and we want to be stable we have the
[15:38.020 --> 15:41.900]  aim and fm we have shortwave we have internet we have satellite we have the people that
[15:41.900 --> 15:45.820]  take the radio show and put it on bit torrents and put it on file sharing networks and then
[15:45.820 --> 15:52.300]  post it on youtube and blip tv and and and all these other sites and it's having an
[15:52.300 --> 15:59.100]  incalculable effect it's huge but this is just one more little lag that we just grew
[15:59.100 --> 16:05.140]  today and sat down on the floor and we we intend to beef it up until it's a mighty oak
[16:05.140 --> 16:10.220]  so let me give you the number we're gonna put this in the listen live area on info wars
[16:10.220 --> 16:16.420]  dot com the listen page on prison planet dot com the phone number and again i'm sure it
[16:16.420 --> 16:20.020]  will a lot of they start maxing out and if we're able to fund it i mean i'll keep it
[16:20.020 --> 16:24.580]  even if it i'll keep the hundred eighty lines even we don't get a sponsor and i'll just
[16:24.580 --> 16:32.340]  eat the two thousand dollars a month you know that's that's my mission here but if we get
[16:32.340 --> 16:37.980]  sponsors we will and it starts going to capacity and then over we will be fed up here is the
[16:37.980 --> 16:44.660]  number five one two six four six five thousand five one two six four six five thousand and
[16:44.660 --> 16:50.780]  yes it it can't be toll free i had to know that ted anderson's toll free bill just at
[16:50.780 --> 16:56.420]  genesis just for you to be able to call in toll free some months has been above fifteen
[16:56.420 --> 17:00.700]  thousand dollars and when i found that out a few years ago i said well i'm gonna stop
[17:00.700 --> 17:05.260]  just having people sell a hole for hours we'll only open the phones up at certain times and
[17:05.260 --> 17:09.500]  then take calls and that actually saved head my show gets a lot of the calls thousands
[17:09.500 --> 17:15.460]  of dollars a month i just don't like wasting money was a time about five years ago ted
[17:15.460 --> 17:19.620]  almost had to get rid of the one hundred lines because he couldn't afford it this is expensive
[17:19.620 --> 17:24.020]  to do radio it's expensive to do everything we're doing the technology has made it a little
[17:24.020 --> 17:30.180]  less expensive but um you know we're victims of our own success i got two of my it guys
[17:30.180 --> 17:34.540]  out there right now how much would you say just the hundred thousand a day six days a
[17:34.540 --> 17:38.620]  week downloading the podcast you'd give me a number didn't you tell me it's about four
[17:38.620 --> 17:46.620]  grand a month just for that four yeah four thousand dollars a month again i'm not complaining
[17:46.620 --> 17:55.660]  i'm happy i'm just saying that's where your funds your support goes is to i mean it may
[17:55.660 --> 18:00.940]  be free to everybody out there but it's sure not free for me and it kind of gets scary
[18:00.940 --> 18:05.860]  i'm like this thing is growing well we get in every week now about three or four thousand
[18:05.860 --> 18:09.140]  more people on the podcast and then about our growth rate we had a meeting a couple weeks
[18:09.140 --> 18:13.460]  ago yeah three or four thousand new people a week that sucker in another year is going
[18:13.460 --> 18:20.900]  to be over two hundred thousand a day and then exponential i mean it's a exponential
[18:20.900 --> 18:27.080]  just on the free podcast and we got a pay to send those streams out to uh and shout
[18:27.080 --> 18:33.900]  cast has the status tracking our visible streams only about half of them in fact i'll go while
[18:33.900 --> 18:38.340]  i'm on this i should go pull that up and stats at shout cast but it shows just millions and
[18:38.340 --> 18:44.380]  millions and millions like last time i checked on it was like four million plus and i saw
[18:44.380 --> 18:51.220]  13 million number in there too every month people tuning in just to the streams now granted
[18:51.220 --> 18:53.900]  that's that's a couple million people you know doing it over and over again but the point
[18:53.900 --> 18:59.980]  is the growth curve is straight up so praise god praise god for that and as they say for
[18:59.980 --> 19:05.980]  all you atheists out there there are no atheists in foxholes and i'm in a foxhole baby i need
[19:05.980 --> 19:10.900]  god and i know i need those prayers and i i don't want to say i greedily ask for your
[19:10.900 --> 19:15.660]  prayers but i certainly covet those i know covetedness is not good but i appreciate them
[19:15.660 --> 19:21.900]  and i want them you know there is uh there is more in heaven and earth than what your
[19:21.900 --> 19:29.500]  eyes see was that a hamlet paraphrase there there are more things more things i mean just
[19:29.500 --> 19:35.020]  just look at what science has shown us what we didn't know and i i i just i call on divine
[19:35.020 --> 19:40.660]  providence to shelter us through these waters because the enemy is howling with anger the

[24:05.780 --> 24:09.940]  But just to make the point clear, they're trying to restrict the web, radio, media.
[24:09.940 --> 24:15.780]  And imagine if we got up to a couple thousand people listening just on phone lines, that
[24:15.780 --> 24:21.100]  could be another way for people to record it, make CDs of it, make tapes of it, give it
[24:21.100 --> 24:22.100]  to folks.
[24:22.100 --> 24:28.740]  I mean, that's how the Patriot movement, 20 years ago, 18 years ago, 15 years ago, with
[24:28.740 --> 24:34.740]  fax machines and phone lines, stopped a whole bunch of gun banning legislation, UN takeover
[24:34.740 --> 24:44.020]  legislation, biological diversity legislation to destroy people's private property rights.
[24:44.020 --> 24:48.860]  So we're going back to low tech, while we expand our high tech, we're hitting them on
[24:48.860 --> 24:53.180]  every front, ladies and gentlemen, the number to call, if you've got unlimited long distance,
[24:53.180 --> 25:03.980]  it's free for you, 512-646-5000, 512-646-5000, the new listen line, and we need your help
[25:03.980 --> 25:07.500]  getting the word out to folks that don't have computers and ways to listen because by its
[25:07.500 --> 25:12.580]  very nature, they can't hear right now on the internet, the satellite, they can't hear
[25:12.580 --> 25:16.380]  on the shortwave and have them dial, but that's another way for them to listen.
[25:16.380 --> 25:23.220]  Okay, markets are, again, plunging right now, over 400 points earlier in the day.
[25:23.220 --> 25:30.580]  It is down right now, 300 points and some change, 327 points, it's dropped 27 points
[25:30.580 --> 25:37.020]  in the last 15 minutes, while we've been here talking so on, it's way back down, again,
[25:37.020 --> 25:46.420]  and CNBC asked the question, what is behind the sell-off, panic is turning into despair?
[25:46.420 --> 25:51.380]  What's behind the sell-off, panic is turning into despair after beginning in a panic mode
[25:51.380 --> 25:56.340]  the past few weeks, investors are now wallowing into despair, stock markets tumbled, around
[25:56.340 --> 26:01.540]  the world, Friday, as investors move to liquidate risky positions, mounting evidence of a global
[26:01.540 --> 26:08.940]  recession born of the worst financial crisis in 80 years, kept most markets volatile.
[26:08.940 --> 26:13.420]  And who caused all this, the private, inner group of central banks, the control government
[26:13.420 --> 26:20.660]  policy in the western world, had regulations changed that they openly lobbied for, chief
[26:20.660 --> 26:27.660]  among them, the main lobbyist, Henry Paulson, Goldman Sachs, to change the rules so they
[26:27.660 --> 26:40.660]  could take junk, bad loans, and package them as gold stocks, basically, and they sold them,
[26:40.660 --> 26:45.700]  and then they tell you it has to do with subprime mortgages, it isn't the bad loans, the people
[26:45.700 --> 26:50.300]  of the houses, it's that they sold the securities, and that's only part of it, the credit cards,
[26:50.300 --> 26:55.860]  the business loans, the car loans, the corporate loans, the government loans, and all these
[26:55.860 --> 27:00.900]  counties and cities and water districts and school districts and police unions and fire
[27:00.900 --> 27:07.540]  unions, they took your money and they invested in this, let me explain something, over 60%
[27:07.540 --> 27:16.300]  of the money we pay in taxes is invested in these quasi private water districts, all of
[27:16.300 --> 27:23.260]  them, power districts, and they take your money, and the cities do this, and they invested
[27:23.260 --> 27:30.100]  in the global stock market, they invested in derivatives, they invested in mortgages,
[27:30.100 --> 27:33.900]  and you say, well that's good, that's for my pension fund, no, no, no, that's off pension
[27:33.900 --> 27:39.000]  fund, budget money is put into the pension fund, it's called the comprehensive annual
[27:39.000 --> 27:46.460]  financial report, and what they do since 1947, the Pentagon was one of the first groups to
[27:46.460 --> 27:54.060]  do it, they had tens of trillions in the funds, and now, in the last congressional testimony
[27:54.060 --> 27:58.700]  we saw, over 4 trillion has been sucked out in the last 10 years, and they say, we won't
[27:58.700 --> 28:03.380]  save even where it is, and that's when the market was good, and see now they're just
[28:03.380 --> 28:09.940]  saying all that money's disappearing, oh it's gone, no it's not, I told you two years
[28:09.940 --> 28:15.940]  before Enron imploded that it was a drug running, money laundering offshore front, because
[28:15.940 --> 28:22.380]  we have the sources, Greg Powell said others, that it was an offshore front, that they were
[28:22.380 --> 28:27.340]  taking the investments of the money, and the double and triple charging people for power,
[28:27.340 --> 28:31.340]  and they were taking it out the back door, and putting it into their own private corporations
[28:31.340 --> 28:36.340]  and investments, that these private individuals running it out, and then when they blew out
[28:36.340 --> 28:40.900]  Enron they told the employees, they told the stockholders, they told the pensioners, oh
[28:40.900 --> 28:44.580]  everything's gone, there's no money, sorry your pension's gone, by the way Argentina
[28:44.580 --> 28:48.980]  announced last night, they're raiding the state and government pensions, Argentina's
[28:48.980 --> 28:53.820]  run by the very same bankers, and they're even going after private pensions, that's
[28:53.820 --> 28:59.740]  right, so let me just tell you, go ahead and knock our heads together, cops feel like you're
[28:59.740 --> 29:04.900]  part of the winning team, they're gonna take your mommy, your daddy, and your granny's

[32:44.540 --> 32:50.340]  Yeah they set up the national security state in 1947, the government went underground.
[32:50.340 --> 33:01.460]  Under continuity of government, they started the Chicago 1313 model, because Chicago was
[33:01.460 --> 33:07.580]  mafia run for more than five decades before that, they had already started it back in
[33:07.580 --> 33:19.260]  the 30s, they're modeled, take the city revenue, set up a double set of books, and then conduit
[33:19.260 --> 33:28.700]  the money into a select private, predominantly offshore corporations, and in 1947, they went
[33:28.700 --> 33:38.780]  nationwide with it, and for more than 60 years now, they have been taking your toll road
[33:38.780 --> 33:47.580]  money, your parking ticket money, your local taxes, sales taxes you pay, property taxes,
[33:47.580 --> 33:54.060]  rate income taxes, and they've been taking on average more than 60% of it, the rest went
[33:54.060 --> 33:57.780]  to the budget, and they always showed you the budget and had debates, oh look the budget,
[33:57.780 --> 34:01.820]  we don't have enough, we gotta raise taxes, oh we can't fix the police cars, we can't
[34:01.820 --> 34:08.980]  put new radios in the fire trucks, oh we can't fix potholes, oh we need to have this bond
[34:08.980 --> 34:14.380]  package, oh we need to have a new tax, and they took it and they put it into the corporations,
[34:14.380 --> 34:17.980]  and that's how they got even more power, it wasn't enough for the private group of banks
[34:17.980 --> 34:22.340]  to issue the liquidity and the currency to the treasury they control, the private federal
[34:22.340 --> 34:28.140]  reserve, no no no no, they were gonna take your tax money, I don't know what's giving
[34:28.140 --> 34:32.180]  them greater power, the banking fractional reserve scam, I know that's the root of their
[34:32.180 --> 34:37.020]  power, but the evidence shows that this comprehensive annual financial report business, and don't
[34:37.020 --> 34:47.580]  roll your eyes out there, everything we talk about here is true, everything we discuss
[34:47.580 --> 34:56.620]  on this show is easily verifiable by anyone who wants to look, and do I make mistakes
[34:56.620 --> 35:01.140]  absolutely, but I am attempting to tell the truth, I'm telling the truth as best I know,
[35:01.140 --> 35:07.140]  but here's an example, I did a review Monday or Tuesday of W, and I just kind of wrote
[35:07.140 --> 35:14.100]  a few notes after I saw it at home and hampassedly covered it, and I falsely said that Oliver
[35:14.100 --> 35:17.900]  Stone made Flight 93, I know he didn't make that, I know he made the Towers movie, but
[35:17.900 --> 35:21.900]  the point is that was propaganda too, so that's the kind of mistakes I make on the fly like
[35:21.900 --> 35:26.100]  anybody would talking four hours a day on the radio or more, but the bottom line is we
[35:26.100 --> 35:34.740]  are attempting to tell you the truth, we are here giving you the information, we are here
[35:34.740 --> 35:39.700]  exposing what the new world order is up to, all right, let me just run through the news
[35:39.700 --> 35:43.780]  here, huge stack of important news, and then I'm going to open the phones up, we'll just
[35:43.780 --> 35:54.100]  open them up right now, 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231, we're only like 11 days, 12 days, out from
[35:54.100 --> 36:02.980]  the election, so much happening, so much going on, and look, I know a lot of police and government
[36:02.980 --> 36:08.860]  people are just trying to do their job, trying to help people, but the system itself is corrupt,
[36:08.860 --> 36:13.220]  and I have had over the years a lot of government people particularly laugh at me about things,
[36:13.220 --> 36:15.980]  and you're laughing at your own destruction, so that's why I talked about police licking
[36:15.980 --> 36:20.940]  the boots of the system, all the system destroys their future, and make no mistake, all of
[36:20.940 --> 36:26.740]  us are in this together, that's the point I'm making, we're in this together, and that's
[36:26.740 --> 36:33.780]  why I don't crave physical rioting, combat, fighting the new world order and martial law,
[36:33.780 --> 36:42.140]  I want to stop that, I want to expose it before we get to that.
[36:42.140 --> 36:47.580]  Markets entail spin, again the stock market is down massively right now, stock markets
[36:47.580 --> 36:52.060]  worldwide, stock markets tumbled around the world today as investors moved to liquefy
[36:52.060 --> 36:57.180]  risky positions mounting evidence of a global recession born of the worst financial crisis
[36:57.180 --> 37:03.980]  in 80 years, kept most markets volatile, US stock indexes fell around 4%, though not
[37:03.980 --> 37:08.580]  as much as feared earlier in the day when futures hit their limit down, European stocks
[37:08.580 --> 37:15.300]  tumbled 6.5% and Japan's Nikai plunged 9.6%.
[37:15.300 --> 37:21.140]  The dollar surged the fresh two year peaks versus the basket of currencies as dismal
[37:21.140 --> 37:25.700]  economic data from Europe heightens fear of recession, and let me explain what's happening
[37:25.700 --> 37:36.060]  there, I would love nothing more than to have the dollar actually strengthening, because
[37:36.060 --> 37:45.100]  hyperinflation will destroy our future, it is a harbinger of pain and suffering and
[37:45.100 --> 37:54.300]  poverty, it destroys savings, it destroys people's futures, it destroys families, it
[37:54.300 --> 38:00.940]  destroys institutions, companies, jobs, infrastructure, but what you have here and what the bankers
[38:00.940 --> 38:07.220]  have said they're doing is worldwide they are already controlling the dominant currencies
[38:07.220 --> 38:12.860]  of the planet and they are bringing them down together, that's what why they're saying
[38:12.860 --> 38:17.180]  they want a new global order, that's not me saying it, it's mainstream news, there's
[38:17.180 --> 38:22.700]  like 5 articles as of today or more, they are setting up a global order by a private
[38:22.700 --> 38:33.340]  central group of banks and then they are going to have controlled worldwide inflation, and
[38:33.340 --> 38:40.660]  so the dollar lost over 60% of its value against the euro in the last 8 years, and then it
[38:40.660 --> 38:44.180]  would gain a penny back and then it would lose 2 pennies and it would gain 3 pennies
[38:44.180 --> 38:49.660]  back and lose 5 pennies, back and forth, but overall going straight down, now what started
[38:49.660 --> 39:03.380]  happening 3 weeks ago, British Sterling, the euro zone, the Yen, the Yon, currencies worldwide,
[39:03.380 --> 39:12.700]  the ruble, the Dino, on and on and on, they began to free fall, and so what happened is
[39:12.700 --> 39:17.820]  they plunged and so when you put the two indexes of the dollar next to them because they've
[39:17.820 --> 39:22.380]  dropped in value, they're showing you the dollar quote gaining a few pennies back, but
[39:22.380 --> 39:33.740]  only in an index of other currencies, overall all the currencies are losing purchasing power
[39:33.740 --> 39:47.900]  and fast, that is inflation, that is a currency devaluation, the very bedrock core of inflation,
[39:47.900 --> 39:53.180]  and so despite the fact that we already have hyperinflation, above 15% and growing, mainline
[39:53.180 --> 40:00.740]  analysts say 20 to 30% by next year, definitely by 2010 and a year and a few months, only
[40:00.740 --> 40:12.140]  a year and a few months away from 2010, unbelievable, they are depressing the real economy, shutting
[40:12.140 --> 40:18.060]  off liquidity, credit, the economy is grinding to a halt worldwide, while they go, we're
[40:18.060 --> 40:23.060]  bailing you out, we're bailing you out, we're fixing it, amassing trillions into a selectable
[40:23.060 --> 40:28.820]  global banks, so they'll be flushed with cash as everything implodes, so they can consolidate,
[40:28.820 --> 40:31.380]  and so they can then say, oh we've got to have a global government, global regulation
[40:31.380 --> 40:38.060]  to stop this ever happening again, when they're the ones that did it, it's unbelievable, it
[40:38.060 --> 40:46.140]  is absolutely incredible to see this happening, and so for a time the depression, the massive
[40:46.140 --> 40:55.180]  contraction in the real economy, mainstream, farms, ranches, businesses, restaurants, car
[40:55.180 --> 41:02.300]  dealers, local small factories, that is in free fall, and so the fact that there isn't
[41:02.300 --> 41:07.140]  as much demand will take a little bit of the edge off of the hyperinflation, but only for
[41:07.140 --> 41:15.060]  the next year, maybe even less, I mean milk was 2 bucks, it's 5 bucks, eggs were 30 cents,
[41:15.060 --> 41:21.420]  now they're $3, and you're already seeing that real inflation, but it is just going
[41:21.420 --> 41:32.820]  to intensify and intensify, Chrysler to cut 25% of salary workforce, and I've got a lot
[41:32.820 --> 41:44.700]  of other really serious financial news here, GM intensifies talks of buyout to buy Chrysler
[41:44.700 --> 41:59.260]  car operations, US home sales rise 5.5%, Treasuries par gains a stock sell off ease, dollar yen
[41:59.260 --> 42:06.980]  rally on global stock sell off, oil below $65 a barrel, OPEC cut fails to halt slide,
[42:06.980 --> 42:15.740]  some need to sell and get out of the way, GE to test feds commercial paper funding
[42:15.740 --> 42:24.060]  facility, so they're behaving as a financial institution, now a bank, Cumberland advisors
[42:24.060 --> 42:29.540]  are saying that they believe this is a peak of liquidation we've reached, they said that
[42:29.540 --> 42:36.460]  a month ago, they said that six months ago, they said that a year ago, and now you have
[42:36.460 --> 42:42.340]  the helter skelter upside down world of gold and silver demand at record highs, it's sold
[42:42.340 --> 42:47.980]  out in the majority of the nations of the world, mints can't even get it to make new
[42:47.980 --> 42:54.140]  coins shutting down everywhere, they're talking about shutting down for years, but in paper
[42:54.140 --> 43:04.580]  golds plunging, total manipulation, in the election, the IBD editorials has done a report
[43:04.580 --> 43:15.460]  on the most accurate poll from the 2004 election, and that more accurate poll, IBD slash TIP
[43:15.460 --> 43:29.220]  tracking poll with 11 days left, finds a 44.8 for Barack Obama and John McCain at 43.7,
[43:29.220 --> 43:35.980]  so we're talking about a 1.1 point lead for Barack Obama, with the polling agency that
[43:35.980 --> 43:40.900]  was the most accurate in the last election, but because of all the election fraud, don't
[43:40.900 --> 43:44.620]  confuse that with voter fraud, that goes on too, but that's a smaller problem, according
[43:44.620 --> 43:51.220]  to all the experts we've talked to in historically, that's retail, it's more sporadic, stealing
[43:51.220 --> 43:55.540]  it centralized in the machines, that's the key, the media's got you all focused on acorn,
[43:55.540 --> 43:59.020]  which I think is important to look at them, obviously it's fraud and a lot of chicanery
[43:59.020 --> 44:05.620]  and sculduggery and sneakiness going on there, but look at this hand, don't look at that
[44:05.620 --> 44:15.140]  hand while I actually smack you with it, in the Northeast, Obama's got 51% to McCain's
[44:15.140 --> 44:23.700]  33, in the Midwest, it's 45 for Obama, so in the Northeast, Obama's got a huge lead
[44:23.700 --> 44:33.380]  of 51 to 33, in the Midwest, he's 45 to 41 leading, so he's winning in the Midwest, Obama
[44:33.380 --> 44:42.900]  is, in the South, he's losing, in the South Obama gets 40%, and McCain is 51, in the West
[44:42.900 --> 44:56.380]  it's 47 Obama, 44 McCain, Urban is 61% Obama, 28% McCain, Suburban is 31% Obama, 57% McCain,
[44:56.380 --> 45:00.980]  so opposite numbers, basically you can superimpose them, you can switch them, Urban versus Suburban,
[45:00.980 --> 45:21.820]  and rural, 31% are for Obama, 57% for McCain, people 18 to 24, 24% for Obama, 74%, wow, the
[45:21.820 --> 45:30.740]  young people don't like Obama, 24%, I mean 22% for Obama, 74% for McCain, 25 to 44,
[45:30.740 --> 45:42.660]  the trendies, 47% for Obama, 45 for McCain, very interesting numbers here, 45 to 64, 49%
[45:42.660 --> 45:52.860]  for Obama, so 45 to 64, they like Obama, that's the hippies, 49% for Obama, 36% for McCain,
[45:52.860 --> 46:04.340]  and males, 41% Obama, 49% McCain, in parents, 45% Obama, 42% McCain, under 30s, 48% Obama,
[46:04.340 --> 46:17.220]  42% McCain, Democrats, 84% for Obama, 8% for McCain, Republicans, 5% or 4, Obama, 86%
[46:17.220 --> 46:24.820]  for McCain, so stronger partisanship there by 2 points, independent or other, 44% of
[46:24.820 --> 46:31.500]  they had to choose, that's a key swing vote right there if you can trust the election,
[46:31.500 --> 46:46.540]  44% for Obama, 5% above, 5% lead in independence, above McCain at 39%, investors, 43%, self-described
[46:46.540 --> 46:58.060]  investors, 43% for McCain, 43% for Obama, 46% for McCain, some investors favor McCain
[46:58.060 --> 47:06.380]  by 3 points, single women, 55% for Obama, 30% for McCain, married women, 45% for Obama,
[47:06.380 --> 47:15.780]  44% for McCain, high schoolers, 45% Obama, 40% McCain, some college, community college,
[47:15.780 --> 47:24.620]  39% for Obama, 51% for McCain, college degree, 47% for Obama, 41% for McCain, conservative,
[47:24.620 --> 47:31.820]  21% for Obama, 69% for McCain, moderate, 57% for Obama, 29% for McCain, liberal, 87%
[47:31.820 --> 47:38.620]  for Obama, 7% for McCain, upper middle income, 52% for Obama, 38% for McCain, middle class,
[47:38.620 --> 47:45.460]  43% for Obama, 48% for McCain, working people, self-described working, 44% for Obama, 41%
[47:45.460 --> 47:53.100]  for McCain, lower income, 63% for Obama, 26% for McCain, Protestant, 38% for Obama,
[47:53.100 --> 47:58.980]  51% for McCain, Catholic, 39% for Obama, 48% for McCain, other Christian groups, 40%
[47:58.980 --> 48:09.660]  for Obama, 49% for McCain, Jewish, 57% for Obama, 17% for McCain, interesting independent
[48:09.660 --> 48:13.620]  number on that, this is the highest level I've seen for independence, 27% of Jews say
[48:13.620 --> 48:17.500]  they're independent, that's the largest group here I see of any group, I've been ignoring
[48:17.500 --> 48:26.100]  independent, but Jewish, 57% for Obama, 70% for McCain, 25% independent, a lot of that's
[48:26.100 --> 48:37.540]  nader, other 55% for Obama, 36% for McCain, and atheist or none, agnostics, 77% for Obama,
[48:37.540 --> 48:46.140]  14% for McCain, 10% independence, union household, 59% for Obama, 29% for McCain, non-union,
[48:46.140 --> 48:57.220]  43% for Obama, 46% for McCain, displays flag, 36% for Obama, 51% for McCain, does not display
[48:57.220 --> 49:05.140]  flag, 63% for Obama, 28% for McCain, it goes on and on, that's up on info wars.com, kind
[49:05.140 --> 49:09.900]  of mindless, but it's interesting to go over it, we haven't been getting into the campaign
[49:09.900 --> 49:14.100]  as much, but we're down here in the last stretch, so we're gearing up to chronicle all the election
[49:14.100 --> 49:19.700]  fraud that's going on, you'll be able to hear that here, as we talk about election integrity.
[49:19.700 --> 49:22.500]  Speaking of that, I've been watching more TV than I normally do, just tracking their
[49:22.500 --> 49:30.720]  propaganda, and on MSNBC, CNBC, CNN Fox, it's tracking election integrity, keeping elections
[49:30.720 --> 49:31.980]  fair and safe.
[49:31.980 --> 49:36.300]  Now, call us if you know of any election fraud, they did that last election and they basically
[49:36.300 --> 49:38.820]  whitewashing it, let's them know what to cover up.
[49:38.820 --> 49:46.500]  It is the mainstream media, CBS, NBC, Fox, CNN, AP, they're going back to 63 when the
[49:46.500 --> 49:50.380]  globalists killed Kennedy, they then took over elections and the states and counties
[49:50.380 --> 49:55.940]  would announce one thing, but in New York, voter news services would announce the fraudulent
[49:55.940 --> 50:02.500]  numbers, and you go back to every election, there's evidence of massive fraud by V&S.
[50:02.500 --> 50:09.940]  And so to have them, quote, watching it, that is the Fox guarding the proverbial in-house.
[50:09.940 --> 50:18.820]  Democrat Bingman tells station he will reimpose the fairness doctrine to shut down free speech.
[50:18.820 --> 50:22.020]  Principal censor, 9-11 Truth, your book photo.
[50:22.020 --> 50:26.740]  President Nelson, Jesse Ventura to host anti-war pro-piece event, that's up on info wars.com.

[51:30.780 --> 51:35.980]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[51:35.980 --> 51:37.500]  against this country.
[51:37.500 --> 51:41.220]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[51:41.220 --> 51:42.220]  Bin Laden.
[51:42.220 --> 51:43.220]  This is his MO.
[51:43.220 --> 51:46.700]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[51:46.700 --> 51:50.900]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[51:50.900 --> 51:54.060]  intelligence networks inside the United States.
[51:54.060 --> 51:58.540]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[51:58.540 --> 52:00.700]  in and on the U.S.
[52:00.700 --> 52:04.420]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[52:04.420 --> 52:09.860]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[52:09.860 --> 52:13.660]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and
[52:13.660 --> 52:14.780]  much, much more.

[52:34.740 --> 52:35.980]  or worse.
[52:35.980 --> 52:39.380]  With your child going to college or moving out on their own, it's important to keep

[53:43.500 --> 54:10.500]  I'm going to get more into elections later.
[54:10.500 --> 54:11.500]  I want to go to your calls.
[54:11.500 --> 54:19.660]  Here in just a few minutes, international Iranian TV wants me on for an hour.
[54:19.660 --> 54:20.660]  Coming up in about an hour and a half.
[54:20.660 --> 54:21.660]  I just can't do it.
[54:21.660 --> 54:23.660]  The radio show comes first, but that does reach millions of people.
[54:23.660 --> 54:28.700]  They want to do a phone or, though, not a satellite TV interview.
[54:28.700 --> 54:31.100]  Maybe we could simulcast that.
[54:31.100 --> 54:37.140]  Maybe I could dial them here and move one of the guests and then just skip all the breaks.
[54:37.140 --> 54:40.740]  I mean, the network would play the breaks and just cut over me.
[54:40.740 --> 54:45.620]  And we could do, you know, that actually sounds interesting.
[54:45.620 --> 54:49.300]  We go drag Tray in here for me, because we just told them no.
[54:49.300 --> 54:53.900]  Maybe we should tell them yes, because that would make for really informative, interesting
[54:53.900 --> 54:54.900]  radio.
[54:54.900 --> 54:58.940]  I just don't know if they want to do that.
[54:58.940 --> 55:04.340]  The way to pose it to them is Alex will be doing his live radio show and you can just
[55:04.340 --> 55:06.740]  interview him while he's on the radio.
[55:06.740 --> 55:12.580]  You want to tell them that I'd be happy to explain them that I'm on the air, but a lot
[55:12.580 --> 55:13.580]  of times we do simulcast.
[55:13.580 --> 55:17.900]  I'm explaining I'm on the radio, you know, I'm sure they know that Fox and CNN and all
[55:17.900 --> 55:20.580]  them do that, too, where they cut to radio host.
[55:20.580 --> 55:25.460]  And I can tell them I have breaks, but I can just go on the phone system here, except that
[55:25.460 --> 55:26.460]  we're using the phone system.
[55:26.460 --> 55:29.500]  Well, you can do it over the computer, can't you, in there?
[55:29.500 --> 55:32.220]  Have them call that computer system in there instead.
[55:32.220 --> 55:36.700]  And then just make sure we have the backup number in case that computer system drops sometimes.
[55:36.700 --> 55:40.300]  And I mean, because if it's posed as, oh, we'll simulcast, they may have to go to higher
[55:40.300 --> 55:41.300]  places to explain.
[55:41.300 --> 55:46.020]  Alex is doing his show, but, you know, he does a lot of simulcasts where it would be
[55:46.020 --> 55:48.220]  Alex on air being interviewed by your guys.
[55:48.220 --> 55:51.300]  And then, and then we would just pause and listen to what you have to say.
[55:51.300 --> 55:53.820]  We can kill two birds with one stone if they don't want to do it.
[55:53.820 --> 55:56.180]  Just tell them I'm always available after three.
[55:56.180 --> 56:01.780]  And then we've nailed down my coverage on Russian TV coming up on election day, right?
[56:01.780 --> 56:05.100]  That's nailed down now.
[56:05.100 --> 56:06.100]  Triple confirm.
[56:06.100 --> 56:09.180]  Okay, fantastic.
[56:09.180 --> 56:10.180]  We just have to multitask.
[56:10.180 --> 56:11.860]  We do everything right here on the air.
[56:11.860 --> 56:14.460]  It's total transparency, ladies and gentlemen.
[56:14.460 --> 56:19.180]  I thought about doing reality TV with just live webcams here in the office at all times.
[56:19.180 --> 56:21.540]  I bet that'd be crazy.
[56:21.540 --> 56:28.060]  Oh, help me, Lord, oh, democracy don't rule the world.
[56:28.060 --> 56:31.700]  You better get that through your head.
[56:31.700 --> 56:38.540]  This world is ruled by violence, but I bet that goes better than I said.
[56:38.540 --> 56:39.540]  But you're that, isn't it?
[56:39.540 --> 56:41.340]  I'm the king of that.
[56:41.340 --> 56:42.340]  Okay.
[56:42.340 --> 56:46.460]  Here's all the other craziness I have in front of me.
[56:46.460 --> 56:49.500]  We're going to get to this after I take a bunch of calls.
[56:49.500 --> 56:53.060]  Pentagon warns of, kind of Freudian slip there.
[56:53.060 --> 56:58.620]  See, I'm trying to warn you, Pentagon wants a pack of robots to detect non-cooperative
[56:58.620 --> 56:59.620]  humans.
[56:59.620 --> 57:00.620]  That's a quote.
[57:00.620 --> 57:09.620]  And they've got all these big bids out for surveillance robots on all terrain to basically
[57:09.620 --> 57:13.100]  go in and surveil the public, and they also have weapon systems.
[57:13.100 --> 57:17.900]  They use them in a laboratory test, live-action laboratory in Fallujah, swords going around
[57:17.900 --> 57:18.900]  killing people.
[57:18.900 --> 57:23.140]  Every time I talk about this, people take YouTube clips and make fun of me and say,
[57:23.140 --> 57:24.820]  look, he's making up combat robots.
[57:24.820 --> 57:25.820]  Now he's insane.
[57:25.820 --> 57:27.820]  Look, I'm just covering mainstream news here.
[57:27.820 --> 57:33.540]  I mean, you're sickening denial, some of you out there, has just reached biblical proportions.
[57:33.540 --> 57:37.180]  And then people are on my comment page where Steve Watson wrote the story, but it's posted
[57:37.180 --> 57:41.980]  up on prisonplanet.com and infoworks.com, and the comments are like, look at those wimpy
[57:41.980 --> 57:42.980]  things.
[57:42.980 --> 57:44.980]  There's the hide below them away.
[57:44.980 --> 57:47.380]  I don't care if they've deployed these.
[57:47.380 --> 57:52.260]  Yeah, people laughed at biplanes too in World War I until they saw what they could do.
[57:52.260 --> 57:57.060]  The point is they're developing this, and it's developing very fast, and they're admitting
[57:57.060 --> 58:00.340]  they're going to be deployed against the American people.
[58:00.340 --> 58:05.540]  And then they can be given central orders and will carry out crimes, whereas troops may
[58:05.540 --> 58:06.540]  not do that.
[58:06.540 --> 58:13.300]  You see, they face scan you, and then they kill your daughter in a hammer.
[58:13.300 --> 58:21.980]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCN Live.com today.
[58:21.980 --> 58:27.740]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Grounds Hero,
[58:27.740 --> 58:31.140]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[58:31.140 --> 58:36.420]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[58:36.420 --> 58:37.980]  to tell their story.
[58:37.980 --> 58:46.980]  Whitman, EPA director on the AG, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[58:46.980 --> 58:51.740]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[58:51.740 --> 58:53.980]  take action against their global masters.
[58:53.980 --> 58:57.180]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[58:57.180 --> 59:03.020]  He takes his hand off, and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[59:03.020 --> 59:06.500]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[59:06.500 --> 59:12.340]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide, or order
[59:12.340 --> 59:14.980]  the DVD at infowars.com.
[59:14.980 --> 59:18.660]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[59:18.660 --> 59:24.260]  and bring in martial law.
[59:24.260 --> 59:35.900]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:35.900 --> 59:40.700]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[59:40.700 --> 59:41.700]  You want answers?
[59:41.700 --> 59:43.700]  Well, so does he.
[59:43.700 --> 59:52.220]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[59:52.220 --> 59:57.140]  Tray's finding out if they want to do it, international, Iranian TV.
[59:57.140 --> 1:00:01.460]  It's on worldwide, want to be on in an hour, and I told them I couldn't do it.
[1:00:01.460 --> 1:00:05.580]  But I'll do a simulcast with them, but Tray, you know what, I don't think I made it clear
[1:00:05.580 --> 1:00:06.580]  to Tray.
[1:00:06.580 --> 1:00:07.580]  We come in here.
[1:00:07.580 --> 1:00:10.540]  You need to explain to him that I'll be interviewed by him.
[1:00:10.540 --> 1:00:11.540]  I'll give them the floor.
[1:00:11.540 --> 1:00:15.020]  Just explain, the interview will be simulcast on my radio show.
[1:00:15.020 --> 1:00:16.860]  That's the way to put it, and then they'll want to do it.
[1:00:16.860 --> 1:00:18.820]  If it's put, it'll be some two-way interview.
[1:00:18.820 --> 1:00:23.540]  They're not going to do it, because it's their big nightly news program over there.
[1:00:23.540 --> 1:00:26.900]  Oh, I'll just figure it out there on the break.
[1:00:26.900 --> 1:00:27.900]  It doesn't matter.
[1:00:27.900 --> 1:00:29.540]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[1:00:29.540 --> 1:00:34.540]  I've got Pentagon once, a pack of robots that detect non-cooperative humans.
[1:00:34.540 --> 1:00:38.820]  U.S. military chief says NATO to defend Baltics in any military attack.
[1:00:38.820 --> 1:00:43.180]  So that means the globalists will have Baltic states attack the Russians, and the Russians
[1:00:43.180 --> 1:00:44.180]  defend themselves.
[1:00:44.180 --> 1:00:46.940]  NATO's going to attack them, and that's their public policy already.
[1:00:46.940 --> 1:00:55.580]  But that's from Voice of America News, right from Banker Sam himself, right from the foreign
[1:00:55.580 --> 1:00:58.420]  offshore banks that own us to the military and run us to the military.
[1:00:58.420 --> 1:01:02.780]  Also, there's a story Obama's use of hidden hypnosis techniques in his speeches, and people
[1:01:02.780 --> 1:01:08.780]  are in here making fun of it on infowars.com, saying there's no such thing.
[1:01:08.780 --> 1:01:17.740]  Corporate chiefs and high-level politicians are sent to seminars to learn different NLP
[1:01:17.740 --> 1:01:18.740]  techniques and things.
[1:01:18.740 --> 1:01:21.700]  And they have TV shows in the U.S. and England about this.
[1:01:21.700 --> 1:01:26.180]  It really works on the weak-minded, because the public's already been hypnotized by television,
[1:01:26.180 --> 1:01:28.220]  it's already been trained through media.
[1:01:28.220 --> 1:01:29.220]  And there's more and more of this.
[1:01:29.220 --> 1:01:38.700]  I mean, I know they're doing NLP now on Fox News, because TV's much more hypnotizing
[1:01:38.700 --> 1:01:39.700]  than it was for years.
[1:01:39.700 --> 1:01:45.860]  Even with myself, I mean, I have to consciously fight with the info-babes smiling and giving
[1:01:45.860 --> 1:01:50.180]  all the mammalian responses of sexual desire with all the flashing TV screens behind them
[1:01:50.180 --> 1:01:54.500]  and the subliminals and the strobing.
[1:01:54.500 --> 1:01:58.620]  By the way, on BBC now, they announced at the start of programs that admit this program
[1:01:58.620 --> 1:02:00.660]  has subliminals and strobing.
[1:02:00.660 --> 1:02:05.420]  This program has strobing, this program, they would admit it over there and let you know,
[1:02:05.420 --> 1:02:09.540]  because they got some laws passed, but not here, and you try to tell the public that
[1:02:09.540 --> 1:02:16.420]  an example was last fall, my uncle was in town, and he's not a big TV head, he wanted
[1:02:16.420 --> 1:02:24.620]  to watch College Bowl, so we were watching College Football, and I kept saying, don't
[1:02:24.620 --> 1:02:25.620]  you see that subliminal?
[1:02:25.620 --> 1:02:32.100]  That's not even subliminal, it's up there for third of a second, it's up there for about
[1:02:32.100 --> 1:02:33.100]  almost half a second.
[1:02:33.100 --> 1:02:38.100]  I said, no, I don't see it, for like an hour, I'm going, watch, every time they cut back
[1:02:38.100 --> 1:02:41.700]  from a commercial, two seconds later, they flash up that Miller Light ad, and they flash
[1:02:41.700 --> 1:02:42.700]  up the Chevy ad.
[1:02:42.700 --> 1:02:46.380]  He's like, I don't see it, I said, stay conscious, stay conscious, and I had to time it out,
[1:02:46.380 --> 1:02:51.340]  I go, it's coming up every two or three minutes on average, and then we timed out exactly
[1:02:51.340 --> 1:02:55.260]  how many minutes it was coming up, I forget, I think it was like four minutes or something,
[1:02:55.260 --> 1:02:59.220]  and I said, okay, here it comes, stay conscious, stay conscious, focus, focus, and he went,
[1:02:59.220 --> 1:03:03.020]  oh my God, oh my God, there it was, I read it, and I was like, yes.
[1:03:03.020 --> 1:03:06.420]  I mean, they've got it so bad now that the subliminals are even more obvious.
[1:03:06.420 --> 1:03:10.020]  And he said, that's it, I'm not watching any TV anymore, and he hadn't watched football
[1:03:10.020 --> 1:03:11.020]  since.
[1:03:11.020 --> 1:03:17.940]  I mean, folks, you're just being bombarded, you're being bombarded, attacked, constantly,
[1:03:17.940 --> 1:03:21.980]  and I mean, please understand it's taught in college now, please understand it's taught
[1:03:21.980 --> 1:03:24.340]  in high level marketing.
[1:03:24.340 --> 1:03:28.420]  I mean, your local station, your mom and pop, they're not doing it, but the big nationals
[1:03:28.420 --> 1:03:34.980]  are, and it is everywhere, and knowing is half the battle.
[1:03:34.980 --> 1:03:38.300]  But I've been following the financial stuff a lot more than most mornings, I jog on the
[1:03:38.300 --> 1:03:41.940]  treadmill for 30 minutes to an hour, and I've been watching it.
[1:03:41.940 --> 1:03:47.740]  And if you watch the mannerisms, especially on those Fox Morning shows, we'll cut from
[1:03:47.740 --> 1:03:55.420]  the girl to the guy, and the guy is showing all of the mammalian classic psychological
[1:03:55.420 --> 1:04:01.940]  traits of sexual desire for women, being cute, blanking their eyes, being funny, smiling,
[1:04:01.940 --> 1:04:06.380]  blushing, come back to the girl, they're, oh, they'll be talking about playing crashes
[1:04:06.380 --> 1:04:13.660]  or anything horrible, but it's still, oh, oh, oh, oh, she's there to get the men enticed,
[1:04:13.660 --> 1:04:17.900]  he's there to get the women enticed, and meanwhile, there's all the other subliminals
[1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:23.820]  and flashing and screens to shut your thinking process off, scrolls on the bottom, the blue
[1:04:23.820 --> 1:04:31.100]  mist, and I will catch myself literally smiling back at them, literally going under their
[1:04:31.100 --> 1:04:32.100]  control.
[1:04:32.100 --> 1:04:35.540]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.
[1:04:35.540 --> 1:04:39.580]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that
[1:04:39.580 --> 1:04:43.140]  the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[1:04:43.140 --> 1:04:47.300]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for

[1:05:19.380 --> 1:05:20.380]  life.
[1:05:20.380 --> 1:05:24.140]  An incredible food source should be a staple part of your diet every day.
[1:05:24.140 --> 1:05:30.380]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at HempUSA.org today.
[1:05:30.380 --> 1:05:36.660]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:05:36.660 --> 1:05:38.180]  against this country.
[1:05:38.180 --> 1:05:40.380]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[1:05:40.380 --> 1:05:42.380]  But who is the enemy?
[1:05:42.380 --> 1:05:43.380]  Bin Laden.
[1:05:43.380 --> 1:05:44.380]  This is his MO.
[1:05:44.380 --> 1:05:45.380]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:05:45.380 --> 1:05:47.380]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:05:47.380 --> 1:05:52.180]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:05:52.180 --> 1:05:54.780]  networks inside the United States.
[1:05:54.780 --> 1:05:58.660]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in
[1:05:58.660 --> 1:06:01.380]  spying in and on the U.S.
[1:06:01.380 --> 1:06:05.060]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:06:05.060 --> 1:06:10.540]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:06:10.540 --> 1:06:14.700]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[1:06:14.700 --> 1:06:15.700]  much more.
[1:06:15.700 --> 1:06:16.700]  Fabled Enemies.
[1:06:16.700 --> 1:06:21.860]  Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other
[1:06:21.860 --> 1:06:23.860]  titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:06:23.860 --> 1:06:31.340]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[1:06:31.340 --> 1:06:36.420]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generators starting
[1:06:36.420 --> 1:06:38.420]  at $299.
[1:06:38.420 --> 1:06:43.220]  Ionic Zone shock treatment ozone generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners
[1:06:43.220 --> 1:06:48.500]  alike to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, molds, viruses, and complete
[1:06:48.500 --> 1:06:50.180]  removal of secondhand smoke.
[1:06:50.180 --> 1:06:55.140]  Padotors, you name it, what else can three oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone do?
[1:06:55.140 --> 1:06:59.860]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[1:06:59.860 --> 1:07:01.860]  And have you ever heard of ozone therapy?
[1:07:01.860 --> 1:07:05.700]  Ionic Zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy.
[1:07:05.700 --> 1:07:10.100]  Ozone therapy is used, among other things, to raise the body's oxygen level, which studies
[1:07:10.100 --> 1:07:12.300]  suggest boosts the immune system.
[1:07:12.300 --> 1:07:18.500]  You can learn more about ozone therapy or Ionic Zone ozone generators by going to IonicZone.com
[1:07:18.500 --> 1:07:32.700]  or calling 800-549-9535, that's I-O-N-I-C-Zone.com or toll free 800-549-9535 Ionic Zone.
[1:07:32.700 --> 1:07:42.700]  To ease the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:07:42.700 --> 1:07:55.460]  All right, we're going to straighten your calls right now, then I'm going to get into
[1:07:55.460 --> 1:07:57.980]  all this other news.
[1:07:57.980 --> 1:08:03.620]  Like Argentina to raid pension funds in desperate search for cash, they just hate it, but the
[1:08:03.620 --> 1:08:09.140]  army is standing by, just like they're here in America, we're taking your pensions with
[1:08:09.140 --> 1:08:14.180]  the government, everything's all right and you're like, ah, it's a third-world country.
[1:08:14.180 --> 1:08:17.580]  Argentina was wealthier than the United States in the last 100 years.
[1:08:17.580 --> 1:08:22.660]  It was at U.S. Parity and the bankers did the same thing there in 2000 they're doing
[1:08:22.660 --> 1:08:29.780]  here and the country went from first-world to complete third-world overnight and it's
[1:08:29.780 --> 1:08:35.460]  all being done by the very same people and if you don't like it, the army's here, okay,
[1:08:35.460 --> 1:08:37.260]  they're here to get the pension fund.
[1:08:37.260 --> 1:08:41.620]  The army will guard while their fathers and mothers pension funds are taken, that's how
[1:08:41.620 --> 1:08:43.620]  it works.
[1:08:43.620 --> 1:08:46.700]  Let's go ahead and talk to Greg in New York, Greg, you're on the air.
[1:08:46.700 --> 1:08:48.300]  Hey, how are you doing now?
[1:08:48.300 --> 1:08:49.300]  Good, sir.
[1:08:49.300 --> 1:08:54.060]  I spoke to you yesterday as well when you had Robert Groden on the phone, I got to tell
[1:08:54.060 --> 1:08:58.940]  you about everything that's going on, not only are you absolutely right and it's as
[1:08:58.940 --> 1:09:04.780]  transparent as can be, I mean, these people are hiding in plain sight and when it comes
[1:09:04.780 --> 1:09:11.340]  down to it, we have to take control of the money in this country and the biggest problem,
[1:09:11.340 --> 1:09:15.180]  as you said, there's a lot of cowards out there and what these people really want to
[1:09:15.180 --> 1:09:21.260]  do to us is basically make us a bunch of dandy-bodied duchies that walk around and are complete
[1:09:21.260 --> 1:09:23.700]  morons and don't know what's going on in the world.
[1:09:23.700 --> 1:09:30.420]  Yeah, a bunch of trendy, know-it-alls, cowardly, licking any black uniform they see.
[1:09:30.420 --> 1:09:35.660]  And I'm going to tell you one thing that's when the revolution cataclysm was in Russia
[1:09:35.660 --> 1:09:40.140]  with the Tsar's, the thing that they've used to get control in this country is what we
[1:09:40.140 --> 1:09:41.780]  as revolutionists need to do.
[1:09:41.780 --> 1:09:45.980]  We must put the revolution before anything, before our parents, before our children, before
[1:09:45.980 --> 1:09:46.980]  our wives.
[1:09:46.980 --> 1:09:50.980]  The depth of the New World Order should be the only thing more important than our own
[1:09:50.980 --> 1:09:52.540]  lives and anything else.
[1:09:52.540 --> 1:09:56.980]  And you know what, the traders in this country, the media, the government, if we can't get
[1:09:56.980 --> 1:10:00.460]  them in this life, then we'll get their kids, we'll get their grandkids and the whole point
[1:10:00.460 --> 1:10:04.540]  of the matter is we will win, just like they want a New World Order.
[1:10:04.540 --> 1:10:08.700]  We got to love our revolution just as much as they love theirs and I guarantee you they
[1:10:08.700 --> 1:10:09.940]  will not win.
[1:10:09.940 --> 1:10:14.300]  There's many people out there that feel it like I do and there's many people out there
[1:10:14.300 --> 1:10:20.260]  that love the revolution as much as I do and I just want to say God bless you and we will
[1:10:20.260 --> 1:10:21.260]  win.
[1:10:21.260 --> 1:10:22.260]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[1:10:22.260 --> 1:10:23.260]  We will win.
[1:10:23.260 --> 1:10:24.260]  Evil always falls in its own way.
[1:10:24.260 --> 1:10:27.340]  I wouldn't call a revolution, it's survival, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:10:27.340 --> 1:10:32.540]  This is a scientifically directed and focused dictatorship.
[1:10:32.540 --> 1:10:33.540]  This is worldwide.
[1:10:33.540 --> 1:10:38.460]  This is mind control and we are resisting it.
[1:10:38.460 --> 1:10:42.420]  And the sick thing is most people that enforce the criminal system, the bureaucrats, the IRS,
[1:10:42.420 --> 1:10:46.100]  all of them, the surveillance people, they're being destroyed by it too.
[1:10:46.100 --> 1:10:48.340]  John in Texas, you're on the air.
[1:10:48.340 --> 1:10:49.340]  Hi.
[1:10:49.340 --> 1:10:50.340]  Hi.
[1:10:50.340 --> 1:10:55.020]  The latest issue of the American Rifleman magazine said that George Soros, who's a big
[1:10:55.020 --> 1:11:00.700]  money man behind Obama, had brought a woman over from Australia to work in his campaign
[1:11:00.700 --> 1:11:04.300]  and that woman was one of the main forces of the big gun grab in Australia.
[1:11:04.300 --> 1:11:08.060]  So that would pretty much show what's going to happen under Obama.
[1:11:08.060 --> 1:11:09.060]  Oh, it's...
[1:11:09.060 --> 1:11:12.620]  Listen, again, both candidates are New World Order, they're both anti-gun, but Obama has
[1:11:12.620 --> 1:11:19.340]  said on record, it's true, that he wants to ban all rifles that shoot 223 and 308 and
[1:11:19.340 --> 1:11:20.340]  that's like half of them.
[1:11:20.340 --> 1:11:21.340]  I mean, we're just...
[1:11:21.340 --> 1:11:22.340]  I mean, it's...
[1:11:22.340 --> 1:11:25.340]  And again, if you're not returning your guns in, you're going to be called a racist.
[1:11:25.340 --> 1:11:29.540]  Yeah, I think McCain, if McCain gets in there, he may not be quite as anti-gun, but he'll
[1:11:29.540 --> 1:11:32.060]  probably do a lot of stuff under the radar like Bush did.
[1:11:32.060 --> 1:11:33.060]  McCain's been...
[1:11:33.060 --> 1:11:37.340]  Well, for the Sullivan's ban, he's a gun grabber, he's pure wickedness, but God help
[1:11:37.340 --> 1:11:38.340]  us, folks.
[1:11:38.340 --> 1:11:39.340]  We're...
[1:11:39.340 --> 1:11:40.340]  It's...
[1:11:40.340 --> 1:11:41.340]  It's...
[1:11:41.340 --> 1:11:44.060]  I mean, they need the guns because they need the pension funds, but they're just going
[1:11:44.060 --> 1:11:46.420]  to go ahead and take them and they hope people fight.
[1:11:46.420 --> 1:11:51.820]  Well, if it comes down to it, Alex, I mean, I'm not one to advocate a gun out there now
[1:11:51.820 --> 1:11:55.420]  and start doing a lot of crap, but if our backs against the wall and we ain't got nothing
[1:11:55.420 --> 1:11:59.380]  to lose, we might as well start blasting because we won't have nothing to lose.
[1:11:59.380 --> 1:12:03.620]  Yeah, well, a lot of these cowards in the system are just so used to people being able
[1:12:03.620 --> 1:12:08.300]  to feed on people, kidnap children for the state, commit all their crimes, and God, I
[1:12:08.300 --> 1:12:11.180]  feel sorry for them because they have no idea what's going to happen to them.
[1:12:11.180 --> 1:12:12.180]  They have no idea.
[1:12:12.180 --> 1:12:16.620]  Now, I know it's all part of the globalist plan, but they don't understand that they're
[1:12:16.620 --> 1:12:18.700]  snickering and laughing right now, and I just feel...
[1:12:18.700 --> 1:12:20.220]  I really feel sorry for them, actually.
[1:12:20.220 --> 1:12:24.260]  A lot of them are cowardly, they're not real men, they're all about cornering, people tend
[1:12:24.260 --> 1:12:27.700]  to one, they've never really been hurt bad in their life, they don't understand that
[1:12:27.700 --> 1:12:32.140]  violence, once it goes both ways, isn't fun, isn't fun either way, and they're going to
[1:12:32.140 --> 1:12:34.300]  cry for their mommies.
[1:12:34.300 --> 1:12:36.100]  They always cry for their mommy.
[1:12:36.100 --> 1:12:38.500]  Okay, Alex, that's all I got.
[1:12:38.500 --> 1:12:40.180]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[1:12:40.180 --> 1:12:42.580]  Mark in Oregon, you're on the air.
[1:12:42.580 --> 1:12:44.900]  Go ahead, Alex.
[1:12:44.900 --> 1:12:45.900]  Welcome.
[1:12:45.900 --> 1:12:46.900]  Yes, sir.
[1:12:46.900 --> 1:12:50.820]  I have a couple of guest suggestions for you.
[1:12:50.820 --> 1:12:57.900]  And the first one is Congressman Paul Brown, B-R-O-U-N, it's not the W-N, it's in the color
[1:12:57.900 --> 1:13:06.220]  words, B-R-O-U-N, U.S. Congressman in Washington, D.C., I heard him interviewed last Friday
[1:13:06.220 --> 1:13:13.900]  on Rick Walsh show, and he's very outspoken, he is, I think he would make a tremendous
[1:13:13.900 --> 1:13:14.900]  guest for you.
[1:13:14.900 --> 1:13:15.900]  Say his name again.
[1:13:15.900 --> 1:13:16.900]  I didn't write it down.
[1:13:16.900 --> 1:13:17.900]  Yes, sir.
[1:13:17.900 --> 1:13:26.180]  It's Paul Brown, he's actually a medical doctor, and you spell his last name, B-R-O-U-N, his
[1:13:26.180 --> 1:13:27.180]  website.
[1:13:27.180 --> 1:13:28.940]  Is he a federal Congressman?
[1:13:28.940 --> 1:13:30.860]  Yes, sir.
[1:13:30.860 --> 1:13:39.380]  And his website is brownbron.house.gov.
[1:13:39.380 --> 1:13:42.020]  We don't have to find it, Dr. Paul Brown.
[1:13:42.020 --> 1:13:47.860]  The other is Bill Schneblin, I don't know if you've heard of him, Alex, but he was involved
[1:13:47.860 --> 1:13:53.060]  at very high levels of the Illuminati for many years, and about 15 years ago he converted
[1:13:53.060 --> 1:13:54.060]  to Christianity.
[1:13:54.060 --> 1:14:01.220]  He's put out a very eclectic and massive amount of information, excuse me.
[1:14:01.220 --> 1:14:03.460]  I think I've seen some of that on YouTube, yeah.
[1:14:03.460 --> 1:14:10.460]  Yeah, some of his book and video titles, for instance, with one would be Lucifer dethroned,
[1:14:10.460 --> 1:14:17.900]  another would be exposing the Illuminati from within, another would be the medical conspiracy,
[1:14:17.900 --> 1:14:21.740]  another is Israel, Islam, and biochemical warfare.
[1:14:21.740 --> 1:14:25.060]  Now, his website is withoneaccord.org.
[1:14:25.060 --> 1:14:31.620]  Yeah, listen, I appreciate your call.
[1:14:31.620 --> 1:14:34.620]  Who's up next here?
[1:14:34.620 --> 1:14:35.620]  Richard in Texas.
[1:14:35.620 --> 1:14:36.620]  Richard, you're on the air.
[1:14:36.620 --> 1:14:37.620]  Go ahead.
[1:14:37.620 --> 1:14:40.700]  I've got a favorite to ask you guys real quick.
[1:14:40.700 --> 1:14:45.340]  I just got an email from Rick Perry asking to basically forward this email off, and I
[1:14:45.340 --> 1:14:51.660]  could win a lunch with him, and I'm trying to get basically as many people as I can
[1:14:51.660 --> 1:14:55.220]  to open up this email, and I get 10 points for every email that's opened.
[1:14:55.220 --> 1:14:59.980]  I supported it on to you guys in hopes that you guys could help me with this, and I'm
[1:14:59.980 --> 1:15:04.140]  a lot to bring to guests, and if I win, it would be great to have you there to help
[1:15:04.140 --> 1:15:09.060]  ask some questions that I wanted to ask Rick Perry on camera concerning some local issues
[1:15:09.060 --> 1:15:13.060]  that we have here in Austin.
[1:15:13.060 --> 1:15:15.700]  I doubt they're going to let me in a meeting with him.
[1:15:15.700 --> 1:15:18.860]  Well, I mean, actually, I know some of his people.
[1:15:18.860 --> 1:15:20.300]  They've actually told me I could probably have a meeting.
[1:15:20.300 --> 1:15:26.340]  I forgot about that, and he did come on the show once.
[1:15:26.340 --> 1:15:32.380]  But I'm not mad, but see how it's like every call is like a plug, and then it just kind
[1:15:32.380 --> 1:15:37.020]  of turns into weird talk radio, but hell, I'll just go ahead and do it.
[1:15:37.020 --> 1:15:38.740]  I mean, it's a good idea you got.
[1:15:38.740 --> 1:15:40.540]  How do folks get the email from you?
[1:15:40.540 --> 1:15:44.140]  Well, I forwarded it on to you guys, actually, to Aaron at infowars.com.
[1:15:44.140 --> 1:15:49.940]  Well, Aaron was here till two in the morning, so he's not here right now.
[1:15:49.940 --> 1:15:50.940]  It's okay.
[1:15:50.940 --> 1:15:52.940]  And then we're supposed to forward it out again.
[1:15:52.940 --> 1:15:53.940]  That would be awesome.
[1:15:53.940 --> 1:15:57.820]  I mean, I know you guys have a great, you know, but how do you win it because we forward
[1:15:57.820 --> 1:15:58.820]  it?
[1:15:58.820 --> 1:16:02.500]  10, 10 points because you guys would forward it and it's connected to me.
[1:16:02.500 --> 1:16:06.820]  There's, I guess, there's some, uh, uh, electrical link to the, you know, why don't you, well,
[1:16:06.820 --> 1:16:11.580]  why don't you give us the link, uh, publicly, the link you've got and people can come visit
[1:16:11.580 --> 1:16:12.580]  your email.
[1:16:12.580 --> 1:16:13.580]  How's that sound?
[1:16:13.580 --> 1:16:14.580]  Okay.
[1:16:14.580 --> 1:16:15.580]  I don't, I don't have it right now.
[1:16:15.580 --> 1:16:16.580]  I'm sitting in my car at work.
[1:16:16.580 --> 1:16:19.780]  So, um, I'll, I can, I can, I guess give it to you via email.
[1:16:19.780 --> 1:16:20.780]  Okay.
[1:16:20.780 --> 1:16:25.740]  Well, what'll happen is if I post that, uh, then the Perry office will, will, will probably
[1:16:25.740 --> 1:16:29.300]  just disqualify it, but anything else, sir?
[1:16:29.300 --> 1:16:30.780]  Uh, that's it.
[1:16:30.780 --> 1:16:31.780]  Great show yesterday.
[1:16:31.780 --> 1:16:32.780]  That was very powerful.
[1:16:32.780 --> 1:16:33.780]  Thank you, Richard.
[1:16:33.780 --> 1:16:34.780]  I appreciate the call.
[1:16:34.780 --> 1:16:36.020]  Uh, Herbert and Georgia.
[1:16:36.020 --> 1:16:37.020]  Go ahead.
[1:16:37.020 --> 1:16:39.020]  Uh, Alex, how'd you do it?
[1:16:39.020 --> 1:16:40.020]  Good.
[1:16:40.020 --> 1:16:41.020]  This is Tony Montana.
[1:16:41.020 --> 1:16:42.020]  Tony Montana, huh?
[1:16:42.020 --> 1:16:43.020]  This is Tony Montana.
[1:16:43.020 --> 1:16:44.020]  That's, that's my, uh, acting hero.
[1:16:44.020 --> 1:16:54.380]  You know, Alex, I tell you, man, uh, I've, uh, got everything, uh, that you got out
[1:16:54.380 --> 1:16:56.020]  and you was absolutely right.
[1:16:56.020 --> 1:17:02.020]  Uh, 9-11 wrote the tyranny was the first shot over the bow.
[1:17:02.020 --> 1:17:06.980]  It was the first shot over the bow and I told these people at satellite radio, I've been
[1:17:06.980 --> 1:17:11.420]  bigging these people on satellite radio to, to, uh, put you on there on the power station.
[1:17:11.420 --> 1:17:15.940]  They have not done it yet and I will be notifying them that I'm canceling all that propaganda.
[1:17:15.940 --> 1:17:22.180]  Well, that's, you know, we really tried to get on Sirius and XM, but it's owned predominantly.
[1:17:22.180 --> 1:17:26.660]  They've now merged by Clear Channel and they like to produce their own shows and, and you
[1:17:26.660 --> 1:17:28.100]  know, put it on their own platforms.
[1:17:28.100 --> 1:17:32.100]  Uh, satellite's great, but overall there's only about what 10 million subscribers and
[1:17:32.100 --> 1:17:33.100]  500 channels.
[1:17:33.100 --> 1:17:39.100]  So the audience is, is, is good, but it's not as gargantuan as some seem to think, but
[1:17:39.100 --> 1:17:41.420]  over time it's going to get bigger and bigger.
[1:17:41.420 --> 1:17:46.340]  And yes, it would be a great victory, uh, to get on to XM.
[1:17:46.340 --> 1:17:50.460]  I've been begging them addicts and I've already told them, I'll call them twice.
[1:17:50.460 --> 1:17:56.580]  I told them that I'm, I'm tired of the Obama soap opera and, um, you know, because it's
[1:17:56.580 --> 1:18:02.020]  based on subscription, uh, I made a recommendation, um, for you to be on there.
[1:18:02.020 --> 1:18:07.460]  I noticed, um, one Genesis guy is on there, uh, which is that Rob Redding, because I hear
[1:18:07.460 --> 1:18:12.300]  you doing ads when he's, uh, when this show is on, he's, uh, he's okay, but he's not as
[1:18:12.300 --> 1:18:14.420]  hardcore as you are.
[1:18:14.420 --> 1:18:19.420]  And, uh, I'll tell you something else too, Alex, um, I'm getting ready to move to Austin
[1:18:19.420 --> 1:18:22.700]  because when the crap is the fan, I want to be just like you.
[1:18:22.700 --> 1:18:26.300]  When I get ready to leave town, anybody get in my way, gonna have some problems.
[1:18:26.300 --> 1:18:32.980]  But, uh, you know, I tell you, Alex, I pray for you all the time, brother, because there
[1:18:32.980 --> 1:18:37.700]  is only, um, a handful of patriots left in this country.
[1:18:37.700 --> 1:18:38.700]  You have to top.
[1:18:38.700 --> 1:18:43.820]  I came up with a new ticket for the presidential race this late, two weeks, two weeks left.
[1:18:43.820 --> 1:18:47.860]  Uh, Alex Jones and Jim Tucker, that's my ticket.
[1:18:47.860 --> 1:18:52.340]  Well, listen, uh, uh, you're great, my friend, Herbert, uh, how long have you been listening
[1:18:52.340 --> 1:18:53.340]  to the show?
[1:18:53.340 --> 1:18:59.020]  Man, I got your own, uh, I've been listening to you now, um, easily a couple of years now.
[1:18:59.020 --> 1:19:04.180]  I got, I got the, uh, real player and all, and when I just get so disgusted, listen to
[1:19:04.180 --> 1:19:08.460]  the propaganda on satellite radio and the, and the propaganda on TV, I say, I just go
[1:19:08.460 --> 1:19:10.780]  turn on my computer on and I get you live.
[1:19:10.780 --> 1:19:12.780]  Well, God bless you, Herbert.
[1:19:12.780 --> 1:19:14.900]  Herbert, call back again, great hearing from you.
[1:19:14.900 --> 1:19:19.300]  Joe, Mike, Shane, Brian, others, we'll talk about the election, whatever you like to discuss
[1:19:19.300 --> 1:19:23.260]  when we get back to economy, what the bankers are doing right now.
[1:19:23.260 --> 1:19:28.060]  But thanks to people like Herbert, that's how we're getting on AM and FM stations and
[1:19:28.060 --> 1:19:29.060]  other outlets.
[1:19:29.060 --> 1:19:30.060]  So thank you, Herbert.
[1:19:30.060 --> 1:19:31.060]  You're the best.
[1:19:31.060 --> 1:19:33.060]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[1:19:33.060 --> 1:19:35.420]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[1:19:35.420 --> 1:19:37.700]  I can't find my wallet.
[1:19:37.700 --> 1:19:38.700]  Sound familiar?
[1:19:38.700 --> 1:19:41.860]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?

[1:19:51.580 --> 1:19:53.420]  be found by all the rest.

[1:19:57.780 --> 1:19:59.780]  find an uncharged or muted cell phone.

[1:20:05.740 --> 1:20:07.660]  90 plus decibel beep.
[1:20:07.660 --> 1:20:09.300]  Got the remote.
[1:20:09.300 --> 1:20:11.420]  Oh, my keys.

[1:20:31.500 --> 1:20:33.420]  The economy is collapsing all around us.
[1:20:33.420 --> 1:20:34.420]  Banks are closing.
[1:20:34.420 --> 1:20:38.060]  The Federal Reserve continues to pump billions of dollars into the system to try to stop
[1:20:38.060 --> 1:20:39.060]  the bleeding.
[1:20:39.060 --> 1:20:40.460]  Know who is to blame.
[1:20:40.460 --> 1:20:42.460]  The Federal Reserve System.
[1:20:42.460 --> 1:20:45.100]  On November 22nd, the end begins.
[1:20:45.100 --> 1:20:49.620]  Every Federal Reserve Bank, every Federal Reserve office, 38 cities, one purpose.
[1:20:49.620 --> 1:20:50.620]  End the Fed.

[1:21:07.660 --> 1:21:10.220]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[1:21:10.220 --> 1:21:13.340]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[1:21:13.340 --> 1:21:14.340]  It is liquid.
[1:21:14.340 --> 1:21:15.340]  It is private.
[1:21:15.340 --> 1:21:16.340]  It owes no one.
[1:21:16.340 --> 1:21:20.700]  It cannot go bankrupt and it maintains its purchasing power.

[1:21:53.940 --> 1:21:55.860]  crime are brought to justice.

[1:22:36.980 --> 1:22:40.580]  the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[1:22:40.580 --> 1:22:44.940]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic
[1:22:44.940 --> 1:22:48.580]  diseases from these parasites, and your doctor would never know it.
[1:22:48.580 --> 1:22:53.180]  In fact, clinically-detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[1:22:53.180 --> 1:22:56.020]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[1:22:56.020 --> 1:23:00.740]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol, naturally

[1:23:54.380 --> 1:24:12.340]  Let's continue with your phone calls.
[1:24:12.340 --> 1:24:14.580]  Joe in Illinois, welcome.
[1:24:14.580 --> 1:24:18.100]  Hi, how's it going?
[1:24:18.100 --> 1:24:19.100]  Good, Joe.
[1:24:19.100 --> 1:24:24.740]  I was just calling one major question a day, I got 10 and a half days or something of election
[1:24:24.740 --> 1:24:25.740]  coming up.
[1:24:25.740 --> 1:24:29.660]  I have a choice of three things to do, either stay home and not do anything, go and vote
[1:24:29.660 --> 1:24:32.820]  for Ron Paul, which is what I was planning on doing forever, but I don't know it's going
[1:24:32.820 --> 1:24:36.660]  to be any good other than throwing a vote away, or vote for one of these other jackass
[1:24:36.660 --> 1:24:38.980]  puppets that are going to get in the White House.
[1:24:38.980 --> 1:24:39.980]  What do I do?
[1:24:39.980 --> 1:24:43.740]  Well, I mean, it's important, I think, to be involved in the electoral process because
[1:24:43.740 --> 1:24:47.940]  that's what documents the fraud, that's what's the eyes and the ears out there.
[1:24:47.940 --> 1:24:51.420]  But that's not our only course of action, this is part of what we do.
[1:24:51.420 --> 1:24:57.060]  I don't know about your area of Illinois, but I know most of it is run by electronic
[1:24:57.060 --> 1:24:59.180]  fraud machines.
[1:24:59.180 --> 1:25:02.500]  That's why, no matter what the people want, the government does the opposite.
[1:25:02.500 --> 1:25:08.420]  I mean, Chicago is the model of corruption for the entire world basically right now with
[1:25:08.420 --> 1:25:10.100]  the systems it developed.
[1:25:10.100 --> 1:25:15.220]  Great people, bad system, because corruption got control, but Ron Paul has said don't vote
[1:25:15.220 --> 1:25:19.020]  for him because if it's not on the ballot, it just gets thrown away, the vote for Chuck
[1:25:19.020 --> 1:25:24.300]  Baldwin or Ralph Nader, you can vote for somebody else just to boost the third party.
[1:25:24.300 --> 1:25:27.980]  And by the way, third party numbers, the media is not giving it attention, but third party
[1:25:27.980 --> 1:25:33.620]  is getting 15, 16, 70% almost every state and every group in the polls, but then they
[1:25:33.620 --> 1:25:35.020]  just ignore it.
[1:25:35.020 --> 1:25:39.700]  So what we really need to push for is open debates with people like Ron Paul, Ralph Nader,
[1:25:39.700 --> 1:25:43.740]  you know, big third party candidates in the future, but they shut things down by only
[1:25:43.740 --> 1:25:45.820]  having the two parties.
[1:25:45.820 --> 1:25:51.700]  So that's a big issue, fighting for election integrity, exposing both election fraud and
[1:25:51.700 --> 1:25:55.060]  voter fraud, you know, both ends of that spectrum.
[1:25:55.060 --> 1:25:58.380]  So you know yourself better, you know what, I mean, I'm not going to tell you what you
[1:25:58.380 --> 1:26:03.420]  should do, but I wouldn't vote for Ron Paul because that will throw up just completely
[1:26:03.420 --> 1:26:04.420]  throw it away.
[1:26:04.420 --> 1:26:06.860]  I mean, they'll just, we'll see it on there, it won't even be tabulated.
[1:26:06.860 --> 1:26:13.100]  I think only one state, he's in Louisiana, he's actually been put on the ballot by folks
[1:26:13.100 --> 1:26:14.100]  there.
[1:26:14.100 --> 1:26:16.660]  So I would vote for a third party.
[1:26:16.660 --> 1:26:20.140]  Some are saying that Obama's got so much muscle behind him and so much of the system
[1:26:20.140 --> 1:26:24.180]  behind him that vote for McCain, but I can't vote for lesser of two evils.
[1:26:24.180 --> 1:26:29.100]  I can't do the immoral thing of, you know, well, they're both evil, they're both new
[1:26:29.100 --> 1:26:30.100]  world order.
[1:26:30.100 --> 1:26:32.900]  So, you know, I'll just vote for the one that didn't, you know, that doesn't look like
[1:26:32.900 --> 1:26:36.220]  he's got as much muscle behind him, but who knows what's going to happen.
[1:26:36.220 --> 1:26:39.860]  They may pull a rabbit out of a hat and cheat the election and give it to McCain.
[1:26:39.860 --> 1:26:44.020]  I have no doubt if there's a real election that Barack Obama's going to win.
[1:26:44.020 --> 1:26:45.580]  And you know, just, just God help us.
[1:26:45.580 --> 1:26:47.900]  I, I'm not going to sit up here and bash him.
[1:26:47.900 --> 1:26:49.860]  I'm going to let people just find out for themselves.
[1:26:49.860 --> 1:26:53.620]  He's going to do everything the establishment wants.
[1:26:53.620 --> 1:26:56.580]  And they just give it a new coat of paint, the same old new world order.
[1:26:56.580 --> 1:27:00.540]  I mean, it did, you know, I don't care that the guys got brown skin.
[1:27:00.540 --> 1:27:03.300]  There are a lot of races that don't like him because he, he does.
[1:27:03.300 --> 1:27:07.460]  And so that makes it an issue with people.
[1:27:07.460 --> 1:27:12.180]  And so we're, hey, we, we, we've got 11 days we're going to find out my friend.
[1:27:12.180 --> 1:27:16.540]  Well, thanks for your interest anyway, and then I want to thank you for all your sponsors
[1:27:16.540 --> 1:27:17.540]  that you have.
[1:27:17.540 --> 1:27:18.540]  I just got my Berkey lighting.
[1:27:18.540 --> 1:27:19.540]  I love it.
[1:27:19.540 --> 1:27:20.540]  It's a great system.
[1:27:20.540 --> 1:27:21.900]  Great to gravity-fed filter there.
[1:27:21.900 --> 1:27:22.900]  Thank you, my friend.
[1:27:22.900 --> 1:27:24.420]  Mike in Florida, you're on the air.
[1:27:24.420 --> 1:27:25.420]  Go ahead.
[1:27:25.420 --> 1:27:26.420]  How are you?
[1:27:26.420 --> 1:27:27.420]  Good, my friend.
[1:27:27.420 --> 1:27:31.180]  I just want to thank you also for, for all the movies, man.
[1:27:31.180 --> 1:27:34.860]  Tell Jason Bermont, thank you for all the movies as well because you woke me up three
[1:27:34.860 --> 1:27:35.860]  years ago.
[1:27:35.860 --> 1:27:41.060]  I tell you, man, I was reading last night an article on Google news and it also says
[1:27:41.060 --> 1:27:50.100]  that Bush is planning to plant some U.S. troops posts on an Iran, and what I was thinking is
[1:27:50.100 --> 1:27:54.420]  probably, maybe that might be the pretext of the little, you know, operation northwards
[1:27:54.420 --> 1:27:55.420]  rubbing its head again.
[1:27:55.420 --> 1:28:02.820]  You know, it's amazing for five years, U.S. special forces have been in Iran attacking
[1:28:02.820 --> 1:28:06.140]  Iranian troops and civilians and police.
[1:28:06.140 --> 1:28:10.100]  Then last year, George Bush in the White House press release admitted it and admitted their
[1:28:10.100 --> 1:28:15.260]  funding for al-Qaeda groups, Wahhabis out of Saudi Arabia, inside the country to attack
[1:28:15.260 --> 1:28:20.500]  them, including the number three in al-Qaeda commanding it, with U.S. funding and forces.
[1:28:20.500 --> 1:28:21.500]  It's so criminal.
[1:28:21.500 --> 1:28:23.860]  I mean, and Iran lays there and takes it.
[1:28:23.860 --> 1:28:28.020]  They're suing the United States in the hage over it, asking the United States to stop
[1:28:28.020 --> 1:28:30.460]  staging terror attacks, and the U.S. admits they are.
[1:28:30.460 --> 1:28:33.300]  See, that's how evil our government is.
[1:28:33.300 --> 1:28:41.060]  They admit they're committing illegal military attacks every week in Iran, blowing up dams,
[1:28:41.060 --> 1:28:47.180]  bombing schools, attacking police stations to get the Iranians to fight back.
[1:28:47.180 --> 1:28:54.660]  It might be the threat that Colin Powell was telling us about January 25th, was it, or
[1:28:54.660 --> 1:28:55.660]  24th?
[1:28:55.660 --> 1:28:56.660]  Yeah, he said 22nd or 23rd.
[1:28:56.660 --> 1:29:02.660]  Yeah, that might also be the case right there, the pretext to an attack to test the president.
[1:29:02.660 --> 1:29:09.900]  Also, I also read, I remember when you brought up that Osama bin Laden might be captured just
[1:29:09.900 --> 1:29:10.900]  for...
[1:29:10.900 --> 1:29:11.900]  Hold on, stay there, stay there.
[1:29:11.900 --> 1:29:12.900]  Yeah, now they're saying that in the media.
[1:29:12.900 --> 1:29:14.900]  Look, these people never round.
[1:29:14.900 --> 1:29:22.420]  We'll be right back.
[1:29:22.420 --> 1:29:23.700]  We're on the march.
[1:29:23.700 --> 1:29:26.420]  The empire's on the run.
[1:29:26.420 --> 1:29:32.020]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:32.020 --> 1:29:35.100]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[1:29:35.100 --> 1:29:40.700]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[1:29:40.700 --> 1:29:45.260]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which
[1:29:45.260 --> 1:29:46.260]  are synthetic.
[1:29:46.260 --> 1:29:47.260]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[1:29:47.260 --> 1:29:51.380]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to

[1:30:31.020 --> 1:30:37.060]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:30:37.060 --> 1:30:38.560]  against this country.
[1:30:38.560 --> 1:30:40.700]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[1:30:40.700 --> 1:30:42.700]  But who is the enemy?
[1:30:42.700 --> 1:30:43.700]  Bin Laden.
[1:30:43.700 --> 1:30:44.700]  This is his MO.
[1:30:44.700 --> 1:30:45.700]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:30:45.700 --> 1:30:47.700]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:30:47.700 --> 1:30:52.540]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:30:52.540 --> 1:30:55.140]  networks inside the United States.
[1:30:55.140 --> 1:30:59.620]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[1:30:59.620 --> 1:31:01.780]  in and on the U.S.
[1:31:01.780 --> 1:31:05.380]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:31:05.380 --> 1:31:10.940]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:31:10.940 --> 1:31:15.100]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[1:31:15.100 --> 1:31:16.100]  much more.
[1:31:16.100 --> 1:31:21.580]  Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with

[1:31:32.100 --> 1:31:33.100]  Question.
[1:31:33.100 --> 1:31:37.540]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[1:31:37.540 --> 1:31:42.540]  The world economic collapse could come any day.
[1:31:42.540 --> 1:31:48.540]  Question, are you prepared, or are you ignoring the signs?
[1:31:48.540 --> 1:31:49.540]  Question.
[1:31:49.540 --> 1:31:56.340]  Do you have 7 years of healthy food for your family?

[1:32:41.420 --> 1:32:50.260]  We got Bob Chapman joining us in 30 minutes to talk about the economic gyrations.
[1:32:50.260 --> 1:32:52.580]  Mike Rivera with us from the next 30.
[1:32:52.580 --> 1:32:59.300]  But I wanted to go back to Mike and Florida, and we'll talk to Shane, Brian, Jay and others
[1:32:59.300 --> 1:33:00.300]  too.
[1:33:00.300 --> 1:33:03.380]  We'll go deeper in the interview with Rivera over at www.whatreallyhappened.com.
[1:33:03.380 --> 1:33:06.340]  Mike, you were finishing up a question before we went to break.
[1:33:06.340 --> 1:33:07.340]  Go ahead.
[1:33:07.340 --> 1:33:12.260]  Yeah, I read an article last night also that there were rumors that Osama bin Laden and
[1:33:12.260 --> 1:33:15.780]  Al Qaeda's websites were being hacked into.
[1:33:15.780 --> 1:33:21.060]  And I remember when you brought up that Osama bin Laden possibly might be captured before
[1:33:21.060 --> 1:33:24.220]  the elections are over just to boost up the Republicans.
[1:33:24.220 --> 1:33:32.420]  Well, before the 9-11 attack, the NSA shut down most of the real Muslim Wahhabist sites
[1:33:32.420 --> 1:33:35.620]  so that they couldn't come out and say, we didn't do it.
[1:33:35.620 --> 1:33:40.460]  On the sites they didn't take down, they did come out and say, the West just did this,
[1:33:40.460 --> 1:33:41.700]  we didn't do it.
[1:33:41.700 --> 1:33:45.700]  And the confirmed bin Laden said, I didn't do this, the West just did this.
[1:33:45.700 --> 1:33:52.260]  And then they used their little fake video morphed, now put them into the fake videos.
[1:33:52.260 --> 1:33:56.460]  Now he's an asset, and he knew he was going to take the blame, but it wasn't supposed
[1:33:56.460 --> 1:33:57.740]  to be that intense of a blame.
[1:33:57.740 --> 1:34:03.140]  That's why Bandar Bush, his nickname, Prince Bandar, on Larry King Live, said, how dare
[1:34:03.140 --> 1:34:04.420]  you talk about bin Laden?
[1:34:04.420 --> 1:34:05.420]  He's a great man.
[1:34:05.420 --> 1:34:10.060]  And Larry King Live said, OK, OK, I mean, days after 9-11.
[1:34:10.060 --> 1:34:11.940]  So he's a big hero over there.
[1:34:11.940 --> 1:34:16.460]  His family got made 3 billion extras in the first few months after the attacks in US weapons
[1:34:16.460 --> 1:34:22.620]  contracts and US construction contracts on bases that hold the weapons, is what I meant
[1:34:22.620 --> 1:34:23.780]  to say.
[1:34:23.780 --> 1:34:25.060]  And so it's just completely staged.
[1:34:25.060 --> 1:34:30.340]  And yeah, they're talking about this big event that's going to happen the 22nd or 23rd.
[1:34:30.340 --> 1:34:34.820]  They say it's going to be huge, but they can't tell you what the event's going to be.
[1:34:34.820 --> 1:34:37.700]  They did the same kind of stuff right before 9-11.
[1:34:37.700 --> 1:34:42.100]  But Powell made it sound economic, all the others.
[1:34:42.100 --> 1:34:49.860]  And I mean, Chertoff, the European leaders, the British leaders, they all implied it was
[1:34:49.860 --> 1:34:51.540]  going to be military.
[1:34:51.540 --> 1:34:54.020]  So that's one reason I have Mike Rivera on.
[1:34:54.020 --> 1:34:55.020]  So we're going to ask him right now.
[1:34:55.020 --> 1:34:56.660]  I appreciate your call.
[1:34:56.660 --> 1:35:02.540]  I love getting the political analysis of Mike Rivera, talk show host here on Genesis, what
[1:35:02.540 --> 1:35:05.620]  at five o'clock central, he comes on for an hour show, weekdays.
[1:35:05.620 --> 1:35:09.140]  I always like having Mike on, and especially as we go into the election, I'm going to have
[1:35:09.140 --> 1:35:13.860]  him on more than once a month to give us his take on what's happening with the economy,
[1:35:13.860 --> 1:35:20.540]  the buildup, the saber rattling for war with Russia that we see intensified with Voice
[1:35:20.540 --> 1:35:25.500]  of America and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying that if Russia defends itself
[1:35:25.500 --> 1:35:29.340]  in any way, and that's what the statement really means, that the US is basically going
[1:35:29.340 --> 1:35:30.340]  to nuke them.
[1:35:30.340 --> 1:35:33.380]  So I wanted to go over that with Mike Rivera as well briefly.
[1:35:33.380 --> 1:35:39.580]  But Mike, yeah, what about all this talk of a huge surprise, a huge test on Obama the
[1:35:39.580 --> 1:35:40.780]  day he's inaugurated?
[1:35:40.780 --> 1:35:46.180]  Do we have Mike Rivera over there?
[1:35:46.180 --> 1:35:48.980]  Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were talking to the other Mike.
[1:35:48.980 --> 1:35:49.980]  I'm sorry.
[1:35:49.980 --> 1:35:51.620]  No, no, I just let Mike go.
[1:35:51.620 --> 1:35:52.620]  I was asking you that.
[1:35:52.620 --> 1:35:53.620]  Oh, okay.
[1:35:53.620 --> 1:35:54.620]  I'm sorry.
[1:35:54.620 --> 1:35:55.620]  Could you repeat the question again?
[1:35:55.620 --> 1:35:56.620]  I apologize.
[1:35:56.620 --> 1:35:58.420]  I'm watching news feeds at the same time.
[1:35:58.420 --> 1:36:00.260]  No, no, I understand.
[1:36:00.260 --> 1:36:05.580]  They've been talking about a giant crisis facing Barack Obama in the first two days
[1:36:05.580 --> 1:36:12.580]  of his candidacy, and one person implied, Colin Powell last Sunday, that it was going
[1:36:12.580 --> 1:36:14.780]  to be economic.
[1:36:14.780 --> 1:36:20.220]  And then all the rest, Biden, Republicans, Democrats, European leaders, that it will
[1:36:20.220 --> 1:36:24.060]  be military, your take on what that crisis will be.
[1:36:24.060 --> 1:36:30.220]  Well, I think when Biden was first making the comment, I don't know that he had any
[1:36:30.220 --> 1:36:31.540]  anything specific in mind.
[1:36:31.540 --> 1:36:35.340]  I think he was basically just trying to say that every time our nation has a change of
[1:36:35.340 --> 1:36:40.700]  leadership, that other nations around the world who do not like us will sort of probe
[1:36:40.700 --> 1:36:46.060]  to see what kind of a nation the United States is going to be for the next four years.
[1:36:46.060 --> 1:36:50.340]  And he made a reference, obviously, to the Cuban Missile Crisis during Kennedy's term
[1:36:50.340 --> 1:36:51.340]  in office.
[1:36:51.340 --> 1:36:55.380]  So, I'm not sure that Biden has anything specific in mind, but I know a lot of other
[1:36:55.380 --> 1:36:57.420]  people have chimed in.
[1:36:57.420 --> 1:37:01.700]  And of course, in this election, we're probably seeing, we're setting records in terms of
[1:37:01.700 --> 1:37:06.700]  the fear-mongering that's being put out there to try and swing the election one way or the
[1:37:06.700 --> 1:37:08.020]  other back there.
[1:37:08.020 --> 1:37:13.420]  So, right now, we're getting reports that Bush at least intends to try and normalize
[1:37:13.420 --> 1:37:16.380]  relations with Iran before he leaves office.
[1:37:16.380 --> 1:37:19.700]  In other words, the war with Iran has kind of fallen off the table.
[1:37:19.700 --> 1:37:21.900]  Israel's whining about that a lot.
[1:37:21.900 --> 1:37:27.340]  So, as far as the crisis, I think, obviously, we've got an economic crisis on our hands
[1:37:27.340 --> 1:37:32.420]  that is not going to be gone by the time Obama or whoever wins the election, but it does
[1:37:32.420 --> 1:37:34.300]  look like Obama now.
[1:37:34.300 --> 1:37:38.140]  By the time he takes office, the economy is going to be the crisis, and that's the one
[1:37:38.140 --> 1:37:40.580]  he's going to have to deal with.
[1:37:40.580 --> 1:37:46.260]  Well, that's what Powell was implying, but we've seen shared off, and a bunch of other
[1:37:46.260 --> 1:37:49.540]  people say, no, no, we're talking about terrorism.
[1:37:49.540 --> 1:37:52.460]  The terrorists are going to strike, bin Laden's going to strike.
[1:37:52.460 --> 1:37:54.540]  I mean, that is clear for a mongering.
[1:37:54.540 --> 1:38:00.500]  Yeah, that is definitely fear mongering, and again, I think there are still a lot of people
[1:38:00.500 --> 1:38:06.420]  in McCain's camp who think that waving terrorist status and Osama at us is still going to have
[1:38:06.420 --> 1:38:10.060]  a chance of scaring voters back into McCain's camp.
[1:38:10.060 --> 1:38:14.780]  But I think it's kind of worn off because fear is very tiring, and you make people scared
[1:38:14.780 --> 1:38:18.540]  long enough, they just get tired of being afraid, and they burn out, they can't feel
[1:38:18.540 --> 1:38:19.540]  afraid anymore.
[1:38:19.540 --> 1:38:22.860]  That's when they calm down and start thinking objectively, and I think that's why the poll
[1:38:22.860 --> 1:38:24.940]  numbers are shifting the way they are.
[1:38:24.940 --> 1:38:29.100]  So I think it really is fear mongering for the benefit of the election.
[1:38:29.100 --> 1:38:34.700]  I don't know that anybody really sees anything on the threat board, so to speak, at this
[1:38:34.700 --> 1:38:39.580]  point, and then the next administration is going to have a chance for anyway with a declining
[1:38:39.580 --> 1:38:41.380]  American empire.
[1:38:41.380 --> 1:38:48.980]  Mike, I always really respect your even-handed, clear-headed political analysis, but I have
[1:38:48.980 --> 1:38:55.020]  to say, you tend to be, I think it's fair to say, leaning towards Obama.
[1:38:55.020 --> 1:38:58.900]  I mean, you say they're both obviously new world order corrupt, owned by the big banks,
[1:38:58.900 --> 1:39:07.700]  but then you go further to say, I think, though, that Obama represents a less wild-eyed confederation
[1:39:07.700 --> 1:39:08.700]  of the elite.
[1:39:08.700 --> 1:39:12.260]  I don't want to put words in your mouth, and then I've had a lot of people email me
[1:39:12.260 --> 1:39:15.260]  and call me and say, why is Mike Rivera supporting him?
[1:39:15.260 --> 1:39:18.180]  I mean, can he see that the media is behind him?
[1:39:18.180 --> 1:39:21.140]  Can he see that he's gotten three times the Wall Street money?
[1:39:21.140 --> 1:39:23.620]  Can he see that it gives him left cover?
[1:39:23.620 --> 1:39:29.340]  I mean, I'm not even saying I totally disagree with you, but flush that out for folks from
[1:39:29.340 --> 1:39:30.340]  your perspective.
[1:39:30.340 --> 1:39:36.300]  Well, I get a lot of the same emails, and there's a lot of that stuff going on, and
[1:39:36.300 --> 1:39:42.300]  a lot of it is intended to try and apply pressure to radio hosts such as you and I in order
[1:39:42.300 --> 1:39:44.780]  to try and get them to change their point of view.
[1:39:44.780 --> 1:39:49.980]  And it's not that I'm a real big fan of Barack Obama, I really wanted Ron Paul to get in there,
[1:39:49.980 --> 1:39:52.820]  but that's not going to happen.
[1:39:52.820 --> 1:39:56.860]  The other situation is, we're again forced to look at the lesser of two evils, and from
[1:39:56.860 --> 1:40:01.860]  my point of view, Obama is definitely the lesser of the two evils.
[1:40:01.860 --> 1:40:07.340]  Just, I think, when future history looks back on the McCain campaign, they're going to see
[1:40:07.340 --> 1:40:14.660]  his selection of Sarah Palin as the critical mistake that he made, because it really called
[1:40:14.660 --> 1:40:17.700]  into question his ability to make good decisions.
[1:40:17.700 --> 1:40:23.380]  It betrayed a certain set of assumptions about the electorate, which are not real.
[1:40:23.380 --> 1:40:29.900]  And I think ultimately that was the critical decision that is going to cost him the election.
[1:40:29.900 --> 1:40:34.300]  Now, I'm hemming and hawing here a little bit because we've got 12 days to go, and who
[1:40:34.300 --> 1:40:35.460]  knows what could happen.
[1:40:35.460 --> 1:40:40.700]  There's always the unexpected to deal with, and things could still turn around.
[1:40:40.700 --> 1:40:45.060]  But the polls are trending a certain way, the media support is beginning to trend a
[1:40:45.060 --> 1:40:51.380]  certain way, and I think there's just a general feeling in the country that the GOP has had
[1:40:51.380 --> 1:40:55.860]  their shot at trying to make things better, and even though the Democratic Congress wimped
[1:40:55.860 --> 1:41:00.700]  out for the last two years in trying to get certain things done, they still had to deal
[1:41:00.700 --> 1:41:04.060]  with a Republican president who was going to veto anything meaningful they tried to
[1:41:04.060 --> 1:41:05.060]  do.
[1:41:05.060 --> 1:41:11.180]  So I think there's this sense that we don't know what Obama is going to be doing, but
[1:41:11.180 --> 1:41:15.820]  at least it's going to be different than what we've had for the last eight years.
[1:41:15.820 --> 1:41:20.500]  I mean, McCain's voting record pretty much damns him from making any claims about being
[1:41:20.500 --> 1:41:21.940]  a maverick.
[1:41:21.940 --> 1:41:27.020]  And again, getting back to the issue of his health, he's a multi-time cancer survivor.
[1:41:27.020 --> 1:41:32.260]  Lately on the campaign trail, it's obvious the exhaustion is getting to him, and people
[1:41:32.260 --> 1:41:36.060]  are saying, we really do have to seriously look at Sarah Palin as potentially being the
[1:41:36.060 --> 1:41:39.780]  president down the road, and what kind of a job is she going to do?
[1:41:39.780 --> 1:41:44.540]  Yeah, well, folks need to know that I don't have a dog in the fight, as they say.
[1:41:44.540 --> 1:41:47.780]  So when I say something, it's not from some partisan position.
[1:41:47.780 --> 1:41:51.660]  I've watched her on television, and she really is uninformed.
[1:41:51.660 --> 1:41:58.260]  She knows about as much as the average soccer mom I know, and I'm not even saying she's
[1:41:58.260 --> 1:41:59.260]  a stupid person.
[1:41:59.260 --> 1:42:04.020]  She's lazy and hasn't applied herself, and she's about the stupidest sounding governor
[1:42:04.020 --> 1:42:06.020]  I've ever heard in my life.
[1:42:06.020 --> 1:42:08.780]  And I have to say, that is a big anchor on McCain.
[1:42:08.780 --> 1:42:11.020]  Yeah, it really, really is.
[1:42:11.020 --> 1:42:15.180]  I think there were a lot of people, I mean, I'll be very honest, if Hillary had succeeded
[1:42:15.180 --> 1:42:20.860]  in defeating Barack Obama, I'd be supporting McCain right now, again, on the lesser of
[1:42:20.860 --> 1:42:22.940]  several evils kind of a front.
[1:42:22.940 --> 1:42:28.780]  But the situation with Palin, when she was mayor of Wasilla, the city actually had to
[1:42:28.780 --> 1:42:35.700]  hire a professional administrator to actually do a significant part of her job for her,
[1:42:35.700 --> 1:42:40.380]  because she was that ill-equipped to be dealing with the realities of the job.
[1:42:40.380 --> 1:42:44.340]  And of course, these gaps she's been making about the role of the vice president, you
[1:42:44.340 --> 1:42:48.900]  know, she hasn't even read the job description yet after all these weeks.
[1:42:48.900 --> 1:42:54.580]  The vice president's just a little PR minion who can break a tie in the Senate, and who
[1:42:54.580 --> 1:43:00.460]  goes around to photo ops, and they literally just sit in the background in case something
[1:43:00.460 --> 1:43:01.780]  happens to the president.
[1:43:01.780 --> 1:43:04.660]  Yeah, that really is it under the Constitution.
[1:43:04.660 --> 1:43:09.660]  Now we know that Dick Cheney, of course, was playing Machiavellian games in the background
[1:43:09.660 --> 1:43:11.060]  and doing a lot of...
[1:43:11.060 --> 1:43:14.580]  Yeah, he claimed the vice president was even more powerful than the president, and a power
[1:43:14.580 --> 1:43:18.220]  unto itself separate from government.
[1:43:18.220 --> 1:43:22.740]  And it kept saying, well, I belong to this branch when you're trying to criticize me
[1:43:22.740 --> 1:43:26.340]  for what's over there, and I belong to this other branch when you're trying to...
[1:43:26.340 --> 1:43:28.500]  And then he said, I belong to no branch.
[1:43:28.500 --> 1:43:29.500]  That was the last thing.
[1:43:29.500 --> 1:43:32.980]  Yeah, that was the last time, and I think Sarah Palin basically was looking at Dick
[1:43:32.980 --> 1:43:37.020]  Cheney and figuring she's going to have the same kind of latitude and her actions.
[1:43:37.020 --> 1:43:40.620]  I don't think so, even if McCain were to win.
[1:43:40.620 --> 1:43:42.380]  Well, I'm going to tell you something.
[1:43:42.380 --> 1:43:47.660]  My gut tells me Barack Obama's going to be bad news, and it was going to be very divisive.
[1:43:47.660 --> 1:43:52.500]  It's not going to bring the country together, because now, anytime you criticize him, it's
[1:43:52.500 --> 1:43:55.340]  going to be that, well, you don't like black people.
[1:43:55.340 --> 1:43:59.580]  And the media is going to sell that line, and it's going to create more division.
[1:43:59.580 --> 1:44:03.980]  And then when the New World Order dumps all the blame on him, like you've done on George
[1:44:03.980 --> 1:44:09.620]  Bush, and these guys are puppets, then that'll create even more racial division.
[1:44:09.620 --> 1:44:11.380]  And they're going to tear Barack Obama apart.
[1:44:11.380 --> 1:44:12.620]  You just watch.
[1:44:12.620 --> 1:44:13.620]  You just watch.
[1:44:13.620 --> 1:44:18.620]  The system is going to set him up, and that's what they do.
[1:44:18.620 --> 1:44:20.460]  They blame it on the puppets.
[1:44:20.460 --> 1:44:24.100]  That's what the New World Order does, it's how they operate.
[1:44:24.100 --> 1:44:28.780]  And I mean, look, I agree with you, it's going to be Obama, because they ran a mentally ill
[1:44:28.780 --> 1:44:34.140]  person teetering on death, and they knew that Palin was an idiot.
[1:44:34.140 --> 1:44:37.260]  And they knew that was going to blow up in their face.
[1:44:37.260 --> 1:44:42.180]  And so it's just like running that corpse Bob Dole against Bill Clinton in 96.
[1:44:42.180 --> 1:44:43.700]  They are taking a dive here.
[1:44:43.700 --> 1:44:48.260]  Well, I think it doesn't matter really who wins.
[1:44:48.260 --> 1:44:51.940]  It's going to be a divisive election anyway, we're already seeing that, you know, with
[1:44:51.940 --> 1:44:55.580]  the cardboard cut out of Obama hanging in the tree, the dead bear, and now of course
[1:44:55.580 --> 1:44:59.980]  we've got this situation in Pittsburgh, where it looks like this McCain staffer faked this
[1:44:59.980 --> 1:45:04.300]  attack on herself to try and make Obama's people look bad.
[1:45:04.300 --> 1:45:10.340]  And even Fox News is saying, if this is indeed a hoax, you know, it's outright race-baiting
[1:45:10.340 --> 1:45:11.340]  here.
[1:45:11.340 --> 1:45:16.340]  By the way, I was going to say that earlier in the show, it smells bad, because it happened
[1:45:16.340 --> 1:45:22.460]  off-camera and those ATMs are so surveilled next to a mini-mart, those are surveilled.
[1:45:22.460 --> 1:45:27.060]  And the fact that she didn't want medical attention, you know, the bee is so well done
[1:45:27.060 --> 1:45:32.900]  on her cheek, like somebody on the ground, humping her, as he supposedly, you know, non-sexually,
[1:45:32.900 --> 1:45:37.780]  but you know, sexually harassing her, but she didn't want to have forensics done.
[1:45:37.780 --> 1:45:44.060]  And it just reeks of, you know, the over and over again, the black students caught, people,
[1:45:44.060 --> 1:45:45.780]  it's called false flag, folks.
[1:45:45.780 --> 1:45:50.000]  And individuals do this, not just governments, you know, where the blacks hang up images
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:54.860]  of dead blacks or put the N-word on their dorm door, or the Jewish girls keep getting
[1:45:54.860 --> 1:45:55.860]  caught doing it.
[1:45:55.860 --> 1:45:59.500]  I mean, this is a phenomenon, or the mother that gives poison to her child, because she
[1:45:59.500 --> 1:46:00.500]  likes the attention.
[1:46:00.500 --> 1:46:04.060]  Yeah, it very much is that kind of thing.
[1:46:04.060 --> 1:46:08.620]  And you know, looking at the photo of the supposed victim, and again, coming from my
[1:46:08.620 --> 1:46:13.020]  expertise and my day job here, the black eyes are definitely makeup.
[1:46:13.020 --> 1:46:17.300]  There is none of the redness to the actual eye that you would see if she'd really been
[1:46:17.300 --> 1:46:18.300]  hit.
[1:46:18.300 --> 1:46:23.300]  And it's not even a very professional-looking makeup job, especially on her right eye.
[1:46:23.300 --> 1:46:26.700]  The bee is drawn backwards, like she was looking in a mirror while she was doing it.
[1:46:26.700 --> 1:46:31.100]  And just now, Pittsburgh police have issued a statement saying there are inconsistencies
[1:46:31.100 --> 1:46:32.100]  on her story.
[1:46:32.100 --> 1:46:36.420]  She does not appear on the films at the ATM machine where she claims that she was just
[1:46:36.420 --> 1:46:37.420]  before the attack.
[1:46:37.420 --> 1:46:43.380]  W-T-A-E-T-V, police inconsistencies on the story of politely motivated attacks, so when
[1:46:43.380 --> 1:46:45.580]  the cops tell you that, they're telling you they think it's fake.
[1:46:45.580 --> 1:46:49.340]  Yeah, that's exactly, that's been brewing since last night.
[1:46:49.340 --> 1:46:53.740]  So, you know, it is a divisive campaign, and you know, the honest truth is, it doesn't
[1:46:53.740 --> 1:46:56.460]  matter who wins, there's going to be a lot of controversy.
[1:46:56.460 --> 1:47:01.220]  We may still see if Obama wins the election on November 4th, we may see McCain take it
[1:47:01.220 --> 1:47:04.740]  back to the U.S. Supreme Court and try and repeat what we saw in 2000.
[1:47:04.740 --> 1:47:10.780]  It is going to be very divisive, and you know, there's a lot of very unhappy people out there.
[1:47:10.780 --> 1:47:14.820]  You have got on one side, you've got all the people who became rich on the tax cuts for
[1:47:14.820 --> 1:47:18.700]  the rich, they want to keep those tax cuts, they want McCain to stay in there because
[1:47:18.700 --> 1:47:22.380]  they know that Barack Obama is going to change the tax structure.
[1:47:22.380 --> 1:47:25.620]  But the bottom line is, and where everybody needs to come together is we're all taxed
[1:47:25.620 --> 1:47:29.100]  way too much, and we shouldn't be arguing over whether the rich should be taxed or the
[1:47:29.100 --> 1:47:33.460]  poor should be taxed, we should join together and say we all are taxed too much, let's
[1:47:33.460 --> 1:47:34.980]  all have lower taxes.
[1:47:34.980 --> 1:47:40.780]  You know this government could fix the economy overnight by slashing taxes, 50% across the
[1:47:40.780 --> 1:47:43.420]  board, so we kept more of our money to pay off.
[1:47:43.420 --> 1:47:45.900]  Yeah, for those who don't know, it's all about control.
[1:47:45.900 --> 1:47:52.020]  When Kennedy and others cut taxes, about 50% tax income doubled, and people go, how does
[1:47:52.020 --> 1:47:53.020]  that happen?
[1:47:53.020 --> 1:47:59.300]  Because the economy goes wild, and so, and again, Mike, I don't think people make $250,000
[1:47:59.300 --> 1:48:00.300]  a year rich.
[1:48:00.300 --> 1:48:09.100]  I mean, the way the dollar's been devalued, maybe 20 years ago, but, I mean, all the
[1:48:09.100 --> 1:48:14.820]  taxes go to the Federal Reserve, and that's where the checks even go, it goes to the private
[1:48:14.820 --> 1:48:18.820]  bankers, look, what about Obama and his gun control?
[1:48:18.820 --> 1:48:22.100]  I mean, that's real, he really is an anti-gun piece of garbage.
[1:48:22.100 --> 1:48:26.860]  Well, I absolutely, I don't agree with Obama on a lot of the things he said, when he was
[1:48:26.860 --> 1:48:32.180]  first starting out, I liked what he was saying as he moved centrist in order to win the campaign.
[1:48:32.180 --> 1:48:34.380]  A lot of what he said was less and less.
[1:48:34.380 --> 1:48:38.900]  It really comes down to picking the lesser of two evils, which is a darn silly way to
[1:48:38.900 --> 1:48:43.660]  be running a country, and I don't agree with Obama, and I'll tell you, if he does win,
[1:48:43.660 --> 1:48:47.180]  I hope he's not expecting that I'm going to be treating him kindly at my website and
[1:48:47.180 --> 1:48:49.100]  my radio broadcast, because I'm not.
[1:48:49.100 --> 1:48:52.820]  This is going to be the world's shortest political honeymoon, because I'm going to be holding
[1:48:52.820 --> 1:48:57.060]  him to the fire, as intensely as anybody else that I've been doing in my website and my
[1:48:57.060 --> 1:48:58.060]  radio show.
[1:48:58.060 --> 1:49:00.260]  And they're going to call you a right-wing racist.
[1:49:00.260 --> 1:49:05.700]  Well, they've been doing that already, and they call me a Nazi, and they call me a Zionist
[1:49:05.700 --> 1:49:11.460]  stooge, and the rest of it, and I'm used to it by now, but my function there is to basically
[1:49:11.460 --> 1:49:15.900]  go on pointing out the lies and corruptions, and if Obama does not keep the promises that
[1:49:15.900 --> 1:49:20.340]  he's made, and then he's going to have a lot of trouble coming from my part of the
[1:49:20.340 --> 1:49:21.340]  internet.
[1:49:21.340 --> 1:49:25.580]  I don't see it as lesser of two evils.
[1:49:25.580 --> 1:49:30.660]  I mean, both of them are just absolutely horrible, and I do see all the big money behind Obama.
[1:49:30.660 --> 1:49:31.820]  That stinks.
[1:49:31.820 --> 1:49:37.300]  Well, right now, there's a funny thing about politics, because when Obama was first starting
[1:49:37.300 --> 1:49:40.140]  out, most of his donations were coming in from ordinary people.
[1:49:40.140 --> 1:49:44.260]  If you looked at the demographic breakdown, but now that it looks like he might win, of
[1:49:44.260 --> 1:49:47.860]  course, everybody's going to be donating to him, because they want to be ingratiated
[1:49:47.860 --> 1:49:49.740]  with the guy who's going to win.
[1:49:49.740 --> 1:49:53.700]  And if you look at the people who donated to Barack Obama, they also donated to McCain.
[1:49:53.700 --> 1:49:58.420]  They also donated to Hillary, and they're covering all their bets.
[1:49:58.420 --> 1:50:03.500]  No, no, obviously that's true, but I mean, early on, Goldman Sachs was one of his biggest
[1:50:03.500 --> 1:50:04.500]  donors.
[1:50:04.500 --> 1:50:07.500]  And they were one of McCain's biggest donors, too.
[1:50:07.500 --> 1:50:10.500]  Yeah, but they outgave four to one to Obama.
[1:50:10.500 --> 1:50:14.860]  I mean, Mike, I'm not, I mean, I know you're a big boy, you can handle somebody disagreeing
[1:50:14.860 --> 1:50:15.860]  with you.
[1:50:15.860 --> 1:50:16.860]  I'm not even so much disagreeing.
[1:50:16.860 --> 1:50:21.540]  I'm just trying to flush this out in my mind, and you know, I swore I wouldn't get involved
[1:50:21.540 --> 1:50:22.540]  in this.
[1:50:22.540 --> 1:50:27.540]  I just, it really insults our intelligence, but we're going to come back with Mike Rivera
[1:50:27.540 --> 1:50:32.580]  and talk about some other issues and take your calls.
[1:50:32.580 --> 1:50:37.140]  Cameras are everywhere, above stoplights, on toll booths, and scanning the freeways,
[1:50:37.140 --> 1:50:41.900]  just waiting to snap a photo of your license plate, only to slam you with ridiculous fines.
[1:50:41.900 --> 1:50:47.460]  In California, red light tickets are as high as $400. Spray your plate is a spray on photo
[1:50:47.460 --> 1:50:50.540]  blocker that protects against all types of cameras.
[1:50:50.540 --> 1:50:55.220]  Spray your plate photo blocker spray reflects and protects against flash photo images making
[1:50:55.220 --> 1:50:56.900]  your plate unreadable.
[1:50:56.900 --> 1:51:02.020]  One can of photo blocker will pay for itself many times over, last forever, and is completely
[1:51:02.020 --> 1:51:03.020]  undetectable.
[1:51:03.020 --> 1:51:07.220]  You cannot afford to not be protected with spray your plate photo blocker.

[1:51:29.020 --> 1:51:31.220]  Don't give your money to the state. Spray your plate.
[1:51:31.220 --> 1:51:38.220]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11
[1:51:38.220 --> 1:51:39.220]  was an inside job.
[1:51:39.220 --> 1:51:42.220]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:51:42.220 --> 1:51:46.620]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was the state. It was engineered by you, David
[1:51:46.620 --> 1:51:49.220]  Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A. for Army.
[1:51:49.220 --> 1:51:56.220]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[1:51:56.220 --> 1:51:58.220]  to grow at our own door.
[1:51:58.220 --> 1:52:03.220]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:52:03.220 --> 1:52:08.220]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:52:08.220 --> 1:52:14.220]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:52:14.220 --> 1:52:17.220]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:52:17.220 --> 1:52:21.220]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th
[1:52:21.220 --> 1:52:23.220]  anniversary of 9-11.
[1:52:23.220 --> 1:52:30.220]  Thank you very much.
[1:52:53.220 --> 1:52:58.220]  It is defensible and is put together with a realistic understanding of what the dangers
[1:52:58.220 --> 1:52:59.220]  will be.
[1:52:59.220 --> 1:53:02.220]  Ragnar Benson also said, why retreat?
[1:53:02.220 --> 1:53:06.220]  This is a question that 90% of our population cannot and will not answer.
[1:53:06.220 --> 1:53:11.220]  If they could, that same 90% would have to admit that things may not continue on as they
[1:53:11.220 --> 1:53:12.220]  are now.
[1:53:12.220 --> 1:53:16.220]  They would also have to admit that they will need a retreat, something completely impossible
[1:53:16.220 --> 1:53:18.220]  for the average American to do.

[1:53:36.220 --> 1:53:38.220]  Mike Rivera is our guest for this segment and the next.
[1:53:38.220 --> 1:53:40.220]  I'm going to go to your phone calls here in a moment.
[1:53:40.220 --> 1:53:43.220]  And then we've got Bob Chapman joining us for the rest of the next hour.
[1:53:43.220 --> 1:53:47.220]  We're going to know what's happening with the stock markets worldwide plunging today.
[1:53:47.220 --> 1:53:51.220]  How bad this economic collapse is going to get.
[1:53:51.220 --> 1:53:54.220]  Don't forget, Jesse Ventura is flying in tomorrow night.
[1:53:54.220 --> 1:53:55.220]  I'm picking him up.
[1:53:55.220 --> 1:53:58.220]  And then we're going to have Willie's place do some interviews.
[1:53:58.220 --> 1:54:00.220]  And then tomorrow, I'm going to give a speech.
[1:54:00.220 --> 1:54:05.220]  Willie Nelson, former governor of Jesse Ventura.
[1:54:05.220 --> 1:54:07.220]  We're about probably about 40 minutes total.
[1:54:07.220 --> 1:54:10.220]  And then about 9 p.m. central.
[1:54:10.220 --> 1:54:13.220]  And then you're going to see Willie Nelson play for about two hours.
[1:54:13.220 --> 1:54:18.220]  Willie wanted to put it out for free on the web, so we'll have those links up on infowars.com
[1:54:18.220 --> 1:54:20.220]  and prisonplanet.com.
[1:54:20.220 --> 1:54:22.220]  People can grab the link on the page.
[1:54:22.220 --> 1:54:26.220]  The player, anybody that wants to post it on their website tomorrow.
[1:54:26.220 --> 1:54:31.220]  Just be sure you let folks know that we're supposed to start speaking 9.15, 9.30.
[1:54:31.220 --> 1:54:34.220]  But you never know how these things go.
[1:54:34.220 --> 1:54:37.220]  But we'll fire the cameras a little bit early and I'll say something for the camera.
[1:54:37.220 --> 1:54:40.220]  So it just started around 9 p.m. tomorrow.
[1:54:40.220 --> 1:54:44.220]  Mike, the system knew.
[1:54:44.220 --> 1:54:46.220]  You can look at this two ways.
[1:54:46.220 --> 1:54:49.220]  The system knew.
[1:54:49.220 --> 1:54:51.220]  And they're not idiots.
[1:54:51.220 --> 1:54:54.220]  The social controllers, they know what they're doing.
[1:54:54.220 --> 1:54:56.220]  They're not slouches.
[1:54:56.220 --> 1:55:05.220]  They knew that by pushing McCain and the media in the Republican primaries that he was a dead horse.
[1:55:05.220 --> 1:55:10.220]  A bunch of the other candidates would have been much politically sexier or whatever,
[1:55:10.220 --> 1:55:14.220]  more palatable to larger groups, more presidential in their bearing.
[1:55:14.220 --> 1:55:18.220]  And so you can look at that two ways.
[1:55:18.220 --> 1:55:22.220]  The system's sick of Bush and wants to make sure his power structure's out.
[1:55:22.220 --> 1:55:24.220]  The system's good.
[1:55:24.220 --> 1:55:27.220]  It does want change and the less controlling Obama.
[1:55:27.220 --> 1:55:31.220]  Or you can look at that and say, oh no, that they know Obama's really their man.
[1:55:31.220 --> 1:55:34.220]  And so they're throwing the election for him.
[1:55:34.220 --> 1:55:38.220]  Well, I have a different view than you do.
[1:55:38.220 --> 1:55:41.220]  And it doesn't mean I'm right and you're wrong or the converse either.
[1:55:41.220 --> 1:55:43.220]  But it's simply a different perspective.
[1:55:43.220 --> 1:55:50.220]  And that is that the people who are trying to control our society aren't able to do it 100% of the time.
[1:55:50.220 --> 1:55:59.220]  And so my opinion is that McCain was promoted as the GOP candidate in the expectation that Hillary was going to succeed
[1:55:59.220 --> 1:56:05.220]  in becoming the Democratic candidate because I think a lot of people would have voted for McCain over Hillary.
[1:56:05.220 --> 1:56:07.220]  I'm one of them.
[1:56:07.220 --> 1:56:12.220]  And I think there was so much attention being focused on keeping Ron Paul out of the race
[1:56:12.220 --> 1:56:17.220]  that they weren't paying as much attention to Barack Obama as they might otherwise.
[1:56:17.220 --> 1:56:20.220]  Well, I agree. Hillary was the apparent.
[1:56:20.220 --> 1:56:24.220]  She was getting all the money. She had the neocons raising her money.
[1:56:24.220 --> 1:56:27.220]  I mean, that's who they believe was going to be in there.
[1:56:27.220 --> 1:56:29.220]  They're going to have internal documents.
[1:56:29.220 --> 1:56:33.220]  But what about Joe Biden? I mean, he's clearly involved in the 9-11 attacks.
[1:56:33.220 --> 1:56:38.220]  Well, you know, unfortunately in our government, you're going to have to go a really, really long way
[1:56:38.220 --> 1:56:42.220]  to find somebody who's not tainted by one of these cover-ups and deceptions.
[1:56:42.220 --> 1:56:46.220]  And ultimately they're all inside to some extent or another.
[1:56:46.220 --> 1:56:51.220]  So, you know, I would love a perfect candidate like Ron Paul,
[1:56:51.220 --> 1:56:55.220]  obviously for what's going to happen here, you know, in another week and a half.
[1:56:55.220 --> 1:56:57.220]  But that is not practical.
[1:56:57.220 --> 1:57:02.220]  So, I think Biden was a much better choice for Barack Obama.
[1:57:02.220 --> 1:57:05.220]  He did surprise a lot of people.
[1:57:05.220 --> 1:57:10.220]  And ultimately he came across as much more credible than Sarah Palin.
[1:57:10.220 --> 1:57:17.220]  And again, this goes back to validating the decision-making ability of the presidential candidate.
[1:57:17.220 --> 1:57:21.220]  And ultimately, that's the president's job is to make decisions.
[1:57:21.220 --> 1:57:25.220]  If you've got a candidate who makes good, well-considered, thoughtful decisions,
[1:57:25.220 --> 1:57:30.220]  then you're going to have a president who's going to make good, careful, well-considered decisions.
[1:57:30.220 --> 1:57:35.220]  And I think one of the hallmarks we have of the last eight years is that we had a president
[1:57:35.220 --> 1:57:39.220]  who made very reckless decisions without much forethought.
[1:57:39.220 --> 1:57:45.220]  And the one I keep going back to here is that at a time when our government, our population,
[1:57:45.220 --> 1:57:48.220]  our nation as a whole, was going deeper and deeper into debt,
[1:57:48.220 --> 1:57:55.220]  the Bush administration gave tax credits to corporations to move high-paying manufacturing jobs to other countries.
[1:57:55.220 --> 1:57:58.220]  Well, we know both parties, both parties are New World Order.
[1:57:58.220 --> 1:57:59.220]  That's what I'm saying.
[1:57:59.220 --> 1:58:02.220]  I think we need to get down to the point of addressing their pack of criminals
[1:58:02.220 --> 1:58:08.220]  and just stop getting sucked into the whole flying circus that is these elections.
[1:58:08.220 --> 1:58:18.220]  Mike, stay there.
[1:58:38.220 --> 1:58:45.220]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:58:45.220 --> 1:58:52.220]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:58:52.220 --> 1:58:56.220]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:58:56.220 --> 1:59:01.220]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:59:01.220 --> 1:59:06.220]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[1:59:06.220 --> 1:59:11.220]  Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality,
[1:59:11.220 --> 1:59:15.220]  along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:59:15.220 --> 1:59:24.220]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[1:59:24.220 --> 1:59:31.220]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:31.220 --> 1:59:41.220]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:59:41.220 --> 1:59:48.220]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:48.220 --> 1:59:57.220]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:59:57.220 --> 2:00:03.220]  Michael Chapman coming up in about five minutes.
[2:00:03.220 --> 2:00:10.220]  Michael Chapman, a few calls here. Brian in Georgia, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:00:10.220 --> 2:00:13.220]  Yes, how are you doing, Alex? Good.
[2:00:13.220 --> 2:00:19.220]  I just wanted to call. I'm a first-time caller, and I just first wanted to thank you for waking me up.
[2:00:19.220 --> 2:00:24.220]  I've been asleep for a lot of years, and I just wanted to commend you for waking me up.
[2:00:24.220 --> 2:00:30.220]  I just wanted to talk about the segment that you had. I know it's kind of old and it's prior,
[2:00:30.220 --> 2:00:33.220]  but I wanted to talk about the segment you had with Tex Morris.
[2:00:33.220 --> 2:00:34.220]  Yes.
[2:00:34.220 --> 2:00:39.220]  When you guys were saying, been lied and is dead, and I continued to hear some of your calls,
[2:00:39.220 --> 2:00:46.220]  and even you at times refer to him as he is alive. Is he really dead?
[2:00:46.220 --> 2:00:52.220]  I've had CFR people tell me, I've had high-level government folks tell me that he died right around 9-11.
[2:00:52.220 --> 2:00:57.220]  Oh, okay. And I just have one more question for you.
[2:00:57.220 --> 2:01:04.220]  I know this is extremely old, but I love your opinions and I love your views on certain things.
[2:01:04.220 --> 2:01:09.220]  Have you ever heard of the National Press Club? I'm pretty sure you have.
[2:01:09.220 --> 2:01:10.220]  The National Press Club?
[2:01:10.220 --> 2:01:11.220]  Yes.
[2:01:11.220 --> 2:01:12.220]  Sure.
[2:01:12.220 --> 2:01:22.220]  I watched an interview, I don't know what you think about this, but pretty much talking about UFOs,
[2:01:22.220 --> 2:01:26.220]  and they had high military people and doctors and even high-time lawyers on there giving their opinions,
[2:01:26.220 --> 2:01:31.220]  and this was back in 2001. I just wondered why something so important like that,
[2:01:31.220 --> 2:01:35.220]  because they said that they wanted to reveal it to the American people.
[2:01:35.220 --> 2:01:39.220]  Why do you think that it just never really came out and it really got through?
[2:01:39.220 --> 2:01:45.220]  That's part, I believe, and not all the players involved in the deception, they're useful idiots.
[2:01:45.220 --> 2:01:47.220]  That's part of a larger deception.
[2:01:47.220 --> 2:01:53.220]  There's a government program to introduce extra-tracks for the public to sell us that we're about to be visited.
[2:01:53.220 --> 2:02:00.220]  I'm not doubting there is another life in the universe, but everything the government's done
[2:02:00.220 --> 2:02:03.220]  has attempted to act like they're hiding something.
[2:02:03.220 --> 2:02:06.220]  Well, let's get Mike Rivera's take on that.
[2:02:06.220 --> 2:02:11.220]  Well, I'm in agreement with you, Alex.
[2:02:11.220 --> 2:02:14.220]  There's probably a lot of intelligent life out there.
[2:02:14.220 --> 2:02:17.220]  The cost to get here is prohibitive.
[2:02:17.220 --> 2:02:22.220]  I know that back during the 1950s, just to put a little historical perspective on this,
[2:02:22.220 --> 2:02:26.220]  the US government actually found this isolated town out in New Mexico,
[2:02:26.220 --> 2:02:35.220]  and they staged an experiment where they basically took control of all the TV and telephone and radio going into this town,
[2:02:35.220 --> 2:02:39.220]  and sort of did another version of War of the Worlds.
[2:02:39.220 --> 2:02:44.220]  Remember when Orson Welles did the Mercury Theater of the Air broadcast and scared everybody?
[2:02:44.220 --> 2:02:49.220]  Well, the US government basically followed up and they convinced this town aliens really had landed
[2:02:49.220 --> 2:02:51.220]  just to see what their reaction would be.
[2:02:51.220 --> 2:02:59.220]  And so this kind of presentation of a potential threat from outer space has been played with before.
[2:02:59.220 --> 2:03:06.220]  And I know a lot of people were speculating that because of all the suspicions surrounding 9-11
[2:03:06.220 --> 2:03:12.220]  and all the suspicions voiced about new Spanish flu and bird flu and the rest of it,
[2:03:12.220 --> 2:03:17.220]  that if the US government was going to try a new false flag to try and scare all of America
[2:03:17.220 --> 2:03:21.220]  to unite behind the government, or possibly even a one-world government,
[2:03:21.220 --> 2:03:26.220]  was to fake an attack or a threat from outer space.
[2:03:26.220 --> 2:03:30.220]  Yeah, that's right. Some of that has been declassified.
[2:03:30.220 --> 2:03:35.220]  Decades ago they were planning that and it's definitely in the cards, folks.
[2:03:35.220 --> 2:03:42.220]  Well, you know, it's oddly enough in the original Outer Limits TV series back in the early 60s,
[2:03:42.220 --> 2:03:44.220]  late 50s, I don't even remember when it was.
[2:03:44.220 --> 2:03:49.220]  There was actually an episode where this group of government scientists got this volunteer
[2:03:49.220 --> 2:03:55.220]  and they mutated him chemically and changed him into this alien life form,
[2:03:55.220 --> 2:03:57.220]  put him in a spaceship that they had custom built.
[2:03:57.220 --> 2:04:00.220]  They were going to have him land in Washington, D.C. and say,
[2:04:00.220 --> 2:04:05.220]  we're here to take over and that this would unite the whole world under a global government.
[2:04:05.220 --> 2:04:10.220]  So this is an idea that's been around for a while and, you know, desperate people plan desperate things.
[2:04:10.220 --> 2:04:11.220]  That's all I can say.
[2:04:11.220 --> 2:04:14.220]  I know they've done other hoaxes. Thank you for the call, Shane.
[2:04:14.220 --> 2:04:18.220]  Hey, Mike, I want to get you to pop in next week as we come in close to the election
[2:04:18.220 --> 2:04:21.220]  and then, obviously, in the post-election reportage.
[2:04:21.220 --> 2:04:22.220]  Thanks for coming on.
[2:04:22.220 --> 2:04:24.220]  You've got to talk to you soon.
[2:04:24.220 --> 2:04:25.220]  Take care.
[2:04:25.220 --> 2:04:54.220]  We'll be right back with Bob Chapman. More of your phone calls and a ton of news. Stay with me.
[2:04:55.220 --> 2:04:58.220]  They must control two things to seize total power.
[2:05:25.220 --> 2:05:53.220]  We have a short timeframe to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:05:53.220 --> 2:06:19.220]  We have a short timeframe to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:06:19.220 --> 2:06:45.220]  We have a short timeframe to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:06:45.220 --> 2:07:14.220]  We have a short timeframe to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:07:14.220 --> 2:07:43.220]  We have a short timeframe to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:07:43.220 --> 2:07:54.220]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:07:54.220 --> 2:08:00.220]  That's right. Sunday on the Sunday show from 4 to 6 p.m. Central, we'll be back.
[2:08:00.220 --> 2:08:06.220]  And I might show up within Turra and do an hour or two of that show.
[2:08:06.220 --> 2:08:12.220]  But I know he'll do it if I want to, but we're probably going to be still out at Willys and going to the event.
[2:08:12.220 --> 2:08:17.220]  We've got a best-up lined up with the Willie Nelson interview this week and the Jesse Ventura interview and a little bit of other stuff.
[2:08:17.220 --> 2:08:27.220]  So right now, I'm going to, I'm just so busy today and tomorrow, I'm going to go ahead live on air and cut an end of the show promo here for everybody.
[2:08:27.220 --> 2:08:32.220]  Hey, folks, I hope that you have enjoyed this best of Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura.
[2:08:32.220 --> 2:08:39.220]  We're all meeting up tonight out at the Historic Backyard Ample Theater.
[2:08:39.220 --> 2:08:44.220]  I don't like that one. I want to start over. You know, whenever I'm live, I can do stuff a lot better.
[2:08:44.220 --> 2:08:53.220]  And then I'm live right now that I feel like I'm recording a tape so then I have that built-in thing that I can screw up and I can't screw up.
[2:08:53.220 --> 2:09:04.220]  You know, I screwed up. I was thinking about the, I was thinking about its full name. It's the Backyard Live Oak Ample Theater.
[2:09:04.220 --> 2:09:07.220]  So let me go ahead and just get this done.
[2:09:07.220 --> 2:09:13.220]  Hey, folks, thanks for tuning in today to this best of with Governor Jesse Ventura and of course Willie Nelson.
[2:09:13.220 --> 2:09:18.220]  We're all meeting up tonight out at the Historic Backyard Live Oak Ample Theater.
[2:09:18.220 --> 2:09:23.220]  I'm going to give a speech so Willie and Jesse Ventura will take questions and answers from the crowd.
[2:09:23.220 --> 2:09:32.220]  And then Willie and the gang are going to play into the wee hours of the morning and it's all going to be streamed live and free on the Internet.
[2:09:32.220 --> 2:09:41.220]  Thanks to Willie starting at about 9-9-15 tonight at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[2:09:41.220 --> 2:09:44.220]  And again, that's all thanks to Willie. That was his idea to do that.
[2:09:44.220 --> 2:09:48.220]  So a free show for those that can't be there at the event.
[2:09:48.220 --> 2:09:57.220]  It's an anti-war slash 9-11 truth part of the overall historic final performances at the backyard.
[2:09:57.220 --> 2:10:01.220]  They're moving on an even bigger venue after close to three decades out there.
[2:10:01.220 --> 2:10:04.220]  So again, thanks for tuning in today, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:10:04.220 --> 2:10:12.220]  This transmission is now over and I'll see you on the web for the free video cast of our speeches and Willie and the gang performing.
[2:10:12.220 --> 2:10:15.220]  So see you on the web. Take care.
[2:10:15.220 --> 2:10:17.220]  Is that okay?
[2:10:17.220 --> 2:10:20.220]  All right, we're done.
[2:10:20.220 --> 2:10:24.220]  Now let's go to...
[2:10:24.220 --> 2:10:29.220]  You know what's happening. I keep doing shows now behind the scenes and radio during the breaks and the video.
[2:10:29.220 --> 2:10:35.220]  And I'm not knowing when radio's ending and when it's beginning and it's all getting crazy.
[2:10:35.220 --> 2:10:40.220]  I see some quizzical looks going on in there. What's going on?
[2:10:40.220 --> 2:10:42.220]  Everything good?
[2:10:42.220 --> 2:10:47.220]  All right, without further ado, let me reset, reassess and launch.
[2:10:47.220 --> 2:10:53.220]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, and we have Bob Chapman, the international forecaster.com with us.
[2:10:53.220 --> 2:11:00.220]  At one time, the largest gold and silver broker in the world had the largest newsletter in the world.
[2:11:00.220 --> 2:11:05.220]  Then he retired, came back, I don't know, many years ago now, now one of the biggest again.
[2:11:05.220 --> 2:11:10.220]  He's one of the most sought after radio interviews, in-talk radio for financial news and information.
[2:11:10.220 --> 2:11:17.220]  And for the rest of the hour, we are joined by Bob Chapman with the markets down close to 400 points today.
[2:11:17.220 --> 2:11:24.220]  With panic setting in, I thought we would get Bob Chapman's analysis on that. Bob, thanks for being here.
[2:11:24.220 --> 2:11:27.220]  Well, thank you for having me again.
[2:11:27.220 --> 2:11:31.220]  Look, here's my question out of the gates. I want to cover what's happening currently,
[2:11:31.220 --> 2:11:35.220]  but that's only, as you know, a small microcosm of the larger issue.
[2:11:35.220 --> 2:11:42.220]  Can you explain in layman's terms for the listeners how we're having hyperstag inflation begin
[2:11:42.220 --> 2:11:48.220]  and what stag inflation is going to mean in the future? Because people get confused. They go, well, they say it's a depression in the economy
[2:11:48.220 --> 2:11:56.220]  with markets contracting, jobs contracting, less things being purchased, commodities dropping,
[2:11:56.220 --> 2:12:02.220]  you know, credit being cut off, liquidity being cut off, people liquidating in the markets to get cash,
[2:12:02.220 --> 2:12:09.220]  to be able to cover other debts they have. That's a depression in Main Street and on the farm and in the industry and corporations.
[2:12:09.220 --> 2:12:15.220]  But for the small intergroup of central banks who have announced they're setting up this new world government banking system
[2:12:15.220 --> 2:12:21.220]  and a trilateral money system, as you and others said they would do decades ago, so that's another issue entirely.
[2:12:21.220 --> 2:12:27.220]  So they are giving themselves tons of liquidity, capital, cash, you know, they claim it's for the public,
[2:12:27.220 --> 2:12:32.220]  but really they now admit they're hoarding it all themselves while cutting off money to the economy,
[2:12:32.220 --> 2:12:41.220]  which now even business we can manage to consolidate the world market so they can then suck it up and consolidate it.
[2:12:41.220 --> 2:12:56.220]  So how depression works with an overlay of hyperinflation, how we can have inflation while in the short time we're seeing prices deflate
[2:12:56.220 --> 2:13:04.220]  because of the depressionary elements fitting in people. I mean, it seems simple to me, but can you put it in layman's terms?
[2:13:04.220 --> 2:13:14.220]  Well, we're having deflation and inflation at the same time. It's been going on in the United States for four and a half years.
[2:13:14.220 --> 2:13:21.220]  During that period of time, they took the money supply, which used to be called M3, up to a plus 17%,
[2:13:21.220 --> 2:13:26.220]  now it's running around 13 and a half to 14%, it's come down a little bit.
[2:13:26.220 --> 2:13:31.220]  But at the same time, they're injecting piles of money into the economy.
[2:13:31.220 --> 2:13:39.220]  Now, what's happening is assets are losing value, some of them are losing total value.
[2:13:39.220 --> 2:13:49.220]  The economy is slowing down and in order to keep the economy from being devoured by deflation,
[2:13:49.220 --> 2:13:58.220]  they have come out and said that the U.S. taxpayer is going to supply trillions of dollars to keep that from happening.
[2:13:58.220 --> 2:14:08.220]  And so they're injecting all of this money, credit, into the system to neutralize the deflation.
[2:14:08.220 --> 2:14:18.220]  Now, we've had a hiatus here of a couple of months and we'll probably get three or four more where prices are swinging down.
[2:14:18.220 --> 2:14:28.220]  And then all of a sudden, what's going to happen is that the money and credit being put into the economy is going to become monetized.
[2:14:28.220 --> 2:14:33.220]  And of course, Bernanke says that can't happen and he's not telling the truth.
[2:14:33.220 --> 2:14:39.220]  And so what happens is that inflation comes back only bigger and better.
[2:14:39.220 --> 2:14:46.220]  And the price of oil and the energy and the commodities and the gold and silver go back up again.
[2:14:46.220 --> 2:14:54.220]  And at the same time, what they're doing, they're keeping a very strong dollar, which shouldn't last too much longer.
[2:14:54.220 --> 2:15:00.220]  And they're essentially depressing all the markets in the world.
[2:15:00.220 --> 2:15:06.220]  Now, with the stock markets, they're trying to bring them down slowly.
[2:15:06.220 --> 2:15:13.220]  Right now, the Dow is 83.11, the industrial is around 3.80.
[2:15:13.220 --> 2:15:22.220]  They want to bring it down, I think, to support, which is experienced in 002 on the Dow of 72.86.
[2:15:22.220 --> 2:15:30.220]  When they get it there, when they get gold and silver and oil and everything else where they want it, they're going to run the markets back up again.
[2:15:30.220 --> 2:15:41.220]  And that's going to give the banks that much more liquidity because they'll make a pile of money by pulling this on the public.
[2:15:41.220 --> 2:15:54.220]  So in that time frame, what will also happen is that the money spigots at the banks and other kinds of lenders will start to open slowly.
[2:15:54.220 --> 2:15:59.220]  And then when they make all that money, they'll be able to lend it out.
[2:15:59.220 --> 2:16:04.220]  And this is what they intend to do to keep this going for two or three more years.
[2:16:04.220 --> 2:16:13.220]  They'll call Craig Roberts and I said earlier, they'll come back and try to do this again and again until the system collapses.
[2:16:13.220 --> 2:16:19.220]  Now, you talk about them finally putting some liquidity out, but when I read in Business Week and I was shocked,
[2:16:19.220 --> 2:16:23.220]  they were telling the truth that really a few central banks are getting even more power and control out of this.
[2:16:23.220 --> 2:16:29.220]  Financial Times of London has been repeating that lately, not just a few years ago again.
[2:16:29.220 --> 2:16:38.220]  I see a cold-blooded move where they just may keep credit liquidity shut down and just hoard it up for themselves and maybe accelerate the implosion faster
[2:16:38.220 --> 2:16:45.220]  so they can consolidate because they now know there's no way to ever, you know, basically prop it up indefinitely.
[2:16:45.220 --> 2:16:51.220]  A very possible situation. You're right, it could happen that way.
[2:16:51.220 --> 2:16:58.220]  But their history has been that they've always tried to delay and extend.
[2:16:58.220 --> 2:17:05.220]  Now, there's going to come a time within their time frame for world government that they're going to say,
[2:17:05.220 --> 2:17:10.220]  okay, this is it. This is the day. We're going to pull a plug on everything.
[2:17:10.220 --> 2:17:14.220]  And we don't know when that is and that will happen.
[2:17:14.220 --> 2:17:26.220]  But if history is any guide, it's somewhere out there in a couple of years or as long as they can extend it or until it fits into the proper program perspective
[2:17:26.220 --> 2:17:30.220]  that they want to bring us all financially to our knees.
[2:17:30.220 --> 2:17:35.220]  And that's their stated goal. For those that are tuning in and all these guys just tell you, that's their opinion. Everybody's got one.
[2:17:35.220 --> 2:17:42.220]  This is stated and exactly the Liberals all think Northcom is about to declare martial law next week.
[2:17:42.220 --> 2:17:52.220]  No, they're just getting you acclimated, domesticated, trained, accustomed to seeing the troops and the police merging
[2:17:52.220 --> 2:17:57.220]  and the watch list and the secret arrest and the torture.
[2:17:57.220 --> 2:18:01.220]  And then, oh, a new president that they're admitting under Obama or McCain.
[2:18:01.220 --> 2:18:05.220]  Everything's going to intensify. It's not going to abate. It's going to get worse.
[2:18:05.220 --> 2:18:11.220]  And so it's this slow, dark march into night, which they know is the sure path for total domination.
[2:18:11.220 --> 2:18:20.220]  But as you said, then finally, the name of fixing this crisis, setting up open world government, open carbon tax purchases
[2:18:20.220 --> 2:18:28.220]  from the private intergroup of banks, open control over world markets and currencies by them under three subsections.
[2:18:28.220 --> 2:18:34.220]  American Union, the core, European Union, the core, Asian Union, the core with seven subdirectorates.
[2:18:34.220 --> 2:18:40.220]  Everything you warned people about 20, 30 years ago, everything the trilateral commission said they do 30 years ago,
[2:18:40.220 --> 2:18:43.220]  everything that has been on record.
[2:18:43.220 --> 2:18:51.220]  But we're here now. What was it like for you, Bob, the last few weeks to see them just openly announce all this?
[2:18:51.220 --> 2:19:03.220]  Well, I was shocked. And I was also shocked because in 49 years of being in and around business and particularly gold and silver and hard money,
[2:19:03.220 --> 2:19:09.220]  I was really shocked the way they took gold down. They were aided by deleveraging.
[2:19:09.220 --> 2:19:14.220]  But quite frankly, I was caught totally off guard. And I think most everybody else was.
[2:19:14.220 --> 2:19:21.220]  I can only remember two blues letter writers that said something like this might happen, other than that there was nobody.
[2:19:21.220 --> 2:19:27.220]  Stay there. Stay there. Well, I mean, they really threw us a curveball. You know who did say it? Lindsay Williams.
[2:19:27.220 --> 2:19:32.220]  He had that inside corporate source. Stay there. We'll talk about that.
[2:19:32.220 --> 2:19:39.220]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:19:39.220 --> 2:19:43.220]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:19:43.220 --> 2:19:45.220]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[2:19:45.220 --> 2:19:48.220]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:19:48.220 --> 2:19:55.220]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:19:55.220 --> 2:20:02.220]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:20:02.220 --> 2:20:06.220]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:20:06.220 --> 2:20:13.220]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:20:13.220 --> 2:20:17.220]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies.

[2:23:44.220 --> 2:23:51.220]  I've been interviewing Bob Chapman. I don't know, it's like 2000.
[2:23:51.220 --> 2:23:57.220]  And I have never seen Bob be wrong. Now, he advertises he's been wrong in his newsletter.
[2:23:57.220 --> 2:24:04.220]  That's why he says about 95% accurate. And you say you were blindsided.
[2:24:04.220 --> 2:24:07.220]  And that's the thing about the New World Order. They could release bird flu next week.
[2:24:07.220 --> 2:24:12.220]  They could have a fake alien landing next month. They could stage a new terror attack.
[2:24:12.220 --> 2:24:15.220]  Or they could fund a real terrorist group. Or they could sneak attack Russia.
[2:24:15.220 --> 2:24:20.220]  You know, we all woke up and they were sneaking attack in Russia through their George and Proxy.
[2:24:20.220 --> 2:24:25.220]  I mean, you know, these guys are slick. I mean, that's why they're in control of the planet.
[2:24:25.220 --> 2:24:31.220]  And they can pull all sorts of stuff. Bob, continue.
[2:24:31.220 --> 2:24:40.220]  Well, I think that people should be aware that there has been a split market in gold and silver.
[2:24:40.220 --> 2:24:49.220]  The physical market has been tremendously under pressure. There's virtually no inventory worldwide.
[2:24:49.220 --> 2:24:53.220]  There are some things that are for sale, numismatic coins.
[2:24:53.220 --> 2:25:00.220]  But, you know, your last ten years, you know, getting inventory, getting product is not easy.
[2:25:00.220 --> 2:25:05.220]  At the same time, we've had gold come down like a bomb.
[2:25:05.220 --> 2:25:11.220]  I talked to a gold trader in Paris a few days ago.
[2:25:11.220 --> 2:25:18.220]  And he told me that the U.S. was selling gold via Israel.
[2:25:18.220 --> 2:25:27.220]  And then I was told by another dealer that the delivery that they're making is coming, you know, against their sale contracts that they've made,
[2:25:27.220 --> 2:25:32.220]  is coming from other nations in the form of coin mount.
[2:25:32.220 --> 2:25:40.220]  And the only entity in the world that I know of that has coin melt is the United States government from the 1930s.
[2:25:40.220 --> 2:25:51.220]  And so what they did is they swapped coin melt, which is not good delivery, for good delivery previously over the last nine months or so.
[2:25:51.220 --> 2:25:55.220]  Okay, explain all these terms people that don't know. Coin melt, good delivery.
[2:25:55.220 --> 2:25:58.220]  I mean, bottom line, this is a totally rigged market.
[2:25:58.220 --> 2:26:07.220]  But we'll say it's about 90 to 92 percent because there's other alloys in there that give coins hardness.
[2:26:07.220 --> 2:26:10.220]  Good delivery varies from where you're going to get it from.
[2:26:10.220 --> 2:26:20.220]  It could be 99.5, 99.9, or 100 percent. It all depends.
[2:26:20.220 --> 2:26:22.220]  That's good delivery generally speaking.
[2:26:22.220 --> 2:26:33.220]  Yeah, they're selling mass melted gold that they confiscated in the 30s and then somehow pushing that out on the gold bar market.
[2:26:33.220 --> 2:26:38.220]  That's correct. It has to be re-refined, but they had to have done this before.
[2:26:38.220 --> 2:26:49.220]  In other words, made the swaps with people who had good delivery and took that into the market before good delivery before
[2:26:49.220 --> 2:26:52.220]  so that people wouldn't know what they were doing.
[2:26:52.220 --> 2:26:59.220]  Now the people who took this gold and gave good delivery, let's say Germany,
[2:26:59.220 --> 2:27:05.220]  is sitting with a bunch of gold that's not good delivery but has to now be delivered.
[2:27:05.220 --> 2:27:09.220]  So what they're doing is going to get exposed. They were the seller.
[2:27:09.220 --> 2:27:14.220]  They were other sellers too. I don't know who they were, but I know that the U.S. was a big seller.
[2:27:14.220 --> 2:27:19.220]  But can't they look at those, I mean, didn't Germany look at those gold bars?
[2:27:19.220 --> 2:27:24.220]  You can tell by the color if it's 99.9999 or if it's a coin mill.
[2:27:24.220 --> 2:27:27.220]  Yeah, but they were told up front.
[2:27:27.220 --> 2:27:32.220]  They accommodated the U.S. government and others who did the same thing.
[2:27:32.220 --> 2:27:36.220]  Now let's explain. We're not saying coins are bad. It's just two different things.
[2:27:36.220 --> 2:27:39.220]  Like if you have a Krugerrand, it's over an ounce total weight.
[2:27:39.220 --> 2:27:46.220]  It just is guaranteed to have an ounce of gold or a Mexican peso or a maple leaf or anything else.
[2:27:46.220 --> 2:27:52.220]  A coin adds some other alloy because pure gold is so soft.
[2:27:52.220 --> 2:27:59.220]  So coins have, in fact, per coin more value than actually something that's been melted down and totally pure.
[2:27:59.220 --> 2:28:04.220]  It's just that to sell it in these big bank transfers they have, country to country,
[2:28:04.220 --> 2:28:07.220]  in the giant paper markets, I'm trying to simplify this, Bob.
[2:28:07.220 --> 2:28:11.220]  I'm wrong. They sold a bunch of bars.
[2:28:11.220 --> 2:28:15.220]  Or are you saying it was just giant buckets of coin?
[2:28:15.220 --> 2:28:18.220]  No, I think they were probably bars.
[2:28:18.220 --> 2:28:24.220]  And they were just the product of coin melt that they never bothered to refine.
[2:28:24.220 --> 2:28:29.220]  So the U.S. is dumping massive reserves in the market to try to drive it down.
[2:28:29.220 --> 2:28:35.220]  That's a bottom line. And of course they were aided by the liquidation,
[2:28:35.220 --> 2:28:41.220]  which is caused, being caused by deleveraging by pension and profit sharing plans
[2:28:41.220 --> 2:28:44.220]  of the speculators and particularly hedge funds.
[2:28:44.220 --> 2:28:49.220]  I mean, I've never seen them throw the baby out with the bathwater like this.
[2:28:49.220 --> 2:28:53.220]  It wasn't only gold and silver. It was all a commodity.
[2:28:53.220 --> 2:28:54.220]  Oil.
[2:28:54.220 --> 2:28:57.220]  Yeah, no, they were crazy.
[2:28:57.220 --> 2:29:00.220]  Well, I mean, everybody got hit here except the dollar.
[2:29:00.220 --> 2:29:05.220]  Well, and really the dollar hasn't gained all the other currencies are dropping.
[2:29:05.220 --> 2:29:06.220]  That's right.
[2:29:06.220 --> 2:29:10.220]  So it's unified, strategic, controlled worldwide inflation,
[2:29:10.220 --> 2:29:15.220]  while they blow out the bottom in the real economy commodities.
[2:29:15.220 --> 2:29:19.220]  I mean, this is being done with precision. Stay there, Bob Chapman.
[2:29:22.220 --> 2:29:26.220]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[2:29:26.220 --> 2:29:30.220]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:32.220 --> 2:29:36.220]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[2:29:36.220 --> 2:29:39.220]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[2:29:39.220 --> 2:29:41.220]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[2:29:41.220 --> 2:29:44.220]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate
[2:29:44.220 --> 2:29:46.220]  and others are absorbed into the skin.
[2:29:46.220 --> 2:29:50.220]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water
[2:29:50.220 --> 2:29:54.220]  and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron,
[2:29:54.220 --> 2:29:58.220]  inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[2:29:58.220 --> 2:30:02.220]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons
[2:30:02.220 --> 2:30:04.220]  or one year whichever comes first.
[2:30:04.220 --> 2:30:07.220]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media
[2:30:07.220 --> 2:30:10.220]  to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[2:30:10.220 --> 2:30:11.220]  What about you?

[2:30:30.220 --> 2:30:36.220]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[2:30:36.220 --> 2:30:39.220]  I went to grounds here and we knew what to do.
[2:30:39.220 --> 2:30:41.220]  Or at least we thought we did.
[2:30:41.220 --> 2:30:43.220]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[2:30:43.220 --> 2:30:47.220]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[2:30:47.220 --> 2:30:53.220]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18 made a statement
[2:30:53.220 --> 2:30:56.220]  that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:30:56.220 --> 2:30:59.220]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth
[2:30:59.220 --> 2:31:03.220]  as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[2:31:03.220 --> 2:31:07.220]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:31:07.220 --> 2:31:12.220]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[2:32:32.220 --> 2:32:36.220]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[2:32:36.220 --> 2:32:41.220]  The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:32:51.220 --> 2:32:54.220]  You know Bob, I've just studied the basics of economics
[2:32:54.220 --> 2:32:57.220]  and if they're printing money like it's going on style
[2:32:59.220 --> 2:33:03.220]  and then trying to send it overseas while causing a worldwide depression
[2:33:03.220 --> 2:33:07.220]  and a real economy, I mean it's the perfect storm.
[2:33:07.220 --> 2:33:11.220]  Have we ever seen depression overlaid with hyperinflation
[2:33:11.220 --> 2:33:14.220]  and what will that look like?
[2:33:14.220 --> 2:33:16.220]  I mean, break down the basics.
[2:33:16.220 --> 2:33:19.220]  Well, I mean, let's finish up with this big gold racket
[2:33:19.220 --> 2:33:21.220]  and it's like holding a beach ball under water.
[2:33:21.220 --> 2:33:24.220]  What happens when it finally explodes or can they just forever?
[2:33:24.220 --> 2:33:29.220]  We'll have us live in a La La Land world where gold's really 150 bucks more
[2:33:29.220 --> 2:33:32.220]  than what they say and no one can get it and the ment's all shut down
[2:33:32.220 --> 2:33:36.220]  and then they say, gold is worth nothing, gold is worth five cents
[2:33:36.220 --> 2:33:40.220]  but you can't find it, I mean supply and demand, all of this.
[2:33:40.220 --> 2:33:42.220]  We're just in a total delusion world now.
[2:33:42.220 --> 2:33:44.220]  What's happening?
[2:33:44.220 --> 2:33:47.220]  Well, I think if you look at the futures market
[2:33:47.220 --> 2:33:50.220]  where the problem really lies with the manipulation
[2:33:50.220 --> 2:33:53.220]  by the United States government is very strong,
[2:33:53.220 --> 2:33:57.220]  you'll see that an awful lot more people are starting to take delivery
[2:33:57.220 --> 2:34:00.220]  of both gold and silver
[2:34:00.220 --> 2:34:03.220]  and that's got the exchanges jumping up and down
[2:34:03.220 --> 2:34:07.220]  because they don't want to lose their inventory of gold
[2:34:07.220 --> 2:34:10.220]  and the silver that they have on hand.
[2:34:10.220 --> 2:34:12.220]  And so that's what's going on
[2:34:12.220 --> 2:34:18.220]  and people are then re-refining the large bars into smaller bars
[2:34:18.220 --> 2:34:21.220]  or having them made into coins if they want
[2:34:21.220 --> 2:34:26.220]  and so this is a process that is beginning
[2:34:26.220 --> 2:34:29.220]  and I think that will continue.
[2:34:29.220 --> 2:34:32.220]  I've been told and then continue but I've got so many questions
[2:34:32.220 --> 2:34:35.220]  that the reason the US meant, the Canadian meant,
[2:34:35.220 --> 2:34:38.220]  the German, a bunch of others, the Russian are saying
[2:34:38.220 --> 2:34:41.220]  for the foreseeable future no more buffaloes, no more eagles,
[2:34:41.220 --> 2:34:44.220]  no more maple leaves, no more this and that
[2:34:44.220 --> 2:34:46.220]  because under those federal laws in those countries
[2:34:46.220 --> 2:34:48.220]  they're only allowed to buy gold
[2:34:48.220 --> 2:34:50.220]  so there's no chicanery at what spot is
[2:34:50.220 --> 2:34:52.220]  and they buy ahead for their inventory
[2:34:52.220 --> 2:34:56.220]  and that the physical amounts being actually put into market
[2:34:56.220 --> 2:34:59.220]  versus fake paper are so small they can't,
[2:34:59.220 --> 2:35:01.220]  well the Krugerrand plant shut down,
[2:35:01.220 --> 2:35:04.220]  the Krugerrand mint, they're sitting on top,
[2:35:04.220 --> 2:35:05.220]  the biggest gold reserve in the world
[2:35:05.220 --> 2:35:07.220]  where you lived on there in South Africa
[2:35:07.220 --> 2:35:10.220]  so I mean how long can, I mean specifically speak to that,
[2:35:10.220 --> 2:35:13.220]  I mean the mints are saying we're shut down
[2:35:13.220 --> 2:35:15.220]  because we can't get gold, meanwhile gold's dropping,
[2:35:15.220 --> 2:35:18.220]  I mean that shows we're in a rigged system.
[2:35:18.220 --> 2:35:21.220]  That's right and you know even Mexico
[2:35:21.220 --> 2:35:25.220]  which is the biggest producer of silver in the world
[2:35:25.220 --> 2:35:28.220]  they make a thing called the Libertad
[2:35:28.220 --> 2:35:30.220]  and they stop production
[2:35:30.220 --> 2:35:32.220]  and between now and the end of the year
[2:35:32.220 --> 2:35:34.220]  there's going to be 60,000 available
[2:35:34.220 --> 2:35:35.220]  and that's the end of it
[2:35:35.220 --> 2:35:38.220]  and they stop production of the gold coin
[2:35:38.220 --> 2:35:42.220]  which is called the sentinario
[2:35:42.220 --> 2:35:48.220]  and so these things don't happen by chance
[2:35:48.220 --> 2:35:51.220]  there is no such thing as coincidence
[2:35:51.220 --> 2:35:54.220]  this was managed from Washington
[2:35:54.220 --> 2:35:57.220]  and Washington has said look we don't want
[2:35:57.220 --> 2:36:00.220]  gold or silver coins or bars in people's hands
[2:36:00.220 --> 2:36:03.220]  we want them to stay in their currencies
[2:36:03.220 --> 2:36:06.220]  so let's not make it available
[2:36:06.220 --> 2:36:09.220]  so then the run started in Europe
[2:36:09.220 --> 2:36:14.220]  and you see the result of it today in the physical market
[2:36:14.220 --> 2:36:18.220]  That's right because the markets start plunging
[2:36:18.220 --> 2:36:20.220]  but in this hall of mirrors
[2:36:20.220 --> 2:36:23.220]  what other curve balls do you think they could throw us?
[2:36:23.220 --> 2:36:27.220]  Well I think unless France and Germany
[2:36:27.220 --> 2:36:29.220]  and Italy want to start selling gold
[2:36:29.220 --> 2:36:32.220]  because Russia and China have been buyers among others
[2:36:32.220 --> 2:36:35.220]  unless they're willing to be sellers
[2:36:35.220 --> 2:36:37.220]  the US should soon be out of gold
[2:36:37.220 --> 2:36:41.220]  because I would assume and this is only logic speaking
[2:36:41.220 --> 2:36:46.220]  that they probably get rid of all their good delivery gold
[2:36:46.220 --> 2:36:48.220]  and are now only using coin melt
[2:36:48.220 --> 2:36:50.220]  because that's all they got left
[2:36:50.220 --> 2:36:54.220]  it's a guess but they may be coming to the end
[2:36:54.220 --> 2:36:57.220]  of their supply and inventory to sell
[2:36:57.220 --> 2:36:59.220]  and if that is the case
[2:36:59.220 --> 2:37:04.220]  then it would be incumbent upon other large gold holders
[2:37:04.220 --> 2:37:07.220]  such as Germany, Italy and France to sell theirs
[2:37:07.220 --> 2:37:10.220]  on behalf of the US to keep the price down
[2:37:10.220 --> 2:37:12.220]  the Germans won't do it
[2:37:12.220 --> 2:37:14.220]  the French will do it
[2:37:14.220 --> 2:37:16.220]  the Italians have already I think
[2:37:16.220 --> 2:37:19.220]  leased most of their gold so forward
[2:37:19.220 --> 2:37:21.220]  so they may not be a factor
[2:37:21.220 --> 2:37:23.220]  so you really get two countries with gold
[2:37:23.220 --> 2:37:25.220]  France and Germany
[2:37:25.220 --> 2:37:27.220]  and I don't think Germany would be a seller
[2:37:27.220 --> 2:37:31.220]  and so with that it would have to pass the Bundestag
[2:37:31.220 --> 2:37:33.220]  and I don't think that's going to happen
[2:37:33.220 --> 2:37:36.220]  and so France could only be the seller
[2:37:36.220 --> 2:37:39.220]  and France has been a seller for the last year
[2:37:39.220 --> 2:37:41.220]  yeah that's where Terry Anderson's agreement
[2:37:41.220 --> 2:37:44.220]  I mean you know and I don't want to mention the competition
[2:37:44.220 --> 2:37:46.220]  but I go and look
[2:37:46.220 --> 2:37:48.220]  most of the other gold brokers are saying
[2:37:48.220 --> 2:37:50.220]  we're out, we don't have any
[2:37:50.220 --> 2:37:52.220]  you can only buy one coin at a time from us
[2:37:52.220 --> 2:37:54.220]  Ted is still able to get it
[2:37:54.220 --> 2:37:56.220]  and that's where he's getting a lot of it
[2:37:56.220 --> 2:37:58.220]  in fact most of it is France
[2:37:58.220 --> 2:38:02.220]  and that's why you get so many roosters
[2:38:02.220 --> 2:38:04.220]  cockadoodle do
[2:38:04.220 --> 2:38:07.220]  but anyway that's right
[2:38:07.220 --> 2:38:10.220]  I mean I talked to somebody in Buenos Aires
[2:38:10.220 --> 2:38:12.220]  yesterday
[2:38:12.220 --> 2:38:15.220]  and he said we haven't had silver for six months
[2:38:15.220 --> 2:38:18.220]  now we don't have any gold or gold coins
[2:38:18.220 --> 2:38:20.220]  and they were getting them through Montevideo
[2:38:20.220 --> 2:38:22.220]  over in Uruguay across the river Platte
[2:38:22.220 --> 2:38:25.220]  and they were getting them from Switzerland
[2:38:25.220 --> 2:38:28.220]  and I don't know whether the Swiss shut them off
[2:38:28.220 --> 2:38:32.220]  or the US government shut Uruguay off
[2:38:32.220 --> 2:38:34.220]  there's all kinds of stuff going on out there
[2:38:34.220 --> 2:38:36.220]  that we don't know about
[2:38:36.220 --> 2:38:39.220]  explain to people why it's so important to the globalists
[2:38:39.220 --> 2:38:42.220]  to not have people holding gold and silver
[2:38:42.220 --> 2:38:44.220]  and to try to destroy the market right when it was going
[2:38:44.220 --> 2:38:46.220]  mega-bold
[2:38:46.220 --> 2:38:50.220]  because gold is the only real money in the world
[2:38:50.220 --> 2:38:52.220]  and both gold and silver
[2:38:52.220 --> 2:38:56.220]  normally go up in inflationary environments
[2:38:56.220 --> 2:38:59.220]  usually platinum and wood as well
[2:38:59.220 --> 2:39:03.220]  but we have a very unique situation here
[2:39:03.220 --> 2:39:05.220]  that affects platinum and palladium
[2:39:05.220 --> 2:39:08.220]  and that is that the vehicle production
[2:39:08.220 --> 2:39:10.220]  throughout the entire world
[2:39:10.220 --> 2:39:12.220]  is dropping like a stone
[2:39:12.220 --> 2:39:16.220]  and that's the major usage of those industrial metals
[2:39:16.220 --> 2:39:23.220]  and so to have the platinum come down from 4,000
[2:39:23.220 --> 2:39:28.220]  to 766 dollars this morning
[2:39:28.220 --> 2:39:30.220]  over the last two to three months
[2:39:30.220 --> 2:39:32.220]  is not abnormal
[2:39:32.220 --> 2:39:36.220]  that doesn't apply to silver and gold
[2:39:36.220 --> 2:39:39.220]  really to put it in layman's terms
[2:39:39.220 --> 2:39:43.220]  we have a global price fixing global price controls
[2:39:43.220 --> 2:39:46.220]  and that always when we have price controls of oil or food
[2:39:46.220 --> 2:39:49.220]  here in the 70s you get shortages or in Russia
[2:39:49.220 --> 2:39:52.220]  they got shortages so it's classic price controls
[2:39:52.220 --> 2:39:55.220]  that's right and if you remember
[2:39:55.220 --> 2:39:58.220]  the price controls if you're old enough
[2:39:58.220 --> 2:40:03.220]  in the 1970s and I know Alex is not because he's a younger man
[2:40:03.220 --> 2:40:08.220]  but what happened was that Richard Nixon put them on
[2:40:08.220 --> 2:40:11.220]  and the minute they took them off it was like a geyser
[2:40:11.220 --> 2:40:14.220]  and it's the same in any economy
[2:40:14.220 --> 2:40:17.220]  you put controls on them and you have to take them off
[2:40:17.220 --> 2:40:20.220]  eventually it's in bongo it goes right up in the air
[2:40:20.220 --> 2:40:22.220]  and you'll go to prices
[2:40:22.220 --> 2:40:27.220]  go from perhaps they had a price cap on bread
[2:40:27.220 --> 2:40:32.220]  at $2 a loaf to use it hypothetically
[2:40:32.220 --> 2:40:34.220]  and they held it there for two years
[2:40:34.220 --> 2:40:37.220]  and then they took it off and gold went to
[2:40:37.220 --> 2:40:40.220]  probably a bread went to four dollars a loaf
[2:40:40.220 --> 2:40:42.220]  and that's what happens
[2:40:42.220 --> 2:40:45.220]  all they're doing is buying time
[2:40:45.220 --> 2:40:51.220]  what was gold in 75 from then when it went up to in it in 1980 to 800
[2:40:51.220 --> 2:40:58.220]  75 we were trading
[2:40:58.220 --> 2:41:01.220]  probably around $300 an ounce
[2:41:01.220 --> 2:41:04.220]  and I'm guessing
[2:41:04.220 --> 2:41:07.220]  I've been in this a long time and I got a good memory
[2:41:07.220 --> 2:41:12.220]  but I know that Silver made a run up to 250
[2:41:12.220 --> 2:41:15.220]  and then backed off again to about a dollar
[2:41:15.220 --> 2:41:17.220]  in that general timeframe
[2:41:17.220 --> 2:41:19.220]  but after that it was over
[2:41:19.220 --> 2:41:21.220]  they started both moving up
[2:41:21.220 --> 2:41:27.220]  and as you know in 1980 a gold went to
[2:41:27.220 --> 2:41:30.220]  $850 an ounce in Silver
[2:41:30.220 --> 2:41:34.220]  with the help of the Hunt brothers went to $50 approximately
[2:41:34.220 --> 2:41:37.220]  and the Hunt were going to take delivery
[2:41:37.220 --> 2:41:39.220]  when you talk about bongo
[2:41:39.220 --> 2:41:43.220]  when they stop price fixing gold and silver
[2:41:43.220 --> 2:41:45.220]  when should people dump it
[2:41:45.220 --> 2:41:47.220]  when it bounces
[2:41:47.220 --> 2:41:49.220]  this is a guesstimation dead reckoning
[2:41:49.220 --> 2:41:51.220]  but when is bongo
[2:41:51.220 --> 2:41:53.220]  because it'll go up and then fall
[2:41:53.220 --> 2:41:55.220]  not back where it was but down so
[2:41:55.220 --> 2:41:58.220]  what will be the top when it really goes bongo
[2:41:58.220 --> 2:42:00.220]  versus where it settles out
[2:42:00.220 --> 2:42:03.220]  when you go you have to look at all the money being
[2:42:03.220 --> 2:42:05.220]  shoved into the markets of the world
[2:42:05.220 --> 2:42:07.220]  by all of the central banks
[2:42:07.220 --> 2:42:10.220]  and when you have a situation where money is available
[2:42:10.220 --> 2:42:14.220]  and we don't have this credit restriction we have now
[2:42:14.220 --> 2:42:17.220]  and inflation starts to roar because of it
[2:42:17.220 --> 2:42:20.220]  then you're going to come to some impasse
[2:42:20.220 --> 2:42:23.220]  and that impasse is when
[2:42:23.220 --> 2:42:26.220]  companies, speculators
[2:42:26.220 --> 2:42:30.220]  governments no longer want to borrow money
[2:42:30.220 --> 2:42:34.220]  and when that happens deflation will take over
[2:42:34.220 --> 2:42:37.220]  and that's what Paul Craig Roberts talks about
[2:42:37.220 --> 2:42:39.220]  you know we're two or three years away
[2:42:39.220 --> 2:42:42.220]  because this is an evolutionary process
[2:42:42.220 --> 2:42:45.220]  we don't know when people are going to finally say
[2:42:45.220 --> 2:42:48.220]  I don't want to do that anymore
[2:42:48.220 --> 2:42:52.220]  and then the game is over
[2:42:52.220 --> 2:42:55.220]  so that's the signs that you look for
[2:42:55.220 --> 2:42:57.220]  I usually tell people
[2:42:57.220 --> 2:43:00.220]  the best way to find out is to subscribe to the publication
[2:43:00.220 --> 2:43:03.220]  and when it happens I'll let you know
[2:43:03.220 --> 2:43:06.220]  well Bob
[2:43:06.220 --> 2:43:09.220]  I mean here's the big question we're going to take some calls
[2:43:09.220 --> 2:43:12.220]  at 1-800-259-9231
[2:43:12.220 --> 2:43:15.220]  the banks are hoarding capital
[2:43:15.220 --> 2:43:19.220]  I mean they're putting as you know 500 billion a week out of the window
[2:43:19.220 --> 2:43:21.220]  at the Fed
[2:43:21.220 --> 2:43:23.220]  hundreds of billions a week in the quote bailout
[2:43:23.220 --> 2:43:25.220]  it's going to be over 5 trillion
[2:43:25.220 --> 2:43:27.220]  Ron Paul says it's upwards
[2:43:27.220 --> 2:43:29.220]  it's going to be over 5 trillion
[2:43:29.220 --> 2:43:31.220]  this is Bloomberg reported a month ago
[2:43:31.220 --> 2:43:33.220]  the longer they keep the currency
[2:43:33.220 --> 2:43:35.220]  the liquidity, the credit
[2:43:35.220 --> 2:43:38.220]  cut off the world real economy
[2:43:38.220 --> 2:43:41.220]  the faster the real market is going to die
[2:43:41.220 --> 2:43:44.220]  and so if they continue to hoard the cash
[2:43:44.220 --> 2:43:47.220]  we know then what that means
[2:43:47.220 --> 2:43:49.220]  while they're helicoptering it
[2:43:49.220 --> 2:43:52.220]  only in their own areas
[2:43:52.220 --> 2:43:57.220]  I mean that is going to really debase things even faster
[2:43:57.220 --> 2:43:59.220]  so we'll know very soon
[2:43:59.220 --> 2:44:01.220]  whether they intend to just totally destroy everything
[2:44:01.220 --> 2:44:03.220]  or whether they try to keep the bubble going
[2:44:03.220 --> 2:44:04.220]  you see what I'm saying?
[2:44:04.220 --> 2:44:05.220]  absolutely
[2:44:05.220 --> 2:44:07.220]  and it's one way or the other
[2:44:07.220 --> 2:44:10.220]  and I think Paul Craig Roberts and I are right
[2:44:10.220 --> 2:44:12.220]  and I hope that you're wrong
[2:44:12.220 --> 2:44:16.220]  well I'm not saying Bob that's what's going to happen
[2:44:16.220 --> 2:44:17.220]  I'm saying
[2:44:17.220 --> 2:44:19.220]  no no I'm guessing too
[2:44:19.220 --> 2:44:21.220]  I'm not even guessing that's what's going to happen
[2:44:21.220 --> 2:44:22.220]  I'm asking the question
[2:44:22.220 --> 2:44:23.220]  because it appears
[2:44:23.220 --> 2:44:26.220]  what they're doing is cutting off all the liquidity
[2:44:26.220 --> 2:44:27.220]  to cause a depression
[2:44:27.220 --> 2:44:29.220]  so they're all flush with cash
[2:44:29.220 --> 2:44:30.220]  so they can buy everything up now
[2:44:30.220 --> 2:44:32.220]  sooner rather than later
[2:44:32.220 --> 2:44:35.220]  well that's where the criminal mind comes in
[2:44:35.220 --> 2:44:37.220]  in order to understand these people
[2:44:37.220 --> 2:44:39.220]  you must think like a criminal
[2:44:39.220 --> 2:44:40.220]  no that's what I'm doing
[2:44:40.220 --> 2:44:41.220]  the last thing for them to do
[2:44:41.220 --> 2:44:43.220]  would be to make more money
[2:44:43.220 --> 2:44:45.220]  and so what they'll do is get the markets down
[2:44:45.220 --> 2:44:46.220]  they'll load up
[2:44:46.220 --> 2:44:48.220]  and then take the markets back up again
[2:44:48.220 --> 2:44:50.220]  that's what they'll do
[2:44:50.220 --> 2:44:54.220]  and that'll prolong the system
[2:44:54.220 --> 2:44:55.220]  now to explain that
[2:44:55.220 --> 2:44:56.220]  when the market goes down
[2:44:56.220 --> 2:44:57.220]  they buy in
[2:44:57.220 --> 2:44:58.220]  and then
[2:44:58.220 --> 2:44:59.220]  that's right
[2:44:59.220 --> 2:45:00.220]  and then they run back down
[2:45:00.220 --> 2:45:01.220]  and then all of a sudden
[2:45:01.220 --> 2:45:03.220]  wondrously
[2:45:03.220 --> 2:45:04.220]  on all the media
[2:45:04.220 --> 2:45:06.220]  the banks have
[2:45:06.220 --> 2:45:07.220]  have loosened up
[2:45:07.220 --> 2:45:09.220]  the credit's going to be available
[2:45:09.220 --> 2:45:10.220]  no more 20%
[2:45:10.220 --> 2:45:12.220]  or 10% down
[2:45:12.220 --> 2:45:13.220]  only 5%
[2:45:13.220 --> 2:45:15.220]  and you don't have to have a 700
[2:45:15.220 --> 2:45:16.220]  FOIC
[2:45:16.220 --> 2:45:18.220]  you can have a 650
[2:45:18.220 --> 2:45:20.220]  and everything's going to be hunky dory
[2:45:20.220 --> 2:45:22.220]  and you'll see it everywhere
[2:45:22.220 --> 2:45:24.220]  they'll trot out that
[2:45:24.220 --> 2:45:26.220]  Warren Buffett
[2:45:26.220 --> 2:45:28.220]  the propagandist for the United States government
[2:45:28.220 --> 2:45:30.220]  and he'll tell you the wonders
[2:45:30.220 --> 2:45:31.220]  of what's going to happen
[2:45:31.220 --> 2:45:33.220]  and the market will run to it
[2:45:33.220 --> 2:45:34.220]  at 3,000 points
[2:45:34.220 --> 2:45:37.220]  and they'll be out and left you hanging
[2:45:39.220 --> 2:45:41.220]  absolutely so
[2:45:41.220 --> 2:45:42.220]  they buy it up cheap
[2:45:42.220 --> 2:45:43.220]  run it up
[2:45:43.220 --> 2:45:44.220]  sell it to all the schmucks
[2:45:44.220 --> 2:45:45.220]  they take the capital
[2:45:45.220 --> 2:45:46.220]  put it into the things
[2:45:46.220 --> 2:45:47.220]  they know are going to be safe
[2:45:47.220 --> 2:45:49.220]  and then they finally completely pull the plug
[2:45:50.220 --> 2:45:51.220]  that's right
[2:45:51.220 --> 2:45:53.220]  well they may not
[2:45:53.220 --> 2:45:54.220]  do that
[2:45:54.220 --> 2:45:55.220]  unless it's in their timing
[2:45:55.220 --> 2:45:56.220]  scheme
[2:45:56.220 --> 2:45:58.220]  they may extend things
[2:45:58.220 --> 2:46:00.220]  we don't know that until we get there
[2:46:00.220 --> 2:46:03.220]  that's why this is such a dangerous time
[2:46:03.220 --> 2:46:06.220]  for somebody like me to be a prognosticator
[2:46:06.220 --> 2:46:08.220]  because it's so easy to be wrong
[2:46:08.220 --> 2:46:10.220]  and we've just seen it
[2:46:10.220 --> 2:46:12.220]  well bottom line we know this
[2:46:12.220 --> 2:46:14.220]  they are hyper-inflating the currency
[2:46:14.220 --> 2:46:17.220]  and that is going to in every case
[2:46:17.220 --> 2:46:18.220]  wreck this economy
[2:46:18.220 --> 2:46:19.220]  look at Argentina
[2:46:19.220 --> 2:46:20.220]  where the very same bankers
[2:46:20.220 --> 2:46:22.220]  did the exact same thing
[2:46:22.220 --> 2:46:23.220]  with the only first world nation
[2:46:23.220 --> 2:46:24.220]  in South America
[2:46:24.220 --> 2:46:25.220]  and now here they are
[2:46:25.220 --> 2:46:26.220]  eight years later
[2:46:26.220 --> 2:46:27.220]  after an eight year depression
[2:46:27.220 --> 2:46:28.220]  it's now deepening
[2:46:28.220 --> 2:46:30.220]  Argentina to raise pension funds
[2:46:30.220 --> 2:46:31.220]  to raid pension funds
[2:46:31.220 --> 2:46:34.220]  in desperate search for cash
[2:46:34.220 --> 2:46:37.220]  and this came out today
[2:46:37.220 --> 2:46:39.220]  the credit crisis would be
[2:46:39.220 --> 2:46:41.220]  about to calm
[2:46:41.220 --> 2:46:42.220]  in the biggest victim so far
[2:46:42.220 --> 2:46:43.220]  the credit crisis would be about to claim
[2:46:43.220 --> 2:46:45.220]  it's biggest victim so far
[2:46:45.220 --> 2:46:47.220]  and then it talks about the president there
[2:46:47.220 --> 2:46:50.220]  they're going to raid everybody's pension funds now
[2:46:50.220 --> 2:46:52.220]  that's correct
[2:46:52.220 --> 2:46:56.220]  and maybe other nations might do the same thing
[2:46:56.220 --> 2:46:58.220]  I thought it was very interesting
[2:46:58.220 --> 2:47:00.220]  that this year
[2:47:00.220 --> 2:47:02.220]  that the CalPERS
[2:47:02.220 --> 2:47:04.220]  and California teachers
[2:47:04.220 --> 2:47:06.220]  two biggest pension funds in the country
[2:47:06.220 --> 2:47:08.220]  were up 25%
[2:47:08.220 --> 2:47:10.220]  and for just this last quarter
[2:47:10.220 --> 2:47:13.220]  they were both off 20%
[2:47:13.220 --> 2:47:14.220]  now this continues
[2:47:14.220 --> 2:47:16.220]  which it probably will
[2:47:16.220 --> 2:47:18.220]  over a longer period of time
[2:47:18.220 --> 2:47:22.220]  say for the next five quarters
[2:47:22.220 --> 2:47:24.220]  until the end of 2009
[2:47:24.220 --> 2:47:27.220]  if we see the Dow down at 72.68
[2:47:27.220 --> 2:47:30.220]  or 5,000 or wherever it's going
[2:47:30.220 --> 2:47:33.220]  then they'll probably end up losing
[2:47:33.220 --> 2:47:35.220]  half or more of their money
[2:47:35.220 --> 2:47:39.220]  now how are they going to pay out?
[2:47:39.220 --> 2:47:41.220]  what's going to happen as it becomes
[2:47:41.220 --> 2:47:43.220]  more and more obvious that the bailout
[2:47:43.220 --> 2:47:45.220]  was the foreign international offshore institutions
[2:47:45.220 --> 2:47:47.220]  and nothing's being done
[2:47:47.220 --> 2:47:49.220]  if they're going to inflate the currency
[2:47:49.220 --> 2:47:51.220]  you might as well inflate it and give it to the people
[2:47:51.220 --> 2:47:53.220]  that at least built something in the real economy
[2:47:53.220 --> 2:47:55.220]  but instead it's clear
[2:47:55.220 --> 2:47:57.220]  the people that engineered all this
[2:47:57.220 --> 2:47:59.220]  are hogging all the cash for themselves
[2:47:59.220 --> 2:48:01.220]  and building up a war chest to attack us further
[2:48:01.220 --> 2:48:03.220]  that is a recipe for rioting
[2:48:03.220 --> 2:48:06.220]  no, I'm going to call in Robespierre
[2:48:06.220 --> 2:48:11.220]  okay
[2:48:11.220 --> 2:48:14.220]  much simpler
[2:48:14.220 --> 2:48:16.220]  and explain that to me
[2:48:16.220 --> 2:48:19.220]  let him roll
[2:48:19.220 --> 2:48:22.220]  and by let him roll what do you mean?
[2:48:22.220 --> 2:48:25.220]  well he was the fellow in the French Revolution
[2:48:25.220 --> 2:48:29.220]  that led the people to the gallows
[2:48:29.220 --> 2:48:32.220]  so that they could have the heads cut off
[2:48:32.220 --> 2:48:35.220]  yes
[2:48:35.220 --> 2:48:37.220]  do you think that's going to happen?
[2:48:37.220 --> 2:48:39.220]  without question
[2:48:39.220 --> 2:48:41.220]  and they know it too
[2:48:41.220 --> 2:48:43.220]  the communications being what they are today
[2:48:43.220 --> 2:48:45.220]  this is not 1970
[2:48:45.220 --> 2:48:48.220]  it's not 1380
[2:48:48.220 --> 2:48:50.220]  believe me
[2:48:50.220 --> 2:48:53.220]  people are exposed to information
[2:48:53.220 --> 2:48:56.220]  they've never been exposed to before
[2:48:56.220 --> 2:48:58.220]  I would say
[2:48:58.220 --> 2:49:00.220]  out of the total adult population
[2:49:00.220 --> 2:49:03.220]  50% know something wrong is going on
[2:49:03.220 --> 2:49:05.220]  in 1970
[2:49:05.220 --> 2:49:08.220]  perhaps 15% know
[2:49:08.220 --> 2:49:11.220]  and they're going to be really really mad when
[2:49:11.220 --> 2:49:13.220]  their house is taken away
[2:49:13.220 --> 2:49:14.220]  their cars
[2:49:14.220 --> 2:49:16.220]  their job
[2:49:16.220 --> 2:49:18.220]  what are they going to do?
[2:49:18.220 --> 2:49:20.220]  they've got children
[2:49:20.220 --> 2:49:22.220]  it's going to be rioting
[2:49:22.220 --> 2:49:24.220]  it's going to be nasty
[2:49:26.220 --> 2:49:29.220]  and the people who are in charge they know that
[2:49:29.220 --> 2:49:31.220]  what do you think about the election
[2:49:31.220 --> 2:49:34.220]  they're both dreadful
[2:49:34.220 --> 2:49:39.220]  it goes beyond description
[2:49:39.220 --> 2:49:42.220]  but I do think that
[2:49:42.220 --> 2:49:44.220]  Mr. Obama
[2:49:44.220 --> 2:49:47.220]  could be disqualified before the election
[2:49:47.220 --> 2:49:50.220]  and maybe after the election
[2:49:50.220 --> 2:49:53.220]  because he's not an American citizen
[2:49:53.220 --> 2:49:56.220]  and that would create great consternation
[2:49:56.220 --> 2:49:58.220]  socially throughout America
[2:49:58.220 --> 2:50:03.220]  maybe even turn into some nasty episodes
[2:50:03.220 --> 2:50:06.220]  so that's something that we might have to look forward to
[2:50:06.220 --> 2:50:09.220]  the Euro you're very well aware I'm sure
[2:50:09.220 --> 2:50:11.220]  of the lawsuit that's been filed
[2:50:11.220 --> 2:50:14.220]  in Pennsylvania by Mr. Burke
[2:50:14.220 --> 2:50:15.220]  stay there Bob

[2:51:32.220 --> 2:51:33.220]  a day unlike any other
[2:51:33.220 --> 2:51:35.220]  in the long course of American history
[2:51:35.220 --> 2:51:38.220]  a terrorist act of war against this country
[2:51:38.220 --> 2:51:41.220]  the enemy struck America on September 11th
[2:51:41.220 --> 2:51:43.220]  but who is the enemy?
[2:51:43.220 --> 2:51:44.220]  bin Laden
[2:51:44.220 --> 2:51:45.220]  this is his MO
[2:51:45.220 --> 2:51:46.220]  we have to look to the Middle East
[2:51:46.220 --> 2:51:48.220]  we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[2:51:48.220 --> 2:51:50.220]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[2:51:50.220 --> 2:51:52.220]  to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[2:51:52.220 --> 2:51:55.220]  to intelligence networks inside the United States
[2:51:55.220 --> 2:51:56.220]  some US investigators believe
[2:51:56.220 --> 2:51:58.220]  that there are Israelis again
[2:51:58.220 --> 2:52:02.220]  very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[2:52:02.220 --> 2:52:04.220]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[2:52:04.220 --> 2:52:06.220]  have been detained
[2:52:06.220 --> 2:52:08.220]  bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[2:52:08.220 --> 2:52:10.220]  the hijackers ties to the FBI
[2:52:10.220 --> 2:52:11.220]  the Saudi Arabian connection
[2:52:11.220 --> 2:52:13.220]  the Israeli intelligence network
[2:52:13.220 --> 2:52:14.220]  warnings and war games
[2:52:14.220 --> 2:52:15.220]  the shadow government
[2:52:15.220 --> 2:52:16.220]  and much, much more

[2:52:32.220 --> 2:52:34.220]  do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar
[2:52:34.220 --> 2:52:36.220]  or your own financial future?
[2:52:36.220 --> 2:52:37.220]  is a dismal growth rate
[2:52:37.220 --> 2:52:39.220]  or rampant inflation affecting the bottom line
[2:52:39.220 --> 2:52:41.220]  of your retirement savings accounts?
[2:52:41.220 --> 2:52:43.220]  do you worry about uncontrollable economic events
[2:52:43.220 --> 2:52:45.220]  which could suddenly wipe out
[2:52:45.220 --> 2:52:46.220]  or all of your hard earned savings?
[2:52:46.220 --> 2:52:48.220]  you can turn adversity into opportunity
[2:52:48.220 --> 2:52:50.220]  individual retirement accounts
[2:52:50.220 --> 2:52:52.220]  and most 401k's, 403b's, seps
[2:52:52.220 --> 2:52:54.220]  and other retirement plans
[2:52:54.220 --> 2:52:56.220]  can be rolled over into self-directed accounts
[2:52:56.220 --> 2:52:57.220]  using gold and silver
[2:52:57.220 --> 2:52:59.220]  there are definitely some do's and don'ts
[2:52:59.220 --> 2:53:00.220]  with this rollover process
[2:53:00.220 --> 2:53:02.220]  and that's where Midas Resources comes in

[2:53:11.220 --> 2:53:13.220]  even if other financial assets are failing
[2:53:13.220 --> 2:53:15.220]  it's not a question of
[2:53:15.220 --> 2:53:17.220]  if you'll need precious metals in your portfolio
[2:53:17.220 --> 2:53:19.220]  it's a question of when
[2:53:19.220 --> 2:53:21.220]  so whether you're planning for an economic rainy day
[2:53:21.220 --> 2:53:23.220]  or a Category 5 hurricane

[2:54:06.220 --> 2:54:07.220]  but
[2:54:07.220 --> 2:54:09.220]  what was that case
[2:54:09.220 --> 2:54:11.220]  concerning my passport
[2:54:11.220 --> 2:54:13.220]  and liberty dollars situation

[2:54:23.220 --> 2:54:25.220]  I just can't thank you
[2:54:25.220 --> 2:54:27.220]  not for being out there
[2:54:27.220 --> 2:54:28.220]  it's awesome
[2:54:28.220 --> 2:54:29.220]  well there are a lot of people like us
[2:54:29.220 --> 2:54:30.220]  you're one of them
[2:54:30.220 --> 2:54:31.220]  we're people that want freedom
[2:54:31.220 --> 2:54:33.220]  Alex I give out DVDs
[2:54:33.220 --> 2:54:34.220]  everywhere I go
[2:54:34.220 --> 2:54:35.220]  I give out your information
[2:54:35.220 --> 2:54:36.220]  everywhere I go
[2:54:36.220 --> 2:54:38.220]  I give it to store managers
[2:54:38.220 --> 2:54:39.220]  and gas stations
[2:54:39.220 --> 2:54:40.220]  and everywhere I go
[2:54:40.220 --> 2:54:42.220]  I give stuff out 24-7
[2:54:42.220 --> 2:54:43.220]  so I want to
[2:54:43.220 --> 2:54:44.220]  let you know
[2:54:44.220 --> 2:54:45.220]  everything I can
[2:54:45.220 --> 2:54:47.220]  but what are the chances
[2:54:47.220 --> 2:54:49.220]  of getting Bernanke and Paulson
[2:54:49.220 --> 2:54:50.220]  on your radio show
[2:54:50.220 --> 2:54:52.220]  haha
[2:54:52.220 --> 2:54:54.220]  I mean they might do one or two
[2:54:54.220 --> 2:54:56.220]  media appearances a week
[2:54:56.220 --> 2:54:57.220]  it's all very scripted
[2:54:57.220 --> 2:54:58.220]  very controlled
[2:54:58.220 --> 2:54:59.220]  I mean just the White House
[2:54:59.220 --> 2:55:00.220]  press conferences
[2:55:00.220 --> 2:55:01.220]  they may let 30-40 people in
[2:55:01.220 --> 2:55:03.220]  if you ever ask a serious question
[2:55:03.220 --> 2:55:05.220]  you're never in there again
[2:55:05.220 --> 2:55:06.220]  unless you're you know
[2:55:06.220 --> 2:55:08.220]  a few little token people
[2:55:08.220 --> 2:55:09.220]  they have
[2:55:09.220 --> 2:55:11.220]  you know old time reporters
[2:55:11.220 --> 2:55:12.220]  and still that's within the
[2:55:12.220 --> 2:55:14.220]  control system
[2:55:14.220 --> 2:55:15.220]  but Ron Paul
[2:55:15.220 --> 2:55:16.220]  on the banking committee
[2:55:16.220 --> 2:55:17.220]  he's able
[2:55:17.220 --> 2:55:18.220]  once a month or so
[2:55:18.220 --> 2:55:20.220]  to ask really serious questions
[2:55:20.220 --> 2:55:22.220]  and I know Bernanke
[2:55:22.220 --> 2:55:24.220]  really does dread
[2:55:24.220 --> 2:55:26.220]  having to put up with that
[2:55:26.220 --> 2:55:28.220]  but you know I've called for them
[2:55:28.220 --> 2:55:29.220]  to be arrested
[2:55:29.220 --> 2:55:30.220]  so has Ron Paul
[2:55:30.220 --> 2:55:31.220]  so I don't know
[2:55:31.220 --> 2:55:33.220]  if they'll be coming on my show
[2:55:33.220 --> 2:55:34.220]  anytime soon
[2:55:34.220 --> 2:55:35.220]  speaking of arrest
[2:55:35.220 --> 2:55:36.220]  they've committed a lot of crimes
[2:55:36.220 --> 2:55:37.220]  Bob Chapman
[2:55:37.220 --> 2:55:38.220]  Ron Paul's listed some
[2:55:38.220 --> 2:55:39.220]  what are some of the crimes
[2:55:39.220 --> 2:55:44.220]  that they can be arrested for
[2:55:44.220 --> 2:55:45.220]  who Bernanke
[2:55:45.220 --> 2:55:46.220]  yeah and Paulson
[2:55:46.220 --> 2:55:47.220]  and the rest of them
[2:55:47.220 --> 2:55:49.220]  well I you know
[2:55:49.220 --> 2:55:51.220]  the Federal Reserve
[2:55:51.220 --> 2:55:52.220]  is private
[2:55:52.220 --> 2:55:54.220]  it's an act of Congress
[2:55:54.220 --> 2:55:57.220]  I don't know what they're doing
[2:55:57.220 --> 2:55:58.220]  within the Federal Reserve
[2:55:58.220 --> 2:55:59.220]  that's illegal
[2:55:59.220 --> 2:56:00.220]  because we can't find out
[2:56:00.220 --> 2:56:01.220]  it's just like
[2:56:01.220 --> 2:56:03.220]  and the Treasury has a subsidiary
[2:56:03.220 --> 2:56:06.220]  called the Exchange Stabilization Fund
[2:56:06.220 --> 2:56:08.220]  we know that they're using that fund
[2:56:08.220 --> 2:56:11.220]  the fund will go through
[2:56:11.220 --> 2:56:13.220]  to bomb the market with
[2:56:13.220 --> 2:56:14.220]  but we can't prove it
[2:56:14.220 --> 2:56:17.220]  because we can't access it
[2:56:17.220 --> 2:56:21.220]  and how much money does the Exchange Stabilization Fund have
[2:56:21.220 --> 2:56:23.220]  I think they report once a year
[2:56:23.220 --> 2:56:24.220]  well Bob on its
[2:56:24.220 --> 2:56:26.220]  $600 billion we don't know
[2:56:26.220 --> 2:56:27.220]  what they do with it
[2:56:27.220 --> 2:56:30.220]  but Bob on its face you've got
[2:56:30.220 --> 2:56:32.220]  almost everybody running the scam
[2:56:32.220 --> 2:56:33.220]  handing out the trillions
[2:56:33.220 --> 2:56:35.220]  in the Banker Takeover Bill
[2:56:35.220 --> 2:56:36.220]  is Goldman Sachs
[2:56:36.220 --> 2:56:38.220]  they have meetings with the bankers
[2:56:38.220 --> 2:56:40.220]  and had hundreds of billions secretly
[2:56:40.220 --> 2:56:41.220]  until the public you can't see it
[2:56:41.220 --> 2:56:44.220]  that violates all sorts of disclosure laws
[2:56:44.220 --> 2:56:45.220]  through the Treasury right there
[2:56:45.220 --> 2:56:46.220]  I mean insider trading
[2:56:46.220 --> 2:56:47.220]  the list goes on and on
[2:56:47.220 --> 2:56:48.220]  that's true
[2:56:48.220 --> 2:56:50.220]  and did you see the piece that came up
[2:56:50.220 --> 2:56:52.220]  in the house yesterday
[2:56:52.220 --> 2:56:54.220]  that was redacted to death
[2:56:54.220 --> 2:56:56.220]  yeah the Huffington Post reported on that
[2:56:56.220 --> 2:56:59.220]  and tell folks about that
[2:56:59.220 --> 2:57:02.220]  well they had a proposal
[2:57:02.220 --> 2:57:05.220]  to have Mellon Bank
[2:57:05.220 --> 2:57:08.220]  manage some funds or whatever they were doing
[2:57:08.220 --> 2:57:11.220]  and what they were getting paid for
[2:57:11.220 --> 2:57:14.220]  doing that was redacted
[2:57:14.220 --> 2:57:16.220]  and the committee chairman said
[2:57:16.220 --> 2:57:19.220]  you know this is like CIA
[2:57:19.220 --> 2:57:21.220]  I mean why don't they want to tell us
[2:57:21.220 --> 2:57:22.220]  and then they bought on
[2:57:22.220 --> 2:57:26.220]  Bill Seidman who ran the RTC
[2:57:26.220 --> 2:57:29.220]  back in the 1980s
[2:57:29.220 --> 2:57:31.220]  which was the agency
[2:57:31.220 --> 2:57:34.220]  that took care of
[2:57:34.220 --> 2:57:36.220]  the failure of savings and loans
[2:57:36.220 --> 2:57:38.220]  and wrapped it all up and fixed it up
[2:57:38.220 --> 2:57:40.220]  but they announced, Bill says
[2:57:40.220 --> 2:57:42.220]  look everything we did
[2:57:42.220 --> 2:57:43.220]  we announced it immediately
[2:57:43.220 --> 2:57:45.220]  everything was open
[2:57:45.220 --> 2:57:47.220]  you know everything was truthful
[2:57:47.220 --> 2:57:49.220]  I mean he stopped himself you know
[2:57:49.220 --> 2:57:51.220]  and if you can't do this
[2:57:51.220 --> 2:57:53.220]  you're losing even more confidence
[2:57:53.220 --> 2:57:54.220]  than you have already
[2:57:54.220 --> 2:57:56.220]  and then the committee
[2:57:56.220 --> 2:57:59.220]  Waxman said the same thing
[2:57:59.220 --> 2:58:00.220]  stay there thanks for the call
[2:58:00.220 --> 2:58:01.220]  Shane, Jay, Tony
[2:58:01.220 --> 2:58:02.220]  from Sedum
[2:58:02.220 --> 2:58:03.220]  unless everybody
[2:58:03.220 --> 2:58:05.220]  is coming up but this is so big
[2:58:05.220 --> 2:58:06.220]  so criminal
[2:58:06.220 --> 2:58:08.220]  we don't even have words to describe it
[2:58:08.220 --> 2:58:09.220]  they're just handing out secret money
[2:58:09.220 --> 2:58:10.220]  to whoever they want
[2:58:10.220 --> 2:58:11.220]  total criminals
[2:58:14.220 --> 2:58:16.220]  thank you for listening to GCN

[2:58:22.220 --> 2:58:24.220]  it is a big idea
[2:58:24.220 --> 2:58:26.220]  a new world order
[2:58:26.220 --> 2:58:28.220]  in the near future
[2:58:28.220 --> 2:58:31.220]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[2:58:31.220 --> 2:58:34.220]  it's known as the Bilderberg
[2:58:34.220 --> 2:58:37.220]  does their objective be world domination?
[2:58:37.220 --> 2:58:38.220]  for thousands of years
[2:58:38.220 --> 2:58:40.220]  their dark order grew
[2:58:40.220 --> 2:58:42.220]  now as they hail the birth
[2:58:42.220 --> 2:58:43.220]  of the new world order
[2:58:43.220 --> 2:58:44.220]  their great dream
[2:58:44.220 --> 2:58:46.220]  of exterminating 80%
[2:58:46.220 --> 2:58:48.220]  of humanity is at hand
[2:58:50.220 --> 2:58:52.220]  for the first time in history
[2:58:52.220 --> 2:58:54.220]  the elites plan for world government
[2:58:54.220 --> 2:58:56.220]  is blown wide open
[2:58:56.220 --> 2:58:57.220]  you will learn the secret
[2:58:57.220 --> 2:58:58.220]  that drives the entire
[2:58:58.220 --> 2:59:00.220]  new world order agenda
[2:59:00.220 --> 2:59:02.220]  Bilderberg is making great progress
[2:59:02.220 --> 2:59:03.220]  for the world government
[2:59:03.220 --> 2:59:04.220]  most people have no idea
[2:59:04.220 --> 2:59:05.220]  they're not after money
[2:59:05.220 --> 2:59:06.220]  they have all the money they need
[2:59:06.220 --> 2:59:07.220]  they're after power
[2:59:07.220 --> 2:59:08.220]  yes they're after easy

[2:59:58.220 --> 3:00:00.220]  for the next 30 minutes

[3:00:02.220 --> 3:00:04.220]  and a host of issues
[3:00:04.220 --> 3:00:05.220]  we just went live
[3:00:05.220 --> 3:00:07.220]  at prisonplanet.tv
[3:00:07.220 --> 3:00:08.220]  as we do every day
[3:00:08.220 --> 3:00:09.220]  during the fourth hour
[3:00:09.220 --> 3:00:10.220]  some days the whole show
[3:00:10.220 --> 3:00:12.220]  is streamed over the web
[3:00:12.220 --> 3:00:14.220]  for prisonplanet.tv members
[3:00:14.220 --> 3:00:15.220]  Bob finish up
[3:00:15.220 --> 3:00:17.220]  and we're going to go back to calls
[3:00:17.220 --> 3:00:20.220]  Jay and others that are holding
[3:00:20.220 --> 3:00:23.220]  with Congress
[3:00:25.220 --> 3:00:27.220]  is demanding documents
[3:00:27.220 --> 3:00:29.220]  about the trillions being handed out
[3:00:29.220 --> 3:00:30.220]  in the bank or takeover bill
[3:00:30.220 --> 3:00:31.220]  not 700 billion
[3:00:31.220 --> 3:00:32.220]  they admitted
[3:00:32.220 --> 3:00:34.220]  that oh well we didn't want to give you
[3:00:34.220 --> 3:00:35.220]  a number too big
[3:00:35.220 --> 3:00:36.220]  but not one too low
[3:00:36.220 --> 3:00:37.220]  just give you an idea
[3:00:37.220 --> 3:00:38.220]  it actually said just unlimited
[3:00:38.220 --> 3:00:39.220]  do whatever you want
[3:00:39.220 --> 3:00:40.220]  no transparency
[3:00:40.220 --> 3:00:42.220]  no one can look at you
[3:00:42.220 --> 3:00:44.220]  no agency can ever investigate what you've done
[3:00:44.220 --> 3:00:46.220]  I mean this is written for fraud
[3:00:46.220 --> 3:00:47.220]  and criminality
[3:00:47.220 --> 3:00:49.220]  by those that have caused all the crises
[3:00:49.220 --> 3:00:52.220]  and yeah I meant to get to yesterday
[3:00:52.220 --> 3:00:53.220]  I just mentioned it
[3:00:53.220 --> 3:00:54.220]  it was on Huffington Post
[3:00:54.220 --> 3:00:55.220]  also up on infowars.com
[3:00:55.220 --> 3:00:56.220]  and prisonplanet.com
[3:00:56.220 --> 3:00:57.220]  we linked to it
[3:00:57.220 --> 3:01:00.220]  where Congress was given these blacked out documents
[3:01:00.220 --> 3:01:02.220]  about how much these banks are being paid
[3:01:02.220 --> 3:01:04.220]  to hand the money out to other banks
[3:01:04.220 --> 3:01:07.220]  with all these cronies
[3:01:07.220 --> 3:01:09.220]  inside Goldman Sachs running the bank
[3:01:09.220 --> 3:01:10.220]  or bail out
[3:01:10.220 --> 3:01:12.220]  giving the money to themselves
[3:01:12.220 --> 3:01:13.220]  and it's like the CIA
[3:01:13.220 --> 3:01:14.220]  where it's all blacked out
[3:01:14.220 --> 3:01:16.220]  I mean Bob Chapman
[3:01:16.220 --> 3:01:18.220]  the magnitude
[3:01:18.220 --> 3:01:20.220]  the hutzpah
[3:01:20.220 --> 3:01:21.220]  the arrogance
[3:01:21.220 --> 3:01:23.220]  the over the topness
[3:01:23.220 --> 3:01:25.220]  of the corruption we're seeing
[3:01:25.220 --> 3:01:27.220]  I mean it even staggers my mind
[3:01:27.220 --> 3:01:29.220]  comment some more on that
[3:01:29.220 --> 3:01:31.220]  it was truly arrogance
[3:01:31.220 --> 3:01:33.220]  they don't care what we think
[3:01:33.220 --> 3:01:35.220]  you know with the sheeple
[3:01:35.220 --> 3:01:37.220]  and where to be treated that way
[3:01:37.220 --> 3:01:40.220]  and you know in history
[3:01:40.220 --> 3:01:41.220]  if you look back
[3:01:41.220 --> 3:01:43.220]  all groups or all people
[3:01:43.220 --> 3:01:45.220]  who have acted that way
[3:01:45.220 --> 3:01:47.220]  end up in
[3:01:47.220 --> 3:01:50.220]  a way that they don't want to end up
[3:01:50.220 --> 3:01:53.220]  and that's what's going to happen in America
[3:01:53.220 --> 3:01:55.220]  if people think
[3:01:55.220 --> 3:01:57.220]  that they can't get to these people
[3:01:57.220 --> 3:01:58.220]  they can't
[3:01:58.220 --> 3:02:01.220]  because we're going to have a chaotic situation
[3:02:01.220 --> 3:02:03.220]  down the line here
[3:02:03.220 --> 3:02:04.220]  and people are going to say
[3:02:04.220 --> 3:02:05.220]  who did that to me
[3:02:05.220 --> 3:02:07.220]  and so there will be a price to pay
[3:02:07.220 --> 3:02:09.220]  but in the meantime
[3:02:09.220 --> 3:02:12.220]  yes they're getting paid unholy sums
[3:02:12.220 --> 3:02:13.220]  by their friends
[3:02:13.220 --> 3:02:15.220]  to handle this
[3:02:15.220 --> 3:02:17.220]  the supposed
[3:02:17.220 --> 3:02:20.220]  saving of Americans financial society
[3:02:20.220 --> 3:02:22.220]  we're talking about
[3:02:22.220 --> 3:02:24.220]  when all is said and done
[3:02:24.220 --> 3:02:27.220]  over ten trillion dollars
[3:02:27.220 --> 3:02:29.220]  right now they're talking about
[3:02:29.220 --> 3:02:32.220]  700 billion or 1.2 trillion
[3:02:32.220 --> 3:02:35.220]  then 1.8
[3:02:35.220 --> 3:02:38.220]  they ain't even scratching the surface yet
[3:02:38.220 --> 3:02:40.220]  these people are going to steal
[3:02:40.220 --> 3:02:42.220]  so much it's unbelievable
[3:02:42.220 --> 3:02:44.220]  and then the system will collapse
[3:02:44.220 --> 3:02:46.220]  and they think they're going to get away with it
[3:02:46.220 --> 3:02:47.220]  and they're not
[3:02:47.220 --> 3:02:49.220]  because people like you Alex
[3:02:49.220 --> 3:02:51.220]  have guests on
[3:02:51.220 --> 3:02:53.220]  who are going to tell the public
[3:02:53.220 --> 3:02:54.220]  what they've done
[3:02:54.220 --> 3:02:56.220]  and how they've stolen all this money
[3:02:56.220 --> 3:02:58.220]  how corrupt they are
[3:02:58.220 --> 3:03:00.220]  and the public is going to react
[3:03:00.220 --> 3:03:01.220]  well Bob
[3:03:01.220 --> 3:03:02.220]  either that or before that
[3:03:02.220 --> 3:03:03.220]  they're going to shoot you and I
[3:03:03.220 --> 3:03:04.220]  one or the other
[3:03:04.220 --> 3:03:05.220]  well Bob
[3:03:05.220 --> 3:03:07.220]  I mean I know you're aware of this
[3:03:07.220 --> 3:03:08.220]  but it's on the local news
[3:03:08.220 --> 3:03:10.220]  everybody I know is calling me about it
[3:03:10.220 --> 3:03:11.220]  all over the country
[3:03:11.220 --> 3:03:12.220]  thousands of bankers
[3:03:12.220 --> 3:03:14.220]  the Federal Reserve
[3:03:14.220 --> 3:03:16.220]  ranch banks are even calling local
[3:03:16.220 --> 3:03:17.220]  banker heads
[3:03:17.220 --> 3:03:18.220]  who aren't even part of the inner group
[3:03:18.220 --> 3:03:19.220]  and they're going to schools
[3:03:19.220 --> 3:03:21.220]  elementary schools, churches
[3:03:21.220 --> 3:03:23.220]  telling them they're our friends
[3:03:23.220 --> 3:03:24.220]  telling them false stories
[3:03:24.220 --> 3:03:25.220]  about how all this happened
[3:03:25.220 --> 3:03:27.220]  and how some things are coming
[3:03:27.220 --> 3:03:28.220]  but just do what we say
[3:03:28.220 --> 3:03:30.220]  so they know they're in danger
[3:03:30.220 --> 3:03:31.220]  or they wouldn't be out
[3:03:31.220 --> 3:03:33.220]  beating the pavement
[3:03:33.220 --> 3:03:34.220]  instead of playing golf
[3:03:34.220 --> 3:03:36.220]  or visiting their mistresses
[3:03:36.220 --> 3:03:37.220]  they're all over pushing this
[3:03:37.220 --> 3:03:39.220]  and then announcing army brigades
[3:03:39.220 --> 3:03:41.220]  and trying to intimidate the public
[3:03:41.220 --> 3:03:44.220]  but I guess they just can't help it
[3:03:44.220 --> 3:03:45.220]  the words of PNAC
[3:03:45.220 --> 3:03:46.220]  they've got the power
[3:03:46.220 --> 3:03:48.220]  and they say we just need to go ahead
[3:03:48.220 --> 3:03:49.220]  and use it
[3:03:49.220 --> 3:03:51.220]  I mean I guess they just can't help themselves
[3:03:51.220 --> 3:03:53.220]  it's amazing
[3:03:53.220 --> 3:03:54.220]  right and they've had that
[3:03:54.220 --> 3:03:56.220]  their way for a long time
[3:03:56.220 --> 3:03:58.220]  we haven't had a
[3:03:58.220 --> 3:04:00.220]  well we had the depression
[3:04:00.220 --> 3:04:03.220]  but by historical the standards
[3:04:03.220 --> 3:04:05.220]  it was bad but not that bad
[3:04:05.220 --> 3:04:06.220]  I mean we had the 1870s
[3:04:06.220 --> 3:04:08.220]  which is really bad
[3:04:08.220 --> 3:04:09.220]  it's no matter
[3:04:09.220 --> 3:04:11.220]  it's no wonder everybody
[3:04:11.220 --> 3:04:12.220]  headed west
[3:04:12.220 --> 3:04:14.220]  they grabbed the face of the Indians
[3:04:14.220 --> 3:04:16.220]  and the people in the cities
[3:04:16.220 --> 3:04:20.220]  but we had some pretty nasty times historically
[3:04:20.220 --> 3:04:22.220]  and we could be returning to that
[3:04:22.220 --> 3:04:23.220]  could be
[3:04:23.220 --> 3:04:24.220]  we're going to skip this break
[3:04:24.220 --> 3:04:25.220]  for prisonplanet.tv viewers
[3:04:25.220 --> 3:04:27.220]  stay with us
[3:04:30.220 --> 3:04:32.220]  alright Bob
[3:04:32.220 --> 3:04:33.220]  I want to go to calls
[3:04:33.220 --> 3:04:34.220]  right when we come back
[3:04:34.220 --> 3:04:36.220]  for Jay, Tony and everybody else
[3:04:36.220 --> 3:04:37.220]  that's holding
[3:04:37.220 --> 3:04:38.220]  I want to go to them fast
[3:04:38.220 --> 3:04:39.220]  there's just so many questions
[3:04:39.220 --> 3:04:41.220]  I've got for you
[3:04:41.220 --> 3:04:42.220]  bad to worse
[3:04:42.220 --> 3:04:44.220]  I mean you say it could be heading that way
[3:04:44.220 --> 3:04:46.220]  I mean Chrysler's laying off
[3:04:46.220 --> 3:04:48.220]  25% of their employees
[3:04:48.220 --> 3:04:49.220]  I mean I live
[3:04:49.220 --> 3:04:51.220]  as opposed to the most wealthy
[3:04:51.220 --> 3:04:53.220]  best off most balanced city in the country
[3:04:53.220 --> 3:04:55.220]  Austin's rated number one everywhere now
[3:04:55.220 --> 3:04:56.220]  per capita
[3:04:56.220 --> 3:04:57.220]  and I mean let me tell you
[3:04:57.220 --> 3:04:59.220]  the economy is
[3:04:59.220 --> 3:05:00.220]  you go to restaurants
[3:05:00.220 --> 3:05:01.220]  that you couldn't get in
[3:05:01.220 --> 3:05:02.220]  I'll take my wife out once a week
[3:05:02.220 --> 3:05:03.220]  there's restaurants
[3:05:03.220 --> 3:05:04.220]  we have to call it reservations
[3:05:04.220 --> 3:05:05.220]  not anymore
[3:05:05.220 --> 3:05:06.220]  you go to the mall
[3:05:06.220 --> 3:05:07.220]  it's empty
[3:05:07.220 --> 3:05:08.220]  you go to car dealerships
[3:05:08.220 --> 3:05:09.220]  they're shutting down
[3:05:09.220 --> 3:05:11.220]  I mean what's it going to be like
[3:05:11.220 --> 3:05:13.220]  for in other like Michigan
[3:05:13.220 --> 3:05:15.220]  and California and Arizona
[3:05:15.220 --> 3:05:17.220]  very dreadful in Michigan
[3:05:17.220 --> 3:05:20.220]  and it's going to be California
[3:05:20.220 --> 3:05:21.220]  anybody who lived there
[3:05:21.220 --> 3:05:23.220]  I tell them start carrying
[3:05:23.220 --> 3:05:25.220]  illegally
[3:05:25.220 --> 3:05:26.220]  because you're going to need it
[3:05:26.220 --> 3:05:28.220]  I mean it's 200,000 gang members
[3:05:28.220 --> 3:05:30.220]  with automatic weapons
[3:05:30.220 --> 3:05:31.220]  I mean the police are afraid
[3:05:31.220 --> 3:05:34.220]  to do anything to them
[3:05:34.220 --> 3:05:36.220]  and that's just in the long beach
[3:05:36.220 --> 3:05:38.220]  in the valley area
[3:05:40.220 --> 3:05:41.220]  yeah it's unbelievable
[3:05:41.220 --> 3:05:42.220]  I just
[3:05:42.220 --> 3:05:44.220]  no it's going to get nasty
[3:05:44.220 --> 3:05:46.220]  and we're on the right track
[3:05:46.220 --> 3:05:48.220]  and the more people we reach the better
[3:05:48.220 --> 3:05:50.220]  at least they'll be able to handle it better
[3:05:50.220 --> 3:05:52.220]  now say hey Alex said that
[3:05:52.220 --> 3:05:54.220]  he was right now I know what to do
[3:05:57.220 --> 3:05:59.220]  we're making a big difference believe me
[3:05:59.220 --> 3:06:00.220]  I know we are
[3:06:00.220 --> 3:06:01.220]  but I mean a lot of macho guys
[3:06:01.220 --> 3:06:02.220]  get into the fact
[3:06:02.220 --> 3:06:03.220]  that it's going to get real bloody
[3:06:03.220 --> 3:06:05.220]  I'm upset by all this
[3:06:05.220 --> 3:06:07.220]  and I just so it's so needless
[3:06:07.220 --> 3:06:10.220]  but you've got these swollen know-it-all pimps
[3:06:10.220 --> 3:06:11.220]  running everything
[3:06:11.220 --> 3:06:13.220]  and they just get away with so much crap
[3:06:13.220 --> 3:06:14.220]  and they just
[3:06:14.220 --> 3:06:15.220]  they're going to destroy everything
[3:06:15.220 --> 3:06:18.220]  it's very very very frustrating
[3:06:18.220 --> 3:06:20.220]  you know I wrote a piece this morning
[3:06:20.220 --> 3:06:23.220]  you know these masters of the universe
[3:06:23.220 --> 3:06:26.220]  they're all Ivy League
[3:06:26.220 --> 3:06:28.220]  they're all bright
[3:06:28.220 --> 3:06:30.220]  they're all connected
[3:06:30.220 --> 3:06:32.220]  they're willing to
[3:06:32.220 --> 3:06:37.220]  pledge obedience
[3:06:37.220 --> 3:06:39.220]  to the illuminous fate and its power
[3:06:39.220 --> 3:06:42.220]  in order to have a good life
[3:06:46.220 --> 3:06:47.220]  I know that three occur ball
[3:06:47.220 --> 3:06:49.220]  with imploding the gold
[3:06:49.220 --> 3:06:50.220]  over 150 bucks
[3:06:50.220 --> 3:06:51.220]  that's okay
[3:06:51.220 --> 3:06:55.220]  I understand where do you see it going
[3:06:55.220 --> 3:06:58.220]  well it's trying to find a bottom right now
[3:06:58.220 --> 3:07:00.220]  both gold and silver
[3:07:00.220 --> 3:07:02.220]  and whether it's here or not I don't know
[3:07:02.220 --> 3:07:04.220]  but when it comes it comes
[3:07:04.220 --> 3:07:06.220]  and they'll go right back up again
[3:07:06.220 --> 3:07:08.220]  and it's going to change anything
[3:07:08.220 --> 3:07:10.220]  I told everybody you're in for the long term
[3:07:10.220 --> 3:07:11.220]  don't you sell anything
[3:07:11.220 --> 3:07:13.220]  so you just lost
[3:07:13.220 --> 3:07:15.220]  you know hundreds and you know thousands
[3:07:15.220 --> 3:07:17.220]  of dollars in profits so what
[3:07:17.220 --> 3:07:19.220]  you're in for the long term
[3:07:19.220 --> 3:07:21.220]  I can't get you jumping in out of the market
[3:07:21.220 --> 3:07:24.220]  like a jack rabbit
[3:07:24.220 --> 3:07:26.220]  and most of these people are elderly too
[3:07:26.220 --> 3:07:28.220]  elderly is over 50
[3:07:28.220 --> 3:07:30.220]  and so you know they're not trained for that
[3:07:30.220 --> 3:07:31.220]  yeah here we go
[3:07:31.220 --> 3:07:33.220]  Texas Command Center
[3:07:33.220 --> 3:07:35.220]  deep behind enemy lines
[3:07:35.220 --> 3:07:37.220]  the information war continues
[3:07:37.220 --> 3:07:41.220]  it's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[3:07:43.220 --> 3:07:45.220]  Worldwide there's only one group doing good
[3:07:45.220 --> 3:07:48.220]  and that's the small intergroup of private banks
[3:07:48.220 --> 3:07:50.220]  they're gobbling up the other banks
[3:07:50.220 --> 3:07:51.220]  corporations
[3:07:51.220 --> 3:07:54.220]  every major market is bleeding to death
[3:07:54.220 --> 3:07:57.220]  every major industry is imploding
[3:07:57.220 --> 3:07:59.220]  and the bankers are setting up their world
[3:07:59.220 --> 3:08:01.220]  government Bob Chapman's our guest
[3:08:01.220 --> 3:08:02.220]  Jay in Texas and Tony
[3:08:02.220 --> 3:08:04.220]  Prince Seta Melissa
[3:08:04.220 --> 3:08:06.220]  Jay go ahead quickly
[3:08:06.220 --> 3:08:08.220]  hey what's going on Alex what's going on Bob
[3:08:08.220 --> 3:08:11.220]  yeah Bob stole a lot of my thunder
[3:08:11.220 --> 3:08:13.220]  actually earlier with the with the Dow
[3:08:13.220 --> 3:08:15.220]  I've been in this business for about seven years now
[3:08:15.220 --> 3:08:19.220]  and he says you know the 2002-2003 lows
[3:08:19.220 --> 3:08:22.220]  I think we go much lower than that personally
[3:08:22.220 --> 3:08:24.220]  and you can actually see the evidence of
[3:08:24.220 --> 3:08:26.220]  if you even believe in the PPT
[3:08:26.220 --> 3:08:28.220]  I know some of the punch protection team
[3:08:28.220 --> 3:08:30.220]  I know some do some don't
[3:08:30.220 --> 3:08:32.220]  but you know the market was down 500
[3:08:32.220 --> 3:08:34.220]  you know start of the day
[3:08:34.220 --> 3:08:36.220]  we've just rallied to a hundred and
[3:08:36.220 --> 3:08:38.220]  you know 3,540 so on the Dow
[3:08:38.220 --> 3:08:41.220]  I think now live we're about 200 down
[3:08:41.220 --> 3:08:43.220]  and uh
[3:08:43.220 --> 3:08:46.220]  if you know that the crisis has hit Wall Street
[3:08:46.220 --> 3:08:48.220]  but it hasn't hit Main Street yet
[3:08:48.220 --> 3:08:50.220]  and we'll know how severe it gets
[3:08:50.220 --> 3:08:52.220]  when the October mutual fund redemption come up
[3:08:52.220 --> 3:08:54.220]  did I hear you say you don't know
[3:08:54.220 --> 3:08:58.220]  if the president's group on open markets
[3:08:58.220 --> 3:09:00.220]  is real
[3:09:00.220 --> 3:09:02.220]  no that's not me I said I don't know
[3:09:02.220 --> 3:09:03.220]  if other people don't believe it
[3:09:03.220 --> 3:09:04.220]  I personally believe it
[3:09:04.220 --> 3:09:06.220]  I see in the market every single day
[3:09:06.220 --> 3:09:07.220]  well no I mean they admit it
[3:09:07.220 --> 3:09:09.220]  Bob you want to comment on that
[3:09:09.220 --> 3:09:11.220]  well you're right they do
[3:09:11.220 --> 3:09:15.220]  and you know the working group of financial markets
[3:09:15.220 --> 3:09:17.220]  but the gentleman said he believes that
[3:09:17.220 --> 3:09:19.220]  but a number of other people don't
[3:09:19.220 --> 3:09:22.220]  well that's fine and they'll pay for it in spades
[3:09:22.220 --> 3:09:24.220]  and I agree with the gentleman
[3:09:24.220 --> 3:09:28.220]  not only are we going to test 7268
[3:09:28.220 --> 3:09:30.220]  we'll have a thousand two thousand
[3:09:30.220 --> 3:09:32.220]  point rally and they'll make all their money
[3:09:32.220 --> 3:09:34.220]  they'll let it go back down again
[3:09:34.220 --> 3:09:36.220]  and it'll probably break the 6,000
[3:09:36.220 --> 3:09:39.220]  then to five and then to 3,800
[3:09:39.220 --> 3:09:41.220]  and it might if we're lucky
[3:09:41.220 --> 3:09:43.220]  it'll stay there
[3:09:43.220 --> 3:09:45.220]  who knows where this thing is going
[3:09:45.220 --> 3:09:46.220]  do you agree color
[3:09:46.220 --> 3:09:48.220]  oh yeah absolutely Bob I mean
[3:09:48.220 --> 3:09:50.220]  my personal is 4,500 on the Dow
[3:09:50.220 --> 3:09:53.220]  and I see that within maybe
[3:09:53.220 --> 3:09:55.220]  I would say a year to 18 months
[3:09:55.220 --> 3:09:57.220]  good trade
[3:09:57.220 --> 3:09:59.220]  charting wise
[3:09:59.220 --> 3:10:01.220]  I mean if you look at the S&P right now
[3:10:01.220 --> 3:10:02.220]  which is mainly what I follow
[3:10:02.220 --> 3:10:05.220]  you see a huge triangle on there right now
[3:10:05.220 --> 3:10:07.220]  roughly if you want to test the 839 lows
[3:10:07.220 --> 3:10:09.220]  about October 10th
[3:10:09.220 --> 3:10:11.220]  we break that
[3:10:11.220 --> 3:10:12.220]  you say good night
[3:10:12.220 --> 3:10:14.220]  you see 600 I think in a heartbeat
[3:10:14.220 --> 3:10:15.220]  on the S&P
[3:10:15.220 --> 3:10:17.220]  so they had broke down again the S&P
[3:10:17.220 --> 3:10:19.220]  they did but it snapped back
[3:10:19.220 --> 3:10:21.220]  and you had those snapback rallies which
[3:10:21.220 --> 3:10:22.220]  right there
[3:10:22.220 --> 3:10:23.220]  well the snapback is
[3:10:23.220 --> 3:10:25.220]  the plunge protection team in there
[3:10:25.220 --> 3:10:27.220]  because since I got on this phone
[3:10:27.220 --> 3:10:29.220]  with Alex they've tried 12 times
[3:10:29.220 --> 3:10:30.220]  to rally it
[3:10:30.220 --> 3:10:32.220]  we're on number 13 right now
[3:10:32.220 --> 3:10:34.220]  yeah it's 163 and I completely
[3:10:34.220 --> 3:10:36.220]  agree with you
[3:10:36.220 --> 3:10:38.220]  but once that breaks and like I said
[3:10:38.220 --> 3:10:40.220]  you see the mutual fund redemption
[3:10:40.220 --> 3:10:42.220]  in the rumors of the quant funds
[3:10:42.220 --> 3:10:45.220]  quant funds broke breaking up in the market
[3:10:45.220 --> 3:10:47.220]  which caused all these selling anyway
[3:10:47.220 --> 3:10:49.220]  once people see October 31st
[3:10:49.220 --> 3:10:51.220]  the next month is when mutual funds
[3:10:51.220 --> 3:10:53.220]  have to report what they're going to do
[3:10:53.220 --> 3:10:55.220]  that's the end of the year cycle
[3:10:55.220 --> 3:10:57.220]  yeah a lot of companies are going to
[3:10:57.220 --> 3:10:59.220]  make their dividends are they
[3:10:59.220 --> 3:11:01.220]  well you know a lot of companies
[3:11:01.220 --> 3:11:03.220]  the lower the stock price
[3:11:03.220 --> 3:11:05.220]  the higher the dividend yield goes
[3:11:05.220 --> 3:11:07.220]  and you see some companies
[3:11:07.220 --> 3:11:09.220]  saying no we're not going to do this
[3:11:09.220 --> 3:11:11.220]  I would
[3:11:11.220 --> 3:11:13.220]  you would have to raise some cash
[3:11:13.220 --> 3:11:15.220]  to see dividend yield being paid here pretty soon
[3:11:15.220 --> 3:11:17.220]  and that means you know liquidation
[3:11:17.220 --> 3:11:19.220]  that's what I'm saying and then you're going to have
[3:11:19.220 --> 3:11:21.220]  companies that are defaulting
[3:11:21.220 --> 3:11:23.220]  in Ron's style Bob
[3:11:23.220 --> 3:11:25.220]  absolutely
[3:11:25.220 --> 3:11:27.220]  and you know you're also going to have
[3:11:27.220 --> 3:11:29.220]  redemption in
[3:11:29.220 --> 3:11:31.220]  not only mutual funds but also in hedge funds
[3:11:31.220 --> 3:11:33.220]  and that's what the gentleman was talking about
[3:11:33.220 --> 3:11:35.220]  oh by the way Bob
[3:11:35.220 --> 3:11:37.220]  people keep calling me saying
[3:11:37.220 --> 3:11:39.220]  annuities are
[3:11:39.220 --> 3:11:41.220]  insured are secured
[3:11:41.220 --> 3:11:43.220]  and the experts I talked to
[3:11:43.220 --> 3:11:45.220]  can tell that's just a fable
[3:11:45.220 --> 3:11:47.220]  you're right
[3:11:47.220 --> 3:11:49.220]  but I looked at a portfolio today
[3:11:49.220 --> 3:11:51.220]  that belonged to
[3:11:51.220 --> 3:11:53.220]  a annuity
[3:11:53.220 --> 3:11:55.220]  from Pacific life
[3:11:55.220 --> 3:11:57.220]  and quite frankly it was decent
[3:11:57.220 --> 3:11:59.220]  I mean
[3:11:59.220 --> 3:12:01.220]  they had two investments
[3:12:01.220 --> 3:12:03.220]  6-8%
[3:12:03.220 --> 3:12:05.220]  of the total invested capital
[3:12:05.220 --> 3:12:07.220]  in that particularly annuity
[3:12:07.220 --> 3:12:09.220]  but all the rest of them were 1-2%
[3:12:09.220 --> 3:12:11.220]  so it was really spread out
[3:12:11.220 --> 3:12:13.220]  just about 12% this year
[3:12:13.220 --> 3:12:15.220]  which is not all that bad so
[3:12:15.220 --> 3:12:17.220]  you're going to know what you're buying
[3:12:17.220 --> 3:12:19.220]  some are good some aren't
[3:12:19.220 --> 3:12:21.220]  I've got a question I appreciate your call
[3:12:21.220 --> 3:12:23.220]  Jay
[3:12:23.220 --> 3:12:25.220]  you know the Dow Jones is the top 30
[3:12:25.220 --> 3:12:27.220]  the blue chips and then they take losers out
[3:12:27.220 --> 3:12:29.220]  so it's even fixed
[3:12:29.220 --> 3:12:31.220]  and then you know put in winners
[3:12:31.220 --> 3:12:33.220]  and then that is the benchmark
[3:12:33.220 --> 3:12:35.220]  and you can look at the other
[3:12:35.220 --> 3:12:37.220]  indexes
[3:12:37.220 --> 3:12:39.220]  and I know there's some other groups
[3:12:39.220 --> 3:12:41.220]  that kind of try to give you the real market
[3:12:41.220 --> 3:12:43.220]  but
[3:12:43.220 --> 3:12:45.220]  Bob I mean
[3:12:45.220 --> 3:12:47.220]  compared to how bad the Dow's doing
[3:12:47.220 --> 3:12:49.220]  from 14,000 down to 8,200
[3:12:49.220 --> 3:12:51.220]  right now 8,300
[3:12:51.220 --> 3:12:53.220]  what's the real market down
[3:12:53.220 --> 3:12:55.220]  the whole market in totality
[3:12:55.220 --> 3:12:57.220]  in the last three or four years
[3:12:57.220 --> 3:12:59.220]  well I think the main
[3:12:59.220 --> 3:13:01.220]  divining here
[3:13:01.220 --> 3:13:03.220]  and I think the caller will agree with me
[3:13:03.220 --> 3:13:05.220]  is we don't know how much
[3:13:05.220 --> 3:13:07.220]  money the government has
[3:13:07.220 --> 3:13:09.220]  poured into the market
[3:13:09.220 --> 3:13:11.220]  and if we knew that
[3:13:11.220 --> 3:13:13.220]  we could get an assessment because they're in
[3:13:13.220 --> 3:13:15.220]  every market 24-7
[3:13:15.220 --> 3:13:17.220]  doing what they want to it
[3:13:19.220 --> 3:13:21.220]  so it's an unknown factor
[3:13:21.220 --> 3:13:23.220]  we just don't know
[3:13:23.220 --> 3:13:25.220]  and until changes come
[3:13:25.220 --> 3:13:27.220]  in government we'll never know
[3:13:27.220 --> 3:13:29.220]  until we can access those records
[3:13:29.220 --> 3:13:31.220]  and find out what they've been doing
[3:13:31.220 --> 3:13:33.220]  well notice how the secrecy is first
[3:13:33.220 --> 3:13:35.220]  to fight the Russians
[3:13:35.220 --> 3:13:37.220]  and now it's al-Qaeda
[3:13:37.220 --> 3:13:39.220]  and now it's just every government of every type
[3:13:39.220 --> 3:13:41.220]  you know cops beat your kid to death
[3:13:41.220 --> 3:13:43.220]  they say we're not going to tell you why
[3:13:43.220 --> 3:13:45.220]  or we're not going to release the surveillance footage
[3:13:45.220 --> 3:13:47.220]  I mean it's just government
[3:13:47.220 --> 3:13:49.220]  is a bunch of out of control
[3:13:49.220 --> 3:13:51.220]  employees I mean imagine it's like having
[3:13:51.220 --> 3:13:53.220]  employees who slap you
[3:13:53.220 --> 3:13:55.220]  around and tell you what to do
[3:13:55.220 --> 3:13:57.220]  and then rob you for their paycheck at gunpoint
[3:13:57.220 --> 3:13:59.220]  I mean I'm sick of it
[3:13:59.220 --> 3:14:01.220]  well it's all you know stuffy
[3:14:01.220 --> 3:14:03.220]  type
[3:14:03.220 --> 3:14:05.220]  KGB type stuff
[3:14:05.220 --> 3:14:07.220]  just a gang and that's just exactly what they are
[3:14:07.220 --> 3:14:09.220]  they become animals
[3:14:09.220 --> 3:14:11.220]  Tony and Georgia
[3:14:11.220 --> 3:14:13.220]  you're on the air go ahead
[3:14:15.220 --> 3:14:17.220]  oh hey hello Alex Jones
[3:14:17.220 --> 3:14:19.220]  I'm coming from Georgia
[3:14:19.220 --> 3:14:21.220]  I've seen you got
[3:14:21.220 --> 3:14:23.220]  I've heard you've got a lot of people coming from Georgia
[3:14:23.220 --> 3:14:25.220]  apparently you're waking up a lot of people
[3:14:25.220 --> 3:14:27.220]  around here but I'm sitting here watching on
[3:14:27.220 --> 3:14:29.220]  Yahoo News where they said
[3:14:29.220 --> 3:14:31.220]  oil
[3:14:31.220 --> 3:14:33.220]  dropped into
[3:14:33.220 --> 3:14:35.220]  $60 a barrel so their
[3:14:35.220 --> 3:14:37.220]  OPEC decides to
[3:14:37.220 --> 3:14:39.220]  cut back on production
[3:14:39.220 --> 3:14:41.220]  of oil still doesn't work
[3:14:41.220 --> 3:14:43.220]  excuse me still
[3:14:43.220 --> 3:14:45.220]  still dropped yeah they cut back
[3:14:45.220 --> 3:14:47.220]  cut back on making oil
[3:14:47.220 --> 3:14:49.220]  1.5 million
[3:14:49.220 --> 3:14:51.220]  barrels a day
[3:14:51.220 --> 3:14:53.220]  I don't understand
[3:14:53.220 --> 3:14:55.220]  well they're cutting it to try to get the price back
[3:14:55.220 --> 3:14:57.220]  it's hurting them Bob I tell you Lindsay Williams
[3:14:57.220 --> 3:14:59.220]  has never been a bologna pusher
[3:14:59.220 --> 3:15:01.220]  and that's why when he said in the next few months
[3:15:01.220 --> 3:15:03.220]  oil is going to drop to $60 a barrel
[3:15:03.220 --> 3:15:05.220]  and when he said that it was $148
[3:15:05.220 --> 3:15:07.220]  you know he knows that
[3:15:07.220 --> 3:15:09.220]  Atlantic Ridgefield former CEO
[3:15:09.220 --> 3:15:11.220]  oops
[3:15:11.220 --> 3:15:13.220]  another company had
[3:15:13.220 --> 3:15:15.220]  a bit of good fortune there
[3:15:15.220 --> 3:15:17.220]  because
[3:15:17.220 --> 3:15:19.220]  Lindsay's premise was the
[3:15:19.220 --> 3:15:21.220]  new secret oil fields that
[3:15:21.220 --> 3:15:23.220]  they're going to come online in Indonesia
[3:15:23.220 --> 3:15:25.220]  in the Arctic
[3:15:25.220 --> 3:15:27.220]  and yes we know they're there
[3:15:27.220 --> 3:15:29.220]  seven years away
[3:15:29.220 --> 3:15:31.220]  and yes eventually
[3:15:31.220 --> 3:15:33.220]  oil will go down to $50 a barrel
[3:15:33.220 --> 3:15:35.220]  but in the meantime
[3:15:35.220 --> 3:15:37.220]  we had deleveraging in the market
[3:15:37.220 --> 3:15:39.220]  and we had our government pounding
[3:15:39.220 --> 3:15:41.220]  the energy complex
[3:15:41.220 --> 3:15:43.220]  well obviously it wasn't discovery
[3:15:43.220 --> 3:15:45.220]  and bringing to market in two months oil fields
[3:15:45.220 --> 3:15:47.220]  which they have only publicly
[3:15:47.220 --> 3:15:49.220]  discovered one of them and it's on as big as he said
[3:15:49.220 --> 3:15:51.220]  obviously the guy was going to give him layers of bull
[3:15:51.220 --> 3:15:53.220]  but I mean he really did work
[3:15:53.220 --> 3:15:55.220]  with these people he really does know them
[3:15:55.220 --> 3:15:57.220]  and they were feeding him a line they wanted put out
[3:15:57.220 --> 3:15:59.220]  well perhaps
[3:15:59.220 --> 3:16:01.220]  and
[3:16:01.220 --> 3:16:03.220]  and I'm sure
[3:16:03.220 --> 3:16:05.220]  Lindsay reported
[3:16:05.220 --> 3:16:07.220]  in totally good faith
[3:16:07.220 --> 3:16:09.220]  but
[3:16:09.220 --> 3:16:11.220]  you've got to understand with the
[3:16:11.220 --> 3:16:13.220]  this is psychopolitical warfare
[3:16:13.220 --> 3:16:15.220]  and anything goes
[3:16:15.220 --> 3:16:17.220]  and you know you can be dead right and be wrong
[3:16:17.220 --> 3:16:19.220]  and
[3:16:19.220 --> 3:16:21.220]  we've just seen that
[3:16:21.220 --> 3:16:23.220]  I mean who would have thought
[3:16:23.220 --> 3:16:25.220]  that commodities would have dropped
[3:16:25.220 --> 3:16:27.220]  60-65%
[3:16:27.220 --> 3:16:29.220]  or the price of gold
[3:16:29.220 --> 3:16:31.220]  20 or 25%
[3:16:31.220 --> 3:16:33.220]  and silver 50%
[3:16:33.220 --> 3:16:35.220]  well they're doing that
[3:16:35.220 --> 3:16:37.220]  to try to cover inflation
[3:16:37.220 --> 3:16:39.220]  that's right
[3:16:39.220 --> 3:16:41.220]  but it's a very destructive
[3:16:41.220 --> 3:16:43.220]  absolutely and it's going to come back
[3:16:43.220 --> 3:16:45.220]  like a wild dog only the dog's going to be
[3:16:45.220 --> 3:16:47.220]  rabid this time
[3:16:47.220 --> 3:16:49.220]  well obviously and they know that oh boy
[3:16:49.220 --> 3:16:51.220]  Tony thanks for the call
[3:16:51.220 --> 3:16:53.220]  Prince Sada and Louisiana thanks for holding
[3:16:55.220 --> 3:16:57.220]  thank you for taking my call Mr. Jones
[3:16:57.220 --> 3:16:59.220]  first I want to say that
[3:16:59.220 --> 3:17:01.220]  since April I've listened to your show
[3:17:01.220 --> 3:17:03.220]  on a daily basis and I really do
[3:17:03.220 --> 3:17:05.220]  appreciate the very timely
[3:17:05.220 --> 3:17:07.220]  and relevant information that you share with everyone
[3:17:07.220 --> 3:17:09.220]  well thank you for tuning in
[3:17:09.220 --> 3:17:11.220]  yes sir
[3:17:11.220 --> 3:17:13.220]  I just wanted to brief a comment
[3:17:13.220 --> 3:17:15.220]  on the issue of
[3:17:15.220 --> 3:17:17.220]  Barack Obama and the globalist
[3:17:17.220 --> 3:17:19.220]  and their plan for the New World Order
[3:17:19.220 --> 3:17:21.220]  first I want to say
[3:17:21.220 --> 3:17:23.220]  as a black woman
[3:17:23.220 --> 3:17:25.220]  and a member of the nation of Islam
[3:17:25.220 --> 3:17:27.220]  I can say that we are not deceived
[3:17:27.220 --> 3:17:29.220]  by the globalist
[3:17:29.220 --> 3:17:31.220]  plan to use Mr. Obama
[3:17:31.220 --> 3:17:33.220]  to deceive black people
[3:17:33.220 --> 3:17:35.220]  and to looking away from the real issues
[3:17:35.220 --> 3:17:37.220]  that are going on with us as a people
[3:17:37.220 --> 3:17:39.220]  and I want to also say
[3:17:39.220 --> 3:17:41.220]  that the globalist plan
[3:17:41.220 --> 3:17:43.220]  for the New World Order
[3:17:43.220 --> 3:17:45.220]  is not simply that
[3:17:45.220 --> 3:17:47.220]  they're arrogant but they want to
[3:17:47.220 --> 3:17:49.220]  repopulate the earth of
[3:17:49.220 --> 3:17:51.220]  90% of people
[3:17:51.220 --> 3:17:53.220]  which actually the black and dark of people
[3:17:53.220 --> 3:17:55.220]  outnumber the white race on this earth
[3:17:55.220 --> 3:17:57.220]  the group the New World Order
[3:17:57.220 --> 3:17:59.220]  really wants to wipe out
[3:17:59.220 --> 3:18:01.220]  is everybody of color
[3:18:01.220 --> 3:18:03.220]  and then whites they've stated
[3:18:03.220 --> 3:18:05.220]  are going to be licensed to have children
[3:18:05.220 --> 3:18:07.220]  and most of us are going to be exterminated as well
[3:18:07.220 --> 3:18:09.220]  and I'm sorry you know I talk about that people get freaked out
[3:18:09.220 --> 3:18:11.220]  we have thousands of documents
[3:18:11.220 --> 3:18:13.220]  I mean that's really what they're planning
[3:18:13.220 --> 3:18:15.220]  Bob Chapman
[3:18:15.220 --> 3:18:17.220]  I have good books
[3:18:17.220 --> 3:18:19.220]  that go back to the early 1800s on eugenics
[3:18:19.220 --> 3:18:21.220]  and they've been talking
[3:18:21.220 --> 3:18:23.220]  and scheming this thing in Europe
[3:18:23.220 --> 3:18:25.220]  and particularly the United States for years
[3:18:25.220 --> 3:18:27.220]  and this is where Adolf Hitler got all of his ideas
[3:18:27.220 --> 3:18:29.220]  from Americans
[3:18:29.220 --> 3:18:31.220]  who were into this thing
[3:18:31.220 --> 3:18:33.220]  who was Satanist
[3:18:33.220 --> 3:18:35.220]  yep it's true I mean
[3:18:35.220 --> 3:18:37.220]  we don't make it up folks we just report the facts
[3:18:37.220 --> 3:18:39.220]  Prince Satie any comments on that
[3:18:39.220 --> 3:18:41.220]  yes sir I just want to say that
[3:18:41.220 --> 3:18:43.220]  I agreed with Mr. Chapman
[3:18:43.220 --> 3:18:45.220]  he said that something is going to happen
[3:18:45.220 --> 3:18:47.220]  you know that people are going to be angry
[3:18:47.220 --> 3:18:49.220]  and there's going to be actually
[3:18:49.220 --> 3:18:51.220]  revolution in this country
[3:18:51.220 --> 3:18:53.220]  because when people do wake up
[3:18:53.220 --> 3:18:55.220]  and recognize not only the whites
[3:18:55.220 --> 3:18:57.220]  but the blacks when they recognize
[3:18:57.220 --> 3:18:59.220]  how they've been deceived
[3:18:59.220 --> 3:19:01.220]  that these people can
[3:19:01.220 --> 3:19:03.220]  put in front of us a black man because he's black
[3:19:03.220 --> 3:19:05.220]  and we're supposed to support him
[3:19:05.220 --> 3:19:07.220]  when he has no
[3:19:07.220 --> 3:19:09.220]  interest in our issues
[3:19:09.220 --> 3:19:11.220]  but to serve those of his master
[3:19:11.220 --> 3:19:13.220]  and I also want to say that
[3:19:13.220 --> 3:19:15.220]  once everyone recognized
[3:19:15.220 --> 3:19:17.220]  that the plan of the goblins
[3:19:17.220 --> 3:19:19.220]  to for their new world order
[3:19:19.220 --> 3:19:21.220]  is not going to work
[3:19:21.220 --> 3:19:23.220]  entirely because as the
[3:19:23.220 --> 3:19:25.220]  hold on Prince Satie, hold on Prince Satie
[3:19:25.220 --> 3:19:27.220]  we're going to skip this break we're going to keep talking to you
[3:19:27.220 --> 3:19:29.220]  right now
[3:19:29.220 --> 3:19:31.220]  may I
[3:19:31.220 --> 3:19:33.220]  okay Prince Satie please continue
[3:19:33.220 --> 3:19:35.220]  as I was saying as the Bible
[3:19:35.220 --> 3:19:37.220]  and the Holy Quran make us aware
[3:19:37.220 --> 3:19:39.220]  that of course the rulers
[3:19:39.220 --> 3:19:41.220]  of the darkness of this world
[3:19:41.220 --> 3:19:43.220]  have plans
[3:19:43.220 --> 3:19:45.220]  but what their plans are the Holy Quran teaches us
[3:19:45.220 --> 3:19:47.220]  that and they plan
[3:19:47.220 --> 3:19:49.220]  and as we call them the house of Israel
[3:19:49.220 --> 3:19:51.220]  plans but God plans
[3:19:51.220 --> 3:19:53.220]  and he is the best of planners
[3:19:53.220 --> 3:19:55.220]  so yes we're going to do some suffering
[3:19:55.220 --> 3:19:57.220]  and there's going to be tribulation
[3:19:57.220 --> 3:19:59.220]  in this earth but you can rest
[3:19:59.220 --> 3:20:01.220]  assured that the goblins will not
[3:20:01.220 --> 3:20:03.220]  have the final faith that
[3:20:03.220 --> 3:20:05.220]  the God that creates the heavens and the earth
[3:20:05.220 --> 3:20:09.220]  will have the final faith in this matter
[3:20:09.220 --> 3:20:11.220]  well there's no doubt absolutely right
[3:20:11.220 --> 3:20:13.220]  yeah there's no doubt
[3:20:13.220 --> 3:20:15.220]  even if you're an atheist out there and they think we're all nuts
[3:20:15.220 --> 3:20:17.220]  the elite really do believe they're worshipping Lucifer
[3:20:17.220 --> 3:20:19.220]  they really believe they're setting up a world government
[3:20:19.220 --> 3:20:21.220]  they really believe that they
[3:20:21.220 --> 3:20:23.220]  for their god to kill the majority of us
[3:20:23.220 --> 3:20:25.220]  and we're in a lot of trouble
[3:20:25.220 --> 3:20:27.220]  and you know when you understand
[3:20:27.220 --> 3:20:29.220]  that psychopathic killers run everything
[3:20:29.220 --> 3:20:31.220]  then everything starts making sense
[3:20:31.220 --> 3:20:33.220]  Bob you're trying to say something
[3:20:33.220 --> 3:20:35.220]  no no I think she's covered it beautifully
[3:20:35.220 --> 3:20:37.220]  and I think it's important
[3:20:37.220 --> 3:20:39.220]  that we stick together as Americans
[3:20:39.220 --> 3:20:41.220]  not as
[3:20:41.220 --> 3:20:43.220]  black brown
[3:20:43.220 --> 3:20:45.220]  or white Americans all together
[3:20:45.220 --> 3:20:47.220]  yeah it's really bad
[3:20:47.220 --> 3:20:49.220]  you know as a black woman
[3:20:49.220 --> 3:20:51.220]  is it painful
[3:20:51.220 --> 3:20:53.220]  painful for you not just to see black folks
[3:20:53.220 --> 3:20:55.220]  but some of the other people being completely
[3:20:55.220 --> 3:20:57.220]  suckered by Barack Obama
[3:20:57.220 --> 3:20:59.220]  and again I'm not saying McCain's good either
[3:20:59.220 --> 3:21:01.220]  it's just the fact that Obama
[3:21:01.220 --> 3:21:03.220]  is a lot slicker and he's really
[3:21:03.220 --> 3:21:05.220]  suckering a lot of people
[3:21:05.220 --> 3:21:07.220]  and I feel sorry for him because they're in for a rude awakening
[3:21:07.220 --> 3:21:09.220]  well for me Mr. Jones
[3:21:09.220 --> 3:21:11.220]  as I said as a black woman
[3:21:11.220 --> 3:21:13.220]  a member of the nation of Islam
[3:21:13.220 --> 3:21:15.220]  we're not deceived by what the
[3:21:15.220 --> 3:21:17.220]  the rulers of this world do
[3:21:17.220 --> 3:21:19.220]  we understand that Mr. Obama
[3:21:19.220 --> 3:21:21.220]  is being used again
[3:21:21.220 --> 3:21:23.220]  to deceive black people so we're aware
[3:21:23.220 --> 3:21:25.220]  that God has
[3:21:25.220 --> 3:21:27.220]  his plan and that what the rulers
[3:21:27.220 --> 3:21:29.220]  are planning but I do want to say this
[3:21:29.220 --> 3:21:31.220]  that there is a lot
[3:21:31.220 --> 3:21:33.220]  to what these people say
[3:21:33.220 --> 3:21:35.220]  when they talk about aliens and all these things
[3:21:35.220 --> 3:21:37.220]  the rulers of this world
[3:21:37.220 --> 3:21:39.220]  know that there's
[3:21:39.220 --> 3:21:41.220]  something coming up upon this world
[3:21:41.220 --> 3:21:43.220]  and they know the scriptures
[3:21:43.220 --> 3:21:45.220]  and they know it but instead of
[3:21:45.220 --> 3:21:47.220]  telling the people the truth
[3:21:47.220 --> 3:21:49.220]  they put it in terms of what the people understand
[3:21:49.220 --> 3:21:51.220]  but I say to you Mr. Jones
[3:21:51.220 --> 3:21:53.220]  and to your audience that
[3:21:53.220 --> 3:21:55.220]  there is something to what these people are saying
[3:21:55.220 --> 3:21:57.220]  and that God
[3:21:57.220 --> 3:21:59.220]  in essence what we're witnessing
[3:21:59.220 --> 3:22:01.220]  I know this may not be
[3:22:01.220 --> 3:22:03.220]  something that everyone wants to hear
[3:22:03.220 --> 3:22:05.220]  no no it's very
[3:22:05.220 --> 3:22:07.220]  sure no no it's very interesting
[3:22:07.220 --> 3:22:09.220]  and we're glad that you're tuned in
[3:22:09.220 --> 3:22:11.220]  thank you I'm going to try to hurry here
[3:22:11.220 --> 3:22:13.220]  because I guess it's a leave us in about 6, 7, 8 minutes
[3:22:13.220 --> 3:22:15.220]  Melissa in North Carolina
[3:22:15.220 --> 3:22:17.220]  and then Danny, Tony and Mike that'll be it for calls
[3:22:17.220 --> 3:22:19.220]  go ahead Melissa
[3:22:19.220 --> 3:22:21.220]  hey yes thanks for having me on
[3:22:21.220 --> 3:22:23.220]  I want to tell you I'm in North Carolina
[3:22:23.220 --> 3:22:25.220]  and I have a statement
[3:22:25.220 --> 3:22:27.220]  on what took violin
[3:22:27.220 --> 3:22:29.220]  the revolution
[3:22:29.220 --> 3:22:31.220]  I was trying to get on that
[3:22:31.220 --> 3:22:33.220]  ballot to write in his name
[3:22:33.220 --> 3:22:35.220]  and his campaign told me
[3:22:35.220 --> 3:22:37.220]  that North Carolina had taught him a specific
[3:22:37.220 --> 3:22:39.220]  date to have their signatures
[3:22:39.220 --> 3:22:41.220]  turned in to be on the ballot
[3:22:41.220 --> 3:22:43.220]  and then they turned around
[3:22:43.220 --> 3:22:45.220]  and lied to them and told them that they
[3:22:45.220 --> 3:22:47.220]  missed the cutoff date to get on the ballot
[3:22:47.220 --> 3:22:49.220]  and so this
[3:22:49.220 --> 3:22:51.220]  well I can't write his name in
[3:22:51.220 --> 3:22:53.220]  the third party guy
[3:22:53.220 --> 3:22:55.220]  that is on there I don't even know his name
[3:22:55.220 --> 3:22:57.220]  I don't know anything about him
[3:22:57.220 --> 3:22:59.220]  I'm battling with
[3:22:59.220 --> 3:23:01.220]  should I vote for third party
[3:23:01.220 --> 3:23:03.220]  not knowing who I'm voting for
[3:23:03.220 --> 3:23:05.220]  I don't want a hand in the evil of voting
[3:23:05.220 --> 3:23:07.220]  for any of them
[3:23:07.220 --> 3:23:09.220]  I just can't bring myself to vote
[3:23:09.220 --> 3:23:11.220]  or to be a smart aleck
[3:23:11.220 --> 3:23:13.220]  in protest to write to that ball's name
[3:23:13.220 --> 3:23:15.220]  in just even though it doesn't count
[3:23:15.220 --> 3:23:17.220]  they won't even care
[3:23:17.220 --> 3:23:19.220]  I mean only the pollers will see that
[3:23:19.220 --> 3:23:21.220]  and most of them are thinking about
[3:23:21.220 --> 3:23:23.220]  squares or whatever and won't even really see it
[3:23:23.220 --> 3:23:25.220]  Bob Chapman you want to comment on that
[3:23:25.220 --> 3:23:27.220]  I would write
[3:23:27.220 --> 3:23:29.220]  I would vote for the third party candidate
[3:23:29.220 --> 3:23:31.220]  I think that's the best of all the options
[3:23:31.220 --> 3:23:33.220]  he certainly
[3:23:33.220 --> 3:23:35.220]  can't be any worse
[3:23:35.220 --> 3:23:37.220]  for the other two
[3:23:37.220 --> 3:23:39.220]  that's right every election we see the numbers
[3:23:39.220 --> 3:23:41.220]  for third party folks getting higher and higher
[3:23:41.220 --> 3:23:43.220]  let's go back here to the full audience
[3:23:45.220 --> 3:23:47.220]  Melissa was asking about
[3:23:47.220 --> 3:23:49.220]  not liking either party
[3:23:49.220 --> 3:23:51.220]  so vote for third party
[3:23:51.220 --> 3:23:53.220]  and we were saying yeah build the numbers
[3:23:53.220 --> 3:23:55.220]  of any legitimate third party movement
[3:23:55.220 --> 3:23:57.220]  unless it's the communists or something
[3:23:57.220 --> 3:23:59.220]  anything else Melissa
[3:23:59.220 --> 3:24:01.220]  have you heard I know he's in most of the other states
[3:24:01.220 --> 3:24:03.220]  on the ballot
[3:24:03.220 --> 3:24:05.220]  I haven't heard a lot about him
[3:24:05.220 --> 3:24:07.220]  but he does know about the new world order
[3:24:07.220 --> 3:24:09.220]  and he says he's against
[3:24:09.220 --> 3:24:11.220]  all of what they're doing
[3:24:11.220 --> 3:24:13.220]  yes sir openly
[3:24:13.220 --> 3:24:15.220]  no he's a great guy I know Chuck
[3:24:15.220 --> 3:24:17.220]  and he's a great candidate
[3:24:17.220 --> 3:24:19.220]  a lot of people say that they're going to vote for him
[3:24:19.220 --> 3:24:21.220]  because I think
[3:24:21.220 --> 3:24:23.220]  that everybody should vote for him
[3:24:23.220 --> 3:24:25.220]  even the ones that
[3:24:25.220 --> 3:24:27.220]  have him on their ballot
[3:24:27.220 --> 3:24:29.220]  Ron Paul's endorsed him and so I appreciate your call
[3:24:29.220 --> 3:24:31.220]  Danny in Texas
[3:24:31.220 --> 3:24:33.220]  you're on the air go ahead
[3:24:33.220 --> 3:24:35.220]  well
[3:24:35.220 --> 3:24:37.220]  Alex I don't know if I'm
[3:24:37.220 --> 3:24:39.220]  talking to the current issues today
[3:24:39.220 --> 3:24:41.220]  but I just wanted
[3:24:41.220 --> 3:24:43.220]  to tell you how much I appreciate you and your show
[3:24:43.220 --> 3:24:45.220]  I just discovered you a couple weeks ago
[3:24:45.220 --> 3:24:47.220]  and
[3:24:47.220 --> 3:24:49.220]  I'm actually just up the road from here about 25
[3:24:49.220 --> 3:24:51.220]  30 miles
[3:24:51.220 --> 3:24:53.220]  I've read about
[3:24:53.220 --> 3:24:55.220]  the tri-lateral commission
[3:24:55.220 --> 3:24:57.220]  back in
[3:24:57.220 --> 3:24:59.220]  the early 80s
[3:24:59.220 --> 3:25:01.220]  as I guess
[3:25:01.220 --> 3:25:03.220]  an investigative reporter had written
[3:25:03.220 --> 3:25:05.220]  an article in
[3:25:05.220 --> 3:25:07.220]  Penthouse magazine
[3:25:07.220 --> 3:25:09.220]  and I think the problem
[3:25:09.220 --> 3:25:11.220]  was that he was trying to tie it to the
[3:25:11.220 --> 3:25:13.220]  JFK assassination
[3:25:13.220 --> 3:25:15.220]  and speaking of that
[3:25:15.220 --> 3:25:17.220]  I
[3:25:17.220 --> 3:25:19.220]  tried to get in on your show yesterday
[3:25:19.220 --> 3:25:21.220]  I just wanted to almost sit down
[3:25:21.220 --> 3:25:23.220]  and cry when I
[3:25:23.220 --> 3:25:25.220]  saw what you had posted
[3:25:25.220 --> 3:25:27.220]  and I've heard so long
[3:25:27.220 --> 3:25:29.220]  and been so insulted
[3:25:29.220 --> 3:25:31.220]  for so many years
[3:25:31.220 --> 3:25:33.220]  that by the long gunman theory
[3:25:33.220 --> 3:25:35.220]  that
[3:25:35.220 --> 3:25:37.220]  it was just a real blessing
[3:25:37.220 --> 3:25:39.220]  we posted, we posted E. Howard Hunt
[3:25:39.220 --> 3:25:41.220]  exclusive
[3:25:41.220 --> 3:25:43.220]  video of him talking about how
[3:25:43.220 --> 3:25:45.220]  the government did kill JFK
[3:25:45.220 --> 3:25:47.220]  not just the audio but the video
[3:25:47.220 --> 3:25:49.220]  this has been in the Rolling Stone magazine
[3:25:49.220 --> 3:25:51.220]  and no other mainstream media
[3:25:51.220 --> 3:25:53.220]  picked it up but we
[3:25:53.220 --> 3:25:55.220]  exclusively two days ago released that
[3:25:55.220 --> 3:25:57.220]  and in the comments section at infowars.com
[3:25:57.220 --> 3:25:59.220]  and on the YouTube comments
[3:25:59.220 --> 3:26:01.220]  there's guys going this is just some drunk
[3:26:01.220 --> 3:26:03.220]  bum they picked up
[3:26:03.220 --> 3:26:05.220]  off the side of the road look at how he's
[3:26:05.220 --> 3:26:07.220]  having trouble talking
[3:26:07.220 --> 3:26:09.220]  he did two deathbed confessions
[3:26:09.220 --> 3:26:11.220]  10 times he thought he was going to die
[3:26:11.220 --> 3:26:13.220]  he's propped up in a chair
[3:26:13.220 --> 3:26:15.220]  he beat cancer 10 times
[3:26:15.220 --> 3:26:17.220]  he was obviously pretty evil
[3:26:17.220 --> 3:26:19.220]  there's a sniper in World War II
[3:26:19.220 --> 3:26:21.220]  in China against the Japanese
[3:26:21.220 --> 3:26:23.220]  and then OSS and CIA
[3:26:23.220 --> 3:26:25.220]  I mean E. Howard Hunt
[3:26:25.220 --> 3:26:27.220]  he died last year
[3:26:27.220 --> 3:26:29.220]  and he had all his teeth removed
[3:26:29.220 --> 3:26:31.220]  part of his jaw removed
[3:26:31.220 --> 3:26:33.220]  he had throat cancer and a bunch of his throat removed
[3:26:33.220 --> 3:26:35.220]  he's propped up in a chair
[3:26:35.220 --> 3:26:37.220]  can barely talk
[3:26:37.220 --> 3:26:39.220]  sit there on the site saying
[3:26:39.220 --> 3:26:41.220]  we've made it up
[3:26:41.220 --> 3:26:43.220]  and that it's a bum
[3:26:43.220 --> 3:26:45.220]  who's drunk
[3:26:45.220 --> 3:26:47.220]  you know what you're going to be old men someday
[3:26:47.220 --> 3:26:49.220]  you're going to be 87 years old or whatever
[3:26:49.220 --> 3:26:51.220]  with cancer all over your ass
[3:26:51.220 --> 3:26:53.220]  and let's see if you can sit up and do a deathbed
[3:26:53.220 --> 3:26:55.220]  confession and another thing is
[3:26:55.220 --> 3:26:57.220]  don't just
[3:26:57.220 --> 3:26:59.220]  they instinctively just lie
[3:26:59.220 --> 3:27:01.220]  they always just instinctively
[3:27:01.220 --> 3:27:03.220]  lie to themselves and just say
[3:27:03.220 --> 3:27:05.220]  we're lying when it's admitted it's E. Howard Hunt
[3:27:05.220 --> 3:27:07.220]  it's an incredible exclusive
[3:27:07.220 --> 3:27:09.220]  and instead of saying we're right
[3:27:09.220 --> 3:27:11.220]  they just say oh that's just some drunk bum
[3:27:11.220 --> 3:27:13.220]  Bob Chapman
[3:27:13.220 --> 3:27:15.220]  I agree
[3:27:15.220 --> 3:27:17.220]  and I've seen
[3:27:17.220 --> 3:27:19.220]  even after what Hunt did
[3:27:19.220 --> 3:27:21.220]  you know for years he lived down in Mexico
[3:27:21.220 --> 3:27:23.220]  and then he came back
[3:27:23.220 --> 3:27:25.220]  and he was instrumental
[3:27:25.220 --> 3:27:27.220]  in a lawsuit
[3:27:27.220 --> 3:27:29.220]  against Liberty Lobby in the spotlight
[3:27:29.220 --> 3:27:31.220]  I mean this guy was really evil
[3:27:31.220 --> 3:27:33.220]  and then he comes out
[3:27:33.220 --> 3:27:35.220]  and says okay it's all true
[3:27:35.220 --> 3:27:37.220]  on his deathbed
[3:27:37.220 --> 3:27:39.220]  and they're making fun of him
[3:27:39.220 --> 3:27:41.220]  I mean it's him there
[3:27:41.220 --> 3:27:43.220]  with a air hose
[3:27:43.220 --> 3:27:45.220]  in his nose in a hospital bed
[3:27:45.220 --> 3:27:47.220]  it's all there and they go
[3:27:47.220 --> 3:27:49.220]  it's just a drunk bum it doesn't matter
[3:27:49.220 --> 3:27:51.220]  I mean we give people absolute proof
[3:27:51.220 --> 3:27:53.220]  and they just yeah whatever
[3:27:55.220 --> 3:27:57.220]  Bob do you ever get sick of just absolute denial
[3:27:57.220 --> 3:27:59.220]  by people
[3:27:59.220 --> 3:28:01.220]  it's hard but you know
[3:28:01.220 --> 3:28:03.220]  they're human
[3:28:03.220 --> 3:28:05.220]  and we just got to keep on working

[3:28:09.220 --> 3:28:11.220]  and come into action

[3:34:49.900 --> 3:34:53.420]  in to take a few final calls from Tony and Mike and a few others but for a
[3:34:53.420 --> 3:34:58.860]  little while here I wanted to get Steve Shank up today because while you see
[3:34:58.860 --> 3:35:04.300]  commodities falling there are shortages of all sorts of things like staple food
[3:35:04.300 --> 3:35:08.260]  gold silver and that shows the manipulation prices falling but
[3:35:08.260 --> 3:35:13.340]  shortages that's that's that's price-fixing but but food prices aren't
[3:35:13.340 --> 3:35:16.580]  going down like other commodities they're actually going up and since he's the
[3:35:16.580 --> 3:35:20.660]  longest continually operated storeable foods company in the nation almost 28
[3:35:20.660 --> 3:35:24.300]  years and great folks that I get my storeable foods from as part of the
[3:35:24.300 --> 3:35:29.780]  economic coverage today wanted to get Steve Shank up from eFoodsDirect.com
[3:35:29.780 --> 3:35:37.060]  the J. Michael Stevens group to go over what he's witnessing right now in food
[3:35:37.060 --> 3:35:41.220]  preparation and in the market Steve Shank thanks for coming on hey thanks
[3:35:41.220 --> 3:35:47.900]  Alex I'm glad that we got together because right now this last week and
[3:35:47.900 --> 3:35:54.180]  right at present is the most dangerous time we've ever had in this country I'm
[3:35:54.180 --> 3:36:00.340]  talking about absolute dangerous because you know you've all heard the
[3:36:00.340 --> 3:36:03.700]  old story about how to cook a frog if you throw them in boiling water you'll
[3:36:03.700 --> 3:36:07.740]  jump right back out but if we put them in cool water then slowly turn up the
[3:36:07.740 --> 3:36:12.220]  heat he's going to be cooked before he knows what's happening that's that
[3:36:12.220 --> 3:36:17.380]  desensitization Alex is exactly what's happening to our people yeah I know it
[3:36:17.380 --> 3:36:21.220]  is training us up and down the markets commodities up and down meanwhile
[3:36:21.220 --> 3:36:25.620]  Main Street is just shutting down absolutely and and what's happening
[3:36:25.620 --> 3:36:31.780]  what's happening is the event that are well for example the stock market
[3:36:31.780 --> 3:36:37.660]  drop that we had yesterday and today okay any other time that would have been
[3:36:37.660 --> 3:36:41.340]  newsworthy to the point that they know on that for a whole week and everybody
[3:36:41.340 --> 3:36:47.220]  go into a panic but we've had so many of them so many ups so many downs we have
[3:36:47.220 --> 3:36:51.860]  it down it's a big crash the first one was a big deal and and people just got
[3:36:51.860 --> 3:36:55.060]  all all freaked out and started putting in food supplies knew what was
[3:36:55.060 --> 3:36:59.660]  happening and then they kind of got it resolved they came back up again and
[3:36:59.660 --> 3:37:03.460]  everybody stops and says well gee it might be better and then it goes up and
[3:37:03.460 --> 3:37:07.660]  down and up and down it's just like it's just like cooking a frog very simply
[3:37:07.660 --> 3:37:12.820]  what's happening is our people are becoming desensitized to these extremes
[3:37:12.820 --> 3:37:16.500]  that normally it would shake them up and they they get their their tailing
[3:37:16.500 --> 3:37:20.460]  but we just had a caller who was a stockbroker and of course Bob Chavin
[3:37:20.460 --> 3:37:24.420]  saying the same thing we're being trained for the sucker punch I don't know
[3:37:24.420 --> 3:37:28.420]  when it's coming but regardless of Wall Street and all the people focus on that
[3:37:28.420 --> 3:37:32.180]  too much and it's a deep trouble way down today yeah the main issue is their
[3:37:32.180 --> 3:37:35.500]  hyperinflating the currency the industry is falling apart the banks are
[3:37:35.500 --> 3:37:39.900]  taking over dictatorial power and told Congress that they won't let Congress see
[3:37:39.900 --> 3:37:44.820]  who they gave the money to I mean it's just lawless government now and then
[3:37:44.820 --> 3:37:49.100]  and that's why I think people should get self-sufficient well the fact is is
[3:37:49.100 --> 3:37:52.980]  that you know we've been talking about when you and I get together one of the
[3:37:52.980 --> 3:37:58.140]  main things that we keep talking about is that we have guaranteed hyperinflation
[3:37:58.140 --> 3:38:03.340]  coming at us and we have guaranteed now the mainstream press is even saying
[3:38:03.340 --> 3:38:09.080]  okay gas prices are going down remember you and I talked last time and and we
[3:38:09.080 --> 3:38:14.140]  said gas prices will go down now they're down into the twos you know below
[3:38:14.140 --> 3:38:19.140]  three dollars food prices actually you're the only person I know that said six
[3:38:19.140 --> 3:38:23.980]  months ago gold was going to drop and it has no doubt later it's going to go
[3:38:23.980 --> 3:38:26.500]  way back up all the economists are saying because the hyperinflation when it
[3:38:26.500 --> 3:38:29.540]  kicks in but how did you know because Bob Chapman didn't even see that one
[3:38:29.540 --> 3:38:36.100]  coming well the reason that that I knew was the fact that food oddly enough
[3:38:36.100 --> 3:38:42.540]  most people don't realize it but food and food prices and availability really
[3:38:42.540 --> 3:38:48.300]  sets the value of every single thing in our economy including the gold and what's
[3:38:48.300 --> 3:38:53.340]  happening is the food is continuing to increase in in price and I'm not too
[3:38:53.340 --> 3:39:00.300]  sure but what if it continues at the rate of still it's going and hyperinflation
[3:39:00.300 --> 3:39:07.460]  kicks in and adds to the skyrocketing prices of food I'm not too sure that
[3:39:07.460 --> 3:39:13.380]  gold will ever skyrocket like everybody thinks it will because if food becomes a
[3:39:13.380 --> 3:39:19.140]  significant issue gold will never reach its its upper limits and people that are
[3:39:19.140 --> 3:39:23.420]  sitting there with gold will have to get converted over to food at some point in
[3:39:23.420 --> 3:39:28.220]  time otherwise when food establishes the value of gold gold will almost have no
[3:39:28.220 --> 3:39:32.940]  value whatsoever now well the point of having gold is sure sure what it's
[3:39:32.940 --> 3:39:35.980]  going to happen well we have to look at all avenues here but the point of gold
[3:39:35.980 --> 3:39:39.780]  is for assets it's a lot better than a bunch of money sitting in the bank or
[3:39:39.780 --> 3:39:42.780]  the stock market oh absolutely because you're physically holding it but but I
[3:39:42.780 --> 3:39:48.340]  agree water filters come first and then food and guns absolutely and you got to
[3:39:48.340 --> 3:39:50.940]  have water got to have food and got to have guns to protect it and you got to
[3:39:50.940 --> 3:39:55.100]  have a will to use it and with all the north com and the government saying
[3:39:55.100 --> 3:39:57.380]  they're gearing up for all this and saying they're getting ready for civil
[3:39:57.380 --> 3:40:00.940]  disturbances what are they getting ready for why are they getting ready for
[3:40:00.940 --> 3:40:05.980]  mass rioting what do you see have happening steve shank well the reason
[3:40:05.980 --> 3:40:10.940]  that the reason that mass rioting will occur is over food i'll guarantee it
[3:40:10.940 --> 3:40:14.340]  just already having worldwide riots we're already having worldwide riots over
[3:40:14.340 --> 3:40:19.900]  food yep and and the thing that that we're going to be dealing with the
[3:40:19.900 --> 3:40:24.220]  reason that i talked about the cook and frogs thing is what's happening what
[3:40:24.220 --> 3:40:30.780]  we're seeing with orders is a big crisis hit and everybody orders food
[3:40:30.780 --> 3:40:35.020]  like crazy you and i talk and we talk about what's going on and we've got
[3:40:35.020 --> 3:40:40.940]  food orders coming in and they're going like mad and then all of a sudden it
[3:40:40.940 --> 3:40:45.660]  reverses and people are being bounced back and forth with the stock market with
[3:40:45.660 --> 3:40:50.380]  the housing situation with with the gas prices and everything to the point where
[3:40:50.380 --> 3:40:54.780]  they freeze up and all as soon as something starts looking decent again
[3:40:54.780 --> 3:41:02.340]  all the orders for food stop and then it takes another bigger and harder blow but
[3:41:02.340 --> 3:41:06.300]  the fact is that there are so many of them coming so fast that eventually the
[3:41:06.300 --> 3:41:10.660]  the population is going to get so desensitized that they won't they will
[3:41:10.660 --> 3:41:15.900]  not move until they actually get cooked in the squad and absolutely and to be
[3:41:15.900 --> 3:41:19.020]  clear this is the business you're in and the reason you've been the name in
[3:41:19.020 --> 3:41:22.500]  it and been in it for 28 years almost is because you really believe in all this
[3:41:22.500 --> 3:41:26.180]  and you believe in self-sufficiency and and and not being beholden to the
[3:41:26.180 --> 3:41:28.780]  government and you've seen what they did in the Soviet Union and China using
[3:41:28.780 --> 3:41:32.820]  foods a weapon and what the UN has said and regardless of what's coming we know
[3:41:32.820 --> 3:41:37.140]  we're in crazy times and and and we know a lot of strange things are happening we
[3:41:37.140 --> 3:41:41.780]  know hyperinflation is here we in bizarre sneak attacks on Russia and Iran
[3:41:41.780 --> 3:41:45.580]  stuff and these two other wars I mean I really believe people should get
[3:41:45.580 --> 3:41:49.300]  storable food and I so I go out and I find the best sponsor there is people I
[3:41:49.300 --> 3:41:54.660]  decided to buy it from and you're here and so it's your sponsor so it's win
[3:41:54.660 --> 3:41:58.700]  win win win and it's high quality freeze-dried and dehydrated food and it's
[3:41:58.700 --> 3:42:02.940]  very inexpensively priced and you're a zealot you believe in this because you
[3:42:02.940 --> 3:42:07.700]  understand history and so it's just at all all the way around a good thing to
[3:42:07.700 --> 3:42:11.180]  do tell folks about some of the food packages you get how they get into
[3:42:11.180 --> 3:42:14.500]  some storeable food now and then they're secure we don't do this because we live
[3:42:14.500 --> 3:42:17.620]  in fear we do this because we know that's a real world and we want to be
[3:42:17.620 --> 3:42:23.820]  prepared if you are independent you then can be fearless Alex but the fact is
[3:42:23.820 --> 3:42:28.820]  that they put together one-year supplies and you do multiple of that they
[3:42:28.820 --> 3:42:34.780]  have a grab-and-go kit which is a two-month supply three meals a day and
[3:42:34.780 --> 3:42:39.260]  it's really good quality food it's the same quality that you eat the only
[3:42:39.260 --> 3:42:44.260]  difference is a little bit dried and as a result of that it retains all of us
[3:42:44.260 --> 3:42:46.900]  nutrition flavoring you cook with it just like you do straight out of the
[3:42:46.900 --> 3:42:51.660]  garden but I you know that the thing that's happening the thing that I'm
[3:42:51.660 --> 3:42:55.780]  concerned about is right now you know we we quoted some statistics last time
[3:42:55.780 --> 3:43:00.900]  30% of the population is having to decide whether they they buy food or pay
[3:43:00.900 --> 3:43:08.660]  other necessities now it's up to 40% and that happened in three weeks and 60% of
[3:43:08.660 --> 3:43:13.260]  American families right now on a recent New York Times survey
[3:43:13.260 --> 3:43:17.740]  60% of American families are cutting back on the quality and quality of their
[3:43:17.740 --> 3:43:23.300]  food they've got and unless families that are sitting out there you know
[3:43:23.300 --> 3:43:27.740]  waiting to see what's going to happen move and get food in their possession
[3:43:27.740 --> 3:43:32.460]  we now have a situation with the minister Colin Powell and Joe Biden the
[3:43:32.460 --> 3:43:37.900]  vice presidential candidate both making a statement that there is going to be a
[3:43:37.900 --> 3:43:43.220]  generated crisis shortly after the new president which they're assuming as
[3:43:43.220 --> 3:43:48.340]  Obama and Powell even even listed the day the 22nd or 23rd but says he won't
[3:43:48.340 --> 3:43:55.340]  tell us what it is yeah but absolutely Steve give them the number and give them
[3:43:55.340 --> 3:43:58.980]  the website for people that do want to check into what you have to offer okay
[3:43:58.980 --> 3:44:07.500]  it's 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 on the web at
[3:44:07.500 --> 3:44:13.340]  e-foodsdirect.com now we're putting up some information about this and what's happening
[3:44:13.340 --> 3:44:17.780]  but e-foodsdirect.com you can get a bunch of information but the main thing
[3:44:17.780 --> 3:44:25.980]  is families have to unfreeze from from all of the all of the whipsaw that they've
[3:44:25.980 --> 3:44:29.740]  got from all these things going up and down and that first of all we have a
[3:44:29.740 --> 3:44:33.300]  disaster and then they say it's going to be fixed and then it's not fixed and
[3:44:33.300 --> 3:44:37.940]  then we have another disaster and they're going to get so desensitized that
[3:44:37.940 --> 3:44:42.180]  they don't do anything until it's too late it's just like the frogs being
[3:44:42.180 --> 3:44:46.620]  cooked and that's the biggest danger that we have right now Alex it is e-foods
[3:44:46.620 --> 3:44:52.100]  direct.com just a letter e-foodsdirect.com big banners up at infowars.com
[3:44:52.100 --> 3:44:58.780]  and prisonplanet.com at the top of the page a very important sponsor great guy
[3:44:58.780 --> 3:45:01.900]  we bring you the sponsors we believe in this is high quality
[3:45:01.900 --> 3:45:05.620]  freeze to ride and dehydrated food stores for more than 10 years in climate
[3:45:05.620 --> 3:45:10.260]  control 10 years in your garage erratic if it's not climate controlled and it's
[3:45:10.260 --> 3:45:14.500]  again just the mindset of getting prepared exactly not living in fear
[3:45:14.500 --> 3:45:17.700]  living in powered I mean I don't want to afraid at night somebody breaks in my
[3:45:17.700 --> 3:45:22.020]  house I got an instant access pistol safe in half the rooms and I'm going to
[3:45:22.020 --> 3:45:26.860]  gun them down and if riots start there's no food there's a 10% chance you
[3:45:26.860 --> 3:45:30.020]  you've got to be ready and unfortunately it's more than that and I'm going to sit
[3:45:30.020 --> 3:45:32.540]  there anybody tries to take my food they're dead in a hammer so I'm taking
[3:45:32.540 --> 3:45:37.340]  care of my children and you know it it's it's that simple that's my philosophy and
[3:45:37.340 --> 3:45:43.940]  I know that Steve's philosophy Steve give folks the number 800-409-5633
[3:45:43.940 --> 3:45:50.700]  800-409-5633 and folks will be there but e-foods direct.com and people will be

[3:45:59.740 --> 3:46:05.580]  take a message on the telephone or 24 hours of course the web is 24 hours if
[3:46:05.580 --> 3:46:09.420]  you have specific questions that we keep normal hours which would be about 12
[3:46:09.420 --> 3:46:12.740]  hours a day that's right so so about 12 hours a day you've got your expert

[3:46:17.060 --> 3:46:21.140]  just don't procrastinate Steve shank thanks for popping in with us today take
[3:46:21.140 --> 3:46:26.020]  care Alex yeah I know that guy behind the scenes he really really is into all
[3:46:26.020 --> 3:46:29.500]  of this I mean he's up in Utah so that's those folks are you know really
[3:46:29.500 --> 3:46:32.980]  always into being prepared and being ready and I think it makes sense I mean
[3:46:32.980 --> 3:46:37.700]  I mean it's really stupid to not be prepared I mean how do we get
[3:46:37.700 --> 3:46:41.820]  convinced all of our ancestors I don't care if it was in Africa or Japan or
[3:46:41.820 --> 3:46:46.540]  England or Germany they were into storing food squirrels do it chipmunks do
[3:46:46.540 --> 3:46:53.300]  it ants do it birds do it I mean oh I'm just gonna trust the grocery store
[3:46:53.300 --> 3:46:58.220]  especially people living like Chicago or New York just these concrete jungles
[3:46:58.220 --> 3:47:03.740]  and you know there's a power outage and people are rioting in an hour and robbing
[3:47:03.740 --> 3:47:08.460]  everything I mean I don't know man it's just a good feeling to have storable
[3:47:08.460 --> 3:47:11.620]  food not to worry about it I'm gonna come back in the final segment and jam in
[3:47:11.620 --> 3:47:19.580]  a few calls here but I spilt my lunch on this or I would show you this news
[3:47:19.580 --> 3:47:25.700]  article it's it's it's up on it's up on info wars.com it's an info wars.net
[3:47:25.700 --> 3:47:30.620]  story by Steve Watson Pentagon wants pack of robots to detect non-cooperative
[3:47:30.620 --> 3:47:36.180]  humans and it's mainstream news and it's got the Pentagon purchase order it says
[3:47:36.180 --> 3:47:40.780]  to deal with citizens that don't submit non-cooperative human subjects for
[3:47:40.780 --> 3:47:46.220]  domestic use against the American people in pursuit and evasion scenarios and
[3:47:46.220 --> 3:47:49.460]  they've got all these all-terrain robots developed for Mars rovers and others
[3:47:49.460 --> 3:47:53.540]  that ones are like big dogs that run on four legs they got swords that have
[3:47:53.540 --> 3:47:56.980]  already killed a lot of people in Iraq the little armored robots with grenade
[3:47:56.980 --> 3:48:02.020]  launchers and machine guns on them and nerve gas and people laugh and say that's
[3:48:02.020 --> 3:48:05.700]  a wimpy thing I'll just shoot that these are the early generations they're
[3:48:05.700 --> 3:48:11.300]  pumping a lot of money into this and they're they're they're transferring to
[3:48:11.300 --> 3:48:20.180]  right now more and more control of aircraft and and and drone systems to
[3:48:20.180 --> 3:48:24.060]  where they're pilotless but not just pilotless with their computer program and see the
[3:48:24.060 --> 3:48:27.420]  elite can order troops to go shoot their grandma they may not do it but robots
[3:48:27.420 --> 3:48:32.660]  will follow orders and it allows very small central groups of people to do
[3:48:32.660 --> 3:48:36.860]  things with remote with remote control aircraft and things like 9-11 I'll go
[3:48:36.860 --> 3:48:43.940]  ahead and show you the article but there's a picture of the robots right
[3:48:43.940 --> 3:48:48.540]  there on screen that's just some of them and there's a whole other issue and a
[3:48:48.540 --> 3:48:56.860]  whole other area to this it's the denials it's people making jokes and saying
[3:48:56.860 --> 3:49:01.980]  oh look at Alex for mongering the robots are gonna get me listen they really
[3:49:01.980 --> 3:49:06.980]  do have combat swords killing people in Iraq okay they really do have the
[3:49:06.980 --> 3:49:14.140]  Air Force is about 2012 half of its fleet is gonna be drone non man this is
[3:49:14.140 --> 3:49:18.180]  the future and I mean I we're in 2008 folks you're not in 1950 or whatever when
[3:49:18.180 --> 3:49:23.700]  you were born there are cross species human animal clones there are robots
[3:49:23.700 --> 3:49:28.380]  they're developing I've talked to Marines about classified stuff a lot of
[3:49:28.380 --> 3:49:32.820]  which was later came out they've got really vicious combat max a lot of them
[3:49:32.820 --> 3:49:37.620]  look like a small army tank it but it but it's a robot it's got its own little
[3:49:37.620 --> 3:49:41.540]  brain it's got a face scan it's got cameras one of these things was in the
[3:49:41.540 --> 3:49:45.540]  Honolulu paper a couple years ago was a mini tank and it looked like a joke it
[3:49:45.540 --> 3:49:49.460]  had like 15 guns on it or something you know cannons and machine guns and
[3:49:49.460 --> 3:49:58.140]  nerve gas sprayers and and pepper spray sprayers and I mean it's real I again I
[3:49:58.140 --> 3:50:04.060]  can't believe the public's denial about all this I mean I just can't believe the
[3:50:04.060 --> 3:50:09.180]  denial or that you don't understand what it means that they'll send out these
[3:50:09.180 --> 3:50:14.260]  robots to find you in the woods and then that'll call in drones above drop a
[3:50:14.260 --> 3:50:19.260]  nerve gas on you now our military is gearing up to attack us with nerve gas
[3:50:19.260 --> 3:50:23.540]  this is for us North come I mean that's what North come does they train to
[3:50:23.540 --> 3:50:27.060]  destroy the American people I'm gonna skip this break to take calls right now
[3:50:27.060 --> 3:50:31.300]  here we go on the web better than not getting it anybody
[3:50:31.300 --> 3:50:36.740]  trages came and asked me question what is that proof it for what I don't know
[3:50:36.740 --> 3:50:42.140]  what it is yeah but I don't even need to be in the press release I just want
[3:50:42.140 --> 3:50:47.660]  Willie and and Ventura in the press release I deliberately wrote that where
[3:50:47.660 --> 3:50:56.500]  I'm not in it huh I mean I know she's been putting all day on adding this yeah
[3:50:56.500 --> 3:51:00.380]  you know I know I don't want it in there just I don't want to put myself in
[3:51:00.380 --> 3:51:04.980]  there so many people coming in here during the brakes we're still live on
[3:51:04.980 --> 3:51:08.420]  air by the way right now that's what people coming in that it's like they
[3:51:08.420 --> 3:51:12.940]  just ran into each other like a cartoon I was in there earlier had two phones to
[3:51:12.940 --> 3:51:17.460]  my head and three people in there trying to talk to me that I said I go to calls
[3:51:17.460 --> 3:51:26.940]  Tony in Canada you're on the air Tony go ahead hey John boy hey Tony look hey
[3:51:26.940 --> 3:51:30.660]  Tony how you doing I'm pretty good thanks greetings from the great white
[3:51:30.660 --> 3:51:38.060]  north welcome yeah big fan subscriber all night nerd okay listen I wanted to
[3:51:38.060 --> 3:51:46.220]  just make a point here and I'll be quick I was attending a Nam Chomsky and I
[3:51:46.220 --> 3:51:49.580]  know you're not a big fan of his and I don't disagree with you well he talks
[3:51:49.580 --> 3:51:55.300]  like this and so he must be a genius so sorry I know I know and even you get the
[3:51:55.300 --> 3:51:59.260]  answer question and answer period people are getting up to the mic you know and
[3:51:59.260 --> 3:52:03.500]  about every person who's getting up there was saying reading your hand and
[3:52:03.500 --> 3:52:07.460]  saying well you know what can I do I'm just a single person you know an after
[3:52:07.460 --> 3:52:12.580]  about four or five of these Chomsky just lost it and he's like saying to these
[3:52:12.580 --> 3:52:16.220]  people you know if it's the people in Haiti who are one of the most oppressed
[3:52:16.220 --> 3:52:20.020]  people you can come up you know you can find can organize an overthrow of
[3:52:20.020 --> 3:52:27.500]  government he says you know what's wrong with you people well that sounds like
[3:52:27.500 --> 3:52:32.780]  you might actually be a real human being well yeah my point though Lord Chomsky
[3:52:32.780 --> 3:52:37.420]  email about this is that you know historically most revolution including
[3:52:37.420 --> 3:52:41.340]  the French Revolution it was it was the over through an entrenched bureaucracy
[3:52:41.340 --> 3:52:45.340]  with less than seven percent of the population yeah same thing with ours
[3:52:45.340 --> 3:52:50.060]  about two percent start of the war five percent won the war absolutely I mean
[3:52:50.060 --> 3:52:53.900]  what we've got is what we think we're bad and tough and cool and smart but
[3:52:53.900 --> 3:52:59.540]  really we're a domesticated lap of luxury nation of cowards and but don't
[3:52:59.540 --> 3:53:02.340]  worry getting you know getting run over and humiliated will turn you back into a
[3:53:02.340 --> 3:53:04.300]  man
[3:53:04.300 --> 3:53:07.820]  well absolutely but i'm just saying that that you know like everybody i've talked
[3:53:07.820 --> 3:53:08.660]  to you here
[3:53:08.660 --> 3:53:12.140]  and mentioning things they all know something about
[3:53:12.140 --> 3:53:15.980]  even the people that don't you know really get into uh... you know looking
[3:53:15.980 --> 3:53:18.620]  into the reality of the situation here
[3:53:18.620 --> 3:53:21.260]  and everybody knows what they're up there store food there
[3:53:21.260 --> 3:53:23.420]  there's fashion cash
[3:53:23.420 --> 3:53:25.900]  you know and it's not going to take them you guys there
[3:53:25.900 --> 3:53:28.900]  their control is there it is by a thumbnail
[3:53:28.900 --> 3:53:32.420]  no no i agree the leader in deep trouble no amount of combat robots is going to
[3:53:32.420 --> 3:53:33.180]  help them
[3:53:33.180 --> 3:53:35.980]  if we can defeat the new order the next five to ten years
[3:53:35.980 --> 3:53:38.580]  after that they're just gonna have helicopters flying pattern grids that
[3:53:38.580 --> 3:53:40.620]  are robotic nerve-gassing all of us
[3:53:40.620 --> 3:53:43.780]  but the public won't believe it till they see whole city's dying then we'll get
[3:53:43.780 --> 3:53:44.860]  the victory
[3:53:44.860 --> 3:53:47.540]  we're gonna win it just it's just how far down the line
[3:53:47.540 --> 3:53:50.020]  of the extermination operation will it be uh...
[3:53:50.020 --> 3:53:53.420]  hold on we're going back to the full audience
[3:53:53.420 --> 3:54:03.060]  song
[3:54:03.060 --> 3:54:08.060]  but your thoughts will soon be rambling the way they always do
[3:54:08.060 --> 3:54:12.060]  but your thoughts will soon be wandering
[3:54:12.060 --> 3:54:15.060]  the way they always do
[3:54:15.060 --> 3:54:18.060]  when you're riding sixteen hours
[3:54:18.060 --> 3:54:21.060]  and there's nothing much to do
[3:54:21.060 --> 3:54:24.340]  and you don't feel much like riding
[3:54:24.340 --> 3:54:28.540]  you just wish the trip was through
[3:54:28.540 --> 3:54:35.540]  it's a good song i can just play this out at the end of the show right now
[3:54:35.540 --> 3:54:39.220]  on the road again
[3:54:39.220 --> 3:54:41.540]  here i am
[3:54:41.540 --> 3:54:45.740]  upon the stage
[3:54:45.740 --> 3:54:48.660]  here i go
[3:54:48.660 --> 3:54:54.180]  playing the star again
[3:54:54.180 --> 3:54:57.380]  now you're right we actually outnumber them
[3:54:57.380 --> 3:55:00.340]  they've just somehow convinced us that we're the minority
[3:55:00.340 --> 3:55:02.420]  i think the song says it here we go
[3:55:02.420 --> 3:55:05.180]  most times you can hear them talk
[3:55:05.180 --> 3:55:22.180]  sometimes you can't want to explode
[3:55:22.180 --> 3:55:25.060]  alright finish it up tony you're making good points about how
[3:55:25.060 --> 3:55:28.180]  everybody hates the government the scumbags the filth
[3:55:28.180 --> 3:55:32.620]  you're up in canada same thing yeah their crap isn't selling anymore thank god
[3:55:32.620 --> 3:55:35.500]  well my whole point is that Alex
[3:55:35.500 --> 3:55:36.740]  people should not
[3:55:36.740 --> 3:55:40.100]  you know i mean you can listen to the news and it's hard not to get down and
[3:55:40.100 --> 3:55:41.700]  depressed
[3:55:41.700 --> 3:55:44.980]  all anxious and everything else but
[3:55:44.980 --> 3:55:47.140]  the my point is that
[3:55:47.140 --> 3:55:53.220]  uh... it's not that it's bad but you know the it's not like it's the end
[3:55:53.220 --> 3:55:55.020]  no i understand that
[3:55:55.020 --> 3:55:58.060]  we're just look we're we're not trying to even reach people that are already
[3:55:58.060 --> 3:56:01.580]  awake you know this show isn't just the choir we're on amon f m all this other
[3:56:01.580 --> 3:56:04.620]  stuff we're reaching new people every day by the tens of thousands
[3:56:04.620 --> 3:56:06.700]  and so we're trying to with the facts
[3:56:06.700 --> 3:56:09.980]  shock them out of their days people say well alex you know it's all mad and
[3:56:09.980 --> 3:56:11.300]  angry and scary
[3:56:11.300 --> 3:56:12.460]  truth is scary
[3:56:12.460 --> 3:56:15.420]  and i think that i think the hard medicine is what's needed and actually
[3:56:15.420 --> 3:56:16.500]  gets people to go
[3:56:16.500 --> 3:56:18.060]  huh now what are you saying
[3:56:18.060 --> 3:56:20.660]  instead of apologetically or nicely telling them
[3:56:20.660 --> 3:56:22.860]  i tell them look you look in this right now
[3:56:22.860 --> 3:56:25.060]  this is serious i appreciate your call

[3:56:55.300 --> 3:56:57.100]  so a lot of stuff going on
[3:56:57.100 --> 3:57:01.180]  now people are still confused by this and i don't understand why
[3:57:01.180 --> 3:57:03.100]  uh... willy on air like two
[3:57:03.100 --> 3:57:07.380]  months ago said yeah let's have a free concert for the public
[3:57:07.380 --> 3:57:09.580]  and then his schedule just wouldn't allow it
[3:57:09.580 --> 3:57:11.860]  up you know until the winter time
[3:57:11.860 --> 3:57:14.340]  and i didn't want to wait that long so he said well look
[3:57:14.340 --> 3:57:17.900]  just come to this event the last thing at the backyard before they close it
[3:57:17.900 --> 3:57:18.980]  move it
[3:57:18.980 --> 3:57:21.700]  of his venue out in the hill country boston
[3:57:21.700 --> 3:57:24.500]  and so i said okay and he said we'll stream it for free on the web for
[3:57:24.500 --> 3:57:25.220]  everybody
[3:57:25.220 --> 3:57:27.260]  so that's it it's it's it's
[3:57:27.260 --> 3:57:30.540]  we didn't do the big alex jones willy nelson
[3:57:30.540 --> 3:57:31.980]  anti-war thing
[3:57:31.980 --> 3:57:34.940]  we're doing that here with ventura and willy and myself
[3:57:34.940 --> 3:57:37.340]  and extreme free on the web
[3:57:37.340 --> 3:57:40.260]  some people confuse the event with the ticket sales and stuff this thing was
[3:57:40.260 --> 3:57:43.060]  sold out when we move this to this event
[3:57:43.060 --> 3:57:45.060]  this is just one of willy nelson's shows
[3:57:45.060 --> 3:57:46.700]  this is a historic one
[3:57:46.700 --> 3:57:48.740]  he actually founded the backyard
[3:57:48.740 --> 3:57:52.140]  so uh... good luck getting tickets sold out for weeks but some are available
[3:57:52.140 --> 3:57:53.760]  out there ridiculous prices
