[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  It's Tuesday, June 7th, 2016, we now take you to Germany with a report, stay with us.
[00:11.520 --> 00:21.560]  There was one muslim, an afghanian muslim, and he told me, at a rally, I will cut off
[00:21.560 --> 00:27.560]  your head.
[00:27.560 --> 00:32.240]  Rob Dew reporting for infowars.com, we are in Munich, Germany, we just landed and we
[00:32.240 --> 00:38.000]  are at the train station here in downtown Munich, about a 15 minute drive from the airport
[00:38.000 --> 00:41.280]  and as you can see it's a hustle and bustle, lots of people coming around here.
[00:41.280 --> 00:46.080]  What are we here for mainly, to talk about the migrant crisis that is going on in Europe
[00:46.080 --> 00:48.720]  and how it can spill over to the United States.
[00:48.720 --> 00:53.080]  Last year there were about 1 million migrants coming into Germany, where we're at in Bavaria
[00:53.080 --> 00:57.320]  had the second most highest concentration of migrants and they have them in areas all
[00:57.320 --> 00:58.320]  around here.
[00:58.320 --> 01:01.600]  Right now there's not a high concentration in the train station and so far this year
[01:01.600 --> 01:05.560]  with the closing of the borders, there's only been about 200,000 entering in.
[01:05.560 --> 01:10.400]  But now here's my friend Michael Stutzenberger, he is with the German Freedom Party and so
[01:10.400 --> 01:13.880]  we're going to do a little interview, I talked with him on email and he agreed to meet with
[01:13.880 --> 01:14.880]  us.
[01:14.880 --> 01:18.640]  So tell us about your German Freedom Party, what are you guys all about?
[01:18.640 --> 01:26.960]  So we are informing the people about Islam, about the danger of Islam and we want to have
[01:26.960 --> 01:34.760]  direct democracy, we wanted the people vote for very important decisions and yeah we are
[01:34.760 --> 01:44.560]  very aware of that refugee problem because you told it was more than 1 million people
[01:44.560 --> 01:51.080]  coming last year, this year over 200,000 and this is a big problem for Germany.
[01:51.080 --> 01:55.040]  And so what kind of strain does that put on your infrastructure in terms of crime, in
[01:55.040 --> 02:01.520]  terms of extra police presence, in terms of them basically feeding off the system?
[02:01.520 --> 02:08.960]  You know we have a lot of people from North and Africa and there are many of them who
[02:08.960 --> 02:20.720]  make criminality, there's rape problem, there's stealing and yeah people start to feel unsecure
[02:20.720 --> 02:29.600]  in their own country, women fear, little girls fear when they go to school.
[02:29.600 --> 02:35.880]  Many of the refugees are Muslims, they are coming from a totally different culture where
[02:35.880 --> 02:42.360]  women are on a lower level and raping is something normal for them, so it's a very difficult
[02:42.360 --> 02:43.360]  situation.
[02:43.360 --> 02:50.920]  And how many would you estimate are men say 18 to 50 that are coming in to your country?
[02:50.920 --> 02:59.160]  So there are a lot of young men coming, there are between 18 and 25, most of them, most
[02:59.160 --> 03:07.760]  of them Muslims, not so many women, not so many children and most of them have no right
[03:07.760 --> 03:15.920]  for asylum, they are refugees into our social system, they want to have a better life and
[03:15.920 --> 03:24.320]  our politicians say oh, all welcome, they want to be good Germans, welcome to everybody
[03:24.320 --> 03:26.520]  and it's not so good.
[03:26.520 --> 03:30.800]  So I was reading on the internet about a project you were working on, basically Saudi Arabia
[03:30.800 --> 03:35.320]  wanted to fund one of the largest mosques here in Munich and tell us about your efforts
[03:35.320 --> 03:36.640]  to fight that.
[03:36.640 --> 03:45.540]  So we collected signatures for 3 years, we had 65,000 people who subscribed but the city
[03:45.540 --> 03:52.160]  of Munich, the politicians, don't want that referendum so they put us to court to fight
[03:52.160 --> 03:57.560]  against that referendum so we have to fight for the right of the people to decide.
[03:57.560 --> 03:58.880]  It's so crazy.
[03:58.880 --> 04:08.080]  Now we had to start a new referendum and we want definitely to stop this project because
[04:08.080 --> 04:15.320]  somebody from Saudi Arabia financing this huge mosque would be a big problem because
[04:15.320 --> 04:24.280]  Saudi Arabia is putting millions and millions of dollars in building mosques all over Europe
[04:24.280 --> 04:31.640]  in Bosnia and Germany and everywhere, they want to Islamise Europe and they are financing
[04:31.640 --> 04:38.480]  terror, they are financing al-Qaeda, they are financing Islamic State so it's so crazy
[04:38.480 --> 04:43.400]  what's going on there, we have to stop it but the politicians close their eyes because
[04:43.400 --> 04:49.520]  the money from the Arabic world is very important for Munich, they are coming rich Arabians
[04:49.520 --> 04:56.640]  here in the hospitals and they are buying here in the luxury shops millions of euros
[04:56.640 --> 05:02.040]  for the city so they let all of them in.
[05:02.040 --> 05:07.640]  Hillary Clinton has no shortage of celebrity endorsements including actress Eva Longoria,
[05:07.640 --> 05:10.560]  Snoop D.O.G. and Kim Kardashian.
[05:10.560 --> 05:16.040]  Now she's gaining support from an unlikely source for a very bizarre reason, Scott Adams.
[05:16.040 --> 05:20.600]  The creator of the long-lived comic strip series Dilbert is endorsing Hillary out of
[05:20.600 --> 05:22.920]  fear for his personal safety.
[05:22.920 --> 05:27.920]  Despite never having endorsed Donald Trump, Adams says he's already been on the receiving
[05:27.920 --> 05:32.880]  end of criticism from Hillary supporters labelling him a Trump apologist, Engels of
[05:32.880 --> 05:36.520]  Goebbels, the head of Hitler's Ministry of Propaganda.
[05:36.520 --> 05:41.520]  Adams posted this on his blog, Trump took her so-called woman card and turned it into
[05:41.520 --> 05:42.520]  a liability.
[05:42.520 --> 05:48.520]  So Clinton wisely pivoted, her new scare tactics are solid gold persuasion, I wouldn't be surprised
[05:48.520 --> 05:53.480]  if you see Clinton's numbers versus Trump improve in June at least temporarily until
[05:53.480 --> 05:55.520]  Trump finds a counter move.

[08:13.320 --> 08:28.400]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:28.400 --> 08:31.080]  Our reporters are in Germany.
[08:31.080 --> 08:41.360]  Rom-Doo, Josh Owens, they're going to be joining us coming up today at 12.30 Central Standard
[08:41.360 --> 08:42.360]  Time.
[08:42.360 --> 08:44.240]  Now, that's over in Europe.
[08:44.240 --> 08:50.360]  Now, on the West Coast, Leanne McAdoo, Joe Beggs and others will be joining us from
[08:50.360 --> 08:51.360]  California.
[08:51.360 --> 08:56.520]  And of course, they've got those big primaries taking place today.
[08:56.520 --> 09:00.840]  And they're saying that Hillary Clinton has cinched the nomination even though she's stolen
[09:00.840 --> 09:02.160]  delegates from Bernie Sanders.
[09:02.160 --> 09:04.480]  He is not capitulating, says he's going to fight.
[09:04.480 --> 09:09.960]  But the mainstream media is saying that she is now the presumptive nominee and that Donald
[09:09.960 --> 09:12.880]  Trump has it 100%.
[09:12.880 --> 09:18.560]  I don't think it's over until the fat lady sings or until the war criminal sings because
[09:18.560 --> 09:23.040]  anything is possible with the technocrats that are in control of our nation right now.
[09:23.040 --> 09:28.400]  But we're going to be talking to Leanne McAdoo, Joe Beggs and others coming up on the West
[09:28.400 --> 09:29.880]  Coast.
[09:29.880 --> 09:34.480]  And of course, Rob Do and others with live video feeds as well from Germany.
[09:34.480 --> 09:35.800]  This is mainly a radio show.
[09:35.800 --> 09:37.840]  It started out 21 years ago as a radio show.
[09:37.840 --> 09:40.920]  But I'd also been doing television for 21 years.
[09:40.920 --> 09:44.000]  And so in about the last 16, 17 years, I merged the two.
[09:44.000 --> 09:49.000]  And this is what we call Info Wars Live with yours truly, Alex Jones, if you're just driving
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.680]  along in your car and here it's talking about video feeds and things like that.
[09:52.680 --> 09:58.280]  You can always go to infowars.com forward slash show or just go to infowars.com and
[09:58.280 --> 10:05.360]  click on the show tab, radio show tab and it actually has all of the video feeds as
[10:05.360 --> 10:06.360]  well.
[10:06.360 --> 10:11.520]  It's also going to be radio slash TV tab because that confuses some folks.
[10:11.520 --> 10:17.400]  But that's up there on infowars.com and it's a great link obviously to send out to everyone
[10:17.400 --> 10:21.000]  you know on a routine basis because they are trying to shut down free speech and destroy
[10:21.000 --> 10:29.680]  nationalism, the family and in any form of possible resistance to the technocracy.
[10:29.680 --> 10:33.560]  Let me do my best here and just go over some of these headlines.
[10:33.560 --> 10:38.040]  Dr. Bill Warner of politicalislam.com will be joining us.
[10:38.040 --> 10:40.600]  He's been highly requested by listeners the last few years.
[10:40.600 --> 10:47.720]  I finally sat down and read one of his books a few months ago and watched some of his videos.
[10:47.720 --> 10:48.720]  He's well spoken.
[10:48.720 --> 10:52.800]  He gives you a good historical breakdown, but I've read so many mainline history books.
[10:52.800 --> 10:57.200]  What he's saying is just admitted fact if you're informed.
[10:57.200 --> 11:00.640]  So he kind of goes slowly through it all.
[11:00.640 --> 11:04.320]  This will be his first visit with us for 30 minutes or so, I'm going to say listen you
[11:04.320 --> 11:07.960]  know you're an expert on this, but I've already researched what you're saying before I knew
[11:07.960 --> 11:08.960]  you.
[11:08.960 --> 11:11.560]  I know what you're saying is just mainline historical fact.
[11:11.560 --> 11:17.360]  Give us the boil down and then the timeline of where this is going.
[11:17.360 --> 11:22.040]  So we're not going to have two, three hours to go over this with him, but he is a popular
[11:22.040 --> 11:26.320]  speaker that breaks all of this down so he will be joining us.
[11:26.320 --> 11:32.040]  But I have to remember that even with informed groups out there, when you really learn about
[11:32.040 --> 11:39.600]  the history of Islam from its own writings and what the goal is, it's shocking that Western
[11:39.600 --> 11:45.960]  governments would be trying to bring in unsustainable groups of people from the most radical areas
[11:45.960 --> 11:49.280]  and then having everyone bow to their will.
[11:49.280 --> 11:56.520]  It really shows you how inherently wicked and anti-freedom based the Western controllers
[11:56.520 --> 11:58.160]  are.
[11:58.160 --> 12:02.520]  But again after they've brought in radical Islam and funded radical Islam to take over
[12:02.520 --> 12:08.840]  much of the areas already controlled by Muslims, once that radicalization process is accelerated
[12:08.840 --> 12:14.200]  into La La Land, there will be a clash of civilizations that will be expanded between
[12:14.200 --> 12:19.880]  the West per the PNAC plan, this is official plan by the globalist, and most of those
[12:19.880 --> 12:24.240]  countries will be basically turned into glass parking lots.
[12:24.240 --> 12:27.360]  So everyone's being set up right now, being played off against each other.
[12:27.360 --> 12:31.880]  I'm not against Muslims, I'm not against Arabs, I'm not against Indonesians, I'm not against
[12:31.880 --> 12:38.680]  Mongolian Muslims, but here's the deal, if you come here, we're not going to conform
[12:38.680 --> 12:42.960]  to your religious beliefs and ideas.
[12:42.960 --> 12:49.120]  We're not going to lose our freedoms of the Renaissance, hard fought the Enlightenment
[12:49.120 --> 12:51.720]  because you want us to bow to your will.
[12:51.720 --> 12:55.760]  And that goes the same for pedophile run Hollywood, that wants to teach five-year-olds
[12:55.760 --> 13:01.160]  how to have anal sex in the public schools and that wants to arrest California schoolgirls
[13:01.160 --> 13:07.440]  that talk about the Bible at lunch, SWAT teams are being deployed, I have the articles.
[13:07.440 --> 13:12.960]  So you've got the sick weird left in such a fetish to butcher the West that they'll
[13:12.960 --> 13:22.680]  ally with one of the most caveman, oppressive, monotheistic, chauvinistic, crazy town systems
[13:22.680 --> 13:26.600]  because it just creates such a melee and they want to blow it all up, they want to bring
[13:26.600 --> 13:31.760]  it down because they can't compete with free market, even though we're limited free market,
[13:31.760 --> 13:39.360]  a crony capitalist system, what's left of it is so powerful, it has an engine of choice
[13:39.360 --> 13:44.600]  in what you buy and what you sell and what you produce that they fear its revolutionary
[13:44.600 --> 13:49.200]  power and want to fully extinct it.
[13:49.200 --> 13:53.920]  That's why for a normal person, you say this doesn't make any sense, they're promoting
[13:53.920 --> 13:58.160]  people being lazy, they're promoting people being stupid, they're promoting every form
[13:58.160 --> 14:06.160]  of racism and classism and sexism while at the same time saying that they're trying to
[14:06.160 --> 14:17.440]  stop it and it's because they are social engineers that exempt themselves from the very programs
[14:17.440 --> 14:19.920]  they put us under.
[14:19.920 --> 14:26.640]  Now it was last Friday that I finally started paying attention because a lot of times I'm
[14:26.640 --> 14:33.240]  ahead of the curve on big news items, but sometimes when I see a whole bunch of different
[14:33.240 --> 14:38.320]  attacks being beta tested against gun groups or Christian groups or veterans groups or nationalist
[14:38.320 --> 14:44.440]  organizations or medical freedom groups, whatever the case may be, anytime I'm seeing an attack
[14:44.440 --> 14:51.120]  on that, there's so many of them, I'll kind of watch it grow before I comment.
[14:51.120 --> 14:55.080]  And for a week I've been hearing about Trump University and how it's the most evil thing
[14:55.080 --> 15:00.320]  on the planet and so horrible and I've been hearing about that for months but it accelerated
[15:00.320 --> 15:05.000]  and then Trump came out and said this judge is being very political, he works with very
[15:05.000 --> 15:15.360]  political groups that are basically pro-Mexico and so he is loyal to Mexico.
[15:15.360 --> 15:22.520]  But Trump just said he's a Mexican, he's not for America and allowed them to spin it that
[15:22.520 --> 15:27.120]  he was saying because he's a Mexican he can't be a judge and that's not what Trump was really
[15:27.120 --> 15:32.280]  saying and in fact in a larger clip he clarified it in his statement.
[15:32.280 --> 15:36.080]  But again, they know that they're dealing with a population in this country especially
[15:36.080 --> 15:40.040]  on the West Coast, I don't care what color they are, they cannot find their butts with
[15:40.040 --> 15:41.040]  both hands.
[15:41.040 --> 15:45.200]  I mean you've seen our videos, you've seen the other reporter videos, you've seen Mark
[15:45.200 --> 15:49.800]  Dice, I mean these are unedited, we're showing you everyone we're talking to and I don't
[15:49.800 --> 15:53.840]  care whether they're an old white man or a young black man or a young Hispanic woman,
[15:53.840 --> 16:00.160]  these people do not know what planet they're on and then all they hear is yeah Trump said
[16:00.160 --> 16:05.480]  this judge can't rule because he's a Mexican, no Trump said no, he's fine, he's loyal to
[16:05.480 --> 16:09.240]  the Mexicans and not to this country.
[16:09.240 --> 16:10.920]  People said he's a federal judge, what do you mean?
[16:10.920 --> 16:14.920]  Well most federal judges in my view aren't loyal to this country, look at their rulings
[16:14.920 --> 16:18.960]  throwing out the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[16:18.960 --> 16:22.640]  So Trump's good at dumbing things down but sometimes he dumps it down too much and the
[16:22.640 --> 16:27.600]  nuances get lost but listen, the Daily Caller first reported on this, WorldNet Daily has
[16:27.600 --> 16:33.680]  dug into it so have we and there's 13,000 different articles out there I saw on this
[16:33.680 --> 16:38.760]  today when I did a Google search, 1300 of them strangely enough have comments from yours
[16:38.760 --> 16:44.800]  truly in there so at least we're counter striking now with the facts and here's the headline
[16:44.800 --> 16:52.400]  judge, law firm bringing Trump, UK's so both the judge and the law firm bringing the Trump
[16:52.400 --> 16:58.240]  University case both tied to La Raza and I love the spin in a bunch of different newspapers
[16:58.240 --> 17:06.320]  they go well he's on a judicial La Raza board that gets scholarships for illegal aliens
[17:06.320 --> 17:12.040]  or undocumented, let me use the proper words since the government told me to and he is
[17:12.040 --> 17:16.520]  involved in the same group that Sotomayor is and actually have a New York Times quote
[17:16.520 --> 17:24.000]  here where Sotomayor in 1999 they were talking about her being a potential Supreme Court
[17:24.000 --> 17:35.960]  justice if Obama got elected and I've got the article it's 2000 something and she actually
[17:35.960 --> 17:42.480]  says in the article well I'm a Hispanic woman with particular wisdom and so I'll be able
[17:42.480 --> 17:49.280]  to rule better on cases because I'm not a white man now imagine if a white judge talks
[17:49.280 --> 17:55.680]  like that it's just crazy it's absolutely crazy and here's what I'm getting at if you're
[17:55.680 --> 18:10.160]  any other shade other than white eggshell then you are allowed to engage in classical
[18:10.160 --> 18:15.480]  racial organizations you're allowed to have BET can you imagine white entertainment television
[18:15.480 --> 18:19.880]  and I get it blacks have been downtrodden had problems and foist it out to the edge
[18:19.880 --> 18:23.880]  of society and all the rest of it so you know let folks have their own channel I actually
[18:23.880 --> 18:28.920]  get that culturally but there's been this extreme now where whites can't have any culture
[18:28.920 --> 18:35.280]  of any type I've even see articles saying are Oktoberfest racist I mean they have those
[18:35.280 --> 18:40.760]  articles every year should we get rid of Oktoberfest because it's too white you go to an Oktoberfest
[18:40.760 --> 18:45.120]  there's people every color out there having a great time eating sausages and drinking
[18:45.120 --> 18:51.240]  beer and eating pretzels but but that's what it's come down to where if you're white or
[18:51.240 --> 18:54.520]  you're Christian because that's where this is really going after his western civilization
[18:54.520 --> 18:58.160]  and the real Christian ethic not the mega church ethic but the real Christian ethic where
[18:58.160 --> 19:08.280]  I see articles every day where you will have a Christian with a Bible at a college or at
[19:08.280 --> 19:14.720]  a public school or giving out Christmas cards that happens every year all over the country
[19:14.720 --> 19:19.840]  and they get called in and they get suspended or expelled or the police come because they
[19:19.840 --> 19:22.680]  talked about Bible verses.
[19:22.680 --> 19:26.520]  Kelly McBrain wrote an article about this school called sheriff on seven year old for
[19:26.520 --> 19:31.640]  sharing Bible verses California elementary school sent deputies to boys home for distributing
[19:31.640 --> 19:36.480]  Christian materials well you should be allowed to hand out birthday cards or Valentine's
[19:36.480 --> 19:41.920]  cards or cards I mean they teach Islam in the schools for quote diversity but see Christianity
[19:41.920 --> 19:48.360]  is prosada nangrada remember the Pope said three weeks ago in La Croix newspaper he goes
[19:48.360 --> 19:53.720]  I just abhor I just can't stand hearing about Christian roots in Europe we need to stop this
[19:53.720 --> 20:01.520]  this is xenophobic this is colonialism and see it is an attack on the West period.

[24:35.120 --> 24:44.480]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com bottom line I want prosperity I want wealth I want
[24:44.480 --> 24:50.760]  freedom of choice I want the family and the human institution honored and protected and
[24:50.760 --> 24:56.000]  I want to see our environment the genetic registry of this planet protected I don't
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.680]  want to see thousands of major corporations genetically splicing every species under the
[25:00.680 --> 25:09.840]  sun in mass creating huge mutations across the genetic spectrum from plankton to whales
[25:09.840 --> 25:16.440]  from humans down to fire ants we are all being manipulated and changed and the globalists
[25:16.440 --> 25:27.440]  are acting like the island of dr. morrow on pcp and I tune into television and it is
[25:27.440 --> 25:34.560]  the most weaponized garbage including fox news remember the whole lacrosse team thing
[25:34.560 --> 25:40.320]  years ago that went on for three years where the white lacrosse team raped the black stripper
[25:40.320 --> 25:48.520]  it was all made up it was all lies but it was sold to create racial division and also
[25:48.520 --> 25:55.000]  create the illusion that all sexes rape the hardcore third wave feminist view and they've
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.520]  got all these movies out you know like the neighbors to where oh the next the frat house
[26:00.520 --> 26:05.400]  and the whole thing is about how men wanting to have sex with women is rape period and
[26:05.400 --> 26:10.640]  men are inherently bad I mean it's all just weaponized to turn everybody into gibbering
[26:10.640 --> 26:16.040]  idiots I'll be talking about that coming up in the next segment you know this stanford
[26:16.040 --> 26:21.440]  swimmer champion only got six months because at a at a party they caught him with a girl
[26:21.440 --> 26:28.120]  that was drunk and looked like she was passed out this guy looks like an entitled creep
[26:28.120 --> 26:31.960]  to me quite frankly because there's nothing worse than these guys haven't done anything
[26:31.960 --> 26:35.320]  with their lives that go around thinking they're you know elitist and all the rest of it and
[26:35.320 --> 26:39.240]  he kind of fits that bill and I don't like frat parties I don't like the whole thing
[26:39.240 --> 26:45.240]  but I'll tell you something right now statistically they release thousands of illegal aliens every
[26:45.240 --> 26:51.720]  year for hardcore rape and don't even charge them or they're convicted and they just release
[26:51.720 --> 26:59.560]  them but that's okay but see it's not a big cause celeb every time the illegal alien whether
[26:59.560 --> 27:07.040]  they be Chinese or Mexican or Eastern European or whatever but boy let me tell you when there's
[27:07.040 --> 27:16.480]  some swim team champ and the two white knights catching I'm gonna cover this more later all
[27:16.480 --> 27:23.320]  the details you know catch him with a drunk woman and they tackle him and call the police
[27:23.320 --> 27:29.920]  and then the judge and the police and the probation officer and everybody this guy had
[27:29.920 --> 27:35.520]  no criminal record previous but the officer already signed in case he goes on probation
[27:35.520 --> 27:42.320]  says you know what you need to really just give this guy time served for six months and
[27:42.320 --> 27:45.920]  I'll just tell you there is rape that goes on on campus there are people to get roofing
[27:45.920 --> 27:57.240]  it is a problem but I personally in high school and going to college parties I don't like
[27:57.240 --> 28:03.560]  it back when I was more promiscuous I might say that's a good thing I'm just being honest
[28:03.560 --> 28:07.280]  I ran to this thing where women would call you into a room and then lay down and act
[28:07.280 --> 28:12.120]  like they were passed out so I guess somehow they didn't have to feel guilty that they
[28:12.120 --> 28:17.600]  were having sex and I just was like hey I'm not having sex with a sack of potatoes get
[28:17.600 --> 28:23.680]  up and they go okay oh and then I mean it I was like just forget it you're a screwball
[28:23.680 --> 28:30.760]  I ran into that I don't want to exaggerate hmm I was promiscuous I'm not proud of it
[28:30.760 --> 28:42.040]  but didn't have any problem with the ladies I don't know I ran into this women playing
[28:42.040 --> 28:49.760]  possum probably 30-40 times and I learned it was just something that they did so it
[28:49.760 --> 28:54.680]  was like a denial that they'd done something bad some type of weird the new thing is women
[28:54.680 --> 28:57.680]  say and I don't want to get graphic if kids are listening to now but this is scientific
[28:57.680 --> 29:03.160]  fact this is in the news young women will tell people oh I just have anal sex I'm waiting
[29:03.160 --> 29:08.440]  for marriage for the other as birth control and the big joke is that's what Catholic girls
[29:08.440 --> 29:17.040]  do and then the other thing is oral sex there are there's news articles about this the CDC
[29:17.040 --> 29:22.000]  is concerned about it as well where a young say 16 17 year old girl has given oral sex
[29:22.000 --> 29:28.440]  to maybe 50 a hundred boys young men at the school but it's okay because it's oral so
[29:28.440 --> 29:33.400]  again it's one of those games and then there's all this feminist thing hate the man all sex
[29:33.400 --> 29:37.280]  is rape you know if you don't give them a contract you know they can't have sex with
[29:37.280 --> 29:41.920]  you or if you wake up because you were drunk and now didn't want to do it say it's rape
[29:41.920 --> 29:47.440]  I mean the courts know there is a jihad against men even the courts know the police know that
[29:47.440 --> 29:53.640]  about half the rape case claims they get are fake we're on the March the empires on the
[29:53.640 --> 30:05.480]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network three years after the IRS admitted officials singled
[30:05.480 --> 30:10.880]  out conservative groups for extra scrutiny the tax collecting agency has released a near
[30:10.880 --> 30:16.040]  complete list of the organization's targeted and it numbers in the hundreds for the first
[30:16.040 --> 30:22.160]  time showing the extent to which the agency slow walked application for tax exam status
[30:22.160 --> 30:28.960]  reports Fox News the new list shows a total of 426 organizations far higher than what
[30:28.960 --> 30:34.080]  the Treasury Department's Inspector General believed there to be back in May 2013 when
[30:34.080 --> 30:39.720]  he identified nearly 300 groups the names ban the gamut covering well-known groups like
[30:39.720 --> 30:45.640]  the Tea Party Patriots but also lower profile locals like the Louisiana campaign for Liberty
[30:45.640 --> 30:51.400]  Patriots of Charleston the Asheville Tea Party Incorporated and many more a federal judge

[34:12.520 --> 34:19.000]  i would hope that as a wise latin woman with the richness of her experiences would more
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.000]  often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life said
[34:24.000 --> 34:29.160]  to me or who is now considered to be near the top of president obama's list of potential
[34:29.160 --> 34:33.200]  supreme court nominees hey i think it'd be great to have a hispanic woman on the supreme
[34:33.200 --> 34:44.400]  court but let me tell you something about so to me or and kagan these penguin like women
[34:44.400 --> 34:57.120]  are anti-gun anti-republic anti-free market globalist slimes and i am sick and tired of
[34:57.120 --> 35:04.360]  the media and the system and the culture look growing up in dallas texas i experienced
[35:04.360 --> 35:11.400]  territorial ganglike activity from white people and from black people about equally
[35:11.400 --> 35:18.040]  and it was bad any excuse to fight each other blacks were to fight blacks blacks were to
[35:18.040 --> 35:22.040]  fight whites vice versa rednecks would just pull up if they didn't know you start a fight
[35:22.040 --> 35:27.960]  with you it was horrible most cities aren't like that i had no idea till i moved to austin
[35:27.960 --> 35:32.240]  that most places weren't completely insane and it was super male super macho hey i kind
[35:32.240 --> 35:37.120]  of like the whole liberal side of let's not beat each other's brains out and i'll say
[35:37.120 --> 35:43.240]  it i didn't run into a lot of trouble with mexicans and racial stuff though five of them
[35:43.240 --> 35:48.280]  were there four of them broke my leg once so i've only only had mexicans attacked me
[35:48.280 --> 35:52.560]  because of racially pretty much you know once it was not like the rednecks because they
[35:52.560 --> 35:58.240]  didn't know me or the blacks you know constantly uh but uh i was talking to a guy last night
[35:58.240 --> 36:03.280]  from houston he was hispanic and white which is kind of an oxymoron hispanics are native
[36:03.280 --> 36:08.400]  american and white and that's what it is uh but it gets the name from hispan yola which
[36:08.400 --> 36:14.080]  is the venican republic to the east and heady to the west but again the public doesn't have
[36:14.080 --> 36:19.080]  any of this information it's just crazy i could argue i'm hispanic because i'm 13% native american
[36:19.080 --> 36:24.040]  it's just ridiculous all it means is i can get a better tan i don't care i'm proud of
[36:24.040 --> 36:30.280]  my heritage it's just such mental illness that i can't handle it anymore and the way
[36:30.280 --> 36:35.160]  they push race-based garbage and the way they're doing it with hispanic groups in the media
[36:35.160 --> 36:41.280]  and the universities is is a travesty and it's because they've already handicapped latin america
[36:41.280 --> 36:46.040]  with communism is the supposed way to get out of crony capitalism well latin america
[36:46.040 --> 36:52.120]  is probably on average about 90% look it up yourself less wealthy than it was 60 years
[36:52.120 --> 36:56.320]  ago thanks to getting into socialism and communism how's it working out for you down
[36:56.320 --> 37:02.240]  in venezuela right now the new world order doesn't want latin americans who are smart
[37:02.240 --> 37:07.800]  super hardworking and family-based to ever get their own economic system going because
[37:07.800 --> 37:14.960]  it will be independent it will be vibrant it will be amazing and it will be explosive
[37:14.960 --> 37:19.560]  so instead that's why you've got all the free tuition for latin americans to come here and
[37:19.560 --> 37:24.960]  become the new ruling class of communists that are funded by big megabanks and that's
[37:24.960 --> 37:30.240]  all it is and that's what this judge in the trump case is and it's been documented and
[37:30.240 --> 37:40.120]  proven that a la raza law firm and a low and and the la raza group and this judge all there
[37:40.120 --> 37:46.360]  are hardcore mexican nationalist larica conquista pushers but that's only on the surface the
[37:46.360 --> 37:50.800]  ford foundation cooked this thing up in the 50s it's liberation theology out of the central
[37:50.800 --> 37:57.560]  intelligence agency it's all declassified this is not my opinion this guy works for
[37:57.560 --> 38:04.760]  the new world order and he's propped in there to stop some orange-haired nationalist popping
[38:04.760 --> 38:10.320]  up pointing out that this guy's pro mexican he doesn't mean mexicans that are in the us
[38:10.320 --> 38:14.520]  that's like saying you know no it'd be like if this guy worked for germany but was a federal
[38:14.520 --> 38:18.080]  judge and he said this guy's a german and he's ruling against me because i'm against
[38:18.080 --> 38:23.680]  merkle but see that dog wouldn't hunt because it's white guys against white guys but because
[38:23.680 --> 38:31.680]  they could say oh it's this spanish hispanic guy now it's all this racism because the media
[38:31.680 --> 38:35.920]  knows that the general public doesn't understand la raza and match it and all this stuff which
[38:35.920 --> 38:38.840]  goes out there and says we're going to empower the people we're going to build everybody
[38:38.840 --> 38:43.320]  up here here's how you do it working with the system working with the government getting
[38:43.320 --> 38:47.400]  into the government you know don't go out and build your own business don't go out and
[38:47.400 --> 38:50.960]  build your own system don't no no no just stay right here with us and we're going to
[38:50.960 --> 38:58.400]  take care of you we're going to take real good care of you even la raza whites were
[38:58.400 --> 39:01.880]  on that plantation to a certain extent until the republicans and others in the south went
[39:01.880 --> 39:06.120]  against that in the fifties and sixties so the democrats had to flip from racial politics
[39:06.120 --> 39:09.640]  on one end to the other but look i gotta get to other news i gotta get to boulderberg but
[39:09.640 --> 39:16.440]  it's all interconnected but let me just run through these headlines judge law firm so the
[39:16.440 --> 39:21.400]  judge and the law firm bringing trump uk's both tied to la raza well not tied to it they're
[39:21.400 --> 39:27.960]  like senior people over it here's another one new york times again i mentioned it was
[39:27.960 --> 39:36.120]  put to me here and her racist statements let's can or just arrogant statements now let's look
[39:36.120 --> 39:41.120]  at all these other headlines that tie together with this isis publicly burns alive nineteen
[39:41.120 --> 39:47.200]  kurdish women for rejecting sex slavery report man i wish we could hear about the six hundred
[39:47.200 --> 39:53.040]  million women under dominant radical islam worldwide who can't drive cars and who can't
[39:53.040 --> 39:57.440]  go outside without a male attendant and have to wear full hoods over their heads boy i wish
[39:57.440 --> 40:01.880]  i was hearing about that in our mainstream media but up here from the russian news rt
[40:01.880 --> 40:08.880]  they videotaped it they were punished for refusing to have sex with isis militants and that's
[40:08.880 --> 40:14.160]  muslim women this is how these dogs these pigs behave these these these pig turds i'm sorry
[40:14.160 --> 40:19.680]  this is what isis is the instrument of a pig now i'm not going to be hearing about that in our
[40:19.680 --> 40:26.560]  media i'm gonna hear about dad judge under fire after x stanford swimmer sentenced for sex assault
[40:26.560 --> 40:31.680]  do you know what the average sentence you can look this up per state it varies
[40:32.560 --> 40:36.800]  for a this type of assault where it's not aggravated where they weren't tied up they
[40:36.800 --> 40:42.160]  weren't beaten up it's probation ladies and gentlemen now you can say let's up these sentences
[40:42.160 --> 40:48.240]  but the but he was recommended a normal six month sentence but because he's some trendy white guy who
[40:48.240 --> 40:53.040]  does look like a psycho in the photos maybe he's not and and and he's in the it's a frat party
[40:53.040 --> 40:59.520]  why they two guys caught him on top of girl who was almost passed out okay whatever maybe he did
[40:59.520 --> 41:05.360]  rape her the point is who what are parents doing paying to send their daughters to these colleges
[41:05.360 --> 41:11.200]  to then send them into these arrested development frat houses where 22 year old guys rule over a
[41:11.200 --> 41:16.080]  bunch of dumb guys and then women come in everybody acts like morons now that's when
[41:16.080 --> 41:19.680]  he's not got out of college he's going to some of these frat parties and stuff i was like this is
[41:19.680 --> 41:26.960]  horrible it's like high school part two i'm out of here i'm gonna go date a hot 30 year old see you
[41:26.960 --> 41:34.240]  later now sorry 22 year old women were like when i was 20 we're like too young i'm always looking
[41:34.240 --> 41:40.560]  going for the full deal what's the what's the absolute i guess because i'm 42 the most beautiful
[41:40.560 --> 41:47.200]  woman i've seen but it's about 35 to 40 i want the full deal i want the overwhelming woman
[41:48.320 --> 41:51.600]  but i get a little arrested development guys and the girls don't want to get in trouble in case
[41:51.600 --> 41:56.160]  something happens so they drink and then lay there and then where you going come back you know i'm
[41:56.160 --> 42:02.000]  i'm drunk you have sex with me you know it's just it's just total bull and this may have happened
[42:02.000 --> 42:07.120]  in this case but the judge and even the police said no he needs to have suspended sentence or six
[42:07.120 --> 42:12.400]  months meanwhile tens of thousands of illegals it depends on the year sometimes it's 50 something
[42:12.400 --> 42:20.800]  thousand are released for rape robbery aggravated assault arson i mean you see it in the news and
[42:20.800 --> 42:30.000]  so my issue is listen burn this guy i tell you what giving 50 years in prison okay and release all
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.960]  the nonviolent people okay okay 50 years let's give it to him but let's give the illegals 50 years
[42:34.960 --> 42:39.440]  it's not that i hate the illegals it's that i hate the fact that nobody knows who they are
[42:39.440 --> 42:45.120]  they're just running around from china and mexico and everywhere else and they're just completely
[42:45.120 --> 42:50.480]  left alone to do whatever they want but if you go along with the system and you pay your taxes as a
[42:51.680 --> 42:56.240]  american of any race color recruit i don't like to hyphenate let's say mexican american
[42:56.240 --> 43:02.240]  anglo-american african-american if you go along with everything they throw the freaking book at you
[43:03.440 --> 43:10.080]  and then this guy gets a standard sentence and they're on fox news acting like it's the end of
[43:10.080 --> 43:16.800]  the world they're making oh my god it's so hard oh why does this recall the judge is so horrible
[43:16.800 --> 43:22.160]  i mean you know how many illegal aliens get let go two three four times until they kill somebody
[43:22.160 --> 43:28.160]  in a drunk driving accident i see those articles every week texas tennessee california and you
[43:28.160 --> 43:34.480]  know what it's usually a mini van full of six or seven americans who happen to be hispanic
[43:34.480 --> 43:40.640]  getting killed by another drunk illegal alien and that's another thing i get it's the culture down
[43:40.640 --> 43:44.400]  in mexico to drive drunk used to be our culture here if we're going to really crack down on it
[43:44.400 --> 43:50.640]  you got to crack down on everybody you can't let illegals go for drunk driving but then throw the
[43:50.640 --> 43:56.640]  book at a guy who's got the last name sanchez because his family's been here for 150 years and
[43:56.640 --> 44:06.160]  he's an american or jones or johnson i mean it is just it's like oh they didn't mean it so it's i mean
[44:06.160 --> 44:12.800]  you know how i have been rear-ended by illegals three times most of car wrecks i've had since i
[44:12.800 --> 44:16.640]  got out of high school i was never a driver then i had some bad i had some wrecks then and hardly
[44:16.640 --> 44:21.920]  any after them it's what tornado blew me off the road once and illegals ran into me three times at

[47:32.160 --> 47:38.320]  african season a surge of attacks on albinos who were taken by crowds and eaten but i'm sure
[47:38.320 --> 47:46.400]  that's white people's fault obama sees global commitments for one million more refugees in
[47:46.400 --> 47:53.680]  schools and one million more legally working yes video protesters with we need socialism signs
[47:53.680 --> 47:58.560]  visually attack pro trump hispanics oh yeah they're really trying to intimidate this is
[47:58.560 --> 48:05.360]  racketeering hispanics that are out there going to the uh trump rallies and by the way
[48:05.360 --> 48:08.960]  then we're going to dr gripper in a moment i'm gonna skip a sprague
[48:12.160 --> 48:18.960]  by the way trump does this baby talk thing he does where he goes i have one here i have the
[48:18.960 --> 48:23.120]  head of the veterans group or i have one here i have one of the delegates here they were told

[48:35.360 --> 48:40.880]  what are you gonna do get them some fried chicken this is the type of stuff they push constantly
[48:43.440 --> 48:48.960]  and trumps like sitting there grabbing hispanic woman i love the one i love hispanic people
[48:48.960 --> 48:51.680]  you know and other people that know trump that's what he's like behind the scenes
[48:53.760 --> 48:57.280]  like two or three steaks piles of potatoes running around hugging everybody
[48:57.280 --> 49:01.760]  just completely out of control 18 hours a day he's probably got some chromosomal issue or
[49:01.760 --> 49:06.480]  something you know like a superman or something a super orange pumpkin man but and he makes fun
[49:06.480 --> 49:11.920]  of himself by the way behind the scenes but all of this turns into he's a racist no he gets the
[49:11.920 --> 49:17.600]  intel this judge is a la rosa la rica enquista met mexican nationalist you know guy and he goes
[49:17.600 --> 49:23.200]  the guy's a mexican he doesn't want a border he's he's he's he's loyal to mexico okay i honor him
[49:23.200 --> 49:28.560]  he's proud of his of that country this is america and this guy shouldn't be able to rule obviously
[49:28.560 --> 49:34.720]  he should recuse himself but the media spins that all up here's another one half a million veterans
[49:34.720 --> 49:42.080]  waiting over 30 days for va care but that's okay new surge in central americans seen on
[49:42.080 --> 49:46.960]  border biggest ever pbs my against these poor people know that they're being used as a weapon
[49:46.960 --> 49:54.560]  to come in and break the country and create a tower of babel dhs quietly moving releasing
[49:54.560 --> 49:59.760]  van loads of illegal aliens away from border told you that years ago now it's confirmed judicial
[49:59.760 --> 50:04.560]  watch oh i love this one i just mentioned it illegals openly brag about 30 000 k scholarships
[50:04.560 --> 50:10.400]  on twitter that they're getting from the government and from the states and again they brag
[50:10.400 --> 50:22.560]  4.5 gpa full tuition paid at ut 13 cords metals nice legs oh and i'm undocumented

[50:35.440 --> 50:39.280]  like that everything else we should just have a law just like you go fight in the military boom
[50:39.280 --> 50:43.840]  you're a citizen ranked ninth and it goes on right here i'm also undocumented so it's the
[50:43.840 --> 50:48.320]  thing about saying undocumented are valuable i get all that but see the citizens aren't getting
[50:48.320 --> 50:52.800]  stuff like this in many cases and this is being done to incentivize and then you're put through
[50:52.800 --> 50:57.760]  the chicano programs at the schools which is basically the equivalent of you're a victim
[50:57.760 --> 51:02.720]  everybody's out to hate you only the socialists love you only gloria steinham loves you all sex is

[51:24.480 --> 51:31.680]  with their new computers they know areas that have low welfare areas that have high employment
[51:31.680 --> 51:37.440]  areas they're doing well they're going to create little government nest in that and bring in people
[51:37.440 --> 51:42.480]  break down the society and the culture and not let anyone escape the poverty anyone escape the
[51:42.480 --> 51:48.880]  collapsing uh tax base and then meanwhile i mentioned this earlier here's the story up on
[51:48.880 --> 51:54.400]  info wars dot com school calls sheriff on seven-year-old for sharing bible verses i see this all the
[51:54.400 --> 51:59.200]  time california elementary school sent deputy to boys home for distributing christian materials
[51:59.200 --> 52:06.160]  the desert rose elementary school in palm dale california severely abused the first graders
[52:06.160 --> 52:10.480]  constitutional rise according to a press release put out by the liberty council the boys mother
[52:10.480 --> 52:16.560]  christina zalvala as i pronounced that right oh look a hispanic person i think being abused
[52:16.560 --> 52:22.160]  oh for their christianity seek they hate everybody's guts folks put a bible verse on a sticky note
[52:22.160 --> 52:27.680]  in her son's packed lunch every day along with a short story to provide context for the verses
[52:27.680 --> 52:33.040]  my mother used to do that for me christina's son known as c began sharing notes with other children
[52:33.040 --> 52:38.400]  during lunch he communicated with free speech his mother's words and talked about christ
[52:38.960 --> 52:42.480]  see you have free speech folks now they say separation church estate means you have no religion
[52:43.680 --> 52:47.440]  but that all came to an end when the young girl showed one note to her teacher saying it was the
[52:47.440 --> 52:52.560]  most beautiful story she'd ever seen at which point the teacher told c he could no longer

[55:19.520 --> 55:23.680]  all i know is they see it a lot more i'm not defending every judge out there but i'm just
[55:23.680 --> 55:28.080]  telling you you know there's a lot of stuff going on here there's more than one way to skin a cat
[55:28.080 --> 55:33.120]  hillary begs bernie to drop out as she clenches the nomination the media says she stole most delegates

[55:37.840 --> 55:42.880]  drudge report dot com it's on info wars dot com we got it they put it out on their official website
[55:42.880 --> 55:47.760]  we wrote a story around it that's coming up and it is your purchase of the products that makes it
[55:47.760 --> 55:55.840]  all possible now joining us is dr ebert group one of the top nutraceutical producers in the country
[55:55.840 --> 55:59.200]  who has so many patents that makes my head spin and who produces the line of products from
[55:59.200 --> 56:03.520]  fourslife.com we have a limited run of one thousand of these i want to know your reviews
[56:03.520 --> 56:06.960]  i want you to get it we have a few minutes here in five minutes the next segment to talk about it
[56:06.960 --> 56:13.680]  but this is so important because it's ozonated pure olive oil organic skin moisturizer
[56:13.680 --> 56:17.040]  that that that we've been using for six months behind the scenes it's been years in the making
[56:17.040 --> 56:22.160]  leon macadoo has been so blown away by it the problem is is that group blew up a facility
[56:22.160 --> 56:27.680]  making it once because it's so hard to contain the ozone in a true gas form it's safe once it's in
[56:27.680 --> 56:32.960]  the bottle with the olive oil so it actually oxygenates and is basically living and i'm if i'm
[56:32.960 --> 56:39.920]  saying this correct dr group instead of just being dead oil on your body it actually bio activates
[56:39.920 --> 56:45.760]  is that a fair way of saying it dr group yeah it is uh i did actually almost blow up the facility
[56:45.760 --> 56:51.440]  it all started with we talk about all the internal toxins all the time coming into the body but i was
[56:51.440 --> 56:57.680]  also looking for you know the different types of toxins that affect the skin and what is the ultimate
[56:57.680 --> 57:03.920]  skin care product and that led me back to nicolai tesla's research and he actually created an
[57:03.920 --> 57:09.600]  ozonated olive oil by bubbling ozone through it for a long period of time sometimes it takes
[57:09.600 --> 57:15.920]  up to six months to get the olive olive oil to change into a paste so it's not necessarily a
[57:15.920 --> 57:21.680]  liquid olive oil that's been ozonated this is a chemical process that takes place over a long
[57:21.680 --> 57:26.240]  period of time you're not putting gimmicks out that's why your iodine you produce for us your
[57:26.240 --> 57:32.560]  super mail all of it are such game changers even with the nutraceutical and supplement nazis out
[57:32.560 --> 57:39.680]  there on the big third party sites they absolutely love our products yeah this is what you would
[57:39.680 --> 57:48.000]  consider as the ultimate luxury skin care product i mean it releases oxygen onto the skin we've been
[57:48.000 --> 57:54.160]  testing this for close to 15 years some of the most exclusive luxury spas around the world use
[57:54.160 --> 58:00.880]  this for oxygen facials and charge $250 per facial it's a hundred percent organic it's been
[58:00.880 --> 58:08.560]  known to stimulate and grow skin cells it protects the skin from toxic products you know look at most
[58:08.560 --> 58:14.400]  skin care products out there including sunscreen alex cause severe damage to the skin so i was
[58:14.400 --> 58:17.760]  a group stay there because i went to you late i got so wound up i want you to come back and take
[58:17.760 --> 58:22.480]  your time talking about this because that's the key similar formulas aren't even as good as yours
[58:22.480 --> 58:27.680]  out there i happen to know because i've seen it are a hundred two hundred dollars because it's like
[58:27.680 --> 58:31.680]  a hundred bucks just for the treatment than a hundred bucks for the person to do the treatment
[58:31.680 --> 58:35.840]  the esthetician so we're talking about twenty nine dollars it should be 40 but we're discounting it

[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:32.800]  we have this as an exclusive just so you know and it's a big deal you notice that
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:37.200]  newt genrich has been out attacking attacking donald trump a lot lately claiming he was his big
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:42.480]  buddy all along and i said don't trust newt genrich well report trump refused 200 million to pick
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:46.880]  genrich as vp that's on info wars.com we're going to be talking about that coming up in
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.960]  the next segment then we'll talk to our reporters out on the west coast for this big primary day
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.800]  2016 and then we'll go to germany with our reporters on the ground there they've been inside
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:59.360]  the belterberg hotel um i'm told they're trying to throw them out basically right now they have
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.720]  the german military they're putting up fences but we only have a little bit of time dr. group thank
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:07.600]  you for your time start over with how you develop this why it's so important and why it's such a
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:15.760]  game changer of ozonated olive oil skin mortgaging uh conditioner why this 1.7 fluid ounce uh paste
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:23.040]  is is is so important well because i was looking for the most effective non-toxic organic skin
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:29.840]  care product that would actually stimulate and renew the epidermis which is the epidermal cells
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:36.000]  on your skin so many people put so many toxins on their skin and our skin is exposed to toxins in
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.040]  the air every day too our skin loves oxygen but we're not getting oxygen on our skin because
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:46.160]  the oxygen content content is decreasing in the atmosphere all over the world so i was looking
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:52.400]  for to develop the most ultimate luxury skincare product that's out there and it was based on
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:58.320]  nicolai tesla's research back in the early days where he started ozonating olive oil and it would
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:03.600]  turn into a white thick paste but it's very dangerous to do because ozone generates a lot of
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:09.120]  heat and the equipment necessary for that is extremely expensive and we spent close to 250
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:14.080]  thousand dollars just on some of the equipment alone and it takes a long time you have to bubble
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:19.920]  ozone at certain temperatures through a period of time it can take three to six months depending
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:25.440]  on what type of olive oil you're using and also depending on the atmospheric pressure currently
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:33.200]  in that time period so what you end up with is you end up with this paste and at the end uh it is
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:38.800]  extremely effective to use for all different types of skin conditions over the last 15 years we've
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:45.520]  tested it on practically everything and you know some of the most luxurious spas around the country
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:51.760]  charge three or four hundred dollars sometimes for oxygen facials it's a hundred percent organic
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:57.440]  it's going to provide oxygen to the skin it's going to neutralize any chemicals and toxins that are
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:04.160]  on the skin because a skin is an exposure point to toxins and you do suck in chemicals and toxins
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:11.600]  through the skin as well so that helps reduce the amount of the chemicals and toxins coming in it
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:18.480]  reduces swelling and redness it calms the nerves and reduces the amount of pain it increases a lot
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:23.440]  of times because it's expensive i mean alex this could sell for hundreds of dollars because there's
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.640]  always a limited supply there's only so much we can make we can only make three or four hundred
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:35.440]  bottles it's all handmade at a time so it really is a luxury ultimate skin product so a lot of
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:42.800]  people just use it for their face it works as a conditioner really for anti-aging wrinkles
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:49.520]  but also people use it for so many other things i use it for anytime my kids get injured they have
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:57.360]  cuts burns scrapes on their skin the the beautiful thing about ozonated olive oil is is it doesn't
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:04.000]  leave scarring women love it for cellulite reduction i mean it minimizes the appearance of
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.880]  cellulite or stretch marks i guess when they're pregnant and in the third trimester expanding
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:14.960]  on this you're not kidding around because we all have wives girlfriends uh and over the years and
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:19.680]  know that women go to these hundred dollar two hundred dollar three hundred dollar facials and these
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:25.120]  oxygen based ones are amongst the most expensive this is a super high quality product uh it's
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:30.800]  concentrated oxygen and ozone that then releases on the skin in organic concentrated olive oil
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:36.960]  that's in a thick concentrated paste uh it's amazing and it's really important people understand we
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:40.560]  can sell this right now for forty dollars introductory twenty nine ninety five and then we have a
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.040]  i just really want to give people the very best insane deal out there and i just hope doctor group's
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:49.840]  able to produce a lot more because this stuff will sell out today and the small profit we make
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:55.840]  helps fund our reporters being all over the world uh reporting on game changing news thank you doctor
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:02.720]  group great job god bless you thank you take care get it today in four store dot com hillary clinton
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:09.440]  has no shortage of celebrity endorsements including actress eva longoria snoop d o double g and kim
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:15.760]  cardassian now she's gaining support from an unlikely source for a very bizarre reason scott adams
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:21.440]  the creator of the long-lived comic strip series dillbert is endorsing hillary out of fear for his
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:27.200]  personal safety despite never having endorsed donald trump adams says he's already been on the
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:33.360]  receiving end of criticism from hillary supporters labeling him a trump apologist angels of gerbils
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:39.360]  the head of hitler's ministry of propaganda adams posted this on his blog trump took her so called
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:45.360]  woman card and turned it into a liability so clinton wisely pivoted her new scare tactics
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:51.120]  are solid gold persuasion i wouldn't be surprised if you see clinton's numbers versus trump improve
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:58.320]  in june at least temporarily until trump finds a counter move you can find more reports on info wars
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:05.920]  dot com more than two years ago info wars first told you about our research into what has been
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:11.120]  called the iodine conspiracy i've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:17.040]  deficiencies can devastate iq and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:22.240]  and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they took the good halogen
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:27.760]  out and put the deadly halogen in and when the fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:34.000]  today i was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family now in 2016 even more
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.280]  information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut which many
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:44.800]  experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine you can pull
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:49.760]  these studies up for yourself this is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential

[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:10.240]  there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the warriors
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:17.520]  of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:24.560]  approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:30.480]  there are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water and the lining of
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:36.880]  plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:43.280]  i personally counter this onslaught with antroplex antroplex is designed with known

[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:23.600]  there's a war on for your mind ladies and gentlemen we're back live and now into the second hour
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:28.400]  we're going to have our reporters joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour from outside
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.480]  resident germany where the bill berg group is meeting this is the group whose own documents
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:37.680]  the last 50 years have been leaked to the bbc and ourselves and others where they admit
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.880]  they're setting up a planetary government they're going to use third world populations to drive
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:46.000]  down wages they're going to use the imploding third world to then flood the west causing a
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  crisis that crisis will be used to bring an authoritarian control and a global government
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.280]  to manage the collapsing third world because you got to have a global government to control the
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:05.520]  collapsing five plus billion six billion people trying to get into the first world that conservatively
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:12.160]  maybe has 900 million people in it more of them living in third world conditions
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:18.080]  the carrying weight of the planet the globalists say is about to implode but they're the ones
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:25.920]  undermining it and blocking innovation and then hoarding the technology and good developments
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:31.280]  for themselves in tax exempt corporate and governmental combines there's an article coming
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:34.240]  up by curtain demo that's excellent that i'll be covering later when we get into bill berg
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:44.000]  engineer decarbonization will result in mass starvation poverty and civil strife that's what
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.480]  the british ministry of defense said too in 2007 because it's the plan he says co2 is beneficial
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:55.520]  not detrimental that's like saying sunshine is beneficial or water is beneficial or mommy is
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:10:00.720]  beneficial a university of cambridge engineering professor we're going to get on warns that the
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:04.880]  globalist effort to cut carbon emissions will result in widespread property starvation and
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:10.560]  civil strife mj kelly i want to get them on everything i cover in my film in game with the
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:17.040]  globalist emissions of within the first 10 years of the carbon taxes they've wanted it would cause
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:25.280]  conservatively one billion deaths we've already seen world starvation numbers go from about 25
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:31.200]  million a decade ago to over 45 million a year more than half of those children you say well
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:35.200]  that's how we get rid of too many people okay but the globalists are setting up economic systems
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:42.320]  to cut development off i mean at least you know have the courtesy to go shoot them in the head
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:47.920]  and get it over with quickly so this is soft kill this isn't this is nazi germany 2.0 this is
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:54.320]  nazi germany coming back home now i'm about to go to leon macadoo here in a moment uh who is on the
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:11:00.240]  ground in long beach california uh she's going to be at polling locations today filing reports
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:05.200]  to info wars dot com and prison planet dot com with exit polls she's also going to be covering any
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:11.120]  civil unrest that comes if this is stolen from sanders and she's also going to be at the democratic
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:17.120]  primary event uh so big's is going to be going to bernie primary event and i'll be popping in
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:22.240]  during the fourth hour today he'll also be reporting on the bedlam he videotaped uh monday and over
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:27.440]  the weekend with the rioting um people with mexican flags beating up any hispanics that
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:31.600]  dare try to go to a trump rally of course those folks did did did fight back i can say that's
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:35.600]  better than the white yuppies who don't ever seem to fight back i don't get why white people are so
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:39.760]  wimpy but oh i mean let me just say something that's that's cliched i guess that's what it's
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:46.160]  turned into uh but but this is the type of stuff that's going on and i i want to get leon's take
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:50.480]  on this though because bernie's gotten more real delegates but hillary appoints super delegates
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:55.600]  and it's stolen more than 10 states from so a lot of the math shows he's the winner but even with
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.200]  hillary and the media pushing her as the winner some people wanted to bet on the winner so they
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:03.120]  started voting more for her the last month but still it's neck and neck and bernie says he's
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:09.520]  going to go to the deal in philadelphia and fight it and so oh they're getting the riot police ready
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:14.160]  because you know bernie sanders are troublemakers well they actually are but they're actually in the
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.640]  right when they talk about hillary stealing it they're not in the right beating up folks just
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:23.280]  trying to go see what donald trump has to say a lot of them aren't even supporters so leon
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:29.200]  macadoo joining us via video connection from southern california leon what are your observations
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:34.800]  what's your take what are you expecting to see hi there alex yes we are right outside of a polling
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.680]  location here in long beach of the long beach civic center uh there was kind of a rush this morning
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:44.400]  people trying to get in get their votes before they headed into work uh be sort of slow trickle
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:48.960]  throughout the day but what we've spoken to some people here at the polling location and they said
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:54.240]  that there's a lot of upset a lot of people are really upset they're wanting to see some sort of a
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:13:00.240]  surprise and then of course this morning perfectly timed with people who are about to go vote in the
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:05.600]  california primaries that hey you know what hillary clinton according to some super secret
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:11.520]  super delegate they've already all decided that she's going to be making history as the first female
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:16.800]  uh nominee for a part this party here for the democratic party so they put that out there
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:23.360]  perfectly timed to almost uh take the burst the bubble out of people who are wanting bernie to win
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:27.680]  and who are going to get out the vote and vote for bernie today so it's going to be really
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:32.960]  interesting to see exactly what happens if bernie is able to rally the support of all of these young
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:39.680]  people here in california and get the vote out and then will the people's voice speak yet hillary
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:45.200]  still steals it anyway with her super delegates totally undemocratic process that's right and six
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:51.920]  states are going to the polls on the democratic side with a total of 694 delegates at stake the most
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:57.360]  important of them obviously is california which has 475 of those delegates that's the biggest state
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:02.480]  biggest population and where polls close at 11 p.m eastern time 8 p.m pacific we're going to have
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:07.440]  extended coverage on info wars nightly news tonight after the news we're going to have some live coverage
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:12.400]  of this final and quite frankly most important primary when i say final it'll be it'll be a
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:17.920]  shoe in now after this the second biggest prizes in new jersey with 126 delegates uh are at stake
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:24.320]  polls close at 8 p.m eastern we have new mexico montana south dakota and north dakota as well
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:30.000]  and we're going to have leon macadoo joe bags uh and others out there reporting on what's happening
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:38.240]  on the west coast leon looking at this uh i have a friend for many years ago as a prominent democrat
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:46.320]  here in austin texas and he gave me a call this morning to snicker and laugh at me and say the
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:52.480]  word is uh you know donald trump's gonna lose hillary's ahead polls show 10 points well most
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.000]  people are intimidated just you know to say they're not gonna vote for trump is the racism charge
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.760]  plus a lot of other scientific polls show him three four points ahead so they're trying to sell
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:04.480]  this idea just like with sanders that she's undefeatable even though he'd have 50 000 in a rally
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:09.920]  10 000 in the rally she'd have 500 a thousand max there's no one that i find supporting hillary even
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:15.200]  here in austin texas 90 of liberals i know hater but not the guy that called me laughing at me this
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:19.040]  morning they're already getting the big fix in they're already getting ready to just steal it
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:24.960]  and hand it to her leon absolutely and that's what people are finally able to see this election
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:30.240]  cycle we've talked about it for many many years but now the mass of people can see that this is a
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:35.440]  totally undemocratic process these superdelegates are set up to make sure that the american people
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:40.720]  are never able to elect someone that will actually represent them the party will not allow that to
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:45.520]  happen and there's actually a really interesting story coming out of the la times kind of tying
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:50.240]  in what you were talking about earlier about the globalization uh how they're flooding the west with
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:55.520]  people who aren't loyal and don't have any national instincts there with their with their countries
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:59.520]  that's what's happening here in california now we've been talking about how the left has been
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:04.160]  flooding america with all types of illegal immigrants that don't have any loyalty to this
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.920]  country and they think they're going to be loyal to the democratic party because they want all that
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:14.000]  free stuff well it turns out that they're actually seeing a surge in latino voters who are vote
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.440]  um registering themselves as nonpartisan so they're not loyal to the democratic party nor are they
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:24.320]  loyal to the republican party so basically what the left has done has flooded our country
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.240]  with a bunch of people who aren't loyal to anyone and they're not even loyal to this country
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:32.880]  and they're really upset with the fact that the democrats have made all of these promises to them
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:36.960]  and haven't followed through well that's the issue i mean on average black americans have
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:40.480]  been screwed over by the democrats worse than anybody but there's all these platitudes and
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:46.560]  words but doubling the unemployment under obama uh but historically hispanic voters are not going
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:51.040]  to go that way i don't know why culturally that's different but but when the quote democrats don't
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:56.400]  deliver uh or deliver some scam it's it's not going to go well uh and that's really more of the
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:00.560]  democrats wanting voters the big multinational corporations want to drive down wages i mean
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:05.440]  that's really what this is about it's what uh perot warned about the giant sucking sound
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.320]  where things are so bad in areas of mexico they got to come up here for jobs i mean nafta and gata
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:15.040]  has been a disaster for everybody but the elites right and i think a lot of people are starting to
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:18.720]  see that with the trade agreements and the big thing here in california the big thing that's
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:23.920]  pushing the voting here is immigration and so that's been the main kicker for a lot of the
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:29.040]  latino voters is getting this immigration passed but what is going to happen if they do open the
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:34.400]  borders if it is good it's the economy stupid then once you all get here what are we going to do for
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:40.160]  jobs sure it's going to affect everyone it's not like we border switzerland okay uh we border a failed
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:44.800]  state that's collapsing and i like mexico a lot of cool stuff but i mean we're going to be a failed
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:50.400]  state too so you know don't feel too too arrogant folks looking at mexico or venezuela uh look at
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:55.520]  what's happening in spain and in greece and ireland's in trouble i mean the whole world is teetering
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:01.520]  because less and less people are working the governments are raising taxes by design to
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:08.880]  implode the carrying capacity of the planet they are collapsing it by design mayday mayday this is
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:14.960]  a planned program and bernie sanders will only make it worse but regardless it shows people are
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:19.200]  going for who they see as the outside candidate they are going for a trump they're going for a
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:23.840]  sanders even there's problems with both of them and so trump and sanders for me and are only a
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:28.560]  manifestation of the anger and the upsetness of people and it's not going to go away if they put
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:33.840]  hillary clinton in absolutely not she's just symbolic it's just like with obama he was the
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:38.240]  first african-american president she's it's all symbolic she's going to be the first female
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:42.880]  president and it's it's it's symbolism it's she's not actually going to change the country
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:47.040]  it's just going to be more of the same and even worse with hillary clinton because she's a total
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:53.040]  warmonger total corporate elitist she's a huge sellout so we're going to get more of the same
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:58.800]  it's crazy i mean the u.s is collapsing in many areas uh our protectorates are collapsing
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:03.440]  more than half the counties and cities in california are already been bankrupt for years
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:09.200]  they're getting propped up with more fiat garbage uh we just saw uh portorico go completely belly up
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:15.200]  and default i mean this is a time bomb on a time bomb and people just laugh and joke and go you
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:19.520]  know oh we're gonna beat up hispanics trying to go to a trump rally because we're hispanic we're
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:26.480]  waving bernie signs and want free stuff with him going it's all gonna be free like venezuela
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:33.200]  and he's in speeches saying venezuela should be our model the place is on fire leon yeah you don't
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:36.880]  see basically what they're saying is all the people lining up for bernie sanders are just
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:42.560]  practicing for the bread lines that they're gonna be lining up for years soon so well well leon

[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:33.360]  turned out was on a bunch of steroids but what's interesting about working with tim kennedy is
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:37.680]  that most of what he's done is secret and he won't be getting into any of that with us obviously
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:42.080]  here on air he's been bringing all his expertise uh when he's been in the most elite army units
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:46.160]  there are and and joint units there's only really one joint unit everybody knows what that is delta
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:51.600]  force and uh beyond chris kyle and i'm not taking anything away from chris kyle uh but this is the
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:57.440]  super soldier and uh they'd been trying to train them to take the guns and stuff and he and the
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:03.040]  mus army are away just like they said no to al qaeda and said no to funding isis four years ago
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:08.720]  and now that's all been declassified in the news and tim kennedy goes around with the with the
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:14.000]  pentagon doing doing pro military pro veteran promotions and um you know at the level of the
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.240]  u.s army they're even pretty much done with a globalist uh tim kennedy is going to be joining
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:22.800]  the info or just telling you that right now and other people as well because there's a real fight
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:26.400]  for this republic and people are going to start seeing the real response in the defense of this
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:32.080]  country this is only the beginning all right uh yeah we built it and they came leon macadoo uh
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:36.960]  wow so much going on you saw the joe biggs footage you've seen people being attacked
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:40.880]  just yesterday hispanics getting attacked because they're out on the street trying to vote for
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:45.520]  trump uh we're hearing there's going to be a tax at some of the polling places they attack women
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:51.280]  too so uh you wanted to go out there but please be safe yeah i i thank you alex i'm definitely
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:55.760]  going to be watching my back i've got zimmerman out here uh unfortunately biggs is going to be in
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:00.720]  a different location but i think we're going to be all right but yeah i am expecting some excitement
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:06.640]  i think on either end if if bernie wins california but it still goes to hillary i think all of the
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:13.120]  the people that we've been seeing getting rowdy at uh at these rallies are gonna be out in full
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:19.040]  effect tonight so we'll see we'll see what happens i know i would be pretty i should go out there but
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:23.440]  i wanted biggs to be with you i'm not gonna be patronizing but i mean i'd be concerned out there
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.960]  i want a few guys with me so you're gonna be with biggs right because you guys are split up right
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:31.360]  now well we're split up right now biggs is going to be at the bernie sanders event and we are going
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:36.880]  to go try to get to where the hillary clinton supporters are at uh but we might end up being
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:40.960]  where biggs is at if that seems to well zimmerman's a big guy so hopefully you guys can protect each
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:46.960]  other yeah he doesn't have his his uh he's not carrying right now so that's kind of a letdown for
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:55.120]  me but we are here in this liberal utopia california which is like a totally rundown state i just i
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:59.360]  can't even describe it looks like a third world country here in a lot of the parts of california
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:04.400]  listen i was there a few years ago and i said i'm not coming back unless i have to i was sitting
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:08.400]  there out by a pool with a butler i was at a hollywood stars house and what charlie shes was
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:14.800]  on and bringing me like for a goa and there was ashes raining down on me and and like you know
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:19.760]  three women and bikinis out by the pool with ashes with fires a mile away and i said this is
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:26.640]  like hell i'm getting out of here yeah i mean we're just looking around and just unbelievable
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:30.800]  i mean california is one of the one of the youngest states in the nation and it looks
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:36.320]  so rundown what happened how could this have happened in this liberal mecca well it's because
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:39.520]  they have some of the highest taxes in the country and they're only getting higher lian but
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:44.240]  but whenever uh trump comes out and says they're shutting off the water that's causing a lot of
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:48.560]  the farmers a lot of business they write articles saying he's a liar but they shut off three major
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:54.640]  lakes in northern california that destroyed over 100 000 farmers that's admitted right by the way
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:28:00.800]  some of those farmers are tim kennedy's family uh you know original californians are like as texas
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:05.360]  as texas are more like i remember all these californians that are fourth fifth generation
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:09.120]  and there is cool anybody i know that's like seventh generation texan and they'll tell you
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:13.120]  they go stop saying california is a bunch of evil people with we're not folks from all over the
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:17.440]  country came there in the world to get a free deal the communists destroyed california
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:23.280]  exactly well and that's what we're starting to see trickling out in austin because as we know texas
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:28.800]  is great but then you've got austin starting to get full on democratic representation there so it's
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:35.280]  kind of don't bring the locus here all right lian great job by the way i love that green jacket
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:40.400]  you know that's my favorite thank you mine too i tell that's that's that's the irish in you
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:46.320]  but seriously what else are you gonna be covering well we are also gonna be out here we wanted to
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:50.880]  talk a little bit about how uh what a what a clinton presidency would look like we're outside of the
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:56.720]  laugh factory and you can recall we did that whole uh series with people submitting their videos
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:01.680]  trying to insult hillary clinton because she wanted to shut down people's free speech if they
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:06.000]  dare make jokes about her so that's just one of the things going on here out in california with
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.400]  the laugh factory and we'll we'll kind of be bouncing bouncing all around here meeting up with
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:15.200]  some of her seeing if we can actually find any hillary clinton supporters i have yet to find
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:22.240]  one leon tell folks how they find oh so that's key i mean do report on that uh yeah a reporter

[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:18.640]  and it numbers in the hundreds for the first time showing the extent to which the agency
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:25.360]  slow walked applications for tax exempt status reports fox news the new list shows a total of
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:31.840]  426 organizations far higher than what the treasury department's inspector general believed there to
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:38.720]  be back in may 2013 when he identified nearly 300 groups the names banned the gamut covering well
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:44.640]  known groups like the tea party patriots but also lower profile locals like the louisiana campaign
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:51.200]  for liberty patriots of charleston the asfield tea party incorporated and many more a federal judge

[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:32.400]  life dot com uh buying a lot of hillary for prison shirts buying a lot of molan lambe shirts
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:39.680]  wearing those colors loud and proud meeting like-minded people i just love seeing the live footage
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:47.680]  and covering it myself a few times seeing black white hispanic male female wearing
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:53.600]  molan lambe shirts wearing hillary for prison shirts and and unifying humanity around freedom
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:58.880]  um that absolutely freaks out obama and the globalists they do not want to show the crowds
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:03.760]  of people of every race color and creed going into these trump rallies they do not they want
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:08.960]  to spin it and make it look like trump is a racist that is what they're pushing as hard as they can
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:14.480]  but it's not working we're also pushing a big hoax that hillary's ahead of him in every poll
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:18.880]  just like she's ahead of bernie sanders right oh no the super delegates stole more than 10 states
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:24.720]  for her and now sanders to his credit saying we're still going to fight at the convention because
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:29.840]  we've got the delegates and the super delegates don't speak for the voters they've never implemented
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:33.920]  this before they're doing this because they've got candidates they don't want like trump and
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:38.640]  sanders i got problems with both sanders and trump a lot less with trump obviously i admire his
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:43.520]  courage agree with a lot of what he has to say but he says some stuff i don't agree with the way he
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:49.360]  put the mexican judge thing i got it in the full context but it was just giving him a weapon
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:56.080]  but maybe that's his plan knowing it would all come out later it's just a complex issue now
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:01.200]  before i go to rob do and josh owens there a lot has happened since they were on with us
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:05.520]  yesterday we've gotten the bill berg list we've gotten the intel it's up on drudgereport.com
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:10.320]  it's the bill berg group that is the most important private organizational meeting it's
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:14.880]  it's a specter meeting and george sorrell basically runs the show now it used to be david
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:18.880]  rockefeller but he's faded off he's not there this year with a bunch of british and dutch royalty
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:24.240]  and soddies and you name it chinese have been kicked out of them for about four years showing
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:31.040]  that big split is real and they are outside the hotel where the bill berg group is going to be
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:35.120]  meeting this year they've been able to get inside and get footage but they always try to push people
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:40.000]  out for me talking to them in a moment but before we go to dresden germany
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:49.920]  tim kennedy uh it was number two middle heavyweight narrowly lost hasn't fought in a year or two
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:53.680]  because she doesn't like some of the ufc deals where they don't even let you have sponsorship
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:58.880]  now you can't have names on your trunks you can't even pay yourself basically it's a joke uh i mean
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:05.280]  i thought that uh but boxing you know had some heads and i'm not i know dana white i've met him
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:11.280]  i'm friends with joe rogan i've been out to fights in vegas i mean i've but at the same time i'm
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:16.720]  not really a big ufc fan because i'm not into sports and seeing guys beat the hell out of each
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:21.360]  other i admire them it's it's it's it's interesting i'm all for contact sports it's just that i'm so
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:25.120]  into the second amendment and other political issues i don't have time to focus on it but i
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:28.880]  have followed tim kennedy because he's lived an awesome many years he's been friends with my high
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:34.640]  school buddy shane steiner for many years who folks know and they're an old famous rodeo family and
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:40.320]  texas family and our families go back some strange even though when i met him in high
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:43.760]  school when i moved down here i didn't know my grandfather knew his his grandfather and great
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:50.640]  grandfather buck steiner but it's a small world and then my dad had family that actually ran whiskey
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:56.640]  with them during prohibition and stuff like that out of houston al capone was even involved you can't
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:00.400]  make look a buck steiner al capone if you think i'm kidding uh but they're great folks is what i'm
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:06.080]  saying pure americana and i was like yeah tim kennedy so i started having dinner a few times
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:10.560]  hanging out with and then come by the office we go over to the gym watch him work out anthony's
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:14.720]  trying to work out with him a little bit these guys work out all over town for like twice a day
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:19.840]  three hours a day and then go out and shoot and do all the rest of it and then i talked to some of
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:24.960]  my army buddies and and people i know that are retired or been in special forces and they said
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:30.160]  well you know tim kennedy's like been in more combat probably than even somebody like uh the
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:35.280]  legend uh chris kyle and i didn't know those guys have been friends years in iraq where the army and
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:39.760]  the marines uh worked with each other and overwatch and underwatch nighttime watch daytime watch all
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:45.760]  this other stuff uh and that they'd you know actually been in uh you know contact a lot but
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:49.680]  the thing is the army doesn't let the navy seal group do what they do they don't write books
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:53.680]  about it they don't talk about it they don't do it because the army's obviously contingent with
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:59.520]  special forces probably has what ten times what the navy does but from folks that know tim kennedy
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:04.800]  won't brag on himself this guy when it comes being a sniper right there with chris kyle um
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:10.960]  but only a legend in the army and when it comes to just all the things he's done it's amazing
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:15.680]  there's not just sniping but commando raids taking out top terrorist you name and he's been there
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:23.200]  and the interesting part is he's been a listener for years but his grandmother and
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:27.520]  family were end of the new world order and fighting it their farmers from california
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:31.120]  they've been attacked by having their water supply turned off and now they try to train the
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:36.080]  military for gun confiscation and taking over capitals and uh checkpoints and martial law and
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:41.040]  all the rest of it so that's really woken the military up and in kennedy's not telling me any
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:46.320]  of this i already know all this it's public but he said yeah folks are awake yes it's true
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.760]  but i have all my other sources i mean i had kernels on and like schaefer and others
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:56.880]  four days after Benghazi saying it was an order stand down by hillary to ship missiles
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:02.640]  into syria and start the next wave and the next is europe that's all been declassified now judicial
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:07.680]  watch came out a year ago with the headline let me give it to you secret pentagon report reveals us
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:14.400]  created ices as a tool to overthrow syria's president Assad close quote and it was tim kennedy
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:19.600]  and people who were there saying we're not going to be part of this so this is a big deal and i'm
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:24.320]  just excited that uh tim kennedy's me doing a lot of production with us he's going to be but
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:31.440]  everything from organic farming to amish and milk and to weightlifting to shooting uh to just the
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:37.040]  philosophy of a true patriot dangerous patriot bringing back men bringing back families bringing
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:44.800]  back women bringing back americana bringing back real preparation with somebody that didn't tell
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:49.200]  me this but i know it and looked it up as true as you know run the presidential security details
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:53.040]  you know delta force assigned to tim i can map it i already know the stuff from other people
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:57.120]  the point is just great to have somebody like this working with info wars because he's a total
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:01.600]  patriot we've got a four minute video we talked about the second amendment we're going to be airing
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:05.760]  towards the end of the third hour today but there's going to be lots of this and then of course as he
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:11.120]  goes in coming up soon for the championship and the rest of it i'm not going to get into that
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:17.520]  it's going to be a big deal for info wars and the fight against tyranny and the military and good
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:22.240]  parts of our government are so angry at the globalist and obama and this attempted takeover of the
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:26.880]  country and the missile secrets of the chinese and the rest of it that tim kennedy's his own man
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:32.400]  and does what he wants to do has a lot of courage to be doing this but there's a lot of folks not
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:36.400]  in their heads to him and i'm just going to leave it at that show this is a real defense of this
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:40.320]  republic and so i would expect people like tim kennedy to want to work with info wars
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:45.120]  at a critical juncture like this in history now this promo video we're about to promote
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:49.520]  and premiere he's going to go up on info wars dot com the next 30 minutes or so we're going to
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:52.720]  encode it and upload it and give it a great title i don't know what to call it it's so cool
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:42:00.400]  it's only a minute long and this is just one day of shooting they did uh on sniper training and on
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:06.320]  weightlifting and on search and rescue outside austin texas there's going to be a lot more of this
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:10.640]  integrated into what we do won't be shooting shows with me out there like you'll somebody
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:15.440]  sam it'll be shooting shows and things with tim kennedy and the craziest part other really famous
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:20.160]  people want to be involved separately that just so happened to live here in austin texas so it's
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:25.760]  it's just there's a lot of patriots just magically coming together uh so let's go ahead and play uh
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:33.760]  this piece again it's not really for radio so i'm going to narrate some of it but here it is
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:35.760]  true patriot this is just the beginning
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:42.800]  that's not a drone that's a helicopter coming in
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:51.600]  this video will be on info wars dot com the next hour
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:00.960]  all gunning from helicopters you got it and we're training nice and spaces oh shouldn't
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:16.880]  decide haha oh yeah i heard a little birdie told me we might have info wars reporting from syria
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.400]  if i was just gonna like attach an idea to it it's gonna be dangerous freedom
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:32.640]  start down your path to freedom now info wars dot com forward slash true patriot
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:35.760]  we're going to send that link out of that video out to everybody the next hour but this is such
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:41.040]  an exciting time i look at rob do who we're about to go to and josh owens warriors for this republic
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:46.560]  and freedom worldwide tim kennedy chain steiner and the editors of the video and everybody that
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:50.560]  made it possible like like buckling everybody else we're in a real fight here we're not asking
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:54.800]  for you to admire us we're saying join us this is history we're not going to just bow down to
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:59.360]  hillary clinton and george soros the new world order our own military went to obama the chairman
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:04.640]  of the joint chiefs four years ago and said we're not going to attack syria with air power in fact
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:09.280]  we're taking al-qaeda and ices out and we're going to give the russians the intel to do it
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:15.040]  the colonel shaffer came on and said that meeting happened and three years later cyhurst published
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:21.440]  it in new yorker magazine and in the london review of books exactly what we told you and broke here
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:27.680]  the good people in the military came here to tell you they were trying to not be traders
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:33.120]  and going up against the criminals that have hijacked this nation you understand i'm not
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:38.080]  bragging that we're at the center of the zeitgeist i'm just telling you when you see info wars this
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:45.120]  is a hundred and ten percent attempt at giving you the bottom line truth straight shooting you texas style
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:51.840]  and if i'm lying i'm dying the truth is the only reason evil men and tyrants flourish is that good
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:56.320]  men and women do nothing to quote thomas jefferson well guess what good men are doing something
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:02.240]  and it was a great point that larry nickles made he was going to be popping on the fourth hour today
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:06.640]  that bill clinton told him no thing he said bill clinton ever told him that was true he said
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:12.560]  that great men aren't just made as great men great circumstances make great men
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:17.040]  that's a paraphrase but that's exactly what's happening the new world thinks they're just
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:20.640]  going to move against everybody just going to win and we're all going to roll over that's not what's
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:26.000]  happening all right now we go to outside resident germany they'll give you the name of the hotel
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.760]  the details it's all up on info wars dot com we have the list of the bill berg meetings
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:33.840]  an article by paul watson paul is landing in germany right now but he has to drive several
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:39.520]  hours to get to him he'll be there uh later this evening reporting uh but bill berg 2016
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:45.120]  to talk trump riots migrants and bricks it these are the people that open the borders
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:49.760]  this is their global plan literally they're in there planning the end of europe right now
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:55.600]  and outside of that very hotel is rob do rob tell us exactly what's unfolded the last 24 hours
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:00.400]  thank you alex uh this is rob do reporting live from dresden germany right outside the
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:05.280]  kip nitsky hotel it's also called the grand hotel toshenberg palet you can see the name
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:11.200]  up on the back of the hotel and this is where bill berg 2016 will be taking place uh starting
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:16.000]  tomorrow at noon they're going to start kicking people out of this area and uh josh if you could
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.880]  pan around show people the uh security barrier that was erected today this was not here yesterday
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:26.720]  they started with the uh concrete pylons and then they put rod iron above them and alex i want to
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:33.680]  make note too of this josh keep it right there now alex right here is a giant triangle a pyramid
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:38.320]  with a circle in the middle representing the eye the all-seeing eye wow this is the same thing that
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:44.800]  we saw last year at the uh the interalpin hotel a giant pyramid so these people love symbology
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:51.200]  and this is part of it here at the uh toshenberg palet hotel where bill berg 2016 is going to be
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:55.280]  taken obviously you're going to follow a report on that that is that is sensational we have another
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:59.920]  report from john bowell on the same subject yesterday they are really throwing in our face
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:03.600]  they really are and it was funny as we were setting up a guy on a bike rode up to me he goes
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:08.560]  do you see the the triangle and the circle in the middle i said yeah we saw we as we walked outside
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:12.400]  we saw the same thing he goes he goes can you believe it can you believe it and then i said hey
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:16.240]  if you want to be uh you want to be on the video he goes no no no and he rode off but it's just
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:21.200]  people know what's going on we saw signs yesterday at the uh the march for the pergita the people were
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:25.120]  you know there's some bill berg signs out there and so people are aware of it i think
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:29.440]  there's going to be big protests now here's the breaking news alex this morning when we were walking
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:34.560]  through the hotel shooting video we i saw a group of people having a meeting and i didn't make much
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:39.360]  note of it but i did stop and shoot a little bit of it we filed that video turns out that was german
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:45.600]  military planning security with the hotel staff so now german military is involved in the security
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:50.080]  apparatus here for bill berg 2016 i haven't seen anything about that in the news so i believe
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:54.960]  we are taxpayers are having to pay for the overthrow of their own country exactly exactly
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:58.720]  and i think that's definitely because angela merkel is going to be here along with five of her
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:04.240]  ministers and the governor of saxony so they are are gearing up to make this there but what's
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:10.640]  being said now a group of seven or more is going to be illegal they will not have any group of seven
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:16.000]  or more anywhere around here and they they have a very small area compared to what happened yesterday
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:21.680]  or last year where it was uh five miles around the hotel you've got just this little bitty area
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:25.280]  here that they're that they've got cordoned off and they got a little bit cordoned off in the back
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:30.080]  but the big you know the big news is that i think the german military is now actively working
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:34.640]  with the governments and and everybody else to provide security here and i don't think that's
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:39.360]  ever been done i had that confirmed by a source who actually thought they were police and one of
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:43.600]  two of them started talking to them and they said no we're german military well it's amazing is
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:49.840]  they've they've always every fourth year been in virginia or other areas like georgia on the east
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:54.080]  coast but bill de berg has officially come out and said yes we're dresden germany they released
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:59.520]  this today it's up on drugsreport.com bill de berg meetings the official website now again just a
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:04.720]  decade ago they didn't have official website they would say it didn't exist we were insane now uh
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:09.120]  a few years ago in england they said oh the prime minister isn't going then here he comes you know by
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:14.880]  via helicopter uh and then accompanying motorcade of his security this is going on we're pointing
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:20.880]  out the secret meetings that are happening yeah they said they said the same thing with um with
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:25.840]  angela merkel she's not on the official list i checked it today but everybody's been saying
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:29.920]  she's going to be here so i definitely think she's going to be here especially with the migrant crisis
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:36.720]  going on and with all with the groundswell of people starting to get up and be pissed off because
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:41.600]  they're taxed too much the standard of living is going down uh they can't afford to have just a
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:45.760]  decent standard of living by working two or three jobs and people are pissed off and that and you're
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:49.760]  seeing that all around all around the world it's not just here in germany it's all over the world
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:54.720]  that people want to get out of the e you in england and so they were never allowed to even vote to
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:50:00.080]  be in it they were never allowed to vote to be in it and that was a plan fomented in bill de berg
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:04.240]  and i think it's funny we did that spoof video of hitler and the bunker planning bill de berg with
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:10.240]  his military officers and here we see military officers here planning the security so it's weird
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:16.960]  how how fiction becomes fact and art becomes life you know and we didn't know that at the time we just
[01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:20.240]  thought thought it'd be kind of funny to have you know we're coming to germany let's have hitler
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:24.240]  planning bill de berg that's that's that's spoof for folks that don't know this has been going on
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:28.160]  for 10 years since that bunker move came out in germany and everybody takes it and cuts it for
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:31.600]  political issues and the people said oh you're trying to demonize germans as if they're the
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:36.320]  source of tyranny no we're saying hitler's a dictatorial figure merkel's a dictatorial figure
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:43.840]  we're paralleling that the eu was a nazi project and so was bill de berg that's a fact that's in
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:49.520]  disputed okay exactly and people were wearing shirts they had signs yesterday of merkel dressed up
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:54.160]  as a nazi so it's not far from the truth but the media claims they're all nazis out that are
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:57.760]  protesting or no the truth is we couldn't find any of them inverting reality inverting reality
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:04.160]  yeah stay there rob does our guests we'll be back this is dan billard you owe the irish money you

[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:22.880]  why is it so important that we expose the bill to bergeron well patriot 60 years ago
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:29.600]  started warning of plans for a global government it was so mainstream that even eisenhower talked
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:33.280]  about it richard nixon then ronald reagan as governor and ronald reagan as a candidate
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:38.720]  in the late 1970s and he'd say i don't want george herbert walker bush on my ticket he's
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:43.360]  part of that trilateral commission and that builder bird we've got to actually have clips of that
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:50.240]  but then they would just demonize anybody that talked about it like it didn't exist
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:57.600]  and this is just one of the top shadowy room events but it's trilateral commission builder bird
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:00.560]  and then they have different round table groups that interface as well like the royal instead
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:04.320]  of international affairs and the council on farm relations but it's the same few hundred people
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:08.800]  and they are technocrats they are globalists they are eugenicists they are anti humans
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:14.560]  they are post industrialist and they'll control left right fascist muslim they don't care to get
[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:19.920]  their game plan and so we're forcing this out in the open it was about a decade ago that drudge
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:24.160]  report started linking to our articles covering boulderberg every year and media would go look
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:30.480]  at drudge linking to imaginary stuff it's not happening remember that so i don't mean to sycophantically
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:35.200]  plug drudge every day on a subject but we got to give credit where credit's good like general dempsi
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:40.800]  saying four years ago we're not going to be part of an attack
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:51.600]  on the syrians for al-qaeda and isis it's just not going to happen
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.440]  and that's what's going on is we're just finding our conscience and saying no
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:00.640]  and and they've always denied this stuff's going on we're forcing it out in the open
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:05.520]  to have a real discussion yes obama you're shipping illegals in and legalizing them
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:11.200]  and letting them have tb and putting them in school next to kids you're out of control oh no
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:15.840]  we're not no we're not yes you are here it isn't the associated press we're forcing the issue
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:19.200]  rob dude tell me what you found inside the hotel what else you're going to be covering

[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:05.840]  couldn't read it and I had a guy next to me so what does this say so well he's given a ticket
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:11.440]  for uh passing out flyers did you get a video of this this is sensational I do it's going up
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:15.280]  we're going to be we're going to have that out and um in fact we're going to go meet him again to
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:19.120]  talk more about it because he kind of left that as an aside on this short little video I'm like
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:22.320]  though this is big news you don't understand yeah they're just used to it they're just used to being
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:26.720]  given a ticket for him being stopped down but here's here's also something I want to talk about
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:30.800]  Alex Lindsey Graham is going to be here we have a sitting senator that's going to be at the
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:37.040]  builderberg meeting that's got to violate several laws uh oh Lindsey Graham loves you know what he
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:42.640]  on our face oh yeah yeah so it'll be interesting I hope I can ask him a question or two how does he
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:46.960]  feel about violating the Logan act uh is he going to be in charge of picking the male escorts for
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:50.640]  this year's builderberg you know there's a lot of questions I have for Lindsey Graham and why he's
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:56.080]  even here he's probably here to help uh steamroll our submarine trumps uh candidacy I think I think
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:02:59.840]  that's the main reason they're going to come up with an anti-trump plan they've got a lot of uh
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:03.360]  big backers they always had the big money guys showing up here all these financial guys Vernon
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:07.680]  Jordan is going to be here James Johnson so I'm sure they're going to be co-ulating a plan
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:11.600]  to get rid of the Trump president and you know what else is on it if we have sources connected
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:16.960]  to the inside getting that internet ID is their number one deal cashless society get ready for
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:21.040]  that they're gonna have Zuckerberg trying to quarterback that uh Zuckerberg goes to the
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:25.680]  meetings as well I haven't seen him the whole list yet just came out is Zuckerberg on the list this
[02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:30.640]  year I didn't see him but Eric Schmidt is here Peter Teal and the head of LinkedIn I forget his
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:37.040]  name uh right off the top of my head but he's also here Sean Parker uh well I don't I don't
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:42.240]  think that's his name I don't recognize him now the head of LinkedIn uh who which is the uh business
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:47.680]  network they just put Sean Parker on screen they just put Sean Parker on spring okay yeah
[02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:51.280]  and uh so it'll be interesting to see who shows up we'll be here tomorrow we're gonna have people
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:56.960]  also at the airport waiting to see who who pops in so it's it's gonna get start getting lively
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:01.520]  tomorrow here in Dresden Germany and who knows what it's gonna be like now that the military
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:05.840]  is coming into run security because these guys don't play games and what I heard last year
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:10.560]  is if you think the Austrian military is bad wait till you deal with the Germans because they're
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:15.440]  10 times worse so we're gonna find out in the next few days of what's gonna go on here in Dresden
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:20.480]  Germany yeah well these are imperious traders when they try to violate Germans free speech
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:24.560]  this is what Hitler did and if the Germans don't recognize how much trouble they're in
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:29.760]  they're crazy they do though the French have headlines in AFP like French scared as
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:35.200]  shroud of tyranny lowers free speech banned civil emergency you know for the darling little
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:39.600]  Muslims that are being brought in it's all happening and people need to get out here if
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:43.440]  you're living anywhere in Germany get out here now I've got a guest coming on for about 40 minutes
[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:46.800]  that I'm airing a special Jim Kennedy interview that's four minutes long but if you'd like to
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:50.640]  pop in right at the end of the show if something else has developed do that if not go get all those

[02:04:56.880 --> 02:05:03.200]  any wz you can find me there and there you go stay there I want to talk to Hilary Clinton has no
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:09.040]  shortage of celebrity endorsements including actress Eva Longoria snoop d o double g and
[02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:14.640]  kim Kardashian now she's gaining support from an unlikely source for a very bizarre reason
[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:20.480]  Scott Adams the creator of the long-lived comic strip series Dilbert is endorsing Hilary out of
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:26.880]  fear for his personal safety despite never having endorsed Donald Trump Adam says he's already been
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:32.080]  on the receiving end of criticism from Hilary supporters labeling him a Trump apologist

[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:40.720]  we have seen five million muslims most of the military age men brought in from war torn zones
[02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:47.520]  where saudi arabia in the last five years has funded a multi-million person invasion of syria
[02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:54.320]  most of them women and children as camp followers like the huns behind the men killing even their
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:09:01.280]  fellow sunnis and shiites and christians every several thousand allowed in almost all of them
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:08.640]  are wahhabist you might have one christian it's what 0.7 percent and obama tells jokes and says
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:14.480]  we got to let everybody in not just the christians when he knows that well syria was over 20 christian
[02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:19.120]  not now they've killed hundreds of thousands of them i'm somebody that was against all these wars
[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:22.880]  in the middle east because i knew it was part of a plan to destabilize it now the bilberberg group
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:27.120]  and globalist groups have funded the arab spring why is merkel bringing in millions of these people
[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:33.280]  why is halan why are the leaders of sweden we have our reporters in germany right now
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:38.640]  filing a video report where citizens out handing out flyers it marches the german government has
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:46.080]  said is illegal saying don't open our borders to these people writing them tickets for handing out
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:52.720]  literature why are our governments doing this now our guests folks have wanted a month for years
[02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:58.880]  i don't know why it's taken so long as i've read several of his books dr bill warner has been a
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:04.000]  physicist a businessman and professor and i'm not going to go over his whole the background but he
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:08.880]  is now the director of the center for the study of political islam and i've read some of his books
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:14.080]  seen some of his talks it's dead on from just my mainline study of history but it's not well known
[02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:17.920]  by the public now he could go through a whole history treat us with us you can go to his website
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:22.960]  and do that or read his books but i'd like to just get the short and skinny of it why he thinks the
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:28.400]  elite is doing this are doing this where it's going who's really in control of islam right now
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:34.320]  why would our elites ally with the most radical form out of saudi arabia the wahabi uh uh yosuni
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:41.280]  group and how do we counter this and respond to it why is the left so in love with it i mean you
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:48.480]  get some college student might have raped a woman six months isn't enough okay fine but then you got
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:52.400]  muslims murdering their wives here in the us and they get light sentences because oh it's their
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:58.800]  culture what's going on why is the establishment so in love with it shows there's a long history of it
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:04.000]  but he argues there was no golden age like lord montan says there was some times when islam
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:09.280]  you know was less destructive than some of the stuff in medieval europe regardless it's destructive
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:15.760]  now and radical islam used the new islam or was the old islam and is dominating islam so i think
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:21.120]  the debate is over so what is the establishment going to do when there's more terror attacks in
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:26.160]  europe in the west but we know they're going to take our liberties saying it's our fault that the
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:33.280]  muslims attacked us and so he joins us now via video skype political islam dot com thank you
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:41.120]  for joining us uh dr warner glad to be here okay we got about 30 40 minutes here uh try to educate
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:47.520]  folks try to educate myself give us the dr bill warner boil down well first off everything that
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:54.000]  islam does is supremely logical if you understand their logic and their logic is laid out in the
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:12:01.840]  quran and it's laid out also in the words of muhammad and once you understand who muhammad is and
[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:07.600]  who a lot is everything makes sense the reason it's so confusing is you see there's two different
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:14.320]  muhammad's and two different quran's so islam is based on dualism it's always got a nice peaceful
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:20.800]  side and a jihad side and this is due to the very nature of who muhammad was i give you a real
[02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:27.280]  brief summary of his life he preached the religion of for 15 years 13 years in mackam converted 150
[02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:33.200]  Arabs to islam they drove him out of mackam because he brought him to sentient sound familiar and he
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:38.960]  went to medina where he became a jihadist and a politician he had 100 acts of jihad in the last
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:46.000]  nine years was like not 101 not 99 but 100 but when he died every muslim every arab was a muslim
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:52.800]  so here what do we have we have a peaceful preacher muhammad and then we have a vicious jihadist
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:56.880]  but who was successful it was the jihad that was successful there was the politics that was
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:03.600]  successful so this dualistic nature of muhammad is reflected in the quran and so this is why you
[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:08.880]  hear people say oh no islam is the religion of peace well yes it is but it's the politics
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:14.800]  of jihad so this dualism allows islam to always come off exactly how it needs to be
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:20.480]  nice for the nice people and not nice for the not nice people so that's sort of the the doctrine
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:29.200]  is at the basis of the confusion fundamentally deceptive break it down for us more yes as a
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:36.400]  matter of fact there are many uh hadith which advocate deception who will kill ashraf who
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:41.360]  was offended along his prophet this is a hadith i will muhammad but i will need to deceive him i
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:48.000]  do so yes deceive him and these are the words of muhammad so these are doctrinal words there are
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:53.040]  12 verses in the quran which say that a muslim is never the true friend of a kafir i'm a kafir
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:14:00.160]  and i suspect you are too so here we have you can be friendly but you're not actually a friend so
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:04.960]  this is once again the threat of deception but it also explains why we see that we have vicious
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:09.920]  jihadist and then we have a med who works out the fruit market is a nice kind of guy which
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:20.880]  one's the real muslim yes they're both real muslims you've got the floor okay so now why is all this
[02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:26.800]  so hard to understand because what has happened is is that our intellectual class the universities
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:32.480]  have decided to abandon reason and instead become politically correct one of the greatest tragedies
[02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:37.200]  we have in our culture today is the fact that well i'm giving an example i gave a talk in north
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:43.600]  carolina and a president of a local community college said this man is unbalanced maybe but he
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:48.720]  should never be allowed to speak what do we have here we have the president of a college saying that
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:54.480]  ideas should not be debated but instead should just be suppressed so this is what our root
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:59.200]  problem is is we're giving up what is the cornerstone of our civilization which is critical thought
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:04.160]  i mean alex once we throw our critical thought out and we have nothing in the world but ideological
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:09.760]  propaganda we're already in the sluice it's uh so our big problem is is we've given up
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:17.600]  rational thought but my guess this is no news to you and all over the world they are banning
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:22.720]  so-called liberal democracies like germany even criticizing open borders are saying mild things
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:30.400]  about controlling so at a certain point i agree that the politically correct or ignorant at the
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:36.240]  grassroots level but above it there's a more sinister plan well i think that power everyone
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:44.960]  loves power and the the left has certainly taken over the universities and also the media but now
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:49.360]  you know i don't just blame the left for taking over i also blame the conservatives for having
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:54.800]  given up i live in national tennessee which is a very religious town and fairly conservative
[02:15:54.800 --> 02:16:01.680]  although not as much as the surrounding states and there's no real cry for the ending of censorship
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:07.360]  that is the conservatives are not raising enough hell alex just put it blindly nor are the christians
[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:13.760]  we're all being a little too nice the cancer of nice is killing us man well you look at the
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:19.760]  peenak documents that are from so-called conservatives and dick cheney and others write
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:23.680]  about we need a big pearl harvard event catalyzing event that then we can go in and basically have
[02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:29.040]  a clash of civilizations and control the grand chess board that's actually a big the brzezinski
[02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:35.200]  idea of occupying the middle east not to reform it but to then control the crossroads of europe
[02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:39.920]  and asia and control russia and china but regardless they've only started up and are now
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:45.840]  ally with the more radical elements how does saudi arabia feed into all this interesting
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:53.280]  question let me give you an example you've heard of chechnya yes well the chechnya is uh
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:58.720]  jihadists are the most vicious they're the supreme jihadists now then you need to understand
[02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:06.000]  that chechnya used to be a sufi based kind of islam that is singing dancing uh sort of the loving
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:13.840]  side of islam well islam came in in the form of wahhabism with islamic money in particular
[02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:20.400]  saudi money and now then the chechens have become vicious jihadists the effect is this effect is
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:27.280]  being seen in places like malaysia or saudi arabia used to be moved into in malaysia you had a hindu
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:32.080]  form of islam that is there was a hindu culture there and the islam and not penetrated down to
[02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:38.160]  destroy all the hinduism but now then with wahhabi money coming in will be we see now in arabia i
[02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:44.480]  mean i'm sorry malaysia the rise of a more vicious kind of islam so what is happening is is that the
[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:50.800]  wahhabis in saudi arabia have infinite sums of money you must surely know that saudi arabia
[02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:55.760]  spending more money to islamicize the world 80 percent of the mosfian america are built by the
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:18:02.800]  saudi then it was so the union did at the height of the cold war so we're in a war with a militarized
[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:10.480]  system that uses a religion as its cult control system and it is proselytizing and radicalizing
[02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:15.360]  all their forms of islam around the world and successfully taking over all the way down into
[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:20.480]  central africa and western africa and eastern africa all the way as far east as indonesia
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:26.800]  uh i mean this this is massive with our own governments bring them in and mash oh well i
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:31.600]  don't think our government is resisting islam anything at all as a person who speaks to the
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:36.560]  subject of islam let me tell you what happens to those who do i'm called a racist a bigot a
[02:18:36.560 --> 02:18:41.280]  hater in islamophone you're probably called the same thing what's interesting about this verbiage
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:45.360]  is is it never says when a bill you know when you say there's two different muhammad's a religious
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:51.120]  preacher and a violent jihadist you're wrong no no no they say that i am a bad person because i
[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:56.320]  bring these facts up so once again we've lost the ability to reason together you're not supposed
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:19:02.480]  to quote muhammad who within you know his life took over an entire region and then within 100
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:07.120]  years of his death i mean let's go over some of the history when we come back from break here
[02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:12.080]  of the expansion of islam because we hear this religion apiece the pope has come out and said
[02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:17.120]  that he's very troubled about saying europe's christian uh that he what's the word abhors it well
[02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:23.920]  what's the exact word he dreads the christian nature of europe i mean wow you know is the new
[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:32.320]  pope is is he actually an ambassador uh of uh solid arabia now well i'm afraid uh the pope
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:36.800]  does not seem to demonstrate any knowledge of islam he may have some but he certainly doesn't
[02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:41.840]  demonstrate it he just attended a meeting with a grand iman kamal azar university and the two of them
[02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:45.920]  came out with we're gonna have we're gonna give peace a chance you could just hear john lennon
[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:50.880]  in the background and that the true nature of islam has it's all about peace and so they're gonna
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:57.440]  was islam that destroyed the last christian seat of the old world in konstantinople folks may

[02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:21.600]  islam today map of the world or you can also look at a group of maps you islam over time and it's
[02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:28.880]  spread and europe almost collapsed but when you go to college you're taught that europe invaded
[02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:33.600]  and there's all these movies made by hollywood where europe invaded the middle east for no reason
[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:37.840]  they were bad and they were horrible look europe did all sorts of barbarous stuff but this is the
[02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:42.240]  place where the renaissance came from everybody wants to come here because we created the modern
[02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:49.120]  world and i see it as a form of cuckolding or suicide of the west to just bring in the most
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:53.280]  radical of these people and then say we have to submit to them we're talking to dr bill
[02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:58.000]  warner of political islam.com holly requested obviously and i've read some of his books seen
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:02.720]  his work it's all spot on from my research but he just lays it all out and gets demonized for it
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:08.160]  this is a fact so let's talk about the history of it some sir this is a short segment long segment
[02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:15.840]  coming up the boil down of how it's expanded and and where you see it going well the expansion
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:20.880]  started with muhammad remember he was in mecca then he went to medina this movement from mecca
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:27.840]  to medina is called the hijra that is the migration the islamic calendar is based upon the hijra
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:35.200]  why because it was migration that brought islam its success now fast forward 1400 years and what's
[02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:40.320]  happening in europe we have a new hijra we have a new migration and it's important to know that
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:46.320]  hijra is a form of jihad now then i don't doubt but what there's some of these so-called quote
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:52.320]  syrian refugees who are actually economic migrants and they're not jihadist but nevertheless we do
[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:58.640]  have to understand that islam has a doctrine of jihad that is based upon migration and as soon as
[02:25:58.640 --> 02:26:04.320]  muhammad died islam started bursting out of the middle east took over the middle east and let's
[02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:09.440]  let's stop right here and deal with the question the crusades as we're taught in the west is they
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:16.480]  were an evil act by evil christians who are going to invade the pure land of islam the middle east
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:25.120]  and do bad things hello the four muhammad the middle east was christian it was islam that
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:32.160]  invaded the christian lands of the middle east not the european knights of the crusades so i
[02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:36.880]  somehow know that we've managed to get all this history turned inside out but it was the case
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:42.960]  that the crusades were a defensive move trying to reclaim the middle east for christians now it
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:49.120]  succeeded only a part but nevertheless its intent was reestablishing what was originally there in
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:56.000]  the middle east anyway which was a christian nation or a series of nations i mean iraq used to be
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:02.000]  christian north africa was christian egypt was christian turkey was christian even persia was half
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:09.200]  christian but this is all gone under the jihad and the migration of islam so i think we need to
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:14.720]  reacquaint ourselves with our history and when i say our history i'm saying that the history of
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:19.280]  europe is also the same as the history of the united states and even in a strange way the history of
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:25.120]  japan and others because i'm talking about a meta civilization here not just a european civilization
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:30.560]  but a civilization based on two critical points one the ethical principle of the golden rule our
[02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:36.240]  unitary ethics and the second is the intellectual principle of critical thought because that's
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:41.280]  what our civilization is based on and it's not just ours but others it's important to know that
[02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:47.120]  islam denies the golden rule because it doesn't have one it creates kafers and and muslims which
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:54.720]  is not a unified beauty of humanity so these are all some elements of history which unfortunately
[02:27:54.720 --> 02:28:04.240]  seem to be lost upon our current scholars in the universities and of course we have this whole
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:09.760]  well hobbyist system that was one of the most radical forms ever that from my research went
[02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:14.960]  wrong was basically based on the slave trade and robbing caravans and that somehow got linked
[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:19.680]  up with british intelligence in 1900 they gave it funding to make that the brand of islam around
[02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:25.440]  the middle east what an insane program and by the way let me challenge you on the use of one word
[02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:30.480]  here the wild hobbies are not extremist or radical they are the original then you're saying they're
[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:35.920]  the real deal oh no they're the real deal they're the 24 carat the same way the islamic state so
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:42.000]  i'm using a politically correct term when i say radical islam the truth is bonafide original jihad
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:50.640]  islam died in the wall died in the world yeah orthodox exactly islamic state is pure orthodoxy
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:56.480]  the wahhabis are pure orthodoxy everything they do and say look islamic state goes through a lot
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:01.680]  of trouble i read their material they go through a lot of trouble to justify what they do for instance
[02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:07.280]  they were criticized for taking sex slaves islamic state says hey look at the data look at the
[02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:12.400]  information mohammed had sex slaves all the companions of mohammed except for one had sex
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:18.000]  slaves the quran gives the right for sex slaves so don't criticize us for being bad and awesome
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:23.680]  and then the left worships them i do the left is not the left they're mentally ill demons
[02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:32.560]  you know it's really odd i support equal rights for women and attack the sharia attack on women's
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:38.800]  rights and yet because i support the the quality of women and oppose the sharia view of women
[02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:43.520]  i'm called a big and i hate it absolutely absolutely if you don't support generally mutilating
[02:29:43.520 --> 02:29:47.520]  women and putting bags over their heads and keeping them as slaves and kidnapping five-year-old girls
[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:53.520]  and transshipping them to be in snuff films you're a bad person we're on the march the empires on the

[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:29.920]  list shows a total of 426 organizations far higher than what the treasury department's
[02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:36.320]  inspector general believed there to be back in may 2013 when he identified nearly 300 groups
[02:30:36.320 --> 02:30:41.440]  the names span the gamut covering well-known groups like the tea party patriots but also
[02:30:41.440 --> 02:30:47.360]  lower-profile locals like the louisiana campaign for liberty patriots of charleston the ashville

[02:33:36.560 --> 02:33:42.000]  bill berg 2016 in dresden germany the admitted founder of the e you as a bill berg group member
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:48.400]  peter southern he's the head of the e you and you in migration and borders committees both of them
[02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:52.960]  and he's openly told the bbc and others we want to get rid of the whiteness of europe it's inherently
[02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:59.600]  bad well if you should get rid of the blackness of africa that'd be in inherently racist but it's
[02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:03.600]  beyond that the globalists aren't planning to get rid of everybody in the west they're planning to
[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:08.320]  just bring in incredible tyranny but to do that first they've got to bring in huge incompatible
[02:34:08.320 --> 02:34:14.240]  groups and then we're all told come apply with them or the muslims will blow you up and i said
[02:34:14.240 --> 02:34:18.400]  clearly that's where this is going a few years ago now they're actually in the news saying
[02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:22.240]  we can't allow germans to march and say control our borders because that might make the immigrants
[02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:27.840]  upset see not because they care about the immigrants they're playing everyone off against
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:33.200]  each other and the globalists are so authoritarian and have deals with saudi arabia now they think
[02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:38.880]  this is controllable they're on power trips they're delusional or maybe they don't care if we all
[02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:43.920]  fall to radical islam which is dominant orthodox islam in 50 years i just know this i have two
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:48.240]  daughters and i have been at the domain in north austin now even have photos of what were new reports
[02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:54.160]  and i just had a i just talked about it had the memory and i got physically physically nauseous
[02:34:55.280 --> 02:35:00.960]  and and i was at barton creek mall i don't go to the mall very often and i'm telling you i guess
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:05.040]  that's the culture to be in the markets at night or whatever it was every turn was women with full
[02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:13.760]  outfits on full heads covered up the barcas not just the hajibs and these women are born into
[02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:18.160]  slavery these women are some of them are under stockholm syndrome i mean they go along with it
[02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:24.800]  it'll defend it and teach their kids to blow themselves up but austin you're downtown folks it
[02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:30.880]  is crawling with muslims in their full gear and in the first waves they're all pro-west westernized
[02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:34.960]  all this not now finishing up with our guests i want to invite back for a full hour uh in the
[02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:40.080]  near future i really appreciate uh the doctor coming on with us his website everybody should
[02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:44.960]  check out his political islam dot com dr bill warner summing this up the next five six minutes
[02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:49.520]  is anything i'm saying wrong on those fronts where is it going where do you see an ending i mean
[02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:56.480]  europe is pre-meditatedly doing this why by the way i was recently in uh well as a year or so ago
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:04.000]  was in uh mastodonia and uh i was throughout the entire balkans which was a really uh educational
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:09.600]  trip and when i was in mastodonia i saw all these new mosques being built and they're being built
[02:36:09.600 --> 02:36:15.280]  by the turks the neil ottomans the turks have moved in and set up schools now one of the things
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:20.560]  they will do at these schools is is if you as a mastodonian will become a muslim and wear the
[02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:28.080]  guard they will pay you each month a salary for wearing islamic guard this is a form of
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:33.760]  civilizational war which is brilliant that's right that's why msnb cnn bombs you with women in
[02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:40.000]  hajibs on tv bombs you with how liberal and the liberal magazines now even women that the top liberals
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:46.160]  wear it i could be a sex slave too exactly uh so that's it this is to throw it in our face
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:53.440]  by the way the name of your show is the war we should be fighting this war of bullets and bombs
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:59.520]  that bush did and that obama's done that is not how to defeat islam this is an information war
[02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:04.080]  this is a war of ideas not bullets and bombs yes sir and i'm sorry for interrupting get back into
[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:08.800]  that in a moment but you're just you're absolutely on target they're flaunting it flaunting it i've
[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:13.920]  been in london just filming a public building and muslims run over you don't feel me like i mean
[02:37:13.920 --> 02:37:22.480]  they're very aggressive so so so go back to this war this what they're doing well the word jihad
[02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:28.560]  is not well understood it doesn't mean it does not mean holy war there are four kinds of jihad
[02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:34.720]  there's the jihad of the sword that's like on 9 11 that's violence murder and killing then there's
[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:42.320]  jihad of speech jihad of writing and ah the jihad of money the jihad of war is not our problem
[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:48.160]  the jihad of uh murder we can deal with that we have professional cops we have protection
[02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:53.680]  professional soldiers the war that's killing us alex is the word is the war of speech and writing
[02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:59.840]  it is the war of ideas because what we're doing now is we're saying that if you have the right ideas
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:05.440]  then you can be condemned as being a racist haters clearly we're losing the war to orthodox islam
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:11.600]  we're losing the info war yes exactly and why are we losing the info war because the people who
[02:38:11.600 --> 02:38:15.600]  should be fighting this information war let me bring up i live in national tennessee which is a
[02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:22.000]  very religious town you would think that the ministers in the churches would be all for bringing
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:27.680]  in christians who are persecuted in africa and middle east but no what do they do they say oh we
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:31.760]  need the syrian refugees we'll show how much we love them we're going to cure this whole problem
[02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:36.720]  with law so here we have ministers who don't know the crusades from anything else telling us how to
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:44.800]  deal with islam again i do not blame the muslims and islam for winning i blame us for losing
[02:38:44.800 --> 02:38:49.520]  you understand that's the different viewpoint i have here yes sir dr and let me be clear i'm
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:54.160]  somebody that a lot of the muslims and countless emails and phone calls going he used to be our
[02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:59.840]  friend you know five ten years ago you exposed so much and now you're against this i'm not against
[02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:04.720]  anybody but clearly i didn't want to have the clash of civilizations i didn't want to destabilize
[02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:10.320]  those regions i didn't want to fund saudi arabia pushing orthodox islam that that goes after everybody
[02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:15.600]  else well you know like their heretics and kills them or enslaves them i'm a friend of humans but
[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:21.120]  when my governments are allied with a bunch of radicals that turn women into slaves and then
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:25.360]  they're telling me i've got to give up my speech that's it see i'm into everybody having the rights
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:31.520]  i'm americana i'm an orthodox americana 1776er i'm a classical true liberal in the vein of thomas
[02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:36.720]  jefferson and when people come after my freedoms it's over and so don't worry doc you've been
[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:42.080]  helping win the info war or start some beach ads and now the info war is on the job so we're we see
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:45.760]  what you're saying you're dead on we're taking action and and i think more people are starting
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:51.840]  to wake up to this too aren't they tell you why i use very i do very little work on the internet
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:56.320]  i'm an old man i'm 75 years old i read books you may have been familiar with books in your
[02:39:56.320 --> 02:40:01.600]  past yes sir but my wife has taught me how to read on the internet she's my researcher i basically
[02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:07.920]  live with an intelligence officer she said bill scan the article read the comments and what has
[02:40:07.920 --> 02:40:14.000]  happened alex in the since 9 11 is that we when i say we the knowledgeable those who actually know
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:19.280]  something about islam are beginning to dominate the comments our leaders are more corrupt and
[02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:23.920]  represent us less and less every day but the grassroots let me assure you is beginning to
[02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:28.960]  wake up all you have to do is read the comments it used to be the word like hadith or sunnah
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:34.480]  were never heard in the comments now then it isn't it's very common for people to quote islamic
[02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:41.200]  doctrine doctrine about the hijra doctrine about jihad doctrine about everything so we are winning
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:46.320]  at the grassroots level where we're losing is at the top that's right but the but the globalists
[02:40:46.320 --> 02:40:50.080]  know what when you start winning long term on the ground that ends up going to the top of the
[02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:53.840]  pyramid later that's why they're coming in with all these pushes for censorship is because they
[02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:59.360]  know we're turning the tide and by the way alex out of all the things in the bill of rights the
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:04.400]  most important is freedom of speech that's right because once you lose freedom of speech all those
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:10.640]  others about religion press and sharia law is directly wrong dynamically oppose the first
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:16.000]  amendment because it says congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:20.560]  approving the first the rise thereof that's the first line under sharia law it is state-run
[02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:27.040]  religion you got it you know one of the biggest one of the things when i first started learning
[02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:32.000]  about islam was listening to islamic leaders and they would say jaw-dropping things never like
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:36.560]  you gotta be kidding me right but one of remember the man who wanted to build the mosques where the
[02:41:36.560 --> 02:41:43.200]  world trade towers went on he said the sharia and the constitution are are exactly the same document
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:48.400]  while the sharia is just an earlier form of the united states constitution you look at him you go
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:54.960]  what because nothing could be more contrary to our constitution than sharia law sharia law says
[02:41:54.960 --> 02:42:00.000]  that women are not equal to men sharia law by the way also goes ahead to say that Muslims can have
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:07.600]  weapons but not kafers not unbelievers so the by the way speaking of kafers let's talk about islam
[02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:12.480]  a little bit and its view of black people because i don't know why so many black folks worship islam
[02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:17.840]  Muhammad Ali you name it when there's some stuff i don't want to repeat in the muslim documents
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:25.520]  one of the great ironies is Muhammad Ali coming out and becoming a muslim do you remember what
[02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:33.040]  his original name was it was casius clay you knew casius clay was an abolitionist a white abolitionist
[02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:39.120]  who wanted to get rid of slavery and so he adopts the name Muhammad and Ali Muhammad was a slave
[02:42:39.120 --> 02:42:45.280]  holder Muhammad was a slave trader he tortured slaves he had sex slaves he captured people
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:50.800]  and made them slaves the every black man who came to america came through the hands of a muslim
[02:42:50.800 --> 02:42:55.760]  trader in africa so here we have Muhammad Ali who's now being praised as a really nice guy
[02:42:56.320 --> 02:43:02.960]  but he did a very his leadership was for the black community was disastrous because he wanted to say
[02:43:02.960 --> 02:43:09.200]  to them oh christianity is the religion of a white man islam is the religion of the black man
[02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:14.560]  hello are you setting down alex because i'm getting ready to tell you something Muhammad was called a
[02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:20.080]  white man in the hadith which one is Muhammad the white man leaning on his elbow i saw the
[02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:26.560]  whiteness of Muhammad's belly on the day with the battle of the trench the hadith goes outside of its
[02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:32.880]  way to make sure to name the race of slaves and that Muhammad was white so here we have
[02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:39.200]  quote Muhammad Ali bringing freedom to the black man in europe by saying no we need to adopt the
[02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:45.200]  owner we need to adopt the names of slave owners Muhammad and Ali Ali was Muhammad's uh second
[02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:54.320]  cousin of brother-in-law no i got that wrong son in law and he was also a slave holder so here we
[02:43:54.320 --> 02:44:01.040]  have poor Muhammad Ali thinking he's doing black folks a favor when instead he's sealing with silence
[02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:07.600]  the fact that every a Muhammad Ali's ancestors cast his clays ancestors came through the hands
[02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:13.360]  of an arab slave trader in africa so i've forgotten that i've forgotten the cash his
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:17.920]  clay was a famous abolitionist that's true imagine get rid of the name of a christian abolitionist
[02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:24.720]  and somebody which died trying to free black people and then you go name yourself after two
[02:44:24.720 --> 02:44:33.920]  different slave owners slave traders we have on two different occasions Muhammad standing by while
[02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:37.840]  well no i know that's what went on in that part of the middle east that's that's that's historical
[02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:44.880]  that's that's in the karan i just can't that's what i mean i just they've had these leftist tv shows
[02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:50.320]  and movies made about me where they just randomly have actors act like they're me or have other
[02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:56.400]  actors say i got my news from alex jones a homophobe that hates inwards and and who hates all the
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:01.360]  muslims and it's just like weird leftist yeah what's that guy's name that did mr show and all
[02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:06.080]  at the big comedian and it's just funny to them to just put these lies out about us when i would
[02:45:06.080 --> 02:45:10.400]  everybody to be free i don't want anybody to be slave i don't hate anybody by the way let's deal
[02:45:10.400 --> 02:45:16.000]  with something here i'd if you're listening to me now i have dealt with one muslim cash his clay
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:22.880]  Muhammad Ali but i do not criticize him other than to say he's misled what i talk about is Islam
[02:45:22.880 --> 02:45:26.880]  i do very little or almost no talking about muslims that's right we're not demonizing the
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:31.120]  individuals we're demonizing what they claim to have an allegiance to and by the way what did
[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:38.400]  i say about Muhammad Ali he was misled he was fooled he was deceived so we need to deal with
[02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:44.240]  the subject of Islam Islam is the doctrine found in the Quran the seer on the hadith it's in three
[02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:49.120]  books it's Allah and Muhammad unless you're dealing with Allah and Muhammad you're not dealing with
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:55.600]  Islam and so we do not need to bash muslims one of the ironic things is i'm called a muslim basher
[02:45:55.600 --> 02:46:01.520]  and it's like no i don't i just tell you what Muhammad did and said i do not even bash Muhammad
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:06.400]  i simply say here's what he did here's what he said when i told you that story about Muhammad
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:12.640]  advising deceit i didn't say that Muhammad was a bad man for doing that i just said he said deceive
[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:19.280]  him so we don't need to bash people at all as indeed the first victim of Islam is the muslim
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:23.920]  and by the way i've met many muslims who know almost nothing about Islam
[02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:28.560]  oh of course listen i i mean i'll say it i just because the muslim friends i had in high school
[02:46:28.560 --> 02:46:34.560]  in college i was prejudiced almost towards not telling the truth because i thought these
[02:46:34.560 --> 02:46:38.160]  were such nice people this couldn't be possible well those are the doctors and the scientists
[02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:43.360]  and a lot of merheritics i'd say not in their own minds you know that tried to get away from
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:48.080]  Islam and be free i mean a lot of these books aren't like secret jihadi sneaking in climbing
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:53.360]  over the barbwire to get us but now you go to these poor back you know trodden falling apart
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:58.400]  muslim countries and they're bringing them in from here these folks just like you go into
[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:02.960]  poor areas of the south that's when you find all the trashy stupid clans people that's the same
[02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:08.960]  thing you get around you get these really trashy anti-human anti-woman orthodox muslims and they
[02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:13.600]  are just like from another planet we interviewed one in germany yesterday my crew did he goes
[02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:19.280]  i hate germany i hate these people but everything's free and i'm staying i'm jihadi and he's just this
[02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:25.440]  arrogant like out of the open i'm gonna get you guy they're just so uh some of them are so honest
[02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:30.800]  about it well actually they are quite honest about it because they know this they're not
[02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:35.680]  going to be attacked or harmed that is they can say all these things and still pick up their welfare
[02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:41.280]  check so now they've they've learned that they can do and say anything they want to do and they'll
[02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:47.200]  get a free pass on it well sir i want to invite you back up in your future for a full hour to
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:52.080]  send me an email with talking points i don't normally do this with with a lot of guests but
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:56.160]  so we kind of do an educational presentation with some slides some of your books your materials
[02:47:56.160 --> 02:48:02.000]  and then do a whole hour where we go through say a to b and c to all the way to z and because we're
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:08.320]  also tv not just radio so we can create an educational video uh on the 101 of what's happening
[02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:13.280]  and is this a culture you want to live under because orthodox islam is always running around
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:18.080]  enslaving other muslims and killing them to make them become more hardcore and more extreme
[02:48:18.080 --> 02:48:21.040]  and so if you want to live under a bullying system where your wife and daughter can't
[02:48:21.040 --> 02:48:26.480]  drive cars where their genitals are cut off and where uh women are executed if their husbands feel
[02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:30.480]  like it uh then you probably want to support gloria steinem because she supports these people
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:37.520]  and by the way the even in islamic state who is vis who's the most viciously attacked kafers
[02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:43.600]  no the ones that are mostly killed are bad quality muslims their shia or there's someone
[02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:48.640]  who's not observing look at this headline every day at 17 this day 200 something that day the
[02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:54.800]  latest 200 plus women have their heads cut off on video muslim women because they refuse to become
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:49:00.240]  sex slaves they have to make them quote agree to it because they weren't good muslims we'll put
[02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:08.800]  that on screen i mean what type of freakazoid garbage is this well one of the things here's
[02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:13.200]  the mark of a professional alex and i think you've just demonstrated the point you can't make this
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:19.200]  stuff up that's that that means you're a professional when you study islam is that and this is serious
[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:25.920]  everyone knows a lot about islam like the fact you just quoted is like what what how can you
[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:34.240]  make this up and you can't 250 women and that's just the one they pulled up from uh a few months
[02:49:34.240 --> 02:49:38.640]  ago there's another one today here in my stack somewhere and then this was little little girls
[02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:43.840]  they were killing but i mean i read some story where a hundred plus men raped a six-year-old
[02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:53.040]  till she died what type of whacked out loon people are these i mean they're crazy well i don't uh
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:50:00.960]  uh that kind of suffering it just disturbs me but what also disturbs me is we're the feminist on
[02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:05.760]  this issue i want to know they talk about a glass ceiling they're busy attacking you
[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:12.800]  what they're busy attacking you and i i guess they are but look the suffering of women in the
[02:50:12.800 --> 02:50:17.520]  middle east under islam needs to be dealt with fairly and if you're a real feminist i think you
[02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:23.120]  would care for somebody who's being brutally painfully tortured even if they're not a member of
[02:50:23.120 --> 02:50:30.560]  america so i mean look i'm for women's rights for all women and that's one of the objections i have
[02:50:30.560 --> 02:50:34.960]  to absolutely well listen doctor look forward to speaking to you again political islam dot com
[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:39.680]  dr bill warner i take the gloves off for any form of tyranny whether it be the new world order
[02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:45.520]  communism uh orthodox islam that is taking over whatever's left of islam and it's it's it's just
[02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:51.200]  all a plague on the solid shows our ruling controllers are evil absolute trash or they're
[02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:56.560]  the most inept morons the planet's ever seen thank you doctor thank you bye bye you'll be back

[02:55:35.280 --> 02:55:42.000]  but let's go ahead and go to this powerful report with tim kennedy
[02:55:44.320 --> 02:55:50.880]  i believe in dangerous freedom i'll take dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery any day
[02:55:51.600 --> 02:55:58.800]  the reason that i believe that is any other form of of this construct of freedom
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:06.800]  can't materialize it can't it can't ever be substantial without risk you know the part about
[02:56:06.800 --> 02:56:11.600]  being a libertarian the part about being an understanding what individual responsibility
[02:56:11.600 --> 02:56:19.040]  means there is some assumed risk that goes along with it that's knowing that the government can't
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:22.320]  take care of me all the time that's knowing that the government's not going to give me a free cell
[02:56:22.320 --> 02:56:26.320]  phone that's knowing that the government is not going to give me food when i'm hungry that's knowing
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:33.040]  that i have to take care of myself and my family i believe in freedom i believe that i should be able
[02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:41.200]  to say whatever i want whenever i want when it doesn't hurt somebody else i believe in freedom
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:45.760]  of religion i believe that there should be procedures when the government's going to come
[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:52.240]  and search my home or when i get in my car there's a reason that we had all these you know the
[02:56:52.240 --> 02:56:57.040]  constitution and every one of those wonderful amendments the only way that every single one of
[02:56:57.040 --> 02:57:05.520]  them can exist is because of the second amendment you like freedom of speech well you better like
[02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:11.040]  your right to bear arms because you can't have one without the other the second amendment was not
[02:57:11.040 --> 02:57:18.240]  written for hunting deer you hear people say like you know they had muskets back then there's no way
[02:57:18.240 --> 02:57:22.240]  that they could have imagined the type of technology that we have today no that's that's malarkey
[02:57:22.240 --> 02:57:27.120]  they they knew what was coming the founding fathers were brilliant they were engineers they
[02:57:27.120 --> 02:57:31.040]  weren't like the politicians of today that never had a job in their life they actually did things
[02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:34.240]  for a living when they wrote that constitution there were already guns there were essentially
[02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:38.480]  gaitling guns they knew that those type that type of technology was coming so when people are like
[02:57:38.480 --> 02:57:44.560]  you know do you really need an automatic weapon to go deer hunting you know it it wasn't written
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:49.760]  for deer if the deer were going to then come try to imprison me and then search my home and then
[02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:55.440]  take what's mine then yeah i need a ar-15 for deer hunting but that's not the case it was written
[02:57:55.440 --> 02:58:00.000]  for the government it was written so the people always have more power than the government now
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:05.920]  that preponderance has shifted it has gone from the people being the ones that have the power to
[02:58:05.920 --> 02:58:11.280]  now we're scared of the government we have to go back to a dangerous freedom that's where people
[02:58:11.280 --> 02:58:16.160]  have more power than the government that is people having guns that is people having better guns
[02:58:16.160 --> 02:58:21.520]  than the government yeah it's scary but last time we had somebody cruise into san bernadino
[02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:27.840]  into a gun free zone two people a couple of guns killed countless all right we're gonna fade that

[03:00:14.240 --> 03:00:18.560]  news i didn't get to that i've got to get to i'm sure he's gonna cover it too but report uh
[03:00:18.560 --> 03:00:24.960]  trump refused 200 million to pick genrich as vp okay that happened that comes from inside the campaign
[03:00:26.160 --> 03:00:31.920]  a month ago and then i talked to other little birdies and they said yeah how do you know about
[03:00:31.920 --> 03:00:36.880]  that we're pretty shocked but then they said yeah wait for genrich to start attacking trump that
[03:00:36.880 --> 03:00:43.200]  began two days ago here's the article report trump refused 200 million to pick genrich as vp
[03:00:43.200 --> 03:00:48.480]  establishment tries to control trump through vp pic and that's that whole schulden adelson situation
[03:00:48.480 --> 03:00:52.240]  he's pledged 100 million but he said 200 million of you pick genrich as soon as you didn't pick
[03:00:52.240 --> 03:00:55.920]  genrich again we started coming out against him and notice now that he's really mounting against
[03:00:55.920 --> 03:01:00.240]  trump trumps for real folks and that's why they're pulling out all the stops right now
[03:01:00.240 --> 03:01:05.280]  let's go to our intrepid reporters i want to talk some to you do then we come back from break a few
[03:01:05.280 --> 03:01:10.240]  minutes uh with um josh show us to get his take on this he's not just a camera guy's reporter too
[03:01:10.240 --> 03:01:14.960]  but what's happened since we had john about an hour and a half ago uh my friend well as we were
[03:01:14.960 --> 03:01:18.960]  walking down in front of the hotel we did a quick report about the symbolism in front of it this is
[03:01:18.960 --> 03:01:22.800]  robert reporting live from dresden germany and guess why i ran into alex you may remember this
[03:01:22.800 --> 03:01:27.680]  guy from last year who confronted franko bernieby at the train station this is mr tilman who is now
[03:01:27.680 --> 03:01:31.920]  a mat look at him he's all dressed up now he's ready he's back he's got a camera crew with him
[03:01:31.920 --> 03:01:36.320]  and he's ready to take on the globalists and confront more people because you know you just
[03:01:36.320 --> 03:01:41.360]  can't stop once you get going mr tilman how's it going oh pretty good i know i have three people
[03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:47.200]  with me i have a little camera team so i try this again now i mean we can search for them at the
[03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:52.640]  train station at the airport and then we have hopefully have another video i guess and alex
[03:01:52.640 --> 03:01:58.640]  mr tilman is just uh an example of what one person can do with a camera confronted two different
[03:01:58.640 --> 03:02:02.480]  of these elite globalists here one at the airport one at the train and they gave us comments that
[03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:07.600]  were huge in news making we're exposing the shadow government that's the process exactly exactly and
[03:02:07.600 --> 03:02:12.480]  that that's the testament to what's going on here now he's back you know he's tripled his uh his
[03:02:12.480 --> 03:02:17.600]  reserves he's got three guys now so they can cover multiple locations and it's just a testament
[03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:22.000]  to what one man could do and so i'm doing this for people out there who are watching this who are
[03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:25.840]  sitting on the sidelines going should i go to bill diverge should i do yes come out here you never
[03:02:25.840 --> 03:02:30.160]  know you might be the one guy somewhere who gets the one globalist getting out of the car and then
[03:02:30.160 --> 03:02:34.880]  other people will emulate what you've done it just gets you this is part of humanity reawakening
[03:02:34.880 --> 03:02:38.560]  exactly tell me give everybody your uh youtube channel so people can watch what you're doing
[03:02:38.560 --> 03:02:43.680]  and this is two hot names but one is burgerberg it's like citizen citizen and builderberg like
[03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:48.720]  burgerberg within you and it's how kind from me it's like german mark yeah the best way on the
[03:02:48.720 --> 03:02:53.680]  left is just by your name just just tell folks your name till my next is so no don't connect
[03:02:53.680 --> 03:02:58.400]  which they were telling me actually connecto his last name means slave but this man is not a slave
[03:02:58.400 --> 03:03:03.360]  he's a free man he's not acting he's not submitting well well sure he's not what he's told me now
[03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:07.920]  i mean the word sports in europe means black and all that meant was you were suntan from working
[03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:13.600]  like sword snager means black plowman and and and so yes it just means lower cast but thank god it's
[03:03:13.600 --> 03:03:17.840]  the lower cast in the world that always comes up with the innovations not all the inbred people
[03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:23.600]  like prince charles was snot dripping out of his nose exactly exactly so it was funny just running
[03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:29.120]  into him just now he's gonna be here for the rest of the week just covering what's going on and this
[03:03:29.120 --> 03:03:33.600]  is you know other people need to get out here and do this we got we need more people we need numbers
[03:03:33.600 --> 03:03:38.400]  with uh this is how things get done this is citizen media at its finest you know info wars is
[03:03:38.400 --> 03:03:42.960]  is we're a big dog out there but we need more people the more people we get the more things the more
[03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:47.680]  angles the more human human intelligence exactly exactly because somebody needs to get lindsay
[03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:51.600]  graham and take him to task what are you doing here as a sitting senator coming here and negotiate
[03:03:51.600 --> 03:03:55.040]  with people in private how do you like your world government being exposed why are you part of
[03:03:55.040 --> 03:03:59.600]  flooding us this organization's flooding our borders you're a trader graham yeah yeah exactly
[03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:02.960]  he's all he's part of the whole game and then you have all these german politicians that are
[03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:06.720]  going to be coming here they're all they're all welcoming the migrants giving them free housing
[03:04:06.720 --> 03:04:11.200]  free food what do you think about what's going on in germany i mean yeah the politicians just
[03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:16.240]  betrayed us i mean they let in like they just doubled or tripled like the immigration rate and
[03:04:16.240 --> 03:04:20.960]  the immigration rate was already pretty high i guess we have the biggest immigration in europe
[03:04:20.960 --> 03:04:24.400]  and by the way he's not allowed to go to Saudi arabia they haven't taken one of the little jihad
[03:04:24.400 --> 03:04:29.920]  hotties there because they they're not taking jihadis they're sending jihadis yeah yeah exactly
[03:04:29.920 --> 03:04:34.640]  and it's going to be 90 billion they say over the next 10 years just to house and feed these people
[03:04:34.640 --> 03:04:38.880]  and give them uh you know not let them work so they want to bring these people here not let
[03:04:38.880 --> 03:04:42.240]  them get work not let them integrate in society what are you creating you're creating ticking
[03:04:42.240 --> 03:04:48.880]  time bombs that's right okay rob great job i want to talk to absolutely i want to talk briefly uh to
[03:04:49.440 --> 03:04:52.320]  jaw show as we come back and then i'm gonna let you guys get back to uploading videos and the
[03:04:52.320 --> 03:04:57.840]  great work you're doing watch their videos as they're uploaded but by the hour info wars dot com
[03:04:57.840 --> 03:05:03.600]  you can read the whole list at drugreport dot com of the billard hillary clinton has no shortage
[03:05:03.600 --> 03:05:10.160]  of celebrity endorsements including actress eva longoria snoop d o double g and kim kardasian
[03:05:10.160 --> 03:05:15.600]  now she's gaining support from an unlikely source for a very bizarre reason scott adams

[03:05:37.920 --> 03:05:44.000]  trump took her so-called woman card and turned it into a liability so clinton wisely pivoted

[03:08:30.320 --> 03:08:33.680]  states with california being the big prize tonight with our reporters out in california
[03:08:33.680 --> 03:08:39.280]  leon macadoo and joe begs and uh michael zimmerman then of course we've got our intrepid reporters
[03:08:39.280 --> 03:08:44.240]  paul joseph watson who's now in germany but has to meet them flowing from the uk from formally
[03:08:44.240 --> 03:08:49.680]  england uh into the e u proper there uh where england merkel is helping open the borders
[03:08:49.680 --> 03:08:53.760]  they're going to be uh they're reporting tonight as well right through this weekend
[03:08:53.760 --> 03:09:00.320]  at bill durberg 2016 what a victory it is for humanity that they're being exposed
[03:09:00.320 --> 03:09:03.920]  what a victory that the shadow government apparatus is being brought out in the open
[03:09:03.920 --> 03:09:08.880]  so there can be a major debate about it this is something the globalist absolutely hate
[03:09:08.880 --> 03:09:14.080]  they cannot stand it but it's only going to get worse for them as humanities crash course in
[03:09:14.080 --> 03:09:22.160]  reality uh only expands deepens uh and explodes but a report i've had in my little hand for an hour
[03:09:22.160 --> 03:09:26.240]  that tit daniels handed me is so important i asked him to do the report we gave him the
[03:09:26.240 --> 03:09:29.920]  sources the intel he did it i should have been covering it the last hour it's so big
[03:09:30.800 --> 03:09:36.080]  because i saw the last two days newt genrich out savaging donald trump over all sorts of stuff
[03:09:36.080 --> 03:09:40.640]  attacking him misrepresenting him on different subjects and i knew it was coming i mean this
[03:09:40.640 --> 03:09:44.880]  is one of the top globalist minions in the u.s genrich is super bad he helped leave the whole
[03:09:44.880 --> 03:09:51.360]  conservative libertarian revolution in the 90s and 93 94 down a rat hole he then he gave us
[03:09:51.360 --> 03:09:57.440]  bainer and you know all these other little creatures after him just one rhino after another
[03:09:57.440 --> 03:10:02.960]  but report trump refuses 200 million to pick genrich's vp establishment tries to control
[03:10:02.960 --> 03:10:08.000]  trump through vp pic and i have this confirmed i knew about adelson offering trump 100 million
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:12.960]  dollars for four days before it was in the news and i knew all about the you know the big of the
[03:10:12.960 --> 03:10:17.680]  other big meetings but i have multiple sources this is not from stone but i brought this up to stone
[03:10:17.680 --> 03:10:22.400]  and he let me just say i don't have no comment on what he told me but donald trump refused 200
[03:10:22.400 --> 03:10:27.280]  million in donations to take newt genrich's vice president insiders told info wars the
[03:10:27.280 --> 03:10:32.160]  mainstream media report that the casino magnate uh sheldon adelson was willing to contribute 100
[03:10:32.160 --> 03:10:38.880]  million to trump's campaign but what wasn't reported that about a week later was the additional 200
[03:10:38.880 --> 03:10:44.000]  million uh the establishment offered trump in exchange for picking genrich one of the first
[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:50.000]  dc insiders to try and cozy up to the mogul and i think i should just add that i gave us all his
[03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:55.680]  assault to kit adelson offered him 100 million then he upped it to 200 so it was an adelson
[03:10:55.680 --> 03:10:59.520]  then offered an additional 100 million according to sources so we should just add that there for
[03:10:59.520 --> 03:11:06.160]  clarification when trump declined the offer however genrich started lashing out on him publicly
[03:11:06.160 --> 03:11:10.800]  including his recent claim that trump made one of his worst mistakes for pointing out the federal
[03:11:10.800 --> 03:11:16.000]  judge handling the trump university lawsuit has ties to the controversial la raza hispanic nationalist
[03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:21.600]  organization well he's a lawyer for him and gives scholarships to illegal aliens i don't know what
[03:11:21.600 --> 03:11:25.600]  trump's reasoning was and i don't care genrich told the washington post it'd be unlikely for
[03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:31.760]  genrich to take such a weird stance in a manner uh unless he was already bitter at trump and trying
[03:11:31.760 --> 03:11:37.440]  to pressure him to change his mind but it's in trump's best interest to pick someone close
[03:11:37.440 --> 03:11:42.240]  to him ideologically as vp senator jeff sessions who we believe it's going to be let's just say
[03:11:43.040 --> 03:11:48.560]  that's 95 right now to avoid a potential assassination attempt and then we go into the
[03:11:48.560 --> 03:11:55.920]  whole ronald riggan attempt at assassination and the rest of history and we link to the video where
[03:11:57.600 --> 03:12:04.480]  we had uh roger stone in studio with us breaking down his take on who the vp will be and concurring
[03:12:04.480 --> 03:12:10.720]  that at all points towards sessions but we're about to hand the baton to david night but first
[03:12:10.720 --> 03:12:14.000]  i wanted to go back to dresden germany and by the way when you hand the baton david want to keep
[03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:17.680]  talking to these guys you're welcome to or whatever you choose i know david's always got a lot of
[03:12:17.680 --> 03:12:20.640]  stuff i haven't covered he's about to hit and some things i have covered it's just good to
[03:12:20.640 --> 03:12:24.320]  always get his perspective and then they go oh yeah i forgot to cover that glad david's gonna
[03:12:24.320 --> 03:12:30.400]  cover it so david night sitting in there in the situation room i'm in the war room we are broadcasting
[03:12:30.400 --> 03:12:37.840]  radio slash tv and info wars dot com forward slash show and tv stations u h f v h f cable
[03:12:37.840 --> 03:12:42.240]  and radio stations across the country and the world but going to josh owens who's our wonderful
[03:12:42.240 --> 03:12:48.720]  reporter and cameraman there with rob do he's always got a lot to say what have you observed
[03:12:48.720 --> 03:12:55.360]  since we talked 24 hours ago mr owens there at the side of bill deberg 2016 well there's a lot
[03:12:55.360 --> 03:13:00.080]  going on obviously uh if we were another news agency we would probably come out here and just
[03:13:00.080 --> 03:13:04.320]  cover one thing we would probably just cover the the migrants we would just cover bill deberg but
[03:13:04.320 --> 03:13:07.760]  that's not what info wars does we got a lot of irons in the fire we're doing a lot while we're
[03:13:07.760 --> 03:13:11.760]  here and that's how that's how it's supposed to be because we actually enjoy what we're doing we
[03:13:11.760 --> 03:13:16.400]  actually enjoy being here covering showing the people what's really going on so we got a lot
[03:13:16.400 --> 03:13:20.960]  of things going on here but one thing that don't think he was talking has talked about yet it is
[03:13:20.960 --> 03:13:26.640]  strange that usually every four years bill deberg is held in the us so that would mean it for election
[03:13:26.640 --> 03:13:30.560]  reasons that would mean this year bill deberg will be in the united states but it's not now let's
[03:13:30.560 --> 03:13:35.360]  think about that why would it be in europe what's going on in europe what's the thing that's all
[03:13:35.360 --> 03:13:42.640]  over the news it's the migrant crisis as if it's not planned uh this is the curriculum this is what
[03:13:42.640 --> 03:13:48.000]  the united states is planning for with the open borders with all these social justice warriors
[03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:53.600]  going out and attacking everyone at trump rallies this is what they are hoping to get out of it europe
[03:13:53.600 --> 03:13:59.520]  this big melting pot where everything is crumbling uh you you saw the videos where we went to the
[03:13:59.520 --> 03:14:05.440]  refugee camps they bum rushed us they freaked out because we had a camera we see that in america too
[03:14:05.440 --> 03:14:10.240]  but uh we're not trying to hurt anybody we're not you know honestly we're not even trying
[03:14:10.240 --> 03:14:15.760]  to spin a story all we're doing is is asking questions so you see them come up and attack us
[03:14:15.760 --> 03:14:21.200]  but then the concern then is that when the city official comes up he says well um we don't want
[03:14:21.200 --> 03:14:24.880]  him to feel threatened but it's okay if we feel threatened but not then we see this happening
[03:14:24.880 --> 03:14:29.520]  in the united states so it's very interesting to note that bill deberg should as the past
[03:14:29.520 --> 03:14:33.680]  should be happening in the united states now but it's not it's happening in europe and i believe
[03:14:34.320 --> 03:14:38.960]  it's because this is the curriculum this is where everything is heading right down the toilet bowl
[03:14:39.520 --> 03:14:44.960]  well josh excellent point that we should call this little live video piece uh you know secret to
[03:14:44.960 --> 03:14:49.680]  why bill deberg's not being held in the us this year revealed or ask the question why is bill deberg
[03:14:49.680 --> 03:14:53.680]  not being held in the u.s this year because every fourth year since it was started back in the
[03:14:53.680 --> 03:15:02.080]  40s right through the 50s uh bill deberg has been held uh every fourth year in the united states on
[03:15:02.080 --> 03:15:07.040]  the east coast and of course it was officially supposedly around you know in the early 50s but
[03:15:07.040 --> 03:15:10.880]  it's been around since the end of world war two it was just given the name bill deberg off the
[03:15:10.880 --> 03:15:16.640]  oosterbeck holland uh hotel where they uh you know officially codified and signed a transatlantic
[03:15:16.640 --> 03:15:22.080]  agreement to merge a european union with an american union with an asian union a basically
[03:15:22.080 --> 03:15:27.440]  rockefeller trilateralist plan with the british empire and the founding documents were given to
[03:15:27.440 --> 03:15:33.440]  bbc what 14 years ago and concurred with everything jim tucker had said everything investigators had
[03:15:33.440 --> 03:15:38.640]  said it was spot on it's a planetary plan of unelected world government will look at tpp look
[03:15:38.640 --> 03:15:43.360]  at na u look at the e you you don't vote to enter it you're under it it starts making all your laws
[03:15:43.360 --> 03:15:47.760]  you can't get out of it it brings in all these illegals and then arrest you if you hand out
[03:15:47.760 --> 03:15:53.280]  flyers or gives you tickets i mean we are witnessing a totalitarian takeover and it's simply amazing
[03:15:53.280 --> 03:15:58.240]  josh owens exactly and we see uh paul joseph watchton's article they're going to be talking
[03:15:58.240 --> 03:16:01.440]  about the brexit they're going to be talking about trump obviously they're going to be talking
[03:16:01.440 --> 03:16:05.280]  about trump because they're in damage control mode trying to figure out what to do because the
[03:16:05.280 --> 03:16:13.120]  people have spoken trump is uh the republican nominee and um they're free you know obviously
[03:16:13.120 --> 03:16:19.600]  that's why it linds grand grand coming down here uh your sky's breaking up my friend great job again

[03:18:34.320 --> 03:18:39.520]  about what newt gingrich is doing because we all know what's really behind this attack on
[03:18:39.520 --> 03:18:45.600]  donald trump i talked about this on sunday and alex when newt gingrich came out and started
[03:18:45.600 --> 03:18:52.640]  criticizing donald trump calling this an excusable saying he had to take this back and uh this was
[03:18:52.640 --> 03:18:57.360]  the worst thing that donald trump had done i said on sunday when i saw those comments i said this
[03:18:57.360 --> 03:19:03.760]  could be very good news we've been very worried about gingrich cozying up to trump were they
[03:19:03.760 --> 03:19:08.560]  going to be able to turn him i mean this guy is essentially a stalking horse for the establishment
[03:19:08.560 --> 03:19:14.000]  for the globalist elitists and we were all very concerned when we saw newt gingrich start sniffing
[03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:19.920]  around donald trump and so i'm very i had absolutely no idea exactly this is another plus
[03:19:19.920 --> 03:19:24.240]  certifying that trumps for real yeah yeah i hate you hadn't told me any of this and and of course
[03:19:24.240 --> 03:19:30.400]  you just gave this to kitten put out this information and we remember back four years ago

[03:19:35.680 --> 03:19:40.800]  and then shortly after that newt gingrich crashed and burned so that's a really good sign to me
[03:19:40.800 --> 03:19:47.520]  uh again of trumps being his own man being authentic on the globalism versus nationalism issue
[03:19:47.520 --> 03:19:52.240]  and the more these guys line up and come after him like this bill de berger lindsey graham

[03:24:16.480 --> 03:24:22.000]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night on this tuesday june 7th 2014 this is
[03:24:22.000 --> 03:24:26.240]  going to be a big night for the primaries of course we're going to be here live with our coverage
[03:24:26.240 --> 03:24:32.160]  and there are primaries six final primaries from coast to coast it's going to begin with new jersey
[03:24:32.160 --> 03:24:37.840]  on the east coast it will finish up with california on the west coast and there are returns from states
[03:24:37.840 --> 03:24:42.320]  that'll be in between so every hour we're going to have some polls closing in different states so
[03:24:42.320 --> 03:24:46.480]  it's going to be a long broadcast tonight it's going to be live uh we'll be taking your calls
[03:24:46.480 --> 03:24:51.440]  we'll be having our correspondents in new jersey as well as california we're going to be joining
[03:24:51.440 --> 03:24:56.560]  joe biggs in california in just a few minutes they'll be calling in telling us what people are
[03:24:56.560 --> 03:25:00.320]  telling them as they're coming in and out of the polls how people feel about this and of course if
[03:25:00.320 --> 03:25:06.560]  we look at the results of the polls and this whole super delegate issue between bernie and hillary
[03:25:07.200 --> 03:25:12.960]  his hope i think has been all along that he would exceed hillary in terms of pledged delegates or
[03:25:12.960 --> 03:25:17.520]  you could call them earned delegates these would be the delegates that he gets based on votes
[03:25:17.520 --> 03:25:25.600]  right now he's not winning that he's actually losing about 54 46 something like that so he's
[03:25:25.600 --> 03:25:31.040]  hoping that he can turn that around in california that would be what he would take to a brokered
[03:25:31.040 --> 03:25:37.200]  convention he would say look i've won more than hillary has in the voting booth and the only reason
[03:25:37.200 --> 03:25:41.600]  that she's beating me is because of the super delegates if he could do that he would have
[03:25:41.600 --> 03:25:45.920]  an argument to make there if he can't do that if he can't beat her with the pledged delegates
[03:25:45.920 --> 03:25:49.760]  he's not going to really have that argument and understand that she started out
[03:25:49.760 --> 03:25:54.560]  with 15 percent of what she needed to win the election so we're going to be talking about that
[03:25:54.560 --> 03:25:59.680]  and breaking that down if you look at the democrat primaries every one of these is proportional and
[03:25:59.680 --> 03:26:07.200]  because there's no winner take all primaries when they split 55 45 the delegates are pretty evenly
[03:26:07.200 --> 03:26:11.440]  split and the difference is that in every one of these states you've got about 10 to 15 percent
[03:26:11.440 --> 03:26:18.880]  of the delegates who are super delegates and so he has to beat her by 10 or 15 percent just to
[03:26:18.880 --> 03:26:26.320]  break even and then if she beats him by 10 or 15 percent he loses that's how they rig the game okay
[03:26:26.320 --> 03:26:30.560]  that's how the game is rigged and we've seen this play out state by state so we're going to
[03:26:30.560 --> 03:26:34.400]  watch it play out one final time tonight we're going to talk about a lot of political news we're
[03:26:34.400 --> 03:26:39.200]  going to go into more detail about the racism charges and as i mentioned on sunday and i
[03:26:39.200 --> 03:26:46.640]  was repeated yesterday when i gave the quotes from cesar chavez the union organizer he said look
[03:26:46.640 --> 03:26:52.480]  i don't want to hear about la raza it is racist you know we talk about la raza and we talk about
[03:26:52.480 --> 03:26:59.040]  this judge who is part of the la raza lawyers what is their mission their mission is stated
[03:26:59.040 --> 03:27:06.720]  as empowering hispanic lawyers making sure there are more hispanic lawyers and giving scholarships
[03:27:06.720 --> 03:27:15.120]  to first one illegal think about that giving a scholarship to an illegal so he can go to law school
[03:27:16.400 --> 03:27:23.440]  first thing this guy did was to violate the laws how's that for ethics okay so that's what
[03:27:23.440 --> 03:27:30.480]  they're looking for everything is about hispanic this hispanic that the name is the race cesar
[03:27:30.480 --> 03:27:35.920]  chavez said we're not going to go there it is racist it's discrimination they're they're actually
[03:27:35.920 --> 03:27:40.640]  anti gringo it's what he said and he says you start out as anti gringo you're going to be anti
[03:27:40.640 --> 03:27:46.320]  negro and where does it stop it doesn't stop but of course that's what we have seen from the
[03:27:46.320 --> 03:27:51.440]  racialism in our politics i've got all these quotes from all the people who don't like trump
[03:27:51.440 --> 03:27:57.200]  calling him a racist all the way out to libertarian candidate gary johnson trump is clearly a racist
[03:27:57.200 --> 03:28:02.240]  and all these establishment republicans and quite frankly gary johnson is one of the biggest
[03:28:02.240 --> 03:28:08.160]  shills for the globalist elitist that you could ever find anywhere in any party and he's calling
[03:28:08.160 --> 03:28:13.600]  trump a racist they understand if they want to look at that they they can't not know that this
[03:28:13.600 --> 03:28:21.680]  guy is a la raza lawyer and they can't not know that la raza is like kkk lock kuklux klan okay
[03:28:21.680 --> 03:28:28.560]  it's just a hispanic kuklux klan save our cesar chavez pointed that out all right now in the
[03:28:28.560 --> 03:28:34.800]  short period of time that we've got i want to talk about what's going on with the epa and we've
[03:28:34.800 --> 03:28:40.800]  covered the story in the past remember that gold mine that they blew up out west there's an article
[03:28:40.800 --> 03:28:47.680]  from the daily caller saying well after a decades long battle this has gone on since the mid 90s okay
[03:28:47.680 --> 03:28:51.280]  they've been fighting with the epa the epa came in there and said well we want to turn your area
[03:28:51.280 --> 03:28:56.720]  into a super fun they said no we don't want you to do that and if you remember when this gold mine
[03:28:56.720 --> 03:29:01.600]  blew up and they spewed and this is because of what the epa did okay the the mine didn't
[03:29:01.600 --> 03:29:08.560]  blow up the epa went in and caused it to blow up and we showed you the articles at the time and
[03:29:08.560 --> 03:29:14.720]  the opeds were written by a retired miner who predicted a month before this was going this
[03:29:14.720 --> 03:29:21.040]  happened said the epa is going to come in here what they're doing i know as a mining engineer and
[03:29:21.040 --> 03:29:25.440]  they would know as well because they are also involved in this business they are going to
[03:29:25.440 --> 03:29:32.640]  deliberately blow this mine up and the end result is they want to do this so they can create a
[03:29:32.640 --> 03:29:37.360]  super fund out of this area what i didn't know until i read this article was that they've been
[03:29:37.360 --> 03:29:43.600]  fighting to turn this into a super fun for 25 years so they come in and it's a self-fulfilling
[03:29:43.600 --> 03:29:48.160]  regulatory takeover they blow the mine up they pollute the river the drinking water for three
[03:29:48.160 --> 03:29:53.600]  states with toxic minerals make it a super fun stay with us on the march the empires on the run
[03:29:53.600 --> 03:29:57.280]  Alex Jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:01.680 --> 03:30:07.840]  three years after the irs admitted officials singled out conservative groups for extra scrutiny
[03:30:07.840 --> 03:30:13.280]  the tax collecting agency has released a near complete list of the organization's targeted
[03:30:13.280 --> 03:30:18.560]  and it numbers in the hundreds for the first time showing the extent to which the agency
[03:30:18.560 --> 03:30:25.280]  slow walked applications for tax exam status reports fox news the new list shows a total of
[03:30:25.280 --> 03:30:30.960]  426 organizations far higher than what the treasury department's inspector general
[03:30:30.960 --> 03:30:37.200]  believed there to be back in may 2013 when he identified nearly 300 groups the names banned
[03:30:37.200 --> 03:30:42.960]  the gamut covering well-known groups like the tea party patriots but also lower profile locals
[03:30:42.960 --> 03:30:48.800]  like the louisiana campaign for liberty patriots of charleston the ashfield tea party incorporated
[03:30:48.800 --> 03:30:55.440]  and many more a federal judge earlier this year scolded the irs for allegedly holding up request

[03:33:54.000 --> 03:33:59.760]  and i had a chance to interview quite a few people it was uh it was pretty startling to see how many
[03:33:59.760 --> 03:34:05.520]  citizens out here in california uh could care less about ben gazi that wanted a complete and
[03:34:05.520 --> 03:34:11.040]  total sweep of guns to take them all away i mean it was frightening to see and hear some of these

[03:34:16.240 --> 03:34:21.280]  she said there's two things that are central to her campaign one of them is immigration and she's
[03:34:21.280 --> 03:34:25.760]  going to legalize everybody within a hundred days and part of these campaign did she have some
[03:34:26.320 --> 03:34:30.160]  college students with her there where she was having the dog and pony show because she did
[03:34:30.160 --> 03:34:35.360]  that this weekend she had college students who were bragging about the fact that they were sticking
[03:34:36.240 --> 03:34:41.600]  the american taxpayer with these astronomical college bills i mean nobody even asks why the
[03:34:41.600 --> 03:34:47.680]  college bills are so expensive we have an article on info wars dot com illegals openly brag about
[03:34:47.680 --> 03:34:51.680]  their scholarships on twitter three hundred thousand dollar scholarship two hundred eighty
[03:34:51.680 --> 03:34:56.400]  two thousand dollar scholarship i mean i'd gone through and looked at this small college azusa
[03:34:56.400 --> 03:35:00.480]  pacific where they had a south korean girl bragging about the fact she was here illegally
[03:35:00.480 --> 03:35:04.400]  i did the math on that i said look that's a hundred and seventy seven thousand dollars
[03:35:04.400 --> 03:35:10.800]  that this lady is sticking us with and uh you know just over her four-year period it's absolutely
[03:35:10.800 --> 03:35:14.880]  amazing that it would cost us much anymore for a college education there's no way that you could
[03:35:14.880 --> 03:35:18.880]  justify that if you were spending the money or you were borrowing the money but of course
[03:35:18.880 --> 03:35:23.040]  if you can stick it to the taxpayer that's a great deal and hillary clinton is just
[03:35:23.040 --> 03:35:27.840]  sitting there nodding about it and then the other thing is uh firearms absolute total gun
[03:35:27.840 --> 03:35:33.760]  control the thing that bothers me joe is that we've got the libertarians which i never thought i
[03:35:33.760 --> 03:35:40.080]  would see the day where the libertarian party nominates two anti-gun people like gary johnson
[03:35:40.080 --> 03:35:47.040]  and william weld who say the second amendment doesn't apply to anything other than hunting guns and
[03:35:47.040 --> 03:35:51.840]  we can have an assault weapon ban we can have all kinds of control and tracking on ammunition
[03:35:51.840 --> 03:35:57.680]  that's what william weld did as governor and he's not backing down on that in 2016 he stands by it
[03:35:57.680 --> 03:36:02.720]  he says well none of those guns are one to ban we're hunting rifles well yeah what's going on with
[03:36:02.720 --> 03:36:06.480]  the second amendment it's pretty huge in california they're actually trying to pass a bill that will
[03:36:06.480 --> 03:36:11.600]  make it illegal to own any kind of weapon that has a detachable magazine and hillary clinton and her
[03:36:11.600 --> 03:36:17.840]  gun grabbing uh uh ways she actually brought one of her speakers is gavin newson gavin newson is known
[03:36:17.840 --> 03:36:23.760]  for a lot of these very uh horrible anti-second amendment laws in california and uh he paraded
[03:36:23.760 --> 03:36:28.800]  her out there he introduced her and was so happy to have hillary here you know and and they were
[03:36:28.800 --> 03:36:33.120]  just kind of laughing about you know the whole gun thing it's pretty ridiculous you know because
[03:36:33.120 --> 03:36:39.200]  long beach is a very trendy kind of spot but then you just go a few miles south and you're in
[03:36:39.200 --> 03:36:44.320]  huntington that's a very strong conservative area where they want their guns they want their freedom
[03:36:44.320 --> 03:36:48.480]  they want big uh big government out of there they want uh more states rights and they want
[03:36:48.480 --> 03:36:53.840]  more freedom to the people so it's it's california is really weird you know it differs you know miles
[03:36:53.840 --> 03:36:59.760]  away just how liberal it can go from the conservative it's really crazy it's all over the place but
[03:36:59.760 --> 03:37:04.000]  it's predominantly liberal and i talked about these gun control measures that are coming up
[03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:10.640]  previously i think it's uh a sweeping number of measures it's something like uh seven different
[03:37:10.640 --> 03:37:14.960]  measures and and they're even going to control and track ammunition purchases as part of this
[03:37:14.960 --> 03:37:20.000]  and that's a key thing because if you can't buy ammunition you've got even if you have a gun uh
[03:37:20.000 --> 03:37:23.840]  it it's nothing but a club and one of the other things they're doing joe is they're even going
[03:37:23.840 --> 03:37:29.760]  to put regulations on historical guns uh going back to the 19th century they've that's pretty much
[03:37:29.760 --> 03:37:35.360]  unprecedented yeah it's crazy to see that kind of stuff happen and gavin Newsom's the guy that's
[03:37:35.360 --> 03:37:38.640]  behind it and that's why he wants someone like hillary clinton that's why he's going to endorse
[03:37:38.640 --> 03:37:42.800]  someone like her because she's going to allow that to happen and soon enough it's not just
[03:37:42.800 --> 03:37:47.680]  going to be california it's going to sweep across the nation you know uh yesterday vermin supreme
[03:37:47.680 --> 03:37:51.600]  he is one of the candidates was running in the libertarian party was actually out here at the
[03:37:51.600 --> 03:37:56.160]  event and i had a chance to talk to him and police came over and started harassing him
[03:37:56.160 --> 03:38:01.600]  saying that he might be arrested if he was standing out there uh with his bullhorn walking around
[03:38:01.600 --> 03:38:06.240]  and it's not against any kind of law to have a bullhorn but the police actually went up to him only
[03:38:07.120 --> 03:38:11.200]  and harassed this guy and we're sitting there and i started filming it and i heard the guy the
[03:38:11.200 --> 03:38:15.040]  police officer say you need to go to your free speech zone and i said what did you say officer
[03:38:15.040 --> 03:38:20.080]  he goes free speech zone it's over there and i said well i'm anti hillary i'm not here protesting
[03:38:20.080 --> 03:38:24.560]  i've got tons of people with me with hillary for prison t-shirts on i said why do you not come up to
[03:38:24.560 --> 03:38:29.520]  me and he just kind of completely changed his tone but he said you know if he had to he would come
[03:38:29.520 --> 03:38:34.720]  back and arrest vermin supreme for being out there because he was he had this spill where he called
[03:38:34.720 --> 03:38:38.960]  it uh welcome to the hillary clinton checkpoint and he was doing like a tsa thing where he's like be
[03:38:38.960 --> 03:38:43.680]  prepared to go inside the stadium you must take off your shirt your blouse your pants get a rectal
[03:38:43.680 --> 03:38:48.480]  exam to be able to see her harness you know and did this whole thing well you know joe when we were
[03:38:48.480 --> 03:38:52.960]  out at the bunny ranch one of the things that got everybody upset about that was that the blm
[03:38:52.960 --> 03:38:58.720]  had the audacity out in the middle of nowhere to put in a cordon area and say this is a first
[03:38:58.720 --> 03:39:03.760]  amendment area and had a handprinted had a machine printed sign and somebody put up a handprinted
[03:39:03.760 --> 03:39:09.360]  sign and said the first amendment is not an area we've seen these free speech zones at every one
[03:39:09.360 --> 03:39:14.320]  of the republican and democrat conventions for quite some time now they put everybody in a cage
[03:39:14.320 --> 03:39:20.640]  literally they put free speech in a cage and they remove it remote from the convention itself so
[03:39:20.640 --> 03:39:27.920]  nobody is bothered by seeing anyone protesting that is a clear violation of the constitution
[03:39:27.920 --> 03:39:32.880]  and it's a good example for the first amendment of what happens when your rights your fundamental
[03:39:32.880 --> 03:39:38.640]  rights like free speech are turned into government granted privileges they essentially box them in
[03:39:38.640 --> 03:39:43.200]  and take them away and the same thing is being done in california with these regulations it's
[03:39:43.200 --> 03:39:49.520]  what hillary clinton wants to do they put so many conditions and regulations on your rights
[03:39:49.520 --> 03:39:53.840]  by infringing on them that they turn those fundamental rights into privileges and you
[03:39:53.840 --> 03:39:58.960]  mentioned Gavin Newsom there's actually a competition going on between two democrats who
[03:39:58.960 --> 03:40:02.640]  want to run for governor one of them is the current lieutenant governor there the other is the
[03:40:02.640 --> 03:40:08.240]  speaker of the house they're both competing to see how far over the top they can go on gun control
[03:40:08.240 --> 03:40:11.920]  and we've seen that kind of competition between hillary and bernie hillary is is criticizing
[03:40:11.920 --> 03:40:17.760]  bernie because he doesn't want to allow people to sue gun manufacturers out of business when they
[03:40:17.760 --> 03:40:21.840]  haven't done anything wrong at hillary says well anytime there's a shooting you ought to be able
[03:40:21.840 --> 03:40:26.480]  to sue the gun manufacturer even if they even though you've got the second amendment and
[03:40:26.480 --> 03:40:31.680]  a specific law that was passed by congress that said no you can't sue people if they don't have
[03:40:31.680 --> 03:40:35.120]  any liability if they didn't do anything wrong just like you can't sue for it if there's an
[03:40:35.120 --> 03:40:40.800]  automobile accident because the guy was driving drunk interesting when the guy said free speech
[03:40:40.800 --> 03:40:45.680]  zone i said isn't our country a free speech zone don't we have a first amendment and he's kind of
[03:40:45.680 --> 03:40:49.760]  chuckled or whatever you know but one of the interesting things i want to point out as well
[03:40:49.760 --> 03:40:55.520]  i shot a video yesterday pointing out the trickery behind the clinton campaign now at the long beach
[03:40:55.520 --> 03:41:01.520]  city college they used a they picked a 800 person venue but they invited thousands of people out
[03:41:01.520 --> 03:41:06.000]  there and it left a giant line of people wrapped around the the street and i actually went up to
[03:41:06.000 --> 03:41:09.440]  one of the officers and i said hey sir i was like this looks like there's a lot of people out here
[03:41:09.440 --> 03:41:14.080]  and he was kind of an awake cop he goes he goes man this is all an illusion he goes that venue
[03:41:14.080 --> 03:41:19.600]  right there holds 800 people is it look next door there's a football stadium holds 15 000 people
[03:41:19.600 --> 03:41:24.560]  why do you think she chose this venue over the one next door that holds way more people he says to
[03:41:24.560 --> 03:41:29.680]  get the illusion when the mainstream media films this it looks like tons of people couldn't get into
[03:41:29.680 --> 03:41:35.360]  her event but it was a a sold out tiny event like that that's yeah it's too easy to feel i mean we
[03:41:35.360 --> 03:41:39.280]  could do that i mean that's that's ridiculous oh yeah and that's what she does that's what she does
[03:41:39.280 --> 03:41:44.080]  you know cnn fox news all these guys you know the report that cnn event or uh hillary clinton event
[03:41:44.080 --> 03:41:48.320]  was completely filled packed with a brim left tons of people waiting outside around the corner
[03:41:48.320 --> 03:41:52.480]  no they did that on purpose to make it look that way yeah yeah of course you can also position
[03:41:52.480 --> 03:41:56.720]  your cameras to where you only show people you don't show the empty seats that's the other thing
[03:41:56.720 --> 03:42:01.680]  they like to do as well well joe you're going to be giving us some coverage tonight for the
[03:42:01.680 --> 03:42:05.760]  live election coverage have you been to any of the polling places yet and talk to anybody
[03:42:05.760 --> 03:42:10.480]  i'm going to be coming up i'm going to be at the bernie sanders event tonight where he's speaking
[03:42:10.480 --> 03:42:15.920]  in santa monica uh that's in uh east or west la out that way so i'm going to be at the actual
[03:42:15.920 --> 03:42:20.640]  event i have tickets and i will be out there reporting from there i have a team of uh people
[03:42:20.640 --> 03:42:24.880]  with me that'll be helping out and i know lee and and michael zimmerman will be going somewhere
[03:42:24.880 --> 03:42:28.880]  as well tonight okay that's interesting what do you think before you go uh what do you think about
[03:42:28.880 --> 03:42:32.640]  the bernie people i mean what do you think his strategy is in this because he clearly
[03:42:32.640 --> 03:42:37.760]  doesn't have the votes and at this point he's behind hillary even in the pledge delegates
[03:42:37.760 --> 03:42:42.480]  that he would get based on the election polling so even if you took the super delegates out he
[03:42:42.480 --> 03:42:46.720]  would be losing to hillary at this point i mean what what do you think his strategy is going forward
[03:42:48.720 --> 03:42:53.440]  at this point he knows he's he's lost but i think he's in it for the movement so to say
[03:42:53.440 --> 03:42:59.840]  you know he's he's been out here working hard and you see him he packs more people in his events
[03:42:59.840 --> 03:43:04.880]  than hillary does he has larger venues just like trump does and they both are a popular uh candidate
[03:43:04.880 --> 03:43:08.800]  hillary clinton's just using his trickery so it's going to be interesting tonight because
[03:43:08.800 --> 03:43:12.800]  like you said he's not going to give up he doesn't think it's over yet he says you know it's it's
[03:43:12.800 --> 03:43:17.360]  crazy that msnbc and you know the associated press all these people come out and go ahead and say
[03:43:17.360 --> 03:43:21.440]  that hillary has it when no one's even voted here yet so it'll be interesting to see what happens if
[03:43:21.440 --> 03:43:25.840]  they completely call it for or if there's going to be an uprise i don't know i mean but i know a
[03:43:25.840 --> 03:43:29.920]  lot of these bernie people even told me yesterday the hillary clinton event that they if i have to
[03:43:29.920 --> 03:43:34.800]  if it gets taken from bernie they will vote for trump well you know he has flipped a couple of
[03:43:34.800 --> 03:43:40.800]  superdelegates one just flipped in north carolina the problem i see with him trying to sell it is
[03:43:40.800 --> 03:43:45.120]  because uh most of these superdelegates are career politicians and they're going to stick their
[03:43:45.120 --> 03:43:49.520]  finger in the air and see which way the wind is blowing and unless there is a massive movement
[03:43:49.520 --> 03:43:54.080]  in one direction where they all jump ship at the same time i don't really see a massive movement
[03:43:54.080 --> 03:43:59.840]  doing that especially when she has not the majority of the delegates but the plurality of the delegates
[03:43:59.840 --> 03:44:04.080]  i think it's going to be a hard case for him i'm kind of thinking joe that he's hanging in there
[03:44:04.080 --> 03:44:11.200]  just in case uh she gets indicted uh that may be hoping that they will uh back off and uh abandon
[03:44:11.200 --> 03:44:15.120]  her at that point that he can try to make that case uh there but i don't think the democrats
[03:44:15.120 --> 03:44:18.960]  leave him back away from her the professional democrats and many of the supporters i don't
[03:44:18.960 --> 03:44:23.280]  even think they'll back away from her if she's indicted they still supported uh bill clinton when
[03:44:23.280 --> 03:44:28.960]  he was impeached for perjury and and that's the thing we need to understand he was not impeached
[03:44:28.960 --> 03:44:34.160]  because he had an affair he was impeached because he committed perjury he's a lawyer and a sitting
[03:44:34.160 --> 03:44:39.920]  president he swore on oath at a trial about something it was proven to be a liar they didn't
[03:44:39.920 --> 03:44:43.680]  even come after him on the rape charges but they showed that he was a perjurer so i don't think even
[03:44:43.680 --> 03:44:48.160]  if they indict hillary clinton i don't think that the the democrats are going to abandon her at that
[03:44:48.160 --> 03:44:52.320]  point what do you think yeah i agree with you completely you know i think he's going to stick
[03:44:52.320 --> 03:44:55.840]  it out and we'll see what happens but you know when you go to these events and you actually
[03:44:55.840 --> 03:44:59.520]  stand and talk to people who support hillary clinton there's a whole lot of people out there
[03:44:59.520 --> 03:45:03.040]  with the same viewpoint what difference does it make when you bring up the emails when you bring
[03:45:03.040 --> 03:45:08.000]  up in gauze when you bring up all of you know the connections the the clinton clash uh cash the
[03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:12.160]  the crime family syndicate that they have you know they're like a team they're like a mobster team
[03:45:12.160 --> 03:45:16.800]  you know the the deaths that they're you know connected to it's ridiculous and these people
[03:45:16.800 --> 03:45:21.120]  just kind of scoff they go you know whatever you know she's she's a woman i'm ready for a woman
[03:45:21.120 --> 03:45:25.680]  we just had a black president now it's time for a woman completely not even looking at who she is
[03:45:25.680 --> 03:45:29.520]  as a person and what she's going to do to the country people are just voting because it's a
[03:45:29.520 --> 03:45:33.680]  woman they want a woman it's time for change it's time for us to be progressive and move on
[03:45:33.680 --> 03:45:39.120]  and ignore the facts yeah yeah i think uh i think he really lost his opportunity he could have
[03:45:39.120 --> 03:45:43.200]  come out not only as being an authentic candidate which he does come across as he authentically
[03:45:43.200 --> 03:45:47.440]  believes in socialism which i totally disagree with our mom but he is authentic i mean he has
[03:45:47.440 --> 03:45:53.200]  been consistent with what he believes in over the years and i think he completely lost his
[03:45:53.200 --> 03:45:56.880]  opportunity to take her out because he could have taken the moral high ground when he said in one of
[03:45:56.880 --> 03:46:02.800]  the early debates uh i'm sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails he was done at that point
[03:46:02.800 --> 03:46:07.520]  i think and uh we've seen this from other candidates now at this point as well but it'll be interesting
[03:46:07.520 --> 03:46:10.880]  to see what happens we'll be covering it tonight and of course uh you're going to be there at a
[03:46:10.880 --> 03:46:15.120]  bernie sanders rally we're going to have uh joe biggs in california at the bernie sanders rally
[03:46:15.120 --> 03:46:20.720]  we'll also have leon macadoo uh also reporting from california and we'll have our reporters
[03:46:20.720 --> 03:46:25.360]  uh in new jersey as well richard rees will be there in new jersey talking to people
[03:46:25.360 --> 03:46:30.000]  about what's going on because there's an election all across the country from the east coast to the
[03:46:30.000 --> 03:46:36.880]  west coast tonight thank you so much joe thank you all right now as we went to the break at the
[03:46:36.880 --> 03:46:42.560]  bottom of the hour talking about what the epa did in this colorado town how they blew up this gold
[03:46:42.560 --> 03:46:49.280]  mine so they could turn the place into a super fun and now the people after 25 years 2025 years of
[03:46:49.280 --> 03:46:54.480]  fighting the epa who wanted to take over their town and turn it into a super fun the epa came in
[03:46:55.200 --> 03:47:01.520]  and through incredible malfeasance that was exposed by engineers ahead of time said they're
[03:47:01.520 --> 03:47:07.280]  going to create an environmental catastrophe here and get the super fun that they've been
[03:47:07.280 --> 03:47:13.920]  after for a long time they did it they blew up nearly a million pounds of toxic metals lead
[03:47:13.920 --> 03:47:20.320]  arsenic other heavy metals polluted this river through three states and the navajo nation and
[03:47:20.320 --> 03:47:25.920]  now they've got their super fun now keep that in mind keep that in mind as we look at this
[03:47:25.920 --> 03:47:31.760]  washington post story this came out over the weekend via drudge i saw it a major native american
[03:47:31.760 --> 03:47:39.760]  site is being looted will obama risk armed confrontation to save it this is pure propaganda
[03:47:39.760 --> 03:47:46.000]  folks this is the washington post that their standards have sunk to levels that are totally
[03:47:46.000 --> 03:47:52.800]  unprecedented before even for the establishment media and when i look at this headline here
[03:47:52.800 --> 03:47:59.360]  here okay the the native american site is being looted will obama risk armed confrontation with
[03:47:59.360 --> 03:48:04.800]  those cowboys to save the native american lands that's the the choice that they're putting out
[03:48:04.800 --> 03:48:11.920]  their force poor obama you know he's such a victim he just doesn't want to uh really intrude on anybody
[03:48:11.920 --> 03:48:17.520]  look i did a report with rob Jacobson and you can find it on the alex jones report the great
[03:48:17.520 --> 03:48:26.160]  american land grab and we talk about how obama is going nuts with this with his pen confiscating
[03:48:26.160 --> 03:48:31.120]  millions and millions of acres and of course this goes back to the 1906 antiquities act
[03:48:32.080 --> 03:48:38.000]  the 1906 antiquities act was set up to save native american sites and some other things
[03:48:38.000 --> 03:48:43.440]  and of course they were able to get the devil's tower you know and and only four acres to save
[03:48:43.440 --> 03:48:50.240]  that entire site only four acres was needed to do that and yet what obama is doing is he's going in
[03:48:50.240 --> 03:48:58.320]  and with a stroke of a pen confiscating millions of land acres of land and when i say confiscating
[03:48:58.320 --> 03:49:02.160]  this is land that the federal government says that it owns and we can have that agreement
[03:49:02.160 --> 03:49:07.200]  disagreement as to whether or not they really own it because of the constitution and i'm not going to
[03:49:07.200 --> 03:49:12.880]  get into that we've talked about that in the past but the issue is this as the government said okay
[03:49:12.880 --> 03:49:18.640]  we own these lands and we're going to manage it for you that's what blm the m and blm stands for
[03:49:18.640 --> 03:49:24.000]  is management okay the bureau of land management but they don't want to manage it they want to
[03:49:24.000 --> 03:49:28.560]  confiscate the property rights of people who are there and we're not saying that the bundes or
[03:49:28.560 --> 03:49:35.680]  these ranchers own the property that's never been said what they own are things like surface grazing
[03:49:35.680 --> 03:49:44.640]  rights water rights mineral rights lumber rights these are property rights every much uh as as your
[03:49:44.640 --> 03:49:50.720]  property rights the deed of your home and if they can take this from them they can take anything from
[03:49:50.720 --> 03:49:55.840]  you even though you're not a rancher a miner a logger if they can steal this from these people
[03:49:55.840 --> 03:50:01.520]  many of them have had this for 150 years this is property that they've owned that they've sold
[03:50:01.520 --> 03:50:06.560]  and they take their property rights and say we're doing it to protect the indians and we go in that
[03:50:06.560 --> 03:50:11.200]  video i'm not going to go back and play that video take a look at that you've got harry reid
[03:50:11.920 --> 03:50:17.040]  showing pictures of some petroglyphs and saying look people defaced it well where's your blm
[03:50:17.040 --> 03:50:22.480]  where's your wonderful uh police state managers out there the guys with the guns and the military
[03:50:22.480 --> 03:50:29.120]  hardware they can't protect these small areas with these precious petroglyphs put cameras around it
[03:50:29.120 --> 03:50:34.480]  station guards on it no it's not about protecting that stuff and this is fundamentally dishonest
[03:50:34.480 --> 03:50:39.360]  from the washington post and that goes to a story that i want to talk about when jeff bezos
[03:50:40.000 --> 03:50:45.440]  went in and and talked this last week of the recode conference uh at mosburg and he was talking
[03:50:45.440 --> 03:50:50.240]  about a lot of different things everybody focused on his comments and his conflict with donald trump
[03:50:50.880 --> 03:50:55.680]  because donald trump called him out on the washington post he said he bought that for a song
[03:50:55.680 --> 03:51:00.160]  and it is a song to a billionaire he bought that for a song it is political leverage and
[03:51:00.160 --> 03:51:05.200]  want to talk about how he's leveraging it when we come back my name is don whiskin and at 42 years

[03:55:17.760 --> 03:55:22.160]  research i take a look at it and so i take these like say a multivitamin for example
[03:55:22.160 --> 03:55:26.720]  multivitamin for example when i take a multivitamin i don't necessarily feel anything but i know that
[03:55:26.720 --> 03:55:30.480]  it's good for me i can look and see what the ingredients are on that but when you see some
[03:55:30.480 --> 03:55:36.080]  things like brain force that really does help me to focus my mind that is available at info

[03:56:18.640 --> 03:56:25.200]  as for us and we do appreciate your support now as i was talking about this washington post story
[03:56:25.200 --> 03:56:30.720]  and i said this is pure propaganda this is what they're doing to the uh the people out there trying
[03:56:30.720 --> 03:56:36.400]  to take their property rights saying that obama is going to have to risk an armed confrontation
[03:56:36.400 --> 03:56:41.200]  with them this is essentially what the washington posted with donald trump remember that piece of
[03:56:41.200 --> 03:56:45.840]  low life journalism so in the worst journalism i've ever seen where they took the remarks of
[03:56:45.840 --> 03:56:51.360]  women out of context they implied motivations and drew conclusions for these women women who
[03:56:51.360 --> 03:56:56.880]  refuse to be interviewed by them they took quotes out of context from her book refused to put in
[03:56:56.880 --> 03:57:02.400]  quotes that were favorable to donald trump trying to portray him as a sexual predator and so now
[03:57:02.400 --> 03:57:09.680]  we see the same type of agenda with a washington post and this last week when jeff bezos was at
[03:57:09.680 --> 03:57:13.120]  the recode conference he talked about a lot of different issues i want to talk a little bit about
[03:57:13.120 --> 03:57:17.680]  the space issue but but first of all understand what's going on with the washington post spent
[03:57:17.680 --> 03:57:22.080]  250 million dollars for this and it's not much money to somebody's got a lot as much money as
[03:57:22.640 --> 03:57:28.400]  as jeff bezos does and it gives him a tremendous amount of leverage in that conference he said i
[03:57:28.400 --> 03:57:34.160]  bought this small paper which is basically a colloquial paper now who in their right mind would
[03:57:34.160 --> 03:57:38.400]  say the washington post was a colloquial paper it's a national paper just like the new york times
[03:57:38.400 --> 03:57:44.880]  or the la times or whatever he says i'm going to turn it into a global paper i'm going to do that
[03:57:44.880 --> 03:57:49.120]  with my money with that's my business plan to do that well really his business plan
[03:57:49.760 --> 03:57:55.040]  is to push through favors for himself and regulation and let me give you an example of this as i
[03:57:55.040 --> 03:58:02.560]  pointed out in this and now i'm out of time i did this report talking about how we're at the moment
[03:58:02.560 --> 03:58:08.720]  here where billionaires are moving into space just as we have seen in the movie elysium for example
[03:58:08.720 --> 03:58:13.680]  as we talked with hugo de garis about the art alike wars essential part of this it's even more
[03:58:13.680 --> 03:58:20.160]  difficult to escape the regulatory reach of the government than it is to escape the gravity of
[03:58:20.160 --> 03:58:25.840]  the earth that's what happened this last weekend they're changing the regulations for the private
[03:58:25.840 --> 03:58:30.960]  confiscation of space take a look at that report billionaire space race prepper bug out or global
