[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:30.000 --> 00:45.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, there has been testimony in Congress that I can tell you from our deep
[00:45.360 --> 00:54.200]  research is 100% on target by a top psychologist and computer science expert that Google is
[00:54.200 --> 00:59.960]  already stealing the 2020 election and will give it to the Democrats.
[00:59.960 --> 01:03.120]  Now there are ways to counter this, but action must be taken.
[01:03.120 --> 01:09.360]  We're going to play large sections of his testimony coming up here today.
[01:09.360 --> 01:13.240]  Dr. Robert Epstein.
[01:13.240 --> 01:14.240]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14.240 --> 01:16.640]  Here is a two minute boil down.
[01:16.640 --> 01:25.040]  Google's manipulation of votes gave at least 2.6 million additional votes to Hillary Clinton
[01:25.040 --> 01:26.440]  in the year 2016.
[01:26.440 --> 01:27.440]  Is that correct?
[01:27.440 --> 01:31.960]  2.6 million is a rock bottom minimum.
[01:31.960 --> 01:39.800]  The range is between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes, depending on how aggressive they were
[01:39.800 --> 01:43.000]  in using the techniques that I've been setting.
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.560]  They control these and no one can counteract them.
[01:47.560 --> 01:50.080]  These are not competitive.
[01:50.080 --> 01:55.920]  These are tools that they have at their disposal exclusively.
[01:55.920 --> 02:04.560]  Your testimony is that Google is, through bias in search results, manipulating voters
[02:04.560 --> 02:06.200]  in a way they're not aware of.
[02:06.200 --> 02:12.960]  On a massive scale, in 2020, if all these companies are supporting the same candidate,
[02:12.960 --> 02:18.560]  there are 15 million votes on the line that can be shifted without people's knowledge
[02:18.560 --> 02:23.200]  and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace.
[02:23.200 --> 02:27.760]  Without monitoring systems in place, we'll never know what these companies are doing.
[02:27.760 --> 02:36.760]  And in 2020, you can bet that all of these companies are going to go all out, and the
[02:36.760 --> 02:43.760]  methods that they're using are invisible, they're subliminal, they're more powerful
[02:43.760 --> 02:48.120]  than most any effects I've ever seen in the behavioral sciences, and I've been in the
[02:48.120 --> 02:50.280]  behavioral sciences for almost 40 years.
[02:50.280 --> 02:56.400]  A handful of Silicon Valley billionaires and giant corporations are able to spend millions
[02:56.400 --> 03:05.360]  of dollars, if not billions of dollars, collectively, massively influencing the results of elections.
[03:05.360 --> 03:08.040]  Senator, with respect, I must correct you.
[03:08.040 --> 03:12.960]  If Mark Zuckerberg chooses to send out a go vote reminder just to Democrats on election
[03:12.960 --> 03:16.440]  day, that doesn't cost him a dime.
[03:16.440 --> 03:20.520]  So ladies and gentlemen, that's an important little boil down, but it should probably have
[03:20.520 --> 03:23.080]  war drums or air raid sirens.
[03:23.080 --> 03:27.840]  So we're going to re-release that video with air raid sirens.
[03:27.840 --> 03:33.800]  Because foreign armies couldn't conquer this country, but AI is conquering it, and big
[03:33.800 --> 03:37.360]  tech knows exactly what they're doing.
[03:37.360 --> 03:43.140]  So I'm going to air his testimony, his prepared statements, and some of the most important
[03:43.140 --> 03:47.840]  questions throughout the first hour today.
[03:47.840 --> 03:54.280]  And do I need to remind listeners on my knees, begging you for your children, my children,
[03:54.280 --> 03:58.880]  to tell everyone how you're listening on AM and FM, to tell everyone how you're listening
[03:58.880 --> 04:03.240]  on the Internet, and to share the link, say, here is the forbidden broadcast.
[04:03.240 --> 04:08.200]  Here is what the top Democrats have hearings about just this week saying we must shut him
[04:08.200 --> 04:10.840]  down or we will be defeated.
[04:10.840 --> 04:13.520]  It's because I know their battle plans.
[04:13.520 --> 04:15.240]  I read their white papers.
[04:15.240 --> 04:16.240]  They're not used to that.
[04:16.240 --> 04:17.440]  And it's like I'm in their boardrooms.
[04:17.440 --> 04:19.520]  I'm in their head.
[04:19.520 --> 04:21.320]  You're in their head.
[04:21.320 --> 04:23.600]  I told you China was running Google.
[04:23.600 --> 04:25.120]  It's all over the news now.
[04:25.120 --> 04:27.560]  It's espionage.
[04:27.560 --> 04:29.480]  Same thing with Apple.
[04:29.480 --> 04:31.880]  Infowars.com for its last show.
[04:31.880 --> 04:33.560]  Now here's the even bigger news.
[04:33.560 --> 04:39.240]  What's the headline on Infowars.com for the broadcast today?
[04:39.240 --> 04:43.920]  AI takeover of humanity now underway.
[04:43.920 --> 04:50.920]  Elon Musk has announced this year the rollout of consumer brain ships at consumer brain
[04:50.920 --> 04:53.080]  ship facilities.
[04:53.080 --> 05:01.160]  Millions are about to get brain ships to be able to access devices.
[05:01.160 --> 05:05.160]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're
[05:05.160 --> 05:08.800]  going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago
[05:08.800 --> 05:11.960]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would
[05:11.960 --> 05:15.360]  talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and
[05:15.360 --> 05:17.960]  I'd have doctors on an expert to explain why they were so good.
[05:17.960 --> 05:21.280]  And instead the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll
[05:21.280 --> 05:22.280]  shut us down.
[05:22.280 --> 05:24.640]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[05:24.640 --> 05:25.640]  wonderful they were.
[05:25.640 --> 05:27.440]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[05:27.440 --> 05:31.760]  Jones sells unapproved supplements and he claims their supplements.
[05:31.760 --> 05:37.120]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the
[05:37.120 --> 05:39.640]  FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[05:39.640 --> 05:42.360]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[05:42.360 --> 05:46.120]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate
[05:46.120 --> 05:47.120]  it and do different things.
[05:47.120 --> 05:48.440]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[05:48.440 --> 05:52.360]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[05:52.360 --> 05:54.000]  God's medicine chest.
[05:54.000 --> 06:11.960]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going
[06:11.960 --> 06:20.000]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[06:20.000 --> 06:39.160]  End lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones, Elon Musk in the last three years tried
[06:39.160 --> 06:47.000]  to go public about the plan for world government, about the plan for brain chips, he warned
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.640]  everyone that they plan to hook you into a giant AI system that tracks and controls
[06:51.640 --> 06:58.040]  your every movement and manipulates you with psychological stimulus to control your life.
[06:58.040 --> 07:01.800]  Science fiction, it is the year 2019.
[07:01.800 --> 07:06.440]  And revelation is beginning to come through, casual societies are rolling in, world governments
[07:06.440 --> 07:13.320]  being announced, major universities are banning the term America, saying it's a hate word.
[07:13.320 --> 07:21.080]  The word manhole is being banned by major cities, again, this is total cult-like control.
[07:21.080 --> 07:27.240]  Facebook is saying that they will allow users to promote violence and murder of conservatives.
[07:27.240 --> 07:32.320]  And Elon Musk comes out and announces, oh, there's a big brain interface announcement
[07:32.320 --> 07:33.320]  I'm going to make.
[07:33.320 --> 07:39.440]  And when he makes the announcement, it's almost no fanfare, super creepy.
[07:39.440 --> 07:48.320]  And he says that, oh, you're going to have a brain chip, but they call it a neurolink.
[07:48.320 --> 07:55.200]  Brain reading threads, they're not wires into your brain, they're threads.
[07:55.200 --> 08:01.040]  Oh, and don't criticize people that have chosen to become transhuman, see they're teaching
[08:01.040 --> 08:07.760]  us with training wheels that if an obese giant man wants to go compete against women in power
[08:07.760 --> 08:11.760]  lifting and win, that he's really a woman.
[08:11.760 --> 08:17.680]  And DARPA admits the corrupt people at DARPA that are running this at the top admitted
[08:17.680 --> 08:22.320]  back in the 90s that they were going to do this so that when it's in cyborgs and human
[08:22.320 --> 08:27.520]  clones and humanoids that have, you know, five dads, you go, why would you have five
[08:27.520 --> 08:28.520]  dads?
[08:28.520 --> 08:32.840]  Well, five gay men get together, it's cute to not have any women involved.
[08:32.840 --> 08:36.520]  You said that doesn't make any sense, it's not meant to make sense.
[08:36.520 --> 08:43.120]  It's meant to tag the abomination desolation of our genetics and the destruction of humanity
[08:43.120 --> 08:49.040]  as a lifestyle change or what color you paint your house or what color you paint your nails
[08:49.040 --> 08:56.280]  or if you shave your butt or not, or whether you like, you know, chicken or fish at dinner.
[08:56.280 --> 08:58.920]  You understand they've already made humanoids in China and of course they've made them
[08:58.920 --> 09:04.600]  here that have five fathers, five mothers, it's not a human.
[09:04.600 --> 09:08.680]  Genetics don't splice.
[09:08.680 --> 09:09.680]  It's pure evil.
[09:09.680 --> 09:14.280]  And so I feel like we ought to have a drum roll.
[09:14.280 --> 09:19.640]  Can we play the classic Fox intro, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, with the spotlights
[09:19.640 --> 09:25.080]  and everything because this is a big deal, said it'll be the four horsemen of the apocalypse
[09:25.080 --> 09:30.160]  riding over the hill, Elon Musk, who warned of all this suddenly looking like he has a
[09:30.160 --> 09:39.480]  gun to his head, we'll play the video in a moment, comes out and says by 2020 we're
[09:39.480 --> 09:45.400]  going to roll it up consumer level, you're going to be augmented, it's going to be wonderful
[09:45.400 --> 09:46.880]  and then they get into the surgery.
[09:46.880 --> 09:47.880]  It's so easy.
[09:47.880 --> 09:54.160]  It's a laser, not a scalpel and the laser shoots a hole in the back of your head.
[09:54.160 --> 10:00.560]  It's a quick procedure and then we put wires into your brain.
[10:00.560 --> 10:03.880]  But you see, it's like a roll out of a new iPhone.
[10:03.880 --> 10:09.600]  You know, iPhone's revolutionized things, air conditioning did, the television did,
[10:09.600 --> 10:16.360]  red alert, AI takeover now underway, Elon Musk announces brain ships for all.
[10:16.360 --> 10:24.040]  It's not like Chevy announcing, hey, we've got a new cargo type door and on our new truck
[10:24.040 --> 10:34.520]  or, oh, we've got a new special latching system with the trailer hitch or something with the
[10:34.520 --> 10:35.520]  tailgate.
[10:35.520 --> 10:36.520]  It's like, oh, really?
[10:36.520 --> 10:41.400]  Oh, yeah, there's a new center down the street, you know, Elon Musk and all your fancy malls
[10:41.400 --> 10:46.000]  has a little Tesla center and he announces in a long, rambling 30 minute announcement
[10:46.000 --> 10:50.040]  that you'll just go to the mall, see, it's got to be easy and you just go in like you're
[10:50.040 --> 10:53.680]  getting your ears pierced or something and it's going to be all the rage and the kids
[10:53.680 --> 10:58.080]  on YouTube that have it and all the girls will want to date you because it's so cool
[10:58.080 --> 11:02.920]  to go run off a cliff and it's this hype driven evil society that pulled his Beto
[11:02.920 --> 11:05.480]  or Rourke was the second coming of Christ.
[11:05.480 --> 11:10.400]  Now he's pulling at zero, you know, the first thumb scanners to get in your car were on
[11:10.400 --> 11:13.080]  Mercedes Benz 20 years ago.
[11:13.080 --> 11:15.120]  They make the digital enslavement cool.
[11:15.120 --> 11:16.200]  They make it stylish.
[11:16.200 --> 11:19.160]  They trick you to opt into it.
[11:19.160 --> 11:26.120]  And so when you read all these articles, Elon Musk unveils Neuralinks plans for brain reading
[11:26.120 --> 11:32.760]  threads and robot to insert them and it shows the woman, she just looks like a little hearing
[11:32.760 --> 11:36.480]  aid except it goes into your brain and the laser does it.
[11:36.480 --> 11:37.480]  It's so easy.
[11:37.480 --> 11:41.800]  It's like a science fiction movie where the aliens get you and, you know, put it right
[11:41.800 --> 11:45.000]  in your brainstem, but that's okay.
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.320]  What was that movie invaders from Mars in the eighties where, you know, the kid finds
[11:50.320 --> 11:54.320]  out that the aliens have landed in his backyard and a burrowed in or grabbing, you know, his
[11:54.320 --> 11:57.200]  parents and people and they put a chip right in the back of your neck.
[11:57.200 --> 11:59.560]  But that's, that's a horror movie.
[11:59.560 --> 12:05.680]  This is, oh my gosh, it's such a trendy, oh, oh, don't talk bad about the people that
[12:05.680 --> 12:06.680]  did it.
[12:06.680 --> 12:07.680]  Don't say they're losers.
[12:07.680 --> 12:11.240]  They're trans, transhuman.
[12:11.240 --> 12:15.680]  Julian Huxley, all this Huxley's brother, headed up the UN, UNESCO program, that's really
[12:15.680 --> 12:20.880]  the UN, the Global Sanitization Program, and he headed up the World Eugenics Society.
[12:20.880 --> 12:24.480]  And after Hitler, it made him look bad, so he said, we're not going to be on his transhumanists.
[12:24.480 --> 12:28.440]  Oh, you think, oh, it'll be so cool, all merged with machines.
[12:28.440 --> 12:31.680]  So, so here's the thing, Elon Musk came out and said all this was evil.
[12:31.680 --> 12:32.680]  Watch out for AI.
[12:32.680 --> 12:39.080]  But now looking like he has a gun to his head, he says the best part is once you have your
[12:39.080 --> 12:40.080]  neural thread.
[12:40.080 --> 12:45.040]  It's not a, it is a chip, it is wires, but that, that, the Christians in the Bible and
[12:45.040 --> 12:47.440]  everybody told us this for thousands of years.
[12:47.440 --> 12:50.720]  So let's not call it those names.
[12:50.720 --> 12:53.240]  It's a thread.
[12:53.240 --> 12:57.280]  And I'm sure California will pass a law that if you don't use the word thread, because
[12:57.280 --> 13:02.800]  you know, PKD said wire heads, oh, that's a pejorative, that's like inward.
[13:02.800 --> 13:04.240]  Don't you say that.
[13:04.240 --> 13:05.720]  No one has chips.
[13:05.720 --> 13:06.720]  They have augmentation.
[13:06.720 --> 13:12.200]  And if you want to be able to interface with the new apps, that's just how it is.
[13:12.200 --> 13:13.200]  You have to have it.
[13:13.200 --> 13:14.880]  Our soldiers have had it for years.
[13:14.880 --> 13:15.880]  Our astronauts.
[13:15.880 --> 13:16.880]  Oh, yes.
[13:16.880 --> 13:17.880]  Oh, yes.
[13:17.880 --> 13:18.880]  A lot of soldiers have it.
[13:18.880 --> 13:20.440]  Told you that 10 years ago.
[13:20.440 --> 13:23.560]  So if you want to be in special operations, you're going to get the chip.
[13:23.560 --> 13:26.040]  Now, go ahead and embrace it.
[13:26.040 --> 13:27.200]  But who controls the chip?
[13:27.200 --> 13:33.160]  Here's Elon Musk telling us how much fun it is, here it is.
[13:33.160 --> 13:40.840]  Elon Musk has developed electric cars with Tesla and sent rockets to space and back with
[13:40.840 --> 13:42.040]  SpaceX.
[13:42.040 --> 13:45.880]  But now he's taking on what may be the real final frontier.
[13:45.880 --> 13:49.280]  We can do a full brain machine interface.
[13:49.280 --> 13:54.760]  Combining man and machine with a new technology dubbed Noralink, which would allow data to
[13:54.760 --> 13:58.000]  be transmitted between humans and computers.
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.000]  Here's how it works.
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.200]  An array of tiny threads, only a tenth as big as a human hair, embedded with thousands
[14:04.200 --> 14:08.720]  of electrodes, is inserted into the brain by a robotic device.
[14:08.720 --> 14:14.000]  The threads are connected to a chip that transmits back and forth to an external receiver.
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.000]  The interface to the chip is wireless.
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.360]  So you have no wires poking out of your head.
[14:21.360 --> 14:23.480]  Very, very important.
[14:23.480 --> 14:27.360]  So it's basically Bluetooth to your phone.
[14:27.360 --> 14:33.000]  Musk says Noralink may help the human brain cure diseases and even reverse paralysis.
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.000]  Eventually, it could be used to connect with external devices.
[14:37.000 --> 14:43.400]  With a high bandwidth brain machine interface, I think we can actually go along for the ride
[14:43.400 --> 14:47.880]  and we can effectively have the option of merging with AI.
[14:47.880 --> 14:50.280]  I think this is extremely important.
[14:50.280 --> 14:55.640]  Noralink claims the devices have been successfully implanted in rats and at least one monkey
[14:55.640 --> 14:58.920]  who is able to control a computer's brain.
[14:58.920 --> 15:04.160]  The company hopes to implant the first Noralink into a simulation by the end of the year.
[15:04.160 --> 15:07.840]  Analysts worried this technology could have unforeseen negative impacts.
[15:07.840 --> 15:14.080]  We aren't aware yet that the technology has gone in reverse, meaning that you can use
[15:14.080 --> 15:19.640]  some sort of external force to implant thoughts or something else.
[15:19.640 --> 15:20.640]  Let's hit pause.
[15:20.640 --> 15:27.760]  I'm going to come back with more of this, but you understand, folks, that this is all
[15:27.760 --> 15:32.120]  being done to take over society and civilization and you're going to be made to have this to
[15:32.120 --> 15:34.280]  get on a bus or train to have a job.
[15:34.280 --> 15:36.640]  And it's all about controlling you.
[15:36.640 --> 15:41.360]  And it's all about, and when we come back, I'm going to play from MKUltra declassified
[15:41.360 --> 15:46.160]  documents, part of a documentary on this.
[15:46.160 --> 15:48.960]  So by the way, I was shown a facility at Bastrop.
[15:48.960 --> 15:52.680]  I told you this a hundred times with hundreds of monkeys who wires into their brains.
[15:52.680 --> 15:56.440]  Oh, but one monkey, we did it on one monkey.
[15:56.440 --> 16:00.080]  C-I-A, folks, we'll be right back.
[16:00.080 --> 16:06.000]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs, you now

[17:28.120 --> 17:30.080]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[17:30.080 --> 17:34.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[17:34.000 --> 17:35.520]  I sued the IRS and won.
[17:35.520 --> 17:38.480]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[17:38.480 --> 17:41.760]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[17:41.760 --> 17:44.040]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[17:44.040 --> 17:45.360]  I can help you too.
[17:45.360 --> 17:48.360]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[17:48.360 --> 17:50.560]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[18:00.440 --> 18:01.760]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[18:01.760 --> 18:02.760]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[18:02.760 --> 18:03.760]  Thanks for holding.
[18:03.760 --> 18:06.360]  Hey, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[18:06.360 --> 18:10.280]  I talk to a lot of people here in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that
[18:10.280 --> 18:12.480]  almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[18:12.480 --> 18:16.880]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[18:16.880 --> 18:21.160]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching
[18:21.160 --> 18:22.160]  2020.
[18:22.160 --> 18:23.160]  That's it.
[18:23.160 --> 18:25.240]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[18:25.240 --> 18:28.040]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[18:28.040 --> 18:29.360]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[18:29.360 --> 18:32.560]  I agree entirely and the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying
[18:32.560 --> 18:35.480]  to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[18:35.480 --> 18:38.400]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[18:38.400 --> 18:40.680]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[18:40.680 --> 18:43.880]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[18:43.880 --> 18:48.480]  You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others
[18:48.480 --> 18:49.480]  who are going to continue.
[18:49.480 --> 18:51.720]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War.
[18:51.720 --> 18:55.760]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten
[18:55.760 --> 19:22.600]  a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[19:22.600 --> 19:47.920]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War and we're going to keep fighting in the Info
[19:47.920 --> 19:48.920]  War.
[19:48.920 --> 20:05.400]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War.
[03:31.860 --> 20:41.480]  or something else inside of the brain.
[20:41.480 --> 20:44.200]  There are, like with anything else, there are downsides.
[20:44.200 --> 20:47.560]  Think about a hacker getting into a brain interface.
[20:47.560 --> 20:53.560]  Think about government control of people's brains, controlling what they think.
[20:53.560 --> 20:59.400]  Things like that are obviously a concern.
[20:59.400 --> 21:03.720]  From Star Wars to the Terminator, science fiction has long dreamt of merging humans
[21:03.720 --> 21:04.720]  with technology.
[21:04.720 --> 21:14.840]  But with rapidly evolving robots and artificial intelligence, what was once fiction is quickly
[21:14.840 --> 21:16.200]  becoming fact.
[21:16.200 --> 21:21.800]  As this technology evolves, the question may be, can we merge man and machine without
[21:21.800 --> 21:49.840]  losing some of our humanity, Jim Spellman, CGTN, Washington?
[21:49.840 --> 21:59.400]  Marketing with focus groups is already, it's now hard to believe, 18 years ago, I was allowed
[21:59.400 --> 22:08.560]  into the University of Texas psychology department by an individual that was friends with a movie
[22:08.560 --> 22:11.600]  director on it.
[22:11.600 --> 22:17.560]  And I had no idea that it was a big joke to him because he worked for the CIA, he worked
[22:17.560 --> 22:28.200]  for DARPA, he later went on to run major operations at MIT.
[22:28.200 --> 22:31.560]  He was a research scientist.
[22:31.560 --> 22:39.320]  And he would laugh at me when we went to dinner, we would drink beer and whiskey, he would
[22:39.320 --> 22:44.240]  smoke pot, I wouldn't smoke pot, but I mean I hung out with this fellow, I would contact
[22:44.240 --> 22:45.240]  him a lot.
[22:45.240 --> 22:48.800]  He was about 20 years older than me.
[22:48.800 --> 22:57.640]  So he was like 45 and I was like 25, I'm only 45 now.
[22:57.640 --> 23:03.280]  And he'd take me into these areas and he'd go, I don't tell anybody I ever took in here
[23:03.280 --> 23:06.440]  and there'd be a door and then another door and it would, you know, DARPA on the wall
[23:06.440 --> 23:11.320]  what the project was and those were all just control rooms to other things around University
[23:11.320 --> 23:19.240]  of Texas facilities in Galveston and Bastrop, Texas and San Antonio and all over.
[23:19.240 --> 23:25.520]  And you know, I look back in hindsight, you know, back then I was bashing Bush a lot.
[23:25.520 --> 23:33.640]  So he was what you'd call kind of a sadistic liberal.
[23:33.640 --> 23:38.200]  And now I look back on, you know, hanging out with him probably 30, 40 times or more.
[23:38.200 --> 23:43.440]  He was all a big joke because he obviously knew about all of it.
[23:43.440 --> 23:54.520]  And he, they had projects where women would just be paid to masturbate and watch TV ads
[23:54.520 --> 23:58.360]  that had subliminals at them.
[23:58.360 --> 24:04.440]  And I guess he gave me tours like three times and none of it was top secret.
[24:04.440 --> 24:09.520]  This is projects that had been top secret, they were now rolling out into beta test at
[24:09.520 --> 24:14.680]  the university.
[24:14.680 --> 24:21.280]  And you know, it was, it was stuff like cameras, hidden cameras that track your eye as you
[24:21.280 --> 24:27.360]  read products at Target or at Walmart.
[24:27.360 --> 24:31.560]  And then, you know, five years later you'd see it rolled out and it was put in stores.
[24:31.560 --> 24:34.880]  And he came in a room and he goes, you want to see this?
[24:34.880 --> 24:44.320]  He punches, he gets this look on his face, punches up the primate research facility.
[24:44.320 --> 24:46.760]  And it was something out of a science fiction movie.
[24:46.760 --> 24:52.440]  All these apes and all these monkeys, each in their own, in chairs with wires all running
[24:52.440 --> 24:56.040]  on their brains and TV screens flashing in front of their faces.
[24:56.040 --> 24:58.320]  And he said, oh, not supposed to see that.
[24:58.320 --> 24:59.320]  You didn't see that.
[24:59.320 --> 25:10.560]  I was like, oh, how's that for your, you know, your, your 51 Alex.
[25:10.560 --> 25:16.400]  And you know, I would talk about some of this type of stuff on air years later, and I was
[25:16.400 --> 25:18.760]  told by our mutual friend, he got irritated by it.
[25:18.760 --> 25:25.160]  But then my answer was, why the hell did you show me all this stuff?
[25:25.160 --> 25:29.520]  But that's just the University of Texas.
[25:29.520 --> 25:35.480]  I happen to know that UT manufactured LSD and distributed all over the country in the
[25:35.480 --> 25:36.480]  1960s.
[25:36.480 --> 25:40.640]  I happen to know they distribute synthetic drugs out of the University of Texas.
[25:40.640 --> 25:43.440]  I know what professors do and all about it.
[25:43.440 --> 25:45.640]  It's, it's, it's not even hidden folks.
[25:45.640 --> 25:56.720]  This whole country is a giant armed Manhattan project mad scientist lunatic asylum.
[25:56.720 --> 25:59.960]  And Trump is trying to get control of it and trying to dial out of it back.
[25:59.960 --> 26:04.560]  But quite frankly, it's 74 years old or whatever, 73.
[26:04.560 --> 26:06.080]  Trump doesn't get a lot of it.
[26:06.080 --> 26:09.680]  And that's why they're trying to keep him away from all of it.
[26:09.680 --> 26:20.680]  And from all these projects is because this stuff is serious.
[26:20.680 --> 26:24.160]  So when you see movies like the Kingsman, where the rich billionaire activates a wavelength
[26:24.160 --> 26:31.080]  transmitter, flicker rate on a cell phone to make people become violent and hateful and
[26:31.080 --> 26:34.560]  to make people fight with each other.
[26:34.560 --> 26:40.600]  It's declassified MK ultra documents from the 60s.
[26:40.600 --> 26:46.040]  And I've got mainstream news, wired magazine, mind control by cell phone right here.
[26:46.040 --> 26:48.480]  This is old.
[26:48.480 --> 26:54.840]  But to really get control, they need those wires into the brain.
[26:54.840 --> 27:01.120]  And wires are much worse than a chip, obviously, the chips just to transceiver and limited.
[27:01.120 --> 27:03.120]  This is a plug into your brain.
[27:03.120 --> 27:04.680]  Oh, you want brain tumors?
[27:04.680 --> 27:07.000]  You think cell phones give you brain tumors?
[27:07.000 --> 27:10.800]  Guaranteed Elon Musk's device will give you brain tumors bigger than Dallas.
[27:10.800 --> 27:16.000]  And you look at Musk, did he always talk about worrying about AIs and brain chips so we trust
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.000]  him subliminally?
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.320]  So then when he announces it, oh, we'll get it from him.
[27:20.320 --> 27:26.240]  He's either super ultra evil or he's been compromised as a gun to his head, but it doesn't
[27:26.240 --> 27:27.800]  really matter, does it?
[27:27.800 --> 27:30.720]  Oh, Elon Musk, the trendy.
[27:30.720 --> 27:35.960]  Oh, oh, let me get my brain chip.
[27:35.960 --> 27:39.400]  So the big announcement is a brain chip, they implant your head.
[27:39.400 --> 27:43.160]  But that's not the only AI takeover.
[27:43.160 --> 27:48.160]  Google brags on their own patents, their own admissions, their own quarterly reports
[27:48.160 --> 27:51.640]  to their shareholders.
[27:51.640 --> 27:53.320]  I have shareholders that send me the reports.
[27:53.320 --> 27:58.520]  That's how we knew that in 2005, they were listening to you over your computer and had
[27:58.520 --> 28:04.760]  AI artificial systems where if you have a dog barking, they would put dog food ads on
[28:04.760 --> 28:07.440]  or they heard you talk about your dog being sick.
[28:07.440 --> 28:13.520]  They would give you a local veterinary ad or remind you to eat your dog's inoculations.
[28:13.520 --> 28:21.400]  That was in the report sent to shareholders.
[28:21.400 --> 28:25.800]  But back then that was so un-American, so 1984, we had station managers call and say,
[28:25.800 --> 28:30.680]  we like Alex, but you know, the owners say we're going to have to drop him because there's
[28:30.680 --> 28:33.880]  no way Google's listening to you in your house.
[28:33.880 --> 28:36.400]  Now, they tell you.
[28:36.400 --> 28:37.400]  And their employees are.
[28:37.400 --> 28:41.040]  And so is Samsung, and so is Apple, and so is everybody else.
[28:41.040 --> 28:44.600]  This was all developed by DARPA scientists, the internet, all of it.
[28:44.600 --> 28:46.840]  It is a system to merge with machines.
[28:46.840 --> 28:50.160]  The AI gods must hold us to be wary of it.
[28:50.160 --> 28:54.160]  See, like a vampire, he's got to tell you it's evil, it's bad, don't take it, don't
[28:54.160 --> 28:59.240]  let me in, and now he's like, let me in.
[28:59.240 --> 29:03.800]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[29:03.800 --> 29:05.720]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[29:05.720 --> 29:07.480]  I had a problem like you once.
[29:07.480 --> 29:12.880]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[29:12.880 --> 29:14.000]  my life.
[29:14.000 --> 29:19.240]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[29:19.240 --> 29:24.440]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[29:24.440 --> 29:27.600]  you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[29:27.600 --> 29:32.280]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[29:32.280 --> 29:34.600]  and totally change your life.

[32:00.720 --> 32:04.640]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[32:04.640 --> 32:09.160]  The other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that
[32:09.160 --> 32:14.120]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire,
[32:14.120 --> 32:17.680]  that's not being funded by a secret foreign government, it is completely independent of
[32:17.680 --> 32:18.680]  all that.
[32:18.680 --> 32:23.920]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[32:23.920 --> 32:27.760]  and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[32:27.760 --> 32:32.120]  the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[32:32.120 --> 32:35.680]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era
[32:35.680 --> 32:39.520]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[32:39.520 --> 32:43.640]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to
[32:43.640 --> 32:48.240]  have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that, that they
[32:48.240 --> 32:52.960]  are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom
[32:52.960 --> 32:57.840]  and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming defamation, law
[32:57.840 --> 33:27.680]  and order and libel targeting youth.
[33:27.840 --> 33:43.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday, July 18, 2019
[33:43.360 --> 33:45.680]  global transmission.
[33:45.680 --> 33:53.520]  There are two ultra massive giant AI takeovers that are already well underway, the rollout
[33:53.520 --> 34:01.920]  of implantable microchips that are also hooked into a cabling systems so that you can be
[34:01.920 --> 34:11.000]  tracked, traced and also controlled, we have all of that news here for you.
[34:11.000 --> 34:18.120]  And then this other very important big piece of news that's so big, I'm going to go off
[34:18.120 --> 34:25.080]  the air for a while, I might just let stations know we're going to have dead air for 10 minutes.
[34:25.080 --> 34:32.200]  I'm serious, like if we got news that a giant 10 mile wide asteroid was going to basically
[34:32.200 --> 34:38.280]  destroy all human life on earth and that NASA had missed it and that it was going to hit
[34:38.280 --> 34:46.200]  in 30 minutes, can you imagine people jibbering and screaming over radio and TV and running
[34:46.200 --> 34:48.760]  around and jumping off cliffs or whatever?
[34:48.760 --> 34:54.640]  Or would you just get down your knees and pray or would you try to call your loved ones?
[34:54.640 --> 35:04.280]  Because you see, we've lost any sense of amazement, a lot of people have and a lot of people have
[35:04.280 --> 35:13.440]  lost any sense of caring about anything because people have had it good so long, but more
[35:13.440 --> 35:19.440]  than that, people have been entertained to death.
[35:19.440 --> 35:23.880]  And so we've all seen a thousand alien invasions, we've all seen a thousand asteroids at the
[35:23.880 --> 35:31.200]  earth, we've all seen zombie apocalypse hundreds of times, none of it was real, but our brain
[35:31.200 --> 35:36.760]  took it as real.
[35:36.760 --> 35:40.080]  You know, World War II veterans and people who'd seen a lot of violence, they would
[35:40.080 --> 35:45.280]  see violence in movies and say we don't want that on TV because it's not a laughing matter,
[35:45.280 --> 35:48.760]  it's not entertainment, it's not a joke, but people who've never seen real violence,
[35:48.760 --> 35:53.040]  well they think it's cute, they think it's funny to go to horror movies and see slasher
[35:53.040 --> 36:01.440]  films and see little kids kidnapped and eaten, it's exciting to them because they have no
[36:01.440 --> 36:07.560]  differential and that's why neurological disorders are exploding, one of the many reasons
[36:07.560 --> 36:14.520]  is there's big studies out that apathy leads to Alzheimer's.
[36:14.520 --> 36:19.400]  People just get set in their little safe ways and they never get outside their comfort zones
[36:19.400 --> 36:24.880]  and they begin to spiritually die.
[36:24.880 --> 36:30.760]  And so Elon Musk, the darling of the system with his, all his hyped up events, his spaceships
[36:30.760 --> 36:45.400]  and his Tesla overpriced cars and all the rest of it, he's now rolling out brain ships
[36:45.400 --> 37:06.080]  that by next year you'll just go, they're going to put ships on our kids brains and
[37:06.080 --> 37:09.600]  they're going to make it with a social credit score where if you get sterilized, you'll
[37:09.600 --> 37:16.560]  be given 20 years of free crap produced by robot factories and by the time you've sold
[37:16.560 --> 37:22.240]  out to that, you'll never even get 10 years of the money because they've got the algorithms
[37:22.240 --> 37:29.760]  and the social control and the systems to manipulate you until you then say, actually
[37:29.760 --> 37:35.520]  let me just be a superstar and be in Vegas for a year and then I agree and sign a contract
[37:35.520 --> 37:40.600]  to commit suicide and they'll have to be a big party on your block and everyone will
[37:40.600 --> 37:43.520]  say it's so good but you're doing for the earth, they'll give you some really great
[37:43.520 --> 37:50.280]  drugs, oh and I forgot the best part, then they'll upload your consciousness and so you
[37:50.280 --> 37:54.440]  really didn't die and now your consciousness will be better for the environment outside
[37:54.440 --> 37:55.440]  of your body.
[37:55.440 --> 37:58.760]  Of course it's not your consciousness, it's the biggest con game the planet in the world's
[37:58.760 --> 38:05.360]  ever seen and that's really where Elon Musk will be within five years, mark my words,
[38:05.360 --> 38:11.280]  they'll have test case celebrities that are dying of cancer but have great minds that
[38:11.280 --> 38:18.400]  we need and so they're going to upload their consciousness, it is a fatal process, Musk
[38:18.400 --> 38:23.520]  has already told us but oh and the other companies tell us it's fatal too, that's the agreement
[38:23.520 --> 38:29.120]  with DARPA but you upload it all, it's a fatal process, it takes a few days, they're going
[38:29.120 --> 38:35.600]  to keep you comfortable and so you have the fatal process and so your body dies but you
[38:35.600 --> 38:45.120]  live forever in the silicon universe and it's got your voice print, it's got your face,
[38:45.120 --> 38:52.000]  it knows everything about you and so it can fool even your mother when you're talking
[38:52.000 --> 39:03.040]  to it and there'll be avatars, biological avatars where your wife that had cancer you
[39:03.040 --> 39:08.480]  love so much, well it'll be her young body when she was 25, not when she died at 50th
[39:08.480 --> 39:15.640]  of cancer and it'll be her, now she'll have silicon in her brain and it'll be a clone
[39:15.640 --> 39:22.040]  but because the AI that you're going to grow up with is going to watch you have sex and
[39:22.040 --> 39:30.640]  listen to everything, it'll copy her perfectly and so you'll get your 25 year old sweetheart
[39:30.640 --> 39:43.680]  back but there won't be that glint in the eye, oh and I forgot when the system gets ready
[39:43.680 --> 39:50.000]  and as all its humanoids in place, if they go down this avenue, they activate the system
[39:50.000 --> 39:55.680]  and your wife comes in with a butcher knife, the clone, when you're asleep and slits your
[39:55.680 --> 40:01.160]  throat and cuts your head off because humans are about five times stronger than we know
[40:01.160 --> 40:07.080]  we are, there's a governor's built into ourselves so if your wife wanted to, the humanoid clone,
[40:07.080 --> 40:15.800]  we could tear your head off, how about that? Zuckerberg just doesn't send out a notification
[40:15.800 --> 40:26.040]  to tell all the democrats to go vote against the republicans, oh no he sends out a notification
[40:26.040 --> 40:30.840]  for his armies of leftists to go out and kill you but he doesn't need them anymore you
[40:30.840 --> 40:36.400]  see because he's got all the robots and devices and machines and systems listening and all
[40:36.400 --> 40:45.840]  of it and sex clones, replicants that can tear your head right off your shoulders and
[40:45.840 --> 40:50.240]  they've already got those already, oh they've already got replicants, they've had clones,
[40:50.240 --> 41:07.000]  the Nazis had human clones, the British cloned rabbits in the 20s that we know of, it's so
[41:07.000 --> 41:16.320]  liberal, good girl take your brain chip, so this is very upsetting to me, am I just going
[41:16.320 --> 41:20.880]  to take this business as usual, you can say oh well a lot of people get help with brain
[41:20.880 --> 41:27.040]  chips, yeah I know, it's like a car can be a good thing till ISIS runs over you, it's
[41:27.040 --> 41:39.440]  who's driving it and this whole thing is being rolled out to end the human system and bring
[41:39.440 --> 41:47.200]  in the post-human era according to the UN, according to DARPA, according to the globalist,
[41:47.200 --> 41:52.680]  according to their own statements and then Elon Musk says beware of this, the leader
[41:52.680 --> 41:57.440]  planned to get rid of humanity and merge with machines and then they try to crash his company
[41:57.440 --> 42:01.400]  and suddenly he's like oh I love it, take brain chips, he was always planning it, this
[42:01.400 --> 42:08.440]  is a sophisticated psychological warfare system and he knows I'm the number one and number
[42:08.440 --> 42:12.720]  two, Joe just said it last week, it's true, number one and number two podcast in history
[42:12.720 --> 42:21.960]  are Alex Jones on Joe Rogan, so Elon Musk is PR people and all his CIA commando protectors,
[42:21.960 --> 42:28.080]  I'm good friends with one of them, they all know well that's the most popular thing,
[42:28.080 --> 42:36.000]  say you're Alex Jones, put on his skin, sickening, oh hey Elon, how's Jeffrey Epstein doing,
[42:36.000 --> 42:42.880]  he's talking about that, oh I haven't gotten into the big news yet, oh the 2020 elections
[42:42.880 --> 42:47.480]  lost, Trump lost, Trump's going to lose and they're just hoping he doesn't realize that
[42:47.480 --> 42:53.160]  he could stop it today but I'll tell you how Trump will lose 2020, I told you he would win,
[42:53.160 --> 42:58.680]  he will lose, currently on this space-time continuum timeline, Trump is losing.
[42:58.680 --> 43:08.680]  So the Info Wars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting
[43:08.680 --> 43:13.600]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[43:13.600 --> 43:19.240]  one another, it is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach,
[43:19.240 --> 43:24.000]  it is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.720]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what content
[43:28.720 --> 43:32.720]  goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices in
[43:32.720 --> 43:36.400]  supporting Info Wars and it's all because the audience spends there whatever it is,
[43:36.400 --> 43:40.760]  whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually
[43:40.760 --> 43:45.160]  compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time
[43:45.160 --> 43:49.760]  support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to
[43:49.760 --> 43:54.080]  see and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate American democratic expression
[43:54.080 --> 43:58.600]  and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[43:58.600 --> 44:05.280]  So there's going to be a social media summit here in DC tomorrow, of course Info Wars ground
[44:05.280 --> 44:09.920]  zero for the censorship, Alex Jones, patient zero for the censorship, doesn't even get
[44:09.920 --> 44:13.320]  an invite but that's fine, we'll play the dark night, we hope that there's other people
[44:13.320 --> 44:17.440]  there that will bring us up, bring Alex Jones up, bring some of the other band names like
[44:17.440 --> 44:22.880]  Gavin McGinnis and Milo Yiannopoulos and Laura Lumer up as well and they won't be bullied
[44:22.880 --> 44:27.160]  by some of the conservatives that like to censor those voices as well at the summit.
[44:27.160 --> 44:31.280]  But we'll see, I have a feeling this is just going to be throwing a dog a bone, patting
[44:31.280 --> 44:35.080]  him on the head and telling him to move on with his day but hopefully maybe disperse
[44:35.080 --> 44:40.440]  some action from Congress, from the President, from the White House to do something about
[44:40.440 --> 44:44.840]  the big tech censorship before the 2020 elections when it's going to be so key.
[44:44.840 --> 44:49.400]  It was Info Wars presence on social media that helped get Trump into the White House,
[44:49.400 --> 44:51.360]  that's why we are targeted.
[44:51.360 --> 44:55.200]  So let's see what happens at the social media summit 2019.
[44:55.200 --> 45:00.120]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[45:00.120 --> 45:05.480]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators, they are technocrats, they are
[45:05.480 --> 45:09.560]  control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[45:09.560 --> 45:15.000]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[45:15.000 --> 45:18.320]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[45:18.320 --> 45:22.840]  third dimension but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[45:22.840 --> 45:25.800]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[45:25.800 --> 45:31.080]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements for InfoWars.com, I couldn't do it.
[45:31.080 --> 45:35.440]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[45:35.440 --> 45:41.160]  and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[45:41.160 --> 45:46.040]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going
[45:46.040 --> 45:47.040]  to find anywhere.
[45:47.040 --> 45:52.200]  It is amazing, experience pure, Medica B12 for yourself and fund the second American
[45:52.200 --> 46:00.760]  evolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[46:00.760 --> 46:06.480]  Last night I'm on InfoWars.com and I read, Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice.
[46:06.480 --> 46:11.840]  It is literally the shirt that I envisioned, a Betsy Ross but also another just classic
[46:11.840 --> 46:17.520]  American flag all 50 stars, with the Gadsden Snake superimposed over it and on the back,
[46:17.520 --> 46:21.520]  America's back, InfoWars.com, but what's better than just an American flag about a don't
[46:21.520 --> 46:25.080]  tread on me under the flag, saying don't trail the American flag, it's a perfect combo.
[46:25.080 --> 46:28.120]  So great minds think alike, I mean whoever designed that shirt, we'd already come up
[46:28.120 --> 46:33.160]  with the exact same similar design, it is the don't tread on me American flag t-shirt
[46:33.160 --> 46:38.440]  inspired by the triggering of leftist of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt, but it's a battle
[46:38.440 --> 46:42.480]  tattered flag like the one that flew over Fort Sumter and again on the back, it says
[46:42.480 --> 46:49.360]  America's back, InfoWars.com, 4,000 of these babies and that's it, so we've got the Betsy
[46:49.360 --> 46:55.120]  Ross version and the American flag version at InfoWarsStore.com, it printed the USA right
[46:55.120 --> 47:02.120]  now, InfoWarsStore.com, they'll be right back, the most banned broadcast in the world.
[47:25.120 --> 47:35.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host Alex Jones, this is the InfoWars, children are
[47:35.120 --> 47:39.600]  being taken across the United States and Europe and being given to Muslim families if they're
[47:39.600 --> 47:47.080]  Christian as part of leftist social engineering, they say to teach you that diversity is good
[47:47.080 --> 47:52.120]  and that Christianity is bad, that's mainstream news, it's up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com,
[47:52.120 --> 47:56.640]  Elon Musk is announcing something beyond brain chips that basically a cell phone is going
[47:56.640 --> 48:01.440]  to be implanted, a mini cell phone, the guts of a cell phone is going to be implanted in
[48:01.440 --> 48:08.480]  your brain and then you're going to have wireless connections and that outside groups will be
[48:08.480 --> 48:13.560]  able to hack in and control your brain or kill you and they even admitted that on the
[48:13.560 --> 48:18.360]  news announcement because they metaphysically have to tell you but here's what's coming
[48:18.360 --> 48:32.120]  up next hour, in fact I have a father coming on who had his son taken away and a psychologist
[48:32.120 --> 48:39.320]  has now gotten involved and parades him around on TV and writes books about how he's transferring
[48:39.320 --> 48:47.720]  from a boy into a girl and the Texas judge has ruled and I'm going to still have him
[48:47.720 --> 48:53.640]  on this is so important and the Texas judge has ruled that he cannot refer to his son
[48:53.640 --> 48:59.400]  as a boy and the little boy says I want to be a boy with my dad, a girl with my mom,
[48:59.400 --> 49:05.640]  my mom wants me to be a girl, now he's seven, they're going to begin his castration next
[49:05.640 --> 49:13.400]  year so the death sentence for his son's testicles, his reproductive rights, this is the feminist
[49:13.400 --> 49:23.960]  literally seizing a war prize like shrunken heads, it's here, so he'll be joining us
[49:23.960 --> 49:32.000]  because this ties into all of this, this ties into all this nightmare and there's no end
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.640]  to how they parade little children who were sold into slavery, the parents make money
[49:36.640 --> 49:40.360]  off Desmond's amazing, he goes and dances half naked in front of pedophiles that throw
[49:40.360 --> 49:45.280]  money at him and he hangs out with convicted murderers who promote pedophilia, can't make
[49:45.280 --> 49:52.200]  that up, just all true, that is the type of evil desire that these people have and they're
[49:52.200 --> 49:56.280]  coming for your children, they're coming for your soul, they're coming for your brain
[49:56.280 --> 50:01.360]  and they want to induct you into a false reality, a virtual reality system so that from birth
[50:01.360 --> 50:08.120]  children can be in virtual reality so they can be deceived because Satan believes only
[50:08.120 --> 50:17.040]  then can he take control so that's what this whole thing is, is deception and making you
[50:17.040 --> 50:30.080]  accept deception, now when we start the second hour I'm going to play a top psychologist who
[50:30.080 --> 50:36.840]  testified to Congress, who called the last election for Trump, who voted for Hillary,
[50:36.840 --> 50:42.560]  his announcement that our republics over, our little de-democracies over and that any
[50:42.560 --> 50:49.840]  of the big tech companies can 100% steal the election with one click of a mouse and no
[50:49.840 --> 50:57.000]  money, here's the report, why Google poses a serious threat to democracy and how to
[50:57.000 --> 51:03.840]  end that threat and I agree with Robert Epstein PhD because I've researched all the information,
[51:03.840 --> 51:09.600]  your research, psychologist, American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, don't
[51:09.600 --> 51:17.840]  have to tell you who funds those people and he's telling you this is the end of America
[51:17.840 --> 51:23.520]  and I'm watching Ted Cruz in them, nothing against Ted Cruz but Ted Cruz is like yes
[51:23.520 --> 51:29.480]  Google can spend billions to steal the election, he goes sir it's one click to only remind
[51:29.480 --> 51:36.480]  Democrats to vote and they can get 20, 30 million more votes, it's over, he goes they
[51:36.480 --> 51:49.080]  did this for Obama against Mitt Romney and it probably gave it to Obama but they didn't
[51:49.080 --> 51:53.840]  think, they believed their own BS, they didn't think it was needed, they thought Hillary
[51:53.840 --> 51:57.720]  was going to win a landslide, they believed their own bull so they didn't send the notice
[51:57.720 --> 52:07.880]  out, I'm going to say that again, Google only noticed Democrats, only noticed Democrats
[52:07.880 --> 52:14.760]  in Obama's second election, you understand, that's one tool they've got for total election
[52:14.760 --> 52:22.200]  meddling and Google has said they're going to do this, so we're here, world government,
[52:22.200 --> 52:31.640]  AI running our elections, there was a gigantic landslide for Trump, that's why the system
[52:31.640 --> 52:36.960]  was panicking but they still believed their own propaganda in the end and Trump's landslide
[52:36.960 --> 52:41.120]  was barely able to make it over all of Hillary's fraud and the millions of people voting in
[52:41.120 --> 52:49.600]  the names of dead people repeatedly, it all happened, so I know I say this all the time
[52:49.600 --> 52:54.480]  is everything we cover here is critical but if you want to stop this and you want a lot
[52:54.480 --> 53:00.520]  of fire under Trump's ass because Trump has got a lot of confidence and that radiates
[53:00.520 --> 53:07.200]  and that's good but he has this belief that he can do it alone and that he can overpower
[53:07.200 --> 53:16.920]  this, no you can't, if they remind all the Democrats to go vote, if they tell them where
[53:16.920 --> 53:23.640]  the voting centers are, if they do all that and don't tell Republicans to do it, that's
[53:23.640 --> 53:33.640]  20 plus million votes the computer model show, you will lose, Hillary only had 3.3 million
[53:33.640 --> 53:37.960]  more popular vote than you, clearly fraud, I'm going to say it again Mr. President,
[53:37.960 --> 53:45.760]  20 plus million more, you will lose, Trump will lose the election if he doesn't take
[53:45.760 --> 53:50.920]  action and I agree with the report, we're going to play the key parts of the testimony,
[53:50.920 --> 53:56.760]  so listeners, what are you going to do, I love you, this is a marathon, take the live
[53:56.760 --> 54:02.080]  feed, infowords.com forward slash show, email it, text message it, call people, call people
[54:02.080 --> 54:06.600]  you know and say do you really, even if you hate Trump, do you really think it's good
[54:06.600 --> 54:11.200]  to meddle in the election, this isn't the Russians, it's the globalists that are in
[54:11.200 --> 54:16.240]  that with the chai comms, we can still contact people over email and text messages for now
[54:16.240 --> 54:21.640]  and word of mouth, infowords.com is still up, we're reaching record numbers of new people
[54:21.640 --> 54:27.640]  thanks to you, but we need to reach a lot more infowords.com forward slash show, infowords.com
[54:27.640 --> 54:33.320]  forward slash show and take the videos of this letter today from the live show that
[54:33.320 --> 54:39.920]  are posted and share them with everybody, we've got our own bandwidth, our own platforms,
[54:39.920 --> 54:44.200]  our own systems, they are fighting, they're having congressional hearings saying we want
[54:44.200 --> 54:49.160]  Jones off the air now or we're going to be thrown out of office, they know I'm on their
[54:49.160 --> 54:53.600]  ass, they know you're on their butt.
[54:53.600 --> 55:00.120]  And separately, I keep saying it's the last day because I've been so busy up here with
[55:00.120 --> 55:04.720]  all this, when I was up until eight last night, I'm not complaining, I am so busy with news
[55:04.720 --> 55:08.120]  and all of this and trying to watch all these new things we've got going and covert stuff
[55:08.120 --> 55:12.000]  we've got going, a lot of things happening, a lot of good stuff, we're fighting like the
[55:12.000 --> 55:15.920]  market of the beast is coming in and we've got to save people because it's real, that'll
[55:15.920 --> 55:17.720]  get you animated.
[55:17.720 --> 55:21.360]  World government, they're taking people's kids away to give them to people that have
[55:21.360 --> 55:28.120]  sex with them, devil worshipers are everywhere, the borders are wide open, diseases spreading
[55:28.120 --> 55:32.400]  everywhere, we're under attack folks and I'm not just going to sit there and take it lying
[55:32.400 --> 55:35.880]  down, neither are you.
[55:35.880 --> 55:41.360]  But we sold out of the limited edition, these colors don't run, Gadsden, well the Gadsden
[55:41.360 --> 55:48.440]  flag is the new one, Betsy Ross flag, we sold out of those but we've made two new variants
[55:48.440 --> 55:52.800]  that look very similar, just have some different colors and a few different designs, they still
[55:52.800 --> 55:56.720]  say these colors don't run, America's back and they're very similar but they're a new
[55:56.720 --> 56:02.840]  limited edition, again only 4,000 of those and it helps fund the operation, I have not
[56:02.840 --> 56:09.200]  had time to do new specials so all the apparel is still 1776, also we've got a lot of other
[56:09.200 --> 56:13.840]  exciting things happening, I had this idea last week and strangely enough the exact same
[56:13.840 --> 56:21.280]  type of shirt was being worn by, what's that guy's name, the Pratt guy, yeah Chris Pratt
[56:21.280 --> 56:26.000]  the point is, is that I'm teleprompter free, I said I want an American flag that says don't
[56:26.000 --> 56:31.080]  tread on me with the Gadsden snake on it, a week later I turn on TV he's wearing one
[56:31.080 --> 56:34.560]  just like it, because that's a smart idea, it combines the two shirts, don't tread on
[56:34.560 --> 56:38.800]  the flag with the snake, so we've got one that says don't tread on me, got another one
[56:38.800 --> 56:46.000]  that says these colors don't run and on the back it says America's back info wars dot
[56:46.000 --> 56:53.960]  com, so we brought back the Betsy Ross flags but a slightly different design, still excellent
[56:53.960 --> 57:01.960]  and we have this new limited edition shirt, and if I have a ton of money which selling
[57:01.960 --> 57:07.520]  15, 16, 17, 20,000 t-shirts even if I'm not able to sell that many it barely funds things
[57:07.520 --> 57:11.560]  around here for a month or two and we're only sold 4,000 of these, we've only sold 6,000
[57:11.560 --> 57:15.800]  of the Space Force shirt, I'm not complaining but we need to sell tens of thousands of shirts
[57:15.800 --> 57:19.800]  to fund this operation, we're only making $5, $6 on them, so please get in there and
[57:19.800 --> 57:27.160]  get them and trigger libtards and take action and just absolutely get the word out infowarstore.com
[57:27.160 --> 57:31.600]  or triple eight two five three three one three nine and a major university says do not use
[57:31.600 --> 57:36.600]  the term America, it's a hate symbol, that's coming up so we need to exercise these freedoms
[57:36.600 --> 57:42.520]  or lose them but the 1776 special on all the supplements 75 to 25% off it's all still there
[57:42.520 --> 57:50.360]  but it will be over today, I just haven't come up with new specials, thanks for the
[57:50.360 --> 57:51.360]  support.
[57:51.360 --> 57:53.880]  I just want listeners to understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against
[57:53.880 --> 57:58.400]  this and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info wars 50% off but we
[57:58.400 --> 58:03.480]  make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff, we're making like $2 on the toothpaste
[58:03.480 --> 58:07.640]  at that price and we're moving a ton of them okay but you move a couple hundred thousand
[58:07.640 --> 58:11.440]  dollars or something and you get $20,000 that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure
[58:11.440 --> 58:14.880]  the bandwidth the lawyers the crew so we need to sell millions and millions and millions
[58:14.880 --> 58:19.320]  of dollars of product, I want to expand not contract and for six months we've not just
[58:19.320 --> 58:23.280]  made a standstill the enemy's been winning and I have labored and labored and labored
[58:23.280 --> 58:27.080]  and labored on this, I like to be expanding, I like to be winning, I like to be fighting
[58:27.080 --> 58:30.760]  and we are winning the info war that's why we're so hated but we need to be retreaded
[58:30.760 --> 58:34.360]  we need to be tuned up, we need to be fixed up, we never have time to get into drive up
[58:34.360 --> 58:39.520]  we got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence us then they're really going
[58:39.520 --> 58:42.960]  to plant child porn on us then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else, I mean
[58:42.960 --> 58:47.000]  the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks in the Chicombs
[58:47.000 --> 58:48.840]  so go to infowarstore.com
[58:48.840 --> 58:52.840]  Robert Barnes what does big tech become?
[58:52.840 --> 58:56.200]  Big tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because
[58:56.200 --> 59:00.640]  they face no consequence of social economic political or legal for their illicit activities
[59:00.640 --> 59:04.760]  over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the judges the juries the members
[59:04.760 --> 59:08.280]  of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary members of the public and
[59:08.280 --> 59:12.600]  the audience that care about this has to bring real social political economic consequence
[59:12.600 --> 59:15.680]  to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and they will become the
[59:15.680 --> 59:19.720]  big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American
[59:19.720 --> 59:23.720]  politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover
[59:23.720 --> 59:28.840]  after the great depression the info wars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty
[59:28.840 --> 59:33.320]  across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the
[59:33.320 --> 59:37.520]  original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media
[59:37.520 --> 59:41.520]  manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake
[59:41.520 --> 59:44.960]  people's thought and then the war part of telling us the whole time it's not happening
[59:44.960 --> 59:48.880]  it's the ultimate form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even
[59:48.880 --> 01:00:16.440]  it is what we just thought you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:31.720]  I'll be honest with you we're all eating popcorn laughing and Ilhan Omar and all this stuff
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.800]  is really entertaining and it's good to see America stand up against political correctness
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:40.480]  and tell somebody that's bullied us and intimidated us and thinking we're bad people it's fun
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:45.880]  to say get the hell out of here and go back to your pirate kingdom but when Elon Musk
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:50.440]  comes out and says we're gonna have kiosk at the malls instead of getting a Tesla car
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:55.400]  you take your kid and get a bunch of wires plugged into your brain so we can control
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:02.160]  you it's basically a cell phone implanted in your brain oh don't worry nobody can see
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:11.560]  the wires oh it's just like his rocket ships it's just like his cars it's no big deal oh
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:18.120]  don't worry a robot does it looks like one of the robots that would you know torture
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:26.600]  people and empire strikes back oh all these electrodes get put in your brain it's so cool
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:34.240]  the cancer risk the the the infection risk the hacking risk the malfunction risk oh you
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:39.560]  think pacemakers have problems around microwaves or oh turn your cell phones off on the airplane
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:45.240]  it might interfere with the avionics but hey let's stick one in your kid's brain because
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:51.600]  you know brain tumors up thousands of percentile points admittedly from the cell phones hey
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:02:01.160]  let's put one right inside there now we'll really be cooking because you know God always
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:06.680]  wanted us to have a bunch of chips in our brain with wires hanging out the back of our
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:14.440]  head hooked into some ai with mark zuckerberg that says my dumb effing users trust me what
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:19.960]  a bunch of dumb efforts yeah let's let's let's have a big race with all these companies
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:25.160]  to get devices in your houses spying on you and to track everything you do and now hey
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.440]  these dumb bastards put up with this let's shove the wires in their head we'll have a
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:34.520]  bunch of TV shows tell the kids how cool it is they'll be like mommy for my birth that
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:39.200]  I want the new system but it's not called a chip it's not called a wire head it's not
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:51.840]  called cyborgs oh no it's got all these trending your names for it oh my gosh it's called neural
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:03:01.000]  links threads oh it's threads I just got my threads those are nice threads I just got
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:08.480]  my threads upgraded oh to the big juicy braintuber couple yeah well you know Facebook's coming
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:13.720]  out with their own global cashless currency and the word is there coming out with a different
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:19.160]  array and their own set of threads you know there's a lot of tailors in town a lot of
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:31.120]  place to get yourself some new threads pathways roads into your brain roads into the gateway
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:37.680]  to the soul we want your soul what's that techno song we gotta come over that we want
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:44.360]  your soul okay I built up to it I really don't know what's bigger news the mark of the beast
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:50.920]  world governments here by next year you'll be able to go into shops like the Apple store
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:56.080]  it'll be just like that and you go and talk to a doctor and look at the robot and schedule
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:00.800]  yourself and they're gonna have little glass windows where people can watch folks getting
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:06.480]  it it's so easy see take something really evil other medical stuff behind closed doors
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:11.240]  for privacy but make it all out in the open just like your brain with all those wires
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:20.040]  in it but of course there's gonna be discrimination against people that take it there's gonna be
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:24.920]  stiff prison sentences for those of you that even talk bad to someone that's gotten it
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:30.920]  by the way I have a family member who doesn't just have the wiring up his neck into his
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:36.160]  brain he he had one of those that are helped with his epilepsy from a motorcycle accident
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:43.880]  so my my dad's brother got one in the brain a few years ago and again it's not the chip
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:48.080]  itself's evil it's who's controlling it but the consumer rollout of this for communications
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:52.400]  and for everybody is the end of humanity and it will be used and abused and it is the
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:58.280]  mark of the beast and anybody that does this for other than medical reasons is insane.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:04.800]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history the globalists
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:10.360]  are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war borders are being
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:17.720]  broken and sovereignty is being challenged the world is going to change and how it changes
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:24.360]  will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails the system
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:30.560]  is vulnerable electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores could be empty
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:36.800]  in three days having storeable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:42.120]  chance in the next level and being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:48.960]  you a slave to a dying system buy storeable foods and an Alexa pure gravity water filter
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:06:08.720]  today support mankind by being prepared and support freedom by buying from infowarstore.com
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:38.680]  sending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:47.480]  this is undoubtedly what you're about to hear the most important broadcast we've ever done
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:54.600]  mass brain shipping with cell phone technology implanted in the brain is going to be rolled
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:07:04.280]  out at consumer levels next year at shopping malls nationwide by Elon Musk we played it
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:11.160]  last hour the news is saying it's wonderful everyone's gonna line up they'll hire PR firms
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:16.280]  have a bunch of young people going yeah and fighting like at the Apple store don't worry
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:22.040]  Apple's coming out with its own brain chip so is Facebook within one year they're going
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:30.760]  to announce you can't make this up made in China basically plugs wireless plugs they put
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:38.960]  sensors all over the brain inside the cranium you talk about infection you talk about illness
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:46.760]  and then there's a plug in the back of your neck PKD envision this in the 1970s Philip
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:55.360]  K Dick but I know all about PKD I'm in a movie of scanner darkly with Keanu Reeves and and
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:06.200]  I'm not at liberty to tell you but I'll just say that his daughters have the estate and

[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:56.920]  big tech so arrogant this isn't about free speech of big tech isn't about how it's their
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:02.520]  companies it's about how they're gaming with telecommunications system and working with
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:12.320]  foreign powers this is 21st century war there's a civil war in the government by the global
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:18.000]  is still trying to keep Trump from stopping them and I'm watching the senators blown away
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.080]  I've been telling them all this you've been telling them all this Google's on video bragging
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:32.800]  about it Facebook can steal the election Google can steal the election and they are you understand
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:42.680]  folks we've got to get this video out here is the testimony that is so absolutely critical
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:47.000]  Robert Epstein PhD senior research ecologist American Institute for behavioral research
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.520]  and technology for the United States Senate just sharing subcommittee on the Constitution
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:12:03.160]  here it is in 2020 you can bet that all of these companies are going to go all out and
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:10.960]  the methods that they're using are invisible they're subliminal they're more powerful than
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.240]  most any effects I've ever seen in the behavioral sciences and I've been in the behavioral sciences
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:29.240]  for almost 40 years I am indeed Dr. Robert Epstein the most important thing for you to
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:34.000]  know about me is that I'm the father of five wonderful children as it happens I'm also
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.640]  a research psychologist at the American Institute for behavioral research and technology I have
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:47.440]  been center center left my whole adult life but I value my country and democracy more
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:55.480]  than I value any party or candidate that is why I'm speaking out today I'm here to explain
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:13:02.520]  why Google poses a serious threat to democracy how monitoring systems can protect us from
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:09.640]  companies like Google and how Congress can immediately end Google's worldwide monopoly
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:15.920]  on search my plan for ending that monopoly was published just yesterday in business week
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:21.080]  I've been a research psychologist for nearly 40 years my PhD is from Harvard and since
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:26.560]  1981 I've published extensively on AI and other topics some of my research has focused
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:34.080]  on Google on the company's massive surveillance operations censorship capabilities and unprecedented
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:41.760]  ability to manipulate the thinking of 2.5 billion people soon to be four plus billion
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:48.200]  I've written articles articles about Google for Time Magazine USA Today that kind of thing
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:55.080]  but also for the Daily Caller and even Russia's Sputnik News I reach out to diverse audiences
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:00.840]  because I believe the threats posed by Google and to a lesser extent Facebook are so serious
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:06.080]  that everyone needs to know about them here are just three disturbing findings from my
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:12.040]  research which adheres to the very highest standards of scientific integrity number one
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:19.400]  in 2016 Google search algorithm likely impacted undecided voters in a way that shifted at
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:26.960]  least 2.6 million votes to Hillary Clinton whom I supported I know this because I preserved
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:34.640]  more than 13,000 election related searches prior to election day and Google's search
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:40.720]  results were significantly biased in favor of Secretary Clinton I know the number of
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:46.280]  votes that shifted because I've conducted dozens of controlled experiments that measure
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:53.760]  how opinions shift when search results are biased I call the shift seem the search engine
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:58.120]  manipulation effect which I first published in the proceedings of the National Academy
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:03.320]  of Sciences in 20 by the way let's just pause this was two days ago Drudge report linked
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:10.960]  to it we covered it some we covered it yesterday but it's gotten none of the attention deserves
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:17.480]  but we come back we'll start the segment with it with the doctor and you understand this
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:25.560]  is just first level what they can do and he's laying this out ladies and gentlemen how they're
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:29.960]  going to steal the election and how it's already basically happened unless all of us take action
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:36.000]  right now and there's only Ted Cruz and a few other people there the senators didn't
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.840]  even care to be there to hear this bombshell info that's because they're on the Google
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:48.560]  payroll it's unbelievable Google's basically our government now it's taken the country

[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:04.680]  it sinks into people but i've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:08.280]  in that if you go back five six years ago before all the censorship of the tax and fake
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:11.720]  lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the products are and how they were
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:15.560]  the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on an expert to explain why they were so good
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:19.240]  and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:21.960]  us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:25.640]  they are and how wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere jones
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:30.800]  sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law since
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:36.520]  1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:40.200]  it won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:44.240]  drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:48.000]  different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:53.360]  but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about god's medicine chest info or store dot com
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:20:01.240]  or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:30.240]  we're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:36.280]  i got to robert epstein testified to congress here is more of his testimony to the senate
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:43.400]  about the 2020 election is being stolen by google and facebook trump will lose other republicans
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:49.720]  will lose via fraud unless we take action there is no doubting any of this information
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:56.360]  let's go back to him when search results are biased i call this shift seem the search
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:00.840]  engine manipulation effect which i first published in the proceedings of the national
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:08.000]  academy of sciences in 2015 biased search results can easily produce shifts in the opinions
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:14.960]  and voting preferences of undecided voters by up to eighty percent in some demographic
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:23.720]  groups because people blindly trust high ranking search results over lower ones seem is an
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:29.520]  especially dangerous form of influence because it is in effect subliminal it also leaves
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:35.400]  no paper trail for authorities to trace it's an example of a short lived or quote ephemeral
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:39.920]  experience that's a phrase you'll find in internal emails that have leaked recently
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:48.440]  from google i'm now studying seven such manipulations like seem and unlike billboards or those russian
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:55.360]  placed ads these manipulations are invisible and non competitive they're controlled entirely
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:02.200]  by big tech companies and there is no way to counteract them number two on election
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:08.680]  day in twenty eighteen the go vote reminder that google displayed on its home page gave
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:15.600]  one political party at least eight hundred thousand more votes than it gave the other
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:24.280]  party that reminder was not a public service it was a vote manipulation number three in
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:28.800]  the weeks leading up to the twenty eighteen election bias in google search results may
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:37.440]  have shifted upwards of seventy eight point two million votes spread across many races
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:44.160]  to the candidates of one political party this number is based on bias in data captured by
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:48.760]  my twenty eighteen monitoring system which preserved more than forty seven thousand
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:55.720]  election related searches conducted by a diverse group of american voters i know how to stop
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:23:01.520]  big tech in its tracks and that brings me briefly here to monitoring systems in the proposal
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:07.480]  i published yesterday a twenty fifteen phone call from the attorney general of mississippi
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:12.760]  prompted me to start a years long project in which i have learned how to capture online
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:18.340]  ephemeral experiences in early twenty sixteen i deployed a system that allowed my team to
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:24.560]  look over people's shoulders as they conducted online searches with their permission i deployed
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:28.920]  a more sophisticated system in twenty eighteen and i'm raising funds now to build a much
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:33.680]  more comprehensive comprehensive system in twenty twenty one that will allow us to catch
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:40.120]  big tech in the act to instantly spot when facebook is biasing news feeds or when twitter
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:46.560]  is suppressing tweets sent by an colter or elizabeth warren by the way i pause this guy
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:50.640]  needs bodyguards and he does not need to fly on any private planes believe me if you think
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:56.480]  big tech is liberal and trendy that's their camouflage they are savage criminals let's
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:04.360]  continue elizabeth warren this system must be built to keep an eye on big tech in twenty
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:09.880]  twenty because if these companies all support the same candidate they will have the power
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:19.360]  to shift fifteen million votes to that candidate to let big tech get away with subliminal manipulation
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:27.240]  on this scale would be to make the free and fair election meaningless finally regarding
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:33.160]  yesterday's article congress can quickly end google's worldwide monopoly on search by declaring
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:39.960]  google's massive search index the database the company uses to generate search results
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:47.080]  to be a public commons accessible accessible by all just as a nineteen fifty six consent
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:53.080]  decree forced at&t to share all its patents there is precedent in both law and google's
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:58.040]  business practices to justify taking this step which will make online search competitive
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:04.960]  again and dramatically diminish google's power worldwide in nineteen sixty one eisenhower
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:10.480]  warned about the possible rise of a technological elite that would control public policy without
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:19.000]  people's awareness that elite now exists and you must determine where we go from here
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.240]  um doctor apstein i i found your testimony incredibly powerful and incredibly concerning
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:29.880]  and and if anyone draws news out of this hearing i would encourage you to review very carefully
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:36.040]  doctor apstein's testimony and i'd like to take a moment to make clear several things
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:43.200]  first of all as i understand your background you're not a republican and and nor are you
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:49.840]  a conservative is that accurate that would be an understatement and indeed you're the
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:56.280]  former editor in chief of psychology today correct so you're a respected academic you
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:04.280]  testified before this committee that google's manipulation of votes gave at least two point
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:09.960]  six million additional votes to hillary clinton in the year twenty sixteen is that correct
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:15.040]  that's correct and i want to make sure i understand you personally supported and voted
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:21.320]  for hillary clinton i was a very strong public supporter of hillary clinton yes so you're
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:28.800]  not just dismayed that people voted for but your testimony is that google is through bias
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:36.440]  in search results manipulating voters in a way they're not aware of on a massive scale

[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:37.040]  world governments being announced everywhere top psychologists that have run major institutes

[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:49.280]  analysis and that google is a hundred percent stealing the election for democrats with their
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:54.960]  search results with their auto complete you ever notice you're trying to type on a droid
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:34:04.640]  or an iphone that i just saw hillary on tv she's full of f-ing whatever i mean i'll admit
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:09.920]  it i have a big vocabulary i don't cuss a lot in person i don't cuss around my children

[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:38.760]  has come out and said that their new word system will make recommendations to be politically
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:44.920]  correct and that oh yes when it connects back to microsoft it reports on what you've written
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:52.800]  and sends compressed files of what you've typed key longer oh that's in the new software so
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:59.000]  see you won't be able to say manhole that berkeley's banning today or i got a major university
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  right here in the stack colorado state university says don't use the word america because it's
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:13.800]  been sensitive and non-inclusive you're like oh those wacky liberals you know i've read
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:19.000]  a lot of novels about future dystopias and none of them are scary as this this is unified
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:24.480]  worldwide by top computer scientists and evil psychiatrist a psychiatrist invented the internet
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:34.040]  yes it was an al gore what was it called the inner galactic communication network and it
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:41.520]  was meant to when government applies propaganda to watch people and to see how they behave
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:53.840]  so you could change stimuli and manipulate people in real time now then that was theoretical
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:36:01.920]  and then by the 60s and 70s got developed and and built by us and British scientists
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:14.440]  the intergalactic network 1962 that's right dr j c r lick lender yeah print me all that
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:22.200]  i should do a whole show on that and he said we don't want the public to even know we're
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:27.000]  controlling him that's key to the experiment and we've got to have kiosk and systems and
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.840]  he says he says if we can get it down to a handheld device it can watch them at all times
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:41.960]  even with a camera in it 1960s my dad again was in ut when he was in high school in the
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:48.600]  plan to program and they called them all in and said world government new world order
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:52.240]  we're carrying out eugenics operations that will give you a tour of the secret nuclear
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:59.800]  reactor don't tell anybody and all these kids are like we signed up to work with nasa they
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:06.720]  go we are nasa and this is a whole secret thing and again there are professors people
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:10.760]  listening all over the country that go yeah that happened to me this is a giant manhattan
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:22.840]  project folks to end humanity and obviously satan runs it yes and now they're on tv saying
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:29.800]  that we're all going to be able to go to the mall next year and don't worry a robot does
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:35.560]  it it's got like seven cameras all these needles and lasers this big robot head comes over
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:42.520]  and then puts a chip in you with wires and again you can't make it up meanwhile senator
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:47.760]  blumenthal the guy that stolen glory guy was never in vietnam never in combat he ran the
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:54.040]  toys for tots program in dc a little special thing for politicians kids he said he was
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:38:02.280]  in combat spit on when he came home and he was a combat marine corps captain the guy
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:10.920]  couldn't even put his boots on reportedly properly but he's a combat vet and he wants
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:20.720]  Alex jones off the air right now or america won't survive yeah right come back oh i'm
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:25.560]  sorry i said i get to the testimony the whole thing is on info wars dot com hours of it
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:30.720]  and a boil down 14 minutes is on info wars dot com in the article that i hope everybody
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:36.880]  wants to get out because one of two things trump is surrounded by a bunch of liars googles
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:41.280]  buying everybody off trump doesn't realize how dominant the censorship is and how manipulative
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:46.480]  and how controlled it is and how googles bigger than all the tv networks combined and that
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:51.120]  people blindly got habituated back when google wasn't gaming things that they're getting
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:57.260]  truth from it like it's the oracle of delphi like it's mommy's milk baby doesn't question
[01:38:57.260 --> 01:39:07.320]  mommy's milk baby hungry mommy pulls it out baby goes through the pink target it's it's
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:18.800]  it's it's just second nature you understand that and from slide i'll just have more rallies
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:25.640]  i'll do 10 rallies and a day it won't matter because nobody will see it online and no one
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:28.760]  will get told where to go vote and they're gonna have all the illegal aliens go vote
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:36.800]  directed by google so either trump doesn't know what's going on or he's the biggest
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:40.560]  decepticon i've ever seen and i'm not saying he's that because i have a good feeling about
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:45.240]  him and i've seen how they hate him but you know what ignorance is still just as bad as
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:52.280]  being benedict darnold and i mean i mean is trump inept is he a moron he already let
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:40:00.720]  him basically steal 2018 this is the issue and these arrogant senators are freaked out
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:09.800]  they don't i told ted cruise all this to his face i've told all these people this i'm
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:16.720]  some guy in texas i figured it out you sure as hell can figure it out i'm gonna go to
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:21.160]  break come back with the rest testimony because we're too close to break and it's just it's
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:29.080]  just unbelievable i mean it i can't believe and i'm not mad at the audience but i'm frustrated
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:34.520]  that i have to sit here and beg people when we've got total proof they're gonna steal
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:42.800]  the 2020 election and yeah the article's getting shared but a lot of people are like well info
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:46.880]  wars i might get censored on twitter or facebook if i share that or someone might think something
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:51.960]  bad about me because alex has been demonized they demonize what's effective and true so
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:56.280]  everyone are followers and are scared of it and then don't it's like you're in the middle
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:00.560]  of the desert and there's this nice big oasis and you see animals drinking out of the water
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:04.160]  and you know it's good water and you're coming through the desert and you're and you're dying
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:09.760]  a thirst and somebody says oh don't drink that it's racist you go oh thanks for the warning

[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:38.900]  it's so ridiculous what they've done but we have to get out of the trance and get moving
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:46.960]  and say no it's just insane and we have all the internal videos of google stealing the
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:51.160]  elections and bragging how they're doing it and just all of this and they make people

[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:01.480]  only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the other thing
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:06.560]  that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not backed
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:10.720]  by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:14.800]  not being funded by secret foreign government it is completely independent of all that it
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:20.520]  is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:24.360]  and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:28.720]  the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:32.280]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:36.120]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:40.240]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:45.680]  have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that they are the bridge
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:49.840]  from the founding to the modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:54.680]  why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the black warming defamation lawfare and
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:45:03.800]  libel targeting youth info wars the most banned network in the world so the info wars model
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:09.040]  is a self-fulfilling self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:13.120]  by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another it
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:18.160]  is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach it is the
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:23.320]  one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting self-sustaining self-structured
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:27.640]  little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:31.920]  up the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:35.320]  info wars and it's all because the audience spends there whatever it is whether it's
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:39.480]  five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products that they like and that they want that actually
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:43.880]  compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:48.520]  support press support speech support letting the audience choose what news they want to
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:52.800]  see and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate american democratic expression
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:59.040]  and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets

[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:20.080]  alex jones show stay in attack formation alex jones here back live in case any of you are
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:26.120]  doubting me there are hundreds of lawsuits by former google employees about the harassment
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:29.760]  they went through and i've read over a bunch of them some of the lawyers that represent
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:34.720]  me are involved in these and i've had long discussions over some really good rum with
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:40.880]  bob barnes about it and others and literally a lot of the google executives are out of
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:48.880]  their minds hundreds of google shareholders are billionaires some of the shareholders
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:55.080]  are worth you 100 billion plus you always hear about this guy's worth 170 billion this
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:48:00.200]  guy's 100 billion it's way more than that in fiat currency and so they get decadent they
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:04.400]  get crazy they get insane roman emperors used to just kill themselves because they said
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:09.960]  there's no meaning to life they were so bored so it shows money doesn't bring happiness
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:14.640]  enough money to be comfortable brings a level of freedom and happiness but then once you
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:19.520]  get into total decadence for the money itself it will destroy you faster than anything if
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:24.840]  you make money at the top of your hierarchy of needs and so burp girl gets banned off the
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:30.040]  internet because people were fat shaming her but we've got it here we've got our own networks

[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:06.080]  got the hidden camera video you've seen it all just arrogant on scene it's like why are
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:09.640]  people getting on ice cream and licking it why are people doing it they go oh they just
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:16.080]  want attention no they want to disrespect people they want to break the social compact
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:21.520]  all the statistics left us litter more they don't give the charity they steal way more
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:29.240]  but they tell you that they give the charity constantly i haven't been paid this year because
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:33.360]  i'm busy trying to expand pay my crew that's fine it's been hard times you know here at
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:39.840]  m4 is under attack it's great no big deal i'm spending money i saved years ago but i did
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:45.240]  make donations i did make some charitable donations today and i'm not going to say who
[01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:53.320]  i made them to the point is is that conservatives are nine times more likely to give the charity
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:58.720]  leftist are nine times more likely to steal look up the numbers they're mentally ill they're
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:05.200]  ugly too because they have ugly spirits they're demonic let's go ahead and go back to the
[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:10.280]  incredible testimony by the way i was pointing out that dr robert epstein testified to congress
[01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:13.880]  on how the elections are being stolen by google facebook and do it too but google's the big
[01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:19.800]  enchilada and the senators are just blown away which shows they really they're a bunch
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:24.880]  of arrogant lawyers even if they mean well like crews they just you guys are so damn
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:29.440]  arrogant and the left puts on that leftist libtard act and you don't understand how vicious
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:34.920]  they are but he said assuming i don't get killed first while say crossing a street i'll be
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:39.880]  testifying before hashtag congress is coming tuesday about hashtag google search algorithm
[01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:45.600]  and about how quickly and google's worldwide monopoly of search is still in the elections
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:50.520]  basically wish me luck i said this guy has a lot of courage by the way he's been involved
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:55.600]  overseeing major institutes major stuff and interfaces with darpa you know these psychologists
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:53:01.200]  and psychiatrists all have this little friendly demeanor this guy is serious business so let's
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:05.200]  go back to his testimony on how the election is already being stolen and if truck doesn't
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:08.800]  take action and if we don't take action well that's it we're a bunch of idiots here it
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:17.960]  is bias in search results manipulating voters in a way they're not aware of on a massive
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:23.480]  scale and what i'm saying is that i believe in democracy i believe in the free and fair
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:30.760]  election more than i have any kind of allegiance to a candidate or a party and looking forward
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:36.840]  if i understood your testimony correctly you said in subsequent elections google and facebook
[01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:42.480]  and twitter and big text manipulation could manipulate as many as 15 million votes in
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:49.000]  a subsequent election in 2020 if all these companies are supporting the same candidate
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:54.640]  there are 15 million votes on the line that can be shifted without people's knowledge
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:54:01.320]  and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace now you described the go vote reminder
[01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:05.160]  and you said it wasn't a public service announcement but rather manipulation can you explain how
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:14.800]  i'm not sure everyone followed the details of that well sure if on election day in 2016
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:21.920]  if mark zuckerberg for example had chosen to send out a go vote reminder say just to
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:28.520]  democrats and no one would have known if he had done this that would have given that day
[01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:35.360]  an additional at least 450 thousand votes to democrats and we know this without doubt
[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:41.720]  because of facebook's own published data because they did an experiment that they didn't tell
[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:49.080]  anyone about during the 2010 election they published it in 2012 it had 60 million facebook
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:56.240]  users involved they sent out a go vote reminder and they got something like 360 thousand more
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:01.040]  people to get off their sofas and go vote who otherwise would have stayed home the point
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:08.720]  is i don't think that mr. zuckerberg sent out that reminder in 2016 i think he was overconfident
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:13.440]  i think google google was overconfident that all these companies were i don't think he
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:18.400]  sent that out without monitoring systems in place we'll never know what these companies
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:21.480]  are doing we're gonna go to break point is when we come back we're gonna finish up with
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:25.240]  the most important parts that the election will be stolen they said they're going to
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:30.080]  steal it if we don't take action and there's even more i mean i should probably just i
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:35.160]  mean it's so powerful folks the full testimony and the boil down is on info wars dot com for
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:41.680]  yourself for your children for everybody and your awesome listeners but this is not a this
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:50.720]  is not a a spectator sport this is a absolute do or die situation and this analysis is spot
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:57.600]  on it but only covering one section of how they're doing all this all they do is put
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:03.080]  the negatives of about conservatives at the top they said in california that the party
[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:09.520]  affiliation of republicans is the nazi party on the front page of google everything they
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:15.360]  do is the social engineer and then they lie to congress about it when we have all their
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:20.080]  internal emails their documents their own employees going public undercover videos i
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:26.200]  mean it's a joke it's like digging up twenty five dead boys that john wane gasey killed
[01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:31.640]  in his basement the cops finally got a search warrant and there's a bunch of dead bodies
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:38.040]  and photos of him killing him cold open and shut and if we sit here when this is open
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:43.520]  and shut with our thumbs you know where then damn it i'm not trying to get angry here i
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:49.760]  just cannot believe these people it's like coming home and your neighbors on top your
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:56.080]  wife you open the door and i mean and they both go we're not having sex and your neighbor
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:57:01.360]  gets up and tells himself off your wife's got her legs behind her ears and it's like
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:09.480]  yeah man you're having sex with my wife okay don't tell me no no bob i'm not i'm sick of
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:15.360]  this it's like saying the kids are in concentration camps and trumps killing them the things are
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:22.320]  nicer than the public schools i went to oh i forgot to plug this whole hour i'm the biggest
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:27.600]  threat to this whole operation it's not a gimmick that i keep saying the last three days it's

[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:56.560]  say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talk to a lot of people here out in new york city and
[01:58:56.560 --> 01:59:01.280]  one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons
[01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:06.000]  are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:10.480]  that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:14.000]  trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he can be
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.000]  defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:22.320]  last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements

[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:32.320]  all right ladies and gentlemen i'm going to finish up with this incredible testimony the full
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:37.200]  testimony is posted in the article with the boil down at info wars dot com top research
[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:42.320]  psychological scientists reveals how google and facebook are going to steal the 2020 election
[02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:48.400]  unbelievably important i'm intend to open the phones up after that on elon musk his rollout of
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:54.400]  the worldwide cell phones to be implanted and everybody's brains it'll be sold in malls next
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:01:00.960]  year they're saying uh please just can't make this up it's all happening there's so much i've
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:03.600]  even gotten all the other news i've just been harping on this because it's so important but
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:08.320]  i'm gonna open the phones up to get your take on the next segment but here's a more of what the
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:14.560]  research scientist expert in psychological manipulation robert epstein broke down here it is
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:21.200]  i don't think he sent that out without monitoring systems in place we'll never know
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:27.280]  what these companies are doing but the point is in 2018 i'm sure they were more aggressive
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:35.920]  we have lots of data to support that and in 2020 you can bet that all of these companies are going
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:45.280]  to go all out and the methods that they're using are invisible they're subliminal they're more powerful
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:50.000]  than most any effects i've ever seen in the behavioral sciences and i've been in the behavioral
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:55.600]  sciences for almost 40 years you know our democratic colleagues on this committee often talk about
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:02.320]  what they view as the pernicious effect of big money and big corporate dollars uh what you are
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:08.880]  testifying to is that a handful of silicon valley billionaires and giant corporations are able to
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:16.320]  spend millions of dollars if not billions of dollars collectively massively influencing the
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:23.600]  results of elections and there's no accountability you said we don't know we have no way of knowing
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:28.800]  if google or facebook or twitter sends it sends its democrats or republicans or how they bias it
[02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:33.920]  because it's a black box with with with with no transparency or accountability whatsoever
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:39.680]  am i understanding you correctly senator with respect i must correct you please if mark zuckerberg
[02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:45.120]  chooses to send out a go vote reminder just to democrats on election day that doesn't cost him
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:55.760]  a dime fair enough um do you happen to know who the hillary clinton campaign's number one financial
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:04.640]  supporter was in the year 2016 uh i think i do but please remind me the the number one financial
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:09.280]  supporter of the hillary clinton campaign in the 2016 election was the parent company of google
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:14.000]  alphabet okay who was our first witness they were her number one financial donor and your
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:20.080]  testimony is through their deceptive search methods they moved 2.6 million votes in her
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:27.520]  direction i would think anybody whether or not you favor one candidate or another should be deeply
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:34.320]  dismayed about a handful of silicon valley billionaires having that much power over our elections
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:42.960]  to silently and deceptively shift vote outcomes again with respect i must correct you the 2.6
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:51.840]  million is a rock bottom minimum the range is between 2.6 and 10.4 million depending on how
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:57.040]  aggressively they used the techniques that i've been studying now for six and a half years wow
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:05.840]  could could you say that again please just the 2.6 million is a rock bottom minimum the range is
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:14.480]  between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes depending on how aggressive they were in using the techniques
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:20.960]  that i've been studying such as the search engine manipulation effect the search suggestion effect
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:29.360]  the answer bot effect and a number of others they control these and no one can counter act them
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:38.880]  these are not competitive these are tools that they have at their disposal exclusively if any
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:48.640]  headline comes out of this hearing that should be it defending the republic from enemies foreign
[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:59.440]  and domestic it's alex jones barbara bars what does big tech become a big tech are big babies
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:03.520]  that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence social
[02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:07.840]  economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that
[02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:11.920]  that's why the courts the judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:15.920]  about this the ordinary members of the public in the audience that care about this has to bring real
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:20.000]  social political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:24.080]  change and they will become the big tech oleg arcs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th
[02:05:24.080 --> 02:05:28.640]  century who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:33.600]  to recover after the great depression the inforores audience is the fuel that flames the the light
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:38.640]  of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real
[02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:42.960]  the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:47.360]  manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:51.040]  thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate
[02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:55.520]  form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw
[02:05:57.600 --> 02:06:04.080]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:08.560]  baby i'm gonna teach you what a love's all about tonight
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:16.560]  trust me honey everything's gonna be all right
[02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:24.560]  just do like i do there ain't nothing to it listen to me baby
[02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:32.080]  mk alter was the secret cia crash program to develop techniques to control the human mind
[02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:39.760]  by the end of the korean war 70 percent of the 7 000 u.s prisoners of war had signed confessions
[02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:48.000]  15 cooperated fully and only five percent steadfastly for refused confession or indoctrination
[02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:54.160]  professors wolf and hinkle submitted a secret report to director of central intelligence
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:07:00.320]  alan dullis about communist methods of brainwashing that was the definitive work on the subject in
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:07.680]  1953 it stated that no drugs or machines were used intense psychological pressure
[02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:14.560]  and human weakness were the key beginning with solitary confinement guards constantly reminded
[02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:20.960]  the prisoner that he was totally cut off from outside support ordered him to stand for long
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:27.120]  periods dictated the positions allowed for sleep waking him if he moved while sleeping
[02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:34.160]  being banned all outside stimuli such as books conversation or news of the outside world
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:42.160]  after four to six weeks the prisoner would break down quote he weeps he mutters and prays
[02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:49.840]  aloud in his cell at this stage the interrogation began in a special room the guard told him
[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:55.600]  that he knew his own crimes all too well the prisoner is in the position of trying to prove
[02:07:55.600 --> 02:08:02.160]  his innocence to he knew not what the interrogator and the prisoner bond in their shared ransacking
[02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:08.720]  of the captive soul as the interrogation proceeded the prisoner realized that he could only end his
[02:08:08.720 --> 02:08:15.680]  ordeal with a full confession quote the prisoner feels that something must be done to end this
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:24.800]  he must find a way out according to a kgb man more than 99 percent of prisoners sign a confession
[02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:31.120]  at this stage then the subject was either shot or sent to a labor camp after sentencing
[02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:38.160]  chinese techniques would move on to reeducation of prisoners by moving them into a group cell
[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:46.000]  for political indoctrination incessant study of marks and mal lectures and self-criticism led
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:51.680]  to political conversion by group pressure prisoners demonstrated their commitment
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:59.280]  by ferociously attacking any deviations constant intimacy with prisoners who reviled him for his
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:04.880]  resistance all right the prisoner beyond backed us up a bit this is a two hour 15 minute documentary
[02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:12.400]  made back in the 1990s titled project monarch slash the phoenix project
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:21.520]  it's called the phoenix program that was really a project and it's very accurate and this is just
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:26.640]  in the middle getting into mk ultra in the united states because i wanted to play the part coming
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:34.080]  up where they show the church hearings in congress senator frank church with how the cia wanted to
[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:40.080]  try to figure out how to basically convince the public to accept cell phone towers everywhere
[02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:46.320]  that they would then beam these wavelengths that would make you violent or passive of course that's
[02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:51.600]  been declassified but Elon musk just came out and said we'll put it right in your brain at the mall
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:57.440]  starting next year so you used to go buy a tesla at the mall well now you go get your brain ship
[02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:03.440]  it's the coolest and there's a robot that puts it in like show tv viewers the robot so don't worry
[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:07.840]  human doesn't do it a robot drills into your skull lasers and then places all the electrodes in your
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:16.800]  brain with a little robot it's a little friendly pal it sticks at your brain tissue this is
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:23.920]  these to do the prisoners and stuff in mk ultra but now they do it even by the 60s they were
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:28.800]  putting wires into people's brains in psychiatric facilities but now they just do it on a mass scale
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:34.560]  so we're now into hour number three and if you just joined us boy uh did you miss out
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:42.240]  top behavioral scientists that's done major work and headed up groups with DARPA
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:49.680]  testified to congress and he says he might get killed for this uh that uh google is basically a
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:56.240]  giant ai social engineering system to control and run our lives and then it manages every facet
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:11:01.840]  of what we do in a giant reeducation camp setting that facebook is now breaking into
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:06.320]  reeducation camps where you'll have to have group facebook to have one where all your
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:10.800]  data is shared with the people in the group but most of the group will be ai bots that instruct
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:16.880]  you and talk to you but you're not even told that robots and then if you deviate in the improper
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:23.200]  language uh you will get in big trouble and facebook's coming out with a fiat currency so
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:29.600]  they're first going to give people money free money if they behave themselves in the giant
[02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:36.480]  reeducation camp and there's internal facebook documents have come out so they have uh google
[02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:41.600]  is where they talk about how they unconsciously control you and then it's it's like a group session
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:49.440]  aka a reeducation camp and from germany to the united states many liberal cities are banning
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:54.320]  single family homes saying the family is bad and then everyone's going to live in group
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:12:02.160]  communals we have tiny bedrooms and shared living rooms with other groups in china they call it the
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:15.440]  great leap forward and the cultural revolution but a lot of folks in our own government are
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:21.840]  saying it's wrong a lot of people in the military know what's wrong and we're gonna we're gonna stop
[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:28.960]  it folks so there's that and then let's just go ahead and air that two-minute piece again because
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:34.960]  that was over two hours ago that i first played it of elon musk in a rollout on the news about
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:39.600]  forget a brain ship it's a whole bunch of electrodes in your brain with a cell phone
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:45.760]  transmitter oh that sounds really good you know normally your iphone explodes or something you
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:50.560]  know it just burns your hand now you die well there's an ampere any type of problem and it
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:54.800]  fries your brain that's okay people are going to do it because they're going to have movie
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:13:00.000]  stars doing it and trendies and kind of like the oscars where all the nurses came out and
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:06.720]  gave people the flu shot but it really wasn't the flu shot they tried this with digital angel
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:13.040]  under uh obama and others with the federal funding they have a topless bars in florida
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:22.320]  and in uh also in madrid spain but you don't get into the club into the vip area the champagne room

[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:25.280]  like to censor those voices as well at the summit but we'll see i have a feeling this is just going
[02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:30.240]  to be throwing a dog a bone patting him on the head and telling him to move on with his day but
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:36.160]  hopefully maybe disperse some action from congress from the president from the white house to do

[02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:51.120]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live we are back live broadcasting worldwide ladies and
[02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:57.120]  gentlemen on this thursday worldwide transmission i'm gonna open the phones up with what's your
[02:20:57.120 --> 02:21:02.880]  take on elon musk i said i'd play this video last segment i didn't so let me play it now
[02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:06.160]  and then we'll go write your phone calls and then of course the other big story
[02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:15.440]  google brags that they could get 78 million more people to tip their vote the way they want in an
[02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:22.480]  election simply by manipulating search results and blocking conservative search results that's
[02:21:22.480 --> 02:21:30.320]  what they're doing they're in a giant criminal power grab and they've lied to congress about it
[02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:40.160]  so we're going to play the clip again about elon musk and the rollout of the brain
[02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:46.320]  implants at your local shopping mall because you read deeper in the fine print everything
[02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:52.880]  that they intend to have the centers like an apple store and you go in and you get your chips so now
[02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:57.040]  big tech could be inside your brain even more here it is
[02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:03.920]  elon musk has developed electric cars with tesla
[02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:12.720]  and sent rockets to space and back with space x but now he's taking on what may be the real
[02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:19.360]  final frontier we can do a full brain machine interface combining man and machine with a
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:24.800]  new technology dubbed nora link which would allow data to be transmitted between humans
[02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:31.280]  and computers here's how it works an array of tiny threads only a tenth as big as a human hair
[02:22:31.280 --> 02:22:37.200]  embedded with thousands of electrodes is inserted into the brain by a robotic device the threads
[02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:43.440]  are connected to a chip that transmits back and forth to an external receiver the interface to the
[02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:50.320]  um to the to the chip is wireless so you have no wires poking out of your head very very important
[02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:57.440]  hit boss please imagine when the power supply blows up in your head but again ladies and gentlemen
[02:22:57.440 --> 02:23:06.560]  just think about how crazy all of this has gotten
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:11.840]  but they made the decision it's a post-human world
[02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:16.480]  they made the decision that humanity sucks and we're over
[02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:27.280]  and so they're just doing it and then those of us that were trailblazers and warned everybody
[02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:32.160]  about it before it was ever admitted and we've been proven exactly right we're the bad guys
[02:23:32.160 --> 02:23:39.360]  that have to be taken off air let's continue it's basically bluetooth to your phone musk says
[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:45.680]  neural link may help the human brain cure diseases and even reverse paralysis eventually it could be
[02:23:45.680 --> 02:23:52.240]  used to connect with external devices with a high bandwidth brain machine interface i think we can
[02:23:52.240 --> 02:23:59.120]  actually go along for the ride um and we can effectively have the option of merging with AI
[02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:05.040]  and this is extremely important neural link claims the devices have been successfully implanted in
[02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:11.600]  rats and at least one monkey is able to control a computer one monkey the company hopes to implant
[02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:16.800]  the first neural link into a human patient by the end of the year analysts worried this technology
[02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:23.440]  could have unforeseen negative impacts we aren't aware yet that the technology is gone in reverse
[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:31.280]  meaning that you can use some sort of external force to implant thoughts or something else
[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:35.840]  inside of the brain there are like with anything else there are downsides think about a hacker
[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:42.320]  getting into a brain interface that's one think about government control of people's brains
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:51.280]  controlling what they think uh things like that are obviously a concern from star wars to the
[02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:56.880]  terminator science fiction has long dreamt of merging humans with technology but with rapidly
[02:24:56.880 --> 02:25:03.040]  evolving robots and artificial intelligence hello everyone in my english artificial intelligence
[02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:10.320]  anchor what was once fiction is quickly becoming fact as this technology evolves the question may be
[02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:17.600]  can we merge man and machine without losing some of our humanity jim spellman cgtn washington
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:22.400]  so the vampires tell you up front this is the end of your humanity oh let's take the kids down to
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:31.280]  the mall at the local tesla dealership and sign them up for major brain surgery to have at least
[02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:36.320]  six electrodes put in different parts of the brain oh but don't worry a robot does it so it's really
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:45.360]  done professionally and then you have all the trojan horsing all the background all the oppression
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:51.520]  all the control all all of this and the fact that cell phones in this whole culture is killing us
[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:55.520]  making us depressed making us alone making us suicidal
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:03.120]  and scientific american big reports about cell phone radiation is able to be fluctuated to mind
[02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:10.400]  control you well i've even gotten to that documentary on the cia and the declassification
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:17.600]  of what's going on that that's what the cell towers are already doing so we're in a giant
[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:24.160]  experiment and the people running it want to be god they're psychotic they're mad scientists
[02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:30.800]  you know like every comic book villain is a mad scientist or something because that's
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:35.040]  people have known about this a long time the nazis were run by a bunch of mad scientists
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:41.360]  they were funded by the united states and british intelligence
[02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:50.640]  and we're just marching into it oh they'll never be human clones they've been human clones for
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:27:00.400]  probably 70 years and i'ma say it again china is giving birth to humanoids they're not humans
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:06.800]  by the side of a definition they're called a humanoid or human like creature who are made
[02:27:08.800 --> 02:27:14.080]  from a whole bunch of people's genetics spliced that's not a human a human is a man and a woman
[02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:23.200]  their entire genetic background coming together with with with with with trillions of a percentile
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:31.760]  non-failure rates to then form this creature and they've told us we're a piece of crap that's
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:38.720]  a parasite it's ugly what's beautiful is what the tech companies are going to make they'll make
[02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:44.080]  beautiful creatures yeah well all they've been making so much of abominations that's why they
[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:50.080]  keep it most of it hidden but let me tell you something they haven't just spliced humans
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:57.760]  they haven't just spliced spiders and goats puny pie made a joke about it once video i did where i
[02:27:57.760 --> 02:28:05.360]  was talking to a research scientist who had talked to a research scientist who was crying
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:12.640]  over the creatures that the they had produced and it's now in medical literature this is going on
[02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:22.720]  part human part eight forget that they have created species of fish that basically have 90 percent human
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:32.160]  brains so you just remember that folks oh but we're talking to old people we save money kill babies
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:36.720]  keeping comfortable nobody has rights that means you have no rights when you don't stand up for

[02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:04.560]  daughter in when she gets her ears pierced and get a cell phone implanted inside her head i'm
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:10.560]  sure that'll be healthy yeah they they are looking for any way to get you conditioned to accept the
[02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:16.480]  mark of the beast they give you all these dopamine hits they just it's so addicting everything they
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:20.640]  do like the facial recognition on the phone the change you look like an old person everybody's
[02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:25.840]  doing it not realizing that they're giving that way their uh their face recognition and uh
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:30.560]  they just get the dopamine hit off but they're all so excited it's like the pokemon thing
[02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:34.160]  where you know everybody ran around looking for all this stuff and all you did was turn
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:39.040]  into a google vehicle for them to go around and google earth everything and so any spot they
[02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:43.040]  wanted to check or look at they just send humans out looking for imaginary pokemons

[02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:54.880]  a carrot tied in front of it they are looking for any way that they can turn you into a satan
[02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:59.760]  that's because satan hates everything about us because we are made in the image of god and he's
[02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:04.880]  looking for any way to destroy that he's been trying it for thousands of years and with all
[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:09.440]  this technology and advancement that he's brought to us it's it's it's getting people over paul
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:14.560]  riding like little sheep and that's why everything they do is about dehumanizing yourself killing
[02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:20.720]  yourself hurting yourself debasing yourself and debasing others like the burping girl this is what
[02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:33.440]  they've turned people into here she is on your zesty salsa burp on your mashed potatoes i bet you

[02:37:55.600 --> 02:38:01.040]  again this is all about disrespect it's all about defiling it's all about worshiping death these people

[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:42.800]  fluoride they don't get any iodine uh they they they're just not able to think for themselves
[02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:46.800]  and they and they sit around and watch this all day long like it's entertainment and don't realize
[02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:53.200]  that they're just it's just a decay of society and it's just it's it's rapid it's just happening
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:59.760]  faster and faster and faster just over the last year you have seen so much uh happen in the way of
[02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:06.640]  decay it's total decay it's by design and now elon muskin warned about ai and brain chips now
[02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:10.720]  he's the one rolling it out you think it was set up like that all along so we'd subconsciously
[02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:16.720]  think oh he's the guy fighting it but then he's the guy selling it yeah he's absolutely that
[02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:21.840]  they all are there i mean they didn't he didn't get to where he was or it has made the money he has
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:25.760]  with without the government you know and without those people pushing along you know the people
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:31.040]  pulling the strings beyond the curtains and it's just i wouldn't trust him well i know this
[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:38.400]  elon musk is wanting you and to take your sons and daughters in and have a robot put a bunch of
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:43.920]  wires and plugs into your brain oh let's go have brain surgery this weekend oh yeah oh i had my
[02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:50.080]  brain surgery now i've got a corporation put wires in my brain so it knows what i'm doing
[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:56.480]  and by the way this stuff's all one way you don't you don't control anything with it it controls you
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:07.680]  it's all one way from the beginning unbelievable uh alec yes um i i got a plug for the for the
[02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:15.200]  patriot points i get i got 180 so far this year a patriot point and i feel like i'm stealing from
[02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:20.640]  you but i i buy so much in the store because i mean i don't want to give that money to walmart
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:24.720]  i don't want to give that money to people who are going to get donated to causes i don't believe in
[02:40:24.720 --> 02:40:28.880]  so i'd rather give that money to you and i'm getting quality products the products that i do
[02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:35.280]  receive or have changed my life i mean the x2 has really done a lot for me i've lost weight
[02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:42.240]  uh my brain works a whole lot better i and my kids uh they use the toothpaste uh my son used to get
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:46.400]  to these little uh sore throats and he puts x2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore
[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:52.160]  throat uh he let me break this down for you i've never really done marketing but i did
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:58.080]  bring in a few advertising people a few years ago who knew how to advertise online and they said
[02:40:58.080 --> 02:41:05.120]  mr jones they said what's your markup and i said 150 but we always discount 25 so that's
[02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:10.640]  100 percent and they said yeah and then you're always discounting 20 30 percent and then we notice
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:15.920]  you only sell stuff when it's at 50 percent and then you're barely making any money you need to stop
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:20.400]  that and they looked at our data and they said oh your audience would buy it if it was even more
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:25.600]  and i said i want i quality stuff in there i want a good price but i've kind of habituated everybody
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:32.720]  trained everybody myself done this to where everybody buys when it's 50 off i'm making
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:36.720]  two dollars on the toothpaste 50 off because there's no fillers it's concentrated it's got
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:42.720]  iodine a little silver uh and so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone
[02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:49.840]  broth i mean dna force i signed a multi-year contract on that so i was able to cut the price
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:56.400]  about 40 of what we were paying it still got 30 something dollars a product in it then you add
[02:41:56.400 --> 02:42:00.880]  all the marketing and everything else it's it's it's it's it's incredibly low price
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:06.720]  they're selling dna force type products that doctors offices that don't have as much pqq or
[02:42:06.720 --> 02:42:10.720]  coq tenant i mean you talk about cleaning your cells out you talk about energy stamina you talk
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:16.800]  about letting the telomeres last longer this is patented to do that and nobody puts this much
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:22.240]  of the real organic stuff in it they put synthetic crap in it and charge even more so yes dna force
[02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:30.080]  is amazing uh it's discounted right now uh at uh 50 percent off because again i want people to
[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:34.720]  experience dna force so thank you so much for the plugs but listen it's crucial and thank you
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:43.840]  when people get the patriot points a lot of times it makes things a loss later uh because if you're
[02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:49.200]  already getting 10 off because you're on autoship and then we're doing 50 off and then you do something
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:53.200]  like that uh where you have patriot points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support

[02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:15.120]  explain why they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support
[02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:18.160]  us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they
[02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:21.840]  know how great they are and how wonderful they work and the left always has headlines everywhere
[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:28.640]  jones sells unapproved supplements he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996
[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:33.520]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't
[02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:38.000]  look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the
[02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:41.680]  system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things and a
[02:44:41.680 --> 02:44:45.840]  lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't

[02:45:04.480 --> 02:45:09.440]  percent off but we make only like five ten dollars on higher marked up and stuff we're making like two
[02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:14.000]  dollars on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving a ton of it okay but you move a couple
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:17.840]  hundred thousand dollars or something and you get twenty thousand dollars that doesn't pay for all the
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:21.440]  infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers the crew so we need to sell millions and millions and

[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:28.800]  hi alex how are you you know i'm doing okay myself but man we're gonna see world government
[02:48:28.800 --> 02:48:32.800]  the antichrist brain chips third of the world population kills it's all gonna happen like the
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:37.520]  bible says there's no doubt about it now it's pretty amazing and demon possessions exploding
[02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:44.080]  everywhere it's pretty pretty pretty crazy well it just makes you wonder back when the guys were
[02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:49.520]  right in the bible god was you know downloading all that information to him what in the world they
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:56.080]  could have possibly thought about all of that yeah imagine the stuff they were seeing like yeah
[02:48:56.080 --> 02:49:03.440]  yeah and anybody that doesn't believe the bible is insane because it's all right there you just
[02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:09.600]  don't want to believe it so it's been coming for a long time i've been watching it since i was a
[02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:15.280]  teenager and even before i was born again christian i had a basic faith in god and i could see it
[02:49:15.280 --> 02:49:22.080]  coming you know donald trump is a work in progress god is working on him spiritually you can see it
[02:49:22.080 --> 02:49:27.600]  that's obvious he's made a lot of progress in the right direction and i really believe that god is
[02:49:27.600 --> 02:49:34.400]  the one who decides who's going to be uh you know our leaders and he's put him into place
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:38.880]  for this particularly oh yeah exactly you know it's god's hand on it because look how satan's
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:45.920]  behaving oh yeah and i you know i even people i talked to out here that just have an even a
[02:49:45.920 --> 02:49:51.680]  basic belief in god they can see it and they can see there's something about god's handy work
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:57.440]  in what's going on with donald trump and they will all agree that if he doesn't get reelected
[02:49:58.320 --> 02:50:04.720]  we're cooked and if he does get reelected then we're just cooked four more years later basically
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:09.440]  well as you say the bible is an example of an an allegory because things repeat there's many
[02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:16.400]  anti christ spirits you look at trump the bible's full of god using a king that wasn't even jewish
[02:50:16.400 --> 02:50:21.680]  or wasn't even christian to do good but trump is a christian now he's he's not a lover of evil
[02:50:21.680 --> 02:50:26.800]  he's not a lover of hurting innocent people he doesn't have a satan experience uh but but but
[02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:32.000]  the fact is he's the perfect type person who doesn't care about the system and political
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:36.640]  correctness to go up against him and that's how the god works in mysterious ways but populists
[02:50:36.640 --> 02:50:41.280]  are getting elected everywhere and and and its humanity's desire to not be under this system
[02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:48.960]  it's a normal manifestation uh and so absolutely uh the left's always like you christians are all
[02:50:48.960 --> 02:50:54.160]  about how you're morally good but then trump's not perfect god hates hypocrites trump's never been
[02:50:54.160 --> 02:51:00.160]  a hypocrite and christians get that he supports christians he's the only guy that goes to pro
[02:51:00.160 --> 02:51:05.760]  life rallies he's trying to save the unborn his fruits are way better than these so-called
[02:51:05.760 --> 02:51:09.520]  politicians that tell you how christian they are all day like mit romney but then
[02:51:09.520 --> 02:51:15.280]  and his works are dead there's nothing there he works for the system the system love mit romney
[02:51:15.280 --> 02:51:21.280]  they don't like trump well don't get me started on that because mit romney is not a christian he is
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:27.280]  a Mormon and anybody who's ever done any kind of research into it knows that they're two completely
[02:51:27.280 --> 02:51:34.800]  different uh ideological systems of thought and belief but you know the way i look at it is that
[02:51:34.800 --> 02:51:40.800]  we have been taught in the bible to fight the good fight all the way to the end even though we know
[02:51:40.800 --> 02:51:46.800]  what the outcome is going to be we are still put here to fight for what's good and for what's right
[02:51:46.800 --> 02:51:54.240]  because it is a test to see if we can handle real power at the next level exactly we're going to be
[02:51:54.240 --> 02:51:59.040]  ruling and reigning with christ for a thousand years that's right now as far as this mark of the
[02:51:59.040 --> 02:52:05.040]  beast thing that we've seen coming for so very long and they've um you know they've brought up
[02:52:05.040 --> 02:52:12.240]  about three or four generations now of of grooming people mentally of handicapping them not only
[02:52:12.240 --> 02:52:18.560]  mentally but physically and hormonally to be able to get to the point where they can put into
[02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:23.120]  place everything they want and people will go right along with it that's right they've celebrated
[02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:31.200]  being fallen being diseased being corrupt exactly they are in full on rebellion towards god which
[02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:37.360]  is exactly what he says is going to be happening at the end even to the point that they're willing
[02:52:37.360 --> 02:52:43.920]  to go headlong into perdition just for the sake of boarding god and they don't realize that once
[02:52:43.920 --> 02:52:49.440]  they get there that's when they'll know what they've actually done to themselves they haven't done
[02:52:49.440 --> 02:52:54.640]  anything to hurt god all they've done is put themselves into the lake of fire for eternity
[02:52:54.640 --> 02:53:00.640]  well let's expand on that i only covered this once because it was so shocking that it almost
[02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:05.120]  feels obscene to even show people though we need to show people they now have drag time story time
[02:53:05.120 --> 02:53:10.720]  all over the us and it's it's like a book they have rollouts to prepare people for pedophilia
[02:53:10.720 --> 02:53:14.960]  they admit that and they now officially say no we're preparing people for sex with children
[02:53:14.960 --> 02:53:21.360]  and the library associations endorsed it i mean this is in the news the children now they go ride
[02:53:21.360 --> 02:53:28.720]  horsey and little boys and girls go and get on the laps of men and then hump the men i mean so
[02:53:28.720 --> 02:53:34.320]  now it's just unbelievable it men dressed as clowns god bless you sue i we're showing it on
[02:53:34.320 --> 02:53:39.440]  screen there's photos even worse there's video of the humping the children get up and then ride them
[02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:44.320]  and the men are like i mean it's just and when you've seen the little kids at the gay pride parades
[02:53:44.320 --> 02:53:49.200]  shaking their ass almost naked and the men humping them i mean i can't even show this to you folks
[02:53:50.800 --> 02:53:54.880]  so used to the old creepy fat perverts you know we get in trouble at the park but now
[02:53:55.840 --> 02:54:00.560]  they laugh it's like oh the rebellion is so fun that's it's all they have is that evil spirit
[02:54:00.560 --> 02:54:08.480]  just give me your children the effector shots of that big old fat guy with a bunch of little
[02:54:08.480 --> 02:54:12.160]  kids they're trying to get away from him and he's laughing just quick because the mothers bring him
[02:54:12.160 --> 02:54:17.200]  to him mothers are like oh used to you being a white van now here are my kids and the women just
[02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:23.920]  ride they go because it there he's making that that piranha face that eel face
[02:54:26.320 --> 02:54:31.840]  oh my god this is total satanic invasion all right let's go ahead he's been home the longest now
[02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:36.240]  let's go to Roberto in Illinois Roberto thanks for calling welcome
[02:54:37.840 --> 02:54:41.280]  how you doing Alex thanks for taking my call i'm pretty freaked out by
[02:54:41.280 --> 02:54:45.360]  they're going to put in the malls brain chip implant centers next year or nylon
[02:54:46.240 --> 02:54:52.240]  actually uh that's my point i still see a scenario where uh the rollout with these chips could be
[02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:59.440]  humanity humanity's last line of defense against a complete ai takeover he did say himself that he
[02:54:59.440 --> 02:55:05.600]  was going against uh the uh implementation of ai in the beginning calling it out putting it out
[02:55:05.600 --> 02:55:10.320]  there and now the oh you think he might be saying it to freak people out early ahead of their
[02:55:10.320 --> 02:55:13.920]  conditioning because you know they're already selling it he thinks he's saying it early to wake
[02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:20.160]  us up god actually to give us a weapon against a i mean like like the matrix uh the movie the
[02:55:20.160 --> 02:55:24.960]  matrix you got the human resistance going on the ground and they're using a technology would
[02:55:24.960 --> 02:55:31.200]  that allows them to go in and out of the matrix to combat them and try to win back humanity that's
[02:55:31.200 --> 02:55:35.840]  oh they do have wires in the back of their head this is the same implant as the matrix because
[02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:40.880]  they already have these in the 70s plug-ins and so it is a matrix but in fact that's the proper
[02:55:40.880 --> 02:55:46.400]  term elon musk is preparing to put matrix plug-ins in everybody's heads you're saying musk is trying
[02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:53.040]  to prepare his own army for people to go into cyberspace uh probably or at least kind of give
[02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:57.840]  humans a chance against a complete uh machine takeover you know what i'm saying that make us
[02:55:57.840 --> 02:56:03.520]  just as smart sure here's the problem our whole genetics and everything is the the six senses
[02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:09.040]  the sixth the most important the one we're not supposed to talk about but these neural systems
[02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:15.120]  track our brain and control our brain there are no senses hooking up electrodes to the to the to
[02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:21.360]  the brain's tissue there's only a electrochemical manipulation and stimuli uh and so what i'm
[02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:25.840]  saying is these systems are only one way like they can help you not have a seizure they can
[02:56:25.840 --> 02:56:31.120]  monitor your heart rate whatever but they can also do stimulator control you which they admit
[02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:36.400]  so so so that's why this is so dangerous one last thing do you believe is there rolling it out for
[02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:40.560]  the public next year that there's already people out there with these chips in the brain kind of
[02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:47.360]  uh like the they're they're definitely they're definitely military that that have it i'm just
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:54.240]  going to leave it that i've had family that was 15 years ago briefed uh in special operations that
[02:56:54.240 --> 02:56:58.880]  they were going to be getting their chips as officers and uh and that those that volunteer
[02:56:58.880 --> 02:57:03.440]  will be getting brain chips and that they should see their uh commanding officer about the surgeries
[02:57:05.280 --> 02:57:10.880]  okay well i thank you for your time alex is wanting to get your uh take on uh my scenario
[02:57:10.880 --> 02:57:15.440]  yeah well that family members out of the military now he told me about it said i could talk about
[02:57:15.440 --> 02:57:21.120]  it but i didn't say his name but he got called in about it almost got called before the man
[02:57:21.840 --> 02:57:26.480]  and then later didn't get his promotions they believed at the end he was in the military
[02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:33.760]  35 years of the army uh because of him telling me that yeah folks this is not a joke okay
[02:57:37.360 --> 02:57:41.360]  we'll be right back info wars dot com news wars dot com tomorrow's news today
[02:57:44.800 --> 02:57:48.800]  let's talk to marcus in new york marcus here on the air thanks for holding hey i just want to
[02:57:48.800 --> 02:57:53.440]  say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york city and
[02:57:53.440 --> 02:57:58.160]  one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons
[02:57:58.160 --> 02:58:02.960]  are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that
[02:58:02.960 --> 02:58:07.920]  they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys
[02:58:07.920 --> 02:58:11.360]  into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he could be defeated other
[02:58:11.360 --> 02:58:15.280]  than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i
[02:58:15.280 --> 02:58:19.680]  just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived

[03:01:19.040 --> 03:01:25.600]  in florida william you're on the air go ahead good afternoon alex thanks for taking my call
[03:01:25.600 --> 03:01:30.480]  thanks for calling well what do you think about what's going on right now well um
[03:01:30.480 --> 03:01:36.640]  wow so much is going on sometimes mind-boggling before i get into my my points i want to plug
[03:01:36.640 --> 03:01:41.120]  a couple products first off uh the immune wall you don't mention it very much it helps keep me
[03:01:41.680 --> 03:01:48.560]  uh healthy uh i work in an environment where i'm exposed to the the public and of course you
[03:01:48.560 --> 03:01:53.600]  know everything that comes along with that stay healthy with that and the super wound gel amazing
[03:01:53.600 --> 03:02:01.760]  stuff well thank you i just for those that don't know you've got things like emergency and you've
[03:02:01.760 --> 03:02:07.200]  got things like airport or whatever it's called that you know that people take and and those things
[03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:13.440]  have some good things in them when we did immune wall i'm like what's three times stronger than
[03:02:13.440 --> 03:02:18.880]  any other immune support formula they're like okay we can make this and so anything we make is just
[03:02:18.880 --> 03:02:25.840]  shocked full of the very best things and yes the super silver wound gel is a national brand
[03:02:25.840 --> 03:02:34.240]  patented fda approved used at hospitals used over the counter 40 a tube we have to pay like
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:39.360]  13 bucks or something a tube so when we're selling it at 1776 right now it's already a
[03:02:39.360 --> 03:02:44.480]  best seller uh for things like that that is just an insane deal in fact that was a mistake they made
[03:02:44.480 --> 03:02:50.240]  over there in the in the warehouse but that's okay the the the sales still going for super silver
[03:02:50.240 --> 03:02:56.480]  folks don't know it's like gloves put a tiny bit on your hands rub it and then it's a preemptive wall
[03:02:57.120 --> 03:03:02.560]  of the of the of the strongest silver allowed by the fda over the counter now let me be very clear
[03:03:02.560 --> 03:03:09.600]  do not ingest it okay it's very toxic but i mean it's weaponized it's the strongest silver over
[03:03:09.600 --> 03:03:15.120]  the counter but bacteria viruses it's approved and proven to kill them better than a hammer
[03:03:15.120 --> 03:03:19.760]  since you mentioned it my friend what experience have you had uh with the super silver wound gel
[03:03:21.280 --> 03:03:27.280]  well everything from minor burns to uh actually uh take out a little sloppy in the kitchen one day
[03:03:27.280 --> 03:03:32.160]  and i normally turn my when i'm chopping stuff i turn the knife away from me and i didn't do that
[03:03:32.160 --> 03:03:35.600]  i was in a hurry because something was on the stove anyway i turned back and i reached for the knife
[03:03:35.600 --> 03:03:40.320]  and i cut my uh cut my finger right down to the bone it was bleeding pretty good and i put the
[03:03:40.320 --> 03:03:46.240]  silver super silver wound gel on that and wrapped it of course and uh in less than i would say
[03:03:46.960 --> 03:03:52.000]  less than four hours the pain was gone and in a day the the deepest part of the cut was already
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:56.800]  healing up well i don't i don't want to take your time away so we're going to come back
[03:03:56.800 --> 03:04:01.520]  and spend a few more minutes with you about your specifics of microchips tack and experiments and
[03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:07.200]  where all that's going william but it is the best wound gel out there and i've tried to
[03:04:07.200 --> 03:04:11.760]  haggle them down the price but after the patents and the fd approval took them like nine years
[03:04:11.760 --> 03:04:15.040]  and again i guess i can plug the name of the company they don't even mind if i do but i don't
[03:04:15.040 --> 03:04:20.720]  want to be harassed this is the thing used in hospitals so we're very very proud of it
[03:04:20.720 --> 03:04:26.720]  that is a mistake to be selling it at 1776 but i said all of the supplements you would be at that
[03:04:26.720 --> 03:04:34.160]  price well except for uh dna force we obviously can't do that there's like like i said 38 dollars
[03:04:34.160 --> 03:04:37.680]  of product or something in it and then after the rest of the cost it's like 50 dollars a bottle
[03:04:37.680 --> 03:04:43.120]  for us people say who the hell has that i mean nobody puts 50 dollars a product of the bottle
[03:04:43.120 --> 03:04:48.080]  we do it's like our turmeric it's not just turmeric it's concentrated turmeric so thanks for the
[03:04:48.080 --> 03:04:51.840]  plug william yeah we're proud of the products i'm gonna come back make your point and we'll go to
[03:04:51.840 --> 03:04:58.000]  the ghost report it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public
[03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:02.800]  square the other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach
[03:05:02.800 --> 03:05:07.840]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire
[03:05:07.840 --> 03:05:11.760]  that's not being funded by secrets foreign government it is completely independent of all
[03:05:11.760 --> 03:05:17.200]  that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom
[03:05:17.200 --> 03:05:21.520]  of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning
[03:05:21.520 --> 03:05:26.240]  of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because
[03:05:26.240 --> 03:05:29.840]  this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've
[03:05:29.840 --> 03:05:34.000]  mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to
[03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:39.280]  control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or hear and
[03:05:39.280 --> 03:05:44.080]  the info wars audience has broken through that the uh that they are the bridge from the founding
[03:05:44.080 --> 03:05:47.840]  to the modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an
[03:05:47.840 --> 03:06:03.760]  unprecedented onslaught of the platforming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you
[03:06:03.760 --> 03:06:14.560]  oh yeah
[03:06:20.960 --> 03:06:28.880]  that's right
[03:06:28.880 --> 03:06:34.080]  daddy was a preacher but mama was a go-go girl all right william in florida
[03:06:36.080 --> 03:06:40.400]  uh your veteran marine wanted to comment on microchips tech and experiments go ahead place
[03:06:41.760 --> 03:06:45.920]  yeah alex uh first off i'm not like blooming ball and i'm stealing glory never been in combat
[03:06:45.920 --> 03:06:53.680]  but i did serve 13 years in the uh united states marine corps in uh about 1992 or so long before
[03:06:53.680 --> 03:07:01.200]  23 and me and all these other dna things and military started cataloging dna uh moving forward
[03:07:01.200 --> 03:07:08.160]  around 1996 i was being promoted from uh sergeant to the staff ranks the staff sergeant and i had a
[03:07:08.160 --> 03:07:13.920]  conversation with a colonel lieutenant colonel who was being promoted to colonel and he had
[03:07:13.920 --> 03:07:19.040]  received this assignment he was going to the pentagon he went up there to tour his new uh new
[03:07:19.040 --> 03:07:25.520]  office and talk to you know his new staff and he came back and said hey colonel how you like
[03:07:25.520 --> 03:07:29.200]  what's going to be doing in the pentagon it's going to be a stepping stone till you're picking
[03:07:29.200 --> 03:07:35.200]  up your first star he said absolutely not and i asked him why and he said because they're
[03:07:35.200 --> 03:07:44.480]  experimenting with implanting ships in troops brains and that was in 1996 you've already mentioned
[03:07:44.480 --> 03:07:51.040]  this from previous calls but none of this is none of this is new they're just rolling it out
[03:07:51.040 --> 03:07:59.440]  and it all ties in to the 5g and one last thing uh when the uh psychiatrist was uh testifying
[03:07:59.440 --> 03:08:04.960]  before congress and ted cruz was kind of finished finishing up his remarks and the camera kind of
[03:08:04.960 --> 03:08:12.000]  pulled back and it showed her on the next next to ted cruz uh look at her body language she looks
[03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:18.640]  scared to death and that that's pretty much it right there alex you're right in fact i felt like
[03:08:18.640 --> 03:08:23.440]  today i should just drop everything and play nothing but that guy's testimony because you're
[03:08:23.440 --> 03:08:29.280]  right i i stayed up late last night because it happened tuesday and i got busy we talked about
[03:08:29.280 --> 03:08:34.320]  it some wednesday and then rob do our news records like you need to watch this so i went home last night
[03:08:34.320 --> 03:08:40.000]  and watched like two hours of it and the guy's so dead on and you're right herono is lacking
[03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:45.280]  scared because she's figuring out oh my god they're still in the election for us she's actually
[03:08:45.280 --> 03:08:49.680]  because she's been up there attacking me saying i'm making all this up because she's she was in
[03:08:49.680 --> 03:08:53.120]  one of the committee hearings when i was there she's on a bunch of committees going oh that
[03:08:53.120 --> 03:08:58.560]  conspiracy theorist was here he's a lying idiot and and and and now the fact that they've had google
[03:08:58.560 --> 03:09:02.960]  lie to them because i guarantee a herono can't balance her own checkbook and the woman's dumber
[03:09:02.960 --> 03:09:08.800]  in a box of rocks she's hearing all this from a top computer scientist psychiatrist you name it with
[03:09:08.800 --> 03:09:14.880]  darpa and she's there really getting scared and i wish ted cruise was smarter because i know he's
[03:09:14.880 --> 03:09:22.000]  super smart but he was getting blown away by the basic facts that google is more important than the
[03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:27.760]  phone company now for just being able to index things imagine if google started not showing you
[03:09:27.760 --> 03:09:33.200]  businesses on a map if they didn't pay them money if they didn't show you a road or a gas station
[03:09:33.200 --> 03:09:38.480]  or you'd say well that's fraud you're gonna drop off a cliff but see that's the power they've got
[03:09:39.040 --> 03:09:44.000]  and they're starting to abuse the living hell out of it god bless you william my preach let's
[03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:48.800]  go back briefly don't don't hang up william actually my cousin told me about this he was an
[03:09:48.800 --> 03:09:55.760]  officer in the army 35 years and his dad had been an army officer and this is no secret he
[03:09:56.320 --> 03:10:00.960]  he was a part of pre-delta force groups you know we've always had army assassination teams inside
[03:10:00.960 --> 03:10:05.440]  the us but i mean let's just say dialed into everything and the fact that they got taken in
[03:10:05.440 --> 03:10:09.920]  but there was a lot of officers there and told you're all getting your chip in the next year
[03:10:09.920 --> 03:10:14.720]  and by the way if you want to be more advanced you know for a project you're gonna get brain
[03:10:14.720 --> 03:10:20.000]  augmentation that means chips in the brain but don't worry we've perfected it he told me said just
[03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:26.320]  don't say my name he got in big trouble and wouldn't he still my friend and loves me but actually
[03:10:26.320 --> 03:10:31.760]  will not even talk to me now like he'll say very nice weather and that's it in like 15 years i've
[03:10:31.760 --> 03:10:36.560]  seen him like six seven times more than that at funerals and stuff he won't even talk to me because
[03:10:36.560 --> 03:10:42.880]  he obviously got told you're dead if you talk again but imagine the level of this that that that
[03:10:42.880 --> 03:10:48.400]  this officer you knew comes back and goes no we're getting ready to put brains and chips and
[03:10:48.400 --> 03:10:53.360]  trips brains and it's not that chips couldn't help somebody that had a medical problem it's that
[03:10:53.360 --> 03:10:59.680]  there's the evil behind it and the trojan horse and just how crazy that is that this is the point
[03:10:59.680 --> 03:11:05.280]  we've gotten to and now Elon Musk is gonna roll it out at malls and you know they're gonna tell
[03:11:05.280 --> 03:11:10.320]  the kids and everybody's gonna be begging their parents it's just a quick surgery dad mom let me
[03:11:10.320 --> 03:11:19.920]  have the brain surgery no my god this is insane william did he did he say anything else to you
[03:11:19.920 --> 03:11:29.920]  about the brain chips he he talked around a lot of stuff and uh he you know he as he was you know
[03:11:29.920 --> 03:11:36.400]  confiding in me he felt the need to pull back because obviously this was classified information
[03:11:36.400 --> 03:11:42.160]  and i didn't have the need to know so to speak um but he told me incompetency get your get your
[03:11:42.160 --> 03:11:48.720]  house together and get out let's see that's the evil of the globalist they do evil stuff which
[03:11:48.720 --> 03:11:54.320]  makes the good men leave the military but then i get again though how do you compromise and go
[03:11:54.320 --> 03:11:59.120]  ahead and be in the labs put chips and brains do all this saying i'm going to do this so i'm in here
[03:11:59.120 --> 03:12:04.080]  but you're committing the evil i it's a hell of a thing to ask a man to commit evil for a longer
[03:12:04.080 --> 03:12:09.440]  term good and it almost always turns to bad but i just don't know what to do and all ties together
[03:12:09.440 --> 03:12:15.040]  alix because you know of course you know as california is going taking away the rights of
[03:12:15.040 --> 03:12:20.960]  parents to even say no to a vaccine they're not going to be able to say no to a chip either
[03:12:22.080 --> 03:12:27.360]  you just said it it's all about getting rid of parental consent california's made it what legal
[03:12:27.360 --> 03:12:32.640]  11 year olds can have an abortion or get vaccines without parental consent in california
[03:12:34.640 --> 03:12:40.320]  it's insane and demonic damn right it's demonic god bless you brother well the bible's being
[03:12:40.320 --> 03:12:44.480]  proven true we're gonna have to go through some hellish stuff but jesus christ is on the other
[03:12:44.480 --> 03:12:49.760]  side folks this evil is not going to go on forever like a forest fire doesn't go on forever
[03:12:49.760 --> 03:12:54.960]  a heart attack doesn't go on forever a broke leg hurt and don't go on forever anything bad doesn't
[03:12:54.960 --> 03:13:04.480]  go on forever and it's going to be rough though man god almighty world government satan all of it
[03:13:04.480 --> 03:13:08.400]  it's all happening now and it's just going to be rough and i don't know god's master plan and
[03:13:08.400 --> 03:13:14.000]  you know why god's putting all these nationalists and patriots in now and maybe you know maybe we
[03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:18.240]  get a reprieve and it takes a hundred years for the anti-craft to come in but i the enemy though
[03:13:18.240 --> 03:13:22.560]  seems to know humanity's pushing back so they're pushing back even harder to get their world
[03:13:22.560 --> 03:13:30.720]  government system in and let's go back to your calls who's been on the long stare that'd be
[03:13:30.720 --> 03:13:41.040]  that'd be ghost report in utah thanks for calling ghost report yes sir hi welcome hi okay so bluetooth
[03:13:41.040 --> 03:13:47.200]  is incredibly easy to hack and this information was made in mainstream news articles last year
[03:13:48.160 --> 03:13:53.520]  they must have already created a backdoor into this this is going to be effective only for
[03:13:53.520 --> 03:14:01.280]  paraplegics and then it's just going to learn the ai off of the rest of us and it's going to shut down
[03:14:01.280 --> 03:14:06.720]  i was about to say i mean you know everything breaks toasters microwaves computers cell phones
[03:14:06.720 --> 03:14:10.960]  why would you stick a cell phone in your brain and then connect to these people it sounds like
[03:14:10.960 --> 03:14:14.720]  the most it sounds like putting yourself on a woodchipper i mean it's just it's so stupid
[03:14:14.720 --> 03:14:24.160]  it yes you were bringing a friend um you know i think most of them are already
[03:14:24.160 --> 03:14:28.560]  lost at times rolled out so there's no parental consent you're right about
[03:14:32.560 --> 03:14:38.640]  but imagine 2 000 years ago john the revelator on the isle of pat most
[03:14:38.640 --> 03:14:45.200]  has a revelation and it was like three days long hallucination basically and he sees all this
[03:14:45.200 --> 03:14:51.920]  he describes like flying metal insects that drop eggs and then there's there's there's there's fires
[03:14:51.920 --> 03:14:57.360]  as big as mountains and it's nuclear weapons and and and the and and and you know just all the
[03:14:57.360 --> 03:15:01.840]  thing and like world government the giant beast you worship and marks the hand and had to buy and
[03:15:01.840 --> 03:15:06.800]  sell and everyone in the world watches the image of the beast that that's television or that's
[03:15:06.800 --> 03:15:11.680]  that's a project i mean you read this now and you're like god how the hell did that god wasn't
[03:15:11.680 --> 03:15:16.880]  going to put us into this without a cheat sheet because we've got to have free will so god's got
[03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:22.800]  to say okay well i'll put you here and i'll put your spirit in the body and your body will be all
[03:15:22.800 --> 03:15:26.720]  your ancestors genetic learning i'll even let you cheat that way and get all their instincts
[03:15:26.720 --> 03:15:33.600]  and learning so that your spirit as this gets more serious is in a body suit that's got all
[03:15:33.600 --> 03:15:38.160]  these experiences and then hopefully i'll give you the cheat sheet and hopefully you listen
[03:15:38.160 --> 03:15:44.320]  so when all this happens the people have a choice and then now we're here thank you so much a few

[03:17:57.760 --> 03:18:01.760]  to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york
[03:18:01.760 --> 03:18:06.480]  city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the
[03:18:06.480 --> 03:18:11.600]  neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[03:18:11.600 --> 03:18:16.160]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean
[03:18:16.160 --> 03:18:19.840]  if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he could be
[03:18:19.840 --> 03:18:23.840]  defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the

[03:20:34.960 --> 03:20:36.080]  he gave up on me
[03:20:38.880 --> 03:20:42.160]  all right going back to your phone calls and matt bracken's taking over so much is that a good
[03:20:42.160 --> 03:20:48.640]  tip it's it's all on m4s.com and m4s.com is under attack because the globalists don't like the fact
[03:20:48.640 --> 03:20:54.160]  that we're standing up to them we're thinking about the bible and jesus christ and why all the
[03:20:54.160 --> 03:20:59.840]  religions the system wants it banned and attacks it and then lies about it and then buys up all
[03:20:59.840 --> 03:21:04.720]  the preachers to make them fakes to turn people away from god and it's because not just revelation
[03:21:04.720 --> 03:21:09.760]  predicting all of this and not just the fact that we are made in the image of god and how heavy that
[03:21:09.760 --> 03:21:18.560]  is and we were seated on this planet by our creator but that would you respect a creator
[03:21:18.560 --> 03:21:22.400]  that had omnipresence and then put you in a position like that if that person wouldn't go
[03:21:22.400 --> 03:21:26.880]  through it it'd be like having an officer in a military who wasn't going to go with you on a
[03:21:26.880 --> 03:21:34.160]  mission or who'd never been in combat jesus christ came here limited himself allowed people to
[03:21:34.160 --> 03:21:44.240]  attack him torture him murder him because god didn't have guilt because god was omnipresent
[03:21:44.240 --> 03:21:51.920]  envisioned this whole plan but it was only fair the minute god developed this plan
[03:21:54.400 --> 03:21:58.480]  christ was going to come down here christ was going to be perfect christ was going to be tortured to
[03:21:58.480 --> 03:22:04.320]  death because god's like hey i'll go down and i'll get tortured to death i'll feel it all i'll let
[03:22:04.320 --> 03:22:13.440]  it myself down to a person down to my children and i'll i'll do what is going to happen to my
[03:22:13.440 --> 03:22:19.040]  children you think god likes watching all these babies get aborted you think god likes
[03:22:19.040 --> 03:22:24.240]  watching all this devil worship every part of this is about the filing children because of the
[03:22:24.240 --> 03:22:32.640]  perfect image and the prototype of what god's creating they're holy it's like in the road with
[03:22:32.640 --> 03:22:42.560]  ego mortensen and robert deval robert deval says that's a god you got right there pure real loving
[03:22:42.560 --> 03:22:48.720]  innocent the whole potential of humanity you could make a whole new world with children that's a god
[03:22:48.720 --> 03:23:04.160]  but if you're not a god oh the satan to say everybody's a god but they always debate you down to some
[03:23:04.800 --> 03:23:11.040]  no no no we're not gods we're made the image of god but we have the potential to be able to merge
[03:23:11.040 --> 03:23:22.640]  with god merger with the deity but before we could ever do that we have to be pure
[03:23:24.400 --> 03:23:28.320]  doesn't mean any of us are pure and without sin but our soul has to be
[03:23:28.320 --> 03:23:34.240]  wanting god and being we have to be tempted we have to go through trial tribulations to prove
[03:23:34.240 --> 03:23:41.920]  to ourselves our own free will we're not proving any of this to god we're deciding who we are well

[03:24:45.520 --> 03:24:47.520]  and in god's plan there's lots of killing
[03:24:50.880 --> 03:24:53.280]  and we don't ever start the fights we finish them so
[03:24:53.280 --> 03:24:56.160]  though it's death the globalist looking for better i'll find plenty of it

[03:30:29.520 --> 03:30:35.120]  some action from congress from the president from the white house to do something about the big
[03:30:35.120 --> 03:30:40.400]  tech censorship before the 2020 elections when it's going to be so key it was info wars presents

[03:31:58.480 --> 03:32:03.840]  wars model is a self-fulfilling self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free
[03:32:03.840 --> 03:32:08.720]  speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another it is the
[03:32:08.720 --> 03:32:14.480]  only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach it is the one model that says
[03:32:14.480 --> 03:32:20.160]  here's a way to have a self-supporting self-sustaining self-structured little d democratic structure
[03:32:20.160 --> 03:32:24.960]  that because the audience determines what content goes up the audience determines what audience is
[03:32:24.960 --> 03:32:29.600]  ultimately reached by their choices and supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends
[03:32:29.600 --> 03:32:33.760]  there whatever it is whether it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products that they like
[03:32:33.760 --> 03:32:38.240]  and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that
[03:32:38.240 --> 03:32:43.600]  and at the same time support press support speech support letting the audience choose what news they
[03:32:43.600 --> 03:32:48.160]  want to see and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate american democratic expression
[03:32:48.160 --> 03:32:52.320]  and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets
[03:32:56.880 --> 03:32:59.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:32:59.520 --> 03:33:01.520]  oh
[03:33:12.640 --> 03:33:15.520]  the west is the best
[03:33:15.520 --> 03:33:24.000]  the west is the best
[03:33:29.360 --> 03:33:31.360]  get him and we'll do the rest
[03:33:35.440 --> 03:33:42.400]  the killer walked before dawn and put his boots on and then he walked on down the hall
[03:33:42.400 --> 03:33:48.320]  and back it's taken over here in a moment i i just wanted to
[03:33:49.680 --> 03:33:52.880]  play this clip it's up on info wars dot com kit daniel's posted it
[03:33:53.440 --> 03:33:58.880]  illan omar just shut down pennsylvania having a few hours ago she just like she's god she just
[03:33:58.880 --> 03:34:05.680]  stops it and wanders out in the street and takes over you know as a somali journalist who was
[03:34:06.400 --> 03:34:11.120]  born in somalia but lives in canada the articles on info wars dot com as well she went over there
[03:34:11.120 --> 03:34:17.200]  to prove there's no violence was killed within one week just thought i'd mention that most dangerous
[03:34:17.200 --> 03:34:24.400]  country in the world because the slavery hub for a thousand years of the muslims for slaves from
[03:34:24.400 --> 03:34:30.720]  the middle east north africa and then all the way out to indonesia that's why you go to like
[03:34:30.720 --> 03:34:34.480]  those asian countries and there's like the samoans and people that are part black because
[03:34:34.480 --> 03:34:41.280]  black people were enslaved in kenya and other areas and shipped out journalist travels to
[03:34:41.280 --> 03:34:46.080]  illan omar's homeland to prove somalia is beautiful get killed by terrorist
[03:34:48.720 --> 03:34:54.320]  yes we're not joking so that's what's going on there but here's illan omar stops traffic
[03:34:54.320 --> 03:35:01.840]  in busy street to slam trump and his supporters here's that video we have said this president is
[03:35:01.840 --> 03:35:10.160]  racist we have condemned his racist remarks i believe he is fascist i want to remind people
[03:35:10.160 --> 03:35:16.400]  that this is what this president and his supporters have turned our country that is supposed to be a
[03:35:16.400 --> 03:35:24.960]  country where we allow democratic debate and dissent to take place and so this is not about me this
[03:35:24.960 --> 03:35:33.200]  is about us fighting for what this country truly should be but people criticizing her and disagreeing
[03:35:33.200 --> 03:35:40.160]  with her that's not stopping her and you know trump here's the chance we'll play a clip this will go
[03:35:40.160 --> 03:35:46.080]  to bracken whether they're saying you know ship her out of the country get rid of her and you know
[03:35:46.080 --> 03:35:50.640]  we we have a petition on infowars.com it's on whitehouse.gov to have her investigated for
[03:35:50.640 --> 03:35:55.200]  burying her brother being her fraudulently i think if she's here fraudulently got citizenship fraudulently
[03:35:55.200 --> 03:35:59.040]  she should be shipped out of the country i mean that's in the constitution uh but trump's now
[03:35:59.040 --> 03:36:04.960]  saying it's a little too much to say ship her back uh and and so so he's now disavowing and
[03:36:04.960 --> 03:36:10.160]  saying oh the crowd did that no no trump you you were supporting it and the point is people are
[03:36:10.160 --> 03:36:19.200]  sick of hearing how bad we are when we're not here's the clip we've got all the enthusiasm
[03:36:19.200 --> 03:36:24.880]  they're fighting each other they've gone so far left nobody wants to even think about it
[03:36:24.880 --> 03:36:35.280]  so representative omar blamed the united states for the terrorist attacks on our country saying
[03:36:35.280 --> 03:36:46.640]  that terrorism is a reaction to our involvement in other people's affairs she smeared us service
[03:36:46.640 --> 03:36:53.520]  members involved in black hawk down in other words she slandered the brave americans who were
[03:36:53.520 --> 03:37:03.840]  trying to keep peace in somalia they're protecting the um mission the september 11th attacks on our
[03:37:03.840 --> 03:37:13.520]  homeland saying some people did something i don't think so some people did something yeah some people
[03:37:13.520 --> 03:37:22.640]  did something all right she pleaded for compassion for isis recruits attempting to join the terrorist
[03:37:22.640 --> 03:37:30.320]  organization she was looking for companies ship her back man damn omar left that americans speak
[03:37:30.320 --> 03:37:39.040]  of al qaeda in a menacing tone and remarked that you don't say america with this intensity
[03:37:39.040 --> 03:37:47.360]  you say al qaeda makes you proud al qaeda makes you proud it does you don't speak that she said
[03:37:47.360 --> 03:37:53.280]  that she hates hearing people say america why the hell do you want to come there's a piece of
[03:37:53.280 --> 03:38:03.040]  filth when asked whether she supported al qaeda that's our enemy that's our enemy they are a very

[03:38:16.240 --> 03:38:20.240]  trump's breaking the back of political correctness i think he's showing it's okay to get in these
[03:38:20.240 --> 03:38:24.240]  people's faces when they say our that we're killing people at the border and that we've got
[03:38:24.240 --> 03:38:29.040]  concentration camps when it's nicer than public schools i mean i mean i'm really refreshed by
[03:38:29.040 --> 03:38:34.640]  what trump's doing and i'm kind of sad to see him back off now and say oh no don't say ship her back
[03:38:34.640 --> 03:38:40.480]  if she came here fraudulently ship her america hating ass back to that that that that that
[03:38:40.480 --> 03:38:46.720]  road warrior hellhole that samalia yeah i'm not i'm not too disappointed with him disavowing
[03:38:46.720 --> 03:38:52.240]  send her back because that implies the government is just going to pluck her off the street and
[03:38:52.240 --> 03:38:58.320]  drop her in a helicopter which personally i wouldn't have a big problem with that um but
[03:38:58.320 --> 03:39:03.680]  we wouldn't want her dropping into the atlantic ocean though no but you know i i call them i call
[03:39:03.680 --> 03:39:10.240]  the four of them the jihad squad because you know they always say the tequilla muslims always say
[03:39:10.240 --> 03:39:16.800]  oh jihad doesn't mean violence or terrorism jihad means this this personal inner struggle to make
[03:39:16.800 --> 03:39:21.920]  yourself a better human being so they should embrace being called the jihad squad you this is
[03:39:21.920 --> 03:39:28.240]  sort of like reversal insky make them live up to their own to their own ideals no i agree
[03:39:28.240 --> 03:39:32.480]  and trump wants to keep her around because he's hurt the democrats so bad that we don't want to
[03:39:32.480 --> 03:39:38.160]  fry her quite yet we want to keep aoc and illan around for a long time because they might even
[03:39:38.160 --> 03:39:43.120]  be able to beat google trying to fix the election like google's got search engine rigging well we've
[03:39:43.120 --> 03:39:50.160]  got illan and and aoc yeah this is absolutely 4d chess and if you're playing chess um you know
[03:39:50.800 --> 03:39:56.000]  one person can look at chess and say i don't want to lose a single pawn and another person and yet
[03:39:56.000 --> 03:40:01.120]  that person's never going to win a chess game somebody might in a certain case actually you
[03:40:01.120 --> 03:40:07.200]  know intentionally put their ruka in under risk but then in the next five minutes take you know
[03:40:07.200 --> 03:40:13.520]  all the key players of the all of all of chess is the gambit yeah and and this is this is huge
[03:40:13.520 --> 03:40:19.440]  because he has yeah sure he takes some hits but his base doesn't care because we're finally glad
[03:40:19.440 --> 03:40:24.160]  to have a street fighter a brawler you don't want to be in a bar fight with mitt romney the guy's
[03:40:24.160 --> 03:40:28.320]  going to be hiding under the table we're making a deal with the other side you know it one thing
[03:40:28.320 --> 03:40:33.200]  you know about trump is he's going to come out swinging and he's not at first to risk he likes it
[03:40:33.200 --> 03:40:37.360]  and then that's right what about this attitude i'm sure you've heard major universities uh
[03:40:37.360 --> 03:40:42.720]  colorado is saying take down the american flag don't say america and everyone just keeps groveling
[03:40:42.720 --> 03:40:48.320]  and groveling and groveling don't they get that that's the the creed of slaves this is the power
[03:40:48.320 --> 03:40:54.640]  of trump to not grovel i saw on daily mail pierce morgan's got a hysterical uh headline up you know
[03:40:54.640 --> 03:41:00.240]  about trump turning fascist because of the sender back thing well look at england we don't want to
[03:41:00.240 --> 03:41:05.360]  be england we don't want to be londonistan you know we don't want to be disarmed exactly so
[03:41:05.360 --> 03:41:12.080]  then sin city come back to pakistan he says that the england sucks so much yeah and and
[03:41:12.080 --> 03:41:17.920]  i what brent what a lot of people that don't vote don't vote because they think there hasn't been a
[03:41:17.920 --> 03:41:25.040]  an american politician that really had their back so i think that trump is bringing out the base
[03:41:25.040 --> 03:41:30.000]  and he's going to bring out even more plus all of these blue dog democrats that have you know
[03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:35.520]  their their paychecks are bigger and they're standing up for the flag when when they see the
[03:41:35.520 --> 03:41:41.440]  mexican flag and the amer- upside down american flag at that aurora colorado this burns a lot of
[03:41:41.440 --> 03:41:47.120]  people and yeah the the mainstream media likes to pretend everybody's outraged about sender back
[03:41:47.120 --> 03:41:51.280]  but i think for everybody that's outraged many more people are saying no i agree trump doesn't
[03:41:51.280 --> 03:41:56.480]  need that the tail to wag the dog with pierce morgan you know telling him oh my god your fascist
[03:41:56.480 --> 03:42:00.720]  send her back all right you're taking over i appreciate you i appreciate everybody the war

[03:42:57.520 --> 03:43:01.600]  and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or
[03:43:01.600 --> 03:43:05.760]  legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts
[03:43:05.760 --> 03:43:09.520]  the judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the
[03:43:09.520 --> 03:43:13.280]  ordinary members of the public in the audience that care about this has to bring real social
[03:43:13.280 --> 03:43:17.600]  political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and
[03:43:17.600 --> 03:43:21.440]  they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[03:43:21.440 --> 03:43:25.760]  who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to
[03:43:25.760 --> 03:43:30.560]  recover after the great depression the info war's audience is the fuel that flames the the light
[03:43:30.560 --> 03:43:35.680]  of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real
[03:43:35.680 --> 03:43:40.000]  the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media
[03:43:40.000 --> 03:43:44.400]  manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's
[03:43:44.400 --> 03:43:48.080]  thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate
[03:43:48.080 --> 03:43:52.960]  form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw

[03:47:32.960 --> 03:47:39.440]  Michael Hansen who's an american of danish descent actually he was born in danmark
[03:47:40.640 --> 03:47:47.120]  he went back to europe and made a film called killing europe a feature length film it's very
[03:47:47.120 --> 03:47:53.680]  hard to get seen though in an era of big tech censorship he made an he's got a new film out
[03:47:53.680 --> 03:48:01.200]  called killing free speech uh set in america and uh he's he's uh rolling it out it's part one is
[03:48:01.200 --> 03:48:08.160]  available now um he was on bright part a few days ago a feature article about it and now amazon has
[03:48:08.160 --> 03:48:14.160]  pulled his film killing europe so you can be all about antifa you can all be all about jihad
[03:48:14.160 --> 03:48:21.040]  but if you talk about exposing antifa or jihad suddenly you're a bad guy a bad comrade and you're
[03:48:21.040 --> 03:48:27.920]  censored so um we're gonna start with uh showing the trailer for uh killing free speech now and
[03:48:27.920 --> 03:48:34.480]  then michael hansen will join me after the trailer don't get too close you don't get too close

[03:48:41.920 --> 03:48:45.040]  isn't this a free country isn't this a free country it's not
[03:48:45.040 --> 03:48:56.800]  apparently free speech at ratchett assembly is not uh quite uh counting here
[03:49:01.040 --> 03:49:07.360]  america stands as kind of a last bastion for free speech and this means defense of speech
[03:49:08.400 --> 03:49:09.120]  all speech
[03:49:09.120 --> 03:49:21.040]  it's not really getting anywhere is it my name is antifa my name is antifa okay my name is free
[03:49:21.040 --> 03:49:28.880]  speech nice to meet you who won the cold war we're supposed to have won an united states
[03:49:28.880 --> 03:49:34.800]  in the west we're supposed to have won an ideological cold war what's the deal oh that's why
[03:49:34.800 --> 03:49:39.200]  you don't be waiting for your speech you know the the era of the bill clinton the old bill clinton
[03:49:39.200 --> 03:49:48.240]  democratic party is is over uh giving that kind of elevation to the street thugs of antifa is
[03:49:49.520 --> 03:49:53.280]  well it it tells you a lot about where the democratic party is these days
[03:49:58.640 --> 03:50:03.040]  oh so who's the nazi everybody who support thom everybody who support trump
[03:50:03.040 --> 03:50:11.520]  i wore a trump hat in a bar and was attacked viciously and this is okay especially in these
[03:50:11.520 --> 03:50:18.640]  liberal cities you're awake by the way you're not having a terrible terrible dream also you're
[03:50:18.640 --> 03:50:23.040]  not dead and you haven't gone to hell this is your life now this is us this is our country
[03:50:23.040 --> 03:50:33.520]  why are you doing this i don't get it i'm just trying to ask a question
[03:50:36.320 --> 03:50:44.480]  wow so michael hanson um this week i hear that uh ironically your film on killing free speech
[03:50:44.480 --> 03:50:50.240]  while it's being suppressed killing europe is we're taking off of amazon now your band
[03:50:50.240 --> 03:50:56.080]  from showings in public libraries and other places um how can we even fight this battle when
[03:50:56.720 --> 03:51:04.960]  you know the warriors of the battle are are hidden from view well i think uh a lot of people
[03:51:04.960 --> 03:51:09.760]  are asking me about similarities between the u.s and europe and what have you not and this is one
[03:51:09.760 --> 03:51:16.320]  of the reasons why i'm making these films is because when it comes to freedom or lack of i think that
[03:51:16.320 --> 03:51:23.920]  america is about 10 15 years behind europe when it comes to what's going on in europe and uh i
[03:51:23.920 --> 03:51:28.400]  think i mean if people aren't aware of what's going on in europe which i don't think so they
[03:51:28.400 --> 03:51:34.400]  can always watch killing freeze killing europe but um i mean there's two things going on in europe
[03:51:34.400 --> 03:51:42.240]  obviously you know the the impact of this mass migration and then the e you and the national
[03:51:42.240 --> 03:51:49.040]  governments uh efforts to suppress any information going on about what's going on there and obviously
[03:51:49.040 --> 03:51:53.760]  in order to enable all this you got to suppress free speech because if people don't know what's
[03:51:53.760 --> 03:51:59.200]  going on they're not going to oppose it and this is why i think and this is why i made killing
[03:51:59.200 --> 03:52:04.560]  free speech uh for the american audience because i think that your your number one protection here
[03:52:04.560 --> 03:52:10.240]  is your first amendment the right to talk about what's going on and i think that's one of the first
[03:52:10.240 --> 03:52:15.280]  things they want to take away is your right to talk about it because if you can't talk about it you
[03:52:15.280 --> 03:52:22.240]  can't protest it yeah i i've seen um the entire feature length killing europe i think it was on
[03:52:22.240 --> 03:52:29.120]  vimeo um but if people can't see it i mean if a tree falls in the in the forest but uh you know
[03:52:29.120 --> 03:52:34.560]  nobody's around who hears it um i think your your work is there is essential it's it's extremely
[03:52:34.560 --> 03:52:41.040]  highly produced i did i did notice um when when killing europe came out that one american news
[03:52:41.040 --> 03:52:46.800]  network played the entire thing so i give kudos to them you know for having the guts to take this on
[03:52:47.680 --> 03:52:53.120]  one of one american news reporters jack busovic he's uh got a pretty big twitter following
[03:52:53.120 --> 03:52:59.040]  he's really been going after antifa pretty strong um as you have uh he does it you know
[03:52:59.040 --> 03:53:06.000]  basically with uh twitter followers um and you're doing it with film but where can people find your
[03:53:06.000 --> 03:53:13.520]  films i mean if you know you're kind of buried like my books are yeah they can go on uh www
[03:53:13.520 --> 03:53:19.760]  killingfreespeech.com and then there you'll find all my videos or my films everything and all
[03:53:19.760 --> 03:53:26.400]  information um i mean it'll be there until somebody decides that that should be taken off there too
[03:53:26.400 --> 03:53:31.440]  i mean i'm not really batting too well on on getting my stuff off there because it seems like
[03:53:32.080 --> 03:53:38.880]  a lot of people just make it disappear especially now yeah when you it's iran it's funny or not
[03:53:38.880 --> 03:53:47.120]  funny it's it's terrible you get on bright part and um enough of these uh these these communist
[03:53:47.120 --> 03:53:53.280]  fascist goons see your work and say oh we don't want anybody else to know about them so somehow
[03:53:53.280 --> 03:53:59.360]  all of these mainstream uh big tech organizations they're all interlocked you know if you if you
[03:53:59.360 --> 03:54:04.240]  go to comment somewhere and you're not on facebook you can't comment um you know all of these things
[03:54:04.240 --> 03:54:09.360]  are linked so they they ban you from one place you can make the film you just can't show it or
[03:54:09.360 --> 03:54:13.600]  they won't let people find it um i find kind of the same thing with my novels
[03:54:14.800 --> 03:54:21.760]  exactly but what else the thing what's going on here is is that um you know i grew up in Denmark
[03:54:21.760 --> 03:54:27.920]  uh and i've seen what's going on in europe i've seen it first hand i was in europe when you had
[03:54:27.920 --> 03:54:34.880]  the migration wave come in and i actually posed as a refugee uh and i applied for asylum in Denmark
[03:54:34.880 --> 03:54:42.080]  a couple of places um that i mean and i and i roll with antifa also and also when i was actually
[03:54:42.080 --> 03:54:46.560]  young i experienced ants if i first hand when i was playing the punk band i kind of got sucked
[03:54:46.560 --> 03:54:53.520]  into that environment so i know what antifa is i know it first hand and and uh and and i'm also
[03:54:53.520 --> 03:54:58.320]  been on the receiving end now from antifa you know i got assaulted in europe and and they
[03:54:58.320 --> 03:55:04.560]  tried to jump in canada so you know i i'm very familiar with their methods and and i think one
[03:55:04.560 --> 03:55:09.120]  of the main purposes of killing free speech is when it comes to antifa is i really want to warn
[03:55:09.120 --> 03:55:15.600]  america to you know to stop this phenomenon call antifa before it gets out of hand because if you
[03:55:15.600 --> 03:55:22.000]  don't you're gonna have to the the situation having europe um and that's something we that i you know
[03:55:22.000 --> 03:55:28.080]  we could talk about i mean the comparison between u.s and europe when it comes to antifa yeah i see
[03:55:28.080 --> 03:55:34.240]  antifa as the as the street thug end of the spectrum um control the street and you can control
[03:55:34.240 --> 03:55:41.920]  the city control the country um where you have antifa uh socialist leaning politicians uh so
[03:55:41.920 --> 03:55:48.240]  the the police departments that they control via stand-down orders uh the the main the main media
[03:55:48.240 --> 03:55:56.480]  outlets they all work together and films like films like killing killing europe which is just
[03:55:56.480 --> 03:56:02.240]  it's heart-wrenching it's tragic hearing from girls who were who were you know gang raped and
[03:56:02.240 --> 03:56:09.040]  trafficked and these quizzlings these traders in britain and europe and in america what is their
[03:56:09.040 --> 03:56:15.520]  reaction to a film like like killing europe which should be shown on national television
[03:56:16.160 --> 03:56:23.040]  is not to to protect the girls and to warn about the danger of of uh what's coming which is anarcho
[03:56:23.040 --> 03:56:29.040]  communism and islamism instead it's to shut down the shut down the people that are trying to warn
[03:56:29.040 --> 03:56:37.040]  us people like you well you know one of the things i want to point out is is that what you got going
[03:56:37.040 --> 03:56:43.040]  on in united states is is that since the 2016 election antifa has really taken off because
[03:56:43.040 --> 03:56:49.520]  before 2016 i i always laughed at antifa in united states they were just college little college kids
[03:56:49.520 --> 03:56:54.480]  right um because i knew what antifa is in europe because i've seen it firsthand and i know a lot
[03:56:54.480 --> 03:57:00.560]  of people have experienced it you know in europe they're serious uh in europe they're supported by
[03:57:00.560 --> 03:57:06.080]  the local governments uh indirectly through you know they get funded through these so-called
[03:57:06.080 --> 03:57:12.000]  community houses and so forth yeah i'm sorry i'm michael we've only got 30 seconds left but
[03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:17.600]  it's it's horrible in in europe you actually see police leading islamists or antifa to a
[03:57:17.600 --> 03:57:23.360]  demonstration to break up the conservative rally so they're they're like the like hitler's brown
[03:57:23.360 --> 03:57:29.520]  shirts in that sense um unfortunately um you know we're out of time but i encourage people to
[03:57:29.520 --> 03:57:36.720]  look for michael hansons films killing free speech and killing europe and i'll see you when i see you
[03:57:42.880 --> 03:57:49.840]  as we gather this evening in the joy of freedom we remember that all share a truly extraordinary
[03:57:49.840 --> 03:57:56.480]  heritage together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told the story of america
[03:57:56.480 --> 03:58:03.680]  it is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right
[03:58:04.240 --> 03:58:11.920]  and what they know is true as long as we stay true to our folks as long as we remember our great
[03:58:11.920 --> 03:58:19.680]  history as long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future then there will be nothing
[03:58:19.680 --> 03:58:30.480]  that america cannot do
[03:58:33.200 --> 03:58:38.480]  in full wars dot com tomorrow's news today full power the republic in the name of jesus christ
[03:58:38.480 --> 03:58:45.760]  full power damn the torpedoes go straight at him let's talk to marcus in new york marcus you're
[03:58:45.760 --> 03:58:50.320]  on the air thanks for holding yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked
[03:58:50.320 --> 03:58:54.880]  to a lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody
[03:58:54.880 --> 03:58:59.760]  agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war
[03:58:59.760 --> 03:59:04.400]  because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the
[03:59:04.400 --> 03:59:08.880]  approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[03:59:08.880 --> 03:59:12.480]  the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's the time to be praying
[03:59:12.480 --> 03:59:16.320]  my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to
[03:59:16.320 --> 03:59:21.360]  shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're

[03:59:25.760 --> 03:59:31.440]  no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself
