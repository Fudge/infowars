[02:45.600 --> 02:52.560]  behind the highway that's been shut down due to the ridiculous bomb scare and
[02:52.560 --> 02:57.560]  there's a no doubt in my mind that that insiders have done this bomb scare the
[02:57.560 --> 03:00.560]  globalist and been caught doing this over and over again at different events to
[03:00.560 --> 03:03.960]  be able to lock things down British intelligence constantly gets caught
[03:03.960 --> 03:07.400]  around the world throwing firecrackers basically cherry bombs at their
[03:07.400 --> 03:12.040]  embassies and it comes out later they do it as a pretext to increase security
[03:12.040 --> 03:15.960]  this is a standard procedure it could have been a real bomb threat by some
[03:15.960 --> 03:21.120]  idiot as well but my gut tells me it's an inside operation so that they can push
[03:21.120 --> 03:26.280]  the perimeter back even more knowing that the usual suspects the young
[03:26.280 --> 03:29.720]  socialists are going to be there protesting them tomorrow but liberty

[11:20.680 --> 11:26.560]  threat about two hours ago it shut down the main highway that leads up to the
[11:26.560 --> 11:32.880]  mountain retreat they have built these big barrier walls basically tunnels for
[11:32.880 --> 11:36.160]  hundreds and hundreds of yards so the cars can stay at a high speed the
[11:36.160 --> 11:41.640]  limousines bringing in the head of NATO Bill Gates others Richard Pearl have
[11:41.640 --> 11:45.920]  been photographed by Aaron Dykes and Paul Watson in the high-res cameras they
[11:45.920 --> 11:49.520]  had to get back to the hotel to now start uploading those they're also
[11:49.520 --> 11:55.880]  identifying more globalist as they arrive more are coming in now they're
[11:55.880 --> 11:59.840]  gonna go down and talk to Jim Tucker in the hotel hearing about 25 minutes we'll

[12:03.560 --> 12:08.440]  globalists are still arriving some will also arrive tomorrow but they declared a
[12:08.440 --> 12:14.680]  bomb scare and shut down the road and blocking the reporters cars and
[12:14.680 --> 12:19.760]  demonstrators cars that were parked on the side of the road and Aaron just now
[12:19.760 --> 12:23.480]  got the car back and their hotels only about five minutes down the mountain
[12:23.480 --> 12:29.200]  they are now there so huge breaking news as we don't just protest Obama or
[12:29.200 --> 12:34.000]  Nicholas Sarkozy we actually go and face down the people who we know are
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.840]  trying to overthrow Liberty worldwide and install a global corporate
[12:37.840 --> 12:41.320]  technocracy that controls the populations through the government and
[12:41.320 --> 12:46.120]  they're selectively enforced carbon taxes and socialist health care and so
[12:46.120 --> 12:51.160]  now we go to Paul Joseph Watson Aaron Dykes waiting in the rings a wings Paul
[12:51.160 --> 12:56.560]  great job again top links on drudge driving in talk radio everywhere is
[12:56.560 --> 13:00.280]  talking about the Bilderberg group something that we know from our moles
[13:00.280 --> 13:04.560]  they are horrified of this is a great victory for Liberty we are actually
[13:04.560 --> 13:09.480]  identifying the puppeteers and not the puppets I salute all of you that are
[13:09.480 --> 13:14.200]  there on the ground I salute Matt drudge I salute the free press this is
[13:14.200 --> 13:17.560]  incredible they're also meeting in there trying to go after free speech on the
[13:17.560 --> 13:22.000]  internet that's in the report these are tyrants and you are there at the
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.440]  dragon's cave opening again I just have to salute all of you that are there
[13:27.440 --> 13:31.960]  Jim Tucker American free press net everyone Watson give us a report of
[13:31.960 --> 13:39.000]  what happened today well it's good to be back yeah basically we got there in the
[13:39.000 --> 13:43.040]  morning there were other journalists that went to the local airport here in
[13:43.040 --> 13:48.320]  Samarit try and catch these Bilderberg as they were exiting their private jets
[13:48.320 --> 13:53.120]  and the most interesting report to arise out of that is that there was
[13:53.120 --> 13:58.720]  apparently some kind of medical emergency on one of the planes carrying
[13:58.720 --> 14:03.480]  the Bilderberg members now obviously this is not confirmed but this is what we
[14:03.480 --> 14:06.640]  are changing Birmingham film then we're actually going to get a copy of that
[14:06.640 --> 14:11.200]  film and post it on the websites as soon as possible there was a medical
[14:11.200 --> 14:15.520]  emergency on one of the plane and one of the Bilderberg members was actually
[14:15.520 --> 14:21.000]  taken off the plane and they actually rolled out a red carpet he reported
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.200]  before this individual was taken off the plane and there were I'm there was an
[14:25.200 --> 14:28.920]  ambulance with blacked out tinted windows that took him away from the
[14:28.920 --> 14:33.000]  scene let me stop you let's be clear because Kurt's gonna write a blurb
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.440]  about this this is this is newsworthy we are changed Birmingham would that be out
[14:37.440 --> 14:42.880]  of England was in of course where they're landing two hours away because
[14:42.880 --> 14:46.720]  the airport is closed there in the offseason at St. Merritt's they're
[14:46.720 --> 14:51.480]  flying into what Swiss city did this happen in and again we are changed
[14:51.480 --> 14:57.080]  directly from where videotaped what it was that it was a local airport in
[14:57.080 --> 15:04.360]  St. Merritt's because the problem with it is the cloud cover is so low that
[15:04.360 --> 15:08.640]  they were having difficulty getting permission to land the flight in the
[15:08.640 --> 15:13.400]  morning so throughout the whole morning and the most of the afternoon we had
[15:13.400 --> 15:19.240]  basically not much more than a handful of Bilderberg attendees actually arrive
[15:19.240 --> 15:23.320]  and from what so that's why the story is changing you had been told the airport
[15:23.320 --> 15:26.480]  was closed you went there nothing was happening now you learn it was the
[15:26.480 --> 15:33.360]  cloud cover that's why a lot of them were diverted to the Zurich Zurich two
[15:33.360 --> 15:38.520]  hours away okay continue so so we are changed was taking out the airport they
[15:38.520 --> 15:42.160]  didn't buy that it was closed and they caught a red carpet taking one of these
[15:42.160 --> 15:47.680]  globalist off in a stretcher I don't know about a stretcher but I said it was a
[15:47.680 --> 15:51.840]  medical emergency that somebody was ill and so they had an ambulance pull up
[15:51.840 --> 15:57.400]  with tinted windows rolled out a red carpet and I mean he said he's got it
[15:57.400 --> 16:01.480]  on film and he's gonna give us the film so and then this this individual was
[16:01.480 --> 16:05.920]  taken away and then for the next few hours there was barely a trickle
[16:05.920 --> 16:12.360]  Bilderberg attendees arriving we we took photographs which were not what we
[16:12.360 --> 16:15.880]  represent sure because they're blurred and we need to blow them up and analyze
[16:15.880 --> 16:21.120]  them on the computer but one of the very first attendees that arrived both
[16:21.120 --> 16:25.840]  myself and Aaron as soon as we saw him immediately thought it looked like
[16:25.840 --> 16:29.960]  Richard Pearl because he you know he had kind of Nosferatu face with the
[16:29.960 --> 16:35.440]  balding head and Aaron was stood at the opposite end of the press area because
[16:35.440 --> 16:40.640]  the police had helpfully drawn a a line of free speech zone in which we could
[16:40.640 --> 16:45.560]  stand and as soon as I went up to Aaron he he said his first thing instinct was
[16:45.560 --> 16:49.320]  that it was Richard Pearl sure just like in 2006 I knew it was woeful it's me
[16:49.320 --> 16:53.800]  later confirmed it the human eye is still a lot better than a camera as they
[16:53.800 --> 17:00.040]  built that several hundred yard long tunnel for them to go in with walls on
[17:00.040 --> 17:05.000]  both sides so they can speed up you're there firing photos office fast as you
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.840]  can also we're told that Bill Gates and the head of NATO have also been
[17:10.840 --> 17:16.720]  photographed yeah the second attendee that we were able to get a photograph of
[17:16.720 --> 17:22.000]  which Aaron did but the photo is quite blurred but to me it looks like Bill
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.480]  Gates I may be incorrect we've got to analyze it but that was my actual
[17:26.480 --> 17:31.600]  instinct and then we we got quite a good photograph of a third attendee arriving
[17:31.600 --> 17:37.000]  and we asked the we are changed Switzerland and the assorted into the
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.760]  journalists who they thought it was and they said it was the NATO Secretary
[17:41.760 --> 17:46.060]  General who is Rasmussen is that correct yeah and of course they're running the
[17:46.060 --> 17:49.720]  big bombardment right now in Libya now secret air strikes New York Times
[17:49.720 --> 17:54.760]  reports in Yemen I mean these that's a fifth war now Paul specifically
[17:54.760 --> 17:58.560]  obviously you guys after you're done getting Tucker on need to get back out
[17:58.560 --> 18:03.520]  of that airport a lot of times they do come in later in the evening is it it's
[18:03.520 --> 18:08.280]  not dark there yet and and and the mother load is about to get there that
[18:08.280 --> 18:12.560]  to drive two and a half hours from Zurich as you guys did when you got in
[18:12.560 --> 18:16.480]  on Wednesday but expanding I know Aaron was the guy that actually talked to the
[18:16.480 --> 18:20.000]  police we'll come back to him after the break but dealing with the bomb scare
[18:20.000 --> 18:26.160]  what's your take on that what what did you see well Aaron's the best to explain
[18:26.160 --> 18:30.240]  that because he actually we were at the bottom of the hill our car was parked at
[18:30.240 --> 18:35.920]  the top of the hill right at the hotel literally about 50 yards from the hotel
[18:35.920 --> 18:40.440]  in the in the parking area and we had we had physically moved our equipment
[18:40.440 --> 18:45.560]  down the hill because the Bilderberg cars were arriving and they had a sharp
[18:45.560 --> 18:50.920]  left turn so with all the cars had slowed down to a crawling speed we should
[18:50.920 --> 18:54.720]  enable us to get better photographs and have more chance of capturing their
[18:54.720 --> 18:59.000]  faces so we were at the bottom of the hill the car was left at the top of the
[18:59.000 --> 19:03.160]  hill when Aaron went back up the hill to retrieve the car that was when this
[19:03.160 --> 19:07.800]  whole bomb threat thing began and I'll put you on to Aaron so he can explain
[19:07.800 --> 19:11.000]  in detail absolutely in foot in fact we're showing video right now for
[19:11.000 --> 19:15.720]  prisonplanet.tv viewers we're gonna get this added to the drudge link to bomb
[19:15.720 --> 19:19.960]  scare report where as the Bilderberg groups you guys found a weak spot where
[19:19.960 --> 19:22.920]  they had to turn around slowly and we're getting video suddenly they then
[19:22.920 --> 19:26.760]  announced the bomb scare we're gonna go to break here and come back with Aaron
[19:26.760 --> 19:31.520]  Dykes on this breaking news so soon as that happened then they shut down the
[19:31.520 --> 19:35.080]  whole main road to push our people back even further so that we couldn't get
[19:35.080 --> 19:39.000]  video of the globalist arriving again why do they want to hide this well
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.760]  Hillary Clinton had to pay a 300 plus thousand dollar fine in the mid 90s
[19:43.760 --> 19:47.920]  we're going to Bilderberg and getting caught that's why now when she goes they
[19:47.920 --> 19:52.040]  keep it totally secret and she's in Europe right now by the way and no one
[19:52.040 --> 19:56.520]  quote knows where she is with her special helper Mrs. Wiener you can't make

[24:39.280 --> 24:42.480]  Dyches and Paul Watson with us Aaron tell us about the bombscare them we're
[24:42.480 --> 24:46.480]  getting Tucker on and we're also gonna try to get Mark Anderson on tomorrow for
[24:46.480 --> 24:52.120]  American Free Press who's there as well very articulate and informed and you
[24:52.120 --> 24:56.200]  guys in the last 30 minutes today I'll report back from the steps of the
[24:56.200 --> 25:01.280]  lockdown hotel with the paramilitary police out there Aaron describe what
[25:01.280 --> 25:04.880]  happened when you guys found a spot where their cars had to slow down and
[25:04.880 --> 25:08.840]  you were getting Bill Gates and the head of NATO and others something happened
[25:08.840 --> 25:13.120]  tell us what happened well the protesters and us have been standing out
[25:13.120 --> 25:17.960]  there all day and the police have been gradually pushing us back they built an
[25:17.960 --> 25:22.600]  additional veil further respecting the view of the hotel and the arriving
[25:22.600 --> 25:27.480]  attendees then after a few hours today the police suddenly cordoned off the
[25:27.480 --> 25:32.960]  road itself walking off a public parking lot where our car was parked and
[25:32.960 --> 25:37.320]  other people we spoke with I spoke directly to the chief of police or the
[25:37.320 --> 25:42.200]  main police officer running that and he said tough luck you can't get your car
[25:42.200 --> 25:47.720]  he said there's been a bomb scare then we found that two people have allegedly
[25:47.720 --> 25:52.440]  or reportedly been arrested whether or not they were connected with this so
[25:52.440 --> 25:57.120]  called scare we don't know but that was the implication there was even a claim
[25:57.120 --> 26:02.600]  that they found something they did that in 2008 in Virginia they had the guy
[26:02.600 --> 26:06.680]  that obviously worked for them they later released him claiming he had a gun and
[26:06.680 --> 26:11.600]  remember that guy was there only video taping us that's right so Bilderberger
[26:11.600 --> 26:17.960]  quite ready to pull a false flag to beat back the protesters and clamp down the
[26:17.960 --> 26:21.440]  public eye because they know people are watching what they're doing and they
[26:21.440 --> 26:24.880]  want to restrict that as much as possible and to be clear the police told
[26:24.880 --> 26:29.080]  you there been a bomb threat they did say there been a bomb threat they said
[26:29.080 --> 26:33.840]  no one could get through neither cars nor persons I was first told it'll only
[26:33.840 --> 26:39.000]  be 15 or 20 minutes then that extended to one to two hours all things told
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.120]  ended up being an hour and 15 minutes or so until they opened back up the roads
[26:44.120 --> 26:49.040]  to the bomb scare then of course police were roping off the area closing off
[26:49.040 --> 26:53.760]  other entrances and while a lot of the members came through the main road where
[26:53.760 --> 26:58.680]  everyone were they were also using a block off one-way entrance for kind of a
[26:58.680 --> 27:02.440]  back door into the hotel as well so we're doing what we can to cover all
[27:02.440 --> 27:10.640]  angles well incredible job Aaron how many media people and protesters are there
[27:10.640 --> 27:18.280]  a ballpark a few dozen maybe 30 or so I did see at least one media person
[27:18.280 --> 27:23.920]  hopefully others will be showing up we'll find out all right great job Aaron and
[27:23.920 --> 27:29.600]  I know that I'm gonna let you travel down into the smoking lounge where Jim
[27:29.600 --> 27:34.720]  Tucker of 35 years covering Bilderberg in the wilderness he is down there and I
[27:34.720 --> 27:38.080]  know Jim at least in the videos I've seen appears to be a little under the
[27:38.080 --> 27:41.440]  weather but we'll try to get as much information as we can out of him and if
[27:41.440 --> 27:51.320]  you then also see Mr. Anderson there Mark Anderson also with the same paper
[27:51.320 --> 27:56.040]  then perhaps we'll talk to Tucker for five ten minutes and then handed off to
[27:56.040 --> 28:00.080]  him if not get back in the car get back over to Bilderberg maybe dropped by the
[28:00.080 --> 28:04.520]  airport first the scums probably landing more of them right now of course
[28:04.520 --> 28:07.560]  had their minions running around telling us oh the airport's closed nobody's
[28:07.560 --> 28:12.440]  there that was a bait and switch it's so routine get over there get the video of
[28:12.440 --> 28:16.680]  that because they're desperate that we not see them going to this event because
[28:16.680 --> 28:20.720]  they are in there colluding and running agendas and briefly Aaron you've done
[28:20.720 --> 28:24.360]  research on that I mean even the BBC admits they are setting a lot of big
[28:24.360 --> 28:30.040]  agendas there yes they certainly are Alex I mean it's a military industrial
[28:30.040 --> 28:35.600]  complex combined with the worst bankers you can imagine lots of the head to the
[28:35.600 --> 28:40.240]  banks that we've bailed out as we later found out that the Federal Reserve gave
[28:40.240 --> 28:45.840]  money to foreign banks in Europe I forget the list but it's on record those are
[28:45.840 --> 28:50.240]  largely the Bilderberg members so they've created this crisis that they've set
[28:50.240 --> 28:55.120]  themselves up to gain through it gain from it rather and we're seeing that on
[28:55.120 --> 29:00.160]  full now Alex well these are the people on record and we told people this 2006
[29:00.160 --> 29:04.000]  seven and eight that would implode the world markets through derivatives bring
[29:04.000 --> 29:07.560]  in austerity everything we said has happened because we have the sources
[29:07.560 --> 29:12.080]  via Tucker Esteline has had some sources we have some other sources we don't talk
[29:12.080 --> 29:18.240]  about but also what we see Bilderberg attendees openly pushing at Davos the
[29:18.240 --> 29:22.920]  trilateral Commission reports they put out we know this is the top of the
[29:22.920 --> 29:27.440]  pyramid royalty Rothschild's Rockefellers you name it we'll let you get down to the
[29:27.440 --> 29:32.160]  lounge and get Tucker on the phone and Anderson after that of you can great
[29:32.160 --> 29:38.240]  job Aaron Dykes back with us in two hours to break down the latest
[29:38.240 --> 29:41.480]  developments from Bilderberg more on the big protest Wednesday coming up and a

[33:20.640 --> 33:25.960]  the gear today few weeks ago I stormed the Texas Capitol with great liberty
[33:25.960 --> 33:31.040]  lovers to demand that they not kill the bill that was unanimously passed by the
[33:31.040 --> 33:35.760]  House to stop the illegal federal 10th Amendment violating 4th Amendment
[33:35.760 --> 33:41.120]  violating as well molestation that's going on and Rick Perry is still not put
[33:41.120 --> 33:46.160]  that back on the special session agenda of the Texas legislature even though he
[33:46.160 --> 33:50.160]  promised that he supported the bill of course he's a Bilderberg group attendee
[33:50.160 --> 33:55.320]  and minion and what do you expect he says one thing and does another just like
[33:55.320 --> 33:59.600]  all these other globalists do oh we'd only be in Libya days not weeks here we
[33:59.600 --> 34:04.480]  are three plus months later well breaking secret Bilderberg agenda leaked by
[34:04.480 --> 34:08.560]  mole via Jim Tucker it's all up at American Free Press in full wars.com
[34:08.560 --> 34:12.960]  and the drudge report is linked to it as well I'm calling for Europeans to
[34:12.960 --> 34:16.680]  march on the Bilderberg tyrants with a peaceful protest Saturday at high noon
[34:16.680 --> 34:21.920]  this is so important to identify the real scallywags very exciting 35 plus
[34:21.920 --> 34:28.600]  years exposing these people Jim Tucker joins us from the media lounge at the
[34:28.600 --> 34:32.360]  hotel just about five minutes away or less from Bilderberg in fact you can
[34:32.360 --> 34:37.040]  see the Bilderberg compound from where Tucker is Jim thank you for joining us
[34:37.040 --> 34:42.520]  sir it's always fun well Jim you got a lot of key intel out from your moles and
[34:42.520 --> 34:48.000]  sources what is the latest that you can give us
[34:48.000 --> 34:54.680]  well they're extremely determined to make the war on the invasion of Libya big
[34:54.680 --> 35:01.720]  bloody war in the Middle East which we love every country except Israel which
[35:01.720 --> 35:13.120]  is be protected they are we're saying today according to inside Bilderberg boy that they
[35:13.120 --> 35:18.080]  think the recession which they are determined to continue through the year
[35:18.080 --> 35:30.120]  2012 will will help in this situation that driving up the oil prices will make
[35:30.120 --> 35:35.360]  Americans more willing to accept that bloody war in the Middle East of the
[35:35.360 --> 35:44.160]  period is to fight the oil cartel which is not their part of the oil cartel and
[35:44.160 --> 35:50.560]  also you've been quite successful in getting the protesters out it's a
[35:50.560 --> 35:54.080]  tribute to all Americans and to the Europeans are here which is mostly
[35:54.080 --> 36:01.920]  European course what they got off their helicopters they were Bilderberg boys
[36:01.920 --> 36:05.000]  for a little bit late because they had all these rains that kept the hill
[36:05.000 --> 36:09.720]  coppers grounded from Paris where they're having their cover beating up of
[36:09.720 --> 36:18.560]  the NATO countries where they're of course calling they calling for war and
[36:18.560 --> 36:23.520]  enlarging the war and getting more countries involved in the war and but
[36:23.520 --> 36:27.760]  they were unable to get the helicopters through the heavy rainstorms they have
[36:27.760 --> 36:32.560]  here so they were late getting in to go off the helicopters they were stunned
[36:32.560 --> 36:37.440]  they shouldn't be spending should be used by now see large numbers of
[36:37.440 --> 36:43.360]  protesters that challenging their presence also you'll be reading about
[36:43.360 --> 36:53.360]  how a statement from the Swedish the Swiss government had denounced Bilderberg
[36:53.360 --> 36:59.440]  to have been raised with their sovereignty they should not be part of
[36:59.440 --> 37:05.120]  this bloody mess and the Prime Minister nice-looking ladies I've got her name
[37:05.120 --> 37:12.680]  off hand it's hard to pronounce anybody I said oh yes he's a she agrees we should
[37:12.680 --> 37:19.760]  not be involved we should not surrender our sovereignty but nevertheless she did
[37:19.760 --> 37:25.920]  attend the opening meeting of Bilderberg and heard about how wonderful they are
[37:25.920 --> 37:32.160]  so about two-faced monarch was that at the front meeting they had in Paris as
[37:32.160 --> 37:36.800]  they normally do to then shuttle in and and and what is this in the Swiss
[37:36.800 --> 37:43.480]  papers this is breaking news oh yes yes they had heavy stuff and various
[37:43.480 --> 37:48.240]  newspapers including Swiss fire newspapers I can't understand but I can
[37:48.240 --> 37:53.760]  recognize the name Bilderberg yeah Paul Paul Paul Watson's able to actually
[37:53.760 --> 37:57.000]  read it because he knows German it's very similar and and that's what he's
[37:57.000 --> 38:04.080]  telling us go ahead Jim yeah we have some people here who did translations for
[38:04.080 --> 38:09.640]  us it already pulled out a lot of names and David Rockefeller was positively
[38:09.640 --> 38:15.720]  identified 100% identified by the troops and he's got 96 years old but he'll
[38:15.720 --> 38:19.480]  attend Bilderberg the first time he doesn't attend the Bilderberg meeting will
[38:19.480 --> 38:25.280]  be when he's dead which is not so far in the future so we're accumulating an
[38:25.280 --> 38:29.480]  awful lot of names I believe Bilderberg needs very well surrender as they have
[38:29.480 --> 38:34.840]  in the past their official list of participants nevertheless we never stop
[38:34.840 --> 38:39.520]  identifying as many as possible for two reasons we may not get for this so we'll
[38:39.520 --> 38:44.960]  identify as many as we can with a hundred percent certainty and if we do get
[38:44.960 --> 38:49.440]  for this there's always names only possibly identified this they were not
[38:49.440 --> 38:55.080]  on their own just trying to cover up for some reason have you seen Daniel Estolin
[38:55.080 --> 39:01.400]  this year nope he's uh I was saying at all he used to be his leading Bilderberg
[39:01.400 --> 39:07.280]  fighter but he's sort of disappeared in recent years he's up recently last year
[39:07.280 --> 39:16.600]  he's unable to reach him by his either his cell phone or his internet is both
[39:16.600 --> 39:23.160]  okay just a side note wondering if he was there now continuing Jim your mole
[39:23.160 --> 39:28.800]  inside you of course broke yesterday that they want to expand the war in the
[39:28.800 --> 39:32.760]  Middle East they're worried about Congress standing up against Obama going
[39:32.760 --> 39:35.800]  along with the war without congressional approval they're worried about the
[39:35.800 --> 39:39.040]  alternative press they want to move to try to curtail the internet which we
[39:39.040 --> 39:43.240]  seek sarcosis in Europe openly pushing for in these new UN treaties they want
[39:43.240 --> 39:48.960]  their carbon tax their program is not doing well for them what else is on the
[39:48.960 --> 39:52.840]  agenda you talked about there they're desperate to prop up the euro because
[39:52.840 --> 39:58.320]  that's their receivership arm to gobble up substates any other intel on what's
[39:58.320 --> 40:08.360]  on the agenda not too much more to add except their continued depression which
[40:08.360 --> 40:16.240]  has been undergone for more than 15 years their continues obscene references
[40:16.240 --> 40:23.120]  to American and European patriots who protest their presence and to the
[40:23.120 --> 40:29.080]  heavy hand of even the major newspapers the the Guardian of London the Irish
[40:29.080 --> 40:36.880]  Times all had very heavy stories and they're especially intrigued by the fact
[40:36.880 --> 40:42.960]  that Tim Clark filled with a part with a D long-time member of the British
[40:42.960 --> 40:48.920]  Parliament a long-time Bilderberg luminary leader it's not coming this
[40:48.920 --> 40:53.680]  year the speculation is why the answer when it comes to being that he's done
[40:53.680 --> 41:01.400]  something bad because these international gags are very pretty
[41:01.400 --> 41:08.480]  torsores becomes the headline in criminal stories he's out he's building
[41:08.480 --> 41:13.940]  a good friend they said so but he's not out we were they asked Rupert Murdoch
[41:13.940 --> 41:20.160]  the owner biggest owner of newspapers throughout the world to try to talk the
[41:20.160 --> 41:27.320]  major newspapers in Europe out of covering Bilderberg they failed miserably
[41:27.320 --> 41:31.760]  Rupert Murdoch was they may have done a little help I don't know that major
[41:31.760 --> 41:37.080]  newspapers are hitting our well some major newspapers a lot of local
[41:37.080 --> 41:42.560]  independent newspapers and broadcasters are hitting it hard well Jim you know the
[41:42.560 --> 41:47.840]  king the number one news website in the world rudge report yeah is linked to our
[41:47.840 --> 41:51.800]  reports the video of our interview with you with our links to American Free
[41:51.800 --> 41:56.160]  Press so so it is it is being covered and it is outraging them I want to bring
[41:56.160 --> 42:02.800]  this up to you MSNBC has written a whitewash and then CNBC has written a
[42:02.800 --> 42:07.240]  whitewash saying oh Bilderberg's real but it has no power BBC's done the same
[42:07.240 --> 42:11.400]  thing show there the New York Times just three years ago said I was delusional
[42:11.400 --> 42:15.320]  that they didn't meet in Chantilly and then I was literally having hallucinations
[42:15.320 --> 42:18.520]  and imagining that they were there that's how dumb they think their readers are
[42:18.520 --> 42:23.240]  what do you think of this tactic Jim of course you were there with me what do you
[42:23.240 --> 42:27.400]  think of this and we're thrown out by police but it doesn't exist what do you
[42:27.400 --> 42:31.440]  think of this tactic that they're really pushing now from going and saying it
[42:31.440 --> 42:38.040]  doesn't exist to saying yes it exists but it doesn't have any power well that's
[42:38.040 --> 42:41.400]  why they won't they're friendly press to say when they're forced to cover
[42:41.400 --> 42:47.400]  something they're just a bunch of innocent merchants are just having a
[42:47.400 --> 42:54.720]  plightful meeting and all of these conspiracy theorists are have got it all
[42:54.720 --> 43:04.200]  wrong well as I've told you for many times I am not a conspiracy theorist I
[43:04.200 --> 43:09.240]  recognize conspiracy fact there's less webster fiction there is wrong it is a
[43:09.240 --> 43:13.440]  conspiracy whether you want to call it good or bad it's also as you know a
[43:13.440 --> 43:22.920]  violation of the Logan Act and and yet the yet they persist as you know the
[43:22.920 --> 43:31.560]  Logan Act has said that public officials federal officials cannot meet
[43:31.560 --> 43:36.640]  on closed doors with private citizens to make public policy they can meet with
[43:36.640 --> 43:44.040]  each other without inside from the outside certainly more tax and so forth
[43:44.040 --> 43:52.360]  there's still legal now apologies say well the Logan Act was passed in 1790 so
[43:52.360 --> 43:59.840]  but you got Hillary dinged for it yourself in the mid 90s yeah she attended
[43:59.840 --> 44:08.400]  the billaberg meeting as first lady and got in Georgia Lake Lanier and all the
[44:08.400 --> 44:14.760]  staffers there I'm not all that many of the staffers said they're very excited
[44:14.760 --> 44:20.600]  Hillary Clinton's here I said that's not possible oh personally you could not
[44:20.600 --> 44:26.080]  possibly be attending Bill Clinton attended is the office your governor of
[44:26.080 --> 44:30.320]  Arkansas and was elected because of the year later but no she was definitely
[44:30.320 --> 44:35.480]  there I was sure when I got back to Washington and as I told you before I
[44:35.480 --> 44:41.280]  called the five-hour first lady's press office and you buffaloed them and said
[44:41.280 --> 44:44.040]  I'm going with it and they had to admit it after they lied to you yeah we told
[44:44.040 --> 44:47.280]  that now Jim a few more minutes we appreciate your time and your
[44:47.280 --> 44:50.600]  incredible work perhaps you'll be able to pop back in with more tomorrow and
[44:50.600 --> 44:54.160]  then obviously next week when you get back you told us a few days ago
[44:54.160 --> 44:58.360]  billaberg is outraged by the coverage outraged by the patriot movement Jim
[44:58.360 --> 45:02.560]  do you have anything else on that just if there's more outrage and more
[45:02.560 --> 45:06.400]  outrageous if they're so louder and louder and you read the names of a lot
[45:06.400 --> 45:11.920]  of these turkish including some Americans who have
[45:11.920 --> 45:20.040]  expressed their heart and the great great anger that the commoners are forcing
[45:20.040 --> 45:24.480]  this coverage and forcing these have lies we'll have a lot more to say about it
[45:24.480 --> 45:29.760]  next week I'm looking forward to this usual all right Jim and again there's
[45:29.760 --> 45:33.520]  more tomorrow we want to try to get you to pop in but obviously next week what
[45:33.520 --> 45:38.080]  do you think of my idea to call on all Europeans instead of just protesting in
[45:38.080 --> 45:42.480]  their major capitals the bottom paid for politician puppets to actually go to
[45:42.480 --> 45:48.440]  St. Moritz Saturday at high noon from all over Switzerland all over Europe from
[45:48.440 --> 45:55.160]  France from Germany from Italy from Austria all just a few hours away and to
[45:55.160 --> 45:59.840]  go there and to have a massive demonstration instead of something
[45:59.840 --> 46:04.800]  spontaneous like Woodstock Liberty stock and this could really put another
[46:04.800 --> 46:08.800]  nail in Bilderberg this could have them be completely blown wide open
[46:08.800 --> 46:12.760]  politically and force this into an international story Jim what do you think
[46:12.760 --> 46:17.200]  of that idea will you join me in calling for all patriots to be part of
[46:17.200 --> 46:23.480]  history and to converge right now on St. Moritz Saturday high noon absolutely I
[46:23.480 --> 46:27.600]  will if you'll be glad to know that there's people over here calling
[46:27.600 --> 46:34.520]  calling for a picture out in Europe and the former East Bloc countries like
[46:34.520 --> 46:39.320]  Romania and so forth to come here and Poland to come here in post yes their
[46:39.320 --> 46:42.960]  calling part very loudly just in the newspapers over here too yes because
[46:42.960 --> 46:45.760]  they're being raped by them well it's Saturday high noon we need to have
[46:45.760 --> 46:48.880]  everybody there at once there's some other smaller protests tomorrow but
[46:48.880 --> 46:53.120]  everybody needs to be part of history getting their cars now and get to that

[54:52.000 --> 54:58.800]  decades they come in they get the politicians to have the country sign on
[54:58.800 --> 55:02.960]  to invest the pension funds in derivatives that are completely worthless
[55:02.960 --> 55:08.400]  total fraud paper and on the way up financially the banksters then make
[55:08.400 --> 55:12.960]  trillions then on the way down it endangers the entire economic system
[55:12.960 --> 55:18.400]  everybody's pension funds 401ks stock market portfolio everything and they
[55:18.400 --> 55:22.760]  say in Europe and the United States same in every country give us tens of
[55:22.760 --> 55:27.200]  trillions let us secretly give it to whoever we want not even Congress or
[55:27.200 --> 55:31.880]  parliament can be told and we will keep the economic order going and then
[55:31.880 --> 55:36.040]  Congress in 2008 said in October no we're not gonna do that and so they
[55:36.040 --> 55:39.920]  had all the heads of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve come out and say
[55:39.920 --> 55:43.440]  we're gonna have a total depression blood in the streets everything's gonna
[55:43.440 --> 55:47.360]  collapse and the stock market fell by almost a thousand points and Congress

[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.560]  Alex Jones
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:30.720]  think about how incredibly disgusting this is you have the Rothschilds the
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:34.240]  Rockefellers the Queen of the Netherlands representatives of the Queen of
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:40.120]  England all of these big oil company heads the heads of the top banks in the
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:43.560]  planet the people that have created the derivatives the people that have bought
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.880]  off our politicians worldwide two years ago they came in openly bought off the
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:51.840]  Greek government put their president in put their finance minister in you look
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:56.560]  at countries all over the world they got Goldman Sachs JP Morgan former people
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:02.520]  in the revolving door working inside the major governments as the finance
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.200]  ministers the presidents the prime ministers the leaders of the Senate's
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:12.120]  this is how they're getting away with the corruption this is how they get away
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:16.960]  with the rest of the world economy melting down global depression while
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.760]  these megabanks make trillions of dollars and individuals are paid billions
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:25.600]  and billions and billions in bonuses and as the water prices are increased so
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:29.320]  the government can quote pay off the debts they don't owe in Ireland and
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:34.360]  Greece in the United States as taxes are raised everywhere and as the services
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:38.000]  are cut the people are told they're cutting services for austerity to pay
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.280]  off the debt but if you look at Eastern Europe you look at Latin America you
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.600]  look at Western countries that have been taken over by these people you never
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:48.440]  get out of the debt because it's impossible it's 1.5 quadrillion it's
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:52.800]  fraudulent that would have been like telling Germans in the Great Depression
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:02:01.600]  in 1932 that they had to pay off every individual family's debt of trillions of
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:07.320]  marks you know it took billions of marks to buy a a loaf of bread USA today
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:15.120]  yesterday had the cover story that it's really 60 plus trillion dollars that the
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.120]  United States quote owes well I'm sorry last year the Washington Post reported
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:26.760]  the US share of derivatives is 600 trillion of the 1.5 quadrillion
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:33.240]  worldwide it's impossible to pay off we don't owe it it's a fraud we are
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:38.760]  incredibly wealthy but they've invested the police pension funds the fire funds
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:44.720]  the teacher funds the private funds everything in these systems and now
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:48.360]  they're holding this hostage saying give us whatever we want cut all your
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:53.640]  benefits or you'll get nothing that's the trick and then we do that three years
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:58.200]  ago things get worse now they're back saying more bailouts more money more
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:03.000]  unlimited trillions to Europe or Greece will collapse and take Europe with it
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.620]  it won't take Greece and Europe with it and then America it will take the
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:10.200]  bankers with it and you watch they're gonna have trillions more in quote
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.160]  bailouts that are really just blood money paid to these criminals and they'll
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.400]  be back in a couple more years for more more more and the deeper the
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:21.600]  depression gets they'll say cut cut cut cut cut cut cut pay us everything and
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:25.640]  we'll fix it then you cut cut cut cut cut cut cut pay them everything and it
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:31.000]  only gets worse I mean here's Obama and we told you a week ago this was gonna
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.960]  happen that at Bilderberg they were going to get trillions more and Obama is
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:40.600]  pressing the Germans and others to bail out the son of bailout to give
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:44.960]  trillions more including US taxpayer money and German and French and other
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.240]  money to quote save Greece or it'll pull down Europe the debt over 90% of it is
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:54.480]  created by the bankers they just get government to sign on to the debt and
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.920]  promise to bail it out then they turn around and say this is your debt you've
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.400]  got to pay it and we're gonna cut your pension fund we're gonna cut your social
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:08.120]  security that you paid into now I'm not a fan of people being dependent I'm not
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:11.840]  a fan of the socialist model because I know it was created by the bankers on
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:16.320]  record to get you dependent so they could then hold you hostage and control
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:20.760]  the entire system and have everything under federal systems that tie into the
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:25.040]  world government but here's Obama and we told you this was coming Obama presses
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:30.080]  Europe pledges help for Greek crisis they've already had three rounds of
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.840]  bailouts there Reese has lost its credit rating just like Moody's as
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:37.720]  standard and poor says the US's so it's more more more the more you pay the
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:41.920]  bankers the more you owe them because when our countries create a dollar to
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:45.960]  bail someone out a dollar of debt is created to the very bankers that we're
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:50.640]  bailing out it's like a snake eating its tail the fraud is so huge and so
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:55.400]  simple it makes it complex and people can't see it it's us or them it's us
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:59.240]  or them ladies and gentlemen we're coming back with more coverage stay with

[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:32.080]  minutes into our number two of this worldwide transmission I want to give
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:37.880]  the number out for Europeans people going under the debt austerity of the
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:42.240]  banksters who on record our own government admits engaged in crimes
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.680]  creating 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives and now we've got to quote bail them
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:50.600]  out and have them make record profits or they threaten to implode the rest of
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:56.160]  our economy because like Siamese twins they have woven all of our currency and
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:59.680]  our infrastructure and our investments into their system and they're holding us
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:04.600]  hostage the issue is though they want austerity they want to make us poor so
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.440]  we can be politically controlled Bilderberg has admitted that these
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:13.640]  globalists use poverty as a tool so if you give in to their hostage taking
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:18.600]  economically if you give into their economic terrorism they then just bring
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:23.720]  you step-by-step into deeper and deeper bondage so all we can do is say go ahead
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:27.800]  give us the depression slam everything down we're gonna arrest every single one
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:31.080]  of you believe me if our government started doing the right thing and
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:34.240]  indicting these people even Rolling Stone two weeks ago said the Senate
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:38.640]  Committee has found total crime by these big mega banks where are the indictments
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:44.960]  where are they arrest them all it's us or them they own both major parties in
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:50.200]  every major country it's us or them their crimes are legion their crimes are
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:55.360]  open and now Obama is saying oh Germany and others don't want to give trillions
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.480]  more but America is they don't want to give trillions more to the bankers it's
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:03.160]  not really a banker bailout it's giving it to them or they'll hold Europe hostage
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:09.360]  and suck us down with it and he's saying he's pressing Europe to pony up along
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:13.880]  with the US with more tax money that goes directly to these mega banks that
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:18.720]  engineered all this and his entire administration is Goldman Sachs JP Morgan
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:25.400]  the entire stinking thing I mean this is incredible and they own Romney of Romney
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:30.240]  care the model for Obama care a lot of Republicans don't care you know what as
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:34.240]  long as it's a white guy and as long you know what they don't care if he's
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:38.280]  anti-gun either they they kind of like it well I'm not one of you mainline
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:43.840]  Republican idiots that's all I have to say and a lot of Americans are waking
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:47.520]  up to what's going on and waking up to what's happening and figuring things out
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:51.800]  on the media trying to ignore Ron Paul well you can ignore Ron Paul all day
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:55.040]  he's getting the word out the people are listening and you're losing more and
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.200]  more credibility mainstream media you're not going to be mainstream very long
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:02.880]  you're becoming a joke and we've broken the electronic Berlin wall the news
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:08.880]  blackout on Bilderberg 2011 the top two reports on drudge report dot com right
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:14.840]  now bombscare shuts down road to Bilderberg meeting and they use that as
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:19.120]  a foil to basically shut things down so we couldn't get video their faces but
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:24.640]  not before we didn't got the head of NATO Bill Gates and others also secret
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:28.800]  agenda leaked by mole I want to go over some of that secret agenda later in the
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:33.240]  hour that's really our biggest news and of course we're calling for a giant
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:37.320]  protest people all over Europe have come out in the millions against tyranny
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:42.720]  in the austerity these are the people that did it with the 47% unemployment
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:46.400]  many European countries now and people under 30 the 20 plus percent
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:50.360]  unemployment the general public these are the people these are the people that
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.840]  raise your taxes with the average European pays over 70% in taxes these
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:12:00.240]  are the people that are openly have their banking heads the treasury heads the
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:05.200]  exchequer of England all of them former heads like Alan Greenspan all out
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:08.880]  saying we need to raise your taxes Warren Buffett who got hundreds of
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:14.280]  billions of your bailout money your money he says raised taxes on the rich
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:20.040]  meanwhile he's exempt from it fortune 500 pay on average 2.4% taxes they're
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:24.880]  globalist they're international they've exempted themselves from the law oh we
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:28.400]  need to help the poor remember the carbon tax two years ago in Copenhagen
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:31.440]  this in the treaty got leaked they wouldn't release the treaty but the
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:35.600]  third world countries leaked the treaty and the Danes released the treaty and
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:40.920]  it had right at right at not exactly double but right at one point away from
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:46.080]  double the carbon taxes on the third world that the West had to have see
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:50.280]  they sold the third world hey Africans hey Latin Americans hey Asians you're
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:56.000]  gonna get bailout money you're gonna get all this money from rich fat Americans
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.820]  who are greedy and have a high standard of living and boy they bellied up to the
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:03.200]  bar and said you bet we're ready to sign this and they got the treaty and
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.440]  they said what and the bankers want to kill the third world they're bunch of
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:11.200]  eugenicists who openly write books calling black people animals of course
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:14.820]  they want to cut off all your energy it's always been the globalist Western
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:18.520]  plan by the elites to stop development the third world that's in the British
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:23.160]  1949 Royal Commission on Population where they said if we industrialize the
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:27.080]  third world they will not overpopulate from their perspective they will then
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:31.800]  though be rivals to us and we won't have hegemonic control instead we'll keep them
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:35.720]  in the dark ages in the stone ages but it will make them then have giant
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:39.080]  populations because poor people have more kids on average so how do we deal
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:43.160]  with that well then we come in behind that with Planned Parenthood and
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:49.000]  sterilizations and forced abortions and pay India and pay Peru and pay African
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.360]  countries on record to forcefully grab women and sterilize them we're gonna
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:57.400]  keep you poor not let you industrialize and do our best to kill you keep you
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:03.720]  from having babies I mean these people are sick they are sick and they are the
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:08.360]  enemies of humanity so if you want to do something historical people like oh it
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:12.080]  won't do anything oh yes it will look how far we've come as I told you ten years
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.600]  ago we're pushing and pushing and making Bilderberg come out mainstream news to
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:21.200]  identify the real global controllers of this planet the real global controllers
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:26.640]  of this planet once you identify them then you're not looking at Obama or Bush
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:34.360]  or or Perry or or Sarkozy or Barroso you're looking at the real owners those
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:39.640]  those ten to eight families you can debate but we've written and posted a
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:43.720]  detailed analysis and info wars.com of the eight ruling families it's in the
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:49.240]  four horsemen of the New World Order piece that was up there last week and
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:52.680]  they can only get away with this if they're hidden that's why they go to
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:56.400]  such links to build a tunnel for hundreds of yards for them to drive into
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:02.160]  of you know white walls so nobody can get video of them in St. Mort Switzerland
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:05.440]  that's why they're shutting down the road that's why you heard from inside
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:09.560]  Bilderberg sources Rupert Murdoch was asked by Bilderberg to please talk to
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:13.080]  all the newspaper and media people he knows and ask them not to cover this
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:16.700]  here in the US but they have to cover it because we're covering it and the
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:20.200]  Drudge reports covering it and now it's one of the biggest news items in the
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:24.680]  world and it's only going to get bigger when you in Europe who are a few hours
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:29.120]  away hop a train and get in there and all you got to do is sit there and
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:33.120]  chant down with tyranny down with Bilderberg and as you're driving on
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.560]  your cell phone your car on the train call local media and tell them to be
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:41.920]  there and it's going to be an absolute fiasco for the Bilderberg group what
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:44.960]  it presents he say last year he says for the first time in human history
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:50.080]  humanity is awakened staring no longer they be able to be manipulated
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:55.760]  politically they understand the ruling class the Federal Reserve just five
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:58.880]  six years ago maybe five percent of Americans knew it was private knew it
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:02.680]  was a big scam was bankrupting our country for a dollar to be created a
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:07.720]  dollar of debt is created and given to them out of nothing they knew this they
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:13.680]  understood this and now I've seen the Gallup polls three years ago when Ron
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:17.320]  Paul was exposing it on the national platform being demonized it was upwards
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:23.680]  of 75 percent a year ago was 80 percent I've seen major scientific polls 85 and
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:27.960]  higher of Americans want to abolish the Fed audit the Fed and know they're the
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:31.640]  enemy and the bankers are going oops they're not looking at our Marionettes
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.620]  remember the old Bill Hicks line hey I like the puppet on the left hey I like
[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:41.000]  the puppet on the right and one guy goes hey there's one guy holding both
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:50.200]  puppets when humanity reaches that point and it has but everyone still feels
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:54.920]  like we're alone we're the minority no we're not no we're not you aren't public
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:17:00.600]  figures you aren't known you aren't recognized I cannot walk down the street
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:05.280]  anywhere I cannot go into 7-eleven I cannot go to a shopping mall I cannot go
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.840]  to a target I cannot go anywhere years ago I'd walk by 50 people and two
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:14.520]  groups would stop now I walk by a group of 50 people I get mobbed and I can't
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.640]  even get out of there because they all want to take photos and shake my hand
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:19.720]  and then it builds up because people have that you know thing that they're kind
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.520]  of scared to get outside they're bubble once they see people talking to me then
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:25.440]  they come over then they come over and it's great to talk to you I just got
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:30.080]  somewhere to go again I'm not bragging oh look Alex is a celebrity the point is

[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.680]  UK info warriors that listening to your show now get to St. Moritz get there as
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:55.720]  as fast as you can if you can borrow the money and get there and shout out
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:59.520]  because this affects this country as well I mean Alex you've given a lot of
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:03.600]  things as to dispensing to your sensational outburst there mention the
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:07.160]  genders that affect us already all over the world you know and higher interest
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:11.840]  rates I reckon that that's their policies that they're going to set their
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:16.040]  genders to I just rate 10 trails I reckon they're gonna enforce that even
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:20.120]  more oh yeah the CFR is called for more geoengineering they publicly admit
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:22.960]  their chemtrailing then if you tell the public they laugh at you they're
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:29.120]  changing the atmosphere and over 70% Monckton says it's 87% now of your laws
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:33.080]  are made by the unelected EU board controlled and chaired by Bilderberg
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:38.200]  minions I mean Rumpy and in Baroso are there right now getting their orders
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:44.760]  from the sinister royalty this is so disgusting so go face down the real
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:52.120]  enemy peacefully draw attention to them and I mean also you know I think in
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:56.720]  the other agenda that they're gonna enforce is a more rising gas and
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:01.480]  petrol petrol over a gas in America and another thing is I'm just in the video
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:07.200]  on YouTube is a video going up from the BBC or disinfo goon obviously in the
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:11.600]  BBC and the interview where he mentions truth that is mentally unstable though
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:18.760]  this in the video or not who is that what's his name I don't know it was just
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:22.080]  just been sent here about maybe half an hour ago that I haven't read what's all
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:26.480]  the way through it but basically if you from the BBC in this guy and so like a
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:31.040]  bit disinfo goon basically mention that all people believe not 9-11 inside job
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:35.160]  but a mentally unstable well that's what they're saying if you don't believe in
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.840]  global warming you should be arrested that's openly called for in the
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:41.400]  British Parliament now very very dangerous these are tyrants thank you
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:45.440]  so much Matt yeah if you don't believe wiener when he blamed Andrew Brett Bart
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:50.560]  for making up the photo and hacking a site turns out it was a total lie but
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:54.800]  still you got to believe wiener or you're mentally ill in fact I'm gonna be
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:00.280]  establishment wiener told the truth Brett Bart is bad and Bill Clinton didn't
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:05.400]  align that's right and we're supposed to believe what they say Joseph in Germany

[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:44.600]  information they have been hyping another force like terror attack here in
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:53.840]  Germany the 26th of the June it's the starting of the woman's soccer world
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:59.080]  league world league yeah they hype up that every event's gonna be struck so
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:02.480]  they have an excuse to stick their hands down your pants and train you for
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:06.760]  concentration camp out living you know Germany per capita has paid even more
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:11.320]  money than the US to these private bankers as bailouts and now Obama is
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:15.920]  trying to order Merkel to give even more of your tax money to the bankers in the
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:21.440]  name of saving the EU and I've seen polls of over 80% of Germans are outraged
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:26.600]  by this and Merkel almost lost her seat the last parliamentary run what are the
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:34.320]  Germans average view of these banker Nosferatu's well the Germans are very
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:39.680]  upset as you said and German the Germans feel like the German government is just
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:47.320]  like the the horse like pushing and working for the whole of Europe paying
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:53.320]  for Spain very painful grease paying for everyone and people people honestly
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:29:00.920]  don't like it as you said and another information I have is that the what the
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:05.560]  what the globalists want to do in the Middle East what they want to do in
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:11.080]  Pakistan is to take out the nuclear weapons of Pakistan so then they can
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:17.640]  stop their big war there well and they miss the what's the top they already said
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:26.320]  that the US was going to help help them to guard their nuclear facilities and
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:30.720]  that means quote take it over and have a coup Joseph from Germany you're planning

[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:21.160]  or you can get through on Skype on the 1-800-1800-259-9031 normally what we
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:24.480]  just give out the calls we can get you know a thousand and ten minutes if we
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:29.480]  want literally into our computer form phone board but from Europe we've got
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:34.560]  three callers lined up Paul Peter Nick and others I see rolling in there so
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:36.920]  we're going to talk to you in just a moment but I briefly wanted to point
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:42.120]  this out that growing up you know you're taught in school and college that third
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:46.920]  worlders are a bunch of idiot savages basically I mean it's done with a velvet
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:52.920]  glove but oh those people they just can't get themselves together and well
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:58.200]  that's not what's going on the colonial areas of Latin America Africa and
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:02.600]  southern Asia and other areas have been overrun by the more advanced
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:07.560]  technological militaries of the West repeatedly in the last 300 years and
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:12.280]  systems of tyranny are put in and then the last hundred years and this is main
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:16.640]  line history of your research this is not my opinion and major white papers
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:19.640]  were written by the British government the US government deployed gunboat
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:24.680]  diplomacy where they would give a dictator or give a thug saying Venezuela
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:29.280]  or Guatemala this goes back over a hundred years the US they give them a
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:32.760]  $20 million loan and openly it would come out tell them don't pay this back
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:37.160]  leaving one year with the money to Switzerland or to New York that's why
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:40.040]  a lot of Mexican presidents actually moved to New York after they steal a
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:44.240]  bunch of money just a few decades ago that happened or in the mid 90s so it's
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.720]  the same system or they go to Switzerland that's kind of the place
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:51.720]  where they nest and it's a free zone they allow and so and then the public's
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:56.560]  told well with interest it's been 10 years you know it's 20 million in 1905 you
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:01.360]  owe us 300 million and the country says you know back then that was before the
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:05.800]  inflation we have the it was equivalent to 300 billion or something they said
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:10.320]  we don't even make that in 20 years we can't pay it oh that's fine from the
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:17.560]  shores of Montezuma from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli and
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:21.520]  the Marine Corps top general two-time congressional Medal of Honor winner
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:24.880]  Spendley Butler finally quit and went public and said look it's all about
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:29.080]  money these people don't owe it we invade them and that's what's now
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:32.760]  happening here in America then I'm going to your calls that's what's now
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:36.920]  happening here and happening to Europe and the bankers said in the 2002 IMF
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:39.680]  World Bank documents they were going to do what they've done in the third world
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:44.200]  to us there's a reason the third world has you you got a major cities in the
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:47.480]  third world hundreds of thousands of homeless people and starvation and
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:51.360]  corrupt police and death and degradation it's because it's the
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:56.480]  globalist policy on record in the IMF World Bank documents that BBC was forced
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:01.840]  to cover to create a system to get them in debt through fraud and then never let
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:06.960]  them get out of it they want you to be poor now that's why I get so angry at
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:11.640]  these people they are assaulting me with high taxes they are assaulting us with
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:16.300]  carbon taxes they are assaulting us with government minders and secret
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:21.000]  police and spies I know history I know what happened in East Germany I'm
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.240]  angry about this I don't want to be a slave because I'm not gonna survive in
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:29.400]  that environment somebody some corrupt cop gets in my face starts bossing me
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:34.760]  around folks I go crazy I'm not a slave I'm red-blooded okay just like my
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:39.320]  ancestors I'm not putting up with this I want to fix it peacefully but I'm not
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:43.080]  gonna go along with this do you understand these people are crooks on
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:48.240]  record and they've got this Fingali mesmerized hoax running on people we

[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:01.680]  governments control our money and currency and take these mega bankers to
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:05.280]  present and you better know I'm risking my life coming straight at them and

[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:20.000]  alright I'm gonna stop ranting I'm gonna stop ranting let's go to Peter in
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.520]  Switzerland and Paul Nick John and others we got calls in Ireland
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:27.840]  Switzerland Italy you name it Scotland let's go to Peter in beautiful
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:32.360]  Switzerland Peter where are you and what's your view on this yeah hi hi Alex
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:37.600]  I'm in Zug Switzerland and I need to give you some information during the
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:44.460]  world economic forums in Davos there are usually these anti-world economic
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:50.840]  forum groups that try and get on the trains from core going up to Davos and
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:55.200]  it's a special train it's called the Red Bishop on and this is the same train
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:59.880]  that goes to St. Moritz and I just let you know that they either suspend the
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:05.680]  train service or they control everyone in core an hour and a half away before
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:10.160]  they get on the trains yeah you've got it in fact I've seen that and it's on
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:14.240]  record that the socialists they're gonna be there tomorrow openly or financed by
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:18.680]  the Bilderberg group to then make anybody who's anti Bilderberg look like a
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:21.760]  communist that's why we and I do it everywhere we've got to have real
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:28.040]  people who aren't camp following useful idiots there use car that's why you got
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:33.360]  two days leave now get there early don't wait because we need folks to mass
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:36.920]  there that's why they're hiding out they're sucking Europe and the rest of
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:40.600]  the world dry right now and that's why they're hiding out in the St. Moritz so
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:45.520]  so are you an American or a Canadian living in Switzerland dual citizen I'm
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:50.400]  a Swiss citizen also an American and trying to get down there I think is
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:54.240]  really going to be a challenge this weekend I tell you the Swiss are great
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:58.240]  people that's why they've got so much wealth and everybody's got guns and they
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:01.600]  got bunkers for the entire population you know the Ames are made up of what
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:08.840]  Germans Swiss and Dutch great people and I see a lot of top Swiss politicians
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:11.720]  your prime minister one of your the equivalent of one of your Congress
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:16.520]  people calling for some of the Bilderberg people's arrest and we've
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:19.400]  confirmed that's all over your papers that's pretty exciting what are the
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:25.280]  Swiss saying about now these vampires nesting roosting in St. Moritz people
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:29.080]  know about it I mean a lot of the Swiss I work with are very much aware of it and
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:33.000]  the Swiss papers have actually been very good covering these covering this
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:39.680]  event but again what I say is the Swiss know how to handle security and my fear
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:43.680]  is that they will be preventing people from getting on the trains already two
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:51.200]  hours from the destination okay but I mean that's only I mean is that all the
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:54.840]  time or are they just suspended the trains period for their lordships no
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:59.120]  they've done this during the World Economic Forum that the trains leave
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:03.800]  from core and that those trains went to Davos and they either suspended the
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:08.480]  trains or they controlled people before they even got on the trains and they're
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:12.480]  probably going to do the same thing heading down to St. Moritz and and and by
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:15.280]  controlling them at the checkpoint I mean they don't let you on the train
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:22.280]  correct well again that's because they're scared of the protests they're
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:27.800]  scared of the eye of the public brought to the mountain of Mordor so we can see
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:32.920]  the eye of Sauron sitting up there we've got a march on Mordor and and and it's
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:36.400]  going to be so historical I wish I could be there but I'm a man of my word I told
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:40.000]  talkers six months ago I'd be their keynote speaker and then a few weeks
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:43.720]  ago I was thinking about trying to go and be there Wednesday Thursday and then
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:48.080]  fly back Friday but I could have missed my keynote speech which is in the
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:53.880]  morning at talkers so I'm going to be in New York fly out tomorrow I wish I could
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:56.760]  be there and I've been in a lot of demonstrations I love them but folks
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:01.080]  this is going to be important this is going to draw massive attention to what's
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:06.960]  going on what do you suggest as as somebody from Switzerland sir what do
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:10.880]  you suggest we do to circumvent because there are good roads in there that's
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:17.960]  how Aaron and and Paul drove in from Zurich yes I just suggest they may have
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:21.960]  to go to a staging area and walk or take the public buses or something I
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:27.200]  don't know but I know from the anti-veth experience that they've actually
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:31.520]  controlled the trains so people have to be aware of that maybe you have to go
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:37.200]  pretending that you're planning to go on a go on a hike or something and and
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:41.040]  and demonstrate that you are or pretend that you're not going there to
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:45.880]  demonstrate now again the Swiss have some of the best rights in the world but
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:49.120]  the outsiders don't that's the way it's supposed to be in a sovereign country so
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:53.080]  I can't actually say it's bad but that's why it's important for Swiss to go
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:56.120]  because they can't from what I've read and correct me if I'm wrong they can't
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:00.880]  stop a Swiss citizen from getting on that train can they actually though they
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:05.720]  have they have stopped Swiss citizens if they were planning to protest yes but
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:09.280]  the Swiss have got some of the strongest protest rights anywhere that they need to
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:12.680]  follow complaints if that happens that's outrageous that Swiss would have their
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:18.200]  right of travel blocked for a bunch of outlying ouslanders coming in there
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:23.360]  well I gotta tell you in many ways this is a very secure place and security
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:29.360]  trumps pretty much everything else well they're not gonna stop people from this
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:32.920]  quest and we've got maps up on the site I'm not gonna be able to stop French
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:36.520]  driving in Germans driving in Italians driving in that's why if you're
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:40.560]  listening folks you've got to go and regardless shoot video them stopping at
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:44.520]  the train uploaded to YouTube everyone listening should upload to US and
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:47.480]  European YouTube they're trying to block everybody so you can't watch
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:50.480]  American YouTube's we can't watch European they don't want us to get
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:53.760]  together they want to geo-locate and they admittedly are trying to go after
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:57.440]  alternative press they're changing the algorithms by the way there's no doubt
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:01.400]  our term Bilderberg protests would have hit number one yesterday there is no
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:05.840]  doubt they've now created a catalog of names because classic anti-globalist
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:10.920]  names don't work now we do it only weird search terms that then link to articles
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:15.440]  we've written work so they're again the head of Google goes every year they are
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:18.760]  desperate to keep us from knowing they're there knowing who's there or
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:26.000]  protesting why is that Peter well I think these are the elites and they have
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.280]  their own agenda and what I don't understand is who who why why are
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:37.520]  people giving into their agenda why do governments give into this agenda because
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:40.520]  he who has the gold makes the rule and even though they're criminals they
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:43.680]  literally control trillions and they've bought and paid for almost everybody
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:47.960]  while we were asleep and now they're so arrogant they're burning down society to
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:51.200]  consolidate it and that's why they're hiding out in a rural area they
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:56.280]  normally go to very big resorts right on the beach but now the protests are so
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:00.000]  huge all over Europe they are literally hiding and that's why we must route them
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.800]  out and by God we will so you're gonna be going there aren't you Peter I will be
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:08.520]  trying to get down there yes and I'll find alternative ways to get in there if
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:12.320]  I have to God bless you we're gonna be talking to him we'll cover the aftermath
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:16.720]  of course the next week as well thank you so much Peter great job folks you
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:23.160]  know this is important march on tyranny peacefully let's go ahead and talk to Nick
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:29.000]  in Italy also bordering Switzerland Nick where are you in Italy yeah I don't
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.560]  Alex I'm actually in the city of Bologna which you mentioned so many times about
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:37.240]  the Bologna bombing so as a native of the city like you thank you for being the
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:41.360]  only American media personality actually mentioned that what did our government
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:46.640]  do the blame it on on their enemies yeah we're very sorry die 300 people are
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:50.000]  injuring dad and some of those guys are actually over there you said more it's
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.320]  party it up and you know I was born about nine and a half a month after the
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:59.000]  events so in my parents were there we're very close so I mean that's something
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.880]  every time you mention it you know I have a I get a little emotional about it
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:07.320]  because they're very close to me so and I want to just tell American folks how
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:11.120]  close this thing is to me and now what these guys are doing is just criminal
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:16.760]  there's no other words for it second of all you mentioned Asia now that they're
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:19.920]  gonna be a lot of election coming up in Asia they're just having in Burma they're
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:23.920]  going to be in Thailand and they were pushing one big thing in 2015 they will
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:27.960]  have something called the EAC the Asian economic community does that sounds
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:33.920]  familiar the EEC the European economic community we have the same thing yeah
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.800]  they're already signing deals emerging them now now I'm going from memory but
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:43.880]  where is Bologna how long will it take you to get into Switzerland I think to
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:47.520]  the border is about three to four hundred kilometers because you have to go past
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:51.720]  the land and then past the the the Alps mountains and then you have to go to
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:57.780]  St. Morris I mean I might have a chance to go I may actually have to pull some
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:01.560]  strings but I'm gonna reach right hard to get there because I wanted to go a few
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:06.000]  years ago when they had in the island of Supreza look look you got to go 20 years
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.960]  from now if these people win you are going to nash your teeth wishing you'd
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:15.360]  gone please please go do whatever you have to everybody go I mean it's so
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:19.620]  important as you said the same globalist almost killed your parents with
[01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:22.920]  that stage bombing in Bologna now declassify the Italian government admits
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:27.520]  it with NATO and US intelligence a bunch of bombings to be blamed on political
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:32.320]  enemies there then false flags you've got to go every person that goes is so
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:36.600]  important God bless you good to hear from you from Italy let's talk to Paul
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:41.800]  in Ireland and John in Scotland Paul thanks for holding you're on the year
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:49.600]  hello Alex hello the first thing I like to say is that this country Ireland
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:55.480]  very soon is going to collapse and many people are aware that there's a very
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:48:01.240]  great situation the best majority I think are still clueless as to what is
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:06.320]  the solution well you notice you were the fastest growing winner until you
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:09.760]  signed on to the Euro and suddenly they imploded you because that Euro treaty
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:13.280]  was the agreement to go under their receivership you've been economically
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:17.920]  conquered but I've seen it your Irish times your people it seems do know
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:25.720]  what's happening sorry go ahead well unfortunately the people were bullied into voting for
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:31.600]  for these treaties and finally they they bite the bait because money is so many
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:37.720]  yeah they voted no the first time yeah what Gerald Salenta said yesterday is
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:41.800]  absolutely correct and applies to this country that direct democracy now is the
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:46.720]  only answer I contacted yesterday the founder of the directorate direct
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:52.520]  democracy Ireland and told me about your program is that be here to listen to
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:59.680]  Gerald Salenta because the government we have here going back to Brian Cowan's
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:05.520]  government that column approach with the bankers with the bailouts was basically
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:10.200]  that when you're attacked by a mugger who says give me all your money or I'll
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:15.040]  shoot you well Brian Cowan as Prime Minister was the kind of man who would
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:19.560]  hand over the wallet and give everything now that we have a new government the
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:24.120]  policy of the new government that Andy Kenny is to make a deal with the mugger
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:29.160]  and pay by installments but you're going to lose everything anyway
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:33.280]  Irish think of a few months ago the head of your central banks saying it's good
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:36.840]  for Ireland to be run by foreign banks we're going under foreign banks control
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:42.720]  I mean it was just a total statement of treason out in the open
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:49.040]  unfortunately the people have been so brainwashed with what Colonel Robert
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:53.800]  Hixon of US Army intelligence called the perception management that he said
[01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:58.600]  one of the talks perception management as we called it in the CIA if you
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:04.160]  mentioned Bill DeBurne I'm talk maybe in this country you get this mixed as a
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:10.920]  lunatic and you know why because for 50 years they said it didn't exist and now
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:14.000]  there it is it okay it's no big deal but you're still crazy if you don't like it
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.680]  but we shut down whole countries for him to meet but they have no power we're
[01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:24.200]  being shut down here we were told that by privatizing our trash collection that
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:28.320]  is going to save money well it's saving it for the county but now I'm burdened
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:34.600]  with a crushing fee to pay every time my trash is collected and they tell us
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:38.400]  they get their schemes they're gonna put aside to help save us money it's
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:43.080]  horrible my friend I understand it's the austerity it's the scam thank you so

[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:02.440]  billion purchase of bonds so there's the signal for interest rates to go up but
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:07.680]  they're continuing QE to just not calling it QE three we also again have
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:13.000]  Obama saying more trillions must be given to quote the Greeks but didn't go to
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.960]  the Greeks it goes to the private banking cartels and most the money is
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:22.360]  not owed by the Greeks it's just it's how they lie and tell you this is a

[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:28.800]  read you something from today's Scottish Daily Mail newspaper yes sir and it's
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:34.600]  it's about as a quote from an admission from chief executive Stephen Hester who's
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:39.400]  the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland who received in 2008 the
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:44.880]  biggest bailout in UK history of 45 billion pounds which is about 70 billion
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:50.200]  dollars chief executive Stephen Hester provoked a furious reaction when he said
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:54.760]  there may have been some leakage from taxpayer funds to his senior staff's
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:59.120]  bonus pool more than 100 senior executives at the state-owned bank
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:06.040]  pocketed one million dollar plus salaries last year an additional 323
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:13.280]  K staff sharing 370 I've seen that it is just wall-to-wall absolute total

[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:24.560]  Bilderberg group it's interesting because the normal guy in my street who pays

[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:31.440]  page like yeah that's back in the Fox News is reporting he has rape gangs with
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:34.600]  Viagra even though three weeks ago the State Department admitted that was
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:40.920]  totally not true yeah of course man the current one minister in this country's
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:44.000]  being a Bilderberg I can't remember which yeah he's confirmed being a
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:50.200]  Bilderberger and his father Torvald Stoltenberg he's been many times man in
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:53.720]  this quite like I just realized because I went to a Bilderberger meeting last
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:59.800]  night was one of the only independent net net news webpages in this country
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:03.800]  there was like a meeting just about Bilderberger it's quite it is about 30
[02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:07.600]  people there was really interesting and while I really just realized how
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:12.200]  influential this guy is and how scary is man like it's this I mean I swear man
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:17.120]  this country is the is like a guinea pig for the new order man it's so
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:21.680]  technological the control group they have been placed in and like it's it's
[02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:26.080]  absolutely but but listen ten years ago a year ago there wouldn't be 30 people
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:30.120]  meeting in your town in Norway to discuss the real rulers of this planet
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:33.600]  that's the beginning of the end for these people they miscalculated they're
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:39.880]  gonna lose good job Gareth Tabet calling us from Saudi Arabia you're on the

[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:44.240]  was simply a military coup what's happened in Tunisia has devastated Tunisia
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:53.080]  and Egypt in Yemen you see killings in the signs of regime change other
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:04:00.280]  countries interfering with Yemen's policies in Syria you see massacres
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:10.600]  happening ganged ganged groups attacking civilians so it's basically a war on
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:16.080]  the on the Arab world as we as we are up see it it's a destabilization and then

[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:46.640]  addressed your major governments you name it and I remember hearing on a four
[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:51.280]  five months ago that she had breast cancer and that she was gonna undergo
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:54.680]  treatment chemotherapy and then I talked to Ted the other day I didn't mean to
[02:08:54.680 --> 02:08:58.680]  get into it on air and Ted said yeah I talked to kathryn she's got stage three
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:02.720]  her words pushing stage four and then I took that to mean that you know there was
[02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:06.160]  good chance we could lose her and I went on air and said let's all pray for her
[02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:09.200]  and well I hope I hate to talk about this while she's on the line but I hope
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:12.520]  that you know why isn't the good guy young we need to pray for her and then
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:16.400]  kathryn I was I didn't hear it but I was told because one of my crew was
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:19.760]  listening in the car here locally she's on locally and her saying well no she's
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:23.600]  fighting she's good she's gonna beat it and that's the attitude and and when I
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:27.640]  got flooded with thousands of emails and hundreds of calls you know saying she
[02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:31.200]  needs to take intervening as vitamin C she needs to do this and that I know
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:36.840]  she's into nutrition she's clearly will talk to her but I apologize if it
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:41.640]  caused her too big a problem with the outpouring of concern for folks but
[02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:45.200]  she says nope she's gonna beat it and she's not stage four she's stage three
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:49.040]  and I called Ted back and said now you told me that he said well she just said
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:53.200]  she's stage three pushing stage four was the quote but what we've got her here
[02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:57.960]  to talk about that with us today and also her incredible work really being
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:02.120]  instrumental as a lightning rod worldwide a doctor Katherine Albrecht

[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:13.960]  TSA scanners I mean she's really been a big challenge to them analyzing what
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:19.160]  the technocrats are doing and so we'll also talk some about that with her here
[02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:22.480]  today launching big famous boycotts against Gillette that made them stop

[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:03.040]  again I'm sorry they got messed up in translation it's just that I get on
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:07.560]  air I've been told something by Ted the honor of Genesis that I got I guess a
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:10.880]  little bit wrong thank God and then I got a little emotional at the end of the
[02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:13.680]  show and just brought it up I wasn't gonna talk about it actually till I've
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:16.520]  talked to you and I've been planning to get you on the show talk about a host
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:20.920]  issues and you know how it is now months go by like like like seconds I mean it's
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:25.720]  just I wake up and it's a new year so we've definitely as soon as you're able
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:29.120]  I want to have you up for a full hour I know coming up in a few weeks you're
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:32.560]  gonna quit or in a week or so you're gonna quit your weekday show and go to
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:36.920]  the weekends Catherine first tell us about that and then tell us about your
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:40.360]  work which I know so many of us are proud of and you've been a great example
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:45.640]  to all of us exposing tyranny well you know I've been working ever since the
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:50.160]  spy chips days in fact even before that in 1989 I founded no cards dot org which
[02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:54.440]  is the website that opposes the supermarket frequent shopper cards a lot
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:58.840]  of people in Texas and elsewhere joining me in big protests against the role
[02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:02.760]  out of those cards which basically are food registration systems they've now
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:06.560]  gone worldwide they've got these things installed in Yemen and Jamaica and
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:11.560]  Korea and you name it to to essentially require a card to buy your groceries so
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:15.040]  they know everything you buy itemize it know when you have a baby whether you've
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:18.320]  got a cat whether you have you know diabetes you name it it's all in there
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:22.400]  so I did that initially no cards that organ then of course spy chips came out
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:26.600]  that's our best-selling book that exposed all the the shenanigans with
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:31.240]  radio frequency identification microchips or RFID been working on that
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:34.880]  for quite some time we have a new website out I want to refer your listeners to
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:39.360]  which is chip me not dot com and that's based on the research that I did along
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:43.760]  with the Associated Press to expose the fact that those implantable microchips
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:48.880]  are causing cancer in dogs and cats and now we've got a big push over in the
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:53.480]  UK where they're saying they want to make microchipping animals mandatory we
[02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:57.160]  just had the California blue is the California State Senate just passed a
[02:12:57.160 --> 02:13:02.320]  bill that will require all shelter animals in California to get microchipped
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:06.160]  so I would encourage everybody chip me not dot com we've got the case studies
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:09.880]  and the stories of the animals that have developed cancer around those
[02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:14.680]  microchips fast-growing tumors and in fact we do know that between one and
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:18.480]  10% of laboratory animals were talking mice and rats when you implant them
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:23.120]  with a microchip develop a fast-growing tumor that eventually kills them so
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:27.360]  dangerous stuff we should not be messing with microchips in living flesh
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:32.800]  certainly not in laboratory animals not in pets and definitely not in human
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:36.160]  beings so chip me not dot com is the website there's a big lawsuit out I
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:40.600]  want to let people know about against Merck and Merck is the parent company of
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:45.360]  the the home again microchips people probably seen the ads for home again
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:49.560]  you know hey chip your dog chip your cat well there's a lawsuit out by a woman
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:53.680]  here in Massachusetts whose cat developed cancer around the microchip and
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:57.240]  she's doing them for the vet expenses and there's major studies that show that
[02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:01.520]  but also see ads everywhere now getting everybody ready for microchips in pills
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:07.200]  that big farm is putting out you got it that while ultimately Alex is as you
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:10.640]  know it probably better than anybody else the plan is to microchip every
[02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:15.600]  physical object on earth every tree every bumblebee they've actually done
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:19.800]  that they've actually put tiny little microchips on bumblebee smart dirt and
[02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:24.320]  the Pentagon says they can then search the real world like Google and actually
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:28.760]  predict the future they're coming to build a computerized crystal ball is
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:33.440]  there is there holy grail yeah it's it's insanity and then you combine that with
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:38.280]  what Google's up to you know speaking of Google I can't remember Mr. Gay Brin or
[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:41.240]  Larry Page but one of the founders of Google said when asked hey what do you
[02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:45.760]  want Google to ultimately become they said like the mind of God so you look
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:49.920]  at it that going okay so you guys want to know everything about everything at
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:55.240]  all times which is exactly what God does God is omniscient and omnipotent and you
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:59.200]  know Google and IBM and all these companies they're angling for that same
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:02.680]  kind of power and control and that's where you get into all of the micro
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:06.360]  chipping that's also where you get into all of the Google products that spy on
[02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:10.360]  people and I always make a point of saying anytime I have an opportunity if
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:14.240]  you have a Gmail account or even if you don't have a Gmail account but you
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:18.960]  write to someone with a Gmail account Google reads all of your email they take
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:23.000]  all the keywords out of there and they put them into a database with your name
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:26.720]  at the top so they know what you're writing to people about I've even had
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:30.560]  the creepy experience where someone wrote to me through my radio show at
[02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:35.400]  Catherine Albrecht.com they just sent me an email and I wrote them back and then
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:38.920]  they said it was the creepiest thing our email had nothing to do with RFID but
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:43.240]  they said every website they went on after that was running RFID ads. Oh let me
[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:46.480]  stop you I remember five years ago Paul Watson wrote an article about it people
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:50.040]  couldn't believe it Google put out a press release to stockholders saying oh
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:53.700]  great news we're now going to use the camera and microphone to listen to
[02:15:53.700 --> 02:15:57.560]  keywords in your house on the computer but don't worry a human isn't doing it
[02:15:57.560 --> 02:16:01.240]  a computer is doing it so it's all right and then we use that to tailor the ads
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:04.760]  and then now schools come out and say yeah we're watching your kids at home
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:09.000]  over the government issue computers I mean this they have just broken the damn
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:13.960]  with this stuff now throwing it in our face it's all completely illegal but
[02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:18.200]  they trick you to sign on to it and wave your rights Catherine this is scary I
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:21.440]  mean if this isn't the mark of the beast it might as well be. Well I think we're
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:25.160]  coming to that point Alex and especially now Google's got its new Google wallet
[02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:28.080]  where you can make your payments through your cell phone of course I know
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:31.600]  you've talked about that on your show and you know it's we're coming to the
[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:34.880]  point where we're going to be eliminating cash and this omnipotence that I was
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:39.040]  talking about Google wanting to be the mind of God you know once that gets
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:42.840]  together with with government and of course China's been hacking into Google
[02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:46.320]  and trying to get a hold of those records the government knows that Google
[02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:50.440]  has more powerful records than anything it has Google knows more about you than
[02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:55.240]  the NSA the FBI the CIA and the IRS combined because we all log on to their
[02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:58.760]  search engine and punch in all of our information all day long so it's a
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:02.080]  beautiful honey trap to get people to come on and and tell what they're
[02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:04.480]  thinking about by the way this is a good opportunity for me to give you my
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:10.040]  really good news which is that start page is now serving full Google results so
[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:13.320]  for people who I know that many people heard about it first from you start
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:17.320]  page.com which is the private search engine alternative to Google has now
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:21.720]  switched over and is returning 100% Google results so there's really no
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:26.840]  more excuse for people to be using Google if you want the good Google results
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:29.960]  and I will be the first to admit they've got the best results search results on
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:33.760]  the Internet because they're the NSA it's really a public NSA so we would accept
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:38.800]  it but it's now admitted it was NSA CIA money funded and start page.com is so
[02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:43.560]  incredible and you're the spokesman for start page and people should all use
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:47.320]  start page.com I'm glad you brought that up Katherine. Well and what's what's
[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:52.200]  changed now Alex since we last spoke is that start page is now actually so you
[02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:56.360]  put in your query you look up whatever the IRS or or 9th amendment whatever
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:59.680]  you're looking at isn't it really a proxy now with that function so so so
[02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:04.880]  so they're a shield in front of you and so what they'll do they take your query
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:08.720]  they submit it to Google but not through your ISP they do it through their
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:12.440]  servers in California and in the Netherlands they get back the results
[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:15.880]  they serve them to you with total privacy nobody records your IP address
[02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:19.080]  nobody puts cookies on your browser reads any cookies it's third party
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:24.520]  certified and it even has SSL encryption so start page.com I'm as you as you
[02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:27.760]  mentioned I'm a spokesperson because I had them on my radio show two years ago
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:32.000]  just as a guest and I said you know I'm sick of Google what can I do instead and
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:35.600]  I fell in love with this company and a lot of people said why don't want to use
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:39.440]  start page because I want Google results and so we said well well why don't we
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:42.400]  just start returning Google results now I know there's a lot of people listening
[02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:45.960]  or probably like Google yuck I don't want anything to do with them and that's
[02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:50.280]  why xquik.com which is the parent company of StarPage is still returning
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:53.720]  results from everybody but Google so if you're one of those folks who doesn't
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:56.840]  even want to see the word Google on your screen you can go to xquik and that's
[02:18:56.840 --> 02:19:02.600]  I-X-Q-U-I-C-K xquik.com where third party you know it does the same thing but
[02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:05.440]  with everybody but Google. Well Catherine we gotta shift gears from
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:08.840]  because we're going to break I just want to say this listening to you you travel
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:12.160]  all over the world you've got all these organizations you've done so much you're

[02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:23.280]  Catherine Albright Catherine Albright calm you know there and check out all
[02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:27.520]  the other websites organizations this invaluable information Catherine I'm
[02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:34.160]  also sorry when we made that not entirely correct announcement on the show a
[02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:37.960]  few days ago that we crashed your website but hopefully folks will visit
[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:42.800]  visited again and we'll get all the info but won't crash it so much more is
[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:47.160]  happening on the privacy front you're you're you're looking into so many facets
[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:51.800]  of big brothers offensive against free humanity what is front and center on
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:55.680]  your radar right now what's the biggest growing threat against liberty right now
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:25:00.520]  well I think all this RFID step that we talked about when we were when we were
[02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:05.200]  researching spy chips our book is has all come to pass we're seeing radio
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:10.120]  frequency devices or remotely trackable microchips being put into driver's
[02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:14.080]  licenses this is happening in border states all over the country if you border
[02:25:14.080 --> 02:25:18.040]  on Canada or Mexico there's a good chance that your state offers something
[02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:21.680]  called an enhanced drivers license which is a driver's license that can be read
[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:26.360]  from 30 or even 60 feet away by somebody in a moving car driving down the
[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:28.960]  street they can read it right through your wallet if you're stupid enough to
[02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:33.120]  have one of these things in your wallet the State Department is promoting it as
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:36.560]  a way to replace your passport why bother going through the expense and bother
[02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:40.600]  getting a passport if you can just get your driver's license to serve as a
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:45.080]  border crossing card into Canada or Mexico so if your state offers an enhanced
[02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:48.520]  driver's license say no to it if you know anybody who has gotten one of these
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:52.360]  things encourage them to cut it up send it back get rid of it because they're
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:56.160]  trackable and here's what gets even weirder Alex if you walk into if you
[02:25:56.160 --> 02:25:59.800]  got one of those things in your pocket or in your purse and you walk into a
[02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:04.040]  Walmart store and you walk up to the fruit of the loom briefs hanging there
[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:07.840]  in the underwear shelf of the men's section I kid you not Walmart's
[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:14.040]  underwear shelf can read your driver's license through your pocket and now
[02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:17.720]  they're saying oh the RFID in your driver's license you'll pay now in the
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:21.600]  future soon and you'll wave your wallet you'll wave your cell phone and the new
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:25.880]  iPhones are coming out with a chip in them where even if you don't want to
[02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:28.440]  they're gonna be able to do this and they admit thieves are now stealing all
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:34.320]  this so their answer is well you'll pay by chip and face scan and so that's what
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:37.700]  they're forcing in now also with the airports they're rolling out the new
[02:26:37.700 --> 02:26:42.040]  retina scanners as we knew they would do inside the body scanners but don't
[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:46.720]  worry they microwave you faster now you walk through as they microwave and it
[02:26:46.720 --> 02:26:51.040]  retina scans you passively it's so easy yeah it's mind-blowing so we're taking
[02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:55.840]  all of the essentially everything that individual freedom activists have been
[02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:59.640]  railing about sort of in our own corners here all of the biometrics you got
[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:03.640]  people worried about that all of the national ID card stuff we've got people
[02:27:03.640 --> 02:27:08.080]  concerned about that the RFID and now the cell phone and what I tell people
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:12.240]  nowadays is that with with 80 to 90 percent cell phone penetration I mean
[02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:16.040]  you've got virtually everybody carrying one of these things the cell phone is no
[02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:20.120]  longer really a phone if you think about it it's a camera it's a video
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:24.360]  camera it's a listening device it's a microphone it's a tracking call it your
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:28.800]  guardian devil it's a guardian devil you know God has an angel watching and
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:32.040]  recording it's your little guardian devil and it fries you and gives you
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:35.720]  cancer while it spies on you that's a good way of putting it and you know I
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:40.760]  gotta say this because on on everybody's iPhone what is the picture there it's an
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:44.840]  apple with a bite taken out of it you know folks pay attention here that is
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:48.600]  the symbol straight out of the Garden of Eden and it symbolizes the deal that
[02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:52.400]  that humanity struck with Satan what what were people told they were said
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:55.760]  don't eat from the fruit of that tree of knowledge because if you do your
[02:27:55.760 --> 02:28:00.200]  surely die and people said oh well okay and they ate you know Adam and Eve ate
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:04.480]  the apple and Satan said alright well you made your trade you get to surely die
[02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:07.680]  on the basis of his knowledge but I'm going to give you all the technology you
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:11.200]  could ever use and you will have the powers of God and that's what we're
[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:14.800]  screwing around with today you know you you don't have to look too far to see
[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:19.000]  Fukushima and and radiation meltdowns you know the drill and everybody
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:22.280]  listening of course if they listen to your show they're well-informed all of
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:26.000]  that stuff ties into a deal that was struck way back when in the garden and
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:30.320]  we're carrying around these devices that have that big hunket apple symbol with
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:34.240]  the bite taken out of it and by the way even if people don't believe in God in
[02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:38.840]  the devil I do I know you do the elites do I mean the symbol of Apple for Apple
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:44.320]  is an apple with the bite out the tree the tree of good and evil that knowledge
[02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:48.840]  and it's here and they're using it to totally control us and they kill us
[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:52.160]  while we get the knowledge so they're physically killing us and they're
[02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:56.840]  telling us we're killing you because these devils always have to tell you in
[02:28:56.840 --> 02:29:00.520]  a code what they're going to do to you yeah and you know we're getting
[02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:04.760]  irradiated by the cell phone towers the new report out from from Europe saying
[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:08.680]  we ought to pull all of the Wi-Fi and all of the cell phone towers out of and
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:12.640]  away from schools because they're so bad for children you know the stuff is
[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:17.240]  killing us the reality is it is and it but it's always told you with a
[02:29:17.240 --> 02:29:20.760]  benefit there's a there's a great quote we opened our books by chips with a
[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:24.760]  quote by C.P. Snow who was a writer for the New York Times and he said
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:28.680]  technology is a queer thing it gives you great gifts with one hand it stabs you
[02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:31.440]  in the back with the other so that's kind of the direction we're going
[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:34.800]  Catherine Albright calm stay strong we're all praying for you and hopefully I

[02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:09.200]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:13.520]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:17.480]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:31:17.480 --> 02:31:21.840]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[02:31:21.840 --> 02:31:26.160]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[02:31:26.160 --> 02:31:29.920]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:34.040]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:31:34.040 --> 02:31:38.000]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:41.840]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:44.560]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:30.680]  thank you for joining us for live coverage from Bilderberg 2011 we're
[02:33:30.680 --> 02:33:37.600]  joined by Paul Joseph Watson who is right outside the global elite meeting
[02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:42.520]  place in St. Moritz Switzerland these are the people the heads of the global
[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:47.440]  mega banks British Dutch royalty the Rockefellers the Rothschilds attending
[02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:52.480]  and we have more of their inside agenda that we're going to be going over here
[02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:55.200]  and this is so important because these are the people that control the
[02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:59.440]  parliaments control the leadership of our Congress our House and Senate they're
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:03.200]  the folks we've gotten their minutes from decades ago how they covertly set up
[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:08.600]  the euro how they sold government's derivatives to implode them they're the
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:13.040]  people that want the carbon taxes to shut down in the industrial societies
[02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:17.600]  these are the bad guys my friends and now Obama has pledged as we told you
[02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:22.760]  weeks ago from our Bilderberg sources he would do trillions more to quote bailout
[02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:27.160]  Greece that means give the private banks that made the derivative fraud and got
[02:34:27.160 --> 02:34:31.240]  government to get involved with it that means giving the mega banks that are
[02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:35.800]  making record profits more of our tax money we've seen a lot of big
[02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:39.520]  developments the last few days at Bilderberg and joining us to go over
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:42.720]  those developments is Paul Joseph Watson of info wars.com and
[02:34:42.720 --> 02:34:47.600]  prisonbunna.com and of course Aaron Dyke so also working in our operation
[02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:52.520]  there Paul Watson you've got the floor break down the spectrum of
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:35:01.720]  reportage hello Alex good to be back yeah one thing that I failed to mention earlier was the fight that quite early on in
[02:35:01.720 --> 02:35:05.800]  proceeding this morning there was a activist I think he was associated with
[02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:10.800]  we are changed Switzerland who spray painted the graffiti on the road that
[02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:16.080]  led up to the entrance to the Bilderberg hotel and he basically spray painted
[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:20.440]  things like you know you're not welcome in Switzerland get out Bilderberg's gun
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:26.160]  things like that and obviously he was approached by the police but because the
[02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:31.240]  spray paint that he was using could easily wash off and in fact it did late
[02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:36.840]  to wash off with a constant rain they didn't arrest him or detain him so yet
[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:40.840]  he had a pretty long conversation with the police but eventually they just had
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:44.560]  to walk away because of this technicality in the law so a lot of
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:49.000]  Bilderberg members arrived to this message of you know get out of Switzerland
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:54.720]  Bilderberg scum new world orders scum so that was a nice welcome for them going
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:35:58.720]  over the incredible information that Tucker has now released more of their
[02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:02.840]  agenda and we've looked it up it is in the Swiss papers the prime minister is
[02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:06.240]  saying that it's not good to have them there and that they the Bilderberg group
[02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:09.840]  wants to destroy their sovereignty and we have the equivalent of one of their
[02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:13.640]  top congressmen saying arrest Henry Kissinger because there's a rest warrants
[02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:18.200]  out for him out of France and other areas we also have other government leaders
[02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:22.240]  saying they don't want them there so very exciting things happening there's a
[02:36:22.240 --> 02:36:27.160]  lot more in the agenda they want to have a larger war in the Middle East and
[02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:30.480]  we're going to go over some of that in a moment but breaking down the fake bomb
[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:36.640]  scare today and other things that are happening this report that a Bilderberg
[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:40.160]  person flew into the airport and had some type of medical emergency Paul
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:46.120]  cover the waterfront for us well the fake bomb scare obviously occurred when
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:50.120]  we had left our car at the top of the hill and walked down to the bottom to
[02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:54.320]  get some better shots of the cars as they were arriving then Aaron went back up
[02:36:54.320 --> 02:36:57.880]  to the top of the hill and the road was blocked and he was told that there had
[02:36:57.880 --> 02:37:02.280]  been a bomb scare involving some tubing that the police had found them that they
[02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:09.440]  had arrested two people so it took about an hour before the blockade was
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:14.560]  lifted which was you know the blockade itself was very brief which led us to
[02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:20.600]  believe and other people that we've spoken to agree with the journalist this
[02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:25.000]  was because of a very important official was arriving at that time and they
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:30.440]  wanted to widen the security area to make sure that you know that elitist
[02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:34.480]  wasn't bothered because it the whole thing was lifted so quickly but it was
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:39.040]  obviously a spur of the moment thing and it let me stop you because this needs
[02:37:39.040 --> 02:37:42.720]  to be added to our report that's one of the top links up on drudge you're
[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:46.880]  telling me I was just from the police who told you it was the bomb scare I
[02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:51.760]  know that's on video but specifically that they say they did make a rest for
[02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:56.400]  tubing I mean that's huge news arrest made at Bilderberg for supposed pipe
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:38:02.000]  bombs is that what you're saying we were told by other journalists that two
[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:07.400]  people had been arrested we can't confirm that and there was no information as to
[02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:11.480]  their identity but that was what numerous people who were there at the time
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:15.680]  said so we don't know for sure whether that's true but that that's what would
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:21.120]  circulate thing at the time well we'll call the police station continuing with
[02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:24.080]  other things that are unfolding well what do you think's most striking from
[02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:29.960]  Tucker's moles that we've learned that's on the agenda wanting to keep the
[02:38:29.960 --> 02:38:32.840]  depression going I think it's the big one wanting to have a World War three
[02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:38.360]  event in the Middle East this is huge yeah just before I get onto that one
[02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:43.940]  final point on those arrests but there were several people who told us that
[02:38:43.940 --> 02:38:49.720]  these two individuals who were arrested had previously had no affiliation with
[02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:53.520]  the journalist who were there the day before so it seems that these two
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:57.960]  individuals were unknown to everyone else who was there on the scene so that
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:01.720]  obviously brings up the possibility that they were provocateurs well we saw
[02:39:01.720 --> 02:39:05.720]  that happen in 2008 Chantilly with Obama and Hillary meetings secretly and
[02:39:05.720 --> 02:39:08.720]  that was later confirmed they were there that they had this guy with a video
[02:39:08.720 --> 02:39:12.920]  camera videotaping all of us acting like a cop then he got quote busted for a
[02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:18.000]  gun and they showed the you know the media this and then they let him go I
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:22.640]  mean come on and again this is all part of a way to demonize in front of the
[02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:28.440]  other cops that see protesting as bad yeah we couldn't confirm those two
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:32.200]  arrests but the police chief told Aaron directly that there was a bombscare so
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:36.480]  that is a hundred percent confirmed getting on to what Tucker found out
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:41.200]  about the agenda obviously covered in Kurt Nimmo's article which is at on
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:45.520]  info wars dot com is the fact that they're outraged and this was the
[02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:49.320]  familiar theme at last year's conference about the fact that they get
[02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:52.960]  increasing amount scrutiny from the alternative media and the page movement
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:57.800]  I was talking to Tucker about an hour ago and he was telling me that one of the
[02:39:57.800 --> 02:40:01.720]  reasons they want to prolong the recession it's obviously not the only
[02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:06.360]  reason was that they want to keep the middle class down they want to keep the
[02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:09.880]  problems you know low down so they can't afford to travel and they can't
[02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:13.680]  afford to where focus on Builder because they're too concerned about putting
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:18.520]  food on the table so similar to what they said last year about you know that
[02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:22.160]  they're discussed that people who are actually able to afford to travel to
[02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:25.880]  these different countries in which they meet that was another familiar theme
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:30.720]  coming out today according to Jim Tucker well that before you continue that's
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:35.840]  what austerity is that's what the head of God or Space Center has said that's
[02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:39.720]  what the head of the UN climate program or a strong has said and Ted Turner and
[02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:43.600]  Prince Philip and all their reports is you will only be allowed to be in the
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:48.600]  area that that you are working in you'll have to get special credits to travel
[02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:53.240]  outside special authorization to fly on an airplane and now as you know in
[02:40:53.240 --> 02:40:57.520]  England they're showing British school children these government-funded and
[02:40:57.520 --> 02:41:02.200]  corporate funded cartoons where it shows the future in ten years where the
[02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:05.680]  woman's going it's my husband's birthday I've got the credits for him to eat meat
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:09.160]  once a year he's not allowed to travel out of the zone but I am because I'm a
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:13.160]  social worker and and people watch the videos and think they're a joke about
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:17.720]  some tyranny they're not the sociologists and the psych warfare
[02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:21.840]  experts are just showing this to kids like it's normal and we've played those
[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:26.440]  here people think that's a joke no no it's not a joke Paul tell tell folks
[02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:31.520]  about this well I mean that all comes out of the royal society in the big
[02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:36.160]  think tanks in the UK they've openly announced that they want this planned
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:40.960]  apocalypse where only the elite and the rich will be able to drive cars where
[02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:45.600]  meat will be rationed as it was in communist China even as recently as the
[02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:50.320]  80s and where basically the living standards of the West are lowered to a
[02:41:50.320 --> 02:41:55.680]  second and third world status as this post industrial revolution takes hold
[02:41:55.680 --> 02:42:00.320]  and that's what the tyrants do the Russians had meat the Chinese had meat
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:04.600]  they do it to make you line up so they have the control and that was later
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:08.200]  declassified they know that's why Stalin wouldn't let the Ukrainians and
[02:42:08.200 --> 02:42:11.840]  others grow their own food in tens of millions starved to death they banned
[02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:16.720]  your own low garden that's what the food safety act and codex elementaries is
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:21.440]  about go ahead well in the planned apocalypse clip which is coming out of
[02:42:21.440 --> 02:42:27.480]  these elite think tanks they present a global food council which will decide
[02:42:27.480 --> 02:42:31.960]  all your rations all your meat all your vegetables that everything that you're
[02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:36.800]  allowed to get and that as he just said Hawks back to the stall in his era it
[02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:41.920]  Hawks back to Maoist China where you know people didn't just have to line up to
[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:47.480]  get me meat was a special treat and Monsanto has said that that's why
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:50.680]  they're infecting everything with their GMO because in the future well it's
[02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:54.480]  already happened almost every major corn wheat you name it is infected with
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:57.520]  their genetics even if you didn't have their seed it gets into the other
[02:42:57.520 --> 02:43:02.160]  plants and if they find one percent of their genetics then your SWAT team so
[02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:06.160]  you won't be able to have a farmer ranch because it's copyrighted it's
[02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:09.480]  patented you won't be able to grow anything because they've infected
[02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:13.240]  everything and then the courts rule that they haven't they haven't polluted you
[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:17.600]  you've stolen from them even though it's admitted they polluted you this is the
[02:43:17.600 --> 02:43:23.920]  master takeover plan you've got to admit their geniuses well yeah that's
[02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:27.320]  that's exactly what they're gonna be talking about the moment another thing
[02:43:27.320 --> 02:43:32.000]  which I don't I can't remember if I mentioned early but because of all these
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:35.840]  delays with the problems coming into the local airport the fact that many of
[02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:40.240]  them have had to be re-routed to the Zurich airport three hours away which
[02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:45.040]  was borne out by the fact that very few cars if you think about you know you've
[02:43:45.040 --> 02:43:49.920]  got a hundred and twenty hundred thirty members coming to this meeting it looked
[02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:55.280]  like at least half of them haven't even made it yet which led to a lot of talk
[02:43:55.280 --> 02:43:59.360]  about the fact that the conference has been postponed the official start of it
[02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:03.440]  until tomorrow morning so that's when they'll actually get down to business
[02:44:03.440 --> 02:44:09.160]  with the agenda so the delays due to the weather and due to the low cloud cover
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:13.520]  of course the Bilderberg meeting to be delayed by one day
[02:44:13.520 --> 02:44:18.200]  oh the gods are having trouble as they see themselves landing at their Mount
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:24.120]  Olympus their little their little perch while they drop their droppings on on
[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:29.560]  the little surfs other facets of the Bilderberg agenda that we're now
[02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:34.640]  learning that are absolutely outraging them we know that they do have the
[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:38.360]  Google execs there and others they want to clamp down on free speech and we see
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:42.360]  that manifested by the EU and others calling for these Durkhanian net rules
[02:44:42.360 --> 02:44:48.240]  Paul yeah yeah that's what Tucker came out with the fight that they're still
[02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:53.040]  incensed about the free reign that the internet gives alternative media to
[02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:58.000]  shine the spotlight on this gaggle of criminals and according to Tucker that's
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:04.280]  on the agenda this year so it's about clamping down on free speech and stopping
[02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:08.320]  all the people who were assembled there today from getting anywhere near Bilderberg
[02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:15.280]  as they hid their faces while driving past in their tinted windowed cars the
[02:45:15.280 --> 02:45:20.440]  the tint on the windows seemed to be almost black so you couldn't see in the
[02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:25.520]  cars without a special lens which would enable you to do so so we still managed
[02:45:25.520 --> 02:45:29.960]  to get some good photos though specifically of people like we believe
[02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:35.160]  to be Pearl and Anders Rasmussen the NATO head which would obviously verify the
[02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:41.000]  fact that Libya is top of the agenda as Tucker said with Bilderberg furious
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:46.360]  about the US Congress putting a roadblock in to stop Obama's war in
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:51.240]  Libya now you saw Bill Gates but we're able to get a photo of that and I know
[02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:54.880]  soon those will be uploaded at info wars.com and prisonpana.com that's the
[02:45:54.880 --> 02:46:00.040]  next thing you're gonna do do we have a photo of a little population reduction
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:06.360]  Billy Gates we did get a photo of it but it was very blurred at the time we
[02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:10.520]  need to go in and try and sharpen it up which is why we we said that we're not
[02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:15.240]  100% sure that it was him but I mean that's the closest resemblance that we
[02:46:15.240 --> 02:46:19.000]  could see that it was Bill Gates obviously he was there last year in
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:23.680]  Spain so it's obviously not out of the question that you would be there again
[02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:28.480]  all right Paul good job please hand the phone over to Aaron Dykes info wars
[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:31.440]  reporter and then I'll be talking to you guys during the break coming up but
[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:37.280]  let's go ahead and bring Aaron Dykes up here now Aaron what's your view on what
[02:46:37.280 --> 02:46:41.920]  you're witnessing there in Switzerland as the global cockroaches the global
[02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:47.000]  crime syndicate meets I think they're quite furious that even in the remote
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:52.600]  rather elite ski town that people are still willing to show up and show their
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:58.000]  faces and protests of the group Alex in addition to the names Alex mentioned I
[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:04.000]  spoke to four or five separate people who all separately saw David Rockefeller
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:09.520]  at least some of them have it on video good nose will be getting uploaded soon
[02:47:09.520 --> 02:47:14.560]  we'll put that together on the sides continue other things you've noticed
[02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:20.720]  yeah there's also a possible siding I'm consulting my footage as quickly as I
[02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:28.200]  can of Matthias Noss the editor of Dizite the Times in Germany and he's always
[02:47:28.200 --> 02:47:32.920]  in an annual attendee he's on the steering committee as well and we have
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:39.040]  other photos too of a shadow we've rather vampire looking European members
[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:42.600]  have come in and we're gonna go through the list and try to identify them as
[02:47:42.600 --> 02:47:47.840]  well Alex what about the whole ridiculous bomb scare recap other
[02:47:47.840 --> 02:47:53.960]  developments for us well it's obviously a hoax it's pretty see-through but the
[02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:57.840]  police chief was quite straight-faced in making sure nobody was gonna come or go
[02:47:57.840 --> 02:48:03.200]  and he didn't mind telling me he could care less if my car was available or if
[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:07.960]  it be towed away or anything or collateral damage in there hoax false
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:12.920]  flags set up to keep the protesters farther from the perimeter and of course
[02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:17.800]  yesterday we reported how they had a veil set up to prevent identifying the
[02:48:17.800 --> 02:48:22.480]  members at the entry checkpoint today they literally had workers out there
[02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:29.520]  constructing wooden frame to put up a bigger more extended veil preventing
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:34.080]  really any viewing of almost the entire perimeter of the hotel yesterday where
[02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:39.720]  you saw us filming the security cameras on tripods today was much more greatly
[02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:44.440]  restricted and then they were also seeing putting up the crime scene tape
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:50.080]  around the wooded area surrounding the hotel and a greater police presence
[02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:54.360]  further up the hill on the other side of the hotel as well Alex well it is a
[02:48:54.360 --> 02:49:01.600]  crime scene so the cops are doing their job yeah something like that but yeah it
[02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:06.320]  really shut things down for a while of course it was heavy rain today and this
[02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:12.480]  whole bomb scare you know it was just see-through Alex but it was their hoax to
[02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:18.320]  keep things under control or so they hope well Aaron we're going to continue to
[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:23.760]  report in the days to come as things unfold and obviously coming up and very
[02:49:23.760 --> 02:49:27.680]  soon now next week we're going to be able to go over even more that has
[02:49:27.680 --> 02:49:31.520]  developed and we'll learn more about the list and the full spectrum of what's
[02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:36.200]  happened in the demonstrations and the rest of it but any other points as we go
[02:49:36.200 --> 02:49:40.840]  to break here that you think are important to add Aaron well obviously on
[02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:47.000]  the economic front you know we have it in the avenue on back in 2009 obviously
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:51.520]  implying that they're ahead of this economic collapse but that it's a real
[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:55.480]  turning point it could lead to their total global control but it could also
[02:49:55.480 --> 02:50:02.720]  awaken Europeans to just be the hard-handed measures of bailing out
[02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:08.120]  these banks and employing austerity measures so he was obviously quite upset
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:12.920]  even three years ago at the possibility that it could awaken more people and it
[02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:17.200]  caused a greater outrage to their global controls of course they're trying to
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:23.080]  extend you know greater economic controls for the various global bodies
[02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:27.520]  but it nothing is set in stone and they themselves have admitted that it's quite
[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:31.200]  up in the air and obviously public opinion will play a factor into that
[02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:35.520]  worried about public feedback on all fronts it's a crossroads for free
[02:50:35.520 --> 02:50:39.720]  humanity and the global parasites because this is where they really set up
[02:50:39.720 --> 02:50:43.520]  their world government by bankrupting us than offering the alternative but if we
[02:50:43.520 --> 02:50:49.200]  stand now and expose them they will miscalculate and fail it is so important
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:53.200]  Aaron Dykes Paul Watson thank you so much for joining us I'm gonna come back

[02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:53.720]  Go in front of the globalists.
[02:54:53.720 --> 02:54:55.720]  You heard they didn't want to arrest that guy spray painting
[02:54:55.720 --> 02:54:58.720]  because they don't want to draw attention to it.
[02:54:58.720 --> 02:55:01.720]  I'm telling you, we got them by the, you know, what's here.
[02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:03.720]  This is very exciting.
[02:55:03.720 --> 02:55:07.720]  Lack of buyers may force Treasury to boost rates.
[02:55:07.720 --> 02:55:09.720]  That's the Washington Times.
[02:55:09.720 --> 02:55:11.720]  We've got all this other incredible news.
[02:55:11.720 --> 02:55:12.720]  Jobless claims rise.
[02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:14.720]  Trade gap narrows.
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:16.720]  Continuing here.
[02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:17.720]  I meant to get to this today.
[02:55:17.720 --> 02:55:20.720]  I'll try tomorrow because it's such big news.
[02:55:20.720 --> 02:55:22.720]  Because, you know, now we have Fox News reporting it.
[02:55:22.720 --> 02:55:25.720]  When I told you 10 years ago, that's that crazy Alex.
[02:55:25.720 --> 02:55:28.720]  China genetically modifying cows to produce human breast milk.
[02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:32.720]  Do you have any idea what happens when you cross different species together?
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:34.720]  This is so dangerous, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:34.720 --> 02:55:38.720]  And of course, the Department of Agriculture is funding rice, corn, other things
[02:55:38.720 --> 02:55:40.720]  that they feed to you that sterilizes you.
[02:55:40.720 --> 02:55:43.720]  Of course, it's already going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:49.720]  Continuing green buildings, hazardous to health, report sites, risk of weatherization.
[02:55:49.720 --> 02:55:55.720]  Everything they push, the little light bulbs that they're putting out are filled with mercury.
[02:55:55.720 --> 02:55:58.720]  The new Curly Q, little devil bulbs.
[02:55:58.720 --> 02:56:01.720]  Really good news on this front.
[02:56:01.720 --> 02:56:03.720]  Judges sharply challenge health care laws.
[02:56:03.720 --> 02:56:05.720]  Signals that they may completely overturn it.
[02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:08.720]  We've already had other courts partially overturn it.
[02:56:08.720 --> 02:56:11.720]  It should be overturned because of discrimination.
[02:56:11.720 --> 02:56:13.720]  Not just that it's unconstitutional.
[02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:18.720]  You can't give waivers to McDonald's and other Fortune 100 to not have to buy insurance for their employees
[02:56:18.720 --> 02:56:23.720]  and make you the hamburger placed next door by insurance.
[02:56:23.720 --> 02:56:25.720]  It's just incredible.
[02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:28.720]  But skeptical questions from three judges in Atlanta.
[02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:32.720]  Federal Appeals Court suggests that they may be ready to declare unconstitutional.
[02:56:32.720 --> 02:56:37.720]  All are part of the health care law promoted by Obama administration and passed last year.
[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:38.720]  But doesn't even matter.
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:41.720]  The bureaucracy is just doing it anyways.
[02:56:41.720 --> 02:56:44.720]  I mean, it's like Congress wouldn't pass the new carbon taxes.
[02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:47.720]  Obama's just putting them in, you know?
[02:56:47.720 --> 02:56:50.720]  I saw reports today that power plants are now having the new regulations go in
[02:56:50.720 --> 02:56:52.720]  and it's going to increase energy costs.
[02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:53.720]  I've got it in the stack.
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:56.720]  It's like $160 billion, I think is the headline of the year.
[02:56:56.720 --> 02:57:01.720]  And of course, that'll be passed on to you, the taxpayer and the person buying power,
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:04.720]  since they tried putting in the carbon taxes in Austin,
[02:57:04.720 --> 02:57:07.720]  which just means ripping us off and charging us more
[02:57:07.720 --> 02:57:11.720]  for this offshore power company that runs things here.
[02:57:11.720 --> 02:57:15.720]  In Austin, most people's things double the last two years.
[02:57:15.720 --> 02:57:18.720]  You like carbon taxes, you like them?
[02:57:18.720 --> 02:57:22.720]  Sending more money to these offshore pieces of trash?
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:24.720]  Man, there's another one.
[02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:27.720]  U.S. judges seem receptive to health care challenge.
[02:57:27.720 --> 02:57:31.720]  That's AP, health care overall fight in pivotal Atlanta court.
[02:57:31.720 --> 02:57:34.720]  Alabama's News 13 NBC.
[02:57:34.720 --> 02:57:38.720]  We can beat these people when we point out how ridiculously over the top
[02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:41.720]  all of this corruption is.
[02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:46.720]  Now continuing here today.
[02:57:46.720 --> 02:57:49.720]  We'll be back tomorrow live, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
[02:57:49.720 --> 02:57:51.720]  I've got to go get on a plane to New York,
[02:57:51.720 --> 02:57:55.720]  so to be the keynote speaker at Talkers Saturday.
[02:57:55.720 --> 02:58:01.720]  But in the third hour, we will have Watson and Aaron reporting live for us.
[02:58:01.720 --> 02:58:04.720]  They'll be hosting the show via cell phone from the Bilderberg site.
[02:58:04.720 --> 02:58:06.720]  They'll have a lot more intel.
[02:58:06.720 --> 02:58:09.720]  We're trying to get Tucker back on, trying to get Mark Anderson on.
[02:58:09.720 --> 02:58:13.720]  He's a great reporter from AmericanFreePros.net on here with us.
[02:58:13.720 --> 02:58:17.720]  We'll have more on the fall of Bilderbergs, the fall of their cover-up,
[02:58:17.720 --> 02:58:19.720]  the fall of their lies, the people strike back.
[02:58:19.720 --> 02:58:21.720]  Get that video out to everybody.
[02:58:21.720 --> 02:58:23.720]  It's on the Alex Jones channel at YouTube.
[02:58:23.720 --> 02:58:26.720]  Only you can make this thing get the millions of views it needs.
[02:58:26.720 --> 02:58:29.720]  It's a super turbo charge.
[02:58:29.720 --> 02:58:33.720]  People from all over Europe converging this Saturday at high noon.
[02:58:33.720 --> 02:58:36.720]  A lot of other news we didn't get to, like the new war they've started in Yemen.
[02:58:36.720 --> 02:58:39.720]  That's right, U.S. bombardment there, kinetic love action.
[02:58:39.720 --> 02:58:40.720]  God bless you all.
[02:58:40.720 --> 02:58:41.720]  Great job, crew.
[02:58:43.720 --> 02:58:44.720]  Thank you for listening to this video.
[02:58:44.720 --> 02:58:46.720]  Retransmission coming up with key intel.
[02:58:46.720 --> 02:59:07.720]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
