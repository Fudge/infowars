[00:00.000 --> 00:18.640]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:18.640 --> 00:26.800]  We are in the midst of two different counter-veiling revolutions, we have the pro-human, common-sense,
[00:26.800 --> 00:35.600]  purely liberal, Renaissance trajectory based on a Judeo-Christian ethos but integrated with
[00:35.600 --> 00:44.160]  modern science, then we have the globalist centralization paradigm that openly seeks
[00:44.160 --> 00:50.560]  to overthrow the natural order and program it in whatever shapes, sizes, and ways the
[00:50.560 --> 00:53.560]  new gods see fit.
[00:53.560 --> 00:59.600]  There is Renaissance and there is authoritarianism, authoritarianism sells its poison Kool-Aid
[00:59.600 --> 01:05.960]  in a thousand flavors but all of it will enslave you, all of it will destroy your dreams, all
[01:05.960 --> 01:13.440]  of it will lead you straight into hell and bondage.
[01:13.440 --> 01:19.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last month you've seen huge attack pieces in hundreds of newspapers
[01:19.560 --> 01:25.560]  national television, misrepresenting what I've said and what I've covered here on this
[01:25.560 --> 01:26.560]  broadcast.
[01:26.560 --> 01:34.200]  Okay, Alex Jones hates gay people, Alex Jones hates drag queens, listen, I'm a libertarian,
[01:34.200 --> 01:38.280]  I believe in conservative values for families because statistically that's successful and
[01:38.280 --> 01:41.480]  I believe people should be able to choose their sexuality and who they want to be and not
[01:41.480 --> 01:47.840]  be sexualized by a heterosexual uncle or a homosexual aunt or anybody, keep your hands
[01:47.840 --> 01:51.360]  off children, period.
[01:51.360 --> 01:58.200]  And the targeting of children by the Tavistock Institute, that's MI6 Mind Control publicly,
[01:58.200 --> 02:03.440]  that's public, British Mind Control operation, to have children as young as three sign up
[02:03.440 --> 02:10.160]  for gender reassignment, confusing them and Camille Paglia that has been a classical liberal
[02:10.160 --> 02:16.520]  lesbian says it's serious child abuse because it is.
[02:16.520 --> 02:22.800]  But then the media tries to hide behind their agenda of breaking up the family, dehumanization
[02:22.800 --> 02:28.560]  by chemicals, by cultural brainwashing, by anti-father figure images all throughout the
[02:28.560 --> 02:33.440]  media and all the other attacks, they want to change the subject whenever I expose the
[02:33.440 --> 02:37.560]  sexualization of children and say, oh, you're just against drag queens.
[02:37.560 --> 02:42.480]  No, I was against government programs in every European and Western country, including the
[02:42.480 --> 02:49.160]  US, sending two, three and four year olds to story time where men, sometimes dressed
[02:49.160 --> 02:54.640]  up like clowns, tell them want to be a drag queen, want to be a girl of your boy, want
[02:54.640 --> 03:01.480]  to be a girl of your boy or a boy of your girl, that is pure sexualization of children
[03:01.480 --> 03:05.600]  in the name of tolerance, targeting them.
[03:05.600 --> 03:14.360]  And there are major professors, major professors that are being banned from YouTube and banned
[03:14.360 --> 03:19.640]  from grants because they say there are male chromosomes, there are female chromosomes,
[03:19.640 --> 03:23.720]  there are males, there are females and that's the new ultimate crime.
[03:23.720 --> 03:28.640]  We were contacted by Facebook last week and told, you're going to be permanently banned
[03:28.640 --> 03:37.680]  if you don't stop talking about this, chemicals in the water, sexualization of children, they
[03:37.680 --> 03:44.120]  said, there's words you cannot say, you cannot say drag queen, you cannot say training and
[03:44.120 --> 03:51.960]  I'm like, that's weird until I realize they can use that term, they can push that agenda
[03:51.960 --> 03:59.000]  on kids, we can't even be allowed in the matrix to communicate the term to explain the agenda
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.480]  using the quote drag queens.
[04:03.480 --> 04:06.920]  Imagine if a woman came in and wanted to randomly talk to your children about sex, you'd say
[04:06.920 --> 04:11.440]  it was bizarre, it was a school nurse and they were too young, you'd think it was weird.
[04:11.440 --> 04:16.000]  What if it was a man, I mean if Judge Roy Moore was really court and 14 year olds, I
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.440]  think it's creepy, I don't like him, but it might not be true, he's denying it all.
[04:20.440 --> 04:27.200]  See what I mean, if Judge Roy Moore's 35 court and 14 year old girls, it's weird, but when
[04:27.200 --> 04:32.280]  you've got the footage that Millie Weaver and Gavin Winscott in Austin and a public
[04:32.280 --> 04:36.080]  thing, they were videotaping it, they streamed it online, took photos, all the kids, it's
[04:36.080 --> 04:42.960]  on infowars.com, the shock video, they have got men twerking and pole dancing with little
[04:42.960 --> 04:51.680]  kids and men wearing thong underwear with children dressed, I mean it is shocking sexualization
[04:51.680 --> 04:54.800]  of children, it is incredible and it's all coming up.
[04:54.800 --> 05:03.520]  If you go to infowarsstore.com and get game changing amazing products, we've been sold

[05:43.880 --> 05:48.720]  products from globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy, it is an act of war, it is
[05:48.720 --> 05:53.040]  an act of standing up when you spread the links, the articles and buy products from us and
[05:53.040 --> 05:56.040]  then we commit rampage against the enemy totally.
[05:56.040 --> 06:06.880]  We've got it, we've got it, thank you very much for coming to you.
[06:06.880 --> 06:22.480]  Raging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[06:22.480 --> 06:40.800]  the war, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the war, it's Alex
[06:40.800 --> 06:48.520]  Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the war, it's Alex Jones coming to you
[06:48.520 --> 06:56.300]  live from the front lines of the war, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[06:56.300 --> 06:57.300]  lines of the war.
[06:57.300 --> 06:59.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[06:59.680 --> 07:07.040]  We're going to premiere, if you can use that term, shocking footage, shot inside a quote
[07:07.040 --> 07:17.480]  drag queen festival held at a hotel in Austin Texas and if you think it's creepy when you
[07:17.480 --> 07:24.760]  see these fashion shows and little girls and little boys dressed up in adult clothing.
[07:24.760 --> 07:26.600]  I guess they think it's politically correct.
[07:26.600 --> 07:33.160]  It's okay to have young children next to men with huge cod pieces or scroll down and
[07:33.160 --> 07:38.760]  show them basically naked just with glitter on the man's genitals.
[07:38.760 --> 07:44.660]  Little girls, little boys, men humping the ground, twerking, children simulating it with
[07:44.660 --> 07:49.720]  women in a jibs just all trying to be counterculture.
[07:49.720 --> 07:57.240]  It can't get any weirder total sexualization of children.
[07:57.240 --> 08:10.720]  We're talking about women and men bringing their children to a drag queen festival that
[08:10.720 --> 08:20.280]  looks like a gay parade, which have your parades all day, but everybody's pointed out.
[08:20.280 --> 08:22.560]  It's something you don't bring your children to.
[08:22.560 --> 08:29.460]  So that's the next level, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:29.460 --> 08:37.640]  That's the next level of this coming up with Millie Weaver in studio at the bottom of the
[08:37.640 --> 08:38.640]  hour.
[08:38.640 --> 08:46.760]  And it is a total agenda all over the country and all over the western world, and it's weirder
[08:46.760 --> 08:52.480]  than hell because they will also at these events have Muslim Democratic Party leader
[08:52.480 --> 09:00.320]  women wearing hijabs who then have family members that are known jihadist that write
[09:00.320 --> 09:05.000]  books about not letting women go out without a man, don't let women drive cars and cut
[09:05.000 --> 09:10.960]  women's genitals off and throw gay people off buildings.
[09:10.960 --> 09:16.080]  So under the guise of tolerance, they're promoting the sexualization of children and we're going
[09:16.080 --> 09:19.000]  to premiere the footage and then we're going to post it.
[09:19.000 --> 09:28.040]  It's not posted yet at info wars dot com.
[09:28.040 --> 09:33.480]  Now we've got so much other over the top important news Saudi Arabia scramble fighter jets amid
[09:33.480 --> 09:41.120]  fears of war in the Middle East.
[09:41.120 --> 09:42.120]  That is escalating.
[09:42.120 --> 09:49.600]  Judge Roy Moore says he will sue the Washington Post and others over what he says are complete
[09:49.600 --> 09:50.600]  and total lies.
[09:50.600 --> 09:56.720]  Well, I don't know if Judge Roy Moore was trying to sexualize 14 year olds, but we got
[09:56.720 --> 10:03.760]  footage at events all over the world, including Austin, Texas this weekend, where it's men
[10:03.760 --> 10:08.800]  bent over humping like they're having sex with kids simulating it right next to them
[10:08.800 --> 10:18.320]  with women wearing hijabs clapping and then big old fat men with wigs on pole dancing.
[10:18.320 --> 10:25.000]  And little kids there just in the midst of clearly the early sexualization of children
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.360]  and the fetishizing of involving children in it.
[10:28.360 --> 10:34.600]  It is truly sick and our crew gets there and okay video tape.
[10:34.600 --> 10:37.000]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.800]  Yeah, we're streaming live on the Internet.
[10:40.800 --> 10:46.720]  Yeah, we've got Facebook showing it all and little kids giving tips, giving money to the
[10:46.720 --> 10:48.800]  drag queens that dance for them.
[10:48.800 --> 10:54.720]  In fact, I showed up the show up, ladies and gentlemen, we have video of fat men pole dancing
[10:54.720 --> 10:58.160]  and little kids, little girls and little boys giving them dollars.
[10:58.160 --> 11:02.960]  Imagine you go to the local park and there's a guy on the monkey bars in a woman's dress
[11:02.960 --> 11:07.800]  wearing a G string with his package with glitter on it, leaning over and then your children
[11:07.800 --> 11:10.600]  are giving them dollars.
[11:10.600 --> 11:15.960]  You would call the police, you would go and say no one would believe you.
[11:15.960 --> 11:20.740]  It would be so weird.
[11:20.740 --> 11:27.560]  No one would believe you, it would be so weird.
[11:27.560 --> 11:31.800]  Notice the left tried to destroy Ted Cruz because there's a Republican ones and there
[11:31.800 --> 11:37.040]  was some other Republican, they went to a burlesque show that was just women scantily
[11:37.040 --> 11:39.320]  dressed but covered up.
[11:39.320 --> 11:41.800]  Pretty classy in my view.
[11:41.800 --> 11:49.800]  Imagine if Ted Cruz went to one with transsexuals because we've been told Facebook officially
[11:49.800 --> 11:50.800]  said that's a hate word.
[11:50.800 --> 11:53.720]  Even though it was never thought to be a hate word before, we can't even use the word that
[11:53.720 --> 11:54.720]  they've banned.
[11:54.720 --> 11:58.760]  Again, it's all about the control of language so you can't even criticize something that's
[11:58.760 --> 12:11.280]  then attached itself to the overall larger agenda.
[12:11.280 --> 12:13.520]  Sparkle shine at story time.
[12:13.520 --> 12:22.360]  Saint Louis post dispatch.
[12:22.360 --> 12:27.320]  And then what it is is a bunch of little kids being rolled up in front of a bunch of men
[12:27.320 --> 12:32.720]  dressed like women scantily clad and being taught this is cool, this is fun, this is
[12:32.720 --> 12:33.720]  neat.
[12:33.720 --> 12:35.960]  That's just a newspaper article you brought in to show me.
[12:35.960 --> 12:46.400]  This is happening in every major city every week that children are being bombarded.
[12:46.400 --> 12:50.440]  And then people say, oh, you're just being mean.
[12:50.440 --> 12:54.440]  You're just attacking them because they're crossdressers.
[12:54.440 --> 12:57.120]  No ladies and gentlemen, I don't care about that.
[12:57.120 --> 13:01.680]  I don't care if they were heterosexuals, crossdressers, whatever they are, they shouldn't be in their
[13:01.680 --> 13:07.000]  bombarding in an organized program saying the drag queen goes swish, swish, swish, but you're
[13:07.000 --> 13:08.880]  all going to be drag queens when you grow up.
[13:08.880 --> 13:12.960]  You don't have a scientist or a firefighter or a police officer coming to say you're going
[13:12.960 --> 13:13.960]  to be that.
[13:13.960 --> 13:14.960]  No, no, no.
[13:14.960 --> 13:16.320]  We're going to teach you how to be a drag queen.
[13:16.320 --> 13:21.360]  I mean, it's on the audio from the AP piece and the media always plays dumb and says they
[13:21.360 --> 13:26.800]  don't want the alarm bell raised that we're making this up and just attacking drag queens.
[13:26.800 --> 13:31.840]  I mean, I will say these are hideously ugly men if they're going to be drag queens.
[13:31.840 --> 13:36.200]  My God, could they just get some that don't look like look like hell?
[13:36.200 --> 13:43.800]  I mean, I'm allowed to aesthetically say these are really obese people, but against the force
[13:43.800 --> 13:45.800]  feeding of it onto our children.
[13:45.800 --> 13:48.520]  So that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[13:48.520 --> 13:52.880]  But when we come back in a few minutes, every few months I see a stabbing attack at the
[13:52.880 --> 13:55.640]  Mall of America by a Somali.
[13:55.640 --> 13:59.840]  And then you always see the police chief say, we love our Somalis.
[13:59.840 --> 14:02.280]  We love our Muslims to oh, they're so good.
[14:02.280 --> 14:03.280]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[14:03.280 --> 14:07.440]  That was actually a quote I saw a few years ago and then they made a song out of it on
[14:07.440 --> 14:12.640]  super deluxe has been seen like 40 million times plus one of the most popular songs this
[14:12.640 --> 14:17.560]  year kind of blew up in their face and made folks love us not hate us.
[14:17.560 --> 14:21.920]  Well, there's been another stabbing at the Mall of America by Somali stabbed to people.
[14:21.920 --> 14:22.920]  They say for no reason.
[14:22.920 --> 14:27.160]  And we're going to come back and show you actual footage of the Mall of America what
[14:27.160 --> 14:35.120]  it looked like when the stabbing that this is this is during the stabbing this footage.
[14:35.120 --> 14:38.840]  And the mall is basically 90% Somali now.
[14:38.840 --> 14:43.120]  That is a government resettlement zone for 40 years.
[14:43.120 --> 14:47.680]  And then the Somalis do not on average assimilate.
[14:47.680 --> 14:56.560]  No, they just recreate Somalia right here.
[14:56.560 --> 15:00.360]  So we love our Somalis.
[15:00.360 --> 15:04.160]  We love our Muslims to oh, they're so good.
[15:04.160 --> 15:09.200]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[15:09.200 --> 15:12.800]  And it just shows where we've gone as a culture and a civilization briefly.
[15:12.800 --> 15:19.400]  We are having to end the specials that we had on a bunch of products because they basically
[15:19.400 --> 15:23.160]  sold out a bunch of products sold out.
[15:23.160 --> 15:27.160]  We're having to end the specials on Super Bowl Vitality and others, but we're extending
[15:27.160 --> 15:28.160]  free shipping.
[15:28.160 --> 15:32.080]  And we've added some new items only for two more days.

[18:28.720 --> 18:33.680]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,

[20:01.800 --> 20:17.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:17.600 --> 20:31.880]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[20:31.880 --> 20:37.320]  So if you're a radio listener, you probably know that we also simulcast via television
[20:37.320 --> 20:44.360]  on some cable systems and UHFVS, VHF stations, as well as streams on the internet so we can
[20:44.360 --> 20:48.120]  document what we're saying, not just make claims.
[20:48.120 --> 20:57.040]  That's why I pioneered, really about 19 years ago, simulcasting video with my radio show,
[20:57.040 --> 21:01.720]  not just a webcam, so I could show people news articles, show people documents, show
[21:01.720 --> 21:05.160]  people bills, show people legislation.
[21:05.160 --> 21:08.000]  That was really back in the day before the internet was so prolific where you could just
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.360]  go search any bill or find any piece of news you wanted, and then folks would just say
[21:12.360 --> 21:15.240]  I was making it up.
[21:15.240 --> 21:17.920]  So I began to show people, well that's what we do.
[21:17.920 --> 21:22.840]  But if you are a radio listener, if you go to infowars.com forward slash show, you can
[21:22.840 --> 21:25.600]  actually see what I'm talking about.
[21:25.600 --> 21:31.320]  Mall of America yesterday was about 95% Somali.
[21:31.320 --> 21:37.280]  Now that's the main area where they've been resettling for 40 plus years, the US government
[21:37.280 --> 21:43.960]  has been bringing Muslims in from the most suppressive, most radical Muslim nation in
[21:43.960 --> 21:50.240]  the world where women are sold at slave auctions to this day, and it has the highest murder
[21:50.240 --> 21:55.880]  rate in the world, and women are seen as basically animals.
[21:55.880 --> 22:04.600]  Now our government, as part of the diversity visa program, has colonized Minnesota with
[22:04.600 --> 22:11.680]  Somalis, and every few days I hear about a Somali stabbing someone or running over someone
[22:11.680 --> 22:13.640]  or shooting someone.
[22:13.640 --> 22:17.120]  Sometimes the police officers in Minnesota that are Somali just randomly shoot people.
[22:17.120 --> 22:19.240]  That's been the news.
[22:19.240 --> 22:23.840]  And it's I guess the culture you could say, everybody knows about Somalia and the pirates
[22:23.840 --> 22:25.920]  and all the rest of it, so this is being done.
[22:25.920 --> 22:32.720]  They're being brought into the country, and then every time there's a new attack, it just
[22:32.720 --> 22:37.680]  gets shuffled under the rug.
[22:37.680 --> 22:38.680]  What's really going on?
[22:38.680 --> 22:43.760]  But here's the attack.
[22:43.760 --> 22:47.760]  Suspect arrested after stabbing at Mall of America.
[22:47.760 --> 22:52.040]  And then Time Magazine, Newsweek, and others have headlines, oh look, Somalis finding their
[22:52.040 --> 23:00.720]  way in America, and it shows them at the swimming pool wearing their hijabs, their full, full
[23:00.720 --> 23:04.080]  outfits in the pool.
[23:04.080 --> 23:06.800]  And then again, this isn't backwards, this isn't suppressive of women.
[23:06.800 --> 23:10.920]  No, no, the left says this is good.
[23:10.920 --> 23:15.120]  This is great.
[23:15.120 --> 23:19.680]  And then if you go to a drag queen festival, you'll see five-year-old kids holding hands
[23:19.680 --> 23:25.640]  with men who wearing nothing but glitter glued to their genitals.
[23:25.640 --> 23:30.040]  But see now a little girl, a little boy, with a man with glitter on his genitals, it's okay
[23:30.040 --> 23:31.920]  because it's liberal.
[23:31.920 --> 23:33.800]  It's not sexualization of children.
[23:33.800 --> 23:34.800]  It's not conditioning everybody.
[23:34.800 --> 23:37.280]  It's not an organized program, which it is.
[23:37.280 --> 23:39.200]  It's just peace and love.
[23:39.200 --> 23:44.320]  And then at the very event, we got videotape of this weekend in Austin, there are women
[23:44.320 --> 23:50.680]  in hijabs there clapping, yay.
[23:50.680 --> 23:57.960]  This is the weirdness that the globalists have engineered, where they love an authoritarian,
[23:57.960 --> 24:03.600]  anti-homosexual religion.
[24:03.600 --> 24:08.520]  And then they integrated in with women in hijabs that are suppressed and controlled at these
[24:08.520 --> 24:13.480]  bizarre events.
[24:13.480 --> 24:16.600]  And it's just what Matt Bracken talks about, where the Islamists will show up suddenly
[24:16.600 --> 24:17.600]  in mass.
[24:17.600 --> 24:19.680]  The first wave, they adopt your culture.
[24:19.680 --> 24:24.080]  The second wave, suddenly they come out in mass as part of Islam to condition you and
[24:24.080 --> 24:25.080]  to teach you.
[24:25.080 --> 24:29.080]  Let's roll that footage for TV viewers of what was happening in Minnesota.
[24:29.080 --> 24:30.760]  This is the Mall of America.
[24:30.760 --> 24:36.520]  This is yesterday, the same day that there's the stabbing.
[24:36.520 --> 24:43.200]  And this is what's happening, and the camera goes on and on and on, so you can see your
[24:43.200 --> 24:50.920]  new Somali majority, and then the other folks, they're not white, they're just Arabs.
[24:50.920 --> 24:58.960]  So the Arabs are the minority at the Mall of America, and the black Northeast Africans,
[24:58.960 --> 25:02.240]  where slavery is still legal.
[25:02.240 --> 25:10.800]  And then here is our new Somali god, Mahad Adredam 20, his accused of stabbing two people
[25:10.800 --> 25:11.800]  to Mall of America.
[25:11.800 --> 25:19.440]  And there he is, suspect arrested after stabbing at Mall of America, 20-year-old suspect.
[25:19.440 --> 25:23.040]  Flemington Police said the incident happened Sunday evening in the first floor dressing
[25:23.040 --> 25:24.040]  room.
[25:24.040 --> 25:25.520]  It was on to say that people didn't do anything.
[25:25.520 --> 25:30.040]  On the surveillance camera, he just walks over and starts stabbing them.
[25:30.040 --> 25:35.520]  Police said the first victim was stabbed after he returned to the dressing room and confronted
[25:35.520 --> 25:44.560]  Mahad Ababa, whatever his name is, Minneapolis, who had allegedly attempted to steal his belongings.
[25:44.560 --> 25:50.520]  Oh, a 20-year-old suspect is in custody after two men were stabbed at the Mall of America
[25:50.520 --> 25:55.280]  in Minnesota during what police called an interrupted theft.
[25:55.280 --> 26:01.560]  The incident occurred inside the Macy's store.
[26:01.560 --> 26:08.440]  And so you see, that's the culture now, ladies and gentlemen, robbing, stealing, pirating.
[26:08.440 --> 26:12.040]  What is the main culture of Somalia?
[26:12.040 --> 26:14.840]  Stealing and bandoning.
[26:14.840 --> 26:16.560]  All their neighbors hate them.
[26:16.560 --> 26:18.520]  Sudan won't let them in.
[26:18.520 --> 26:19.880]  Kenya won't let them in.
[26:19.880 --> 26:23.520]  And those are black people that won't let Somalis into their country.
[26:23.520 --> 26:29.920]  Do you know how many people Saudi Arabia allows in from Somalia to come their refugees?
[26:29.920 --> 26:40.080]  Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[26:40.080 --> 26:46.760]  Oh, but here, ladies and gentlemen, let's just go to the mall and it's 90-something
[26:46.760 --> 26:51.440]  percent Somalis, and then you catch somebody robbing you, and boy, you're going to get
[26:51.440 --> 26:56.560]  stabbed, someone else is going to get stabbed.
[26:56.560 --> 27:00.680]  Can we go out to break with just the last 40 seconds of the song that, again, has been
[27:00.680 --> 27:02.720]  seen over 40 million times?
[27:02.720 --> 27:11.240]  The Alex Jones Bon Iver piece, so that everybody can just understand and just know what we're
[27:11.240 --> 27:13.640]  dealing with here and how serious this is.
[27:13.640 --> 27:15.160]  I'm not making a joke out of it.
[27:15.160 --> 27:16.160]  It's very, very sad.
[27:16.160 --> 27:17.160]  They made a joke out of it.
[27:17.160 --> 27:18.160]  It's Super Deluxe.
[27:18.160 --> 27:19.160]  Time Warner did.
[27:19.160 --> 27:24.040]  They took the video and made a joke about it, but now it's become a national anthem against
[27:24.040 --> 27:25.040]  this insanity.
[27:25.040 --> 27:26.280]  They're force-feeding us.
[27:26.280 --> 27:28.560]  The cultural death, they're force-feeding us.
[27:28.560 --> 27:35.600]  But again, briefly, we are going to end free shipping tomorrow.
[27:35.600 --> 27:39.920]  The specials we have for the last four days are gone because a lot of those items were
[27:39.920 --> 27:48.160]  about to sell out like Super Male Vitality and Super Female Vitality, but the probiotic
[27:48.160 --> 27:53.360]  bomb defense about to sell out, but still 50 percent off.
[27:53.360 --> 27:58.520]  Silver blue, colloidal, silver, fluoride-free, mouthwash, 50 percent off, vitamin mineral
[27:58.520 --> 27:59.880]  fusion, and silver 50 percent off.
[27:59.880 --> 28:03.680]  But we've added Caveman True Paleo formula.
[28:03.680 --> 28:06.320]  It's so amazing that people love so much.
[28:06.320 --> 28:08.800]  That's 50 percent off as well.
[28:08.800 --> 28:09.800]  Free shipping.
[28:09.800 --> 28:10.800]  It's got to end.
[28:10.800 --> 28:14.840]  ZShield is also being added for the things that have gotten taken off the list, the amazing
[28:14.840 --> 28:16.480]  heavy metal detoxifier.
[28:16.480 --> 28:26.160]  Check it all out for yourself, infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[28:26.160 --> 28:34.840]  But when we come back, we are going to air the piece that Gavin Wentz and Millie Weaver
[28:34.840 --> 28:45.920]  shot inside the bizarro world, and that's putting it lightly, of men dressed as women,
[28:45.920 --> 28:51.520]  having children give them tips for twerking their butts in the children's faces.
[28:51.520 --> 28:53.840]  But it's okay because it's liberal.
[28:53.840 --> 28:55.520]  It's not sexualizing children.
[28:55.520 --> 28:57.520]  It's a wonderful thing.
[28:57.520 --> 28:58.640]  Hey, Daniel Brieman.
[28:58.640 --> 29:00.960]  Why new manna, storeable foods?
[29:00.960 --> 29:02.600]  We believe in freedom.
[29:02.600 --> 29:07.400]  We need strong independent families to endure what's ahead, and we take this charge seriously.
[29:07.400 --> 29:08.400]  We got options.
[29:08.400 --> 29:09.400]  Organic.
[29:09.400 --> 29:10.400]  No gluten.
[29:10.400 --> 29:11.400]  Without the chemicals.
[29:11.400 --> 29:12.400]  Great taste and value.
[29:12.400 --> 29:17.080]  New Manna is a no-lose investment for your family's food independence.

[29:27.520 --> 29:30.120]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[29:30.120 --> 29:31.120]  That's true.
[29:31.120 --> 29:36.120]  Did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still alive?
[29:36.120 --> 29:39.720]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty
[29:39.720 --> 29:41.280]  and guarantees.
[29:41.280 --> 29:45.600]  No stock market risk, no tax risk, and no penalties.
[29:45.600 --> 29:49.440]  Call life benefits if you'd like a free book about how this can be done.
[29:49.440 --> 29:52.960]  Call 702-660-7000.
[29:52.960 --> 29:59.320]  That's 702-660-7000.
[29:59.320 --> 30:02.560]  America is an information-based civil war.
[30:02.560 --> 30:06.280]  That's why now, more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these
[30:06.280 --> 30:09.960]  globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bullies.
[30:09.960 --> 30:16.320]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[30:16.320 --> 30:22.320]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly
[30:22.320 --> 30:23.320]  the counterculture.
[30:23.320 --> 30:30.040]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom,
[30:30.040 --> 30:32.800]  who at the same time is tolerant.
[30:32.800 --> 30:37.600]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Geverson's classical liberalism.
[30:37.600 --> 30:42.960]  They are the anti-liberalists who defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote
[30:42.960 --> 30:43.960]  freedom worldwide.
[30:43.960 --> 30:49.480]  We've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as
[30:49.480 --> 30:53.120]  well as more Patriot Feral at infowarstore.com.
[30:53.120 --> 30:58.080]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at infowarstore.com.
[30:58.080 --> 31:04.420]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[31:04.420 --> 31:10.800]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[31:10.800 --> 31:18.040]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[31:18.040 --> 31:22.960]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer, and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[31:22.960 --> 31:23.960]  at infowarstore.com.
[31:23.960 --> 31:27.640]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[31:27.640 --> 31:31.480]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[31:31.480 --> 31:33.920]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[31:33.920 --> 31:38.000]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver
[31:38.000 --> 31:45.840]  and iodine as well, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139, and your purchase of the products stands
[31:45.840 --> 31:49.400]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
[31:49.400 --> 31:51.040]  satanic pedophile armies.
[31:51.040 --> 31:54.160]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back
[31:54.160 --> 32:02.000]  against us, so we need your support.
[32:02.000 --> 32:06.240]  We're running the biggest specials, we've run them like six months, and free shipping,
[32:06.240 --> 32:10.720]  store-wide at infowarstore.com, and when we sell products at this lower price, we've
[32:10.720 --> 32:14.480]  got to sell a lot of it to fund the operation, but I know the products are so good that
[32:14.480 --> 32:17.680]  even though we make a very small profit on each item, you'll like them, and then order
[32:17.680 --> 32:22.920]  more, especially things like the coffee that's so good, or our toothpaste, or our mouthwash,
[32:22.920 --> 32:28.920]  or our vitamin mineral fusion, fruit punch drink, got all the amino acids and multivitamins,
[32:28.920 --> 32:34.560]  our probiotic, all of it, super mill vitality, 50% off, never done that, and free shipping,
[32:34.560 --> 32:35.560]  boom.
[32:35.560 --> 32:40.240]  Super filmable vitality, 50% off, with free shipping, boom, bomb defense, 50% off, with
[32:40.240 --> 32:41.240]  free shipping.
[32:41.240 --> 32:43.440]  With the free shipping folks, it's a lost leader.
[32:43.440 --> 32:46.960]  To sign up for auto-ship, we're losing like six, seven dollars on this.
[32:46.960 --> 32:48.960]  That matter, I just want you to see how great it is.
[32:48.960 --> 32:53.680]  We are now four and a half hours into the worldwide broadcast, America Rebirth, and Renaissance
[32:53.680 --> 33:00.880]  was so much coming up today.
[33:00.880 --> 33:22.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.840 --> 33:39.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:39.000 --> 33:43.800]  All right, if you're radio listeners, we're going to voice over some of this play by play,
[33:43.800 --> 33:48.760]  but for TV viewers, viewer discretion is advised.
[33:48.760 --> 33:55.200]  This is really disturbing footage that Millie Weaver and Gavin Wentz shot at the International
[33:55.200 --> 34:01.320]  Drag Queen Festival here in Austin, Texas this weekend.
[34:01.320 --> 34:04.680]  I want to be clear, the media, every time we cover this stuff, misrepresents that we
[34:04.680 --> 34:06.720]  hate gay people are drag queens.
[34:06.720 --> 34:08.160]  That is not what's happening.
[34:08.160 --> 34:13.760]  I don't care if it's a bunch of heterosexuals, you know, saying, in their torquing for children
[34:13.760 --> 34:16.240]  or homosexuals or whatever.
[34:16.240 --> 34:20.600]  The point is that this is serious sexualization of children.
[34:20.600 --> 34:24.360]  Some of the people there may not get that or understand it, but you've got men torquing
[34:24.360 --> 34:27.720]  for children that give them tips, totally inappropriate.
[34:27.720 --> 34:34.360]  You've got men totally naked except for glitter on their genitalia with little boys and little
[34:34.360 --> 34:35.360]  girls.
[34:35.360 --> 34:36.360]  Scroll down and show TV viewers.
[34:36.360 --> 34:38.880]  Folks, I mean, that's just glitter.
[34:38.880 --> 34:42.280]  Some of the footage was so shocking, you didn't show it, though they have their own YouTube
[34:42.280 --> 34:43.960]  channels and stream this live.
[34:43.960 --> 34:47.880]  They were proud of this, so this is sexualization of children.
[34:47.880 --> 34:55.200]  If you saw a man at the park that was on a jungle gym naked, if you saw a man at the
[34:55.200 --> 35:00.560]  park who had glitter on his genitalia with a wig on and kids giving them dollars, you'd
[35:00.560 --> 35:04.200]  think you were in the twilight zone and called the police.
[35:04.200 --> 35:05.200]  This is crazy.
[35:05.200 --> 35:09.960]  Out of the guys of art and under the guys of tolerance, this is happening all over the
[35:09.960 --> 35:10.960]  western world.
[35:10.960 --> 35:13.040]  It's not just that drag queens go into story time.
[35:13.040 --> 35:15.280]  They go, you're going to be a drag queen, aren't you?
[35:15.280 --> 35:16.280]  Swish, swish, swish.
[35:16.280 --> 35:17.720]  Oh, thank you.
[35:17.720 --> 35:23.560]  And then now it's gone to men on their knees simulating sex with little kids running up,
[35:23.560 --> 35:25.000]  simulating it and giving them money.
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.360]  Millie Weaver, what gave you and Gavin the idea to go do this and what did you think
[35:28.360 --> 35:29.360]  once you got there?
[35:29.360 --> 35:31.160]  Because I've never seen anything this extreme.
[35:31.160 --> 35:37.040]  Well, we've seen already how there have been children drag queens already coming out in
[35:37.040 --> 35:40.880]  the media, which the LGBTQ community has been promoting.
[35:40.880 --> 35:46.680]  So when we looked into the Austin International Drag Festival, we saw their headliners.
[35:46.680 --> 35:50.960]  And in their headliners, they had a young boy dressed in drag.
[35:50.960 --> 35:51.960]  That's right.
[35:51.960 --> 35:52.960]  You heard me.
[35:52.960 --> 35:53.960]  Dressed in drag.
[35:53.960 --> 35:57.680]  And he was one of the performers alongside performers that had the most raunchy, disgusting
[35:57.680 --> 36:00.040]  names you could ever imagine.
[36:00.040 --> 36:03.400]  So we knew that this was going to be something that was going to be inappropriate.
[36:03.400 --> 36:05.640]  It said, all ages welcome.
[36:05.640 --> 36:06.640]  Children are welcome.
[36:06.640 --> 36:13.480]  The parents brought their children to this show and they were cursing their names were
[36:13.480 --> 36:14.480]  raunchy.
[36:14.480 --> 36:17.560]  I don't even know if it's radio friendly to say some of their names.
[36:17.560 --> 36:20.320]  And it was just completely inappropriate.
[36:20.320 --> 36:25.760]  Now it would be funny if it were just all adults, maybe drinking cocktails and laughing.
[36:25.760 --> 36:30.160]  Oh, it's funny, you know, but that's when you have an adult audience, not when you have
[36:30.160 --> 36:31.320]  children there.
[36:31.320 --> 36:32.320]  And that's the whole problem.
[36:32.320 --> 36:36.920]  You don't take your daughters or your sons when they're three or four years old to a
[36:36.920 --> 36:37.920]  strip bar.
[36:37.920 --> 36:38.920]  Exactly.
[36:38.920 --> 36:39.920]  You don't, you don't do that.
[36:39.920 --> 36:41.920]  And the point is they know what they're doing.
[36:41.920 --> 36:46.520]  The groups, the organizations you're talking about, the symbols that were there, everything
[36:46.520 --> 36:47.520]  going on.
[36:47.520 --> 36:50.720]  This is the, this is creepville to the max.
[36:50.720 --> 36:54.360]  We're going to come back after break after we played this and analyze it more.
[36:54.360 --> 36:58.320]  But on infowars.com, the video has gone live.
[36:58.320 --> 37:00.160]  It's on Twitter at real Alex Jones.
[37:00.160 --> 37:02.560]  It's on Facebook.
[37:02.560 --> 37:04.600]  These are people that wanted the media here.
[37:04.600 --> 37:06.400]  They wanted to show you this.
[37:06.400 --> 37:08.040]  They wanted you to see this.
[37:08.040 --> 37:13.080]  They wanted to see men, obese men, acting like strippers with young children, giving
[37:13.080 --> 37:14.080]  them money.
[37:14.080 --> 37:16.360]  This is what they wanted you to see.
[37:16.360 --> 37:25.080]  So now we're going to show you the, the, the, the true in your face coming out of this underculture
[37:25.080 --> 37:29.280]  that people talk about the creepiness of the, of the fashion shows, the little boys and
[37:29.280 --> 37:33.080]  little girls dress a little scantily, okay, or dress like adults.
[37:33.080 --> 37:35.200]  This is 50 levels more.
[37:35.200 --> 37:36.200]  This is.
[37:36.200 --> 37:37.200]  Yes.
[37:37.200 --> 37:39.760]  And you know, some of the drag queens that were participating talked about and bragged
[37:39.760 --> 37:43.520]  about how they do the story time with drag queens.
[37:43.520 --> 37:48.280]  So they are the same drag queens that do the story time readings at these libraries with
[37:48.280 --> 37:49.280]  children.
[37:49.280 --> 37:52.840]  And they were bragging about that saying, oh, family programming, ha, ha, ha.
[37:52.840 --> 37:57.120]  And they even said in the future, all of your children will be dressing like this.
[37:57.120 --> 38:01.400]  And that was kind of the theme that they wanted to promote, that this is the future.
[38:01.400 --> 38:04.480]  And a lot of leftists don't want paramilitary groups in the schools, training kids like
[38:04.480 --> 38:08.720]  ROTC to wear uniforms, because it is a feeder group into the military.
[38:08.720 --> 38:11.440]  We have to decide whether you want your children in those programs at the school or not.
[38:11.440 --> 38:16.920]  This is force fed to entire assemblies to confuse the gender run by the Tabistock Institute
[38:16.920 --> 38:20.560]  out of England that is their MI6 Mind Control Bureau.
[38:20.560 --> 38:22.600]  I mean, look at this one shot right here.
[38:22.600 --> 38:23.600]  Scroll down please.
[38:23.600 --> 38:31.360]  This is a man with his genitals covered and with a boy dressed as a girl.
[38:31.360 --> 38:38.560]  I mean, this is unbelievable and we all know what it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[38:38.560 --> 38:42.040]  We all know exactly what it is.
[38:42.040 --> 38:46.920]  This is the exact same type of art and crap getting promoted by Tony Podesta, the brother
[38:46.920 --> 38:50.400]  of John Podesta, who just had his big lobbying firm shut down.
[38:50.400 --> 38:51.400]  Milly?
[38:51.400 --> 38:55.440]  You know, what's interesting also to know is that the young drag queen boy that was
[38:55.440 --> 38:59.800]  there, his mothers were there alongside him.
[38:59.800 --> 39:03.200]  And it just goes to show that this is what happens.
[39:03.200 --> 39:04.800]  This is the culture.
[39:04.800 --> 39:07.280]  And these children are being overly sexualized.
[39:07.280 --> 39:08.280]  Now, if growing into this-
[39:08.280 --> 39:10.080]  Camille Pagley has called it sexual abuse.
[39:10.080 --> 39:11.320]  She's a liberal lesbian.
[39:11.320 --> 39:12.320]  It is.
[39:12.320 --> 39:15.000]  You start trying to tell three, four, five, six-year-olds that there's something else
[39:15.000 --> 39:20.040]  and trying to put it in their head and then take them to things that give fat men pole
[39:20.040 --> 39:23.280]  dancing money, shaking their butts in the kids' faces.
[39:23.280 --> 39:24.280]  This is sick.
[39:24.280 --> 39:25.560]  It is disgusting.
[39:25.560 --> 39:27.840]  You had people there dressed inappropriately.
[39:27.840 --> 39:31.680]  I could never even imagine as a woman wearing what these drag queens were wearing.
[39:31.680 --> 39:36.800]  You had somebody come out with just like a clear, like, mesh-looking top that had just
[39:36.800 --> 39:41.160]  black-taped X's over the nipples, giving the children hugs.
[39:41.160 --> 39:43.440]  It was just really disturbing.
[39:43.440 --> 39:44.800]  I couldn't even imagine.
[39:44.800 --> 39:49.720]  I was sitting there trying to be like, okay, how are we going to talk about this without
[39:49.720 --> 39:51.880]  it just being completely disturbing to people?
[39:51.880 --> 39:56.040]  This is total conditioning and I guarantee you research the headliners and their names.
[39:56.040 --> 39:57.840]  You know what you're going to find at the bottom of it.
[39:57.840 --> 40:02.840]  I mean, this is full-grown men dressed as women seductively dancing for little girls
[40:02.840 --> 40:04.920]  and boys being given money by them.
[40:04.920 --> 40:07.880]  Again, if you saw this driving by the park, what would you do?
[40:07.880 --> 40:10.640]  You'd think an alternate dimension of hell had opened.
[40:10.640 --> 40:12.360]  And here's the other part here.
[40:12.360 --> 40:13.760]  Here's the other element.
[40:13.760 --> 40:18.840]  The drag queens attracted an audience of what I like to call it, what I thought looked
[40:18.840 --> 40:21.240]  like, in my opinion, John's.
[40:21.240 --> 40:26.040]  You had a bunch of regular-looking dudes there that were totally perving on the drag queens,
[40:26.040 --> 40:30.080]  winking at them, giving them money, giving them kisses on the way he grabbed them.
[40:30.080 --> 40:31.080]  Oh, yeah.
[40:31.080 --> 40:32.080]  I mean, it's like, look, look, look, look.
[40:32.080 --> 40:33.600]  I've not been to topless bars in years and years, but I've been to them.
[40:33.600 --> 40:36.120]  You see how the guy goes up and gives them money and how the guys are looking.
[40:36.120 --> 40:40.320]  I mean, it is an incredible scene of a bunch of men with a bunch of little kids dancing
[40:40.320 --> 40:44.000]  around, scannily clad, with a bunch of men scannily clad dancing around.
[40:44.000 --> 40:51.120]  And some men with, with, with no clothes on, but glitter on their genitals with children.
[40:51.120 --> 40:52.120]  You had some.
[40:52.120 --> 40:56.200]  I mean, basically naked men with children and watch the media is either going to totally
[40:56.200 --> 40:59.000]  ignore this or turn it around.
[40:59.000 --> 41:00.000]  Exactly.
[41:00.000 --> 41:05.120]  And you had at the Huffington Post and Buzzfeed and places and salon that promotes pedophilia.
[41:05.120 --> 41:08.400]  What are you doing signing on to all this and covering it up?
[41:08.400 --> 41:10.000]  What is wrong with you people?
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  This isn't tolerance.
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.000]  This is sick.
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  It's going to bite you all in the butt.
[41:14.000 --> 41:19.400]  You watch the LGBTQ community needs to denounce this behavior.
[41:19.400 --> 41:25.440]  They need to stop putting children in this environment and exposing them to mature content
[41:25.440 --> 41:27.360]  because this is what's going to happen.
[41:27.360 --> 41:31.400]  It's going to actually make it so that people say, well, I guess all of it's being abused.
[41:31.400 --> 41:36.400]  Let's throw it all out when in reality it's essentially like bringing kids to a mock
[41:36.400 --> 41:40.920]  strip club performance event where you have them all dressed in clothing, but removing
[41:40.920 --> 41:47.240]  some articles of clothing alongside one step away, it all had the feeling of a swingers
[41:47.240 --> 41:48.240]  club.
[41:48.240 --> 41:49.240]  Oh yeah.
[41:49.240 --> 41:50.240]  Okay.
[41:50.240 --> 41:52.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's just stop right there.
[41:52.040 --> 41:55.760]  We're going to go to break, come back with a footage that I don't even want to play.
[41:55.760 --> 41:58.920]  And again, Millie, I think you should put out the stuff that you said you guys didn't
[41:58.920 --> 41:59.920]  put out.
[41:59.920 --> 42:04.320]  I think we need to put out the most hardcore because people just have a right to see this.
[42:04.320 --> 42:05.520]  They need to know.
[42:05.520 --> 42:17.160]  But men with nothing on, but flex of glass, glitter on their genitals, posing with children.
[42:17.160 --> 42:26.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, this is the gay pride parade on PCP with your
[42:26.360 --> 42:30.640]  children in the middle of it and people saying, be taller, be nice, don't restrict us, don't
[42:30.640 --> 42:36.880]  restrict us, and it's just the most wanton grab that children's innocence I've ever
[42:36.880 --> 42:37.880]  seen.
[42:37.880 --> 42:42.920]  Because I guess they've probed with the drag dream things we've got from AP, telling kids
[42:42.920 --> 42:46.320]  you're going to be drag queens and you know, guys shaking their butts in their faces there
[42:46.320 --> 42:48.840]  to the next level.
[42:48.840 --> 42:52.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, then it becomes a protected group that you can't criticize because of
[42:52.680 --> 42:55.080]  their group, any of their activities.
[42:55.080 --> 43:01.600]  This is the Facebook plan, you go to infowarstore.com and get game changing, amazing products.

[46:57.800 --> 47:11.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:11.520 --> 47:14.200]  Waging war on corruption.
[47:14.200 --> 47:20.440]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[47:20.440 --> 47:25.320]  So, we know Hollywood, we know Nambler, we know all these groups have an agenda to break
[47:25.320 --> 47:29.680]  up the family and to sexualize children and we know how they run their operations through
[47:29.680 --> 47:34.440]  the United Nations and other groups and so all over the country and all over the world
[47:34.440 --> 47:38.160]  they have these drag queen days, schools, you think oh okay it's a drag queen coming
[47:38.160 --> 47:41.600]  to read the kids and they tell them I'm a man dressed as a woman, I'm a drag queen,
[47:41.600 --> 47:43.600]  you could be one too.
[47:43.600 --> 47:47.640]  I mean imagine if just a random guy showed up and said like Judge Roy Moore, I'm here,
[47:47.640 --> 47:52.600]  you're five years old and I just want to know someday you might want to date me little honey.
[47:52.600 --> 47:56.280]  You'd say that was grooming and totally sick but because the left doesn't and the media
[47:56.280 --> 47:58.320]  backs it up they go along with it.
[47:58.320 --> 48:02.640]  Now Milly we're not going to say these names on there, some of them you can but even for
[48:02.640 --> 48:06.440]  family friendly we can say some of the names as the FCC on our radio stations but I don't
[48:06.440 --> 48:07.440]  want to.
[48:07.440 --> 48:12.280]  Some we can't but you pointed out during the break it was about debasing women and there
[48:12.280 --> 48:14.360]  was also a lot of Satanism overtones.
[48:14.360 --> 48:16.920]  Of course, repeat what you said during the break.
[48:16.920 --> 48:23.600]  You know, believe it or not watching their performances I began to feel somewhat insulted.
[48:23.600 --> 48:28.560]  I know that sounds bizarre but I was like, so you're going to say that you're a woman
[48:28.560 --> 48:33.400]  and then you're going to prance around in the most derogatory sense disrespecting women.
[48:33.400 --> 48:40.040]  They had women or drag queens dressed like cleaning ladies like you know, Ron P.
[48:40.040 --> 48:45.520]  That's the whole point, to base children, to base men, to base women, isn't funny, you're
[48:45.520 --> 48:46.520]  absolutely right.
[48:46.520 --> 48:50.800]  So tell people the names of what they call women and if anybody else did it they would
[48:50.800 --> 48:53.320]  say was to debase women.
[48:53.320 --> 48:54.680]  Tell people the names.
[48:54.680 --> 49:00.280]  So one of the names was Muffy Fishbasket, another was Eaton Johnson, I mean the names
[49:00.280 --> 49:03.960]  were just completely raunchy and debased and they announced it to the kids, they go it's
[49:03.960 --> 49:10.200]  Eaton Johnson, it's Rotten Fishbasket, but again the names were all about rotting stinking
[49:10.200 --> 49:13.920]  women, get into that, which is debasing women, this is so sick.
[49:13.920 --> 49:19.880]  The names were completely just horrible and the whole theme was kind of disrespectful
[49:19.880 --> 49:20.880]  towards women.
[49:20.880 --> 49:21.880]  I mean imagine-
[49:21.880 --> 49:26.080]  That's what it is, the whole thing is about becoming the women and then pulling down the
[49:26.080 --> 49:27.080]  women.
[49:27.080 --> 49:29.920]  The whole thing, the whole globalist program is aimed at women, that's in the declassified
[49:29.920 --> 49:30.920]  documents.
[49:30.920 --> 49:36.600]  Well imagine if somebody said they identified as a different racial group and in depicting
[49:36.600 --> 49:37.600]  women-
[49:37.600 --> 49:41.160]  Imagine if I put blackface on and then ran around simulating robbing people and killing
[49:41.160 --> 49:44.760]  people, which would be totally racist and evil and stereotypical exactly.
[49:44.760 --> 49:48.280]  But it's okay, the left can do it, they can sexualize children, they can do racial stuff,
[49:48.280 --> 49:52.360]  they can tell the nastiest jokes you've ever heard as long as you're not white.
[49:52.360 --> 49:56.680]  And if these drag queens are saying oh we're women, we're depicting women, what is that
[49:56.680 --> 49:58.680]  telling little girls to be like?
[49:58.680 --> 50:02.640]  Should they be role models for little girls saying this is what they should behave like?
[50:02.640 --> 50:06.560]  I've decided to fight on this subject, we were told by Facebook last week and we did
[50:06.560 --> 50:09.240]  record it and we told them we recorded it, they actually have one of their high level
[50:09.240 --> 50:13.200]  folks call us and say we're going to start running stuff by you and if you don't do what
[50:13.200 --> 50:16.560]  we say and take stuff down yourself, we're banning you.
[50:16.560 --> 50:19.960]  Well hey, Huckleberry, throw me in that briar patch.
[50:19.960 --> 50:22.840]  And I know what they're going to do with this because the one thing they said you will not
[50:22.840 --> 50:27.160]  criticize drag queens, you will not say the word tranny, and I said I looked up that word,
[50:27.160 --> 50:31.520]  it wasn't derogatory until 2017 when Facebook said it was.
[50:31.520 --> 50:36.720]  So they're not even controlling language, I don't even dislike, you know, I mean I'm
[50:36.720 --> 50:41.280]  sure there are a lot of people that are like that into that who aren't going after kids.
[50:41.280 --> 50:43.960]  And there are a lot of folks that, you know, like Camille Paglia, who's a lesbian, saying
[50:43.960 --> 50:47.960]  this is child abuse, what's happening, it's an evil agenda, the sexualization, the confusing
[50:47.960 --> 50:51.320]  agendas, it's a targeted program, it's admitted.
[50:51.320 --> 50:57.280]  But that said, they can't hide behind the whole LGBT thing and do things like this.
[50:57.280 --> 51:02.480]  I mean imagine if a group of men put on parties where they dance naked in front of your kids
[51:02.480 --> 51:07.440]  or scantily clad and your children gave them money, that's called pedophilia, that's called
[51:07.440 --> 51:08.440]  pervert land.
[51:08.440 --> 51:13.320]  Well, it was happening, but because it was a public festival, it hid and blamed you.
[51:13.320 --> 51:17.760]  Exactly, it hid and blamed you, and because everyone had to be tolerant, see, it was almost
[51:17.760 --> 51:22.240]  really disturbing to watch the other people in the audience because you could tell a lot
[51:22.240 --> 51:26.200]  of them were bleeding heart liberals, and they were essentially, when they were giving
[51:26.200 --> 51:30.800]  the money, they had this look of pride on their face that they were virtue signaling
[51:30.800 --> 51:35.320]  by supporting and giving money to this drag queen that's been so oppressed.
[51:35.320 --> 51:42.400]  And now everyone's being tricked into worshiping something creepy fat men in clown makeup,
[51:42.400 --> 51:48.120]  half naked, shaking their butts in kids' faces, suddenly this total debasement of everybody
[51:48.120 --> 51:49.320]  is cool and wonderful.
[51:49.320 --> 51:52.920]  Oh, but they want strip bars shut down because it debases women.
[51:52.920 --> 51:55.040]  No, they want to control women.
[51:55.040 --> 52:00.000]  The left wants to pimp and run women because women are the heart of all civilization.
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.160]  The advertisers know it, every culture knew it, Islam keeps them locked up.
[52:04.160 --> 52:06.520]  The West does it, and that's why the West is under attack.
[52:06.520 --> 52:11.040]  And it's disgusting when you would see that those toddlers, those young little beauty
[52:11.040 --> 52:16.080]  queens kind of being overly sexualized when they have them all done up in makeup.
[52:16.080 --> 52:20.120]  They have false teeth to make it look like they have adult women teeth, thicker hair
[52:20.120 --> 52:23.360]  weaves to make it look like they have more hair like adult women, and then now you're
[52:23.360 --> 52:28.480]  seeing it being done to little boys dressed in drag with full on drag.
[52:28.480 --> 52:30.400]  Really do the Jon Benet Ramsey thing was creepy.
[52:30.400 --> 52:32.640]  This is like 50 levels crazier.
[52:32.640 --> 52:34.320]  I mean, it's the craziest.
[52:34.320 --> 52:38.240]  In fact, we've not shown the footage here on radio and TV, but we're going to start
[52:38.240 --> 52:39.240]  getting to it now.
[52:39.240 --> 52:43.160]  The full footage that's in her piece, I guess there's even more, is on infowars.com.
[52:43.160 --> 52:45.240]  Let's put it on screen.
[52:45.240 --> 52:47.760]  Everyone doesn't want to watch this, but you've got to watch it.
[52:47.760 --> 52:49.720]  You've got to know what's going on in your public schools.
[52:49.720 --> 52:52.040]  You've got to know what's happening in public, what's happening.
[52:52.040 --> 52:54.040]  It's on infowars.com.
[52:54.040 --> 52:59.560]  Drag Queen Festival in Austin promotes early sexual gender confusion.
[52:59.560 --> 53:04.960]  And again, I have fought so hard on this title today until it's become one of these metaphysical
[53:04.960 --> 53:08.120]  things that is nearly impossible to get right.
[53:08.120 --> 53:10.880]  But we're going to get the headline right right now live on air.
[53:10.880 --> 53:12.960]  Put the headline back up for me, please.
[53:12.960 --> 53:14.880]  We're going to do this right now.
[53:14.880 --> 53:21.520]  The headline is Drag Queen Festival in Austin promotes early sexualization of children,
[53:21.520 --> 53:28.440]  early sexualization of children, slash gender confusion.
[53:28.440 --> 53:32.080]  My kingdom for a horse, a horse, a horse, a kingdom for my horse.
[53:32.080 --> 53:33.200]  It's just funny how things work.
[53:33.200 --> 53:39.280]  Things run so well around here, but once something doesn't work, hell could just come out of
[53:39.280 --> 53:41.480]  the ground and kill us.
[53:41.480 --> 53:45.240]  Because I have been, for three hours, hammering this headline.
[53:45.240 --> 53:49.320]  Hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering,
[53:49.320 --> 53:50.320]  hammering, hammering.
[53:50.320 --> 53:54.320]  Put it back up, because my life's going to be complete once this is exchanged, okay?
[53:54.320 --> 54:00.160]  Because it's Drag Queen Festival in Austin promotes early sexualization of children,
[54:00.160 --> 54:02.240]  forward slash gender confusion.
[54:02.240 --> 54:05.360]  Okay, that is the headline for YouTube.
[54:05.360 --> 54:06.660]  That is the headline.
[54:06.660 --> 54:07.660]  That is the headline.
[54:07.660 --> 54:09.160]  Excuse me, go ahead.
[54:09.160 --> 54:15.320]  Well, you know, the whole lesson from this thing, this experience going to this festival,
[54:15.320 --> 54:16.800]  which was so creepy.
[54:16.800 --> 54:20.480]  The energy there was just so dark, so creepy.
[54:20.480 --> 54:24.640]  I wanted to leave many parts of it just seeing that the way that the children would be being
[54:24.640 --> 54:26.920]  exposed to mature content.
[54:26.920 --> 54:30.460]  But the lesson here is that this is a slippery slope.
[54:30.460 --> 54:35.440]  When you start saying, okay, it's okay to bring drag queens into schools and have them
[54:35.440 --> 54:41.480]  do these book story time telling, well, these are the same people that are going and performing
[54:41.480 --> 54:45.480]  at these drag festivals, and now children are being drugged into it.
[54:45.480 --> 54:52.480]  You have children being overly sexualized, watching these drag queens twerking around.
[54:52.480 --> 54:56.480]  They had them, like, spreading their legs, dance around on these rings.
[54:56.480 --> 54:57.480]  Woo!
[54:57.480 --> 54:58.480]  We got it.
[54:58.480 --> 54:59.480]  The headline's up there.
[54:59.480 --> 55:00.480]  Let's put it up there.
[55:00.480 --> 55:03.600]  Here is a man humping with his butt in the air.
[55:03.600 --> 55:04.600]  He's like twerking or something.
[55:04.600 --> 55:09.280]  With children running over, giving him money, and then they're pole-dancing men.
[55:09.280 --> 55:13.800]  Men dress as women with children, and then a woman in a jib.
[55:13.800 --> 55:14.800]  What about that?
[55:14.800 --> 55:15.800]  Oh, yeah.
[55:15.800 --> 55:16.800]  That was the weirdest part of all.
[55:16.800 --> 55:22.080]  There was a woman in a hijab there, and she was giving money to the little trans drag
[55:22.080 --> 55:24.160]  queen child.
[55:24.160 --> 55:27.760]  You know under Islam, men having sex with boys is okay.
[55:27.760 --> 55:29.800]  Men with men, they execute you.
[55:29.800 --> 55:31.200]  That was just very confusing.
[55:31.200 --> 55:32.200]  I couldn't...
[55:32.200 --> 55:33.200]  Look at this!
[55:33.200 --> 55:34.200]  Let me go back.
[55:34.200 --> 55:36.280]  We've got a man dressed like a woman with a shirt off.
[55:36.280 --> 55:37.280]  I mean, this is just...
[55:37.280 --> 55:38.840]  And here's the thing here.
[55:38.840 --> 55:43.680]  This particular image that we are watching is a boy who calls himself lactatia as a drag
[55:43.680 --> 55:48.520]  queen, and they're making fun of, oh, I'm a lactator, lactatia, and they're making fun
[55:48.520 --> 55:49.520]  of it.
[55:49.520 --> 55:50.520]  And it's like, no, you're not.
[55:50.520 --> 55:51.520]  Okay?
[55:51.520 --> 55:52.520]  No, you're not.
[55:52.520 --> 55:55.680]  And the slap in the face here is they want us to acknowledge them as women.
[55:55.680 --> 55:56.680]  Excuse me.
[55:56.680 --> 55:57.680]  You are not a woman.
[55:57.680 --> 56:00.760]  You do not have to deal with a monthly pain in the butt.
[56:00.760 --> 56:01.760]  Well, they talk about...
[56:01.760 --> 56:02.760]  They do not have to deal with women's problems.
[56:02.760 --> 56:03.760]  They talk about cultural appropriation.
[56:03.760 --> 56:04.760]  They talk about cultural appropriation.
[56:04.760 --> 56:12.200]  This is cultural appropriation, saying you're a woman, but then they tell anybody else so
[56:12.200 --> 56:15.200]  you can't go to the Oktoberfest if you're not German, or you can't go to a single demy
[56:15.200 --> 56:18.800]  if you're not Mexican, trying to keep us all in our little grips controlled, but then they
[56:18.800 --> 56:22.920]  literally appropriate the whole deal, and then tell you what it is to be a woman.
[56:22.920 --> 56:24.600]  You're not a womb man.
[56:24.600 --> 56:26.480]  A womb man.
[56:26.480 --> 56:29.560]  A man with a womb, okay?
[56:29.560 --> 56:32.480]  Women have to deal with certain things, certain problems, certain issues.
[56:32.480 --> 56:36.680]  You don't get to choose, you know, whether or not you're going to deal with certain
[56:36.680 --> 56:40.520]  womenly issues, especially your monthly issue there.
[56:40.520 --> 56:45.360]  But these guys that want to dress up as women and say they're women, make a mockery, disrespect
[56:45.360 --> 56:46.360]  women.
[56:46.360 --> 56:47.360]  Absolutely.
[56:47.360 --> 56:48.440]  They want to claim rights of womanhood.
[56:48.440 --> 56:52.360]  They want to claim that they should be able to compete alongside women in women's sport.
[56:52.360 --> 56:58.520]  Hey, even in the Olympics now, the main winners of the races are men that say they're women.
[56:58.520 --> 56:59.520]  Exactly.
[56:59.520 --> 57:04.280]  It's this total freakazoid world where they say, we're hateful because we believe there's
[57:04.280 --> 57:08.200]  a male whale, a female whale, a male possum, a female possum.
[57:08.200 --> 57:10.280]  You know, there's a male lizard, a female lizard.
[57:10.280 --> 57:13.920]  I mean, this is a total overthrow of reality.
[57:13.920 --> 57:17.640]  And then saying on the entrance forms, we don't have a right to say male or female because
[57:17.640 --> 57:18.840]  that might hurt somebody else.
[57:18.840 --> 57:20.960]  They have new pronouns for it all.
[57:20.960 --> 57:21.960]  We never got to the video.
[57:21.960 --> 57:26.400]  We played some of the images for TV viewers, but it's on infowars.com and we did get the
[57:26.400 --> 57:29.640]  headline right, which is awesome.
[57:29.640 --> 57:37.200]  Drag Queen Festival in Austin promotes early sexualization of children, gender confusion.
[57:37.200 --> 57:40.320]  And it's key to get out because they've gone a step too far.
[57:40.320 --> 57:41.320]  Oh, look, it's a unicorn.
[57:41.320 --> 57:47.800]  I forgot to mention the naked guy with the little kid is a unicorn, so it's okay.
[57:47.800 --> 57:53.800]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality infowars biome defense
[57:53.800 --> 57:55.400]  probiotic.
[57:55.400 --> 58:02.120]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have
[58:02.120 --> 58:09.800]  been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[58:09.800 --> 58:14.760]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over
[58:14.760 --> 58:21.440]  23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[58:21.440 --> 58:26.000]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.560]  probiotic on the market.
[58:28.560 --> 58:33.600]  Support your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at infowarslife.com today
[58:33.600 --> 58:37.200]  and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[58:37.200 --> 58:41.440]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public,
[58:41.440 --> 58:48.760]  so please take advantage of it today, support your own health and support the infowar.
[58:48.760 --> 58:52.720]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[58:52.720 --> 58:58.080]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the infowar, a 360 win.
[58:58.080 --> 59:03.080]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[59:03.080 --> 59:04.680]  at infowarsstore.com.
[59:04.680 --> 59:08.520]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[59:08.520 --> 59:12.600]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[59:12.600 --> 59:17.840]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[59:17.840 --> 59:21.880]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[59:21.880 --> 59:23.680]  the products that you need each month.
[59:23.680 --> 59:27.360]  Just go to infowarsstore.com, select your favorite product or products.
[59:27.360 --> 59:31.440]  Click on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[59:31.440 --> 59:36.720]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com,
[59:36.720 --> 59:38.040]  this is a sure win.
[59:38.040 --> 59:44.120]  10% off on auto ship, win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[59:44.120 --> 59:51.360]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[59:51.360 --> 59:58.360]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:58.360 --> 01:00:16.360]  I'm Alex Jones, Billy Weber, our great reporter here, and you know what, this type of stuff
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.360]  gets to me.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:23.520]  When I start actually flipping out on air, it's because attacks on our youth, attacks
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:28.320]  on our innocence, when they're so overt, make me physically sick.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.280]  And to know how the media is going to spin it and how they're going to hide behind stuff,
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.880]  they see what matter.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:39.880]  You know, Millie, Weber, and Gavin Wentz cut out of the report people touching children
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:40.880]  inappropriately.
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.360]  And I think you should give it to the police department.
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:48.880]  No, you got to take the gloves off, and you know, I just, that's what we're getting into.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:53.640]  Recap what we were just covering, kind of put some bookends on this.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.720]  I got some of the report earlier, we showed some of it.
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:59.640]  I've got an AP report we could get to, which showed the gateway to this, oh, you're going
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.640]  to be a drag queen.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:01.640]  Here's how you're a drag queen.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.640]  Shake your butt.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.120]  Again, it's all sexualization of children.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.120]  It's manipulating them.
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:10.880]  It's introducing them at a young age to a lifestyle that parents should be able to choose.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:13.760]  The argument here is parents were taking their kids to this, and some of them were useful
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.760]  idiots.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:20.000]  But I mean, just the images of, I mean, how did you handle it when you saw men with nothing
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.440]  on naked but glitter on their genitals with little boys dressed as girls?
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.840]  It was disturbing.
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.840]  It was disturbing.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:32.640]  I felt sick to my stomach as I'm watching this, and at the same time, I can't help but fear
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:38.160]  the backlash from the liberal community, LGBT community of, oh, you're hateful.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.160]  You're hateful.
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:42.240]  There's nothing to do with being against homosexuality.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.720]  But see how that gives those folks the moral high ground to dictate to all the gays and
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.560]  lesbians what their politics are.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:53.240]  To now, we've got men with glitter genitals with small children in public.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.320]  I mean, what the hell is this?
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:00.280]  If cops busted in a door, and there was a guy like this with a kid, you'd go to jail.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:03.520]  But it's hiding in plain view, so it's like, okay.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:07.560]  And they want to make you feel like you're doing something wrong by criticizing their
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:13.720]  community when in reality, the criticism here is that this is inappropriate and mature content
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.600]  that children should not be being exposed to.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.160]  And then it keeps expanding.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.160]  The community?
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:20.600]  I mean, does the community include Nambla?
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:21.600]  I'm sure.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.280]  I wouldn't be surprised if there were Nambla members there.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:33.160]  I mean, you had a lot of dudes who looked very kind of turned on watching these drag queens,
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:37.040]  these men dressed in drag, and then they're watching children as well.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.680]  And so it was just a really creepy vibe, the entire thing.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:49.000]  And kids are watching these little micro-sexual encounters between the adult men and the drag
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.920]  queens, and they're giving them money.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.880]  And then the kid comes up there, and they're getting money from these same men.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.560]  They're getting money from the same people in the audience.
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:00.360]  And it's almost like it's grooming kids to become strippers.
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.320]  I mean, that's what I thought when I was watching.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:07.640]  Now imagine if people took their kids to a heterosexual event and had them handing money
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:08.640]  to hot women.
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.600]  It'd be like, dude, this is creepy, man.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.600]  What are you doing?
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:19.880]  Women dancing around provocatively, with tape on their boobs, and then you have children
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:24.080]  dancing alongside them, you know, following up their act, and they're still giving money
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:25.080]  to them.
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.080]  But this is nothing what you're showing.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.960]  I mean, there's men hanging upside down, kids giving them money, men on the ground shaking
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.320]  their butts in children's faces.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.560]  I mean, this is just bizarre.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:36.520]  Well, some of the part that you're seeing here is the explicit language, the bad language
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.080]  that they're talking about, announcing one of the people here.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:42.920]  Well, that's why I decided not to play this on radio, because I'd reviewed it this morning,
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.800]  but then it clicked.
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:49.240]  Some of these words, I think, are FCC violations, plus just, I just can't air this.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.800]  I just can't even air this.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.360]  No, I didn't know what to do after we got this.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:57.240]  And imagine they'll probably ban these videos on Facebook and YouTube later once we post
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.560]  them, saying it's inappropriate.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.760]  Well, then how the hell do you got four-year-old kids there?
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.760]  Exactly.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:06.880]  If it's not appropriate for the radio, how is it appropriate for children?
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.480]  We have little, little children there.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:12.920]  I think I saw a kid around three years old dressed in a princess outfit, which you can
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.240]  tell the child was a boy.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.240]  But I mean-
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.560]  And this is the parents doing it to him, as Camille Paglia said, a liberal lesbian who
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:21.800]  is not a child abuser.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.280]  Hey, I totally get Camille Paglia liking women.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.400]  I was a woman, I probably would.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:26.400]  I'm a libertarian.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.640]  But the point is, I'd not leave kids alone, man.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:30.640]  Leave them out of it.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.640]  Leave them out of it.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:32.920]  It's too much, too soon.
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.440]  Who knows the ramification of-
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.440]  And then a boy dressed as a girl being worshipped by a bunch of potbelly guys?
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.440]  Oh, yeah.
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.440]  Yes.
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:40.440]  I mean, wow, this is not good.
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:41.440]  Hey, Millie Weaver, great job.
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.440]  Gavin Winske, great job.
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:46.920]  Let's look at that other footage and get that to the police department.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:51.400]  By the way, they've now accused Matt Drudge of being a Russian agent when we come back,
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:57.400]  so for being associated with them for worse.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:00.560]  America is an information-based civil war.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:04.240]  That's why now, more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:07.960]  globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bullies.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:14.320]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:20.320]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.960]  the counterculture.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:28.000]  The real punk rock is being a patriot, who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom,
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.800]  who at the same time is tolerant.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:35.600]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:40.920]  They are the anti-liberalists who defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.920]  freedom worldwide.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:47.440]  We've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:51.120]  well as more Patriot Apparel at infowarstore.com.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:06:20.200]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at infowarstore.com.
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:30.880]  We have seen them openly saying that Rand Paul is a Russian agent on the Senate floor,
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.680]  John McCain, or Tucker Carlson has had the Congressman on the say, you're a Russian
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.160]  agent, you're getting paid, aren't you?
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:46.840]  And we've seen them say it about yours truly, Matt Drudge, everybody, it is just crazy.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:52.120]  But here is a big story out of the Washington Post by Philip Bump that I'm going to talk
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.080]  about a little bit later in the hour.
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:07:00.600]  Washington Post accuses Drudge of Russian collusion for linking to info wars.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.920]  Left-wing papers suggest Matt Drudge a Russian agent.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:07.560]  They didn't play semantical games and say that I'm a plagiarist for posting part of
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.560]  RT articles and linking to them.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:14.400]  Well, yeah, also post full articles from Voice of America doesn't mean I work for the CIA.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:18.280]  I also republished all those WikiLeaks last week from the CIA.
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.480]  Did that mean I did all the hacking or I support the CIA?
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.000]  It's like these semantical games.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.240]  Jones posted quotes from Hitler.
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.160]  They actually wrote this last year.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.000]  Does he support Hitler?
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.240]  Okay, they're waging war on communication.
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:37.440]  They're creating more than hysteria.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:41.320]  It's like a, what's the word for it?
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:45.360]  You're afraid to walk under ladders, superstition.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:46.360]  It's like an idiocracy.
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.720]  They go, wow, this one can read.
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.680]  What kind of weirdos he?
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:51.680]  Not sure.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:52.680]  Well, that's your name.
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:53.680]  Not sure.
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:54.680]  No, I'm not sure.
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.680]  Oh, not sure.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.680]  Okay.
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:57.680]  Not sure.
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:02.560]  And then they report like our investigative teams found he linked to info wars hundreds
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.200]  of times and he linked to RT.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:12.200]  And then he leaked 5,000 times to the New York Times, which if I was drudge, I'd stop
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.200]  even doing that.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:17.000]  I mean, he links to them, gives them half their traffic, literally, Washington Post,
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.440]  New York Times, half their traffic's from drudge some weeks.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:21.840]  I know ours is too.
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:25.560]  I mean, drudge is like the King Daddy, biggest website in the world, number two in the world
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:29.120]  technically, but biggest news site.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:37.480]  And then they sit there and attack him for linking to Russian news.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:42.320]  Yeah, if Russia has footage of a plane blowing up or a Putin speech, you bet that's news.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:45.200]  And then they double link and go, oh, and then he links to Alex Jones.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.200]  Don't link to him.
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.760]  Well, thanks for the gift because I know.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:55.880]  Oh, but now they're starting to complain that he's stopped linking to them as much.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:00.760]  And if you look, he links to them way more than he links to us.
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:10.440]  This is the scum trying to bully drudge to link more to them, even though it's 10 to
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:15.080]  one, 20 to one, depending on the newspaper, or they'll say he's a Russian.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:19.000]  When they're the ones the Democrats caught working with the Russians, and they're the
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.120]  ones with a huge history of it, and they're the ones with the pedestrian group closing
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:30.600]  because of it, and drudge points out that on average, he gives them 37% of their traffic.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.400]  I was saying half their traffic sometimes, because I've seen those numbers, but yeah,
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:41.320]  37% literally giving them hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising revenue and they
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:44.840]  want to shut him down.
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:46.800]  And then he links to us a lot less.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:50.240]  And they're like, hey, we're going to call you a Russian agent and try and have a federal
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:57.040]  elections commission and a federal trade commission investigation criminally to shut you down.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.520]  You talk about crapping on somebody.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.160]  You talk about rubbing it in.
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:04.360]  You talk about telling people what they can and can't link to.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:08.080]  And what do they point to that they've linked to here?
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:12.360]  That WikiLeaks server was under attack and a press release by Julian Assange.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:16.320]  And then that's the proof in the article, because Julian Assange is a Russian agent,
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:23.000]  looks like Rand Paul, just like I am, of course, it's not true.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  So this is just incredible.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:31.600]  Gavin McGinnis joins us, syndicated radio and TV host, founder of Vice, you name it.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.520]  I want to get into this, get into political correctness.
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.040]  I want to keep you for longer than 30 minutes.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.040]  We can do it.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:41.560]  No, I'm coming on your show in a few days, but just it's going into overdrive the desperation
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.080]  with this Russia crap.
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.760]  And I used to laugh at it, but man, I'm not laughing anymore.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:50.200]  They have intelligence committee hearings, house committee hearings, and they say, Jones
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:55.920]  is a Russian agent, no proof, no judge, no indictment, no FBI at my office, just totalize
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:59.720]  like saying, I'm a, you know, Easter Bunny from Pluto.
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:02.520]  And they go, well, don't worry, we censored him at lunch.
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.760]  And it's just like, it's bizarre.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.240]  It's not like even a movie.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.800]  It's really happening.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.600]  You've been, you've been censored alive.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:12.480]  You were basically banned from being a comedian because of this.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:15.240]  And they're just eating their own, but they, they never know when to quit.
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.240]  They're just getting crazy.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.520]  Gav McGinnis, what do you think's going on here?
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:21.080]  Well, we're seeing the progression of lunacy.
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:25.380]  I mean, over the past year, it started with fake news.
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:27.640]  And then I stopped saying that because it wasn't just fake.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:28.640]  It was deranged.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.640]  So I called it mentally ill news.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:35.880]  And now it's crazy ex-girlfriend news where she goes, I know you were with that Russian
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880]  chick.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880]  And you go, what are you talking about?
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:40.360]  I just went out for beers with, with Matt.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:41.360]  Yeah.
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:45.200]  Matt was talking to someone else talking to Alex and Alex was talking to that Russian
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.200]  chick.
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:50.840]  So you're, you're with her now when you go, wow, you're deluded lady, please stop coming
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:51.840]  to my work.
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.040]  Please stop screaming at me about people you think I was with.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:00.120]  Meanwhile, by the way, she's in bed with a Russian like for all this scrutiny, the left
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:04.920]  demands, you turn the tables to them and you point the mirror at them and we find out,
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:09.000]  oh, she's on Craigslist setting up Russian gangbanks.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.320]  We've got Russian setting up ads on Facebook.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.640]  We've got lies about the Trump prostitute Dossay.
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:20.360]  So every time they get just a taste of what they put us through, they're exposed for the
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:25.160]  perverts and the colluders and the, the election rigors that they are.
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:30.360]  They got a lot of nerve though, calling Rand Paul and Tucker Carlson Russian agents just
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.360]  because they disagree with them.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:35.520]  I mean, where do you see all this going as they've, you're right, they've reached crazy
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.680]  ex-girlfriend level.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:38.680]  They really have.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:45.440]  The New York Post did a feature today about a threesome I had in 1994 saying that we're
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.840]  bragging about sexual encounters.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:48.840]  Yeah.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:49.840]  Sorry.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:50.840]  I got laid when I was 24.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:51.840]  I'm 47.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:52.840]  Oh, that's the same thing.
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:55.840]  They're digging through everything in the world, just looking at her smile to tell lies.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.480]  And it's all like, Jones had a lot of girlfriends.
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:00.520]  I mean, it's like, what do they got?
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:01.520]  Nothing.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.520]  Sorry.
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:05.600]  Steven Segal was in the news today in 1991.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:14.320]  He asked a woman to sit on his face, Oh my God, stop the presses.
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.320]  So where does it go?
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:18.920]  Because I asked you a year ago, I said, if we reached peak insanity, you said no.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:21.400]  So when do we reach it?
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:26.560]  That's a great question because I thought we were going through the normal stages of what
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:32.000]  do you call it death, despair, whether it's, it's a denial and then it's depression and
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.920]  then it's, it's anger and it's acceptance.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:38.640]  I forget the exact degrees, but we started out with those, but we didn't go to the next
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.640]  one.
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:42.880]  They just kept going on the crazy one and it's gotten crazier and crazier.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.480]  They're getting people fired.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.960]  They're making up lies.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:49.640]  I think the way, the way it ends is riots.
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:52.800]  It really has to end there because there's no rationale here.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.280]  They refuse to talk to you.
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:56.240]  They refuse to, you know, they hate free speech.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:00.920]  They don't want to give Nazis a platform and the Nazi is anyone that likes Trump.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:02.800]  So you go, well, I can't rational.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.720]  I can't, I can't ration with you.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:07.640]  You're out of your goddamn mind.
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:09.960]  I don't know what to do here.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:10.960]  There is no end.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.920]  By the way, Nazis are making a comeback, not in the real world.
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:18.480]  All over Austin, I see Nazi symbols with X's through them, with people driving around
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.520]  in their cars like they're secretly Nazis.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:23.000]  Meanwhile, it's a real live Nazi collaborator.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.920]  That's their main financier, George Soros, the guy who turned in Jews.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:33.720]  And by the way, Ezra Levant has been in court ever since he wrote a 600-word article that
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:39.220]  basically just quoted George Soros from his books and said, this guy worked with the Nazis.
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:44.280]  And these useful idiots on the left, Soros just feeds them garbage and they go, yeah,
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:45.280]  that's it.
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.280]  We want to destroy society.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.080]  We want to destroy families.
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:51.440]  We want kids to be little gay transsexuals.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:55.920]  We want all women to stop breeding, have 20-year-olds tying up their ovaries.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:59.120]  They got men getting vasectomies and then having parties.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.200]  They're castrating men and then the men are celebrating.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:04.160]  That's how brainwashed these globalists are.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:07.880]  Then we bring in refugees that want to sabotage the country.
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:15.160]  And AJ Plus, which is from Qatar, a Muslim country is sending in propaganda here with
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.600]  AJ Plus and everyone is gobbling up going, oh, the problem is Nazis.
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.000]  The problem is domestic terrorists.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.480]  Just gobbling up these lies.
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.200]  It's amazing how gullible we are.
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.920]  Yeah, McGuinness is our guest.
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:28.640]  We're going to come back into whatever subject he wants.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.080]  I got a ton to cover, but he brought up trying to sexualize children.
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:36.040]  We got footage this weekend that's up on infowars.com.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:42.880]  It's the most shocking I've ever seen, period, of a drag queen festival, but it wasn't really
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:43.880]  that.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:48.760]  It was little kids with guys on stripper poles handing men money and tucking money into their
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:56.080]  waistbands and men naked posing with children, I'm not kidding, stay with us.

[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.440]  quality lab standard.

[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:10.880]  And when we sell products at this lower price, we've got to sell a lot of it to fund the
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.880]  operation.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.840]  But I know the products are so good that even though we make a very small profit on each

[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.160]  With the free shipping folks, it's a loss leader.
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:45.640]  You sign up for auto-ship, we're losing like $6, $7 on this.
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:47.680]  Doesn't matter, I just want you to see how great it is.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:51.960]  We are now four and a half hours into the worldwide broadcast, America Rebirth, and
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:59.360]  Renaissance was so much coming up today.
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:13.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:19.040]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:30.560]  We're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:35.560]  You have McGinnis with the popular TV slash radio show on CRTV, conservative view television.
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:38.080]  You probably see the ads all over Drudge and all over the internet.
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:42.360]  It has a lot of viewers, a lot of listeners, very excited about the expansion of what he's
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:49.000]  doing because those of us that have held on this long and had this much success are
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.920]  a rare breed, and that's why I just appreciate everybody who's taking action and standing
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:57.720]  up for the truth because we are in the fight of our lives.
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.560]  You were really boiling it down in a very eloquent later in the break.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.640]  We repeat that, Gavin McGinnis for us.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.840]  Well, first of all, this is all about power with the left.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:10.680]  The reason that our message contradicts itself when they say, we're feminists, then they
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:13.360]  have Linda Sarsour running the women's march.
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.920]  She wants women to be second class citizen, but she's the head of the march.
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:25.400]  Or they say they love free speech at DePaul, yet they have Rasma O'Day who was doing a
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:28.160]  fundraiser after killing two Israelis, yet they won't let me speak.
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:32.120]  So their message keeps contradicting itself, and that's because it's not about the message,
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:33.120]  it's about power.
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:38.280]  That's why they don't want to debate you or me or Paul Joseph Watson or Mark Dice or
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:40.960]  any of the adpocalypse people like Lauren Southern.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:42.440]  They want to shut us down.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.240]  They want to control the narrative.
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:45.240]  They want power.
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.600]  They don't care about the message.
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:50.000]  That's also why they invite all these jihadists in who are saboteurs.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.440]  They know that jihadists are homophobes and sexists, but they go, at least like little
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:59.200]  gremlins, you'll get in and destroy my enemy, and then I can hold all the power.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.680]  I can dominate.
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:02.520]  But here's what they don't get.
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:07.040]  We've been going through this crap for decades and decades.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.520]  I've survived vice.
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.160]  I've survived political correctness.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:14.560]  I've survived having my ad agency shut down, and all it's done is made us stronger.
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:15.960]  We're like Spartans now.
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:18.320]  It's sort of like, I don't know if you ever had a little brother, but I used to bully
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:21.960]  my little brother all the time, just punch him in the arm and give him a Charlie horse.
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:25.720]  I didn't realize I was accidentally training a ninja.
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:30.360]  And by the time he was 16, he could beat the crap out of me.
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:33.840]  And now when we play this game, when we play pool, if you sink the white ball, you get
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.200]  to punch the other guy.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:38.040]  When he punches me, it feels like I've been hit by a car.
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.760]  Like I've turned him into a monster.
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.120]  And that's what they've done with us.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.120]  They cannot shut us down.
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:46.880]  We are no longer a worthy adversary.
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:49.280]  We are superior to them.
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:52.920]  And it's because our audience knows what we've been through.
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:53.920]  They've been through it.
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:54.920]  They understand.
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:59.440]  We are literally one, and we're winning, and people are committed behind us, spreading
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:03.880]  the word financially, and that's what enrages, absolutely enrages the globalists.
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:08.080]  And you were talking about what happened with one of your colleagues, how as soon as you
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.960]  targeted Soros, all these little lawsuits came from leftists.
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.480]  It's the exact same thing happened to us.
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:13.960]  We've been told, leave Soros alone.
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:14.960]  Leave the Muslims alone.
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:15.960]  It's going to stop.
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:16.960]  Hey, come on.
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:17.960]  Let's go.
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:18.960]  I'm not backing off.
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.400]  I'm not shutting up ever, because that'd be like dying.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:22.400]  I'm never giving up.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:26.640]  I'm never getting in, especially when we're starting to win so hard, starting to win and
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:27.640]  all.
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:28.640]  This is a total victory.
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:29.960]  I'll fight to the death.
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:30.960]  They don't understand.
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:35.000]  All the people who were sort of on the fence, they booted those wimps out long ago.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.120]  How does the poem go?
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:43.920]  The brave lack all conviction, yet the weak are full of passionate intensity, or the
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:46.400]  wrong or full of passionate intensity.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:49.920]  All the sort of people who weren't sure about what they were doing are long gone.
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:53.480]  It's sort of like the Scots after seven years of war with the English.
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:57.680]  The only ones that are left love conflict, love war.
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:59.040]  We enjoy all this.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:04.160]  Like when we're on right wing watch or media matters, that's a compliment to us.
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.600]  Don't you understand?
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:08.040]  The people scared of you are long gone.
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:11.560]  You only have the Spartans left, and our swords are unshifed.
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:16.120]  Well, what it comes down to is you're so committed, you've gone through so much, and you know
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:19.080]  how bad the enemy is, and you know you're on the right track, and you know you're not
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.200]  going to turn your children's future over to them.
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:24.280]  It's just an empowering feeling beyond hatred.
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:25.280]  It's love.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:27.280]  It's love of our children, love of justice.
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:30.720]  We are just committed, and they can feel it.
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:31.720]  And children are great.
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:35.920]  I'm glad you spent so much time talking about this drag show in Austin, because the children
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:37.880]  are a focal point here.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:42.120]  Maybe because we have kids, and we know what a future means, and we're concerned about
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.120]  grandchildren.
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:45.320]  Unlike Merkel, we have skin in the game.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:50.200]  But these people, these childless hordes, they don't understand what children are like,
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:52.200]  and they sit there saying they're sexual.
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:56.160]  Kids, a 10-year-old doesn't ask you about tits, okay?
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.520]  Sex isn't on their radar in any way.
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.240]  If you're watching a movie, and there's a weird romantic scene, they just sort of go
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:05.760]  bleh, they don't go, hey dad, what's going on over there?
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:09.440]  But the way they sexualize these kids makes it clear to me that they don't have kids,
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:12.720]  they don't know kids, and that's really what's the plan of the goblers.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:17.040]  Let's make these people childless, and then we can start sabotaging children, and we can
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:21.200]  start normalizing pedophilia and normalizing trans children.
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.520]  They're worse than saboteurs.
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:23.760]  They're like a virus.
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.240]  They're like a cultural plague.
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:29.680]  And by the way, even Camille Paglia, that is a real liberal, analesmian, she says trying
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:33.360]  to sexualize kids and telling their another gender when they're five years old is serious
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.360]  abuse.
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:35.360]  It is.
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.360]  It is.
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:37.360]  And they give them hormone blockers.
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:40.280]  And when you give a kid hormone blockers, by the way, you don't just stop them from
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.640]  having pubes.
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:45.400]  You make that girl infertile for the rest of her life.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.360]  And I imagine that you can't get a tattoo till you're 18.
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:50.520]  And listen, they're dressing little boys.
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:54.160]  They're not just trying to make girls pick up guns and be the army men like every Hollywood
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.960]  movie admits they're pushing.
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:01.200]  Now it's, they brought their little boys, three, four, five years old, in princess outfits
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:02.680]  to put them in front of TV cameras.
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:03.680]  They're like, yeah, film.
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:04.680]  Put it on the internet.
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:05.680]  Yeah, what's going on?
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:07.300]  Well, you know what it is, too.
[01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:11.160]  It's weak white people who are ashamed of being white and they want some sort of culture.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.920]  They go, it's not okay to be white.
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:13.920]  You're terrible.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:14.920]  You did slavery.
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:15.920]  You killed the Indians.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:16.920]  Your life sucks.
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:17.920]  You're a loser.
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:20.160]  And these wimps go, well, how can I get out of this mess?
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:21.160]  Well, be gay.
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:22.160]  And I'm not gay.
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.160]  Well, be a race.
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.160]  I'm not a race.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:25.160]  My kids gay.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.400]  What if I have a trans kid?
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:29.840]  Okay, then you're off the hook and you're in the in crowd.
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:30.840]  Yay.
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:31.840]  Here, Timmy.
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:32.840]  Put on a dress.
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:36.880]  as young as one and two, two-year-olds can barely talk.
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.300]  And now you know that kid's a girl?
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:40.960]  You're a sick pig.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.320]  Can you imagine how those children
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.800]  are gonna rebel against that type of crap?
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:48.640]  In a way, they're starting an army for us.
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:51.000]  You're not gonna get a more conservative kid
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.400]  than a boy who was adopted by two lesbians
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:54.560]  and keeps getting hammered
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.640]  about how he's a girl his whole life.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.760]  He's gonna be the head of the military.
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.240]  You're making a new mad dog right there.
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:01.280]  A couple of weeks ago,
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:03.320]  my wife had some family in town.
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:05.240]  They went out to this horse riding place
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:07.320]  and it was a lesbian that ran it.
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:08.480]  And again, we're not against her.
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.320]  She likes women.
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.160]  Okay, whatever.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:11.000]  I wanna get that up front.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:11.880]  They always say, oh, you just hate me.
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:12.960]  No, no, no.
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:15.760]  She literally was bossing everyone around
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:20.760]  and then hitting on my wife's niece,
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:24.680]  who's like 18, openly and bossing the women around.
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:26.640]  It was her women family that came.
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:29.040]  And then she had like a son that was like a slave
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:32.040]  that she yelled at who ran around, hunched back.
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:33.160]  And then she would brag
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.080]  about how she had her son under her control.
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:37.480]  And she was just having kids to have slaves.
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:39.880]  And it's like, you realize there's not just oppressors
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:41.520]  that come as heterosexuals.
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.160]  And a lot of the so-called lesbians, man,
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.720]  they are like running the women.
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:47.960]  Oh, they have a brutal domestic abuse problem
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.160]  within their own community
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:52.160]  because what these butch dykes do is
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.000]  they wanna be men
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.520]  but they end up being a caricature of men.
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.160]  Sort of like a 1950s guy.
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:58.680]  So they'll have like a pompadour
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:00.640]  and sideburns with a little thin mustache
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:01.640]  and a wife beater.
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:02.640]  And they'll come up and go,
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:04.920]  hey, where's my lunch, bitch?
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:06.000]  Yeah, I'm a dude.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.680]  I like to fix cars.
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:08.520]  And you go there.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:09.960]  By the way, I was playing pool one time
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:12.320]  with Shane Steiner and his wife, it's a beauty queen,
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.360]  and our kids were playing pool
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.640]  by the bowlinger in the video games.
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:18.120]  And there were actually little like 100 pound lesbians
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:20.080]  with duck's ass haircuts.
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:21.200]  It was actually real stylish.
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:22.960]  Cigarettes, white t-shirts,
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:25.320]  and they walked over and said, she's ours.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:26.640]  And we started laughing
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:29.560]  and they wanted to fight, Shane Steiner
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:33.240]  can literally bench press 400 pounds like 50 times.
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:34.080]  Okay.
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:34.900]  That's the problem with the left.
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:35.840]  They wanna be as we go,
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:38.040]  if you're us, you're gonna get knocked out.
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:40.160]  But the guy does Ujitsu three hours a day
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:41.520]  with Tim Kennedy is like,
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:43.720]  they're like starting fights with a guy
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:45.880]  that would tear your arms out of your socket.
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:47.400]  That's the left in a nutshell.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:50.080]  I'm literally chicks in 50s outfits
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:51.840]  coming over trying to muscle his wife.
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:54.200]  I'm like, dude, no dude would ever do that.
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.080]  Plus Steiner looks like a gorilla.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.000]  It's an o-brainer.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.400]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.320]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine,

[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:04.640]  and other endocrine disruptors,
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:07.400]  pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?

[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:00.440]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:01.600]  Why is this so good?
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.760]  Because people are actually waking up
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:06.920]  to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:09.480]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:12.160]  toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:16.240]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:18.800]  is anything that's harmful to your body that
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:22.680]  lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees,
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:24.200]  spreading disease around.
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:26.800]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:27.880]  These are all parasites.
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.040]  Tell us about all the stuff that's
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:30.560]  said that there's so many things that are in it.
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:31.800]  You have the neem in there.
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:35.000]  You have the organic clove bug, the organic wormwood.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:38.520]  All right.
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.000]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in,
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.400]  because I'm going back on it today.
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.400]  It just came back in yesterday.

[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:29.160]  it's Gala McKinsey.
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:32.960]  Hip, hip, hip.
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:36.520]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.240]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:46.080]  By the way, when I see the Duck Dynasty guy
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:49.440]  and I see Gavin Guinness and I see all these other big people
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.840]  with Levine, though I don't agree with him on everything,
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:54.160]  but at least he's pro-America, pro-free market.
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:57.480]  Now he's pro-Trump, setting up a big TV radio network
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.440]  and starting to get big TV affiliates and everything,
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:00.960]  just like we're doing as well.
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:02.120]  It is just exciting.
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:06.000]  I mean, I just want to, I want to have them so successful
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.800]  that I don't have to work 18 hours a day
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:10.840]  because I feel guilty in this fight if I don't,
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:13.120]  because we're nipping tuck here.
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:16.200]  We're on the verge of winning or losing everything.
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:19.920]  And when you really find out how crazy the enemy is,
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:21.000]  you realize how real this is.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.400]  I'm going to go back to him in a moment,
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:25.440]  but when I described two years ago, whatever it was,
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:28.760]  I was at main events, the name.
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:32.960]  It's got video games and bowling and overbought
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:34.360]  with the food set and the bar set.
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:37.880]  We were over there eating by the pool area,
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:40.280]  the little pool hall and then literally,
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:44.440]  these women came over in 1950s kind of grease outfits,
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:47.760]  had their hair done, duck's ass perfectly, everything.
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:52.760]  And we're actually hitting on my friend's wife
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:59.760]  and she started laughing.
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:03.360]  And then Shane and I couldn't even really say anything
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.640]  because we started laughing,
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:08.360]  but it was like they were in a trance of delusion.
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:10.720]  They kept still walking around right in front of us.
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:14.480]  Like they wanted to fight maybe 110 pound women
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:18.680]  wearing blue jeans, white shirts, cigarettes rolled up
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:21.000]  under their shoulder.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  And it was so weird that they were saying stuff to us
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:27.480]  and we couldn't even talk.
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:28.720]  We all started laughing.
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:30.560]  We were going to play pool.
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.400]  We just got done eating
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:35.000]  and we'd already played bowling and video games
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:35.920]  and did some rock climbing.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.080]  They also have that there.
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:37.960]  We just laughed.
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:42.040]  So you could say we got run off by two women,
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:44.360]  dressed as men, but we didn't want a confrontation.
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:48.160]  Plus it was so weird that they were so delusional
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:49.800]  that they thought they were going to like
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:51.320]  take our woman or something.
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:54.280]  It was just, it's just next level weirdness folks.
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:56.200]  And just like Gavin McGinnis said earlier,
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:57.720]  if you understand that, you understand everything.
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.200]  Now let me just stop right there for a moment.
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:01.840]  Say how we fund ourselves.
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:03.840]  We have a whole line of made American t-shirts.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.160]  We also have t-shirts made in Mexico.
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:08.760]  If you want to pay $5 less, I leave it up to you
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:12.320]  with whatever you want to do.
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:15.520]  But they come in a nice packaging, nice folded up,
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:19.240]  very, very soft fabric, very, very high quality.
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:21.960]  This is the newest shirt that I want to be our best seller
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:24.080]  that I personally wear around town now
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:25.880]  is my favorite shirt of all time.
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.920]  And it says won't tread on me.
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:31.920]  And it's got the Gadsden snake, just simply as the snake,
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:36.440]  very iconic with infowars.com and Daiglo Yellow on the back
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:39.240]  and infowars.com with the American flag
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:40.560]  on the right hand shoulder.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.600]  Now it takes a lot of these obviously
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:44.160]  to be able to fund the operation.
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:46.920]  But what it's really about is spreading the word.
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:50.000]  But it's a designer t-shirt.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.440]  A lot of our t-shirts are $9.95,
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:53.480]  but for the really soft fabric and the quality
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:55.880]  and made in America, all the rest of it is $24.95.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:58.000]  But that purchase funds our operation.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.480]  We got the ball caps, we got all of it.
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:02.200]  We were selling stuff for 50% off the last four days.
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:06.320]  We have to stop because almost every shirt is sold out.
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:08.680]  You want to trigger globalists.
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:11.760]  Man, that is a lot of shirts hitting the streets.
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:14.000]  But on the average, we made about $3
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.960]  because we had free shipping on the shirts as well.
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:17.600]  So you're selling shirts for $9.95.
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.280]  They cost you like five, six bucks.
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.320]  Then you do free shipping.
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:21.880]  I mean, you're losing money on some.
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:23.680]  So shirts are back to regular price,
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:26.040]  but this shirt had been sold out.
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:27.800]  It just came back in.
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:29.760]  What is the name of the shirt?
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:30.600]  I forget the name.
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:31.440]  There it is.
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:32.640]  It won't tread on me t-shirt.
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:34.440]  Oh, obviously, that's what it's called in the front.
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:36.720]  That's my favorite new shirt.
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:40.040]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com,
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:42.960]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:44.800]  And we're extending free shipping,
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.280]  store-wide on everything,
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:47.800]  but all those other specials
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:49.280]  on SuperMill by Telly and all that,
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.880]  it basically is about to sell out.
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:52.200]  So we went back to regular price
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.280]  until more comes back in.
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:55.200]  Caveman is not 50% off,
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:57.520]  ultimate bone broth paleo formula.
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:37:59.240]  Biome Defense, the amazing probiotic,
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:01.400]  it's 50% off and a lot of other things,
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:04.480]  but the older specials had to end,
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.480]  but we have some new specials
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:07.720]  that are only going for two days
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:09.880]  because we're so close to selling out Caveman,
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:11.920]  so close to selling out Biome Defense.
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:13.600]  You're like, well, then why do the discount?
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:15.320]  I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:17.280]  And we've got more coming in in two weeks,
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:18.760]  but I'm still holding the price,
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:20.920]  even though it's set to sell out in the next 24 hours.
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:23.040]  Biome Defense, Infowarslife.com,
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:25.080]  infowarsstore.com or triple eight,
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:26.920]  two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:30.280]  We also have Infowars store gift cards
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:32.360]  that are popular that have five-star reviews.
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:34.800]  That way you give friends and family that at Christmas,
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:37.720]  they come experience Infowars and wake up.
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:42.200]  Infowarsstore.com, be sure and check those out as well.
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:43.960]  Okay, he's with us till the end of the hour.
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:45.120]  This is a short segment,
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:47.320]  longer segment coming up in a moment.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:50.040]  He's with CRTV, Gavin McInnis,
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:51.640]  with his own daily transmission.
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:53.080]  It's so popular.
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:55.480]  Gavin, getting back to that story
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:58.120]  and then expanding, you had an example,
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:38:59.640]  you texted me during the break,
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:02.040]  of popular culture that is a metaphor
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:04.320]  for what you're getting into.
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:07.640]  Well, yeah, there's this war on a poo right now,
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:10.240]  the East Indian gentleman who runs the quickie mart
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.440]  on the Simpsons.
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:13.560]  So there's a problem with a poo,
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:16.680]  because that's a stereotype of an Indian.
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:20.160]  And there's some Indian American comedian who says,
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:21.880]  you know, I was bullied as a young boy,
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:25.360]  they would do his accent and they made me feel uncomfortable.
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.640]  And you go, wait a minute, Indian Americans,
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:29.440]  not American Indians, but the brown ones,
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:31.880]  feather, dot, not feather,
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:34.480]  are the most successful ethnic group in America,
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:36.240]  way over whites.
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:38.240]  So if you wanna talk about privilege in America,
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:40.840]  then Indian Americans fit the criteria
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:44.000]  more than white people and a bunch of other races.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  Yeah, they're the 1% on average,
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.040]  they're the most successful of the Asian groups
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:52.480]  who sit six deep on top before even get to whites.
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:57.040]  And you go, that's good, by the way.
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:57.880]  I like that.
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:39:59.400]  I like Indians coming in here.
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:00.640]  They don't steal our jobs.
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:02.080]  They tend to create new businesses.
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:03.480]  By the way, almost all the Indians I know
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.040]  are Trump supporters.
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:07.680]  Yes, yes, they're not jihadists.
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:10.240]  Their religion blends nicely with Christianity.
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:12.600]  There's no sort of fifth column going on
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:15.600]  where they refuse to learn our laws or our language.
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.080]  They even get our humor.
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:19.400]  They even seem to get how to riff properly.
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:23.600]  So great asset, but stop complaining and whining.
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:26.720]  Groundskeeper Willie, see my parents, by the way.
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:29.960]  If you're Scotland, I grew up with an accent
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:32.600]  and I was bullied when I emigrated to Canada.
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.520]  And guess what I thought that was?
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:37.080]  Good, because I was getting in with the guys.
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:38.440]  I was getting bullied around.
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:39.880]  We were becoming a group.
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:42.360]  It was like an initiation into Canada.
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:45.120]  And within a week, I lost the time.
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:46.960]  And I said, hey, how's it going?
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:48.920]  Well, Maggie Long Clause is pregnant.
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:50.400]  And I was right in with the group.
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:51.880]  It's called assimilation.
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:53.440]  Get over it, you pussies.
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:57.680]  Of course you can have fat bastard as well, if you'd like.
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:01.080]  It's a fun accent.
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:02.560]  I don't think these people understand
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.200]  what we went through in the 70s.
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:07.960]  You would get an atomic wedgie for having glasses.
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:10.240]  Well, that's part of the world.
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:11.320]  And the idea that some groups
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:13.440]  can represent you and control all language
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:14.720]  so you don't get bullied.
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:16.880]  How about getting bullied by the thought police?
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:18.760]  Facebook told us, they said,
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:21.560]  don't even use the word tranny,
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:24.400]  even in a positive light, or you're just banned.
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:26.080]  They're like, that is the God word.
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:27.960]  And once I don't use that,
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:29.520]  well, then now I can't use any word.
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:30.840]  And the truth is, I don't need to preface,
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:32.320]  I don't care what you're doing sexually.
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:33.400]  I'm a libertarian.
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:35.680]  But then I should be able to say whatever I want.
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:37.320]  I mean, look how it's ruining comedy.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:41.880]  Everything's being ruined by these really Nazi thought police.
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:44.000]  And they're just throwing darts at a board
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.280]  when they decide who are these coveted groups.
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:49.120]  Trans, I remember trannies from the 90s.
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:51.080]  We used to go to this big gay rave
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:52.560]  called black and blue in Montreal
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:53.920]  because there's tons of chicks around.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:54.760]  Lots of faggots.
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:56.240]  Of course, that's where all the hot chicks are.
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:59.080]  Yeah, we would prey on these girls who were bored
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:00.120]  because no one was hitting on them
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:01.160]  and we didn't have any competition.
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:04.160]  It is true that the wildest chicks are faggots.
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:05.000]  I married one.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:05.840]  It goes, it's great.
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.160]  I highly recommend it.
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:10.320]  But I remember the trannies would be off in a corner
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.840]  and they were always on special K or mess
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:15.120]  and they would vomit on the ground and slip in.
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:17.320]  Exactly, why are they always vomiting?
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:18.160]  They would be harassed too.
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:19.000]  If you mess with a tranny,
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.160]  they'd take out their shoes and they would hospitalize you.
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:24.120]  Oh, what is it about trannies are always like the toughest dudes.
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:26.360]  Yes, yeah, because they got to fight every day
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:28.560]  with all the lunatics that surround them.
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:30.880]  We have a lot in common with the old school tranny
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:33.480]  come to think of it for both hardened brawlers.
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:36.920]  And again, everything we just said is true.
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:39.120]  Everybody knows it, who's here, been around.
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:41.720]  And then it's supposedly hateful to say
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:43.520]  that it was well known back in the day
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:44.920]  that if you went to a rave,
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.360]  there'd be a bunch of hot chicks
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:48.400]  and then you can pick up three of them if you wanted to.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:50.160]  I mean, I just read that once.
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:51.320]  I just read that.
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:52.160]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.000]  We'll gather them again.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:53.840]  Let's stay with us.

[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:02.840]  It's time to start assisting the body

[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:48.160]  It is an act of standing up when you spread the links,
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:50.000]  the articles, and buy products from us.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.960]  And then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.

[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:08.800]  And when we sell products at this lower price,
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:10.960]  we've got to sell a lot of it from the operation.
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:12.600]  But I know the products are so good,
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:14.840]  that even though we make a very small profit on each item,
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:16.880]  you'll like them and then order more, especially things
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:20.200]  like the coffee that's so good, or our toothpaste,
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:23.400]  or our mouthwash, or our vitamin mineral fusion,
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:24.400]  fruit punch drink.
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:27.040]  It's got all the amino acids and multivitamins.
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:28.800]  Our probiotic, all of it.

[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:42.960]  You sign up for auto-ship.
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:45.000]  We're losing like $6, $7 on this.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:45.840]  That doesn't matter.
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:47.040]  I just want you to see how great it is.
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:48.600]  We are now four and a half hours
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:51.200]  into the worldwide broadcast, America Rebirth,
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:53.600]  and Renaissance was so much coming up today.
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:59.880]  Protect Your Skin with SPF 30 sunscreen lotion
[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:01.760]  by EmRick's Essentials.

[01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:08.920]  whenever you need sun protection.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:11.160]  We source ingredients from nature,
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:14.800]  producing a product free of harmful chemicals and toxins.
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:18.480]  This natural lotion contains 21% zinc oxide,
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:20.880]  which is the largest particle size used,
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:23.160]  and we do not use nanoparticles.
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:26.680]  The larger the particle, the safer it is for your body.
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:29.000]  The organic oils help hydrate the skin,
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.800]  leaving it nice and smooth.

[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:55.480]  and learn more about the new SPF 30 sunscreen lotion.
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:47:07.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:16.920]  You're listening to the Antidote for fake news.
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:19.680]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:22.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:24.760]  Yeah, and again, this is our guest.
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:25.720]  And then in the next hour,
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:27.400]  I intend to cover news up with the phones up,
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:30.720]  ladies and gentlemen, but seriously,
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:32.240]  I don't need to sit here and preface this.
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:34.000]  I was not brought up to be racist.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.880]  I was not brought up to be against people
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:38.000]  that were gay or straight or whatever.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.200]  And to me, people's sexuality was like one aspect,
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:43.200]  like they played baseball or, you know,
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:45.640]  they were a carpenter or they were into music.
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:49.120]  It was just like, I'm not sexually obsessed.
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:51.720]  You know, unless it's 10 o'clock at night
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:53.520]  and I'm getting bed with my wife or whatever.
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:57.280]  And then to just see this continued obsession
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:00.320]  with sex, sex, sex, it's what perverts do.
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:03.520]  And then to just see everything territorialized
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:05.120]  in every racial or cultural group
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:07.200]  and now they're saying math is racist.
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:09.600]  And, you know, years ago, Halloween's racist.
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:12.720]  And then setting up Play-Doh and crayons
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:14.560]  for people at college that get upset
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:16.160]  when they see a pocket constitution.
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:19.760]  We all laugh at it, but mental illness
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:22.600]  is being induced on these people.
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:24.760]  And I think overwhelmingly in a lot of documents show
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:29.760]  by design, Gavin, what set this system up,
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:33.560]  this perpetual motion machine?
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:35.200]  And where does it really end?
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:36.680]  Because I asked you this earlier
[01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:38.280]  and you kind of didn't get to it.
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:42.120]  What goes past, kind of like spinal tap, you know,
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:44.120]  10, why not just make it go to 10?
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:45.240]  Well, because it goes to 11.
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:47.560]  What's past 11?
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:51.040]  Now that they're dangerous, angry ex-girlfriend,
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:53.120]  what comes after that?
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:54.640]  Rights in the streets.
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:56.360]  Massive, I mean, we've already seen this.
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:59.080]  We've got a taste of this when Trump was elected.
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:00.000]  They were delirious.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.880]  They were attacking people in MAGA hats,
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:04.680]  attacking 50% of the population
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:06.600]  because they believe this narrative
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:08.240]  that they created themselves
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:10.960]  that everyone who doesn't agree with them is Hitler.
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:15.320]  And they have no interest in hashing out the nuance there.
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:17.560]  It's black and white and they have to fight.
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:19.440]  And these people have never been in a fight.
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:20.800]  They laugh at the cops.
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.600]  They shove cops and you go,
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:24.440]  have you been out of your house before?
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:25.600]  Have you been outside before?
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:27.840]  You can't shove a cop, dummy.
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:29.720]  No matter what has happened,
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:31.680]  the most you can do is sieve
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:33.160]  and hope to get justice later.
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:36.920]  But I think it might be a genetically white trait,
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:39.880]  you know, this sort of self debasement, this self hatred.
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:41.480]  I was walking into my bar the other day
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:43.080]  and I think people are starting to know who I am
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:44.040]  in my neighborhood.
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:45.160]  And so all the white people went,
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:46.680]  oh my God, that's the guy, blah, blah, blah.
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:48.240]  And then there was two black guys at the end
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:49.080]  and they just looked at me.
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:51.240]  They had no clue who I was.
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:54.200]  And I thought, these white people are sort of offended
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.880]  on behalf of gays, minorities, trans.
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:00.120]  But the gays, minorities, trans, the black people,
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:01.520]  they're not part of this thing.
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:03.320]  It's sort of like, let me give you another example.
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:05.760]  I worked with this Russian guy and I said,
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:08.240]  I saw this kid wearing a hammer and a sickle
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:09.920]  and that must drive you nuts.
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:10.800]  You must hate that.
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:13.840]  So here I am getting mad on his behalf and he looks at me
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:16.680]  and he goes, why would I give a crap
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:18.480]  about a hammer and a sickle?
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:20.600]  I am so glad to be out of that place.
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:23.600]  If someone wants to wear a communist pin, good for them.
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:25.040]  I could not care less.
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:28.880]  And I thought, here I am, mad at this person on his behalf
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:30.240]  and he doesn't care.
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:32.040]  There's something about white people,
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:34.840]  affluent middle-class white people where we're just like,
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:36.120]  can I have your problems?
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:38.120]  I wanna do your problems for you.
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:40.200]  Well, isn't it that we got rid of Christianity
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:42.400]  in some of the extreme oppressive forms of it
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:45.640]  and now the grandkids and children of very oppressive people
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:48.120]  that thought going to the bathroom was a sin,
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:49.920]  they now are just telling everybody else
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:51.360]  everything else is a sin.
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:54.360]  And they're basically the same kind of twisted Puritans
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:56.280]  that wanna beat everybody over the head.
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:57.120]  Exactly.
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:58.800]  Well, Jim Goat calls them church ladies.
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:01.080]  Paul Joseph Watson, great video out now
[01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:02.760]  called the sexual Puritans.
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:04.720]  They didn't abandon Christianity.
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:06.360]  They just changed its name.
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:08.160]  And now their religion is atheism
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:09.680]  and telling people what to do
[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:11.840]  and looking down at everyone.
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:14.160]  I mean, they're really like the Catholic church
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:18.360]  way before we had all this sort of a 2.0 version.
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:20.480]  They want the Bible to be in Latin
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:21.880]  so that people can't read it.
[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:23.040]  That's who they are.
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:25.840]  They're really these old school aristocrats
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.800]  and they're un-American at the end of the day
[01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:30.720]  cause America was founded to get away from all that stuff.
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:34.760]  So much is going on, so many questions.
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:37.480]  What do you think about Trump 11 months in?
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:38.920]  I mean, as his presidency,
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:41.640]  it appears starts to become really successful.
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:43.880]  They go in an even more hysterical spiral
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:45.720]  but maybe we're seeing signs of sanity.
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:47.520]  Donna Brazil turning against him,
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:50.600]  a CNN host, Wolf Blitzer, many others.
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:52.920]  Chris Hayes turning against him, MSNBC.
[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:55.320]  And now we see the real canary in the coal mine
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:57.000]  killing their ratings,
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.280]  absolutely dedicated to going after Trump.
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:01.240]  Now, Saturday Night Live comes out
[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:02.640]  and says blow up the whole party.
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:03.800]  They're evil, they're bad.
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:04.640]  Get rid of them.
[01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:05.760]  Donna Brazil's a hero.
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:09.520]  Is that an attempted makeover a few days late?
[01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:12.480]  They're imploding, but will they implosion ever end?
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:14.800]  It's sort of like an animal house where that guy's saying,
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:18.280]  everyone become and everyone keeps running past them.
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:21.320]  I don't think that they'd even notice that they're on fire.
[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:23.040]  They just keep getting nuttier and nuttier.
[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:24.760]  And by the way, you ask where it ends?
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:26.960]  When Trump gets reelected,
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:28.840]  you thought 2008 was a meltdown.
[01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:31.800]  I mean, sorry, you thought last year was a meltdown.
[01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:34.040]  The next, after he wins in three years,
[01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:37.880]  you're going to see total and utter mania riding the streets
[01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:40.240]  cause they're going to get crazier and crazier
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:43.760]  as time goes on because Trump keeps getting better and better.
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:48.360]  800,000 jobs, Dow soaring, none of these controversies are true.
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:51.240]  All the racist hate crimes turn out to be hoaxes.
[01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:53.880]  The more they try to find problems with them,
[01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:56.080]  the more we realize what a great president it is.
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:58.880]  And instead of them going, oh geez, I guess I was wrong.
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:00.040]  They're incapable of that.
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:02.800]  So the crazy girlfriend just keeps going crazier
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:04.480]  and crazier and crazier.
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:07.880]  That's the crazy thing about it is that
[01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:11.480]  they never admit they're wrong.
[01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:14.640]  I mean, that's true insanity.
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:18.320]  And they just make up more and more fantastical lies.
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:19.960]  And they see like all of America
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:23.120]  as like a real Dungeons and Dragons game
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:25.160]  and like Trump's the demon lord.
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:26.240]  And they've got to kill him.
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:28.160]  And you're like, dude, this isn't real.
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:31.640]  That's not how, I mean, a scientist has a hypothesis
[01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:33.800]  like life needs light.
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:35.880]  So if something is in a totally dark place,
[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:36.720]  there can't be light.
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:39.800]  And that was an accepted belief in science for decades.
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:41.120]  I'm going to say hundreds of years.
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:43.240]  And then they started finding life forms embedded
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:46.320]  within rock that had never seen the light of day,
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:47.240]  but they were alive.
[01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:48.160]  And what did scientists do?
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:49.400]  Did they have a meltdown?
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:50.680]  Did they have November 8th?
[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:52.400]  We're going to scream at the sky.
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:53.560]  Did they smash windows?
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:56.920]  They went, oh, recalibrate.
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:54:00.520]  Turns out you can have life without light.
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:01.560]  That's what a scientist does.
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:03.720]  That's what any normal intelligent person does.
[01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:06.040]  Intelligence is being wrong
[01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:07.080]  because you're improving.
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:08.080]  It's like lifting weights.
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:09.440]  You're tearing away at the muscles.
[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:12.480]  So they rebuild stronger, but these people can't be wrong.
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:13.560]  And that makes them dumber.
[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:15.840]  And they just keep getting stupider and stupider.
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:17.800]  And they go to college and they come out dumber
[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:18.800]  than when they went in.
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:19.960]  They don't want to evolve.
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:22.400]  I heard Sonny Johnson over at Breitbart.
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:24.920]  And she said, look, if a guy gets arrested,
[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:26.120]  he's in the hood, he goes to jail.
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:27.720]  He shouldn't be allowed to have a gun again.
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:29.120]  And then this guy called up and he goes, look,
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:29.960]  I'm a family man.
[01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:32.320]  I did my two years for having a legal gun,
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:34.320]  but my wife now can't have a gun in the house.
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:35.720]  And we live in the hood.
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:37.440]  And she goes, after she thinks about it for a while,
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:38.640]  she goes, you know what?
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:39.840]  You're right, I'm wrong.
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:41.600]  I changed my mind about that.
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:44.200]  You should, after you do your time, be able to buy a gun,
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:46.720]  especially if you're a dad in the hood.
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:48.000]  She's smarter now.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.760]  She's evolved, but the left devolves.
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:53.040]  And that might be why they love Islam so much.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:55.720]  Because with all this inbreeding and the first cousins,
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:57.160]  they seem to be the only culture in the world
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:00.960]  that manages to go backwards in time and devolve.
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:05.960]  It's true, wow, Gavin, pulling back from this,
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:08.520]  what's their ace in the hole?
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:13.200]  Because they have created a lot of really weak dependent
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:15.640]  people that are so stupid, they don't know what's going on.
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:17.120]  Then you've got kind of the pseudo-intellectuals
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:19.520]  that believe they're the intellectual elite.
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:20.920]  That's why they're so upset at us.
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:24.120]  Taking back control from them, just for the sake of sanity.
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:28.120]  I think when you talk about them wanting to blow up
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:31.000]  the whole system to get back at reality,
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.080]  I think that's really their ace in the hole.
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:35.600]  And I think we better be ready to deal with them.
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:38.520]  Hey, look, our ace in the hole is free speech
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:39.680]  and getting the word out.
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:41.560]  That this isn't about trans kids,
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:43.320]  and this isn't about refugees.
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:45.360]  This is about sabotage.
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:48.080]  The reason they're normaling pedophilia right now
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:50.360]  is not because they think children are sexual,
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:51.720]  just because they want to wreck stuff.
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:53.480]  They want to see Rome burn.
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:55.640]  They want to burn America to the ground,
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:57.600]  and they have no plan B.
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:59.200]  So we need to get the word out.
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:01.040]  As far as their strengths go,
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:04.200]  their strengths are that we tend to be weak.
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:06.200]  We haven't had a war in a long time.
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:07.720]  We tend to have gone soft.
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:10.080]  So when the crazy ex-girlfriend throws the brick
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:11.400]  through the window at your new job,
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:12.960]  and the manager goes, sorry, buddy,
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:14.440]  you're too expensive to keep here.
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:16.000]  I got to keep replacing the glass.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.200]  The employee just tends to go, yeah, okay.
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:22.760]  Walks out of the place like Eeyore or something
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:24.560]  and says, that's life.
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:25.800]  We just keep getting these people
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:28.400]  that are too easily intimidated.
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:29.240]  You're absolutely right.
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:31.480]  We're out of time, but have you seen the footage
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:32.920]  of Mall of America yesterday
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:34.960]  when the knifing attack happened from the Somali?
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:37.480]  And it's like 95% women in burkas,
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:40.720]  and looks like just you're in Somaliland?
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:43.280]  It's like P. Diddy always said,
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:45.320]  mo Muslims, mo problems.
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:49.520]  What's the left's plan with this?
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:51.800]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:55.680]  Sabotage, dude, you found out that there was smallpox
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:58.000]  if the left found out that Republicans
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.920]  were buying smallpox blankets,
[01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:01.440]  they would be thrilled, they would donate.
[01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:03.040]  If you had a fund that you said,
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:04.680]  I'm gonna make smallpox blankets
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:05.800]  and say Trump on them,
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:08.480]  I guarantee you liberals would support that.
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:11.560]  They want us dead, as Ann Coulter said.
[01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:13.080]  They don't want to negotiate.
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:14.600]  They don't want to find middle ground.
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:16.960]  They want total and utter annihilation.
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:20.480]  And the poor Somalis from their own wreck country,
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:21.560]  they're the dynamite.
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:23.640]  Dude, I've been to Israel.
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:25.680]  Muslims say in Israel, they go,
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:28.080]  we're happier here in Israel, living in Israel
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:29.920]  than we are living on the other side of the wall.
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:31.280]  We're safer under Jewish rule
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:32.760]  than we are under Muslim rule.
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:35.360]  No one likes living with Muslims, not even Muslims.
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:38.440]  But now they've gotten here politically correct.
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:40.520]  Now they do have the ethos to be Muslim.
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:42.720]  They finally found their pride with the left.
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:43.920]  Yeah, McGinnis, thanks for joining us.
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:45.560]  Wow, stay with us.
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:48.320]  I want to plow into all of this.
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:51.120]  But I'm gonna spend a few minutes here first,
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:53.000]  just encouraging listeners to understand
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.320]  that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:02.320]  or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com,
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:05.560]  you are funding the revolution.
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:07.640]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear.
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:10.520]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products
[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:11.680]  at infowarstore.com.
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:12.800]  I don't want to thank everybody that has,

[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:18.720]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine.
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:21.320]  I think you cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:23.960]  We've got the best mouthwash signed by Dr. Jones.
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:26.680]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.

[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:38.400]  and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:39.480]  And that's who they are.
[01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:41.000]  And they know we know who they are.
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.160]  And they're coming back against us,
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:43.360]  so we need your support.
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:49.040]  I am very proud to announce the introduction

[01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:57.320]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum

[01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:04.880]  that have been proven to improve overall digestion
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:08.440]  and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:11.840]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion
[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:15.040]  live and active cultures from over 23 different
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:18.640]  probiotic strains that are known to support digestion
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:20.280]  and intestinal function.
[01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:22.520]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:27.000]  to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:14.080]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:16.080]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:18.080]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:20.080]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:22.080]  Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:24.080]  Because they know that these are legitimate news organizations.
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:26.080]  And at that point somebody decides
[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:28.080]  they're going to scroll past that
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:30.080]  and go find Alex Jones,
[02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:32.080]  so if they're looking for him,
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:34.080]  let's begin with any of his.
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:36.080]  His name is Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:38.080]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:40.080]  There's a lot of controversy around this network
[02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:42.080]  showing for example.
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:44.080]  It's time to stop submitting in this charity.
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:46.080]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved.
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:48.080]  I heard that on Alex Jones.
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:50.080]  Infowars went even further.
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:52.080]  Infowars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:54.080]  We are in an information war
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:56.080]  and we are losing that war.
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:58.080]  Nobody can dispute the fact
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:00.080]  that you're a great man.
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:02.080]  Infowars.com.
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:04.080]  Infowars comes to mind.
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:06.080]  Infowars.
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:08.080]  Right now the war is the Infowars.
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:10.080]  Can you watch Infowars?
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:12.080]  Infowars.
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:14.080]  I got a chair going.
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:16.080]  Looking at widely reported
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:18.080]  information from Infowars.
[02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:20.080]  Infowars.
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:22.080]  Infowars.com.
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:24.080]  I want freedom! That's what I want!
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:26.080]  And that's what you should want!
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:28.080]  Hello, this is Hank Hill
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:30.080]  and I'm telling you what
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:44.080]  we need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:48.080]  I saw a video on
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:50.080]  Thursday night
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:52.080]  of Sean Parker,
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:54.080]  the former president
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:56.080]  of Facebook,
[02:01:56.080 --> 02:01:58.080]  legendary hacker,
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:00.080]  computer programmer, you name it.
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:02.080]  I got to meet once here in Austin.
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:04.080]  And he was saying,
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:06.080]  Facebook
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:08.080]  targets and exploits your weaknesses.
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:10.080]  It targets and exploits your psychology.
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:12.080]  It makes you depressed by design
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:14.080]  and it's very, very evil
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:16.080]  and we consciously knew this when we did it.
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:18.080]  That thought process
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:20.080]  was all about how we consume
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:22.080]  as much of your time
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:24.080]  and conscious attention
[02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:26.080]  as possible.
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:28.080]  It means that we need to
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:30.080]  give you a little dopamine hit
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:32.080]  every once in a while
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:34.080]  because someone liked or commented
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:36.080]  on a photo or a post or whatever.
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:38.080]  That's going to get you to contribute
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:40.080]  more content
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:42.080]  and that's going to get you
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:44.080]  more likes and comments.
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:46.080]  It's a social validation feedback loop
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:48.080]  that it's exactly
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:50.080]  the kind of thing
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:52.080]  that a hacker like myself would come up with
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:54.080]  because you're exploiting a vulnerability
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:56.080]  in human psychology.
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:02:58.080]  And I think that
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:00.080]  the inventors,
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:02.080]  creators
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:04.080]  and it's me, it's Mark,
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:06.080]  it's the
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:08.080]  Kevin's sister in Instagram, it's all of these people
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:10.080]  understood this
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:12.080]  consciously
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:14.080]  and we did it anyway.
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:16.080]  But to have
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:18.080]  Sean Parker
[02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:20.080]  multi-billionaire founder
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:22.080]  of Napster, one of the co-founders
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:24.080]  of Facebook and so many other big endeavors
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:26.080]  who was so
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:28.080]  crazed when I met him,
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:30.080]  he wasn't on drugs, it was natural.
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:32.080]  Super intelligence
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:34.080]  that he just walked up to me and went
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:36.080]  Alex Jones, I can't believe you're here.
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:38.080]  He was all he goes, I'm leaving
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:40.080]  and just ran down the hall
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:42.080]  out the door
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:44.080]  at a party I was invited to by a rock star.
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:46.080]  And this is
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:48.080]  a funny little story because I said
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:50.080]  well I don't know what that guy's problem is
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:52.080]  he ran for me like
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:54.080]  Casper the friendly ghost, somebody sees a ghost
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:56.080]  they run out the door so hard they just put a hole
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:58.080]  through the door and there's a silhouette of their body
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:00.080]  but I don't need to believe
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:02.080]  Sean Parker.
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:04.080]  I read documents 20 years
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:06.080]  ago and 10 years ago and 5 years ago
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:08.080]  I talked to former CIA section
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:10.080]  chiefs about this that were at MIT
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:12.080]  in the 70s. I
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:14.080]  did my research because the elite acts like
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:16.080]  you're all idiots or I'm an idiot
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:18.080]  and we won't actually go read what's been written in
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:20.080]  published books by them
[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:22.080]  people ask how do I know all this stuff
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:24.080]  why does everything keep coming true I talk about
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:26.080]  why does the media create
[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:28.080]  all these fake things I didn't talk about
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:30.080]  to attribute to me to try to make people not tune in
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:32.080]  it's because I actually went and read
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:34.080]  what they said they were going to build
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:36.080]  and here's the bad news
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:38.080]  most of it they've been able to do
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:40.080]  the good news is we now know they mean
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:42.080]  what they're saying we can stop them
[02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:44.080]  we have the intel because a long-term
[02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:46.080]  program like this can be stopped
[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:48.080]  and you're aware of it even in its final
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:50.080]  20% or so
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:52.080]  so
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:56.080]  you go to infowarstore.com

[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:46.080]  mama
[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:51.080]  When we run around screaming, we love Satan, we wanna eat babies.
[02:06:53.080 --> 02:06:55.080]  I have them on video.
[02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:57.080]  I fucking love Satan so fucking cute.
[02:06:57.080 --> 02:06:59.080]  I kill my kids.
[02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:02.080]  Here is in the creepy with six of men.
[02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:06.080]  He came, he saw, he died.
[02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:10.080]  She sleeps in the same room with that creepy with a woman
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:13.080]  whose mother wears her foot overhead.
[02:07:13.080 --> 02:07:17.080]  That woman number one is ugly.
[02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:21.080]  Imagine how bad she smells, man.
[02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:24.080]  I'm told her and Obama just stink.
[02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:30.080]  Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:35.080]  There's a guy on the radio who apparently trumps on the show frequently.
[02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:37.080]  He said me and Hillary are demons.
[02:07:37.080 --> 02:07:40.080]  Said we smell like sulfur. Ain't that something?
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:44.080]  I have never seen or smelled any woman like that, ever.
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:46.080]  People are telling me she smells.
[02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:48.080]  Who could not notice someone who smelled that bad?
[02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:52.080]  In a roof and by a part there's a darkness
[02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:55.080]  hobbling round from a path to a rose.
[02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:59.080]  A spirit gets close to that evil and I feel it go
[02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:04.080]  ah, ah, ah.
[02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:07.080]  We'll stuff ourselves in a crap.
[02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:11.080]  We don't even know it's headed south rising up against
[02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:14.080]  the millions of pointed people.
[02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:19.080]  If the fair was to happen, I'm so pissed.
[02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:24.080]  We're going to stare at your daughter at the mall.
[02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:40.080]  Oh, my.
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:43.080]  Well, that's the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:46.080]  We were halfway into that video and it just could put out.
[02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:49.080]  I thought my audio went out in my ear.
[02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:54.080]  But I guess that's that new special version we just got of that song, isn't it?
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:58.080]  That's how a lot of those new special versions work.
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:09:01.080]  What's that?
[02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:04.080]  You were saying something to me?
[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:09.080]  No, go ahead, Matt. Tell me what you were going to say.
[02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:15.080]  We got the rest of the song. Here it is, folks.
[02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:17.080]  That's even better.
[02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:19.080]  I was watching Fox News.
[02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:24.080]  This is like some of the best footage we've ever had right here from that town of Minnesota.
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:28.080]  And they had the Fox News host. This is the fair and balance channel going.
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:30.080]  Donald Trump really stepped in at this time.
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:35.080]  He said it was a bombing before it had officially been called a bombing and Hillary's on him
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:43.080]  and she's got some really good points.
[02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:46.080]  In a moment, I'm going to play a special report before we go to break and come back
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:50.080]  and open the phones up and take your phone calls titled,
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:56.080]  Trump Coup Rollout Criticized on the House Floor.
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:09:58.080]  And it's very, very important.
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:05.080]  Since the computer choked up and we weren't able to play the video,
[02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:11.080]  I talked about Somalis stabbing and killing people in malls and other places
[02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:13.080]  on about a weekly basis in the United States.
[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:17.080]  Now, usually the talking point that's given the police is,
[02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:19.080]  we love our Somalis. We love our Muslims too.
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:21.080]  Oh, they're so good. Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:23.080]  That's actually a quote.
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:30.080]  And so I set it on air and then folks took my voice and manipulated it and made it a song like it was a joke.
[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:37.080]  So I usually don't even get to the latest Somalis stabbing or shooting at a church or whatever.
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:40.080]  But I just thought today we would do that.
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:44.080]  But by today it was already memory hold. It was kind of like what?
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:45.080]  There's a song about Somalis.
[02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:50.080]  And then I think they made a new version today that was just so fabulous that you just saw.
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:55.080]  But hey, it doesn't matter because I love my Somalis.
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:56.080]  I love my Muslims too.
[02:10:56.080 --> 02:10:58.080]  Oh, they're so good. Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:07.080]  But the toll free number to join us on air is 877-789-ALEX-877-789-ALEX is the number to join us.
[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:12.080]  And I haven't gotten into U.S. news, political news, Judge Roy Moore news.
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:24.080]  One of those classic C.I. told you so stories because here it is in the news today.
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:27.080]  Official Dawn of the EU Army.
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:31.080]  Russell signs off a military plan and hails historic day without the U.K.
[02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:36.080]  And says they're going to invade countries that try to pull out now kind of like Spain's doing to Catalonia.
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:39.080]  That's out of the express.co.uk.
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:41.080]  That's 2017.
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:49.080]  We've got articles 2016 and 2015 and others where we told you about the secret army.
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:53.080]  And they even had articles in the news saying, look at Jones and his fake news.
[02:11:53.080 --> 02:12:01.080]  The Germans are launching a secret army via the EU just like they did, violating the Versailles Treaty in the 30s.
[02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:04.080]  And they're doing it again, a secret army.
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:06.080]  I'm not bashing Germans themselves.
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:08.080]  I'm part German.
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:14.080]  The point is that it's going on.
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:16.080]  And we told you it was coming.
[02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:18.080]  And now here's the EU Army that says we try to leave.
[02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:22.080]  They'll just take over with their EU Army, which is called martial law.
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:24.080]  It's called invasion.
[02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:31.080]  It's called World War II, part two, part two of two.
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:34.080]  European Union Army set for creation.
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:38.080]  UK to fund despite Brexit.
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:40.080]  Clifford Cunningham gives you the rest of the story.
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:44.080]  So you get today's news a year early.
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:47.080]  November 22nd, 2016.
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:49.080]  That's a little less than a year.
[02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:51.080]  Look at that.
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:57.080]  You get today's news 360 days early.
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:12:59.080]  Look right here.
[02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:01.080]  It's in the news today.
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:05.080]  It's official, dawn of the EU Army.
[02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:07.080]  We told you about 10 years ago.
[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:14.080]  So if you ask why they hate us for all of my issues, we're fearless.
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:16.080]  We're not pedophiles.
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:18.080]  We don't worship Satan.
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:19.080]  We want you to have a great life.
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:20.080]  We want a great life, by the way.
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:22.080]  Try to run our life.
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:24.080]  We'll fight you.
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:26.080]  And we're here to fight.
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:28.080]  We're here to not roll over.
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:30.080]  We're not taking it laying down.
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:32.080]  And that's the end of it.
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:33.080]  We don't care what you do to us.
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:35.080]  We're coming after you.
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:43.080]  So we're like heat seeking missiles or radar guided.
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:47.080]  We hone in on your radar or your heat signal.
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:54.080]  So when you're firing at us, that's what we hone in on.
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:14:00.080]  We try to dodge what the projectiles were coming in as they're flying past.
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:05.080]  But it really doesn't matter because if you hit us, that just makes more missiles hone in.
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:09.080]  And then form in the big failings.
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:11.080]  And it's just coming, coming.
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:15.080]  And they can see it and they know it and they can feel the will.
[02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:18.080]  And they can feel the destiny.
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:21.080]  And they know that we're not going to give up.
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:23.080]  They know that we're not going to back down.
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:25.080]  They know that we're committed.
[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:28.080]  They're pure Satan worshiping pedophiles and criminals.
[02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:30.080]  They have their purity.
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:33.080]  We have our purity.
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:40.080]  And that's why they always try to keep us asleep and then suppress us while we were asleep to get their dirty deeds done there.
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:52.080]  But now they've got a whole nother can of worms, kettle of fish, car full of clowns.
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:55.080]  They got a big problem.
[02:14:55.080 --> 02:15:04.080]  And it's just going to get worse because they've had generations mesmerized by the dumb dumb tube, mesmerized by the smartphones.
[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:21.080]  But see, a large contingent, a large segment, a large remnant, a large community, a people of every color, but all one human race,
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:31.080]  who have a spirit that wants freedom, are becoming stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger under the pressure.
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:36.080]  Many are becoming screen sickness smart phone zombies.
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:40.080]  I don't know if I coined that 10 years ago or was it Mark Dice? It doesn't matter.
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:43.080]  Now Wikipedia says it's a term, so it's real.

[02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:27.080]  I'll be honest with you.
[02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:33.080]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thank you for joining us.
[02:20:33.080 --> 02:20:44.080]  I feel guilty on this broadcast today that I have not spent more time on this or been more upset.
[02:20:44.080 --> 02:20:54.080]  And then I love the leftist already on Infowars.com saying, Alex, you're a libertarian. Why are you being big at it?
[02:20:54.080 --> 02:21:01.080]  I was reading. I've got a computer right over here. I've got my little smartphone, smaller computer, smaller screen.
[02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:07.080]  And I was reading comments in the article in the video by Millie Weaver.
[02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:13.080]  Drag Queen Festival at Austin promotes early sexualization of children, gender confusion.
[02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:18.080]  I mean, that's a totally true headline, a TT.
[02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:36.080]  And we got stuff we haven't even put out because it's police department type stuff.
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:50.080]  And then we know we're going to be attacked for saying, hey, man, it's not good to have a guy completely naked except for glitter glued to his member.
[02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:56.080]  It's one thing people go down to Cancun for spring break and they're all above 18 and the women put glitter on the guys doing your run around the beach.
[02:21:56.080 --> 02:22:00.080]  I mean, you're an adult. People can morally say that's wrong if they want to.
[02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:06.080]  You know, you better watch out, better wear a condom, but you're adults.
[02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:12.080]  Millie Weaver and Gavin Wentz go down to this thing that's open to the public at a hotel.
[02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:21.080]  And I mean, it's naked men walking around with glitter glued to their, their Johnson.
[02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:31.080]  And then you got men on their knees, shaking their hips with little kids coming up and giving them $5 bills and $10 bills.
[02:22:31.080 --> 02:22:36.080]  And they hide behind what you're not anti drag queen.
[02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:39.080]  You're not anti gay, are you?
[02:22:39.080 --> 02:22:44.080]  And again, we're the open free West where we don't kill gays.
[02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:50.080]  I literally don't hate people for their sexual persuasion, but I don't need to say, hey, before I show you,
[02:22:50.080 --> 02:23:00.080]  men on strip bars with little girls giving them money and little boys giving them money in some weird, weird conditioning operation.
[02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:07.080]  Let me just say I'm not anti. See how you have to preface that? That's wrong.
[02:23:07.080 --> 02:23:17.080]  Since I was aware of this video, I've been very upset because I have four children and I've seen the raw footage that I don't think we can put on air.
[02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:24.080]  I don't think what they had at a public event in a hotel ballroom in Austin, Texas.
[02:23:24.080 --> 02:23:32.080]  I can't put it on Facebook or Twitter or YouTube by their rules and by my own morality.
[02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:38.080]  I mean, you go to the beach, you drive it down the beach, you see a man and a woman arms around each other touching each other.
[02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:40.080]  You know, they're romantic.
[02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:49.080]  We got footage of six, seven, eight year old kids, man in romantic embraces with full grown men and all this weird sexual stuff with kids.
[02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:55.080]  And it is just they're pushing the envelope on purpose.
[02:23:55.080 --> 02:24:08.080]  And it's in a hotel. I mean, can you imagine it's it's and it's the fact that it's out in the open.
[02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:18.080]  And that people like Camille Paglia, who's a classical liberal and a lesbian has been criticized for saying you try to confuse a three year old sexuality or five year olds.
[02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:21.080]  That's child abuse. It is they're not involved in that.
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:24.080]  But they're going to have their natural proclivity.
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:31.080]  Somebody like a Catholic priest who put in or whatever to have sex with a six year old that is abusive and is pedophilia and is wrong.
[02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:41.080]  And all of these creepy ass cults of children and these in these in these shows, a lot of parents bring their kids there and want them to be famous.
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:55.080]  But then you've got a little boy dressed as a girl taking off their tutu and throwing it to the crowd and then getting money for people for being paid for sexually being provocative, which is beyond the gateway.
[02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:56.080]  It's how it begins.
[02:24:56.080 --> 02:25:03.080]  You know, you go to a topless bar to give women money to see what they like. And most of them are prostitutes.
[02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:11.080]  You're finding out their price. I mean, that's what topless bars are. Let's not lie about it.
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:16.080]  And I am not into the exploitation of women. So I am not into that.
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:18.080]  And I don't just say that as some term.
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:27.080]  I want a woman to really like me and really want me. I do not want to go in some 21st century version of a slave auction.
[02:25:27.080 --> 02:25:39.080]  And you got a woman up there on the slave platform, literally on a pole showing you her goods like they do in North Africa in Somalia or other areas today.
[02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:43.080]  And I get the hunted are the hunted.
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:46.080]  And the hunters are the hunted.
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:55.080]  I mean, I get a lot of the women are predatory, but creating that system makes a woman predatory when women are the opposite of that historically.
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:26:03.080]  It's a mess. It's a mess. It's a mess. It's a mess. It's a mess.
[02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:13.080]  Men having sex with women who they're not in love with dehumanizes and is empty and is bad, but your adults, you can do it.
[02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:21.080]  Children being brought in and do children doing strip teases for money.
[02:26:21.080 --> 02:26:32.080]  And children running up and giving men, rest as women, humping the ground money is an abomination by every yardstick.
[02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:38.080]  And it just shows the tolerance of America has gone way off the edge.
[02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:47.080]  Everyone's tolerance, but notice it's gotten so tolerant that the mentally ill left tells heterosexuals, you're bad.
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:49.080]  Nuclear families, you're bad.
[02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:51.080]  People they call straight or bad.
[02:26:51.080 --> 02:27:00.080]  Every show on Netflix is calling for communist revolution or every episode stranger things you name it is all anti nuclear family, anti male and female anti.
[02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:06.080]  And then they call the little girl that was 12 when they shot it now 13 the sexiest woman in Hollywood.
[02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:15.080]  I mean, it's just everything is about debasing the youth.
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:21.080]  And if I was a dark alien force trying to sabotage humanity, I would get into the seedstock.
[02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:24.080]  I would target the babies.
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:26.080]  And that's what they've done.
[02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:31.080]  And you've got these drugged out, crazy, poor, sad people.
[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:38.080]  Most of which are in the sex industry that are pranies and transvestites, transsexuals, all that.
[02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:43.080]  I mean, it's a meat grinder, highest level of suicide, highest level of depression, hormones.
[02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:51.080]  The whole thing started as a CIA tap a stock Institute program 40 years ago to see if they could really screw up humanity.
[02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:55.080]  I don't hate these people.
[02:27:55.080 --> 02:28:03.080]  They're victims, but just like a kid that was kidnapped when they were five at age 10, they're driving along the ice cream truck, learn other kids in the vehicle.
[02:28:03.080 --> 02:28:09.080]  They're now on the angler fish.
[02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:11.080]  They're the light.
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:16.080]  The young children or the young light that the angler fish hangs out in front.
[02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:20.080]  The other little fishies to swim up towards the white van.
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:26.080]  And if you want to see the mascot of the New World Order, it's pull up an angler fish, can we?
[02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:29.080]  The thing that should not be, but is it over 10,000 feet in the ocean.
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:35.080]  That evil satanic creature, the light of an angel right out front masquerading his angel light.
[02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:37.080]  It's cute. It's fun. It's liberal.
[02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:39.080]  Just come close and right there are the jaws.
[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:41.080]  Come on in.
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:42.080]  Come on in.

[02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:45.080]  Come on in.

[02:30:56.080 --> 02:30:59.080]  America is an information based civil war.
[02:30:59.080 --> 02:31:06.080]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:12.080]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:20.080]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:28.080]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism and pro-freedom who at the same time is tolerant.
[02:31:28.080 --> 02:31:33.080]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Geverson's classical liberalism.
[02:31:33.080 --> 02:31:35.080]  They are the anti-liberalists.
[02:31:35.080 --> 02:31:40.080]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends and promote freedom worldwide.

[02:32:30.080 --> 02:32:36.080]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products and this part is most important.

[02:32:52.080 --> 02:33:14.080]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:33:23.080 --> 02:33:26.080]  Alright, I'm going to your phone calls here, interspersing it with some other news.
[02:33:26.080 --> 02:33:31.080]  Man, you look at the classic racism being spewed by corporate media.
[02:33:31.080 --> 02:33:35.080]  It's meant to make white people racist.
[02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:39.080]  It's not going to work.
[02:33:39.080 --> 02:33:41.080]  But here's Daily Caller.
[02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:44.080]  Professor, it's not okay to be white.
[02:33:44.080 --> 02:33:47.080]  Because people are starting to come out and say, hey, it's okay to be white.
[02:33:47.080 --> 02:33:52.080]  Two weeks ago, I said we got new t-shirts coming out that say it's okay to be white.
[02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:56.080]  Then it says it's okay to be black, it's okay to be red, it's okay to be brown, it's okay to be pink.
[02:33:56.080 --> 02:33:59.080]  It's great to be human.
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:01.080]  So those t-shirts are coming out very, very soon.
[02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:04.080]  But this is just in the WikiLeaks.
[02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:06.080]  I keep going back to that, not for lack of news.
[02:34:06.080 --> 02:34:09.080]  I have too much new news and incredible stuff to cover.
[02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:14.080]  It's just they're in there in the Democratic Party saying we need race war.
[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:15.080]  We need culture war.
[02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:16.080]  That's all we've got.
[02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:18.080]  We've got to stop prosperity.
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:21.080]  We've got to keep people poor so we can run their lives.
[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:24.080]  That's evil.
[02:34:24.080 --> 02:34:29.080]  It's one thing if I got something and you want to take it away from me and then I crush you.
[02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:31.080]  I mean, I'll do that.
[02:34:31.080 --> 02:34:33.080]  I don't feel guilt about that.
[02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:40.080]  But if I went and tried to take something that was somebody else's or I was jealous of them or I wanted to make somebody low so I felt big,
[02:34:40.080 --> 02:34:45.080]  that doesn't make me feel big, that makes me feel small.
[02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:54.080]  Just watching the globalists getting mad at everybody who wants everybody to be successful makes me show upset.
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:56.080]  And I'm not going to sit here and virtue signal.
[02:34:56.080 --> 02:35:01.080]  Just for me, it's not virtue signaling.
[02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:03.080]  I told you back when it happened a month ago.
[02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:07.080]  It was so obvious the way the Air Force General rolled it out the way the media picked it up.
[02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:09.080]  Somebody said, you know, get out of here inward.
[02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:11.080]  It was all fake.
[02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:14.080]  And by the way, they've not prosecuted
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:18.080]  or gotten in trouble, the cadet that did it.
[02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:20.080]  And that's because that cadet didn't do it.
[02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:25.080]  Just like I said, back at the time I said if they catch them, they're going to blame it on a minority.
[02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:28.080]  I said, folks, it isn't a minority.
[02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:31.080]  Let me tell you how the globalists operate.
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:35.080]  You think a minority student really wants to go around and stir that up and do it?
[02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:36.080]  No.
[02:35:36.080 --> 02:35:39.080]  They want to belong.
[02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:40.080]  I've studied these cases.
[02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:42.080]  I've seen the M.O. the way the rollout came out.
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:48.080]  Sometimes individuals do false flags, but generally it's somebody above them and somebody who's already in trouble gets burned for it.
[02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:56.080]  But notice they won't say who did it.
[02:35:56.080 --> 02:36:02.080]  That's because they did it.
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:07.080]  And notice the media, and I said that on Friday and on Sunday and today, never attack me for it.
[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:12.080]  I've called out the general, the three-star general, and I think he did it.
[02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:13.080]  I know his past.
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:14.080]  I know who he is.
[02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:17.080]  And I also happen to have sources.
[02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:19.080]  So you're smart, aren't you, general?
[02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:24.080]  You didn't take the bait, did you, punk?
[02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:27.080]  I wish you'd take more bait.
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:33.080]  We'll get you, don't you worry.
[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:40.080]  Let's hear a few minutes of this fake of fakes with all his social engineer SJW, as most of them who are in on it,
[02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:47.080]  they want to call in this multi-racial group of red-blooded Americans or one race and beat them up with the head that they're racist,
[02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:49.080]  but they're not even thinking about it.
[02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:53.080]  They're actually scared because the group is unified.
[02:36:53.080 --> 02:36:58.080]  The WikiLeaks explains what we already knew in the Tabistock Institute and the CIA documents.
[02:36:58.080 --> 02:37:04.080]  They're upset that we're all syncing up and getting along. They don't know what to do.
[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:06.080]  So what does he do?
[02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:14.080]  He injects a bunch of race crap and doesn't think we couldn't tell that he was in the middle of the NFL scandal wanting to look like a hero
[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:17.080]  injecting themselves with their SJWs.
[02:37:17.080 --> 02:37:18.080]  Then we're going to your phone calls.
[02:37:18.080 --> 02:37:19.080]  Here it is.
[02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:26.080]  We have an opportunity here, 5,500 people in this room, to think about what we are as an institution.
[02:37:26.080 --> 02:37:32.080]  This is our institution and no one can take away our values.
[02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:36.080]  No one can write on a board and question our values.
[02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:38.080]  Look at how they're glaring at that at the military.
[02:37:38.080 --> 02:37:39.080]  No one can take that away from us.
[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:40.080]  The contractors are.
[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:41.080]  Look at this guy.
[02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:48.080]  So just in case you're unclear on where I stand on this topic, I'm going to leave you with my most important part today.
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:51.080]  Just in case you're not clear, I'm the hero.
[02:37:51.080 --> 02:37:58.080]  I'm the hero. If you can't take someone with dignity and respect, then you need to get out.
[02:37:58.080 --> 02:38:00.080]  You need to get out. You did it! You did it! You did it!
[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:07.080]  If you can't take someone from another gender, whether that's a man or a woman, with dignity and respect, then you need to get out.
[02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:09.080]  Hit Poss.
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:20.080]  You need to get out and you can't take a man or woman with dignity and respect. You need to get out.
[02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:31.440]  God, they are so upset by the Christian ethos of ending slavery, ending segregation.
[02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:32.440]  They hijacked.
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:33.440]  They took control.
[02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:35.400]  Now they want to try to reintegrate it under political practice.
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:38.120]  It's not working.
[02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:40.000]  Polls show racism is at all time lows.
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:41.240]  People are coming together.
[02:38:41.240 --> 02:38:42.840]  They don't know what to do.
[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:45.480]  Everybody's sinking up right now in the group collective.
[02:38:45.480 --> 02:38:47.280]  They want us all hating each other.
[02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:52.040]  He's been proven so that we don't sink up in the big ethos, in the big group collective,
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:53.200]  in the big group consciousness.
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:54.640]  It's real.
[02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:56.360]  The big internet.
[02:38:56.360 --> 02:38:57.360]  And they are panicking.
[02:38:57.360 --> 02:38:58.360]  What do we do?
[02:38:58.360 --> 02:38:59.360]  It's in the way he likes.
[02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:00.360]  Get in there.
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:01.480]  Keep them desperate.
[02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:02.480]  Make them fight with each other.
[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:03.480]  They're coming together.
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:04.480]  What do we do?
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:05.480]  Get them to fight harder.
[02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:08.480]  What do we do?
[02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:11.120]  I want everybody to be prosperous.
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:13.720]  You think I was looking in a neighborhood and I drove by and there was nice cars and
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:14.880]  nice people.
[02:39:14.880 --> 02:39:17.440]  They were Hispanic or black or whatever.
[02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:18.440]  I don't care what color they were.
[02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:21.840]  If they're nice, I'd live there.
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:24.400]  The main thing is don't be creepy with a chip on your shoulder.
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:29.720]  And I'll tell you, in my experience, weird upper class white people who you don't want
[02:39:29.720 --> 02:39:30.720]  to live around.
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:34.960]  But that isn't some anti-white statement.
[02:39:34.960 --> 02:39:37.160]  It's a statement of truth.
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:39.280]  And they're the types that are running the show.
[02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:45.680]  They are so aware, like psychopaths, of how normal people operate that they can't help
[02:39:45.680 --> 02:39:54.400]  but flip those levers because you can be a big hero on TV exposing the racism.
[02:39:54.400 --> 02:40:01.360]  The racism of the NFL being 90% black, the average player being paid $5 million a year.
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:06.280]  And then you take that and turn it into an example of how white people, half the folks
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:11.920]  in the stands, worshiping black people, wearing their jerseys, they're out to get you.
[02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:17.520]  If you can get folks to buy into that and get people that are worth tens of millions
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:22.160]  of dollars bitching how they're oppressed, well, somebody making $50,000 a year is spending
[02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:28.160]  20% of their discretionary income on tickets to come kiss your butt, then maybe you can
[02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:32.280]  do anything because if that didn't mind control, I don't know what is.
[02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:37.280]  But we have the clip, GOP Senators Question Trump's competency, moral authority.
[02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:39.080]  We told you first that was coming.
[02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:41.240]  You want to play that clip?
[02:40:41.240 --> 02:40:42.240]  Is this the clip or there?
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:43.240]  I just saw the text.
[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:47.240]  Oh, this is the professor's article or just play a clip of it.
[02:40:47.240 --> 02:40:52.000]  Not only is Donald Trump a white supremacist sympathizer, I think he identifies with this
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:58.520]  notion of white supremacy, this notion of preservation of white culture and does that
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:41:00.520]  make him a white supremacist?
[02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:01.520]  Yeah.
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:02.520]  I can't hear anymore.
[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:06.200]  Everybody's a white supremacist, I get it.
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:10.440]  Everybody's one, but George Soros is an actual Nazi, I get it.
[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:19.360]  The literal people putting swastikas on their cars with crosses through it, with red, ghost
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:25.360]  buster symbols over it, is funded by a real Nazi.
[02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:27.560]  You can't make that up.
[02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:31.480]  In fact, it would be hilarious if it wasn't so true.
[02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:38.400]  I mean, what Twilight Zone fruitcake land did I wake up in, where in the town I live,
[02:41:38.400 --> 02:41:50.520]  they had a big event at a hotel with naked men, with gigantic male organs covered in
[02:41:50.520 --> 02:42:01.480]  silver glitter, standing there with little kids holding them and kissing them.
[02:42:01.480 --> 02:42:03.360]  That's power.
[02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:04.360]  That's just one of the photos.
[02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:12.440]  They got him kissing a little boy that's dressed up like a girl with a man, with his genitals
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:18.360]  covered in glitter, and little kids handed money to him, and then I'm the bad guy if
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:21.920]  we're going, whoa, man, that is creepy.
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:31.040]  Can you imagine if you were, I show up at a park with glitter on our genitals, and we
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:37.120]  watered up to some kids, they come over and give us money, and they hug us, and their
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:40.680]  moms are there fawning over us.
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:45.560]  That's what we've reached, folks, and those big fat men with wigs on, hanging upside down,
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:50.040]  taking their butts and little kids' faces, and they were ever getting money.
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:53.680]  That's the lovelest dimension.
[02:42:53.680 --> 02:43:00.040]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[02:43:00.040 --> 02:43:06.440]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[02:43:06.440 --> 02:43:13.680]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:18.600]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear, and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:19.600]  at infowarstore.com.
[02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:23.240]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best chloride-free toothpaste
[02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:28.440]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for
[02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:29.440]  children and adults.
[02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:33.640]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver
[02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:41.480]  and iodine as well, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139, and your purchase of the products stands
[02:43:41.480 --> 02:43:45.000]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:46.640]  satanic pedophile armies.
[02:43:46.640 --> 02:43:49.760]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:57.520]  against us, so we need your support.
[02:43:57.520 --> 02:44:01.760]  We're running the biggest specials, we've run them like six months, and free shipping,
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:06.240]  store-wide at infowarstore.com, and when we sell products at this lower price, we've
[02:44:06.240 --> 02:44:10.000]  got to sell a lot of it to fund the operation, but I know the products are so good that
[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:13.240]  even though we make a very small profit on each item, you'll like them and then order
[02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:18.440]  more, especially things like the coffee that's so good, or our toothpaste, or our mouthwash,
[02:44:18.440 --> 02:44:24.480]  or our vitamin mineral fusion, fruit punch drink, it's got all the amino acids and multivitamins,
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:30.080]  our probiotic, all of it, super-melvitality, 50% off, never done that, and free shipping,
[02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:31.080]  boom.
[02:44:31.080 --> 02:44:36.840]  Super-fummelvitality, 50% off, with free shipping, boom, bomb defense, 50% off, with free shipping.
[02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:39.000]  With the free shipping, folks, it's a lost leader.
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:42.480]  If you sign up for auto-ship, we're losing like $6, $7 on this.
[02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:44.560]  That matter, I just want you to see how great it is.
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:49.240]  We are now four and a half hours into the worldwide broadcast, America Rebirth, and Renaissance
[02:44:49.240 --> 02:44:51.280]  was so much coming up today.
[02:44:51.280 --> 02:44:56.480]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us.
[02:44:56.480 --> 02:44:57.840]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:44:57.840 --> 02:44:59.560]  Why is this so good?
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:04.280]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:08.880]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[02:45:08.880 --> 02:45:09.880]  my system.
[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:15.120]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:17.920]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:23.000]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:24.280]  going on everywhere.
[02:45:24.280 --> 02:45:25.280]  These are all parasites.
[02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:28.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:29.240]  You have the neem in there.
[02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:32.320]  You have the organic clove bug, the organic wormwood.
[02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:35.680]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:36.680]  All right.
[02:45:36.680 --> 02:45:38.800]  Let's get this stuff back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:39.800]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:45:39.800 --> 02:45:42.640]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com, and folks, you can't lose.
[02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:48.880]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period, and you support the broadcast, infowarslives.com.
[02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:51.120]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:54.800]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:45:58.600]  Enjoy all natural bath and beauty products with Emmerich's Essentials.

[02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:29.080]  products.

[02:47:46.440 --> 02:47:58.640]  your body, your body, your body, your body, your body, your body, your body, your body,
[02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:02.300]  your body, your body.
[02:48:02.300 --> 02:48:12.660]  The Emmerich's Essentials is free of chemicals and toxins that may harm your body.
[02:48:12.660 --> 02:48:18.100]  And then say it didn't exist five, six years ago when we first covered it and to now see
[02:48:18.100 --> 02:48:24.420]  them announce it today, a secret army of the EU built in Germany, aircraft tanks, submarines,
[02:48:24.420 --> 02:48:26.780]  you name it, aircraft carriers all being announced.
[02:48:26.780 --> 02:48:32.100]  It's like a replay of the 1930s all over again.
[02:48:32.100 --> 02:48:33.100]  It's insane.
[02:48:33.100 --> 02:48:38.300]  Just like the roaring 20s before the Great Depression, we're just here partying and,
[02:48:38.300 --> 02:48:44.860]  well, hey, be open, let a little five-year-old girl go over and give $10 to a big fat man
[02:48:44.860 --> 02:48:48.740]  shaking his ass in her face.
[02:48:48.740 --> 02:48:49.740]  Be open.
[02:48:49.740 --> 02:48:58.300]  And by the way, we're going to teach your kids this.
[02:48:58.300 --> 02:49:01.980]  Just briefly, because we need to fund our operation, I'm going to your calls.
[02:49:01.980 --> 02:49:03.940]  This is my favorite new t-shirt.
[02:49:03.940 --> 02:49:07.060]  I did a commercial, a few weeks ago for a t-shirt, so for some reason this didn't get
[02:49:07.060 --> 02:49:09.260]  the stack I was promoting.
[02:49:09.260 --> 02:49:12.700]  But I should have said it's the shirt I don't want to promote, but it is the shirt I want
[02:49:12.700 --> 02:49:13.700]  to promote.
[02:49:13.700 --> 02:49:21.220]  It is, won't tread on me, big Gadsden snake, no flag, just a snake, really nice yellow,
[02:49:21.220 --> 02:49:22.540]  kind of like National Park yellow.
[02:49:22.540 --> 02:49:24.100]  It's not even like a school bus yellow.
[02:49:24.100 --> 02:49:25.700]  It's like a National Park yellow.
[02:49:25.700 --> 02:49:30.180]  It says, won't tread on me, infowars.com, on the right hand shoulder of the American
[02:49:30.180 --> 02:49:34.420]  flag, infowars.com on the back.
[02:49:34.420 --> 02:49:38.180]  Really soft, great fabric, and it helps fund our operation.
[02:49:38.180 --> 02:49:46.580]  It is amazing, infowars.com, or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[02:49:46.580 --> 02:49:52.820]  And it's your purchase of the products that makes it all possible.
[02:49:52.820 --> 02:50:00.340]  Again, this was printed in the U.S., but actually sewn in Mexico, because for this quality of
[02:50:00.340 --> 02:50:06.060]  shirt to be even more, it wasn't, a lot of our shirts are made in America.
[02:50:06.060 --> 02:50:13.840]  But I'm really proud of this shirt, infowars.com, please get it today, and we've got free shipping
[02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:15.340]  still running store-wide.
[02:50:15.340 --> 02:50:19.180]  A bunch of the specials that were there, though, did end, as I said they would, SuperMail Vitality
[02:50:19.180 --> 02:50:20.180]  is gone.
[02:50:20.180 --> 02:50:24.260]  Paleo Caveman, Bo and Rob, is back on, and they're about to sell out of it.
[02:50:24.260 --> 02:50:28.660]  We still have the Bio and Defense probiotic, that's still 50% off, and a lot of other
[02:50:28.660 --> 02:50:32.180]  great new deals that are going to end in two days, because a lot of these new things we're
[02:50:32.180 --> 02:50:34.300]  doing at 50% off, are about to sell out.
[02:50:34.300 --> 02:50:38.380]  So these are really true loss leaders, sign up for auto, ship with initial 10% off, whatever
[02:50:38.380 --> 02:50:39.380]  you do.
[02:50:39.380 --> 02:50:40.380]  We're not perfect.
[02:50:40.380 --> 02:50:42.300]  God, I'm half the time, I can't listen to myself.
[02:50:42.300 --> 02:50:48.020]  But the point is, thanks for putting up with us, and just get the products, use them, know
[02:50:48.020 --> 02:50:52.580]  you're fighting our operation, tell us what you think about them, they have like 98% success
[02:50:52.580 --> 02:50:53.580]  rates.
[02:50:53.580 --> 02:51:00.340]  Kevin in Jacksonville, Florida, wants to talk about assimilation in Dearborn, I think he's
[02:51:00.340 --> 02:51:05.380]  probably talking about the latest jihadi stabbing at the Mall of America in Minneapolis, St.
[02:51:05.380 --> 02:51:11.780]  Paul, and the Somali that did it, and the fact that it was footage shot at the mall,
[02:51:11.780 --> 02:51:20.860]  95% Somalis there now, because Minnesota, I mean Minneapolis is the new capital of Somalia,
[02:51:20.860 --> 02:51:21.860]  and they're not assimilating.
[02:51:21.860 --> 02:51:24.780]  They should just, you can't go to Somalia and live, but we're supposed to bring them
[02:51:24.780 --> 02:51:29.100]  here and then they're going to live in peace, and the left encourages them, don't give up
[02:51:29.100 --> 02:51:32.700]  your culture, cut your women's journals off, shell them, beat them, kill them, this is
[02:51:32.700 --> 02:51:33.700]  liberal.
[02:51:33.700 --> 02:51:35.540]  It's always liberal, as long as it's anti-Christian.
[02:51:35.540 --> 02:51:38.740]  So Kevin, tell us about assimilation in Dearborn, Michigan.
[02:51:38.740 --> 02:51:44.500]  Thank you Alex, yeah, as you pointed out, I'm actually originally from Redford, but
[02:51:44.500 --> 02:51:49.860]  I have two uncles who live in Dearborn, and I want people to be aware that this left
[02:51:49.860 --> 02:51:57.780]  pushing this ridiculous theme of bringing everybody in with open arms is ridiculous.
[02:51:57.780 --> 02:52:02.060]  There's parts, it's not just Dearborn, Michigan, it's really the whole state of Michigan, that
[02:52:02.060 --> 02:52:05.060]  is literally, it's like Sharia law.
[02:52:05.060 --> 02:52:10.940]  There's certain places that, they've got the minaret stuff, they've got called a prayer,
[02:52:10.940 --> 02:52:15.300]  businesses that sell alcohol or people are getting beat up, it's on.
[02:52:15.300 --> 02:52:21.340]  Joel, I can't think of his name, there's no place like Utopia Video, he went there
[02:52:21.340 --> 02:52:24.380]  and even he was scared for his life and he had arms security.
[02:52:24.380 --> 02:52:30.620]  So people need to be aware of who they're letting in and why these corrupt elected officials
[02:52:30.620 --> 02:52:33.420]  are doing it, they're doing it to push an agenda.
[02:52:33.420 --> 02:52:40.060]  And another thing is, Michigan's another great place for being an economy to be wiped
[02:52:40.060 --> 02:52:41.060]  out.
[02:52:41.060 --> 02:52:44.740]  People also need to be aware of these AIAC technologies because people have to understand
[02:52:44.740 --> 02:52:53.220]  that, Michigan used to be the hub of the industrial revolution as far as the car business goes
[02:52:53.220 --> 02:52:59.180]  and then when these agendas now push the brain in robots to take over these people's jobs,
[02:52:59.180 --> 02:53:03.620]  people just need to be aware, they need to understand that, you know, when you bring
[02:53:03.620 --> 02:53:08.900]  in all these technologies, sometimes you're giving up more than just convenience, there's
[02:53:08.900 --> 02:53:13.460]  a lot of people that are out of jobs now and this tech boom bubble, it's not gonna last
[02:53:13.460 --> 02:53:17.620]  forever, you're gonna have to have humans build these things, if not you're gonna see
[02:53:17.620 --> 02:53:20.980]  like we're seeing in Saudi Arabia where robots gonna take over.
[02:53:20.980 --> 02:53:22.480]  No, that's it.
[02:53:22.480 --> 02:53:27.860]  What the hell, the left just wants to be able to pose naked with your child, the photo.
[02:53:27.860 --> 02:53:31.100]  So great point, Kevin, it's very dangerous.
[02:53:31.100 --> 02:53:35.620]  Did you see the footage during the stabbing in the Mall of America?
[02:53:35.620 --> 02:53:41.700]  Just nothing but, I mean, it looks like you're in downtown Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
[02:53:41.700 --> 02:53:47.080]  It's crazy, there's a mall in Westland, I think it's in Westland, Michigan, it's called
[02:53:47.080 --> 02:53:52.140]  Fairlane Mall, it's actually one of the most dangerous malls in America because it's totally
[02:53:52.140 --> 02:53:59.060]  Islamic and when I saw the footage, it looked pretty much like it was the Mall of America,
[02:53:59.060 --> 02:54:05.700]  everyone's in full burgers with hijabs and nobody speaks English and especially if you're
[02:54:05.700 --> 02:54:10.540]  a white male and you walk around there, you get weird looks and I think the crazy thing
[02:54:10.540 --> 02:54:15.380]  is that you have, the two people were trying to defend their property from being stolen.
[02:54:15.380 --> 02:54:21.860]  I mean, what does that say about these tolerant, loving Islamists that they're trying to steal
[02:54:21.860 --> 02:54:27.060]  somebody's stuff and the guy was trying to defend himself and he gets stabbed, you know?
[02:54:27.060 --> 02:54:28.060]  I'm gonna hear it.
[02:54:28.060 --> 02:54:33.340]  Well, if you notice, if you watch this video, the airings, they don't want to assimilate,
[02:54:33.340 --> 02:54:37.500]  they're gonna assimilate you and just even the kids are trotting around just like, just
[02:54:37.500 --> 02:54:40.780]  back the video up, just strut around, it's like, you bet we're taking over, you're used
[02:54:40.780 --> 02:54:43.780]  to it.
[02:54:43.780 --> 02:54:47.500]  The loving police officials and they give them the key to the city after this is all
[02:54:47.500 --> 02:54:52.940]  done, I mean, it's incredible with the time we're living in, Alex.
[02:54:52.940 --> 02:54:57.620]  We've been asleep, brother, and people that hate us are in control and that's why they're
[02:54:57.620 --> 02:55:05.460]  so scared of Trump because he's just not out to get us and the fact, and you read about
[02:55:05.460 --> 02:55:10.780]  this like 90% of the Muslims are on welfare and they have another job, they just, it's
[02:55:10.780 --> 02:55:16.140]  all fraud, it's all a joke, it's all, I mean, they won't let us move to their countries
[02:55:16.140 --> 02:55:21.660]  when I'm saying, oh, you're being racist, I can't move to their country.
[02:55:21.660 --> 02:55:27.380]  You should send one of your reporters to a Social Security office in Texas because I'm
[02:55:27.380 --> 02:55:32.020]  pretty sure it's like it is down here in Florida and of a mission and it's literally like you're
[02:55:32.020 --> 02:55:38.940]  at the United Nations Convention, it's anybody who's not American, nobody speaks English,
[02:55:38.940 --> 02:55:45.740]  I've been in there before and heard Creole, Spanish, Arabic, Farsi, Russian, anything and
[02:55:45.740 --> 02:55:50.580]  everything but American, none of the tellers are American, everyone has anti-American rhetoric,
[02:55:50.580 --> 02:55:51.580]  it's just incredible.
[02:55:51.580 --> 02:55:52.580]  No, I know.
[02:55:52.580 --> 02:55:53.580]  We've allowed this to happen.
[02:55:53.580 --> 02:55:58.660]  And here's the deal, it's not that immigrants are bad, it's that the globalists are bringing
[02:55:58.660 --> 02:56:03.180]  in the worst and forging them into an army.
[02:56:03.180 --> 02:56:04.180]  It's just incredible.
[02:56:04.180 --> 02:56:05.180]  Thank you.
[02:56:05.180 --> 02:56:13.020]  See, I took one caller in that segment, I've got like 10 more but these are great callers.
[02:56:13.020 --> 02:56:16.220]  Let's go ahead and go to Conner in Long Island, New York, Conner, you're on the air.
[02:56:16.220 --> 02:56:18.220]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:56:18.220 --> 02:56:21.900]  I just kind of wanted to bring something to your attention, maybe completely meaningless.
[02:56:21.900 --> 02:56:25.780]  I sent it to Shepard and Bellas this week before he went on your show.
[02:56:25.780 --> 02:56:34.460]  This is an article from the Las Vegas Review Journal for August 2017 talking about a, quote,
[02:56:34.460 --> 02:56:37.900]  Middle Eastern Air Force booking the entire W, Las Vegas.
[02:56:37.900 --> 02:56:43.380]  Long story short, you scroll down to the end of the article and it specifies that this
[02:56:43.380 --> 02:56:50.340]  is suggested to be a Saudi Air Force and they will be staying this year at the W instead
[02:56:50.340 --> 02:56:54.420]  of the Four Seasons where they traditionally stay for this exercise every year with the
[02:56:54.420 --> 02:56:56.420]  U.S. Air Force.
[02:56:56.420 --> 02:56:58.620]  The Four Seasons is the top floor of the Mandalay Bay.
[02:56:58.620 --> 02:56:59.620]  Yes.
[02:56:59.620 --> 02:57:01.540]  I just found that to be a little interesting.
[02:57:01.540 --> 02:57:02.940]  Maybe your team can kind of...
[02:57:02.940 --> 02:57:06.340]  Our military source to say it was basically an attempt to kill the prince and it was all
[02:57:06.340 --> 02:57:11.140]  a big civil war deal and then, yes, we've had all the talk about that have been picked
[02:57:11.140 --> 02:57:12.140]  up by the FBI.
[02:57:12.140 --> 02:57:14.140]  So, yeah, it's very, very serious.
[02:57:14.140 --> 02:57:17.100]  I just found that very interesting to have me out in the open but...
[02:57:17.100 --> 02:57:18.100]  Stay there.
[02:57:18.100 --> 02:57:19.100]  Don't hang up, Conner.
[02:57:19.100 --> 02:57:20.100]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:57:20.100 --> 02:57:21.900]  I'm going to go to all the calls for Matt DeVio.
[02:57:21.900 --> 02:57:27.540]  He'll take us over, straight ahead, 70 seconds away, fourth hour, then the war room with Owen
[02:57:27.540 --> 02:57:28.540]  Shroyd.
[02:57:28.540 --> 02:57:29.540]  Yeah, it's just...
[02:57:29.540 --> 02:57:30.540]  It's absolutely crazy.
[02:57:30.540 --> 02:57:35.100]  I don't know what's worse, the radical Islam or the pedophile networks.
[02:57:35.100 --> 02:57:44.660]  I think the pedophiles, I think they're the worst thing.
[02:57:44.660 --> 02:57:49.340]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout by InfoWarsLife.

[02:59:47.580 --> 03:00:04.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:04.900 --> 03:00:26.020]  All right, Conor and Long Island, you were getting into the Saudi Air Force occupying
[03:00:26.020 --> 03:00:28.500]  the very floors where the attacks were launched from.
[03:00:28.500 --> 03:00:32.780]  Yeah, that's what the feds don't want us to get into, it's the whole Saudi Civil War.
[03:00:32.780 --> 03:00:38.380]  Trump reportedly has struck back with all these arrests of the pro-Islamicist globalist
[03:00:38.380 --> 03:00:39.380]  forces.
[03:00:39.380 --> 03:00:44.020]  I'm going to sit back and watch and see exactly what flushes out, but I think you're over
[03:00:44.020 --> 03:00:45.180]  the target with those statements.
[03:00:45.180 --> 03:00:46.180]  Go ahead.
[03:00:46.180 --> 03:00:55.660]  It's kind of right out in the open, Las Vegas Review Journal, August 4th, 2017, discussing
[03:00:55.660 --> 03:01:02.020]  that the Saudi delegations typically stay at Mandalay Bay, essentially the top floors
[03:01:02.020 --> 03:01:07.580]  are those four seasons, which are Saudi print zones, almost 50% of, but this year they did
[03:01:07.580 --> 03:01:08.580]  not stay there.
[03:01:08.580 --> 03:01:12.460]  It could be totally nothing, but obviously people like yourself and Shepard that are
[03:01:12.460 --> 03:01:17.140]  more in the know would be able to kind of dig into that, but just found that to be a
[03:01:17.140 --> 03:01:18.140]  little interesting.
[03:01:18.140 --> 03:01:19.140]  So thanks for taking my call.
[03:01:19.140 --> 03:01:23.220]  Well, just to be clear, you're in the know as much as we are, you're a smart sentient
[03:01:23.220 --> 03:01:27.180]  being, but yeah, that's where this whole investigation is going, a Saudi Arabia Civil
[03:01:27.180 --> 03:01:28.180]  War situation.
[03:01:28.180 --> 03:01:34.180]  Let's talk to, thank you, sir, Sean in California, you're on the air.
[03:01:34.180 --> 03:01:37.060]  Hi, I'll explain to speak to you again.
[03:01:37.060 --> 03:01:38.060]  Thank you.
[03:01:38.060 --> 03:01:42.940]  I just want to say, man, I got to tell you, I got your products late in my game, but
[03:01:42.940 --> 03:01:48.340]  I have ADHD and I got to tell you, your brain force definitely makes my, my nerves connect
[03:01:48.340 --> 03:01:49.340]  a lot cleaner.
[03:01:49.340 --> 03:01:51.740]  And I don't think that it's promoted that way.
[03:01:51.740 --> 03:01:56.100]  But if you have people that are, you know, in my age, 30 year old who need something
[03:01:56.100 --> 03:01:59.540]  to focus, definitely one of the, the greatest things I've ever had.
[03:01:59.540 --> 03:02:04.780]  And I've taken Dexadrine, Ritalin, this is like the smoothest night concentrator I've
[03:02:04.780 --> 03:02:05.780]  ever been on.
[03:02:05.780 --> 03:02:09.900]  Well, let me be clear, everybody's brain's different.
[03:02:09.900 --> 03:02:13.860]  And just like studies show, Ritalin helps some people hurts others.
[03:02:13.860 --> 03:02:16.260]  This doesn't have drugs and it has legal compounds.
[03:02:16.260 --> 03:02:22.460]  Some though are drugs in Europe, but we only with what was very safe and known to help
[03:02:22.460 --> 03:02:29.740]  people to have, like you said, smooth brain function, not jacked up, not low, but let
[03:02:29.740 --> 03:02:35.940]  your brain have the compounds and chemicals it needs for normal electrochemical operation.
[03:02:35.940 --> 03:02:40.540]  And at the normal price of $39, it's a pretty good deal.
[03:02:40.540 --> 03:02:44.580]  But we always sell it for a discount at, you know, at least 20%.
[03:02:44.580 --> 03:02:50.420]  So it really is the Rolls Royce of deutropics at a much lower price.
[03:02:50.420 --> 03:02:54.980]  There are a lot of other brands that have similar compounds in them and similar mixes
[03:02:54.980 --> 03:02:56.980]  for $80, $200.
[03:02:56.980 --> 03:02:59.700]  People tend to respect that more and think, well, it must be really good if it costs a
[03:02:59.700 --> 03:03:00.700]  lot.
[03:03:00.700 --> 03:03:02.340]  No, it's just marked up four times, five times.
[03:03:02.340 --> 03:03:05.500]  We mark brain force up at rare sales price 100%.
[03:03:05.500 --> 03:03:11.620]  When we sell it at $29, it's only marked up, you know, like 50%, 60%.
[03:03:11.620 --> 03:03:13.700]  So again, thank you for your support.
[03:03:13.700 --> 03:03:15.740]  I'm glad you like brain force.
[03:03:15.740 --> 03:03:17.380]  It's it, it is powerful.
[03:03:17.380 --> 03:03:19.460]  I mean, I mean, overall you're talking about it.
[03:03:19.460 --> 03:03:22.460]  I mean, describe what it's like when you're on it.
[03:03:22.460 --> 03:03:27.900]  Man, the one thing I could tell you, it makes you feel like what you're supposed to feel.
[03:03:27.900 --> 03:03:31.860]  Like, you know, you get coffee or something like that.
[03:03:31.860 --> 03:03:36.500]  It's something that definitely wakes up your brain, makes your brain waves a lot smoother,
[03:03:36.500 --> 03:03:41.540]  connect way quicker so that if you're in like a confrontation and you usually have
[03:03:41.540 --> 03:03:46.500]  a issue with coming out clean, this gives you the opportunity to get all your thoughts
[03:03:46.500 --> 03:03:51.460]  out clean the way you want it to come out and it just gives you like the actual power
[03:03:51.460 --> 03:03:53.060]  that you know what you're talking about.
[03:03:53.060 --> 03:03:59.220]  I was about to say, I do late night radio a lot coast to coast to AM, you name it.
[03:03:59.220 --> 03:04:01.820]  And it like 10 at night coffee doesn't work anymore.
[03:04:01.820 --> 03:04:06.380]  So I found beer in low levels had a stimulant, but then that would make me, you know, out
[03:04:06.380 --> 03:04:07.380]  of shape.
[03:04:07.380 --> 03:04:10.980]  And then I tried other new troubles and things that would speed me up too much.
[03:04:10.980 --> 03:04:14.860]  The thing is I can take brain force and go to sleep in two hours if I need to.
[03:04:14.860 --> 03:04:18.860]  What it does is it just gives you the connectivity you need.
[03:04:18.860 --> 03:04:20.220]  It doesn't speed you up.
[03:04:20.220 --> 03:04:26.500]  It just gives you the baseline building blocks to then be supercharged and I'm really proud
[03:04:26.500 --> 03:04:27.500]  of it.
[03:04:27.500 --> 03:04:31.140]  So I want to thank you for your support, Sean, and I want to thank you for promoting brain
[03:04:31.140 --> 03:04:32.140]  force.
[03:04:32.140 --> 03:04:33.140]  Thank you, sir.
[03:04:33.140 --> 03:04:35.140]  Anything else you want to add?
[03:04:35.140 --> 03:04:40.100]  I just want to say if anybody wants a free sticker, I drive a bright red truck.
[03:04:40.100 --> 03:04:41.740]  Come and get your We The People sticker.
[03:04:41.740 --> 03:04:43.820]  I'll give them on traffic.
[03:04:43.820 --> 03:04:44.820]  That's awesome, brother.
[03:04:44.820 --> 03:04:49.420]  We'll be back to interview Matt Dubiel from our Chicago affiliate and take some of your
[03:04:49.420 --> 03:04:50.420]  calls straight ahead.
[03:04:50.420 --> 03:04:57.940]  If you go to infowarstore.com and get game changing, amazing products, we've been sold
[03:04:57.940 --> 03:05:01.380]  out of DNA force for almost four months.
[03:05:01.380 --> 03:05:06.860]  These ingredients start, nutraceutical grade, the highest quality, the bio-PQQ, all of it.
[03:05:06.860 --> 03:05:08.300]  It's 25% off.
[03:05:08.300 --> 03:05:13.100]  The truck got in this morning and it's back, but it is a limited run because of all the
[03:05:13.100 --> 03:05:15.740]  testing and all the rest of it, it's the highest quality.
[03:05:15.740 --> 03:05:17.620]  Read about what it'll do for you and your family.
[03:05:17.620 --> 03:05:18.620]  It is amazing.
[03:05:18.620 --> 03:05:23.300]  We also have been sold out for three months on biome defense, super high quality, probiotic.
[03:05:23.300 --> 03:05:24.300]  It's 25% off.
[03:05:24.300 --> 03:05:29.300]  Out of the gates, back in stock, but for a very limited time.
[03:05:29.300 --> 03:05:31.740]  So you get the highest quality, the very cleanest stuff out there.
[03:05:31.740 --> 03:05:33.220]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:05:33.220 --> 03:05:35.660]  DNA force and biome defense, probiotic.
[03:05:35.660 --> 03:05:37.660]  Now back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[03:05:37.660 --> 03:05:41.140]  When you buy products from globalists, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[03:05:41.140 --> 03:05:42.620]  It is an act of war.
[03:05:42.620 --> 03:05:46.820]  It is an act of standing up when you spread the links, the articles and buy products from
[03:05:46.820 --> 03:06:09.420]  us and when we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[03:06:09.420 --> 03:06:12.140]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:12.140 --> 03:06:19.500]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[03:06:19.500 --> 03:06:27.500]  WCKG 1530 AM Chicago carrying the war room is coming up in an hour.
[03:06:27.500 --> 03:06:29.060]  Carrying real news at David Knight.
[03:06:29.060 --> 03:06:30.060]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:30.060 --> 03:06:31.620]  He's taken over here right now.
[03:06:31.620 --> 03:06:37.900]  We're taking a few calls before we go to Bant WBO, but we were just talking to one of the
[03:06:37.900 --> 03:06:45.340]  callers about awakening and about how manipulative all of this is.
[03:06:45.340 --> 03:06:46.740]  It's just crazy.
[03:06:46.740 --> 03:06:48.820]  It's not left-wing, right-wing.
[03:06:48.820 --> 03:06:53.660]  I'm the guy that coined the term left-right paradigm, that they try to put us on left
[03:06:53.660 --> 03:06:54.660]  or right.
[03:06:54.660 --> 03:06:57.180]  It doesn't mean there isn't a left or right debate going on.
[03:06:57.180 --> 03:07:00.460]  It doesn't mean there aren't some issues, the left promotes that I think are correct
[03:07:00.460 --> 03:07:03.540]  or some issues, the right promotes that are correct.
[03:07:03.540 --> 03:07:06.540]  It doesn't mean there isn't elites in control of each group and that it doesn't have big
[03:07:06.540 --> 03:07:11.420]  problems, but that's one spectrum of analysis.
[03:07:11.420 --> 03:07:17.420]  Above that are the technocrats, and I'm trying to get people to think how the technocrats
[03:07:17.420 --> 03:07:21.460]  think and be aware of the larger picture.
[03:07:21.460 --> 03:07:24.900]  That's my real job because if we do that, we're going to end up winning.
[03:07:24.900 --> 03:07:31.460]  I want to go to Mike and others here in a moment, but going back to Matt Dubio, who's
[03:07:31.460 --> 03:07:36.940]  going to host the show, Matt, I've got a lot of news to get to, but I've run out of time
[03:07:36.940 --> 03:07:40.900]  and I've got a few callers here and I'm kind of coming into your hour, but you've always
[03:07:40.900 --> 03:07:42.740]  got big fish to fry.
[03:07:42.740 --> 03:07:46.300]  What's on your radar screen coming up?
[03:07:46.300 --> 03:07:50.940]  I just want to kind of take off on what you just got into.
[03:07:50.940 --> 03:07:53.540]  We do get caught up in this left-right paradigm.
[03:07:53.540 --> 03:07:59.300]  It's easy to do when we're talking about issues like guns or issues like gay rights
[03:07:59.300 --> 03:08:03.460]  or tranny rights or whatever the new issue of the day is.
[03:08:03.460 --> 03:08:08.300]  We get divided into this left-right thing, and I just think you hit it right on the head.
[03:08:08.300 --> 03:08:10.260]  It's not about that paradigm.
[03:08:10.260 --> 03:08:15.260]  It's really about stepping one, getting a layer above that and taking a look at what
[03:08:15.260 --> 03:08:20.960]  exactly is going on in this world of ours, this simulation of sorts that we're living
[03:08:20.960 --> 03:08:25.860]  in here on this planet for right now, by the way, which I know sounds crazy to somebody.
[03:08:25.860 --> 03:08:26.860]  No, it's not.
[03:08:26.860 --> 03:08:27.860]  That's it.
[03:08:27.860 --> 03:08:32.700]  But what is the grand manipulation, not following the stuff they say I should follow?
[03:08:32.700 --> 03:08:34.700]  What's really behind all this?
[03:08:34.700 --> 03:08:36.540]  What's the next dimension?
[03:08:36.540 --> 03:08:44.980]  Yeah, and sometimes the people that are perpetrating the ideas are not necessarily complicit in
[03:08:44.980 --> 03:08:46.620]  the grand scheme.
[03:08:46.620 --> 03:08:51.540]  They just got lucky and their dopey movie took off, and it happens to have undertones
[03:08:51.540 --> 03:08:55.060]  of men dressing like women or whatever the thing of the day is.
[03:08:55.060 --> 03:08:56.060]  Exactly.
[03:08:56.060 --> 03:08:58.180]  The only useful idiots are not the enemy.
[03:08:58.180 --> 03:08:59.180]  They don't mean bad.
[03:08:59.180 --> 03:09:01.220]  They're just cannon fodder.
[03:09:01.220 --> 03:09:02.380]  Exactly.
[03:09:02.380 --> 03:09:05.700]  And then you look back, and that's one of the things that I'm going to do.
[03:09:05.700 --> 03:09:10.140]  I mean, I was watching your conversations with Gavin today and listening to your show
[03:09:10.140 --> 03:09:14.900]  and seeing this thing, this nonsense that's going on in the hotel with the transvestites
[03:09:14.900 --> 03:09:18.220]  and the poles and the glitter and the whole thing.
[03:09:18.220 --> 03:09:21.460]  And it got me to really think about something that I've been working on for a while, which
[03:09:21.460 --> 03:09:28.340]  is mapping out the timeline of mainstream media and how they have systematically over
[03:09:28.340 --> 03:09:35.420]  decades maybe unbeknownst to them and unbeknownst to most people perpetrated this idea of men
[03:09:35.420 --> 03:09:36.780]  as women.
[03:09:36.780 --> 03:09:41.220]  And it's been happening a little bit like the frog in the boiling pot of water over time.
[03:09:41.220 --> 03:09:43.980]  And I'm going to go back to what I see is the beginning, but I have a feeling when I
[03:09:43.980 --> 03:09:47.900]  do it, other people are going to, light bulbs are going to go off and they're going to go
[03:09:47.900 --> 03:09:48.900]  yeah.
[03:09:48.900 --> 03:09:51.740]  They're going to go against a guy that wants to be a woman, I mean, I'm a living let live.
[03:09:51.740 --> 03:09:57.220]  The point is it's an agenda force fed everywhere that guys are dumb slobs or guys should be
[03:09:57.220 --> 03:09:59.460]  like women or women should be in charge.
[03:09:59.460 --> 03:10:02.420]  I'm not against women either, but they're force feeding it and you're going to get into
[03:10:02.420 --> 03:10:03.740]  what's behind it.
[03:10:03.740 --> 03:10:04.740]  Yeah.
[03:10:04.740 --> 03:10:05.740]  And I agree with you.
[03:10:05.740 --> 03:10:09.100]  As an individual, anybody can do what they want to do.
[03:10:09.100 --> 03:10:14.660]  I believe that we should love and appreciate everybody and respect and appreciate everybody.
[03:10:14.660 --> 03:10:16.500]  But that is not what's happening here.
[03:10:16.500 --> 03:10:22.020]  Exactly, they're trying to make us accept whatever the new thing is they're pushing.
[03:10:22.020 --> 03:10:26.100]  As normal as the way that it is, and it's not the way it is.
[03:10:26.100 --> 03:10:29.380]  And somebody's got to raise their hand and say, wait, wait, wait, wait, you can do what
[03:10:29.380 --> 03:10:30.580]  you want to do.
[03:10:30.580 --> 03:10:32.080]  That's pretty goofy.
[03:10:32.080 --> 03:10:33.080]  I'm not going to treat you.
[03:10:33.080 --> 03:10:35.780]  You're not going to teach my kid how to do it.
[03:10:35.780 --> 03:10:36.780]  Amen.
[03:10:36.780 --> 03:10:37.780]  Exactly.
[03:10:37.780 --> 03:10:45.060]  Man, I mean, the globalists are so obsessed with children, it really is sick.
[03:10:45.060 --> 03:10:48.100]  It's a problem if we allow it to be a problem.
[03:10:48.100 --> 03:10:53.780]  And there's some things that we do that are very innocent that unfortunately teaches them
[03:10:53.780 --> 03:10:54.780]  the wrong things.
[03:10:54.780 --> 03:10:58.460]  I mean, I've been taking my kids trick or treating since they were babies, but think
[03:10:58.460 --> 03:11:00.620]  about the concept of the trick or treating, right?
[03:11:00.620 --> 03:11:05.380]  We're knocking on strangers' doors and we're talking to people that we've never met dressing
[03:11:05.380 --> 03:11:06.380]  up in.
[03:11:06.380 --> 03:11:09.380]  I mean, the whole concept is not a good precedent.
[03:11:09.380 --> 03:11:15.060]  The whole ultra occult to get you outside your family in a weird deal and that's what's
[03:11:15.060 --> 03:11:16.060]  going on.
[03:11:16.060 --> 03:11:17.740]  Yeah, it's absolutely.
[03:11:17.740 --> 03:11:22.460]  It's bad training and we have to be as fathers and leaders.
[03:11:22.460 --> 03:11:23.460]  Thank God.
[03:11:23.460 --> 03:11:27.140]  I was thinking about this earlier also when I was watching one of the promos for you and
[03:11:27.140 --> 03:11:32.220]  your dad working on some of the supplements at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:11:32.220 --> 03:11:37.560]  And I thought, you know, some of us were blessed with great fathers and some of us are a blessing
[03:11:37.560 --> 03:11:39.500]  to our children as great fathers.
[03:11:39.500 --> 03:11:40.900]  Not everybody has that.
[03:11:40.900 --> 03:11:46.740]  But what they've been doing for years now is systematically dismantling that institution
[03:11:46.740 --> 03:11:51.500]  of fatherhood and the idea of being a strong man in your family.
[03:11:51.500 --> 03:11:52.500]  And that's the best thing.
[03:11:52.500 --> 03:11:57.460]  Well, notice all of Hollywood, all the culture, that they're number one enemy, the Super Bowl
[03:11:57.460 --> 03:12:02.060]  ads, every major Netflix show, the dad is a piece of crap.
[03:12:02.060 --> 03:12:03.820]  And like, should everyone notice?
[03:12:03.820 --> 03:12:08.500]  Why does the power structure want to do that because they want a bunch of leaderless people
[03:12:08.500 --> 03:12:09.620]  they can run over?
[03:12:09.620 --> 03:12:12.260]  They want to enslave women and children and men.
[03:12:12.260 --> 03:12:14.100]  They want to cut the head off.
[03:12:14.100 --> 03:12:15.580]  And are men slobs?
[03:12:15.580 --> 03:12:17.620]  Have men not turned into pieces of crap?
[03:12:17.620 --> 03:12:18.620]  Absolutely.
[03:12:18.620 --> 03:12:21.460]  The point is, is that it's been done by design.
[03:12:21.460 --> 03:12:27.060]  It has and there's plenty of good fathers that are doing great jobs paying lots of attention
[03:12:27.060 --> 03:12:28.060]  to their kids.
[03:12:28.060 --> 03:12:29.580]  But they never get the attention.
[03:12:29.580 --> 03:12:30.580]  Never.
[03:12:30.580 --> 03:12:33.500]  You never see them because the ones that you see in the Disney movies, either the Disney
[03:12:33.500 --> 03:12:40.060]  movie, there are no parents, and the kids are orphaned, or the father's an idiot.
[03:12:40.060 --> 03:12:44.820]  And that's the state literally coming in to be the mommy and daddy.
[03:12:44.820 --> 03:12:46.580]  Well they know better than we do.
[03:12:46.580 --> 03:12:47.980]  That's what they want everybody to believe.
[03:12:47.980 --> 03:12:49.140]  They know better.
[03:12:49.140 --> 03:12:50.980]  The kids aren't our kids.
[03:12:50.980 --> 03:12:57.460]  It's clearly an idea that's been implanted in the brains of the masses, which is your
[03:12:57.460 --> 03:12:59.980]  leader in your family isn't your father.
[03:12:59.980 --> 03:13:00.980]  Men aren't good.
[03:13:00.980 --> 03:13:01.980]  Men are bad.
[03:13:01.980 --> 03:13:04.020]  Men aren't men.
[03:13:04.020 --> 03:13:06.100]  And the state knows better.
[03:13:06.100 --> 03:13:07.100]  The government knows better.
[03:13:07.100 --> 03:13:12.620]  The truth is, dad genetically is going to kill himself for you and fight to the death
[03:13:12.620 --> 03:13:13.620]  for you.
[03:13:13.620 --> 03:13:18.740]  And he's the one person they know if he's a straight up dad focused and his head screwed
[03:13:18.740 --> 03:13:20.860]  on straight, that's dangerous.
[03:13:20.860 --> 03:13:22.060]  That's why they fear dads.
[03:13:22.060 --> 03:13:26.420]  Because they're genetically ready to do whatever it takes, work themselves to death in coal
[03:13:26.420 --> 03:13:31.740]  mines or in cornfields or in wars or to do whatever it takes or to go after.
[03:13:31.740 --> 03:13:33.740]  There's controllers that want to enslave.
[03:13:33.740 --> 03:13:35.300]  What does a conquering army always do?
[03:13:35.300 --> 03:13:36.300]  It kills the men.
[03:13:36.300 --> 03:13:38.740]  And then it takes the children and the women.
[03:13:38.740 --> 03:13:39.740]  And Matt, that's what this is.
[03:13:39.740 --> 03:13:42.980]  We're under a conquering program.
[03:13:42.980 --> 03:13:47.980]  When you really step back and you look at all the things that are going on in the world,
[03:13:47.980 --> 03:13:51.660]  what's systematically being done is strong men are being taken out.
[03:13:51.660 --> 03:13:57.180]  And I can almost hear the roar of the feminists going, no, no, it's not what's happening.
[03:13:57.180 --> 03:13:58.180]  Yes.
[03:13:58.180 --> 03:13:59.180]  Take a look.
[03:13:59.180 --> 03:14:02.420]  In fact, though, then they back Islam that truly enslave women, because that's their
[03:14:02.420 --> 03:14:03.420]  final end game.
[03:14:03.420 --> 03:14:05.260]  They don't want men that empower women.
[03:14:05.260 --> 03:14:07.180]  They want men that enslave women.
[03:14:07.180 --> 03:14:08.180]  It's scientific.
[03:14:08.180 --> 03:14:10.460]  It's pure evil.
[03:14:10.460 --> 03:14:12.060]  It's something that needs to be stopped.
[03:14:12.060 --> 03:14:17.460]  And the best line of defense for that is strong fathers and strong mothers together.
[03:14:17.460 --> 03:14:18.460]  Exactly.
[03:14:18.460 --> 03:14:19.460]  Which is unstoppable.
[03:14:19.460 --> 03:14:21.460]  That's the trifecta.
[03:14:21.460 --> 03:14:26.940]  Strong fathers, strong mothers and children together unstoppable.
[03:14:26.940 --> 03:14:32.260]  And it's also that the men, the strong men need to empower the strong women exactly to
[03:14:32.260 --> 03:14:35.660]  be strong in their role as mothers and wives.
[03:14:35.660 --> 03:14:36.660]  And for some reason.
[03:14:36.660 --> 03:14:41.060]  What I've got is my family training martial arts, learn to use firearms, business.
[03:14:41.060 --> 03:14:44.300]  It's not like as a dad who's a libertarian or something, I'm like trying to keep my
[03:14:44.300 --> 03:14:45.300]  daughters.
[03:14:45.300 --> 03:14:46.300]  No, I'm not an Islamist.
[03:14:46.300 --> 03:14:47.300]  I'm the opposite.
[03:14:47.300 --> 03:14:48.660]  I'm not Linda Sorcerer.
[03:14:48.660 --> 03:14:49.660]  Exactly.
[03:14:49.660 --> 03:14:54.580]  I want, if I have a daughter ends up being the best, I'll put her in charge of everything.
[03:14:54.580 --> 03:14:55.580]  That fast.
[03:14:55.580 --> 03:14:56.580]  That fast.
[03:14:56.580 --> 03:14:59.700]  You know who's a great example of that?
[03:14:59.700 --> 03:15:02.780]  Our president and his daughter.
[03:15:02.780 --> 03:15:04.220]  I mean, just look at that.
[03:15:04.220 --> 03:15:05.220]  What an example.
[03:15:05.220 --> 03:15:11.460]  I'll tell you, Alex, I was moved almost to tears at the inauguration when I saw the president
[03:15:11.460 --> 03:15:14.740]  kissing his sons and hugging his sons.
[03:15:14.740 --> 03:15:18.100]  And the idea that it's not just his sons, they're not the heir's apparent.
[03:15:18.100 --> 03:15:19.900]  Ivanka might be the heir apparent.
[03:15:19.900 --> 03:15:22.540]  She might be the one that he hands the keys over to.
[03:15:22.540 --> 03:15:26.460]  And just I can tell you, she's the one they're looking to be president about 20 years.
[03:15:26.460 --> 03:15:27.460]  She's got a shot.
[03:15:27.460 --> 03:15:28.460]  Absolutely.
[03:15:28.460 --> 03:15:33.260]  It's amazing, ladies and gentlemen, but a woman's success doesn't penalize men.
[03:15:33.260 --> 03:15:35.380]  A man's success doesn't penalize women.
[03:15:35.380 --> 03:15:37.660]  It's all our shared journey together.
[03:15:37.660 --> 03:15:38.660]  Straight ahead.

[03:19:55.700 --> 03:20:23.300]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:23.300 --> 03:20:28.980]  I appreciate the Foo Fighters as the walk up song, as the intro, the rejoin music.
[03:20:28.980 --> 03:20:32.580]  It's Matt Dubiel in for Alex Jones for the fourth hour.
[03:20:32.580 --> 03:20:39.980]  I am broadcasting from the WCKG studios here, it literally on the front lines.
[03:20:39.980 --> 03:20:45.940]  Now while I'm 20 minutes removed from the carnage that is Chicago, we are broadcasting
[03:20:45.940 --> 03:20:53.260]  from the AM 1530 WCKG studios where we carry, gosh, I'm so happy that infowars is put
[03:20:53.260 --> 03:20:54.260]  out.
[03:20:54.260 --> 03:20:55.260]  Some other shows.
[03:20:55.260 --> 03:20:59.500]  Alex is great, but when you're a station manager and you run a radio station, you're
[03:20:59.500 --> 03:21:01.620]  looking for more stuff to go with it.
[03:21:01.620 --> 03:21:07.380]  So then you look at the other shows that are out there and from 8 to 11, like the pickings
[03:21:07.380 --> 03:21:08.780]  are pretty slim.
[03:21:08.780 --> 03:21:13.620]  So you got like a Glen Beck and we tried that and it was just like, man, I don't know where
[03:21:13.620 --> 03:21:17.940]  this guy's going with the soccer balls and Ted Cruz and what the heck he's doing.
[03:21:17.940 --> 03:21:22.500]  He wants to be, you know, Deepak Chopra and Oprah, all the us.
[03:21:22.500 --> 03:21:28.780]  And so we bounced Glen and now we have David Knight on from 8 to 11 in the morning on FM
[03:21:28.780 --> 03:21:34.060]  102.3 here and AM 1530 and then the war room we have on from four to six.
[03:21:34.060 --> 03:21:39.820]  So it is a wall-to-wall lineup of info wars shows and we need it here in Chicago.
[03:21:39.820 --> 03:21:44.460]  Why is Chicago important to you even though you may not be in Chicago?
[03:21:44.460 --> 03:21:49.060]  Because Chicago is the sort of the litmus test for the rest of the country.
[03:21:49.060 --> 03:21:54.180]  If it happened in Detroit and then if it happens in Chicago, it's coming to a theater near
[03:21:54.180 --> 03:21:55.180]  you.
[03:21:55.180 --> 03:21:57.500]  And so these are the things you need to watch out for.
[03:21:57.500 --> 03:21:59.220]  I want to talk briefly.
[03:21:59.220 --> 03:22:07.140]  I want to map out the history of men dressing as women in the mainstream media because I
[03:22:07.140 --> 03:22:14.020]  think that it's important to dissect why this is now something that we all somehow accept
[03:22:14.020 --> 03:22:17.100]  as maybe just the way it is today.
[03:22:17.100 --> 03:22:21.300]  And so we're going to talk about that, but before we do, I do want to mention Michael
[03:22:21.300 --> 03:22:22.300]  Evans.
[03:22:22.300 --> 03:22:25.340]  Michael Evans, you may not have heard of Michael Evans.
[03:22:25.340 --> 03:22:30.540]  You probably will never hear about Michael Evans except for right now and right here on
[03:22:30.540 --> 03:22:31.540]  info wars.
[03:22:31.540 --> 03:22:38.460]  And the reason why is the Chicago death toll hit 562 people over the weekend.
[03:22:38.460 --> 03:22:45.500]  562 people have been shot and killed in Chicago in 2017.
[03:22:45.500 --> 03:22:51.460]  And there have been two new reported deaths and one man was gunned down last week and
[03:22:51.460 --> 03:22:55.540]  he's been identified as 30-year-old Michael Evans.
[03:22:55.540 --> 03:22:57.340]  You're never going to hear, look at him.
[03:22:57.340 --> 03:23:02.620]  He's on the screen if you're watching at infowars.com forward slash show, infowars.com
[03:23:02.620 --> 03:23:03.700]  slash show.
[03:23:03.700 --> 03:23:07.540]  He's a black man and he wasn't shot by a cop.
[03:23:07.540 --> 03:23:11.220]  So you're probably never going to get here, you're never going to hear about him.
[03:23:11.220 --> 03:23:19.420]  I will tell you, 14 people have now been shot and killed in the month of November in Chicago.
[03:23:19.420 --> 03:23:25.580]  It's Las Vegas in slow motion every month in Chicago.
[03:23:25.580 --> 03:23:32.380]  Las Vegas every month in slow motion.
[03:23:32.380 --> 03:23:34.220]  So it's not as sexy for the cameras.
[03:23:34.220 --> 03:23:36.620]  It's not as sexy for crybaby Kimmel.
[03:23:36.620 --> 03:23:37.860]  It's not as sexy for the media.
[03:23:37.860 --> 03:23:39.300]  It's not as sexy for the New York Times.
[03:23:39.300 --> 03:23:42.140]  It's not as sexy for CNN.
[03:23:42.140 --> 03:23:43.540]  There's not a lot of meat there.
[03:23:43.540 --> 03:23:46.780]  So they're not going to talk about Michael Evans, God bless Michael Evans.
[03:23:46.780 --> 03:23:52.940]  The governor who, by the way, so consider this, when you hear Alex Jones talking about
[03:23:52.940 --> 03:24:00.980]  the political system and the left-right paradigm and how this information is above the left-right
[03:24:00.980 --> 03:24:07.580]  paradigm stuff, realize that the mayor of Chicago is a Democrat.
[03:24:07.580 --> 03:24:10.860]  The governor is a Republican.
[03:24:10.860 --> 03:24:15.380]  And there's more murders in Chicago than ever before.
[03:24:15.380 --> 03:24:22.140]  Over 3,700 people have been just shot, not killed, but just shot in a calendar year in
[03:24:22.140 --> 03:24:23.640]  Chicago.
[03:24:23.640 --> 03:24:28.220]  If we take a look, and why is it important to you if you're in Florida?
[03:24:28.220 --> 03:24:32.260]  Why is it important to you if you're in Texas, if you're in Nevada, if you're in Arkansas,
[03:24:32.260 --> 03:24:35.060]  if you're in New York, if you're outside America?
[03:24:35.060 --> 03:24:38.020]  This is coming to a theater near you.
[03:24:38.020 --> 03:24:40.420]  It's coming to your local town.
[03:24:40.420 --> 03:24:43.020]  It's being engineered all around you.
[03:24:43.020 --> 03:24:49.140]  It is a result of the world that we live in, the BS laws that are in place, the protections
[03:24:49.140 --> 03:24:55.060]  for the criminals, and the provisions against the good guys.
[03:24:55.060 --> 03:25:00.900]  It's indicative of the paralyzed police officers who they really can't do their jobs like they
[03:25:00.900 --> 03:25:05.740]  could have, because they'll get sued or BLM will protest them, or the reference Jesse
[03:25:05.740 --> 03:25:11.860]  Jackson or the Jebedy Jebedy, Jebedy Jebedy, and Ratatat, Jesse Jackson will come on that
[03:25:11.860 --> 03:25:17.100]  doorstep for Al, I wanted to call him Al Roker.
[03:25:17.100 --> 03:25:18.620]  And then I almost wanted to call him Al Franken.
[03:25:18.620 --> 03:25:19.620]  Who's the other Al?
[03:25:19.620 --> 03:25:20.900]  What's the other guy's name?
[03:25:20.900 --> 03:25:22.780]  He does what Jesse Jackson does.
[03:25:22.780 --> 03:25:23.780]  He's the agitator.
[03:25:23.780 --> 03:25:26.020]  Al Sharpton, thank you.
[03:25:26.020 --> 03:25:27.020]  Not Al Franken.
[03:25:27.020 --> 03:25:28.580]  I mean, they're all in the same boat.
[03:25:28.580 --> 03:25:36.460]  I mean, Al Franken, you know, Roker, what was the Al, I mean, Sharpton, and he's a reverend,
[03:25:36.460 --> 03:25:37.460]  right?
[03:25:37.460 --> 03:25:41.380]  I love it how they're just honorary reverends, like they got it on the internet or something.
[03:25:41.380 --> 03:25:44.180]  I know guys, and you don't have to be black to do this.
[03:25:44.180 --> 03:25:46.580]  You can be black, white, Hispanic, brown, yellow, whatever.
[03:25:46.580 --> 03:25:50.980]  You go on the internet and you could get your degree, so you could call yourself a doctor,
[03:25:50.980 --> 03:25:54.580]  and you could go and get your certificate so that you could say that you're a minister
[03:25:54.580 --> 03:25:57.940]  or a reverend or whatever it is, and then you can marry people.
[03:25:57.940 --> 03:26:04.180]  But the reverend Al Sharpton, resists we much.
[03:26:04.180 --> 03:26:05.180]  He's nowhere to be seen.
[03:26:05.180 --> 03:26:07.420]  He's nowhere to be found.
[03:26:07.420 --> 03:26:15.060]  Him and Jesse Jackson, Jr., Jebedy Jebedy, Jebedy Jebedy, they're nowhere to be found.
[03:26:15.060 --> 03:26:20.580]  There's 14 people shot and killed in Chicago, almost all of them black, and those guys are
[03:26:20.580 --> 03:26:21.580]  nowhere to be found.
[03:26:21.580 --> 03:26:22.580]  You know where they're at?
[03:26:22.580 --> 03:26:27.900]  They're on the Wi-Fi right now, and they're watching their Xfinity or their, you know,
[03:26:27.900 --> 03:26:32.900]  they're talking to Alexa, they're doing their high-profile rich guy thing, because they make
[03:26:32.900 --> 03:26:39.500]  a lot of money off of the carnage that is the plight of not just the black man in Illinois
[03:26:39.500 --> 03:26:46.820]  and in Chicago and in America, but it's an income thing around the country.
[03:26:46.820 --> 03:26:53.020]  Governor Bruce Rounder, who's a Republican, Rounder, and his wife, Diana, are trying to
[03:26:53.020 --> 03:26:59.740]  make sure members of the military around the world receive holiday cards from people throughout
[03:26:59.740 --> 03:27:00.740]  Illinois.
[03:27:00.740 --> 03:27:03.300]  By the way, that's part of the news today.
[03:27:03.300 --> 03:27:12.380]  So poor Michael Evans, 30, shot and killed in Chicago, and what does Governor Rounder
[03:27:12.380 --> 03:27:13.900]  working on?
[03:27:13.900 --> 03:27:19.700]  Him and his wife are working on making sure that the military around the world receives
[03:27:19.700 --> 03:27:23.220]  holiday cards from people throughout Illinois.
[03:27:23.220 --> 03:27:29.060]  Now, a lot of my family has served, a lot of my family are veterans.
[03:27:29.060 --> 03:27:34.740]  I am not, I love all the veterans, my favorite, I posted this yesterday online, my favorite
[03:27:34.740 --> 03:27:40.140]  is my grandfather, who I'd never met, he didn't die on service, but he died after his service
[03:27:40.140 --> 03:27:41.140]  to our country.
[03:27:41.140 --> 03:27:42.140]  He's a veteran.
[03:27:42.140 --> 03:27:49.340]  Talked to my children about Veterans Day at the dinner table on Sunday, and was unfortunately
[03:27:49.340 --> 03:27:57.260]  not very shocked to find out that it was not discussed at school on Thursday or Friday.
[03:27:57.260 --> 03:28:00.260]  Veterans Day was not discussed in school.
[03:28:00.260 --> 03:28:05.340]  The governor's working on cards for the people in the service, but yet the school system
[03:28:05.340 --> 03:28:08.900]  isn't even talking about Veterans Day.
[03:28:08.900 --> 03:28:14.340]  And then we have people being shot in the streets, and the governors and the mayors
[03:28:14.340 --> 03:28:19.580]  aren't doing anything about it because they're working on making sure that people get cards
[03:28:19.580 --> 03:28:21.340]  in the mail.
[03:28:21.340 --> 03:28:25.660]  Talk to a veteran, talk to somebody who is active military, ask them if they gave a
[03:28:25.660 --> 03:28:30.540]  crap about getting a card in the mail, ask them what they prefer, and you'll find out
[03:28:30.540 --> 03:28:33.580]  that they care more about what's happening in the United States.
[03:28:33.580 --> 03:28:39.260]  We're gonna talk about how that's been dripped in, exactly how that agenda's been perpetrated
[03:28:39.260 --> 03:28:46.900]  through the media for men dressing as women, making it completely normal, and diminishing
[03:28:46.900 --> 03:28:51.700]  the status of the veterans coming up on InfoWars in for Alex Jones from Chicago.
[03:28:51.700 --> 03:29:20.700]  We're gonna talk about how that's been dripped through the media for men dressing as women.
[03:29:22.700 --> 03:29:24.900]  Why Numanna Storeable Foods?
[03:29:24.900 --> 03:29:26.620]  We believe in freedom.
[03:29:26.620 --> 03:29:30.740]  America needs strong independent families to endure what's ahead, and we take this charge
[03:29:30.740 --> 03:29:31.740]  seriously.

[03:29:53.500 --> 03:29:56.820]  America is an information-based civil war.
[03:29:56.820 --> 03:30:00.540]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these
[03:30:00.540 --> 03:30:04.220]  globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[03:30:04.220 --> 03:30:10.540]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[03:30:10.540 --> 03:30:16.580]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly
[03:30:16.580 --> 03:30:17.580]  the counterculture.
[03:30:17.580 --> 03:30:24.340]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom
[03:30:24.340 --> 03:30:27.060]  who at the same time is tolerant.
[03:30:27.060 --> 03:30:31.860]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[03:30:31.860 --> 03:30:37.180]  They are the anti-liberalists who defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote
[03:30:37.180 --> 03:30:38.180]  freedom worldwide.
[03:30:38.180 --> 03:30:43.700]  We've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as
[03:30:43.700 --> 03:30:47.340]  well as more Patriot Feral at infowarstore.com.
[03:30:47.340 --> 03:30:52.260]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at infowarstore.com.
[03:30:52.260 --> 03:30:58.620]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[03:30:58.620 --> 03:31:04.980]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[03:31:04.980 --> 03:31:12.220]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[03:31:12.220 --> 03:31:17.140]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer, and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[03:31:17.140 --> 03:31:18.140]  at infowarstore.com.
[03:31:18.140 --> 03:31:21.820]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best chloride-free toothpaste
[03:31:21.820 --> 03:31:26.980]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for
[03:31:26.980 --> 03:31:27.980]  children and adults.
[03:31:27.980 --> 03:31:32.180]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver
[03:31:32.180 --> 03:31:33.860]  and iodine as well.
[03:31:33.860 --> 03:31:48.700]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against
[03:31:48.700 --> 03:31:50.220]  us, so we need your support.
[03:31:50.220 --> 03:31:57.420]  If you go to infowarstore.com and get game-changing, amazing products, and we've been sold out
[03:31:57.420 --> 03:32:00.420]  of DNA force for almost four months.
[03:32:00.420 --> 03:32:03.460]  These ingredients are nutraceutical grade,
[03:32:03.460 --> 03:32:05.900]  the highest quality, the bio-PQQ, all of it.
[03:32:05.900 --> 03:32:07.380]  It's 25% off.
[03:32:07.380 --> 03:32:10.220]  The truck got in this morning and it's back,
[03:32:10.220 --> 03:32:12.860]  but it is a limited run because of all the testing
[03:32:12.860 --> 03:32:14.700]  and all the rest of it is the highest quality.
[03:32:14.700 --> 03:32:16.660]  Read about what it'll do for you and your family.
[03:32:16.660 --> 03:32:17.620]  It is amazing.
[03:32:17.620 --> 03:32:19.500]  We also have been sold out for three months
[03:32:19.500 --> 03:32:22.300]  on biome defense, super high quality probiotic.
[03:32:22.300 --> 03:32:25.980]  It's 25% off out of the gates, back in stock,
[03:32:25.980 --> 03:32:28.420]  but for a very limited time.
[03:32:28.420 --> 03:32:29.660]  So you get the highest quality,
[03:32:29.660 --> 03:32:31.180]  the very cleanest stuff out there.
[03:32:31.180 --> 03:32:32.380]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:32:32.380 --> 03:32:34.780]  DNA force and biome defense, probiotic.

[03:32:37.180 --> 03:32:38.860]  And when you buy products from globalists,
[03:32:38.860 --> 03:32:40.620]  it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[03:32:40.620 --> 03:32:42.260]  It is an act of war.
[03:32:42.260 --> 03:32:44.700]  It is an act of standing up when you spread the links,
[03:32:44.700 --> 03:32:46.540]  the articles and buy products from us.
[03:32:46.540 --> 03:32:49.660]  And then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[03:32:49.660 --> 03:32:50.940]  Hi.
[03:32:54.940 --> 03:32:57.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:04.980 --> 03:33:06.300]  Hola!
[03:33:12.260 --> 03:33:15.780]  From the front lines of the information war,
[03:33:15.780 --> 03:33:26.100]  It's Matt Dubeal filling in for Alex Jones, and I'm damn glad to be here from Chicago,
[03:33:26.100 --> 03:33:33.140]  from the front lines in Chicago where the death toll in 2017 is 14 for the month.
[03:33:33.140 --> 03:33:39.340]  We have 14 killed and shot in Chicago, 562 for the whole year so far.
[03:33:39.340 --> 03:33:41.300]  And it really is the front lines in Chicago.
[03:33:41.300 --> 03:33:48.540]  It's a preview of what's coming to American cities around the country, Detroit, the South,
[03:33:48.540 --> 03:33:50.620]  the West, the East.
[03:33:50.620 --> 03:33:52.260]  It's a warning.
[03:33:52.260 --> 03:33:58.820]  It's a warning to you in wherever you are that whether it's a Democratic mayor or a Republican
[03:33:58.820 --> 03:34:04.060]  mayor or a Democratic governor or a Republican governor, that they're not gonna be focusing
[03:34:04.060 --> 03:34:05.500]  on the right things.
[03:34:05.500 --> 03:34:09.580]  They're going to inevitably be focusing on the wrong things, whatever those things are
[03:34:09.580 --> 03:34:15.540]  that gets them in front of the feel good mainstream media that will write a story about them sending
[03:34:15.540 --> 03:34:17.060]  out cards to the veterans.
[03:34:17.060 --> 03:34:19.020]  The veterans don't need cards.
[03:34:19.020 --> 03:34:20.020]  You know what they need?
[03:34:20.020 --> 03:34:21.260]  They need better healthcare.
[03:34:21.260 --> 03:34:24.300]  They need not to be ignored when they get back to the United States of America.
[03:34:24.300 --> 03:34:30.140]  They need to not be held up as the scum of the country when they come back from serving
[03:34:30.140 --> 03:34:31.140]  us.
[03:34:31.140 --> 03:34:35.300]  They need to be put on a pedestal and aided in their transition from serving the country
[03:34:35.300 --> 03:34:38.020]  into adjusting to private life.
[03:34:38.020 --> 03:34:39.020]  That's what they need.
[03:34:39.020 --> 03:34:42.740]  They need to be treated like human beings deserve to be treated.
[03:34:42.740 --> 03:34:47.580]  The cards are a nice effort and it's a feel good and it gets a good headline, but it's
[03:34:47.580 --> 03:34:48.900]  not enough.
[03:34:48.900 --> 03:34:50.180]  Very important that you know this.
[03:34:50.180 --> 03:34:55.380]  There's some specials that have ended at infowarstore.com.
[03:34:55.380 --> 03:35:01.620]  They've ended some specials including 50% off all apparel and 50% off supermail vitality.
[03:35:01.620 --> 03:35:04.300]  Because it was so big, they had to cut it off.
[03:35:04.300 --> 03:35:06.500]  They say it's for a limited time and that's it.
[03:35:06.500 --> 03:35:09.140]  But here's what's available and here's why it's important.
[03:35:09.140 --> 03:35:15.300]  When Keith Richards is suffering from exhaustion, when you hear about Britney Spears being taken
[03:35:15.300 --> 03:35:18.740]  to the hospital and then they take her and they, oh, she's exhausted and we had to get
[03:35:18.740 --> 03:35:21.160]  her, we had to get her fluids and stuff.
[03:35:21.160 --> 03:35:23.980]  One of the fluids that they'll end up giving her, one of the vitamins they'll give her
[03:35:23.980 --> 03:35:27.100]  and or him and others is vitamin B12.
[03:35:27.100 --> 03:35:32.740]  I am a big believer in B12 and I've experienced it personally, I've gotten B12 injections
[03:35:32.740 --> 03:35:34.060]  and they really help you.
[03:35:34.060 --> 03:35:38.060]  If you're taking enough vitamin D, especially in the winter months, you get your vitamin
[03:35:38.060 --> 03:35:39.700]  D up because you're not getting it from the sun.
[03:35:39.700 --> 03:35:43.980]  You get the B12 in and before you know it, you're feeling like a human being and maybe
[03:35:43.980 --> 03:35:46.060]  even superhuman again.
[03:35:46.060 --> 03:35:50.780]  Secret 12 is the vitamin B that you can put under your tongue.
[03:35:50.780 --> 03:35:52.380]  They call it sublingual.

[03:35:58.420 --> 03:36:03.820]  So you might have heard Alex today talking about some, I don't know if you can say tranny
[03:36:03.820 --> 03:36:08.660]  on Facebook that it sounds like men in drag and tranny was banned by Facebook.
[03:36:08.660 --> 03:36:13.860]  So let's just call it what it is, grown men dressing as women.
[03:36:13.860 --> 03:36:19.580]  And grown men dressing up as women, grown men pretending to be women is something that is
[03:36:19.580 --> 03:36:20.740]  not new.
[03:36:20.740 --> 03:36:28.260]  It's been happening for hundreds and thousands of years and it's just actually been normalized
[03:36:28.260 --> 03:36:33.940]  though over the last 40 to 50 years and they've done it very systematically.
[03:36:33.940 --> 03:36:40.100]  And this is important to note, it doesn't mean that everybody who's participated in
[03:36:40.100 --> 03:36:49.220]  the movie or in the media is complicit in the sort of shift, the public consciousness
[03:36:49.220 --> 03:36:50.220]  shift.
[03:36:50.220 --> 03:36:53.380]  It doesn't mean that they all did it on purpose because I'm going to mention some things and
[03:36:53.380 --> 03:36:57.020]  you're going to go, wait a minute, so and so is a good dude and that guy's not a bad
[03:36:57.020 --> 03:37:01.380]  guy and I'm not saying that they're complicit in the architecture of it.
[03:37:01.380 --> 03:37:07.820]  But what happens is, is when it becomes popularized, then it's hijacked for their general mission.
[03:37:07.820 --> 03:37:10.860]  And I'm going to take you back to the beginning, right?
[03:37:10.860 --> 03:37:15.580]  Now imagine the 1950s and the 1960s.
[03:37:15.580 --> 03:37:19.620]  Imagine the world in the 1950s and the 1960s.
[03:37:19.620 --> 03:37:23.060]  Imagine the world of Ozzie and Harriet because that's pretty much the world that we lived
[03:37:23.060 --> 03:37:24.060]  in.
[03:37:24.060 --> 03:37:28.540]  There were four men who wore a suit and tie and they wore a fedora hat, much like a Jimmy
[03:37:28.540 --> 03:37:33.580]  Stewart in many of the movies, especially like It's a Wonderful Life.
[03:37:33.580 --> 03:37:40.060]  You had men that were white collar wearing suits and ties and hats, dressing like men.
[03:37:40.060 --> 03:37:45.620]  Then you had men that were blue collar and the blue collar men, this is very cliche,
[03:37:45.620 --> 03:37:50.260]  but they might have had some scruff and they might have had a uniform on.
[03:37:50.260 --> 03:37:52.880]  And those men looked like men.
[03:37:52.880 --> 03:37:59.140]  And if you showed them a man dressed as a woman, they would immediately reject that.
[03:37:59.140 --> 03:38:00.780]  So what happened?
[03:38:00.780 --> 03:38:07.020]  In 1959, there was a movie that came out with Tony Curtis and the movie was called Some
[03:38:07.020 --> 03:38:08.020]  Like It Hot.
[03:38:08.020 --> 03:38:09.100]  Now this is before my time.
[03:38:09.100 --> 03:38:12.540]  I was born in, I was born in the 70s, man.
[03:38:12.540 --> 03:38:16.580]  Some Like It Hot is a movie about a couple of guys dressing like women.
[03:38:16.580 --> 03:38:20.700]  Now here's what they did and here's how these ideas are transferred, okay?
[03:38:20.700 --> 03:38:24.700]  They don't just say that they're going to have them dressed like men for fun.
[03:38:24.700 --> 03:38:28.220]  Now the story is, well, what if they had to dress like men?
[03:38:28.220 --> 03:38:31.780]  What if there was a reason for these men to dress like women?
[03:38:31.780 --> 03:38:35.620]  And the reason is that they witnessed a mob hit.
[03:38:35.620 --> 03:38:38.420]  So now they're changing, they're shifting the idea.
[03:38:38.420 --> 03:38:44.340]  They're saying men of America, masculine men of America and women of America and elderly
[03:38:44.340 --> 03:38:49.220]  of America, would it be okay if men dressed as women?
[03:38:49.220 --> 03:38:55.060]  As long as it was for a good reason, like in this story where they're fleeing the mafia,
[03:38:55.060 --> 03:39:01.620]  two men witness a mob hit, they flee the mafia and they flee in an all-female band.
[03:39:01.620 --> 03:39:07.100]  So they had to dress as women to disguise themselves as part of the all-female band.
[03:39:07.100 --> 03:39:08.340]  That was the ruse.
[03:39:08.340 --> 03:39:10.900]  It was for survival.
[03:39:10.900 --> 03:39:14.980]  Is it okay to dress like a woman if it's for survival?
[03:39:14.980 --> 03:39:20.300]  And most rational men and women would say, well, okay, I suppose that if you're dressing
[03:39:20.300 --> 03:39:25.060]  like a woman to survive, it would be okay to dress like a woman.
[03:39:25.060 --> 03:39:29.140]  It would not be okay to dress like a woman for fun.
[03:39:29.140 --> 03:39:34.500]  It would not be okay to dress like a woman if you're teaching class or if you're working
[03:39:34.500 --> 03:39:39.060]  your day job at the ad agency or if you're working on Wall Street or if you're working
[03:39:39.060 --> 03:39:44.900]  in the union stockyards or if you're installing electricity, you can't dress like a woman there.
[03:39:44.900 --> 03:39:51.620]  Not for fun, but if you watch some like it hot, the message is that it's okay to dress
[03:39:51.620 --> 03:39:57.300]  like women if you're a man, if it's for survival.
[03:39:57.300 --> 03:40:01.900]  And so they let that idea sort of simmer and that idea kind of just sat there and people
[03:40:01.900 --> 03:40:04.500]  watched the movie.
[03:40:04.500 --> 03:40:11.980]  Fast forward to 1982, 1982, a movie came out with Dustin Hoffman, the graduate.
[03:40:11.980 --> 03:40:17.260]  And by the way, it is never a coincidence that the men that dress up as the women in
[03:40:17.260 --> 03:40:23.260]  the movies are some of the most masculine and revered men playing some of the most masculine
[03:40:23.260 --> 03:40:24.660]  roles ever played.
[03:40:24.660 --> 03:40:31.260]  Now, Dustin Hoffman in the graduate played a young man who bedded an older woman, which
[03:40:31.260 --> 03:40:37.820]  was a fantasy of many young men who as a young man in that time wouldn't have loved to have
[03:40:37.820 --> 03:40:42.020]  an older attractive woman be interested in them.
[03:40:42.020 --> 03:40:48.740]  And now in 1982, that same young man who in 1967 was everybody's fan.
[03:40:48.740 --> 03:40:51.740]  They wanted to be him in 1967.
[03:40:51.740 --> 03:40:59.940]  Now in 1982, Dustin Hoffman is playing Tootsie, a man that dresses like a woman.
[03:40:59.940 --> 03:41:01.540]  But not for fun.
[03:41:01.540 --> 03:41:02.700]  He's not doing it for fun.
[03:41:02.700 --> 03:41:04.660]  This is an important distinction.
[03:41:04.660 --> 03:41:07.020]  It's not a pleasurable experience.
[03:41:07.020 --> 03:41:10.260]  That is too weird for mainstream America.
[03:41:10.260 --> 03:41:12.140]  They're escalating you, okay?
[03:41:12.140 --> 03:41:19.620]  So first, Tony Curtis, a very masculine man with a very square jaw, revered by men and
[03:41:19.620 --> 03:41:21.120]  women.
[03:41:21.120 --> 03:41:24.540]  Tony Curtis dresses as a woman, along with, is that Jack?
[03:41:24.540 --> 03:41:26.740]  I think it's Jack Lemon.
[03:41:26.740 --> 03:41:31.020]  Tony Curtis and Jack Lemon, for crying out loud, are dressing like women.
[03:41:31.020 --> 03:41:36.460]  And it's okay because in the movie, their characters are dressing like women.
[03:41:36.460 --> 03:41:37.460]  Why?
[03:41:37.460 --> 03:41:38.460]  To escape the mob.
[03:41:38.460 --> 03:41:39.460]  So it's for survival.
[03:41:39.460 --> 03:41:40.460]  It's cool.
[03:41:40.460 --> 03:41:41.700]  Survival is cool.
[03:41:41.700 --> 03:41:42.700]  It's cool.
[03:41:42.700 --> 03:41:45.300]  Dressing like a woman is cool if you're trying to survive.
[03:41:45.300 --> 03:41:50.900]  B, secondly, in the movie Tootsie, why is Dustin Hoffman dressing like a woman?
[03:41:50.900 --> 03:41:54.060]  He's dressing like a woman, again, for survival.
[03:41:54.060 --> 03:41:55.820]  He can't get a job.
[03:41:55.820 --> 03:41:56.820]  He cannot get a job.
[03:41:56.820 --> 03:41:58.260]  He can't get hired.
[03:41:58.260 --> 03:41:59.700]  They're cutting back.
[03:41:59.700 --> 03:42:00.980]  You gotta be a woman to work.
[03:42:00.980 --> 03:42:03.060]  I think he was in the newsroom.
[03:42:03.060 --> 03:42:10.260]  And in order for him to actually, oh no, he's an unsuccessful actor in the movie, in order
[03:42:10.260 --> 03:42:15.020]  for him to get work, he has to dress like a woman.
[03:42:15.020 --> 03:42:18.140]  My friend, it does not stop there.
[03:42:18.140 --> 03:42:19.860]  It does not stop there.
[03:42:19.860 --> 03:42:20.860]  This is just the beginning.
[03:42:20.860 --> 03:42:22.700]  I'm gonna take you all the way through it.
[03:42:22.700 --> 03:42:27.800]  And you're going to see, yep, yep, look at the screen, infowars.com slash show.

[03:42:30.300 --> 03:42:32.140]  It's just the tip of the iceberg.
[03:42:32.140 --> 03:42:34.540]  Dave Chappelle witnessed it firsthand.
[03:42:34.540 --> 03:42:36.100]  Others have talked about it.
[03:42:36.100 --> 03:42:39.180]  You're going to realize that it's everywhere.

[03:47:04.740 --> 03:47:18.740]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:18.740 --> 03:47:24.260]  My name is Matt Dubiel, at Matt on Air on Twitter.
[03:47:24.260 --> 03:47:28.460]  I don't tweet much, but if there's a place where you can find me or follow me, you might
[03:47:28.460 --> 03:47:29.460]  want to do it there.
[03:47:29.460 --> 03:47:33.860]  Broadcasting from the WCKG studios here in Chicago, we carry Alex Jones.
[03:47:33.860 --> 03:47:36.580]  We carry Real News with David Knight.
[03:47:36.580 --> 03:47:44.540]  What I'm talking about today on the heels of this phenomenon of men wearing dresses,
[03:47:44.540 --> 03:47:50.140]  men pretending to be women in mainstream America, have just been sort of outlining my observation
[03:47:50.140 --> 03:47:56.140]  about the sort of escalation of this concept into the mainstream.
[03:47:56.140 --> 03:48:01.100]  It started as far as I can tell right about 1959.
[03:48:01.100 --> 03:48:06.940]  I'm glad that we're talking about it, infowars.com slash show if you want to see visually what
[03:48:06.940 --> 03:48:09.620]  we're talking about.
[03:48:09.620 --> 03:48:13.180]  One of the things that happens when you start talking about ideas, this is one of the reasons
[03:48:13.180 --> 03:48:19.580]  why things really, it really is an Info War, such a brilliant title, such a brilliant idea
[03:48:19.580 --> 03:48:26.740]  is that the information has been seeping into the consciousness of America and thereby the
[03:48:26.740 --> 03:48:30.380]  rest of the world because America sets the tone for the rest of the world when it comes
[03:48:30.380 --> 03:48:31.380]  to entertainment.
[03:48:31.380 --> 03:48:33.660]  So here's how it started, at least as early as I can tell.
[03:48:33.660 --> 03:48:37.460]  We could go back sooner and we can find more examples, I'm sure, but it really hit its
[03:48:37.460 --> 03:48:42.140]  stride in 1959 in the movies with some like it hot where they had Tony Curtis and Jack
[03:48:42.140 --> 03:48:47.460]  Lemon dressing as women and the idea was it's okay for them to dress as women because it's
[03:48:47.460 --> 03:48:50.100]  for survival.
[03:48:50.100 --> 03:48:53.540]  They're not doing it for fun, they're doing it to survive, so there's nothing wrong with
[03:48:53.540 --> 03:48:54.540]  it.
[03:48:54.540 --> 03:48:58.380]  Okay, that idea seeps into the consciousness of men and women in America and the rest
[03:48:58.380 --> 03:48:59.380]  of the world.
[03:48:59.380 --> 03:49:05.380]  Jim, one of our producers and pretty much a jack of all trades here at WCKG, popped
[03:49:05.380 --> 03:49:08.900]  in and he said, what about Psycho, the movie Psycho in 1960?
[03:49:08.900 --> 03:49:15.700]  Yes, Norman, Norman, Norman dressed as his mother, he dressed as a woman and killed people.
[03:49:15.700 --> 03:49:21.500]  Now that took it in a weird direction, but Psycho was such a breakthrough hit that that
[03:49:21.500 --> 03:49:27.180]  took dressing as a woman, again, into your mind, into the subconscious of Americans
[03:49:27.180 --> 03:49:33.860]  as this is something that people on TV, people on the movies, they're doing it and if you're
[03:49:33.860 --> 03:49:39.380]  doing it for a cause, if you're doing it for something, it's not as weird, it's not as weird
[03:49:39.380 --> 03:49:40.380]  for some reason.
[03:49:40.380 --> 03:49:47.140]  Then you jump to 1982, 1982, Dustin Hoffman plays a character and the character is can't
[03:49:47.140 --> 03:49:54.180]  get work and since he can't get work, he's in there with Jessica Lange and by the way,
[03:49:54.180 --> 03:49:59.180]  he's always, always, always masculine, revered actors and characters that have played other
[03:49:59.180 --> 03:50:04.460]  roles that have really touched you, they've really found a place in your heart.
[03:50:04.460 --> 03:50:12.700]  So Dustin Hoffman was the graduate before that and then in 1967, fast forward to 1982,
[03:50:12.700 --> 03:50:19.220]  Dustin Hoffman is an unsuccessful actor and then you listen to the subtext of this really
[03:50:19.220 --> 03:50:26.220]  is the unsuccessful guy has to dress as a woman, but people kind of miss that, okay?
[03:50:26.220 --> 03:50:32.980]  They miss out on that part, unsuccessful man has to dress as woman in order to get work.
[03:50:32.980 --> 03:50:37.300]  How about instead of dressing like, well, you just become successful, force yourself
[03:50:37.300 --> 03:50:45.700]  to be successful, but the real headline that most people gloved onto here is it's okay
[03:50:45.700 --> 03:50:52.420]  to dress as a woman, Dustin Hoffman says it's okay, the idea is okay, the movie theater
[03:50:52.420 --> 03:50:58.100]  says it's okay, the commercial on ABC, CBS and NBC says it's okay, they're showing it
[03:50:58.100 --> 03:51:01.620]  everywhere, they're promoting the movie everywhere, it might have won some awards, it might have
[03:51:01.620 --> 03:51:04.780]  won an Oscar, who knows?
[03:51:04.780 --> 03:51:12.100]  And that normalizes this behavior and the subtext there is, well, he's trying to get work,
[03:51:12.100 --> 03:51:17.480]  so that makes it okay and that gives it a reason, he's not doing it for fun, we're
[03:51:17.480 --> 03:51:22.060]  skipping over the fun part, there's guys that like to do this for fun, but we're not ready
[03:51:22.060 --> 03:51:23.620]  for that, okay?
[03:51:23.620 --> 03:51:30.740]  So then we jump ahead to 1980 and I remember this because I was a TV kid in the 80s watching
[03:51:30.740 --> 03:51:35.460]  too much television and I remember the show with Tom Hanks and the other guy, I don't
[03:51:35.460 --> 03:51:41.380]  remember the other guy's name, and they couldn't get an apartment, I believe it was like in
[03:51:41.380 --> 03:51:48.620]  Rent Control, New York, so the show is called Buzzing Buddies, so they dressed like women,
[03:51:48.620 --> 03:51:55.580]  Tom Hanks and the other actor dressed like women in order to get an apartment, okay?
[03:51:55.580 --> 03:51:57.060]  So are you following me here?
[03:51:57.060 --> 03:52:01.820]  It's okay to dress like a woman if you need to survive from the mob, it's okay to dress
[03:52:01.820 --> 03:52:07.340]  like a woman if you need to get work, now it's okay, we're escalating it, it's okay to dress
[03:52:07.340 --> 03:52:12.660]  like a woman, yeah, Peter Scowari and Tom Hanks, Peter didn't make it but Tom Hanks
[03:52:12.660 --> 03:52:18.540]  did and he probably was even more elevated because he was willing to do this show, they
[03:52:18.540 --> 03:52:25.780]  wanted to put the show out for whatever reason, now it's okay to dress like a woman in order
[03:52:25.780 --> 03:52:32.700]  to get an apartment and of course hilarity ensues and the comedy ensues, it is a funny
[03:52:32.700 --> 03:52:38.300]  situation to put people into and that is the excuse to do it, is they're going, well, it's
[03:52:38.300 --> 03:52:43.100]  funny, it's so funny, it's just funny, it's just so hilarious, so what we do is we take
[03:52:43.100 --> 03:52:48.100]  the two guys and we put them in these crazy situations but they're dressed as women, so
[03:52:48.100 --> 03:52:52.140]  they're pretending to be women but they're really men and you can see their five o'clock
[03:52:52.140 --> 03:52:58.500]  shadow and they're on TV once a week, every week and by the way, back then there was only
[03:52:58.500 --> 03:53:05.580]  three channels, there was not 300 channels, you couldn't put on Hulu and Netflix, this
[03:53:05.580 --> 03:53:10.180]  was all you could watch and it's seeping in into mainstream America, everybody's watching
[03:53:10.180 --> 03:53:14.100]  this stuff, with Dukes of Hazard by the way, so you got Dukes of Hazard, you got Buzzing
[03:53:14.100 --> 03:53:20.860]  Buddies, thank you, fast forward to again and then you got the movie Lentil with, we gotta
[03:53:20.860 --> 03:53:27.620]  mix it up a little bit, so we get Barbara Streisand dressing as a man, again, for I think it's
[03:53:27.620 --> 03:53:32.540]  survival in that movie, I'm not too sure but there's a reason, it's not for fun, none
[03:53:32.540 --> 03:53:35.500]  of this is for fun or recreation.
[03:53:35.500 --> 03:53:41.380]  Now Jen mentioned The Crying Game which came out in 1992 and I have to admit, I didn't
[03:53:41.380 --> 03:53:47.040]  see it, I just heard everybody people joking about The Crying Game because I think something
[03:53:47.040 --> 03:53:52.720]  happens in The Crying Game where a man maybe ends up with, he's with a woman that he didn't
[03:53:52.720 --> 03:53:59.260]  know was a woman or something like that, so now we're escalating the situation, it's a
[03:53:59.260 --> 03:54:06.220]  very different situation, it's transitioning pun intended, we're transitioning from men
[03:54:06.220 --> 03:54:07.560]  and dresses.
[03:54:07.560 --> 03:54:14.540]  Now here's something that's interesting, listen to what Dave Chappelle has to say in an interview
[03:54:14.540 --> 03:54:18.060]  with Oprah and I can't believe that Oprah, by the way this was Oprah before Oprah was
[03:54:18.060 --> 03:54:23.540]  completely compromised or whatever, where Oprah actually takes a listen to what Dave
[03:54:23.540 --> 03:54:28.620]  Chappelle has to say and watch her reaction, she doesn't poo poo it, she doesn't say, oh
[03:54:28.620 --> 03:54:32.380]  Dave, well that's just the way Hollywood is, she actually listens to it and Dave Chappelle
[03:54:32.380 --> 03:54:37.900]  talks about the writers and producers trying to get him to wear a dress in a movie after
[03:54:37.900 --> 03:54:41.380]  he was already successful, go ahead and roll that if you can.
[03:54:41.380 --> 03:54:48.260]  I mean I'm a conspiracy theorist to a degree, like when I connect dots that maybe shouldn't
[03:54:48.260 --> 03:54:53.020]  be connected, I don't know, but certain dots like when I see that they put every black man
[03:54:53.020 --> 03:54:57.020]  in the movies in a dress at some point in career, I'll be connecting them, they're like, well
[03:54:57.020 --> 03:55:02.500]  all these brats are gonna wear a dress, this happened to me, I'm doing a movie with Martin,
[03:55:02.500 --> 03:55:07.020]  the movie's going good, so I walk on a trailer, I'm like man this must be the wrong trailer
[03:55:07.020 --> 03:55:14.500]  because there's a dress in here, look at Oprah's face, look at Oprah's face, the writer
[03:55:14.500 --> 03:55:19.660]  comes in, I think he's writing, he's like Dave listen, you've got this hilarious scene
[03:55:19.660 --> 03:55:25.700]  where Martin's sneaking out of jail, so he disguises you as a prostitute, okay so can
[03:55:25.700 --> 03:55:31.060]  we pause it for a second, I don't want to continue from there, okay so the writer, you
[03:55:31.060 --> 03:55:36.900]  know this is how it starts and you saw Oprah's face, now they're trying to get, and in the
[03:55:36.900 --> 03:55:44.660]  prelude, the preview to that was Dave Chappelle saying that he noticed that all of these successful
[03:55:44.660 --> 03:55:50.700]  masculine, and he was speaking to black actors and celebrities, and he was saying, I noticed
[03:55:50.700 --> 03:55:54.860]  that they were doing this with all of these big stars that are black, they're always
[03:55:54.860 --> 03:55:59.620]  ending up wearing dresses, and then he segues into telling Oprah that this has happened,
[03:55:59.620 --> 03:56:03.180]  and then you see Oprah kind of looking, back then Oprah looked at this sort of thing and
[03:56:03.180 --> 03:56:08.580]  went wait a minute, try and see a segment where Oprah talks about this now, she's gonna
[03:56:08.580 --> 03:56:12.100]  have a different reaction and a different attitude, why?
[03:56:12.100 --> 03:56:17.180]  Because it's been escalated, it's completely been altered, everybody even Oprah's position
[03:56:17.180 --> 03:56:23.380]  on this has been changed by the media, and by the perpetuation of this, I'm not gonna
[03:56:23.380 --> 03:56:29.740]  have enough time to probably play the rest of that clip, but then you got Priscilla,
[03:56:29.740 --> 03:56:35.980]  the queen of the desert, Tu Wang Fu, with love, Julie Neumar in 1995, White Chicks,
[03:56:35.980 --> 03:56:42.140]  and before that in 1993, I'm sorry I'm jumping around guys, but in 1993 you had Mrs. Doubtfire.
[03:56:42.140 --> 03:56:48.060]  Now again, in the storyline of Mrs. Doubtfire, it's totally cool to dress like a woman if
[03:56:48.060 --> 03:56:50.860]  it's so you can see your kids.
[03:56:50.860 --> 03:56:57.340]  If dad has to do that so that he can see his kids, because some wacko judge told him that
[03:56:57.340 --> 03:57:02.140]  he can't see his kids, well then, I mean, who can't identify with that?
[03:57:02.140 --> 03:57:07.260]  I would do almost whatever I could to see my kids, how can you not relate to that?
[03:57:07.260 --> 03:57:08.860]  You see what's happening?
[03:57:08.860 --> 03:57:11.060]  You see the progression?
[03:57:11.060 --> 03:57:17.540]  It's now, it's probably okay to a lot of people, well, what's the harm if you're just
[03:57:17.540 --> 03:57:23.100]  dressing like, why not teach people to dress like women for fun even if they're men?
[03:57:23.100 --> 03:57:24.100]  Why not?
[03:57:24.100 --> 03:57:25.100]  What's the harm?
[03:57:25.100 --> 03:57:27.940]  It's been escalated for so long.
[03:57:27.940 --> 03:57:31.700]  Go back and look at the history of the motion picture and entertainment industry, and you'll
[03:57:31.700 --> 03:57:35.940]  see from hair bands to Tony Curtis, it's been orchestrated.
[03:57:35.940 --> 03:57:41.060]  Whether on purpose or by accident, either way, it's been happening with men in dresses
[03:57:41.060 --> 03:57:43.620]  manipulating you.
[03:57:43.620 --> 03:57:56.140]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
