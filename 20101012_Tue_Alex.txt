[00:20.840 --> 00:35.240]  we are live my friends it is Tuesday the 12th day of October 2010 we had him on a
[00:35.240 --> 00:39.760]  few weeks ago he's going to pop back in for an hour Alex Abaya one of the few
[00:39.760 --> 00:43.320]  people to ever be given access to the Rand Corporation one of the key
[00:43.320 --> 00:50.280]  globalist think tanks that is charting much of the architecture of this global
[00:50.280 --> 00:55.120]  government that is being formed he is coming up the next hour we're going to
[00:55.120 --> 01:00.760]  cover a raft of vital news and information today the controlled
[01:00.760 --> 01:05.520]  implosion of the global economy is obviously accelerating and the
[01:05.520 --> 01:12.160]  architects of this system are calling for a global syndicate of banks the ones
[01:12.160 --> 01:16.320]  that have created the very crisis we're in to be allowed to set interest rates
[01:16.320 --> 01:21.480]  globally control currencies and tax the world population so we're going to be
[01:21.480 --> 01:26.360]  going over that after the break Paul Joseph Watson has the key article up at
[01:26.360 --> 01:34.640]  prisonplanet.com government prepares to seize private pensions and CNBC is
[01:34.640 --> 01:39.040]  reporting how wonderful this is many other mainstream publications are now
[01:39.040 --> 01:43.320]  rolling out but we told you five years ago they were planning to do when they
[01:43.320 --> 01:48.000]  began to change the laws and regulations ahead of this and of course that
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.880]  integrates back into the March article five six months ago failed banks may get
[01:53.880 --> 02:00.080]  pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash and then you read the article it says
[02:00.080 --> 02:04.320]  they're already and this was earlier this year ordering major private pension
[02:04.320 --> 02:08.720]  systems to quote invest as if the federal government can order but they are
[02:08.720 --> 02:14.000]  to give them an offer they can't refuse because the federal regulators can
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.400]  basically nickel and diamond shut them down anytime they want they're telling
[02:17.400 --> 02:22.120]  them you will invest in failed banks so they've already stolen most the money
[02:22.120 --> 02:27.520]  they're now just getting you ready for the public theft when the pension funds
[02:27.520 --> 02:33.840]  all start going down completely or you're getting into serious trouble and
[02:33.840 --> 02:37.760]  having your benefits cut they're preparing you for the austerity measures
[02:37.760 --> 02:41.560]  when the government takes over the pensions in the name of bailing them
[02:41.560 --> 02:46.200]  out in the name of protecting them yes protecting them so we're going to be
[02:46.200 --> 02:49.880]  discussing that and going over exactly what's happening other parts of the
[02:49.880 --> 02:55.720]  world Europe is already about two years ahead of us in this French workers
[02:55.720 --> 02:59.920]  threatened general strike in response to austerity cuts in their pay increases in
[02:59.920 --> 03:05.280]  taxes massive cuts in their government and private pensions now it's all
[03:05.280 --> 03:10.280]  ready happening key article by Kurt Nemo today and he links to the London
[03:10.280 --> 03:14.520]  Guardian and other reports going over this here's another incredible report
[03:14.520 --> 03:19.560]  out yesterday Greek health system ops for amputation as money saver they will
[03:19.560 --> 03:25.480]  not give any treatments to try to save arms or legs with diabetes patients
[03:25.480 --> 03:29.000]  they're just going to chop your arms and legs off even though the limbs are
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.080]  savable and all the studies show that will lead to an early death of these
[03:33.080 --> 03:38.160]  people and more money in the health care system but this is the death panels now
[03:38.160 --> 03:43.280]  being announced here in the United States part of austerity also US cities
[03:43.280 --> 03:47.480]  face half a trillion dollars of pension deficits so they're already going bankrupt
[03:47.480 --> 03:52.960]  there with the police and fire and school teacher pensions it's all been
[03:52.960 --> 03:56.400]  planned we've let it out with total precision because we've seen the global
[03:56.400 --> 03:59.480]  let's do this and countless third world countries which the IMF World Bank
[03:59.480 --> 04:04.280]  documents that got leaked in 2002 the BBC showed that was just test model cases
[04:04.280 --> 04:08.960]  in Argentina and Nigeria and places like that now they were planning to do it in

[04:13.040 --> 04:19.640]  quote Western wealthy nations the mass looting is now here you think you've
[04:19.640 --> 04:24.800]  seen trillion stolen by the banks you think watching six million dead and

[04:29.640 --> 04:34.760]  and Operation Iraqi Freedom you think it's bold to steal their death benefits
[04:34.760 --> 04:37.880]  and not give the insurance money that they paid for to their widows and
[04:37.880 --> 04:43.520]  widowers you think that's bold we ain't seen nothing yet they're getting ready

[06:11.680 --> 06:15.320]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in its
[06:15.320 --> 06:20.360]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[06:20.360 --> 06:25.720]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[06:25.720 --> 06:30.640]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[06:30.640 --> 06:35.040]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[06:38.760 --> 06:42.720]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[06:42.720 --> 06:48.240]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[07:00.680 --> 07:04.040]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[07:04.040 --> 07:08.320]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[07:08.320 --> 07:12.480]  your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[07:12.480 --> 07:16.560]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[07:16.560 --> 07:20.920]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[07:20.920 --> 07:25.000]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.560]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:29.560 --> 07:33.680]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:33.680 --> 07:37.640]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[07:37.640 --> 07:41.440]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:41.440 --> 07:44.160]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[07:44.160 --> 07:50.160]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[08:00.320 --> 08:08.600]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:11.600 --> 08:19.200]  it is Tuesday the twelfth day of October 2010 they're issuing new terror
[08:19.200 --> 08:24.560]  threats ahead of the election right on time not just for Europe but for the
[08:24.560 --> 08:29.960]  United States New York Daily News terror threat to restaurants as Al Qaeda you
[08:29.960 --> 08:36.640]  mean LCI ADA calls for attacks on government workers in DC but don't
[08:36.640 --> 08:42.880]  worry the government run by the banks that are literally scalping our
[08:42.880 --> 08:50.120]  financial system and our economy don't worry they are going to keep you safe
[08:50.120 --> 08:54.800]  with submachine guns and naked body scanners and checkpoints and citizen
[08:54.800 --> 09:00.240]  spies over 95% of the entire architecture of this high-tech police
[09:00.240 --> 09:04.960]  state grid is pointed at gun owners conservatives libertarians land rights
[09:04.960 --> 09:12.200]  activists but that's okay Al Qaeda is gonna get you that's why a tiny bit of
[09:12.200 --> 09:17.200]  it is spent on surveilling Muslims and what people could call Muslim
[09:17.200 --> 09:22.120]  extremist and there certainly are some fruit loops out there and every time
[09:22.120 --> 09:24.920]  they catch one of them trying to plan a shooting or something they hype it up
[09:24.920 --> 09:28.280]  like it's the end of the world meanwhile the crime wave pouring across from
[09:28.280 --> 09:32.640]  Mexico that's just kept on the kept on the back burner the 28,000 deaths the
[09:32.640 --> 09:36.400]  massive murders and kidnappings in the United States that's that's not a
[09:36.400 --> 09:40.000]  problem that's not a threat no it's those evil gun owners you've got to watch
[09:40.000 --> 09:46.440]  so we're gonna be going over those reports today the US says they're
[09:46.440 --> 09:51.160]  alarmed by harsh tone of China's military well China owns most of our
[09:51.160 --> 09:54.720]  debt after that the private Federal Reserve and I just I've got an article
[09:54.720 --> 09:59.400]  here about hundreds of thousands of acres being leased in South Texas for
[09:59.400 --> 10:04.360]  oil drilling and gas drilling by the communist Chinese government so if
[10:04.360 --> 10:07.720]  there's such a big threat why are they allowed to do that but see even the
[10:07.720 --> 10:12.720]  headlines deceptive US alarmed by harsh tone of China's military our country
[10:12.720 --> 10:16.440]  was conquered in 1913 by the private banking syndicate since then they've
[10:16.440 --> 10:20.480]  expanded their control over the states and locales and they're looting the
[10:20.480 --> 10:25.400]  nation and so to even say the US even exists anymore as a lie you've got to
[10:25.400 --> 10:29.880]  admit we are under globalist control so that we can point out that it's
[10:29.880 --> 10:34.200]  fraudulent and illegitimate but if you don't know you're occupied by a
[10:34.200 --> 10:37.360]  corporate government by a shadow government that's now coming out into
[10:37.360 --> 10:42.760]  the open if you don't admit that you can never set about remedying it instead we
[10:42.760 --> 10:47.200]  just rearranged deck chairs of well we'll put Obama in because Bush was bad
[10:47.200 --> 10:54.320]  well we'll put Mitt Romney or Sarah Palin in they'll save us really don't
[10:54.320 --> 10:58.680]  hold your breath you'll hear a lot of rhetoric but once they get in they
[10:58.680 --> 11:02.560]  won't reverse but maybe a few token things and then expand a bunch of other
[11:02.560 --> 11:11.160]  police state operations it was Lord Bush just what five years ago and the
[11:11.160 --> 11:16.120]  Republicans and Democrats in the Congress that changed the law and the
[11:16.120 --> 11:20.480]  regulations so that I remember seeing this in the news they were pitching it
[11:20.480 --> 11:26.160]  like it was good so that private pension funds corporations can sell off their
[11:26.160 --> 11:30.720]  assets or create a new subsidiary and then not pay the pensions to the
[11:30.720 --> 11:36.160]  employees that signed contracts and agreements for those pensions boy that
[11:36.160 --> 11:41.840]  was a big red flag and now it's just all continuing under Barack Hussein Obama
[11:41.840 --> 11:47.240]  real name Barry Sataro but I forgot the gatekeeper Republican talk show host
[11:47.240 --> 11:51.160]  have told us that there's no evidence that he's really Indonesian or gave up
[11:51.160 --> 11:53.720]  his citizenship even though it's an admitted fact or that he was born in
[11:53.720 --> 11:57.440]  Kenya and so you're supposed to sit there and shut up and sit down of course
[11:57.440 --> 12:00.360]  the same people told us five years ago there was no plan for world government
[12:00.360 --> 12:05.120]  but I heard becks fill in host to admitting world government this morning
[12:05.120 --> 12:09.360]  but it's all run by George Soros and some low-level liberals under him no
[12:09.360 --> 12:15.960]  George Soros is one wing of this criminal system and media matters put out a
[12:15.960 --> 12:21.360]  report just a few days ago that was one of the only accurate things I've ever
[12:21.360 --> 12:25.400]  seen him put out George Soros funded outfit and they said well if you're
[12:25.400 --> 12:29.160]  against Fabian socialist you should be against all these Republicans who've
[12:29.160 --> 12:33.600]  signed on to the same plan and they listed all the Fabian socialist
[12:33.600 --> 12:39.000]  supporters in the Republican Party tied into the London School of Economics but
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.440]  by the way you guys removed yesterday's stacks which is great but will you dig
[12:44.440 --> 12:48.920]  out those articles trying to blame myself and Glenn Beck for that guy that
[12:48.920 --> 12:53.840]  gotten a shootout with the police in Southern California who now gave an
[12:53.840 --> 12:57.480]  interview to media matters of course because they're basically a government
[12:57.480 --> 13:03.680]  operation all the evidence shows and I got a call from their their head editor
[13:03.680 --> 13:09.320]  the head guy over there and it was a bizarre interview and then he kept
[13:09.320 --> 13:13.880]  saying you want you didn't record this did you and he said even if it's one
[13:13.880 --> 13:21.040]  party consent states that were both in you are you are you know really
[13:21.040 --> 13:26.240]  shouldn't record me I said I just told you I didn't record you and then he
[13:26.240 --> 13:29.680]  didn't seem to believe that and it was a very strange interview he was acting
[13:29.680 --> 13:34.520]  all friendly but obviously I knew better you know what I thought why don't we try
[13:34.520 --> 13:40.840]  to get that guy on in fact give me his email and bio Joe whatever his name is
[13:40.840 --> 13:44.440]  because I'm gonna talk about it coming up in the last hour a little bit because
[13:44.440 --> 13:50.000]  it was so bizarre talking to this George Soros outfit he was saying well we're
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.360]  not funded by George Soros so I was pulling up federal filings that okay
[13:54.360 --> 14:01.360]  George Soros gave money to move on org that gave money and helped found in 2005
[14:01.360 --> 14:07.680]  media matters and he was like well I don't want to talk about that I mean
[14:07.680 --> 14:11.600]  they play all these little games but then it got even stranger and I'll talk
[14:11.600 --> 14:16.120]  about it more in the next hour but or actually the last hour the third hour
[14:16.120 --> 14:21.640]  perhaps we should call him today just see if we can get Joe on because because
[14:21.640 --> 14:26.760]  he kept saying well Glenn Beck has been calling for violence and I said well show
[14:26.760 --> 14:30.400]  me where show me in your article he says well it's right here so I sat there on
[14:30.400 --> 14:33.520]  the phone with him for an hour I read the whole article that they've written
[14:33.520 --> 14:37.760]  it was like 20 pages long with him on the phone and nowhere to Glenn Beck call
[14:37.760 --> 14:46.280]  for violence against the Tides Foundation that this lunatic was supposedly
[14:46.280 --> 14:56.840]  going to go shoot up Byron Williams and then he kept asking me well you know
[14:56.840 --> 15:01.000]  this guy was a fan of you as well he said and you know do you feel like
[15:01.000 --> 15:05.000]  you're encouraging this and oh your speech might cause problems and I said
[15:05.000 --> 15:10.040]  what's causing problems is this society is unraveling we're becoming a third
[15:10.040 --> 15:18.160]  world joke like Mexico and no one can deny that so you're going to have civil
[15:18.160 --> 15:22.120]  unrest but I'm speaking out against civil unrest because the system is going
[15:22.120 --> 15:26.760]  to use that as a pretext to crack down on everyone and he just didn't want to
[15:26.760 --> 15:30.280]  hear any of it he didn't want to hear any of it and he'd make jokes about world
[15:30.280 --> 15:33.280]  government and I'd say you know they're forming world government would you like
[15:33.280 --> 15:35.960]  me to give you video quotes where they're admitting world government world
[15:35.960 --> 15:42.560]  leaders and it was just all very funny to the guy and it shows the delusional
[15:42.880 --> 15:52.600]  type of world view that these people basically are living in so I will get
[15:52.600 --> 16:00.360]  into that coming up a little bit later in the transmission some of the other
[16:00.360 --> 16:08.880]  news that we're going to be going over deals with obviously the midterm
[16:08.880 --> 16:15.160]  elections that are coming up we're gonna get into this huge stack of key news on
[16:15.160 --> 16:20.720]  the economy I'm tempted to play clips if I have time later of Glenn Beck show
[16:20.720 --> 16:26.000]  yesterday where they were attacking this radio show my website info wars.com I
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.600]  noticed they plug info wars.com but then in the transcript on Glenn Beck.com they
[16:30.600 --> 16:34.320]  removed the reference to info wars.com so that's what they think of their
[16:34.320 --> 16:38.960]  listeners you know excising that out I would imagine Beck getting medical
[16:38.960 --> 16:45.520]  treatment through a hissy fit when he found out that they had done that and it
[16:45.520 --> 16:51.000]  was so amazing to watch the 14-minute clip that is up on info wars.com and
[16:51.000 --> 16:55.280]  prisonplanet.com in our article Beck sidekicks attempt to debunk diet coke
[16:55.280 --> 16:59.960]  controversy because they made it about the left-right paradigm they said yeah
[16:59.960 --> 17:04.000]  these liberals don't like Donald Rumsfeld and they claim that he basically
[17:04.000 --> 17:10.400]  you know sneaks in starting in the 80s and poison Glenn's coke to kill him and
[17:10.400 --> 17:15.040]  isn't that a stupid business plan to want to debilitate and kill your
[17:15.040 --> 17:21.440]  customers you mean like the cigarette makers or the Agent Orange makers or DU
[17:21.440 --> 17:27.040]  maiming and killing our own troops or our own government injecting black people
[17:27.040 --> 17:30.320]  in this country and men women and children in Guatemala and other
[17:30.320 --> 17:34.640]  countries with live syphilis and giving them debilitating disease that ended up
[17:34.640 --> 17:40.520]  killing a bunch of them you mean stuff like that and so they made it all about
[17:40.520 --> 17:44.040]  Rumsfeld's disease because that's what it's been dubbed by many doctors and
[17:44.040 --> 17:49.200]  scientists because they couldn't get it approved twice in the 70s Rumsfeld took
[17:49.200 --> 17:55.480]  over the pharmacological company Searle and he publicly said we'll make this
[17:55.480 --> 18:04.560]  political and he got Ronald Reagan to basically pressure the FDA to get it
[18:04.560 --> 18:09.560]  approved I mean we have the studies where it gave brain tumors and blindness
[18:09.560 --> 18:14.680]  and other serious problems to the Reese's monkeys see I said I get to this
[18:14.680 --> 18:18.080]  later I'm already getting into it and the article they were making fun of that
[18:18.080 --> 18:23.000]  that we had written a warning to Glenn Beck don't drink Diet Coke was to link
[18:23.000 --> 18:33.080]  to Fox News AP Reuters major university studies and they didn't care they just
[18:33.080 --> 18:38.080]  said we were complete lunatics and that the same chemicals that are in Diet Coke
[18:38.080 --> 18:43.000]  and thousands of other products tens of thousands now is what's in orange juice
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.320]  and that's the big lie about the phenylalanine and some of the other chemicals
[18:48.320 --> 18:52.200]  that they talked about being in there aspartame breaks down into a derivative
[18:52.200 --> 18:57.760]  of wood alcohol and formaldehyde and that's why people who were drinking bad
[18:57.760 --> 19:06.880]  gin bad bathtub booze in the great decade of prohibition headed into the
[19:06.880 --> 19:13.000]  Great Depression that's why so many people went blind anybody knows that why
[19:13.000 --> 19:21.080]  knows end up drinking sterno they end up going in to drugstores and buying wood
[19:21.080 --> 19:25.120]  alcohol because it's like 50 cents a bottle and they drink the stuff and they
[19:25.120 --> 19:29.720]  get high as a kite but it also makes them go blind and it's highly addictive
[19:29.720 --> 19:35.480]  you know these guys didn't tell you that aspartame is the secretion that the
[19:35.480 --> 19:41.420]  defecation of the E. Coli bacteria I mean that's a fact all you got to do
[19:41.420 --> 19:46.120]  search the term aspartame manufacturing process but but no it just all became a
[19:46.120 --> 19:50.800]  big joke how we're liberals and if you think aspartame is bad you're a 9-11
[19:50.800 --> 19:57.440]  truther I mean actually use that mind control of saying that it's it's just
[19:57.440 --> 20:00.720]  unspeakable we're just trying to warn people here and we got the facts you've

[24:12.200 --> 24:19.960]  well here is our top story or our top stack of news it's all related to what
[24:19.960 --> 24:25.200]  the word austerity means when we released the Obama deception now more than a
[24:25.200 --> 24:30.480]  year and a half ago the entire two-hour film is about austerity and how it was
[24:30.480 --> 24:35.600]  going to be introduced here and what that word entails total economic
[24:35.600 --> 24:42.240]  implosion and bondage by design we told you they would freeze the bailout not
[24:42.240 --> 24:45.440]  give it to the public we told you they would call for more bailouts of
[24:45.440 --> 24:49.320]  stimulus we told you they would then start taking the pension funds because
[24:49.320 --> 24:54.960]  this very same group of bankers have done this the world over to helpless
[24:54.960 --> 24:59.240]  third-world nations where they've put in paramilitary control systems and that's
[24:59.240 --> 25:05.880]  in the IMF World Bank documents that the BBC got leaked in 2002 such a key group
[25:05.880 --> 25:11.320]  of documents that we were able to get where once the society implodes to a
[25:11.320 --> 25:16.080]  certain level then riots begin and they love that because then they get to come
[25:16.080 --> 25:21.320]  in and crack down even more then that destroys confidence to an even lower
[25:21.320 --> 25:27.720]  level and then that causes stocks to go down the infrastructure to go down the
[25:27.720 --> 25:32.080]  country completely sinks into the financial abyss the bankers then come
[25:32.080 --> 25:36.800]  in flush with all the bailout money and buy up the entire infrastructure so this
[25:36.800 --> 25:42.840]  is the monopoly game this is the financial attack and financial terrorism
[25:42.840 --> 25:49.200]  that we're under now here is an article up at prisonplanet.com government
[25:49.200 --> 25:55.480]  prepares to seize private pensions and I want it we haven't done this in a week
[25:55.480 --> 26:00.240]  I want to do a Google search word today so that people get a full spectrum
[26:00.240 --> 26:05.160]  breakdown from Paul Joseph Watson's article government prepares to seize
[26:05.160 --> 26:12.200]  private pensions so the search term is three words seize private pensions and
[26:12.200 --> 26:16.640]  I called Paul this morning and asked him to add to his article so it's
[26:16.640 --> 26:22.800]  ongoing the fact that this is already happening and so before I go over this
[26:22.800 --> 26:27.720]  article this is how the scam works as I told you five years ago as I told you
[26:27.720 --> 26:32.280]  four years ago as I told you three years ago two years ago one year ago a
[26:32.280 --> 26:38.360]  month ago every week we're here specifically warning you how this is
[26:38.360 --> 26:41.640]  going to work because they've told us how they're going to do it you understand
[26:41.640 --> 26:46.260]  this is not my opinion this is how it's going to be done just like I told you the
[26:46.260 --> 26:50.240]  trilateral Commission said in 75 76 in two different reports they would get the
[26:50.240 --> 26:53.880]  whole world in debt dependent they would sell derivatives about a decade
[26:53.880 --> 26:58.400]  before they pulled the scam the implosion they would use that fiat
[26:58.400 --> 27:03.000]  financial instruments to buy up all the key infrastructure to get countries and
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.640]  individuals in debt they would entice people with cheap mortgages who couldn't
[27:07.640 --> 27:12.960]  pay them off and then they would have a concerted global devaluation of
[27:12.960 --> 27:19.000]  currencies to offset the giant bubble of tens of trillions of debt per nation
[27:19.000 --> 27:26.520]  it's 1500 plus trillion globally impossible to pay off and that they
[27:26.520 --> 27:32.080]  would then say okay the solution is a private global government levying VAT
[27:32.080 --> 27:38.440]  taxes on nations global VAT financial transactions taxes on oil and all
[27:38.440 --> 27:45.800]  carbon-based systems that's now all in the news every day global government
[27:45.800 --> 27:50.000]  being proposed global bank it's the solution to the crisis and the general
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.320]  public isn't informed on these issues so as things get worse and worse they'll
[27:53.320 --> 27:59.160]  you know they're saying okay you set up the world government save me from the
[27:59.160 --> 28:03.480]  bankers when the world government is private and run by the bankers now on
[28:03.480 --> 28:08.120]  the pensions five years ago they changed the federal regulations and laws so that
[28:08.120 --> 28:13.080]  private pensions would have no liability to pay employees who'd sign
[28:13.080 --> 28:16.920]  contracts to be paid those pensions who had had money taken out of their pay
[28:16.920 --> 28:20.680]  checks for those private pensions also money's taken out of your check as you
[28:20.680 --> 28:26.280]  know to put into the social security pension which is gone they've been
[28:26.280 --> 28:30.600]  spending that as the money comes in since social security was set up in the
[28:30.600 --> 28:38.080]  1930s and so they've taken your money pooled it leveraged it to the power of
[28:38.080 --> 28:41.920]  infinity through derivatives it makes fractional reserve banking look tame
[28:41.920 --> 28:48.240]  they've gotten global economic dominance through it and now they're ready for the
[28:48.240 --> 28:53.480]  final masterstroke and we're entering this key phase now on the issue of
[28:53.480 --> 28:59.640]  pensions in the last year and a half this was announced in March by
[28:59.640 --> 29:03.680]  Bloomberg but we'd already seen it happening at the state level through
[29:03.680 --> 29:09.360]  federal initiatives public and private pensions are ordered ordered there's no
[29:09.360 --> 29:12.400]  law but they're just ordered because the government's dictatorial and all these
[29:12.400 --> 29:17.080]  pension fund managers are scared and part of the inside baseball crew and
[29:17.080 --> 29:21.360]  they know follow orders you'll be taken care of you'll get your CEO 20 30 million
[29:21.360 --> 29:26.960]  a year just do what you're told it's like Bernie Madoff was protected for 11
[29:26.960 --> 29:30.960]  years so when we come back I'm gonna explain how all this works and then go
[29:30.960 --> 29:35.760]  through the aftermath of it because Europe is a year to two years ahead of
[29:35.760 --> 29:40.440]  us in this so we're gonna give you a forecast of exactly what to expect in

[33:41.080 --> 33:47.960]  they are going to take the private pension funds by announcing that they
[33:47.960 --> 33:53.880]  are insolvent the same thing with the state and local public pension funds

[34:01.240 --> 34:07.240]  you name it so first what they do is they entice the California pension fund

[34:12.440 --> 34:19.120]  tens of thousands of these to invest in derivatives which they did then the
[34:19.120 --> 34:25.360]  value goes way down in those the banks when it still had the value took the
[34:25.360 --> 34:30.360]  money out for themselves and used it to buy up real assets because again this is
[34:30.360 --> 34:37.560]  basically like a big casino and the insiders always win and in the last
[34:37.560 --> 34:41.160]  year and a half they come out and they order the public and private pension
[34:41.160 --> 34:45.400]  funds the federal government does that's Bloomberg to invest in quote failed
[34:45.400 --> 34:50.440]  banks it's not enough that the pension funds invested in some bad derivatives
[34:50.440 --> 34:55.040]  in some cases and it varies from pension fund to pension fund that's not
[34:55.040 --> 35:01.400]  enough they order them to invest in failed banks then the banks basically take
[35:01.400 --> 35:07.480]  that money use it for bonuses use it to buy up assets and then blow out the
[35:07.480 --> 35:11.360]  failed bank after they've already moved the money out the back door and come
[35:11.360 --> 35:16.760]  back to you and say gee all these state pension funds are going under gee the
[35:16.760 --> 35:21.640]  it's the same thing in Spain and Portugal and Greece and Germany and
[35:21.640 --> 35:28.440]  everywhere gee the pension funds are close to insolvent either they can go
[35:28.440 --> 35:35.360]  belly up or you can take a 30% reduction and we're going to raise the
[35:35.360 --> 35:39.400]  retirement age and we're not going to raise your social security cola which
[35:39.400 --> 35:44.960]  again is the federal public pension fund for everyone supposed to be the
[35:44.960 --> 35:49.920]  supplemental pension and now they've told you that matter of inflation's way up
[35:49.920 --> 35:56.520]  you're not going to get it raised in 2011 probably 2012 in fact now they're
[35:56.520 --> 36:02.120]  talking about even cutting it so they get you dependent on all this then they
[36:02.120 --> 36:06.720]  pull the plug on the financial system everything starts to implode and they
[36:06.720 --> 36:12.160]  come in and say okay the government's got to take over all the pension funds
[36:12.160 --> 36:17.040]  even the solvent ones and put them into a big pool and then we're going to
[36:17.040 --> 36:22.480]  reduce everybody's pension payment we're going to take your 401k one form of
[36:22.480 --> 36:27.080]  pensions your private pension that you administer yourself and we're now going
[36:27.080 --> 36:32.960]  to have the federal government put a tax on it and reduce the payment but at
[36:32.960 --> 36:38.600]  least they saved it at least you're going to get something come on after they
[36:38.600 --> 36:42.480]  move the money out the back door ordered the pensions to invest in failed
[36:42.480 --> 36:49.440]  banks I mean in plain view they have engineered this entire thing and the
[36:49.440 --> 36:55.960]  taxes go up and up and up and up as they cut police as they cut fire as they
[36:55.960 --> 37:01.600]  sell off government buildings as the Greeks sell off more than 600 islands in
[37:01.600 --> 37:07.280]  some cases for billions of dollars apiece and these I've seen London Guardian
[37:07.280 --> 37:14.720]  and BBC articles were private banking heads and brokerage fund heads have so
[37:14.720 --> 37:19.240]  much money they've stolen from Greece that I saw a report where one guy's
[37:19.240 --> 37:25.640]  paying over a billion dollars for a little bitty island that was a national
[37:25.640 --> 37:30.240]  park that tourists paid to go to and so he's going to give Greece back some of
[37:30.240 --> 37:34.680]  their money for the island just so he can vacation there and build a palace on
[37:34.680 --> 37:39.360]  it back so people won't believe it they forget that three months ago search the
[37:39.360 --> 37:43.040]  term Greece selling off islands to pay off debt and then you can read in the
[37:43.040 --> 37:46.680]  articles where they're not just selling them off to the brokerage firms in the
[37:46.680 --> 37:51.200]  banks that came in and took Greece over 10 years ago and they launched this
[37:51.200 --> 37:55.040]  current operation about 11 years ago against the entire planet but the
[37:55.040 --> 38:00.840]  specific bank heads who've made tens of billions individually are coming in and
[38:00.840 --> 38:06.120]  and and like barons actually taking control of the land themselves there it
[38:06.120 --> 38:10.720]  is London Guardian Greece starts putting island land up for sale to save
[38:10.720 --> 38:13.920]  economy and I believe that's the very article where they mentioned the
[38:13.920 --> 38:21.600]  individual billionaires who hold the Greek debt you gotta love that physically
[38:21.600 --> 38:24.640]  getting them when they did it all through complete fraud they're all
[38:24.640 --> 38:34.160]  Bernie made off total can lay type crooks it doesn't matter and these people
[38:34.160 --> 38:39.240]  like George Soros and others literally are financing the media to demonize the
[38:39.240 --> 38:43.160]  First Amendment and try to ban free speech so good people that know the
[38:43.160 --> 38:49.040]  truth about this fraud can be censored and shut up they can't allow us to be on
[38:49.040 --> 38:54.800]  the air exposing what they've done now what you've seen happening all over the
[38:54.800 --> 38:59.200]  world is now coming here as I told you five years ago they're gonna do it to
[38:59.200 --> 39:02.840]  Europe they're gonna do it to the US they're gonna do it to Canada and how
[39:02.840 --> 39:09.280]  did I know they said they were member Greg Palast 2002 on the show with those
[39:09.280 --> 39:16.680]  documents right at the time Joseph Sticklets left the World Bank chief
[39:16.680 --> 39:24.160]  economist now he says he didn't leak them but the point is that thousands of
[39:24.160 --> 39:28.280]  pages of these leaked how they were engineering it and how they were
[39:28.280 --> 39:32.560]  planning it here in America and I've been screaming for eight years made a
[39:32.560 --> 39:39.480]  made a oh my gosh a few years later after 2002 2005 they changed the rules to
[39:39.480 --> 39:46.840]  start taking your private pension funds people call me oh they'll never do that
[39:46.840 --> 39:51.200]  that's a conspiracy theory no it's not it's a fact this is what these criminals
[39:51.200 --> 39:57.360]  do and so then they come in and they give you socialist health care not to give
[39:57.360 --> 40:02.120]  you health care but to say you're going blind you get a cane that's actually in
[40:02.120 --> 40:07.520]  Dashiell's book who wrote the health care bill what does Bill Gates say he
[40:07.520 --> 40:13.840]  says class warfare they don't they get everybody in a collectivist model at the
[40:13.840 --> 40:17.320]  grassroots level the leader up there in the in the vertically integrated conduit
[40:17.320 --> 40:21.000]  getting all the power and money but they convince people that if granny gets
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.520]  health care that's the case for killing granny cover a newsweek then we've got
[40:25.520 --> 40:29.320]  to fire 10 teachers so when teachers start losing their jobs it isn't the
[40:29.320 --> 40:34.520]  banker that did it it's that grandma got health care no the more health care you
[40:34.520 --> 40:40.200]  give grandma the bigger the economy is the more service you demand the better
[40:40.200 --> 40:45.080]  the economy is but they teach you that it's a parasitic cannibalistic economy
[40:45.080 --> 40:48.760]  where we have to feed on ourselves that's what globalism is instead of
[40:48.760 --> 40:55.400]  growing the economy and the unlimited engine of free market wealth the bankers
[40:55.400 --> 41:00.200]  come in create a form of socialism to transfer our wealth to them and then
[41:00.200 --> 41:06.680]  sell us that it's not fascism slash collectivism slash socialism combination
[41:06.680 --> 41:11.640]  that's destroying us they tell you it's the free market when this is not the
[41:11.640 --> 41:16.360]  free market the Federal Reserve private bank consortium getting 28 trillion
[41:16.360 --> 41:20.300]  dollars of US taxpayer money and then keeping it for themselves and telling
[41:20.300 --> 41:23.760]  Congress we won't tell you where the money went that in free market that's
[41:23.760 --> 41:32.960]  bank robbery that's giant mega Godzilla size fraud in your face so brazen so huge
[41:32.960 --> 41:36.800]  the average person can't deal with it so let me get into this and where it's
[41:36.800 --> 41:43.080]  at it they're gonna to put it very simply we're talking to friends and family
[41:43.080 --> 41:46.040]  they've already stolen most the private pension funds they're getting them to
[41:46.040 --> 41:50.720]  invest in derivatives and ordering them to invest in failed banks as they go
[41:50.720 --> 41:55.360]  unsolvent public private state federal you name it people will be told it's all
[41:55.360 --> 42:00.360]  going under the feds have to save it like the quote banks and like GM and
[42:00.360 --> 42:05.760]  Chrysler then that just gives government control over it to vertically integrate
[42:05.760 --> 42:11.800]  all that money and wealth into the top big six banks then they take your pension
[42:11.800 --> 42:17.360]  funds whether it's your private 401k your social security all of it you will
[42:17.360 --> 42:22.560]  have the benefits cut you will have taxes added to it and in some cases they
[42:22.560 --> 42:25.640]  will take more than half is what they're talking about okay and of course
[42:25.640 --> 42:28.640]  that's just round one and then you'll go along with it because at least I got
[42:28.640 --> 42:31.680]  something at least they saved it and then a few years down the road they'll
[42:31.680 --> 42:37.360]  take another half of the half that's left now you got 25% of what you had then
[42:37.360 --> 42:42.040]  you're gonna riot they're gonna gun you down the street and what's left of the
[42:42.040 --> 42:45.240]  middle class will side with the elite and think well at least they're
[42:45.240 --> 42:49.160]  protecting me from those hordes of dangerous people burning down cities
[42:49.160 --> 42:52.640]  it'll be the feds out there with rocketers actually setting the fires
[42:52.640 --> 42:57.600]  I'm has been caught doing that okay government prepares to seize private
[42:57.600 --> 43:01.480]  pensions the government is preparing to seize the private 401k pensions of
[43:01.480 --> 43:06.480]  millions of Americans while enforcing an additional 5% payroll tax as part of a
[43:06.480 --> 43:09.800]  new bailout program that will empower the Social Security Administration to
[43:09.800 --> 43:13.280]  redistribute pension funds in a frightening example a big government
[43:13.280 --> 43:17.440]  on wild and and what does the health care bill do of all the different taxes
[43:17.440 --> 43:21.800]  it has it has a private tax 30 million people that don't want to have to buy
[43:21.800 --> 43:25.400]  overpriced insurance it cuts the quality of the health care you get with
[43:25.400 --> 43:29.120]  austerity with the death panels to ensure the bankers profits that own the
[43:29.120 --> 43:37.080]  insurance companies but it also has a 5% tax in there on all real estate homes
[43:37.080 --> 43:43.080]  you own or homes you rent to people but I digress the government is preparing to
[43:43.080 --> 43:46.640]  seize the private 401k pensions of millions of Americans while in forcing
[43:46.640 --> 43:51.560]  an additional 5% payroll tax as part of the new bailout program that will
[43:51.560 --> 43:54.560]  empower the Social Security Administration to redistribute pension funds
[43:54.560 --> 44:01.200]  in a frightening example a big government gone wild public pension plans
[44:01.200 --> 44:06.160]  have been so aggressively looted already by the government that cities and
[44:06.160 --> 44:14.200]  counties face a 574 billion funding gap according to a CNBC report the and
[44:14.200 --> 44:19.760]  that's just what's currently this month is owed it's in the trillions that
[44:19.760 --> 44:23.920]  black hole is set to be filled by a new proposal that will fairly that's the
[44:23.920 --> 44:28.720]  quote distribute taxpayer-funded pensions to everyone by confiscating the
[44:28.720 --> 44:32.040]  private wealth of millions of Americans its proponents express staggering
[44:32.040 --> 44:35.400]  arrogance and thinking that they can just steal money people have worked for
[44:35.400 --> 44:39.880]  decades to acquire as if it's their own but see how they're gonna do that is
[44:39.880 --> 44:43.760]  when they start imploding the economy faster then the pension funds that are
[44:43.760 --> 44:47.280]  even private the 401ks are gonna go down it's gonna be their argument that
[44:47.280 --> 44:51.440]  they're grabbing the pension funds dumping more taxpayer money into it with
[44:51.440 --> 44:55.760]  the new taxes and so a lot of yuppies after they create a panic and drive down
[44:55.760 --> 45:00.280]  their 401ks then the government will grab it the 401ks will go back up and
[45:00.280 --> 45:04.440]  yuppies will say well I guess it's all right that my taxes and my neighbors
[45:04.440 --> 45:08.920]  taxes went up at least my 401k went up this is how these con artists rope you
[45:08.920 --> 45:12.960]  in but then two years later they'll take even more from you but but you're like
[45:12.960 --> 45:16.880]  an idiot at the casino who's already lost twenty thousand dollars you're
[45:16.880 --> 45:20.840]  writing io used to people you're calling your cousins borrowing money and you
[45:20.840 --> 45:25.240]  just think if I keep playing craps here or if I keep playing roulette you know
[45:25.240 --> 45:33.400]  it's gonna stop them on on red soon I'm gonna win not only with the government
[45:33.400 --> 45:36.840]  confiscate 401k pensions it would also impose a mandatory five percent payroll
[45:36.840 --> 45:40.880]  tax payable to everyone according to a hearing shared last week by senator
[45:40.880 --> 45:45.080]  tom harkin democrat Iowa chairman of the health education labor pension help
[45:45.080 --> 45:50.400]  committee this would of course be a sister government Ponzi scheme working
[45:50.400 --> 45:54.280]  in tandem with social security the primary purpose being to give government
[45:54.280 --> 45:58.920]  politicians additional taxpayer funds to raid to pay for their out of control
[45:58.920 --> 46:07.120]  spending and it goes on and on and I've had Watson add to this how they set the
[46:07.120 --> 46:15.680]  scam up getting them to invest public and private pensions in the derivative
[46:15.680 --> 46:20.820]  backed systems and to get them to invest in fell banks and here was that
[46:20.820 --> 46:26.320]  article March a 2010 Bloomberg failed banks may get pension fund backing as
[46:26.320 --> 46:32.160]  FDIC seeks cash but then you read the article that says they're already
[46:32.160 --> 46:35.960]  ordering him he got a love these articles and it says the federal deposit
[46:35.960 --> 46:41.360]  insurance core is trying to encourage in courage like Don Carlioni putting a
[46:41.360 --> 46:45.240]  gun to your head and saying it's an awful you can't refuse is trying to
[46:45.240 --> 46:50.360]  encourage public retirement funds that can troll more than two trillion to buy
[46:50.360 --> 46:53.880]  all or part of failed lenders oh it and that's a great investment for your
[46:53.880 --> 47:03.040]  pension failed failed derivatives total made up crud backed up with fake
[47:03.040 --> 47:08.160]  mortgages and stolen homes taking a more direct role in propping up the
[47:08.160 --> 47:13.520]  banking system said people brief on the matter and it goes on to talk about the
[47:13.520 --> 47:20.600]  Oregon retirement you name it how they were ordered to an ordered outside of
[47:20.600 --> 47:24.560]  law just you better do it to support of state pension funds to solve the crisis
[47:24.560 --> 47:28.760]  surrounding ongoing bank failures so they're taking private pension funds and
[47:28.760 --> 47:34.600]  investing it in the state employees Oregon pension fund I mean this is just
[47:34.600 --> 47:40.920]  the government raping us at every level and see once they tell the cops and
[47:40.920 --> 47:44.480]  bureaucrats go out there and sees people's kids write tickets take their
[47:44.480 --> 47:47.840]  houses do whatever you have to or you're gonna lose your job in your pension
[47:47.840 --> 47:55.920]  most of them will just walk and load their M16s their AR 15s and they are
[47:55.920 --> 48:00.200]  just gonna march out against us they already are and that's the only place
[48:00.200 --> 48:03.480]  that's hiring is the federal government and the federalized sectors of state
[48:03.480 --> 48:07.880]  government and they are an army of evil individually they may not be evil but
[48:07.880 --> 48:13.480]  the system is evil this is the FDIC shuttered 140 lenders last year and
[48:13.480 --> 48:20.000]  expects to tell me the number to rise in 2010 okay now let's talk about the
[48:20.000 --> 48:23.680]  effect of all of this remember the Google search term is sees private
[48:23.680 --> 48:27.160]  pensions search those three words will educate a lot of people today about
[48:27.160 --> 48:29.960]  what's coming down the pike it's fact it's already here they've already started
[48:29.960 --> 48:33.800]  the controlled implosion so it's a guarantee this is gonna happen in one
[48:33.800 --> 48:37.600]  permutation or another but if people are aware of this politically they won't
[48:37.600 --> 48:41.920]  get away with it because the system is gonna sell the hoax they're going to
[48:41.920 --> 48:46.840]  sell the hoax that this is the only way to save your pension fund that's how
[48:46.840 --> 48:51.120]  they always do it you know give your rights up or Al Qaeda will get you then
[48:51.120 --> 48:54.040]  you learn the whole apparatus of Homeland Securities for the American
[48:54.040 --> 48:58.280]  people or give us more tax money and control your life or the seas will rise
[48:58.280 --> 49:02.760]  and you will die you know global solutions to global problems so they
[49:02.760 --> 49:09.800]  can have a global government now let me just illustrate everything I've been
[49:09.800 --> 49:13.160]  talking about dealing with Europe and the fact that they're a year and a half
[49:13.160 --> 49:16.760]  two years ahead of us so you can see a window into what's happening in live
[49:16.760 --> 49:20.280]  time in the real world and what's going to happen here and already happening to
[49:20.280 --> 49:27.400]  some extent senior citizens brace for social security freeze AP and it says
[49:27.400 --> 49:33.440]  they're going to freeze it just a day ago it was in 2011 now they say they have
[49:33.440 --> 49:39.160]  to wait at least until 2012 probably longer and I'm also seeing reports now
[49:39.160 --> 49:43.240]  they may even cut it so see first they say oh you might not get your social
[49:43.240 --> 49:52.120]  security increase cola for inflation and they're already using it cooked lower
[49:52.120 --> 49:55.560]  inflation numbers so they're already cutting it but but but now they're
[49:55.560 --> 50:02.320]  saying oh two thousand oh 2011 oh 2012 oh 2013 oh we're not just gonna freeze it
[50:02.320 --> 50:08.320]  we're gonna cut it oh it's okay you're an old lady we'll just when you get sick
[50:08.320 --> 50:11.200]  from eating dog food we'll just put you in a hospital and euthanize your honey
[50:11.200 --> 50:16.320]  and we got 10 dumb teachers that have been told when you die they get jobs so
[50:16.320 --> 50:19.600]  they're gonna be more than happy to call for your death granny that will put the
[50:19.600 --> 50:23.200]  headline up there the case for killing granny Newsweek when we come back I'll
[50:23.200 --> 50:31.120]  play a good old Billy Gates little Billy little little little Bobo Gates total
[50:31.120 --> 50:41.080]  slime bag he's heavily invested in health care and we're going to get into

[54:10.200 --> 54:15.960]  what's coming here Greek health system ops for amputation as money-saver and
[54:15.960 --> 54:21.960]  this is out of the Associated Press and also the Daily Caller this Saturday one
[54:21.960 --> 54:26.480]  of Greece's most respected newspapers to Vema reported the nation's largest
[54:26.480 --> 54:30.120]  government health insurance provider would no longer pay for special footwear
[54:30.120 --> 54:35.480]  for diabetic patients amputation is cheaper says the benefits division of
[54:35.480 --> 54:39.480]  the state insurance provider and that's what death care is that's the death
[54:39.480 --> 54:44.160]  panels the new policy was announced in a letter to the Pan Hellenic Federation
[54:44.160 --> 54:47.840]  of the people with diabetes the Federation disputes the science behind
[54:47.840 --> 54:51.920]  the decision of the benefits division see I thought it was doctors who decided
[54:51.920 --> 54:57.880]  what to do no now it's government boards just like here and the death panels are
[54:57.880 --> 55:03.120]  in there Greece's national health care system was created in the 80s during the
[55:03.120 --> 55:09.720]  tenure of Prime Minister Papandreou an academic who won election under the
[55:09.720 --> 55:15.160]  slogan which in Greek is the word for change now let's look at other countries
[55:15.160 --> 55:20.600]  like the United States CNBC US cities face half a trillion dollars of pension
[55:20.600 --> 55:24.160]  deficits that's just what's due this month don't worry the feds are going to
[55:24.160 --> 55:29.040]  take over to fix it and raise taxes continuing here French workers threaten
[55:29.040 --> 55:33.640]  general strike in response to austerity they're having their pensions cut they're
[55:33.640 --> 55:39.400]  having their taxes raised they're being given death panels government run by
[55:39.400 --> 55:44.120]  eugenicists Sarkozy faces showdown over retirement reform oh you're not going to
[55:44.120 --> 55:48.200]  retire when you're 60 you're going to retire when you're 70 so that's just
[55:48.200 --> 55:53.320]  some of what's going on here this is globalism this is the race to the bottom
[55:53.320 --> 55:57.520]  this is the new world order and Bill Gates with Warren Buffett invest their
[55:57.520 --> 56:03.320]  money as philanthropist in tax-free foundations where only the profit goes
[56:03.320 --> 56:07.880]  to quote you in programs and I hear all these weak-minded fools going oh is it
[56:07.880 --> 56:12.840]  Bill Gates so wonderful he cares so much he gave 50 billion and Buffett gave
[56:12.840 --> 56:15.800]  30 billion they got other billionaires in the Chinese government to invest
[56:15.800 --> 56:20.080]  another 20 billion it's over a hundred billion to help children it's all
[56:20.080 --> 56:25.440]  eugenics on record all vaccine programs to sterilize people we've got all the
[56:25.440 --> 56:29.040]  Rockefeller Foundation documents we've shown them on air written countless
[56:29.040 --> 56:33.560]  articles at info wars.com our great researchers one wonderful fellow over
[56:33.560 --> 56:36.680]  the Netherlands just continues to knock it out of the park with his research all
[56:36.680 --> 56:41.880]  of this public and I've got to hear how great Bill Gates is and how much he
[56:41.880 --> 56:46.440]  cares about us as diabetes is up 3,000% people drinking aspartame's one of the
[56:46.440 --> 56:50.440]  biggest causes they're dying and we're not gonna you know tell you to get off
[56:50.440 --> 56:53.480]  the aspartame or sodium fluoride we're not gonna tell you stop drinking corn
[56:53.480 --> 56:58.280]  syrup it's deadly in all the studies no we're just gonna kill your butt we're
[56:58.280 --> 57:01.840]  not gonna give you health care we're gonna chop your arms and legs off we're
[57:01.840 --> 57:06.120]  gonna start with your fingers and your toes and we're not gonna I mean here's
[57:06.120 --> 57:11.880]  Bill Gates and and look if you're above 60 no no eye surgery and they and they
[57:11.880 --> 57:15.400]  play the young people off against the old you don't want to pay for that do
[57:15.400 --> 57:19.000]  you it's a socialist system no I don't don't give those old people eye
[57:19.000 --> 57:24.080]  surgery and then you have a car wreck when you're 25 you're not gonna get the
[57:24.080 --> 57:27.760]  surgery either and it doesn't matter if you have insurance because it's all
[57:27.760 --> 57:31.440]  federally controlled under this system and it all gets put into a big pool the
[57:31.440 --> 57:35.960]  government decides what health care you get here's Billy Gates that goes to
[57:35.960 --> 57:43.960]  health care that over allocated well the US spend 17% of GDP on health care and
[57:43.960 --> 57:50.240]  you drop down to number two which is Switzerland at 12% and so you say well
[57:50.240 --> 57:58.640]  hey what do we get for that well we did we get nothing the health outcomes which
[57:58.640 --> 58:02.480]  are complicated to compare but the health outcomes are basically slightly
[58:02.480 --> 58:09.280]  worse both in terms of averages in the inequity the bottom quartile is very
[58:09.280 --> 58:14.600]  ugly compared to all other rich countries bottom quartile our upper
[58:14.600 --> 58:19.840]  quartile is somewhat better but that's how you get the the inequity so we're
[58:19.840 --> 58:24.800]  spending it a huge rate which if it wasn't increasing faster than inflation
[58:24.800 --> 58:29.240]  it's increasing as a percentage of the economy we're gonna this is a long clip
[58:29.240 --> 58:34.600]  we're gonna come back to the specific clip after break where Gates says you
[58:34.600 --> 58:42.240]  know don't give granny care our 10 teachers will be right back thank you

[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:19.680]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:28.480]  Alex Jones you can go up to prismplana.com and just search the term
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:33.000]  Bill Gates calls for death panels or supports death panels you can get the
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.040]  full video clip but the whole thing is about well higher education is going up
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:42.040]  taxes are going up we've got to basically not give granny treatment so we can
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:45.920]  keep our economy going it's government taking control of health care that's
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:49.600]  screwed it up we have an incredible engine of free market and liberty and
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.640]  that's the globalist problem if they let the true free market take place the
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:57.640]  average person will be so wealthy so independent they won't be able to be
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:01.720]  under government and hence globalist control is the globalist control the
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:06.360]  government and so this is the us against them system that collectivism creates
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:10.840]  let's go ahead and play Gates saying we've had a trade-off in society higher
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:14.320]  education's gone up because of health care costs that's what he was saying
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:20.320]  earlier in the clip here it is a very very high medical costs and a lack of
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:24.360]  willingness to say you know is spending a million dollars on that last three
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:29.920]  months of life for that patient would it be better not to lay off the those 10
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:34.720]  teachers and to make that trade-off in medical cost but that's called the death
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:39.600]  panel and you're not supposed to have that discussion so you of course
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.520]  that's an interesting thing you say there you go would you just and this is
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.240]  everything they promote I mean Bill and Melinda Gates have spent billions of
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:53.560]  dollars trying to get the health care takeover in place and do you hear
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:57.480]  mainline conservatives attacking Bill Gates no I hear him praising him as some
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:02.960]  great guy I mean this guy spent more money than George Soros has trying to
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:08.000]  get the carbon taxes in trying to get the government takeover of health care
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.280]  the big insurance lobbies wrote the legislation put it through but you're
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:16.760]  not supposed to talk about that you're supposed to blame mid-level communist and
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:22.640]  socialist and act like that's where all of this is coming from so if you want to
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:28.280]  understand the death panels look at what's happening you're up wide and how
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:31.280]  they're announcing we're not going to give you any treatment if you're having
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.760]  problems with circulation with diabetes we're going to chop your arms and legs
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:39.200]  off because that's cheaper than giving you any services and then of course that
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:43.280]  causes other debilitating problems now you can exercise you can never reverse
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:52.440]  the trend and you end up dying this is a soft kill form of euthanasia and that's
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:56.600]  what they're doing all the money has to go to the bankers because they created
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:00.960]  the derivative scam everything has to go to the fraudsters and you have to get
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:04.760]  your arms and legs chopped off and Newsweek tells us with an image of a
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:09.880]  plug pulled out of a wall that we need to kill granny and that this is all a
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:13.920]  beautiful wonderful thing and if you ever want your economy back support
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.680]  NAFTA support GAT support manker bailouts support having your pensions
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:23.400]  taken because it's all because of health care cost for grandma from the best
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.440]  health care in the world 50 years ago to some of the worst health care in the
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.960]  world from the highest test scores in the world to what number 43 on the
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:36.760]  planet right now this is globalism this is neo feudalism they want you
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:40.800]  dependent they want you under their control they must wreck society they
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:45.720]  must wreck and suppress technological development because they can't have you
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:53.200]  being independent they have to have you under their control and they think
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:57.760]  there's too many of us and they are selling us on how this is the solution
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:01.400]  how taking your private pension funds is the solution to what the bankers did
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:06.600]  giving them all your money to killing grandma and you notice you know do we
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.480]  spend a million dollars in the last three three months he uses the worst
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:17.240]  case point example and out of this they now have the death panels they now have
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.720]  them in Europe and they're now saying we're not going to give you eye surgeries
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.600]  we're not going to give you cancer surgeries same thing in England we're
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:30.480]  not going to give you basic care so that almost all of your tax money again you
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:35.000]  pay more and more taxes into it goes to the banks and the insurance companies
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.800]  and almost none of it to actual care so we have a nightmare future you think
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:44.400]  things are bad now we haven't seen anything yet we're going to talk to an
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:48.680]  amazing gas part two of going inside one of the top globalist think tanks to
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:52.240]  understand the architecture of the New World Order with Alex Abaya straight
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:55.920]  ahead after this break will also open the phones up later in the hour for Alex
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:02.640]  Abaya stay with us this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:07.080]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:11.120]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:15.000]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.560]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:27.560]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:31.360]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:35.040]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:39.360]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:42.520]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.240]  finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:16.400]  Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:21.520]  Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:26.560]  us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:31.360]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:36.080]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:40.000]  and arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.840]  do we make the checkout to. Today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:49.840]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of fall of the
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:55.840]  Republic on DVD at info wars.com or watch it online right now in super high

[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:36.800]  of our in-depth interview live dealing with probably the most powerful and
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:41.040]  important globalist think tank setting up world government the only person to
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:46.520]  ever be given massive access to their archives and he was not expecting what
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:52.960]  he found new york times best-selling author researcher he's also of course an

[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:03.600]  talking to him but before i go any further i'm going to be out in california
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:09.440]  late next week watson's going to be sitting in just on the friday show
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:14.320]  and the monday show because i am going to
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:18.000]  be out in california part of an investigation while i'm there
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  i am going to be speaking at two k s c o
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.840]  and the website's k s c o dot com events
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:34.880]  10 80 a.m the great folks out there the owner of the two stations that carry us
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.600]  there and it goes into san francisco hundreds of thousands of listeners
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:41.200]  conservatively every day mz the owner has been
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:46.800]  begging me really in a nice way for a year and a half to come out there and
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:50.640]  speak and i said okay i'll come speak and they
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.200]  only have 800 seats at the coconut grove theater on the sunday

[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.000]  and so i haven't really plugged this yet it's probably going to sell out
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.360]  so if you want the tickets go to k s c o dot com
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.720]  i'm going to be doing my show actually live monday from their studios so i
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.480]  guess watson won't be filling in on monday
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:14.400]  or i may have him there in the wings his backup uh but i'm going to be speaking
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:17.440]  on sunday and monday if you want to go to the monday event
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:22.320]  they've already sold 200 of the 800 tickets so you need to go to k s c o
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.560]  dot com if you want to see the two hour speech
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:28.000]  and question and answer i'm going to do it's 10 dollars and 80 cents for the
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.800]  radio station of course uh after after its frequency 10 80 a.m

[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:56.160]  thursday morning at 11 a.m central when we kick off the live transmission
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:00.400]  it was a listener who started the first info wars dot com
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.920]  money bomb three years ago it was done in the early
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.040]  summer we did it again last year in the early summer i wasn't going to do one
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:10.240]  this year we have tripled our audience
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:13.920]  according to google analytics the stations that get arbitron
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:19.280]  same numbers there uh alexa and and all the statistics out there we've
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.160]  tripled the audience but because we're in a depression
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:25.520]  funding has not just stayed the same it's gone down
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.960]  and our bandwidth bill is over 20 000 a month i have
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:33.520]  right at 20 employees and contractors we have a 14 000 square foot facility we
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:36.560]  just built the shell of the new studio i need to hire
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.840]  the personnel for it i need to get the cameras the switchers the equipment
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:43.040]  i just paid for the 14 000 for the lighting system it sounds like a lot
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:46.320]  that's cheap so we're doing it you know prosumer level
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.680]  i'll launch the daily news television show and then a once a week show that
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.880]  i'm gonna try to get on television we could buy the time on dish or
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.680]  something like that but uh some may want to actually just pick it up we've
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:59.120]  already had offers in europe so but we're doing this ourselves we're not
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:02.160]  backed by news core it was more news today about billions of
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:06.400]  dollars spent with mbc fox uh in secret government funding for
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:10.160]  what's in the shows not just the ads what they call behavior placement
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:14.160]  what i coined 10 years ago as propaganda placement
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.920]  they've just now admitted that what last year they call it behavior placement
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:21.760]  that was their secret term my term was propaganda placement i think even
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.280]  better we don't have that funding we have you supporting us and
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.080]  if you believe in what we're doing and you understand we're going into a
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:31.840]  global depression the world government is here we're in a major crisis
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.920]  and you want to see the tip of the spear super charged and sharpened
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:41.280]  it is up to you to donate on the info wars moneybomb.com site
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:45.280]  kicking off we've already raised over 50 000 but i want to raise 500 000
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.640]  and so we'll need to raise 400 plus thousand dollars in that 24 hour live
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.520]  period we're going to have live interviews with amazing guest phone
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:54.560]  calls also a bunch of never before seen video interviews
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:58.960]  i've done over 40 interviews on video with lord montan i mean the list goes on
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:01.600]  and on this is the best interview i've ever seen with him by the way that we're
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:05.840]  going to just premiere here for the viewers and we've been testing it
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:11.280]  in the last few days we put up a free version of
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:15.440]  prisonplanet.tv stream yesterday in the last hour
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:19.840]  and thousands of people logged in to the free live stream you know we have free
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:22.960]  audio streams on the website that costs us around 8 000
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:25.920]  dollars a month just to serve because it's hundreds of thousands a day that
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:29.920]  tune into it just having one hour of the video on the
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:33.280]  show free costs about a hundred and fifty dollars in bandwidth and we've
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:36.320]  got bulk cheap i mean cheap bandwidth today we're
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.960]  doing the whole show free what prisonplanet.tv
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:42.880]  subscribers see just to test it out for the 24 hour transmission
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.960]  where we're going to try to have it free unless the servers crash
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.600]  for everybody but we estimate it's going to probably cost
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:53.040]  five thousand dollars just to stream free
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:57.200]  to the hundreds of thousands of people that will watch the video stream
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:00.400]  coming up thursday in fact we've done calculations it could cost as much as
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:03.440]  20 000 uh i mean i mean that's an example of
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:09.120]  how the meter is running here i mean glenn beck
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:13.120]  info wars.com prisonplanet.com are bigger than all his sites combined
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:17.200]  bigger than rush limbaugh site bigger than shan hanity bigger than media matters
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:22.320]  info wars.com is now bigger than msnbc.com in all the rating services
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:26.160]  but their website makes tens of millions of dollars a year my websites you know
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.520]  doing everything we can a few million and that goes into funding things
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:33.440]  this is very expensive folks we're talking about tens of thousands of
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:39.840]  dollars just to give you a free video feed for 24 hours
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:43.920]  okay that's what we're talking about here and you know we've tried just in
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:47.440]  tv and other things to give it away free they still can't handle it
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:52.640]  we we've sent them feeds before and when 20 000 people log on it crashes
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.000]  you understand there's nothing as big as this show on the internet
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.920]  so that's our and i'm sorry alexa bay i just my cruise keeps pointing out i'm
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:03.520]  not plugging the money bomb coming up uh but uh
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:08.800]  he's waiting in the wings the issue is i shouldn't have to spend all my time
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.120]  in this war trying to grub up the money to put in the gas tank of this
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:16.240]  abram's tank running over the enemy forces in the info war
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:20.240]  i need your support by the books by the videos by the t-shirts get the
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.520]  materials get them out to people donate at the money bomb support our
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:26.560]  sponsors that's how we're doing this
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.840]  i guess i could be smart like glenn beckon you know sell out thousand two
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.080]  thousand person theaters and charge a hundred bucks
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:36.240]  and then i guess i would have the money but i just have this instinct to just
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:39.760]  try to pay for the venue you know ten dollars eighty cents
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:44.480]  i here's my last point of the top five or six
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.280]  most viral films in history we got three or four of them i mean it's
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:50.240]  conservative to say the obama deception has been seen by over 30 million people
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:54.480]  for free online it has caused a major political sea change just that one film
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:58.000]  thanks to you getting it out to everybody i make a film cost a 125
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.280]  thousand dollars and i give it away people say well then
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:04.800]  we don't want to donate you should charge for that the point is most people
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:08.480]  won't pay it's you that cares to support what we're doing
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.320]  where can you find an organization or an operation having a bigger effect
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:15.760]  i challenge you who was under more attack from the adl
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:20.480]  southern prairie law center george soros media matters msnbc nightline hit
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:24.800]  pieces cnn hit pieces

[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.680]  they've had army intelligence surveilling us that came out in the news
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:35.520]  folks the system is scared of us they can't kill me
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:39.600]  cross my fingers because it'll only make all my information that much more
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.960]  powerful but they are trying to destroy us so
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:47.040]  we need the war chest 500 000 is nothing
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.920]  what we could do with five million is unbelievable
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:54.560]  it's nothing in this deflated dollar in this economy
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:57.360]  okay i'm going to shut up and i apologize to alexa baffer doing that five
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:00.240]  minute rant while he's holding it with his 30 minutes into the next hour

[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.760]  as for me i'm just trying my best you know to tell people you know what the
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:32.480]  story's all about what how our society has changed you know we've gone from
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:36.080]  being citizens with rights and responsibilities to being consumers with
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:40.000]  budgets and choices it's you know to me there's something wrong with that
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.400]  it doesn't make so um i wrote this book named uh called that soldiers of reason
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:48.240]  the rand corporation corporation and the rights of the american empire
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:52.960]  and i was granted uh as far as i know is the only journalist ever granted access
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:57.280]  untrammeled access to the files of of the rand corporation
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:00.880]  to study them and to see what their effect was on american society in the
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:04.480]  world at large in the book have a line that says
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:08.000]  you know we are really the bastard children of brown and we don't even know
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.680]  it uh because they have affected us in so many ways
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:15.200]  starting in 1948 when they became incorporated that is just
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:20.480]  truly amazing and they continue doing so um uh how did i come about this well
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:25.120]  because before that i had written a book uh called shadow enemies
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:30.400]  about a sacred terrorist plot that had been concocted by adults hitler
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:36.080]  uh on december 8th 1941 immediately after pearl harbor he sent two u-boats
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:41.600]  with nazis out here german americans uh to come out here and to start a
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:45.280]  waiver tour uh to you know plant bombs into his own

[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.520]  they've charted our history in the last 50 years

[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:51.520]  go ahead you've got the floor break it down sure no problem well as i was
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:55.440]  saying before i mean i've done this this book on nazi terrorists coming here to
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:59.200]  the u.s and while i was signing away one of
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:02.560]  those books i met somebody who was at the ran corporation
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:06.800]  and i suggested that you know it the idea came to me that maybe
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:09.440]  you know i should do something about this because i first heard of them
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:12.960]  back in the 1960s when i was in college and i thought well you know what's
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:17.280]  going on with these people etc and you know long behold to my surprise once
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:22.160]  i started going into their archives i realized my god these people have done
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:25.920]  absolutely everything i mean they've changed it you know they they were the
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:29.920]  ones who actually set up the whole nuclear strategy for the united states
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:34.880]  starting in the night in late 1940s they were influential
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.880]  in getting kfk elected they were the ones who came up with the whole concept
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:43.360]  of the missile gap meaning that you know there was a
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:46.560]  missile gap between the u.s and the soviet union where the soviet union had more
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:50.560]  missiles than the united states they were involved from in the rise of the
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:54.240]  military industrial complex right from the very beginning
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:58.800]  they were also instrumental in stopping the taunt in the 1970s
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:02.720]  and but even more important than all that is they came up with this whole
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:06.160]  theory called rational choice theory which is what i was you know talking
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:11.920]  about before that they they transformed our concept
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:18.480]  of country and our duty to one of being consumers so you know we're no
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:21.840]  longer patriots we're just people who go out and buy and spend i mean it's like
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:26.000]  you know during the uh right after 9 11 when bush said you know you don't have to
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.800]  do everything just go out there and do your duty and watch your duty go out
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:31.360]  there and spend you go out there to the mall
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.360]  and i'm thinking even then i was thinking you know it just makes no sense
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:40.240]  how could it be how could we as citizens be expected only to be consumers
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:44.640]  and it's a debt system designed to create a debt black hole that can't be paid
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:47.440]  back that's the that's the financial servitude go ahead
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:52.240]  yes exactly and not only that it's then have the country and the whole world
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:58.000]  you know ruled by a an unelected technocracy i mean you know if you do it
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.040]  there's so much to talk about it's all it's all in the book but if you really
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:05.440]  start looking at this is that you see that from the very beginning
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:09.840]  that the people around and and and they're a main affiliate which is the
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.400]  Ford Foundation they have seen themselves as people who are above the
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:17.600]  fray who are intellectuals who have the rule of
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:21.040]  reason and nobody else does and that they can write
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:24.160]  things and they can do things the way they should be
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:27.760]  and they're not accountable to anyone who is not realizing or perhaps
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:30.400]  realizing it but you know not telling anyone that they're really accountable
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:34.080]  to a small group of financiers who are actually backing them all the time
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:37.680]  but that was the original intent to rent and you know it just continues to this
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:40.000]  very day
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:45.040]  we're about to go to break but go over mid-air fueling
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:49.680]  continuity of government i mean last year they put out a report about how
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:52.160]  they were going to federalize all the local police
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:55.600]  and have a private paramilitary groups ruling every community
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:59.840]  i mean everything we see i remember in 99 seeing rand corporation in the austin
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:02.880]  american statesman saying there's going to be big terror attacks
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.760]  we're going to take your rights we're going to set up a thing called homeland
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:09.440]  security i mean they really are writing the book on almost everything
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:12.960]  exactly exactly because you know they always have all these contingency plans
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:15.440]  and in a way it's like they're always tipping their hand
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:19.040]  and it's like the latest thing that they're into right now is proposition 19
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.520]  which i don't know if you're aware of it here in california
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:24.560]  you know uh it's just you know that they seem to be almost advocating
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:29.680]  legalizing pot uh so as to again turn consumers i mean turn people into
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:32.720]  mindless consumers it's really it's really amazing
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:38.560]  now as regards the in-flight fueling well what happened is that they needed a
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:42.480]  way to be able to refuel the planes that would be
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:46.000]  carrying atomic bombs to the so that to so
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.600]  reunion in case there was a war between united states and the soviet
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:56.400]  back in the 50s and 60s because people had ran that come up with a plan
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:00.880]  called the basing study that basically um
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:05.680]  highlighted certain deficiencies in the national security apparatus
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:08.960]  of the time and that we had all our bombers all planted in different
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:12.160]  locations and they were really susceptible to bombing
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:17.280]  by soviet forces so after the basing study then all those bombers were brought
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:20.960]  back home to the u.s so in order then to be able to
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:25.360]  get them to uh make the full flight all the way to the soviet union then
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:29.680]  the rand corporation came up with a concept of you know in-flight fueling
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:31.760]  they'll figure them up with the whole concept of you know second strike
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.400]  capability and you have people like harry mason came
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:37.360]  coming out of rand yeah let's talk about the masters of the rand
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:41.520]  corporation and just the entire spectrum and of
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:44.160]  course their headquarters there in california
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:48.240]  has a giant mushroom cloud sculpture man of chain link
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:52.160]  we'll talk about that as well we're on the march
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:30:00.960]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:04.000]  hello this is alex jones with some important questions

[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:19.360]  well i've got a lot of questions for alex abeya award-winning journalist

[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:29.440]  but alex you were you were getting into
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:32.720]  the hundreds of inventions the hundreds of developments
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:36.160]  how our society operates the insurance deductible
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:39.440]  how they talked about how to psychologically manipulate people
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:43.120]  i mean it's it's thousands of things that the rand corporation
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:46.080]  again like like like you mentioned before the whole question of medical
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:49.360]  deductibles comes out with something called the rand study
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:53.040]  the rand medical study in which basically they were the underwriters
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:57.040]  of medical insurance for more than 10 000 people in the united states
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:01.520]  for a period of over five years uh because this has happened during the
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:05.680]  niction administration and the government just wanted to see well
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:10.240]  how little will people put up with it basically uh and they find out too much
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:13.360]  to their surprise maybe not to their surprise people
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:16.400]  really didn't seem to mind all that much if they had to pay a little bit in order
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:20.720]  to get medical coverage so that's what they did so because before that
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:24.160]  medical coverage had been seen as essential you know and companies that
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:27.840]  offered it uh as far as to be able to um be a
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:32.320]  counterpart to the soviet system uh and therefore we would take care of our own
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.640]  people uh there's something that was negotiated as
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:38.240]  well uh by the labor unions and the late 40s and
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:41.600]  early 50s but by the late 60s early 70s you know
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:44.720]  that the government felt we were spending too much money on the health of
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:48.080]  other people so therefore they started saying well how can we get this money
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:52.080]  back so due to this particular medical study uh
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:55.680]  they came up with a concept of you know deductible so you know at the beginning
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:59.200]  it was only you know a few cents and a few dollars and now you all know how
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:02.880]  much that that is you know it's a big chunk and it's growing
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:07.200]  growing every day uh so that's only one of their many contributions
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:11.600]  um to uh to the civilization uh we also have the concept you know
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:15.600]  of charging for everything that everything has a price because it all stems
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:22.480]  again from their concept of people not so much as citizens but but as consumers
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:26.400]  which again is the concept that came about because of the conflict that
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:30.800]  existed between the soviet union and the united states uh they wanted to get away
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:35.040]  you know from that old marxist thing of you know having uh you know
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:38.720]  saying that it will let me see if i recall correctly which would be
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:43.200]  from each according to um or is it from each according to his ability to each
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:45.760]  according to his needs and the way that they
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:49.440]  thought that was by uh making people then consumers which is you know
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:52.160]  whatever it is that you want that's what you should get because after all
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:56.000]  there's no such thing as a rational collective decision
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.080]  that all collective decisions are irrational and tyrannical
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:03.200]  um so they came up with this whole concoction and you know we're living in
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:07.440]  the world right now but then you notice that actually
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:12.000]  the ultra rich corporations are actually the ford foundation itself
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.520]  promotes a form of collectivism to trick us
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:19.760]  and then it transfers the wealth to the elite but then they sell it as if
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:25.440]  it's it's it's a anti socialist or communist movement but the rand
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:29.760]  corporation's been the biggest promoter of the largest sector of corporate
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:33.680]  welfare the military industrial complex absolutely absolutely i mean they were
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:39.600]  right there present at the creation like that uh like Dolan said you know
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:42.800]  they were right there right from the beginning like the people in ran
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:46.720]  with the whole study there was something called the gator report that came out in
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:50.720]  the late 1950s uh in which it advocated increasing
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:55.040]  military spending in the united states uh and that was made up you know of
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:58.560]  randomizers and people from the military who
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:02.000]  obviously stood to profit if all of a sudden the pentagon budget would go up
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.440]  president i think i refuse to do that because he was a general who had seen
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:08.080]  what war is all about most of these people have never been through that
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:11.840]  count that kind of thing and he said no i'm not gonna do that i'm gonna try to
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:15.920]  bring down the budget and give give money back to the people in united states
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:21.040]  instead what these guys did is that they sabotage the candidacy of the
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:24.960]  republican candidate who was nixon and you know they brought up
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:28.640]  kennedy who in in essence was a creature of the military industrial complex
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:31.600]  that's what we got involved in vietnam that's what we got involved in all these
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:34.480]  different places and of course ran was always there
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:38.000]  i mean ran at one point was advocating that uh
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.840]  united states should give money to the military
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:45.520]  in third world countries because the military then would be able to guide
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:49.280]  their people to the 20th century and bring them out of
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:54.320]  out of you know out of their ignorance now that's their public cover story
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:59.680]  but if you look at the cia and rand they prefer military dictatorships to
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:03.440]  freedom in countries because it allows the mega corporations to interface
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:08.080]  with a small ruling class and not have to deal uh with a society where people
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:11.440]  are allowed to elect to elect the representatives but
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:14.560]  let's briefly look at kennedy did you run into anything on him in their
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:18.560]  archives because we know at first he doubled defense spending he was you
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:21.760]  know pro-war then he became anti-vietnam war
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:25.760]  anti-fellow reserve they brought him operation north woods
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:32.640]  the plan is to stage 911 style attacks and he said no and then he was clearly
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:36.400]  killed by this very same uh you know overall system so
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:40.800]  what happened with kennedy well with kennedy it's a very interesting dichotomy
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:44.160]  because what you have is at the beginning yes he's very much a creature
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:47.520]  of that particular establishment but then he starts moving away as you yourself
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:52.080]  say north woods though was provoked by the whole question of cuba as you know
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:56.400]  he screwed up in the Bay of Pigs we're not with the eating gift you know from
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:01.680]  air cover to the cubans who had landed there so that became like a real irritant
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:04.560]  and then the united states was preparing for another
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:09.200]  invasion of cuba and among those things that they were advocating was north woods
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:14.720]  which is you know staging uh supposed attacks by cuban forces so then they
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:19.200]  would give them an excuse to go in and invade and uh but the problem was that
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:22.480]  you know right around that time castor was also getting all his money
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:26.320]  and his armaments from the soviet union and obviously his missiles
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:30.720]  and then the missiles crisis erupted and after that you know the united states
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:34.480]  tried to deal with the soviet union and said they will no longer invade cuba
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:37.840]  so meantime though kennedy was trying to set up
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:43.280]  um the uh backing of cuban exiles uh when it comes to
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:47.040]  actually attacking cuba and having that gorilla warfare over there
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:51.600]  and uh because of this experience with the cia and with the pentagon over the
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:55.360]  bay of pigs and over the mid uh you know the missile crisis because
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:00.640]  after all the pentagon wanted him to go in and invade and nowadays we know that
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:04.880]  had had he does so they would have been a total disaster because
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:08.480]  you know they had nuclear weapons that were you know were there and they were
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:12.240]  they were about to be sent you know directly to united states we would not
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:15.600]  have been able to go in and and and take out all those missiles
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:19.360]  because they were they were operative already um because of that kennedy
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:23.680]  started you know pulling away from the cia and from the directors of the
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:27.440]  military industrial complex and you know the question is yet to be resolved
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:31.040]  where they were actually was murdered because of this he had grave doubts
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:33.680]  about vietnam because of what happened at bay of pigs
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:37.120]  and he thought that you know liberation movements uh you know really
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:41.120]  cannot be dealt with in that way in fact the day that he was killed
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:44.640]  his representative richard goodwin was meeting with che Guevara down in south
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:47.920]  america to see that they could cut some kind of deal
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:51.600]  so uh yeah obviously there were a lot of people who were after his scalp and you
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:56.400]  know fortunately he died for that um you know and that the people who were
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:00.480]  trying to set up this whole technocracy which is not what i referred to in my
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:04.560]  book all the time which is yeah but small group of people who feel
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:08.080]  that you know they could they should rule the world and you know they should
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:13.040]  line their pockets while doing so uh going back all the way to 1940s about
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:16.720]  when you know the ford foundation and ran were set up
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:21.280]  there was a guy named um norman dodd who at one point interviewed
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:25.680]  uh you know uh gator who was uh rowan gator who was one of the founders of
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:31.120]  ramp and he claimed that when he talked to gator gator told him that their plan
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:34.880]  gator at the time was the president of the ford foundation the plan was to and
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:38.880]  i quote to so alter life for the united states that we can be
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:42.960]  comfortably merged with the soviet union obviously that didn't happen but
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:46.400]  what did happen is something even better for the people who hold the range of
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:49.280]  power which is no they destroyed this over
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:52.320]  union and now you have technocrats over there you have technocrats over here
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:55.600]  and it's a small group of people they're ruling the world and that's where we're
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:59.760]  at all right let me stop you because this is the key on the surface they say
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:03.040]  they're fighting communism and collectivism but really they're creating
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:08.320]  a corporate vertical integration system and you're the only person to ever be
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:11.120]  allowed in to their files it's in your book
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:14.960]  it's on record we have the ford foundation documents that a mirror
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:20.640]  what rand uh was up to go over specifically the type of
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:24.400]  technocracy they talked about same thing as the big brzezinski wrote about
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:28.720]  in between two ages then get into the world
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:31.040]  government because you talked about you never believed in that you thought it
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:35.280]  was a conspiracy theory there you were in their own archives right seeing all
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:38.560]  of this and the type of world government they wanted to build
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:41.200]  well it's been there right from the beginning i mean another one of the
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:44.640]  you know the major figures in rand john williams who was a mathematician
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:47.680]  who's like i think the third or fourth higher in rand
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:51.600]  you know he said we should go in and nuke the soviets right now and take over
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:54.880]  and have the world government the united states then merge into a world
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:57.760]  government that will be controlled by the u.s but the entire world will be under
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:01.760]  this government and you know time and again there have been people at rand
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:05.200]  and affiliated with rand we've come up we've come up with this idea
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:09.040]  the problem is that that idea has been discredited
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:12.640]  in public but yet it's you know there's a lot of people who still
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:16.160]  believe in that because again they believe in what they call
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:19.120]  you know the use of reason and that you know there's a small group of people
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:23.040]  who will tell everybody else what to do because they know better
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:26.640]  and thus you know they don't we don't need elections we don't need not the voice
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:29.600]  of the people we don't need anything like that because these guys
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:33.680]  if they're scientists or so they claim they know what's best
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:37.520]  and therefore they i mean even today if you go to rand corporation you say you
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:40.720]  have a problem and you you know give them a question they say well
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:43.920]  that may not be the question that you should be asking actually this is the
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:46.880]  question that you should be asking so they turn it around
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:50.720]  so it's it has not changed at all on the surface it seems to
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:54.240]  but underneath you still have these same drives for
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:58.240]  a small group of technocrats to be ruling the world
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:01.760]  and you know it obviously you know they went hand in hand with
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:05.600]  the Ford Foundation the Ford Foundation used to go around you know
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:11.360]  giving front giving cover to CIA operations throughout the world
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:13.840]  and you know they even set up something called i know if you're aware of this
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:17.200]  something called area five of the Ford Foundation
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:21.280]  which is dealt with behavioral sciences in the 1950s
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:25.120]  uh you know and what they would try to do basically is
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:28.720]  you know again changed the way that people think
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:32.160]  and intervene in foreign governments and you know they provided cover for you
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:34.800]  know the coups that happened in Burma at the time
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:40.080]  the Philippines Peru Iran even Italy i mean these are things that have happened
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:43.680]  and they continue to happen to this very day
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:47.520]  now this is so important let's talk about area five let's talk about
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:51.280]  the type of world government they wanted to build it has been discredited
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:54.480]  because patriots have been fighting it for more than 60 years
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:58.480]  but now we do have a corporate global governance
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:02.240]  run by the banks right who bankrupted our society by design
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:05.680]  and are now offering a global government run by them
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:10.080]  through the financial system to save us from the financial crisis they created
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:13.040]  and it's the same thing with the pension funds again because it's a kind of
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:16.080]  spurious freedom what they offer us i mean that's what i was referring to at the
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:19.520]  beginning of our conversation in that you know they say that we're consumers
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:22.480]  but i mean look there's nothing wrong with buying things that you like but
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:26.080]  enjoying life but when that is the end of all of your life when the way to the
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:28.400]  government sees he was just a mindless sucker
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:32.560]  he's going to go out and buy the latest model of whatever it is
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:36.640]  so you know the cheapest teachers from china we have a problem
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:43.520]  because we're not being taken as citizens i mean what they're doing is
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:46.560]  and and this goes back to edward bernay's before the ram corporation
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:50.640]  right is they take away things like family
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:54.720]  property local control they make you not value that
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:46:00.480]  so you sell your soul for some wampum kind of like the new york indians
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:04.480]  300 years ago selling new york and long island
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:09.520]  for one bucket of glass beads you know that basically cost one silver dollar
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:12.400]  at the time and so it's we'll give you
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:17.040]  iphone's we'll give you nfl we'll give you ut football we'll make
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:20.640]  those people we'll make michael jordan the hero
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:25.520]  not muhammad ghandi right not jesus and you know not martin luther king right
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:30.320]  not george washington we will you know turn you into creatures
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:34.960]  who are basically me me me me me so everybody's me me me me me
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:38.240]  and then nobody will stand up for anybody else because we've been
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:44.000]  psychologically and culturally atomized exactly that's exactly and that is the
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.560]  main sin of the ram corporation they
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:50.640]  institute this kind of thinking into the world they systematized it formalized
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:54.160]  it and thus gave us the foundation for this incredible
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:57.520]  transformation in the entire world that's why i say that we're all
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:02.160]  rants bastard children because it it started in the late 1970s and
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:06.160]  early 80s but especially under reagan who was again another
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:10.400]  creature of the military industrial complex who came in and said well in the
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:13.360]  realm of freedom we're going to deregulate everything because everything
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:16.720]  is better if it's deregulated which means basically it's like hey
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:19.200]  the corporations can do whatever they want because there's no restraints on
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:22.560]  them and you know we all saw what happened
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:25.680]  we all saw what happened with you know when they repealed the glass teagle act
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:28.960]  you know all these millions of foreclosures that we're going through
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:33.280]  the whole financial collapse because it's not free market it allows them who
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:37.520]  control the government rules to selectively steal and thieve
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:41.040]  now they've got us communalized right now they've got us in a
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:45.600]  consumer collectivism so they say if you don't want the system to die
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:49.360]  that you're now basically a sigmes twin of connected to
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:53.600]  you've got to give in to our next phase absolutely i completely agree
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:58.160]  and this is all done deliberately you know i mean
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:01.840]  people have to be aware of this so then they will be able to put an end to this
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:06.160]  to begin to try to put an end to this because i think it can still be stopped
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:10.000]  i mean you know i i i don't think that apocalypse is around the corner
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.400]  although we're creeping closer every day
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:15.840]  but i think we can still stop it but people first have to be informed
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:18.960]  and that's one of the things that i try to you know that i try to point out in
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:21.440]  my book
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:25.680]  continue and basically you know i mean that's
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:29.840]  that's where we are right now i mean it they continue doing this kind of thing
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:32.720]  they they keep on feeding us it's like bread and
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:36.720]  circuses remember you know the roman times you know it's like we're gonna
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:39.520]  have all these things i mean you're gonna have all these sweet little
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:43.200]  products and the meantime don't think too much about who
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:46.160]  is going to go into office whether there's really any difference between
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:50.320]  the democratic and the republican party whether even if you have a little
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:53.680]  group of people who finally think oh maybe we should do something about this
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:57.600]  but then begin to be co-opted immediately by larger forces behind them
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:01.600]  such as the p-party i mean it's it's all for peace
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:05.680]  and you know we have to stand up for our rights we can't tell people no
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:08.480]  this cannot be
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:11.520]  you're absolutely right
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:16.160]  overall did you get into any of the newer ran corporation documents because
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:20.800]  they're charting the police state takeover the naked body
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:25.120]  scanners the federalization of local police they admit they're charting
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:28.480]  this nightmare system long before the terror attacks came
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:32.640]  they said we're putting this in place the terror attacks are coming
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:36.240]  because another arm of the system staged the attacks of course they knew it
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:39.280]  and we're going to take control of society this way
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:42.960]  and in the next phase and they're already doing it with most of the
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:46.640]  uh you know tuitions being paid for the scholarships
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:52.240]  are now about data mining spying prison guards surveillance
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:56.240]  they are shifting the economy over to one purely run by the military
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:00.880]  industrial complex where you can't get a job unless it's working for them
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:03.680]  that's right that's right or unless you pass through clearance
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:07.680]  i mean it's it's absurd it's totally absurd and one of the things that really
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:10.960]  bugs you about this company is like for instance you know it's like
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:14.240]  even when you're applying for a job people want to see your credit record
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:18.000]  and i go well what does that have anything to do what does that have to do
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.480]  with the fact of whether you can see your job
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:24.800]  whether you can you know whether you qualify for this note they want to see
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:28.320]  whether you're a true consumer and whether you have paid your debts
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:31.520]  in other words again you're being viewed just as a consumer instead of a
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:35.200]  professional or or a citizen and that's the kind of thing that i think is
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:37.760]  intolerable
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:43.440]  amazing alex stay there we're going to come back
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:48.560]  and continue with your book the research more on world government

[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:47.280]  i want to condense this down okay i've read the propaganda that's the name of
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:49.600]  the book by ever bernay's i've read his other writings
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:53.280]  i've read british ministry of defense reports i've read the released and
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:59.280]  declassified uh information out of british
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:04.400]  think tanks uh that have developed very similar situations and it was brought
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:08.800]  to a high science by the 60s they had these systems back in the 30s
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:12.640]  and they weaponized culture with sex and glitz
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:15.440]  you know i don't defend a lot of the oppressive things going on in some
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:19.360]  muslim nations but they can recognize this is an alien
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:23.440]  weaponized culture meant to get our children our women
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:26.880]  break up our families to make us more easily controlled and that's why they're
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:30.560]  the big enemy of the globalist because they're not you know they're a billion
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:34.400]  one hundred million people and that most of them aren't going along with it now
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:39.680]  if you go back to joseph mccarthy he was a good guy he meant well
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:44.160]  he had some problems nobody's perfect he was worried about communist infiltration
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:46.960]  he knew about stalling killing millions and millions of people
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:52.320]  in ukraine alone and the media used him to set up hysteria to get the ran
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:56.080]  corporation and the pentagon more power but it's been declassified the whole
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:59.280]  time they've been funding the soviets from before world war two
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:02.800]  they've been funding them and the british have been funding them
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:06.560]  in 1917 it's also been declassified that mal was put into power
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:10.160]  by the cia david rockefeller in 1973 wrote about it in the new york times and
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:12.560]  said how great mal satong was i read those quotes
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:17.280]  last week it's in my film in game so they use the threat of the soviets and
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:22.320]  you know locking up janitors and file clerks you know that worked at the fbi or
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:24.880]  whatever saying they were commies because they were going to communist
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:27.920]  meetings they believed this is how you empowered the people they were useful
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:31.760]  idiots as lennon would call them he was very useful and they loved him
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:34.960]  the minute he found out well wait there's think tanks funding this
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:39.520]  ford foundation the army wants to merge us with the soviet union because this
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:42.400]  was all being written up at the time by rand in the 50s
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:47.600]  these are now public he freaked out and came out and said the army's running
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:50.480]  communism well yeah the army set up the u n at
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:53.600]  presidio they have to control both sides to create
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:57.040]  the synthesis and then he was politically destroyed
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:00.640]  as big and they got him up before congress and said
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:04.880]  you think the army runs the commies
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:08.400]  and it was over for joseph mccarthy he wasn't useful
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:12.000]  alexa bayah getting into merging us with the soviet union and the rand
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.200]  corporation documents uh we're about to go to break sorry this is a short
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:18.160]  segment but what's your take on what i just talked about i think you're absolutely
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:20.640]  correct i mean i think that you know mccarthy
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:24.720]  pointed out the danger uh you know this this kind of communist infiltration
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:27.280]  was at the time a lot of liberals thought that's not true but actually has
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:30.800]  been proven that yes there was a communist infiltration in this country
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:33.840]  whether they would have tried the soviets open the files he was
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:37.440]  absolutely yes he was correct he was correct i mean you know the way in which
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:40.400]  he went about it perhaps you know could have been better
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:43.360]  but he was on the right track unfortunately you know he was also
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:46.160]  an alcoholic and that was his problem the way in which he presented things in
[01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:50.400]  which we went you know went up because you know destroyed the content the
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:54.400]  useful content but you notice he got destroyed though when he pointed out
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:59.120]  that our own government uh wanted a form of collectivism right exactly but on
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:02.560]  the other hand it was true a lot of people in the government didn't think
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:05.920]  they'd think like that he says yes they thought that that was the way of the
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:10.160]  world you have to remember one thing in the late 1940s a lot of people thought
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:13.760]  that there was no future for capitalism it's hard for us to conceive of that
[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:18.240]  because the soviet union went down flames in the 1980s but in the late 1940s
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:21.600]  they were saying that everybody was saying that there is no future for
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:24.640]  capitalism the soviet economies are going to win
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:27.920]  and you know when you get into that kind of mindset and you start
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:31.760]  again politicizing culture which is you know what happens with that
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:35.120]  that is a great danger to any society and that's what McCarthy was trying to
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:38.480]  point out all right alex back in 70 seconds we have a lot of breaks at the
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:41.280]  end and start of the hour
[01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:51.440]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:54.880]  you've heard alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the
[01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:58.560]  respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:01.840]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and
[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:05.600]  how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:08.880]  body my name is mario safaldi and i'm the
[01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:13.040]  developer of the silver lungs generator not only does the silver lung system
[01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:16.240]  produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:20.080]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:24.320]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:28.560]  this includes the eyes ears nose lungs
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:32.320]  topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system
[01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:35.920]  be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the silver lung system
[01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:42.640]  at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung system works

[01:59:53.520 --> 02:00:00.560]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:11.840]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:18.480]  well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now
[02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:25.120]  live from austin texas alex jones alex obea is our guest in this short
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:28.240]  segment he's going to get into some more of his discoveries
[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:32.400]  in more modern times of rand corporation getting us into iraq and other wars
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:35.360]  then starting in the next segment for several more segments we'll talk to matt
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:40.160]  william john ryan steve and others but no group in the globalist
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:43.760]  social engineering hierarchy the master architects of the new world order
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:48.080]  do you find an organization more powerful more influential than rand
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:51.600]  rand was basically given the quarterbacking job
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:55.200]  by the ford foundation and carnegie endowment to set up
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:59.440]  this corporate world government that collectivizes us through a fake free
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:05.200]  market controlled within a false paradigm of consumerism but it's a
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:08.480]  spectrum they control where they destroy our values our true
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:11.760]  rights our true wealth and give us bobbles instead
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:15.600]  alex obea you wanted to get into iraq and and some of the more modern
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:19.120]  chapters with the rand corporation right because i mean that is such a prime
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:22.800]  example of what they are doing i mean you know for crying out loud you know
[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:25.360]  we still interact right we still have to have
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:29.040]  50 000 over there and you know we're still in afghanistan a lot of people
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:32.240]  asking themselves well what the hell are we doing there and then of course it all
[02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:37.600]  goes back to 9 11 then goes back as well to desert storm and you know
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:40.800]  it's it's ran i mean i'm sorry to say that but
[02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:45.360]  it's the truth it's people who came out of rand i specifically want to point out
[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:49.680]  one gentleman who perhaps your listeners will be aware of his name is
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:53.600]  andrew marshall who is the head of the office of
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:59.840]  net assessment he's been in the pentagon since 1973 and every president
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:04.800]  including president obama right now has reconfirmed him in his post and what is
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:09.840]  his post to dream up new weapons he's the kind of guy who came up with the whole
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:14.080]  concept but you know the star wars approach to missiles you know we went
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:20.800]  into into uh uh into iraq and we we we bombed
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:24.800]  the capital and bagdad and uh the whole concept that you know of
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:30.800]  excess skeletons for people for soldiers uh of drugging drugging troops
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:34.480]  he's the one that ordered west point to make everybody
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:37.600]  read starship troopers the book absolutely
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:40.960]  yes he's the one who's like leading us he's like the leading light
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:44.960]  the man is in his late 80s it's almost 90 right now and he's still there
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:48.720]  he's like he looks like something out of science fiction only it's a science fact
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:52.400]  and he's still there and he was one of the founders of rand
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:56.240]  who came up with you know with the whole concept of the military industrial
[02:02:56.240 --> 02:03:01.520]  compass who developed it right from the 1940s and the 1950s he was there he was
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:05.600]  one of the advisors to the gator report for quite a while and he wants to inject
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:09.440]  all the troops with mind control drugs that's even in wired magazine he says
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:12.000]  it won't be what weapons they have but what drugs they're on
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.680]  absolutely absolutely and the whole rationale for going
[02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:20.400]  into iraq for going into uh desert storm back in the 80s as you have to remember
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:24.000]  this whole stage back to the 1980s is again
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.240]  you know you can you can place it directly to rand studies that came out in
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:33.040]  the early 70s saying after after the uh
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:37.760]  the problem with the 1973 uh with the embargo the oil embargo says
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:40.560]  with the united states has to take control of the middle east
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:44.480]  i mean in so many words that they want to whether it's directly or and
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:48.560]  directly with the united states forces there or indirectly to friendly
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:53.680]  regimes that will do as united states bits and it's been a constant in their
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:56.960]  thinking and it's the last but when they say usa they mean the corporate
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:01.360]  elite that uses us as their muscle exactly i mean because usa to them is
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:05.760]  the small group of technocrats who of course you know disguises itself as an
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:08.720]  element as a democratically elected government but says
[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:12.640]  we are the ones who actually know what the questions are and what the answers
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:16.000]  should be well that's what carol quickly said he
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.960]  said we control both parties we give the illusion of change
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:23.120]  and by controlling the leadership we can continually move our agenda
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:26.160]  towards world government down the road and isn't it true
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:29.600]  isn't that what we're seeing all around us
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:33.120]  and then meanwhile the media will admit world governments here but say it's the
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:36.720]  solution to all our problems but then demonize those of us that say
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:40.080]  there's a world government they say we're crazy it doesn't exist
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:43.040]  i mean if that isn't mind control i don't know what is
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:47.520]  alex obey is our guest alex obey dot com we have links to him up on info wars
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:51.840]  dot com and a prison planet dot com he's an amazing researcher with key
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:54.640]  intel on the globalist internal operations
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:58.240]  we'll be right back with your phone calls on the other side on the gcn radio
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:00.480]  network
[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:04.000]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.200]  power generator number one new climate legislation
[02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:10.240]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[02:05:10.240 --> 02:05:14.080]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:18.000]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.600]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:25.200]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:29.120]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:32.640]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:35.680]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:17.840]  alex abeya one of the leading experts on the rand corporation
[02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:22.320]  emmy nominated news producer best-selling author
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:27.360]  is our guest alex abeya.com's the website alex i want to go to calls but i want
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:31.680]  to get into one other issue uh and for listeners that are new listeners they
[02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:35.760]  won't believe this when i say it so guys search engine right now
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:39.040]  google acquires company that can predict the future
[02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:42.640]  but i remember going back to uh you know declassified
[02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:46.240]  corporate and government documents from even 40 years ago where they said we've
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:50.000]  got to have the uniform you know product code and then they
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:53.920]  wanted biometrics in the 90s to track every purchase you make
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:59.920]  rfid and all the products now search engines using nsa keyword technology
[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:03.760]  to be able to search the third dimension not just cyberspace
[02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:07.120]  but to be able to search the real world and google street view and
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:12.960]  all of that is just one facet of that and they now say they can predict mass
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:16.800]  movements by 99 percent uh in fact there's the headline
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:19.040]  google investment company that predicts the future
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:22.640]  no one saw it coming yeah right and of course that's a pentagon admitted
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:26.240]  funded group in the the company they bought also google admits they're
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:30.320]  basically cia in cutel funded just 11 years ago with total
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:33.280]  dominance now uh and you go back to the rand
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:36.640]  corporation in the 60s and your book talks about this and you
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:39.760]  talk about this in the interview we did with you out in california last week
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:42.880]  when i sent a crew out there that they said that was key to track and
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:46.240]  surveil everyone not so much to know what people are doing because they might
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:50.160]  be terrorist that's just the cover but to understand our hopes and
[02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:53.360]  dreams so they can learn what propaganda is working
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:57.680]  and to literally predict the future to a very electrically that's correct
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:10:00.480]  yes ma'am and now of course you have to remember of course i mean
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:03.840]  another one of rand's beautiful inventions was uh
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:07.840]  the spy satellite uh you know we can also thank them for that
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:12.720]  so you know today google uses that spy satellite to be able to really
[02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:17.120]  you know observe everything that we do down to like not down to the street
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:21.360]  level you know from above from below good tracking of movements everywhere i
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:25.840]  mean i just it's awful it's really awful and we really
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:30.800]  have to do something about it and you also talk about how they
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:35.040]  try to discover every individual's sellout price
[02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:39.200]  right well they figure that everyone is a consumer everyone then has his own
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:42.320]  price that there is a there is a level at which
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:47.520]  you know they will go on and do things that they might not otherwise conceive
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:51.200]  of again goes back to the same rationale that you know people
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:55.120]  are just consumers that people are just creatures that buy and enjoy
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:59.360]  instead of being you know thinking people that you know perhaps believe in
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:02.080]  god that you know believe in family and that
[02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:06.400]  believe in their own country and then they can find everyone's price
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:10.080]  and basically get people to literally sell their intellect their souls
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:14.400]  their identity to these people let's take a phone call
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:17.840]  matt in minnesota you're on the year go ahead
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:22.000]  hey alex and i was going good go ahead hey hi
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:26.880]  hi yeah um info war is actually ran an article a couple years ago in october
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:33.200]  um and it was about ran corporation lobbying the pentagon
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:39.200]  to start a war in order to save the uh collapsing economy
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:42.960]  well that has always been a tenant of the ran corporation i mean they have
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:47.760]  always said that not necessarily so many words but they have always said you
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:50.960]  know there's nothing like a good war to stimulate the economy i mean
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:54.640]  and they point to the uh to the second world war
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:58.480]  they point out you know to vietnam and you know not to mention you know like i
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:02.080]  said we were talking about before you know the iraq war i mean
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:04.720]  you know the war is the health of the state
[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:11.360]  yes it's a state of perpetual war just like i agree we we are definitely in
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:14.240]  perpetual war right now and i i mean i'm wondering if there's anything
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:17.840]  is there's anything new like that out of ran corporation
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:22.960]  um recently where they're you know asking for a war asking for this and
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:26.480]  that uh well there were so many words at this
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:30.240]  and at this point they're not they're not that that's obvious but what they do
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:33.120]  say is that they advocate intervention in certain places
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:36.800]  et cetera for instance in afghanistan i mean they there they have links right
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:39.600]  now with think tanks in afghanistan they've been there since the very
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:43.360]  beginning after i did after after we went in and they post the
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:47.040]  taliban in 911 they've been they've had constant
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:50.400]  communications with them they have a base in katar
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:55.200]  in the arab emirates when they're they're already trying to
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:59.440]  change again the culture of the of the of the place i mentioned that in the
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:01.760]  book uh and that you know they're they're going
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:06.160]  after the educational system they were invited by the emir of of
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:10.320]  of katar and they're trying to change the whole way which the middle east
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:13.840]  thinks about the world in other words which is not that they think that they're
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:16.480]  whether they think that the middle east right now is so wonderful but they're
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:21.440]  trying to change it into again into the consumer mode so instead of making
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:25.840]  the things that are octanus to the to the region that are good in the region
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:29.120]  come out they're trying to shape them into little western consumers instead of
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:32.240]  valuing true freedom which creates incredible wealth
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:35.280]  they give them fake free market consumerism
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:39.840]  which then financially destroys us in the end they tell us get into debt
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:43.680]  all of this designed by these people matt great point appreciate your call
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:46.960]  william in florida you're on the air
[02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:53.680]  hello yes sir yes uh you know i uh please keep me in hold after the question
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:57.360]  because i can only listen on the phone but my question is
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:00.560]  when when alex was reading all of these documents
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:06.560]  did he get any sense of hubris from from these people obviously the very smart
[02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:10.480]  people at the range of their middle name sir
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:13.280]  that's that's exactly i mean obviously what do you expect from people who think
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:17.440]  that they know all the answers i mean anybody who gets about them is
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:20.400]  is cast out you know among the young believers uh
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:24.800]  you know they know everything so the hubris is right there
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:27.840]  right from the very first papers that they have
[02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:31.600]  ever read but do you think it indicates any kind of
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:35.040]  weakness or do you really think that that they
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:38.720]  they do know everything i don't think that they don't
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:42.400]  no they don't know everything that but they're scientifically studying and
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:46.640]  categorizing human behavior in their own words to know how to
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:49.520]  manipulate us exactly and that's why they even set
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:52.160]  up you know the department of social sciences
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:55.680]  originally you know they were just ran was set up to develop new weapons of
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:58.640]  destruction but they realized that in order to develop
[02:14:58.640 --> 02:15:04.320]  and to carry out and and and and to take out the the weapons of destruction
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:08.240]  they had to rely on people in order to have people be able to deliver these
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:11.440]  things they have to convince the people that this is what they should do so
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:14.800]  that's what they set up and they learned how to do
[02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:19.280]  psychological testing to get police officers with low IQs that enjoy
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:23.520]  brutality they learned how to find specialized
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:28.400]  psychological types to fill in their compartmentalized system
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:31.280]  it with the types of people they need i appreciate your call
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:35.200]  but but william let me tell you something um if you're calling in to

[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:09.520]  john in illinois you're on the air hey guys um
[02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:14.640]  have either of you guys seen being there uh it was a movie adapted from uh
[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:19.840]  jersey kozinski novella with peter sellers yes of course right i remember it
[02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:25.440]  oh okay and i i just recently found out that um mr kozinski received grants
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:28.640]  from the guggenheim fellowship in the ford foundation
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:33.840]  um in light of what mr abeya said about um rand involvement in jfk's
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:39.280]  kingmaking um do you think that kozinski knew anything about the rand
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:42.960]  corporation because the you know the characters in the movie their
[02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:45.600]  last name is rand so i mean i think there's an obvious
[02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:49.440]  an obvious reference besides kozinski did move among those circles
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:52.480]  obviously you know he took his life in the 1980s but before then
[02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:56.320]  there's one thing that i mentioned in the book is that rand was extremely
[02:16:56.320 --> 02:17:01.840]  uh involved in new york city governance uh under john lincey and that's when
[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:07.120]  kozinski was at his prime at his peak when he wrote the painted bird when he
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:10.320]  wrote being there when he wrote all those novels those wonderful novels that he
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:13.520]  wrote obviously that's wrong you know painted bird is a novel i mean he just
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:18.240]  made up the whole story what happened to him in poland uh and uh so yes he was
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:22.000]  very familiar with all these people and you know because these these were guys
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:27.600]  were advising john john lincey on how to run the city
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:31.920]  and how to be you know how to take the whole system that i worked in the pentagon
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:37.280]  and to apply it yeah they were using new york and then later la as models of how
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:40.480]  to basically have the military industrial complex totally secretly
[02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:44.240]  federalized and bring in their system of governance i appreciate your call
[02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:48.560]  speaking of movies obviously dr strangelove stanley kerbick's film
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:52.000]  you know they call it the bland corporation the mineshaft gap
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:57.360]  talk about those parallels well certainly i mean that dr strangelove was
[02:17:57.360 --> 02:18:01.520]  was it was a takeoff on a lot of the precepts that ran
[02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:05.760]  issued during the late 1950s and early 60s you know saying that yes we can win a
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:08.800]  nuclear war that you will be able to survive
[02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:12.960]  in tunnels and mineshafts and there will be food there will be a portion to
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:15.600]  certain people and some of it will be contaminated but that
[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:19.760]  will be given you know to animals and old people who anyhow have to die
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:23.200]  so it's that kind of thinking and also like the whole machine that they have
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:27.120]  the doomsday machine that they have in the uh in the movie well that
[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:30.880]  actually was described in a paper in a ram paper
[02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:34.800]  and then it was popularized by herman kahn herman kahn was the lecturer
[02:18:34.800 --> 02:18:37.920]  you know who uh who came went around the country
[02:18:37.920 --> 02:18:42.160]  given lectures on how to survive the nuclear war and he wrote the best seller
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:45.120]  called unthermal nuclear war as a matter of fact i'm looking at it
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:49.760]  right now even as we speak here and and and and and his character in the movie
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:53.440]  is dr strangelove absolutely yes mind the fear
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:57.280]  i can walk of course animals would have to be bred
[02:18:57.280 --> 02:19:01.920]  and slaughtered there would have to be 10 females to each man because of the
[02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:06.080]  incredible responsibility they will be chosen for their beauty
[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:10.720]  in fact in fact uh cuprick took so many lines and so many concepts from what
[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:14.480]  kahn wrote that you know kahn said hey you know i should get royalties
[02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:17.840]  something of course it'll be quite easy to construct
[02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:21.680]  such a machine all you have to have is a rear
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:26.320]  and a group of complex of computers connected to belly bombs
[02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:29.680]  but why didn't you tell the world that's right
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:33.840]  all of that i mean obviously it's it's exaggerated a little bit but not much
[02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:38.160]  believe me not much i mean the comic effect comes from the context
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:42.160]  and george c scott we just so happen to have a plan plan r for just this
[02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:45.760]  contingency will only lose 10 20 million tops i wouldn't say we can get our

[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:15.120]  the rand corporation later dick chaining and others
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:19.440]  came out in congress in 1986 and the oliver north hearings
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:23.840]  planned on staging crises in these countries not just in the united states
[02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:27.440]  but all over the western world and terror attacks
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:31.360]  or war with the soviets as a pretext for totally
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:35.200]  reorganizing society and rand wanted that nuclear war
[02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:39.120]  they wanted to be hit by the soviets and have much of the u.s wiped out
[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:44.080]  so they could completely rebuild everything and on its ashes build a
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:47.920]  world government and reduce population uh in
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:51.840]  the aftermath of that attack and that's what's covered in the film
[02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:55.120]  by stanley kubrick of course dr strange love
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:59.280]  uh i know that there was a lot of pressure put out to even delay the
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:02.480]  release of the film and the government was actually upset with some of the
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:06.240]  things that stanley kubrick was doing or was that just a cover was stanley kubrick
[02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:09.840]  involved with the government so i don't know where he was not
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:14.800]  no no but uh here's the thing which i've always found kind of curious that
[02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:19.600]  originally um the movie was supposed to be a serious movie
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:23.360]  uh it was not supposed to be a satire as it is right now
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:27.200]  and ultimately uh you know he decided to make it funny
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:30.800]  so the question then becomes well did he decide to make it funny so as to
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:36.800]  diffuse the theories and uh the opinions and notions that come out in
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:40.320]  that that actually do exist that actually are taken for
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:43.920]  serious uh by people and but you know by by people the
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:50.320]  technocrats who want to rule the country or was he also you know involved in
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:54.480]  in this whole thing and then away he said well i'm gonna do this but i'm gonna
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:58.080]  make it so like everybody laughs at it so they won't realize that this is
[02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:01.120]  actually what's going on and i know that some of the
[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:04.240]  government agencies actually went and talked to kubrick and said how did you
[02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:11.440]  know about the d scrambler codes for the nuclear launch orders to be sent to the
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:17.200]  uh bombers the b-52s i mean he had so much internal information a lot of it
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:20.320]  that wasn't made public at the time but has since been made public right
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:23.760]  exactly because you know he was getting he was getting all the info from from
[02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:26.240]  the rand corporation were people within the rand corporation from herman
[02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:29.680]  kahn who you know who had been one of the luminaries of the of the rand
[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:33.440]  corporation during the 1950s and they worked on a doomsday device
[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:38.080]  oh absolutely oh yes that was one of that was one of the main things of the of
[02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:42.160]  of of kahn's presentations and of his book on thermonuclear war i mean i have
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:46.320]  that in my book and you know and he wanted to to jacket them in cobalt and
[02:27:46.320 --> 02:27:51.200]  other things to create just deadly radiation well rand was also involved
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:55.840]  in the uses of the h-bomb i mean after all i mean
[02:27:55.840 --> 02:28:00.960]  look the h-bomb the a-bomb the bomb rand is there from the beginning
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:04.640]  the the genesis of rand is that it's supposed to be
[02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:07.760]  uh another manhattan project that developed the a-bomb
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:12.240]  because it was set up by this general i named arnold and uh frank cobalt who
[02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:16.400]  was his assistant and and kurtis lemay who later became
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:22.400]  illiterate chief of staff uh uh and and what they wanted to do is
[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:26.960]  create a situation whereby uh you would have scientists and
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:30.960]  military working together uh in an environment that would be agreeable to the
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:33.760]  scientists who then would be able to develop the kind of weapons that the
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:37.680]  military wanted right obviously the military then got it to who
[02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:40.480]  stand with the military industrial complex and those industrialists was
[02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:44.400]  good to make so much money out of what was being developed so it's right
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:48.480]  from the beginning and like i said the rand corporation did studies on the
[02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:51.280]  use of the h-bomb by studies that were only you know
[02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:55.120]  they classified a few years ago and you know how many people would die
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:58.880]  how much radiation it would take what would happen etc etc and all that
[02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:03.440]  information then came out you know in uh dr strachlove because it was being
[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:06.960]  fed to kubrik by herman kahn and there's a scene
[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:12.400]  with uh one of the top generals uh played by george c scott where they
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:15.360]  know the nukes are now going to be dropped the doomsday russian device is
[02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:19.120]  going to detonate and they say we happen to have a report
[02:29:19.120 --> 02:29:24.000]  prepared for this exact eventuality by the bland corporation not the rand the
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:27.840]  bland and then they open up you know basically the same report about
[02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:31.920]  we've got a contingency this nuclear war is going to be a good thing
[02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:35.520]  and the rand corporation almost worships the bomb at their facilities as you
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:40.080]  know in california they've got a big giant h-bomb sculpture of a mushroom
[02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:43.520]  cloud made up out of chain link we're going to come back

[02:32:03.200 --> 02:32:07.600]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:32:07.600 --> 02:32:11.040]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:32:11.040 --> 02:32:14.720]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:32:14.720 --> 02:32:18.880]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:22.560]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:26.960]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:30.880]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:34.000]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:38.000]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:41.760]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in
[02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:45.040]  the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old

[02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:01.440]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[02:33:01.440 --> 02:33:07.120]  mr president one of two points i'd like to make if i may
[02:33:07.120 --> 02:33:13.920]  go ahead general one our hopes for recalling the 843rd
[02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:17.520]  bobling are quickly being reduced to a very low order of
[02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:21.680]  problem two less than 15 minutes from now the
[02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:26.640]  russkins will be making radar contact with the planes three when they do they
[02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:29.280]  are going to go absolutely eight and they're going to strike back with
[02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:34.080]  everything they got four if prior to this time
[02:33:34.080 --> 02:33:37.280]  we have done nothing further to suppress their retaliatory capabilities
[02:33:37.280 --> 02:33:42.480]  we will suffer virtual annihilation now
[02:33:43.680 --> 02:33:49.760]  five if on the other hand
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:54.080]  we were to immediately launch and all out and coordinated the pack on all their
[02:33:54.080 --> 02:33:56.880]  airfields and missile bases we'd stand a damn good chance of catching them with
[02:33:56.880 --> 02:33:59.680]  their pants down hell we got a fire with our missile
[02:33:59.680 --> 02:34:03.280]  superiority as it is we'd easily assign three missiles to every target and
[02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:07.200]  still have a very effective reserve force for any other contingents
[02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:10.880]  say it an unofficial study which we undertook of this
[02:34:10.880 --> 02:34:15.360]  eventuality indicated that we would destroy 90 percent
[02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:18.800]  of their nuclear capabilities we would therefore prevail
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:22.560]  and suffer only modest and acceptable civilian casualties from the remaining
[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:26.400]  force which would be badly damaged and uncoordinated
[02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:29.760]  general it is the proud policy of our country
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:33.440]  never to strike first with nuclear weapons well this president i would i
[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:36.400]  would say that general ripper has already invalidated that policy
[02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:39.760]  that was not an act of national policy and there are still alternatives left
[02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:44.000]  open to us this president
[02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:48.240]  we are rapidly approaching a moment of truth both for ourselves as human beings
[02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:52.080]  and for the life of our nation now truth is not always a pleasant thing
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:56.080]  but it is necessary now to make a choice to choose between two
[02:34:56.080 --> 02:34:59.600]  admittedly regrettable but nevertheless distinguishable
[02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:03.200]  post-war environments one where you got 20 million people killed and the other
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:06.720]  where you got 150 million people killed you're talking about mass murder
[02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:10.480]  general not war mr president i'm not saying we wouldn't
[02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:15.520]  get our hair must but i do say no more than 10 to 20 million killed
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:18.800]  top
[02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:23.680]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:29.440]  it's alex jones remember what came out even in the new york times three and a
[02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:32.800]  half years ago
[02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:36.160]  that the pentagon now has a first strike
[02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:40.240]  where they preemptively invade countries you saw that with iraq
[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:43.440]  but that they want to hit iran with hundreds of quote
[02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:48.160]  many nukes and they've had their pr firms going saying well these aren't like
[02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:51.280]  your daddy's nukes your grandpappy's nukes
[02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:54.560]  we need to start preemptively striking people with nukes
[02:35:54.560 --> 02:35:59.120]  well that's kurtis lemay that's con that's the ran corporation isn't alex
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:01.920]  abeya absolutely absolutely they were advocating this
[02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:05.360]  advocated this time and again time and again i mean
[02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:08.960]  look you know i mean originally i always thought that i never much
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:13.600]  admired an hour but the more i read about them and the more i studied ran the
[02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:18.000]  more i realized what a bulwark he was i mean how he stood up against his people
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:21.600]  said there's no way i'm gonna and they thought kennedy was going to be some
[02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:26.160]  sex addict that they could control yeah exactly exactly and it you know march
[02:36:26.160 --> 02:36:30.400]  through surprise but you know by late 1962 early 63 he started saying hey
[02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:34.320]  you know hold on there fellas i'm not going along with your plans
[02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:37.520]  and you know what happened and right now at prism planet dot tv we're showing
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:40.400]  google street view one of their little creations
[02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:44.640]  of the front of the ran corporation there on the coastline by los angeles
[02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:49.760]  with the giant uh sculpture of a of a mushroom cloud
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:54.080]  going off made out of chain links beautiful building though isn't it
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:57.840]  yes it's just amazing that they'd read your previous
[02:36:57.840 --> 02:37:01.120]  book and thought hey this guy's hey okay and had no idea that you'd get into all
[02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:05.680]  their stuff and blow them wide open i was just telling it to the brother
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:08.640]  all right let's rampage through five or six calls because i do need to get some
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:12.160]  other key news here today and a very disturbing
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:16.000]  little conversation that i had with joe strupp
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:19.440]  of media matters yesterday before we end this hour but
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:21.760]  so please have your questions ready i want to get to all of you i love your
[02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:25.200]  calls but quick question quick comment ryan steve dan larry thomas
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:28.880]  because i want to try to get to all of you quick response back from alex abeya
[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:32.160]  uh let's talk to ryan in illinois you're on the air
[02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:38.160]  hi alex and alex um uh great book um great show um my quick question is um
[02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:41.520]  about herman conan the uh hudson institute um
[02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:44.640]  it seems that they're i can't tell whether they're good or bad they're on
[02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:47.040]  one hand they're talking about you know the
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:50.320]  overpopulation how it you know it's a myth and that everything's going to be
[02:37:50.320 --> 02:37:53.040]  all right and also you know they're they're demonizing
[02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:56.880]  prozac use and things like that um so there's
[02:37:56.880 --> 02:37:59.840]  very mixed messages i don't know what they're trying to do if they're trying
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:02.880]  to gain our confidence or just your thoughts on that i mean well the hudson
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:05.280]  institute obviously you know what happened is when
[02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:10.240]  and herman con broke the secret because that's the whole thing
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:13.280]  if the ryan had the corporation the ryan corporation at the time into this very
[02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:16.480]  day you know they're they're technocrats they
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:19.360]  take their their cabal they're like the high priest
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:23.360]  they tell everybody what to do uh so therefore con went out and he actually
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:28.320]  popularized all these things right and then he was forced to leave ryan and
[02:38:28.320 --> 02:38:32.080]  after he left he founded the hudson institute which concentrated on
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:34.720]  futurology you know how the world's gonna turn out
[02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:40.160]  again because of that misguided belief in the redemptive powers of science and
[02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:43.040]  get us the results of that that's you know when they come up with all these
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:46.000]  different things but you know they're slightly off the wall
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:49.120]  yeah and they have different scientists and different
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:53.040]  people in the think tanks who have even different views they get they test
[02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:57.360]  for all the idiot savants in specialized areas and then they let them
[02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:01.280]  operate just to get their data so yeah you'll have somebody one of these groups
[02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:04.560]  who's saying psychotropic and drugs are destroying our country
[02:39:04.560 --> 02:39:07.920]  but and i've seen what you're talking about but that's but but they'll use
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:11.040]  their material in another way you understand that
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:14.240]  yeah it's kind of like one back you know he tells 90 of the truth and he you
[02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:17.520]  know just leads you on another another path what's right
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:21.520]  that's right you got that straight all right ryan appreciate it steven
[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:24.480]  california you're on the air hi alex
[02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:29.040]  hey by alex and alex thank you guys hey real quick uh
[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:32.080]  i appreciate what you're doing i i want to share something that i've actually
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:35.360]  lived through and i've actually met with erin russo and trying to get my film
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:39.920]  out i've been in a patriot group and i want to ask a question too for alex
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:45.120]  the veya on on iron mountain if that really happened was not no it's not
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:49.120]  but however what it did do i am on for those listeners to know about it is
[02:39:49.120 --> 02:39:53.520]  this particular document that came out in the late 1960s made to late
[02:39:53.520 --> 02:39:58.000]  65 recall correctly in which it was supposed to be like the
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:02.800]  guideline like a life got a plot of a small group of people from the
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:06.480]  government i met every once in a while in order to
[02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:10.240]  how to take over the government and to come in the government and the world
[02:40:10.240 --> 02:40:13.840]  and no that was that was acknowledged as a satire but the sad truth about it is
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:18.480]  that a lot of things that i mentioned were true only the way that it came out
[02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:22.880]  was false it's just like dr strangelove exactly
[02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:26.480]  yeah just tie it in there guys on lucid in the DARPA system
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:30.640]  in these lists you know i i've lived through
[02:40:30.640 --> 02:40:33.920]  uh a miscarriage of justice where my children have been taken from me i've
[02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:37.600]  been kind of labeled someone said there's a flag by my name
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:41.360]  and it seems to me that uh they are making lists
[02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:45.360]  and tying it in with you know clinton and carol quigley that
[02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:49.520]  these people really think that they were better off world by them
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:53.760]  and the female thing it's all true i mean i've seen documents like the marines
[02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:57.840]  and 29 palms would you fire upon american people if they do not give up
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:01.360]  their guns when a 30-day amnesty period is given no no that's on record
[02:41:01.360 --> 02:41:03.680]  steve i've got to go those we're almost out of time
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:07.360]  any comments on the military being turned against the people
[02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:11.840]  alex they were surprised me they were surprised because you know that's in the
[02:41:11.840 --> 02:41:14.080]  plant and that's what they got to do that's what they got to do that's all
[02:41:14.080 --> 02:41:17.200]  the military just following orders and these guys think well you know we know
[02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:21.360]  best dan in michigan you're on the air with alex
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:23.680]  abeya
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:30.160]  um yeah dan you want to talk yeah i think i have a question
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:34.320]  about john nash i wonder if he could uh yeah i don't know
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:39.280]  uh john nash was that brilliant uh a mathematician and and uh one of the
[02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:42.160]  creators of game theory although he wasn't as big as
[02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:46.400]  he was made out to be in the movie uh what was it uh brilliant uh a beautiful
[02:41:46.400 --> 02:41:50.160]  mind beautiful mind thank you right he was in rand for a couple of years ran at
[02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:54.560]  the time in the 1950s was like the center of game theory
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:57.840]  matter of fact without rand probably game theory as you know today would not
[02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:03.040]  exist because they thought that with game theory they'd be able to uh figure
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:06.640]  out what the soviet union was going to do next because at the time soviet union
[02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:10.240]  was a closed society our spies in the soviet union were not getting much
[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:14.480]  information so they're trying to pause it away by which they could say well
[02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:17.920]  coveted is going to act this way so therefore we should act that way
[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:21.760]  and so you know nash was there for a couple of years but you know he went in
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:25.200]  and out and as mentioned in his uh and his biography
[02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:29.040]  you know we get at the most of it the crucial things that he developed he
[02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:32.720]  did at princeton not necessarily all right dan thank you good question larry

[02:43:05.680 --> 02:43:10.480]  little did i know about bohemian grove and that sort of thing

[02:43:29.120 --> 02:43:32.560]  and uh before i could get out there he had already
[02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:36.640]  his life out of this year he came by and sprayed it completely around
[02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:40.080]  up well i'm sorry to hear that larry that's a
[02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:44.640]  a big problem we've got a move here because we're almost out of time
[02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:47.680]  uh let's try to finish up with a quick question from thomas in arkansas
[02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:51.440]  thomas you're on the air yes sir thank you alex and alex
[02:43:51.440 --> 02:43:55.920]  um uh just a quick question i haven't read the book i planned to because i want
[02:43:55.920 --> 02:44:00.080]  to see what my brother's up to he's an analyst with rand i wanted to know if
[02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:05.280]  you mentioned anything there about the security clearances of the analysts
[02:44:05.280 --> 02:44:09.440]  no not directly i know that everybody is you know is
[02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:13.520]  goes through security clearance in order to be able to be hired by them
[02:44:13.520 --> 02:44:17.600]  uh i myself went through one uh the thing that i was helped by the fact
[02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:23.360]  that you know my brother at one point and had worked for for uh for a place
[02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:27.120]  where he got uh a lot of a high level of clearance
[02:44:27.120 --> 02:44:31.120]  but i don't specifically go into that although i have heard from analysts who
[02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:34.000]  have read this i went to conferences and stuff like that
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.880]  and they said you know the totally agree with us in the book and that there's
[02:44:36.880 --> 02:44:40.720]  nothing wrong in the book itself well you were clearly led into one level of
[02:44:40.720 --> 02:44:44.480]  the security ring the deepest anybody outside never been allowed to right uh
[02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:46.480]  but we know it goes even a lot deeper than that
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:49.200]  absolutely a great question thomas sorry we're out of time

[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:30.960]  without my knowledge and at first i kind of ignored it but as it gained steam i
[02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:33.920]  thought well i i guess people want us to go to the next level
[02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:38.160]  and it was that money that came in that 300 000 dollars that allowed us
[02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:42.080]  uh to move to these new offices we use the second money bomb to expand the
[02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:44.400]  amount of equipment and employees we had
[02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:49.680]  and here we are in 2010 i wasn't going to do a money bomb people were like well

[02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:50.560]  of the studios we were able to build with the last two money bombs
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:54.000]  and the new shell of the studio we completed
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.960]  now we need to put the equipment in get the employees
[02:47:56.960 --> 02:48:00.640]  the computers you know the air conditioning systems all that stuff
[02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:03.760]  that goes along with it but the shell is now there
[02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:07.840]  because we realize that humanity is at a historic crossroads
[02:48:07.840 --> 02:48:12.960]  and that info wars.com my radio show our films the websites
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:17.360]  really is at the tip of the spear i mean who can you point to
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:21.200]  who is having a bigger effect in waking people up to the true nature
[02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:25.600]  of this global tyranny we're facing the good news is humanity is
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:30.480]  really waking up right now the the expansion of understanding is
[02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:35.280]  exponential and so i'm not going to sit here idly by
[02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:38.640]  and you know just continue at the same level i'm going to
[02:48:38.640 --> 02:48:44.080]  up our game against the globalist and i would ask you to join us
[02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:48.240]  in that historic mission and so a special 27 hour
[02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:52.800]  live transmission kicking off thursday october 14th
[02:48:52.800 --> 02:48:56.320]  and running until 3 p.m on the following friday
[02:48:56.320 --> 02:48:59.520]  will be taking place i've never done anything like this
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:02.160]  and i hope that you will join us because we're going to be having live
[02:49:02.160 --> 02:49:05.680]  interviews also special behind the scenes interviews

[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:13.600]  interviews in their entirety that are in some of our upcoming films
[02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:17.920]  this is going to be a really special event and i hope you'll join us in this
[02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:21.760]  because we won't save the world by this money bomb we won't save the world by
[02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:27.360]  this 27 hour broadcast but it will be a little piece
[02:49:27.360 --> 02:49:31.040]  of that overall victory against tyranny because it is
[02:49:31.040 --> 02:49:34.560]  the spirit of liberty the spirit of 1776
[02:49:34.560 --> 02:49:38.400]  the spirit of resistance that will bring down
[02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:41.600]  this corporate tyranny that is setting up world government openly
[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:46.480]  and i'll close with this as the french philosopher more than 150 years ago
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:51.680]  victor hugo said no army can stop an idea
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:55.200]  whose time has come we've done our best and we've had
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:50:00.160]  incredible success against tyranny but at the end of the day
[02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:05.920]  in the final equation it is up to you has the idea
[02:50:05.920 --> 02:50:09.920]  of a rebirth of liberty and freedom and a renaissance for all
[02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:13.040]  to live their lives as they see fit and to be left alone
[02:50:13.040 --> 02:50:16.880]  by an all-powerful state is that an idea
[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:22.720]  whose time has come as patrick henry said i know not what
[02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:26.880]  course others may take but as for me give me liberty
[02:50:26.880 --> 02:50:31.120]  or give me death i'll see you live october 14th

[02:54:19.840 --> 02:54:23.680]  joe strupp and he's written for some of the biggest publications in the
[02:54:23.680 --> 02:54:26.320]  country and it was a bizarre hour-long
[02:54:26.320 --> 02:54:30.320]  conversation because he was talking about a few months ago this
[02:54:30.320 --> 02:54:34.400]  highway shooter had a shootout with cops thank god nobody was killed
[02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:39.520]  this Byron Williams who the the court and the police are allowing to talk to
[02:54:39.520 --> 02:54:43.280]  media matters and he was supposedly a glenback
[02:54:43.280 --> 02:54:46.960]  fan and a fan of my show according to the guy's website
[02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:51.280]  and the guy kept saying well how do you respond to glenback calling for violence
[02:54:51.280 --> 02:54:54.720]  against the tides foundation this guy was going to shoot up he says
[02:54:54.720 --> 02:54:58.000]  and i said well give me the quote he says it's in the story so we read the
[02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:01.680]  whole story together over the phone there was no calls to violence nothing
[02:55:01.680 --> 02:55:04.560]  he goes okay well that's not in there but still and and you know what do you
[02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:07.520]  say for yourself and then he goes and what about napolitano being
[02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:10.480]  discredited you know for believing a 9-11 truth
[02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:14.240]  on your show last week i said we didn't talk about 9-11 truth he doesn't get
[02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:18.480]  into 9-11 truth and he said yeah yeah he does yeah he does respond
[02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:23.440]  and then i it was weird i mean so and i said you're trying to drive a wedge
[02:55:23.440 --> 02:55:26.240]  you're gonna try to falsely quote me saying he was on my show about 9-11
[02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:31.920]  truth when he was on about taxes and the economy i mean really bizarre
[02:55:31.920 --> 02:55:35.760]  and maybe the guy just was out of it or whatever he had this all happy go lucky
[02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:40.240]  attitude but it was a bizarre interview i'm like 20 times he had to say
[02:55:40.240 --> 02:55:42.960]  and then he's like did you record this did you record this i was like no i
[02:55:42.960 --> 02:55:46.080]  didn't record it well you're not really allowed to you
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:50.160]  know and it was it was just really strange so then he was denying george
