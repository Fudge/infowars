[00:00.000 --> 00:13.500]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.500 --> 00:36.980]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.980 --> 00:44.900]  ladies and gentlemen we are live thank you so much for joining us on this Monday edition
[00:44.900 --> 00:53.380]  it is already the 14th day of October 2013 we're going to be live here for the next three
[00:53.380 --> 01:00.220]  hours it is times like these and I really quite frankly have trouble even doing the
[01:00.220 --> 01:06.580]  radio show and there have been very few times in my 18 years on air that I have had
[01:06.580 --> 01:13.780]  trouble coming on air and even trying to break down what's happening because it's all so over
[01:13.780 --> 01:24.220]  the top awe-inspiring in a bad kind of way the fact that society is degenerating so quickly
[01:24.220 --> 01:30.340]  the fact that the general public has no bearings on average and has been brought up by television
[01:30.340 --> 01:37.140]  and that our entire culture is becoming a fantasy land of narcissistic dumb-down mental
[01:37.140 --> 01:49.100]  patients running around clicking and fiddling with their iPads and iPhones and I'm not trying
[01:49.100 --> 01:56.180]  to be negative when I say that it's just that it's true there is a mass of people who were
[01:56.180 --> 02:10.460]  basically walking dead they're zombies and then you've got the overlords the twisted
[02:10.460 --> 02:22.060]  social engineers who are greasing the skids for all of the horrible things that are happening
[02:22.060 --> 02:27.020]  in society they're not even behind some of it quite a bit of it but they they certainly
[02:27.020 --> 02:34.140]  set up businesses and systems to to capture all of the flailing lemmings that fall into
[02:34.140 --> 02:44.020]  their web and then at the same time the globalists are targeting anyone virtuous truthful good
[02:44.020 --> 02:50.820]  wholesome honest loving compassionate beautiful honorable it really is evil I mean wouldn't
[02:50.820 --> 02:57.340]  know why all this is happening there is just pure evil there are systems of evil and we're
[02:57.340 --> 03:06.300]  going to be breaking that down today obviously you saw in Louisiana the ebt electronic federal
[03:06.300 --> 03:12.260]  food stamp credit cards their credit cards the American people have to pay for it workers
[03:12.260 --> 03:17.260]  have to pay for it your children will pay for it I will pay for it anyone who works
[03:17.260 --> 03:21.580]  and pays the exorbitant taxes will pay for it suddenly the cards all over the country
[03:21.580 --> 03:27.540]  weren't working in many areas of the nation nationwide is CBS reported and then suddenly
[03:27.540 --> 03:34.300]  they went from saying zero to saying unlimited so folks at multiple Walmart's in Louisiana
[03:34.300 --> 03:42.660]  that's where the Walmartians graze suddenly they went completely crazy and began just
[03:42.660 --> 03:48.620]  filling their shopping carts with whatever they could get in them that's covered by ebt
[03:48.620 --> 03:57.740]  food and things like that and got away with just a massive amount of GMO food and other
[03:57.740 --> 04:01.980]  other chemical and bio weapons masquerading as food at Walmart so they got away with their
[04:01.980 --> 04:09.740]  soft kill meals and then the police had to show up and and stop everybody explaining
[04:09.740 --> 04:14.780]  that I know there's a malfunction but that's separate what happened in Louisiana in two
[04:14.780 --> 04:25.420]  cities is from coast to coast ebt card stopped working for a day over the weekend well I
[04:25.420 --> 04:33.620]  guess Saturday and it caused panic and and and freakouts all over the nation I believe
[04:33.620 --> 04:39.140]  as Rob do said to me this morning I agree with him I believe this is probably a test
[04:39.140 --> 04:44.100]  the globalists are scientific in their approach in every way this is a test to see what'll
[04:44.100 --> 04:48.620]  happen you know they're having that drill that starts in November for shutting down
[04:48.620 --> 04:54.940]  the power on the east coast and martial law all of this has been set up for over a year

[07:05.980 --> 07:11.980]  remember this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA secret plan to
[07:11.980 --> 07:18.020]  begin hoarding emergency survival food it has always been my belief that it's key to stand
[07:18.020 --> 07:23.900]  behind companies who share the same values as their fellow patriots my patriot supply

[07:48.740 --> 07:53.780]  today with the new world order making rapid advances on every front it is essential to
[07:53.780 --> 08:15.300]  prepare with my patriot supply today in the councils of government we must guard against
[08:15.300 --> 08:41.540]  the
[08:41.540 --> 08:45.540]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[08:58.540 --> 09:00.540]  I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree with me.
[09:00.540 --> 09:04.540]  AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[09:04.540 --> 09:10.540]  Guns will be caked and no one will be able to be off.
[09:10.540 --> 09:12.540]  We're gonna take all the guns.
[09:12.540 --> 09:16.540]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in America.
[09:16.540 --> 09:18.540]  The city's global governance at last.
[09:18.540 --> 09:21.540]  Is it one world, the central bank is in charge?
[09:21.540 --> 09:24.540]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[09:24.540 --> 09:29.540]  And for me, give me liberty, or give me death!
[09:29.540 --> 09:36.540]  Live from the Infowars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[09:41.540 --> 09:43.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[09:43.540 --> 09:47.540]  It is Monday, the 14th day of October 2013.
[09:47.540 --> 09:51.540]  We'll be live here for the next three hours, Lord Welling.
[09:51.540 --> 09:55.540]  We have the active duty servicemen from Fort Hood, the officer joining us.
[09:55.540 --> 10:01.540]  He was arrested for going on a hike with his son in the countryside with an M4.
[10:01.540 --> 10:05.540]  He is facing criminal charges and is going to trial.
[10:05.540 --> 10:06.540]  We're gonna have him on.
[10:06.540 --> 10:09.540]  Of course, his case became national news when it first happened.
[10:09.540 --> 10:15.540]  He's gonna be joining us about 30 minutes via Skype in the next hour, in the third hour.
[10:15.540 --> 10:18.540]  And then we're also gonna look at another gentleman being persecuted,
[10:18.540 --> 10:22.540]  not allowed to have a Kickstarter program because it was promoting the Second Amendment.
[10:22.540 --> 10:28.540]  We're seeing massive discrimination against anyone that promotes American ideals or values.
[10:28.540 --> 10:32.540]  We're also seeing the Democratic Party officially fundraise.
[10:32.540 --> 10:42.540]  I'm gonna get into that after I cover the EBT shutdown and Walmart looting, you could call it.
[10:42.540 --> 10:53.540]  But first off, I want to break down the fact that at the bottom of the hour,
[10:53.540 --> 10:59.540]  I'm going to get into this article that's up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[10:59.540 --> 11:02.540]  On the front page from last night, Anthony Gucciardi wrote the story.
[11:02.540 --> 11:08.540]  Radio host Michael Savage calls for answers over missing Nuke Report.
[11:08.540 --> 11:12.540]  And it's a 16-minute segment where Savage breaks it down.
[11:12.540 --> 11:19.540]  It's invaluable listening from Dr. Savage because he's a really smart guy, obviously,
[11:19.540 --> 11:27.540]  and can really condense things down simply but also complexly at the same time to explain why it's so important.
[11:27.540 --> 11:32.540]  So it takes me an hour to break down why this Nuke story is so important, the missing Nuke story.
[11:32.540 --> 11:40.540]  Savage does it in 16 minutes. That article with that video and audio is up on infowars.com.
[11:40.540 --> 11:46.540]  Now remember there were missing Nuke's in 2007. It was a big national scandal.
[11:46.540 --> 11:55.540]  Our source that's high level said that quite a few Nuke's on multiple trucks left the base that weren't even supposed to be at the base
[11:55.540 --> 11:58.540]  and there was a big deal about it because the paperwork wasn't there.
[11:58.540 --> 12:01.540]  There was no paperwork and the base commander ordered it.
[12:01.540 --> 12:06.540]  I came out and said, maybe it's a drill. Maybe they're dummy warheads. We don't know.
[12:06.540 --> 12:09.540]  Our source doesn't know. They were told they were real. We need to get answers.
[12:09.540 --> 12:12.540]  The Air Force base never responded.
[12:12.540 --> 12:21.540]  Media matters run by the White House and all the usual suspects have not come out and made fun of me for the report and said it's a lie.
[12:21.540 --> 12:26.540]  By the way, I wish they would. I don't want this stuff to be true or accurate, okay?
[12:26.540 --> 12:31.540]  Because the different scenarios involving it run from bad to worse.
[12:31.540 --> 12:37.540]  When this happened back in September 3rd and I covered it off and on for a week and it kind of faded away, I was like, oh great.
[12:37.540 --> 12:42.540]  Maybe it's no big deal. Everything's fine. Just some secret operation.
[12:42.540 --> 12:50.540]  But my gut told me, danger, danger, danger, spidey sense, danger, Will Robinson.
[12:50.540 --> 13:03.540]  In fact, my gut is so freaked out about it that I'm not enjoying doing my radio show anymore.
[13:03.540 --> 13:09.540]  I mean, that's really all I can say. I can't put up with any crap anymore from anybody.
[13:09.540 --> 13:16.540]  I can't get into petty stuff with people anymore. I mean, I just, it's very painful being so serious.
[13:16.540 --> 13:21.540]  It's very painful seeing a nation of people that act like lobotomized children.
[13:21.540 --> 13:24.540]  And I don't say that from an elitist perspective.
[13:24.540 --> 13:31.540]  I just see people obsessing over football and obsessing over narcissism and all the rest of it.
[13:31.540 --> 13:35.540]  And then I live in the real world where they put cancer viruses and all the major vaccines on record.
[13:35.540 --> 13:42.540]  Deadly fluoride in the water on record. GMOs that kill the rats they feed them to.
[13:42.540 --> 13:48.540]  At massive numbers. I mean, I'm just living in the Twilight Zone episode and I realize it.
[13:48.540 --> 13:58.540]  And I'm not on some high horse either. I just can't believe that the general public is so pathetic.
[13:58.540 --> 14:02.540]  On average, there are a lot of wonderful people out there, a lot better than I.
[14:02.540 --> 14:06.540]  But they don't see themselves as leaders and they don't take action. Where is the media?
[14:06.540 --> 14:12.540]  I mean, if the story isn't true about the nukes, then it should come out and I should be escoriated.
[14:12.540 --> 14:17.540]  Or my source should be exposed as being wrong and that's the way this should work.
[14:17.540 --> 14:20.540]  Instead, no one will talk about it a month in.
[14:20.540 --> 14:27.540]  And then I learned the day we reported this, hours later they fired the top number two nuke commander in the country.
[14:27.540 --> 14:34.540]  Then they fired the number one nuke commander. And then the AP said it was leaked to them the White House once it's secret.
[14:34.540 --> 14:39.540]  And it was because of a loss of trust by the president in the commander.
[14:39.540 --> 14:46.540]  The head of all nuclear forces, Major General.
[14:46.540 --> 14:57.540]  You got that going on and then you got Lindsey Graham saying South Carolina will be nuked and that's where the nukes were supposedly going.
[14:57.540 --> 15:04.540]  You've got a drill for martial law on the East Coast coming up officially next month.
[15:04.540 --> 15:24.540]  You've got other financial drills going on being put on by the federal government and FinCEN and FSISAC.
[15:24.540 --> 15:31.540]  You've got the welfare cards going down. It's clearly a test.
[15:31.540 --> 15:42.540]  All of this is happening and it just makes me get even sicker inside as I feel impending doom.
[15:42.540 --> 15:46.540]  At a level I've never felt it before. And again, you say you feel it.
[15:46.540 --> 15:51.540]  Your brain has all these thousands of points that the conscious mind can't even collate but the subconscious can.
[15:51.540 --> 15:55.540]  And then at a gut level, I feel nauseous, folks.
[15:55.540 --> 16:05.540]  In fact, I heard Michael Savage when he was talking about some of the cases we were covering last week with them executing the woman in DC, he said he gets dizzy.
[16:05.540 --> 16:08.540]  And that's exactly what happens to me now.
[16:08.540 --> 16:12.540]  When he said that and I saw the clip on YouTube, I'm like, that's exactly how I feel.
[16:12.540 --> 16:20.540]  When you actually care, you actually want a future, you actually study things, you're a serious person, I get nauseous and then I get dizzy.
[16:20.540 --> 16:27.540]  I guess that's the old saying of it was so incredible, he was dizzying.
[16:27.540 --> 16:34.540]  Or sometimes you see something so beautiful, so wonderful, they say it's dizzying.
[16:34.540 --> 16:44.540]  Well, let me tell you, watching America degenerate and rot in front of my eyes with maggots crawling all over it is vomitous.
[16:44.540 --> 16:53.540]  And I'm not trying to be negative here.
[16:53.540 --> 16:56.540]  But I can't stop thinking about all the serious news.
[16:56.540 --> 16:59.540]  Like my wife calls me up and goes, let's go see a movie, let's have some fun.
[16:59.540 --> 17:01.540]  And I'm just like, I can't do it.
[17:01.540 --> 17:02.540]  I just can't have fun.
[17:02.540 --> 17:04.540]  I'm sick.
[17:04.540 --> 17:06.540]  Maybe I'm the bad person.
[17:06.540 --> 17:13.540]  Maybe I shouldn't care about all this bad stuff and I should just go watch football games and not care and just let my kids eat GMO and drink fluoride water all day and just party
[17:13.540 --> 17:18.540]  and just run around, but I can't do it.
[17:18.540 --> 17:27.540]  And I'm not here trying to talk about my shelf all day, it's just that I look at what's going on and it's insane.
[17:27.540 --> 17:36.540]  I look at the raw videos of vets with their arms and legs blown off, some of them double amputees missing both legs on crutches.
[17:36.540 --> 17:43.540]  Going to the World War II memorials and the vets pulling vets with prosthesis knocking down barricades.
[17:43.540 --> 17:49.540]  I see this.
[17:49.540 --> 17:58.540]  And then I see the Democratic Party put out a fundraiser saying they're all racist white people raise money to fight the racist Tea Party.
[17:58.540 --> 18:11.540]  And I see the images of cops in UN blue uniforms riot police attacking elderly veterans with Billy clubs and now new footage has come out.
[18:11.540 --> 18:20.540]  You know, the headline in the mainstream media is documentary filmmaker claims police brutality and he has footage showing the police attacking peaceful women.
[18:20.540 --> 18:31.540]  And that's what was weird about these guys in the footage I was watching a live feeds web on info wars dot com archive from yesterday is that if you were missing legs or in a wheelchair or were women,
[18:31.540 --> 18:43.540]  they would come over and get in your face the cops would they wouldn't mess with like 25 year old veterans and people and it's that cowardly instinct to they always mess with old people or people they think are weak.
[18:43.540 --> 18:53.540]  And then there's this image of a 75 year old, you know, vet pushing the little cop back and you can look at the cop and their and their whole mannerism and the Darth Vader gloves they're wearing.
[18:53.540 --> 19:05.540]  You could tell. I mean, I bet you a million dollars. Those cops you're looking at are hardcore liberal socialist, you know, goons.
[19:05.540 --> 19:16.540]  Well, just because they're so wimpy. I mean, I just you know the type. I mean, it's just they really think the tea party are the bad guys, the real tea party, not the Republican neocon tea party that the main line Republicans are
[19:16.540 --> 19:24.540]  decrying right now. We have that. We have the new report. I'm going to break down coming up.
[19:24.540 --> 19:36.540]  We have the shutdown of the welfare cards. We have China official press agency calls for new reserve currency and New World Order.
[19:36.540 --> 19:53.540]  We've got all of this coming up today on the broadcast. But again, we salute Michael Savage for having the courage compared to the whole gallery of other cowards in the media to cover our missing news story.
[19:53.540 --> 19:59.540]  So we should let everybody else that has courage. That's all we need to turn this around.
[19:59.540 --> 20:08.540]  So you've decided to get prepared. You're not sure that a case of ramen and a couple of granola bars under your bed will cut it as long term food storage anymore.
[20:08.540 --> 20:25.540]  You're in luck at emergency essentials. We have all the resources to get you started from three day emergency bug out bags to your supplies of food and everything in between. Call emergency essentials at 800-999-1863 or visit beprepared.com.
[20:25.540 --> 20:29.540]  The choice is clear. Be unprepared or beprepared.com.

[24:10.540 --> 24:19.540]  Well, the head of the IMF is saying that the fate of the world is in the hands of the Congress and the debt increase.
[24:19.540 --> 24:35.540]  And so they'll just keep increasing and increasing and increasing until we're totally bankrupt, and then they'll have another debt increase fight and say that it's all our fault that we didn't increase it again and everything collapses.
[24:35.540 --> 24:44.540]  She says it's very, very concerning, and then Bloomberg says we may join Germany in the pantheon of defaults and then totally implode.
[24:44.540 --> 25:01.540]  They have already maneuvered us to this position. Now they're busy teaching us, just as they've done in countless other countries, that it's our fault things are collapsing because we didn't pay the debt on time, not that they created the giant debt to begin with.
[25:01.540 --> 25:10.540]  Doubling the number of people on food stamps in five years out of control spending at every level.
[25:10.540 --> 25:30.540]  And then meanwhile, computer glitch blamed for nationwide EBT system shutdown on Saturday that CBS News reporting that and they had people freaking out, panicking, leaving their carts of food, fights breaking out, all sorts of crises happening all across the United States.
[25:30.540 --> 25:36.540]  And then I believe this is all a test. They said nothing to do with the government shutdown, but they say there is a default.
[25:36.540 --> 25:48.540]  There should be eight days that the EBT cards don't work. Folks, I guarantee you within two days of the EBT not working, the looting and the burning will begin.
[25:48.540 --> 26:00.540]  The looting and the burning will begin and the military will be called out and then the president will be set to have the military on the streets and then they'll have to be a higher tax to restore confidence to bail out the banks again.
[26:00.540 --> 26:11.540]  This is how they hold you hostage. Remember, the globalists are all exempt from the taxes just like the head of the IMF is on record. She is exempt from EU taxes, but she wants to raise everybody else's.
[26:11.540 --> 26:21.540]  Here it is. Debt default could spark food stamp riots. EBT card glitch led to many riots and looting after just hours Saturday.
[26:21.540 --> 26:36.540]  Paul Joseph Watson article on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com. And the only thing holding back the looting, it always happens in the cities that don't have guns. Chicago, New York, LA, DC.
[26:36.540 --> 26:49.540]  I mean, if the EBT cards don't ever work, folks, Chicago, DC, New York are going up in flames, in flames because nobody can protect themselves.
[26:49.540 --> 26:58.540]  Here's an image from Katrina says, you loot, we shoot. The problem is the cops and military wouldn't go after the actual looters. They went to all the rich houses and robbed them.
[26:58.540 --> 27:07.540]  Oh yeah, the cops stole the diamonds, the gold, the guns, it all came out on record. They went to the richest neighborhood with the big red one from the US Army.
[27:07.540 --> 27:14.540]  And by the way, it came out on ABC News. They killed US citizens that didn't turn their guns in. That guy swept under the rug but did come out in court later.
[27:14.540 --> 27:23.540]  They murdered people that stayed in their mansions. Land of the free home of the brave, honey.
[27:23.540 --> 27:34.540]  So let's continue here. EBT card food stamp recipients ransack Walmart stores. You already know about what happened. It was zero.
[27:34.540 --> 27:38.540]  And then all of a sudden it was unlimited.
[27:38.540 --> 27:44.540]  That's what it's like to be a globalist where they just have unlimited trillions for themselves of fiat currency.
[27:44.540 --> 27:52.540]  And so all they do is create a giant fiat debt to sign us onto it to be their debtor slaves.
[27:52.540 --> 28:03.540]  But all of it's coming to an end. All of it where folks are with a magic wave of their wand going in and getting all their free EBT.
[28:03.540 --> 28:12.540]  This is life under the digital unnatural system where 50 million Americans, it's really 101 million get food assistance every week.
[28:12.540 --> 28:17.540]  But it's right at about 49 million that are on full time.
[28:17.540 --> 28:20.540]  Full time federal food stamps.
[28:20.540 --> 28:24.540]  Then there's millions of others that are on state different food assistance programs.
[28:24.540 --> 28:35.540]  It's 101 million. 101 million get food aid from federal government outnumber full time private sector workers.
[28:35.540 --> 28:40.540]  And that's the Department of Agriculture estimate that CNS news reported on. How's that sound?
[28:40.540 --> 28:43.540]  Well, that sounds like Land of the free home of the brave to me.
[28:43.540 --> 28:48.540]  And all these people are being taught a guy driving a nice car, somebody that has a nice house.
[28:48.540 --> 28:52.540]  They're rich and they stole it from you.
[28:52.540 --> 29:04.540]  They're bad. The prosperity is the reason you're so poor and only get your welfare check and your food stamps and sit in your apartment smoking dope all day watching Jerry Springer.
[29:04.540 --> 29:11.540]  And then anybody that runs the business and works hard and the lights are on at 10 o'clock at night most nights, we're the bad people.
[29:11.540 --> 29:12.540]  You understand that?
[29:12.540 --> 29:15.540]  Warren Buffett says so. We've got to have our taxes raised because we're rich.
[29:15.540 --> 29:21.540]  You make $1 more than a welfare recipient. You're a racist person who needs to have their money taken.
[29:21.540 --> 29:26.540]  Warren Buffett taught all the poor people this, all the permanent welfare classes and they believe it.
[29:26.540 --> 29:33.540]  In fact, still I see the comments on YouTube and on info wars.com and still the Democrats are saying I'm a big fat liar.
[29:33.540 --> 29:37.540]  I'm a racist. Obama cares free. I'm just jealous that they're all getting free healthcare.
[29:37.540 --> 29:40.540]  Of course, they're not. They're going to get a totally hammered, but they don't care.
[29:40.540 --> 29:43.540]  Feeling like their winners is what matters.
[29:43.540 --> 29:49.540]  That's why the permanent welfare class spins their welfare check on lottery tickets because they're idiots.
[29:49.540 --> 29:52.540]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the run.
[29:52.540 --> 30:21.540]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[33:08.540 --> 33:12.540]  It's always a tough boat because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling
[33:12.540 --> 33:15.540]  must mean that we're running up our debt.
[33:15.540 --> 33:20.540]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over 100 times, does not increase our debt.
[33:20.540 --> 33:24.540]  It does not somehow promote profit policy.
[33:24.540 --> 33:28.540]  All it does is it says, you've got to pay the bills that you've already racked up, Congress.
[33:28.540 --> 33:34.540]  Just got paid today, got me a pocket full of change.
[33:34.540 --> 33:37.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:37.540 --> 33:42.540]  Just got paid today, got me a pocket full of change.
[33:42.540 --> 33:46.540]  The United States, like every other country under globalist control,
[33:46.540 --> 33:50.540]  like Greece, like Iceland, like Weimar Germany,
[33:50.540 --> 33:54.540]  is being maneuvered towards absolute financial implosion
[33:54.540 --> 33:59.540]  and a fire sale of the assets of the country, just like Italy, just like Greece,
[33:59.540 --> 34:01.540]  just like Spain, just like Portugal.
[34:01.540 --> 34:04.540]  You notice now they're taking over first world and old world nations.
[34:04.540 --> 34:09.540]  They're done imploding South Africa and Nigeria and Brazil and Argentina.
[34:09.540 --> 34:11.540]  They are now moving in.
[34:11.540 --> 34:14.540]  They've been feeding on Japan for 15 years now.
[34:14.540 --> 34:18.540]  This is economic conquest.
[34:18.540 --> 34:20.540]  And here is the Bloomberg headline.
[34:20.540 --> 34:25.540]  U.S. may join Germany of 1933 in Pantheon of defaults.
[34:25.540 --> 34:30.540]  Reniging on its debt obligations would make the U.S. the first major western government
[34:30.540 --> 34:34.540]  default since Nazi Germany 80 years ago.
[34:34.540 --> 34:40.540]  Actually, folks, the Versailles Treaty was the reason the Nazis got in.
[34:40.540 --> 34:45.540]  They actually kind of blame the Nazis on the end of Versailles
[34:45.540 --> 34:52.540]  when the whole fact is Versailles and the unfair, unmitigatedly impossible bills
[34:52.540 --> 34:54.540]  that were impossible to pay back.
[34:54.540 --> 34:57.540]  That's what helped bring the Nazis in, was the Treaty of Versailles.
[34:57.540 --> 35:01.540]  But again, Bloomberg knows that even financial readers are ignorant
[35:01.540 --> 35:02.540]  and don't understand this.
[35:02.540 --> 35:07.540]  So they blame the default on bringing the Nazis in
[35:07.540 --> 35:11.540]  when it was the Nazis that came in and basically defaulted.
[35:11.540 --> 35:15.540]  And that's what made them such heroes to the people of Germany.
[35:15.540 --> 35:20.540]  Because it's where you take a debt that's impossible at 20, 30, 40 percent interest
[35:20.540 --> 35:28.540]  that's impossible to pay back and then get sucked dry of war reparations.
[35:28.540 --> 35:32.540]  Germany unilaterally ceased payments on long-term borrowings
[35:32.540 --> 35:36.540]  May 6, 1933, three months after Adolf Hitler was installed as chancellor.
[35:36.540 --> 35:40.540]  The default helped cement Hitler's power base following years of political instability
[35:40.540 --> 35:45.540]  as the Weimar Republic struggled with its crushing debts.
[35:45.540 --> 35:50.540]  These are generally catastrophic economic events, said Professor Eugene N. White,
[35:50.540 --> 35:53.540]  an economics historian at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
[35:53.540 --> 35:55.540]  There's no happy ending.
[35:55.540 --> 36:00.540]  The debt reparations piled into Germany, which in 1913 was the world's third,
[36:00.540 --> 36:05.540]  biggest economy, sparked the hyperinflation, borrowing, and political deadlock
[36:05.540 --> 36:07.540]  that brought the Nazis to power and the default.
[36:07.540 --> 36:09.540]  So in a way, this article's accurate.
[36:09.540 --> 36:16.540]  It shows how excessive debt, and then it goes through the horrible results of Civil War,
[36:16.540 --> 36:24.540]  the despotism that ravaged different countries in previous periods in Europe.
[36:24.540 --> 36:26.540]  So that's what's going on right now.
[36:26.540 --> 36:31.540]  And the very people that have maneuvered us into this untenable bankrupt position
[36:31.540 --> 36:34.540]  are the ones grandstanding now saying,
[36:34.540 --> 36:39.540]  give them 100 trillion in further global taxes in the next decade.
[36:39.540 --> 36:43.540]  That's the Davos' statement of three years ago.
[36:43.540 --> 36:47.540]  And they will fix the economy.
[36:47.540 --> 36:52.540]  Basically hand everything over to them, and the EBT cards will continue to operate.
[36:52.540 --> 36:56.540]  And you'll continue to be able to get your pension fund and your social security.
[36:56.540 --> 37:00.540]  And if you let them nationalize the private pension funds and tax them,
[37:00.540 --> 37:01.540]  you'll still get something.
[37:01.540 --> 37:06.540]  But if you don't give in to them and at least let them take control of even more,
[37:06.540 --> 37:08.540]  then everything will break down.
[37:08.540 --> 37:13.540]  And then you give them more power and give them more control, just like in 2008 with the debt crisis.
[37:13.540 --> 37:19.540]  And then five, six years later, you're at the next step of impoverishment.
[37:19.540 --> 37:21.540]  This is the program.
[37:21.540 --> 37:22.540]  This is the plan.
[37:22.540 --> 37:27.540]  And the globalists are using China to hedge their bets with the billion 300 million slaves
[37:27.540 --> 37:32.540]  and the Foxcom Apple slave factories and suicide nets and rivers that are so toxic
[37:32.540 --> 37:37.540]  they catch on fire and giant power plants being built everywhere as our clean plants are being shut down.
[37:37.540 --> 37:41.540]  The globalists have moved everything there to leverage out their competition here.
[37:41.540 --> 37:47.540]  This is economic warfare backed up by armored vehicles, helicopters, drones,
[37:47.540 --> 37:55.540]  militarized police domestically to make sure we go into this collectivization quietly.
[37:55.540 --> 37:59.540]  And so Homeland Security demonizes the gun owners, the veterans, the returning veterans,
[37:59.540 --> 38:05.540]  the libertarians, the constitutionalists, because we're what's left.
[38:05.540 --> 38:06.540]  We understand what's happening.
[38:06.540 --> 38:10.540]  We're the opposition to this takeover.
[38:10.540 --> 38:17.540]  And if we get the word out, we'll be like Iceland and Ireland to a certain extent that say,
[38:17.540 --> 38:23.540]  you know what, 90 plus percent of this debt derivatives that aren't ours that you guys have signed us onto,
[38:23.540 --> 38:25.540]  you're holding us hostage.
[38:25.540 --> 38:29.540]  We are going to default on the debt that isn't ours that you signed us onto.
[38:29.540 --> 38:30.540]  We're going to call your bluff.
[38:30.540 --> 38:31.540]  Go ahead and implode things.
[38:31.540 --> 38:32.540]  You're going to get the blame.
[38:32.540 --> 38:35.540]  And then they back off.
[38:35.540 --> 38:37.540]  They've backed off partially in Italy.
[38:37.540 --> 38:40.540]  They've backed off in Iceland completely.
[38:40.540 --> 38:43.540]  They've backed off Switzerland would never let anybody do this in their country.
[38:43.540 --> 38:47.540]  And they're so wealthy.
[38:47.540 --> 38:53.540]  Get all they're doing is preparing for martial law on their borders as France and other countries collapse.
[38:53.540 --> 38:59.540]  And the Swiss government believes Europe, especially welfare states like Spain and France, will collapse.
[38:59.540 --> 39:06.540]  And they are now setting up troop formations in the mountains around their borders to mow down the French,
[39:06.540 --> 39:09.540]  to mow down the Italians, to mow down.
[39:09.540 --> 39:11.540]  This is in mainstream news.
[39:11.540 --> 39:17.540]  They are reinforcing and drilling for the collapse of Europe and when giant hordes of welfare zombies come in,
[39:17.540 --> 39:21.540]  demanding free goodies and demanding five months a year of vacation,
[39:21.540 --> 39:24.540]  they are preparing in Switzerland for the collapse.
[39:24.540 --> 39:33.540]  And by the way, Switzerland is basically a bunch of high IQ German and Italian and French rednecks
[39:33.540 --> 39:38.540]  that for 400 years have been breeding with each other.
[39:38.540 --> 39:44.540]  And it's more redneck than, you know, say some place like Oklahoma.
[39:44.540 --> 39:46.540]  That's basically what they are.
[39:46.540 --> 39:47.540]  They're rednecks of Europe.
[39:47.540 --> 39:52.540]  They're just bathing in money, bathing in wealth, bathing in power, bathing in machine guns,
[39:52.540 --> 39:57.540]  bathing in rocket launchers, bathing in the lowest crime rate in the world, bathing in liberty,
[39:57.540 --> 40:02.540]  bathing in healthy children, just bathing, just bathing, bathing and bathing in it.
[40:02.540 --> 40:12.540]  Well, everyone else just runs around collapsing, overrun with all sorts of corruption.
[40:12.540 --> 40:18.540]  By the way, you know we got the model to a great extent of America from the Swiss.
[40:18.540 --> 40:22.540]  Their experiment was only 100 or something years old at the time this country was founded
[40:22.540 --> 40:28.540]  and that's one of the main groups cited was the Swiss militia model where they have weapons caches
[40:28.540 --> 40:34.540]  in every town of rocket launchers, small artillery pieces, hang grenades, you name it.
[40:34.540 --> 40:39.540]  And then every member of the military, after they get out and serve their year in the military,
[40:39.540 --> 40:44.540]  they then have to have a gun for the rest of their life and they have home inspections
[40:44.540 --> 40:49.540]  to make sure that your guns are hidden so that if the government got taken over by tyrants,
[40:49.540 --> 40:51.540]  they couldn't find the guns.
[40:51.540 --> 40:56.540]  And then your default order in the cantons in the states is if the federal government ever took over
[40:56.540 --> 40:59.540]  and tried to take over the cantons, you are to resist them.
[40:59.540 --> 41:04.540]  Wow, that sounds like George Washington type behavior to me.
[41:04.540 --> 41:08.540]  And we can't have the Swiss model.
[41:08.540 --> 41:12.540]  That itself is really a Dutch model that they got rid of a long time ago.
[41:12.540 --> 41:17.540]  The Dutch had some of the most successful wealthy ports to go back 400, 500 years ago,
[41:17.540 --> 41:23.540]  but they had a problem with pirates coming in at night and demanding a bunch of booty,
[41:23.540 --> 41:27.540]  a ransom or they would burn down a bunch of ships.
[41:27.540 --> 41:31.540]  They would open fire on ships and you never knew when they were going to strike the middle of the night pulling in.
[41:31.540 --> 41:36.540]  So they said, you know, we're not going to pay your ransom.
[41:36.540 --> 41:44.540]  We're going to arm and build little private fortresses in the town paid for voluntarily by citizens
[41:44.540 --> 41:50.540]  and whoever wants to volunteer to arm in these forts and mount cannons, they will then be heavily armed.
[41:50.540 --> 41:57.540]  And that's what if that guy searched Rembrandt, he did paintings of Dutch militia, type in Rembrandt, Dutch militia,
[41:57.540 --> 42:00.540]  and it'll show the guy standing with all their weapons.
[42:00.540 --> 42:04.540]  And then they had these little, and if you go to the Netherlands, there's these little forts all over the place,
[42:04.540 --> 42:12.540]  right there by where the ship channels and things are now that are way inland because they keep reclaiming more of the sea
[42:12.540 --> 42:14.540]  and turning it to land, but all over the country.
[42:14.540 --> 42:18.540]  You could see little, little fortresses that would have a bar and a restaurant in the bottom.
[42:18.540 --> 42:22.540]  Everybody hung out the club and then you'd have people that were, there it is.
[42:22.540 --> 42:25.540]  There's some of the paintings and some of the militias.
[42:25.540 --> 42:31.540]  And so that model got picked up by the Swiss.
[42:31.540 --> 42:36.540]  But heaven forbid we be like that and that's how you have a free society where every man's armed,
[42:36.540 --> 42:41.540]  every man's trained to be a warrior, every man's independent.
[42:41.540 --> 42:48.540]  I mean, could you imagine in the U.S. if in every neighborhood there was a big locked iron box
[42:48.540 --> 42:55.540]  or in the mountains, a cave with an iron door filled with high tech, you know, grenade launchers and rocket launchers
[42:55.540 --> 42:57.540]  and everybody knew how to use them.
[42:57.540 --> 42:58.540]  And what are they training to do?
[42:58.540 --> 43:01.540]  They're training to protect their country during the collapse.
[43:01.540 --> 43:03.540]  What are we doing as the Tea Party, as the Patriots?
[43:03.540 --> 43:08.540]  We're buying guns, getting prepared, getting ready as well, just like our forebears would do.
[43:08.540 --> 43:26.540]  From the giant, sniveling, dumbed-down MTV brainwashed hordes of folks that literally think that Walmart is a field that never dies.
[43:26.540 --> 43:33.540]  Where you go and you pick the GMO food off the shelves and load it in your basket.
[43:33.540 --> 43:35.540]  People said money didn't grow on trees.
[43:35.540 --> 43:36.540]  Yeah, it does.
[43:36.540 --> 43:45.540]  And of course, they only give a small portion of the overall welfare system to the poor to keep them part of the game.
[43:45.540 --> 43:51.540]  The real welfare whores are Warren Buffett and the rest of them.
[43:51.540 --> 43:53.540]  And so now here's zero heads.
[43:53.540 --> 43:58.540]  China's official press agency calls for new reserve currency and new world order.
[43:58.540 --> 43:59.540]  That's a quote.
[43:59.540 --> 44:05.540]  And their official Communist Party Chinese release, they say it needs to be the end of the Americanized world.
[44:05.540 --> 44:06.540]  On and on and on.
[44:06.540 --> 44:09.540]  When they know full well, the globalists have moved everything over there.
[44:09.540 --> 44:13.540]  And China now dictates what comes out in our movies, what comes out on television.
[44:13.540 --> 44:15.540]  That is the Communist Party does over there.
[44:15.540 --> 44:17.540]  And they're all part of the same deal.
[44:17.540 --> 44:20.540]  And the globalists have hedged their bets to move everything to China.
[44:20.540 --> 44:22.540]  That's what the CFR openly says.
[44:22.540 --> 44:23.540]  That is the treason.
[44:23.540 --> 44:25.540]  Here's the Von Mies Institute.
[44:25.540 --> 44:28.540]  How much longer will the dollar be the reserve currency?
[44:28.540 --> 44:30.540]  It says not long.
[44:30.540 --> 44:38.540]  But again, this is all being maneuvered to where those of us that say, hey, 17 trillion is untenable.
[44:38.540 --> 44:40.540]  Now you want to go to 20 trillion in the next year.
[44:40.540 --> 44:42.540]  We got to slow this down.
[44:42.540 --> 44:43.540]  This isn't working.
[44:43.540 --> 44:46.540]  You're devaluing the currency with QE unlimited.
[44:46.540 --> 44:49.540]  The new Fed chief says he's going to speed up money printing even faster.
[44:49.540 --> 44:50.540]  This is dangerous.
[44:50.540 --> 44:52.540]  This is Weimar Republic.
[44:52.540 --> 44:56.540]  They turn around and say, no, you're Weimar Republic because you won't let us do this.
[44:56.540 --> 45:05.540]  Knowing the general public literally, literally knows everything about Kate Upton,
[45:05.540 --> 45:12.540]  knows everything about the red skin controversy, knows everything about Bob Costas,
[45:12.540 --> 45:15.540]  knows everything about how to apply makeup,
[45:15.540 --> 45:18.540]  knows everything about how to act cool in front of your buddies,
[45:18.540 --> 45:23.540]  but has no idea what QE unlimited is, has no idea what's going on.
[45:23.540 --> 45:25.540]  It runs from bad to worse.
[45:25.540 --> 45:27.540]  And I'm not trying to be negative here.
[45:27.540 --> 45:31.540]  I'm just saying we're in deep trouble because the paramilitary police,
[45:31.540 --> 45:34.540]  all they do is train to take on anybody that loves their family,
[45:34.540 --> 45:37.540]  anybody that cares about freedom, anybody that knows what's going on.
[45:37.540 --> 45:41.540]  We're the enemy in this land of crazy people,
[45:41.540 --> 45:46.540]  in this land of toddling morons.
[45:46.540 --> 45:48.540]  Washington blog has a story up on infowars.com.
[45:48.540 --> 45:51.540]  It says the US is repeatedly defaulted and it's all a bunch of hype.
[45:51.540 --> 45:52.540]  And that's true.
[45:52.540 --> 45:55.540]  Even the New York Times admits it's happened before.
[45:55.540 --> 45:58.540]  Yeah, 1933. See, that wasn't just Germany defaulting.
[45:58.540 --> 46:06.540]  That was a global default into banker control.
[46:06.540 --> 46:10.540]  Let's continue here.
[46:10.540 --> 46:15.540]  I've already covered this yesterday, but it's so historical to see thousands and thousands of vets,
[46:15.540 --> 46:19.540]  many of them with prosthesis, missing both legs, both arms, you name it,
[46:19.540 --> 46:24.540]  knocking over the barricades and to see the police attacking them
[46:24.540 --> 46:29.540]  because they dared carry the barricades in a protest down to the White House.
[46:29.540 --> 46:31.540]  And then to see the Democratic Party come out,
[46:31.540 --> 46:34.540]  I've got two different articles here and say that they're racist.
[46:34.540 --> 46:36.540]  It was a racist meeting.
[46:36.540 --> 46:39.540]  See, everything's racist. Don't turn your guns in, you're racist.
[46:39.540 --> 46:41.540]  Don't like Obamacare, you're racist.
[46:41.540 --> 46:45.540]  And this is very important because they don't want blacks, Hispanics and Asians
[46:45.540 --> 46:52.540]  to ever feel like they could come out and protest against their memorials being shut down.
[46:52.540 --> 46:56.540]  It makes it, even if it isn't true, it makes it that way.
[46:56.540 --> 47:00.540]  I can't tell you how many black folks I've seen on the news or listened to on talk radio
[47:00.540 --> 47:03.540]  who say, well, I've come out to a Tea Party event, a pro-second amendment event,
[47:03.540 --> 47:05.540]  but you know, I heard it's all racist.
[47:05.540 --> 47:12.540]  And even if they know it's not true, they still say, I feel uncomfortable.
[47:12.540 --> 47:15.540]  So this is the type of stuff that's going on.
[47:15.540 --> 47:21.540]  This is the total divide and conquer that is happening.
[47:21.540 --> 47:25.540]  So they can steal all of our birthrights while playing us off against each other.
[47:25.540 --> 47:26.540]  But here it is.
[47:26.540 --> 47:29.540]  Riot police use force against elderly vets outside White House.
[47:29.540 --> 47:30.540]  Incredible footage.
[47:30.540 --> 47:32.540]  Kit Daniels has it.
[47:32.540 --> 47:36.540]  CNN mocks million vet march as Tea Party crazies.
[47:36.540 --> 47:46.540]  Makes fun of World War Two vets, you name it.
[47:46.540 --> 47:53.540]  Naturally, the DCCC Democratic fundraising group shows one guy with a Confederate flag
[47:53.540 --> 47:59.540]  and says million vets march racist ignores all the images of people with their prosthesis legs
[47:59.540 --> 48:00.540]  out there demonstrating.
[48:00.540 --> 48:03.540]  And as if a rebel flag is even bad.
[48:03.540 --> 48:08.540]  Those people, that means I'm sick of hearing being from the South is bad.
[48:08.540 --> 48:12.540]  That's what it means, folks, heritage.
[48:12.540 --> 48:13.540]  But it doesn't matter.
[48:13.540 --> 48:17.540]  They just use that over and over again like nothing else matters.
[48:17.540 --> 48:21.540]  Of course, how many times have we caught the Democrats going out with racist signs
[48:21.540 --> 48:25.540]  at Trayvon Martin events, turns out the Democratic Party operatives saying,
[48:25.540 --> 48:29.540]  you know, I hate black people holding a sign up and turns out they're a Democratic Party
[48:29.540 --> 48:31.540]  operative like in Houston.
[48:31.540 --> 48:35.540]  People are in overalls with a hay seed in their mouth literally saying,
[48:35.540 --> 48:37.540]  I don't like blacks and Mexicans.
[48:37.540 --> 48:39.540]  I love Rand Paul.
[48:39.540 --> 48:42.540]  And of course, they'll probably take that clip out of context and say I just said that
[48:42.540 --> 48:46.540]  when I'm quoting their operative that actually got caught when Rand Paul was running for
[48:46.540 --> 48:47.540]  Senate.
[48:47.540 --> 48:48.540]  This is what they do.
[48:48.540 --> 48:50.540]  Praying on their constituents.
[48:50.540 --> 48:54.540]  Praying on them.
[48:54.540 --> 48:56.540]  Here's the examiner article.
[48:56.540 --> 48:59.540]  Documentary filmmaker alleges police brutality at million mile march.
[48:59.540 --> 49:04.540]  If they don't allege it, you see the cops hitting men, women and elderly with batons
[49:04.540 --> 49:06.540]  on the video.
[49:06.540 --> 49:10.540]  No alleging it.
[49:10.540 --> 49:14.540]  I love how I'm not knocking this writer, but I love how there's supposed to be a journalist
[49:14.540 --> 49:16.540]  means you never come up with a point of view.
[49:16.540 --> 49:19.540]  That's pure bull.
[49:19.540 --> 49:25.540]  I mean, if you got video of say a car wreck happening, it isn't we allege there was a car wreck
[49:25.540 --> 49:30.540]  or the videographer alleges he videotaped the Concorde blowing up as it took off from
[49:30.540 --> 49:31.540]  Charles de Gaulle airport.
[49:31.540 --> 49:35.540]  There's no alleging that the Concorde took off and its engines caught on fire and it
[49:35.540 --> 49:39.540]  blew up that famous footage.
[49:39.540 --> 49:46.540]  There's no alleging the cops come up and start hitting people with their billy clubs.
[49:46.540 --> 49:54.540]  We're going to come back and after the break and get into Michael Savage and why it's so
[49:54.540 --> 50:02.540]  important that the missing nuke story be investigated because folks, our source is a good source
[50:02.540 --> 50:07.540]  known by known to us for a very long time.
[50:07.540 --> 50:12.540]  I don't want to say more than that.
[50:12.540 --> 50:14.540]  And they just said there weren't supposed to be nukes here.
[50:14.540 --> 50:15.540]  There was no paperwork.
[50:15.540 --> 50:16.540]  This is a big deal.
[50:16.540 --> 50:21.540]  The base police that are private police were seen by this individual saying I'm not going
[50:21.540 --> 50:22.540]  to sign off on this.
[50:22.540 --> 50:29.540]  The commander had to come out and tell them you let the nukes leave the head of the base,
[50:29.540 --> 50:30.540]  the general.
[50:30.540 --> 50:33.540]  The police stopped the trucks and you're going to tell me where this is going.
[50:33.540 --> 50:35.540]  And they did tell them where it was going.
[50:35.540 --> 50:39.540]  And then all these top nuke generals get fired and all this afterwards.
[50:39.540 --> 50:40.540]  That's why this is serious.
[50:40.540 --> 50:44.540]  I don't know what's going on with it, but we need answers.
[50:44.540 --> 50:48.540]  Because I don't blame people not believing us from anonymous source at the beginning,
[50:48.540 --> 50:51.540]  but look at all the stuff that's happened since then.
[50:51.540 --> 50:55.540]  Look at how they haven't ever come out and said we're making this up.
[50:55.540 --> 51:24.540]  Because folks, we have a real source who says they saw this.
[51:25.540 --> 51:51.540]  We have a real source who says they saw this.
[51:51.540 --> 52:17.540]  We have a real source who says they saw this.
[52:17.540 --> 52:20.540]  We have a real source who says they saw this.
[52:20.540 --> 52:46.540]  We have a real source who says they saw this.
[52:46.540 --> 53:12.540]  We have a real source who says they saw this.
[53:12.540 --> 53:38.540]  We have a real source who says they saw this.
[53:38.540 --> 54:00.540]  We have a real source who says they saw this.
[54:00.540 --> 54:23.540]  We have a real source who says they saw this.
[54:23.540 --> 54:49.540]  We have a real source who says they saw this.
[54:49.540 --> 54:55.540]  Every economist we've interviewed says we're destroyed financially and economically.
[54:55.540 --> 55:00.540]  If we continue down this road and we're destroyed, if we pull out and stop,
[55:00.540 --> 55:04.540]  we are now a domesticated demonic country.
[55:04.540 --> 55:06.540]  That doesn't mean everybody.
[55:06.540 --> 55:09.540]  There's a large group waking up and getting concerned.
[55:09.540 --> 55:18.540]  But half the public are self-centered childlike weirdos raised on television.
[55:18.540 --> 55:25.540]  I want to open the phones up later in the next hour to get your take on this situation
[55:25.540 --> 55:27.540]  and where you think it's all going.
[55:27.540 --> 55:31.540]  What you think of the veterans being valiant and toppling the barricades
[55:31.540 --> 55:35.540]  where the illegal aliens are allowed to demonstrate but veterans can't travel.
[55:35.540 --> 55:38.540]  And then going to the White House and the police attacking them
[55:38.540 --> 55:40.540]  but then backing off when the veterans fought back.
[55:40.540 --> 55:45.540]  All it would have took was somebody beating up really bad or shooting one of those veterans.
[55:45.540 --> 55:52.540]  I think you're going to see a civil war break out and I don't want that to happen.
[55:52.540 --> 55:58.540]  And I don't want them to start a civil war or stage a false flag and then blame it on patriots
[55:58.540 --> 56:01.540]  and then use that as an excuse for the collapse that's happening.
[56:01.540 --> 56:03.540]  The globalists are behind the collapse.
[56:03.540 --> 56:05.540]  The New World Order is behind the collapse.
[56:05.540 --> 56:07.540]  And I'll get into Michael Savage when I start the next hour
[56:07.540 --> 56:09.540]  because I don't have time to do it right now.
[56:09.540 --> 56:14.540]  But it's a big deal to have Savage in the top three talk show hosts in the country.
[56:14.540 --> 56:17.540]  Undoubtedly for political in the top two.
[56:17.540 --> 56:21.540]  Probably going to end up being the top talk show host in the country the way things are lining up.
[56:21.540 --> 56:25.540]  And to have him come out for 16 minutes and cover our missing Duke report
[56:25.540 --> 56:28.540]  he's the only other big media to cover it.
[56:28.540 --> 56:30.540]  And we're big. We're big on the internet.
[56:30.540 --> 56:36.540]  In the top 10 on talk radio about nine or so I would really estimate for terrestrial radio.
[56:36.540 --> 56:40.540]  They put us in the top 20 or so on talkers but it's more like the top 10.
[56:40.540 --> 56:43.540]  When you talk about internet total and younger audiences and global audiences
[56:43.540 --> 56:45.540]  we're as big as it gets.
[56:45.540 --> 56:47.540]  Right up there with Limbaugh anybody else.
[56:47.540 --> 56:50.540]  But when it comes to domestically just in the U.S.
[56:50.540 --> 56:53.540]  we're a third of the audience of a Michael Savage.
[56:53.540 --> 56:58.540]  A third of the audience terrestrially or probably even less of a Rush Limbaugh.
[56:58.540 --> 57:03.540]  So to have him come out and recognize wait the media is not covering us.
[57:03.540 --> 57:04.540]  They're not denying it.
[57:04.540 --> 57:08.540]  And after they said this top the top two Nuke generals and Admiral are fired
[57:08.540 --> 57:12.540]  and more generals have now been fired since he talked about it on Friday.
[57:12.540 --> 57:14.540]  Two Marine Corps generals.
[57:14.540 --> 57:16.540]  There's a purge going on. We know what happened with Benghazi.
[57:16.540 --> 57:20.540]  And I don't know what these Nukes are for but most people I trust say it's probably
[57:20.540 --> 57:24.540]  some type of nuclear blackmail like the 2007 thing.
[57:24.540 --> 57:27.540]  Which by the way we're going to play that again for people.
[57:27.540 --> 57:31.540]  Some folks I've seen emails and comments that that didn't even happen.
[57:31.540 --> 57:35.540]  Oh yeah I'm going to play CBS and CNN for you where that happened.
[57:35.540 --> 57:38.540]  Now maybe there's a reason this went on.
[57:38.540 --> 57:41.540]  Maybe something else. Maybe it was a drill. Maybe it's a test.
[57:41.540 --> 57:43.540]  Maybe my source was given this info.
[57:43.540 --> 57:45.540]  But I don't think so.
[57:45.540 --> 57:49.540]  Because they would have run with this and attacked us.
[57:49.540 --> 57:53.540]  I'm not worried. I know my source is real so they're wrong if they're wrong.
[57:53.540 --> 57:56.540]  Very credible source. Very high level.
[57:56.540 --> 57:57.540]  That's their problem.
[57:57.540 --> 58:00.540]  Anybody in real media would go with something from a source at this level.
[58:00.540 --> 58:03.540]  And I said you know they could be wrong.
[58:03.540 --> 58:05.540]  And hedge my bet up front.
[58:05.540 --> 58:07.540]  I had a responsibility to cover this by the way.
[58:07.540 --> 58:09.540]  This isn't the kind of thing you do.
[58:09.540 --> 58:12.540]  Okay. If you just care about your own skin.
[58:12.540 --> 58:15.540]  By the way if you want to support the broadcast and get incredibly high quality products.

[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:28.540]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:32.540]  Alright my friends, some stations just joined us for the next two hours.
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:37.540]  The bottom of the hour we have a guest popping in who's been censored for his second amendment.
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:42.540]  So he's now had his first amendment censored as well.
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:46.540]  Coming up in the next segment, I've mentioned it but I want to play a clip from Michael Savage's
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:51.540]  syndicated radio program Friday where he covered the missing nuke story.
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:59.540]  I want to recap as simply as I can why this is such a big deal.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:13.540]  I cannot stress enough how historical it was to have the veterans go and take over the monuments that have been blocked
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:17.540]  and to tear down the barriers.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:23.540]  Now the feds have ordered the barricades back up at the World War II Memorial.
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:29.540]  So you have to want it more, you have to continue to show up and engage in civil disobedience everywhere.
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:32.540]  Any time.
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:36.540]  Because they understand it's a war of attrition just staying on your back.
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:39.540]  They want to break your will, you have to break their will.
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.540]  This is a war, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:43.540]  You have to learn that.
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:48.540]  And I know many of you understand that.
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:59.540]  We're also going to continue to get into the economic news and the default news and take your phone calls as well today.
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:16.540]  But as I said when we come back from break, I'm going to get into the other news.
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:24.540]  Now I also have this report that just shows the direction society is going in.
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:31.540]  Texans react to fans cheering at the injury of one of the other players.
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:34.540]  And it just shows how it's all gladiatorial.
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:38.540]  In a degenerate society, you get off on others being hurt.
[01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:43.540]  You get off on other people having bad things happen to them.
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:46.540]  It's very gladiatorial. It's what the Romans did.
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:54.540]  It's one thing about boxing and that's what the sport is set to be as a test of wills and skill and straight up brawn.
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:03:07.540]  But the fact is that when you cheer the other teams mishap at something like football, it's something that before here to this point has not been acceptable.
[01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:14.540]  Not been something that was culturally seen as good sportsmanship.
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:19.540]  And even when there's the peer pressure of, hey, it's not good to act like this, people do it more and more.
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:21.540]  Because it's just like in England.
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:27.540]  20, 30 years ago they didn't have all the football hooligans and the big fights breaking out like they are now and all the degeneracy.
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:30.540]  It's part of the decline of a culture historically.
[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:40.540]  You can go back over 15, 16, 1700 years to the final collapse of the Roman Empire in 410, if you want to be technical, 1600 years ago.
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:52.540]  And the historians then were writing about the welfare class and the growing welfare class and the open borders with people coming in to be part of the welfare class.
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:04:02.540]  And the way the corrupt elites set up and the corrupt police forces and the corrupt systems and the gladiatorial events and the degeneracy of the public.
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:08.540]  The public just got soft and the sexual behavior of the Romans.
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:13.540]  And this is a cycle that again we see in every case throughout history.
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:24.540]  So when we come back, we're going to be breaking all of this down and a lot more.
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:41.540]  And as I said, taking your phone calls on the subjects that we have discussed here so far, the situation is getting dire obviously.
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:50.540]  And we don't know what type of rabbits the establishment will pull out of a hat to try to get the public to basically buy into their fraud.
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:59.540]  But the good news is every poll shows the public on average doesn't trust the system anymore and that at least is a positive thing.

[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:26.540]  On the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:35.540]  Well the international globalist banker the head of the IMF says we better take on more debt or the entire world economy will implode.
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:46.540]  She's a big globalist banker she wants that more fiat debt made up that the government signs on to that these bankers get to use and then we end up becoming their debt slaves bailing them out.
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:09:00.540]  How about we get rid of their global system how about we restore freedom how about we set up economies once again that are based on quality and based on building a good civilization.
[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:07.540]  Not a civilization based on fraud and corruption and welfare cards.
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:29.540]  Now ladies and gentlemen before I give out the toll free number and get into the latest in a chain is the latest on the global default and the veterans are moving barricades from memorials and bringing them to the White House only to be attacked by riot police and you in blue uniforms before I get to all of that.
[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:36.540]  Just recapping what's been one of the top stories for us since September 3.
[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:43.540]  Last month.
[01:09:43.540 --> 01:10:03.540]  If you go back to last month our source said that there's not supposed to be nukes at Dias Air Force Base in West Texas and just recapping people that just joined us and that these nukes were brought out of moth balls and loaded on trucks with no paperwork.
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:13.540]  And when the base police and others and the other officers said what's going on we're not going to allow this to happen the base commander came out and said no this is authorized and it rolled out.
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:19.540]  The police said where is this going and they said it's going to the East Coast it's going to South Carolina.
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:21.540]  It's going to that area.
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:27.540]  Now we come out and report that our source told us this and it's a very credible source but that they didn't know.
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:32.540]  Why it was going there but just that was highly irregular and probably illegal.
[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:38.540]  And we have the clip we're going to play first before we get to Michael Savage of CNN.
[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:43.540]  Back in 2007.
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:48.540]  Reporting.
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:11:05.540]  There was one missing nukes from Minot, North Dakota and I'm going to play this clip first so people understand this was a big deal then and at first it was oh there's a rumor there were nukes being flown down to the big Air Force Base in Louisiana and then it turned out to be a truth story.
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:11.540]  And they were going to fly to the Middle East six cruise missiles at that time.
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:20.540]  And then it came out that it indeed had happened that a bunch of people from Minot, North Dakota base that loaded the missiles mysteriously started dying.
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:32.540]  It was a big deal we never learned exactly what was being planned but ladies and gentlemen these are the most highly controlled devices out there.
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:43.540]  And we played this clip yesterday again from CNN and I want to introduce this before I get back into the news story so people understand why this is such a big deal.
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:53.540]  And why I'm fundamentally so freaked out.
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:12:03.540]  We've been reporting this and if this isn't true or if our source is wrong we need the so called dinosaur media to come out and show how we're wrong.
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.540]  We need the base to come out and deny this.
[01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:11.540]  We need the media to respond but they won't just six years ago.
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:15.540]  It was a big deal and stuff like this went on.
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:19.540]  And they won't cover it now they won't deny it now.
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:25.540]  Then you add to this the number two nuke admiral number two over all nuclear forces.
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:29.540]  It turns out was fired on September 3rd.
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:34.540]  We didn't know about it till two weeks later when it got leaked they kept it secret.
[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:41.540]  Now the number one commander general Kerry, major general.
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:45.540]  He was fired last week and AP said this had to be leaked to them.
[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:48.540]  The White House didn't want anybody knowing.
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:50.540]  It's always been public when they sack a general.
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:56.540]  There's major stuff going on and I'm not sure exactly what but my gut.
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:59.540]  I'm going to say this again I'm having trouble talking.
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:02.540]  I'm sure you're noticing this that I sound different today.
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:05.540]  It's because I'm disgusted at so many levels.
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:12.540]  There's the headline general in charge of nuclear missiles fired.
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:21.540]  Major General Michael Kerry 35 year veteran.
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:27.540]  They said because of lack of trust loss of trust by the president and him.
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:31.540]  There's a litmus test going on right now we know it's been happening with Benghazi
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:38.540]  and more where they're purging the top ranks two other Marine Corps generals.
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:43.540]  Or canned as well over the weekend and they've made up little frivolous excuses for that.
[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:48.540]  There's major stuff going on and I said back in September.
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:51.540]  I said I hope this is just a drill dummy warheads.
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:53.540]  They were testing what the base would do.
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:55.540]  I hope maybe it's just a secret transfer.
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:58.540]  They don't want the Russians to know about probably no big deal.
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:02.540]  We know their secret newt cash is Weldon Henson was at that base for years.
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:08.540]  I signed a working on B2 bombers and F16s and he said it was well known there were nukes there
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:11.540]  but it was secret since the 86 start treaty.
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:12.540]  All that is important.
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:14.540]  They said they'd have Russians in there inspecting the bombers.
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:21.540]  They had slats in them so they couldn't carry the hydrogen bombs.
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:24.540]  I was thinking this is probably not that big of a deal.
[01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:29.540]  They're always sneaking around with nukes but then all hell broke close after.
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:32.540]  Maybe it's still not a big deal but I'm telling you.
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:35.540]  You go and you do something really dangerous like this.
[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:40.540]  You go out on a limb with a source you know is credible but still incredibly dangerous.
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:44.540]  The source goes out on a limb and no one covers it a month later.
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:51.540]  We're talking a month and 11 days later except Michael Savage.
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:52.540]  And that's good.
[01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:53.540]  We're glad he covered it and very thankful.
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:58.540]  The article is up on infowars.com and principle.com where you can hear the full 16 minutes where he broke it down.
[01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:00.540]  He said yeah, the press needs to cover this.
[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:02.540]  There needs to be answers.
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:08.540]  And hopefully now they can't ignore him with 8, 9, 10 million listeners a day.
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:12.540]  Hopefully, hopefully something will come out of this.
[01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:14.540]  I mean I want them to come out and deny it.
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:21.540]  Or say you were mistaken or those were decommissioned being sent to the what is it called PanTechs.
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:27.540]  What's the giant factory close to there where they build a mandus manilum.
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:31.540]  The biggest nuke plant in the world is very close to Dias.
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:33.540]  Yeah, PanTechs.
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:35.540]  But no, none of that happened.
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:37.540]  It just gets worse from there.
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:47.540]  Lindsey Graham, that day, hours after we came out with it said in CBS News that South Carolina will be nuked in New York will if we don't attack Syria.
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:48.540]  This is why I'm freaking out.
[01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:56.540]  Let's go to the CNN clip from 6 years ago with the last missing nukes so people understand what a big deal this is.
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:58.540]  Let's tell people what we do know.
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:05.540]  It was last Thursday a B-52 bomber loaded 6 air launched cruise missiles under its wings.
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:11.540]  Took off from Minot, North Dakota, flew the length of the United States to Barksdale, Louisiana.
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:14.540]  Those missiles were supposed to be decommissioned.
[01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:15.540]  There was just one little problem.
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:23.540]  When they landed in Louisiana they found that those missiles that were supposed to be basically decommissioned and taken out of service.
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:26.540]  Each of them had a nuclear warhead on them.
[01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:31.540]  Six nuclear warheads flying the length of the United States and no one seemed to know it.
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:34.540]  To say the least, a major investigation is underway now.
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:40.540]  The Air Force officer in charge of the squadron loading the munitions relieved of duty.
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:46.540]  They took an immediate inventory of all Air Force nuclear weapons to make sure they had everything.
[01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:49.540]  They say the public was never in any danger.
[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:59.540]  The weapons were not armed, that there would have been no nuclear detonation if in some fashion the missiles had basically fallen off the wings of the airplane.
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:04.540]  But really small comfort to most of the military and to many Americans perhaps.
[01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:07.540]  This sort of thing is not supposed to happen.
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:11.540]  Nuclear weapons are the most guarded, the most secure.
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:13.540]  Yeah, that's right because it wasn't an accident.
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:14.540]  We did major investigations.
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:16.540]  It was supposed to fly out from there to the Middle East.
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:20.540]  They were going to give the nukes to somebody.
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:22.540]  They were up to a false flag.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:23.540]  Something big was going on.
[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:25.540]  We know that from our sources.
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:31.540]  Huge, huge operation that good guys inside the government blew the whistle on.
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:42.540]  Now, here's a few minutes of what Michael Savage had to say about this on Friday and the new report about missing nukes.
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:43.540]  Here it is.
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:50.540]  We're asking a simple question. Why has Obama purged the top nuclear commanders from our military?
[01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:57.540]  Vice Admiral Tim Giardina and Major General Michael Carey were thrown out over nothing.
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:01.540]  Now, there's only one site again that's talking about.
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:07.540]  It's the same site that talked about the killing of the unarmed black woman in Washington two weeks ago.
[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:14.540]  If they can kill an unarmed black woman, execute her after removing the baby from a car and then shoot it to death,
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:19.540]  without one word from the phony reverends or from the useless Provedo media,
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:22.540]  what does that tell you they can do to anybody in this country?
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:24.540]  So now they're purging the military.
[01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:28.540]  They're whacking people for no reason whatsoever.
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:35.540]  Top new commanders terminated following missing nuclear warheads report is the headline on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:37.540]  Alex Jones' website.
[01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:39.540]  He's the only one covering this.
[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:43.540]  I just found it by Anthony Guciardi.
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:45.540]  And here's what they say.
[01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:52.540]  Two of the top nuclear commanders within the United States have now been terminated following the exclusive high-level military leak
[01:18:52.540 --> 01:19:02.540]  report by Alec Jones and myself regarding the secret and unsigned nuclear weapons transfer from Dias Air Force Base to South Carolina.
[01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:10.540]  Disturbingly, the high-level suspensions from top generals within the military establishment are not the only red flags to follow the leak report.
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:12.540]  Here's a strange sentence.
[01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:19.540]  Even before it was announced that the second highest nuke commander in the U.S. was suspended on the same day of the secret nuke transfer just weeks later,
[01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:27.540]  it was Senator Lindsey Graham who went on record hours after our report and saying that a nuclear attack could come to South Carolina
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:35.540]  in the event that we did not move militarily against Syria and Iran, pushing even harder to action against both Iran and Syria.
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:37.540]  What is this?
[01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:40.540]  What has Lindsey Graham got to do with this?
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:43.540]  Lindsey Graham is a very strange, dangerous individual in my estimation.
[01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:48.540]  All right, folks, we're going to go to break and come back and you can see the full video in audio.
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:50.540]  Hear it up on infowars.com.
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:54.540]  But he really breaks it all down in 16 minutes better than I can as he can calm down.
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:56.540]  I'm having a lot of trouble with this.
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:59.540]  The point is we don't know exactly what's happening, but it's bad.
[01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:33.540]  I personally store and use their high quality products.

[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:34.540]  Here's what I'm saying if you just joined us.
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:45.540]  We have a source, very high level, that was very upset saying Mothball Nukes being reportedly taken out of here,
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:53.540]  put on trucks, connected to Special Forces Command out of Florida being sent to the East Coast,
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:58.540]  North Carolina, Georgia area.
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:04.540]  And this is very unusual, just like the Minot North Dakota Nukes situation 2007.
[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:09.540]  So we're like folks, we don't know what this means, it's a good source, very suspicious.
[01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:11.540]  We'll see what comes out of it.
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:19.540]  Then we learn two weeks later, the number two general over those nukes nationwide was canned secretly.
[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:26.540]  Number one general was canned last week, again secretly, and no one knew until Friday when AP got the leak.
[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:29.540]  Now they're canning two more Marine Corps generals.
[01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:35.540]  And loss of trust is what they're saying with General Kerry,
[01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:43.540]  Major General Kerry, the head of the entire nuclear forces.
[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:50.540]  It's definitely connected, and that's why I'm so upset is that I've had a nasty feeling about this the whole time.
[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:58.540]  And it's like the feeling of walking in front of a firing squad, basically, to be in the middle of stuff like this.
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:02.540]  I mean, my gut tells me, man, this is dangerous.
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:06.540]  And then I just look at the public dancing around like a bunch of idiots, and it makes me hate everybody.
[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:08.540]  I'm going to be honest about it.
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:10.540]  I don't like feeling like this.
[01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:16.540]  I don't like it.
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:24.540]  I mean, it's like Rome with a bunch of people cheering when somebody gets hurt in football and all the corruption and the EBT cards not working.
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:34.540]  It's this backdrop of people rioting for their free goods and foreign IMF and the foreign communist Chinese lecturing us when they're running our debt,
[01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:40.540]  maneuvering us towards total collision course, political correctness with Bob Koss's grandstanding over the name Redskins.
[01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:42.540]  There's some political distraction.
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:53.540]  It just goes on and on and on and on.
[01:26:53.540 --> 01:27:00.540]  You know, I've never really talked like this on air, folks, but I got to tell you, I used to halfway be embarrassed because that's just who sponsors with us,
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:09.540]  because that's the audience we have. They're smart people that know they need to be prepared in a corrupt society like this with civilization teetering on the edge
[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:16.540]  and supply chain being just in time and all the other factors that people like James Leslie Rawls and so many others have been absolutely right.
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:21.540]  I mean, I've always been like, yeah, you need some horrible food and yeah, you need to be prepared.
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:32.540]  Yeah, but that's just what, you know, our sponsors do and that's who supports us. So I guess I was kind of halfway embarrassed. I'm always, you know, having sponsors that are survival this survival that
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:39.540]  but I do it myself, but it's kind of like you're almost embarrassed with all the guns and the food and the training and I hope things don't collapse.
[01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:49.540]  I'm sure it'll be okay. This is just in case now I'm actually going and getting ready and going over things and worried about stuff and getting to know my neighbors and
[01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:58.540]  looking at how degenerate the general population is and just freaked out. I realize now it's not a chance things are going to unravel and collapse.
[01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:05.540]  So it's okay morally that I promote survivalism because my audience are survivalists who are smart people.
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:11.540]  So it's okay that we fund getting the message of liberty out by selling people high quality preparedness goods.
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:20.540]  But now I've gone from 20, 30% chance that'll ever be needed to like 95%. I don't see any way out down the road. It may be a month that may be five years.
[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:29.540]  But now I realize this country is in a train wreck and it's only going to get worse. It may get better after the wreck, but we're going through this.
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:39.540]  That's the point I'm making. And it's not some good feeling being right. It's not some good feeling knowing that my worst projections are accurate.
[01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:49.540]  It's horrible. It's like when you learn your grandpa's got bone cancer. You know, it's exactly what this feels like but beyond it.
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:29:03.540]  Our country is dying right now. And the general public is so decadent. That's why it's dying because evil can take over because people are demonic slobs now.
[01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:10.540]  Or they're poisoned by GMOs and the aspartame and the chemicals and they don't even know what's going on anymore.
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:16.540]  And they're busy working two, three jobs and they got a house full of screaming kids and everybody's overwhelmed in this modern society.
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:24.540]  We've got to focus on essentials, family and liberty and private property and God and self defense.
[01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:33.540]  We've got to stop caring about all the side issues and we've got to get together as liberty lovers and get ready because I'm telling you folks.
[01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:41.540]  I'm telling you, it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better. And you got missing nuclear weapons. Of course our reports accurate.
[01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:48.540]  I wish my source wasn't right. I've been trying to think of ways he could be wrong. It's just horrible. I mean, it's just, it's another symptom.
[01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:55.540]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Now no media is covering it. Six years ago this would be in the news.

[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:51.540]  jumping rope, and jogging saying that's not a good role model for children to show physical fitness because it's dangerous.
[01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:59.540]  Since then, that was four days ago, and you can see we broke this, and I'm not bragging, hey we broke this, hey we're hot shots,
[01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:10.540]  I'm showing you how everything we basically cover and break ends up getting picked up by the mainstream media because they don't even know how to do research now or how to even look at their precious government and understand what it's up to.
[01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:18.540]  Now Fox News is covering it, CNN, ABC News, The Daily Mail, they are all reporting on it in the last two days.
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:23.540]  That's how it works. We report on it, Daily Mail picks it up, they watch everything we do, and then it moves on.
[01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:34.540]  So there's Fox News covering today what we covered, and again, I tried to go to the Heiken Bike Trail today, and it was flooding in Austin in the last few days,
[01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:45.540]  but the Heiken Bike Trail has got to be hundreds of square miles, I mean it's just gigantic, like half the city is green belt and off limits to housing, it's huge.
[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:55.540]  So I pull up at one of the points I jog down into and go for a run, the Barton Creek is way down there, not even out of its banks now, they got police tape up,
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:35:05.540]  I'm walking up to go in and a woman walks up, getting in her car, and she comes out of her way to get out of her car, walk up and I'd say, friendly, hey you can't go in there, it's closed, she walks over and she goes,
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:17.540]  it's closed, you're not supposed to go in there, and they had like police tape up, and I said, yeah I know, I live by Barton Creek, I know that it's back down to normal levels now,
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:28.540]  I'm going for a jog, there's all these trails that are a mile away from the creek, and she gets real mad and stomps off, I come back up 30 minutes later after a jog,
[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:36.540]  and a listener comes jogging by, because he said he was a listener, and he goes, you better watch out, they were just here giving people tickets,
[01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:44.540]  and I went, really, let me get that on tape, so I got him saying that on tape, and he goes, yeah, they were just here, you better get off the street,
[01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:53.540]  of course I was leaving, and I have a good feeling that she called the police, now imagine folks, you've got, if you look at a satellite map of Austin Texas,
[01:35:53.540 --> 01:36:04.540]  you'll see giant areas that are green through the city, I mean it's got to be hundreds of square miles, going out into Hays County, out of Travis County,
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:14.540]  giant areas, I mean you can hike 20 miles on the green belt easily in any direction basically, it's unbelievable,
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:22.540]  and so I went down to the creek and shot video of it, and it was barely even rushing anymore, and used to they didn't close it,
[01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:27.540]  because it's dangerous though, no one can go on the 100 plus square miles or whatever it is,
[01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:36.540]  guys look up estimates of green belts in Austin Texas, the square mileage of these babies, some of the biggest in the country is the point,
[01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:42.540]  and now you go down there and they've got these rangers down there constantly giving people tickets and all the rest of it,
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:50.540]  some days you go down there you'll see more rangers than you see people, they had falling rocks off one cliff,
[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:57.540]  so they didn't just close right around the rocks, they closed miles of trail a few years ago because of falling rocks,
[01:36:57.540 --> 01:37:04.540]  you just can't even go into there because there's some cliffs and a rock fell on somebody, and there it is, the Barton Creek green belt,
[01:37:04.540 --> 01:37:14.540]  that's just one part of it, how many square miles does it say it is, yeah that's 7.25 mile, that's just one of the trails,
[01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:20.540]  but I'm talking about the square miles total of it, it's just massive, massive, massive, massive area,
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:24.540]  and that's about how it was flowing if you're watching us on TV, that's about what it looks like right now,
[01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:32.540]  it was way out of its banks yesterday, the point is though that they shut the whole thing down,
[01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:39.540]  and it's the nanny state because well you can't get near rushing water, well I can get near a pedestrian street,
[01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:45.540]  and I can be hit by a car, that kills tens of thousands a year, it's this idea, well you can't bring a football to school anymore,
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:51.540]  you can't bring a soccer ball, that's dangerous, you've got to wear a helmet to play soccer now, it's a total system of control,
[01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:58.540]  and the fact is the foreign banks are looting us, we're having our rights stolen, our freedom stolen,
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:10.540]  and they've got time to have park police in the misting rain running around giving people tickets,
[01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:16.540]  yeah blow that up, back out of that for people to give an idea how big it is, just zoom out and show a satellite shot of the entire city of Austin,
[01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:26.540]  look at how big that green belt is, do you see it right there folks, it starts there but then it runs all the way out of town,
[01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:31.540]  okay, now imagine I randomly pull up in some neighborhood to go into one of the entrances,
[01:38:31.540 --> 01:38:38.540]  and they've got police up there giving people tickets trying to go in, going into that,
[01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:43.540]  now look at the creek in the middle, if you're a TV viewer or a watcher, that's the creek,
[01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:50.540]  now imagine a mile off the creek, I want to go for a run, nothing to do with the creek, I went down there because it was forbidden of course,
[01:38:50.540 --> 01:39:00.540]  just to see this great evil, so there's the nanny state, hey if you're a foreign bank you want to steal $47 trillion,
[01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:08.540]  that's a okay, if you want to do stuff like that it's okay, if you want to put cancer viruses in the vaccines, that's a okay,
[01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:21.540]  but if you want to come out with a USPS pro sports, let's move stamps that show kids jumping rope and kids playing football and kids playing tennis,
[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:31.540]  uh-uh, it's banned, and to me that was sensational when Julie Wilson wrote about that last Thursday, sensational,
[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:40.540]  and it is sensational, but why is it usually infowars.com that is shocked by something like that to initiate people having outrage,
[01:39:40.540 --> 01:39:46.540]  that's what's freaking me out, we have from my source, my source is telling the truth that they believe,
[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:51.540]  they were told they were real nuclear weapons that were secretly at the base, being shipped out without proper paperwork,
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:58.540]  and the police freaked out in front of them as well, everybody freaked out, just like when Nuke showed up from Minot, North Dakota,
[01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:04.540]  at Marksdale Air Force Base six years ago, everybody freaked out, it got stopped that time, this time it didn't get stopped,
[01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:11.540]  the Nuke's disappeared on down the road, maybe the source is wrong that they were Nuke's, I mean I'm hoping this is wrong,
[01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:18.540]  but no one cares, because did you hear the Washington Red Skin name is racist, and did you hear the Second Amendment's racist,
[01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:24.540]  and did you hear Obamacare works wonderfully, and if you don't like it, you're a racist, and did you hear the veterans that had their arms and legs blown off,
[01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:32.540]  pulling down the barricades, the Democratic Party put out press releases saying they're racist, so it doesn't matter,
[01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:38.540]  one of the Nuke's goes off, and you don't like being blown up by it, you're racist, having any concern is racist,
[01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:45.540]  we're joined by Brian Adkin, so I wanted to get on the nightly news, what we scheduled him here on the radio,
[01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:56.540]  so it's great to have him, he's going to pop in briefly with us, bannedbykickstarter.com, I thought Brian Adkin's story was important,
[01:40:56.540 --> 01:41:03.540]  because this is happening to a lot of people, if it's pro free speech, or pro Second Amendment, or pro states rights,
[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:08.540]  they don't let you have a Kickstarter campaign, he was going to do a Kickstarter campaign to write a book,
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:15.540]  and the control of crowd sourcing and charity and things like this and political money giving is key,
[01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:23.540]  it's okay for the University of Texas to send out letters to all their alumni saying give your estate to us when you die,
[01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:30.540]  it's okay for the socialists in the ADL and Southern Prairie Law Center to go out and beg for money from all the professionals in the country,
[01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:39.540]  to set up anti free speech groups, but if I, God forbid, ever try to raise money, or have a money bomb, it's the worst thing since Satan,
[01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:48.540]  and he's got a bunch of examples of where they let socialist, communist, anti freedom groups raise money for political action,
[01:41:48.540 --> 01:41:54.540]  but he wrote a book about people with legal guns having their guns taken, that happens all the time,
[01:41:54.540 --> 01:42:00.540]  neighbor doesn't like that dear rifle they saw, cops still come and say well, the neighbor was scared, we're taking it to jail,
[01:42:00.540 --> 01:42:04.540]  you see it in the news all the time, he wrote a book about it, he was going to raise money to publish it,
[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:13.540]  and Kickstarter came in and said no, we're going to selectively not let you, just like Google, people say well why use Google Store,
[01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:18.540]  because that's where the market is, you go to the big store to then reach people and wake them up,
[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:24.540]  it's the equivalent of brick and mortar, and just like black people weren't allowed to go in and eat at the lunch counter,
[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:29.540]  back in the 50s and early 60s and they had to go say yes I want to eat there, oh go eat somewhere else, well there is no where for me to eat,
[01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:35.540]  well you shouldn't be upset you can't eat at this lunch counter, I can't sell the Obama deception on Google,
[01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:42.540]  they officially told us we deem this racist, nothing to do with Obama's mixed heritage, nothing to do with him being black or white,
[01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:48.540]  nothing about that in the film, it's actually about how they want to go in and use Obama as the front to take over Africa
[01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:54.540]  and commit genocide, which now is actually started, and there's a story from that five, six years ago when the film came out,
[01:42:54.540 --> 01:43:01.540]  you can pull it up, Google Store bans Obama deception, and they told us this is a racist movie, by the way,
[01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:10.540]  we submitted the Obama deception to Apple iTunes and they refused it and said it was racist, and we're so busy we never even did a report on that,
[01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:19.540]  so I live under the discrimination of oh, Fox News, Fox Sports says it's racist, the NRA is racist,
[01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:24.540]  it doesn't matter if it was founded to train northerners how to shoot after civil war, mainly black freed slaves,
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:30.540]  so they can protect themselves, that's on record historically, doesn't matter, just say they're the Klan, they're the opposite of the Klan,
[01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:36.540]  just say they are, doesn't matter the Obama deception, nothing to do with race, and they want to change the, I'm banned,
[01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:47.540]  now they found the article where Google deleted Obama deception one time, and no, it's Google Store banned sale of Obama deception,
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:54.540]  that's the headline from almost six years ago, the point is, is I'm going to go to our guest to talk about this,
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:44:00.540]  people say oh, don't be on Kickstarter then, and then YouTube censors people, when they say there are commons and you follow their rules,
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:06.540]  you can be there and you built YouTube, and then they selectively enforce, no, this is what the Nazis did,
[01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:13.540]  with color of law shutting down businesses of people they didn't like at first, and then it led to other things later,
[01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:19.540]  this is how they operate, this is the tyranny of like sending the IRS up for tea party, and after pro-life groups,
[01:44:19.540 --> 01:44:26.540]  and after the press, even AP last week had four articles saying there's a war on the press, and that Obama's very dangerous, good,
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:33.540]  people better get that folks, we're all in danger, we either have courage, speak out against it, or it's all over,
[01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:38.540]  so bannedbykickstarter.com, Brian Adkin, or is it Aiken, how do I pronounce that?
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:39.540]  It's Aiken, yeah.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:46.540]  All right, good to have you on with us, you got great video Skype buddy, so break down what happened to you,
[01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:52.540]  because if we don't stand up for you, we're all going to lose the great power of crowdsourcing,
[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:59.540]  they only want to use crowdsourcing and idea crowdsourcing for their operations, again, they're authoritarian pigs.
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:08.540]  You're probably right, so I started a campaign on Kickstarter, and it was just for publishing my book,
[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:18.540]  it wasn't for anything else, and they decided that my project was trying to raise awareness,
[01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:24.540]  and because it was trying to raise awareness that they weren't going to let me do a project at all,
[01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:30.540]  and they have campaigns all over Kickstarter, that in its very title has the words,
[01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:37.540]  we're trying to raise awareness for one thing or another, and within my entire project, I didn't use those words once,
[01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:43.540]  but I included a quote that said, the title of my project was,
[01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:48.540]  it's dangerous to be right when the government is wrong, and this is my book project,
[01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:55.540]  and all it was, was I need funding for publishing and distribution and marketing, and to get this book out there,
[01:45:55.540 --> 01:46:04.540]  and they banned it, I appealed, and I said, you know, I meet all of the guidelines on your guidelines page,
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:09.540]  nowhere on your guidelines page does it say that a book can't raise awareness,
[01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:17.540]  and even if that is a policy, nowhere in my project am I saying that I'm trying to raise awareness,
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:22.540]  but of course, you know, that's what Kickstarter exists for, to raise awareness, to raise funds,
[01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:26.540]  that's a proud funding site, of course you're trying to raise awareness for one thing or another,
[01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:35.540]  but they ultimately denied my appeal, and I had to go to Indiegogo, which is successfully, you know,
[01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:40.540]  becoming kind of like a backup for Kickstarter in many cases, people who find themselves in a position like I do.
[01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:45.540]  And you've now raised your goal, you wanted 20,000, you now raised 23,000.
[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:46.540]  That's right, yeah.
[01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:52.540]  So they failed in censoring you, and I think people should understand Indiegogo has not censored you yet,
[01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:56.540]  and so I guess that's how the free market works, they're the place to go.
[01:46:56.540 --> 01:47:05.540]  You know, and as soon as I just tweeted out about 15 minutes ago, that I was about to be on your show to talk about how Kickstarter banned me,
[01:47:05.540 --> 01:47:10.540]  and Indiegogo followed me on Twitter, and you know, we're talking about my project.
[01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:16.540]  So I think Indiegogo is a great venue for people to go to if they care about freedom and don't want to have to deal with,
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:20.540]  you know, giving a portion of the money they raised to companies like Kickstarter.
[01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:25.540]  Now let's talk about what this thought crime book would have been about of you to raise the money there,
[01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:27.540]  because this is a way to pre-ban a book.
[01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:31.540]  It's like aborting a baby before they even get conceived via a time machine.
[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:36.540]  It's like the Terminator going back to try to kill Sarah Connor.
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:37.540]  It is.
[01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:40.540]  Well, it was about my personal experiences.
[01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:45.540]  Back in 2009, I was arrested for legally owning guns in the state of New Jersey,
[01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:53.540]  and I went through a complete Mickey Mouse trial where a judge forced a jury to find me guilty,
[01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:56.540]  even though they didn't want to convict me.
[01:47:56.540 --> 01:48:00.540]  They didn't want to, and they're on record for doing that.
[01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:02.540]  And eventually the governor released me from prison.
[01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:06.540]  I was sentenced to seven years for legally owning firearms,
[01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:11.540]  and I've spent four months of that term in prison.
[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:18.540]  I know what it's like to have your name and your reputation drugged through the mud by the government and,
[01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:24.540]  you know, ambassadors of the state, because it feeds some sort of agenda that they have.
[01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:30.540]  It does them good to make sure that you're somehow a bad person,
[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:32.540]  even though you do nothing wrong.
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:37.540]  And by the way, I've talked about this a lot in 18 years on air, but 20 years as a Liberty activist.
[01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:40.540]  I see it in different papers every couple days without looking,
[01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:44.540]  where they're arresting people with legal guns and they're going to jail.
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:48.540]  And the people go, oh, they can't arrest you if it's not illegal.
[01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:54.540]  And I'm like, no, explain to people briefly how they ended up, you know, throwing you in jail for legal guns.
[01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:59.540]  Well, in New Jersey, where this happened, they have an outright ban on guns.
[01:48:59.540 --> 01:49:06.540]  And the same thing for ammunition, but they have a laundry list of exemptions that make possession of firearms legal.
[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:11.540]  And one of those exemptions is transporting from one house to another.
[01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:16.540]  And the problem with that is, is that you're guilty until you prove yourself innocent.
[01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:21.540]  So you're guilty of the crime of possessing firearms until you spend thousands of dollars on a lawyer.
[01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:26.540]  You force the prosecutor to take it to trial and you have to retrieve plea deals.
[01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:32.540]  And by the time you get to trial, you spend thousands of dollars and you have to prove that you meet an exemption.
[01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:35.540]  They don't have to prove that you did anything wrong.
[01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:38.540]  They don't have to prove that there's a victim. They don't have to prove there's violence.
[01:49:38.540 --> 01:49:43.540]  How long did you serve in jail as a political prisoner? I know the case became a national news story.
[01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:49.540]  I was sentenced to seven years with a three-year mandatory minimum and I spent four months.
[01:49:49.540 --> 01:49:53.540]  And then I guess there was enough political uproar they were able to get you out of the gulag?
[01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:57.540]  They were, but it hasn't been enough for me to see my son again.
[01:49:57.540 --> 01:50:07.540]  It's been four years since a family court judge decided that fathers who lawfully own firearms are a danger to their children.
[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:10.540]  I haven't seen my son in four years because of that judge's decision.
[01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:16.540]  And this country is so free that you went to jail for legal guns on record and became a national news story.
[01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:22.540]  And then you try to go publish on a system made for people's political activism and then they ban you.
[01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:28.540]  It's just a gauntlet of tyranny. And now the TSA, the story is still on DrudgeReport.com on the left-hand side.
[01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:36.540]  This needs to become a national story where they have announcements at the TSA that if you laugh at us, we're going to arrest you.
[01:50:36.540 --> 01:50:42.540]  We're such a free country that if you laugh at the North Korean commasars, you disappear into a black hole.
[01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:47.540]  Stay there, sir. I want to come back and get some final comments from Brian Aitken straight ahead.
[01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:50.540]  Banned by Kickstarter.com, but they haven't stopped him.
[01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:55.540]  His book is going to come out, whether these authoritarian scumbags like it or not.
[01:50:55.540 --> 01:51:07.540]  I shall put that in your pipe and smoke it, dirtbags.
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:29.540]  Or visit hempusa.org today.
[01:51:56.540 --> 01:52:01.540]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:08.540]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away,
[01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:15.540]  plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments and sells for less than $30?
[01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:17.540]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:25.540]  This year, about one in every 50 U.S. homes will have a break in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:34.540]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:40.540]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:50.540]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:59.540]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:26.540]  The Democratic media calling them racist now.
[01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:27.540]  I actually have the news articles here.
[01:54:27.540 --> 01:54:29.540]  We've already gone over those.
[01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:39.540]  The missing nukes now that all these top commanders are getting removed and Marine Corps generals and the head of all nuclear forces and AP said that Obama didn't want it known.
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:40.540]  I mean, this is unprecedented.
[01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:45.540]  It looks like coup d'etat stuff going on with nuclear blackmail that's out of the chain of command.
[01:54:45.540 --> 01:54:50.540]  Because remember, the globalists can only do what they can get good people in government.
[01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:53.540]  Most military people are good men and women.
[01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:55.540]  In fact, some of the best people out there.
[01:54:55.540 --> 01:54:58.540]  Most your FBI agents are not consciously criminal.
[01:54:58.540 --> 01:55:01.540]  Even most your ATF are not consciously criminal.
[01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:03.540]  They just all believe in what they're doing.
[01:55:03.540 --> 01:55:09.540]  And so they're not going to ship a nuke somewhere under tight chain of command to blow something up and then blame it on somebody.
[01:55:09.540 --> 01:55:11.540]  Anyways, I'm going to get into that the next hour.
[01:55:11.540 --> 01:55:18.540]  The system has to lose some or redirect some that are under COG and then stage something.
[01:55:18.540 --> 01:55:20.540]  And that's what this fits into.
[01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:22.540]  This is really serious.
[01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:30.540]  800-2599-231-800-2599-231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[01:55:30.540 --> 01:55:33.540]  800-2599-231.
[01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:37.540]  Briefly, we went out and researched the very best dash cams.
[01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:45.540]  And they're hidden dash cams that fit over your rearview mirror that are HD, comes with an 8 gigabyte memory card.
[01:55:45.540 --> 01:55:50.540]  This is way more inexpensive than any other competitor because I'm very competitive, as you know.
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:57.540]  You can get it around and get shots for wildlife, out-of-control drivers, road rage, bureaucrats, police, whatever the case is.
[01:55:57.540 --> 01:56:02.540]  We have the HD car camera system at infowarstore.com on your purchase.
[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:03.540]  It supports the broadcast.
[01:56:03.540 --> 01:56:10.540]  We have the best gravity-fed filters out there, the Pro 1 system that cuts out the fluoride, the glyphosates, all of it,
[01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:16.540]  at the very lowest price with the promo code WATER10% off, the already lowest price at infowarstore.com.
[01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:23.540]  If you go to infowarstore.com, that will redirect you right to the sub-page, infowarstore.com, to infowarstore.com,
[01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:25.540]  to find the nascent iodine.
[01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:28.540]  And folks, we've compared to the other competitors.
[01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:30.540]  It tastes horrible.
[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:34.540]  It's not the real nascent atomic iodine.
[01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:40.540]  The Dr. Group and others break down at infowarstore.com in the video there, the amazing things that it's on record doing.
[01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:42.540]  And I just absolutely love it.
[01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:43.540]  It gives me so much energy.
[01:56:43.540 --> 01:56:46.540]  It's on record for what it does with the thyroid.
[01:56:46.540 --> 01:56:48.540]  infowarstore.com to learn more.
[01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:54.540]  infowarstore.com or see the video that breaks down some of the facts at infowarstore.com.
[01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:55.540]  What is Survival Shield?
[01:56:55.540 --> 01:57:02.540]  Well, it's the most amazing form of iodine that I've researched and that I've chosen for my family, infowarstore.com.
[01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:08.540]  Brian Adkin, I appreciate you coming on banned by Kickstarter.com.
[01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:12.540]  We'll get you back on the nightly news in the next few weeks to talk about your story in depth.
[01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:18.540]  But in a minute or two, we've got left other points you'd like to add about all you've been through as a political prisoner.
[01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:21.540]  Have you left New Jersey or are you still there?
[01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:28.540]  I haven't spent a single night in New Jersey since December 20th, 2010, when the governor let me out.
[01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:29.540]  Wow.
[01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:30.540]  So, I mean, that's the answer.
[01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:33.540]  Exodus, New Jersey, Exodus, California.
[01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:35.540]  I mean, it's just that they're not free countries.
[01:57:35.540 --> 01:57:38.540]  And it's not to say that I'm not still fighting there.
[01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:48.540]  I'm taking my case, the New Jersey Supreme Court, we petitioned them 16 months ago and they decided that they didn't want to hear the last point in my case,
[01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:52.540]  even though it affects hundreds of thousands of people that live in New Jersey.
[01:57:52.540 --> 01:58:02.540]  So, part of the project at bannedbykicksarter.com is funding my petition to the United States Supreme Court to get them to hear it.
[01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:07.540]  Well, Brian Adkin, what you're definitely doing is fighting tyranny and fighting them in the infowar.
[01:58:07.540 --> 01:58:10.540]  They've tried to stop your First Amendment, but you've continued to fight.
[01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:13.540]  And let me guess, you're never going to stop now.
[01:58:13.540 --> 01:58:15.540]  It's just who we are, Alex.
[01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:17.540]  And I hope you get to see your son again.
[01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:20.540]  Wow, what a wonderful country with these eugenics courts.
[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:21.540]  We didn't have them until 100 years ago.
[01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:22.540]  They're not even real courts.
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:23.540]  They are.
[01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:25.540]  The goal is custody by Christmas.
[01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:26.540]  That's what I'm done for.
[01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:27.540]  It's been too long.
[01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:28.540]  Wow.
[01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:29.540]  All right.
[01:58:29.540 --> 01:58:33.540]  Former political prisoner still has his son removed from him by the criminal state.
[01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:34.540]  Thank you so much, Brian.
[01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:37.540]  Find out more about bannedbykicksarter.com.
[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:38.540]  Thank you.
[01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:42.540]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:42.540 --> 01:59:11.540]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:14.540]  Welcome to GCNLive.com.
[02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:16.540]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:23.540]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.540 --> 02:00:26.540]  Yeah, land of the free, home of the brave.
[02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:31.540]  Brian Aitken was just on with us and legal guns in New Jersey.
[02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:33.540]  But they said that it didn't matter.
[02:00:33.540 --> 02:00:35.540]  They took him to jail, seven years in jail.
[02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:38.540]  Spent four months governor releasing because of an outcry.
[02:00:38.540 --> 02:00:40.540]  Then he tries to publish a book about it.
[02:00:40.540 --> 02:00:41.540]  Kickstarter blocks it.
[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:43.540]  States had his kid for all these years.
[02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:45.540]  That's just how America operates.
[02:00:45.540 --> 02:00:47.540]  It's so wonderfully free.
[02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:49.540]  Let's talk to Kim and Michigan.
[02:00:49.540 --> 02:00:57.540]  Remember, if you're a hardworking, God-owning, non-person, I mean, a person with no criminal record, non-criminal, you're gone.
[02:00:57.540 --> 02:00:58.540]  You're dead.
[02:00:58.540 --> 02:01:01.540]  I mean, politically, they're coming after you because they're a criminal group.
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:03.540]  Kim and Michigan, you're on the air.
[02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:04.540]  Welcome.
[02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:05.540]  Hi.
[02:01:05.540 --> 02:01:06.540]  I'm Jim.
[02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:07.540]  Hey, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:09.540]  How may I serve you today?
[02:01:09.540 --> 02:01:14.540]  I want to thank you for being a good guy to the world.
[02:01:14.540 --> 02:01:25.540]  I also want to bring up a point about the nuclear going from one coast to the other and going missing.
[02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:44.540]  My question is, have you linked the 322-12 interview he did with Lyndon LaRoux about how he warned us that the nukes were going to be deployed some way?
[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:49.540]  You know, I don't remember the full interview, but I do remember.
[02:01:49.540 --> 02:01:59.540]  I do remember Lyndon LaRoux, or I guess Lyndon Lorette, I guess what that means in French.
[02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:06.540]  On the show, we should get him back on talking about nukes and things like that.
[02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:08.540]  Specifically, what did he say?
[02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:22.540]  He warned us that if we elected Obama back into office, that he guaranteed that there would be a nuclear incident on the shores of our great land.
[02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:24.540]  Yeah, what was the date on that?
[02:02:24.540 --> 02:02:28.540]  See, folks, we cover so much incredible stuff here, I can't even get track of it.
[02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:34.540]  It's March 22nd, 2012, just before the elections.
[02:02:34.540 --> 02:02:39.540]  All right, we'll have our listeners, I'm sure, look into that and put it up on YouTube and then we'll cover it.
[02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:40.540]  Very, very bizarre.
[02:02:40.540 --> 02:02:42.540]  We should get Lyndon LaRoux on.
[02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:46.540]  That's a guy who has real sources at the highest level still.
[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:49.540]  We should get him on and find out what he thinks about this.
[02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:51.540]  Thank you so much for the call, Kim.
[02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:54.540]  All right, let's talk to Brendan in Wisconsin.
[02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:56.540]  You're on the ear, sir.
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:03:07.540]  Hey, Alex, I had a videographer working with me and we're shooting a short promo for Michael J. Murphy's next documentary on chemtrails and geoengineering.
[02:03:07.540 --> 02:03:10.540]  The videographer is a really nice guy.
[02:03:10.540 --> 02:03:14.540]  He's come around to some of the subject matter on infowars.com.
[02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:27.540]  And he said, well, but you know that part about where he was done with peers and he said, well, that's kind of racist to say that most of the murders are committed by gang members.
[02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:32.540]  And I said, in the interest of time, let's talk about that later because we've got to get this done.
[02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:33.540]  Well, no, no, no.
[02:03:33.540 --> 02:03:42.540]  Knowing the statistic that it's gang-related, Hispanic gangs, black gangs, white gangs, crime-related people shooting each other, that's a fact.
[02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:48.540]  And I did quote the FBI statistics and no, no, no, sir, knowing facts is racist.
[02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:55.540]  Vets with their arms and legs blown off protesting the memorials being shut down are now racist according to the Democratic Party.
[02:03:55.540 --> 02:03:57.540]  See, that trumps everything.
[02:03:57.540 --> 02:03:58.540]  You just say racist.
[02:03:58.540 --> 02:04:00.540]  So I tell your friend, good job.
[02:04:00.540 --> 02:04:01.540]  He's obviously right.
[02:04:01.540 --> 02:04:03.540]  I'm a very bad man.
[02:04:03.540 --> 02:04:12.540]  Absolutely. And a point made by a friend of mine that I hosted in Madison named Gil Adox, an award-winning jazz musician and author.
[02:04:12.540 --> 02:04:22.540]  And he said, PCism is now a condition of the human condition, a part of the human condition that basically breaks down your thought process, just like a computer virus.
[02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:26.540]  And you see the spinning color wheel and you can't.
[02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:27.540]  Oh, yeah.
[02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:28.540]  No, no, no, no.
[02:04:28.540 --> 02:04:29.540]  They now use it with anything they disagree with.
[02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:36.540]  My wife was having dinner with family and some cousins were there and some other folks.
[02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:42.540]  And my wife's a Christian and one of them said, I'm an atheist and Christianity, I think, is racist.
[02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:46.540]  Well, they said, I think it's racist that Hobby Lobby is closed on Sunday.
[02:04:46.540 --> 02:04:47.540]  And it's like, what does it do with race?
[02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:48.540]  And they're like, it doesn't matter.
[02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:49.540]  It's racist.
[02:04:49.540 --> 02:04:50.540]  It's like a little power word.
[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:52.540]  Racist, racist, racist, racist.
[02:04:52.540 --> 02:05:00.540]  And of course, the socio-economic controllers, the psych warfare chiefs know it's all a big joke.
[02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:01.540]  Alex Jones here.
[02:05:01.540 --> 02:05:05.540]  And I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:14.540]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:22.540]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow patriots.
[02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:30.540]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:34.540]  I personally store and use their high quality products.
[02:05:34.540 --> 02:05:38.540]  It tastes great and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.

[02:05:59.540 --> 02:06:00.540]  Ben Swan here.
[02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:01.540]  We are winning.
[02:06:01.540 --> 02:06:09.540]  Alternative media is challenging and beating mainstream media and it's imperative for the Liberty movement to continue this momentum.
[02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:16.540]  However, independent media cannot win without the support of sponsors and advertisers like Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:06:16.540 --> 02:06:22.540]  For over 26 years, Diamond Gusset has been owned by patriots with products designed for patriots.
[02:06:22.540 --> 02:06:28.540]  When I put on a pair of Diamond Gusset Jeans, I enjoy the quality, comfort, durability and style.
[02:06:28.540 --> 02:06:31.540]  Most importantly, my wife really likes them as well.
[02:06:31.540 --> 02:06:39.540]  From the cotton to the last stitch, Diamond Gusset bucks the industry standard by producing a 100% All-American product.
[02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:41.540]  Another reason for my endorsement.

[02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:44.540]  You can read Locusts on the Horizon right now on any computer, any tablet, smartphone or even online through the Amazon Cloud.
[02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:47.540]  Time is running out. The time to prepare is now.
[02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:51.540]  Your copy of Locusts on the Horizon is available immediately on Amazon.
[02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:57.540]  Or you can go to locustsonthehorizon.com. Again, that's locustsonthehorizon.com.
[02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:37.540]  I'm not in the business of thanking and groveling to other talk show hosts, but I'm also not in the business of being in competition with other talk show hosts.
[02:08:37.540 --> 02:08:41.540]  We're covering liberty issues and constitutional issues.
[02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:50.540]  But Michael Savage consistently will cover things that the other big supposed freedom oriented talk show hosts will not touch.
[02:08:50.540 --> 02:08:52.540]  Time and time again.
[02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:56.540]  I agree with him more than any of them put together, really.
[02:08:56.540 --> 02:09:01.540]  He just continually gets the deep angle on things.
[02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:11.540]  And last Friday he covered a story by Anthony Gucciardi from storyleak.com and then we carried his articles at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[02:09:11.540 --> 02:09:22.540]  Dealing with our report from Dio's Air Force Base of missing nuclear warheads loaded on trucks not properly signed for, well not signed for period, taken off the base.
[02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:25.540]  And I've already covered that at Nausium.
[02:09:25.540 --> 02:09:31.540]  But listening to Savage, 16 minutes from his show Friday that's up on infowars.com, he crystallized it.
[02:09:31.540 --> 02:09:50.540]  It's not even about the reports of the missing nukes, it's unprecedented for the president to fire the number one and number two commanders of all the nuclear forces and that then the AP was told don't cover this.
[02:09:50.540 --> 02:09:52.540]  And this had to be leaked.
[02:09:52.540 --> 02:09:56.540]  I mean normally if a top general got fired it'd be a national news story and you'd be told why.
[02:09:56.540 --> 02:10:03.540]  This is leaked that they've been fired and it turns out fired back when our story broke.
[02:10:03.540 --> 02:10:06.540]  It's definitely connected.
[02:10:06.540 --> 02:10:16.540]  And I've been here trying to break down the different angles of it but I mean Savage just really crystallizes it that there's like a coup d'etat going on and it's Obama running it.
[02:10:16.540 --> 02:10:27.540]  And you've got Lindsey Graham saying South Carolina will be nuked the night we released the info, we released it in the afternoon, that night he comes out and gives a speech.
[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:34.540]  And now we learned two weeks after that the day we broke this they fired the number two nuke commander, the admiral.
[02:10:34.540 --> 02:10:44.540]  And now they fired the number one Air Force general over all the nukes and then they fired two top Marine Corps generals over the weekend and they fired more than 10 top people after Benghazi.
[02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:46.540]  I mean they are purging things.
[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:52.540]  I mean and if you've studied history folks this is what corrupt groups do when they really are taken over.
[02:10:52.540 --> 02:11:02.540]  Because again they need to sell the country on torture, on secret arrest, on spying, on oh the police states for Al Qaeda and then they tell us oh it's for the American people now.
[02:11:02.540 --> 02:11:05.540]  And so they're busy putting all their people in.
[02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:10.540]  They need to get their people in because the average person in the government is not evil folks.
[02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:15.540]  They're just compartmentalized and are given a false reason they're doing what they're doing.
[02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:22.540]  That's why they morally can't have us out explaining what's going on because then people in the system get it and get outside their compartmentalization.
[02:11:22.540 --> 02:11:35.540]  And that's why I'm so concerned because I've never seen a confluence of so many out of control things happening and government more out of control.
[02:11:35.540 --> 02:11:42.540]  And more corruption being gotten away with from Benghazi gate to Fast and Furious to the IRS gate and the NSA gate.
[02:11:42.540 --> 02:11:49.540]  And the general corruption and the federalization of police and the Homeland Security Bank $2 million worth of targets of little kids.
[02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:56.540]  For no hesitation shooting and openly training and the Army manual saying George Washington's bad.
[02:11:56.540 --> 02:11:58.540]  I mean it's twilight zone.
[02:11:58.540 --> 02:12:01.540]  It is twilight zone.
[02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:06.540]  And a Fort Hood document you guys print that night covered it on Thursday.
[02:12:06.540 --> 02:12:09.540]  The Fort Hood memo.
[02:12:09.540 --> 02:12:17.540]  We called it it's official internal memo restricted not classified saying you don't have a second amendment.
[02:12:17.540 --> 02:12:21.540]  Don't have guns if you were in the military basically just don't take your guns off base.
[02:12:21.540 --> 02:12:22.540]  Don't go do it.
[02:12:22.540 --> 02:12:25.540]  You know it's just basically says you'll be arrested.
[02:12:25.540 --> 02:12:31.540]  Of course they don't have that legally that authority but it doesn't matter.
[02:12:31.540 --> 02:12:38.540]  We've got the fellow coming up after the break if I take some calls who got arrested walking with a son out in the middle of nowhere outside temple a combat veteran current officer in the military.
[02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:40.540]  What is in the Army.
[02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:44.540]  He's been on before he's now going to trial.
[02:12:44.540 --> 02:12:49.540]  And it's just you come to realization with the government really at the top is run by bad guys now.
[02:12:49.540 --> 02:12:51.540]  They're consciously bad.
[02:12:51.540 --> 02:13:05.540]  They don't just want control. They got a score to settle with free marketers with conservatives with libertarians with gun owners with veterans with constitutionalist in all their manuals.
[02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:12.540]  They say we're the enemy and they're going to have a war with us and they mean to have it.
[02:13:12.540 --> 02:13:16.540]  And I just want to warn the police and military and I mean I'm not warning you in some threatening way.
[02:13:16.540 --> 02:13:18.540]  I don't want this to happen.
[02:13:18.540 --> 02:13:21.540]  You're very expendable in this.
[02:13:21.540 --> 02:13:27.540]  And if they start this civil war nuke and something and blaming it on us are blowing something up the Pentagon's drilling to fight the Tea Party on record.
[02:13:27.540 --> 02:13:32.540]  That's Forbes and Washington Times and AP after we broke it of course.
[02:13:32.540 --> 02:13:33.540]  Just look it up.
[02:13:33.540 --> 02:13:35.540]  Pentagon training to fight Tea Party.
[02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:38.540]  They see that as their main enemy real Americans.
[02:13:38.540 --> 02:13:41.540]  I want to try to explain something to you folks in the government.
[02:13:41.540 --> 02:13:43.540]  This is not going to be a fun war.
[02:13:43.540 --> 02:13:45.540]  You think the Viet Cong were hard to deal with.
[02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:47.540]  People aren't going to wait in the woods for you.
[02:13:47.540 --> 02:13:52.540]  I love how in all the movies the militia fights in the woods and stuff or fights you know hiding out in the mountains.
[02:13:52.540 --> 02:13:55.540]  There'll be a lot of folks that run there who want to be left alone.
[02:13:55.540 --> 02:13:57.540]  But you're going to do a lot of people.
[02:13:57.540 --> 02:14:00.540]  Once all this really starts.
[02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:03.540]  Here's the headline how the U.S. military would crush a Tea Party rebellion.
[02:14:03.540 --> 02:14:04.540]  They're not going to.
[02:14:04.540 --> 02:14:05.540]  There's not going to be orders from headquarters.
[02:14:05.540 --> 02:14:06.540]  There's not going to be cells to stop.
[02:14:06.540 --> 02:14:07.540]  There's not going to be groups.
[02:14:07.540 --> 02:14:11.540]  You pull a patriot over lights out.
[02:14:11.540 --> 02:14:16.540]  You set a checkpoint up somebody rolls up to it is 50 something years old doesn't care what happens to him.
[02:14:16.540 --> 02:14:18.540]  Sick of it all lights out for everybody.
[02:14:18.540 --> 02:14:21.540]  And they're going to start going to bars you're in.
[02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:23.540]  They're going to start coming after you.
[02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:25.540]  These are trained killers.
[02:14:25.540 --> 02:14:27.540]  You start a fight with them.
[02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:31.540]  They're going to come after you everywhere you're at and they're going to wipe you out.
[02:14:31.540 --> 02:14:33.540]  And I don't say that with a feeling of pleasure.
[02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:35.540]  They're going to wipe us out too folks.
[02:14:35.540 --> 02:14:39.540]  The patriot leadership will be the first they come after.
[02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:42.540]  And I want to explain something everybody here.
[02:14:42.540 --> 02:14:44.540]  They plan on us all killing each other.
[02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:47.540]  It's called problem reaction solution full spectrum dominance.
[02:14:47.540 --> 02:14:50.540]  Just like they get sheites and soonies to kill each other.
[02:14:50.540 --> 02:14:51.540]  Military police.
[02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:53.540]  You're smart enough.
[02:14:53.540 --> 02:14:54.540]  You know how stuff works.
[02:14:54.540 --> 02:14:56.540]  You're smarter than general public on average.
[02:14:56.540 --> 02:14:57.540]  You know how this stuff works.
[02:14:57.540 --> 02:14:58.540]  You're not stupid.
[02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:00.540]  You do not want this civil war.
[02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:01.540]  I don't want it.
[02:15:01.540 --> 02:15:02.540]  I want prosperity.
[02:15:02.540 --> 02:15:04.540]  I want stability.
[02:15:04.540 --> 02:15:05.540]  I want freedom.
[02:15:05.540 --> 02:15:06.540]  I want a future.
[02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:11.540]  The globalist aren't going to let us have that because politically and I'm getting goosebumps right now.
[02:15:11.540 --> 02:15:13.540]  We're starting to win and take America back.
[02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:16.540]  They're not going to let us peacefully fix things.
[02:15:16.540 --> 02:15:29.540]  They're going to start a fight with us because they think long term shutting the country down, starving everybody out, having a civil war will be so horrible that two, three years into it, they'll be able to mop up resistance and take over.
[02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:36.540]  But you are totally expendable and they're planning on removing the old military and police establishment in this war.
[02:15:36.540 --> 02:15:42.540]  Now I've wargamed it, figured it out and then gone and researched and found the globalist saying it themselves.
[02:15:42.540 --> 02:15:53.540]  Let me tell you, that's really creepy when you know so much because you're so immersed in something, you know their plan and then go find it with them saying exactly what you've already envisioned.
[02:15:53.540 --> 02:16:01.540]  That's criminology right there with military science and research and Stuart Rhodes and all of his people concur.
[02:16:01.540 --> 02:16:02.540]  This is the plan.
[02:16:02.540 --> 02:16:03.540]  Okay.
[02:16:03.540 --> 02:16:05.540]  Now there's got to be a way to stop this.
[02:16:05.540 --> 02:16:06.540]  There's got to be.
[02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:08.540]  I mean, I do not believe me.
[02:16:08.540 --> 02:16:13.540]  If the civil war starts and I hear about thousands of dead cops and military, I'm not going to be happy.
[02:16:13.540 --> 02:16:15.540]  I would have failed.
[02:16:15.540 --> 02:16:16.540]  But here's the deal.
[02:16:16.540 --> 02:16:17.540]  We're not going to FEMA camps.
[02:16:17.540 --> 02:16:19.540]  You're not getting her wives and kids.
[02:16:19.540 --> 02:16:20.540]  You understand?
[02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:25.540]  And I mean, you sign on to the new allotter army and come marching down the road just like it likes in Concord.
[02:16:25.540 --> 02:16:29.540]  They said, men, we didn't come here looking for a fight.
[02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:31.540]  But if they want one, they're going to get one.
[02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:36.540]  Don't shoot unless you're fired upon, but we're not turning our guns in.
[02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:40.540]  And it all kicked off right there.
[02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:42.540]  And I'm here to tell you, folks, we're there again.
[02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:46.540]  And that's why I am.
[02:16:46.540 --> 02:16:48.540]  I've never felt like this in my life.
[02:16:48.540 --> 02:16:50.540]  I feel completely nasty.
[02:16:50.540 --> 02:16:55.540]  It's just a dirtiness of just a, oh, just, oh, no, no, no.
[02:16:55.540 --> 02:17:00.540]  The only time I felt like this is when somebody I really love has terminal cancer and you go see him in the hospital.
[02:17:00.540 --> 02:17:05.540]  And they look like a skeleton and you know, you're going to lose them.
[02:17:05.540 --> 02:17:07.540]  But it's one thing to lose old people.
[02:17:07.540 --> 02:17:09.540]  It's another thing to lose a whole country.
[02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:11.540]  And I know a lot of you have roots in this country.
[02:17:11.540 --> 02:17:15.540]  It's especially painful when you got long roots, deep roots.
[02:17:15.540 --> 02:17:21.540]  I just, it's just so sad to see what they've done to us.
[02:17:21.540 --> 02:17:23.540]  They've really wrecked us good.
[02:17:23.540 --> 02:17:25.540]  Just look what they've done to us.
[02:17:25.540 --> 02:17:27.540]  Look what they've turned us into.
[02:17:27.540 --> 02:17:31.540]  Look at how evil we are.
[02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:34.540]  And they're going to have their big commie takeover now.
[02:17:34.540 --> 02:17:36.540]  They're going to come after everybody.
[02:17:36.540 --> 02:17:38.540]  They really are.
[02:17:38.540 --> 02:17:39.540]  This is it.
[02:17:39.540 --> 02:17:40.540]  This is it.
[02:17:40.540 --> 02:17:41.540]  This is it, folks.
[02:17:41.540 --> 02:17:43.540]  These people are going to try this if they think they can.
[02:17:43.540 --> 02:17:46.540]  They've definitely got nukes outside of the control chain.
[02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:48.540]  They're definitely holding the Congress hostage.
[02:17:48.540 --> 02:17:52.540]  You know, and that's what I really think is going on here.
[02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:54.540]  Let's go to gun the fighter in California.
[02:17:54.540 --> 02:17:55.540]  You're on the air.
[02:17:55.540 --> 02:17:57.540]  Go ahead.
[02:17:57.540 --> 02:18:02.540]  Hey, first time caller only been listening to you for six to nine months.
[02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:03.540]  Welcome.
[02:18:03.540 --> 02:18:04.540]  Go ahead.
[02:18:04.540 --> 02:18:05.540]  Go ahead.
[02:18:05.540 --> 02:18:09.540]  Turned one by a friend of mine and he had a couple of decals made up for us.
[02:18:09.540 --> 02:18:10.540]  Bumper stickers.
[02:18:10.540 --> 02:18:12.540]  We got them on the back windows of our truck.
[02:18:12.540 --> 02:18:15.540]  It says, if you aren't PO, you're not paying attention.
[02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:17.540]  Infowars.com.
[02:18:17.540 --> 02:18:18.540]  That's great.
[02:18:18.540 --> 02:18:22.540]  You and I both listen to you and every time we talk to somebody on the phone,
[02:18:22.540 --> 02:18:26.540]  like when we pay a credit card bill or somebody else or doesn't matter,
[02:18:26.540 --> 02:18:27.540]  we tell them about you.
[02:18:27.540 --> 02:18:32.540]  We turn them on to you and I've gotten a lot of good response out of it.
[02:18:32.540 --> 02:18:35.540]  I have basically two questions to ask you.
[02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:37.540]  I know you're very valuable.
[02:18:37.540 --> 02:18:38.540]  No, sir.
[02:18:38.540 --> 02:18:39.540]  We appreciate you.
[02:18:39.540 --> 02:18:40.540]  What are your questions?
[02:18:40.540 --> 02:18:45.540]  I want to tell you how much we really appreciate having somebody like you and your crew.
[02:18:45.540 --> 02:18:49.540]  God, you must have the most fantastic research crew in the world working for you,
[02:18:49.540 --> 02:18:53.540]  buddy, because I'll tell you what, they're spot on and you are too.
[02:18:53.540 --> 02:18:54.540]  And we're glad that you're a Christian.
[02:18:54.540 --> 02:18:55.540]  We're Christians.
[02:18:55.540 --> 02:18:59.540]  And I, we agree with you 99 and 44 100%.
[02:18:59.540 --> 02:19:04.540]  The problem here is I think you're 100% right when you say civil war.
[02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:10.540]  One of my questions is when I get done here, you can answer for me is how long do you think
[02:19:10.540 --> 02:19:12.540]  it's going to be before we hit that point?
[02:19:12.540 --> 02:19:17.540]  The other question is how soon do you think we're going to start having banks closed down
[02:19:17.540 --> 02:19:19.540]  and do to us what Cyprus did?
[02:19:19.540 --> 02:19:25.540]  And the thing that I really want to tell you, I think I know who transported your nukes for you.
[02:19:25.540 --> 02:19:29.540]  I used to line haul across country, coast to coast, border to border.
[02:19:29.540 --> 02:19:34.540]  I worked with a largest trucking company, governmental contractor.
[02:19:34.540 --> 02:19:40.540]  They, at that time, they were called Tri-State Motor Transit out of Champa, Missouri.
[02:19:40.540 --> 02:19:45.540]  They bought out a couple of three other companies and then they changed the name to Trism.
[02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:47.540]  And they're still in business.
[02:19:47.540 --> 02:19:52.540]  And they don't move anything without paperwork, not even for the government.
[02:19:52.540 --> 02:19:56.540]  They don't work on these things. These guys haul them and I'm pretty sure they're going to do it.
[02:19:56.540 --> 02:20:00.540]  Well, thank you. God bless you. God bless you, sir. I'll try to answer your questions.
[02:20:00.540 --> 02:20:04.540]  Wi-Fi, great. You can browse the web anywhere.
[02:20:04.540 --> 02:20:07.540]  Coffee shops, airports, libraries.
[02:20:07.540 --> 02:20:11.540]  But using public Wi-Fi means that people can spy on you.
[02:20:11.540 --> 02:20:16.540]  And it's easy as, yep, they can access your data at the touch of a button.
[02:20:16.540 --> 02:20:22.540]  Seriously, even your internet service provider can see every website you ever go to.
[02:20:22.540 --> 02:20:25.540]  Private internet access has got your back.
[02:20:25.540 --> 02:20:26.540]  How?
[02:20:26.540 --> 02:20:34.540]  Well, it's kind of nerdy, but to put it simply, spies and companies that track you don't like us one bit.
[02:20:34.540 --> 02:20:38.540]  We create an encrypted tunnel so that nobody can spy on you.
[02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:44.540]  We also provide IP cloaking, which frees you from geographic restrictions when you're traveling.
[02:20:44.540 --> 02:20:49.540]  Register today and disappear online the way it was supposed to be.

[02:20:55.540 --> 02:21:18.540]  That's privateinternetaccess.com.
[02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:29.540]  That's I-N-F-I-D-E-L Body Armor dot com.
[02:21:56.540 --> 02:22:02.540]  My name is Josh. One World Way is the best in the market, hands down.
[02:22:02.540 --> 02:22:05.540]  I'm in the U.S. Navy and I live a very active lifestyle.
[02:22:05.540 --> 02:22:08.540]  Being a vegetarian, it's hard getting all the protein I need.
[02:22:08.540 --> 02:22:11.540]  I tried the vegan protein powders and I just wasn't feeling any change.
[02:22:11.540 --> 02:22:16.540]  The meathead supplement store way protein kind of worked for a bit, but it left me feeling bloated
[02:22:16.540 --> 02:22:18.540]  and my digestion seemed to slow down.
[02:22:18.540 --> 02:22:23.540]  By some divine stroke of luck, I heard a commercial of One World Way on the radio and it struck my interest.
[02:22:23.540 --> 02:22:25.540]  I have to tell you, I am so glad I got it.
[02:22:25.540 --> 02:22:28.540]  I have been taking it for a week and the results are amazing.
[02:22:28.540 --> 02:22:31.540]  I don't feel tired when I have to get up at 4.30 a.m.
[02:22:31.540 --> 02:22:33.540]  I look and feel better.
[02:22:33.540 --> 02:22:35.540]  I recover faster from my two workouts a day.
[02:22:35.540 --> 02:22:41.540]  When I don't have time to eat good food, I take it and I don't feel the urge to stuff my face for hours.
[02:22:41.540 --> 02:22:45.540]  I got up this morning and I looked the leanest I've looked since high school.
[02:22:45.540 --> 02:22:49.540]  I can go on and on. The best I can do to repay you is buy more and tell my friends.
[02:22:49.540 --> 02:22:58.540]  Call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325 or visit One World, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:07.540]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year.
[02:23:07.540 --> 02:23:09.540]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[02:23:09.540 --> 02:23:11.540]  Police call it robbery.
[02:23:11.540 --> 02:23:13.540]  We call it avoidable.
[02:23:13.540 --> 02:23:19.540]  We are fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[02:23:19.540 --> 02:23:24.540]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[02:23:24.540 --> 02:23:31.540]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[02:23:31.540 --> 02:23:39.540]  At only $29.95, fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and comes with free shipping.
[02:23:39.540 --> 02:23:46.540]  Order your fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com.
[02:23:46.540 --> 02:23:52.540]  That's 877-532-5388 or faketv.com.
[02:23:52.540 --> 02:24:17.540]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:24:17.540 --> 02:24:22.540]  The globalists think we're weak. They've domesticated half the population.
[02:24:22.540 --> 02:24:27.540]  They're down, breaking this country down.
[02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:30.540]  We're going into collectivization.
[02:24:30.540 --> 02:24:40.540]  I had the guest on last hour who became a national figure when they put him in jail for a seven-year sentence for legally owning guns in New Jersey.
[02:24:40.540 --> 02:24:47.540]  And he hadn't seen his son in four years because the state court ruled they don't care if he's been pardoned by the governor.
[02:24:47.540 --> 02:24:51.540]  He can't see his son.
[02:24:51.540 --> 02:24:56.540]  And I think about how they persecute anybody who's upright and not a criminal.
[02:24:56.540 --> 02:24:59.540]  More and more, the government has gone rogue.
[02:24:59.540 --> 02:25:03.540]  And C.J. Grisham, of course, is standing up against that.
[02:25:03.540 --> 02:25:09.540]  He's a prominent military blogger, founder, and soldier's perspective and a decorated war veteran.
[02:25:09.540 --> 02:25:17.540]  He's an Army master sergeant who, of course, was initially disarmed by members of the Temple Police Department and didn't resist him.
[02:25:17.540 --> 02:25:19.540]  And I guess they're going ahead with trying to charge him with stuff.
[02:25:19.540 --> 02:25:20.540]  It's going to court.
[02:25:20.540 --> 02:25:26.540]  He was out on a hike in the middle of nowhere with his 15-year-old boy scout's son.
[02:25:26.540 --> 02:25:29.540]  And let me tell you, we got a big piece of property out in East Texas.
[02:25:29.540 --> 02:25:35.540]  If you now walk down the side of the road from one piece of your property to the other, the cops will pull over there and ask you what you're doing.
[02:25:35.540 --> 02:25:39.540]  I mean, this country is in deep trouble.
[02:25:39.540 --> 02:25:42.540]  And a lot of folks say, hey, just don't have your guns out in public.
[02:25:42.540 --> 02:25:43.540]  Let us shut it down.
[02:25:43.540 --> 02:25:49.540]  Well, we wanted to get him on to get an update with the upcoming trial, but also talk about this memo that's restricted.
[02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:50.540]  But we got it and we called.
[02:25:50.540 --> 02:25:56.540]  And it's Command Policy SJA04 put out a month ago in September.
[02:25:56.540 --> 02:26:02.540]  Department of the Army, it says you don't go out in public with your guns.
[02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:06.540]  And basically implies it's illegal to legally have your guns.
[02:26:06.540 --> 02:26:08.540]  So they're just banning our guns by fiat.
[02:26:08.540 --> 02:26:13.540]  And CJ Grisham, good to have you back on, fellow evil thought criminal.
[02:26:13.540 --> 02:26:15.540]  Good to have you here with us.
[02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:17.540]  Thanks, Al. It's good to be here.
[02:26:17.540 --> 02:26:21.540]  So, I mean, you continue to expose this to millions of people.
[02:26:21.540 --> 02:26:24.540]  I think your video last time I checked it has like eight million views or something.
[02:26:24.540 --> 02:26:26.540]  You can correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:26:26.540 --> 02:26:28.540]  I'm going from memory, but they still don't care.
[02:26:28.540 --> 02:26:29.540]  They're proud of themselves.
[02:26:29.540 --> 02:26:31.540]  This is going to trial.
[02:26:31.540 --> 02:26:33.540]  Yeah, they refuse to drop any of the charges.
[02:26:33.540 --> 02:26:37.540]  I do still face the interference with public duties charges.
[02:26:37.540 --> 02:26:43.540]  And one of the things that we tried to do is we tried to suppress the arrest as an illegal arrest.
[02:26:43.540 --> 02:26:55.540]  And what the Temple Police Department and the Bell County prosecutors are alleging is that because I was walking down the right side of the road and violation of the transportation code,
[02:26:55.540 --> 02:26:58.540]  they had every right to arrest and disarm me.
[02:26:58.540 --> 02:27:10.540]  So, we're digging at the bottom of the barrel here as a way of trying to find ways of disarming the populace and really legitimize what it is they're doing.
[02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:15.540]  But I don't think they anticipated the kind of fight that I was willing to put up.
[02:27:15.540 --> 02:27:20.540]  Well, I've dealt with the Temple Police and a lot of them are nice and I asked a lot of my families from Temple.
[02:27:20.540 --> 02:27:23.540]  It's a great old town, but some of the police are nice.
[02:27:23.540 --> 02:27:25.540]  Others are out of control.
[02:27:25.540 --> 02:27:29.540]  I've had them tell us when they had a military checkpoint once on I-35.
[02:27:29.540 --> 02:27:31.540]  They were doing what Clinton was doing as a test.
[02:27:31.540 --> 02:27:32.540]  That's how long ago this was.
[02:27:32.540 --> 02:27:34.540]  There was violation of Posse Commentatus.
[02:27:34.540 --> 02:27:39.540]  I had the Temple Police tell us we weren't allowed to film on the highway from 200 yards away.
[02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:42.540]  So, they need to learn about the first amendment as well.
[02:27:42.540 --> 02:27:50.540]  Yeah, and one of the problems that we have here, I agree with you there are some very good Temple PD cops.
[02:27:50.540 --> 02:27:55.540]  The problem that we have right here is the prosecutors.
[02:27:55.540 --> 02:27:58.540]  The prosecutors are the ones that are causing most of the problems.
[02:27:58.540 --> 02:28:02.540]  As you know, the police obviously initiate these false arrests.
[02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:09.540]  But once they file those charges and the case, it's pretty much out of their hands to do anything.
[02:28:09.540 --> 02:28:17.540]  However, what I have a problem with is that so far the officer involved in my arrest, even though we haven't been to trial,
[02:28:17.540 --> 02:28:22.540]  it's very easy to prove that he lied on his sworn statements, his sworn affidavits of probable cause,
[02:28:22.540 --> 02:28:28.540]  because it's proven not only in my video, but in the dash cam footage that's going to come out this week during the trial,
[02:28:28.540 --> 02:28:30.540]  that he blatantly lied.
[02:28:30.540 --> 02:28:32.540]  It wasn't even a misrepresentation of the truth.
[02:28:32.540 --> 02:28:33.540]  He lied on his sworn statements.
[02:28:33.540 --> 02:28:35.540]  He lied to his supervisor.
[02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:40.540]  And yet everybody all the way up that chain from the sergeant on the scene all the way up to the chief of police,
[02:28:40.540 --> 02:28:46.540]  nobody had the gumption to do something about that.
[02:28:46.540 --> 02:28:53.540]  And at a minimum, I'm not one of those guys that agrees with paid administrative leave when a cop does something wrong.
[02:28:53.540 --> 02:28:59.540]  I think they should be charged and thrown in jail and have to bail out just like everybody else when they're accused of a crime.
[02:28:59.540 --> 02:29:05.540]  But at a bare minimum, he should have been put on administrative leave if for nothing else than falsifying documents.
[02:29:05.540 --> 02:29:08.540]  But then the problem we have is in the prosecutors here.
[02:29:08.540 --> 02:29:14.540]  The Bell County prosecutors are the ones that are anti-gun, are the ones that are going after soldiers' rights.
[02:29:14.540 --> 02:29:19.540]  They're the ones that are contacting the army and filing these complaints.
[02:29:19.540 --> 02:29:29.540]  This letter that came out from the general, and as an act to be soldier, I'm not going to necessarily directly talk about that.
[02:29:29.540 --> 02:29:30.540]  Yeah, you better not comment on that.
[02:29:30.540 --> 02:29:31.540]  You can just talk in general.
[02:29:31.540 --> 02:29:32.540]  Stay there.

[02:33:18.540 --> 02:33:31.540]  Friends, Alex Jones here back live with CJ Grisham, very popular blogger, founder of Soldiers Perspective, and we're going to get his take on a lot of issues that are taking place right now.
[02:33:31.540 --> 02:33:39.540]  He also is with and is promoting OpenCarryTexas.org, a group that we've been following and covering.
[02:33:39.540 --> 02:33:49.540]  Jakari Jackson, David Knight, and myself. We're going to be down there coming up in just a few days now in San Antonio for the OpenCarry March.
[02:33:49.540 --> 02:33:54.540]  The police chief has said he doesn't care if it's the law that you can open carrier rifle. He's going to arrest people.
[02:33:54.540 --> 02:34:00.540]  So we'll be down there and I'm told the land commissioner may even show up down there. He's saying that he's going to try to enforce the law.
[02:34:00.540 --> 02:34:04.540]  Jerry Patterson, we interviewed him last week and aired that here.
[02:34:04.540 --> 02:34:14.540]  But let me just say something. If you look at the Homeland Security documents the last five years saying George Washington's bad, gun owners are bad, returning veterans are the number one threat.
[02:34:14.540 --> 02:34:25.540]  Forget Al Qaeda now. It's the veterans. Because we have foreign globalist interests like the IMF, the Communist Chinese, and others, the Saudi Arabians particularly, now dictating our internal policy.
[02:34:25.540 --> 02:34:31.540]  This is now mainstream news. It is now like Jones saying this, reading some CFR or Davos report.
[02:34:31.540 --> 02:34:40.540]  This is now open. This is how pathetic they think we are. And I know he's an active duty master sergeant so he can't say a lot about this, but the military is massively awake.
[02:34:40.540 --> 02:34:49.540]  You know I've never been somebody that just grovels at the feet of the military because I know that can be used as propaganda by the globalist to sell their operations on the backs of the military and their heroism.
[02:34:49.540 --> 02:35:06.540]  But I have found the military, especially the army and the Marines, as the most awake group, period, 50, 60, 70 percent, Stuart Rhodes will tell you that as well, especially in special warfare, especially in the mid-level, non-commissioned officers.
[02:35:06.540 --> 02:35:13.540]  The smarter they are, the more they are. We're talking 80 percent according to Rhodes in special warfare. That's exactly what we found.
[02:35:13.540 --> 02:35:20.540]  And my issue is there's a reason for five years they've been saying returning vets to the number one enemy. Battle of Athens, 1946.
[02:35:20.540 --> 02:35:27.540]  They wouldn't let the vets vote. They were cheating things, boss hog up in Tennessee. The vets just took the town back over.
[02:35:27.540 --> 02:35:40.540]  Okay, my grandfather came back from World War II. He was involved. It ran for office as a Republican, wasn't going to put up. He was involved when civil rights, you name it, in East Texas folks, that's as south as it gets.
[02:35:40.540 --> 02:35:48.540]  Because they had already fought tyranny. They were not going to lay down to corruption. And it was World War II vets that did the civil rights movement.
[02:35:48.540 --> 02:35:59.540]  It was the Republicans that did the Civil Rights Act. The Democrats had been the Ku Klux Klan organization. They stopped being races against blacks and flipped it over to do race politics.
[02:35:59.540 --> 02:36:13.540]  You know, I'm not even a Republican because they've been so globalist and everything. The point is the Republican grassroots ideology of liberty, that idea, the Republican Party platform of Texas, sounds like something the John Birch Society wrote.
[02:36:13.540 --> 02:36:22.540]  That's good stuff. Just the leadership doesn't follow it. We could take the Republican Party over is my point. That's why they're demonizing the veterans. I'm going to shut up.
[02:36:22.540 --> 02:36:32.540]  I got you on here, CJ, talking about your trial coming up, the big deal in San Antonio, the date on that. We're going to give folks all the details on that just a few days away while time creeps up on us.
[02:36:32.540 --> 02:36:40.540]  Looks like I guess I'll be down there broadcasting live. It's going to be quite a circus. But the point is, what do you make of the demonization of veterans?
[02:36:40.540 --> 02:36:52.540]  And then now the Department of the Army that the general put out here, that the local government is now, I guess, commanding Fort Hood and telling them you keep your soldiers even off duty who live outside the base.
[02:36:52.540 --> 02:36:59.540]  They're not allowed to basically have a second amendment. I mean, I'm reading this. They're implying here. I read it last week that the second embassy legal.
[02:36:59.540 --> 02:37:10.540]  I know you can't speak to this, but you can speak to what Temple is trying to do. But before we go there, what do you make of what I just said about the bizarro world are veterans of the ones we can't trust?
[02:37:10.540 --> 02:37:14.540]  I mean, this sounds like what an enemy occupier would say.
[02:37:14.540 --> 02:37:23.540]  Yeah, well, let me correct one thing. I will tell you that the letter does not ban or in any way restrict our right to carry firearms off base.
[02:37:23.540 --> 02:37:29.540]  No, it doesn't. But I mean, I read it last week. It has a quote here where it basically implies you could be arrested.
[02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:36.540]  Yeah. Well, that's this is what I was talking about prior to the break is the prosecutors and the local police chiefs around here.
[02:37:36.540 --> 02:37:43.540]  They don't like the fact that there are soldiers and civilians that are starting to stand up and exercise their rights.
[02:37:43.540 --> 02:37:48.540]  And that's my point is they hate veterans because they know you guys led the civil rights movement.
[02:37:48.540 --> 02:37:58.540]  But but I will say that any and I'm not going to talk about any specific order, but any order that violates my fourth amendment, my fifth amendment, my sixth amendment,
[02:37:58.540 --> 02:38:01.540]  second amendment, first amendment rights is an illegal order.
[02:38:01.540 --> 02:38:07.540]  There's there's a standing mentality in this country that when you sign up for the military, you waive your rights.
[02:38:07.540 --> 02:38:09.540]  And that's just simply not true.
[02:38:09.540 --> 02:38:13.540]  I would not have signed up to join the military if I were going to just throw my rights away.
[02:38:13.540 --> 02:38:18.540]  I mean, I fight for the rights of every American, not not every other American than myself.
[02:38:18.540 --> 02:38:21.540]  And that's something that we've got to understand.
[02:38:21.540 --> 02:38:22.540]  I think a lot of people do.
[02:38:22.540 --> 02:38:26.540]  There are so many oathkeepers in the military that understand that.
[02:38:26.540 --> 02:38:37.540]  The problem is, is that the higher up you get, the only way you're going to get up there is is by recognizing what our political leaders want out of out of leaders.
[02:38:37.540 --> 02:38:46.540]  And we're, you know, we're, we don't give up those rights when I when I signed up to be a soldier as a private, you know, 19 years ago,
[02:38:46.540 --> 02:38:54.540]  I never once signed a piece of paper that said I'm giving up all my rights and I'm turning my entire life over to the military.
[02:38:54.540 --> 02:38:59.540]  I'm a soldier, but I'm a I'm a dad first, I'm a citizen first, I'm a Texan first.
[02:38:59.540 --> 02:39:07.540]  And, you know, the soldier part of me is, you know, something I do to keep my country safe.
[02:39:07.540 --> 02:39:16.540]  And, you know, any, any order that that orders me to give up those rights in my mind is an illegal order.
[02:39:16.540 --> 02:39:23.540]  And obviously that's something that each individual soldier has to weigh independently because obviously when you stand up for your rights,
[02:39:23.540 --> 02:39:28.540]  there is a little bit of backlash that you're going to get and you have to be willing to stand up.
[02:39:28.540 --> 02:39:37.540]  Well, until about 25 years ago, they gave privates because I've shown them on air those little manuals that talked about George Washington and talked about the chain of command
[02:39:37.540 --> 02:39:44.540]  and talked about not following illegal orders and what illegal orders were and then it was your duty not following illegal orders.
[02:39:44.540 --> 02:39:47.540]  I don't think that even gets taught anymore.
[02:39:47.540 --> 02:39:54.540]  It doesn't. I know, I know when I first joined, you briefly heard about it, I think it was starting to get phased out,
[02:39:54.540 --> 02:40:00.540]  but I'll tell you right now, Alex, you know, you talked to soldiers today and with this whole issue of what's going on with me,
[02:40:00.540 --> 02:40:09.540]  you know, I can't tell you how many times I've heard from not only officers, but senior, some senior NCOs about, you know, my equal pay grade
[02:40:09.540 --> 02:40:15.540]  that say, you know, if you had just been more kind or just giving him, giving him your gun when he asked for it or, you know,
[02:40:15.540 --> 02:40:18.540]  and that's the kind of mentality that is just outright wrong.
[02:40:18.540 --> 02:40:24.540]  I mean, if somebody walks into your house and says, hey, I'm going to let this platoon here stay in your house,
[02:40:24.540 --> 02:40:29.540]  are you going to give up your third amendment rights and say, yeah, yeah, you know, it's better just to say yes, no.
[02:40:29.540 --> 02:40:33.540]  So why would we do that with our second amendment or fourth amendment?
[02:40:33.540 --> 02:40:42.540]  And by telling soldiers that they're required to acquiesce to illegal searches of their papers and effects,
[02:40:42.540 --> 02:40:49.540]  which means show me your ID just because you're obeying the law and carrying a firearm in a legal and safe manner,
[02:40:49.540 --> 02:40:51.540]  which is something that we had open carry Texas do.
[02:40:51.540 --> 02:40:53.540]  We're not, we don't just want to carry guns.
[02:40:53.540 --> 02:40:55.540]  We're trying to teach people how to do so safely.
[02:40:55.540 --> 02:41:03.540]  You're trying to bring back American culture of self-defense that Switzerland is using right now.
[02:41:03.540 --> 02:41:05.540]  Absolutely.
[02:41:05.540 --> 02:41:11.540]  They're trying to kill the liberty culture of self-defense and we're trying to revive it.
[02:41:11.540 --> 02:41:17.540]  And that's what it really is, that, you know, a right that you don't exercise is a right that's so easily taken away.
[02:41:17.540 --> 02:41:21.540]  I mean, look at what's going on around the country right now with this so-called government shutdown
[02:41:21.540 --> 02:41:23.540]  and how they're closing the national parks.
[02:41:23.540 --> 02:41:27.540]  I mean, we've got a government that's telling us when we can walk through the woods or get on a kayak.
[02:41:27.540 --> 02:41:29.540]  It just doesn't make any sense.
[02:41:29.540 --> 02:41:31.540]  And I don't know how we've gotten to that point.
[02:41:31.540 --> 02:41:37.540]  It's so great to see my fellow veterans and troops and things going down there and putting the government back in its place.
[02:41:37.540 --> 02:41:40.540]  And I know that sounds weird coming from a guy who works for the government,
[02:41:40.540 --> 02:41:42.540]  but I work for the people.
[02:41:42.540 --> 02:41:46.540]  No, no, we have rogue elements that are out of control and that is what you're supposed to do when you're in the government,
[02:41:46.540 --> 02:41:50.540]  is keep it to the Bill of Rights Constitution, Declaration of Independence.
[02:41:50.540 --> 02:41:53.540]  That's the country. That's what makes us different.
[02:41:53.540 --> 02:41:56.540]  And anybody that deviates from that has to be brought back into line.
[02:41:56.540 --> 02:42:01.540]  And it's this laying down and saying, oh, we just have to follow any order we're given.
[02:42:01.540 --> 02:42:03.540]  Well, that's the creed of slaves.
[02:42:03.540 --> 02:42:07.540]  Yes, and that's what we've seen in the rise of the Warrior Cop as well.
[02:42:07.540 --> 02:42:11.540]  Is this mentality that they have this ultimate authority over us?
[02:42:11.540 --> 02:42:14.540]  And one of the things, now, this isn't our goal.
[02:42:14.540 --> 02:42:21.540]  I mean, we would love to work with police officers so that we don't have to, you know, beg and fight and scrape for our rights to be recognized.
[02:42:21.540 --> 02:42:27.540]  But, you know, by openly carrying firearms, I mean, officers, they come up to me all the time asking, hey, is that thing loaded?
[02:42:27.540 --> 02:42:30.540]  Yes, it's loaded. Is yours loaded? Well, yeah. Why is yours loaded?
[02:42:30.540 --> 02:42:32.540]  Because I'm a police officer. Okay.
[02:42:32.540 --> 02:42:34.540]  Well, I'm a citizen. What makes you any different than me?
[02:42:34.540 --> 02:42:43.540]  There's this mentality that the state, and I mean, the state in a major macro national sense and a state as in Texas,
[02:42:43.540 --> 02:42:49.540]  when the state feels like they have more power than you can have, and it's just a common statement.
[02:42:49.540 --> 02:42:53.540]  I mean, he doesn't even think twice about saying, well, I'm a police officer.
[02:42:53.540 --> 02:42:57.540]  As if that somehow puts him above me as far as what rights I can decide.
[02:42:57.540 --> 02:42:59.540]  They want the monopoly of force.
[02:42:59.540 --> 02:43:04.540]  We don't want to live in the worst areas of Chicago or New York or DC.
[02:43:04.540 --> 02:43:06.540]  We live here because we want to be free.
[02:43:06.540 --> 02:43:14.540]  But the Democrats say they're going to turn the state blue and that they will get our guns and they will bring in enough illegals to get the vote done.
[02:43:14.540 --> 02:43:19.540]  You know, they might turn the state blue. I mean, you know, they could possibly do that.
[02:43:19.540 --> 02:43:22.540]  It's done before. Look what happened to Ann Richards.
[02:43:22.540 --> 02:43:25.540]  But there's no way they're taking Texas's guns.
[02:43:25.540 --> 02:43:28.540]  I know, but that's their goal. That shows how bold they are.
[02:43:28.540 --> 02:43:29.540]  That is their goal.
[02:43:29.540 --> 02:43:39.540]  And I'll tell you, since we started OCT, I mean, the open carry Texas organization, we've gotten, we've woken a lot of people up, including the gun grabber groups.
[02:43:39.540 --> 02:43:48.540]  And Texas is now in the crosshairs for things like mom's demand action and mayors for gun control or whatever that Bloomberg organization is called.
[02:43:48.540 --> 02:44:02.540]  So we're, but you know what? We're going to approve on October 19 next Saturday as we bring over a thousand armed patriots to the Alamo and we draw that line in the sand that, you know, we are not going to accept anyone taking our guns.
[02:44:02.540 --> 02:44:04.540]  We're going to do so peacefully.
[02:44:04.540 --> 02:44:12.540]  But, you know, it seems Alex at some point, we've got to stop just be just being allowing ourselves to get arrested at some point.
[02:44:12.540 --> 02:44:21.540]  We've got to stop allowing, you know, our rights to be infringed and then we fight it in the courts and start standing up for ourselves right there at the moment.
[02:44:21.540 --> 02:44:26.540]  And I don't think that time's anywhere close, but it's closer than it's ever been in history.
[02:44:26.540 --> 02:44:30.540]  Well, we've got to let the tyrants know we're not backing down.
[02:44:30.540 --> 02:44:34.540]  That's the only way we can avert the total takeover we're seeing.
[02:44:34.540 --> 02:44:46.540]  Talk about what time people should be there, give people a lay of the land, what's going to be happening, the fact that it's totally legal to have long guns, not handguns, folks, because Texas isn't as free as we thought it was.
[02:44:46.540 --> 02:44:50.540]  There's only five other states that have laws this anti gun.
[02:44:50.540 --> 02:44:52.540]  Tell folks about that.
[02:44:52.540 --> 02:44:56.540]  Yeah, the event starts on Saturday at 10 o'clock at the Alamo.
[02:44:56.540 --> 02:45:04.540]  There's plenty of parking all around the place. Now, what you'll know is San Antonio did have an ordinance against the carrying of loaded firearms within city limits.
[02:45:04.540 --> 02:45:10.540]  We have successfully worked, the San Antonio Police Department was very anti gun.
[02:45:10.540 --> 02:45:12.540]  We shamed them into submission.
[02:45:12.540 --> 02:45:18.540]  They, they, we've had many open carry walks around the city in preparation for this event coming up.
[02:45:18.540 --> 02:45:23.540]  The San Antonio Police Department has actually been very respectful of that.
[02:45:23.540 --> 02:45:27.540]  They haven't bothered our people. They've come up and had normal conversations.
[02:45:27.540 --> 02:45:29.540]  No one's been forced to ID.
[02:45:29.540 --> 02:45:31.540]  So 10 o'clock on Saturday at the Alamo.
[02:45:31.540 --> 02:45:33.540]  Bring your long arms.
[02:45:33.540 --> 02:45:37.540]  That means you can lawfully carry a rifle, any rifle, any shotgun.
[02:45:37.540 --> 02:45:49.540]  And you can also, if you want to carry a pistol, if you've got an 1899 or prior handgun, you can carry that openly as well or a replica as long as it doesn't fire center fire or rimfire ammunition.
[02:45:49.540 --> 02:46:07.540]  So we're going to have a over a thousand people so far as what we've got coming down to the city of Alamo or the city of San Antonio at the Alamo to basically educate the public and educate law enforcement and our state that we are not going to allow our gun rights to be disrespected.
[02:46:07.540 --> 02:46:10.540]  We're not going to allow them our rights to be infringed upon.
[02:46:10.540 --> 02:46:21.540]  And this is the equivalent of Charlton Heston in Oklahoma and Alabama going in with black folks and eating at the counter and being there when folks got arrested.
[02:46:21.540 --> 02:46:24.540]  Rosa Parks sitting at the front of the bus.
[02:46:24.540 --> 02:46:29.540]  If we have this right, but they want to threaten to arrest us because we have it, it shows what tyrants they are.
[02:46:29.540 --> 02:46:39.540]  And I guess things have changed since last week because when we talked to the land commissioner, Jerry Patterson, who's been a great patriot, I've known him for more than 15 years.
[02:46:39.540 --> 02:46:42.540]  He said that, well, yeah, they've been threatened to arrest people.
[02:46:42.540 --> 02:46:45.540]  The police chief has, but I've explained this is state property.
[02:46:45.540 --> 02:46:49.540]  So even if they have a fake ordinance, they can't stop you from having the guns on the state property.
[02:46:49.540 --> 02:46:56.540]  And I've given an order to the daughters of Republic of Texas and the state police that are going to be there, reminding them this is legal and lawful.
[02:46:56.540 --> 02:47:03.540]  So, so, I mean, I guess since then the police chief has backed off and stopped acting like Santa Anna.
[02:47:03.540 --> 02:47:13.540]  Well, I don't know if the police chief is backed off, but I know that the beat cops out there, the, you know, the guys on the bikes, the guys walking around in their patrol cars, they have not been harassing us at all.
[02:47:13.540 --> 02:47:23.540]  As a matter of fact, today and this weekend, we were walking all around San Antonio with our rifles, identifying businesses that would allow us to come in with our weapons during the event.
[02:47:23.540 --> 02:47:32.540]  And so after the event, if you want to walk around and spend some money and go eat or whatever, just look for a small American flag in the window or the door of that shop.
[02:47:32.540 --> 02:47:37.540]  And that, that will identify them as a gun friendly, we call them gun friendly zones.
[02:47:37.540 --> 02:47:45.540]  You know, I was about to say that's a good idea nationwide. We should start a national movement with like a special American flag, maybe where the stars are.
[02:47:45.540 --> 02:47:54.540]  Maybe there's George Washington's face or something and then do business with pro gun places and use our economy to leverage out the anti-liberty people.
[02:47:54.540 --> 02:47:59.540]  Yeah, absolutely. And I'll tell you, we got an overwhelming response. We almost ran out of flags.
[02:47:59.540 --> 02:48:03.540]  I mean, that's how many businesses are very pro gun in downtown San Antonio.
[02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:12.540]  San Antonio is one of the best cities for liberty I've ever seen. I mean, the people there are just absolutely anti-New World Order.
[02:48:12.540 --> 02:48:21.540]  Right. Yeah. And we're not going to have any problems from the police officers. If we do, it's going to be coming from the top and it's going to be forced.
[02:48:21.540 --> 02:48:27.540]  Should I bring my M4 or should I bring my Barrett 50? That'll get a little bit heavy carrying that around.
[02:48:27.540 --> 02:48:32.540]  There you go. Bring the Barrett 50. I know I'm going to have my M4 on me.
[02:48:32.540 --> 02:48:41.540]  Well, I'm not a combat guy like you that's been carrying 75 pound packs around. I get tired carrying that thing a hundred yards.
[02:48:41.540 --> 02:48:44.540]  That would be a good stunt, though, wouldn't it?
[02:48:44.540 --> 02:48:51.540]  It would be. And if I had one, I'd probably force myself to endure the pain for a little while.
[02:48:51.540 --> 02:49:01.540]  But we're just trying to normalize it. Obviously, people don't walk around with Barrett 50 cows.
[02:49:01.540 --> 02:49:05.540]  Obviously, they have a very specific purpose and that's long range targeting.
[02:49:05.540 --> 02:49:12.540]  So we're trying to get people comfortable with seeing us carrying normal day to day weapons to show them the Second Amendment.
[02:49:12.540 --> 02:49:18.540]  I've been reading a lot of Supreme Court case law and guns and the Second Amendment applies to any weapon that's used by the military.
[02:49:18.540 --> 02:49:23.540]  That's what's protected under the Second Amendment and has nothing to do with hunting or shooting.
[02:49:23.540 --> 02:49:31.540]  So we want people to get out there and not just on Saturday, but hopefully after this weekend coming up,
[02:49:31.540 --> 02:49:37.540]  people will go out and walk around in their neighborhoods and walk around in their towns and show that an armed society is a polite society
[02:49:37.540 --> 02:49:42.540]  and that the sight of a gun doesn't mean that a guy is a criminal.
[02:49:42.540 --> 02:49:48.540]  There's a saying from back in Roman times that a sword is just a tool except in the hands of a killer.
[02:49:48.540 --> 02:49:54.540]  And that's kind of how we feel about a gun. It's just a tool. It's a self-defense tool.
[02:49:54.540 --> 02:50:00.540]  And if the state can defend itself with guns, then the people should be able to defend itself with guns.
[02:50:00.540 --> 02:50:08.540]  Well, I think the kleptocrats that run this country have jumped the shark, shutting down the veterans memorials and the national parks.
[02:50:08.540 --> 02:50:12.540]  It shows how out of touch these control freaks are.
[02:50:12.540 --> 02:50:17.540]  Well, it is. And the fact that they think they have the power to do that, that's what really gets me, Alex,
[02:50:17.540 --> 02:50:23.540]  is that we have given over the power of the federal government into every aspect of our lives that when the government shuts down,
[02:50:23.540 --> 02:50:28.540]  everyone freaks out as if the world's going to end. Everyone should be questioning that.
[02:50:28.540 --> 02:50:33.540]  How is it that everyone's so afraid of a government shutdown that we can't live our lives?
[02:50:33.540 --> 02:50:36.540]  We've become way too dependent and it's time we take it back.
[02:50:36.540 --> 02:50:40.540]  Well, CJ Gresham, I'm going to see you down there this Saturday at the Alamo, my friend.
[02:50:40.540 --> 02:50:42.540]  Yes, sir. I look forward to it.
[02:50:42.540 --> 02:50:45.540]  I look forward to seeing you in person. I feel like I know you've had you on a couple of times.
[02:50:45.540 --> 02:50:48.540]  God bless your courage and your fight for liberty, sir.
[02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:51.540]  Thank you. The trial starts tomorrow at Bell County.
[02:50:51.540 --> 02:50:54.540]  All right. Give out your private website, your personal website.
[02:50:54.540 --> 02:50:59.540]  Soldiersperspective.us. Soldiersperspective.us.
[02:50:59.540 --> 02:51:05.540]  Alex Jones here. And I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, my Patreon supply.
[02:51:05.540 --> 02:51:09.540]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS
[02:51:09.540 --> 02:51:14.540]  and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[02:51:14.540 --> 02:51:19.540]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies
[02:51:19.540 --> 02:51:22.540]  who share the same values as their fellow patriots.
[02:51:22.540 --> 02:51:27.540]  My Patreon supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand,
[02:51:27.540 --> 02:51:30.540]  along with many other fine preparedness products.
[02:51:30.540 --> 02:51:34.540]  I personally store and use their high quality products.
[02:51:34.540 --> 02:51:38.540]  It tastes great and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[02:51:38.540 --> 02:51:43.540]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four week supply of food,
[02:51:43.540 --> 02:51:45.540]  along with other special offers.

[02:52:04.540 --> 02:52:07.540]  My name's Matt Cook with GetEDSolutions.com.
[02:52:07.540 --> 02:52:12.540]  And I've developed a system that often fixes ED from home naturally, without medical intervention.
[02:52:12.540 --> 02:52:17.540]  How does it work? My system addresses the root cause of most ED, which is desensitization.
[02:52:17.540 --> 02:52:21.540]  Desensitization is not your fault, but it's the number one reason men get embarrassed around women.
[02:52:21.540 --> 02:52:23.540]  The more they try, the more things don't work.
[02:52:23.540 --> 02:52:28.540]  And the solution is to fix desensitization through simple activities you do from home.
[02:52:28.540 --> 02:52:32.540]  I purchased your product yesterday and it was fantastic.
[02:52:32.540 --> 02:52:36.540]  I have used your system for about three weeks and I'm already seeing great results.
[02:52:36.540 --> 02:52:41.540]  If you're one of the 52% of men who suffer from ED, you must visit GetEDSolutions.com

[02:53:54.540 --> 02:54:20.540]  Lysig eCigarettes for today's Modern Smoker.
[02:54:20.540 --> 02:54:32.540]  I'm going to a little bit overdrive to talk to Frankie, Frank and then of course Alan and Nadim, Matt and Chris.
[02:54:32.540 --> 02:54:37.540]  I'm going to go to you guys here in just a moment, but I want to get to the guy's question before our guest came on.
[02:54:37.540 --> 02:54:43.540]  Gunslinger from California, he asked, when will the collapse really accelerate?
[02:54:43.540 --> 02:54:47.540]  Our families are already collapsing. Our health is already collapsing.
[02:54:47.540 --> 02:54:52.540]  Our culture is already collapsing and then those of us that don't collapse and hold everything up,
[02:54:52.540 --> 02:54:59.540]  we're told how we're bad all day to keep us in a state of guilt so we'll do whatever the parasitic system says.
[02:54:59.540 --> 02:55:07.540]  Most of the welfare people are just victims of the system, a system that's deindustrialized, that's taken their jobs.
[02:55:07.540 --> 02:55:15.540]  We need to teach that most of the debt is not, most of the debt that's out there is not even related to the welfare.
[02:55:15.540 --> 02:55:19.540]  The welfare is bad because it makes you dependent.
[02:55:19.540 --> 02:55:24.540]  The real welfare is these foreign banks, but I don't know when the collapse is going to accelerate.
[02:55:24.540 --> 02:55:33.540]  It could be next week, it could be five years from now, but we're definitely moving into a political and economic quadrant of history
[02:55:33.540 --> 02:55:41.540]  that it just goes from bad to worse and that's what I'm really coming to grips with is that things are really as bad as we said they could be
[02:55:41.540 --> 02:55:45.540]  and they're worse and people better wake up.
[02:55:45.540 --> 02:55:50.540]  But folks don't usually wake up till it gets really bad and then the system's going to sit there and pose as a savior again
[02:55:50.540 --> 02:55:52.540]  and offer more tyranny.
[02:55:52.540 --> 02:55:55.540]  Oh, Obamacare didn't work? Well, give us even more socialist health care.
[02:55:55.540 --> 02:56:02.540]  Oh, that'll work. It's just these people, the globalists have no respect for them.
[02:56:02.540 --> 02:56:12.540]  Look at the stuff at the Walmart riots and the EBT cards and the weirdo police trying to beat up vets, you know, Korean war vets and stuff.
[02:56:12.540 --> 02:56:19.540]  I mean, it's just absolutely shameful. It's disgusting. It's disgusting that these people think they're God.
[02:56:19.540 --> 02:56:23.540]  It's a bunch of other news I didn't get to. This is out of WIBW.
[02:56:23.540 --> 02:56:28.540]  Shut down, paychecks for federal prisoners, but not for prison workers. I shouldn't laugh.
[02:56:28.540 --> 02:56:32.540]  Many veterans stop receiving disability checks due to government shutdown.
[02:56:32.540 --> 02:56:36.540]  So now they've begun that, but the federal prisoners get their checks.
[02:56:36.540 --> 02:56:42.540]  And Morris coming out now about how there is identity theft in Obamacare.
[02:56:42.540 --> 02:56:46.540]  It's just designed to destroy the country because the globalists are trying to take the nation down.
[02:56:46.540 --> 02:56:51.540]  They hate America. They hate our freedom. They hate the good part of America.
[02:56:51.540 --> 02:56:57.540]  America's never been perfect, but it's been heads above all the other countries because it really had some basic private property rights.
[02:56:57.540 --> 02:57:01.540]  And that is something the establishment can't deal with.
[02:57:01.540 --> 02:57:09.540]  Briefly, this broadcast is also listeners supported, not supported with taxpayer money like MSNBC or MPR and others.
[02:57:09.540 --> 02:57:12.540]  You didn't know MSNBC got stimulus money? Yeah, it does.

[02:58:00.540 --> 02:58:06.540]  and why the system doesn't want you to know about pure clean non-GMO based iodine.
[02:58:06.540 --> 02:58:10.540]  People say, well, iodine is not GMO. Yeah, a lot of the bases it's in are.
[02:58:10.540 --> 02:58:13.540]  This is glycerin based. I'm telling you, the difference between this.
[02:58:13.540 --> 02:58:18.540]  I dare you to try other so-called approved nascent iodine supplement use.

[03:00:20.540 --> 03:00:23.540]  Here's some of the news up on infowars.com.
[03:00:23.540 --> 03:00:30.540]  Girls threatened with hate crime charges for complaining about transgender bathroom harassment.
[03:00:30.540 --> 03:00:33.540]  Boys in the bathroom saying they're now allowed to be in there.
[03:00:33.540 --> 03:00:38.540]  And the school told them your rights as girls with privacy is trumped by these guys.
[03:00:38.540 --> 03:00:42.540]  Folks, I'm not attacking people that are transgender or whatever like Bradley Manning.
[03:00:42.540 --> 03:00:47.540]  Come on, but I mean, I've been in, I worked at the TV studio.
[03:00:47.540 --> 03:00:52.540]  Public access and work started my show there for many years.
[03:00:52.540 --> 03:00:58.540]  And the very famous transgender Leslie would come in there with his girlfriend or boyfriend, whatever,
[03:00:58.540 --> 03:01:02.540]  and do drugs in the bathroom and vomit all over the walls and everything.
[03:01:02.540 --> 03:01:04.540]  And they go in the men's bathroom, the women's bathroom.
[03:01:04.540 --> 03:01:06.540]  And I mean, it's just, it was disgusting.
[03:01:06.540 --> 03:01:09.540]  And not because the guy had long hair and wore dressed like a woman.
[03:01:09.540 --> 03:01:12.540]  He was a horrible person.
[03:01:12.540 --> 03:01:13.540]  And they all celebrate him in Austin.
[03:01:13.540 --> 03:01:17.540]  And it's just like, I was, they finally threw him out because of all of it.
[03:01:17.540 --> 03:01:22.540]  And it wasn't at the super liberal access TV because they were transgendered.
[03:01:22.540 --> 03:01:24.540]  He actually called himself a transvestite.
[03:01:24.540 --> 03:01:26.540]  This was a difference I've been told.
[03:01:26.540 --> 03:01:32.540]  The point is that he was the most disgusting person I've ever had to be around.
[03:01:32.540 --> 03:01:37.540]  And then I got an office I didn't know was next door to where he lived for I had to be around that for five years.
[03:01:37.540 --> 03:01:42.540]  I could write a book about Leslie Cochran, the real Leslie.
[03:01:42.540 --> 03:01:44.540]  It was just horrific.
[03:01:44.540 --> 03:01:45.540]  It was horrific.
[03:01:45.540 --> 03:01:48.540]  He was obviously completely mentally ill and I feel sorry for him.
[03:01:48.540 --> 03:01:52.540]  But there I got to go an even more overdrive because I promised to go to these calls.
[03:01:52.540 --> 03:01:53.540]  I'll be going to the next segment now.
[03:01:53.540 --> 03:01:55.540]  I'm having Leslie Cochran flashbacks.
[03:01:55.540 --> 03:01:57.540]  Let me just stop right there.
[03:01:57.540 --> 03:01:58.540]  Let's just stop right there.
[03:01:58.540 --> 03:02:00.540]  Let's go to Frank in Michigan.
[03:02:00.540 --> 03:02:01.540]  You're on the air.
[03:02:01.540 --> 03:02:02.540]  Welcome.
[03:02:02.540 --> 03:02:04.540]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[03:02:04.540 --> 03:02:05.540]  I'm doing all right.
[03:02:05.540 --> 03:02:08.540]  Hey, you know, I want to say something really quick.
[03:02:08.540 --> 03:02:18.540]  I know earlier you were pretty frustrated and getting pretty emotional about what's going on right now in the world.
[03:02:18.540 --> 03:02:21.540]  Yeah, no, I'm genuinely the most freaked out I've ever been.
[03:02:21.540 --> 03:02:24.540]  I am genuinely seeing all the nightmares come through.
[03:02:24.540 --> 03:02:25.540]  We're totally accurate.
[03:02:25.540 --> 03:02:26.540]  It's all right.
[03:02:26.540 --> 03:02:28.540]  And I'm not going, hey, I'm right.
[03:02:28.540 --> 03:02:29.540]  I'm like, oh my gosh.
[03:02:29.540 --> 03:02:31.540]  You see what I'm saying?
[03:02:31.540 --> 03:02:35.540]  I do, and I'll tell you what, I'm a family man.
[03:02:35.540 --> 03:02:36.540]  I know you are too.
[03:02:36.540 --> 03:02:37.540]  And I think that's the root of it.
[03:02:37.540 --> 03:02:42.540]  And, you know, it freaks me out just as much as you because I have a family too.
[03:02:42.540 --> 03:02:46.540]  I have two daughters and a wife and, you know, I just want to live my life.
[03:02:46.540 --> 03:02:47.540]  And I think you do too.
[03:02:47.540 --> 03:02:52.540]  And I think that's the root of it, you know.
[03:02:52.540 --> 03:02:55.540]  Yeah, and watching the domestication of America.
[03:02:55.540 --> 03:03:03.540]  I mean, watching us go under the control of this blob, this blob, that's what the government's like, the blob.
[03:03:03.540 --> 03:03:07.540]  It's just, and I just know it's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[03:03:07.540 --> 03:03:10.540]  Yeah, but, you know, I want to tell you something.
[03:03:10.540 --> 03:03:13.540]  And hopefully this helps you a little bit.
[03:03:13.540 --> 03:03:14.540]  I'm calling from Michigan.
[03:03:14.540 --> 03:03:15.540]  You're in Texas.
[03:03:15.540 --> 03:03:16.540]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:16.540 --> 03:03:17.540]  So how awesome is that?
[03:03:17.540 --> 03:03:24.540]  You know, you're touching the guy that's, you know, you don't know, but I'm listening and I'll tell you what.
[03:03:24.540 --> 03:03:28.540]  There are many people I know here, they're listening too.
[03:03:28.540 --> 03:03:31.540]  So your words out and it's growing.
[03:03:31.540 --> 03:03:33.540]  And I want you to keep that faith.
[03:03:33.540 --> 03:03:34.540]  Now, God bless you.
[03:03:34.540 --> 03:03:35.540]  And I appreciate that.
[03:03:35.540 --> 03:03:37.540]  And look, I'm not trying to demoralize people.
[03:03:37.540 --> 03:03:40.540]  I should get up here and be more positive than I usually am.
[03:03:40.540 --> 03:03:44.540]  It's just that I'm 100% honest on air about where I stand.
[03:03:44.540 --> 03:03:45.540]  There's no teleprompter.
[03:03:45.540 --> 03:03:47.540]  There's no talking points.
[03:03:47.540 --> 03:03:50.540]  It's almost like a hallucination how bad the government is.
[03:03:50.540 --> 03:03:59.540]  And that, and that we're at this weird paradox where there's the old good parts of America and the new good parts of America are still operating and everything in between.
[03:03:59.540 --> 03:04:07.540]  And there's just all this craziness, this unaccountability where people in government can get away with anything now at the highest levels.
[03:04:07.540 --> 03:04:09.540]  That's the madness of it.
[03:04:09.540 --> 03:04:11.540]  And history shows you give people total power.
[03:04:11.540 --> 03:04:13.540]  They go nuts.
[03:04:13.540 --> 03:04:15.540]  I mean, you give them total control.
[03:04:15.540 --> 03:04:17.540]  They will go crazy.
[03:04:17.540 --> 03:04:18.540]  And I think that's where it is.
[03:04:18.540 --> 03:04:20.540]  So I'm sorry if I've been really bummed out.
[03:04:20.540 --> 03:04:25.540]  I personally also get very freaked out about missing nuclear weapons.
[03:04:25.540 --> 03:04:30.540]  And then suddenly all the top nuke generals start getting fired and all this other stuff's going on.
[03:04:30.540 --> 03:04:32.540]  And to know this is a real story.
[03:04:32.540 --> 03:04:34.540]  I mean, I want that source to be wrong.
[03:04:34.540 --> 03:04:35.540]  I don't want to be in the middle of this.
[03:04:35.540 --> 03:04:37.540]  I want to be a coward.
[03:04:37.540 --> 03:04:41.540]  I almost didn't go with that story because I knew how dangerous it was and I couldn't help it.
[03:04:41.540 --> 03:04:42.540]  Here's what I don't like.
[03:04:42.540 --> 03:04:44.540]  I'm be honest with you.
[03:04:44.540 --> 03:04:46.540]  I don't like the fact that I can't sell out.
[03:04:46.540 --> 03:04:47.540]  I'm going to be honest.
[03:04:47.540 --> 03:04:48.540]  I just cannot.
[03:04:48.540 --> 03:04:51.540]  And then I realize where it's all headed.
[03:04:51.540 --> 03:04:53.540]  I just, I just, I don't know.
[03:04:53.540 --> 03:04:54.540]  We're going to come back with more calls.
[03:04:54.540 --> 03:04:55.540]  Stay there.
[03:04:55.540 --> 03:05:24.540]  Stay there.

[03:09:14.540 --> 03:09:15.540]  Stay there.
[03:09:15.540 --> 03:09:16.200]  Stay there.
[03:09:16.200 --> 03:09:17.540]  Stay there.
[03:09:17.540 --> 03:09:18.540]  Stay it.
[03:09:18.540 --> 03:09:19.540]  Stay there.
[03:09:19.540 --> 03:09:20.540]  Stay there.'
[03:09:20.540 --> 03:09:21.540]  Stay there.
[03:09:21.540 --> 03:09:22.540]  Stay there.

[03:09:23.540 --> 03:09:24.540]  Stay there.
[03:09:24.540 --> 03:09:30.380]  on average that the elitist are absolute total scum beyond anything imaginable there all of these
[03:09:30.380 --> 03:09:36.300]  groups together pressure from below and above famously this happened throughout history are
[03:09:36.300 --> 03:09:41.740]  attacking those of us that work hard and those of us that try to be good people and then there's
[03:09:41.740 --> 03:09:47.420]  no selling out i can do because the system is so crazy the worst of the worst run it and it's
[03:09:47.420 --> 03:09:52.380]  just megalomaniacal and so that's what i'm saying it's like there's no way out of this thing and
[03:09:52.380 --> 03:09:57.020]  i wouldn't sell out if i could my point is there is no selling out that's the big con game that
[03:09:57.020 --> 03:10:02.860]  so many followers of evil don't get is that is that is that you destroy yourself in the process
[03:10:03.980 --> 03:10:10.460]  and this system is going down this system is a fraud and so if i sound it down today i apologize
[03:10:11.660 --> 03:10:16.860]  i mean we had tosh plumley by the way is tosh plumley coming back on if we contacted him
[03:10:16.860 --> 03:10:22.940]  he's on tomorrow and then he talks to fox news and then they edit down everything he said and
[03:10:22.940 --> 03:10:26.860]  he is the famous whistleblower and he exposed bin gazi here on the air and now he's getting
[03:10:26.860 --> 03:10:33.740]  threatened and that's his last post was they're out to kill him and uh you think i like dropping
[03:10:33.740 --> 03:10:38.940]  that bomb on people it's like and now the nuke story is like 50 times worse than that and then
[03:10:38.940 --> 03:10:47.500]  then again i'm trying to explain to people it isn't thrilling i don't sit or try to break big
[03:10:47.500 --> 03:10:53.900]  stories to be an ego maniac i mean maybe 15 years ago was 90 because i cared about liberty and
[03:10:53.900 --> 03:10:59.100]  wanted to fight to do a lord or 10 wanted to be somebody now it's very strange to have none of
[03:10:59.100 --> 03:11:05.340]  the be somebody anymore none of the narcissism anymore i need that narcissism it's natural to
[03:11:05.340 --> 03:11:10.780]  have some of it psychologically it's natural to have i don't have it anymore all i have is the
[03:11:10.780 --> 03:11:15.500]  heart of just seat knowing the new world order and knowing how they operate and watching them
[03:11:15.500 --> 03:11:19.660]  game everybody and cheat everybody and i'm like it's like watching a bunch of blind
[03:11:19.660 --> 03:11:24.380]  lemmings being fed into the mouth of a giant snake and the lemmings are kissing the snake and
[03:11:24.380 --> 03:11:29.020]  thanking it for what it does and it's just like a slaughterhouse i don't know how to describe it
[03:11:29.020 --> 03:11:36.940]  and then all i want is what the guy said earlier as a family man there's nothing better than
[03:11:36.940 --> 03:11:40.460]  innocence there's nothing better than goodness there's nothing better than security there's
[03:11:40.460 --> 03:11:46.780]  nothing better than it's like man the whole world is a threat to my son and my daughters the whole
[03:11:46.780 --> 03:11:52.940]  world is a stinking rat infested scum ball and it's getting worse by the minute and it's declared
[03:11:52.940 --> 03:11:58.300]  war on anything that isn't degenerate like it is and i'm sick of it and i'll tell you that's
[03:11:58.300 --> 03:12:04.540]  nothing used to i had a corrupt side like like everybody does you know you like stuff that you
[03:12:04.540 --> 03:12:08.940]  shouldn't you know i just don't even have that anymore it's just like i don't know
[03:12:12.460 --> 03:12:20.060]  it's almost like my psyche is imploding as it expands like me the fleshful person is
[03:12:20.060 --> 03:12:28.780]  is imploding and disappearing and then my spiritual side and the side that understands
[03:12:28.780 --> 03:12:35.980]  thing is getting bigger but then i think there's a passage in the bible that the that with great
[03:12:35.980 --> 03:12:41.900]  knowledge comes great sorrow or with knowledge comes sorrow what's the exact quote bible verse
[03:12:41.900 --> 03:12:48.460]  about knowledge and sorrow the beginning of knowledge is sorrow and now i read the bible
[03:12:48.460 --> 03:12:51.980]  it's like oh i didn't get this when i was a teenager i didn't get this in sunday school
[03:12:51.980 --> 03:12:56.620]  i didn't get now it's like i'm reading on my oh my gosh i totally get this i totally get this i
[03:12:56.620 --> 03:13:01.340]  totally get that i totally and it's just it's bizarre it's it's it's and i don't mean sit
[03:13:01.340 --> 03:13:06.940]  there and talk about myself all day this is my journey and i know you're having your own journey
[03:13:08.300 --> 03:13:13.740]  and now corruption is even worse when i see it not because i'm on some high and mighty plane
[03:13:13.740 --> 03:13:20.540]  i realize how bad it is it's not like i'm even like a Pharisee because i know how wicked i am
[03:13:21.100 --> 03:13:26.780]  i am just frustrated by it i'm frustrated that i can't get rid of it myself because humanity
[03:13:26.780 --> 03:13:34.060]  has such incredible heights as our potential we have unbelievable unlimited potential made
[03:13:34.060 --> 03:13:39.900]  the image the creator of the universe but then we just seem to just plumb the depths of the
[03:13:39.900 --> 03:13:50.860]  nastiest stupidest most foolish levels ever seen far with much wisdom is much grief and he that have
[03:13:53.260 --> 03:14:00.860]  increased in knowledge increase this sorrow ecclesiastes 118 that's it
[03:14:06.220 --> 03:14:09.580]  people that say they want consciousness and that they want to be awake and they want to know
[03:14:09.580 --> 03:14:16.940]  the secrets i mean yes it's much better than being a slave but it's the knowledge of good and evil
[03:14:16.940 --> 03:14:22.220]  and it just intensifies and gets more and more extreme and i and i think it's the quickening
[03:14:22.220 --> 03:14:25.820]  everybody's freaked out right now because the whole world's lining up for some big stuff to
[03:14:25.820 --> 03:14:30.700]  happen and i think that's really what's going on here let's go ahead and talk to alan in
[03:14:30.700 --> 03:14:36.140]  Delaware thanks for holding her on the air thanks for having me again alex so it's good to be here
[03:14:36.140 --> 03:14:42.700]  i am uh as you know a native of washington dc in a beltway living in Delaware now as a refugee
[03:14:42.700 --> 03:14:48.700]  basically uh just got back from there and i have to tell you folks that the place is shut down
[03:14:48.700 --> 03:14:56.380]  like a gigantic gigantic armored truck uh you come in on new york avenue you got 37 cranes
[03:14:56.380 --> 03:15:05.180]  they're building down there like grant took richmond uh they are literally uh uh just absolutely
[03:15:05.180 --> 03:15:12.860]  turning that place into a gigantic femur region preface u n is everywhere we are in the 100 year
[03:15:12.860 --> 03:15:19.740]  shift of the uh paradigm shift of an esco and alex i've surmised i've thought about this you know
[03:15:19.740 --> 03:15:27.420]  i i've theorized and hypothesized my summary is this these nukes are being moved in order to
[03:15:27.420 --> 03:15:36.540]  basically maybe dejacket and rejacket because i we know that their prime their prime uh uh uh
[03:15:37.340 --> 03:15:44.700]  agenda is syria and iran am i right so they'll rejacket them with isotopes known to be in the
[03:15:44.700 --> 03:15:52.380]  iranian program to frame them you are exactly right on your channeling the spirit of all of
[03:15:52.380 --> 03:15:58.780]  your murdered and slaughtered descendants as i am this is how we roll my friend we're not stupid
[03:15:58.780 --> 03:16:05.260]  you've got to be able to read their posture do not pay attention to their words their writings
[03:16:05.260 --> 03:16:12.700]  and the bogus craft you see on the media take it for what it is get into the belly of the beast
[03:16:12.700 --> 03:16:19.180]  find out what's in their intestines and rip it out at its core and go north to the heart
[03:16:19.180 --> 03:16:26.060]  you will find out what you just said alex is a thousand percent spot on well i don't know if it's
[03:16:26.060 --> 03:16:29.900]  just and all i know is there's missing nuclear weapons from our source that believes it and now
[03:16:29.900 --> 03:16:33.020]  they're firing all the new generals and a bunch of other generals and there's something going on and
[03:16:33.020 --> 03:16:38.060]  i don't like it and i've never been this this this upset and i really the psychoanalyzing here on
[03:16:38.060 --> 03:16:44.780]  here why i feel so upset it's just the realization that we really have evil people that mean us harm
[03:16:44.780 --> 03:16:50.140]  in control who are building up for a major offensive and you can feel it you can see it you can
[03:16:50.140 --> 03:16:59.100]  intellectualize it it's all there and it's a feeling of i need to do more my my family
[03:17:00.140 --> 03:17:05.260]  and then at the core there's a sickness in that i really should be getting my family out of here
[03:17:05.260 --> 03:17:09.340]  and i know i've committed i know i'm putting it all here i'm going to sit i'm going to go right
[03:17:09.340 --> 03:17:13.820]  through it and i know that's what's got to be done we'll beat these people in the end it's just that
[03:17:13.820 --> 03:17:19.020]  they have such a bloodlust for us folks they're they're going to pull something big they are hell
[03:17:19.020 --> 03:17:25.740]  bent on bringing us down i mean you look at the globalist you look at the senators john mccain
[03:17:25.740 --> 03:17:31.580]  you look at michelle obama how demonic that woman is looking her eyes i mean she looks like a i mean
[03:17:31.580 --> 03:17:36.540]  just looks like a crazed wild woman uh you look at the other globalist you look at the you know
[03:17:36.540 --> 03:17:41.260]  the head of the imf that lady legronde looks totally evil and crazed but then their actions
[03:17:41.260 --> 03:17:46.780]  are what's crazed and then and and they want to dominate us they want to smash us they really
[03:17:46.780 --> 03:17:51.500]  want people to be poor and and and to kill prosperity they really want to cut development
[03:17:51.500 --> 03:17:57.100]  off in africa and asia and starve those people to death i mean they really are murderous scum
[03:17:57.100 --> 03:18:01.340]  they really are hell force we're going to skip this network break i'm going to go to the bottom
[03:18:01.340 --> 03:18:12.460]  of the hour live here thank you alan uh who's up next in georgia not den uh you're on the air go ahead
[03:18:13.740 --> 03:18:19.580]  how are you doing alex oh i'm just freaked out just uh god bless him for what you do
[03:18:19.580 --> 03:18:24.380]  you wake up a lot of people well i'm trying brother what's on your mind today
[03:18:24.380 --> 03:18:31.660]  i would say if you look at the history of this country i mean honestly speaking we have created
[03:18:31.660 --> 03:18:36.220]  psychological slave constantly going on welfare over the age of
[03:18:39.260 --> 03:18:44.780]  this all goes back to the last liberal president we had that's where the spikes started
[03:18:45.740 --> 03:18:50.780]  and constantly going up what they're doing this they're making people slave that's what they're
[03:18:50.780 --> 03:18:56.700]  doing so these people don't have a wife they can't stand up against us we're talking about
[03:18:56.700 --> 03:19:00.540]  starving the people all around the world you're starving people they're going to stop people in
[03:19:00.540 --> 03:19:07.340]  this country don't know later i agree no they're playing as they see us as you go ahead you were
[03:19:07.340 --> 03:19:13.500]  just talking about i'm sorry to cut you off missing you last president we had had four missing you
[03:19:13.500 --> 03:19:21.260]  you where are they going they were going to the middle east it's over and over and over
[03:19:21.260 --> 03:19:26.700]  has proved to be the most irresponsible government when it comes to the new tier
[03:19:28.780 --> 03:19:35.980]  bomb what i think personally i mean i will give you my point of view on it i think all
[03:19:35.980 --> 03:19:40.700]  these missing youth are going to the black market and they are selling it they are selling this
[03:19:40.700 --> 03:19:45.500]  world out for the cardboard wall well that's what they've always done that's what plumlee
[03:19:45.500 --> 03:19:50.300]  talks about it's on record they arm both sides like they're arming in fact there's evidence
[03:19:50.300 --> 03:19:56.540]  they're even arming Assad and al-qaeda to kill each other and the goal is just murder people
[03:19:58.220 --> 03:20:02.940]  just to murder people not only that if you if you look at the government shutdown 14 days
[03:20:02.940 --> 03:20:10.700]  what has been done nothing alex as i am from a terrible country i'm an immigrant in this country
[03:20:10.700 --> 03:20:16.540]  and i'm living in this country for about some time now which is construed about 19 years
[03:20:18.300 --> 03:20:23.740]  from my personal experience they are selling this country out oh yeah no no no they're openly
[03:20:23.740 --> 03:20:29.260]  arming and preparing for a war with the people and folks better understand going along with the
[03:20:29.260 --> 03:20:35.020]  system means nothing they're preparing for total war against america down the road when in their
[03:20:35.020 --> 03:20:42.300]  geopolitical plan when do you think that will be our government is preparing itself for a war
[03:20:42.300 --> 03:20:49.820]  against the masses that's what they're going to do on the 17th we will default by 18th he will
[03:20:49.820 --> 03:20:52.620]  invoke him and then see him he will probably impose much longer after
[03:20:52.620 --> 03:21:00.380]  yeah you know i thought obama would just grab a bunch of power i mean i know he makes a lot
[03:21:00.380 --> 03:21:04.780]  of decisions but their decisions he's been authorized to make and i know he's i say he's
[03:21:04.780 --> 03:21:09.100]  a puppet but but uh bill clinton wasn't really a puppet he was actually calling shots they put
[03:21:09.100 --> 03:21:14.620]  him in there because he would do what they said but he made a lot of this you know fine-tuning
[03:21:14.620 --> 03:21:19.180]  decisions that's on record nixon was running things to a great extent and more and more i
[03:21:19.180 --> 03:21:27.660]  realize obama obama and his controllers they really are calling the shots and they really do hate
[03:21:29.660 --> 03:21:34.300]  christians especially and uh or or anybody they don't control god bless you i appreciate your call
[03:21:35.980 --> 03:21:41.020]  god help us man i tell you it's just pure evil from the eugenics level at the highest level of
[03:21:41.020 --> 03:21:47.340]  my research into their activities they see the human population as a plague hurting the earth
[03:21:47.340 --> 03:21:54.860]  and they're an emergency war against us but then you study them individually they're just really
[03:21:54.860 --> 03:22:04.220]  dark wicked people and all i can tell the average person out there that works for the system or
[03:22:04.220 --> 03:22:09.180]  whatever if i was you i wouldn't be going along with the new world order we don't want this civil
[03:22:09.180 --> 03:22:13.820]  war we don't want all this horrible stuff to happen it's all coming up to debt default global
[03:22:13.820 --> 03:22:25.340]  crisis total meltdown ebt cards not melting not working and and and i'm sitting here trying to figure
[03:22:25.340 --> 03:22:30.620]  out scenarios where everything doesn't go to hell in a handbasket and it's really getting hard to do
[03:22:33.980 --> 03:22:40.620]  and they politically need crises so they can pose as a saviors and so they want all these crises
[03:22:40.620 --> 03:22:51.900]  because they think the public is too dumb to understand all this and and i guess they're just
[03:22:51.900 --> 03:23:00.860]  working too hard they're poisoned from the food poisoned from the gmo but congress has a very
[03:23:00.860 --> 03:23:05.740]  low approval rating lowest in history government has a low approval rating so i say the public's
[03:23:05.740 --> 03:23:13.820]  dumb they're not really dumb they just feel powerless i guess and then the government bureaucrat
[03:23:13.820 --> 03:23:24.220]  types really do act like they're hunting us and it's always the bureaucratic ticketing class that
[03:23:24.220 --> 03:23:29.260]  is designed to target the general public for petty stuff the nanny state that's the nasty
[03:23:29.260 --> 03:23:33.740]  ones that really look at you with hatred because they're they're pathetic people who don't have
[03:23:33.740 --> 03:23:39.020]  high IQs on average they're hired because they have low IQs and they're sent out there to basically
[03:23:39.020 --> 03:23:44.220]  hen pick everybody i guess to get us ready for the new conversion over to the pure slave state
[03:23:44.220 --> 03:23:50.940]  i mean i guess that's really it and i have a lot of empathy because i realize that at
[03:23:50.940 --> 03:23:56.140]  atomic level at a gut level that what happens other people ends up coming back on me
[03:23:56.140 --> 03:24:07.500]  you can quantify altruism and feeling people's concern and their pain biologically show that
[03:24:07.500 --> 03:24:11.500]  you have a good society you don't want to hurt other people because you empathize with them
[03:24:12.700 --> 03:24:16.700]  that's what's happening at a biological level you can scientifically quantify it
[03:24:17.260 --> 03:24:20.860]  and the globalists say well we've scientifically forgotten that we're going to kill everybody
[03:24:20.860 --> 03:24:24.700]  for your own good because you guys are a bunch of dumb animals so we're going to try to make you
[03:24:24.700 --> 03:24:28.940]  as dumb as we can to make this a self-fulfilling prophecy and for me that's an ultimate sin
[03:24:31.500 --> 03:24:36.300]  and i'll tell the establishment something if you studied universal law you've studied natural
[03:24:36.300 --> 03:24:43.580]  law common sense you're not going to screw everybody and end up inheriting the universe the
[03:24:43.580 --> 03:24:47.980]  kingdom of heaven i mean you're not you think you're going to do all this horrible stuff and that
[03:24:47.980 --> 03:24:52.860]  you're not going to be punished for it even if we don't believe in god there are natural laws you
[03:24:52.860 --> 03:24:58.620]  set up these giant meat grinders you set up this weird freak system you set up you try to make people
[03:24:58.620 --> 03:25:05.420]  as demonic and bad as you can they're going to destroy you and you're going to destroy yourself
[03:25:05.420 --> 03:25:11.420]  it is going to be craziness and i think that's why i'm so freaked out is that i've come to grips with
[03:25:11.420 --> 03:25:17.420]  the fact that it's madness the establishment is insane let's go ahead and talk to matt in south
[03:25:17.420 --> 03:25:25.260]  carolina matt you're on the air thanks for holding hey mr jones i wanted to ask you about that thing
[03:25:25.260 --> 03:25:33.020]  that you said at the beginning of the show you said something about the power grid going down
[03:25:33.020 --> 03:25:39.740]  and then staging a drill in november do you have any information on what specific day they're going
[03:25:39.740 --> 03:25:44.940]  to do that on it starts november 1st i got a bunch of other drills going on it's been in the new york
[03:25:44.940 --> 03:25:53.580]  times we've reported on it a lot just type in fema region 3 power drill uh or emergency drill
[03:25:53.580 --> 03:25:57.260]  and it's huge and they're basically using the drill as the cover for something big there's
[03:25:57.260 --> 03:26:00.300]  never been anything like this i don't know if something big is going to happen during it
[03:26:01.180 --> 03:26:06.620]  but they're using it as a cog drill continuity of government drill and of infrastructure drill
[03:26:06.620 --> 03:26:19.580]  to test federalization of the grid it's the n-e-r-c grid x grid ex2 grid security exercise 2013
[03:26:20.300 --> 03:26:26.380]  north american electric reliability corporation that's just a part of the overall fema operation
[03:26:26.380 --> 03:26:36.940]  the reason i uh that popped into my brain so hard is that the art fell uh earlier this week
[03:26:36.940 --> 03:26:42.540]  said that the government was going to announce something huge on november 13th so i don't know
[03:26:42.540 --> 03:26:45.500]  if there has anything to do with that i mean look it looks like they're maneuvering us towards a
[03:26:45.500 --> 03:26:53.340]  1933 default on purpose to then put us under imf world bank rule which they've already done privately
[03:26:53.340 --> 03:26:56.540]  and yeah we're just being prepared to be maneuvered in a total bankruptcy like race
[03:26:57.580 --> 03:27:02.220]  all right thanks man thank you and i don't know if that's going to happen
[03:27:03.340 --> 03:27:07.980]  but you mix missing nukes into this and the huge parts of the command structure being fired
[03:27:07.980 --> 03:27:12.540]  and then here's the big one ap being told that they weren't supposed to talk about
[03:27:14.060 --> 03:27:17.820]  this info and they had to have it leaked to them they don't want you know
[03:27:17.820 --> 03:27:25.260]  to know why they were moving the nuke generals i mean that that right there is just has coup written
[03:27:25.260 --> 03:27:30.780]  all over it and then just like the swat team said they were ordered to stand down at the
[03:27:30.780 --> 03:27:35.740]  navy yard shooting we received that info first we reported on it and they got a hold of bbc and
[03:27:35.740 --> 03:27:45.980]  they reported on it of all people our sources try to go to other people too tosh plumley tried
[03:27:45.980 --> 03:27:49.340]  to go to fox news they finally ran it and then stabbed in the back
[03:27:51.900 --> 03:27:56.860]  i guess i'm the only person crazy enough to break this stuff and i guess michael savages is too
[03:27:57.500 --> 03:28:02.140]  so hats off to the people that are willing to talk about stuff like this i mean it's just
[03:28:03.420 --> 03:28:08.700]  christian main last caller of time for sorry the others go ahead hi how you doing how much
[03:28:08.700 --> 03:28:18.220]  a couple things i wanted to talk about if it's okay on the nuke's issue there i'm just curious
[03:28:18.220 --> 03:28:25.260]  about why the mainstream media isn't talking about um you know it wasn't it's been nine top
[03:28:25.260 --> 03:28:33.660]  military officials fired here i'm thinking it's more than that it's it's in the it's like 30 something
[03:28:33.660 --> 03:28:39.660]  generals and admirals the last two years and and then it's the two top nuke guys and now the two top
[03:28:39.660 --> 03:28:47.740]  in the last week it's like five generals and you know we're talking like north korea everybody
[03:28:47.740 --> 03:28:52.540]  talks about he's trying to get military close to him over there and all that's a little oh yeah
[03:28:52.540 --> 03:28:56.780]  oh yeah oh yeah when kim jong-un removes one general it's international news yeah exactly
[03:28:56.780 --> 03:29:02.780]  right so i mean i'm saying to myself well you know is he trying to get these people well
[03:29:02.780 --> 03:29:08.060]  more aligned to him you mean obama oh yeah that's what he said about carrie the head nuke commander
[03:29:08.060 --> 03:29:18.220]  the major general uh he said i don't have trust in you yeah it's crazy it's very scary stuff going on
[03:29:18.780 --> 03:29:24.780]  um another thing i wanted to talk about was this this shutdown on the obama care issue
[03:29:24.780 --> 03:29:31.660]  um my wife is very very very ill and just in in the last year i bring you to the hospital
[03:29:31.660 --> 03:29:37.660]  when she's sick and the doctors don't admit her things have always admitted oh no no no
[03:29:37.660 --> 03:29:43.900]  that's obama care now you pay double you don't get care but he loves this and sir you're a racist
[03:29:43.900 --> 03:29:55.740]  that you don't like it i hope your wife gets better not only news coming up seven o'clock
