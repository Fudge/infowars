[00:00.000 --> 00:16.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, there have been a lot of important broadcasts in Infowars history.
[00:16.120 --> 00:26.640]  I myself have had a lot of very important broadcasts in my eight years here at Infowars,
[00:26.640 --> 00:37.640]  but perhaps on this Monday, July 25, 2022, at least for the issue of free speech, or
[00:37.640 --> 00:43.320]  on the issue of, does Alex Jones even get to exist and have a platform and have a voice
[00:43.320 --> 00:45.440]  and be on the air?
[00:45.440 --> 00:52.160]  As far as those issues are concerned, this might be the biggest transmission in Infowars
[00:52.160 --> 00:53.160]  history.
[00:53.160 --> 01:00.360]  Now, Owen Schreuer sitting in for Alex today, it's an honor, and I will be sitting in for
[01:00.360 --> 01:08.800]  Alex for the foreseeable future, because Alex Jones is in court this week and next week
[01:08.800 --> 01:18.280]  and who knows how long, fighting for free speech for America and fighting for Infowars
[01:18.280 --> 01:21.800]  to continue to go on.
[01:21.800 --> 01:28.040]  Let me lay out the basics here for you and we'll get into the gruesome details coming
[01:28.040 --> 01:36.800]  up the rest of the way in the first hour with legal expertise coverage of what's about to
[01:36.800 --> 01:47.520]  go down, then in the second hour we'll have the legal experts in studio with me as well.
[01:47.520 --> 01:52.880]  But Alex Jones is going to be in court, in fact, I'm going to be in court some of these
[01:52.880 --> 01:59.200]  days as well, and so imagine how many other news outlets have to deal with that, none
[01:59.200 --> 02:00.200]  really.
[02:00.200 --> 02:03.080]  In fact, there's really two other people I would say in media that deal with the political
[02:03.080 --> 02:08.000]  persecution anywhere close to the level of us here, and that's obviously Steve Bannon
[02:08.000 --> 02:15.120]  and Roger Stone and what they've had to go through.
[02:15.120 --> 02:20.880]  But so Alex Jones now in court all week fighting for his right to free speech and for America's
[02:20.880 --> 02:26.360]  right to free speech, and a lot of people may say, hey, that's not fair to say, that's
[02:26.360 --> 02:29.200]  not accurate to say.
[02:29.200 --> 02:33.640]  Alex Jones is in court for things that he said and he does, that has nothing to do with
[02:33.640 --> 02:35.480]  the free speech issue in America.
[02:35.480 --> 02:41.520]  Well, you'd be horribly mistaken if you fell for that lie, you'd be horribly mistaken.
[02:41.520 --> 02:46.400]  Now, again, we're going to go to the legal experts on this, so you don't have to hear
[02:46.400 --> 02:52.040]  my opinion as somebody that's involved or as a talk show host here with interest in
[02:52.040 --> 02:53.040]  the matter.
[02:53.040 --> 02:57.400]  You'll hear what the legal experts have to say coming up.
[02:57.400 --> 03:00.640]  But let me just ask you a question.
[03:00.640 --> 03:06.240]  Let's put it in the context of a question.
[03:06.240 --> 03:16.960]  If you had a radical liberal that was a judge and that judge got an Alex Jones case in
[03:16.960 --> 03:27.760]  front of them, do you think they would be responding to the case from a perspective
[03:27.760 --> 03:34.920]  of I need to put away any biases that I have and I need to make sure that justice is done
[03:34.920 --> 03:40.000]  here and that we have a true, fair proceeding here?
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.480]  Or do you think that liberal might say, I've got Alex Jones in front of me, I've got one
[03:45.480 --> 03:50.560]  shot to destroy him, I've got one shot to destroy Info Wars, I'm going to take it?
[03:50.560 --> 03:56.000]  Now, let's just say that's a hypothetical question, how do you think that would go?
[03:56.000 --> 04:03.480]  And then depending on how that would go or how that potentially does go, you don't think
[04:03.480 --> 04:06.520]  that has implications for the rest of America.
[04:06.520 --> 04:10.800]  You don't think that has implications for the rest of the media.
[04:10.800 --> 04:16.560]  If an activist judge can just decide they don't like you and they're going to destroy
[04:16.560 --> 04:21.600]  you, and then that becomes precedent.
[04:21.600 --> 04:25.320]  If you don't see how that's dangerous for the future of this country, and if you don't
[04:25.320 --> 04:31.640]  see how that's dangerous for the future of free speech, then you're blind.
[04:31.640 --> 04:39.280]  So when we come back, we're going to be hearing legal experts take first response to what's
[04:39.280 --> 04:44.960]  about to go down in court, but folks understand this, there's a reason why Alex Jones has
[04:44.960 --> 04:49.560]  been saying more than ever, this could be our last transmission.
[04:49.560 --> 04:54.360]  So I'll expand on that a little further before we go to the lawyers here on the Alex Jones
[04:54.360 --> 05:03.040]  show when we return from this short break sold out for more than six months.
[05:03.040 --> 05:06.680]  Our number one bestseller is now back in stock.

[05:23.280 --> 05:24.280]  It's great.
[05:24.280 --> 05:27.920]  People love it because it tastes great and they see the results and it funds the info

[05:42.720 --> 05:43.720]  But who knows?
[05:43.720 --> 05:44.720]  Why change breakdowns?

[06:29.920 --> 06:35.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, I will be filling in for Alex for the foreseeable future.
[06:35.800 --> 06:36.800]  We're really not sure.
[06:36.800 --> 06:38.880]  It depends on how these court things go.
[06:38.880 --> 06:43.440]  Alex is in court today for the foreseeable future as well.
[06:43.440 --> 06:45.480]  I'm also going to have to be in court.
[06:45.480 --> 06:52.560]  So even my exposure is going to be limited in the upcoming weeks as well.
[06:52.560 --> 06:58.880]  But to pick it up where I left off in the first opening segment here, a lot of people
[06:58.880 --> 07:02.760]  have been commenting and you may have noticed more than ever Alex comes on air and says
[07:02.760 --> 07:06.200]  this could be our last broadcast.
[07:06.200 --> 07:12.680]  And while we did have financial problems and we were having problems funding ourselves,
[07:12.680 --> 07:18.600]  here the crew and everybody, we were able to assure that we could be funded through
[07:18.600 --> 07:22.440]  the summer with some of the sales we had, getting some products back in stock and having
[07:22.440 --> 07:25.880]  the money bomb and some generous donors.
[07:25.880 --> 07:30.800]  That all went down earlier this year in the beginning of spring.
[07:30.800 --> 07:33.880]  And we basically said this was a big success.
[07:33.880 --> 07:35.640]  The audience has done it again.
[07:35.640 --> 07:37.840]  We've now got funding through the summer.
[07:37.840 --> 07:43.840]  So we took care of some of the financial stuff as far as that being a major issue, at least
[07:43.840 --> 07:45.240]  through the summer.
[07:45.240 --> 07:46.760]  So we said, hey, we've got the funding now.
[07:46.760 --> 07:49.680]  We can stay on till the summer.
[07:49.680 --> 07:56.000]  And that's when we're going to have our next big challenge, which is the legal challenge.
[07:56.000 --> 08:03.320]  Now we're going to hear from legal experts in this hour some of the gruesome details
[08:03.320 --> 08:08.280]  of what is about to happen in this court case going on all week and next week and for the
[08:08.280 --> 08:10.320]  foreseeable future.
[08:10.320 --> 08:14.800]  Then we're going to have Robert Barnes in studio with follow up coverage and some of
[08:14.800 --> 08:20.800]  the latest breaking stuff as it begins.
[08:20.800 --> 08:27.080]  But there's a couple of things that are key to understanding.
[08:27.080 --> 08:33.320]  One is there is no other media outlet that goes through what we go through.
[08:33.320 --> 08:34.760]  And that's not because we're criminals.
[08:34.760 --> 08:36.080]  That's not because we're bad people.
[08:36.080 --> 08:37.560]  That's not because we've done anything wrong.
[08:37.560 --> 08:44.040]  It's because we are really going head to head, toe to toe, intellectually, philosophically,
[08:44.040 --> 08:49.920]  politically against the criminals that run this planet and have plans for world domination
[08:49.920 --> 08:52.360]  and depopulation.
[08:52.360 --> 08:56.880]  And they know we're one of the biggest threats standing in their way just as a populist voice
[08:56.880 --> 09:02.440]  as a voice of reason and truth and hope and patriotism and everything else.
[09:02.440 --> 09:08.480]  And so that's why Infowars or Alex Jones better yet must be made an example of must
[09:08.480 --> 09:10.640]  be destroyed.
[09:10.640 --> 09:13.440]  Now here's an example.
[09:13.440 --> 09:15.040]  We've got a fantastic crew here.
[09:15.040 --> 09:22.120]  We've got an unbelievable multimedia operation here, but crew probably hasn't been given
[09:22.120 --> 09:29.680]  a raise in a long time, and they try to get judgments against me, and they say, we're
[09:29.680 --> 09:33.040]  going to get millions of dollars out of Owen Shroyer.
[09:33.040 --> 09:34.280]  We're going to get millions of dollars.
[09:34.280 --> 09:37.880]  Folks, I don't have millions of dollars.
[09:37.880 --> 09:41.160]  To be quite honest with you, I don't even have close to a million dollars.
[09:41.160 --> 09:44.440]  But see, they see what we do here.
[09:44.440 --> 09:47.840]  They see our audience size, and then they just do a compare.
[09:47.840 --> 09:51.120]  They compare to other people in media to see what they're making, and they say, there's
[09:51.120 --> 09:55.440]  no way Owen Shroyer doesn't have a million dollars with his audience and what he's done.
[09:55.440 --> 09:56.560]  He has a million dollars.
[09:56.560 --> 09:57.560]  We're going to find it.
[09:57.560 --> 09:58.560]  We're going to get it.
[09:58.560 --> 09:59.560]  They do the research.
[09:59.560 --> 10:00.560]  They have all my records.
[10:00.560 --> 10:01.560]  They have everything.
[10:01.560 --> 10:05.080]  There's no million dollars.
[10:05.080 --> 10:06.760]  We're not in it for money, folks.
[10:06.760 --> 10:08.080]  We're not in it for fame.
[10:08.080 --> 10:09.560]  We're not in it for fortune.
[10:09.560 --> 10:10.760]  Never has been that way.
[10:10.760 --> 10:12.680]  Never will be that way.
[10:12.680 --> 10:15.760]  When I like millions of dollars or I like beachfront properties all around the world
[10:15.760 --> 10:19.200]  like all these great liberals, of course I would.
[10:19.200 --> 10:24.600]  I'd rather live in a free country with the opportunity for prosperity than to have all
[10:24.600 --> 10:28.960]  that momentarily.
[10:28.960 --> 10:32.600]  So just understand, there's a reason why info wars is target number one.
[10:32.600 --> 10:36.400]  There's a reason why Alex Jones is in court today, in my opinion, fighting for not only
[10:36.400 --> 10:40.480]  his right to free speech, but for the rights of free speech for all Americans.
[10:40.480 --> 10:47.280]  Now, here's a basic recap and introduction from the Barnes Free Podcast that we're going
[10:47.280 --> 10:51.720]  to be going to for the rest of the hour because, forget about my opinion, let's go to the legal
[10:51.720 --> 10:56.600]  experts who are covering this case.
[10:56.600 --> 11:02.880]  So here is the Barnes and Free Podcast, just an introduction of what is coming up here,
[11:02.880 --> 11:08.680]  what Alex Jones, what info wars, what America is up against in the coming weeks in these
[11:08.680 --> 11:13.000]  important times, these perilous times for free speech for info wars and for America.
[11:13.000 --> 11:19.640]  We'll get to everything, but let's start with the Alex Jones trial coming up.
[11:19.640 --> 11:22.680]  We're going to go over some stuff that we've already talked about in the past.
[11:22.680 --> 11:28.640]  How is it that Jones has been declared guilty on the merits by default?
[11:28.640 --> 11:31.440]  Yeah, it's extraordinary.
[11:31.440 --> 11:39.120]  So the suit that is going to trial this week in Austin, Texas and Travis County is by two
[11:39.120 --> 11:45.240]  plaintiffs who were the parents of a child who died at Sandy Hook.
[11:45.240 --> 11:53.600]  They sued Alex Jones on theories of defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
[11:53.600 --> 12:00.880]  Even though Alex Jones, as I recall, never mentioned them by name ever or said factually
[12:00.880 --> 12:04.480]  specific things about them by name ever.
[12:04.480 --> 12:09.960]  So it was a unique case in that regard, but the Texas Austin Court of Appeals basically
[12:09.960 --> 12:14.920]  established a perilous new precedent for speech in media in America, which was that
[12:14.920 --> 12:20.760]  if you say something that the government doesn't agree with and somebody is upset or offended
[12:20.760 --> 12:29.280]  by what you said and they have some connection at any level to the event, then you can be
[12:29.280 --> 12:35.000]  sued for intentional infliction of emotional distress without actually targeting any speech
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.600]  at them individually.
[12:36.600 --> 12:40.440]  So that was the first extraordinary development in his case.
[12:40.440 --> 12:41.880]  In this case, that's going to trial.
[12:41.880 --> 12:47.360]  The second one is the media mythology about the case, and often the plaintiff's lawyers
[12:47.360 --> 12:53.720]  repeatedly lie about the nature of the evidence in the case, is the mythology is that Alex
[12:53.720 --> 13:03.000]  Jones instigated and initiated and originated the hypothesis that Sandy Hook did not happen
[13:03.000 --> 13:04.440]  at all.
[13:04.440 --> 13:06.800]  That is completely and utterly false.
[13:06.800 --> 13:13.120]  99% of what Infowars printed, published, or broadcast concerning Sandy Hook acknowledged
[13:13.120 --> 13:18.120]  and admitted that the event occurred, that the children died, that it took place, who
[13:18.120 --> 13:19.680]  the shooter was.
[13:19.680 --> 13:26.360]  The questions that Infowars primarily and Alex Jones primarily raised concern the culpability
[13:26.360 --> 13:31.520]  of Big Pharma and whether SSRI drugs were the appropriate medication, the questions
[13:31.520 --> 13:37.560]  about the psychiatric treatment of young men in America, the celebration of gun violence
[13:37.560 --> 13:44.280]  by gaming and Hollywood culture, and the potential culpability and complicity in local police
[13:44.280 --> 13:50.520]  response times and local politicians in the school safety arena providing adequate safety
[13:50.520 --> 13:52.600]  mechanisms for the children.
[13:52.600 --> 13:57.680]  And he said that they were going to wrongfully blame the gun and the law-abiding rights and
[13:57.680 --> 14:03.080]  Second Amendment rights of ordinary Americans as the culprit for these traumatic and tragic
[14:03.080 --> 14:05.920]  deaths.
[14:05.920 --> 14:12.160]  Midway through, several years after Sandy Hook, some callers would call in and they raised
[14:12.160 --> 14:17.720]  questions about whether the deaths happened at all, and Jones responded in a way that
[14:17.720 --> 14:21.280]  could be interpreted as agreeing with their comments.
[14:21.280 --> 14:24.440]  That is the primary basis of the suit.
[14:24.440 --> 14:31.680]  About of the 7 million plus words broadcast by, plus words, broadcast or published by
[14:31.680 --> 14:38.880]  Infowars and Alex Jones, they've taken about less than 30 minutes of words scattered out
[14:38.880 --> 14:45.960]  over a 7-year time frame and are saying that is the entire basis of their emotional trauma.
[14:45.960 --> 14:52.560]  What is the second significant factor about this case that is also extraordinary is that
[14:52.560 --> 14:57.080]  it's one of the only defamation cases ever brought where the plaintiffs did not timely
[14:57.080 --> 14:59.400]  seek a correction or retraction.
[14:59.400 --> 15:05.400]  Indeed, they didn't seek it until the eve of trial itself, the eve of suit itself.
[15:05.400 --> 15:09.560]  And so you have people saying that they were horribly traumatized by the words of Alex
[15:09.560 --> 15:15.800]  Jones, yet showed no evidence that they even heard the words of Alex Jones at the time.
[15:15.800 --> 15:20.280]  And if they were so traumatized, why didn't they write a single correction or retraction
[15:20.280 --> 15:23.280]  request for years?
[15:23.280 --> 15:28.440]  The other factor that's interesting about this case is that many of the plaintiffs involved
[15:28.440 --> 15:29.720]  are very political.
[15:29.720 --> 15:34.160]  They have people running for political office, they've campaigned for gun control, they clearly
[15:34.160 --> 15:41.000]  oppose Alex Jones on political grounds, the lawyers involved are all highly political
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.320]  and have pursued this case for political reasons and have explicitly said their purpose of
[15:45.320 --> 15:52.080]  the suit is to try to shut down and censor Alex Jones for good.
[15:52.080 --> 16:04.360]  Any other implications for amendment number one sold out for seven months, bodies, ultimate
[16:04.360 --> 16:07.480]  turmeric formula is back in stock.
[16:07.480 --> 16:12.400]  Turmeric's been known for thousands of years to do amazing things for your joints, your
[16:12.400 --> 16:15.320]  stamina, your immune system, your libido.
[16:15.320 --> 16:19.880]  And look, the average type of the shelves is five, six, seven percent curcuminoid.
[16:19.880 --> 16:26.680]  We have the strongest brand on earth, nobody else decided to do it at 95 percent curcuminoid

[17:06.600 --> 17:09.000]  we've known and what's to come.

[17:27.240 --> 17:28.680]  own society.
[17:28.680 --> 17:34.280]  All we got to do is survive the crash and right now we still have time to prepare.
[17:34.280 --> 17:38.520]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[17:38.520 --> 17:44.840]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water and survival gear to
[17:44.840 --> 17:47.280]  keep us strong and at the ready.

[19:52.440 --> 19:53.840]  This is survival.

[19:56.000 --> 20:01.240]  Preparetoday.com and I'll see you there.
[20:01.240 --> 20:17.560]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:17.560 --> 20:25.520]  Imagine you're in a courtroom to defend yourself and the judge says, shut up, you're not allowed
[20:25.520 --> 20:26.520]  to defend yourself.
[20:26.520 --> 20:30.480]  Wouldn't be a pretty good feeling, would it?
[20:30.480 --> 20:35.840]  No, that would be pretty gut wrenching, pretty stomach sinking.
[20:35.840 --> 20:38.920]  If that happened to you, let's hope it never would.
[20:38.920 --> 20:40.760]  Let's hope it doesn't happen to Alex Jones.
[20:40.760 --> 20:44.080]  Here's more from the Barnes Free Podcast.
[20:44.080 --> 20:51.960]  Now what's even more extraordinary about this case is that Alex Jones is being prevented
[20:51.960 --> 20:56.320]  from presenting any substantive defense on the legal merits.
[20:56.320 --> 21:01.680]  He's not being allowed to defend himself on whether or not he said what they claim he
[21:01.680 --> 21:02.680]  said.
[21:02.680 --> 21:06.200]  He's not being allowed to defend the context in which those words were said.
[21:06.200 --> 21:10.240]  He's not allowed to present all everything else that he said.
[21:10.240 --> 21:14.320]  He is not even allowed to say that his conduct wasn't outrageous.
[21:14.320 --> 21:17.320]  He's not even allowed to say that he is innocent.
[21:17.320 --> 21:21.440]  He is not even allowed to say that he sees this as a First Amendment issue.
[21:21.440 --> 21:26.520]  In fact, the words First Amendment and free speech, he cannot even come out of his mouth
[21:26.520 --> 21:31.320]  or any witness's mouth or his lawyer's mouth through the entire trial.
[21:31.320 --> 21:38.120]  Not only that, the case is being limited to damages and the judge has instructed that
[21:38.120 --> 21:43.680]  the jury is not allowed to hear from Alex Jones or his lawyers about whether the emotional
[21:43.680 --> 21:48.800]  trauma they'll hear about these parents suffering had something to do with the person who shot
[21:48.800 --> 21:50.320]  their kids.
[21:50.320 --> 21:52.000]  That's not allowed to come up.
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.680]  The jury is going to be left with the impression that this horrible trauma that these parents
[21:56.680 --> 22:03.840]  have suffered, the only person they're being allowed to blame is Alex Jones.
[22:03.840 --> 22:08.160]  In addition, Alex Jones has been denied his rights to bring motions to dismiss, denied
[22:08.160 --> 22:13.320]  his right to bring motions under the strategic litigation against public participation law,
[22:13.320 --> 22:18.080]  denied his rights to bring summary judgment motions, denied his rights to appeal summary
[22:18.080 --> 22:23.880]  judgment motions, denied his rights in some cases to appeal a motion to dismiss.
[22:23.880 --> 22:29.680]  It is unparalleled and unprecedented the sequence of actions that have taken place.
[22:29.680 --> 22:37.240]  This case makes a Stasi or Soviet style show trial look like an emblem of fairness by comparison.
[22:37.240 --> 22:41.760]  Last but not least, the judge presiding over the case here in Austin, Texas, was identified
[22:41.760 --> 22:47.360]  in the press as previously working as private counsel associated with children protective
[22:47.360 --> 22:48.360]  services.
[22:48.360 --> 22:52.320]  What I can tell you that typically means, don't know yet whether it means that is to
[22:52.320 --> 22:58.760]  this judge, but typically that means a judge who defends pedophiles, a judge who defends
[22:58.760 --> 23:00.840]  child abusers.
[23:00.840 --> 23:03.960]  That's the judge presiding over the Alex Jones case.
[23:03.960 --> 23:09.200]  This case is a case where the American judicial system is really on trial and unfortunately
[23:09.200 --> 23:14.600]  the verdict looks like it will be a damnation of that system even though the goal is to
[23:14.600 --> 23:20.420]  issue such a crazy verdict that they are able to completely take Alex Jones off the
[23:20.420 --> 23:22.420]  air.
[23:22.420 --> 23:25.920]  Robert, so this is the question.
[23:25.920 --> 23:32.160]  So many actually because intentional infliction of emotional distress conceptually I can understand.
[23:32.160 --> 23:37.040]  They're already going through trauma because I want everyone to understand this.
[23:37.040 --> 23:41.360]  It's a horrible, horrible incident.
[23:41.360 --> 23:44.440]  It's horror of the purest form.
[23:44.440 --> 23:52.200]  Nothing about a defensive Alex Jones is intended to be construed as denying it happened, denying
[23:52.200 --> 23:57.640]  the trauma of everyone who survived that and the parents who lost his none of that.
[23:57.640 --> 24:04.080]  This is a grotesque incident where the grotesqueness of the incident is not going to be somehow
[24:04.080 --> 24:11.000]  attenuated by railroading some podcaster radio host who might have said some things which
[24:11.000 --> 24:15.600]  could have been a little over the top from time to time or even overtly over the top.
[24:15.600 --> 24:20.000]  The idea here is that you have Alex Jones is known for pushing the envelope of questioning
[24:20.000 --> 24:26.360]  narratives, floating hypotheses which are tenable sometimes, untenable other times.
[24:26.360 --> 24:31.560]  The emotional distress might have been aggravated and someone comes out and says, you're lying,
[24:31.560 --> 24:33.600]  you never even had a kid.
[24:33.600 --> 24:38.840]  That can cause emotional distress and if they do it at a loud enough bullhorn, they can
[24:38.840 --> 24:41.760]  cause emotional distress, I understand that.
[24:41.760 --> 24:48.320]  Nonetheless, the idea to deny Alex the ability to defend and this was purportedly on the
[24:48.320 --> 24:53.720]  basis for having defaulted or violated his obligations of disclosure under depositions?
[24:53.720 --> 25:01.560]  Yeah, I mean, what's amazing is Alex Jones has produced more documents and sat for more
[25:01.560 --> 25:10.200]  hours of more testimony as have other people in the case on behalf of Info Wars than any
[25:10.200 --> 25:15.920]  media defendant I've ever heard of and yet, even though he's turned over his text, he's
[25:15.920 --> 25:20.400]  turned over his emails, turned over stuff that was sent to a junk email box, turned
[25:20.400 --> 25:27.480]  over all kinds of documents and information, they said that he didn't turn over enough
[25:27.480 --> 25:28.640]  and they called him default.
[25:28.640 --> 25:32.840]  Now, here's the real secret behind this and why I predicted that this was a risk from
[25:32.840 --> 25:38.200]  day one and for those out there, I am not currently representing Alex Jones, so I am
[25:38.200 --> 25:40.640]  free to speak my mind.
[25:40.640 --> 25:46.120]  They're already, apparently I've heard that the plaintiff's lawyers are complaining about
[25:46.120 --> 25:48.040]  me speaking out about the case.
[25:48.040 --> 25:50.600]  That's how corrupt these plaintiff's lawyers are.
[25:50.600 --> 25:55.920]  They're political hacks standing on the bodies of dead kids to line their pockets and take
[25:55.920 --> 25:57.920]  away other people's political rights.
[25:57.920 --> 26:00.840]  And I find it disgusting what they've done.
[26:00.840 --> 26:05.280]  And so, but in this particular context, Jones has produced more discovery than anybody.
[26:05.280 --> 26:08.680]  I can't find anyone that's produced more discovery than he is and yet, they pretended
[26:08.680 --> 26:09.680]  that he didn't.
[26:09.680 --> 26:10.800]  Why?
[26:10.800 --> 26:13.800]  Because they built their whole case on a big lie.
[26:13.800 --> 26:17.520]  Alex Jones didn't initiate and instigate any of this, number one.
[26:17.520 --> 26:22.280]  And number two, their big lie was that Alex Jones became famous and made his money because
[26:22.280 --> 26:25.480]  he lied about this, totally and utterly false.
[26:25.480 --> 26:30.200]  So what do you do when you know the evidence is going to disprove your theory?
[26:30.200 --> 26:33.440]  The financial evidence and documentary evidence and the email evidence.
[26:33.440 --> 26:38.160]  Well, you pretend it existed, but Alex Jones must have secretly destroyed it.
[26:38.160 --> 26:40.200]  That's why they had to go this path.
[26:40.200 --> 26:42.400]  Their whole case was built on a lie.
[26:42.400 --> 26:47.520]  The judges knew it and the judges in order to cover up that lie needed to facilitate
[26:47.520 --> 26:54.880]  it and promote it by pretending he destroyed documents he never did.
[26:54.880 --> 26:58.960]  He was in fact deposed and he was deposed time and time again.
[26:58.960 --> 26:59.960]  Exactly.
[26:59.960 --> 27:00.960]  Many, many times.
[27:00.960 --> 27:03.840]  I think he sat for like eight days or something and that doesn't include everybody else for
[27:03.840 --> 27:04.840]  info wars.
[27:04.840 --> 27:10.160]  He sat for day after day after day after day after day after day of deposition.
[27:10.160 --> 27:12.880]  They turned over emails that they shouldn't even had to turn over.
[27:12.880 --> 27:18.400]  They were sent emails in their spam email where someone was trying to plant child CP
[27:18.400 --> 27:23.480]  on their computer system and because they turned over all of their emails, anything they'd
[27:23.480 --> 27:27.520]  never got, even if they'd never read it, then they were accused by the plaintiff's lawyers
[27:27.520 --> 27:30.560]  of sending CP to the families.
[27:30.560 --> 27:31.560]  Utterly false.
[27:31.560 --> 27:35.040]  Another big fat lie by the lawyers in the media.
[27:35.040 --> 27:39.940]  That's how much he turned over and like when you dig down and try to get to what exactly
[27:39.940 --> 27:42.880]  it was he didn't turn over, it ends up being very weak.
[27:42.880 --> 27:44.800]  And by the way, that's not the default staters in America.
[27:44.800 --> 27:50.200]  I have never seen a default judgment issued in America on these grounds ever.
[27:50.200 --> 27:53.640]  It's supposed to be specific to the specific fact that wasn't turned over.
[27:53.640 --> 27:58.680]  That issue can be, if they weren't able to independently acquire the evidence, that fact
[27:58.680 --> 27:59.840]  can be admitted against them.
[27:59.840 --> 28:01.440]  That's not what this judge has done.
[28:01.440 --> 28:06.720]  This judge has not allowed him to defend himself on the substantive merits based on a made-up
[28:06.720 --> 28:11.000]  theory of the plaintiff's lawyers that the judges knew was false, had reason to know
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.000]  was false.
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.320]  And in order to cover it up and punish and prosecute Alex Jones, they need to do this.
[28:15.320 --> 28:18.520]  And by the way, everybody, people might say, why should I care?
[28:18.520 --> 28:23.040]  Alex Jones admits he made mistakes about his Sandy Hook reporting.
[28:23.040 --> 28:27.440]  Maybe these people out there don't like Alex Jones because folks, the same reason we talked
[28:27.440 --> 28:30.920]  about it in 2018 when they banned him from all the social media.
[28:30.920 --> 28:37.160]  We said, this is a template, Alex Jones is the example, and they're coming for you next.
[28:37.160 --> 28:41.440]  And the legal theory they got approved in this case is that if you say anything that
[28:41.440 --> 28:45.480]  the government doesn't agree with, that somebody else feels emotionally offended by, they can
[28:45.480 --> 28:47.160]  now sue you into bankruptcy.
[28:47.160 --> 28:50.760]  And if Alex Jones is any example, you won't even get to defend yourself on the merits
[28:50.760 --> 28:52.160]  in front of a trial by jury.
[28:52.160 --> 28:53.520]  It's very important, folks.
[28:53.520 --> 28:55.760]  Remember, Alex Jones was a test case for censorship.
[28:55.760 --> 28:57.360]  They censored the president after that.
[28:57.360 --> 29:00.760]  This is another test case.

[30:00.000 --> 30:05.400]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual
[30:05.400 --> 30:07.560]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages.
[30:07.560 --> 30:09.960]  And the studies are all clear.
[30:09.960 --> 30:16.360]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom.
[30:16.360 --> 30:20.320]  And the number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[30:20.320 --> 30:24.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.440]  having lasting good, loving relationships.
[30:26.440 --> 30:27.840]  They want to break up society.
[30:27.840 --> 30:35.200]  And we are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world

[32:05.440 --> 32:08.680]  member series, George Washington slaying the dragon.
[32:08.680 --> 32:12.960]  Then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin and finally the second amendment, come and
[32:12.960 --> 32:14.960]  take it, Molan Lobby coin.
[32:14.960 --> 32:24.520]  There are only 75 coins left in the three-coin series, exclusively right now at 1776point.com.

[33:01.120 --> 33:12.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:12.800 --> 33:25.040]  Broadcasting live from the U.N. stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex
[33:25.040 --> 33:28.960]  Jones show and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[33:28.960 --> 33:35.440]  You know the media likes to attack Alex Jones and they show you a portrait of Alex with
[33:35.440 --> 33:37.800]  his head on fire.
[33:37.800 --> 33:46.360]  Like, oh wow, you know, he must be crazy because he's passionate and rambunctious about the
[33:46.360 --> 33:48.720]  issues and the topics he covers.
[33:48.720 --> 33:57.960]  Like for example, when Alex Jones is covering free speech issues in the digital marketplace,
[33:57.960 --> 34:05.280]  yeah, Alex's head is on fire or at least you might think listening because he understood
[34:05.280 --> 34:11.240]  it before most others, the implications of censorship on the Internet.
[34:11.240 --> 34:18.600]  He understood that if it was going to be Alex Jones, that was the test case, that it would
[34:18.600 --> 34:25.120]  only be the beginning and so he was up here as a firebrand saying, if they censor me,
[34:25.120 --> 34:30.480]  they censor you next and then they censored him and there was barely any backlash.
[34:30.480 --> 34:35.200]  In fact, even most Republicans supported it, including on Fox News, who have an issue with
[34:35.200 --> 34:41.960]  censorship now, unironically, but you see, we understood Alex was the test case then
[34:41.960 --> 34:43.320]  for censorship on the Internet.
[34:43.320 --> 34:46.680]  Now you see where we're at four years later.
[34:46.680 --> 34:50.760]  Even the president of the United States gets censored, Congress members get censored, everybody
[34:50.760 --> 34:52.200]  getting censored.
[34:52.200 --> 34:56.880]  This case that Alex is going through now is the next test case.
[34:56.880 --> 35:01.960]  So just like we were all Alex Jones dealing with Internet censorship, now we're all Alex
[35:01.960 --> 35:08.600]  Jones dealing with free speech rights and really just basic legal principles and justice
[35:08.600 --> 35:14.280]  in a courtroom, so everybody should be concerned about this case more from the legal experts
[35:14.280 --> 35:16.560]  on why.
[35:16.560 --> 35:17.640]  People have to appreciate that.
[35:17.640 --> 35:23.480]  He's been foreclosed from pleading on the basis of default for failure to produce documents,
[35:23.480 --> 35:24.480]  whatever.
[35:24.480 --> 35:29.000]  He's been deposed multiple times and again, everybody, this is not to defend Alex Jones.
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.360]  This is to defend the process that needs to be respected in order for there to be justice
[35:33.360 --> 35:39.560]  and not literally judgments in the absence of defense because that's not a system anymore.
[35:39.560 --> 35:44.360]  That's just an execution and Alex Jones admitted that he said things that were wrong.
[35:44.360 --> 35:49.440]  I brought up one chat, which is actually, I think quite on point, winning reality says
[35:49.440 --> 35:53.040]  Alex was set up yet the disinformation was calculated and organized.
[35:53.040 --> 35:54.720]  The calls were mostly strategy.
[35:54.720 --> 35:57.280]  They pulled him in the direction they wanted him to go.
[35:57.280 --> 36:02.240]  Alex got so big, he disconnected from his face, maybe not that, but the idea that, look,
[36:02.240 --> 36:07.680]  we know how agitators can work, how, as Jean Provocateur can work, knowing what they wanted
[36:07.680 --> 36:10.040]  to do, get someone to call in, get them to run with it.
[36:10.040 --> 36:14.800]  You get the sound bite and you get Alex Jones saying something like crisis actors, which
[36:14.800 --> 36:20.320]  would imply that their kids were not actually killed or that they're acting.
[36:20.320 --> 36:21.320]  That's distressing.
[36:21.320 --> 36:23.280]  I'd appreciate that that's distressing.
[36:23.280 --> 36:25.840]  What would be the defenses I'd like to hear on the merits?
[36:25.840 --> 36:27.640]  What would be the quantum of the damages?
[36:27.640 --> 36:31.760]  It has to be realistically correlated to what's going on.
[36:31.760 --> 36:37.640]  Is the distressing part that somebody you're going to call a kook or a wacko says you're
[36:37.640 --> 36:41.920]  crisis actors and not the fact that your actual child was killed in this incident?
[36:41.920 --> 36:44.880]  Put a quantum on it, but there has to be a process that has to be respected.
[36:44.880 --> 36:47.880]  And if it's not respected, you no longer have a judicial system.
[36:47.880 --> 36:53.320]  You just have show trials like we saw with Steve Bannon.
[36:53.320 --> 36:54.320]  Exactly.
[36:54.320 --> 36:57.280]  Well, that may be a good bridge into Bannon.
[36:57.280 --> 36:58.480]  So the trial happened this week.
[36:58.480 --> 36:59.680]  He was here to cover it.
[36:59.680 --> 37:03.360]  I may be in and out of the courtroom, depending on circumstances.
[37:03.360 --> 37:08.080]  Again, I'm not official counsel of record for the Connecticut lawyers and others that
[37:08.080 --> 37:12.920]  may be listening out there, but I'm not going to be silenced just because they would like
[37:12.920 --> 37:13.920]  me to be.
[37:13.920 --> 37:14.920]  Now, who knows?
[37:14.920 --> 37:17.360]  These judges are capable of crazy things.
[37:17.360 --> 37:18.360]  They try crazy things.
[37:18.360 --> 37:22.080]  I will seek my relief and remedy accordingly.
[37:22.080 --> 37:26.640]  But it's a sign of where we are or act, and more people should be more concerned with
[37:26.640 --> 37:30.600]  this case, regardless of what they think about Sadie Hook, regardless of what they think
[37:30.600 --> 37:37.480]  about Alex Jones, because this is about the American judicial system looking like an embarrassment,
[37:37.480 --> 37:42.320]  just like the January 6 cases and as a good bridge, just like the disgrace of a case that
[37:42.320 --> 37:44.040]  was the Steve Bannon trial.
[37:44.040 --> 37:49.440]  And just one thing before we get there, Robert, the idea that a lot of people have never heard
[37:49.440 --> 37:54.160]  of Alex Jones until Sandy Hook, a lot of people in the mainstream did it.
[37:54.160 --> 37:58.680]  And I remember I only knew vaguely of Alex Jones because Howard Stern made fun of him
[37:58.680 --> 37:59.880]  from time to time.
[37:59.880 --> 38:04.280]  So at the time of Sandy Hook, I do remember what Alex Jones was saying, talking about
[38:04.280 --> 38:05.280]  a hoax.
[38:05.280 --> 38:10.360]  They were walking around the school as if it was a drill, floating the idea, entertaining
[38:10.360 --> 38:13.120]  a caller, talking about crisis actors.
[38:13.120 --> 38:17.360]  People were saying there were lies about Sandy Hook.
[38:17.360 --> 38:24.160]  I'll go with the plausible scenario now that we've lived through a uvaldi, that maybe the
[38:24.160 --> 38:27.360]  reason why they rushed to destroy the school was to hide the fact that it didn't have
[38:27.360 --> 38:28.680]  basic safety protocol.
[38:28.680 --> 38:33.280]  I can appreciate that argument, which some people might call conspiracy theory and others
[38:33.280 --> 38:36.400]  might just call liability theory.
[38:36.400 --> 38:40.320]  But most people didn't know about Alex Jones in the mainstream until this.
[38:40.320 --> 38:43.840]  They put him in the crosshairs and they're making an example of him, and the question
[38:43.840 --> 38:49.800]  is, Robert, what do you think is reasonable that can be expected by way of any condemnation
[38:49.800 --> 38:50.800]  for the quantum?
[38:50.800 --> 38:55.040]  Well, I see it as a threefold question because one is, the statute of limitations should
[38:55.040 --> 38:59.840]  have barred these claims, Texas law requires you to make a correction or a retraction request
[38:59.840 --> 39:02.240]  before suit that didn't happen here.
[39:02.240 --> 39:04.680]  So procedurally, this case never should have been brought, period.
[39:04.680 --> 39:07.200]  It should have been dismissed right out of the gate.
[39:07.200 --> 39:12.120]  Secondly, the constitutional requirement of colloquium means that you have to make a specific
[39:12.120 --> 39:15.720]  factual statement about a specifically identified individual.
[39:15.720 --> 39:20.360]  Now sometimes you can identify that individual by image or by association rather than by
[39:20.360 --> 39:25.480]  name, but here there are too many people involved for someone to be, for them to know that it
[39:25.480 --> 39:27.200]  was about that person.
[39:27.200 --> 39:29.800]  Third, it has to be credible.
[39:29.800 --> 39:34.720]  So historically, it was your friends or others have to believe it's true about you or it
[39:34.720 --> 39:36.600]  doesn't function as defamation.
[39:36.600 --> 39:38.200]  It doesn't impact your character.
[39:38.200 --> 39:40.520]  Here, there's no evidence that happened at all.
[39:40.520 --> 39:44.080]  There's no evidence that anybody in their community really believed that they were not
[39:44.080 --> 39:45.080]  real.
[39:45.080 --> 39:49.080]  And in fact, the very nature of saying someone's not real is not necessarily attacking that
[39:49.080 --> 39:52.080]  person because you're saying they're not real in the first place.
[39:52.080 --> 39:53.800]  You're saying that's somebody else up there.
[39:53.800 --> 39:58.320]  So this does not fit the definition of defamation procedurally and never should have been allowed
[39:58.320 --> 40:00.400]  under the law.
[40:00.400 --> 40:03.960]  And constitutionally, it didn't meet the standard under the First Amendment right to protection
[40:03.960 --> 40:05.840]  of freedom of speech and the press.
[40:05.840 --> 40:06.840]  And I agree.
[40:06.840 --> 40:12.840]  The real story here was the reason why so many people were suspicious about what happened
[40:12.840 --> 40:18.000]  was in part because the Obama administration chose to politically weaponize it and politicize
[40:18.000 --> 40:19.000]  it.
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.880]  They said that people connected to them said they were going to stand on the literally
[40:22.880 --> 40:27.120]  said they're going to stand on the graves of these dead kids to get gun control in America
[40:27.120 --> 40:29.120]  to strip people of their Second Amendment rights.
[40:29.120 --> 40:32.680]  That led to a lot of people being suspect because of the history of government false
[40:32.680 --> 40:35.520]  flags when they try to take away people's rights.
[40:35.520 --> 40:39.800]  And the other aspect was the very peculiar behavior of the politicians in Connecticut
[40:39.800 --> 40:43.360]  who were hiding information from their sunshine laws.
[40:43.360 --> 40:50.040]  It turned out what they were hiding was pertinent to Uvaldi in that because if the truth had
[40:50.040 --> 40:55.080]  come out, the politicians would have been would have been properly judged and school
[40:55.080 --> 40:58.160]  safety would have dramatically improved in America.
[40:58.160 --> 41:00.920]  But gun control would have failed as an agenda.
[41:00.920 --> 41:07.680]  So they were willing to sacrifice more kids' lives to get gun control in America.
[41:07.680 --> 41:09.600]  And because what was it they didn't do?
[41:09.600 --> 41:15.120]  They didn't have a basic mechanism to lock the doors from the inside.
[41:15.120 --> 41:20.440]  And because they couldn't, I mean, they found the kids stacked up in bathrooms, folks.
[41:20.440 --> 41:25.160]  These kids would not have been dead had they had basic safety mechanisms in place.
[41:25.160 --> 41:27.800]  The school politicians and they got away with it.
[41:27.800 --> 41:30.640]  And they got away with it because the courts let them get away with it.
[41:30.640 --> 41:34.080]  They got away with it because the Obama administration let them get away with it.
[41:34.080 --> 41:37.400]  They got away with it because the media let them get away with it.
[41:37.400 --> 41:43.400]  And part of this whole case is to blame Alex Jones for Sandy Hook when it was the school
[41:43.400 --> 41:49.000]  politicians who led to Sandy Hook happening at the scale it did and probably had something
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.480]  to do with Uvaldi.
[41:50.480 --> 41:55.000]  They didn't want people raising questions about school safety, didn't raise, but don't
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.820]  ask any questions about whether the politicians stuffed cash in their pockets rather than
[41:58.820 --> 42:01.680]  spend it on kid safety.
[42:01.680 --> 42:04.480]  They didn't want to ask questions about police response times.
[42:04.480 --> 42:06.560]  They didn't want questions about Big Pharma.
[42:06.560 --> 42:10.440]  They didn't want questions about the kid who committed the shooting about his poor mental
[42:10.440 --> 42:11.560]  health treatment.
[42:11.560 --> 42:16.280]  They didn't want questions about being able to have guns like the person in Indiana, constitutional
[42:16.280 --> 42:17.280]  carry.
[42:17.280 --> 42:19.720]  And he had Kyle Rittenhouse level accuracy.
[42:19.720 --> 42:24.480]  And that's why a lot of lives are alive today in Indiana because he exercised that constitutional
[42:24.480 --> 42:29.440]  right to carry and took that guy out with some of the best shooting anybody seen since
[42:29.440 --> 42:30.440]  Kyle Rittenhouse.
[42:30.440 --> 42:37.360]  Fifteen seconds, 40 to 15 meters away with a hand held pistol and the CNN ran the headline
[42:37.360 --> 42:40.800]  an armed pedestrian and not a damn hero.
[42:40.800 --> 42:41.800]  But okay.
[42:41.800 --> 42:42.800]  Exactly.
[42:42.800 --> 42:47.440]  So that I mean, that's why we're at or this is a scary show trial in America.
[42:47.440 --> 42:52.360]  It makes the Chicago seven trial look like an icon of judicial ethics.
[42:52.360 --> 42:55.960]  We all knew our government, we all knew politicians were corrupt.
[42:55.960 --> 43:02.880]  But we're really seeing how bad it is now sold out for seven months.
[43:02.880 --> 43:06.880]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula is back in stock.
[43:06.880 --> 43:12.880]  Turmeric's been known for thousands of years to do amazing things for joints, stamina, immune
[43:12.880 --> 43:19.280]  system, and look, the average type of the shelves is five, six, seven percent pure humanoid.
[43:19.280 --> 43:22.400]  We have the strongest brand on earth.
[43:22.400 --> 43:28.280]  Nobody else decided to do it at 95 percent humanoid at infowarstore.com.
[43:28.280 --> 43:35.560]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula, 95 percent humanoid, it is incredible and what's even
[43:35.560 --> 43:38.280]  more incredible is it funds the info war.
[43:38.280 --> 43:44.000]  So the only way you fail is not taking action today and ordering body's ultimate turmeric
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.400]  formula at infowarstore.com.
[43:46.400 --> 43:48.600]  It is simply amazing.
[43:48.600 --> 43:56.480]  Remember the power of human oids at 95 percent at infowarstore.com today with body's ultimate
[43:56.480 --> 44:00.000]  turmeric formula.
[44:00.000 --> 44:04.680]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support info wars and
[44:04.680 --> 44:05.680]  band.video.
[44:05.680 --> 44:08.480]  You know, the Bible says let another mouth praise you.
[44:08.480 --> 44:09.840]  I'm going to do that right now.
[44:09.840 --> 44:16.080]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry, you guys have no idea how many people
[44:16.080 --> 44:21.200]  have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez, how many people have just been put on a launch
[44:21.200 --> 44:25.080]  pad, the outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[44:25.080 --> 44:29.600]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform and
[44:29.600 --> 44:33.600]  I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[44:33.600 --> 44:38.440]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cast, the super
[44:38.440 --> 44:39.440]  Tim Cast IRL.
[44:39.440 --> 44:45.440]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and band.video for granted because you
[44:45.440 --> 44:47.640]  don't know what you have until it's gone.
[44:47.640 --> 44:52.360]  We need to support free speech systems right now, so go check out the store, go support
[44:52.360 --> 44:56.760]  their store, go support info wars, leave a donation right now, don't wait until they're
[44:56.760 --> 44:57.760]  gone.
[44:57.760 --> 45:16.280]  Here's a man who can show you Triple 8 25 33139, Triple 8 25 33139, Triple 8 25 33139,
[45:16.280 --> 45:28.880]  Triple 8 25 33139, is the info wars store hotline one.
[45:28.880 --> 45:39.920]  Triple 8 25 33139, is the info wars store hotline one.
[45:39.920 --> 46:05.840]  We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what
[46:05.840 --> 46:08.240]  we've known and what's to come.
[46:08.240 --> 46:13.520]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is, don't panic.
[46:13.520 --> 46:18.840]  Stay calm, because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto
[46:18.840 --> 46:21.080]  a safe sound course.
[46:21.080 --> 46:26.800]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building our own
[46:26.800 --> 46:27.920]  society.
[46:27.920 --> 46:33.480]  All we gotta do is survive the crash, and right now we still have time to prepare.
[46:33.480 --> 46:37.760]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[46:37.760 --> 46:44.080]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water, and survival gear to
[46:44.080 --> 46:46.520]  keep us strong and at the ready.
[46:46.520 --> 46:54.200]  Go to preparetoday.com for the essentials, storable foods, water filtration, first aid,
[46:54.200 --> 47:00.600]  power, and more at preparetoday.com.
[47:00.600 --> 47:16.360]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:16.360 --> 47:21.680]  So here's the new Democrat strategy.
[47:21.680 --> 47:28.760]  Declare somebody guilty in the court of public opinion, just in general, not even on the
[47:28.760 --> 47:31.720]  basics of a certain issue or topic.
[47:31.720 --> 47:36.200]  Just in general, this person is guilty in the court of public opinion.
[47:36.200 --> 47:40.480]  They're bad, they're guilty, and they run all their propaganda and they run all their
[47:40.480 --> 47:41.960]  hit pieces.
[47:41.960 --> 47:44.360]  You could say Alex Jones is an example.
[47:44.360 --> 47:46.440]  You could say Donald Trump is an example.
[47:46.440 --> 47:48.880]  You could say Steve Bannon, Roger Stone.
[47:48.880 --> 47:50.800]  You could show the examples.
[47:50.800 --> 47:55.040]  So they just declare you guilty, you're bad in the court of public opinion.
[47:55.040 --> 47:59.600]  And when they get you in a courtroom, they just say, oh, you're guilty.
[47:59.600 --> 48:00.600]  And that's the new process.
[48:00.600 --> 48:09.200]  So innocent until proven guilty, a cornerstone of our legal system, a cornerstone of justice
[48:09.200 --> 48:15.600]  in this country, innocent until proven guilty, is being thrown out the window now.
[48:15.600 --> 48:18.040]  And we all know why.
[48:18.040 --> 48:24.320]  So whether you love Alex Jones or you hate Alex Jones, if you don't understand the
[48:24.320 --> 48:31.800]  implications of saying innocent until proven guilty, no longer applies here, innocent until
[48:31.800 --> 48:39.640]  proven guilty, we're going to take that cornerstone out of our justice and legal system foundation.
[48:39.640 --> 48:45.280]  If you don't understand how that hurts you, if you don't understand how that goes beyond
[48:45.280 --> 48:50.920]  Alex Jones, whether you love him or hate him, then you have been blinded.
[48:50.920 --> 48:59.960]  You have been lobotomized and you have been propagandized into celebrating your own demise.
[48:59.960 --> 49:07.480]  And a lot of that goes on specifically in reference to liberals and Democrats.
[49:07.480 --> 49:10.720]  They celebrate getting rid of the First Amendment.
[49:10.720 --> 49:13.960]  They celebrate getting rid of the Second Amendment.
[49:13.960 --> 49:16.360]  And they don't even understand how they're celebrating their own demise.
[49:16.360 --> 49:18.720]  It's incredible levels of propaganda.
[49:18.720 --> 49:21.400]  And they just think, oh, we got Alex Jones.
[49:21.400 --> 49:22.760]  I got Alex Jones.
[49:22.760 --> 49:23.880]  Not even a victory for them.
[49:23.880 --> 49:24.880]  They don't know Alex Jones.
[49:24.880 --> 49:25.880]  They don't even listen to Alex Jones.
[49:25.880 --> 49:26.960]  They don't know anything about Alex Jones.
[49:26.960 --> 49:29.200]  But they just are told, Alex Jones is bad.
[49:29.200 --> 49:32.240]  And if we get Alex Jones, that's a victory for me.
[49:32.240 --> 49:37.000]  Even if I have to sacrifice my own prosperity, my own future, my own rights, I got Alex Jones,
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.280]  I feel accomplished.
[49:39.280 --> 49:42.800]  Not understanding how Alex's fate is their own fate.
[49:42.800 --> 49:49.080]  So we go back to the legal experts now again on why people should be concerned about this
[49:49.080 --> 49:50.960]  case.
[49:50.960 --> 49:58.080]  So I'm here to defend Alex Jones in the court of public opinion because I believe in him
[49:58.080 --> 50:04.440]  because Alex Jones is innocent of a lot of the claims that have been made against him.
[50:04.440 --> 50:09.560]  And when we get to damages, even if you say, OK, I think this case should still sort of
[50:09.560 --> 50:13.200]  gone on, I don't believe in the constitutional defense, I don't believe in the procedural
[50:13.200 --> 50:18.120]  defense, I don't believe in the statutory rights, OK, how much money is Alex Jones supposed
[50:18.120 --> 50:19.120]  to pay?
[50:19.120 --> 50:23.760]  Some of the people that are suing are not even related to people who died there.
[50:23.760 --> 50:27.140]  Is everybody supposed to just start getting big checks, big checks, even though they never
[50:27.140 --> 50:29.480]  complained at the time about Alex Jones?
[50:29.480 --> 50:32.520]  I mean, we kind of all know that these are fraudulent complaints.
[50:32.520 --> 50:35.720]  These people didn't suffer great emotional trauma because of what Alex Jones said they're
[50:35.720 --> 50:37.280]  lying about.
[50:37.280 --> 50:40.520]  And they think, I mean, I suffer a lot of tragedies in my lifetime.
[50:40.520 --> 50:41.520]  You know what?
[50:41.520 --> 50:44.760]  That doesn't give me a right to line my pockets with other people's money, and it doesn't
[50:44.760 --> 50:47.800]  give me the right to take away other people's rights.
[50:47.800 --> 50:52.080]  And everybody's scared because like, man, these people suffered a horrible trauma.
[50:52.080 --> 50:54.480]  Again, some of the people suing didn't.
[50:54.480 --> 50:58.720]  Some of them are just like FBI guys and what a crock.
[50:58.720 --> 51:01.920]  But for those that did suffer a horrible trauma, yeah, that's terrible.
[51:01.920 --> 51:05.160]  It doesn't give you the right to line your pockets with other people's money.
[51:05.160 --> 51:08.920]  For trauma, you know, you didn't really suffer because of what they said, and it doesn't
[51:08.920 --> 51:13.840]  give you or the right to take away other people's rights, the freedom of speech, freedom of
[51:13.840 --> 51:18.040]  the press, and the Second Amendment just because you don't like what happened.
[51:18.040 --> 51:24.320]  And so at some point trauma, this victim identification idea that, hey, I'm a victim.
[51:24.320 --> 51:25.880]  I'm now morally superior.
[51:25.880 --> 51:26.880]  I'm a victim.
[51:26.880 --> 51:30.000]  Now I get to dictate to everybody what's going to happen with their rights.
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.560]  Now I get to demand money from other people like reparations, like other things.
[51:33.560 --> 51:36.760]  I don't agree with that as a fundamental premise.
[51:36.760 --> 51:41.840]  And it's scared too many people off from defending Alex Jones in these cases because
[51:41.840 --> 51:46.120]  they're like, geez, I don't want to be on the side against the Sandy Hook parents.
[51:46.120 --> 51:48.520]  And I'm just, I'm tired of it, to be honest with you.
[51:48.520 --> 51:54.000]  No, no, and Robert, I can tell you like the pushback I got from even the prospect of having
[51:54.000 --> 52:00.560]  Alex Jones on for a sidebar with you, people, people just have a misconception of Alex
[52:00.560 --> 52:03.080]  Jones to begin with, but setting that aside.
[52:03.080 --> 52:08.360]  One thing I want to touch on, I remember at the time the parents who were suing and the
[52:08.360 --> 52:11.600]  plaintiffs who were suing said that they were receiving harassment.
[52:11.600 --> 52:17.360]  They were getting stalked and doxxed and harassed by people who were incited or influenced
[52:17.360 --> 52:21.080]  or motivated by Alex Jones' discourse.
[52:21.080 --> 52:24.920]  I remember hearing it at the time and just taking it for granted.
[52:24.920 --> 52:28.360]  But now I wonder in retrospect whether or not that was accurate.
[52:28.360 --> 52:31.320]  I've seen zero evidence of it, zero evidence.
[52:31.320 --> 52:35.480]  So like Megan Kelly once reported, it's in the new Alex's war documentary, which pretty
[52:35.480 --> 52:40.920]  solid documentary, which I saw this weekend at the premiere with Alex and some other folks.
[52:40.920 --> 52:46.360]  It's not a pro-Alex documentary, but it's a pretty reasonable one in terms of being balanced
[52:46.360 --> 52:47.480]  and appropriate.
[52:47.480 --> 52:51.880]  But in that documentary, it repeated what Megan Kelly had said, where a defense lawyer
[52:51.880 --> 52:58.360]  for someone had blamed Infowars for this person stalking, stalking somebody that was connected
[52:58.360 --> 53:00.960]  to Sandy Hook.
[53:00.960 --> 53:03.560]  Some is if you dig into the record, that wasn't really true.
[53:03.560 --> 53:07.240]  That was the defense lawyer looking for an excuse that he thought a liberal judge would
[53:07.240 --> 53:10.800]  buy to go down on sentencing.
[53:10.800 --> 53:13.080]  Infowars, how you would know that?
[53:13.080 --> 53:17.200]  Because if you actually followed and read Infowars at the time, you knew that Paul Joseph
[53:17.200 --> 53:21.400]  Watson, the editor of Infowars, was always critical of anybody who raised questions
[53:21.400 --> 53:22.720]  about Sandy Hook.
[53:22.720 --> 53:25.680]  You knew how often Infowars said Sandy Hook happened.
[53:25.680 --> 53:29.440]  You knew that through most of the time, period, Alex Jones always said Infowars that Sandy
[53:29.440 --> 53:30.520]  Hook happened.
[53:30.520 --> 53:36.240]  So you knew how that was an exceptional and occasional and rare and not customary opinion.
[53:36.240 --> 53:38.120]  So you knew that his people weren't behind any of it.
[53:38.120 --> 53:40.040]  And to my knowledge, wait for trial.
[53:40.040 --> 53:46.320]  My guess is they will not produce one person who will say that they did anything bad directly
[53:46.320 --> 53:50.240]  to the Sandy Hook people because of Alex Jones and Infowars.
[53:50.240 --> 53:52.160]  And they've had years to develop the evidence.
[53:52.160 --> 53:56.680]  Over 10 years now, there will be zero evidence to support that media myth.
[53:56.680 --> 53:59.280]  Rob, I want to bring up Little Rocks.
[53:59.280 --> 54:00.600]  Little Rock is an attorney people.
[54:00.600 --> 54:02.040]  Little Rock, hope you're doing well.
[54:02.040 --> 54:03.240]  Robert, you are fired up.
[54:03.240 --> 54:07.680]  I have been this way for a few years on other issues I've seen in the eighth circuit.
[54:07.680 --> 54:12.040]  If you can or have time, tell us why 80% of attorneys are Democrat.
[54:12.040 --> 54:13.040]  Yeah.
[54:13.040 --> 54:17.280]  I mean, I was talking to a friend of mine here in Austin about some cases of his that
[54:17.280 --> 54:18.280]  have gone crazy.
[54:18.280 --> 54:24.000]  And it's because the lawyers are overwhelmingly from the professional managerial class that
[54:24.000 --> 54:27.800]  thinks they're God's gift to the universe, that thinks they're here to tell you what
[54:27.800 --> 54:29.240]  to do in your life.
[54:29.240 --> 54:32.320]  That's how they handle their own cases and clients.
[54:32.320 --> 54:33.680]  And they think they're right.
[54:33.680 --> 54:35.960]  And they think they should govern the rest of us.
[54:35.960 --> 54:40.720]  It's just read Gorsuch's wonderful footnote in his concurring opinion in West Virginia
[54:40.720 --> 54:46.360]  versus EPA, where he describes this was Woodrow Wilson's mindset in the 19 teens.
[54:46.360 --> 54:51.160]  This has been the progressive so-called progressive movement was always a professional managerial
[54:51.160 --> 54:53.240]  class movement to govern the rest of us.
[54:53.240 --> 54:58.800]  And as Mark Grober recently pointed out on his answering questions about the JFK assassination
[54:58.800 --> 55:06.160]  with Eric Hunley on America's untold stories where you can find on YouTube and at unstructured.locals.com,
[55:06.160 --> 55:12.480]  where they put up a lot of inside information, text, a whole bunch of stuff.
[55:12.480 --> 55:13.480]  They're amazing.
[55:13.480 --> 55:14.480]  Everyone should check them out.
[55:14.480 --> 55:15.480]  Absolutely.
[55:15.480 --> 55:16.480]  Do great work.
[55:16.480 --> 55:21.160]  We will be live with them probably a week from Friday for the monthly Freeform Friday
[55:21.160 --> 55:26.240]  show that's always fun and educational, sometimes in surprising ways.
[55:26.240 --> 55:33.320]  But as he pointed out in Eisenhower's farewell address, one of the things he highlighted was
[55:33.320 --> 55:39.120]  not just the military industrial complex, but he said this new professional class managerial
[55:39.120 --> 55:44.640]  class running things is probably a problem because of how they will irrigate power to
[55:44.640 --> 55:46.240]  themselves for arrogance.
[55:46.240 --> 55:48.520]  That's how lawyers are taught and trained.
[55:48.520 --> 55:51.720]  That's the socioeconomic class that they currently occupy.
[55:51.720 --> 55:54.680]  That's the class that they come from overwhelmingly.
[55:54.680 --> 55:58.160]  Very few working-class kids go to law school these days.
[55:58.160 --> 56:04.640]  Those of us who are more populist or people-oriented or little d-democratic-oriented, unfortunately,
[56:04.640 --> 56:10.000]  we are the rare exception, as Little Rock mentions, in the practice and profession of
[56:10.000 --> 56:11.000]  law.
[56:11.000 --> 56:15.120]  That's why people like Alex Jones have such trouble even finding lawyers willing to defend
[56:15.120 --> 56:16.120]  him.
[56:16.120 --> 56:19.560]  I have been the only lawyer willing to defend him in the court of public opinion.
[56:19.560 --> 56:22.720]  I was doing it before I was his lawyer.
[56:22.720 --> 56:28.040]  I've done it after I was no longer his legal counsel in these cases.
[56:28.040 --> 56:33.640]  That's because he's right, and it's because America deserves better than what we're getting
[56:33.640 --> 56:35.800]  and because I believe in the rule of law.
[56:35.800 --> 56:40.600]  What we saw in the District of Columbia this week was not respect for the rule of law.
[56:40.600 --> 56:41.760]  All right.
[56:41.760 --> 56:42.920]  That's time for the segue.
[56:42.920 --> 56:43.920]  We've covered it.
[56:43.920 --> 56:45.440]  Stick around, people.
[56:45.440 --> 56:46.760]  One last question, Robert.
[56:46.760 --> 56:48.280]  He gets to appeal, obviously.
[56:48.280 --> 56:49.280]  Yes.
[56:49.280 --> 56:52.600]  The problem is they can often collect on judgments while the appeal is pending.
[56:52.600 --> 56:55.200]  They clearly want to go in and seize.
[56:55.200 --> 56:57.600]  They want to seize all of InfoWars and shut them down overnight.
[56:57.600 --> 56:58.600]  That's the goal here.
[56:58.600 --> 57:03.280]  They have a judge who completely disrespects the rule of law, so we'll likely try to accommodate
[57:03.280 --> 57:04.280]  that.
[57:04.280 --> 57:05.280]  Okay.
[57:05.280 --> 57:06.280]  All right.
[57:06.280 --> 57:07.280]  Now, let's do it.
[57:07.280 --> 57:12.000]  Now, why is it not considered a conflict of interest for lawyers to be the ones writing
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  and voting on law?
[57:13.000 --> 57:16.680]  Well, I think too many lawyers in Congress, too many lawyers in all these positions, and
[57:16.680 --> 57:18.800]  that's true like the UK, same problem.
[57:18.800 --> 57:24.080]  They used to have a bunch of labor party used to actually be laborers, coal miners and people
[57:24.080 --> 57:25.440]  like that.
[57:25.440 --> 57:26.440]  Go back to the 40s.
[57:26.440 --> 57:27.960]  Go back to the 50s in the UK.
[57:27.960 --> 57:29.520]  Now they don't exist.
[57:29.520 --> 57:33.240]  The labor party is a bunch of lawyers, and that's why they're a bunch of wokesters.
[57:33.240 --> 57:36.520]  This is a class of people we cannot allow to have power.
[57:36.520 --> 57:40.960]  Power should be dispersed amongst ordinary people who have a diverse set of life experiences,
[57:40.960 --> 57:50.880]  not a small professional managerial class that thinks they're God's gift to the world.
[57:50.880 --> 57:56.480]  Sold out for more than six months, our number one best seller is now back in stock.

[58:50.680 --> 58:56.080]  Seven months ago in December of 2021, we launched the first in the three coin founding member
[58:56.080 --> 58:59.520]  series, George Washington slaying the dragon.
[58:59.520 --> 59:03.280]  Then we launched the tree of liberty coin and finally the second amendment, come and
[59:03.280 --> 59:04.280]  take it.

[59:43.280 --> 59:49.360]  set exclusively available at 1776point.com.
[59:49.360 --> 59:59.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[59:59.360 --> 1:00:25.360]  So there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[1:00:25.360 --> 1:00:54.280]  All you have to do is check out what I'm saying and that's why they run the fake headline against
[1:00:54.280 --> 1:00:59.240]  myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere, every day.
[1:00:59.240 --> 1:01:05.120]  Jones admits he's an actor or Tucker Carlson says nobody would take me seriously.
[1:01:05.120 --> 1:01:06.120]  Where do we say that?
[1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:07.120]  We never said that.
[1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:09.680]  They just say we said that.
[1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:11.640]  But where's the clip?
[1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:12.640]  Where's the article?
[1:01:12.640 --> 1:01:13.640]  Where do we say that?
[1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:14.640]  It doesn't exist.
[1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:19.360]  Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist.
[1:01:19.360 --> 1:01:22.480]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show.
[1:01:22.480 --> 1:01:27.080]  The radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act.
[1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:29.200]  He's actually a performance artist.
[1:01:29.200 --> 1:01:30.720]  He's a performance artist.
[1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:32.720]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:39.320]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid and it's all based on a custody battle
[1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:43.320]  with my ex-wife five years ago when she was trying to put into evidence to be dressed
[1:01:43.320 --> 1:01:49.000]  up more than a decade before like the Joker being sarcastic saying take your Prozac kids,
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:55.080]  take your illegal drugs too, they'll die, it's fun, so people wouldn't take drugs.
[1:01:55.080 --> 1:01:56.280]  And they wanted to enter that in evidence.
[1:01:56.280 --> 1:01:59.080]  They look, he's insane telling kids to use drugs.
[1:01:59.080 --> 1:02:04.240]  And my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks that's
[1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:05.320]  really Jack Nicholson.
[1:02:05.320 --> 1:02:13.680]  So yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander, or Optimus Prime, or the Joker, because I can
[1:02:13.680 --> 1:02:18.880]  do imitations of them all really good, or Darth Vader, don't act so surprised globalist.
[1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:24.240]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:26.080]  Do I really think I'm Darth Vader?
[1:02:26.080 --> 1:02:27.080]  No.
[1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:28.080]  Do I think I'm Optimus Prime?
[1:02:28.080 --> 1:02:30.160]  I'm a commander, the Joker, no.
[1:02:30.160 --> 1:02:36.200]  And clearly no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire that what I'm saying
[1:02:36.200 --> 1:02:38.000]  is what I really think.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:39.800]  No one believes the Babylon Bee.
[1:02:39.800 --> 1:02:42.720]  It's not trying to lie to you, it's being sarcastic.
[1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:44.960]  By the vaccinate me Elmo doll today.
[1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:46.680]  It's required by the CDC.
[1:02:46.680 --> 1:02:51.760]  But they play those games, and that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to.
[1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:56.400]  Even though I tell people, okay, this is a joke, this isn't serious, they clip it out,
[1:02:56.400 --> 1:03:00.600]  and they say, no, this is what he really believes.
[1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:04.120]  Every day when I leave work, I do this, that man's a threat to this country.
[1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:06.680]  And they go, look, he admitted in court, he's an actor.
[1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:12.640]  Well yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly, I was an actor in Waking Life, I was an actor
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:16.160]  when I was Cobra Commander.
[1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:21.040]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host, up here reading news articles
[1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:24.600]  to you, isn't a real thing, and isn't something I'm actually saying.
[1:03:24.600 --> 1:03:25.600]  And you know that.
[1:03:25.600 --> 1:03:29.440]  You're insulted right now, I'm even explaining that to you, and so am I.
[1:03:29.440 --> 1:03:33.720]  But that's who these people are.
[1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:37.400]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[1:03:37.400 --> 1:03:39.640]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:45.400]  I think Alex Jones seems really talented, he's smart, he's funny as hell, he's truly
[1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:46.400]  funny.
[1:03:46.400 --> 1:03:55.400]  I'm kind of retarded.
[1:03:55.400 --> 1:04:01.600]  Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes, do you now not listen to what
[1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:06.560]  I say about other things when I show you a powerful news article by Dr. Joseph Mercola
[1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:12.600]  on infowars.com that has all the cited information, the latest tragedy, sudden adult death syndrome?
[1:04:12.600 --> 1:04:15.360]  No, that's a real thing.
[1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:18.440]  That's something happening in the real world.
[1:04:18.440 --> 1:04:21.120]  And that's what we're breaking down here today.
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:25.160]  I am Alex Jones, and I am the guy on this show every day.
[1:04:25.160 --> 1:04:30.160]  I am an American, and that's what I promote is freedom, and justice, and liberty, and
[1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:42.480]  they can't stand it.
[1:04:42.480 --> 1:04:59.120]  Pesky Earth Creatures.
[1:04:59.120 --> 1:05:04.680]  Sold out for more than six months, our number one bestseller is now back in stock.

[1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:14.640]  be.
[1:05:14.640 --> 1:05:17.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is our best selling product because people love it.
[1:05:17.320 --> 1:05:18.320]  We first launched it four years ago.
[1:05:18.320 --> 1:05:19.880]  I was like, okay, that's another item.
[1:05:19.880 --> 1:05:22.040]  It's high quality, vitamins, minerals, okay, great.
[1:05:22.040 --> 1:05:25.980]  People love it because it tastes great, and they see the results, and it funds the info
[1:05:25.980 --> 1:05:26.980]  war.
[1:05:26.980 --> 1:05:31.960]  So sold out for more than six months, vitamin mineral fusion is now back in stock for a
[1:05:31.960 --> 1:05:37.280]  limited time at infowars.com for 40% off because I want you to experience it.
[1:05:37.280 --> 1:05:38.280]  I want you to get it.
[1:05:38.280 --> 1:05:41.560]  I want to move it out the door, and hopefully get more in the future, but who knows, supply
[1:05:41.560 --> 1:05:43.960]  chain breakdowns, it may not happen.
[1:05:43.960 --> 1:05:50.000]  So get your vitamin mineral fusion at infowars.com today and keep info wars on the air.

[1:06:06.320 --> 1:06:09.520]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[1:06:09.520 --> 1:06:17.760]  It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer, and we've got Robert Barnes in studio with
[1:06:17.760 --> 1:06:18.760]  us now.
[1:06:18.760 --> 1:06:24.680]  We just heard from him on the Viva Free podcast, great legal breakdown.
[1:06:24.680 --> 1:06:29.240]  And in the next segment, what I want to do is kind of a simulation.
[1:06:29.240 --> 1:06:31.920]  Now Bob is not representing Alex in any cases.
[1:06:31.920 --> 1:06:33.120]  He's not legal counsel here.
[1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:40.600]  He's just here as just independent legal commentary, let's just say.
[1:06:40.600 --> 1:06:44.600]  And so I want to kind of do a simulation in the next segment of what would your opening
[1:06:44.600 --> 1:06:49.560]  statements be just as a lawyer that's neutral, not involved in this case.
[1:06:49.560 --> 1:06:58.200]  But before we do that, it's hard to really talk about the implications of this case,
[1:06:58.200 --> 1:06:59.200]  right?
[1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:00.200]  Because we're still in the present.
[1:07:00.200 --> 1:07:03.640]  I mean, we're still dealing with it now, just like when Alex was being censored.
[1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:06.560]  Yeah, we could talk about, we think they're going to censor the present next.
[1:07:06.560 --> 1:07:08.040]  They're going to censor members of Congress.
[1:07:08.040 --> 1:07:10.640]  But people didn't really believe those implications.
[1:07:10.640 --> 1:07:13.080]  They couldn't really see them coming.
[1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:14.600]  It's kind of a hard thing to foresight.
[1:07:14.600 --> 1:07:17.480]  But now we have a test case with the censorship.
[1:07:17.480 --> 1:07:20.680]  And I think a test case with what's going on in court.
[1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:27.000]  How do we properly lay out the implications of the results of this court case with Alex
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:32.720]  Jones, so that the American public doesn't get bamboozled into thinking, hey, if we
[1:07:32.720 --> 1:07:35.200]  get Alex Jones' scalp, that's a victory.
[1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:38.920]  But to understand, no, there's much bigger implications for the average American and
[1:07:38.920 --> 1:07:43.720]  for the country than just Alex Jones or Alex Jones-like people or supporters.
[1:07:43.720 --> 1:07:44.720]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:07:44.720 --> 1:07:48.600]  I mean, this case is about the power of the American judicial system to strip you of
[1:07:48.600 --> 1:07:52.800]  all of your core rights and liberties when somebody accuses you of doing something wrong.
[1:07:52.800 --> 1:07:56.320]  Because if they can do it to Alex Jones, just like what happened with social media,
[1:07:56.320 --> 1:07:58.040]  they can do it to you.
[1:07:58.040 --> 1:08:01.520]  And the goal is to prove that they can strip you of all of your rights of due process of
[1:08:01.520 --> 1:08:02.520]  law.
[1:08:02.520 --> 1:08:07.000]  Those rights include the rights to bring things like motions to dismiss, motions for anti-slap
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  motions, motions for summary judgment, your right to seek discovery, your right of privacy
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:14.400]  against invasive discovery.
[1:08:14.400 --> 1:08:18.360]  All of those rights have been violated in the case of Alex Jones and every court that
[1:08:18.360 --> 1:08:22.840]  has adjudicated these Sandy Hook cases, both in Austin, Texas and in Connecticut.
[1:08:22.840 --> 1:08:23.840]  But it's not just that.
[1:08:23.840 --> 1:08:27.320]  They've also stripped him of his right to appeal some of those rulings, a right to an
[1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:31.560]  appeal, an anti-slap motion in the case of Connecticut, a right to this appeal, a summary
[1:08:31.560 --> 1:08:33.920]  judgment motion in the case of Texas.
[1:08:33.920 --> 1:08:37.760]  Not only that, they've also now stripped him of his right to trial by jury.
[1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:43.160]  There's a reason why the Magna Carta's fundamental assertion, the most critical, essential procedural
[1:08:43.160 --> 1:08:49.120]  right to guarantee substantive freedoms and liberties, was the right to trial by jury.
[1:08:49.120 --> 1:08:50.120]  What has happened here?
[1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:55.240]  He is not allowed to have a right of trial by jury on the substantive merits of the suit.
[1:08:55.240 --> 1:08:59.240]  He is not even allowed to have a right of trial by jury on many issues that are legally
[1:08:59.240 --> 1:09:06.440]  related to whether or not he caused any damages to the people seeking relief in the court.
[1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:09.600]  And that's going to keep going further, as we probably will see in witness in the jury
[1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:10.960]  selection process.
[1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:15.600]  The court is likely to preclude and exclude those jurors who are capable of being impartial
[1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:21.280]  and try to stack the jury with prejudiced jurors who have a preconceived conclusion
[1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:24.480]  about the case further inflamed by the judge's ruling.
[1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:27.680]  So this is about, does the rule of law still govern in America?
[1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:29.960]  Do you still have a right of trial by jury?
[1:09:29.960 --> 1:09:32.000]  Do you have a right of due process of law?
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:33.840]  Do you have a right of privacy?
[1:09:33.840 --> 1:09:37.680]  Because if they stripped those rights from Alex Jones, you're next, just like happened
[1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:39.200]  in the social media context.
[1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:44.520]  Well, and I've seen what happens in the court of public opinion now with the power of the
[1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:47.520]  mainstream media, which is just totally allied with the Democrat Party.
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:50.160]  I mean, you want to talk about collusion, you want to talk about fascism, there it is,
[1:09:50.160 --> 1:09:54.240]  the media and the Democrat Party, where I have friends, and this is what I say is the
[1:09:54.240 --> 1:09:55.240]  power of it.
[1:09:55.240 --> 1:10:00.320]  I have friends that know me, have known me my entire life, and they'll find some media
[1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:04.480]  story about me, and if they even have the courage, they'll send it to me and say, hey,
[1:10:04.480 --> 1:10:05.480]  what's going on?
[1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:08.800]  But more often the case is they see it and they start talking with other people about
[1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:12.320]  how I'm bad and how I did this and they can't believe I would do this stuff.
[1:10:12.320 --> 1:10:14.360]  It's like, you know me.
[1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:17.120]  You know me, and they still fall for the propaganda.
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:19.880]  They still say, oh, wow, I'm sure I've known him my whole life.
[1:10:19.880 --> 1:10:20.880]  No, he's not this.
[1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:21.880]  No, he's not that.
[1:10:21.880 --> 1:10:24.840]  But oh my gosh, I just saw this hit piece and now everything changes my mind.
[1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:29.280]  So I've seen in real time how the court of public opinion can be swayed so easily with
[1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:31.400]  the propaganda media.
[1:10:31.400 --> 1:10:35.240]  But here's an example, and I think this is kind of a, it will tell us where we're at
[1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:38.920]  as far as how it impacts the legal system.
[1:10:38.920 --> 1:10:42.480]  Now this might be a stretch because the cases are obviously different, but I look at the
[1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:47.000]  O.J. Simpson trial, O.J. Simpson is still guilty in the court of public opinion.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  Yes.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  Still guilty.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:50.500]  He's not going to be found guilty in a court of law.
[1:10:50.500 --> 1:10:51.500]  Why?
[1:10:51.500 --> 1:10:56.880]  Because in that process, police planted evidence, tampered with the crime scene, and the judge
[1:10:56.880 --> 1:11:00.760]  said, look, I'm out like, that's it.
[1:11:00.760 --> 1:11:03.840]  He could be guilty as sin, but the fact that you tampered with evidence, the fact that
[1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:07.880]  you planted evidence, you tampered with the crime scene, I can't listen to anything.
[1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:09.040]  You can't be trusted.
[1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:10.040]  The case is done.
[1:11:10.040 --> 1:11:14.160]  O.J. Simpson guilty in the court of public opinion, but because of the way that the actual
[1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:20.000]  legal system works, and the prosecutors blew the case, the police blew the case, O.J.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  Simpson's walks.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:25.200]  So now I think we have kind of the different thing where they want to build the court of
[1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:30.520]  opinion of guilty against Alex Jones, but then in the process, doesn't even matter.
[1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:32.520]  Doesn't matter what they find in the process.
[1:11:32.520 --> 1:11:33.520]  He's guilty.
[1:11:33.520 --> 1:11:34.520]  We're going to rule him guilty.
[1:11:34.520 --> 1:11:37.240]  The decision is not whether he's innocent or guilty, but how guilty he is.
[1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:40.640]  Oh, completely, and that's why they have stripped him of his ability to defend himself.
[1:11:40.640 --> 1:11:42.960]  That's why they stripped him of all of his procedural remedies.
[1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:46.800]  That's why they don't want, I mean, imagine here you have an Austin Democratic liberal
[1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:47.800]  jury.
[1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:51.600]  That's Austin, Texas, very liberal jury pool, Connecticut, very liberal jury pool.
[1:11:51.600 --> 1:11:58.080]  The courts are so scared and terrified of an even a liberal Democratic jury hearing the
[1:11:58.080 --> 1:12:03.280]  actual evidence in the case that they are preventing Alex Jones from giving them any
[1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:08.120]  of that evidence, even making argument about it, even asking questions about it.
[1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:12.240]  So what's going to happen in this case is they're going to try to, they try to rig the
[1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:13.240]  jury pool.
[1:12:13.240 --> 1:12:17.280]  They're going to tell the jury, the only evidence the jury is going to be allowed to hear is
[1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:21.960]  the trauma of the plaintiff, trauma that doesn't relate to Alex Jones.
[1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:26.200]  But Alex Jones' lawyers will not even be allowed to ask them whether something else
[1:12:26.200 --> 1:12:30.400]  might have caused their trauma or whether or not many of these people have been all over
[1:12:30.400 --> 1:12:32.760]  TV news all over the place.
[1:12:32.760 --> 1:12:37.680]  So I mean, did public discussion of their name concern them when they were publicly
[1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:39.960]  disclosing their own name everywhere?
[1:12:39.960 --> 1:12:41.800]  But those questions can't even be asked.
[1:12:41.800 --> 1:12:45.640]  You can't ask the same honest questions you could in any other courtroom in America and
[1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:47.760]  any other comparable case in America.
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:50.200]  This is all unparalleled and unprecedented.
[1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:55.960]  There is no example of denying a party their ability to say, hey, I'm innocent, denying
[1:12:55.960 --> 1:13:01.440]  a party saying, hey, I didn't cause you those injuries, hey, I didn't intend any harm to
[1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:02.440]  you.
[1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:05.440]  I didn't do 90% of the things that you think I did.
[1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:09.200]  So I mean, for example, watch, in this trial, there will be no evidence, this is my prediction
[1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:14.280]  right now, there will be no evidence that anybody stalked or directly harassed any of
[1:13:14.280 --> 1:13:17.720]  these plaintiffs at the demand or request of Alex Jones.
[1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:20.440]  That will turn out to have been a huge lie.
[1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:22.880]  Well they don't want the world to know that's a huge lie.
[1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:23.880]  So what do they do?
[1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:25.960]  They don't allow Alex Jones to talk about it.
[1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:27.440]  They don't allow him to present evidence of it.
[1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:30.400]  They don't allow him to testimony in his own behalf on it.
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:34.800]  They don't allow his lawyers to even talk about it to the jury or ask questions of witnesses.
[1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:36.120]  This is a rigged trial.
[1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:40.440]  This is, I said it looks like 19th century Australia, all kangaroos and railroads.
[1:13:40.440 --> 1:13:44.040]  And that's precisely what this case looks like, and it is a disgrace to the rule of
[1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:45.040]  law.
[1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:48.200]  And people have asked, why do I speak out about it when I don't represent Info Wars?
[1:13:48.200 --> 1:13:49.560]  I don't represent Alex Jones.
[1:13:49.560 --> 1:13:52.000]  This is my own independent opinion on the subject.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:55.880]  It is because it is an outrage to the rule of law that should scare and terrify every
[1:13:55.880 --> 1:13:57.800]  American that this can happen.
[1:13:57.800 --> 1:14:01.920]  And we need to call it out in the court of a public opinion, expose it for the fraud
[1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:06.320]  on the law that it is, so that we ultimately maybe can get justice through the legislative
[1:14:06.320 --> 1:14:08.000]  process or the appellate process.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:11.960]  Well, and it's like a bait and switch, or like Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom
[1:14:11.960 --> 1:14:17.680]  when he has to take the gold, trinket out and put the bag on it, where it's like, okay,
[1:14:17.680 --> 1:14:22.560]  here's somebody that's suffering greatly because of the loss of life, suffering greatly because
[1:14:22.560 --> 1:14:26.080]  of a tragedy, and that's there on the podium, and you say, look, they're suffering.
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:27.640]  This is a horrible tragedy.
[1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:31.880]  But then you take that away and put Alex Jones there and say, see, Alex Jones is the reason
[1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:32.880]  you're suffering.
[1:14:32.880 --> 1:14:33.880]  Completely.
[1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:37.960]  And they're not even allowed to tell the jury maybe their suffering is due to the shooter.
[1:14:37.960 --> 1:14:40.600]  Maybe the suffering is due to school safety lapses.
[1:14:40.600 --> 1:14:45.040]  Maybe their suffering is due to politicians lying about those school safety lapses.
[1:14:45.040 --> 1:14:47.040]  They're not allowed to talk about any of that.
[1:14:47.040 --> 1:14:51.440]  They're only allowed to say, listen to my trauma, blame Alex Jones.
[1:14:51.440 --> 1:14:52.440]  That's it.
[1:14:52.440 --> 1:14:53.640]  They're not allowed to hear or see anything else.
[1:14:53.640 --> 1:14:57.320]  And this is after rigging everything else that goes into the case in terms of procedure,
[1:14:57.320 --> 1:15:01.000]  in terms of substantive law, in terms of jury selections.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:04.600]  And so, like, it wouldn't surprise me if you have a juror get up there and say, hold on
[1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:10.520]  a second, we're only here in order to judge, to award money for hurt feelings.
[1:15:10.520 --> 1:15:11.520]  That's it.
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:12.520]  That's nothing else.
[1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:17.360]  A juror who speaks like that is likely to get struck by this judge because the judge
[1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:20.240]  wants a jury that's preordained guilt.
[1:15:20.240 --> 1:15:26.040]  This is an inquisition, this is a true witch trial Salem style, except there is no substantive
[1:15:26.040 --> 1:15:29.160]  merits behind many of the allegations and accusations raised.
[1:15:29.160 --> 1:15:34.600]  Now, I do want to do a kind of simulation mock opening statement with Bob Barnes today,
[1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:38.600]  but I actually want to stick on that comment when we come back because the jury selection
[1:15:38.600 --> 1:15:43.800]  process here is obviously going to be extremely important, maybe even the most important part,
[1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:45.360]  quite frankly, considering how this is going to go.
[1:15:45.360 --> 1:15:49.280]  So Bob Barnes in studio with us, we're going to do a simulated opening statement from Bob
[1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:51.720]  Barnes, eventually with these with us here today, but let's come back and talk about
[1:15:51.720 --> 1:15:54.720]  the jury selection process because most people don't even understand how that works.
[1:15:54.720 --> 1:15:58.400]  So let's get into that.
[1:15:58.400 --> 1:16:05.400]  Sold out for seven months, body's ultimate turmeric formula is back in stock.

[1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:20.720]  are out there?

[1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:12.240]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:15.600]  You might not agree with everything, you might not agree with all our perspectives, but we
[1:19:15.600 --> 1:19:17.840]  cover all the information.
[1:19:17.840 --> 1:19:20.080]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[1:19:20.080 --> 1:19:21.600]  Thank you for that Ward.
[1:19:21.600 --> 1:19:25.880]  infowarstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, infowarstore.com is where to
[1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:26.880]  get them folks.
[1:19:26.880 --> 1:19:31.520]  We do have the best supplements, I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage
[1:19:31.520 --> 1:19:36.720]  and our information, we do the best with our supplements as well.
[1:19:36.720 --> 1:19:40.520]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula, folks, this is a joke.
[1:19:40.520 --> 1:19:43.760]  I mean, we're giving this thing away, it's 75 percent off.
[1:19:43.760 --> 1:19:46.320]  By the way, it works for me, in case you haven't noticed.
[1:19:46.320 --> 1:19:50.360]  The hair and beard formula is working for me.
[1:19:50.360 --> 1:19:52.640]  White well, I might add.
[1:19:52.640 --> 1:19:56.400]  White well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[1:19:56.400 --> 1:19:59.040]  I go and see him quite often now.
[1:19:59.040 --> 1:20:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:19.680]  All right, we're going to do a mock kind of simulated opening statement here with Bob
[1:20:19.680 --> 1:20:24.560]  Barnes as we continue on the Alex Jones show, but I want to stick with the process of jury
[1:20:24.560 --> 1:20:28.760]  selection, something a lot of Americans aren't really aware of.
[1:20:28.760 --> 1:20:30.880]  They don't understand how it goes down.
[1:20:30.880 --> 1:20:33.360]  They don't understand the importance, the implication.
[1:20:33.360 --> 1:20:38.000]  I just so happen to have worked for lawyers and been in jury selection process twice,
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:40.760]  so I kind of have an idea of what goes on.
[1:20:40.760 --> 1:20:46.360]  And for a lot of cases, jury selection really is the most important part of a case, and
[1:20:46.360 --> 1:20:52.200]  it might not seem that way, but really it is, especially with trial cases that end up with
[1:20:52.200 --> 1:20:55.600]  the jury verdict, which is what could be the case for Alex Jones here.
[1:20:55.600 --> 1:21:00.000]  So we're in the process of the jury selection right now, Bob.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:01.480]  Just kind of go through the basics.
[1:21:01.480 --> 1:21:08.600]  Just legal 101, what is the jury selection process like, and then why is it so important?
[1:21:08.600 --> 1:21:13.880]  Why do lawyers and judges really spend a lot of time making sure they get the jury selection
[1:21:13.880 --> 1:21:14.880]  process right?
[1:21:14.880 --> 1:21:18.960]  Well, it reflects an old principle that I like to say, which is motivation is the master
[1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:19.960]  of reason.
[1:21:19.960 --> 1:21:21.800]  Reason is not the master of motivation.
[1:21:21.800 --> 1:21:24.640]  What that means is if you want to improve your reasoning, shift your motivation.
[1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:28.000]  Theoretically, that's what we're taught as lawyers to do, though increasingly your
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:31.040]  woke crowd is not even capable of doing so.
[1:21:31.040 --> 1:21:32.040]  So what does that mean?
[1:21:32.040 --> 1:21:35.440]  It means jurors come in with preordained beliefs about your case.
[1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:38.680]  They often are not consciously aware of their own beliefs.
[1:21:38.680 --> 1:21:42.680]  Some are, and some will lie to get on the jury, as I think happened in the Steve Bannon trial
[1:21:42.680 --> 1:21:47.880]  and happened in the Roger Stone trial, but some just are not aware of their bias.
[1:21:47.880 --> 1:21:53.080]  It's like if you meet a certain kind of person, if you meet somebody that's a woke liberal
[1:21:53.080 --> 1:21:57.000]  on the issues related to this case, as an example, someone who hates guns, someone who
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:01.480]  believes second amendment shouldn't exist, someone who's got eight veto signs in their
[1:22:01.480 --> 1:22:06.680]  front yard, someone who believes that the speech should be restricted, someone who believes
[1:22:06.680 --> 1:22:11.760]  in safe spaces, your classic sort of COVID Karen kind of personality, that kind of person
[1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:14.160]  is not going to be an impartial jury.
[1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:17.920]  But they will often say they are, and some of them actually may think they will be.
[1:22:17.920 --> 1:22:22.360]  So that's the first reality, is that the jury is the one to make the decisions and jurors
[1:22:22.360 --> 1:22:26.800]  come in with preconceptions and preconceived biases that will often shape the case and
[1:22:26.800 --> 1:22:28.840]  they will filter evidence in accordance with it.
[1:22:28.840 --> 1:22:30.600]  I call it a memento memory.
[1:22:30.600 --> 1:22:34.600]  In other words, most jurors that walk in are like from the movie memento, they remember
[1:22:34.600 --> 1:22:37.320]  what they want to remember and they don't remember what they don't want to remember.
[1:22:37.320 --> 1:22:40.600]  It's like any political debate you've ever engaged in with anybody of the opposite side
[1:22:40.600 --> 1:22:42.080]  or opposite party.
[1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:43.080]  That's part one.
[1:22:43.080 --> 1:22:45.280]  Why do we have trial by jury in America?
[1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:48.480]  Because it was first established in the Magna Carta, it was an old principle, which is
[1:22:48.480 --> 1:22:54.360]  you should only be tried by the other members of your community who can fairly and fully
[1:22:54.360 --> 1:22:59.040]  assess what you've done, whether it was right or wrong and what injury it may have caused
[1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:01.680]  and what remedy is appropriate and proportionate.
[1:23:01.680 --> 1:23:03.280]  So that goes all the way back to the Magna Carta.
[1:23:03.280 --> 1:23:06.000]  It's in the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:09.840]  It's applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution,
[1:23:09.840 --> 1:23:14.400]  the Civil Rights Amendments and then the States have their own constitutional protections
[1:23:14.400 --> 1:23:17.960]  for trial by jury as both Connecticut and Texas do.
[1:23:17.960 --> 1:23:22.000]  And what it means is on any question that is about whether you were morally right, whether
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:27.040]  you caused injury, what the remedy for injury would be, a jury is supposed to decide that.
[1:23:27.040 --> 1:23:32.480]  Now historically in America, juries were allowed to decide sentences as well as whether somebody
[1:23:32.480 --> 1:23:33.480]  committed a crime.
[1:23:33.480 --> 1:23:37.720]  They're able to decide the law as well as the so-called facts.
[1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:42.680]  The court system has usurped that from the jury because leave it to the courts to say,
[1:23:42.680 --> 1:23:46.120]  ah, we think we should have that exclusive power, not the jury.
[1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:49.840]  And because the only party around to enforce the right to trial by jury are the courts
[1:23:49.840 --> 1:23:54.120]  themselves, surprise, surprise, courts decided to monopolize that part of the power, the
[1:23:54.120 --> 1:23:56.520]  power to determine law to themselves.
[1:23:56.520 --> 1:24:01.320]  So now in America, jurors only get to decide because of the court system the facts.
[1:24:01.320 --> 1:24:04.760]  But in the case of Alex Jones, they're not even being allowed to hear those facts in
[1:24:04.760 --> 1:24:06.480]  order to determine those facts.
[1:24:06.480 --> 1:24:12.080]  Now the other important part of jury selection is you're entitled to an impartial jury.
[1:24:12.080 --> 1:24:17.320]  So the jury's supposed to represent the venue that you're from, the community, a fair representation
[1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:19.440]  of the local communities, part one.
[1:24:19.440 --> 1:24:22.640]  Part two is they're supposed to be impartial.
[1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:26.560]  In other words, they don't come in with a preconceived bias in the case.
[1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:32.440]  The reality is very few jurors in America are even capable of being impartial in most politically
[1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:34.360]  motivated cases.
[1:24:34.360 --> 1:24:40.160]  And so in a case like this, the jurors preconceived political bias will heavily shape whether they
[1:24:40.160 --> 1:24:42.080]  can be impartial or not.
[1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:46.200]  The reality is even Alex Jones fans are actually much more capable of being impartial in this
[1:24:46.200 --> 1:24:49.680]  case because they're willing to see whether you did right or wrong, whether an injury
[1:24:49.680 --> 1:24:51.920]  happened and whether remedies appropriate.
[1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:53.520]  You're Alex Jones haters or not.
[1:24:53.520 --> 1:24:55.200]  They're not willing to listen to the evidence.
[1:24:55.200 --> 1:24:56.880]  They're not willing to judge it impartially.
[1:24:56.880 --> 1:25:00.280]  They're not willing to make a judgment consistent with the facts and the law.
[1:25:00.280 --> 1:25:06.360]  And so the hard part for Alex Jones lawyers in court today is can you find an impartial
[1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:11.600]  jury in Austin, Texas when there's been all this inflammatory, prejudicial coverage in
[1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:12.600]  the media?
[1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:17.320]  Because that's the other aspect that's important in your right to an impartial jury that's
[1:25:17.320 --> 1:25:22.400]  representative of the community includes your right to a jury that hasn't heard about the
[1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:26.600]  case outside of the case that has biased them in certain conclusions.
[1:25:26.600 --> 1:25:31.560]  And that is a critical and equally essential component of your right constitutional right
[1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:36.440]  to trial by jury, because in the end, it's constitutional democracy preserved.
[1:25:36.440 --> 1:25:40.720]  How do we best protect our freedoms and liberties to who do we give power to because that's
[1:25:40.720 --> 1:25:45.240]  what often a question is it who has a right to something it's who do we give power to
[1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:50.200]  do we give power to unelected judges, do we give power to elected judges, do we give power
[1:25:50.200 --> 1:25:56.280]  to appellate or Supreme Court or law or district court judges, do we give power to the executive
[1:25:56.280 --> 1:26:01.480]  branch, do we give power to the legislative branch or do we instead give power to 12 ordinary
[1:26:01.480 --> 1:26:06.280]  everyday people who will impartially judge the facts and morality of the case and come
[1:26:06.280 --> 1:26:09.200]  to a conclusion and judgment of the community.
[1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:14.080]  Our forefathers said the only people we could really trust to protect our freedom to protect
[1:26:14.080 --> 1:26:18.600]  our liberty is an impartial 12 members of our local community.
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:20.800]  That's why trial by jury is so essential.
[1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:22.360]  It's not just about this case.
[1:26:22.360 --> 1:26:24.320]  It's not just about future cases.
[1:26:24.320 --> 1:26:27.960]  It's about the future of freedom and liberty in America.
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:31.040]  And just kind of a practical example of this.
[1:26:31.040 --> 1:26:35.360]  When I first was selected for jury duty, it was a gentleman who got caught with, I think
[1:26:35.360 --> 1:26:39.000]  it was some crack cocaine or something in the streets of St. Louis.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:42.840]  And part of the question they asked me, they say, have you ever been arrested for a drug
[1:26:42.840 --> 1:26:43.840]  offense before?
[1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:47.120]  I said, yes, I was when I was younger in college.
[1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:49.520]  Immediately they don't want me on the case because they know I'm going to have a bias
[1:26:49.520 --> 1:26:51.360]  against police.
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:55.120]  They then did some follow-ups and I said, I'm against the war on drugs.
[1:26:55.120 --> 1:26:59.720]  I probably would let this guy walk even if he was found guilty, I said he shouldn't.
[1:26:59.720 --> 1:27:01.640]  So immediately I was struck from that jury.
[1:27:01.640 --> 1:27:05.640]  So that's kind of part of the process is, OK, well, this guy's got a bias maybe against
[1:27:05.640 --> 1:27:06.640]  police.
[1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:08.000]  This guy is against the war on drugs.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:09.840]  We don't want him on our jury.
[1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:13.760]  And then in the other case, it was a longer white collar crime.
[1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:15.400]  I think it was money laundering or something.
[1:27:15.400 --> 1:27:18.480]  And the lawyer that I was working for at the time was like, if you land on this jury,
[1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:19.840]  you're going to be for months.
[1:27:19.840 --> 1:27:21.280]  This case is going to go on forever.
[1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:25.400]  So he's like, you should probably just say the word jury nullification a couple of times.
[1:27:25.400 --> 1:27:27.920]  Just slide it in there and they won't put you on the jury.
[1:27:27.920 --> 1:27:28.920]  And they were right.
[1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:33.200]  And that's a good process because it is a way to get an impartial jury.
[1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:34.560]  That's just the way it goes.
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:37.360]  Now the one question I have here, and you can answer this quickly because I don't hear
[1:27:37.360 --> 1:27:42.480]  brought up often, but what about even the jury duty process?
[1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:45.200]  I mean, is there a chance that that could be rigged?
[1:27:45.200 --> 1:27:48.360]  Is there a chance like Bannon's case, Stone's case, or any other cases where they could
[1:27:48.360 --> 1:27:55.000]  make sure that even in the jury duty selection that they kind of even have a impartial just
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:56.600]  base to choose from?
[1:27:56.600 --> 1:27:57.920]  It happens all the time.
[1:27:57.920 --> 1:28:02.960]  So in the crack cocaine case, Mike, the temptation I would have to ask is how much crack was
[1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:03.960]  it?
[1:28:03.960 --> 1:28:04.960]  Was it like breakfast?
[1:28:04.960 --> 1:28:05.960]  Like Hunter Biden level?
[1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:07.480]  Is it breakfast for Hunter Biden?
[1:28:07.480 --> 1:28:08.480]  Was it lunch?
[1:28:08.480 --> 1:28:09.480]  Was it dinner?
[1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:10.480]  Was it dessert?
[1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:17.040]  No, I mean, there's a lot of ways jury selection can be tampered with or can be rigged, usually
[1:28:17.040 --> 1:28:18.040]  by the system.
[1:28:18.040 --> 1:28:20.680]  So one is who they subpoena, who they summons.
[1:28:20.680 --> 1:28:21.760]  Did they do it properly?
[1:28:21.760 --> 1:28:23.840]  Was it really representative of the community?
[1:28:23.840 --> 1:28:28.200]  There was a Lincoln lawyer, Amazon TV series show, and they portrayed a judge who was manipulating
[1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:30.000]  that part of the process.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:32.280]  Second part of the process is what questions they ask.
[1:28:32.280 --> 1:28:35.360]  A third part of the process, what questions they allow your lawyers to ask.
[1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:37.720]  A fourth side of the process is who do they strike for cause?
[1:28:37.720 --> 1:28:39.360]  Who do they not strike for cause?
[1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:42.520]  So there's a lot of different ways to rig a jury outcome.
[1:28:42.520 --> 1:28:46.120]  You don't have to read John Grisham's runaway jury to figure that out.
[1:28:46.120 --> 1:28:50.000]  Well John Grisham, a great author, one of the best to put these into books ever.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:51.280]  All right, Bob Barnes is with us.
[1:28:51.280 --> 1:28:55.320]  We're going to do a simulated opening statement from Bob Barnes when we come back.

[1:33:17.040 --> 1:33:32.640]  All right, Robert Barnes in the studio with us, I want to just do a simulation and just
[1:33:32.640 --> 1:33:37.560]  to be clear here, Robert Barnes is not representing Alex Jones in this case, he's not legally
[1:33:37.560 --> 1:33:42.760]  involved in this case at all, he's just simply doing legal commentary as a legal expert right
[1:33:42.760 --> 1:33:48.400]  now, and obviously just following the case in so many other cases, a great voice of reason
[1:33:48.400 --> 1:33:53.920]  to go to, so I just kind of want to do a simulated opening statement here from Bob Barnes on
[1:33:53.920 --> 1:34:00.880]  Alex Jones' case that begins this week, folks, I imagine the media coverage of this is going
[1:34:00.880 --> 1:34:04.720]  to be pretty crazy, we'll see when it really heats up, but I don't think they're going
[1:34:04.720 --> 1:34:07.840]  to just kind of put this as a side case, I think they're going to want to bring it to
[1:34:07.840 --> 1:34:13.720]  the fore whenever it's advantageous for them or they feel it's advantageous for them, but
[1:34:13.720 --> 1:34:19.280]  aside from that, let's go to Bob Barnes now, just a simulated opening statement, we're
[1:34:19.280 --> 1:34:24.400]  just doing legal commentary here, if Bob Barnes was representing Alex Jones, he's not, but
[1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:28.240]  if he was, Robert, what would be your opening statement?
[1:34:28.240 --> 1:34:34.080]  So in the defense of Alex Jones, the opening statement really is kind of simple and straightforward,
[1:34:34.080 --> 1:34:38.960]  why are the jurors there, the real reason, and what everybody really kind of wanted to
[1:34:38.960 --> 1:34:43.720]  know is what exactly happened in the case of Sandy Hook, and what jurors mostly don't
[1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:49.440]  know, what most ordinary people don't know is what happened in terms of the cover-up
[1:34:49.440 --> 1:34:54.160]  of Sandy Hook by politicians connected to Sandy Hook, and why people were suspicious
[1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:59.360]  of what was going on at Sandy Hook, the reason was because the school system had pocketed
[1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:04.320]  money meant for school safety, and in fact, they did not even have the mechanisms and
[1:35:04.320 --> 1:35:10.920]  means in place for the teachers to be able to lock their doors to prevent a shooter from
[1:35:10.920 --> 1:35:15.560]  coming in the room, or even coming into the bathroom where some of them within the classroom
[1:35:15.560 --> 1:35:20.640]  also didn't have a lock on the door where they could even try to keep the children safe.
[1:35:20.640 --> 1:35:25.240]  That big lie about the local politicians keeping the schools safe when they had not, when they
[1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:30.240]  had failed a fundamental test, was the number one thing the politicians in Sandy Hook had
[1:35:30.240 --> 1:35:36.600]  to cover up, and they had the willing complicity of the press, the willing complicity of the
[1:35:36.600 --> 1:35:42.280]  Obama White House, because they wanted to blame to all shift to the gun and the gun
[1:35:42.280 --> 1:35:48.520]  manufacturer and Second Amendment rights in America, that being the cause of the traumatic
[1:35:48.520 --> 1:35:53.960]  tragic death of these young children, rather than politicians pocketing money meant for
[1:35:53.960 --> 1:35:59.560]  school safety and failing to employ effective school safety mechanisms that would come to
[1:35:59.560 --> 1:36:04.840]  haunt Americans in other places all across the country because of those schools' lack
[1:36:04.840 --> 1:36:09.400]  of effective school safety systems in years to come, and because of it, they covered up
[1:36:09.400 --> 1:36:15.560]  information related to Open Records Act, Sunshine Laws, FOIA requests, etc., and that in turn
[1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:21.320]  triggered a lot of people's concerns and questions that led them down often the erroneous path
[1:36:21.320 --> 1:36:26.000]  as to what had happened in Sandy Hook. But people asking questions as to what was really
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:31.240]  going on and what really happened is something we should want to have happen in America.
[1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:37.720]  We shouldn't want to discourage and dissuade asking basic core questions about big public
[1:36:37.720 --> 1:36:42.600]  events that impact things as important as the school safety of young children.
[1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:47.320]  So why are we here in this case? We're here in this case because the objective is to blame
[1:36:47.320 --> 1:36:53.720]  Alex Jones for the horrifying tragedy and trauma that occurred in Sandy Hook. But Alex
[1:36:53.720 --> 1:36:58.480]  Jones wasn't the person who decided not to use school safety mechanisms effectively.
[1:36:58.480 --> 1:37:03.000]  Alex Jones isn't the person who decided not to lock the doors or even providing means
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:07.640]  to lock the doors for school children. Alex Jones isn't the one who failed to have an
[1:37:07.640 --> 1:37:12.760]  effective school safety response system or school safety personnel located at the scene.
[1:37:12.760 --> 1:37:21.120]  Alex Jones is not the one who pulled the trigger. Alex Jones was the one exposing questions
[1:37:21.120 --> 1:37:25.760]  about big pharma and poor mental health of young disturbed men in America. Alex Jones
[1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:30.480]  was the one talking about the glorification of violence in video games and in aspects
[1:37:30.480 --> 1:37:35.880]  of Hollywood that is meant to create these kind of problems rather than cure these kind
[1:37:35.880 --> 1:37:40.200]  of problems. Alex Jones is the one talking about the necessity for school safety to be
[1:37:40.200 --> 1:37:45.240]  real and meaningful and that often means having good people with guns available to defend
[1:37:45.240 --> 1:37:50.120]  against bad people with guns. Alex Jones raised questions. Some of his questions by his own
[1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:55.720]  acknowledgment, by his own admission, he didn't get right. Nobody is 100% right. But what
[1:37:55.720 --> 1:38:01.040]  Alex Jones didn't do is cause the death of these young children. What Alex Jones didn't
[1:38:01.040 --> 1:38:07.040]  do was fail to put basic school safety tests in place. What Alex Jones didn't do was many
[1:38:07.040 --> 1:38:12.320]  of the things that people have assumed he did or blamed him for. Alex Jones simply raised
[1:38:12.320 --> 1:38:16.600]  questions. And some of those questions were on the right track. And they were questions
[1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:20.800]  the press should have been asking but wasn't. Our politicians should have been asking but
[1:38:20.800 --> 1:38:26.240]  weren't. And our public was entitled to answers to but didn't get. And so instead they want
[1:38:26.240 --> 1:38:32.480]  you to say that because of the horrific tragedy that happened that day, just blame Alex Jones.
[1:38:32.480 --> 1:38:36.720]  Don't blame anybody else. Don't blame big pharma. Don't blame the media. Don't blame
[1:38:36.720 --> 1:38:41.120]  the school safety officials. Don't blame the politicians. Don't blame the people that
[1:38:41.120 --> 1:38:47.840]  are not treating our mental health of our young men well. Don't blame any of that. Instead
[1:38:47.840 --> 1:38:52.720]  just blame Alex Jones because he asked questions and some of the questions didn't turn out
[1:38:52.720 --> 1:38:57.600]  to be right. But some of them turned out to be very right. And that is why you're really
[1:38:57.600 --> 1:39:02.840]  here. And it's the attempt to say that any emotional trauma experienced by anybody connected
[1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:07.520]  to that tragedy is solely and wholly the fault of Alex Jones. When Alex Jones isn't the
[1:39:07.520 --> 1:39:12.080]  reason why that Sandy Hook happened. Just like Alex Jones isn't the real reason we're
[1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:17.320]  here. We're here because this case is about your right to ask questions, your right to
[1:39:17.320 --> 1:39:21.840]  demand answers, your right to get meaningful remedies. That's why we're really here. They
[1:39:21.840 --> 1:39:26.440]  want to deny you, the American people, the right to ask those questions. They want to
[1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:31.160]  deny you, the American people, the right to demand answers. They want to deny you, the
[1:39:31.160 --> 1:39:36.920]  American people, the means to be able to best protect our young children. And that's why
[1:39:36.920 --> 1:39:41.920]  we're here. So the only verdict is a verdict that affirms our right to ask questions, that
[1:39:41.920 --> 1:39:46.400]  affirms our right to demand answers, and that affirms the right to meaningful school safety
[1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:51.640]  protection in America. And that is not aided by suppressing those questions, censoring
[1:39:51.640 --> 1:39:56.440]  those answers, or putting Alex Jones in a permanent gag box. That is what the case is
[1:39:56.440 --> 1:40:00.720]  about. That's what you're being asked to decide. Do the thing that is right. Do the thing that
[1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:04.800]  is American. And that means a zero verdict against Alex Jones.
[1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:11.000]  Now let's think about the precedent that could be said here. Now, there might not be a law
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:16.840]  written, right? But, oh, Alex Jones questions major event. His entire life is destroyed.
[1:40:16.840 --> 1:40:20.480]  His company is destroyed. He's bankrupted. We all know the story. Well, guess what? You
[1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:24.200]  don't need to write a law for people to see that and say, boy, I'm not going to question
[1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:29.120]  anything. If they do that, they do that to Alex. But let's just take a look at recent
[1:40:29.120 --> 1:40:34.400]  history. Jussie Smollett fakes a hate crime. Well, are you allowed to question that? Or
[1:40:34.400 --> 1:40:39.160]  is that propaganda allowed to persist as fact, even though we all know it was fake? What
[1:40:39.160 --> 1:40:42.760]  about Russian collusion? Remember Russian collusion, Donald Trump, Russian collusion?
[1:40:42.760 --> 1:40:46.680]  Totally fake news, totally made up. Are you not allowed to question that so propaganda
[1:40:46.680 --> 1:40:51.800]  can become fact and influence policy? What about the Uvaldi shooting? We now know the
[1:40:51.800 --> 1:40:56.040]  cops stood down. It was a good guy with a gun that had to bring down the shooter and
[1:40:56.040 --> 1:41:00.160]  saved lives. What if you weren't able to question that? We wouldn't know about the horrific police
[1:41:00.160 --> 1:41:05.040]  response that day. What about the Hunter Biden laptop? They said, oh, that's not real. It's
[1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:09.560]  Russian misinformation. It's Russian propaganda. Don't look at that. Don't question that. The
[1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:13.800]  laptop was very real. So we have all this is just modern history. I mean, we're not even
[1:41:13.800 --> 1:41:20.320]  getting into the Gulf of Tonkin. Now there are false flags that have led to wars. I think
[1:41:20.320 --> 1:41:25.800]  the USS Liberty and it's just all these other incidents. So setting the precedent of someone
[1:41:25.800 --> 1:41:31.080]  gets to run propaganda, someone gets to run with a lie, you don't get to question it.
[1:41:31.080 --> 1:41:35.300]  And then that propaganda, that lie is able to influence policy, which is then able to
[1:41:35.300 --> 1:41:40.040]  influence permanent law. And it's all based off a false flag. It's all based off of a
[1:41:40.040 --> 1:41:44.840]  lie. So if they can set that precedent in this case, whether they have to write laws
[1:41:44.840 --> 1:41:50.720]  or not, there's going to be major impact when it comes to free speech and media coverage
[1:41:50.720 --> 1:41:55.760]  of big events in this country and quite frankly, the world, depending on how this case goes.
[1:41:55.760 --> 1:41:59.200]  Oh, absolutely. And for people to understand out there, just look at what the Texas Court
[1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:02.480]  of Appeals said. They said, and you look at some of the questions that Alex Jones has
[1:42:02.480 --> 1:42:08.040]  been asked, it's if you question any narrative approved by the government and anybody feels
[1:42:08.040 --> 1:42:14.040]  offended, has hurt feelings over your questioning the institutional narrative, they can now sue
[1:42:14.040 --> 1:42:20.040]  you into bankruptcy because they don't like your questions. And it is much more important
[1:42:20.040 --> 1:42:25.480]  to have the right to question than it is to preclude people from asking the wrong questions.
[1:42:25.480 --> 1:42:29.640]  And that's what this case is all about. Just because somebody doesn't get every question
[1:42:29.640 --> 1:42:35.120]  right, doesn't get every answer right is no reason is no justification to stop them from
[1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:39.320]  asking questions and demanding answers in the first place. For all the great historical
[1:42:39.320 --> 1:42:43.000]  reasons we know about, what if you couldn't ask about whether vaccines were really safe
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:47.400]  and effective? What if you couldn't ask about whether a war is really justified or necessary?
[1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:52.120]  We need these questions. We need Alex Joneses of the world asking those questions because
[1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:57.960]  we the American people demand answers and we're entitled to them.
[1:42:57.960 --> 1:43:04.160]  We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what
[1:43:04.160 --> 1:43:09.560]  we've known and what's to come. And right now, the most important thing to remember
[1:43:09.560 --> 1:43:16.200]  is don't panic. Stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer
[1:43:16.200 --> 1:43:22.320]  the ship onto a safe sound course. There is nothing stopping we the people from making
[1:43:22.320 --> 1:43:28.880]  our own rules and building our own society. All we got to do is survive the crash and
[1:43:28.880 --> 1:43:35.280]  right now we still have time to prepare. The world fiat currency system is racing towards
[1:43:35.280 --> 1:43:42.320]  zero. It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water and survival gear
[1:43:42.320 --> 1:43:49.320]  to keep us strong and at the ready. Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials, storeable
[1:43:49.320 --> 1:43:57.760]  foods, water filtration, first aid, power and more at preparedtoday.com.
[1:43:57.760 --> 1:44:02.440]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support Info Wars and
[1:44:02.440 --> 1:44:07.800]  Band.video. The Bible says, let another mouth praise you. I'm going to do that right now.
[1:44:07.800 --> 1:44:13.840]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry. You guys have no idea how many people
[1:44:13.840 --> 1:44:18.960]  have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez, how many people have just been put on a launch
[1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:23.720]  pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself. I've been given so many
[1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:28.160]  opportunities because of this man and because of this platform. And I would probably not
[1:44:28.160 --> 1:44:32.040]  even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones. I mean, I've been
[1:44:32.040 --> 1:44:38.040]  able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass IRL. Listen,
[1:44:38.040 --> 1:44:43.480]  what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and Band.video for granted because you don't
[1:44:43.480 --> 1:44:48.160]  know what you have until it's gone. We need to support free speech systems right now.
[1:44:48.160 --> 1:44:53.000]  So go check out the store, go support their store, go support Info Wars, leave a donation
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:59.040]  right now. Don't wait until they're gone.
[1:44:59.040 --> 1:45:03.080]  This night seemed to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on
[1:45:03.080 --> 1:45:08.400]  both at home and the world at large. If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep
[1:45:08.400 --> 1:45:14.920]  we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula down and out is just the thing. It's

[1:45:35.680 --> 1:45:41.240]  you even take it. One of the other sleep support herbs included is the Passion Flour, which
[1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:46.720]  was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing
[1:45:46.720 --> 1:45:51.600]  qualities. Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because

[1:46:58.800 --> 1:47:07.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:07.800 --> 1:47:20.960]  All right, final segment here with Bob Barnes, who is going to be covering this trial as
[1:47:20.960 --> 1:47:27.200]  it's ongoing. It could last weeks. Who knows how long it could go, folks. A lot of stuff.
[1:47:27.200 --> 1:47:31.320]  We're just beginning the process now. And again, to clarify, Bob Barnes not representing
[1:47:31.320 --> 1:47:38.320]  us. He's just here as his own legal commentator, and he hosts podcasts and stuff as well. But
[1:47:38.320 --> 1:47:44.640]  let's kind of get into the defamation angle of this, not even necessarily directly involved
[1:47:44.640 --> 1:47:51.120]  with the Jones case here, but just as a more general coverage of defamation, because I've
[1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:56.960]  looked into this. When I had to get my degree in media, actually the hardest college class
[1:47:56.960 --> 1:48:00.400]  ever took was media law. I mean, my God, people that, I mean, you know how much you have to
[1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:03.960]  read when you go through law school. That was the one law class I took. It was like ridiculous
[1:48:03.960 --> 1:48:09.440]  how much we had to learn. But I learned about defamation. I learned more about it working
[1:48:09.440 --> 1:48:15.200]  for an attorney growing up. And here's what my understanding of defamation was, and I
[1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:21.200]  still believe this is the case, designed this way. It is so hard to win a defamation case.
[1:48:21.200 --> 1:48:26.360]  It is one of the hardest cases that you can possibly win, and that's why you don't really
[1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:33.160]  see or hear much about it. Here's an example. I could, I could go right now and I could
[1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:39.800]  present dozens, maybe even hundreds of cases of articles and videos and all this stuff
[1:48:39.800 --> 1:48:45.280]  of how I've been defamed. Lies about me, hit pieces against me, they're everywhere. Now
[1:48:45.280 --> 1:48:49.400]  I've brought this to lawyers and you know what the challenge is. They say, okay, well
[1:48:49.400 --> 1:48:54.520]  there's no doubt that there's an aspect of defamation here. The problem is, how do you
[1:48:54.520 --> 1:48:59.720]  prove losses in court? How do you prove that because somebody said this or somebody said
[1:48:59.720 --> 1:49:04.040]  that, even if they know they're lying, even if it's clearly false information, how do
[1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:08.520]  you prove financial damages in court? Because that's really what the defamation law comes
[1:49:08.520 --> 1:49:12.480]  down to, right, is okay, well you've been defamed, what did it cost you? We're going
[1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:19.000]  to give you a reward for the damages. So sure, I could, I could go into a court of law, present
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:23.320]  dozens of cases of how I've been defamed, but then how do I equate that to potential
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:26.920]  lost earnings because that's one of the hardest things to prove. Potential lost earnings is
[1:49:26.920 --> 1:49:31.320]  one of the hardest things to prove, so you don't really see that in the court of law
[1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:38.160]  very often. But generally speaking, that's how I understand defamation. What's your understanding
[1:49:38.160 --> 1:49:44.080]  and background of being involved in the legal process for decades of defamation and then
[1:49:44.080 --> 1:49:51.200]  how does it apply modern day and how do you see its application changing over the years?
[1:49:51.200 --> 1:49:54.880]  So I've been doing this work on both sides, plaintiffs and defense side in the defamation
[1:49:54.880 --> 1:49:59.800]  context because of its constitutional implications for freedom of press, freedom of speech, freedom
[1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:04.760]  of expression, freedom of association, for the better part of a quarter century. I represent
[1:50:04.760 --> 1:50:08.440]  the Covington kids. Now let's use that as an example. There the Covington kids were
[1:50:08.440 --> 1:50:12.840]  targeted by a bunch of powerful people, lied about, they tried to destroy their lives,
[1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:16.880]  their careers, their futures, they ended up being subject to death threats and firebombing,
[1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:20.040]  something that was a really direct connection compared to what I think the evidence will
[1:50:20.040 --> 1:50:25.280]  show in this case involving Alex Jones and Sandy Hook. And what happened? Judges said,
[1:50:25.280 --> 1:50:30.640]  nope, you can't sue. They said you can't sue because of this or that or something else.
[1:50:30.640 --> 1:50:34.520]  That gives you an idea. Those kids can't or we're having to go through the appellate process,
[1:50:34.520 --> 1:50:39.480]  going to have to go to the legislative reform process to ever get meaningful remedy. Yet
[1:50:39.480 --> 1:50:45.400]  here in the Sandy Hook cases, they've obliterated all of those rules limiting the constitutional
[1:50:45.400 --> 1:50:52.920]  scope of defamation. So defamation is supposed to be when you make a specifically false statement
[1:50:52.920 --> 1:51:00.640]  of fact about a specifically identified individual that leads, that causes them both emotional
[1:51:00.640 --> 1:51:06.240]  harm and reputational harm in their local community. And that you do so with a certain
[1:51:06.240 --> 1:51:12.760]  state of mind, a certain mens rea, what is usually called malice. In this case, it's
[1:51:12.760 --> 1:51:18.560]  reckless disregard of the truth. That you knew at the time you made the statement basically
[1:51:18.560 --> 1:51:22.680]  that the statement wasn't true or likely to be true about that individual.
[1:51:22.680 --> 1:51:27.800]  Now look at this and there's the constitutional requirement of what's called colloquium. This
[1:51:27.800 --> 1:51:31.740]  goes all the way back to the New York Times versus Sullivan. This is why I don't believe
[1:51:31.740 --> 1:51:37.040]  any of the cases against Alex Jones should have even been court. And a constitutionally
[1:51:37.040 --> 1:51:42.680]  honest court would have thrown out these cases years ago. Why do I say that? Because there
[1:51:42.680 --> 1:51:47.600]  is a requirement under the Constitution, as the court, U.S. Supreme Court said in New
[1:51:47.600 --> 1:51:52.680]  York Times versus Sullivan, that you must make a specifically false statement about
[1:51:52.680 --> 1:51:57.840]  a specified individual. In that particular case, they made a statement about a group.
[1:51:57.840 --> 1:52:02.880]  But generally this is called group libel is not recognized constitutionally or under the
[1:52:02.880 --> 1:52:08.520]  tort law of defamation in individual states. It needs to be about sufficiently about you
[1:52:08.520 --> 1:52:13.120]  that people knew it was about you, not you because you're a group of a hundred or a group
[1:52:13.120 --> 1:52:17.800]  of 50 or a group of 200. It's really about you. It goes all the way back to a case in
[1:52:17.800 --> 1:52:23.400]  New York where one group of people made false statements about a group of salesmen with
[1:52:23.400 --> 1:52:26.840]  which there were only 10 in that department. There are other false statements made about
[1:52:26.840 --> 1:52:31.240]  a group in which there were more than 50. The court said in the group that's more than 50,
[1:52:31.240 --> 1:52:34.720]  they don't know the statements about you. That's too many people. In the group that's
[1:52:34.720 --> 1:52:39.200]  10, okay, they probably do think the statement's about you because that's sufficiently few.
[1:52:39.200 --> 1:52:43.960]  So look at the Sandy Hook cases. In the Sandy Hook cases, and almost all of them, there's
[1:52:43.960 --> 1:52:49.480]  no allegation that Alex Jones said a specifically false fact about a specific individual. Not
[1:52:49.480 --> 1:52:53.840]  there. So what did the court say? The court said we're going to ignore the constitutional
[1:52:53.840 --> 1:52:58.160]  requirement of colloquium. We're going to ignore the tort law of defamation. We're going to
[1:52:58.160 --> 1:53:03.200]  ignore the intentional infliction of emotional distress limitations on torts and say that
[1:53:03.200 --> 1:53:08.680]  now you can sue if you're part of any group that somebody could look you up on the Internet
[1:53:08.680 --> 1:53:13.840]  and see whether maybe you're part of that group, even if that group is 100 or 200 or
[1:53:13.840 --> 1:53:21.320]  300 or 1,000 or more. This is in direct refutation and a direct opposition to every court case
[1:53:21.320 --> 1:53:26.600]  in the history of the country on class libel claims. So they have made special standards
[1:53:26.600 --> 1:53:31.280]  for Alex Jones. Not only is he not allowed due process of law, not only is he not allowed
[1:53:31.280 --> 1:53:35.680]  trial by jury, not only is he not allowed to say he's innocent in a case, not only is
[1:53:35.680 --> 1:53:41.160]  he not allowed to an impartial jury process, he's also not allowed to have the same constitutional
[1:53:41.160 --> 1:53:46.680]  and tort protections that have applied to everybody from time and memorial in terms of governing
[1:53:46.680 --> 1:53:52.040]  libel laws. So that's why it goes to anybody could be put at risk now. So you go out there
[1:53:52.040 --> 1:53:55.960]  and you make a statement about that can be a reference to a broad group of people. So
[1:53:55.960 --> 1:54:00.440]  let's say you go out there and say, you know what? COVID vaccines are not vaccines. They're
[1:54:00.440 --> 1:54:06.440]  not safe. They're not effective. Now somebody who feels injured by that can now under existing
[1:54:06.440 --> 1:54:10.520]  Texas law, the Alex Jones exception of the First Amendment, the Alex Jones exception
[1:54:10.520 --> 1:54:15.000]  of the Constitution, the Alex Jones exception to due process, the Alex Jones exception to
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:21.360]  trial by jury. Now suddenly you can be individually and separately sued for any hurt emotions
[1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:25.680]  they feel and they can pick a politicized venue that is weaponized against you in the
[1:54:25.680 --> 1:54:30.520]  judicial and jury process. And that is why this case is so dangerous and consequential
[1:54:30.520 --> 1:54:35.320]  because constitutionally it puts the First Amendment at risk, constitutionally it puts
[1:54:35.320 --> 1:54:39.600]  due process at risk, constitutionally it puts the right to trial by jury at risk, but also
[1:54:39.600 --> 1:54:44.080]  it's gutting the purpose and principle of defamation on the real purpose is to make government
[1:54:44.080 --> 1:54:50.280]  identified misinformation. In other words, what people in power call misinformation to
[1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:55.600]  allow individuals to weaponize the legal system to allow individuals to sue you into oblivion
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:55:01.200]  and bankruptcy into permanent censorship and suppression of information because you are
[1:55:01.200 --> 1:55:07.080]  a dissident. It is a basically converting defamation law into dissident heresy laws.
[1:55:07.080 --> 1:55:11.600]  That's what the basically Alex Jones is on trial for heresy. That's what it really is.
[1:55:11.600 --> 1:55:17.000]  And that's what they're trying to do to everybody ultimately using Alex Jones as the means to
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:21.960]  do so. And it's not consistent with defamation law, not consistent with the Constitution.
[1:55:21.960 --> 1:55:25.840]  But hey, if it puts money in my pocket and if it hurts my political opposition, then
[1:55:25.840 --> 1:55:30.360]  oh, let's do it anyway. Now, here's what I'm concerned because I've seen concerned about
[1:55:30.360 --> 1:55:34.760]  because here's what the pattern that I've seen is that defamation is just begin going
[1:55:34.760 --> 1:55:39.400]  to become another legal tool for the Democrat Party to destroy its opposition. Basically
[1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:44.120]  only one side of the aisle gets to use it. Here's some other examples. Contempt of court
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:48.600]  or contempt of Congress. Eric Holder, he gets to walk no charges. Steve Bannon, he gets
[1:55:48.600 --> 1:55:54.520]  arrested. How about disruption of Congress? David Hogg, he gets to disrupt, disrupt Congress.
[1:55:54.520 --> 1:55:57.560]  Never arrested, never charged nothing. Oh, and shroyer, though, I'm still in court three
[1:55:57.560 --> 1:56:02.280]  years later for doing it. How about illegal entry to the Capitol? Stephen Colbert staffers,
[1:56:02.280 --> 1:56:06.720]  eh, good for them. Charges dropped. No, no harm, no foul. But if you were a Trump supporter,
[1:56:06.720 --> 1:56:11.480]  American patriot, you're still in jail. You're suffering the full extent of the law. Is defamation
[1:56:11.480 --> 1:56:15.360]  going to become the new legal weapon of the Democrats to destroy their opposition when
[1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:20.240]  it never is applied to them? Absolutely. It's going to be a one side selective means of prosecution
[1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:25.160]  and suppression. What it is, it's recreating the old church, recreating old heresy trials
[1:56:25.160 --> 1:56:30.120]  and being able to lock up dissident thinkers, suppress dissident thinkers, censor dissident
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:34.880]  thinkers using lawfare, weaponized lawfare to do it. As I've told people, Alex Jones
[1:56:34.880 --> 1:56:39.400]  was in business for 25 years, never faced a meaningful lawsuit of any kind. Then Donald
[1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:44.360]  J. E. Trump wins office to the presidency of the United States. People realize how influential
[1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:49.080]  Alex Jones's audience is. So they decided to try to take out the audience by trying
[1:56:49.080 --> 1:56:53.040]  to take out Alex Jones. And that's why I say the front line to Alex Jones that was
[1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:57.800]  supposed to break is you, the audience. It's people who continue to go to infowars store
[1:56:57.800 --> 1:57:02.600]  and make themselves healthier, wealthier and wiser by buying products that are good for
[1:57:02.600 --> 1:57:07.000]  them that keep Alex Jones on the air. And you weren't supposed to do that. You were
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  supposed to fold. You were supposed to capitulate. You were supposed to, when you heard reveres
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:15.560]  cry, supposed to hide under your bed, not get your musket and get out and ready to defend
[1:57:15.560 --> 1:57:20.440]  the country. Because ordinary everyday people have rallied to the cry of Alex Jones and
[1:57:20.440 --> 1:57:24.320]  defend Alex Jones. The only way they're going to censor and suppress Alex Jones is if they
[1:57:24.320 --> 1:57:28.240]  stop his heart from beating. As long as his heart is beating, freedom and Alex Jones will
[1:57:28.240 --> 1:57:33.040]  stay alive. And that's only possible because you, the audience, help make it possible.

[2:00:12.280 --> 2:00:13.720]  The ban and conviction. This is truly like an ordinary case, two misdemeanors in the
[2:00:13.720 --> 2:00:18.520]  District of Columbia at most probation. What do you think of this verdict and what do you
[2:00:18.520 --> 2:00:23.640]  think of what's likely to happen to him? Entirely predictable and entirely in violation
[2:00:23.640 --> 2:00:29.240]  of the Constitution. The only provision of the Constitution which appears basically twice
[2:00:29.240 --> 2:00:36.280]  is trial by jury in and in front of a fair jury. Number one, he's not, he didn't have a fair jury.
[2:00:36.280 --> 2:00:41.640]  Number two, the judge took his defenses away from him, denied him a jury trial. They wouldn't
[2:00:41.640 --> 2:00:47.480]  allow him to put it on evidence, believe that there was an executive privilege involved and he
[2:00:47.480 --> 2:00:52.760]  wanted a judicial determination before he violated the executive privilege. That issue could not
[2:00:52.760 --> 2:00:57.640]  be presented to the jury. So as I predicted on this show and other shows before, the conviction
[2:00:57.640 --> 2:01:03.160]  was a foregone conclusion. The only issue is will it be reversed by appeal either by the
[2:01:03.160 --> 2:01:08.520]  appellate court in the District of Columbia or by the Supreme Court? I think it's very likely that
[2:01:08.520 --> 2:01:14.680]  this conviction will be reversed at some point. I suppose the political overlay is the obvious.
[2:01:14.680 --> 2:01:18.680]  I mean, I always like juries, respect juries. I've tried cases before juries in this community,
[2:01:18.680 --> 2:01:27.240]  but this is a community of 94 percent Democrat. Well, not only that, but probably 97 percent
[2:01:27.240 --> 2:01:32.120]  Trump haters. And all you had to do is ladies and gentlemen, the jury, this man banned and worked
[2:01:32.120 --> 2:01:38.200]  for Trump. That's the end of the case. And then he wants to put on a defense that he was executive
[2:01:38.200 --> 2:01:44.360]  privilege and the judge says, no, the jury is not going to hear that. So even if there were a fair
[2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:50.200]  jury, the judge denied the jury the basic facts. And so the issue in this case has always been
[2:01:50.200 --> 2:01:55.000]  a legal one. When Congress holds somebody in contempt and that person invokes privilege,
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:02:00.360]  do you get to prosecute or do you have to go to a judge first, get a judicial order, and then if
[2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:06.760]  the defendant violates a judicial order, obviously that becomes a crime. That didn't happen here.
[2:02:06.760 --> 2:02:11.080]  That didn't happen in the Navarro case. And the Supreme Court's going to have to resolve that
[2:02:11.080 --> 2:02:17.240]  issue. And I think it was a resolve it in favor of requiring a judicial order before Congress can
[2:02:17.240 --> 2:02:23.560]  hold somebody in contempt. That's a major constitutional issue. Take the United States today.
[2:02:24.360 --> 2:02:33.160]  It is living under a kind of totalitarian culture, which has never existed in my lifetime and is
[2:02:33.160 --> 2:02:43.240]  much worse in many ways than the Soviet Union before Gorbachev. Go back to the 1970s, people in
[2:02:43.240 --> 2:02:53.480]  the Soviet Russia could access BBC, Voice of America, German television if they wanted to
[2:02:53.480 --> 2:03:02.360]  find out the news. If today in the United States you want to find out what Prime Minister Lover
[2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:10.040]  of Russia is saying, can't do it. It's bored. Americans are not permitted to hear what the
[2:03:10.040 --> 2:03:18.760]  Russians are saying. Can't get Russian television. Can't access Russian sources. That means also
[2:03:18.760 --> 2:03:27.240]  that fine American journalists like Chris Hedges, one of the best, is cut out, bored from Americans
[2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:33.240]  because he happens to have a program running on RT, Russian television. You want to find out what
[2:03:34.200 --> 2:03:42.440]  the adversary is saying, which is of utmost importance. You can maybe tune into Indian
[2:03:42.440 --> 2:03:51.000]  state television and find it out. You can read it on LJZ Europe. But the United States has imposed
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:59.320]  constraints on freedom of access to information, which are astonishing, which in fact go beyond
[2:03:59.880 --> 2:04:07.240]  what was the case in post Stalin's Soviet Russia. So there you have it, folks. I mean,
[2:04:07.240 --> 2:04:13.000]  even Alan Dershowitz, even Noam Chosky, Russell Brand, these are classical liberals,
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:17.480]  well known as being on the liberal side of the political spectrum, but they see the danger
[2:04:17.480 --> 2:04:22.920]  of what's happening in the U.S. right now. And let's just call it what it is. It's the Democrat
[2:04:22.920 --> 2:04:30.600]  Party. It's the American Left turning into a Stalinistic, Hitler-esque authoritarian regime,
[2:04:30.600 --> 2:04:36.760]  and that's what's going on. And so anybody in denial of that is only welcoming their own demise.
[2:04:36.760 --> 2:04:41.320]  Anybody in denial of that is only welcoming the own shackles that are going to be put on
[2:04:41.320 --> 2:04:48.040]  their legs and arms and mind. No, it's dangerous where things are going in this country, and our
[2:04:48.040 --> 2:05:15.160]  only hope is that Americans realize it soon enough to stop us from going down this dark path.
[2:05:36.280 --> 2:05:42.280]  The only way you fail is not taking action today and ordering Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula

[2:06:19.160 --> 2:06:25.640]  And I'm sure considering the current news cycle and one of the biggest stories on going
[2:06:25.640 --> 2:06:32.040]  right now, I'm sure our audience number is up today. And I haven't even plugged yet, okay?
[2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:40.200]  So you have to understand, you know, part of our own problem with not having a bunch of money to
[2:06:40.200 --> 2:06:46.520]  run the place is our own fault because we look at the information, we look at where the country
[2:06:46.520 --> 2:06:51.720]  is going, and it's just like, that's top priority all the time. And then you just kind of hit this
[2:06:51.720 --> 2:06:58.760]  point, you're like, oh, yeah, I got to fund the operation so that we can stay on air. And I won't
[2:06:58.760 --> 2:07:03.960]  pontificate too much on this because it's, I mean, it's kind of embarrassing, actually, it's
[2:07:03.960 --> 2:07:10.040]  nauseating. I mean, if you saw the legal bills that we have to pay here, and I'm not even complaining,
[2:07:10.040 --> 2:07:16.200]  I mean, obviously, I like our lawyers, but it's like, I'm at the premiere of Alex's War this
[2:07:16.200 --> 2:07:19.560]  weekend. And you know, a bunch of people are coming up to me. And it's like a bunch of lawyers
[2:07:19.560 --> 2:07:22.200]  coming up to me. And I'm just with other friends and other people, I'm like, oh, yeah, that's a
[2:07:22.200 --> 2:07:26.520]  lawyer, like how many lawyers do you have? Like, well, I'm in like six cases all the time. So
[2:07:27.240 --> 2:07:33.960]  yeah, there's a lot of lawyers involved here. But that's just what we deal with. That I'm not
[2:07:33.960 --> 2:07:40.360]  even sitting here complaining. I'm just telling you what's going on. Well, we're able to fund
[2:07:40.360 --> 2:07:46.600]  ourselves by selling products at infowarstore.com. And let me just explain something too. Yeah,
[2:07:46.600 --> 2:07:53.720]  the supplement industry is a growing industry. And a lot of these top supplement companies
[2:07:53.720 --> 2:08:01.960]  make tons of money, gobs of money. That's because their margins are wide, because they sell you
[2:08:01.960 --> 2:08:09.800]  a very low grade, low quality product at a high price. So they have big margins. And they're able
[2:08:09.800 --> 2:08:14.120]  to get in all the big box stores, they're able to get in all the convenience stores. And you know
[2:08:14.120 --> 2:08:19.160]  what their model is, it's sell supplements for profit. And then all that profit is just profit.
[2:08:20.280 --> 2:08:27.960]  Well, we operate a little differently. We sell the highest quality supplements with the lowest
[2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:35.720]  margins. That's the operational procedure here, item for store.com is find the best quality
[2:08:35.720 --> 2:08:41.720]  supplement and then undercut the market at the price. And so that's what we do. So we have
[2:08:41.720 --> 2:08:50.120]  thin margins. That's okay. Here's the problem. infowarstore.com doesn't exist to make money
[2:08:50.120 --> 2:08:58.440]  in and of itself. infowarstore.com exists to make money to fund info wars. So you see all these
[2:08:58.440 --> 2:09:02.760]  stories like oh, infowarstore.com, they sell the supplements, they're making hundreds of millions
[2:09:02.760 --> 2:09:11.080]  of dollars, all this stuff. No. If we make $50 million selling supplements, $45 million go into
[2:09:11.080 --> 2:09:18.200]  running the company, and then whatever's left goes into paying the crew. So yeah, I get it. Oh,
[2:09:18.200 --> 2:09:24.680]  they say, well, look, supplements, they make so much money. The money made just funds the operation.
[2:09:24.680 --> 2:09:28.920]  They always tend to forget that aspect or they intentionally forget to mention that. Now,
[2:09:28.920 --> 2:09:35.640]  having said that, vitamin mineral fusion has been one of the top selling supplements.
[2:09:36.360 --> 2:09:41.080]  Really, it's not a supplement. It's a drink mix. But it might as well be a supplement.
[2:09:42.280 --> 2:09:49.640]  It's been the top rated, the top selling drink mix that we have. And it sells out a lot. Now,
[2:09:49.640 --> 2:09:54.040]  I've been a big fan of vitamin mineral fusion since we introduced it probably about five years ago
[2:09:54.040 --> 2:10:01.960]  now. I always have it in my pantry. And I learned also a while ago, because folks, we only have a
[2:10:01.960 --> 2:10:08.040]  thousand bottles of this. I mean, that's how hard it is in the Biden supply chain to even get product
[2:10:08.040 --> 2:10:13.080]  to sell. And so I'm not even going to go off on a jag here about the Biden supply chain that we
[2:10:13.080 --> 2:10:17.960]  could tell you all about how bad it is just from our own experience in the market. It's really
[2:10:17.960 --> 2:10:23.560]  bad. But I'll just stop right there. We were only able to secure a thousand bottles of this.
[2:10:25.400 --> 2:10:28.520]  It might sell out in less than a week. This is one of the most popular
[2:10:29.320 --> 2:10:34.200]  products we've ever put out. I always make sure I have it in my pantry. That's what I'm saying is
[2:10:34.200 --> 2:10:40.280]  I usually buy five at a time, just so next time it sells out, I can be stocked up. It's been sold
[2:10:40.280 --> 2:10:44.520]  out for so long, folks. I'm even out of my backup. I'm on my last canister. I'm out of my backup.
[2:10:44.520 --> 2:10:48.440]  So I mean, I know I'm going to be making a bulk purchase. I know there's going to be a lot of
[2:10:48.440 --> 2:10:54.440]  people in the audience making a bulk purchase, but you know what? We're not even going to sell
[2:10:54.440 --> 2:11:02.280]  it at full price. We're selling it at a discount, 25% off. We could actually sell Vitamin Mineral
[2:11:02.280 --> 2:11:06.840]  Fusion probably for more money right now, and it would still sell out. Instead, we're going to go
[2:11:06.840 --> 2:11:13.880]  25% off Vitamin Mineral Fusion at InfowarsStore.com. I start every day with Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[2:11:13.880 --> 2:11:19.960]  I mix it up every morning with a glass of my filtered water with the filters from InfowarsStore.com,
[2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:26.120]  and just right there, you're getting 100% of your daily value of so many different vitamins,
[2:11:26.120 --> 2:11:33.800]  so many different minerals. It's all right there on the label, and that's what we do to fund ourselves.
[2:11:33.800 --> 2:11:39.320]  So Vitamin Mineral Fusion, back in stock, only a thousand canisters. That's what we were able
[2:11:39.320 --> 2:11:44.040]  to get, folks. I'm sorry, I wish we could have 10,000, but we were only able to secure a thousand.
[2:11:44.040 --> 2:11:49.640]  We're still selling it at 25% off. It's at InfowarsStore.com,
[2:11:51.960 --> 2:11:56.520]  and we hope that you will continue to support us and shop at InfowarsStore.com,
[2:11:56.520 --> 2:12:01.320]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, back in stock, plus just all the other great supplements that we have there
[2:12:01.320 --> 2:12:11.000]  as well. Okay, quick programming note. I am going to be hosting the war room today, and so you see
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:15.560]  I've got a lot of news on my desk here. I haven't even covered a single news story yet. I'm going to
[2:12:15.560 --> 2:12:19.960]  be doing most of my news coverage coming up on the war room today at three o'clock. So if you're
[2:12:19.960 --> 2:12:26.600]  looking for the daily news, three o'clock, when I start the war room, we're going to be delving
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:31.640]  into all the news, all the big video clips. I do have Savannah Hernandez coming in studio
[2:12:32.280 --> 2:12:38.040]  in about 20 minutes, and we'll be talking to her about her recent reports. She just goes
[2:12:38.040 --> 2:12:41.560]  everywhere across the country, asks people about gas prices, how they feel, asks people how they
[2:12:41.560 --> 2:12:46.600]  feel about Biden. She goes into the inner cities where it's just, I mean, just overwhelmed with
[2:12:46.600 --> 2:12:50.040]  drug addicts. It's actually really sad, some of the stuff that she captures. She goes out there,
[2:12:50.040 --> 2:12:54.120]  braver than most journalists, by the way. So we'll be discussing that with her coming up,
[2:12:54.120 --> 2:13:01.240]  and then again, I'm going to be doing all the news coverage in the three o'clock hour.
[2:13:03.240 --> 2:13:12.040]  So let me do this in the meantime. You know, here's what, because it all kind of comes back
[2:13:12.040 --> 2:13:20.040]  to the same problem, and that's, there is a group, a very small group of elitists.
[2:13:20.040 --> 2:13:26.120]  The best way to trace it and track it is via the World Economic Forum. Their leaders, what they're
[2:13:26.120 --> 2:13:31.480]  doing, like, for example, oh, they had the uprising in Sri Lanka, the president steps down,
[2:13:31.480 --> 2:13:39.000]  World Economic Forum, injects their operative into that presidency now, and now they've shut
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:43.160]  off the gas, and you have to have a QR code if you want to get gas. That's the World Economic
[2:13:43.160 --> 2:13:48.200]  Forum. So when you hear statements like this from Jacinda Arden, the failed leader of New
[2:13:48.200 --> 2:13:54.360]  Zealand, the failed leader of New Zealand, she's telling you the truth. I mean, she's as corrupt
[2:13:54.360 --> 2:13:59.400]  as the day is long. She's as bad as it gets when it comes to leadership roles, but she is being
[2:13:59.400 --> 2:14:05.000]  honest. They're the voice of truth. You don't listen to anything else. Here's Jacinda Arden
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:09.720]  out of New Zealand telling you how they really feel. You shut up. You have no authority. You
[2:14:09.720 --> 2:14:15.080]  have no rights. You have no free speech. We're the authority. We're in charge. You listen to us,
[2:14:15.080 --> 2:14:18.600]  and you sit down and you shut up. Here she is saying it in clip two.
[2:14:18.600 --> 2:14:24.200]  The most up-to-date information daily. You can trust us as a source of that information.
[2:14:24.920 --> 2:14:29.880]  You can also trust the Director-General of Health and the Ministry of Health. For that
[2:14:29.880 --> 2:14:34.840]  information, do feel free to visit at any time to clarify any rumor you may hear,
[2:14:35.400 --> 2:14:43.960]  covid19.govt.nz. Otherwise, dismiss anything else. We will continue to be your single source
[2:14:43.960 --> 2:14:50.280]  of truth. We will provide information frequently. We will share everything we can, everything you
[2:14:50.280 --> 2:14:55.320]  are, else you see, a grain of salt. And so I really ask people to focus on that.
[2:14:55.320 --> 2:14:58.760]  So this is a very dis-example of that. It appears to be this text which originated in
[2:14:58.760 --> 2:15:03.720]  Malaysia and has become a viral hoax in Australia and in New Zealand. How irresponsible is it
[2:15:03.720 --> 2:15:07.080]  the people that are sharing that news of a lockdown imminent in New Zealand?
[2:15:07.080 --> 2:15:12.280]  Yeah. And look, that's the kind of thing that adds to the anxiety that people feel.
[2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:18.600]  So I continue to share the message. New Zealanders must prepare, but do not panic. Prepare.
[2:15:18.600 --> 2:15:25.640]  And when you see those messages, remember that unless you hear it from us, it is not the truth.
[2:15:25.640 --> 2:15:33.800]  And I really ask people, just visit covid19.govt.nz. It has all of the up-to-date information.
[2:15:33.800 --> 2:15:36.440]  And we will continue to provide everything you need.
[2:15:36.440 --> 2:15:41.800]  Now, if you don't understand how dangerous that is, if you don't understand how dystopian that is,
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:47.480]  I just don't even know if I can help you. But see, this is what the World Economic Forum does,
[2:15:47.480 --> 2:15:51.240]  is they give you female leaders so it has that kind of motherly, feminine
[2:15:52.200 --> 2:15:55.160]  look to it when really it's a blood-drenched tyrant.
[2:15:56.920 --> 2:16:03.880]  The number one selling category in supplements worldwide is fat burners, is weight loss formulas.
[2:16:03.880 --> 2:16:10.040]  And listen, there are hundreds of them out there that work, but most of them do it in a toxic way.
[2:16:10.680 --> 2:16:14.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we went out and did deep research on the safest,
[2:16:14.120 --> 2:16:21.400]  healthiest ways to take your overall body's metabolic system and your metabolism
[2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:27.720]  and turn that clock back by turning up your metabolism. Ladies and gentlemen,
[2:16:27.720 --> 2:16:32.840]  diet force does it in a clean, healthy way. It's amazing. I've almost lost 40 pounds
[2:16:32.840 --> 2:16:37.400]  the last three months just using the samples of it, but now it's come into the Info War Store
[2:16:37.400 --> 2:16:42.120]  and is ready for sale to you and your family exclusively at infowarstore.com.
[2:16:42.840 --> 2:16:50.360]  Diet force from X7 exclusively available at infowarstore.com for 40% off.
[2:16:50.360 --> 2:16:53.800]  I want you to experience diet force for yourself. I can't wait for the reviews,
[2:16:53.800 --> 2:16:54.920]  because it's worked great for me.
[2:16:56.920 --> 2:17:01.080]  The eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans.
[2:17:01.080 --> 2:17:05.000]  They financed their universities. They ran full page stories and
[2:17:05.720 --> 2:17:09.480]  advertisements pushing their propaganda of New York Times, other major newspapers,
[2:17:10.040 --> 2:17:14.280]  that the family, as we know it, is a bad thing and must be ended.
[2:17:14.280 --> 2:17:19.480]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that
[2:17:19.480 --> 2:17:23.880]  cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[2:17:23.880 --> 2:17:27.400]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter,
[2:17:27.400 --> 2:17:31.080]  my four national daughter, my wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well.
[2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:35.720]  I love to make breakfast. And literally, it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your
[2:17:35.720 --> 2:17:40.680]  family and be nurtured to, and then all sit down together and have the communal event.
[2:17:41.400 --> 2:17:47.160]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding is our normal biological actions
[2:17:47.160 --> 2:17:51.960]  and coming together. They really are sick, evil, scientific cult of filth and want to
[2:17:51.960 --> 2:17:57.880]  domesticate us and turn us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue. I don't care if you
[2:17:57.880 --> 2:18:02.440]  work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer,
[2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:07.720]  or a millionaire. Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year.
[2:18:07.720 --> 2:18:12.840]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers. 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[2:18:12.840 --> 2:18:18.520]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[2:18:18.520 --> 2:18:22.520]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and
[2:18:22.520 --> 2:18:27.160]  knowing this. So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there
[2:18:27.160 --> 2:18:33.640]  hurting everybody to be able to do things tax wise. It's legal and lawful that allows you to
[2:18:33.640 --> 2:18:38.040]  keep more of your money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last
[2:18:38.040 --> 2:18:45.320]  few years. The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word,
[2:18:45.320 --> 2:18:53.400]  jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-904-285-833-904-285.
[2:18:57.080 --> 2:19:02.360]  We brought the game changing product previously only available to major oil companies around the
[2:19:02.360 --> 2:19:07.960]  world to the civilian market two years ago, the BioProse, for septic tanks, for porta-potties,
[2:19:07.960 --> 2:19:13.400]  for RVs, for your drains, your boats, it goes on and on. It'll eat the oil off of your driveway if
[2:19:13.400 --> 2:19:20.600]  you just add water. But it's been so successful now we're selling it to major RV parks, pig farms,
[2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:27.640]  you name it because this stuff will eat anything that is organic and it's exclusively available
[2:19:27.640 --> 2:19:35.480]  at thebioprose.com and now infowarstore.com. We sold out of this for almost a year but we made
[2:19:35.480 --> 2:19:41.320]  a major purchase and it is now in stock for whatever your need is at infowarstore.com.
[2:19:41.320 --> 2:19:46.040]  You'll also find instructional videos and more information at infowarstore.com or
[2:19:46.040 --> 2:20:13.880]  feebioprose.com. Made in America, powered by God's great creation, it is amazing and it funds the infowar.
[2:20:13.880 --> 2:20:20.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a phenomenon happening right now and you're seeing it somewhat
[2:20:20.040 --> 2:20:26.120]  represented in Congress with individuals like Marjorie Taylor-Green or now Myra Flores. You
[2:20:26.120 --> 2:20:34.840]  wish you had more examples of men doing this but sadly not so much. We do however have a powerful
[2:20:34.840 --> 2:20:41.560]  statement from Rand Paul that I want to play here in a second but let me just kind of lay out the
[2:20:41.560 --> 2:20:50.840]  build up here. Is justice blind? When Democrats are in charge, she is blind, deaf and dumb.
[2:20:52.120 --> 2:20:57.640]  Now that's the headline from Jim Thompson at Red State but everybody can now see
[2:20:59.400 --> 2:21:06.760]  how Democrats have politicized every department of the U.S. government. The FBI, the DHS,
[2:21:06.760 --> 2:21:13.640]  border patrol, the executive branch, the judicial branch, the court system, I mean everything.
[2:21:13.640 --> 2:21:18.520]  It's never been a better example. Colbert staffers get their charges dropped for illegally entering
[2:21:18.520 --> 2:21:23.320]  the Capitol. Trump supporters still rot in jail for the same thing. David Hall gets to stand up and
[2:21:23.320 --> 2:21:28.920]  disrupt Congress. No charges. Owen Schreuer still in court for something that happened over three
[2:21:28.920 --> 2:21:33.480]  years ago now. So it's never been more obvious. Democrats can break the law, do whatever they
[2:21:33.480 --> 2:21:37.960]  want, hell even riot and burn down cities. It's never been more obvious to the average American
[2:21:37.960 --> 2:21:43.720]  people who the bad guys are. Not even necessarily to say Republicans are the good guys. It's just
[2:21:43.720 --> 2:21:48.120]  obvious the Democrats are the bad guys. Obvious that's the party of evil. And now the two
[2:21:48.920 --> 2:21:55.240]  standards of justice have never been more clear and present either. And so some people are emerging
[2:21:55.240 --> 2:22:02.040]  now. I don't want to say the victims of this but that's just the truth. I mean Steve Bannon is a
[2:22:02.040 --> 2:22:08.200]  victim of the corrupt Democrat party. Steve Bannon is a victim of the two tiered hierarchy
[2:22:08.760 --> 2:22:13.560]  of justice now in this country. And of course there was a powerful interview over the weekend.
[2:22:13.560 --> 2:22:18.520]  Steve Bannon and Alex Jones. Steve Bannon tells Alex Jones he's one of the greatest political
[2:22:18.520 --> 2:22:23.240]  thinkers since founding fathers. One of the greatest since the revolutionary generation
[2:22:23.240 --> 2:22:30.520]  of very powerful interview, Bannon and Jones. And then over the weekend you had Glenn Greenwald
[2:22:30.520 --> 2:22:37.000]  here in Austin, Texas who did an interview with Alex as well at the premiere of Alex's War which
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  let me just say this, Alex not able to be on air today. Not sure when he will be back on air or
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:48.920]  quite frankly if. I'm not trying to be doomsayer here but I'm just telling you what's up. So
[2:22:50.840 --> 2:22:58.360]  Alex's War premiered this weekend. It was Saturday here in Austin, Texas. And I just want to say
[2:22:58.360 --> 2:23:01.800]  something here. I'm speaking for myself and I'll go ahead and speak for Alex. I never do that but
[2:23:01.800 --> 2:23:08.440]  I will right now. We just want to thank everybody that came out and there were so many influential
[2:23:08.440 --> 2:23:14.200]  great people that came out. Thank you guys so much. We had such an incredible time. We met so
[2:23:14.200 --> 2:23:19.640]  many great people shaking hands, taking pictures, everything. It's just, I wish we could have really
[2:23:19.640 --> 2:23:25.240]  like live streamed and televised the whole thing because if you could see the love behind Alex
[2:23:25.240 --> 2:23:31.080]  Jones and the love behind this movement and the friendliness and the smiles and the patriotism,
[2:23:31.080 --> 2:23:35.880]  everything. It's the exact opposite of everything they want to represent us but it really was a
[2:23:35.880 --> 2:23:41.160]  great event. Thank you to Alex Lee Moyer for such a great documentary. Thanks to Play Nice
[2:23:41.160 --> 2:23:44.600]  Productions as well. Thanks to everybody who came out and promoted it and are sharing it.
[2:23:45.960 --> 2:23:51.800]  But here's what it is as Rand Paul says. There's going to come a day of reckoning
[2:23:51.800 --> 2:23:56.520]  where people will rise up. It's going to be peaceful, it's going to be legal, it's going to be lawful
[2:23:56.520 --> 2:24:00.680]  but it's going to save this country and it's going to save the planet. Here's Rand Paul saying just
[2:24:00.680 --> 2:24:06.040]  that on Fox News This Weekend. All right, tonight yet another example, left-wing violence, the same
[2:24:06.040 --> 2:24:12.040]  radical group offering bounties for the locations of any conservative Supreme Court justice that
[2:24:12.040 --> 2:24:17.160]  now attempting to shut down the congressional baseball game according to this group. No,
[2:24:17.160 --> 2:24:24.280]  Republican deserves peace ever again. Senator Rand Paul, no stranger himself to violent agitators,
[2:24:24.280 --> 2:24:30.360]  has been attacked at least twice including one instance right after the RNC convention
[2:24:30.360 --> 2:24:36.280]  when it's the senator and his wife surrounded by far-left lunatics and rioters. I barely got out
[2:24:36.280 --> 2:24:42.040]  of there with his life and of course the incident with the neighbor. Here now is Kentucky Senator
[2:24:42.040 --> 2:24:49.880]  Rand Paul. You know, Senator, I know Washington DC is not far off from New York in terms of their
[2:24:49.880 --> 2:24:56.360]  lack of willingness to prosecute people that are violent, at least in Kentucky. The guy that attacks
[2:24:56.360 --> 2:25:04.360]  you as I understand it paid a price, right? Ultimately, initially a Clinton judge gave him
[2:25:04.360 --> 2:25:09.320]  one month, which is what you might get for shoplifting, came back later and another Democrat
[2:25:09.320 --> 2:25:13.480]  appointed judge, but a more fair-minded Democrat appointed judge gave him another eight months.
[2:25:13.480 --> 2:25:18.440]  So he got nine months, but we still have our major newspapers, both the Louisville Courier
[2:25:18.440 --> 2:25:24.760]  and the Lexington Herald, writing op-eds saying that it was justified, the attack on me was justified
[2:25:24.760 --> 2:25:29.960]  and that I deserved it because I'm somehow a provocative person, that my interviewing and
[2:25:29.960 --> 2:25:34.920]  my style of interviewing Fauci and others is provocative and therefore I deserve violence.
[2:25:34.920 --> 2:25:40.360]  They're still saying that in the newspaper. One of our newspapers employed a young man
[2:25:40.360 --> 2:25:46.600]  who tried to assassinate the mayor, mayoral candidate of Louisville. He got two days in
[2:25:46.600 --> 2:25:52.360]  prison and he was released. The Black Lives Matter bailed him out after two days and he worked
[2:25:52.360 --> 2:25:56.920]  for the Louisville Courier. We now have a new writer for the Louisville Courier who's been
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:26:02.440]  arrested for violent assault and now he's writing that the violence against me was justified,
[2:26:02.440 --> 2:26:09.480]  but he's previously been convicted of assault also. So yeah, the left wing is egging this on
[2:26:09.480 --> 2:26:13.400]  and if we want it to end, we've got to lock people up. The violent people need to be put
[2:26:13.400 --> 2:26:19.240]  away for as long as we can put them away. It seems like, okay, in real time, I was on the radio
[2:26:19.240 --> 2:26:25.480]  on January 6th. I condemned what was happening. I condemned it that night on this show and yet
[2:26:25.480 --> 2:26:31.160]  in the summer of 2020, your Democratic colleagues were either completely silent because it was their
[2:26:31.160 --> 2:26:37.160]  base that was involved in the looting, the rioting, the arson, the attacks on police, thousands of
[2:26:37.160 --> 2:26:44.920]  cops injured, dozens dead, billions in property damage, 574 riots, very few prosecutions in this
[2:26:44.920 --> 2:26:51.560]  case, even though we have a wealth of evidence. We're the Democrats that are lecturing us on the
[2:26:51.560 --> 2:26:58.040]  need for safety and security on the one riot. Why aren't they speaking out against the 574 other
[2:26:58.040 --> 2:27:05.720]  riots? Where's that committee? Think about this. Think about this. A woman in her 60s who's getting
[2:27:05.720 --> 2:27:12.360]  cancer treatment wanders into the Capitol during all this, wanders out, doesn't harm anybody,
[2:27:12.360 --> 2:27:18.920]  is not involved with violence and she gets longer in prison than the people trying to
[2:27:18.920 --> 2:27:24.360]  assassinate a candidate get or it's just amazing what we're doing and who we're letting off of
[2:27:24.360 --> 2:27:29.480]  this. But ultimately there's going to come a day of reckoning where the people who live in New York
[2:27:29.480 --> 2:27:35.160]  City crime disproportionately affects those in poorer neighborhoods and those who are minorities.
[2:27:35.160 --> 2:27:39.800]  One day they're going to rise up and say, we've had enough. The Democrats are not protecting
[2:27:39.800 --> 2:27:45.640]  our children. Kids are dying at the bus stop. Kids are dying on the subway. The Democrats don't
[2:27:45.640 --> 2:27:50.200]  care about your kids and it continues to happen decade after decade. There's going to be a day
[2:27:50.200 --> 2:27:54.520]  that people are going to wake up and say, we've had enough. We're going to vote for a law and order
[2:27:54.520 --> 2:27:59.320]  and Lee Zeldin is the law and order candidate. So I think there is a chance that people will say,
[2:27:59.320 --> 2:28:05.240]  I don't care, black, white, whatever. I'm not associated with any party. I want a stop to the
[2:28:05.240 --> 2:28:11.560]  crime and we have to put people in jail. I think that's coming. I think a big, I think a big push
[2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:16.680]  back is coming on a lot of issues, including we need law, we need order, we need safety and
[2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:23.640]  security to pursue happiness. Parents want reading, writing, math, science and computers in school.
[2:28:23.640 --> 2:28:30.360]  They don't want, let's see, whatever political agenda is being rammed down kids' throats
[2:28:30.360 --> 2:28:36.520]  and they also want lower gas prices and elimination of the inflation record high that we have.
[2:28:36.520 --> 2:28:40.040]  Not hard. Senator, we're glad you're safe. Thank you for being with us.
[2:28:41.400 --> 2:28:44.440]  All right. There you have it. Ladies and gentlemen, when we come back, Savannah Hernandez in

[2:30:11.240 --> 2:30:15.400]  with everything. You might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information.
[2:30:15.960 --> 2:30:19.640]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here. Thank you for that word.
[2:30:19.640 --> 2:30:24.600]  infoworshore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, infoworshore.com is where to get them
[2:30:24.600 --> 2:30:29.640]  folks. And we do have the best supplements. I mean, just like we try our best with our news
[2:30:29.640 --> 2:30:36.200]  coverage and our information, we do the best with our supplements as well. I mean, look at the
[2:30:36.200 --> 2:30:41.640]  hair and beard support formula, folks, this is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away at 75%
[2:30:41.640 --> 2:30:46.520]  off. By the way, it works for me. In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is
[2:30:46.520 --> 2:30:54.440]  working for me. Quite well, I might add. Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support
[2:30:54.440 --> 2:31:00.840]  for men. I go and see him quite often now. We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse
[2:31:00.840 --> 2:31:06.280]  in the strange space between what we've known and what's to come. And right now,
[2:31:06.280 --> 2:31:12.840]  the most important thing to remember is don't panic, stay calm, because now is the time that we
[2:31:12.840 --> 2:31:19.320]  must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe sound course. There is nothing stopping
[2:31:19.320 --> 2:31:26.120]  we the people from making our own rules and building our own society. All we got to do is
[2:31:26.120 --> 2:31:32.920]  survive the crash. And right now we still have time to prepare. The world fiat currency system
[2:31:32.920 --> 2:31:39.960]  is racing towards zero. It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water,
[2:31:39.960 --> 2:31:47.160]  and survival gear to keep us strong and at the ready. Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials,
[2:31:47.160 --> 2:31:57.080]  storable foods, water filtration, first aid, power, and more at preparedtoday.com. So when
[2:31:57.080 --> 2:32:02.360]  I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight. I had brain
[2:32:02.360 --> 2:32:07.480]  fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding on to a job. And I heard Dr. Group on your show
[2:32:07.480 --> 2:32:11.960]  and I listened to it. So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1. And it
[2:32:11.960 --> 2:32:15.560]  worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that too. You had, you know,
[2:32:15.560 --> 2:32:19.320]  with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that. So I took it. And man,
[2:32:19.320 --> 2:32:25.240]  in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened. You
[2:32:25.240 --> 2:32:30.360]  know, I could think again, I could connect with people again. And over the course of the next
[2:32:30.360 --> 2:32:34.760]  couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously took basically all of your supplements.
[2:32:34.760 --> 2:32:39.720]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently is knockout. It literally
[2:32:39.720 --> 2:32:43.720]  like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works. But anyway, so the point is
[2:32:43.720 --> 2:32:48.200]  we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system. And the only way
[2:32:48.200 --> 2:32:53.160]  to do that is to take our own health into our own hands. Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so
[2:32:53.160 --> 2:32:54.520]  much for calling Godspeed.
[2:32:57.640 --> 2:33:03.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:03.640 --> 2:33:18.920]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[2:33:18.920 --> 2:33:22.040]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[2:33:23.320 --> 2:33:30.040]  Joining studio now by Savannah Hernandez, been working for Truth Social, going across the country,
[2:33:30.040 --> 2:33:36.120]  really covering a wide variety of topics. She goes down to the southern border, does incredible
[2:33:36.120 --> 2:33:41.880]  coverage there. She goes out into inner cities. And I mean, she deals with some of the most
[2:33:41.880 --> 2:33:46.280]  deranged crackheads you're ever going to see on film. We'll talk about that. She interviews people
[2:33:46.280 --> 2:33:54.440]  about gas prices, also some strange stuff. As far as a monkeypox rights or monkeypox protest,
[2:33:54.440 --> 2:34:00.360]  this is a whack one. But we'll discuss that. But Savannah, let's start at the border. You've been
[2:34:00.360 --> 2:34:06.440]  covering the border a lot. You've been to Arizona. You've been to Texas. You've been to California,
[2:34:06.440 --> 2:34:10.280]  I think, too, covering the border issue. What are some of the things that you've covered that
[2:34:10.280 --> 2:34:14.280]  you've seen just being boots on the ground down there talking to either Border Patrol people
[2:34:14.280 --> 2:34:19.000]  or the illegal immigrants or just local residents? What are some of the stories that you've covered
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:23.560]  that you don't really see getting national attention? Of course, same thing as always,
[2:34:23.560 --> 2:34:29.720]  National Guard feels that they are very... Sorry, give me one moment here with this.
[2:34:29.720 --> 2:34:34.840]  Okay. So National Guard feels that they're, of course, just very overwhelmed with everything
[2:34:34.840 --> 2:34:39.000]  going on right now at the border. I was actually talking to a couple of the members off the record
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:43.560]  and they were telling me what they're experiencing with the cartel. One National Guard member
[2:34:43.560 --> 2:34:48.760]  found this man who the cartel dipped his head in acid, right? So it's just a clean skull,
[2:34:48.760 --> 2:34:53.160]  flesh on his body still, and the cartel is leaving these types of people, these carcasses,
[2:34:53.160 --> 2:34:57.240]  these dead bodies there for them to find as an intimidation tactic. So that's one thing that
[2:34:57.240 --> 2:35:02.040]  National Guard Border Patrol is dealing with. We also have, of course, the huge influx of migrants,
[2:35:02.040 --> 2:35:07.000]  the people in these local communities of Eagle Pass, Texas, really feeling the implications of
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:12.280]  the open border, feeling like the federal government is working against them with everything going on
[2:35:12.280 --> 2:35:17.480]  here. What we're seeing on screen is some of my coverage from Yuma, Arizona, where you can go and
[2:35:17.480 --> 2:35:23.720]  from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m. you're watching floods of people, hundreds of people just walk over and mess.
[2:35:23.720 --> 2:35:29.000]  There's probably five or six Border Patrol agents there trying to apprehend all of these people.
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:33.400]  What ends up happening is because it's such a large group, sometimes they'll get tired of waiting
[2:35:33.400 --> 2:35:38.120]  and they'll just run into the local farmers' fields, therefore destroying their crop, ruining
[2:35:38.120 --> 2:35:43.400]  their property. So this is what Americans at the border are experiencing every single day.
[2:35:43.400 --> 2:35:48.760]  But it's not even, really, they're not even apprehending them. They go to Border Patrol.
[2:35:48.760 --> 2:35:55.160]  Border Patrol under Biden is now the final piece of the pipeline that is the illegal immigration
[2:35:55.160 --> 2:35:58.440]  process. It's not that they're not apprehending them, they're not sending them back. They run to
[2:35:58.440 --> 2:36:02.120]  Border Patrol because Border Patrol processes them to get them to their final location somewhere in
[2:36:02.120 --> 2:36:06.600]  the U.S. Yeah, exactly. And Border Patrol, too, was telling us how they basically feel like Uber
[2:36:06.600 --> 2:36:11.480]  for illegal immigrants at this point. And they don't get paid. Yeah, they're extremely upset
[2:36:11.480 --> 2:36:14.520]  because they're like, you know what, we're basically just an Uber service. A lot of these migrants
[2:36:14.520 --> 2:36:20.200]  come over. They're extremely entitled with their mentality of like, okay, I just walked a long
[2:36:20.200 --> 2:36:24.040]  journey across the border. I just walked through multiple countries. I was promised money and
[2:36:24.040 --> 2:36:28.520]  housing and give me my money and housing. Yeah, you need to come pick me up, process me and take
[2:36:28.520 --> 2:36:32.280]  me into America. And we have to keep in mind, too, that a lot of these migrants are getting a notice
[2:36:32.280 --> 2:36:36.280]  to appear because people will look at my reporting and say, looks sad. It looks like you're reporting
[2:36:36.280 --> 2:36:40.040]  that Border Patrol is apprehending these people and just letting them go in America. And I'm like,
[2:36:40.040 --> 2:36:43.480]  well, what they're doing is they're giving them a notice to appear. So they're basically saying,
[2:36:43.480 --> 2:36:47.480]  okay, we're going to allow you to stay here in the States. Make sure you come to this court date
[2:36:47.480 --> 2:36:51.480]  so we can work out your immigration status. Of course, many of those people, the majority of
[2:36:51.480 --> 2:36:59.800]  those people not, you know, going to those notice to appear court dates. I forget what the rate was
[2:36:59.800 --> 2:37:03.400]  when I was down there a year ago, we were talking to some insiders that told me the rate is like
[2:37:03.400 --> 2:37:08.600]  15%. I think that show up for their court cases on these deals. Very small percentage. And also,
[2:37:08.600 --> 2:37:13.480]  we saw the new DHS numbers come out about gotaways, right? Because we're seeing the apprehension
[2:37:13.480 --> 2:37:17.560]  numbers. We're reaching historic rates under Joe Biden's administration. But what about the
[2:37:17.560 --> 2:37:21.400]  gotaways, the people who didn't get apprehended? And keep in mind, the reason why these people
[2:37:21.400 --> 2:37:25.480]  don't want to be apprehended is because they're human smugglers, drug traffickers, their members
[2:37:25.480 --> 2:37:31.080]  of the cartel, you know, we just arrested, Border Patrol just arrested not one, but two sex offenders,
[2:37:31.080 --> 2:37:35.320]  one of them a child sex offender, just the other week, because those who are not trying to be
[2:37:35.320 --> 2:37:40.600]  apprehended are the worst of the worst coming over. So in the fiscal year of 2021 to now,
[2:37:41.160 --> 2:37:46.360]  we've had almost a million, it's a little bit over 900,000. In the fiscal year of 2021, it was
[2:37:46.360 --> 2:37:53.160]  a little bit over 380,000. From October of 21 to now, to this point, we've seen, I believe,
[2:37:54.600 --> 2:37:59.240]  like 600,000, it's doubled or tripled since last year. So the numbers are out of control. I mean,
[2:37:59.240 --> 2:38:03.640]  really, we don't even know the numbers. I mean, they tell us we've had two and a half million
[2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:11.400]  illegal entries just this year alone, but who really knows the numbers. And what's amazing here,
[2:38:11.400 --> 2:38:15.080]  so what I was told a year ago, and I don't know if this is still the case, they under Trump, they
[2:38:15.080 --> 2:38:19.640]  used to have some sort of a policy to try to keep track of these people where they would have the
[2:38:19.640 --> 2:38:26.440]  ankle monitors, right? Now, obviously, they don't have two and a half million or three million
[2:38:26.440 --> 2:38:32.200]  or five million or 10 million ankle monitors or however many they would need. So when Biden reopened
[2:38:32.200 --> 2:38:38.760]  the border and the numbers started to influx, they canceled the ankle monitor policy to make
[2:38:38.760 --> 2:38:44.440]  sure people would show up for their court dates. And then they only applied it to if you came into
[2:38:44.440 --> 2:38:49.480]  the country and you were on a tear watch list or a criminal sex offender list or one of these violent
[2:38:49.480 --> 2:38:54.520]  criminal lists, they would still let you in. They'd still say, okay, come in, but we have to put
[2:38:54.520 --> 2:38:59.080]  an ankle monitor on you. By the way, half of them just cut it off. And then they're just gone.
[2:38:59.080 --> 2:39:02.920]  So it doesn't even make a difference. But oh, they'll let you in and they'll give you an ankle
[2:39:02.920 --> 2:39:06.600]  monitor. Most of them still don't show up. They just cut it off. They're in the country. They're
[2:39:06.600 --> 2:39:11.960]  good to go tear watch list, rapists, pedophiles, they all get in. Well, we have to be progressive
[2:39:11.960 --> 2:39:16.200]  and inclusive. You have to remember that, right? So, you know, maybe you're a child, rapist, maybe
[2:39:16.200 --> 2:39:20.120]  you're involved in some human smuggling, some drug trafficking. We need more diversity. Exactly. I
[2:39:20.120 --> 2:39:23.880]  mean, look at what's happening right now in Los Angeles with their district attorneys and not
[2:39:23.880 --> 2:39:30.520]  allowing prosecutors to come to these court dates, right? When these rapists are out on parole,
[2:39:30.520 --> 2:39:35.080]  they're now barring these prosecutors from coming because we have a society now that is pro-crime
[2:39:36.120 --> 2:39:40.120]  and I guess, anti-justice. That's why we're seeing this every single day. And it really is
[2:39:40.120 --> 2:39:44.760]  heartbreaking to go down to the border and watch these people pour over in mass because I will
[2:39:44.760 --> 2:39:49.080]  be very honest with you. Many of them are morbidly obese. They're wearing brand new clothes. Oh,
[2:39:49.080 --> 2:39:54.040]  yeah. New cell phones too. New cell phones. And it's a joke, okay? So, they're coming over and
[2:39:54.040 --> 2:39:57.640]  the reason I've talked to a lot of my friends who cover the border extensively and they say,
[2:39:57.640 --> 2:40:00.840]  well, a lot of them will, you know, put on a brand new outfit because they know the media's
[2:40:00.840 --> 2:40:04.200]  going to be there and they want to look good as they're crossing the border. Some of them
[2:40:04.200 --> 2:40:07.320]  would come in and go straight to parties. I'm not even kidding. They literally come in and they go
[2:40:07.320 --> 2:40:11.560]  straight to parties, folks. They go straight to the bar to celebrate. I mean, I've seen it. And
[2:40:11.560 --> 2:40:16.520]  again, too, I've talked about the rapidly changing demographic in America. You know, I go out and I
[2:40:16.520 --> 2:40:21.000]  do a lot of men on the street reports. That's usually what I do the most. And up in Dallas,
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:24.920]  for the first time, I ran into a language barrier because I'm running into Cubans,
[2:40:24.920 --> 2:40:28.760]  Venezuelans that don't speak English who, of course, have just crossed over to the border.
[2:40:28.760 --> 2:40:34.360]  They've just gotten to whichever city the NGO gave them a bus ticket or plane ticket to. A lot of
[2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:39.240]  them heading to New York, actually. I went into Piedras, Negras, Mexico because I wanted to go
[2:40:39.240 --> 2:40:43.000]  ask these people, hey, exactly which state are you going to and why? And they're telling me how
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:46.600]  many of their friends are already over here, which states they're living in, how many of their family
[2:40:46.600 --> 2:40:50.920]  members are heading over as well, and which state they're going to. Yeah, tell me, I was going to
[2:40:50.920 --> 2:40:55.560]  ask you that next. What states do you hear the most where they're going? New York, surprisingly.
[2:40:55.560 --> 2:40:59.960]  And it's funny because I actually went straight from the border in Texas to New York. And I could
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:04.680]  see in live time the huge demographic change. You're seeing the illegal immigrants all over.
[2:41:04.680 --> 2:41:08.280]  A lot of the times my friends would be like, come on, Stab, you can't tell that person's illegal.
[2:41:08.280 --> 2:41:12.040]  And it's like, no, I can. I can tell they don't speak English. I can tell they just got over here.
[2:41:12.040 --> 2:41:15.320]  You can tell by their brand new clothes. You can tell by the fact that they're flooding
[2:41:15.320 --> 2:41:19.080]  our airports right now. And they all have, of course, the documentation that they received
[2:41:19.080 --> 2:41:22.920]  from these NGOs. So again, you know, I come up here and this is a very repetitive thing. This
[2:41:22.920 --> 2:41:27.880]  is nothing new that I'm talking about. But more importantly, it's like, if this continues to go
[2:41:27.880 --> 2:41:34.440]  on for another two years, where will our country be? I'm already seeing the very open change.
[2:41:34.440 --> 2:41:38.600]  What's it going to look like in two years? I remember I was down at the police station here.
[2:41:38.600 --> 2:41:42.840]  It was probably like two years ago, maybe less. I was down there filing a report or something.
[2:41:42.840 --> 2:41:47.080]  And there was a gentleman outside, middle aged gentleman, who looked like really,
[2:41:47.080 --> 2:41:51.480]  like in trouble. And he was out there and I'm walking in and he kind of like comes up to me
[2:41:51.480 --> 2:41:54.440]  kind of aggressively didn't didn't touch me or anything, but kind of comes up to me like he,
[2:41:54.440 --> 2:41:57.880]  I couldn't really understand what he was saying. He needed help or whatever. He couldn't speak
[2:41:57.880 --> 2:42:02.040]  English. He looked really desperate, really out of his sorts. And I walked into the police station
[2:42:02.040 --> 2:42:06.280]  and I said, before I even was filing the charge, whatever, I said, Hey, you guys know there's a
[2:42:06.280 --> 2:42:09.320]  gentleman outside. He looks like he's in real trouble. Do you know what's going on? And they
[2:42:09.320 --> 2:42:13.480]  just said, Oh, yeah, he's been out here. He's been out there for three days. He's an illegal
[2:42:13.480 --> 2:42:17.320]  immigrant. He keeps asking us for rides, asking us for money. And it's like, they just tell him to
[2:42:17.320 --> 2:42:21.160]  go back out. So they come in and they just they have nothing they don't know what to do. They were
[2:42:21.160 --> 2:42:25.160]  told they're going to have all this free stuff. And they just show up and then they just wander
[2:42:25.160 --> 2:42:28.920]  the streets of the US and expect people to pay their way. Exactly. They're being exploited.
[2:42:28.920 --> 2:42:33.880]  They're being exploited by the cartels. And it's very sad to see what's being allowed to happen
[2:42:33.880 --> 2:42:38.280]  with our open borders policy. So thanks. Great job, Joe Biden. And then they do these photo shoots.
[2:42:38.280 --> 2:42:41.480]  By the way, folks, this is totally look, most of these people don't even know what's going on
[2:42:41.480 --> 2:42:44.920]  politically. They're just coming here for free stuff. They don't know Biden. They don't know
[2:42:44.920 --> 2:42:49.880]  the difference between Biden and a and a biscuit. But Oh, hey, put on the Biden shirts. Look,
[2:42:49.880 --> 2:42:54.600]  they love Biden. Look how great Biden is. No, it's an illegal immigrant invasion to collapse our economy.

[2:44:07.320 --> 2:44:12.200]  health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific islands for its
[2:44:12.200 --> 2:44:18.520]  relaxation and euphoric effects. According to ancient Samoan legend, kava was given as a gift
[2:44:18.520 --> 2:44:24.760]  by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[2:44:24.760 --> 2:44:30.120]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen
[2:44:30.120 --> 2:44:35.560]  up a little. Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[2:44:35.560 --> 2:44:41.800]  The new kava chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava but other
[2:44:41.800 --> 2:44:49.160]  herbs including but not limited to German chamomile, organic skullcap and balearion root. We do expect

[2:47:45.560 --> 2:47:49.480]  Yes, so I've talked to a lot of people in the right wing specifically about my reporting and they'll
[2:47:49.480 --> 2:47:53.560]  say, well, let's bring over the Cubans and the Venezuelans because they're fleeing a
[2:47:53.560 --> 2:47:57.560]  communistic or socialistic state. They understand true oppression. They understand it.
[2:47:57.560 --> 2:48:01.480]  Like we have refugees, we have refugees and we have asylum seekers. Yeah.
[2:48:02.200 --> 2:48:06.760]  Yeah, exactly. So, you know, I talked to my friends about this and I'm like, well,
[2:48:06.760 --> 2:48:10.920]  this is actually a really interesting angle here and I want to go talk to the people coming over
[2:48:10.920 --> 2:48:15.400]  here because, you know, right now we're seeing all of these, oh, Hispanics are fleeing the Democratic
[2:48:15.400 --> 2:48:20.200]  vote and it's because of course Hispanics are very primarily Catholic. They're very family-oriented.
[2:48:20.200 --> 2:48:25.320]  They're very pro-life, very religious. So of course the Democrats stand for everything
[2:48:25.320 --> 2:48:29.400]  that they hate and despise. So I'm talking to these immigrants and I'm like, you know,
[2:48:29.400 --> 2:48:34.120]  what do you think about Joe Biden? And a lot of them view him as this nice man who's giving them
[2:48:34.120 --> 2:48:38.440]  an opportunity for a better life, giving them the opportunity to work, that he opened the
[2:48:38.440 --> 2:48:42.760]  borders for them. And so, you know, I can see the mentality from a lot of people of like, okay,
[2:48:42.760 --> 2:48:46.520]  well, these people are fleeing oppression. They understand what socialism looks like. So they're
[2:48:46.520 --> 2:48:50.120]  not going to vote it back in. But in reality, they're voting for Democrats and they're voting
[2:48:50.120 --> 2:48:54.280]  for Joe Biden because they see the Democratic Party, as we all know, as the nice party that
[2:48:54.280 --> 2:48:59.400]  gave them that opportunity. So they're going to give them, in turn, their vote. The free stuff party
[2:48:59.400 --> 2:49:04.440]  and then, and then the other level of this too is they have all these church groups involved in
[2:49:04.440 --> 2:49:07.640]  this. They have all these Catholic church groups involved in this. So then they come in and they
[2:49:07.640 --> 2:49:11.480]  go through Catholic church groups or these groups and they think, oh, this is good. It's a Christian
[2:49:11.480 --> 2:49:14.920]  Catholic thing I'm getting involved with too. But no, it's all cartel run.
[2:49:15.640 --> 2:49:20.920]  Exactly. And it is so funny too, because again, I went from Eagle Pass to New York. So I'm talking
[2:49:20.920 --> 2:49:25.160]  to these migrants who, you know, were extorted by the cartels, extorted by the Mexican police,
[2:49:25.160 --> 2:49:29.400]  dealt with human trafficking, drug trafficking, saw people get murdered in the Darien Gap.
[2:49:29.400 --> 2:49:32.840]  Like they dealt with all these very horrific things, talking about what's going on in their
[2:49:32.840 --> 2:49:38.040]  country, their tyrannical government. And then I go to New York and I'm looking at what Americans,
[2:49:38.040 --> 2:49:43.800]  okay, are focused in on. And I'm in the middle of a deodorant free monkeypox protest about how
[2:49:43.800 --> 2:49:48.440]  that is the greatest thing that's facing our nation right now is the monkeypox, and I quote,
[2:49:48.440 --> 2:49:53.080]  pandemic. It's ridiculous. And it's just so funny to me to see the disconnect between Americans and
[2:49:53.080 --> 2:49:57.640]  the issues that we're focused in on versus what's actually going on at our border.
[2:49:57.640 --> 2:50:03.320]  Okay. Well, we can transition to this now. I've seen some of this footage. I don't know. I think
[2:50:03.320 --> 2:50:08.440]  you've put a lot of it on Band-Aid video, maybe all of it. But this is some of the craziest footage
[2:50:08.440 --> 2:50:14.760]  I think you've ever gotten. There's really no sense of reality, common sense. I mean,
[2:50:14.760 --> 2:50:18.760]  this is just total twilight zone stuff. These people are out here protesting monkeypox or
[2:50:18.760 --> 2:50:22.680]  they want free monkeypox vaccine. I don't even know how to cover it either. I don't even know.
[2:50:22.680 --> 2:50:27.080]  Protesting monkeypox and they're mad that the government is not providing them
[2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:31.080]  with more vaccines for monkeypox, which again, only affects the gay community.
[2:50:31.080 --> 2:50:34.200]  And so I talked to a lot of my friends about this and they're like, well,
[2:50:34.200 --> 2:50:37.480]  it's a little bit hard to talk about monkeypox because we don't want to just straight out come
[2:50:37.480 --> 2:50:41.800]  out and say it's a degenerate disease that comes from having promiscuous sex and orgies.
[2:50:41.800 --> 2:50:45.320]  And so of course, what I love to do with these types of things is let the gay community speak
[2:50:45.320 --> 2:50:49.400]  for themselves. So that's what I did with this interview. Yeah, I don't know if you want to play
[2:50:49.400 --> 2:50:53.800]  any of this. If you want to pitch to it, but this is some of the wack, this is some of the most wacky
[2:50:53.800 --> 2:51:00.520]  stuff, the most nonsensical. What planet did I wake up on stuff that you've ever seen literally like
[2:51:00.520 --> 2:51:04.360]  at least some of the stuff you can kind of understand and make sense of where it's coming from.
[2:51:05.240 --> 2:51:09.960]  This is like you're on a different planet now. What in the hell is even going on? I don't know
[2:51:09.960 --> 2:51:14.680]  if you want to play some of this footage, but it's like, but it's true. 99% of the monkeypox
[2:51:15.480 --> 2:51:20.600]  patients are having anal intercourse. That's just a fact. It's an STD essentially.
[2:51:20.600 --> 2:51:24.200]  They're in orgies and they're upset at the government because after they contract an
[2:51:24.200 --> 2:51:28.680]  STD from being in a gay orgy, they say that it's because of monkeypox and it's because of the
[2:51:28.680 --> 2:51:33.000]  government's response to monkeypox. Yeah, we can play a little bit of this video because it's,
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:38.440]  again, listen to this own community from their mouth themselves, how they're contracting monkeypox
[2:51:38.440 --> 2:51:44.360]  and how it is spreading. So you were just talking about sex work, monkeypox, for the communities
[2:51:44.360 --> 2:51:50.520]  who maybe don't understand what monkeypox is. Can you explain it to us? Yes, well monkeypox is an
[2:51:50.520 --> 2:51:56.200]  infection. They try not to say monkeypox too much because they live in races, but it has
[2:51:56.200 --> 2:52:01.880]  like terrible effects and it has a lot to do with robbing and it has a lot to do with robbing,
[2:52:01.880 --> 2:52:08.600]  but in parts that's why it affects people while engaging in sex. And for that, it is important
[2:52:08.600 --> 2:52:14.840]  to know that for some people, sex isn't just pleasure, it also works, like in my community of
[2:52:14.840 --> 2:52:20.840]  sex workers. So as a sex worker, how has your community been impacted by these talks? Well,
[2:52:20.840 --> 2:52:27.560]  it has been terribly impacted in the fact that many of us are very scared, right? And because of
[2:52:27.560 --> 2:52:33.160]  that, we are making decisions not to work. So are people in the community having a lot less sex,
[2:52:33.160 --> 2:52:39.640]  would you say, because of the fear of monkeypox? Unfortunately, a lot of people are choosing
[2:52:39.640 --> 2:52:45.640]  not to have sex, but for sex workers, that's not a choice at times, because that depends if you
[2:52:45.640 --> 2:52:52.520]  eat or you don't eat. So that creates a whole mental health issue because you are dealing
[2:52:52.520 --> 2:53:01.080]  with extreme anxiety while working. Imagine if you've been working in a, in a, in a donut place,
[2:53:01.080 --> 2:53:05.800]  right? You have to deal with anxiety or getting something all the time. That's how it is.
[2:53:05.800 --> 2:53:12.360]  So I'm not even gonna try to make sense of that. Instead, let's, let's do a logical comparison here.
[2:53:12.360 --> 2:53:18.200]  That would be like a drug dealer. Let's say that there's been a bunch of, I don't know,
[2:53:18.200 --> 2:53:21.800]  let's say AIDS or something that's been spreading because of needles, right? And this guy sells
[2:53:21.800 --> 2:53:28.200]  heroin and you go up and you say, Hey, you know, there's been a big outbreak of needles
[2:53:28.200 --> 2:53:32.840]  spreading AIDS in New York. And the drug dealer says, Yeah, as a heroin dealer, this is impacting
[2:53:32.840 --> 2:53:37.160]  me. People aren't doing heroin anymore. It's really such a tragedy. Mental health crisis for me,
[2:53:37.160 --> 2:53:42.680]  because I get anxiety now. What if I get AIDS from doing heroin? Like I can't live that way.
[2:53:43.240 --> 2:53:48.760]  And so, I mean, that, but it's, it's just what's so amazing to me is, okay, yeah, you're afraid
[2:53:48.760 --> 2:53:53.240]  you're going to get monkeypox because you know, the activity you're doing is causing monkeypox,
[2:53:53.240 --> 2:53:59.400]  but somehow that society's problem. And that's what I wanted to highlight too with this interview
[2:53:59.400 --> 2:54:05.320]  is that our society is so degenerate and we are so far away from God or any foundation of,
[2:54:05.320 --> 2:54:10.280]  you know, traditional family or decency that these people are out in the streets of New York
[2:54:10.280 --> 2:54:15.640]  on a Sunday at 6pm protesting because they can't be involved in a disgusting orgy. I'm just going
[2:54:15.640 --> 2:54:19.400]  to be very honest with this. They're, they're up there and they're protesting because they can't
[2:54:19.400 --> 2:54:23.480]  be involved in this promiscuous unprotected sex. They think that the government should be responsible
[2:54:23.480 --> 2:54:28.120]  for them and they're dealing with what they say is a mental health crisis. The sign literally says
[2:54:28.120 --> 2:54:32.440]  whores for public safety. I mean whores for public health. Yeah, exactly.
[2:54:32.440 --> 2:54:36.200]  It's absolutely ridiculous. Vaccines for sex workers. What do they want it for free?
[2:54:36.200 --> 2:54:39.560]  Yeah, pretty much. They're blaming the government for their own bad decisions and I'm like, how
[2:54:39.560 --> 2:54:43.160]  about you just don't be a degenerate and you don't have sex? And then it turns into this whole
[2:54:43.160 --> 2:54:49.000]  argument of like, well, I have to have sex. And I took video, some of this person's speech and she
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:55.560]  goes, I wish I was at home screwing somebody right now, but I can't because of monkeypox because I
[2:54:55.560 --> 2:54:59.720]  need the vaccine. Everybody needs this vaccine and the government hates us and they won't give us
[2:54:59.720 --> 2:55:05.320]  this vaccine. And they're literally using the reasoning as to why they need it so they can
[2:55:05.320 --> 2:55:09.560]  have promiscuous sex. It's just, it's so degenerate. Like, I don't know. It's honestly, it's wild
[2:55:09.560 --> 2:55:14.040]  because I remember growing up and I went to a Catholic grade school and then a Christian high
[2:55:14.040 --> 2:55:19.000]  school and they used to do, they would do fear mongering and they would show you images of STDs
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:22.600]  and all this stuff to try to, you know, make sure you don't have promiscuous sex. You could say
[2:55:22.600 --> 2:55:27.800]  it's a bad thing, good thing. I'm not claiming either, but I'm saying, oh, wow, you, there's
[2:55:27.800 --> 2:55:32.840]  general awareness being raised that STDs are spreading and now we know how they're spreading.
[2:55:32.840 --> 2:55:37.400]  And so people don't want to get an STD like, oh no, and that affects me as a whore. Like, oh,
[2:55:37.400 --> 2:55:44.040]  what a tragedy. And, but I guess they want free stuff. They want respect. They want us to be in
[2:55:44.040 --> 2:55:48.200]  rage for them. It's like, no, that's your issue. You're going to have to find it out for yourself.
[2:55:48.200 --> 2:55:52.600]  And again, everybody's focused in on monkeypox when our border is wide open. I went to New
[2:55:52.600 --> 2:55:57.240]  Yorkers as well. And another one of the videos I conducted is what is the craziest thing you've
[2:55:57.240 --> 2:56:03.160]  seen as a New Yorker. And I did this to highlight how degenerate and how much our cities have degraded
[2:56:03.160 --> 2:56:08.360]  to where people are watching, you know, crack addicts rub feces on their face. And they're
[2:56:08.360 --> 2:56:11.960]  like, that's just a normal day in New York. You see it all the time. One time a guy was selling
[2:56:11.960 --> 2:56:15.480]  me crack while he was paying. It was just a funny thing to see. And I'm like, does nobody
[2:56:15.480 --> 2:56:20.360]  understand that this is not normal and this is not how we should be living in America?
[2:56:20.360 --> 2:56:26.120]  And by the way, when they ran these studies in New York, it wasn't just that 90, I think,
[2:56:26.120 --> 2:56:34.920]  I think it was 98 or 99% of the monkeypox were homosexual men having anal sex, almost half
[2:56:34.920 --> 2:56:40.520]  of them had HIV. So they're running around having multiple sex partners at these orgies
[2:56:40.520 --> 2:56:46.280]  being HIV positive. This is too much. It truly is. And it's the best part about New York, too,
[2:56:46.280 --> 2:56:50.840]  is that they're protesting against monkeypox. The dirtiest city I've ever seen in my life.
[2:56:50.840 --> 2:56:55.160]  Trash. It's literally a mountain of trash. Hot trash everywhere. Even the New Yorkers were
[2:56:55.160 --> 2:56:58.520]  laughing and they were like, it's hot trash here. It just, it is what it is. I was going
[2:56:58.520 --> 2:57:03.240]  up to them and I was like, your city stinks. There's trash everywhere. And there's crackheads
[2:57:03.240 --> 2:57:07.400]  shooting up. And you know what's so sad too? It really is a reflection of our society because
[2:57:07.400 --> 2:57:12.760]  people move to New York because they want that. Yeah, they want that degenerate lifestyle.
[2:57:12.760 --> 2:57:17.560]  They want that degenerate society. There's kids that are playing at this park 50 feet away.
[2:57:17.560 --> 2:57:21.640]  Well, people are shooting up and parents are just like, Oh, this is just New York. That's just
[2:57:21.640 --> 2:57:27.000]  America. Now the kids are getting monkeypox and it's confirmed they had contact with gay men.
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:31.800]  I mean, geez, folks. So Savannah Hernandez, thank you so much. You can find her channel on Band

[2:59:57.720 --> 3:00:16.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now your host, Gerald Salente.
[3:00:18.680 --> 3:00:24.760]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show. You know, we just had a big rally over here this past weekend
[3:00:24.760 --> 3:00:29.960]  up in Kingston, four corners of freedom where the seeds of democracy was sown.
[3:00:30.920 --> 3:00:35.000]  Right across the street, you probably can, I could throw a rock and hit it.
[3:00:35.720 --> 3:00:42.200]  This is where they at the county courthouse before it was county courthouse. That's the
[3:00:45.640 --> 3:00:53.960]  constitution. The New York state was written when this was the first capital of New York state
[3:00:53.960 --> 3:00:58.520]  before the British burnt it down. And it's the third Dutch settlement. There are more
[3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:01.800]  pre-revolutionary war stone buildings here than anywhere in America.
[3:01:04.120 --> 3:01:08.760]  Over 70 percent of America's constitution comes from the constitution that was written right there.
[3:01:10.680 --> 3:01:17.960]  The constitution has been destroyed by little freaks, clowns playing presidents,
[3:01:17.960 --> 3:01:27.000]  mayors, senators, congressmen, one freak after another. So we had this big rally here.
[3:01:28.680 --> 3:01:36.600]  We had Judge Andrew Napolitano, Scott Ritter, Gary Knoll, Progressive Radio Network,
[3:01:39.240 --> 3:01:46.920]  Phil Geraldi, former CIA guy, packed people out in the streets of the huge garden,
[3:01:46.920 --> 3:01:49.960]  the crown garden, couldn't fit them all.
[3:01:53.480 --> 3:01:59.720]  We sent out several thousand press releases over the past three weeks,
[3:02:02.280 --> 3:02:05.480]  ran it on Spectrum, ads everywhere,
[3:02:05.480 --> 3:02:19.320]  banned, nothing, zero, zero coverage. The local newspaper up here, The Daily Freeman,
[3:02:19.320 --> 3:02:24.840]  Daily Piece of Nothing, a front page story about some stupid thing,
[3:02:24.840 --> 3:02:38.120]  a little jasmine tears or some stupid thing with people outside, not a peep, not a peep about peace,
[3:02:39.800 --> 3:02:47.720]  nothing. I'm a trend forecaster. I will put my track record up against anybody in the world.
[3:02:47.720 --> 3:02:55.080]  I've been out of it for 42 years. Show me your track record, show me your books, show me your
[3:02:55.080 --> 3:03:01.480]  magazines that you've been writing about, and we can begin the conversation. Otherwise, don't want
[3:03:01.480 --> 3:03:15.080]  to hear it. World War III has begun. Today it was announced Germany is sending some 13 tanks,
[3:03:15.080 --> 3:03:24.120]  howitzers, tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. Last Friday, the United States
[3:03:24.120 --> 3:03:31.320]  announced they were sending more weapons, almost another 300 million. Over 60 billion
[3:03:31.320 --> 3:03:37.480]  dollars has been spent of our money sent to Ukraine. It's not my country. I'm an American.
[3:03:37.480 --> 3:03:49.240]  Prestitudes, look it up in Wikipedia. I'm the guy that created the word.
[3:03:51.480 --> 3:03:58.200]  The media whores that could pay to put out by the corporate pimps in a government whormasters,
[3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:06.920]  like a little Jake Tapper. Hey, Tapper, how come you don't tap about peace? You only bow down
[3:04:06.920 --> 3:04:19.400]  and suck up to war. Hey, the Landis and Cooper, the daddy's girl. Whereas I'm sorry, a mommy's boy.
[3:04:19.400 --> 3:04:27.240]  I forget which one. Gloria Vanderbilt was my mommy. A Vanderbilt. Oh yeah, you think I'd get a job
[3:04:27.240 --> 3:04:35.480]  doing anything other than maybe shining shoes? If I wasn't a member of a club talking about clubs,
[3:04:35.480 --> 3:04:44.040]  look at this. Go fight. Hey, fat mouth. Anybody that wants war, pick up your garbage and go fight.
[3:04:44.680 --> 3:04:54.760]  It's not my war. I'm an American. I honor the founding fathers, no foreign antagonists. We got
[3:04:56.760 --> 3:05:02.760]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the US that supplies the highest
[3:05:02.760 --> 3:05:08.280]  quality signature reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon and other US government agencies.
[3:05:08.280 --> 3:05:14.600]  And now they have produced specifically for us this made America honey and line at a very
[3:05:14.600 --> 3:05:19.960]  affordable price, whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone or big pouches that
[3:05:19.960 --> 3:05:25.640]  protect laptops and iPads or big bags that promote whatever electronics you want to put in

[3:06:13.080 --> 3:06:22.600]  assault on the lives of the new world order. It's Alex Jones. And now your host Gerald Salente.
[3:06:24.920 --> 3:06:31.560]  Yeah, yes, yes, yes, I take my jacket off. Caught me heat wave, tropical heat wave,
[3:06:32.440 --> 3:06:40.680]  temperatures rising. Yeah, when music used to be music, I don't have air conditioning,
[3:06:40.680 --> 3:06:45.800]  a heat air conditioner. They are fans, but they're too loud so I can't kind of shut them off.
[3:06:47.400 --> 3:06:50.440]  Talking about the war, the war started.
[3:06:53.560 --> 3:07:00.200]  Again, I say it over and over again. If I asked you to give me a gun to blow the guy's brains
[3:07:00.200 --> 3:07:06.760]  out across the street, you're an accessory to the crime. America's an accessory to the crime.
[3:07:06.760 --> 3:07:16.760]  We're at war with Russia and not a peep from the prostitutes about peace. You know why?
[3:07:17.880 --> 3:07:20.440]  Because these little media whores love wars.
[3:07:23.160 --> 3:07:34.520]  You know, there's an article in the New York Times today regarding Alex Jones and they use the word
[3:07:34.520 --> 3:07:43.960]  misinformation that is shaping today's misinformation, misinformation, huh?
[3:07:44.920 --> 3:07:50.840]  Well, first of all, I find that sexist. How dare you call it misinformation?
[3:07:51.720 --> 3:08:02.520]  How about Mr. Information? I mean, let's be stupid because the crap that they spewed out in this
[3:08:02.520 --> 3:08:15.480]  article. This is the newspaper, the toilet paper of record. You want to talk about selling misinformation?
[3:08:17.160 --> 3:08:24.440]  How about the Mrs. Misinformation that's spewed out the disgusting lie
[3:08:24.440 --> 3:08:33.880]  that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction?
[3:08:35.320 --> 3:08:42.280]  And they had the proof with the aluminum tubes that they got from Niger and Nigeria,
[3:08:42.280 --> 3:08:46.440]  some crap they made up. How about that misinformation?
[3:08:46.440 --> 3:08:56.680]  How about misinformation that killed over a million people in Iraq, according to some of the data?
[3:08:57.480 --> 3:09:06.360]  And who's that? Colin Powell. Yep, with his little colon of crap because that's what crap goes down,
[3:09:06.360 --> 3:09:16.760]  the colon. At the United Nations, a little colon of crap selling the Iraq war. And here's the toilet
[3:09:16.760 --> 3:09:22.520]  paper record. They call themselves the paper record. There's a toilet paper record because
[3:09:22.520 --> 3:09:31.960]  this is only good to wipe crap up with. Talking about misinformation one after another. Hey,
[3:09:31.960 --> 3:09:38.760]  we're right next to you up here in Kingston. Why didn't you cover our peace rally? I'll tell you
[3:09:38.760 --> 3:09:50.440]  why, Solenti, because we're medial whores that love wars. We're slimy low life pieces of scum.
[3:09:50.440 --> 3:10:07.800]  Quote you, Solenti. Why, how dare you? How dare you? Yep. Never a word from the mainstream
[3:10:07.800 --> 3:10:21.880]  about the words of George Washington and his farewell address. When he warned that any nation
[3:10:21.880 --> 3:10:38.440]  which quote indulges towards another in habitual hatred or in habitual fondness is in some degree
[3:10:38.440 --> 3:10:53.320]  a slave. He told Americans observe good faith and justice toward all nations. Cultivate peace
[3:10:54.760 --> 3:11:06.360]  and harmony with all. Why, you little jerk, Solenti, quoting George Washington
[3:11:06.360 --> 3:11:19.800]  and how dare you? You mean a man that actually fought? Unlike mad dog Big Mouth Mattis,
[3:11:19.800 --> 3:11:28.600]  he wasn't on the firing line as much as I know. Didn't cross the Delaware for peace. No, you were
[3:11:28.600 --> 3:11:37.720]  over there invading a foreign nation that was no threat, did nothing to us in Iraq,
[3:11:37.720 --> 3:11:47.880]  and you destroyed Fallujah. You murderous freak. Oh, what's a Fallujah? Who cares?
[3:11:47.880 --> 3:11:59.000]  What's a hell with Washington? You know why? By their deeds,
[3:12:01.880 --> 3:12:08.360]  the mainstream media does not observe good faith and justice to all.
[3:12:08.360 --> 3:12:20.280]  Instead, their one sided Warhawk narratives are making Americans slaves to the military industrial
[3:12:20.280 --> 3:12:32.280]  complex. Indulges, nations which indulges towards another in habitual hatred or in habitual fondness
[3:12:32.280 --> 3:12:41.880]  is in some degree a slave. And there's Dwight D. Eisenhower, five-star general, supreme commander
[3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:57.960]  of the Allied Forces, two-term president, warning us in his farewell address on January 17, 1961
[3:12:57.960 --> 3:13:06.760]  that the military industrial complex is robbing the nation of the genius of the scientists,
[3:13:08.200 --> 3:13:12.600]  the sweat of the laborers, and the future of the children.
[3:13:15.640 --> 3:13:18.760]  So this is the same military industrial complex
[3:13:18.760 --> 3:13:30.920]  where America's defense secretary Lloyd Austin comes from. You can't make this crap up.
[3:13:33.160 --> 3:13:37.080]  Former guy that sat on the board of directors of Raytheon,
[3:13:38.520 --> 3:13:43.080]  the second largest defense contractor in the world.
[3:13:43.080 --> 3:13:52.840]  Yep. You can't make this up.
[3:13:55.080 --> 3:14:01.000]  Stay safe. Stay safe. Look at that. You can't do a comic book better than this.
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:13.800]  And it's real. Real freaks. Real freaks in control and destruction of our lives.
[3:14:13.800 --> 3:14:25.000]  And you got last month, you had the Senate Armed Service Committee approved an $858 billion
[3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:31.560]  dollar military budget for next year, not $860 million, salente, $858.
[3:14:31.560 --> 3:14:39.160]  I've got to keep that number a little lower. As our country's rotting, going down the crap,
[3:14:39.160 --> 3:14:48.120]  a $16 billion sent to this comedian, $60 billion of our hard-earned money to a guy that played a
[3:14:48.120 --> 3:14:54.360]  comedian in a sitcom and his role was the president of Ukraine and then becomes the president of Ukraine.
[3:14:55.800 --> 3:15:02.520]  Lloyd Austin from Raytheon, now our department of defense said,
[3:15:04.840 --> 3:15:13.160]  not a peep about peace from the prostitutes. I'm heartbroken. We gave everything we could.
[3:15:13.160 --> 3:15:21.000]  This thing cost a lot of money to put on. Totally peaceful. Oh, look at that.
[3:15:22.280 --> 3:15:27.560]  A daddy's girl. She'd be nobody if daddy wasn't mayor of Baltimore, but with a big attitude,
[3:15:27.560 --> 3:15:35.640]  man, or women. Yep. It's one big club and you ain't in it, as George Collins said. Nancy Pelosi.
[3:15:35.640 --> 3:15:39.960]  Oh, now she's going to go to Taiwan, huh? Oh, you're going to fix it over there?
[3:15:39.960 --> 3:15:46.760]  Yeah. Like you fixed Libya with your murderous war? Like you fixed Syria with your murderous
[3:15:46.760 --> 3:15:53.800]  war? Look at these guys. Look at this guy. Yeah, general blob. That's it.
[3:15:55.480 --> 3:16:01.640]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with
[3:16:01.640 --> 3:16:07.320]  facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental
[3:16:07.320 --> 3:16:13.880]  condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarsstore.com. Studies have suggested
[3:16:13.880 --> 3:16:20.200]  that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride
[3:16:20.200 --> 3:16:25.880]  levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory
[3:16:25.880 --> 3:16:33.320]  responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA
[3:16:33.320 --> 3:16:39.320]  fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of
[3:16:39.320 --> 3:16:46.040]  immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about
[3:16:46.040 --> 3:16:52.120]  actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member,
[3:16:52.120 --> 3:16:58.440]  or yourself at infowarsstore.com. The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the
[3:16:58.440 --> 3:17:03.960]  family, to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate our marriages. And the studies are
[3:17:03.960 --> 3:17:11.720]  all clear. The number one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom. And the
[3:17:11.720 --> 3:17:17.560]  number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction. Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes
[3:17:17.560 --> 3:17:21.960]  about this because they don't want people having lasting good love and relationships. They want
[3:17:21.960 --> 3:17:29.560]  to break up society. We are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill

[3:51:21.720 --> 3:51:30.200]  do that area the donbas region they pulled away after the united states over through

[3:52:00.840 --> 3:52:06.600]  are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot
[3:52:06.600 --> 3:52:11.720]  it said joys washington oh you mean
[3:52:15.080 --> 3:52:18.040]  enlightened and independent patriots like myself
[3:52:20.280 --> 3:52:26.600]  who hold launched occupy peace to close down all the bases overseas
[3:52:28.760 --> 3:52:34.840]  bring home the troops secure the homeland nobody coming in anymore we can't take care of our own
[3:52:34.840 --> 3:52:40.360]  we take care of our own then we'll welcome in and put the troops to work to rebuilding
[3:52:40.360 --> 3:52:47.640]  our third world infrastructure the wpa project work progress administration project for the 21st
[3:52:47.640 --> 3:52:53.560]  century is our roads and bridges are collapsing and giving them skills rather than the crap that
[3:52:53.560 --> 3:53:02.120]  they're teaching them in the military oh oh and then if you want to go to war let the people vote
[3:53:02.120 --> 3:53:06.360]  you want to take our money to go to ukraine let the people vote let the people vote

[3:53:15.000 --> 3:53:25.400]  patriot i write a magazine i put the facts out there you ready washington europe has a set
[3:53:25.400 --> 3:53:36.120]  of primary interests in other words they got their own deal which to us have none yet even fighting
[3:53:36.120 --> 3:53:46.600]  back and forth for centuries or a very remote relation oh you mean we're not there with nato
[3:53:46.600 --> 3:53:55.320]  back then they could have done it back then any ancient history there was going on all the time
[3:54:01.480 --> 3:54:09.560]  hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies because they're all fighting for their primary
[3:54:09.560 --> 3:54:23.080]  interests the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns hence therefore it must
[3:54:23.080 --> 3:54:36.600]  be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes
[3:54:36.600 --> 3:54:49.720]  of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collusions of her friendships or enmities
[3:54:51.560 --> 3:54:57.480]  language is a little different back then enemies if it's not our business washington

[3:55:23.560 --> 3:55:42.920]  policy humanity and interest said washington but salinsky says russia will not stop until it gets
[3:55:42.920 --> 3:55:54.760]  smashed and our Lloyd austin said we'll keep giving them weapons to keep smashing them and
[3:55:56.760 --> 3:56:02.840]  the u.s is ready to move heaven and earth to help ukraine win the war against russia
