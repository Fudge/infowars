[00:00.000 --> 00:10.060]  we're live big brother mainstream media government cover-up want answers you
[00:10.060 --> 00:17.560]  want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now
[00:17.560 --> 00:23.720]  live from Austin Texas Alex Jones yes it's Tuesday the 15th of September I
[00:23.720 --> 00:28.080]  will be live for the full transmission but first a key report from John bound
[00:28.080 --> 00:33.200]  according to Reuters Russia has demanded Washington restart military to
[00:33.200 --> 00:38.600]  military cooperation to avert unintended incidents near Syria at a time when US
[00:38.600 --> 00:43.440]  officials say Moscow is building up forces to protect President Bashar
[00:43.440 --> 00:48.520]  al-Assad's government of course Assad is backed by Russia and openly blamed by
[00:48.520 --> 00:52.680]  the United States for attacks on his own people attacks that just don't add up
[00:52.680 --> 00:58.800]  this is a big issue that we're facing here and Americans have seen the lies
[00:58.800 --> 01:03.360]  of WMD's in Iraq they've seen the lies that brought us to Vietnam with the Gulf
[01:03.360 --> 01:07.480]  of Tonkin we've seen so many of these staged events so many of these false
[01:07.480 --> 01:11.160]  flags now I want to be clear as well I believe that there was some type of
[01:11.160 --> 01:14.880]  chemical attack the numbers aren't clear the media has tried to claim already
[01:14.880 --> 01:18.360]  Alex Jones says nothing happened no something happened in the middle of a
[01:18.360 --> 01:26.400]  battle zone in the capital city Damascus of Syria and now Assad's come out and
[01:26.400 --> 01:32.760]  said today why would I attack a bunch of civilians knowing that the West has
[01:32.760 --> 01:36.840]  said that that's their red line a year ago to the day that they would come and
[01:36.840 --> 01:40.840]  bombard us and back up the rebels do I want to get arrested and killed do I
[01:40.840 --> 01:45.440]  want to be thrown out of power do I want to see every church in Syria burned to
[01:45.440 --> 01:48.960]  the ground because the al-Qaeda groups Obama is supporting have said that and
[01:48.960 --> 01:54.200]  I talk to a lot of special forces people on and off air including today and they
[01:54.200 --> 01:59.280]  said yeah none of this makes any sense and the West is on record funding the
[01:59.280 --> 02:04.160]  rebels with even heavy weapons like tanks he's seeking missiles you name it so
[02:04.160 --> 02:12.400]  this is really incredible BBC news admits they put out a fake photo from a
[02:12.400 --> 02:18.280]  real massacre Saddam had been involved in from 2003 but but they they lied and
[02:18.280 --> 02:22.320]  said these were the thousands dead from Assad when it looks like max it was a
[02:22.320 --> 02:26.920]  hundred the Obama administration claims to be fighting ISIS while plenty of
[02:26.920 --> 02:32.480]  evidence shows the Obama administration has long supported ISIS now the hornets
[02:32.480 --> 02:36.880]  nest is stirring in Obama's inner circle the Guardian reports Barack Obama's
[02:36.880 --> 02:41.800]  intelligence chief James Clapper is said to be in frequent and unusual contact
[02:41.800 --> 02:46.120]  with the military intelligence officer at the center of a growing scandal over
[02:46.120 --> 02:50.920]  rosy portrayals of the war against the Islamic State James Clapper the director
[02:50.920 --> 02:55.680]  of national intelligence is said to talk nearly every day with the head of US
[02:55.680 --> 03:01.000]  Central Command's intelligence wing Army Brigadier General Steven Grove which is
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.480]  highly unusual according to a former intelligence official Grove is said to
[03:05.480 --> 03:10.280]  be implicated in a Pentagon inquiry into manipulated war intelligence the
[03:10.280 --> 03:15.280]  daily Beast recently reported more than 50 intelligence analysts working out of
[03:15.280 --> 03:19.200]  the US military Central Command have formally complained that their reports
[03:19.200 --> 03:24.440]  on ISIS and al Qaeda's branch in Syria were being inappropriately altered by
[03:24.440 --> 03:29.120]  senior officials one of the key aspects of the policy-making process in the
[03:29.120 --> 03:33.240]  United States is that analysts get to say what they think without any
[03:33.240 --> 03:38.320]  interference without anybody changing it so this is a very very serious charge I
[03:38.320 --> 03:43.240]  think it needs to be fully investigated and if there is truth that
[03:43.240 --> 03:48.640]  somebody has been meddling with their analysis I think I think somebody needs
[03:48.640 --> 03:53.560]  to lose their job over it appears the giant lie 9-11 victim FBI al Qaeda
[03:53.560 --> 03:59.480]  expert John O'Neill tried to expose is finally caving in on itself now hundreds
[03:59.480 --> 04:04.360]  of Iranian soldiers have been sent to Syria in an effort to help Russia defend
[04:04.360 --> 04:08.840]  the al Assad government according to the Israeli media rendering the Obama
[04:08.840 --> 04:14.440]  administration's sole purpose for truly being in Syria pointless why net news
[04:14.440 --> 04:20.080]  the English language Israeli news website reports that Soleimani commander of
[04:20.080 --> 04:25.400]  Iran's elite Cuds Force is cooperating with Russia an Israeli military source
[04:25.400 --> 04:30.280]  told why net Iran stepped up military involvement in Syria is due to Assad's
[04:30.280 --> 04:34.760]  crisis and under Russian Iranian cooperation as a result of a meeting
[04:34.760 --> 04:39.440]  between Soleimani with Russian president Vladimir Putin this claim has not yet
[04:39.440 --> 04:43.720]  been independently verified it's hard to forecast whether Russia's presence will
[04:43.720 --> 04:47.320]  decide the fate of Syria but it will lengthen the fighting and bloodletting
[04:47.320 --> 04:51.840]  for at least another year because ISIS won't give up the source said John bound
[04:51.840 --> 05:01.560]  for info wars dot com over the weekend the Obama administration dropped its
[05:01.560 --> 05:05.160]  original plans to create a website to rate colleges and instead released all
[05:05.160 --> 05:08.320]  the collected information to the public the rating system received relentless
[05:08.320 --> 05:11.880]  opposition from colleges universities democrats and republicans alike why is
[05:11.880 --> 05:15.600]  that you ask colleges and universities already received more than three times
[05:15.600 --> 05:18.760]  the amount of what students are paying intuition that's about a hundred eighty
[05:18.760 --> 05:22.360]  billion dollars a year coming from grants tax breaks work study funds and
[05:22.360 --> 05:26.280]  student loans and you know how liberals love their free money another interesting
[05:26.280 --> 05:30.080]  fact is that the Department of Education was given access to graduates tax records
[05:30.080 --> 05:33.760]  so they could post how much students are making after graduation this opens up a
[05:33.760 --> 05:37.240]  whole new level of personal and financial information that could be hacked like
[05:37.240 --> 05:40.000]  we saw back in June when the office of personal management was hacked by the
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.840]  Chinese to get the personal data of four million government employees on top of
[05:43.840 --> 05:46.680]  that the information provided by this new study shows that most people are
[05:46.680 --> 05:49.680]  better off getting a job out of high school than going to college rob do

[08:15.840 --> 08:25.440]  lines of the info war there is a lot of things happening in the world but if
[08:25.440 --> 08:28.680]  you turned on national television news here in the US you would think it was
[08:28.680 --> 08:33.280]  Donald Trump visiting Dallas yesterday well our own Joe Biggs was there
[08:33.280 --> 08:37.840]  covering it and we've got some video of that with some of the highlights that
[08:37.840 --> 08:43.000]  will be developing Donald Trump came out and basically hammered sanctuary cities
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.520]  hammered the fact we're giving all this free welfare to illegals and said a lot
[08:47.520 --> 08:52.120]  of things that are quite frankly true and he is now the major front-runner but
[08:52.120 --> 08:58.440]  of course Dr. Carson is a close second so Trump's been attacking him which will
[08:58.440 --> 09:02.520]  only make Carson then go up in the polls similar what the Democrats did
[09:02.520 --> 09:06.920]  attacking Trump early on which is why Rand Paul doesn't want to be friends with
[09:06.920 --> 09:11.280]  the mainstream media he wants them attacking him like he did in Kentucky
[09:11.280 --> 09:16.520]  that's what got him in the Senate and I'm oversimplifying politics here but in
[09:16.520 --> 09:22.920]  this heated environment in this world climate of political systems that we've
[09:22.920 --> 09:28.560]  now entered folks want to hear it brazenly put out they want a populist
[09:28.560 --> 09:36.280]  message that rings with the people we've got a clip of Miss South Carolina
[09:36.280 --> 09:42.880]  blast holes through anti-gun question when they ask her about gun violence the
[09:42.880 --> 09:46.680]  answer is guns aren't committing the violence people are and the answer is
[09:46.680 --> 09:52.360]  getting mentally ill people and folks that have been caught committing crimes
[09:52.360 --> 09:55.800]  the answer is getting guns out of their hands is basically what she said we'll
[09:55.800 --> 10:00.040]  play the clip coming up and it was about education not the gun itself and she
[10:00.040 --> 10:05.720]  got a rousing applause and the media was like oh it's shocking the crowd supported
[10:05.720 --> 10:18.480]  her well that's because the centralized government brainwashing cult system has
[10:18.480 --> 10:25.560]  gone too far because the public has been resisting its propaganda because the
[10:25.560 --> 10:34.200]  public has been saying no to this political agenda they simply increased
[10:34.200 --> 10:38.360]  it two or three times what they were previously doing and I've said over and
[10:38.360 --> 10:45.360]  over again that's wonderful because that's going to backfire if we politically
[10:45.360 --> 10:49.240]  exposed that it's a fraud and don't go along with it another exciting clip I've
[10:49.240 --> 10:56.800]  got here that ties in to Jerry Seinfeld a few months ago coming out and saying
[10:56.800 --> 11:01.120]  political correctness is just terrible many comedians I know will not go to a
[11:01.120 --> 11:10.800]  college now and give a you know comedic speech to the students even if we're
[11:10.800 --> 11:16.600]  asked to go there because we'll be demonized my own daughter when I said
[11:16.600 --> 11:22.840]  hey we're gonna move back to New York this is your 14 years old there's more
[11:22.840 --> 11:30.360]  boys she said dad boys and girls together sexist saying the word boy or girl
[11:30.360 --> 11:35.160]  sexist well no see he thought she was crazy he thought she didn't understand
[11:35.160 --> 11:39.600]  liberalism and political correctness he said she's just ignorant and doesn't know
[11:39.600 --> 11:44.280]  the terms no your daughter's following the directives from the public school and
[11:44.280 --> 11:50.000]  from the private schools and from the TV and from the media men existing is
[11:50.000 --> 11:57.040]  evil women existing is evil he and she existing is bad this is a total system
[11:57.040 --> 12:05.680]  of ending the human community as we know it so we'll get into that clip because
[12:05.680 --> 12:13.280]  now Obama has come out and slammed liberal PC culture on college campuses
[12:13.280 --> 12:20.880]  he said you shouldn't be coddled and that you should read things you don't
[12:20.880 --> 12:23.640]  agree with and even things that are offensive we're gonna play that clip
[12:23.640 --> 12:30.960]  coming up but why would he do that because it's creating such a giant
[12:30.960 --> 12:39.680]  backlash that they want to get rid of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn because
[12:39.680 --> 12:48.440]  it's got words from the period in it and if you can go that far you can ban
[12:48.440 --> 12:56.000]  anything the people directing Obama have him doing this so that people go back
[12:56.000 --> 13:01.160]  to sleep and so that folks think oh see even the president doesn't support that
[13:01.160 --> 13:05.360]  so that you think it's fringe so you think it's insane so you think it's
[13:05.360 --> 13:09.920]  radical you think it's feminizes you think it's environmentalist wackos all
[13:09.920 --> 13:18.760]  those terms that right-wing talk radio taught us they're very dangerous because
[13:18.760 --> 13:26.440]  it's scientific to break up the family it's scientific to restrict words it's
[13:26.440 --> 13:32.560]  a scientific plan to reduce the language so that it's impossible for us to
[13:32.560 --> 13:36.960]  ever intellectualize the predicament we're in this is the dumbing down and
[13:36.960 --> 13:41.160]  the domestication and it's just like having Joe Biden go around and say he's
[13:41.160 --> 13:45.280]  pro-second amendment nobody's coming after your guns it's simply a tactic
[13:45.280 --> 13:51.520]  where Obama shows up to look reasonable right when they know the top is get
[13:51.520 --> 13:55.840]  ready to blow off the top of the stack right when they know that the water is
[13:55.840 --> 14:00.480]  boiling over and he says well here let's play the clip in a moment where he
[14:00.480 --> 14:05.600]  slams liberal PC culture on college campuses and says you shouldn't be
[14:05.600 --> 14:16.680]  coddled from the idea of I've seen it back in high school I walked into a mall
[14:16.680 --> 14:22.400]  bookstore and I bought mine comp by Adolf Hitler because I wanted to read the
[14:22.400 --> 14:27.120]  book written by Adolf Hitler I want to see what he actually had to say and the
[14:27.120 --> 14:31.040]  woman freaked out at the counter and asked me why I was reading something
[14:31.040 --> 14:36.400]  like this I said it's history lady and she wouldn't even have known that it was
[14:36.400 --> 14:41.320]  what mine comp was but Hitler was on the cover of it an orange cover I bought it
[14:41.320 --> 14:45.840]  was the cheapest one they had there they have several everyone's and you can see
[14:45.840 --> 14:56.640]  Hitler on the front of it this is the just incredible ignorance that we face
[14:56.640 --> 15:04.000]  but the social engineers they know it's not ignorance on their part they are
[15:04.000 --> 15:10.320]  instilling mindless ignorance and you see it in play every day the last six
[15:10.320 --> 15:16.480]  years on MSNBC where if you oppose Obamacare they don't intellectually
[15:16.480 --> 15:21.240]  argue with you on death panels or doubling and tripling prices or gruber
[15:21.240 --> 15:26.240]  screwing you over laughing at you they look at you with a straight face and they
[15:26.240 --> 15:35.080]  say why do you hate our black president but here's Obama now playing good cop
[15:35.080 --> 15:40.800]  all his surrogates his operatives the big foundations that created him pushed
[15:40.800 --> 15:47.480]  this agenda he's up there to remind the old classical liberals that everything's
[15:47.480 --> 15:52.160]  okay because here's the secret real classical liberals so I may agree with
[15:52.160 --> 15:57.400]  on some issues but disagree with on others aren't bad people and they're
[15:57.400 --> 16:02.800]  getting really really scared I mean more modern classical liberals a
[16:02.800 --> 16:08.920]  Democrat of say the 40s the 50s or the 60s misguided by major foundations
[16:08.920 --> 16:13.600]  manipulated but not a cultist not someone that wants to burn books not
[16:13.600 --> 16:17.760]  someone that wants to ban free speech they're waking up and getting really
[16:17.760 --> 16:22.520]  really upset right now about the clear tyranny they see from the Democratic
[16:22.520 --> 16:28.520]  Party and that's causing an internal war within their own system I mean a lot of
[16:28.520 --> 16:31.520]  liberals were involved in social engineering because they thought it was
[16:31.520 --> 16:35.520]  for greater good but now they're going wait a minute we're now going to social
[16:35.520 --> 16:39.200]  engineer that father and mother is hurtful and that he and she is hurtful
[16:39.200 --> 16:47.720]  we can't see here she I'm not doing that that is total cult brainwashing and
[16:47.720 --> 16:51.720]  so they back off a little bit but as soon as opposition dies they'll come right
[16:51.720 --> 16:55.520]  back in but it's a big deal to have Obama out giving speeches like this here
[16:55.520 --> 17:05.040]  it is now one thing I do want to point out is it's not just sometimes folks who
[17:05.040 --> 17:12.480]  are mad that colleges are too liberal that have a problem sometimes you know
[17:12.480 --> 17:18.640]  their folks on college campuses who are liberal and maybe even agree with me on
[17:18.640 --> 17:23.280]  a bunch of issues who sometimes aren't listening to the other side and that's
[17:23.280 --> 17:28.480]  a problem too I was just talking to a friend of mine about this you know I've
[17:28.480 --> 17:34.960]  heard some college campuses where they don't want to have a guest speaker who
[17:34.960 --> 17:43.880]  you know is too conservative or they don't want to read a book if it has
[17:43.880 --> 17:49.800]  language that is offensive to African-Americans or somehow sends a
[17:49.800 --> 17:56.680]  demeaning signal towards women and you know I gotta tell you I don't agree with
[17:56.680 --> 18:03.400]  that either you know I don't agree that you when you become students at
[18:03.400 --> 18:08.960]  colleges have to be coddled and protected from different points of view you
[18:08.960 --> 18:18.520]  know I think that you should be able to you know you should invite anybody you
[18:18.520 --> 18:26.040]  know who anybody who comes to speak to you and you disagree with you should
[18:26.040 --> 18:31.240]  have an argument with them but you shouldn't silence them by saying you
[18:31.240 --> 18:36.880]  can't come because you know my sense that I'm too sensitive to hear what you
[18:36.880 --> 18:43.480]  have to say that's not that's not the way we learn either right so what do you
[18:43.480 --> 18:49.840]  think meanwhile I have been censored by Apple I have been censored by Google I
[18:49.840 --> 18:57.000]  have been censored in many other ways for criticizing Obama you read the news
[18:57.000 --> 19:03.720]  articles and when they banned the Obama deception from iTunes even though a
[19:03.720 --> 19:07.360]  major company solicited us and computerized it digitize it to their
[19:07.360 --> 19:12.680]  liking submitted it to Apple they'd never of thousands of films had it
[19:12.680 --> 19:19.680]  refused and the Obama deception was refused by Apple they resubmitted it
[19:19.680 --> 19:24.400]  they refused it again and came back and said it's racist and we don't put
[19:24.400 --> 19:30.920]  racist material on Apple Google solicited us because not all of Google's
[19:30.920 --> 19:36.560]  bad it's compartmentalized groups so we want you to put your your products on a
[19:36.560 --> 19:43.080]  Google store so I did they took it down within one week and they said in the
[19:43.080 --> 19:47.640]  email it is racist now even if it was racist it should have a right to be
[19:47.640 --> 19:54.640]  sold if I pay my percentage that having that platform in a free country but it
[19:54.640 --> 19:58.200]  didn't have anything racist in fact it was about empowering humanity that's
[19:58.200 --> 20:01.760]  what they don't like most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement
[20:01.760 --> 20:05.840]  to boost omega-3s is a good idea but did you know that about 60% of Americans
[20:05.840 --> 20:09.360]  are actually deficient in omega-3s did you know that most fish oil products
[20:09.360 --> 20:14.760]  contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat
[20:14.760 --> 20:18.920]  heck did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are

[24:59.360 --> 25:05.800]  one to ten this is very important I'm about to say the last one it comes to
[25:05.800 --> 25:12.200]  enslavement barbarism human sacrifice
[25:12.200 --> 25:20.240]  historically from the archaeological record and from historians from the
[25:20.240 --> 25:27.520]  time in later Western history but still ancient I'd have to say the West is
[25:27.520 --> 25:36.160]  about an eight for murder enslavement killing evil no problem though every
[25:36.160 --> 25:45.040]  other region every other sector every other human culture is about the same
[25:45.040 --> 25:51.880]  and during different periods of pressure sometimes they're a tan and that's all
[25:51.880 --> 25:57.240]  objective you can put any number on that you wanted to but all I've been taught
[25:57.240 --> 26:05.520]  my whole life was how evil the West was how inherently bad white people were and
[26:05.520 --> 26:15.680]  I studied history from even foreign perspectives and it's just not true and
[26:15.680 --> 26:22.440]  why the West is great and why I say it's the best on average some cultures are
[26:22.440 --> 26:26.160]  veterans other things for whatever manifestation whatever manifests destiny
[26:26.160 --> 26:30.560]  reason just like different breeds of dogs behave differently and have
[26:30.560 --> 26:41.880]  different attributes the West has been the great innovator the great builders
[26:41.880 --> 26:48.560]  the great scientist now much of the ideas the West has come from the East
[26:48.560 --> 26:55.920]  come from the South come from even older cultures but whatever reason many of
[26:55.920 --> 27:03.080]  those cultures fell before and never rose back up and the West the Romans
[27:03.080 --> 27:08.840]  particularly were great innovators at grabbing other cultures and using it
[27:08.840 --> 27:13.720]  when other cultures tended to not innovate they intended to invent
[27:13.720 --> 27:21.520]  things but then not innovate off of that on average and so it was the West that
[27:21.520 --> 27:30.480]  was the melting pot it was the West early on that actually wasn't racist and
[27:30.480 --> 27:37.760]  sectarian like some of the other groups now the West became like that later but
[27:37.760 --> 27:43.800]  to see the social engineers playing us off against each other now it doesn't
[27:43.800 --> 27:49.040]  matter what differences there are what real beefs there are or payback for this
[27:49.040 --> 27:55.000]  or payback for that the stimuli the conditioning the brainwashing the push
[27:55.000 --> 28:01.080]  for political correctness and all of this is about breaking down society and
[28:01.080 --> 28:08.000]  hurting all of us I don't care if you're a white farm boy or a old black man or
[28:08.000 --> 28:13.040]  you are a Mesoamerican immigrant from Guatemala that just came to Austin Texas
[28:13.040 --> 28:21.480]  last week in the final equation the architects of this current world system
[28:21.480 --> 28:30.440]  that's little less than two years old want to destroy your intellect want to
[28:30.440 --> 28:35.880]  destroy your opportunities and are in vicious desperate covert warfare against
[28:35.880 --> 28:42.080]  you in an attempt to suppress the human community coming to a next level
[28:42.080 --> 28:47.560]  event that will then transcend the current crisis we're in and bring us to
[28:47.560 --> 28:53.560]  type one civilization and the moment we hit that next level all of this old
[28:53.560 --> 29:00.800]  dark-aged stuff is out the window and if libertarian ideas take hold and if we
[29:00.800 --> 29:07.400]  truly embrace free will and free association and we praise the greatness
[29:07.400 --> 29:11.920]  in all humans but praise those that are able to use their gifts the greatest
[29:11.920 --> 29:17.600]  extent they will become an example to the young and we will pull out of all this
[29:17.600 --> 29:21.760]  evil and we can do incredible things together but instead we're being
[29:21.760 --> 29:26.680]  sabotaged by the ruling elite who are already in control and who want to pull
[29:26.680 --> 29:32.520]  up the ladder and who don't want your children and my children and their great
[29:32.520 --> 29:37.920]  grandchildren to live together in peace with fabulous technologies that we can't
[29:37.920 --> 29:47.000]  even imagine today my goal at Michael is to empower humanity what's yours
[29:47.320 --> 29:56.720]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[29:58.360 --> 30:02.440]  over the weekend the Obama administration dropped its original plans to
[30:02.440 --> 30:05.680]  create a website to rate colleges and instead released all the collected
[30:05.680 --> 30:08.800]  information to the public the rating system received relentless opposition
[30:08.800 --> 30:12.400]  from colleges universities Democrats and Republicans alike why is that you ask
[30:12.400 --> 30:15.760]  colleges and universities already received more than three times the
[30:15.760 --> 30:18.760]  amount of what students are paying intuition that's about a hundred eighty
[30:18.760 --> 30:22.320]  billion dollars a year coming from grants tax breaks work-study funds and
[30:22.320 --> 30:25.840]  student loans and you know how liberals love their free money another
[30:25.840 --> 30:28.800]  interesting fact is that the Department of Education was given access to
[30:28.800 --> 30:32.440]  graduates tax records so they could post how much students are making after
[30:32.440 --> 30:35.520]  graduation this opens up a whole new level of personal and financial
[30:35.520 --> 30:38.720]  information that could be hacked like we saw back in June when the Office of
[30:38.720 --> 30:41.680]  Personal Management was hacked by the Chinese to get the personal data of
[30:41.680 --> 30:45.120]  four million government employees on top of that the information provided by this
[30:45.120 --> 30:48.080]  new study shows that most people are better off getting a job out of high

[34:40.560 --> 34:46.560]  Now, I've talked a lot about the products. You're going to want to hear this pitch, because this isn't even a pitch.
[34:46.560 --> 34:52.560]  You guys bring me a silver bullet. There was one in here, but it's gone. Thank you. It was probably on the counter. Thanks.
[34:52.560 --> 35:03.560]  I've talked a lot about colloidal silver and how I've had infections before, topically, but also internally, and antibiotics didn't work, and colloidal silver did.
[35:03.560 --> 35:15.560]  And last Memorial Day, last week, I went out to the Lake with family to some friends' houses that had like a 25-foot two-story boat dock, and we were jumping off the top.
[35:15.560 --> 35:26.560]  And one time, I didn't think and didn't blow air out my nose. I don't hold my nose. I just blow air out of my nose in the huge founts of lake water after a big rain, dirty water, somewhat dirty water, shot up my nose.
[35:26.560 --> 35:40.560]  And I remember thinking, oh, my gosh, that burns. I bet I got an infection, because I'm not really infection-prone, but if I swim in a creek or the ocean sometimes or something else, I get earaches like anybody else.
[35:40.560 --> 35:50.560]  And if it goes up my nose, I get my Eustacean tubes blocked and my throat. And then I thought I must have clenched my teeth on Tuesday, because it just hurt on one side of my head.
[35:50.560 --> 35:58.560]  So I ignored it. Didn't even take a little silver for two, three days. Then it spread up underneath into my lymph nodes, started really puffing out.
[35:58.560 --> 36:02.560]  You can't see it too good on TV, but I mean, it's out a good quarter inch on each side.
[36:02.560 --> 36:10.560]  And so I went and saw the medical folks today, really great fellow that I've been going through for years.
[36:10.560 --> 36:19.560]  The truth is, I only used colloidal silver for two days, and I don't know if it worked, because the stuff went down last Thursday, Friday, and then I just quit using it.
[36:19.560 --> 36:28.560]  And then it came back Sunday, and it hurt so bad, then I didn't end up coming to work yesterday. I should have just gone to the doctor yesterday.
[36:28.560 --> 36:34.560]  So I can't get up here like I would normally, because I've had a chest cold before. I couldn't get rid of a colloidal silver, knocked it out.
[36:34.560 --> 36:44.560]  I've had infections before on the skin. But I'll tell you, sometimes colloidal silver doesn't work. It's just one more weapon in a arsenal.
[36:44.560 --> 36:51.560]  That's why antibiotics don't work sometimes. They're an incredible blessing. They've just been overused. So I don't use antibiotics.
[36:51.560 --> 36:58.560]  I really waited. Most folks would have gone in a day or two. I waited another week to go in to try to beat it myself.
[36:58.560 --> 37:03.560]  And I just did it kind of in a half, you know, what way, because I didn't even take a little silver every day.
[37:03.560 --> 37:11.560]  But regardless, I went and got a big shot of antibiotics this morning in my hind end. It did not feel good. And we'll see what it does.
[37:11.560 --> 37:17.560]  But I finally went this morning because I feel like I have ice picks jammed into my jaws on both sides.
[37:17.560 --> 37:25.560]  And I went in, they checked it, 100% blocked on each one of the Eustacean tips. They're all swollen and you name it.
[37:25.560 --> 37:32.560]  I cleared my ears and pus came out. So I'm not bragging, saying I'm tough, any other stuff to be here on air.
[37:32.560 --> 37:36.560]  Please don't call in and thank me and say you're tough. Thanks for being here. Give me grandma's remedy.
[37:36.560 --> 37:42.560]  I'm only telling you why I'm a little slow today, why I pause sometimes when I'm speaking.
[37:42.560 --> 37:50.560]  This is better than laying in bed or sitting on the couch. So I'm glad I'm here on air. I wouldn't miss it.
[37:50.560 --> 37:54.560]  The big problem is you lay down at night. Now that I know it's Eustacean tubes.
[37:54.560 --> 37:58.560]  That's why it's real bad and painful at night as they fill up. So it's a lot worse when I wake up in the morning.
[37:58.560 --> 38:03.560]  I look like a chipmunk or something. But what a miracle antibiotics if they work.
[38:03.560 --> 38:08.560]  You know, I had a chest infection one time I couldn't get rid of, drank two bottles of Floodl silver, knocked it out.
[38:08.560 --> 38:16.560]  Another time, the antibiotics worked great. Just imagine if we didn't have these tools out there.
[38:16.560 --> 38:20.560]  Just like one antibiotic might not work, but another one does. Well, it's the same with Floodl silver.
[38:20.560 --> 38:25.560]  It is not the magic silver bullet, but it's as close as you're going to get to a silver bullet.
[38:25.560 --> 38:33.560]  That's why I call it silver bullet. And again, I could have just doubled down, drunk a whole bottle of it, see what happened.
[38:33.560 --> 38:39.560]  But I think it slowed it down last week because it went away pretty much. Then it came right back this weekend.
[38:39.560 --> 38:46.560]  I just said, that's it. I'm going to the doctor. They gave me some steroids too. I don't know how to take those pills.
[38:46.560 --> 38:55.560]  Anti-inflammatory steroids, not antibiotic steroids for rumor starts there, but I still don't like those. We'll see what happens.
[38:55.560 --> 39:00.560]  When antibiotics do work, they seem to hit in 24 hours. So hopefully I can tell you whether they work or not tomorrow.
[39:00.560 --> 39:07.560]  It's kind of an interesting little lab test we're doing here, but I'm not going to just sit here, take the antibiotics, get better than said it was colloidal silver.
[39:07.560 --> 39:13.560]  If I tell you that colloidal silver has worked for me in many occasions, just because it did. But see, that's the difference.
[39:13.560 --> 39:20.560]  I'm not going to get up here because I know it has some effect and then just say, oh, it's the miracle cure all to everything.
[39:20.560 --> 39:26.560]  I'm just not going to do that. And I know that's not really special either. I mean, that's just somebody telling the truth.
[39:26.560 --> 39:31.560]  But you'd be surprised how many people would give you a load of bull. And that's really what is credits.
[39:31.560 --> 39:36.560]  A lot of alternative treatments is people calling them cures.
[39:36.560 --> 39:41.560]  I was talking to a guy just the other day. We're talking about a friend we have. It's a young woman. She has lung cancer, never smoked.
[39:41.560 --> 39:45.560]  And he was like, well, don't they have a cure for that? Are they have a cure for lung cancer now?
[39:45.560 --> 39:55.560]  And I was talking, it was some mainstream medical thing. I said, oh, it's a cure, sir. I think that's some more promising treatment with a better prognosis of survival rate.
[39:55.560 --> 40:03.560]  So both modern medicine tries to call stuff cures and so does alternative medicine and nutraceuticals.
[40:03.560 --> 40:09.560]  And I think that's really bad. I mean, if something just helps, it's good.
[40:09.560 --> 40:20.560]  If something fixes something right away, I guess you can call it a cure like antibiotics, but it makes the next wave of bugs even stronger.
[40:20.560 --> 40:27.560]  So does it cure it down the road? It's like QE3 or QE4, unlimited money printing.
[40:27.560 --> 40:34.560]  Yeah, it works the first couple of times. Now we're going on QE4, QE unlimited.
[40:34.560 --> 40:42.560]  And they give the money to select central interest who get first use of it. We get all the toxic effects of it.
[40:42.560 --> 41:04.560]  I had four people this morning, four people, a nurse, a waiter, a nurse, a waiter, and two people come up to me, one of the doctor's office,
[41:04.560 --> 41:14.560]  and then a waiter, who wasn't even my waiter at a restaurant this morning after I went early this morning when it opened, and two people, two other people separately.
[41:14.560 --> 41:32.560]  And guess what they all asked me about? They said, all of them, that they listen to the show, they appreciate the show, and use financial collapse imminent.
[41:32.560 --> 41:41.560]  And then in all four cases, they're like, oh, sorry to bug you, you don't look too happy. I got an earache, don't worry about it.
[41:41.560 --> 41:46.560]  I guess my body language was I don't want to be messed with. I hadn't taken any Advil before then, it was really hurt bad.
[41:46.560 --> 41:54.560]  It's like an explosion going on from my left ear. I said, no, no, I want to answer your question.
[41:54.560 --> 42:02.560]  I looked at him and I said, I don't know when it's going to explode and then collapse, but it's like pumping air into a beach ball.
[42:02.560 --> 42:11.560]  You keep doing it long enough, it's going to explode. And the beach ball is got seams starting to split. It's even making noise like air is coming out of it.
[42:11.560 --> 42:18.560]  And the question is, does it slowly expand and pop a bunch of holes and then slowly collapse?
[42:18.560 --> 42:25.560]  But it's still like a big bag on the ground. That's kind of our economy or does it blow wide open and split the seam and it's laying flat on the ground.
[42:25.560 --> 42:31.560]  We're in a total depression. I don't know when it's going to blow. I don't know how it's going to blow exactly.
[42:31.560 --> 42:38.560]  All I know is anyone can tell you this is untenable, unsustainable, mega dangerous.
[42:38.560 --> 42:43.560]  The elites are running the bunkers, delivering armored vehicles every city and preparing a roundup Patriots.
[42:43.560 --> 42:48.560]  Does that sound like a good scenario to you? I don't have all the answers.
[42:48.560 --> 42:56.560]  All I know is this is going on and it's bringing in a world government run by people that are so wicked.
[42:56.560 --> 43:03.560]  They want total world domination over everything you do, every decision you make and over your mind.
[43:03.560 --> 43:11.560]  The globalists do not want you to be perceptive. They do not want you to be powerful. They do not want you to be free.
[43:11.560 --> 43:17.560]  They are incredible enslavers and all I know is they're not good.
[43:17.560 --> 43:26.560]  They claim they're engaging in all this tyranny to bring in a total control system to protect the earth from wars and factions killing each other.
[43:26.560 --> 43:32.560]  I'll be honest with you. If there was a quasi-tyranny, I'm just going to be totally honest from now on,
[43:32.560 --> 43:37.560]  that had good fruits and empowered individuals but went and shut down really bad people,
[43:37.560 --> 43:43.560]  I would say it was a lesser of evils, very dangerous, might become the ultimate tyranny down the road,
[43:43.560 --> 43:50.560]  but I wouldn't fight it to the point of putting my full will against it to where I try to force its hand against me.
[43:50.560 --> 43:58.560]  There isn't a cell in my body that doesn't know the globalists are pure death, our culture, and this society.
[43:58.560 --> 44:07.560]  They are absolutely turned over to destruction of freedom. They are absolutely turned over to dumbing down the population.
[44:07.560 --> 44:14.560]  They are totally committed to every form of oppression you can imagine. There is no worse course than going along with them.
[44:14.560 --> 44:24.560]  Going along with these people, acquiescing, playing along with this modern matrix, is suicide.
[44:24.560 --> 44:31.560]  And it's suicide of the soul and I'm not going to be part of it.
[44:31.560 --> 44:40.560]  So, all I can tell you is I sit back and I study history and I study these people,
[44:40.560 --> 44:45.560]  and it's just unspeakable the stuff they pull off and things they do.
[44:45.560 --> 44:51.560]  And the will to exercise power by these people is incredible.
[44:51.560 --> 44:58.560]  It takes will to put fluoride in water, knowing it's going to dumb people down and cause cancer and infertility.
[44:58.560 --> 45:07.560]  It takes will in every major vaccine line to put hardcore cancer-causing viruses that implant in the sides of the cells,
[45:07.560 --> 45:19.560]  in the cell membranes, and then activate as a time-released weapon to cause a horribly long painful death
[45:19.560 --> 45:23.560]  where they then suck all the money out of the person they're killing.
[45:23.560 --> 45:32.560]  I mean, that is more vampiric than anything I can imagine in some Ram Stoker novel.
[45:32.560 --> 45:40.560]  And if you spiritually look at these people,
[45:40.560 --> 45:48.560]  I hate to be dark, but people don't want to look at the darkness because it scares them.
[45:48.560 --> 45:54.560]  And then the darkness cloaks itself in the light,
[45:54.560 --> 45:58.560]  and so you don't want to look at it because on the surface it looks beautiful,
[45:58.560 --> 46:19.560]  but if you look at the fruits of the New World Order, the fruits of these people, it is abject sorrow.
[46:19.560 --> 46:28.560]  And so I'm just here and my team of great reporters and crew are here to try to just warn people as best we can.
[46:28.560 --> 46:31.560]  We don't have all the answers. We don't know everything.
[46:31.560 --> 46:36.560]  We just know evil when it's staring us right in the face.
[46:36.560 --> 46:46.560]  And they play these childlike games with everybody on the news
[46:46.560 --> 46:49.560]  where they just sit there and go, there's no death panels.
[46:49.560 --> 46:54.560]  You can keep your doctor. It's going to be free.
[46:54.560 --> 46:57.560]  We're not coming for your guns. Nobody wants world government.
[46:57.560 --> 46:59.560]  There's no such thing as a plan for carbon taxes.
[46:59.560 --> 47:02.560]  That's ridiculous, Senator.
[47:02.560 --> 47:07.560]  What do you think we did land on the moon too and there's little aliens?
[47:07.560 --> 47:11.560]  Oh really, Al Gore, here's your company for carbon training.
[47:11.560 --> 47:13.560]  I'm not going to respond to that.
[47:13.560 --> 47:16.560]  It's kind of like that Congressman when he's talking to Jesse Ventura.
[47:16.560 --> 47:22.560]  Jesse Ventura goes, what about this bill for FEMA camps in a semi-nation wide political distance?
[47:22.560 --> 47:26.560]  That guy goes, I don't believe in big machines with great aliens coming out eating people.
[47:26.560 --> 47:28.560]  Ventura goes, no, here's the bill.
[47:28.560 --> 47:35.560]  And the guy goes, oh, that bill, oh, that was another bill.
[47:35.560 --> 47:39.560]  It's all funny to them. They live, we sleep.
[47:39.560 --> 47:44.560]  They're aware of the secrets of the universe to a greater extent. We aren't.
[47:44.560 --> 47:50.560]  But it's our fault that we've let these people in control.
[47:50.560 --> 47:58.560]  I've told you for many years because it was announced by the Council of the Americas run by the Rockefellers in the U.N.
[47:58.560 --> 48:01.560]  It's been putting all the main government literature.
[48:01.560 --> 48:07.560]  I made films about it showing you the literature, showing you their speeches, showing you the four-year documents.
[48:07.560 --> 48:15.560]  15 years ago, eight years ago, these are big data dumps that came out.
[48:15.560 --> 48:20.560]  And they just have responses on television saying, Lou Dobbs and Alex Jones are insane.
[48:20.560 --> 48:24.560]  There is no secret treaty from Waco, Texas 2005.
[48:24.560 --> 48:32.560]  There is no move for a world government and there is no move to make Atlanta or L.A.
[48:32.560 --> 48:41.560]  There's an open commission. It's being set up to establish the North American capital
[48:41.560 --> 48:51.560]  and to declare North America a Latin American state.
[48:51.560 --> 48:58.560]  Now, that's been agreed to by the corporations and countries at least 15 years ago when I first saw it, agreed to,
[48:58.560 --> 49:05.560]  with the head ministers at meetings agreeing to it.
[49:05.560 --> 49:10.560]  Hollywood Reporter today, Infowars.com. It's on DrudgeReport.com as well.
[49:10.560 --> 49:20.560]  L.A. touts itself as Northern capital of Latin America for 2024 Olympic bid.
[49:20.560 --> 49:27.560]  And they officially say it's going to be the capital of all of Latin America.
[49:27.560 --> 49:32.560]  And it's funny and some of those documents is what they say, we don't want Atlanta because it's too eastern.
[49:32.560 --> 49:36.560]  It won't be accepted to then join the full American Union.
[49:36.560 --> 49:39.560]  So we should stick it in L.A. And there it is.
[49:39.560 --> 49:43.560]  And they just roll it out in front of you like they do everything else.
[49:43.560 --> 49:47.560]  And here's my issue. I'm not against the people of Latin America.
[49:47.560 --> 49:55.560]  But the reason they want to merge us with this is because those people never got out from under colonialism for real.
[49:55.560 --> 50:00.560]  They're enslaved. The globalists have got them in a total death grip.
[50:00.560 --> 50:06.560]  And they're only bringing them up here to forge them into a political move that'll break any voting block in North America
[50:06.560 --> 50:17.560]  to stop the public merger into the NAU that was signed by Vicente Fox, Paul Martin, and George W. Bush at Baylor, Texas in 2005.
[50:17.560 --> 50:22.560]  And it came out in the BAMP Canada documents where they admitted it was ratified and signed.
[50:22.560 --> 50:29.560]  So the corporations gave the orders. The heads of government state then voted again to certify and ratify it.
[50:29.560 --> 50:35.560]  The president signed it and then they had a secret legislature certify it.
[50:35.560 --> 50:40.560]  I mean, we're already under it, but they're just getting us ready for the announcement.
[50:40.560 --> 50:43.560]  I mean, this is the games they play, people.
[50:43.560 --> 50:47.560]  So, listen, they are setting up a world government.
[50:47.560 --> 50:53.560]  And it's a world government where they forcibly inoculate you with stuff where you get cancer ten years later and they kill you dead in a ham.
[50:53.560 --> 51:19.560]  The day the Rockefeller's upset that you're not taking the shots, now they're just gonna spray it on us.
[51:23.560 --> 51:27.560]  That's 800-686-2237.
[51:53.560 --> 51:57.560]  That's Silver Lungs dot com.

[53:37.560 --> 53:40.560]  You need 2,000 calories per day under ideal conditions.
[53:40.560 --> 53:44.560]  Most 30-day kits don't have enough calories to sustain you for more than a week.
[53:44.560 --> 53:47.560]  They just don't have enough nutrition to do the job.

[54:23.560 --> 54:32.560]  I know we got loaded phone lines and we'll get to them when we kick the next hour off here in about seven minutes.
[54:36.560 --> 54:40.560]  So, I'm not against all these poor desperate Latin American people that want to kill me here.
[54:40.560 --> 54:43.560]  In fact, on average, I like people from Latin America.
[54:43.560 --> 54:47.560]  In many cases, they are harder working than spoiled third, fourth, fifth generation Americans.
[54:47.560 --> 54:50.560]  So that goes for black kids, white kids, Hispanic kids.
[54:50.560 --> 54:54.560]  Everybody knows they tend to get more spoiled, more rotten each generation.
[54:54.560 --> 54:58.560]  Until you'll see really nice white families with the worst grandkids you can imagine,
[54:58.560 --> 55:03.560]  really nice black families with the worst black grandkids you can imagine, or Hispanic kids.
[55:03.560 --> 55:05.560]  I mean, it really is a phenomenon.
[55:05.560 --> 55:07.560]  So we're so corrupt and decadent.
[55:07.560 --> 55:10.560]  There's an argument that they sell that makes sense.
[55:10.560 --> 55:15.560]  Hey, just let in a bunch of third-world people because, you know, we killed all our babies.
[55:15.560 --> 55:18.560]  We don't have kids and we need somebody to pay Social Security.
[55:18.560 --> 55:20.560]  And these people work pretty hard.
[55:22.560 --> 55:27.560]  The government is advertising now for deadbeats that want welfare and have their babies for free.
[55:27.560 --> 55:33.560]  And the Democrats scoop them up and turn them into hardcore communists, running around with red flags.
[55:33.560 --> 55:36.560]  I mean, I see communists every week now on the side of the road with red flags.
[55:36.560 --> 55:41.560]  I'll just be downtown having dinner and 500 commies marched by, you know, screaming, kill the police.
[55:41.560 --> 55:43.560]  I mean, I got video.
[55:43.560 --> 55:47.560]  And so, the globalists are making their move is the point.
[55:47.560 --> 55:53.560]  So, I understand people wanting to come here.
[55:53.560 --> 55:55.560]  I know a lot of immigrants are great people.
[55:55.560 --> 56:03.560]  I'll say, on average, when it comes to common sense, appreciating things probably have better souls than a fifth-generation spoiled American.
[56:03.560 --> 56:05.560]  Just from what I've experienced.
[56:05.560 --> 56:10.560]  I know they're easier to wake up to the New World Order if I can communicate with them.
[56:10.560 --> 56:12.560]  But the globalists have looked at all the numbers.
[56:12.560 --> 56:16.560]  They've looked at all the angles and they've decided we need giant Eastern European,
[56:16.560 --> 56:23.560]  giant Asian, giant Middle Eastern, and giant Central and South American populations up here.
[56:23.560 --> 56:27.560]  And we're going to politically use these people to break the back of the Republic forever.
[56:27.560 --> 56:29.560]  Take the guns, the whole nine yards.
[56:29.560 --> 56:30.560]  Same thing with Europe.
[56:30.560 --> 56:34.560]  And the Socialist parties and the Communist Party state that.
[56:34.560 --> 56:36.560]  And they admit that.
[56:36.560 --> 56:38.560]  And that's the key.
[56:38.560 --> 56:39.560]  They're arrogant.
[56:39.560 --> 56:41.560]  They think we're so stupid, they've admitted all this.
[56:41.560 --> 56:45.560]  I mean, look at these articles I have right here.
[56:45.560 --> 56:48.560]  Look at these articles.
[56:48.560 --> 56:51.560]  Germany and Austria lose borders.
[56:51.560 --> 56:53.560]  But now they've closed them.
[56:53.560 --> 56:55.560]  I'm going to explain what's behind that.
[56:55.560 --> 56:58.560]  But here's the key.
[56:58.560 --> 57:02.560]  Report, Sweden's pro-refugee policies aren't working out so well.
[57:02.560 --> 57:06.560]  Well, if you want to destroy the country, they're working really well.
[57:06.560 --> 57:09.560]  It's like shooting some eye in the head and saying that bullet didn't work too well.
[57:09.560 --> 57:10.560]  No, it worked really well.
[57:10.560 --> 57:14.560]  Open borders, well first aid, bad news for Europe's most welcoming country.
[57:14.560 --> 57:16.560]  That's their national slogan.
[57:16.560 --> 57:21.560]  The Globe and Mail reports a major new research firm study.
[57:21.560 --> 57:23.560]  Now get these numbers.
[57:23.560 --> 57:31.560]  In Sweden, where equality is revealed, inequity is now entrenched.
[57:31.560 --> 57:38.560]  And it goes on to break it down that 58% of welfare payments go to immigrants,
[57:38.560 --> 57:41.560]  16% to the population that's native.
[57:41.560 --> 57:45.560]  And a lot of them aren't really Swedes.
[57:45.560 --> 57:46.560]  Think about that.
[57:46.560 --> 57:51.560]  Staggering unemployment rate for immigrants, even after 15 years living in the country,
[57:51.560 --> 57:54.560]  and skyrocketing welfare costs.
[57:54.560 --> 57:58.560]  And then it gets into the 1,400% rise in rapes.
[57:58.560 --> 58:02.560]  95% of it is the immigrants.
[58:02.560 --> 58:08.560]  Now these guys from the Middle East don't rape you if you're covered up and have a hood over your head.
[58:08.560 --> 58:09.560]  They'd be scared to death.
[58:09.560 --> 58:13.560]  If you're walking around with your face out, it means you want to be raped, you're a prostitute.
[58:13.560 --> 58:18.560]  And so that mixes with weird Western gangster culture.
[58:18.560 --> 58:20.560]  Because that's what the young kids are like.
[58:20.560 --> 58:21.560]  They're not really even Muslims anymore.
[58:21.560 --> 58:26.560]  It's like thugs that hate the West who think your 12-year-old daughter can be raped
[58:26.560 --> 58:28.560]  because she's wearing a short skirt.
[58:28.560 --> 58:30.560]  I mean, it is crazy.
[58:30.560 --> 58:31.560]  I mean, just, I'm sorry.
[58:31.560 --> 58:36.560]  People from the most third world Middle Eastern countries do not fit in Sweden, folks.
[58:36.560 --> 58:37.560]  They just don't.
[58:37.560 --> 58:39.560]  And the engineers know that.
[58:39.560 --> 58:41.560]  I mean, it just doesn't fit.
[58:41.560 --> 59:10.560]  It's like putting Martians in your living room.
[59:11.560 --> 59:12.560]  That's it for this video.
[59:12.560 --> 59:41.560]  Thank you for watching.
[59:42.560 --> 1:00:08.560]  We'll see you next time.
[1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:37.560]  We'll see you next time.

[3:30:07.560 --> 3:30:34.560]  Thank you.
[3:30:34.560 --> 3:30:58.560]  Thank you.

[3:39:49.560 --> 3:40:16.560]  Thank you.
[3:40:16.560 --> 3:40:43.560]  Thank you.
[3:40:43.560 --> 3:41:10.560]  Thank you.
[3:41:10.560 --> 3:41:37.560]  Thank you.
[3:41:37.560 --> 3:42:04.560]  Thank you.
[3:42:04.560 --> 3:42:31.560]  Thank you.
[3:42:31.560 --> 3:42:59.560]  Thank you.
[3:42:59.560 --> 3:43:26.560]  Thank you.
[3:43:26.560 --> 3:43:53.560]  Thank you.
[3:43:53.560 --> 3:44:20.560]  Thank you.
[3:44:20.560 --> 3:44:47.560]  Thank you.
[3:44:47.560 --> 3:45:14.560]  Thank you.
[3:45:14.560 --> 3:45:42.560]  Thank you.
[3:45:42.560 --> 3:46:11.560]  Thank you.
[3:46:12.560 --> 3:46:39.560]  Thank you.
[3:46:39.560 --> 3:47:06.560]  Thank you.
[3:47:06.560 --> 3:47:35.560]  Thank you.
[3:47:36.560 --> 3:48:03.560]  Thank you.
[3:48:03.560 --> 3:48:31.560]  Thank you.
[3:48:31.560 --> 3:48:58.560]  Thank you.
[3:48:58.560 --> 3:49:25.560]  Thank you.
[3:49:25.560 --> 3:49:52.560]  Thank you.
[3:49:52.560 --> 3:50:20.560]  Thank you.
[3:50:20.560 --> 3:50:49.560]  Thank you.
[3:50:50.560 --> 3:51:17.560]  Thank you.
[3:51:17.560 --> 3:51:44.560]  Thank you.
[3:51:44.560 --> 3:52:11.560]  Thank you.
[3:52:11.560 --> 3:52:38.560]  Thank you.
[3:52:38.560 --> 3:53:05.560]  Thank you.
[3:53:05.560 --> 3:53:34.560]  Thank you.
[3:53:35.560 --> 3:53:58.560]  Thank you.
[3:54:05.560 --> 3:54:09.560]  Welcome back to the news wrap up for Info Wars.
[3:54:09.560 --> 3:54:11.560]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[3:54:11.560 --> 3:54:12.560]  I'm David Knight.
[3:54:12.560 --> 3:54:14.560]  I apologize to the callers that were on hold.
[3:54:14.560 --> 3:54:21.560]  We just don't have time to take any more calls because I wanted to get to what's happening with the calls for a European army.
[3:54:21.560 --> 3:54:23.560]  That's right, calls for a European army.
[3:54:23.560 --> 3:54:25.560]  We really haven't talked about this much.
[3:54:25.560 --> 3:54:32.560]  Before we do real quickly, I just want to let you know this hour, the Alex Jones show is brought to you by the products that we sell at Info Wars Life Select.
[3:54:32.560 --> 3:54:35.560]  One of those that is now back in stock is Brainforce.
[3:54:35.560 --> 3:54:38.560]  This is something that I use regularly.
[3:54:38.560 --> 3:54:42.560]  It is different from caffeine or energy drinks or other supplements.
[3:54:42.560 --> 3:54:50.560]  It uses natural activation, helps me to feel more focused, and it uses ingredients that we are proud to put on the label.
[3:54:50.560 --> 3:55:00.560]  That's the whole point of this labeling issue that I was talking about, the back and forth with the support for stopping GMO labeling that Rand Paul said he supports.
[3:55:00.560 --> 3:55:05.560]  We need to be proud of the ingredients that we're putting in our products if we're honest.
[3:55:05.560 --> 3:55:08.560]  We try to put the best ingredients that we can in our products.
[3:55:08.560 --> 3:55:09.560]  We tell you what's in it.
[3:55:09.560 --> 3:55:12.560]  In this particular one, we have things like Yerba mate extract.
[3:55:12.560 --> 3:55:17.560]  We have alpha, GPC, look those up, understand what those ingredients do for you.
[3:55:17.560 --> 3:55:18.560]  Do your research.
[3:55:18.560 --> 3:55:19.560]  Research the stuff that we put in there.
[3:55:19.560 --> 3:55:20.560]  We're proud of it.
[3:55:20.560 --> 3:55:21.560]  We stand behind it.
[3:55:21.560 --> 3:55:23.560]  We defend what we put in there.
[3:55:23.560 --> 3:55:28.560]  If we find that there's something that changes in terms of the research understanding, we will change the formulation.
[3:55:28.560 --> 3:55:30.560]  But we are proud of what we have in our products.
[3:55:30.560 --> 3:55:37.560]  And again, Brainforce is now available at infowarslife.com after selling out immediately when we put it out there.
[3:55:37.560 --> 3:55:44.560]  Now, I want to get to what's going on in Europe because we've all been talking about the massive uncontrolled immigration that is coming in through Europe.
[3:55:44.560 --> 3:55:47.560]  And of course, Angela Merkel has said, bring them all to Germany.
[3:55:47.560 --> 3:55:50.560]  But then they had to stop that a couple of days ago.
[3:55:50.560 --> 3:55:52.560]  They were being absolutely overwhelmed by it.
[3:55:52.560 --> 3:55:57.560]  Other countries have closed their border because there is a limit to how much you can do.
[3:55:57.560 --> 3:56:06.560]  And it's a good example, I think, of not being able to deal with the symptoms of a problem if you don't deal with the fundamentals that cause that problem.
[3:56:06.560 --> 3:56:07.560]  We talk about that with health all the time.
[3:56:07.560 --> 3:56:13.560]  We say, why continue to treat the symptoms of disease when you can try to do something to stop the source of it?
[3:56:13.560 --> 3:56:22.560]  Well, the source of this disease that is going on with uncontrolled immigration in Europe is the conflict in Syria that we have manufactured.
[3:56:22.560 --> 3:56:31.560]  The people and ISIS that we have trained, equipped and created, the people that John McCain and Obama have met with and trained,
[3:56:31.560 --> 3:56:33.560]  that's the source of the disease.
[3:56:33.560 --> 3:56:38.560]  Deal with that before you try to deal with the festering problems that come out of this.
[3:56:38.560 --> 3:56:40.560]  But now, understand where this is all headed.
[3:56:40.560 --> 3:56:48.560]  Understand that is a crisis to drive us to the solution that they have been engineering for decades.
[3:56:48.560 --> 3:56:53.560]  So it's the end of World War II. We're now looking at perhaps a fourth rike in the making.
[3:56:53.560 --> 3:57:01.560]  Understand that with Germany throwing their weight around with Greece, with other countries in the EU, it's not just the financial issues.
[3:57:01.560 --> 3:57:03.560]  They now want an army.
[3:57:03.560 --> 3:57:07.560]  And of course, this is something that has been cooking for the last six months or so.
[3:57:07.560 --> 3:57:10.560]  There were articles going back into March.
[3:57:10.560 --> 3:57:11.560]  Listen to this one.
[3:57:11.560 --> 3:57:13.560]  This is Wall Street Journal reporting on this.
[3:57:13.560 --> 3:57:19.560]  Back in March, this is the German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen saying,
[3:57:19.560 --> 3:57:28.560]  I am convinced that a European army or a European Defense Union can be created as a logical consequence of European integration.
[3:57:28.560 --> 3:57:39.560]  Okay, she says Europe will only stay politically relevant in the future if we're able to complement our economic power and our political influence with a truly coherent security defense policy.
[3:57:39.560 --> 3:57:44.560]  Now, as we saw these manufactured economic crises, people were saying, people like Alan Greenspan,
[3:57:44.560 --> 3:57:47.560]  people like the head of the largest bond company in the world, PIMCO.
[3:57:47.560 --> 3:57:52.560]  We're all saying you're not going to solve the economic situation unless you have political union.
[3:57:52.560 --> 3:57:56.560]  Well, ask yourself, who is going to fund the army?
[3:57:56.560 --> 3:57:59.560]  It's going to be funded with European taxes.
[3:57:59.560 --> 3:58:01.560]  Who's going to control this army?
[3:58:01.560 --> 3:58:03.560]  Most likely, Germany.
[3:58:03.560 --> 3:58:07.560]  This is something that is going to create a United States of Europe.
[3:58:07.560 --> 3:58:09.560]  This is what they've been driving for.
