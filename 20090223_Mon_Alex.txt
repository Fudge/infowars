[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:37.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:37.080 --> 00:45.840]  it is Monday the 23rd day of February 2009 and we're going to be live here
[00:45.840 --> 00:51.680]  for the next four hours coming up two hours from now we have the gentleman
[00:51.680 --> 00:56.380]  last week who got pulled over by a police officer detained and had a bumper
[00:56.380 --> 01:02.480]  sticker saying abort Obama not babies obviously saying get him out of office so
[01:02.480 --> 01:07.320]  he won't push infanticide he's the only Democrat in the Senate who actually
[01:07.320 --> 01:12.400]  pushed for babies to be allowed to be killed after they're born that is on
[01:12.400 --> 01:19.800]  record and so we're gonna be talking to him coming up in a few hours also we've
[01:19.800 --> 01:23.920]  had a lot of dirty tricks being played on us that I don't want to spend time on
[01:23.920 --> 01:29.360]  air because you know we have work to do people to warn news to cover films to
[01:29.360 --> 01:36.680]  make but I've seen some press reports about Obama people attacking cars that
[01:36.680 --> 01:41.160]  have second amendment bumper stickers or Republican bumper stickers or anti
[01:41.160 --> 01:48.480]  Obama stickers and then I was made aware of the Obama forum and this is one of
[01:48.480 --> 01:53.280]  the places that's had to pull some of their previous material where they would
[01:53.280 --> 01:58.560]  post some of the things that some Obama supporters that had had done to people
[01:58.560 --> 02:02.960]  and just last week I told my guys to go to the way back machine or one of the
[02:02.960 --> 02:08.400]  archives sites and pull some of the things that they've been doing and
[02:08.400 --> 02:15.560]  saying but the Obama forum which is a quite large it's quote grassroots
[02:15.560 --> 02:22.200]  action is calling for the shutdown of this radio show and they go through dirty
[02:22.200 --> 02:28.800]  tricks that they're going to use to do it listen guys if you were ever
[02:28.800 --> 02:34.440]  successful in actually hurting me you would be assured of being sued I have
[02:34.440 --> 02:38.400]  sued four people I've won every time I'm not litigious but if I go to war with
[02:38.400 --> 02:42.920]  you legally I'm going to win because I'll file three simultaneous lawsuits on
[02:42.920 --> 02:48.760]  three different issues and they'll all be the lawyers will be directed by me and
[02:48.760 --> 02:54.880]  I've studied libel in depth and I will defeat you because the very definition
[02:54.880 --> 02:58.600]  of libel you will always be convicted of it you will always be found guilty
[02:58.600 --> 03:06.200]  civilly of it is trying to lie about someone to hurt them to hurt their
[03:06.200 --> 03:10.640]  political speech or financially but I know people that mess with me never
[03:10.640 --> 03:17.920]  listened they just have to find out for themselves and number one you're not
[03:17.920 --> 03:24.240]  going to be successful but if you are successful in any forms of terrorism
[03:24.240 --> 03:32.280]  financial terrorism or anything along those lines I will own you I will have
[03:32.280 --> 03:36.200]  a judgment on your house I will have a judgment on your car I will get a
[03:36.200 --> 03:46.480]  judgment on you now I'm so busy with other issues that I'm not gonna focus
[03:46.480 --> 03:51.040]  too much on this it's just remember the newscast out of Missouri and Illinois and
[03:51.040 --> 03:55.720]  several other states that we played here on air people couldn't believe it where
[03:55.720 --> 03:58.320]  the police were on the news and prosecutors saying if you talk about
[03:58.320 --> 04:04.760]  about Obama we'll decide if it's a lie or not and prosecute you so I want that
[04:04.760 --> 04:07.840]  in the article that Paul Watson or Steve Watson or Curtin and one of our guys
[04:07.840 --> 04:15.240]  does about this report because we suspected these guys this group the
[04:15.240 --> 04:18.440]  Obama forum or one like it for some of the other things that have been going
[04:18.440 --> 04:22.920]  on around here but we appreciate them coming out of the open with this because
[04:22.920 --> 04:30.920]  that'll really really help us in court now I understand you guys are very
[04:30.920 --> 04:34.640]  proud of Obama saying the secret arrest will continue and the people at the
[04:34.640 --> 04:38.960]  camps have no rights that was AP this weekend always protecting George Bush

[08:17.120 --> 08:27.080]  and now live from Austin Texas alex jones it is the 23rd day of February
[08:27.080 --> 08:33.320]  2009 we're gonna be here for the next four hours I didn't intend this show
[08:33.320 --> 08:39.520]  today to turn into a example of the obonnoids trying to ban free speech
[08:39.520 --> 08:43.720]  in the United States they've introduced bills that would effectively ban many
[08:43.720 --> 08:48.240]  forms of speech and let federal boards decide what is arrestable and what isn't
[08:48.240 --> 08:52.080]  an end of the first amendment they're moving to set up internet to to shut
[08:52.080 --> 08:56.200]  down the old web mainstream news is announcing that but saying how great it
[08:56.200 --> 09:01.800]  is the head of homeland security and others are talking about trying to pass
[09:01.800 --> 09:05.320]  the violent radicalization act where again a federal board will decide what
[09:05.320 --> 09:11.400]  speech to ban what speech to allow the FCC is moving publicly and scores of
[09:11.400 --> 09:15.120]  senators and in the White House are calling for the quote reinstatement of
[09:15.120 --> 09:19.360]  the fairness doctrine not just over talk radio but over newspapers and the
[09:19.360 --> 09:28.080]  internet that is all happening right now meanwhile when people see what
[09:28.080 --> 09:30.880]  Obama supporters are doing they have trouble believing that it's actually
[09:30.880 --> 09:34.120]  happening remember back during the last two months of the campaign when
[09:34.120 --> 09:39.760]  Illinois Missouri Vermont a few other places had people being arrested for
[09:39.760 --> 09:46.080]  criticizing Obama like we have videos of huge public demonstrations for him
[09:46.080 --> 09:50.040]  that were non permitted and a few people come out and start speaking out
[09:50.040 --> 09:53.120]  peacefully against Obama and the police tell him leave or we're going to arrest
[09:53.120 --> 09:58.200]  you we have all these prosecutors and police in newscast saying no it's true
[09:58.200 --> 10:02.960]  if you criticize Obama we will decide if it's a lie or not and we will have you
[10:02.960 --> 10:11.440]  arrest it I mean this is really going on and now he's president and I had trouble
[10:11.440 --> 10:14.280]  believing Webster Tarpley when he said it would get this bad but I guess he's
[10:14.280 --> 10:18.760]  right so I'm gonna try to get him to pop in on the show today remember Webster
[10:18.760 --> 10:21.800]  Tarpley is now being called a right wing fascist this is the guy that wrote the
[10:21.800 --> 10:26.640]  unauthorized biography of George H. W. Bush and could only be called what I
[10:26.640 --> 10:32.360]  would call a progressive I mean he believes in big government he does not
[10:32.360 --> 10:36.760]  like Barack Obama but the point is they've been doing little dirty tricks to
[10:36.760 --> 10:42.520]  him and others and now we have all these Obama sites like the Obama forum
[10:42.520 --> 10:50.560]  calling for dirty tricks and to shut my sites down and a lot more and they say
[10:50.560 --> 10:53.840]  that they're filing complaints with the federal government to have our sites
[10:53.840 --> 10:58.760]  shut down and they're these are serious posts these are these are forum
[10:58.760 --> 11:05.120]  moderators and then some of the main honchos over at the Obama forum they
[11:05.120 --> 11:11.520]  say they want campaign for liberty Ron Paul forums John Burt society Lou
[11:11.520 --> 11:17.400]  Rockwell libertarian party info wars dot com info wars dot net prison planet
[11:17.400 --> 11:24.520]  dot com prison planet TV and they're not joking around about this and then they
[11:24.520 --> 11:28.360]  go on the sites and also post all the other forms of harassment they're
[11:28.360 --> 11:34.920]  meeting out to the general public just absolutely unamerican and what we'd
[11:34.920 --> 11:44.000]  expect to see in Germany back in the early 40s and late 30s and in Russia and
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.560]  they don't want to hear about how Obama lied and appointed nothing but lobbyist
[11:47.560 --> 11:51.920]  or how he doesn't let people read the bills when he promised he would or how
[11:51.920 --> 11:56.440]  he's increasing the troops or how he's expanding the secret arrest and torture
[11:56.440 --> 12:01.240]  and that was in the Associated Press this week that the Supreme Court had
[12:01.240 --> 12:04.840]  ruled that they had to give people constitutional protections in the Geneva
[12:04.840 --> 12:10.200]  Convention in the background airbase in afghanistan and bases in iraq and other
[12:10.200 --> 12:15.360]  ghost sites around the world and Obama put in an executive directive over the
[12:15.360 --> 12:19.120]  weekend actually Friday saying that this will not be followed we're following
[12:19.120 --> 12:24.960]  the Bush doctrine and I was downtown Thursday interviewing Obama supporters
[12:24.960 --> 12:28.880]  to get a few more little comments for the Obama deception film which will be
[12:28.880 --> 12:38.000]  done by the end of the week and you know they just don't care ladies and
[12:38.000 --> 12:51.240]  gentlemen they just don't care they want censorship and they want it now I was
[12:51.240 --> 12:54.200]  down there talking to these people and I would list all the things he's done all
[12:54.200 --> 13:00.240]  the lies and they just didn't want to hear it they just don't care it was just
[13:00.240 --> 13:03.760]  like George Bush supporters when he was busy butchering the Bill of Rights and
[13:03.760 --> 13:08.240]  Constitution following the exact same agenda because these men are just front
[13:08.240 --> 13:13.320]  puppets and it they don't care and you know a lot of people last year when it
[13:13.320 --> 13:15.960]  came out of the news that police were threatening to arrest people that
[13:15.960 --> 13:19.360]  criticized Obama they couldn't believe it and they accused us of it being a
[13:19.360 --> 13:24.720]  hoax and then it the police went on the news and the prosecutors went on the
[13:24.720 --> 13:31.440]  news and said no we are going to arrest you in fact I want to play that again I
[13:31.440 --> 13:37.160]  know Paul Watson did an article on it that has the YouTube clip of the news
[13:37.160 --> 13:44.680]  of the different newscast let's pull that up officials to arrest those
[13:44.680 --> 13:49.080]  criticizing Obama Google that for me and pull up a YouTube on that because
[13:49.080 --> 13:52.840]  I mean it's kind of like when we had the press reports of how they were
[13:52.840 --> 13:58.160]  hiring 26,000 preachers to covertly go under FEMA control to teach their flocks
[13:58.160 --> 14:01.760]  to hand in their guns and go into FEMA camps and nobody believed it we even we
[14:01.760 --> 14:06.040]  have the secret documents with FEMA phone numbers on it and then it came out
[14:06.040 --> 14:11.360]  of the mainstream news but it is hard to believe that the Obama forum and a
[14:11.360 --> 14:18.920]  bunch of these other forums are serious I mean one wants to believe there are
[14:18.920 --> 14:24.840]  hoax or a joke but regardless people are taking this stuff serious and things
[14:24.840 --> 14:31.880]  are being done to this operation so we will go over that here on the broadcast
[14:31.880 --> 14:39.400]  today and we know what happened to Chip Harrison pulled over for anti-Obama
[14:39.400 --> 14:43.520]  sign on car sign confiscated later return secret service paid him a visit
[14:43.520 --> 14:47.480]  and asked him to look around his house to see if he was part of a hate group I
[14:47.480 --> 14:51.160]  mean that's the daily Oklahoma that happened he's coming on in an hour and
[14:51.160 --> 14:57.720]  45 minutes here on the show you know I remember a year ago talking about how
[14:57.720 --> 15:01.080]  Obama supporters were planning to reinstate the fairness doctrine restrict
[15:01.080 --> 15:03.960]  free speech people said oh that's not true that's not happening now it's in the
[15:03.960 --> 15:10.640]  New York Times the Washington Post saying yo yes we need to reinstate it and
[15:10.640 --> 15:14.240]  they've lined up all these senators and house members and they got editorials
[15:14.240 --> 15:23.200]  and major publications everywhere saying banned people show like mine so it is
[15:23.200 --> 15:31.920]  happening ladies and gentlemen it is real this is a real situation that we
[15:31.920 --> 15:41.760]  are facing in other news remember last Friday I had a Lieutenant Colonel on
[15:41.760 --> 15:53.600]  the show the spokesman for the National Guard now federalized in Iowa and he
[15:53.600 --> 15:57.560]  admitted that yes the Iowa National Guard was in New Orleans for the gun
[15:57.560 --> 16:03.120]  confiscation but he went on to say that he didn't think they'd ever have to be
[16:03.120 --> 16:09.200]  given that order but it defend but it depended on the situation in the
[16:09.200 --> 16:15.760]  country to see what they would do and in the local press report compiled via an
[16:15.760 --> 16:19.880]  interview with the military they said yeah we're gonna lock down the town of
[16:19.880 --> 16:23.840]  Arcadia in Iowa and another town and we're gonna practice taking the town
[16:23.840 --> 16:26.840]  over and go door-to-door and ask people about what type of weapons they have and
[16:26.840 --> 16:37.680]  you know do they know where weapons dealers are and then I have all these
[16:37.680 --> 16:40.600]  other reports about Marine Corps and Army drills around the nation where they
[16:40.600 --> 16:44.360]  send the reports well this could be for the US or this could be for overseas and
[16:44.360 --> 16:47.640]  you know we've got the helicopters and the armored vehicles in here so that our
[16:47.640 --> 16:56.600]  forces get familiarized with the area in fact that's in an article Paul Watson
[16:56.600 --> 17:02.960]  wrote today that we'll get to in a moment but National Guard scraps plans to
[17:02.960 --> 17:10.440]  invade rural town this operation could be pretty intrusive to people that's the
[17:10.440 --> 17:15.840]  world-net daily headline from Friday evening when they picked up on the
[17:15.840 --> 17:20.000]  story following publicized reports at the Army National Guard was planning a
[17:20.000 --> 17:23.040]  military training exercise in the streets of the rural Iowa town the
[17:23.040 --> 17:27.520]  commanding officers have called off the mock invasion the guard had planned a
[17:27.520 --> 17:32.160]  four-day urban military operation the tiny Arcadia Iowa population 443
[17:32.160 --> 17:35.360]  sending troops to take over the town and search door-to-door for suspected
[17:35.360 --> 17:39.480]  weapons dealer the exercise was designed as a mock scenario to give
[17:39.480 --> 17:42.600]  soldiers the skills needed for deployment in urban environment and
[17:42.600 --> 17:47.160]  military official stress that only households that consented to be part of
[17:47.160 --> 17:53.240]  the drill would be searched yeah they said they go to your door and ask if it
[17:53.240 --> 17:57.120]  was okay if they searched and that they would set up checkpoints blocking in the
[17:57.120 --> 18:02.800]  town and then they have real towns in places like Arkansas where the entire
[18:02.800 --> 18:07.160]  town is quote under martial law that's the police chief this has been on CNN
[18:07.160 --> 18:11.280]  and that they search everyone 24 hours a day when they try to leave their
[18:11.280 --> 18:19.800]  neighborhood see this is happening everywhere ladies and gentlemen it was
[18:19.800 --> 18:22.520]  important for us to gain the trust and confidence the residents of Arcadia
[18:22.520 --> 18:26.440]  Sergeant Mike Knott's readiness in CEO for Alpha company told Carroll's daily
[18:26.440 --> 18:30.040]  times arrow we will need to identify individuals that are willing to assist

[24:23.280 --> 24:29.040]  colonel hat good we interviewed Friday told world at daily Iowans he explained
[24:29.040 --> 24:33.240]  typically cooperate with the guard oh in the mock gun confiscation drills the
[24:33.240 --> 24:37.200]  change in plans to scale back the operation was based on troop evaluation
[24:37.200 --> 24:41.840]  he said not public outcry I mean how insulting is that to your intelligence
[24:41.840 --> 24:48.360]  but see when you know how they operate you know it's deception and for those
[24:48.360 --> 24:51.880]  that care about our military much of my military much of my family's in the
[24:51.880 --> 24:56.200]  military I know we've had a good military in the past you should be angry
[24:56.200 --> 25:00.400]  about this and be saying no to this so the globalist can't turn our military
[25:00.400 --> 25:07.120]  into a thug force like they are in North Korea or Mexico or Russia today
[25:07.720 --> 25:12.400]  higher headquarters leadership have good told world at daily's given the unit
[25:12.400 --> 25:16.600]  status of training proficiency made a decision to scale back the exercise but
[25:16.600 --> 25:23.080]  when they separately talked to military spokesman sergeant Mike knots readiness
[25:23.080 --> 25:27.520]  in co for alpha company he said we will need to identify individuals that are
[25:27.520 --> 25:30.520]  willing to assist us in training by allowing us to search their homes and
[25:30.520 --> 25:34.480]  vehicles and to participate in role-playing we really want to get as
[25:34.480 --> 25:38.040]  much information out there's possible knots continued because this operation
[25:38.040 --> 25:42.520]  can be pretty intrusive to the people of Arcadia and that's why it's being
[25:42.520 --> 25:50.640]  scaled back not because oh suddenly we don't have the troops to do it now we
[25:50.640 --> 25:56.280]  just decided knots described the original operation to the Herald is set to
[25:56.280 --> 26:00.000]  begin Thursday April 2nd with reconnaissance and exploratory patrols
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.320]  on April 4th convoys will be deployed from the armory in Carroll to nearby
[26:04.320 --> 26:10.640]  Arcadia when soldiers would knock on doors showing a picture of the invented
[26:10.640 --> 26:19.640]  arms dealer now folks we've got footage in my film police state 2000
[26:19.640 --> 26:23.600]  of course the Marines and Army training to confiscate guns with role-players
[26:23.600 --> 26:27.640]  screaming I'm an American please know not the camp and mock interrogations
[26:27.640 --> 26:30.120]  where they say I'm an American and they're asking where you from oh I'm
[26:30.120 --> 26:38.360]  from San Francisco then we have footage in Hebron Maryland this is in 1998 where
[26:38.360 --> 26:44.160]  the Marines walk over to citizens from the town and tell them turn their
[26:44.160 --> 26:49.520]  cameras off with the police chief in tow ordering them around and then they
[26:49.520 --> 26:56.120]  got video of 10 to 13 year old children in white t-shirts on bikes being told
[26:56.120 --> 26:59.920]  by the Marines to look for the gun dealers and report who's got guns in
[26:59.920 --> 27:04.680]  their houses and it was all being done as if this was for the United States then
[27:04.680 --> 27:08.520]  of course we have the 29 Palm Survey will you fire on US citizens have ordered
[27:08.520 --> 27:13.240]  to during gun confiscation and then now the Pentagon admits they're preparing the
[27:13.240 --> 27:17.760]  Marines and the Army to patrol America and quote deal with insurrection and
[27:17.760 --> 27:22.680]  rebellion John Ward Defense Authorization Act PDD 51 the New
[27:22.680 --> 27:27.040]  Pentagon Directives Army Times Washington Post you know people are still
[27:27.040 --> 27:30.320]  calling and emailing me saying oh Alex they're not training for that oh this
[27:30.320 --> 27:35.560]  isn't happening cut out your conspiracy theories and I'm sorry who do you stand
[27:35.560 --> 27:39.000]  with the second amendment or do you stand with the military that's been
[27:39.000 --> 27:44.840]  taken over by the globalist I talked to the military and they hope that you as
[27:44.840 --> 27:48.240]  civilians will yell and scream and make a stink out of this politically which is
[27:48.240 --> 27:53.400]  your job and duty so that they're not put in this treasonous position and I'll
[27:53.400 --> 27:56.880]  tell you this the American people are just as treasonous for sitting on their
[27:56.880 --> 28:02.400]  hind ends and letting this country turn into this you want to know whose fault
[28:02.400 --> 28:08.280]  this is look in the mirror all of us myself included look in the mirror you
[28:08.280 --> 28:11.440]  want to blame the police you want to blame the military you want to blame
[28:11.440 --> 28:14.640]  the federal government and certainly if the federal government's directing all
[28:14.640 --> 28:19.400]  this and totally criminal but in the final equation it's our job to stop
[28:19.400 --> 28:23.760]  this and it doesn't matter what it takes politically if we take action and
[28:23.760 --> 28:28.720]  educate the public and say no to this there's no army on earth that can
[28:28.720 --> 28:33.440]  dominate the U.S. and bring us into a socialist tyranny
[28:37.840 --> 28:42.360]  one of the techniques we use in today's political environment is to cordon and
[28:42.360 --> 28:45.920]  knock knots explained the sergeant we asked for the head of the household get
[28:45.920 --> 28:50.320]  permission to search then have them open their doors and cupboards the homeowner
[28:50.320 --> 28:54.000]  maintains control that's double-speak you know you're not under control they're
[28:54.000 --> 28:58.040]  under control we peer over their shoulder and the soldier uses the home
[28:58.040 --> 29:02.320]  owners body language in position to protect him from the homeowner that's
[29:02.320 --> 29:07.760]  what that means the plan drill has also included overheard supervision from a
[29:07.760 --> 29:12.800]  blackwater helicopter overhead supervision from a black Hawk helicopter crowd
[29:12.800 --> 29:16.840]  control measures and simulated extraction of injured people culminating in the
[29:16.840 --> 29:21.240]  capture of the arms dealer you know the feds are paying for drills all over the
[29:21.240 --> 29:26.640]  country with local police as the AP covered in Michigan where they call the
[29:26.640 --> 29:31.240]  middle school students out blow up a bus in front of them with flashbangs and
[29:31.240 --> 29:35.280]  smoke it out in some cases your detectives actually catch the cars on fire
[29:35.280 --> 29:39.760]  and then tell the children we're going to kill you where we're home schoolers
[29:39.760 --> 29:42.960]  and brainwash them against the Second Amendment and homeschoolers I'm not
[29:42.960 --> 29:46.760]  kidding and the kids don't even know what's gonna happen it traumatizes them
[29:46.760 --> 29:49.440]  we'll talk about that when we get back and a lot more what's happening with the
[29:49.440 --> 29:56.760]  economy we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN

[34:41.760 --> 34:48.680]  and people couldn't believe it but that is that is coming up later we're
[34:48.680 --> 34:56.480]  going to find that and play it now Paul Watson has done a story that's up on
[34:56.480 --> 35:03.600]  prism planet calm urban warfare drills linked to coming economic rage now he's
[35:03.600 --> 35:08.640]  quoting mainstream news here's the mail online British newspaper police fear
[35:08.640 --> 35:13.960]  mass protest and a summer of rage in response to economic crises and you'd
[35:13.960 --> 35:17.280]  be hiding under a rock if you haven't seen all the world leaders saying we're
[35:17.280 --> 35:20.760]  going to have riots we're going to have economic collapse we're going to have you
[35:20.760 --> 35:24.160]  know civil insurrection like they've had basically in Iceland with the
[35:24.160 --> 35:28.800]  government falling over the weekend several eastern European governments
[35:28.800 --> 35:34.240]  fell we'll get into that and last week is a big new brazilian MSNBC I never got
[35:34.240 --> 35:37.200]  around to playing the clip but we did post it on the sites maybe we'll play
[35:37.200 --> 35:43.080]  part of that John Q that up from Friday police but it ties into all of this
[35:43.080 --> 35:48.440]  urban warfare drills linked to coming economic rage Paul Joseph Watson
[35:48.440 --> 35:51.980]  urban warfare training drills are taking place across the country as top
[35:51.980 --> 35:56.160]  analyst as well as officials predict a potential summer of rage across Europe
[35:56.160 --> 36:01.080]  and America is civil unrest from economic fallout builds earlier this month
[36:01.080 --> 36:06.440]  150 US troops from the US special operations command whizzed around the
[36:06.440 --> 36:09.880]  streets of New Orleans and military helicopters and even dropped bombs
[36:09.880 --> 36:13.080]  that's a mainstream news story we have a link to there and what officials
[36:13.080 --> 36:16.760]  described as a training event an Iowa National Guard training exercise in
[36:16.760 --> 36:21.480]  Arcadia Iowa scheduled for April was originally billed as a quote invasion
[36:21.480 --> 36:26.000]  before public opposition caused the drill to be scaled back they're not going
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.920]  to scale it back the exercise included guard troops patrolling streets
[36:29.920 --> 36:35.040]  searching homes and confiscating firearms no less than 2,200 US marines
[36:35.040 --> 36:38.760]  were also involved in urban operations training in Richmond Virginia we have a
[36:38.760 --> 36:42.160]  link to the mainstream article and photos there throughout January drills
[36:42.160 --> 36:46.720]  involved landing troops in populated areas and allowing military pilots this
[36:46.720 --> 36:52.880]  is a quote to familiarize themselves with the area military choppers hovered
[36:52.880 --> 36:58.400]  precariously low over parking lots as citizens were acclimated to seeing active
[36:58.400 --> 37:03.680]  duty military assets carry out their activities watch a clip filmed by a
[37:03.680 --> 37:07.200]  startled Richmond resident who wasn't even aware the marines were conducting
[37:07.200 --> 37:12.320]  drills who to scant fourth warning on behalf of authorities in the media we
[37:12.320 --> 37:16.640]  have a video clip right there are such drills really for the purpose of
[37:16.640 --> 37:20.880]  preparing troops for foreign combat zones undoubtedly but other factors
[37:20.880 --> 37:25.200]  indicate that the drills may very well be aimed at preparing troops for dealing
[37:25.200 --> 37:29.440]  with mass civil unrest and economic crisis worsens well I mean the Pentagon
[37:29.440 --> 37:34.200]  said that Paul there are me people say we exaggerate we actually hold back it's
[37:34.200 --> 37:38.760]  worse than Paul's writing here there's no question the US authorities have been
[37:38.760 --> 37:42.480]  closely observing riots that have toppled governments in Iceland and
[37:42.480 --> 37:46.200]  Latvia and also threatened to do so in several other European countries the
[37:46.200 --> 37:50.680]  fact that they have contingency plans in place to deal with such scenarios should
[37:50.680 --> 37:55.720]  the they unfold in America cannot be disputed yeah I have articles today of
[37:55.720 --> 37:58.880]  mainstream news about Mexico already collapsing it's basically collapsing
[37:58.880 --> 38:03.560]  right now Mexico folks a hundred million people south the border they have put
[38:03.560 --> 38:08.120]  homeland security and a National Guard on the Texas border I was getting rumors
[38:08.120 --> 38:12.560]  of this Thursday and Friday it's now come out in mainstream news as well as
[38:12.560 --> 38:14.880]  the
[38:14.880 --> 38:21.680]  oh what's the Times magazine down in El Paso El Paso Times that they are
[38:21.680 --> 38:24.680]  standing by to close the southern border so that is confirmed everybody
[38:24.680 --> 38:28.200]  wondering about that that's confirmed meanwhile millions of dollars that
[38:28.200 --> 38:31.920]  were set aside as part of the so-called bailout have in fact been handed over to
[38:31.920 --> 38:35.400]  local police departments and spent on military tools like armored vehicles
[38:35.400 --> 38:39.520]  unmanned aerial surveillance drones and high-powered firearms for SWAT teams
[38:39.520 --> 38:44.240]  you know like semi-automatic 50 cows in addition with many predicting that
[38:44.240 --> 38:48.720]  Mexico's on the verge of collapse as a result of the economic crisis in the
[38:48.720 --> 38:51.800]  out-of-control drug war Texas officials have already established contingency
[38:51.800 --> 38:55.400]  plans to deal with the influx of immigrants a program that would only
[38:55.400 --> 39:00.040]  address law enforcement concerns and non-humanitarian needs HR 645
[39:00.040 --> 39:03.760]  otherwise known as the National Emergency Centers Establishment Act would
[39:03.760 --> 39:07.600]  mandate the expansion of FEMA detention camps which would likely be used to
[39:07.600 --> 39:10.680]  detain illegal immigrants as well as rioting American citizens well they've
[39:10.680 --> 39:14.480]  said that's what they're for the prospect of widespread rioting at some
[39:14.480 --> 39:19.360]  stage this year is a scenario feared by many
[39:19.360 --> 39:26.560]  police in the UK are preparing for the summer of rage as mass protest against
[39:26.560 --> 39:30.960]  the mishandling of the economic crisis by government the US Army War College in
[39:30.960 --> 39:35.320]  November released a white paper called known unknowns unconventional
[39:35.320 --> 39:41.520]  strategic shocks and defense strategy development the report warned that the
[39:41.520 --> 39:45.880]  military must be prepared for a quote violent strategic dislocation inside the
[39:45.880 --> 39:50.120]  United States which could be provoked by unforeseen economic collapse purposeful
[39:50.120 --> 39:54.240]  domestic resistance oh you don't want to lose your farm and ranch you don't want
[39:54.240 --> 39:58.240]  to have your children conscripted to have an Iranian war oh I'm gonna read that
[39:58.240 --> 40:01.880]  again violent strategic dislocation inside the United States these are quotes
[40:01.880 --> 40:07.160]  which could be provoked by unforeseen economic collapse purposeful domestic
[40:07.160 --> 40:11.840]  resistance none of us want to go have a fight with the military and the police
[40:11.840 --> 40:16.440]  but you're you're putting people in a position where they will fight back I
[40:16.440 --> 40:20.320]  mean I wouldn't want your job military or police I mean I'm telling you not
[40:20.320 --> 40:24.680]  stick your hand in a rattlesnake hole I'm your friend I mean the foreign
[40:24.680 --> 40:28.600]  bankers and hijackers like I told you they were gonna do and this is what
[40:28.600 --> 40:33.440]  follows tyranny which could be provoked by unforeseen economic collapse
[40:33.440 --> 40:37.520]  purposeful domestic resistance pervasive public health emergencies or loss of
[40:37.520 --> 40:42.400]  functioning political and legal order the widespread civil violence the
[40:42.400 --> 40:46.560]  document said would force the defense establishment to reiterate and reorient
[40:46.560 --> 40:56.920]  priorities in extremes to defend basic domestic order and human security see
[40:56.920 --> 41:01.040]  they're creating a global crisis which will sell the public on military
[41:01.040 --> 41:05.200]  occupation it will look reasonable as the borders are being overrun as things
[41:05.200 --> 41:10.000]  are collapsing and there's a very good chance this is already underway well I
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.640]  mean we got 30 million illegals at a point across the last decade of course
[41:12.640 --> 41:16.240]  it's already underway but numerous other public figures including senator
[41:16.240 --> 41:23.440]  Christopher Dodd leading economist Nobel Norel Robini top trend forecaster
[41:23.440 --> 41:26.320]  Gerald Salente they head of the International Monetary Fund they have
[41:26.320 --> 41:29.000]  of the world trade organization the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[41:29.000 --> 41:32.360]  former national security advisors of Igna Brzezinski and director of the
[41:32.360 --> 41:36.640]  national intelligence denisee Blair have all warned of coming civil unrest and
[41:36.640 --> 41:40.760]  global instability Paul Watson has just written an incredible article here
[41:40.760 --> 41:47.640]  considering the expectancy for riots it would be naive to dismiss the notion that
[41:47.640 --> 41:50.840]  the increasing amount of urban warfare drills taking place across the US are
[41:50.840 --> 41:55.200]  not at least partially to prepare trips to undertake law enforcement duties
[41:55.200 --> 41:59.680]  should civil unrest as a consequence of the economic fallout threaten a
[41:59.680 --> 42:06.000]  collapse in social order you know what I had that lieutenant colonel on Greg
[42:06.000 --> 42:12.680]  hapgood Friday I was really interrogating him and I had such an
[42:12.680 --> 42:18.080]  in-depth knowledge of their operations from decades of study that I can tell
[42:18.080 --> 42:24.560]  you a he is a patriot the man loves this country and bleeds red white and blue he
[42:24.560 --> 42:29.000]  began to break down and you can hear him start crying if you listen carefully on
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.560]  air he had to hold back crying because he did not like having to deceive the
[42:33.560 --> 42:38.320]  people and he was deceiving and he's been told everything's gonna collapse and
[42:38.320 --> 42:41.840]  he's got to do this and he is very upset he's thinking about granddaddy
[42:41.840 --> 42:45.000]  sitting on his knee and saying son a time's gonna come when they're gonna
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.840]  come after these shotguns and rifles every good grandfather told their
[42:48.840 --> 42:53.880]  grandson that and you've got to resist it when that time comes and that's why he
[42:53.880 --> 42:57.840]  started cracking up I was in his mind at that time basically I studied this so
[42:57.840 --> 43:03.680]  much and that's why he began started listen I'm not good because he was
[43:03.680 --> 43:08.640]  about to break down and join the republic he was inches away and that's
[43:08.640 --> 43:13.960]  why this is going to fail ladies and gentlemen all this preparation all this
[43:13.960 --> 43:19.800]  propaganda the new order has done isn't going to fly they are it is not going to
[43:19.800 --> 43:23.640]  work but I assure you they're gonna bring this country into the depths of
[43:23.640 --> 43:29.880]  breakdown and insanity and danger to try to break your will police and
[43:29.880 --> 43:37.360]  military to sell you on going along with this but it's not just an
[43:37.360 --> 43:41.720]  intellectual issue or a historical issue search your gut search your
[43:41.720 --> 43:46.120]  instincts search your soul and you know I'm telling you the truth and you know
[43:46.120 --> 43:50.600]  we're on record you know there is a internal debate in the alternative
[43:50.600 --> 43:55.200]  media and it's a public debate but it's also an internal debate about whether
[43:55.200 --> 44:00.800]  this economic collapse is was planned and organized by design ladies and
[44:00.800 --> 44:07.920]  gentlemen let the debate end here and now okay let that debate in here and now
[44:07.920 --> 44:15.080]  I'm not tuning my horn I do five or six hours of research a day from source
[44:15.080 --> 44:19.200]  government documents I was up here last night doing I understand their
[44:19.200 --> 44:23.200]  operations I've seen with the IMF and World Bank and the Anglo-American Empire
[44:23.200 --> 44:27.800]  have done in hundreds of third world countries in the last century I've read
[44:27.800 --> 44:32.760]  their handbooks their army filled manuals we've posted them all State
[44:32.760 --> 44:39.640]  Department memorandum 200 CIA directive memorandum 200 all of it and so it is
[44:39.640 --> 44:45.200]  not my opinion when I tell you this is staged it is absolute in
[44:45.200 --> 44:59.680]  controversial fact it is a guarantee one hundred and ten percent now let me
[44:59.680 --> 45:04.240]  just break this down briefly so there's no more denial about this number one we
[45:04.240 --> 45:07.400]  been on record for at least a decade saying that the banks were going to pop
[45:07.400 --> 45:10.880]  the derivatives bubble they were creating through the fractional reserve
[45:10.880 --> 45:14.440]  system of that they were getting everybody in debt by design like a third
[45:14.440 --> 45:18.080]  world nation to bring us down so that then we would accept the new world order
[45:18.080 --> 45:22.160]  why did I say that because the trilateral Commission documents the club of
[45:22.160 --> 45:26.320]  Rome documents the council on farm relations documents all of these
[45:26.320 --> 45:30.400]  globalist groups said that they wanted to get everybody in debt and leverage to
[45:30.400 --> 45:34.840]  the Hilt and then implode the world economy to have global bankruptcy to
[45:34.840 --> 45:40.480]  globally reorganize the world under bankruptcy clauses where the private
[45:40.480 --> 45:47.320]  banks that engineered it and designed it rule the planet and that they would
[45:47.320 --> 45:52.640]  then announce a new bank of the world with dictatorial power over every nation
[45:52.640 --> 45:58.560]  state that is now all been announced that is we are now in the process of this
[45:58.560 --> 46:04.000]  happening you are in it we are all in it together right now I mean it's on
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.320]  record that the IMF and World Bank take US taxpayer money that's never paid back
[46:08.320 --> 46:13.200]  to us they call it aid and people can bribe and complain about hundreds and
[46:13.200 --> 46:16.080]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars of IMF and World
[46:16.080 --> 46:20.320]  Bank loans the United States puts in on average about 65% of that money a few
[46:20.320 --> 46:26.400]  other Western nations do as well it is taken in a loan loan at upwards of 30
[46:26.400 --> 46:31.280]  percent compounded interest in one case Nigeria got a two billion dollar loan
[46:31.280 --> 46:37.880]  and it's over 55 billion today they've already paid back 55 billion well two
[46:37.880 --> 46:44.240]  billion dollar loan they go in they pay off the leaders in Latin America Asia
[46:44.240 --> 46:51.000]  Eastern Europe Africa Middle East to not pay back the loans they even sign a
[46:51.000 --> 46:56.560]  110 point IMF World Bank plan that's been leaked for six years it's public we
[46:56.560 --> 47:01.080]  covered my book to send into tyranny right BBC covered it we had Greg
[47:01.080 --> 47:07.000]  Palastair who broke it and it states how they get you leveraged how they get a
[47:07.000 --> 47:09.840]  country set up how they get the governments to sign over their
[47:09.840 --> 47:14.920]  infrastructure their ports their roads their national parks to the elite and
[47:14.920 --> 47:21.280]  then the elite implode the economy by cutting off the bubble and then
[47:21.280 --> 47:25.840]  everything collapses then there's what they call the IMF riot it's in their
[47:25.840 --> 47:32.560]  documents they go we then institute the IMF riot this is a designed blueprint on
[47:32.560 --> 47:42.760]  record plan and then people riot because they don't have food or water the
[47:42.760 --> 47:47.760]  Pentagon's done studies over 90% of the public will rob and steal within five
[47:47.760 --> 47:52.960]  days four to five days of not having food and water we're then 14 to 15 days
[47:52.960 --> 48:01.080]  98% of people will kill for food and water if my children were starving to
[48:01.080 --> 48:10.480]  death I am a moral person but I love them so much that that I would probably I
[48:10.480 --> 48:15.400]  mean I mean I'm just gonna be honest folks it just look out let's see I've
[48:15.400 --> 48:20.480]  been moral I'm not putting myself in that position I have at least four years
[48:20.480 --> 48:23.880]  of storable food I have firearms now let me add if you try to take me to some
[48:23.880 --> 48:28.000]  sports stadium you try to drag me off the back of a flatback truck like they're
[48:28.000 --> 48:31.840]  doing with the military drills right now folks I'm not going there for my
[48:31.840 --> 48:36.680]  family to be raped and killed okay it's not gonna happen so back off stand down
[48:36.680 --> 48:41.000]  do the right thing yourself morally get yourselves ready and then we can
[48:41.000 --> 48:44.840]  avert this if we get ready and prepared and geared up and get the word out
[48:44.840 --> 48:48.480]  politically they will back off of this and they'll just say it was a bad
[48:48.480 --> 48:54.040]  recession there's still a few months to pull out of this they are gauging they
[48:54.040 --> 49:00.400]  are testing they are looking at things so it is on record they do this now
[49:00.400 --> 49:04.240]  what am I start telling you in 2002 along with Greg Palace and others the
[49:04.240 --> 49:08.480]  bankers have now totally bankrupt and control every major third world nation
[49:08.480 --> 49:16.080]  on earth except for what seven rogue countries Libya Pakistan Iran a few
[49:16.080 --> 49:18.480]  others whether those companies are good or bad the point is not controlled by
[49:18.480 --> 49:22.240]  the globalist so other than that they control everything they're done they
[49:22.240 --> 49:26.000]  don't need the US and Western Europe and they write all these white papers you
[49:26.000 --> 49:29.880]  hear him brag on NPR oh we live too good we've got to get ready to not live so
[49:29.880 --> 49:32.640]  well you know it's going to be a new system it's going to be a new
[49:32.640 --> 49:37.000]  authoritarian system for your own good you know I had a guy when I was on a
[49:37.000 --> 49:43.800]  radio station he goes into San Francisco I need to plug that affiliate
[49:43.800 --> 49:49.960]  they're carrying us now and a caller called and said yeah I do sound and
[49:49.960 --> 49:54.160]  video you know these big events and we were at this closed meeting of CEOs and
[49:54.160 --> 49:56.360]  Al Gore and others were there and they were saying yeah we're gonna take people's
[49:56.360 --> 50:00.240]  rights for their own good it's part of the new world order well I don't need to
[50:00.240 --> 50:04.600]  hear from somebody behind closed doors I have hundreds of mainline news stories
[50:04.600 --> 50:09.320]  like a month ago and now for world government financial times of London
[50:09.320 --> 50:13.120]  that was the headline it said yeah we've kept world government secret from you
[50:13.120 --> 50:16.320]  for your own good because you're too stupid and yes it's authoritarian and
[50:16.320 --> 50:19.240]  non-democratic but it's for your own good and the new world order is going to
[50:19.240 --> 50:27.240]  save you you see it's on record they're doing it and if we don't wake up and
[50:27.240 --> 50:31.200]  speak out and point out who the real criminals are they're going to get away
[50:31.200 --> 50:36.000]  with this and the United States as we know it will cease to exist and so will
[50:36.000 --> 50:40.360]  Europe they've already sucked us dry they're now going to implode us they are

[55:14.280 --> 55:19.440]  tube into this and I said no this is a atmospheric water generator and it
[55:19.440 --> 55:22.320]  grabs the water out of the air and puts it through seven different filters
[55:22.320 --> 55:26.880]  including reverse osmosis and they said water in the air and I said yeah from
[55:26.880 --> 55:32.680]  30,000 feet down to the ground level there is about on average 10 feet of
[55:32.680 --> 55:36.040]  water they were water and I was like yeah clouds you know if you condensed all
[55:36.040 --> 55:40.040]  the water and the first 30,000 feet of the atmosphere down it's on average a
[55:40.040 --> 55:45.560]  little bit over 10 feet of water and they didn't seem to understand that but
[55:45.560 --> 55:50.680]  they said the water tasted delicious the point is folks you ever see when

[56:14.320 --> 56:17.760]  talked about how the banks issue all this fiat currency and credit but they
[56:17.760 --> 56:21.080]  want to implode economies to be able to get the real assets and take control of
[56:21.080 --> 56:26.640]  governments and so to simplify it about a hundred years ago the british
[56:26.640 --> 56:30.280]  empire the dutch empire and others were running into a lot of resistance all
[56:30.280 --> 56:34.120]  over the world including india and places like that and they learned and
[56:34.120 --> 56:38.200]  wrote handbooks on it that they removed their regional governors and financed
[56:38.200 --> 56:42.520]  puppet revolutions or elected representatives getting into power that
[56:42.520 --> 56:45.440]  the people who put up a lot more corruption as long as it was a front
[56:45.440 --> 56:52.000]  person and then with loans with economic aid first millions and then
[56:52.000 --> 56:57.120]  billions of dollars per nation they would get financial control over the
[56:57.120 --> 57:02.360]  country but they want to give the country's money to actually build up an
[57:02.360 --> 57:06.520]  infrastructure and then be self-sufficient independent no it was
[57:06.520 --> 57:09.680]  done with strings attached with corrupt politicians to make sure they didn't pay
[57:09.680 --> 57:13.160]  it back and very simply that's what's happened here you know why does
[57:13.160 --> 57:17.080]  australia and england in the u.s. and germany and many latin american
[57:17.080 --> 57:20.480]  countries in african countries have the same curriculum same school was because
[57:20.480 --> 57:25.400]  they've taken u.n. money or they've signed u.n. treaties and their curriculum is
[57:25.400 --> 57:30.880]  all based on unesco the united nations educational and cultural organization
[57:30.880 --> 57:34.840]  and that's just one microcosm if a state takes federal money they've got to
[57:34.840 --> 57:41.320]  agree to international zoning rules which then unify laws where the banks and
[57:41.320 --> 57:44.560]  others can steal your property for no reason if you've got three inch grass
[57:44.560 --> 57:48.960]  you know that's why all this is happening in fact the austrian american
[57:48.960 --> 57:55.120]  statesman i was walking out of k lbj 590 right at the syndicated Sunday show
[57:55.120 --> 57:59.640]  and i heard the news girl recording a spot about how they are illegally taking
[57:59.640 --> 58:05.080]  people's blood in texas and using it for research at birth and i said excuse me
[58:05.080 --> 58:08.760]  i'm sorry you know bird where did you get that because i've been reporting on
[58:08.760 --> 58:12.720]  this for almost 14 years and she said here it is in the austrian american
[58:12.720 --> 58:18.480]  statesman you didn't see it and i have that article it's actually out of my
[58:18.480 --> 58:22.360]  car but i'm gonna go get that and cover that later in the show because here's
[58:22.360 --> 58:27.400]  the issue that's an international treaty for 36 years all of our blood in
[58:27.400 --> 58:32.880]  every major nation has been taken and put in an international database and they
[58:32.880 --> 58:36.480]  use it to develop bio weapons race-specific bio weapons they claim
[58:36.480 --> 58:41.640]  they own your dna code now and the public's finally finding it out

[1:00:12.360 --> 1:00:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.880 --> 1:00:28.440]  Alex Jones we are back live ladies and gentlemen now into our number two an
[1:00:28.440 --> 1:00:31.800]  hour from now we're joined by the gentleman who was detained and had his
[1:00:31.800 --> 1:00:35.280]  bumper sticker taken and then was visited by the Secret Service who without
[1:00:35.280 --> 1:00:38.920]  a warrant went in his house we're having a anti-Obama sticker on his car
[1:00:38.920 --> 1:00:42.560]  according to the Daily Oklahoma that's coming up in the next segment Webster
[1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:45.640]  Griffin Tarp was going to join us chronicling all the different forms of
[1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:51.160]  First Amendment censorship exploding under Obama but right now let's go ahead
[1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:56.800]  and play a clip from CNN because well the first clip is actually from local
[1:00:56.800 --> 1:01:01.360]  Kansas news and we're analyzing these pieces because when we first broke this
[1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:06.960]  news story because Kansas City listeners of this show and others had heard
[1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:10.720]  about it locally no one believed us and said it was a hoax then the governor
[1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:16.040]  came out and said quote Missouri governor RNC Obama campaign has stench of
[1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:19.600]  police state and said this is completely illegal and like the Soviet Union or
[1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:25.200]  Nazi Germany and we then were able to have some folks from the governor's
[1:01:25.200 --> 1:01:30.760]  office on about that as well so let's go ahead and play a clip of that because
[1:01:30.760 --> 1:01:32.240]  people don't believe this is happening
[1:01:32.240 --> 1:01:36.000]  Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign is asking Missouri law
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:40.680]  enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading television ad
[1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:44.120]  during the presidential campaign this was John Mills is live at the county
[1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:47.280]  election board in Maplewood he's been learning more about which members of
[1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:50.880]  law enforcement are getting involved in this John tell us more about this
[1:01:50.880 --> 1:01:55.480]  Russell good evening prosecutors and sheriffs from across Missouri are
[1:01:55.480 --> 1:01:59.600]  joining something called the Barack Obama truth squad two high-profile
[1:01:59.600 --> 1:02:04.760]  prosecutors are part of the team we met them this afternoon in the Central West
[1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:09.280]  and they are Jennifer Joyce from the city Bob McCullough the St. Louis County
[1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:13.360]  prosecuting attorney they will be reminding voters that Barack Obama is a
[1:02:13.360 --> 1:02:18.960]  Christian who wants to cut taxes for anyone making less than $250,000 a
[1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:24.400]  year they also say they plan to respond immediately to any ads and statements
[1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:30.520]  that might violate Missouri ethics laws we want to keep this campaign focused on
[1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:34.240]  issues we don't want people to get distracted and the Missourians don't
[1:02:34.240 --> 1:02:38.080]  want to be distracted by these divisive character attacks so we're here to
[1:02:38.080 --> 1:02:42.600]  respond to any character attacks to set the record straight whether it is
[1:02:42.600 --> 1:02:47.040]  directly attributable to the campaign or to one of the soft money operations if
[1:02:47.040 --> 1:02:50.040]  they're not going to tell the truth and somebody's got to step up and say wait a
[1:02:50.040 --> 1:02:56.000]  minute that's not true this is the truth now the Obama campaign tells news for
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:00.520]  that others prosecutors and sheriffs are also part of the team including some
[1:03:00.520 --> 1:03:05.120]  from the Kansas City area and from rural parts of Missouri we're also told the
[1:03:05.120 --> 1:03:09.400]  truth squad is expected to include Jefferson County Sheriff Glenn Boyer
[1:03:09.400 --> 1:03:14.680]  live in Maplewood John Mills news for John and we have some truth squad clips
[1:03:14.680 --> 1:03:17.440]  we're gonna play later after Webster terribly joins us I know some stations
[1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:20.840]  don't care this first five minutes I'm gonna air that again in case you didn't
[1:03:20.840 --> 1:03:25.880]  think you were actually hearing that now listen the issue here is this is
[1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:32.880]  guilty until proven innocent it's not police and prosecutors job to say a
[1:03:32.880 --> 1:03:38.040]  news ad or a news site you know say if you're saying Obama's a communist that's
[1:03:38.040 --> 1:03:41.520]  your political speech that's your right he's a public figure well they actually
[1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:44.240]  went out and harassed people and threatened to arrest people who were
[1:03:44.240 --> 1:03:47.520]  saying things like that and whether it's true or not that's your right to do it
[1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:50.920]  of Obama wants to sue you civilly then it's an issue you know that's kind of
[1:03:50.920 --> 1:03:54.680]  like Rahm Emanuel the White House chief of staff saying if you're on the no
[1:03:54.680 --> 1:03:59.720]  fly list over a million Americans on it 25,000 added each month that if we think
[1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:03.080]  maybe you might be a terrorist and you're not a man you're not an American
[1:04:03.080 --> 1:04:08.840]  and you don't have a right to own a gun that's a quote so see it's they say on
[1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:13.840]  a secret blacklist that this is happening which you don't hear the left
[1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:18.960]  screaming about this I mean this makes McCarthy look tame no no no they love it
[1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:23.800]  and this is really going on and I've had Obama supporters people I've known for
[1:04:23.800 --> 1:04:27.560]  years call up and threaten me on air call up and say that Webster Tarpley is
[1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:32.760]  about to be on needs to be arrested and so I've experienced it firsthand this is
[1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:38.640]  really going on and now they want the fairness doctrine they want to shut down
[1:04:39.480 --> 1:04:45.720]  our internet freedom through internet to and so much more and we have to face the
[1:04:45.720 --> 1:04:50.240]  fact that this is actually happening instead of living in denial where we'll
[1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:55.960]  break it all down with Webster Tarpley the author of the Obama deception but the
[1:04:55.960 --> 1:04:59.720]  author of several books exposing the Obama deception Obama in the postmodern
[1:04:59.720 --> 1:05:05.480]  coup stay with us time is more precious than money you could be running out of
[1:05:05.480 --> 1:05:09.760]  time I want to share something with you about your body quote make no mistake

[1:08:13.880 --> 1:08:17.240]  we are now eight minutes 15 seconds into the second hour of worldwide
[1:08:17.240 --> 1:08:20.680]  transmission we have the man who was detained had his bumper sticker
[1:08:20.680 --> 1:08:24.440]  confiscated and that secret service go into his house to see if he was part of
[1:08:24.440 --> 1:08:27.640]  a hate group joining us coming up in the next hour that happened in
[1:08:27.640 --> 1:08:32.120]  oklahoma but i thought we should set the stage for that with an incredible
[1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:36.120]  researcher by the way and he the obama no it's like to call him a right-wing
[1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:41.080]  extremist because he criticizes obama i have to say he has been the most
[1:08:41.080 --> 1:08:45.720]  accurate he's had the greatest foresight i thought that webster tarpoli who'd
[1:08:45.720 --> 1:08:48.600]  never been over the top on other issues i thought it'd be accurate was over the
[1:08:48.600 --> 1:08:52.360]  top with what he was saying obama was going to do with truce squads and
[1:08:52.360 --> 1:08:56.280]  harassment and a private army and they were setting up a domestic army but not
[1:08:56.280 --> 1:08:59.240]  his own private army that's all now been announced
[1:08:59.240 --> 1:09:03.240]  and he is in our film with the obama deception in fact he's the central
[1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:08.360]  expert that we have gerald salante former governor jesse venterra
[1:09:08.360 --> 1:09:12.760]  and of course folks like george humphrey
[1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:17.240]  we have russell means krs one and others in the film
[1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:20.440]  barrage obama the unauthorized biography
[1:09:20.440 --> 1:09:23.640]  we carry this in info wars dot com in fact you can get it while you're
[1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:27.160]  ordering the obama deception my new film
[1:09:27.160 --> 1:09:30.680]  author of george w bush the unauthorized biography author of george
[1:09:30.680 --> 1:09:34.280]  h w bush the unauthorized biography and his first book on obama
[1:09:34.280 --> 1:09:39.560]  was the obama the postmodern coup webster griffin tarpoli both invaluable
[1:09:39.560 --> 1:09:43.640]  and rereading these books for the film for research purposes
[1:09:43.640 --> 1:09:47.160]  i have independently verified even in mainstream media everything
[1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:51.560]  tarpoli saying the the issue is tarpoli predicted this
[1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:56.680]  nine months before he was elected and so to talk about the attack on the first
[1:09:56.680 --> 1:09:58.840]  amendment the attack through the fairness doctrine
[1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:02.360]  they're openly announcing internet to shut down most of the old web and
[1:10:02.360 --> 1:10:05.160]  control free speech the new york times said quote
[1:10:05.160 --> 1:10:08.360]  you will give up your freedoms on the web and give up your free speech for
[1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:11.880]  safety it is all happening and then when we play
[1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:16.840]  news clips of police and prosecutors saying if we catch you lying about obama
[1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:22.040]  no judge no jury no civil trial you will be arrested
[1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:25.800]  people don't believe that then we play the clips on air from the news sources
[1:10:25.800 --> 1:10:29.720]  as they report it with a straight face and his governors come in and we've
[1:10:29.720 --> 1:10:33.160]  confirmed people who go up to an obama table and just say you know he's lying
[1:10:33.160 --> 1:10:35.960]  about everything and then they say police
[1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:42.040]  arrest him and they the police arrest you in many areas i mean this is
[1:10:42.040 --> 1:10:47.240]  even hard for me to believe well webster tarpoli you were right sir that's all i
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:50.760]  can say i salute your incredible research
[1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:55.240]  thank you so much alex how are you well i'm really getting concerned things are
[1:10:55.240 --> 1:10:58.760]  things are getting late we're you know i don't know about all these obama
[1:10:58.760 --> 1:11:02.200]  websites and forums whether there's people hoaxing on there whether it's
[1:11:02.200 --> 1:11:04.440]  you know whether they mean mean intentions or not but
[1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:08.200]  we are getting dirty tricks from the obama people that i'm not going to go
[1:11:08.200 --> 1:11:11.640]  into but the but the issue is you said this was going to happen
[1:11:11.640 --> 1:11:14.680]  you said under bush you get the fb i harassing you but there's not much they
[1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:17.000]  can do because they don't have public support
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:21.080]  but under a true fascist mass movement you get the
[1:11:21.080 --> 1:11:24.600]  the goon squads and now he's made good on his promise
[1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:28.360]  of a million man domestic security force with billions of dollars of federal
[1:11:28.360 --> 1:11:32.760]  funding billions they're running tv ads that masquerade is federal ads
[1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:36.840]  saying go to usa service dot org a private group
[1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:40.440]  already recruiting upwards of a half a million according to them in just the
[1:11:40.440 --> 1:11:43.880]  last month and a half to a new domestic army
[1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:47.160]  and let me just i know i have you as a guest but i'm just setting the table
[1:11:47.160 --> 1:11:49.640]  here and we'll hold you past the bottom of the hour if you can
[1:11:49.640 --> 1:11:51.640]  and because i want to spend more time with you
[1:11:51.640 --> 1:11:55.720]  erin dykes one of my chief editors here at info wars dot com
[1:11:55.720 --> 1:11:59.720]  on the films is uh getting back into the gym
[1:11:59.720 --> 1:12:05.000]  and friday night he was at a local gym lifting weights and people right next to
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:09.160]  him were talking bad about us saying i can't believe these anti-obama people
[1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:12.440]  claiming we're going into martial law look it hasn't happened
[1:12:12.440 --> 1:12:16.760]  they're a bunch of cooks they're dangerous so we're even hearing them
[1:12:16.760 --> 1:12:21.320]  talk about us at the gym okay webster break it down
[1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:24.600]  well i i think uh you're certainly correct that there's a there's a
[1:12:24.600 --> 1:12:28.600]  tremendous threat to the first amendment and i would say that if you look at
[1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:32.680]  people like uh nancy polosi and harry reid and
[1:12:32.680 --> 1:12:37.720]  schumer and uh somebody like uh senator stabinow of michigan who has been
[1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:41.560]  very vocal about this lately you're dealing with a mentality
[1:12:41.560 --> 1:12:45.240]  that um maybe not so common in american history but
[1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:49.880]  maybe it is but it's i would call it the totalitarian liberal mindset
[1:12:49.880 --> 1:12:52.920]  and the person that this is associated with perhaps the most is
[1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:58.520]  lord canes john maynard canes of the british who was a very bad economist and
[1:12:58.520 --> 1:13:02.280]  had nothing to do with the new deal had no influence in the united states in
[1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:06.040]  those years but uh preached and tried to make it look like he did
[1:13:06.040 --> 1:13:10.280]  but he was uh basically somebody who said that the uh banking system
[1:13:10.280 --> 1:13:14.280]  is primary and that you ought to then reorganize the society according to
[1:13:14.280 --> 1:13:19.560]  those needs but have a very oppressive kind of authoritarian to totalitarian
[1:13:19.560 --> 1:13:23.560]  form of government in order to preserve in his case that the city of london
[1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:27.880]  i think the uh the fairness doctrine is very much on the uh on the front burner
[1:13:27.880 --> 1:13:33.000]  and what they'd like to do is to muzzle voices of criticism
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:36.520]  and i think this is a direct collision with the first amendment i think it's
[1:13:36.520 --> 1:13:42.200]  an extremely clear cut case uh senator stabinow of michigan
[1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:45.560]  talked about this lately and of course she has this tremendous conflict of
[1:13:45.560 --> 1:13:49.000]  interest because her husband has been involved in the failed
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:53.240]  experiment of air america which was a perfectly legitimate thing to get a
[1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:56.520]  bunch of uh left liberals and and put them on
[1:13:56.520 --> 1:14:00.600]  the radio and and have that uh go out over the airwaves and the problem with
[1:14:00.600 --> 1:14:04.120]  it is it was not economically viable for whatever reason
[1:14:04.120 --> 1:14:08.440]  and there seems to be a mixture of totalitarian liberal
[1:14:08.440 --> 1:14:12.440]  desired a muzzle opposition along of course with the idea of getting
[1:14:12.440 --> 1:14:15.560]  government subsidies for activities that otherwise
[1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:18.680]  really don't don't make any sense well that's right bill press wrote for the
[1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:22.360]  washington post two weeks ago that he should be given a national show
[1:14:22.360 --> 1:14:26.440]  basically paid for by the government and then a bunch of talk show hosts
[1:14:26.440 --> 1:14:29.960]  should be shut down you know the first amendment regardless of what you think
[1:14:29.960 --> 1:14:33.080]  of a paper or a radio show or a filmmaker
[1:14:33.080 --> 1:14:36.440]  you know that's something that sacrosanct you keep your dirty paws
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:39.800]  off of it and they're openly in the news
[1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:43.640]  saying that they are going to go after it i listen
[1:14:43.640 --> 1:14:48.600]  uh these days to people like limbaugh and hannity and o'reilly and levin and
[1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:51.320]  savage and these these right wing characters because you've got to hear
[1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:55.560]  what they're saying um what they say about economics from my
[1:14:55.560 --> 1:14:59.240]  point of view is absolute lunacy in other words they're off the deep end
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:02.920]  they're raving at this the kind of stuff you might hear in an insane asylum
[1:15:02.920 --> 1:15:08.600]  but at the same time they represent a check and balance on the obama regime
[1:15:08.600 --> 1:15:11.560]  which i think you have to have in other words i would say that the following is
[1:15:11.560 --> 1:15:17.320]  a guideline the government should have no role and no opinion about the content
[1:15:17.320 --> 1:15:21.320]  of anything the content of any radio program until you get into
[1:15:21.320 --> 1:15:25.080]  something like uh... in a tremendous pornography or or something like this
[1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:29.880]  if you get on the radio and say go out and start shooting police that's fire in
[1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:33.880]  a theater a terroristic threat a call to terrorism then you're arrested
[1:15:33.880 --> 1:15:37.080]  it's a criminal issue there is nothing they can do
[1:15:37.080 --> 1:15:41.960]  through the law preemptively before you say it but but we see this mindset
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:44.760]  from the white house chief of staff want to play the clip later
[1:15:44.760 --> 1:15:48.440]  we played it a few weeks ago john pull it up uh where rama manual
[1:15:48.440 --> 1:15:52.920]  says no guns for those on no fly list and there's over a million people on
[1:15:52.920 --> 1:15:55.560]  this and they say they're going to expand it to tens of millions
[1:15:55.560 --> 1:15:58.920]  and then they just say you don't own guns kind of like
[1:15:58.920 --> 1:16:02.760]  the new bill they've introduced where the attorney general can ban any guns he
[1:16:02.760 --> 1:16:07.320]  wants uh... by simply signing an order again everything being transferred to
[1:16:07.320 --> 1:16:10.840]  dictatorial power yeah i think the the government should
[1:16:10.840 --> 1:16:14.120]  but out of anything that has to do with content apart from these
[1:16:14.120 --> 1:16:17.240]  these extreme limiting cases that we've just mentioned
[1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:20.440]  uh... they should have nothing to say about content there's no monitoring of
[1:16:20.440 --> 1:16:23.640]  content one of the ways they want to get around this is to say well
[1:16:23.640 --> 1:16:26.360]  we want to impose not really the fairness doctrine
[1:16:26.360 --> 1:16:31.800]  but some form of community control local control that's right seeking local
[1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:36.520]  obama noids on people who then tattle tail to the violent radicalization act
[1:16:36.520 --> 1:16:37.480]  board
[1:16:37.480 --> 1:16:40.600]  yeah now that's uh... that's very disturbing i mean that the community
[1:16:40.600 --> 1:16:42.280]  control has been
[1:16:42.280 --> 1:16:46.760]  in some ways the american face of proto fascism going back to the
[1:16:46.760 --> 1:16:50.600]  ford foundation in the late nineteen sixties in their community control
[1:16:50.600 --> 1:16:55.160]  experiment that's what obama in chicago is is they have these controlled mobs
[1:16:55.160 --> 1:16:58.520]  exactly and and and the model of course with the new york city teacher strike
[1:16:58.520 --> 1:17:02.040]  with the ford foundation created a predominantly black community control
[1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:05.080]  apparatus and played that against the white jewish
[1:17:05.080 --> 1:17:08.600]  teachers union to bust the union and and destroy education
[1:17:08.600 --> 1:17:11.400]  in the city which is still with where they are now
[1:17:11.400 --> 1:17:15.160]  uh... that obviously is is the mentality that you can organize a kind of
[1:17:15.160 --> 1:17:19.800]  fascist or a local control apparatus with people from a corn who are getting
[1:17:19.800 --> 1:17:23.720]  subsidized and and things like this and then use that to bludgeon
[1:17:23.720 --> 1:17:27.560]  uh... these voices of of criticism so i don't know why they've now announced
[1:17:27.560 --> 1:17:30.760]  four and a half billion dollars for a corn
[1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:33.400]  uh... and uh... move on in others
[1:17:33.400 --> 1:17:36.680]  yeah which is uh... something that you uh... you don't want to pay so i would
[1:17:36.680 --> 1:17:39.480]  say that that should that that should obviously be fought
[1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:42.920]  the one thing you could do with that with media is it to the extent that you
[1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:48.280]  have monopoly concentrations of ownership if some company owns all the tv all
[1:17:48.280 --> 1:17:51.160]  the radio and all the newspapers and everything else in some
[1:17:51.160 --> 1:17:54.120]  city that's probably not a good thing so you could think well
[1:17:54.120 --> 1:17:57.560]  the ownership should not be concentrated but in terms of the content
[1:17:57.560 --> 1:17:59.960]  the government should have absolutely no voice
[1:17:59.960 --> 1:18:03.400]  and should not be aware of it so i think that's uh... that's a very dangerous
[1:18:03.400 --> 1:18:04.760]  thing but let me just uh...
[1:18:04.760 --> 1:18:08.920]  shift for a second right now uh... what's happening at the obama white house
[1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:13.480]  is this austerity summit the sacrifice summit what he called the
[1:18:13.480 --> 1:18:16.200]  fiscal responsibility summit and this is a
[1:18:16.200 --> 1:18:21.160]  130 vultures and and deficit hawks and austerity freaks
[1:18:21.160 --> 1:18:24.120]  are coming together and they are planning ways
[1:18:24.120 --> 1:18:29.400]  to loot social security and medicare in the coming years to gouge and rob and

[1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:10.680]  great but I want it specifically about the whole
[1:24:10.680 --> 1:24:15.880]  Obama agenda and that's quite a wide field but the
[1:24:15.880 --> 1:24:20.520]  questions for Webster Tarbley 1-800-259-9231
[1:24:20.520 --> 1:24:24.680]  800-259-9231 Webster
[1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:27.960]  now that several newspaper reporters called me this morning dealing with
[1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:31.400]  how we exposed the military gun confiscation drills
[1:24:31.400 --> 1:24:34.680]  that are going on across the country but specifically partially got them to
[1:24:34.680 --> 1:24:39.720]  scale back they claim one in Iowa in Arcadia
[1:24:39.720 --> 1:24:42.600]  and we just he's coming on at the end of the show
[1:24:42.600 --> 1:24:46.280]  he wants to quote me I mean so we'll just do the interview
[1:24:46.280 --> 1:24:50.680]  vice versa on air kill two birds with one stone but he brought up to me
[1:24:50.680 --> 1:24:55.080]  we just talked to him during two breaks in an article this is breaking
[1:24:55.080 --> 1:25:01.320]  this is not in the news yet that the Iowa state pension funds
[1:25:01.320 --> 1:25:04.200]  are being frozen and this is starting to happen all
[1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:07.080]  across the country so I want to get Webster to talk about
[1:25:07.080 --> 1:25:11.000]  what's happening with that as well but Webster
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:18.760]  how would you say Obama's first 35 days or 33 days
[1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:22.440]  have gone I think people are doing a pretty good job I mean he's moving
[1:25:22.440 --> 1:25:24.920]  forward horribly getting a lot of bad things passed but
[1:25:24.920 --> 1:25:28.440]  it we already see his approval rating dropping by as much as 10 points
[1:25:28.440 --> 1:25:32.760]  and a lot of the luster is beginning to wear off well I think the there has been
[1:25:32.760 --> 1:25:35.880]  some resistance the central issue is you have this
[1:25:35.880 --> 1:25:41.480]  1.5 quadrillion derivatives bubble in the center of the room and that is what
[1:25:41.480 --> 1:25:45.880]  Paulson and Bush ran up against with the original tarp
[1:25:45.880 --> 1:25:50.040]  and now this debacle by Geithner right the Geithner press conference that
[1:25:50.040 --> 1:25:52.920]  never was the the press conference where Geithner
[1:25:52.920 --> 1:25:57.080]  announced he was going to his plan for the bad bank and saving
[1:25:57.080 --> 1:26:00.200]  the banking system two weeks ago tomorrow
[1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:03.640]  Geithner was supposed to deliver this and of course he didn't have anything to
[1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:07.640]  say in detail and the markets crashed and the banking panic then began and
[1:26:07.640 --> 1:26:11.000]  right now we're in the middle of what amounts to a banking panic
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:15.720]  the the city bank is going bankrupt for the third time it was bankrupt in
[1:26:15.720 --> 1:26:19.000]  October for the first round of the tarp got 25 billion
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:23.080]  city bank was then bankrupt again by the end of November got another 25 billion
[1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:27.000]  and now city bank is going to be the recipient of I don't know how many
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:30.040]  hundreds of billions but they're going to be nationalized
[1:26:30.040 --> 1:26:33.800]  in part that the thing that guys that the Paulson and Geithner both run up
[1:26:33.800 --> 1:26:36.920]  against is there is no solution to derivatives
[1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:40.200]  the only thing to do with derivatives is to wipe them out
[1:26:40.200 --> 1:26:45.160]  to expunge them to delete them to shred them to make them into wallpaper
[1:26:45.160 --> 1:26:48.920]  to use them for kitty litter you know but the globalists can't do that because
[1:26:48.920 --> 1:26:52.840]  they built their empire through these fraudulent
[1:26:52.840 --> 1:26:59.240]  financial devices and so they are going to feed the entire world into this black hole
[1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:03.240]  yes exactly right and that the problem this is the the the structural problem
[1:27:03.240 --> 1:27:07.560]  of the obama administration is that they are puppets of precisely these people
[1:27:07.560 --> 1:27:11.720]  you look at the personnel in the obama administration you've got geithner
[1:27:11.720 --> 1:27:15.640]  he of course is Kissinger associates international monetary fund new york
[1:27:15.640 --> 1:27:19.480]  federal reserve but he's got uh summers behind him from the
[1:27:19.480 --> 1:27:23.000]  imf and the clinton administration essentially another creature
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:26.920]  of finance capital and you've got paul they don't balker the trilateral
[1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:31.960]  commission the carter administration the uh the treasury and the federal reserve
[1:27:31.960 --> 1:27:36.440]  uh and therefore all of the policymakers around obama including obama's own
[1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:41.560]  foundation funded mentality is that derivatives have to be sacrosanct so
[1:27:41.560 --> 1:27:45.560]  we're we're headed for a really big blow up about this i just urge people to
[1:27:45.560 --> 1:27:48.920]  talk about derivatives if you listen to these people like limbaugh and
[1:27:48.920 --> 1:27:52.520]  hannity the word derivative has never been mentioned
[1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:56.120]  they don't ever refer to it the american people need to know
[1:27:56.120 --> 1:28:00.040]  that the cause of the depression is derivatives as soon as you say derivatives
[1:28:00.040 --> 1:28:03.000]  cause the depression then also you know who's guilty
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:06.440]  i agree i agree i agree if we do not point out
[1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:09.640]  that the bankers engineered this at the bankers are running all of this at the
[1:28:09.640 --> 1:28:13.080]  bankers are imploding the world economy to consolidate it that's in their own
[1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:16.600]  imf world bank documents you can argue it's gotten out of control even their
[1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:20.600]  control and that's even more frightening uh... then we can set about
[1:28:20.600 --> 1:28:23.800]  rectifying things but as long as the control corporate press
[1:28:23.800 --> 1:28:27.640]  on both the left and the right keep advertising uh... the fact that home
[1:28:27.640 --> 1:28:31.000]  owners did it or subprime mortgages did it
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:34.120]  uh... or or that the commie obama is going to get us
[1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:37.480]  it's not a commie obama that's his foundation left cover can you speak to
[1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:40.840]  that absolutely the the difference of course is that bush
[1:28:40.840 --> 1:28:44.760]  bush was an open reactionary right he was a fog he was a brute
[1:28:44.760 --> 1:28:47.720]  and he would come out there and say things like bring it on and wanted
[1:28:47.720 --> 1:28:49.160]  dead or alive
[1:28:49.160 --> 1:28:53.240]  and so forth uh... and he was gonna obviously privatize social security
[1:28:53.240 --> 1:28:55.960]  and wreck it that way and uses political capital so
[1:28:55.960 --> 1:29:00.440]  with bush there is a certain uh... funny truth to the fact that he said you may
[1:29:00.440 --> 1:29:03.960]  hate me but you know where i stand in some ways it's true we did hate him
[1:29:03.960 --> 1:29:07.880]  and we knew what he stood for obama is different obama is slippery
[1:29:07.880 --> 1:29:12.360]  shifty slimy he's evasive he deals in deception
[1:29:12.360 --> 1:29:17.000]  dissembling he dopes people and what he's doing right now is a is a funny
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:19.400]  exercise he has a couple of little things
[1:29:19.400 --> 1:29:22.360]  that he puts up front as window dressing that are good
[1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:26.280]  if you look at this uh... this uh... stimulus right he's got uh...
[1:29:26.280 --> 1:29:29.880]  forty billion dollars for unemployment but yeah given the dog bones stay there
[1:29:29.880 --> 1:29:33.480]  we'll break down uh... the seven hundred eighty seven million dollar

[1:33:58.600 --> 1:34:05.800]  move through this um obama has been caught in just endless lies and i go
[1:34:05.800 --> 1:34:08.600]  out on the street and talk to obama supporters here in austin they have his
[1:34:08.600 --> 1:34:12.520]  picture up in many restaurants and businesses like i'm in
[1:34:12.520 --> 1:34:16.760]  malice china they they become angry you say look i'm not a
[1:34:16.760 --> 1:34:20.840]  bush supporter i'm a i'm a constitutional you know libertarian
[1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:24.920]  uh it's the same agenda he's said 23 months now in iraq increasing troops
[1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:29.560]  in afghanistan lying about lobbyist uh first he announced they're going to
[1:34:29.560 --> 1:34:32.600]  continue rendition and secret arrest they might shut one of their
[1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:36.520]  hundred plus camps guantanamo ap reported this weekend that they're
[1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:40.120]  seeing no juneva convention no bill of rights no nothing for
[1:34:40.120 --> 1:34:43.720]  detainees even when the supreme court ruled last year that bush couldn't do
[1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:47.320]  that obama's continuing that and the obama people suddenly just i see their
[1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:50.440]  sights they go it's okay he's keeping us safe so
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:54.520]  it was fun to criticize bush for all of that but it was just about feeling good
[1:34:54.520 --> 1:34:57.720]  because they were the liberals now that they're in control
[1:34:57.720 --> 1:35:02.040]  they like the evil don't they well there's a certainly a hysteria
[1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:06.760]  among left liberals which uh point to the fact that this group has been
[1:35:06.760 --> 1:35:11.080]  i guess notable for its fecklessness and it's it's a gullibility
[1:35:11.080 --> 1:35:14.520]  uh these are people who really want to be duped it's not just that they can be
[1:35:14.520 --> 1:35:18.120]  duped they have an active desire uh to be duped and you've you've
[1:35:18.120 --> 1:35:21.160]  mentioned i think in foreign policy you've mentioned a lot of the things
[1:35:21.160 --> 1:35:25.160]  if we look at the economics though which i think it is pretty much center stage
[1:35:25.160 --> 1:35:28.280]  the the overall view i think you'd have to go through seven or eight irons we
[1:35:28.280 --> 1:35:31.560]  can't really do it in in any detail but the activities of the federal
[1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:35.480]  reserve supported by obama right the term auction facility primary dealer
[1:35:35.480 --> 1:35:39.320]  lending facility aig money market mutual funds and you
[1:35:39.320 --> 1:35:43.000]  came up with a figure of eight to nine trillion dollars of a lot of its lending
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:45.560]  but a lot of its lending that won't be paid back
[1:35:45.560 --> 1:35:49.320]  so that's a hundred percent for banks insurance companies credit card companies
[1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:52.120]  all paper then we have the tarp the seven hundred
[1:35:52.120 --> 1:35:55.880]  billion uh the uh the bailout uh seven hundred billion
[1:35:55.880 --> 1:36:00.040]  basically only for banks then you've got the foreclosure plan
[1:36:00.040 --> 1:36:02.920]  which is between fifty and two hundred and fifty billion
[1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:07.640]  and that's incentives to lenders it's incentives to predatory lenders like
[1:36:07.640 --> 1:36:10.920]  angelo mozillo of countrywide people who have sold
[1:36:10.920 --> 1:36:13.560]  adjustable rate mortgages that should never have been
[1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:18.520]  legal and now either on a voluntary or compulsory basis if they take tarp money
[1:36:18.520 --> 1:36:21.960]  they've got to they've got to let people stay in their home so so far it's all
[1:36:21.960 --> 1:36:25.640]  in favor of the bankers now we just had obama give his speech he gave his
[1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:28.760]  introductory remarks at the white house now in the break
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:33.240]  in this austerity and uh fiscal responsibility summit this gathering of
[1:36:33.240 --> 1:36:36.440]  the deficit hawks and the in the austerity vultures
[1:36:36.440 --> 1:36:41.080]  and hyenas and he said he wants he wants to start gouging medicare social
[1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:45.240]  security and medicaid uh and he wants to start cutting
[1:36:45.240 --> 1:36:48.840]  payments to agriculture now agribusiness of course is not popular
[1:36:48.840 --> 1:36:53.240]  but on the other hand you do have to eat so if that's the way you're producing
[1:36:53.240 --> 1:36:57.160]  food at any given time i would not go in there and start wielding
[1:36:57.160 --> 1:37:00.600]  the budget act so let's be specific you got over 12
[1:37:00.600 --> 1:37:03.960]  you've got over 12 trillion of the bankers to do whatever they want most
[1:37:03.960 --> 1:37:06.840]  of it going offshore into bonuses and things
[1:37:06.840 --> 1:37:10.520]  and then meanwhile out of a 787 million dollar stimulus
[1:37:10.520 --> 1:37:13.720]  what a third of it might actually go to the economy
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:16.840]  yeah i i think that's about right i mean the things that are good in there
[1:37:16.840 --> 1:37:21.080]  again i think uh 40 billion for unemployment benefits 18 billion for
[1:37:21.080 --> 1:37:24.760]  child support that's good in my book food stamps we got one
[1:37:24.760 --> 1:37:28.600]  one in ten americans is now living on food stamps a 20 billion
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:33.240]  seems like very little to spend 27 and a half billion on highway construction
[1:37:33.240 --> 1:37:36.680]  that's great uh 21 billion for other transportation
[1:37:36.680 --> 1:37:39.880]  um for it uh temporary increase in federal medical
[1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:44.040]  assistance 90 billion that's fine but two billion
[1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:48.280]  for this dashel plan the national coordinator for health information
[1:37:48.280 --> 1:37:52.280]  technology take that out of there right where it said that was nine
[1:37:52.280 --> 1:37:56.440]  19 billion the federalization of that database and the moment i'm just i'm
[1:37:56.440 --> 1:37:59.800]  going by what i have here in this uh in this local uh
[1:37:59.800 --> 1:38:04.280]  newspaper of mine here the washington post but here look basic science research
[1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:08.360]  three billion that's crazy that should be 30 billion that should be 60 billion
[1:38:08.360 --> 1:38:11.720]  yeah look at look what science research just from nasa alone did with the
[1:38:11.720 --> 1:38:16.120]  internet computers our entire system is based on this if we wouldn't have had
[1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:19.480]  those innovations we'd have nothing absolutely and right now the
[1:38:19.480 --> 1:38:24.120]  nasa has this that the next generation of mars lander right the mars science
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:28.520]  laboratory 2.2 billion and the deficit hawks and the deficit
[1:38:28.520 --> 1:38:32.440]  vultures are saying no 2.2 billion is too much we should put that into
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:34.440]  subsidies for acorn or something like this
[1:38:34.440 --> 1:38:38.280]  meanwhile we have a trillion 100 million dollar defense budget
[1:38:38.280 --> 1:38:42.680]  ballooning under obama yeah i look i would say if you go through this if you
[1:38:42.680 --> 1:38:45.480]  add in the budget and then the grand bargain the thing that they're working
[1:38:45.480 --> 1:38:48.680]  on today is the so-called grand bargain or austerity summit
[1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:52.040]  uh the guy here is peter or shag the director of
[1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:55.480]  management and budget that guy is the dangerous austerity
[1:38:55.480 --> 1:38:59.000]  genocidal dean counter if you add this all up
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:02.760]  what is it a hundred to one the banks over the people
[1:39:02.760 --> 1:39:06.840]  maybe it's only 50 to one but it's maybe it's more than a hundred to one
[1:39:06.840 --> 1:39:09.960]  somebody ought to do the math but if you go through this and say
[1:39:09.960 --> 1:39:14.040]  for every dollar that a banker gets does the does the america the american
[1:39:14.040 --> 1:39:17.800]  people even get a penny out of this let me just focus on social well hold on
[1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:24.120]  take the tax cut they admit it's 15 and a half dollars every two weeks
[1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:27.160]  so i guess every two weeks you can buy a pizza
[1:39:27.160 --> 1:39:32.120]  yeah it's it's uh that's obviously trivial and and i'm in favor obviously of
[1:39:32.120 --> 1:39:36.200]  uh we can call it a federal emergency relief in other words if you give people
[1:39:36.200 --> 1:39:39.880]  tax relief right now it's a form of emergency relief well my whole issue is
[1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:42.760]  i'm against socialism because it creates dependency
[1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:45.640]  and elites can come in and suck it out of the trough and we disagree on some of
[1:39:45.640 --> 1:39:49.000]  those economic subtleties but overall if you're
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:52.120]  going to have socialism as again bloomberg reported
[1:39:52.120 --> 1:39:56.760]  9.7 trillion to the banks that would pay off 90 plus percent
[1:39:56.760 --> 1:40:01.080]  of all mortgages i mean why not just if we're going to do it give it directly
[1:40:01.080 --> 1:40:03.720]  to the people that would energize the economy
[1:40:03.720 --> 1:40:07.960]  yeah let me just point out that socialism would mean government ownership of the
[1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:11.880]  means of production and so far this has not been done
[1:40:11.880 --> 1:40:16.760]  Detroit in my view ought to be nationalized Chrysler Ford and GM
[1:40:16.760 --> 1:40:20.600]  should be nationalized and run by the government you know that's another
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:24.520]  subtly that's socialism that would seem to be a state
[1:40:24.520 --> 1:40:27.400]  sector but webster that's another subtlety you're right
[1:40:27.400 --> 1:40:31.560]  this is not even nationalization we need to see nationalization of the federal
[1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:35.400]  reserve this is the treasury under the bank or bailout bill
[1:40:35.400 --> 1:40:39.080]  being given omnipotent power with the federal reserve and so you have these
[1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:44.280]  offshore banks in a full wall street coup taking over some of their
[1:40:44.280 --> 1:40:47.640]  competition right now and propping up their system
[1:40:47.640 --> 1:40:53.160]  so this isn't nationalization this is global privatization or hijacking
[1:40:53.160 --> 1:40:57.240]  it's privatizing the profits and socializing the losses
[1:40:57.240 --> 1:41:00.600]  socialism would mean ownership of means of production and the problem with that
[1:41:00.600 --> 1:41:04.280]  in the united states is we have almost no means of production
[1:41:04.280 --> 1:41:07.880]  if those Detroit factories and a few farms and a couple of other things
[1:41:07.880 --> 1:41:11.240]  we've got something left but generally speaking since valker was in there at
[1:41:11.240 --> 1:41:14.280]  the federal reserve means of production have pretty much been
[1:41:14.280 --> 1:41:17.080]  systematically destroyed including you know the famous
[1:41:17.080 --> 1:41:21.160]  episodes of dynamiting steel plants in the early 80s globalism the globalist
[1:41:21.160 --> 1:41:23.640]  wanted us dependent okay listen i want to go to calls webster
[1:41:23.640 --> 1:41:26.520]  and i want to cover a host of other issues i'll be back up this week for a
[1:41:26.520 --> 1:41:29.560]  couple hours if you can do it because i know you've got a lot of knowledge on
[1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:33.240]  his entire agenda what about the police state grid
[1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:36.120]  i mean you were right i mean they announced they would do it but to
[1:41:36.120 --> 1:41:40.520]  actually see it happen is hard to believe tv ads billboards everywhere
[1:41:40.520 --> 1:41:45.000]  saying join usaservice.org and it when you look at it up in its
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:49.960]  registration it is a private 501c3 of the democratic party
[1:41:49.960 --> 1:41:53.480]  and obama masquerading with the federal seal
[1:41:53.480 --> 1:41:58.280]  and the federal eagle saying join help america and they advertise in the soup
[1:41:58.280 --> 1:42:03.320]  kitchens but when you read it is in a new domestic
[1:42:03.320 --> 1:42:07.560]  political army separate from the new million person
[1:42:07.560 --> 1:42:12.040]  quote civilian army under the pentagon with the new pentagon directive
[1:42:12.040 --> 1:42:17.560]  that has now been issued so so this is this is materializing in a big way
[1:42:17.560 --> 1:42:21.480]  yeah it's uh... it's the the musolini model right the first thing that musolini
[1:42:21.480 --> 1:42:25.400]  did after the march on roman in 1922 was to create
[1:42:25.400 --> 1:42:30.200]  the voluntary national security militia and that's i guess what we're getting
[1:42:30.200 --> 1:42:34.120]  now if you look in the stimulus uh... the thousand
[1:42:34.120 --> 1:42:38.600]  plus pages you're gonna find things that that i haven't had time to go into but
[1:42:38.600 --> 1:42:42.920]  they're very very suspicious uh... things like
[1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:47.000]  several billion dollars for housing assistance
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:50.760]  uh... and you wonder what what does that mean housing assistance that probably
[1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:54.760]  means acorn here 13 billion dollars for housing assistance
[1:42:54.760 --> 1:42:59.640]  programs and that i think is probably a conduit for money going into acorn and
[1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:01.720]  then into these
[1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:05.480]  organizations well let's go there's no think about it a p reported
[1:43:05.480 --> 1:43:10.760]  4.4 4.5 we covered it last week that is going to acorn
[1:43:10.760 --> 1:43:14.200]  yeah for acorn but then the idea that that is then going to fund these
[1:43:14.200 --> 1:43:17.880]  uh... neighborhood organizations in other words the vote on another no no no no
[1:43:17.880 --> 1:43:20.440]  no no they announced that a big prayer dinner
[1:43:20.440 --> 1:43:23.080]  they said they're gonna have all the preachers and local communities under
[1:43:23.080 --> 1:43:27.400]  obama with federal money that you know you're right no no no that's on record
[1:43:27.400 --> 1:43:30.600]  yeah so i think that those are the things that obviously ought to be cut out
[1:43:30.600 --> 1:43:33.880]  now the problem of course with this stuff is the congress has fallen down
[1:43:33.880 --> 1:43:37.080]  there were no hearings on any of these bills right all of the stuff that we're
[1:43:37.080 --> 1:43:40.040]  talking about the top of the stimulus and everything else
[1:43:40.040 --> 1:43:43.880]  but the entire hearings process in the congress is broken down i know this i
[1:43:43.880 --> 1:43:47.640]  used to be a big performer here at the house appropriations
[1:43:47.640 --> 1:43:50.520]  subcommittees like you could go in there and and testify right it was
[1:43:50.520 --> 1:43:53.240]  something in even just a an individual could do
[1:43:53.240 --> 1:43:56.120]  and you could get in the public record with the statement that is sometimes
[1:43:56.120 --> 1:44:00.040]  then picked up by by local or regional press or people who are interested in
[1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:01.640]  an issue there's none of that
[1:44:01.640 --> 1:44:05.640]  in other words the congress has become a rubber stamp well that's another lie
[1:44:05.640 --> 1:44:08.440]  obama said he would always make sure five days read a bill
[1:44:08.440 --> 1:44:13.000]  then he made sure as a senator uh... that the bailout didn't work
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:16.520]  and that nobody could read it and then they were given less than a few hours
[1:44:16.520 --> 1:44:17.400]  uh...
[1:44:17.400 --> 1:44:22.760]  last week to read the quote stimulus plan it was just and it was one thousand
[1:44:22.760 --> 1:44:27.000]  seventy five pages long did it the washington post of yesterday says
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:29.880]  obama wants to cut the deficit in half
[1:44:29.880 --> 1:44:32.920]  despite the spending on the stimulus so how do you do that
[1:44:32.920 --> 1:44:37.400]  it then an anonymous government official tells the washington post we've got to
[1:44:37.400 --> 1:44:42.040]  get our deficits under control we need to address the nation's chronic
[1:44:42.040 --> 1:44:47.720]  imbalance in the budget by squeezing savings from the federal programs
[1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:50.920]  health programs for the elderly and the poor
[1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:54.200]  and that's what dashel says and it's in the bill
[1:44:54.200 --> 1:44:57.160]  to not literally not give health care to the old folks
[1:44:57.160 --> 1:45:01.160]  we're not scaring you here with us this is what it says
[1:45:01.160 --> 1:45:04.600]  yeah i i would say obama is and above all uh... dashel
[1:45:04.600 --> 1:45:08.680]  and and i think obviously dashel is still on the scene in other words dashel
[1:45:08.680 --> 1:45:11.080]  didn't just you know go back to south dakota
[1:45:11.080 --> 1:45:14.760]  he's still a very active lobbyist he's still writing these bills he's still
[1:45:14.760 --> 1:45:17.400]  extremely influential i wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't have some kind
[1:45:17.400 --> 1:45:18.920]  of a secret office in the
[1:45:18.920 --> 1:45:21.960]  in the old executive office building or something like this
[1:45:21.960 --> 1:45:25.000]  what they're interested in doing is is gouging that money
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:28.040]  it's the philosophy of uh... governor lamb
[1:45:28.040 --> 1:45:30.920]  of colorado if you remember him he said basically
[1:45:30.920 --> 1:45:35.080]  old people should die well why should you die it's obviously for the bottom
[1:45:35.080 --> 1:45:38.920]  line of agey metropolitan life insurance company
[1:45:38.920 --> 1:45:43.800]  and uh... and the uh... and the the federal bond hole right dashel dashel
[1:45:43.800 --> 1:45:47.080]  said that in the book that's in the bill i mean this
[1:45:47.080 --> 1:45:51.160]  he said you will not be given a surgery if you're going blind you're supposed
[1:45:51.160 --> 1:45:52.920]  to go blind
[1:45:52.920 --> 1:45:53.560]  yeah
[1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:57.240]  so uh... well at that point what's there to say that's nuremberg
[1:45:57.240 --> 1:46:00.520]  in other words if you take any population for any reason
[1:46:00.520 --> 1:46:03.800]  and deliberately deny them food clothing shelter
[1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:07.880]  inadequate medical care that's a high crime against humanity under the terms
[1:46:07.880 --> 1:46:11.640]  of the nuremberg president and uh... that's a very serious offense it's
[1:46:11.640 --> 1:46:14.840]  actually a capital offense though uh... i think that uh...
[1:46:14.840 --> 1:46:17.640]  we're now in a extremely dangerous terrain
[1:46:17.640 --> 1:46:21.320]  and the only thing to do now is is to mobilize i would suggest the following
[1:46:21.320 --> 1:46:24.280]  if you have elderly relatives you should take a look at them
[1:46:24.280 --> 1:46:28.920]  if they thought they had a 401k or an ira they don't anymore that's all gone
[1:46:28.920 --> 1:46:32.680]  the market is crashing again today no way to go but down down down
[1:46:32.680 --> 1:46:36.680]  so the whole idea of a of a privately managed uh...
[1:46:36.680 --> 1:46:40.200]  retirement program is out the window then you turn around and say well we have
[1:46:40.200 --> 1:46:43.480]  private health insurance yeah a i g is gone
[1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:48.040]  and uh... other ones met life parkford connecticut general whatever you call
[1:46:48.040 --> 1:46:48.760]  them
[1:46:48.760 --> 1:46:52.360]  they're all right behind so the only possible approach in this
[1:46:52.360 --> 1:46:56.040]  in this situation i would say is probably to double the average social
[1:46:56.040 --> 1:46:59.640]  security pension so that you could actually live on it which right now
[1:46:59.640 --> 1:47:05.000]  is hard to do and people up medicare not cut it not gouge it not looted
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:08.680]  and again i don't want to hear uh... i mean republicans call
[1:47:08.680 --> 1:47:12.440]  and say you're a bunch of commies hey the bankers have already stolen
[1:47:12.440 --> 1:47:16.200]  everything all were all partly saying is they destroyed everything
[1:47:16.200 --> 1:47:20.440]  and what we can do a little people die i mean on the side of the street i mean
[1:47:20.440 --> 1:47:23.960]  it's insane everything is turned on its head
[1:47:23.960 --> 1:47:28.040]  we have to get the i would say beyond ideology is human life in other words
[1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:31.240]  should all people die is that the kind of civilization you want that's
[1:47:31.240 --> 1:47:35.160]  that means the end of civilization if you have if you have youth in asia for
[1:47:35.160 --> 1:47:37.400]  old people as a matter of government policy
[1:47:37.400 --> 1:47:41.000]  you're in some kind of totalitarian brave new world
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:44.440]  uh... or well though our chamber
[1:47:44.440 --> 1:47:47.720]  all right well what we got to go to call some of you back up this week is this
[1:47:47.720 --> 1:47:51.400]  is so important uh... but let's go to calls greg and california you're on the
[1:47:51.400 --> 1:47:52.840]  year go ahead
[1:47:52.840 --> 1:47:56.680]  hey what's up alex uh... i just got a quick question that people don't usually
[1:47:56.680 --> 1:48:00.200]  ask uh... i was wondering if you guys know about the fact that obama is
[1:48:00.200 --> 1:48:04.520]  related to cheney and bush by blood yeah that's people magazine and time
[1:48:04.520 --> 1:48:10.280]  magazine he's related on four sides to cheney and two sides to bush
[1:48:10.280 --> 1:48:14.600]  in like brad pit and like uh... hillary clinton's related to angeline joe lee
[1:48:14.600 --> 1:48:16.840]  and all these other like celebrities and all that
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:20.840]  well every time i explained uh... related on four sides
[1:48:20.840 --> 1:48:26.920]  uh... bush was related to carry on thirteen sides people how does that
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:31.000]  work that means great-grandpaul's great-grandmaul's i mean they're related
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:34.040]  not just once or twice is still third cousins or something
[1:48:34.040 --> 1:48:38.440]  they're related everywhere it's like a pedigree uh... webster
[1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:41.240]  well i think that the interesting thing about the bush family i think is the
[1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:45.160]  is the uh... that the dukes of devonshire and the dukes of pembroke and
[1:48:45.160 --> 1:48:50.040]  the uh... the cavendish family lord herbert of chirbury with a guy running
[1:48:50.040 --> 1:48:52.440]  around in the early sixteen hundred and that
[1:48:52.440 --> 1:48:55.400]  is an ancestor of the bushes and uh...
[1:48:55.400 --> 1:48:59.320]  george herbert the so-called uh... well poet uh... cavalier
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:02.920]  learest of the of the uh... early sixteen hundred also
[1:49:02.920 --> 1:49:07.640]  so the bushes uh... are through the walkers in particular but also on the
[1:49:07.640 --> 1:49:10.680]  herbert they are a british oligarchical
[1:49:10.680 --> 1:49:16.200]  family and that i think can be traced back fairly fairly well
[1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:19.800]  absolutely anything else craig now it's a thank you
[1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:23.880]  thank you sir brian in iowa brian you're on the air

[1:54:17.720 --> 1:54:20.600]  pentagon openly announcing they're gonna use regular army against the american
[1:54:20.600 --> 1:54:23.960]  people doing urban warfare drills to condition
[1:54:23.960 --> 1:54:28.200]  the public how does this tie in well that the uh...
[1:54:28.200 --> 1:54:32.040]  the the dynamic of fascism as we see it in in musolini is to
[1:54:32.040 --> 1:54:36.040]  aim at institutional changes one institutional change would be to wipe
[1:54:36.040 --> 1:54:41.160]  out this whole area of uh... what can we call it opposition talk radio of any
[1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:45.080]  kind right be it reactionary or uh... or or any other kind right
[1:54:45.080 --> 1:54:48.040]  um... which is uh... that would be an institutional change you would have
[1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:52.280]  changed the the institutional array of of u.s. society
[1:54:52.280 --> 1:54:54.840]  that would be one side the other side is uh...
[1:54:54.840 --> 1:54:58.840]  these militias right that you use as a kind of extralegal
[1:54:58.840 --> 1:55:03.240]  battering ram to to beat up your opposition and and and wiped them out
[1:55:03.240 --> 1:55:07.400]  same same idea and no one's allowed to have a militia but the obaminoids
[1:55:07.400 --> 1:55:11.160]  i think of course and the uh... the other side of the course is this
[1:55:11.160 --> 1:55:15.320]  notion of the the state-sponsored compulsory cartel
[1:55:15.320 --> 1:55:18.840]  in economics right we're getting close to that in the banking world but they've
[1:55:18.840 --> 1:55:22.680]  obviously picked jp morgan chase as the survivor
[1:55:22.680 --> 1:55:25.480]  and they're going to feed the other ones into that they've fed washington
[1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:27.000]  mutual into it
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:32.360]  and so forth so joseph as obama stalls as obama jenna stalls
[1:55:32.360 --> 1:55:34.880]  do you see stage terror in the cards
[1:55:34.880 --> 1:55:39.720]  uh... the door to fall flag terrorism is undoubtedly wide open and if we take a
[1:55:39.720 --> 1:55:43.960]  joe biden's uh... seattle speech of october nineteen seriously as i believe
[1:55:43.960 --> 1:55:44.840]  we must
[1:55:44.840 --> 1:55:47.880]  i remember he said six months first six months you're gonna have a
[1:55:47.880 --> 1:55:48.800]  staged
[1:55:48.800 --> 1:55:52.880]  uh... generated international crisis in which the righteousness of the u.s.
[1:55:52.880 --> 1:55:54.720]  position will not be
[1:55:54.720 --> 1:55:58.040]  immediately evident and the from the ruling class for review as long as they
[1:55:58.040 --> 1:55:59.160]  had bush
[1:55:59.160 --> 1:56:03.120]  they had that they had a basket case the closet case that they couldn't send out
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:06.440]  in in the face of world public opinion to accuse somebody
[1:56:06.440 --> 1:56:09.520]  of having blown up an american city or something like that
[1:56:09.520 --> 1:56:13.280]  but now they think that they have a spokesman who's got the charisma and the
[1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:17.600]  magnetism to be believed i don't believe i i don't share that i don't think
[1:56:17.600 --> 1:56:21.520]  the world would believe obama i think they'd say this is just another liar
[1:56:21.520 --> 1:56:24.600]  but this time operating on the left cover rather than this this right wing
[1:56:24.600 --> 1:56:26.000]  ideology
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:28.720]  the ruling class seems to believe that obama
[1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:31.880]  would have a chance to make his case to the world and get some
[1:56:31.880 --> 1:56:33.400]  result uh...
[1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:37.320]  the only answer to that is continuous mobilization including on these uh...
[1:56:37.320 --> 1:56:41.120]  on the economic issues and watch out for that state-sponsored compulsory
[1:56:41.120 --> 1:56:42.040]  cartel
[1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:45.200]  remember it's a state-sponsored compulsory cartel
[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:49.040]  designed to reduce production to reduce wages
[1:56:49.040 --> 1:56:50.280]  and to pop up
[1:56:50.280 --> 1:56:54.160]  financial instruments let's take a call uh... john and ohio
[1:56:54.160 --> 1:56:56.760]  you're on the air john skipping ahead because i want to get your perspective
[1:56:56.760 --> 1:56:58.360]  go ahead john
[1:56:58.360 --> 1:57:03.040]  yes uh... i i i i really appreciate what uh... webster is that is doing here
[1:57:03.040 --> 1:57:04.000]  and uh...
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:07.800]  i i think that we've also got to develop an international perspective i don't
[1:57:07.800 --> 1:57:11.000]  love the organization but the uh... socialist uh...
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:14.520]  w s w s dot or points out that if we're going to walk
[1:57:14.520 --> 1:57:16.760]  uh... take the pressure off of uh...
[1:57:16.760 --> 1:57:21.240]  uh... sacrifice in austere and on for instance the united auto workers they're
[1:57:21.240 --> 1:57:24.760]  doing the same thing that to every auto worker in europe
[1:57:24.760 --> 1:57:27.320]  where these two plants have international uh...
[1:57:27.320 --> 1:57:30.680]  subsidiaries and that we've got to make these links and i think
[1:57:30.680 --> 1:57:35.440]  we've got to expose uh... obama not as a uh... any kind of a liberal
[1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:39.520]  uh... in every case uh... the people are just reading into his but his uh...
[1:57:39.520 --> 1:57:44.760]  uh... positions i called uh... a pittsburgh talk show host who had been totally against bush
[1:57:44.760 --> 1:57:46.520]  and i pointed out that uh...
[1:57:46.520 --> 1:57:50.520]  obama was carrying out the same things in his bombing of pakistan
[1:57:50.520 --> 1:57:54.840]  and he said well he's got to do that because uh... he'd be criticized
[1:57:54.840 --> 1:57:58.200]  uh... by the uh... the republicans john cognor is that one
[1:57:58.200 --> 1:58:01.680]  he promised that he would uh... institute articles of impeachment
[1:58:01.680 --> 1:58:06.360]  uh... uh... reneged on that cindy sheen and the reama govern went to his office
[1:58:06.360 --> 1:58:10.360]  said well i can't do that i'd be criticized by fox and he had uh... had
[1:58:10.360 --> 1:58:12.860]  those people arrested and taken out
[1:58:12.860 --> 1:58:14.040]  so i think uh...
[1:58:14.040 --> 1:58:17.040]  uh... i really appreciate what you're doing uh...
[1:58:17.040 --> 1:58:21.200]  but i i think we've got to develop an international uh... perspective as well
[1:58:21.200 --> 1:58:24.160]  before the bankers on the left as well john
[1:58:24.160 --> 1:58:26.760]  i understand that i'm listening i appreciate your call we're gonna come

[2:00:36.840 --> 2:00:43.560]  hello alex i'm gonna listen there for a long long time and i i am so excited to
[2:00:43.560 --> 2:00:49.080]  hear that more and more people are waking up to this tyranny um i just had a
[2:00:49.080 --> 2:00:54.200]  quote to for you guys uh by thomas jefferson
[2:00:54.200 --> 2:00:57.640]  um the strongest reason for the people to retain their right to keep in their
[2:00:57.640 --> 2:01:01.320]  arms is the last resort to protect themselves against
[2:01:01.320 --> 2:01:07.240]  tyranny and government and i'm with the liberty campaign and me and my
[2:01:07.240 --> 2:01:11.160]  husband we've been waking people up passing out you know
[2:01:11.160 --> 2:01:15.720]  times and times in movies you know with the end game and everything and
[2:01:15.720 --> 2:01:20.600]  we just we love our kids and we want to protect our family you know and
[2:01:20.600 --> 2:01:25.880]  um it scares me you know and well you're doing the only
[2:01:25.880 --> 2:01:28.920]  laura you're doing the only thing you can do is getting up on your hind legs and
[2:01:28.920 --> 2:01:32.600]  fighting and i know it's scary but not fighting these people is
[2:01:32.600 --> 2:01:36.280]  even more scary because they will destroy our nation like they've done
[2:01:36.280 --> 2:01:39.800]  hundreds of other third world countries and give us no quarter
[2:01:39.800 --> 2:01:45.880]  yes like with hitler and the rice pack you know and i just i pray every day
[2:01:45.880 --> 2:01:49.800]  that more and more people will open up to this and stand with
[2:01:49.800 --> 2:01:53.240]  you know their their guns and you know instead of going and giving their
[2:01:53.240 --> 2:01:57.800]  guns out for roses in south carolina it just
[2:01:57.800 --> 2:02:03.400]  boggles me you know i mean we are definitely going to fight this
[2:02:03.400 --> 2:02:05.880]  though and we are going to stand behind you guys and
[2:02:05.880 --> 2:02:09.960]  you know we're the obama deception and everything we're going to get those
[2:02:09.960 --> 2:02:13.480]  movies we're going to do what we can and we've been
[2:02:13.480 --> 2:02:18.760]  listening to you for years and we just we we love our family will protect them
[2:02:18.760 --> 2:02:22.520]  you know and i mean i'm just so nervous because i think
[2:02:22.520 --> 2:02:26.120]  a cop just slowly drive by my apartment you know
[2:02:26.120 --> 2:02:30.600]  a few times now and well they're doing that everywhere they're not after you a
[2:02:30.600 --> 2:02:33.880]  lot of the police are on our side and waking up and
[2:02:33.880 --> 2:02:38.520]  god bless you laura let me just say this and it's not hype when i say it there
[2:02:38.520 --> 2:02:43.240]  is an explosive awakening happening to tyranny right now webster
[2:02:43.240 --> 2:02:46.760]  i mean are you not seeing an explosive awakening
[2:02:46.760 --> 2:02:50.360]  well i think you're going to find a an upsurge in political activity this year
[2:02:50.360 --> 2:02:52.920]  and that's what i recommend is political organizing
[2:02:52.920 --> 2:02:57.320]  and uh... it's it's it's important to make sure that it's done in a
[2:02:57.320 --> 2:03:01.240]  sophisticated differentiated way i i recommend another book that i have
[2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:03.960]  coming out surviving the cataclysm your guide to the
[2:03:03.960 --> 2:03:07.240]  worst financial crisis in human history that was published
[2:03:07.240 --> 2:03:10.120]  about ten years ago but i've got a second edition
[2:03:10.120 --> 2:03:13.640]  coming out and i try to show you know what what an economic program
[2:03:13.640 --> 2:03:17.640]  would look like i would also tell the lady you should be optimistic
[2:03:17.640 --> 2:03:21.080]  uh... we know how to deal with depression uh... american history in the 20th
[2:03:21.080 --> 2:03:25.160]  century 1930s in particular shows how you defeated
[2:03:25.160 --> 2:03:28.360]  depression there's no reason to let a depression wash over you
[2:03:28.360 --> 2:03:31.320]  depression is often followed by authoritarian government
[2:03:31.320 --> 2:03:34.280]  we don't need that we know how to fight it we can fight it
[2:03:34.280 --> 2:03:37.480]  we can take a depression outflank it defeated break it up
[2:03:37.480 --> 2:03:41.560]  and go on to uh... a better life in in the future and i urge people to think
[2:03:41.560 --> 2:03:45.560]  about it in those terms optimism not fatalism not pessimism
[2:03:45.560 --> 2:03:48.440]  because obama feeds off the spare right obama's
[2:03:48.440 --> 2:03:51.000]  hope and change is based on the idea that everybody's
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:55.640]  out there isolated in despair don't be and the absolutely uh... being powered
[2:03:55.640 --> 2:04:00.680]  take action and uh... i mean webster in the final minute we have
[2:04:00.680 --> 2:04:05.240]  and i want your just simple answer i don't think obama is doing as well as
[2:04:05.240 --> 2:04:09.480]  the globalistic plan i see him already beginning to slow and stall
[2:04:09.480 --> 2:04:14.200]  that is cause for celebration we've got to take control the information get the
[2:04:14.200 --> 2:04:16.040]  truth out are you not seeing
[2:04:16.040 --> 2:04:19.480]  the same thing i mean that's optimism and and we have evidence of that
[2:04:19.480 --> 2:04:22.120]  i think you're right i think we're about one third of the way through the
[2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:25.160]  hundred days and the damage is on the whole left
[2:04:25.160 --> 2:04:27.400]  then i thought it would be by this point in this
[2:04:27.400 --> 2:04:31.480]  this austerity sacrifice and gouging summit today
[2:04:31.480 --> 2:04:35.400]  is a very low-key version of what was originally planned so
[2:04:35.400 --> 2:04:38.840]  there's some reason for cautious optimism but only if you continue to
[2:04:38.840 --> 2:04:43.160]  mobilize and uh... and fight the idea that the government should be controlled
[2:04:43.160 --> 2:04:46.440]  by wall speed in the way that obama is absolutely hard of the matter we're in
[2:04:46.440 --> 2:04:49.160]  deep duty but we've got a chance to fight our way out of it
[2:04:49.160 --> 2:04:54.360]  if we develop fury with purpose and information to take action
[2:04:54.360 --> 2:04:58.600]  webster terribly thank you for joining us get his books at info wars dot com take

[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:42.840]  minutes of the broadcast today well last week we heard about it
[2:08:42.840 --> 2:08:45.720]  this sign we've got a copy of it from the man
[2:08:45.720 --> 2:08:52.520]  himself abort obama not the unborn and that is a clear message
[2:08:52.520 --> 2:08:56.840]  a political speech saying get him out of office abort abort a mission
[2:08:56.840 --> 2:09:04.360]  you know remove him not children and we have the press report i'm going to
[2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:08.120]  play a clip of coming up and there's others where during the campaign the
[2:09:08.120 --> 2:09:10.920]  obama campaign said arrest people that criticize
[2:09:10.920 --> 2:09:13.720]  obama people couldn't believe it until it was on the news and the governor of
[2:09:13.720 --> 2:09:15.960]  missouri and others spoke about it headline
[2:09:15.960 --> 2:09:20.760]  missouri governor rnc obama campaign has stench of police state
[2:09:20.760 --> 2:09:24.600]  well we're seeing an expansion of that the fairness doctrine moves to shut down
[2:09:24.600 --> 2:09:27.880]  the internet as we know the internet too it's all happening
[2:09:27.880 --> 2:09:33.000]  here is the daily oklahoma story also another one out of the news of oklahoma
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:35.960]  oklahoma city police chief officer pulls man over
[2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:39.480]  for anti obama sign then they took his sign
[2:09:39.480 --> 2:09:43.320]  cited him said he was basically gave him a ticket but
[2:09:43.320 --> 2:09:47.400]  but not a fine saying you're now a part of an investigation
[2:09:47.400 --> 2:09:51.560]  then the secret service called him on his cell phone said we're going to be at
[2:09:51.560 --> 2:09:54.440]  your house they said we want to inspect it to make
[2:09:54.440 --> 2:09:58.920]  sure you're not part of a quote hate group and so we are joined by chip
[2:09:58.920 --> 2:10:03.400]  harrison that this happened to here in the united states and mr harrison
[2:10:03.400 --> 2:10:07.480]  thanks for coming on with us you bet mr jones glad to be here
[2:10:07.480 --> 2:10:11.400]  tell us uh when all we had previously was the press reports
[2:10:11.400 --> 2:10:14.680]  about this we hadn't really heard from you tell us specifically
[2:10:14.680 --> 2:10:18.040]  what happened and then give us your take on what it was like having the secret
[2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:22.840]  service come out there and go after your first amendment i guess
[2:10:22.840 --> 2:10:27.880]  well um i was on the interstate and then i was passed by a um
[2:10:27.880 --> 2:10:34.040]  oklahoma city police department car um the car slowed down got in beside me i
[2:10:34.040 --> 2:10:36.920]  had to make another lane change and go to another
[2:10:36.920 --> 2:10:41.160]  intersection on the interstate and um i noticed that they were following me
[2:10:41.160 --> 2:10:45.640]  fairly closely they followed me for about three miles i'm assuming having a
[2:10:45.640 --> 2:10:48.920]  conversation there was two police officers about um
[2:10:48.920 --> 2:10:52.280]  what they were going to do with this line in the back of my truck they pulled me
[2:10:52.280 --> 2:10:55.320]  over um both of them got out of the vehicle approached
[2:10:55.320 --> 2:10:59.560]  my vehicle said you know i were pulling you over sir and i said i have absolutely
[2:10:59.560 --> 2:11:04.280]  no idea i had a uh dissipating traffic laws i i'm clueless and they said it's
[2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:06.920]  because of the sign in the back of your vehicle
[2:11:06.920 --> 2:11:13.160]  um i said uh my aborto obama not the unborn sign i said sir that's just a
[2:11:13.160 --> 2:11:16.360]  um an anti-abortion statement you know it's just uh basically i'm trying to
[2:11:16.360 --> 2:11:21.320]  draw attention to president obama's uh abortion policies and um
[2:11:21.320 --> 2:11:24.280]  one of the police officers says well do you know what the word abort means and i
[2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:29.160]  said to terminate or to remove and at that time he said no it means to kill
[2:11:29.160 --> 2:11:33.000]  so you're basically saying to kill president obama
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:36.360]  um at that time i said no sir i wrote the sign i know what
[2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:43.080]  i i meant wanted it to mean and uh he uh said well we're gonna have to confiscate
[2:11:43.080 --> 2:11:48.040]  the sign so they took the sign from me told me to go in about my way gave me a
[2:11:48.040 --> 2:11:54.280]  citizen's assistance form um so when i got to work i felt like uh my first
[2:11:54.280 --> 2:11:59.080]  amendment rights had been totally violated so i made a couple of calls the
[2:11:59.080 --> 2:12:02.840]  police department said we'll give back a hold of you for approximately two hours
[2:12:02.840 --> 2:12:06.680]  later a supervisor brought me my sign back and just said that the secret
[2:12:06.680 --> 2:12:11.320]  service had been notified and um as far as the secret service was concerned
[2:12:11.320 --> 2:12:14.520]  that this was um i wasn't in any in any way a threat living in
[2:12:14.520 --> 2:12:18.840]  oklahoma and i believe president obama was in canada at the time so
[2:12:18.840 --> 2:12:22.360]  um later that day i get a call from the secret service
[2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:27.320]  they're at my house um they uh want to perform a field interview
[2:12:27.320 --> 2:12:32.120]  um i said well i'm at work right now and i really can't afford to take off they
[2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:36.600]  said you know well we need you to be here to perform this interview
[2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:41.560]  so uh i stopped um on on the way back through
[2:12:41.560 --> 2:12:45.720]  oklahoma city because it was clear on the other side of town and um
[2:12:45.720 --> 2:12:49.640]  stopped by and uh went by my church talked to my pastor for a few moments
[2:12:49.640 --> 2:12:54.520]  contacted a lawyer and he's he seemed to think that we weren't
[2:12:54.520 --> 2:13:00.120]  them it wasn't the the stereotype that we have of um law enforcement you see
[2:13:00.120 --> 2:13:03.320]  coming in kicking your door down around second your house and
[2:13:03.320 --> 2:13:08.680]  um so i was heading back um back across town and
[2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:13.400]  the secret service called me again and just reaffirmed what the lawyer told me
[2:13:13.400 --> 2:13:16.360]  look sir we're not here to disrupt any part of your house we're just going to
[2:13:16.360 --> 2:13:18.920]  make sure that you're not a part of a hate group have any
[2:13:18.920 --> 2:13:23.960]  um posters up with obama on it with the bull's eye or anything like that i feel
[2:13:23.960 --> 2:13:27.160]  well you know i have a two and a half year old special needs daughter at home
[2:13:27.160 --> 2:13:31.080]  my wife's there i just the easier we make this on my family the better off
[2:13:31.080 --> 2:13:35.080]  because i understand your your concern here i think the police officer was a
[2:13:35.080 --> 2:13:38.920]  little overzealous a little biased and uh
[2:13:38.920 --> 2:13:43.160]  the police officers came in um made a quick walk through my are not i'm sorry
[2:13:43.160 --> 2:13:46.920]  the secret service came in make a quick um tour through my house and then we
[2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:50.040]  performed the rest of the interview outside and um
[2:13:50.040 --> 2:13:55.480]  that's about the gist of it well this is meant to be a chilling effect across
[2:13:55.480 --> 2:13:59.240]  the country and the obama campaign has asked police and prosecutors in
[2:13:59.240 --> 2:14:04.360]  illinois missouri uh connecticut vermont many other states to harass people
[2:14:04.360 --> 2:14:07.400]  and they have a arrest and arrested people
[2:14:07.400 --> 2:14:10.840]  uh and they'll allow an obama group without a permit to worship him in an
[2:14:10.840 --> 2:14:13.480]  event or at some other event but if you come up and
[2:14:13.480 --> 2:14:17.240]  speak out against obama they tell you to get off the property or you're arrested
[2:14:17.240 --> 2:14:20.840]  so this is part of a larger program i'm not singling out the secret service
[2:14:20.840 --> 2:14:24.440]  agents themselves uh but uh this is a crime against the first
[2:14:24.440 --> 2:14:28.120]  amendment and the Oklahoma police knew a good and well
[2:14:28.120 --> 2:14:32.520]  what they were doing and it's shameful and i happen to have the fbi training
[2:14:32.520 --> 2:14:37.000]  manuals and this i also have the federal marshal slat training manuals
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:41.640]  those are in my films like road to tyranny and in there uh i've got law
[2:14:41.640 --> 2:14:44.840]  enforcement publications where they say if someone's got a get us out of the
[2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:47.800]  un sticker this is word for word on their car go
[2:14:47.800 --> 2:14:51.480]  ahead and take them to jail and then it says police chief support your
[2:14:51.480 --> 2:14:54.520]  officers because this person is probably a terrorist
[2:14:54.520 --> 2:14:57.720]  they say those that make frequent references to the u.s constitution
[2:14:57.720 --> 2:15:01.000]  should be on terror list they say they want they want to put you on a
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:04.360]  no fly list you then can own a gun uh they're wanting to make it where you're
[2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:06.920]  on a no a 25 000 americans on average are added each
[2:15:06.920 --> 2:15:11.400]  month now over a million and so it's much more sinister
[2:15:11.400 --> 2:15:15.160]  because i've been researching it but i just made those points so would you
[2:15:15.160 --> 2:15:17.960]  like to comment on what i was just saying
[2:15:17.960 --> 2:15:22.280]  yeah um you know i um over the last eight years
[2:15:22.280 --> 2:15:28.280]  and i've just known the um the hate grow for president bush and i've seen
[2:15:28.280 --> 2:15:32.040]  bumper stickers t-shirt signs that were
[2:15:32.040 --> 2:15:37.240]  far worse than an abort obama not the unborn sign
[2:15:37.240 --> 2:15:42.040]  and um i agree when i first got pulled over i thought
[2:15:42.040 --> 2:15:47.800]  am i in cuba or russia or china is this really happening to me right now
[2:15:47.800 --> 2:15:51.880]  and and and it was chilling it really made me decide you know that that i need
[2:15:51.880 --> 2:15:57.720]  to go public with this and um um as as a christian and also as a
[2:15:57.720 --> 2:16:00.360]  strong first amendment second amendment rights person
[2:16:00.360 --> 2:16:03.240]  um we're gonna have to make a stand sooner or later we're gonna have to make
[2:16:03.240 --> 2:16:06.600]  a stand and did the did the sacred service
[2:16:06.600 --> 2:16:10.680]  uh ask you about your firearms uh yeah though
[2:16:10.680 --> 2:16:15.160]  actually we think no they didn't they did not
[2:16:15.160 --> 2:16:18.440]  yeah well yeah if they were really after you they probably knew how stupid
[2:16:18.440 --> 2:16:21.720]  this was they would have uh tried to say oh you're planning something violent oh
[2:16:21.720 --> 2:16:26.920]  you're you're gonna do something uh what were the hate group questions like
[2:16:26.920 --> 2:16:30.120]  um they just concerned um whether i had any friends
[2:16:30.120 --> 2:16:33.480]  that um had any ill will towards president obama
[2:16:33.480 --> 2:16:40.280]  um if i had ever thought about joining any um hate groups um just just basic
[2:16:40.280 --> 2:16:43.240]  questions like that they didn't they didn't go into great detail they were
[2:16:43.240 --> 2:16:48.360]  all pretty vague questions but i mean to me the the answers were
[2:16:48.360 --> 2:16:52.760]  pretty obviously you know no on all well i mean number one it's the idea that
[2:16:52.760 --> 2:16:56.840]  they say what's hateful and now you're part of some bad groups that you don't
[2:16:56.840 --> 2:17:00.280]  have any rights i want to play you one of many newscast
[2:17:00.280 --> 2:17:03.240]  when we first reported this people couldn't believe it but then it was
[2:17:03.240 --> 2:17:08.520]  confirmed uh here is a minute and a half clip of Missouri news here it is
[2:17:08.520 --> 2:17:12.280]  senator barack obama's presidential campaign is asking Missouri law enforcement
[2:17:12.280 --> 2:17:16.760]  to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading television ad
[2:17:16.760 --> 2:17:19.800]  during the presidential campaign this was john mills's live at the county
[2:17:19.800 --> 2:17:23.000]  election board in maple but he's been learning more about which members of
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:26.120]  law enforcement are getting involved in this john tell us
[2:17:26.120 --> 2:17:29.160]  more about this russia good evening prosecutors and
[2:17:29.160 --> 2:17:33.400]  sheriffs from across missouri are joining something called the barack obama
[2:17:33.400 --> 2:17:38.360]  truth squad two high-profile prosecutors are part of the team
[2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:41.160]  we met them this afternoon in the central west end

[2:17:45.160 --> 2:17:49.400]  prosecuting attorney they will be reminding voters that barack obama is a
[2:17:49.400 --> 2:17:52.600]  christian who wants to cut taxes for anyone making
[2:17:52.600 --> 2:17:56.680]  less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year they also say they plan
[2:17:56.680 --> 2:18:01.000]  to respond immediately to any ads and statements that might
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:07.400]  violate missouri ethics laws we want to keep this campaign focused on issues
[2:18:07.400 --> 2:18:10.280]  we don't want people to get distracted and the missourians don't want to be
[2:18:10.280 --> 2:18:15.160]  distracted by these divisive character attacks so we're here to respond to any
[2:18:15.160 --> 2:18:19.240]  character attacks to set the record straight whether it is uh directly
[2:18:19.240 --> 2:18:23.080]  attributable to the campaign or to one of the soft money operations if they're
[2:18:23.080 --> 2:18:25.640]  not going to tell the truth and somebody's got to step up and say
[2:18:25.640 --> 2:18:29.560]  wait a minute that's not true this is the truth
[2:18:29.560 --> 2:18:32.760]  now the obama campaign tells news four that others
[2:18:32.760 --> 2:18:36.600]  prosecutors and sheriffs are also part of the team including some from the
[2:18:36.600 --> 2:18:40.040]  kansas city area and from rural parts of missouri
[2:18:40.040 --> 2:18:44.040]  we're also told the truth squad is expected to include jefferson county
[2:18:44.040 --> 2:18:48.280]  sheriff glenn boyer live in maple wood john mills news four
[2:18:48.280 --> 2:18:53.080]  all right so talk about soviet union there's the intimidation you don't talk
[2:18:53.080 --> 2:18:58.520]  about about him or will arrest you in no judge no jury nothing civil will decide
[2:18:58.520 --> 2:19:02.280]  if it's true or not does that sound like freedom
[2:19:02.280 --> 2:19:06.920]  no sir not in the least um you know one one thing about i i i heard on that
[2:19:06.920 --> 2:19:11.000]  report was if um president obama is a self-provest
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:14.920]  christian well then knowing when life begins
[2:19:14.920 --> 2:19:19.160]  is um it's pretty much an issue that he should know it's not above his
[2:19:19.160 --> 2:19:22.280]  pay his pay grade you know um as a christian
[2:19:22.280 --> 2:19:26.760]  life begins at conception and for him to play both sides of this is to me just
[2:19:26.760 --> 2:19:30.120]  extremely deceitful well we'll talk more about it in the next segment
[2:19:30.120 --> 2:19:34.600]  whether you've got a few more minutes with us but on record he wanted to vote
[2:19:34.600 --> 2:19:38.600]  for bills that would allow them to kill babies outside the womb and folks that
[2:19:38.600 --> 2:19:41.240]  don't know this even the most pro-abortion groups
[2:19:41.240 --> 2:19:46.040]  who were against it he infanticide uh so he wanted to maybe you know it was
[2:19:46.040 --> 2:19:48.680]  accidentally born at the mortuary for him to be able to go ahead and kill it
[2:19:48.680 --> 2:19:52.520]  which is the policy they already do that and the law turns a blind eye to it
[2:19:52.520 --> 2:19:56.760]  so he is for infanticide is charles key's been talking about we got a clip of

[2:24:21.880 --> 2:24:24.760]  things out about a warrant make sure he wasn't
[2:24:24.760 --> 2:24:29.480]  part of the hate group um you just heard me
[2:24:29.480 --> 2:24:34.200]  play that clip uh with them threatening everybody not to basically bad mouth
[2:24:34.200 --> 2:24:37.720]  obama uh they're now going after talk radio they're
[2:24:37.720 --> 2:24:40.680]  now saying they're going to try to regulate speech on the web
[2:24:40.680 --> 2:24:44.120]  uh and then meanwhile obama's lied about everything he promised he would do
[2:24:44.120 --> 2:24:47.800]  except for raising taxes he is uh following that promise
[2:24:47.800 --> 2:24:52.680]  um just overall your take on the state of the nation right now
[2:24:52.680 --> 2:24:58.600]  um i just i just see uh president obama socialist agenda coming through just
[2:24:58.600 --> 2:25:04.440]  like he he um planned it to um i think the uh
[2:25:04.440 --> 2:25:10.680]  the congress is is um for a lack of better words disgraceful
[2:25:10.680 --> 2:25:16.840]  um i think the uh the democratic control along with um
[2:25:16.840 --> 2:25:21.080]  the our democratic president um i just i just think we're in sorry shape right
[2:25:21.080 --> 2:25:23.720]  now and i think it's time for americans to start
[2:25:23.720 --> 2:25:27.960]  standing up and standing strong sir
[2:25:28.280 --> 2:25:34.760]  are you aware of his votes for infanticide in the senate uh yes
[2:25:34.760 --> 2:25:38.680]  actually i've been viewing uh the last couple of days just
[2:25:38.680 --> 2:25:42.680]  going over um all sorts of information that i received from the
[2:25:42.680 --> 2:25:48.200]  national life to life council um and just and and polls and um
[2:25:48.200 --> 2:25:52.920]  it's i you know i and and seeing senator pelosi
[2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:59.320]  um comments that she's made and as and senator boxer um argument she made
[2:25:59.320 --> 2:26:03.480]  against uh uh governor centoro um a few years ago
[2:26:03.480 --> 2:26:08.360]  um i i'm just i'm i'm i'm at all i don't even know what to say
[2:26:08.360 --> 2:26:12.760]  well you know obama doubled the funding for the chinese forced abortions
[2:26:12.760 --> 2:26:16.600]  that's on record and for abortions and things in africa
[2:26:16.600 --> 2:26:19.880]  i mean that's not a friend of black folks is it uh making sure they don't
[2:26:19.880 --> 2:26:23.560]  ever get into the world that's that's exactly correct and
[2:26:23.560 --> 2:26:27.720]  you know they um he overturned the mexico city policy which now means that
[2:26:27.720 --> 2:26:30.680]  up to a hundred million dollars can go to mexico
[2:26:30.680 --> 2:26:37.240]  to um to help um use abortion directly as a population control
[2:26:37.240 --> 2:26:40.440]  and um i read some some statistics that said you know
[2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:45.240]  the majority of um hispanic people by far seventy five percent of them are
[2:26:45.240 --> 2:26:50.680]  pro-life and it just you know to use this as a foreign policy as i
[2:26:50.680 --> 2:26:54.200]  think disgraceful also well the media spends that they always say
[2:26:54.200 --> 2:26:57.160]  hey people don't want to control the borders because they want the hispanic
[2:26:57.160 --> 2:26:59.400]  vote but upwards of 80 percent of hispanics
[2:26:59.400 --> 2:27:02.520]  want to control the borders just like all other americans and they always say
[2:27:02.520 --> 2:27:05.000]  oh we want the hispanic vote we want to give them
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:09.880]  health care uh but but but but hispanics are some of the
[2:27:09.880 --> 2:27:12.760]  most pro-life people and pro-family people out there
[2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:16.440]  and and so they always set it up like oh this group wants this
[2:27:16.440 --> 2:27:21.480]  that's not what they want no no absolutely not it's um it's once again
[2:27:21.480 --> 2:27:25.960]  it's it's the spin and the uh i think you know also the media
[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:29.000]  the the general media plays a part in this too
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:32.200]  and there's their reluctancy to report the truth um
[2:27:32.200 --> 2:27:35.480]  like bernie goldwood's uh title of his book um
[2:27:35.480 --> 2:27:39.720]  a slobbering love affair over brocco mama just just nips it right in the bud
[2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:43.960]  right there well you're absolutely right when
[2:27:43.960 --> 2:27:48.120]  we come back i'm gonna play a clip of keys to stop obama or us will cease to
[2:27:48.120 --> 2:27:51.720]  exist from youtube and i like the way he makes the point but but i want to be
[2:27:51.720 --> 2:27:55.320]  clear so we don't get caught in the same trap in four to eight years
[2:27:55.320 --> 2:27:58.760]  george bush tripled the size of government george bush is a globalist
[2:27:58.760 --> 2:28:01.160]  george bush supported the assault weapons ban
[2:28:01.160 --> 2:28:04.840]  and this is what conservatives get for supporting him and compromising
[2:28:04.840 --> 2:28:09.720]  this is what we're going to get uh you know if if true conservatives don't
[2:28:09.720 --> 2:28:12.360]  stand up and take this nation back and then educate
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:16.600]  uh the dumb down mainline liberals and so i want to just point out here that
[2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:21.240]  you know you know mr keys and others uh allen keys
[2:28:21.240 --> 2:28:25.720]  and others can talk about all of this stuff all day and act like republicans
[2:28:25.720 --> 2:28:28.760]  are going to be our saviors most republicans are bought and paid for by
[2:28:28.760 --> 2:28:34.440]  the same globalist yes sir yep i i totally agree with that i think
[2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:38.680]  you know i i think uh living here in oklahoma i i see a lot of a political
[2:28:38.680 --> 2:28:41.800]  party division here but generally speaking
[2:28:41.800 --> 2:28:45.560]  oklahomans are conservatives and i feel that the majority
[2:28:45.560 --> 2:28:49.240]  of the united states is conservative i think and we've got
[2:28:49.240 --> 2:28:54.280]  um into this political battle instead of looking at what our basic policies are
[2:28:54.280 --> 2:28:58.200]  and and our policies are that of our forefathers you know we we have certain
[2:28:58.200 --> 2:29:01.240]  rights and we need to stand up for those rights and when when government starts
[2:29:01.240 --> 2:29:05.880]  taking those rights first from us we we need to be vocal about it
[2:29:05.880 --> 2:29:09.240]  well i hope they don't use your case and many others like it for a chilling
[2:29:09.240 --> 2:29:12.840]  effect where others just give up and shut up and all the or the secret service
[2:29:12.840 --> 2:29:16.680]  is going to come get us i hope people realize that if more of us stand up and
[2:29:16.680 --> 2:29:20.600]  say no they can't put us all on list they can't harass us all
[2:29:20.600 --> 2:29:24.200]  they are trying to suppress our speech because they know it's so powerful
[2:29:24.200 --> 2:29:29.880]  and can't expose their agenda exactly yes i agree a hundred percent so if i have
[2:29:29.880 --> 2:29:32.920]  to take the brunt of some of this so i get some other people to stand up and
[2:29:32.920 --> 2:29:37.160]  be loud and that's fine with me chipp harrison as things unfold we may

[2:35:28.280 --> 2:35:32.360]  okay i want to go ahead and play this
[2:35:32.360 --> 2:35:36.120]  alan key's clip he was ambassador to the united nations
[2:35:36.120 --> 2:35:40.120]  under reagan i think i called him charles key earlier thinking of the state
[2:35:40.120 --> 2:35:43.800]  representative trying to pass state sovereignty in oklahoma
[2:35:43.800 --> 2:35:46.920]  and i've interviewed him several times over the years
[2:35:46.920 --> 2:35:51.880]  uh in fact went and covered one of his debates back in the 96 in dalis
[2:35:51.880 --> 2:35:57.080]  was at 95 republican candidate debates and i agree with everything he's
[2:35:57.080 --> 2:35:59.560]  saying except for the fact that he keeps implying
[2:35:59.560 --> 2:36:03.400]  republicans you know are going to save us somehow when they're bought and paid
[2:36:03.400 --> 2:36:08.920]  for i mean where was alan key's i i i guess to some extent he was there
[2:36:08.920 --> 2:36:13.160]  when george bush george w bush was expanding the police state going after
[2:36:13.160 --> 2:36:16.840]  the second amendment crippling the size of government this is non-partisan
[2:36:16.840 --> 2:36:19.880]  uh... other than that the points he makes about obama are very accurate
[2:36:19.880 --> 2:36:24.440]  but but you know saying obama's a socialist or a communist
[2:36:24.440 --> 2:36:28.360]  he is bought and paid for by offshore banks this is
[2:36:28.360 --> 2:36:31.800]  more closely akin to fascism or just piracy
[2:36:31.800 --> 2:36:35.080]  uh... but when he says obama is going to bring this country down and ruin it
[2:36:35.080 --> 2:36:37.800]  uh... certainly those controlling obama and using him to get their agenda
[2:36:37.800 --> 2:36:41.000]  through are doing that so i wanted to play part of this clip
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:46.200]  uh... over here and uh... breakdown
[2:36:46.200 --> 2:36:49.560]  what alan keys had to say here it is
[2:36:49.560 --> 2:36:53.400]  obama is a radical communist and i think it's becoming clear that's what i told
[2:36:53.400 --> 2:36:56.280]  people in illinois and now everybody realizes it's true
[2:36:56.280 --> 2:36:59.800]  he's going to destroy this country and we're either going to stop him
[2:36:59.800 --> 2:37:05.080]  or the united states of america is going to cease to exist
[2:37:05.080 --> 2:37:09.480]  do you still hold regrets against not having long enough time to debate against
[2:37:09.480 --> 2:37:11.720]  president obama i don't have any regrets i went into
[2:37:11.720 --> 2:37:15.240]  illinois people told me at the time i didn't stand much of a chance of winning
[2:37:15.240 --> 2:37:20.040]  the idea was to bear a true witness the man is an abomination
[2:37:20.040 --> 2:37:23.640]  he is someone who has actually advocated infanticide
[2:37:23.640 --> 2:37:27.720]  that when babies are the target of abortion if they happen to
[2:37:27.720 --> 2:37:31.720]  escape the abortionist's intention and are born alive
[2:37:31.720 --> 2:37:36.360]  he actually supported the idea that those babies should be set aside to die
[2:37:36.360 --> 2:37:39.720]  that is a man with such a seared conscience i can't even understand
[2:37:39.720 --> 2:37:44.200]  why anybody in their right mind would consider him worthy of political
[2:37:44.200 --> 2:37:47.000]  support that's a violation of conscience
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:50.520]  that is inconceivable and even some of the most
[2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:54.200]  hard-line pro-abortion people in america rejected
[2:37:54.200 --> 2:37:59.000]  that abomination and he did not so what does tonight mean
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:02.680]  when president obama is president of the united states
[2:38:02.680 --> 2:38:06.520]  is he that's another question is he president of the united states according
[2:38:06.520 --> 2:38:10.360]  to the constitution in order to be eligible for president you have to be a
[2:38:10.360 --> 2:38:14.120]  natural born citizen uh... he has refused to provide
[2:38:14.120 --> 2:38:16.680]  proof that he is in fact a natural born citizen
[2:38:16.680 --> 2:38:20.600]  and his ideal relationship stop right there for a moment
[2:38:20.600 --> 2:38:25.000]  see the republicans can't attack obama on the real issues of tripling the size
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  of government which he's openly expanding because bush did it
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:32.040]  and they can't attack him on the torture or the secret arrest or how he's
[2:38:32.040 --> 2:38:36.840]  continuing all that or expanding the wars because they were for it
[2:38:36.840 --> 2:38:40.200]  so they have to bring up this is he really in a
[2:38:40.200 --> 2:38:44.200]  you know proper american citizen who is his dad really
[2:38:44.200 --> 2:38:47.880]  instead of going after issues that the left would actually listen to
[2:38:47.880 --> 2:38:51.480]  let's go back to it and that he was born in Nairobi
[2:38:51.480 --> 2:38:55.640]  at a time when his mother was too young to transmit u.s. citizenship
[2:38:55.640 --> 2:38:59.240]  so i'm not even sure he's president of the united states no that's not a laughing
[2:38:59.240 --> 2:39:03.160]  matter neither are many of our military people now who are going to court
[2:39:03.160 --> 2:39:07.320]  to ask the question do we have to obey a man who is not qualified under the
[2:39:07.320 --> 2:39:09.880]  constitution we're in the midst of the greatest
[2:39:09.880 --> 2:39:14.040]  crisis this nation has ever seen and if we don't stop laughing about it and
[2:39:14.040 --> 2:39:17.800]  deal with it we're going to find ourselves in the midst of chaos
[2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:22.920]  confusion and civil war it's time we started acting like grown ups
[2:39:22.920 --> 2:39:27.160]  how could the policy that president obama makes in the next couple of years
[2:39:27.160 --> 2:39:31.560]  affect activities like sorry president of the the the the person you call
[2:39:31.560 --> 2:39:36.200]  president of obama and i frankly refuse to call it right at the moment he is
[2:39:36.200 --> 2:39:40.840]  somebody who is kind of an alleged usurper who is alleged to be someone
[2:39:40.840 --> 2:39:44.920]  who's occupying that office without constitutional warrant to do something
[2:39:44.920 --> 2:39:49.080]  and and he's rushing forward with ideas like destroying our borders
[2:39:49.080 --> 2:39:52.600]  and amnesty bill that will actually have the american taxpayer
[2:39:52.600 --> 2:39:55.880]  footing the bill for illegals to come to this country to
[2:39:55.880 --> 2:39:59.000]  live to get housing and to get everything they want
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:02.600]  he is also somebody who has just announced the program
[2:40:02.600 --> 2:40:06.280]  that is true and that's the old amnesty bill that bush
[2:40:06.280 --> 2:40:09.960]  lied about and said wasn't amnesty but kept secret that senator session leaked
[2:40:09.960 --> 2:40:13.800]  that the 20 loopholes where it would make aggravated felons legal and let
[2:40:13.800 --> 2:40:18.360]  anybody come here for six years so the families could bring their whole
[2:40:18.360 --> 2:40:21.960]  families in and then they go and get on welfare and their whole families paid
[2:40:21.960 --> 2:40:25.240]  for people say well how dare you be against the anchor babies we're going
[2:40:25.240 --> 2:40:28.600]  bankrupt the states are going bankrupt the country
[2:40:28.600 --> 2:40:32.760]  is falling apart there's only so many of us that actually have jobs and pay
[2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:37.560]  taxes and produce there's six billion people
[2:40:37.560 --> 2:40:41.480]  plus that want to come here have you seen how they live in india feel sorry
[2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:44.600]  for them have you seen how they live in mexico i feel sorry for them
[2:40:44.600 --> 2:40:48.600]  have you seen how they how they live in china
[2:40:48.600 --> 2:40:51.640]  you know of this country is the globalist plan to bring us down into a
[2:40:51.640 --> 2:40:54.280]  third world system destroy the middle class regardless of what color the
[2:40:54.280 --> 2:40:57.000]  middle class is black white ispanic asian
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:41:00.600]  so that we can be controlled and the elites are going to live in these
[2:41:00.600 --> 2:41:05.800]  rural armored compounds they say this themselves
[2:41:05.800 --> 2:41:10.280]  so he's absolutely right i mean you know there this new federal board they set
[2:41:10.280 --> 2:41:13.560]  up through the 19 million bucks to federalize health care records
[2:41:13.560 --> 2:41:17.640]  states i mean bloomberg quoted the bill i covered it last week
[2:41:17.640 --> 2:41:21.800]  and it passed in the package saying they're going to ration care to the old
[2:41:21.800 --> 2:41:26.920]  they're gonna have boards bioethicist boards that decide this was a lush limbaugh
[2:41:26.920 --> 2:41:30.040]  attacking saying they're going to cut off old people they always attack limbaugh
[2:41:30.040 --> 2:41:33.640]  and say that he's saying that you know that you know that he's lying and you
[2:41:33.640 --> 2:41:36.520]  know saying that the democrats want to you know do this or that to old people
[2:41:36.520 --> 2:41:40.600]  or the democrats say he wants to do that they're really doing it
[2:41:40.600 --> 2:41:43.560]  and i've got articles here where they're cutting off the money to the troops and
[2:41:43.560 --> 2:41:46.600]  their bonuses and their health care and that they have army
[2:41:46.600 --> 2:41:51.000]  uh... charities that are stealing the money of course
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:54.440]  look what job a bunch of big charities in effort nine eleven with over three
[2:41:54.440 --> 2:41:58.280]  billion dollars they used it for gun control groups and things united way and
[2:41:58.280 --> 2:42:01.560]  others oh it's it's it's bad let's finish up with
[2:42:01.560 --> 2:42:06.440]  the club that would essentially destroy the validity of
[2:42:06.440 --> 2:42:10.680]  existing mortgages and encourage everybody in the country to stop paying
[2:42:10.680 --> 2:42:13.800]  their mortgage because the government is going to pay it
[2:42:13.800 --> 2:42:18.200]  instead this is insanity it's as if we have put insane
[2:42:18.200 --> 2:42:21.240]  children and adolescents in charge of our government
[2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:25.160]  and i think we need to ask simple questions a couple years ago we were
[2:42:25.160 --> 2:42:27.880]  arguing over every penny in the united states budget
[2:42:27.880 --> 2:42:31.000]  and it was quite clear we didn't have enough money to go around
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:34.920]  well somebody asked me where we came up with two trillion dollars
[2:42:34.920 --> 2:42:39.160]  in the course of the last six months did we wish for it out of the air
[2:42:39.160 --> 2:42:44.040]  have people gone mad in this country you don't have that money
[2:42:44.040 --> 2:42:49.080]  we are claiming that a bankrupt government can save a bankrupt banking system
[2:42:49.080 --> 2:42:52.520]  explain to me how that happens because i think that's impossible
[2:42:52.520 --> 2:42:57.400]  and the fact that we have just elected an individual may or may not be qualified
[2:42:57.400 --> 2:43:01.160]  and he presents silly ideas like this and says let's move forward now
[2:43:01.160 --> 2:43:05.080]  and we're all acting like the laws of economics have been repealed
[2:43:05.080 --> 2:43:09.480]  and we can actually afford to put the bill with money nobody's got
[2:43:09.480 --> 2:43:12.920]  this is insane it's got to lead to the collapse of our economy
[2:43:12.920 --> 2:43:17.960]  and it's going to all right there you have it i want to go to some of your
[2:43:17.960 --> 2:43:22.200]  calls but i want to analyze this propaganda piece
[2:43:22.200 --> 2:43:27.960]  from cnn i want to critique this and break it down
[2:43:27.960 --> 2:43:33.400]  this is cnn in fact john i wasn't thinking you have the audio clip at the
[2:43:33.400 --> 2:43:36.760]  network level can you send the cnn youtube clip to my
[2:43:36.760 --> 2:43:40.200]  guys down here i'm still in the old system of minnesota playing the clips
[2:43:40.200 --> 2:43:44.680]  instead of my own my own studio that clip about face scanners
[2:43:44.680 --> 2:43:52.520]  in the in the malls do you have that yes big brother watching you
[2:43:52.520 --> 2:43:56.360]  send that to my guys and we'll play that coming up here in a few minutes because
[2:43:56.360 --> 2:43:59.880]  because they only tell you that the companies have put in
[2:43:59.880 --> 2:44:04.120]  this minority report style face scanning
[2:44:04.120 --> 2:44:08.040]  billboards in the malls that have hidden cameras that scan your face
[2:44:08.040 --> 2:44:11.640]  folks again go back to shows five six seven eight nine years ago my films
[2:44:11.640 --> 2:44:15.880]  because we had the pentagon documents this is pentagon darpa designed
[2:44:15.880 --> 2:44:20.280]  and they're using face scans digital photos from the driver's license which
[2:44:20.280 --> 2:44:23.560]  is really federalized as i told you in my first film america destroyed by
[2:44:23.560 --> 2:44:27.800]  design released in 1997 hard to believe 12 years
[2:44:27.800 --> 2:44:32.200]  ago that film um we show there how they're
[2:44:32.200 --> 2:44:34.680]  going to put these face scanners up now they're already up on the street
[2:44:34.680 --> 2:44:38.120]  corners and everywhere and they use your driver's license photo to get the
[2:44:38.120 --> 2:44:42.280]  algorithm so i want to get into that uh coming up
[2:44:42.280 --> 2:44:45.640]  near the end of the shower but right now let's go ahead and talk to z
[2:44:45.640 --> 2:44:49.160]  in north carolina z you were on the air
[2:44:49.160 --> 2:44:54.920]  alex uh thank you for having me on um i'd like to i know it sounds cliche
[2:44:54.920 --> 2:44:59.160]  but i'd like to thank you for uh for waking me up thank you and
[2:44:59.160 --> 2:45:03.560]  yeah and i uh it all started about six months ago for me and uh i'm going to
[2:45:03.560 --> 2:45:06.360]  tell you two quick stories and i'll let you hear what you have to say about
[2:45:06.360 --> 2:45:09.640]  them but i i heard you on coast to coast a m
[2:45:09.640 --> 2:45:12.920]  shortly after i read michael kraighton's book state of fear
[2:45:12.920 --> 2:45:17.000]  and uh again it was uh it was uh just like
[2:45:17.000 --> 2:45:20.600]  didn't that bucket of cold water thrown on me but for those that don't know
[2:45:20.600 --> 2:45:23.640]  kraighton's book is where a global group of bankers
[2:45:23.640 --> 2:45:27.800]  are staging environmental crises to bring in a world tax
[2:45:27.800 --> 2:45:31.320]  yeah it was uh it was something and and you know when i picked up that book i
[2:45:31.320 --> 2:45:34.760]  thought for sure kraighton was going to be pro global warming and
[2:45:34.760 --> 2:45:38.280]  i remember just being cool anyway that i don't have to say any more about that
[2:45:38.280 --> 2:45:42.200]  but um one one thing that happened to me about two months before that as i went
[2:45:42.200 --> 2:45:45.240]  through the airport and i had a pocket knife and uh
[2:45:45.240 --> 2:45:49.880]  i gave it up i realized i still had it and i just gave it to the lady working
[2:45:49.880 --> 2:45:54.600]  at the uh the security and i said yeah i forgot to leave this at home and
[2:45:54.600 --> 2:45:58.600]  she gave it to her supervisor and she didn't even tell him that i just
[2:45:58.600 --> 2:46:02.120]  you know willfully gave it up and he was going to put me on the list he's like
[2:46:02.120 --> 2:46:05.400]  we need to put you on a list because this blade is more than three inches long
[2:46:05.400 --> 2:46:09.320]  and i said now hold on i i bought this at home depot you know i just carry a
[2:46:09.320 --> 2:46:12.840]  pocket knife and i talked to two supervisors and they let they
[2:46:12.840 --> 2:46:16.200]  eventually let me go but it reminded me of ron manuel saying
[2:46:16.200 --> 2:46:19.480]  you know we're we're going to use a list to know who's you know not going to be
[2:46:19.480 --> 2:46:23.560]  able to buy guns and and that's the one star i was going to tell you no no no
[2:46:23.560 --> 2:46:27.240]  no the england's already met at eight million it's a million here a few
[2:46:27.240 --> 2:46:29.960]  months ago twenty five thousand are added every month
[2:46:29.960 --> 2:46:33.480]  and they said taking a photo in an airport i have ever having a misdemeanor
[2:46:33.480 --> 2:46:36.200]  you're basically going to be on a no fly list but that's going to be under
[2:46:36.200 --> 2:46:39.880]  homeland security a no buy list and just like now if you ever
[2:46:39.880 --> 2:46:41.960]  bounce to check or have an outstanding bill
[2:46:41.960 --> 2:46:45.560]  even if you have a check or even if you have a credit card and it shows it's
[2:46:45.560 --> 2:46:48.360]  working they swipe your driver's license now
[2:46:48.360 --> 2:46:51.480]  at many stores and then they say oh you can't buy anything
[2:46:51.480 --> 2:46:54.840]  now because of this this is what they're going to do
[2:46:54.840 --> 2:46:58.440]  i'll go ahead louie absolutely one more thing you know i'm a physician in
[2:46:58.440 --> 2:47:02.280]  north carolina we just computerized our hospital and
[2:47:02.280 --> 2:47:05.480]  you know the nursing staff is asking patients just like you said the
[2:47:05.480 --> 2:47:08.360]  questions when they check these patients and they go through a detailed
[2:47:08.360 --> 2:47:12.200]  questionnaire and the questions have got increasingly bizarre do you have
[2:47:12.200 --> 2:47:15.160]  firearms uh... do you have enough money
[2:47:15.160 --> 2:47:18.600]  uh... is your husband being mean to you and it all goes into a federal like you
[2:47:18.600 --> 2:47:22.280]  said yes thank you alex thank you so much for having me on
[2:47:22.280 --> 2:47:25.400]  well no no hold on tell folks since you're a physician in a hospital what
[2:47:25.400 --> 2:47:28.200]  they're doing this is a federal snooping arm
[2:47:28.200 --> 2:47:31.000]  you're basically in a star chamber than your your for your wife sitting there
[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:34.840]  pregnant they've got a computer it's going into the local health department
[2:47:34.840 --> 2:47:37.560]  that's federalized and then they'll eat they'll ask the
[2:47:37.560 --> 2:47:41.640]  husband to leave now and then say is everything okay at home
[2:47:41.640 --> 2:47:44.840]  and again then they then you wonder why they kidnapped your kids but but go
[2:47:44.840 --> 2:47:48.600]  ahead alex they ask all the questions without any family there you're
[2:47:48.600 --> 2:47:51.880]  absolutely right to ask all these questions before the family is
[2:47:51.880 --> 2:47:56.840]  allowed to come back most of the time and yes they asked and in fact
[2:47:56.840 --> 2:48:00.440]  it was just after i heard your show when you were talking about this but i
[2:48:00.440 --> 2:48:03.240]  just happened to be in there because honestly i'm not usually in the room
[2:48:03.240 --> 2:48:05.960]  when they do this because the nursing staff does it
[2:48:05.960 --> 2:48:08.920]  and i heard these series of questions and they struck me
[2:48:08.920 --> 2:48:12.440]  as very odd and i was like oh jeez that's just what alex was saying you know
[2:48:12.440 --> 2:48:16.360]  three days ago and i said my goodness you know i mean and again it's just all
[2:48:16.360 --> 2:48:20.200]  got computerized and it's going into a database and uh...
[2:48:20.200 --> 2:48:24.280]  it was very unsettling and but this is a perfect example
[2:48:24.280 --> 2:48:28.920]  yeah you're a physician you're not aware of it it's only compartmentalized
[2:48:28.920 --> 2:48:33.000]  and it's only one group of nurses that are specially sent
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:37.320]  to off-site training uh... under the human resources
[2:48:37.320 --> 2:48:41.320]  under the welfare clause they did they went to training for two months
[2:48:41.320 --> 2:48:45.960]  yes yeah let's see there but let's see you watch the nurses and i've cornered
[2:48:45.960 --> 2:48:50.120]  them and i have discussions with them and i go i know about your training
[2:48:50.120 --> 2:48:52.840]  and but i should do this as we're checking out leaving the hospital
[2:48:52.840 --> 2:48:55.880]  because i know they'll you know try to you know claim i'm a terrorist or
[2:48:55.880 --> 2:48:58.520]  something for even knowing this i'm serious but i'm not joking about any
[2:48:58.520 --> 2:49:01.400]  of this and they're on a personal power trip you watch the nurses
[2:49:01.400 --> 2:49:05.080]  hey hunt we take this file downstairs and they're looking at you
[2:49:05.080 --> 2:49:09.000]  it's this it's the secret police and i'm like oh sure i wink at my wife because
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:11.480]  you know i knew about it we had our first child uh...
[2:49:11.480 --> 2:49:15.160]  you know uh... six six and a half years ago and i'll link and i'll even play
[2:49:15.160 --> 2:49:18.680]  along with the petty power trip as i'm deciding to use a hospital because it's
[2:49:18.680 --> 2:49:21.320]  overall safer you know i know we will probably be
[2:49:21.320 --> 2:49:24.120]  driven into our house soon to have children we have anymore
[2:49:24.120 --> 2:49:27.000]  because it's gotten sore well in but we're just you know just under the
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:29.560]  radar with their operatives met let them feel powerful
[2:49:29.560 --> 2:49:33.480]  we're fully aware of their intel operation and uh... you know i i wink and
[2:49:33.480 --> 2:49:36.600]  go downstairs bring the file it's all set up in scripted and then before i'm
[2:49:36.600 --> 2:49:40.440]  leaving them i'll walk in see the same nurse they go i just want you know i
[2:49:40.440 --> 2:49:43.240]  know about all the training and how they got you on a power trip and how you
[2:49:43.240 --> 2:49:47.320]  even get side money uh... when you make stuff up about people
[2:49:47.320 --> 2:49:50.200]  and i said what you're doing is evil and you're going to go to hell for it
[2:49:50.200 --> 2:49:52.920]  and she's like how do you know this information but see
[2:49:52.920 --> 2:49:56.760]  this is the level that we have entered
[2:49:56.760 --> 2:50:00.760]  and the public has no idea it's like when i tell people 12 years ago because i
[2:50:00.760 --> 2:50:03.880]  have government documents that blood is taken from all babies at birth
[2:50:03.880 --> 2:50:06.200]  it's not for a blood test it's sent to the health department they can do the
[2:50:06.200 --> 2:50:10.040]  blood test there it's put in a international human genome
[2:50:10.040 --> 2:50:13.960]  eugenics database now that was in the austin american statesman
[2:50:13.960 --> 2:50:18.280]  sunday and i think it's in the car i need to bring it in here but the point is
[2:50:18.280 --> 2:50:23.400]  is that folks i'm not making any of this up there's no exaggeration
[2:50:23.400 --> 2:50:28.200]  nothing i make occasional mistakes but generally i underestimate how bad things
[2:50:28.200 --> 2:50:32.680]  are but i'm glad so so let me guess you were wondering about was for real and
[2:50:32.680 --> 2:50:37.240]  then now you've been having experiences that are exactly what i said
[2:50:37.240 --> 2:50:39.880]  is that i could say one more thing and i'll let you go

[2:50:46.520 --> 2:50:50.280]  you know when i talk about serious things with them their eyes are always

[2:54:06.200 --> 2:54:10.440]  all right we're back live i want to get into the chesterfield mall is watching
[2:54:10.440 --> 2:54:14.040]  you now the riverfront times i have a cnn clip we're
[2:54:14.040 --> 2:54:17.400]  going to analyze it because it is pure propaganda
[2:54:17.400 --> 2:54:20.280]  where they try to acclimate you i was watching tv last night and everything
[2:54:20.280 --> 2:54:22.520]  was acclimating people for trips on the streets
[2:54:22.520 --> 2:54:26.440]  how much fun it is to be tasered they were laughing on cnn about the
[2:54:26.440 --> 2:54:31.400]  don't taser mean to bro clip just all and people are in a subconscious mode
[2:54:31.400 --> 2:54:35.080]  being acclimated and accepting all this horrible stuff thousands of studies
[2:54:35.080 --> 2:54:40.440]  about video games violence on tv all of this acclimates you and so
[2:54:40.440 --> 2:54:43.480]  a large portion of the public they do nothing but watch television they don't
[2:54:43.480 --> 2:54:47.080]  talk to their husbands and wives or children they just stare at the screen
[2:54:47.080 --> 2:54:49.640]  they're in a mesmerized state and you're saying doctor that when you're talking
[2:54:49.640 --> 2:54:53.480]  to patients about serious stuff and that's because it is serious
[2:54:53.480 --> 2:54:58.680]  the disassociation engages and they turn to their mommy the glowing tv
[2:54:58.680 --> 2:55:02.040]  and and and and aren't really listening to you is that what you're saying
[2:55:02.040 --> 2:55:06.440]  absolutely and it's not just i mean you know i do like the interviews at times
[2:55:06.440 --> 2:55:10.600]  of patients and it is uh it's astounding to me and you know
[2:55:10.600 --> 2:55:13.800]  honestly alex it was always their degree and it wasn't till i started
[2:55:13.800 --> 2:55:16.840]  listening to you that i truly realized just how
[2:55:16.840 --> 2:55:21.560]  significant it was i mean you can't get them to stay on task with you in fact
[2:55:21.560 --> 2:55:25.560]  i've i've trained myself to completely i mean i don't watch tv anymore since i
[2:55:25.560 --> 2:55:29.880]  started listening to you but yeah i've trained myself to completely
[2:55:29.880 --> 2:55:32.840]  block out well that's why i used to have
[2:55:32.840 --> 2:55:36.040]  yes i used to hear it over my shoulder you know what i mean and
[2:55:36.040 --> 2:55:39.880]  it was pulled into it now i've just trained myself you know to just not
[2:55:39.880 --> 2:55:43.960]  you know just to completely ignore it but yeah there it's almost impossible
[2:55:43.960 --> 2:55:47.800]  and that's why we use films to extricate people
[2:55:47.800 --> 2:55:52.120]  from the matrix you know i mean television itself in the flicker rate
[2:55:52.120 --> 2:55:54.600]  and everything's a very dangerous medium but we use it
[2:55:54.600 --> 2:55:58.280]  in it it's like the red pill you know they're in their little mind control
[2:55:58.280 --> 2:56:02.520]  tank and we give them the dvd it's the red pill we go okay it's your choice if
[2:56:02.520 --> 2:56:06.280]  you want to see this and then that they get upset at first they're like whoa
[2:56:06.280 --> 2:56:09.800]  i'm i'm in a matrix you know i'm in this control grid
[2:56:09.800 --> 2:56:13.240]  uh you know literally being programmed because i mean it's a digital
[2:56:13.240 --> 2:56:17.320]  interface your eyes or brain stems that you know grow out during the embryonic
[2:56:17.320 --> 2:56:20.360]  development you're staring at a television you're interfacing
[2:56:20.360 --> 2:56:24.120]  with it and then you go into a subconscious mode and no matter how
[2:56:24.120 --> 2:56:28.120]  aware you are consciously you're being programmed and none of us are above it
[2:56:28.120 --> 2:56:32.200]  and so you know i tell people digital media video is very dangerous
[2:56:32.200 --> 2:56:35.880]  it's only red pills you know i tell people stop watching television just
[2:56:35.880 --> 2:56:39.960]  just just give red pills to mind slaves and literally we're giving
[2:56:39.960 --> 2:56:42.680]  people red pills when the obama deception ships out
[2:56:42.680 --> 2:56:46.920]  that's like giant crates of red pills and it's up to you guys to go
[2:56:46.920 --> 2:56:51.080]  okay do you want the red pill because this is the red pill and this is going
[2:56:51.080 --> 2:56:56.120]  to change your life uh and doctor it's good to hear from you
[2:56:56.120 --> 2:57:00.360]  call back again okay uh let's go ahead and start this little
[2:57:00.360 --> 2:57:04.120]  CNN clip uh right now then i'm going to stop it and analyze it as it goes here
[2:57:04.120 --> 2:57:06.440]  it is
[2:57:09.240 --> 2:57:13.800]  it talks flashes colors and must shop sales across the screen
[2:57:13.800 --> 2:57:17.240]  all in an attempt to catch your eye when they tend to look
[2:57:17.240 --> 2:57:20.200]  you know look at the screen and it's about eight to ten seconds but now in
[2:57:20.200 --> 2:57:23.000]  chesterfield the ads are looking right back at you the
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:27.080]  chesterfield mall is one of three in the country testing out a new software
[2:57:27.080 --> 2:57:31.080]  from a company called true media it works by putting a small camera
[2:57:31.080 --> 2:57:35.960]  inside the digital ad it has facial recognition so it takes the
[2:57:35.960 --> 2:57:39.400]  the middle part of your face and kind of the bone structure the eyes
[2:57:39.400 --> 2:57:44.280]  nose and mouth that area and it analyzes it giving advertisers valuable
[2:57:44.280 --> 2:57:46.600]  information about who's watching their ads
[2:57:46.600 --> 2:57:51.160]  the cameras will be able to tell how many people walk by the ads
[2:57:51.160 --> 2:57:56.040]  how many people stop to look and to some degree they may be able to determine
[2:57:56.040 --> 2:57:59.160]  the age sex and ethnicity of the shopper
[2:57:59.160 --> 2:58:02.680]  true media has already developed technology to use that information
[2:58:02.680 --> 2:58:07.240]  to cater the ads to a specific shopper but the ad company ad space
[2:58:07.240 --> 2:58:11.160]  says that's not the goal it's just not practical for us
[2:58:11.160 --> 2:58:15.000]  to tailor it to a given person looking at the screen because
[2:58:15.000 --> 2:58:26.920]  um there are a lot of them and uh we

[3:00:22.440 --> 3:00:26.040]  real government documents the psych warfare it's very sophisticated
[3:00:26.040 --> 3:00:30.280]  very dangerous and it ensnares those that designed it as well
[3:00:30.280 --> 3:00:34.120]  none of us are immune those of you that serve this evil are being destroyed by
[3:00:34.120 --> 3:00:38.440]  the blowback of the devastating weapons you're using against society
[3:00:38.440 --> 3:00:42.840]  you know it and i know it we all know it
[3:00:42.840 --> 3:00:46.840]  i uh told people 12 years ago that they were taking blood from all americans
[3:00:46.840 --> 3:00:50.760]  and anyone in the western world at birth for a eugenics grand database out of
[3:00:50.760 --> 3:00:54.440]  the government documents austin americans statesman texans unknowingly

[3:01:00.040 --> 3:01:03.320]  ethicists say parents should be asked for consent before newborn screening
[3:01:03.320 --> 3:01:06.120]  samples are kept what do you think the austin police chief is doing where he says
[3:01:06.120 --> 3:01:08.200]  he's going to take your blood for misdemeanors
[3:01:08.200 --> 3:01:11.320]  they don't ask for babies they're not going to ask for you and this goes into

[3:01:14.440 --> 3:01:17.400]  press international texans using infant blood for research
[3:01:17.400 --> 3:01:20.280]  you're only hearing about this here in texas because i've been putting it out
[3:01:20.280 --> 3:01:22.600]  every week on the radio here and pointing out the
[3:01:22.600 --> 3:01:26.920]  university of texas uh at san antonio is the grand database for all the united
[3:01:26.920 --> 3:01:30.520]  states it's under un control under the unesco
[3:01:30.520 --> 3:01:35.160]  and the major eugenics operations all right finishing up with this c and n
[3:01:35.160 --> 3:01:38.680]  piece we're analyzing notice they say yeah we can identify who you are but
[3:01:38.680 --> 3:01:42.600]  we're not doing that right now uh but we do know your age and race and
[3:01:42.600 --> 3:01:46.280]  things like that and what you're you know wearing and we tailor adds to you
[3:01:46.280 --> 3:01:49.720]  oh it sees all that's a black guy looks like about 45 the computer note it's
[3:01:49.720 --> 3:01:52.360]  the fence department this is already on the street corners too they're just
[3:01:52.360 --> 3:01:56.680]  letting you know through the shopping and they also have a lot of closed places
[3:01:56.680 --> 3:02:00.440]  you go in now and it scans your body for the best fit for customs clothes that's
[3:02:00.440 --> 3:02:04.920]  given to the feds uh when you go in the airport screeners now 200 plus airports
[3:02:04.920 --> 3:02:08.840]  have got a body scanner scans your naked body that gives them a biometric 360
[3:02:08.840 --> 3:02:13.400]  for look down uh surveillance blimps and satellites so they can
[3:02:13.400 --> 3:02:18.280]  even through fog or clouds with infrared get your biometric walk from above
[3:02:18.280 --> 3:02:21.240]  with 100 accuracy the us is already under full
[3:02:21.240 --> 3:02:25.560]  spectral domination with that that's the secret weapon that
[3:02:25.560 --> 3:02:30.360]  that uh a few months ago bob woman was writing about they're using an iraq
[3:02:30.360 --> 3:02:36.520]  and so they use uh the the the the driver's license digital photo that the feds
[3:02:36.520 --> 3:02:42.120]  set up under federalization in 93 to interface it with the face scanners
[3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:45.720]  so i told you when you saw my nori report that's what they're really doing
[3:02:45.720 --> 3:02:49.560]  and this is all fact i i you know but keep trying to warn people this is a
[3:02:49.560 --> 3:02:54.120]  scientific murder grid this is all a pentagon control grid
[3:02:54.120 --> 3:02:57.080]  and once they get it in place they're gonna have controlled bioweapons releases
[3:02:57.080 --> 3:03:00.680]  and kill the majority of us according to their own admissions and just when
[3:03:00.680 --> 3:03:03.960]  you're dying at least know they did it okay when your whole town's flopping
[3:03:03.960 --> 3:03:07.800]  around vomiting their guts out you know crapping their their guts out
[3:03:07.800 --> 3:03:11.240]  just remember i tried to warn you uh okay let's go ahead and finish the club
[3:03:11.240 --> 3:03:16.760]  here it is and to some degree they may be able to determine the age sex and
[3:03:16.760 --> 3:03:21.080]  ethnicity of the shopper true media has already developed technology to use
[3:03:21.080 --> 3:03:23.880]  that information to cater the ads to a specific
[3:03:23.880 --> 3:03:28.360]  shopper but the ad company ad space says that's not the goal
[3:03:28.360 --> 3:03:33.160]  it's just not practical for us to tailor it to a given person looking at the
[3:03:33.160 --> 3:03:36.840]  screen because um there are a lot of them
[3:03:36.840 --> 3:03:40.760]  and uh we wouldn't really be able to decide who to tailor it to
[3:03:40.760 --> 3:03:44.760]  still some shoppers say the technology is to 1984
[3:03:44.760 --> 3:03:47.720]  they don't want big brother knowing when and where they shop
[3:03:47.720 --> 3:03:51.240]  well we've actually had people who talk about it being the the movie collateral
[3:03:51.240 --> 3:03:54.760]  that tom cruise you know when he walked in the uh store and they had rested by
[3:03:54.760 --> 3:03:58.360]  name it's nowhere near that because what we are doing
[3:03:58.360 --> 3:04:04.360]  is anonymously this is only the beginning plan on seeing these ads pop up at
[3:04:04.360 --> 3:04:07.800]  malls across the country
[3:04:07.800 --> 3:04:11.480]  all right total propaganda and again by they want to kill you that's the u
[3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:15.080]  genesis the global it's not these little mindless front companies
[3:04:15.080 --> 3:04:18.360]  most of them are compartmentalized just like that doctor you know right there
[3:04:18.360 --> 3:04:21.240]  while they're putting everything in the federal database spying on your family
[3:04:21.240 --> 3:04:25.480]  when you're at the hospital now
[3:04:25.480 --> 3:04:28.840]  we have to protest this we have to say no i remember when h e b was putting
[3:04:28.840 --> 3:04:31.000]  thumb scanners in in houston it was on the news
[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:34.360]  it's not a thumb print it's a group of numbers well yeah
[3:04:34.360 --> 3:04:37.560]  they turn the thumb print into a group of numbers so they can transmit it and
[3:04:37.560 --> 3:04:41.480]  control it and check the database was reconfigured in that digital algorithm
[3:04:41.480 --> 3:04:46.120]  of the thumb print to buy and sell so they play a lot of games with this oh
[3:04:46.120 --> 3:04:48.760]  don't worry we're not tracking you with this we're just
[3:04:48.760 --> 3:04:52.440]  face scanning you everything's fine we love you
[3:04:52.440 --> 3:05:02.440]  please thumb print to buy and sell we'll be right back

[3:09:02.520 --> 3:09:05.960]  i don't really agree with john carpenter's messages he's claiming that
[3:09:05.960 --> 3:09:08.680]  the globalists want us to marry and reproduce they actually don't want
[3:09:08.680 --> 3:09:15.480]  that the black people were the main commodity of slaves

[3:10:38.840 --> 3:10:42.440]  stuff to try to demonize me discredit me but the information is true it doesn't
[3:10:42.440 --> 3:10:45.240]  matter because it's not about alex jones
[3:10:45.240 --> 3:10:50.920]  um let's go ahead and uh go to ted anderson for a few minutes and i'm
[3:10:50.920 --> 3:10:56.040]  going right to your calls i know collie and carrie and nick and
[3:10:56.040 --> 3:10:58.760]  marty and steven others have been patiently holding
[3:10:58.760 --> 3:11:01.480]  and that we're going to get to you in just a moment but i wanted to bring up
[3:11:01.480 --> 3:11:04.360]  ted anderson here for just a few minutes i'm not going to spend a lot of time on
[3:11:04.360 --> 3:11:07.400]  this gold shot up over a thousand it went back down
[3:11:07.400 --> 3:11:12.520]  ten bucks went back up again the stock market's plunging as we speak
[3:11:12.520 --> 3:11:18.200]  and um ted anderson's the owner of the gc and radio network he also owns minus
[3:11:18.200 --> 3:11:21.880]  resources has been in gold and silver trader for 30 years minus has been around
[3:11:21.880 --> 3:11:25.000]  i think 14 and they're just fabulous folks these
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:28.520]  were my first big sponsor when i first got syndicated and then they took over
[3:11:28.520 --> 3:11:32.360]  the little network i was on they bought it or bought some of the equipment and
[3:11:32.360 --> 3:11:36.280]  set one up themselves and uh ted's just a great guy and i have to
[3:11:36.280 --> 3:11:38.920]  know the gold and silver business now after all these years
[3:11:38.920 --> 3:11:42.680]  after almost 14 years dealing with it and 12 plus years dealing with ted i
[3:11:42.680 --> 3:11:45.560]  guess 13 with ted even when it was just a sponsor
[3:11:45.560 --> 3:11:50.440]  uh but there he bought gold and silver and when it was when gold was under
[3:11:50.440 --> 3:11:54.680]  a hundred dollars you know less than it is now per ounce and silver when it was
[3:11:54.680 --> 3:11:58.360]  five dollars less than it is announced right now and he still has the very
[3:11:58.360 --> 3:12:01.880]  tail end of some of that a few of the other things he ran out of
[3:12:01.880 --> 3:12:05.080]  he did get some more of those sovereigns and uh things
[3:12:05.080 --> 3:12:09.560]  and they only went up a little bit uh because you already had a position
[3:12:09.560 --> 3:12:11.800]  earlier when it was still lower but it's not
[3:12:11.800 --> 3:12:16.520]  you know the deal that we had last week uh so so just briefly ted explain
[3:12:16.520 --> 3:12:19.080]  exactly what you've got to offer the folks today
[3:12:19.080 --> 3:12:23.720]  yeah okay i mean we do have the frank said 223 which is only
[3:12:23.720 --> 3:12:28.360]  well 221 last friday so i was i was able to hold it to just a
[3:12:28.360 --> 3:12:32.040]  a couple of dollars increase and the british sovereign
[3:12:32.040 --> 3:12:35.640]  where we just got high enough for so i could offer my next position
[3:12:35.640 --> 3:12:40.280]  which are at 279 and and they were just uh you know they were just a little bit
[3:12:40.280 --> 3:12:44.280]  lower than that before um you know i it's a big battle in the
[3:12:44.280 --> 3:12:48.600]  gold and silver business right now uh the futures market the sellers the
[3:12:48.600 --> 3:12:53.080]  short sellers are trying to push the gold down low the the buyers the
[3:12:53.080 --> 3:12:57.080]  long buyers are trying to push the gold up the buyers right now are winning
[3:12:57.080 --> 3:12:59.880]  over the sellers i mean alex i thought i was going to have an
[3:12:59.880 --> 3:13:03.800]  opportunity here to buy a fairly good position because we hit
[3:13:03.800 --> 3:13:08.360]  about 974 today and i was able to get a few things that didn't
[3:13:08.360 --> 3:13:12.040]  stay down there long enough uh it now it's up two dollars and
[3:13:12.040 --> 3:13:16.680]  30 cents from the open at 996.50 and the bit has been as high as
[3:13:16.680 --> 3:13:20.760]  999.10 uh i can tell you right now i i'm hoping
[3:13:20.760 --> 3:13:24.040]  that the central banks will come in here and push a little harder on the
[3:13:24.040 --> 3:13:26.760]  downside because they're trying to protect their
[3:13:26.760 --> 3:13:31.480]  their precious fiat currency but they're they're losing the battle i mean i
[3:13:31.480 --> 3:13:34.760]  i look at every one of these opportunities when they're manipulating
[3:13:34.760 --> 3:13:38.840]  the marketplace down i'm like trying to buy as much as i can because i know
[3:13:38.840 --> 3:13:42.520]  it's just going to bounce back again and i didn't hardly even have a shot at it
[3:13:42.520 --> 3:13:46.280]  this time it went so fast but uh yeah you're right i mean the
[3:13:46.280 --> 3:13:49.800]  the things that i have right now are the british sovereign the uh the francs
[3:13:49.800 --> 3:13:53.480]  i was able to pick up a few more 20 gold pieces i have a really good buy on
[3:13:53.480 --> 3:13:57.720]  those right now but small quantity the best thing that i have right now
[3:13:57.720 --> 3:14:00.760]  uh because it's the same price as it was last friday
[3:14:00.760 --> 3:14:06.120]  is the walking liberty uh halves at 869 and the dimes right now at a buck
[3:14:06.120 --> 3:14:10.360]  59 uh silver did not take the drop like gold did
[3:14:10.360 --> 3:14:14.920]  so what you have what you have at last weeks and same prices is the silver
[3:14:14.920 --> 3:14:18.040]  uh that the silver half dollars in the dimes the best deal out there folks
[3:14:18.040 --> 3:14:22.040]  your dad bought this at the 950 level and it went up to almost 15
[3:14:22.040 --> 3:14:25.880]  and it's still right there so you cannot beat the deal on the silver how long
[3:14:25.880 --> 3:14:29.320]  till that silver runs out to well you know it's the supplies are
[3:14:29.320 --> 3:14:34.520]  definitely getting short i mean i i picked up i can't remember 20 25 bags i
[3:14:34.520 --> 3:14:37.640]  mono would be able to tell me i mean it was a pretty good position
[3:14:37.640 --> 3:14:43.720]  uh but right now we're sitting here at uh 1466 on the silver on today's peak
[3:14:43.720 --> 3:14:48.200]  currently trading right now at 1450 that's almost a 50 percent increase up
[3:14:48.200 --> 3:14:51.000]  from that nine to ten dollar range where it was
[3:14:51.000 --> 3:14:56.040]  uh yeah i mean what other investment yeah i had a tv crew here asking me alex
[3:14:56.040 --> 3:14:59.560]  why do you say invest in gold and i said why
[3:14:59.560 --> 3:15:03.880]  five years ago what was it to you know 80 an ounce and now it's at a thousand why
[3:15:03.880 --> 3:15:06.280]  well what else is performing like this i mean
[3:15:06.280 --> 3:15:09.320]  you know i'm not saying telling folks when to hold it or when to sell it but
[3:15:09.320 --> 3:15:12.680]  you know we've been proven right all along the globalists can manipulate it
[3:15:12.680 --> 3:15:15.480]  sometimes for a while but it's still you look at the graph it's going straight
[3:15:15.480 --> 3:15:19.240]  up well here's here's one for you alex i mean if you put a hundred thousand
[3:15:19.240 --> 3:15:22.520]  dollars into the dow jones industrial average
[3:15:22.520 --> 3:15:25.960]  in september of last year right now it'd be worth 64
[3:15:25.960 --> 3:15:30.040]  thousand 43 if you put a hundred thousand dollars into gold
[3:15:30.040 --> 3:15:36.920]  september last year your position now would be worth 134 thousand 297 and
[3:15:36.920 --> 3:15:41.240]  16 cents which one do you think is better a 34 thousand dollar
[3:15:41.240 --> 3:15:47.160]  profit or a 35 thousand plus dollar loss i don't know i think i'll be in the
[3:15:47.160 --> 3:15:50.600]  stock market ten yeah well i think i want to lose i think i want to lose
[3:15:50.600 --> 3:15:54.840]  35 percent in a few months i i think you may be with al-qaeda sure
[3:15:54.840 --> 3:16:00.680]  well we're right now at 72 44 13 on the dow it's down 121 points
[3:16:00.680 --> 3:16:04.600]  and uh and i i happen to think that bob Chapman might be right on this one
[3:16:04.600 --> 3:16:08.600]  because it's been right for the last what 20 years
[3:16:08.600 --> 3:16:11.800]  uh right now he's looking for that dow to drop below
[3:16:11.800 --> 3:16:15.480]  seven thousand and even break through the six thousand dollar range
[3:16:15.480 --> 3:16:19.080]  yeah yeah he said in late february or early march it would drop below seven
[3:16:19.080 --> 3:16:22.440]  thousand he said that back during the bailout five
[3:16:22.440 --> 3:16:25.400]  months ago this guy's incredible um that's why he's so
[3:16:25.400 --> 3:16:31.080]  successful 800 686 2237 800 686 2237
[3:16:31.080 --> 3:16:34.680]  ted's gonna hold this deal until tonight uh again
[3:16:34.680 --> 3:16:38.920]  uh ted what's the position on the gold you've got is that it was that it's
[3:16:38.920 --> 3:16:42.440]  that that's just the oh the price wise i mean i can't remember what the spot was
[3:16:42.440 --> 3:16:45.960]  it was eight but i mean i mean you're pricing it at what 880 890 an ounce
[3:16:45.960 --> 3:16:49.240]  yeah right exactly it's that i mean i keep on buying positions on the
[3:16:49.240 --> 3:16:52.760]  dip and that's about the price range that that stuff was in at that time
[3:16:52.760 --> 3:16:57.560]  i have people call me up well that's not spot you nobody can buy coins at spot
[3:16:57.560 --> 3:17:00.840]  but when it goes down i can get the coins that are available in the marketplace
[3:17:00.840 --> 3:17:05.080]  at at that time at a better price and it's been bouncing back up again
[3:17:05.080 --> 3:17:08.520]  it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that you gotta buy it
[3:17:08.520 --> 3:17:13.160]  ted has got the best deals out there period because he buys uh when it's low
[3:17:13.160 --> 3:17:16.120]  and sells it to you at the low price when it goes up instead of what everybody
[3:17:16.120 --> 3:17:21.720]  else does selling it at the high price when it goes up 800 686 2237
[3:17:21.720 --> 3:17:27.480]  and the brokers will be there until midnight central standard time 800 686 2237
[3:17:27.480 --> 3:17:31.160]  take advantage of this and the silver deal is just too good to be true but it
[3:17:31.160 --> 3:17:35.400]  is true 800 686 2237 thank you ted
[3:17:35.400 --> 3:17:38.520]  thanks for having me up alex you bet i'm gonna take your calls now as quickly as
[3:17:38.520 --> 3:17:41.160]  possible a lot of other news and things i need to get to but let's go to your
[3:17:41.160 --> 3:17:45.160]  calls i appreciate you holding uh collie in arkansas you're on the air
[3:17:45.160 --> 3:17:50.200]  welcome hey what's up alex man this this is exciting right now
[3:17:50.200 --> 3:17:53.640]  i just gotta say we're living in exciting times cuz
[3:17:53.640 --> 3:17:57.880]  i mean i'm really seeing the power slipping away
[3:17:57.880 --> 3:18:01.960]  from the power structure and back to the people like i really see no way that
[3:18:01.960 --> 3:18:04.600]  they're gonna be able to win this but you have to understand they're like
[3:18:04.600 --> 3:18:09.000]  judo they create the crisis we lunge at them they use our energy
[3:18:09.000 --> 3:18:13.080]  against us so you need to understand here that yes it's an opportunity for us
[3:18:13.080 --> 3:18:17.800]  it's also an opportunity for them so we're very serious but yes we've got
[3:18:17.800 --> 3:18:21.080]  a fighting chance if people go absolutely ape
[3:18:21.080 --> 3:18:25.000]  yeah well i'm just saying i'm i'm tired of being scared
[3:18:25.000 --> 3:18:28.840]  you know i'm tired of having people with their head in the fan
[3:18:28.840 --> 3:18:34.040]  you know i mean i think uh i think we've got a fighting chance here because
[3:18:34.040 --> 3:18:38.040]  you know with with the implosion you know that they're they're creating
[3:18:38.040 --> 3:18:41.640]  like you always say problem reaction solution
[3:18:41.640 --> 3:18:45.400]  they're creating the problem if if everyone can find out
[3:18:45.400 --> 3:18:48.840]  where the problem is coming from we can deny the solution
[3:18:48.840 --> 3:18:53.480]  you know that that seems to be the key to it
[3:18:53.480 --> 3:18:56.840]  well i agree with you i mean they are the criminals that did this it's on record
[3:18:56.840 --> 3:19:00.520]  why are they posing as the saviors saying give us more power give us more
[3:19:00.520 --> 3:19:04.120]  control exactly i and something else that encouraged me i was
[3:19:04.120 --> 3:19:08.280]  watching glenn beck the other day and uh he had a cia guy and a military guy on
[3:19:08.280 --> 3:19:11.000]  they were kind of war gaming what would happen in the u.s. you know
[3:19:11.000 --> 3:19:17.160]  this civil unrest happened and you know they were talking about all that but
[3:19:17.160 --> 3:19:21.240]  basically glenn beck kind of asked the cia guy you know well
[3:19:21.240 --> 3:19:24.840]  how do you how do you keep the bubble effect from happening and how do you
[3:19:24.840 --> 3:19:28.920]  keep you know the the control with with the government and he said i'm not
[3:19:28.920 --> 3:19:32.360]  really you know for the government but how would the government do that and
[3:19:32.360 --> 3:19:38.040]  cia guy kind of was just like well you just let it happen
[3:19:38.040 --> 3:19:41.720]  and and and it was kind of a weird moment glenn like i have
[3:19:41.720 --> 3:19:46.120]  what really what are you doing you know what i saw that clip

[3:19:50.360 --> 3:19:54.520]  it up on info wars dot com yeah oh yeah because the cia guys are losing
[3:19:54.520 --> 3:19:57.320]  all their pension funds too and they're going

[3:22:02.360 --> 3:22:05.960]  as many people know ever since president nixon took us off the gold standard
[3:22:05.960 --> 3:22:09.640]  the u.s. dollar has been evaluating what people don't know however is how this
[3:22:09.640 --> 3:22:12.760]  directly affects your personal finances is there a way to prevent your
[3:22:12.760 --> 3:22:16.600]  portfolios from losing value the answer to all of this is gold and silver
[3:22:16.600 --> 3:22:19.960]  they've both maintained their purchasing power for six thousand years
[3:22:19.960 --> 3:22:23.560]  if you had had one hundred thousand dollars in cash and one hundred thousand

[3:26:03.480 --> 3:26:08.440]  good sir uh i'd like to talk about uh recently uh obama came to canada back
[3:26:08.440 --> 3:26:11.240]  on the 19th down friday i think it was anyway
[3:26:11.240 --> 3:26:16.840]  um turn on the one main news channel here in cbc one of them anyway cbc
[3:26:16.840 --> 3:26:21.320]  uh to an hour long special all about obama's visit to canada
[3:26:21.320 --> 3:26:24.120]  had the kids you know telling the cameras how they didn't go to school
[3:26:24.120 --> 3:26:27.240]  because you know obama and he's cool and all that
[3:26:27.240 --> 3:26:31.880]  um and i just wanted to mention one quote um if i could from the toronto
[3:26:31.880 --> 3:26:36.680]  star you can google it um i'll bear with me one second
[3:26:36.680 --> 3:26:40.600]  well he's our savior or something oh no not not exactly um
[3:26:40.600 --> 3:26:44.440]  um the newscaster man's bridge asked him uh
[3:26:44.440 --> 3:26:47.640]  what is your sense of the country about canada and obama replied
[3:26:47.640 --> 3:26:52.120]  eventually quote i think canada has shown itself to be a pretty good manager
[3:26:52.120 --> 3:26:56.440]  of the financial system in the economy in ways that we haven't always seen here
[3:26:56.440 --> 3:27:00.680]  in the united states and i think that's important for us to take note of
[3:27:00.680 --> 3:27:05.080]  that it's just uh possible for us to have a vibrant vibrant banking sector for
[3:27:05.080 --> 3:27:08.360]  example without taking some of the wild risks that have
[3:27:08.360 --> 3:27:13.160]  resulted in so much trouble on wall street and i think that's just uh
[3:27:13.160 --> 3:27:16.200]  important because you always say canada is kind of deeper
[3:27:16.200 --> 3:27:19.800]  into the new world order like we're more asleep
[3:27:19.800 --> 3:27:24.360]  one main channel that sort of thing like your point on that
[3:27:24.360 --> 3:27:27.880]  well i mean he's also always implying he's going to stop the reckless stuff on
[3:27:27.880 --> 3:27:31.640]  wall street when he was put in power by these people i appreciate your call

[3:28:05.560 --> 3:28:09.800]  anything from them that isn't skewed towards
[3:28:09.800 --> 3:28:16.120]  liberal politics democrat politics and they like make it into a sport where
[3:28:16.120 --> 3:28:20.520]  it's the democrats against the republicans and and i i watch this and
[3:28:20.520 --> 3:28:24.200]  it spreads throughout the the community door
[3:28:24.200 --> 3:28:28.280]  it's like you see pink elephants if you want to denounce the
[3:28:28.280 --> 3:28:31.400]  obama what they don't understand is that a lot of us

[3:28:47.400 --> 3:28:51.400]  right now i listened to alan keys and then i listened to keith oberman
[3:28:51.400 --> 3:28:56.040]  and his uh... his legal person telling him

[3:33:15.160 --> 3:33:18.360]  back clips we're talking about martial law police state how does the government
[3:33:18.360 --> 3:33:21.480]  control the babas now remember glenbeck did these
[3:33:21.480 --> 3:33:24.040]  series of programs a year ago and ron paul looked like he could win the
[3:33:24.040 --> 3:33:27.400]  republican nomination so we need to use the military against these ron paul
[3:33:27.400 --> 3:33:31.640]  people they're dangerous uh they're bad
[3:33:31.640 --> 3:33:35.320]  and on and on now though they realize the whole public's waking up to him so
[3:33:35.320 --> 3:33:39.720]  he's on fox and it's like alex jones has a tv show but but but still he says oh
[3:33:39.720 --> 3:33:43.160]  what do we do about the babas and then the cia guys including mr bear we've
[3:33:43.160 --> 3:33:46.120]  interviewed her say oh you know maybe we should just let the boba effect take
[3:33:46.120 --> 3:33:49.320]  place look the foreign banks are taking over
[3:33:49.320 --> 3:33:51.560]  this country there's a lot of people in the system
[3:33:51.560 --> 3:33:54.280]  suddenly we have a zignin brzezinski coming out and saying i'm afraid the
[3:33:54.280 --> 3:33:56.280]  public's going to revolt against the bankers
[3:33:56.280 --> 3:34:00.040]  and arrest people as if he's not with them and we see that from beck and the
[3:34:00.040 --> 3:34:03.160]  rest of them i think there's a lot of different scenarios here but they're
[3:34:03.160 --> 3:34:05.640]  acting like they're scared and they realize
[3:34:05.640 --> 3:34:09.400]  that obama isn't going to work it's not the con jobs not going to work
[3:34:09.400 --> 3:34:12.120]  and they've gone too far they're destroying the economy by design to
[3:34:12.120 --> 3:34:15.000]  bring in the new world order they've announced the new world order people
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:18.040]  aren't buying it the awakening i can't describe it it's just exponential right
[3:34:18.040 --> 3:34:21.320]  now i'm talking to folks out here that have parties and things with you know
[3:34:21.320 --> 3:34:24.280]  mainline dumboes they're all talking about the new world order and the bankers
[3:34:24.280 --> 3:34:26.760]  and the government being evil and fema camps
[3:34:26.760 --> 3:34:31.080]  it's out there it's over for you now it it it's over for you with the cat being
[3:34:31.080 --> 3:34:33.720]  on the bag the question is will the public say no
[3:34:33.720 --> 3:34:37.160]  will we wake up the tv zombies that are still asleep
[3:34:37.160 --> 3:34:40.520]  this is really glenn beck in my opinion he showed himself to be extremely
[3:34:40.520 --> 3:34:44.520]  sneaky and globalist to try to co-op the movement so he can
[3:34:44.520 --> 3:34:48.680]  at key points tell folks to stand down or whatever i don't want the boba effect
[3:34:48.680 --> 3:34:52.040]  to go into play unless they're trying to put us on flat back trucks to take us
[3:34:52.040 --> 3:34:54.680]  to fema camps as the military is openly trying to do
[3:34:54.680 --> 3:34:59.320]  aren't i supposed to have another guest on right now i totally forgot about that

[3:35:32.440 --> 3:35:36.200]  is getting and that's why the establishment is having to put out clones of us
[3:35:36.200 --> 3:35:39.320]  i've been offered national tv shows but they wanted me to water down what i
[3:35:39.320 --> 3:35:43.400]  would do not by fox by others uh that's on record
[3:35:43.400 --> 3:35:47.320]  and so so they really know they can't beat us they're going to join us but try
[3:35:47.320 --> 3:35:50.840]  to put a spin on it and i think beck's doing that now if fox has gotten
[3:35:50.840 --> 3:35:53.560]  religion and isn't globalist but we know they are with murdoch
[3:35:53.560 --> 3:35:59.800]  you know so be it but but just watch this very carefully as we analyze it
[3:35:59.800 --> 3:36:04.040]  yes you can get the situation anywhere this is the war that possibly is coming
[3:36:04.040 --> 3:36:08.840]  to our shores the war room we are war gaming different scenarios we are not
[3:36:08.840 --> 3:36:11.160]  predicting that these things will happen we're
[3:36:11.160 --> 3:36:15.640]  asking could they happen what do we do if they happen
[3:36:15.640 --> 3:36:19.480]  here's our second scenario global civil unrest
[3:36:19.480 --> 3:36:23.320]  now the united states is no longer the world's policeman mexico has been taken
[3:36:23.320 --> 3:36:27.240]  over by narco gangs oil and gas pipelines have been targeted
[3:36:27.240 --> 3:36:31.000]  and destroyed tourism not existent due to safety concerns
[3:36:31.000 --> 3:36:36.120]  ukraine is the first european system uh uh uh country to fail eastern european
[3:36:36.120 --> 3:36:39.320]  ireland is the first western country to fail
[3:36:39.320 --> 3:36:43.320]  50 million people worldwide are unemployed there are riots in the streets
[3:36:43.320 --> 3:36:48.840]  joining me now from berkeley california is former cia operative bob bear
[3:36:48.840 --> 3:36:53.320]  one of the scariest dudes i know and in chicago is department of homeland
[3:36:53.320 --> 3:36:57.800]  securities red cell unit brad thor also author of many best sellers
[3:36:57.800 --> 3:37:00.440]  brad let me start with you because we're going to start with mexico
[3:37:00.440 --> 3:37:03.800]  there's breaking news that just came over the wire just the last couple of
[3:37:03.800 --> 3:37:06.920]  minutes i believe you have that update
[3:37:06.920 --> 3:37:10.680]  i do a lot of war as that their chief law enforcement officer there has now
[3:37:10.680 --> 3:37:14.840]  resigned after what his officers in a prison guard were killed
[3:37:14.840 --> 3:37:17.400]  over the last couple days with notes threatening his family and everything
[3:37:17.400 --> 3:37:20.360]  glennon this is what we talked about last time i was on with you
[3:37:20.360 --> 3:37:23.720]  uh... is that martin mexico is this close to being a failed state and it's
[3:37:23.720 --> 3:37:27.480]  going to be a narco state and this is going to propose serious as we discussed
[3:37:27.480 --> 3:37:31.800]  before serious security concerns for the united states right and it will lead
[3:37:31.800 --> 3:37:35.800]  to uh... i believe it will play into at least the disenfranchisement in the
[3:37:35.800 --> 3:37:40.040]  and and a possible uprising here in the united states with god forbid please
[3:37:40.040 --> 3:37:43.800]  everybody uh... have a seat in and relax just a little bit
[3:37:43.800 --> 3:37:51.000]  um... uh... bob on the world stage what are you most concerned about if
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:56.280]  if these things would come true what what happens to us as we have to
[3:37:56.280 --> 3:38:00.600]  retract back into ourselves because we can't afford to be the world's
[3:38:00.600 --> 3:38:05.720]  policeman what concerns you what does the world look like
[3:38:05.720 --> 3:38:09.400]  here's a couple scenarios that are we getting are becoming very real are
[3:38:09.400 --> 3:38:12.120]  becoming not just risks but probability
[3:38:12.120 --> 3:38:15.720]  let's say we go into a prolonged uh... depression
[3:38:15.720 --> 3:38:20.040]  price of oil fall falls to five or six dollars a barrel the gulf state starts
[3:38:20.040 --> 3:38:22.680]  going under one by one saudi arabia
[3:38:22.680 --> 3:38:28.120]  depends on very expensive oil so does iran iran's got a population of seventy
[3:38:28.120 --> 3:38:32.600]  million uh... people start to starve they're out of money a big army
[3:38:32.600 --> 3:38:36.600]  uh... they move into the gulf and take it we have a hostile regime
[3:38:36.600 --> 3:38:41.000]  in control of our resources that is uh... not that far away
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:45.160]  you know we have uh... uh... i know both of you gentlemen we have talked over
[3:38:45.160 --> 3:38:48.760]  the years about iran getting a nuke and uh... uh...
[3:38:48.760 --> 3:38:51.960]  benjamin neton yahoo is now the guy in charge
[3:38:51.960 --> 3:38:55.480]  and he looked me in the eye and said we have a right
[3:38:55.480 --> 3:39:01.560]  to survive we have a right to live and he was very clear with me that he would
[3:39:01.560 --> 3:39:05.720]  not allow uh... iran to get a nuke they now have the material to make one
[3:39:05.720 --> 3:39:09.480]  how much of a role does that play in in what's coming
[3:39:09.480 --> 3:39:12.440]  glenn i think it's i think it's huge good
[3:39:12.440 --> 3:39:15.160]  go ahead and i think it's gonna be a
[3:39:15.160 --> 3:39:18.800]  i think it's gonna be a big deal especially if this crisis and i have
[3:39:18.800 --> 3:39:22.520]  confidence in america i don't think we're gonna get wiped off the the map
[3:39:22.520 --> 3:39:25.560]  as far as just having to remove ourselves from the world stage
[3:39:25.560 --> 3:39:28.120]  but if that does happen before war gaming that here
[3:39:28.120 --> 3:39:31.800]  israel if your older brother is all of a sudden not at the playground with you
[3:39:31.800 --> 3:39:32.760]  one morning
[3:39:32.760 --> 3:39:36.280]  your younger brother needs to step up and not the biggest kid right in the
[3:39:36.280 --> 3:39:38.040]  teeth if he doesn't want to have problems
[3:39:38.040 --> 3:39:42.600]  and i wouldn't begrudge israel the right to do that for a second
[3:39:42.600 --> 3:39:46.040]  glenn there's a there's a pool at the pentagon right now i talked to a couple
[3:39:46.040 --> 3:39:48.200]  officers last couple days that
[3:39:48.200 --> 3:39:51.560]  what are the chances of a major war in the middle east and they're putting it
[3:39:51.560 --> 3:39:54.760]  fifty five percent with net yahoo's appointment today
[3:39:54.760 --> 3:39:57.720]  what is that what is that what does that do to us bobby i mean
[3:39:57.720 --> 3:40:01.960]  you know it uh... archduke ferdinand was a guy that most people in america never
[3:40:01.960 --> 3:40:03.160]  even heard of
[3:40:03.160 --> 3:40:06.200]  he was gunned down in the streets and all of a sudden we were in world war one
[3:40:06.200 --> 3:40:08.680]  the whole world was at war
[3:40:08.680 --> 3:40:10.600]  and we were there but i thought
[3:40:10.600 --> 3:40:15.880]  i'll tell you the way it goes glenn uh... net yahoo goes into gaza gaza city
[3:40:15.880 --> 3:40:18.760]  uh... he at the same time there's
[3:40:18.760 --> 3:40:21.800]  rockets coming across the border from lebanon
[3:40:21.800 --> 3:40:25.880]  the israelis are obligated to go into demascus hit hamas headquarters there
[3:40:25.880 --> 3:40:27.080]  hit his ball
[3:40:27.080 --> 3:40:30.920]  that will pull in iran there will be retaliation against iran
[3:40:30.920 --> 3:40:34.280]  iran has a couple thousand rockets facing again
[3:40:34.280 --> 3:40:37.160]  this is my bias but facing the oil facilities on the other side of the
[3:40:37.160 --> 3:40:37.880]  gulf
[3:40:37.880 --> 3:40:41.160]  and they have promised i truly believe they will they'll fire the rockets these
[3:40:41.160 --> 3:40:42.360]  oil facilities
[3:40:42.360 --> 3:40:46.040]  and this will all occur within minutes i mean this is this is a risk it's not a
[3:40:46.040 --> 3:40:47.000]  certainty
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:51.240]  but this is the kind of what considerations are going out the pentagon today
[3:40:51.240 --> 3:40:53.080]  does anybody
[3:40:53.080 --> 3:40:57.400]  did anybody and i and this is one of the things that really woke me up and it
[3:40:57.400 --> 3:41:00.040]  was after nine eleven i remember the first time i read it
[3:41:00.040 --> 3:41:02.440]  it was osama bin laden and he said
[3:41:02.440 --> 3:41:06.200]  uh... what i did to russia i will bring to the united states and i thought you
[3:41:06.200 --> 3:41:07.720]  are again s o b
[3:41:07.720 --> 3:41:12.520]  you didn't bring down russia it was it was reagan and the pope and thatcher
[3:41:12.520 --> 3:41:15.640]  and indeed he played a huge role
[3:41:15.640 --> 3:41:20.280]  we all did it was the perfect storm and about five years ago that's
[3:41:20.280 --> 3:41:24.360]  well when i reread it again i went all my gosh
[3:41:24.360 --> 3:41:29.640]  that's what i'm most concerned about is that there are so many of these
[3:41:29.640 --> 3:41:32.920]  these things that they could be huge but also
[3:41:32.920 --> 3:41:36.600]  that's tied into what would happen in the middle east is also tied in
[3:41:36.600 --> 3:41:40.760]  to just running over europe europe itself is teetering
[3:41:40.760 --> 3:41:44.520]  with uh... it muslim extremists as well
[3:41:44.520 --> 3:41:47.960]  how does the world stand without america
[3:41:47.960 --> 3:41:52.120]  standing there and being prepared to deal with it
[3:41:52.120 --> 3:41:55.240]  glenn you know this this is a very important point that you brought up
[3:41:55.240 --> 3:41:58.040]  what happens with america not there is exactly what happens when the teacher
[3:41:58.040 --> 3:42:01.240]  leaves the classroom a lot of these people go wild i'm talking
[3:42:01.240 --> 3:42:04.680]  particular in the muslim world and what you have in western europe in
[3:42:04.680 --> 3:42:08.280]  particular is they are no longer going to be able
[3:42:08.280 --> 3:42:11.880]  to be embarrassed that how we interact with them or how we think about them and
[3:42:11.880 --> 3:42:13.480]  how they deal with the spread over there
[3:42:13.480 --> 3:42:16.600]  they're going to fold like a cheap wallet they already are falling we saw
[3:42:16.600 --> 3:42:18.840]  with uh... here welders where they wouldn't let him in
[3:42:18.840 --> 3:42:21.720]  to speak and he got invited to the house of parliament there
[3:42:21.720 --> 3:42:25.400]  so this is a big problem and bin laden also said that his goal was to cripple
[3:42:25.400 --> 3:42:29.480]  us economically so okay time for that i don't have time to do that there's
[3:42:29.480 --> 3:42:32.200]  even more it look it's all just a bunch of
[3:42:32.200 --> 3:42:36.520]  twisting the united states has funded the drug war to go after cartels aren't
[3:42:36.520 --> 3:42:39.880]  paying their cut that's why mexico is collapsing the bankers
[3:42:39.880 --> 3:42:43.320]  we told you this before we told you when gas was you know oil was a hundred and
[3:42:43.320 --> 3:42:46.440]  forty seven dollars a barrel it was going to go down below fifty and it did
[3:42:46.440 --> 3:42:50.040]  to cripple and cause insurrection rebellion worldwide
[3:42:50.040 --> 3:42:53.080]  and this is world war three this is the new world we're bringing in financial
[3:42:53.080 --> 3:42:55.480]  collapse against the u.s against everybody
[3:42:55.480 --> 3:42:58.200]  and they're busy telling you about the muslim extremists they engineered
[3:42:58.200 --> 3:43:00.040]  back in the eighties are going to get us
[3:43:00.040 --> 3:43:02.680]  if the u.s doesn't continue to be the policeman of the world so the bottom
[3:43:02.680 --> 3:43:06.120]  line is invade the world or all dead
[3:43:06.120 --> 3:43:08.760]  with the rand corporation said three months ago about how they need to start a
[3:43:08.760 --> 3:43:13.480]  giant world war and uh... this is it folks
[3:43:13.480 --> 3:43:17.320]  and uh... you know it's just just pathetic uh... i wanna and i apologize we

[3:44:03.240 --> 3:44:07.240]  calls of protest and apparently a lot of the
[3:44:07.240 --> 3:44:13.000]  calls emanated from from your readers uh... so i was interested i just want

[3:44:37.000 --> 3:44:39.960]  to the takeover police state three total enslavement and you don't believe
[3:44:39.960 --> 3:44:43.560]  alex jones' reporter just watch the troops openly training with role
[3:44:43.560 --> 3:44:47.160]  players screaming i'm an american please don't put me in a camp and interrogating
[3:44:47.160 --> 3:44:48.840]  people and saying where'd you get
[3:44:48.840 --> 3:44:51.960]  uh... the firearms where you from i'm from san francisco
[3:44:51.960 --> 3:44:56.600]  this is clearly for the united states and you know the pentagon has announced
[3:44:56.600 --> 3:44:59.240]  that they're gonna put twenty thousand combat troops on the streets of america
[3:44:59.240 --> 3:45:03.160]  for civil insurrection uh... the army war colleges come out and said they're
[3:45:03.160 --> 3:45:06.440]  preparing to deal with american people for insurrection they said that two
[3:45:06.440 --> 3:45:09.080]  months ago you can lexus nexus that are google it
[3:45:09.080 --> 3:45:11.720]  uh... and uh... you know they said they were going to do these door-to-door
[3:45:11.720 --> 3:45:15.640]  things knock and ask if it's okay if they can look practice setting up roadblocks
[3:45:15.640 --> 3:45:19.400]  walking off the town and we got impressed reports
[3:45:19.400 --> 3:45:24.120]  what i've seen in other drills uh... from the uh... nco
[3:45:24.120 --> 3:45:27.000]  sergeant mike knots would actually be running this
[3:45:27.000 --> 3:45:30.040]  he said what we've always witnessed and what we know is true
[3:45:30.040 --> 3:45:34.040]  then i get uh... lieutenant colonel gregg hapgood on last friday you can
[3:45:34.040 --> 3:45:36.840]  listen to that interview just just google it it's all over the web
[3:45:36.840 --> 3:45:39.960]  uh... and you know alex jones lieutenant colonel gregg hapwood
[3:45:39.960 --> 3:45:44.120]  hapgood and you know it was a different story and then i predicted to my staff i
[3:45:44.120 --> 3:45:45.080]  said
[3:45:45.080 --> 3:45:48.200]  watch they're gonna claim it's canceled and they're gonna claim it scaled back
[3:45:48.200 --> 3:45:49.320]  but they'll go ahead and do it
[3:45:49.320 --> 3:45:52.200]  because i've seen i've been to too many of these and we've got video
[3:45:52.200 --> 3:45:55.480]  of marines walking up with guns in hebron maryland saying
[3:45:55.480 --> 3:45:58.760]  turn your cameras off while they have the neighborhood kids running around
[3:45:58.760 --> 3:46:01.960]  looking for the gun owners in a drill you know in nineteen
[3:46:01.960 --> 3:46:05.640]  ninety-eight and so this has been you know this is when you hear black
[3:46:05.640 --> 3:46:09.240]  helicopter this is citizens who've been under this you know we have
[3:46:09.240 --> 3:46:13.000]  links in our stories uh... that we've written at prisonplanet.com to
[3:46:13.000 --> 3:46:17.000]  mainstream news where where people shot live video thinking
[3:46:17.000 --> 3:46:20.280]  in virginian places in florida they were being invaded
[3:46:20.280 --> 3:46:23.160]  uh... and and so this is part of acclimation
[3:46:23.160 --> 3:46:27.480]  for martial law uh... and it's uh... now on record under the john wonder
[3:46:27.480 --> 3:46:30.680]  defense authorization act and presidential decision directive
[3:46:30.680 --> 3:46:34.680]  fifty one in the new pentagon directives to use regular army troops under
[3:46:34.680 --> 3:46:40.680]  north com against the american people and is it your feeling then that what is
[3:46:40.680 --> 3:46:43.720]  going to happen is that this economic
[3:46:43.720 --> 3:46:46.840]  recession is going to get so bad that there's going to be uh...
[3:46:46.840 --> 3:46:50.520]  we're going to lose control that people are going to be
[3:46:50.520 --> 3:46:55.160]  rioting and that type of thing and that that the military will say that
[3:46:55.160 --> 3:46:57.720]  military force is needed against the people

[3:47:21.880 --> 3:47:24.680]  when congress is co-equal to the presidency
[3:47:24.680 --> 3:47:27.720]  uh... the homeland security committee is not allowed to see that so that's on
[3:47:27.720 --> 3:47:29.400]  record if you'd like to pull that up

[3:54:50.120 --> 3:54:54.120]  you know what going back in closing with the Des Moines register a build
[3:54:54.120 --> 3:54:58.680]  a patrosky uh... sir tell us separately about what's happening with the
[3:54:58.680 --> 3:55:01.320]  with some of the pension funds there in iowa right now
[3:55:01.320 --> 3:55:04.600]  i just have posted a story of this morning that are
[3:55:04.600 --> 3:55:07.480]  the largest public employee pension fund in iowa
[3:55:07.480 --> 3:55:10.760]  announced today that three hundred thirty nine million dollars of its assets
[3:55:10.760 --> 3:55:15.640]  are frozen because of and a federal investigation of a california
[3:55:15.640 --> 3:55:19.400]  based investment management firm uh... so this
[3:55:19.400 --> 3:55:23.160]  it only represents about two percent of their assets but uh...
[3:55:23.160 --> 3:55:26.280]  certainly three hundred thirty nine million dollars that's nothing to to
[3:55:26.280 --> 3:55:30.360]  sneeze at that the uh... national futures association
[3:55:30.360 --> 3:55:33.640]  is uh... has suspended the trading capabilities
[3:55:33.640 --> 3:55:37.320]  to two individuals who are principals in this company
[3:55:37.320 --> 3:55:41.240]  and the company's under investigation by the commodities future trading
[3:55:41.240 --> 3:55:44.360]  commission and the u.s. securities and exchange commission
[3:55:44.360 --> 3:55:47.720]  and i've never seen anything like that happen with our our state public
[3:55:47.720 --> 3:55:51.240]  employees pension fund and the public employees pension fund here it had
[3:55:51.240 --> 3:55:53.720]  about twenty two billion dollars in assets
[3:55:53.720 --> 3:55:58.040]  as of last june as of december thirty one it was like eighteen point three
[3:55:58.040 --> 3:56:01.720]  billion so there's there's a lot of concern about something like like that
[3:56:01.720 --> 3:56:04.920]  and and uh... you know i guess the question that people here are
[3:56:04.920 --> 3:56:08.120]  wondering today is did they run into somebody that was uh...
[3:56:08.120 --> 3:56:12.200]  you know uh... situation like matt offer this uh... one of these other types
