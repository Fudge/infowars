[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:42.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome. It is Tuesday, the 29th day of June, 2010, and we're going to be live on the radio network.
[00:42.000 --> 00:51.000]  And we're going to be live here for the next four hours. We have Birgitta Jones-Dottier, member of the Icelandic Parliament joining us.
[00:51.000 --> 01:07.000]  She is the spokesperson now for WikiLeaks. And the founder of WikiLeaks has been in hiding for the last month with MSNBC reporting that there may be hit teams out there trying to kill him.
[01:07.000 --> 01:18.000]  The Pentagon admits they do have a worldwide manhunt out for him. And there's been new information out from this gentleman today through Birgitta Jones-Dottier.
[01:18.000 --> 01:29.000]  So you can bet the government operatives, the Spooks, are going to be listening today. New information from him is going to stay under deep cover that they are after him big time.
[01:29.000 --> 01:41.000]  And, of course, Daniel Ellsberg of the Pentagon Papers has also reported that he had a hit team that's been declassified trying to hunt him down and kill him right after he leaked some of the information because he had more.
[01:41.000 --> 01:56.000]  So this is going to be a very informative update with Birgitta Jones-Dottier joining us with new developments, and I'll be able to squeeze as much info as I can out of her because we're all extremely interested in this case.
[01:56.000 --> 02:17.000]  It affects the free press worldwide. She's also moving with legislation. It will actually pass to the parliament to make it a free speech system over there and a zone for the Internet to be free and as a command base to have a node of Internet freedom to the rest of the world.
[02:17.000 --> 02:26.000]  So that's very, very exciting. This is the type of free speech zone we need, not one that limits speech, but one that is a fortress for liberty. So she'll be joining us coming up in the third hour.
[02:26.000 --> 02:37.000]  And then Larry Beacraft, constitutional lawyer. He's won before the Supreme Court and other major courts of the land, and he's not into patriot mythology, but he is a patriot.
[02:37.000 --> 02:43.000]  He covers the facts, and I really trust his opinion. He'll be joining us to talk about Elena Kagan.
[02:43.000 --> 02:57.000]  Now, in the last few months, I've read her quotes about how the government can disappear speech that is politically incorrect and how the Second Amendment is not an individual right.
[02:57.000 --> 03:15.000]  But there's a video. It's the number one video on YouTube, number one political video right now of her because the U.S. Supreme Court, when she was Solicitor General, only allows audio of some of the hearings and never video.
[03:15.000 --> 03:22.000]  And there's audio of her pleading before the Supreme Court and arguing that books can be banned.
[03:22.000 --> 03:27.000]  Now, this will probably mean she gets confirmed even faster.
[03:27.000 --> 03:35.000]  But she spins it as if, well, we do have that on the books. We can ban books, but we're not exercising that.
[03:35.000 --> 03:46.000]  Oh, really, this has gotten some attention in major newspapers. Bruce Shore was watching a C-SPAN event last year and saw a senator talk about cutting off his unemployment benefits.
[03:46.000 --> 03:53.000]  And Mr. Shore sent an email saying, are you kidding? Are you insane? That's a quote.
[03:53.000 --> 04:03.000]  I will starve to death. And for calling them insane or asking, that is seen as, under the federal law, that is seen as annoying.
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.000]  And so it's a felony and he's been indicted and is facing federal felonies.
[04:08.000 --> 04:16.000]  Now, the government said though, oh, we've had this on the books since 1996, and this is the first time they're using it.
[04:16.000 --> 04:23.000]  That's the point. Bill Clinton signed an executive order in 1994. It's in my film, America Destroyed by Design, 1997.
[04:23.000 --> 04:33.000]  I just want to release that, where it said they're going to take blood at checkpoints, blood at DMVs to get driver's license, you know, drug testing to get unemployment.
[04:33.000 --> 04:40.000]  It's the government once in your body. And just now, they're starting to propose it in England and some parts of the U.S.
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  Just now, they're letting you know they took your baby's blood at birth.
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  Yeah, we need to look at what's on the books. Why would they pass a law that they can ban books?
[04:49.000 --> 04:57.000]  And then only want to use it later. You know, I don't use a gun at my house every day, but it's there.
[04:57.000 --> 05:04.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[05:04.000 --> 05:09.000]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[05:11.000 --> 05:17.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[05:17.000 --> 05:23.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[05:23.000 --> 05:29.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old, powerful shadow state.
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[05:38.000 --> 05:44.000]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  It's only the beginning of the Neural Order's hellish plan.
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  The police state isn't coming.
[05:49.000 --> 05:54.000]  It's here. Secure your copy today at infowars.com

[07:18.000 --> 07:22.000]  After the battle starts, when will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[07:22.000 --> 07:25.000]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[07:38.000 --> 07:40.000]  How much will you need? We don't know.
[07:40.000 --> 07:43.000]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[07:43.000 --> 07:50.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.000]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[07:53.000 --> 08:01.000]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[08:01.000 --> 08:08.000]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:08.000 --> 08:16.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.000]  Alright, we'll take you to Iceland coming up in about two hours.
[08:19.000 --> 08:24.000]  The latest on the WikiLeaks situation and how this affects the press worldwide.
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  And what are these new videos and documents they're saying they're going to be releasing
[08:28.000 --> 08:35.000]  that's got the Pentagon so upset they reportedly got death squads out there looking for the founder of WikiLeaks.
[08:35.000 --> 08:40.000]  So we'll go inside WikiLeaks through their spokesperson, Brigitte Jones-Dottier
[08:40.000 --> 08:45.000]  coming up in the third hour, then Larry B. Kraft, constitutional scholar and lawyer.
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  Constitutional lawyer will be joining us to talk about Elena Kagan.
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.000]  Now, I'm going to open the phones up throughout the broadcast today.
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.000]  And I want to get your take specifically on some of the news I'm going to mention.
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  But I would also ask callers that you can talk about whatever issue you want briefly.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  But then I want you to tell me something profound.
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  What do you think the meaning of life is?
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  What do you think is most important in this world?
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  What is your philosophy if you had to sum up life?
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  I mean, life is amazing.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  Look at the human heart.
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.000]  It beats from the time you're conceived right up until the time you die.
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.000]  One piece of equipment.
[09:28.000 --> 09:35.000]  This science can't even begin to mimic it or the unbelievable complexity of a blood cell
[09:35.000 --> 09:42.000]  or a brain cell, a neuron.
[09:42.000 --> 09:50.000]  Think about how otherworldly it is, how we're on the middle of this beautiful planet
[09:50.000 --> 09:57.000]  hurtling through space around the sun, deep in the cosmos.
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  And there's all of this creation around us.
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  And we don't even really notice it.
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  We just go on about our business.
[10:03.000 --> 10:10.000]  Sunsets and thunderstorms and the wind and the forest and flowers and little birds
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.000]  outside your window making a nest in the tree.
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.000]  Baby squirrels, cottontails running around in the park at night.
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.000]  I mean, there's just so much beauty, so much good in the world, so much innocence.
[10:22.000 --> 10:31.000]  Children are so filled with wonder and creativity and that spark of creation.
[10:31.000 --> 10:43.000]  And this corporate system, this plastic, manufactured, dehumanized web is pulled up over our faces,
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  over our psyches, over our souls, and we're just enveloped by the unreal,
[10:48.000 --> 10:59.000]  enveloped by the petty, enveloped by artificial social stratos.
[10:59.000 --> 11:04.000]  And we take for granted all the majesty that goes on around us.
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  Well, I don't take it for granted.
[11:06.000 --> 11:15.000]  I am stunned and staggered every day to be outside in God's creation.
[11:15.000 --> 11:23.000]  I am stunned and staggered by the incredible technological developments that mankind has seen.
[11:23.000 --> 11:30.000]  I mean, you go back 6,000 years ago, there were a handful of human settlements
[11:30.000 --> 11:37.000]  where agrarian farming societies had come together for mutual defense and industry.
[11:37.000 --> 11:43.000]  And mathematics and language and medicine was then developed.
[11:43.000 --> 11:52.000]  And then we started dealing with the problem of predatory government, predatory government,
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.000]  where people had come together for defense and they built little walled cities
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  and sometimes you had a good king and sometimes you had a bad king.
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  And there were scientific elites who hoarded their knowledge and used their understanding,
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  not just of mathematics and language and medicine and the stars and agriculture,
[12:08.000 --> 12:19.000]  but also their knowledge of how humans behaved and how they could manipulate fellow humans.
[12:19.000 --> 12:28.000]  And so it took humankind eons to pull themselves up to the point of no longer being hunter-gatherers,
[12:28.000 --> 12:38.000]  small bands on the edge of starvation, fighting off wild beast by night,
[12:38.000 --> 12:43.000]  scrabbling around the barren landscape by day, trying to eke out an existence.
[12:43.000 --> 12:50.000]  Eons to come to the point of the small agrarian town and then the fortress
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.000]  and then the region and the city-state and then the countries and empires.
[12:54.000 --> 13:05.000]  And all in the last hundred years we've seen Max Planck and others develop the theory of nuclei of the atom.
[13:05.000 --> 13:17.000]  And from that knowledge we've seen men like Albert Einstein develop the expanded calculations
[13:17.000 --> 13:24.000]  in German scientists to give us the atomic bomb and atomic power.
[13:24.000 --> 13:31.000]  Think of it, man's mind in 1900, Max Planck, 1900 developed the equations
[13:31.000 --> 13:40.000]  that with precision calculated how to create a chain reaction.
[13:40.000 --> 13:47.000]  Other scientists by 1934 had developed specific blueprints for nuclear reactors
[13:47.000 --> 13:54.000]  and had brought them both American, German scientists, Jewish scientists and others
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  that all basically simultaneously, that's the way it always works,
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  at certain developmental levels in humanity, there's enough facts, enough information,
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  enough daydreaming going on, enough belief that we can build something
[14:06.000 --> 14:12.000]  or manifest it that simultaneously in three different countries
[14:12.000 --> 14:21.000]  men developed detailed plans by 1934 to build nuclear reactors
[14:21.000 --> 14:28.000]  and by 1939 it had officially been split, the atom had been split in Germany by German scientists
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  and it turns out it had been done before in the United States and other countries
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.000]  but it had been brought to the scientists, the higher up academics
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  and brought to the governments and brought to industry
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  and they couldn't even understand it or believe it
[14:44.000 --> 14:50.000]  even though top physicists were telling them that theoretically the mathematics shows
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  that this is what is going to happen.
[14:53.000 --> 14:59.000]  1939 they finally made the academics who were in an old way of thinking
[14:59.000 --> 15:04.000]  understand and when they physically split the atom
[15:04.000 --> 15:15.000]  and here we are, 60 plus years ago, 70 years.
[15:15.000 --> 15:26.000]  Think about that, 70 years later, 71 years later, 39 to 2010.
[15:26.000 --> 15:34.000]  Here we are and the military industrial complex, the different corporate combines
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  they have been dumping unlimited trillions.
[15:37.000 --> 15:46.000]  Over 250 billion was spent in 1940's money to give you the A-bomb.
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.000]  That's the equivalent of what, 10 trillion or so today?
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  Trying to do the calculations this morning?
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.000]  It's in the trillions.
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.000]  That's the type of stuff I'm thinking about because I know that with the genetic engineering
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.000]  they for at least five years admit that they have new genetic life forms
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  that have over 100 different plants, animals and insects in them.
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  Do you have any idea how dangerous that is?
[16:10.000 --> 16:14.000]  The genetic chain reactions that all of the mathematics shows
[16:14.000 --> 16:17.000]  has already begun and already started
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.000]  and how it will then affect other organisms that will then have mutations
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.000]  that will affect other organisms and that mathematically it shows
[16:24.000 --> 16:29.000]  that there will be a disaster caused by what's already been done.
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  It just takes time in genetics through the replication process
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.000]  that all the genetics that this planet has known for millions of years
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  is now being irrevocably violated and changed
[16:41.000 --> 16:48.000]  and the people doing it admit that they know it has a great possibility
[16:48.000 --> 16:53.000]  of disaster and there's tens of thousands of these things going on simultaneously
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.000]  and so that it's a mathematics certainty that's going to cause global meltdowns and crises
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.000]  and they don't care.
[17:01.000 --> 17:05.000]  Now, does American Idol matter or does your waistline matter
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  when you understand that information?
[17:07.000 --> 17:12.000]  Any of you that have children, how can you care about looking cool at church
[17:12.000 --> 17:15.000]  or some new business deal you're hoping to get
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.000]  and have a larger big screen television or take your wife to a better resort?
[17:19.000 --> 17:24.000]  I mean, there is no future if you don't make this the priority
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  to realize just how serious this world is
[17:27.000 --> 17:33.000]  and how good this world is and how valuable it is.
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  It's important to become informed.
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  It's important to be involved.
[17:37.000 --> 17:44.000]  It's important to be part of the decision making process as a species.
[17:44.000 --> 17:51.000]  It is vital to our survival that we have a true global debate
[17:51.000 --> 17:56.000]  about where this planet is going because the people that made the decision
[17:56.000 --> 18:04.000]  in the last hundred years on the course of civilization,
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.000]  whether it's right or wrong, for the sake of debate,
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  I'll just say whether it's right or wrong,
[18:10.000 --> 18:15.000]  have made the decision that we are a disease, the majority of us,
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.000]  and must be eradicated and they state it everywhere publicly
[18:20.000 --> 18:23.000]  and the public is so weak-minded,
[18:23.000 --> 18:28.000]  most of them can't even look at the information because it's in a textbook
[18:28.000 --> 18:33.000]  or because it's in a globalist Davos Switzerland meeting video cast.
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  They just out of hand say it can't be true
[18:36.000 --> 18:44.000]  because they come face to face with something so big, so monstrous, so real.
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.000]  This is a group of elites that believe they are ascendant.
[18:47.000 --> 18:49.000]  They believe they are a different species from us.
[18:49.000 --> 18:53.000]  They believe that they are in power because they are the best
[18:53.000 --> 18:56.000]  and they believe we are a disease killing the earth
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  and that we are going to be removed
[18:58.000 --> 19:03.000]  and everything we've seen up at this point is just the testing of soft-kill weapons,
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  the refining of covert agents.
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  They've been seeing how many of us they can give to degenerative diseases,
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  how many of us they can kill covertly.
[19:10.000 --> 19:13.000]  They've been testing the medical establishment to see if low-level people
[19:13.000 --> 19:16.000]  can ever do their own research and discover what's happening
[19:16.000 --> 19:20.000]  and if they'll have the political will to stand up and say no.
[19:20.000 --> 19:25.000]  And there has been that political will by the majority of EPA and FDA scientists
[19:25.000 --> 19:28.000]  coming out and saying sodium fluoride causes bone cancer, brain damage,
[19:28.000 --> 19:31.000]  and reductions in fertility and you know this, why are you doing it?
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  They've been doing that for a decade and the government just says we're not stopping.
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.000]  In fact, we're not going to put one part per million in the water.
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  We're going to put 900 parts per million in most of the refined foods you're eating.
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  I didn't even know that till yesterday.
[19:43.000 --> 19:48.000]  I did some research, I'm sending an email and found it always gets 100 times worse than I even do.
[19:48.000 --> 19:51.000]  They are just poisoning everything, ladies and gentlemen.
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.000]  And I mean, are they right?
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  Are you so cowardly and dumb and stupid
[19:54.000 --> 19:58.000]  that you can't even face what they're doing to you openly to try to stop it?
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  They say you deserve it.
[20:00.000 --> 20:04.000]  What if your local grocery store was suddenly closed?
[20:04.000 --> 20:08.000]  What if a crisis of world events caused anarchy?
[20:08.000 --> 20:12.000]  The time to prepare yourself and your family for what if is now.

[22:00.000 --> 22:05.000]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.000]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[22:08.000 --> 22:12.000]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[22:16.000 --> 22:22.000]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.000]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[22:26.000 --> 22:30.000]  Somebody is going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[22:30.000 --> 22:31.000]  You have been warned.
[22:31.000 --> 22:35.000]  We have the facts, we have the constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law.
[22:35.000 --> 22:39.000]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  Don't tread on me, rise of the republic.
[22:41.000 --> 22:46.000]  Terrany is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.

[23:56.000 --> 24:19.000]  I'm going to cover some news and then I want to open the phones up specifically. What do you think the meaning of life is?
[24:19.000 --> 24:25.000]  Is humanity, is decency, is goodness worth fighting for?
[24:25.000 --> 24:31.000]  Can some of you out there think I'm making up how dire our straights are, how real all this is?
[24:31.000 --> 24:38.000]  The globalists are openly saying they're preparing to strike Iran that will undoubtedly lead to terror attacks going on nationwide,
[24:38.000 --> 24:46.000]  many of which will be staged as a pretext to make trillions more on no-bid weapons contracts in the next decade,
[24:46.000 --> 24:49.000]  trillions on domestic police state takeovers.
[24:49.000 --> 24:53.000]  Oh yeah, they spent $1.2 billion just on three days at the G20.
[24:53.000 --> 24:57.000]  Again, they fund our destruction with our money.
[24:57.000 --> 25:01.000]  That's a huge payout to them.
[25:01.000 --> 25:07.000]  They are openly giving the Federal Reserve complete power over the entire economy to accelerate the robbing and looting,
[25:07.000 --> 25:12.000]  and they admit the Washington Post, it's at least $600 trillion in derivatives these criminals created,
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.000]  but they say that's a good thing.
[25:17.000 --> 25:23.000]  Now suddenly they're all over the news going, oh yes, the MMR shot is massively increasing children having seizures.
[25:23.000 --> 25:31.000]  It's good. Oh yes, your powdered eggs that you get at a fast food restaurant, 900 parts per million.
[25:31.000 --> 25:36.000]  And it goes on in the medical report to say this causes many adults and children to throw up.
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  And then that's when people are going, yeah, when I eat powered eggs, I get a stomach ache, never knew why.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  900 parts per million.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  Bread can have 100 parts per million.
[25:44.000 --> 25:50.000]  One part per million in major studies causes a 10 to 20 point IQ reduction,
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.000]  depending on which study you look at, over a decade of children drink it.
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  I mean, one part per million is devastating cumulative poison.
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.000]  900 parts per million, it's in everything.
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  Look at people, they look poisoned.
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.000]  Even if they're in good shape and exercise and people look poisoned, they're poisoning us.
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.000]  I mean, I can't even dislike thuggish police anymore.
[26:13.000 --> 26:17.000]  I can't dislike out of control tyrants, mid level anymore.
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  Because I realize they're just slaves too.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  They're being poisoned. They're being killed.
[26:21.000 --> 26:22.000]  They have no idea.
[26:22.000 --> 26:36.000]  Yesterday, Steve Watson wrote an article about people at the G20, peaceful protesters singing Canada O Canada, the national anthem, peacefully on a street corner.
[26:36.000 --> 26:44.000]  And the police charge them at full speed and knock men, women and children down and beat them in the head with batons.
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  And then march around on power trips beating their shields with their batons.
[26:49.000 --> 26:56.000]  And the headline, it's here in my stack, dealt with the fact that snatching grabs are happening there.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  I had G20 people on, G20 reporters.
[26:59.000 --> 27:08.000]  And yesterday I was saying, at least you're not having unmarked cars pull up with plain clothes people grabbing people and putting them in vans like happened at the G20 in Pittsburgh.
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  And they said, oh, no, that's happening, Alex.
[27:10.000 --> 27:17.000]  And then I got off the air and noticed that Steve Watson had posted a present planet dot com article with video after video.
[27:17.000 --> 27:26.000]  And even the London Guardian, which normally supports the police state, you know, it's pro establishment, said one of their reporters was just off the street completely.
[27:26.000 --> 27:33.000]  And in front of other witnesses, other newspapers reported because their reporters were all together that they beat the guy and beat him.
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.000]  And he was begging saying, why?
[27:34.000 --> 27:41.000]  And the cops were just laughing, beating him and punching him in the stomach and saying, stand him up and then just beat.
[27:41.000 --> 27:49.000]  Well, you know what? See those mindless cops in a mob, shark like feeding frenzy of blood and destruction.
[27:49.000 --> 27:57.000]  There is the egghead scientist type that enjoys raw domination as well, but they do it coldly, quietly.
[27:57.000 --> 28:08.000]  They're a thousand miles away when you're eating that those powdered eggs that you get at the fast food restaurant that have nine hundred.
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  Let me just get the article here.
[28:11.000 --> 28:23.000]  Yeah, it's nine hundred, a thousand and nine hundred parts per million.
[28:23.000 --> 28:29.000]  I mean, you're drinking the water, you're eating the GMO food, you're being murdered slowly.
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.000]  You think you've got the raw power of the state and it's a religion that you're in charge.
[28:34.000 --> 28:39.000]  And if anybody gives you the smallest excuse, you're going to beat them to a pulp.
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  John P. Holdren, a little cold blooded control freak scientist.
[28:43.000 --> 28:48.000]  They've got that same area of their mind that likes murder and death and oppression and injustice.
[28:48.000 --> 28:52.000]  And you know what? They're soft killing you.
[28:52.000 --> 28:59.000]  They're hitting you from a distance and they know you don't have the mental strength to admit it to yourself.
[28:59.000 --> 29:02.000]  So I mean, how do you hate some mindless aberration?
[29:02.000 --> 29:08.000]  I don't know. I just feel sorry for them. They're like a mad dog.
[29:08.000 --> 29:15.000]  And I noticed that at the G20, it looked like it was fake and it turned out it was G20 security in plain clothes and in military uniforms,
[29:15.000 --> 29:22.000]  grabbing people off the street and I analyzed the video and it looked like it was a staged event to create fear
[29:22.000 --> 29:27.000]  so that word would spread. The national media did pick it up, which is another sign it was staged
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  and you know, say, oh my God, they're just snatching and grabbing people.
[29:31.000 --> 29:38.000]  Well, I analyzed the countless videos last night from the G20 in Toronto. It's not fake.
[29:38.000 --> 29:43.000]  They are brutally jumping on people's heads, plain clothes men are dragging people off the black and blue vans.
[29:43.000 --> 29:46.000]  They are openly setting the precedent to snatch and grab.
[29:46.000 --> 29:50.000]  You put a bag over your head and Soviet style drag you off to be tortured.
[29:50.000 --> 29:54.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[29:54.000 --> 30:01.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.000 --> 30:07.000]  The fall of America and the western world is an all new 10 hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[30:07.000 --> 30:12.000]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[30:12.000 --> 30:20.000]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Ike, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre,

[30:59.000 --> 31:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[31:04.000 --> 31:08.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[31:08.000 --> 31:14.000]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[31:14.000 --> 31:19.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[31:19.000 --> 31:24.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[31:24.000 --> 31:28.000]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[31:28.000 --> 31:31.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[31:31.000 --> 31:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[31:35.000 --> 31:40.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[31:40.000 --> 31:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[31:45.000 --> 31:49.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[31:59.000 --> 32:01.000]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[32:01.000 --> 32:04.000]  You've heard me talk about Caledon five-star soaps for years.

[32:58.000 --> 33:00.000]  Thank you.
[33:29.000 --> 33:36.000]  If it isn't true that Bayer Pharmaceutical, they were caught in court five years ago, six years ago, knowingly for over a decade,
[33:36.000 --> 33:42.000]  mixing HIV with Factor 8 blood product for hemophiliacs, you know, that wasn't true folks.
[33:42.000 --> 33:45.000]  I'd be sued off the air very quickly. I wouldn't be here.
[33:45.000 --> 33:48.000]  But I go on talk shows. I go on other people's radio shows.
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.000]  I went on opening in Anthony for an hour and a half this morning.
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.000]  They invited me on. I know it's a very popular program.
[33:56.000 --> 34:00.000]  And I would tell them things like this and then they would just say, well, that's your opinion.
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  No, it's not my opinion.
[34:02.000 --> 34:06.000]  State Department memorandum 200 is not my opinion.
[34:06.000 --> 34:12.000]  John P. Holdren talking about putting sterilants in the water, the White House science are, is not my opinion.
[34:12.000 --> 34:19.000]  United Nations biological diversity assessment saying we want a world government for at least an 80% world population reduction.
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  That is not my opinion.
[34:21.000 --> 34:28.000]  To have the UN and the IMF and World Bank call for a new global government where you pay your taxes to private central banks
[34:28.000 --> 34:33.000]  and every facet of our lives is regulated and controlled to destroy industrial society.
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  That's a quote is not my opinion.
[34:36.000 --> 34:42.000]  Don't you get it, folks? You can choose what you want to be real and what you don't want to be real.
[34:42.000 --> 34:49.000]  So if you go to the doctor and they say, Mr. Johnson, you have one of the most deadly types of brain tumors on your brain stem.
[34:49.000 --> 34:54.000]  Generally, at this advanced stage, you may only have weeks to live, maximum two months.
[34:54.000 --> 34:57.000]  Please get your affairs in order.
[34:57.000 --> 35:03.000]  And most of the time, I've read in the medical journals, people laugh and go out and say, oh, I'm getting a second opinion.
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.000]  That doctor's nuts.
[35:04.000 --> 35:11.000]  Most people, now if you studied 100 years ago, if somebody was told they're terminal, people were tough about it and they'd say, okay, and get ready.
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  But not Americans, not modern Westerners.
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  We think perceptions reality.
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.000]  No, that's not true. I don't have a terminal brain tumor.
[35:20.000 --> 35:26.000]  But then later, once they can't walk and they're having trouble breathing, they're there with their family getting their stuff in order.
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.000]  I mean, this isn't a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  Okay, I mean, I was shook up last night.
[35:31.000 --> 35:38.000]  My wife came in while I was eating dinner and she came in when I got in bed early last night because I had to get up at 5am and she said, what's wrong?
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  And I just said, you know what's wrong.
[35:41.000 --> 35:42.000]  You know what's wrong?
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  We've got three great children.
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  Unfortunately, I've been right about everything.
[35:46.000 --> 35:47.000]  It's only getting worse.
[35:47.000 --> 35:48.000]  It's all coming to a head.
[35:48.000 --> 35:58.000]  And I just wish I had better powers of persuasion to reach out to people and to get them to understand how serious this is.
[35:58.000 --> 36:06.000]  When the show ended, when I was on Opie and Anthony for an hour and a half, when it ended, the last two or three minutes, they had it potted up on the ISD in line in our control room here.
[36:06.000 --> 36:14.000]  We did it studio to studio because if stations have ISD ends, we'll, we'll do it over that so they have better quality.
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.000]  And I heard the last three minutes like Alex is a nice guy.
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.000]  He's a popular radio host, but he is just that a radio host.
[36:20.000 --> 36:24.000]  You know, he's doing that for ratings and I'm sure that's not the person he really is.
[36:24.000 --> 36:29.000]  You know, I always get that all the time or somebody will walk up on the street and say, is your name really Alex Jones?
[36:29.000 --> 36:32.000]  I mean, do you really believe all this stuff you talk about?
[36:32.000 --> 36:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you shouldn't be asking me if I really believe what I'm saying.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  You should be out finding out if it's true.
[36:39.000 --> 36:45.000]  You know, I wonder after I talked to those cops Sunday at a barbecue joint for cops eating dinner.
[36:45.000 --> 36:50.000]  I walked over to them and told them about the New World Order, the world government, how sodium fluoride attacks all their organs.
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.000]  If they care about their family, please research it, how they've got decisions to make about what side they're going to be on.
[36:55.000 --> 37:01.000]  And they actually looked like they were, you know, took it and received it well and one of them said, yeah, I know about the world government.
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  They clearly knew who I was, at least some of them.
[37:04.000 --> 37:10.000]  But I wonder if after I left, they kind of laughed it off, you know, just because they were uncomfortable and oh yeah, tinfoil hat.
[37:10.000 --> 37:18.000]  Let me tell you something, tinfoil hat, saying tinfoil hat doesn't cover you having chemical weapons put in your food and water.
[37:18.000 --> 37:27.000]  They are guaranteed to reduce the length of your life and to really damage your brain and rob you of your intellect and your psyche.
[37:27.000 --> 37:32.000]  I mean, I respect your mind. I respect your life. I respect your private property.
[37:32.000 --> 37:35.000]  I love my fellow humans. You understand that?
[37:35.000 --> 37:43.000]  I have a deep and abiding love of the truth and of everything good and it upsets me to see them hurting you.
[37:43.000 --> 37:51.000]  And all I want to do is to see you stand up as men and women and at least go look at the facts so you'll know I'm not lying to you.
[37:51.000 --> 38:03.000]  To see these people that think they can just make jokes about it, to see these people.
[38:03.000 --> 38:09.000]  And I'm ashamed of myself. You know, I get worldly. I get angry. I get nasty. I feel powerless.
[38:09.000 --> 38:17.000]  That's when I tend to get nasty yesterday watching Kagan snarling at the Congress and knowing all the evil things she's written and supported as Solicitor General
[38:17.000 --> 38:25.000]  as a Clinton-era hack operative and as a pro-partial-birth abortion carry-in-crow.
[38:25.000 --> 38:33.000]  And I started, you know, getting down to name-calling and calling her a demonic pelican and calling her John Wayne Kagan Gacy.
[38:33.000 --> 38:45.000]  And she looks like an evil clown. I noticed up on the Alex Jones channel, Dave, who runs the Alex Jones channel, actually found the penguin from Batman
[38:45.000 --> 38:53.000]  from the theatrical release and it actually is her. I mean, I swear you could, but still, that's infantile.
[38:53.000 --> 39:02.000]  I should cover what she said and what she stands for. I shouldn't attack her for how she looks because that's wrong because there are a lot of good people who are ugly
[39:02.000 --> 39:09.000]  and who don't deserve to be compared to her. I'm ugly compared to a lot of people and I'm getting uglier.
[39:09.000 --> 39:14.000]  And the most beautiful woman out there is going to be ugly when they're old, but it's their deeds that are important.
[39:14.000 --> 39:19.000]  I don't know. There's something beautiful about an old sweet woman's hands and the wrinkles. You know what I mean.
[39:19.000 --> 39:26.000]  It's what's inside Kagan that makes her even more ugly. It's like a demonic light shining out of that bulbous face.
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.000]  And I was just tuned in last night. I was doing research and heard about 10 minutes of my show and I turned it off and wanted to throw up.
[39:31.000 --> 39:40.000]  I am an embarrassment. I am. You don't understand what it's like, ladies and gentlemen, to know the score, to know the cost, to know how serious this is,
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.000]  to know it's real and then to fall down and screw around the way I do.
[39:45.000 --> 39:50.000]  But you know what? We're all an embarrassment, but we're also all an enlightenment.
[39:50.000 --> 39:55.000]  We're also all, there's the best in us. There's the worst in us. And that's what it is to be human.
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.000]  And I'm just here to tell you that we've got to defeat this new world order.
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.000]  We have got to reach out to as many people as we can and wake them up now.
[40:04.000 --> 40:10.000]  You know, yesterday I kept saying I'd get to the news and I never even really got to much of it.
[40:10.000 --> 40:18.000]  I covered some more than most talk shows get to because they're so full of mindless fluff.
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.000]  But we're going to go to Carlton, Luke, Robert, Nathan, Frank and others here in just a moment.
[40:23.000 --> 40:27.000]  But let me just read some of the headlines of the five stacks I have today.
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.000]  Let me just read to you some of the headlines I have here in front of me today.
[40:32.000 --> 40:37.000]  Stocks tumble. They're down about 250 points right now. Stocks tumble on global economic worries.
[40:37.000 --> 40:44.000]  Stocks interest rates tumble Tuesday after fresh signs of a global economic slowdown, spooked investors.
[40:44.000 --> 40:52.000]  U.S. markets are following those in Asia, which fell when Japanese data showed the nation's recovery has slowed
[40:52.000 --> 40:58.000]  and the European indexes fell sharply after Greek workers walked off the job to protest steep budget cuts.
[40:58.000 --> 41:05.000]  Well, yeah, because it's money they don't owe. G8 fully believes Israel will attack Iran.
[41:05.000 --> 41:10.000]  It says Italian Prime Minister. That's out of herettes. And now the U.S. aircraft carrier has arrived.
[41:10.000 --> 41:15.000]  It's right off the coast of Iran. And of course, they've passed sanctions against them, which are acts of war.
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  And there's Israel saying, again, they're getting ready to strike.
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.000]  And the word out of Bilderberg is that we told you three weeks ago is they're going to hit them.
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  It's been given the green light for the first time.
[41:25.000 --> 41:31.000]  Now, an act of God can change this, but a lot of good old boys are out there going good, kill me some Arabs.
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  They're not even Arabs. Remember, you're going to pay for this war. We're already bankrupt.
[41:35.000 --> 41:41.000]  The government's going to use the fake patriotism of this new war to get everybody to rally around the government
[41:41.000 --> 41:47.000]  while they pass the banking takeover, while they pass the carbon taxes, while they wait for that hurricane to come in
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.000]  and blow all that oil up on shore so they can get a big emergency going.
[41:51.000 --> 41:56.000]  You're being attacked just like the Iranian people by the scientific dictatorship.
[41:56.000 --> 42:01.000]  You better understand that. We've got a lot more in common with the Iranian people.
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.000]  Lord knows their government's corrupt, but we've got a lot more in common with them than we do with the New World Order.
[42:06.000 --> 42:12.000]  So those of you that feel some primitive tribal power trip and imagining the annihilation of your tribal enemy,
[42:12.000 --> 42:19.000]  because the news told you your tribal enemy is those Persians, those poor Persians have had their government overthrown twice by us.
[42:19.000 --> 42:28.000]  Oh, yeah. Those Persians have put up with eight years of our government running al-Qaeda attack squads.
[42:28.000 --> 42:35.000]  This is admitted against their Shiite government bombing police military, killing their generals, killing bombing schools.
[42:35.000 --> 42:43.000]  I mean, our government admits they do this. And Iran lays there and takes it, knowing the United States of Israel wants to nuke them.
[42:43.000 --> 42:50.000]  Do you think the globalists don't want to nuke your butt? They are nuking you with the food. They're nuking the food you eat.
[42:50.000 --> 42:55.000]  The globalists want you dead, folks. They want you out of the way. They don't need physical slaves anymore.
[42:55.000 --> 43:02.000]  They've got robotics, okay? They understand that they are having trouble maintaining control.
[43:02.000 --> 43:08.000]  They want you out of the way. Look at this. G8 fully believes Israel will attack Iran's Israeli prime minister.
[43:08.000 --> 43:17.000]  Obama doctrine. Congress just declared preemptive war on Iran. Yeah, just like they passed a resolution in 2002 saying whatever the president wants to do, do it.
[43:17.000 --> 43:23.000]  Not a declaration of war. Not Congress saying this is how you prosecute the war. Here's the war. Here's the enemy.
[43:23.000 --> 43:33.000]  Now you carry it out. You execute. See, the football coach is the Congress and they give the orders, the plays to the quarterback that is the executive.
[43:33.000 --> 43:39.000]  And the referees are the judges. You understand how that works?
[43:39.000 --> 43:45.000]  The Congress, because it's the biggest body of the people and it's the most divided because they didn't want a dictator coming to control.
[43:45.000 --> 43:53.000]  So it's separation of powers. The Congress represents the states, the House and the Senate. And so it is the football coach.
[43:53.000 --> 44:02.000]  And it gives the plays to the quarterback and he executes it. You understand that? You understand that?
[44:02.000 --> 44:12.000]  You can read the Federalist Papers. The Congress has got the Trump and the referees of the courts.
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.000]  The referees can't make up new rules. The quarterback can't make up new rules.
[44:17.000 --> 44:25.000]  The Congress is the football coach and the inventor of the game. They created the country. They make the rules and they execute the plays.
[44:25.000 --> 44:29.000]  You understand that?
[44:29.000 --> 44:38.000]  Now what's democracy? Democracy is you get 100,000 fans out there and the 22 members of the two teams stand up there and say, who do you think is the most popular?
[44:38.000 --> 44:49.000]  You 100,000 drunken fans. You decide who the dictator of the game will be and the fans say, okay, well, we say the Cowboys wing because it's a home game and the Redskins lose.
[44:49.000 --> 44:53.000]  Democracy is a stinking fraud.
[44:53.000 --> 44:59.000]  We put the Congress together. We decided that everybody's rights would be guarded.
[44:59.000 --> 45:06.000]  And then it calls the shots. But no, Obama doctrine, Congress just declared preemptive war on Iran.
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.000]  They just told Obama the quarterback, do whatever you want, pal.
[45:10.000 --> 45:13.000]  I'm going to go up in the stands and get drunk.
[45:13.000 --> 45:24.000]  War with Iran has already been declared by the powers that be in the modern quasi declaration happened last Thursday using the same legislative and propaganda playbook that led to the Iraq war.
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.000]  The U.S. government has just officially declared war on Iran.
[45:28.000 --> 45:43.000]  Reuters reported Congress on Thursday approved tough new unilateral sanctions aimed at squeezing Iran's energy and banking sectors, which could also hurt companies from other countries doing business with a Tehran.
[45:43.000 --> 45:49.000]  The House representatives passed the bill, 408 and Senate to President Barack Obama decided to law.
[45:49.000 --> 45:54.000]  The Senate had hoped it to be a 99 to zero earlier in the day.
[45:54.000 --> 45:58.000]  Congress hasn't officially voted on the declaration of war since World War II.
[45:58.000 --> 46:06.000]  In modern times, they use creative wording and bills that authorize the broad use of force across borders and the sweeping war on terror.
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  And it goes on through all of that and how the U.N. really has the authority.
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.000]  Here's another one.
[46:13.000 --> 46:20.000]  China denies military exercise named at the U.S. that's out of Reuters.
[46:20.000 --> 46:31.000]  In a briefing to Congress, General Betraya said the security situation in Afghanistan remains tenuous with instability fueled by resilient and still confident insurgency.
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  See, your attitude is important.
[46:33.000 --> 46:38.000]  Tribal tensions, political challenges and competition for influence in the future.
[46:38.000 --> 46:44.000]  Betraya said in an answer to advanced questions submitted to him by the Senate Armed Services Committee.
[46:44.000 --> 46:47.000]  You know why you can't conquer Afghanistan?
[46:47.000 --> 46:50.000]  Number one, they're red-blooded. Number two, they're prehistoric.
[46:50.000 --> 46:55.000]  But number three and most important, they're all divided against each other.
[46:55.000 --> 47:01.000]  That's why the fathers that founded this country, the founding fathers said, we need division, we need gridlock.
[47:01.000 --> 47:05.000]  You get a big government working well, it's going to rob you.
[47:05.000 --> 47:08.000]  And you're seeing that now, aren't you?
[47:08.000 --> 47:12.000]  Bigger the government gets, the more they can't get anything done except rob you.
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.000]  It's designed to be an electronic straightjacket.
[47:16.000 --> 47:19.000]  Alex to become a hurricane as swells reach Gulf Spill.
[47:19.000 --> 47:26.000]  It had been hoped that the hurricane would take more of a south-westerly path into central Mexico instead.
[47:26.000 --> 47:32.000]  It's now veering up towards the northern Mexico coast, the northeastern coast and the south Texas coast.
[47:32.000 --> 47:37.000]  Governor Rick Perry has declared a state of emergency on the Texas coast.
[47:37.000 --> 47:41.000]  This is Bloomberg. Alex to become a hurricane as swells reach Gulf Spill.
[47:41.000 --> 47:49.000]  And so the hurricane now in the track it's sending out is already causing the oil to start moving in towards shore.
[47:49.000 --> 47:55.000]  And they're saying it's going to be one of the biggest hurricane seasons on record because the sun just ignited.
[47:55.000 --> 48:00.000]  It's like a light bulb where it kind of fades and then gets bright again and then fades and gets bright again.
[48:00.000 --> 48:05.000]  For three years, it's been real, real dim. It was real active.
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  And so the earth was getting warmer. Now it's been getting cooler.
[48:07.000 --> 48:12.000]  Now that sucker is heating up and look out.
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.000]  It's going to heat up those waters and here comes the hurricane. Here comes the cyclones.
[48:16.000 --> 48:19.000]  Here comes the typhoons in the Pacific.
[48:19.000 --> 48:25.000]  And Obama's done his job well blocking the Dutch and the Taiwanese.
[48:25.000 --> 48:30.000]  The Taiwanese ship we covered yesterday can scoop up more oil than all U.S. ships combined.
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  It's designed for it.
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.000]  Hundreds of thousands of barrels a day.
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  In fact, guys, that was in my stack yesterday. We reprint.
[48:38.000 --> 48:44.000]  I just searched the term Taiwan, Taiwanese oil ship waiting to be given authorization for aid.
[48:44.000 --> 48:51.000]  I want to, I forget the exact, I know it said it's more than all the ships can suck up combined right now.
[48:51.000 --> 48:54.000]  And that there's dozens of such ships available that have all been offering to come.
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.000]  But this particular one's the biggest in the world.
[48:57.000 --> 49:01.000]  And they're just saying, no, no, I mean, this one ship, it was some unbelievable amount.
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  I want to say 50,000 barrels, but it's just incredible.
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.000]  But no, no, because it's all got to sit there and wait for the hurricanes.
[49:08.000 --> 49:15.000]  They can allow the states to block it because Obama's going to use that to get more federal funds and pass the carbon tax, as he's now said.
[49:15.000 --> 49:18.000]  And that wasn't a hard prediction to make.
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  And we have to sit here and watch it.
[49:20.000 --> 49:24.000]  This is a sacrifice, a sacrificing Obama's approval rating.
[49:24.000 --> 49:29.000]  It's going to sacrifice the approval rating of BP.
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  They'll just change their name.
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.000]  What was that guys?
[49:34.000 --> 49:37.000]  500,000 barrels a day. See, I knew that.
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  That's AP.
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  Now there's the article on screen.
[49:40.000 --> 49:44.000]  I knew that, but then my mind couldn't believe one ship could get 500,000 barrels.
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  So I downgraded it psychologically to 50,000.
[49:47.000 --> 49:48.000]  That's why I knew.
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  Print that for me.
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  Yeah, 500,000 gallons.
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  Huge oil skimming ship makes Virginia stop.
[49:57.000 --> 50:09.000]  And it goes on to say it's begging the Taiwanese owned ship, builds the world's largest skimming vessel, was preparing to sail Friday evening to the scene of the deep water horizon disaster.
[50:09.000 --> 50:13.000]  Meanwhile, I'm on opening in Anthony telling him this, they're saying, that's your opinion.
[50:13.000 --> 50:14.000]  No, it's not my opinion.
[50:14.000 --> 50:20.000]  They admit the ship's the biggest in the world at this 500,000 barrels.
[50:20.000 --> 50:25.000]  And they're blocking it and they blocked all the other Dutch ships and Norwegian ships.
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  They've got some of the other big ones.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  There are dozens and dozens and dozens.
[50:29.000 --> 50:37.000]  One report I said, I saw a few days ago, so there's over a hundred of these just in our hemisphere, ready to come in and deal with this.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  But no, can't have it.
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  One ship, 500,000 barrels.
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.000]  No, no, no, no.
[50:45.000 --> 50:56.000]  In George Washington University Medical Center reporting, emergency medical physicians respond to oil spill syndrome in the Gulf Coast.
[50:56.000 --> 51:01.000]  Imagine when that blows into shore, exactly what the terrorist Obama wants.
[51:01.000 --> 51:02.000]  Who is Sam Andy?

[52:03.000 --> 52:06.000]  We are part of a new world order.

[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  It means all the world under their control.
[52:21.000 --> 52:24.000]  The United Nations would take over America.
[52:24.000 --> 52:27.000]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[52:27.000 --> 52:34.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[52:34.000 --> 52:40.000]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[52:40.000 --> 52:43.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[52:43.000 --> 52:47.000]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  Survival skills and off-the-grid living.

[54:07.000 --> 54:14.000]  You've got my guarantee when I start the next hour, I'm going to take 45 minutes of calls one after the other.
[54:14.000 --> 54:18.000]  And then the last 15 minutes will be news, because there's a bunch of news.
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.000]  I haven't gotten through one stack, but I did just cover part of the first stack.
[54:21.000 --> 54:24.000]  So that is coming up.
[54:24.000 --> 54:40.000]  But back to the Gulf, it is now 100% confirmed, 70-plus days into this disaster, 70-plus days into this situation.
[54:40.000 --> 54:46.000]  And now we know why, since day one, they wouldn't let the states and counties block the estuaries.
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  Why they wouldn't let them put up sand berms.
[54:48.000 --> 54:57.000]  Why they would just, and it's been confirmed over and over again that BP will call out some people to clean up a beach while the news media is there.
[54:57.000 --> 55:03.000]  And as soon as they leave, they just tell everybody to go home, because their BP is getting its own cleanup money.
[55:03.000 --> 55:11.000]  BP pays its own subsidiaries to do the cleanup, and then doesn't do the cleanup, and doesn't hire one-tenth of the people they need, and then keeps the money.
[55:11.000 --> 55:15.000]  They've invested in derivatives, the $20 billion they're putting in that fund.
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.000]  They're going to end up making money off this, and they're just going to change their name.
[55:19.000 --> 55:27.000]  And then they're going to get the carbon tax that their banker owners need that literally completes the world government funding system.
[55:27.000 --> 55:33.000]  This is a political sacrifice, just like in chess.
[55:33.000 --> 55:46.000]  And we need to start beating the drum now that Obama is blocking by design all relief efforts that aren't under his control,
[55:46.000 --> 55:55.000]  and the relief efforts that are under his control are being done in a minimalistic way that is ineffective by design
[55:55.000 --> 55:58.000]  to make the situation as bad as it can be.
[55:58.000 --> 56:05.000]  That is their nomenclature. That is their psychology. That is the MO of the globalist, just like Katrina.
[56:05.000 --> 56:08.000]  Bring in food and water. Make people stay at the sports dome.
[56:08.000 --> 56:11.000]  Don't give them food and water 10 feet away. Don't let them walk out on their own bridges.
[56:11.000 --> 56:14.000]  Shoot them if they try to leave. That's confirmed.
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.000]  Feds ordered it. Cops that followed orders all went to prison for it.
[56:19.000 --> 56:26.000]  Then everything falls apart, and they say, look, we need more funds. FEMA needs more power.
[56:26.000 --> 56:35.000]  Because presidents and FEMA directors are meant to look bad and be destroyed politically and fall on their sword for the system to get more power.
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.000]  You understand that?
[56:38.000 --> 56:43.000]  And so when all that oil comes in, we've only seen the tip of the iceberg. We've only seen a tiny fraction of it.
[56:43.000 --> 56:51.000]  You know, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of gallons of oil filled with all the toxic benzene and lead and mercury and the rest of it,
[56:51.000 --> 57:00.000]  when it hits the shores and comes up those waterways and up those rivers and is blown in many, many miles by the hurricane.
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.000]  And all these other hurricanes it will form in the next few months.
[57:04.000 --> 57:09.000]  We've got four or five months of hurricane season ahead of us right through into November.
[57:09.000 --> 57:13.000]  July, August, September, October, November. Yeah, five months of it.
[57:13.000 --> 57:20.000]  We've got five plus months of hurricane season. It's starting early with Alex, and they're not going to allow anybody to scoop that up.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  They need the biggest disaster they can get.
[57:23.000 --> 57:27.000]  Now, I'm about to end the first hour. Don't forget we have the online video bookstore at infowars.com.
[57:27.000 --> 57:34.000]  The best material to wake people up when you purchase books and videos and t-shirts. It also supports our operation.

[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  We are now into hour number two. I covered the fact that the hurricane is going to blow a lot of oil into the Gulf region.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  End of states like Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Florida. The feds are continuing to block that recovery.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  I got into the fact that they're all over the news and Israeli papers are saying the EU leaders are saying the G8 leaders are saying it looks like Israel is getting ready to hit Iran.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  U.S. aircraft carrier just arrived right off the coast. There's a battle fleet along with the Israeli fleet.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  We're getting into the economy. CNN's reporting a bunch of people are getting ill. 162 cases of illness linked to oil spill.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  Reporting in Louisiana. Major University Medical Centers reporting people are getting sick from the toxic chemicals.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  The Washington Post is floating the idea of 20 million evacuated. Others are saying the word is it's going to be 40 million.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  I don't know if that's going to happen, but let me tell you something.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  The fact that Obama is blocking that oil getting skimmed up out at sea when they can clean it up is high treason.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  And I want to be on record saying that this is a disaster. In fact, will you tell one of the guys to get a camera ready?
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  I want to shoot a YouTube video on emergency release at the end of the show today. Thanks.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  All right. I said I'd open the phones up for the next 45 minutes in the last 15 cover a bunch of other news we haven't gotten to.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  So let's do that right now. Carlton in California, you're on the air.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  Hi, Alex. How are you doing? Good.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  Yeah. You asked the question, what's the purpose of man? Right?
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  Yes.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  Let me just answer it this way.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  From a philosophical or a biblical view from a Christian.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  It says in Ecclesiastes, let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  Fear God and keep His commandments for this is the whole duty or purpose of man. Do you agree with that?
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  Yes. And the Bible also talks about we are to worship, but if you really the translation is Marvel and appreciate the creation.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  Absolutely. Well, man is destroying the creation. As you know, and there's a lot of debate over how to take care of the earth.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  You got the fanatic environmentalist who refused to.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  Well, the devil always creates a counterfeit. And so, you know, the devil institutes the program of destruction and then he offers the solution.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  Exactly. Well, man is destroying his environment and he's not following God's laws with regards to how to take care of the earth.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  But I think man has been given dominion according to Genesis and he's supposed to exercise dominion according to God's law.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  And it's a test.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  Oh, absolutely. And man has failed the test for the most part. But, you know, you got to look back at the fundamental nature of man.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  The liberals tend to see man as basically good. The Democrats, and you pointed this out, there's a false left, right paradigm between the two parties, the Democrats and Republicans.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  The Democrats tend to see man as basically good. And therefore we need more government to protect us from more, from other good men.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  You know, it's just kind of illogical, isn't it?
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  You've got the animus to worship the creation instead of the creator when we're supposed to appreciate the creator for the creation and see that as just a small bit of the handiwork.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  Exactly. And of course there's design all around us.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  Right, right. And well, anyway, another part of it is you got the Republicans who believe that man is basically evil by nature, but if left to himself, everything will work out okay.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  Which is also illogical. See, there has to be balance, Alex.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  Romans 13 saying worship the government, whatever it says to do, but that's a distortion. The whole Bible is about people standing up against evil leaders and saying, no, I'm going to follow God's law, not your law.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  And people can say all day, well, you can claim whatever you want is God's law, you know, there is no good and evil.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  But then they'll tell you that they want to take your free speech because something you say may hurt someone's feelings, but I thought there is no good and evil.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  I mean, it's a total cop-out. They don't want you having your morals and your compass. They've got their morals and their compass and it's perversion, death and destruction, loving death and destruction, death and hatred for all mankind.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  I appreciate your call, Carlton.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  Luke, Robert, Frank, Dave, your calls are straight ahead.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  On the other side of this quick break, 1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us on this live Tuesday edition, the 29th day of June 2010.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  The websites are infowars.net, JonesReport.com, prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com. Stay with us.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  You have been warned.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  We have the facts. We have the constitution. We have the Bill of Rights. We have common law.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  Don't tread on me. Rise the republic. Terrany is upon us.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  But liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.

[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  This information is too important to wait.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  This information is too important to wait.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  That's the new world order. That's how they operate.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  And so we'll be going over some of that more on Elena Kagan.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  Of course, we've got this audio clip from her pleading before the Supreme Court
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  when she was solicitor general where she admits,
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  yes, there is a law that the government can ban books,
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  but we're not enforcing that right now.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  So that's going to come up after we take some more of your calls.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  But right now, let's take your calls.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  Luke in West Virginia, you're on the air.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  Well, Alex, how's it going? Good, sir.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  Well, what's the meaning of life?
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  I think really these days, it's not the same as it was hundreds of years ago.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  So you have to think, today you're bombarded with information on all sides, good and bad.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  I think the meaning of life today is to see what is and what is not real.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  Veritas is everything. Truth is everything.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  If you can truly find the truth, then you are fulfilled.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  And I agree with you. If a man finds the truth, he will find the key to the universe.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  I mean, the New World Order is real. It's there.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  The social control grid that keeps people online is there.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  You have to find what's real and that, you know?
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  One thing I've been thinking about lately is,
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  I'm a computer science major.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  You think about the Internet's watching, but what about that operating system?
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  Is it watching you? How deep does the control go?
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  What can you easily do to break loose of it?
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  Well, it's now admitted that Google is an NSA program,
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  and I could look at it six, seven years ago,
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  and it was a keyword NSA search program, and that's now admitted.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  It's a total government front. IBM's a government front.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  Microsoft has come out as a complete government front,
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  and they build back doors into everything.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  I mean, you'll see stories from time to time of a little computer company
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  that comes out with some encryption and refuses to give the key to the government
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  so you see the director of it get indicted or the place burns down
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  or there's a robbery and everyone's killed.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  I mean, it's just constant.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  The control of information, the control, and that's what freaks me out.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  I have proven to myself that so much of what we've been taught is a lie.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  How deep does it go? I mean, who knows what the truth is?
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  You know, I only stick to what I can prove, and that's so bizarre.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  Most people can't believe it. Who knows?
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  You've got to keep going until you keep going, keep finding more things out.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  Every time you find something new out, there's more and more and more.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  Another idea I had, which might be good for some people,
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  when I give out DVDs of your films, you can burn it as a DVD, put your DVD player,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  but if you burn it as a data CD, you need to put five or six films on there
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  and really get somebody who's ready to be in on it.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  So if anybody out there listened, you know, that'd be a good idea.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  That's what I've been doing. It's really been helping.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  I mean, if somebody's, you want this police to stay formic.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  Like, oh my God, you know, that's messed up.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  Like, yeah, well, it's easy for them to say, well, you'll watch other ones.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  Well, the reason police stay force so important is everybody knows they've got FEMA camps,
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  but we prove it. Everybody knows the police are acting more aggressive,
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  and they've been federalized, and there's threat fusion centers,
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  and there's license plate reading cameras, and there's foreign trips training.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  But this integrates it all in, in one place, in two hours and 25 minutes,
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  where people get the latest info, the full spectrum analysis,
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  compartmentalized police, compartmentalized military who are part of this,
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  who can't understand the full system they're in because it's designed that way.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  This is 15 years of research with the latest info boiled down in two hours and 25 minutes.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  That's why police state force so essential. I appreciate your call.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  I mean, here's an example. Every day or two now, I see mainstream articles
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  where they go, oh, foreign troops are in our town in Texas,
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  foreign troops are in our town in Illinois, foreign troops are in our town in Kentucky.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  Oh, they're training to take on terrorists, and then I'll actually send reporters
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  at great expense, at great expense for us.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  To Chicago for five days, and it's worse than we thought,
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  mass riot containment, roundup drills, troops from Eastern Europe,
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  Polish, Albanian, Romanian in other drills, Czech Republic,
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  German that I've been to, and they're training to take us on.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  I mean, but I don't even have to go and ferret this out anymore.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  They'll have New York Times articles going, look, the explorer scouts are training
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  to take on disgruntled veterans. In this drill, the veteran wouldn't turn his guns in,
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  so they went in and took them out, and it shows the simulated dead veteran
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  in the New York Times in a full color spread.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  I was on that OPI and Anthony show this morning, OPI and Anthony program,
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  which again is very popular with the trendies, millions of listeners,
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  and I would talk about things like that, and they would just say,
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  well, that's your opinion. It is not my opinion.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  It is not my opinion they're training foreign troops to take on the American people.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  It is not my opinion that children are being trained to take on veterans.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  It is not my opinion that I've received secret documents from federal police
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  and state police about how the federal government's number one enemy is gun owners,
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  conservatives, libertarians, and veterans. We're the ones that broke that.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  That's national news. That's admitted. That's not my opinion.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  This is a creepy out of control government that wants to run every facet of our lives
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  and is trying to train us to be slaves.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  And I for one have had enough of it.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  And I watched the video of those Canadian police enjoying beating people up
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  and private contractors pulling up in black and dark blue vans in shorts and t-shirts
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  and grabbing people and beating them up. This was real.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  The video I saw from Pittsburgh was fake.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  But notice how it's the same worldwide, the same MO, the same training.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  The globalist, the bankers come into town and they use it as a laboratory model of what they want.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  So last year at the meeting, it was fake to scare everybody.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  This year it was real. This was real.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  Jumping on people's heads after they were down, not resisting.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  Guys in plain clothes doing this and dragging them off.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  And the news saying it was private G20 security.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  Private G20 security relishing the fact that mercenaries are allowed to attack Canadians and Americans.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  Hell, one guy at the G20 last year in London was delivering newspapers to a convenience store
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  and he's walking with the stack of papers with his trolley and the cops come up on video
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  and they say get out of here and he said, okay, I'm just delivering newspapers
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  and when he turned his head, they beat him in the head.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  He even followed their stinking orders. They killed him.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  Then they lied about it.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  But later the video came out and was shown in court.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  I mean, you know, he's not a human to them.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  He's some poor guy, cops, who's trying to deliver newspapers.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  Yeah, the guys, whenever I'm talking, even though we're not live at prisonplanet.tv,
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  they're showing me cops from two years ago in Canada.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  This was later admitted they were cops.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  Dressed up like anarchist who were attacking other police as a pretext to then be able to attack the crowds.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  In fact, when we go live, make sure today I have, in fact, let's just go live at the bottom of the hour,
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  second place, some of that, or just show some of that in the background.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  This is so hard to deal with.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  When you understand this is a formula, it didn't matter if it's Spain or Italy or the U.S. or Canada or England,
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  they have hired cops or contractors, burn a few cars, and then they attack all the peaceful people.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  And now the citizens have identified cops staging fights so they're getting in their face.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  So now the police stage the arrest of the cops to get them out of the situation.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  These are a royal amount of police.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  What terrorist, man. They're just terrorists.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  And you stupid cops don't know that you're with the American people or the Canadian people.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  Don't you understand? You're going to be run over, too.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  Don't you know you're in the boat with us, you fools?
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  And I'm not saying you're a bad person individual.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  You're just like the rest of the dumbed-down public.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  But if you're listening now, for whatever reason, your destiny is to wake up.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  Alright, let's go to Robert in Utah. Robert, you're on the air.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  Hey, good morning, Alex. What's up with you?
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  That's a weird, I'm sorry, that's a dumb question.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.000]  Well, I just feel like the top of my head's blown off. I mean, more and more I just realize things
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000]  and understand things and it's it's it's it's frightening.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  Well, you know, I've started listening to you.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  I first heard you, I guess, back probably on coast to coast back in the 90s.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  And I just like, you know, I started listening to you probably a few months ago.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  And, you know, so you wake up, you use, I think maybe like the greatest gift that we have is probably
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  the power to discern things, to discern the crap that they try and spoon feed us daily.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  You know, and it with everything because it is so multifaceted.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  And I listen to you and and I and I and I hear the frustration in your voice and it's mirrored in.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  And it's meant to be so overwhelming that even intelligent intellectuals decide,
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  like in the matrix where he says he meets with the agents and he says, I don't want to remember anything.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  You know, I want to be a movie star. He's there drinking red wine and eating a steak.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  He wants to be put back in the false reality.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  And a lot of intelligent people, it's called Crime Stop in 1984.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  They decide to believe the delusion.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  Yeah, it's in. It's in. It's true.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  And you get, you know, I wanted to hear what you had to say there, Robert,
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  but your phone's cutting out. Are you there?
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  If Robert can get back on, I want to talk to him.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  Let's talk to Frank and then we'll go to break.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  Frank in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  Hi, Alex.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  Hey, buddy.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  You know, yes, or something profound.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  It's a mantra from my beautiful fiance, Jenna, who said, you know, she introduced me to a year ago,
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  but it's loose simply.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  And today I'm up in my garden, tying up my tomatoes and listening to Alex Jones on my iPod app,
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  literally the best two things in the world.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  But, you know, I mentioned something about the coverage of the G20 and saw a window of our near future.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  And it's a story of Khalid Sayed.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  Have you had the chance to learn about that?
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  Yes. Tell us about it on the other side, Frank.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  And then we'll try to get Robert back on the Dave, Everett, Brian and others.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  Continue with calls. Stay with us.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms,
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.000]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild, edible food?
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  and your loved ones against any future craziness and put up tons of free food, too.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000]  Our foods are their enemy.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000]  Make your OASIS of food security and nutrition now.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D.com.

[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from infowars.com.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  We have some specials when you get some of our other films.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  Half price when you order Shadow Government.

[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  It exposes how a cashless society surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000]  This film needs to be seen. Everybody needs to get it.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  So order yours today.

[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  Shadow Government, it gives big brother a black eye.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  Available at infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the Fiat continental system.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.000]  Wisdom being lost with time, the government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:25.000]  has colluded with private business, creating the largest Fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government,
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  Call me today at 800-686-2237. I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.

[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000]  Okay, here it comes. But first, the facts.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  67 other products merely treat symptoms, and not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis. SinoFresh.

[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  Alright, let's go back to Frank in Ohio. Frank, go ahead and finish up your point, my friend.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  Thank you. Well, I read this last night, the story of Khalid Saeed.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  This is in Egypt. He's a 28-year-old activist blogger.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  And Egypt's been under an emergency law for 30 years.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  Yeah, they came in and beat him to death with clubs in front of everyone
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  and just said, what are you going to do about it?
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  Yeah, they smashed his brain against a handrail and for 20 minutes until he died.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  And because he was going to upload a video showing police corruption.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  And Jed and I are bringing a child into this world.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  And my question to you, Alex, is what lessons do we as a people need to instill in our children
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  so that they will stand up against the Stasi regime, against the secret...
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  Well, what happens is, this is the lesson.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  Cops, in every case and culture, the enforcers of the Imperium, they recruit and promote the thugs, the bullies,
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  the false macho, the fake tough and the crazy brave.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  And then they all get into a mob psychology of one upping each other.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  And Drudge Report linked to a video that we posted yesterday of Canadians singing the Canadian National Anthem.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  And the police line up and then charge them and don't give them any warning
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  and beat them senseless and attack reporters.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  And then I saw Neocon commenters saying, good, beat them hippies, I love it, beat them, beat them, beat them.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  Well, I saw close-ups of that crowd.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  They were men, they were children, they were, as the London Guardian said, a, quote, middle-class crowd.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  Not that it was a poor crowd, they deserve it, or a hippie crowd.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  But this was Canadians against the G20, looting them, foreign bankers trying to raise everybody's taxes, criminal group.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  And there were comment after comment, and I would link on for about 10 minutes, I would link through to their profiles.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  And they were cops, they were military veterans, and they were there cheering.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  These are mainline conservatives going to the Drudge Report.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  Drudge linked to it because he's disgusted by it.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  I know that because he linked to other articles by the Guardian reporting on just how brutal this was and how evil and how they witnessed it.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  I mean, these are top reporters for the equivalent of the New York Times being polite and cops saying, stand him up and just punching him and punching him.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  And cops in Canada all the time kill people in airports, beat them to death, that happens here.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  And so this, we're going to have more of this.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  We have no future unless we stand up and stop dehumanizing people.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  Because that's what these people were doing on the YouTube video was good.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  I love seeing hippies getting beaten.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  I remember that military tape I played where the guys watching the kids getting beaten in Iraq and he's going, yes, yes.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  Oh, I love it.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  Did you ever hear that audio?
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  Oh, yeah.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  So it's a similar thing.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  They were like, yes, yes on the YouTube with their comments.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  You could hear it in their text.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  Get them, get them.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  Oh, I love beating hippies.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  But number one, you need to know that in Spain, in Greece, in Iceland, they're trying to take the entire police pensions dummies.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  These bankers are not your friends.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  And even the AP is showing video of plainclothes men grabbing men, women and children and putting them in black vans.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  What do I always say?
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  They have bills introduced worldwide to allow snatch and grab to go on like this is Turkmenistan or something.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  And now they're showing you snatch and grabs everywhere to acclimate you just like they showed you SWAT teams 30 years ago to acclimate you.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  Or they kicked off the Black Stormtrooper uniforms in Seattle 11 years ago.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  We are all being bathed and conditioned.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  The cops, the citizens, everyone, so we can live like they do in Egypt.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  And just when the cops want to, they'll take their slow time beating your brains out because they're in charge.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  They're tough.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  They made it in life.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  They've got government authority.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  And none of our children are safe.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  None of us are safe until we say no to this, until we take our governments back, until we take our cities and counties and states back and say no.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  You will not turn the police into Doverman pensions that rip our throats out.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  You will not at the G20 in Pittsburgh release police dogs on old women coming out of stores with grocery sacks saying there's a daytime curfew and then attacking them with a police dog.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  They put that on the news to make you understand this is the new America.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  They are now grabbing people who are innocent.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000]  There's video after video after video up on prisonplanet.com and article Steve Watson wrote.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  I forget the headline.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  You guys will be news in focus now or may have already rotated off the front page.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  Steve Watson an article about people being snatched off the road.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  There's a whole bunch of videos there.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  And when you click on each video it takes you to YouTube with dozens of other videos literally beside each one of just black vans running around just grabbing people.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  Peaceful, personal, have a flower.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  Officers were humans.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  They just run out and grab her and hand them to plain clothes contractors that throw them in vans.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  Total tyranny as private contractors wearing masks or grabbing people.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  I mean this is just a giant feeding frenzy of evil training the police and military to go door to door and start the real mass arrest.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  And we'll just lovingly go get in their vans and go to the labor camp because after all their officers and we've got to do whatever they say.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000]  I mean this is it.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000]  Hi folks this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000]  Not detergents but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin soap company.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000]  A family owned and operated American company.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  My family, staff, friends and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry and dishes.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:23.000]  There is nothing like these factory direct big money saving triple concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  Get a free detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000]  Let's talk to the owner of 5star soap Marty Schachter and see what he has to say.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  As founder and owner for over 63 years people keep asking me how's business?
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:31:00.000]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain. Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler. Thank you.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.000]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:30.000]  The silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:40.000]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:45.000]  Very easy to follow step by step instructions are provided making production fast and simple.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:59.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the silver lungs generator. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar powered generator.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:14.000]  Number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:20.000]  It's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:28.000]  Number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  Number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  Number five a solar powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.000]  Folks I really believe in the solar powered generators offered by Solutions from Science one of my old sponsors.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:51.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:33:00.000]  Remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:18.000]  Okay I'm going to continue with your phone calls. We've got two guests coming up in the last hour.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  Constitutional lawyer scholar Larry B. Crafts talk about the makeup of the Supreme Court and Elena Kagan aka the Penguin.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  So I was wrong yesterday to call her a demonic pelican. It's a demonic penguin.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  In fact later on in this we'll show you an image of the Batman movie Penguin character and I'm asking you is this not Elena Kagan.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  But it's wrong to make fun of her how she looks. It's her actions. So we've got a clip of her talking about the banning of books.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  So that is coming up and we're also going to talk to a member of the Icelandic Parliament who's the spokesperson for WikiLeaks members who are in hiding being hunted by the Pentagon.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:14.000]  Yes what a strange world we live in but I do want to go back to your phone calls while we're talking because we are now simulcasting live at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  I'm going to just show you some of the videos without audio of your prisonplanet.tv viewer.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  If you're a radio listener you can go to prisonplanet.com and read the article Steve Watson did about it, about activists being grabbed by plainclothes goons and thrown into vans.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  And they're just pulling up and grabbing and beating people up for no reason and throwing them into unmarked vans and speeding away to set the precedent to have private security goons out arresting you.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  And Canada passed a secret emergency law to allow this. Of course no law was passed in Pittsburgh but they just did it.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  So and there's video of them singing Canada O Canada and being run over by the police including a London Guardian reporter who was beaten.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  And they were told I'm beating you because someone burned cars two days ago. Yes that's on record. I'm beating you because someone did that.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  And black vans grabbing people as part of a Psyop. I mean this is all part of training everyone police and everyone else that now unmarked vans grab you and you go bye bye just as Lieberman and McCain have bills introduced with the headlines.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  Citizens to be secretly arrested no court no due process enhanced interrogation to be used. You just disappear into a black hole for ever.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  Instead of the song about school town for ever no more pencils no more teachers now it's the Constitution and freedoms out for ever no more private property no more second amendment tyranny is here for ever.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  Unless we let them get away with this. By the way everybody's emailing me going Alex the headline says that Supreme Court extends second amendment rights.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  But then the footnote is but for the first time the High Court ruled there could be restrictions under law.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  The politicians say I believe the second amendment accepted prescribed by law. That's why the gun grabber groups have hailed it because now yeah in places like Chicago they may let you get a permit if you jump through 100 hoops.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  But nationwide now they can pass unconstitutional laws restricting and violating what's happening in Texas Arizona and Vermont.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  Okay I'm done let's go to your calls who's up next here Dave in Arizona Dave you're on the air.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  Hi Alex thank you for taking my call.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  Good sir good to have you here thanks for calling.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  Are you familiar with the world peace project.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  I had rings a bell somewhere.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  Okay well the world peace project has done studies all over the world what they've done a study in Washington DC in 1993 where collectively a group of people got together and they prayed to reduce violent crime and they reduced violent crime by 23% in the district of
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  Columbia in that year in 1993 they have decades of scientific research that that show that this work that that this.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  Well there are major even atheistic studies they've done where they found attitudes around plants seem to have an effect music has an effect.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  And there's certainly a lot going on in the universe we don't understand.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  So what I would suggest Jesus said that in John 1412 that we would be able to do greater things than he did but he has to go to the father.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  So we're in that time where we are collectively will be able to do greater things than Christ did through his power.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  And what I would suggest is that since the Bible asked us to pray unceasingly that that I would ask everyone to start praying for the disruption of weapons in the hands of tyrants.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  Immediately that means disrupt their computers disrupt their communications disrupt their electronics disrupt their ammunition disrupt their vehicles when they try to snatch someone off the street and throw them in the car.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  And that's why I say four flat tires or or the electronics doesn't work.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  I'm telling you that this is going to work.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  This is what we're going to have to do Alex and that this is going to work guaranteed because the scriptures say it will work.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  Well I'll just leave it in God's court.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  I'm going to stand up physically in the info war on this plane of existence and warn people and put myself in harm's way and do whatever I can to try to point out what's happening.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  The way that God gives us divine intervention and providence and that tyranny be confused and that tyrants fail and that God's will be done upon them.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  And I'm asking God you know to and of course the you know history shows you need to ask God to come in you need to ask for the help.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  And I think that is an important prayer to put out there you know George Washington did it and I'm doing it today.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  And I appreciate your call day very interesting very profound thought there for those that just joined us back at the start of the show an hour ago an hour and thirty nine minutes ago I said I want to hear profound statements today from callers.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  I'd like to hear what you believe is profound what you believe the world is really all about.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  I know this what we pray for what we dream about is what our mind then imagines and then what what we manifest in 1900.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  Max Plank as I started the show talking about the German physicist envisioned nuclear quantum and atoms and splitting the atom and by nineteen eighteen he'd written complex equations on it.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  And by nineteen thirty four other physicists had had had already written out nuclear reactors they never split the atom yet.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  And then by nineteen thirty nine they split the atom and you know the rest is history that's what the human mind can do.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  We envisioned airplanes three hundred years ago we have them.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  We envisioned spacecraft we have them we've envisioned particle accelerators we have them.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  We envision black holes with mathematics the satellite telescopes have found them.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  I mean the human mind is unbelievably powerful.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  That's why the globalists are always telling you you're weak you're pathetic you don't have any power because they are adept at power they understand the power.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  They're tuned into the secrets of the world that's handed down by their societies over millennium.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  They know things that you know I don't know and all I do is research this but from the outside and the information I know I can barely deal with and barely understand.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  Imagine these people but they've made the decision to use all this knowledge to totally dominate society and their fellow man.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:54.000]  I'm saying use knowledge to empower humanity and to believe in humanity not to dumb humanity down.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  But I've always wanted to give always I've always wanted to create these people are twisted and they use their knowledge for evil.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  Everett in Florida you're on the air Everett.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  Yes thank you Alex.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  You make a lot of great films all the pieces of the puzzle are out there the truth is out there.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  But but if I may humbly and respectfully make this observation.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  My observation is that if you tell people the air the food the water their minds are being poisoned and bankers in New World Order and all that stuff.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  It isn't immediately tangible to them they don't see it how it directly affects them right now.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  But I believe if you make the one film that will sell more than Avatar if you make it with you being the person to make it.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  You'll be able to cut off the root of the New World Order's existence and supply which is the source of their plans to enslave us.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  I believe that if you make a film exposing the individual income tax that is tangible and it is undeniable.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  Well you know that was a lost opportunity Aaron Russo called me over and over again.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  And I had such a small staff at the time for some reason I didn't even contact him back he tried for a year to interview me for his film freedom to fascism.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  But I still promoted it once it came out and that was a lost opportunity to be in that film.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  And I've exposed the comprehensive annual financial report 12 years ago with a with a film.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  And I guess I could make a documentary about the income tax but I think American freedom to fascism has done a pretty good job at that.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  Yes but I think more detail needs to be shown like the truth of it and as a matter of fact in less than probably 20 seconds.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  I can start people down the rabbit hole if you'll allow me just 20 seconds to say sure show something.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  Thank you. If everybody out there will go get a copy of the internal revenue code or go to their accountant or their attorney and ask them for a copy of the internal revenue code.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  Turn to the back of it which will have blue pages called the topical index and look at liability for tax under L obviously.
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  You'll see all the taxes that there's a legal liability for gift tax railroad taxes tobacco taxes etc. You will not see individual income tax.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  Because there is no lawful liability for it. It's not listed.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  Well I mean I have to tell people that there's a lot of fake remedies that are put out there by patriot people that aren't a silver bullet to get you out of the income tax.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:54.000]  I'm not saying that the income tax is legitimate. It's not. It's a complete fraud. It's a hoax.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  It's on record in the book. The law whatever was they went to all 44 states that were in existence in 1913 when they got the 17th amendment and the income tax.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:13.000]  And the majority of the states that they said ratified at their own annual show they didn't ratify it.
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:22.000]  So it was a hoax. Most states weren't in session but every two years and it just got announced and falsely ratified.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  The two thirds of the states did not do it. Not even a third did it.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:30.000]  And we built our whole country without it. We've now had it 97 years and look what it's done to us.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.000]  But it wasn't even popular or used widely until the mid 50s.
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  When they passed the income tax it was such a small tax that it was only on people making over a million dollars a year and very few were doing that.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:50.000]  And so the elites themselves were the ones that pushed it and they had loopholes where they didn't have to pay it.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  And yes it's all goes to interest on the debt, interest to the Federal Reserve, to Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and others.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  The big six banks of course are JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citibank, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and what's the other one that will pop in my head in a minute.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  I mean those are the Federal Reserve shareholding banks and so it's a very important point you've raised and it's a complete fraud.
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  And now we're about to have a new banker tax, the carbon tax that is to be paid directly to the international organization and combine.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  So I appreciate your call and I do need to make a film on that subject. I appreciate it.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  Okay let's go ahead now and talk to Brian in Pennsylvania. You're on the air.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  Hey Alex, how's it going? Hey you're asking for a profound statement today. I just want to try to add on to that and then add a little story about the X-Tex bill after that if there's time.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  I just want to give a shout out to that guy in his tomato garden right now because that is what you're supposed to be doing in life.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  Find peace outside, find peace with yourself. That's all that we're here for.
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  But anyway, I figuratively woke up as you would call it a few months ago.
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  I used to find pleasure in watching our military triumph different places in the world.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  I used to think that we're spreading justice, we're doing this, we're doing that.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  And that was you winning the victory. You were having the triumph.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  It's almost as if it becomes an extension of your soul. It's sickening. It's like you're out there and you're defeating these defenseless people.
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:44.000]  They have no concerns of us. We're there to change their perception on culture.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  Kids fighting tanks with rocks are dirtbag roaches who are cowards and the people in tanks running them over are heroes.
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:59.000]  That's exactly right. It's very perverted and I hope that nobody can tell you to see this.
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:12.000]  And for me, discredit me if it must be, but I had a psychedelic experience and after that it was the equivalent of having a bucket of cold water on Tommy while I was in bed.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  On record, the CIA in the 1940s and 50s with LSD, the owners of Timelife books were big LSD heads, very wealthy.
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  These Coastal Leech, Scull and Bones was taking it. This has all been released.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  And they decided this is something that's good to give the general public to bring them into our new order.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  But then they decided in the studies that this is backfiring on us and so banned this substance. But the CIA admittedly delivered in the early 60s and on pure LSD to campuses all over the country.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  They told professors that were CIA, give this to your students and they then put out the ingredients, the recipe for LSD.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  And then by 1970, and there's been reports on this, you can pull them up, the government said, what have you done? This is actually backfiring. Get them off this stuff.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  And hallucinogens are very dangerous. I'm not telling people to go out and take them, but somebody who's under heavy mind control and they did have some studies in the 60s.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  People have been abused. Sometimes it helped them, you know, get out of those paradigms of fear that they were in.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  I mean, it can really remake you. The problem is most hallucinogens out there now are just toxic waste that they call those hallucinogens.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  Because the basic precursor drugs or chemicals you need to make them are so controlled that they have to mix a lot of other ingredients in to be able to get the molecular structure.
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  And then there's a lot of excess heavy metals and grignard reagents and toxins and chemicals in there.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  You know, it's the same thing with many drugs. These street drugs are very dirty, so no one should take hallucinogens.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  But from my research and what I've seen and studied is that an altered state can, with someone who's been conditioned, break their conditioning.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  It could just as easily put you deeper into the conditioning or make you have a psychotic break and eat your fingers or jump off a cliff.
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  Now, most people that take LSD today are taking a weak version of it and they're not taking a lot of it.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  And so it's more like speed. But if you take real LSD, I've read from the research studies that have been done, that yes, it can certainly open up.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  I mean, that's what the Bible talks about. Pharma, Kea, the sorcerers, you know, they would take drugs that would open them up.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  And the Bible says that's dangerous and bad, so I go with that.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  But yes, certainly can do that. I appreciate your call. Very, very dangerous though.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  Real high-powered hallucinogens where you see pink elephants and things or puff the magic dragon are extremely dangerous.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  Let's go ahead and take another phone call here. Let's talk to who's up first here.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  Annie in Indiana, you're on the air, Annie.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  Yes, Alex. I've called several times before. I'm a Texan in exile in Indiana.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  Welcome.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  Thank you. It's amazing that some of us are like you, are going through a review in our lives now that we're getting close to the end times of the purpose of life.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  In the 60s, I was a radical. I did civil rights work, NAACP, demonstrated against the war.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  My heroes were Bob Dylan and Joan Baez.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  In 74, I became a Christian and I started becoming a serious Bible student.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  I asked the Lord if he would let me live to see the end times. I would consider it the greatest gift.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  And I'd like to tell people, be careful what you pray for because you may get it.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  Well, I mean, it certainly things are getting wild. I mean, they're trying to gear up for World War III.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  They're purposely letting the oil spill come in via the hurricanes, blocking relief efforts.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  They are poisoning the food and water.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  And it's just a fact, you know, it shocks people. Stay there. Finish up with what you had to say, Annie. We come back.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers

[01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  Normal blood pressure, naturally. How would that make you feel?
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  I'm Don from New Mexico. January of 2000, I had a heart attack. Then my real health began going downhill,
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  My health was a mess, pretty much.
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.000]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.000]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of heart and body extract.
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  Order at HBextract.com, or call 866-295-5305. That's HBextract.com, or call 866-295-5305.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  Folks, I did not expect this at all. About a seventh, eighth, and ninth day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking heart and body extract.
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  Details at HBextract.com, or call 866-295-5305 for heart and body extract.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  Alright, I said I was going to get to this Kagan situation before our guest comes home.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  We've got five minutes now, five minutes in that first little segment before a member of Icelandic Parliament joins us.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  So I'm going to get to the Kagan here in a moment.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  Going back to Annie, I am a Christian, and I believe in God and the devil, I believe in these forces in the universe.
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  I've experienced it, and I know there's providence, but I don't believe in what the man-made church has said.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  That's why I'm not part of any Protestant or Catholic or any organization.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  I am someone who follows Christ, and I can feel God. I can literally feel the energy source.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  I have a relationship, and I've had experiences I won't get into on air in my life that are just unbelievable.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  I don't need to take LSD to hook up with God.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  I'm tied into the universe, and we all are. I'm not saying I'm special here.
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  I've had private experiences that are mine, and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  I mean, I've literally...
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  Oh, it didn't matter. You've all experienced it, and you ignore it.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  It's hidden in plain view.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  There's such a wider universe going on around you, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  and you're told to just focus on TV and just focus on the men on suits and limit your perspective.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  And so I've limited what I cover here to what we can 100% prove,
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  but I know there's a lot more going on in the world.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  And the global system, everything they do is about limiting your consciousness,
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  limiting your view, limiting your horizon, where it's a shrunken view of the world you have
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  down to just a tiny little pinpoint of whatever information they're feeding you.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  That's what they want. They want you with blinders on.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  But I see a very destructive force in the church in the last 150 years with the Scofield Bible
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  and things that came after it, where they say it's the end of the world.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  Christians are to just bunker in their houses and wait for the end of the world,
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  and the worse things get, that's better because Jesus is coming.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  If you really read the Old Testament, New Testament, it's all about fighting evil,
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  standing up against corruption, standing up for innocence, widows and orphans and children,
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  and standing up against the kings of the earth and the corrupt priest,
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  who are always there working with the system to limit your relationship with creation,
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  your relationship with God, okay?
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  And so all I'm trying to get people to do is to think for themselves
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  and to realize that is God going to let somebody into Valhalla, into heaven,
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  who knew there was evil going on, but copped out and ran and hid?
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  I'm not saying you're doing that. You sound like a great lady, Annie.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  They could fire up the Hadron Collider next month and destroy the whole earth.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  They admit the Mathematic Equations show that that's a small possibility.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  Just like Mathematical Equations in 1900 showed they could build atomic bombs and nuclear reactors.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  And it could happen. Genetic engineering could get out of control next week,
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  and this could happen.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  I mean, yes, the globalists are moving headlong towards things that statistically say
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  we're going to have mass calamities and possibly total destruction.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  I mean, never before has man had powers to be able to turn the sea into something that's dead
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.000]  or to be able to burn up a third of the earth or kill a third of the people
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  or for the Antichrist to be seen worldwide at once by everyone on the planet.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:58.000]  You know, through the air, communicating, his image projected worldwide and in the temple.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:04.000]  I mean, yes, it's heavy stuff. It's not Nostradamus vague baloney. It's very specific.
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  But regardless of what's coming and what's happening, is God going to like somebody
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  who knows it's going on, who doesn't have courage, who doesn't speak up?
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  Finish your point quickly, because I've got to go to break and come back with the next hour, Annie.
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:20.000]  This is where the Lord had told me to speak about standing up for the voiceless,
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  the widows, the orphans and the unborn.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  Oh, really? Is that what you were going to say?
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:33.000]  That's what I was going to say. You saw my thunder and I wanted to say, can I hold?
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  Well, I'll tell you what, stay there, because I don't want to cut you off again.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000]  Stay there. We're going to come back and make your point,
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  because I can tell you're breaking up there a little bit, Chuck.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:45.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:59.000]  Terany is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:02.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:07.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:12.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.000]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.000]  has established an old powerful shadow state.
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:24.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:34.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:38.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:45.000]  The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at infowars.com

[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:22.000]  On the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:27.000]  Man, we're two hours in. I haven't even played this on Lana Kagan before the Supreme Court clip about it.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  Yes, the government can ban books. We do have that on the books, but we're not going to do it right now.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  And I've now got her thesis, the final conflict, socialism in New York City,
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:46.000]  why the socialists couldn't take over, but why they should and how socialism's good.
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:51.000]  Remember, they blocked Hillary's thesis and it got released last year, and she praises Lenin in it.
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:58.000]  I mean, Lenin was a mass murderer. So we're going to be covering that coming up at Larry Beacraft.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:06.000]  But, Annie, finishing up your point about God and the state of the world and the end times. Go ahead.
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  Okay. Well, since my radical days of protesting in the 60s, I've told myself to pick your battles.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  And if you're going to go down, make sure it counts for something.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  But reviewing my life and the purpose of life, if you were saying I've come to see my old age,
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  then that's just a cowardly excuse for not standing up.
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  And I'd like to tell young people, stand up every chance you get and scream your head off at any injustice.
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  Don't tell yourself to be quiet. Pick your battles and wait because the chance may not come again.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  And I want to say I'm so proud of the young Chinese in Tiananmen Square and the young people in Canada recently for standing up.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:46.000]  All people should have done it a long time ago, and they wouldn't have to if we had done our job.
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:50.000]  Absolutely. Take care. We're going to go to more calls coming up.
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  But I want to play this now, and I'll play it again towards the end of the hour and fully get into it.
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:58.000]  I meant to last hour, so I want to play it now. Here it is, Kagan's own words.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  It's fine if the law bans books because government won't really enforce it.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  And before we play it, here's the Reading Eagle article.
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:16.000]  This has also been in the Associated Press that Bruce Shore sent an email to Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky.
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:24.000]  He saw him on C-SPAN and was angered when Bunning complained that, gosh, he had missed the Kentucky South Carolina basketball game
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  because he had to be in Congress to debate an unemployment benefits bill.
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  I was livid. I was just livid. Recall the 51-year-old Shore. I'm on unemployment, so it affects me.
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:40.000]  And in the indictment from the grand jury, this is the part that got him arrested and charged with felonies.
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  Are you all insane? No checks equal no food for me. Do you get it?
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  And for calling them insane, he violated the subsection of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  And the subsection is Communication Act 1934 subsection that says, Shore did utilize a telecommunications device.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  That is a computer, whether or not communication ensued without disclosing his identity
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  and with the intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person who received the communication.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:26.000]  And in the indictment, it says he annoyed. So annoying. See, oh, it'd been on the book for 14 years
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:30.000]  that they could throw you in prison if you annoyed someone and they decided they were annoyed.
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  Now they're just now using it. So Elena Kagan, I don't know if I have time to play it now.
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  Start playing it. We'll just go out to break with this. Here it is.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  If Congress could say no TV and radio ads, could it also say no newspaper ads, no campaign biographies?
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  The government's view is that although 441B does cover full length books, that there would be a quite good as applied challenge
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  to any attempt to apply 441B in that context. And I should say that the FEC has never applied 441B in that context.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  So for 60 years, a book has never been at issue.
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  What happened to the overbred doctrine? I mean, I thought our doctrine in the First Amendment is if you write it too broadly,
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  we're not going to pair it back to the point where it's constitutional. If it's overbred, it's invalid. What happened to that?
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  I don't think that it would be substantially overbred, Justice Scalia.
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  If I tell you that the FEC has never applied this statute to a book, to say that it doesn't apply to books is to take off, you know,
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:45.000]  essentially nothing from the start of...
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  That's enough. We'll play it in its entirety, unedited, near the end of the hour, but you hear the spin.
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  Well, I'm not going to remove the part that we can ban books, because we've never decided to do that.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:01.000]  But we're going to keep that power, though, because we like it. We're thugs.
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:41.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.000]  How much do you want all you can get? I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:51.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633,

[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.000]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.000]  Okay, this is breaking exclusive information.
[02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:17.000]  We are eight minutes into the third hour today.
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:23.000]  Brigitte Jones-Dottier, who led the charge in the Icelandic parliament to say no
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:26.000]  to the Goldman Sachs looting of her country.
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:30.000]  They've successfully seized Greece at selling them derivatives.
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:35.000]  They've also got it through their parliament to create a media haven for internet freedom.
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000]  We'll talk about that weather.
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:40.000]  They just had a conference in Europe dealing with the persecution of free speech.
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:43.000]  I just covered mainstream news in the U.S. where there are arresting people
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:47.000]  that send emails to senators who annoy them.
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000]  You get charged with felonies.
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000]  So that is going on.
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:55.000]  But Brigitte Jones-Dottier joins us, and we're really honored to have her.
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:01.000]  She's a member of the Icelandic parliament for the movement party group chairperson.
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  And we really appreciate her coming on.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  She's on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Environmental Committee,
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  EU Application Committee, Truth Commission Committee, and the NATO Committee.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:15.000]  Brigitte Jones-Dottier became a member in 2009 and is now a worldwide leader
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  known for standing up for freedom.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.000]  Also, when she was on with us last year for the first time,
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:25.000]  I noticed that Julian Assaj, if I'm pronouncing that right,
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  the founder of WikiLeaks was in the background.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  Jeremy was pointing out, I think the WikiLeaks founder is in her house.
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000]  Yeah, there he is.
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  And then now, of course, he's internationally sought.
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  The Pentagon admits they have a task force out.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:44.000]  The Pentagon paper, Daniel Ellsberg, told MSNBC
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  that he had a hit team out trying to kill him
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:50.000]  and that he believes there may be a Pentagon hit team out.
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:53.000]  That's been declassified with the Pentagon papers,
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:56.000]  trying to go after the WikiLeaks founder.
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  And he put out an email two weeks ago saying she is now basically his spokesman.
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.000]  And so we're talking to her and she did work with him.
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.000]  She can say on the Helicopter Slaughter video in Baghdad,
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  he's reportedly got hundreds of other things he could release.
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000]  And I said to her during the break, I said,
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  look, Burgeet, especially you, intelligent, lovely, smart, dynamic,
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000]  we want you to stay alive.
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000]  You guys better release everything you got and quick.
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000]  And she said, I agree.
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  So we'll hear that in her own words.
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.000]  Good to have you here with us.
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000]  Well, good to be back.
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:31.000]  Okay.
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  I mean, let's go through this, your relationship to WikiLeaks,
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  who Julian is for those that, I mean, he's the guy on television in the black suit
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  with a red tie and the blonde platinum hair folks, the founder of WikiLeaks.
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  I mean, how this saga has been unfolding.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  Give us basically a boil down and then let's start wherever you like.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:49.000]  Okay.
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  Well, WikiLeaks became instantly famous in Iceland in August last year
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  when there was a junction on a story that they had actually leaked.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:04.000]  It wasn't a junction on our national television, not to broadcast the news of WikiLeaks.
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000]  It was a loan book from one of the big banks.
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  So instead of saying nothing, the broadcaster decided to put a picture of the website on the TV
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  and the URL that's all about it there.
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:22.000]  So they became instantly known here and very well thought of.
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:29.000]  In December, I was invited to speak at the conference about the freedom
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  and WikiLeaks were there also here after they came to the university.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:38.000]  And they were introducing or discussing an idea about the oppressed haven
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:48.000]  or sort of taking the idea behind tax havens and reversing it into transparency havens.
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:53.000]  Birgit, I hate to bug you, but your Skype was down today or we couldn't connect to Iceland
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:58.000]  and your cell phone is, I can hear you, but I've got to really focus.
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  Can you try putting the receiver closer to your mouth?
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000]  Yes, this is better.
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:06.000]  John, that's better, isn't it?
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  Yeah, keep going.
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000]  Okay.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  So I approached them and said, you know, coming from the background of being a writer, journalist, activist,
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  and one of the pioneers in bringing the internet to Iceland, I approached them and I said,
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  let's do this because I understood the scope of it and I understood that every day,
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:34.000]  the basic rights that we sort of take for granted when it comes to freedom of information,
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:41.000]  freedom of expression and speech are being carefully eroded from us.
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  And like in the UK they have used, and in Europe in general, they have used the anti-terrorist act
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:54.000]  to chip away this freedom at such a pace that people don't really realize
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:58.000]  how much of these freedoms have been taken away from us.
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:05.000]  And now they've started with all these filtering using child pornography filters as the reason
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:10.000]  for filtering out all sorts of stuff, including legally, just for today.
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:15.000]  Well, large wireless networks all over Europe, BlockInfoWars.com and PrismPlanet.com,
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:18.000]  Paul Watson's written stories about that and they admit in Australia,
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:22.000]  their Chinese net style censorship program, for those who just joined us,
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:26.000]  admittedly will use government software to track what you're looking at
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:33.000]  and blocking things from pro-life groups to environmental groups to local dentists in Australia.
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  And we now know that they have the Cybersecurity Act to do the same thing here in the United States
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:42.000]  and the FCC says you'll have a black box at the ISP and in your home.
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000]  So this is really happening.
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  This has to be stopped because if we don't have access to information,
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  how in the world are both the general public and legislators going to be able to take enlightened decisions?
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  Based on reality.
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:03.000]  I mean, just like what's happening in the U.K. is that they have passed all these
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  sovereign junctions, meaning that journalists cannot tell that they can't tell the story.
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000]  I think this is very serious.
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  Yeah, they call that a de-notice in England for those that don't know.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:17.000]  You may see a cop murder someone and they'll just issue a de-notice.
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000]  They're issuing a lot more of them now.
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  And similarly, here in the U.S. cops will say you can't videotape what they're doing 100 yards away
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000]  and they'll arrest you even though there's no law.
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  They claim it's wiretapping when there's no perception of privacy.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  So there's a real tyranny here against the new media and the old media is in trouble in losing its viewers and readers.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  So it's teaming up with government and corrupt corporations in a perfect storm
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:46.000]  and openly selling to shut down the true Internet.
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:55.000]  Well, we have to fight this on all fronts and the Atlantic Modern Media Initiative, this proposal that I managed to pass to the parliament with unanimous vote.
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  On June 16th, even the government started, is an attempt to sort of put the foot down
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:10.000]  and also to create a dialogue about what is really going on when it comes to the new media
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:15.000]  because most of the media is moving on to the Internet and if we don't deal with the reality
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  and deal with all these weak laws after so many of these legislations are being destroyed.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  If we don't stand up now, it's going to be just like radio 80 years ago when governments took that over
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  and restricted the ban. For those that don't know, there's a much wider ban.
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  There should be much more community involvement.
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  But with the Internet, there's an unlimited spectrum of space
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:46.000]  and they're artificially openly saying, I mean, White House regulations are,
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.000]  Cass Sunstein openly says he wants to restrict free speech.
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  Well, I really encourage everybody that care about these things to start the dialogue.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:16:04.000]  I have been actually amazed by the reaction that I've got to this proposal just as I found it in February.
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:10.000]  And this idea could spread, just like your idea to have free zones for true Internet freedom
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:13.000]  versus everybody becoming like China.
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:16.000]  You're offering the alternative of everybody becoming like Iceland,
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.000]  just like you're an example of standing up against the bankers.
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:27.000]  Well, if you can see Icelandic modern media initiative, the MA into the international modern media initiative.
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  So I think I'm offering this, Iceland can be the icebreaker. We can pass this, or I'm not suggesting,
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:39.000]  or asking the government to change 13 different laws and put this in ministry.
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:45.000]  And once we put all that in place, and there's in particular a very, very important aspect of this as well,
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:50.000]  and that is we are bringing together all the best legislation from around the world
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:54.000]  in order to create this safe haven for not only journalists, but for...
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:59.000]  Brigida, respectfully, I want to give you the floor and have you get into that positive thing.
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  But you've got a lot of courage, and let's just get it on record here,
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:07.000]  that Daniel Ellsberg, very well respected, said that we're hit teams issued to kill him.
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:11.000]  He thinks you guys are in physical danger with WikiLeaks.
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:17.000]  You are the spokesman right now for Julian Assange, and he is being hunted.
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:23.000]  He just put out an email today through you and through others that he is going back into complete hiding.
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  And the Pentagon says he is being hunted by them, and he's about to release all this.
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:34.000]  Can we talk about that first, about your role in releasing the copter murder video?
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000]  We'll play some of that in the background.
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:42.000]  And then give us any idea on what it is he's about to release that's got the Pentagon so scared.
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:49.000]  I mean, they've arrested the military officer that released this and are still holding him with no lawyers right now.
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:57.000]  Well, just to clarify, Julian Assange, I just acted as a spokesperson for him while he was in hiding in Australia.
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:05.000]  He has appeared now. He appeared in Brussels last week when we both were attending a seminar at the European Parliament
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:08.000]  discussing freedom of expression in Europe.
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:14.000]  So if people want to get hold of him, they can just do that directly through email and stuff like that.
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:18.000]  Well, we've been trying to get a hold of him, and he's emailed us back a few times.
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:22.000]  Can you put in a good word to him to get him to come on this show?
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:31.000]  But, you know, I really, I don't feel that I'm an imminent danger.
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  Or, you know, the reason why Julian has been undercover is to being, you know, using common sense and being cautious.
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  We don't want to make it easy for the bastards to use it onwards.
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:55.000]  But I think it is, it will be, it will shake the world for the next stuff that comes out of the meeting.
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:02.000]  I also want to stress that when it comes to Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier that is in detention in Kauai,
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:07.000]  that has been in detention for four weeks without being charged.
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  There is a complete catch-22 when it comes to getting him off the lawyers. A military lawyer appointed to him.
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:23.000]  He can't get the lawyers that Wichilis has been assigned for him because he has to ask for it,
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:27.000]  but he can't, nobody can give him the information that these lawyers have...
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:28.000]  Well, I mean, why...
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:33.000]  We've got to go to break. This is incredible info, but you say the next information will shake the world.
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:37.000]  Are you implying it's much bigger than the copter massacre?
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000]  Uh, maybe.
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  Maybe?
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:46.000]  All right, stay there, stay there. I'm on the edge of my seat here.
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:50.000]  And the Pentagon says it's thousands of documents and videos.
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:57.000]  So, Lord knows what treasure trove you guys have got, and anything to end these wars as soon as possible.
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:04.000]  I think you underestimate how much danger you're in, though.

[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:03.000]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:07.000]  Are we going to see economic growth? Slide into a recession or at worst, depression?
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:10.000]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:15.000]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:18.000]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S. Treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:23.000]  But what do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:28.000]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:33.000]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold,
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:38.000]  discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full color illustrations, weights and measures.

[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:05.000]  They help to create a new world order. We are part of a new world order.
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:08.000]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:13.000]  Invisible Empire is a gamming indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:18.000]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:26.000]  The United Nations would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:34.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:39.000]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:42.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:48.000]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:07.000]  And the explanation he used was that he was understood that it was not safe for him to come to this country.
[02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:14.000]  He left it and then later he explained now when the Bradley Manning arrest was announced he said now you understand why it didn't come.
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:20.000]  I think it's worth mentioning a very new and ominous development in our country.
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:26.000]  I think he would not be safe even physically entirely wherever he is.
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:33.000]  We have after all for the first time that I ever perhaps in any democratic country.
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:44.000]  We have a president who has announced that he feels he has the right to use special operations opportunities against anyone abroad that he thinks is associated with terrorism.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:50.000]  And that includes American citizens, one American citizen.
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:54.000]  Julian Assange is who Daniel Ellsberg was talking about there on MSNBC.
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  And for the last two, three weeks the spokesman he designated is Brigitte Jones-Dottier, the prestigious and very effective member of the Icelandic parliament.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000]  Plenty of time for her to break everything down.
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000]  We were able to get her via video Skype.
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.000]  We'll see how long that holds.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:17.000]  Okay, sorry you got cut off by the break. Briefly, the point you were trying to make about this shaking the world, the new information.
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:21.000]  Can you give us any idea when it's coming out or why he hasn't released it yet?
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:25.000]  Because, I mean, they're arresting people, they're tracking people down.
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:28.000]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:36.000]  Well, first of all, I want to stress that there is no proof that links Manning to Wikileaks.
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  There is only this log from Adrian Lamo that looks like he is an FBI spoke.
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:54.000]  So, you know, I can't verify if Wikileaks has access to the documents that is claimed Manning leaked.
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:57.000]  I mean, we don't even know if Manning exists.
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:06.000]  But, you know, there will be releases very soon. There are some technical problems and so forth.
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  So, we just, or, you know, Wikileaks just wants to make sure to release it in a proper fashion so it gets the attention it deserves.
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:22.000]  But from what you say, it sounds like we're getting very, very close to this political bomb dropping.
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:26.000]  I certainly hope so. I can't wait myself.
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:30.000]  But you know what it is. You said it's going to shake the world.
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000]  Yeah, I know what it is.
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000]  Can you give us any hint?
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:37.000]  No. Sorry.
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:48.000]  We've seen reports that it deals with echelon spying, that it's also more massacre videos, drones, killing people in Afghanistan. Wrong?
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:52.000]  Some of that will be released soon, yes.
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.000]  Say that again. I'm sorry.
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:03.000]  Some of that will probably be released soon. But, you know, I have not been able to get hold of Junior for a while or other Wikileaks people.
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:07.000]  Oh, so you're saying, hold on. I mean, let me get this straight. You're saying there's lots of stuff coming out.
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:16.000]  So, we got some drones killing people. We've got some NSA spying info. Are you saying it's not just one thing. It's a whole bunch of things.
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:24.000]  Well, Wikileaks kept submitted, you know, regional documents, you know, every day, lots of them.
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  So, I'm not sure, you know, how the process is going to be, and I can't really answer for exactly what is going to be released.
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:40.000]  But there is certainly a lot of documents being submitted to Wikileaks every day, every week, every month, every year.
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000]  Well, Brigida, I've got to say it.
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:52.000]  It has to be, and it's very important, because what Wikileaks aims to do with every document is to verify if it is the real deal or not.
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  Brigida, I've got to say, I mean, you are like an Amazon goddess here. I mean, you are like Wonder Woman.
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:05.000]  I mean, with all the incredible, you're beating the banks. You got laws passed for an internet free zone where there's true freedom of the press.
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  You're in there in Wikileaks just devastating the New World Order. I tell you, I really admire you. I just want to say that right now.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:22.000]  Thank you. I'm just doing my best to help co-creat a reality that I want to live in, and I think that it is something every individual should try to do and aspire to do.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:32.000]  Well, you are changing reality, and it shows what a go-getter can do. Could you have imagined two years ago when you first got active that you would have individually had this much success working with others?
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:40.000]  Absolutely not. Not in my wildest dreams. I never aspired to be a politician just to get that clear.
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  And I think that it is time for ordinary activists to get into places of power to do and have maximum influence both inside and outside these sufferings.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  And it is very important to work closely with grassroots groups and not shape it into a traditional political party,
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:11.000]  but to really create a bridge between ordinary people and the institutes that shape the laws that affect our lives.
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:19.000]  Well, we're going to go to break-long segment coming up, and I consider and throw questions out all day, but I do want to get into the law that Iceland has passed,
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:25.000]  what that means for the rest of the world, how we can duplicate that, more of the attacks on free speech and the press,
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:31.000]  and anything else you think is important on the other side, not just Alex Jones asking his questions.
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:44.000]  Brigitte Jones-Dottier is our guest, member of the Icelandic parliament, one of the premier leaders for freedom of the press and for stopping the banking cartel and for sovereignty of nations.
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:50.000]  And she's instrumental in also keeping her country out of the euro. I mean, she is having a great effect.
[02:29:50.000 --> 02:30:00.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:08.000]  They helped to create a new world order. We are part of a new world order. A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:13.000]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:20.000]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities. It means all the world under their control.
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:26.000]  The United Nations would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:34.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:39.000]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:46.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20. So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:24.000]  Take my word for it. Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:30.000]  Since 1947, Calvin's soap company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:05.000]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:08.000]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:12.000]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:16.000]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:22.000]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:26.000]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:30.000]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:35.000]  We have the facts, we have the constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law.
[02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:40.000]  College is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:41.000]  Rise of the Republic.
[02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:46.000]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:56.000]  Don't Tread on Me. Order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139
[02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:21.000]  and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:27.000]  We're going back to Burkina-Jones-Dottier in this long segment and we're getting into the new Supreme Court nominee.
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:33.000]  The opposite of Burkina-Jones-Dottier, the opposite of Thomas Jefferson or George Washington,
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:39.000]  openly believes that the government can, quote, disappear, that's a quote, any speech they don't like,
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:46.000]  and that the government can have legislation on the books or regulations to ban books.
[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:51.000]  So we're going to be talking about that in the next hour. Before we go any further here today,
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:55.000]  I wanted to remind listeners that this radio show is funded by you.
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000]  We're not funded by big global corporations.
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:01.000]  We're not funded by the Fortune 500 or by the Ford Foundation.
[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:04.000]  We're funded by yourprisonplanet.tv memberships.
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:08.000]  We can watch the live radio show and living video color and see the archives,
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:13.000]  get a podcast that's 64-bit, not 32, read my book, Paul Watson's book,
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:16.000]  see all my new films first, download them in high quality.
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:20.000]  Many other films have been authorized to post at prisonplanet.tv like Camp FEMA,
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000]  featuring myself and many others.
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:27.000]  Don't tread on me, rise to the republic with states' rights and how to take our country back.
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:31.000]  And if you just do it like Burkina-Jones-Dottier did in Iceland,
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:34.000]  you can actually take your country back or your state back.
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000]  This has the battle plan.
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:40.000]  Jason Bermas' new Invisible Empire, a new older defined that shows who these globalists are,
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:43.000]  what their master plan is, it's so important.
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:48.000]  My film that covers the whole banking eugenics takeover, Fall of the Republic,
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:53.000]  such an important documentary, books that are available online at infowars.com
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000]  on the online video bookstore.
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:35:00.000]  Like Genetic Roulette, the documented health risk of genetically engineered foods.
[02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:04.000]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, total sterilization, cancer, you name it,
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000]  from the government's own studies around the world.
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:12.000]  This sucker is like a textbook, but written to be very easy to understand.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:16.000]  You may know all about the New World Order, but your friends, your family, your neighbors,
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000]  they need genetic roulette.
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  And then of course, we've got five new t-shirts out available at infowars.com
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000]  in the shopping carts as well.
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:30.000]  Two new legalized freedom shirts, great way to get out there and wake people up.
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:33.000]  Oh, and I almost forgot, I've got a few hundred of these left,
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:36.000]  and I think I'm gonna still carry it once they're gone, but when I reorder it,
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000]  I'm gonna stop offering the discount.
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  This book is $19.95. It's a New York Times bestseller.
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000]  It's $24.95 in stores.
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:47.000]  It's $19.95, and you get a free film of your choice,
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:50.000]  a free film that I've made, a DVD, free.
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:54.000]  So that's a $40 value for $19.95 at infowars.com.
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000]  I've only got a few hundred of these left.
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:01.000]  When I reorder, I'm not going to buy enough of them to get the big discount,
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:04.000]  so I'm gonna have to jack the price up on them a bit,
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:08.000]  so if you want to get them, now is the time, infowars.com.
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:13.000]  Okay, and it's also important to support organizations in your area,
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:16.000]  or if you're in Iceland, to support Brigitte Jones.tier
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000]  and to spread the word about what she's doing.
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:24.000]  Okay, enough of me, Brigitte, continuing here on other issues
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:27.000]  or recapping things that you think are important
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:30.000]  for people to know about worldwide that just tuned in.
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:35.000]  Yeah, well, I have to say, I had a very interesting week last week
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:40.000]  because I was invited to go to the European Parliament
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.000]  to speak about freedom of expression in Europe.
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:49.000]  It was an organization inside the EU Parliament called ALTE,
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:53.000]  which is sort of a collaboration between liberals and democrats.
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:59.000]  And it's amazing to hear how bad the situation is in Europe
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:02.000]  because Europe always tends to be, just like the United States,
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:05.000]  the cradle of democracy.
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  And at the same time, people are forgetting what the foundations of democracy is,
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:13.000]  and that is basically freedom of information, freedom of speech,
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000]  and freedom of expression.
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000]  If we don't have that, we have no freedom.
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:21.000]  And one thing that I have also figured out from just working as a legislator
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  is that the parliaments increasingly from the parliaments
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  that I have been looking at and the Icelandic one
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:34.000]  have given away their power to create laws into the hands of the ministries
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:38.000]  and who creates the laws in the ministries and the lawyers.
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:42.000]  So basically our free world has been taken over by lawyers,
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:46.000]  and I find that to be a little bit disturbing.
[02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:52.000]  And I find it to be extremely important that parliaments reclaim their powers as well
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:55.000]  because parliaments are supposed to be the spirits between,
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:59.000]  or reflection of the people that they are representing.
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:06.000]  And it is important that we do not have only professional politicians running the show.
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:12.000]  It is very important that ordinary people have a chance to reflect in a real way
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  the real people that they are supposed to be representing.
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:20.000]  Anyway, I met also about 10 days ago Bill Still.
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:23.000]  He was here in Iceland, I don't know if you know who he is,
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:26.000]  but he created the money masters some years ago.
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:34.000]  And I have the honour of being in a segment that comes along with this newest film.
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:39.000]  He was talking a lot about, like very many other people that have come to Iceland
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  or gotten in touch with me about alternative monetary systems.
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000]  And I think that is very, very important.
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:53.000]  The next step that we do is to find ways to have a completely different monetary system
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  than we live with today.
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:39:01.000]  I find the fractional reserve banking system basically to be criminal.
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  The way the entire financial world is run is criminal.
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:15.000]  But we have to find solutions that are more in tune with reality.
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:20.000]  So we don't have these endless bubbles blowing over our worlds
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:23.000]  and sucking out the last riches that we have.
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  And to brazenly boil that down, yes, I know about the money masters director.
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:31.000]  We actually carry that three hour film at infowars.com
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:34.000]  that was put out over a decade ago as the preeminent work
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:39.000]  exposing the fractional reserve banking system that is mathematically designed
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:42.000]  to create more debt than you can physically pay back.
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:47.000]  And within a generation, the bankers get incredible power while the bubbles expanding.
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:50.000]  And then when it implodes, they fully enslave you.
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:54.000]  That's what's happened to Africa, Latin America and poor areas of Asia.
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:59.000]  It's on record that the IMF and World Bank have done this and now they're doing it to Greece.
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000]  What is it like for you to see Greece?
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000]  Iceland says no.
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:06.000]  It turns out the banks admit Iceland didn't really owe all this money.
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  Most of the debt was their debt.
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:09.000]  They were making you pay it.
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:13.000]  And that 600 plus islands, their roads, their infrastructure
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:18.000]  is being individually sold back to the banking and brokerage firm owners
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:24.000]  who are buying the islands from the Greek government with money they stole from the Greek people.
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:30.000]  It is really incredible and I really feel for the Greek people.
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:35.000]  And I've been collaborating a little bit with some people in Greece
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:42.000]  and managed to get together. There's an international organization called ATAC,
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:48.000]  ATTAC.org that has been fighting the IMF
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.000]  and introducing such systems as the token tax and so forth.
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:56.000]  But we have not been saved in Iceland
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:02.000]  because what the government did is that they put in the newest contract with the IMF
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  having our third review.
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:11.000]  They put in that we would actually pay back
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:17.000]  and that we would compensate reasonable taxes,
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:20.000]  which is totally against what the nation voted for.
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:23.000]  Okay, so see, I've missed this.
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:26.000]  Last time I checked, you've been in a year-long fight.
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:31.000]  You had said, no, we're not going to pay these tens of millions of dollars that we don't owe
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000]  to banks that sold derivatives.
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:36.000]  We're not going to have public groups pay private debt.
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:40.000]  And so the parliament passed that and you're now saying the bureaucracy
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:44.000]  is circumventing the will of the people and the government.
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:49.000]  Well, the government, no, no, the government actually said
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:54.000]  who are the Atlantic Finance Minister and the head of the Central Bank
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:42:00.000]  signed the latest sort of site or the latest contract with the IMF.
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:07.000]  What the nation did actually vetoed what the parliament had passed
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  as the new contract about ICA last, when was it, in January or March?
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  It's been so eventful this year.
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:21.000]  Anyway, so we are by far not saved.
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:27.000]  And I am sending out, as today, I am sending out right here and right now
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:30.000]  as to help us get out of the IMF program.
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:33.000]  We do need the plan B and we do need all that has possible help we can.
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  And I really think that nations that have been struggling under the IMF program
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  need to work together and to just inform each other what do we have to make sure
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:47.000]  that we have to look out for.
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:54.000]  For example, just recently a month ago, one of our energy companies has been taken over
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:58.000]  or bought by a foreign investor and that is always the first step in the IMF program.
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:05.000]  We will lose all our assets or all our natural resources to foreign investors,
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:06.000]  not the corporations.
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:09.000]  It's like what happened in Bolivia.
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:14.000]  In fact, they'll privatize water and even the rainwater, you have to pay for that.
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:20.000]  So we are by far not saved yet, so we need all the help we can.
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:26.000]  But you did win that major victory in saying no up front, but of course they never back off.
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:29.000]  They just keep pushing and pushing and pushing.
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  Going back to WikiLeaks here briefly, this is such a huge story.
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:40.000]  Is there anything else you can tell us or just in one statement without me interrupting,
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:46.000]  break down your part in that saga so we can understand how you guys release things
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:54.000]  or how you're involved with WikiLeaks, how the famous Baghdad Massacre footage from 2007
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:58.000]  got released a few months ago showing them shooting the van full of kids,
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:01.000]  killing the Reuters reporter and then laughing about it.
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:04.000]  And we'll play some of that video in the background while you're speaking.
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:07.000]  Can you talk about your involvement in that video?
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:12.000]  Well, I started to work with a couple of people from WikiLeaks.
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:18.000]  Julian Assange and Daniel Smith in relation to, you know, ASTAN to help me
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:24.000]  and other organizations here in Iceland to, because they have such incredible insight
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:30.000]  into where laws are weak and where laws are strong when it comes to information
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:35.000]  and protection of sources and whistleblowers and so forth.
[02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:43.000]  So I started to work with them and we had probably around 10 people from different parts of the world
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:48.000]  working with us, people experts and so forth when it comes to legislation and this report.
[02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:57.000]  So during that period, it was quite intense work period, March, April, or March,
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:06.000]  I saw the Iraqi video and I decided to help with that in any way I could during my Easter holiday from the parliament
[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:15.000]  because, you know, I am one of these people that helped organize protests against this war before it became a reality
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:21.000]  and knowing how war is, you know, there's always war crimes
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:25.000]  and these things that happen that nobody will ever get to know.
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:30.000]  So when I saw this video, it was just a confirmation on what I had heard but not seen
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:38.000]  and it was such an incredibly shocking scene to see, in particular after you knew who they were blasting down
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:47.000]  and just this general ambience in the video, the complete disrespect for the people that have just killed or about to kill.
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:50.000]  Yeah, even if you're going to kill somebody, you should be reverent about it.
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:56.000]  This childlike, I mean, I saw videos of the G20 protesters singing O Canada, O Canada,
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:01.000]  and police beating men, women and children and I saw the comments going, yeah, beat them hippies.
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:06.000]  I mean, again, they're fighting against the corrupt banks that are robbing us,
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:09.000]  but even if they are hippies, what's wrong with that?
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000]  Why would you support an injustice?
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:16.000]  Why do people feel like they're winners when they kill some kids or beat some women?
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000]  I mean, this is sick.
[02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000]  It is very sick.
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:27.000]  And I think one of the beautiful elements of this entire story with the Iraqi video
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:33.000]  is that we did send journalists, an investigative journalist, one of our best here in Iceland,
[02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:40.000]  to talk about the fact, Jack, to check if he could find witnesses and the children and so forth.
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:46.000]  And he indeed did find the children who had been very seriously wounded.
[02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:54.000]  And Ethan, I forgot his last name, one of the soldiers that actually discovered the children
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:47:00.000]  and was running with them to the hospital.
[02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:04.000]  That's right, the ground forces show up and save the children who are bleeding to death.
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:05.000]  Wow, yes.
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:11.000]  And then they tell the helicopters you shot kids and the helicopter guys start basically laughing about it
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:16.000]  and showing the difference. They're up, dehumanize themselves, dehumanizing those they're killing,
[02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:23.000]  but the actual ground trips, they're actually there seeing the carnage and they haven't lost their humanity.
[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:28.000]  But this, in particular, this soldier who was carrying the children,
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:35.000]  he has done some incredibly great acts and he's with another soldier reason and apology to the families
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:42.000]  that, for example, to the children and the mother who lost their husband, she lost her husband and they lost their father.
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:49.000]  And I think one of the reasons the children were saved was the father's body after it had been killed shielded them.
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:57.000]  So in a sense, and it was so important also for the families of the Reuters staff to finally hear the truth
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:02.000]  and find it so important that we remember that this is just one video,
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:05.000]  how many more incidents are there like this?
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:11.000]  This is not just one, three incidents. There is another segment in this video of what's the road cut
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  where you can see them blasting up a house or a big department building
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  and there is this guy just walking along the pavement and they have him, they see him and they still fire at the house
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:29.000]  and they have no respect for life. And there were so many families in that house
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:36.000]  and there was, there actually, the reporter from Item Managed to track down one of the people that lived there
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:39.000]  and he lost his wife and his daughter.
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:43.000]  That's important to humanize these people because when the Army is used against us,
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:49.000]  here in the United States, we want to be seen as human and they are training the military to take on the American people.
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:56.000]  In fact, here's an article today, Check Military to Help National Guard Establish Chemical Warfare Unit in Texas.
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:00.000]  And I've been to these drills, these foreign troops are actually training to take on the American people.
[02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:04.000]  They'll have a decontamination drill in front of the media for outward consumption,
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:07.000]  but the real drills are to take on the American people.
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:15.000]  And we're going to premiere next week the video from Chicago of foreign troops training to take on the American people.
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:18.000]  So it's Iraqis today, it's us tomorrow.
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:28.000]  But you said something interesting, Brigitte Jones-Dottier, member of the Icelandic Parliament and who helped leak some of the WikiLeaks information videos.
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:39.000]  You were saying that the Army Specialist Bradley Manning, you were implying that he really didn't, isn't the one that gave this information to WikiLeaks.
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:40.000]  I mean, you're saying that...
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:51.000]  I'm just saying that, you know, I personally don't have any proof for that. So I don't want to assume that it is indeed him or somebody else.
[02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:59.000]  But I mean, let's say it is him. I mean, Daniel Ellsberg didn't get in trouble or they tried to for releasing stuff that showed the government was lying
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:02.000]  and knew that the Vietnam War was lost, it was a moneymaker.
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:10.000]  I mean, if the people that released the photos of Abu Ghraib torture, they didn't go to prison, the people that did the torture did.
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  This is, many human rights experts have pointed out, Obama seems to be expanding persecution of whistleblowers that have always been protected.
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:25.000]  Well, I think, you know, if this is Bradley Manning or at least the Iraqi video, I think he's a hero.
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:35.000]  He's just beheld like a hero. And I think it is very disturbing to find out what is actually occurring under Obama,
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:46.000]  because I think a lot of people are hoping that he would be entirely different than he has been showing his very different person before the election.
[02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:58.000]  And I think that you guys have been extremely on alert and on guard and to give him proper pressure, so that he doesn't...
[02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:24.000]  Bradley, just stay there, final segment with you.
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:34.000]  Thank you so much for watching this video.

[02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:02.000]  The Problem
[02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000]  How do I cook food without power?
[02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:07.000]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:10.000]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000]  How can I make safe drinking water?

[02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:21.000]  Well, an award-winning documentary filmmaker is going to have a new film about the murder of Pat Tillman.
[02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:27.000]  He was going to air in theaters around the country, and then on television, probably HBO.
[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:31.000]  McChrystal, by the way, was the guy who engaged in that cover-up of the murder of Pat Tillman.
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:35.000]  He was going to whistle blow about opium production and the war being a fraud.
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:39.000]  And they weren't going to let their biggest poster boy do that, so they killed him better than a hammer.
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:45.000]  He was shot at a distance, and they came up on him and shot him at near-point length range three times in the head.
[02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:49.000]  And Army Coroner came out and said he was murdered. All the evidence showed murder.
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:55.000]  They're not going to cover this up, and that's at GCNLive.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:55:01.000]  The letters G-C-N-Live, that's the network website. It's a prisonplanet.com article,
[02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:04.000]  but the best place to find it's at GCNLive.com.
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:09.000]  New big-screen documentary exposes Pat Tillman. Cover-up, very, very important.
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:13.000]  And Brigitte Jones' daughter here is whether she's a champion of liberty, really is.
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:17.000]  And, you know, she's saying, oh, I'm not in danger. Oh, you know, the head of WikiLeaks, he's not in danger.
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:24.000]  Well, Ellsberg says he is in danger. You know, he's saying that Julian Assange is in danger,
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:28.000]  and I tend to agree. And so, please, I know you want to get it out perfect
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:32.000]  and have journalists all over vet the videos and documents you have first.
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:36.000]  But if it came from the Pentagon, I would just put it all out there and say,
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:41.000]  folks, you decide what you think of this. This is too dangerous. We're handing the ball off.
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:47.000]  But that's my advice, and I'm not trying to scare you. You're a member of parliament.
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:52.000]  But, you know, I told the D.C. madam, I said, you need to release everything you know about those clients,
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:55.000]  and she didn't do it, and they murdered her. And I talked to her apartment manager.
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:59.000]  She said, yeah, men were following her. She was going to see her mom.
[02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:02.000]  She thought they were trying to kill her. And then they did a fake note.
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:07.000]  I even compared the note. I even got the suicide note, compared it to her lease agreement.
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  That was sent to me by the manager of the condos. He was friends with her.
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:15.000]  She lived there for a decade, and they killed her. And I'm not trying to scare you.
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:20.000]  I'm just telling you, these people don't play games. And I know you know that,
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:25.000]  but just you're not bulletproof. We love you. And, you know, ideas are bulletproof,
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:30.000]  but you're not bulletproof. And I just, and he's not bulletproof, either don't release it
[02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:33.000]  and say, okay, I'm not going to release it or get that info out now,
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:38.000]  because they are hunting Julian Assange. Go ahead.
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:46.000]  Well, I just want to stress that this information will be out as soon as possible.
[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:49.000]  And you're never going to commit suicide?
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:50.000]  Never.
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:53.000]  And Julian would never commit suicide?
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000]  No.
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:57:03.000]  So, but I think, you know, we're being cautious, I mean, in particular him and other Wikileaks volunteers.
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:12.000]  But I also, I find that, you know, it should be very important that people go to the Wikileaks.org website
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:15.000]  and read all the other material that is already available there.
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:21.000]  There's an incredible gold mine of information that, you know, has been coming through the site
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:27.000]  for more than two years, more than three years. So, go and advocate yourself.
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:34.000]  I think that's very important. And there's also a lot of, if people want to familiarize themselves
[02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:39.000]  with the initial proposal, there's a very comprehensive website with information
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:44.000]  about what this will actually do after IMMI.is.
[02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:48.000]  Well, Birgitta, we salute you and thank you for coming on and being interrogated.
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:53.000]  We look forward to speaking to you as soon as this video or this text gets released.
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:57.000]  Will you promise to come on for at least 10, 15 minutes when the new video comes out
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:00.000]  or new Wikileaks information?
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:01.000]  I will do so.
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:05.000]  Well, you're awesome. Any other websites you'd like to give out for people?
[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:12.000]  Well, I just want to stress and please ask people if they have horror stories from the IMF, please share it with me.
[02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:18.000]  I'm hoping that we can put together a documentary about how the IMF really works.
[02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:21.000]  So, please share this information if you have it.
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:24.000]  Well, you're awesome. You're getting laws passed. You're getting documents out.
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:28.000]  You're making films. You are doing everything you can for human liberty.
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:32.000]  And because of your spirit and people like you, Birgitta Jones.org,
[02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:36.000]  Humanity and my children have a shot at a good future.
[02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:40.000]  We salute you. God bless you.
[02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:43.000]  We'll be back.
[02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.000 --> 02:59:11.000]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:15.000]  Number 3. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:19.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:22.000]  Number 4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:26.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:31.000]  Number 5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:36.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:42.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:42.000 --> 03:00:11.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:25.000]  Okay, we got Larry B. Kraft in the balance of the hour coming up after the eight after.
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:29.000]  I know we got loaded phones and I've done a pretty good job lately getting to some of your phone calls.
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:35.000]  But right now, let's jam in as many calls as we can.
[03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:40.000]  I'm trying to pull up my call list right now.
[03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:43.000]  I'm going to try to get in as many as I can.
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:52.000]  Just a minute or two from each person before we get our guests on about Elena Kagan and the ongoing nightmare Supreme Court nomination that's going on right now.
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:56.000]  So we'll break down who this woman really is and what she really stands for.
[03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:59.000]  We've got her college thesis here about socialism.
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:05.000]  If you want to be Hillary Clinton or you want to be a Supreme Court justice, you've got to be a commie because that's all Goldman Sachs bankrolls.
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:08.000]  She's also a Goldman Sachs partner.
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000]  Of course, the banks want you to be a communist.
[03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:11.000]  You give them all your money.
[03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000]  They give you a machine gun in the face.
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000]  Hi, I'm Elena Kagan.
[03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000]  You know, Mrs. Penguin.
[03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:20.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Hawaii.
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:22.000]  You're on the year, Joe.
[03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:25.000]  Hey, Alex Jones, you've been doing a great job.
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:26.000]  I commend you for that.
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:29.000]  Well, I try my best.
[03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:39.000]  I just wanted to mention to you, you talked about how people that were born in the 70s were on a database.
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:49.000]  And I wanted to comment on that, that they like to use two decades, I guess, you know, because they kind of like it.
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:54.000]  There's a lot of bias and, you know, and...
[03:01:54.000 --> 03:02:04.000]  Well, all I know is the facts in a worldwide program in almost every industrialized country, starting in 1972, 73, all blood was taken from babies at birth.
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000]  And they told them, oh, it's a blood test, honey.
[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:10.000]  And it was sent to the Pentagon for bio weapons research, mainly.
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.000]  And now that's all declassified.
[03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.000]  I got the secret documents 15 years ago.
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.000]  People wouldn't believe it.
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:17.000]  Go ahead.
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:23.000]  Well, anyways, so I think that that, you know, they, I've been fighting this for quite some time.
[03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:29.000]  I wrote a letter to Dan Rather back in 89 and he didn't reply back to me.
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:33.000]  Well, I would imagine he got, you know, gets a lot of mail, but...
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:34.000]  Okay.
[03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:46.000]  But anyways, I was, the reason that, you know, I've noticed like on TV and so forth, there's a lot of biasness on certain ages that they, you know, prefer.
[03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:52.000]  Well, they're always playing class off, race off, what, you know, timeframe you came from.
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:56.000]  It's all about categorizing things so they can divide and conquer us.
[03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:58.000]  Instead of, I'm into liberty.
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:02:59.000]  I'm into freedom.
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:02.000]  I'm against tyranny because almost everyone is for liberty.
[03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:06.000]  So they try to confuse us and have us go off of, I've got a Mohawk.
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000]  Well, I wear a cowboy hat.
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:12.000]  All these little niches and little fake terms we attach to ourselves.
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:15.000]  I'm not saying it's bad if you wear a cowboy hat or have a Mohawk.
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:16.000]  I don't care.
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:23.000]  People see some of my crew and some are conservative looking, some are preppy looking, some look like hippies, some look like punk rockers.
[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000]  You know, I don't care what you look like.
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:28.000]  It's the content of your actions that I care about.
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:36.000]  I have found though, statistically, sometimes people into certain types of genres and things are into self-destructive things and I stay away from them.
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.000]  But I appreciate your call, Joe.
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:39.000]  I appreciate that.
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:42.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Josh in California.
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000]  You're on the air.
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:45.000]  Hi, Alex.
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:58.000]  Hey, you know, I was wondering, I've noticed recently, every time I've seen an oil spill on television anywhere, like the Exxon Valdez, a number of them, they've always been packed.
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:05.000]  And I've noticed that there's a lot of red in all of this and they haven't really explained that.
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:08.000]  But I was curious if you had heard anything about...
[03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000]  Yeah, I can explain it.
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:15.000]  Most of what you're seeing, in fact, I saw this on CBS.
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:16.000]  I saw it on ABC.
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:19.000]  I meant to do a YouTube about it a month ago.
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:22.000]  They would show crews picking up oil and it wasn't oil.
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.000]  It was seaweed.
[03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  A couple of months ago, it started coming in.
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:34.000]  It comes in in the spring and it's there all summer on the south coast, on the coast of the Gulf.
[03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:41.000]  They're seaweed and it's green in the water and it's red a day out of the water and then it shrivels up and turns black.
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:47.000]  And most of what they cleaned up was seaweed and so it's the media panicking and showing seaweed.
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:51.000]  Sometimes seaweed mixed with oil because the oil hasn't come in yet.
[03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:55.000]  The real fun starts once it comes into shore and so they're fear mongering.
[03:04:55.000 --> 03:05:01.000]  But also I've seen some of it coming out of the wellhead that's red, so there's different types of crude oil.
[03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:04.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:09.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:14.000]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:16.000]  Food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:17.000]  How much do you want?
[03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:18.000]  When do you want it?
[03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:20.000]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:21.000]  When will you need it?
[03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:23.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:26.000]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:30.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center?
[03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:31.000]  And be immunized?
[03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:35.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:39.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:40.000]  How much will you need?
[03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:41.000]  We don't know.
[03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:42.000]  How much do you want?
[03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:43.000]  All you can get.
[03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:44.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:47.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:07:53.000 --> 03:08:21.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:28.000]  Well, joining us for the next 52 minutes is Larry B. Kraft, constitutional attorney based in Huntsville, Alabama,
[03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:33.000]  who specializes in criminal defense cases, primarily involving the federal income tax.
[03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:36.000]  And he's won a lot of cases in the highest courts of the land.
[03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:39.000]  He's a real patriot constitutional lawyer.
[03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:40.000]  That's why we like to have him on.
[03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:43.000]  In fact, we should have him on a lot more than we've had him on.
[03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:46.000]  Just time flies when you're fighting, tearing and having fun.
[03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:56.000]  And we'll give you his website on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers as well and have him verbally give it out to radio listeners coming up.
[03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:59.000]  Now, he sent us something I hadn't seen.
[03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:00.000]  I'd seen some of her law papers.
[03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:05.000]  I'd seen decisions and positions she put out as Solicitor General.
[03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:11.000]  I had seen how she lobbied in White House minutes for radical political agenda.
[03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:12.000]  She's anti-second amendment.
[03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:18.000]  She's made statements like if the government doesn't like speech, we can disappear it.
[03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:24.000]  We've got the diversity czar in the White House saying we need to have censorship like Hugo Chavez of Venezuela.
[03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:33.000]  I've seen Cass Sunstein, of course, say put a tax on at first the Internet and alternative news, then start arresting people.
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:39.000]  That's now been proposed by the FCC and made national news, even the Associated Press.
[03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:47.000]  I mean, this is really happening to start the taxing, to start the black boxes that decide what you can get the prior restraint of information.
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000]  So it's all going on.
[03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:59.000]  But I wanted to get him on last week about Kagan coming out, but he separately this morning sent us her thesis, the conclusions lengthy.
[03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:04.000]  And I've only read part of it, but he's read the whole hundred page document.
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:10.000]  The final conflict, the globalist always call it the final revolution, the final conflict.
[03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:14.000]  Socialism in New York City, 1900 to 1933, and just scanning over it.
[03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:20.000]  I said to Becraft, is this how the socialist wonderful dream failed when the progressives tried to take over?
[03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:21.000]  And he said, yes.
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:25.000]  So we're going to get him to go over the lowlights of this.
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:28.000]  And of course, last year we got Hillary's thesis that had been sealed.
[03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:30.000]  How great Lenin was.
[03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:33.000]  How great, I mean, these people are monsters.
[03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:37.000]  They are revolutionaries overthrowing our republic.
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.000]  They want to silence you.
[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:42.000]  They want to make you a war to the state.
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:46.000]  But I wanted to first with Larry Becraft get his take.
[03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:47.000]  And he has heard it.
[03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:50.000]  I asked him of Kagan's own words.
[03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:56.000]  It's fine if the law bans books because government won't really enforce it.
[03:10:56.000 --> 03:11:07.000]  This is her before the Supreme Court as the solicitor general and the Supreme Court saying, well, this statute that's being challenged in a court case, we're saying it should be changed.
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:08.000]  Not even a statute.
[03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:14.000]  It's a regulation because it doesn't matter if it hasn't been used.
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:17.000]  This says the government can ban books preemptively.
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:19.000]  And so we want it thrown out.
[03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:29.000]  And she says, no, if it hasn't been used, we're not going to voluntarily change it in the federal agencies because it doesn't matter because she wants to keep that power there.
[03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:37.000]  And I don't know what you legally call this, but the justices got angry whether and did reverse her.
[03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:43.000]  But here's an article, Nat Hintaw, Philadelphia man indicted for using right to free speech.
[03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:46.000]  And I read this earlier in the show, but I want to reread it because it's so important.
[03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:50.000]  This has been all over the news, but the news is reporting it as if it's a good thing.
[03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:54.000]  Bruce Shore had lost his job.
[03:11:54.000 --> 03:12:04.000]  He saw Senator Jim Bunning on C-span on Washington Journal talking about how he didn't want to have to go debate unemployment benefits because he wanted to go to a baseball game.
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:08.000]  And that made the man livid because he was on unemployment.
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  So he sent an email saying, are you all insane?
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:16.000]  That's quote, no checks equal no food for me.
[03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:17.000]  Do you get it?
[03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:24.000]  And then it goes on how the grand jury indicted him, the FBI arrested him and US Marshals came and got him.
[03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:37.000]  And they quoted in the indictment by the grand jury the language in the Communications Act of 1934 as amended and updated and including electronic messages of the Telecommunications Act of 96.
[03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:46.000]  And it said he did utilize the device to abuse, threaten or harass any person who received the communication.
[03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:59.000]  And so they're now saying, well, calling them crazy or asking if you're insane is now an act of, again, what's the key term they use here, of trying to find an annoyance.
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:01.000]  An annoyance will put you in prison.
[03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:13.000]  Now, if that isn't the essence of tyranny, I don't know what is. So I wanted to dovetail that with Kagan's asinine statement of, well, just because it's on the books and we haven't used it, let's leave it there.
[03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:17.000]  Let's get Larry B. Kraft's take on that. Larry, thank you for joining us.
[03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:19.000]  Best pleasure, Alex. How you doing?
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:23.000]  Good. Break down what you think of this before I play the short clip.
[03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:24.000]  You mean Kagan?
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:31.000]  Yes, Kagan's arguing that we can have a law on the books to ban books.
[03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:40.000]  This goes back around to, if you remember when Sotomayor was going through her confirmation hearings, you know, she was asked questions about the Second Amendment.
[03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:49.000]  And, you know, she seemed to acknowledge, you know, what she, you know, it means what it says, you know, I'm not going to be an advocate on the court that's going to do something different.
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:57.000]  And yet, yesterday when that decision came out, I guess, where Sotomayor is, she's in the minority, she's against it.
[03:13:57.000 --> 03:14:05.000]  Yes, she said, I support the Chicago Total Gun Band, just like the Attorney General, just like Obama as a senator. I mean, they're a pack of liars.
[03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:18.000]  Kagan has an agenda, and her agenda is revealed. One of the two things that I haven't had access to are some University of Chicago law review articles that she wrote.
[03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:25.000]  She wrote one in 1993, and she wrote one in 1996. The first one is entitled Regulation to Hate Speech and Photography.
[03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:32.000]  And the second one in 1996, Private Speech, Public Purpose, the Role of Governmental Motive in the First Amendment Doctrine.
[03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:39.000]  Now, if you take a look at, you know, all the cases dealing with the First Amendment, taking into consideration what the First Amendment says, Congress will make no law.
[03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:49.000]  And then take a look at the decisions, and, you know, the court's pretty strong in upholding First Amendment rights as they go.
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:50.000]  Her opinion in these law reviews is ass-backwards.
[03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:58.000]  Absolutely. But what she has an agenda, and the agenda is to move away and bring in a new criteria for judging the rights under the First Amendment.
[03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:06.000]  You know, right now, the way the Supreme Court will look at it is, here's speech, somebody said it, and his government is bridging it, stopping the speech.
[03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:16.000]  He wants to come along, and if you read these two law review articles that she's written, her objective is to, well, let's bring in a new format here for analysis of it.
[03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:20.000]  And government can regulate speech if government has a good motive.
[03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:27.000]  And the quote is, if we're stopping discrimination, prior constraint is okay, we can disappear of the speech.
[03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:28.000]  Correct.
[03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:32.000]  I think that's one of the reasons why she's being promoted to the court.
[03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:37.000]  Yeah, they said, my God, this woman ought to be in running Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia.
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:42.000]  In fact, you say you have those papers, I've read them before on air, but do you have those actual quotes in front of you?
[03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:47.000]  Well, I don't have those quotes. I've got some quotes that I pulled up for the purposes of the show.
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:16:01.000]  Like in the 1993 law review article, you know, she stated, the question I pose is whether there are any ways to achieve at least some of the goals of, you know, anti-portography and anti-H in spite of the First Amendment.
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:10.000]  And then she goes on to say, well, you know, we could come up with some legislation that might be able to surmount the First Amendment hurdles.
[03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:13.000]  That's her major point that she makes in her 93.
[03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:17.000]  I've seen that quote, like the First Amendment's a hurdle you got to get over.
[03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:26.000]  And boy, isn't she a genius because she's going to figure out, I mean, Thomas Jefferson had these quotes about, you know, let's not have people in there in the future that twist the meaning of things.
[03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:29.000]  Let's be very clear. And it is very clear.
[03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:36.000]  Well, that's exactly what her purpose is, is to change the meaning, make it more confusing, to totally stand it on its head.
[03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:53.000]  Now, the 96 law review article she wrote, you know, she's bringing in a new concept and you'll find that, you know, law review articles written by, you know, the pointy-headed people like Elena Kagan, you know, the whole purpose is to begin to change the philosophy of things.
[03:16:53.000 --> 03:17:03.000]  And, you know, in this particular article, she's bringing in the idea that, well, you know, we ought to look at the First Amendment from the perspective of, you know, does the government have a good motive?
[03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:13.000]  And, you know, if the government has a motive in suppressing a certain speech and it's, you know, it's beneficial and it's a good motive, that plays a role in whether or not we can squelch speech.
[03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:24.000]  And so you can see, if she gets on the court, first of all, you know, she's going to begin the corrosion of what we have to understand today in the way of our First Amendment rights.
[03:17:24.000 --> 03:17:28.000]  That's her whole purpose for getting on the court.
[03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:30.000]  Would you agree or not?
[03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:32.000]  Oh, listen, I read these...
[03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:36.000]  She's a big friend of Cass Sunstein. She mentions him in this 1996 article.
[03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:43.000]  She's the one that brought her into Harvard, and of course, she's a former Goldman Sachs member, and he mentions no words.
[03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:45.000]  He says, I want to arrest people, and we've read his quotes.
[03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:49.000]  No, I mean, I agree with you totally. I've read the same law papers that you've read.
[03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:56.000]  I just want to get your view on it, and it's just that it gets more and more incredible how brazen they are.
[03:17:56.000 --> 03:18:02.000]  I mean, this woman is not suited. She's never tried a case. She's never been a judge.
[03:18:02.000 --> 03:18:06.000]  She's really there.
[03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:07.000]  So, I guess the fact...
[03:18:07.000 --> 03:18:09.000]  She's really there, Alex. Don't forget that.
[03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:11.000]  Yeah, so she's rich, so it's okay.
[03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:15.000]  Right. Hey, Alex, you know, let's get back to the... Of course, she wrote in 1981.
[03:18:15.000 --> 03:18:19.000]  You know, she was a student at Princeton, and she had to write a thesis.
[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:22.000]  So, she sent out a... And you know that somebody...
[03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:27.000]  But listen, let's go back to the days when you and I were that age, you know, early 20s.
[03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:31.000]  Has your mindset really changed since you were 20, 21?
[03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:33.000]  No. No, I've only...
[03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:37.000]  You've learned more facts, and you've been toured in your same beliefs.
[03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:46.000]  Yes, I was pro-Second Amendment, pro-property rights, patriotic American, and my parents passed on what I can now look back in hindsight,
[03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:51.000]  the proper view, the only view, pro-liberty, true freedom, true individualism,
[03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:55.000]  and it's only become more seasoned and more intense.
[03:18:55.000 --> 03:19:01.000]  Well, she's from the same mold. She has gone down through the same process.
[03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:07.000]  She was socialistic. She wouldn't sit down and write 130 pages about the history of socialism
[03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:13.000]  in a 20-year period at the first part of the 20th century, 1901 through about 1919, 1920.
[03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:19.000]  She writes a history of, you know, why the socialistic movement in New York, you know, got rolling,
[03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:25.000]  and, you know, had to go through a bunch of battles and, you know, how it waned and, you know, didn't have any influence.
[03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:34.000]  Now, that is so... When you sit down and read what she wrote in her thesis, you can tell she's not someone that is against communism.
[03:19:34.000 --> 03:19:40.000]  She is somebody that throws in all the little places, you know, the glories of socialism. She loves it.
[03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:44.000]  Well, stay there, stay there. You've got the thesis, and I haven't seen anybody cover this one.
[03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:50.000]  I'm glad you fair to this out. Larry Beacraft, constitutional lawyer and scholar, is our guest.
[03:19:50.000 --> 03:19:54.000]  We're going to come back and go through her writings, go through what this thesis says,
[03:19:54.000 --> 03:20:18.000]  and then I'm going to ask him about this new Second Amendment ruling. We'll be right back.
[03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:30.000]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:36.000]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:20:36.000 --> 03:20:42.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:48.000]  How much do you want all you can get? I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:20:56.000 --> 03:21:19.000]  Hello, Ted Anderson. Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:28.000]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[03:21:28.000 --> 03:21:33.000]  A current effort is underway by the Fed, along with other central banks, to increase liquidity for depositors.
[03:21:33.000 --> 03:21:38.000]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:46.000]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[03:21:46.000 --> 03:21:53.000]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.

[03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:25.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:31.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:22:31.000 --> 03:22:49.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.

[03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:19.000]  The B-Craft constitutional lawyer is our guest. We're looking at the confirmation of Elena Kagan. Will she be confirmed? Republicans are leaning towards, at least the leadership's saying they're going to confirm her.
[03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:27.000]  You had four of the nine. That's a good point Larry made out of the gates, who said, we believe in total gun bans in America. It's not an individual right yesterday.
[03:24:27.000 --> 03:24:36.000]  And the way I read that decision is, but we'll talk about this in the next segment, is that, oh, you got a right, but we can regulate it down to nothing.
[03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:48.000]  And so this is the first time the Supreme Court, for my knowledge, has ruled that they have a right to start restricting. So I see it as a big defeat overall, kind of like the last ruling.
[03:24:48.000 --> 03:25:00.000]  Well, we can regulate and restrict them. You just can't be a total restriction. But we'll get Larry B-Craft's take on that coming up later. Larry, getting back into her thesis, here it is, conclusion to the thesis.
[03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:09.000]  As she's basically just talking about why the poor socialist didn't completely take America down and like they were able to in the Soviet Russia. Please continue.
[03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:21.000]  Well, Alex, I think of conclusion, you know, this is a lady that wrote about for 130 plus pages in her thesis, the glories of socialism she examined the 20 year period.
[03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:36.000]  It shows to me she's studying exactly what she likes. Now the conclusion is a very good demonstration of how she feels. Could I read the very last paragraph of the conclusion of her thesis?
[03:25:36.000 --> 03:25:39.000]  Oh, no, read all the quotes she won directly from her.
[03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:54.000]  Through its own interfeuding there, the Socialist Party exhausted itself forever and further reduced labor radicalism in New York to the position of marginality and insignificance from which it has never recovered.
[03:25:54.000 --> 03:26:07.000]  The story is a sad but also chastening one for those who, more than a half a century after socialism's decline, still wish to change America.
[03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:18.000]  Radicals have often succumbed to the devastating bane of sectarianism. It is easier, after all, to fight one's fellows than it is to battle in interest in powerful foe.
[03:26:18.000 --> 03:26:32.000]  Yet if the history of local New York shows anything, it is that American radicals cannot afford to become their own worst enemies. In unity lies their only hope.
[03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:42.000]  She penned these words. She wants the forces of socialism that were battling each other back in the early part of the 20th century.
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:48.000]  Well, they're a pack of parasites that can never be united and become America's radicals.
[03:26:48.000 --> 03:26:54.000]  And of course they can't ever work together. There are a bunch of parasites, a bunch of vampires, and vampires can't feed on vampires.
[03:26:54.000 --> 03:27:01.000]  But the big banks literally finance these monsters because they socialize working people's wealth and then give it to themselves.
[03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:06.000]  And the poor working people that got conned into socialism, they end up in a work camp.
[03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:16.000]  Did you see her yesterday and today the way I've never seen somebody in a confirmation hearing for the cabinet, for the military scowl and act crazed?
[03:27:16.000 --> 03:27:19.000]  She is so arrogant. I mean, did you see that?
[03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:27.000]  Well, I heard your comments yesterday. You know, only because of what you said yesterday, last night I watched on the boob tube, some coverage of it.
[03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:38.000]  And I agree 100% with what you had to say. She was scowling. Hey, she's scary to look at. What more do you need to say, Alex?
[03:27:38.000 --> 03:27:46.000]  Well, I mean, yeah, I see people that aren't the classic attractive all the time, but if they have a jovial, nice attitude, I find them attractive.
[03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:52.000]  I mean, it's almost like a light bulb in somebody. If it's a nice light, they look nice. It could be an old fat man, doesn't matter.
[03:27:52.000 --> 03:27:58.000]  But if somebody's evil, I mean, when I look at her, I was getting upset yesterday. They had her on the TV set. There's a TV set.
[03:27:58.000 --> 03:28:04.000]  In fact, guys, show them in the document cam. There's a television set in here in the control room and the broadcast studio.
[03:28:04.000 --> 03:28:14.000]  And I was looking at her and it was just flipping me out that this maggot, this anti-second amendment, anti-free speech monster, that my children will live under this witch.
[03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:20.000]  And just the power-tripping arrogant scowl, it was driving me into a rage, Larry.
[03:28:20.000 --> 03:28:30.000]  People, you know, with that type of internal makeup, that internal makeup shows through and not only their personality, but their physical features.
[03:28:30.000 --> 03:28:40.000]  So, you know, you weren't looking at somebody that was concealed. You got to see actually who she was, and that's scary.
[03:28:40.000 --> 03:28:46.000]  Well, that's another great point, Larry. I'll continue. We're going to break her in a moment, but continue with any other quotes out of the thesis.
[03:28:46.000 --> 03:28:50.000]  I mean, that was, in fact, reread that. That was so telling.
[03:28:50.000 --> 03:28:58.000]  Well, let me read the beginning of it. In our own times, the coherent socialist movement is nowhere to be found in the United States.
[03:28:58.000 --> 03:29:08.000]  Americans are more likely to speak of a golden past than of a golden future, of capitalism's glories than of socialism's greatness.
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:18.000]  Conformity overrides dissent. The desire to conserve has overwhelmed the urge to alter. Such a state affairs cries out for an explanation.
[03:29:18.000 --> 03:29:28.000]  Here's the explanation why in a society by no means perfect has a radical party never attained the status of a major political force.
[03:29:28.000 --> 03:29:36.000]  But now they have with Obama, and you've got, in his book he wrote, and on TV, he says he loves Saul Alinsky. That's Chris Matthews.
[03:29:36.000 --> 03:29:42.000]  He loves communism. But then if you even call government health care socialism, Chris Matthews calls you a racist.
[03:29:42.000 --> 03:29:48.000]  He knows what he's doing. He's using race card to bully you and is submitting to his murderous takeover.
[03:29:48.000 --> 03:29:51.000]  These people are parasite criminals who want your guns.
[03:29:51.000 --> 03:30:00.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:31:18.000 --> 03:31:29.000]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:31:29.000 --> 03:31:36.000]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[03:31:36.000 --> 03:31:41.000]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:31:41.000 --> 03:31:50.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[03:32:00.000 --> 03:32:04.000]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[03:32:04.000 --> 03:32:11.000]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[03:32:11.000 --> 03:32:18.000]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[03:32:18.000 --> 03:32:23.000]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big-money-saving triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[03:32:23.000 --> 03:32:32.000]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at www.5starsoap.com or www.info-wars.com.
[03:32:32.000 --> 03:32:36.000]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[03:32:36.000 --> 03:32:43.000]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[03:32:43.000 --> 03:32:47.000]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[03:32:47.000 --> 03:33:02.000]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website www.5starsoap.com for buying a one-to-two-month soap sampler. Thank you.
[03:33:02.000 --> 03:33:19.000]  Alright, I've been interrupting B-Craft, as I always do, into my banter. I want him to go back through her treatise, through her thesis, through some of her other quotes here in a moment,
[03:33:19.000 --> 03:33:28.000]  and then want to play the audio of her before the Supreme Court as the Solicitor General, where she talks about banning books.
[03:33:28.000 --> 03:33:33.000]  And says, well, we don't have to get that off the books because we haven't ever used it.
[03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:39.000]  Well, then why wouldn't you get rid of it? The Supreme Court justices Scalia and others basically scuriate her on that subject.
[03:33:39.000 --> 03:33:44.000]  I want to tell you about some of the sponsors first that made today's radio broadcast possible.
[03:33:44.000 --> 03:33:55.000]  One of them is Blue Diamond Gusset Jeans. They got jeans, they got shorts, they've got motorcycle jeans that are very affordable that have Kevlar sewed into them.
[03:33:55.000 --> 03:34:01.000]  That's a lot better than leather and a lot cooler. They're made in America, in Tennessee and Georgia.
[03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:05.000]  So a lot of you out there say you want Made in America. These are the best jeans.
[03:34:05.000 --> 03:34:11.000]  Aaron loves them. I bought pairs. They don't rip on you. They're basically double-stitch. Just check it out.
[03:34:11.000 --> 03:34:18.000]  Diamond Gusset. It's Gusset Clothing, G-U-S-S-E-T, clothing. Gusset. Gussetclothing.com.
[03:34:18.000 --> 03:34:26.000]  That's Gussetclothing.com or 888-8Gusset. That's 888-8Gusset. They got motorcycle jeans, especially in the summer.
[03:34:26.000 --> 03:34:31.000]  People are out motorcycling around. They got their whole line of motorcycle jeans. They got regular jeans.
[03:34:31.000 --> 03:34:38.000]  You name it, this is the way to go. Made right here in America. Stop financing your own destruction.
[03:34:38.000 --> 03:34:42.000]  888-8Gusset or Gussetclothing.com.
[03:34:42.000 --> 03:34:49.000]  Lastly, if you don't want to drink all the chlorine and the dead bacteria and the sodium fluoride and all the rest of it,
[03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:55.000]  the little socialist control freaks that started out in Soviet Russia putting fluoride in the water and now here in the U.S.,
[03:34:55.000 --> 03:35:00.000]  that'll learn you scum Americans. You don't love the socialist revolution. We'll just poison your water.
[03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:06.000]  Look at them. They're retarded now. There's nothing they can do to us. We're the little pinhead chicken necks.
[03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:09.000]  Well, if you don't want your kids drinking the poison, these scum are putting in there.
[03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:12.000]  They've got to purewaterfreedom.com. We've got to start hating these people.
[03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:17.000]  They've got to start being right out in the open. They hate us. We've got to stop just mints and words here.
[03:35:17.000 --> 03:35:22.000]  Purewaterfreedom.com. You want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, your whole house.
[03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:28.000]  Purewaterfreedom.com. They have a full line of household fluoride filters. You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home
[03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:35.000]  or you can trust a scum like Elena Kagan because she cares about you and your family with a whole house fluoride system.
[03:35:35.000 --> 03:35:39.000]  By the way, I have the White House Science R's own book about putting stuff in the water to sterilize you.
[03:35:39.000 --> 03:35:45.000]  We're not joking around here. Purewaterfreedom.com. All their filters are made in the USA.
[03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:50.000]  I know that'll upset the globalists because they've got to bring America down first so they can make us all dependent on them.
[03:35:50.000 --> 03:35:57.000]  But if we buy America in it, Purewaterfreedom, that's another good way to stop these creatures. Purewaterfreedom.com.
[03:35:57.000 --> 03:36:06.000]  All right, going back to Larry B. Krav. Larry, start over again. I mean, just see, you've got five minutes closing statements to the jury about Elena Kagan
[03:36:06.000 --> 03:36:12.000]  and you're trying to stop her and people are calling Congress right now and they're calling the media and they're trying to sneak her through.
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:19.000]  The Republicans are playing possum on this. I mean, they're letting it go through. You've got five minutes to address the world.
[03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:23.000]  What would you say to them about Hare Elena Kagan?
[03:36:23.000 --> 03:36:34.000]  She grew up a socialist. She had a radical brother that introduced her to watch a philosophy that was socialism.
[03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:41.000]  She investigated that and found that the radical way of life was to her liking.
[03:36:41.000 --> 03:36:46.000]  Now, that radical way of life is just like everybody that's in favor of communism.
[03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:56.000]  Communism is nothing more than a raw power click at the top of society. They want to steal from the rest of everybody else.
[03:36:56.000 --> 03:37:04.000]  So they go through this brainwashing program. Two of the effect is, well, you have no rights. You don't even have the right to property.
[03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:15.000]  And once you get a populist, this brainwash like that, the ruling elite can take whatever they want and they can do with everybody whatever they please.
[03:37:15.000 --> 03:37:32.000]  That is the ideas that Elena Kagan loves. She loved it so much rather than when she was in school at Princeton wanting to graduate and confronting the task of writing a thesis.
[03:37:32.000 --> 03:37:42.000]  You know, somebody who's going to write a thesis is going to pick a topic that they know they're going to have to investigate and they're going to do something.
[03:37:42.000 --> 03:37:55.000]  They're going to write about something that they like. Elena Kagan picked a history, a little known history of socialism and the march towards socialism in New York.
[03:37:55.000 --> 03:37:59.000]  And she did a pretty good job investigating historical facts.
[03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:07.000]  But when you sit out and read it, you come to the real conclusion that this lady has died in the world of socialism.
[03:38:07.000 --> 03:38:16.000]  And if she wrote that at the age of 21, 22, 23, you notice somebody like that hasn't changed their outlook on the world.
[03:38:16.000 --> 03:38:27.000]  She still really believes in that philosophy. The only thing that's changed is she has matured and her ideas along the same line have only become more profound.
[03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:29.000]  That is Elena Kagan.
[03:38:29.000 --> 03:38:42.000]  And of course, you know, most people, you know, have a red-blooded American man just like you, and we can take a look at certain women and certain men and make a determination as to their sexual propensities.
[03:38:42.000 --> 03:38:45.000]  And that's, of course, what Elena Kagan likes.
[03:38:45.000 --> 03:38:51.000]  So not only is she coming from this socialistic background, she's a legal scholar that she is.
[03:38:51.000 --> 03:38:53.000]  And let me just tell you, Alex, that there's a lot of...
[03:38:53.000 --> 03:39:00.000]  Well, even CBS News said that she was a lesbian, and I mean, the point is, if she is one, why not be honest about it?
[03:39:00.000 --> 03:39:05.000]  Well, I'm not saying anything about it, but I just don't traffic with those types of people.
[03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:06.000]  Well, my issue is that...
[03:39:06.000 --> 03:39:08.000]  You live in the wrong world, but I do not like...
[03:39:08.000 --> 03:39:13.000]  Exactly, but when she was in the Clinton administration, she tried to make all her decisions according to that.
[03:39:13.000 --> 03:39:26.000]  Well, I say, if you take a look at what she...she has that agenda. That is an agenda of a minority here in America. That is not an agenda that is looking out for the best interests of everybody as a whole.
[03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:30.000]  She is in there to pursue her own...to protect her own special interests.
[03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:37.000]  And if you read her 93 and 96 law review articles that she wrote for the University of Chicago Law Review, that is exactly what she wants to do.
[03:39:37.000 --> 03:39:44.000]  It's all she talks about. She's obsessed with it. Instead of cutting my taxes and leaving my private property alone and letting me raise my kids,
[03:39:44.000 --> 03:39:50.000]  she wants to come in and brainwash me and my family. She's obsessed with this issue. That's all she cares about in her.
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:54.000]  And Sonya Sotomayor, I guess, can, you know, go fishing together.
[03:39:54.000 --> 03:39:56.000]  Well, what more can I say, Alex? You just finished it off.
[03:39:56.000 --> 03:39:57.000]  I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:39:58.000]  No, no, no, that's good.
[03:39:58.000 --> 03:39:59.000]  How about the gun issue?
[03:39:59.000 --> 03:40:01.000]  Yeah, oh, yeah. Let's get into that.
[03:40:01.000 --> 03:40:08.000]  You know, two years ago, right about now, we had the Heller decision came out. Now, I followed the Heller decision as it went up,
[03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:12.000]  because a good friend of mine, Dane von Beichenbergardt, with the U.S. Bill of Rights Foundation in Washington, D.C.,
[03:40:12.000 --> 03:40:20.000]  his landlord was Dick Heller. And he's the guy that set up the whole Heller case.
[03:40:20.000 --> 03:40:27.000]  And when they went through it, when they created the factual foundation, they would enable them to go to court to litigate the gun ban.
[03:40:27.000 --> 03:40:31.000]  You know, Dane is the one that set all that up. You ought to get him on the show.
[03:40:31.000 --> 03:40:37.000]  But, you know, I followed all the steps going up through the courts, you know, on the Heller case,
[03:40:37.000 --> 03:40:41.000]  because, you know, I talked to Dane, well, gee, where are things going on with it right now?
[03:40:41.000 --> 03:40:43.000]  And it also resulted in something beneficial.
[03:40:43.000 --> 03:40:48.000]  And that demonstrates that, you know, one of the things the Freedom Movement doesn't do, you know,
[03:40:48.000 --> 03:40:53.000]  we have a lot of people just kind of running around, you know, don't know where to go or what to do.
[03:40:53.000 --> 03:40:59.000]  And here's an illustration of something that was successful. They sat down and planned a legal course of litigation,
[03:40:59.000 --> 03:41:04.000]  and they carefully planned it, and went all the way to the Supreme Court, and guess what? We got the Heller decision.
[03:41:04.000 --> 03:41:12.000]  Now, the same thing with the McDonald's case, you know, they made a very careful litigation strategy that has resulted in another favorable,
[03:41:12.000 --> 03:41:21.000]  you know, to a degree favorable decision. And I certainly concur with you about what the court is indicating,
[03:41:21.000 --> 03:41:27.000]  the limits of the police power, and that's something I want to talk about and mention here in the closing moments of this show.
[03:41:27.000 --> 03:41:32.000]  You know, Alex, if you, you know, I see where the gun rights battle is going to go, I think we're going to have to shift over to,
[03:41:32.000 --> 03:41:36.000]  you know, while we were dealing with the Second Amendment, and really the Second Amendment is going to be incorporated
[03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:41.000]  into the 14th Amendment and made applicable to the states, you know, the Second Amendment, in my view,
[03:41:41.000 --> 03:41:46.000]  is not as powerful as a lot of the state constitutional provisions in the same respect.
[03:41:46.000 --> 03:41:51.000]  So you're saying we've got to, we've got to use the state constitutions against these cities and counties that are out of control?
[03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:57.000]  Absolutely, but the reason why they got to do it up in Chicago is you don't have a constitutional provision in the Illinois Constitution.
[03:41:57.000 --> 03:42:04.000]  But let me read to you the Alabama Constitution, and you will see that this provision is in my view, and I think you'll agree,
[03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:11.000]  that it's stronger than the Second Amendment. It says that every citizen has a right to bear arms and defense of himself and the state.
[03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:18.000]  Now that doesn't have any relationship to the militia, and it also talks about you have the right to bear arms in defense of yourself.
[03:42:18.000 --> 03:42:25.000]  Now the Texas Constitution has raised almost identical, except there, there's an acknowledgement of this thing known as the police power.
[03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:32.000]  I want to discuss the police power in just a second, but the Texas Constitution says every citizen shall have the right to keep
[03:42:32.000 --> 03:42:44.000]  and bear arms in the lawful defense of himself or the state, but the legislature shall have power, by law, to regulate the wearing of arms with a view to prevent crime.
[03:42:44.000 --> 03:42:51.000]  Now, you know, that's second phase right there after the semicolon, you know, but the legislature shall have power.
[03:42:51.000 --> 03:42:58.000]  You know, that's an acknowledgement, that's a real good description, you know, when a lawyer looks at that, it's, ah, you know, that's based on the police power of the state.
[03:42:58.000 --> 03:43:03.000]  Now the police power of the state is something that the patriot movement doesn't know anything about, the freedom movement.
[03:43:03.000 --> 03:43:09.000]  And it's something that we need to really understand the reach and scope of the police power of the state.
[03:43:09.000 --> 03:43:21.000]  And when we sit down and state that subject matter, you'll reach the conclusion that the limits, there, here is one of the limits of the power of the state, the police power of the state,
[03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:33.000]  and the state cannot prevent, there is no lawful authority for government to stop the people from doing something beneficial for themselves.
[03:43:33.000 --> 03:43:46.000]  The police power of the state extends to those things that protect the health, safety and welfare of the state for an activity that would harm the health and welfare or safety of the other people.
[03:43:46.000 --> 03:43:50.000]  You can enact laws, but then again, there's a whole lot of stupid laws.
[03:43:50.000 --> 03:43:57.000]  And they're always using the welfare clause to basically enslave us just like they use, you know, federally the commerce clause.
[03:43:57.000 --> 03:44:06.000]  But here's how I read the decision as a layman, and I will defer to you as a, you know, as a very successful constitutional law scholar and constitutional lawyer.
[03:44:06.000 --> 03:44:17.000]  But I understand that the suits were good, the reasons for the suits were good, the NRA in both briefings went in and added their own amicus briefs that they add on to it,
[03:44:17.000 --> 03:44:22.000]  that basically agreed, we say you can, you know, restrict guns under the law.
[03:44:22.000 --> 03:44:25.000]  You just can't say there's an outright ban here.
[03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:36.000]  And of course, the head of Gunners of America has agreed that overall it can be seen as positive that they didn't just outright say you have no right to a second amendment, turn all your guns in.
[03:44:36.000 --> 03:44:39.000]  But four of the nine did say that in both cases.
[03:44:39.000 --> 03:44:49.000]  But now, I heard Violence Policy Center and Hang on Control Incorporated on TV on radio both saying, oh, this is great for us.
[03:44:49.000 --> 03:44:59.000]  Sure, it says you might have some right under law if the city so chooses basically to let you jump through the red tape to allow some people to have guns in some cases.
[03:44:59.000 --> 03:45:08.000]  But we're now going to use this in other areas to state that we do have this, you have a second amendment, except when a bridge by law.
[03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:19.000]  So they see it as the first time the Supreme Court, in my knowledge, is saying, yeah, you got a second amendment and that second amendment's a right for us to write a bunch of red tape and make it almost impossible.
[03:45:19.000 --> 03:45:33.000]  Well, that's certainly the thrust of the decision itself, that here you have a right and there's a police power regulation that can control that right.
[03:45:33.000 --> 03:45:52.000]  What I am saying in response to that, let me ask you this, Alex, can the government pass a law that if a citizen is attacked by a burglar that the citizen could not defend himself?
[03:45:52.000 --> 03:45:56.000]  No, they cannot restrain you from a right you already have.
[03:45:56.000 --> 03:46:10.000]  That's why we have the right of citizens arrest, which they're trying to eradicate, because it shows inherent in us as the top of the food chain in the governmental system, a government for and by we the people.
[03:46:10.000 --> 03:46:16.000]  Now, they have tried to pass laws like that in Chicago and they're now trying to prosecute people and England does it.
[03:46:16.000 --> 03:46:26.000]  And it shows the government wants the monopoly of force like the mafia, where you've got to go to them to get your insurance and then they don't provide it and the courts have ruled that police have no liability to protect you.
[03:46:26.000 --> 03:46:31.000]  So I believe that they do not have a right to do that and the courts have shown that.
[03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:46.000]  The reason I'm bringing this up is to offer the new ground where it's a new way of thinking, to change everybody's mindsets and start thinking about a different way of looking at your rights.
[03:46:46.000 --> 03:47:00.000]  And if the state simply does not have the right to an act of law that would prevent you from defending yourself when you're attacked by some criminal, if they don't have that power, then where do they have the power to come along and say,
[03:47:00.000 --> 03:47:10.000]  you can't use arms in defense of yourself because the limits of the state government, the government can't harm the people.
[03:47:10.000 --> 03:47:17.000]  Any time that the government comes along and harms the people is acting against this power.
[03:47:17.000 --> 03:47:22.000]  No, no, I totally agree with you. You're absolutely right. And that's a key point you brought up here.
[03:47:22.000 --> 03:47:30.000]  Every statistic shows back in the 60s people were trying to be trendy. It was almost 50-50 pro-gun rights, anti-gun rights.
[03:47:30.000 --> 03:47:37.000]  Now the polls I see are in the 70s or higher. The momentum shifting all the liberals I know are out literally buying guns.
[03:47:37.000 --> 03:47:42.000]  They've broken their conditioning. The gun culture is back and is really growing.
[03:47:42.000 --> 03:47:57.000]  And I think they're horrified and desperately going for everything right now. And I think in their miscalculation and their attempt to really get us down on the ground that they're going to reveal themselves and that we are going to beat these people.
[03:47:57.000 --> 03:48:01.000]  I can feel it. I can see it. What do you see, Larry B. Kraft?
[03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:12.000]  Well, you know, here's what happened in the last couple of years. You know, I've been involved with the organized freedom movement for more than 30 years. I met Tuphersawson back in 1979, Alex.
[03:48:12.000 --> 03:48:16.000]  And I've been with the organized freedom movement ever since. I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly of the freedom movement.
[03:48:16.000 --> 03:48:23.000]  But the movement has grown and then it's been attacked and people have fallen out and gone the way.
[03:48:23.000 --> 03:48:36.000]  But what has changed? And I really want to tell you that I believe Ron Paul really started it. You know, when Ron Paul got his candidacy going, you know, that kicked you know, you can ride around town and people I never knew even knew anything about.
[03:48:36.000 --> 03:48:44.000]  It was a catalyst for the final illusion that we're alone to show us just how powerful we are.
[03:48:44.000 --> 03:48:57.000]  Absolutely. And then I think that that was a critical thing about the Tea Parties. And yes, I would like to thank you. I really do think that we are on the cusp of reasserting our power and moving forward.
[03:48:57.000 --> 03:49:01.000]  But we've got to do it in a very careful, organized way.
[03:49:01.000 --> 03:49:11.000]  And we've got to never stop and we've got to realize it's life and death. I want to play a clip of a Congressman, Congressman King, talking about Obama's birth certificate as we go to break.
[03:49:11.000 --> 03:49:16.000]  We're going to come back and play the Kagan Club of her saying, yes, the government can have laws on the books to ban books.
[03:49:16.000 --> 03:49:20.000]  But here's the birth certificate issue coming up.
[03:49:20.000 --> 03:49:28.000]  For their $44,000, that's their share of the national debt. A little baby with ink on their foot stamped right there on the birth certificate.
[03:49:28.000 --> 03:49:38.000]  There's one in this country we haven't seen, but the footprint on those we have seen, those little babies. Oh, Uncle Sam, $44,000.
[03:49:38.000 --> 03:49:44.000]  You know, regardless of whether he was born in Hawaii or not, and the way they're acting, it looks like Kenya and his grandmother does say it.
[03:49:44.000 --> 03:49:51.000]  We know he was an Indonesian citizen and we know that he had to give up a citizenship to do that. And we know his real name is Barry Sataro.
[03:49:51.000 --> 03:49:56.000]  What are we doing having a president who we can't even figure out his real name?
[03:49:56.000 --> 03:49:59.000]  I mean, I think that was done by design to set a precedent.
[03:49:59.000 --> 03:50:07.000]  Hey Alex, you know, the president is part of the enactment of laws. Congress comes along and passes laws.
[03:50:07.000 --> 03:50:13.000]  It doesn't become a law unless there's a writing of a veto or he didn't take any action.
[03:50:13.000 --> 03:50:19.000]  But he signs off around this legislation. And by his central legislation, it becomes a law.
[03:50:19.000 --> 03:50:31.000]  We ultimately can prove, and I believe that Barry Sataro is not an American citizen, that then becomes an unconstitutional act.
[03:50:31.000 --> 03:50:35.000]  And it has an effect upon every bit of legislation at the federal level.
[03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:40.000]  And that may very well be. And that's the reason why, you know, a lot of these people come along and say,
[03:50:40.000 --> 03:50:48.000]  ah, you don't need to be talking about the birth certificate issue. You know, to me, it's really important because it has an effect upon the legitimacy of the federal government.
[03:50:48.000 --> 03:50:55.000]  If we have somebody that doesn't exercise, there's not a lawful activity at the office, and yet he's participating in enacting laws.
[03:50:55.000 --> 03:51:01.000]  Everything else is a fraud. Larry Beacraft, stay there. Search his name on Larry Beacraft for his website.
[03:51:01.000 --> 03:51:03.000]  Don't answer it.

[03:52:00.000 --> 03:52:06.000]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:52:06.000 --> 03:52:09.000]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[03:52:09.000 --> 03:52:13.000]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:52:13.000 --> 03:52:17.000]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:52:17.000 --> 03:52:22.000]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[03:52:22.000 --> 03:52:26.000]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:52:26.000 --> 03:52:30.000]  Somebody is going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:52:30.000 --> 03:52:31.000]  You are being warned.
[03:52:31.000 --> 03:52:35.000]  We have the facts. We have the Constitution. We have the Bill of Rights. We have common law.
[03:52:35.000 --> 03:52:40.000]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[03:52:40.000 --> 03:52:42.000]  Don't tread on me. Rise the republic.
[03:52:42.000 --> 03:52:47.000]  Terrany is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.

[03:53:00.000 --> 03:53:06.000]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation? Listen.
[03:53:06.000 --> 03:53:11.000]  My name is Ellis and I am 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[03:53:11.000 --> 03:53:14.000]  Two years ago I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[03:53:14.000 --> 03:53:17.000]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[03:53:17.000 --> 03:53:21.000]  They wanted me to go on plavix, but I refused knowing the negative side effects.

[03:54:23.000 --> 03:54:32.000]  This is high treason. This is terrorism. He's on record blocking oil skimming ships.
[03:54:32.000 --> 03:54:38.000]  One that's from Taiwan that can get 500,000 gallons a day.
[03:54:38.000 --> 03:54:45.000]  I mean this is amazing. And it's all being blocked so that it's the biggest disaster possible so we can get the carbon tax.
[03:54:45.000 --> 03:54:49.000]  Don't let a good crisis go to waste. This is high treason. We'll be covering it more tomorrow.
[03:54:49.000 --> 03:54:56.000]  Laurie B crafts our guest but I wanted to play this from the Supreme Court with Elena Kagan, a solicitor general before them,
[03:54:56.000 --> 03:55:02.000]  arguing that the government can have it on the books that they can ban books. Here it is.
[03:55:02.000 --> 03:55:17.000]  If Congress could say no TV and radio ads, could it also say no newspaper ads, no campaign biographies?
[03:55:17.000 --> 03:55:27.000]  The government's view is that although 441B does cover full length books, that there would be a quite good as applied challenge
[03:55:27.000 --> 03:55:37.000]  to any attempt to apply 441B in that context. And I should say that the FEC has never applied 441B in that context.
[03:55:37.000 --> 03:55:41.000]  So for 60 years a book has never been at issue.
[03:55:41.000 --> 03:55:49.000]  What happened to the overbred doctrine? I mean, I thought our doctrine in the First Amendment is if you write it too broadly,
[03:55:49.000 --> 03:55:56.000]  we're not going to pair it back to the point where it's constitutional. If it's overbroad, it's invalid. What happened to that?
[03:55:56.000 --> 03:56:03.000]  I don't think that it would be substantially overbroad, Justice Scalia, if I tell you that the FEC has never applied this statute to a book
[03:56:03.000 --> 03:56:08.000]  to say that it doesn't apply to books is to take off, you know, essentially nothing.
[03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:13.000]  We don't put our First Amendment rights in the hands of FEC bureaucrats.
[03:56:13.000 --> 03:56:19.000]  What if the particular movie involved here had not been distributed?
[03:56:19.000 --> 03:56:26.000]  And of course, you know the federal government tried to stop a movie about Hillary Clinton that was critical of her,
[03:56:26.000 --> 03:56:35.000]  and they did stop it, saying that it criticized her so it was bad. That's what campaign finance reform is.
[03:56:35.000 --> 03:56:39.000]  Restrict our free speech. Let offshore corporations give even more money.
[03:56:39.000 --> 03:56:46.000]  Here's Bloomberg. Banks finalizing Mexico, banks financing Mexico gangs admitted in Wells Fargo deal.
[03:56:46.000 --> 03:56:53.000]  We'll cover this more tomorrow. Bank of America, Wacovia, others just laundering drug money knowingly.
[03:56:53.000 --> 03:56:56.000]  Well, of course, that's why they keep drugs illegal to keep the price up.
[03:56:56.000 --> 03:57:01.000]  But I mean, Larry Becraft, they're now moving into books. They're now moving into speech.
[03:57:01.000 --> 03:57:06.000]  And, you know, here she is saying the bureaucrats should be able to decide if you can write a book or not.
[03:57:06.000 --> 03:57:08.000]  I mean, this woman's a monster.
[03:57:08.000 --> 03:57:13.000]  I don't disagree with you at all. But, you know, what she's saying there when you, she has the mindset.
[03:57:13.000 --> 03:57:20.000]  She sat out and wrote two, you know, two law review articles that are similar in nature with the same philosophy.
[03:57:20.000 --> 03:57:24.000]  You know that that philosophy embeds, you know, is the hardest part.
[03:57:24.000 --> 03:57:31.000]  She says, I get to decide. She says, I'm a good person in her law review and I'll decide.
[03:57:31.000 --> 03:57:35.000]  You can trust me with the power.
[03:57:35.000 --> 03:57:38.000]  Why would you trust the bureaucrat with anything?
[03:57:38.000 --> 03:57:44.000]  Well, I mean, this is insane in our system of government. We trust no one with power that's unconstitutional.
[03:57:44.000 --> 03:57:47.000]  You got that on the hit the nail on the head.
[03:57:47.000 --> 03:57:51.000]  Hey, we've got to get the word out on Elena Kagan.
[03:57:51.000 --> 03:57:54.000]  I don't know whether we're going to have any impact, but you know, let me just say,
[03:57:54.000 --> 03:58:00.000]  everything that you've done, Alex, is going to, is quantum beliefs in the direction we need to go.
[03:58:00.000 --> 03:58:02.000]  And I want to thank you for that.
[03:58:02.000 --> 03:58:07.000]  Well, Larry Becraft, I want to thank you and I have you back very, very soon to cover more of these issues.
[03:58:07.000 --> 03:58:11.000]  God bless you. Just search the term, what, Becraft Briefs?
[03:58:11.000 --> 03:58:14.000]  And that'll find your website for folks that want to check it out.
[03:58:14.000 --> 03:58:16.000]  We'll talk to you again very soon. Everybody should call Congress.
[03:58:16.000 --> 03:58:17.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:58:17.000 --> 03:58:18.000]  Thank you, Larry. Take care.
[03:58:18.000 --> 03:58:22.000]  We need to call Congress. We need to call governors and have them call Congress.
[03:58:22.000 --> 03:58:26.000]  We need to call the media and say, is this the new precedent?
[03:58:26.000 --> 03:58:31.000]  I mean, a little monster socialist who believes you can ban books and who believes they can, quote,
[03:58:31.000 --> 03:58:34.000]  disappear speech and who doesn't believe in the Second Amendment.
[03:58:34.000 --> 03:58:39.000]  I mean, we almost lost our Second Amendment by one vote yesterday.
[03:58:39.000 --> 03:58:49.000]  See you back live tomorrow. Good job, crew.
