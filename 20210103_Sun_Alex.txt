[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  It's Sunday, January 3rd, the year is 2021, where 17 days after the attempted coronation
[00:12.600 --> 00:18.600]  of the Chinese Communist agent, Joe Biden, but suddenly he's canceled the inauguration.
[00:18.600 --> 00:24.640]  They're tearing down the stage. They're tearing down the review stands. Big things are afoot.
[00:24.640 --> 00:28.400]  He's not getting his briefings. And suddenly there's all these senators, all these House
[00:28.400 --> 00:34.000]  members about to challenge the fraudulent five states that violated the law on the face of
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.080]  it and didn't have the legislature pass a law to accept the fraudulent balance.
[00:38.720 --> 00:44.240]  But remember the COVID-19 lockdown, the announcement of COVID camps in blue cities and blue states,
[00:45.360 --> 00:52.000]  all of it flows out of the UN World Government Great Reset in their own words of Klaus Schwab
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.880]  and Bill Gates. So here's a very important four minute report I posted to Band Out video yesterday.
[00:56.880 --> 00:58.720]  I hope you'll share on the Great Reset.
[01:26.880 --> 01:34.560]  Agenda 2030, the planetary plan to end the human system as we know it is here.
[01:35.520 --> 01:41.280]  Nancy Pelosi has announced today that they are officially going to have House rules
[01:42.160 --> 01:48.640]  that legislation cannot have the word father or mother or family or boy or girl.
[01:49.440 --> 01:56.000]  Let that sink in. That's how alien this takeover is. It's telling us we're dirty,
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.640]  we've got to wear a mask, that fathers and mothers are bad, that boys and girls are bad.
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.760]  This is alien any way you look at it. They've come out and said that in a year and a half or
[02:07.760 --> 02:14.800]  30 classify contact with aliens. Is that big stage to make us not believe in God or to tell us the
[02:14.800 --> 02:20.720]  aliens are God? Is it part of the partially classified plan project, Bluebeam? I don't know.
[02:20.720 --> 02:27.920]  But I know this. The cross human animal clones they've been making for 50 years in the class
[02:27.920 --> 02:34.560]  of about 120 have not been shown to the world. They weren't just developed in Petri dishes or
[02:34.560 --> 02:42.400]  testives. They were brought to turn and they're now admitting this. So all the hidden technologies,
[02:42.400 --> 02:48.800]  all the horrors are about to be shown to the world. And in the midst of that, they're coming with an
[02:48.800 --> 02:56.960]  mRNA recombinant mutinogenic system that actually transforms our very cells and rewrites our genetic
[02:56.960 --> 03:02.320]  code and telling us we will take it if we want to buy and sell, have a job or travel or live.
[03:03.680 --> 03:08.240]  Fauci just came out and said force inoculations are on the table. Of course they are. They're
[03:08.240 --> 03:13.680]  going to keep pushing and pushing and pushing. Now, I don't know who these globalists have made
[03:13.680 --> 03:21.440]  a deal with, but what they're setting up is not good for anybody on earth and is anti-human.
[03:21.440 --> 03:27.680]  And that's why I continue to warn you about the NBC and ABC and CBS and Wall Street Journal
[03:27.680 --> 03:33.520]  articles and stories saying humans are dirty and bad, COVID proof that we need to get rid of humans
[03:33.520 --> 03:37.600]  and merge with machines. It's going to be so beautiful and you're going to do it.
[03:37.600 --> 03:46.560]  This is the final revolution. This isn't a Star Trek episode where the Borg cube shows up and says
[03:46.560 --> 03:54.080]  you will assimilate. This is really happening. And so now all the slow-motion beta tests creeping
[03:54.080 --> 03:59.680]  we've seen, the globalist is going into warp speed. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe in a human
[03:59.680 --> 04:04.880]  future. I believe we'll defeat this dystopian vision that the new world war is bringing forth.
[04:04.880 --> 04:10.720]  And I know that God's real and I know that revelation warned us 2,000 years ago about what is now
[04:10.720 --> 04:16.160]  unfolding, but the churches are controlled and they're not going to warn you. So you've got to
[04:16.160 --> 04:19.680]  start reading the Bible. You've got to start praying. You've got to start opening up your
[04:19.680 --> 04:24.400]  soul to God and asking for discernment and God will deliver. And you've got to override the
[04:24.400 --> 04:30.080]  globalist censors and have shut almost everybody else down and tell people about ban.video and
[04:30.080 --> 04:35.120]  infoworks.com. People are ready to hear the truth. The Great Awakening's here. The enemy's making
[04:35.120 --> 04:41.280]  their move. So again, join us weekdays 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tune into the other info wars shows
[04:41.280 --> 04:45.680]  and come to D.C. with us on the 5th and 6th as we expose globalist election fraud. They tend to
[04:45.680 --> 04:50.960]  take our country over. We've only begun to fight. God's on our side. We will win, but the great
[04:50.960 --> 05:01.680]  testing is now here. God bless and good luck. The Great Reset is the end of humanity. The populous
[05:01.680 --> 05:07.360]  movement that elected President Trump four years ago reelected him by an even bigger landslide,
[05:07.360 --> 05:12.560]  rejecting and repudiating and discrediting the globalist. That's why they had to overturn the
[05:12.560 --> 05:17.280]  chessboard. That's why they had to engage in naked election fraud in front of everyone. And as long
[05:17.280 --> 05:22.960]  as we never accept the frauds and results, as long as we don't let them gaslight us into submission,
[05:22.960 --> 05:27.680]  as long as we point out this foreign globalist takeover of our country and that all the depression
[05:27.680 --> 05:33.200]  and all of the collapse that's coming is because of the new world order, this will end up fully
[05:33.200 --> 05:38.400]  destroying them in the future. We don't submit. If we submit, they'll normalize the communism.
[05:38.400 --> 05:42.400]  They'll normalize putting us into a depression. They'll normalize breaking up our families,
[05:42.400 --> 05:47.520]  taking our guns. We can't let that happen. And Info Wars is more important than ever.
[05:47.520 --> 05:52.160]  So please, Paul Revere, I salute you for your past actions. Keep spreading Band-Aid video
[05:52.160 --> 05:58.240]  and infowars.com and come to the big DC marches on the 5th and 6th of January. I'll see you there.
[05:58.240 --> 06:19.840]  God bless. From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:19.840 --> 06:32.240]  It's Sunday, January 3rd. We are in the year 2021 and a global government with a scientific
[06:32.240 --> 06:38.160]  dictatorship and control of it is taking over our planet, our very genetic code. I'm Alex Jones,
[06:38.160 --> 06:43.920]  your host. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having us in your living rooms,
[06:43.920 --> 06:48.720]  in your homes, at your campsites, in your churches, across the world. We are blessed and
[06:48.720 --> 07:00.800]  honored to be here. 17 days until the attempted installation, the installment of Joe Biden.
[07:01.840 --> 07:07.600]  And this truly is the week that will change the world what's coming up on the 6th.
[07:07.600 --> 07:15.120]  Now over 160 House members say they're set to vote to call for a 10-day investigation of the
[07:15.120 --> 07:19.440]  election fraud that's overwhelming. Ted Cruz has now come out and said that that is actually his
[07:19.440 --> 07:25.600]  plan. And then if they find evidence of fraud, the Senate and House will vote to call for a new
[07:25.600 --> 07:31.760]  election in the five states, something I've been pushing for since November 4th, seeing what the plan
[07:31.760 --> 07:39.680]  was. And how did this happen? Well, we let in five key states, actually six states, but the five that
[07:39.680 --> 07:45.120]  Trump needs to win, where he did win, where he was winning by two points, three points, four points,
[07:45.120 --> 07:50.320]  five points, six points, when the polls closed, when they stopped counting in the middle of the
[07:50.320 --> 07:56.160]  night. Well, you can't have them do that without the legislature saying they're going to accept these
[07:56.160 --> 08:03.200]  80 million mail-in ballots. And so on its face, the law was violated, the Constitution was violated.
[08:03.200 --> 08:07.120]  You ask why the Supreme Court has stabbed Trump in the back because they're part of the neocon
[08:07.120 --> 08:14.800]  rhino warmongering group that works for the Democrats. But Mitch McConnell is weak and he's
[08:14.800 --> 08:20.400]  known to be a communist Chinese agent along with his dirtbag wife. And so there's a major fight
[08:20.400 --> 08:27.280]  brewing and history's happening, but they need to see millions of Americans on the fifth and the
[08:27.280 --> 08:32.720]  sixth there in DC. And I've seen people making a lot of excuses, oh, Antifa's dangerous. It's a lot
[08:32.720 --> 08:37.120]  more dangerous walking across the street. There's hardly no Antifa. There are a bunch of cowards. Oh,
[08:37.120 --> 08:40.960]  the hotels are all closed. They're not letting anybody come to DC. I've made the phone calls.
[08:40.960 --> 08:47.120]  That's not true. One hotel with the proud boys had rented out closed. Oh, there's no porta-potties.
[08:47.120 --> 08:51.760]  Really? I'm involved in setting it all up at both events. There are porta-potties by the hundreds.
[08:52.480 --> 08:57.840]  So what you're hearing about, don't go to DC, we're not welcome there. Well, they had told
[08:57.840 --> 09:02.560]  George Washington there were no porta-potties back in 1776. I guess we'd still be a British colony.
[09:03.280 --> 09:08.720]  But there are porta-potties and there are hotels. They went under their stage five lockdown of no
[09:08.720 --> 09:13.600]  restaurants open. But that's what's happening in California. You name it. You can still get food
[09:13.600 --> 09:17.920]  delivered to you or take it with you. This is two days. Everyone needs to be there.
[09:18.720 --> 09:25.200]  Be part of history. Fight for Trump. Fight for America. Find all the details at infowars.com,
[09:25.200 --> 09:31.520]  newswars.com and band.video. And I told you last week it's going to be on the ellipse south of
[09:31.520 --> 09:36.160]  the White House. I told you the president will speak at noon. And then people were like shocked
[09:36.160 --> 09:42.240]  when that was all announced. It's not about info wars getting the credit for this. It's about the
[09:42.240 --> 09:47.360]  fact that no one would step up and put the money in. The federal government doesn't pay for a Trump
[09:47.360 --> 09:52.960]  rally or a Trump event. Donors do. He's been deserted by the donors by the Republican party.
[09:52.960 --> 09:59.280]  So I stepped up and put the money in for the fifth and for the sixth. And then
[10:00.080 --> 10:08.880]  a donor came along, a great patriot, and paid $400,000 plus dollars for the rest of it.
[10:10.240 --> 10:16.560]  I'm in over $130,000. And I'm not complaining about that. I'm putting that out saying there wasn't
[10:16.560 --> 10:24.080]  a magic Q group. There wasn't some secret group at the NSA or the CIA or the FBI or the Justice
[10:24.080 --> 10:29.600]  Department or the Pentagon that went and put the money down for this. I had to do it when no one
[10:29.600 --> 10:36.320]  else was two weeks ago and a week ago. And it already put in more money till I got reimbursed
[10:36.320 --> 10:42.560]  because no one was doing it. So I tell you that to explain to you that America is surrounded by
[10:42.560 --> 10:47.360]  globalists. We're actually very strong or ideology or spirit or connection to God. We have the truth
[10:47.360 --> 10:53.120]  on our side. China joke and barely talk. He has big national events. 1,000 people watch. He can't
[10:53.120 --> 10:57.600]  get 20 people to his events. He's canceling his inauguration. They're pulling down the stands.
[10:57.600 --> 11:03.680]  Trump's not giving him the briefings. The guy is a joke. But they need us. There he is about 10
[11:03.680 --> 11:11.600]  years ago. But they need us. Show him now. But they need us to buy the gaslighting that Trump
[11:11.600 --> 11:15.280]  lost and there's no evidence of fraud and go to sleep when all there is is evidence.
[11:16.480 --> 11:21.200]  And so that's why we're here. Now, I'm not going to bore you with this. Fox News has a big compilation.
[11:22.080 --> 11:28.560]  Democrats who praised 2000 and 2004 objected to electoral college certification. Now slam Senator
[11:28.560 --> 11:34.560]  Holly. And then we've got them objecting in 2016 trying to not let Trump's electors be seated.
[11:35.440 --> 11:39.440]  So it's in the Constitution. They can do it. And if they've got evidence,
[11:39.440 --> 11:45.040]  and if the members of the House and Senate are willing to do this in front of their constituents,
[11:45.040 --> 11:50.160]  which the constituents want, they can overturn the fraudulent election in those five states.
[11:51.680 --> 11:56.080]  And so that's where we are. Are we going to buy their propaganda in their BS? Are we going to say no?
[11:57.040 --> 12:01.600]  And so we have all the videos of them doing this previously. But now they say it's criminal.
[12:01.600 --> 12:04.560]  Now they say it's sedition. Now they say you should be arrested.
[12:04.560 --> 12:10.880]  I've had at National ABC News I was calling me. I've had big Democrat lawyers calling me off record.
[12:11.600 --> 12:15.360]  And so it's off record. I don't say who they are. I'm saying generally who what they work for.
[12:16.160 --> 12:20.560]  So the channel stays open. They're like, why are you coming to DC to be violent? This is scary.
[12:20.560 --> 12:25.440]  You shouldn't challenge this. This is fascist. Be democratic Alex. We never thought you were this
[12:25.440 --> 12:31.120]  evil man. Now come on, save your line for somebody else. It's in the Constitution. It's in
[12:31.120 --> 12:36.640]  the basic strictures of our law. We have massive fraud. These are elected representatives. It's
[12:36.640 --> 12:41.200]  in the Constitution. They're the checks and balances. We want hearings on this. We want a new election.
[12:41.920 --> 12:45.680]  I think it's too much to overturn it and hand it to Trump and forfeit the states,
[12:45.680 --> 12:48.320]  because the public, at least a portion of it's dumbed down, wouldn't get it.
[12:48.880 --> 12:51.440]  But the move to have a commission attend a hearing
[12:53.120 --> 12:56.880]  will clearly show all the massive evidence that's already there. Main Street media and
[12:56.880 --> 13:01.680]  big tech won't be able to hide it. Now we're showing you Biden rallies. Nobody's had them.
[13:02.240 --> 13:06.160]  Say a Trump rallies hundreds of thousands at the big ones, tens of thousands of small ones.
[13:06.880 --> 13:11.520]  And we can point out the Constitution was violated. State legislators were not involved,
[13:11.520 --> 13:16.880]  accepting the mail-in ballots with no signatures, no proof of ID. And we said we have new elections.
[13:16.880 --> 13:22.240]  That's the answer. And Linwood, the lawyer is right. When he says he filed an emergency deal
[13:22.240 --> 13:28.960]  the Supreme Court to block the election on the 5th for those two Senate seats,
[13:31.040 --> 13:35.600]  because they're doing the exact same fraud they engaged in back on November 3rd
[13:35.600 --> 13:41.200]  right now yet again. Let's go ahead and play Ted Cruz talking about how they're calling
[13:41.200 --> 13:46.720]  the Democrats for his arrest for doing what they did four years ago, simply authoritarian.
[13:46.720 --> 13:52.640]  Well, listen, I think everyone needs to calm down. I think we need to tone down the rhetoric.
[13:52.640 --> 13:57.280]  This is already a volatile situation. It's like a tinderbox and throwing
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.480]  throwing lit matches into it. And so I think the kind of hyperbole we're seeing,
[14:02.480 --> 14:06.640]  the kind of angry language, you know, yesterday when I released my statement with with 10 other
[14:06.640 --> 14:16.800]  senators, I had multiple, multiple Democrats urging that that I should be arrested and tried for the
[14:16.800 --> 14:22.480]  crimes of sedition and treason. Now, look, that's not helpful at a time when this country,
[14:22.480 --> 14:28.720]  when we're pitted against each other, just relax and let's do our jobs. We have a responsibility
[14:28.720 --> 14:34.800]  to follow the law. Now, here's Jake Tapper in pure projection, calling this an attempt at a
[14:34.800 --> 14:39.600]  bloodless coup when they've tried this at least four separate times against our populist President
[14:39.600 --> 14:44.720]  Trump. Here it is. What are the president and a big chunk of congressional Republicans focused on?
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.760]  Undermining the results of the election, essentially a bloodless coup leading the
[14:49.760 --> 14:55.280]  Republican Party to a state of turmoil. Saturday 11 Republican senators said they would vote against
[14:55.280 --> 15:00.320]  counting electoral votes in Congress next week, calling for a quote emergency 10 day audit of
[15:00.320 --> 15:07.040]  election returns despite there being, pardon me, despite there being no evidence of widespread
[15:07.040 --> 15:12.080]  voter fraud. The group is following the lead of Senator Josh Hawley, who says he will formally
[15:12.080 --> 15:17.120]  object to Biden's decisive win despite zero credible evidence that would justify such a move. Zero.
[15:17.840 --> 15:22.800]  Senator Ben Sass in Nebraska slammed Hawley and other members of the sedition caucus saying,
[15:22.800 --> 15:27.600]  quote, adults don't point a loaded gun at the heart of legitimate self government.
[15:27.600 --> 15:31.120]  Late Saturday, Senator Mitt Romney said in a blistering statement, quote, that's enough for
[15:31.120 --> 15:35.280]  them. These are all the neocon globalist traders, you know, that tell you we should ban the word
[15:35.280 --> 15:40.000]  mother and father as Pelosi has now done from house debate and law. They will not mention
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.600]  word mother or father now in US law. It is terms of evil. Well, anybody saying mothers and fathers
[15:45.600 --> 15:51.360]  are evil like Mitt Romney and Nancy Pelosi are enemies of humanity and God and will burn in hell.
[15:51.360 --> 16:05.040]  We'll be right back. Stay with us. The year 2021 is almost here. And so we're launching our New
[16:05.040 --> 16:10.160]  Year's specials right now. We've got two different big sales. We've got Super Bowl Vitality Turbo
[16:10.160 --> 16:16.160]  Force and Ultra 12. Part of the New Year's resolution energized pack 40% off. We've got
[16:16.160 --> 16:21.920]  bodies, vaso beats and knockout. Part of the New Year's resolution revitalized pack at 40% off.
[16:21.920 --> 16:28.160]  But if you get both of these packs together, they are 60% off with free shipping and double
[16:28.160 --> 16:33.040]  patriot points. The best deal ever. I want to thank you all for your support and encourage you to go

[16:37.760 --> 16:42.960]  info war. Again, get the great products infowarstore.com and fund the second American Revolution
[16:42.960 --> 16:49.600]  worldwide at a time that it's more critical than ever. Again, the year 2021 is here and I am
[16:49.600 --> 16:54.080]  committed to you to fight against the globalist harder than ever. So thank you so much for keeping
[16:54.080 --> 17:02.560]  info war in the fight without your support. We couldn't do any of it. The word apocalypse
[17:02.560 --> 17:10.240]  means the revealing of what was once hidden. And now that all the lies are being revealed,
[17:10.240 --> 17:18.720]  what will you do? We know that millions will do absolutely nothing. They will do whatever they
[17:18.720 --> 17:26.480]  are told as if obedience is a virtue. It is the Patriots of the world versus everybody else.
[17:27.680 --> 17:34.480]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States
[17:34.480 --> 17:41.600]  against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same,
[17:41.600 --> 17:48.240]  that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion. And
[17:48.240 --> 17:56.160]  that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can. So help me God infowarstore.com
[17:56.160 --> 18:05.920]  The populist movement that elected President Trump four years ago reelected him by an even bigger
[18:05.920 --> 18:11.920]  landslide rejecting and repudiating and discrediting the globalist. That's why they had to overturn
[18:11.920 --> 18:16.640]  the chessboard. That's why they had to engage in naked election fraud in front of everyone. And as
[18:16.640 --> 18:21.840]  long as we never accept the frauds and results, as long as we don't let them gaslight us into
[18:21.840 --> 18:26.400]  submission, as long as we point out this foreign globalist takeover of our country and that all
[18:26.400 --> 18:31.280]  the depression and all of the collapse that's coming is because of the new world order, this
[18:31.280 --> 18:37.040]  will end up fully destroying them in the future. We don't submit. If we submit, they'll normalize
[18:37.040 --> 18:41.280]  the communism. They'll normalize putting us into a depression. They'll normalize breaking up our
[18:41.280 --> 18:47.120]  families, taking our guns. We can't let that happen. And info wars is more important than ever.
[18:47.120 --> 18:52.240]  So please Paul Revere's I salute you for your past actions. Keep spreading band off video and info
[18:52.240 --> 18:57.840]  wars.com and come to the big DC marches on the fifth and sixth of January. I'll see you there.
[18:57.840 --> 19:05.280]  God bless. Inflation is here and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming, especially
[19:05.280 --> 19:10.480]  if the globalists are successful in killing the dollar. Tens of millions of Americans that were
[19:10.480 --> 19:16.640]  not awake are now beginning to store food. That's a good thing, but it's going to drive up prices
[19:16.640 --> 19:22.640]  and we're already beginning to see record sales once again. We the people understand it's up to
[19:22.640 --> 19:28.080]  us to protect ourselves. It's up to us to become self sufficient. The globalist are waging seeds
[19:28.080 --> 19:33.280]  against us, trying to destroy our businesses, trying to bankrupt our families, our towns,
[19:33.280 --> 19:38.880]  our churches. That's why while we still can, you've got to get prepared and get ready. Take
[19:38.880 --> 19:46.080]  advantage of a huge final mega sale before prices go up and prepare with Alex.com and save up to
[19:46.080 --> 19:53.040]  $850 off the highest quality storeable foods out there. You've got until Friday, January 8th
[19:53.040 --> 19:58.720]  to get your orders in and prepare with Alex.com and lock in the lowest prices out there on high
[19:58.720 --> 20:15.840]  quality storeable food. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption
[20:15.840 --> 20:21.120]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[20:24.240 --> 20:30.960]  They're censoring infowars.com and newswars.com and banned not video on Twitter, Facebook and
[20:30.960 --> 20:35.280]  Google and all the other channels, but also censoring US Senate and the fraud hearings they
[20:35.280 --> 20:39.680]  had in the last few weeks showing pure evidence of election fraud saying, oh, we don't allow the
[20:39.680 --> 20:45.520]  American people to see that. You don't get to see your Senate hearings. Well, we have a new URL,
[20:45.520 --> 20:51.760]  I'm sure they'll ban it in a week or two, but it's the resistance dot video, the resistance
[20:53.200 --> 20:59.760]  dot video. That is the new URL that you can share and get out to everyone, you know, because it is
[20:59.760 --> 21:05.520]  a fight to not just Oh, they're censoring us. Oh, they're suppressing us. Oh, we just go away. We
[21:05.520 --> 21:11.680]  just shut up. We just quiet ourselves. No, we redouble our efforts because they're not silencing
[21:11.680 --> 21:17.760]  us because we're weak. They're silencing us because the truth will defeat them. But I forget
[21:17.760 --> 21:21.280]  that internet meme has been around for 10 years. No one knows who created it, but
[21:23.200 --> 21:28.800]  they wouldn't be engaging in all this propaganda if they weren't losing is basically what it comes
[21:28.800 --> 21:34.880]  down to. Okay, let me just roll through this. Somebody through the huge COVID global government
[21:34.880 --> 21:43.840]  martial law news that is unfolding the checkpoints, the digital IDs, the forced inoculations,
[21:43.840 --> 21:48.400]  the secret camps where they take you and put a tube down your lungs and then turn it up on high
[21:48.400 --> 21:54.160]  and murder you. The new guillotine is the ventilator. That's not just in Australia or that's not just
[21:54.160 --> 22:04.560]  in Canada, in Quebec. That's not just in Spain. That's now here. That's the live feed show headline
[22:04.560 --> 22:13.040]  today. Deals with that Sunday live. Dems prepare to activate COVID camps if Biden captures White House.
[22:14.960 --> 22:20.560]  And that has been their goal all along is no due process, absolute control. And I'm going to show
[22:20.560 --> 22:27.440]  you where the UN, where NIH officials in the UK, where Canadian officials, where U.S. officials
[22:27.440 --> 22:32.320]  all say communist China is our goal. In fact, when I do that next segment, guys,
[22:32.320 --> 22:44.960]  guys, will you pull in Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau a few years ago saying on TV, they said,
[22:44.960 --> 22:50.240]  what's your favorite model of government? And he said, dictatorship. I love communist China.
[22:50.880 --> 22:55.280]  It turns out he's on the communist Chinese payroll. He's got Chinese troops training in
[22:55.280 --> 23:01.280]  Canada, but you need to see this for yourself because he's just being honest about what Agenda
[23:01.280 --> 23:06.640]  2030 is about, what the Great Reset is about. And he also said, we're using COVID to bankrupt the
[23:06.640 --> 23:12.480]  middle class and end the way of life in the West as we know it. And he commits to that on video.
[23:12.480 --> 23:18.480]  So we'll show you that coming up next segment. Great job, crew. You pulled it up in mere seconds.
[23:20.000 --> 23:26.320]  This is coming up next segment, but let's just get back into this. Democrats who praised 2004
[23:26.320 --> 23:32.160]  objections to electoral college now slam Senator Holly and Senator Cruz saying they're criminals
[23:32.160 --> 23:37.040]  that need to be arrested. Senator Cruz, members of Congress have a third option when it comes to
[23:37.040 --> 23:42.960]  certifying the election to call for a 10-day audit to actually hear the evidence of the fraud,
[23:42.960 --> 23:46.880]  but they are constitutionally meant to see, not to mention the legislature is never passing a
[23:46.880 --> 23:53.280]  law to allow the fraudulent 80 million ballots. That's what we need, not just buying the gas
[23:53.280 --> 23:58.000]  lighting that, oh, Trump lost. Oh, Biden won. Zero evidence of fraud.
[24:00.640 --> 24:07.680]  Mother and father is bad. Joe Biden has giant crowds. After weeks of silence, lawsuits,
[24:07.680 --> 24:13.120]  Pitt says he welcomes January 6, electoral college challenge, and has canceled his European
[24:13.120 --> 24:23.360]  and Israeli vacation. So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, a major sign that there are major cracks
[24:23.360 --> 24:31.440]  in the whole gas lighting facade of, oh, no, there's no voter fraud or election fraud ever
[24:31.440 --> 24:37.840]  anyway in America. Continuing, we already play this clip. CNN's Tapper says Republicans
[24:37.840 --> 24:44.560]  objecting to Biden is a bloodless coup. Again, total projection, what they've done before. Republican
[24:44.560 --> 24:50.320]  efforts to undermine Biden victory exposed growing anti-democratic streaks of CNN. Today,
[24:50.880 --> 24:55.600]  they said that, but they were the ones calling four years ago for the very same procedure,
[24:55.600 --> 25:02.880]  which they did do, but had no votes. NBC's Chuck Todd, a GOP senator on electoral college,
[25:02.880 --> 25:09.440]  you are the arsonist here. We'll play that clip in a moment with Senator Ron Johnson
[25:10.560 --> 25:16.000]  of Wisconsin. It's over. A bipartisan group of senators rebuked voter fraud claims.
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.960]  All the three or four neocon senators like Mitt Romney and them just say, oh, this is
[25:20.960 --> 25:27.520]  open and shut. It's all done. And as I mentioned, Representative Tom Cole, Nancy Pelosi's house rules
[25:27.520 --> 25:32.160]  are blatant and cowardly assault. Dark day for free debate. She says, you know, you're not allowed to
[25:32.160 --> 25:35.920]  insult a member of the house. You're not allowed to say the N word in the house. That sounds reasonable.
[25:35.920 --> 25:40.400]  But now you're not allowed to sell mother, father, child, boy, girl. Those are all dirty words,
[25:40.400 --> 25:48.880]  according to her house rules. I'm not joking. That's real. We must win. The Patriots must win.
[25:48.880 --> 25:53.920]  I agree with John Hall, the civil war over the heart and soul of the GOP. That's why we go to
[25:53.920 --> 26:00.080]  DC and we never accept Joe Biden. We never accept the fraud, the Chai Khan agent. And we let them
[26:00.080 --> 26:04.960]  know that we've only begun to fight. We don't submit to their illegality and their fraud and
[26:04.960 --> 26:09.520]  they're bringing in illegal aliens to vote and openly having that done in all these states and
[26:09.520 --> 26:14.960]  handing out driver's license so they can vote. And so dead people can vote. No, we understand the
[26:14.960 --> 26:21.600]  truth and we will never surrender to you. We will never back down. Since I mentioned it, here is
[26:21.600 --> 26:27.440]  a part of that clip. Chuck Todd with GOP Senator Electoral College Challenge. You are the arsonist
[26:27.440 --> 26:32.720]  here. Here it is. Senator, I want to quote Senator Ben Sasse for you, because what you're
[26:32.720 --> 26:37.600]  alleging is essentially you and your colleagues have created this controversy. So right now we
[26:37.600 --> 26:42.640]  are locked into a destructive, vicious circle in some ways as you kind of outlined, except which
[26:42.640 --> 26:47.120]  is you made an allegation that there was widespread fraud. You have failed to offer specific evidence
[26:47.120 --> 26:52.160]  of that widespread fraud, but you're demanding an investigation on the grounds that there are
[26:52.160 --> 26:58.720]  allegations of widespread fraud. So essentially, you're the arsonist here. President Trump is the
[26:58.720 --> 27:04.800]  arsonist here. You've started this fire and now you're saying, whoa, look at this. Oh my god.
[27:04.800 --> 27:10.560]  All these people believe what we told them because you didn't have the guts to tell the truth that
[27:10.560 --> 27:18.240]  this election was fair. Chuck, this fire was started back in January of 2017. People like
[27:18.240 --> 27:23.840]  Mark Zade in his tweet, the coup has started first of many steps, rebellion and impeachment to
[27:23.840 --> 27:29.680]  follow ultimately. This was started when the mainstream media stopped, dropped any pretense of
[27:29.680 --> 27:35.200]  being unbiased and actually chose sides during this election. This fire was started when you
[27:35.200 --> 27:39.600]  completely ignored, for example, our investigation of Hunter Biden. You know, no evidence wrong
[27:39.600 --> 27:42.960]  doing there. And now we find out after the election, no, there is fair amount of evidence.
[27:42.960 --> 27:47.920]  It's the Democrats that said, we're not going to accept the red mirage when it looks like Trump won.
[27:49.040 --> 27:52.960]  And we're going to fight this. And even if he wins, we're not going to accept the inauguration.
[27:52.960 --> 27:56.560]  We're going to have a new inauguration and Joe Biden will be the president. I say Trump should
[27:56.560 --> 28:01.600]  do that because the media and the globalist and big tech and all of them are telling us this big
[28:01.600 --> 28:09.360]  lie. Remember, they closed at about one o'clock in the morning on average, one, one 32 o'clock,
[28:09.360 --> 28:19.280]  Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona. And then magically when they said,
[28:19.280 --> 28:22.800]  we're not counting anymore, everybody goes home. People are like, well, wait, you said it was
[28:22.800 --> 28:28.000]  closed on record. Why did it all spike for Biden? We have the video of them pulling out the suitcases
[28:28.000 --> 28:32.960]  and weird chai comm agents coming in in Michigan, 4am. And then suddenly just boom, boom, boom,
[28:32.960 --> 28:37.200]  they were still counting when they were closed. It's open and shut. It's like the banks closed.
[28:37.200 --> 28:42.800]  Why are people loading bags of money into trucks outside? It's a robbery. It's a robbery. And Trump
[28:42.800 --> 28:48.480]  tweeted out the video of this, pissing off the globalist. Wow, so much to do in the 17 days.
[28:49.440 --> 28:55.520]  It was 79 days of hell. We told you this was coming. Now there's 17 days left and the 79 days of hell
[28:55.520 --> 29:03.120]  will be right back. The pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate
[29:03.120 --> 29:08.240]  alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course,
[29:08.240 --> 29:12.560]  the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally
[29:12.560 --> 29:19.120]  a chip under your skin. It's all now completely official. Part of the UN great reset of the Debo
[29:19.120 --> 29:24.560]  Scoop and Cloud Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller
[29:24.560 --> 29:30.080]  Foundation, all the rest of them, a 10 to 21, a 20 to 30, it's here and only gets worse like being
[29:30.080 --> 29:37.280]  fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all. And the rejection starts with
[29:37.280 --> 29:42.480]  realizing it's spiritual battle, diversity, evil and stopping abortion. We must start
[29:42.480 --> 29:48.880]  valuing human life again. We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable,
[29:48.880 --> 29:56.080]  that we are essential. Until we do that, we are all slaves. We must stand up and declare our basic
[29:56.080 --> 30:03.840]  God given human rights now. Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would.
[30:03.840 --> 30:08.560]  They've always been part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse. If they're able
[30:08.560 --> 30:14.640]  to keep Trump from rightfully taking office for a second term on January 20th, the system is going
[30:14.640 --> 30:19.520]  to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic. They are going to explode gas prices.
[30:19.520 --> 30:22.880]  They're going to shut down our coal power plants. They're going to cut off the energy
[30:22.880 --> 30:28.320]  source to the US. So it's impossible for factories to move back here. This is economic domination.
[30:28.320 --> 30:32.800]  This is economic war. We are being consolidated. We are being taken over. The democrats aren't
[30:32.800 --> 30:37.280]  mismanaging their blue cities and states. They're consolidating power and control
[30:37.280 --> 30:42.240]  to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership
[30:42.240 --> 30:47.120]  of all the infrastructure and property. This is a monopolistic takeover. That's what the great
[30:47.120 --> 30:52.320]  reset is. Klaus Schwab and these other criminals admit it. That's what social distancing is.
[30:52.320 --> 30:58.000]  So your business is only a 25% for several more years. No small businesses will be there.
[30:58.000 --> 31:04.400]  This is a master plan. Say no. Our activated charcoal toothpaste became a best seller overnight
[31:04.400 --> 31:09.040]  because activated charcoal is already one of the top selling fastest growing toothpaste out there.
[31:09.040 --> 31:13.520]  The problem is a lot of the other over the counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring
[31:13.520 --> 31:17.840]  very, very toxic and also they have fluoride in it. This does not have the fluoride. It doesn't
[31:17.840 --> 31:22.480]  have the additives. This is a concentrate. It really is high quality. It's been sold out for
[31:22.480 --> 31:26.720]  months because of supply chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage.
[31:26.720 --> 31:32.960]  But now it's back in stock. Info wars. Dr. Jones Naturals activated charcoal toothpaste.

[32:00.160 --> 32:05.760]  The populist movement that elected President Trump four years ago reelected him by an even bigger
[32:05.760 --> 32:11.760]  landslide rejecting and repudiating and discrediting the globalist. That's why they had to overturn
[32:11.760 --> 32:16.080]  the chess board. That's why they had to engage in naked election fraud in front of everyone.
[32:16.080 --> 32:21.440]  And as long as we never accept the fraudulent results, as long as we don't let them gaslight us
[32:21.440 --> 32:25.920]  into submission, as long as we point out this foreign globalist takeover of our country and
[32:25.920 --> 32:30.800]  that all the depression and all of the collapse that's coming is because of the new world order,
[32:30.800 --> 32:36.240]  this will end up fully destroying them in the future. We don't submit. If we submit, they'll
[32:36.240 --> 32:40.480]  normalize the communism. They'll normalize putting us into a depression. They'll normalize
[32:40.480 --> 32:45.600]  breaking up our families, taking our guns. We can't let that happen. And info wars is more
[32:45.600 --> 32:50.560]  important than ever. So please, Paul Revere's, I salute you for your past actions. Keep spreading
[32:50.560 --> 32:56.720]  band.video and info wars.com and come to the big DC marches on the fifth and sixth of January.
[32:56.720 --> 32:58.160]  I'll see you there. God bless.
[32:58.160 --> 33:06.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:28.160 --> 33:51.280]  Welcome back. I'm your host Alex Jones on this live Sunday transmission every day, every hour.
[33:51.280 --> 33:56.640]  So precious right now as a global specter move on humanity. Coming up next segment, I'm going to hit
[33:56.640 --> 34:02.880]  the Democrats announcing concentration camps for conservatives. They said they're going to send
[34:02.880 --> 34:07.520]  out the billable and the Gates Foundation, the Clinton Foundation on plenty of the clubs of the
[34:07.520 --> 34:12.800]  contact tracers, that little computer they program. And then if you don't submit to a test, you go to
[34:12.800 --> 34:17.360]  a camp. And then of course, once you're someone on their list, the computers pre programmed,
[34:17.360 --> 34:22.960]  you will then have to go to the facility, you'll be intubated with a ventilator and murdered.
[34:22.960 --> 34:26.880]  And that's by the way, it's already happening. You saw the state rep they grabbed,
[34:27.520 --> 34:32.720]  who'd run for Congress and won. And then they grabbed him, intubated him, killed him in the
[34:32.720 --> 34:37.840]  procedure, and then said it was COVID-19. Jeffrey Epstein's cellmate to the day he died.
[34:37.840 --> 34:42.400]  I was found dead in this house. They said that was COVID-19. So this is how they murder you now
[34:43.760 --> 34:48.720]  is saying it's COVID-19. This is their big criminal revolution. This is their excuse to
[34:48.720 --> 34:54.560]  round you up and arrest you. That's coming up next segment. And then mainstream news,
[34:54.560 --> 35:01.920]  this is even in Reuters. Lockdown proponent Bill Gates, quietly funding plan to dim the sun's
[35:01.920 --> 35:08.000]  rays by Jared Airplane, Spring, and Limit of the Oxide out in their jet fuel. Now we've covered
[35:08.000 --> 35:14.320]  this for 20 years. It was Gates funded a Nobel Prize in 92, the scientist that built the plan.
[35:14.320 --> 35:18.480]  And they've been doing it. You notice Kim Trails went down the last few years. Trump killed the
[35:18.480 --> 35:25.280]  program. They'll be back now, don't worry. So it's all being announced. He controls your weather.
[35:25.280 --> 35:29.520]  He controls your diet. He controls what goes in your body. He controls everything because,
[35:30.880 --> 35:35.600]  well, he's the new world order. I want to find out about old Billy Boy Gates. That's coming up.
[35:35.600 --> 35:41.840]  And I'll show you the former CIA director, Brennan, four years ago, five years ago when he was still
[35:41.840 --> 35:48.800]  in the CIA, admitting they are geoengineering already, but in beta. It's like about you come
[35:48.800 --> 35:54.080]  into your bedroom and I'm having sex with your wife. I go, it's okay, Ralph. It's beta testing.
[35:55.840 --> 35:59.680]  Or I go over to your house and beat you in the head with a ball peen hammer to death. And I go,
[35:59.680 --> 36:04.320]  it's okay, David. It's okay, John. It's just a beta test.
[36:04.320 --> 36:12.240]  What Bill Gates said a few months ago in Colbert, he said, oh, Colbert's just a drill.
[36:12.240 --> 36:21.040]  The real thing's coming. And they're mad scientists. Think Dr. Evil, but the real world.
[36:23.120 --> 36:28.240]  So that's all coming up. That's all coming up next hour.
[36:28.240 --> 36:36.160]  But let's go ahead and go to what would happen if the senators vote
[36:38.080 --> 36:44.320]  with the majority to hold up the electoral college and have a 10 day hearing.
[36:48.080 --> 36:51.280]  And that would constitutionally bring them up to right before the 20th, which has been done
[36:51.280 --> 36:58.480]  twice before to have hearings. Well, then big tech and everybody wouldn't be able to override it and
[36:58.480 --> 37:07.280]  censor. And then you'd see how these actually 10 states, but five account went and engaged in fraud.
[37:09.120 --> 37:14.000]  And the legislature didn't pass a law to take mail-in ballots with no ID or no proof or no
[37:14.000 --> 37:22.160]  signature. And you look at those states, 500,000, 200,000, 300,000 people voted twice. And it was
[37:22.160 --> 37:27.600]  always for Joe Biden. When they find all these truckloads of torn up ballots, it's always Trump
[37:27.600 --> 37:34.240]  ballots. The criminals are stealing it in front of God and country in front of the whole world,
[37:34.240 --> 37:41.120]  but people are waking up very, very quickly. So one American news put out this report. Trump
[37:41.120 --> 37:47.040]  retweeted it. It's up on infowars.com and newswars.com. I suggest you share it. That's how we override
[37:47.040 --> 37:52.720]  the censors. But here's part of that report showing the fraud, the clear fraud in Georgia. Here it is.
[37:53.680 --> 37:59.040]  After pulling out hidden boxes stuffed with ballots, footage analyzed by Gateway Pundit
[37:59.040 --> 38:05.280]  reveals Freeman apparently scanning the same stack of ballots over and over again.
[38:05.280 --> 38:10.720]  Surveillance cameras show these poll workers watched and waited until the GOP observers
[38:10.720 --> 38:14.880]  and reporters had left the room before they resumed scanning their ballots.
[38:16.160 --> 38:20.800]  I hit pause and back it up to the beginning. Yeah, they said a water main busted. They kicked
[38:20.800 --> 38:25.120]  everybody out. I watched their all footage. And then they look around like Wiley Cowell,
[38:25.120 --> 38:32.160]  when he's got a sheep on his back or your kids in the cookie jar. And they pull out black suitcases
[38:32.160 --> 38:38.480]  from underneath the and then start, I mean, and they're both Democrat operatives. And it just
[38:38.480 --> 38:44.800]  gets worse from there. Here, sorry, go ahead and roll the report. After pulling out hidden boxes
[38:44.800 --> 38:50.560]  stuffed with ballots, footage analyzed by Gateway Pundit reveals Freeman apparently scanning the
[38:50.560 --> 38:56.960]  same stack of ballots over and over again. Surveillance cameras show these poll workers
[38:56.960 --> 39:02.960]  watched and waited until the GOP observers and reporters had left the room before they resumed
[39:02.960 --> 39:08.560]  scanning their ballots. These four workers then continued counting uninterrupted for over three
[39:08.560 --> 39:14.400]  hours until sometime after one in the morning. During this time, Ruby Freeman, as seen here in
[39:14.400 --> 39:21.120]  this video, repeatedly scanned the same batch of ballots at least three times, which is highly
[39:21.120 --> 39:27.200]  illegal. And it's all captured on tape. Freeman was working with her daughter, Andrea Moss,
[39:27.200 --> 39:32.480]  who was also her election supervisor, and was also caught on camera as one of the four workers
[39:32.480 --> 39:37.760]  who remained behind after election monitors were forced to leave the building. George's officials
[39:37.760 --> 39:42.960]  have made serious efforts to dismiss the evidence presented on these videos. But so far, there has
[39:42.960 --> 39:50.000]  been no explanation as to why Ruby Freeman scanned the same ballots multiple times, nor why they
[39:50.000 --> 39:56.640]  remained behind while the rest of the building was evacuated. Lawyers said it's highly unusual for
[39:56.640 --> 40:02.720]  anyone to store briefcases full of ballots under tablecloths, and it's not clear when those briefcases
[40:02.720 --> 40:08.720]  were delivered or why Ruby Freeman and her daughter waited until GOP observers left before
[40:08.720 --> 40:14.640]  they got them out. Based on the number of ballots observed in the briefcases and the number of times
[40:14.640 --> 40:20.080]  Ruby Freeman scanned the same set of ballots, experts say they could easily account for the
[40:20.080 --> 40:27.680]  sudden and mysterious spike in votes for Joe Biden. Pearson Sharpe, One America News. That's not a
[40:27.680 --> 40:32.720]  spike. That's a mega spike. But of course, Twitter is trying to block the president getting this out.
[40:32.720 --> 40:38.560]  The full video is posted to band.video. I suggest you share it. I suggest you override the enemy at
[40:38.560 --> 40:44.480]  the resistance.video, the new URL, that the enemy is not yet blocking. But speaking of that, yeah,
[40:44.480 --> 40:50.720]  there's new HD footage up close of her scan the same ballots, felonies each time over and over
[40:51.440 --> 40:56.240]  and over again. But after all, Trump's Hitler, so he deserves it, even though George Soros is
[40:56.240 --> 41:00.800]  funding them, who actually work for Hitler. Let's roll this little clip. This is just part of it.
[41:00.800 --> 41:08.080]  It's a three minute clip of Democrats in 2004, 2000, calling to block electoral colleges,
[41:08.080 --> 41:11.360]  votes in the Senate House. Now they call it fascism. Here it is.
[41:11.360 --> 41:17.280]  The chair now hands to the tellers the certificate of the electors for president
[41:17.280 --> 41:22.160]  and vice president of the state of Florida. Mr. President, the objection is in writing,
[41:22.160 --> 41:28.080]  signed by a number of members of the House of Representatives, but not by a member of the Senate.
[41:28.080 --> 41:32.320]  Mr. President, I stand for the purpose of objecting to the counting of the vote
[41:32.320 --> 41:37.920]  from the state of Florida as read. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of the
[41:37.920 --> 41:44.560]  Congressional Black Caucus to object to the 25 electoral votes from Florida. Mr. President,
[41:44.560 --> 41:49.920]  thank you for your inquiry. It isn't writing. It is signed by myself on behalf of my diverse
[41:49.920 --> 41:54.640]  constituents and the millions of Americans who have been disenfranchised by Florida's
[41:54.640 --> 41:59.440]  inaccurate vote count. Is the objection signed by Senator? Well, Mr. President,
[41:59.440 --> 42:05.760]  I am objecting to the idea that votes in Florida were not counted. Clerk will report the objection.
[42:05.760 --> 42:11.920]  Mr. President, we, a member of the House of Representatives and a United States Senator,
[42:11.920 --> 42:18.000]  object to the counting of the electoral votes of the state of Ohio on the ground that they were
[42:18.000 --> 42:25.920]  not under all of the known circumstances regularly given, signed Stephanie Tubbs-Jones,
[42:27.200 --> 42:34.480]  state of Ohio, Barbara Boxer, state of California. The objection today is raised.
[42:34.480 --> 42:39.200]  Okay, so it goes on, and it goes on, and it goes on. The point is they're acting like this is
[42:39.200 --> 42:43.760]  illegal now, running around and eating, saying, how dare they do any of this? And it's all pure
[42:43.760 --> 42:48.160]  crap. They're a bunch of chai-com, globalist agents. They have chips on their shoulders in
[42:48.160 --> 42:53.040]  8 America. And if we just simply stand up and stop buying their crap, stop following their orders,
[42:53.040 --> 42:57.040]  they will be defeated like phantoms at dawn. Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[42:57.040 --> 43:04.960]  The populist movement that elected President Trump four years ago re-elected him by an even
[43:04.960 --> 43:10.640]  bigger landslide, rejecting and repudiating and discrediting the globalist. That's why they had
[43:10.640 --> 43:15.040]  to overturn the chessboard. That's why they had to engage in naked election fraud in front of
[43:15.040 --> 43:20.080]  everyone. And as long as we never accept the fraudulent results, as long as we don't let
[43:20.080 --> 43:24.640]  them gaslight us into submission, as long as we point out this so foreign, globalist takeover
[43:24.640 --> 43:29.280]  of our country and that all the depression and all of the collapse that's coming is because
[43:29.280 --> 43:34.880]  of the new world order, this will end up fully destroying them in the future. We don't submit.
[43:34.880 --> 43:39.280]  If we submit, they'll normalize the communism. They'll normalize putting us into a depression.
[43:39.280 --> 43:43.920]  They'll normalize breaking up our families, taking our guns. We can't let that happen.
[43:43.920 --> 43:48.880]  And Info Wars is more important than ever. So please, Paul Revere, I salute you for your past

[45:58.080 --> 46:04.480]  true 360 win. It's not a secret why and leftist controlled cities all over the world, not just
[46:04.480 --> 46:09.520]  the U.S. They encourage people to live in tents. Cities is homeless and they use drugs and alcohol
[46:09.520 --> 46:14.880]  and engage in petty crime. It's because the globalists admit under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030,
[46:14.880 --> 46:19.760]  of course, the great reset, they want to lower expectations. They don't want you to think of
[46:19.760 --> 46:23.600]  having sanitary systems everywhere. They don't want you to think of a civilization that gets
[46:23.600 --> 46:28.240]  better. They want you to think of civilization that gets progressively worse. The globalists
[46:28.240 --> 46:33.760]  fly around in private jets. They have huge private mistakes. They are separate from us. Their children
[46:33.760 --> 46:39.280]  go to private tutors. They admit this. Now they want us locked down, telecommunicating with each
[46:39.280 --> 46:45.200]  other so that we are not actually out physically building a pro-human infrastructure. The infrastructure
[46:45.200 --> 46:50.960]  that's left under 5G has been to control robot autonomous cars and trucks. This is all their
[46:50.960 --> 46:55.680]  admitted plan. The public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta. It's gone
[46:55.680 --> 46:59.120]  operational. It's a post-human future. You better find out about it right now.
[46:59.120 --> 47:09.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:13.440 --> 47:22.480]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[47:22.480 --> 47:28.160]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[47:30.160 --> 47:34.160]  Well, when I was growing up as a child, I thought about politics. I thought about science. I thought
[47:34.160 --> 47:38.240]  about the world. I thought about the nature of the universe. And I thought everybody else was
[47:38.240 --> 47:43.840]  thinking like I was. But they weren't. Most people were looking at things one-dimensionally,
[47:44.400 --> 47:49.360]  according to whatever they were being pre-programmed with. So then I began to research, well,
[47:49.360 --> 47:52.560]  how the world really worked. And I found out there are people that know how it works,
[47:53.280 --> 47:57.920]  but they use that knowledge to control and enslave humanity, not empower humanity.
[47:59.280 --> 48:06.800]  And as I became prominent, as I became effective, exposing them, like I was a baseball card or a
[48:06.800 --> 48:24.480]  Pokemon card, people like Roger Ailes, because he never hid the fact that he did that, and others came along to collect me like I was a piece of memorabilia, a Mickey
[48:24.480 --> 48:33.280]  Mail, Babe Ruth, baseball. But I wasn't for sale. And so many others had groomed themselves and prepared
[48:33.280 --> 48:41.040]  themselves, and had done everything to try to ingratiate themselves with this group of mummies.
[48:43.040 --> 48:53.360]  I love that quote written by Oliver Stone from Scarface, which is a composite of true stories.
[48:53.920 --> 48:59.840]  And he's sitting there at the fancy restaurant. He goes, is this it? You end up here like a mummy.
[48:59.840 --> 49:05.840]  You got a bag for a belly. And all you need to point your finger at me and you go, look,
[49:06.400 --> 49:10.240]  look, there's the bad guy. He goes, so say good night to the bad guy.
[49:16.160 --> 49:21.920]  I believe in you. I mean, here's the thing. I've come to the realization of this.
[49:21.920 --> 49:29.440]  Instead of power making me be megalomaniacal, power has made me upset and depressed. But
[49:29.440 --> 49:34.880]  I've really come to the realization, as the Bible tells us with great knowledge, comes great sorrow,
[49:35.280 --> 49:42.400]  that info wars and what we do and our guests and our worldview is the most accurate thing on the planet.
[49:42.400 --> 49:50.960]  And we really do have the keys to a future destiny that is one trillion percent better
[49:50.960 --> 49:55.440]  than what the globalist had planned for everybody. And so that's really what it comes down to here.
[49:56.800 --> 50:03.360]  I'm selling iced tea in the fricking Sahara Desert. By the way, it's free.
[50:06.080 --> 50:10.640]  If I'm going to be free, you're going to be free. So, you know, I did a lot of research
[50:10.640 --> 50:16.320]  last few days, like I always do. And I'm sitting here ready to take you over the mountain
[50:17.120 --> 50:25.520]  and lay out what they're about to do. But I got to tell you something.
[50:29.520 --> 50:35.120]  None of this other stuff matters. All the little side issues are the NBA or the NFL
[50:35.120 --> 50:43.680]  or Brad Pitt. None of that means anything to the globalist. They care about your will and
[50:43.680 --> 50:47.920]  where your intention is focused and what you believe in and your destiny. And they want
[50:47.920 --> 50:52.640]  you to be hopeless. They want you to be alone. They want you to think you're cut off from God
[50:52.640 --> 50:59.680]  and you're not. And I really don't want to see you destroyed. But you can be convinced to join
[50:59.680 --> 51:06.000]  with this thing because you have free will. But just because you don't have the money
[51:06.000 --> 51:13.120]  or the power in their system, never feel like you're a loser. You're a winner because you
[51:13.120 --> 51:19.120]  have a connection to God. And I think at the end of the day, that's really the main statement
[51:19.120 --> 51:25.440]  I want to make to you, is I've been around some of the richest people in the United States
[51:25.440 --> 51:29.360]  and I've been around some of the biggest Hollywood names in the United States because
[51:29.360 --> 51:34.560]  they tried to seduce me into it. And it didn't matter how good the food was, how beautiful
[51:34.560 --> 51:42.480]  the women was. It didn't matter how cool the jet ride was. Man, I felt cold and alone and separate
[51:42.480 --> 51:49.520]  from God. And my spirit was telling me, get out of here, get out of here, get out of here.
[51:49.520 --> 51:55.440]  Get out of here. But I can go to some fishing village in Italy or some farm in South Texas
[51:56.720 --> 52:00.880]  or I can go to some old black lady's house or I can go to some old white woman's house
[52:00.880 --> 52:07.120]  or I can go to some young as long as they got God and I feel totally fulfilled. And so it's the
[52:07.120 --> 52:12.960]  spirit that fulfills, not commercialism, not the system, not all of this you got to understand.
[52:12.960 --> 52:20.880]  And when you look at 60 Minutes that's attacking me tonight and you look at all these people and
[52:20.880 --> 52:26.080]  you look at them and when you look at them they're plastic, they're like mannequins, they're not even
[52:26.080 --> 52:34.080]  real. And you got to feel sorry for them that they're cut off from God, but you got to just
[52:34.080 --> 52:41.280]  move on and you got to try to find the people and they could be old, they could be young,
[52:41.280 --> 52:48.080]  they could be black, they could be Hispanic, Asian white, they could be gay, they could be
[52:48.080 --> 52:53.920]  straight, they could be anything. But if their spirit wants to resist this evilness takeover,
[52:53.920 --> 52:59.360]  then they're good people we should support. But at this point we've reached in the universe and
[52:59.360 --> 53:04.880]  this point we've reached in time, if you're begging people to listen to you and they're laughing at
[53:04.880 --> 53:10.960]  you and they think it's funny, plant the seed and move on because we need to be looking for the people
[53:10.960 --> 53:16.800]  that actually want the truth and want to understand what's happened. Because we're reaching the end
[53:16.800 --> 53:24.560]  game here where things are going to progressively get so bad that people double down, quadruple down
[53:24.560 --> 53:31.200]  and just keep doubling down on it's got to get better. Oh, the lockdown, the Great Depression,
[53:31.200 --> 53:36.400]  it was caused because you didn't wear a mask. Oh, the hundreds of millions starving to death,
[53:36.400 --> 53:41.040]  it was caused because you wouldn't take the vaccine when it's the very group running at
[53:41.040 --> 53:45.840]  all that wants to kill the third world, the very group running at all that says they want to do
[53:45.840 --> 53:51.200]  this. And they've just got the third world where they want them. They want you to think, oh, we're
[53:51.200 --> 53:56.640]  just wiping out those Latin Americans and those blacks, those Africans and we're just walking,
[53:56.640 --> 54:00.720]  we're wiping out those poor people over there. Don't worry, you're not part of that. You're
[54:00.720 --> 54:07.520]  especially who he wants. With a hyper competitive satanic kingpin like Bill Gates,
[54:10.080 --> 54:17.280]  he hates everybody, including himself. He wants to homicidally murder every person he comes across.
[54:18.560 --> 54:23.280]  You can watch his actions, his moves, what he says, what he does, and then you could dial into
[54:23.280 --> 54:31.120]  his spirit and it's a homicidal demon that just loves depression and death. He talks about global
[54:31.120 --> 54:42.880]  depression, starvation. He starts smiling and wiggling in his seat because he's a demon.
[54:44.560 --> 54:50.560]  So get this through your head. You have an energetic soul, 100% it's all been proven,
[54:50.560 --> 54:55.680]  the enemy knows this, none of them are atheist. They know your soul is super ancient, super
[54:55.680 --> 55:02.000]  incredible, some older than others and they want to manipulate that because you've got extreme power
[55:03.120 --> 55:08.320]  and if they can get you captured under their control, they can use you as a power source
[55:09.280 --> 55:18.080]  for things they're doing. And so you need to break with them and say, you don't have my fear,
[55:18.080 --> 55:24.480]  you don't have my envy, you don't have my pain, you have nothing, all I have is love and they
[55:24.480 --> 55:31.040]  can't pick up that power. And so when you expose their fraud at a restaurant with a stupid mask
[55:31.040 --> 55:35.360]  or a business, wherever you do it through love, and I'm speaking myself because I get angry at man,
[55:37.440 --> 55:43.760]  and you stand against him and you realize no weapon formed against us will prosper as long
[55:43.760 --> 55:49.520]  as we take action. But these really are the cosmic collaborators, these are the bad people.
[55:50.960 --> 55:56.480]  These are the folks that are absolutely hell bent on destruction and pain and dishonor and
[55:56.480 --> 56:03.600]  annihilating individual free will and creation, the spark of Genesis that God gave us, little G,
[56:03.600 --> 56:12.000]  little God, in our circumference of our soul is the potentiality of the universe. A man,
[56:12.000 --> 56:19.120]  a woman coming together is even more powerful and they can build to the future. And so the enemy
[56:19.120 --> 56:25.520]  hates the sacred right of the woman and the man and the child and what they build. They hate the
[56:25.520 --> 56:34.560]  sacred right of us in our ancestry and our current state and our grand future that isn't about our
[56:34.560 --> 56:40.640]  personal ego, but is about building greater universes through God's will and sharing God's
[56:40.640 --> 56:46.160]  consciousness upon the universe and being a focal point of God's will and a focal point of God's
[56:46.160 --> 56:52.400]  consciousness that must be tested and must be strong and must be ready to take on that power.
[56:53.680 --> 57:00.080]  You must reject the power of Satan, which is a lie. You must accept the power of Christ
[57:00.080 --> 57:07.840]  and you must rebuke it in the name of Christ and through that flows the entire future of our species.
[57:07.840 --> 57:13.360]  We thank God for all that is good. We thank God for consciousness. We thank God for the future
[57:13.360 --> 57:19.200]  and we thank God for every moment of breath and everything God has given us and we are transcendent,
[57:19.200 --> 57:25.600]  committing ourselves through free will to Christ's energy and his father's control for eternity.
[57:25.600 --> 57:31.120]  We are with you in eternity and we love you God and we praise you and Satan has been broken
[57:31.120 --> 57:37.120]  by your son's great sacrifice. If you know God wouldn't put us through this if God didn't
[57:37.120 --> 57:41.840]  go through it himself and God is real. All right, I'll cover the latest COVID lockdown,
[57:41.840 --> 57:47.120]  new world order takeover, the pathetic operations of Satan. When we start the second hour, stay with us.
[57:49.120 --> 57:57.920]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden and now that all the lies are
[57:57.920 --> 58:06.880]  all the lies are being revealed. What will you do? We know that millions will do absolutely nothing.
[58:06.880 --> 58:14.560]  They will do whatever they are told as if obedience is a virtue. It is the patriots of the world
[58:14.560 --> 58:22.800]  versus everybody else. I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the constitution of
[58:22.800 --> 58:29.680]  the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and
[58:29.680 --> 58:36.880]  allegiance to the same, that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose
[58:36.880 --> 58:44.160]  of evasion and that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can. So help me
[58:44.160 --> 58:57.280]  God. How are you doing, Alex? Man, I'm just working as hard as I can. We're in such a critical time.
[58:57.280 --> 59:03.360]  Brother, how are you? I love you, man. I want to make a quick plug that DNA force. I love it. I've
[59:03.360 --> 59:08.400]  been using it quite a while and I just went looked at the ingredients again the other day and I see
[59:08.400 --> 59:15.440]  that it contains quercetin which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited
[59:16.160 --> 59:23.200]  is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells. So
[59:23.200 --> 59:29.280]  people might want to take a look at that. All I know is with DNA force we went out and looked at
[59:29.280 --> 59:34.080]  these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the
[59:34.080 --> 59:37.920]  doctor itself like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only
[59:37.920 --> 59:43.200]  cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's
[59:43.200 --> 1:00:08.880]  what produced this. So thanks. Thanks for the plug. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:08.880 --> 1:00:14.640]  How fitting that illegitimate president-elect Joe Biden attempts to roll into the Oval Office
[1:00:14.640 --> 1:00:20.000]  as Congress robs the taxpayers of America. As Roosevelt said I think the American people
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:24.880]  can take whatever we tell them if we tell them straight from the shoulder. If it were any other
[1:00:24.880 --> 1:00:30.160]  president-elect the media would be in a feeding frenzy to get to the bottom of the monumental
[1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:35.920]  criminality the Biden family unleashed on the Ukraine instead they're covering it all up.
[1:00:35.920 --> 1:00:42.080]  President Trump has said publicly Joe Biden and his son are stone cold corrupt and chances are
[1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:47.600]  he's watching this interview. Anything you want to say to him. Yeah Mr. President release your
[1:00:47.600 --> 1:00:52.880]  tax returns. Let's see how straight you are okay old buddy. It's amazing that it has gone this far.
[1:00:52.880 --> 1:00:58.960]  We are actually witnessing the possibility of an incoming president that faces a class A felony
[1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:04.640]  for fleecing a foreign government while he was vice president. The now month old Ukrainian press
[1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:10.000]  conference laid out the facts accusing the Bidens of high treason against the Ukrainian government
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:15.840]  as the Biden syndicate colluded with the corrupt Ukrainian president Victor Yanukovych through
[1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:21.520]  his minister barisma founder Mikola Zlochevsky. According to the Ukrainian prosecutor's evidence
[1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:27.680]  the Bidens were involved in embezzling U.S. dollars intended for technical assistance to Ukraine
[1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:33.840]  funneling millions out of Ukraine's coal and gas industry and the withdrawal of millions of dollars
[1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:38.880]  laundered through corrupt banks that were transferred to the Biden family. Evidence of the
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:43.840]  withdrawal through financial holes of millions of dollars stolen from the Ukrainian people
[1:01:43.840 --> 1:01:49.200]  with their subsequent transfer to the accounts of the company belonging to the Biden family.
[1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:54.560]  At one of the first press conferences about a year ago we showed bank transactions for hundreds
[1:01:54.560 --> 1:01:59.840]  of thousands of dollars to the family of former U.S. vice president Joe Biden namely to his son
[1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:04.720]  Robert Hunter Biden. The latter was a member of the board of directors of the infamous gas
[1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:11.440]  production company barisma. Barisma belongs to the fugitive Yanukovych era minister Mikola Zlochevsky.
[1:02:11.440 --> 1:02:16.880]  The inclusion of Biden in the barisma leadership and payment for his services is nothing more than
[1:02:16.880 --> 1:02:23.680]  a political cover that protected Zlochevsky from the Ukrainian law namely from the criminal code.
[1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:30.480]  Two anonymous witnesses detailed the transactions that they were intricately involved in.
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:35.200]  Yes I confirm what was said in the conversation today the company was operating from about
[1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:42.000]  2009 to legalize and optimize clients funds. In this situation we are talking about Mikola Zlochevsky
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:47.360]  and barisma holdings limited. Transactions were made in his favor the transfer of funds to barisma
[1:02:47.360 --> 1:02:52.000]  holdings limited came from the two companies mentioned above and barisma paid its bills.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:57.280]  In this situation it paid to the Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC account with Morgan Stanley.
[1:02:57.280 --> 1:03:04.080]  And what can you say about Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC. The company was owned by Hunter Biden.
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:10.080]  In the period from November 2014 to October 2015 the witnesses noticed strange reoccurring
[1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:14.880]  payments that at the direction of Zlochevsky's assistant were sent from the account of barisma
[1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:20.240]  holdings limited which was open for the personal needs of Mikola Zlochevsky in the Latvian private
[1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:26.400]  bank AS. To the account of the American company Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC the witnesses drew
[1:03:26.400 --> 1:03:31.680]  attention to these payments since about 20 times the same uneven amount was reoccurring
[1:03:31.680 --> 1:03:39.280]  83,333.33 cents. This is a payment for the political cover that Biden provided to Zlochevsky.
[1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:44.240]  This is only part of the payments for a short period confirmed with documents by the witnesses.
[1:03:44.240 --> 1:03:49.520]  And it was also confirmed by the reports of the financial intelligence units of Latvia,
[1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:55.120]  Cyprus and Ukraine which are posted on the NABU leaks website and how much was paid to
[1:03:55.120 --> 1:04:00.480]  security officials, tax officials, lobbyists and how much was stolen. I think the amount is tens
[1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:06.080]  of millions of dollars. Add to the Ukrainian government findings all of the puzzle pieces
[1:04:06.080 --> 1:04:12.800]  supposedly being investigated by the deep state immunity keystone cops over at the FBI regarding
[1:04:12.800 --> 1:04:19.200]  Hunter Biden's laptops documenting the telltale signs of a money laundering operation as the
[1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:24.560]  American conservative wrote. The laptop shows Hunter through a number of front companies
[1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:30.240]  accepted money from Chinese and Ukrainian entities and move that money to the U.S. where it was
[1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:34.640]  parceled out to other. All right, this is a very important report. There's about a minute
[1:04:35.760 --> 1:04:43.040]  or more left on it. Biden's Ukrainian felony. That's at Bandat video. So I hope that folks
[1:04:43.040 --> 1:04:47.680]  get that out there. Yeah, it's got 68,000 views in the last day. That's great. The enemy hates that,
[1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:54.160]  but he's had a million views. So it's at band.video, band.video. We'll be right back in 60 seconds
[1:04:54.160 --> 1:05:01.120]  with the forced inoculations and emergency FEMA camps. The populist movement that elected President
[1:05:01.120 --> 1:05:07.360]  Trump four years ago reelected him by an even bigger landslide, rejecting and repudiating and
[1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:11.920]  discrediting the globalist. That's why they had to overturn the chessboard. That's why they had to
[1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:17.440]  engage in naked election fraud in front of everyone. And as long as we never accept the frauds
[1:05:17.440 --> 1:05:21.840]  and results, as long as we don't let them gaslight us in the submission, as long as we point out
[1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:26.720]  this foreign globalist takeover of our country and that all the depression and all of the collapse
[1:05:26.720 --> 1:05:32.400]  that's coming is because of the new world order, this will end up fully destroying them in the
[1:05:32.400 --> 1:05:37.280]  future. We don't submit. If we submit, they'll normalize the communism. They'll normalize putting
[1:05:37.280 --> 1:05:42.400]  us into a depression. They'll normalize breaking up our families, taking our guns. We can't let
[1:05:42.400 --> 1:05:47.360]  that happen. And info wars is more important than ever. So please, Paul Revere's, I salute you for
[1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:53.120]  your past actions. Keep spreading band off video and info wars.com and come to the big DC marches
[1:05:53.120 --> 1:06:17.920]  on the fifth and sixth of January. I'll see you there. God bless. It's January 3rd on this Sunday
[1:06:17.920 --> 1:06:30.000]  live transmission. The year is 2021. I'll be back live tomorrow, Lord willing. 11am to 3pm,
[1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:38.000]  right after American Journal, the call in show. We did mornings 8am. And of course, I'll
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:43.600]  ensure the war room that I'm going to get on a jet airplane and fly to Washington DC
[1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:50.960]  for the fireworks. I suggest you go. I suggest you be there on the fifth, the freedom plaza where
[1:06:50.960 --> 1:06:56.480]  I'm speaking and on the sixth, where I'll also be speaking there before the president on the
[1:06:56.480 --> 1:07:01.600]  elliptic there south of the White House. And we already covered that in the first hour,
[1:07:01.600 --> 1:07:07.360]  but let's go ahead and get into this right now. There comes a point in a military attack
[1:07:07.360 --> 1:07:13.920]  where you have to breach the surface. Back during World War II, submarines weren't very good with
[1:07:13.920 --> 1:07:20.640]  torpedoes, but they had deck guns. And so there's a point where the submarine surfaces to start
[1:07:20.640 --> 1:07:27.040]  firing at the ship it wants to hit normally wants to shoot off the ship's rudder so we can capture
[1:07:27.040 --> 1:07:32.720]  the ship. That's even better. And America has had its rudder basically shot off. That's the
[1:07:32.720 --> 1:07:36.960]  demoralization. That's the attacking the country. That's the teaching us to hate ourselves.
[1:07:42.160 --> 1:07:43.040]  But I remember
[1:07:45.680 --> 1:07:52.240]  10 months ago getting a Montreal, Canada document where they were planning martial law,
[1:07:52.240 --> 1:07:58.000]  emergency COVID centers, lockdowns, secret arrest, contact tracers, and people said,
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:03.840]  Oh, is that a real law? Well, I just search engine what was in the document and found it in public
[1:08:03.840 --> 1:08:09.440]  documents. It was real. But people couldn't believe, Oh, they're not going to come arrest me and claim
[1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:14.000]  a computer says I have COVID, even though it's 96% false positive. And I'm going to take me to a
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:20.320]  secret medical facility. That's like in some John Carpenter science fiction horror movie.
[1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:29.120]  And now in Europe, in Australia, in the UK, in Canada, and in the United States,
[1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:36.480]  they have passed laws are in the process of passing laws to have contact tracers
[1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:41.360]  who are run by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and or the Clinton Foundation.
[1:08:41.360 --> 1:08:46.640]  Look it up. I mean, I showed the videos months ago, six months ago, 10 months ago we first
[1:08:46.640 --> 1:08:52.960]  broke this saying, Oh, it's a new thing for our democratic people to do. Folks that got
[1:08:52.960 --> 1:08:56.800]  college degrees, they're going to go to your house, you're going to be tested. If you don't do
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:02.400]  what we tell you, you're going to go to a facility. So Bill Clinton's always been a rapist, but this
[1:09:02.400 --> 1:09:09.600]  is the next level of the rate. So here's the headline for the show today. Sunday Live Dems
[1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:20.480]  Prepare to Activate COVID Camps at Biden Captures White House. And then we've got all the reports
[1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:27.200]  and all the admissions of it in mainstream news. But let's look at some more headlines. Bill Gates,
[1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:31.840]  bars and restaurants should be shut down for six months. It's always another month, another two
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:37.760]  months or six months. And now he says it may continue in 2022. Oh, he said it would end in late
[1:09:37.760 --> 1:09:45.200]  2021. Oh, now he says it's the next year. Oh, it's always another year. And the actual UN
[1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:50.560]  documents, they say you'll never shake hands. You'll never stop wearing a mask. You'll be
[1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:56.080]  genetically tested daily by computers with whatever the new virus is. So you're just
[1:09:56.080 --> 1:10:02.480]  totally captured on the horns of this hysteria. Even though all the studies show more bacteria,
[1:10:02.480 --> 1:10:07.920]  more viruses is good for your overall immune system. They're telling you be scared of yourself.
[1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:12.400]  Humans are bad. Get rid of humans. Wear a mask. You're dirty. Because he's famous for wanting
[1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:17.280]  to depopulate the earth. I mean, oh, what's Bill Gates want? Oh, did he populate the earth? Oh,
[1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:21.840]  but he's running this response. Yeah, he's my doctor. I didn't ask for him. He's not a doctor,
[1:10:21.840 --> 1:10:28.640]  but that's just the way it is. Here's the RT article. It's in the New York Post. It's in Reuters.
[1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:34.880]  It's in AP. COVID camps. They put a question mark on it. Well, there's no question mark
[1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:41.440]  that killed that footage we played yesterday of the resting people for having more than five people
[1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:48.960]  in Canada at a New Year's party. Pull that up. COVID camps put disease carriers and attention
[1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:57.440]  centers, proposes New York law. Alarming number of US healthcare workers are refusing COVID-19
[1:10:57.440 --> 1:11:04.240]  vaccine, depending on the poll, 50 to 81 percent. There's the footage. Oh, you've got more than
[1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:08.400]  five people here. We're arresting you. The cops then slam his head in the concrete. He bleeds
[1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:17.920]  everywhere. And the cops look like lunatic demons that escape from hell. California reports 45,000
[1:11:17.920 --> 1:11:24.640]  new coronavirus cases as surge continues into the New Year. They've locked down for 10 months.
[1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:29.600]  They've bankrupted the local businesses, but box stores are open. But magically,
[1:11:29.600 --> 1:11:35.360]  they're the worst hit in the country because the public submitting there. It's not about death.
[1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:43.200]  It's about, oh, the COVID numbers. The inventor of the PCR test said it's 90 plus percent fake
[1:11:44.080 --> 1:11:49.280]  if you do it normally, but they turn it up where everyone is guilty. So the cops show up
[1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:55.840]  with the Clinton global initiative. They're like, hi, we heard your neighbor said you were coughing
[1:11:56.400 --> 1:12:00.960]  or you were at a store next to somebody according to an app that said you were exposed.
[1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:04.720]  When you talk to you, oh, no, I don't want to talk to you. Boom. They bust down your door.
[1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:10.560]  They grab you. They snake a robot up your nose. And it says you're guilty. And now you're in an
[1:12:10.560 --> 1:12:19.200]  anti-for-run facility with the modern guillotine, the ventilator, and you're going to die just like
[1:12:19.200 --> 1:12:25.280]  the Republican Congress when they got elected. He came in with sniffles. They intubated him and
[1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:33.680]  killed him. Good. Oh, it was beautiful. David Amit now. Well, he was innovated. He had a heart attack
[1:12:33.680 --> 1:12:39.040]  while we did it. Sram, don't worry. We love you. We're liberal. We run death camps in China. Apple
[1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:44.880]  runs death camps. It's liberal. Tim Cook's gay. It's okay. California report, more than 45,000
[1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:53.600]  new coronavirus cases and surge continues in the new year. Look at this. These former nurses were
[1:12:53.600 --> 1:12:58.400]  asked to leave retirement and return to the front lines because the hospitals are so full.
[1:12:58.400 --> 1:13:05.280]  And then you go show in California and Texas and New York and London and in Deutschland
[1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:12.160]  and Berlin and they're empty, empty, empty. But they're returning to the front lines. It's like
[1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:19.680]  World War II. Well, it is. The Nazis are killing us. But wait, large numbers of healthcare workers
[1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:26.400]  are refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. I was talking to one of my security guys today. He's a nice guy.
[1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:31.440]  He knows a bunch of EMS workers. He was showing me their comments to him. And they're told,
[1:13:31.440 --> 1:13:36.800]  take the vaccine, you get like a $700 or $1,000 bonus when you do it. And they get it and they're
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:42.960]  all getting COVID two to five days later. And I told them, I said, wait till the second round. Oh,
[1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:47.680]  they're going to hurt you bad. Because they're giving you an autoimmune response to a normal
[1:13:47.680 --> 1:13:52.240]  cold virus. You'll have no immune system after this. You're like, why would they do that? Because
[1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:57.440]  it's a China-com global stakeover. Why would Hitler bomb London? Why would the Soviets take
[1:13:57.440 --> 1:14:04.720]  over countries? Because you're under attack because they think you're weak. Large numbers of
[1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:08.000]  healthcare workers and frontline workers are refusing COVID-19 vaccine.
[1:14:11.200 --> 1:14:16.480]  Physician in Mexico admitted to intensive care unit receiving Pfizer vaccine. Oh,
[1:14:18.480 --> 1:14:24.320]  guess who Professor Lockdown got his ideas from? Communist Chinese trained. The main expert over
[1:14:24.320 --> 1:14:29.120]  the UK lockdown was Communist Chinese trained. They're open for business. We aren't. They're
[1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:34.400]  bragging. They run the whole hysteria and that will quote, never reopen and that the US is
[1:14:34.400 --> 1:14:41.520]  quote, dead. Because China locked down things properly. They get to reopen, but we didn't do
[1:14:41.520 --> 1:14:47.760]  a job. We never reopened. Jaw-dropping new CDC figures suggest true US coronavirus
[1:14:47.760 --> 1:14:54.000]  toll approaching a half a million. Really, they told me 2.5 and then 2.3 and then 2.2 would all
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:15:01.520]  be dead in March by May. But none of it was true. They're counting all the motorcycle accidents
[1:15:01.520 --> 1:15:08.960]  and all the car racks and all the skydiving accidents and all the cancers and all of the
[1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:14.160]  viral infections of pneumonia and everything. They're counting that, that, that, that.
[1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:22.480]  Another fake number. It's World War three says LA County doctor. Be set by intensely sick COVID-19
[1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:27.840]  patients. All the homeless people bombed out of their brains on fentanyl. They go to the CDC's
[1:15:27.840 --> 1:15:33.120]  own website. They admit LA's about 15% capacity, but they tell you they're overwhelmed. Liars,
[1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:40.320]  liars, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies. Once a model of California now struggles,
[1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:45.040]  the same COVID-19, when you bow down to it, when you give in, when you wear the mask, when you
[1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:52.320]  believe the fraud, the martial law gets worse. It doesn't get better. An American psycho. Nancy
[1:15:52.320 --> 1:16:02.480]  Pelosi's aid to camp smiles on with pleasure. The year 2021 is almost here. And so we're launching
[1:16:02.480 --> 1:16:07.120]  our New Year's specials right now. We've got two different big sales. We've got SuperMail
[1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:13.680]  Vitality TurboForce and Ultra 12, part of the New Year's Resolution Energize Pack, 40% off.
[1:16:13.680 --> 1:16:18.720]  And we've got Bodies, Vaso Beats and Knockout, part of the New Year's Resolution Revitalize Pack
[1:16:18.720 --> 1:16:25.200]  at 40% off. But if you get both of these packs together, they are 60% off with free shipping
[1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:29.920]  and double Patriot points, the best deal ever. I want to thank you all for your support and
[1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:34.800]  encourage you to go to infowarstore.com today and take advantage of this and you can't lose
[1:16:34.800 --> 1:16:39.600]  because it funds the Info War. Again, get the great products at infowarstore.com and fund the
[1:16:39.600 --> 1:16:44.960]  Second American Revolution worldwide at a time that it's more critical than ever. Again, the year
[1:16:44.960 --> 1:16:50.800]  2021 is here and I am committed to you to fight against the globalist harder than ever. So thank
[1:16:50.800 --> 1:17:15.600]  you so much for keeping Info Wars in the fight. Without your support, we couldn't do any of it.
[1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:21.600]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is. You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News,
[1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:25.840]  doctors say it's worse than they ever thought. COVID more devastating than you'd ever imagine.
[1:17:26.480 --> 1:17:32.000]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago, within three
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:38.240]  months. Okay, it's a quarter million. If you count all of the people that died of other things,
[1:17:38.240 --> 1:17:42.720]  we're talking 96% at co-morbidity. These are real numbers. These are real facts.
[1:17:42.720 --> 1:17:46.960]  This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses, never come out and are taught
[1:17:46.960 --> 1:17:51.360]  we're not essential. All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet. Rebuke it,
[1:17:51.360 --> 1:17:56.640]  stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[1:17:58.320 --> 1:18:03.520]  The populist movement that elected President Trump four years ago re-elected him by an even
[1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:09.200]  bigger landslide, rejecting and repudiating and discrediting the globalist. That's why they had
[1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:13.600]  to overturn the chessboard. That's why they had to engage in naked election fraud in front of
[1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:18.800]  everyone. And as long as we never accept the fraudulent results, as long as we don't let them
[1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:23.920]  gaslight us into submission, as long as we point out the so far in globalist takeover of our country
[1:18:23.920 --> 1:18:28.960]  and that all the depression and all of the collapse that's coming is because of the new world order,
[1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:34.400]  this will end up fully destroying them in the future if we don't submit. If we submit, they'll
[1:18:34.400 --> 1:18:38.880]  normalize the communism. They'll normalize putting us into a depression. They'll normalize breaking
[1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:44.320]  up our families, taking our guns. We can't let that happen. And Info Wars is more important than
[1:18:44.320 --> 1:18:49.680]  ever. So please, Paul Revere's, I salute you for your past actions. Keep spreading band.video
[1:18:49.680 --> 1:18:55.760]  and infowars.com and come to the big DC marches on the 5th and 6th of January. I'll see you there.
[1:18:55.760 --> 1:19:10.160]  God bless. The resistance.video, the resistance.video, the resistance.video, the resistance.video,
[1:19:10.160 --> 1:19:20.080]  the resistance.video, infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video and hundreds of other URLs we've
[1:19:20.080 --> 1:19:27.600]  launched have been banned. That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:36.560]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail. But the new website is the resistance.video,
[1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:42.960]  the resistance.video. They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[1:19:42.960 --> 1:19:48.400]  So the new URL that links right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:53.600]  and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is that the resistance.video.
[1:19:53.600 --> 1:19:57.440]  Share the link, the resistance.video, the resistance.video.
[1:19:57.440 --> 1:20:15.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:28.240 --> 1:20:36.720]  You can hear it. We've been waiting for the numbers. We've been tracking them closely.
[1:20:38.160 --> 1:20:44.480]  John Hopkins back in late September crunched the numbers and said it appears roughly the same
[1:20:44.480 --> 1:20:53.440]  number of Americans have died year to date in the year 2020 as died in the year 2019.
[1:20:53.440 --> 1:21:02.560]  But we were waiting for the CDC a few days into the new year, the third day of the new year to
[1:21:02.560 --> 1:21:09.040]  release the numbers. It has happened. And we have the numbers year to date right here
[1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:16.800]  from the year 2010 to the year 2020. And it's the same number almost every year,
[1:21:16.800 --> 1:21:31.040]  0.9 in 2020, 0.9 in 2019, 0.9 in 2018, 0.9 in 2017, 0.9 in 2016, 0.8. Now,
[1:21:31.040 --> 1:21:37.360]  you notice right here and this shows input mortality is up. Suicide is up.
[1:21:37.360 --> 1:21:46.240]  Drug overdose is up. And those three factors starting in about 2015 or so
[1:21:47.600 --> 1:21:54.640]  are causing our death rate to go up. But the same amount of Americans died,
[1:21:54.640 --> 1:22:09.440]  breaking. CDC reports same amount of Americans died in the year 2000 as died in 2019.
[1:22:10.160 --> 1:22:16.000]  What a bombshell fact because when three months ago, year to day,
[1:22:17.920 --> 1:22:24.400]  John Hopkins put a study out saying, looks like about the same number died year to day this year
[1:22:24.400 --> 1:22:28.560]  2020 died last year. They go, oh, well, you don't know the next three, four months.
[1:22:28.560 --> 1:22:33.360]  You know, you don't try that. I mean, this is really deadly. Hide under your chair,
[1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:38.000]  life's over, never come back out. Only China fixed it. They're reopened. They're fine.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:43.440]  America's never reopening. Your small business never reopened. Walmart and Amazon, they're open.
[1:22:43.440 --> 1:22:58.720]  And now three days into the new year, 2021, the same death rate per 100,000 people
[1:22:58.720 --> 1:23:15.200]  is actually higher in the year 2020. It was 878 versus 870. But it's a razor's edge.
[1:23:15.760 --> 1:23:22.240]  So eight more people per 100,000 died this year, 2020 than last year.
[1:23:22.240 --> 1:23:32.800]  Wow. Wow. Isn't that amazing? And when you look at the suicide and the fentanyl and when you look
[1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:37.840]  at the infant mortality, type it in, infant mortality skyrocketing the Western world
[1:23:37.840 --> 1:23:41.600]  because they're carrying out operations to inoculate kids at birth. The vaccines are killing
[1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:47.200]  them. That's the main cause. I've had top doctors and scientists on. But here we are tonight
[1:23:47.200 --> 1:23:59.600]  showing you deaths in U.S. by the year. And look at that, year 2010. Now, 10 years ago,
[1:24:00.320 --> 1:24:07.920]  0.8. And the U.S. death rates are increasing. But years before COVID, three to four years
[1:24:07.920 --> 1:24:15.360]  before COVID raised its ugly head. That's powerful, isn't it? And then we've got a
[1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:19.440]  statistician actually hired that's going over all this. Think about the numbers.
[1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:25.680]  You've got double the suicides conservatively. It's actually more than that, almost triple.
[1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:31.520]  You've got massive increases in infant mortality for whatever reason. You've got
[1:24:33.520 --> 1:24:40.400]  the population growing in the United States. But this is per 100,000. And you add that in,
[1:24:40.400 --> 1:24:54.800]  the death rate is the same. See, we're 200, 300, 360, 370. Let me see. 100, 200, 300, 400.
[1:24:55.440 --> 1:25:03.360]  We're 370 million people. 335 million are citizens. Other 47 million are legal aliens.
[1:25:03.360 --> 1:25:08.880]  But the point is, that's a lot of people. But if they start going, oh, my God,
[1:25:08.880 --> 1:25:14.880]  3,000 died today, people hear that and they go, man, that's what died in the World Trade Center.
[1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:20.560]  Yeah, folks, you ever heard, don't fear the Reaper by the blue oyster cult? Don't fear the Reaper?
[1:25:21.200 --> 1:25:28.560]  And it lists, that was made back in the 70s. And it talks about 170,000 coming in today,
[1:25:28.560 --> 1:25:30.400]  170,000 coming out of day.
[1:25:30.400 --> 1:25:39.680]  That's hundreds of thousands coming in and out every day, baby. And they sit there and they
[1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:45.040]  stare at 3,000 and they go, oh, never leave your house again. And what does it do? It lowers the
[1:25:45.040 --> 1:25:49.840]  global economy. It starves the third world. It causes mass starvation. And the very UN
[1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:56.480]  behind all the lockdowns, the very UN pushing the global reset to depopulate says, oh, oh, my gosh,
[1:25:56.480 --> 1:26:01.840]  this is causing mass starvation. The virus is causing mass starvation. The virus didn't cause
[1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:05.760]  any of the starvation. The lockdown caused the starvation.
[1:26:07.280 --> 1:26:12.560]  But my wife was in Whole Foods, getting me short ribs. God, I love them two weeks ago.
[1:26:13.840 --> 1:26:16.560]  And our three-year-old daughter didn't have a mask on. This woman came over and she said,
[1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:21.280]  put your mask on. My wife pulled her mask down. She said, she's three years old.
[1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:29.200]  She's fine. It's exaggerated. The woman started hitting her card into her and saying, people
[1:26:29.200 --> 1:26:36.640]  are dying. The hospitals are full. My wife said, get your card off mine. And the woman wouldn't
[1:26:36.640 --> 1:26:42.080]  do it. So my wife went ahead and slammed her foot into the cart. And the woman ran off screaming
[1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:48.320]  in fear. But that's the leftist. They attack and they attack and they attack and they attack.
[1:26:48.320 --> 1:26:51.840]  I mean, she was screaming and yelling and cussing. My wife told me the whole story.
[1:26:51.840 --> 1:26:56.320]  There's a lot more to it. And like five minutes when my wife's getting some meat at the meat counter
[1:26:56.320 --> 1:27:00.240]  and this woman was going crazy on her, some middle-aged woman. And my wife was like,
[1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:05.200]  you're wearing your mask. You're safe, supposedly. Hey, the mask gives you bacterial pneumonia.
[1:27:05.200 --> 1:27:08.800]  Hey, it's never going to come off. And she didn't care. She wasn't caring.
[1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:12.240]  That was just pissed off. My wife was good looking and had a beautiful daughter.
[1:27:13.360 --> 1:27:17.440]  And this is their little excuse to do all this and have this power and say,
[1:27:17.440 --> 1:27:20.400]  oh, the hospitals are full. They're not full. They're empty.
[1:27:21.840 --> 1:27:27.200]  And to count everybody that dies of something else is this. It's incredible. But look at these
[1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:34.960]  numbers just coming out from the CDC, the site, cdc.gov. We've got a statistician paid right
[1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:48.160]  now getting the actual fine print breakdown of this. And yeah, I'll say it. The statistic is in 2020,
[1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:57.760]  it went from 870 deaths, 100,000 to 878. And when you add a doubling in the last three years to suicide,
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:04.400]  and infant mortality is going up, I guarantee you, I'm going to have a statistician have those numbers.
[1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:10.880]  I would expect that the general death rate probably went down. Hell, that should be much
[1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:15.040]  higher with a doubling of suicide and massive increase in infant mortality because the hospitals
[1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:18.400]  are all shut down and people are dying of cancer and dying of heart attacks as they can't get regular
[1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:26.560]  treatment. I'm surprised that number didn't go up. So there it is, eight people per 100,000.
[1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:36.320]  That's your big increase. Wow. I come up to the edge of a mountain. I come up to the mountain
[1:28:37.840 --> 1:28:45.760]  and I cut it down with the edge of my hand. Wow, that's powerful. We got two segments left
[1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:50.880]  on this live Sunday show that wasn't supposed to exist, that wasn't supposed to be here.
[1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:56.880]  But God's got other plans. Stay with us. We'll be back.
[1:29:20.880 --> 1:29:28.560]  Patriots of the world versus everybody else. I do solemnly swear that I will support and
[1:29:28.560 --> 1:29:35.680]  defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic,
[1:29:35.680 --> 1:29:41.920]  that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, that I take this obligation freely
[1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:48.240]  without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully
[1:29:48.240 --> 1:29:55.600]  discharge my duties as best as I can. So help me God. Infowars.com, Ben.video.
[1:30:18.560 --> 1:30:24.080]  show. I'm going to tell the world about living defense and what it did for me personally. Now,
[1:30:24.080 --> 1:30:30.560]  look, I'm 64 years old, going on 20 thanks to this Infowars store products. And by the way,
[1:30:30.560 --> 1:30:37.520]  I bought $800 worth the other night. So I'm doing what I can, brother. So what my contention is,
[1:30:37.520 --> 1:30:42.800]  why don't we start this new year off right with everybody getting a couple bottles of living
[1:30:42.800 --> 1:30:48.960]  defense? Now, you got to follow that up with the micro CF. I learned that. So it's like God working
[1:30:48.960 --> 1:30:54.720]  is so amazing. We didn't know we didn't screen your call. We had no idea. And I go to you a year
[1:30:54.720 --> 1:30:57.680]  later and you're here telling people about living defense, living defense, living defense.
[1:30:58.240 --> 1:31:03.040]  Inflation is here and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming, especially
[1:31:03.040 --> 1:31:08.240]  if the globalists are successful in killing the dollar. Tens of millions of Americans that were
[1:31:08.240 --> 1:31:14.400]  not awake are now beginning to store food. That's a good thing, but it's going to drive up prices.
[1:31:14.400 --> 1:31:20.400]  And we're already beginning to see record sales once again. We, the people understand it's up to
[1:31:20.400 --> 1:31:25.840]  us to protect ourselves. It's up to us to become self sufficient. The globalist are waging siege
[1:31:25.840 --> 1:31:31.040]  against us, trying to destroy our businesses, trying to bankrupt our families, our towns,
[1:31:31.040 --> 1:31:36.640]  our churches. That's why while we still can, you've got to get prepared and get ready. Take
[1:31:36.640 --> 1:31:43.920]  advantage of a huge final mega sale before prices go up and prepare with Alex.com and save up to
[1:31:43.920 --> 1:31:50.880]  $850 off the highest quality storeable foods out there. You've got until Friday, January 8th
[1:31:50.880 --> 1:31:56.560]  to get your orders in and prepare with Alex.com and lock in the lowest prices out there on high
[1:31:56.560 --> 1:32:01.760]  quality storeable food. The populist movement that elected President Trump four years ago
[1:32:01.760 --> 1:32:07.280]  re-elected him by an even bigger landslide, rejecting and repudiating and discrediting the
[1:32:07.280 --> 1:32:11.760]  globalist. That's why they had to overturn the chessboard. That's why they had to engage in
[1:32:11.760 --> 1:32:17.440]  naked election fraud in front of everyone. And as long as we never accept the fraudulent results,
[1:32:17.440 --> 1:32:22.000]  as long as we don't let them gaslight us into submission, as long as we point out this so foreign
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:26.960]  globalist takeover of our country and that all the depression and all of the collapse that's coming
[1:32:26.960 --> 1:32:32.400]  is because of the new world order, this will end up fully destroying them in the future. We don't
[1:32:32.400 --> 1:32:36.880]  submit. If we submit, they'll normalize the communism. They'll normalize putting us into a
[1:32:36.880 --> 1:32:41.840]  depression. They'll normalize breaking up our families, taking our guns. We can't let that
[1:32:41.840 --> 1:32:47.120]  happen. And Info Wars is more important than ever. So please, Paul Revere, I salute you for your past
[1:32:47.120 --> 1:32:53.200]  actions. Keep spreading Band-Aid video and infowars.com and come to the big DC marches on the 5th and
[1:32:53.200 --> 1:32:59.840]  6th of January. I'll see you there. God bless.
[1:32:59.840 --> 1:33:29.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:50.480]  The globalists call themselves a technocracy. They fancy themselves technocrats.
[1:33:51.120 --> 1:33:56.960]  They manipulate numbers. There are seven and a half billion people on this planet, probably more.
[1:33:56.960 --> 1:34:05.360]  Tens of millions come into the world every month. Tens of millions go out. But they know they show
[1:34:05.360 --> 1:34:11.680]  you someone dying of cancer or of heart disease that that's something scary to you. It should be
[1:34:11.680 --> 1:34:19.440]  scary. That's not something we should want to embrace, something we face. But now the numbers
[1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:26.480]  are coming in that 42.7 million babies were killed, many of them after they were born. It's the number
[1:34:26.480 --> 1:34:32.960]  one cause of death on the planet 25 times even what they claim died with the inflated numbers on
[1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:39.680]  COVID. So the system that's telling you Bill Gates, he wants to be popular like the earth, but now
[1:34:39.680 --> 1:34:45.360]  he wants you to take a vaccine because he cares so much about you and your family. That's all lie.
[1:34:47.040 --> 1:34:49.840]  That's why I've seen numbers and statistics and polls
[1:34:49.840 --> 1:35:00.080]  of 56 to 81% depending on the poll of medical workers refusing to take the vaccine. And now
[1:35:01.680 --> 1:35:06.800]  I had one of the crew members who has a family member that's a firefighter here in Texas
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:15.680]  in El Paso who was paid $800 to take the COVID vaccine.
[1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:21.520]  And I didn't just believe my crew member who I knew was being honest. We search
[1:35:21.520 --> 1:35:27.920]  engine it and found all over the country. It's the same number who decides this $800 to take it.
[1:35:29.120 --> 1:35:35.840]  The feds are talking about the Democrats are talking about $1800 to get poor women to take it.
[1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:42.320]  And when you go in and you're a man or a woman, it's now being confirmed. We played this last
[1:35:42.320 --> 1:35:51.120]  Friday that they have a special shot for men or for women. This is not a shot for COVID-19 boys and
[1:35:51.120 --> 1:35:58.160]  girls. Wolfgang Wudar, the head EU scientist on the advisory board, very respected, been a guest
[1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:09.440]  on the show. And his compatriot, the former chief scientist at Pfizer who quit none other cloud
[1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:15.040]  a few years ago just said, I'm not part of this. He signed his own disclosure. He's not saying what's
[1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:21.840]  going on. They filed a 30-something page report with thousands of pages of addendums. I spent
[1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:33.040]  days reading over 500 pages of it till my eyes were bleeding. And it says, this programs yourselves
[1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:43.200]  to attack a basic protein that is in the uterus. Specifically, the exact same protein is in the
[1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:53.520]  formation of the placenta. For those that don't know, every 28 days in estrus, the ovaries or a
[1:36:53.520 --> 1:37:00.480]  woman's testicles inside of her stomach, but this isn't like sperm is produced every day. This is
[1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:07.120]  from the time she's formed as a child in her mother. These eggs are created and they have a
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:16.400]  double set of DNA. Truly, women are the species. Men are an expression of it. They have the
[1:37:16.400 --> 1:37:21.360]  mitochondrial DNA and they have the regular DNA. And now they're even finding what they,
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:27.920]  I've been trying to read the genetics understand this, but it's incredible. Other sub-DNAs,
[1:37:27.920 --> 1:37:33.200]  like miniaturized DNAs that are in women. So women are like jam-packed with all the
[1:37:33.200 --> 1:37:41.760]  genetic code. Men are not. Men are an expression of women, like a cactus having a flower on it.
[1:37:42.800 --> 1:37:47.600]  We're there to defend the species. We're given all the will of the species. We're given the
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:57.680]  mathematical and computational powers to protect women while they create the next generation.
[1:37:58.240 --> 1:37:59.040]  This is a big deal.
[1:38:05.040 --> 1:38:12.240]  And when you look at this, it is a direct attack on the exact fast-growing protein.
[1:38:12.240 --> 1:38:18.640]  Oh, the virus is fast-growing. COVID-19. Oh, the cold virus. We can't get a cure because
[1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:24.480]  it's in us. Our bodies release it. Our bodies intake it. It's a communication system. They just
[1:38:24.480 --> 1:38:31.600]  know when we're sick, we have these in us, but it's bigger than that. And while you're ingesting
[1:38:31.600 --> 1:38:40.400]  this, they tell you you're sick. But it turns out that the coronavirus protein is the exact protein
[1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:49.920]  that when the sperm and the egg meet, either in the fallopian tubes or in the uterus,
[1:38:49.920 --> 1:38:54.400]  and that magic happens, I'd be a million sperm around that egg. None of them can pierce it.
[1:38:54.960 --> 1:39:01.920]  But that one sperm makes it through into that egg and creates that zygote and that new creature
[1:39:01.920 --> 1:39:06.240]  with all your genetic background, all her genetic background, are now merging in this moment of
[1:39:06.240 --> 1:39:11.920]  illusion, in this moment of incredible magic to build this new human, this new receptor for God,
[1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:24.400]  this new magic. It then falls down into the nest of fertilizer that the woman has produced
[1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:33.040]  in her uterus. And then as soon as it touches down in that warm soup, a tentacle grows out
[1:39:33.040 --> 1:39:41.360]  from the mother, recognizing it to touch her child and to take it into herself. And the connection
[1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:49.040]  happens. And it's one protein out of trillions of combinations of proteins. And it's the same in
[1:39:49.040 --> 1:39:53.120]  every woman. She could be black, she could be brown, she could be white, she could be yellow.
[1:39:53.120 --> 1:39:58.560]  She has the same protein. And it just so happens COVID-19 is the same protein. And now your body
[1:39:58.560 --> 1:40:04.240]  is going to attack that protein, show that when that little egg falls down, that little zygote
[1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:10.960]  falls down to find its nest and to have the mother's blood vessels grow into it and build a shield
[1:40:13.520 --> 1:40:18.560]  and build a sack. Within a sack, it fails.
[1:40:21.360 --> 1:40:26.240]  Every ancient drawing from the Aztecs, the Babylonians, the Chinese, the Druids,
[1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:32.960]  to the ancient Africans shows the devil eating children. The devil's main mission is to destroy
[1:40:32.960 --> 1:40:39.040]  our youth. And Bill Gates is Satan on earth. He's not the Antichrist, but the Bible says
[1:40:39.040 --> 1:40:47.120]  there are many Antichrists. He is a predecessor, a vanguard, a forerunner. And he goes on TV and
[1:40:47.120 --> 1:41:01.600]  declares his attack on you openly. So you remember that and you understand that and you know this is
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:09.440]  an attack upon the very life force of the planet and the planet that was given to us to build a
[1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:14.640]  bigger future in the universe and to launch our species into the stars and to other dimensions
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:22.320]  and to occupy what God has given us. And there is a Satanic move to block that and to
[1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:29.600]  not let that happen. And I swear eternal hostility towards that. I swear I will attack that operation
[1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:37.040]  110% because I love my ancestors and I love myself and I love my children and I love their
[1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:42.960]  children and I love you and we're on this together. Your ugliness is only a manifestation of Satan.
[1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:49.360]  Your fallen nature is a manifestation of that. You're beautiful. You're amazing. You're incredible.
[1:41:49.360 --> 1:41:56.160]  You're empowered. You're transcendent. You are pure energy and we will, we will escape this
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:02.880]  Satanic yoke and we will commune with God forever together. This is the time to do it.
[1:42:04.320 --> 1:42:09.360]  I don't have any Hail Marys for you. I don't have any rituals for you. I don't have any special
[1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:14.000]  stuff you do or you mail me some money and you get the answers universe. You got to get on your
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:18.880]  knees and open up to God and say, I don't want to be part of the new world order. I don't want to
[1:42:18.880 --> 1:42:23.520]  be a Satanist. I don't want to be part of the system. I want to be with you. I want to build
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:30.400]  things. I want to be good. I want to be loving. And if you do that, nothing can stop you. You will
[1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:38.000]  interface with God. Just like the sperm hitting that egg and something even bigger is going to
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:44.240]  happen because as above, so below. You say, oh, the Satanists say that. Yeah, the Satanists say
[1:42:44.240 --> 1:42:49.920]  the sun came up this morning. Doesn't mean they control it. The devil can read you scripture
[1:42:49.920 --> 1:42:55.120]  better than an angel. So don't let the devil tell you he built all this. He doesn't run any of it.
[1:42:57.680 --> 1:43:02.960]  The populist movement that elected President Trump four years ago reelected him by an even
[1:43:02.960 --> 1:43:08.640]  bigger landslide, rejecting and repudiating and discrediting the globalist. That's why they had
[1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:13.040]  to overturn the chessboard. That's why they had to engage in naked election fraud in front of
[1:43:13.040 --> 1:43:18.640]  everyone. And as long as we never accept the fraudulent results, as long as we don't let them gas
[1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:23.360]  light us into submission, as long as we point out this foreign globalist takeover of our country
[1:43:23.360 --> 1:43:28.400]  and that all the depression and all of the collapse that's coming is because of the new world order,
[1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:33.840]  this will end up fully destroying them in the future. We don't submit. If we submit, they'll
[1:43:33.840 --> 1:43:38.080]  normalize the communism. They'll normalize putting us into a depression. They'll normalize
[1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:43.200]  breaking up our families, taking our guns. We can't let that happen and info wars is more
[1:43:43.200 --> 1:43:48.160]  important than ever. So please, Paul Revere's I salute you for your past actions. Keep spreading
[1:43:48.160 --> 1:43:54.320]  band off video info wars.com and come to the big DC marches on the fifth and sixth of January.
[1:43:54.320 --> 1:44:02.000]  I'll see you there. God bless cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:07.680]  very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering
[1:44:07.680 --> 1:44:13.360]  from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars
[1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:19.920]  store.com. Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[1:44:19.920 --> 1:44:25.760]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a
[1:44:25.760 --> 1:44:32.160]  soothing reduction in inflammatory responses and joints and the digestive system. Recent studies
[1:44:32.160 --> 1:44:39.360]  have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the
[1:44:39.360 --> 1:44:46.400]  concentration and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical
[1:44:46.400 --> 1:44:53.040]  and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a
[1:44:53.040 --> 1:45:00.960]  friend, family member or yourself at info wars store.com. Three, two, one, here we go. It's back
[1:45:00.960 --> 1:45:05.040]  in stock. It's been sold out for over eight months. We couldn't get it because the lockdown pollen block
[1:45:05.040 --> 1:45:09.040]  is back in stock. Let me tell you, we'll book about it. But the power of quail egg concentrate,
[1:45:09.040 --> 1:45:12.320]  pollen block acts differently. The traditional line of histamines that was clinically studied
[1:45:12.320 --> 1:45:16.480]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping to clear sinus passages and eating respiratory
[1:45:16.480 --> 1:45:21.840]  function. It's amazing. Folks absolutely love it. And again, France has been shut down so we
[1:45:21.840 --> 1:45:28.240]  couldn't get it. Now a limited supply is back in stock 25% off at info wars store.com. Pollen block
[1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:33.520]  again is available in this one minute ad. I don't have time to tell you all about it. But believe
[1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:38.000]  me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally unlike some of the stuff that's
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:42.960]  up with the counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache. This is
[1:45:42.960 --> 1:45:47.760]  naturally occurring. It's the secret of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress and it's
[1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:53.200]  passed on somehow through their eggs to us. You chew up the pills, they taste great. It's available
[1:45:53.200 --> 1:46:00.320]  again info wars store.com pollen block info wars store.com wars store. Anybody listening to my
[1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:07.200]  voice and simply search engines in the term Davos group, technocracy or technocrats, you will get
[1:46:08.080 --> 1:46:15.600]  Clash mob and Sean Claude, Yunker and all the new order globalists like Gigi being saying that
[1:46:15.600 --> 1:46:21.520]  they no longer want elected leaders over governments, but they want businessman technocrats over it.
[1:46:21.520 --> 1:46:25.120]  And that's who Clash mob is. You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched
[1:46:25.680 --> 1:46:29.520]  the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor. You might want to find out
[1:46:29.520 --> 1:46:35.520]  who this super villain is. He believes because he's hidden playing you and you're not speaking
[1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:39.280]  out against it that he has a right to do it to you. You might want to find out who he works for.
[1:46:39.280 --> 1:46:44.080]  He works directly for Prince Charles. He developed since the 80s the plan for global
[1:46:44.080 --> 1:46:50.560]  sustainability. That means worldwide neo feudalism in his own words. So you might want to find out
[1:46:50.560 --> 1:46:55.200]  how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you for you take those shots. You might just want
[1:46:55.200 --> 1:47:11.120]  to find out who this villain is. All right. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:26.160 --> 1:47:32.480]  Okay, folks. We're in the middle of a scientific dictatorship, a genetic raping going on the
[1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:37.920]  mRNA vaccines, the world government. And these articles are pouring in. Here is a article out
[1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:45.360]  right now. Outrageous 32 year old Arizona woman arrested after beating coveted positive children
[1:47:45.360 --> 1:47:51.360]  for not wearing a mask. That's right. So now if you don't wear a mask and you beat your children,
[1:47:51.360 --> 1:47:55.760]  you go to jail. This is the abuse that's going on. It's absolutely outrageous. It's so evil.
[1:47:56.640 --> 1:48:02.480]  Now, let me talk about this. I like Joe Rogan. I've known Joe Rogan for 23 years. We're good
[1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:05.760]  friends. He lives here in Austin. He's back in town next week. We're gonna go get dinner,
[1:48:05.760 --> 1:48:12.480]  not named Robin. I'm just not put Joe down. But Joe got attacked for listening to Kim Trails,
[1:48:12.480 --> 1:48:17.920]  geo engineering 20 years ago. And a lot of people would say, Oh, no, normal ice crystals on a jet
[1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:23.680]  are are our Kim Trails. No, they're not normally jets at 20, 30,000 feet in cold weather.
[1:48:24.560 --> 1:48:33.040]  They create nucleization. They create nuclei. They make the water vapor combined off the edge
[1:48:33.040 --> 1:48:38.480]  of the wing and inform nuclei. And so that forms water vapor that forms ice crystals.
[1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:44.640]  But you don't get that at 20, 30,000 feet in the summer, you don't get it 10,000 feet in the summer.
[1:48:44.640 --> 1:48:54.480]  You don't get it 5,000 feet in the summer. And so back in 1992, an individual won a Nobel prize
[1:48:54.480 --> 1:49:00.480]  for science funded by Bill Gates for coming with a plan to block out the sun for global warming
[1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:04.000]  by spraying aluminum dioxide, barium salt in jet fuel out.
[1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:12.320]  And by 96, we began to say, Hey, suddenly used to watch ice trails when you're a kid,
[1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:16.560]  they disappear in a few minutes behind the jet. Now they're not disappearing. They're
[1:49:16.560 --> 1:49:21.760]  staying up there for hours. They're dissipating into big cloud banks. It's happening very,
[1:49:21.760 --> 1:49:31.280]  very low. Something is going on. Something is happening. Well, now it's in the Daily Mail.
[1:49:31.280 --> 1:49:37.920]  It's in the Associated Press. Zero hedge has an article. Here it is. Lockdown proponent Bill Gates
[1:49:37.920 --> 1:49:47.920]  quietly funding plan to dim the sun's rays. And it goes on to show articles in the blaze in the sun
[1:49:48.800 --> 1:49:55.760]  with announcements about Harvard to practice blocking the sun out by releasing aluminum dioxide
[1:49:55.760 --> 1:49:58.880]  and barium salts. So again,
[1:49:58.880 --> 1:50:09.200]  there's a Nobel Prize in 1992, starts happening by about 96. Under Trump, you notice that the big
[1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:16.080]  clouds that get sprayed and then expand and never dissipate had gone away. Well, they're going to
[1:50:16.080 --> 1:50:21.840]  be back. The Department of Energy has declassified a $5 million program, adding chemicals to jet
[1:50:21.840 --> 1:50:26.240]  fuel. The jet companies don't ask. It's the jet suppliers, three main suppliers nationwide.
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:32.080]  And then the jet engines, we have the patents, dissipate the barium salts,
[1:50:32.080 --> 1:50:39.600]  the aluminum oxides that then form the nuclei for water vapor to start sticking together
[1:50:39.600 --> 1:50:45.920]  and then blocking out the sun. And then it's got its own problem, poisoning the soil
[1:50:45.920 --> 1:50:51.360]  and aluminum levels going up. But what's frustrating is Joe Rogan, it's told, oh, no,
[1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:58.080]  crazies think every trail in the sky is a chem trail. But here is the former CIA director five years
[1:50:58.080 --> 1:51:04.080]  ago when he was still the CIA director, Brennan bragging about chem trails. Then I'll show you
[1:51:04.080 --> 1:51:10.240]  what Bill Gates just announced. Here it is. Another example is the array of technologies,
[1:51:10.240 --> 1:51:15.360]  often referred to collectively as geoengineering, that potentially could help reverse the warming
[1:51:15.360 --> 1:51:20.880]  effects of global climate change. One that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric
[1:51:20.880 --> 1:51:27.040]  aerosol injection or SAI, a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help
[1:51:27.040 --> 1:51:34.000]  reflect the sun's heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do. An SAI program could limit
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:39.200]  global temperature increases, reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures and providing
[1:51:39.200 --> 1:51:45.440]  the world economy additional time to transition from fossil fuels. This process is also relatively
[1:51:45.440 --> 1:51:50.720]  inexpensive. The National Research Council estimates that a fully deployed SAI program
[1:51:50.720 --> 1:51:57.760]  would cost about $10 billion yearly. As promising as it may be, moving forward on SAI would also
[1:51:57.760 --> 1:52:01.760]  raise a number of challenges for our government and for the international community. Okay,
[1:52:01.760 --> 1:52:08.480]  that's enough. So SAI has been going on since the mid 90s. They want a Nobel Prize for it.
[1:52:08.480 --> 1:52:13.520]  You got the former CIA director when he was CIA director telling you, and now Bill Gates is in
[1:52:13.520 --> 1:52:22.320]  the news saying he wants to do this to you to stop the sun because the sun is bad and the
[1:52:22.320 --> 1:52:27.840]  earth is too hot. This is him playing God. He's going to put in your body the mRNA vaccine.
[1:52:27.840 --> 1:52:31.200]  He's going to tell you that we're never going to reopen. He's going to tell you he's going to block
[1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:38.320]  the sun out. This is a mad scientist playing God. This isn't Austin Powers and Dr. Evil and
[1:52:38.320 --> 1:52:45.360]  many me and it's a joke. This is the real world. And he released the
[1:52:45.600 --> 1:52:51.280]  diseased mosquitoes in Latin America 10 years ago that have now mutated and are spreading disease.
[1:52:52.400 --> 1:52:57.280]  And he's gotten away with committing all these psychopathic crimes. And now he wants to commit
[1:52:57.280 --> 1:53:04.320]  even bigger crimes. I just showed you the former CIA director when he was the director at the CFR
[1:53:04.320 --> 1:53:11.760]  on C-SPAN admitting geoengineering with chemtrails. And I talked to pilots, everybody, they say it's
[1:53:11.760 --> 1:53:19.280]  going on. But when we address it, the media says it doesn't exist. And they ban us off YouTube,
[1:53:19.280 --> 1:53:23.200]  they ban us off Facebook, they ban us off Twitter. That's why at theresistance.video,
[1:53:24.160 --> 1:53:28.880]  you will find the link to Band-Aid video that's now banned. You can't promote Band-Aid video on
[1:53:28.880 --> 1:53:34.640]  Facebook or Twitter. You can ban Band-Aid video, but you can't ban the resistance.video or the
[1:53:34.640 --> 1:53:40.000]  next URL we make. That's how people find the forbidden information. That's the key hole
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:45.600]  into the bigger universe is the resistance.video. You know what's going on, but don't you want to
[1:53:45.600 --> 1:53:51.440]  share it with others? Don't you want to counter these lies? So lockdown proponent Bill Gates
[1:53:51.440 --> 1:53:59.280]  quietly funding plan to dim the sun's rays, zero hedge. And it's in AP, it's in Reuters,
[1:53:59.280 --> 1:54:05.200]  it's in the sun, it's all there. Oh, yeah, he's got airplanes up there doing this. Oh,
[1:54:05.920 --> 1:54:12.560]  he just had the idea today. And since 1992, they decided to go operational with it.
[1:54:12.560 --> 1:54:24.720]  Think about that. But it's okay because Harvard's involved. See, that's all I'm wanting you to
[1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:31.360]  understand is Bill Gates is obsessed with force inoculations. He's then obsessed with gut health,
[1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:35.760]  that's causing all the autism triggered by the vaccinations. He's obsessed with geoengineering,
[1:54:35.760 --> 1:54:39.840]  blocking out the sun. He wants to make you take whatever he wants, whenever he wants,
[1:54:39.840 --> 1:54:46.960]  with liability protection for what he puts in you. You couldn't make this up in a Hollywood movie.
[1:54:48.640 --> 1:54:54.080]  But because it's real, the average person has suspended disbelief. And they just can't believe
[1:54:54.080 --> 1:55:00.320]  this is happening to them. They have a normalcy bias, and they go into massive Stockholm syndrome.
[1:55:00.960 --> 1:55:06.240]  All right, Sunday Live's a new show that Owen Shroyer, Tom Pappert, Harrison Smith and others
[1:55:06.240 --> 1:55:12.480]  co-host that comes up. 6 to 8 p.m. We're really proud of the show. I hope you tune in to it.
