[00:00.000 --> 00:07.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live, it's Friday the 15th of April 2016.
[00:07.560 --> 00:12.420]  We've got a very important transmission lined up at first, a key report from John Bowne.
[00:12.420 --> 00:18.580]  The panicked elite are buying up underground bunkers and or fleeing to parts unknown.
[00:18.580 --> 00:23.220]  As all indications point towards a collapse that will in the words of economist Peter
[00:23.220 --> 00:28.120]  Schiff be the earthquake that follows the 2008 tremor.
[00:28.120 --> 00:34.840]  The Chicago Tribune reported that about 3,000 individuals with net assets of $1 million or
[00:34.840 --> 00:40.920]  more left Chicago in the last year alone due to the exploding climate of unrest growing
[00:40.920 --> 00:42.720]  in the Union stockyards.
[00:42.720 --> 00:44.760]  The writing is on the wall.
[00:44.760 --> 00:49.600]  President Obama in concert with his puppet master George Soros have been turning up the
[00:49.600 --> 00:55.160]  heat on deteriorating conditions resulting from the United States and the EU's strategic
[00:55.160 --> 00:58.800]  collapse of the global economy for the last seven years.
[00:58.800 --> 01:03.000]  So if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant they can, it's just that it will bankrupt
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.840]  them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's
[01:08.840 --> 01:09.840]  being emitted.
[01:09.840 --> 01:14.960]  Before Obama ever came around, coal was doing good, Obama killed it.
[01:14.960 --> 01:18.560]  We have citizens digging through the trash just to eat.
[01:18.560 --> 01:23.400]  I wish he'd just step off the face of the earth, wouldn't hurt my feelings none.
[01:23.400 --> 01:29.240]  It's actually hurt coal is not any EPA rules as much as it is really cheap natural gas
[01:29.240 --> 01:31.720]  that has come from fracking.
[01:31.720 --> 01:38.920]  They're fracking with such corrupt practices across the United States that the well water
[01:38.920 --> 01:46.640]  is catching on fire.
[01:46.640 --> 01:52.280]  Soros signals Argentina's shale is biggest place to be, Soros doubled his stake and stayed
[01:52.280 --> 01:57.240]  owned oil company in Argentina while for the last seven years spending tens of millions
[01:57.240 --> 02:04.000]  of dollars a lobby to shut down shale production in the U.S. by Wildcat small companies and
[02:04.000 --> 02:10.680]  I'm not saying shale fracking is good overall, I'm not saying there aren't problems but most
[02:10.680 --> 02:16.080]  of it's financed by Soros and Saudi Arabia who don't want us to have our own oil.
[02:16.080 --> 02:20.640]  So a coal plant in Mexico that's totally dirty is okay but a coal plant in Texas that's
[02:20.640 --> 02:22.200]  claimed is not okay.
[02:22.200 --> 02:29.960]  And most of these crackers and oil sands people can't break even unless oil is over $80 or
[02:29.960 --> 02:30.960]  at least over $55.
[02:30.960 --> 02:36.800]  I think it's 10 to 20 in the next several years so what they're doing is they're pumping
[02:36.800 --> 02:42.400]  their existing wells to the max to create cash flow because their wells are it's not
[02:42.400 --> 02:46.680]  expensive to pump, it's expensive to find the darn things and drill and they were only
[02:46.680 --> 02:50.960]  able to do that with the chief's junk bonds in history because of quantitative easing
[02:50.960 --> 02:56.360]  and artificial stimulus and oil price so that's the next thing to hit the United States.
[02:56.360 --> 03:01.120]  The Wall Street Journal reports that the largest coal company in the United States has filed
[03:01.120 --> 03:06.240]  for bankruptcy, an event that will result in energy costs that will sharply rise on
[03:06.240 --> 03:10.560]  the American middle class like they have on the common people of Germany.
[03:10.560 --> 03:15.280]  Germany's energy policies have gradually doubled the average industrial cost per kilowatt
[03:15.280 --> 03:20.840]  hour as clean and renewable energy can't carry the load, literally.
[03:20.840 --> 03:25.600]  Last week Obama began pushing for housing lenders to offer home loans to people with
[03:25.600 --> 03:26.880]  bad credit.
[03:26.880 --> 03:33.960]  What better way to push the economy over the edge than to repeat the same 2008 nightmare?
[03:33.960 --> 03:38.840]  We're using data on housing and neighborhood conditions to help cities identify the areas
[03:38.840 --> 03:40.280]  that need the most help.
[03:40.280 --> 03:46.320]  By 2014 investors had already begun to notice another government-fed subprime housing bubble
[03:46.320 --> 03:48.040]  on the horizon.
[03:48.040 --> 03:53.640]  Investors business daily wrote in January of 2014, what stoked housing inflation was
[03:53.640 --> 03:59.800]  federal housing policies designed to boost home ownership among low income and minority
[03:59.800 --> 04:00.920]  borrowers.
[04:00.920 --> 04:08.600]  Between 2011 and the third quarter of 2013, housing prices rose nearly 6%, triple the
[04:08.600 --> 04:10.560]  increase in rental costs.
[04:10.560 --> 04:15.160]  Both this bubble and the last one were caused by the government's housing policies, low
[04:15.160 --> 04:23.920]  down payments, a mere 5% at Fannie and Freddie and just 3.5% at the FHA are fueling the bubble.
[04:23.920 --> 04:30.560]  But new qualified mortgage rules don't require a minimum down payment for borrowers in 2014.
[04:30.560 --> 04:35.560]  The country has been misled about financial reform.
[04:35.560 --> 04:41.040]  Infowars has called for Obama's impeachment on numerous occasions to no avail.
[04:41.040 --> 04:46.920]  His supposed lame duck presidency heading into the end of his term has been tremendously
[04:46.920 --> 04:49.000]  underestimated.
[04:49.000 --> 04:54.120]  Americans are nothing less than under a full new world order attack aided and abetted by
[04:54.120 --> 04:58.480]  the executive branch of the United States of America.
[04:58.480 --> 05:05.640]  A seismologist warns that catastrophic mega earthquakes are on their way after five major
[05:05.640 --> 05:09.200]  earthquakes took place in the last 48 hours.
[05:09.200 --> 05:13.240]  Seismologist Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado has made headlines all over the
[05:13.240 --> 05:17.960]  world by warning that current conditions might trigger at least four earthquakes greater
[05:17.960 --> 05:20.040]  than 8.0 in magnitude.
[05:20.040 --> 05:23.720]  If his projections are accurate, our planet could be on the precipice of a wave of natural
[05:23.720 --> 05:27.000]  disasters unlike anything that any of us have witnessed before.
[05:27.000 --> 05:33.040]  A single magnitude 8.0 earthquake in a populated area would be a disaster of historic proportions.
[05:33.040 --> 05:36.200]  But four of them, that would be a complete and utter nightmare.
[05:36.200 --> 05:41.560]  And according to Volcano Discovery, 38 volcanoes around the globe are erupting right now.
[05:41.560 --> 05:43.960]  Michael Snyder asks, why is this happening?
[05:43.960 --> 05:47.840]  Why is the crust of the earth shaking so violently all of a sudden?
[05:47.840 --> 05:52.080]  In Matthew 24, Jesus warned us that there would be earthquakes in diverse places just
[05:52.080 --> 05:53.440]  prior to his return.
[05:53.440 --> 05:57.320]  Are we truly in the times that the Bible refers to as the last days?

[05:59.600 --> 06:03.600]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[06:08.720 --> 06:12.000]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[07:08.960 --> 07:14.000]  a highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used
[07:14.000 --> 07:19.920]  by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health, sourced from top leading manufacturers
[07:19.920 --> 07:25.600]  to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients extracted directly from the wild
[07:25.600 --> 07:30.800]  herb and sealed in easy to use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning
[07:30.800 --> 07:32.800]  of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[07:32.800 --> 07:37.480]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and
[07:37.480 --> 07:42.240]  enhance overall health, wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts
[07:42.240 --> 07:45.760]  agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[07:45.760 --> 07:51.040]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano,
[07:51.040 --> 07:53.640]  now available at infowarslife.com.
[07:53.640 --> 07:56.640]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[07:56.640 --> 07:57.640]  We've got it.
[07:57.640 --> 08:07.840]  Thank you for your specialist coming to you.
[08:07.840 --> 08:09.840]  Waging war on corruption.
[08:09.840 --> 08:24.320]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[08:24.320 --> 08:30.240]  I woke up this morning at about 6.30 a.m. and it hit me.
[08:30.240 --> 08:37.160]  One of the biggest problems we face is that we're losing boundaries, we're losing impulse
[08:37.160 --> 08:45.960]  control and when I talk about impulse control, I mean within the governing and elite class.
[08:45.960 --> 08:50.960]  I was just thinking about how they have this race going in their own words to merge with
[08:50.960 --> 08:57.000]  machines and become gods and they've already decided in all the dominant literature that
[08:57.000 --> 09:03.400]  humans are obsolete and an ugly bad thing and that we're going to phase out the human
[09:03.400 --> 09:05.400]  race as it's known.
[09:05.400 --> 09:15.200]  That is the collective cosmology or belief system of the ruling establishment.
[09:15.200 --> 09:22.160]  They've taken over the world mainly through crony capitalism and combines and now they're
[09:22.160 --> 09:27.680]  looking at everyone else eating up their resources that they believe belong to them and they're
[09:27.680 --> 09:33.560]  setting up a system to phase out humanity as we know it.
[09:33.560 --> 09:37.640]  Now obviously I have stacks of news here to cover today but why do I so often open with
[09:37.640 --> 09:38.920]  that general theme?
[09:38.920 --> 09:40.000]  Because that is what's happening.
[09:40.000 --> 09:47.680]  We're on a space rock that's not that big, seven and a half billion of us, hurtling
[09:47.680 --> 09:59.040]  around a sun at 30 something thousand miles an hour and we look at these elites and these
[09:59.040 --> 10:05.480]  leaders who are just like leaders of old, they just have more high-tech weapons and
[10:05.480 --> 10:06.480]  more propaganda.
[10:06.480 --> 10:13.440]  They have the same hubris, the same megalomania, the same mental illness and I see the amount
[10:13.440 --> 10:21.320]  of delusion and mental illness increasing in the general public and it's admitted that
[10:21.320 --> 10:28.720]  mental illness is skyrocketing and delusional behavior but I see it all around me.
[10:28.720 --> 10:36.840]  I've probably known personally 12 or 13 people, I was thinking about it this morning, in just
[10:36.840 --> 10:46.600]  the last six years that were normal and behaving normally who went completely insane.
[10:46.600 --> 10:49.000]  Is it the water?
[10:49.000 --> 10:50.000]  Is it the air?
[10:50.000 --> 10:51.480]  Is it the unnatural culture?
[10:51.480 --> 10:56.400]  We've heard about cabin fever and the cold winter when you're locked up at the North
[10:56.400 --> 11:01.280]  Pole for a month and most people start going crazy, heard about cabin fever on ships, heard
[11:01.280 --> 11:05.320]  about space fever when people are out in space for a month or so they start going nuts, even
[11:05.320 --> 11:07.680]  the strongest people.
[11:07.680 --> 11:12.840]  We're living in such an unnatural world and I'm not bashing technology, I'm bashing some
[11:12.840 --> 11:17.360]  of the bad side effects of it and I've used this analogy many times, it's like if you're
[11:17.360 --> 11:23.200]  on a Mars mission, a year and a half to get to Mars with the current technology, if they
[11:23.200 --> 11:31.040]  try to go to Mars at the right time in a cycle when the planet is closer to us, the fourth
[11:31.040 --> 11:38.680]  rock, that even the most healthy astronaut who could run two marathons back to back on
[11:38.680 --> 11:43.800]  Earth, when they get to Mars, will have to spend a few months basically being able to
[11:43.800 --> 11:52.600]  work out on the surface, slowly be able to jog or lift up a 20 pound box.
[11:52.600 --> 11:57.880]  Even cosmonauts that have been in space for a year have trouble even getting up out of
[11:57.880 --> 12:00.320]  their seats.
[12:00.320 --> 12:05.240]  Russia last time I checked has the longest time spent in space, I think one time I spent
[12:05.240 --> 12:09.440]  almost two years up there and it showed when the capsule came down they couldn't even get
[12:09.440 --> 12:17.520]  up, they had trouble breathing, had to give them oxygen, their lungs couldn't even operate.
[12:17.520 --> 12:22.160]  And that's what it is with screen time and calculators and all these machines and buzzing
[12:22.160 --> 12:29.960]  this and buzzing that and smart phones, we're being encased in a control grid that dumbs
[12:29.960 --> 12:36.480]  us down, makes us unhealthy, makes us unhappy.
[12:36.480 --> 12:40.720]  People say hey hypocrite you're sitting at the center of a high tech news studio wired
[12:40.720 --> 12:45.160]  in like maybe only one tenth of one percent of people are.
[12:45.160 --> 12:49.560]  I mean this is like per square foot got more computers and wires and antennas than the
[12:49.560 --> 12:59.960]  Pentagon, I get it, I know, that's my point, how do you live in this and contain your humanity
[12:59.960 --> 13:00.960]  and keep it.
[13:00.960 --> 13:06.680]  And I've got a stack of news along that line today that we're going to be getting to the
[13:06.680 --> 13:17.480]  way they're selling it, DNA analysis could help improve your workout study finds, Reuters.
[13:17.480 --> 13:23.560]  My dad wanted me to talk about this like a month ago and I never did.
[13:23.560 --> 13:26.120]  But I had him run back to my office and get it.
[13:26.120 --> 13:28.240]  Thank you Niko.
[13:28.240 --> 13:31.720]  He went because he decided to go ahead and keep his dental license and boy that came
[13:31.720 --> 13:36.280]  in handy when my son, my dad's an endodontist and oral surgeon, a lot of other stuff, my
[13:36.280 --> 13:41.960]  son jumping on the trampoline with some friends house knocked his two front teeth out.
[13:41.960 --> 13:46.240]  And of course we'd gone to the emergency room and they would have just taken them, you know,
[13:46.240 --> 13:50.440]  they were like back at a 45 degree angle, basically out hanging by meat, but my dad
[13:50.440 --> 13:54.000]  got them back in and looks like I've been able to keep them, thank God.
[13:54.000 --> 14:04.200]  But long story short, he was going back to get his continuing education just to keep
[14:04.200 --> 14:11.200]  his license just so he can work on the family a few months ago because his license was coming
[14:11.200 --> 14:12.200]  up.
[14:12.200 --> 14:18.200]  He retired via Obamacare because it's so immoral, he refuses to be part of it, he was also managing
[14:18.200 --> 14:22.560]  several hundred medical clinics and he got out of it even though he's very successful
[14:22.560 --> 14:26.440]  because again, it's just so evil.
[14:26.440 --> 14:31.920]  And that was the plan, you know, get all the good medical people out and it's working well.
[14:31.920 --> 14:35.920]  Now he's bringing the foreign doctors and the rest of it and lower the standards.
[14:35.920 --> 14:40.160]  I thought the foreign doctors are bad either, it's just they come from India or Eastern
[14:40.160 --> 14:44.040]  Europe, they're used to ration care, they're used to following orders, they're used to
[14:44.040 --> 14:52.880]  not having a Hippocratic health, but I digress, they're used to socialism and he was in several
[14:52.880 --> 14:58.600]  days of continuing education and most of it is about the DEA and prescriptions and this
[14:58.600 --> 15:03.280]  rule and that rule and how to fill this chart out and all that garbage.
[15:03.280 --> 15:08.680]  And he said like half a day was on how everyone's going to have DNA chips starting in the next
[15:08.680 --> 15:16.520]  year or two and how you won't give anyone a prescription unless they have a DNA chip
[15:16.520 --> 15:22.360]  and then how in the next rollout, the DNA chip will communicate with chips in all of
[15:22.360 --> 15:28.000]  the pills and that they're going to then basically have smart meters all over the place that
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.480]  are reading your bodies as you just walk down the street to see what you're on and then
[15:32.480 --> 15:35.080]  call the police on you.
[15:35.080 --> 15:38.800]  And by the way, I mean I told people about license plate reading cameras 20 years ago
[15:38.800 --> 15:42.840]  and they didn't believe it, now you know they're everywhere, it's the same thing.
[15:42.840 --> 15:51.840]  Here it is in business, insider, I have another one on the one in telegraph, smart mattress
[15:51.840 --> 15:54.360]  lets you know if your partner is cheating.
[15:54.360 --> 16:00.560]  See chips are so cheap now that you pay $5 extra, $10 extra and the smart mattress tells
[16:00.560 --> 16:03.720]  you everything you're on, what you've been doing and if you've had sex with somebody
[16:03.720 --> 16:10.120]  else, see they're enticing us into the spy grid just like I read 15, 16 years ago in
[16:10.120 --> 16:16.080]  AP how they were coming out with the new light bulbs under mandate and thank goodness they
[16:16.080 --> 16:22.800]  just so happened to work, no they were designed that way, this is unity of agenda, this is
[16:22.800 --> 16:29.600]  standardized global rollout that data over power lines would then send data through
[16:29.600 --> 16:35.320]  your power lines into your house and then end it, smart meters and smart interfaces
[16:35.320 --> 16:41.120]  and smart bulbs and the bulbs would then communicate with different things in your house and it
[16:41.120 --> 16:45.880]  also had a fringe benefit just accidentally, just like it accidentally you know just hooks
[16:45.880 --> 16:53.680]  into the grid and data, it accidentally can calm you during crises and it will know when
[16:53.680 --> 16:59.000]  just to, just like the smart meters we told you 16, 17 years ago would tax you during
[16:59.000 --> 17:06.120]  key times and would control your thermostat, it's now being done in four states, li-fi
[17:06.120 --> 17:12.840]  all of it and this is what's so frustrating, I'm only scratching the surface and this is
[17:12.840 --> 17:18.320]  all being rolled out like the elite or an alien force or something, imagine a science
[17:18.320 --> 17:21.760]  fiction movie where they look like humans but they have all this high tech and they're
[17:21.760 --> 17:26.160]  making it where everything from the TVs to the toasters to your mattress to your car
[17:26.160 --> 17:32.280]  is remote controlled by them, tracks you and taxes you to siphon off all your funds to
[17:32.280 --> 17:38.160]  their corporate reservations where they're actually building a breakaway civilization,
[17:38.160 --> 17:43.880]  that'd be a neat science fiction movie wouldn't it but that's what they're doing and they're
[17:43.880 --> 17:51.800]  not aliens, they're crazy people who are inspired if you go to Bohemian Grove, Skull and Mones
[17:51.800 --> 17:59.680]  in Places by Lucifer, now who's Lucifer, he's fallen to earth, he doesn't like us,
[17:59.680 --> 18:04.400]  he wants to override creation and set himself up as God, that's what the Bible says, it's
[18:04.400 --> 18:19.000]  happening, a fallen entity who fell to this planet and is doing this to us, I mean there's
[18:19.000 --> 18:25.440]  the answer, it's all real, it's really happening and whether that Lucifer is real or not the
[18:25.440 --> 18:31.240]  elite are doing it, they're building it, so I'm going to talk about this later in the
[18:31.240 --> 18:34.640]  broadcast, we've got a bunch of guests coming up as well but I want to do a whole report
[18:34.640 --> 18:41.000]  too on DNA chips and again the chip isn't in you, they take your blood once, it's then
[18:41.000 --> 18:46.440]  in a chip database and then they can take your blood and prick you again whenever they
[18:46.440 --> 18:49.740]  want, it's just quick and easy, no big deal and they've got a bunch of different ones
[18:49.740 --> 18:57.600]  coming out but MIT News, major step in implantable drug delivery device, why pharma wants to
[18:57.600 --> 19:06.480]  put sensors in the blockbuster drug, microchip implants medication on command, scientific
[19:06.480 --> 19:12.440]  and then this isn't the full one, here it is, lab on a chip technology for near patient
[19:12.440 --> 19:18.640]  diagnosis, this is Austin Publishing, this is what they were teaching them, bio electronic
[19:18.640 --> 19:22.960]  DNA chips for the clinical laboratory and they're telling them when he went for his
[19:22.960 --> 19:29.760]  continuing education as an endodontist, as an oral surgeon, they told them oh yeah this
[19:29.760 --> 19:34.040]  is what everybody's going to have, just like they told my cousin who's just got out of
[19:34.040 --> 19:38.240]  the army at 35 years, 10 years ago that troops were going to start getting chips and they
[19:38.240 --> 19:42.480]  did start getting them, special forces and people and then it's classified so they can't
[19:42.480 --> 19:46.640]  tell you, I mean the chipping's already going on and then it was in MIT magazine a few months
[19:46.640 --> 19:51.560]  ago that troops are getting brain chips and it shows them putting brain chips in them,
[19:51.560 --> 19:56.760]  now of course they're opting into the programs now, soon it'll be mandatory, we got the big
[19:56.760 --> 20:24.760]  trump news straight ahead, stay with us.

[23:03.480 --> 23:08.240]  It's true, some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[23:08.240 --> 23:10.720]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[23:10.720 --> 23:15.400]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[24:29.120 --> 24:32.960]  can't make us run.
[24:32.960 --> 24:35.840]  Establishment wants domesticated populations and that's what they're doing with this high
[24:35.840 --> 24:39.960]  tech, overwrite.
[24:39.960 --> 24:51.160]  Technology is not being brought into empowers, but to hamstring us, to enslave us.
[24:51.160 --> 24:58.160]  I can fly a field all day long, I can catch catfish from dust till dawn.
[24:58.160 --> 25:06.000]  We've got a lot of big guests coming up today.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.280]  Larry Nichols is popping in with big news, Colonel Rob Manus, who's running for the US
[25:10.280 --> 25:11.280]  Senate.
[25:11.280 --> 25:18.920]  Really interesting fellows going to pop in, hitter Schiff, Rob Dew and the crew from Denver.
[25:18.920 --> 25:21.280]  They were in New York yesterday.
[25:21.280 --> 25:26.400]  Here's the best part, crank it up, who we're waiting for, because you can't starve us out.
[25:26.400 --> 25:30.920]  Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run.
[25:30.920 --> 25:33.480]  Those wisdom old boys raised, don't shot us.
[25:33.480 --> 25:35.240]  Oh, they've got shotguns?
[25:35.240 --> 25:36.240]  They say great.
[25:36.240 --> 25:37.240]  They say amen.
[25:37.240 --> 25:40.440]  And if you're not into that, well you know what?
[25:40.440 --> 25:42.960]  Don't give a damn.
[25:42.960 --> 25:45.080]  That's what it comes down to, those bitter clingers.
[25:45.080 --> 25:54.640]  We're going to have the crew on pre-demonstration there in Denver against the theft of the
[25:54.640 --> 25:59.080]  election by the Republican and Democratic establishment.
[25:59.080 --> 26:04.560]  It's at the RNC, talked to Roger Stone yesterday, he begged the listeners, he said, please tell
[26:04.560 --> 26:10.680]  your listeners, get involved, take action, get in there, be part of this.
[26:10.680 --> 26:18.320]  And the good news is, the media engaged in a giant sickening scythe, but they gauged
[26:18.320 --> 26:23.680]  the public and now it all collapsed starting yesterday.
[26:23.680 --> 26:31.480]  I monitor the news, obviously as my crew does and many of you do, and I see in the controlled
[26:31.480 --> 26:40.200]  media their attempts in everything from the Washington Post to USA Today to MSNBC to CNN
[26:40.200 --> 26:49.360]  Fox to normalize, of course no one ever votes in primaries and the party appoints the nominee.
[26:49.360 --> 26:50.360]  That's never happened before.
[26:50.360 --> 26:54.160]  If that starts happening, then it's a dictatorship of an oligarchy.
[26:54.160 --> 26:58.840]  It's like the Chinese system, the Central Committee and then the Politburo.
[26:58.840 --> 27:04.080]  Yes, you have people that represent the voters from the precinct who are pledged and if it's
[27:04.080 --> 27:10.400]  neck and neck, then historically there can be some jockeying.
[27:10.400 --> 27:14.720]  I mean Reagan won by a handy amount in the delegates, but they still try to take it from
[27:14.720 --> 27:15.720]  him.
[27:15.720 --> 27:17.520]  So that was the first time this got floated around.
[27:17.520 --> 27:24.040]  They put it on the books four years before in 1976, but they tried it in 1980 and the
[27:24.040 --> 27:30.520]  threat was enough to get Reagan to put George Herbert Walker Bush in the VP slot and then
[27:30.520 --> 27:31.520]  Reagan got shot.
[27:31.520 --> 27:35.560]  The rest is history, we've had three rounds of Bushes and now they want a fourth one with
[27:35.560 --> 27:36.560]  Ted Cruz.
[27:36.560 --> 27:39.840]  That's with heavy heart out to come out against Ted Cruz.
[27:39.840 --> 27:43.000]  I ignore all the Goldman Sachs stuff and the Bush connections hoping that that's just
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.400]  how he came up and he was for real.
[27:44.400 --> 27:45.920]  No, he's a total operative.
[27:45.920 --> 27:51.040]  He's uncloked in his arrogance and I'm physically sick over it.
[27:51.040 --> 27:53.840]  I physically am sick of betrayal.
[27:53.840 --> 27:55.320]  I want to believe in this country.
[27:55.320 --> 27:57.080]  I want things to get better.
[27:57.080 --> 27:58.600]  I want to believe in the government.
[27:58.600 --> 27:59.760]  I want to believe in the people.
[27:59.760 --> 28:02.360]  I'm tired of it.
[28:02.360 --> 28:07.200]  Where are the honorable people?
[28:07.200 --> 28:13.600]  And the good news is starting about yesterday, I saw it shift and even mainstream media went
[28:13.600 --> 28:17.760]  and even Fox and CNN others were like, as I monitor it, we're like, yeah, I mean, people
[28:17.760 --> 28:19.240]  do want the popular vote to be counted.
[28:19.240 --> 28:20.320]  We better do it.
[28:20.320 --> 28:25.080]  You better not try that because they realize no one was buying their Psyop that everyone
[28:25.080 --> 28:30.280]  once opened, you know, borders, everybody wants forced vaccines, everybody wants to
[28:30.280 --> 28:33.520]  be spied on, everybody wants to not have a vote.
[28:33.520 --> 28:37.120]  Of course you never vote like, well, why do we have primaries?
[28:37.120 --> 28:38.200]  Why do we vote before?
[28:38.200 --> 28:40.640]  Why'd you say we get the government we vote for?
[28:40.640 --> 28:44.960]  If I don't get to vote, then I don't get to pay taxes or follow your laws.
[28:44.960 --> 28:48.560]  You don't just sit up there over me.
[28:48.560 --> 28:54.120]  And so a stack of articles today in my stack, I mean, there's like 15 articles I came across
[28:54.120 --> 28:58.800]  not even looking US news and world reports, Sarah Palin says voters should decide GOP
[28:58.800 --> 28:59.800]  nomination.
[28:59.800 --> 29:00.800]  Wow.
[29:00.800 --> 29:01.800]  That's man.
[29:01.800 --> 29:03.640]  What a what a weirdo voters.
[29:03.640 --> 29:07.920]  What what are those CBS news?
[29:07.920 --> 29:13.240]  Why the GOP can't take the nomination from Donald Trump?
[29:13.240 --> 29:17.360]  And it goes on and on cold greeting for Cruz at GOP Gala.
[29:17.360 --> 29:23.680]  He's going down to the polls, New Yorkers ignore Ted Cruz at GOP Gala.
[29:23.680 --> 29:28.280]  They've dropped the charges against Trump's former campaign head, still former, but in
[29:28.280 --> 29:32.080]  transition and down the witnesses are coming out that she was falling down drunk stumbling
[29:32.080 --> 29:33.080]  around.
[29:33.080 --> 29:34.080]  This is all made up.
[29:34.080 --> 29:38.560]  So these people do so that's all coming up and we're going to get into a bunch of clips
[29:38.560 --> 29:41.680]  the latest on the election and our crew was in New York yesterday.
[29:41.680 --> 29:42.680]  Now they're in Denver.
[29:42.680 --> 29:43.680]  We have a lot of floods.
[29:43.680 --> 29:44.680]  We can't play it.
[29:44.680 --> 29:47.840]  It was all the cussing because the anti-Trump people do not talk.
[29:47.840 --> 29:50.760]  All they do is cuss and spit and run around in circles.
[29:50.760 --> 29:51.760]  They attack people.
[29:51.760 --> 30:00.240]  It was amazing, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.240 --> 30:05.680]  A Connecticut judge has placed herself above the Constitution and above an explicit congressional
[30:05.680 --> 30:06.680]  law.
[30:06.680 --> 30:12.240]  Judge Barbara Bellis has ruled that Sandy Hook families can sue gun manufacturers, Remington,
[30:12.240 --> 30:18.120]  Bushmaster and others, but Congress has already explicitly protected firearm manufacturers
[30:18.120 --> 30:22.920]  from liability and the protection of Lawful Commerce and Arms Act, which says they will
[30:22.920 --> 30:29.760]  not be held liable for quote, the harm caused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse
[30:29.760 --> 30:34.720]  firearm products or ammunition products that function as designed and intended.
[30:34.720 --> 30:38.760]  The act goes on to explain to people with an anti-gun agenda like Judge Bellis that
[30:38.760 --> 30:44.520]  quote the possibility of imposing liability on an entire industry for harm that is solely
[30:44.520 --> 30:49.120]  caused by others is an abuse of the legal system, unquote.
[30:49.120 --> 30:50.120]  What's next?
[30:50.120 --> 30:54.040]  Holding Ford liable for a drunk driver killing someone with the car that they made?
[30:54.040 --> 30:57.600]  If Hillary Clinton has her way, that's what they will do to gun manufacturers.
[30:57.600 --> 31:00.080]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.

[32:10.800 --> 32:12.720]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[32:12.720 --> 32:18.360]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine
[32:18.360 --> 32:19.360]  products.

[32:27.440 --> 32:30.440]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX, Nacinotide.
[32:30.440 --> 32:31.440]  Why?
[32:31.440 --> 32:32.440]  Let me ask you a question.
[32:32.440 --> 32:33.440]  Have they worked for you?
[32:33.440 --> 32:36.040]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[32:36.040 --> 32:37.040]  What products are you taking?
[32:37.040 --> 32:38.040]  Are you taking?
[32:38.040 --> 32:43.480]  I'm a SuperMail to BrainForce, to Wintersun, X2.
[32:43.480 --> 32:49.040]  Even got a little DNA force, so I just free up everything, and I just went to Autoville.
[32:49.040 --> 32:54.120]  Visit infowarslifes.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourselves.
[32:54.120 --> 33:19.600]  Visit infowarslifes.com or call 888-253-3139.
[33:19.600 --> 33:25.320]  That's live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:49.600 --> 33:55.320]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central, we are here broadcasting worldwide.
[33:55.320 --> 33:57.600]  It's 12 noon to 4 p.m. Eastern.
[33:57.600 --> 34:00.120]  What is that?
[34:00.120 --> 34:02.120]  9 to 2 Pacific?
[34:02.120 --> 34:03.120]  10 to...
[34:03.120 --> 34:09.040]  I tell you, there's just so much going on in this world, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm
[34:09.040 --> 34:12.960]  in an attempt right now to go over a lot of the news before all these guests start joining
[34:12.960 --> 34:16.400]  us.
[34:16.400 --> 34:23.920]  Let's go ahead and get back into the Trump right now.
[34:23.920 --> 34:27.880]  So I went over the fact there's a lot of news articles, mainstream news now saying, you
[34:27.880 --> 34:31.600]  know, you really need to go with the popular vote.
[34:31.600 --> 34:33.400]  This is not a contested deal.
[34:33.400 --> 34:34.400]  He's way ahead.
[34:34.400 --> 34:36.600]  He's going to be way ahead on the East Coast.
[34:36.600 --> 34:42.640]  What do you mean you're going to ignore the popular vote at Cleveland and maybe even give
[34:42.640 --> 34:52.080]  it to Paul Ryan or somebody else like Casey because they don't really want Cruz either
[34:52.080 --> 34:53.880]  even though he's establishment.
[34:53.880 --> 35:00.400]  He hasn't been around long enough, but they might go for that.
[35:00.400 --> 35:04.120]  Sarah Palin says voters should decide GOP nominee.
[35:04.120 --> 35:06.360]  Imagine you have to even say that in America.
[35:06.360 --> 35:12.520]  Voters should decide a nominee who's then going to run for president.
[35:12.520 --> 35:17.760]  Of course, we're voting on the Republican we want.
[35:17.760 --> 35:23.240]  If it's appointed by a party, then the parties will just get together and create a dictatorship,
[35:23.240 --> 35:25.720]  a rig deal, which they're trying to do.
[35:25.720 --> 35:30.680]  I mean, they've been joined at the hip for a long time, but this is like them doing the
[35:30.680 --> 35:33.920]  deed in front of everybody.
[35:33.920 --> 35:38.800]  Associated Press voters will rise up in opposition to Republican power brokers, try to take the
[35:38.800 --> 35:42.880]  presidential nominee away from Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, the GOP convention this summer.
[35:42.880 --> 35:48.960]  Sarah Palin said Thursday in a wide-ranging interview with the Associated Press.
[35:48.960 --> 35:50.360]  I didn't even say rise up.
[35:50.360 --> 35:54.320]  I said go demonstrate for our First Amendment rights because that's what voting is.
[35:54.320 --> 35:58.280]  Jury rights, grand jury rights, the speech, the press, religion, it's all in the First
[35:58.280 --> 35:59.280]  Amendment.
[35:59.280 --> 36:04.000]  It's under some other amendments as well, but it's all inculcated there.
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.200]  Are they going to call her a terrorist?
[36:05.200 --> 36:06.200]  Call for her arrest?
[36:06.200 --> 36:08.600]  I mean, Roger Stone didn't say rise up.
[36:08.600 --> 36:18.280]  And they're in the Washington Post, CNN, CNBC, MSNBC calling for his arrest.
[36:18.280 --> 36:21.440]  And playing clips of this show implying I'm violent.
[36:21.440 --> 36:26.960]  News articles, they had me in there saying, Jones, once a day of rage, violence, oh my
[36:26.960 --> 36:27.960]  gosh.
[36:27.960 --> 36:32.320]  Oh yes, I'm so looking for violence, yeah, right.
[36:32.320 --> 36:35.440]  I'm fighting to try to stop it.
[36:35.440 --> 36:40.720]  I'm trying to stop the George Soros funded groups out there trying to start a war and
[36:40.720 --> 36:43.280]  the streets shooting police.
[36:43.280 --> 36:50.320]  I have oath keepers on that has a national initiative for overwatch, for citizens and
[36:50.320 --> 36:54.400]  police alike so that this doesn't continue.
[36:54.400 --> 36:56.920]  And it's not about groveling to the police.
[36:56.920 --> 36:59.600]  The globalists are taking the country down.
[36:59.600 --> 37:02.640]  They want to attack local government and order.
[37:02.640 --> 37:07.720]  That's what terrorists do.
[37:07.720 --> 37:12.520]  And there's a video on infowars.com that needs to go mega viral.
[37:12.520 --> 37:15.080]  Drugs report is linked to our story.
[37:15.080 --> 37:19.040]  China says Russia humiliated arrogant US with simulated attack on warship.
[37:19.040 --> 37:20.200]  And I'm glad drugs linked to that.
[37:20.200 --> 37:25.200]  But the story that's really important.
[37:25.200 --> 37:28.480]  And then I need the listeners to put on Facebook, Twitter, where you can get it out everywhere
[37:28.480 --> 37:36.240]  is the videos that our crew got in Manhattan yesterday.
[37:36.240 --> 37:37.240]  And they're so hardworking.
[37:37.240 --> 37:38.720]  They're already in Denver right now.
[37:38.720 --> 37:41.200]  They're going to be on in the fourth hour.
[37:41.200 --> 37:43.520]  And there's a whole bunch of these videos.
[37:43.520 --> 37:50.920]  And because the Bernie Hillary supporters cannot talk, all they do is scream threats
[37:50.920 --> 37:51.920]  and cuss words.
[37:51.920 --> 37:52.920]  We cannot play it here.
[37:52.920 --> 37:56.440]  Because it would just be beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[37:56.440 --> 37:59.640]  I mean, that's all it would be.
[37:59.640 --> 38:08.000]  There is a man up there at the Trump rally, not attacking people, but saying, defend yourself.
[38:08.000 --> 38:09.000]  There are sleeper cells.
[38:09.000 --> 38:10.000]  There is ISIS here.
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.240]  You need to protect yourself.
[38:12.240 --> 38:16.080]  And they start grabbing a sign, trying to rip it away, start grabbing his sunglasses,
[38:16.080 --> 38:17.080]  grabbing his hat.
[38:17.080 --> 38:20.880]  Then he pushes them back, and then they attack him and beat him up.
[38:20.880 --> 38:22.800]  And the police don't do anything.
[38:22.800 --> 38:27.440]  There are police on video with some of the Black Lives Matter people saying, I'm going
[38:27.440 --> 38:33.280]  to attack you, I'm going to physically assault you and cussing at them, and the police do
[38:33.280 --> 38:34.780]  nothing.
[38:34.780 --> 38:38.480]  I mean, it's disorderly conduct to say, I'm going to physically attack you.
[38:38.480 --> 38:46.400]  And I guarantee you, I've been arrested in New York for protesting the firefighters and
[38:46.400 --> 38:49.640]  police not getting funding the first responders.
[38:49.640 --> 38:52.560]  I was literally protesting at Fox News over that.
[38:52.560 --> 38:57.280]  This video of it, and the police came and arrested me and almost tore my shoulder out
[38:57.280 --> 38:58.280]  of socket.
[38:58.280 --> 39:06.080]  They put the handcuffs on so tight and so high on my back.
[39:06.080 --> 39:09.080]  And I did nothing.
[39:09.080 --> 39:10.080]  Nothing.
[39:10.080 --> 39:12.080]  Man, my privilege really worked out there, didn't it?
[39:12.080 --> 39:15.640]  And am I going to just hate the cops because of that?
[39:15.640 --> 39:17.800]  No, they followed their evil orders.
[39:17.800 --> 39:21.600]  They followed what that big city machine wanted.
[39:21.600 --> 39:26.160]  Just like the Black Lives Matter are allowed to beat this guy up, and I'm not allowed to
[39:26.160 --> 39:32.640]  have a demonstration about the cover-up of the dust on 9-11 and media cover-up.
[39:32.640 --> 39:34.880]  Because see, I'm a good person.
[39:34.880 --> 39:37.320]  People are going to listen to me.
[39:37.320 --> 39:39.600]  What I'm saying will really help the country.
[39:39.600 --> 39:46.240]  So see, I can't be allowed to be out there, but if I'm part of a group whose ideological
[39:46.240 --> 39:53.960]  leader is a cop killer that lives in Cuba, and if I go around singing chants about killing
[39:53.960 --> 40:00.280]  police, I would be allowed to tell the police that I'm going to physically attack them and
[40:00.280 --> 40:06.880]  menace them with my fist balled up in a fighting stance.
[40:06.880 --> 40:18.960]  Now, there's a leftist George Soros privilege to destabilize this country, and the behavior
[40:18.960 --> 40:22.800]  of people like Black Lives Matter will then legitimize, and I don't think it actually
[40:22.800 --> 40:26.160]  does legitimize it, but it'll legitimize it in some people's minds, when crazy mentally
[40:26.160 --> 40:30.680]  ill cops shoot some innocent person, be they white, black, or whatever in the back.
[40:30.680 --> 40:31.680]  And that goes on.
[40:31.680 --> 40:34.720]  Those cops need to get in trouble.
[40:34.720 --> 40:38.760]  That is a couple hundred people shot a year improperly by police.
[40:38.760 --> 40:45.440]  That's the number, 150, 200, it varies, period.
[40:45.440 --> 40:47.160]  Is that the number one issue in this country?
[40:47.160 --> 40:48.160]  No.
[40:48.160 --> 40:51.160]  And you can look right at Black Lives Matter person with all their hate and all their craziness.
[40:51.160 --> 40:58.480]  In fact, show for the TV viewers some of the footage of the guy, the articles on M4s.com,
[40:58.480 --> 41:00.480]  Black Lives Matter threatens to attack police.
[41:00.480 --> 41:02.280]  I believe it's the headline.
[41:02.280 --> 41:03.280]  It's not the headline.
[41:03.280 --> 41:04.280]  It should be.
[41:04.280 --> 41:07.480]  The guy is just whacked out of his mind, so angry and so hateful, threatening everybody
[41:07.480 --> 41:13.560]  to beat him up for their free speech, and telling the Black Trump supporters how dare
[41:13.560 --> 41:21.800]  you be supporting him, and just basically in a Tasmanian devil rage, all because he
[41:21.800 --> 41:27.280]  really believes that this is a bunch of racists that are out to getting.
[41:27.280 --> 41:32.520]  And the guy is so angry, he just keeps saying, in between cuss words, Donald Trump isn't
[41:32.520 --> 41:33.520]  going to help.
[41:33.520 --> 41:42.240]  He's going to get your taxes screaming at this Black woman, or group of Black women.
[41:42.240 --> 41:46.560]  And then if we can, I want to show the footage when they physically attacked video, anti-Trump
[41:46.560 --> 41:53.200]  mob assault Trump supporter left his rip sign, throw punches at man, steal his sunglasses.
[41:53.200 --> 41:54.200]  Infowars.com.
[41:54.200 --> 42:03.200]  And then there's also, I mean, I love that these lepers cannot
[42:03.200 --> 42:04.200]  fight.
[42:04.200 --> 42:07.440]  I mean, I'll just tell you right now that, I mean, I'm not bragging, but I would literally
[42:07.440 --> 42:12.120]  have just absolutely devastated all those people in about 10 seconds.
[42:12.120 --> 42:15.440]  I mean, I just, I guess they've never actually actually punched them upside the head full
[42:15.440 --> 42:16.440]  power.
[42:16.440 --> 42:22.440]  I mean, I just, watching these people attack, it's like wimp punches and pawing and just,
[42:22.440 --> 42:27.800]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[42:27.800 --> 42:31.520]  Black Lives Matter threatens violence against white to vote Trump.
[42:31.520 --> 42:35.040]  Yeah, that's from, that's from a few weeks ago.
[42:35.040 --> 42:36.880]  The latest one's up on infowars.com.
[42:36.880 --> 42:37.880]  You guys just shut it up.
[42:37.880 --> 42:38.880]  Yeah.
[42:38.880 --> 42:39.880]  That's it.
[42:39.880 --> 42:42.960]  And it's, it's, it's, again, we can't play it because of all the cursing.
[42:42.960 --> 42:46.600]  But he tells the cops, I'm going to knock you out.
[42:46.600 --> 42:48.480]  I'm going to take you out.
[42:48.480 --> 42:50.880]  I'm going to jump you.
[42:50.880 --> 42:53.560]  And they just sit there and take it.
[42:53.560 --> 42:57.280]  And I've had the same New York police, I don't mean those cops come up to me when I'm a hundred
[42:57.280 --> 43:01.720]  yards away, showing a protest against the Iraq war and threatened to arrest me with hatred.
[43:01.720 --> 43:05.080]  And I was polite to them and the guy got off on it more.
[43:05.080 --> 43:11.120]  But see, he knows that the system is backing those leftist thugs, so they know to leave
[43:11.120 --> 43:12.120]  them alone.
[43:12.120 --> 43:14.640]  So I tell you, the police are shameful.
[43:14.640 --> 43:15.800]  And so are those thugs.
[43:15.800 --> 43:17.960]  I mean, you just, you're all a bunch of cowards.
[43:17.960 --> 43:19.880]  I don't mean all the police, obviously.
[43:19.880 --> 43:26.760]  I'm talking about police that will peep, that sit there and let people do that.
[43:26.760 --> 43:30.800]  I mean, I've never seen a cop that lets you push them like that guy just did and in their
[43:30.800 --> 43:33.120]  face and then he threatens to hit them.
[43:33.120 --> 43:37.200]  It's just wrong that I've been arrested in New York and over and over again, been treated
[43:37.200 --> 43:44.360]  like crap when I'm exercising my first amendment that a lot of people died for.
[43:44.360 --> 43:49.360]  And because I'm a good person, I'm not allowed to.
[43:49.360 --> 43:53.640]  But a bunch of crazy people are and I say, let them, but don't let them beat people up
[43:53.640 --> 44:00.840]  and the cops were 10 feet away and let them do it because they're intimidated by it.
[44:00.840 --> 44:01.840]  They're intimidated by what?
[44:01.840 --> 44:06.560]  Is it four New York cops last year and shot in the head just randomly?
[44:06.560 --> 44:12.160]  I mean, if you're so scared of George Soros, these people, what's going to happen when
[44:12.160 --> 44:15.960]  you start a war with the veterans and the Patriots?
[44:15.960 --> 44:17.040]  And the gloves come off there.
[44:17.040 --> 44:24.360]  If you're scared of these Black Lives Matter and communist and these other idiot groups,
[44:24.360 --> 44:25.360]  I'm digressing.
[44:25.360 --> 44:26.360]  I'm just sick of it.
[44:26.360 --> 44:31.240]  I personally am really tired of it.
[44:31.240 --> 44:38.480]  So here are these articles, video, violent anti-Trump mob assaults, Trump supporters,
[44:38.480 --> 44:51.800]  hang Trump effigy, beat up Trump impersonator outside New York GOP convention.
[44:51.800 --> 44:55.680]  Trump chalking by college Republicans is a hate crime.
[44:55.680 --> 45:00.200]  Black students claim chalking threatens our tax exempt status.
[45:00.200 --> 45:01.200]  Oh, yes.
[45:01.200 --> 45:05.760]  See, no one can have speech now at a school or a church because it's tax exempt.
[45:05.760 --> 45:09.120]  We shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise
[45:09.120 --> 45:10.120]  thereof.
[45:10.120 --> 45:18.080]  And individuals at a church or at a college undoubtedly have their free speech.
[45:18.080 --> 45:20.280]  But this is an attempt to go after our free speech.
[45:20.280 --> 45:26.200]  Bill Nye, the science guy, got asked by Mr. Moreno, climate depot, if he agreed with the
[45:26.200 --> 45:32.400]  UN and others that are calling for the arrest of people that deny global warming, manmade
[45:32.400 --> 45:33.400]  global warming.
[45:33.400 --> 45:34.400]  Now it's manmade climate change.
[45:34.400 --> 45:35.960]  He said, no, we should look at it.
[45:35.960 --> 45:40.960]  This is the standard position, but look, he's a little non-threatening guy with a bow tie
[45:40.960 --> 45:44.960]  telling you that polar bears can't swim.
[45:44.960 --> 45:53.680]  In fact, let's play a clip of that just to dovetail with all the censorship every day
[45:53.680 --> 46:00.160]  that we see ongoing the attempt to bully us into total submission.
[46:00.160 --> 46:07.240]  This guy, Bill Nye, let's discuss criminalizing climate deniers.
[46:07.240 --> 46:10.440]  And this is being pushed by the New York Attorney General and others.
[46:10.440 --> 46:16.280]  And then Barbara Boxer will play a tax Catholic priest for questioning global warming.
[46:16.280 --> 46:18.560]  So see, it's all about being bullied.
[46:18.560 --> 46:19.880]  And what did the New York governor say?
[46:19.880 --> 46:22.920]  He said, if you're pro-gun or pro-life, get out.
[46:22.920 --> 46:23.920]  And they later said, are you serious?
[46:23.920 --> 46:26.560]  He said, yeah, get out.
[46:26.560 --> 46:27.560]  They're bullies.
[46:27.560 --> 46:30.320]  They believe their time has come.
[46:30.320 --> 46:31.320]  They're gangsters.
[46:31.320 --> 46:35.560]  And the Donald Trump comes and says, we should not have open borders and pay for everything
[46:35.560 --> 46:36.560]  free.
[46:36.560 --> 46:41.280]  And if they're not vetting any of the Muslims coming in, stop it all till it's vetted.
[46:41.280 --> 46:43.480]  Absolutely.
[46:43.480 --> 46:45.080]  And they go, oh, that's so hateful.
[46:45.080 --> 46:47.560]  And people then get to feel hurt.
[46:47.560 --> 46:49.200]  It's like you own something now to be hurt.
[46:49.200 --> 46:50.360]  Like, I get to be hurt good.
[46:50.360 --> 46:53.480]  I get to be hurt.
[46:53.480 --> 46:58.200]  Meanwhile, Mexico gives you six months to a year hard labor if you're caught coming in
[46:58.200 --> 47:07.160]  from Latin America and tortures you to find out where more illegals are hiding.
[47:07.160 --> 47:09.040]  That's in the London Guardian, by the way.
[47:09.040 --> 47:13.200]  No one is tougher on borders in Latin America than Mexico.
[47:13.200 --> 47:19.600]  It's one of the worst countries for illegals in the world except for North Korea.
[47:19.600 --> 47:21.280]  I mean, they don't put up.
[47:21.280 --> 47:26.720]  Japan doesn't let one Muslim immigrate there.
[47:26.720 --> 47:31.320]  Japan has the lowest crime rate in that area of the world, probably the world after Switzerland.
[47:31.320 --> 47:35.680]  Where they're hard to immigrate there, too.
[47:35.680 --> 47:37.000]  Japanese just leaves their doors wide open.
[47:37.000 --> 47:42.760]  There's almost zero crime in Japan.
[47:42.760 --> 47:46.480]  Now let's go ahead and go to Bill Nye.
[47:46.480 --> 47:50.240]  Time to talk about arresting people for their free speech.
[47:50.240 --> 47:53.200]  He ties it to cigarettes and stuff like that.
[47:53.200 --> 47:57.480]  No, the cigarette companies knew and paid people to produce false science.
[47:57.480 --> 48:01.640]  We are saying it's the sun and we're saying there's a carbon scam where you want, so you're
[48:01.640 --> 48:04.840]  the ones that are pushing a lie for money gain.
[48:04.840 --> 48:08.240]  You're the ones involved in racketeering, not us, here it is.
[48:08.240 --> 48:11.840]  We interviewed Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the environmentalist here at the People's Climate
[48:11.840 --> 48:14.800]  March in 2014, September.
[48:14.800 --> 48:20.440]  He said that the climate deniers, his word, energy CEOs belong at the Hague with three
[48:20.440 --> 48:24.040]  square meals and a cot with all the other war criminals.
[48:24.040 --> 48:25.040]  What is your thought on that?
[48:25.040 --> 48:28.120]  Do you think some of the rhetoric on your side, as I'm sure both sides, but some of
[48:28.120 --> 48:29.840]  the rhetoric on your side gets too carried away?
[48:29.840 --> 48:33.760]  I mean, what's your thought on jailing skeptics as war criminals?
[48:33.760 --> 48:35.280]  We'll see what happens.
[48:35.280 --> 48:38.040]  Was it appropriate to jail the guys from Enron?
[48:38.040 --> 48:39.040]  Interesting.
[48:39.040 --> 48:40.360]  Okay, right.
[48:40.360 --> 48:45.480]  So we'll see what happens if, was it appropriate to jail people from the cigarette industry
[48:45.480 --> 48:50.600]  who insisted that this addictive product was not addictive and so on.
[48:50.600 --> 48:58.000]  And you think about, in these cases, for me as a taxpayer and voter, the introduction
[48:58.000 --> 49:03.280]  of this extreme doubt, when you go with extreme doubt, about climate change is affecting my
[49:03.280 --> 49:06.360]  quality of life as a public citizen.
[49:06.360 --> 49:11.960]  So I can see where people are very concerned about this and are pursuing criminal investigations
[49:11.960 --> 49:40.640]  as well as engaging in discussions like this.
[49:40.640 --> 49:43.440]  Al Gore's written about this before Enron got exposed.
[49:43.440 --> 49:49.680]  Do you know who developed carbon taxes and the global carbon trading scheme within Enron,
[49:49.680 --> 49:50.680]  Charles?
[49:50.680 --> 49:57.680]  This is mainstream news, Enron, Enron, Enron.
[49:57.680 --> 50:00.280]  It's an Enron scam.
[50:00.280 --> 50:07.000]  And then he uses their own scam organization as the reason we lose free speech.
[50:07.000 --> 50:10.480]  They fix energy prices and that wasn't enough to make a billion dollars a day sometimes
[50:10.480 --> 50:11.480]  in California.
[50:11.480 --> 50:15.760]  Enron environmentalism, the carbon credit scam pumps millions of tons of greenhouse gas
[50:15.760 --> 50:16.760]  into the atmosphere.
[50:16.760 --> 50:17.760]  Boom.
[50:17.760 --> 50:18.760]  Mainstream article.
[50:18.760 --> 50:20.880]  Let's play the Enron Club.
[50:20.880 --> 50:22.160]  Here it is.
[50:22.160 --> 50:25.040]  Was it appropriate to jail the guys from Enron?
[50:25.040 --> 50:26.040]  Interesting.
[50:26.040 --> 50:27.200]  Okay, right.
[50:27.200 --> 50:28.480]  So we'll see what happens.
[50:28.480 --> 50:29.480]  Oh, you see?
[50:29.480 --> 50:30.480]  Oh, oh, oh.
[50:30.480 --> 50:35.360]  Man, you know, it's like I'll be watching CNN and they got a guy saying I'm dangerous
[50:35.360 --> 50:37.360]  and bad, don't listen to me.
[50:37.360 --> 50:38.360]  And I go, wait a minute.
[50:38.360 --> 50:43.400]  I'm reading about an analyst at the Pentagon running a bunch of stuff, a buck sexton.
[50:43.400 --> 50:44.400]  I think that guy's CIA.
[50:44.400 --> 50:45.400]  Will you look him up?
[50:45.400 --> 50:46.400]  He's CIA.
[50:46.400 --> 50:49.640]  They don't get on TV and say, hey, I'm CIA up here going after Alex Jones.
[50:49.640 --> 50:51.320]  But see, I remember.
[50:51.320 --> 50:56.880]  I remember and I remember who came up with the carbon scam, Bill Nye, man, you're an
[50:56.880 --> 50:57.880]  enemy of freedom.
[50:57.880 --> 50:58.880]  What a tyrant.
[50:58.880 --> 51:05.800]  There's nothing more enticing and intoxicating than the finest meat cooking on an open flame.

[51:59.080 --> 52:02.320]  Hello, I'm Michael Reagan.
[52:02.320 --> 52:07.960]  My father, President Ronald Reagan, believes so strongly in gold they change gold ownership
[52:07.960 --> 52:13.160]  forever by bringing back physical gold to the American public, allowing gold coins to
[52:13.160 --> 52:19.160]  be minted and sold to U.S. citizens just like you, starting in 1985.
[52:19.160 --> 52:24.000]  Gold ownership can help protect your financial future, especially when our national debt is
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  spiraling out of control.
[52:26.000 --> 52:30.920]  Many smart Americans have kept their retirements from being wiped out during America's financial
[52:30.920 --> 52:33.720]  crisis thanks to physical gold coins.
[52:33.720 --> 52:41.400]  I strongly urge you to call the U.S. Money Reserve at 1-866-944-GOLD or go online to
[52:41.400 --> 52:43.240]  usmoneyreserve.com.
[52:43.240 --> 52:48.520]  As for a special gold guide with new never before released information about gold from
[52:48.520 --> 52:57.240]  the U.S. Money Reserve, call 1-866-944-GOLD or go online to usmoneyreserve.com.
[52:57.240 --> 52:58.240]  I'm Michael Reagan.
[52:58.240 --> 53:27.040]  Thank you.
[53:58.240 --> 54:20.240]  I'm Michael Reagan and I'm from U.S. Money Reserve at 1-866-944-GOLD and I'm from U.S.
[54:20.240 --> 54:47.240]  Money Reserve at 1-866-944-GOLD and I'm from U.S. Money Reserve at 1-866-944-GOLD and
[54:47.240 --> 55:13.580]  I'm from U.S. Money Reserve at 1-866-944-GOLD and I'm from U.S. Money Reserve at 1-866-944-GOLD
[55:13.580 --> 55:19.820]  more. I want to get more into this whole climate change situation with Barber Boxer where
[55:19.820 --> 55:24.860]  it's all about shaming us now and nudging us and henpecking us and dominating us. We
[55:24.860 --> 55:30.100]  may have to arrest you. Yeah, we're going to go shut down the Trump rallies too. We're
[55:30.100 --> 55:34.180]  going to beat up people and the cops aren't going to do anything even though we run around
[55:34.180 --> 55:42.700]  these groups calling for attacking the police because it's what the establishment wants.
[55:42.700 --> 55:46.920]  Maybe our crews are all over the place. We're working very hard. We're trying to fund coverage
[55:46.920 --> 55:50.980]  in Cleveland and Bilderberg coming up next month and so much more. We've got the best

[56:17.980 --> 56:24.420]  have fillers in them and are a bigger bottle cost $60. We have less capitalets in it and
[56:24.420 --> 56:28.580]  it has a lower price. But if we did the fillers and stuff, it'd be a huge bottle and have
[56:28.580 --> 56:38.260]  more capitalets in it, but we don't do fillers and it'd be $60. $22. Okay, so it is $45.
[56:38.260 --> 56:46.820]  25% off its regular retail and it's got the 30 capitalets in it and just try it out today.
[56:46.820 --> 56:49.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, a lot of folks want to be able to get a bigger bottle at a higher

[56:53.580 --> 56:58.140]  But this is the best Neutropic we could come up with, the best formula period. We go out
[56:58.140 --> 57:01.780]  and find what is the most organic, what is the safest, what is the most hardcore. Read

[57:57.180 --> 58:02.300]  of every form at every level and I literally rely on God and I pray for your prayers. I
[58:02.300 --> 58:06.780]  need your prayers and I need providence. I'm committed, I'm going to do everything I've
[58:06.780 --> 58:12.060]  got to do. I'm not going to stop ever. I just need your support and your prayers and I appreciate
[58:12.060 --> 58:16.220]  it. So to our affiliates and everybody else who supports the info war and Lord knows I'm
[58:16.220 --> 58:20.380]  not perfect, I'm doing the best I can before God. People say, man, why all the God stuff
[58:20.380 --> 58:24.660]  you're not equipped. Look, this is, I believe in God. It's how I cope. Okay. There are no
[58:24.660 --> 58:28.940]  atheists and foxholes and let me tell you, live my life and then just, I couldn't do this
[58:28.940 --> 58:34.580]  if I didn't have God to lean on. That's what it comes down to. I just get stronger as the
[58:34.580 --> 58:37.860]  attacks intensify though, because God's a rock. The closer I get to God, the stronger
[58:37.860 --> 58:42.340]  I get. We'll be back. Stay with us in force. Life.com supports us today. Thank you for

[59:54.300 --> 01:00:08.140]  show. From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:23.540]  continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. We're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:27.380]  Larry Nichols is popping in with breaking news. Colonel Rob Manis running for Senate
[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:31.860]  Louisiana is popping in. Peter Schiff, Rob Dew is going to be on the road with the rest
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:36.980]  of the crew, Joe Biggs and others coming up in the fourth hour with David Knight. They
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:41.580]  were going to be on the third hour but they're really sleepy. They just got in from New York
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:46.020]  and were up till two in the morning last night. Flew out at 7am this morning on a New York
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:50.380]  and so they're in Denver taking a nap right now. The demonstration starts at what is it?
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:56.940]  4 o'clock. No, 3 o'clock. Mountain standard time. 3 o'clock. Mountain. So that's 4 o'clock
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:02.300]  here. So we're talking about four hours and they're going to be covering that live. Live
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:10.260]  feeds on the Skype. In fact, I suggest that, I should have told you guys this earlier,
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:13.940]  we probably just need to go ahead and boot things up and maybe just stream over our own
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:20.900]  systems there or they can use Ustream or whatever for their safety. But so many of the anti-Trump
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:27.340]  folks are attacking cameras and they've also promised to dress up an Info Wars outfit to
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:34.140]  provocateur us. We have that from inside sources. So we'll know their names. We'll know what
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:39.700]  group they came from. God knows if the police will do anything though in this country because
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:45.900]  I guess if you're an American patriot, follow the law and are a good person and you're against
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:50.900]  shooting police in the back of the head, you don't get any police support. At least in
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:56.820]  these places like Denver and New York. I've been attacked in Denver by the stupid anarchist
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:01.980]  people, communist. Everything with them is a lie. They'll call themselves anarchists
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:06.100]  and they got communist tattoos and red flags and hammers and sickles because their bosses
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:09.380]  tell them there's no communists and we don't want the public to know we're a communist.
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:15.220]  So call yourselves an anarchist. They're always in black and they always talk about killing
[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:21.620]  babies. Now they love the devil and how they love being ugly. Who do these people come
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:27.420]  from? Why is there so much garbage out there? I just, I don't understand all these people
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:34.860]  that love evil. I don't want to take them. They take our restraint for weakness and man,
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:38.380]  I tell you, you really are pushing it hard. That's all I'm going to tell you right now.
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:43.820]  You're really pushing it hard. All you evil people, you're going to get it. Just know
[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:51.580]  that sooner or later, God's going to cut you down. But maybe we should come in with that
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:03:00.780]  Johnny Cash. You can run on for a long time. Run on for a long time. Sooner or later, cut
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:08.820]  you down. Sooner or later, God's going to cut you down. Yeah, plotting the dark against
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:20.820]  your fellow man. What's done in the dark will be brought to light. I already played Bill
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:23.900]  nine of science guys and yeah, we should look at arresting people that don't believe in
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:27.540]  manmade global climate change. Don't want to pay their good carbon taxes because Enron
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:35.500]  was a scam. Well, Enron was engaged in energy trading fraud. What does that mean? Enron
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:44.180]  created the carbon tax scam with Al Gore and the Rothschilds on record. The irony of these
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:51.780]  people, the criminality of it, but let's play Barbara Boxer attacking a Catholic priest for
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:57.420]  questioning global warming. Let's play that clip. This is one of the greatest moral crimes.
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:02.540]  If you make energy more expensive or you prohibit or restrict people from getting energy from
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:10.300]  sources like coal, that's literally death. Mr. Epstein, are you a scientist? No, philosopher.
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:15.340]  You're a philosopher. Yes. Okay. That money's a lesson. That's true. That's the environment
[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:19.420]  and public works committee. I think it's interesting. We have a philosopher here talking about an
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:22.620]  issue. It's to teach you how to think more clearly. Well, you don't have to teach me
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:26.340]  how to think more clearly. Yeah, she's got an inner on scale. Try running for the Senate
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:32.660]  on your platform. Reverend Nelson, perhaps the most, well, this is the place to have
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:37.940]  a philosopher, not a scientist. It's perfect for this Republican. You have to integrate
[01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:42.740]  the big picture data. I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you that all you have to know
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:47.620]  is you're a philosopher, not a scientist, and I don't appreciate getting lectured by
[01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:53.060]  a philosopher about science. Now, I want to talk to you. I can ask you what I want.
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:57.700]  Do you disagree with the Pope on climate change? It's as simple as yes or no. When the Pope
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:03.260]  says... We'll be back, stay with us. A seismologist warns that catastrophic mega-earthquakes
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:09.100]  are on their way after five major earthquakes took place in the last 48 hours. Seismologist
[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:14.020]  Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado has made headlines all over the world by warning
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:19.900]  that current conditions might trigger at least four earthquakes greater than 8.0 in magnitude.
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:23.580]  If his projections are accurate, our planet could be on the precipice of a wave of natural
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:28.900]  disasters unlike anything that any of us have witnessed before. A single magnitude 8.0 earthquake
[01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:34.020]  in a populated area would be a disaster of historic proportions, but four of them, that
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:39.060]  would be a complete and utter nightmare. And according to Volcano Discovery, 38 volcanoes
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:43.860]  around the globe are erupting right now. Michael Snyder asks, why is this happening?
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:49.460]  Why is the crust of the earth shaking so violently all of a sudden? In Matthew 24, Jesus warned
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:53.820]  us that there would be earthquakes in diverse places just prior to his return. Are we truly
[01:05:53.820 --> 01:06:22.500]  in the times that the Bible refers to as the last days? Read more right now at infowars.com.
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:27.260]  We've been to the supermail and the superfemale vitality, big changes, a lot of energy, we've
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:32.100]  gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've been a ton of money there.
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:37.820]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated,
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:42.820]  or maximum potency. They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just
[01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:46.660]  cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:51.140]  gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source. So it's pretty exciting and
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:56.980]  I love it. Visit infowarslife.com today to secure your supermail vitality and other powerful

[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:19.380]  scientists, and the answer is clear. Iodine is key, is paramount, and there's still so
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:23.540]  much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:29.340]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7000 feet to gather these purple
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:34.540]  blue crystals to extract the ultra pure iodine. On top of that, we also screen our iodine
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:39.340]  for radiation before bottling. It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there. Quite
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:43.940]  frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine, that major
[01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:48.100]  brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:53.500]  they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have. It is exclusive
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:08:21.060]  to infowarslife.com and the infowarslife family of incredible products.
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:38.820]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.

[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:31.660]  We live in a very epic time on this world right now. Everybody can see it and Larry
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:38.220]  Nichols is somebody that saw it. Green Beret, Commando, all over the world fighting communists
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:44.420]  recruited into the shadow government. Dixie Mafia, that's what it is in the south, brought
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:48.420]  the Clintons into power, was there, saw Meena Ark and saw the drug deal on the dead kids
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:53.140]  and said I'm not going to be part of it anymore and went public against them. And he's the
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:57.540]  guy that helped bring forward the information that began the impeachment. And he's the
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:04.700]  fellow that got ostracized, demonized and attacked by these folks. And Larry Nichols
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:10.020]  is our guest here today, just for the next 20 minutes or so. He's got some breaking news
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:15.220]  and intel for us. Then we have a man running for Senate colonel, Rob Manis, popping in,
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:18.780]  Peter Schiff on what's happened with the economy. We've got Rob doing the rest of our crew from
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:23.340]  Denver. They'll be at the side of the demonstration. We'll see all the infall warriors converge
[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:30.060]  on that. On the west steps of the Colorado State Capitol building, 200 each Colfax Avenue,
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:34.020]  Denver, Colorado. And they're going to be in Portland where the left has said no. One
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:37.940]  is allowed to be there for the student groups to speak. No Trump supporters are allowed.
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:42.980]  They attacked them last week. Six Trump supporters peacefully there. And so our crew is going
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:47.180]  as listed speakers to speak to their group and we'll be there and witness what happens.
[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:51.540]  Hope you come there and support the first amendment. We expect the college to actually
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:56.380]  help them attack the crew. The crew is ready. They wanted to go to illustrate. They'll be
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:11:00.460]  like Gandhi. I mean, I've told them, let them hit you if you want or defend yourself, but
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:03.460]  they're going to let them hit them first. They're there to, and I'm sure it'll be on
[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:08.340]  the news that we're evil and bad. This is something Joe Biggs and Rob Do-it-Others want
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:14.780]  to be part of and to defend the first amendment. The good news is a lot of CBS News, US News
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:18.660]  World Report, even Associated Press are going, you know, you really should count votes in
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:22.900]  primaries. This is not something that's been done before where you just ignore them. Now
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:27.460]  stop it. This is a dictatorship. Quit. So the public didn't buy it. The major media
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:31.260]  tried to sell it. It didn't work. So now they're backing off that a little bit. That
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:34.620]  means they still won't try to steal it, but it's a, Sarah Palin said there should be
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:39.420]  an uprising, basically. I didn't say that and accuse myself in stone of Roger Stone trying
[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:45.300]  to call for a war. We're going to win in the Info War, folks. We don't want it to go physical.
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:50.300]  Of course, if it does, we're going to win that too. But our guest is Larry Nichols,
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:55.100]  and Larry is having trouble speaking today. He is battling cancer and folks should pray
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:12:00.020]  for him and he has his oxygen tubes out right now. He had a tracheotomy last time he was
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:04.860]  on with us. So he's a tough old, old bird and we love him. And Larry, good to have you
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:09.380]  here with us, my friend. Hey man, how are you? How are you doing? I'm doing good, my friend.
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:18.540]  How are you doing? I'm here. I'm here. Listen, Alex, I'm here today because I've got to make
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:24.820]  an announcement. Then I get to let Trump have, then I get to let him have the nomination.
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:29.300]  Donald Trump has a move that he can make. I've tried every way I know how I know you
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:34.940]  have to get Trump in touch with me. It's not something I've made up. It's not something
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:38.780]  I hypothesize. Well, some of what we talk about does get to him. Some of what we talk about
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:44.340]  does get to him. I mean, I can tell you that. I understand. I understand what Donald Trump
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:49.340]  should do. And I mean, he should do it this weekend. He should hold a press conference
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:55.260]  and he should say, I'm not doing it for me. I'm doing it on behalf of the American people.
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:13:02.700]  I'm bringing my cadre of attorneys in. I'm paying for, and I'm filing theft by deception
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:10.460]  lawsuit against the RNC. Now, I know there'll be attorneys that say, oh, that's crazy. You
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:15.500]  can't sue the RNC. Well, I was told if you'll remember, Alex, I couldn't sue the president
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:22.180]  either with Paula Jones. And by God, I did. And by God, we got him under oath and he lied
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:29.740]  and we got him for perjury. That's what got him impeached. And he needs to say very clearly
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:35.540]  that the attorneys are hired. We're filing the lawsuit. It should be filed under criminal
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:40.700]  court. But we know Obama and the criminal people, they're not going to do that. So even
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:47.140]  that's filing civilly. And then Alex, within three weeks, he should make it known. Carl
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:58.780]  Roeve, Rich Priebus, Paul Ryan, et al., whoever else, Mitt Romney, that within three weeks,
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:04.540]  he plans to have his attorneys have them under deposition, under discovery.
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:08.540]  Well, Paul Manafort, who pretty much runs this campaign now and is coming on very soon,
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:14.220]  he went on to, you know, meet the press a week ago and said that they are looking, quote,
[01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:19.660]  at filing complaints and lawsuits. And I actually believe it's going in that direction, regardless
[01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:23.460]  just to point out, we're saying this is fraud. We're saying people should be allowed to vote
[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:24.460]  in America.
[01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:32.620]  Right. Well, this is, this is a technical point of law. I mean, number one, the RNC reached
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:38.140]  one bridge too far, Alex, when they went and had Louisiana, Colorado and a couple of other
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:44.500]  states prematurely go ahead and take delegate votes from Trump. Had they waited until one
[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:50.700]  week, six days before the convention, yeah, there'd been nothing anybody could do, Alex.
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:54.740]  The executive committee, rules committee could have had their meeting six days before the
[01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.300]  convention, fixed it to steal the thing.
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:15:00.940]  I totally agree with you. The way the rules are written, they could try some hanky-panky
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:06.340]  up around the convention, but the fact that they did it prematurely or just canceled caucuses
[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:08.700]  altogether is amazing.
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:15.180]  Well, and remember, Alex, to the people, y'all listen to me and Trump, listen to me, damn
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:22.460]  it, listen to me. There are people that have stood in line hours, hours to hear you speak.
[01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:28.540]  There have people that have gone through great difficulty to go out and vote for you. Now,
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:35.100]  these Republicans, executives, they have no intention of letting you have the nomination.
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:40.260]  I don't care if you go in. Alex, I've already told you there was an executive meeting where
[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:48.260]  they discussed. If he gets 1237 down to 1200, they're giving it to Kasek so they minimize
[01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:55.220]  the blowback. Look, guys, this stuff's been going on a long time. It has. But you see,
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:16:00.380]  when Trump got in the race, Alex, what changed this whole dynamic from years, years past?
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:06.940]  Normally, you remember, I told you this months and years ago, in primaries, see who has the
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:13.620]  most money always wins. So what the Republicans have always done to trick the elections, they
[01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:19.220]  get about 10 candidates to run in the beginning. They run all those guys off, they use up all
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:23.260]  their money, and then the only one left is the establishment candidate that has all the
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:29.660]  money in the world. In this case, it was supposed to be Bush. But here comes Trump. Trump don't
[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:36.700]  need their money. And all of those rules broke down. Now they're forced to go out in public
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:42.820]  and do it right in front of everybody's eyes. If he will do this, if he will do this, I
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:51.900]  assure him he will get the nominee nomination for the RNC. They can't stop him because what
[01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:58.660]  will happen, you know this, Alex, we get Carl Roevin, the boys in the box, under oath, and
[01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:03.540]  start asking them some questions like, golly, gee, did y'all get together and communicate
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:11.660]  with the Louisiana Executive Committee? Did y'all, by chance, talk to and conspire with
[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:19.620]  the Colorado RNC? Find out, make them say under oath what they did or did not do and
[01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:26.260]  if. And I'll say this to rinse previous and Carl Roevin, all you punkin' heads, listen
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:34.300]  to me. Everything Hillary Rodham Clinton has on every one of you. Some of you will put
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:40.180]  you in jail. All of you will make y'all feel ashamed of your name. Everything she's got,
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:47.220]  I got. And I swear to you, I will use it. I'm gonna use it. Now, the best thing everybody
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:51.980]  can do can zip this thing up. Trump can get his act together. I don't need him to bring
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:57.140]  in these pros from Dover, Alex. He can bring in that guy you're talking about and all these
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:03.380]  other guys that can count delegates and all the other. I know when the fix is in, I know
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:09.500]  how it works and I know what they're planning. They figured that even if they steal it from
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:16.340]  Trump, Hillary will get it. And then, you know what? They'll do what they've done before.
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:20.460]  Look, if you're a good Republican, do you want to vote for Hillary? Okay, yeah, you
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:25.820]  want to Trump. But the guy we got's not Hillary. And that's how they think this is gonna go.
[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:30.540]  Put him under oath, Alex. Well, I agree with you. That's a great plan. And I think so much
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:35.500]  is being looked at. Why are the Republicans so arrogant or is it desperateness to openly
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:40.220]  cancel elections in different states and like Trump wins all these states and suddenly we
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:44.580]  hear he's lost and Hillary's doing it to Sanders? Sounds like the two parties have
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:47.900]  gotten together at the top. We know they have against the Tea Party and have decided to
[01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:53.660]  just steal it together and to cover each other's backs. Alex, this is the last election we're
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:58.180]  going to have. Yeah, this is the last election. No, no, you were saying that a year ago. You
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:03.420]  were saying that a year ago. Yeah, look what's going on. You've got Biden and Obama and the
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:08.620]  head of the Federal Reserve meeting this week. Did you know it's a matter of national security?
[01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:14.780]  Those three are never to be in the same room away from the Capitol security that they were.
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:20.060]  One of the things they talked about, this was in Reuters. This isn't me saying it, Alex.
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:27.580]  It was in Reuters. They were discussing new martial law in case of a global meltdown.
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:34.620]  Then you've got the monetary fund, global monetary fund people meeting in New York. They're
[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:42.500]  coming in China, take and go back in the state of the world. Absolutely. They're not doing
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:47.220]  desperate stuff. I agree here in all the world for no reason. They know stuff's coming so big,
[01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:51.540]  we won't even remember all the stuff they're doing now. I'm telling you, folks, my spidey sense is
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:56.180]  pegging. I mean, it's like the RPMs are just off the chart. I can feel it. I can see it.

[01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:07.140]  become in these days of terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or even a future collapse?

[01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:06.020]  Hello, I'm Michael Reagan. My father, President Ronald Reagan, believes so strongly in gold
[01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:11.380]  that he changed gold ownership forever by bringing back physical gold to the American public,
[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:18.740]  allowing gold coins to be minted and sold to U.S. citizens just like you, starting in 1985. Gold
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:24.260]  ownership can help protect your financial future, especially when our national debt is spiraling
[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:29.540]  out of control. Many smart Americans have kept their retirements from being wiped out during
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:35.940]  America's financial crisis thanks to physical gold coins. I strongly urge you to call the U.S.

[01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:17.940]  could have violated state rules. Well, there they just even the few that wanted to vote who hadn't
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:22.980]  already been bought off were unable to because the ballots were just for the other guy. I mean,
[01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:26.660]  wow, they really are getting arrogant. You were getting into why you think this is all
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:33.780]  happening Larry Nichols. And it is in the news that even mainline mega banks, Royal Bank of
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:37.780]  Scotland, you name it says, sell everything you got, economic implosion coming, much of the
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:43.700]  world's already in a depression. Americans still aren't aware of it, but some days nothing's coming
[01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:48.820]  across the Atlantic or vice versa to the US. Shipping is coming to a halt, slowed down almost
[01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:54.660]  entirely from China. I mean, this is serious. What's the real state of the economy? Talking
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:59.700]  to your insiders, you said also there was more going on at Scalia than we knew, came out was a
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:07.380]  secret society. Those two issues, Larry Nichols. Well, number one, what's going on with the economy?
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:13.540]  If you'll notice the FDSC has put out a warning about the five major banks folks. Let me tell
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:20.260]  you, they use code words. Alex, there's a code word running around floating around called negative
[01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:26.100]  interest. Now guys, I know some of your thinking in the public, a lot of the public's thinking
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:32.340]  negative interest. Oh boy, that means our house payment will really go down. No, negative interest
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:39.780]  means are you listening to me? Negative interest means they're going to charge you interest to
[01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:45.380]  keep your money in the bank. And I got to pay you interest. By the way, that's already started
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:52.020]  in four countries in Europe. It's already begun. It means taxes on money transfers. Then they're
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:57.620]  going to nationalize and repatriate. That's what all this stuff is going on about the banks and
[01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:07.220]  the FDSC. One of our people inside with the FDSC is talking about, there's a group, a core, that
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:16.020]  is fighting the repatriation and nationalization of the banks under this financial meltdown.
[01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:21.300]  And they're going to use, of course, we've got to stop the downfall of the country. Now,
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:27.860]  what nationalization and repatriation means? And Alex, I've been in three countries, four, I guess,
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:35.540]  that collapsed. Two of my health. In those countries, what nationalization means,
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:39.620]  the government's going to come in and take over the bank. And they're going to make the mega banks
[01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:46.020]  foreign debt, our debt. It's not real nationalization. It's globalization. It's globalization, but
[01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:52.820]  now the repatriation part of the nationalization is that means folks are claiming all the money's
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:59.380]  theirs. Your money, your money belongs to them. They're going to take your money. If you don't get
[01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:05.540]  your money out of the bank now, excuse my dog, but if you don't get your money out of your bank now,
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:10.900]  there's going to be a day very, very soon that you're going to go down there and get it. And
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:15.780]  they're going to say, what money are you talking about? What money? You may think that you've got
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:22.020]  this bank that's local and it's not connected to this mega conglomerate. You're wrong. Your bank,
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:26.580]  right where you're at, is connected to these big global banks. It's all, they've done it. They've
[01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:33.620]  got it globalized. That's why Trump has to do what I'm saying. We've got to fight or this country's
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:39.220]  done. And if you don't believe me, look at what they're doing, Alex. They don't care that you
[01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:45.620]  know they're rigging the election. They don't care that the American people are figuring out,
[01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:52.820]  wait a minute, I thought I went to vote for a candidate for president. And now I find out
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:57.540]  what Nichols and Alex Jones and all these people been saying for years, my vote don't mean nothing.
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:29:03.300]  They're going to pick who they want. There's a reason they're doing it. It's because they know
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:08.020]  in the next few weeks, if we have that long, this thing's coming down.
[01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:13.140]  Well, no, no, you're going out on them here and you're a credible guy and I respect you,
[01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:16.820]  but you're saying the next few weeks, this is inevitable the next few years. You're saying
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:23.140]  the hammer fall is coming. It ain't going to take years and we're lucky. It might take months,
[01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:29.540]  but it had it. Look, Obama's sitting there. He's making his plans. You got Obama with his Islamic
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:35.060]  creeps wanting to take over our country. Larry, Larry, I'm going to have you back up sometime

[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:19.220]  The Congress has already explicitly protected firearm manufacturers from liability and the
[01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:24.260]  protection of Lawful Commerce and Arms Act, which says they will not be held liable for,
[01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:31.220]  quote, the harm caused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse firearm products or ammunition
[01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:36.500]  products that function as designed and intended. The act goes on to explain to people with an
[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:42.580]  anti-gun agenda like Judge Bellis that quote, the possibility of imposing liability on an entire
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:49.060]  industry for harm that is solely caused by others is an abuse of the legal system, unquote. What's
[01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:53.700]  next? Holding forward liable for a drunk driver killing someone with the car that they made?
[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:57.300]  If Hillary Clinton has her way, that's what they will do to gun manufacturers.

[01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:18.180]  Until Dawn. Right now, I got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:24.500]  The chair is against the wall. The chair is against the wall. John has a long mustache.
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:30.340]  John has a long mustache. It's 12 o'clock American, another day closer to victory. And for all of you
[01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:41.460]  out there on or behind the lines, this is your song. But they took a lot of people away. People
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:45.060]  that they thought were going to make trouble for them. People that had guns and things they wanted.
[01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:50.660]  They just took them away. Where? Re-education camps. That's what they call it. So part of it,
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:55.060]  we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids
[01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:59.780]  belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities. I have decided
[01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:09.460]  we really need camps for adults. And we need the type of camps that you all run. I mean, really.
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:14.420]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register. Now they were taken to racetracks
[01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:18.820]  and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers. Come on. I'm a
[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:24.260]  sorry citizen. I refuse to recognize you guys. What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see
[01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:28.260]  that happening? I mean, we've got a lot of constitution, a lot of people that it's not
[01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:32.420]  filed with. Plus, you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:40.100]  ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques. These people
[01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:45.300]  are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:50.020]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:35:01.140]  This whole thing is doing here unless not kid about it. We're building a domestic army
[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:05.460]  because the government is afraid of its own citizens. Put your gun down, really?
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:15.460]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones. Are you some kind of a
[01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:24.900]  constitutionalist? So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not. They're
[01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:31.300]  nothing more than domestic terrorists. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:47.780]  Thanks. We made that intro somewhat tongue in cheek, obviously, about a year ago with
[01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:52.260]  Hillary saying fun camps for men and we've actually got army manuals now that are talking
[01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:56.340]  about reeducation camps in America for political dissidents. This is what Obama's actually putting
[01:35:56.340 --> 01:36:00.660]  out and then we have Bill Nye, the science guy coming out and going, no, we need to look at arresting
[01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:05.940]  climate change deniers. And then he goes on because look at Enron. Well, Enron is what came
[01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:10.900]  up with a scam with Al Gore. I'm going to play that clip and then go to our guest. But everywhere
[01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:15.060]  these anti-Trump people are out there trying to beat people up. Our own crew in New York caught
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:21.300]  it three times on tape yesterday. They're in Denver today. They're going to be on the fourth hour,
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:25.460]  on the ground live with the demonstrations about to begin at the RNC where they just didn't have
[01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:31.620]  the caucuses and just gave it to Ted Cruz. And look, I've never been an enemy of Ted Cruz.
[01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:36.580]  I just don't like seeing things like that happen. And Hillary seconded him from Sanders in Louisiana.
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:44.660]  Trump won, but then Cruz got more delegates and now is the winner of the state. And Sarah
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:50.020]  Pellin came out in the US News World Report and said, voters should decide GOP nominee.
[01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:55.300]  That's surreal. Of course they should. Here's another one from CBS News saying the same thing.
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:37:00.740]  Why the GOP can't take the nomination from Donald Trump? Regardless, this is an attack
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:03.780]  on free speech. That's why I'm covering this. Let's play Bill Nye, the science guy,
[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:08.260]  Mark Moreno is on Earth Day next week, the fellow that did this interview,
[01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:12.580]  it's just a minute long, where he says, yeah, we should look at going after these people.
[01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:18.100]  The attorney generals in multiple states are talking about indicting climate change deniers.
[01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:23.460]  I mean, this is the attack on free speech folks. One step from the red dawn scenario,
[01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:27.940]  isn't it? With Hillary up there on the jumbo screen, going to the Senate candidate has a
[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:32.180]  good chance of winning in Louisiana, speaking of stone elections. And we'll be talking to him
[01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:35.860]  here in just a second. But first, here's Bill Nye, the science guy. We interviewed Robert F.
[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:40.820]  Kennedy, Jr., the environmentalist here at the People's Climate March in 2014, September.
[01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:46.980]  He said that the climate deniers his word and energy CEOs belong at the Hague with
[01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:51.380]  three square meals and a cot with all the other war criminals. What is your thought on that?
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:54.980]  Do you think some of the rhetoric on your side, as I'm sure both sides, but some of the rhetoric
[01:37:54.980 --> 01:37:59.460]  on your side gets too carried away? I mean, what's your thought on jailing skeptics as war criminals?
[01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:04.340]  We'll see what happens. Was it appropriate to jail the guys from Enron?
[01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:06.340]  Interesting.
[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:11.780]  Okay, right. So we'll see what happens. If was it appropriate to jail people from the cigarette
[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:17.780]  industry who insisted that this addictive product was not addictive and so on? And you think about,
[01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:25.460]  in these cases, for me as a taxpayer and voter, the doubting, the introduction of this extreme
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:31.860]  doubt, we go with extreme doubt, about climate change is affecting my quality of life as a public
[01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:37.780]  citizen. So I can see where people are very concerned about this and are pursuing criminal
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:48.500]  investigations as well as engaging in discussions like this. Enron, just type in Enron carbon
[01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:52.500]  tax, Enron global warming. I mean, they're the ones that wrote the treaties, everything with Al Gore
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:57.300]  and others. They were going to make the money. They got in trouble for fake energy trading.
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:02.820]  That's the scam. The cigarette people knew it was causing cancer and paid for fake science and
[01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:07.860]  admitted it. That's called fraud. It's not fraud to say, hey, the sun drives climate.
[01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:11.460]  And then they get the emails from these people, remember at the major university,
[01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:16.420]  coordinating over a thousand universities to, quote, hide the decline in global temperature
[01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:21.780]  records. That's all I'm saying. All right, going to our guests for the balance of the hour, Colonel
[01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:27.060]  Rob Maynish has an amazing background. Travelled from the Air Force four years ago for serving
[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:31.220]  his country, 32 years, including in combat. He commanded a B1 bomber squadron. Well,
[01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:36.420]  those are neat planes in Iraq and Afghanistan's wars. Commanded the sixth largest Air Force base
[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:40.020]  in the world and service and advisor to the joints. He's a staff following 9 11 attacks.
[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:47.380]  He helped author the plan for international war on terror, Colonel Maynish. Well, just so,
[01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:51.700]  so much other stuff he's done. I'll take you on to go over it. But Colonel Maynish is also
[01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:55.460]  responsible for authoring three pages in the nuclear black book. The travels ever with the
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:59.220]  president, his military awards and combat decorations include the Legion of Merit,
[01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:03.860]  the Bronze Star and the air metal. And it goes on. Rob completed his undergraduate work while
[01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:07.860]  attending night school at University of Tampa and holds three master's degrees from Harvard
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:13.060]  universities, Kennedy School and the Air Command and Staff College and the U.S. College of Naval
[01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:21.460]  Warfare, Rob Maynish.com. But it's spelled Manus. So it's Rob, M A N E S S dot com, Rob M A N
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:26.980]  E S S dot com. Colonel Rob Maynish joins us now via Skype. Thanks for coming on.
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:31.700]  Oh, thanks for having me on, Alex. And my mother, thanks you for reading that bio. We really
[01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:36.500]  appreciate it. Well, it's a great bio. Man, those are neat planes. They still haven't retired
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:40.260]  those yet. Have they with the whole swept wings and everything? No, they haven't retired them.
[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:47.220]  As a matter of fact, we had just brought them home and replaced them with B 52s in the air
[01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:52.740]  attacks on the Islamic state over in the Middle East. So the B ones could get some much needed
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:58.020]  upgrades. They've been carrying the workload for the air strikes against ISIS since the beginning
[01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:04.180]  of the, the, the bombing operations against them. I'll interview you sometime just about those. I
[01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:06.980]  mean, I've seen them for over an awesome, a fourth of July. It looks like a spaceship,
[01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:12.100]  even though it was made in the 80s. Oh yeah. Yeah, it's very fast. There's nothing like
[01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:17.860]  going supersonic speeds in an aircraft that's the same weight class as a DC 10. And those
[01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:22.740]  fly super low, but you can fly really low of those, right? Absolutely. The automatic train following
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:30.260]  system can take you down to 250 feet at approaching supersonic speeds. Do they all have the escape
[01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:36.500]  pod and stuff? No, they're air crews are in ejection seats in the B one bomber and didn't
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:40.900]  it previously have like an escape pod or something? The original design did have an escape pod on it.
[01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:44.660]  Yes, it did. Talk about, I'm sorry, let's, let's get into the campaign and why we need you in the
[01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:50.420]  US Senate. Well, you kind of hit on it in the intro and the videos, especially with this,
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:58.100]  this knife fellow. Look, Alex, I'm a, I'm just a normal red blooded American that cares about his
[01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:04.100]  country. And it's just tired to see in the Republic pulling down and, and we take an oath to the
[01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:09.060]  Constitution of the United States. And I'm disappointed in men like General Wesley Clark who,
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:13.540]  who say that, that folks that care about the Constitution aren't loyal to the United States.
[01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:19.620]  He's, he's lost track of what we are about. What we are about in this country is about
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:24.820]  the natural rights that every human being has and the limited government that the Constitution is
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:32.020]  supposed to construct for us that gives everybody the ability to hold themselves and their children
[01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:38.820]  accountable to be fiscally responsible and ensures equality of opportunity for all of us,
[01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:45.140]  regardless of where, how we were born or where we came from. And Mr. Clark, unfortunately,
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:48.980]  seems to think that we owe allegiance to the government of the United States. Well, that's
[01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:53.460]  just not true. We owe it to the Constitution of the United States and the government that's
[01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:59.140]  currently in place in the United States of America has completely outgrown the Constitution of the
[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:04.260]  United States. And I'm running for the United States Senate because I believe in those four
[01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:09.060]  things that I just told you and we've got to get our country back into a constitutional form of
[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:12.580]  government. Tell us about the policies, what you would do if you get in the U.S. Senate. And
[01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:17.300]  obviously I'm supporting over the people you're running against. I mean, how do we help get you
[01:43:17.300 --> 01:43:21.460]  in there? Because I know that we've got a good shot at it. Well, first of all, it's foreign policy.
[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:27.220]  You know, look, at 32 years in the Air Force, I graduated from the Harvard University Kennedy
[01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:30.900]  School of Government. I studied international security and foreign policy there along with
[01:43:30.900 --> 01:43:36.900]  domestic politics. I'm a graduate of the U.S. Navy War College and National Strategy. And
[01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:43.540]  I believe in the Constitution. I'm a constitutionalist. I believe in pro-America foreign policy,
[01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:49.300]  not pro-UN foreign policy. That's just absolutely crazy. We've got to protect America's
[01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:56.020]  citizens and vital national interests before we do anything else. We've got to do things like,
[01:43:56.020 --> 01:44:03.220]  insist that Congress executes its appropriate role in foreign policy and declaring war and
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:08.420]  those kind of things. And I don't believe in going into every little dictatorship and toppling
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:13.380]  those guys and creating chaos around the world. We've done that way too much. And we don't want
[01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:19.700]  to sacrifice our children's lives unnecessarily, the ones that volunteer to defend this country.
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:24.340]  And I have three sons in the United States military. My youngest one that's in is an
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:29.140]  airman and he's on his way back today to the United Kingdom where we just rolled up some more
[01:44:29.140 --> 01:44:34.260]  terrorists, including the one at the airport just down the road from where he'll be landing tonight
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:40.180]  or in the morning. So we've got a lot of stake here in this country with our kids putting their
[01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:45.300]  lives on the line for us, just like I did for 32 years and my dad did. So we've got to make sure
[01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:50.260]  that we're not out there toppling dictators and getting involved unnecessarily in these countries
[01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:53.140]  and protecting America's interests. Sure. What do you think, Colonel?
[01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:56.980]  The Americans interest. What do you think? Again, Senate candidate Colonel Rob Manus joining us
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:45:01.940]  robmanus.com. What do you think Obama's thinking when they bring in hundreds of thousands,
[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:06.580]  it's hundreds of thousands, millions into Europe, most 80% or military age men,
[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:10.180]  they're already doing sleeper attacks. A lot of experts believe they're planning a jihad
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:14.660]  Tet offensive in Europe. What's going to happen when thousands, conservatively,
[01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:20.260]  that's what most experts agree, at least 10,000 just operate and start killing everybody and
[01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:24.420]  blowing stuff up and attacking nuclear plants. They're already having guards getting killed,
[01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:29.220]  disappearing. What's going to happen to the government when this happens and they brought
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:33.860]  them in? Are they so dumb that they think we won't, that they won't get in trouble? I mean,
[01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:39.460]  I'm just wondering, why would the socialists like Merkel and Hollande and Obama want to be doing this?
[01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:44.980]  I mean, why do they ally themselves with radical jihadis? We know they were backing them before
[01:45:44.980 --> 01:45:49.460]  in Syria. The military said no to it and the people said no. So now they've been forced to
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:54.020]  counter Islamic State. I mean, what's going on where the Russians start to look more like the
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:57.940]  good guys? And I'm not defending what the Russians do. They have a lot of problems. But that's how
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:03.940]  bad Obama is in my view. Well, we've got to remember that his goal is to transform the United States
[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:09.860]  of America. And I truly believe that he believes in his heart of hearts that American foreign policy
[01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:16.260]  and the foreign policy of Western Europe is the evil has contributed and caused all of the evils
[01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:21.060]  of the world, which is absolutely not true. Look, we're weaker than we've ever been. We no longer
[01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:27.860]  lead and the world's on fire. We need to stay strong and we need to lead in the world. But
[01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:33.620]  that doesn't mean that we need to go putting our kid and military forces into all these countries
[01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:38.180]  and intervening where it's not appropriate because our interests aren't at stake. We've got to make
[01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:43.540]  sure we're defending America's interests first. Look, your question reminds me of the border
[01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:48.340]  situation in our own country. And you kind of touched on... The Border Patrol admits that they
[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:52.820]  quote, complete the smuggling process. Our own reporters two years ago, Jakari Jackson and Don
[01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:59.860]  Salazar, went down the border, Colonel. And the Border Patrol admitted, we're ordered to bring
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:04.020]  the illegals in and give them vouchers and complete the smuggling process. I mean, just backing you
[01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:08.340]  up. How do they search me when I fly in, you know, from Europe, search my bags, but then
[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:16.580]  illegals just walk in. My son flew home on leave from the United Kingdom a month ago on the same
[01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:22.180]  day that the Brussels attacks occurred. And he was on an American Airlines flight. And before he
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:29.460]  even got through security, he had to answer 32 specific questions to just to board the flight
[01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:34.500]  to the United States of America. So we've got a problem. And part of the problem is that we have
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:38.740]  folks that are in office right now leading this country. And it doesn't really matter what letters
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:45.300]  behind their name. You know that, Alex. And that's why, you know, our presidential candidates on
[01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:50.420]  the GOP side are so popular, the two front runners ours, because they believe in Americanism.
[01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:58.020]  We believe in Americanism, our sovereignty, our sovereignty. It's simple. We must respect our
[01:47:58.020 --> 01:48:03.300]  own laws. That's all we ask for is that other people respect our laws. And we've got to do two
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:08.420]  things when it comes to things like internal security and immigration control, we've got to do
[01:48:08.420 --> 01:48:13.380]  two things is all we've got to do to get things on the right track. And that is secure our border,
[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:21.620]  secure our darn border, and get ourselves to to bake ourselves and force our current law.
[01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:27.940]  Our current law is not being enforced. And if we enforce current law, just on the Mexican side and
[01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:33.060]  the Central American side alone, the illegals that are in this country, there's pupe holing out
[01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:38.100]  there, that data out there that shows that even it was taken during the Obama administration,
[01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:44.500]  but even during his administration, upwards of 1.2 million people would go back to their homes in
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:50.260]  Central, South America and Mexico a year if we would just enforce our current law. I mean,
[01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:55.220]  my goodness, what's wrong with respecting American law? It is the law of the land, this thing we
[01:48:55.220 --> 01:48:59.220]  call the Constitution of the United States. What do you think the president is just thinking,
[01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:05.460]  Colonel, when the border is basically wide open, and then there will be more terror attacks,
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:10.180]  they ordered the FBI, as you know, to say San Bernardino wasn't, but two days later it came
[01:49:10.180 --> 01:49:14.420]  out it was, and the FBI leaked that they were ordered to say it wasn't. There's got to be a
[01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:18.500]  major disconnect there. I mean, why would the president want to let us be attacked?
[01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:24.980]  There's no disconnect. And I don't believe that it's that he wants us wants to let us be attacked,
[01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:30.580]  per se, is that he doesn't believe that we're going to be attacked. In spite of all of the series of
[01:49:30.580 --> 01:49:35.940]  attacks under this man's watch of terrorist attacks from Islamic jihadists and extremists,
[01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:43.060]  from Boston to Chattanooga to Fort Hood to San Bernardino, all of those attacks. And the man
[01:49:43.060 --> 01:49:48.340]  just still looks the camera in the eye and the American people in the eye and says,
[01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:52.500]  I don't believe that we're under attack. These are all own wolves. And that's the spin that he's
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:57.780]  trying to put on it. And quite frankly, he has the mainstream media on his side, and he knows that
[01:49:57.780 --> 01:50:03.940]  he can keep the American people asleep in large numbers. And he was successful, Colonel, as you
[01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:08.020]  know, when it came to the shootings at the Army Navy Marine Corps centers, they would just cover
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:12.580]  those up or the cops getting shot with the people yelling, oh, Akbar, they say it's not
[01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:16.340]  terror related. You never hear about it again, or the nightclub getting attacked in Canada. It's
[01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:23.140]  happening all the time. It happens all the time. And while the fatality numbers are low,
[01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:28.100]  and he likes to use the numbers of more people are killed in such and such a
[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:34.100]  deal or have been killed in such and such deals, whatever it is, you pick the vehicle that he
[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:40.820]  uses as opposed to those killed by terrorism since 9 11. But that's not the point. The point is,
[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:46.260]  this is the United States of America. Men and women like me have risked their lives and given
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:50.900]  their lives and their bodies to protect the United States of America and the American people.
[01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:56.020]  And I've served for 32 and a half years doing that supporting the Constitution. And now I have
[01:50:56.020 --> 01:51:01.540]  to live with the fact that my 11 year old and my wife don't feel secure in their own homes. But
[01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:07.780]  because of these Islamic jihadist terrorism, because men like Barack Obama insist on not even calling
[01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:13.140]  the enemy what it is. Well, we know things in the military. We learn how to conduct wars and plan
[01:51:13.140 --> 01:51:17.860]  for wars. And you've got to do some simple things. It's not complicated. You first have to identify
[01:51:17.860 --> 01:51:23.860]  the enemy and it's Islamic jihadism and extremism. That's what it is. Then you have to find the enemy.
[01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:28.260]  And we know where most of them are throughout the Middle East and North and Middle Africa now.
[01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:33.300]  And a lot of them are in Europe, as you just pointed out, Alex. And we know that. So let's
[01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:37.460]  start rolling them up. Let's find them. And then the next two steps are the hardest ones,
[01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:42.660]  because we got to have political will and courage to do that. And that is you target them,
[01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:48.020]  and you kill them all as rapidly as possible. That's the only thing that removes a threat,
[01:51:48.020 --> 01:51:52.900]  a growing threat like this does to the United States. Well, absolutely. I want to know why
[01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:58.100]  the New York Daily News reports, CBS reports, they have planes all the time at JFK coming in
[01:51:58.100 --> 01:52:02.820]  from overseas and they don't even check their passports or IDs because, quote, you know,
[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:07.940]  the government tells them, let them in. And so I'm going to get searched. The TSA is there.
[01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:12.580]  It's all theater. My rights are being violated. It'd be one thing if they were actually stopping
[01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:16.500]  these people and then searching me. But no, they're searching me and my family. But then
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:21.860]  letting the obvious groups in, I mean, what's the equation there? I guess just train me how to
[01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:25.380]  train the public how to be a slave. Then there's more terror attacks. They take more of my rights,
[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:32.420]  Colonel. It's political correctness. Political correctness is going to be the end of this country
[01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:38.580]  and the end of freedom for mankind. If we don't get our arms wrapped around it. That's why we
[01:52:38.580 --> 01:52:43.540]  have folks doing so well that insist on not using political correctness. Look, we've got to call the
[01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:49.060]  enemy what it is, identify what needs to be done and then get the job done. And we've got to stop
[01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:55.140]  doing stupid stuff like in Louisiana here, activists are fighting the real ID for the fifth
[01:52:55.140 --> 01:53:00.420]  year in a row so that the federal government doesn't get to have an entire database on all of the
[01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:05.700]  citizens of Louisiana except for the criminals because they won't go participate in that.
[01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:09.460]  It's the same thing with gun control. You know, I'm a huge Second Amendment advocate.
[01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:13.380]  My family military service goes all the way back to the American Revolution
[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:18.100]  and the right to keep and bear arms is the foundation and the insurance policy for the
[01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:23.220]  freedom of all Americans and the insurance policy to protect the Constitution of the United States.
[01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:29.300]  And we will do that just as your intro video showed. When pushed, we will get that job done.
[01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:34.260]  And you know what? The president of the United States needs to repeal the order that keeps
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:38.580]  commanders from arming their men and women on military bases today.
[01:53:38.580 --> 01:53:44.500]  Every man and woman that's in a uniform on duty should be armed with at least a sidearm today,
[01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:50.820]  whether you're in the United States or overseas. My son is stationed at a military base in Europe
[01:53:50.820 --> 01:53:57.380]  that just had a jihadi convicted of attempting to drive through the fence and grab the first
[01:53:57.380 --> 01:54:02.420]  military person that they could see and cut their throat while on video. And that's the
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:07.220]  kind of thing that's happening to our American men and women and it's being planned against
[01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:12.820]  these soft targets. And they wouldn't even say Major Hassan for four years was a jihadi,
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:17.860]  remember that? Oh, absolutely. It's the most ridiculous thing that I've ever seen. I was
[01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:23.220]  still in the military then. I couldn't really speak up and say anything, but I'm going to tell you
[01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:29.380]  now that was the dumbest move this president has ever made. And he needs to be leaving office
[01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:35.220]  very quietly with his head hanging in shame for what he's done to the survivors and the wounded
[01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:41.540]  from the Fort Hood massacre in Islamic jihadists. Colonel Rob Menace, we only got about a minute
[01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:46.340]  or two left. People need to go to robmanace.com to support your campaign and you're doing well.
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:49.620]  And I just hope you get into the U.S. Senate separately. I know you've got a lot of great
[01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:55.140]  ideas on cutting taxes, a lot of other things that folks can find out about there on the site.
[01:54:55.140 --> 01:55:00.420]  You can find out how to volunteer. You've got a store with, you know, some of the apparel and stuff
[01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:04.900]  for folks who want to help spread the word. But I tell you, I just want to restore sovereignty.
[01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:10.020]  I just want to restore, you know, this nation's basic integrity. We are having an attempt to
[01:55:10.020 --> 01:55:13.700]  a leftist takeover in this country and I'm a libertarian. I'm not even so-called conservative.
[01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:17.780]  I'm just a patriot. And these people really think it's their time. They've uncloaked.
[01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:22.580]  They're showing themselves to really be aggressive. And we need a total landslide against these
[01:55:22.580 --> 01:55:25.540]  people. And we need establishment Republicans removed from office as well.
[01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:31.860]  Absolutely, Alex. I appreciate you having me on. You can find us at robmanace on Twitter also.
[01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:36.660]  Thanks for showing the website at robmanace.com. And you know what? We've got to stop doing these
[01:55:36.660 --> 01:55:42.340]  dumb things in our government. Like the 9-11 report, the 28 pages. Let's get that public. We've got
[01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:46.900]  to know who the enemy is. We've got to do that. We've got to do things like audit the Fed and
[01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:50.260]  those kinds of things. Well, that's awesome. I mean, you've got a lot of great policies. That's
[01:55:50.260 --> 01:55:53.380]  why we're supporting you. Colonel, God bless. Look forward to speaking to you when you're in
[01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:57.540]  the U.S. Senator before then. God bless you, Alex. Thanks a lot. You bet. What a great guy.
[01:55:57.540 --> 01:56:01.460]  We need people like that in the U.S. Senate and all these lawyers and all these establishment people,
[01:56:01.460 --> 01:56:06.020]  I tell you, who have set up a world government basically and they want to just fold us into
[01:56:06.020 --> 01:56:10.980]  it now and kind of graduate to that higher level of control. And it's time that that's stopped.
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:15.780]  I want nationalists and I want them now. And I don't want them to bring the jihadis in and let
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:20.580]  them attack us to turn us into a police state. I mean, you want to grab my testicles that even
[01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:26.180]  goes with the scanner or whatever. I'm dying. The border is basically open. Leave me alone.
[01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:30.900]  And I'm not mad at the TSA themselves. It's the Congress. It's the government.
[01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:39.380]  I realize blaming the TSA, we need to blame the law and the feds. It's a joke. Okay.
[01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:44.980]  Briefly, folks, we need your support now more than ever with our crew out there on the street,
[01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:48.420]  24 seven, basically, and our reporters and Bilderberg coming up and everything else.

[01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:08.340]  off brain force, the ultimate brain boosting, healthy, and utropic out there. I mean, comparable
[01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:13.380]  stuff's like 60 bucks a bottle. That's because they market up five to six times. I don't do that.
[01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:17.220]  Maybe I should that I don't have to plug all the time, but it's 25% off the already discounted
[01:57:17.220 --> 01:57:23.700]  price. 45% off normal retail for a limited time. Info wars store.com is the umbrella site.

[01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:58.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:07.380 --> 02:00:13.220]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:17.140]  Bring in the hag.
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:24.660]  Now, go on to legend. As we all will.
[02:00:26.260 --> 02:00:33.380]  And join our ancestors. I don't want to join my ancestors. I don't want to die.
[02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:43.540]  I tell you, I'm comfortable with it. He only did what he had to do.
[02:00:44.900 --> 02:00:51.860]  And now he's grown old. I know what goes forward though. It's the human species.
[02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:59.780]  There's really no restraint now on the genetic engineers on the elite with the weapons they're
[02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:04.340]  building. There's only lust for raw power.
[02:01:10.580 --> 02:01:18.260]  I hope we can survive our collective madness.
[02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:24.660]  I hope that we can survive the mad scientist.
[02:01:24.660 --> 02:01:33.220]  Hell, asteroids and superquakes and things like that are a big enough issue to deal with.
[02:01:33.220 --> 02:01:37.540]  I'm going to talk about that some later. California is just due for megacwakes. It's
[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:43.940]  like two years overdue. The entire rest of the Pacific Rim has had a big quake in the last decade
[02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:48.900]  and when it hits, they think it's going to be super devastating. I'm not trying to be negative
[02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:53.780]  here. I'm just talking about how we just don't expect things till they hit us. We have a 7.4
[02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:58.020]  earthquake hit southern Japan. We've got volcanoes going crazy all over the place.
[02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:05.620]  The inner areas of the earth are definitely active and imagine if they came out and said,
[02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:11.060]  if you don't believe that man is causing the earthquakes or man's causing the
[02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:14.900]  molten lava to be more active, we're going to put you in jail. Like Bill Nye says,
[02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:19.940]  we should look at doing if you don't believe in manmade global warming or now climate
[02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:24.580]  changer. Whatever else they tell you, the science is fixed on when it's not. I mean, most scientists,
[02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:30.180]  astrophysicists and solar experts and others, they're just there like, no, it's the sun.
[02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:35.140]  But the UN had a vote five years ago and they said the sun has no effect on climate.
[02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:41.700]  It's like saying your water heater has no effect on the hot water that you have in your bathtub.
[02:02:41.700 --> 02:02:50.420]  I mean, it's the reason the water's hot. It's ridiculous. And they knew the sun started cooling
[02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:54.340]  down. The earth started getting cooler. The sun is in a more dormant phase.
[02:02:58.420 --> 02:03:04.900]  And they know that. And he goes, but Enron ran scams. They went to jail. Enron lied to people
[02:03:04.900 --> 02:03:09.700]  about how much the power was costing. And then Enron was the one that came up with the carbon
[02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:18.900]  tax. I just cannot believe the rich irony, the rich hypocrisy. It's not even hypocrisy. What is the
[02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:25.060]  word? Does Bill Nye not know that Enron came up with a whole scam or that the whole thing's about that?
[02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:29.860]  They've invested so much, they will not stop.
[02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:36.260]  And I never finished this clip. I want to finish it now. This is Barbara Boxer attacking first
[02:03:36.260 --> 02:03:41.220]  a philosopher. She says, I don't listen to philosophers. Then she goes to text Catholic
[02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:45.460]  priests. She doesn't agree with the Pope, who isn't a scientist either. But we can all look at the
[02:03:45.460 --> 02:03:49.140]  evidence and know that a carbon tax is a death sentence. That's what they're saying. Here it is.
[02:03:49.860 --> 02:03:54.980]  This is one of the greatest moral crimes. If you make energy more expensive or you prohibit or
[02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:59.620]  restrict people from getting energy from sources like coal, that's literally death.
[02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:02.340]  Mr. Epstein, are you a scientist?
[02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:10.500]  No, philosopher. You're a philosopher. Yes. Okay. Well, this is the Environment and Public
[02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:14.580]  Works Committee. I think it's interesting we have a philosopher here talking about an issue.
[02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:17.940]  It's to teach you how to think more clearly. Well, you don't have to teach me how to think
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:24.500]  more clearly. You don't have to try running for the Senate on your platform. Reverend Nelson,
[02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:29.780]  perhaps the most, well, this is the place to have a philosopher, not a scientist. It's perfect for
[02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:35.060]  this Republican... You have to integrate the big picture data. I'm not asking you anything. I'm
[02:04:35.060 --> 02:04:41.380]  telling you that all you have to know is you're a philosopher, not a scientist, and I don't appreciate
[02:04:41.380 --> 02:04:47.380]  getting lectured by a philosopher about science. Now, I want to talk to... I can't ask you what I
[02:04:47.380 --> 02:04:52.180]  want. Do you disagree with the Pope on climate change? It's as simple as yes or no. When the
[02:04:52.180 --> 02:04:59.940]  Pope says things that have to do with science, he does not speak from the... We'll be back. Stay with us.
[02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:05.460]  A seismologist warns that catastrophic mega earthquakes are on their way after five major
[02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:10.900]  earthquakes took place in the last 48 hours. Seismologist Roger Bilham of the University of
[02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:15.940]  Colorado has made headlines all over the world by warning that current conditions might trigger
[02:05:15.940 --> 02:05:21.060]  at least four earthquakes greater than 8.0 in magnitude. If his projections are accurate,
[02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:25.540]  our planet could be on the precipice of a wave of natural disasters unlike anything that any
[02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:30.500]  of us have witnessed before. A single magnitude 8.0 earthquake in a populated area would be a
[02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:35.860]  disaster of historic proportions, but four of them, that would be a complete and utter nightmare.
[02:05:35.860 --> 02:05:41.620]  And according to Volcano Discovery, 38 volcanoes around the globe are erupting right now. Michael
[02:05:41.620 --> 02:05:47.140]  Snyder asks, why is this happening? Why is the crust of the earth shaking so violently all of a
[02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:51.700]  sudden? In Matthew 24, Jesus warned us that there would be earthquakes in diverse places
[02:05:51.700 --> 02:05:56.980]  just prior to his return. Are we truly in the times that the Bible refers to as the last days?
[02:05:56.980 --> 02:06:03.220]  Read more right now at infowars.com. More than two years ago, info wars first told you about our
[02:06:03.220 --> 02:06:07.860]  research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists
[02:06:07.860 --> 02:06:13.460]  have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly
[02:06:13.460 --> 02:06:18.500]  started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family,
[02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:23.940]  into the water. They took the good halogen-L and put the deadly halogen in. And when the Fukushima
[02:06:23.940 --> 02:06:28.980]  crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself
[02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:35.220]  and your family. Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection
[02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:41.380]  between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[02:06:41.380 --> 02:06:45.860]  ever concerning iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is the real deal,
[02:06:45.860 --> 02:06:51.060]  folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:30.980]  He was on the air three weeks ago with Mr. Dent, Peter Schiff, and I wanted to have a nice
[02:08:30.980 --> 02:08:37.540]  discussion. It got a little bit heated, especially on Dent's side. I didn't know that guy could get
[02:08:37.540 --> 02:08:42.420]  excited, but it was definitely very thought-provoking because I wanted to get Peter Schiff on with him,
[02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:45.460]  because I think both guys are really smart and I wanted to see where they think things are going.
[02:08:46.820 --> 02:08:51.300]  Boy, Peter has been saying that he thinks the IMF would basically, and World Bank would call,
[02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:55.860]  for a further race of negative interest rates. For folks that don't know what that means,
[02:08:55.860 --> 02:09:01.300]  we're going to break it down. We don't get lower interest rates. No, no, no. It means the banks
[02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:05.380]  start charging us basically to keep money. That's already started in a few areas of Europe,
[02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:10.020]  and if you want to know where we're going, look at Europe because the bail-ins, just all the
[02:09:10.020 --> 02:09:15.460]  craziness, and they are gearing up here. They're admitting the economies in trouble, the Federal
[02:09:15.460 --> 02:09:19.700]  Reserve admits it's in trouble. When Schiff predicted they would just go up a small amount,
[02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:22.980]  he said then they might even go back up to that. They're not talking about it.
[02:09:23.540 --> 02:09:27.780]  So we're going to find out what he thinks is going on. He's one of the best people to talk to,
[02:09:27.780 --> 02:09:31.380]  because you're never sure. The establishment isn't kind of sure. They're kind of waiting
[02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:35.140]  to the last minute as well. We've seen the main New York fed say they're out of bullets,
[02:09:36.340 --> 02:09:38.900]  term shift used a couple of years ago. They just don't have anything to do.
[02:09:39.540 --> 02:09:43.860]  Some of people go, well, I'm not the stock market. I don't care. Everything's connected to this,
[02:09:43.860 --> 02:09:49.700]  folks. So we're on top of this giant bubble, and they're saying Trump is gloom and doom because he
[02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:54.260]  goes, we're in trouble. We're in a big bubble. They go, oh, look at Trump, that's firm hunger.
[02:09:54.260 --> 02:09:59.060]  I mean, we're on the biggest bubble ever. So EuroPak.com, billions under management. I'm not
[02:09:59.060 --> 02:10:04.260]  going to go into Peter Schiff's whole background. Most folks know who he is by selling a researcher
[02:10:04.260 --> 02:10:08.580]  and author and radio host in his own right. EuroPak.com. I'm Alex Jones, of course,
[02:10:08.580 --> 02:10:14.740]  within FullWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com. He'll be gone at the bottom of the hour, and then I'm
[02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:19.700]  going to spend 30 minutes on news. There's a bunch of it. Military news, Russians, buzzing ships,
[02:10:19.700 --> 02:10:24.420]  our stories on DrudgeReport.com. There's just a lot of it. I'm going to get to it. In the fourth hour,
[02:10:24.420 --> 02:10:29.060]  our crew in Denver, where people are protesting, the RNC just canceling the election there.
[02:10:29.540 --> 02:10:33.540]  They tried to act like this was normal in like a con game, and now everybody's waking up to it.
[02:10:33.540 --> 02:10:38.340]  And even a lot of mainland Republicans are saying it's wrong. So we're going to get into that as
[02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:43.540]  well. Peter Schiff has a two second delay. So I'm going to try to not jump in too much. The skype
[02:10:43.540 --> 02:10:47.780]  is acting weird today. So we're going to go to Peter Schiff right now. Again, if you're a radio
[02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:52.980]  listener, infowars.com forward slash show, you can always add another dimension. Most of you
[02:10:52.980 --> 02:10:57.860]  listen at lunch or in your car. I get that. But when you're at home or want to add another level
[02:10:57.860 --> 02:11:03.220]  to it, infowars.com forward slash show, you're also going on on TV satellites, have some TV and
[02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:06.820]  cable systems like in Houston, picking this up. We're about to roll that a lot bigger in the
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:10.580]  next few months and start listing a bunch of affiliates, really exciting things on that front
[02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:16.500]  as well. But again, go into Peter Schiff of EuroPAC.com. Peter, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:11:17.300 --> 02:11:21.060]  Oh, thanks for having me back on, Alex. Where do we start? I mean,
[02:11:22.260 --> 02:11:26.420]  are we 30 seconds from midnight? I mean, how bad is it? What's really going on in the economy?
[02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:33.060]  Well, it's no way to know exactly, you know, the timetable, but obviously this economy is already
[02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:39.060]  back in recession. And if it's not in a recession, it's certainly on the cusp of one. But, you know,
[02:11:39.060 --> 02:11:43.620]  if you look at the data that came out, we got industrial production numbers that came out
[02:11:43.620 --> 02:11:48.180]  earlier this morning. They were looking for a bounce instead. We got another decline.
[02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:54.500]  They revised the February number down. We got big inventories billed again this week.
[02:11:54.500 --> 02:12:02.980]  Retail sales disappointed. I think it's clear that we could be in a negative GEP quarter right now
[02:12:02.980 --> 02:12:09.140]  and, you know, I think that if the first quarter is bad, this second quarter is going to be worse
[02:12:09.140 --> 02:12:13.620]  because the last couple of years we had a rebound in the second quarter because we had very cold
[02:12:13.620 --> 02:12:19.700]  winters. Well, this winter was the warmest in 120 years. So there is nothing to rebound from.
[02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:24.340]  If anything, some of the activity might have been pulled into the first quarter from the second.
[02:12:24.340 --> 02:12:29.940]  Meanwhile, you've got this huge inventory glut that needs to be wound down and the trade deficit
[02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:35.220]  is getting worse. So there's a lot bearing down on U.S. economic growth. The problem for the Fed
[02:12:35.220 --> 02:12:41.380]  is how do they launch a new round of stimulus and still pretend the economy is in good shape?
[02:12:41.380 --> 02:12:46.260]  Because that's the message President Obama is trying to sell. And that's the message that
[02:12:46.260 --> 02:12:50.180]  Hillary Clinton is trying to run on. And Janet Yellen doesn't want to take the wind out of their
[02:12:50.180 --> 02:12:59.620]  sales. What does it signify? Was my analysis accurate or what can you add of what negative
[02:12:59.620 --> 02:13:02.100]  interest rates will do? And then what do you predict they're going to do?
[02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:07.140]  Well, I mean, negative interest rates are a disaster. I mean, it's not working in Japan.
[02:13:07.140 --> 02:13:11.460]  It's not working in Europe. It's not going to work here. But just because it doesn't work
[02:13:11.460 --> 02:13:15.620]  doesn't mean we're not going to do it because everything we do doesn't work and we do it anyway.
[02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:20.340]  But I think it shows desperation that you've had all these central bankers lowering interest
[02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:25.300]  rates and lowering interest rates and expecting it to revive the economy. And then when they get
[02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:30.340]  down to zero, rather than admit that it didn't work, because clearly if you go to zero and you
[02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:34.900]  still haven't achieved your objective, maybe it doesn't work. Instead of admitting that they were
[02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:42.020]  wrong, they're now going negative, which is just sheer desperation. But I do believe as inflation
[02:13:42.020 --> 02:13:46.820]  really starts to turn around in Europe and Japan, the central banks, they're going to be forced to
[02:13:46.820 --> 02:13:51.620]  abandon 0% rates. And they're actually going to have to raise rates pretty high to get out in
[02:13:51.620 --> 02:13:56.100]  front of that inflation curve. But the United States, I don't think we're going to do anything.
[02:13:56.100 --> 02:14:01.620]  No matter how high inflation gets, we'll do our best to pretend it doesn't exist or rationalize it
[02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:06.740]  away because we have a lot more debt. I mean, America is broke. If you look at Europe and
[02:14:06.740 --> 02:14:11.620]  Japan, even though there is some debt there, overall, those are still creditor nations. The
[02:14:11.620 --> 02:14:16.180]  world still owes Europe money. The world owes Japan money. But America owes more money than
[02:14:16.180 --> 02:14:20.660]  all the other debtor nations combined. I mean, Trump is right about that. I mean, we are broke.
[02:14:20.660 --> 02:14:25.700]  We're flat broke and we're living off this credit bubble and we can't prick it. So other
[02:14:25.700 --> 02:14:29.140]  central banks may be able to raise their rates, but the Fed can't.
[02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:36.500]  How do you see this unfolding? I mean, what are the next triggers? We hear about sovereign debt.
[02:14:36.500 --> 02:14:40.500]  We hear about corporate debt. We hear about state debt. I mean, what could trigger the next big
[02:14:40.500 --> 02:14:44.900]  implosion, a huge earthquake in California? I mean, I guess another subprime mortgage crisis
[02:14:44.900 --> 02:14:50.340]  they're talking about is coming soon. I mean, there's so many irons in the fire that I see as
[02:14:50.340 --> 02:14:55.700]  being able to be a trigger or does it just keep sliding slowly because even mainline media now
[02:14:55.700 --> 02:15:00.100]  won't push the lie that they were just a year ago that really the economy is doing fantastic.
[02:15:00.100 --> 02:15:03.620]  The only person doing that is Obama who says we have the best economy ever, ever.
[02:15:03.620 --> 02:15:08.100]  Yeah. Yeah. Meanwhile, you know, we got some consumer sentiment numbers come out today,
[02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:13.380]  much worse than expected. Small business sentiment came out the lowest in two years.
[02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:18.820]  That was earlier this week. And in fact, small business owners listed the weak US economy
[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:25.860]  as their main concern. I mean, so if businesses are so concerned about the economy,
[02:15:25.860 --> 02:15:30.740]  how can it be so great if you've got Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders doing so well?
[02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:36.260]  Sanders is now almost neck and neck with Clinton in the national polls. He's only down by like
[02:15:36.260 --> 02:15:40.420]  one or two points. And I think Trump came out today. This is his biggest lead yet
[02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:45.140]  in the national polls. I mean, why is that? These are the two candidates that are the ones
[02:15:45.140 --> 02:15:50.180]  that are most running as anti-establishment. The economy is a wreck and I can do something
[02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:56.020]  to fix it. If the economy was so good, these candidates wouldn't be attracting so much support.
[02:15:56.020 --> 02:16:01.140]  So, you know, you write the economy is bad. It's just a question of people admitting it.
[02:16:01.140 --> 02:16:05.700]  And I think the trigger, the trigger that's going to really send this into a higher gear
[02:16:05.700 --> 02:16:11.300]  is going to be the admission by the Fed that the economy is weak or the market's figuring it out
[02:16:11.300 --> 02:16:17.060]  on their own. And then you really get a decline in the dollar because now people start to realize
[02:16:17.060 --> 02:16:20.020]  that we're not going to get all these rate hikes that everybody's been betting on.
[02:16:20.020 --> 02:16:24.500]  We're going to get cuts and the Fed doesn't have much room to cut because it only managed to raise
[02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:28.820]  rates to a quarter. So there's not a lot of stimulus left. All they've got is potentially
[02:16:28.820 --> 02:16:32.980]  negative rates and a huge round of quantitative easing. And this thing is going to blow up in
[02:16:32.980 --> 02:16:38.020]  the Fed's face. Sure. I mean, if the Fed's wrong about interest rates being at zero, being good,
[02:16:38.740 --> 02:16:43.380]  why is the IMF and World Bank, why are they cheerleading around? I guess the IMF's more European,
[02:16:43.380 --> 02:16:48.980]  World Bank's more U.S., but I'm the two are connected at the hip. But both those groups are
[02:16:48.980 --> 02:16:53.460]  basically saying the same thing. Yeah, well, they're not any smarter. In fact, the IMF is still
[02:16:53.460 --> 02:16:58.340]  projecting the U.S. economy to grow at about 2.2 percent this year, which, you know, there's no
[02:16:58.340 --> 02:17:02.420]  chance of that happening because if you look at how bad the first quarter is, the rest of the
[02:17:02.420 --> 02:17:07.060]  year is going to have to be above 3 percent. And I don't know why the IMF would actually believe
[02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:12.420]  that. It's more this propaganda. The IMF, they're a bunch of bureaucrats. They want to believe that
[02:17:12.420 --> 02:17:17.860]  the U.S. economy is going to be strong because that's the Federal Reserve. That's the central bank
[02:17:18.580 --> 02:17:23.140]  program. I mean, the government is trying to create economic growth and the IMF wants to
[02:17:23.140 --> 02:17:27.220]  pretend that they're successful. They don't want to acknowledge all this government failure.
[02:17:27.220 --> 02:17:31.300]  The only way to get real economic growth is to get the government out of the way.
[02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:35.620]  Institutions like the IMF just interfere with economic growth.
[02:17:35.620 --> 02:17:39.460]  I agree. We're about to go to break and I want to come back and ask you just front and center
[02:17:39.460 --> 02:17:42.500]  because you're the expert. Other key things about the economy you want to impart to folks.
[02:17:42.500 --> 02:17:46.580]  Peter Schiff's our guest. But separately, I'm not happy the economy's falling apart. I'm not happy.
[02:17:46.580 --> 02:17:51.140]  We're on a bubble. I'm not doomed and gloom. I just want to be honest with people. Our audience
[02:17:51.140 --> 02:17:56.100]  has been roughly doubling every year for the last five or six years. It's growing even faster,
[02:17:56.100 --> 02:18:00.100]  more affiliates, more people watching videos, more people watching podcasts.
[02:18:00.100 --> 02:18:05.140]  Until, I mean, this didn't even happen in 2008. But until about two or three years ago, as audience
[02:18:05.140 --> 02:18:09.860]  went up, our money went up, the amount of money coming in went up so I could expand with reporters
[02:18:09.860 --> 02:18:13.460]  and writers and everything else. Audience gets bigger, more money comes in. For the first time
[02:18:13.460 --> 02:18:19.380]  ever the last few years, our audience is exploding, but money is not going up, Peter. And I've gotten
[02:18:19.380 --> 02:18:24.420]  better at sponsors and raising money. So despite every trick I've got, it's harder than ever.
[02:18:24.420 --> 02:18:29.220]  Most media, as you know, is downsizing or going out of business. So I'm seeing it even in a quote
[02:18:29.220 --> 02:18:33.860]  boom town where we're based like Austin, Texas. I'm seeing it across the country.
[02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:39.460]  Yeah. Well, absolutely. I mean, people have less money. People have less money to spend. And so
[02:18:39.460 --> 02:18:41.700]  advertisers are cutting back and everybody's feeling it.
[02:18:42.740 --> 02:18:45.780]  So, so, I mean, you think that we may already actually be in a recession.
[02:18:46.420 --> 02:18:50.980]  Yeah. Well, all of the indicators, if you look at most of the economic indicators that are out
[02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:56.020]  there, they're flashing recession. I mean, the only thing that isn't is the low unemployment rate
[02:18:56.020 --> 02:18:59.860]  and the jobs that we're creating. But then when you look beneath the surface, and we've discussed
[02:18:59.860 --> 02:19:04.900]  this before on your program, when you realize that all the jobs that are being created are low
[02:19:04.900 --> 02:19:09.380]  paying part time jobs, the reason there are so many jobs is because people now have two or three.
[02:19:09.380 --> 02:19:13.780]  And so if you have three jobs that, you know, your account is having three instead of just one,
[02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:18.020]  but they don't add up to one good full time job. And you have lots of people who have left the
[02:19:18.020 --> 02:19:24.100]  labor force. And I think one of the reasons the unemployment claims are so low is because so few
[02:19:24.100 --> 02:19:27.940]  people are being hired that not that many people are being fired. You can't lose a job unless you
[02:19:27.940 --> 02:19:32.660]  get a job. And so since we're really creating so many, so few legitimate jobs, there's not a lot
[02:19:32.660 --> 02:19:38.500]  of people that are collecting unemployment. So this economy is very weak despite the rosy scenario,
[02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:42.820]  the fiction that the president is trying to paint, but Wall Street still doesn't get it. You know,
[02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:47.460]  if you look at performance, investment performance in the first quarter, this was the worst quarter
[02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:51.220]  for actively managed accounts in 18 years. Peter, stay there. Let's talk about the real

[02:23:56.660 --> 02:23:58.820]  current returns not indicative of future results.
[02:24:11.780 --> 02:24:14.580]  For the reason I'm talking about earthquakes, I'm going to talk some about that in the next segment.
[02:24:15.620 --> 02:24:19.780]  I'm not so obsessed with volcanoes and earthquakes. Some people really are into that.
[02:24:19.780 --> 02:24:23.140]  They like those movies. They're always worried about it. I guess you kind of do if you're living
[02:24:23.140 --> 02:24:29.140]  on California or something, or Japan, but they are saying all the seismologists, California,
[02:24:29.140 --> 02:24:33.860]  is way overdue. It's going to be like an 8.0 or bigger. What will that do to the economy?
[02:24:33.860 --> 02:24:39.220]  But it's a parallel to the economy already. People just don't think it's going to happen
[02:24:39.220 --> 02:24:43.460]  until it happens, and we're lined up for the biggest group of bubbles we've ever seen.
[02:24:44.100 --> 02:24:48.500]  Even the Royal Bank of Scotland says, sell everything you've got into the world type stuff.
[02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:54.660]  Now, coming out of George Soros and others. I'm just asking, wow, is that just hype,
[02:24:54.660 --> 02:24:59.860]  or how big is it going to be? Is there any way to avoid it? Peter Schiff was just getting into
[02:24:59.860 --> 02:25:04.420]  some of the numbers coming out, Peter. I was talking before the break about how
[02:25:04.980 --> 02:25:09.620]  investors still just don't get what's going on, because for the past several years,
[02:25:09.620 --> 02:25:13.780]  everybody's been positioned as if this recovery were real, that it were sustainable,
[02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:16.980]  and that the Fed could normalize interest rates, and everything was going to be fine.
[02:25:16.980 --> 02:25:21.300]  So they've been buying dollars, they've been buying certain assets. And the first quarter
[02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:27.620]  of this year, investment returns, it was the worst quarter in 18 years for actively managed funds.
[02:25:27.620 --> 02:25:32.820]  Most hedge funds lost money, barely any made any money at all, because they still don't get it.
[02:25:32.820 --> 02:25:36.500]  They still don't understand what's changed. Meanwhile, at Europe's Pacific Capital,
[02:25:36.500 --> 02:25:43.140]  we had one of our best quarters in years, probably since 2009, because we're positioned for reality.
[02:25:43.140 --> 02:25:47.780]  I've been saying for the last few years, as this bubble's been inflating, that this whole narrative
[02:25:47.780 --> 02:25:51.700]  has been wrong, that the Federal Reserve has not solved our problems, but exacerbated them.
[02:25:51.700 --> 02:25:55.780]  And you said that before 2008, so let me ask you this. I mean, speaking of earthquakes,
[02:25:55.780 --> 02:26:01.220]  you're famous for quoting, I mean, famous for this quote, 2008 was a trimmer
[02:26:01.220 --> 02:26:03.380]  for the earthquake that's coming. Is that what you're still saying?
[02:26:04.020 --> 02:26:09.380]  Yeah, and I've been saying that all along, even before 2008, because I saw 2008 coming,
[02:26:09.380 --> 02:26:15.620]  and unfortunately, I also saw how the government respond to 2008. And they did exactly what I
[02:26:15.620 --> 02:26:19.620]  feared that they would do, and what I warned they would do, and that is exactly why the real
[02:26:19.620 --> 02:26:24.180]  earthquake is still in our future. It's not in our past, and people have to prepare for that.
[02:26:24.180 --> 02:26:29.940]  And by the way, Silver hit a new high today for this year, for 2016. So people are starting to
[02:26:29.940 --> 02:26:33.380]  wake up. It's happening very slowly, but it's happening. And I think-
[02:26:33.380 --> 02:26:36.660]  Well, I'll say this, I mean, I think Dent's really smart, and I agree with him a lot of stuff,
[02:26:36.660 --> 02:26:44.100]  but when he thinks, because gold is so finite, that's why it's not valuable. I mean, the laws of
[02:26:44.100 --> 02:26:48.580]  economics I've seen, that makes it more valuable, and it has industrial uses, and all these elites
[02:26:48.580 --> 02:26:54.340]  are hoarding it. He's got it backwards. It's scarcity is what makes it so valuable. One of
[02:26:54.340 --> 02:26:58.580]  the things that makes it so valuable, if it was abundant, if it was everywhere, then obviously,
[02:26:58.580 --> 02:27:04.340]  it wouldn't have a lot of value. And the idea that because it's scarce, it can't function as money
[02:27:04.340 --> 02:27:08.100]  is completely ridiculous because gold is divisible. I mean, you could, you know,
[02:27:08.100 --> 02:27:12.500]  you can always adjust the price of gold higher. So there's, you never run out of it. There's always
[02:27:12.500 --> 02:27:15.860]  enough- Well, what about this though? We now know they've been manipulating gold and silver down,
[02:27:15.860 --> 02:27:20.260]  as you said many years ago was going on, and others did. They now admit that so much is rigged. So
[02:27:20.260 --> 02:27:24.580]  like the stock market, so much of it, like the interest rates, currency rates. I mean, how,
[02:27:24.580 --> 02:27:27.540]  how does rigging tie into it? Because they can always come up with new tricks.
[02:27:28.420 --> 02:27:32.340]  Yeah. Well, you know, you can only do that for so long. Look, if the government really could
[02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:37.300]  manipulate the gold market, gold wouldn't be at 1220. It would still be, you know, down at 300
[02:27:37.300 --> 02:27:42.020]  or lower where it was in 2000. Now, if they can rig markets- Well, we know they're trying is what
[02:27:42.020 --> 02:27:46.980]  I'm saying. Yeah, they try, but they're not going to succeed. The markets are much bigger. The
[02:27:46.980 --> 02:27:52.180]  fundamentals ultimately went out. They can succeed in delaying the inevitable. But all that does is
[02:27:52.180 --> 02:27:56.660]  make the inevitable bigger, right? So if, if the government is trying to prevent gold from going
[02:27:56.660 --> 02:28:00.260]  up, when it eventually does go up, it's going to go up even higher. That's what they say about
[02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:04.100]  earthquakes too. They say the fact that California is way overdue means there's even more pressure
[02:28:04.100 --> 02:28:08.580]  when it finally hits. Are you saying it's the same for economics? Yeah. I mean, those tremors are
[02:28:08.580 --> 02:28:12.340]  good because they take the pressure off the fault. You need the little tremors so you don't have a
[02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:16.580]  bigger quake. But think about wage and price controls. You know, what happens when the government
[02:28:16.580 --> 02:28:20.740]  has a price control on something for a while because they try to cover up the symptoms of
[02:28:20.740 --> 02:28:25.060]  inflation and then they give up and they take away the controls and then you get a huge spike in
[02:28:25.060 --> 02:28:29.380]  price. So if the government's going to try to manipulate the market, it's not going to last.
[02:28:29.380 --> 02:28:33.940]  But a lot of the manipulation isn't really manipulation. It's just people being foolish.
[02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:39.220]  You've got big banks like Goldman Sachs, shorting gold, telling their clients to short gold. A lot
[02:28:39.220 --> 02:28:43.860]  of people unfortunately listen to Goldman Sachs and they're doing the wrong thing. So a lot of
[02:28:43.860 --> 02:28:48.740]  times the markets are just mispriced because so many people don't get it. Just like all the people
[02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:53.060]  who were buying the subprime mortgages before the bottom dropped out of the market or all the people
[02:28:53.060 --> 02:28:57.540]  who were buying those.com stocks for several years before they collapsed. So the same thing's
[02:28:57.540 --> 02:29:03.140]  going to happen now. There's a lot of people following Peter Scott cut out for just a moment.
[02:29:03.140 --> 02:29:06.980]  We're trying to reconnect with them here at the end. You know, my job's fun in many ways. It's
[02:29:06.980 --> 02:29:11.140]  also scary. But the good news is time goes on. We're going to find out who's right and all this.
[02:29:11.140 --> 02:29:17.060]  Peter, you're Scott cut out for a moment. But EuroPak.com. Do you think it'll be evident that
[02:29:17.060 --> 02:29:21.540]  we're in a real global recession soon in the next few months or will it take later? Well,
[02:29:21.540 --> 02:29:27.940]  look, I think it's more of a U.S. room. Peter Schiff is gone. Hey, it's okay. It's got cut
[02:29:27.940 --> 02:29:32.820]  out at the end. Thank you, Peter, for joining us. EuroPak.com, Alex Jones with infowars.com
[02:29:32.820 --> 02:29:38.020]  and prisonplanet.com. Speaking of tremors, speaking of volcanoes, I'm going to hit some articles on
[02:29:38.020 --> 02:29:41.860]  that. When we come back, Lee and Mac will do a kind of important report. I've been hearing
[02:29:41.860 --> 02:29:45.940]  Aaron that sometimes as well. We'll get into the economy, some military news, a lot more than our
[02:29:45.940 --> 02:29:52.260]  reporters on the ground in Denver, Colorado. We're on the March, the empires on the run.
[02:29:53.140 --> 02:29:56.020]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:29:59.940 --> 02:30:05.460]  A Connecticut judge has placed herself above the Constitution and above an explicit congressional
[02:30:05.460 --> 02:30:11.220]  law. Judge Barbara Bellis has ruled that Sandy Hook families can sue gun manufacturers,
[02:30:11.220 --> 02:30:17.220]  Remington, Bushmaster and others. But Congress has already explicitly protected firearm
[02:30:17.220 --> 02:30:22.420]  manufacturers from liability and the protection of Lawful Commerce and Arms Act, which says
[02:30:22.420 --> 02:30:28.500]  they will not be held liable for, quote, the harm caused by those who criminally or unlawfully
[02:30:28.500 --> 02:30:34.820]  misused firearm products or ammunition products that function as designed and intended. The act
[02:30:34.820 --> 02:30:40.020]  goes on to explain to people with an anti-gun agenda like Judge Bellis that quote, the possibility
[02:30:40.020 --> 02:30:46.900]  of imposing liability on an entire industry for harm that is solely caused by others is an abuse
[02:30:46.900 --> 02:30:52.260]  of the legal system, unquote. What's next? Holding Ford liable for a drunk driver killing someone
[02:30:52.260 --> 02:30:56.500]  with the car that they made? If Hillary Clinton has her way, that's what they will do to gun
[02:30:56.500 --> 02:31:02.420]  manufacturers. For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight. Clean, pure drinking water. You can't survive

[02:33:22.100 --> 02:33:25.860]  Words are for the means to meaning, and for those who will listen,
[02:33:25.860 --> 02:33:32.420]  the enunciation of the truth. There is something terribly wrong with this country,
[02:33:32.420 --> 02:33:36.020]  isn't there? You designed it, sir. You wanted it foolproof. You taught me every television
[02:33:36.020 --> 02:33:41.220]  in longer. Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you have the
[02:33:41.220 --> 02:33:46.500]  freedom to object, if something can speak as you saw fit, you now have sensors and systems of
[02:33:46.500 --> 02:33:51.220]  surveillance coercing your conformity and suppressing your submachine. We need cameras.
[02:33:51.220 --> 02:33:56.580]  How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible
[02:33:56.580 --> 02:34:02.100]  than others. They will be held accountable. But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the
[02:34:02.100 --> 02:34:10.180]  guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't
[02:34:10.180 --> 02:34:17.700]  be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which inspired to corrupt your reason
[02:34:17.700 --> 02:34:23.300]  and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you. And in your panic, you turned to the
[02:34:23.300 --> 02:34:29.380]  now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order. He promised you peace. And all he
[02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:38.580]  demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent. There is a war. There is a war.
[02:34:38.580 --> 02:34:46.100]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose
[02:34:46.100 --> 02:34:51.460]  sides has come. We are the resistance. We are the Info War.
[02:34:57.380 --> 02:35:02.740]  There's a lot of amazing news up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com right now. We're going to be
[02:35:02.740 --> 02:35:09.700]  covering some of it. But if you're watching us on television, you see our standard yellow star.
[02:35:10.260 --> 02:35:18.020]  We call it the sun that we orbit. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and then out into the gas giants.
[02:35:21.380 --> 02:35:30.020]  And the Kuiper Belt. And one of the biggest threats is out there between the gas giants.
[02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:37.940]  And that's the asteroid field. It's estimated that there's equivalent of hundreds of planets
[02:35:37.940 --> 02:35:49.060]  worth of wreckage floating in orbit around the sun. And a lot of those get kicked out on different
[02:35:49.060 --> 02:35:56.580]  tracks, along with comets and other planetary visitors, and plunge into the Earth's surface.
[02:35:56.580 --> 02:36:01.060]  They even have serious discovery channels, scientific programs, where they now show
[02:36:01.060 --> 02:36:07.540]  satellite photos of the huge craters all over the world. Before the Shoemaker-Levy comment,
[02:36:10.100 --> 02:36:15.140]  was it Saturn it plunged into? Jupiter. Yeah, I remember having Shoemaker and
[02:36:15.140 --> 02:36:19.140]  Levy on before they died in a car wreck, or the Shoemaker family I've had Levy on after they died.
[02:36:19.140 --> 02:36:27.220]  And amateur professional quasi finding that comment and then estimating that it would hit Jupiter.
[02:36:28.260 --> 02:36:35.700]  And then the comet blowing holes, six holes as it broke up coming into the atmosphere,
[02:36:37.620 --> 02:36:45.620]  bigger than Earth. Some people even thought it might ignite, but it didn't. The gas giant.
[02:36:45.620 --> 02:36:53.780]  And turned it into a sun. In fact, if Jupiter got ignited, many estimated it would be a smaller,
[02:36:53.780 --> 02:36:59.220]  second sun. That's what the whole 2001 space odyssey thing ends with, and when Jupiter ignites
[02:36:59.220 --> 02:37:06.020]  into a sun and destroys the wormhole gate that's there, it's called Lucifer. So that's all the
[02:37:06.020 --> 02:37:10.820]  occultism of the establishment. And how they flaunted everybody's face.
[02:37:10.820 --> 02:37:20.500]  It was even a leaked NASA plan to actually run that project. But I digress.
[02:37:24.340 --> 02:37:29.620]  It was blowing holes in the side of the planet, the gas giant. You go look up for yourself,
[02:37:29.620 --> 02:37:33.220]  I'm going from memory here. Bigger than the Earth.
[02:37:33.220 --> 02:37:45.700]  Now, that's the universe we live in. And the United Nations voted back in Copenhagen when
[02:37:45.700 --> 02:37:50.260]  they were pushing World Government Conference five, six years ago, that the sun does not affect
[02:37:50.260 --> 02:37:57.460]  climate. Well, we know it's the main driver of climate. Tectonic energies are clearly,
[02:37:57.460 --> 02:37:59.860]  according to all the scientists I've interviewed, the experts.
[02:37:59.860 --> 02:38:06.100]  Again, I've gone and interviewed the experts. They always say, oh, you're not a scientist,
[02:38:06.100 --> 02:38:10.500]  you can't speak to these things. Barbara Boxer talking down to people like their idiots.
[02:38:11.700 --> 02:38:16.580]  But she only has the knowledge. That's an MSNBC attitude that anybody else that doesn't do exactly
[02:38:16.580 --> 02:38:20.180]  what they say is dumb and they're so smart that you go meet one of their followers,
[02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:26.020]  they can hardly talk. They're just ruled by these arrogant crones that set up on
[02:38:26.020 --> 02:38:30.420]  his mob bosses trying to ban free speech and restrict all these liberties. And oh,
[02:38:30.420 --> 02:38:34.900]  let's Bill and I, the science guy, let's arrest anybody that disagrees with man-made climate
[02:38:34.900 --> 02:38:45.220]  change. Thought it was warming. And so what I'm getting at here is the next big force
[02:38:46.340 --> 02:38:52.420]  is tectonic. The next big heat source is the Earth, still molten from its creation and the
[02:38:52.420 --> 02:38:58.500]  pressures of its mass. There's a debate whether the moon has a molten center or not.
[02:38:59.140 --> 02:39:02.580]  Most scientists think it's probably cool by now. It doesn't have the pressures needed to continue
[02:39:02.580 --> 02:39:09.700]  to heat. But those are some of the mysteries of the universe. Those are some of the things
[02:39:09.700 --> 02:39:18.100]  that scientists are still trying to completely discover. But we're in a very active universe.
[02:39:18.100 --> 02:39:22.740]  Again, if you're a radio listener, you can go to infowars.com or to the last show to see what
[02:39:22.740 --> 02:39:28.020]  I'm talking about adds another dimension, as I said, to the transmission. And then most experts
[02:39:28.020 --> 02:39:33.620]  agree, and this is the compendium of research, that the third driver of climate on the Earth,
[02:39:33.620 --> 02:39:38.100]  number one is the sun, number two is tectonic movement and heat, number three is the moon.
[02:39:39.140 --> 02:39:45.380]  The moon is huge. It controls the tides. It manipulates what's happening inside the Earth.
[02:39:45.380 --> 02:39:51.300]  It has a massive effect on when plants and animals release their pollen when they mate,
[02:39:51.300 --> 02:39:55.620]  when the fish run. It's all known to be kind of the clock of the Earth.
[02:39:57.220 --> 02:40:04.180]  And also the space winds and the solar winds are blocked by the moon. Even though it's smaller
[02:40:04.180 --> 02:40:08.500]  than the Earth, when the winds go over it, they have radio telescope shots of this
[02:40:08.500 --> 02:40:16.660]  and magnetic field telescopes. It goes like a teardrop over it, and the moon, when properly
[02:40:16.660 --> 02:40:24.020]  positioned, completely blocks the Earth from solar radiation and space winds. Pretty amazing,
[02:40:24.020 --> 02:40:30.260]  huh? Or space winds coming from that direction. There's just all sorts of different types of
[02:40:30.260 --> 02:40:35.300]  radiation and fields and light and dark matter energy that they know is there. They can read
[02:40:35.300 --> 02:40:39.460]  it on mirrors. It's stronger than our energy, but they can't, they can't tell what it is because
[02:40:39.460 --> 02:40:48.820]  it's interdimensional. But they see the pressure wavelengths of whatever is in those other dimensions
[02:40:48.820 --> 02:40:53.860]  weighing in, and they have lower dimensional fields showing up in higher dimensional fields
[02:40:53.860 --> 02:41:00.980]  and then other, other dimensional fields in vortexes. And then we have the establishment
[02:41:00.980 --> 02:41:08.180]  telling us that men reading teleprompters walking around on red carpets with foppish, sycophantic
[02:41:08.980 --> 02:41:19.300]  crowds telling them they're gods. And these are the people that endanger our planet that have
[02:41:19.300 --> 02:41:24.100]  created all sorts of super high-tech weapons and now think they're god or genetically engineering
[02:41:24.100 --> 02:41:31.860]  every species they can get their hands on that are creating cross-species Chimeras. Chimera, Chimera,
[02:41:32.900 --> 02:41:40.660]  potato patata. And there's just no sense of restraint in the race for power because, well,
[02:41:40.660 --> 02:41:45.060]  if we create the new AI supercomputers, it'll emerge less proliferated. And if we do all the
[02:41:45.060 --> 02:41:49.300]  genetic engineering randomly with the gene guns, randomly spricing thousands of species a day at
[02:41:49.300 --> 02:41:53.540]  major laboratories, we'll find new super secret, and we'll implant the humans and humanoid cows
[02:41:53.540 --> 02:41:57.460]  and sheep that are part human and won't reject it. The best part is the animals have no rights
[02:41:57.460 --> 02:42:00.420]  and the humans have no rights because they're not actually human or animal. And then the
[02:42:00.420 --> 02:42:05.300]  environmentalists are controlled by us through the globalist think tanks with Dr. Peter Singer
[02:42:05.300 --> 02:42:09.620]  and PETA is one of the animal liberation front and we're in control and guide the whole movement,
[02:42:09.620 --> 02:42:14.420]  don't warn anybody about the real problems. See, we got it all figured out.
[02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:18.980]  They got it all figured out.
[02:42:18.980 --> 02:42:24.020]  Wow. They know what they're doing.
[02:42:27.060 --> 02:42:36.100]  And I was talking to my lawyer yesterday. Yeah, let's look at that headline for a second.
[02:42:36.980 --> 02:42:39.220]  What's that out of the express?
[02:42:41.780 --> 02:42:46.740]  Yeah, London Express. Yeah, look at that scientist open mass cloning factory this year to clone
[02:42:46.740 --> 02:42:51.380]  cows, pets and humans. I noticed they always act like it hadn't really been developed yet.
[02:42:51.380 --> 02:42:56.660]  They've been cloning since the thirties with rabbits. They've been cloning humans we know
[02:42:56.660 --> 02:43:02.180]  since the fifties. And they just always, oh, we don't know if we can do that like we're children.
[02:43:10.100 --> 02:43:13.700]  And they've got all these weird cross species animals you can buy that rich people are getting
[02:43:13.700 --> 02:43:17.860]  stuff now and you tell the general public that they just roll your eyes. They have cross species
[02:43:17.860 --> 02:43:22.580]  salmon that's three times bigger and they admit is going to extinct regular salmon already in the
[02:43:22.580 --> 02:43:29.700]  ocean. Oh, they magically just let it go. Oh, oops, they're playing God, folks. They're on power
[02:43:29.700 --> 02:43:36.500]  trips. They're playing dice, Russian roulette on purpose for the nihilistic thrill of doing it all.
[02:43:36.500 --> 02:43:43.940]  And I've said it before I'll say it again. I don't know if there was a real in Lannis.
[02:43:43.940 --> 02:43:48.660]  Plato said it was real. Other cultures did as well blew up out by the Atlantic Ocean.
[02:43:50.900 --> 02:43:54.500]  They found all sorts of weird isotopes in the rock that submarines have gotten in the different
[02:43:54.500 --> 02:44:03.540]  areas. But here's what I'm getting at. Whether it's comics or whether it's asteroids,
[02:44:03.540 --> 02:44:08.820]  you add in new threat matrices is previously scientists said, oh, we believe every few
[02:44:08.820 --> 02:44:13.220]  million years a comet or huge asteroid that causes an earth changing event that darkens
[02:44:13.220 --> 02:44:17.300]  the skies for a few years, creates a mini ice age and kills most of the life forms.
[02:44:17.300 --> 02:44:21.140]  We think it happens every million, two million years now scientists have gone and they've studied
[02:44:21.700 --> 02:44:28.500]  the rock in thousands of large craters, hundreds of humongous ones,
[02:44:28.500 --> 02:44:37.540]  bigger than meteor crater out in Arizona. And they know that it happens probably every couple
[02:44:37.540 --> 02:44:44.020]  hundred thousand years or more because they find ice ages in the ice core samples that weren't
[02:44:44.740 --> 02:44:51.060]  a couple thousand years long on the dormancy cycle of the sun every 10-12,000 years. They're
[02:44:51.060 --> 02:44:56.260]  finding little ones and partial ones all over and then they check the isotopes and they check the
[02:44:56.260 --> 02:45:05.700]  different compound minerals that are created. And they know the signature of even certain
[02:45:05.700 --> 02:45:10.340]  meteors and what they were made out of and what those meteors slash asteroids did.
[02:45:11.620 --> 02:45:16.420]  And so we're sitting here with the clock going, I mean, you talk about a global government,
[02:45:16.420 --> 02:45:22.340]  it should be a consortium of nations working together to have anti-common and anti-astroid
[02:45:22.340 --> 02:45:27.060]  defense systems. But see, they don't want you to have all that. There's a race to get all the power
[02:45:27.060 --> 02:45:32.420]  first for the elite, wall us off, dumb us down, cull us out with mind control and bioweapons.
[02:45:37.060 --> 02:45:42.500]  While they're all racing as fast as they can to get life extension and then they think super
[02:45:42.500 --> 02:45:49.460]  computers will be so fast and so great, they'll just manifest all these super technologies
[02:45:49.460 --> 02:45:54.740]  overnight in the singularity when the singularity is just something that Ray Kurzweil came up with
[02:45:54.740 --> 02:45:59.540]  who thinks he's going to resurrect his dead dad with his dad's diary and papers.
[02:46:01.060 --> 02:46:04.980]  No, Kurzweil, you're not going to resurrect your dead dad with that. Maybe in the future,
[02:46:04.980 --> 02:46:08.660]  you could record everything in his brain, have a copy of it and claim that was really him,
[02:46:08.660 --> 02:46:14.180]  but it won't be his essence, his soul, his spirit. But your daddy ain't coming back, wack job.
[02:46:14.180 --> 02:46:18.900]  And you're not going to become the first god.
[02:46:20.980 --> 02:46:27.460]  Look around you brother, there is a real god, you ain't it, I ain't it. You arrogant, narcissistic
[02:46:27.460 --> 02:46:32.740]  loon bag. I deal with so many crazy people in my life and they're savage, they're nuts,
[02:46:32.740 --> 02:46:37.140]  they think they're invincible, they're easy to defeat like a lobotomized zombie, but you still
[02:46:37.140 --> 02:46:41.540]  got to deal with them. It's like having one in your backyard is crawling along and you can't
[02:46:41.540 --> 02:46:44.100]  sit there and have lemonade, you're going to fall asleep as long as you chew your throat out.
[02:46:46.980 --> 02:46:52.980]  They just think they're so smart. The arrogance, the delusion because we've created an artificial
[02:46:52.980 --> 02:46:58.180]  world where people don't have to live in the real confines of the real world. People started fights,
[02:46:58.180 --> 02:47:02.100]  they've pushed people around, they've done stuff, and they've never had to get their
[02:47:02.100 --> 02:47:08.340]  nose broken for it. And that's why they want a nanny state. So all these little babies are
[02:47:08.340 --> 02:47:12.740]  delusional and don't live in the real world and don't understand what's really going on and don't
[02:47:12.740 --> 02:47:18.180]  have any real ideas about what they're dealing with. So they're not worried about NSA spying,
[02:47:18.180 --> 02:47:21.220]  they're not worried about checkpoints, they're not worried about forced vaccines, they're not
[02:47:21.220 --> 02:47:24.660]  worried about GMO, they're not worried about anything because they are delusional until they
[02:47:24.660 --> 02:47:29.860]  get cancer or until they get a neurological disorder and then they go to the races and sit in
[02:47:29.860 --> 02:47:34.660]  the stands, you know, dying of cancer and everybody waves at them when they go for the jog,
[02:47:34.660 --> 02:47:38.740]  the, you know, the 10k to raise money and then they feel like a victim and are a movie star
[02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:45.380]  while they're dying and, you know, get all into it and they've got a whole program for you.
[02:47:46.100 --> 02:47:50.340]  And oh, the end of humanity's coming and we'll all be little rock stars during it and it's,
[02:47:50.340 --> 02:47:53.300]  we all knew our species was bad and we're all just going to accept it.
[02:47:57.860 --> 02:48:01.780]  So you think nothing's going to happen to you till it's happening to you. And I'm telling you
[02:48:01.780 --> 02:48:05.380]  folks, it is happening too. Our children are being brain damaged and brainwashed by the TV
[02:48:05.380 --> 02:48:11.860]  and the screen time. The GMO is killing us and changing our DNA. The elite are like psychomad
[02:48:11.860 --> 02:48:17.540]  scientists on PCP. There are hundreds of volcanoes suddenly becoming active at a level they've never
[02:48:17.540 --> 02:48:22.340]  seen in modern history. There are all sorts of sinkholes forming everywhere, earthquakes happening
[02:48:22.340 --> 02:48:27.380]  all over the place, crazy mass die-offs and stuff going on, all sorts of secret testing going on.
[02:48:27.380 --> 02:48:33.140]  The elite are trying to kill the planet, as best I can tell, while they claim they're trying to save it.
[02:48:34.420 --> 02:48:38.820]  High school textbooks we've shown you teach children that there is chemtrailing going on
[02:48:40.420 --> 02:48:44.420]  and that they're doing it to save the earth. I got sent links this weekend by friends that it was
[02:48:44.420 --> 02:48:48.820]  on Weather Channel admitting their chemtrailing and said how they do it for our own good. See,
[02:48:48.820 --> 02:48:52.580]  it doesn't exist, but we're doing it. There is no global government, but we're doing it.
[02:48:53.380 --> 02:48:56.260]  There is a secret Department of Energy program, but it's not what the cooks say,
[02:48:56.260 --> 02:49:02.260]  it's for your own good. And then we find out all over the world the aluminum is getting so high,
[02:49:02.260 --> 02:49:08.900]  plants can't grow and are dying. Why are you doing this new world order? Well, you come to kill,
[02:49:08.900 --> 02:49:13.700]  steal and destroy. I mean, I'm not saying you're the devil, that's what the Bible says he does,
[02:49:13.700 --> 02:49:20.020]  you want to come to kill, steal and destroy. And you go about like a lion roaring, seeing who you
[02:49:20.020 --> 02:49:27.700]  may devour. Because I used to think that that was like in, you know, Friday the 13th movies with
[02:49:27.700 --> 02:49:32.260]  the guy's woman's running and she falls down on purpose and then crawls on her, you know, legs.
[02:49:33.380 --> 02:49:37.860]  Don't get me. I used to think, oh, that's made up. Then I've actually seen video and footage now
[02:49:37.860 --> 02:49:42.180]  and, you know, crime scene stuff where that's actually what a lot of people do is they fall down.
[02:49:42.180 --> 02:49:47.700]  Someone walks their house with a butcher knife, grown men is going, and the person gets to stab
[02:49:47.700 --> 02:49:52.340]  them. That was bred into you. The wimpiest person a hundred years ago, I don't care if it was the
[02:49:52.340 --> 02:49:56.340]  US, Africa, Germany, Mexico, I don't care where you were, you come pull an iPhone, anybody,
[02:49:56.340 --> 02:50:02.580]  they're going to fight you because they got an instinct. But see, they flipped the instinct off.
[02:50:03.940 --> 02:50:07.700]  I mean, somebody walks here with a butcher knife to attack me, this table's going over on them.
[02:50:07.700 --> 02:50:11.220]  I'm going to literally, my teeth are going to, I mean, I'm going to just literally start
[02:50:11.220 --> 02:50:15.140]  burying my teeth and just go completely ape on them. It's not because I'm even a tough guy,
[02:50:15.140 --> 02:50:20.660]  I'm normal. You want to kill me? How about you die? And that's what I'm telling the New World Order.
[02:50:20.660 --> 02:50:26.660]  Listen, I see you, man, you're ugly, man, you stink, man, you're evil. Wow. If there,
[02:50:26.660 --> 02:50:31.060]  what the devil before, you've now manifested it, you're at Satan's Reel. And you know what?
[02:50:32.340 --> 02:50:36.820]  I look at you, you snot nose demon-eyed maggot, I'm going to get my hands around your neck with
[02:50:36.820 --> 02:50:42.900]  God's help. And we're going to absolutely metaphysically twist your head off your little
[02:50:42.900 --> 02:50:48.740]  shoulders. All I know is I don't want to be around this or a part of it. And I've got all this
[02:50:48.740 --> 02:50:53.220]  earthquake news. Five major earthquakes in 48 hours. The seismologists warned catastrophic
[02:50:53.220 --> 02:50:57.140]  mega earthquakes are coming. Scientists for the big one is coming. Four major earthquakes,
[02:50:57.140 --> 02:51:02.420]  48 volcanoes going crazy. You name it. Hello, I'm Michael Reagan. My father,

[02:54:37.060 --> 02:54:41.140]  I'm going to hit this Russia story that's on infowars.com. It's pretty important.
[02:54:42.500 --> 02:54:45.620]  I'll do five minutes the next hour. The David Knight takes over with our crews. They're on the
[02:54:45.620 --> 02:54:53.060]  ground there in Denver. That's only coming up here in about 10 minutes or so. Briefly, this
[02:54:53.060 --> 02:54:57.220]  is a listener-supported broadcast. Everybody knows that. That's how we fund the operation.
[02:54:57.220 --> 02:55:03.540]  And we saw a lot of really great products. And you heard me talking to Peter Schiff earlier
[02:55:04.340 --> 02:55:09.060]  about how our audience just gets bigger, but expanded funds don't come in. And we're doing
[02:55:09.060 --> 02:55:14.260]  okay. We can pay our crew and things, but it gets really hard to do more. And it just gets
[02:55:14.260 --> 02:55:18.660]  down to the fact that I want to be able to continue what we're doing and hopefully expand.
[02:55:18.660 --> 02:55:20.980]  And then I know things are probably going to get worse down the road. So I'm thinking,
[02:55:20.980 --> 02:55:27.220]  man, I just want to keep where I'm at. And so please shop with the good guys. Plant a garden

[02:59:55.060 --> 03:00:12.580]  It's hour number four kickoff. Here's some freedom lovers waging war on corruption.
[03:00:12.580 --> 03:00:19.540]  It's Alex Jones coming to you right from the front lines of the info war. Oh yeah,
[03:00:19.540 --> 03:00:25.860]  it's the front lines baby, you can believe it. Truthfully, most people that fight tyranny
[03:00:25.860 --> 03:00:33.140]  aren't going to run into a lot of trouble, but till you get to this level, it gets pretty weird.
[03:00:35.940 --> 03:00:40.900]  Man, I wish I could tell people all the stuff. I wish I could tell you.
[03:00:40.900 --> 03:00:48.820]  But let me tell you, the system and the guy running it, they've got a lot of tricks up their sleeve.
[03:00:51.380 --> 03:00:58.180]  The good news is, there's a real god runs this universe and he's got a lot more tricks up his
[03:00:58.180 --> 03:01:08.340]  sleeve as well. All my enemies out there that attack, they end up all of them getting a piece of the
[03:01:08.340 --> 03:01:20.900]  action. I just got to sit back and watch it happen. I'll tell you this though, we're only
[03:01:20.900 --> 03:01:24.100]  going to get in the worst position, groveling to the globalists. We got to stand up to them as
[03:01:24.100 --> 03:01:31.060]  hardcore as we can. That is the safest path out of this tyranny. All right, let me hit some of
[03:01:31.060 --> 03:01:36.180]  the other news. I mentioned this, I'm going to get to this right now. Exclusive Colorado Caucus
[03:01:36.180 --> 03:01:40.660]  volunteers, our folks are going to be on in like five minutes, Rob doing others.
[03:01:42.580 --> 03:01:47.300]  Colorado Caucus volunteers, ballot errors hurt Trump delegate candidates, could have violated
[03:01:47.300 --> 03:01:53.140]  the state rules. Well, of course they did. Volunteers of the Colorado Republican Assembly
[03:01:53.140 --> 03:01:57.940]  are coming forward with evidence that indicates that their state delegate selection process
[03:01:57.940 --> 03:02:02.020]  was riddled with errors that disadvantaged some Donald Trump supporters who were
[03:02:02.020 --> 03:02:08.820]  running to become national delegates. Well, yeah, they blocked out all the real delegates and then
[03:02:08.820 --> 03:02:14.820]  just chose them. And then Right Bar is looking at this, not from a criminal mindset, you know,
[03:02:14.820 --> 03:02:20.020]  trying to look fair, saying, oh, and then they just didn't get to get voted for. It was wrong.
[03:02:20.020 --> 03:02:25.060]  No, it was all fixed. That's how Cruz got all the delegates. Cruz didn't get all the, every
[03:02:25.060 --> 03:02:29.460]  delegate was it for him. Even they tried to rig it, you just can't magically have all of them for you.
[03:02:29.460 --> 03:02:34.020]  Canceling the election was rigging number one. Then they didn't want anybody for them.
[03:02:34.580 --> 03:02:39.620]  They're like, oh, maybe the ballots weren't right. I'll think, think so. Think so, really?
[03:02:42.580 --> 03:02:47.060]  Ted Cruz took all 34 delegates last week in a process that closed down traditional caucus
[03:02:47.060 --> 03:02:53.060]  voting the public. Oh, closed down traditional voting. No big deal. A handful of volunteers
[03:02:53.060 --> 03:02:57.220]  spoke to Right Bar News about the process. I'm the former chairman of the Pueblo County
[03:02:57.220 --> 03:03:01.220]  Republican Party and the person who developed the states of national delegates from Trump team.
[03:03:01.220 --> 03:03:05.300]  Colorado GOP website was filled with errors posted about the national delegates.
[03:03:05.300 --> 03:03:09.860]  Was it errors? That's the fog award confuse you. Nancy Mazzell told Right Bar News. Let's get Nancy
[03:03:09.860 --> 03:03:14.180]  Mazzell on. Because you're going to see it in more states. Mazzell took a photograph of a ballot,
[03:03:14.180 --> 03:03:19.220]  and we covered this last week on a YouTube video or this Monday. Congressional District 7 and see,
[03:03:19.220 --> 03:03:22.740]  I'm not mad at my reporters. I don't have as big a staff as Right Bar. I wanted to do a story on
[03:03:22.740 --> 03:03:26.660]  this. Mazzell, because we have the video, took a photograph of the ballot, Congressional District
[03:03:26.660 --> 03:03:31.300]  7 that included only the ballot numbers of delegate candidates, not the names and candidates
[03:03:31.300 --> 03:03:37.060]  required by state bylaws. It just goes on from there. I mean, you talk about hanky-panky. This is it.
[03:03:40.980 --> 03:03:44.740]  Now, let's continue here. Here is another article that Steve Watson
[03:03:45.620 --> 03:03:51.940]  did dealing with Hillary, excuse me, Hillary Clinton. I actually did say Hillary wrong there.
[03:03:51.940 --> 03:03:58.660]  That wasn't a joke. A phone transcript proves Hillary lied about Benghazi attack. Clinton told
[03:03:58.660 --> 03:04:03.620]  Egyptian Prime Minister, we know the attack in Libya has nothing to do with the film. A transcript
[03:04:03.620 --> 03:04:06.820]  of the telephone conversation when we saw the State Department proves once and for all that
[03:04:06.820 --> 03:04:10.660]  Hillary Clinton knowingly lied about the Benghazi attacks, the American diplomatic compound.
[03:04:11.300 --> 03:04:15.540]  The transcript obtained by a four-year request by judicial watch, they do such a good job,
[03:04:15.540 --> 03:04:19.380]  details a call immediately after the attack between then Secretary of State and then
[03:04:19.380 --> 03:04:24.260]  Egyptian Prime Minister. We know the attack in Libya has nothing to do with the film. Clinton
[03:04:24.260 --> 03:04:30.420]  told him it was planned attack, not a protest. The Prime Minister went on, you're not kidding.
[03:04:30.420 --> 03:04:33.620]  Based on information we saw, we believe that group had claimed responsibility for this
[03:04:33.620 --> 03:04:37.060]  affiliate with Al Qaeda. Well, too, they had running security in the area. It was all states.
[03:04:37.060 --> 03:04:44.580]  That's just another lie she got caught in. Another lie. All right. He's getting suited up.
[03:04:44.580 --> 03:04:50.660]  He's loaded for bear and nothing on earth gonna stop him. David Knight coming out of the bullpen
[03:04:50.660 --> 03:04:57.300]  in T minus three minutes, seven seconds. I'm Alex Jones. Join us in the epic fight for human
[03:04:57.300 --> 03:05:03.380]  liberty. Join us in the info war. A seismologist warns that catastrophic mega earthquakes are
[03:05:03.380 --> 03:05:09.380]  on their way after five major earthquakes took place in the last 48 hours. Seismologist Roger
[03:05:09.380 --> 03:05:14.260]  Bilham of the University of Colorado has made headlines all over the world by warning that
[03:05:14.260 --> 03:05:19.780]  current conditions might trigger at least four earthquakes greater than 8.0 in magnitude. If
[03:05:19.780 --> 03:05:24.180]  his projections are accurate, our planet could be on the precipice of a wave of natural disasters
[03:05:24.180 --> 03:05:28.980]  unlike anything that any of us have witnessed before. A single magnitude 8.0 earthquake in a
[03:05:28.980 --> 03:05:34.180]  populated area would be a disaster of historic proportions. But four of them, that would be a
[03:05:34.180 --> 03:05:39.780]  complete and utter nightmare. And according to volcano discovery, 38 volcanoes around the globe
[03:05:39.780 --> 03:05:45.300]  are erupting right now. Michael Snyder asks, why is this happening? Why is the crust of the earth
[03:05:45.300 --> 03:05:50.580]  shaking so violently all of a sudden? In Matthew 24, Jesus warned us that there would be earthquakes
[03:05:50.580 --> 03:05:55.700]  in diverse places just prior to his return. Are we truly in the times that the Bible refers to
[03:05:55.700 --> 03:06:01.300]  as the last days? Read more right now at infowars.com. Over the years, there have been a lot of

[03:08:19.780 --> 03:08:27.060]  It's April 15th. You know what that means, or do you? It may not be the same day you think it is.
[03:08:27.620 --> 03:08:33.380]  Power of power, and of course, the power to tax is the power to destroy. That's power, power,
[03:08:33.380 --> 03:08:38.420]  tax to the max. One of my favorite songs, especially at this time of year. You know,
[03:08:38.420 --> 03:08:43.220]  today is April 15th. That may be the day you think you have to file your taxes, but in a good example
[03:08:43.220 --> 03:08:49.780]  of how even the tax deadline is convoluted and loaded with exceptions, listen to this,
[03:08:49.780 --> 03:08:55.220]  I wasn't even aware of this until today myself. Tax day will not be today, but will be Monday,
[03:08:55.220 --> 03:09:00.020]  April the 18th. Traditionally, it's on April the 15th unless it falls on a weekend. However,
[03:09:01.060 --> 03:09:08.180]  in the District of Columbia, they are celebrating Emancipation Day. Now, Emancipation Day falls
[03:09:08.180 --> 03:09:14.420]  on Saturday. You would say, well, why don't they just celebrate it on Monday? No, no, the law says
[03:09:14.420 --> 03:09:19.140]  that if it falls on a weekend, it's observed on the day that is closest to the weekday,
[03:09:19.140 --> 03:09:24.580]  that is closest to it. That would mean that since it comes on the 16th, they have to celebrate it
[03:09:24.580 --> 03:09:32.260]  on the 15th and not on the 18th. Oh, okay. So therefore, they're going to move that because in
[03:09:32.260 --> 03:09:39.460]  Washington DC, they're celebrating Emancipation Day. Do you feel emancipated? I don't feel emancipated
[03:09:39.460 --> 03:09:44.660]  with this, but it gets even better, okay? It gets even better because for those people who are doing
[03:09:44.660 --> 03:09:51.540]  returns in Maine or Massachusetts, they get another day because that's the holiday this coming Monday.
[03:09:52.260 --> 03:09:57.540]  The deadline will be April the 19th because they're celebrating Patriots Day, which actually was
[03:09:57.540 --> 03:10:02.260]  the move against Concord and Lexington was actually on April the 19th, but they're celebrating it on
[03:10:02.260 --> 03:10:06.580]  April the 18th. How's that for the federal government? But of course, if you need more time,
[03:10:06.580 --> 03:10:13.140]  you can always get Form 4868, and you can fill that out and send that to the appropriate place,
[03:10:13.140 --> 03:10:17.780]  but you need to check the instructions to see where you're going to send that. Have you had enough?
[03:10:17.780 --> 03:10:25.380]  I've had enough. You know, I ran with the Libertarian Party. What was it?
[03:10:25.380 --> 03:10:32.340]  What was it about 20 years ago? 20 years ago exactly, ran for Congress.
[03:10:33.460 --> 03:10:38.580]  First thing I said was, let's get rid of the income tax, okay? It was something that Harry
[03:10:38.580 --> 03:10:44.100]  Brown, who was running for president at the time, first time he said, you know, the income tax doesn't
[03:10:44.100 --> 03:10:48.260]  fund our government. It only funds a very small part of the government. We have other taxes that
[03:10:48.260 --> 03:10:52.980]  are there. We could make other taxes instead of the income tax. We don't necessarily have to get
[03:10:52.980 --> 03:10:57.860]  our taxes through the income tax, right? We can get it through a flat tax, a sales tax,
[03:10:57.860 --> 03:11:01.140]  but you've got to be careful when they come up with these alternative plans. They're typically
[03:11:01.140 --> 03:11:06.500]  going to add them and not replace them. I understand that, okay? But still, if you just cut out the
[03:11:06.500 --> 03:11:12.820]  income tax, cut out the IRS, what would happen to our country? Well, you would really only have to
[03:11:12.820 --> 03:11:17.060]  go back, and it varies. We've looked at the numbers, and you only have to go back typically,
[03:11:17.060 --> 03:11:20.900]  especially because the government is growing so quickly. You typically only have to go back about
[03:11:20.900 --> 03:11:26.420]  six or seven years, and that's how fast our government is growing, and that's how little
[03:11:26.420 --> 03:11:30.420]  the income tax contributes to the operation of our government. So could you live with the
[03:11:30.420 --> 03:11:34.660]  government that was the size it was six or seven years ago in order to get rid of the income tax?
[03:11:35.380 --> 03:11:38.500]  Now is the time to think about that. You really should think about that.
[03:11:39.060 --> 03:11:42.500]  And, you know, let me just throw this in as a historical aside. I don't want to get too far
[03:11:42.500 --> 03:11:47.620]  off of the track here, but Emancipation Day, okay, great. Ending slavery was a great thing,
[03:11:47.620 --> 03:11:54.820]  but Emancipation Proclamation didn't free a single slave. Look it up. Abraham Lincoln was
[03:11:54.820 --> 03:12:00.740]  very careful to only free the slaves in the states that were still under the Confederate
[03:12:00.740 --> 03:12:06.980]  states of America. All the slaves that were in states that he controlled, he did not free,
[03:12:07.860 --> 03:12:15.060]  which is why Ulysses Grant kept his slaves until after the Civil War, when they were
[03:12:15.060 --> 03:12:20.100]  eliminated by the 14th Amendment. So Emancipation Day itself is also a fraud, and I don't feel very
[03:12:20.100 --> 03:12:24.340]  emancipated today as we're looking at the taxes. Now, look at this article here.
[03:12:24.340 --> 03:12:29.860]  Insurers are warning that losses from Obamacare are unsustainable, and I think that's interesting
[03:12:29.860 --> 03:12:35.060]  because, you know, Justice Roberts in the Supreme Court told us that Obamacare isn't an
[03:12:35.060 --> 03:12:42.020]  unconstitutional mandate. No, it's a tax. Yeah, it's a tax like Admiral Ackbar. It's a tax.
[03:12:42.020 --> 03:12:49.300]  It's a tax. It's a tax. Well, that tax, which is an onerous part of doing your income tax,
[03:12:50.340 --> 03:12:53.460]  is also something that is not working out very well. Health insurance companies
[03:12:54.020 --> 03:12:58.100]  are amplifying their warning about the financial sustainability of the Obamacare
[03:12:58.100 --> 03:13:04.260]  marketplace as they seek approval for premium increases next year in the Affordable Care Act.
[03:13:04.820 --> 03:13:09.780]  Now, we've got to have even more increases. We had a slew of increases at the onset,
[03:13:09.780 --> 03:13:15.620]  but it still isn't working. They need even more with all of the mandates because it's not just
[03:13:15.620 --> 03:13:22.500]  mandated that you buy it. It's also mandated that celibate nuns have to get birth control
[03:13:22.500 --> 03:13:27.780]  insurance, okay, or abortion insurance. Insurance say insurers say that they're losing money on
[03:13:27.780 --> 03:13:32.420]  their Obamacare plans at a rapid rate. Some have begun to talk about dropping out of the marketplace
[03:13:32.420 --> 03:13:36.900]  altogether. This is a story from The Hill. Something has to give, says an expert on the health
[03:13:36.900 --> 03:13:41.700]  law. The Kaiser Family Foundation said either insurers will drop out or they will raise premiums.
[03:13:41.700 --> 03:13:46.820]  In the short term, there is a growing likelihood that insurers will push for substantial premium
[03:13:46.820 --> 03:13:52.660]  increases, creating a political problem for Democrats in an election year, you think? Yeah,
[03:13:52.660 --> 03:14:01.220]  maybe it will. We have an amazing admission from Google that has buried in a patent for
[03:14:01.220 --> 03:14:05.940]  self-driving cars. I want to get to that in just a minute. Before I do, I want to comment because
[03:14:05.940 --> 03:14:10.260]  Alex has played several times this clip going back and forth with Barbara Boxer,
[03:14:11.460 --> 03:14:19.220]  brow-beating a guy who is speaking against man-made climate change. I thought it was
[03:14:19.220 --> 03:14:23.700]  interesting in that clip, she says to one guy, what are you? He goes, I'm a philosopher. Well,
[03:14:23.700 --> 03:14:28.420]  why aren't we talking to you? We need to have scientists here. Barbara Boxer wants to play
[03:14:28.420 --> 03:14:32.580]  the credentials game. Barbara Boxer is not a scientist. She's got a BS in economics. She worked
[03:14:32.580 --> 03:14:38.180]  as a stockbroker and then as a journalist. Bill Nye, the science guy, okay? He's kind of a science
[03:14:38.180 --> 03:14:43.140]  guy. He's got an engineering degree like me. He's got a mechanical engineering degree, but you
[03:14:43.140 --> 03:14:48.020]  know the problem is I don't think he learned too much because one of the first things they
[03:14:48.020 --> 03:14:55.220]  teach you in engineering is that you got to know what your tolerances are, Bill. Okay? So yeah,
[03:14:55.220 --> 03:15:00.660]  we can look at it and we can say the obvious thing is that the sun has the biggest effect on our
[03:15:00.660 --> 03:15:05.220]  climate, but even when they go back and play with these numbers and they say the earth is going to
[03:15:05.220 --> 03:15:11.860]  melt if we've got a two degree or one degree increase in temperature. Yeah, I'm with John Coleman,
[03:15:11.860 --> 03:15:17.060]  the guy that Alex has interviewed multiple times, the guy who was the founder of the weather channel.
[03:15:17.060 --> 03:15:25.780]  This is a guy who understands tolerances. This is a guy who grew up looking at the weather,
[03:15:25.780 --> 03:15:30.020]  studying the weather, trying to predict the weather. He knows you're not going to be able to predict
[03:15:30.020 --> 03:15:35.700]  the weather, especially with these untested models, 10 years, 50 years, decades out. You're not going
[03:15:35.700 --> 03:15:40.180]  to be able to predict it that way. It's absolute total nonsense. And to say that you're going to
[03:15:40.180 --> 03:15:46.900]  have the sky fall in, if there's a change in one degree, you don't have base measurements that fall
[03:15:46.900 --> 03:15:52.100]  within that tolerance. He said over and over again. He said, look, when I was going up, we had these
[03:15:52.100 --> 03:15:55.460]  thermometers. You may have seen them. You know, they didn't have the nice little digital readouts.
[03:15:55.460 --> 03:16:01.380]  You get a digital readout, you think it is 100% accurate. It's not. It's not. When people stop
[03:16:01.380 --> 03:16:07.700]  using analog devices like slide rules and thermometers, mercury in it, they seem to lose
[03:16:07.700 --> 03:16:12.580]  their understanding of what the tolerances are on these devices. So when you've got something that's
[03:16:12.580 --> 03:16:19.620]  a mercury thermometer, you understand you've got parallax error with it. You've also got error that
[03:16:19.620 --> 03:16:22.820]  can be introduced based on where you're doing the temperature measurements. And of course,
[03:16:22.820 --> 03:16:26.660]  they rigged that as well. You can get a very different measurement if you're measuring out in
[03:16:26.660 --> 03:16:33.220]  the countryside in a forest than if you're measuring in the city or on an airport tarmac,
[03:16:33.940 --> 03:16:38.660]  which is where they put a lot of these. And so, yeah, Bill Nye, if he is a scientist, maybe he's
[03:16:38.660 --> 03:16:43.780]  not a scientist. They ought to put that disclaimer. Remember he had, it was Robert Young, the guy who
[03:16:43.780 --> 03:16:50.100]  played Marcus Welby, MD. And he started cutting ads for Big Pharma. And he said, I'm not a doctor,
[03:16:50.100 --> 03:16:54.820]  actually. I just play one on television. Well, Bill Nye should have that same disclaimer,
[03:16:54.820 --> 03:16:58.580]  especially because even if he's an engineer, he doesn't know anything about tolerances. But
[03:16:58.580 --> 03:17:03.780]  getting back to the irony of this, Barbara Boxer, the irony of her coming down in somebody's credentials
[03:17:04.500 --> 03:17:10.100]  because they say they're a philosopher, and then the irony of her saying to this priest who's trying
[03:17:10.100 --> 03:17:15.540]  to explain something to her about the Pope doesn't have authority to speak as a scientist
[03:17:15.540 --> 03:17:20.980]  after she's just dressed this other guy down as being a philosopher and having no authority to
[03:17:20.980 --> 03:17:28.660]  talk on the issue. Then she gets on this priest by saying, well, don't you follow the Pope?
[03:17:28.660 --> 03:17:33.300]  Don't you care what the Pope says? It's like, hey, lady, the Pope is not a scientist either.
[03:17:33.300 --> 03:17:37.620]  Neither are you. And so she says, well, you disagree with the Pope. I think you ought to
[03:17:37.620 --> 03:17:42.900]  talk with Reverend Wilson. He goes, well, by the way, he is not a scientist either. So
[03:17:42.900 --> 03:17:47.380]  when we look at science and we want to look at where this is going, let's take a look at what
[03:17:47.380 --> 03:17:52.740]  Google is saying and this amazing admission, I think this is a patent. And the way it was put
[03:17:52.740 --> 03:17:57.860]  out by Daily Mail, I thought was very amusing. The headline from Daily Mail sounds like they
[03:17:57.860 --> 03:18:03.940]  really are onto something. It says Google's self-driving cars may soon predict what drivers
[03:18:03.940 --> 03:18:09.700]  are going to do next. Wow. Wow, this is like that. What is this like a pre-crime data analysis or
[03:18:09.700 --> 03:18:13.620]  something? They jacked into your mind. They're going to know where you're going to go. No,
[03:18:13.620 --> 03:18:18.980]  actually they're coming up with a patent to reveal plans where sensors will be able to
[03:18:19.940 --> 03:18:25.460]  look at your turn signals. That's the mind reading. That's the prediction of what drivers
[03:18:25.460 --> 03:18:30.420]  are going to do. These self-driving cars are going to be able to look at your turn signals
[03:18:30.420 --> 03:18:35.460]  and predict your actions. Who would have thought that could happen? Isn't science amazing?
[03:18:35.460 --> 03:18:39.700]  Stay with us, boys and girls. It gets more interesting even as they're going to do this.
[03:18:39.700 --> 03:18:46.660]  They're going to look at turn signals and at braking lights. Now, the Daily Mail,
[03:18:46.660 --> 03:18:50.580]  after being absolutely astonished that this is something that's going to be coming,
[03:18:50.580 --> 03:18:56.500]  I looked at this and I said, you mean the self-driving cars can't look at brake lights? They
[03:18:56.500 --> 03:19:03.220]  can't look at turn signals now? Why do they have them on the road? Maybe this explains
[03:19:03.220 --> 03:19:09.700]  why they've been involved in so many accidents at a rate that is an order of magnitude more
[03:19:09.700 --> 03:19:14.180]  than a human driver would have. But of course, they're bringing hit in the back. Okay, so it's
[03:19:14.180 --> 03:19:20.100]  never their fault legally, except when they just turned into the school bus or it wasn't a school
[03:19:20.100 --> 03:19:26.100]  bus. It was a public bus. They actually kind of sort of admitted to being at fault with.
[03:19:26.100 --> 03:19:34.020]  But I tell you, if they can't read the brake signals, then that may explain why they have so
[03:19:34.020 --> 03:19:40.740]  many accidents. Because it's going to be a little bit late in terms of reacting to this,
[03:19:40.740 --> 03:19:44.180]  so that they're going to slam on the brakes and somebody's going to slam into them. They say,
[03:19:44.180 --> 03:19:48.980]  details of this engineering patent filed by Google with this autonomous vehicles have not
[03:19:49.540 --> 03:19:53.380]  come out yet and full and they've got a full engineering drawing there of the sensors that
[03:19:53.380 --> 03:19:57.860]  are going to be there. Isn't that amazing? Stay with us. We're going to have more amazing science
[03:19:57.860 --> 03:20:07.780]  news when we come back. Hey, I wrote the elevator with you, but I don't work on the upper floors.

[03:22:21.460 --> 03:22:26.660]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head
[03:22:26.660 --> 03:22:31.780]  fitness tests. How is this even possible? Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a
[03:22:31.780 --> 03:22:36.980]  special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain-y youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[03:22:36.980 --> 03:22:41.140]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their
[03:22:41.140 --> 03:22:46.260]  achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing in the past. Previously, this drink was
[03:22:46.260 --> 03:22:52.340]  only available to elite military units, but for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens
[03:22:52.340 --> 03:22:58.020]  has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[03:22:58.020 --> 03:23:01.940]  But you must act fast. Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard,
[03:23:01.940 --> 03:23:07.300]  our supply is extremely limited right now. To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens,

[03:24:14.740 --> 03:24:20.100]  to be joining our reporters in Denver. Of course, there's going to be a protest coming up at three
[03:24:20.100 --> 03:24:25.380]  o'clock. I think it's a mountain time. Okay, so it's not going to be happening at the time we
[03:24:25.380 --> 03:24:29.700]  connect with them, but they're going to be there at the steps of the White House, the Capitol
[03:24:29.700 --> 03:24:34.900]  Building in Colorado, in Denver, Colorado. If you want to go to that, it's going to be 3 p.m.
[03:24:34.900 --> 03:24:39.780]  mountain time. That's the West Steps of the Colorado State Capitol in Denver, Colorado. That is a
[03:24:39.780 --> 03:24:46.820]  protest of the disenfranchisement of the GOP voters and the so-called primary that they had,
[03:24:46.820 --> 03:24:51.780]  or the caucus, or I don't know what you call that. I guess it's not an election, it's the selection
[03:24:51.780 --> 03:24:57.140]  that they had. And we're going to talk to them about what happened last night in New York as well.
[03:24:57.140 --> 03:25:02.420]  I want to get back to the amazing technology news here, but before I do, we've got an amazing

[03:25:45.460 --> 03:25:54.180]  45% off of the retail price at InfowarsLife.com. I was just talking about the self-driving cars
[03:25:54.180 --> 03:25:59.540]  and the fact that they're about to get even smarter because they're going to be able to recognize
[03:26:00.260 --> 03:26:06.740]  brake lights and turn signals. And it's amazing when you look at the engineering diagrams here,
[03:26:06.740 --> 03:26:10.900]  where they're patent, where they're going to do this. They're going to do this, folks. These cars
[03:26:10.900 --> 03:26:17.620]  cannot currently recognize brake lights and turn signals, which explains a lot in their driving
[03:26:17.620 --> 03:26:22.580]  record. But look at how complicated this is. They've got all these devices all over this thing. It's
[03:26:22.580 --> 03:26:27.460]  like, you know, you have a pair of eyes. And I guarantee you it's going to be a long time before
[03:26:27.460 --> 03:26:32.180]  this thing can predict better than you can what's going on in the road. They say it's going to enable
[03:26:32.180 --> 03:26:37.300]  these driverless cars to anticipate the movements on the roads. Well, kind of sort of. There's going
[03:26:37.300 --> 03:26:41.860]  to be a lot of other issues involved, too, because there's more than just brake lights and turn
[03:26:41.860 --> 03:26:45.940]  signals. If you're still, if you've been driving and you're still alive, you understand that.
[03:26:45.940 --> 03:26:51.220]  Okay. They say earlier this week, engineers and safety advocates warned self-driving cars are more
[03:26:51.220 --> 03:26:57.540]  likely to hinder than to help public safety because of unsolved technical issues. You think?
[03:26:58.100 --> 03:27:03.140]  Now we see they're starting to work on a patent to recognize turn signals. But of course,
[03:27:03.140 --> 03:27:07.700]  they also point out the same article from Daily Mail. Google is pushing US Congress to give the
[03:27:07.700 --> 03:27:14.340]  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration new powers to grant its special expedited permission.
[03:27:14.340 --> 03:27:20.980]  Now these are exceptions to safety rules. Okay. They keep telling us we're going to end all traffic
[03:27:20.980 --> 03:27:26.100]  accidents. Nobody's going to die on the roads. And yet we need to have the federal government
[03:27:26.740 --> 03:27:31.540]  exercise its authority to preempt the powers of the state and local communities to protect their
[03:27:31.540 --> 03:27:37.700]  people and waive all the safety regulations. How's that? Because why? Because Google wants it
[03:27:37.700 --> 03:27:42.180]  for their profits. But it's not just Google. The government wants it as well. Look at this
[03:27:42.180 --> 03:27:48.340]  article we've got from Curtinamo today on infowars.com. The tech community denounces as ludicrous
[03:27:48.340 --> 03:27:53.700]  and dangerous a new technically illiterate proposal coming from our senators. Now,
[03:27:54.660 --> 03:27:59.540]  there's a lot of connection between this new proposal and what Google is trying to do.
[03:27:59.540 --> 03:28:02.900]  Because you need to understand that we need to stop calling them
[03:28:03.460 --> 03:28:09.460]  self-driving cars. We need to call them the Internet of Things cars. Because they're going
[03:28:09.460 --> 03:28:16.180]  to have the vehicle infrastructure mandated black boxes on your cars so they can tax and track you
[03:28:16.180 --> 03:28:20.660]  and they can control your movement. That's what they want to do. And that's what they're working
[03:28:20.660 --> 03:28:26.340]  on to mandate into our phones, into our computers. They've been doing it for a very long time with
[03:28:26.340 --> 03:28:31.700]  the cooperation of Apple, Microsoft, Google and other corporations. They passed SISPA to remove
[03:28:31.700 --> 03:28:38.180]  their legal liability from you suing them for spying on you and turning the information over
[03:28:38.180 --> 03:28:43.300]  to the law enforcement. So now they're going to go the next step and mandate that these companies
[03:28:43.300 --> 03:28:48.420]  do it and pull it out into the open and tell everybody that, hey, after all these years of
[03:28:48.420 --> 03:28:52.980]  saying, you know, we're not watching you. You're a paranoid conspiracy theorist. If you think
[03:28:52.980 --> 03:28:59.380]  that that camera on your monitor is looking at you, you're crazy. You must be an Alex Jones
[03:28:59.380 --> 03:29:06.020]  show listener. And now we got the FBI bragging about the fact that he does that. Okay, so the
[03:29:06.820 --> 03:29:12.100]  mask is coming off. They're now bragging about it. They're openly talking about it and they're
[03:29:12.100 --> 03:29:18.740]  going to openly do it and mandate it. And these corporations want it that way because they don't
[03:29:18.740 --> 03:29:24.260]  want the liability. That's what SISPA was about. They called it SISA. Okay, so that's really what's
[03:29:24.260 --> 03:29:30.900]  going on. This is the way the people in engineering refer to it. Okay, they say it basically outlaws
[03:29:30.900 --> 03:29:36.180]  and encryption. One other person says this is easily the most ludicrous, dangerous, technically
[03:29:36.180 --> 03:29:42.660]  illiterate proposal I've ever seen. A computer security consultant said this is a work of complete
[03:29:42.660 --> 03:29:48.500]  ignorance. It is a work of Richard Burr and Diane Feinstein who say no one should be above the law.
[03:29:48.500 --> 03:29:55.860]  Well, we're on the march. Stay with us. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:29:59.940 --> 03:30:05.460]  A Connecticut judge has placed herself above the Constitution and above an explicit congressional
[03:30:05.460 --> 03:30:11.220]  law. Judge Barbara Bellis has ruled that Sandy Hook families can sue gun manufacturers,
[03:30:11.220 --> 03:30:17.220]  Remington, Bushmaster and others. But Congress has already explicitly protected firearm
[03:30:17.220 --> 03:30:22.580]  manufacturers from liability and the protection of Lawful Commerce and Arms Act, which says they
[03:30:22.580 --> 03:30:29.540]  will not be held liable for, quote, the harm caused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse
[03:30:29.540 --> 03:30:35.060]  firearm products or ammunition products that function as designed and intended. The act goes
[03:30:35.060 --> 03:30:40.020]  on to explain to people with an anti-gun agenda like Judge Bellis that, quote, the possibility
[03:30:40.020 --> 03:30:46.900]  of imposing liability on an entire industry for harm that is solely caused by others is an abuse
[03:30:46.900 --> 03:30:52.260]  of the legal system, unquote. What's next? Holding Ford liable for a drunk driver killing someone
[03:30:52.260 --> 03:30:56.500]  with the car that they made? If Hillary Clinton has her way, that's what they will do to gun
[03:30:56.500 --> 03:31:02.580]  manufacturers. For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight. When cells become toxic, they die early and aging

[03:33:08.180 --> 03:33:27.540]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and we're going to be joining our reporters
[03:33:27.540 --> 03:33:33.540]  in Denver, Rob Dew and Joe Biggs and my son are there covering the protests. It's going to be
[03:33:33.540 --> 03:33:38.660]  starting at 3 p.m. Mountain Standard Time at the West Steps of the Colorado State Capitol Building
[03:33:38.660 --> 03:33:43.700]  in Denver, Colorado. Of course, they're going to be protesting what happened in the so-called
[03:33:43.700 --> 03:33:48.100]  primary that they had there. We're going to be going to them live in just a moment. As we were
[03:33:48.100 --> 03:33:52.980]  on break, Kit Daniels came in and handed me a story that just went up on infowars.com.
[03:33:52.980 --> 03:34:00.100]  Agenda 21. Developers are planning a car-free 30-story condo in Austin. So here it is. It's
[03:34:00.100 --> 03:34:04.180]  all part of Agenda 21. If you're going to control people's movements, if you're going to track their
[03:34:04.180 --> 03:34:10.980]  movements, if you're going to concentrate people into the cities, you need to make it car-free.
[03:34:10.980 --> 03:34:16.420]  You need to be able to control their movements. And of course, this is, folks, you need to understand
[03:34:16.420 --> 03:34:22.180]  that it is nothing less than all-out war against our freedom. One of the first things you do is
[03:34:22.180 --> 03:34:28.020]  you control the movements of people. You put in additional ways to tax them. Now we're going to
[03:34:28.020 --> 03:34:32.820]  talk to our reporters in Denver. Before we do, I wanted to give you a couple of political stories
[03:34:32.820 --> 03:34:37.220]  that are out here. This is from The Hill, a report that almost half of all super-packed money
[03:34:37.780 --> 03:34:44.900]  came from just 50 donors. Now that explains a lot, doesn't it? Doesn't that explain the selection
[03:34:44.900 --> 03:34:50.500]  of delegates, the careful screening of people that are going to be allowed to participate
[03:34:50.500 --> 03:34:56.740]  in this convoluted and very opaque process that they had there? It was absolutely a ridiculous
[03:34:56.740 --> 03:35:01.860]  process if you take a look at it. Having people stand up and give a 10-minute statement to say,
[03:35:01.860 --> 03:35:07.700]  never Trump, or my number is such-and-such, vote for me. And they didn't put people's names on
[03:35:07.700 --> 03:35:12.580]  the ballot, which is one of the many things that in this article that we have Patrick Halley of
[03:35:12.580 --> 03:35:17.460]  Breitbart, Colorado caucus volunteers are saying ballot errors hurt Trump delegate candidates,
[03:35:17.460 --> 03:35:23.620]  could have violated state rules. They say that it's going to be significant enough that not
[03:35:23.620 --> 03:35:29.380]  only does it violate Republican party rules, but they believe it's going to be challenged legally.
[03:35:29.380 --> 03:35:34.100]  Things like this, for example, the ballot shall include the presidential candidate. Each candidate
[03:35:34.100 --> 03:35:38.660]  for national delegate is pledged to support. Oh, that wasn't there, was it? It also didn't
[03:35:38.660 --> 03:35:43.220]  put their names there either, okay? And of course, they just put numbers there, but then some people
[03:35:43.220 --> 03:35:49.300]  didn't get their numbers put there. They got some numbers listed. Twice others were omitted. So it's
[03:35:49.300 --> 03:35:55.860]  a very, very convoluted system. But here's the bottom line, folks. It's like 50 people
[03:35:55.860 --> 03:36:02.340]  are spending most of the money on the election. 50 donors are half of all the Super PAC money.
[03:36:02.340 --> 03:36:07.140]  This is according to The Washington Post, 50 donors and their families, and they say some of
[03:36:07.140 --> 03:36:14.180]  the biggest contributors so far have been Hedge Fund Manager Tom Steyer, who is fighting climate
[03:36:14.180 --> 03:36:20.500]  change. He has put in 17 million dollars into a Super PAC that supports candidates on climate
[03:36:20.500 --> 03:36:26.740]  change that are fighting climate change that are trying to set up a world governance based on
[03:36:26.740 --> 03:36:32.340]  carbon taxes. Steyer has pledged to spend more than the 74 million dollars he gave during the
[03:36:32.340 --> 03:36:41.540]  2014 elections. He gave 74 million dollars. Now, this is an investment, folks. When Karl Rove
[03:36:41.540 --> 03:36:47.620]  was talking to, had his call, and some people said, hey, it looks like he's softening up to Trump.
[03:36:47.620 --> 03:36:53.220]  What he was doing was he was talking to, and they put it in there, his investors as to how they
[03:36:53.220 --> 03:36:57.860]  could preserve their candidates in office if Donald Trump were at the top of the ticket.
[03:36:58.660 --> 03:37:04.820]  They are investors. They are not doing this because they are passionate about preserving
[03:37:04.820 --> 03:37:10.660]  individual liberty. They're not doing this because they're passionate about maintaining the Constitution
[03:37:10.660 --> 03:37:16.100]  and our Bill of Rights or because they want to overturn unconstitutional mandates like Obamacare.
[03:37:16.100 --> 03:37:20.980]  They're doing this as an investment. So you've got a guy like this who is the heaviest hitter in
[03:37:20.980 --> 03:37:26.100]  all these Super PACs, and only 50 families are providing half of the money to all these Super
[03:37:26.100 --> 03:37:30.820]  PACs. This guy put in 74 million dollars last time. He's going to invest more this time because
[03:37:30.820 --> 03:37:36.340]  he's probably going to be in some of these carbon credit exchanges, as Alex Jones was talking about.
[03:37:36.340 --> 03:37:43.140]  It was Enron that started all of this scheme. And of course Barbara Boxer, not Barbara Boxer,
[03:37:43.140 --> 03:37:48.980]  it was Bill Nye that was talking about that saying, you know, Enron was a criminal organization.
[03:37:48.980 --> 03:37:53.300]  We ought to make people who talk about climate change and deny it. We ought to make them criminals
[03:37:53.300 --> 03:37:58.340]  as well. Now also in that, of course, are the big hitters for Ted Cruz. Other hedge fund managers
[03:37:58.340 --> 03:38:05.220]  like Robert Mercer and Paul Singer are also listed in the big donors. When we look at the delegates,
[03:38:05.220 --> 03:38:10.820]  we've got Ben Carson coming out and defending this. And I'm going to go to Rob in just a
[03:38:10.820 --> 03:38:15.460]  moment. He asked, why do we have the Electoral College anymore? And what he was doing was saying,
[03:38:15.460 --> 03:38:20.820]  I'm not happy with the way these delegates are being selected. And I'm not either. And we've
[03:38:20.820 --> 03:38:25.780]  talked about this many times, but there's a reason that we have the Electoral College besides the
[03:38:25.780 --> 03:38:32.180]  fact that it's not just GOP rules, okay? It's actually in the Constitution. It's the same
[03:38:32.180 --> 03:38:37.460]  reason we have senators and not just representatives. The representatives are supposed to represent the
[03:38:37.460 --> 03:38:42.980]  people. They're proportional based on population. The senators are supposed to represent the states.
[03:38:42.980 --> 03:38:49.060]  Why do you have that? I saw a firsthand example of that in the county that I lived in in North
[03:38:49.060 --> 03:38:54.420]  Carolina. It bordered the university town for the University of North Carolina. They had a lot of
[03:38:54.420 --> 03:39:00.100]  people that moved in and in a high concentration spilled over into this previously rural county
[03:39:00.100 --> 03:39:05.060]  that had nothing but farmers in it. They had had a situation where they had elected representatives
[03:39:05.060 --> 03:39:12.180]  to the county government on a regional basis. But when these people who were political lefty
[03:39:12.180 --> 03:39:16.660]  activists spilled in from the university town, started moving into that county, they changed
[03:39:16.660 --> 03:39:21.700]  the rules. They said, you know what? We're just going to elect all the county commissioners at
[03:39:21.700 --> 03:39:27.220]  large, at large. Guess who got all the county commissioners, that little enclave of people
[03:39:27.220 --> 03:39:32.020]  at the top? What did they do? They enacted restrictions. So these people who had been there
[03:39:32.020 --> 03:39:38.660]  in many cases with their farms for over 100 years, 150 years, could not do anything with their land.
[03:39:38.660 --> 03:39:42.980]  They couldn't subdivide it. They couldn't sell off a portion of it because these people up in
[03:39:42.980 --> 03:39:47.940]  this little corner and this little suburban area were dictating to these people who had been there
[03:39:47.940 --> 03:39:54.180]  for many generations. That's the reason you've got states having power. They wanted to divide power
[03:39:54.180 --> 03:39:58.260]  and not just give it to the people and we didn't want to have just a direct democracy. So again,
[03:39:58.260 --> 03:40:02.500]  Ben Carson's a great guy, but he's really confused about the issue. It doesn't have anything to do
[03:40:02.500 --> 03:40:08.260]  with the Electoral College. It has to do with the crooked rules of the GOP. And so now we go to our
[03:40:08.260 --> 03:40:15.620]  reporters in Denver, Rob Do. Hi, David. Rob Do reporting for Infowars.com just outside of the
[03:40:15.620 --> 03:40:20.260]  capital of Colorado. This is the western side. This is where people will be showing up in about
[03:40:20.260 --> 03:40:27.700]  an hour and a half to protest the GOP's theft of their caucus. Basically the one million people
[03:40:27.700 --> 03:40:33.780]  in this state did not get to vote and select, I guess, choose a president, a presidential candidate
[03:40:33.780 --> 03:40:39.140]  for the Republican Party and they're pissed. So there's at least 500 people pledged on the Facebook
[03:40:39.140 --> 03:40:45.780]  page that are going to be coming here. I got interrupted, Rob, because I would say that they
[03:40:45.780 --> 03:40:50.500]  have turned the caucus into a carcass, haven't they? We're looking at the rotting carcass of
[03:40:50.500 --> 03:40:57.220]  democracy. And I just want to point out, you know, we seem to have this fence wall thing coming
[03:40:57.220 --> 03:41:00.660]  out. Here's, there have some, something they're setting up over here. I don't know what, it might
[03:41:00.660 --> 03:41:05.940]  be a 420 festival. And look, they put up fences everywhere to keep people out. They do believe
[03:41:05.940 --> 03:41:12.740]  in fences, don't they? Or wall at play to keep people out and keep people in. And, you know,
[03:41:12.740 --> 03:41:16.820]  that's, this is the kind of stuff we just need on the border. But yeah, so people are going
[03:41:16.820 --> 03:41:21.220]  to be showing up on these steps. This is the biggest side of the Capitol right here. All
[03:41:21.220 --> 03:41:28.020]  the others are slow. This has a nice big yard. There's a spire over here running up the center.
[03:41:28.020 --> 03:41:32.420]  And it should be pretty interesting of what's going to happen today. So it's going to be about
[03:41:32.420 --> 03:41:36.100]  an hour and a half from yesterday, David. It's going to be about an hour and a half from right
[03:41:36.100 --> 03:41:40.340]  now. Is that right? About an hour? Yeah, I guess we'll plan on hooking up with the nightly news
[03:41:40.340 --> 03:41:46.660]  about 4 o'clock your time, or 5 o'clock their time, 4 o'clock our time. And it should be
[03:41:47.460 --> 03:41:50.260]  in full swing at that point. All right, good. We're going to have that on the
[03:41:50.260 --> 03:41:53.780]  nightly news tonight. Tell us what happened last night in New York at the,
[03:41:55.060 --> 03:41:58.900]  I guess it was the Occupy Wall Street people protesting Trump. We saw some of the videos.
[03:41:58.900 --> 03:42:02.980]  We saw it got pretty hot and heavy with that one guy who's trying to educate them about the
[03:42:02.980 --> 03:42:07.380]  second amendment. They didn't like that. Yeah, they didn't like that. He showed up with his
[03:42:07.380 --> 03:42:11.700]  orange sandwich board passing out flyers saying ISIS is here. You need to be prepared. You need
[03:42:11.700 --> 03:42:17.300]  to know how to fire a gun. And two old ladies started yelling at him at first, and they were
[03:42:17.300 --> 03:42:20.900]  screaming at him, go, go. And then they started, you know, screaming more things at him. And then
[03:42:20.900 --> 03:42:25.140]  this guy comes up, puts his hands up, and it starts bumping him with his chest. And then another
[03:42:25.140 --> 03:42:31.220]  girl who I think Biggs says she's a Black Lives Matter grabbed his cards and threw them. And then
[03:42:31.220 --> 03:42:36.020]  they started pushing him and it escalated from there. But he didn't, I didn't see him attack
[03:42:36.020 --> 03:42:40.580]  anybody first at all. I saw those guys come up and, you know, they don't like those types of
[03:42:40.580 --> 03:42:43.380]  voices. They don't want to hear about the second amendment. They don't want to hear about real
[03:42:43.380 --> 03:42:48.420]  freedom. They want to talk about their fake, canned freedom where nobody's really free. Everybody's
[03:42:48.420 --> 03:42:53.700]  just stuck in a socialist box. Well, you know, he's absolutely right. If there's a
[03:42:53.700 --> 03:42:59.620]  nice attack there in New York, their Black Lives Matter tactics and getting up and chest bumping
[03:42:59.620 --> 03:43:05.460]  these guys isn't going to be very effective as a Rob. No, not very. Yeah, they're going to take
[03:43:05.460 --> 03:43:09.380]  one look at that and probably shoot him if that, you know, happens to have him with a bunch of
[03:43:09.380 --> 03:43:14.340]  ISIS guys. Biggs, come on in here. What was your opinion of what we saw last night? We didn't see,
[03:43:14.340 --> 03:43:18.180]  other than that, we didn't see too many other acts of violence. I know a few protesters got
[03:43:18.180 --> 03:43:23.380]  into the hotel. We weren't actually around for that. It was a big area that the protests were
[03:43:23.380 --> 03:43:27.620]  going on. So we were covering a lot of ground and that happened really quick. That was quickly
[03:43:27.620 --> 03:43:31.540]  squashed by the police. Yeah, I mean, I was actually standing behind the guy as he was moving
[03:43:31.540 --> 03:43:37.140]  forward filming. I was actually standing there with Jesse Waters, a guy from O'Reilly. And all
[03:43:37.140 --> 03:43:41.700]  of a sudden we heard screaming ISIS is here. And I was looking around. I see the guy, he's handing
[03:43:41.700 --> 03:43:45.220]  out flyers up in the air and he goes, you need to learn how to protect yourself. You know,
[03:43:45.220 --> 03:43:48.260]  that's what the Second Amendment's for. You need to go out, learn how to shoot a gun.
[03:43:48.260 --> 03:43:51.380]  And like you said, these people just started jumping up in his face, kind of pushing him,
[03:43:51.380 --> 03:43:55.140]  chest bumping him, all of that. Then one of the top Black Lives Matter girls,
[03:43:55.140 --> 03:43:58.900]  she's been to the White House before, she jumps in his face, starts cussing him out,
[03:43:58.900 --> 03:44:03.220]  starts pushing him again. Some other people do it. Next thing you know, it just push, push, push.
[03:44:03.220 --> 03:44:09.300]  Someone gets decked, hits the ground. As they're pushing the guy back with the Trump hat on,
[03:44:10.180 --> 03:44:14.500]  they almost push him into a guy who's in a wheelchair. You know, I mean, it was completely
[03:44:14.500 --> 03:44:20.340]  crazy. I mean, you guys don't realize that that was all Donald Trump's fault. You know,
[03:44:20.340 --> 03:44:26.260]  like Ted Cruz said, you know, he's provoking all this. He wasn't the provocateur, I don't think.
[03:44:26.260 --> 03:44:30.180]  Certainly what he was doing was far less than what we've seen the Bernie Sanders people do,
[03:44:30.180 --> 03:44:35.460]  going to a Trump rally. And they've been far more aggressive, far more in people's faces.
[03:44:35.460 --> 03:44:38.660]  He wasn't doing anything. He's just standing there saying something. And they were the ones
[03:44:38.660 --> 03:44:42.340]  who got physical. They were the ones who got aggressive with him in spite of what Ted Cruz
[03:44:42.340 --> 03:44:48.420]  would say. I mean, I felt more safe on the Trump protesters side, the pro-Trump guys than I did
[03:44:48.420 --> 03:44:53.380]  in the anti-Trump. I mean, if you, if you, if your views differ for them in any way,
[03:44:53.380 --> 03:44:58.580]  they become violent. They become too verbally abuse you, scream at you, cuss at you. And then
[03:44:58.580 --> 03:45:03.140]  everyone, they're like, get this guy over here, they all just swarm around you and just start
[03:45:03.140 --> 03:45:07.380]  screaming at you. That's not peaceful. You know, when you're suppressing people, because I have
[03:45:07.380 --> 03:45:10.980]  a different viewpoint than you, and you think you can jump in here and like bully people and
[03:45:10.980 --> 03:45:15.300]  push them around. That's completely and totally out of control. That's not what America is supposed
[03:45:15.300 --> 03:45:19.860]  to be. And it sure is not going to happen under my watch. If they're hanging a Donald Trump in
[03:45:19.860 --> 03:45:23.860]  effigy, they had another guy dressed as Donald Trump with a sign saying, you know,
[03:45:23.860 --> 03:45:28.020]  you could beat me for this much with this and with a stick, you know, all kinds of love. Yeah,
[03:45:28.020 --> 03:45:33.060]  very loving coming out from, from, from the liberal left over there in Manhattan. But,
[03:45:33.060 --> 03:45:36.740]  you know, other than that, it didn't get, we saw, we were at the Trump side when this other,
[03:45:36.740 --> 03:45:41.140]  this, uh, this other black, I guess, Bernie supporter showed up and wanted to know he got
[03:45:41.140 --> 03:45:45.620]  triggered by make America great again, because he really was having a problem. I bet you guys
[03:45:45.620 --> 03:45:48.900]  won't punch me. I bet you won't punch me. And the cops came over and they're like, all right,
[03:45:48.900 --> 03:45:54.980]  this is enough, man. And he goes, all right, I hope I see you guys in the alley without your badge
[03:45:54.980 --> 03:45:58.980]  on. He's like, I'm going to start beating that A, you know, and it starts just like cussing at him,
[03:45:58.980 --> 03:46:02.740]  saying he was, he was threatening and, you know, to jump him in an alleyway if you ever saw him
[03:46:02.740 --> 03:46:08.500]  alone. Out of control. That's not peaceful. And the cops were very well reserved and not, I can't
[03:46:08.500 --> 03:46:11.620]  believe he didn't get arrested for doing that because he was pushing the cops. He was verbally
[03:46:11.620 --> 03:46:15.140]  cussing. I was threatening him. And, you know, I didn't see any Trump supporters doing that.
[03:46:15.140 --> 03:46:19.540]  Yeah, that was the thing we noticed when we were in Washington and New York. I mean, the police
[03:46:19.540 --> 03:46:23.860]  there have, they're so experienced with all these different demonstrations. They were pretty chill
[03:46:23.860 --> 03:46:30.180]  in New York and DC. It was in Pennsylvania, where they went totally overboard and crazy. It wasn't
[03:46:30.180 --> 03:46:34.740]  in the big cities like that where they deal with this every day. Yeah, they actually had a pretty
[03:46:34.740 --> 03:46:38.660]  good plan that with the way they kept traffic blown the whole time. I think traffic only
[03:46:38.660 --> 03:46:44.820]  had, that's one point. And, you know, they had areas on either side that were gated off somewhere
[03:46:44.820 --> 03:46:48.340]  you could stand and somewhere that they wanted you to keep moving. And I thought, I actually
[03:46:48.340 --> 03:46:52.340]  thought they did a really good job with, you know, not much notice. One thing's interesting,
[03:46:52.340 --> 03:46:57.140]  though, people like, Oh, this is spontaneous. No, we were, we were there talking with Anthony
[03:46:57.140 --> 03:47:02.260]  yesterday, yesterday. Yeah, it was yesterday. And they stopped with these cabs. They got generators.
[03:47:02.260 --> 03:47:07.140]  They got sound systems. They got printed signs that it was very well organized yesterday. And
[03:47:07.140 --> 03:47:11.300]  I'm sure people, there was definitely at least half the people that were getting paid to be there.
[03:47:11.300 --> 03:47:15.300]  And then they had no idea why they support Bernie Sanders. The same thing we always see.
[03:47:15.300 --> 03:47:19.540]  Yeah. You know, the same thing that Trump's a racist, a bigot, transphobic, blah, blah, blah,
[03:47:19.540 --> 03:47:23.300]  blah, blah, they can even spells, you know, they didn't even know what it meant, but they
[03:47:23.300 --> 03:47:28.260]  used the word. It's the same time, same thing every time, mindless zombies just out there
[03:47:28.260 --> 03:47:32.420]  protesting just to get out there. They have no job. They sit out there and they complain about
[03:47:32.420 --> 03:47:35.940]  not getting work, but they're too lazy to go out and look for a job. There are a lot of
[03:47:35.940 --> 03:47:41.380]  communist organizations. I put a video up called Kami Chan. And that, you know, it's just them
[03:47:41.380 --> 03:47:45.300]  just sitting there chanting. They showed up, started chanting. I ran into a guy with a red
[03:47:45.300 --> 03:47:50.180]  star in his cap. It was actually, you know, he was an infant. He was like, I like you guys.
[03:47:50.180 --> 03:47:54.340]  So I started talking to him about, you know, what he thought socialism was and what are,
[03:47:54.340 --> 03:47:59.460]  you know, no grasp on reality thinking, thinking that socialism is the next evolution after
[03:47:59.460 --> 03:48:03.540]  capitalism. Because once you have this great infrastructure built that you see all around
[03:48:03.540 --> 03:48:08.900]  you, that capitalism built, well, then you just take it for a giant government program to then
[03:48:08.900 --> 03:48:13.380]  dole out to just privilege people, the privileged class. Yeah, we saw how that worked out in
[03:48:13.380 --> 03:48:18.020]  Venezuela. Now they're rationing everything, you know, they don't have food, electricity,
[03:48:18.020 --> 03:48:23.940]  they have no power because he had the kleptocrat there. Hugo Chavez went in and seized everything
[03:48:23.940 --> 03:48:28.100]  and he was eventually thrown out even by other socialists and libertarians because he has a
[03:48:28.100 --> 03:48:32.580]  kleptocrat. I mean, but that's what happens with it. You know, eventually you run out of the things
[03:48:32.580 --> 03:48:36.260]  that you stole from other people because you can't produce anything. You can't even produce
[03:48:36.260 --> 03:48:40.740]  your own energy even though they've got more oil than Saudi Arabia. It's absolutely amazing.
[03:48:40.740 --> 03:48:44.580]  Well, tell us what you're going to be doing. Educated answer. Yeah, that's right. Tell us
[03:48:44.580 --> 03:48:48.580]  what you're going to be doing tomorrow. You're going to be going to Portland, Oregon. There's
[03:48:48.580 --> 03:48:52.900]  state students for Trump meeting. Tell us about that. Right. So we're going to fly
[03:48:52.900 --> 03:48:58.020]  tonight to Portland. We get in around midnight. This is the most I think I've ever traveled
[03:48:58.020 --> 03:49:03.380]  in a 24-hour period. We flew in here this morning. Did get much sleep last night because we were,
[03:49:03.380 --> 03:49:07.140]  you know, kind of jazzed up what was going on, uploading videos and looking at videos and putting
[03:49:07.140 --> 03:49:13.460]  stuff together. And so, yeah, we're going to be in Portland tomorrow at 2 p.m. in Portland time,
[03:49:13.460 --> 03:49:19.860]  specific time. There's going to be a pro-Trump rally for just guys that go to Portland State
[03:49:19.860 --> 03:49:22.660]  University. They want to have a pro-Trump rally. This is their second gathering because their
[03:49:22.660 --> 03:49:28.260]  first one was shut down by a bunch of protesters and a bunch of tyrants. They weren't protesters.
[03:49:28.260 --> 03:49:33.220]  They were tyrants. These were anti-free speech, you know, thugs who just don't want anybody else
[03:49:33.220 --> 03:49:38.820]  to have an opinion other than their magic opinion, which is, you know, only they get to speak.
[03:49:38.820 --> 03:49:42.580]  That's right. Only they get to have opinions. Only they get to walk around with their metaflags,
[03:49:42.580 --> 03:49:46.180]  which is Hispanic Glucox clan. You know, look into what that is all about.
[03:49:46.900 --> 03:49:50.420]  Well, we talked to them yesterday. And of course, that should be an interesting thing. I hope you
[03:49:50.420 --> 03:49:55.700]  guys took your brain force with you with all this overall matters that you're doing and traveling
[03:49:55.700 --> 03:50:00.820]  from one of the country, New York yesterday, Portland tomorrow. And today, you're in Denver.
[03:50:00.820 --> 03:50:04.020]  You guys are working really hard. I hope you do have some brain force there. If you don't,

[03:50:07.700 --> 03:50:10.900]  They would get it delivered overnight and have it meet at Portland.
[03:50:10.900 --> 03:50:15.380]  There you go. Okay. All right, guys, take care. We'll be following what you're going to do. And
[03:50:15.380 --> 03:50:21.860]  again, they're going to be at the Denver protest. That's going to be in about an hour, a little
[03:50:21.860 --> 03:50:24.980]  over an hour, an hour and 10 minutes. Yeah, three o'clock central. It's going to start. Yeah,
[03:50:24.980 --> 03:50:29.380]  three o'clock central and then three to six mountain time, three to six mountain time.
[03:50:29.380 --> 03:50:33.300]  That's right. Three, three o'clock local time. They're in Denver mountain standard time. That's
[03:50:33.300 --> 03:50:37.940]  going to be on the West steps of the Colorado State Capitol building. Thank you so much, Rob

[03:53:00.260 --> 03:53:05.780]  shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego. The old guys in the unit have turned the
[03:53:05.780 --> 03:53:10.820]  tables and are now destroying the young books in head to head fitness tests. How is this even
[03:53:10.820 --> 03:53:15.540]  possible? Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a
[03:53:15.540 --> 03:53:20.420]  doctor formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens. Patriot Power Greens has
[03:53:20.420 --> 03:53:25.300]  been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles,
[03:53:25.300 --> 03:53:30.900]  and lack of energy a thing in the past. Previously this drink was only available to elite military
[03:53:30.900 --> 03:53:36.980]  units but for a limited time the creator Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free
[03:53:36.980 --> 03:53:42.660]  sample packs specifically for our conservative friends. But you must act fast. Due to the high
[03:53:42.660 --> 03:53:47.780]  demand from members of the Coast Guard our supply is extremely limited right now. To claim your free
[03:53:47.780 --> 03:53:58.740]  samples of Patriot Power Greens go to greens75.com. That's greens75.com. Greens75.com.
[03:54:07.940 --> 03:54:11.700]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and of course we have some new news out
[03:54:11.700 --> 03:54:16.580]  of North Carolina. Something that as they have these bathroom wars going on in North Carolina,
[03:54:16.580 --> 03:54:24.260]  I believe this is going to bring the people of North Carolina to their knees. Ringo Starr has
[03:54:24.260 --> 03:54:30.340]  canceled his performance in North Carolina. And when I told that to my kids I said Ringo who?
[03:54:30.340 --> 03:54:35.780]  I said no no not the who man the Beatles you know Ringo. Remember him? His audience is now
[03:54:36.500 --> 03:54:42.020]  64 I guess. But I guess the question we were talking about this my wife said well that's
[03:54:42.020 --> 03:54:47.380]  interesting point because you know we got all these people like Bruce Springsteen and Ringo
[03:54:47.380 --> 03:54:54.260]  Starr canceling their concerts in North Carolina. Why can't they be sued? You know just like the
[03:54:54.260 --> 03:54:59.140]  people who don't bake cakes or take pictures you know they have a public business so they have to
[03:54:59.140 --> 03:55:04.660]  perform they have to perform their service. So why can these people who have already many of them
[03:55:04.660 --> 03:55:10.420]  sold their tickets why can't they be sued because they've now decided that they don't want to go
[03:55:10.420 --> 03:55:17.300]  through with this public performance this public business. I guess it's because sexual preference
[03:55:17.860 --> 03:55:24.180]  Trump's religious preference doesn't it? That's what the left is telling us but there's not anything
[03:55:24.180 --> 03:55:29.780]  about sexual preference in the Constitution. There is however something about religious preference
[03:55:30.420 --> 03:55:35.460]  but it doesn't even get to that point and there's not just the the Hollywood types that are there.
[03:55:35.460 --> 03:55:41.620]  We've also got Deutsche Bank has now halted its expansion that would have meant 250 jobs in Kerry
[03:55:41.620 --> 03:55:47.860]  because of the law they say. And I guess this is the first time Deutsche Bank has really paid any
[03:55:47.860 --> 03:55:52.100]  attention to any law and I'm going to tell you about that in just a moment. Real quickly though
[03:55:52.100 --> 03:55:56.340]  we've got some of the presidential candidates weighing in. John Kasich says well I think it's
[03:55:56.340 --> 03:56:01.780]  the wrong thing. I think we ought to let people come into these women's bathrooms and boys
[03:56:01.780 --> 03:56:07.940]  showering with girls. He didn't actually say that. He said that he thought we should do this out of
[03:56:07.940 --> 03:56:15.540]  concerns for discrimination, LGBT discrimination. Now the Lieutenant Governor pointed out as he was
[03:56:16.500 --> 03:56:21.300]  explaining what's going on to people who aren't really following this too closely like John Kasich.
[03:56:21.300 --> 03:56:26.260]  He said this is a defensive measure designed to prevent to preserve a common sense status quo.
[03:56:26.260 --> 03:56:31.540]  This is a new American covering this. He said there's a giant loophole that they created
[03:56:31.540 --> 03:56:37.140]  in this ordinance that would allow any person to enter any bathroom at any time. So a man could
[03:56:37.140 --> 03:56:41.620]  enter a woman's bathroom, a woman's locker, a shower facility, they could enter a girl's
[03:56:41.620 --> 03:56:47.300]  bathroom, a girl's locker. The Charlotte ordinance said the business community also had to comply
[03:56:47.300 --> 03:56:52.100]  with this ordinance. But of course performers don't have to honor the tickets that they've
[03:56:52.100 --> 03:56:57.540]  sold. They can just cancel it at their discrimination. They said it was sex discrimination to have a
[03:56:57.540 --> 03:57:03.780]  men's room and to have a woman's room labeled on your doors. Now we had Ted Cruz weigh into this
[03:57:03.780 --> 03:57:09.940]  as well and he is on the right side of this issue. He said bathroom bills are perfectly reasonable.
[03:57:09.940 --> 03:57:17.220]  Yeah, I think it is. I think it is absolutely crazy that they would have an issue with this.
[03:57:17.220 --> 03:57:23.540]  Of course we've had many of our friends putting stuff on Facebook from North Carolina. Some of
[03:57:23.540 --> 03:57:27.780]  them would say, well, you know, I never thought I would have to have a birth certificate to go
[03:57:27.780 --> 03:57:31.780]  into the bathroom. Well, you know, you don't really need a birth certificate. And these are
[03:57:31.780 --> 03:57:37.060]  typically our Democrat friends who never thought that the president should need a birth certificate
[03:57:37.060 --> 03:57:42.100]  either. But I think we definitely need one for him. We don't need one, however, to get into the
[03:57:42.100 --> 03:57:47.300]  bathrooms. Just the law said that you go into the bathroom or the locker room that matches the
[03:57:47.300 --> 03:57:50.980]  gender of your birth certificate. That's just a legal way of saying we're not going to let
[03:57:50.980 --> 03:57:57.220]  men or boys go into the girl's shower. Okay, that's all that amounts to. And if you're confused as to
[03:57:57.220 --> 03:58:01.300]  which one that applies to you, just look down your pants, you might be able to figure it out.
[03:58:01.300 --> 03:58:05.620]  But when I talk about Deutsche Bank, remember, these are the people that a year ago got the
[03:58:05.620 --> 03:58:12.500]  biggest fine for live war manipulation, manipulating the currency markets. Now they've been admitted
[03:58:12.500 --> 03:58:17.060]  that they manipulated the silver market. This is a very interesting story from zero hedge. And I
[03:58:17.060 --> 03:58:21.540]  wish I had more time to talk about this because what they did was it was a lawsuit and somehow
[03:58:21.540 --> 03:58:26.500]  magically overnight, it just went away. And they said, we're going to pay money to keep this quiet
[03:58:26.500 --> 03:58:31.460]  and this information may be useful in the other lawsuits against the other usual suspects. Join
[03:58:31.460 --> 03:58:47.860]  us tonight, 7 central 8 p.m. Eastern for the nightly news.
