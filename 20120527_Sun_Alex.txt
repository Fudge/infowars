[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:30.000 --> 00:50.000]  We are live ladies and gentlemen and broadcasting worldwide blasting out on the MNFM dial, Global Shortwave and the internet of course at infowars.com
[00:50.000 --> 01:02.000]  And we are on the road here. We will have open phones for much of the broadcast today. At least the entire second hour. I'm really commit to doing that.
[01:02.000 --> 01:16.000]  Aaron Dykes is going to be popping in as well. It sounds like he's running the generator too. Or is that just the air conditioner?
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.000]  No, I don't think that's the air conditioner. Doing that big rumble now that they actually turned the music off. I think the generator just kicked in.
[01:23.000 --> 01:31.000]  Which is fine. I mean they got an audio gate on the system and stuff, but the air conditioner wasn't making a rumble that big earlier.
[01:31.000 --> 01:39.000]  I'm pretty sure the generator pumped on. Or he's pumping something out. Let's just not do that during broadcast. Let's do that at the end of the show. Thank you.
[01:39.000 --> 01:47.000]  Ok, well as long as you're good on your end, I feel like I'm doing a radio broadcast from an airplane or something. This whole 12 year old bus we got, I love it.
[01:47.000 --> 01:57.000]  And it's like the space shuttle that's got so many switches and things. I just noticed as soon as I went live, a rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble.
[01:57.000 --> 02:06.780]  thing started and is that just AC or what is that I feel a groaning going on
[02:06.780 --> 02:11.760]  because it just got louder huh it doesn't matter ladies and gentlemen this
[02:11.760 --> 02:16.360]  is real radio real radio broadcasting world-wide we're also going out on
[02:16.360 --> 02:24.280]  you stream right now and well I haven't plunged into the news yet have I but I
[02:24.280 --> 02:31.240]  will I will be doing that coming up here today and boy is there a lot of crazy
[02:31.240 --> 02:34.400]  news I normally cover news the weird unless it
[02:34.400 --> 02:40.000]  pertains to human behavior and is a window into the overall psychology of
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.160]  how the globalists are controlling us naked man killed by police near McArthur
[02:45.160 --> 02:52.320]  causeway was eating face-off victim it was a scene as creepy as Hannibal
[02:52.320 --> 02:56.800]  Lecter or day of the dead I would add one man was shot to death by Mammy police
[02:56.800 --> 03:00.520]  and another man is fighting for his life after he was attacked and his face
[03:00.520 --> 03:08.360]  allegedly half eaten by a naked man on McArthur causeway off ramp Saturday well
[03:08.360 --> 03:13.160]  you know the answer to this is ban teeth England wants to ban knives because
[03:13.160 --> 03:16.080]  people are getting stabbed you know they want to ban guns because people use
[03:16.080 --> 03:21.080]  them well the answer is ban teeth and if somebody ever punches anyone out of six
[03:21.080 --> 03:25.920]  and a half or seven plus billion people now cut all arms off worldwide and if
[03:25.920 --> 03:32.000]  anyone ever rapes a woman cut off every man's genitals on earth that is the
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.680]  logic they try to sell us for victim disarmament no because there are people
[03:36.680 --> 03:39.960]  like this kind of trying to say we believe it was cocaine induced psychosis
[03:39.960 --> 03:43.000]  though we're not sure yeah cocaine they pick some illegal drug not that I say
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.960]  cocaine's even good it's certainly bad for you but controlled but compared to
[03:45.960 --> 03:50.840]  other substances that they push on the public big pharma Prozac the
[03:50.840 --> 03:55.400]  serotonin reuptake inhibitors all the other stuff I mean I read the police
[03:55.400 --> 03:58.920]  cases in the news every day 90 plus percent of the time people doing crazy
[03:58.920 --> 04:03.640]  stuff are either on psychotropic's that are over-the-counter or prescription
[04:03.640 --> 04:07.720]  excuse me or they're hopped up with over-the-counter stuff mixed together that
[04:07.720 --> 04:12.880]  makes them go crazy or they're on stuff like PCP you know horse tranquilizers
[04:12.880 --> 04:18.280]  and this could certainly do that but I'm not gonna spend all day on that
[04:18.280 --> 04:24.120]  whenever we get back from this first break I want to get into decoration day
[04:24.120 --> 04:28.960]  that's the real name of memorial day I've got some comments on that and the fact
[04:28.960 --> 04:32.200]  that our military that certainly you could say once fought for the Republic
[04:32.200 --> 04:35.760]  has been turned into a wholly owned subsidiary of the globalist we're
[04:35.760 --> 04:39.400]  gonna get into huge news they're openly announcing Congress set to vote they
[04:39.400 --> 04:42.680]  say they have the votes to hand the internet DARPA created the US created
[04:42.680 --> 04:46.720]  over the UN and they're calling for internet IDs and taxes at Bilderberg
[04:46.720 --> 04:52.240]  this year that's big news and a lot more straight ahead stay with us I'm Alex
[04:52.240 --> 04:59.800]  Jones of info wars dot com back in 60 seconds sick of the globalist you

[06:20.480 --> 06:28.360]  from deep in the heart of FEMA region 6 Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's
[06:28.360 --> 06:31.720]  Alex Jones
[06:31.720 --> 06:44.200]  I am honored to be your host I am honored to be in America on this eve of
[06:44.200 --> 06:50.720]  decoration day you know it as Memorial Day thank you so much for joining us
[06:50.720 --> 06:57.240]  today as we transmit worldwide against tyranny I am somewhere in Arkansas what
[06:57.240 --> 07:03.120]  is this Arkadelfia yes we're in Arkadelfia at a little stop here in the
[07:03.120 --> 07:08.760]  info wars information warfare wagon hurtling down the road as soon as this
[07:08.760 --> 07:11.440]  transmission is complete we can actually do it as we go down the road but it's too
[07:11.440 --> 07:17.800]  noisy towards our final destination on this trip and that of course is Chantilly
[07:17.800 --> 07:23.480]  Virginia which means the lace in the French and I am going to be there for
[07:23.480 --> 07:28.800]  four days Thursday through Sunday actually be there early we get there
[07:28.800 --> 07:32.960]  tomorrow night as I case where the Bilderberg group is going to be meeting
[07:32.960 --> 07:39.160]  we've seen three articles in the front page the last week and a half of huge
[07:39.160 --> 07:43.840]  online publications like Politico covering Bilderberg admitting that they
[07:43.840 --> 07:47.040]  basically run the planet we've seen Washington Post making jokes about how
[07:47.040 --> 07:52.840]  they basically vet presidents and vice presidents and prime ministers we have
[07:52.840 --> 07:57.480]  seen so long and a whole bunch of other publications you know three or four
[07:57.480 --> 08:00.880]  years ago if you went to a search engine like Google news which they now admit is
[08:00.880 --> 08:04.520]  the NSA told you that years ago about seven years ago we broke that we got
[08:04.520 --> 08:08.800]  death threats over that now they admit it's in SA front oh the government can't
[08:08.800 --> 08:13.320]  run big corporations oh unless they do it secretly now all that is out in the
[08:13.320 --> 08:16.520]  open there's a big article today the EU calls it the biggest private
[08:16.520 --> 08:19.960]  intelligence network in the world well it's not private neither is Microsoft
[08:19.960 --> 08:24.960]  look into that they're all part of this Bankster takeover and to get around the
[08:24.960 --> 08:31.200]  antitrust laws of 1906 they break things up into subsidiaries but the point is
[08:31.200 --> 08:35.200]  there is a global elite they are nefarious they do not want a free market
[08:35.200 --> 08:39.120]  they are monopoly men they fund fascist and communist anything that destroys
[08:39.120 --> 08:42.600]  free market they are threatened by independent wealth they are the
[08:42.600 --> 08:48.480]  antithesis of the American free market constitutional due process system so if
[08:48.480 --> 08:51.880]  you claim you're an American on Memorial Day coming up tomorrow or on the
[08:51.880 --> 08:55.040]  fourth of July coming up in a month if you claim you love what this country
[08:55.040 --> 08:59.800]  stands for then you better find out what it actually means to be an American
[08:59.800 --> 09:03.600]  and why we were the light of the world the example of Liberty Worldwide now the
[09:03.600 --> 09:08.160]  example of tyranny about a month and a half ago the Communist Chinese party
[09:08.160 --> 09:11.520]  that kills hundreds of thousands of people a year in death camps on record
[09:11.520 --> 09:16.160]  building building things you buy at Slave Martin places like that said we're
[09:16.160 --> 09:19.400]  now going to put on the books what we did secretly we can secretly arrest
[09:19.400 --> 09:24.920]  disappear torture kill people off of the American NDAA National Defense
[09:24.920 --> 09:29.400]  Authorization Act and now this week they're trying to supplement the NDAA
[09:29.400 --> 09:33.600]  with more house and Senate funding it's past the house past the house what
[09:33.600 --> 09:38.840]  Wednesday listen to this carefully to allow the CIA and Pentagon to spend your
[09:38.840 --> 09:45.920]  tax money domestically your tax money domestically going after the American
[09:45.920 --> 09:49.920]  people with quote disinformation and lies that was in the Washington Post they're
[09:49.920 --> 09:53.360]  like it's a good thing to use disinformation and deception against
[09:53.360 --> 09:57.360]  the American people and again the globalist attached their whole New
[09:57.360 --> 10:03.560]  World Order crony capitalist anti-free market monopoly man agenda on the troops
[10:03.560 --> 10:07.760]  through like support the troops launch wars in more countries the troops wanted
[10:07.760 --> 10:12.160]  support the troops make them serve five six seven tears by the way I have it
[10:12.160 --> 10:17.200]  here in my tabs on my I'm so accustomed to having the printouts because I can
[10:17.200 --> 10:21.200]  just thumb through them but I've got it here in my 30 or 40 tabs only got 37 tabs
[10:21.200 --> 10:24.640]  to be correct that's a low news day it's actually a big news day but I just am
[10:24.640 --> 10:28.360]  not accustomed to having all my tabs on the computer I've got to dig it up or
[10:28.360 --> 10:32.240]  just search it yourself on this eve of decoration day as it was known now
[10:32.240 --> 10:38.720]  Memorial Day that they're saying new prosthesis or prosthetics that's
[10:38.720 --> 10:43.960]  that's artificial limbs allows troops to get back on the battlefield so now when
[10:43.960 --> 10:48.080]  you get an armored leg blown off they make you go back into combat in fact
[10:48.080 --> 10:53.240]  these sergeant bales that reportedly killed 19 people they put on Prozac by
[10:53.240 --> 10:56.360]  the way putting them into a psychopathic mindset they admit on the insert it
[10:56.360 --> 10:59.960]  makes you have second psychopathic breaks he'd been in three hardcore combat
[10:59.960 --> 11:03.160]  tears was going back to his fourth he had been gung-ho but he said look I don't
[11:03.160 --> 11:08.640]  want to go back his foot was 90% blown off he had an artificial foot did
[11:08.640 --> 11:12.880]  you know that and they made him go back hey you serve three turns in Iraq and
[11:12.880 --> 11:16.280]  Afghanistan you see a bunch of your buddies killed your marriage has been
[11:16.280 --> 11:20.040]  broken up by this you don't want to go back go on Prozac and in Fedemans that's
[11:20.040 --> 11:25.600]  what they put the troops on 110,000 of our troops over 10% are on multiple
[11:25.600 --> 11:29.560]  psychotropic slash speed drugs psychotropic and speed drugs on record
[11:29.560 --> 11:32.920]  look it up just everything I say type it into a search engine that's Washington
[11:32.920 --> 11:38.000]  Post associated press Reuters remember a few months ago 110,000 of on this he was
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.520]  admittedly on this I'm not saying we did was okay but you can't put a guy put on
[11:41.520 --> 11:46.240]  psychotropic and in battle stress in jail but they don't want the big pharma to
[11:46.240 --> 11:50.040]  get in trouble so here on the day before Memorial Day I want to point this out
[11:50.040 --> 11:55.240]  feeding the troops blindly into wars for opium and oil and gas pipelines and no
[11:55.240 --> 11:59.720]  bid contracts is not patriotism it is the height of hating the troops so the
[11:59.720 --> 12:03.080]  globalists with a scyop attach all their murderous activities all their
[12:03.080 --> 12:06.960]  unconstitutional activities all the horrible things they do they attach all
[12:06.960 --> 12:12.360]  that onto the train onto the engine of the troops and make their entire evil
[12:12.360 --> 12:16.960]  agenda look good so he had his foot almost completely blown off he had the
[12:16.960 --> 12:21.120]  heel and the bone coming into it so he had to stick that in the boot and he had
[12:21.120 --> 12:26.160]  to run around on that me so he's on all these drugs and psychotropic and then
[12:26.160 --> 12:31.360]  his buddies his best friend gets blown up that day by an improvised explosive
[12:31.360 --> 12:36.120]  device he happens to be in the convoy behind it responds sees his buddy with
[12:36.120 --> 12:41.160]  his half his body blown off he's on psychotropic hallucinating that's in a
[12:41.160 --> 12:45.480]  hallucinogen class sneaks out that night and kills 19 people children burning
[12:45.480 --> 12:51.000]  them of gasoline shooting people in and just a blood-fueled rage now that's
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.240]  what you need to understand going on ladies and gentlemen and now they're
[12:54.240 --> 12:58.800]  saying oh the prostheses are so good you just lost an arm you just lost a leg
[12:58.800 --> 13:06.280]  I looked this up in World War two only people like Audie Murphy served tutors my
[13:06.280 --> 13:10.640]  grandfathers especially the one that was in flying B-17s and then also flying
[13:10.640 --> 13:17.120]  coffins the Liberators he served as his catch-22 missions and then what you know
[13:17.120 --> 13:20.480]  was just in the Army Air Corps after that on the ground in Italy but first
[13:20.480 --> 13:26.240]  North Africa then Italy and I mean I know he never talked about it but
[13:26.240 --> 13:29.200]  definitely showed signs of post-traumatic you know stressing things
[13:29.200 --> 13:33.120]  like that after he came home from stories I heard and you know things like
[13:33.120 --> 13:37.960]  that and think about serving not one two three four five six seven eight
[13:37.960 --> 13:41.360]  tours remember a few years ago on the Sunday show a guy called any said how
[13:41.360 --> 13:44.720]  dare you say that people serving five tours that's not true you want anti-
[13:44.720 --> 13:48.200]  patriotic person and I went and looked it up that was six years seven years in
[13:48.200 --> 13:51.680]  the end of the Afghan war there are people that had served six tours now
[13:51.680 --> 13:57.840]  ten and a half years in the Afghan war guess how many people the percentage
[13:57.840 --> 14:02.960]  over five percent have served more than seven tours the Pentagon doesn't deny
[14:02.960 --> 14:09.440]  go look it up a large number I was looking up a few weeks ago have served
[14:09.440 --> 14:12.840]  more than four tours something like thirty something percent ladies and
[14:12.840 --> 14:16.320]  gentlemen that is incredible I was flying back from a video shoot for
[14:16.320 --> 14:22.600]  Jesse Ventura's TV show a few months ago with a Air Force MP who was explaining
[14:22.600 --> 14:25.880]  all the combat they see because the zones they're in and I said how many
[14:25.880 --> 14:29.720]  tours you've been he said I'm starting my eighth tour and he was only back from
[14:29.720 --> 14:34.680]  Afghanistan to fly back on the airplane to Austin with one of his other MP
[14:34.680 --> 14:39.480]  buddies that have been blown up by an IED and provides explosive device to take
[14:39.480 --> 14:43.400]  the coffin and bury it at Fort Hood and Austin cops remember that I don't know
[14:43.400 --> 14:46.480]  four or five months ago actually now time flies because they came and picked it up
[14:46.480 --> 14:49.960]  at Austin Berkstrom and they had a little motorcade for which is which is a
[14:49.960 --> 14:55.280]  good thing to do the point here is is that we need to remember on Memorial Day
[14:55.280 --> 15:00.120]  which was Decorations Day when women would go out to the gravesites and put
[15:00.120 --> 15:07.040]  up little American flags and flowers and things like that we should remember as
[15:07.040 --> 15:12.480]  all of this is coming up that it came out in Bloomberg last year in AP as well
[15:12.480 --> 15:18.600]  that 12 years ago Prudential and all the other big insurance companies met the
[15:18.600 --> 15:23.160]  Big Den met with the Department of Defense and made a deal that they could
[15:23.160 --> 15:26.120]  quote take death benefits you know they take money under your check if you sign
[15:26.120 --> 15:30.200]  on for years in the military to put it into a death benefit life insurance to
[15:30.200 --> 15:34.480]  make a deal to steal the life insurance from the widows and widowers when they
[15:34.480 --> 15:38.600]  die and see if you talk about that it's not patriotic patriotic's going to a
[15:38.600 --> 15:43.560]  football game getting drunk saluting the flag saying you support the troops saying
[15:43.560 --> 15:46.880]  you care about them meanwhile you make them serve five six seven eight tours
[15:46.880 --> 15:51.120]  with arms and legs blown off and you put them on drugs and they come back home
[15:51.120 --> 15:54.560]  and kill their families and the system says get turn our guns in because
[15:54.560 --> 15:57.160]  troops are coming home with post-traumatic stress disorder they give
[15:57.160 --> 16:00.720]  them hallucinogens and they go crazy we'll be back stay with us hi this is
[16:00.720 --> 16:04.640]  Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[16:04.640 --> 16:08.160]  and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real
[16:08.160 --> 16:12.160]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's
[16:12.160 --> 16:15.600]  true seeds about perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[16:15.600 --> 16:19.520]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[16:19.520 --> 16:23.640]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a

[21:23.760 --> 21:27.120]  and then on for hundreds of years fought for liberty and freedom in many
[21:27.120 --> 21:33.840]  cases but in every other nation North Korea Mexico areas in Africa Europe we
[21:33.840 --> 21:37.520]  all know militaries and police become agents of tyranny so we have to keep
[21:37.520 --> 21:41.640]  them in check as our founding fathers said but what about the bureaucrats what
[21:41.640 --> 21:45.360]  about the bankers who've gotten the world to accept their fiat currency or
[21:45.360 --> 21:50.280]  taking over the planet coming up after Aaron Dykes comes up in the next
[21:50.280 --> 21:54.640]  segment and gives you a report a big boil down on Bilderberg 2012 and the fact
[21:54.640 --> 21:57.720]  that the dams finally broken on mainstream media coverage and what a big
[21:57.720 --> 22:04.400]  deal this is and then your phone calls at 877-789 Alex that's 877-789-2539
[22:04.400 --> 22:11.640]  that is all coming up today but I look at well we reported early in the week and
[22:11.640 --> 22:15.400]  it went on drudge report dot com and went viral the info wars dot com story
[22:15.400 --> 22:19.720]  that one of the heads of the Bilderberg group openly called for internet IDs
[22:19.720 --> 22:26.120]  internet taxation internet censorship for the UN to take control of the internet
[22:26.120 --> 22:30.920]  and be able to censor it and tax it that is now in the Hill newspaper it is now
[22:30.920 --> 22:39.680]  in a bunch of other big publications as of this Sunday the 27th day of May again
[22:39.680 --> 22:44.800]  we tell you about things days weeks months years before so there it is we
[22:44.800 --> 22:47.960]  told you back in the late 90s of the derivatives will be pumped up into the
[22:47.960 --> 22:51.800]  quadrillion level now it's doubled that I've been saying 1.5 quadrillion now it's
[22:51.800 --> 22:58.800]  2 quadrillion that's 2,000 trillion of fake Fiat they then tell the Greeks 92
[22:58.800 --> 23:02.880]  percent to 93 percent of the debt is not yours your last prime minister former
[23:02.880 --> 23:07.920]  Goldman Sachs executive shines you on to the too big to fail derivatives globally
[23:07.920 --> 23:12.480]  just like Americans have been signed on to it even more we need to cut raise your
[23:12.480 --> 23:17.680]  taxes cut your benefits and have a 20% VAT on top of everything to pay
[23:17.680 --> 23:20.880]  foreign private bankers and we're going to take your national parks and your
[23:20.880 --> 23:25.120]  islands and hand them over to private individuals who paid off your government
[23:25.120 --> 23:29.520]  leaders to sign on to it and the head of the IMF is in the news today saying pay
[23:29.520 --> 23:34.960]  your fair share the French head of the IMF international monetary fund and and
[23:34.960 --> 23:38.600]  the general public's like well them them Greeks are lazy now it's the Spanish
[23:38.600 --> 23:43.000]  then it's the Italians it's the Irish it's the Icelanders but the Icelanders
[23:43.000 --> 23:46.920]  what a couple years ago with the first they were told they they owed over a
[23:46.920 --> 23:51.880]  hundred billion dollars for a country of 390 something thousand it's not even
[23:51.880 --> 23:56.400]  40,000 not even 400,000 people and most of them live in their capital of
[23:56.400 --> 24:01.440]  Racky of that it's like 940 something thousand live there and you know a little
[24:01.440 --> 24:05.320]  bit more 40 or 50,000 live in other other parts I mean look up the numbers of
[24:05.320 --> 24:10.000]  Racky of that can Iceland but they actually protested and demonstrated and
[24:10.000 --> 24:15.360]  boycotted the banks and did strikes for a year plush and then all the ministers
[24:15.360 --> 24:19.200]  had to resign who'd been lying to me it turned out again in the case of their
[24:19.200 --> 24:27.000]  country 92% the same in most countries of the debt was owed by the very private
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.920]  central banks that own our fellow reserve our fellow reserve is not federal
[24:29.920 --> 24:35.280]  show they're the only country to beat it and if Greece beats it and simply
[24:35.280 --> 24:41.120]  monetizes their debt it's less than 10% and and says too big to fail you are
[24:41.120 --> 24:46.640]  gonna fail and those big banks go belly up it's gonna start in Italy and Spain
[24:46.640 --> 24:52.040]  I told you five years ago it would start in Iceland then in Greece Ireland
[24:52.040 --> 24:56.920]  Spain they call them the pigs for every reason those particular countries when
[24:56.920 --> 25:00.480]  it comes to debt they're called on the financial publications or the hogs
[25:00.480 --> 25:05.920]  technically in in Latin it translates to hogs and it's exactly as we said and
[25:05.920 --> 25:13.200]  why is that we have the insiders like Mark Fauber and Max Kaiser and the
[25:13.200 --> 25:18.160]  former head of policy at the Treasury dr. Paul Craig Roberts and Bob Chapman
[25:18.160 --> 25:22.160]  by the way people keep asking why is Bob Chapman on the air I knew months ago he
[25:22.160 --> 25:27.200]  had health problems three months ago and I didn't want to stress him out Bob is
[25:27.200 --> 25:32.160]  like 76 77 international forecaster.com I didn't want to stress him out keep
[25:32.160 --> 25:34.680]  having him on every Friday so I said well just when you feel good you come on
[25:34.680 --> 25:37.920]  and then we got the message about a month ago he can't do interviews anymore
[25:37.920 --> 25:40.920]  for now so pray for Bob Chapman I wasn't gonna talk about that people are like
[25:40.920 --> 25:44.640]  you piece of filth don't have Bob Chapman on anymore let's just prove your traitorous
[25:44.640 --> 25:48.800]  piece of guy bitch well I don't give people's private info out so I just
[25:48.800 --> 25:52.360]  didn't respond to that like where is the Friday update where is it just didn't
[25:52.360 --> 25:56.360]  say anything because it was private but he put a thing out like a month ago so I
[25:56.360 --> 26:00.520]  can now say it but you don't know who he is he's a great guy helped publish an
[26:00.520 --> 26:05.040]  undare call a conspiracy put out the Gary Allen report 30 40 years ago more than
[26:05.040 --> 26:09.800]  40 years ago exposed in the globalist Gary Allen his son started Politico by
[26:09.800 --> 26:13.520]  the way just a funny thing that here's his dad all knowing about the New World
[26:13.520 --> 26:17.040]  Order and then the Politico acts like it's liberal but they're breaking the dam
[26:17.040 --> 26:20.840]  on on Bell on Bilderberg news you got to think maybe maybe they've got a tinge of
[26:20.840 --> 26:25.000]  conscience I know last year Bilderberg actually called us remember that not
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.880]  Bilderberg Politico actually called us about Bilderberg by the way that's where
[26:29.880 --> 26:34.120]  I'm headed that's why I'm on the road okay we're gonna start opening the phones
[26:34.120 --> 26:37.640]  up not in the next segment when Aaron Dykes comes in with a cogent focus
[26:37.640 --> 26:44.040]  report but in the segment after that and then into the second hour on this
[26:44.040 --> 26:49.560]  abbreviated Sunday transmission but then throughout the week we're gonna have a
[26:49.560 --> 26:54.200]  live broadcast for you we're doing a rebroadcast of Lord Monkinen studio last
[26:54.200 --> 26:59.200]  week at some other big interviews tomorrow on Memorial Day but we're

[27:23.920 --> 27:28.240]  we're gonna be broadcasting on the ground as world leaders arrive as the
[27:28.240 --> 27:31.480]  Secret Service drives by at the Bilderberg Hotel they're meeting at
[27:31.480 --> 27:35.920]  pointing machine guns at us like four years ago every four years they come to
[27:35.920 --> 27:39.920]  North America and four years ago they came to the same Marriott Conference Center
[27:39.920 --> 27:45.040]  in Chantilly Virginia and there was Hillary there was Obama the media was
[27:45.040 --> 27:49.280]  saying where are they we know where they were and this year it's finally
[27:49.280 --> 27:53.680]  breaking it's finally being covered now briefly getting back to what I was
[27:53.680 --> 27:57.560]  covering earlier about the troops like Sergeant Bales killing all those people
[27:57.560 --> 28:01.000]  while on a bunch of psychotropic with his foot blown off all your foot's blown
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.520]  off 90% will give you a prosthetic and I saw that in the news and I'd forgotten
[28:05.520 --> 28:08.960]  that was hidden in plain view that's sergeant that went crazy and did all
[28:08.960 --> 28:12.160]  that and should be let off by reason of insanity I'm not saying what he did was
[28:12.160 --> 28:16.680]  good but he's not the one guilty of it you've served four tours you're on
[28:16.680 --> 28:20.800]  psychotropic your foot's blown off they put a prosthesis on and I remember him
[28:20.800 --> 28:26.080]  complaining not willing to be sent back but they automatically re-upting which is
[28:26.080 --> 28:29.040]  an Orwellian term for a draft of those that have already served their contract
[28:29.040 --> 28:31.720]  I mean it's one thing to have a draft that's bad enough that's slavery but of
[28:31.720 --> 28:36.240]  somebody who's already served three tours automatic re-up foot blown off and
[28:36.240 --> 28:40.920]  then I was reading the news today in fact Aaron pull that up and cover that

[33:10.080 --> 33:29.120]  we are back ladies and gentlemen this is info wars dot com i'm erin dyke so of
[33:29.120 --> 33:32.400]  course work with alex he's going to be back in just a few moments
[33:32.400 --> 33:36.240]  but i'm here to bring you some information on the technology cult
[33:36.240 --> 33:40.880]  that attends belterburger each year increasingly but first new prosthetics
[33:40.880 --> 33:45.680]  keep amputee soldiers on active duty uh that's recently in the news in the
[33:45.680 --> 33:48.480]  last couple days at us news and world report
[33:48.480 --> 33:53.200]  they could say roiders report technology advances and strong willpower have
[33:53.200 --> 33:57.440]  allowed some injured soldiers to return to battle
[33:57.440 --> 34:01.520]  put another way it's kind of forcing soldiers back into the meat grinder
[34:01.520 --> 34:05.360]  i realize they're volunteers but it's probably not a good idea to put people
[34:05.360 --> 34:08.960]  full of tragedy and bad episodes back into battle
[34:08.960 --> 34:13.360]  on the drugs and everything ties into what the case alex was talking about
[34:13.360 --> 34:18.240]  before but of course still in the news is the article i covered last week mark of
[34:18.240 --> 34:22.400]  the beast belterburg pushes mandatory id for internet
[34:22.400 --> 34:27.520]  thanks still to drudge for covering that that has to do with neely crows of the
[34:27.520 --> 34:31.200]  e you uh commission for digital agenda
[34:31.200 --> 34:35.760]  and she is now pushing mandatory internet id for europe which of course they
[34:35.760 --> 34:39.600]  want to expand to the rest of the globe and you say well this already came out
[34:39.600 --> 34:41.680]  of the news why is that still related to the
[34:41.680 --> 34:45.680]  belterburg meeting coming up as you know many of the key members put out
[34:45.680 --> 34:50.560]  press releases ahead of time about many of the agenda items they want to cover
[34:50.560 --> 34:54.480]  that way uh it's introduced to the public while they meet about it privately
[34:54.480 --> 34:58.080]  and coordinate the launch of these different types of program
[34:58.080 --> 35:02.880]  and of course that ties in with the new plans to hand over internet authority
[35:02.880 --> 35:07.280]  to the united nations kurt nimo the hill and others have all covered this
[35:07.280 --> 35:10.560]  recently it's up there on drudge today house to
[35:10.560 --> 35:14.560]  examine plan for united nations to regulate the internet
[35:14.560 --> 35:18.160]  and they will be considering the proposal as early as next week
[35:18.160 --> 35:22.640]  allowing countries from china russia brazil and others to help dictate to us
[35:22.640 --> 35:26.640]  what our laws will be online meanwhile tell me if you think
[35:26.640 --> 35:30.880]  this ties into it last year it was reported in
[35:30.880 --> 35:34.960]  the new american that zuckerberg sister randy zuckerberg
[35:34.960 --> 35:38.000]  was there with the rest of the facebook officials
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.680]  at the belterburg meeting that happened in switzerland again last year
[35:41.680 --> 35:45.920]  saying this is the end of internet anonymity
[35:45.920 --> 35:50.320]  anonymousness and of course this year we see neely crows of the eu commission
[35:50.320 --> 35:53.600]  trying to make that happen by making mandatory id's
[35:53.600 --> 35:58.560]  happen for the internet of course you say that was last year well these are
[35:58.560 --> 36:02.720]  ongoing agendas it takes a lot of time and it's a lot more than just the
[36:02.720 --> 36:06.080]  facebook ipo that they clearly planned last year
[36:06.080 --> 36:10.240]  so that's neely crows of the eu commission helping to push the digital
[36:10.240 --> 36:13.440]  agenda meanwhile i haven't talked about this yet i don't
[36:13.440 --> 36:16.640]  think it's broke last year again at belterberg we're
[36:16.640 --> 36:20.160]  watching to see if she returns was one christine
[36:20.160 --> 36:24.160]  varni she's the department of justice anti-trust
[36:24.160 --> 36:28.640]  assistant attorney general for the united states at least she was last year
[36:28.640 --> 36:34.480]  she has set step down from that post and re-entered her work as a lobbyist for
[36:34.480 --> 36:38.080]  who else the internet and computer companies well i looked up christine
[36:38.080 --> 36:41.760]  varni and i've studied her and this is a huge conflict of
[36:41.760 --> 36:45.680]  interest particularly as google has ongoing
[36:45.680 --> 36:50.240]  antitrust actions here's an article from a month ago out of reuters
[36:50.240 --> 36:54.880]  us brings in big gun to google antitrust probe
[36:54.880 --> 36:59.440]  another one is ftc once in on google antitrust action
[36:59.440 --> 37:03.760]  this stuff applies to microsoft and all the other big technology people
[37:03.760 --> 37:06.960]  and again if you study the membership list for the belterberg meeting
[37:06.960 --> 37:10.560]  we're going to break that list again this year for the new attendees
[37:10.560 --> 37:14.000]  but i've studied the old attendees they are
[37:14.000 --> 37:17.280]  just representing these companies it's insider trading
[37:17.280 --> 37:22.080]  insider deals going on and a lot of cloaked shake tans and under the table
[37:22.080 --> 37:25.680]  deals so it's a big deal that christine varni
[37:25.680 --> 37:30.560]  has represented the u.s at the attorney general level for antitrust
[37:30.560 --> 37:33.360]  now as a lobbyist for these internet companies
[37:33.360 --> 37:38.160]  and was before as well she's known as being the single individual who got the
[37:38.160 --> 37:41.120]  ftc which she was also once commissioner of
[37:41.120 --> 37:45.920]  into the game of online privacy she's quote the biggest advocate
[37:45.920 --> 37:51.520]  for enforcing online privacy how by allowing those companies to self
[37:51.520 --> 37:54.960]  regulate she works for these big companies but has
[37:54.960 --> 37:58.640]  been inside the government just like all the other reveal revolving door
[37:58.640 --> 38:04.000]  posts we've seen monsanto has to be the quintessential classic example
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.840]  but anyway this christine varni woman we're expecting her to be back at
[38:07.840 --> 38:12.160]  bill deberg this year and she deals with this privacy antitrust and
[38:12.160 --> 38:15.920]  intellectual property issues probably the three biggest
[38:15.920 --> 38:20.720]  online issues that we are facing and so we're just going to keep an eye on her
[38:20.720 --> 38:25.280]  particularly as she has represented companies in cases where microsoft
[38:25.280 --> 38:28.080]  was in lawsuits with the government over antitrust
[38:28.080 --> 38:33.200]  dealing with the aol merger and other issues as well as a publishing issues
[38:33.200 --> 38:36.480]  and the rest of it so it's something to keep an eye on because she works for big
[38:36.480 --> 38:39.120]  pharma the washington post and all of it
[38:39.120 --> 38:42.800]  now again the media dam has been breaking on bill deberg
[38:42.800 --> 38:46.560]  i think really since alex started covering the group by going to it
[38:46.560 --> 38:51.840]  in 2006 in ottawa canada ever since then we've seen a rise in protesters
[38:51.840 --> 38:57.040]  and a rise of mainstream media covering the bill deberg issue
[38:57.040 --> 39:00.640]  no longer pretending it doesn't exist now shifting into
[39:00.640 --> 39:04.320]  the damage control mode where the washington post will be the first one
[39:04.320 --> 39:08.400]  to report on mark rubio circulating around the bill deberg
[39:08.400 --> 39:12.400]  group he's one who they say may attend this year
[39:12.400 --> 39:16.240]  i don't know if he really will be a vice presidential candidate with romney
[39:16.240 --> 39:20.320]  but they are obviously eyeing him although as i understand it he has
[39:20.320 --> 39:24.400]  a citizenship issue at any rate we will see what happens
[39:24.400 --> 39:27.600]  but we've had the washington post politico new american
[39:27.600 --> 39:33.040]  and a lot of other big papers both online and from the former print world
[39:33.040 --> 39:36.640]  beginning to cover this issue by the way this week we saw
[39:36.640 --> 39:40.400]  warren buffett and his berkshire hathaway company
[39:40.400 --> 39:45.040]  swallow up 63 papers and he thinks he's going to be reviving
[39:45.040 --> 39:48.880]  the print industry with papers and he also wants to
[39:48.880 --> 39:52.720]  accelerate this trend of putting up paywalls for these mainstream news
[39:52.720 --> 39:56.160]  outlets and try to take down blogs that post
[39:56.160 --> 39:59.600]  that news even if they're commenting on it we've seen a lot of that happening
[39:59.600 --> 40:03.520]  already with the right haven case and other things but they're not done
[40:03.520 --> 40:08.400]  yet now we have also talked about facebook i did a big piece
[40:08.400 --> 40:13.920]  exposing and really predicting that the facebook ipo would be a scam a pump and
[40:13.920 --> 40:17.280]  dump issue i knew that because i had studied
[40:17.280 --> 40:22.080]  deeply the fact that five or six executives uh and founders of facebook
[40:22.080 --> 40:25.680]  attended the meeting last year 2011 in saint moritz
[40:25.680 --> 40:29.920]  switzerland among those were reported to be according to the new american
[40:29.920 --> 40:32.880]  mark zuckerberg and his sister randy zuckerberg
[40:32.880 --> 40:36.560]  who as i just mentioned called for the end of internet privacy
[40:36.560 --> 40:39.840]  and anonymity difficult word to say sometimes
[40:39.840 --> 40:44.960]  at any rate we have seen that become a huge scandal the facebook ipo they're
[40:44.960 --> 40:47.520]  now investigating it they are subpoenaing
[40:47.520 --> 40:51.920]  morgan stanley and other entities well in the buildup to that ipo
[40:51.920 --> 40:55.760]  we saw the initial funders who are all tied to intelligence and the builder
[40:55.760 --> 40:59.040]  berg group sell extra shares in the last couple
[40:59.040 --> 41:02.400]  days leading up to it they all prepare to sell extra amounts
[41:02.400 --> 41:05.760]  you saw microsoft get in with big shares you saw
[41:05.760 --> 41:10.160]  goldman sacks get in with big shares of the facebook leading into the ipo
[41:10.160 --> 41:13.840]  you also saw frontmen for the globalists like u2's
[41:13.840 --> 41:18.880]  bono his holding company purchased a huge amount of facebook shares
[41:18.880 --> 41:23.120]  so that they could sell them at the ipo which was clearly overvalued
[41:23.120 --> 41:28.480]  you saw it lose 20 percent and counting from its stock value from the projected
[41:28.480 --> 41:31.920]  100 billion and all the players who put up that big money
[41:31.920 --> 41:35.920]  cashed in we exposed that if you didn't see it go to youtube and the other
[41:35.920 --> 41:40.560]  platforms and check out that report but meanwhile that is not all that facebook
[41:40.560 --> 41:43.520]  is up to shon parker who is the first president of
[41:43.520 --> 41:47.760]  facebook also the creator of napster which really set the
[41:47.760 --> 41:53.120]  tone 10 almost 15 years ago for this clampdown on online privacy
[41:53.120 --> 41:55.920]  for this clampdown on the freedom of the web
[41:55.920 --> 42:00.640]  by initiating napster that made illegal or what would soon become illegal
[42:00.640 --> 42:04.400]  downloading of music and other copyrighted intellectual property
[42:04.400 --> 42:07.920]  cool and popular and widespread particularly among the youth
[42:07.920 --> 42:11.040]  they got millions and millions of people doing that around the globe
[42:11.040 --> 42:16.000]  helping themselves to what would eventually become a new clampdown era of
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.920]  the web shon parker attended bill de berg in 2010
[42:19.920 --> 42:22.880]  he along with other facebook people have declared
[42:22.880 --> 42:27.200]  that this election that is the one upcoming in 2012
[42:27.200 --> 42:32.960]  social media will determine the outcome that's a headline at techcrunch.com
[42:32.960 --> 42:36.160]  and we will see what that happens but he and the others
[42:36.160 --> 42:40.160]  all are part of this company votison and it's no joke because the other
[42:40.160 --> 42:43.760]  facebook founder chris hughes is credited with helping obama win
[42:43.760 --> 42:46.560]  we'll be back after this alex jones will be back
[42:46.560 --> 42:50.880]  we'll hit all the issues including of course continued bill de berg coverage
[42:50.880 --> 42:53.920]  we're on our way and we're going to expose the hell out of them
[42:53.920 --> 42:57.280]  they're trying to legitimize the cyber security issue
[42:57.280 --> 43:01.040]  they're trying to protect online privacy by helping the public the globalist
[43:01.040 --> 43:04.960]  eugenesis control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick

[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:07.200]  protest in the history of billderberg's 58 year
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.960]  run there's been a long time coming and we may never come this way again this is
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.800]  a big deal well i think it's important for people to
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:18.400]  you know even now this you know it's right around the corner but even now i
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:22.640]  think it's important for people to get on social networking sites get it get
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.280]  online get uh look look in your community to see if
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.120]  there's people trying to put together carpools you know it this will
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:33.840]  definitely be the one to be at oh don't resist roll over and die you don't
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:36.560]  have any power the truth is you've got incredible
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.680]  power robert and they know it what do you think about all the trolls and the
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:43.440]  autobot uh megaphones the pentagon admit saying protesting
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.480]  does nothing really they fought to say billderberg
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.320]  didn't exist now the mainstream horror media has to admit it exists
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.840]  how big of a defeat is that for them well you know the
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:58.240]  the fact that they're having to pull gimmicks and pull antics and
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:02.720]  and basically like you said they cheat uh you know and how they handle their
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.000]  information and and how they brainwash people
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.440]  uh it's important for people to now ignore what they're doing
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.120]  as as rebuttals because they're all empty every attempt that they have to
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.560]  discredit us as empty uh and just focus your energy on
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:20.080]  on spreading the information about billderberg and and helping
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:24.960]  push it farther into the mainstream because it's already going mainstream
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:28.480]  and they literally 10 years ago they said it didn't exist
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.360]  five years ago they said ah there's their coax doesn't exist
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:34.480]  the new york times four years ago said i was insane
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.920]  and was at chantele virginia covering it and that nothing was there
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:41.360]  now they've got to admit it exists but be condescending
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:44.720]  watching the public sit there while they condescended us
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:50.400]  like we're idiots is is is ridiculous the sleeper is awakening the trance is
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.160]  breaking do you agree with me i absolutely agree with you and
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:57.280]  and to build on what you just said uh we can't
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:01.760]  let it escape people's memory that the position on billderberg has been
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:05.440]  it doesn't exist we can't let people forget that they lied about its existence
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.880]  up to this point as they tried to call it just a
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:12.960]  brainstorming session or a think tank or or something like that we have to
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.160]  remind yeah first it didn't exist then it was no big deal
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:20.080]  online yeah they're making decisions technocrats are running europe
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:24.000]  aren't you glad they're saving you yeah well you know it's like
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.600]  big jim says you know good deeds are done in the sunshine
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:32.800]  god bless you you've made some stunning points anything else you'd like to add
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:37.360]  my compadre uh well
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.960]  just thanks for having me on and uh hopefully there'll be
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:45.360]  at least a thousand people at this protest this year
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:51.200]  god bless you absolutely look they had over a thousand people erin and uh
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:55.600]  watson were there last night in the middle of nowhere in the high mountains
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:59.120]  they were on top mountains with only like one more mountain above them
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:03.360]  at like you know nine thousand feet in switzerland
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.720]  and the globalist Tucker sources said we're like what they have money to
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:11.760]  protest shut down the economy more that's the oligarchal
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:15.040]  instinct is to shut down make people poor so that
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:18.240]  they're so poor they've got to stay in their mud hut so they can't come
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:22.480]  protest you while you're behind your armored walls that's feudalism
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:27.840]  but over the four days at one point erin said there were over 600 people
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:30.880]  and that's our problems we're not coordinated but it doesn't matter
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.040]  that's also our strength it's our weakness also our strength
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.680]  i think we're gonna have two three thousand quite frankly i feel something
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.240]  big's about to happen they may even crap their pants and pull out and not do it
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.960]  four years ago at this same hotel in virginia
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.800]  Madeleine Albright pulled in was yelled at as people recognized her that slaves
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:53.520]  knew who she was she began panicking and drove out freaking out
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:57.040]  again when you identify and see the vampire or like they live
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:00.720]  when i got one that can see

[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.880]  program here in ohio called trucks yield
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:10.720]  it gets a giant tattletale program yeah they're training
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:15.120]  doctors dentist lawyers truck drivers to spy on everybody
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:19.200]  but it's not for al qaeda that works for the cia it's for good old boys and gun
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:22.880]  owners the giant spy society go ahead and tell me about
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:27.520]  yeah there's an article titled ohio truckers to help highway patrol
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:33.520]  keep roads safer reduce crime and they speak about uh how they're gonna have
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:36.640]  they're gonna patrol officers are being made available
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:40.480]  to trucking companies to train their drivers on how to spot and report
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:44.880]  impaired drivers crime homeland security concerns as well as human
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.600]  trafficking
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:51.520]  i just thought that was very well you know i've talked to state police and
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:55.840]  and the guy that drives the bus for us was a truck driver for decades
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.200]  and he'll tell you state police in virginia pulled him over and also in
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.640]  tennessee and said you know why we pull you truckers over
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:06.320]  there's all sorts of fake violations and we know you're not violent
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:09.200]  so yeah you can sign up with homeland security so they can write your tickets
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:13.520]  and you can you can grovel to them and say it's patriotic to be a slave
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.320]  and the cops believe they're writing all these tickets to fund the country when
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:19.440]  it's all going to foreign banks yeah no they're they're trying to listen my
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:23.280]  dad's a dentist in fact he he's over hundreds of
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:26.400]  dentists for a big company but he used to own his own dental
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:30.080]  offices but about a year ago he got a visit by homeland security
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.960]  and he thought it was just him he thought this must be a setup because of my
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:36.720]  son they wanted to spy on his patients and he's like my patients are
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:40.000]  terrorists they're like just report on them to us we're gonna pay him money
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.880]  he said no i'm not gonna do it and he wouldn't talk to other dentists all of
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:47.040]  them got homeland security visits it is just the opposite of freedom
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.320]  but we're supposed to see the new freedom on memorial day celebrate
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:53.680]  checkpoints celebrate wiretaps celebrate drones
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:56.960]  celebrate the irs taking your house with no warrant or no proof
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.800]  celebrate cancer celebrate fluoride in the water celebrate slavery
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:04.000]  so again i'm anti-american because i'm like george washington
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.760]  so tell us about the homeland security training
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:12.800]  well it's uh that's basically it i mean
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:17.120]  like you said i could see them the highway patrol harassing truck drivers
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:22.320]  which gives them an incentive to possibly play ball
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.440]  with the snow no no they put marines and you name it
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:29.440]  they put congressmen on the no fly list no judge no jury you just can't fly
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:32.480]  government said they're now saying there's gonna be a no gun buy list that's
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:36.400]  official type in no buy list the atf says they're about to ban
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.720]  almost all shotguns because they feel like it no law just hey we're god
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:46.320]  now that was in the news yesterday just hey we're god and uh they're saying that
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:50.480]  they'll do whatever they want and the average person thinks groveling to these
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.160]  people is going to get them out of it that
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:58.160]  that's the opposite absolutely that's all i had for you

[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:07.280]  that's why this is so good even though all these people serve the system like
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:10.080]  little cowards they think oh we've got a big corrupt system

[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:18.320]  that's the good news all these traders all these collaborators all these people
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:22.800]  that did this they'll be destroyed as well

[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:40.800]  and his wife had to run for her life because she was in bed sleeping and
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:46.320]  all of a sudden he was he was trying to choke her
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:49.680]  and they had to well that's a patriotic she should have
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:53.360]  she should have taken a hatchet and first hacked off her hands and her head
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:56.560]  and gone i'm patriotic my husband was in the military
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.920]  and she should have just taken a hatchet and hacked herself in the head
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.600]  that would have been patriotic to run from somebody on a bunch of pentagon
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.800]  drugs who's killed a bunch of people and is totally mentally ill
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:10.560]  is unpatriotic she should have taken an ice pick and just stabbed herself in the
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:14.640]  neck 20 times going i'm patriotic instead of running from him
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:19.440]  i mean that was wrong what she did but they had to put him in the va psych ward

[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:10.560]  broadcasting network network
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:26.000]  yes the head of the imf tells greeks to pay their taxes

[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:06.400]  segment but right now let's go back to shawna Arizona
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:11.200]  diana louisiana and others shawna you're on the air worldwide
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:15.280]  thank you alex uh... i've got a couple of bullet uh... quotes today uh... on
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:20.000]  sleep slavery and freedom for memorial day may i begin
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.120]  you've got the floor worldwide thank you sir
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:26.880]  i know of no better way for the state to keep its people
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:30.640]  under control than a perpetual state of war
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:36.720]  joseph stalin scientific concept of dictatorship means neither more nor
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:41.360]  less than unlimited power resting directly on force
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:45.440]  not limited by anything not restricted by any laws
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:49.280]  nor absolute rules nothing else but that
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:53.600]  lenin and here i have another one our power
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:59.280]  does not know liberty or justice it is entirely established on the destruction
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:04.320]  of the individual will we will find a way to debase humanity
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:08.560]  down to the lowest level of existence like down in florida today
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:12.720]  and uh... cruise cruise ship said that that i have a couple
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:17.600]  a couple of them on on freedom here this is just a tremendous quote that every
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:22.240]  black american should be proud the quote is this power concedes
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:26.720]  nothing without a demand it never did and never will
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:29.760]  find out just what people will submit to
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:33.760]  and you have found the out the exact amount of injustice
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:38.400]  and wrong which will be opposed upon them that's that's thomas jefferson
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:41.520]  that my friend it's frederick douglas
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.880]  it is a friend i don't know if i don't know if frederick douglas was worth
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:48.160]  frederick douglas was paraphrasing uh...
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:51.360]  uh... jefferson there though yeah that that is frederick douglas frederick
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:54.960]  douglas said power is not given up it is demanded
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:58.000]  but go ahead hey well i stand to be corrected
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.320]  uh... there are no no no you're right by jefferson said that follows and nobody
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:06.560]  ever seems to quote it it's this the strongest reason for the people to
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:11.200]  retain the right to keep and bear arms is at last resort
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:14.560]  to protect themselves against tyranny and government
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:18.720]  never heard that quoted by anybody before i've got one i've got a short one
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:22.960]  up by t-art teddy roosevelt that this this goes to what we talk about every
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:24.880]  day what you talk about every day
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:27.840]  at t-art said this to announce
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:31.120]  that there must be no criticism of the president
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:33.920]  or that we are to stand by the president
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:37.840]  right or wrong is not only unpatriotic
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:42.240]  and servile but morally treasurable to the american public
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:45.520]  and don't these just give you chills
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.640]  now they do and he did say that on record there's even one of the first film
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:53.040]  clips of a president repeat paraphrase that also his famous arena quote
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:57.360]  but what do you make of not just the school teacher saying be arrested if
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:00.800]  you criticize obama but others are saying that i have tv
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:04.000]  newscast where they say don't talk about obama
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  or we will uh... arrest you i mean this is getting really crazy
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.960]  what do you think of australia once a very free country saying
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:15.920]  don't criticize carbon taxes or a one million plus dollar fine
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:19.760]  i mean this is this is authoritarianism it's it's racing
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:26.640]  on every front but i see that as a sign by the corporate governing class that's
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:30.880]  used government to kill the free market and competition the monopoly class
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:33.840]  as a sign of desperation what do you say
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:37.600]  well absolutely and of course the bible talks about it at the end
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:41.520]  time when christ comes back people will come to him and say i've done this and
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:44.240]  this in your name and he'll say go i do not
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:47.840]  you know fleet for me i do not know you and really there's just a remnant that
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.720]  really understand freedom and liberty anymore
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:54.480]  uh... like you and i and and the listeners do i i think it really comes
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:58.320]  down to that and it's a very unfortunate
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:02.160]  well you're an amazing caller i really enjoyed hearing your points and i'm
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:05.200]  glad that we were able to able to get you on
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:09.600]  and all those quotes you stated yes i know frederick douglas he actually even
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:13.120]  had some quotes that were that were paraphrased but expanded on of
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:16.240]  jefferson in fact i did a video like four or five
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:19.120]  years ago with a quote of his in there but but but it was like
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:23.760]  freedom and rights are not given they're demanded they're taken i i i
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:26.560]  i forget the full scope of it but they were basically paraphrased jefferson
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:31.040]  but the way he said it was even more powerful i mean look a nation of sheep
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:35.760]  will be ruled by wolves it's a very simple equation
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:39.360]  if we roll over criminal elements will take over
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:44.320]  and by the very textbook of tyranny we're under it and it's a joke
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:47.680]  to sit there and put up with us any longer thank you so much and god bless
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.120]  you because i got so many phone calls here on my little computer screen
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:55.040]  and they're all okay freedom in california well that's an oxymoron
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:59.520]  uh... hello freedom uh... under globalist takeover a globalist beachhead
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.400]  california how are you doing over
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:06.000]  good uh... thank you alex for taking my call i've been a student of freedom for
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.280]  about twenty years and a fan of yours for just about as long
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:11.760]  um... i want to tell you about something that i think is one of the most
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:14.480]  important things that we can be aware of today
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:17.280]  and it has to do with canceling out the debts
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:20.480]  uh... that people owe to the bankers and um...
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:24.160]  it has to do with something called accepted for value are you familiar with
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:25.840]  this
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:29.760]  yeah you have to accept a contract they just can't announce a contract and say
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:32.720]  you're under it and even if they have you sign a contract
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:36.480]  if it's done in fraud it's null and void all of this is null and void
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:39.920]  and i declare it's a fraud and i declare it it's a scam
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:44.160]  they tell you protesting doesn't have power or saying no doesn't have power
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:47.040]  why are they swat teaming and setting up protesters whether they're
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:50.400]  conservative or liberal everywhere because the system
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:55.040]  is scared of it that's why i'm headed to bill deberg to get in their face big
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:58.720]  time they had the media telling the public it didn't exist
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:01.760]  how discredited are they now go ahead and make your point
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:05.360]  yeah they're extremely discredited now and and and the bankers are trying to
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:09.120]  force the fraud upon all of the people and what happens is the people have to
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:11.680]  be aware of the nature of money and banking
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:14.480]  and they gotta be aware they're gonna stage a terror attack and pose a
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:17.040]  savers but yeah get into the fractional reserve
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:19.760]  banking preach it tell them explain it
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:23.920]  credit is created with a signature and when something is put upon you to pay
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:26.640]  and there's no credit no no substance in payment
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:33.120]  you go back to this uh the policy which is hjr 192 of june 5th 1933
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:37.040]  that says no contracts can be put forth a call for payment substance they have to
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:40.960]  be and i'm talking about this 15 years ago people laugh
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:44.400]  but now we hear about bank of america wells fargo others taking houses
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:47.600]  they never had a deed to that weren't in foreclosure
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:51.920]  cash paid paid off houses the police come and take you out of them
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:56.000]  and give it to bank of america and then it comes out in court they stole the
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.400]  thing and lied in court to get it
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:03.440]  it's incredible and the banks loan you money that never existed
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:07.920]  to be able to take over property you're absolutely right it's incredible
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:12.240]  true the way that we can deal with that though is what we accept those contracts
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:16.720]  and they don't accept our acceptance of those contracts they are in now in
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:19.840]  default and we now become the owner of that contract
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:23.200]  which means we can proceed to involuntary bankruptcy at that point
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:27.040]  because we're going to explain this now let me boil this down in
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.840]  layman's terms so folks don't get confused about what you're saying
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:32.960]  we've never been a perfect country but we've been the freest the world's ever
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:37.200]  seen so it created wealth untold five percent of the population of the
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:40.640]  world had half the wealth now or six percent of the population
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:43.920]  have about 20 we've been robbed a bunch of shysters
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:49.600]  carpetbaggers scammers flim flammers projectors con men came in
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.400]  created a bunch of financial instruments that are fraudulent
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:56.240]  leverage the Ponzi scheme to take over the government and are now saying we're
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:00.480]  terrorists if we don't want to be gang raped by Bernie Madoff
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:04.000]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing

[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:28.160]  2012 i had a bilderberg in virginia
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:31.520]  we're going to take your calls in this segment i will news blitz on the other
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:33.840]  stories i've alluded to but haven't gotten to
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:40.080]  in the next segment guys who is up next who should i go to next
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:44.400]  diane and then daniel steve david john hamilton and others
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:50.480]  diane in louisiana you're on the air happy trail alex and info crew
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:55.520]  i'm calling from frima regions number six i was going to find out
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:34:01.840]  what's the deal with rick perry and endorsing a david dogerst
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:05.600]  well david dogerst was in the cia and involved in black cops with some really
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.240]  bad stuff happened happened in latin america
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:12.320]  he helped get the tsa into texas when the legislature passed unanimously a law
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:15.920]  against it to grow up and molest our children
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:20.800]  david dogerst is super bad i got to be honest um
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:26.560]  the other republican candidate mr cruz running against him is almost as bad
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:30.480]  but claims he's a ron paul type but uh the fact that the establishment
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:34.240]  is behind dogerst and doers has got about a 15-point lead
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:38.160]  uh shows you that he's super bad news i mean rick perry's the guy that got up
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:40.800]  on the news and said it's the law to take an experimental
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:44.160]  vaccine that's been killing people in trials
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:48.240]  well it wasn't the law he just claimed it was and got exposed by the
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:51.760]  legislature but rick perry is a discredited
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:56.000]  monster so he should just get out of politics and go straight to hades
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.640]  but uh what do you think of that i'm i am in agreement with you but i was
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:03.920]  shaking over the internet and i ran across this ron paul
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:08.240]  fest that's going to be held in florida and they're looking for thousands and
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:12.800]  thousands to attend i wish i could be there
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:15.760]  i don't know about the ron paul fest but i know they got a lot of people going
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:21.680]  to the tampa yeah from august 24 through to 26
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:24.880]  i'm sure it's going to be wild uh what else is on your mind today
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:28.400]  okay oh yeah and the vet i enjoyed the vet storing the metals
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:33.680]  at that g20 vomit or whatever that was held up there
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:37.200]  it was just amazing well let's talk about metals i mean
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:40.720]  sure that they threw their afghan metals back our government which is a
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:43.440]  criminal foreign banking group it's hijacked the country
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:48.560]  grows opium publicly it was like 10 percent of world production it's 93

[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:09.520]  doesn't matter it's now out there and uh this is the type of stuff they're
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:13.440]  doing and they want to sell us on tyranny as if we
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:17.520]  support the troops the troops don't want tyranny the troops
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:20.960]  don't want this the globalists hide behind the troops what do you say to

[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:50.800]  who reportedly abused three little girls as the head
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:54.800]  in philadelphia of the tsa every day or two
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:58.240]  i read about them kidnapping children raping women
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:02.480]  shipping drugs who else wants to be a tsa agent
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:05.760]  it's a tenth amendment violation the feds are out of their jurisdiction
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:10.720]  it's a fourth amendment violation it is a joke it is an abomination
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:13.680]  but soon they'll have us salute the new american flag
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:17.040]  which is an image of a child being raped by a tsa agent
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:20.720]  well i'm sorry that's not my america nor mine
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:25.600]  um but they they're all kind of this guy's an illegal alien and they make

[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:37.040]  yeah listen tsa's confirmed they don't do background checks
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:40.800]  stalin and hitler both when they got into power hired people out of the
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:44.960]  prisons that's why they do it it normal police
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:48.400]  have been training the bill rights constitution these aren't police
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:52.400]  the police can't randomly pull you over and stick their hands down your pants
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.080]  or grop your wife or daughters they do it's illegal
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:00.320]  now the tsa's running highway checkpoints in all 50 states
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:04.320]  it's all i mean what do you think about that it's appalling like the
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:07.840]  most of these you're covered you know um
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:11.600]  well we also have a situation with fast and furious
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:16.880]  where um it dovetails with another operation that's been going on here for
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:20.240]  many years which is the the takeover by the
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:23.840]  criminal syndicates of uh well much of the american west
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:28.960]  and um but the yeah the feds are the feds already have 87 percent
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:32.000]  of the western states property now they want all the rest of it
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.720]  and if you don't like it a swatch and will drop by with machines
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:39.200]  that's not that's not what i mean i mean the the the cartels are taking over a
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:43.600]  whole bunch of the american west uh with their oh yeah the drug cartels have
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:46.400]  got most of police and more patrol working for them yeah that's come out
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:51.440]  now uh when you look at fast and furious it doesn't end
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:55.760]  with uh the uh the demonization of the second amendment
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:00.480]  when they when they commit murder of border patrol
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:04.160]  they are doing it for a purpose and the purpose is the takeover
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:09.520]  of uh of american territory uh for for the mexican cartels
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:14.400]  and no no they have the listen two-thirds of them
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:17.200]  several years ago two-thirds of the way into arizona
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:21.040]  they have signs of saying don't go in national parks because these areas are
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:24.640]  controlled by drug cartels remember that yes and that's what i mean
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:28.720]  what it what it means is that fast and furious is not simply a drug running
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:34.000]  operation or no it's the criminals at the justice department
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.480]  arming criminal gangs to lari conquista or recon
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:42.960]  the united states right but it's it's the first two parts of a four-part plan
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.040]  that is high treason in a strict sense and when
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:51.760]  when you look at the the writing in the constitution
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:55.760]  on that it's very carefully parsed and i say that this fulfills
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:01.120]  uh high treason and uh that's of course it does when obama says he's
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:05.520]  going to launch wars uh in other countries without congressional
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:08.800]  approval it's treason when obama says he's going to have the nsa
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:12.960]  smiling you without warrants it's treason when the irs takes your property
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:15.600]  without due process as a collection agency for the private
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:18.880]  federal reserve it's treason when the school gives your kid an
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:22.560]  inoculation or an abortion without parental consent it's treason
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:27.600]  we have a government of four and by criminal treason
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:31.760]  against our republic and it's time to wake up i appreciate your call great

[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:55.040]  uh to supposedly educate us uh sheeple about

[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:07.360]  to put this event on and it reminded me to hearing the description on kehlby
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:10.160]  jay and and listening to the excerpts of the song
