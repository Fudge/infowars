[00:00.000 --> 00:09.480]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.480 --> 00:10.480]  You want answers?
[00:10.480 --> 00:12.680]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.680 --> 00:16.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:16.800 --> 00:25.600]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:25.600 --> 00:27.360]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[00:27.360 --> 00:28.360]  I'm David Knight.
[00:28.360 --> 00:33.280]  It is Friday, June 7, 2013, the second day of Bilderberg.
[00:33.280 --> 00:36.040]  Alex is going to be joining us in a little while live from London.
[00:36.040 --> 00:37.040]  He's been there all week.
[00:37.040 --> 00:40.560]  It's not just a second day for him.
[00:40.560 --> 00:42.520]  We've got videos.
[00:42.520 --> 00:46.080]  Alex has actually barged in to Bilderberg.
[00:46.080 --> 00:50.080]  He's actually out on a barge bullhorning Bilderberg.
[00:50.080 --> 00:53.240]  And we've got some live video that's going up on Ustream of that.
[00:53.240 --> 00:59.720]  You can follow everything as it's breaking at infowars.com forward slash B as in Bilderberg.
[00:59.720 --> 01:00.720]  And we've got some video of that.
[01:00.720 --> 01:05.600]  We're also going to be playing some audio from that video coming up in the next segment.
[01:05.600 --> 01:10.600]  A lot of things are breaking in the last couple of days about the government spying
[01:10.600 --> 01:11.600]  on people.
[01:11.600 --> 01:13.640]  Now, of course, we've been talking about this for years.
[01:13.640 --> 01:18.000]  Alex has been talking about it for years, just as he's been talking about Bilderberg.
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.440]  And it's kind of interesting to see these things now being talked about by the mainstream
[01:22.440 --> 01:26.000]  media now coming out into the open.
[01:26.000 --> 01:27.880]  And it's interesting to see how they're spinning this.
[01:27.880 --> 01:29.120]  And we're going to be talking about this.
[01:29.120 --> 01:32.440]  There's a couple of links from Infowars up on the Dredge Report.
[01:32.440 --> 01:39.640]  A key one, a very key link that we've got up there is David Petraeus at Bilderberg to
[01:39.640 --> 01:42.440]  craft a quote, big data spy grid.
[01:42.440 --> 01:47.840]  That's an article from Infowars, Paul Joseph Watson says, former CIA director is helping
[01:47.840 --> 01:51.480]  to bolster the same surveillance system that brought him down.
[01:51.480 --> 01:56.920]  At Bilderberg's official agenda for 2013 lists, one of the areas of discussion as, quote,
[01:56.920 --> 02:00.760]  how big data is changing almost everything, unquote.
[02:00.760 --> 02:05.520]  It's a reference to the Internet of Things, as they put it, along with the ubiquitous growth
[02:05.520 --> 02:09.520]  of social media and how it's transforming the world of surveillance, the ability to
[02:09.520 --> 02:11.800]  foresee and manipulate future events.
[02:11.800 --> 02:17.280]  And at exactly the same time, Watson points out a Homeland Security subcommittee in the
[02:17.280 --> 02:23.320]  US will also be discussing big data and its implications in the context of social media.
[02:23.320 --> 02:27.360]  The discussion about big data is also likely to cover how social media can be used to launch
[02:27.360 --> 02:32.920]  more faux revolutions and social movements, as it was in Egypt, which was aided in no
[02:32.920 --> 02:35.240]  small part by Google.
[02:35.240 --> 02:36.240]  That's right.
[02:36.240 --> 02:41.040]  And as Paul Joseph Watson points out, finally in the last sentence, it's very true, spooks
[02:41.040 --> 02:44.640]  won't have to plant a bug in your home or vehicle.
[02:44.640 --> 02:46.400]  You will be doing it for them.
[02:46.400 --> 02:47.400]  That's right.
[02:47.400 --> 02:49.560]  You buy your smart phone, you buy your computer.
[02:49.560 --> 02:50.560]  That's what they're using.
[02:50.560 --> 02:58.240]  And now, today, just yesterday, we learned that the government was going in and getting
[02:58.240 --> 03:02.200]  millions of phone records, all the subscribers to Verizon.
[03:02.200 --> 03:06.960]  Now, don't tell me they've got a reasonable cause for that.
[03:06.960 --> 03:13.760]  You don't get, in one court order, millions of records about phone calls.
[03:13.760 --> 03:17.920]  There is no such thing as reasonable support for that.
[03:17.920 --> 03:19.160]  And it's not just Verizon.
[03:19.160 --> 03:25.360]  You know that this is just a secret document that's been leaked about one of the Internet,
[03:25.360 --> 03:26.960]  one of the mobile carriers.
[03:26.960 --> 03:29.080]  It's going to be everybody that they're going after.
[03:29.080 --> 03:33.720]  There was a big stink just a few weeks ago about the fact that the Obama administration
[03:33.720 --> 03:38.480]  was doing this very same thing to AP, to journalists at AP.
[03:38.480 --> 03:44.640]  And that was a big deal because if you remember back to Watergate, Nixon and Kissinger had
[03:44.640 --> 03:46.160]  charges brought against them.
[03:46.160 --> 03:47.160]  Nixon was impeached.
[03:47.160 --> 03:50.760]  Some of the charges were the wiretapping charges that he did against reporters like William
[03:50.760 --> 03:51.760]  Sapphire.
[03:51.760 --> 03:54.800]  There was only about 17 reporters that they wiretapped, and the reason they were doing
[03:54.800 --> 04:00.760]  it was because Kissinger wanted to find out if they were leaking information where the
[04:00.760 --> 04:05.640]  sources of the information were being leaked about his illegal bombing of Cambodia.
[04:05.640 --> 04:07.760]  Doesn't that sound like today?
[04:07.760 --> 04:12.360]  I mean, they had illegally started a war against Cambodia.
[04:12.360 --> 04:16.280]  Now, of course, the war against Vietnam, you could argue, was also illegal.
[04:16.280 --> 04:18.120]  We now know it was a false flag.
[04:18.120 --> 04:21.040]  It was admitted to be a false flag by McNamara.
[04:21.040 --> 04:24.120]  But they were doing this to keep tabs on people.
[04:24.120 --> 04:26.840]  And that was a big deal, as it should have been.
[04:26.840 --> 04:31.560]  We should have gotten rid of crooks like Nixon and Kissinger ought to be in jail instead
[04:31.560 --> 04:34.600]  of meeting at Bilderberg right now.
[04:34.600 --> 04:39.840]  But today, the government can do that to everyone in the United States.
[04:39.840 --> 04:43.320]  And the question is, what, if anything, are we going to do about it?
[04:43.320 --> 04:44.840]  We'll be talking about that.
[04:44.840 --> 04:48.080]  We'll be covering Bilderberg with Alex Jones right after this break.
[04:48.080 --> 04:49.320]  Stay tuned.
[04:49.320 --> 05:05.120]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security
[05:05.120 --> 05:09.880]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[05:09.880 --> 05:13.800]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[05:13.800 --> 05:15.320]  Check out Simply Safe.
[05:15.320 --> 05:19.760]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[05:54.000 --> 05:56.880]  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[05:56.880 --> 06:00.640]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com.
[06:00.640 --> 06:03.440]  Hi I'm Steve Shank, founder of eFoodsDirect.
[06:03.440 --> 06:08.360]  Right now we have a huge number of Americans that are in serious trouble, right smack dab
[06:08.360 --> 06:10.760]  in the middle of the Oklahoma disasters.
[06:10.760 --> 06:15.400]  I know that thousands of you, like us, are frustrated with not being able to help those
[06:15.400 --> 06:18.240]  who have lost so much and are in so much pain.
[06:18.240 --> 06:20.400]  We can't stand idly by.
[06:20.400 --> 06:24.320]  Food is the best way to help the victims and support the relief effort.
[06:24.320 --> 06:28.520]  We have a plan for any of you who would like to partner with us in providing food in this
[06:28.520 --> 06:30.160]  desperate time of need.
[06:30.160 --> 06:35.520]  We've built a 7 day emergency food package containing breakfast, lunch and dinner for
[06:35.520 --> 06:39.560]  a whole week for one adult, valued at $60.
[06:39.560 --> 06:44.440]  Over $25 will ship this life-saving supply directly to those in need.
[06:44.440 --> 06:49.760]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com.
[06:49.760 --> 06:54.880]  That's 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com.
[06:54.880 --> 06:57.840]  The food is contributed at considerably less than cost.
[06:57.840 --> 07:00.200]  Thank you.
[07:00.200 --> 07:04.880]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[07:04.880 --> 07:06.920]  immunity and health.
[07:06.920 --> 07:11.560]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of
[07:11.560 --> 07:13.720]  silver-based products.
[07:13.720 --> 07:19.400]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce nano-silver solutions, our 2-ounce
[07:19.400 --> 07:24.800]  nano-silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[07:24.800 --> 07:28.800]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[07:28.800 --> 07:33.440]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and
[07:33.440 --> 07:35.760]  leave the silver at the surface.
[07:35.760 --> 07:40.240]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry
[07:40.240 --> 07:45.400]  of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more
[07:45.400 --> 07:47.000]  effectively.

[08:16.840 --> 08:28.920]  the mind of man, Thomas Jefferson.
[08:28.920 --> 08:31.520]  Welcome back to the InfoWars live radio show.
[08:31.520 --> 08:36.560]  This is Alex Jones Radio, and we're going to be covering Bill DeBerg with Alex Jones
[08:36.560 --> 08:38.480]  live a little bit later in the program.
[08:38.480 --> 08:41.280]  We're also going to have David Ike coming up as an interview.
[08:41.280 --> 08:45.000]  We've just learned that Alex is going to be having him on probably at the beginning
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  of the second hour.
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.560]  Things are always fluid when we're trying to get connections to the UK live.
[08:52.560 --> 08:54.880]  We have a couple of stories that are up on the Drudge Report.
[08:54.880 --> 08:59.160]  One, a member of Secretive Conclave set to speak on record.
[08:59.160 --> 09:04.080]  We'll see if that actually happens, but that's been rumored to be happening, and that's an
[09:04.080 --> 09:05.440]  article we've got up about that.
[09:05.440 --> 09:09.680]  And also, Petraeus at Bill DeBerg to craft big data spy grid.
[09:09.680 --> 09:11.080]  I just talked about that briefly.
[09:11.080 --> 09:17.880]  Now, of course, he's there with the head of Google, also with the head of Amazon, and
[09:17.880 --> 09:23.760]  in just the last day, we see headline news that this is from the Washington Post.
[09:23.760 --> 09:28.640]  The US is mining data from nine leading internet firms.
[09:28.640 --> 09:31.200]  Companies deny any knowledge of that, of course.
[09:31.200 --> 09:36.560]  Glenn Greenwald, this is the reporter from The Guardian, who broke the story about the
[09:36.560 --> 09:43.400]  Verizon secret court order spying on millions of customers across the United States.
[09:43.400 --> 09:46.800]  Glenn Greenwald says, the US wants to destroy privacy worldwide.
[09:46.800 --> 09:47.880]  Absolutely.
[09:47.880 --> 09:50.760]  That's what the Utah Data Center is about.
[09:50.760 --> 09:54.120]  It's about recording everybody's conversations worldwide.
[09:54.120 --> 09:59.240]  They're working on the data mining software, and it's going to be kind of like a terminator
[09:59.240 --> 10:03.040]  type of scenario where in the future, as their data mining gets better, they'll be able to
[10:03.040 --> 10:08.400]  go back to these records that they have stored, and they'll be able to search them in detail.
[10:08.400 --> 10:13.160]  It's kind of like, remember what, I think it was Stalin's one of his henchmen, or as
[10:13.160 --> 10:16.840]  Alex would call him one of his minions, what he said.
[10:16.840 --> 10:19.760]  He said, bring me the man, and I'll find the crime.
[10:19.760 --> 10:25.440]  Well, if you've got all the electronic correspondence of anybody, you can search through it.
[10:25.440 --> 10:27.040]  You can take stuff out of context.
[10:27.040 --> 10:30.200]  You can make a criminal out of anybody, and that's what this is about.
[10:30.200 --> 10:35.080]  This is about an oppressive authoritarian grid that they're superimposing on the United
[10:35.080 --> 10:37.080]  States, especially.
[10:37.080 --> 10:39.600]  That score is going to be focused.
[10:39.600 --> 10:41.400]  Britain faces a decade of austerity.
[10:41.400 --> 10:46.840]  These are all articles that are on infowars.com, 11-year-old suspended because he said, gun.
[10:46.840 --> 10:51.440]  Obama picks the Libya war architect for the UN ambassador.
[10:51.440 --> 10:53.480]  That's right, Samantha Powers.
[10:53.480 --> 10:59.280]  Right after he puts in Susan Rice, who was the one putting out that lie about what was
[10:59.280 --> 11:05.200]  going on in Benghazi, now he's got the other lady who is involved in this, Samantha Powers.
[11:05.200 --> 11:10.080]  I guess I could call her a lady, I'm sure we give her that much respect, I don't know.
[11:10.080 --> 11:13.000]  Senate defeats bills to keep student loan rates low.
[11:13.000 --> 11:14.000]  That's right.
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.680]  We got to get those students indebted from the very beginning to the big banks.
[11:17.680 --> 11:19.040]  And here's one for Rachel Maddow.
[11:19.040 --> 11:24.920]  Rachel, you should read this, this is on infowars.com, it's originally a natural news article.
[11:24.920 --> 11:28.480]  Weather weapons have existed for over 15 years, Rachel.
[11:28.480 --> 11:32.960]  This testimony from the US Secretary of Defense, maybe you didn't get that memo.
[11:32.960 --> 11:40.320]  So next time you try to take Alex's comments out of context and harangue him about weather
[11:40.320 --> 11:46.160]  modification, you might want to look at the testimony of the Secretary of Defense.
[11:46.160 --> 11:49.840]  Well we're talking about Google, we're talking about David Petraeus, and we're talking about
[11:49.840 --> 11:55.280]  how the global elites who don't even want you to know, to see their faces, know what
[11:55.280 --> 12:00.840]  they're doing, know that they're in attendance at Bilderberg, they want to know everything
[12:00.840 --> 12:01.840]  about you.
[12:01.840 --> 12:03.000]  And at the heart of that is Google.
[12:03.000 --> 12:08.600]  Now there was an article from Financial Times, Google is the GE of the 21st century.
[12:08.600 --> 12:09.920]  That's kind of interesting.
[12:09.920 --> 12:14.080]  The subtitle was Layer Page has boundless ambition and the capacity to deliver unexpected
[12:14.080 --> 12:15.080]  products.
[12:15.080 --> 12:20.000]  And on the article, this analogy of the GE of the 21st century, what they're saying
[12:20.000 --> 12:28.480]  is that GE really transformed things because more than anybody, although GE didn't develop
[12:28.480 --> 12:32.680]  electricity the way that we ultimately wound up using it, of course Edison was trying to
[12:32.680 --> 12:38.120]  do DC current, Tesla was doing AC, which was eventually adapted.
[12:38.120 --> 12:45.280]  Edison's GE essentially was more successful financially than, obviously, than Tesla was.
[12:45.280 --> 12:50.040]  The quote from the article says, compared with the 1890s, Google resembles GE while Amazon
[12:50.040 --> 12:54.560]  is like Sears Robuck, the catalog shopping company that transformed US retailing.
[12:54.560 --> 12:59.360]  GE was founded in 1892 in Sears Robuck in 1893 at a time when the continent was altered
[12:59.360 --> 13:01.080]  by the telegraph and electricity.
[13:01.080 --> 13:06.960]  And so now we see that the equivalent of Sears Robuck and GE, the people that transformed
[13:06.960 --> 13:13.600]  retailing as well as electricity distribution, those two equivalents in modern day, the 21st
[13:13.600 --> 13:16.960]  century, Google and Amazon are both at Bilderberg.
[13:16.960 --> 13:20.240]  And of course, it's about big data, it's about information.
[13:20.240 --> 13:26.480]  And Gigi Arnetta had a special report that she aired actually last week and it's on
[13:26.480 --> 13:28.400]  Google Gestapo.
[13:28.400 --> 13:29.400]  Here's that report.
[13:29.400 --> 13:32.840]  The Google Gestapo is coming to a city near you.
[13:32.840 --> 13:33.840]  That's right.
[13:33.840 --> 13:39.360]  Right now they are marching across Europe between Lithuania, Britain, even Greece.
[13:39.360 --> 13:44.240]  Google Street View and the local tax authorities have partnered up to catch citizens who might
[13:44.240 --> 13:46.040]  be evading taxes.
[13:46.040 --> 13:51.440]  In fact, the Lithuanian Tax Office has created their own iPhone app so that citizens can
[13:51.440 --> 13:53.240]  easily report on each other.
[13:53.240 --> 13:58.560]  The Lithuanian Tax Inspectorate says, we realized we could do more with less and in a shorter
[13:58.560 --> 13:59.560]  time.
[13:59.560 --> 14:03.160]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars are being collected out of an already cash-strapped
[14:03.160 --> 14:05.160]  European public.
[14:05.160 --> 14:11.880]  This year, over 2,500 citizens turned in other citizens for tax evasion.
[14:11.880 --> 14:16.800]  So this brings a whole new meaning to see something, say something.
[14:16.800 --> 14:20.520]  Look out, the Google Gestapo is coming to a city near you.
[14:20.520 --> 14:23.240]  Go to PrismPlanet.tv and sign up.
[14:23.240 --> 14:26.560]  You can share your username and password with up to 10 people.
[14:26.560 --> 14:29.560]  I'm Gigi Arnetta, reporting for Infowars.com.
[14:29.560 --> 14:33.840]  Great report from Gigi.
[14:33.840 --> 14:38.160]  Now at Bilderberg, it's reported in the Guardian that David Cameron, the Prime Minister of
[14:38.160 --> 14:42.760]  the UK, is going to attend Bilderberg Group Meeting, says Downing Street, defends visit
[14:42.760 --> 14:46.560]  to secretive group where Prime Minister will not be accompanied by civil servants.
[14:46.560 --> 14:51.840]  It says, number 10, it's clarifying the position because ministers are usually expected to
[14:51.840 --> 14:56.160]  be accompanied by civil service note-takers when they meet business leaders.
[14:56.160 --> 15:00.240]  Yeah, it's kind of like we have laws here about lobbying as well, and there's a huge
[15:00.240 --> 15:01.920]  scandal going on in the UK.
[15:01.920 --> 15:09.600]  We had three House of Lords members that were set up in a journalistic scam being seen to
[15:09.600 --> 15:15.680]  accept bribes for influence peddling that just resigned last weekend.
[15:15.680 --> 15:19.040]  Prior to that, same thing happened to a conservative MP.
[15:19.040 --> 15:23.720]  We've had our Jack Abramoff scandals, but of course, we're being told by the mainstream
[15:23.720 --> 15:26.440]  media that it's nothing to worry about.
[15:26.440 --> 15:27.440]  Just move along.
[15:27.440 --> 15:33.200]  When we see reports that are coming out now, we're seeing mainstream media reporting about
[15:33.200 --> 15:37.200]  Bilderberg because they look absolutely ridiculous not to.
[15:37.200 --> 15:40.880]  Now that Alex Jones is getting a lot of attention and Drudge has been reporting this for the
[15:40.880 --> 15:45.120]  last couple of years, people know that this is happening.
[15:45.120 --> 15:46.120]  It's gaining momentum.
[15:46.120 --> 15:51.960]  It's got enough exposure that when the mainstream media doesn't cover it, they look duplicitous.
[15:51.960 --> 15:53.360]  They look stupid.
[15:53.360 --> 15:54.720]  People are understanding that they're controlled.
[15:54.720 --> 15:58.960]  And of course, for years, the owners of the mainstream media have been attending Bilderberg
[15:58.960 --> 16:00.720]  and keeping their reporters away.
[16:00.720 --> 16:05.800]  Now, we've actually got a report from CNN's Jake Tapper that we'll play later on.
[16:05.800 --> 16:10.280]  I want to play some other stuff here first, but Jake Tapper went and talked about how
[16:10.280 --> 16:14.920]  this is an unreported story, finally covering it after 59 years.
[16:14.920 --> 16:19.480]  CNN is covering, of course, you've had high-level executives that have been in attendance, but
[16:19.480 --> 16:20.880]  they're not covering this.
[16:20.880 --> 16:26.400]  And then they like to basically throw any cold water on the idea that anything of significance
[16:26.400 --> 16:28.320]  is going on there.
[16:28.320 --> 16:31.000]  That of course is still just a conspiracy theory.
[16:31.000 --> 16:37.160]  And of course, they criticize Alex for talking about something that for years they told you
[16:37.160 --> 16:40.960]  it was a conspiracy theory if you said the Bilderberg existed.
[16:40.960 --> 16:46.400]  Now it's a conspiracy theory if you say anything is happening there that is of any consequence.
[16:46.400 --> 16:50.480]  Just amazing how they keep spinning this, but that's what's happening now at this point.
[16:50.480 --> 16:56.840]  Now, Alex, as I said earlier, is just this morning, not too long ago, he barged into
[16:56.840 --> 17:00.360]  Bilderberg attacking it by water.
[17:00.360 --> 17:02.760]  And we've got a live feed from Ustream there.
[17:02.760 --> 17:03.760]  We're going to play a little bit of that.
[17:03.760 --> 17:07.800]  He's having some fun bullhorning the people at Bilderberg.
[17:07.800 --> 17:08.800]  Let's go to that clip.
[17:08.800 --> 17:22.400]  All right, guys, it's happened.
[17:52.400 --> 18:22.240]  Well there's Alex having a lot of fun.
[18:22.240 --> 18:28.280]  He loves to do that sort of thing and we love to see him do it and nobody can do that
[18:28.280 --> 18:29.280]  like Alex.
[18:29.280 --> 18:35.080]  You know it's important to have passion as well as to tell the truth and Alex does that
[18:35.080 --> 18:36.080]  really well.
[18:36.080 --> 18:41.600]  Now of course people like Jake Tapper will take things like that out of context.
[18:41.600 --> 18:46.440]  It's very easy when somebody has a lot of passion about an issue to go in and Alex will
[18:46.440 --> 18:53.000]  talk about an issue for an entire segment, 10, 15 minutes and get very worked up about
[18:53.000 --> 18:54.000]  the injustice of it.
[18:54.000 --> 18:55.000]  And that's the question.
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.720]  It's like who's going to get worked up about these massive data leaks?
[18:59.720 --> 19:07.880]  There's an article here from RT and they interview a fellow named Afshan Ratanzi and he says
[19:07.880 --> 19:11.760]  I think one can get blasé about the fact that the US is repeatedly breaking its own
[19:11.760 --> 19:12.760]  constitution.
[19:12.760 --> 19:16.200]  Yeah, you know that's what I see happening here.
[19:16.200 --> 19:21.720]  We see things like it was not that long ago that Jeff Sessions was talking to Leon Panetta
[19:21.720 --> 19:26.840]  who was the Secretary of Defense and he was talking to him about who has the authority
[19:26.840 --> 19:32.600]  to declare war and trying to get Leon Panetta to say that he was going to come to Congress
[19:32.600 --> 19:35.920]  and he was going to have Congress declare war.
[19:35.920 --> 19:41.440]  Panetta absolutely refused to do it and Jeff Sessions was absolutely amazed and yet he
[19:41.440 --> 19:47.320]  couldn't get the outrage, he couldn't get in his face and guess what, if you can't get
[19:47.320 --> 19:50.000]  the outrage, you can't get a backbone, get in their face, you're not going to do anything
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  about it.
[19:51.000 --> 20:00.560]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones who has a passion about things, they too.
[20:00.560 --> 20:04.320]  American gardeners and fellow patriots make the right choice with your money, time and
[20:04.320 --> 20:05.680]  your family food supply.

[20:24.160 --> 20:27.480]  You could buy three survival seed vaults for less than one of theirs.
[20:27.480 --> 20:32.200]  The survival seed vault from MyPatriotSupply.com includes detailed planting and seed saving
[20:32.200 --> 20:34.120]  instructions and ships same day.
[20:34.120 --> 20:36.920]  Plus, all orders over $49 ship free.

[21:00.000 --> 21:04.080]  When you need it the most, will your generator power equipment or vehicle be ready?
[21:04.080 --> 21:08.720]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored and more than half of generator failures during
[21:08.720 --> 21:11.600]  disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.
[21:11.600 --> 21:15.840]  PRI fuel stabilizers keep your fuel fresh for when you need it most.
[21:15.840 --> 21:20.560]  Nuclear power stations, emergency service providers and ships at sea rely on PRI fuel
[21:20.560 --> 21:22.680]  stabilizers and you can too.
[21:22.680 --> 21:29.600]  Call 888-776-9373 or visit PRIproducts.com to find the dealer nearest you.
[21:29.600 --> 21:33.760]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[21:33.760 --> 21:37.960]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[21:37.960 --> 21:38.960]  to serve as debt.
[21:38.960 --> 21:42.440]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public
[21:42.440 --> 21:45.720]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[21:45.720 --> 21:50.000]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.240]  Call for your copy, 800-686-2237.
[21:53.240 --> 22:00.120]  It's time to understand the system, call 800-686-2237, that's 800-686-2237.
[22:00.120 --> 22:05.640]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms, but if you don't have a home security system
[22:05.640 --> 22:09.520]  then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[22:09.520 --> 22:13.440]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[22:13.440 --> 22:19.360]  Check out Simply Safe, it's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[22:22.240 --> 22:26.960]  Simply Safe is independent and off the grid, it runs on battery power so even if the grid
[22:26.960 --> 22:29.160]  goes down, you're protected.
[22:29.160 --> 22:33.960]  It's completely customizable, so you can use it in your home, business, boat, trailer,
[22:33.960 --> 22:35.840]  storage unit or shed.

[22:43.040 --> 22:45.400]  need to let a stranger into your home.

[22:49.480 --> 22:53.440]  You aren't always at home, but Simply Safe will stand guard protecting your property
[22:53.440 --> 22:56.320]  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[22:56.320 --> 23:03.480]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com.
[23:03.480 --> 23:08.880]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year.
[23:08.880 --> 23:14.760]  Burglars call it smash and grab, police call it robbery, we call it avoidable.
[23:14.760 --> 23:20.880]  We are FAKE TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[23:20.880 --> 23:26.200]  FAKE TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[23:26.200 --> 23:30.800]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move
[23:30.800 --> 23:33.400]  on to an easier target.
[23:33.400 --> 23:39.160]  At only $29.95, FAKE TV costs less than a month of most alarm-monitoring plans and comes
[23:39.160 --> 23:40.440]  with free shipping.
[23:40.440 --> 23:47.480]  Order your FAKE TV by calling 877-5 FAKE TV or go to FAKETV.com.
[23:47.480 --> 23:53.640]  That's 877-532-5388 or FAKETV.com.
[23:53.640 --> 24:00.400]  FAKE TV, the burglar deterrent.
[24:00.400 --> 24:08.200]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[24:08.200 --> 24:12.320]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[24:12.320 --> 24:17.840]  With all the news from 2013 Bilderberg in London, here is Alex Jones.
[24:17.840 --> 24:26.160]  That's right, if you want to follow all the news that's happening at Bilderberg, go to
[24:26.160 --> 24:28.880]  infowars.com forward slash B.
[24:28.880 --> 24:32.840]  I'm David Knight, I'm standing in for Alex Jones, he's going to be joining us at the
[24:32.840 --> 24:39.160]  top of the hour with David Ike, breaking interview there, live in London.
[24:39.160 --> 24:46.040]  Now CNN finally covered Bilderberg and we had a caller yesterday who said he had actually
[24:46.040 --> 24:52.000]  sent some Twitter messages to Jake and Jake was kind of brusque with him and pushed back
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.440]  kind of at the assumption that he was going to cover Bilderberg when he was getting ready.
[24:56.440 --> 24:59.960]  Now I guess he was already working on the report, let's cut to a little bit of that
[24:59.960 --> 25:01.200]  report right now.
[25:01.200 --> 25:05.600]  Now if you're thinking this is just another cabal of the people who secretly run the world,
[25:05.600 --> 25:12.200]  so does noted author, provocateur and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones from Infowars.
[25:12.200 --> 25:15.560]  Magna Carta has been restricted for the scum globalists that are in there.
[25:15.560 --> 25:18.720]  Jones is broadcasting live from the conference this week.
[25:18.720 --> 25:20.720]  They want you dead, Governor.
[25:20.720 --> 25:21.720]  Why?
[25:21.720 --> 25:23.000]  They're out to kill me.
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.200]  There are pretty nutty conspiracy theories about the group abound, they're hiding the
[25:27.200 --> 25:33.080]  cure for cancer for example, but just because bigfoot believers who are often offensively
[25:33.080 --> 25:38.760]  wrong or on the case here does not mean there isn't reason for the rest of us to be wary,
[25:38.760 --> 25:44.200]  as these masters of the universe confab away from cameras.
[25:44.200 --> 25:49.040]  The conference wraps up on Sunday and organizers say there will be no resolutions or votes
[25:49.040 --> 25:50.680]  and no policy statements.
[25:50.680 --> 25:54.040]  I think we'd be very naive to think that all of these people are going to turn up to a
[25:54.040 --> 25:55.840]  meeting and it has some effect.
[25:55.840 --> 25:59.200]  Gerard Batten is a member of the European Parliament for London.
[25:59.200 --> 26:03.560]  I'm sure that they are actually reaching decisions about which way public policies should be
[26:03.560 --> 26:09.040]  going in the countries that are represented and of course in the European Union.
[26:09.040 --> 26:13.520]  Now we have a very good interview with Gerard Batten from UKIP that's going to be coming
[26:13.520 --> 26:18.360]  up where Alex interviewed him yesterday and we're going to be playing that, but that's
[26:18.360 --> 26:22.240]  going to be in the next segment, it's a fairly long interview, very substantive, it's not
[26:22.240 --> 26:26.520]  going to be just a sound bite there, but do you notice what Jake Tapper and CNN are doing?
[26:26.520 --> 26:33.120]  Like I said before in the last segment, they can no longer ignore that Bilderberg is happening,
[26:33.120 --> 26:34.440]  they look stupid.
[26:34.440 --> 26:37.160]  So now they've taken another tag.
[26:37.160 --> 26:41.040]  Instead of saying that Alex is right, they essentially kind of throw a backhanded compliment
[26:41.040 --> 26:47.080]  saying essentially, well a broken clock can be right two times a day, essentially what
[26:47.080 --> 26:52.080]  he said, just because they're wild eyed conspiracy theorists and lunatics doesn't mean they can't
[26:52.080 --> 26:56.000]  be right about Bilderberg meeting here, but of course there's nothing really going on
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.080]  probably, that's right.
[26:59.080 --> 27:02.520]  Don't look at what happened with the European Union, don't look at what happened with the
[27:02.520 --> 27:08.240]  Euro, just ignore all of these plans, ignore the fact that you've got massive scandals
[27:08.240 --> 27:13.080]  of influence peddling happening in the United States as well as Britain, and yet you've
[27:13.080 --> 27:17.920]  got these most powerful companies and leaders of Bilderberg like Prince Bernhardt who have
[27:17.920 --> 27:22.360]  been involved in scandals of influence peddling in the past.
[27:22.360 --> 27:26.120]  Just ignore all of that and say that there's nothing happening here.
[27:26.120 --> 27:29.480]  That's the tactic that the mainstream media is taking right now.
[27:29.480 --> 27:35.160]  And we've also just learned that there's a live press report from Obama where he's talking
[27:35.160 --> 27:38.800]  about the leak of information I guess from Verizon.
[27:38.800 --> 27:42.400]  I don't know if he's talking about the spying that's going on to the internet firms.
[27:42.400 --> 27:48.400]  Every day it's another scandal, and the criticism that we've seen so far, the reactions that
[27:48.400 --> 27:51.200]  we've seen so far is for the White House to defend this.
[27:51.200 --> 27:56.280]  And we've actually seen the NSA supervisor, there we've got a video feed of it.
[27:56.280 --> 28:01.080]  Let's go to the audio here and see what they're saying briefly.
[28:01.080 --> 28:11.800]  And indicate why, in fact, they were doing further probing with respect to the internet.
[28:11.800 --> 28:14.240]  And emails.
[28:14.240 --> 28:18.840]  This does not apply to U.S. citizens, and it does not apply to people living in the
[28:18.840 --> 28:22.200]  United States.
[28:22.200 --> 28:29.160]  And again, in this instance, not only is Congress fully apprised of it, but what is also true
[28:29.160 --> 28:32.480]  is that the FISA court has to authorize it.
[28:32.480 --> 28:33.600]  That's not true.
[28:33.600 --> 28:38.280]  The FISA law applies to foreign citizens, but in this case, as was reported yesterday,
[28:38.280 --> 28:42.040]  they specifically excluded foreign phones.
[28:42.040 --> 28:47.360]  They went strictly after domestic phones, continue on with this.
[28:47.360 --> 28:51.640]  Bipartisan majorities have approved them.
[28:51.640 --> 28:55.520]  Congress is continually briefed on how these are conducted.
[28:55.520 --> 29:02.000]  There are a whole range of safeguards involved, and federal judges are overseeing the entire
[29:02.000 --> 29:04.440]  program throughout.
[29:04.440 --> 29:12.360]  We've also set up an audit process, when I came into office, to make sure that we're
[29:12.360 --> 29:16.000]  after the fact, making absolutely certain that all safeguards are being provided.
[29:16.000 --> 29:23.480]  So what he's saying here is that as long as Congress is watching them spy on us, it's
[29:23.480 --> 29:25.960]  okay because they're watching.
[29:25.960 --> 29:31.680]  Our watchers are looking at this and approving illegal, unlawful activity.
[29:31.680 --> 29:34.080]  So that makes it okay as long as they're watching.
[29:34.080 --> 29:38.160]  We just had the U.S. Intelligence Chief denounce this release of information.
[29:38.160 --> 29:43.200]  Not the fact that they were releasing information about customers, but releasing the fact that
[29:43.200 --> 29:44.520]  they were collecting the information.
[29:44.520 --> 29:49.560]  Yes, we're going to talk about that right after the break, stay tuned.
[29:49.560 --> 29:53.280]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[29:53.280 --> 30:23.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:23.240 --> 30:51.240]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[30:51.240 --> 31:16.200]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[31:16.200 --> 31:42.000]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[31:42.000 --> 32:10.800]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[32:10.800 --> 32:39.400]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[32:39.400 --> 33:04.880]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[33:10.400 --> 33:12.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:12.480 --> 33:14.080]  I'm David Knight filling in for Alex.
[33:14.080 --> 33:18.880]  Now, Alex is going to be joining us at eight after the hour, and he's going to be joined
[33:18.880 --> 33:23.280]  live with David Ike for the first time together in a single studio.
[33:23.280 --> 33:28.120]  They're going to be having a live interview at eight after, so stay tuned for that.
[33:28.120 --> 33:33.880]  Now, to fund this information and to fund this trip here, we've got a couple of specials
[33:33.880 --> 33:38.640]  you might want to take advantage of on infowarsstore.com.
[33:38.640 --> 33:44.440]  We've got a Bilderberg special on pro pure water filters, 15% off through, I believe
[33:44.440 --> 33:49.280]  it's the ninth, the end of Bilderberg, so take advantage of that.
[33:49.280 --> 33:51.280]  And also the survival seed vault.
[33:51.280 --> 33:55.880]  Now, one thing that's really key about the survival seed vault is the heirloom seeds.
[33:55.880 --> 34:04.080]  Now, even before GMO became an issue, grocery stores and growers started selectively breeding
[34:04.080 --> 34:09.880]  fruit and to look better, to last longer.
[34:09.880 --> 34:12.280]  And sometimes that happened at the expense of taste.
[34:12.280 --> 34:14.080]  I mean, they even did that with roses.
[34:14.080 --> 34:19.000]  Roses don't have the kind of fragrance that they once had because they started selectively
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.360]  breeding those for appearance, and they're doing the same thing with a lot of the fruit
[34:24.360 --> 34:25.360]  that you buy.
[34:25.360 --> 34:29.880]  If you want some stuff that really tastes great, get some heirloom seeds.
[34:29.880 --> 34:33.800]  And it's also something that's very important for your health.
[34:33.800 --> 34:36.200]  We can't control the Supreme Court.
[34:36.200 --> 34:40.800]  These nine politically appointed judges just said that Monsanto can do anything that they
[34:40.800 --> 34:41.800]  want to.
[34:41.800 --> 34:46.720]  They can trespass with their pollen and their seed on other farmers' property.
[34:46.720 --> 34:51.320]  And if that happens, those farmers have to pay Monsanto for the trespass and the contamination
[34:51.320 --> 34:55.240]  of their products with Monsanto's genetically modified seed.
[34:55.240 --> 35:01.840]  And understand the difference between genetically modified stuff versus something that is selectively
[35:01.840 --> 35:02.840]  bred.
[35:02.840 --> 35:06.600]  There's a genetic variation that you get within dogs, but they're still dogs.
[35:06.600 --> 35:08.120]  You're still breeding dogs to dogs.
[35:08.120 --> 35:14.640]  Now, if you take a dog and you mix in the genes of, let's say, a spider, or you mix
[35:14.640 --> 35:20.200]  this so they can do something with webs, I don't know, or take a firefly so that your
[35:20.200 --> 35:23.720]  dog glows in the dark so you don't lose them when he goes out at night.
[35:23.720 --> 35:25.800]  That's the kind of stuff we're talking about with GMO.
[35:25.800 --> 35:27.360]  Has tremendous health consequences.
[35:27.360 --> 35:31.160]  As we saw last summer, the French did an experiment with rats.
[35:31.160 --> 35:35.440]  Got massive tumors from eating GMO, it's being banned in Europe.
[35:35.440 --> 35:38.320]  Well, it's creeping into your grocery supply.
[35:38.320 --> 35:43.040]  And over and over again, we see that we cannot rely on the people in Washington or government
[35:43.040 --> 35:44.040]  to protect us.
[35:44.040 --> 35:45.560]  We have to do it ourselves.
[35:45.560 --> 35:50.240]  That's true whether you're talking about fully informed juries who are going to veto bad
[35:50.240 --> 35:55.000]  laws locally, taking the responsibility, having the backbone to do it themselves, or we're
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.740]  talking about your food supply, making sure your water is clean and unadulterated, making
[35:59.740 --> 36:04.400]  sure that your seeds are real seeds, not some kind of franken food.
[36:04.400 --> 36:06.160]  You can do that with a survival seed bank.
[36:06.160 --> 36:09.400]  You can do that with the proprio filters.
[36:09.400 --> 36:14.320]  And it helps to fund this operation, of course, because it does need money to run to send
[36:14.320 --> 36:20.480]  people to Europe to cover Bilderberg as well as to operate on a daily basis just here from
[36:20.480 --> 36:21.480]  Austin.
[36:21.480 --> 36:28.360]  Now, Alex is in Europe in London, and he talked yesterday to a UKIP party member, Gerard
[36:28.360 --> 36:31.560]  Batten, very good interview about Bilderberg.
[36:31.560 --> 36:35.400]  Like I said before, he's going to be on it eight after talking to David Ike.
[36:35.400 --> 36:39.280]  But let's take a look at this interview he had yesterday with Gerard Batten.
[36:39.280 --> 36:40.600]  My name is Gerard Batten.
[36:40.600 --> 36:44.640]  I'm a member of the European Parliament for London for the UK Independence Party.
[36:44.640 --> 36:48.240]  And we're here today outside the Grove Hotel where they're having the Bilderberg meeting
[36:48.240 --> 36:52.080]  because I'm one of those many people from many different political points of view who
[36:52.080 --> 36:55.360]  are asking the question, what are these people meeting for?
[36:55.360 --> 36:59.240]  I think this year is very significant because it's the first year in 59 years that we've
[36:59.240 --> 37:03.880]  actually got members of the mainstream press and media turning up to actually interview
[37:03.880 --> 37:07.880]  people like me and Alex Jones who's here and filming me today and asking what's going
[37:07.880 --> 37:08.880]  on.
[37:08.880 --> 37:10.080]  That's a major breakthrough.
[37:10.080 --> 37:14.720]  And I think that the reason that people are very upset about this is because they don't
[37:14.720 --> 37:17.440]  know what the conclusions are of these meetings.
[37:17.440 --> 37:21.760]  Now, they say they don't have any conclusions, but are we really supposed to believe that
[37:21.760 --> 37:27.680]  130, 140 people of the most powerful, richest, influential people in the world give up their
[37:27.680 --> 37:32.200]  time, fly across the world to come here and it doesn't have a significance?
[37:32.200 --> 37:33.400]  I don't believe that for a minute.
[37:33.400 --> 37:35.400]  If it isn't significant, why would they come?
[37:35.400 --> 37:37.680]  If it is significant, what does it all mean?
[37:37.680 --> 37:41.240]  And I think the reason that party like mine, the UK Independence Party, is soaring ahead
[37:41.240 --> 37:45.760]  in the polls and getting votes is because people now feel that politics is something
[37:45.760 --> 37:49.440]  that's done to them and not something that's done for them.
[37:49.440 --> 37:51.740]  And this is the heart of the malaise.
[37:51.740 --> 37:55.440]  People feel that it doesn't matter what they think, it doesn't matter what they believe,
[37:55.440 --> 37:59.160]  they're going to have these policies that they won't trust down their throat anyway.
[37:59.160 --> 38:02.120]  And this is where my party is different, whether you agree with us or not.
[38:02.120 --> 38:05.360]  A lot of people feel that we're sincere and we actually stand for certain things and that's
[38:05.360 --> 38:06.920]  why they're voting for us.
[38:06.920 --> 38:10.520]  I heard you speaking with the London Telegraph just a few minutes ago, and you've obviously
[38:10.520 --> 38:15.400]  done your research because it's been declassified, the CIA funded the creation of the European
[38:15.400 --> 38:16.400]  Union.
[38:16.400 --> 38:20.800]  UKIP is the fastest growing party obviously now in the UK in the last elections because
[38:20.800 --> 38:24.520]  you guys talk about how you're losing your sovereignty and how you've got EU license
[38:24.520 --> 38:30.040]  plates and 80% of your laws are so are EU and you don't get a vote on it.
[38:30.040 --> 38:34.400]  But again, it's a corporate group that took over America, created the UN, created all
[38:34.400 --> 38:35.400]  this.
[38:35.400 --> 38:39.640]  It's not even really America, but it was the CIA kind of this corporate body that's
[38:39.640 --> 38:44.920]  anti-free market kind of monopoly men that did set up the EU to get rid of the sovereignty
[38:44.920 --> 38:45.920]  of Europe.
[38:45.920 --> 38:48.840]  I mean, if Hitler would have come up with a corporate plan to take over, we'd all be
[38:48.840 --> 38:56.800] ... He did because in actual fact that in 1942, the German central bank under Dr. Walter
[38:56.800 --> 39:00.240]  Funk, along with leading industrialists, set to how we're going to run the economy
[39:00.240 --> 39:02.960]  of Europe after we've won the war because at that time...
[39:02.960 --> 39:03.960]  You know your stuff.
[39:03.960 --> 39:07.960]  The EU is a Nazi... Europe, Peitscher, Wietzsch, Gemeinschaft, the European
[39:07.960 --> 39:12.000]  Economic Community, that's what they called it, and it had a common agricultural policy,
[39:12.000 --> 39:13.960]  a common this policy, a common that policy.
[39:13.960 --> 39:18.800]  I haven't done enough research on this, but I'd be willing to bet that some of the civil
[39:18.800 --> 39:22.480]  servants that drew that plan up actually found jobs 10 or 15 years later.
[39:22.480 --> 39:25.360]  Prince Bernhard was an SS officer, and he was the founder.
[39:25.360 --> 39:27.040]  And Queen Bernhard of the Netherlands is here?
[39:27.040 --> 39:28.800]  Oh, the Queen of the Netherlands is here.
[39:28.800 --> 39:29.800]  And her son is about to be king.
[39:29.800 --> 39:31.320]  Yeah, and she comes to every one of these men.
[39:31.320 --> 39:35.800]  Okay, so specifically though, talking about the 60s and that vote and the CIA funding
[39:35.800 --> 39:36.800]  of the Europe.
[39:36.800 --> 39:40.960]  Well, 1975 is the last time that we had a referendum in this country, and it wasn't
[39:40.960 --> 39:44.960]  about joining the EU because Ted Heath had already taken his in with no mandate, no
[39:44.960 --> 39:46.960]  democratic mandate to do it.
[39:46.960 --> 39:49.200]  This is a trade deal, just like in the US, we're under free trade.
[39:49.200 --> 39:52.200]  That's what they told us, but everybody who knew anything about it knew that wasn't the
[39:52.200 --> 39:53.200]  case anyway.
[39:53.200 --> 39:56.680]  But anyway, we got in, Harold Wilson won an election, said, I'll give you a referendum
[39:56.680 --> 40:01.800]  on the EU, and it was about whether we should accept his renegotiated terms, stay in or
[40:01.800 --> 40:03.300]  get out.
[40:03.300 --> 40:09.200]  And about, we don't know the exact figures, but the CIA put money into the Yes campaign,
[40:09.200 --> 40:15.320]  the BBC had meetings every day to make sure that there was a yes vote delivered, major
[40:15.320 --> 40:17.560]  organs of the press were involved in that.
[40:17.560 --> 40:22.320]  So the no vote were totally outspent and outclassed in terms of a campaign.
[40:22.320 --> 40:26.240]  So is this not a corporate takeover via EU government?
[40:26.240 --> 40:29.400]  Well, that was the CIA, so presumably they get their money from the government.
[40:29.400 --> 40:33.360]  So I see this as an instrument of American foreign policy at the time, because as Henry
[40:33.360 --> 40:36.840]  Kissing just said, who do I talk to when I want to ring Europe?
[40:36.840 --> 40:40.720]  He doesn't want to ring 20-odd individual nation states and have to worry about dealing
[40:40.720 --> 40:41.720]  with them.
[40:41.720 --> 40:45.120]  He wants to deal with one centralized authority, the United States of Europe.
[40:45.120 --> 40:48.000]  So I see this as your corporate idea may well be very valid.
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.960]  Well, sure, it's Bilderberg that gives the orders in the US, though.
[40:50.960 --> 40:55.240]  It's the main contingent as Americans and Brits, and in some EU, we've gotten their
[40:55.240 --> 40:56.880]  minutes, we've gotten their documents.
[40:56.880 --> 41:00.160]  They say what you just said, Carol Quigley, who was allowed into their minutes in the
[41:00.160 --> 41:04.440]  60s wrote Tragedy and Hope, and he said, Autocratic thing run by central bankers into
[41:04.440 --> 41:09.680]  freedom, controlling both major parties and countries, Democrat, Republican, Labor, Tory,
[41:09.680 --> 41:12.320]  creating the illusion of choice.
[41:12.320 --> 41:15.920]  The fact that UKIP's getting so popular, speaking out against the New World Order, they criticize
[41:15.920 --> 41:21.680]  you guys then, but only makes you more popular, does that signify that people are awakening
[41:21.680 --> 41:25.320]  and people like Nigel Farage and yourself are kind of the Ron Poles of Europe?
[41:25.320 --> 41:28.960]  Well, you know, I don't claim any great status myself.
[41:28.960 --> 41:31.560]  Basically what we're doing, I think, is asking the questions and trying to come up with some
[41:31.560 --> 41:32.560]  answers.
[41:32.560 --> 41:37.840]  And I think more and more people are aware that politics is not being run for their benefit.
[41:37.840 --> 41:41.000]  And you know, you talk about, people talk about this being a capitalist system.
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.440]  This isn't capitalism.
[41:42.440 --> 41:45.640]  Capitalism is supposed to be fair and open with a free market, and that's not what you're
[41:45.640 --> 41:49.920]  getting now in the modern world, where things are stitched up corporately, as you rightly
[41:49.920 --> 41:50.920]  point out.
[41:50.920 --> 41:55.440]  So isn't a crisis of capitalism, it's a crisis of democratic government and a fair economic
[41:55.440 --> 41:56.440]  system?
[41:56.440 --> 41:57.440]  Sure.
[41:57.440 --> 41:58.440]  Last question.
[41:58.440 --> 42:03.080]  This huge lobbying scandal, members of parliament resigning in thanks, isn't this the big lobbying
[42:03.080 --> 42:04.080]  scandal right here?
[42:04.080 --> 42:07.520]  They've gotten in trouble for criminal lobbying before, back in the 70s with the Lockheed Martin
[42:07.520 --> 42:08.520]  scandal in Prince Bernard.
[42:08.520 --> 42:12.160]  Well, I think that George Osborne, who's here, who's a minister of the government, as indeed
[42:12.160 --> 42:17.040]  Kenny Clarke, may well be in breach of the ministerial rules, because they're lays down
[42:17.040 --> 42:19.720]  that they're supposed to be open about who they're talking to, and particularly with
[42:19.720 --> 42:22.120]  members of the press, they're supposed to log every meeting.
[42:22.120 --> 42:26.600]  And you've got people here who own vast swathes of the media in one way or another, so I think
[42:26.600 --> 42:30.640]  there may well be some questions asked, but I wouldn't hold out much hope of actually
[42:30.640 --> 42:32.160]  anything being done about it.
[42:32.160 --> 42:35.480]  Is UKIP going to call for criminal investigations of this?
[42:35.480 --> 42:37.880]  Well, I think what we do, when I get back to my office, I'm going to be looking at the
[42:37.880 --> 42:42.880]  rules in detail and writing to David Cameron and raising the issues that I think are relevant.
[42:42.880 --> 42:43.880]  So we'll do our best.
[42:43.880 --> 42:48.120]  But I've written many letters, Alex, a lot of them getting ignored and don't often actually
[42:48.120 --> 42:49.680]  result in much action.
[42:49.680 --> 42:52.480]  But big things have small beginnings.
[42:52.480 --> 42:58.760]  If you could speak for one minute to the Bilderberg attendees, the royalty, the corporate barons,
[42:58.760 --> 43:03.040]  the government regulators, the EU bureaucrats that are arriving with people that they regulate,
[43:03.040 --> 43:08.760]  if you could say one minute of words to them, as a member of the European Union Parliament,
[43:08.760 --> 43:09.760]  what would you say to them?
[43:09.760 --> 43:14.200]  I would say, if you were really here to talk about things in the public interest, which
[43:14.200 --> 43:18.680]  is what they maintain, why do you think you can achieve it in secrecy?
[43:18.680 --> 43:20.960]  Why wouldn't you achieve more by being public?
[43:20.960 --> 43:25.000]  OK, you could have a discussion about what the problems are and the solutions in private,
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.480]  but any decisions that you arrive at, any policy recommendations should be in public
[43:29.480 --> 43:32.280]  because you need to take the public with you.
[43:32.280 --> 43:35.480]  And obviously, they're not doing that because the public wouldn't want to go on the trip
[43:35.480 --> 43:37.000]  that they've got planned for them.
[43:37.000 --> 43:40.680]  But I'd ask them to do that, if it's genuine, be open and honest about it.
[43:40.680 --> 43:44.320]  Because what people feel now is that, as I said earlier, politics is not something that's
[43:44.320 --> 43:46.240]  done for them, it's done to them.
[43:46.240 --> 43:50.440]  You had a great point, though, about how if they don't have any power, why would they
[43:50.440 --> 43:54.520]  be traveling from all over the world in great expense and secrecy and paying for part of
[43:54.520 --> 43:57.920]  the millions of pounds they spend here if this didn't have any power?
[43:57.920 --> 44:01.400]  And we have so many other minutes where they set up the euro.
[44:01.400 --> 44:06.200]  They bragged, they created the brain trust in 54 with the trade agreements, Treaty of
[44:06.200 --> 44:12.760]  Rome, Treaty of London, and then later the votes to hoodwink people into this undemocratic
[44:12.760 --> 44:15.120]  system where the EU bureaucrats are above the law.
[44:15.120 --> 44:16.120]  Well, exactly.
[44:16.120 --> 44:19.560]  I mean, Alex, even as prominent and important as person as you are, I'm sure you'd find
[44:19.560 --> 44:21.960]  it difficult to get 10 minutes in George Osborne's diary.
[44:21.960 --> 44:22.960]  Absolutely.
[44:22.960 --> 44:27.680]  But he can come here and spend two or three days away from his desk, away from his onerous
[44:27.680 --> 44:29.280]  responsibilities and spend it.
[44:29.280 --> 44:30.880]  He wouldn't do that unless it was important.
[44:30.880 --> 44:34.200]  And neither would any of these other people, so it must be very important or they wouldn't
[44:34.200 --> 44:35.200]  do it.
[44:35.200 --> 44:36.800]  I don't believe it's just a talking shop.
[44:36.800 --> 44:39.520]  These people don't have time to waste.
[44:39.520 --> 44:42.760]  They will only do it if it's significant and there's a real reason for doing it.
[44:42.760 --> 44:44.520]  This is the last question I know you've got to go.
[44:44.520 --> 44:47.840]  It's just so amazing to talk to a member of the EU Parliament who's exposing it from
[44:47.840 --> 44:50.720]  the inside.
[44:50.720 --> 44:53.840]  Looking at this whole event, every time the BBC or the London Telegraph or any of them
[44:53.840 --> 44:57.960]  come up and talk to me or they talk to you, they say, are you a conspiracy theorist?
[44:57.960 --> 45:01.840]  For a long time, they said this didn't even exist, now we force them to report it and
[45:01.840 --> 45:06.360]  then we're somehow bad that we're wanting to know what policy is being made in there
[45:06.360 --> 45:10.280]  by this shadowy group and we have WikiLeaks documents from Bilderberg, they've confirmed
[45:10.280 --> 45:14.560]  a reel where Kissinger says, illegal we do immediately, unconstitutional takes longer.
[45:14.560 --> 45:17.400]  I mean, this is a guy known for war crimes.
[45:17.400 --> 45:18.400]  Yeah.
[45:18.400 --> 45:19.800]  I'm sorry, I forgot what your question was there.
[45:19.800 --> 45:20.800]  I'm sorry.
[45:20.800 --> 45:24.440]  What do you say about them using that throwaway term of conspiracy?
[45:24.440 --> 45:27.600]  Well, what I say, what's the definition of a conspiracy?
[45:27.600 --> 45:31.040]  There's two or more people meeting in secret to achieve an end, which might be illegal
[45:31.040 --> 45:32.040]  or illegal.
[45:32.040 --> 45:35.720]  So in the strict use of the word, it is a conspiracy because we don't know what they're
[45:35.720 --> 45:39.200]  talking about unless they have no objective at all and it's just a friendly chat over
[45:39.200 --> 45:41.280]  a cup of tea which none of us believe.
[45:41.280 --> 45:45.400]  And I think the bigger conspiracy in inverted commas has been the fact that the media haven't
[45:45.400 --> 45:50.880]  spoken about this for 59 years and have allowed it to go on without any reporting.
[45:50.880 --> 45:54.200]  And I think that's the real conspiracy and now that let's hopefully that's come to an
[45:54.200 --> 45:56.880]  end and the media are actually going to look at what's going on.
[45:56.880 --> 46:00.440]  Wow, if it has no power, why was the media able to be shut up for so long?
[46:00.440 --> 46:02.240]  Well, they weren't shut up.
[46:02.240 --> 46:03.240]  Look who owns the media.
[46:03.240 --> 46:06.960]  The media is owned by powerful people and those same powerful people go to meetings
[46:06.960 --> 46:07.960]  like this.
[46:07.960 --> 46:10.640]  So, you know, in Britain, it's like in America, it's probably very similar.
[46:10.640 --> 46:15.680]  You've got a few powerful people that own newspapers or television stations and of course
[46:15.680 --> 46:19.400]  they ultimately decide what's reported and what's not.
[46:19.400 --> 46:20.400]  Sir, thank you so much.
[46:20.400 --> 46:22.880]  How do we visit the UKIP website?
[46:22.880 --> 46:32.400]  www.ukip.org or you can look at my website, which is Gerard, www.gerardbattenmep.co.uk.
[46:32.400 --> 46:34.880]  I want to thank you for coming out to this, sir.
[46:34.880 --> 46:35.880]  Thank you so much.
[46:35.880 --> 46:39.800]  And we've got members of the German Bundestag going public saying they've attended and it's
[46:39.800 --> 46:40.800]  evil.
[46:40.800 --> 46:43.400]  We've got members of the British Parliament that are coming out saying they attended and
[46:43.400 --> 46:44.960]  that it should be open.
[46:44.960 --> 46:47.720]  And now Bilderberg is really feeling the heat from our sources.
[46:47.720 --> 46:50.960]  Including the BBC guy, he went in there to have lunch with them.
[46:50.960 --> 46:55.360]  He told us on the phone that came out was interviewed by him and he admitted they're
[46:55.360 --> 46:58.000]  feeling incredible heat and may even have a press conference.
[46:58.000 --> 47:00.680]  So it is unprecedented the amount of heat they're feeling.
[47:00.680 --> 47:01.680]  They don't like it.
[47:01.680 --> 47:02.680]  Absolutely.
[47:02.680 --> 47:04.680]  Again, thank you, sir.
[47:04.680 --> 47:05.680]  All right, folks.
[47:05.680 --> 47:06.680]  Great job.
[47:06.680 --> 47:07.680]  Let's continue.
[47:07.680 --> 47:08.680]  It really starts to kick off now.
[47:08.680 --> 47:09.680]  That was a great interview.
[47:09.680 --> 47:14.240]  That's UKIP's Gerard Batten.
[47:14.240 --> 47:15.760]  It's not just Nigel Farage.
[47:15.760 --> 47:18.240]  They've got a whole group of Ron Pauls over there.
[47:18.240 --> 47:23.800]  I guess UKIP stands for United Kingdom Independent Pauls, but they've got a lot of guys who
[47:23.800 --> 47:25.840]  really know their stuff over there.
[47:25.840 --> 47:30.200]  And it was a great interview that Alex had with Gerard Batten of UKIP.
[47:30.200 --> 47:34.920]  Remember that at eight after, Alex is going to be interviewing David Ike live for the
[47:34.920 --> 47:35.920]  first time.
[47:35.920 --> 47:40.640]  The two of them are going to be together because Alex traveled to cover Bilderberg there.
[47:40.640 --> 47:43.240]  Now, like I said before, another day, another scandal.
[47:43.240 --> 47:45.880]  We've had Verizon coming out yesterday.
[47:45.880 --> 47:50.840]  The secret document that was leaked about that, as the Atlantic reports, the unknown
[47:50.840 --> 47:55.240]  patriot who exposed the government's Verizon spy program, they said, who is it?
[47:55.240 --> 47:56.240]  We don't really know.
[47:56.240 --> 47:58.080]  But it was still marked top secret.
[47:58.080 --> 48:05.360]  As a matter of fact, back in March, Clapper, who is the head of the NSA, James Clapper,
[48:05.360 --> 48:09.840]  director of national intelligence, denied that the NSA was doing any surveillance.
[48:09.840 --> 48:11.360]  He lied to the Senate.
[48:11.360 --> 48:13.080]  Hey, that sounds familiar, doesn't it?
[48:13.080 --> 48:18.240]  Kind of like the way the IRS lied to the Senate year after year about what they were
[48:18.240 --> 48:19.240]  doing.
[48:19.240 --> 48:21.600]  Now we got the NSA lying to the Senate.
[48:21.600 --> 48:24.760]  He was asked directly by Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon.
[48:24.760 --> 48:29.760]  And Ron Wyden has been very good in terms of coming after civil liberties violations.
[48:29.760 --> 48:31.080]  I got to give him credit for that.
[48:31.080 --> 48:32.760]  He's done an excellent job.
[48:32.760 --> 48:35.680]  He's been one of the few people to speak out against this stuff.
[48:35.680 --> 48:42.400]  He said to Clapper, does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds
[48:42.400 --> 48:44.880]  of millions of Americans?
[48:44.880 --> 48:48.360]  That's what he asked Clapper in a March 12 meeting.
[48:48.360 --> 48:51.920]  In response, Clapper replied quickly, no, sir.
[48:51.920 --> 48:56.080]  There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect intelligence on Americans,
[48:56.080 --> 49:00.000]  but not wittingly, said the U.S. intelligence chief.
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.480]  That said, particularly in the case of NSA and CIA, there are structures against tracking
[49:04.480 --> 49:07.800]  American citizens in the U.S. for foreign intelligence purposes.
[49:07.800 --> 49:10.600]  And yet we were told yesterday.
[49:10.600 --> 49:18.600]  It was reported that Americans were specifically targeted, foreigners were specifically excluded.
[49:18.600 --> 49:22.760]  Exactly the opposite of what Obama just said in his press conference.
[49:22.760 --> 49:28.440]  Now Clapper is still not telling the truth.
[49:28.440 --> 49:34.840]  He came out in defense of this and upset about the fact that information was released.
[49:34.840 --> 49:43.280]  Not upset about the fact that records on millions of Americans were released to spooks.
[49:43.280 --> 49:47.640]  But he's upset about the fact that anybody knows that that happened.
[49:47.640 --> 49:49.640]  He said, disclosures, this is on the Guardian.
[49:49.640 --> 49:53.800]  He said, it says, disclosure of the massive surveillance of phone records and internet
[49:53.800 --> 49:59.440]  communications risks, quote, long lasting and irreversible harm, unquote, to U.S. national
[49:59.440 --> 50:03.240]  security, said Clapper, director of national intelligence.
[50:03.240 --> 50:08.720]  Late on Thursday night, U.S. time, James Clapper issued a bullet point defense of the surveillance
[50:08.720 --> 50:12.160]  programs disclosed by the Guardian and the Washington Post saying that they contained,
[50:12.160 --> 50:16.480]  quote, numerous safeguards that protect privacy and civil liberties.
[50:16.480 --> 50:20.480]  How do you say that when you've had millions of these things released?
[50:20.480 --> 50:22.240]  Obviously that didn't work, right?
[50:22.240 --> 50:25.360]  And obviously it is not just Verizon, it's going to be everybody.
[50:25.360 --> 50:30.880]  And then today we have breaking information about Prism, where they're going in and looking
[50:30.880 --> 50:33.560]  at a lot more information.
[50:33.560 --> 50:36.080]  We'll talk about that coming up after the break.
[50:36.080 --> 50:42.640]  Alex has a great speech about Prism as part of an interview at Bilderberg.
[50:42.640 --> 50:44.880]  We're going to be possibly playing that later in the program.
[50:44.880 --> 50:45.880]  We'll see how that works out.
[50:45.880 --> 51:00.760]  But David Ike is coming up after the hour at 8 afters, so stay tuned.
[51:00.760 --> 51:02.160]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[51:02.160 --> 51:06.760]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts,
[51:06.760 --> 51:08.320]  and more into the bokashi.
[51:08.320 --> 51:11.700]  If you love to garden and compost but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin
[51:11.700 --> 51:16.400]  or this smell, then check out the EM bokashi food waste recycling system from Tarragonix.
[51:16.400 --> 51:20.800]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop
[51:20.800 --> 51:24.680]  using fertilizers, the EM bokashi food waste recycling system.
[51:24.680 --> 51:28.800]  Rather than decomposition, the bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste, so
[51:28.800 --> 51:33.040]  it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens with no turning
[51:33.040 --> 51:34.720]  and no obnoxious odors.
[51:34.720 --> 51:39.200]  To learn more and order your bokashi online, visit tarragonix.com and click on the orange
[51:39.200 --> 51:40.200]  button.

[51:58.080 --> 51:59.080]  Life's getting better.
[51:59.080 --> 52:03.760]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[52:03.760 --> 52:04.760]  Box.
[52:04.760 --> 52:07.680]  I want you to know some very important information.
[52:07.680 --> 52:12.480]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[52:12.480 --> 52:16.840]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[52:16.840 --> 52:22.400]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[52:22.400 --> 52:27.480]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[52:27.480 --> 52:32.600]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[52:32.600 --> 52:33.760]  normal cell.
[52:33.760 --> 52:37.440]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[52:37.440 --> 52:41.520]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[52:41.520 --> 52:45.840]  Call 1-866-VENUS-FLY or order from Carnivora.com.
[52:45.840 --> 52:49.440]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.
[52:49.440 --> 52:52.440]  That's 1-866-836-8735.
[52:52.440 --> 52:56.840]  1-866-VENUS-FLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[52:56.840 --> 52:57.840]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.
[52:57.840 --> 52:58.840]  It's the only one you've got.
[52:58.840 --> 53:03.000]  Hi, I'm Steve Scheng, founder of eFoodsDirect.
[53:03.000 --> 53:07.920]  Right now we have a huge number of Americans that are in serious trouble, right smack dab
[53:07.920 --> 53:10.320]  in the middle of the Oklahoma disasters.
[53:10.320 --> 53:15.000]  I know that thousands of you, like us, are frustrated with not being able to help those
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.840]  who have lost so much and are in so much pain.
[53:17.840 --> 53:19.960]  We can't stand idly by.
[53:19.960 --> 53:23.880]  Food is the best way to help the victims and support the relief effort.
[53:23.880 --> 53:28.080]  We have a plan for any of you who would like to partner with us in providing food in this
[53:28.080 --> 53:29.760]  desperate time of need.
[53:29.760 --> 53:35.080]  We've built a 7-day emergency food package containing breakfast, lunch and dinner for
[53:35.080 --> 53:39.160]  a whole week for one adult, valued at $60.
[53:39.160 --> 53:44.040]  Your $25 will ship this life-saving supply directly to those in need.
[53:44.040 --> 53:54.480]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com, that's 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com.
[53:54.480 --> 54:24.280]  The food is contributed at considerably less than cost, thank you.
[54:24.280 --> 54:27.640]  I wanted to finish up with what I was just talking about just before the break.
[54:27.640 --> 54:30.880]  I had one more quote I wanted to go over from James Clapper.
[54:30.880 --> 54:35.520]  Now, he is the Director of U.S. National Security.
[54:35.520 --> 54:40.960]  He went before the Senate, March 12th, lied about what they were doing.
[54:40.960 --> 54:48.720]  And then he is upset about the fact that this secret program of espionage on all Americans
[54:48.720 --> 54:49.880]  was disclosed.
[54:49.880 --> 54:53.280]  Well, we've been talking about it for a long time.
[54:53.280 --> 54:58.720]  People didn't believe us, but now that this is out in the news, we'll just have to see
[54:58.720 --> 54:59.720]  where this is headed.
[54:59.720 --> 55:01.120]  Hopefully, this will wake people up.
[55:01.120 --> 55:06.560]  I know when I came to work here at InfoWars, I had a couple of people tell me it was a
[55:06.560 --> 55:07.560]  dangerous thing.
[55:07.560 --> 55:09.280]  I was putting a target on my back.
[55:09.280 --> 55:10.280]  You know what?
[55:10.280 --> 55:12.880]  They've got a target on everybody's back.
[55:12.880 --> 55:15.200]  That's what I said at the time, and that is true.
[55:15.200 --> 55:18.200]  We already knew they were recording everybody's phone calls.
[55:18.200 --> 55:23.240]  They were setting up a massive data center so they could mine it in the future.
[55:23.240 --> 55:26.920]  Hopefully now, at this point, the best thing that could come out of it is people can get
[55:26.920 --> 55:33.480]  out of denial about the pervasive espionage of our government against everyone, everyone
[55:33.480 --> 55:37.920]  in this country, trying to make any of us criminals, trying to intimidate any of us.
[55:37.920 --> 55:42.520]  We've got to not be intimidated, and we've got to see that real change is done.
[55:42.520 --> 55:47.800]  Get rid of the passive people like Jeff Sessions who see something, but they don't do anything
[55:47.800 --> 55:48.800]  about it.
[55:48.800 --> 55:50.120]  Listen to this last quote.
[55:50.120 --> 55:55.000]  This is from James Clapper after he discovered that this went out.
[55:55.000 --> 56:00.720]  He says, there is a robust legal regime in place that governs all activities conducted
[56:00.720 --> 56:03.840]  pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
[56:03.840 --> 56:06.120]  Well, that's just not true.
[56:06.120 --> 56:07.120]  That's just not true.
[56:07.120 --> 56:08.800]  They didn't do it.
[56:08.800 --> 56:12.400]  It is a robust, illegal regime that we have in Washington, and that's what we've got to
[56:12.400 --> 56:13.400]  get rid of.
[56:13.400 --> 56:14.920]  Now, I'm joined here by Jakari Jackson.
[56:14.920 --> 56:15.920]  How are you doing, Jakari?
[56:15.920 --> 56:20.720]  I'm doing well, not so well after hearing that information, but doing okay.
[56:20.720 --> 56:25.040]  We had some breaking news that came in yesterday, just as we were switching over to live coverage
[56:25.040 --> 56:26.760]  in Mildeburg.
[56:26.760 --> 56:30.040]  It was just kind of breaking, and so we didn't have a lot of details about it, and it's still
[56:30.040 --> 56:33.680]  a little bit sketchy as far as the details about it, but tell us what happened with a
[56:33.680 --> 56:34.680]  sheriff in Florida.
[56:34.680 --> 56:38.720]  Well, this is actually something we got off our tip line, showtips, at infoawards.com.
[56:38.720 --> 56:40.640]  So thank you to that viewer.
[56:40.640 --> 56:45.320]  We have this article, Florida Sheriff Arrested After Defending Second Amendment.
[56:45.320 --> 56:47.840]  This is Florida Sheriff Nick Finch.
[56:47.840 --> 56:51.600]  He was booked into his own jail after releasing a man from the jail, and you say, why would
[56:51.600 --> 56:53.080]  he release a man from the jail?
[56:53.080 --> 56:57.320]  The man was arrested for carrying a firearm in his vehicle without a permit, which is
[56:57.320 --> 57:00.480]  a third degree felony in the state of Florida.
[57:00.480 --> 57:03.640]  The sheriff said, hey, I don't want this guy in my jail under these trumped-up charges.
[57:03.640 --> 57:09.120]  He releases the man, or allegedly releases the man, I should say, and now the governor
[57:09.120 --> 57:13.240]  had called for him to be suspended, so he's currently on suspension at the moment.
[57:13.240 --> 57:16.480]  He also has some legal jeopardy himself, doesn't he?
[57:16.480 --> 57:20.840]  They went in, they replaced, they took out the duly elected sheriff who was just elected
[57:20.840 --> 57:22.040]  in November.
[57:22.040 --> 57:28.120]  They removed him, and they've put in someone else, and they have charged him, now he can
[57:28.120 --> 57:30.400]  get charged with, I believe, a third degree felony.
[57:30.400 --> 57:34.280]  Yes, they said, I believe it was evidence tampering, or actually, I think the official
[57:34.280 --> 57:40.600]  charge is one count of official misconduct is the actual charge he's being charged with.
[57:40.600 --> 57:44.480]  And I had a chance, I reached out to Sheriff Mack yesterday, a friend of our show, and
[57:44.480 --> 57:45.480]  I said, Sheriff, do you know anything about this?
[57:45.480 --> 57:46.480]  He's with the constitutional sheriff.
[57:46.480 --> 57:50.280]  The constitutional sheriff, and I had a chance to talk to him, and he says, I know of this
[57:50.280 --> 57:53.880]  guy, I don't know him real well, but I know the guy, and he's not taking phone calls right
[57:53.880 --> 57:56.560]  now for legal reasons and so on and so forth.
[57:56.560 --> 57:58.960]  But I said, Sheriff Mack, what do you think about this situation?
[57:58.960 --> 58:03.000]  He said, regardless if the governor got involved or not, it should have never gotten to the
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.880]  point where the sheriff was suspended from his duties.
[58:05.880 --> 58:06.880]  That's right.
[58:06.880 --> 58:12.840]  And now, as we're seeing the government over and over again, breaking over the barriers
[58:12.840 --> 58:17.320]  that have been set for it, going into jurisdictional areas where they don't have jurisdiction,
[58:17.320 --> 58:21.920]  going in and breaking their own laws, it's not, it's bad enough that they had FISA, but
[58:21.920 --> 58:23.640]  they don't even pay attention to FISA.
[58:23.640 --> 58:29.480]  They're now getting records of domestic American citizens under that FISA Act.
[58:29.480 --> 58:30.960]  We'll be right back after the hour.
[58:30.960 --> 58:34.240]  We're going to have David Ike and Alex Jones coming up at eight after.
[58:34.240 --> 58:42.840]  Stay tuned.
[58:42.840 --> 58:50.640]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.640 --> 58:56.000]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms, but if you don't have a home security system,
[58:56.000 --> 59:00.120]  then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[59:00.120 --> 59:04.040]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[59:04.040 --> 59:05.040]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[59:05.040 --> 59:10.000]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:24.480]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.160]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones radio show.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.160]  I'm David Knight.
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:32.520]  Alex is not live from Austin, Texas, but he is live from London, England, and he is
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:37.520]  joined there in studio for the first time with David Ikes.
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.200]  And we're going to go to that interview right now.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.920]  Alex, can you hear me?
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.320]  Absolutely, David.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:47.880]  We are live here in Watford, a suburb of Northwest London.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:54.640]  And it really is historical that hundreds of international media outlets, German, Italian,
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:00.880]  Russian, French, British, AP from the United States, they are all here covering a group
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:06.000]  that in many Western countries, they said did not exist.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.040]  And so we've got a lot of big breaking news with David Cameron, the prime minister.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:15.760]  Now publicly today on Sky Television, Rupert Murdoch's outfit here in the UK, I'm going
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.760]  to Bilderberg.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:21.000]  So now they've gone from, it doesn't exist to, oh, it's no big deal, it's not powerful,
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.320]  you're a cook to want to know about this secret colluding lobbying group, to now, okay, it's
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.640]  like a G20 meeting, no big deal.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:32.960]  But the point is, this has really discredited the power structure because they're behaving
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.560]  like and acting like they've never criticized people that talk about this.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:42.320]  And this is in the midst of a giant lobbying scandal here in the UK.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:47.040]  And we also got on a barge and actually got onto the grounds and had them all freak out.
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.080]  The police tried to board us with a boat.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.080]  That was all pretty crazy.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:54.560]  And then they made the boat stop and threw us off and I walked back three miles, which
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.560]  is good.
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:56.560]  I need the exercise.
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.840]  But folks, when we come back from break, some stations join us, that's why he's not on
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:00.840]  yet.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:06.280]  Right there, first time ever, David Ike in here, our little makeshift studio.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:09.360]  Coming to you across the world.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:13.720]  And again, the entire planet is starting to wake up to this.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:18.840]  Thanks to people like Jim Tucker, David Ike, myself, George Norrie is one of the first
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:23.720]  big outlets outside of my show in the US, and obviously a much bigger AM and FM presence
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.360]  to break it in the last decade.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.840]  So George Norrie deserves a lot of credit.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:30.720]  And by the way, George Norrie has been contacting us once we come home with an update tonight.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:31.840]  We haven't gotten back with him yet.
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:32.840]  We're just not doing that.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.720]  And I think I'm on John B. Wells Saturday.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:38.400]  But if I haven't responded, I kind of forgot in the last few days that Wells had contacted
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.400]  us.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.920]  If I haven't responded, I want to come on.
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.560]  That's how I communicate with people now is over the radio.
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.600]  And hi to my wife and children, love you out there.
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:50.680]  But when we come back, I'm going to try to get serious and try to go over a lot of questions
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:53.040]  in my mind for David Ike.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:57.480]  Because I've always liked the guy, but now I'm meeting him in person, liking him even
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.480]  more.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:59.680]  He has quite the presence.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.920]  And so does his son, very, very nice fellow who's going to be on with us and also works
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:03.920]  on the website.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:04.920]  DavidIke.com.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:09.080]  So that is coming up after this quick break.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:14.040]  My head is spinning right now at the amount of coverage of this and the fact that people
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:18.120]  are figuring out, wait, the regulators are meeting with the regulated and these are the
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:21.720]  mega bankers that get trillions of our dollars.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:25.840]  And why are the police trying to block protesters from getting into the area when they're having
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.080]  their own future destroyed?
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:32.280]  This is really the incredible hopes that the establishment had with our trust that they
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:36.200]  didn't exist and that the buck stops with the prime minister or the president.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:41.160]  This is the hoax imploding and falling in on itself right now.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.880]  That is what we're seeing happen.
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:48.760]  And now the real debate can start taking place about what is the agenda of these controllers.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.560]  And so David Ike is here with us.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:53.960]  I'll tell you the one thing that really gets through the police I've talked to.
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:04:00.480]  There's only one country that has higher cancer rates and some cancers than the United States.
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:04.400]  And that's the UK and then Russia is right behind us.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.880]  Russia is used to live like 76 years, not 50 something.
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:10.480]  So they actually die quicker than anybody in the West now.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.280]  But when I talk about how they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines, they've been
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:17.120]  caught doing it and sterilence and how it's a Bilderberg program.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.120]  And I tell the cops, I bet you got kids dying of cancer, I bet your wife or son's dying.
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:25.760]  I bet your family dying young and the cops are freaking out going, how do you know that?
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.680]  And I go, look, today, I've been saying this the last four or five days while I've been
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:36.240]  here in advance of this, today, the London independence is in the hotel, half of Britain's
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.560]  alive in 2020 will get cancer.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.280]  But there's never a discussion of why they admit it's exploding in here.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:51.680]  Pediatric cancers in the US on average over 10,000% increase, autism over 10,000% increase
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.640]  from 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 50 something.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:58.880]  So the dehumanization extermination program is taking place.
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:04.320]  We'll be back with David Ike and they see through one all of your filtration in one system
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.920]  portable on the go.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:10.480]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:15.920]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosalicic
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:21.560]  acid advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new

[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:27.560]  filter element.

[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:05.200]  A little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:09.840]  good sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well known fact
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:14.060]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:19.460]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:24.520]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:25.520]  be healthy.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:31.520]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:35.880]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once

[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:06.600]  That's infowarsteam.com From 2013 Bilderberg in London, here is Alex Jones.
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:14.840]  Hi ladies and gentlemen, I don't normally travel a lot, people know that, but I could
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:21.560]  see that we're at a critical juncture in modern history right now with humanity awakening
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:26.080]  to the fact that there are corrupt powers that be, that there are secretive, oppressive
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.240]  agendas going on.
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:30.760]  With me here in studio for the first time ever, it's so great to be able to meet him
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:34.960]  in person, even more impressed now, getting to just meet him just about an hour ago when
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.680]  he graciously came here first to this interview with us when he got for Watford, is David
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:45.120]  Icke, we're going to go to him in just a moment, but directing you to drudzreport.com and infowars.com,
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:51.560]  I just want to say that it is amazing to be able to see how the alternative media has
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:56.980]  been able to become the mainstream media and the facade like Solchescu's Romania falling
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:58.840]  is happening.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:03.520]  I had so much mainstream media here, let's not exaggerate, I probably did 15 international
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:08.880]  TV interviews today, probably 10 yesterday or more, and most of them were not being
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.920]  smartmouth and they were actually, oh yes, now it's come out, the NSA spying, this government
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:17.240]  spying, it's illegal, there's illegal lobbying, so now what do we do?
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.840]  Then the BBC comes over and it's like, ah-ha, none of it's real, there's no one meeting
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:25.440]  here, ah-ha, it was like comic book characters, and I said, this is why you're so hated, you're
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:28.800]  acting like this, but look at these headlines up at drudzreport.com, a lot of them are also
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:32.760]  infowars.com, but drudzreport.com has that way of laying them out here.
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.000]  And I'm seeing people finally get it.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.560]  The internet from hell, NSA, FBI secretly mining data from internet firms, they quite
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:48.560]  literally can watch your ideas as you type, that's a quote, mainstream news, what did
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:52.480]  I tell you 18 years ago, because it was all in the telecommunications act and it's all
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:57.600]  standardized worldwide by the globalists, it's a centralized corporate tyranny, a top secret
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:05.400]  prism program, a prism, visit data trove, vast data trove, billions of phone calls
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:12.900]  recorded daily, paper, Obama agenda, lost in firestorm, New York Times says Obama cannot
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:18.360]  lead anymore, I saw that yesterday, Obama comes out and says, nobody is listening to
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:23.840]  your telephone calls, they're listening on record, but he tells this, it's okay, it
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:28.800]  goes on here, portray us at Bilderberg to craft big data spy grid, that's on their
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:32.680]  own agenda, but I have sources inside Bilderberg, I'm going to tell you what they've told me
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:36.040]  after David Ike leaves us, but I'll share some of it with him, but I want to hear from
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:39.760]  him, I'm going to get to him in a moment, I know a lot of stations just joined us.
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:45.520]  We've got UK prime minister going from the media saying it doesn't exist to, oh big deal,
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:51.880]  to now the prime minister showing up in almost as much security as you'd see at a G20 or
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:52.880]  something.
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.520]  This is crazy.
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:59.120]  And the fact that they have denied all of this is blowing up in their face and their
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:04.240]  intimidation of reporters saying we'll arrest you if you expose any of our spying, any of
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:11.480]  our persecution, we'll arrest you, I'm seeing a revolt by their own minions who were compartmentalized
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.160]  because of the intimidation.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:19.160]  I think they thought we were intimidated, the general public, instead of just lazy, and
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:23.680]  I think it's backfiring on them, so that some of what's coming up today will also give
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:28.480]  you the headlines that are on infowars.com.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:32.680]  But joining us here in studio for the rest of this hour and 20 minutes into the next
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:39.960]  hour is David Ike, and you would have thought that the King of England had arrived to visit
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:40.960]  with the people.
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.680]  In fact, they were a lot more excited than that when David showed up, I've got to be
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:44.680]  honest.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:45.680]  When I showed up, I was mobbed.
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:49.200]  I think they have a word for it in rugby, what do they call it?
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.200]  A scrum.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.200]  A scrum.
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:59.800]  Well, when David arrived, it was a super scrum, and I tell you, man, it is great to be here
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:05.400]  with you, it is great to meet you in person, and thank you for spending time with us.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.720]  What is going on in the world?
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.440]  Nice to meet you after all this time in a hotel room in Watford, who'd have thought
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:11.440]  it.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:12.440]  Absolutely.
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.400]  What's going on in the world, Alex?
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:23.400]  I think we're at a very special time, because when I started out more than 20 years ago,
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.400]  it was a lonely road.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:29.800]  I mean, anyone who's been in this road a long time knows that there weren't many interested
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:30.800]  people that long ago.
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:31.800]  Do you want me to move around?
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:35.960]  Excuse me just a little bit, yeah, I'll catch you later.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:45.760]  And now, suddenly, this cusp moment where we're getting towards a critical mass of people
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.880]  where the waters are starting to break, and I think two things are happening.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:59.720]  First of all, the endless toil and effort, apparently against all the odds, banging your
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:05.320]  head against a wall, year after year, decade after decade, eventually we've seen a point
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:09.440]  now where the wall is starting to show cracks in it.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:15.040]  We're starting to get this information out to enough people so that they can see that
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:17.680]  the world is very much different to what they thought it was.
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:25.440]  But there's something else happening, which I think is just as important in a way and
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.560]  interacts with that.
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:34.800]  That is that this agenda has now reached the point where it's not in the shadows anymore
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:40.960]  in terms of the way it's playing out, it's still in the shadows, in the deep inner sanctum
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:47.480]  that's orchestrating it, but in the way it's playing out, in the banking crash, in austerity,
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:52.320]  where there's been this fantastic transfer of wealth from the people through governments
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:59.000]  to banks and the elite, and after Cyprus now they've started to actually take the government
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.240]  out of that equation and go straight into people's bank accounts, all these things are
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:08.760]  coming together to get people to look at the world in a different way.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.720]  People are seeing the world and they're thinking, what's happening?
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:17.800]  I don't like what's going on, this is happening, that's happening, what's going on?
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:25.040]  Fortunately, after all these years of effort, there is now a massive alternative media that
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:30.160]  actually has the ability, which is what's going on, to say to people in that state,
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.680]  this is why it's happening.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:38.440]  And it's making sense to people, it's making sense of the world to people that the normal
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:45.000]  mainstream explanations of everything are not making, and this combination of people's
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:51.840]  life experience and the information explaining the world in a different way, this is coming
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:15:01.200]  together in a way that is really starting to break the waters, and this weekend is
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:04.840]  so symbolic for me.
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:09.880]  We've all been chasing and trying to expose the Bilderberg group for a very long time,
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:16.720]  decades, when people said it didn't exist and it didn't matter even if it did.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:21.640]  And the mainstream media didn't touch it, they never saw it mentioned, these people
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:25.720]  were meeting in different parts of the world and the mainstream media wasn't mentioning
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:26.720]  it.
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:35.880]  And now in Britain, in 2013, we have seen the biggest mainstream exposure of Bilderberg
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:43.240]  in history, and we're not finished yet, there's two days to go, and the genie is out of the
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:51.960]  bottle and it ain't going back because once you start to realize, and it's new to you,
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:57.800]  but actually these people who are making decisions about where the direction of everybody's
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:03.080]  lives on the planet are going, and they're meeting in secret with the corporations and
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:12.440]  the banks and the inner sanctum of the elite in a hotel in secret, are we not allowed to
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:17.160]  know officially what they're discussing and all the rest of it, this has been a bloody
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:23.320]  revelation to people who are new to this and it's happened because this has got into the
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:27.200]  mainstream for the first time, it's a great discovery, it's the discovery of the shadow
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.200]  government.
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:35.880]  Yeah, what we've been talking about all these years, that actually if you go high enough,
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:40.560]  there's only one oil company, there's only one biotech company, there's only one big
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:45.840]  farmer company, in the end there's only one political party in terms of major political
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:53.400]  parties in every country, that's kind of been, oh yeah, well yeah, that's over the top, that's
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:17:01.680]  exaggeration, but here we have in Watford on the outskirts of London, the proof of that
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:08.480]  in the sense of these different elements which in any so-called democratic society should
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:13.640]  be kept apart from everybody and if there are discussions going on and what have you,
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:18.760]  they should be in public, now it's in the open and in the mainstream media, not the
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:23.320]  big picture of why it's happening but the fact that it is happening and this is opening
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:31.680]  so many people's eyes to the fact that this hidden hand is not a myth, it's the truth,
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:37.000]  it's a great weekend, it's a pivotal weekend and it's a weekend we'll look back at and
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.800]  say yeah, you can put your finger on that, that was the time that the change and the
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:44.080]  transformation became obvious.
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:50.680]  Again, David Eich is our guest in studio here in our hotel room, our makeshift studio in
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:54.320]  Watford, England and I've got a bunch of questions for David, we're going to break here in a
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:18:01.000]  few minutes, we can get started with these now but I wanted you to repeat what you said
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:06.320]  when you first got there and gave kind of an impromptu speech, whenever I made the point
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:12.320]  that they want us poor, I mean they write documents, they say that but still the general public
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:17.880]  I don't think gets why they want us poor so David we've got about two minutes to describe
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:20.200]  why they want us poor.
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:28.040]  Well if anyone's seen the movie The Hunger Games where you had a tiny elite in what they
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:36.200]  call the capital in high tech mega luxury and the rest of the population in the country
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:42.400]  was in mega poverty, what they want, people talk all the time and so they should about
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:46.680]  the attack on the middle class in America, when this attack on what we call the middle
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:54.080]  class is slightly different meaning in this country too and the reason that that's being
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:19:05.160]  targeted is because if you have a middle class as was, you have a graph which goes from poor
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:10.680]  up to rich, if you look at the graph now I saw one the other day, skip this network break
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:17.800]  we're skipping the break, I saw one the other day on an official mainstream website in America
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:26.480]  and it went like this, poor, middle class, hardly much movement and then straight up
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:35.320]  and the straight up was 1% and it was so big that they had to put the top of that pyramid
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:42.080]  next to it to get it on the page and we're already getting there and so this is the society
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:48.240]  they want and for me when you're researching something, knowing what the end is and knowing
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:54.280]  the means of manipulation to get there are absolutely crucial to understanding the game
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:20:00.520]  and what they want is a mega mega rich, I mean it's become known as the 1%, it's probably
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:07.480]  much less than that if you get the mega mega rich, right up there, right mountain high
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:15.360]  and then a mega poor population that's basically in the same boat and this is why I say to
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:22.240]  people and just very quickly, this is why the Cyprus thing was set as a precedent to
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:26.920]  go directly, not through governments, to go directly into the bank accounts of people
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:30.400]  Now you walk through the bailouts, explain how they do it, first it's too big to fail,
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:35.480]  they sign you on to that, then explain it, well what they did in 2008 was they crashed
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:41.440]  the economic system on purpose, problem reaction solution, they then started this incredible
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:49.080]  transfer of wealth for the reasons I'm just talking about, from the people to the banks
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:56.080]  and the elite via governments, what they did in doing that was transfer the problem from
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:03.280]  a banking crisis into a government debt crisis, this was then passed on from the governments
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:10.960]  to the people, it became now a people crisis on the basis of the austerity programs all
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:15.000]  over the world, well we bailed out the banks so we haven't got the money for all these
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:22.600]  services so austerity, so there's a massive transfer of wealth from the people to the
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:30.520]  elite with the people suffering and no one else, then you moved to Cyprus to the next
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:36.360]  stage of this, when instead of stealing the wealth of the people via governments to the
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:43.480]  elite and the banking system, they went direct into the bank accounts of the people, a lot
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:50.160]  of them who were very rich in Cyprus bank accounts, who are a lot less rich now, direct
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:56.720]  to their accounts, and what this is doing is setting the precedent to do it all over
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:02.560]  the world because when there's another banking crisis and there's so many planned for this
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:09.240]  very reason, this was a little bit of a beta test, what it was Alex, especially in Europe
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:16.160]  and in the European Union, it was setting the precedent, precedent is a powerful thing
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:23.680]  to set because when the next banking crisis comes and there's a problem and they've got
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:28.800]  to bail out the bank or the rest of it, they're now going to say well hold on a second governments
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:35.280]  are going to say this and the European Union is going to say this, we can't justify bailing
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:41.760]  out the banks, what about the people in Cyprus, we can't just let people go straight to their
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:47.960]  bank accounts and not do it here and that's the idea and so I say this to people around
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:53.120]  the world who at the moment think they're well off and at the moment think that this
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:56.920]  does not affect them and it's not your problem.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:03.080]  If you are not a member of this elite of the elite, if you are not a member of this upper
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:12.680]  echelon of this 1%, then they want your money too and they're coming for it and this precedent
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:16.280]  set in Cyprus is a massive step towards that.
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:20.760]  They want you as poor as the people you think well they're poor, they're not my problem.
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:26.360]  The idea is to make it your problem and therefore we have to come together and put down the
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:32.320]  fault lines of income bracket and so-called class, we're in this together because they
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:36.800]  want us all mega-poor, not just the currently mega-poor.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:43.200]  That's right, it is a total tool of political control and they write books about it, whether
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:47.160]  it's Henry Kissinger and his memorandum 200 or whether it's the science czar John B.
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:53.400]  Aldrin or June 21, they say they want a post-industrial world where they're in these government and
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:57.560]  corporate and university reservations, they're above the law, they get the life extension
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:01.960]  technology, they get it all and that's only the next phase.
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:06.000]  In fact, where did that newspaper go that I had?
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.720]  Here it is, right here David, this is what I want to talk to you about next, then we'll
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:12.240]  get back into Bilderberg, we'll get back into is this really the beginning of the fall of
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:13.240]  Bilderberg?
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:18.120]  I also see a key line, we may be passing where, okay, we have the awakening but if people
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:24.080]  don't do something, then it just kind of sets a precedent that, okay, we accept that.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:29.080]  So I wanted to discuss that with you, I've got a bunch of points I want to go over but
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:35.960]  the London Independent and you look at the cover of it today, half of Britons alive
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:40.680]  in 2020 will get cancer and they're now staying the next few years, half of Americans will
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:46.080]  have diabetes and in the rats and all the studies and all, we know what the vaccines,
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:50.120]  we know what the GMO, we know what the sodium fluoride, we know what it's doing and the
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:58.520]  globalists write books from Bertrand Russell to John P. Holdren currently.
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:05.400]  They get caught all over the world giving little kids SV40 cancer virus, they know what
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:11.080]  they're doing and they're just getting us all used to everybody's got cancer, everybody's
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:16.760]  got Parkinson's early, everybody's got neurological disorders, everybody's got diseases, everybody's
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:22.480]  got problems and then don't worry, we've got treatments for the disease you've now got
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:28.320]  and never mind that breast cancer's up 3,000% or children's cancer's up over 10,000% or
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:34.640]  then again, America and England lead the world because we're run by these eugenicists, Hitler
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:39.440]  was their man, he just went a little bit early and only had for specific groups, they're
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:46.040]  going after the whole world in a scientific program and it just hits me that of course
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:49.400]  I'm not worried about them killing me or I'm not worried about being shut down, I'm not
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:54.080]  worried about being sued or any of this because I've read their own words, I know how diabolical
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.080]  it is, I know I'm living in the equivalent of a science fiction nightmare, they want
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:02.640]  the whole world and our numbers reduced by at least 80%, they're on record, they're on
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:07.600]  record doing secret experiments against us all over the world, we know the people running
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:12.240]  our countries are the most wicked people on the earth, we know they're funding Al Qaeda
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:17.000]  and using them on innocent countries like Libya and Syria, we know they're spying on
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.960]  us without warrants, we now know they're criminal, what we've all said unfortunately is all
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:27.160]  being confirmed and it's bizarre now to have people really listening to us because now
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:33.160]  there's that much more of a responsibility but what about the fact that this attack is
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:37.840]  so over the top David, I that that's what they almost have over on us is that it's
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:43.920]  so diabolical, so crazy, so evil that yeah people can finally get their spying on you
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:47.720]  without warrants, they can finally get that they're taking poor people's tax money and
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:51.800]  giving it to offshore billionaires that control trillions who want their money to be worth
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:55.960]  more by bankrupting you so they can buy it for pennies on the dollar, they're replacing
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:27:01.520]  humans with robots at Foxcom factories and saying good go jump off the roof, I mean we
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:07.760]  are already in the middle of just insane times, how much more crazy will it get and how does
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:12.640]  this cancer situation tie into it all, will people sit there and watch their families
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:17.280]  die David and I and not care about the globalist doing it to them?
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:25.760]  I've said for so many years one of the greatest ways of suppressing a population is to suppress
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:33.600]  their sense of the possible, if you could suppress their sense of what is possible by hiding
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:38.040]  technology by hiding the agenda by hiding the cause of all these things you're talking
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:46.720]  about then people will sit there like like like a frog sitting in a boiling water and
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:52.240]  they will get boiled because they can't see the possibility that actually they might get
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:59.000]  boiled or even that they're in the process of being so and so the biggest and this is
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:07.960]  the mainstream media, the mainstream media's range of what is possible is so minute and
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:12.320]  this then is transferred by people getting most of their information through the mainstream
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:20.040]  media to the population, what is so brilliant about this Bilderberg weekend as it's turned
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:29.600]  out is Bilderberg is a, it's a part of the web and it's part of the agenda that people
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:36.880]  can use to enter the web in terms of understanding it because it's at a level that they can deal
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:43.600]  with, it's politicians, corporations, chiefs and what have you, illegal lobbying, meeting
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:52.040]  together in secret and it's like what's going on but the Bilderberg group is merely a strand
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:59.960]  in the web and it's well out from the center, the spider and if you go back from the Bilderberg
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:07.160]  group towards the spider the closer you get the more evil, the more satanic, the more
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:13.880]  secretive and exclusive these strands in the web become, you go that way from the Bilderberg
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:19.600]  group into mainstream society and you're going into governments and departments and corporations
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:21.720]  where the same agreed agenda plays out.
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:24.600]  We're going to go Greg, absolutely extremely powerful with David, I want to come back and
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:29.480]  talk about what is at the core of the spider and how you said that Cervelle at the BBC
[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:34.440]  was basically a pedophile years ago, you laid all this out and I would hear this 17 years
[01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:38.720]  ago and I'd go he says a lot of good stuff but I can't buy this and then it all just
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:42.200]  keeps coming true, coming true, coming true, how did you know all this, I guess you worked
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:45.520]  there, we're going to talk to David Ike and more straight ahead and he'll be with you
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:49.800]  in the next hour for some, take your phone calls, annual meet his son, stay with us.

[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:22.000]  Here is Alex Jones in London, live, Bilderberg 2013, the globalists have arrived.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:27.160]  Everything that we promote, everything I sell, everything I do to fund our operation is something
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:33.040]  that I personally use, something I believe in and meeting the men, women and children
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:36.720]  from all over the UK and Europe that have come here, I've probably shook a thousand
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:40.960]  hands because most people just come through for a few hours and leave and they were already
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:44.520]  there on Wednesday, they were there on Thursday, they were there today, we're expecting thousands
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:45.520]  tomorrow.
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:48.560]  I talk to the police, they've been kind of clicking, you know, the people that come
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:52.320]  through and they estimate there's been about 2,000 people through so far.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:57.480]  I see them, it really humbles me to know that they're so awake and that it's been their
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:02.440]  support and your support out there that is made when infowars.com has done possible.
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:06.120]  And I'm not that, you know, smart of a guy, I'm not that great of a guy and I've had
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:11.600]  incredible success because I have studied history and knew that these globalists were
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:14.280]  evil and that we had a job to do exposing them.
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:18.880]  We're going to go back to David, I can a moment continue on this very important discussion
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:22.440]  we're having and give you the latest on Bilderberg and a bunch of other world news that's taking
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:23.940]  place.

[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:33.800]  And so I promote things that I believe in that I use, films, books, non-GMO, high quality
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:40.040]  seeds at the seed center at infowars, store.com, that's what funds our operation.
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:46.040]  And we're doing a special until the 9th when Bilderberg officially ends on Sunday where

[01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:59.440]  And it's the first thing you can do.
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:03.040]  The globalists treat you like animals, they're on record spike in the water with radioactive
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.720]  isotopes, hydrofluorosalic acid, all of it.
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:11.240]  They're trying to block states passing laws to take it out of the water in the US.
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:13.480]  Same things going on in Europe and the UK.
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:16.160]  So go to infowarsstore.com.

[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:42.320]  And even if you already have a water filter or can't afford one, it doesn't matter.

[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:57.040]  We need more people getting more out with more eyes to organically try to resist this
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:02.440]  technocracy that we are facing, there's a lot of other sponsors like eFoodsDirect.com,
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:07.320]  Forge slash Alex for the specials that are also making this trip possible.
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:12.520]  InfidelBodyArmor.com is also making this trip possible.
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:17.960]  So again, whatever you do, infowarsstore.com, that's what's making it all possible.
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:20.240]  And again, your prayers as well and support.
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:28.320]  Okay, so we went to break when I was talking to David about this anti-human agenda.
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:34.560]  And why are every major institution in the world, whether it's Russia or China or England
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:42.840]  or the US, Catholic Church or the BBC or why is it pedophiles and necrophiliacs and devil
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:43.840]  worshipers.
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:44.920]  I mean, I never get sick of my wife.
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:47.000]  I never get sick of a glass of red wine.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.600]  I never get sick of enchiladas.
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:51.040]  I never get sick of a sunrise or sunset.
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:57.160]  I never get tired of just green grass, good stuff, paddling in a kayak down the river.
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:01.520]  I do not get how they're so into this, but that's why they win.
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:06.240]  What you were talking about is that they've shrunk the possible.
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:07.240]  So we're so naive.
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:09.240]  David, I, you can say what you want about it.
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:12.320]  That's when I realized about 15 years ago, this guy is nothing but positive.
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:17.920]  He expands your window and forces you with things that sound so radical, whether he's
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:19.680]  completely right or not, none of us are perfect.
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:22.360]  We see through rose color glasses.
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:28.520]  David, I forces you to expand the window of perception of the possible because I would
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:34.080]  hear him talk about the BBC is full of pedophiles and they have sex with dead bodies and they
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:38.640]  drink blood and Al Gore drinks blood and then I actually found the article where he falls
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:41.200]  around with bags of blood in case he's injured.
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:42.760]  And then I found out more about them.
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:44.920]  These people are just given over.
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:46.760]  They are psychopaths with air forces.
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:50.760]  They are, they are devil worshipers with nuclear weapons and look at history.
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:55.240]  We know all the ancient emperors in Rome and the Aztecs were all crazy nuts.
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:58.280]  So of course, these are 21st century versions of that.
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:02.960]  So get into that and the cancer rates exploding and what they're doing and what their master
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.400]  plan is and then more in Bilderberg.
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:11.920]  What this means that we force it out in the open and that crossroads are at David, I well,
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:13.400]  all these things come together in the end.
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:18.760]  I mean, the more you research and the more you understand, the more every dot connects.
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:28.600]  And what I was saying a few minutes ago about the greatest or one of the greatest defenses
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:35.560]  that this conspiracy has is suppressing the sense of the possible and the media are constantly
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:37.480]  doing that.
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:39.720]  And yes, this is a great weekend.
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:40.720]  Fantastic.
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:46.680]  I hope as many people come here, you can get here tomorrow as possible.
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:53.840]  And it's a way of entering the web in a way that people can understand and appreciate
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:59.560]  within their view of the world, within the blinkers that we're, you know, manipulated
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:01.880]  to wear all our lives.
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:09.240]  But I say this to you, this is a way of entering the web and it's a very significant strand
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:16.120]  in the web, but to understand the Bilderberg groups part in all this and to understand
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:24.960]  the web itself, all preconceived idea since the day you were born, all belief systems,
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:34.520]  all senses of the impossible just have to be allowed to fall and let information be
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:41.960]  your guide, not preconceived idea, belief, which senses where you will go and what you
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:49.760]  will consider to be possible, because the Bilderberg group is a strand within a satanic
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:40:00.080]  conspiracy that is so deep, so evil, so completely beyond what we would perceive as any form
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:08.280]  of humanity or heart or compassion or any other empathy that we really do have to open
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:12.320]  our minds to let in the truth of what we're facing.
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:17.280]  And that's not to be frightened, that's not to be scared of it.
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:27.160]  This evil only prospers because it has put us in a tiny box of perception, understanding
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:32.520]  and ignorance of the world we live in and the reality we're experiencing.
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:36.560]  If it was all powerful, it would not have to do that.
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:42.600]  And if we open our minds, open our hearts and let our minds expand where they want to
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:50.280]  go rather than holding them in a position that we're programmed to hold them, then together
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:56.760]  this is a house of cars that we're looking at, this all powerful evil, no, it's a house
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:04.120]  of cars and it's absolutely dependent for its survival on humanity, on mass, staying
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:05.360]  asleep.
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:10.160]  So it's not something to fear, it is something to face.
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:15.200]  And so anyone that's coming in now and seeing this Bilderberg, oh my goodness, what they
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:21.160]  meet in secret, oh, I didn't know that was going on, well, strap in because that's the
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:24.400]  start of the journey through the web.
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:31.920]  Because what Alex was talking about is what is actually unfolding in front of our eyes.
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:39.560]  There is a mass operation not coming, not somewhere over the rainbow, sometime never,
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:47.600]  that is happening in our lives now, which is to create a massive, massive cull of the
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.240]  population.
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:55.640]  And this is not something where large numbers of people suddenly just keel over because
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:58.040]  people are going, hey, what's happening?
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:07.480]  This is a cumulative destroying of the human immune system and a war on the human body
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:09.400]  and the human mind.
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:17.040]  And it's being done because of the web, the spider, the center of the web, therefore controls
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:23.320]  the policy of corporations, biotech corporations like Lonsanto that are producing the GM foods
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:26.520]  which are genetically modifying us.
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:33.160]  The same spider is controlling the pharmaceutical industry, which is destroying the immune system
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:39.160]  and a war with the body through pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines.
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:50.080]  And the same spider is controlling the network of mega parasites that we call the banking
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:51.240]  system.
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:57.600]  That same spider is dictating through the web to governments to introduce the agenda
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.240]  that the spider is dictating.
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:04.640]  This is a major part of what Bilderberg does in this interface between the hidden and the
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:06.280]  world that we see.
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:11.920]  So it's time not just to recognize what the Bilderberg group is, but what a great moment
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:14.320]  that people are now seeing it in such numbers.
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:22.600]  But to make that the first step because this spider's web, this rabbit hole, whatever analogy
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:28.000]  you want is so deep and we need to face it so we can sort it out.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:34.120]  And therefore, all impossibles must be off if we're going to understand what's really
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:35.120]  happening.
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:36.120]  Absolutely.
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:39.760]  I meant to do this today and I forgot to tell the crew if they can search engine, this
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:42.840]  Charlie Skelton article that was linked up on infoworks.com.
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:50.000]  But if they just search Bilderberg 2013, friendly policemen, a press zone, and the one show.
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:54.080]  If they'll just search one of Charlie Skelton's or just go to Charlie Skelton's articles
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:44:00.920]  on The Guardian and go to Bilderberg 2013, friendly policemen, a press zone, and the
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:01.920]  one show.
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:05.680]  And myself and Leigh Ann McAdoo were over there taking photos while the crew was doing
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:11.280]  video interviews as the globalist drove in yesterday when we both missed the shot.
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:16.680]  But I saw it with my eye and I missed that and then I looked over and another came by
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:19.480]  because it's hard when they're driving by fast to catch it, but one spot you can get
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:20.480]  a shot.
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:24.280]  They were all driving by because I saw this three times and thank God somebody caught
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:25.280]  it.
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:26.800]  They caught it on multiple cars.
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:30.680]  They would drive by with daily males because the first time I saw it, I said, that's just
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:32.240]  got to be a coincidence.
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:34.280]  A second time, a third time.
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:40.280]  Now maybe the Mercedes cab company said here, cover your face with this, but it's the image
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:42.040]  of them covering their faces.
[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:47.240]  They don't have 10 in windows with a tabloid magazine, a newspaper.
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:51.840]  They would drive by with newspapers up with their faces and there's a photo of this.
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:57.680]  Again, Bilderberg 2013, friendly policemen, just search engine, that folks, click news
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:58.680]  and you'll get it.
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:00.880]  Bilderberg 2013, friendly policemen.
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:04.160]  Did the office, were you guys able to find that yet?
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:07.600]  Okay, they're showing it right now on screen, David.
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:08.600]  Look at this.
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:12.120]  Now, because again, I wasn't up there even much of the time.
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:17.960]  A bunch of them came in at once, so I was sitting there and I saw it once, I said, did
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:18.960]  we get that?
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:19.960]  No, no, it's blurred.
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:20.960]  Oh, this is the guy I got it.
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:21.960]  Okay.
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:22.960]  Did we get that?
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:23.960]  Yeah.
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:24.960]  Finally, they went three times.
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:31.000]  The others went by with the Daily Mail tabloid up, with the words, child porn teacher allowed
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.720]  back in classroom.
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:39.840]  Why would they drive by with a tabloid saying child porn when you've been exposing Savelle
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:41.880]  and the Royal Family and all this?
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:44.200]  What is really going on here, David Eich?
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:48.640]  Well, it's funny because I noticed that this morning just before I left home to come up
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:51.600]  here, I saw one of those pictures and I thought, well, what an appropriate body headline to
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.600]  cover your face with.
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:54.600]  You know, we chatted about this.
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:55.600]  There's a lot of ironing.
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:56.600]  Yeah.
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:00.440]  We've chatted about this in America when you've been in America.
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:04.400]  One of the things that we, can you hear me all right?
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:13.640]  One of the things that I'm talking about when I say we have to expand our sense of the possible
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:21.440]  is that this web in the end is being orchestrated from beyond human sight by a force that is
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:23.560]  anything but human.
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:31.040]  And the rituals, the satanic rituals to the gods that these people are so into and constantly
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:33.840]  into.
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:40.480]  The gods are these entities that are operating outside human sight, which are orchestrating
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:41.480]  this agenda.
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:42.480]  Now, I know people have-
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:45.400]  Why drive through covering your face saying child porn?
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:51.000]  Well, I mean, in many ways, it's just literally putting, he's putting it over his face, but
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.520]  he's putting it in ours, isn't he?
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:47:01.120]  But the thing is that the reason they're so into Satanism and so into pedophilia is because
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:05.520]  these entities feed off human energies.
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:07.880]  Satanists kill because they believe they're getting power.
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:09.480]  They're feeding off human energy.
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:10.480]  They're feeding off fear.
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:16.240]  This is why they've created a structure in human society that is a global factory of
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:18.440]  fear and anxiety.
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:19.440]  And death.
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:20.440]  Yeah, death.
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:21.440]  They feed off death.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:22.440]  That's part of it.
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:23.440]  That's part of it.
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:25.520]  They feed off torture and bomb for peace.
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:28.560]  And this is the point about pedophilia.
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:32.640]  I've been researching this a very, very long time because I've just gone where the music
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:36.240]  took me or the information and not let preconceived idea block me.
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:41.080]  And I don't care what people think about me, so it's not made me keep my mouth shut through
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:42.080]  fear of being ridiculed.
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:44.320]  I'm not quite used to that fully enough.
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:50.000]  But I've been researching this a long time in multiple countries.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:57.440]  And I'll tell you this, the energy that these entities want more than anything else is a
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:04.400]  child's energy before puberty when changes happen, which take it beyond perfection for
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:05.400]  them.
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:06.400]  It's a nectar to them.
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:12.040]  And so what's happening when the pedophile is having sex with the child, the pedophile
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:17.200]  is the conduit by the possessing entity, because all these people are body possessed
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.200]  by these entities.
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:19.200]  So it's vampires.
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:24.240]  And this is why the whole stories of vampires, this is why the British royal family like
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:26.680]  Charles go back to Vlad the Impaler.
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:33.560]  Their intergenerational bloodline vampires, they feed off, people think of drinking blood
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:34.560]  and that's true.
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:35.560]  But it's energy.
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:39.320]  By the way, I heard you like 15 years ago talk about that, that's pure bull and now it's
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:43.280]  all over the news that he lives in Transylvania and is basically a dracool.
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:44.280]  Yeah.
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:48.440]  But people think of vampires, they feed off blood.
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:49.440]  But yes, true.
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.440]  That is true.
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:56.560]  But the major thing they feed on and often blood is just an expression of that is energy.
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:59.440]  And so they're looking for the energy of children.
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:06.320]  And this is why you find this dramatic ratio of pedophiles and Satanists in the so-called
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:12.160]  upper echelon of society compared with the general population, because these particular
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:18.800]  bloodlines are systematically possessed through the rituals, this is how it's done, to become
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:23.920]  conduits in this reality for that, which is controlling them from another reality.
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:30.560]  So while all these people are having their sex with children, they are conduits for feeding
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:32.360]  these entities that energy.
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:34.080]  That's why pedophilia is everywhere.
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:40.880]  And what Jimmy Savile was doing, Alex, people in this country, the stories are broken, Savile
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:43.360]  was a record-breaking pedophile.
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:50.760]  And what they've done, the media, sometimes through pressure and fear of the consequences,
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:56.120]  but actually the authorities and the police have done is hold that position.
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:01.800]  Savile was a record-breaking pedophile.
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:06.480]  The dyke they don't want to break and they're desperately holding on to is that's part of
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:08.080]  the story, but only part.
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:11.120]  He was Renfield, he was supplying them.
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:17.080]  He was supplying politicians like Ted Heath, a man I exposed as a Satanist and child killer
[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:24.400]  seven years before he died in a book, the passage was read days after it was published
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:30.200]  in 1997, 1998, and he had seven years to do something about it and he never did anything
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:31.200]  about it, why?
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.720]  Because it was true.
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:38.040]  Savile was also brought into the inner sanctum of the British royal family.
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:40.120]  And they don't just rape kids, they slit their throats.
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:42.880]  Oh, they do all, that was the speciality of Heath, yeah.
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:45.240]  Stay there, we're going to go to break right now, folks.
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:49.840]  All I can tell you is, all I can tell you is from my study, they're all into this, whether
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:52.840]  it's demons or whatever that are running, I'm doing it.
[01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:58.440]  Christians say it's demons, he says it's something else, and all the same thing, we're going to
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:00.880]  come right back from break with Bilderberg worldwide.
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:04.560]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:08.920]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:10.920]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:16.520]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:18.560]  priced and fully legal.
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:26.640]  But for how long, go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L, body armor dot com.
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:30.360]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:34.560]  Be the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:38.800]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:39.800]  to serve as debt.
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:43.320]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:46.600]  currency, is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.

[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.800]  We're going to go 30 minutes into the next hour and David Eich is going to be here with
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:19.800]  us.
[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:23.840]  We're going to have a son who works on the side, is really an informed person as well
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:29.040]  joining us here on the broadcast and I just want to be clear about this.
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:36.040]  I've had the biggest shows on BBC Sky Television you name it call us and they want us to come
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:42.440]  into town and be on their shows and we may do that but the point is that they would kill
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:46.840]  before not to admit Bilderberg even existed and of course we're like here it exists, here's
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:51.440]  their minutes, here's declassified documents, the CIA helped set it up.
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:56.520]  It was a Hitler plan to put the whole of Europe under an economic dictatorship, the EU, here's
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:55:00.760]  the name of it, I talked to the member of the EU parliament, we heard that the first
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:03.120]  hour who exposed it.
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:07.000]  That's what's so frustrating is that I know the fellow reserve is private, I've read
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.880]  their charter, you can read it right now, it's public, you go to the library and Congress
[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:12.560]  and read it, not just online.
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:16.720]  I know the Bilderberg group was founded in 1954 but was actually around before that.
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:20.000]  I've had National Archive documents leaked to me, WikiLeaks has got them but a lot of
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:25.800]  it's public and the media sits there going you believe it exists, BBC still tried that,
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:30.280]  the other media knew the jig was up but they know they're lying to their viewers, it's
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:35.160]  about hearing well it doesn't exist but I know it exists to make you feel small, it's
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:40.360]  about keeping that idea small so whether it's demons, whatever it is, I can't prove
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:46.320]  any of that, I know that you don't get into these upper echelons of the elite unless you
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:51.560]  are into devil worship hurting children and I know every culture ends up being run by
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:56.840]  an elite that does that when no one I know acts like that or believes like that so regardless
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:56:04.760]  of what runs, regardless it's going on and David how did you discover all of this because
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:09.080]  you said you went to, I think it was Peru by some standing stones and had a vision and
[01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:12.720]  you know I don't get into new age type stuff, I don't even believe in all that, I went to
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:17.800]  Stonehenge and walked across a line, they know this is boring and instantly felt energized
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:18.960]  is that what we're talking about?
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:24.760]  Yeah, I mean I've talked to you on the show before about the fact that you know this reality
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:31.440]  is a projection from an energetic information blueprint, a bit like wireless internet.
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:34.760]  And you believe that scientists have found now that it's a pure program that that's the
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:35.760]  hack.
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:42.320]  Yeah, that's the hack but the thing is that the energy that you felt, let's see the earth
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:49.120]  that has an energy field, we all know that, everyone accepts that, but it is interpenetrated
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:54.880]  with a network of lines they're known in Britain as lay lines or meridian lines, these are
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:56.400]  lines of force.
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:03.440]  Now where many of these lines cross, think of it as a web, it literally is a web of
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:07.120]  energy, electromagnetic energy, so where lots of them cross.
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:08.120]  That's how birds navigate.
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:12.960]  Yeah, well yes, these are the electromagnetic fields.
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:16.320]  By the way, it's now been proven that we all have these cells in our brain.
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:20.800]  Yeah, these are the electromagnetic fields that they use to navigate and so many other
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:25.120]  things happen that are called paranormal, the scientists, you know like Stonehenge
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:28.480]  is a good one, Stonehenge is where the scientists ought to be, that's where their minds are
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:32.040]  in terms of understanding realities it really is.
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:37.440]  But the scientists kind of dismiss that, so they're going, this is a mystery, but when
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:43.200]  you understand you've got this unifying field which unifies everything, suddenly the paranormal
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:49.520]  becomes perfectly bodilogical, but where lots of these lines cross, a massive vortex of
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:55.920]  energy is created and if you do things in that vortex, you affect the Earth's energy
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:58.120]  field in a much more powerful way.
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:02.800]  By the way, I thought it was a joke, had forgotten it was on the phone and walked across a line
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:05.120]  and they kept going back and my whole crew felt it.
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:06.120]  Yeah, I mean I was doing this.
[01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:07.120]  Have you been there?
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:08.120]  No, loads of times.
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:12.560]  I've been doing, you know, this is something I researched a great length years ago and
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:18.480]  it's not new age, some people who do it, you call themselves new age, what it is is simply
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:23.240]  understanding reality on a level that mainstream science does not understand and does not want
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:28.240]  to understand why because it's controlled by the same network and the last thing that
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:32.960]  network wants the target population to do is understand the nature of the reality it's
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:33.960]  experiencing.
[01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:36.960]  That's right, going to break back in 60 seconds and by the way I did look it up.
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:41.160]  I guess what the grove's on, the very same lay line.

[02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:33.320]  to him for like 15 years on air, but David Ike is here in studio in Watford, England.
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:35.400]  People say Watford is some working class area.
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:41.800]  The Grove is incredibly beautiful and it's got bizarre skeleton art all over it and people
[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:44.600]  being absorbed, losing their humanity, becoming machines.
[02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:46.000]  This is a short segment, David.
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:50.100]  We're going to do a bunch of world news with you in the next segment, but you were starting
[02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:53.560]  to get into the royal family.
[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:56.480]  They're constantly digging up dead bodies on their property.
[02:00:56.480 --> 02:01:01.160]  Diana put out a ledger in a video saying, Charles will kill me in a fake auto accident.
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:02.160]  He told me he would.
[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:04.160]  Then you have all of that.
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:07.040]  You have all this bizarreness where only the queen can eat swans.
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:08.040]  No one else can.
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:13.560]  I mean, it's just blaringly obvious that you've got a criminal group of psychos in control,
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:17.560]  whatever they are, just getting away with bloody murder.
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:19.280]  How is it going for them?
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:25.520]  Well, it's not going for them like it was because people are becoming more and more
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:26.520]  irreverent.
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:38.240]  I mean, I've had a stomach condition for the last 60 years of my life, which gets me nauseous
[02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:41.600]  and wanting to throw up.
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:47.840]  It's funny because every time I see the royal family doing one of their public rituals,
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:50.760]  that's when I get it, you know what I mean?
[02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:52.080]  It's about worshipping now.
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:53.080]  Yes.
[02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:54.080]  They want to be worshipped.
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:58.200]  You know, you have this thing, you can't turn your back on the queen.
[02:01:58.200 --> 02:01:59.200]  I wish I met her.
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:00.680]  You watched me.
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:06.560]  It's this irreverence they have, and we need to get irreverent with this system and not
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:09.200]  kind of bow to it, which is what they want.
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:15.040]  But what I was saying earlier, Jimmy Savile, child procurer to the elite, he was procuring
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:21.800]  children for Ted Heath on his yacht morning cloud from the now infamous children's home
[02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:23.640]  on Jersey.
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:29.400]  But he was, by his own words, introduced, this is a guy, he's a disc jockey.
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:31.600]  And in the end, he wasn't even that.
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:37.040]  But in his own words, he was introduced into the inner sanctum of the royal family by Lord
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:43.440]  Mount Batten in the 1960s, the mentor of Prince Philip and Prince Charles.
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:47.000]  And he said to do favors, I can get them things.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.000]  Yeah.
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.040]  Mount Batten is a known pedophile.
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:55.840]  He was involved in Peter Feeder at a place like the King Cora Boys Home in Belfast and
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:57.520]  what have you.
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:03:05.040]  And you ask this question, media, ask yourself this question.
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:12.880]  What is an aging disc jockey doing in the inner sanctum of the royal family so close
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:17.000]  that by his own words, and I know this from other sources who were close, who were very
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:22.640]  close friends of Princess Diana for nine years before she died, that he was asked by them
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:28.240]  to be the go-between and the mediator between Diana and Charles when their marriage was
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:29.240]  breaking down.
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:30.240]  What's going on?
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:31.880]  And I'll tell you how I knew about Savile.
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:35.240]  This is a very, very interesting story.
[02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:42.080]  In 1997, 1998, I was asked to go to a little meeting at the House of Lords.
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:44.800]  I've never even been into the House of Lords and what I was going into, and it was just
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:46.840]  a small group of people.
[02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:51.760]  And we just had a chat in the afternoon, but there was somebody there who wasn't from
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:55.120]  the House of Lords who was saying some very interesting things about the death of Princess
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:56.120]  Diana.
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:58.120]  It was about 1998, not long after it happened.
[02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:00.440]  And I called her over after us and said, how do you know all that?
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:04.680]  And she says, well, my best friend was the best friend of Diana for nine years, and they
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:06.960]  fell out about two years before Diana died.
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:09.080]  She said, I think she'll talk to you.
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:14.280]  A few weeks later, or days later, she arrives on the island where I live, and I've got all
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:15.280]  this on tape.
[02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:16.720]  It's still at home on tape.
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:17.720]  And she told me about...
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:18.720]  You've got to hear that.
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:19.720]  Yeah.
[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:20.720]  It's on one of those old tapes.
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:21.720]  It doesn't matter.
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:22.720]  It doesn't matter.
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:23.720]  Yeah.
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:24.720]  But this is the point.
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:33.160]  What she told me in 1998 was the way that the royal family treated Diana, but Jimmy Savile
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:40.680]  was on the inner sanctum of the royal family, and Princess Diana called him a sleazeback.
[02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:42.680]  And that he was a necrophiliac.
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:43.680]  And...
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:44.680]  Hold on.
[02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:47.200]  Well, I want to repeat all this and get to the rest of it when we come back from break.
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:48.200]  This is too powerful.
[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:51.880]  And you're only going to hear this type of stuff because I'm the craziest man in America.
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:54.000]  Crazy like a fox to put the truth on the air.
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.680]  It's all come out, the necrophilia, everything.
[02:04:56.680 --> 02:05:01.160]  Everything has come out except the royal family, the question is.
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:05.880]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security
[02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:10.640]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:14.560]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:02.080]  I had tried everything.
[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:04.440]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:07.640]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:12.120]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:17.840]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously
[02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:18.840]  and be satisfied.
[02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:23.320]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at InfowarsTeam.com, but I want to point out

[02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:41.160]  than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:42.680]  Now, that's results.
[02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:48.600]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfowarsTeam.com and to order just three of their

[02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:34.440]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:36.320]  leave the silver at the surface.
[02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:41.240]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry

[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:48.440]  Now I know who they were, or what they were doing, but their legacy remains here into the
[02:08:48.440 --> 02:09:14.840]  new world of silver-based products.
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:16.840]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:23.840]  We've got David Icke here, meeting him in person for the first time ever, in the middle
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:27.480]  of just a globalist political bloodbath.
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:31.880]  You've got the New York Times saying Obama, let me get the exact headline, can no longer
[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:38.120]  lead, he is completely discredited, and again, that's supposedly the paper of record, he's
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:42.480]  just a puppet now, they're trying to discard, they think he can't get any more of an agenda
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:44.120]  through forum.
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:49.280]  We've got David Cameron, the prime minister, going to Bilderberg, I've never seen a president
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:53.400]  or a prime minister during an event go to it, I guess they're like, fine, we're exposed,
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:56.560]  bring him in publicly, because we've been there when presidents or prime ministers show
[02:09:56.560 --> 02:10:00.560]  up secretly and then our inside moles tell us, I want to get back into the royal family
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:05.720]  and tell a story here, David, but we predicted that they would go quasi-public, plus I had
[02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:11.000]  some sources in the U.S. Senate also in Hollywood, but then I talked to the big BBC guy, John
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:16.200]  Sarge, their big political reporter, and he basically was admitted to, he was admitted
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:20.400]  into the facility, I wasn't allowed to say it completely, so he kind of halfway said,
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:25.040]  well, one of us is, and said, I'm going to enjoy my fancy special lunch today, and he
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:29.160]  was getting all excited about it, so hard to keep all these sources straight.
[02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:33.200]  The point is, is that they wanted to remain secret, because what they're doing is illegal
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:37.040]  setting policy, now it's out in the open, what does it mean to have David Cameron go
[02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:38.040]  there?
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:46.560]  Well, they're on a massive damage limitation operation now, because the coverage, the understanding
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:52.960]  of its existence and what goes on there means that although even people on the BBC can still
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:58.440]  go, oh no, all that stuff, never mind, you see, this is where we are, Alex, we're at
[02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:04.560]  a point now where great tracks of the public, the awakening public, are far more informed
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:09.440]  about the world and what's going on, flipping journalists on the BBC, et cetera, they're
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:11.160]  still in the land of the bewildered.
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:16.320]  She was telling me it didn't exist, still, does she know what a buffoon, or is she trying
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:18.720]  to put people back in the box?
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:24.320]  Well, I think from my experience within the BBC is don't, and you know...
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:26.560]  You were a national TV host on that.
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:33.160]  Yeah, and also so many other mainstream journalists, he's never underestimate the level of ignorance,
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:40.680]  I mean what you have with journalists is this combination which always kind of hunts impacts
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:45.240]  or hunts in pairs, it's arrogance and it's ignorance.
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:49.480]  The ignorance means they don't know their backside from their elbow in terms of what's
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:55.240]  going on in the world, but the arrogance means that if it was going on, then they would know
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:58.520]  about it because they're a journalist, and often they're of course the last people to
[02:11:58.520 --> 02:11:59.520]  know about it.
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:03.800]  John Tucker admitted that he was arrogant and said, how dare you, there's nothing secret
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:05.760]  in politics, I'd know about that.
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:08.600]  Yeah, and then he set out to expose it.
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:14.000]  Yeah, but this is the thing, when you are a journalist and you think that because you're
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:18.760]  a journalist you would know about it, if it was this big, this is the point, they have
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:21.960]  no conception of what's happening in the world.
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:27.480]  What they do is they report dots, I mean this is coming back to what you said earlier, they
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:34.600]  will report in the independent that there's a massive explosion of cancer in Britain.
[02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:39.640]  Here they will report something about vaccines, here they will report something about what's
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:44.000]  going on in politics, here they will do something about fluoride in water.
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:49.440]  What they don't do is bring the dots together so you can see the web, you can see the tapestry,
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:50.640]  they won't do that.
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:59.320]  And Bilderberg now are in a point where it's like being caught, when you're doing something
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:06.040]  you shouldn't be doing in a bedroom or something and suddenly the door opens and suddenly you're
[02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:10.040]  standing up and you're brushing yourself down, oh no, no, no, no, no, nice to see you, nothing's
[02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:11.040]  going on.
[02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:13.600]  Oh, so the Prime Minister's here.
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:19.120]  So now they're trying to go, oh well yeah, but it don't matter, I mean they don't really,
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:23.360]  oh yeah, we exist, yeah, but it don't matter, but the public are ahead of them, this is
[02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:28.680]  the point, the public are not going to accept this, they won't take this rubbish anymore
[02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:31.320]  on the scale that they have before.
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:35.960]  Now, this is very controversial, folks, but everything he's talking about because I'm
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:41.160]  a newshound, I know has been in the news, everything up to the Royal Family, past that,
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:45.640]  but I mean the, you know, we'll just get into it.
[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:46.640]  The Royal Family.
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:47.640]  Well, you wanted to get into...
[02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:48.640]  Yeah, I did.
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:49.640]  We were talking...
[02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:52.760]  We were talking about Savelle that you exposed a long time ago as a pedophile, which they
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:54.880]  admit was like the confidant of all the Royals.
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:56.280]  Yeah, exactly, well the thing is...
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:14:01.520]  A total Cooke weirdo scumbag, snow body hanging out with him constantly, what's going on?
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:09.080]  Yeah, he speaks hardly of you, mate, but he probably does now, wherever he is, oh no,
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:13.320]  no, no, no, no, no, but anyway, what I was talking about...
[02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:15.840]  Well, he just looks like a textbook pedophile.
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:18.480]  Yeah, he does, because he was.
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:25.200]  But, yeah, what I was saying earlier about this lady I met in 1998, she told me a number
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:30.600]  of things which later proved to be absolutely true, that was one of them, the rituals, the
[02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:31.600]  serious...
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:32.600]  You met her at Parliament, yeah.
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:37.640]  No, this was the friend of the person I met at Parliament who came to my house and I interviewed
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:42.480]  her on tape at length, her name was Christine Fitzgerald, she was a friend of Diana and
[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:47.080]  acknowledged to be so by the media for about nine years, but what she told me about the
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:53.720]  rituals and what goes on at places like Balmoral Castle was just beyond belief, but true.
[02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:55.200]  Say it, tell me.
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:15:00.200]  Well, I mean, literally sacrificing children, drinking their blood and all that stuff that
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:01.200]  they go on...
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:04.920]  Hey, I've been told by people that just went to Oxford who are famous, but I can't say
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:08.480]  their names, that they did devil worship and mass orgies.
[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:11.600]  Yeah, but it's the norm at that so-called level.
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:13.760]  Oh, that's low level.
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:19.360]  But the thing is, it's far more prevalent than anyone believes, that's the trouble,
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:25.120]  but the thing is that what she told me was that first of all, this is 1998, that she
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:32.040]  was an alternative healer and Diana used to go to her for healing and stuff like that
[02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:34.040]  because she had nobody else.
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:38.120]  She was just on her own in the middle of that Adam's family, that evil Adam's family
[02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:40.120]  we call the Windsors.
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:50.560]  But what she called friendly people at MI5 were doing were leaving notes for Diana, knowing
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:53.040]  that when she came, she could pick them up.
[02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:58.120]  And one of these notes, this is why the Paul Burrell letter about Diana saying that my
[02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:02.240]  husband is going to kill me in a car crash, that didn't surprise me at all, I'd heard
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:09.960]  about that years before in the sense of these MI5 notes, some of them were warning Diana
[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:12.960]  that the royal family wanted her dead.
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:17.400]  Now, is that this, the royal family wouldn't kill people, we'll just hold on a second.
[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:19.160]  It was strangle twins.
[02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:27.200]  Well, what happened when the marriage of Diana and Charles broke down is that she started
[02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:32.800]  having an affair with her bodyguard called Barry Manneke.
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:36.240]  She was apparently very, very much in love with her fellow.
[02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:44.200]  Then Barry Manneke dies in a strange motorcycle accident in which he was basically grotted
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:46.880]  across the road and pulled off his bike and killed.
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:53.000]  Now, the, it was said, there's the headline Daily Mail, Diana bodyguard killed for our
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:54.000]  affair.
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.000]  Yeah.
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:17:00.320]  What the official story was that it was an accident.
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:06.200]  Anyway, this is what Diana, Christian Fitzgerald told me happened subsequently sometime later.
[02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:14.800]  Diana came into her healing center just near Regent's Park in London in an unconsolable
[02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:16.240]  state.
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:22.680]  She was sobbing and it took some time to sit her down and calmer down and say, what's
[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:23.680]  going on?
[02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:26.760]  Because as she was sobbing, Diana was shouting.
[02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:27.760]  They killed him.
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:28.760]  They killed him.
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:29.760]  They killed him.
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:38.880]  And what Diana then said is that earlier that day, hence the response, what she called
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:44.920]  Prince Charles's senior detective had said to her, because by this time it's sometime
[02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:51.360]  after the death of the bodyguard, she was having an affair with a man now out and accepted
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:56.080]  in the open with a guy called Captain James Hewitt.
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:18:01.360]  And she said that what had happened is the senior detective of Prince Charles had just
[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:10.040]  said to her that the affair with Hewitt had to end, and if it didn't, he could end up
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:14.400]  like Barry Manneke, which is the bodyguard that's supposed to have been an accident.
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:16.240]  He was telling her they killed her.
[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:21.200]  He also said to her in the same conversation, and don't think that you're not expendable
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:23.160]  either.
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:31.560]  And Diana told her the story whereby when she'd first heard about Manneke, Barry Manneke,
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:37.320]  was when she was with Charles in a limo being driven to the steps of an airplane and outside
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:39.240]  were all the paparazzi.
[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:44.680]  And just as they were about to get out, she said, Charles leaned across and said, pity
[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:46.920]  about your friend, wasn't it?
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:54.200]  And told her with a smile on his face and an irony in his voice that Barry Manneke had
[02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:55.400]  just died.
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:57.560]  And so they killed the guy.
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:18:59.960]  I mean, that's what happens.
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:06.400]  And at the same time, this came out in the public arena as well, James Hewitt was being,
[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:12.840]  he said in his own words, was being warned by what he called a senior member of the royal
[02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:14.240]  family that-
[02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:16.160]  And tell folks who that is.
[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:21.560]  James Hewitt, he was the guy who had the affair later with Diana.
[02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:28.440]  And he said publicly that a senior member of the royal family had contacted him and said
[02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:36.600]  the affair must end or in effect, they can't be, you know, they can't say what the consequences
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:37.600]  would be.
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:40.520]  In other words, he was being threatened in the same way.
[02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:49.320]  The royal family, the Winzers, are an evil, intergenerational bloodline with human and
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:54.600]  non-human DNA and hearts of fricking stone.
[02:19:54.600 --> 02:19:57.880]  Well, folks, this is light listening here with David Ike today.
[02:19:57.880 --> 02:20:00.960]  I'm your host, Alex Counts, Big Builder Bird breakdown coming up.

[02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:38.760]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:39.760]  to serve as debt.
[02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:43.280]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public
[02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:46.600]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.
[02:20:46.600 --> 02:20:50.880]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:12.680]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White

[02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:15.040]  It's the final segment with David Ike, but we'll have live streams tomorrow night at
[02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:20.120]  infowars.com or slash Builderburg and also at davidike.com, they're going to have live
[02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:22.720]  streams if ours go down or have problems.
[02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:26.880]  If there's that problems, you can go to our streams, but davidike.com.
[02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:29.160]  David wants to speak before me at five o'clock.
[02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:32.880]  I speak at like six, but I want him to go longer, so I'll speak at six, 30 or so.
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:34.480]  I'm just going for 30 minutes.
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:36.960]  They're at the Grove overlooking where the globalists are meeting.
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:38.840]  Believe me, they're very upset by this.
[02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:39.840]  They don't like it.
[02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:42.320]  But I drug him in here because I knew he was in the newsletter.
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:47.400]  He helped run davidike.com, a Gareth Ike, who is David Ike's son.
[02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:52.280]  I thought he had the premiere here on our radio show, but what is it like having a dad
[02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:54.000]  like this?
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.000]  It's interesting.
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:59.080]  For one thing, it's not regular, but it's good.
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:02.520]  It's great because it gives me the freedom to try and be myself as well.
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:05.880]  Well you're an accomplished musician.
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:09.480]  Tell us about some of the work you're doing and your view on Builderburg.
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:13.440]  To be honest, I was a musician for a long time and I was trying like all young people
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:20.520]  do is to try and break into the industry and try and make it whatever making it means.
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:24.640]  And then I found out from the inside just how corrupt and just how bent the whole industry
[02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:28.600]  is, which kind of freaked me out a bit to be honest because obviously dad's been talking
[02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:34.640]  about stuff for a long time, but to actually see it, I was offered £100,000 on my first
[02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:42.840]  album to take the album as an advance based on me changing my surname and saying basically
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:49.280]  I didn't agree with anything that dad had ever said.
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:53.120]  I was offered it there on a plate and obviously he told me to stick it up, there are obviously.
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:59.120]  But that kind of woke me up a bit and now the music industry is so corrupt that all
[02:25:59.120 --> 02:26:02.720]  the musicians are and it's the same at Builderburg because there's lots of musicians around
[02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:03.720]  as well.
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:09.160]  There are some really, really top notch musicians that are turning their back on the establishment
[02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:15.440]  and on the music industry and doing it on their own and I'm happy to be part of that.
[02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:16.440]  It's great.
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:17.440]  Making noise.
[02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:19.320]  How many people are on your website?
[02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:25.040]  It's just garethike.com, I'm normally talking rubbish on there but it's all good fun and
[02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:27.240]  there's loads of songs on there too.
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:31.080]  garethike.com and in closing, I'm going to come back with all the news folks, all the
[02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:35.160]  info in the next 30 minutes I haven't gotten to yet, David we're talking about how they
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:39.160]  try to intimidate us and when we don't fear them then they are pathetic.
[02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:44.120]  What is the key in closing in about three minutes to defeat these people?
[02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:50.640]  Well if I could just say very quickly, Alex, this fella was at school when the ridicule
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:58.640]  of me was at its peak and he went through in nightmare at school as a kid being ridiculed
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:02.600]  day after day after day and he's still sitting by my side.
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:05.800]  This is one hell of a bloke, I'll tell you and he's a fantastic musician.
[02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:08.040]  But they're not laughing now.
[02:27:08.040 --> 02:27:12.360]  No, they're not laughing, well the bloody media are laughing but again they're laughing
[02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:13.360]  to themselves.
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:16.960]  Well, you know when they attack us it's an endorsement.
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:21.800]  The thing is, I feel from you know, bless them because they've got to come to terms
[02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:26.200]  with the fact that they've been reporting the world in a completely inaccurate way all
[02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:29.640]  their careers and the people they've been ridiculing have been people that have been
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:33.120]  doing the job that they should have been doing but aren't.
[02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:41.840]  For me, you know, if you can get to Watford tomorrow, if you can get to the Grove Hotel
[02:27:41.840 --> 02:27:44.320]  and join us, please come.
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:47.680]  Oh yeah and the police are trying to divert you away, I'll tell you after David leaves
[02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:48.680]  go ahead.
[02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:55.800]  Yeah, it's very important to listen to what Alex says after the break because they're
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:28:02.200]  trying to do everything they can to stop people getting there and to make it as difficult
[02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:03.720]  as possible.
[02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:10.480]  Please let's come in numbers, let's smile in their face and let's do what is necessary
[02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:14.920]  to make a massive statement in numbers.
[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:19.600]  Absolutely looking across at the place where it's all going on.
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:21.560]  Please make the effort.
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:24.680]  What would your dad say about three generations?
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:28.480]  What would your dad say looking down on you right now?
[02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:35.880]  Well, my father was someone who was highly intelligent and a rebel but of course didn't
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:39.680]  know anything that this was going on.
[02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:44.280]  And you know, I tell you what my father did, Alex, he said to me when I was a little kid
[02:28:44.280 --> 02:28:51.000]  and never forgot it, he said, you're never finished in life until you sit down and say
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.920]  to yourself, I'm finished.
[02:28:53.920 --> 02:28:57.680]  Until you get to that point, no one can stop you.
[02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:02.120]  And I remembered that through the ridicule years and I remember it now because you know,
[02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:07.000]  this is a great weekend and it's a great step forward but my goodness have we got some work
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.640]  to do in the years ahead, massive.
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:15.440]  But that stopped with me and got me through so much and this kid, I tell you, this fella
[02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:21.440]  went through hell as a child because of the abuse of his father and the fact that he's
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:26.360]  still going and so successful, I'm so proud of this boy, I can't tell you, and my other
[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:28.480]  kids as well, Kerry and Jamie.
[02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:33.240]  I gotta tell you, David, I get great meeting you in person after all these years and we've
[02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:38.040]  missed each other a few times narrowly but here we are now and tomorrow speaking outside
[02:29:38.040 --> 02:29:39.640]  the grove, everybody should be there.
[02:29:39.640 --> 02:29:43.720]  This is historic and you're doing great work getting people to think outside the box, David
[02:29:43.720 --> 02:29:44.720]  Ike.
[02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:45.720]  Yeah, you too, Mike.
[02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:46.720]  All right.
[02:29:46.720 --> 02:29:47.720]  Great to meet you.
[02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:48.720]  We'll be right back after the break, folks.
[02:29:48.720 --> 02:29:49.720]  Stay with us.
[02:29:49.720 --> 02:29:53.960]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.

[02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:04.000]  vaccine. You know about government secret testing. You know about port and down here
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:09.440]  in the UK. You know about plague bombs released over Scotland. You know about all this evil
[02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:14.080]  stuff. They're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines. I know you and your family are getting
[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:21.440]  cancer. Look this up. Then I get up at 6am and I go down to have breakfast. And there's
[02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:28.520]  the London Independent. Half of Britons alive in 2020 will get cancer. And it says, but
[02:34:28.520 --> 02:34:32.560]  don't worry, the government's going to have science to try to treat it. Instead of why
[02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:39.560]  is it exploding? And we know it's a cornucopia of reasons. We know it's a wide spectrum,
[02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:47.160]  but bisphenol A, fluoride, GMO, microwave radiation. And you look at the graph, that's
[02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:54.560]  only six and a half years away now. I mean, they're talking about by 2020, one in 10 kids
[02:34:54.560 --> 02:35:00.240]  being autistic. And by the way, that's not over diagnosis. It's just a name of a brain
[02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:06.520]  damaged kid that covers hundreds of things. It's kind of a catch all. It's not an over
[02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:11.360]  diagnosis. And I mean, I just have empathy for all these people and I have empathy for
[02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:19.400]  myself. I want all the life extension technologies. I'll quote, I will quote Roy Batty when he
[02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:25.680]  talks to Tyrell, the head of the Tyrell corporation, you know, I want more life and I want more
[02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:29.080]  life right now. Come on in bro, did you forget something?
[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:34.880]  Oh, awesome. Be safe. There goes David Ike's son. I'll tell you. Okay, looks like a Calvin
[02:35:34.880 --> 02:35:40.120]  Klein model. The ladies are out here. We're getting pretty excited. Let me tell you. Anyways,
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:45.560]  David Ike's son, man, what a trooper and David Ike himself. All right, continuing David
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:49.480]  Ike's son just came and he forgot some of his stuff. He had a whole camera crew in here
[02:35:49.480 --> 02:36:02.960]  with him. It is to, to, to know what I know that's proven written in books by these people.
[02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:04.920]  It upsets me. David Knight.
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:09.000]  Yeah, Alex. Hey guys, can you get me on? Hello?
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:13.440]  Absolutely. He's on. I can hear you. I thought I heard you pop in from it. That's why I went
[02:36:13.440 --> 02:36:14.440]  to you.
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:18.560]  Oh, no, they had me on talk back here. But yeah, it's pretty amazing. And it's one of
[02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:22.640]  the things we said earlier is that people need to take control of their life. They have
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:27.360]  the capability to do some of this just with the products that we're selling that help
[02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:32.400]  to pay for this operation with the survival seed bank where you can get seed that hasn't
[02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:37.920]  been genetically modified, where you can get filters to filter your water. People have
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:41.440]  to start working at the local level and it's going to be difficult. They fight us on trying
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:45.920]  to get the fluoride out of the water, but you can do it in your own home. I don't know
[02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:50.200]  if you're aware of this, Alex, but they had a sheriff that we're, we're covering that
[02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:56.360]  story on the nightly news. They had a sheriff who was arrested and taken out of office because
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:37:01.240]  he didn't go through with some gun charges that he didn't agree with on a person who
[02:37:01.240 --> 02:37:02.240]  was arrested.
[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:06.800]  Oh, no, exactly. In fact, I'm, I'm glad you brought that up because that story was up
[02:37:06.800 --> 02:37:11.600]  yesterday evening and I meant to cover it. Why don't you pull the article up and cover
[02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:15.400]  that as soon as you get that article in your hand and then I'll get into my, my Bilderberg
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:19.640]  news here because I was just seeing David off as the break ran out and I'm desperately
[02:37:19.640 --> 02:37:23.000]  trying to look at all my articles here and focus on what I want to get to on the road.
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:29.240]  It's not as easy as being back at the old info wars command center in good old Austin,
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:37.120]  Texas, but expanding on that 870 something cities last time I checked our sanctuary cities
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:43.400]  and let illegal aliens drunk drive, hit and run, commit crimes. They release them. Austin
[02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:51.520]  Texas is one, but then a sheriff arrests somebody, somebody brings them in on a gun charge that
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:58.600]  was not by a felon that was, that was victimless, that he believed was unconstitutional. And
[02:37:58.600 --> 02:38:04.160]  so he lets them go without charging them, which is what you're supposed to do. You know,
[02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:10.400]  the jury, the grand jury, those are votes, the police. If something's unconstitutional,
[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:14.280]  if it's a victimless crime, they shouldn't be stretched the law to try to throw somebody
[02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:21.080]  in jail. And now they've arrested him because God forbid the elected sheriffs and God forbid
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:25.600]  the states and the counties go, you know what, you want to nullify the constitution stuff.
[02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:29.880]  It's actually constitutional laws that are constitutional. You want to nullify that and
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:36.480]  let the federal reserve on record launder over $300 billion of drug money a year and
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:40.960]  let Wachovia and Wells Fargo launder drug money and run the drug aircraft. And when
[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:47.440]  they get caught because good agents blow the whistle, those agents get fired and then they
[02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:53.160]  get a get out of jail free card. Yeah, it's amazing to ask me if I'm using drugs. So it's
[02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:58.200]  the same thing. This is not a cop letting somebody get away with something. It's not
[02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:05.280]  constitutional to arrest somebody for a gun in their car when you're in a state that doesn't
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:07.400]  even have a law saying that. Go ahead.
[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:13.360]  That's right. They're allowing, as you pointed out, sheriffs across the country to exercise
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:19.800]  their discretion to violate law. And here's a sheriff exercising his discretion to not
[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:24.960]  violate the constitution. And he's the one who's taken out of office. I would add by
[02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:31.680]  a Republican governor there in Florida. If you have the article cover right now and we
[02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:36.120]  need to try to help this guy. I want him on. I want a legal defense fund. We need to run
[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:39.320]  him for governor and get rid of that big governor they've got in there.
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:43.960]  Well, absolutely. We talked, Jakarta was here and we talked just before you came in with
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:48.320]  David and we're following through on that. We're going to be talking to the Constitutional
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:52.960]  Sheriffs Association. And of course, at this point, we can't talk to the sheriff directly
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:58.160]  because he's facing charges. So we would have to talk to a lawyer to find out exactly what's
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:02.980]  going on there. But the amazing thing about it is, is that this person who was simply
[02:40:02.980 --> 02:40:09.360]  charged with some kind of a carry violation would have been facing a felony. Now the sheriff
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:15.720]  who did not prosecute him over this law that you could argue is a clear violation of the
[02:40:15.720 --> 02:40:19.840]  Constitution. The sheriff who did not prosecute him over that. Now the sheriff is being charged
[02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:24.200]  with a felony taking his place. I mean, I like you said, we need to do something we
[02:40:24.200 --> 02:40:29.800]  can to support. Yeah, here's the deal. Here's the deal. Here's the deal. We asked sheriffs
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:34.720]  and we asked police and we asked governors and legislators and city councilmen and women
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:38.120]  to do the right thing. And then when they do the right thing and the globalists come
[02:40:38.120 --> 02:40:42.760]  after them, we have got to put everything behind them. I'm sick of telling people in
[02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:47.960]  government that it's their job to follow the Constitution when we won't back them up. The
[02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:52.520]  reason they don't follow it is because when they do, they're overrun. So it is imperative
[02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:56.840]  when I saw that article yesterday that we get him a legal defense fund that we support
[02:40:56.840 --> 02:41:02.640]  him because it's the bare minimum. Okay, it's getting down to that. We cannot ask people
[02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:08.120]  to walk point and go the extra mile if we don't back them. That is hypocritical. And
[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:12.600]  I'm telling you, it makes me absolutely get angry. I'm so sick of people that call me
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:17.880]  and say, let's start a shooting war. Let's start killing people. And I go, really, who
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:22.720]  do we kill? Who do we start with? Well, you, you know, you lead it. I'm like, no, I'm going
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:28.440]  to try to win the info war deep on the offense and the defense. If they start a fight offensively,
[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:33.120]  I'll defensively defend myself. And if it starts Katie bar the door, but I'm not stupid enough
[02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:37.480]  to think that's some great, wonderful thing. That is a last resort of defense. I'm not
[02:41:37.480 --> 02:41:42.520]  going to a FEMA camp, but don't call me and say you're not a man because you're not
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:46.600]  leading an armed insurrection. Well, you're calling me to do it.
[02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:54.360]  Absolutely. You know, we've got a situation here where Obama has violated the constitution.
[02:41:54.360 --> 02:41:58.440]  Once we find out about it for every single person in the United States, because it's
[02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:03.120]  not just Verizon, they're going to be, they just violate the constitution. He's robbing
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:09.040]  all of us of our birthright and our privacy and using the info to enslave us as the headline
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:15.360]  says to know what we're thinking as we type it. They're robbing our privacy. I have nothing
[02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:20.920]  to hide in bed with my wife at night watching TV, but I want my privacy because I'm a free
[02:42:20.920 --> 02:42:25.360]  human being and privacy is what it's about to be a free human being. And I'm sick of
[02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:30.320]  people saying, what do you have to hide? What do you have to hide, Bilderbergs?
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:36.680]  You know, what I want to see is I want to see some congressmen, some senators bringing
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:42.200]  impeachment charges. This is a major scandal every day. They impeached Nixon. They went
[02:42:42.200 --> 02:42:46.840]  after Kissinger because they wiretapped journalists, about 17 of them during Watergate. This is
[02:42:46.840 --> 02:42:52.120]  the entire country. And they have the audacity to stand up there and say they've got legal
[02:42:52.120 --> 02:42:56.600]  safeguards in place that we don't have to worry about this. That's just ridiculous.
[02:42:56.600 --> 02:43:01.560]  Absolutely. Hey, I want you to write today, right now, go in there with Curtin and let's
[02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:07.960]  put a White House petition up for Obama to resign. I mean, it is now time for Obama to
[02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:11.800]  resign. I mean, I'm looking at this and this is what I meant to get with David Ike, but
[02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:14.880]  he got off into a bunch of other stuff, which was very informative, but this is what I want
[02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:17.680]  to ask you, David Knight, right now, and I want to get into that sheriff's name and
[02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:20.480]  so I don't have the article in front of me. I read it last night and who he is and where
[02:43:20.480 --> 02:43:25.040]  he is and how we can support him. So our Florida listeners, especially can try to get in there
[02:43:25.040 --> 02:43:29.440]  and just absolutely put as much pressure as they can on that corrupt governor for this
[02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:34.080]  miscarriage of justice they're trying to carry out against this person that just acted
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:41.200]  like a cop famously at a New York airport, let citizens film the TSA and said, you have
[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:47.400]  a right to, which is federal law and TSA policy. And the sheriff's deputy that was there as
[02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:51.960]  security became an internet hero just because he said, no, they have a constitutional right
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:56.440]  to film when the head of the airport said, you will tell him, I'm the head of the airport.
[02:43:56.440 --> 02:44:00.560]  And then he whispers to him, listen, you know, I'm the boss, better do what I say. And the
[02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:06.380]  guy looks at him and he goes, the Constitution is the boss. See, when we get rid of the Constitution
[02:44:06.380 --> 02:44:11.280]  Bill of Rights due process checks and balances, we're all wide open and naked folks. When
[02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:16.360]  somebody tries to steal your rights, it's worse than stealing your car. It's worse than
[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:20.560]  stealing your house. It's like stealing your children's future. In fact, that's what it
[02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:26.200]  is. You got to take it personal. And I see the spiritual line we're crossing. And I think
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:32.040]  we're, we're winning by like 5% right now, but it's, it's touch and go that as they admit
[02:44:32.040 --> 02:44:37.000]  the spying and the torture and the secret arrest and that they run al-Qaeda, I didn't
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:41.920]  even get to this today, but I'm going to get to it in a minute. As all of this goes on,
[02:44:41.920 --> 02:44:49.440]  as all of this happens, as all of this unfolds, if we don't send them to jail, if people don't
[02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:53.680]  get in trouble, if the pendulum doesn't swing back the other way, when all of this is coming
[02:44:53.680 --> 02:44:58.040]  out, everything we told you about, it was on record decades ago. Now the media is ready
[02:44:58.040 --> 02:45:02.520]  to admit it. Now the people won't buy into it anymore. Now it's backfiring on them. So
[02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:06.360]  they're having to admit it. If we let them just kind of get away with this, they've now
[02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:10.040]  set the precedent to go all the way. So I want to ask you about that, but then I'm going
[02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:17.840]  to add this right now. Last night, I went to bed at about midnight England time and
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:23.320]  I was laying there in bed and I had my iPhone out and I, and I typed in Bilderberg coverage.
[02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:28.160]  And for some reason in an article pulled up about Glenn Beck, it was in the Huffington
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:32.360]  Post and then I went to another article about it. I had a transcript and I said, that can't
[02:45:32.360 --> 02:45:36.840]  be true. And I went and I clicked on it and I went and watched the video and I sent it
[02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:40.440]  to the guys. I think they have it. They can tell me later if they do. I sent it to them
[02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:47.560]  like last night and it was Glenn Beck saying that basically Alex Jones is threatening his
[02:45:47.560 --> 02:45:54.480]  life and that how dare Rachel Maddow compare him to me and conspiracy theorist and that
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:59.680]  he's never said that the government was involved in.
[02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:05.240]  We just lost transmission there publicly. I'm sorry, David. We've lost transmission
[02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:09.360]  there for a second. You said that. Okay, but I'm back. I'm back now. You're back now. The
[02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:14.600]  point is, is that I never called for violence against Glenn Beck. I challenge anybody to
[02:46:14.600 --> 02:46:19.000]  find video of that. Or me even saying, you know, I'll get in a boxing ring with him like
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:24.480]  I did with O'Reilly as a joke because he's an own bully. But when you've got Rachel Maddow,
[02:46:24.480 --> 02:46:31.560]  Bill O'Reilly, Glenn Beck, CNN, the whole crew and the White House attacking you, you
[02:46:31.560 --> 02:46:39.120]  know you're doing the Lord's work. And, but I got to tell you, that clip is really creepy
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:47.760]  to try to imply that about me, which is definitely defamation to try to turn people against me.
[02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:53.160]  It shows the power structure is upset about this broadcast. It shows that because they
[02:46:53.160 --> 02:46:57.200]  know I'm real, they've got my phones tapped because they know I'm honorable. I'm not perfect,
[02:46:57.200 --> 02:47:01.840]  but I try to be a good person because they know I have the light of liberty in my heart
[02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:07.200]  that can set brush fires in the minds of men and women and then they can spread it because
[02:47:07.200 --> 02:47:12.040]  I have the torch of liberty just as all of you do. They're scared of that, David Knight.
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:17.800]  And I was saying, we're at that, that, that event horizon, we're at that point right here,
[02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:23.120]  whether we either wake up, say no, reverse the tide, send Obama to prison, man. And people
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:26.160]  say, well, he's just a puppet. Yeah, but he went further than anybody. They tried to
[02:47:26.160 --> 02:47:31.880]  roll it out as trendy and cool. America rejected it unless his whole group of arrogant crooks
[02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:37.800]  get invited. It bare minimum impeached or they have the sky is the limit and there is
[02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:41.640]  no due process. And we know we're screwed. David Knight, do you agree on nine point?
[02:47:41.640 --> 02:47:46.520]  I mean, how do you quantify that? That, that, that if we don't, if we don't reverse things,
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:52.040]  not all the way, but just turn the tide now and punish people, then it's a precedent.
[02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:56.040]  It's like we either turn it back now. We're at the cliff. We're at that spiritual cliff.
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:48:00.040]  And that's why people are saying no. Now they get, this is the cliff.
[02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:04.280]  Well, there, there is a key thing there. And that is, if you go back to the American Revolution,
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:10.080]  they had a slogan, Lex Rex. In other words, the law is king, no king but Jesus. You know,
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:13.920]  that was, that was returning back to moral principles and the rule of law rather than
[02:48:13.920 --> 02:48:19.760]  the rule of men. You had Max Kaiser on yesterday. He had some great comments about some parallels
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:26.000]  to Versailles and the end of World War one and how they put this unjust burden, economic
[02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:30.360]  burden and destroyed the German people. And that, that fermented into World War two. And
[02:48:30.360 --> 02:48:36.600]  he had some parallels to today, the way the, the banker's debt was unfairly put on the
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:41.320]  rest of the public and became a sovereign debt, the way they socialize the losses.
[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:46.680]  But I says from him that he had a real concern about Christians bringing back in something
[02:48:46.680 --> 02:48:52.560]  about the divine rights of kings. But, you know, we had a revolution both with the Reformation,
[02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:57.840]  the Ecclesiastical Revolution, and then later on with the Great Awakening, where they repudiated
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:02.760]  the idea that men were going to be in charge and set up moral principles and moral laws
[02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:08.160]  as being in charge. And we still have that today, that Christianity rightly understood
[02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:13.040]  is what brought about the American Revolution. And we have the rule of law where we have
[02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:18.440]  our elected officials are nothing more than stewards, just like you've got going back to
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:23.800]  the Lord of the Rings, Denethor, who was the steward, and became the person who wanted
[02:49:23.800 --> 02:49:27.040]  to be the king and not just a steward. And that's what we're seeing today.
[02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:31.560]  George Washington was offered the kingship and when, and when King George III heard
[02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:34.960]  he turned it down, he said he's the greatest man who's ever lived.
[02:49:34.960 --> 02:49:35.960]  That's right. That's right.
[02:49:35.960 --> 02:49:39.400]  Because nobody'd ever turned down kingship but Jesus Christ.
[02:49:39.400 --> 02:49:46.600]  But today we have people who are elected as stewards who swear obedience to the Constitution
[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:52.120]  because it is the higher authority and they act as if they are ruling by the divine right
[02:49:52.120 --> 02:49:57.680]  of kings. They act as if they are a king as if they are a God and they have reputed, reputed
[02:49:57.680 --> 02:50:01.960]  everything in the Constitution. We're not talking about journalists who had their phone
[02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:06.040]  records turned over. That created quite a stir and rightfully so when we saw that with
[02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:07.040]  the AP.
[02:50:07.040 --> 02:50:11.200]  But they did the same thing now to every Verizon customer and the truth be known, they've
[02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:12.200]  done it to everyone.
[02:50:12.200 --> 02:50:17.680]  They've stated that they were spying on everybody with the third biggest company in the country
[02:50:17.680 --> 02:50:19.560]  with over 100 million customers.
[02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:20.560]  And that was just yesterday.
[02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:21.560]  This is our 100 million homes.
[02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:25.400]  And that was just yesterday. Today it breaks out about all of the data spying that's going
[02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:26.800]  on, not just phone records.
[02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:27.800]  So where do we...
[02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:33.960]  And then meanwhile, Petraeus, articles at infowars.com and right hand side of recordsreport.com,
[02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:41.720]  Petraeus is meeting to try to sell the idea of the NSA Google takeover when he himself
[02:50:41.720 --> 02:50:47.080]  was destroyed with them spying on his records and emails with his girlfriend.
[02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:51.520]  What business is it who General Petraeus is dating? I'm not endorsing what he did, but
[02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:58.080]  I mean the FBI was spying on the head of the CIA. I mean this guy is endorsing the noose
[02:50:58.080 --> 02:50:59.080]  that hung him.
[02:50:59.080 --> 02:51:02.000]  We'll be right back with more Goldberg news. I'm live from London.

[02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:34.200]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[02:52:34.200 --> 02:52:38.440]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[02:52:38.440 --> 02:52:42.000]  to serve as debt. This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central
[02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:45.400]  bank issuing to public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than
[02:52:45.400 --> 02:52:46.400]  a standing army.
[02:52:46.400 --> 02:52:49.760]  Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary
[02:52:49.760 --> 02:52:57.520]  system. Call for your copy 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237.
[02:52:57.520 --> 02:53:05.240]  Hi, my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered
[02:53:05.240 --> 02:53:10.000]  severe hot flashes which prevented me from sleeping all night. It was so hard to work
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:15.720]  because it continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell. I was exhausted and depleted.
[02:53:15.720 --> 02:53:20.120]  After only three weeks on one world way, I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally
[02:53:20.120 --> 02:53:24.680]  again. I feel energized and strong. This is an amazing product.
[02:53:24.680 --> 02:53:28.560]  It is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10%
[02:53:28.560 --> 02:53:34.080]  of its protein content as glutathione. But due to toxicity and aging, it does not. Could
[02:53:34.080 --> 02:53:38.440]  glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body? If you
[02:53:38.440 --> 02:53:42.680]  restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and organs,
[02:53:42.680 --> 02:53:47.360]  then as a result, your glands and organs work better. Imagine the quality of life improvement
[02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:55.680]  you might have. To order One World Way, call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325 or visit
[02:53:55.680 --> 02:54:21.680]  OneWorldWay.com. That's One World W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:54:21.680 --> 02:54:45.840]  I'm here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that you are not going to do bad things. Even
[02:54:45.840 --> 02:54:50.560]  if you don't believe in God, the wicked always want to say that there's no God. Let's just
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:56.640]  admit there's evil in this world and there's good, and that it feels better to do good.
[02:54:56.640 --> 02:55:03.760]  And it also builds a better society. But to be able to do good, you have to learn what
[02:55:03.760 --> 02:55:12.160]  good is. And so many people that serve corruption and serve darkness, they really think they're
[02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:16.420]  doing good. You know, look at these articles. There's one up on the side. It's Alex Jones
[02:55:16.420 --> 02:55:22.160]  infiltrates the Grove Hotel by boat. Alex Jones sensationally. And I appreciate that
[02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:26.400]  blur, but it really wouldn't even so much sensationally. We found a loophole in their
[02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:36.120]  fencing and everything with these tour services on boats. You know, the famous English waterways
[02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:42.640]  they used to use like roads in the 17, 18, 1900s. We go right by the hotel. Right as
[02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:47.480]  the prime ministers arriving, there's like helicopters and stuff landing. And I'm bullhorring
[02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:52.480]  them. They just freaked out. Because instead of being 300, 400 yards away, I was right
[02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:57.320]  up on it. We got a bunch of those videos coming up. David nice can do a four tower of overdrive
[02:55:57.320 --> 02:56:06.720]  and info wars.com forward forward slash build a burger and force.com for sale. Hey, Alex,
[02:56:06.720 --> 02:56:11.800]  I think we lost you there. We're going to air David's. Okay, we're going to air some
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:16.840]  of the stuff in overdrive in the next hour and info wars.com forward slash build a bird
[02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:21.520]  or info wars.com forward slash show and some stations carry it. My interview with the Huffington
[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:26.160]  Post was pretty powerful. A channel for interview. I've got a David. I can review that was even
[02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:29.320]  more powerful. He's selling air out there. I was right to upload that to YouTube. So you
[02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:33.120]  can have that by the end of the hour. Now, but there'll be a lot of stuff up on info
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:39.680]  wars.com. I don't really know what to say right now. Other than they didn't want coverage.
[02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:47.520]  It is a orgy of coverage. It is wall to wall, crazy coverage. And they're being forced to
[02:56:47.520 --> 02:56:51.520]  admit they're setting policy in secret. So now they're going from denying it existed is
[02:56:51.520 --> 02:56:57.240]  trying to hide it in point view. And when we find out the public finds out that $85 billion
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:57:02.480]  of us taxpayer money a month goes to foreign bankers to bail out crises they created and
[02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:07.440]  align their pockets and that these some of these people are worth that hundreds of billions
[02:57:07.440 --> 02:57:10.880]  but they leverage trillions. When they say Bill Gates is worth $80 billion, the richest
[02:57:10.880 --> 02:57:14.960]  guy folks, that's pure bull. You know, these people are pretty much tax exempt. When you
[02:57:14.960 --> 02:57:19.560]  look at what they're doing, you understand that they are leveraging it all to create
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:24.560]  a tyranny to bring in eugenics and that they wouldn't even pay for the two million pounds
[02:57:24.560 --> 02:57:28.160]  for the fence and the security. That's like three and a half million dollars. I mean,
[02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:33.240]  that's like a quarter in my pocket. Okay, a couple million dollars to them. And I've
[02:57:33.240 --> 02:57:36.840]  now had a chance. I'm just going to leave it at this talk to inside sources that aren't
[02:57:36.840 --> 02:57:42.400]  just government sources, which is incredible sources this year. Media, government, so much
[02:57:42.400 --> 02:57:45.760]  is coming over the weekend. That's all I can tell you. And we've got stuff that just,
[02:57:45.760 --> 02:57:50.320]  I can't even believe how sensational, I can't even believe how over the top, you know, some
[02:57:50.320 --> 02:57:55.160]  of this information is. Well, Alex, they are treating the staff so horribly. Go ahead.
[02:57:55.160 --> 02:57:58.360]  You're going to have a Bilderberg festival there tomorrow. Now live coverage is going
[02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:03.280]  to continue live on the internet at infoworse.com forward slash B for Bilderberg. There's going
[02:58:03.280 --> 02:58:06.560]  to be a Bilderberg festival. What time is that going to start tomorrow? Your time is
[02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:14.000]  that five o'clock your time? It'll really start cranking up about about 11 to noon central
[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:22.480]  or noon to one Eastern at infoworse.com. But we've got bombshell info that is so big and
[02:58:22.480 --> 02:58:28.360]  I'm so busy. I haven't even gotten into collating that'll be up on infoworse.com tomorrow and
[02:58:28.360 --> 02:58:32.400]  the next day and obviously at great places like drudgerport.com. David night. Great job.
[02:58:32.400 --> 02:58:37.960]  I hope you'll take some calls too. In the next hour before you even get to some of these
[02:58:37.960 --> 02:58:42.480]  interview clubs. We just had a few hours ago out there on the grassy knoll over that great

[02:58:58.960 --> 02:59:05.000]  globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

[02:59:56.920 --> 03:00:11.120]  Jones Broadcasting Network. Big brother mainstream media government coverups. You want answers?
[03:00:11.120 --> 03:00:20.080]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas.
[03:00:20.080 --> 03:00:33.120]  Alex Jones. All right, I'm going to get out of here folks so that I can go finish some work I'm
[03:00:33.120 --> 03:00:38.880]  doing. It's two o'clock central over there three o'clock. It's eight o'clock over here. I'm going
[03:00:38.880 --> 03:00:45.120]  to go finish a bunch of work and try to get my mind around. Try to get my mind around all the big
[03:00:45.120 --> 03:00:52.720]  breaking insider Intel police famous BBC people giving us key info. Bilderberg reportedly had a
[03:00:52.720 --> 03:00:59.000]  couple big that BBC and somebody else in yesterday and today. It's a tape interviews. I don't know
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:04.040]  if those are going to air, but media was going in. So I got to write that down. See, I've got to
[03:01:04.040 --> 03:01:10.040]  just think about all the stuff. I got to get my writers here that we witnessed in the sources. So
[03:01:10.040 --> 03:01:17.080]  media went in. Are they holding stories? That's that's a report. And then we've also got insiders
[03:01:17.080 --> 03:01:22.760]  inside that they knew that we were in there talking to the crew that worked there so that when the
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:29.480]  people were so mean to them that they talked to us. So we've got inside sources that way. And we've
[03:01:29.480 --> 03:01:34.120]  got the big speeches tomorrow. And really the big overwhelming story here is there's such massive
[03:01:34.680 --> 03:01:40.360]  national international transnational coverage of this. And most of it is pretty serious coverage.
[03:01:40.360 --> 03:01:48.440]  It's not simpering and arrogant. Only the BBC and I did like six or seven of those in the last two
[03:01:48.440 --> 03:01:55.400]  days. This is like five or six yesterday and a couple today. Only some of the BBC were like it
[03:01:55.400 --> 03:01:59.640]  doesn't exist. It isn't real. And I'm like, of course, it's real. Why are you saying that? I'm
[03:01:59.640 --> 03:02:07.560]  trying to make you angry. So just amazing things going on here, David Knight. David, what's coming
[03:02:07.560 --> 03:02:13.320]  up in the next segment? Well, we've got a interview that you did yesterday with someone you were
[03:02:13.320 --> 03:02:18.840]  talking about the NSA and the Project Prism. And we're going to be playing that in the next
[03:02:18.840 --> 03:02:22.680]  segment. That's an excellent interview there. And we've got some other interviews that you've got.
[03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:27.400]  And we're going to be taking some phone calls and ask people what they think about this massive
[03:02:27.960 --> 03:02:32.520]  criminal actions by our government that's now been exposed in the mainstream media. We've
[03:02:32.520 --> 03:02:35.960]  been talking about it. We've been telling people that it's there. We've had whistleblowers talking
[03:02:35.960 --> 03:02:40.280]  about it. Now it's been released. We've seen the documents. We've even got the New York Times
[03:02:40.280 --> 03:02:45.640]  writing editorials talking about how the president has now lost all credibility on this issue,
[03:02:45.640 --> 03:02:51.800]  although later struck that particular statement. But it's still a scathing indictment of Obama.
[03:02:51.800 --> 03:02:57.880]  And the question is, when are our congressmen going to indict him for crimes? This is far more
[03:02:57.880 --> 03:03:02.760]  pervasive than anything that Nixon ever did. Nixon was right. Yeah, we need to beat that drum.
[03:03:02.760 --> 03:03:06.360]  That's why the power structure is trying to race to the finish line right now,
[03:03:06.360 --> 03:03:10.680]  because they want to kill the Tea Party. That's why you see the Republican Party
[03:03:11.240 --> 03:03:18.840]  and all these establishment people like Tucker Carlson and Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly coming
[03:03:18.840 --> 03:03:26.840]  out against infowars.com along with Rachel Maddow and CNN and MSNBC and all of them,
[03:03:26.840 --> 03:03:31.400]  because the old power structure is dying. Well, don't forget National Review.
[03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:35.880]  Don't forget National Review. They basically come after you. They even threw Republican
[03:03:35.880 --> 03:03:42.040]  congressmen under the bus about this DHS MO situation, even though we linked to the RFPs from
[03:03:42.040 --> 03:03:47.960]  the DHS on that. I know. So they're desperately trying to keep us on the reservation. They're
[03:03:47.960 --> 03:03:52.680]  using the same old tricks of denying all this to exist. And all I want is a free country.
[03:03:52.680 --> 03:03:56.120]  All I want is a future for my children. They are buying thousands of armored vehicles.
[03:03:56.120 --> 03:03:59.880]  They are training for war with us. The manuals are public. They are buying billions of bullets.
[03:04:00.680 --> 03:04:07.240]  And now Glenn Beck is resorting to saying that I'm threatening to try to kill him or death
[03:04:07.240 --> 03:04:12.600]  threaten him. And he may try to use some fake emails, some stalker sent or some joke,
[03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:16.440]  but it just shows they're getting really desperate. They want me demonized. They want
[03:04:16.440 --> 03:04:21.320]  infowars.com demonized because they know we're telling the truth. And we'll just have continued
[03:04:21.320 --> 03:04:27.160]  coverage tomorrow on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and on the YouTube channels and of course

[03:08:28.840 --> 03:08:35.080]  in Austin. But we do have some interviews that Alex has done in London yesterday. We have one
[03:08:35.080 --> 03:08:43.080]  about the breaking crisis with the NSA, Verizon, and the Prism scandal that was breaking yesterday
[03:08:43.080 --> 03:08:48.600]  and today. Every day, we're finding out new information about new areas of our life,
[03:08:48.600 --> 03:08:54.360]  where the government is spying on every single thing we do. And Alex has been talking about
[03:08:54.360 --> 03:08:58.920]  this for quite some time, just like he's been talking about Bilderberg. Now, people are seeing
[03:08:58.920 --> 03:09:03.560]  it for themselves. We see secret documents being released, and we've got a video coming up right
[03:09:03.560 --> 03:09:07.640]  here. And we're going to be taking your calls afterwards to talk about some of this. The number
[03:09:07.640 --> 03:09:16.600]  to call is 800-259-9231. That's 800-259-9231. We're going to be taking calls, and we're going to
[03:09:16.600 --> 03:09:21.560]  be looking at some of Alex's interviews that have been happening in London. Right now, this is an
[03:09:21.560 --> 03:09:26.920]  interview that he had about the Verizon and the data leakage charges. So here we go.
[03:09:26.920 --> 03:09:33.160]  It's been our job and our main goal, just to expose their powerful lobbying groups and
[03:09:33.160 --> 03:09:38.280]  organizations like Bilderberg above government that are transnational, that come in and basically
[03:09:38.280 --> 03:09:43.800]  lobby governments to give them corporate bailouts, to buy weapons systems. There's all sorts of
[03:09:43.800 --> 03:09:47.880]  collusion going on here. There were Lockheed Martin investigations in the 70s. That's why
[03:09:47.880 --> 03:09:53.320]  the founder, Prince Bernhardt, had to step down. There's just all sorts of shady goings on,
[03:09:53.320 --> 03:09:59.400]  price-fixing, you name it. Over the years, via WikiLeaks, but before that, even the BBC and
[03:09:59.400 --> 03:10:05.800]  others broke a lot of news out of Bilderberg where they were, indeed, inside setting policy.
[03:10:05.800 --> 03:10:11.640]  And they refused Freedom of Information Act requests as well, saying that policy is being
[03:10:11.640 --> 03:10:16.200]  made. But then the Bilderberg group separately says policy is not being made. The Bilderberg
[03:10:16.200 --> 03:10:24.440]  group is basically a world shadow government. It is a legendary organization within government,
[03:10:24.440 --> 03:10:28.520]  within people in Congress and your parliament. They all know about it. They all lust to be
[03:10:28.520 --> 03:10:33.080]  invited because if you get invited here, you know, being president or prime minister. But then,
[03:10:33.080 --> 03:10:40.040]  meanwhile, they tell the public it doesn't exist. Well, in the past, the New York Times,
[03:10:40.040 --> 03:10:44.520]  just four years ago, said that I was in Chantilly, at a Bilderberg meeting, covering it,
[03:10:44.520 --> 03:10:50.600]  and that it was imaginary, that I imagined helicopters and secret service and black vehicles.
[03:10:50.600 --> 03:10:55.640]  And they told their readers that, that I had a full-on and same breakdown, and that it didn't
[03:10:55.640 --> 03:11:00.360]  exist. But we had all the YouTube videos. I made a film that was seen more than 40 million times
[03:11:00.360 --> 03:11:06.360]  online, the Obama deception, showing it also, they were discredited. So I've never seen such
[03:11:06.360 --> 03:11:11.480]  a news blackout as we have in the United States. It's been better here, but the dam has broken
[03:11:11.480 --> 03:11:17.560]  on the blackout of Bilderberg. You've got your prime minister coming here today. That shows that
[03:11:17.560 --> 03:11:22.520]  they've gone from trying to be secret so they're not under the light of publicity, to now saying,
[03:11:22.520 --> 03:11:25.560]  okay, we're no big deal. We're kind of like a G20 meeting.
[03:11:25.560 --> 03:11:29.480]  It's a curious coalition here. Not everybody's going to agree with some of your, say,
[03:11:29.480 --> 03:11:34.520]  your politics. I stated in America on other issues. I mean, there's some very left-wing voices here,
[03:11:34.520 --> 03:11:38.840]  you're hardcore libertarian. How do you map through those differences?
[03:11:38.840 --> 03:11:44.840]  Well, I'm really a populist who does believe in libertarian ideas when they're actually
[03:11:45.560 --> 03:11:51.000]  brought forth from the grassroots. The left-wing is here. He probably thought Obama was a bit
[03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:55.080]  of a hero. You don't agree with those guys, do you? Hey, let me ask you, you think Obama's a hero?
[03:11:55.080 --> 03:11:57.080]  No!
[03:11:57.080 --> 03:11:59.080]  No!
[03:11:59.080 --> 03:12:01.560]  Hey, do you think George Bush is a hero?
[03:12:01.560 --> 03:12:03.560]  No!
[03:12:03.560 --> 03:12:10.200]  Okay, no, no. They know the system is a fraud. They know it's a scam. They know there's people
[03:12:10.200 --> 03:12:14.280]  above prime ministers and presidents that are pulling the strings. We want to talk about the
[03:12:14.280 --> 03:12:19.640]  puppeteers, not the puppets. And that's what's happening is really an end of the 90s. What we're
[03:12:19.640 --> 03:12:26.200]  seeing happen is an end of the incredible naivete of the general public to actually believe the
[03:12:26.200 --> 03:12:30.680]  media and the government when they say there's no secret rooms, there's no manipulation going on.
[03:12:30.680 --> 03:12:35.560]  But there's been no secret anymore. No, but they tried to keep it secret. They tried to have media
[03:12:35.560 --> 03:12:40.280]  they controlled for decades, say it didn't exist. Or now that it doesn't have any power. Or those
[03:12:40.280 --> 03:12:45.320]  of us that criticize it are conspiracy theorists. When we've gotten their minutes, we know they
[03:12:45.320 --> 03:12:50.200]  created the European Union as a system to implode countries under corporate governance. We know
[03:12:50.200 --> 03:12:56.920]  that they lobbied years before for the Iraq War I and Iraq War II and tried to create a climate
[03:12:56.920 --> 03:13:02.840]  so those wars would happen. This is about as evil as you get on this planet. This is a global
[03:13:02.840 --> 03:13:07.800]  corporate government that is trying to take over the entire planet. They're not in full control yet,
[03:13:07.800 --> 03:13:13.800]  but they are a world government that is basically learning to walk right now and it wants to run.
[03:13:13.800 --> 03:13:18.920]  Right now on today, on the date of this meeting to happen, we've had this story that the
[03:13:18.920 --> 03:13:23.560]  National Security Agency in New York Country in America has got access to all sorts of U.K.,
[03:13:23.560 --> 03:13:31.080]  U.S. data, tech company data. Some of the tech bosses are in there. What's your response
[03:13:31.720 --> 03:13:36.840]  to that development? Do you trust data in your own country from these large tech companies?
[03:13:37.800 --> 03:13:43.400]  For 18 years on air, I've exposed that all communications in the Western world, whether
[03:13:43.400 --> 03:13:49.640]  it's the EU, the U.K. or the United States, run through hubs and are recorded. In the old days,
[03:13:49.640 --> 03:13:54.440]  it was just text they say, this is all in Congress. The media just wouldn't touch it because we're
[03:13:54.440 --> 03:14:00.280]  free countries. We're not recording you and now they come out and say, you know what, we've audio
[03:14:00.280 --> 03:14:05.320]  recorded everything you've said the last decade, so watch it. This is the establishment we're
[03:14:05.320 --> 03:14:10.440]  coming on saying, you bet we're listening and you bet if you criticize us, the IRS is going to come
[03:14:10.440 --> 03:14:14.840]  and we're going to audit you. So sit down and shut up, peasants. That's what's happening and I was
[03:14:14.840 --> 03:14:21.160]  called a conspiracy theorist on national U.S. TV. Alex Jones says the government's spying on you
[03:14:21.160 --> 03:14:27.640]  without warrants and recording your phone calls. When it was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
[03:14:27.640 --> 03:14:37.160]  $9 billion to fund the upgrade of huge computer hubs in all telecommunications to record everything.
[03:14:37.160 --> 03:14:42.920]  They have giant NSA bases down the street from my house in Austin, Texas. They have a huge one
[03:14:42.920 --> 03:14:48.440]  in San Antonio, 60 miles away. They have them in every state, giant compounds with black helicopters
[03:14:48.440 --> 03:14:52.520]  of men with guns and machine guns recording everything. And if you go and put a camera on it,
[03:14:52.520 --> 03:14:58.280]  they come out and arrest you. And then the media won't cover it because those bases don't exist.
[03:14:58.280 --> 03:15:04.040]  They're right next to Walmart in San Antonio. Thousands of acres, giant compounds, helicopters,
[03:15:04.040 --> 03:15:09.000]  men with masks going. None of it exists. And then I'm going, it exists. They're like, crazy,
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:13.720]  crazy man. There's no NSA. There's no spying. There's no torture. There's no corruption.
[03:15:13.720 --> 03:15:17.640]  The government loves you. Everything's fine. Here's Morgan cares about you.
[03:15:19.480 --> 03:15:23.960]  I'm here to tell everybody something right now. I'm going to tell all the globalists and all the
[03:15:23.960 --> 03:15:41.080]  sellouts. The answer to your 1984 tyranny is 1776. And by the way, 1776 is not about America versus
[03:15:41.080 --> 03:15:48.120]  England. The parliament, the parliament, the parliament almost voted to give freedom to the
[03:15:48.120 --> 03:15:52.600]  colonies and the team came down and demanded they declare war. The fight in the colonies was
[03:15:52.600 --> 03:15:58.440]  a thousand year war. They'd had in these aisles for freedom in England, in Ireland, in Scotland,
[03:15:58.440 --> 03:16:04.280]  in Wales, everywhere. It's a human fight for the Magna Carta that Tony Blair, when he first got
[03:16:04.280 --> 03:16:09.080]  elected declared, he would kill. That is treason. You want to know why you're a slave? They're trying
[03:16:09.080 --> 03:16:15.000]  to kill your Magna Carta, your new process. So they're above the law. And that's why we're here.
[03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:23.080]  The New World Order is not about the law. And liberty is rising.
[03:16:28.200 --> 03:16:34.120]  It's just been revealed that almost all of those networks have a back passage as it were in
[03:16:34.120 --> 03:16:39.400]  from the US government, the NSA. What would you say to individuals in terms of what this means
[03:16:39.400 --> 03:16:47.800]  about the relationship with the state? Google is the state. Facebook is the state. Google was set
[03:16:47.800 --> 03:16:53.960]  up with funding from NQTEL and the CIA. That's mainstream news. But government has more scrutiny
[03:16:53.960 --> 03:17:00.120]  on it than private corporations. So they set up these subgroups under it so that they can then
[03:17:00.120 --> 03:17:04.440]  claim that they have corporate deniability. Google, Facebook, Twitter, all of them serve the
[03:17:04.440 --> 03:17:09.080]  global corporate interests. They're spying on everybody. Google's on record, driving on Google
[03:17:09.080 --> 03:17:15.800]  cars, stealing everyone's data, breaking into passcodes. Meanwhile, you do that with some cops.
[03:17:15.800 --> 03:17:20.040]  You go to jail in the UK. That's just because the low-level cops aren't supposed to get into the
[03:17:20.040 --> 03:17:25.880]  big-time game of spying on people, hacking phones. You hack phones, you go to jail. You spy on
[03:17:25.880 --> 03:17:32.200]  everybody illegally. Well, they make you king. Do you have a problem with them using this technology
[03:17:32.200 --> 03:17:40.280]  to root out security problems? The Al Qaeda threat is run by the globalists. They created them on
[03:17:40.280 --> 03:17:45.160]  record. They ran them in Libya. They run them in Syria. The New World Order is staging the bombings
[03:17:45.160 --> 03:17:49.960]  in India. It's provocaturing the bombings here. It is going out and finding mentally ill people.
[03:17:49.960 --> 03:17:53.960]  In every case, even the New York Times reports, and they're totally discredited, but they have to
[03:17:53.960 --> 03:17:58.440]  admit that our government has created over 100 fake terror attacks by going out and finding
[03:17:58.440 --> 03:18:04.920]  mentally ill people. They used the pretext of a terror threat to spy on everyone, and now it turns
[03:18:04.920 --> 03:18:10.760]  out it's to spy on constitutionalists, nationalist people that love freedom, members of Congress
[03:18:10.760 --> 03:18:15.960]  are being spied on by the NSA. Why? Because they're Al Qaeda? No. Big Brother uses the
[03:18:15.960 --> 03:18:20.840]  excuse of Al Qaeda that they run to take our liberty. And we're now at a critical crossroads,
[03:18:20.840 --> 03:18:24.600]  because all this is coming out. And if people make the decision collectively to say, well,
[03:18:24.600 --> 03:18:30.440]  that's okay, then we go deep into tyranny. We're at that crossroads. We're all this open evil.
[03:18:30.440 --> 03:18:35.560]  Either wakes us up and we reverse the pendulum from tyranny back to liberty, or we just kind of give
[03:18:35.560 --> 03:18:40.680]  into it and go, okay, Bob got disappeared because, you know, he might have been a security threat,
[03:18:40.680 --> 03:18:46.360]  or yeah, they're spying on you. That's to keep us safe. This is pure classical authoritarianism,
[03:18:46.360 --> 03:18:51.320]  and it has come to the United States. It has come to England. It has come to Europe.
[03:18:51.320 --> 03:18:56.600]  Well, you seem to have won the argument amongst this audience, but the masses don't seem to care
[03:18:56.600 --> 03:19:00.840]  about their privacy being taken from them. And while you hear the speech on mass, I don't speak
[03:19:00.840 --> 03:19:05.560]  for them. I'm saved by evidence. They seem to put whatever, you know, or their personal Facebook
[03:19:05.560 --> 03:19:09.160]  on Facebook for free from everybody. Or the tweets. Because they were promised by Google and all
[03:19:09.160 --> 03:19:12.920]  of them that they weren't saving it. But now that they're discovering that they were lied to,
[03:19:12.920 --> 03:19:17.560]  they are becoming angry. And the average person is doing nothing wrong. So they feel like, well,
[03:19:17.560 --> 03:19:21.320]  that's okay. The government's nice. But now they found out the government's corrupt and run by
[03:19:21.320 --> 03:19:27.240]  private, piratical interest. And now people are upset saying, I don't want you to have my data.
[03:19:32.280 --> 03:19:37.480]  All right, that's Alex Jones yesterday at Bilderberg with an interview talking about data
[03:19:38.040 --> 03:19:41.640]  and the stealing of it, the stealing of the American people's data. We're going to be right back.
[03:19:41.640 --> 03:19:46.280]  We're going to talk to Gordon in London about what he thinks about that. We'll be right back after
[03:19:46.280 --> 03:19:50.120]  this break with more from the Alex Jones show. Stay tuned.
[03:20:17.160 --> 03:20:22.280]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new

[03:21:10.920 --> 03:21:15.640]  telling you that they're going to do it with what just happened in Cyprus serving as a blueprint for
[03:21:15.640 --> 03:21:20.680]  future bank bailouts. If you are concerned about keeping your money, why not consider storing
[03:21:20.680 --> 03:21:29.800]  your wealth in gold and silver? Call me Gary Cooper at 1-800-686-2237 extension 130. Together

[03:22:05.400 --> 03:22:11.800]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional
[03:22:11.800 --> 03:22:16.840]  burglars into thinking someone is home watching televisions. As a recent widow living alone,
[03:22:16.840 --> 03:22:21.960]  it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing
[03:22:21.960 --> 03:22:27.320]  motors in the distance will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[03:22:27.320 --> 03:22:33.640]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer and they're so easy to use.
[03:22:33.640 --> 03:22:38.600]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go plus they're so affordable that we have one upstairs
[03:22:38.600 --> 03:22:46.680]  and downstairs. Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping. Order your fake TV by calling 877-5
[03:22:46.680 --> 03:22:59.160]  Fake TV or go to faketv.com. That's 877-532-5388 or faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

[03:23:23.320 --> 03:23:30.040]  dangerous chlorine, all types of fluoride, pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and unhealthy

[03:24:12.040 --> 03:24:15.960]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight standing in for Alex and we are in
[03:24:15.960 --> 03:24:21.000]  overdrive. We're going to take some of your calls. We just had an interview that was conducted
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:26.280]  yesterday. We just aired in the last segment and one of the things that stuck out about that to me
[03:24:26.280 --> 03:24:32.200]  when Alex was talking to the interviewer, he said we want to talk about the puppeteers and not the
[03:24:32.200 --> 03:24:38.120]  puppets and that's really true but unfortunately that's not what you typically see in the media.
[03:24:38.120 --> 03:24:44.120]  We just had an article go up today that was a transcript from yesterday's Rush Limbaugh show
[03:24:44.120 --> 03:24:49.880]  and he said the U.S. press is blaming George Bush for Obama's unprecedented eavesdropping.
[03:24:50.760 --> 03:24:55.320]  Now that's true. The eavesdropping is unprecedented in both scope and scale
[03:24:56.920 --> 03:25:02.760]  but it is the mainstream media is blaming Bush, many of them, some of them like the
[03:25:02.760 --> 03:25:08.680]  New York Times is actually going after Obama but Rush wants to deflect criticism onto Obama.
[03:25:08.680 --> 03:25:14.760]  We know that what they're doing here is they're just playing partisan politics.
[03:25:14.760 --> 03:25:19.560]  Rush wants to go after Obama, many others in the media want to go after Bush.
[03:25:19.560 --> 03:25:24.120]  Let's agree that they were both problems. Let's agree that these problems are systemic.
[03:25:24.120 --> 03:25:29.080]  Let's talk about the fact that we've got James Clapper who's head of the NSA who lied to Congress,
[03:25:29.960 --> 03:25:34.280]  lied to the Senate in testimony in March saying they weren't doing this sort of thing.
[03:25:34.280 --> 03:25:40.040]  They are violating even FISA and the Patriot Act. Those in turn violate our Constitution.
[03:25:40.680 --> 03:25:44.840]  Where's Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity in terms of getting rid of the Patriot Act and FISA which
[03:25:44.840 --> 03:25:50.920]  these people unlawfully have enacted, unconstitutionally enacted to give them access to do things but
[03:25:50.920 --> 03:25:55.640]  now they've gone even beyond that. They've even exceeded that unconstitutional authority they've
[03:25:55.640 --> 03:26:00.120]  granted to themselves. Let's go to Gordon in London. You've been waiting for a while Gordon.
[03:26:00.120 --> 03:26:09.480]  What do you think about all of this and about Bilderberg? Well, this is just an amazing breakthrough
[03:26:10.520 --> 03:26:14.920]  for as far as I can see. I hope for the Western world there's no doubt about it.
[03:26:14.920 --> 03:26:22.360]  It's a real opportunity for people to really wake up and start taking back their rights
[03:26:22.360 --> 03:26:27.480]  in the Western world, not just America. Unfortunately, Americans do seem to be
[03:26:27.480 --> 03:26:32.680]  bearing the brunt of their liberty being taken away from them. I've been watching
[03:26:33.640 --> 03:26:42.120]  an awful lot on the internet, largely from Alec. I just cannot believe what an amazing job he's doing.
[03:26:43.000 --> 03:26:46.440]  Let me tell you Gordon, I appreciate that. Let me tell you they're spying on you too.
[03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:50.840]  It's Americans who are doing it but they're not just spying on every American.
[03:26:50.840 --> 03:26:54.760]  They're spying on you too. That was the whole point with FISA. They asserted that they had the
[03:26:54.760 --> 03:26:59.240]  right to record all of your phone conversations. It's just that they said we're not doing it to
[03:26:59.240 --> 03:27:03.880]  Americans and now it comes out as we all knew they were actually doing it to Americans. They're
[03:27:03.880 --> 03:27:08.440]  not only looking at who you're calling and when you're calling, they are saving the content and
[03:27:08.440 --> 03:27:12.760]  they're putting it in the data center there in Utah. It's not just us, you're in this too,
[03:27:12.760 --> 03:27:19.080]  but we've got to fight it here. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Yeah, no, no, no. I understand that and
[03:27:19.080 --> 03:27:24.200]  I'm not ignorant of this. I've worked and they're probably listening to me now because I've worked
[03:27:24.200 --> 03:27:32.440]  in as a servant who's very senior people in a very large corporation. During that period,
[03:27:32.440 --> 03:27:39.560]  I suffered so much psychological bullying. It was unbelievable. I knew they were listening
[03:27:39.560 --> 03:27:47.560]  to everything that I said and it hasn't left me. 2013, I know you guys are Christians,
[03:27:47.560 --> 03:27:56.520]  I certainly am. I'm open to this whole new global awakening thing as well. I know that
[03:27:56.520 --> 03:28:01.080]  staunch Christians are totally against that and understand that as well, but at the same time
[03:28:01.080 --> 03:28:07.960]  in Christianity, we respect everything. It's just suddenly hit me. I won't go into the details as to
[03:28:07.960 --> 03:28:15.560]  why. Just in time for what was called the Mayan shift, I was reawakened to something that I
[03:28:15.560 --> 03:28:20.520]  realised was going to happen 20 odd years ago. By somebody, it was like somebody suddenly turning
[03:28:20.520 --> 03:28:30.680]  on a light and what Alex is doing, his energy, his message for people is just so fantastic. Now
[03:28:30.680 --> 03:28:40.120]  he's done this. People are going to be aware that they're all being listened to. Just an interesting
[03:28:40.120 --> 03:28:44.440]  point. I don't want this to get boring because I've made my girlfriend absolutely sick and tired
[03:28:44.440 --> 03:28:53.000]  and unfortunately she introduced what's going on and on about all this. I'm in Hartford,
[03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:57.000]  which is the county town of Hartfordshire. You have a Hartford in the States which is named after
[03:28:57.000 --> 03:29:04.680]  this town. It's near Hartford and I'm hoping to catch up with Alex over the weekend. I've got
[03:29:04.680 --> 03:29:09.960]  my children coming down from Scotland. I hope he's popped down on Sunday. I think he's still going
[03:29:09.960 --> 03:29:17.160]  to be there. I had a conversation with an arms officer. As you know, we officially
[03:29:17.160 --> 03:29:23.720]  police don't carry guns. We're getting close to a break. Get us to the end of the story here
[03:29:23.720 --> 03:29:31.720]  quickly as you can. Yeah, okay. Well, my friend who has a child in the same school as my children
[03:29:31.720 --> 03:29:36.680]  used to go to, I said, have you heard about the secret meeting? This is about two weeks ago before
[03:29:36.680 --> 03:29:42.920]  I saw Alex in the coverage and he said, what do you know about it? And you know, this is a family
[03:29:42.920 --> 03:29:47.800]  man, a nice man. His wife goes to the same church as I do. All right, hang on. We'll be right back
[03:29:47.800 --> 03:29:53.160]  to get the rest of that right after the break. Stay tuned. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.160 --> 03:30:05.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the info wars.com team

[03:33:19.160 --> 03:33:24.760]  callers and we're gonna have some Alex interviews coming up we were just talking to Gordon from
[03:33:24.760 --> 03:33:29.000]  London and he was right at a cliffhanger when we had to go to break and I wanted to hear the end of
[03:33:29.000 --> 03:33:34.280]  that story Gordon you're still there? Yes David. Could you tell us real quickly you were telling us
[03:33:34.280 --> 03:33:39.000]  that you had somebody that you talked to that didn't know anything about the Bilderberg meeting
[03:33:39.880 --> 03:33:43.560]  go ahead and get to get that point quickly I've got some other people on the line but I'd like
[03:33:43.560 --> 03:33:49.800]  to hear how that ends. A chair constabulary who are the security for all this I thought okay well
[03:33:49.800 --> 03:33:56.280]  I'll check him out because you know I don't believe in hiding things whereas you know I knew that I
[03:33:56.280 --> 03:34:01.000]  was possibly putting myself in a difficult situation for him but I said have you heard about
[03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:06.600]  this secret society meeting are you working over the weekend he said no what are you talking about
[03:34:06.600 --> 03:34:12.440]  and so of course I went to it and he said it is not secret I said yeah well yeah but it has been
[03:34:12.440 --> 03:34:17.800]  hidden and he said yeah but you know about it I know about it so obviously the whole of the
[03:34:17.800 --> 03:34:24.360]  whole of the chair constabulary had been briefed about it but therefore the more these people
[03:34:24.360 --> 03:34:29.800]  have to try and protect themselves the more it's infiltrating out into the general man
[03:34:29.800 --> 03:34:36.440]  you have a common man and woman and child and I've seen Alex sort of you know being by the
[03:34:36.440 --> 03:34:41.240]  police people asking the police questions and my point is that you know we've really got to get
[03:34:41.240 --> 03:34:48.280]  on board with this has faith um Alex is just leading he's leading uh an amazing opportunity
[03:34:48.280 --> 03:34:53.480]  for us to do this but it needs to be done obviously peacefully we don't want anybody thinking you know
[03:34:53.480 --> 03:34:58.360]  we don't want the civil war we don't want people overthrowing with violence or anything like that
[03:34:58.360 --> 03:35:02.760]  because that's just replacing the same with the same and then fate and gets in there and it starts
[03:35:02.760 --> 03:35:08.040]  over again so well violence violence is their technique they're the ones who have the assassination
[03:35:08.040 --> 03:35:11.880]  kill list they're the ones who fire missiles at people from the air they're the ones who kill
[03:35:11.880 --> 03:35:17.800]  thousands of people the ones who have the secret bombings of Cambodia that's their tactic what we're
[03:35:17.800 --> 03:35:21.880]  trying to do is fight them with the truth we're trying to shine the light on them that's what
[03:35:21.880 --> 03:35:27.880]  Alex has done he's forcing these cockroaches out into the open the uh they can no longer
[03:35:27.880 --> 03:35:33.960]  credibly deny that this meeting exists up until just a couple of years ago that was their strategy
[03:35:33.960 --> 03:35:38.920]  as uh glenn greenwall talked about when he first covered it in 2009 they were being chased around
[03:35:38.920 --> 03:35:45.240]  spain by security services that just doesn't work anymore but they are still hiding their agenda
[03:35:45.240 --> 03:35:49.160]  they're still trying to pretend that this is something that is not important and yet we have
[03:35:49.160 --> 03:35:54.040]  prime ministers chancellors of the exchequer taking time out of their calendar for two days
[03:35:54.040 --> 03:35:59.640]  going there and meeting and not having any transparency any disclosure about what is being
[03:35:59.640 --> 03:36:05.720]  covered there that is absolutely criminal it invites corruption it breeds corruption we've
[03:36:05.720 --> 03:36:12.760]  seen it we know that happens let's uh go to rod and france roddy there can you hear me david
[03:36:12.760 --> 03:36:19.160]  yes i can okay really good to get to talk to you i tried to get in yesterday uh to make some
[03:36:19.160 --> 03:36:24.920]  comments um on some points that you brought up about whistleblowers um how it's so important
[03:36:24.920 --> 03:36:32.920]  uh that uh you know that these people come out in the open and as alex said today on the show i
[03:36:32.920 --> 03:36:38.520]  think it's really important that uh that we really try to stand behind these people um because
[03:36:39.160 --> 03:36:43.400]  you know they're they're coming out and and you know telling us the truth and telling us
[03:36:43.400 --> 03:36:49.160]  telling us the things that are going on and they're putting themselves at risk and i really feel
[03:36:49.160 --> 03:36:55.560]  like they they need our support and a second thing i'd like to say while i've got you on the line is
[03:36:55.560 --> 03:37:03.000]  you were speaking about a petition you know to to get obama to resign is it possible like it like
[03:37:03.000 --> 03:37:09.240]  in colorado with the uh with the recall vote that they're that they're doing in colorado would it be
[03:37:09.240 --> 03:37:16.760]  possible to go state by state and get actually all the states to uh to get seven thousand signatures
[03:37:16.760 --> 03:37:21.160]  or i don't know if it's per capita or how that works but i really don't know what the legal
[03:37:21.160 --> 03:37:26.040]  i don't know what the legal process is i believe that impeachment needs to start in the house it may
[03:37:26.040 --> 03:37:30.120]  be done and completely in the house i really haven't haven't looked at that but i'm hoping
[03:37:30.120 --> 03:37:34.360]  that someone will do something about that we had an article what you were just talking about
[03:37:34.360 --> 03:37:38.840]  in the atlantic by connor freederstorf said the unknown patriot who exposed the government's
[03:37:38.840 --> 03:37:43.720]  barrison spy program and he says in it why did he do it it's impossible to know but it isn't hard
[03:37:43.720 --> 03:37:48.760]  to identify likely motives perhaps the leaker felt morally repulsed by the knowledge that the
[03:37:48.760 --> 03:37:54.200]  government is spying on millions of innocent citizens in secret something normally associated
[03:37:54.200 --> 03:37:59.960]  with communist and fascist regimes not with democratic republics well that is the direction
[03:37:59.960 --> 03:38:07.160]  that we are headed into fascism and uh we should all be repulsed by this we should all think the
[03:38:07.160 --> 03:38:13.720]  person who leaked this and uh we i think it puts wiki leaks it puts what's going on with bradley
[03:38:13.720 --> 03:38:18.600]  manning an entirely different perspective doesn't it and we need to think about that we need to be
[03:38:18.600 --> 03:38:24.760]  grateful to people who when they see the government breaking its own laws laws which as i said before
[03:38:25.400 --> 03:38:31.480]  fly in the face of the constitution and even those new unconstitutional laws are not enough
[03:38:31.480 --> 03:38:35.400]  of a restriction for these people we need to get together we need to do something and we need to
[03:38:35.400 --> 03:38:42.040]  demand that congressmen whether they're opposition congressmen or whether you get people like ron
[03:38:42.040 --> 03:38:46.200]  widen and rand paul can get together on civil liberties issues like this there are people in
[03:38:46.200 --> 03:38:51.240]  the house where this needs to start that can come together on this and we need to say to our
[03:38:51.240 --> 03:38:56.920]  congressional representatives if you do not impeach somebody who has done something like this like
[03:38:56.920 --> 03:39:03.560]  obama you are part of the problem you are enabling them you are tacitly approving of what they're
[03:39:03.560 --> 03:39:09.000]  doing by your inaction and by your silence you need to do something congressmen whether you're
[03:39:09.000 --> 03:39:14.520]  republican or democrat it was republicans getting behind the impeachment of richard nixon that made
[03:39:14.520 --> 03:39:20.360]  him resign and they stayed on the wrong side of that argument for far too long and we got a lot
[03:39:20.360 --> 03:39:24.360]  of democrats who are on the wrong side of this argument for far too long on this right now now
[03:39:24.360 --> 03:39:28.840]  of course obama if he gets out it's going to be replaced by somebody who probably has a lot of
[03:39:28.840 --> 03:39:34.280]  his same agenda but it is important that people understand it's important that the next person
[03:39:34.280 --> 03:39:39.800]  that comes into power understands that the people are not going to tolerate this that congress is
[03:39:39.800 --> 03:39:44.760]  not going to tolerate this kind of blanket repudiation of the constitution they swore to
[03:39:44.760 --> 03:39:49.800]  appealed we need to make sure they're going to understand that and that they are chastened by
[03:39:49.800 --> 03:39:54.520]  that that's why we need to get obama out even if we put somebody in that's going to be as bad or
[03:39:54.520 --> 03:39:59.800]  worse than obama we've got to take action we cannot allow this to continue let's go to our next

[03:41:04.360 --> 03:41:11.000]  big names uh chris christ is going to be there uh it's where it's been reported ran paul uh was

[03:41:34.920 --> 03:41:42.680]  attend it's five thousand dollars a plate that goes to mit son tags uh uh hedge fund group
[03:41:44.680 --> 03:41:49.080]  again it's called the it's called the experts and enthusiast conference i called i called during
[03:41:49.080 --> 03:41:56.440]  the week uh mentioning about uh tweeting jake tapper to try to get him to cover bill de berg
[03:41:56.440 --> 03:42:04.040]  and and i was i was shocked to see yesterday watching jake tapper show the lead on cnn towards
[03:42:04.040 --> 03:42:10.120]  the end of his show he spent a whole segment on bill de berg he had a news package talking about
[03:42:10.120 --> 03:42:15.880]  they can no longer they can no longer ignore it uh they look foolish and stupid if they do but what
[03:42:15.880 --> 03:42:20.200]  they're trying to do is they're trying to spend it and he did uh cover even covered alex jones he
[03:42:20.200 --> 03:42:26.040]  had some of the uh great b-roll graphics up there that uh darin mcbrane did and um they maybe john
[03:42:26.040 --> 03:42:30.840]  bound might have contributed some of that stuff to it but you know they they talk about alex they
[03:42:30.840 --> 03:42:34.520]  take some of his comments out of context they put something in there about jessie ventura
[03:42:34.520 --> 03:42:38.280]  saying they're trying to kill me and it's like yeah of course the government would never try to do
[03:42:38.280 --> 03:42:43.800]  anything like that i'm sure that jessie ventura wouldn't be on a hit list from obama's drones
[03:42:43.800 --> 03:42:50.120]  nothing like that but um they try to make them look ridiculous they try to make pretend that
[03:42:51.080 --> 03:42:57.320]  that bill de berg doesn't mean anything now that they can't deny that it exists let's go to this
[03:42:57.320 --> 03:43:02.520]  interview that we've got here that the huffington post had with alex jones and he's talking about
[03:43:02.520 --> 03:43:09.080]  how the secrecy of bill de berg has now been exposed so i talked to like two hundred people
[03:43:09.080 --> 03:43:14.360]  on all these questions i think i'm going to start over alex and we heard that david camera is actually
[03:43:14.360 --> 03:43:17.560]  going to attend this meeting today i'm just surprised it's going down and is there an obvious
[03:43:17.560 --> 03:43:22.760]  conflict of interest there well i kind of halfway expected something like this to happen because
[03:43:22.760 --> 03:43:28.040]  they've gone from being secret uh and saying anybody that talks about it as a cougar conspiracy
[03:43:28.040 --> 03:43:33.240]  terrorist so now okay we're real but we're just a little political chat and so they want to hide
[03:43:33.240 --> 03:43:37.240]  in plain view and have david camera and come here and who knows sarcosi may come here the lord is
[03:43:37.240 --> 03:43:42.840]  real gates he's going to be sneaking in a lot of times there's 20 30 to 50 people who aren't on the
[03:43:42.840 --> 03:43:46.760]  list and those are using the real conflict of interest and that's who they'll have to sneak in
[03:43:46.760 --> 03:43:52.360]  or land behind fences and helicopters now but the fact that camera is openly announcing as the
[03:43:52.360 --> 03:43:57.080]  head of a major state that he's going to be attending in the middle of it i think this is
[03:43:57.080 --> 03:44:01.640]  this is bill de berg pretty much going public and that's actually what i was told for my senate
[03:44:01.640 --> 03:44:07.000]  sources and what i was told by a major hollywood source to remember the bill de berg group uh
[03:44:07.000 --> 03:44:13.080]  that that they are having a major debate about uh just opening up their entire operation to the
[03:44:13.080 --> 03:44:18.600]  press or at least the speeches they give that are davos life but it's the break off groups
[03:44:18.600 --> 03:44:23.720]  where the real collusion goes on the price fixing i mean they've been in defense before
[03:44:23.720 --> 03:44:29.960]  there've been investigations uh back in the 70s with lockheed and fritz Bernhardt and jet deals
[03:44:29.960 --> 03:44:35.080]  with the Netherlands so that's the problem that's going on here and uh we've just been trying on
[03:44:35.080 --> 03:44:41.240]  myself for 18 years to get the public to understand there are these five super high-level
[03:44:41.240 --> 03:44:46.600]  power broker meetings going on it was westbrook peddler back in the 50s to have to be on vacation
[03:44:46.600 --> 03:44:52.280]  and see a hotel walk down and people knew famous people world leaders there and he was a syndicate
[03:44:52.280 --> 03:44:55.720]  of columnists and wrote about it and they said shut up and he said shut up what what there's
[03:44:55.720 --> 03:45:00.120]  something above government and then it just grew from there we didn't even know the name of it till
[03:45:00.120 --> 03:45:05.720]  about 35 years ago do you think that the holiday is going public now it feels like it's been going
[03:45:05.720 --> 03:45:11.400]  on this time will the influence of the bill de berg will wane do you think so i think that the
[03:45:11.400 --> 03:45:17.320]  influence of the bill de berg group has waned uh because of exposure but but it's it's waned even
[03:45:17.320 --> 03:45:24.680]  more in just the last few years now it's completely evident today because of the fact that the founding
[03:45:24.680 --> 03:45:29.800]  members have have died like prince Bernhardt or their soul like henry kissinger and david rockfeller
[03:45:29.800 --> 03:45:34.600]  but what we're really seeing is more than a death we're seeing a passing of the torch to what i call
[03:45:34.600 --> 03:45:38.520]  googleberg and we have insiders on that that's what really freaked them out while they threw us out
[03:45:38.520 --> 03:45:43.880]  days before he started we have sources uh in government but also confirmed for people that
[03:45:43.880 --> 03:45:48.840]  were in the hotel that work there that indeed google is basically organizing and running and all
[03:45:48.840 --> 03:45:54.680]  and uses this kind of as a command base on a routine basis this is a google command base so
[03:45:54.680 --> 03:46:00.280]  google brags they planned and launched the herb spring here and so it's google google is merging
[03:46:00.280 --> 03:46:05.480]  with bill de berg and facebook is merging with bill de berg and the torch is being passed really
[03:46:05.480 --> 03:46:10.840]  this year that's why queen betricks uh is you know now stepping down her son's gonna become the king
[03:46:12.680 --> 03:46:18.600]  in total towards the torch passage is going on right now inside and this is a big victory for
[03:46:18.600 --> 03:46:24.680]  those of us that pointed out the obvious there are powerful corporate groups above government
[03:46:24.680 --> 03:46:30.600]  manipulating things they're the ones that set up the EU a lot of their minutes have leaked documents
[03:46:30.600 --> 03:46:36.520]  have been stolen they've confirmed their real wiki leaks they set a lot of policies they they steer
[03:46:36.520 --> 03:46:41.400]  much of our world and and the people that are attendees they steer other organizations that
[03:46:41.400 --> 03:46:47.240]  manage other areas but but this is right up at the top of the pyramid that's one of the oldest
[03:46:47.240 --> 03:46:52.840]  continued and most prestigious within the establishment uh meetings i mean if you get the
[03:46:52.840 --> 03:46:58.040]  bill de berg nod like bill clinton did in 1991 a little known governor you're going right at the top
[03:46:58.040 --> 03:47:03.160]  if you get the bill de berg nod like plenty blared in two years before uh he became prime minister
[03:47:03.800 --> 03:47:09.400]  they plan things two three four years out on the schemes and the programs and always right after
[03:47:09.400 --> 03:47:15.080]  bill de berg you then see their talking points being regurgitated at g8 g20 being pushed by the
[03:47:15.080 --> 03:47:19.400]  media outlets they own in control this is finally out if you're seeing more uh interest in this kind
[03:47:19.400 --> 03:47:24.200]  of thing uh from around the globe obviously very much interest on the u.s the global especially
[03:47:24.200 --> 03:47:27.800]  if you look at it are you seeing people come to your side you're getting messages around the world
[03:47:30.680 --> 03:47:35.320]  absolutely i mean our website info wars dot com is visited by people all over the planet the radio
[03:47:35.320 --> 03:47:40.600]  shows listen to by people all over the planet uh i've run into people on the streets of london
[03:47:42.040 --> 03:47:45.800]  when i'm just walking in the dark i hear my voice have come over of all race color screens
[03:47:46.760 --> 03:47:51.320]  i've gone out you know into some of the tourist areas run into people who live in london and
[03:47:51.320 --> 03:47:58.280]  have just been raised by people that are listeners over here so people are as awake in england to
[03:47:58.280 --> 03:48:04.600]  what's going on as they are in texas where i live and so i think it's a populism that transcends
[03:48:04.600 --> 03:48:10.680]  left and right as people begin to try to figure out exactly who the special interest are but always
[03:48:10.680 --> 03:48:17.240]  get the front seats who always get first dibs at the table who get bailed out for trillions of dollars
[03:48:17.240 --> 03:48:21.080]  i mean that's what's going on in their tax avoidance for the ultra rich
[03:48:22.920 --> 03:48:27.560]  setting agendas price fixing they've been caught before and that's why they always
[03:48:27.560 --> 03:48:31.880]  told the media just say we don't exist or you're fired i've talked to national press people just
[03:48:31.880 --> 03:48:37.960]  this year who were told do not go cover bill deberg i've talked to national press profilers in the
[03:48:37.960 --> 03:48:42.200]  united states who were said of course i can do whatever i want i'll be allowed to go to england
[03:48:42.200 --> 03:48:48.680]  to cover you famous reporters and then they're told no they told me you know don't go and by the way
[03:48:48.680 --> 03:48:54.440]  don't mention bill deberg your piece so that's the type of stuff that's going on i talked to five
[03:48:54.440 --> 03:49:00.040]  different national media outlets who are doing profiles on me and several of them asked to come
[03:49:00.040 --> 03:49:04.360]  here and we're told they couldn't and and one of them told me off record oh you're right well i'm
[03:49:04.360 --> 03:49:08.520]  blown away they said don't even mention that and then they asked the editor of the major magazine
[03:49:08.520 --> 03:49:13.160]  why they said just we'll keep the job just just don't get into it because in the united states
[03:49:14.360 --> 03:49:21.640]  it's finally been in the having a post it's finally been in the cnbc covered it i mean just four years
[03:49:21.640 --> 03:49:27.320]  ago the new york times did an article a film review of a film called new world order with a
[03:49:27.320 --> 03:49:34.600]  film crew that was there just covering the public helicopters armored limousine cutting in secret
[03:49:34.600 --> 03:49:40.840]  service of mp5's aiming at us i mean it was a circus and the new york times says jones was
[03:49:41.400 --> 03:49:47.880]  in a marriott uh you know field imagining all this that i mean wow i mean no wonder circulation
[03:49:47.880 --> 03:49:52.920]  of those established republicans is down because everybody online saw the video they knew it was
[03:49:52.920 --> 03:49:57.320]  real and happening i mean imagine the new york times because the new york times today say jones
[03:49:57.320 --> 03:50:01.800]  was in anyone imagining stuff probably will and they've got a certain audience that they could
[03:50:01.800 --> 03:50:05.720]  tell anything they want to i mean it's just it doesn't mean i have all the answers either about
[03:50:05.720 --> 03:50:09.800]  what's going on it doesn't mean everybody in there's you know openly evil or consciously evil it just
[03:50:09.800 --> 03:50:14.600]  means that there is power structures that are always trying to manipulate our our countries and
[03:50:14.600 --> 03:50:19.320]  they don't want us to even know that's happening well that's alex jones talking to the huffington post

[03:54:07.080 --> 03:54:11.080]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in for alex jones we just had
[03:54:11.080 --> 03:54:16.200]  a report that three people have been reported wounded in san amonica california uh if there's
[03:54:16.200 --> 03:54:20.760]  any news updates on that we'll be following it on the nightly news tonight rob do will be hosting
[03:54:21.400 --> 03:54:27.080]  now stop and think for a moment though without without being insensitive without it's a tragedy
[03:54:27.080 --> 03:54:31.080]  when anything like this happens but if this is an automobile accident where there were three
[03:54:31.080 --> 03:54:36.520]  people injured in an automobile accident in san amonica california would that be national news
[03:54:36.520 --> 03:54:42.440]  just stop and think about the fact why is that even national news we just had a building collapse
[03:54:42.440 --> 03:54:48.200]  in philadelphia that injured two people and kill and i'm sorry kill two people and injured quite a
[03:54:48.200 --> 03:54:54.680]  few others about the same number of casualties that happened at the boston bombing and look
[03:54:54.680 --> 03:55:00.600]  at the way things are spun differently when we see this happen with the building collapse in philadelphia
[03:55:01.160 --> 03:55:08.040]  everybody is touched by the tragedy of it but there's not calls to outlaw buildings or whatever
[03:55:08.040 --> 03:55:13.560]  but it's it's that's what you always see whenever it's something that they can use to forward their
[03:55:13.560 --> 03:55:19.160]  agenda of the police state they will use it and they will publicize it so we hope that there are
[03:55:19.160 --> 03:55:24.760]  no deaths there we uh our thoughts and prayers with those people who've been injured in california
[03:55:24.760 --> 03:55:29.880]  and we'll see what comes of that as we move along but right now let's move to a call we've got a
[03:55:29.880 --> 03:55:36.760]  caller in richard in texas richard are you there yeah i'll be real quick i wanted to share a story
[03:55:36.760 --> 03:55:41.480]  with you since you're talking about the builder birds and police states i moved uh Beverly Hills
[03:55:41.480 --> 03:55:47.320]  california los angeles california back in 81 and i took a bike messenger job up in Beverly Hills
[03:55:47.320 --> 03:55:53.080]  because my brother had been picked up for a parking in front of employment which was western union
[03:55:53.080 --> 03:55:59.640]  at the time they threw him in prison went in jail first in prison later and he had to pay some parking
[03:55:59.640 --> 03:56:04.600]  tickets so they needed a new guy to fuel his position so i became the bike messenger now my
[03:56:04.600 --> 03:56:11.320]  first day on the job i completed the day i got lost a lot delivering the mail so i finally completed
[03:56:11.320 --> 03:56:15.880]  the day it happened to be 104 degrees that day too and i'm right up and down Beverly Hills trying to
[03:56:15.880 --> 03:56:22.440]  deliver high dollar western union uh 100 grams so at the last minute before i was getting off at
[03:56:22.440 --> 03:56:28.760]  about four o'clock all of a sudden about i don't know how many units came they encircled me they
[03:56:29.480 --> 03:56:33.640]  hit me up against the building right there on wilson boulevard the richest street in the world
[03:56:33.640 --> 03:56:38.680]  they say they put a hundred guns in my head literally it was like your sepidies fam or
[03:56:38.680 --> 03:56:44.120]  somebody drawn down on me and uh i i try to be real quick i know you got to get off but
[03:56:44.120 --> 03:56:49.000]  they they eventually arrested me after leaving me in the sun for about an hour to sweat out
[03:56:49.000 --> 03:56:55.240]  two old uh uh citizens came by and pointed the finger at me i was allegedly the one
[03:56:55.240 --> 03:57:00.440]  beat them up in Beverly Hills took their gold and i'm still stupid enough to be riding around
[03:57:00.440 --> 03:57:06.440]  delivering uh high dollar uh western union uh money grams but they took me in jail that night
[03:57:06.440 --> 03:57:11.560]  they kept me all night i didn't get to make a phone call to my new employer then i found out
[03:57:11.560 --> 03:57:16.360]  that everybody else that was in jail that day were actually being held over so they could
[03:57:16.360 --> 03:57:20.760]  have their identities checked because this was before the computers now the point i'm making
[03:57:20.760 --> 03:57:27.480]  Beverly Hills is like a small bastion for the behemian grove new world order types and i'm sure
[03:57:27.480 --> 03:57:32.680]  you know that so if you and alex jones and the rest of us don't defeat these criminals
[03:57:32.680 --> 03:57:37.960]  they'll turn the entire american police force into the bevel Beverly Hills police force oh yeah
[03:57:37.960 --> 03:57:43.480]  now the doctor oh yeah the doctor who released me with said detainment they didn't say they
[03:57:43.480 --> 03:57:49.000]  arrested me yeah right who's on my head and let me off the next day well richard they just
[03:57:49.000 --> 03:57:53.880]  richard they just passed a the senate just passed a law but it hasn't it's still got to go through
[03:57:53.880 --> 03:57:58.680]  the other house and be signed but in new york they just passed a law saying that it's going to be a
[03:57:58.680 --> 03:58:04.520]  felony to annoy a policeman you know you can't annoy your masters i think what needs to happen
[03:58:04.520 --> 03:58:09.880]  is i think they need to take new york and they need to take california let them secede from the union
[03:58:09.880 --> 03:58:13.720]  and maybe they can do something kind of like they had east and west pakistan and leave the rest of us
[03:58:13.720 --> 03:58:20.440]  alone to uh to go our own way but it's getting really bad with uh new york and with california
[03:58:20.440 --> 03:58:24.360]  especially but it's a template and we see that they're just not respecting individual rights
[03:58:24.360 --> 03:58:39.800]  anymore well that's it for tonight tune into the nightly news with rob do tonight
