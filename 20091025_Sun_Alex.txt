[00:55.200 --> 01:00.120]  available at info wars.com Gerald Salente it is great to have you here I
[01:00.120 --> 01:03.760]  want to talk about the dollar I want to get into what's happening with gold I
[01:03.760 --> 01:09.160]  want to get into what's happening with the police and the government trying like
[01:09.160 --> 01:12.760]  you said years ago to raise all these taxes in the middle of a depression the
[01:12.760 --> 01:16.760]  media lying saying we're in a jobless recovery I remember you a year ago on
[01:16.760 --> 01:20.920]  this show saying they would call it a jobless recovery and I guess they stole
[01:20.920 --> 01:24.800]  your term because that's what they're saying we're gonna discuss it all today
[01:24.800 --> 01:28.720]  but what's most important on Gerald Salente's plate what do you want to talk
[01:28.720 --> 01:35.440]  about out of the gates well I first I'd like to talk about your new DVD and the
[01:35.440 --> 01:41.800]  impact that you're making all over the world as being a leader in the second
[01:41.800 --> 01:48.400]  American Revolution because the second American Revolution has begun and it
[01:48.400 --> 01:55.400]  began with the Tea Parties and the tax process in April 15th it accelerated with
[01:55.400 --> 02:01.720]  the rallies and protests on the 4th of July with people screaming for taxation
[02:01.720 --> 02:08.600]  without representation or against it I should say and also it hit another new
[02:08.600 --> 02:13.600]  high with all of these town hall meetings when people came out it was more
[02:13.600 --> 02:20.480]  about again big government than the health care program and then we saw the
[02:20.480 --> 02:27.480]  rally on against big government on September 12th in Washington when
[02:27.480 --> 02:31.320]  nearly a million people according to whose report you believe and we don't
[02:31.320 --> 02:35.720]  know what to believe but there are a lot of people and so really the second
[02:35.720 --> 02:41.720]  American Revolution has begun and you're a prominent voice in it and I'm
[02:41.720 --> 02:47.800]  thrilled to also be a part of it because the direction we're going in now is
[02:47.800 --> 02:54.920]  leading the country down a path and their people are calling it socialism and
[02:54.920 --> 03:00.080]  we're making it clear that this isn't socialism the merger of state and
[03:00.080 --> 03:07.200]  corporate powers is clearly as Mussolini said fascism and fascism has come to
[03:07.200 --> 03:13.840]  America this whole myth of the two big to fails who made this story up and the
[03:13.840 --> 03:19.160]  banks gaining more and more control buying out all the weaker financial
[03:19.160 --> 03:26.160]  institutions bringing their their strength together as oligopolies to
[03:26.160 --> 03:31.320]  take over this nation and we're just seeing more and more of it but the
[03:31.320 --> 03:35.800]  whole world also is seeing what's going on as you're talking about with the
[03:35.800 --> 03:41.520]  decline of the dollar and people should be very aware of this because we're
[03:41.520 --> 03:46.720]  very concerned that they're going to call a bank holiday as things get worse
[03:46.720 --> 03:51.720]  you see the dollar now is it a dollar fifty against the euro you know they're
[03:51.720 --> 03:56.400]  talking about alex how the dow at ten thousand how people are oh how
[03:56.400 --> 04:01.200]  wonderful it is doubt ten thousand well the doubt first at ten thousand ten
[04:01.200 --> 04:06.080]  years ago you know the unemployment rate the official unemployment rate was
[04:06.080 --> 04:11.200]  about four point two percent now the official unemployment rate is what nine
[04:11.200 --> 04:15.760]  point eight percent and you saw the numbers came out today again about five
[04:15.760 --> 04:21.880]  hundred what thirty thousand people on on unemployment and then and then that
[04:21.880 --> 04:27.860]  the the the barrel of oil back then ten years ago was selling for under
[04:27.860 --> 04:31.200]  sixteen dollars a barrel what's it selling for now
[04:31.200 --> 04:37.840]  eighty dollars it devaluing the dollar they're going to make us all poorer
[04:37.840 --> 04:42.120]  absolutely I want to talk about where you see the revolution going because I
[04:42.120 --> 04:44.800]  remember several years ago you you predicted we were going to have the
[04:44.800 --> 04:49.320]  crash they were going to raise taxes in the midst of it people would start
[04:49.320 --> 04:53.520]  demonstrating the government will ignore that and then it will then build you
[04:53.520 --> 04:57.280]  ahead we're going to talk about a lot of issues with your own salinity when we
[04:57.280 --> 05:02.440]  come right back stay with us hello this is alex jones with some important

[06:00.160 --> 06:12.640]  ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the GCN radio network
[06:12.640 --> 06:17.800]  Gerald Salente top trans forecaster in the country has made hundreds of spot-on
[06:17.800 --> 06:23.440]  predictions more than two years ago charted exactly what was going to happen
[06:23.440 --> 06:28.480]  with the economy the bank implosions the consolidation of power the looting the
[06:28.480 --> 06:33.080]  unfolding police state and the building revolution the establishment knows
[06:33.080 --> 06:35.200]  they've got a revolution on their hands that's why they're saying they're going
[06:35.200 --> 06:41.040]  to deploy 379,000 homeland security troops from the army and Marine Corps and
[06:41.040 --> 06:45.280]  Air Force in the United States in the next two years they're suddenly popping
[06:45.280 --> 06:48.720]  up everywhere conditioning the public they're openly announcing bank of the
[06:48.720 --> 06:53.040]  world global carbon taxes states and cities and counties and the feds are
[06:53.040 --> 06:58.320]  passing all these new taxes Obama has been breaking every promise all of this
[06:58.320 --> 07:04.440]  is coming to a head you predicted the tea parties you you called them taxpayer
[07:04.440 --> 07:10.280]  bush brush fire rebellions were some of the terms you used you said two years
[07:10.280 --> 07:13.440]  ago when I was reading what you were when we first started getting you on that
[07:13.440 --> 07:20.760]  that those would be ignored and that by 2012 everything would melt down expand
[07:20.760 --> 07:25.880]  now we're now two years later your forecast unfortunately is about 99%
[07:25.880 --> 07:30.640]  accurate even better than my 95% accuracy and I really do chart my accuracy
[07:30.640 --> 07:36.320]  let us into your brain Gerald Salente what's happening next is what we're
[07:36.320 --> 07:40.880]  concerned about next we as you know we just published the the autumn trends
[07:40.880 --> 07:46.600]  journal and now we're working on the top trends for 2010 but we're most concerned
[07:46.600 --> 07:56.360]  about Alex is what we're calling terror 2010 we're forecasting that there is a
[07:56.360 --> 08:03.000]  very high probability of a major terror strike against the United States Gerald
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.080]  let me interrupt you also predicted 9-11 so people better pay attention to what
[08:08.080 --> 08:15.600]  you're saying actually they can go they could Google my name Salente USA today
[08:15.600 --> 08:24.360]  December 14th 2000 and the headline read 2001 won't be our year trend seer says
[08:24.360 --> 08:30.480]  we said that Americans wouldn't be safe at home or abroad in 2001 and right now
[08:30.480 --> 08:37.920]  what's going on now is that Pakistan has launched a major major offensive in
[08:37.920 --> 08:45.480]  South Waziristan a couple of months ago they were in the Swat Valley and every
[08:45.480 --> 08:50.240]  time that the Pakistani army in Pakistan has to be one of the most corrupt
[08:50.240 --> 08:55.920]  nations on earth and they're being funded of course by the United States the
[08:55.920 --> 09:04.120]  the president Zidari he was called Mr. 10% he was the the husband of Boutto who
[09:04.120 --> 09:10.200]  was assassinated they call him Mr. 10% because he took 10% of all the action
[09:10.200 --> 09:15.400]  that went on in the government he's now the president and what's going on
[09:15.400 --> 09:20.640]  is that the anti-Americanism sweeping through Pakistan I mentioned the Swat
[09:20.640 --> 09:30.080]  Valley it was it was the biggest amount of people displaced since Rwanda just a
[09:30.080 --> 09:35.000]  month ago with 3 million refugees and now the same thing is happening once
[09:35.000 --> 09:42.200]  again in South Waziristan so the anti-Americanism sweeping through the
[09:42.200 --> 09:47.840]  Middle East is at an all-time high and now it's also of course going on in
[09:47.840 --> 09:54.560]  Iran again current events form future trends we just saw last Sunday that
[09:54.560 --> 09:59.800]  several Iranian and National Guard though the Republican Guard were
[09:59.800 --> 10:05.560]  killed in a suicide attempt that Iran is blaming on the United States and Israel
[10:05.560 --> 10:11.160]  so we're concerned that there's going to be a terror strike against the United
[10:11.160 --> 10:15.880]  States false flag are real we're saying something is going to happen very
[10:15.880 --> 10:22.360]  major in this field in 2010 so now we take it again as trend forecasters what
[10:22.360 --> 10:28.160]  does that mean good excuses to close the bank we're getting emails from all over
[10:28.160 --> 10:35.040]  the world Alex and and from top people that are seeing very clearly that the
[10:35.040 --> 10:40.200]  United States strategy is to devalue the dollar so that they pay back this
[10:40.200 --> 10:45.240]  massive loan with cheap money it's like you loaning me at a hundred dollars and
[10:45.240 --> 10:49.280]  then all of a sudden that hundred dollars only be worth it worthing being
[10:49.280 --> 10:54.120]  worth ten cents and I pay you back ten cents when you loaned it to me it was
[10:54.120 --> 10:59.120]  worth a hundred Bob and Gerald I want to stop you again and that's key what you
[10:59.120 --> 11:03.440]  just mentioned on the record the Bank of England the private Federal Reserve
[11:03.440 --> 11:07.440]  they're both partners as you know but for listeners that may not they are the
[11:07.440 --> 11:11.960]  ones openly killing the dollar bad mouthing it making all the decisions
[11:11.960 --> 11:17.040]  to kill it it's their G20 meeting and saying we need to phase it out devalue
[11:17.040 --> 11:22.480]  it go to SDRs as an above country currency bank to bank and then they'll
[11:22.480 --> 11:25.400]  control all the different currencies of the world so they can engage in more
[11:25.400 --> 11:29.640]  insider trading more consolidation of wealth criminally with their insider
[11:29.640 --> 11:34.640]  knowledge and control their regulatory control the the the made-off type Ken
[11:34.640 --> 11:39.440]  lay type criminals running the global regulatory system that is now already
[11:39.440 --> 11:44.680]  been built but now being unveiled they are killing it meanwhile our media tells
[11:44.680 --> 11:48.280]  us the Arabs are killing it when the Russians the Chinese the Arabs are
[11:48.280 --> 11:52.680]  saying we all hold trillions of your dollars why are you ripping us off why
[11:52.680 --> 11:57.120]  are you devaluing this when you asked us to buy it and and and the United
[11:57.120 --> 12:00.840]  States admits the last White House in the new and admits they're running
[12:00.840 --> 12:05.120]  Jundala that's blowing up military bases and police stations to get the
[12:05.120 --> 12:09.400]  Iranians to attack back they admit they're escalating the war in Pakistan
[12:09.400 --> 12:14.280]  and Afghanistan to elicit real resistance which they're then going to call
[12:14.280 --> 12:20.200]  terrorism used to launch a wider war and domestically cracked down on the
[12:20.200 --> 12:23.360]  population so for people to see an accurate map and tell me if you agree
[12:23.360 --> 12:27.320]  don't see the world as nations we now have these global corporations that
[12:27.320 --> 12:32.000]  control the UN and the central banks and they are playing nations and groups
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.600]  of off against each other to consolidate the power well said I agree with
[12:37.600 --> 12:43.200]  everything that you said and and that's precisely what's going on and what the
[12:43.200 --> 12:48.320]  American people have to understand is that as the dollar devalues and of
[12:48.320 --> 12:52.840]  course this trend has been going on for a long time as I mentioned when we they
[12:52.840 --> 12:57.240]  talk about doubt ten thousand when you went back to nineteen ninety nine since
[12:57.240 --> 13:03.000]  that time well that you could buy a euro for example for ninety five cents now
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.400]  it's going to cost you a dollar fifty and then back then you could buy an
[13:08.400 --> 13:13.040]  ounce of gold for two hundred eighty dollars you're saying the stock market's
[13:13.040 --> 13:16.120]  really down we're just buying it with the value dollars so it looks like it's
[13:16.120 --> 13:20.680]  more exactly an ounce of gold now of course course what the hundred one
[13:20.680 --> 13:24.440]  thousand sixty dollars yes with the people are doing with it is their
[13:24.440 --> 13:30.880]  lowering the standard of living for everyone the gap between the one
[13:30.880 --> 13:37.800]  percent owning more of assets has never been higher in in the 20th century then
[13:37.800 --> 13:44.960]  it is now so they're pushing everybody down into poverty as the money is going
[13:44.960 --> 13:50.480]  up to the top to the very few and about the jobless recovery that we
[13:50.480 --> 13:56.720]  talk about seventy two percent of our GDP is consumer based again we saw the
[13:56.720 --> 14:01.960]  numbers coming out today the unemployment rate continues to rise the
[14:01.960 --> 14:06.240]  amount of new people looking for unemployment a jobless recoveries but
[14:06.240 --> 14:12.400]  like being almost pregnant you can't it doesn't happen there's no such thing
[14:12.400 --> 14:17.080]  and when you go back to the glass depression you read the history of it
[14:17.080 --> 14:21.760]  they were doing the same kind of jive talk back then they would rush the
[14:21.760 --> 14:27.160]  market up the sucker the people into it the market would collapse and they would
[14:27.160 --> 14:31.360]  talk about it the recovery being just around and that yo-yo went on for three
[14:31.360 --> 14:35.960]  years until they admitted we were really in a big depression how long will the
[14:35.960 --> 14:42.880]  yo-yoing go in in in your opinion well it it will it will continue for it
[14:42.880 --> 14:49.320]  probably we think the real numbers are going to come out in in in December
[14:49.320 --> 14:55.080]  when this Christmas retail sales are a bust so when then went by the second
[14:55.080 --> 15:01.320]  quarter around March when reality hits February March as it did this year when
[15:01.320 --> 15:06.800]  the markets collapsed they can't hide it anymore but what happens is what we're
[15:06.800 --> 15:12.480]  concerned about again it's either false leg or real they're going to
[15:12.480 --> 15:18.840]  divert the people's attention and we're saying terror 2010 so they keep playing
[15:18.840 --> 15:24.720]  the yo-yo by throwing new games into the into the mix so they'll have the
[15:24.720 --> 15:29.800]  people's attention diverted look what happened people forget Alex that before
[15:29.800 --> 15:35.400]  9-11 how unpopular George Bush was and then they got this guy that couldn't
[15:35.400 --> 15:39.840]  fight his way out of a paper bag who's gonna tell everybody he's gonna hunt
[15:39.840 --> 15:45.080]  down Osama bin Laden dead or alive the whole nation followed him after 9-11
[15:45.080 --> 15:50.400]  the same kind of scenario could happen now stay there because I want to ask you
[15:50.400 --> 15:56.880]  next more police more tickets more fines more fees more taxes how do they squeeze
[15:56.880 --> 16:02.040]  more blood out of the population the illusion created by the power elite is
[16:02.040 --> 16:06.320]  a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat will you continue to be

[18:15.560 --> 18:19.440]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[18:19.440 --> 18:23.560]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[18:23.560 --> 18:27.880]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[18:27.880 --> 18:32.160]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every

[20:06.680 --> 20:13.920]  alex jones broadcasting network crashing through the lies and disinformation
[20:13.920 --> 20:19.000]  alex jones only on the gcm radio network
[20:20.600 --> 20:28.280]  gerald salante the republic is fading into history we've been fully conquered
[20:28.280 --> 20:33.080]  by offshore banks they in their own documents admit they create economic
[20:33.080 --> 20:36.680]  implosion so they can consolidate wealth they think their police state can
[20:36.680 --> 20:41.120]  protect them from the people so they can carry out this crime but you have said
[20:41.120 --> 20:45.240]  repeatedly and broken down the fact that that history shows it's not going to go
[20:45.240 --> 20:51.240]  that way break down in summary pleaser how you see this then unfolding in a
[20:51.240 --> 20:56.320]  chain of events what are the taxpayer revolts going to turn into as the system
[20:56.320 --> 21:01.680]  squeezes and squeezes and and squeezes well we already have state local
[21:01.680 --> 21:05.880]  governments over two hundred billion dollars in the red and they're going to
[21:05.880 --> 21:10.920]  keep asking people for more and more taxes right here in in Kingston New
[21:10.920 --> 21:15.120]  York where it just came out I don't know how true it is and not someone just call
[21:15.120 --> 21:21.040]  me today that they're going to look for in a 10% increase in taxes so we're
[21:21.040 --> 21:26.360]  we're organizing our own local tax revolts right here and this is going to
[21:26.360 --> 21:31.560]  go on all over the country as you know my saying as a Bronx boy when people lose
[21:31.560 --> 21:36.080]  everything and they have nothing left to lose they lose it and people are now
[21:36.080 --> 21:42.360]  looking at government as the enemy more so than ever before so the tax protests
[21:42.360 --> 21:48.800]  we see are going to be the catalyst that drives the nation into the second
[21:48.800 --> 21:54.880]  revolution we're in it already the media is denying it and as you know they're
[21:54.880 --> 22:01.080]  attributing these protests etc to right-wing fringe elements and and
[22:01.080 --> 22:05.640]  conservative nuts that's the way you know they like to paint it there's
[22:05.640 --> 22:08.800]  nothing to do with that these are people that have fed up and they have
[22:08.800 --> 22:13.800]  nothing to lose so we're going to see it manifest itself again with the tax
[22:13.800 --> 22:19.040]  revolts and then the winter comes and around much of the country people are
[22:19.040 --> 22:26.040]  going to be unable to afford to buy home heating fuel or gas they're not going
[22:26.040 --> 22:30.480]  to be you're going to start seeing particularly among the elderly now we
[22:30.480 --> 22:36.400]  have to understand why is why is oil prices that wire oil prices going up so
[22:36.400 --> 22:43.040]  high well it has less to do with demand and more to do going back again to the
[22:43.040 --> 22:48.680]  devaluation of the dollar oil as everyone knows is a petro dollars and
[22:48.680 --> 22:54.080]  with the dollar losing value oil prices keep going up so that's what we're
[22:54.080 --> 22:59.120]  going to see now I want to throw one other thing on here as well we saw
[22:59.120 --> 23:04.960]  Obama come out and tell the elderly that because of the cost of living index has
[23:04.960 --> 23:09.680]  gone down and remained flat that they're going to give them two hundred fifty
[23:09.680 --> 23:14.520]  dollars each to help them along well two hundred fifty dollars as we all know in
[23:14.520 --> 23:19.360]  the real world is chump change not worth anything it's going to cost the
[23:19.360 --> 23:23.720]  government about thirteen billion dollars aren't they generous with the
[23:23.720 --> 23:29.720]  elderly thirteen billion dollars is a we the people gave to the Goldman Sachs
[23:29.720 --> 23:36.720]  gang to cover their losses that they took on bed bets with AIG what I what an
[23:36.720 --> 23:42.880]  insult to the American people and this is where the the the inflammation is
[23:42.880 --> 23:48.080]  going to start rising it's going to be off with their heads before they know it
[23:48.080 --> 23:53.160]  they're so out of touch with what's going on in the street that they think they
[23:53.160 --> 23:58.800]  could chump the people with let them eat take two hundred and fifty dollar
[23:58.800 --> 24:05.040]  payoff so that's how we see this thing playing out we're going to see more and
[24:05.040 --> 24:10.480]  more people turning against the government and what we're hoping and
[24:10.480 --> 24:15.640]  not hoping what we're suggesting is that this that this revolution cannot be
[24:15.640 --> 24:23.880]  hijacked by by by violence because if it does we lose and all you have to see is
[24:23.880 --> 24:29.200]  what happened at the g-20 meetings when they call martial law again Pittsburgh
[24:29.200 --> 24:34.400]  I mean can you imagine closing down an entire city what hundred one point five
[24:34.400 --> 24:39.480]  million people for 20 world leaders and saying you can't come out on the street
[24:39.480 --> 24:43.880]  and then attacking peaceful people they're looking for trouble they're
[24:43.880 --> 24:48.400]  looking to set the precedent police dogs biting old women young girls getting
[24:48.400 --> 24:53.680]  billy clubbed off bikes they want violence Gerald how is the system going
[24:53.680 --> 24:59.000]  to keep the people from removing nafta and gat ending the open borders ending
[24:59.000 --> 25:02.480]  all the welfare for your legals how are they going to be able to continue the
[25:02.480 --> 25:07.280]  war when there's giant soup kitchens and long lines how are they going to be
[25:07.280 --> 25:11.360]  able to continue this well my answer is a control grid us news and world
[25:11.360 --> 25:15.800]  reporters announced that the police have kill switches and basically all the new
[25:15.800 --> 25:19.600]  cars through on star and other systems where they just turn your car off they
[25:19.600 --> 25:23.800]  always planned that I mean clearly they put this high-tech control grid in
[25:23.800 --> 25:27.920]  knowing they were going to bring in this tyranny later but still I think it's
[25:27.920 --> 25:31.280]  wishful thinking like you said desperate people do desperate things
[25:31.280 --> 25:35.480]  they're not going to be able to control what happens it's way beyond their
[25:35.480 --> 25:39.600]  control people should understand as they look around and they look at who these
[25:39.600 --> 25:44.480]  world leaders are or their own leaders and Nancy Pelosi the Bonnie Franks the
[25:44.480 --> 25:51.280]  the Bonners the Shelby's the the Dodds the Obama's the Geithner's the Summers
[25:51.280 --> 25:55.560]  and all those people you couldn't stand in high school that wanted to be the
[25:55.560 --> 26:00.400]  class president or that the student council in college or they think people
[26:00.400 --> 26:04.040]  who worked on the newspapers the people that you really you know that they
[26:04.040 --> 26:08.960]  always thought that they were better than you well guess what folks all those
[26:08.960 --> 26:12.520]  people you couldn't stand in high school those are the people that are
[26:12.520 --> 26:17.080]  telling you what to do right now and just as you looked at them they looked at
[26:17.080 --> 26:21.000]  them back in high school you you saw that there were a bunch of brown nosers
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.400]  and suck ups and they really didn't know much about anything other than having
[26:25.400 --> 26:29.640]  an attitude well that's who they are they still don't know much about anything
[26:29.640 --> 26:35.280]  they pretend to and they have this phalanx of guards around them and all of
[26:35.280 --> 26:39.600]  the all of the pomp and circumstances that pumps them up and of course you
[26:39.600 --> 26:43.360]  know they're living these privileged lives so they actually do think they're
[26:43.360 --> 26:47.600]  better than the rest of us and not going to be able to hold it together we're
[26:47.600 --> 26:51.440]  going to see also one of our forecasts is that we're going to see great
[26:51.440 --> 26:57.280]  successionist movements really take hold and we can actually see the breakup of
[26:57.280 --> 27:01.680]  the Republic just like we saw the breakup of the former Soviet Union we're
[27:01.680 --> 27:05.720]  going to talk about that more after we take calls but when I read about the
[27:05.720 --> 27:09.360]  psychology of Henry Kissinger and all these different globalists they
[27:09.360 --> 27:14.400]  themselves admit they love the guards they love the pomp they love the awards
[27:14.400 --> 27:18.920]  and I'm not saying I'm some perfect person but I can't stand pop I can't
[27:18.920 --> 27:24.040]  stand just fake praise but I guess for people like the Queen of England they
[27:24.040 --> 27:30.640]  love uniforms they love big golden crowns they love and and and they're smart
[27:30.640 --> 27:34.600]  at certain levels but another level they're dumb they do just paper over it
[27:34.600 --> 27:38.520]  with a police state and their lives but like you have been saying this isn't
[27:38.520 --> 27:42.440]  going to hold water no it's not you know and and again you know when you hear
[27:42.440 --> 27:47.760]  these politicians like like Al Gore or Hillary Clinton or Bush or I'm going to
[27:47.760 --> 27:52.000]  fight for you these people couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.680]  anybody that calls them their leaders needs to have their heads examined if
[27:56.680 --> 28:00.800]  people couldn't lead me across the street and I want to lead a country again
[28:00.800 --> 28:05.680]  it's all show it's the old bomber show we've never had a show like this one
[28:05.680 --> 28:11.320]  before he's on daytime TV late night TV he's at town all meetings he's on
[28:11.320 --> 28:17.280]  factory floors he's all over the place it's a show there's nothing behind it
[28:17.280 --> 28:23.280]  it's the Wizard of Oz and people are finding out that it's all hollow and
[28:23.280 --> 28:27.040]  that's why his approval ratings dropping like a rock I talked to Jesse
[28:27.040 --> 28:30.840]  Ventura last week it's a video we've got up on info wars dot com and prison
[28:30.840 --> 28:34.680]  bonnet dot com and he made the point that last year at the republican national
[28:34.680 --> 28:39.200]  convention it was an armed camp locked down much of the city they were acting
[28:39.200 --> 28:45.160]  like the public were all terrorist then it Ron Paul's event couple cops super
[28:45.160 --> 28:50.080]  light security everybody had a great time I mean Saddam Hussein would walk
[28:50.080 --> 28:55.400]  around in a group of 10,000 people with AK-47s but in America the foreign
[28:55.400 --> 28:58.240]  bankers come into town they lock the whole city down because they're the
[28:58.240 --> 29:04.040]  criminals hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century
[29:04.040 --> 29:08.800]  alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off
[29:08.800 --> 29:12.880]  this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[29:12.880 --> 29:18.040]  turning members influence on our president in Congress and they really
[29:18.040 --> 29:22.800]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[29:22.800 --> 29:27.160]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our
[29:27.160 --> 29:32.440]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[29:32.440 --> 29:36.760]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[29:36.760 --> 29:40.240]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[29:40.240 --> 29:45.480]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[33:46.200 --> 33:50.080]  parties off against each other when the republicans and democrats are equally
[33:50.080 --> 33:54.400]  part of the same wall street gang robbing us and we'll talk to Gerald Salente
[33:54.400 --> 33:59.320]  about that this film that has Jesse Ventura Gerald Salente Webster Tarpley

[34:28.400 --> 34:31.720]  they're planning to do in the future how they've committed crimes and how we
[34:31.720 --> 34:36.640]  either bring them to justice because they're criminals or we allow them to
[34:36.640 --> 34:41.000]  take their Ponzi scheme to the next level worldwide tyranny and then to the
[34:41.000 --> 34:45.240]  next scam the next the carbon tax the control the police state the citizen

[35:27.360 --> 35:33.360]  from 15% to 30% above loan sharking rates and I keep talking about the
[35:33.360 --> 35:38.080]  breaking point Gerald as the system squeezes and squeezes and squeezes and
[35:38.080 --> 35:41.400]  and they have announced in Austin they're gonna and the Travis County is
[35:41.400 --> 35:49.680]  gonna raise taxes on property taxes on septic tanks us taxes on on everything
[35:49.680 --> 35:55.560]  taxes on water taxes on trash doesn't the government understand that there
[35:55.560 --> 36:00.000]  just isn't more for them to steal I mean don't they understand they don't
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.960]  understand because of the life styles that they live look Alex the worst
[36:05.960 --> 36:10.920]  job I ever had in my life was when I was the assistant to the secretary of the
[36:10.920 --> 36:14.800]  New York State Senate I may have mentioned this on the yard be hanging
[36:14.800 --> 36:19.080]  around the back of the chamber with my pal and a senator would walk in and my
[36:19.080 --> 36:23.960]  buddy would leave me to go follow the senator like a little puppy dog to go
[36:23.960 --> 36:29.720]  pull out the chair to help him sit down these people live like royalty look at
[36:29.720 --> 36:34.320]  the look at the look at they fly around the world in their own planes that we
[36:34.320 --> 36:39.160]  the taxpayer pay for they're totally disconnected now they're giving the
[36:39.160 --> 36:42.480]  entire I'm sorry what no I'm interrupting now they're giving the
[36:42.480 --> 36:46.600]  entire House leadership and Senate leadership their own super luxury jets
[36:46.600 --> 36:53.360]  their own security you're I mean they're just absolutely out of control exactly
[36:53.360 --> 36:58.560]  they're totally disconnected just like they were when in France when it was
[36:58.560 --> 37:03.800]  off with their heads they don't understand what's going on with the
[37:03.800 --> 37:11.360]  average everyday working person who has a lousy job crummy pay lost benefits and
[37:11.360 --> 37:15.960]  don't even know if they're gonna get a job oh oh and here's one how about
[37:15.960 --> 37:22.160]  getting out of college and being what 30 40 50 60 thousand dollars in debt look
[37:22.160 --> 37:29.280]  we know Ivy League graduates at a law school that can't find jobs you think
[37:29.280 --> 37:34.880]  they're gonna be angry the revolution has begun as you pointed out they're
[37:34.880 --> 37:40.800]  squeezing the little people boy you you go through a red light but they got it
[37:40.800 --> 37:47.640]  on camera they got you everything you the septic tank taxes on and on and on
[37:47.640 --> 37:53.240]  toilet taxes we're gonna continue to see it is going to the revolution is
[37:53.240 --> 37:59.040]  happening and so now what we're also saying is that we're forecasting a
[37:59.040 --> 38:04.520]  third party by 2012 and we put recalling it for lack of another name
[38:04.520 --> 38:08.760]  progressive libertarian progressive in the things that you talk about with
[38:08.760 --> 38:14.920]  organic foods with a higher quality of life without buying junk libertarian in
[38:14.920 --> 38:20.800]  the truest sense you know they look this is classic empire decline could you
[38:20.800 --> 38:25.240]  imagine being involved in foreign entanglements costing us what is it
[38:25.240 --> 38:30.520]  causing eight billion dollars a month just to be in a rock and at a time when
[38:30.520 --> 38:34.840]  the Treasury is being depleted so we've got that's the new party that we're
[38:34.840 --> 38:40.280]  seeing forming and possibly someone like a Jesse Ventura or others could be
[38:40.280 --> 38:45.400]  leading this movement now now now Gerald in the time we have the I want to take
[38:45.400 --> 38:52.160]  some calls I want to expand on this there's dangers though the establishment
[38:52.160 --> 38:56.360]  generally when the banks loot a country they fund a communist or a fascist
[38:56.360 --> 39:00.560]  movement a fascist movement to consolidate control or a communist
[39:00.560 --> 39:05.440]  movement and we're in a fascist paradigm right now but I see through Obama or a
[39:05.440 --> 39:10.760]  future president that the establishment is attempting to sell socialism or
[39:10.760 --> 39:13.920]  communism but really that's just a way to consolidate the people's wealth and
[39:13.920 --> 39:18.880]  give it to offshore banks but selling to the little guy that oh yes like Michael
[39:18.880 --> 39:25.680]  Moore's new film capitalism did this and so the answer is Rob the rich put caps
[39:25.680 --> 39:29.520]  on what people can be paid but that won't be put on the big banks and the
[39:29.520 --> 39:33.480]  offshore corporations that's going to be put on local businesses and local
[39:33.480 --> 39:37.880]  companies and so kind of the howling mob of people that don't trust the
[39:37.880 --> 39:42.600]  government but they can be misdirected by the social engineers to then further
[39:42.600 --> 39:47.960]  Rob the hereditary enemy of the elite what's left of the middle class and so
[39:47.960 --> 39:51.720]  how do we navigate that because we know the social engineers have got a lot of
[39:51.720 --> 39:55.520]  tricks up their sleeves well it's going to be a difficult one and you really
[39:55.520 --> 40:00.440]  nailed it they're taxing that the the the American business people out of
[40:00.440 --> 40:05.080]  business they're giving the big tax breaks to the big guys and Michael Moore is
[40:05.080 --> 40:09.880]  wrong about capitalism is not the capitalism isn't dead capitalism
[40:09.880 --> 40:15.200]  didn't cause this problem it was caused by the criminal gangs the Wall Street
[40:15.200 --> 40:20.160]  mob you heard me say this if the names on Wall Street were named so let the
[40:20.160 --> 40:26.400]  Caruso Mondavi butoni Rossini Bellini they call it the mafia but you're not
[40:26.400 --> 40:31.080]  allowed to call these white shoe boys crooks and criminals oh no they don't
[40:31.080 --> 40:35.600]  do loan-shocking that's just the cause of doing business to charge 30% on a
[40:35.600 --> 40:41.840]  credit card oh no they don't do Ponzi schemes or pyramid scams they do credit
[40:41.840 --> 40:46.040]  the false swaps auction rate securities no and they're blaming it on
[40:46.040 --> 40:51.240]  capitalism just like you said to turn it into fascism there's nothing wrong with
[40:51.240 --> 40:56.200]  capitalism this is greed and corruption this is the Robert Rubens this is the
[40:56.200 --> 41:01.440]  Henry Paulson's this is the Larry Summers the genius Larry the genius
[41:01.440 --> 41:06.640]  summers these are the people that have created it Timothy Geithner there's
[41:06.640 --> 41:10.880]  nothing wrong with capitalism so they're going to blame it on capitalism and
[41:10.880 --> 41:15.860]  just like you pointed out they're going to use it to turn it around to gain more
[41:15.860 --> 41:23.360]  control and what's amazing about this is we know that it's made off who found
[41:23.360 --> 41:26.920]  of the Nasdaq we know it's Ken lay that came up with the global carbon trading
[41:26.920 --> 41:32.160]  scam Schwarzenegger's announcing he's gonna ban TVs above 40 inches tax all
[41:32.160 --> 41:39.200]  the rest taxes on firearms taxes on farms taxes on ranches taxes on beef taxes
[41:39.200 --> 41:46.480]  on plastic a wet blanket on already staggering economy that is burning out
[41:46.480 --> 41:51.160]  that is becoming extinguished they want to destroy the economy so that they can
[41:51.160 --> 41:56.280]  consolidate it and we witness these criminals just expanding their scams
[41:56.280 --> 42:02.880]  and never stopping and only getting more more greedy with no end in sight no
[42:02.880 --> 42:07.800]  end in sight here's another trend that we're working on two trends the first
[42:07.800 --> 42:15.480]  one was for 20 for 2010 is territory 2010 the next one is by America as they

[47:29.080 --> 47:32.640]  Alex Jones
[47:37.160 --> 47:41.440]  we're gonna go to Michael Nicky Luke captain truth and others for trends
[47:41.440 --> 47:46.920]  forecaster Gerald Salente but I wanted to finish up talking about Obama it's
[47:46.920 --> 47:50.360]  just like when you grow up loving a football team you identify with it like
[47:50.360 --> 47:54.880]  a political party you don't want to admit when it's doing things wrong or
[47:54.880 --> 48:00.200]  lying to you and so many Americans this is changing and that's our salvation
[48:00.200 --> 48:05.560]  politically that the Republicans the leadership will lie to you they work for
[48:05.560 --> 48:09.360]  the same special interest the Democrats work for the same offshore criminal
[48:09.360 --> 48:13.120]  special interest but you talk to Obama supporters and it's just like Bush
[48:13.120 --> 48:17.480]  supporters we would say he's spying on you he's setting up Homeland Security for
[48:17.480 --> 48:22.520]  gun owners conservatives libertarians they're setting up brigade homeland
[48:22.520 --> 48:26.800]  through North com to use the military against us he lied about WMD's he's
[48:26.800 --> 48:31.200]  torturing people he's tripled the size of government he's going along with all
[48:31.200 --> 48:35.760]  the Clinton advisors from before him with this seamless scam the politicians
[48:35.760 --> 48:40.840]  change but the Wall Street cronies stay in place and they wouldn't listen now as
[48:40.840 --> 48:44.000]  soon as Bush left office they suddenly woke up to all these issues and got
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.720]  upset because now they saw Obama carrying out the issues suddenly Democrats
[48:48.720 --> 48:53.120]  that could see what Bush was doing that was wrong were blind to Obama and they'll
[48:53.120 --> 48:56.840]  get this sickening smile and say you're just jealous of him you're just a
[48:56.840 --> 49:01.000]  Republican you're just a racist you just don't like him you got to give him
[49:01.000 --> 49:05.800]  time when he's lied as we mentioned earlier about everything a new standard
[49:05.800 --> 49:10.880]  in line worse than Clinton worse than Bush worse than tricky Dick Nixon now
[49:10.880 --> 49:14.320]  they're having to give Senate speeches on the floor about his enemies list I'm
[49:14.320 --> 49:19.360]  listed in the news as in the top 25 White House enemies for Obama deception
[49:19.360 --> 49:22.840]  they're really gonna hate follow the Republic it's now launched it's now
[49:22.840 --> 49:28.480]  dropped and it's this delusional syndrome where either people are waking up
[49:28.480 --> 49:32.800]  more than ever we see a quickening there huge numbers waking up but still
[49:32.800 --> 49:37.360]  those that are staying asleep are getting even stupider they love being
[49:37.360 --> 49:41.800]  abused they love being lied to they love being scammed they think it's cute
[49:41.800 --> 49:45.960]  they think it's funny they have invested in Obama they have invested in the
[49:45.960 --> 49:50.960]  government it's a it's a matrix of lies the lies are so big that the general
[49:50.960 --> 49:54.400]  public just doesn't even know what to do it's like the media Gerald saying
[49:54.400 --> 49:58.480]  there's no mercury in the shot as I mentioned when I have the insert for the
[49:58.480 --> 50:03.760]  H1N1 shot right here and FDA.gov saying can give you gillian berets and can
[50:03.760 --> 50:07.960]  sterilize you and give you cancer I mean it's just what's gonna happen to the
[50:07.960 --> 50:12.760]  system as as people finally wake up to the fact that they've been completely
[50:12.760 --> 50:17.760]  screwed well again we're seeing it this is again as we've mentioned many times
[50:17.760 --> 50:23.000]  and have been writing about it since 2002 and that this is much more than an
[50:23.000 --> 50:28.000]  economic crisis this is the this is the decline of Empire America we've lost
[50:28.000 --> 50:34.840]  our morality and you know morals don't change values do and and people have
[50:34.840 --> 50:39.440]  lost their own self-respect but when they talk about health care reform what
[50:39.440 --> 50:42.720]  are you gonna reform look at look at the look at this nation as a junk food
[50:42.720 --> 50:46.960]  eating nation they poison their bodies with junk food they poison their minds
[50:46.960 --> 50:52.320]  with junk information how could any how could any intelligent adult turn on the
[50:52.320 --> 50:57.200]  TV and listen to you know the nightly news or any of this other stuff when you
[50:57.200 --> 51:01.600]  have these bad actors he's great the actors reading scripts and that talk
[51:01.600 --> 51:06.080]  about Michael Jackson for a month and a half so the people again with the
[51:06.080 --> 51:09.800]  America's the first second and third world nation wrapped into one we're
[51:09.800 --> 51:15.880]  looking at a good 20% of the people right now that are neither right or left
[51:15.880 --> 51:22.160]  they're all independent thinkers that are are going to be at the forefront of
[51:22.160 --> 51:27.720]  this revolution so again we see this breaking down and we also see the nation
[51:27.720 --> 51:32.880]  breaking down and we could see it breaking down into smaller parts well
[51:32.880 --> 51:37.520]  Gerald before the mainstream media with other inoculation campaigns they push
[51:37.520 --> 51:42.320]  they would just beat around the bush never say there wasn't mercury in it
[51:42.320 --> 51:46.360]  they would just leave that out and say it's safe now the New York Times and
[51:46.360 --> 51:50.960]  government program for public schools lies and gives parents and school
[51:50.960 --> 51:56.880]  children a handout saying there is no mercury there is no no adjuvants it
[51:56.880 --> 52:02.000]  cannot there are no side effects when every of the five versions of the
[52:02.000 --> 52:07.760]  vaccine I'm holding one anyone can get this at Walgreens saying it can give you
[52:07.760 --> 52:12.840]  neurological disorders saying it can sterilize you saying it has mercury I
[52:12.840 --> 52:21.000]  mean I'm reading from FDA.gov influenza H1NW 2009 vaccine information sheet
[52:21.000 --> 52:26.800]  diagnostics limited put out by norvidus the main vaccine maker and it says look
[52:26.800 --> 52:31.920]  the New York Times is that the paper that took the nation to war against the
[52:31.920 --> 52:37.640]  rock with the stories of remember the aluminum tubes and the yellow cake I
[52:37.640 --> 52:42.680]  mean you know this is the New York Times that promoted the war this is the
[52:42.680 --> 52:48.680]  New York Times that when the markets were unfolding in August of 2007 quoted
[52:48.680 --> 52:55.480]  all these experts that said oh it's just a hiccup here in front of me the New
[52:55.480 --> 53:01.800]  York Times last Saturday October 17th this guy goes on to say well there are
[53:01.800 --> 53:05.360]  plenty of experts who will tell you the worst is over and I hope they're right
[53:05.360 --> 53:10.600]  but as Mr. Roth is about this book discovered in the 1930s the experts
[53:10.600 --> 53:17.880]  can't predict the future any better than the rest of us yes we can predict the
[53:17.880 --> 53:23.960]  future better than they can it's the arrogance of the New York Times with the
[53:23.960 --> 53:28.080]  time we have left Gerald finish up with other trends other predictions from
[53:28.080 --> 53:32.640]  because the current events form future trends in the last three minutes tell
[53:32.640 --> 53:36.360]  us what else we should be on the lookout for by the way Gerald Salente is in
[53:36.360 --> 53:41.200]  fall the Republic go ahead what people should be aware of now is that anything
[53:41.200 --> 53:45.840]  could happen and this is a time for survival strategies so prepare for the
[53:45.840 --> 53:49.720]  worst you always could move back from that and we're very concerned about the
[53:49.720 --> 53:56.280]  probabilities of bank holidays dollar devaluation and and those are our major
[53:56.280 --> 54:00.760]  concerns right now with the holidays coming up again you know rein in
[54:00.760 --> 54:05.480]  spending don't spend an extra penny that you don't have to and again don't
[54:05.480 --> 54:09.800]  support anything corporate that you don't have to the major trends we're
[54:09.800 --> 54:14.840]  looking at coming coming along the line is this trend we call selective
[54:14.840 --> 54:21.680]  technology learning how to do things simply a great story what's going on in
[54:21.680 --> 54:26.960]  India right now and this is how you can start making money it's using technology
[54:26.960 --> 54:31.240]  to help the poorest people so they have cell phones for example it only cost
[54:31.240 --> 54:36.000]  twenty dollars refrigerators that cost seventy dollars little stoves that was
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.320]  forty three dollars high technology I'm saying this because people looking for
[54:41.320 --> 54:45.800]  opportunities start looking for these kind of things to start selling in the
[54:45.800 --> 54:49.960]  states because the standard of living is going to continue to decline
[54:49.960 --> 54:54.320]  necessity is the mother of invention so we're gonna see a lot of inventing
[54:54.320 --> 54:59.640]  opportunities to start providing new products and services to a declining
[54:59.640 --> 55:06.840]  economy these are the ways to look also in the in the old areas of old cities
[55:06.840 --> 55:11.520]  you're going to start seeing them rebirth so people that are looking for
[55:11.520 --> 55:16.240]  investment opportunities in real estate as we are up here in Kingston New York
[55:16.240 --> 55:20.200]  you start looking for those beautiful old cities that haven't been destroyed
[55:20.200 --> 55:24.480]  through urban renewal because young people are going to be looking for
[55:24.480 --> 55:28.920]  places to live they're going to start moving back into these areas so those
[55:28.920 --> 55:32.760]  are areas by the way that's already starting we're already seeing a flood
[55:32.760 --> 55:37.160]  of people getting out of the cities into the country right and especially these
[55:37.160 --> 55:42.360]  great old small towns so those are the areas to look at a rebuilding of
[55:42.360 --> 55:48.640]  community and that old saying use it up wear it out make it do do without start
[55:48.640 --> 55:53.640]  buying quality products everything American grow your own food become more
[55:53.640 --> 55:58.720]  self-sustaining the products that you wish you have on on prison planet the
[55:58.720 --> 56:03.800]  other places around those are the things to start looking into heal yourself
[56:03.800 --> 56:09.280]  health care to this nation to get into shape and for people to survive what's
[56:09.280 --> 56:16.680]  coming ahead you need to be healthy spiritually emotionally and physically
[56:16.680 --> 56:20.880]  and in closing in the minute and a half we have a left I hope people will visit
[56:20.880 --> 56:24.680]  trendsresearch.com and check out all your other great work and also check you
[56:24.680 --> 56:29.080]  out and follow the Republic that just was released yesterday in closing how
[56:29.080 --> 56:32.480]  when will the tyranny peak when do you think we're going to come out of it
[56:32.480 --> 56:37.640]  2012 we don't see us coming out of this for a long time economically this is a
[56:37.640 --> 56:42.800]  long decline the only reason we got out of the last ones Alex go back to the
[56:42.800 --> 56:49.000]  dot-com bust of 2000 the five trillion dollars is wiped out of the market the
[56:49.000 --> 56:53.320]  way they got it out of it got it out was they lowered interest rates to 46 year
[56:53.320 --> 56:57.960]  lows now they've done it again they will and they created the credit crisis in
[56:57.960 --> 57:01.800]  the real estate bubble now they've created the bailout bubble what we're
[57:01.800 --> 57:06.440]  concerned about is that after the bailout bubble blows up then they take
[57:06.440 --> 57:11.120]  you to war so we're telling people to be on the alert don't buy into the
[57:11.120 --> 57:16.600]  allies and and and fight the tyranny ahead that's coming ahead by being
[57:16.600 --> 57:21.080]  knowledgeable so we're going and they're going to start also more and more
[57:21.080 --> 57:25.920]  pitting us against other people like they've taught us how to hate the
[57:25.920 --> 57:31.400]  Iranians how to hate Muslims beware of this kind of fear tactic you know the
[57:31.400 --> 57:36.520]  big lie works better than the little lie so the big lie watch out for that one
[57:36.520 --> 57:40.440]  hit we use the big lie they're going to use the big lie once all right
[57:40.440 --> 57:43.920]  Gerald Salente great job let me say bye to you during the break we'll come back

[57:49.960 --> 57:53.640]  Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[57:53.640 --> 57:57.800]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[57:57.800 --> 58:02.080]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[58:02.080 --> 58:06.080]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[58:06.080 --> 58:10.400]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[58:10.400 --> 58:14.760]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[58:14.760 --> 58:18.520]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[58:18.520 --> 58:22.640]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[58:22.640 --> 58:26.360]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[58:26.360 --> 58:30.440]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[58:30.440 --> 58:33.160]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from

[1:00:08.080 --> 1:00:13.200]  Jones your host Gerald Salente of trends research dot com is our guest for another
[1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:18.480]  30 minutes we're going straight to your calls before he leaves us more trends
[1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:24.640]  forecasting as we look over the horizon to the mind of Gerald Salente Cynthia in
[1:00:24.640 --> 1:00:29.920]  Maryland thanks for holding you're on the air worldwide welcome
[1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:35.800]  first of all I wanted to say before the break before this one I noticed that there
[1:00:35.800 --> 1:00:41.680]  was Dr. Who music playing in the background and I thought that was so
[1:00:41.680 --> 1:00:49.640]  apropos because I just wanted to say that Dr. Who Charlie Jade Eureka heroes
[1:00:49.640 --> 1:00:56.480]  and another show everybody knows them as science fiction but I have to say that
[1:00:56.480 --> 1:01:03.880]  they are based on fact there are a lot of aspects of those shows that are put
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:11.720]  into science fiction but are actually based on fact well when I grew up when
[1:01:11.720 --> 1:01:16.560]  I grew up hardly anybody had cable and we didn't have cable and I could one of
[1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:20.520]  the few shows on was Dr. Who and I watch it a few times but Paul Watson wrote an
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:24.880]  article a few years ago about the new Dr. Who where the government stages a fake
[1:01:24.880 --> 1:01:29.320]  alien attack on London as a pretext to crack down on the population do you have
[1:01:29.320 --> 1:01:34.120]  any questions for Gerald Salente no I just wanted to give some other
[1:01:34.120 --> 1:01:45.840]  educational resources being link link TV free speech TV WPFW and democracy now my
[1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:49.320]  problem with democracy now is it is better than some mainstream corporate
[1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:53.640]  media but it's still Ford Foundation funded and is still behind Obama but at
[1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:57.400]  least they did admit that Obama lied about how he wasn't gonna sign signing
[1:01:57.400 --> 1:02:01.480]  statements Gerald Salente I mean I mean we know they're liars but but you've been
[1:02:01.480 --> 1:02:05.400]  studying this for for 30 plus years and advising government corporations you
[1:02:05.400 --> 1:02:10.440]  name it is the line getting more intense or is it just we're aware of it
[1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:14.000]  because the New York Times and others have a school program where they give
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:18.280]  fact sheets to school children saying there is no mercury in the shots it
[1:02:18.280 --> 1:02:22.720]  doesn't give you neurological disorders it can't sterilize you but then the drug
[1:02:22.720 --> 1:02:30.680]  insert from FDA.gov I showed this on television radio show yesterday here
[1:02:30.680 --> 1:02:37.200]  they are says that it can do all of that and that there is mercury in it and so
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:42.240]  just all of the law and Obama he seems to have broken all the lying records in
[1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:47.440]  my book your take on that well he has and it's every time that you go through
[1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:52.360]  the litany of lies from Obama what he said he was going to do whether it has
[1:02:52.360 --> 1:03:02.640]  to do with habeas corpus rendition the Patriot Act wiretapping pulling the
[1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:10.440]  troops out of out of Iraq putting more troops into Afghanistan bombing sovereign
[1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:15.560]  nations you will you go after one one issue after another lobbyist lying
[1:03:15.560 --> 1:03:20.560]  saying you have he had he would have open government tell these things to his
[1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:25.080]  liberal supporters and what I say is that you go through the facts and they
[1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:29.280]  look at you and the only thing they could do is give you a key sheet and grin
[1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:35.440]  and a balsamic smile and they say well give him time or oh he can't really
[1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:40.440]  fight that much about this you just give him a chance what chance how much what
[1:03:40.440 --> 1:03:45.760]  he's one of them nothing has changed it's only a different team in there
[1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:50.920]  playing the same crooked games has the lying increased yes it has I've never
[1:03:50.920 --> 1:03:56.080]  seen anything like this before in my life it's one lie after another every day
[1:03:56.080 --> 1:04:00.840]  and but the biggest thing that's happened Alex between Bush and Obama in one
[1:04:00.840 --> 1:04:05.160]  year in one year is that this country went from the greatest entrepreneurial
[1:04:05.160 --> 1:04:09.120]  country in the world the one that was the envy of everybody that wanted to come
[1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:14.000]  here to make their mark to now a country that's too big to fail that they have
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:20.320]  jammed down the public's throats there's too big to fail lie and that all our
[1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:25.760]  resources should be going to protect them you know in our trends journal we
[1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:30.640]  did a story about this too big to fail when after Obama was elected in December
[1:04:30.640 --> 1:04:34.520]  they asked him why are we bailing out these companies and he came out with his
[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:39.200]  two-bit analogy well if your neighbor's house is on fire even if he smoked in
[1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:42.960]  bed or left a stove on wouldn't you want to put it out if it was going to catch
[1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:47.680]  your father out onto your house well seven months later on 60 minutes they
[1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:52.800]  asked federal chairman Bernanke the same question and you know what he said what
[1:04:52.800 --> 1:04:56.480]  if your house neighbor's house is on fire he left a stove on a smoked in bed
[1:04:56.480 --> 1:05:02.320]  wouldn't you want to put it on stay there we hundreds of nations have fallen
[1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:07.160]  to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive
[1:05:07.160 --> 1:05:11.440]  history as we're finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from
[1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:16.060]  underneath Americans at home turning menace influence on our president in
[1:05:16.060 --> 1:05:21.160]  Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of
[1:05:21.160 --> 1:05:26.200]  us as American citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the
[1:05:26.200 --> 1:05:31.000]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:34.960]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner
[1:05:34.960 --> 1:05:38.920]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[1:05:38.920 --> 1:05:43.000]  saying who do we make the check out to today seems like nobody does care and
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:49.040]  right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic yet your copy of
[1:05:49.040 --> 1:05:54.520]  fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com we're watching online right now
[1:05:54.520 --> 1:05:59.800]  in super high quality at prison planet dot TV
[1:06:02.600 --> 1:06:07.880]  they've run the system the whole economic system of the world for the last
[1:06:07.880 --> 1:06:13.120]  two and a half hundred years so why shouldn't they also run the economic
[1:06:13.120 --> 1:06:16.760]  system for the next few hundred years so is this some sort of new world order
[1:06:16.760 --> 1:06:20.960]  which Gordon Brown kind of alluded to I think the new world order is emerging we
[1:06:20.960 --> 1:06:26.760]  have to stand up to preserve a republic here and a rule of law which is under
[1:06:26.760 --> 1:06:31.760]  dire threat for a couple of hours you could say mr. Obama was president of
[1:06:31.760 --> 1:06:36.600]  the world Obama has been quite clear by his actions never mind his words his
[1:06:36.600 --> 1:06:43.080]  actions as to who owns him who he works for and who he serves and it's not the
[1:06:43.080 --> 1:06:48.560]  American people just as George W. Bush betrayed his foolish followers so must
[1:06:48.560 --> 1:06:53.720]  Obama because his only allegiance is to his offshore masters summers tells
[1:06:53.720 --> 1:06:58.920]  Obama what to do summers tells Geithner what to do so we had snow we had
[1:06:58.920 --> 1:07:02.760]  Paulson now we have Geithner all these people cut from the same bowl the clock
[1:07:02.760 --> 1:07:06.440]  all you folks don't even realize that you're helping people that you're
[1:07:06.440 --> 1:07:12.480]  associated with and you should be recuding yourself I you know I behaved
[1:07:12.480 --> 1:07:17.760]  with the you don't think you should have recrused yourself every time in
[1:07:17.760 --> 1:07:21.800]  history when a group of banks in conjunction with the government was
[1:07:21.800 --> 1:07:27.560]  given the power to expand the money supply at will those economic systems
[1:07:27.560 --> 1:07:31.560]  always collapsed if they make a mistake they get bailed out if everyone else
[1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:35.040]  makes a mistake they get put in jail call the terrorists the tune of twenty
[1:07:35.040 --> 1:07:39.080]  three trillion seven hundred billion dollars worth of taxpayer exposure for
[1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:46.920]  the bailouts is quite striking this is by probably an order of magnitude the
[1:07:46.920 --> 1:07:53.040]  biggest fraud in history why would you need international bankers why would
[1:07:53.040 --> 1:07:58.120]  any government agreed to use them it's nothing more than a private hostile
[1:07:58.120 --> 1:08:04.400]  corporate takeover of every sovereign nation on earth so for the first time
[1:08:04.400 --> 1:08:11.360]  in history we really have this new form of an empire full of the Republic
[1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:19.520]  volume one the presidency of Barack Obama available on DVD at info wars.com
[1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:26.320]  and online at prison planet TV the destiny of humanity is in our hands
[1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:39.440]  October 21st 2009 I'm Alex Jones your host we are joined till 45 after by Dr.
[1:08:39.440 --> 1:08:44.200]  Paul Craig Roberts former head of policy Department of Treasury under Ronald
[1:08:44.200 --> 1:08:49.320]  Reagan best-selling author former Wall Street Journal editor and also a great
[1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:54.160]  patriot fighting just the corporate looting that's going on he's very
[1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:58.320]  critical of George W. Bush he hoped Obama would be better obviously he's now
[1:08:58.320 --> 1:09:02.560]  pointed out that Obama's already many cases surpassed the tyranny of George
[1:09:02.560 --> 1:09:06.600]  Bush now the outrage of Obama being given the peace prize he's actually sent
[1:09:06.600 --> 1:09:10.800]  tens of thousands more troops to Afghanistan continuing the torture the
[1:09:10.800 --> 1:09:15.160]  secret arrest we'll talk about that the deterioration and the dollar where all
[1:09:15.160 --> 1:09:19.960]  of this is going is the headline correct in major newspapers that I read
[1:09:19.960 --> 1:09:26.320]  earlier saying that already government central banks are moving to the majority
[1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:31.080]  in buying euros and other currencies as the reserve we are joined by Dr. Paul
[1:09:31.080 --> 1:09:36.920]  Craig Roberts doc it's good to have you here with us today hey Alex so much is
[1:09:36.920 --> 1:09:42.280]  happening let's get into Obama and where he's going and the peace prize and
[1:09:42.280 --> 1:09:51.000]  your take on that well they gave the peace prize to a war monger didn't they
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:10:00.760]  this is the guy who started a new war in Pakistan and who has increased the war
[1:10:00.760 --> 1:10:10.080]  in Afghanistan in fact today there's a report on anti-war.com that he's told
[1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:17.680]  the British he was going to send in 45,000 more Americans and this was part
[1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:25.560]  of his guarantee to them to get them to send a few hundred more troops so you
[1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:30.880]  know it's I wrote a column about it and said that it it took longer than George
[1:10:30.880 --> 1:10:38.760]  Orwell fought to reach his version of 1984 but we'd now reached it we'd given
[1:10:38.760 --> 1:10:45.080]  the peace prize to the war monger now the local committee claims that well if
[1:10:45.080 --> 1:10:51.400]  they did it they made a decision two weeks after his election because of his
[1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:59.880]  rhetoric he was seeing he was talking different from Bush and so they were
[1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:06.440]  hopeful they could somehow give him the peace prize and make it harder for him
[1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:14.720]  to be a war monger. That could work but I think most likely all it's done is to
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:25.240]  make make the slogan that Orwell has in 1984 war is peace the reality for us so
[1:11:25.240 --> 1:11:30.480]  now war is peace. But it has seemed to have blown up in the Nobel Committee's
[1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:36.720]  face and making him the head on the rotating board of the UN Security
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:41.320]  Council trying to push him as this global peacemaker when clearly he's
[1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:47.560]  continuing the exact agenda that we had under George W. Bush I mean I think this
[1:11:47.560 --> 1:11:50.160]  is one of the straws that broke the camel's back and I've seen that the
[1:11:50.160 --> 1:11:54.360]  Nobel Committee as you mentioned is now starting to backtrack and apologize and
[1:11:54.360 --> 1:11:59.640]  I did hear on local radio news actually a national news feed Fox News was
[1:11:59.640 --> 1:12:04.960]  reporting that yes he's confirmed that he's gonna send 40 to 48,000 you're
[1:12:04.960 --> 1:12:10.080]  seeing anti-war as 45,000 whatever it's over 40,000 he sent more than 25,000
[1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:16.960]  earlier he secretly sent 13,000 more that was confirmed and so he's he he took
[1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:24.200]  50,000 out of Iraq but then put 50,000 more contractors in and so I guess this
[1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:29.600]  gives new meaning to the word you know words over actions because we've got
[1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:35.120]  Code Pink now endorsing the war, Huffington Post just endorsed more war and so
[1:12:35.120 --> 1:12:41.080]  now it's the liberal thing to do to go into the place that no army's ever
[1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:49.440]  defeated. Right and of course you know the the worst part about it is all the
[1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:56.400]  people there who'll be killed we seldom kill any of the of the fighters not that
[1:12:56.400 --> 1:12:59.640]  we have any right to kill them because we've invaded them they haven't done
[1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:08.040]  anything to us but we mainly kill women and children and village elders and it's
[1:13:08.040 --> 1:13:15.760]  just sort of a crazed act of murder that's all it is like it was in Iraq you
[1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:20.960]  know if you count the displaced and the dead they lost a fifth of the
[1:13:20.960 --> 1:13:26.160]  population and allegedly we did this to benefit them well how do you
[1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:31.960]  benefit people when you bring nothing but death and destruction what is the
[1:13:31.960 --> 1:13:37.240]  agenda what is the agenda why are they expanding into Pakistan is it to encircle
[1:13:37.240 --> 1:13:42.600]  Iran and China is it to control the opium is it to for weapon sales the
[1:13:42.600 --> 1:13:47.800]  unicol pipelines they even admit I saw CNN with a general admit there was a
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:53.880]  staged election I mean I have to pinch myself every day what is the point more
[1:13:53.880 --> 1:13:58.680]  troops in Afghanistan means more targets those warlords are always fighting
[1:13:58.680 --> 1:14:02.840]  with each other over the opium money it's never going to end that place has
[1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:08.640]  been in war for two and two thousand three hundred years why are we there
[1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:20.160]  well I I can't say I know for sure we're there because of 9-11 which you and I
[1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:26.840]  regard as an inside job and that was an excuse to start a war there but they
[1:14:26.840 --> 1:14:31.320]  really weren't mainly interested in Afghanistan they wanted to invade Iraq
[1:14:31.320 --> 1:14:41.160]  and so it was kind of a beginning of a war that they could spread where they
[1:14:41.160 --> 1:14:46.840]  really wanted it now of course while we're staying there probably the
[1:14:46.840 --> 1:14:56.800]  Israelis want us involved if we pull out of Afghanistan then we might not attack
[1:14:56.800 --> 1:15:04.680]  Iran or we may pull out of Iraq but the whole thing that they stirred up with a
[1:15:04.680 --> 1:15:10.240]  neoconservatives you know would simply pass away and be for naught so I think
[1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:15.760]  the Israelis want to keep us there well wouldn't you make a serious serious
[1:15:15.760 --> 1:15:22.480]  error like going in there you get so many interest groups and politics that it
[1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:29.280]  makes makes it hard to get out it's just gonna be continual occupation of
[1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:32.920]  Central Asia for the foreseeable future you're right they're talking about a
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:38.720]  decade more that's 18 years it's like Germany we've been there since 45 never
[1:15:38.720 --> 1:15:45.400]  leaving been in Korea for 50 years never leaving more than 50 years and we pay
[1:15:45.400 --> 1:15:50.080]  for it and meanwhile the weapons manufacturers make a bunch of money our
[1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:54.480]  troops get killed but generals get to pin more rebels on their chest we'll
[1:15:54.480 --> 1:16:00.640]  talk about the dollar and the death of the empire fall the republic hello this

[1:20:02.720 --> 1:20:31.320]  Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network network things
[1:20:31.320 --> 1:20:37.320]  are happening that are so big right now that I've been lately point out to
[1:20:37.320 --> 1:20:41.800]  listeners I'm in above my head Dr. Roberts I'm ranting here but but I mean
[1:20:41.800 --> 1:20:44.440]  can you extract something from what I've said and give me your take on it I mean
[1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:49.600]  I'm just I'm getting to the point where I feel overwhelmed yeah well all those
[1:20:49.600 --> 1:20:56.520]  the things you mentioned earlier all the paths was going down I think they're
[1:20:56.520 --> 1:21:01.680]  going to get you know in this next year something is going to happen to push up
[1:21:01.680 --> 1:21:11.080]  interest rates either domestic inflation from from money creation or the
[1:21:11.080 --> 1:21:17.280]  inability of the of the Treasury to borrow at these extremely low interest
[1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:24.840]  rates and when that happens then the economy which is already suffering
[1:21:24.840 --> 1:21:30.680]  despite practically zero interest rates will suffer more and the unemployment
[1:21:30.680 --> 1:21:37.240]  rate measured the way it was measured when I was in the Treasuries now 21% so
[1:21:37.240 --> 1:21:43.320]  it can go a lot higher in the meantime the corporations are continuing to
[1:21:43.320 --> 1:21:48.960]  offshore jobs they're continuing to bring in foreigners on work pieces and the
[1:21:48.960 --> 1:21:54.440]  high rates of legal immigration continue so that there are more and more people
[1:21:54.440 --> 1:22:03.240]  competing for fewer jobs so this has to bring even more pressure on the on the
[1:22:03.240 --> 1:22:12.280]  American people and and they're already suffering look you see today or yesterday
[1:22:12.280 --> 1:22:17.200]  it was reported that the investment banks are making so much money they're
[1:22:17.200 --> 1:22:25.000]  back to those massive bonuses and it says it Goldman Sachs is going to give an
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:34.800]  average payout of 500,000 pounds British pounds that's 800,000 dollars to each of
[1:22:34.800 --> 1:22:44.080]  its 5,500 London staff the senior executives are going to get bonuses of
[1:22:44.080 --> 1:22:50.920]  several million pounds and the top one's 10 million pounds that's 16 million
[1:22:50.920 --> 1:22:56.640]  dollars so they're paying out these kinds of bonuses while New York City for
[1:22:56.640 --> 1:23:04.720]  example now has record homelessness with 16,000 kids and homeless shelters it's
[1:23:04.720 --> 1:23:11.400]  so bad the city is giving free one-way airline tickets trying to get the
[1:23:11.400 --> 1:23:19.600]  homeless to fly out the city Detroit is completely collapsing Detroit but look
[1:23:19.600 --> 1:23:25.680]  here here is the telltale sign New York's Fifth Avenue one of the most
[1:23:25.680 --> 1:23:33.560]  famous shopping meccas in the world it's now got a 15.3% vacancy rate on Fifth
[1:23:33.560 --> 1:23:43.040]  Avenue in prime commercial real estate John Williams reported today that when
[1:23:43.040 --> 1:23:49.120]  you look at retail sales adjusted for inflation currently they are at the level
[1:23:49.120 --> 1:23:56.120]  of 10 years ago he says that 10 years worth of retail sales growth has been
[1:23:56.120 --> 1:24:03.120]  destroyed and he you know and I agree with him that this this the crisis is
[1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:08.920]  just starting it's not really even well on the way and that's the question for
[1:24:08.920 --> 1:24:13.360]  you sir so the slide you're saying and everybody else is now saying you were
[1:24:13.360 --> 1:24:16.640]  talking about dollar and trouble three years ago they weren't now it's mainstream
[1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:24.360]  news is it a slow slide into Third World oblivion or is or is it going to come
[1:24:24.360 --> 1:24:30.760]  quicker and what are the people going to do as New York State has passed 84 new
[1:24:30.760 --> 1:24:36.000]  taxes I was reading last week in the last year the government just keeps
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:41.280]  growing the government keeps adding people everybody I know is having really
[1:24:41.280 --> 1:24:45.880]  you know seeing cuts in pay or losing their jobs and the media is saying the
[1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:52.840]  economy is recovered I mean it what where is this going well you know we
[1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:56.360]  don't have you know as well as I do we don't have a media the media serves as
[1:24:56.360 --> 1:25:02.200]  the Ministry of Truth or the Ministry of Propaganda you know and whatever it says
[1:25:02.200 --> 1:25:11.400]  is is unbelievable I don't know what what capacity that people have to realize
[1:25:11.400 --> 1:25:15.880]  what's being done to them well that was my next question is the media is now
[1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:19.440]  saying Iran is killing the dollar I'm sure you see that I mean you just
[1:25:19.440 --> 1:25:22.640]  mentioned it and they're saying the Russians and Chinese are doing it but I
[1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:26.640]  read what the Russians and Chinese and the Arabs are saying and the
[1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:30.360]  Persians are saying they're going look all these countries we keep buying your
[1:25:30.360 --> 1:25:36.080]  dollars we're losing 10% on this in the last year your central banks are
[1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:40.920]  have engaged in the policies that are doing this please stop and then
[1:25:40.920 --> 1:25:44.160]  meanwhile the Federal Reserve comes out and blames them when when they're the
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:48.600]  very grip doing it right see I don't think anybody's trying to kill the
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:54.240]  dollar on purpose I think the dollar is being killed because of the hubris and
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:59.160]  stupidity of the American policy makers and the rest of the world sits there
[1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:03.200]  and watches this and says well look they're going to kill it and they won't
[1:26:03.200 --> 1:26:07.400]  listen there's nothing we can do so let's be prepared and have something to
[1:26:07.400 --> 1:26:12.240]  use when they succeed in through hubris and stupidity and killing the
[1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:17.560]  currency and so in the old days the depression when people lost their jobs
[1:26:17.560 --> 1:26:24.360]  prices were falling it's different if you lose your job prices are rising and so
[1:26:24.360 --> 1:26:29.920]  I think they've managed to fix a situation create situation that's too big
[1:26:29.920 --> 1:26:37.000]  for them to handle and I'm not sure they can handle the American population
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:44.200]  look just remember they could not successively occupy back debt the United
[1:26:44.200 --> 1:26:49.960]  States is a big place it's a lot bigger than Afghanistan that's why they're
[1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:53.200]  trying to recruit the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts to spy on people right now but
[1:26:53.200 --> 1:26:57.520]  I agree it's not going to go well and it's a disaster in the main it's like
[1:26:57.520 --> 1:27:01.840]  watching a train wreck as it's starting and we're watching it derail and cars
[1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:06.240]  are flipping over and people are flying out and the general public's still in a
[1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:08.640]  trance I think a lot of them are starting to wake up as I talked about
[1:27:08.640 --> 1:27:13.760]  earlier but people are waking up but they don't know what to do and I don't
[1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:18.280]  know what to do because we know who the what the establishments done we know
[1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:23.480]  what they're setting up and they don't care they're just committed and they're
[1:27:23.480 --> 1:27:28.520]  doing it and they're wrecking all our futures right in front of us and I think
[1:27:28.520 --> 1:27:33.000]  like Ron Paula said we just got to identify who did it so that they don't
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:36.960]  use this crisis to get even more power and then hopefully this crisis like a
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:41.480]  fever will will will will get rid of this disease and then we can rebuild our
[1:27:41.480 --> 1:27:45.040]  country kind of like after the collapse of Russia your final comment on that
[1:27:45.040 --> 1:27:50.720]  doctor well it could well be we'll find ourselves ruled by the IMF will be under
[1:27:50.720 --> 1:27:59.200]  IMF austerity plan forcing us to balance our exports imports forcing us to
[1:27:59.200 --> 1:28:04.200]  balance our budget the sort of thing that we've done to lesser developed
[1:28:04.200 --> 1:28:09.200]  countries for decades so this may be what we face in the future the world
[1:28:09.200 --> 1:28:13.040]  may say we've had enough of you and your stupidity and all the trouble you
[1:28:13.040 --> 1:28:18.840]  cause everybody and now you're gonna do as we say or you're not gonna have any
[1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:27.160]  gas nor so that may be our future when they may put us into the box that we

[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:29.360]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[1:32:29.360 --> 1:32:33.080]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their

[1:33:43.360 --> 1:33:50.240]  webster continuing along the line of these stage terror attacks using
[1:33:50.240 --> 1:33:56.120]  proxies from the west against the Iranians openly trying to go them a type
[1:33:56.120 --> 1:34:02.200]  of false flag to start responding just like they had snuck attack Russia on 888
[1:34:02.200 --> 1:34:05.560]  and said Russia did it and a week later it came out it was all alive but they
[1:34:05.560 --> 1:34:11.400]  don't care they just have disdain and contempt for the public that can't some
[1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:16.680]  of them I guess find their butt with both hands but where is this going what's
[1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:20.080]  the reason for this well one one other feature of Baluchis down that's
[1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:23.920]  important is that that's we have this very important city of Gwadar this key
[1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:29.040]  strategic port it's estimated that 40% of the oil tankers in the world go past
[1:34:29.040 --> 1:34:34.520]  the port of Gwadar and the the plan has always been to make an oil tanker
[1:34:34.520 --> 1:34:38.720]  terminal at Gwadar so that if you're coming out of Kuwait or Saudi Arabia
[1:34:38.720 --> 1:34:44.360]  with a tanker load of oil you put that into a pipeline that would go up through
[1:34:44.360 --> 1:34:50.520]  Pakistan and that would that would then get you into China so the Chinese would
[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:54.600]  would have a guaranteed source of oil you look at Baluchistan Baluchistan cuts
[1:34:54.600 --> 1:34:59.800]  into Afghanistan the southern part of that it gives you a big chunk of Pakistan
[1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:04.320]  and it gives you a significant part of Iran so this is one of the microstates
[1:35:04.320 --> 1:35:08.720]  in many states that the new Brzezinski writes about in his books and which are
[1:35:08.720 --> 1:35:13.200]  the goal of the Obama administration places like push to this time that would
[1:35:13.200 --> 1:35:18.000]  cut into Pakistan and Afghanistan so this is Brzezinski geopolitical designs
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:21.920]  written all over absolutely and it's only part of a pattern now inside Iran
[1:35:21.920 --> 1:35:25.840]  there were four or five of these ethnic groups you got the Baluchis you've got
[1:35:25.840 --> 1:35:30.400]  a significant Arab minority along the Gulf and that's where you've got your
[1:35:30.400 --> 1:35:37.600]  tanker terminal at Carg Island and you're up the Abadan refinery one of the
[1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:42.000]  largest in the world there's also a Kurdish minority that the CIA has been
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:47.080]  playing out of Iraq there's an Azeri minority coming from North Kuwait they
[1:35:47.080 --> 1:35:51.360]  want to knock out the police intelligence bureau there so they can move more
[1:35:51.360 --> 1:35:55.640]  terror forces and to further destabilize the area right and you've also got
[1:35:55.640 --> 1:36:00.040]  then this green revolution you've got the CIA coup faction right the rich and
[1:36:00.040 --> 1:36:04.520]  leaders and desperate housewives of North Tehran with their leaders Musavi
[1:36:04.520 --> 1:36:09.360]  and Rafsanjani and they run around chanting death to Russia death to
[1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:12.960]  China that couldn't be any clearer if they see his power they'd cut off the
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:18.760]  oil to China and make trouble for Russia so this explains why Ahmadinejad is
[1:36:18.760 --> 1:36:22.880]  looking more and more like a traditional military dictator leaning
[1:36:22.880 --> 1:36:26.960]  primarily on Russia and the US is interestingly enough on the side of the
[1:36:26.960 --> 1:36:32.040]  mullahs of the most benighted sort when you get into the situation in in Tehran
[1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:37.400]  so the idea is to tear Iran apart from several points of view I do not think
[1:36:37.400 --> 1:36:42.720]  that there will be a huge bombing raid on Iran their acts of war going on this
[1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:46.560]  this was one of them and these have been going on in these peripheral ethnic
[1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:51.320]  areas for quite a while at the end of it the Persians themselves would be left
[1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:56.880]  in a almost landlocked internal part of the country Iranistan with very little
[1:36:56.880 --> 1:37:02.880]  oil and and very little perspective so that will be this question Webster then
[1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:08.320]  what's the main strategic reason for this are they trying to get the Iranians
[1:37:08.320 --> 1:37:12.960]  to launch attacks is there truth to the Western headlines that republic that the
[1:37:12.960 --> 1:37:17.640]  guard heads the generals are saying we will we will counter strike or or as
[1:37:17.640 --> 1:37:21.680]  that lies well certainly they're going to retaliate if there were a huge bombing
[1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:25.440]  raid on on Iran and their nuclear facilities naturally they retaliate
[1:37:25.440 --> 1:37:29.640]  with with whatever they had they could probably cut the the tanker traffic to
[1:37:29.640 --> 1:37:35.280]  the day they're going to respond to this well in this case though I think it'll
[1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:40.480]  be proportional and what that is I guess remains to be seen the general idea
[1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:44.600]  though is to weaken Iran and play Iran against Russia and China
[1:37:44.600 --> 1:37:49.560]  Briginski's goal is not not to have the u.s. at war with Iran what's the point
[1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:54.200]  of that the point is to get Iran if possible at either at war or locked in
[1:37:54.200 --> 1:37:58.760]  conflict with Russia and China who are the main geopolitical enemies now that
[1:37:58.760 --> 1:38:03.520]  Obama has come in and replaced the neocons more or less what do you see
[1:38:03.520 --> 1:38:09.520]  happening in Iran where's this going I think the green crew has failed I think
[1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:14.000]  it'll take a while for the for the CIA and company to figure that out but the
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:18.280]  attempt to overthrow the government is failing and I do think Ahmadinejad will
[1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:23.320]  evolve more and more towards a rather traditional military dictatorship he's a
[1:38:23.320 --> 1:38:27.760]  military man and I imagine they'll be able to deal with these peripheral
[1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:34.280]  terrorists in the relatively brutal way that that would be would be usual the
[1:38:34.280 --> 1:38:40.440]  savoc methods I suppose yes the savoc savama savoc all right Webster
[1:38:40.440 --> 1:38:45.280]  terribly stay there I want to shift gears out of this into the economy okay
[1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:48.400]  Webster I'm gonna let you take it out to break in five minutes I've actually got
[1:38:48.400 --> 1:38:52.640]  to go work on it stuff and give some orders here take us to break with the
[1:38:52.640 --> 1:38:55.880]  gendela situation and we'll come back finish up with that then get into the
[1:38:55.880 --> 1:39:00.520]  economics the banking meltdown you predicted a decade ago Webster terribly
[1:39:00.520 --> 1:39:05.000]  good to have you here with us thank you very much Alex let me let me address
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:08.760]  this this terror attack since that that's our our leading issue at the moment
[1:39:08.760 --> 1:39:17.240]  this was a suicide bomb in the province of Balochistan that is to say in the
[1:39:17.240 --> 1:39:24.360]  southeast of Iran near the border with Pakistan and it was claimed by this
[1:39:24.360 --> 1:39:30.520]  jundala organization which is simply a CIA mi6 secret army it's a well-known
[1:39:30.520 --> 1:39:35.640]  front now this was a very serious bombing attack it was a an assembly of
[1:39:35.640 --> 1:39:41.840]  local and regional notables as well as some representatives from Tehran it was
[1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:46.440]  a kind of a ceremonial occasion and it killed about 30 people according to some
[1:39:46.440 --> 1:39:50.960]  accounts and up to 60 people according to others and one of the people killed
[1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:56.680]  was the ground forces commander of the Iranian pasturon revolutionary guard as
[1:39:56.680 --> 1:40:01.520]  well as the commander of the revolutionary guard or pasturon in that
[1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:08.800]  the southeastern corner of Iran now this jundala has been around for quite a
[1:40:08.800 --> 1:40:12.320]  while and the Iranians know it well so the Iranian government immediately
[1:40:12.320 --> 1:40:18.240]  blamed the British as well as the US and the State Department spokesman here in
[1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:22.360]  Washington came out and said oh no we have nothing to do with that now it's
[1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:27.520]  absolutely absurd as Alex points out because it's a it's an absolute open
[1:40:27.520 --> 1:40:33.080]  secret that the US runs this I would say the British probably created it and
[1:40:33.080 --> 1:40:36.520]  continue to have significant influence but the money seems to be coming from the
[1:40:36.520 --> 1:40:40.880]  US and the targeting probably shared between Washington and London just a
[1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:45.880]  couple of these mainstream things in a little bit more detail back in February
[1:40:45.880 --> 1:40:51.740]  2007 we have the London Daily Telegraph notoriously close to NATO
[1:40:51.740 --> 1:40:57.440]  intelligence they quote a former high-ranking CIA official saying that
[1:40:57.440 --> 1:41:03.120]  it's not a great secret that jundala gets its money from the CIA classified
[1:41:03.120 --> 1:41:10.240]  budget that was 2007 they also have a guy called Fred Burton a former United
[1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:15.680]  States State Department counterterrorism official who says that these attacks
[1:41:15.680 --> 1:41:21.640]  that were taking place already then in 2007 are part of US efforts to supply and
[1:41:21.640 --> 1:41:27.440]  train Iran's ethnic minorities to destabilize the regime if that's not
[1:41:27.440 --> 1:41:33.400]  enough we have Brian Ross ABC television news you can see this on on TV for
[1:41:33.400 --> 1:41:42.760]  free April 2007 the US is encouraging and advising jundala and it's been run by
[1:41:42.760 --> 1:41:48.160]  the US essentially out of bases inside Pakistan but really not not something
[1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:51.960]  you can blame on Pakistan when the US and indeed the British are playing such
[1:41:51.960 --> 1:41:56.160]  an important role and then we have Seymour Hirsch these are the famous
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:01.320]  articles that he wrote in the New Yorker during those years and Seymour Hirsch
[1:42:01.320 --> 1:42:09.840]  gets gets a hold of Robert Bayer the former CIA official of clandestine
[1:42:09.840 --> 1:42:16.040]  services and he says that this is the US paying for this the US is working now
[1:42:16.040 --> 1:42:21.800]  with Sunni fundamentalists that's the trick with jundala jundala are Sunni
[1:42:21.800 --> 1:42:28.680]  terrorists of the Salafi persuasion and the idea is to set up a conflict
[1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:34.520]  which is ethnic as well as religious with the them being against the Persian
[1:42:34.520 --> 1:42:39.200]  Shiites breaking it down and from when I've read there's four
[1:42:39.200 --> 1:42:43.920]  different groups some are Wahhabis connected others Sunni break down all
[1:42:43.920 --> 1:42:50.160]  these groups for us and what Iran they do I mean imagine constant bombings
[1:42:50.160 --> 1:42:53.720]  blowing up government buildings blowing up their military blowing up their
[1:42:53.720 --> 1:43:01.120]  police it's just insane we'll be right back have you heard that millionaire
[1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:04.640]  entrepreneur businessman your congressional candidate and author

[1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:33.920]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[1:47:06.520 --> 1:47:10.600]  alex jones broadcasting network
[1:47:27.160 --> 1:47:31.040]  all right going back to Webster Tarpley Webster anything else on the Iran
[1:47:31.040 --> 1:47:35.120]  situation if not I want to then get into what's happening with Obama what's
[1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:39.800]  happening geopolitically I had seen AP articles about Obama gonna go after his
[1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:45.720]  enemies Obama is going to go after your people that have been criticizing him we
[1:47:45.720 --> 1:47:50.960]  see there George Soros has five different publications he admittedly owns
[1:47:50.960 --> 1:47:56.120]  and runs and pays for some he owns some he just finances attacking me saying I'm
[1:47:56.120 --> 1:48:00.240]  evil I'm the greatest threat oh I'm so horrible oh I'm this criminal oh I'm this
[1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:05.400]  right-winger all this made-up stuff new republic just said I'm this incredibly
[1:48:05.400 --> 1:48:09.560]  wicked dangerous person who it hypnotizes people and in this great
[1:48:09.560 --> 1:48:13.680]  threat that Obama deception is devastating I mean they're actually
[1:48:13.680 --> 1:48:16.840]  usually they just call you a kook and a nut they're saying I'm this great
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:22.600]  danger then it came out in the globe that there is a enemies list and of 25
[1:48:22.600 --> 1:48:28.520]  people I am number 24 your take on the enemies list well I'm sure they have an
[1:48:28.520 --> 1:48:31.640]  enemies list they have more than that I think they actually have departments in
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:35.680]  the White House there was a report coming from some people in Canada who had
[1:48:35.680 --> 1:48:39.280]  figured out that there was a there was a special department of the White House
[1:48:39.280 --> 1:48:44.320]  which dealt with the birth certificate issue raised by Phil Berg and others and
[1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:48.520]  that was all it did and I'm sure there's another one there for the Larry Sinclair
[1:48:48.520 --> 1:48:52.080]  issues and everything that goes to the news says I want to make a correction
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:56.120]  interrupting it's Lamar Alexander I Lamar Smith I get names turned around
[1:48:56.120 --> 1:49:00.600]  Senator Lamar Alexander go ahead so they do have an enemies list now in terms of
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:04.680]  the Obama deception and now the fall of the Republic the Obama deception in
[1:49:04.680 --> 1:49:10.640]  many ways is the the preparation for breaking the spell for dispelling the
[1:49:10.640 --> 1:49:16.400]  magic for bringing Obama down to earth I guess it must have come out in in May
[1:49:16.400 --> 1:49:20.480]  right and then during the summer it had a tremendous impact and what you saw
[1:49:20.480 --> 1:49:26.600]  then in June July August in terms of a populist rebellion of leftists and
[1:49:26.600 --> 1:49:31.400]  rightists against Obama because it was both you had old people who said I want
[1:49:31.400 --> 1:49:35.680]  my Medicare that's my Medicare from the New Deal in the great society and you
[1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:38.920]  take your hands off it Obama because you want to give the money to Wall Street
[1:49:38.920 --> 1:49:44.960]  what he really does so a broad consensus around that now the question is now with
[1:49:44.960 --> 1:49:48.840]  the fall of the Republic my ambition for the fall of the Republic is this should
[1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:54.800]  lead to gridlock in Washington we have two parties of scoundrels and incompetent
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:50:00.040]  they're corrupt they're stupid and they have all of these plans that we've
[1:50:00.040 --> 1:50:04.480]  been documenting the only possible perspective right now is we want gridlock
[1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:08.880]  we don't want any changes I don't want the changes Obama wants and I don't want
[1:50:08.880 --> 1:50:12.680]  the changes the Republicans want so let's have gridlock let's have these
[1:50:12.680 --> 1:50:17.560]  institutions be paralyzed up for the more let me ask you Webster what should I be
[1:50:17.560 --> 1:50:21.320]  doing because I really respect your perspective what should I be doing being
[1:50:21.320 --> 1:50:27.080]  on the top 25 enemies list of the White House I mean that's pretty creepy well
[1:50:27.080 --> 1:50:32.600]  that's that's a badge of honor of course congratulations that's excellent again
[1:50:32.600 --> 1:50:37.200]  the main thing I think is is to is to get into this idea the Obama health care
[1:50:37.200 --> 1:50:42.560]  reform is a monstrosity however there's a grave danger that Obama and the
[1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:46.600]  Republicans could make a deal the one thing they could agree on is they could
[1:50:46.600 --> 1:50:52.720]  say let's destroy Medicare let's take 500 billion out of Medicare let's strip
[1:50:52.720 --> 1:50:57.040]  the American people of their economic rights let's also destroy Medicaid in
[1:50:57.040 --> 1:51:00.720]  the process and this is this is something that some Republicans have said
[1:51:00.720 --> 1:51:05.640]  that they could see common ground with Obama when it comes to to a stripping
[1:51:05.640 --> 1:51:08.920]  away the economic right let me add this American people let me add this we're
[1:51:08.920 --> 1:51:11.040]  gonna get into the dollar because you're absolutely right when I was in the
[1:51:11.040 --> 1:51:14.400]  airport last Wednesday and bought this Wall Street Journal I'm showing people
[1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:20.000]  on TV Wednesday October 14th headline insurers stand against Obama committee's
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:27.040]  plan and then in the article they have the spokesman for the health care
[1:51:27.040 --> 1:51:32.520]  insurance lobby it says he's the head guy who speaks for them you know I guess
[1:51:32.520 --> 1:51:37.440]  from the papal seat and and and he's there speaking for them and he says we
[1:51:37.440 --> 1:51:43.920]  wrote this bill we wrote the takeover of health care and we want bigger finds if
[1:51:43.920 --> 1:51:47.400]  you don't come get our insurance so they can basically get get more money make
[1:51:47.400 --> 1:51:51.120]  you get their insurance then lower the care everything you said six months ago
[1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:55.080]  but then when you watch the mainstream news the the controlled left acts like
[1:51:55.080 --> 1:51:58.120]  oh insurance companies who were greedy and bad which they are greedy and bad
[1:51:58.120 --> 1:52:02.680]  many cases they don't want this bill when they wrote it now because of pressure
[1:52:02.680 --> 1:52:08.360]  stripping the the the fine if you don't get it and and and stripping a lot of
[1:52:08.360 --> 1:52:12.040]  this corporate welfare now they're threatening to back out of what they
[1:52:12.040 --> 1:52:17.000]  wrote so every time these fake George Soros leftists who just want a new tax
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:23.680]  on health care to pay to the banks every time they get cornered they come out
[1:52:23.680 --> 1:52:27.240]  and say oh people that don't want this government health care plan you know they
[1:52:27.240 --> 1:52:31.600]  are working for the health care industry it's the big health care fat cats that
[1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:36.040]  are behind this okay so whether it comes from Republicans or Democrats either
[1:52:36.040 --> 1:52:41.800]  way it's special interest trying to loot people because the system is so corrupt
[1:52:41.800 --> 1:52:45.880]  anyway you slice it they're involved in a fraud we'll have you back up soon to
[1:52:45.880 --> 1:52:49.560]  talk about that let's shift gears in the time we have left Webster the global
[1:52:49.560 --> 1:52:54.240]  economic crises that over 10 years ago you wrote your your your your your
[1:52:54.240 --> 1:52:58.440]  economic tone on we actually sell the latest edition of that at info wars
[1:52:58.440 --> 1:53:02.040]  com for people that are interested in surviving the economic cataclysm it's
[1:53:02.040 --> 1:53:07.240]  happening just as you broke it down what are we dealing with open g20 announcing
[1:53:07.240 --> 1:53:12.480]  world government carbon taxes will pay to them just just a planetary dictatorship
[1:53:12.480 --> 1:53:17.520]  run by a bunch of made-off Ken lay types where do you see all this going well I
[1:53:17.520 --> 1:53:21.200]  hope very much that this Copenhagen conference which they they wanted they
[1:53:21.200 --> 1:53:25.560]  want to impose this yoke they want to crucify humanity on a cross of carbon
[1:53:25.560 --> 1:53:30.160]  in Copenhagen in in December I hope that's gonna be a failure and there's
[1:53:30.160 --> 1:53:34.240]  some pretty powerful forces that are that are making it a failure China and
[1:53:34.240 --> 1:53:38.160]  India have had joint meetings where they say we will not be bound by this
[1:53:38.160 --> 1:53:42.840]  insanity we will not be stifled and strangled and and frustrated in our
[1:53:42.840 --> 1:53:46.800]  economic development because a bunch of rich elitists in London and New York
[1:53:46.800 --> 1:53:52.360]  decide that they have some carbon phobia carbon fetish whatever it is so I think
[1:53:52.360 --> 1:53:55.960]  there's a very good chance that the Copenhagen conference will blow up
[1:53:55.960 --> 1:53:59.920]  there will be a monumental failure I urge everybody to do everything in their
[1:53:59.920 --> 1:54:04.160]  power especially around the world make sure that that Copenhagen conference is
[1:54:04.160 --> 1:54:08.920]  a failure again gridlock we want gridlock that's the only possible outcome
[1:54:08.920 --> 1:54:13.040]  that that saves humanity under these conditions now the other thing is that
[1:54:13.040 --> 1:54:17.920]  the dollar crisis that you mentioned today the dollar is very weak it's a
[1:54:17.920 --> 1:54:22.280]  dollar fifty it's more than a dollar fifty to buy a euro that is very close
[1:54:22.280 --> 1:54:27.200]  to an all-time low and it's certainly a 14 month low the dollar index is below
[1:54:27.200 --> 1:54:33.320]  75 which is quite dramatic and at the same time this is the kind of thing that
[1:54:33.320 --> 1:54:38.120]  gets you into the geometry of hyperinflation you've got oil is up to
[1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:43.040]  almost eighty two dollars a barrel the oil has gone up well certainly more than
[1:54:43.040 --> 1:54:49.840]  10% just in the last five or six days so I think what you're heading for now is
[1:54:49.840 --> 1:54:55.360]  some kind of a dramatic moment hyperinflation takes off slowly and then
[1:54:55.360 --> 1:54:59.320]  it gathers steam and I'm afraid we're now in that kind of an area one thing
[1:54:59.320 --> 1:55:03.760]  that I would warn against the British remember that when you get a situation
[1:55:03.760 --> 1:55:08.520]  now of a latent crisis the crisis that it's about to explode the British
[1:55:08.520 --> 1:55:13.720]  specialty is to try to precipitate the crisis to to break it out in the open
[1:55:13.720 --> 1:55:19.040]  in such a way that they can export the depression to others to to the US to
[1:55:19.040 --> 1:55:23.200]  Europe to Japan whatever they can do this Robert Fisk article in the London
[1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:29.600]  Independent has been I think characterized by the Ria Novosti news agency as a
[1:55:29.600 --> 1:55:36.160]  plant by George Soros designed to create a dollar panic and to prevent any
[1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:41.160]  rational form of monetary reform it's just what the British do they did it in
[1:55:41.160 --> 1:55:46.040]  1931 when they went off goal they did it in 1971 when they brought down Bretton
[1:55:46.040 --> 1:55:50.280]  Woods they did it in 2000 and 2007 2008 they're trying to they're trying to
[1:55:50.280 --> 1:55:55.200]  extort six billion dollars from I so this does signify that the Anglo-American
[1:55:55.200 --> 1:56:00.320]  power elite are wanting to cause a global currency crisis now for a massive
[1:56:00.320 --> 1:56:04.960]  change yeah some of them are again the the more British side and the Wall
[1:56:04.960 --> 1:56:08.520]  Street side but they may they may indeed be counterattacked availing forces on
[1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:13.880]  that too so look at the article by Vlad Grinkiewicz on Ria Novosti attacking
[1:56:13.880 --> 1:56:17.840]  Robert Fisk as essentially somebody who's a speaking tube for George Soros
[1:56:17.840 --> 1:56:22.840]  obviously it is impossible for the dollar to remain as the sole reserve
[1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:27.280]  currency that will not work on the other hand most of the other candidates for
[1:56:27.280 --> 1:56:33.480]  this are even less qualified the euro in the end I think are even less able to do
[1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:37.840]  this job than the dollar and the worst of all possible worlds is this idea of a
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:42.760]  synthetic currency the idea that you create a super national currency it
[1:56:42.760 --> 1:56:46.360]  would probably turn out to be special drawing rights of the International
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:51.240]  Monetary Fund that's the worst that is what Lord Keynes wanted at Bretton
[1:56:51.240 --> 1:56:55.640]  Woods Lord Keynes of course spokesman for British imperialism he wanted this
[1:56:55.640 --> 1:57:01.280]  thing called Bankor which would have been a just a strangulation of world
[1:57:01.280 --> 1:57:05.080]  development instead of Bretton Woods that Bretton Woods worked very very well
[1:57:05.080 --> 1:57:12.160]  between 1944 1941 1971 we had the best rates of economic development in world
[1:57:12.160 --> 1:57:16.320]  history before or since we should I think go back to the positive features of
[1:57:16.320 --> 1:57:20.160]  Bretton Woods not all of them but the ones that proved to work well but
[1:57:20.160 --> 1:57:25.120]  certainly no Bankor no special drawing rights no super national currency and
[1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:30.400]  above all watch out for British sabotage as this crisis gets worse all right I
[1:57:30.400 --> 1:57:33.640]  want to talk about how you see this unfolding on the current course that
[1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:38.680]  the establishment has us on what some of those different forces that are moving
[1:57:38.680 --> 1:57:41.840]  towards world government and vertical integration but maybe debating about
[1:57:41.840 --> 1:57:45.680]  who's gonna be on top the pyramid when this all settles we'll talk about the
[1:57:45.680 --> 1:57:50.320]  final timeline and then launch follow the Republic straight ahead the illusion
[1:57:50.320 --> 1:57:54.680]  created by the power elite is a line that covers even the food they want you
