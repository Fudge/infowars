[00:00.000 --> 00:29.720]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show on this November 22, 2015, the 52nd anniversary of the JFK
[00:29.720 --> 00:35.080]  nation that taught many of us a lot that we needed to know about our government and the
[00:35.080 --> 00:40.440]  aftermath, the phony investigation. Of course, that created the term conspiracy theorists.
[00:40.440 --> 00:45.600]  Anyone who questions the government's official story, no matter how impossible or improbable,
[00:45.600 --> 00:52.240]  you are a conspiracy theorist because nobody believed that Lee Harvey Oswald, anybody that
[00:52.240 --> 00:56.720]  looked at the facts, nobody really believed that Lee Harvey Oswald did that by himself.
[00:56.720 --> 01:03.040]  But today, we're going to be talking primarily about the assassination of the West. Our government
[01:03.040 --> 01:10.040]  and people who are running it, the dark side of our government, have created a situation in
[01:10.040 --> 01:16.080]  the Middle East with their Arabic ally like Saudi Arabia. They've created a situation that they're
[01:16.080 --> 01:22.840]  now using to offer us a solution, a solution that will do nothing but pour gasoline on this fire
[01:22.840 --> 01:27.320]  that's going there and the fire that they've started in our own country out of fear and paranoia,
[01:27.320 --> 01:33.000]  uncertainty and doubt. That's what they use to take away your individual liberty. We're going to
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.080]  talk about the state of that today. We're also going to talk with in the second hour a pastor who
[01:38.080 --> 01:44.320]  had a video that went viral talking about discernment. Should we really bring these
[01:44.320 --> 01:50.360]  refugees in? Are we being un-Christian if we refuse to bring in the refugees that we have
[01:50.360 --> 01:57.320]  admittedly created? How do we address this? Now, Donald Trump has an interesting way to address it.
[01:57.320 --> 02:02.680]  And I should say before I tell you what he had to say, that it is now within eight days,
[02:02.680 --> 02:09.640]  we have seen terrorism and concern about terrorism become a top priority for Americans in terms of
[02:09.640 --> 02:13.880]  who they say they want to support for president. And I understand that the entire presidential
[02:13.880 --> 02:21.080]  horse race is a rigged election to get your hopes up that you're going to change something by
[02:21.080 --> 02:25.960]  electing a new dictator. And that's really what these people are running for. You need to be honest
[02:25.960 --> 02:31.840]  about what these people are saying. And I'm going to show you why I say that. But of course,
[02:31.840 --> 02:36.440]  it is a proxy for the issues that we're going to discuss. And so that's why we cover the presidential
[02:36.440 --> 02:40.960]  election to give you a broader understanding of what's going on, but also to talk about these
[02:40.960 --> 02:49.280]  issues and proxy. Now, in these last 10 days or so, since this terrorist event, we have seen concern
[02:49.280 --> 02:56.560]  for terrorism go up to 28% of Americans now calling it their top issue versus 33% who say it's the
[02:56.560 --> 03:01.120]  economy. The economy is always at the top. Remember, it was back during the Clinton administration.
[03:01.120 --> 03:06.240]  It's very true. They said it's the economy, stupid. Focus on the economy. That's what people are
[03:06.240 --> 03:10.640]  always concerned about. But now they're nearly as concerned about terrorism. Understand that
[03:10.640 --> 03:18.880]  war is an economic issue. And so are open borders, importing workers, exporting jobs, massively
[03:19.520 --> 03:24.240]  overloading the welfare state. As at the same time you're creating a warfare state, those are all
[03:24.240 --> 03:28.880]  economic issues. But people are concerned for their immediate safety. They're concerned they're
[03:28.880 --> 03:32.480]  going to be shot down in the theaters and the shopping malls of the streets. And so you have
[03:32.480 --> 03:38.480]  Donald Trump come out. We have an article from Curt Nimmo from a couple of days ago. I want to
[03:38.480 --> 03:44.480]  point out Trump says the surveillance state will combat Islam. Trump said security is going to rule,
[03:44.480 --> 03:48.240]  quote unquote, in a Trump administration. He says we're going to have to do things that we never
[03:48.240 --> 03:52.880]  did before. When he responded, when asked if he would permit the use of warrantless searches at
[03:52.880 --> 03:56.400]  the expense of the Fourth Amendment. He said, and some people are going to be upset about it,
[03:56.400 --> 04:00.880]  but I think that now everybody is feeling that security is going to rule and certain things
[04:00.880 --> 04:06.320]  will be done that we never thought would happen in this country in terms of information and learning
[04:06.320 --> 04:10.640]  about the enemy. So we're going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable
[04:10.640 --> 04:16.000]  a year ago. Now that's pretty scary because there's a lot of stuff that our government has been doing
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.560]  for quite a long time that is unthinkable as far as I'm concerned. And so for somebody to come out,
[04:20.560 --> 04:25.120]  of course, that's the thing about Donald Trump is he's very candid about what he's going to do.
[04:25.120 --> 04:30.880]  He doesn't miss words. He doesn't try to hide his agenda, but it is a scary agenda nevertheless.
[04:30.880 --> 04:37.120]  And understand that when they start to look at the Muslims as people that they need to get this
[04:37.120 --> 04:42.640]  information on, they're going to be coming after you next. Now, when we come back, we're going to
[04:42.640 --> 04:46.240]  talk. At first, we're going to have an announcement from Alex Jones about our Hillary Clinton
[04:46.240 --> 04:52.160]  contest, the Hilarity Clinton contest. You can win $5,000 for first prize. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[04:52.160 --> 05:04.400]  It's election season, a time where we'll soon find out who will be the leader of the free world.
[05:04.400 --> 05:08.240]  Well, in what appears to be a first for a serious presidential contender,
[05:08.240 --> 05:14.160]  Hillary Clinton's campaign is going after the Laugh Factory comedians for making fun of her.
[05:14.160 --> 05:20.080]  A short video of this performance is posted on the website of the renowned comedy club Laugh Factory,
[05:20.080 --> 05:25.760]  and the Clinton campaign has tried to censor it. Besides demanding that the video be taken down,
[05:25.760 --> 05:31.920]  Clinton demanded the personal contact information of the performers that appear in the recording.
[05:31.920 --> 05:35.760]  So what was so crass that the Clinton campaign wants it taken down?
[05:35.760 --> 05:40.560]  Will the skits make fun of Clinton's wardrobe, her age, sexual orientation,
[05:40.560 --> 05:46.160]  the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and the former First Lady's relationship with her famous husband?
[05:46.160 --> 05:50.400]  Basically, what we do here at Infowars every single day. Now, if you want to watch this video
[05:50.400 --> 05:56.160]  for yourself, the Laugh Factory has appropriately titled it Hillary versus the First Amendment.
[05:56.160 --> 05:58.400]  Learn more at infowars.com.
[05:58.400 --> 06:18.880]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[06:22.240 --> 06:25.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back. Thank you so much for joining us. Now,
[06:25.680 --> 06:30.560]  we've seen a lot of attacks on free speech, and everybody knows that I was against the
[06:30.560 --> 06:35.760]  Republicans trying to put, you know, parental warnings on music because it's up to parents
[06:35.760 --> 06:39.120]  to decide what their kids listen to and what they watch. The government shouldn't be involved,
[06:39.120 --> 06:44.800]  and we always said that could lead to censorship. I am not partisan about this. I'm a libertarian.
[06:45.440 --> 06:52.400]  But man, the Democrats have gone like a thousand light years worse trying to ban the terms
[06:52.400 --> 06:57.040]  mother and father or boy or girl because it might hurt a transgendered person.
[06:57.040 --> 07:01.600]  Whoever said that, Jerry Seinfeld and others have come out and said they won't even go
[07:01.600 --> 07:07.040]  to colleges and do their comedy routine because people flip out on them. We have seen
[07:07.920 --> 07:15.280]  so many cases of this where political correctness has become a serious tyranny in this nation,
[07:15.280 --> 07:19.040]  and it's been directed not just in the United States, but in Europe as well,
[07:19.040 --> 07:24.320]  where if you criticize open borders from Syria with all these militants coming in and blowing
[07:24.320 --> 07:30.160]  stuff up, Facebook is shutting you down. The police are even raiding people's houses for
[07:30.160 --> 07:37.520]  their speech. And now Hillary Clinton has sent her campaign and had high level campaign officials
[07:37.520 --> 07:45.600]  call the Laugh Factory undoubtedly the most famous comedy hall, comedy club in the world.
[07:45.600 --> 07:50.320]  I mean, you name it, so many of the greats have come from there. Speaking of, you know, Jerry
[07:50.320 --> 07:54.320]  Seinfeld, his own daughter showed up this year and they said, we're moving back to New York so
[07:54.320 --> 07:59.360]  you can see more boys. She's 14. She said, dad, boys and girls together sexist. Just the word boy
[07:59.360 --> 08:05.840]  and girl is sexist. This is by design. Hillary has had her campaign threatened to quote,
[08:05.840 --> 08:10.160]  bankrupt them, shut them down. You've got to read these articles. Hillary Clinton's Laugh Factory
[08:10.160 --> 08:16.560]  threats. Why did her campaign want comedians, personal contact information so they could threaten
[08:16.560 --> 08:23.920]  them? This is the reality of what's going on and it's getting worse and worse and worse. And if they
[08:23.920 --> 08:29.680]  could shut down comedy, they could shut down any free speech. Going back thousands of years ago
[08:29.680 --> 08:35.840]  in medieval Europe or even Rome, the person that had the most free speech other than the king was
[08:35.840 --> 08:42.400]  the gesture because they could say things nobody else was allowed to. Musicians that would go
[08:42.400 --> 08:48.160]  around and play their, play their three string instruments would also have ballots against
[08:48.160 --> 08:54.400]  corruption. This goes back to the time of Robin Hood. But now Hillary Clinton across the board has
[08:54.400 --> 09:05.040]  said that Bernie Sanders is sexist because Bernie Sanders has criticized her. This is the insanity.
[09:05.040 --> 09:09.920]  So I don't care if you're left, right, center, libertarian, black, white, Jewish, German, Chinese,
[09:09.920 --> 09:17.280]  Mexican or purple. Everyone should see this as a major threat because they are intimidating TV shows,
[09:17.280 --> 09:23.200]  writers, you name it, to self censor, to control what they're saying. And this is the greatest
[09:23.200 --> 09:29.520]  attack I've ever seen on free speech. This is 21st century book burning. In fact, I want to go live
[09:29.520 --> 09:34.560]  and walk around some of the studio and talk about this crap with people because I personally,
[09:34.560 --> 09:39.520]  I personally have had enough of this. I have made it my business to make fun of politicians. I've
[09:39.520 --> 09:44.240]  made it my business too to criticize them and basically call them frauds. When Bush lied about
[09:44.240 --> 09:49.680]  Iraq and WMDs, I called him a piece of crap. I mean, we got him right here as the joker. He's
[09:49.680 --> 09:55.280]  a clown. Will I get shut down? Will I get arrested for this? I mean, if I want to throw darts at a
[09:55.280 --> 09:59.440]  picture of Hillary Clinton, it's my right as an American and as a free person to do it. I mean,
[09:59.440 --> 10:04.400]  here's Barack Obama right here. I got him as a clown. Is that okay with you? It's about being
[10:04.400 --> 10:08.960]  able to make fun of who you want as long as you don't hurt somebody else. Okay? I mean, look at
[10:08.960 --> 10:16.000]  this crap. Look at this. People make fun of Democratic Party, political cartoons. They'll
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.240]  call a bunch of jackasses, call Republicans elephants. That's what it's all about. We have
[10:20.240 --> 10:25.600]  unmasked Hillary Clinton. And if we want to call her a lying demonic corporate witch who helped
[10:25.600 --> 10:29.920]  give the banks unlimited banker bailout money, then you know what? We can do it. You got that,
[10:29.920 --> 10:35.840]  Hillary? We're sick of your crap. Free speech needs to be protected in this nation. If we want to
[10:35.840 --> 10:40.240]  talk bad about the Lord and savior of Barack Obama bought and paid for by crony capitalist,
[10:40.240 --> 10:44.400]  we're going to do it. We're going to do it all we want. And we don't want any harm to come to
[10:44.400 --> 10:48.800]  Obama. That make him a martyr. But we're going to destroy his name and what he stands for and
[10:48.800 --> 10:53.440]  the frauds he pushes. In fact, let's go talk to some more of the crew. I don't even know where I'm
[10:53.440 --> 10:57.120]  going with this other than the fact we're going to resist it. And that's what this comes down to.
[10:57.120 --> 11:01.920]  If you're sick of this crap, then take action yourself and engage in the First Amendment
[11:01.920 --> 11:08.320]  and free speech. We're announcing a $5,000 contest that runs until December 21st. You've
[11:08.320 --> 11:14.720]  got a month to produce a video and upload it on YouTube and one other platform where you make fun
[11:14.720 --> 11:20.320]  of Hillary Clinton and her policies or how she looks or what she stands for or any of it. The
[11:20.320 --> 11:24.880]  truth is with the new media, the system can't control everybody. He wants to have select comedy
[11:24.880 --> 11:30.960]  on Comedy Central with John Stuart, you know, with his fake liberal garbage or with people on
[11:30.960 --> 11:35.600]  Saturday Night Live. But then no one else can engage in it because the political bosses
[11:36.240 --> 11:40.560]  will intimidate you. And that's because they know Hillary is a joke. And she personally,
[11:40.560 --> 11:44.640]  it's been documented, can't handle criticism. Well, she certainly shouldn't be president.
[11:44.640 --> 11:49.120]  I've been made fun of all over Comedy Central. I've been made fun of all over. I love it because
[11:49.120 --> 11:55.360]  people will come find the real me and I will fight to the death for their right on Comedy Central
[11:55.360 --> 12:01.120]  and Bill Maher on HBO to make statements about me that aren't true. To make statements about me
[12:01.120 --> 12:07.040]  saying, Alex Jones thinks cancer is good for you. Wasn't true, but I can now counter them. They're
[12:07.040 --> 12:13.280]  desperate. Let's see. They want to restrict what I have to say. If the left doesn't stand up to
[12:13.280 --> 12:17.440]  this, if the right doesn't stand up to this with the persecution of the Tea Party, the persecution
[12:17.440 --> 12:21.760]  with the IRS of Christian organizations and veterans groups and gun groups, we're going to lose it
[12:21.760 --> 12:26.480]  all. If they would have arrested Michael Moore for his documentary, I would have come out against it.
[12:27.360 --> 12:30.160]  I would have stood for him, but Michael Moore didn't stand up for Dinesh DeSousa,
[12:30.160 --> 12:35.040]  who served nine months in prison because his film was almost as big as Michael Moore's.
[12:35.040 --> 12:40.880]  This is dangerous. This is out of control and it's got to stop. So in the next few hours,
[12:40.880 --> 12:47.360]  it'll be up on infowars.com. We're going to post this video as well so that you can go there,
[12:47.360 --> 12:52.160]  be part of it, make your video, whether it's low tech or high tech, whether it's sophisticated or
[12:52.160 --> 12:56.800]  not. Let's stand up for free speech and free expression or this country's gone. They're getting
[12:56.800 --> 13:00.320]  rid of the 10th Amendment, the 9th Amendment, the 4th Amendment, the 2nd Amendment. They're coming
[13:00.320 --> 13:04.720]  after all of it because it's there to protect us. And once the big multinational corporations with
[13:04.720 --> 13:09.680]  their TPPs and the rest of it get it in place, there's no checks and balances to protect us.
[13:09.680 --> 13:14.720]  And then America is just one more country. The rule book in America, the Bill of Rights,
[13:14.720 --> 13:20.240]  the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence is what makes us special. And this country didn't
[13:20.240 --> 13:25.520]  even have that much resources compared to a Mexico or a continent like Africa. But we became the
[13:25.520 --> 13:30.880]  wealthiest because we had a little bit of freedom. We weren't perfect. I went and saw Tom Hanks movie,
[13:30.880 --> 13:35.120]  Bridge of Spies, and I'm not plagiarizing it because they're plagiarizing just an American
[13:35.120 --> 13:39.680]  statement. He says, hey, to the CIA guy that wants him to violate attorney Klein privilege,
[13:39.680 --> 13:44.080]  he says, you're German, right? You know, Hoffman's your last name. You know, I'm Irish, both sides.
[13:44.080 --> 13:49.040]  But no matter what color we are, where we came from, what makes us American is the rule book.
[13:49.040 --> 13:54.240]  Because if you don't have that rule book, it's just more dirt. And then we're like North Korea.
[13:54.240 --> 13:58.400]  Then there's no floor. There's no ceiling. There's no rule book. There's no rudder. And we're a
[13:58.400 --> 14:05.280]  bunch of slaves. So that's what it comes down to. We are going to play these entries, the good ones,
[14:05.280 --> 14:08.880]  the bad ones and the other ones on the air. We're going to promote these. So regardless,
[14:08.880 --> 14:12.560]  you're going to win being part of this contest, standing up for free speech, standing up and
[14:12.560 --> 14:16.960]  letting them know when they try to silence somebody, when they try to restrict free speech,
[14:16.960 --> 14:21.360]  when they try to shut somebody up, we're all going to stand up together. No matter if it's
[14:21.360 --> 14:26.880]  liberal speech, conservative speech, libertarian speech, communist speech, free market speech,
[14:27.680 --> 14:32.720]  Muslim speech, Christian speech, atheist speech, we're going to stand up for free speech because
[14:32.720 --> 14:37.760]  we are the Renaissance. We are the Enlightenment. We are going to lead the world out of the dark age
[14:37.760 --> 14:42.880]  into some incredible times, but not if they can have this concerted effort to shut everything
[14:42.880 --> 14:48.720]  down. So first prize, 5,000. Second prize, 1,000. Third prize, Hillary for Prison T-shirts from
[14:48.720 --> 14:57.120]  m4store.com and the Hillary laughing pin. Exercise your rights. Light muscles are losing. It's up
[14:57.120 --> 15:01.280]  to you now if you're going to stand up and let this garbage happen. And certainly doing this
[15:01.280 --> 15:06.240]  contest won't save the world, but laying down will ensure we lose. Standing up is the spirit
[15:06.240 --> 15:10.400]  that will spread in the animating contest of liberty and set brush fires in the minds of
[15:10.400 --> 15:15.200]  men and women everywhere to counter this garbage. It's happening in America. They're putting out
[15:15.200 --> 15:19.760]  national polls about arresting people that don't believe in man-made climate change.
[15:20.560 --> 15:26.080]  It's tyranny. It's happening. They're trying to ban brown bags in Seattle saying they're racist.
[15:26.080 --> 15:31.360]  Wake up out of the cult. Wake up out of the trance. Say no. Resist. Take action. I'm Alex Jones
[15:31.360 --> 15:36.480]  signing off for infowars.com. Now get out there and exercise your first amendment and make fun
[15:36.480 --> 15:42.240]  of the witch, Hillary Clinton. Exactly. It's going to be a great contest. I look forward to seeing
[15:42.240 --> 15:46.800]  the entries. It'll be a lot of fun. I'm David Knight. We're here live. We're going to be talking
[15:46.800 --> 15:52.800]  about real threats and perceived headaches. How can you tell the difference? How can you tell
[15:52.800 --> 16:01.360]  what you should really do in response to what we see with terrorism? We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[16:01.360 --> 16:06.320]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[16:06.320 --> 16:11.600]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus. All of our
[16:11.600 --> 16:16.720]  children are hit with modern mind control. Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars,

[19:58.240 --> 20:04.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:28.240 --> 20:31.920]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight, your host. We're here alive and that's
[20:31.920 --> 20:37.760]  the music from Monty Python's Holy Grail. I thought of this when I saw on the Drudge Report
[20:37.760 --> 20:44.560]  this picture of the Iranian guard going after this model of the Al-Aqsa mosque and of course
[20:45.200 --> 20:49.280]  it was straight out of Monty Python. Pull that picture out for people to see this. They had
[20:49.280 --> 20:53.680]  this picture up on the Drudge Report and you see a line of guys, well describe it for people who
[20:53.680 --> 20:58.560]  are listening on the radio, a line of guys walking along with their flag and there's a
[20:58.560 --> 21:04.000]  fake mosque. Now what makes this even funnier is that it's actually a picture of the dome of the
[21:04.000 --> 21:09.440]  rock. They actually built a fake dome of the rock model there and they've got a painted sheet that
[21:09.440 --> 21:13.440]  looks like the wall of the dome of the rock and of course that's the mosque that has the
[21:14.000 --> 21:20.240]  gold dome. It's next to the Al-Aqsa mosque but it isn't the Al-Aqsa mosque and of course that's
[21:20.240 --> 21:25.280]  what they were talking about, simulating the capture of Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque and you
[21:25.280 --> 21:29.040]  can see those people there. And when I looked at that picture I thought okay which one of these
[21:29.040 --> 21:34.960]  guys has the coconuts you know to sound like the horse going on there but it was a perfect metaphor
[21:34.960 --> 21:42.720]  because quite frankly the mindset of the Islamic jihadis is straight out of medieval times. They
[21:42.720 --> 21:49.040]  still see themselves in this fight with the crusaders. That was their their rhetoric when
[21:49.040 --> 21:53.680]  they attacked in Paris of course and if we go down and look at another one of these pictures go down
[21:53.680 --> 22:00.960]  the one where it shows they dropped bombs around this attack, this fake attack of the Al-Aqsa mosque
[22:00.960 --> 22:04.240]  with the dome of the rock. I don't know because they were very confused about that as well just
[22:04.240 --> 22:10.320]  like the Monty Python story. They don't know where they are exactly, what they're looking for exactly
[22:10.320 --> 22:17.440]  and if you look at this picture this is a pullback, a wide angle shot and you can see everything is
[22:17.440 --> 22:23.040]  burned out smoking and desolate except for their little fake model of a mosque right there in
[22:23.040 --> 22:29.360]  the center and I said boy this this says it all. This is the mindset of the jihadi right there.
[22:29.360 --> 22:34.080]  That's a little fake situation they want to create but of course there was a another reminder on the
[22:34.080 --> 22:38.400]  Daily Mail a historian said for centuries Islam and Christianity were locked in a brutal conflict
[22:38.400 --> 22:44.640]  that most have forgotten. The horror a top historian argues is that for jihadis it's as real today as
[22:44.640 --> 22:50.720]  it was in the Middle Ages that's precisely the way they see themselves. France was condemned
[22:50.720 --> 22:56.800]  in their terms they called it the capital of the cross. I mean really does anybody in the west
[22:56.800 --> 23:02.960]  think that Paris is the center of Christianity? Nobody in the right mind would think Paris is
[23:02.960 --> 23:09.120]  a Christian city that embraces Christian values and it is certainly not the capital of the cross
[23:09.120 --> 23:14.240]  whatever they they mean by that. I mean some some people would think the Vatican would be but certainly
[23:14.240 --> 23:20.240]  not Paris. The jihadis see themselves as being engaged in a war as old as Islam itself a struggle
[23:20.240 --> 23:27.120]  for global supremacy against Christianity. And let's understand we talk about the term martyr
[23:27.840 --> 23:34.960]  that's a Greek term it meant witness that's what martyr means witness and of course it became
[23:34.960 --> 23:40.560]  synonymous with religion first with Christianity because the witnesses to what Christ had done
[23:40.560 --> 23:46.880]  were willing to die rather than recant on what they had seen. So they began to call them martyrs
[23:46.880 --> 23:53.520]  because they're witnesses who would not renege on what they knew to be true. And we've gone
[23:53.520 --> 23:58.880]  from somebody who is willing to die for the truth to people now the term martyr becomes people who
[23:58.880 --> 24:05.360]  are willing to kill innocent people to further their violent religion and that's exactly what's
[24:05.360 --> 24:09.840]  going on here but what do we need to be concerned about? We've got a situation now in Brussels
[24:09.840 --> 24:15.440]  where they are have the entire country that the the not the entire country Brussels is a city in
[24:15.440 --> 24:20.720]  Belgium they have the entire city locked down like it was some kind of a school of course they're
[24:20.720 --> 24:25.440]  canceling school and they're going to extend that they've done that for the weekend they're going to
[24:25.440 --> 24:33.600]  extend it to tomorrow. There's a story that was up a couple of days ago Brussels where 500 euros
[24:33.600 --> 24:41.440]  buys a gun in 30 minutes has become Europe's jihadi capital and of course this is the place that
[24:42.400 --> 24:46.560]  our reporters went to and they were essentially told they'd better get out of there they were
[24:46.560 --> 24:53.040]  threatened they're watched people were giving them signs and it is now known that one particular
[24:53.040 --> 24:59.040]  neighborhood especially in the capital city Brussels of Belgium is really jihadi central
[24:59.040 --> 25:04.720]  that's what people are calling it it's a massive number of violent extremists that are there of
[25:04.720 --> 25:09.200]  course you can't call them that if you if you talk about radical Islam of course the there was
[25:09.200 --> 25:14.240]  an exercise of the last democrat debate and all three of the candidates failed they could not
[25:14.240 --> 25:19.200]  pronounce the words radical Islam it just wasn't in their their vocabulary they said that would
[25:19.200 --> 25:24.080]  not be helpful to say that and you have to understand that both in this country with the
[25:24.080 --> 25:29.760]  southern poverty law center and in Europe the think tank there that runs the strong city's
[25:29.760 --> 25:36.080]  network they don't use the term radical Islam either except to talk about the people who use
[25:36.080 --> 25:39.520]  that term are the people that we really need to be afraid of you don't need to be afraid of the
[25:39.520 --> 25:44.320]  radical Islamists you need to be afraid of the people who talk about the radical Islamists those
[25:44.320 --> 25:48.320]  are the ones that need to be watched they need to be censored and ultimately they will need to be
[25:48.320 --> 25:55.120]  arrested and you know when I saw this story I thought about the the campaign that's been conducted
[25:55.120 --> 25:59.760]  beginning last Monday it's almost a week that they've been going with this a lot of major
[25:59.760 --> 26:07.760]  news media outlets including Fox News are telling us that the NRA is out of line to oppose keeping
[26:07.760 --> 26:12.880]  people who are on a government watch list from getting guns say if you're on a government
[26:12.880 --> 26:18.720]  watch list isn't it amazing that people who on a terror watch list can still buy guns and they
[26:18.720 --> 26:23.440]  go back and say well in the last 10 years there's been about 2,000 people who were on the terror
[26:23.440 --> 26:27.440]  watch list that were able to purchase guns well they also had their backgrounds checked didn't they
[26:28.160 --> 26:32.480]  and the question we need to ask is what did they do to get on that list do they know that they're
[26:32.480 --> 26:37.440]  on that list do they have a due process proceeding that's guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment you know
[26:37.440 --> 26:41.520]  there was a thing called the star chamber in England and that's why we have the Sixth Amendment
[26:41.520 --> 26:47.360]  in the star chamber you could be accused and convicted of crimes in a secret proceeding
[26:47.360 --> 26:52.880]  that you knew nothing about now we have that we have the files of court that allows dragnet
[26:52.880 --> 26:59.520]  surveillance of the United States but we also have these things called watch lists or no fly lists
[26:59.520 --> 27:03.840]  and if you're put on that you don't know that you're put on they don't tell you until you're
[27:03.840 --> 27:09.280]  blocked from doing anything when you look at these watch lists the no fly lists the NDA
[27:09.280 --> 27:14.880]  a indefinite detention without trial that was put in by Obama a couple of years ago
[27:15.440 --> 27:20.880]  we should be very concerned about that not about people who were vetted who had a background check
[27:20.880 --> 27:26.560]  for real and were allowed to buy a gun none of those people ever committed a terrorist attack
[27:26.560 --> 27:30.320]  that's what fox news won't tell you that's what the new york daily news won't tell you but they
[27:30.320 --> 27:36.320]  show pictures of daily news shows pictures of wane lop here with the nra saying this is a jihadi
[27:36.320 --> 27:42.400]  extremists say they're the dangerous people the craziest man on earth they put another picture of
[27:42.400 --> 27:46.720]  the head of the nra up and called him the craziest man on earth because he thinks that we have
[27:46.720 --> 27:51.360]  something called a constitution that you should be confronted with your accusers that you should
[27:51.360 --> 27:57.920]  have a public trial that you should have witnesses that you can cross examine with a lawyer representing
[27:57.920 --> 28:04.320]  you or do it yourself that's a dangerous idea in this day and age and so as the first amendment
[28:04.320 --> 28:07.680]  we have people who are coming out against the first amendment we'll talk about this one of
[28:07.680 --> 28:12.160]  the things that i find the most dangerous about this is a reaction of some of our top politicians
[28:12.160 --> 28:19.360]  you know until just recently ben carson was the second in the polls of course donald trump has
[28:19.360 --> 28:25.760]  ben and still is the first and so when trump reacted to islam and he says security is going to rule
[28:25.760 --> 28:30.800]  quote unquote security is going to rule under a trump administration and then you had ben
[28:30.800 --> 28:36.880]  carson come back and say i hope we have a database on everybody if we don't we're not doing a good
[28:36.880 --> 28:43.280]  job say we should be very concerned about that mindset when we come back we're going to talk
[28:43.280 --> 28:48.320]  about addressing the real problem instead of addressing a phony problem we do have some real
[28:48.320 --> 28:53.440]  problems we're going to talk about that when we come back stay with us

[33:45.440 --> 33:52.160]  about islam you know we looked at this picture of these clowns uh out there in iran talking about
[33:52.160 --> 33:57.040]  how they were going to attack and take over the alexa mosque but they were actually even fighting
[33:57.040 --> 34:02.240]  against a mock-up of the dome of the rock uh how ridiculous that was how much that looked like a
[34:02.240 --> 34:09.040]  money python holy grail episode but there are real dangers of course we saw what happened in paris
[34:09.040 --> 34:14.800]  people really died there a lot of people died there there's also this story uh from friday
[34:14.800 --> 34:19.520]  muslims attack a christian with a pickaxe for leaving islam that kit daniels had and this was
[34:19.520 --> 34:24.640]  in britain a former muslim attacked with a pickaxe handle because he converted to christianity
[34:24.640 --> 34:30.800]  it's 49 years old he had a broken kneecap a fractured forearm a concussion after hooded muslims punched
[34:30.800 --> 34:36.560]  kicked him struck him with a pickaxe handle outside of his home now he was somebody who had
[34:36.560 --> 34:41.520]  been in a documentary talking about how he had converted from islam to christianity and since
[34:41.520 --> 34:48.880]  that 2008 documentary he has been the focus of attacks from muslims and britain uh since it was
[34:48.880 --> 34:52.960]  released he and his family have suffered thousands of dollars worth of damage to their vehicles to
[34:52.960 --> 34:58.000]  their property and then they beat him in this video that you can see right there and of course the
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.480]  comment that kit had and it's a good comment this incident is what happens when a country not only
[35:02.480 --> 35:07.680]  prevents citizens from using guns for self-defense but rolls out the red carpet for radical extremists
[35:07.680 --> 35:14.320]  to flood the country so we look at this attack on the phony mosque and these guys running around
[35:14.320 --> 35:18.960]  with flags and handles and presumably uh some partners they're banging coconuts together to
[35:18.960 --> 35:24.560]  sound like horses when you look at that it is laughable that's the state of the iranian army
[35:24.560 --> 35:30.480]  they we don't have anything to worry about from the iranian army but we do have a lot to worry
[35:30.480 --> 35:36.880]  about from a massive influx of migrants that we cannot and are not even interested in vetting
[35:36.880 --> 35:42.480]  because that is what we can bring upon ourselves if we do this if we follow the same course that
[35:42.480 --> 35:48.640]  europe has and of course obama is talking about that's exactly what he wants to do isis remember
[35:48.640 --> 35:53.120]  said that there are 4 000 jihadis in europe that's a very believable number there have been five
[35:53.120 --> 35:59.200]  million people that they brought in as quote-unquote refugees now that would mean that that was only
[35:59.200 --> 36:07.120]  eight tenths of one percent of those refugees that came in that would be jihadis if only
[36:07.120 --> 36:13.200]  eight tenths of one percent of them were jihadis then they would have four thousand not a half
[36:13.200 --> 36:18.480]  dozen like attacked paris but four thousand throughout europe that's something for us all
[36:18.480 --> 36:21.760]  to be concerned about that's something we need to be concerned about here in america as well
[36:21.760 --> 36:26.480]  so they bring up these situations say don't be worried about this thing over here which is a
[36:26.480 --> 36:32.240]  real threat bringing massive numbers of people we don't know who they are in areas that we have
[36:32.240 --> 36:39.440]  basically kicked the anthill repeatedly obama's foreign policy drone assassinations invasions
[36:39.440 --> 36:44.880]  bombings of areas to make the people hate us and then bring them in here saying that they're
[36:44.880 --> 36:50.160]  refugees why don't we just stop that but instead of stopping that we are offered phony solutions
[36:50.160 --> 36:53.680]  that are going to only make things worse i've mentioned a couple of times what donald trump
[36:53.680 --> 36:58.080]  says he would do with the surveillance state he would ramp it up and he would say uh we're
[36:58.080 --> 37:03.200]  going to do things that were frankly unthinkable a few years ago yeah i'm sure we will whether he
[37:03.200 --> 37:08.160]  is president or whether somebody else is president uh they all seem to be going down this same path
[37:08.720 --> 37:14.480]  except for rand paul i mentioned that uh ben karson got his licks in there too not wanting
[37:14.480 --> 37:18.880]  to look weak he said yeah we hopefully we have a database on every citizen who was already here
[37:18.880 --> 37:25.360]  here yeah ben they do they do have a database on every one of us and i've got a problem with that
[37:25.360 --> 37:30.320]  and i've got a problem with people like ben karson and donald trump who cheerlead for that
[37:30.880 --> 37:35.120]  who say we're going to have to have special ids understand the republican party has been trying
[37:35.120 --> 37:41.200]  to sell the idea of a national id card a biometric id card they can track everybody what they've
[37:41.200 --> 37:45.920]  been trying to sell that for a very long time usually using uh open borders usually using
[37:45.920 --> 37:51.520]  illegal immigrants to sell that idea they're trying to sell the republicans are now trying to sell
[37:51.520 --> 37:59.040]  in some corners gun control based on the fear of uh people on a terror watch list never talking about
[37:59.040 --> 38:04.560]  how anybody gets on a secret watch list how you get off of it where's your due process they always
[38:04.560 --> 38:09.680]  create a problem then they offer us a solution that only makes things worse that doesn't even
[38:09.680 --> 38:15.600]  address the root cause of the problem rand paul however did address the root cause of the problem
[38:15.600 --> 38:21.520]  he seems to be the only one to really understand what is going on here and this article from
[38:21.520 --> 38:26.000]  steve watson rand paul said cut off arms sales to saudis until they take in the refugees he said
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.040]  the gulf state support gasoline on the fire they have not taken in a single refugee and here's
[38:31.040 --> 38:35.520]  what he had to say he said one of the biggest supporters of suny terrorism in the world is
[38:35.520 --> 38:41.920]  saudi arabia katar is up there ua e is up there sometimes government sometimes private donors
[38:41.920 --> 38:47.760]  what i would say is no more sales of any arms to these countries until they start accepting
[38:47.760 --> 38:53.520]  refugees yeah exactly where's their compassion we are shamed we're called racist we're called
[38:54.080 --> 39:00.640]  un christian people we're told we have absolutely no compassion if we don't want to open our borders
[39:00.640 --> 39:06.080]  to the refugees that obama's foreign policy is creating more of every day and of course the foreign
[39:06.080 --> 39:12.080]  policy of our arab allies in the area people like saudi arabia so instead of stopping the war
[39:12.640 --> 39:20.080]  we need to flood our country with refugees that do not want to assimilate that is nothing short of
[39:20.080 --> 39:25.920]  an invasion now rand paul also had this to say he said you don't have the right to be an american
[39:25.920 --> 39:34.000]  citizen that's important to say we need to underscore that it says if today out of political
[39:34.000 --> 39:39.520]  correctness we're told that everybody in the world has the right to be an american citizen
[39:39.520 --> 39:44.320]  no you don't you don't have a right to be an american citizen you don't have a right to a
[39:44.320 --> 39:49.280]  free education at the expense of people who are american citizens who are american taxpayers
[39:49.920 --> 39:54.720]  we need to say that loudly and clearly and finally somebody did rand paul did he said most people
[39:54.720 --> 40:01.520]  don't realize this but refugees who come here and they're immediately put on welfare precisely
[40:01.520 --> 40:06.640]  and he says there will always be those who advocate giving up liberty in exchange for somehow
[40:06.640 --> 40:11.840]  getting more security but what we found is when we've allowed warrantless searches we didn't catch
[40:11.840 --> 40:18.800]  any terrorists exactly and of course the people who are saying that are the rest of the gop field
[40:18.800 --> 40:24.160]  and the rest of the democrats who are saying this he's the only candidate who's running for president
[40:24.160 --> 40:29.600]  that is telling people the truth and so who is really sponsoring isis this article by michael
[40:29.600 --> 40:35.040]  kriger that came out today he breaks that down in detail yes it is our allies it is saudi arabia
[40:35.040 --> 40:40.560]  it is turkey it is other arab allies and he points out this he says with the way the french
[40:40.560 --> 40:45.440]  government is cracking down on civil liberties of his own citizens you'd think the general public
[40:45.440 --> 40:50.880]  were the ones who were supporting and funding isis as opposed to the french government's allies
[40:50.880 --> 40:56.400]  who are the ones who are actually supporting isis you understand we have our own governments who
[40:56.400 --> 41:04.080]  are and our allies quote-unquote who are funding these wars who are funding isis as their jihadi
[41:04.080 --> 41:09.440]  surrogates and yet they crack down on us that's precisely what's going on in brussels where they
[41:09.440 --> 41:14.960]  have the entire city locked down for this weekend they're going to be extending it to tomorrow they're
[41:14.960 --> 41:19.840]  going to be closing schools universities kindergartens the metro will be shuttered all weekend they
[41:19.840 --> 41:24.720]  will remain closed for the beginning of the week we don't know how long that's going to be
[41:24.720 --> 41:31.200]  because now they've got everybody truly afraid now they can just say we saw a terrorist somewhere
[41:31.200 --> 41:37.440]  whether they did or not and they can lock down an entire city that's precisely where the governments
[41:37.440 --> 41:42.720]  want to be they want you to be so afraid that they can lock you down that they can declare
[41:42.720 --> 41:48.880]  martial law at any point in time and that's what we are witnessing now in europe an australian
[41:48.880 --> 41:55.200]  politician said don't adopt our gun control laws we are a nation of victims you cannot own a gun
[41:55.200 --> 42:00.560]  for self-defense but the criminals of course still have guns and that's what we see at the epicenter
[42:00.560 --> 42:05.760]  of the european jihadis and of course that is brussels and in particular one neighborhood in
[42:05.760 --> 42:11.840]  brussels where joe biggs and um michael zimmerman went to film that's the mollambique neighborhood
[42:11.840 --> 42:17.520]  that neighborhood has been the heart of a thriving black market where a high powered weapon can be
[42:17.520 --> 42:24.720]  bought in record time and this is a story from uh courts they say that uh for anywhere from five
[42:24.720 --> 42:28.960]  hundred thirty five us dollars to a thousand us dollars you can get a military weapon in half an
[42:28.960 --> 42:35.920]  hour so you don't need to have background checks if you're a criminal background checks criminals
[42:35.920 --> 42:40.560]  don't use the background check process that's why the two thousand people that fox news wants you
[42:40.560 --> 42:45.280]  to be so afraid about that we're on a secret watch list that's why none of them were engaging in
[42:45.280 --> 42:51.760]  terrorist attacks because criminals and terrorists don't use gun laws gun prohibition doesn't affect
[42:51.760 --> 42:55.600]  them stay with us we're going to be right back and we're going to be talking to a pastor who's
[42:55.600 --> 42:59.920]  going to talk about the moral issues with this refugee crisis when cells become toxic they die

[50:28.720 --> 50:35.680]  in europe with the terrorist attack this last week that has gone to nearly a tie with the economy in
[50:35.680 --> 50:40.720]  terms of the concern of voters as to what their top issue is and of course it has pushed things
[50:40.720 --> 50:46.640]  like the globalist climate treaty that is coming up let's push that off of the front pages if it
[50:46.640 --> 50:52.400]  wasn't even ever really there as far as the mainstream media goes but it is focusing everybody's
[50:52.400 --> 50:59.280]  attention away from that away from the secret trade treaties that would also usher in globalism
[50:59.280 --> 51:04.880]  that's what we need to be concerned about really in the long term view that is the thing that people
[51:04.880 --> 51:09.840]  need to really understand the damage that is going to be done to us in our economy by both
[51:09.840 --> 51:15.440]  of those treaties and also the international mechanisms that this sets up for multinational
[51:15.440 --> 51:19.680]  government but of course those issues have been pushed to the side and of course we don't want to
[51:19.680 --> 51:25.520]  talk about how we really started those wars who's really supporting isis who is on isis's side of
[51:25.520 --> 51:32.800]  course as putin has attacked isis in syria it has made it even more obvious to people who are paying
[51:32.800 --> 51:38.320]  attention that we are supporting them but michael krueger has a very good story today he's talking
[51:38.320 --> 51:45.120]  about the real allies of isis and he points out that france is bringing in new legislation
[51:45.120 --> 51:50.720]  extending the temporary state of emergency now to three months we've got brussels has
[51:50.720 --> 51:55.520]  been locked down this entire weekend and they're still extending it for a manhunt these new laws
[51:55.520 --> 52:01.120]  will grant authorities to new powers to carry out search and seizure of devices to also block
[52:01.120 --> 52:09.200]  websites but the reality is he points out that it's turkey and our arab allies in the gulf states
[52:09.200 --> 52:14.320]  that are the real players behind isis and you're not going to hear anything about that in most
[52:14.320 --> 52:21.040]  places they had the turkish newspaper today's zamen pointed out that more than 100 000 fake turkish
[52:21.040 --> 52:28.880]  passports have been given to isis and they have been turning a blind eye to the fact that turkey
[52:28.880 --> 52:36.080]  is the major consumer of oil from the isis oil fields giving them an immense financial aid not
[52:36.080 --> 52:41.120]  having an economic blockade of isis we would never do that would we i mean we have economic blockades
[52:41.120 --> 52:47.360]  of our enemies in a heartbeat we create no fly zones but not for isis for isis they trade with
[52:47.360 --> 52:51.920]  them they trade with the enemy they give them a massive amount of money and if you look at the
[52:51.920 --> 52:59.120]  map you can see that isis is coming down from the border with syria and turkey flowing down like
[52:59.120 --> 53:07.120]  tentacles into syria going through the Kurdish area through the ppk fighting them as well because
[53:07.120 --> 53:13.760]  turkey doesn't like them this is a surrogate fighting force for turkey for nato for the cia
[53:13.760 --> 53:18.320]  they go on to point out the former isis fighter told newsweek that turkey was allowing isis trucks
[53:18.320 --> 53:23.760]  to cross the border he said isis militants would travel freely through turkey and a convoy of
[53:23.760 --> 53:28.560]  trucks and they would stop at safe houses along the way isis commanders told us to fear nothing at
[53:28.560 --> 53:35.760]  all because there was full cooperation with the turks meanwhile nato leaders feign outrage and
[53:35.760 --> 53:41.360]  learned liberal pundits and i would say not only just liberal pundits but also conservative pundits
[53:41.360 --> 53:46.160]  and not only pundits but presidential candidates continue to scratch their heads and be wilderness
[53:46.160 --> 53:52.320]  as to isis's extraordinary resilience and their inexorable expansion how could this be how could
[53:52.320 --> 53:57.680]  this little force be so resilient how could they be expanding everywhere because we're arming them
[53:58.240 --> 54:03.200]  and because we don't want the russians to attack them it couldn't be more obvious we've even had
[54:03.200 --> 54:08.960]  congressional testimony goes back to september 2014 where general martin dempsi was asked by
[54:08.960 --> 54:14.880]  senator lindsay graham whether he knew of any major arab ally that embraced isle and general
[54:14.880 --> 54:22.080]  dempsi says i know major arab allies who funded them of course we all know this is the open secret
[54:22.080 --> 54:29.600]  that the mainstream media won't talk about but if we say that we don't want to bring in unvetted
[54:29.600 --> 54:35.600]  refugees into the united states as obama does then we're told that we're helping isle this is what
[54:35.600 --> 54:41.440]  obama said today in an article that's up on info wars dot com obama says g.o.p attacks on refugees
[54:41.440 --> 54:51.040]  help isle no actually it's obama's drone attacks on these nations that helps isis he says prejudice
[54:51.040 --> 54:58.080]  and discrimination help isle and undermine our national security no it's actually murder assassination
[54:58.080 --> 55:05.200]  invasion and war that undermine our security and obama has done that as much or more than any
[55:05.200 --> 55:12.400]  republican it's not prejudice and discrimination that is behind this now in the next hour we're
[55:12.400 --> 55:18.160]  going to be joined by a pastor who had a video that went viral talking about this talking about
[55:18.160 --> 55:24.000]  the sermon understanding what the real risks to us are and i as i pointed out earlier in the show
[55:24.000 --> 55:32.560]  when we showed that comical farce that was the the training to take over the al-Aqsa mosque in
[55:32.560 --> 55:37.920]  israel that we saw the iranian people doing i said you know that is not a threat to us
[55:38.480 --> 55:43.600]  it's not even a threat to israel we need to understand though that bringing these people in
[55:43.600 --> 55:51.360]  by the millions is truly a threat to us it truly is a way to erase our culture when we say that
[55:51.360 --> 55:54.960]  we're called races we're called xenophobes or whatever let me understand let me
[55:54.960 --> 56:01.280]  point out that islam is not a race syria is not a race okay the bible talks about nations tongues
[56:01.280 --> 56:07.840]  and tribes this is about cultures whose culture is going to be dominant and the muslims make no
[56:07.840 --> 56:14.160]  bones about the fact that they want their culture to be dominant we have a article on the washington
[56:14.160 --> 56:20.000]  post that just came out yesterday in the first majority muslim us city residents are tense
[56:20.000 --> 56:27.600]  about its future and this is a city in michigan ham tramac michigan that's a suburb of detroit
[56:27.600 --> 56:31.920]  they say earlier this month the blue collar city that has been home to polish catholic immigrants
[56:31.920 --> 56:36.000]  and their descendants for more than a century became what demographers think is the first
[56:36.000 --> 56:41.760]  jurisdiction in the nation to elect a majority muslim council now they point out that this has
[56:41.760 --> 56:47.760]  had some real concrete changes we're told that if you're concerned about syria law being established
[56:47.760 --> 56:54.480]  by muslim majorities you're a xenophobe you're an islamophobe but for one example you cannot get
[56:54.480 --> 57:00.480]  a liquor license within 500 feet of the four mosques that are in the town this tiny town
[57:01.120 --> 57:06.880]  so they have already enacted laws to prohibit the sale of alcohol within a certain distance
[57:06.880 --> 57:12.320]  from their mosques they're also having calls to prayer that are very loud some of them starting
[57:12.320 --> 57:17.360]  at 6 a.m in the morning and as one lady said look i've got no fight with these people but
[57:17.360 --> 57:23.760]  they're doing this for a reason they're pushing this into our faces and that's precisely what
[57:23.760 --> 57:28.000]  they're doing they say i don't know why people keep putting religion into politics while they're
[57:28.000 --> 57:33.760]  putting their religion into the zoning laws they're telling people you cannot buy alcohol in this
[57:33.760 --> 57:37.600]  area whatever else they want to do that is the beginning of it when we come back in the next
[57:37.600 --> 57:42.640]  hour we're going to talk to a pastor to help us get some discernment as to what's really going on
[57:42.640 --> 57:50.880]  here in this clash of cultures we'll be right back when cells become toxic they die early and aging

[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:18.640]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host on this sunday november 22nd
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:26.400]  2015 i was just pointing out in the last segment washington post ran an article about the first
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:35.600]  muslim majority run us city the first one to have a majority muslim city council this city is
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:42.400]  ham tramac just outside of detroit and they talk to the mayor who herself uh come her family came
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.960]  from poland in the early 20th century most of the people who were there previously were polish
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:51.760]  catholics and she said people are constantly coming by they're concerned about what's happening
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:57.200]  to their community it is fundamentally changing it goes with this article that we see on a bright
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:02.160]  part majority of americans feel like strangers in their own country they say whatever failings
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:07.520]  there may be in his specific policies donald trump's campaign has tapped into a strong visceral
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.720]  feeling of millions of americans seeking to destroy trump the candidate may further alienate
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:18.160]  republicans in the party the mainstream party from a rapidly growing block of voters and they
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:23.840]  point out that 58 percent of americans say they don't identify with what america has become wait
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:30.400]  until they bring in millions of refugees and those are going to be anchor refugees who will
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:36.640]  even if they're not violent extremists they will bring in their families their children it will
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:42.400]  they will essentially become anchor men not anchor babies but anchor men to bring in an
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:48.880]  extended family it is going to multiply very very rapidly you will not recognize america if you
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:54.160]  think it looks strange now if 58 percent of the people feel that way wait till you see what happens
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:02:02.080]  if obama is allowed to bring in a massive wave of migrants now they point out that even 45 percent
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:08.560]  of democrats share this feeling uh is 58 percent of americans overall but 45 percent of democrats
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:14.960]  who say that they uh don't have any that they don't feel at home in america this it feels
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.440]  strange to them and they say the point of this the the reasons for their their alienation
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:24.880]  are cultural and economic let's talk about the cultural issues here because that's precisely
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:30.640]  what's going on in this city where the majority of people have elected a muslim leadership there
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:36.240]  and the majority of the people now are muslims now this mayor majuski who her family came from
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:42.240]  poland she's talking about the fact that they have now enacted laws that would prohibit getting
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:49.520]  liquor licenses within a certain distance of mosques they also are allowing the mosques to uh
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:55.280]  have a loud issue call to prayers they have the uh the prayers are put over loudspeakers
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:00.960]  five times a day the first time begins at six a.m. in the morning and she says you know it's about
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:06.320]  culture it's about what kind of place hemtremic will become there's definitely a fear and to some
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:12.800]  degree i share it and then they talk about this 28 year old uh immigrant from yemen typical of the
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:17.760]  migrants that uh obama wants to bring in just got elected he says i don't know why people
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:22.240]  keep putting religion into politics well they put it their religion into the zoning laws
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:27.760]  and they point out that the polish catholic population has shrunk from 90 percent of this
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:34.720]  small town in 1970 to 11 percent today and one of the mosque leaders said this in case you think
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:39.200]  we're being paranoid in case you think we're being xenophobic this is what one of the mosque
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:44.400]  leaders said according to the washington post he said the polish people here think we are invading
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:51.440]  them we were a big threat to their religion and culture now their days are gone you understand
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:58.800]  that now their days are gone they see themselves here to replace us and i'm reminded of what
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:05.360]  bobby jendall said i think it was his best contribution to the campaign when he said immigration
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.400]  without assimilation is invasion the people who are being brought in here whether they're
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:15.120]  refugees whether jihadis whether they are coming here for economic reasons whether they are
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:23.680]  part of a cultural invasion that is deliberate to turn america into an islamic culture they are
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:29.520]  very clear that they don't want to assimilate and if you come here without an intention of
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:35.520]  assimilating if you come here to set up a different culture an opposition to the existing culture that
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:42.880]  is quite simply an invasion now is it un christian to say that is it racist to say that we're going
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:48.480]  to talk to a pastor in the next segment darrell rundus who had a video that i think rightly breaks
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:55.120]  this down he's going to explain us explain to us what discretion is and he's going to address people
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:05:01.280]  who say this is racist we'll be right back with that pastor when cells become toxic they die early
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:06.960]  and aging sets in no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health nerve
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:12.720]  growth factors and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time just one of the key compounds
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:18.160]  bio pqq is backed by major clinical studies you want the best that's out there at the lowest price

[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:07.840]  started we don't think that's the right way to handle it and we're told then that we are racist

[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:10.400]  illustrate here you know they they look at the bible and they don't see a thing right but uh
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:16.160]  there's a lot of fans of jesus out there well-intending ones that uh aren't truly followers of jesus and
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:20.560]  they read the bible because they know they should and they don't see anything i mean it's just boring
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:25.360]  drab and dry but the true christian you know they read the bible it's the it's god's word it's their
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:32.000]  authority and it comes into life in living color so um i do that because you know once again i don't
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.920]  care what you think about christians or or the bible but that's we're going to talk a lot about
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:41.840]  about what the bible says tonight and uh no matter what you think you know it's been tried and true
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:47.120]  and proven there's lots of wisdom to be found in its pages so with that said let me just put a
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:52.000]  tea like this i did a video that said love your enemies you know because you hear a lot of people
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.560]  say well we've got to love these poor orphans and widows and we've got to take care of them we
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:02.240]  got to let these refugees in it's unloving you know to call yourself a christian and not help these
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:07.120]  people and so it caused me to go a little deeper in god's word and start to look up you know what
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:11.920]  does it really mean to love your enemies what did jesus do you know it's not enough to say
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:16.640]  what would he do you know that leaves it open for speculation you go to god's word you start to read
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:21.440]  and what you what you discover first and foremost and i think what was most controversial is i
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:28.000]  i defined the word enemy and if you go to any concordians and you look at the word enemy as used
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.920]  by jesus and love your enemies or as james puts it to be anybody that's friends with a world makes
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:39.680]  themselves an enemy of god and so on um what you discover is that word enemy doesn't mean someone
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:44.000]  you're at battle with or somebody that wants to kill you or cut your head off or that wants to
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.480]  rape your women or marry your you know 11 year old daughter um what it means are people that are
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:54.400]  in this deal with god through their wicked words in other words sinners people that are lost that
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:10:00.400]  have rejected jesus god the bible etc so nowhere in the bible will you ever see jesus purposely
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:06.800]  put himself or others in harm's way in order to call you know to go help other people or to fulfill
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:11.840]  his ministry in fact i would challenge anybody christian or not to go through scripture and see
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:18.000]  in john six seven eight nine there's several examples where the jews hated the things jesus
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.200]  had just mentioned to them called them sons of hell brutal vipers hypocrites and and so on
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:27.440]  they got so angry with them david they wanted to kill them right and i think that seems very
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:32.000]  similar to kind of what we're dealing with today and yet over and over what we see is an example
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.680]  where it says jesus no longer walked amongst the jews because he knew they sought to kill him so he
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:44.720]  purposely avoided uh putting himself or even others in harm's way in order to do good you know
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:48.480]  darrell i think that's a lesson even for people who aren't christians when they look at this when
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:53.440]  i look at there's a lot of people out there especially uh in the liberal institutions and
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:11:02.000]  in europe who i see them as pushing this in a way saying you have to be you're intolerant if you
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.640]  don't bring all these people in but what they're going to do in the name of political correctness
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:12.960]  in the name of tolerance is to create and establish a completely intolerant society
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:17.600]  wherever islam has set up they're completely intolerant of everyone else it is the most
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:21.520]  intolerant of all the cultures of all the religions of any differences in it and so
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:27.680]  that's to me is is is the irony i see these self-loathing liberals who want to see with other
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:33.440]  people who you know whether it be same-sex marriage or the lbgt community and they attack christians
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:38.240]  calling them intolerant and bigots and unloving and so on they love to call them names but the
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:43.360]  truth of the matter is when it comes to these refugees i'm not saying hey we shouldn't love them
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:46.960]  we shouldn't take care of them we shouldn't help them i mean the truth of the matter is
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:54.560]  america because it was founded in judeo christian concepts and beliefs has done far more in the way
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:58.880]  of helping others than any other country then probably all of the other countries combined
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:04.720]  and so for anybody to say we're being unloving unkind because we want to also love others as
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:10.240]  we love ourselves and not put them in harm's way is just hypocrisy in fact paul talks in
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:15.200]  romans 12 about when you love don't love with hypocrisy now most people read that and think
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.360]  well that means if i say david i love you i care about you and then i go talk bad about you behind
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:24.800]  your back or i make promises to you that i'll help in and i don't that would be love with hypocrisy
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.840]  right but if you really you know and it does mean that as well but if you look at it even deeper
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:36.000]  love with hypocrisy since love does no harm to its neighbor would be like me saying i want a minister
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.840]  to which i commonly do uh to let's say some pedophile and he's a known pedophile he's hurt
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.480]  many children but i don't want to offend the guy i don't want to you know call him a pedophile i don't
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:50.800]  want to tell other people he's a pedophile but i love him and i care for him so i want a minister
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.360]  to him i want to help him i want to feed him well if i invite him into my home and i put my own
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:00.640]  wife and kids in harm's way in order to try to love him that would be love with hypocrisy
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:06.080]  i'm charged by god first and foremost to be the provider and the protector of my own wife and kids
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:11.040]  and exactly my neighbors i love myself i'm not purposely going to put them in harm's way
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:16.800]  in order to go do good for someone else and then call that love that's not love that's called vanity
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:21.360]  that's people trying to do good works to impress god or to impress their neighbors
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:27.280]  while giving no regard to the welfare of other people that it may harm that's a great analogy
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:30.640]  saying that you're going to help someone who's a pedophile to try to overcome this but of course
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:35.920]  in doing that you're going to bring them into your home putting your family your children at risk
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:40.800]  at the same time perfect analogy you know daryl when we look at this and of course so i want to
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:46.480]  play a clip from hillary clinton uh it's a it's a short clip she's very well acquainted with
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:52.240]  sol linsky's rules for radicals and rule number four is to make the enemy live up to his rulebook
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:56.240]  that's why you're seeing people coming out of the woodwork saying these christians are being
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:02.000]  un christian when they don't want to do what we say is the only solution they only offer you
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:08.560]  one solution that's another tactic uh give give you one solution and that has to be the only way
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:13.600]  to deal with the problem which in most cases they created let's play uh clinton's uh comments real
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:19.120]  quick and i'll get your uh comments on that when we come back it's important that we don't listen
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:25.440]  to the voices including those coming from republican candidates for president who would paint with such
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:37.760]  a broad brush would want us to somehow isolate register muslims go after islam our enemy are
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:45.600]  these criminal killers who misuse a religion in order to recruit people and give them the training
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:51.360]  to go out and kill more people we know how to vet refugees we've been doing it for years it takes a
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:15:01.920]  long time i will make sure that we are absolutely vigilant in how we vet any refugees and we will
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:09.920]  not be allowing people in who if anyone thinks at all they could cause us a problem i will rely on
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:14.960]  the defense and the intelligence experts to do that we don't want to enhance the recruitment
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:23.280]  of isis and the others by acting like we're going to shut our borders because that validates them
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:31.600]  them and that then creates more opportunity unfortunately to pull in vulnerable people
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:36.320]  i don't know really how closing the borders and saying we're not going to bring in people
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:41.040]  really validates them and of course we come back i want to get your comments on that daryl what she
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:46.160]  just had to say of course how are we going to vet them these people who came in uh that were
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:50.160]  part of the terrorist attacks in uh in paris they're watched for quite a long time they didn't
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:55.600]  vet them we'll be right back stay with us

[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:42.480]  daryl rundus is a pastor from dalas who put out a video directly addressing the claims by many
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:49.520]  people that not accepting endless numbers of muslim migrants that are not going to be vetted
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:56.480]  out of these warthorn areas is somehow lacking in compassion it's un christian it's racist and so he
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:01.920]  put out a video addressing that very issue now if you don't agree with that we want to take your
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:05.360]  calls and put you at the very front of the list we're going to take calls from people who want
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:10.720]  to comment about that who have questions about what a christian should do or what a non christian
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:17.200]  should do let's take your calls it's 877-789-2539 it's a different number on sunday's again that's

[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:30.160]  if you think that we ought to open the borders and bring people in that failing to do that
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:35.680]  is lacking christian compassion or lacking even secular compassion that it is racist not to do
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:39.840]  that we just heard from hillary clinton she was saying that we're going to vet these people and
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:46.400]  of course that isn't really the case is it as we know from a roiders article that just came out
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:50.160]  today they say authorities missed many red flags before the pair shootings they go through many of
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:54.000]  these red flags that were missed they said there are multiple chances to stop the men who attacked
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.600]  paris yet during questioning in belgium many of these people that they knew that they had
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:04.320]  islamic state sympathies they thought they had connections to syria so they brought them in
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:09.840]  for questioning and when they brought them in they said no no we are not the droids you're looking
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:14.960]  for and so they let them go that's how they vet them how else are they going to vet them
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:19.200]  they don't have a database of these people in those countries they don't know who is who
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:25.680]  and most of these people that are coming in are single men between the ages of 25 and 35 military
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:32.560]  age jihadis people who rightfully are probably upset about the fact that we have fermented rebellion
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:38.240]  and invasion in their countries and yet we're told the solution is not to stop saudi arabia
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:43.920]  from attacking from attacking and funding these surrogates or directly attacking yemen have you
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:49.040]  heard anybody complaining about the refugees out of yemen the humanitarian crisis there no
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:54.480]  of course not because saudi arabia is our ally we're not allowed to criticize saudi arabia we're
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:59.440]  also not allowed to say the Saudis ought to take these refugees that's what rand paul and others
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:05.520]  have said have these people step up to the plate and let them take some of these refugees that

[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:08.880]  is a pastor who had a video that went viral talking about the issue whether or not we should
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:16.000]  open our doors to unlimited amounts of migrants do they represent a danger to us
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:21.360]  how do we how do we handle this as christians what are we called to do is this something
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:26.480]  that we're doing that endangers us endangers our families is this the wisest way is it the only way
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:31.920]  to handle this dare in your comments on what hillary clinton just said in that clip we played in the
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:36.400]  last segment it's hard getting through that whole clip without wanting to scream at the top of your
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:42.000]  lungs and i'll tell you what now i would just say if you believe that i got a bridge i want to sell
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.280]  you i mean we all know this that's coming from a lady who lied about being gazi and blamed it on a
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:52.640]  video so you know if that's the person they want to trust i mean we all know that a politician's
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:56.320]  lying because their lips are moving i mean she wants to say that she's experienced in foreign
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:01.280]  policy but she doesn't want to talk about the success or failure of those experiences yeah she's
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:05.840]  got a lot of experience she's got a lot of failed experiences in foreign policy that she doesn't
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:11.920]  want you to see she also doesn't seem to care at all about the religion of the secular state right
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:17.120]  now which is national security i mean here she is she is a national security heretic i guess you
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:23.600]  could say darryl because even though this is used to justify every invasion on our individual
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:28.160]  liberties the security state was completely ignored by hillary clinton as she set up her own
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:34.640]  parallel unsecured emails discussing things that were born classified discussions that she had with
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:39.680]  foreign leaders but i want to take some calls from people but as we're waiting for that it's
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:43.840]  eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine that's eight seven seven seven eight nine
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:51.520]  alex if you want to talk to us about what the issues are here tell us again what you think
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:55.760]  is the right way for christians to handle this well i just want to kind of go back to hillary
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:00.960]  real quick you know i would just challenge her as i did everybody in the video like if if helping
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:06.080]  these refugees without putting other people's in in harms way without bringing them in here
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:11.520]  and taking that chance um you know if that's not good enough for you then call your congressman
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:17.200]  call up hillary or in fact since she wants to be president why don't she lead by example and just uh
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:21.840]  you know vet these people however she thinks she can vet them which i still don't know how they would
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:26.000]  do that but even if she was able to vet them and then haven't come stay with her and bill
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.680]  you know i mean if you really love them that much just bring them on into your house and then
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:34.720]  let them live with you and you can be responsible for them and you can take care of them you can
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:39.120]  spend the money to feed them and house them and all those other things why impose your will on
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:45.040]  other people under the name of love and of goodness i don't ever see that happen in fact
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:50.160]  unlike the cron unlike islam which teaches you know hate your enemies hate the christian hate the
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:56.800]  jew in fact here's a here's a quote from you right straight from the core cron um i guess it's it's
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:01.920]  in eight two it says i'll cast terror into the hearts of those that disbelieve therefore strike
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:06.480]  off their heads and strike off every fingertip from them now nowhere in the bible you ever
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:11.280]  going to find jesus say kill those that don't convert i mean it is just the way it is and
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:16.640]  so those people that want to like hillary say we're being wicked we're being evil we're being mean
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:21.440]  we're being untolerant unloving and unkind well like tell them just put their money where their
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:25.920]  mouth is you know one once you put your own actions let them speak louder than your words
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:29.760]  and you know go take care of them yourself once you just go over to syria and do the job
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:33.520]  you should have done in the first place when you were secretary of state and you issued that
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:38.160]  challenge to people you said uh if you think you can do a better job uh why don't you go there
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:42.720]  we'll talk about that and we come back we'll also take uh callers questions for daryl rundus we'll
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:52.720]  be right back
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:06.320]  and it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true

[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:35.040]  you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:41.440]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and joining us now is darryl rundus he's a pastor
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:49.200]  out of the dallas area and of course he responded to criticisms of the left for the most part
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:55.600]  democrats who were saying that it was un christian to not want to bring in as many migrants out of
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:01.040]  the syrian war of course nobody ever mentions the yemen war because that's our our ally
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:06.800]  saudi arabia who is directly attacking yemen there but it's all about syria and as we pointed out
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:15.440]  they always want you to focus on their solution once they create a problem you know we were told
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:21.760]  when it came to guns this last week we had a massive media move to get people to be afraid
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:27.520]  of the ability of people who are on a government watch list to be able to buy guns even with
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:33.760]  background checks by the fbi so fox news and many other outlets put this out there told us be very
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:40.560]  afraid we've got people who are terrorists who are out there possibly buying guns well not exactly
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:45.840]  i think you need to be more afraid of a government that creates secret lists of people than you need
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:51.520]  to be afraid of people who can pass background checks from the fbi who get their weapons legally
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:57.920]  so in the same vein i think we need to be very concerned about what's going on with this phony
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:04.560]  solution not addressing the root cause i believe because this is really a tactic of sol linsky and
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:11.520]  of course hillary clinton did her senior thesis on this at wellesley she did a 92 page thesis
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:16.880]  on sol linsky's rules for radicals number four is make the enemy live up to his own rulebook so
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:23.600]  that's what's behind the criticism of christians who say this is not a wise discerning policy to
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:26.640]  bring in people we don't know who they are we don't know where they're coming from we don't
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:32.400]  know what their agenda is this is not the way to handle this i want to go now daryl to take some
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:37.760]  calls we've got several people who have called in here i asked the people who disagree with us on
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:45.840]  this to uh to call to them we'll put them at the top of the line again that number is 877-789-2539
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:56.000]  that's 877-789 alex let's go to haboo in wisconsin hubu uh yes hello happy holidays to you thank you
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.880]  thank you for the courtesy um and and it's very nice to talk to you and i'll get to my point right
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:11.440]  away info wars more than any other news outlet has applied a full court press to all the machinations
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:20.960]  that the united states has has done in syria libya iraq etc and so what you are exposing by
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:28.640]  by this news coverage that uh is how we have wrecked those countries yes now if i i have to
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:35.280]  agree with info wars that you can't have a nation with open borders uh you know going into infinity
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:41.040]  a nation is only complete when its borders are secure among many other things but that is one of
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:47.200]  the main tenets and um you know everybody and their uncle from china and i'm not particularly
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:53.920]  picking out any race or nationality but people from nation's areas not even affected by the
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:37:01.200]  united states directly are coming in here for a free ride and but yet those people who have been
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:06.960]  actually hurt by the doings of the united states government and and its armed forces in particular
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:13.200]  uh are being denied um uh uh disability to come here i'm not saying for
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.360]  and iraq's entire population to come here but those who've been completely compromised there's
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:27.440]  no infrastructure left and you know one of the things uh that that um that that constitution
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:33.440]  that the u.s force fed down the iraqi people's throats is at the heart of this problem because
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:39.200]  it has marginalized the sunni sect and that is who is into ices so just two points then and thank
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:43.760]  you very much for the courtesy oh i agree thank you very much that's a very courteous call and i
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:50.720]  would say that when we look at the iraq war we look at that invasion it was absolutely the
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:57.200]  wrong thing to do it's a horrible thing to do and what i see happening now is instead of correcting
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:02.720]  the first mistake our government will always create a second or a third or a fourth mistake
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:08.080]  they will now invade the united states with people in order to try to solve that problem
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:14.240]  i don't think that's the right solution i'll go to darrell in just a moment my concern is that
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:19.280]  you don't see saudi arabia or any of the arab states as i mentioned earlier that we know
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:26.560]  are supporting this situation in syria this war this manufactured war in syria i would like to see
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:32.960]  the people who are concerned as you are habu we need to try to make people understand the way to
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:37.760]  stop this is to address the root cause to address this war that we have started that we continue
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:42.960]  to find along with our arab allies and in the same way many of the people who are fleeing
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:47.600]  from the uh the war situation in mexico and understand that is a huge war there's been
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:52.320]  more people that have died in the drug war in mexico than have died in afghanistan
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:59.520]  they're fleeing here because of a war that we began the war on drugs and rather than erect
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:04.400]  massive walls rather than create a police state rather than give everybody a government identity
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:09.840]  card with biometric idea on it so we can see who's who i want us to stop the root cause of that which
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:15.440]  is this war on drugs that we have that is the plague of central and south america along with
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:19.520]  the socialism that people have embraced their people not everything is imposed upon them some
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:24.480]  of these horrible things are of their own making because they have embraced socialism and other
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:30.240]  things as we are perhaps on the verge of embracing uh let me get your comments on that darryl well i
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:35.120]  would just say you know to the caller and into what you were just speaking to is that no one's
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:40.080]  saying we shouldn't help these people you know i agree i mean we got involved in the middle east
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:45.040]  and did some things that just are horrific and we did them for all the wrong reasons very political
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:49.760]  um really probably the end result as the bible says the love of money is the root of all sorts
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:55.120]  of evil so we know when these big contractors in the middle east like kelog brownen root and you
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:40:00.960]  know uh halliburton and and people like that get these no bid cost plus contracts uh you know we
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:04.880]  know where their motive is we know where their heart is but no one's saying we shouldn't help
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:11.120]  these poor people um what we're saying is we can't vet them and they come from an area that headquarters
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:16.640]  an organization by the name of isis that wants to do death and destruction and kill people and i
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:21.840]  would just anybody that says we're not being wise we're not being loving we're not being kind by
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:27.920]  wanting these people to be helped but not actually put other people at harm's way i would just once
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:33.600]  again say well which of you would put your own family your own kids in harm's way in order to try
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:38.400]  to help someone else and then call that love i mean if somebody came up to you or your kids and
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:42.560]  wanted to do harm to your kids because they thought they were helping someone else would
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:46.480]  you consider that to be loving and of course you wouldn't so exactly you're talking about the love of
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:49.920]  money being the root of all evil i guess we could be a little bit more specific about that now we
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:55.280]  could say the love of the petrodollar has been the root of all of these middle eastern wars that
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:59.760]  we've seen because that's why they give them a free pass on this i'm looking at this article
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:06.240]  again from michael krueger about a 2008 references a 2008 us army funded rand report says the economies
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:10.960]  the industrialized states will continue to rely heavily on oil making it strategically important
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:15.680]  so the u.s has a motive for maintaining stability in and good relations with middle eastern states
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:19.280]  will actually they don't have a motive for maintaining stability they want to destabilize
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:25.280]  them and if we understand that as you just pointed out there are ways to help rather than bringing
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:30.480]  in people who we don't know who these people are and could quite possibly be enemy combatants there
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:37.760]  are other better ways that we could help the people even though we did create this situation
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:42.720]  i think we need to be wise now about how we try to bring this down for both their benefit
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:50.080]  and for our benefit many people have suggested as trump had let's carve out a safe area in that
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:55.520]  country in syria or an adjacent country let's carve that out let's guard that and create a
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:42:01.520]  safe haven for people where we can uh care for them until we get this war situation star
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:05.760]  stopped but of course we understand what you're trying to say is let's create a place of refuge
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:12.160]  yes or refugees exactly exactly rather than just indiscriminately bringing them in because we know
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:18.160]  that the people who have started this war over there just like the people who have uh are advocating
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:24.000]  bringing them in they want to create order out of chaos they want to bring down societies so
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.560]  they can put in place the dictators in the middle eastern countries that they want force
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:32.880]  feed the constitution as this caller was just talking about force feed that on the iraqis
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:37.040]  put in their own leaders they want to do the same thing here one of the things that they have to do
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:42.560]  of course is to destroy the country so they can rebuild it into the kind of situation that they
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:57.040]  want when we come back we're going to take some more of your calls stay with us we'll be right back with daryl rendas
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:03.680]  explosives were found during an attempted terror attack at a german soccer stadium on november 17th
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:07.760]  but german authorities covered it all up according to an eyewitness who was told to keep quiet about
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:12.880]  what he saw a paramedic saw an explosive device in ambulance before the germany versus netherlands
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:17.440]  game which was canceled after french intelligence told german authorities about the impending attack
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:22.240]  involving several bombs authorities later claimed no explosives were found but the paramedic says he
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:26.960]  witnessed the bomb and was ordered not to talk about it after special forces arrived on the scene
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:30.800]  three police officers were also reportedly disciplined for leaking information about the
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:35.280]  alleged discovery of the bombs german authorities may have decided to conceal the fact that the
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:39.200]  explosives were found in order to prevent a panic amongst the fans who had gathered around the
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:44.000]  stadium before the match and also to protect german chancellor angelo merkel who has opened the
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.320]  borders for middle eastern migrants to flood the country including isis this is kit daniel's

[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:14.880]  hello john we know in the multitude of people with the king donner but in the want of people
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:20.160]  is the destruction of the prince and i hope that the girl you have a thousand member church there
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:27.920]  i really do everything you guys say is is totally accurate you know it really is totally accurate
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:34.320]  it's precise it's true and i had a guy tell me today that i was not a christian because i
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:40.560]  said if i was the governor i'd i'd say we can't bring the terrorists in here okay but a christian
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:45.840]  who swears and owes to the constitution is obligated as much as he feels sorry for people
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:51.680]  and as much as he knows that we we hit the wrong stinking country iraq you know it's not the guilty
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:58.640]  ones it was Saudi arabia but still we have an obligation to protect our people and really
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:04.320]  obama should be we should bypass the impeachment thing and just go ahead and arrest him and say look
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:10.080]  we are not going to take terrorists because as christians we believe that jesus you know said
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:14.320]  what he said we're to love our enemies well we're not supposed to you know kill them and
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:19.520]  get rewarded for killing your enemies the muslims you know they do stay in their book
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:25.360]  that you are rewarded with the 72 blushing virgins if you kill people he says that
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:32.720]  i agree i i agree with you i think that the uh the iraq invasion especially as we look at it
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:38.240]  today with the advantage of hindsight it was idiotic it was immoral i think it is also idiotic
[01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:43.680]  to say that we are going to uh invade the united states the people that we can't uh that uh your
[01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:50.640]  comments uh uh pastor rundas i uh just concur obviously uh any christian that's really sought
[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:55.760]  the answers or seeks the truth they're going to come to the same um revelation in fact i know
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:52:00.560]  we're running out of time so i'm just going to leave everybody with a uh passage from paul and
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:06.160]  aphesians five that speaks to this very issue and it's just simply verse uh starts with verse 11
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:11.120]  says have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather expose them for
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:15.680]  shameful to even speak of the things which are done by them in secret but all things that are
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:21.680]  exposed are made manifest by the light for whatever makes manifest is light therefore he says
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:27.520]  and this is great for people that listen to info wars awake you who sleep arise from the dead and
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:34.080]  christ will give you life see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:40.480]  the time because the days are evil therefore don't be unwise but understand what the will of the Lord
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:46.720]  is and i think uh nothing could be clear it's not the will of God for you to put other people or
[01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:52.000]  your own lives in harm's way to go try to help someone else and then call that love that's hip
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:57.600]  that's hypocrisy that's not love at all yes let's go to uh matthew and sandiego matthew go ahead
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:04.800]  David night good to talk to you sir um i try to be quick i have a lot to yeah thank you i have a
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:10.400]  lot to say on this uh the subject but to make it quick really we've got governors all across the
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:14.960]  country right now that are some of them are standing up and saying no unless we can properly
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:19.440]  vet these people they can't come to our state and that's what it really comes down to i was just
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:23.760]  having an argument last night somebody's like oh well the president should just go ahead and
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:29.040]  just that and the other no the president does not run the country the people run the country we tell
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:33.600]  the state the state cap is what we want then they go to congress and then they make it happen
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:38.720]  so that's what it comes down to is the state taking control and then let's say you know if
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:42.160]  you're christian and you're living in a state where you feel all great my governor is now
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:47.360]  going to put me in my family in danger let's have a mass exodus moving to state where they are going
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:51.760]  to protect you i'm uh i've been my last year to get my journeyman's blumber certification
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:56.160]  i've got family in texas i'm moving out of california and i'm going to texas because at
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:54:01.840]  least some people there in my opinion still have some common sense you know yes i think yeah i think
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:07.520]  the uh the governor is uh has been right on an amazing number of issues i'm very happy so far
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:12.400]  with most of the things i've seen governor abedou and of course when i see people criticize that
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:17.280]  matthew and say that you have to do what obama says we have to understand these are executive
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:21.920]  orders they're not laws and he doesn't have that power under the constitution so it is a rightful
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:29.600]  position of uh of the state governors to interpose themselves when uh we've got a an executive
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:34.880]  who thinks that he has the right to dictate things to us by executive orders the rightful thing for
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:40.400]  them to interpose themselves to nullify that uh that's what the kentucky resolutions were about
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:46.320]  uh 217 years ago we've still been having that discussion but clearly if we allow all power
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:53.440]  to be concentrated in one body of men or in one man in washington we are inviting a tyranny
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:57.360]  everybody should be concerned about that and even people on the left need to understand
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:04.160]  that the only reason that these states could uh legalize marijuana in washington or again other
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:10.080]  places is colorado is because they have the right to do that under the constitution and the federal
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:14.800]  government has been reluctant to do anything about that that's why i think they have uh modified
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:19.440]  their position on just that one drug because they realize the entire war on drugs the entire
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:24.160]  prohibition uh is unconstitutional they never passed an amendment like they did with alcohol
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:29.440]  and whether or not you agree uh that the government ought to uh beat the heads in of people who are
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:34.480]  on a self-destructive binge uh i don't i don't think that we should um i don't i don't think
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:38.880]  that our god is so small that we need to have government beat people into uh doing the right
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:44.240]  thing but whether you agree with that or not at least follow the law at least pass a uh
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:48.720]  an amendment to the constitution like they uh did with alcohol your comments darryl no i would
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:54.560]  just completely agree especially with the war on drugs um but we don't go arrest in fact i never
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:00.960]  saw jesus arrest anybody or call for their arrest because they were a drunker right so um these people
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:05.680]  may need help they may have addiction issues and so on but to lock them up ruin their lives ruin their
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:10.640]  families lives it's the decay of society and it's not just the drug use as much as it is
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:15.200]  the repercussions of being thrown in jail and having that on their record for the rest of their
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:19.120]  lives exactly they get a long mandatory minimum and then they can't get a job once they get out
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:23.760]  it it corrupts government it destroys the rule of law in so many different ways but i think it's
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:27.520]  important to interject one last one last thought because i know we're running out of time if anybody
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:33.280]  wants to go see the original video i would just encourage them to go to facebook forward slash
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:38.080]  prayer stop we've got it pinned at the top you can watch the video make comments we actually are one
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:43.680]  of those rare pages that actually reads all the comments and uh in response to them as best we
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:48.560]  can so okay good we've been showing that on the monitor for people watching the video and also
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:53.040]  is there link to that at your website prayer stop dot org actually i don't think there's a link on our
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:57.760]  website that's why i wanted to go ahead just kind of plug the so let me to see that at facebook

[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:12.960]  yeah i agree with what all the pollers have said so far and uh i would i would go a little bit
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:19.200]  further though diversity uh by those who are pushing it as an agenda is code
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:26.880]  for white genocide and and for a guy like me who wants to preserve my culture my dna my race
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:32.880]  that's not evil and we need to take a good long look at anyone who is pushing uh propaganda that
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:38.880]  that is evil uh it's it's misguided uh it's basically at the very least a result of misguided
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:44.080]  long-term social right right at the time frank yeah i agree we need to look very carefully from
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:47.760]  when people are selling us intolerance and calling it tolerance thank you so much for
