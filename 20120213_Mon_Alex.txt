[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:36.920]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.920 --> 00:46.600]  all right my friends it is Monday the 13th day of February 2012 and we're
[00:46.600 --> 00:53.200]  going to be live here for the next three hours now Ed Asner has been involved
[00:53.200 --> 01:01.000]  producing a new film that basically puts 9-11 on trial the official story and he
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.880]  is going to be joining us in the third hour today and we'll also take some calls
[01:05.880 --> 01:10.480]  for Ed I don't agree with Ed's politics when it comes to socialism and things
[01:10.480 --> 01:14.080]  because I know that it never works and of the ultra rich actually promote
[01:14.080 --> 01:21.840]  socialism as a way to consolidate power but he is a well-meaning individual who
[01:21.840 --> 01:25.920]  I think is very honorable you know even if I don't agree with a right winger or a
[01:25.920 --> 01:30.600]  left winger or a libertarian on a specific issue a lot of it is where
[01:30.600 --> 01:36.120]  their heart is coming from and the fact that they have you know the courage of
[01:36.120 --> 01:41.680]  their conviction real corruption real evil is consciously knowing how the
[01:41.680 --> 01:49.480]  world works and basically playing it off against the general population and so
[01:49.480 --> 01:55.280]  we'll be talking to Ed Asner coming up about this 9-11 film that is being
[01:55.280 --> 02:03.920]  produced and 9-11 10 plus years later in the meantime today we are going to have
[02:03.920 --> 02:10.000]  open phones after I cover some of the news and obviously the news is just off
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.480]  the charts wild I meant yesterday to get some into Whitney Houston because it
[02:15.480 --> 02:22.120]  ties into other statistics on drug overdose a prescription drug overdose
[02:22.120 --> 02:30.220]  and how many how many times more dangerous it is compared to illegal
[02:30.220 --> 02:35.200]  drugs which I don't support or promote either it's just that the illegal drugs
[02:35.200 --> 02:39.440]  are kept illegal because they're clandestine because they're non pharmacological
[02:39.440 --> 02:44.640]  and are grown and the and the big pharma cannot create a monopoly on them and so
[02:44.640 --> 02:48.960]  big pharma through banking subsidiaries would rather simply also control the
[02:48.960 --> 02:54.040]  illegal naturally occurring drugs so they can keep the price up so we'll be
[02:54.040 --> 02:59.480]  covering some of that also the Denver Post has got an article out demonizing
[02:59.480 --> 03:04.360]  Sheriff Richard max movement meeting with over a hundred sheriffs a few weeks
[03:04.360 --> 03:07.680]  ago that we've covered and talked about educating them about the 10th Amendment
[03:07.680 --> 03:12.360]  States rights movement that ties in with the New York Times freaking out over
[03:12.360 --> 03:19.600]  people waking up to agenda 21 all over the United States and worldwide humanity
[03:19.600 --> 03:24.400]  is really waking up and that's very very exciting Obama has rolled out his new
[03:24.400 --> 03:28.320]  budget and we have big developments on the Syria and Iran front I'm gonna cover
[03:28.320 --> 03:36.720]  that first when we come back and Ron Paul has come out and is challenging main
[03:36.720 --> 03:42.480]  and and saying they're serious anomaly so good job to Ron Paul on that front and
[03:42.480 --> 03:46.800]  the New York Times has the headline could Ron Paul still win main here's the
[03:46.800 --> 03:51.000]  info wars.com article and prison planet.com article by Steve Watson Paul
[03:51.000 --> 03:57.840]  campaign points to anomalies in Romney Wayne main victory slams mainstream media
[03:57.840 --> 04:03.520]  suggest Romney may have had a hand in canceling key County caucuses because of
[04:03.520 --> 04:10.120]  snow and things and a CPAC boss as Jeb Bush may be nominee at Brokered
[04:10.120 --> 04:16.520]  Convention so that's just some of the news we're going to be breaking down
[04:16.520 --> 04:22.440]  also the Daily Caller by the way even though he's called me names and he
[04:22.440 --> 04:28.240]  thought that Adam Cokesh worked for me up there when they were in the what New
[04:28.240 --> 04:33.200]  Hampshire primaries I want to go ahead and get Tucker Carlson on so I think the

[04:37.520 --> 04:41.120]  for Rand Paul as a communications director so I want to get Tucker on for a
[04:41.120 --> 04:46.280]  friendly not debate about 9-11 truth but about other issues so let's try to get

[08:31.960 --> 08:36.760]  next three hours thank you so much for joining us well the coroner is now
[08:36.760 --> 08:41.560]  confirming she died from prescription drugs Whitney Houston
[08:41.560 --> 08:49.480]  she did not die from um going underwater in the bathtub she did not drown
[08:49.480 --> 08:53.560]  and she did not die from illegal drugs she died from
[08:53.560 --> 08:57.640]  legal prescription drugs just like Marilyn Monroe
[08:57.640 --> 09:01.480]  just like Elvis and just like countless other
[09:01.480 --> 09:08.840]  millions of people conservatively over 150,000 people die a year just from
[09:08.840 --> 09:14.920]  prescription drugs that are based in opiates and then of course you've got
[09:14.920 --> 09:18.120]  well over a hundred thousand other deaths on top of that some years it's
[09:18.120 --> 09:21.560]  300 plus thousand total
[09:22.040 --> 09:25.800]  where people die from different types of drug interaction
[09:25.800 --> 09:29.720]  Paul Watson has an article up at info wars dot com
[09:29.720 --> 09:32.520]  with the headline that the establishment media
[09:32.520 --> 09:36.280]  is hiding the fact that Whitney Houston died
[09:36.280 --> 09:40.360]  from prescription drugs just like it's always
[09:40.360 --> 09:47.480]  buried in the news that every single school shooter
[09:47.480 --> 09:51.560]  we've seen it always comes out later in the trials or the investigation
[09:51.560 --> 09:55.480]  but but but but never in the first week that
[09:55.480 --> 09:59.720]  all of them that i've ever seen have been on riddlin prozac or
[09:59.720 --> 10:05.800]  mixtures of them and i shot a video uh yesterday morning when it came out that
[10:05.800 --> 10:08.600]  the police reported there was a whole bunch of prescription drugs including
[10:08.600 --> 10:12.920]  Xanax that she was mixing i shot a video that's
[10:12.920 --> 10:17.560]  gone viral the secret the secret of Whitney
[10:17.560 --> 10:21.640]  Houston's death discovered and the reason i'm beginning the broadcast with
[10:21.640 --> 10:25.080]  this today is because we can save lives
[10:25.080 --> 10:28.680]  we can grab victory from the jaws of defeat
[10:28.680 --> 10:32.520]  with her tragic death she was an unrivaled talent
[10:32.520 --> 10:36.520]  i personally have never really been into that genre
[10:36.520 --> 10:41.080]  of music but i actually did like her songs
[10:41.080 --> 10:44.760]  the ones that she did in the 80s and early 90s before she became
[10:44.760 --> 10:48.120]  addicted to a cocktail of different illegal
[10:48.120 --> 10:51.480]  and legal drugs and alcohol and destroyed herself
[10:51.480 --> 10:56.280]  with her boyfriend but we need to point out that
[10:56.280 --> 10:59.240]  there's never been one death from marijuana you can pull that up the
[10:59.240 --> 11:02.840]  government admits that i don't smoke marijuana i've smoked it
[11:02.840 --> 11:06.280]  before i've i've experimented i don't particularly like it
[11:06.280 --> 11:10.200]  but so i'm not saying decriminalized marijuana because i'm a pothead
[11:10.200 --> 11:13.080]  i actually know a lot of folks that have had their motivation destroyed by
[11:13.080 --> 11:17.480]  marijuana some people that are already
[11:17.480 --> 11:21.640]  aggressive and type a personalities have been empowered by marijuana they said
[11:21.640 --> 11:25.720]  helps them not become angry it helps takes the edge off they
[11:25.720 --> 11:28.600]  kind of self medicate like some people do with a glass of wine
[11:28.600 --> 11:33.080]  i think that's fine but for a lot of people it does
[11:33.080 --> 11:36.360]  turn people into zombies i've seen marijuana take people
[11:36.360 --> 11:41.720]  that were just moderate students not too aggressive not too ambitious but
[11:41.720 --> 11:45.560]  but had futures and i've seen it destroy
[11:45.560 --> 11:51.800]  them turn them into zombies and the whole marijuana worship crowd is
[11:51.800 --> 11:54.840]  going to get mad at me there look i'm for decriminalization
[11:54.840 --> 12:00.440]  it has thousands of known medical uses it's a magic herb given to us by god
[12:00.440 --> 12:05.160]  i'm for total decriminalization but i'm not going to sit there and say
[12:05.160 --> 12:09.480]  it isn't a double-edged sword now that said cops pull me over and ask if
[12:09.480 --> 12:13.560]  there's drugs in my car i use no illegal drugs
[12:13.560 --> 12:18.120]  and i normally legal drugs i use now are caffeine and
[12:18.120 --> 12:22.600]  i guess i take rebound and it's got some ginseng in it
[12:22.600 --> 12:25.800]  and and occasionally i do have a glass of red wine still
[12:25.800 --> 12:29.320]  if i'm eating a big juicy steak or out having Italian food
[12:29.320 --> 12:34.120]  i'm on a diet so i'm not out eating that very often the point is is that they
[12:34.120 --> 12:38.040]  they put out chemicals into the society legal and illegal
[12:38.040 --> 12:41.880]  that they know the human body once and
[12:41.880 --> 12:46.040]  different types of people are predisposed chemically towards liking
[12:46.040 --> 12:49.720]  different types of drugs and when you use it
[12:49.720 --> 12:52.920]  they arrest you and take you to a prison
[12:52.920 --> 12:56.440]  and has it cut back on drug use no we have the highest per capita
[12:56.440 --> 13:00.280]  look it up we're the most obese the most unhealthy the most dumb down
[13:00.280 --> 13:04.840]  and we use more drugs than any other country
[13:04.840 --> 13:09.000]  not just per capita but period i've seen the graphs
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.360]  some graphs have the united states using over one
[13:12.360 --> 13:16.280]  third of illegal drugs in fact just type in
[13:16.280 --> 13:19.240]  us uses most illegal drugs in the world
[13:19.240 --> 13:22.920]  us drinks more alcohol yeah there it is us leads the world
[13:22.920 --> 13:27.800]  in illegal drug use gbs news we also lead the world in alcohol
[13:27.800 --> 13:32.680]  we lead the world in cancer diabetes neurological disorders
[13:32.680 --> 13:38.200]  in divorce we are a cursed blighted nation
[13:38.200 --> 13:41.640]  we've come from being the greatest nation with the
[13:41.640 --> 13:45.960]  with the highest iq the highest test scores the most inventions
[13:45.960 --> 13:53.640]  the most wealth the most free the most aggressive to the most pathetic
[13:53.640 --> 13:57.400]  i can and i'm not saying all this because oh look america's bad
[13:57.400 --> 14:03.720]  ha i'm like look at this let's clean ourselves up
[14:03.720 --> 14:11.800]  again there was prohibition in the 1920s for nine years and alcohol use
[14:11.800 --> 14:19.960]  more than tripled alcohol poisoning some statistics are five times higher
[14:19.960 --> 14:26.440]  than it was crime exploded in some areas more than 20 times
[14:26.440 --> 14:29.800]  go look it up you can just type in whatever i say you'll get
[14:29.800 --> 14:33.240]  government documents congressional studies news
[14:33.240 --> 14:37.320]  crime exploded during prohibition fact guys you just showed them cbs
[14:37.320 --> 14:40.040]  type in crime exploded during prohibition everybody knows that but
[14:40.040 --> 14:45.240]  you know what let's document everything we say to a neurotic new level
[14:45.240 --> 14:50.440]  here so crime explodes the police before who were just
[14:50.440 --> 14:53.480]  corrupt running the gambling and the prostitution
[14:53.480 --> 14:57.800]  now they could get huge profits off of alcohol now the christians figured out
[14:57.800 --> 15:00.920]  they'd been con and manipulated into pushing for prohibition when the
[15:00.920 --> 15:04.440]  crime rate exploded and it became so cool to be drunk constantly
[15:04.440 --> 15:07.720]  and speak easy there were more bars than ever
[15:07.720 --> 15:12.840]  and the big alcohol producers just use it to shut down all their competition
[15:12.840 --> 15:16.040]  and we went from thousands of breweries to just you know less than 10 after
[15:16.040 --> 15:19.800]  prohibition with all the regulations that came in
[15:19.800 --> 15:26.280]  within one year of prohibition ending they decriminalized speed variants
[15:26.280 --> 15:34.520]  opiate variants synthetic opiates uh raw opiates heroin marijuana
[15:34.520 --> 15:38.120]  and dozens of other drugs and what the cops do
[15:38.120 --> 15:43.000]  they're like we got to have a business and the mobsters that control the police
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.600]  that's the kennedys that's the jewish mob the italian mob
[15:46.600 --> 15:51.960]  the wasp mob the bushes were all involved uh i had family that was dixie
[15:51.960 --> 15:55.480]  mafia involved running all the major liquor operations
[15:55.480 --> 15:59.640]  large portions of it in houston uh some of the most wealthy families in
[15:59.640 --> 16:04.680]  austin uh ran the liquor for al capone as well
[16:04.680 --> 16:09.160]  people like the steiners uh i mean i mean this is what goes on
[16:09.160 --> 16:14.600]  this is how this is how america ran during prohibition
[16:14.600 --> 16:22.440]  and when prohibition ended they said we got to have something new
[16:22.440 --> 16:25.880]  cocaine heroin you name it and then they had movies actually
[16:25.880 --> 16:30.040]  come out and show the drugs being used and show it being cool in the movies
[16:30.040 --> 16:34.760]  and and the hippest thing and then by it being illegal low-level dealers could
[16:34.760 --> 16:39.400]  have nice houses nice cars prostitutes it was seen as cool
[16:39.400 --> 16:45.880]  and so everybody adopted it so yeah there it is uh the not so roaring 20s
[16:45.880 --> 16:53.320]  new york times and it goes into the exploding crime rate uh right there
[16:53.320 --> 16:57.000]  at first glance if you blow that up i can read it to new york times who knows
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.960]  if it's true the numbers do seem to support the
[16:59.960 --> 17:03.880]  conventional wisdom according to census mortality statistics the national
[17:03.880 --> 17:07.480]  homicide rate jumped 40 under prohibition
[17:07.480 --> 17:11.080]  after it was repealed and 33 murder rates plummeted
[17:11.080 --> 17:14.600]  it's only natural concede that criminalizing the market for alcohol
[17:14.600 --> 17:18.760]  caused a huge increase in crime and then they go on and whitewash it and go
[17:18.760 --> 17:25.000]  let's just keep drugs illegal uh never mind those numbers

[17:32.360 --> 17:40.360]  of what happened with prohibition i've only given you a small
[17:40.360 --> 17:46.840]  portion of the news and the information concerning that i could go into
[17:46.840 --> 17:50.520]  on record british intelligence couldn't take over china
[17:50.520 --> 17:55.320]  but china made one mistake china what 300 years ago or so you can look up the
[17:55.320 --> 17:59.800]  dates right around 300 years ago made opium illegal
[17:59.800 --> 18:05.800]  punishable by death uh oh you did it giant black market there'd always been
[18:05.800 --> 18:10.440]  opium addicts in china with it coming in out of afghanistan
[18:10.440 --> 18:17.960]  and indochina and within just a space of 70 plus years
[18:17.960 --> 18:21.000]  they first took over the port towns and the police
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.760]  the british intel did and within 70 plus years the entire country
[18:24.760 --> 18:28.360]  they broke it in what first six parts then nine parts
[18:28.360 --> 18:33.400]  finally more than 12 parts and they had the french zone the us zone the dutch
[18:33.400 --> 18:36.760]  zone the german zone the british control the ports
[18:36.760 --> 18:40.520]  and they ran the whole country and put warlords in charge
[18:40.520 --> 18:44.040]  and brought all the drugs in and addicted the country
[18:44.040 --> 18:51.400]  and they went wow this works really good and that was the impetus for in the 30s
[18:51.400 --> 18:56.440]  saying let's do to europe and to the united states what we did to china
[18:56.440 --> 19:00.840]  we'll make it illegal we'll corrupt the police we'll take over the entire
[19:00.840 --> 19:04.920]  society and and what's it done last time i saw numbers
[19:04.920 --> 19:10.280]  since the mid 1970s by 2005 the last time i saw numbers from the justice
[19:10.280 --> 19:14.680]  department the dea there's triple the cocaine
[19:14.680 --> 19:19.400]  use and triple the heroin use and actually i've seen numbers it's into
[19:19.400 --> 19:22.280]  heroin's increase since the cia got that really
[19:22.280 --> 19:26.520]  bumper crop now 92 of world heroin supply out of opium
[19:26.520 --> 19:29.800]  out of afghanistan and they got the troops growing that smack and bringing it
[19:29.800 --> 19:32.760]  in as fast as they can and having them on the news growing it of course
[19:32.760 --> 19:35.640]  because the slaves are busy watching football and since the troops don't
[19:35.640 --> 19:38.360]  like growing the opium we'll just put them on the news doing it and then the
[19:38.360 --> 19:40.920]  troops are going to a scythe and think well it must be okay

[22:11.000 --> 22:14.120]  grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized
[22:14.120 --> 22:18.360]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key

[24:22.920 --> 24:30.920]  yeah
[24:31.080 --> 24:36.680]  we are run by a criminal mafia but it's a mafia that hired a bunch of
[24:36.680 --> 24:41.720]  scientists to create a scientific control grid
[24:41.720 --> 24:44.920]  look at this news this is out of the daily mail today
[24:44.920 --> 24:48.280]  notice that uh ten years ago you never heard people talking about eugenics
[24:48.280 --> 24:51.800]  now you see it in the news almost every day we're forcing it out there
[24:51.800 --> 24:55.880]  and as people begin to get knowledge of it they discover the entire system is
[24:55.880 --> 24:58.360]  based on it
[24:58.360 --> 25:02.920]  Yale University's plan to create an intellectually superior race of children
[25:02.920 --> 25:07.560]  to depopulate and repopulate britain after world war two
[25:07.560 --> 25:12.440]  Yale University only offered children of oxford and cambridge university
[25:12.440 --> 25:15.640]  staff on evacuation of the u.s during nuclear war with
[25:15.640 --> 25:18.760]  russia one evacuee had raised questions about the
[25:18.760 --> 25:23.400]  experience asking did they want to save the gene pool
[25:23.400 --> 25:29.720]  Yale's president james angel was a quote fanatic eugenicist in the
[25:29.720 --> 25:33.320]  worst meaning of the word
[25:33.320 --> 25:37.560]  and again every major university that we've looked into randomly
[25:37.560 --> 25:41.720]  the biology department heads the psychology department heads
[25:41.720 --> 25:44.680]  they are always i've randomly checked universities
[25:44.680 --> 25:50.280]  Yale harvard ut they're always writing papers about
[25:50.280 --> 25:55.400]  reducing population and eugenics and again my dad top of his
[25:55.400 --> 25:59.800]  class already at ut in high school part of a summer program
[25:59.800 --> 26:03.080]  they test 160 the smartest kids in texas take the
[26:03.080 --> 26:06.040]  top six bring them into a room and tell them
[26:06.040 --> 26:08.840]  you know basically we're you know you're going to be part of the future elite
[26:08.840 --> 26:12.360]  we're establishing a eugenics world government hitler was bad because he
[26:12.360 --> 26:15.720]  only wanted to go out for certain groups we're going after everybody
[26:15.720 --> 26:19.240]  and my dad was like no thank you
[26:19.400 --> 26:22.680]  he was called in by the head of the botany department and he was nothing
[26:22.680 --> 26:27.080]  special this is standard and most people get called in or told
[26:27.080 --> 26:30.040]  you're the elite you're the best you're going to be part of this they're like
[26:30.040 --> 26:34.920]  oh yes and boom that happened to bill gates it happened to all these people
[26:34.920 --> 26:38.280]  that's why warren buffett bill gates george soros
[26:38.280 --> 26:44.600]  meet at rockefeller university according to abc news to discuss global
[26:44.600 --> 26:48.840]  government and how they reduce population
[26:48.840 --> 26:53.000]  and then i covered it on the sunday show
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.480]  me and erin we're talking about it how the british royalty won't take vaccines
[26:57.480 --> 27:00.840]  eat only organic and have organic food flown around the world with them
[27:00.840 --> 27:05.400]  how the german government only eats organic and won't take vaccines
[27:05.400 --> 27:08.920]  all in the news but just hidden here and there how the chinese government has
[27:08.920 --> 27:13.000]  secret gardens and and and tries to keep it secret
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.280]  that they eat only filtered non fluoride water and
[27:16.280 --> 27:19.720]  don't take vaccines and eat only organic because they know it's designed to
[27:19.720 --> 27:23.960]  sterilize them i mean this is all in the news
[27:23.960 --> 27:27.640]  we're just aware of it and pull together like 10 mainstream articles
[27:27.640 --> 27:31.720]  and show you where it's admitted so you got bill gates openly saying he loves
[27:31.720 --> 27:35.320]  you please take a shot because he cares about you but then in a speech to a
[27:35.320 --> 27:39.080]  bunch of technocrats laughing and saying we gotta give the population
[27:39.080 --> 27:43.000]  shots so we get the human population down and
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.080]  everyone starts laughing and clapping and it cuts to all the chicken neck
[27:47.080 --> 27:50.040]  trendies who are all top of their class too
[27:50.040 --> 27:54.520]  clapping getting off on the power dr peonka texas academy of sciences
[27:54.520 --> 27:58.280]  projects red skulls on the wall this was in major texas papers
[27:58.280 --> 28:02.520]  five years ago it's in my film in game remember this
[28:02.520 --> 28:06.120]  and says we've he said his family's gonna have to die
[28:06.120 --> 28:09.320]  but world governments what's needed and we and we've got to have at least 90
[28:09.320 --> 28:14.760]  percent die and a standing ovation with people crying
[28:14.760 --> 28:17.960]  all the top scientists in texas they're at the meeting
[28:17.960 --> 28:25.000]  crying papers reporting in rapture as he says prepare to kill 90 percent
[28:25.000 --> 28:31.720]  oh yes oh crying i'm such a control freak i've got such power
[28:31.720 --> 28:36.280]  i hate everybody no they told me when i was in high school i was the smartest
[28:36.280 --> 28:41.800]  we're part of this little sick mutual you know worship society
[28:41.800 --> 28:45.240]  and peonka's like i know my family will have to die too
[28:45.240 --> 28:49.400]  i'm sad but it has to be it's going to happen soon
[28:49.400 --> 28:56.200]  we're all gonna die it's beautiful i mean this is the type of wild craziness
[28:56.200 --> 29:01.640]  that you and i and all of us are facing and you can go look up everything i'm
[29:01.640 --> 29:06.520]  saying these people are beyond nuts
[29:06.520 --> 29:11.320]  and it goes on to say that yale of course working for the u.s government was
[29:11.320 --> 29:14.840]  obsessed with the genetic bloodlines of the
[29:14.840 --> 29:18.680]  british upper class so was hitler he believed the british were even more
[29:18.680 --> 29:22.120]  arian than the germans because the germans have been overrun by other
[29:22.120 --> 29:25.000]  groups and so that's why hitler at first wouldn't
[29:25.000 --> 29:29.160]  bomb cities he'd only bomb bases so the brits in a psychological warfare op
[29:29.160 --> 29:32.840]  that's been declassified did a midnight raid early on
[29:32.840 --> 29:36.280]  into burlin bombing city so hitler would throw a fit their
[29:36.280 --> 29:40.120]  psychological warfare chiefs properly predicted to then start bombing the
[29:40.120 --> 29:43.480]  population instead of military bases because if you kept bombing the bases
[29:43.480 --> 29:46.760]  he would have won side issue though i'm gonna tell you about
[29:46.760 --> 29:53.560]  mobile sterilization vans coming up we're on the march the empires on the run

[32:07.000 --> 32:11.320]  and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we
[32:11.320 --> 32:14.520]  grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized
[32:14.520 --> 32:18.760]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[32:18.760 --> 32:23.080]  minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves
[32:23.080 --> 32:27.000]  fight off cancer and be healthy i then searched out the best

[34:42.040 --> 34:45.880]  meningitis shot which has been linked to deaths and doesn't even protect you
[34:45.880 --> 34:49.240]  there was only 20 something cases in the state of texas last year
[34:49.240 --> 34:53.720]  but rick perry says it's the law you've got to take it to get into university
[34:53.720 --> 34:56.680]  and then he blocks people entering the university
[34:56.680 --> 34:59.400]  kind of like he lied and said it was the law to take the garter cell shot and
[34:59.400 --> 35:04.120]  that couldn't hold up in court what a slimy criminal
[35:04.120 --> 35:07.000]  and all their blood's on your hands perry you little nobody i know you're

[35:22.600 --> 35:27.000]  fiction books but it paralleled reality even had some patriot leaders in it like
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.960]  mark cornkey when he wrote an earlier book
[35:29.960 --> 35:33.160]  but now it's a new york times bestseller we're going to get him on later in the
[35:33.160 --> 35:37.240]  week and we have it at info wars dot com it's good to give friends and family

[37:42.920 --> 37:47.800]  okay so the daily mail uh is reporting uh that uh
[37:47.800 --> 37:52.760]  british children during world war two well uh and and then afterwards when
[37:52.760 --> 37:57.400]  there was a threat of nuclear war were offered to come to the united states
[37:57.400 --> 38:01.880]  but only if they were of a superior genetic bloodline
[38:01.880 --> 38:05.640]  and it goes on to say the eugenics movement at Yale university may have
[38:05.640 --> 38:08.920]  extended the invitation because they plan to repopulate a devastated
[38:08.920 --> 38:13.080]  britain with a race of intellectually superior children
[38:13.080 --> 38:16.760]  and of course that's what they were doing it goes on to say was Yale hoping to
[38:16.760 --> 38:20.200]  save the offering of the british academic elite protecting those 125
[38:20.200 --> 38:24.600]  children because it saw them as future leadership class especially
[38:24.600 --> 38:28.360]  um deserving of preservation as jonathan freeland
[38:28.360 --> 38:32.520]  in the sunday telegraph as the threat of the invasion loomed
[38:32.520 --> 38:36.120]  and the terror of the nazi bombs continued Yale university sent a letter to
[38:36.120 --> 38:40.840]  both oxford and cambridge university's offering children of their fellows and
[38:40.840 --> 38:45.720]  others evacuation refuge in the us calling itself the Yale
[38:45.720 --> 38:49.080]  community receiving oxford and cambridge university children
[38:49.080 --> 38:53.640]  125 oxford children and 35 mothers took up the offer
[38:53.640 --> 38:57.960]  boarding the ss antonia from liverpool to new haven connecticut
[38:57.960 --> 39:02.280]  in 1940 and it goes on to break down the head of the
[39:02.280 --> 39:08.280]  university um was a top eugenicist and that was
[39:08.280 --> 39:13.400]  basically why they were doing it but well absolutely look when my dad was
[39:13.400 --> 39:16.120]  called in because he was uh you know one of the
[39:16.120 --> 39:19.320]  highest test scores in texas to the university of texas as a
[39:19.320 --> 39:22.840]  a junior at the time in high school and after they'd done the testing and
[39:22.840 --> 39:26.200]  called him aside they said look we need you to be part of the future elite
[39:26.200 --> 39:29.720]  kentler was bad because he only wanted to kill certain groups
[39:29.720 --> 39:33.800]  we need to carry out a global government for eugenics
[39:33.800 --> 39:39.000]  uh basically to save humanity
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.640]  and my dad said to the head of the bonding department
[39:43.640 --> 39:48.120]  well you're jewish well i mean eugenics you're like hi Hitler bad but eugenics
[39:48.120 --> 39:53.160]  good so you have to understand this is across the board this is what the elite
[39:53.160 --> 39:55.640]  see whether they're chinese whether they're jewish
[39:55.640 --> 39:58.840]  whether they're russian whether they're mexican i mean the eugenics movement
[39:58.840 --> 40:06.200]  was huge in mexico up until the 1940s and this is what's happening
[40:06.200 --> 40:09.800]  and this is what your whole world is based on
[40:09.800 --> 40:14.600]  and the disgust for humanity and instead of trying to lift up humanity
[40:14.600 --> 40:17.000]  these people have just written everyone off and
[40:17.000 --> 40:22.680]  try to create a self-fulfilling prophecy where they just try to dumb down
[40:22.680 --> 40:26.600]  the population so they can be more orderly controlled and herded and
[40:26.600 --> 40:31.720]  conditioned towards more expansive exterminations in the future
[40:31.720 --> 40:34.840]  and that's how they could get us scientists to inject poor white people
[40:34.840 --> 40:40.120]  black people with radiation radioactive particles
[40:40.120 --> 40:43.880]  radiate foster children to death who were deformed or even had mild
[40:43.880 --> 40:47.800]  retardation inject black men with syphilis over 45 years and keep it
[40:47.800 --> 40:52.120]  secret and watch them spread it in the black population
[40:52.120 --> 40:55.480]  release bio weapons in 1968 in the new york subway
[40:55.480 --> 40:59.320]  all of this has been declassified and people are oh the government wouldn't
[40:59.320 --> 41:02.120]  kill us on 9 11 or fund groups and let them attack
[41:02.120 --> 41:06.200]  no they just took 4 000 plus us foster children
[41:06.200 --> 41:10.520]  in the 1940s alone and put them in chambers
[41:10.520 --> 41:13.800]  and radiated them to death
[41:14.680 --> 41:17.720]  and i called paul watson about this this morning i said have you seen this daily
[41:17.720 --> 41:21.800]  mail and sunday times article uh that originally broke it about the eugenicist
[41:21.800 --> 41:25.240]  and wanting to save the supreme genetics of the british elite
[41:25.240 --> 41:29.400]  uh of of the academia because that's what wedgewood
[41:29.400 --> 41:33.080]  huxley darwin gallton all of them intermarried
[41:33.080 --> 41:37.640]  to try to create the superman that's what huxley was
[41:37.640 --> 41:42.360]  he wrote a book about it in 1932 1933 brave new world and later on the 60s
[41:42.360 --> 41:45.160]  said this is the real world we're trying to set up
[41:45.160 --> 41:48.680]  this is what this is not fiction this is what we want to build you can go listen
[41:48.680 --> 41:52.200]  to his berkeley speech when he knew when he knew he was dying
[41:52.200 --> 41:55.320]  he went ahead and spilled the beans but he said even though i'm telling you
[41:55.320 --> 41:58.920]  this you probably won't be able to stop us and began laughing at them
[41:58.920 --> 42:02.200]  it was not huxley having a heart and warning people
[42:02.200 --> 42:07.640]  at that very time his brother ran unesco and agenda 21 un system at the
[42:07.640 --> 42:14.680]  united nations julian huxley all this huxley's brother
[42:15.800 --> 42:19.800]  so my point here is that
[42:21.480 --> 42:24.600]  this is the global government this is what they're establishing
[42:24.600 --> 42:28.520]  this is the system they're setting up okay
[42:28.520 --> 42:33.400]  now now now here's a new one at info wars dot com
[42:34.200 --> 42:39.720]  by a great writer uh who does just amazing digging on the site
[42:39.720 --> 42:46.040]  1984 world bank report contemplates sterilization vans and camps
[42:46.040 --> 42:50.760]  fittingly it's the year 1984 and it says sterilization vans and camps to
[42:50.760 --> 42:53.560]  facilitate the sterilization policies for the third world
[42:53.560 --> 42:57.240]  and this was carried out in peru and other areas the report also threatens
[42:57.240 --> 43:00.840]  nations who are slow implementing the bank's population
[43:00.840 --> 43:04.520]  policies with drastic steps less compatible with
[43:04.520 --> 43:08.040]  individual choice and freedom and there's another report out of tens of
[43:08.040 --> 43:11.160]  thousands per year in latin america dying
[43:11.160 --> 43:14.840]  and they say it's a mystery illness why their kidneys are failing
[43:14.840 --> 43:18.520]  uh no there's been documentaries put out about the families that live
[43:18.520 --> 43:22.200]  and work next to the soybean fields and others that have the roundup sprayed
[43:22.200 --> 43:25.080]  and the roundup's going into their drinking water and killing them deader
[43:25.080 --> 43:28.200]  than a hammer it's not a mystery
[43:28.200 --> 43:31.880]  i mean i the new york times two months ago came out and said well yeah world
[43:31.880 --> 43:35.800]  bank groups are exterminating blacks to get them off the property to create a
[43:35.800 --> 43:39.640]  carbon sink uh for for for you know for this
[43:39.640 --> 43:43.960]  african country uh you know to to comply and they're
[43:43.960 --> 43:48.280]  like well it's for the earth i mean you know burning down villages and
[43:48.280 --> 43:52.840]  shooting little kids i mean maybe it's needed
[43:52.840 --> 43:56.360]  and i've saw articles out of honduras where they're
[43:56.360 --> 44:00.520]  going in and killing the people and hurting them up into compact cities
[44:00.520 --> 44:04.200]  that's what smart growth is you're going off your land you're going into a
[44:04.200 --> 44:07.720]  mega city where you can be billy clubbed and microwave gun and
[44:07.720 --> 44:12.360]  sound cannon and so horses can ride over the top of you and so you can be face
[44:12.360 --> 44:16.280]  scanned and license plate read and so you can have riddling and prozac crammed
[44:16.280 --> 44:19.880]  down your throat and drink fluoride water
[44:19.880 --> 44:24.040]  the report literally saturated with dehumanizing
[44:24.040 --> 44:27.160]  proposals is devoted entirely to the world bank's long
[44:27.160 --> 44:32.760]  term strategic strategies in regards to population control does not shy away
[44:32.760 --> 44:36.600]  from proposing the most draconian methods in order to depopulate the planet
[44:36.600 --> 44:40.760]  male and female sterilization iud's can be made
[44:40.760 --> 44:45.080]  more rapidly available through mobile facilities at sterilization vans in
[44:45.080 --> 44:50.040]  thailand they already had those in periodic camps such as the vasectomy
[44:50.040 --> 44:54.280]  and tube sectomy camps in india which they set up
[44:54.280 --> 44:58.760]  in iud safaris in indonesia that's where they just ride in and round you up
[44:58.760 --> 45:02.360]  they come in and give women in indonesia it came out just last year these shots
[45:02.360 --> 45:05.160]  and they all they literally throw nets on them
[45:05.160 --> 45:08.840]  taserum grab them and go here's your here's your shot
[45:08.840 --> 45:12.520]  uh for for tetanus and they have miscarriage the next day they're like
[45:12.520 --> 45:19.560]  ah that's how you black opum and i've got it it just goes on and on here
[45:19.560 --> 45:22.520]  and again that's what's so incredible about all this
[45:22.520 --> 45:28.360]  is that it's all public it's all going on right in front of everyone i am at
[45:28.360 --> 45:32.360]  world bank rock a feller documents hundreds and hundreds we publish them
[45:32.360 --> 45:38.360]  we link to them on a daily basis and the new york times comes out and says
[45:38.360 --> 45:41.560]  we're evil and and conspiracy theorists because we know how to read what
[45:41.560 --> 45:46.600]  they're doing oh here they are implementing it
[45:46.600 --> 45:49.640]  you saw california pass a law where they're going to shoot your 12-year-olds
[45:49.640 --> 45:52.360]  up with a garter sale shots that have been
[45:52.360 --> 45:55.400]  known to kill people but also have abortions without telling you
[45:55.400 --> 46:00.600]  and give you other vaccines in england they've gone one step further this
[46:00.600 --> 46:05.080]  other one in telegraph girls 13 given contraceptive implants at school
[46:05.080 --> 46:08.280]  girls as young as 13 have been fitted with contraceptive implants at school
[46:08.280 --> 46:11.640]  without their parents knowing and they're ordered to sign a decree
[46:11.640 --> 46:15.960]  that they'll be criminally charged if they tell their parents
[46:15.960 --> 46:19.400]  yeah i saw articles last year where all over the country they had
[46:19.400 --> 46:31.080]  third graders they chose and they taught them don't trust your parents
[46:31.080 --> 46:41.000]  they uh what was it about a year ago that came out and said to them
[46:41.000 --> 46:46.200]  we're going to put you all in a biometric database but don't tell mommy and daddy
[46:46.200 --> 46:51.800]  we're going to play james bond you're now spies
[46:51.800 --> 46:55.320]  and you're not going to let mommy and daddy know
[46:55.320 --> 46:59.080]  that we're face scanning and retina scanning and thumb printing and hand
[46:59.080 --> 47:03.560]  printing you and then when the parents came out
[47:03.560 --> 47:06.520]  and they caught them the police came around this is in the news and threatened
[47:06.520 --> 47:10.760]  the parents and said national security they take your blood at birth
[47:10.760 --> 47:15.080]  they put stuff in your water they play god they
[47:15.080 --> 47:20.520]  whoa let me continue with the article but it's caused a backlash from parents
[47:20.520 --> 47:23.080]  who weren't aware that their daughters had been fitted
[47:23.080 --> 47:27.000]  with the four cm device which said some of the skin
[47:27.000 --> 47:30.120]  and it's been linked to not just destroying fertility permanently i would add
[47:30.120 --> 47:34.360]  but also killing women's sexual desire it is currently unknown exactly how many
[47:34.360 --> 47:38.920]  youngsters have taken part in the scheme and it goes on in the article that
[47:38.920 --> 47:41.640]  they have the children sign a pledge they won't tell their parents and tell
[47:41.640 --> 47:44.680]  them we'll go to jail that's like a child molester when they rape a child they
[47:44.680 --> 47:47.960]  tell them now you'll go to jail or you'll get in trouble or i'll kill your
[47:47.960 --> 47:51.400]  puppy of course there is no law saying that but they say it's a
[47:51.400 --> 47:55.160]  confidentiality medical it's their medical privacy
[47:55.160 --> 47:59.320]  so it's medical privacy law which which they're lying they're just saying it's a
[47:59.320 --> 48:02.600]  law and then not letting the children tell their
[48:02.600 --> 48:08.680]  parents they're fraud here it is parents say they've been forced to
[48:08.680 --> 48:13.240]  inspect their child's arm for any sign of the implant
[48:13.240 --> 48:16.680]  and it goes on here let me find the part in the article they tell them that they
[48:16.680 --> 48:19.560]  don't have to face the embarrassment of going to see the doctor
[48:19.560 --> 48:23.160]  and it's all confidential so their mom doesn't need to know a thing
[48:23.160 --> 48:26.600]  they say the school and also gone over the counseling
[48:26.600 --> 48:31.000]  the family doctor i'm trying to find the part there's a part in here where they
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.200]  or maybe that bbc article jacobson showed this to me last night when i was
[48:34.200 --> 48:37.320]  up here working where they tell them don't tell your parents it's medical
[48:37.320 --> 48:41.880]  privacy you'll go to jail if you do i mean it is just so
[48:41.880 --> 48:47.320]  mind-blowing i just read to you where yale was run by a eugenicist obsessed
[48:47.320 --> 48:51.320]  with saving the british bloodline kitler was as well
[48:51.320 --> 48:55.800]  i just read to you with direct link to the 1984 development report
[48:55.800 --> 48:59.640]  in uh of the world bank in fact guys pull this up if you can and click on that
[48:59.640 --> 49:04.280]  first link so we can show it to people
[49:04.280 --> 49:08.280]  i mean again i know this information you know and i've got the rockefeller
[49:08.280 --> 49:12.200]  foundation documents from the 60s about steroids and vaccines
[49:12.200 --> 49:15.800]  they've been caught doing it they've been caught meeting a few years ago for
[49:15.800 --> 49:19.160]  depopulation and now because you're waking up
[49:19.160 --> 49:23.000]  to vaccines peri actually did get a law pass it
[49:23.000 --> 49:26.280]  isn't just an executive order
[49:28.120 --> 49:31.720]  saying if you want to go to college you got to take whatever vaccines they say
[49:31.720 --> 49:37.080]  it sets the precedent for just hundreds of these things to be pushed on you
[49:37.080 --> 49:40.920]  well you know what can the government pass a law that i've got to sacrifice my
[49:40.920 --> 49:45.400]  firstborn child on top of an altar at a pyramid because it was the law in the
[49:45.400 --> 49:50.280]  Aztec kingdom it was the law in most other cultures
[49:52.040 --> 49:57.960]  now there's the document good job it was the law
[49:58.760 --> 50:03.080]  the law of the king the law of the priest the druids
[50:03.080 --> 50:09.400]  to exercise authority would routinely demand the children of noblemen
[50:09.400 --> 50:15.960]  they would get them drunk on mead and a mixture of
[50:15.960 --> 50:18.840]  other chemicals
[50:19.880 --> 50:23.000]  what's the thing you hold over somebody's head to where they've got a
[50:23.000 --> 50:29.160]  kisha in the old uh what mistletoe yeah mistletoe and and and and honey
[50:29.160 --> 50:32.280]  liquor and they because the royalty got to be drunk
[50:32.280 --> 50:35.160]  before they killed them and then they'd hold them and
[50:35.160 --> 50:37.960]  bash their brains out and then slit their throat
[50:37.960 --> 50:42.200]  or they would put you in a big wicker
[50:42.200 --> 50:45.640]  burning man oh yeah that's how they did it and burn you up in it
[50:45.640 --> 50:49.480]  or throw you into a bonfire where we get the term bonfire
[50:49.480 --> 50:54.440]  all the germanic tribes 24-7 human sacrificing uh

[54:25.160 --> 54:32.120]  a fair loser or somebody you know who's real positive and above the fray but
[54:32.120 --> 54:38.520]  when there's fraud there's fraud also we've got huge developments on the
[54:38.520 --> 54:42.840]  Iran front i will get to that but Aaron Dykes just ran in here
[54:42.840 --> 54:47.240]  without even looking today this is what he ran into
[54:47.240 --> 54:50.760]  and now he's doing another search on the term undoubtedly whenever they do
[54:50.760 --> 54:54.360]  something like this it's a talking point so you'll see it everywhere
[54:54.360 --> 54:58.840]  and sure enough i was looking during the break and did find some more
[54:58.840 --> 55:04.760]  examples of it here is the Detroit news
[55:04.840 --> 55:07.960]  Detroit free press
[55:09.400 --> 55:16.120]  unbelievable Michigan is breeding poverty
[55:16.120 --> 55:21.640]  now listen to this since the national attention is on birth control
[55:21.640 --> 55:25.880]  here's my idea if we want to fight poverty reduce violent crime
[55:25.880 --> 55:29.080]  and bring down our embarrassing dropout rate we should swap
[55:29.080 --> 55:32.760]  contraceptives for fluoride in michigan's drinking water
[55:32.760 --> 55:36.440]  hey bubba sodium fluoride is a contraceptive
[55:36.440 --> 55:39.880]  and it attacks every organ in the body and gives you a seven-fold increase in
[55:39.880 --> 55:43.640]  cancer they're also proposing in other news
[55:43.640 --> 55:48.840]  outlets putting lithium in the water and statins again
[55:48.840 --> 55:51.880]  why not they're already forced drug genius and when you go get your city
[55:51.880 --> 55:54.760]  to vote to take the fluoride toxic waste out
[55:54.760 --> 55:58.680]  states like new jersey and arkansas just passed law saying it must be in there
[55:58.680 --> 56:02.200]  really cool can you pass a law saying hitler can throw
[56:02.200 --> 56:06.280]  jews into uh into into pits and shoot them
[56:06.280 --> 56:10.760]  or Stalin can throw ukrainians into pits and shoot them no
[56:10.760 --> 56:14.920]  you can pass laws all day i say they're null and void i say you're a fraud
[56:14.920 --> 56:18.840]  i say what the Aztecs did was a fraud now i may have been a crazy man
[56:18.840 --> 56:22.040]  a thousand years ago if i was teleported back to
[56:22.040 --> 56:25.960]  chichin itza in southern mexico in the yucatan and i and i could speak my
[56:25.960 --> 56:29.160]  and i said hey don't cut those children's hearts out
[56:29.160 --> 56:32.840]  today when the sun comes up the sun's a ball of gas it's not a god
[56:32.840 --> 56:36.840]  you don't need to kill your people of course the priests made their money off
[56:36.840 --> 56:40.200]  selling the meat in the square they'd be like hey we're making tax money off
[56:40.200 --> 56:43.400]  this this is our main meat product shut up
[56:43.400 --> 56:49.400]  see i'm the crazy man to the Aztecs just like if i was in nazi germany in 1940
[56:49.400 --> 56:53.160]  and said don't arrest all these people and put them in camps i'm the crazy bad
[56:53.160 --> 56:55.800]  man and see i happen to know they're already
[56:55.800 --> 56:59.480]  poisoning our water and i'm again the crazy
[56:59.480 --> 57:03.000]  bad man because in a land run by psychos
[57:03.000 --> 57:06.840]  people who aren't psychos are the bad men
[57:06.840 --> 57:10.280]  and again the dumb down who are already brain damage from this they're not
[57:10.280 --> 57:13.240]  going to listen to me they're going to laugh oh they're not doing this to us
[57:13.240 --> 57:16.680]  i'm speaking to those that are intelligent enough to
[57:16.680 --> 57:20.360]  avoid this now they're they're moving to make it to
[57:20.360 --> 57:23.240]  law to take shots and now it's the point of
[57:23.240 --> 57:26.520]  i'm going to defend myself and my family you're not going to assault me
[57:26.520 --> 57:32.200]  with that chemical slash bio weapon and again you shouldn't go to the
[57:32.200 --> 57:34.040]  university of texas because they've done this
[57:34.040 --> 57:39.400]  she my mother went there my dad went there my grandfather went there
[57:39.400 --> 57:43.000]  you can't go to ut you can't go to texas universities now
[57:43.000 --> 57:46.440]  because they're going to try to make you take all these shots
[57:46.440 --> 57:49.720]  you can't join the military because they do it they've been caught
[57:49.720 --> 57:53.240]  adding sterilants and cancer viruses i'm not debating the science of
[57:53.240 --> 57:55.320]  inoculation even though it's linked to increased
[57:55.320 --> 57:59.080]  cancer and shutting down your immune system separately
[57:59.080 --> 58:02.120]  if there was some deadly bio weapon out there and they had a vaccine that really
[58:02.120 --> 58:06.600]  protected you i'd take it except they're going to add a trojan horse
[58:06.600 --> 58:09.720]  you can't trust these people because their stated goal
[58:09.720 --> 58:13.800]  is to hurt you through the shots there's a reason cancer rates are over 2000
[58:13.800 --> 58:17.240]  percent and here they are saying since the
[58:17.240 --> 58:20.600]  poor people are dependent on government we have a right to sterilize them
[58:20.600 --> 58:24.040]  that's why they want to make you dependent is so they can then say well
[58:24.040 --> 58:27.320]  we're going to sterilize you now or take your kids now because you are
[58:27.320 --> 58:30.040]  dependent you've got to take all these vaccines when
[58:30.040 --> 58:33.480]  you're on welfare to get the welfare and in those shots
[58:33.480 --> 58:36.280]  they're given you cancer viruses and everything else
[58:36.280 --> 58:39.720]  you might
[58:43.160 --> 58:50.360]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[58:50.360 --> 58:53.560]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[58:53.560 --> 58:57.640]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[58:57.640 --> 59:01.400]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[59:01.400 --> 59:05.000]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[59:05.000 --> 59:09.240]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[59:09.240 --> 59:12.440]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[59:12.440 --> 59:15.080]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[59:15.080 --> 59:19.000]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.520]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[59:22.520 --> 59:25.640]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[59:25.640 --> 59:29.720]  damages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[59:29.720 --> 59:32.840]  insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power
[59:32.840 --> 59:36.440]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[59:36.440 --> 59:40.440]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[59:40.440 --> 59:43.640]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't
[59:43.640 --> 59:46.840]  own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[59:46.840 --> 59:56.840]  1-877-327-0365 waging war on corruption alex jones
[59:56.840 --> 01:00:00.520]  on the gcm radio network
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:10.120]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:16.520]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:22.440]  network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.800]  well the detroit news
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:33.080]  calls for putting sterilants in the water
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.280]  but of course it's the very same eugenesis that funded the giant dependent
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:42.440]  class so they could later get the general population this was decided in
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.960]  the 60s to support compulsory sterilization
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:51.000]  because of the giant welfare hordes it's always problem reaction solution

[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:06.680]  and make them ticking time bombs then demonize all the troops
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:11.000]  for what a small group of the military who've been psychologically
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:18.120]  traumatized do problem reaction solution problem reaction solution
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:21.560]  problem reaction solution the troops come back with the ptsd

[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:33.960]  military guy who's now in the sheriff's department who came to his house
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.920]  his seven-year-old daughter been late to class a few times
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:41.080]  forced his way in with the summons and then said where's your rifle she's
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.440]  she's not here well you're a liar and then says to the kids

[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.680]  and the cop says no and sits there in his house for 20 minutes without a warrant
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:06.040]  and of course the guy's former military i mean he's been kicking down doors in
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.920]  fallujah all day

[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:14.680]  head that that's how the military's been trained
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:18.920]  i'm not saying the military's bad but you have people in country five six seven
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:22.440]  years it's a laboratory to produce people that'll do
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.880]  anything and you bring them back here now they know a big percentage are
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:29.560]  patriots and are going to wake up so now you're the number one enemy
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:33.880]  those that they can use you're their little attack dog but the rest of you
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.760]  the 70% of so the studies show that aren't going to go along with the new
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:41.160]  world order you're the enemy so you better decide
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:45.240]  what side you're going to be on it's really that simple
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:50.520]  but i've had these uh you know military guys you can tell they're 25 30 years old
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:55.320]  and they'll have scars on their face you name it bow up on you flip out on you
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.560]  i'll say so when did you get out of the military

[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:02.040]  so that is coming up this sunday and then the next sunday
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:05.800]  i'm going to be in orlando florida and again
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.680]  that's definitely going to sell out because more than half is already sold
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:13.240]  and that's two weeks away uh the dallas should sell out it sold out last time it
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.600]  seats about 850 and they're more than half sold so
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:21.880]  info wars dot com forward slash events or you can call the orlando highlight or
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:25.240]  the lakewood theater in dallas and buy them over the phone as well just check
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:28.360]  information on i guess we should probably add the phone numbers there on
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:31.720]  the uh article but some people just aren't online
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:34.760]  we don't like to go online to do stuff like that so you can call and do it
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:39.080]  and i think most these places because it always happens i go you're sold out but
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:42.280]  there's a line of people out there well we hold five percent of the tickets back
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:45.800]  and then they put out folding chairs and stuff like that
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.960]  i look forward to seeing you out there and uh i'm going to try to do clips for
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:53.640]  the nightly news on the road i'll be doing the show uh every day on the road
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:57.080]  i'm yet to ask mike adams to fill in next monday
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:00.440]  when i'm on the road uh if he wants to do that because i'm going to go on the road
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:04.520]  from sunday to that sunday i just cannot
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:10.280]  subject myself to the tsa very often because of
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:15.080]  when i was fat dumb and happy and and and not running five six seven miles a day
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:19.640]  i could i could i could put up with with potbelly people barking at me but
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:24.840]  i just am so aggressive right now that uh i just can't handle it
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:29.240]  uh and i should be able to handle it i'm sure i'll fly again soon it's just it
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:33.560]  i've still got my humanity and i know they're torps working for people putting
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:36.520]  poison in our water and it makes me really mad
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:41.720]  the government is jacking the water with over 200 chemicals on average and over
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.720]  90 percent of the epa zone scientists in 2000
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:50.920]  2004 2006 and last year sent letters to their bosses saying
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:56.280]  mercury lead arsenic hundreds of other chemicals sodium fluoride huge cancer
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:59.800]  increases dental for roses take it out and they're told
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:03.960]  shut up or you'll be demoted i mean it's not the government isn't even bad
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:08.280]  the rank and file it's the leadership of it the leadership
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:12.600]  is a bunch of dirty eugenicists and now they're getting to the open point of
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:16.280]  we're going to sterilize you of your own welfare really since
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:19.880]  since the eugenicists brought out welfare it's created the illegitimacy in
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:22.920]  the baby factories which was actually part of their plan
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:26.600]  to have a giant underclass that's dependent on them that they can
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:31.160]  engineer however they want and play off against the middle class and rich
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:34.120]  but you notice they're forcing the rich to take vaccines to get into college
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.040]  they're putting it in the rich people's water the average good old boy worth 10
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:41.800]  million dollars didn't get a memo not to eat gmo
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:45.640]  but i read the articles yesterday where the entire leader on record will not
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:50.440]  eat gmo the monsanto cafeterias
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.280]  it's come out in the news this week have banned gmo because their own scientists
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:58.520]  will not eat it and then i learned that that just got leaked and confirmed
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:02.280]  that this has been going on for 12 years since 1999
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:06.520]  i found a london independent article on it
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:11.400]  let me say that again all these eugenicists bill gates queen of england
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:15.240]  who openly say they want to kill the majority of the population and who fund
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:19.240]  programs to make you eat gmo and not label it and make you take shots are
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:22.360]  all on record developing things to be piggybacked on shots
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:26.200]  to sterilize you and give you cancer and they won't eat their food or drink the
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:29.560]  fluoride water and the german government won't take the vaccines
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:34.760]  and their own military has given a quote clean vaccine bbc associated press
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:38.280]  can you put it's not even two plus two equals four
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:41.800]  it is looking at the number one like a two-year-old
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:47.480]  and saying one what letter is that a it's not even two plus two it's not even
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:51.160]  two plus two it's not even two plus two it's not
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:57.800]  even one plus one the globalist openly are killing us
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:01.480]  and the cancer is exploding everything else is exploding
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:04.760]  the un's taking over they're announcing world government publicly
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:08.360]  and there are articles out today demonizing me saying i'm insane there's
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:12.520]  no new world order no global government
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:16.280]  i mean that's mind control again i want to say something the military the
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.000]  police that the system plans until they get all their
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.040]  drones and robots in place to be their enforcers you're being killed
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:27.720]  i see articles all the time where his mom thought you know
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:31.640]  bill be safe joining the military at 18 he was just going to be in the
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:36.760]  maintenance of tanks armored vehicles but at 21 he died of lung cancer and
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:41.240]  kidney failure from du even the doctors at the
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:48.520]  university medical center said it was du but the va says it's not
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:56.120]  the pentagon never allowed the use of du until 1990 because they'd have to
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:00.200]  throw away the tanks that used it it ignites when you fire it
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:04.600]  why do they have the troops using it you're all dead
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:08.040]  i mean do you get this is armageddon in slow motion
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:12.600]  this is mass extermination this is a holocaust against everyone
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:16.840]  it's going on now and they're now making their move everywhere going having
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:20.520]  kids is bad for your carbon footprint we're going to tax you for having kids
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:23.320]  we're going to home inspect you you can't have a water well

[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:29.080]  put fluoride tablets in it or we're going to shut down your well the police
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:32.200]  are going to come we're going to shut down the amish
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:36.200]  we're going to make you take vaccines we're going to have your little little
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.720]  kid you're you know you're 11 or 12 year old having abortion and not tell mommy
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:44.680]  or have birth control tablets injected under their skin
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:50.520]  it is they're making their move folks they're in the news all over the place
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:53.880]  saying sterilize people
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:00.600]  all right i'm done i'm going to go to break and come back with your calls
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:03.560]  i'm going to shut up it's just how do you have this information
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:06.920]  and not tell people we told you they'd implode the world economy and set up
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:10.120]  global austerity jacking up taxes shutting everything down
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:13.960]  and then people beg even more for what crumbs are left the government takes
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:17.320]  our money gives it to mega banks and uses the rest to social
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:21.080]  engineer us and tell us how to live our lives
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:25.080]  it is so frustrating to watch these criminals get away with this
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:30.600]  and it goes on and on and on but all we've got to do is realize that 99.9
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:35.560]  percent of us are under attack by this and it's all an open conspiracy but
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:38.680]  again people are afraid to bring down the system
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:41.640]  the globalists are already bringing down the old system to bring in a horrible
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.920]  new one while it's in flux while the new evil systems
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:49.640]  totally taking over it's better to bring this system down
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:53.080]  may the heavens fall justice be done may the heavens fall
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:56.200]  those of you that say well this corruption is real i've seen universities say
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.400]  that but we can't expose it or bring the whole system down the system is death

[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:09.880]  killed a lot of you have sons and daughters of
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:13.000]  military who were involved in maintenance they died young or they're
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.480]  super sick they got kidney failure you don't know why
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:21.640]  the globalist killed him and i think you should take that person
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:25.880]  all right i'm going to your calls shan and arizona welcome thanks for holding
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:29.560]  uh welcome can you hear me alex i'm calling from the middle of a ranch here
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:32.120]  loud and loud and clear when you sound like you're calling from next to me go
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:35.960]  ahead make this point with you since i talked with you last
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:39.560]  and you know i've been in this movement uh since i was 16 or 17 as i've
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:41.960]  chatted with you before and i've been listening
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:46.360]  to you for two years but the key to understanding all of this
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:49.800]  as you know and as you rightfully say all the time is
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:57.000]  eugenics because in reality uh mr jones all that which you talk about and
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.520]  what joys talks about and all the different facets
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:05.480]  of how they're undermining our freedom and have for decades and even a couple
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:08.920]  centuries the people of this network these are the
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:12.680]  minions of the anachronist and the problem is
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:17.240]  is and the tragedy in this country being founded on christian principles is
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:20.920]  that this this should be talked from the pulpit the
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:25.560]  preachers should be uh screaming but we now have state-run
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:28.680]  religion because they tricked the churches to become
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:32.360]  uh these charities instead of being first amendment
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:35.800]  churches they trick them oh you're supposed to sign this form now because
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:39.080]  you're a charity and they trick them into the contract
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:43.080]  it's like animal id premises id tricks you to give up your property rights
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:46.120]  it's all about tricking you into the contract they're con artists
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:49.320]  but a contract that's a fraud is still null and void
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:53.400]  and yes most the churches are government funded now
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:57.080]  at the top and on record are spying on their flocks if your new listener just
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:01.160]  search the term clergy response teams you'll see the documents the newscast
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:05.000]  where they admit your preacher is spying on you over a hundred thousand
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.920]  of the churches now major churches are actually spying on their flock
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:12.440]  they've given manuals on how to deal with dissenters we basically have like
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:15.080]  what the communist chinese have a government run
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:19.240]  church in this country and you're right even if you don't believe in the devil
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:22.680]  this might as well be the devil running this it's that murderous
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:27.400]  that diabolical yes yes a couple other quick points
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:31.560]  you were talking about um the our forefathers and i'm going to i'm going
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:35.880]  to say the high english that they spoke this has to do with ron paul and i
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:39.000]  wish he'd say some different things pertaining to his foreign policy but
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.840]  you and i both know that the policy of neutralism
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:46.840]  is what was started with washington it is farewell address
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:50.680]  and the globalist twisted that out during world war one's time
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:54.920]  and turn that word into ice and isolationism as a negative effect but i
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:58.760]  have a copy of that speech anybody can get a little book
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:02.360]  you can get it from out rush more with washington's uh writings including the
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:06.200]  farewell address and you know what it's in a high english
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:10.120]  and i've been literate at a very early age it's very difficult to read i find
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:14.200]  myself reading over it many many times and still not getting
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:18.120]  uh... by the way the globalist communicate the globalist communicate
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:22.200]  in a quasi high english there they've even done themselves down from the level
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:25.880]  but yeah you're right now it's it's it's it's hard to read
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:29.160]  and they weren't doing it to try to impress anybody it's that they're
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:31.480]  trying to show the complexities in language
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:35.400]  to really give depth to what they're saying
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:39.080]  really the other thing i wish ron paul would explain one of those people
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:43.320]  uh it was it was uh washington who said if you want peace
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:46.520]  prepare for war he knew about a strong defense defense
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:49.640]  but as jefferson the quote from jefferson as you know
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:53.720]  is let us no more uh let we don't we don't want it
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:57.960]  i'm loose now i'm ad-libbing it but basically stay away from the countries
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:02.200]  of europe because they are nations of perpetual warfare
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:07.000]  they understood that the rough child child banks the five banks of europe
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.600]  kept pitting one nation after another and the tragedy
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:15.000]  tragedy is we've become imperialistic no you're right shon shon i appreciate
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.080]  your your points they're excellent we're going to break come back with more
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:19.320]  calls in the long segment but no that's it
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:23.800]  it was always empires trying to get other countries in in alliances
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:26.840]  and he he was following what switzerland had done
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:30.040]  george washington was he said hey let's just stay out of it
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:34.200]  let's just be friends sell everybody products
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:38.760]  and they learned that in new york it it was a city that traded with everybody
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:43.480]  and so it's the same thing again everything ron paul talks about is pure
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:45.640]  george washington and that's why they hate him
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:50.040]  they hate what america really is and what made it great
[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:53.880]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:30:00.760]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:04.200]  a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:07.960]  into why even if i had a pretty good size meal that i was still starving
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:12.200]  and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:15.400]  grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:20.360]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:23.960]  trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:27.880]  fight off cancer and be healthy i then searched out the best

[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:49.160]  but we'll never lose heart we can't just wait for the old
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:55.640]  okay well somebody is in the bumper music i sure didn't put this in there
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:59.000]  but uh whatever doesn't matter they're poisoning our water and our food
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.800]  because they love us because they're the little control freaks that see us as
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:05.640]  scum animals that have to be killed i'm gonna go back to your calls but
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:09.320]  erin just ran in with this fox news report
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:12.840]  prostate cancer may be linked to birth control pills
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:17.880]  in water supply g uh all over the western world it's just causing the
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:24.040]  frogs the amphibians uh reptiles and fish to develop cancer
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:29.320]  deformities and to be bisexual and it's admitted that men all
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:32.760]  over the western world have incredible estrogen levels
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:37.480]  which is giving men prostate cancer and men are growing breast and all the
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:41.240]  rest of it uh and confusing their sexuality
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:45.560]  and that's all admitted here uh but the globalists just say that's the way it
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:48.280]  is and of course it then gives women breast cancer
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:54.120]  because it causes all sorts of hormonal problems uh in different sexual tissues
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:58.600]  but don't forget media matters made a big joke out of it when i warned that
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:02.520]  it was reducing men's fertility and attacking our prostates
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:06.440]  and confusing sexual identity and making women go into puberty early and
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:09.640]  giving them breast cancer hyper feminizes women
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:13.720]  feminizes men they just said i was bashing gay people
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:17.640]  and then they had all the big gay news sites attack me and say i'm
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:21.720]  i hate them okay uh look look i don't hate the frogs
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:25.240]  that have had their sexuality confused by this i mean i i've shown you the
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:28.840]  Planned Parenthood imf world blank documents just a few weeks ago
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:31.800]  where they said they would put chemicals in the food and water
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:35.720]  to confuse your sexuality and make you not be attracted to women
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:39.160]  and to affect the uptake in your olfactory nerve uh through these
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:42.440]  hormonal imbalances you know the scent of a woman the
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:48.040]  look of a woman but again um it's like the uh
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:52.200]  last man on earth with Vincent Price he's there trying to give him the cure
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:56.040]  and he's like they did it to you i have the cure they're like shut up
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:59.560]  throw the spear right at him or i guess you could use the omega
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:03.400]  man analogy a remake of that with charlton heston
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:06.200]  i said that's one of the few things i savor is that i've interviewed charlton
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:10.600]  heston i love charlton heston movies great actor
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:14.200]  okay uh side issue here look look look i'm not
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:18.360]  obsessed with people's sexual activities like a lot of folks that
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:22.360]  bash people that do that my point is it's scientific so the family has ended
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:26.680]  humanity is in a big petri dish being manipulated like animals that's how the
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:29.400]  globalists see us and as long as we play along with their
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:32.280]  little false reality as long as we do that they're going to keep
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:35.960]  winning but uh here it is prostate
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:39.240]  cancer may be linked to birth control how many videos and articles that i
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:45.320]  write years ago about this telling you about it saying exactly that because i
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:48.280]  have the studies there's nothing new about this
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:52.360]  and then i've got the detroit news saying put it in the water to sterilize
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:54.680]  people
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:58.360]  countries with the highest numbers of women use oral contraceptives have the
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:01.960]  highest rates of death from prostate cancer a new study finds
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:06.760]  yeah what why do they put you on uh sol paul meadow and other things that boost
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:10.440]  testosterone and then it's funny when people start
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:16.680]  getting prostate cancer they actually tell you to uh to uh to uh
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:22.440]  lower your testosterone which some of the studies i've seen actually lowers
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:27.320]  the size of the of the prostate it's the estrogen's doing it
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:31.320]  but again they want feminized men now despite the fact they're jacking your
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:36.440]  food and water if you work out hard uh and do full body exercises
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:40.280]  it will boost your testosterone but more and more i used to bash the police for
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:43.640]  taking testosterone and other anabolic steroids
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:47.400]  mimickers and then of course i've seen police chiefs admit that their forces
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:49.480]  are taking steroids and that they recommend it
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:53.320]  like the police chief in um fort worth last year said
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:57.480]  but men have lower testosterone they did just 20 years ago
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:01.560]  so i i understand why that's happening i want to ask police though why i read
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:04.280]  articles about embusting other people taking steroids
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:07.960]  i'm not saying you should take high levels of them i mean for somebody like me who
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:11.000]  has naturally high levels i certainly don't need them
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.120]  but but but for the average men out there that that don't even act like
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:18.120]  women women are all fired up on estrogen their brain picks it up
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:21.720]  and uses you know pretty much similar to testosterone the women are all
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:25.640]  wild and crazed the men are all metrosexual putting makeup on
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:28.680]  you know running around enjoying themselves it's all part of a sickening
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:32.920]  chemical attack by the globalist on record i have all the documents
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:35.960]  just all part of the total assault by these criminals they learn not to just
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:40.200]  line you up and shoot you they just jack your food and water and sneak off
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:43.000]  countries with the highest numbers of women use oral contraceptives have the
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.800]  highest rates of death from prostate cancer new study finds
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:49.480]  birth control pills contain a female hormone estrogen and in recent years
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:52.040]  some experts have raised concerns about the presence of estrogen
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:54.920]  and similar compounds and foods in the water supply
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:58.440]  the new study may raise those concerns further
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:01.480]  through the authors said the findings are preliminary no they're not
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:05.320]  and it goes through the big studies from pill to prostate now let me stop right
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:07.560]  there
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:13.400]  if you go back to a study what in 2009 the epa even did it in over a hundred
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:17.480]  cities dallas was one of them dfw well the whole area was tested
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:20.920]  they found levels of riddling prozac and estrogen
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:24.840]  hundreds of times what could be in sewage runoff
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:28.200]  and let me give you the big announcement from that data and go look at that for
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:31.400]  yourself and they admitted these are strange findings we're retesting
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:34.280]  that this is way off the chart this isn't
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:38.760]  this isn't trace and it's in the original precursor
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:43.480]  then they found it was generic fluoride based chemical weapon prozac
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:47.320]  they're putting it in the water duh and now that they know
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:51.000]  you're that that that that that we're exposing them you notice they're now in
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.600]  the news announcing oh hey uh we want to put prozac
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:01.560]  and lithium and statins in the water
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:10.360]  you see how that works again i'm telling you i'm telling you
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.880]  and i love the little servants of the system because you work for the system
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:16.360]  low level you think the system's good and i'm a liar
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:20.120]  every time i'm at a rally and they got cops forming around us you know bugging
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:23.320]  their eyes out like it's able to have the first amendment i tell them i say hey
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:25.640]  guys you know they put stuff in the water and
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:28.040]  they'll start laughing sometimes they don't laugh
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:31.800]  i'm like hey it's not funny they do see it's not funny
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:36.200]  when you die 20 years early it's not funny when a 25 year old
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:41.320]  a guy in tank maintenance or 21 year old you know dies a lung cancer at 25 it's
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:45.560]  not funny diane's not funny i know they got you
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:48.520]  scared of ied's and terrorists under every table and you know the
[01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:51.480]  government's there to keep you safe from them that's all for the martial law
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:55.400]  takeover but you know what bring the martial law bring the hot war i don't
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:57.240]  want that to happen but if it's going to happen whatever
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:00.600]  because they're already killing us anyways people ask why do you have
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:04.040]  courage to fight them if they're such killers because i'm dead already my
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:08.120]  children have no future if we don't beat these people
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:10.840]  because the globalists are saying they're testing and they're jacking in the
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:15.080]  water and the food and the vaccines has been moving too slowly
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:19.720]  the globalists are saying they're getting ready to gear this sucker up
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:23.080]  they got plans on the books to have drones flower every city and spray bio
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:26.120]  or chemical weapons on us that's even been leaked i've shown you the
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:28.440]  documents
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.440]  oh a government that did tens of thousands of tests all over the world
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:36.840]  killing children and women and men including healthy men women and children
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:39.640]  just to create cadres of scientists they knew would follow orders
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:43.560]  they wouldn't do something like that these are nice people no
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:48.520]  these are demons who've been selected out of the ranks
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:54.120]  who get off on the idea of let me tell you something there's
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:58.280]  nothing more devastating than nerds
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:03.400]  most of these people are highly intelligent what you call nerds
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:06.360]  who got picked on who got turned down by women
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:10.360]  and now they run giant computer companies they run biotech companies
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:15.640]  uh they've intermarried with elite families and they enjoy killing you
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:19.320]  they love that raw power when they walk down the street they look at what they've
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:22.280]  done to you they look at your gray or greenish skin
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:25.960]  you know your your your your unhealthy skin they look at the death numbers
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:29.560]  and it's a satisfaction for them i see bill gates on the news when he's doing
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:32.680]  something or when he's giving a speech about reducing population
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:36.200]  he puts his his his lower lip up at the top and does like a frown but it's a
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:39.560]  satisfaction you can see it in his eyes in fact i'll give you a bill gates look
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:41.880]  right now
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:45.720]  it's an emperor palpatine look when darth vader finds out his wife's gotten
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:49.560]  killed and goes no and gets all sad you look at emperor palpatine played by
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:52.040]  that great actor and he's getting off on it
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:58.040]  bill gates constantly is going hmm i mean it's oh boy it's sick i mean he is
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:00.600]  up there just
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:04.520]  i mean just seething with superpower folks that's a super
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:09.560]  super mega killer right there and he enjoys it he enjoys every minute of it
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:12.920]  they print they enjoy it warren bethlett ted turner
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:16.440]  head turner gave that speech at the national press club or was a national
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:20.200]  press club awards dinner and he said we gotta use the useless feeders and
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:23.640]  eaters there's we get rid of nine percent of them and started
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:27.720]  using mild profanities and then people were clapping the the so-called ruling
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:31.320]  class even reporters who were nobodies in this system
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:35.240]  they get off on it's like i'm at the table we're killing people
[01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:40.360]  this is really cool legions of little chicken necks
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:44.200]  the world isn't run by people with big muscles and swords anymore
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:47.560]  and the biggest meanest guy in the room is going to be king it's run by the
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:51.720]  psych warfare egghead 200 iq eugenicistic
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:56.200]  stermanist and they're hardcore and they mean business
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:00.360]  you understand that they mean business they rule this earth they've created a
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:03.240]  false reality basically and the final vestiges
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:06.920]  of the old system are fading away right now they're bringing in the internet
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:10.280]  censorship worldwide every day all over the world google
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:13.240]  twitter they're all working with governments to shut down free speech
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:16.440]  they're gearing up the massive prisons they're getting ready the giant new
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:20.120]  wars they're rolling it all out
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:26.760]  for the global feast of of wars bio weapons death extermination
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:30.600]  and all of the servants of the system most of the people that you see on the
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:34.360]  news serving it they're all going to be dead too
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:39.560]  and they're going to yell and scream and beg if this stuff gets released
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:43.000]  and they're thinking about releasing it that's why i'm not for a violent
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.120]  revolution against these guys because they'll just release super bio weapons
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:48.840]  and go to their bunkers you got to have an intellectual
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:52.280]  revolution throughout the system where their own technicians are aware of it
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:55.240]  and we only got 10 years before everything's drone and robot and the
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:45:02.040]  globalists are going to be able to hit a button even if the military says no
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:06.040]  now if you're watching this later after all this unfolds if we don't stop it
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:11.880]  we tried our best um and it'll have to be an internal revolution within the
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:15.080]  globalist to turn this around but i think we can probably still turn this
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:18.360]  around all right i'm going to shut up let's go to john in wisconsin then
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:22.600]  tyler mike mark and others john in wisconsin go ahead

[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:15.960]  um big proponent of it and i've talked to people in your office about it before
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:20.440]  even offered to send you uh one of my old roku boxes but i think you guys have a
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:25.480]  few around the shop now um i i have a couple of questions for you on some
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:29.240]  some just some research that i have not been able to find
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:33.080]  in the past but uh just to preface that i am uh
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:38.120]  i do have full spectrum awareness and uh total information analysis abilities
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:43.560]  and i think every one of your listeners either new or old can get to that point
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:47.080]  just doing a little research on their own even if they're a new listener it's
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:51.080]  like a jigsaw puzzle that has 80 of the pieces and it gets real
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:54.200]  simple and it's and once you realize what they're
[01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:56.760]  doing it's that you see them all over the place
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:47:00.280]  and you see the power trips they're on uh but go ahead and ask me the questions
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:04.760]  the stuff you can't find yeah and and and also i i just want to
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:09.160]  say that i have 40 plus employees i have purchased uh i just
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:12.840]  got a shipment of 200 of your uh citizens rule books a few weeks
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:15.640]  back i got all of your dvds in the package
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:19.320]  special and now i kind of lend them out they just write down the box
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:24.360]  and um anyway um uh and also ben puke's has really helped
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:27.160]  my family in their nutritional endeavors as well
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:34.840]  um my questions actually are um which um fbi or ca official
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:39.000]  was it that said most conspiracies are real i can't find that
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  do you remember that i don't remember saying that
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.920]  okay i thought maybe it was what was the exact quote
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:51.560]  i thought it was most conspiracies like basically he was saying
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:55.880]  uh that he thought his time was limited and i don't know if it was uh
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:48:00.920]  the the midnight canoeist that got waxed from the cia or if it was gonderson
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:03.880]  said most conspiracies believe it or not are real
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:08.520]  no no i i do remember a similar quote by i was at kasey
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:12.600]  who was the guy that drowned in the canoe of the kayak i've talked to folks
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:15.880]  that knew him and he had been blowing the whistle on stuff
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:19.240]  he was reportedly the guy that uh that leaked that flare footage of him
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:22.920]  killing branch dividends reportedly some folks didn't like that i'm going for
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:25.400]  memory here i'll have to pull it up what was the other question
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:28.680]  that was william colby colby colby colby yeah
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:32.440]  colby was found uh they ruled it uh an accident
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:36.200]  after canoeing at midnight with all it was half of his pajamas on and food
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:39.800]  burning on the stove anyway then there was uh another
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:44.840]  um question on is there a comprehensive list of all of the
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:51.320]  um bullet points of of uh watch points put out by dhs fbi
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:56.520]  um whatever adl or myaq no all they do is they have the adl mainly in southern
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:59.800]  poverty law center right it i mean if you look it's the same text word for word
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:03.320]  that's in their public reports they just put out even more demonization

[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:16.280]  and so that's why they just dictate to us and lie to us
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:19.880]  even when we catch them lying they just keep doing it because they're
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:26.120]  following a program and it's going to take fully awakening because to
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:29.400]  wake up you got admit there's a global dictatorship forming

[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.360]  water as much as they can and trying to block people from getting
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:40.680]  non-gmo while lobbying us all day how they're the
[01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:44.120]  environmentalists who are concerned about carbon dioxide
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:47.720]  which they just use as a power grab see they're able to take over because they
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:51.400]  always control the major opposition
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:54.440]  and i want to tell people that serve the system at the mid-level who know a
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:57.800]  little bit about this i mean you're destroying your own future

[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:26.200]  i really care about you well for a brother
[01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:30.760]  alec thank you i've called today basically
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:38.040]  to follow up with you on the proposed uh social networking website that you
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:41.720]  uh said that you were planning i always get busy on other projects but i'm
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:44.840]  going to march back there funny you call about this and talk to my t people and
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:47.960]  say look everything else goes on hold till this happens
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:51.240]  because there's some kind of idea or culture this happens everywhere when
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:54.760]  something isn't finished or done it's like almost like well the tribe has
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:59.080]  deemed this isn't going to happen at a subconscious level because it's seen as
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:03.240]  more work to do it is going to happen we're going to launch it
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:10.280]  alex i thought uh my call was really uh the impetus of it within me is in
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:13.880]  relationship to the ron paul campaign and how this would
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:17.960]  supercharge that campaign as well as spread the publicity
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:20.360]  yeah would have been nice if we had it would have been nice but we were just
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:23.720]  finishing all the other work i have a tendency to take on more projects than
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:27.080]  i can finish and let other people stick projects in front of me that aren't my
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:30.760]  project i understand that alec but uh i can't
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:35.880]  think of anything else at this point given the uh situation with ron paul
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:39.160]  campaign being stymied in the mass media as well
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:45.560]  is being stymied even more importantly uh at the voting booth so to speak in these
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:49.080]  primary there's been fraud everywhere and people say why does alex support the
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:52.600]  campaign but say there's fraud because he's gone
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:55.880]  from getting 10 percent to getting 20 30 percent
[01:57:55.880 --> 01:58:00.200]  he's clearly in first or second place and the fraud's being evidenced
[01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:03.240]  you got to send ron paul in there like a probe droid
[01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:07.800]  to take enemy fire to to show the enemy's position and what they're doing
[01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:11.560]  and to grow the movement so the only way you lose is not fighting
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:15.080]  but these crooks are criminals of course they're going to cheat of course
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:20.200]  they're going to steal alex in the old days uh to dispute for a
[01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:23.800]  candidate to dispute the results of the voting
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:27.800]  was normal and i think that ron paul should do that take him into court
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:31.560]  and let the social networking website go to work
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:35.320]  and i hear you look i hear you i appreciate your call

[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:39.880]  and you know i actually received an email an interesting email
[02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:44.600]  from the campaign manager of ron paul within the last day or so here
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:48.280]  talking about how they're going to be challenging you know the vote in main
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:52.360]  and so you know we need to move beyond that we also need to solve the problem
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:56.440]  by getting a glass beagle act in place just like here i guessed
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:59.400]  you know from a few days ago i talked about so what was the email saying
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:03.000]  specifically though um well if you if you don't mind i can get
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.760]  into it here it says tonight i saw a dueling examples of how much the
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:09.880]  establishment is scared of ron paul and his message of liberty
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:14.360]  ron paul will will win the most delegates out of main tonight in fact
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:18.520]  he will probably even win the beauty contest straw poll the media has already
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:22.360]  called for mit romney even before all the votes have been tallyed
[02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:26.280]  how can that be you might be asking yourself simple the national political
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:29.880]  establishment and their pals and the national media will do anything to
[02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:34.840]  silence the message of liberty it is up to you i'm sorry it is up to you and me
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:38.440]  to stop them and you know that includes you alex and me and you know we're all
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:41.640]  out here doing this together so you know i appreciate the effort
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:46.520]  and uh you know i think it's safe to say that the audience of this radio show
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:49.960]  and i think i've covered like five ron paul stories already today
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:52.680]  i think and i'm glad ron paul supporters are calling in
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:56.760]  lobbying my show and campaigning on my show but i mean i think it's safe to
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:00.920]  say we've been behind ron paul i've been behind ron paul for 17 years it's
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:06.280]  now 17 years on air i'd been on local radio with a saturday night
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:10.360]  show for about a month when i was able to get ron paul on because his district
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:14.600]  then came to south austin and uh so i've been interviewing ron paul
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:19.000]  for 17 years and i'm supporting him as best i can
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.880]  and have done just all sorts of things i mean i have
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:25.480]  packs on you know to promote what they're doing so people can get behind them
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:30.280]  uh and and i agree that ron paul has come further than most of us ever thought he
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:33.640]  would and uh it's just an example of the dinosaur
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:37.880]  media losing its power that despite the fact they put in everything they can
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:40.760]  they're still having trouble suppressing ron paul
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:44.120]  uh you know and he's doing another money bomb tomorrow too actually a
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:46.520]  fountain day money bomb i don't i think i've heard you
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:50.200]  mentioned that yet but for all of you ron paul supporters if you weren't aware
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:53.240]  uh you know tomorrow's another big day for us yeah we did you know he had a
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:55.400]  money bomb over the weekend we linked to that are you
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:57.800]  are you saying i'm not supporting ron paul
[02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:01.240]  oh absolutely not alex i know that you you know you're the one that's leading
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:04.840]  this charge here and i just really want everyone to be fully aware of the
[02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:08.040]  things you know we really need to front all these issues and and really take
[02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:10.840]  everything on no i hear you i hear you i appreciate your call
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:15.880]  you know i had lou rockwell on and we spent like almost an hour on ron paul
[02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:19.640]  and how we should get behind him and supporting just a few days ago
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:24.760]  uh i constantly talk about ron paul uh you know at a certain point though for a
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:28.520]  news radio show i can't just talk about ron paul
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:34.840]  um also i'm gonna be honest with you i like ron paul
[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:40.040]  i support him but all these admissions that they're putting poison in the water
[02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:44.680]  given his cancer bigger than ron paul and and you know ron paul is the old
[02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:47.480]  generation fighting the new rulers and a great job
[02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:51.400]  he doesn't get into the eugenics and stuff i've got to tell people

[02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:21.560]  give us his take on the iran situation the syria situation
[02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:26.680]  moves towards a police state as well as 911 truth
[02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:31.720]  but there's a new article out at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:37.000]  obama to unleash truth teams to counter negative campaign coverage
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:40.840]  remember the newscast four years ago where they in missouri and other areas
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:46.360]  had truth teams truth squads that would call the police and have you arrested
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:50.440]  if you lied about obama they had cops on the news with straight faces going
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:54.920]  we'll be arresting those that say he's not a christian
[02:08:54.920 --> 02:09:00.840]  well lying even if people were lying uh or were mistaken is is adjudicated in a
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:07.320]  judicial court um it is adjudicated in a civil court
[02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:10.680]  and you don't have police arresting you because they say you're lying
[02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:15.480]  so it's all part of the intimidation and steve watson's got a great article on
[02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:18.840]  this but i think i'm going to call him up and have him try to find that youtube
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:22.760]  video of uh obama truth squads people that
[02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:25.480]  criticize people that lie about obama to be arrested
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:28.200]  guys type that and you'll find the four-year-old article
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:33.080]  search it under web and you'll find it there uh
[02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:36.840]  it's just incredible newscast a bunch of states we're saying we're going to
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:40.760]  arrest you if you talk bad about him because talking bad about him is lying
[02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:44.840]  gop describes squad of supporters as propaganda team
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:51.000]  to deceive voters well i've seen a lot of lying by bill clinton by
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:54.840]  george bush by all of them but yeah obama's a new level
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:59.400]  i mean he says don't sign the ndaa it affects citizens
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:03.160]  and then it you turns out he demanded that section be added for him to be a
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:07.560]  dictator basically and then he said he wouldn't sign it and then he did sign it
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:11.640]  i mean just lies within lies within lies within lies
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:16.120]  where he comes out and says the um stimulus package a few years ago
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:20.280]  didn't give money to special interest and then it turned out it did
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:23.560]  and then he blamed senator dodd at the time for it and dodd brought out the
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:27.320]  letter where obama said he wouldn't sign it if that wasn't in there
[02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:31.960]  i mean he is a rubber stamp for the globalist
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:35.240]  and the the stuff they load his teleprompter with
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:39.480]  is total lies and he knowingly gets up there in lies
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:43.320]  but again he's just an actor he's just a he's a nobody just like bush was
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:46.360]  obama to unleash truth teams to counter negative coverage
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:51.000]  yeah these are a truth teams and it goes through all of it abc news is
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.960]  reporting it oh he actually did have it it's actually
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:57.480]  in the article steve did at it steve's so good
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:01.800]  one obama truth squad in missouri vowed to arrest anyone telling lies about
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:04.440]  obama
[02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:08.440]  and acted to otherwise intimidate anyone criticizing him
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:13.160]  or his policies yeah there it is and then you click the article
[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:17.000]  and it brings up uh the info wars dot com article
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:23.960]  from three and a half four years ago titled who's afraid of the big bad truth
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:29.960]  and sure enough there it is but never fear they have the independent watch
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:33.560]  dog that's nonpartisan funded by obama and uh
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:38.280]  george soros because they're independent investigation media matters
[02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:41.960]  conspires with white house to influence news progressive
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:46.520]  government mouthpiece routinely attacks alice jones ron paul
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:49.720]  of course even calling themselves progressive isn't is a lie an
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:53.160]  investigation by the daily caller has confirmed that the leftist organization
[02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:57.080]  media matters which routinely attacks alice jones in the info wars
[02:11:57.080 --> 02:12:00.440]  is an obama administration front the strategizes with the white house
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:03.720]  on a weekly basis on how to influence and direct the media
[02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:08.520]  i remember walking through a grocery store three years ago
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:13.080]  and seeing obama's enemies list on the cover of a newspaper and i read my name
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:16.760]  in there i'm like wow then i confirm through a source i'm indeed on an
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:22.120]  enemy's list huge fbi file uh you name it
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:25.880]  and then they had all these magazines and nightline come out and say i'm evil
[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:28.680]  and going to cause violence and all it did was give us more
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:32.840]  credibility because these were just such discredited liars
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:35.880]  but it is creepy i mean what are they going to try next
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:40.760]  because the media matters out of the top 10 people they attack
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:44.600]  i'm right in the middle i mean i'm attacked on a weekly basis
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:48.200]  other folks they attack on a monthly basis there's only a few people they
[02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:52.280]  attack on a daily basis i'm on a weekly basis and and again
[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:57.720]  it's not that i don't mind being attacked it's that it's creepy
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:01.160]  to have people like this attacking you it is
[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:07.720]  it is super super super mega creepy
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:10.840]  yeah here's the headline who's afraid of the big bad truth
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:17.720]  kmov tv last tuesday without any fanfare the obama administration
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:21.400]  or campaign at the time announced jennifer joce and bob mccullough
[02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:24.600]  the top prosecutors in st louis city and st louis county
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:28.760]  were joining something called obama's truth squad
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:32.120]  and then it goes on they plan to respond
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:35.480]  immediately to any misleading advertisements and statements that
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:39.640]  might violate missouri's ethics laws no judge no jury they just say so
[02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:42.920]  we want to keep this campaign focused on issues joce told me
[02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:46.760]  missourians don't want to be distracted by these
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:51.400]  divisive character attacks see the police now are political officers
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:56.440]  and the prosecutors they will decide the truth squads plan is to identify false
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:14:00.040]  attacks and respond immediately with truthful information
[02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:03.960]  joce and mccullough said truthful information like obama is a christian
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:09.640]  because the police say so with plans to cut taxes for everyone making under
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:13.240]  $250,000 a year you notice that didn't happen
[02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:16.760]  the obama campaign says prosecutors from kansas area
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:20.200]  and some rural areas also joining truth squads
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:25.400]  and jefferson county sheriff glenn boyer also expected to be part of the team
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:28.200]  whether it's directly attributed to the campaign or
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:31.320]  there's some of the soft money contributors mccullough told me so
[02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:35.720]  there's not the federal elections commission now it's it's they'll decide
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:38.920]  if they're not going to tell the truth that somebody's got to step up
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:42.760]  and say wait a minute that's not the truth this is the truth
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:47.480]  and then they went on in the newscast to talk about also arresting people
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:52.440]  and uh saying that you know rush limbaugh is going to maybe get in some
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:55.800]  trouble it's a long article it goes on and on
[02:14:55.800 --> 02:15:00.200]  so if you want to find it the headline and there's video too
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:04.280]  who's afraid of the big bad truth of course that's our headline
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:08.440]  i forget what kmov tv called it
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:11.480]  oh we're sorry the page you're looking for could not be found
[02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:14.920]  see that's why we save entire articles like that one
[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:17.880]  i remember getting a call by the webmaster going we only post blurbs why
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:20.520]  are you saying the whole thing i said they'll pull this
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:23.800]  first amendment document this type of terrorism against the public
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:27.720]  that the media uh engaged in along with them i have the it guys
[02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:31.560]  why the banner isn't working on that page i want to find out why on older pages
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:35.160]  it's dead like just print it and show it to them
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:39.720]  so there's no uh confusion about that existing that i just talked about right
[02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:42.920]  there or it'll turn into a three-day investigation to find the link that
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:46.840]  isn't there when it's right there thank you
[02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:52.120]  uh i said i'd go back to your calls but let me hit some ron paul news that we
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:54.360]  already covered in the first hour but we'll do it again for folks that want
[02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:59.080]  to hear it could ron paul still win main and even the new york times
[02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:02.360]  occasionally tells the truth and admits that uh he's getting the most
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:05.960]  delegates and that some of the precincts were shut down because of snow
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:09.240]  that they announced romney the winner with four percent of the vote
[02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:12.680]  being in and of course uh the same thing happened
[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:17.640]  out in uh nevada two percent were in and they announced him as the winner
[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:22.360]  here's the steve watson article at info wars dot com paul campaign points to
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:27.640]  anomalies in romney's main victory slams mainstream media suggest romney
[02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:31.640]  may have had a hand in cancelling key county caucuses so yes
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:36.840]  ron paul is pointing out evidence of chicane ring good job ron paul
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:40.040]  of course there's never elections rod america they've just pulled out the
[02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:43.960]  stops against ron paul so it's a conspiracy theory to not trust known
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:48.120]  liars you're just supposed to trust them c pack boss says jeb bush may be
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:51.720]  nominate broker convention since ron paul and mit romney right now
[02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:56.920]  are neck and neck for delegates that they may or they may put jeb in as the vp
[02:16:56.920 --> 02:16:59.880]  man i gotta tell you i'm sick of the bushes
[02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:03.400]  i'm sick of obama but with bushes you don't just get banker puppets you
[02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:07.080]  actually get really nasty secretive black operators
[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:10.440]  who gave you stuff like 911

[02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:16.360]  you
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:21.560]  i could not vote for another bush
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:28.120]  i could not vote for a bush and i couldn't vote for obama i i guess it
[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:31.160]  doesn't matter it's like asking somebody you want to bob for apples in this

[02:23:58.120 --> 02:24:01.160]  claim circumstances
[02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:12.360]  now what's happened is big chemical companies and others
[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:17.480]  have got all this toxic waste and they don't know where to put it so they
[02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:23.480]  haven't mixed into metal alloys they have uranium mixed in now with cement
[02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:29.320]  a du mixed in with different metal parts on forklifts and things
[02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:34.280]  and that's what they're doing and i have actually seen some blurbs
[02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:37.080]  but i i haven't done much research into it about
[02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:43.960]  all sorts of new chemical mixes that they're dumping on highways
[02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:48.200]  to quote keep the snow down but that really it's the chemical companies
[02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:51.320]  have learned to lobby and sell the city's
[02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:55.160]  cocktails of chemicals that'll eat through ice
[02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:59.000]  and it's just so they don't have to pay to store the toxic waste
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.680]  they don't have to pay to have it shipped out of the country
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:06.520]  they just dump it onto your highways it's the oldest trick in the book
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:10.920]  take a yard fertilizer you notice the type for grass it says do not put on
[02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:13.880]  gardens because it's got heavy metals in it well
[02:25:13.880 --> 02:25:17.960]  that just runs off into the water supply and humans it's not just the elite
[02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:21.080]  humans have always dumped everything in the river and let folks downstream deal
[02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:23.800]  with it it's just good old-fashioned pollution
[02:25:23.800 --> 02:25:27.560]  but specifically what are you saying is in this stuff that's eating everything
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:31.960]  well they they're saying it's calcium bicarbonate but they've got a few
[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:35.240]  different names for it and like i said it's eating the
[02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:38.840]  wiring out from the underside of the trucks
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:43.960]  and it's actually scoring little holes into the aluminum that i have a real
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:47.720]  rough time getting out and sometimes it's as high as 11 feet up
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:50.440]  on the top of uh... you know they'll have a cabinet
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:53.000]  on the back of a picker truck or something like that
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:58.520]  and uh... i asked them well if that if that's what it's doing to the metal
[02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:01.880]  and the wiring then what do you suppose it's doing
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:05.640]  in the fine mist when you're driving down the highway behind these guys to your
[02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:09.080]  lungs because you are breathing it are guys that live in the country
[02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:13.800]  or whatever and so i mean just you know by process of elimination you can deduce
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:16.920]  that more than likely if it's eating holes in metal it's probably not very
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:20.760]  good for us so you're saying this stuff so
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:25.560]  powerful that it eats holes in just a matter of hours it's not like regular
[02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:28.440]  salt where you've got to leave tons of it on metal
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:32.520]  and it takes months or even years you're saying how fast is this eating
[02:26:32.520 --> 02:26:36.440]  holes in the aluminum well let me put it this way uh... i've been doing this for
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:39.880]  about 10 years and i've got customers that i would go and
[02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:45.560]  do their stuff once a year and uh... you know i keep in regular contact with
[02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:49.080]  someone we did a month they're telling me that uh...
[02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:53.000]  it's eating holes in it so that's pretty quick and i mean you're talking about
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.800]  guys that are on the road pretty much every day
[02:26:55.800 --> 02:26:59.800]  and not only that but they're using the same product to put on the back roads
[02:26:59.800 --> 02:27:05.880]  for dust suppression so it's it's year-round
[02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:09.240]  unbelievable thank you so much i appreciate your call
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:13.640]  Tony in Idaho you're on the air go ahead good morning Alex
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:17.960]  go ahead and talk to you thank you Alex yes sir
[02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:23.240]  hello yes sir go ahead okay uh... yeah uh... i'd like to relay a story to a
[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:27.400]  couple of arrests i had uh... last time i was thrown in jail
[02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:31.960]  uh... i am a follower of christ so you understand where i'm coming from i'm
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:35.320]  a follower of christ i don't carry any of the marks of the world where they
[02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:38.360]  uh... they claim ownership of the carrier
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:42.680]  so uh... i've gone to jail so many times that i've lost count and the
[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:46.520]  the in the county where i was going to jail at they got tired of paying for all
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:49.160]  these court costs and everything in jail time
[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:52.920]  so they started looking into the law to try to figure some way to keep me in
[02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:57.960]  jail for a long time and uh... the judge the prosecutor
[02:27:57.960 --> 02:28:03.560]  and uh... and uh... sheriff all ordered the deputies to leave me alone
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:07.560]  and the reason i know this is because the very next day the deputy stopped me
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:10.680]  and he held me for something like thirty minutes
[02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:14.120]  uh... threatening me saying he's going to take everything i have
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:17.960]  he said that they've ordered me not to do this but as soon as they give me
[02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:21.800]  find out i can take you under law i'm gonna come after you and i'm gonna take
[02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:25.000]  everything you got throw you in jail no sir you've hit the key to everything
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:28.680]  here why do you think police admit even in the news
[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:32.280]  they're ordered to release illegal aliens because the globalist want them
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:36.280]  here to drive down wages and to balkanize the country
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:39.720]  i'm not even blaming the folks willing to be here the
[02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:42.520]  you know they're fleeing tyranny into another tyranny but one that isn't as
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:46.920]  bad yet but that's why the illegals are above
[02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:49.640]  the law is because they just keep coming back
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:53.480]  and they just ignore all these fraudulent globalist laws
[02:28:53.480 --> 02:28:57.560]  okay now the globalist call you a sovereign citizen they say you're the
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:01.480]  number one enemy because when they bring in their cash with society
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:04.200]  everybody's going to start imitating what you've done
[02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:07.800]  and if you don't follow what they're doing they won't be able to get their new
[02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:11.320]  world order and so agenda twenty one all of it
[02:29:11.320 --> 02:29:15.480]  is designed to bankrupt you and make you go into their compact cities
[02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:18.680]  to live in their government housing where you're forced to take the shots and
[02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:22.920]  all the rest of it and so people like you who are completely
[02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:27.000]  dropping out of this corrupt system uh you're the people they hate and
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:30.120]  because they can't suck any money out of you
[02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:36.040]  they're now leaving you alone uh and but i wouldn't i wouldn't i'd try to be
[02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:38.280]  friendly to him and explain why you're doing what you're doing
[02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:42.040]  you know i got ed asner coming up but after he leaves us if you want to stay
[02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:46.120]  on hold i'll go into some overdrive i want to talk to you some more because
[02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:54.200]  uh this is a phenomenon everywhere we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:54.200 --> 02:30:01.080]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:05.400]  a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research into why
[02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:09.080]  even if i had a pretty good size meal that i was still starving and my research
[02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:13.480]  led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:16.280]  here in the united states and across the industrialized world
[02:30:16.280 --> 02:30:19.960]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[02:30:19.960 --> 02:30:24.520]  minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight
[02:30:24.520 --> 02:30:28.840]  off cancer and be healthy i then searched out the best vitamin

[02:32:02.760 --> 02:32:06.600]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[02:32:06.600 --> 02:32:09.480]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:32:09.480 --> 02:32:13.720]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[02:32:13.720 --> 02:32:17.320]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:32:17.320 --> 02:32:20.760]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:24.520]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:32:24.520 --> 02:32:27.480]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:32:27.480 --> 02:32:31.320]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:32:31.320 --> 02:32:34.680]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[02:32:34.680 --> 02:32:38.440]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:32:38.440 --> 02:32:41.240]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:32:41.240 --> 02:32:44.360]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:47.080]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more

[02:33:27.400 --> 02:33:31.640]  throughout the ages architects and engineers have designed and built the
[02:33:31.640 --> 02:33:35.160]  great structures that have made our world and
[02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:39.480]  withstood the test of time hi i'm ed asher
[02:33:39.480 --> 02:33:45.640]  welcome to architects and engineers
[02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:52.120]  let's look now at modern steel frame buildings
[02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:57.400]  this is the empire state building a marvel of modern architecture
[02:33:57.400 --> 02:34:01.560]  it was built to last
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:09.080]  architects and engineers of today use computers to design an engineer
[02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:12.920]  buildings that will endure the forces of nature
[02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:18.600]  such as earthquakes fires and hurricanes
[02:34:18.600 --> 02:34:30.360]  this modern skyscraper was also built to last
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:34.680]  we've seen buildings completely destroyed like this before
[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:41.880]  but only when done intentionally danie joenco is the expert on this in europe
[02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:45.560]  what did he say this is controlled emulation
[02:34:45.560 --> 02:34:57.640]  let's compare
[02:34:57.640 --> 02:35:03.240]  all right that's a five-minute video that you can obviously watch at architects
[02:35:03.240 --> 02:35:07.400]  and engineers for 911 truth that's been seen millions of times
[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:11.640]  online and now a pbs channels i know around the country
[02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:16.840]  have also been airing it our guest really needs no introduction he has a lot
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:20.760]  of courage whether you agree with his politics
[02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:24.920]  completely or not undoubtedly he's an honorable person who stands up for what
[02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:30.280]  he believes is right ed asher and he's volunteering his time again
[02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:34.280]  for a new film they're working on uh shooting soon with a
[02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:39.160]  laundry list of other famous actors i can't see any as famous as ed asher but
[02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:42.760]  some of them close a violation of trust that basically
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:46.840]  puts the whole thing on trial and that is a very very
[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:53.800]  exciting 911 new investigation dot com has information on that as well
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:59.320]  a 911 truth has information on it bottom line i've talked to the
[02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:03.720]  emergency manager deputy head new york he said there were bombs in the
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:07.240]  buildings he was told that he was there building seven he died
[02:36:07.240 --> 02:36:10.200]  right after the interview danie joenco one of the top
[02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:14.120]  controlled emolition experts in europe went public uh they ran him over in a
[02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:17.560]  suspicious automobile accident they've killed a lot of people they're really
[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:22.280]  scared of experts and ed obviously he's putting his
[02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:26.520]  life on the line so am i i've talked to police officers by name on this show
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:31.160]  who were there and heard the countdown the blow-up building seven
[02:36:31.160 --> 02:36:34.680]  and then the disinfo people spin that and say you're just attacking the police
[02:36:34.680 --> 02:36:38.120]  officers like they were involved no the firefighters and police were told get back
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:42.120]  they're bringing it down they didn't say who they were
[02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:47.160]  and you see now with democracy now but before then she was just gone in new
[02:36:47.160 --> 02:36:52.280]  york uh amy goodman getting the countdown and and and running and then
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:56.360]  you see building seven blow up and i've talked to one police officer who's in
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:37:00.040]  that video who was there and they said get get out of here there's a countdown
[02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:03.400]  it's going to come down we have police on video saying on cnn get back they're
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:07.080]  bringing seven down so seven is the key and ed asner has
[02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:11.560]  volunteered his time to expose it i wanted to spend some time on 911 with him
[02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:15.240]  and then get into some other issues but ed great to have you here with us sir
[02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:19.480]  good to be with you alec keep doing the great work you're doing
[02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:25.240]  so much is happening just out of the gates your view on 9 11 why you question it
[02:37:25.240 --> 02:37:28.840]  and give us a little tidbits on this film that's in development
[02:37:28.840 --> 02:37:34.600]  well it's it's a color an imaginary film of a commission
[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:38.600]  assembled by the government to uh finally and fully
[02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:44.760]  hear and examine uh what happened on 9 11 with particular
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:58.760]  answers is on building seven and uh there was uh if the one follows the script uh
[02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:05.640]  definitely uh governmental activity in uh in the
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:13.560]  actions that took place that day i i made also a 10 minute film with
[02:38:13.560 --> 02:38:16.840]  mark ridell
[02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:30.040]  names uh flee from me uh like uh like my years uh i understand i've actually
[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:33.240]  got list of all the films you've made about 9 11 and i can't even find them
[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:35.960]  here in my list the point is you've done a lot of great work
[02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:40.040]  exposing this but but just watching building seven to come down
[02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:44.840]  i mean it's so ridiculous the blast points the freefall all of it
[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:48.360]  and they're scared to death of any investigation you know rumsfeld
[02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:52.840]  was asked by eric muller a talk show host about the control demolition of it
[02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:55.960]  and rumsfeld said i don't even know that exist
[02:38:55.960 --> 02:38:59.080]  and basically implied the building didn't even exist and we were crazy to
[02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:05.160]  even ask uh well rumsfeld has has robbed him out
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:12.120]  before and why should he stop now uh he was one of the chiefs that day
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:17.880]  uh i have the 10 minute film i made with with mark ridell
[02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:25.880]  brian was our director and writer and in which i introduced the idea
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:30.200]  that building seven came down with assisted help
[02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:37.080]  it was uh not damaged by either the planes the owner himself said uh
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:41.080]  is quoted as having said we're going to have to pull it
[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:46.280]  uh and so my argument in the film is uh is based on the fact that
[02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:51.320]  well to to pull up building in other words destroy it
[02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:55.880]  here after they have explosives brought in and placed judiciously throughout the
[02:39:55.880 --> 02:40:01.080]  building to bring it down uh and i heard of the argument if
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:05.400]  they could do that with that building why couldn't they do it with the twin
[02:40:05.400 --> 02:40:09.800]  towers which i feel they did they assisted them
[02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:14.440]  brought them down uh there are great arguments by the
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:18.680]  architect engineers that the planes themselves could not have
[02:40:18.680 --> 02:40:23.560]  done that to those buildings so if the planes couldn't have done it
[02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:30.680]  if you accept that premise then it had to have been pre-funded explosives
[02:40:31.320 --> 02:40:34.920]  well you're right about that but expanding on it
[02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:38.920]  now even the la times admits that al-qaeda real al-qaeda
[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:42.920]  has been given control of libya they're being used to invade syria
[02:40:42.920 --> 02:40:47.560]  they're being used to launch terror attacks inside iran even nbc had the
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:51.880]  headline friday israel uses terror group to attack
[02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:56.280]  iran and then they admit it's a well hobbyist group out of saudi arabia
[02:40:56.280 --> 02:40:59.640]  i've interviewed the head of the u.s. embassy mr springman who said they
[02:40:59.640 --> 02:41:02.760]  wouldn't let mohammed adda and others into the u.s.
[02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:06.920]  in 2000 because they were flagged as terrorist and then they got a call from
[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:11.240]  the state department saying they work for the cia that's their cover
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:15.160]  let them in and i mean this isn't theories i've interviewed the people
[02:41:15.160 --> 02:41:19.160]  who witnessed this civil edmunds as you know fbi translator
[02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:24.440]  heard al-qaeda being commanded on the day of 9 11 by the pentagon
[02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:32.280]  well i mean the fabric is so rotten i suppose people
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:36.520]  uh i i didn't hear about the uh the european expert
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:39.480]  being run over was he killed yes he was killed
[02:41:39.480 --> 02:41:44.440]  oh that's interesting uh well i i guess i have to
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:50.920]  tumble in my boot i don't think that's going to happen yeah well it's cold
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:54.760]  here now so i'll tumble anyway
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:59.640]  oh man i tell you it is um it is so sad how crazy things have gotten but the
[02:41:59.640 --> 02:42:02.360]  good news is people are starting to wake up
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:06.440]  what do you make it of just the craziness of the world today
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:11.240]  and and and open discussions of huge wars being launched
[02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:15.960]  well it looks like iran is being set up for some kind of action
[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:25.480]  with the so-used uh being blocked by our uh navy uh and i i imagine that uh
[02:42:25.480 --> 02:42:30.840]  there will be some action this summer or or fall
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:37.480]  uh uh to uh either create another october surprise
[02:42:37.480 --> 02:42:42.840]  or uh or to say well it's israel well we can't do anything about that
[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:48.360]  uh well we we can of course if uh if our congress uh
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:53.880]  didn't keep supplying them with uh all the money in the world that they need
[02:42:53.880 --> 02:42:57.560]  well my issue is this i don't want anything to happen to israel i'm not
[02:42:57.560 --> 02:43:02.840]  an enemy of israel uh but my issue is i ran if they develop
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:05.160]  a nuclear weapon which they're not even you know
[02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:09.640]  close to do according to the cia israel's got hundreds of nukes
[02:43:09.640 --> 02:43:13.880]  and uh the iranians have been taking all these terror attacks in their country
[02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:17.480]  without responding back and their scientists being killed
[02:43:17.480 --> 02:43:22.040]  i mean who says that that iran would ever attack israel
[02:43:22.040 --> 02:43:26.120]  with a single nuke i mean pakistan has a hundred nukes
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:29.080]  and our government's bombing their country and even though they're saying
[02:43:29.080 --> 02:43:34.200]  stop it and i i've had people like colonel shaffer on it he
[02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:38.680]  agrees with me the number one threat is starting a war with pakistan now
[02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:42.520]  well i have i have uh been in touch with
[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:48.760]  certain fields who uh who feel that inaction is forthcoming and uh
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:54.840]  they're they're trying to alert and uh get get people to pay attention to uh
[02:43:54.840 --> 02:44:00.840]  to make some uh some motion of uh of stopping it before it gets too
[02:44:00.840 --> 02:44:07.000]  started and the american press uh starts brainwashing us that uh
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:12.200]  creating a false flag operation uh we have to watch and see what kind of
[02:44:12.200 --> 02:44:16.360]  false flag is going to be developed on this issue
[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:22.360]  boy you said it and uh they are calling for false flags i've seen the cfr
[02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:26.040]  publicly say a provocation would would be great
[02:44:26.040 --> 02:44:30.040]  yeah and i've seen the brookings institute and clapper the head of national
[02:44:30.040 --> 02:44:33.960]  security openly talk about how great an attack would be
[02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:38.280]  because then they'd have an excuse to attack
[02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:42.360]  very transparent well i i i don't know where it's going to
[02:44:42.360 --> 02:44:47.240]  and i my mind is is boggle that the complicity that goes on throughout this
[02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:51.960]  world and uh uh i have no
[02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:56.520]  answers i i would merely like to expose the truth
[02:44:56.520 --> 02:45:01.560]  or continue trying to help the exposure of truth
[02:45:01.560 --> 02:45:06.680]  uh for what was done in the past if we can solve the past then maybe we can
[02:45:06.680 --> 02:45:13.080]  militate against future such uh horrendous complicity in the
[02:45:13.080 --> 02:45:17.800]  future well you're right again if we can't turn
[02:45:17.800 --> 02:45:22.520]  around the and expose the old crimes then the corrupt system is going to get
[02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:25.880]  away with greater and greater and greater of course
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:32.760]  and and uh the american people have to stop saying who are we
[02:45:32.760 --> 02:45:40.200]  what do we stand for what are we doing and uh you know ron paul for whatever
[02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:44.280]  other faults he may have certainly says let's let's stop our foreign
[02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:48.200]  engagements and if we if we only could put a
[02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:51.640]  break on these foreign engagements it would be a lot more
[02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:56.280]  difficult to to initiate the false flag operations that always
[02:45:56.280 --> 02:46:00.520]  precede these holocausts that we have engaged in
[02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:05.240]  such as iraq even afghanistan
[02:46:06.200 --> 02:46:09.960]  well the good news is ed and i want your perspective on this it does seem that
[02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:13.800]  more people are becoming aware congress has the lowest approval
[02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:18.200]  rating ever uh people don't like uh mit romney and they
[02:46:18.200 --> 02:46:22.840]  don't like barack obama despite the media trying to demonize ron paul and
[02:46:22.840 --> 02:46:27.880]  make stuff up uh he's had a better showing than ever and i see that as a
[02:46:27.880 --> 02:46:32.520]  real indicator uh that across the board people are starting to wake up
[02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:36.920]  well but you you you need a point man i don't
[02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:40.280]  i'm afraid we don't have one
[02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:46.920]  you need a point man and uh ron ron paul will be discredited by the big
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:51.640]  money operators uh and all we can do is call him a
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:54.680]  voice in the wilderness
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:47:00.440]  as things come to a head i want to go back to the seal situation so you know
[02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:04.520]  currently serving navy seals obviously you're there in california and a
[02:47:04.520 --> 02:47:07.960]  famous guy and you're saying that they're reaching out to you
[02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:10.920]  saying please warn everyone it's about to happen
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:14.200]  that's what i'm being told by my military sources sir yeah
[02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:19.400]  uh the same thing here the same thing here and uh
[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:23.080]  they're they're trying to enlist as many people as they can
[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:29.560]  uh but uh they're uh they're not in power right now
[02:47:29.560 --> 02:47:34.840]  and uh they they they don't have sufficient power to generate
[02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:38.360]  a uh a single pointing that will take effect
[02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:42.280]  why are the seals not wanting to go to war i mean i know that's a silly question
[02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:47.240]  but what have they told you they said that uh more
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:51.720]  more or less the false flag is coming and that uh
[02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:55.560]  we're going to be involved in more foreign escapades
[02:47:55.560 --> 02:47:59.320]  and uh you know one of these triggers on
[02:47:59.320 --> 02:48:07.080]  on uh uh false flag operations runs the danger of
[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:13.640]  worldwide conflict if it gets out of hand and uh i think that's what they're
[02:48:13.640 --> 02:48:16.600]  afraid of incredible you're saying navy seals and ed
[02:48:16.600 --> 02:48:20.520]  asner former head of the screen actors guild and hundreds of films tv shows
[02:48:20.520 --> 02:48:23.560]  one of the most famous living actors out there an icon
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:27.160]  who who doesn't make stuff up is saying he's talking to
[02:48:27.160 --> 02:48:32.840]  navy seals who say not only is the war coming but that a false flag or stage
[02:48:32.840 --> 02:48:35.560]  terror attack as a provocation is coming
[02:48:35.560 --> 02:48:41.240]  and uh they're saying they have intel on this this is incredible news ed
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:47.000]  well i i i can't default and i can't go further than what i said
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:52.120]  they've they've alerted me and uh i've tried to help in whatever way i can but
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:56.520]  uh there's only so much i can do and only so much i will stick my neck out
[02:48:56.520 --> 02:49:00.920]  no i understand but now remember cheney sci-hersh exposed this
[02:49:00.920 --> 02:49:04.360]  and ray mcgovern former cia analyst told us at the time but
[02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:08.360]  he couldn't get into sources but sci-hersh reported as you know after
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:12.360]  cheney left office three years ago that two years before that five years ago
[02:49:12.360 --> 02:49:16.120]  cheney ordered the seals to paint up blue boats
[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:21.800]  like navy like the iranian navy boats and a stage and attack on a destroyer
[02:49:21.800 --> 02:49:25.080]  and we know that admiral fowlin at the time said no that's why he later
[02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:27.480]  resigned but we've already come that close
[02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:30.120]  before so i guess that's probably why the seals
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:33.000]  know about stuff like this they say anything about that
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:38.040]  no they did not uh but i'm i'm sure they know about it
[02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:42.760]  uh if i were to question them further and i and i haven't
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:47.880]  wow anything else you can tell us about the seals reaching out to you
[02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:52.360]  well i would uh uh
[02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:57.240]  off air giving the gentleman i talked to
[02:49:57.240 --> 02:50:00.920]  oh wow i don't okay well the show ends here in a few minutes and we'll
[02:50:00.920 --> 02:50:05.080]  we'll talk off air uh ed just amazing or
[02:50:05.080 --> 02:50:08.760]  perhaps i should get you back on too i know that you were going to be on and
[02:50:08.760 --> 02:50:12.440]  got tied up and uh we could talk forever about these subjects
[02:50:12.440 --> 02:50:15.880]  doesn't it feel like you lived through world war two i wasn't around then
[02:50:15.880 --> 02:50:19.480]  but doesn't it feel like that that calm before the storm
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:23.800]  as all these armies are lining up and they're putting the fleet out there
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:28.040]  menacing china and the chinese president saying prepare for war with the
[02:50:28.040 --> 02:50:32.280]  u.s i went back and looked at history i've never seen times
[02:50:32.280 --> 02:50:35.960]  that a chinese president was saying prepare for war with the u.s
[02:50:35.960 --> 02:50:39.720]  the russians are saying don't go into syria and and threatening back and putting
[02:50:39.720 --> 02:50:45.160]  troops in i mean this is crazy well yesterday's was it
[02:50:45.160 --> 02:50:48.600]  yesterday's new york times or was it today
[02:50:48.600 --> 02:50:55.560]  uh your lead article on the right of the uh commander of the seals calling for
[02:50:55.560 --> 02:50:59.960]  uh greater widespread operations by the seals
[02:50:59.960 --> 02:51:04.360]  throughout the world uh greater budgeting
[02:51:04.360 --> 02:51:08.760]  greater activity by the seals and doing covert operations
[02:51:08.760 --> 02:51:14.120]  and this is all part of it uh creating instead of drones they would use seals to
[02:51:14.120 --> 02:51:19.080]  create the uh the uh
[02:51:19.080 --> 02:51:24.440]  demolition of individuals such as the auto accident that took care of your uh
[02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:28.200]  the police engineer or whatever he was uh
[02:51:28.200 --> 02:51:32.680]  who comment on our 9 11 uh yeah danie joenco yeah
[02:51:32.680 --> 02:51:36.520]  yeah by the way they say it was very suspicious how he died
[02:51:36.520 --> 02:51:39.400]  uh i i actually pulled it back up it was a few months ago
[02:51:39.400 --> 02:51:43.000]  just out of nowhere his car was actually taken control of
[02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:46.520]  and veered off into a tree but the dog was okay and then there was a
[02:51:46.520 --> 02:51:50.600]  bunch of suspicious stuff around it just like with princess diana
[02:51:50.600 --> 02:51:54.440]  and her killing but but what's incredible about this she even wrote a
[02:51:54.440 --> 02:51:57.960]  letter saying uh if i'm killed charles says he's
[02:51:57.960 --> 02:52:01.560]  going to kill me in a fake auto accident she's killed that way
[02:52:01.560 --> 02:52:05.320]  the whole thing suspicious but the mainstream media calls it a conspiracy
[02:52:05.320 --> 02:52:09.720]  theory ed yeah well they dismissed all of us that way
[02:52:09.720 --> 02:52:12.840]  i i can't tell you how many times i've talked to
[02:52:12.840 --> 02:52:18.200]  wonderful intelligent uh certainly not right wing reactionaries
[02:52:18.200 --> 02:52:22.520]  and uh and brought up the subject 9 11
[02:52:22.520 --> 02:52:27.480]  and they looked at me talk a lot they remind me of the plastic dogs in the
[02:52:27.480 --> 02:52:33.400]  in the uh back of the cars that they are sitting there
[02:52:33.400 --> 02:52:37.400]  bobbing their heads and looking at me with amazement
[02:52:37.400 --> 02:52:45.480]  little plastic dogs and uh uh they think i'm out of my goddamn mind
[02:52:45.480 --> 02:52:51.240]  but uh i realized that they the american people for the most
[02:52:51.240 --> 02:52:55.880]  one no matter how intelligent they are don't want to have the myth of santa
[02:52:55.880 --> 02:53:01.400]  claus america destroyed by hearing such stories they
[02:53:01.400 --> 02:53:05.080]  either don't want to miss destroyed or they shake
[02:53:05.080 --> 02:53:10.520]  in fear that they don't want to be complicit in harboring such thoughts
[02:53:10.520 --> 02:53:13.640]  well that was my next question it's funny you bring that up
[02:53:13.640 --> 02:53:16.520]  i've studied other empires history corruption
[02:53:16.520 --> 02:53:20.280]  and the corruptors know that once they get things to a certain point once they
[02:53:20.280 --> 02:53:24.120]  sell a big enough lie and people buy into it
[02:53:24.120 --> 02:53:27.720]  they will defend the corrupt system in fears of bringing it down
[02:53:27.720 --> 02:53:30.680]  but at a certain point you've got to bring it all down
[02:53:30.680 --> 02:53:34.120]  because the system itself is threatening to destroy
[02:53:34.120 --> 02:53:45.960]  all life on this planet exactly uh but how how do you how do you
[02:53:45.960 --> 02:53:53.320]  achieve unity in people in demanding redress
[02:53:53.320 --> 02:53:59.880]  through these crimes in our name in our name supposedly
[02:53:59.880 --> 02:54:04.920]  to uh to maintain our wonderful comfortable way of living
[02:54:04.920 --> 02:54:08.840]  that's the that's the final reason the final excuse
[02:54:08.840 --> 02:54:13.160]  the raison d'etre you don't question authority
[02:54:13.160 --> 02:54:17.400]  well if we don't start questioning authority as you do
[02:54:17.400 --> 02:54:23.000]  as i do in my little way we don't start questioning then authority will
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:27.560]  finally have us sealed up in such a bottle we couldn't get out of
[02:54:27.560 --> 02:54:33.000]  if we scream bloody murder you're right at asger we've only got four or five
[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.720]  minutes left we're going to end the official broadcast and i'll let's say
[02:54:35.720 --> 02:54:38.600]  bye to you and get that contact if it's okay with you
[02:54:38.600 --> 02:54:42.440]  sure after that seal because we do need to do everything we can
[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:46.840]  right now to try to turn this around and i think we can do it i mean we stopped
[02:54:46.840 --> 02:54:49.960]  cheney the last time he wanted to do that he tried to start a war with the
[02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:54.360]  russians back in 08 uh we've got to try as hard as we
[02:54:54.360 --> 02:54:58.120]  can because when you've got all the top brass and even the head of the massade
[02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:02.760]  being fired a year ago for saying to netanyahu don't attack iran it's
[02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:07.400]  going to be a catastrophe uh these politicians have just
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:11.400]  become so divorced from reality you know looking at history ed and of course
[02:55:11.400 --> 02:55:14.440]  you know better than i before it was politicians worried about
[02:55:14.440 --> 02:55:18.520]  generals trying to start wars because they wanted to fight wars and be heroes
[02:55:18.520 --> 02:55:23.080]  but now it's generals stopping the crazy politicians from wars
[02:55:23.080 --> 02:55:26.680]  who have no idea what they're about to get us into i mean that's what's scary ed
[02:55:26.680 --> 02:55:31.240]  is that the generals and military across the board are saying do not start
[02:55:31.240 --> 02:55:34.920]  this russia and china are going to get involved
[02:55:34.920 --> 02:55:42.600]  well a typical example would be hitler hitler who uh insisted
[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:47.880]  that his moves against the various states of europe
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:54.520]  were always questioned and and and uh and and tried to be soft peddled
[02:55:54.520 --> 02:56:02.520]  slowed by his generals but his orders ran uh ran amok
[02:56:02.520 --> 02:56:10.040]  and uh world war two was launched by his uh by his hoopris
[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:14.040]  and the generals had to follow and the same thing is occurring here
[02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:19.880]  people who who aren't generals are uh and and when the generals complain
[02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:24.280]  they get replaced they did this in iraq a couple of times if you'll recall
[02:56:24.280 --> 02:56:29.320]  shinseki was one i think and uh a bunch of them and the uh
[02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:33.000]  latin america was another uh they got rid of
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:37.080]  fallon mullen the last two joint chiefs of staff yeah
[02:56:37.080 --> 02:56:42.440]  have said don't do this yeah so we're we're in the same pickle
[02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:49.000]  and uh unless unless somebody somehow scares the crap out of
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:54.360]  congress uh uh to get them to change their march
[02:56:54.360 --> 02:56:58.680]  to oblivion that's what we're faced with here
[02:56:58.680 --> 02:57:03.000]  your your your seal contact what i've been told is it's an october surprise but
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:07.640]  it could happen in june july august september yeah
[02:57:07.640 --> 02:57:14.440]  and of course we won't be directly involved uh they they uh they keep uh
[02:57:14.440 --> 02:57:20.920]  the israelis keep uh keep appearing as the as the uh the 600 pound gorilla
[02:57:20.920 --> 02:57:25.480]  and uh and i don't know how you're going to control them
[02:57:25.480 --> 02:57:29.160]  well for my military contacts and what's now been admitted that that's all part
[02:57:29.160 --> 02:57:32.040]  of a staged event to act like the u.s is reluctant
[02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:35.960]  but the people running the u.s are going to have israel is basically the
[02:57:35.960 --> 02:57:39.480]  fire starter and then the united states and nato are going to come in with both
[02:57:39.480 --> 02:57:44.760]  feet yeah nato yeah another another arm of the
[02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:48.600]  united states i tell you ed asner it is just
[02:57:48.600 --> 02:57:51.400]  incredible and you're right we've got exposed 911 because
[02:57:51.400 --> 02:57:55.960]  it's the lie that all of this is based on including tsa

[03:00:05.240 --> 03:00:11.240]  music
[03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:19.240]  in constant sorrow
[03:00:21.640 --> 03:00:29.240]  i am the man of constant sorrow
[03:00:29.240 --> 03:00:37.240]  i've seen trouble all right we're in overdrive
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:51.080]  we're in overdrive and i am here taking a few final calls
[03:00:51.080 --> 03:00:54.280]  um i want to finish with tony and idaho was telling the story and they get to
[03:00:54.280 --> 03:00:58.200]  matt in australia and i won't be able to get to gary and michelle i
[03:00:58.200 --> 03:01:04.840]  apologize but uh tony in um idaho so they've arrested you many many times
[03:01:04.840 --> 03:01:07.880]  finally they couldn't squeeze any money out of you they tried to find a way to
[03:01:07.880 --> 03:01:11.160]  lock you up permanently to teach you a lesson but the constitution wouldn't
[03:01:11.160 --> 03:01:13.800]  let them do that there'll be a fema camp later don't worry
[03:01:13.800 --> 03:01:17.000]  but because you're out of their system which a lot of folks have been forced
[03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.960]  out of it because you just can't live in it a lot of people can't it's designed
[03:01:19.960 --> 03:01:23.800]  to be unsustainable uh so they can force you into their system
[03:01:23.800 --> 03:01:27.960]  um that they now are just leaving you alone i mean you know the police
[03:01:27.960 --> 03:01:31.880]  you're told to leave illegal aliens alone can't you leave
[03:01:31.880 --> 03:01:35.320]  sovereign citizens mainly folks that have lost everything they had or
[03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:38.280]  or disabled because i know a lot of these folks here in austin
[03:01:38.280 --> 03:01:40.920]  can't you just let them sleep with their little minivan
[03:01:40.920 --> 03:01:44.520]  can't you just let them have their little can of spam and their crackers and
[03:01:44.520 --> 03:01:49.400]  go do odd jobs at people's houses no you got to arrest them every week and beat
[03:01:49.400 --> 03:01:53.560]  them up because they're the americans that aren't paying money to the foreign
[03:01:53.560 --> 03:01:56.200]  bankers they're the americans that aren't going to go along
[03:01:56.200 --> 03:01:59.400]  with the cashless society and it's the same they're attacking these type of
[03:01:59.400 --> 03:02:02.520]  guys all over the world let me guess your profile
[03:02:02.520 --> 03:02:06.120]  choni did i accurately guess it or are you a handyman
[03:02:06.120 --> 03:02:09.880]  pretty much yes there you go i just know hundreds of this guy
[03:02:09.880 --> 03:02:13.480]  okay and so they attack you like you're the living plague because the feds have
[03:02:13.480 --> 03:02:17.320]  taught them so go ahead yeah well i was going to say the last
[03:02:17.320 --> 03:02:21.480]  time the last cop that stopped me was a month after they had already told me
[03:02:21.480 --> 03:02:23.880]  that the sheriff had ordered him to leave me alone
[03:02:23.880 --> 03:02:28.840]  and i was kind of worried because this guy followed me for a long ways past a
[03:02:28.840 --> 03:02:32.200]  bunch of houses and he stopped me out in the middle of nowhere on out on a dirt
[03:02:32.200 --> 03:02:34.120]  road yeah well because they tell them these are
[03:02:34.120 --> 03:02:37.560]  cop killers that you want to deal with them go ahead and arrest him he reads
[03:02:37.560 --> 03:02:41.800]  adl comic books all day believing it and so he was ready for you probably out
[03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:45.160]  there on that lonely stretch by the way i didn't ask you if you were a handyman
[03:02:45.160 --> 03:02:49.400]  did i off air uh no no no i mean i'm people to know i
[03:02:49.400 --> 03:02:52.600]  know what i'm talking about you are people i don't want to get into your
[03:02:52.600 --> 03:02:55.160]  whole story but i imagine it's been pretty rough
[03:02:55.160 --> 03:02:58.440]  and now you're out there just trying to get food to eat
[03:02:58.440 --> 03:03:02.120]  yeah uh i'd like to tell you about that last stop but
[03:03:02.120 --> 03:03:07.640]  this guy uh this is a cop that had taken an oath to uphold the constitution
[03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:10.920]  he was accusing me of being a constitutionalist as if
[03:03:10.920 --> 03:03:15.800]  i was the lawbreaker by being a constitutionalist in his mind
[03:03:15.800 --> 03:03:19.480]  no i know see i knew that was coming next no it's all adl
[03:03:19.480 --> 03:03:23.160]  which is a foreign government and southern poverty law center
[03:03:23.160 --> 03:03:28.200]  and and and and these obama globalist uh that say we're the enemy listen they
[03:03:28.200 --> 03:03:31.880]  tell cops you're a terrorist if you talk about agenda 21 it's all
[03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:34.920]  real it's all happening everything we talked about
[03:03:34.920 --> 03:03:39.240]  it's happening but they these cops are brainwashed listen i have video of
[03:03:39.240 --> 03:03:42.920]  police finding a copy of a constitution a car
[03:03:42.920 --> 03:03:47.400]  and they begin to hyperventilate and you think it's a money python joke
[03:03:47.400 --> 03:03:52.840]  it's not yeah i one of the reasons that the
[03:03:52.840 --> 03:03:56.840]  sheriff had ordered them to leave me alone is because there is a maximum of
[03:03:56.840 --> 03:04:00.600]  law written in man's law in american law that states
[03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:03.880]  the source of the right determines governing law
[03:04:03.880 --> 03:04:07.240]  i am a follower of christ i haven't submitted myself that's right that's
[03:04:07.240 --> 03:04:10.120]  why the amish don't have to have all the ideas and stuff because under common
[03:04:10.120 --> 03:04:13.000]  law it's recognized they are apart from the system
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:16.760]  and this country was founded by the pilgrims trying to do the same thing
[03:04:16.760 --> 03:04:20.600]  the basis of america is about leave me alone
[03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:24.840]  the basis of america is i can come out of your system
[03:04:24.840 --> 03:04:31.000]  yeah absolutely i know my ancestors hopped on a ship a leaky ship and came
[03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.880]  across the ocean trying to get away from all that stuff but
[03:04:33.880 --> 03:04:37.000]  i mean it's right back here they're like well you got to follow some law
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:41.960]  yeah if it's not a totally lawless neural order law it's not constitutional
[03:04:41.960 --> 03:04:46.440]  and our constitution is based on god's law it points out our law comes from god
[03:04:46.440 --> 03:04:49.000]  and you're going to follow it i'm going into more overdrive
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:52.360]  i'm going to come back with matt in australia tony and others tony god bless
[03:04:52.360 --> 03:04:55.640]  you i appreciate your call now i have time to take those other calls call back
[03:04:55.640 --> 03:05:00.120]  in 800-25 at 99231 those callers i said i couldn't go
[03:05:00.120 --> 03:05:03.080]  to i'll come back to you a little over a year ago
[03:05:03.080 --> 03:05:07.480]  i began to do a lot of research into why even if i had a pretty good sized meal
[03:05:07.480 --> 03:05:11.160]  that i was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[03:05:11.160 --> 03:05:14.920]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and
[03:05:14.920 --> 03:05:18.440]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted
[03:05:18.440 --> 03:05:21.880]  of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[03:05:21.880 --> 03:05:26.280]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy
[03:05:26.280 --> 03:05:30.680]  i then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there

[03:19:04.040 --> 03:19:06.920]  hydroponic centers online i can grab all that stuff
[03:19:06.920 --> 03:19:09.880]  but not because you're growing it for cannabis we have you know there's a
[03:19:09.880 --> 03:19:12.360]  lot of money gets invested in the stuff you know
[03:19:12.360 --> 03:19:17.800]  and and it's got me thinking alex you know like i thought to myself well okay
[03:19:17.800 --> 03:19:21.400]  well i'm looking to that we do have a hemp party here in australia
[03:19:21.400 --> 03:19:25.720]  but it's been going for a few years now there's only 13 members that are part of
[03:19:25.720 --> 03:19:28.760]  this and i know and it gets me thinking it's it's
[03:19:28.760 --> 03:19:32.440]  the platform that california is using and i think it was the
[03:19:32.440 --> 03:19:37.240]  we grow uh they were supplying all the nutrients and all the growing systems
[03:19:37.240 --> 03:19:42.040]  and that and and and let's let's turn this around uh
[03:19:42.040 --> 03:19:46.120]  because of the bottom line they hate marijuana because it's grassroots
[03:19:46.120 --> 03:19:51.640]  they want hardcore drugs they ship in both pharmaceutical and illegal so don't
[03:19:51.640 --> 03:19:54.440]  use any pharmaceuticals or any hard drugs
[03:19:54.440 --> 03:19:57.880]  marijuana has got some good uses but can also cause problems
[03:19:57.880 --> 03:20:27.720]  all right folks we'll be right back stay with us
