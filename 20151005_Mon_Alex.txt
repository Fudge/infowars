[00:00.000 --> 00:14.580]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.580 --> 00:41.360]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen thank you
[00:41.360 --> 00:48.960]  so much for joining us on this live worldwide Monday transmission the fifth day of October 2015
[00:48.960 --> 00:56.920]  Congressman Daniel Webster who helped lead the operation to have Boehner announced that he was
[00:56.920 --> 01:02.480]  stepping down two weeks ago we'll be joining us he's part of the leadership fight for ascension to
[01:02.480 --> 01:07.160]  the speakership of the house which is basically as important as the presidency to the United States
[01:07.160 --> 01:13.040]  and a certain line of the presidency if we get a patriot paleo-conservative constitutionalist
[01:13.040 --> 01:21.520]  libertarian veined individual into that position it is a mega massive game changer five billion
[01:21.520 --> 01:26.960]  dollars it's estimated was spent on the last presidential campaign domestically alone billions
[01:26.960 --> 01:32.920]  of dollars foreign was spent as well so let's say seven million dollars there is literally almost
[01:32.920 --> 01:38.120]  no money not even a million when I looked into it last night that has been spent by different packs
[01:38.120 --> 01:43.520]  and groups to try to get somebody into replace Boehner we're removing Boehner but he's going
[01:43.520 --> 01:48.440]  before he becomes even more unpopular in his own admission to put in one of his little minions
[01:48.440 --> 01:59.120]  so Congressman Daniel Webster will be joining us also in the fourth hour Paul Joseph Watson will
[01:59.120 --> 02:05.680]  be hosting I asked him this morning what he was going to be covering and turns out he's
[02:05.680 --> 02:08.800]  been covering one of the things I'm going to be covering today when he does the fourth hour
[02:08.800 --> 02:16.640]  pouring drain cleaner in your eyes the next trendy social justice movement this is on
[02:16.640 --> 02:24.560]  mainstream television with a basic endorsement and if you have sight now it's hurtful so you may
[02:24.560 --> 02:29.600]  have to lose your eyesight just like you can't say mother or father or he or she that's hurtful
[02:29.600 --> 02:36.640]  to those that do not consider themselves a sex your existence is evil and I'm not kidding I'm
[02:36.640 --> 02:42.240]  going to play the newscast we're with a straight face on bandcroft television this is the trans
[02:42.240 --> 02:46.880]  abled and I told you that the gouging out of the eyeballs the chopping of the genitals off
[02:46.880 --> 02:51.600]  the chopping of the arms and legs off is super trendy and is spreading all over the world right
[02:51.600 --> 02:59.680]  now and taxpayers must pay for it all and the housing of what they call I'm not even going to
[02:59.680 --> 03:04.480]  tell you what they call it but people live in boxes with their arms and legs cut off and then
[03:04.480 --> 03:11.280]  wear diapers and then the trendies dance around and this is it's their religious sacrament and I'm
[03:11.280 --> 03:16.400]  not kidding when I talk about this this is this is what you've got to accept you're bigoted and
[03:16.400 --> 03:22.000]  you're hateful and Nambla of course is out saying give us your six-year-olds or you're not trendy
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.720]  and you're racist and this is where it's all going oh and by the way our story is on drudgerport.com
[03:27.920 --> 03:32.400]  and they didn't do this just in one photo they did it too I discovered this on sunday and I wanted
[03:32.400 --> 03:35.360]  to have an article written about it I didn't get around to telling the writers what we're going to
[03:35.360 --> 03:39.760]  do it because I found another photo shop where they did it as well but they thought it was a
[03:39.760 --> 03:46.880]  little too much to remove his his three black molds they've removed his molds I guess those were too
[03:47.600 --> 03:51.760]  too black because the guy's mixed race he didn't kill folks because he was black and white he killed
[03:51.760 --> 03:58.480]  him because he was a psychopathic anti-christian trendy but seeing in saying oh it's an accident
[03:58.480 --> 04:04.480]  you know that's just what we didn't really do that on purpose where they took a guy that clearly
[04:04.480 --> 04:11.760]  looks like he's part african and part caucasian and part hispanic or something and they turned him
[04:11.760 --> 04:17.200]  as white as a piece of tissue paper I mean he looks like Casper the friendly ghost like he's
[04:17.200 --> 04:23.200]  about to float through a wall or something Casper the friendly ghost friendliest ghost you know
[04:23.200 --> 04:29.600]  he goes into the school with stolen guns but he got illegal and shoots all the christians so it's
[04:29.600 --> 04:36.240]  the christian conservatives fault Obama loves you because Casper said so excuse me I'm just going
[04:36.240 --> 04:41.360]  a little too crazy here looking at this so that's all coming up Hillary says she's the most transparent
[04:41.360 --> 04:50.240]  person in history I'm not even gonna respond to that's got some bad news the old reach on pacific
[04:50.240 --> 04:56.080]  rim trade pack of course they they picture like it's a trade deal it's a total world government
[04:56.080 --> 05:04.320]  being aligned right now kit daniels infoworse.com cnn reportedly altered the photo of the biracial
[05:04.320 --> 05:08.800]  organ shooter to make him look more white now that's a shocking revelation so let me repeat that
[05:08.800 --> 05:13.520]  cnn apparently doctored the photo of the biracial organ shooter Christopher Mercer to make people
[05:13.520 --> 05:18.720]  think he's caucasian Mercer uploaded a selfie to social media but when cnn used the photo in
[05:18.720 --> 05:23.680]  its news broadcast Mercer's skin tone had dramatically changed that of a white man further
[05:23.680 --> 05:28.720]  more cnn did not show photos of Mercer's mother who was african-american and the network also
[05:28.720 --> 05:32.880]  didn't report that Mercer was involved in the school play which contradicts the media's claim
[05:32.880 --> 05:37.680]  that he was a loner why would they do that because a biracial organ shooter does not fit into the
[05:37.680 --> 05:42.240]  establishment's propaganda that mass shooters are white racist men they also don't want you know
[05:42.240 --> 05:46.320]  that Mercer was associated with the black lives matter movement because it would be a political
[05:46.320 --> 05:50.880]  nightmare for Obama if the public knew the truth it'd be hard for him to demand more gun control
[05:50.880 --> 05:55.440]  if more people started to realize that President Obama is fueling racial division across the U.S.

[09:13.440 --> 09:19.520]  globally the agreement has been reached the washington post is reporting but will remain secret from
[09:19.520 --> 09:31.200]  the public thought i'd pause on that one also this little tidbit out of the new york post delta
[09:31.200 --> 09:42.720]  force considered staging fake hijacking after 9 11 well the truth is there was a staged attack on
[09:42.720 --> 09:50.800]  an aircraft by mutalib to bring in the naked body scanners and we know that was staged we know the
[09:50.800 --> 09:56.880]  cia put the drug youth on the aircraft so the firecracker could go off in his pants not so they
[09:56.880 --> 10:01.520]  could stop radical islamic extremism but so they could roll out the police state checkpoints
[10:01.520 --> 10:08.720]  against the american people while leaving the borders wide open they've never caught one terrorist
[10:08.720 --> 10:14.160]  with all the tsa garbage now the tsa was out for the pope in three different cities setting up
[10:14.160 --> 10:22.240]  checkpoints up to five miles away and not letting cars travel on the streets anywhere after 9 30 p.m
[10:22.240 --> 10:32.800]  jacari jackson and david night had to walk i think they said four plus miles to their hotel
[10:34.240 --> 10:39.520]  with their bags and equipment in america because their plane landed at 9 o'clock at night
[10:40.880 --> 10:46.880]  and they ran into military and tsa and border patrol but none of them were on the border itself
[10:46.880 --> 10:56.880]  that's coming up let me just read you some of the political correctness headlines today
[10:58.320 --> 11:06.240]  lesbian swedish bishop wants christian crosses removed from churches to please muslims replace
[11:06.240 --> 11:18.320]  the symbols with making and marking the direction of mecca to replace the crosses with islamic symbols
[11:18.320 --> 11:21.440]  to be politically correct because your christian culture is hurtful
[11:24.240 --> 11:31.600]  here's another one feminist fall for four-chan troll campaign by peeing themselves
[11:31.600 --> 11:39.760]  four-chan the popular hacking site put out the meme that feminists should urinate on themselves
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.680]  to prove that they're true feminists and of course they did it and posted the photos of
[11:45.680 --> 11:52.640]  themselves doing it in mass uh let's continue with the political correctness news cnn turns
[11:52.640 --> 11:58.960]  mixed race origan shooter into a white man that story is on drudge report dot com la times claims
[11:58.960 --> 12:06.400]  mercer was a white supremacist even though he was an admitted leftist who lived with his mommy
[12:06.400 --> 12:13.520]  and hated christians but now a guy that was part black and part white was turned white and and go
[12:13.520 --> 12:18.880]  back to it his nose was made smaller what do you visit michael jackson surgeon
[12:18.880 --> 12:30.640]  oh but cnn now is saying it's an accident it's an accident and in other photos they've been
[12:30.640 --> 12:39.360]  lightning his skin as well and then you compare them and then obama is out blaming gun owners
[12:39.360 --> 12:46.800]  hillary has said that she's going to never relent that's a quote in the eradication of the second
[12:46.800 --> 12:54.240]  amendment oh but it gets better uh just a few minutes before i went on air richard one of the
[12:54.240 --> 12:59.440]  crew members walked in and said you never covered this i noticed did you know about it and i did
[12:59.440 --> 13:04.240]  know about it but it's one of those things where i do moments my research at home at my home office
[13:04.240 --> 13:09.600]  and then i just tend to forget once i get up here to pull it back up or i tend to send
[13:09.600 --> 13:16.800]  interesting messages over to the crew of stories but obama administration and you
[13:16.800 --> 13:23.200]  and announce global police force to fight extremism in u.s that's breitbart from the 29th we're
[13:23.200 --> 13:28.960]  talking six days ago i didn't cover excuse me i'm glad you pointed it out i mean people call
[13:28.960 --> 13:32.400]  up sometimes go why did you cover this because i didn't know there's so much i don't know everything
[13:32.400 --> 13:36.880]  i don't know a lot of stuff folks it's so much worse than i always say nine times out of ten
[13:36.880 --> 13:44.240]  we're not exaggerating it's worse than we're saying that's what's crazy about it is that it
[13:44.240 --> 13:49.520]  sounds like i'm exaggerating sometimes here they are having the stasi reactivated in in europe
[13:50.880 --> 13:51.680]  in germany
[13:54.560 --> 13:58.800]  like i said in the news today they're officially turning it back on no not just hiring former
[13:58.800 --> 14:04.320]  stasi just at facebook's hiring former stasi themselves who then call the stasi this new
[14:04.320 --> 14:10.640]  german directorate made of stasi who then take your children away that was in the news yesterday
[14:10.640 --> 14:15.280]  we can pull that up from info wars dot com it links to mainstream german newspapers
[14:17.360 --> 14:20.960]  where with a straight face they say that the
[14:23.600 --> 14:24.560]  german bar
[14:27.600 --> 14:32.080]  is basically ordering people to be on the lookout who criticize open borders
[14:32.080 --> 14:36.960]  and that the children need to be taken from the parents because they're being taught cultural
[14:36.960 --> 14:45.440]  xenophobia i mean this is ultra massive totalitarianism so over the top it makes my mind spin
[14:49.200 --> 14:54.240]  but before i hit any of this incredible news that's just some that's just some i covered
[14:54.240 --> 15:02.160]  three stacks here i've got nine other stacks nine other stacks i haven't even mentioned to you
[15:02.720 --> 15:09.760]  that are just as insane i want to explain why it's all happening today because this is the key
[15:10.640 --> 15:18.240]  one of many keys one of the key keys the skeleton key to understand why they're doing all this
[15:18.240 --> 15:25.040]  when half the public is dying of cancer by 2030 and that's even in british newspapers
[15:28.080 --> 15:35.040]  when half the newborn babies by 2030 or so have neurological disorders autism spectrum disorders
[15:36.160 --> 15:40.160]  this is the current cdc projection one in three by 2025
[15:40.160 --> 15:46.480]  when almost everyone you know is dead or dying or being kept alive by bizarre
[15:47.280 --> 15:52.880]  transmutogenic genetic engineering so we're gonna have to give up our humanity just to live
[15:52.880 --> 15:57.680]  because the globalists have treatments and cures for everything they're they're deploying against us
[15:58.480 --> 16:03.760]  the stuff we see now is 50 year old medicine they're gonna accelerate the rollout of life
[16:03.760 --> 16:10.240]  extension you name it and an incredible designer drugs where the public won't care it is going to
[16:10.240 --> 16:15.280]  be a total war on consciousness getting us ready for the singularity the merger with machines
[16:16.080 --> 16:22.240]  and the new creation the globalists want to be god they want to play god they believe they're
[16:22.240 --> 16:27.840]  becoming gods every one of them says this they have huge conferences where tens of thousands of
[16:27.840 --> 16:33.520]  billionaires and millionaires and rich people and stars go at closed resorts you know william
[16:33.520 --> 16:39.120]  shatner comes and speaks and you know it's all exciting it's fun they're not even bad people
[16:39.120 --> 16:45.920]  they're the level below the very top they're the ones seduced in and why wouldn't you be for life
[16:45.920 --> 16:56.480]  extension why wouldn't you be uh to be you know let in to all this advanced cia uh drugs and
[16:56.480 --> 17:03.840]  everything else this the elite have to offer i mean it's hard to not sell out to this satanic
[17:03.840 --> 17:10.000]  system believe me i've got an idea and i i know some of the things they've got and it's it's tempting
[17:12.720 --> 17:18.960]  very very tempting but i know it kills the soul and i know it's a trap and down the road it is
[17:18.960 --> 17:27.760]  nothing but total darkness but the reason they're doing this
[17:30.480 --> 17:36.960]  the reason they are advertising the craziest stuff and pushing the weirdest things in the
[17:36.960 --> 17:41.920]  national post in canada saying taxpayers should pay for people to have their arms and legs cut off
[17:41.920 --> 17:52.000]  and you're you're a trans abled phobic redneck if you don't want to pay to have somebody's arms
[17:52.000 --> 17:56.320]  and legs cut off and pay to have them kept in a government facility in a box so that their
[17:56.320 --> 18:01.680]  lover can come have sex with them and i'm sorry to have to talk about stuff like this but this
[18:01.680 --> 18:10.880]  is the next wave to be force fed down our throats and so that's why they've got to normalize all
[18:10.880 --> 18:19.760]  this craziness so that things are so scrambled so that there's not any rudder where anything goes
[18:20.560 --> 18:26.720]  so we won't care when our neighbors are being drug off to a fema camp so we won't care if they're
[18:26.720 --> 18:30.800]  putting psychotropics in all the kids school lunches that's what's being announced in the next
[18:30.800 --> 18:37.280]  phase so we won't care when we're buying and selling with biometrics so we won't care when
[18:37.280 --> 18:42.640]  half the people on the block are dying of cancer or neurological disorders it's just got to be
[18:42.640 --> 18:48.800]  totally insane whacked out wild you're not going to have tax rebates for having kids
[18:48.800 --> 18:53.040]  you're going to have tax rebates for gouging your eyeballs out with hot pokers
[18:55.600 --> 19:01.200]  and they just put it on the news with a straight face burn your eyes out with drayno it's sexy
[19:01.200 --> 19:08.480]  it's cool these people are poor sad folks but this is who they really are you need to accept it but
[19:11.600 --> 19:15.120]  you also got a lot of a man come in the restroom with you because they feel like they're a woman
[19:16.080 --> 19:20.560]  but a normal heterosexual relationship is oppressive of women and should be banned
[19:20.560 --> 19:30.560]  it is the injection of mass mental illness with rudderless mindless dumbed down domesticated
[19:31.520 --> 19:38.160]  people raised by liberals now these new people are just begging for death
[19:38.880 --> 19:42.400]  begging for destruction their religion is hating themselves
[19:43.360 --> 19:48.640]  and getting ahold of your children and it's just to lay the groundwork for us to fall like an
[19:48.640 --> 19:54.080]  old rotten dead tree in a high wind because the mass extermination of the general public
[19:54.080 --> 19:58.000]  comes after this this is just the softening up phase we'll break it down on the other side
[19:59.440 --> 20:03.840]  most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega threes is a good idea
[20:03.840 --> 20:08.240]  but did you know that about 60 percent of americans are actually deficient in omega threes did you
[20:08.240 --> 20:13.680]  know that most fish oil products contain only about 25 omega threes and the remaining 75 percent
[20:13.680 --> 20:18.560]  is undesirable fish fat heck did you know that more than 90 percent of fish oil supplements sold in

[24:15.440 --> 24:18.800]  all attacks pair expense here is part of the sickening report
[24:22.560 --> 24:31.200]  b i i d means that you have a need to be disabled in some way in my case it was a need to go blind
[24:31.840 --> 24:37.600]  nine years ago jewell took the drastic decision to blind herself and she researched the method she
[24:37.600 --> 24:44.960]  would use i found that lie is very painful although it does get the job done i found that
[24:44.960 --> 24:52.560]  drain cleaner is little less painful although it does a lot of damage to the eye because drain
[24:52.560 --> 24:59.040]  cleaner was easily available to me i went with that she found a psychologist willing to help her
[24:59.040 --> 25:04.240]  and after two weeks of working together to make sure she was ready they carried out jewell's plan
[25:04.240 --> 25:13.520]  i laid down on the sofa and he sat next to me drop two drops into each eye my eyes were screaming
[25:13.520 --> 25:22.000]  i had some drain cleaner going down my cheek for earning my skin in the moment all i could think of
[25:22.000 --> 25:28.160]  was i'm going blind it's going to be okay after waiting half an hour to make sure the damage was
[25:28.160 --> 25:34.640]  done the psychologist took jewell to hospital where doctors fought to save her sight when i woke up
[25:34.640 --> 25:45.680]  the following day i was joyful until i turned on my back opened my eyes and could see the tv screen
[25:45.680 --> 25:57.280]  i was so enraged and i thought that it hadn't worked then over about six months the site in
[25:57.280 --> 26:06.560]  both eyes slowly went away i was so happy i felt that this was who i was supposed to be okay that's
[26:06.560 --> 26:14.560]  enough and that's barcroft television out of the uk it's worldwide the full video is up on info
[26:14.560 --> 26:20.960]  wars dot com and a story pouring pouring drain cleaner in your eyes the new trendy social justice
[26:20.960 --> 26:26.400]  movement not supporting people who want to blind themselves is bigoted and intolerant and having
[26:26.400 --> 26:30.560]  the name mother or father boy or girl hurts people that don't have a mother or father or
[26:31.280 --> 26:38.160]  who aren't a boy or girl so you can't use that word because you existing is hateful
[26:40.160 --> 26:46.800]  and europeans existing is wrong they have major members of the uk and german and french government
[26:46.800 --> 26:52.480]  in the last month on television we've ran the articles saying it's good we've opened the borders
[26:52.480 --> 26:57.920]  up to the middle east because it's bad that europe has white people and it's good they're all about
[26:57.920 --> 27:04.640]  to be gone well i'm not against north africans or erobs but a lot of them have picked up the
[27:04.640 --> 27:09.200]  chant yeah we're coming to breed you out we're gonna conquer you you're weak because the government
[27:09.200 --> 27:16.160]  says come in we're weak take us over and i talked to paul watson about this a few weeks ago i said
[27:16.160 --> 27:23.040]  what do you think it is and he said i think it's cuckolding and i said you mean where a woman
[27:23.040 --> 27:27.520]  basically like dominates her husband in front of another man and the man has sex with her i don't
[27:27.520 --> 27:32.080]  mean to talk about this on air folks but this is psychology and he goes yes exactly and i said
[27:32.080 --> 27:37.040]  you're absolutely right that's what i think it is and no one else was really saying this we both
[27:37.040 --> 27:42.960]  understood it's like a weird form of domination it's it's it's sato masochistic where they are
[27:42.960 --> 27:54.880]  the sadists are just taking anything that was powerful strong and an original culture and
[27:54.880 --> 27:58.640]  destroying and they want to destroy the third world as well they've done that they try to keep
[27:58.640 --> 28:05.680]  the third world in squalor and they are the masters of this planet and they want to normalize
[28:05.680 --> 28:14.400]  pouring drain cleaner in your eyes and making us pay for it because they're evil the globalists
[28:14.400 --> 28:19.920]  are sick they have to normalize that invert reality and say those of us that want to go
[28:19.920 --> 28:25.120]  for a jog in the morning that enjoy a beautiful sunset that enjoy a loving relationship with
[28:25.120 --> 28:32.320]  somebody of the opposite sex who want to raise good children who just love decency and don't
[28:32.320 --> 28:39.120]  love degeneracy we're the enemy and look i get being corrupt i get doing bad things
[28:40.320 --> 28:45.280]  not to this extent but but i understand everybody's got another side to them but you
[28:45.280 --> 28:53.680]  get into that side you'll end up alone lonely very low life expectancy very poor people that get into
[28:53.680 --> 29:01.360]  degeneracy are losers and they want to make all the rest of us losers because losers love company
[29:01.360 --> 29:09.200]  this woman is fabulously mentally ill fabulously a self-hater fabulously wants attention
[29:11.120 --> 29:16.640]  and she wants to make you pay for it and then she found another twisted individual
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.120]  who wanted to come be part of this and do this to her
[29:24.880 --> 29:31.040]  and it's an act of dominating reality that they can do something obscene like take someone's sight
[29:31.040 --> 29:35.200]  when so many millions of people that are blind would give anything for it they take a gift like
[29:35.200 --> 29:41.840]  that and create vandalism on god's creation that woman sacrificed her eyes because she's demon
[29:41.840 --> 29:47.920]  possessed whether it's a demon whether it's uh whether it's an archetype whatever it is the woman
[29:47.920 --> 29:55.280]  is infested we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:55.280 --> 30:03.840]  get daniels info wars dot com president obama implied that the federal government should
[30:03.840 --> 30:08.320]  confiscate all guns that's right the president responsible for the deaths of women and children
[30:08.320 --> 30:12.480]  via drone strikes is now trying to eradicate second amendment when obama responded to the
[30:12.480 --> 30:16.880]  october first attack on an oregon community college he went beyond his usual demand for more
[30:16.880 --> 30:21.360]  gun control and suggested that america should consider outright banning guns just like australia
[30:21.360 --> 30:25.760]  and great britain but it's hypocritical for obama to demand that americans turning their guns win
[30:25.760 --> 30:30.160]  according to the pentagon the obama administration is backing isis in its war against the syrian
[30:30.160 --> 30:35.600]  government in fact in september 2013 president obama waived a federal law specifically designed
[30:35.600 --> 30:40.320]  to keep the us government from supplying firearms and terrorist groups such as isis on the very same
[30:40.320 --> 30:45.280]  day he demanded more gun control in response to the dc navy yard shooting in other words obama is
[30:45.280 --> 30:50.640]  shipping guns to islamic militants aka moderate rebels while simultaneously trying to disarm

[35:56.000 --> 36:00.640]  then now we know they're selling baby parts in mass and that 87 percent of Planned Parenthoods
[36:00.640 --> 36:07.360]  profits are not from even government funding hundreds of millions a year or from the women
[36:07.360 --> 36:13.280]  paying for abortions because they charge women less than the abortions actually cost to incentivize
[36:13.280 --> 36:18.800]  the women coming in so they don't know the secret that they're making thousands of dollars
[36:18.800 --> 36:26.160]  per abortion even on the small fetuses and in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars
[36:26.160 --> 36:34.000]  on an eight month fully formed baby and now it's come out over the weekend in China what we already
[36:34.000 --> 36:41.200]  knew but it's mainstream news it's on info wars dot com from Reuters and other publications that
[36:41.200 --> 36:48.400]  China is keeping Falun Gong prisoners alive and is harvesting organs and then basically keeping
[36:48.400 --> 36:55.360]  them in comas to come back and get the other organs and that they're also keeping people
[36:55.360 --> 37:00.960]  alive on the tarmac while they harvest them then killing them and then flying the organs into
[37:00.960 --> 37:06.800]  japan for delivery i was told this by Falun Gong insiders on the show more than a decade ago
[37:06.800 --> 37:11.680]  it's now mainstream news prisoners in China had their livers kidneys and corneas ripped
[37:11.680 --> 37:19.680]  it while alive the Daily Mail is just one of the publications i said i'd give you the key
[37:19.680 --> 37:22.720]  the key has already been placed right in front of you i'm sure most of you see it
[37:24.080 --> 37:30.720]  they're getting ready to unleash hell the uk government announced two months ago they would
[37:30.720 --> 37:38.480]  not tolerate free speech anymore of conservatives the uk government announced today
[37:38.480 --> 37:44.800]  10 downing street that civil rights and human rights is no longer their priority
[37:45.360 --> 37:52.640]  that they are going to totalitarianism these are naked brazen announcements Germany has
[37:52.640 --> 37:57.280]  reactivated the stasi and is taking children from people that criticize the socialist government
[37:57.280 --> 38:05.600]  in any way america has now established with the un directorate mainstream news
[38:05.600 --> 38:15.600]  a global police force to fight extremism cnn takes a mixed race socialist anti-christian
[38:15.600 --> 38:21.680]  devil worshiper who hated christians and wanted to kill him and probably committed the mass
[38:21.680 --> 38:25.680]  shooting to demonize the second amendment we're seeing more and more of that as a false flag
[38:25.680 --> 38:30.640]  himself not directed but himself carrying it out as an agent of evil and they turn him
[38:30.640 --> 38:36.640]  him cheat white like a ghost and say he was a white supremacist in the la times and cnn and even
[38:36.640 --> 38:44.640]  made his nose more cocazoid oh i'm sorry that's a scientific word i'm racist caucasian
[38:49.120 --> 38:53.840]  they don't play games ladies and gentlemen they made his lips smaller his nose smaller and
[38:53.840 --> 39:01.680]  turned him deathly white only people i ever saw that white were corpses turn the poor fella
[39:02.240 --> 39:09.280]  into a walking dead so they could continue their race division because the truth is there's black
[39:09.280 --> 39:13.840]  crazies there's white crazies there's Hispanic crazies there's asian crazies there's bad people
[39:13.840 --> 39:18.720]  out there and that's why we have guns to protect ourselves from them and boy don't they wish he
[39:18.720 --> 39:23.040]  was whites that feed into their whole narrative to try to stir up a bigger race war in this country
[39:23.040 --> 39:30.000]  all the globalist wage war against us all so that's the final equation they need to normalize
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.920]  pouring drain oh in your eyes they need to have scores of shows about the world after humans
[39:33.920 --> 39:38.640]  and how bad people are and teach us to hate ourselves and teach us to hate our life force
[39:39.600 --> 39:46.080]  and teach us to believe we're losers and failures so society and civilization collapses they've
[39:46.080 --> 39:51.280]  taken out the family for all intentions purposes now they're trying to take out the man and woman
[39:51.280 --> 40:00.000]  relationship they're trying to build in all the taxes so that it's not easily done so that
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.200]  everybody's alone everybody's stupid no one has any culture every culture is evil every culture is
[40:05.200 --> 40:12.560]  bad anything that pre existed before the new world order must be erased disappeared culturally
[40:12.560 --> 40:25.040]  purged genocide and in its place leather daddy conferences with men marching slaves on chains
[40:25.040 --> 40:30.800]  down the street in chicago with their eyes sewn shut remember buckley moved to chicago like 11
[40:30.800 --> 40:35.280]  years ago and lived in a higher-ice next door to a major hotel and he walked in one morning to get
[40:35.280 --> 40:41.760]  brunch there and there was a quote gay conference and there were people just like in leather everywhere
[40:41.760 --> 40:46.800]  and slaves and men on chains with their eyes shown shut like something on a hellraiser
[40:49.600 --> 40:52.800]  then i learned about movements and awesome where folks had their arms and legs cut off
[40:52.800 --> 40:57.120]  then i saw it then i learned that people that go in and like to be shot by guns because they're like
[40:57.120 --> 41:03.760]  the bullet hole scars and i told people about it and people didn't even believe me this is all
[41:03.760 --> 41:09.200]  government globalist psychiatrically funded and pushed to bring down civilization
[41:09.200 --> 41:16.720]  and then they call it liberal and they giggle and laugh at you like insane cult members when
[41:16.720 --> 41:26.000]  you tell them they're being taught to hate themselves as they induct people into these lifestyles
[41:27.920 --> 41:33.440]  i mean can you quote be gay oh let me use the term they ordered me to use no can you be homosexual
[41:33.440 --> 41:40.320]  and end up dying at 85 years old married to someone you love of the same sex and have a good
[41:40.320 --> 41:44.960]  life and a good culture yes very rarely there are cases of it but if you look statistically the
[41:44.960 --> 41:53.280]  suicide the the the abuse the drugs the the degeneracy the mutilation is off the chart
[41:53.280 --> 41:58.640]  it's the most unhappy group of people in the world then they sell the idea that well that's
[41:58.640 --> 42:04.160]  because you heard us and were mean to us and didn't embrace us really there have been cultures
[42:04.160 --> 42:10.960]  where it's been fully embraced by the government and they promptly collapse this has been done
[42:10.960 --> 42:16.880]  to cause the collapse of civilization because the globalists are developing high-tech reservations
[42:16.880 --> 42:21.280]  that are exempt from the taxes from the cultural degradation that are separate
[42:21.280 --> 42:29.040]  you don't get into the globalist proto elysium bases that are on the ground
[42:29.040 --> 42:34.000]  and that are on artificial islands and being established you don't get on to those things
[42:34.000 --> 42:41.120]  when you buy into any of this stuff that is a cultural poison put out there to neutralize
[42:41.120 --> 42:46.640]  society do you think the very same government in the 60s that introduced homosexuality the
[42:46.640 --> 42:52.080]  schools and the culture and the movies and the literature the little front men like gordo doll
[42:52.080 --> 42:59.280]  who meant well do you think those same people really cared about you when they were putting
[42:59.280 --> 43:06.480]  hiv and hepatitis shots at clinics in new york and san francisco to give gay men hiv the first
[43:06.480 --> 43:12.400]  weaponized true strain hiv is just a whole cover for a whole bunch of different strains they've
[43:12.400 --> 43:20.560]  developed and it attacks people that already have rundown immune systems and it's racially based
[43:21.920 --> 43:29.440]  but because Caucasians are so closely aligned to Africans genetically you still get crossover
[43:29.440 --> 43:34.960]  it could still kill white people but you've noticed how many black folks have it you could
[43:34.960 --> 43:44.000]  sneeze if you got hiv you give a black person it not of your wife so let's talk about reality here
[43:44.000 --> 43:52.160]  ladies and gentlemen let's talk about what's being done they are just testing wholesale
[43:52.160 --> 43:57.120]  rollouts of nightmares all over latin america they don't get their imf and world bank money
[43:58.080 --> 44:04.400]  unless they give between 10 and 13 year old girls the garter still shot on record that attacks the
[44:04.400 --> 44:15.680]  ovaries on record attacks their entire reproductive system wow you guys actually found an article
[44:15.680 --> 44:23.040]  scroll back down on that to the top that's us news health report i didn't know that print that for me
[44:23.040 --> 44:32.480]  i remember my dad in like 1987 explaining to me that hiv was a government bio weapons program
[44:32.480 --> 44:38.640]  targeting blacks and that the whites don't have the receptor sites on the telemphysites to accept
[44:38.640 --> 44:44.400]  the virus but it could still get in there was enough of a flood of it and that it was a very sad
[44:44.400 --> 44:52.080]  program to wipe out minorities and i asked him how he knew and he just said i know people i'll
[44:52.080 --> 44:58.080]  bring him in here and interrogate him thing is he'll never tell me anything and he said oh literature
[44:58.080 --> 45:06.400]  literature last time i asked him but there it is right there in us news and world report
[45:08.560 --> 45:13.200]  genetic trait boost aids risk in blacks wow i didn't even know they admitted that that was uh
[45:16.080 --> 45:19.200]  in 2008 wow okay let me go back to the garter cell real quick
[45:20.640 --> 45:25.440]  garter sill when they did the trials killed a bunch of people in the us japan has banned it
[45:25.440 --> 45:32.960]  india won't let you give it to kids and they go and they give the little girls this and people
[45:32.960 --> 45:37.200]  say well alex you're against open borders you're against all these illegals why don't you let the
[45:37.200 --> 45:42.240]  un this is what liberals say don't you let the un go ahead and take these people out i don't hate
[45:42.240 --> 45:48.800]  mexicans i don't want them brought up here put on socialism and and and turn into globalist bots
[45:48.800 --> 45:53.200]  to then vote to take my guns and bring in the socialist revolution so i'm dependent so i can
[45:53.200 --> 45:58.320]  have health care and medical decisions dictated to me part of the eugenics program but i don't
[45:58.320 --> 46:06.240]  want to kill them the reproductive production of mexican women it's so one-dimensional people have
[46:06.240 --> 46:11.360]  to understand folks when you're hanging around with an NAACP leader in most cities or you're
[46:11.360 --> 46:17.680]  hanging around with a liberal they're not liberal folks when you're hanging around with a high power
[46:17.680 --> 46:24.720]  democrat you're basically hanging around in most cases with with a group above the kukluks clan
[46:24.720 --> 46:30.160]  the kukluks clan is in their dialectic the dumb group that they use to just create war against
[46:30.160 --> 46:35.200]  white people and to make any type of you know anglo rights or culture look bad because they
[46:35.200 --> 46:38.800]  don't like that either they don't want any culture the globalists don't control anything strong
[46:39.840 --> 46:41.600]  but they really don't like black people
[46:41.600 --> 46:48.640]  the globalists really hate them and that's why they got the blacks right underneath their wing
[46:49.200 --> 46:52.080]  right there going i'm going to give you free stuff i'm going to pay your
[46:52.080 --> 46:55.600]  women not to have men in the house and i'm going to put gangster rap out there to make your men
[46:55.600 --> 46:59.760]  think it's cool so they dress and act like it the police are primed and trained to put you in
[46:59.760 --> 47:03.600]  prison then we're going to train your leaders to say kill the cops so that you'll kill the cops so
[47:03.600 --> 47:08.080]  the cops will even attack you more so we can put all of you in prison now you go ahead i'm your daddy
[47:08.080 --> 47:16.160]  al sharpton with a rockefeller foundation hand up my puppet area and you just do what i said now
[47:16.160 --> 47:26.240]  you go right out there and play in traffic i mean you're not going to make it to the next level
[47:26.240 --> 47:31.440]  of development ladies and gentlemen unless you love everybody and that means every race every
[47:31.440 --> 47:35.840]  color every creed and you love their humanity but that but then they take those of us that have
[47:35.840 --> 47:40.960]  love in our hearts and they manipulate it and say good except everything except draino in the eyes
[47:40.960 --> 47:45.840]  pay for sex changes pay for abortions let us have your kids and tell them how to be sexually active
[47:45.840 --> 47:51.680]  when they're seven years old do what we say submit to us show us how moral and good you are and how
[47:51.680 --> 48:00.640]  open you are and how tolerant you are so that we tolerate cultural death and you notice now they're
[48:00.640 --> 48:06.080]  saying facebook has 50 different sexual preferences you can say you are including no sex and in the
[48:06.080 --> 48:14.080]  future you will be asexual unsexual drone creatures under the un plan this is all admitted by julian
[48:14.080 --> 48:20.160]  huxley the father of transhumanism they don't want you having passion you know how much they hate
[48:20.160 --> 48:25.200]  seeing men and women together loving each other you know how much they hate the incredible
[48:25.200 --> 48:31.600]  office of a man and woman really loving each other and coming together that is so powerful i mean i
[48:31.600 --> 48:35.680]  used to read stuff when i was like 22 on this and i'd go this only didn't that bad they want people
[48:35.680 --> 48:40.000]  to be sexually active and get women out there i kind of like that because i was young and wild
[48:40.000 --> 48:46.240]  you know stupid and talking to everything now i understand because then you don't learn how
[48:46.240 --> 48:51.920]  to make that incredible bond with the right woman that's made by pheromones and courting and other
[48:51.920 --> 48:59.360]  things that last a lifetime and will shepherd children and build a powerful house so they went
[48:59.360 --> 49:03.920]  in and they said birth control be sexually promiscuous have fun it's great blah blah and
[49:03.920 --> 49:08.640]  yeah it's fun in the first level of it until you get the second level the third level the fourth
[49:08.640 --> 49:13.280]  level because let's not just sit here and criticize sexually active gay people let's talk about what
[49:13.280 --> 49:21.200]  heterosexuals do let's talk about how destructive that is long term and believe me i'm not up here
[49:21.200 --> 49:27.200]  on some high horse folks uh you know i'm no eril flinn but let me tell you i've never had a problem
[49:27.200 --> 49:36.320]  with the ladies i have just been through it i can tell you it's not fulfilling down the road
[49:36.320 --> 49:46.080]  long term a real relationship is monogamous and so they scientifically sabotage our strength
[49:46.080 --> 49:52.480]  they scientifically are bringing us down this is the scientific fall of humanity and it's
[49:52.480 --> 49:56.880]  going to get crazier and wilder because evils try to take over over and over again has failed
[49:56.880 --> 50:03.440]  time and time again and so it's throwing everything it can in a scorched earth policy to reduce all
[50:03.440 --> 50:09.760]  culture and they're going to ride the collapse of civilization down and out of the wreckage of that
[50:09.760 --> 50:16.240]  the globalists will emerge the only ones with advanced technology and will be the new gods of
[50:16.240 --> 50:22.960]  this planet and they even intend to keep villages of us around and old rotting cities of people and
[50:22.960 --> 50:27.760]  different sectors like the hunger games people kept saying you sound like the hunger games now i was
[50:27.760 --> 50:32.720]  saying that 20 years ago the hunger games is just an adaptation of what the globalists really want
[50:32.720 --> 50:41.040]  to do and that's it that's their plan by the way they're going to keep some of us around maybe 100
[50:41.040 --> 50:45.760]  million is the standard number in their documents they're going to kill seven plus billion people
[50:46.800 --> 50:50.720]  in the collapse and i don't know when the big collapse is coming because there are many
[50:51.280 --> 50:55.120]  collapses before that getting us ready but this is their plan you've been warned

[56:26.000 --> 56:30.960]  reasons we're under such government scrutiny right now is because of whistleblowers documents things
[56:30.960 --> 56:35.760]  like that I've gotten to the point where I can't even respond to whistleblowers anymore because of
[56:37.120 --> 56:42.800]  the fact that I've basically been told that's the issue and it's not that I'm afraid to do it it's
[56:42.800 --> 56:51.360]  it's that they will arrest me and plus we already know they're so mad about Tosh Plumlee folks and
[56:51.360 --> 56:57.200]  Benghazi and all that and colonel Schaefer and it's like okay what more whistleblowers proving it I
[56:57.200 --> 57:02.640]  don't even want to know okay they carried it out was it was staged there you go I mean at a certain
[57:02.640 --> 57:08.080]  point how do you beat a dead horse anymore it's just I don't even have time to cover all the leads
[57:08.080 --> 57:13.600]  and all the proof it's just it's the government runs secret baby harvesting operations Pepsi puts
[57:13.600 --> 57:22.000]  baby flavoring it I mean you know they're evil people and they're going for broke they take
[57:22.000 --> 57:27.520]  down humanity the elite will control the whole future that's why they're so brutal it's they're

[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:03.840]  and says hate crime massacre of christians finally silences obama except it hasn't obama still
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.800]  running around blaming individual gun owners for what some psychopath did with guns he got
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:16.000]  illegally by the way google's parent company is dropping the don't be evil motto oh that's really
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.720]  funny uk admits human rights no longer a priority of british foreign policy and they've announced
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:30.080]  domestically as well that is just some of what's coming up but don't worry about the secret trade
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:37.040]  deal but even it was a great deal we shouldn't be for because it's secret we should have congress
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.400]  see it we should know what's in it of course it's totally horrible just the sections we've gotten
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:45.280]  so over the top it's world government and they finally will then all vote and agree to it all
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:53.200]  and the overarching world tax program defunded in paris in december with this new global
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.280]  government treaty and it's called global government the pope calls it global government
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.880]  and then they got the southern poverty law center in adl wrote new articles the last few weeks saying
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:07.760]  i'm completely insane there is no such thing as a world government a carbon tax there's nothing
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:13.840]  under the state department a few years ago it came out and said china doesn't harvest organs
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.920]  china advertises they harvest political distance organs you see the level of brainwashing we're
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:24.320]  dealing with here it's like hillary back let's go out to break with this you can scramble and find
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:30.480]  that clip hillary dodges on email question claims to be the most transparent person in american
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:37.200]  history i mean hillary has become one of the most unintentionally funny people in america uh
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:42.960]  here she is on comedy central of course she wasn't on comedy central here it is do you get how bad it
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:49.200]  looks it looks like you set up a personal server you set up your own email so that you would have
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:54.400]  control of those emails like a giant snake alone would decide when to release them whether to release
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:04:00.240]  them and in fact that is what happened well savannah first of all it was allowed and i've said it
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:06.800]  wasn't the best choice and every government official gets to decide what is personal and work related
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:13.120]  if i'd had two separate accounts as many people do obviously i would have decided every hour what
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:19.360]  was personal what was work related the law also says that the official gets to determine that and
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:25.280]  that's what i did and i have gone further than anybody that i'm aware of in american history
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:29.680]  now that's not a long history because we haven't had emails that long but as long as we've had
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:35.600]  them i've gone longer and farther to try to be as transparent as possible nobody else has done that
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:40.240]  and by the time this is that's enough i'm a little you know i'm a little embarrassed ladies and
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:48.080]  gentlemen and she also invented the internet with al gore i mean this is her just enjoying
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:53.360]  lying the american people the the state been incredibly secretive the clinton's were incredibly
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:05:01.840]  secretive obama's been the most secretive ever hands down kit daniels info wars dot com cnn
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:06.320]  reportedly altered the photo of the biracial organ shooter to make him look more white now
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:10.880]  that's a shocking revelation so let me repeat that cnn apparently doctored the photo of the
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:15.680]  biracial organ shooter christopher mercer to make people think he's calcassian mercer uploaded a
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:21.360]  selfie to social media but when cnn used the photo in its news broadcast mercer's skin tone had
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:26.720]  dramatically changed that of a white man furthermore cnn did not show photos of mercer's mother who
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:31.040]  was african-american and the network also didn't report that mercer was involved in the school
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:35.520]  play which contradicts the media's claim that he was a loner why would they do that because a
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:40.080]  biracial organ shooter does not fit into the establishment's propaganda that mass shooters
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:44.080]  are white racist men they also don't let you know that mercer was associated with the black
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:48.080]  lives matter movement because it would be a political nightmare for obama if the public
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:52.400]  knew the truth it'd be hard for him to demand more gun control if more people started to realize
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:56.400]  that president obama is fueling racial division across the u.s. once again this is kit daniel

[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:24.240]  can't see the text of it uh that's going to be coming up and then of course this is really the
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:31.920]  top story this hour saudi's mole in their national conference of uh the the the royal family thousands
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:37.680]  of princes that's that's the government there saudi's mole launch of regional war as russia
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:42.960]  pounds targets in syria for fourth day where saudi arabia had claimed they were fighting isis and
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:47.920]  all this bull it's saudi arabia funding it quarter backing it giving them the weapons
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:53.280]  a bunch of other western countries are involved it's all come out and so they had some of their
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:57.840]  top government officials thursday and friday come out and say we're going to escalate the conflict
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:04.000]  with you if you don't pull out well the russians haven't so now we've got a whole slew of their
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.840]  government ministers in this excellent zero hedge article that goes through all the different
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:16.080]  publications with their quotes to give heavy weapons to the quote opposition to take on the russians
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:25.440]  so huge escalation towards what would become world war three
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:34.960]  now england is coming out cameron and criticizing the uk is criticizing the russians as well
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:41.440]  the russians have taken out the al-Nusra al-Qaeda bases roiders ap they all admit it is al-Qaeda
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:46.800]  that's that's what al-Nusra is that's the group in syria that's al-Qaeda in syria is the proper name
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.240]  they've taken them out they're now taking out isis
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:58.480]  isis is the group to be given control over part of iraq and part of syria to create a new
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:04.000]  Saudi run state that's not the main focus of russia right now it's got to take out the leadership
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.920]  the al-Qaeda leadership that basically commands isis al-Qaeda is the quote moderate group that's
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:16.400]  roiders i read that on there last week you know the u.s criticized the bombings at least 60 hits
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:25.120]  on al-Nusra al-Qaeda in syria base and they criticized them for doing that saying this is
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:29.840]  the moderate rebel group this is who we give the weapons to this is where we command and control
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:34.080]  how dare you blow it up they're moderate and putin said this is the command and control
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:40.000]  they're all the same people we're taking them out so they go and give them to moderate rebels
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  off the planes because our military gets mad a few years ago they were giving an actually to
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.480]  al-Qaeda we've had the whistleblowers on so now they just deliver it to guys that are basically
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:53.440]  delivery companies they then drive down the road the trucks and deliver it and the russians have
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:57.440]  been flying around blowing up these bases that when they hit them with a 500 pound bomb they blow
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:02.720]  up like they had a hundred thousand pounds on them because they do the russians are blowing up al-Qaeda
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:09.920]  weapons depots that are full of nato u.s israeli and saudi arabian and turkish weapons and yes
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:16.480]  i had a caller call in last week and go why are you just saying saudi arabia is involved in syria
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:24.160]  and 9 11 all this stuff saudi arabia is the main group that is going to run everything in the
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:32.560]  middle east it's the main client state but israel is involved turkeys involved every nato country
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:39.120]  is involved the united states they're all involved there's no one less involved okay it's all bad
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:44.000]  it's all evil let's get that straight it's this mindlessness where things turn into
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.400]  factionalization every time well you're not saying it's this group you're not saying they're all
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:57.040]  involved it's incredibly shameful and evil israel came out last week and said we may have to start
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:03.600]  taking out some strikes inside russia uh you know against some of the uh i mean inside syria
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:08.960]  since the russian forces came in because they're taking out some of the moderate rebels
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:18.320]  i mean we're really gotten to that point now so the plan is topple aside give saudi arabia
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:23.120]  control of at least half the country with this new islamic state it's going to set up so it can
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:27.600]  act like it's not in control of it and it's not running and and they came out again in the last
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:32.720]  year and said we're not involved we don't want to overthrow syria on and on and on and now that syria
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:36.720]  is fighting back with russia they're going okay that's it we're going to send in heavy weapons
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.160]  how dare you attack our forces
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:45.120]  and people have also asked why do you keep talking about the 28 pages and saudi arabian
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:49.440]  involvement in 9 11 clearly norad stood down clearly building seven clearly other other
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:54.080]  governments are involved our own government i made five films i wrote a book i was the first
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:14:02.160]  guy to expose 9 11 the 28 pages with the folks we're working with in congress will bring down
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:08.560]  the globalist to a great extent and will prove they stood down with four saudi arabia bare minimum
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:16.080]  that is aiding and abetting the attacks they're done it's like getting al capone on income tax fraud
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.760]  yeah he killed a bunch of people yeah he was involved in a bunch of bad stuff
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:27.280]  we have them they're fighting to not release it the commission went ahead and told the truth
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:32.800]  about what happened saudi arabia just supplied path seeks and at the start of the next hour
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.360]  remind me guys because i'm bad about getting cluttered in my mind i'm going to tie it all
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:44.000]  together with this headline delta force considered staging fake hijacking after 9 11 we know for a
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:51.200]  fact that delta force did mock responses to hijackings before 9 11 and i'm not giving out
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:56.480]  anything classified the cia admitted that the pentagon admitted that in the two years leading
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:04.960]  up to 9 11 they did more than 25 operations we know of and we know that mohammed atta and others
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:10.800]  were part of similar operations were at us military bases and were taking part in drills
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:12.960]  look it up
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.760]  they were part of drills so we don't know exactly what happened
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:29.120]  where they triple crossers i'm not even introducing that idea
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:37.280]  all i'm saying is we know the official story is as phony as hillary clinton's saying she's
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:43.360]  the most transparent person in u.s history or obama saying it's a conspiracy theory
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:48.000]  that he wants our guns as the gun groups they finance or for the total abolition of civilian
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.120]  ownership of firearms and places like chicago new york and dc they get total gun bans in place
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:56.640]  and they've done it all over the world and he sits there with a straight face and i'm going
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:05.440]  to your calls saying no one wants your guns so i don't know what happened on 9 11 i know there is
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:12.640]  so much evidence pointing in every direction that it was staged and there's a cover up and the whole
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:19.520]  thing is tied to one string the 28 pages you pull that 28 pages out it doesn't just blame saudi arabia
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:28.320]  it brings down the whole house of cards just like i told you syria four years ago
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.600]  if we could stop the take down syria and the fact that our government was funding al qaeda
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:36.320]  that would bring down the whole house of cards and we told you next stop it for libya with syria
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:43.440]  we know the globalist plan folks i know what i'm talking about i live this stuff the new world
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.920]  order is not invincible and you know why they're not invincible because there is a godness universe
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:52.720]  but even as important because it's the same statement they're good people in government
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:58.000]  they're good people in congress they're good people in corporations and private people
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.320]  the average person in government doesn't want to do this doesn't want baby flavoring and pepsi
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:08.480]  doesn't want to be funding al nuzra and al qaeda groups doesn't want to have cancer viruses in the
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:14.720]  polio shots but they're compartmentalized they get bullied they get attacked when they try to speak
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:20.560]  up and they're waiting for the people to not be cowards and stand up to give them the strength
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:28.320]  they need to clean things up that's why i want to do an intro for v for vendetta but not just
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:31.840]  the one we have where he takes over tv and he's talking to folks where he's talking to the police
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:36.960]  captain and he says why did you go public sooner why didn't you start fighting back earlier if you
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:45.200]  knew all this he said i was waiting for you inspector i was waiting for you see couldn't do it alone
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:51.840]  and so you want to know how to fix all this look in the mirror ladies and gentlemen
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:57.840]  i've always known that if i take action and get others to take action we can defeat these people
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:00.880]  because history shows that but if you don't believe in that then we don't have a chance we're going to

[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:10.320]  they just reminded me that i said he said this but why not actually play it it's like when he
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:15.200]  said that raising the debt limit doesn't raise the national debt you've got to play it to believe
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:20.000]  it or the clips where he says no one wants your guns no one's coming for your guns i mean that's
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.560]  as bad as marz attacks with the aliens running around shooting people saying don't run we are your
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:33.200]  friends let's go ahead and go to this latest clip the politics has to change and the people who are
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:39.920]  troubled by this have to be as intense and as organized and as adamant tell us about this
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:48.160]  issue as folks on the other side who are absolutists and think that any gun safety measures are
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:54.320]  somehow not getting our guns come back an assault on freedom or communistic or a plot by me to
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:25:05.680]  you know take over and stay in power for ever or something i mean they're all kinds of crap
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:09.360]  now the globalist saying power that float around there some of which by the way are
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:16.640]  ratified by elected officials in the other party on occasion um that really freaks you out doesn't
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:21.920]  it so we've got to change we've got to change the politics of this you know who he's addressing
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:26.560]  he's talking about us there not just and dutch because i get a lot of letters after this happens
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:34.160]  do something well okay here's what we here's what you need to do you have to make sure that it that
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:40.640]  anybody who you are voting for you have to hire enough illegal aliens bring them in they're not
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:45.120]  going to vote that's what they're doing for a couple of election cycles you got to vote against
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:51.120]  and let them know precisely why you're voting against them all right that's enough shut him off
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:58.080]  i've got to go to calls here they take these tragedies 167 people 166 it varies every year
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:05.520]  but that's the average 160 in the last decade every year 166 that die in mass shootings and they
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:09.360]  act like it's the end of the world and they show each person that died and personalize them which
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:16.000]  is fine if you did that for the 300 000 people al-qaeda killed in syria that you sent in there
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.840]  you more than anybody obama as the big front man leading america against the evil Assad who didn't
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:28.080]  do anything and then the 50 plus million babies and the just the vets not being given treatment
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:32.800]  by the tens of thousands dying and then you sit there and shake some dead people killed by some
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:40.160]  biracial socialist gun hating christian hating scumbag probably did it to get guns banned
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:47.680]  and probably wound up by some psychiatrist and you tell me collectively and our listeners
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:51.920]  that we're to blame because we believe there's a takeover plight look at this headline right
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.960]  here out of Breitbart and then my crew didn't just believe this okay they went to the attorney
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:01.440]  general loretta e lynch announces the launch of strong cities network in the united nations
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:08.720]  general assembly we have the remarks right here what she says they announced a un police force
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:14.320]  to fight extremism in the u.s and then they quote reports that say veterans and gun owners
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:17.760]  are the number one enemy when you dig in deeper
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:24.560]  oh there's no communistic plot there's nothing happening there's no problem none of this is
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:29.120]  going on you're right it's a globalist fascist plot uses a lot of communist techniques but it's not
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:35.360]  communist and they hate the fact that we see who they are they hate the fact they can't mesmerize
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:41.760]  us anymore and we know you're a bunch of crooks two plus two equals four man i did build my business
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:47.040]  you are someone that hates the bitter clingers that cling to their guns their bibles
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:53.040]  you have come to radically transform this america you have come to screw everybody over
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:58.240]  you got the republicans basically giving you the orders how to do it the neocons and we're sick
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:04.400]  of it we're tired of it and the numbers show the american people are sick of it let's go to raptor
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:10.160]  man thanks for holding her on the air raptor man from new york hey alex are you doing i'm okay
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:15.920]  watching that clips really creepy though i know i got three points to make about what you were
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:21.680]  saying earlier about the globalists uh long-term plan uh once pretty funny actually uh you go to
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:27.840]  nelson rocketfeller wikipedia scroll down a little bit there's a nice picture of him with a poster
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:36.400]  of obama care in 1954 so i'll probably take that off there really what does it say it's a poster of
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:41.760]  nelson rocketfeller standing there with obama care the exact obama care plan go to wikipedia
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:46.160]  nelson rockfeller oh of course i've scroll down yeah we've got it on screen you're saying basically
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:52.720]  the same system oh yeah they've always wanted it in 1954 so it's a long-term plan also i got two
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:58.960]  other points the awesome research i was doing you know i was watching a louis roush pack video
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:04.640]  about energy box density it's basically amount of energy they're going to give us and you know in
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:08.080]  the future the projections yeah that's a jen i'm going to hold you over i'm not going i'm not i'm
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:12.320]  not going to cut you short i'm going to hold you over but yes a jen 21 is an even older plan
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:17.200]  by the club of realm to restrict energy to make you go bankrupt and make you go on welfare so they
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:22.960]  can control you go ahead yeah yeah so even if they ramp up the energy production now like
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:28.160]  a Manhattan project to ramp up energy it still not could be enough to support the billions of
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:32.720]  people in the future that's right they've already sabotaged stay there you're so smart and i didn't
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:36.480]  know louis pack expose that but they're they're very on target with their analysis i don't agree
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:40.800]  with some of their in-game stuff but their analysis is spot on i mean i'm aware they're
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:44.880]  exposing eugenics but i'd like to hear what they said when we come back and then we'll go to chase

[01:29:53.600 --> 01:30:03.520]  gcn radio network kit annals info wars dot com president obama implied that the federal government
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:07.840]  should confiscate all guns that's right the president responsible for the deaths of women
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:12.160]  and children via drone strikes is now trying to eradicate second amendment when obama responded
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:16.880]  to the october first attack on an organ community college he went beyond his usual demand for more
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:21.280]  gun control and suggested that america should consider outright banning guns just like australia
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:25.760]  in great britain but it's hypocritical for obama's demand that americans turn in their guns when
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:30.160]  according to the pentagon the obama administration is backing isis in its war against the syrian
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:35.680]  government in fact in september 2013 president obama waived a federal law specifically designed to
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:40.320]  keep the u.s government from supplying firearms and terrorist groups such as isis on the very same
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:45.280]  day he demanded more gun control in response to the dc navy yard shooting in other words obama is
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:50.960]  shipping guns islamic militants aka moderate rebels while simultaneously trying to disarm american

[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:57.360]  discussion on political correctness and more well we're certainly on the highway to the danger zone
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:04.240]  right now with the saudis and i'm beginning to have to take more calls escalating and saying
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:14.640]  they may go toe to toe with the russians in a proxy war in syria and basically what putin's
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:20.320]  trying to do is maintain russian interests that they're not on an offense they're on the defense
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:28.000]  but now they're offensively on the defense and what they're trying to do is draw attention
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.920]  politically to who the west is backing and force the west to openly back the main rebels which are
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:38.320]  al qaeda they've been backing them they're just forcing a debate about that and now that debate's
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:44.160]  happening not just within the us military like it was four years ago three years ago two years ago
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:49.360]  not just ran paul coming out and saying we're not al qaeda's air force but now it's a global debate
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:56.320]  and it's really exposing how radical islam is being directed by western powers via saudi arabia
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:01.200]  and they're being forced to say well we want to do this to bring down iran
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:06.560]  so to bring down iran you're going to bring down syria and put al qaeda in charge that's not a very
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:14.640]  good idea i mean i wouldn't cry if they opened up iran and the mulas weren't in power and iran
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:19.920]  could industrialize and be free and they didn't have thought police on streets but it's not our
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:27.360]  country to run in 1953 a pro america president was overthrown by the cia and operation ajax
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:34.560]  mohammed mozadek and you know how they did it they blew up mosque and they blamed it on mohammed
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:40.320]  mozadek who was secular and they had the jihadis overthrow the government and they had the military
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:47.040]  remove them they could be rolled up quickly and they put the shaw in and the shaw didn't play ball
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:53.440]  so they gave him a fast acting cancer killed him in two weeks and brought in the eye total
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:58.880]  committee our government with the british and the french put the mulas in iran
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:05.360]  then we had a deal with them to do the grabbing on the hostages to make jimmy carter look bad
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:11.920]  then iran contra that was all done behind the scenes you want to say anything ronald regan
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:20.800]  did was bad it was it was that he knew about that he knew about iran contra the day the day
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:26.320]  before he came into office they started releasing the people oh he was they were scared of regan
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:31.360]  they were scared he was going to do something no it was a setup folks iran contra toe missiles and
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:37.920]  a bunch of other high tech weapons and agreement to leave iran alone if they did all that but wait
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:45.200]  it gets worse and i'll go to your cults then they tell saddam hussein two years later go ahead
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:49.600]  and launch an attack now on these oil fields and take them we're gonna be the satellites we're
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:53.840]  gonna be the nerve gas we're gonna be all the imaging you need everything else and then they
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:37:00.720]  set saddam up in 1990 tell him go ahead and invade kuey yeah you're right they're they're slant
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:04.720]  drilling you're our ally we're not going to get involved in inner arab affairs you've got the green
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:11.680]  light april gillespie told him he invaded two weeks later just setting all these countries up
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:19.520]  bringing them down it's evil america shouldn't be doing it and now people know about it raptor man
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:23.920]  thank you for holding them to get to everybody now i'm done i'm just was wound up from the weekend
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:29.040]  raptor man go ahead you were making some great points start back over yeah that's all right alex
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:35.040]  yeah that picture delson rockefeller with pd with the obama care plan uh it'd be interesting
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:41.040]  if i'll change that now or not if enough of your listeners look at it absolutely but yeah
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:47.440]  but you know my point about the energy flux density projections is the fact that they need to
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:52.320]  increase the energy production before the population comes and they're already lowering
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:57.440]  energy production so even if they start now uh they still won't be enough to support the people
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:01.040]  that are projected to be on there they're not planning on having that many people like as you
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:06.560]  say it's a long-term plan oh i've seen the u.n projections the club of rome it's admitted that
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:12.160]  populations going up supposed to peak at nine billion while energy is going down it's meant
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:16.240]  to artificially cut it off but the problem is we've got enough coal for thousands of years
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:23.920]  we can burn it clean so they've got to turn coal off worldwide exactly exactly you know it dovetails
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:28.160]  exactly what i was doing some casual research i was reading harvey dunne's book there and he says
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:33.120]  that it's going to be a massive wealth transfer in the next uh ten years from baby boomer to the
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:38.640]  next generation and for agenda 21's sake it occurred to me that that wealth transfer cannot
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:43.360]  take place i mean what you're seeing now with the stock market's going down he says you know it's
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:47.600]  going to go down to six thousand eight thousand i mean they cannot allow that transfer to happen
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:51.520]  except for to them they got to take their cut but the younger generation will not get that
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:57.040]  wealth transfer and that's why they're teaching the younger generation not to care about wealth
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:03.760]  or stability or security but to care about cultural things being obsessed with how you speak what you
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:11.840]  do they're turning the younger generations into literal cult members who run around enforcing
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:16.960]  on each other and showing who's more politically correct and they have nothing they're totally
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:23.120]  destitute they're totally unhappy they're unfulfilled so they keep doubling and tripling and quadrupling
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:29.520]  down on whatever the daily show says whatever the trendy say whatever the university says
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:34.480]  and they're in a total prison uh it's just so sad to see these useful idiots god bless you
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:42.880]  chase in colorado thanks for holding her on the air hey um i just wanted to say i've uh
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:48.800]  i'm 18 i've supported info wars since i was 11 and um yeah and about the second amendment
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:57.040]  um teachers you know i mean just because um just because shootings mass shootings seem
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:03.360]  to be going up doesn't mean that um the second amendment gets taken away that's the most backwards
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:08.240]  thing i've ever heard but they're not going up you you know the la time saying mass shootings
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:15.040]  down perception is they're up yeah exactly and um when stuff really goes down school teachers are
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:20.320]  going to be like some of the first people to be drug out of the city and shot well that's exactly
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:24.720]  what they were saying at the organ shooting was that it was a death trap and everyone was just
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:29.760]  told to grovel and men with guns uh weren't allowed in from outside who wanted to protect people
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:34.720]  it's just this culture of stand down do nothing get in a fetal position no getting in a fetal
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:43.120]  position is how you die right right and um yeah exactly that's well god bless you i appreciate

[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:56.800]  year yes hi alex welcome guys letting you know about a little other piece of propaganda speaking of
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:04.400]  the un then the in the sheep and the sheepets as i call them um there is a new youtube video
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:11.600]  fairly new couple weeks um and i'm disgusted that they even use the term we the people but there's
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:20.640]  a new video that's we the people for the global goals and it is you know they've got all the stars
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:26.880]  and starlets out there pushing you know oh we're not going to ever you know people will no longer
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:33.280]  be in poverty nobody's ever going to be hungry again i know i saw the video a few weeks ago
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:37.600]  in fact i meant to play it and and and we've got this meeting coming up in paris to get it all done
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:42.240]  everything's going to be free now oh but five years ago we got the treaty the last time it
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:46.160]  basically doubles the taxes on the third world the carbon taxes they promised the third world
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:51.440]  we're going to tax the wealthy and give you freebies just do what we say just support this
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:42:00.240]  everything's going to be free just take the shot we love you we love you we love you oh we love you
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:06.000]  yeah i'd love to see your crew break that down because it it's pretty disgusting how they're just
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.560]  pushing all this stuff and not a bit of it's going to be true so yeah no it's sustainable
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:15.840]  development which is the global carbon tax i've seen the video we've got it on screen and i do
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:19.680]  want to do an analysis of the propaganda in fact one big thing i've dropped the ball on and also
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:23.920]  some of the other crew has i mean they're doing a great job we just need to focus on propaganda
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:30.640]  cartoons propaganda pieces propaganda trailers put out by different institutions to then analyze
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:39.840]  uh the pieces under fair use and break them down uh and just fact check them at every level uh that
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:46.960]  this global goals from the un is a death sentence for a billion people anything else fabian uh well
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:52.400]  yeah i'll reiterate i i called in about a week ago to tell you about the propaganda piece that
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:43:00.160]  uh nbc news did live there with the the pregnant migrant collapse right at his feet while he was
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:07.520]  richard engel i did see that and i don't know if we did a blurb on that what was the headline on
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:14.000]  the video again the the video is out there but it's like richard engel drops what he's doing to
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:20.320]  help collapse woman i i saw the video just totally ridiculous just like the pope kid was fake all of
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:26.160]  it's completely fake richard engel shows his humanity when pregnant refugee collapses on
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:34.400]  ms on nbc oh that's the huffington post oh that's george soros he loves you he wants to help you
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:40.320]  see how how fake it is um well i guess when you've got the glasses on you can but uh
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:46.160]  but anyway yeah it was just big fake uh business right right there in in your face just to try to
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:51.040]  pull america's heartstrings and well i mean seeing in reduced the size of his nose his lips and made
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:56.000]  him white when they turned the mixed race shooter into a white man and said he was a white supremacist
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:01.280]  i mean this is what they do they prey on us they love it and and they've gotten to a point now
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:05.680]  where they legalized domestic propaganda last year now obama signed an executive order two weeks ago
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:11.840]  to engage in psyops directly against us using the pentagon i mean they are taking the gloves off
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:18.480]  folks god bless you i appreciate your call fabian and to those of us aware of all this
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:27.680]  it seems ridiculous and you know cnn is comedy ms nbc is comedy you got to understand maybe 30 40
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:33.280]  percent of the public cannot tie their shoelaces or find their butt with both hands i'm serious
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:39.440]  and another 20 or so percent know it's all a fraud this is the best numbers i can come up with
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:46.320]  is a dead reckoning maybe 20 25 percent maybe 30 it's probably 25 percent are sociopathic now
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:52.720]  and know it's evil and know it's a fraud and have chosen to just get on the bandwagon because they
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:45:00.400]  think they're on the winning team and i really figured this out that's the group we ought to
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:05.760]  be targeting explaining to them you're not going to get any power out of this you're not going to
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:13.040]  save yourself you're not going to even midterm produce a good world with what you're doing for
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:18.720]  yourself do you understand screwing other people over will end up coming back on everybody the
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:25.520]  problem is those type of people though just enjoy cheating and being deceptive and screwing folks
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:36.320]  over so even if it destroys them they won't listen so maybe i'm wrong but then you got about
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:40.240]  30 40 percent that are really awake and know what's going on
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:47.280]  but they feel disempowered and don't know what to do because it's such a big problem
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:53.360]  the biggest thing i would do is don't even argue the merits with these people with their
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:58.160]  fake debates go to the beginning of it and point out how it's all a set staged agenda
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:03.680]  to enslave us and dehumanize us and every time they're pushing some agenda it's not even what
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:09.440]  they say it is it's a total false reality these people don't know what they're talking about
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:17.040]  they're pseudo-intellectuals so they just repeat talking points at us because they have nothing
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:22.960]  they're chumps they're idiots they're totally in the hands of incredibly wicked people
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:29.520]  they've bought into a lie and they can't admit it i can't tell you how many people
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:34.320]  have come to me over the years with the nigerian scams and other scams and they've said you need
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:38.560]  to invest in nigeria you need to invest with this prince you need to we're all going to get a ton
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:47.840]  of money when we do this and they get mad when i tell them it's a fraud and then they even invest
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:53.200]  in the fraud and then down the road will never speak to me again i've had this happen with
[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:58.800]  four different people and they hate me when i've one person really looks like they hate me when i
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:04.960]  see them because they can't admit they got screwed over they didn't learn from it they just
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:08.960]  just thought i was trying to keep them from being successful
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.680]  and that's what these obama supporters are they just get into it they just feel like
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:20.240]  it's their family it's their club they're cool nobody can stop them and they're part of the
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:25.600]  winning team whoo yeah you know ut longhorns it's the same thing it's like you're part of
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:28.080]  some club but you're not in the club
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:34.480]  and twan in california thanks for holding you're on the air
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:45.280]  hi alex welcome uh i wanted to get your opinion and uh shout out to your products i um i'm on
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:52.160]  the liver shield now i just got to knock out and i have some product reviews on the orbiter youtube
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:56.640]  but i wanted to get your opinion on donald trump if any of his staff are listening now i'd like to
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:02.560]  say ben carson rand paul or tay cruz who should be his vice president thank you thank you god
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:10.320]  bless you that's a great question i would support trump more if he put a rand paul in i really like
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:18.880]  carson but carson is so good i can tell he's really a good man he's so good that he really
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:25.040]  believes the state wants to help you and is for force inoculations he just is naive he's super
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:30.800]  smart but he's i know people like this he just is so good he wants to help people so much
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:38.080]  that he just can't believe the system's corrupt or bad and i know a lot of seventh-day adventists
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:42.320]  they're really smart loving hardworking people on average some of the most successful people
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:47.120]  i know are seventh-day adventists but they still will do whatever the government tells them
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:51.920]  you know a lot of seventh-day adventists were chemically and biologically tested on
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:59.200]  and radiologically tested on they volunteered for it including in some cases to be killed basically
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:06.000]  because they thought that was christlike i mean i grew up about my mom worked for some of the most
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:12.880]  prominent seventh-day adventists in the country growing up in dallas in pr she wasn't a seventh-day
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:18.800]  adventist but they had a national tv show and they were really nice people but man i tell you
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:23.360]  i mean nixon used to call up when she was in the office she wasn't usually the secretary but sometimes
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:27.360]  she'd answer the phone the secretary was out maybe the president nixon's on the line was like
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:33.360]  so the seventh-day evidence are pretty high-powered uh but it's just that
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:40.560]  that's my issue with carson i'm not bashing seventh-day adventists i'm just saying
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:48.080]  he's too totalitarian and he likes low taxes christian values i really like all that but you
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:53.760]  can go too extreme the other way if you then just start saying the state's perfect who'd he say he
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:50:05.680]  said uh rand paul ted cruise or uh carson i like cruise i really do like cruise i mean he's got some
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:10.480]  better leadership qualities than rand paul but i've got to say of the three i like rand paul the
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:15.440]  best but i guess you were asking collars what do they think about that i think that's a good question
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:20.160]  if you want to just throw that in but i would trust trump a lot more if he had a vice president
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:32.240]  who was somebody like paul or cruise but i would take carson i mean i think carson is a good man
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:38.800]  he can be educated he's gone on a power trip uh you can really tell he's a humble man i have a
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:42.560]  good feeling about carson and i just have to be honest with people that i really don't like some
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:48.480]  of the stuff he stands for but i have a good feeling about but if he's naive he can be manipulated
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:52.560]  ted cruise i really like how he talks now he acts but i got this gut feeling that
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:57.360]  he's a little too slick rand paul loving i'm afraid he listens too much to his advisors
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:02.880]  i mean there's there's where i stand hi this is wall august cinowitz i'm the founder and

[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:50.560]  psychology department about all the weirdnesses and how people have a right to it and how we
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:54.080]  should pay for it I mean this is just what goes on in America and worldwide now
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:58.320]  because it's an enemy takeover
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:03.680]  Georgia and Connecticut on the TPP go ahead sir welcome
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:10.400]  yeah I think we should line up a lot of good speakers on that and see if we can get everybody
[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:16.400]  to constantly bombard their legislatures and uh senators and congressmen to to stop this in the
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:21.360]  track make them realize that we don't want this unless there's a referendum where the people
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:26.960]  can actually vote on this to get about the the the trader politicians who vote everything
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:31.680]  against the the people's will that's right they've never voted down a trade authority ever and so
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:35.760]  what they had the president was fast tracked but they said don't worry we'll now review it but they
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:41.520]  still can't see it other than senior members for one hour in a locked room with no photography
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:47.680]  I mean this this is this is crazy the type of people we should be lining up is Pat Buchanan
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:56.800]  nader because I just saw him up in a at uh sell uh what is it uh uh your your economic guy uh
[02:02:56.800 --> 02:03:01.920]  cilente get a peace demonstration up there he's against this he has a big website on that
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:06.960]  virtually left to what right the people if you line these people that's right left to right it
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:12.560]  is it is the most unpopular issue it's like 80 some percent of americans 89 percent don't like it
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:18.080]  so it's all secret because it's illegal it's secret it's pure bull it's unconstitutional
[02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:22.960]  so the government's almost unanimous because we're almost unanimous against it it's called a
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:30.320]  power grab it's called a takeover it's called epic I mean it just shows how flamingly authoritarian
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:37.040]  these scumbags are I think we should uh make it clear that we're going to call uh we're going to
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:42.640]  pass legislative laws in the states to call them out and and make them treasonous and basically
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:47.280]  jail these son of a bitch is that they keep passing uh passing these type of laws that are
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:51.840]  totally against the people's will yeah I think that's what we call this piece jail the tpp sons
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:57.600]  of bitches but you know I want to be honest you know that's insulting women who had kids on a wedlock
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:00.240]  I don't think that's that you know I'm not I'm saying it's a great thing but you know
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:09.200]  these guys are beyond bastard sons of bitches right right I mean we we lose terminology for
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:13.680]  these type of people I mean the beyond the beyond the scope of of the imagination even of our
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:20.400]  ancestors they are so traitorous because we produce so much wealth the world's so complex
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:26.240]  criminals can hide in the complexity but now the crime has gotten so big there's this complexity
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:30.960]  sitting in front of it but the crime's 20 times bigger so the complexity doesn't hide it anymore
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:36.480]  we're just looking at it and it's gotten so arrogant so crazy so wild you know I mean like I said
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:41.680]  earlier Pepsi has baby flavoring bodies part sales they're keeping prisoners alive and harvesting
[02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:46.320]  their organs piece by piece in China uh you know they're trying to teach our five-year-olds on a
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:52.080]  masturbate in school I mean it's just like stop it stop it you crazy people pouring bleach in
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:57.280]  their eyes on television how wonderful it all is I mean it's just crazy we'll be back stay with us
[02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:05.120]  Kit Daniels infoworse.com CNN reportedly altered the photo of the biracial organ shooter to make
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:09.600]  him look more white now that's a shocking revelation so let me repeat that CNN apparently
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:13.840]  doctored the photo of the biracial organ shooter Christopher Mercer to make people think he's
[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:19.040]  Caucasian Mercer uploaded a selfie to social media but when CNN used the photo in its news
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:24.560]  broadcast Mercer's skin tone had dramatically changed that of a white man furthermore CNN did
[02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:29.600]  not show photos of Mercer's mother who was African-American and the network also didn't report that
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:33.760]  Mercer was involved in the school play which contradicts the media's claim that he was a loner
[02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:38.320]  why would they do that because a biracial organ shooter does not fit into the establishment's
[02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:42.640]  propaganda that mass shooters are white racist men they also don't want you to know that Mercer
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:47.360]  was associated with the black lives matter movement because it would be a political nightmare for Obama
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:51.520]  if the public knew the truth it'd be hard for him to demand more gun control if more people
[02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:55.920]  started to realize that President Obama is fueling racial division across the US once again this is

[02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:14.800]  shield nason iodine x2 it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over 100 years
[02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:19.680]  the federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine a crude form of it
[02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:24.800]  be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency and iodine

[02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:35.920]  it took me by surprise i knew that you felt it too
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:39.040]  by the look you go
[02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:51.680]  well here's the headline ladies and gentlemen as we enter the third hour
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:58.080]  the elder fourth considered staging a fake hijacking after 9 11 i want to get into the
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:09:06.240]  story because it ties into a lot of other issues and then i'm going to get back into the tpp being
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:11.840]  agreed to in secret by major corporations and governments but still the american people and
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:18.320]  other nations populations are not allowed to see the secret global treaties that are not trade deals
[02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:26.480]  that are global government so that's all coming up but first off delta force considered staging
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:34.640]  fake hijacking after 9 11 now why is this so important even though we're 14 years after 9 11
[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:40.720]  you can go pull up my films road to tyranny masters of terror and such and you can see all the news
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:46.160]  articles and video clips from mainstream news even in those films and you can even search the web
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:55.360]  and go to the google archive and find abc news usa today and even cnn admitting
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:01.760]  that the pentagon staged dozens of drills the cia multiple drills
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:14.480]  where hijackers tried to hijack american and united aircraft in the two years before 9 11
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:23.760]  insimulated drills now that's a big deal because on the morning of 9 11 they were running drills
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:29.440]  of hijackers trying to take over aircraft but the specific details of that remain classified
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:36.560]  that's even in the new york times and we know that mohammed adda and the other supposed 19
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:45.440]  hijackers 15 of them that came from saudi arabia we know that those very individuals were at the
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:50.000]  defense language school kernel butler the head of the school and public and said i don't know
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:54.320]  what's going on but three of these guys were trained here one of them was in my class just a
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:58.880]  few years ago something's happening we know they had passports and they were allowed to travel in
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:02.960]  and out of the country i've had the former head of the visa section from jeta saudi arabia on
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:07.040]  springman they were ordered to let these guys into the country even though they were flagged as
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:12.800]  terrorists and were told they're working with the cia so you leap forward to christmas a few
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:21.680]  years ago what four or five years ago with the underwear bomber mutalib his dad's this top ambassador
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:26.640]  he is clearly drugged on the plane witnesses see it someone from the u.s government in amsterdam
[02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:31.440]  orders them to let him on the plane he then stands up a man gets up and starts videotaping
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:36.160]  it's all staged a firecracker goes off in his pants they then use that as a way to bring in
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:40.320]  the naked body scanners and more security against the american people themselves
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:48.560]  well now we have the new york post delta force considered staging fake hijacking
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:56.720]  after 9 11 as a false flag to tell the public delta force was on all the planes as pure security
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:05.200]  theater does admit it now to scare people from ever hijacking planes now that's the cover story
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:12.240]  because i know this is coming out no it was going to be done so they could sell more security and
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:18.800]  put real military on all the aircraft and get the army involved not just the air marshals
[02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:27.040]  and i know about this because i was told this by someone in the federal government back in 2003
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:36.640]  now let's go further delta force and i'll never forget esquire was here i don't know like two
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:43.600]  years ago doing a cover story you can go read it and this guy's dad was the cia section chief
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:49.120]  he's the top profiler in the country he shows up he goes i agree with some of what you say but not a
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:53.920]  lot of it and i'm gonna prove you're wrong on this stuff he goes there was no delta force running
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:59.360]  the the seattle thing i was there they didn't stage the riots and i went here's four newspapers
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:04.800]  seattle post intelligents or seattle times and two others all admitting and he went oh my god i
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:08.880]  was there and didn't know this i go here's the police chief came on my show and talked about it
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:13.200]  here's a film i made and he went oh my god i can't believe this is true then he started checking
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:20.000]  everything i was saying and found out basically it was all true it was going to be probably a cover
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:25.040]  story he goes they're not even going to publish it now maybe i mean because i'm not attacking you
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:29.840]  basically enough but he was so prestigious he does all the tom cruise interviews all of them
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:39.040]  that basically they published the article they published the article but i got a call from esquire
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:42.640]  they said look we want you to do one of those wild man poses you do because we need to balance this
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:47.680]  out this is too at least they were honest when the photographer came i said okay i'll do a monster face
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:52.720]  for you and you call that selling out it's not i played ball because it's a waste i've had him not
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:58.320]  do other big stories and i knew that just bring people into the show anyways so i you know did a
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:05.600]  you know war growl face i mean i really do that anyway so why not do it it's an aspect of who i am
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:13.520]  and they stuck it at the very back of the magazine the very back of the magazine
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:21.920]  but that guy had enough power to where he could basically threaten to get really upset and talk
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:28.000]  about if they didn't put it in there when it was the wall street journal or the new york times
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:32.160]  or the washington post you know what happens when they want to do a profile now or atlantic
[02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:38.800]  monthly i go you won't be allowed to publish your piece if it's not a complete deceptive piece of
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:47.040]  garbage and they come here they do the piece and they go oh my gosh in my 10 years my 30 years my
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:54.400]  40 years i've never seen them do this on a story they're not going to publish it they shot a five
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:15:00.640]  part series the highest budget ever for discovery channel that i was in i spent months in like 2006
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:07.760]  shooting it with the was sitting belger belger guys he's one like you know top awards made
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:12.480]  brothers keeper all that some kind of monster with metallica he's been on the show really nice guy
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:16.720]  he didn't make me look like a cook i mean there was some stuff where i was goofy i am goofy
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:22.560]  they he came to me and he said will you be willing to let some fox news people
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:26.880]  reshoot some of this because what foxes wasn't involved that's what they wanted to counter me
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:32.640]  and and to battle some pundits to add to this and i said because they say it's too one sided and i
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:36.960]  said sure he comes back a week later he goes you know what i have integrity i'm not doing it
[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:44.240]  and so the whole piece was shelved and they killed it because he wouldn't re-edit it
[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:52.880]  and turn it into a fraud so if people want to know about control out there they sent
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:58.160]  homeland security that i'm not even supposed to get into this because i was told all of this
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:03.200]  in confidence but i don't think it's really right that people don't know about this let me tell you
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:08.880]  this there was a lot more went on to kill jesse ventura's fema show that i basically wrote
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:15.680]  and that that one piece that was like 80 ounce jumps they aired one time folks
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:18.800]  those congressional hearings on everything because it was so accurate
[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:24.400]  it was a lot of stuff from behind the scenes people don't even know about let me tell you this
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:30.720]  government wants to take over it wants to shut this show down it wants to arrest people it's evil
[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:36.880]  and so that's the rest of the story on all of this
[02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:45.680]  and this is now leaking about the delta force doing all this the rest of the story about seattle
[02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:53.280]  i've gone up against navy seals and delta force and i didn't know what was going on when this was
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:17:02.160]  all first happening setting fires and trying to blame me taking our video at gunpoint uh
[02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:07.760]  i mean in the old days under clinton folks if i tried to go to an urban warfare drill in a major
[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:15.360]  city and try to cover it they'd break in our hotel rooms they'd sabotage our cars uh they would uh
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:20.800]  they put something in my drink gave me a migraine headache for 12 hours
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:28.400]  and it was just funny to them and you people like oh the navy seals are wonderful the delta
[02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:33.120]  force are great there are a lot of great people in there but i'm telling you the ones that work
[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:38.640]  directly under the president whatever they call them squadrons that folks they're involved in
[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:44.640]  murdering people domestically shipping drugs in renditions i mean they take some of the best
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:49.040]  people in the country and they just test them and test them until they'll do anything and they put
[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:53.440]  them on drugs they put them on steroids they put them on growth hormone they put them on all sorts
[02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:58.560]  of weird stuff and they just completely whack them out of their minds and i wouldn't be surprised
[02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:04.240]  is this being put out because they were going to set delta force up or something and have them
[02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:08.800]  do some hijackings i mean even at the end of one day in september they got an academy award
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:16.560]  that came out like in 2003 about the munich situation with the munich olympic games back in
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:23.040]  the 70s they admit that at just at the end that oh the german staged a hijacking to release the
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:27.120]  the terrorist because it turned out they've been working for them the whole time that whole thing
[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:31.680]  was staged at the munich olympics and they just admit at the end of it it's all fake
[02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:41.600]  but they did something else now in the last five years with is which was the payoff to
[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:48.240]  saudi arabia who from 1901 to 1933 was given the entire middle east from nothing by british

[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:42.640]  illness and saying you've got to accept it and maybe your eyes should be gouged out so should I do a

[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:11.440]  good job here on the ring of dings today let's go to Christopher in North Dakota you're on the
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:18.160]  year worldwide hey Alex thanks for for everything you do thank you can I ask you a question sir do
[02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:23.920]  you have eyes yeah well that's a little hurtful like if you don't have a mother or father we
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:28.160]  should ban that word are you considering burning your eyeballs out so you'll be more like blind
[02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:36.240]  people uh man you know I've thought about it but I like to be able to see in the god the gifts that
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:42.880]  god has blessed me with but they say in the new liberal movement eyes are a sin two plus two equals
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:48.080]  five you didn't build your business don't you see the beauty of our new leader the king lord who
[02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:53.760]  doesn't want us to have sight it's so liberal yeah yeah he's trying to keep you blind that's for sure
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:59.840]  join us gouge your eyeballs out it's liberal we're not a sick cult of freaks poor drain oh and your
[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:03.920]  eyes I'm sorry go ahead I was just channeling them for a moment go ahead I'm sorry Christopher
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:10.080]  hey no worries um so I just have a point and a couple of fact points to help base it um but
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:16.560]  you know with this gun control they're calling for um let's take it back down to the public schools
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:20.960]  which were our government is teaching our you mean the government training centers
[02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:26.000]  yes exactly the ones that say the kids belong to them what about those wonderful places
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:34.240]  so if your child skipped school or misses too much school who is the one is uh that's called
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:40.800]  to court and made to pay the fines and possibly sentenced to jail mommy and daddy skipping school
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:49.600]  that is correct so when it comes all down to it um you parent if your child has gone out and
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:56.560]  committed a mass murder then basically your parent has failed to teach your child humanity
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:01.680]  respect for all forms of life you know but the government will not allow you to discipline
[02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:06.160]  your child and if you try to take your child to get a second opinion for their health they're
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:11.920]  going to send cps to come get them uh yeah this is another guy that lived in his mother's basement
[02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:17.760]  with the Oregon shooting who hated christians who was biracial have you seen the photo that
[02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:24.640]  i'll see you in uh made his nose lips smaller and then turning white oh yes i've seen that picture
[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:30.960]  i mean this just shows the sickening level of deception with these people yeah yeah and if your
[02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:37.520]  child has one little flaw they're going to push government made methamphetamine on them if your
[02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:42.560]  child is on ateril or aterol have we want to pronounce it you better look at the ingredient
[02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:48.240]  labeled because 99 percent of it is methamphetamine salt well your kid exactly your kids are going
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:52.800]  to be bouncing off the walls the first month but then they are going to get calm when they burn out
[02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:58.240]  and their brain mass shrinks and rotholes form in the brain they've got all these adults you name it
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:02.320]  i think every maid service i've run into i look in their eyes their faces they're all on speed
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:06.800]  i feel sorry for these people because they're going to end up burning out slower than they
[02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:11.360]  would if it was street meth but absolutely they only bust the meth labs because it's not government
[02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:18.800]  run or big pharma run uh i mean something like 25 percent of kids mainly boys are on speed now
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:24.880]  and this is absolutely screwing these kids over you know these parents are wondering what's going
[02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:29.680]  on with their children they need to read the ingredients that these this big pharma is pushing
[02:28:29.680 --> 02:28:34.560]  on their kids more than that if they eat the red dyes the sugars i mean i'll break down sometimes
[02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:38.880]  and give my kids some crap sugar and then their demons i mean as long as i don't give them processed
[02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:43.840]  dyes and sugars and additives they're fine i mean of course they act crazy if i fed my dog
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:49.600]  some of these candies it would go crazy well thank you very much for your time i know you're on a
[02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:53.840]  tight show and uh thanks for everything that you're bringing up and no don't thank me we are all in
[02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:57.840]  this together god bless you brother there goes christopher i'm not going to go to calls yet because
[02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:02.800]  i don't want to cut you down to a minute cori and rex and uh mathu and d and others and when
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:06.880]  i'm done with those calls i'm going to shift gears into the news and the clips i haven't hit yet
[02:29:06.880 --> 02:29:13.120]  so what i call a news blitz that i hardly ever get to will be coming up about bernack he says slow
[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:18.080]  growth is weighing on us economy that's a huge admission cnbc said that today
[02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:24.800]  he was on cnbc you mean we're not in the greatest economy ever i thought everything was wonderful
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:29.760]  so we've been telling this for a while but there is the admission that ties into job creation
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:34.720]  misses big in september but then they go on to ask but really what is the job situation because
[02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:40.080]  they admit those numbers are even faked even mainstream news cnbc admits it's fake numbers
[02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:46.160]  but the fake numbers are bad and then they spin it like we'll just have confidence it'll fix it no
[02:29:46.160 --> 02:29:54.160]  turn the power plants back on that's a good start cheap energy all starts there alex jones and the gcn
[02:29:54.160 --> 02:30:03.440]  radio network kit daniels info wars dot com president obama implied that the federal government
[02:30:03.440 --> 02:30:07.760]  should confiscate all guns that's right the president responsible for the deaths of women
[02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:12.160]  and children via drone strikes is now trying to eradicate second amendment when obama responded to
[02:30:12.160 --> 02:30:16.800]  the october first attack on an organ community college he went beyond his usual demand for more
[02:30:16.800 --> 02:30:21.200]  gun control and suggested that america should consider outright banning guns just like australia
[02:30:21.200 --> 02:30:25.280]  and great britain but it's hypocritical for obama to man that americans turn in their guns
[02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:29.520]  when according to the pentagon the obama administration is backing ice in its war against
[02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:35.040]  the syrian government in fact in september 2013 president obama waived a federal law specifically
[02:30:35.040 --> 02:30:39.600]  designed to keep the us government from supplying firearms to terrorist groups such as isis on the
[02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:44.400]  very same day he demanded more gun control in response to the dc navy yard shooting in other
[02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:49.920]  words obama is shipping guns to islamic militants aka moderate rebels while simultaneously trying
[02:30:49.920 --> 02:30:54.800]  to disarm american citizens once again this is kit daniels with info wars dot com and prison

[02:33:13.200 --> 02:33:21.040]  we now take you live to the central texas command center in the heart of the resistance it's alex
[02:33:21.040 --> 02:33:46.880]  jones
[02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:55.280]  welcome ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us we're pulling the trigger
[02:33:56.080 --> 02:34:00.320]  i'm trying to expose the globalist agenda worldwide and patriots from countries all
[02:34:00.320 --> 02:34:05.280]  across the planet male female it doesn't matter sorry i just heard people saying the word male
[02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:10.560]  and female that hurts folks that aren't see the mind control see how over the top this is see how
[02:34:10.560 --> 02:34:19.520]  these people mean business well we mean business all over the world exposing the globalist agenda
[02:34:19.520 --> 02:34:25.840]  and fighting it and as people begin to understand the logic of the new world order the twisted wicked
[02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:34.560]  demonic system that they're bringing forward people understand there's no making a deal with
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:41.280]  blsbub and they realize they're not part of the deal their schmucks their jokes their idiots
[02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:47.760]  their chumps their fools their suckers and as folks begin to realize this their understanding
[02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:54.400]  that they need to say no to the system because this system is the opposite of a cultural agreement
[02:34:54.400 --> 02:35:02.000]  or a cultural compact or a social contract this is a contract for global extermination
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:10.480]  and slowly turning the lights off slowly turning the infrastructure off slowly playing god
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:18.400]  god according to every ancient text basically every culture the ashtex the jews the babeloneans
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:23.360]  the the greeks have the flood mythology whether you believe it's real or not there have been a
[02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:29.040]  lot of big floods but a global flood mythology and god got angry and flooded the whole planet
[02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:35.520]  and there were these big glaciers and other things under the earth's crust and it opened
[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:42.080]  up the fountains of the deep and the ecology of the planet changed and it rained for 40 days
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:48.640]  and 40 nights well the new world order i guess is read that god's going to destroy the earth
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:57.520]  the next time by fire and roll up the heavens like a great scroll after the thousand year
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:06.320]  reign of valhalla here on elysium and so the story ends and we're transported on to the next realm
[02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:13.600]  it's a lot heavier than what you heard in the church as they don't want to actually read from
[02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:17.840]  the bible and tell you all that but let's just move on whether it's real or not let's just not
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:22.640]  have that debate god first came and destroyed us by water but the rainbow came and promised
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:27.600]  not by water next by fire well the globalists are killing us by genetic engineering they're
[02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:33.680]  killing us by new world order overwrite by infiltration by takeover basically it's like a slow motion
[02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:38.000]  john carpenter's 1982 remake of the thing
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:48.720]  but it's slow motion doesn't just take over in a day or a week or a month it takes over over decades
[02:36:48.720 --> 02:36:54.640]  and every life form has changed every atmosphere is manipulated every culture is brought down every
[02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:59.840]  family is broken up and the brains are slowly poisoned and slowly dumbed down where no one
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:05.040]  knows where it came from and you're in such a drugged induced haze such a chemical induced haze
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:11.680]  such a poisoned gmo haze such a glyphosate drunken state that you don't even know why you're dying
[02:37:11.680 --> 02:37:18.080]  you don't even care by the time it hits you because you already were soft killed metaphysical rule
[02:37:18.080 --> 02:37:24.800]  they've got to first have us physically rot and fall and rot our minds or they can't fully move
[02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:31.200]  against us until we've been debased and turned into animals and until as a group we call for humans
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:37.680]  to be destroyed we call for our system to be overwritten we call for a world without man we hate
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:45.440]  ourselves we kill our young we defile ourselves we we have taste testing systems made of dead
[02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:53.680]  baby parts you know pepsi we we just give in to all of this it's the metaphor from that pretty good
[02:37:55.600 --> 02:37:57.920]  movie with the black comedian eddie murphy
[02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:03.600]  i said black comedian eddie murphy is a trick for me to remember their name
[02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:08.720]  i'm stalling remember their name teleprompter free eddie murphy the golden child where the top
[02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:14.720]  demon has got to get the golden child to eat the poison of other dead kids the blood of other dead
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:21.040]  kids he's got to physically defile him so he can just get him ready to basically be starved to death
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:26.720]  and be so weak they're able to kill him with this particular dagger and that's a really good metaphor
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:32.080]  for how this works they got to poison all of us because we're all gods golden children they got
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:37.760]  to get us all ready and it's poisoned and it's soft killed and stumbling around before they come
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:46.000]  and hit us with the main salvo i mean the elite are all aware of this and they understand if they
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:50.560]  don't avoid the gmo if they don't avoid the florida they don't avoid it all then they're not enlightened
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:55.200]  ones and so they all have their special gardens their special drugs their clean vaccines it's all
[02:38:55.200 --> 02:39:01.040]  on record and they just religiously have their own food trucks their own jets their own everything
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:03.920]  and they all get in line and they're all aware of it we're talking maybe
[02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:10.720]  maybe six thousand seven thousand people on the planet in their own words are aware of this
[02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:15.280]  and they just totally try to just get ready and they're all very scared in the elite yes
[02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:18.480]  we're going to care at the plan it's better for the earth we've got to get everything
[02:39:18.480 --> 02:39:22.480]  deindustrialized and all the nation's ready to fall so they can't stand against the world government
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:26.640]  when it does the mopping up of the population in emergency surgery to save the earth the
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:32.560]  caring population is too big the planet's dying well then why are you gmoing and toxic waste dumping
[02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:37.040]  and doing everything you can to kill the earth while you claim you're going to block off the
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:42.640]  technologies to us and then wipe us out to save it the truth is you're greedily grabbing control
[02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:48.800]  and being promised all this power by your masters who are not going to give you the life extension
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:54.080]  when it gets down the deeper globalist statements and documents are they're not even going to keep
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:59.360]  a million people around they tell their acolytes their minions 100 million they're not going to
[02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:08.720]  keep a million around you idiots that the do you understand their nature is not going to change as
[02:40:08.720 --> 02:40:17.440]  they continue to power grab your complete idiots you're not part of the ruling elite you are not
[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:25.600]  going to be given eternal life by the system and i've talked to some of these people and they know
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:32.560]  that and they go i know what do you do because let me tell you these people start turning against
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:36.960]  their masters they get killed real quick see i've never joined these people i've never taken
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:42.000]  anything from them i spiritually have announced that i'm not part of them and that's why i'm someone
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:50.880]  hands off i have to be seduced in by all their subcorruptions before i can get to some level
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:57.840]  where i wake up and i'm in their hands but i'm aware of that but this is the master seduction
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:02.480]  of humanity that you're witnessing and if you believe the bible it's being run by an ancient
[02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:09.440]  powerful entity with super advanced intelligence that is feeding high tech technology to its
[02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:16.400]  internal priesthood to be developed tested and deployed now if you don't believe that how did
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:25.200]  people in 1854 1855 envision the double helix of dna envision genetic engineering envision
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:30.720]  the science of biometrics social engineering and the whole plan dropped to the brain of sir
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:39.280]  francis gallton charles darwin his cousin and others because you go back and study eugenics
[02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:48.720]  by the 1860s they had the whole plan atomic weapons everything already envisioned and these
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:53.840]  guys would just get up charles darwin wrote a book about this not his deal on the species but
[02:41:53.840 --> 02:41:56.560]  several other books i've read him you go look him up i forget the name of the one it was a short
[02:41:56.560 --> 02:42:01.040]  book about how he would just get up and have these hallucinations and then he would just go
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:04.080]  and be able to write all this stuff out the guy was possessed folks
[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:12.560]  galton did the same thing they would just envision all of this and then it worked 30 years later
[02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:21.120]  they've got ibm coming out with computers but of course to race study to study humans how to
[02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:29.920]  control humans so a lot of the elite believe they deserve all the power because they did
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:35.920]  hatch all of this and now they're building giant cyclotrons hadron collider and others and and and
[02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:42.560]  breaking dimensional gates and i don't know what's behind those dimensions this isn't hollywood
[02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:49.440]  but this is a lot more powerful than atomic and hydrogen bombs and they admit that so see they're
[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:54.080]  so enamored by the crystal ball of the knowledge of good of the knowledge of good and evil that they
[02:42:54.080 --> 02:43:01.120]  have that i sit there and watch people i was at a restaurant i'm gonna go to your calls having brunch
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:10.720]  yesterday for about two hours and i was watching people watch the nfl and i was watching them
[02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:15.440]  talk about it i mean these people weren't alive they weren't awake they didn't want to be alive
[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:23.520]  or awake and they thought the world was about nfl teams i mean can you imagine that we've got
[02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:34.960]  elites that 160 years ago we're envisioning the proto equations that 30 40 years ago 30 40 years
[02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:41.200]  later were translated into action then suppressed from the public for 40 plus years and then built
[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:52.240]  in secret 90 years after they had visions about it and then the british under the royalty you
[02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:58.400]  can look this up it's in their deeper annals began to breed these psychic families you know the
[02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:03.120]  orwells were on the side of these families they were partially married into them they began to
[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:09.680]  secretly marry all these families together these scientist families these occult families
[02:44:09.680 --> 02:44:22.400]  to then produce people like oldest huxley and julian huxley and oldest was the propagandus
[02:44:22.400 --> 02:44:28.000]  and julian was the guy actually putting the plan in worldwide for the first director general of
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:35.520]  yanesco and he wrote about all these plans in the 40s that we're now living exactly what he said
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:40.800]  but who cares about some guy that made our civilization as it is who cares about somebody
[02:44:40.800 --> 02:44:45.760]  that actually decided to put the cancer viruses in the vaccines who cares if his brother wrote in
[02:44:45.760 --> 02:44:52.400]  1932 about super advanced genetic engineering and all the discoveries and what would be done and
[02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:57.200]  then you read it and you go this isn't science fiction it isn't they already knew all that they
[02:44:57.200 --> 02:45:06.480]  were telling you in a science fiction book oh who cares about the master priest who can who built
[02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:13.120]  our current reality by siphoning off the intellect and intelligence of humanity
[02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:23.280]  having visions they believed being directed by spiritual entities to then go out and find the
[02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:29.840]  minds that could help them manifest and build it with the technological scientific elite that
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:37.360]  eisenhower talked about we're talking about people who believe they basically are avatars like the
[02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:46.000]  movie avatar with spiritual life forms entering them and then directing them whether you believe
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:54.400]  any of this or not do you understand that's who runs things the microchips the helicopters all of it
[02:45:57.040 --> 02:46:02.240]  now here's the big secret humans already knew how to build this stuff
[02:46:04.320 --> 02:46:10.160]  the globalists just simply envision it and know it can be built and then go out and find the people
[02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:15.840]  from the common population generally these inventions aren't coming from the m bread elites
[02:46:17.920 --> 02:46:19.040]  the directives are
[02:46:22.480 --> 02:46:28.480]  so yes we are made in the image of the creator we are made in the image of the entity that
[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:34.720]  created the universe that's basic christian cosmology but do you not see what's hidden behind
[02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:39.120]  that because even if none of that's real even if there aren't entities possessing these people
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:45.680]  even if the god and the devil aren't real all that we as a mass group seven and a half billion people
[02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:52.560]  are able to envision things that science fiction a hundred years ago is reality today
[02:46:54.240 --> 02:47:00.320]  science fiction 20 years ago our reality next month science fiction five years ago
[02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:08.960]  reality in three months science fiction a year ago reality in five years as you notice it's
[02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:15.920]  compacting in time now as the inventions compound and accelerate building something really big and
[02:47:15.920 --> 02:47:20.480]  there's one spirit trying to build something wholesome and good and happy for humans that is
[02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:27.600]  long-term truly sustainable beautiful great empowering free will based but that construction
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:33.280]  is under attack instead we see what's really being built and let me tell you it's the ugliest thing
[02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:39.600]  the universe ever saw it's women pouring drano in their eyes and national british television
[02:47:39.600 --> 02:47:46.000]  saying it's wonderful it's the state coming and telling your seven-year-old how to be transgender
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:51.200]  in your life sexualizing your child pedophilia out in the open they've got to get you ready for
[02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:58.560]  crazy stuff because you ain't seen nothing yet this is the kickoff of a total war against humanity
[02:47:58.560 --> 02:48:06.640]  because the elite whether they're whatever they are do not want humans to get what is about to be
[02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:16.800]  built we're supposed to build it we're builders we're geniuses we're incredible we don't know it
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:23.840]  we don't understand it it's been kept from us we're building the spaceships all of it for the scum
[02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:33.840]  and then the future doesn't need us anymore all we are is a bunch of body parts all we are is a
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:38.240]  bunch of cannon fodder all we are is a bunch of trash to them and they tell us all day with the
[02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:42.240]  message you're trash you're ugly you're scum you're filthy you hate yourself but you kind of could
[02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:47.760]  be strong if you pour drano in your eyes or if you chop your your your member off or if you uh
[02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:52.800]  you know get all this review you know join with a group i didn't be politics join with a big group
[02:48:52.800 --> 02:48:58.000]  that we can direct and then you'll be powerful then you join the group you're not powerful
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:01.440]  all right i said i'd cover a bunch of news and i've done okay today but i i didn't get to a
[02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:07.200]  bunch of it and paul wasan's coming up he'll cover a lot of it but uh i really prayed last night as
[02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:10.320]  hard as i could and this morning that i would just come in here and really just get to the bottom of
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:18.480]  it we've got to get off this planet once we hit that stride we'll be able to terraform look how
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:23.520]  far we've come so far and then look how far we can go we've got to become a type one type one
[02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:29.040]  civilization we've got to reach out to other people we've got to transcend the globalist
[02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:34.800]  we have to realize their larger plan we have to see it for what it is and then it it's really
[02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:38.880]  laughable what they're doing and then you know they're going to end up failing because no matter
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:45.760]  what they do to humanity no matter how oppressive how destructive how evil it will hurt the general
[02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:51.920]  massive people but it will cause others to resist in ways we can't even imagine that will bring down
[02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:55.200]  this system and that's why they're so scared of us if you look at globalists with their
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:50:00.160]  hubris their act how they're acting tough they are scared to death of good men and women
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.560]  you carry the light and the dark of the night and they know it
[02:50:06.480 --> 02:50:13.680]  and they were brought into this power not as rulers but as minions as worker bees
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:19.520]  slaves and they're scared of their master their slaves and they are trying to do the best job

[02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:32.160]  you were given an earlier brainwashing cultural template and even some of your parents and stuff
[02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:38.000]  that wasn't globalist if you're 56 years old if you're 20 you are immersed in this and shoot out
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:44.960]  and called out in class and told all day how bad you are I know a lot of ut students folks that
[02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:48.640]  have gone back to school and things and they say no matter what class you're in you're called out
[02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:56.080]  you're ridiculed if you're white uh you know you are uh told that you're inherently evil and it's
[02:55:56.080 --> 02:56:01.120]  not even by the so-called minority students this is led by the teachers a lot of them who are quote
[02:56:01.120 --> 02:56:08.400]  white and and this is a war this is a culture war to make everybody identify according to class
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:11.840]  and what color they are to put everybody in groups make everybody fight with each other
[02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:20.320]  so now they even have the old left coming out like South Park and people uh like Jerry Seinfeld
[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:25.200]  saying this is terrible let's see the globalists knew that would happen they don't care because
[02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:31.360]  people under 25 or so this is all they know and they have been dumbed down so much the studies
[02:56:31.360 --> 02:56:36.720]  show not all young people but on average that folks they don't even know where state capitals are
[02:56:36.720 --> 02:56:39.760]  you've seen the people mark dies talks to the one of you know nine out of ten want to put
[02:56:39.760 --> 02:56:47.840]  gunners in FEMA camps i mean these people will do anything they're told so the globalists are
[02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:53.440]  testing right now pushing lesbian swedish bishop once christian crosses removed from churches
[02:56:54.240 --> 02:56:58.480]  in sweden now that muslims are arriving she says give the churches to the muslims
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:03.200]  i'm not against muslims but they're going to use them in this clash because they're not going to
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:09.360]  give their culture up we've been trained to give our culture up pc police want to ban ham
[02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:14.800]  sandwiches because muslims find them offensive we told you this was coming businesses should ban
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:19.200]  ham sandwiches and sausage rolls from the workplace and they team up the left vegetarians
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:23.760]  are offensive to muslims and other religions according to new guidelines written for employers
[02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:28.400]  and this is what's accepted by the uk government's policy by these groups and put into government
[02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:33.840]  handbooks the guidelines published by co-exist house a us uk based interfaith group recommended
[02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:39.280]  outright ban on pork products from office kitchens next will be meat itself and it just goes
[02:57:39.280 --> 02:57:44.560]  in they even have the bishops calling for it so there you go because these aren't bishops
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:49.440]  the seminaries got taken over 60 70 years ago by the rocker fillers on record in europe and here
[02:57:49.440 --> 02:57:54.640]  they then just put their people in and you go to these mainline churches now catholic or
[02:57:54.640 --> 02:57:59.760]  protestant and you walk in and i mean you're hearing a government doctrine and in a year
[02:57:59.760 --> 02:58:09.440]  they can change agent from jesus you know was the son of god to jesus was nobody and jesus failed and
[02:58:09.440 --> 02:58:13.920]  your children need to be given to the pedophiles and then people have been incrementally done it
[02:58:13.920 --> 02:58:19.840]  manipulated where they can't give up they can't leave that church then they go in 501c3 and kill

[03:00:33.680 --> 03:00:40.080]  all being announced so i do come to you from the central texas command center in occupied territory
[03:00:40.080 --> 03:00:44.480]  female reason six they haven't mopped up everywhere they haven't taken over everywhere in fact the
[03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:49.040]  states are fighting back congress is fighting back we got to admit how much trouble we're in
[03:00:49.600 --> 03:00:55.680]  to be able to beat this not eating around these are not environmentalist wackos they're not liberal
[03:00:55.680 --> 03:01:00.880]  crazy people they're cult leaders that can order their people to put drain on their eyes and they
[03:01:00.880 --> 03:01:07.600]  do they use hardcore mind control but you can break off their mind control anytime you want
[03:01:07.600 --> 03:01:11.760]  by simply flipping the script and realizing they're the enemy you've got the hardware program
[03:01:11.760 --> 03:01:16.400]  to defeat these people i suggest you activate it let's go ahead and talk to rex in mississippi
[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:24.000]  you're on the air welcome hey alex uh first time caller welcome to see you for a few months now
[03:01:25.440 --> 03:01:33.440]  i just wanted to ask you uh i noticed uh an article uh the petition for 2012 to impeach obama
[03:01:35.360 --> 03:01:41.120]  yes sir and i was checking to see uh how that went i don't know what the final result of that was
[03:01:41.120 --> 03:01:45.280]  well here here is they set up the white house petition to act like they listened to people
[03:01:45.280 --> 03:01:49.040]  and as a stunt so they could pick the things they wanted and claim it came from the people
[03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:53.280]  and have their own groups write the stuff so we admitted the thing was a joke so we said use it
[03:01:53.280 --> 03:01:59.200]  like a toilet uh and just go in there and just point out the hypocrisy uh you know so we said do
[03:01:59.200 --> 03:02:04.720]  it do a petition to deport pierce morgan so he'd take the bait and have me on a show uh so all
[03:02:04.720 --> 03:02:09.120]  the petition is good for is to take it away from them that's why they never promoted anymore now
[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:14.800]  it was 5 000 signatures and it was 10 000 the 50 000 100 000 so we push it above 100 000 to get
[03:02:14.800 --> 03:02:19.280]  attention and then they just ignore it but but we you know we had petitions to turn our power
[03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:23.840]  plants back on and stuff it's just been a very useful tool taking it away from the enemy that's
[03:02:23.840 --> 03:02:30.080]  what we do we take their weapons and we use them against them okay uh well i've noticed there's been
[03:02:30.080 --> 03:02:39.280]  a lot of other uh people like i saw a lady on the internet named orly tates uh she's brought uh
[03:02:39.280 --> 03:02:45.440]  impeachment proceedings against him but every time it seems like it doesn't work well you gotta
[03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:50.000]  have it by the house and you've gotta have him indicted in the house tried in the senate i appreciate
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:57.120]  your call rex good to hear from you lex rex let's talk to matthew in mississippi you're on the year
[03:02:57.120 --> 03:03:04.240]  here hey how's it going good brother go ahead hey so uh i guess uh i guess i'll start off by saying
[03:03:04.240 --> 03:03:08.320]  i've been listening to the show a long time my dad listens to this show we've been uh big fans for
[03:03:08.320 --> 03:03:14.160]  several years now um but anyways uh i'm actually an umquad community college alumni um i was gonna
[03:03:14.160 --> 03:03:17.680]  be an umquad singers performance group for a couple years with toured spain get a whole bunch
[03:03:17.680 --> 03:03:23.360]  of stuff over there and great time but uh anyways so i've got a lot of family a lot of friends that
[03:03:23.360 --> 03:03:27.600]  go to umquad in fact especially called a three-year school because of the fine and performing arts
[03:03:27.600 --> 03:03:34.720]  deal um but anyways uh so the thing that catches me is a few things one thing during the attack
[03:03:35.680 --> 03:03:41.440]  i talked to my mom who was under a table at the time she was in the cafeteria which is also the uh
[03:03:42.480 --> 03:03:47.200]  like the main administration registry building that kind of thing and uh and so i'm talking to her
[03:03:47.200 --> 03:03:51.040]  and she goes uh yeah they took down the first shooter and we're waiting for them to take down
[03:03:51.040 --> 03:03:57.920]  the second shooter and a lot of my friends have sent me texts that say yeah they're waiting for
[03:03:57.920 --> 03:04:02.000]  them to take down the second shooter this kind of deal and then i've been looking on the media going
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:05.680]  where is the information on the second shooter yeah that kind of stuff happens a lot and i'm not
[03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:10.160]  going to say this was staged but they were going to stage you know fake hijackings they've been
[03:04:10.160 --> 03:04:15.520]  caught staging other stuff they staged fast and furious so they're a hundred percent absolutely
[03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:21.040]  capable of staging this uh but it doesn't matter because no amount of mass shootings is our fault
[03:04:21.040 --> 03:04:24.880]  as gun owners and they're gonna have to really stage a lot of them to get the numbers up because
[03:04:24.880 --> 03:04:29.600]  it's still not above 200 a year uh and so it's a tragedy i'm sorry for those that got killed but
[03:04:29.600 --> 03:04:34.880]  it's nothing compared to 300 000 killed by our criminal government funding al-qaeda in syria and
[03:04:34.880 --> 03:04:40.080]  was upwards of 100 000 in libya good job math you appreciate you by the way i didn't even mention
[03:04:40.080 --> 03:04:44.080]  that yes the un's gonna take over your local police departments dean wanted to talk about that but
[03:04:44.080 --> 03:04:49.680]  paul wasin can go to him uh un take over your local governments and actually have them go around and

[03:04:54.240 --> 03:05:00.240]  department read the attorney general talking about it i mean this is this is real kit daniels info
[03:05:00.240 --> 03:05:05.600]  wars dot com cnn reportedly altered the photo of the biracial organ shooter to make him look more
[03:05:05.600 --> 03:05:10.640]  white now that's a shocking revelation so let me repeat that cnn apparently doctored the photo of
[03:05:10.640 --> 03:05:15.360]  the biracial organ shooter christopher mercer to make people think he's calcassian mercer uploaded
[03:05:15.360 --> 03:05:21.040]  a selfie to social media but when cnn used the photo in its news broadcast mercer's skin tone
[03:05:21.040 --> 03:05:26.080]  had dramatically changed that of a white man furthermore cnn did not show photos of mercer's
[03:05:26.080 --> 03:05:30.480]  mother who was african-american and the network also didn't report that mercer was involved in
[03:05:30.480 --> 03:05:34.800]  the school play which contradicts the media's claim that he was a loner why would they do that
[03:05:34.800 --> 03:05:39.600]  because a biracial organ shooter does not fit into the establishment's propaganda that mass
[03:05:39.600 --> 03:05:43.680]  shooters are white racist men they also don't let you know that mercer was associated with the
[03:05:43.680 --> 03:05:48.000]  black lives matter movement because it'd be a political nightmare for obama if the public
[03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:52.320]  knew the truth it'd be hard for him to demand more gun control if more people started to realize
[03:05:52.320 --> 03:05:56.400]  that president obama is fueling racial division across the us once again this is kit daniels

[03:08:09.600 --> 03:08:21.120]  and the gcn radio network we're back live on the alex joneshow it's the fourth hour overdrive
[03:08:21.120 --> 03:08:26.240]  on your host paul joseph watson we've got a ton of news coming up over the next hour we've also
[03:08:26.240 --> 03:08:30.640]  got david night popping in at the end of the hour to preview the info wars nightly news
[03:08:31.360 --> 03:08:36.960]  we're gonna play a video probably in the next segment or this segment out of a migrant migrant
[03:08:36.960 --> 03:08:41.920]  camp in europe where one of the refugees is complaining about the fact that he doesn't
[03:08:41.920 --> 03:08:49.440]  get sex and that he had to stay in a taxpayer funded hospital for three days because of his
[03:08:49.440 --> 03:08:56.560]  failure to get sex gave him blue balls that's right it's going to get pretty graphic in this hour
[03:08:56.560 --> 03:09:00.960]  so if there are young children watching you might want to turn down the volume because
[03:09:00.960 --> 03:09:07.280]  we're going to delve into some pretty graphic and disgusting issues as you would expect from the
[03:09:07.280 --> 03:09:13.520]  progressive left we're going to get into the the woman who made herself deliberately blind
[03:09:13.520 --> 03:09:20.720]  by pouring drain cleaner in her eyes and how that was treated by the media coverage of the
[03:09:20.720 --> 03:09:26.240]  issue this is completely bizarre but it's part for the course of what we've come to expect from
[03:09:26.240 --> 03:09:31.520]  progressives and social justice warriors we're going to get to your calls probably in the next
[03:09:31.520 --> 03:09:37.600]  half hour as well wanted to start off with russia because of course we've had over the past week
[03:09:38.240 --> 03:09:45.520]  basically russia has decimated isis in many areas it took them a week to better what it took nato
[03:09:45.520 --> 03:09:53.280]  and the us to do in seven months seven months of bombing isis in syria and russia has basically
[03:09:53.280 --> 03:10:00.320]  already beaten that so now nato and this is breaking news up on the bbc news website nato is
[03:10:00.320 --> 03:10:07.680]  incredibly but hurt about the fact that russia is actually killing terrorists in syria and we
[03:10:07.680 --> 03:10:16.000]  know why that is because isis has the same agenda as the nato as nato in the u.s. they want to topple
[03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:22.480]  bashar al-asad russia has a different agenda they want to maintain asad in power and they actually
[03:10:22.480 --> 03:10:28.640]  want to kill isis terrorists god forbid which is why they're being demonized in the media and from
[03:10:28.640 --> 03:10:37.280]  the white house and nato over the past week so bbc news reports syria conflict nato warns russia on
[03:10:37.280 --> 03:10:43.520]  airstrikes this is a breaking news which went up about an hour ago nato has urged russia to end
[03:10:43.520 --> 03:10:50.480]  airstrikes quote on the syrian opposition and civilians days after mosco began raids to support
[03:10:50.480 --> 03:11:00.480]  syria's government okay let's get this straight syrian opposition okay the us spent 500 million
[03:11:00.480 --> 03:11:07.600]  dollars to train these so-called moderate syrian rebels it came out and this is a guardian report
[03:11:07.600 --> 03:11:16.560]  us has trained only four or five syrian fighters against isis top general testifies so general
[03:11:16.560 --> 03:11:23.200]  laud austin of course it was now a few weeks ago testified that this 500 million dollar program
[03:11:23.200 --> 03:11:31.760]  to train the moderate rebels has resulted in only four or five actual moderate rebels that are not
[03:11:31.760 --> 03:11:37.760]  jihadists that are not going to hand their weapons over to isis that are not going to join al-qaeda
[03:11:37.760 --> 03:11:44.480]  affiliated groups in syria the first chance they get which is what happened to the vast majority
[03:11:44.480 --> 03:11:51.120]  of all the other moderate quote moderate rebels that the us and nato have been backing for the past
[03:11:51.120 --> 03:11:57.120]  three four years so that's why the us and nato are incredibly butthurt about the fact that
[03:11:57.120 --> 03:12:04.640]  russia is killing isis terrorists because isis wants to topple bachar al-asad as does the us
[03:12:04.640 --> 03:12:12.080]  and nato so now they're basically threatening russia to end the airstrikes the article continues
[03:12:12.080 --> 03:12:19.200]  moscow says it is targeting islamic state and other islamist positions but us led allies and turkey
[03:12:19.200 --> 03:12:26.560]  say government opponent opponents are targeted bear in mind this is the same turkish government
[03:12:26.560 --> 03:12:35.200]  and military that has been bombing the Kurds in iraq who have been fighting isis so again nato
[03:12:35.200 --> 03:12:40.800]  and turkey are actually targeting the people who are fighting isis while supporting these quote
[03:12:40.800 --> 03:12:46.480]  moderate rebels who aren't moderate at all their jihadists who are handing over their weapons to
[03:12:46.480 --> 03:12:53.200]  isis to these al-qaeda affiliated groups like jabat al-nuzra and in many cases defecting to them as
[03:12:53.200 --> 03:13:00.160]  well russia comes along in a week obliterates all these key command centers these key isis command
[03:13:00.160 --> 03:13:06.560]  centers but we can't have that can we oh no russia's bad russia's the bad guy now but actually trying
[03:13:06.560 --> 03:13:12.560]  actually trying to kill isis terrorists and if you look at the actual numbers we've had articles
[03:13:12.560 --> 03:13:19.840]  before on info was about these isis jihadists miraculously discovering huge weapons caches dropped
[03:13:19.840 --> 03:13:27.520]  by the us military and then you look you drill down into the actual statistics the us has dropped
[03:13:27.520 --> 03:13:36.080]  43 bombs on isis per day since the campaign began which was about seven months ago compare that to
[03:13:36.080 --> 03:13:49.680]  1991 the iraq war the first gulf war 6163 bombs dropped per day in comparison to 43 in the supposed
[03:13:49.680 --> 03:13:55.520]  war on isis the airstrikes on isis that were launched by the us and nato seven months ago so
[03:13:56.320 --> 03:14:02.400]  they're obviously not targeting isis there are reports of isis getting a heads up getting a
[03:14:02.400 --> 03:14:07.840]  warning before these airstrikes happen and fleeing to a different location which is why
[03:14:08.400 --> 03:14:15.040]  obama's plan to degrade isis has been a complete failure for the past seven months they've only
[03:14:15.040 --> 03:14:20.560]  grown in strength they've only gained more territory they've lost some territory in some areas
[03:14:20.560 --> 03:14:27.600]  gained it in others then booting comes along in a week basically just obliterates dozens of isis
[03:14:27.600 --> 03:14:34.080]  command centers and nato and the us are not happy about it because they trained these moderate rebels
[03:14:34.080 --> 03:14:39.600]  who handed over the weapons to isis because they know they share the same agenda which is to topple
[03:14:39.600 --> 03:14:46.080]  a sad and also impose a no-fly zone over syria which is why they're opposing this russian
[03:14:46.960 --> 03:14:51.760]  war plan these russian airstrikes because it's upsetting the agenda to impose this
[03:14:51.760 --> 03:14:58.240]  no-fly zone which of course is key to controlling the country and eventually to bombing actual
[03:14:58.800 --> 03:15:04.480]  syrian government positions and taking out president bashar alasad wishes being the agenda
[03:15:04.480 --> 03:15:12.880]  all along and what's amazing about it is they lectured russia for a week the whole of last week
[03:15:12.880 --> 03:15:18.400]  they lectured they lectured russia about the fact that they were quote targeting civilians and
[03:15:18.400 --> 03:15:24.720]  opposition forces turned out that was completely fake it was a soros sponsored group called white
[03:15:24.720 --> 03:15:33.600]  helmets they released an image of this jihadist this quote moderate rebel with with a child in
[03:15:33.600 --> 03:15:39.840]  his arms bloody bruised potentially dead and basically they said this is a result of russian
[03:15:39.840 --> 03:15:47.040]  airstrikes turns out the photo was about a week old the casualty was a result of syrian government
[03:15:47.040 --> 03:15:52.640]  airstrikes but they faked it and blamed it on russia so they could have this whole narrative in
[03:15:52.640 --> 03:15:58.160]  the media that these russian airstrikes which are killing icis terrorists are in fact killing
[03:15:58.160 --> 03:16:03.920]  civilians and isn't it amazing that the mainstream media suddenly develops this you know deep
[03:16:03.920 --> 03:16:09.760]  compassion for civilian victims of airstrikes which has been completely absent for the past
[03:16:09.760 --> 03:16:18.640]  15 years or so what made it even more darkly ironic is the fact that on saturday in afghanistan
[03:16:18.640 --> 03:16:26.480]  the us bombed a hospital and killed 19 people so again lecturing russia all week about them
[03:16:26.480 --> 03:16:33.840]  killing civilians and then on saturday there's a us airstrike that kills 19 civilians at least
[03:16:33.840 --> 03:16:40.080]  in this hospital in afghanistan so again complete hypocrisy on the media narrative
[03:16:40.720 --> 03:16:44.480]  and they're desperate to stop these russian airstrikes because they're actually having an
[03:16:44.480 --> 03:16:51.440]  impact and killing icis which the us and nato don't want they want icis to remain in the region
[03:16:51.440 --> 03:16:57.760]  because their goal their end game is not to destroy icis it's to topple president bashar aleh sad
[03:16:57.760 --> 03:17:04.880]  and of course that goal is shared by icis so it's in their interest to keep them in the region and
[03:17:04.880 --> 03:17:10.640]  that's why the offensive against icis has been so weak russia comes along and completely obliterates
[03:17:10.640 --> 03:17:16.240]  it then you've got this whole narrative about you know you had mccain last week come out and say
[03:17:16.880 --> 03:17:23.760]  we should arm the syrian rebels to take out russian fighter jets because we did it in afghanistan
[03:17:23.760 --> 03:17:29.360]  and it was such a success it didn't lead to the rise of the taliban it didn't lead to the
[03:17:29.360 --> 03:17:35.440]  rise of al qaeda it didn't lead to the rise of asama bin laden and 911 now it was a complete
[03:17:35.440 --> 03:17:41.600]  success and that's what we should do again so that's again they're trying to create a provocation
[03:17:42.240 --> 03:17:48.480]  now if you remember back in 2003 this leaked memo before the iraq war when they were trying to
[03:17:48.480 --> 03:17:54.240]  find a justification for the iraq war the whole weapons of mass destruction narrative
[03:17:54.240 --> 03:18:01.440]  was failing 31st of january 2003 we had this memo confidential memo reveals u.s plan to
[03:18:01.440 --> 03:18:06.480]  provoke an invasion of iraq quote this is a guardian article bush told blare the u.s had
[03:18:06.480 --> 03:18:12.720]  drawn up a provocative plan to fly u2 reconnaissance aircraft painted in un colors over iraq with
[03:18:12.720 --> 03:18:18.720]  fighter cover bush said that if saddam fired at the planes this would put the iraqi leader
[03:18:18.720 --> 03:18:25.360]  in breach of un resolutions so there was a plan on record it was never put into action but there
[03:18:25.360 --> 03:18:32.080]  was a plan to fake a shootdown of a u2 plane over iraq to blame it on saddam hassein and
[03:18:32.080 --> 03:18:38.160]  create a pretext for the invasion over the past few days we've had these russian fighter jets
[03:18:38.160 --> 03:18:44.400]  almost collide with israeli jets we've had them go into turkish territory turkey turns them back
[03:18:44.400 --> 03:18:49.280]  these russian fighter jets and basically they're saying that turkey would have had the right to
[03:18:49.280 --> 03:18:56.560]  shoot down those russian fighter jets again echoing john mccain's rhetoric that we should
[03:18:56.560 --> 03:19:00.640]  arm these individuals to shoot down these russian fighter jets so they're trying to create a
[03:19:00.640 --> 03:19:06.080]  precedent they're trying to create a provocation and i'm not saying this is going to happen but it
[03:19:06.080 --> 03:19:12.240]  could be that they would they would stage a kind of collision a mid-air collision between maybe
[03:19:12.240 --> 03:19:18.640]  israelian turkish fighter jets to blame it on russia as a pretext to go to the un and say
[03:19:18.640 --> 03:19:24.160]  these russian airstrikes on isis need to stop even though they're not killing civilians no evidence
[03:19:24.160 --> 03:19:30.400]  of that they're taking out isis command center centers and they're having a massive impact
[03:19:30.400 --> 03:19:36.720]  but they don't like that so i think there could be some kind of provocation on the on the store of
[03:19:36.720 --> 03:19:44.000]  this un plan back in 2003 to create this false reason to invade iraq they could go with that
[03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:48.960]  narrative once again that's what it seems to be building up to we'll explore that and more after

[03:25:51.280 --> 03:25:57.840]  wars dot com we'll start with this texas top top cop isis may be infiltrating border this is a great
[03:25:57.840 --> 03:26:03.120]  article by adan salazar and we spent a lot of time on the texas border over the past i guess
[03:26:03.120 --> 03:26:08.560]  year and a half now myself and adan we are down there last year and we're talking to ice agents
[03:26:08.560 --> 03:26:13.840]  border patrol agents they say yes we do have people coming over the border whether they're ms 13 or
[03:26:13.840 --> 03:26:19.360]  isis in the case of this article we see various reports of people ms 13 going to other parts
[03:26:19.360 --> 03:26:24.720]  of the country and just goes to show that not everybody coming into the country is from central
[03:26:24.720 --> 03:26:29.280]  or south america you have people coming in from all over the world some people with very legitimate
[03:26:29.280 --> 03:26:33.280]  reasons uh you know they're worried about the violence in syria they're worried about the drug
[03:26:33.280 --> 03:26:38.400]  war in mexico or failed drug war as it may be so some people have very legitimate concerns
[03:26:38.400 --> 03:26:43.520]  for coming here but they also have to realize that it's a lot of us intervention that are making
[03:26:43.520 --> 03:26:48.320]  some of these situations worse case in point uh the senator drug cartels getting their weapons
[03:26:48.320 --> 03:26:54.160]  from fast and furious and also isis and other people having things airdropped courtesy of the
[03:26:54.160 --> 03:27:00.000]  obama and western back governments going now to pc police want to ban ham sandwiches because
[03:27:00.000 --> 03:27:06.000]  muslims might find them offensive by kit daniels now this is just another in a string of stories
[03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:10.640]  we've seen previously uh people trying to ban peanut butter and jelly sandwiches because in
[03:27:10.640 --> 03:27:15.600]  some countries they don't eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches it's just a pc police gone completely
[03:27:15.600 --> 03:27:21.040]  out of control they say you can't wear american flag shirts you can't have uh you know uh american
[03:27:21.040 --> 03:27:26.240]  type holidays in the school system anymore because some people may be offensive i just can't imagine
[03:27:26.240 --> 03:27:32.080]  going someplace you know south south america going to uh canada mexico anyplace else and telling them
[03:27:32.080 --> 03:27:36.880]  not to have their uh cultural holidays because it may offend people i think they would just laugh
[03:27:36.880 --> 03:27:42.160]  in your face and this by apology also watching migrants complain about lack of sex in refugee
[03:27:42.160 --> 03:27:47.600]  camps well bro it's not a brothel it's a refugee camp if you want your sex you need to go someplace
[03:27:47.600 --> 03:27:55.120]  else also we have chancellor merkel lord god send illegal immigrants now i run into so many people
[03:27:55.120 --> 03:28:00.400]  who say you know it's uh it's their responsibility you know it's god's work to help people and yes
[03:28:00.400 --> 03:28:05.840]  it is god's work for you to go and uh be uh charitable to people but a lot of the people who
[03:28:05.840 --> 03:28:09.920]  are making these claims aren't doing anything to actually help the people who are coming over the
[03:28:09.920 --> 03:28:14.240]  border they'll get up on tv they'll have their you know their marches or whatever i'm like well
[03:28:14.240 --> 03:28:18.160]  how much money or how much resources did you actually give to these facilities that are
[03:28:18.160 --> 03:28:23.600]  housing these people and the answer is close to none if any at all and also as i spoke about last
[03:28:23.600 --> 03:28:28.640]  week on the info wars nightly news you know we see uh president obama saying let's you know do so
[03:28:28.640 --> 03:28:32.640]  much to help all these people they're a homeless people who sleep in front of the white house if
[03:28:32.640 --> 03:28:38.560]  if you guys don't know this myself and david night we were out there last week and i guess it's
[03:28:38.560 --> 03:28:42.720]  the south lawn but there's a big park in front of the white house you have the white house fence
[03:28:42.720 --> 03:28:47.120]  you have a big park out there they're a homeless people that sleep in front of the white house in
[03:28:47.120 --> 03:28:52.480]  the united states of america in 2015 during the obama administration you'll see him so much during
[03:28:52.480 --> 03:28:56.320]  the daytime because they always kick him out because you can't be there when obama walks outside
[03:28:56.320 --> 03:29:01.040]  but if you go there at night you'll see him sleep on the bench so if you want to talk about humanitarian
[03:29:01.040 --> 03:29:05.520]  intervention why don't you just walk outside and give those people a job or let them stay in your
[03:29:05.520 --> 03:29:11.360]  lavish house and we have things on the trans-pacific partnership deal has been reached great article
[03:29:11.360 --> 03:29:16.160]  by curtain memo now david night is going to be hosting the info wars nightly news tonight
[03:29:16.160 --> 03:29:22.240]  he has documented the tpp in such detail so definitely stay tuned for that i'm sure he
[03:29:22.240 --> 03:29:27.280]  will get all into that and also a lesbian swedish bishop wants christian crosses removed from
[03:29:27.280 --> 03:29:32.240]  churches to please muslims this is completely ridiculous uh this along with some of the recent
[03:29:32.240 --> 03:29:35.920]  statements that the pope has made not so much about lesbians but some other things that he's
[03:29:35.920 --> 03:29:40.160]  mentioned just people who are supposedly supposed to be pushing the christian faith
[03:29:40.160 --> 03:29:45.600]  are doing everything but that stay tuned this is the info wars overdrive hour jacari jackson
[03:29:45.600 --> 03:29:54.640]  along with paul joseph watts we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[03:29:54.640 --> 03:30:03.760]  network kit daniels info wars dot com president obama implied that the federal government should
[03:30:03.760 --> 03:30:08.240]  confiscate all guns that's right the president responsible for the deaths of women and children
[03:30:08.240 --> 03:30:12.400]  via drone strikes is now trying to eradicate second amendment when obama responded to the
[03:30:12.400 --> 03:30:16.960]  october 1st attack on an organ community college he went beyond his usual demand for more gun
[03:30:16.960 --> 03:30:21.280]  control and suggested that america should consider outright banning guns just like australia and
[03:30:21.280 --> 03:30:25.680]  great britain but it's hypocritical for obama to demand that americans turn in their guns when
[03:30:25.680 --> 03:30:30.080]  according to the pentagon the obama administration is backing ices in its war against the syrian
[03:30:30.080 --> 03:30:35.440]  government in fact in september 2013 president obama waived a federal law specifically designed
[03:30:35.440 --> 03:30:40.240]  to keep the us government from supplying firearms to terrorist groups such as ices on the very same
[03:30:40.240 --> 03:30:45.200]  day he demanded more gun control in response to the dc navy yard shooting in other words obama is
[03:30:45.200 --> 03:30:50.480]  shipping guns to islamic militants aka moderate rebels while simultaneously trying to disarm

[03:33:23.440 --> 03:33:29.520]  over the past couple of weeks in terms of mainstream media coverage but it still continues to rage
[03:33:29.520 --> 03:33:36.960]  we've got reports about 900 000 migrants coming into germany before the end of the year a total of
[03:33:36.960 --> 03:33:44.400]  1.5 million for the year now we featured videos about the behavior of some of these migrants
[03:33:44.400 --> 03:33:50.400]  which isn't being showcased by the media of course we've had the clapping germans as they arrive you
[03:33:50.400 --> 03:33:55.600]  know dutch people singing songs they're all welcoming they're rolling out the red carpet
[03:33:55.600 --> 03:34:00.480]  and then you look at the actual videos of what's going on and the reports of what are coming out
[03:34:00.480 --> 03:34:06.000]  of these migrant camps and it's disturbing to say the least and it's not being covered by
[03:34:06.000 --> 03:34:12.080]  media by mainstream media which is why one of the videos i made about it got 1.8 million views
[03:34:12.080 --> 03:34:17.440]  because there's a thirst for this knowledge because people just aren't seeing it on the likes of you
[03:34:17.440 --> 03:34:24.560]  know abc cbs fox news and bbc news it's all being completely positive this is going to have a
[03:34:24.560 --> 03:34:31.200]  wonderful impact on our culture and society once we welcome these people in well take a listen to what
[03:34:31.200 --> 03:34:42.160]  one migrant said outside a quote refugee camp in europe here's the clip uh doctor say make this i sleep
[03:34:42.160 --> 03:34:50.480]  three days in hospital because this is a problem what's the problem problem problem problem here
[03:34:50.480 --> 03:35:01.840]  here here problem there exactly balls it's very big like this it's really he said make make sex
[03:35:01.840 --> 03:35:09.200]  with anyone or make anything we are 400 people okay how i can bring the girl to here okay she
[03:35:09.200 --> 03:35:16.880]  go like bring uh burger she go like make 400 times six shit so the first guy in that clip
[03:35:16.880 --> 03:35:24.480]  it basically was pointing to his groin and saying that he had blue balls he was in prison
[03:35:24.480 --> 03:35:31.680]  he was in a hospital a taxpayer funded hospital for three days with blue balls because there
[03:35:31.680 --> 03:35:37.760]  was no one to have sex with atlas migrant camp though again the narrative is they're fleeing war
[03:35:37.760 --> 03:35:44.240]  they're fleeing isis persecution they're starving they're desperate and yes in some cases they are
[03:35:44.240 --> 03:35:50.320]  but it's a minority you know only one fifth of these so-called migrants are actually syrian
[03:35:50.320 --> 03:35:56.880]  refugees the rest of them are fleeing to a higher standard of living 72 percent of them are men
[03:35:56.880 --> 03:36:03.360]  according to the un's own figures and so now we're seeing all these videos of these mostly men
[03:36:03.360 --> 03:36:10.080]  outside migrant camps in europe complaining we had another video which is embedded in the info wars
[03:36:10.080 --> 03:36:14.880]  article which is up there right now about this video migrant complaints about lack of sex in
[03:36:14.880 --> 03:36:21.440]  refugee camp where it's a refugee camp in the Netherlands and they're complaining about slow
[03:36:21.440 --> 03:36:29.600]  internet connections lack of being given money for cigarettes and adequate food so these are the
[03:36:29.600 --> 03:36:35.120]  concerns of these migrants who are supposedly fleeing isis persecution of course they're not
[03:36:35.120 --> 03:36:41.440]  syrian refugees they're fleeing to a higher standard of living and now they're complaining about
[03:36:41.440 --> 03:36:46.800]  not having enough sex well that isn't a problem for some of the migrants in Germany and we've
[03:36:46.800 --> 03:36:54.560]  reported on this before who are forcing women and underage girls children into prostitution
[03:36:54.560 --> 03:37:01.200]  in these migrant camps in fact three top social organizations in Germany just a few weeks ago
[03:37:01.200 --> 03:37:07.520]  came out with this huge letter warning the german government basically that this activity was going
[03:37:07.520 --> 03:37:13.680]  on in these migrant camps the people in charge of the camps were doing absolutely nothing about it
[03:37:13.680 --> 03:37:19.680]  in fact some of them were complicit being paid off to allow this to happen so migrant women
[03:37:19.680 --> 03:37:26.160]  and children being raped by these men in these migrant camps they're not having any problems
[03:37:26.160 --> 03:37:32.480]  getting sex and the german government is covering it up they're covering it up with facebook censorship
[03:37:32.480 --> 03:37:38.560]  mark zuckerberg who is of course is an expert censorship given his close ties to the communist
[03:37:38.560 --> 03:37:46.320]  chinese government is now working with merkel with the german government and with x star z officials
[03:37:46.320 --> 03:37:54.080]  that's confirmed the very group in east germany that spied on hunted down political dissidents
[03:37:54.080 --> 03:38:01.200]  now the next agent in that very organization is working with zuckerberg and the german government
[03:38:01.200 --> 03:38:06.640]  to go after people who may quote anti migrant comments on facebook they're being threatened
[03:38:06.640 --> 03:38:12.400]  with dismissal from their jobs in extreme cases they're being threatened with their children
[03:38:12.400 --> 03:38:18.480]  being taken away simply for making anti migrant comments and then the police in many areas in
[03:38:18.480 --> 03:38:24.640]  germany are now not reporting these rape cases which are impacting not just migrant children
[03:38:24.640 --> 03:38:30.160]  and women but germans living in the local area near these migrant camps the german police are
[03:38:30.160 --> 03:38:37.120]  covering up these cases so as not to quote legitimize right wing demonstrators because
[03:38:37.120 --> 03:38:42.720]  now we're finally seeing an uprising in germany with all these protest groups finally speaking out
[03:38:42.720 --> 03:38:47.840]  against this and they don't want that narrative to be out there so they're covering up these rape
[03:38:47.840 --> 03:38:54.160]  cases the gate stone institute we featured this article listed a bunch of them we also had a
[03:38:54.160 --> 03:39:00.080]  recent um video featured on info wars dot com where it was this arabic speaking woman who got
[03:39:00.080 --> 03:39:04.160]  on a train in budapest which of course is where many of these immigrants come into before they
[03:39:04.160 --> 03:39:09.360]  head to germany she was arabic speaking she lived in the middle east for a number of years
[03:39:09.360 --> 03:39:14.480]  and basically she listened to the conversations that these migrants were having on the train
[03:39:14.480 --> 03:39:20.160]  you know as they cast away food and rob people in train stations as we had the videos we've shown
[03:39:20.160 --> 03:39:27.200]  the videos and they were basically talking about taking her hostage and raping her so this is the
[03:39:27.200 --> 03:39:31.840]  kind of culture and again this is not all the migrants this is not all the refugees but it's
[03:39:31.840 --> 03:39:38.160]  a sizable portion of them this is the culture that we're importing into the west and now
[03:39:38.160 --> 03:39:46.560]  chancellor merkel says lord god sent illegal immigrants thank god for the rape hordes i mean
[03:39:46.560 --> 03:39:52.560]  you know divine intervention we should thank the lord for this great influx of freedom and a
[03:39:52.560 --> 03:39:58.640]  cultural understanding and tolerance as migrant girls and women as germans in those towns are
[03:39:58.640 --> 03:40:04.400]  being raped by these individuals we should bow down and worship angela merkel and if you say a
[03:40:04.400 --> 03:40:10.400]  damn word against it on facebook you will be censored you will be hounded and then this again
[03:40:10.400 --> 03:40:17.520]  we covered this earlier lesbian swedish bishop wants christian crosses removed from church
[03:40:17.520 --> 03:40:25.520]  to please muslims this is in stock home sweden now we talk about sweden every week almost on the
[03:40:25.520 --> 03:40:32.480]  alex joneshire because it's an example of you know progressivism gone mad not only are they
[03:40:32.480 --> 03:40:39.920]  talking about giving isis recruits returning jihadists who come back to sweden taxpayer funded
[03:40:39.920 --> 03:40:47.840]  housing and welfare in fact the head of quote anti-islamophobia in sweden went on to joy and
[03:40:47.840 --> 03:40:54.400]  isis they're telling swedes give up your garages to house these migrants that are coming into the
[03:40:54.400 --> 03:41:00.480]  country and now this top bishop in sweden and this is a report out of sbt which is basically
[03:41:00.480 --> 03:41:07.520]  sweden's national public broadcaster it's basically their version of the bbc she's calling for this
[03:41:07.520 --> 03:41:13.680]  church in stock home to remove the crosses to remove the christian symbols and make the church
[03:41:13.680 --> 03:41:18.880]  more like an airport where they have facilities for muslims to pray and of course move remove all
[03:41:18.880 --> 03:41:27.200]  the christian iconography so as not to upset and offend the muslims she's a woman as a lesbian
[03:41:27.200 --> 03:41:33.680]  who would be executed in some muslim countries because of her sexuality and yet she's rolling
[03:41:33.680 --> 03:41:40.320]  out the red carpet she's selling out christianity just as the pope has done and now saying that
[03:41:40.320 --> 03:41:46.720]  these crosses these christian icons in this church should be removed completely again as
[03:41:46.720 --> 03:41:53.280]  robert spencer writes this is what a society and a culture in the midst of suicide looks like
[03:41:53.280 --> 03:41:58.880]  thankfully there are some people speaking out against this but again if you want to look at
[03:41:58.880 --> 03:42:06.400]  what happens when extreme liberalism runs rampant you only have to look at sweden and that's come
[03:42:06.960 --> 03:42:12.320]  more to the fore over the past few weeks and months as a result of this migrant crisis
[03:42:13.360 --> 03:42:20.480]  now talking about progressive insanity we wrote this article on friday night and we
[03:42:20.480 --> 03:42:26.800]  haven't really talked about it too much pouring drain cleaner in your eyes the next trendy social
[03:42:26.800 --> 03:42:34.640]  justice movement this is a woman who claims that she was born with a will to be blind to be blind
[03:42:34.640 --> 03:42:43.120]  from birth and she actually got a psychologist to pour drain cleaner in her eyes to help her achieve
[03:42:43.120 --> 03:42:50.800]  that great social justice will to be blind to be completely blind let's go to this clip now as
[03:42:50.800 --> 03:42:57.600]  extreme as jewell's case sounds she is not alone dr michael first is a leading expert on the condition
[03:42:57.600 --> 03:43:04.240]  he even coined the term b i i d to describe it a lot of people who have this just live with it
[03:43:04.240 --> 03:43:09.680]  but they don't take that step of actually actualizing it but a significant minority of people with this
[03:43:09.680 --> 03:43:15.760]  have the feeling so strongly that they will go and do something to make it happen our job is to
[03:43:15.760 --> 03:43:22.080]  reduce suffering however it's possible the question is what could be done people have tried therapy
[03:43:22.080 --> 03:43:28.160]  they've tried medication none of those have really been successful the ethics of whether it is okay
[03:43:28.160 --> 03:43:34.480]  to take a normal person and make them disabled is i think you could make it an ethical case that if
[03:43:34.480 --> 03:43:40.400]  you conceptualize this is treating a condition then it's okay to do it the big fear of course is
[03:43:40.400 --> 03:43:46.000]  somebody goes ahead and gets an amputation it becomes disabled and then changes their mind
[03:43:46.000 --> 03:43:51.280]  i'd like to encourage people to do what makes sense to make them feel better but this is such a
[03:43:51.280 --> 03:43:58.080]  drastic move that it's hard to encourage initially apprehensive jewell has now told her friends in
[03:43:58.080 --> 03:44:05.040]  the blind community about how she took her own side i told her that i didn't care that i think
[03:44:05.040 --> 03:44:12.560]  there's no resentment for her voluntarily taking her eyesight i that's not who i am i just don't
[03:44:12.560 --> 03:44:18.000]  think i've ever known anyone who had that condition i think there's a lot and understood in the medical
[03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:24.480]  community but i'm sure that by what happened to you it will be helpful to somebody else hey jewell
[03:44:24.480 --> 03:44:30.320]  how's it going oh hi y'all does this affect our friendship at all no actually i i want to thank
[03:44:30.320 --> 03:44:36.080]  you for sharing it with me i think it it's it's a really inspiring story actually because you've
[03:44:36.080 --> 03:44:41.040]  overcome a lot here you're a very positive person you contribute a lot to the blind community
[03:44:42.000 --> 03:44:49.040]  it's a really inspiring story did you hear those words pouring drain cleaner in your eyes is really
[03:44:49.040 --> 03:44:55.520]  inspiring and she's a great representative to the blind community of course the blind community
[03:44:55.520 --> 03:45:01.440]  they don't want to be blind it's a crippling disability that they're afflicted with their
[03:45:01.440 --> 03:45:07.520]  entire lives why the hell would this individual be such a great representation a great idol a great
[03:45:07.520 --> 03:45:13.520]  god to them and then listen to what the doctor said this is a woman who got a psychologist to
[03:45:13.520 --> 03:45:20.000]  pour drain cleaner in her eyes and the doctor said quote the ethics of whether it is okay to take a
[03:45:20.000 --> 03:45:24.720]  normal person and make them disabled i think you can make an ethical case that if you conceptualize
[03:45:24.720 --> 03:45:32.960]  this as treating a condition then it's okay to do it it's okay to get someone to pour drain cleaner
[03:45:32.960 --> 03:45:39.280]  in your eyes now of course in a sensible world this woman should be under you know psychiatric care
[03:45:39.280 --> 03:45:45.520]  the psychologist who poured drain cleaner in her eyes to blind her should be in prison but that's
[03:45:45.520 --> 03:45:51.520]  not how it's being treated dr michael first professor of clinical psychiatry at columbia
[03:45:51.520 --> 03:45:58.000]  university that was the voice you just heard saying it's okay for people to pour drain cleaner
[03:45:58.000 --> 03:46:05.280]  in their eyes that is the level of insanity that this has got to because she was born that way
[03:46:05.280 --> 03:46:10.480]  you know i'm not comparing directly transgender people but that was the same argument we heard
[03:46:11.120 --> 03:46:16.720]  and this is the way it's going we've talked about you know pedophile rights being increasingly
[03:46:16.720 --> 03:46:22.960]  mainstreamed and now they're talking about this woman being an inspiration i guess she's you know
[03:46:22.960 --> 03:46:29.280]  stunning and brave like katlyn jenna because she's such a great example for everyone else
[03:46:29.280 --> 03:46:34.160]  you know the people who like to hack off their penises because they feel they were born that way
[03:46:34.160 --> 03:46:40.160]  and that's their right to do it but don't make me pay for it with my tax money but obviously
[03:46:40.160 --> 03:46:46.400]  eventually through obama care you will be paying for this woman to be blind willingly through your
[03:46:46.400 --> 03:46:54.720]  tax money and again it's body integrity identity disorder this is a mental illness that now the
[03:46:54.720 --> 03:47:00.640]  media and if this doctor is to be believed the medical profession is increasingly starting to
[03:47:00.640 --> 03:47:08.080]  mainstream and make into some kind of social justice cause that because she was born wanting to be
[03:47:08.080 --> 03:47:14.080]  blind because she had this mental illness that now we should go around helping people to pour
[03:47:14.080 --> 03:47:21.040]  drain cleaner in their eyes how insane has this progressive disease got let's go to a call because
[03:47:22.240 --> 03:47:26.720]  dean's been waiting a while let's go to dean in north carolina you're on the air dean go ahead
[03:47:26.720 --> 03:47:37.440]  hello i'm first-time caller uh mr wassen i've seen your pee on uh blank the pope and i've seen
[03:47:37.440 --> 03:47:45.680]  alex's show on burning you uh i've been uh watching y'all for about six months i appreciate
[03:47:45.680 --> 03:47:53.600]  all your reporting and all you do for the american people uh yesterday i was watching the pee from
[03:47:53.600 --> 03:48:01.760]  chris and hall and she was talking about the u n they met yesterday and they were talking to all
[03:48:01.760 --> 03:48:09.360]  the mayors around the country and around the world about uh coming up with this thing called strong
[03:48:09.360 --> 03:48:15.440]  cities network and they said it was going to be to help the people but it's actually going to be the
[03:48:15.440 --> 03:48:24.960]  u n military rising the police and uh they say that they're going to put this thing in effect
[03:48:25.680 --> 03:48:33.680]  at their next meeting in spring and Paris france instead of the reason for doing this was uh they
[03:48:33.680 --> 03:48:39.920]  were going to stop the violent extremists well that sounds very interesting i'll definitely
[03:48:39.920 --> 03:48:45.040]  look into that we've had this call for the u n to come in you know under emergency situations
[03:48:45.040 --> 03:48:51.440]  the u s military actually now is more geared to occupying foreign cities so i guess in a case of
[03:48:51.440 --> 03:48:56.160]  you know martial law those resources might be drawn elsewhere to the point where you might
[03:48:56.160 --> 03:49:01.600]  have a u n peacekeeping force come in if you know there is a major natural disaster we've had
[03:49:01.600 --> 03:49:06.400]  you know henry kissin just talk about that at bilderberg events so i'll definitely look into that
[03:49:06.400 --> 03:49:09.920]  trash hauler in femur region nine you're on the air go ahead
[03:49:09.920 --> 03:49:17.200]  hey paul uh great to talk to you can you hear me okay yeah go ahead come in through clear
[03:49:17.840 --> 03:49:24.640]  okay uh here uh that was a great piece that you've been talking about that you did on
[03:49:25.280 --> 03:49:30.400]  people wanting to be trans abled and i got something i didn't really want to let this one
[03:49:30.400 --> 03:49:37.120]  out of the bag but um last time i called i um uh somebody checked down my number and said they
[03:49:37.120 --> 03:49:42.480]  were going to call me back and i kind of fell for that but anyways um maybe i can give you
[03:49:42.480 --> 03:49:50.480]  the idea on the air here it is you have kind of this crazy group of people that want to be
[03:49:50.480 --> 03:49:57.040]  trans abled they want it um they want a portrayal in their eyes they want their limbs cut off
[03:49:57.600 --> 03:50:03.120]  they want to be taken care of etc and then guess what we have this thing the other thing that's
[03:50:03.120 --> 03:50:11.200]  big is we have this thing called um the trans specific partnership you get that the trans
[03:50:11.200 --> 03:50:20.400]  specific partnership so the elite forces um somehow this could be part of a uh a big um
[03:50:21.280 --> 03:50:31.440]  media uh meme i think um i think certain elite forces want us to be basically trans abled
[03:50:31.440 --> 03:50:40.880]  and they're going about it by having this quote unquote trade agreement uh tgp tgip etc um
[03:50:42.240 --> 03:50:48.000]  how how about a story on that yeah i think we got a story up on that today actually i think
[03:50:48.000 --> 03:50:51.600]  curtain email wrote about it and it's next to you that we'll continue to cover but thanks

[03:54:44.640 --> 03:54:50.880]  have this out of campus reform ucsd says the term minorities is offensive tells students to say people
[03:54:50.880 --> 03:54:57.920]  of color so you can't work out you can't stay fit you can't say minorities you can't say mother and
[03:54:57.920 --> 03:55:04.080]  father you can't say children basically you can't do anything you can't say america that's offensive
[03:55:04.080 --> 03:55:10.640]  but you can't pour drain cleaner in your eyes that's trendy you can get up on salon dot com and say
[03:55:10.640 --> 03:55:16.720]  i'm a pedophile give me support and understanding and then when anyone criticizes a pedophile being
[03:55:16.720 --> 03:55:23.280]  given a platform they're hateful okay pedophilia is trendy pouring drain cleaner in your eyes is
[03:55:23.280 --> 03:55:29.360]  trendy peeing yourself and posting photos of it on twitter as feminists are now doing that's trendy
[03:55:29.360 --> 03:55:36.160]  but don't go and work out in the gym that's toxic masculinity this is the progressive hell hole
[03:55:36.160 --> 03:55:42.000]  that we now live in david night you've got some top stories coming up on info wars nightly news
[03:55:42.000 --> 03:55:46.960]  break it down for us yes paul we've got the trans-specific partnership has now been settled
[03:55:46.960 --> 03:55:51.280]  that's going to head the united states we've got the fight of our life in this and we're going to
[03:55:51.280 --> 03:55:55.440]  take a look at what this might mean because of course speaker bainer is stepping down are they
[03:55:55.440 --> 03:56:00.240]  going to fast track this through before he gets out another person has put his name into the hat
[03:56:00.240 --> 03:56:06.400]  to replace bainer and of course that's congressman chafee and chafee it's sorry from new mexico
[03:56:06.400 --> 03:56:11.840]  this is the same guy that the secret service was just trying to attack with information that
[03:56:11.840 --> 03:56:16.320]  they had on him when he was investigating their failures so this is an interesting development
[03:56:16.320 --> 03:56:21.520]  with that we're also going to be talking about uh what happened on saturday you know obama was
[03:56:21.520 --> 03:56:27.840]  using the shooting on thursday to attack guns in the second amendment and then on saturday there
[03:56:27.840 --> 03:56:34.320]  was a mass shooting a killing attacking a hospital this is a war crime this went on for 30 minutes
[03:56:34.320 --> 03:56:39.200]  after they were notified this is a very deliberate effect but there's more to it than that paul
[03:56:39.200 --> 03:56:44.560]  this also is about the unraveling of afghanistan just like we've seen in iraq that's what's
[03:56:44.560 --> 03:56:50.560]  essentially behind this attack in kunduz it's a desperate attack by the military to try to get
[03:56:50.560 --> 03:56:56.720]  control of that area they're losing control of afghanistan as well okay david that would be sure
[03:56:56.720 --> 03:57:01.920]  to tune in to the info wars nightly news again i just mentioned it let's just finish off with this
[03:57:02.880 --> 03:57:08.080]  and i don't know if i can say the word i'll say p for equality feminist call for fortune troll campaign
[03:57:08.080 --> 03:57:14.560]  fall for fortune troll campaign by peeing themselves they actually fell for this fortune troll campaign
[03:57:14.560 --> 03:57:21.920]  where they said hey let's make fun of feminist by saying p for equality to support rape victims
[03:57:21.920 --> 03:57:27.840]  and they actually got up and did it a bunch of feminists got on twitter and basically peed themselves
[03:57:27.840 --> 03:57:33.280]  and again this isn't the first time it's happened the free bleeding movement this is where women
[03:57:33.280 --> 03:57:39.760]  run marathons while on their period without wearing any kind of protection to fight the evil
[03:57:39.760 --> 03:57:46.480]  patriarchy and again that was a fortune campaign it was started as a troll campaign to make fun
[03:57:46.480 --> 03:57:52.080]  of feminist to say let's get them to do this to make themselves look ridiculous and they actually
[03:57:52.080 --> 03:57:58.880]  did it and now they've repeated the trick where and granted it's only a few feminists are getting
[03:57:58.880 --> 03:58:05.360]  up on twitter posting pictures of themselves peeing their pants to support rape victims again
[03:58:05.360 --> 03:58:11.120]  underscoring illustrating the fact that these social justice warriors are so gullible that they'll
[03:58:11.120 --> 03:58:17.840]  basically fall for absolutely everything so long as it's done in the name of feminism in the name
[03:58:17.840 --> 03:58:24.880]  of supporting this rape culture myth which doesn't exist that's going to wrap it up for the alex jump
