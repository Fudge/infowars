[01:05.320 --> 01:13.720]  camps he was aware of the gun confiscation legislation now introduced and much of
[01:13.720 --> 01:17.680]  that wording is in these different bills it was seven states than eight states
[01:17.680 --> 01:25.000]  now ten states have bills introduced or have past bills and Oklahoma is one of

[01:47.200 --> 01:50.320]  multi-thousand page pork barrel nightmare but it's more than just pork
[01:50.320 --> 01:54.840]  barrel far worse than that rationing health care to seniors and other things

[02:00.400 --> 02:06.600]  track the armada of gun banning gun restricting gun registering bills and
[02:06.600 --> 02:10.880]  legislation and executive fiat announcements about the AG being able to
[02:10.880 --> 02:21.760]  ban any guns he wants just simply by announcing it we'll also get into the
[02:21.760 --> 02:24.360]  fact that they're saying they're gonna put more more gun owners on a quote no
[02:24.360 --> 02:29.720]  fly list which will also be a no buy a gun list this is gonna expand you haven't
[02:29.720 --> 02:32.880]  paid your taxes when they claim you haven't paid your taxes they're just

[02:45.880 --> 02:54.760]  then again in the fourth hour wide-open phones yet again okay I have scanned
[02:54.760 --> 02:58.880]  over the different versions of the stimulus package the latest version of
[02:58.880 --> 03:04.680]  the stimulus package that has passed the house is awaiting approval on the
[03:04.680 --> 03:13.080]  Senate openly states that doctors will not be allowed to practice medicine
[03:13.080 --> 03:16.680]  anymore now they've already been moving towards this where doctors dentists and
[03:16.680 --> 03:21.440]  others if someone is paying with insurance or if someone is on Medicare
[03:21.440 --> 03:26.880]  Medicaid the doctor has to go through protocols that are all computerized
[03:26.880 --> 03:31.520]  written by the government the insurance companies and the HMOs to decide what
[03:31.520 --> 03:36.160]  care they can meet out and so oh you've got a bunch of ruptured disc from a car
[03:36.160 --> 03:41.480]  wreck we'll put you on Prozac that's what they do now or oh you've got well let
[03:41.480 --> 03:44.360]  me take England and I've watched the House of Commons I remember seeing Tony
[03:44.360 --> 03:50.240]  Blair admitted 18 months for brain surgery on operable brain cancer but
[03:50.240 --> 03:55.040]  you've got to get it quick and you know you're talking over a 90% survival rate
[03:55.040 --> 03:59.440]  but they just say no you got to wait 18 months and they look at your age if you're
[03:59.440 --> 04:04.960]  above 55 that means you've almost finished your usefulness you are not
[04:04.960 --> 04:10.360]  given the surgery this is the rationing of healthcare and all you fools that said
[04:10.360 --> 04:16.480]  you wanted this you're going to get it now you're going to get it and if you've
[04:16.480 --> 04:19.560]  even got the money for health care and have to go to another nation but in this
[04:19.560 --> 04:22.280]  global system they're shutting down more and more places where you can get
[04:22.280 --> 04:24.960]  health care but they'll always be places you can get it because all the
[04:24.960 --> 04:28.360]  globalists have to be able to get health care so they'll jump on their private
[04:28.360 --> 04:35.240]  jets and fly out and do it this is eugenics it is in the legislation also
[04:35.240 --> 04:40.840]  Art Acevedo what a piece of work man he's joined six other Texas police chiefs
[04:40.840 --> 04:46.520]  wanting them to take DNA when you're arrested he is a bloodsucker I'm gonna
[04:46.520 --> 04:50.960]  call him up and tell him he's a bloodsucker got his cell phone number
[04:50.960 --> 04:56.080]  he is just a real piece of work yeah that's right DNA databases but hey what's
[04:56.080 --> 05:01.840]  the big deal we're all in one at birth anyways have you ever wanted to generate

[05:14.160 --> 05:17.520]  emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you
[05:17.520 --> 05:22.200]  need it most unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly emits no
[05:22.200 --> 05:25.880]  fumes and produces electricity for free it's like having an electric power

[08:38.520 --> 08:48.840]  stimulus package and it states well I mean not just the bill this is a quote
[08:48.840 --> 08:56.280]  from Dashiell who's running around promoting and I I guess is a outside
[08:56.280 --> 09:00.160]  the administration minion Dashiell says health care reform will not be paying
[09:00.160 --> 09:04.120]  free seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age
[09:04.120 --> 09:08.600]  instead of treating them did you hear that yeah you're not spoke you're supposed
[09:08.600 --> 09:14.760]  to die you know I keep saying on air over and over again eugenics eugenics
[09:14.760 --> 09:22.360]  eugenics eugenics eugenics eugenics understand that word understand all
[09:22.360 --> 09:29.700]  it's a keyword eugenics eugenics eugenics why are they giving girls
[09:29.700 --> 09:35.080]  Gardasil shots they know are attacking the reproductive organs killing them
[09:35.080 --> 09:40.480]  maiming them in mass eugenics eugenics why does bear pharmaceutical ship out
[09:40.480 --> 09:45.840]  over a million injections of HIV and hepatitis filled factor 8 knowing it's
[09:45.840 --> 09:50.040]  going to kill everybody that takes it eugenics eugenics eugenics eugenics
[09:50.040 --> 09:53.560]  what's the whole purpose of the world government why do these guys work so
[09:53.560 --> 09:59.160]  hard for it not just about power it's about eugenics eugenics eugenics eugenics
[09:59.160 --> 10:03.720]  you better find out what it means I know a lot of you know but a lot of you
[10:03.720 --> 10:06.320]  don't and that you're certainly your neighbors your friends your families
[10:06.320 --> 10:11.440]  don't know that's why Obama keeps saying you're going to have to make
[10:11.440 --> 10:16.800]  sacrifices this is going to be austerity this is going to be hard this is going
[10:16.800 --> 10:25.360]  to be tough unless you're one of the banker CEOs of their shareholders
[10:25.360 --> 10:31.640]  making trillions not billions dashel says health care reform will not be
[10:31.640 --> 10:35.360]  pain-free senators should be more accepting of the conditions that come
[10:35.360 --> 10:41.680]  with age instead of treating them that means the elderly will bear the brunt
[10:42.880 --> 10:47.440]  and it goes on from there Medicare now pays for treatment steams safe and
[10:47.440 --> 10:50.800]  effective the stimulus bill would change that and apply a cost effectiveness
[10:50.800 --> 10:59.680]  standard set by the federal council section 464 the federal council is
[10:59.680 --> 11:04.600]  modeled after the UK board based in dashel's book the board approves of
[11:04.600 --> 11:08.160]  rejects treatments using a formula that divides the cost of treatment by the
[11:08.160 --> 11:13.920]  number of years the patient is likely to benefit tens of thousands of people
[11:13.920 --> 11:16.800]  with brain tumors alone that were completely operable could have been
[11:16.800 --> 11:22.800]  fixed they said sorry if you're still alive in 18 months when most of you
[11:22.800 --> 11:30.360]  will die then we might do the brain surgery oh you've got skin cancer sorry

[13:37.240 --> 13:44.320]  things are and stop living in denial newsweek has the cover story we are all
[13:44.320 --> 13:49.720]  socialists now with the republicans and democrats shaking hands the image of
[13:49.720 --> 13:53.800]  the red states and blue states they offer socialism as the solution and says
[13:53.800 --> 13:58.680]  it's needed and it says you're all gonna have your own little debit card that the
[13:58.680 --> 14:03.360]  government puts your monthly credits on see they want to bankrupt things so bad
[14:03.360 --> 14:09.080]  that 90% of us will be on welfare and with that comes government controlled
[14:09.080 --> 14:16.960]  rationing then not just rationing eugenics oh your credit card statement
[14:16.960 --> 14:22.160]  the government has access to shows you buy wine every week well sorry you've
[14:22.160 --> 14:27.040]  got heart disease and liver disease you don't get health care in England they

[14:38.080 --> 14:41.920]  cancer you don't get treatment see this is what the socialism is all about is
[14:41.920 --> 14:47.920]  about controlling and ration rationing things the globalist want neo feudalism
[14:47.920 --> 14:52.120]  there's plenty of resources there's plenty of money to go around it's a high
[14:52.120 --> 14:56.640]  tech economy we've built this incredibly advanced technological system all of our
[14:56.640 --> 15:00.160]  standard of living should be rapidly rising but if you read the eugenicist
[15:00.160 --> 15:05.440]  documents the world population reduction documents the PDD's the state
[15:05.440 --> 15:09.000]  department random 200 the royal commission on population the club of
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.880]  Rome the United Nations biological diversity assessment they say world
[15:12.880 --> 15:17.600]  government is about artificially restricting your access to a high
[15:17.600 --> 15:24.520]  standard of living and then they make it fashionable and cool see first they
[15:24.520 --> 15:27.520]  sell you and getting rid of the old people saying well they have a right to
[15:27.520 --> 15:31.960]  die with dignity and they'll cut to some person and 75 years old excruciating
[15:31.960 --> 15:37.920]  pain saying I deserve to be able to commit suicide hey bubble nobody's
[15:37.920 --> 15:40.560]  stopping you from going to the dentist have a tooth pulled and getting a whole
[15:40.560 --> 15:47.640]  bottle of hydrocodone and going home and turning your lights out see what they
[15:47.640 --> 15:58.160]  claim oh they can't get access to suicide oh if you can't go in the kitchen and
[15:58.160 --> 16:02.360]  turn the gas on if you can't go in the garage and close it and turn the car on
[16:02.360 --> 16:11.360]  shut up you want to kill yourself go ahead the whole point here is that they
[16:11.360 --> 16:15.440]  want to pass a law saying the government decides when to kill us through their
[16:15.440 --> 16:23.360]  bioethesis boards that is neo eugenics and they've openly introduced it they've
[16:23.360 --> 16:27.560]  got the bill in there as health care helping you and that folks I can't even
[16:27.560 --> 16:30.160]  read the whole bill it's thousands thousands page they're constantly
[16:30.160 --> 16:37.760]  cramming new stuff in and they say to the states oh you're having trouble with
[16:37.760 --> 16:41.400]  money you just got a federalized completely your hospital and carry out
[16:41.400 --> 16:45.160]  our bioethesis system and put in our computers as if they don't already have
[16:45.160 --> 16:50.760]  it and just trying to cover this I mean what is eugenics you go to have your
[16:50.760 --> 16:56.840]  baby at the hospital the nurse sits there and ask your wife right in front of
[16:56.840 --> 17:00.480]  you do you have any problems at home and she'll say oh sir will you go file this
[17:00.480 --> 17:04.440]  take this to the nurse downstairs for me and then as soon as you leave the room
[17:04.440 --> 17:09.240]  this is how they do it they go do you feel safe at home you got enough money
[17:09.240 --> 17:13.360]  our bills tough and there's the trusting woman sitting there about to have her
[17:13.360 --> 17:18.320]  baby you know she's going into labor and the nurse is smiling honey you need a
[17:18.320 --> 17:23.080]  cup of water and then she's putting in the in the computer and if you say
[17:23.080 --> 17:27.240]  you're having money troubles they come snatch your children
[17:32.200 --> 17:37.160]  by the grace of God though the CPS is huge but they're usually so busy
[17:37.160 --> 17:39.840]  kidnapping other kids that a lot of times they can't show up to kidnap yours
[17:39.840 --> 17:44.000]  even if you answered the questions wrong not knowing that you are literally
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.640]  before an inquisitor putting all your data in the health department that was
[17:47.640 --> 17:51.040]  chartered under eugenics and it's going into a national and international
[17:51.040 --> 17:56.840]  database the nurse doesn't tell you they're taking your baby's blood that's
[17:56.840 --> 18:05.840]  going into a global database for 36 years 35 years illegally so here we are
[18:05.840 --> 18:10.240]  we are going into the control grid and with it comes the face-scanning cameras
[18:10.240 --> 18:13.040]  the secret police all over England now if you're at the park or walking on the
[18:13.040 --> 18:16.760]  street it's happened to me but not just me I watch him walking up to mainly
[18:16.760 --> 18:23.200]  clean-cut good-looking families they leave all the people that the public's
[18:23.200 --> 18:26.920]  told this is for the illegal aliens the foreigners alone and they just come up
[18:26.920 --> 18:31.320]  and say I need you to stand right here please name and ID this is a security
[18:31.320 --> 18:36.960]  check what's this about I will have you detained and arrested if you do not
[18:36.960 --> 18:42.120]  answer the questions immediately what are you doing just to train you to live
[18:42.120 --> 18:51.440]  under this total control we're being inducted into slavery but just in the
[18:51.440 --> 18:56.200]  area of health care the federal council's model after the UK board discussed
[18:56.200 --> 18:59.920]  in Daschle's book the board approves or rejects treatments using a formal that
[18:59.920 --> 19:03.160]  divides the cost of treatment by the number of years the patient is likely
[19:03.160 --> 19:06.760]  to benefit treatments for younger patients are more often approved than
[19:06.760 --> 19:11.680]  treatments for diseases that affect the elderly such as osteoporosis now again
[19:11.680 --> 19:14.560]  even if you've got money you're not gonna be getting the health care under
[19:14.560 --> 19:19.800]  this in 2006 a UK health board decreed that elderly patients with macular
[19:19.800 --> 19:24.320]  degeneration had to wait until they went blind in one eye before they could get
[19:24.320 --> 19:29.880]  a costly new drug to save the other eye it took almost three years of public
[19:29.880 --> 19:33.000]  protest before the board reverses decision but they still selectively don't
[19:33.000 --> 19:36.440]  do it I watch House of Commons every week where they had I need Paul Watson
[19:36.440 --> 19:40.440]  because he's closer to this or Steve do an article for folks off of this do it

[24:53.640 --> 24:57.000]  old people you don't want people that made bad decisions in life you don't
[24:57.000 --> 25:01.120]  want to in the introduces to the public of well should some alcoholic get a new
[25:01.120 --> 25:06.720]  liver or should a baby that's how they've introduced the idea but no it's for
[25:06.720 --> 25:11.320]  everybody and that's in the bill that's in the stimulus package above 55 you
[25:11.320 --> 25:18.640]  wait for health care and it's all based on the British system everything that is
[25:18.640 --> 25:23.080]  the key country they're about three or four years ahead of what the u.s. is in
[25:23.080 --> 25:29.080]  every respect they train the children all their schools it's now started in the
[25:29.080 --> 25:33.720]  u.s. to spy on their parents they secretly have them thumb scan and put them
[25:33.720 --> 25:36.200]  in DNA databases without telling the parents that's come out in the news
[25:36.200 --> 25:39.640]  same thing starting here if the Obama administration economics stimulus bill
[25:39.640 --> 25:44.160]  passes a Senate in its current form senators in the u.s. will face similar
[25:44.160 --> 25:48.040]  rationing defenders of the system say that individuals benefit in younger
[25:48.040 --> 25:54.720]  years and sacrifice later yeah when you pay all your taxes into the system the
[25:54.720 --> 25:58.240]  stimulus bill will affect every part of the health care for medical and nursing
[25:58.240 --> 26:03.080]  education to help patients are treated and how much hospitals get paid the
[26:03.080 --> 26:06.600]  bill allocates more funding for this bureaucracy that the Army Navy Marines
[26:06.600 --> 26:14.680]  and the Air Force combined page 9092 17417718181 this is Bloomberg hiding
[26:14.680 --> 26:18.400]  health legislation the stimulus bill is intentional dash will support the
[26:18.400 --> 26:22.080]  Clinton administration's health care overall and 94 and he's one that wrote
[26:22.080 --> 26:26.400]  this previously in the Senate was attributed in failure to debate and
[26:26.400 --> 26:30.240]  delay a year ago dash will wrote that the next president could act quickly
[26:30.240 --> 26:34.080]  before critics amounted opposition that means attaching a health care plan to
[26:34.080 --> 26:37.760]  the federal budget so be it he said the issue was too important to be stalled
[26:37.760 --> 26:45.080]  by Senate protocol more scrutiny needed president Obama's called it an
[26:45.080 --> 26:49.560]  excusable and irresponsible for senators to delay passing the stimulus bill and
[26:49.560 --> 26:53.480]  truth bill needs more scrutiny because it isn't a stimulus bill it's a federal
[26:53.480 --> 26:57.120]  takeover the health care industry is the largest employer in the u.s. produces
[26:57.120 --> 27:01.080]  some 17% of the nation's gross domestic product if the bill treats health care
[27:01.080 --> 27:05.160]  the way the European government does as a cost problem instead of a growth
[27:05.160 --> 27:09.320]  industry imagine limiting growth and innovation and the electronics or auto
[27:09.320 --> 27:12.640]  industry during this downturn the stimulus is dangerous to your health
[27:12.640 --> 27:17.960]  and the economy Betsy McCauley is former lieutenant governor in New York as an
[27:17.960 --> 27:21.880]  adjunct senior fellow at the Hudson Institute now let's read from the front
[27:21.880 --> 27:28.720]  page because that's not all they make doctors and dentists and others if
[27:28.720 --> 27:34.640]  somebody's got insurance hmo Medicare and Medicaid that's why Ron Paul and his
[27:34.640 --> 27:39.320]  private practice and many others that have private practices do not accept
[27:39.320 --> 27:43.440]  Medicare Medicaid or insurance you got to pay cash because if you do accept that
[27:43.440 --> 27:50.040]  now they want to make it for everybody even if you do pay cash they make you
[27:51.040 --> 27:53.920]  follow my dad's an oral surgeon and dentists are now making them do this
[27:53.920 --> 28:01.200]  upload everything into a computer database and then the hmo's and the
[28:01.200 --> 28:05.640]  insurance companies then tell them what treatment they can carry out when they
[28:05.640 --> 28:09.920]  don't even have medical degrees I'll get my dad in here because he's actually
[28:09.920 --> 28:13.120]  written letters to the state of Texas they've had hearings over it he's
[28:13.120 --> 28:16.400]  actually helped stop some of this just with a few letters and phone calls
[28:16.400 --> 28:22.400]  pointing out it's illegal still under Texas law to do this I was supposed to
[28:22.400 --> 28:26.560]  be talking about this he never told me not to the point is is that in my own
[28:26.560 --> 28:31.840]  life I'm hearing about this where they are telling people what to do a
[28:31.840 --> 28:39.080]  computer program does do you understand that the doctors are being turned into
[28:39.080 --> 28:42.960]  technicians that the medical practitioners are being turned into
[28:42.960 --> 28:47.280]  technicians that the nurses are being turned into technicians who follow what
[28:47.280 --> 28:52.840]  the computer says and this goes into the Patriot Act too I mean it's just it's
[28:52.840 --> 28:56.720]  over everything cars you buy houses you buy your health care in bank accounts
[28:56.720 --> 29:05.040]  it's all controlled Republican senators are questioning whether present
[29:05.040 --> 29:08.560]  Barack Obama stimulus bill contains the right mix of tax breaks cash infusions
[29:08.560 --> 29:11.720]  jumpstart economy tragically no one me either party is objecting to the health
[29:11.720 --> 29:15.120]  provisions slipped in without discussion these provisions reflect the
[29:15.120 --> 29:19.120]  handiwork of Tom Dashel's recently the nominee to the Health and Human Services
[29:19.120 --> 29:24.480]  Department that's why they rush it and say this will go from a crisis to a
[29:24.480 --> 29:30.160]  catastrophe pass it now don't read it pass it now and every day they change it
[29:30.160 --> 29:35.280]  no just pass it now pass it pass it now pass it now pass it now pass it pass it

[34:05.040 --> 34:09.800]  anything as if that's bad enough they're handing it over to private offshore
[34:09.800 --> 34:16.480]  multinational interest they're bringing in eugenics the people over 55 are gonna
[34:16.480 --> 34:20.840]  have health care rationed it's actually in the bill they say it in their own
[34:20.840 --> 34:26.200]  words are not even denying it now they are making their move we're gonna go
[34:26.200 --> 34:31.600]  over the story next hour we're all socialists now out of newsweek I'm also
[34:31.600 --> 34:35.160]  going to get into all over the nation police are just pulling people over
[34:35.160 --> 34:41.920]  taking their wallets their watches any cash and even the san antonio express
[34:41.920 --> 34:47.320]  news calls it piracy the society is imploding through corruption but there's
[34:47.320 --> 34:51.760]  still good people in the country in government and in the private sector
[34:51.760 --> 34:56.160]  yesterday I had a state rep on from washington state who's introduced
[34:56.160 --> 34:59.680]  legislation he was aware of the FEMA camps he was aware that they have
[34:59.680 --> 35:04.520]  clergy response teams out on the payroll of FEMA telling their flocks to go into
[35:04.520 --> 35:08.560]  FEMA camps Obama is now announcing a nationwide initiative with this is no
[35:08.560 --> 35:14.720]  longer secret new hampshire and it's now ten states it was seven eight seven or
[35:14.720 --> 35:17.680]  eight states last friday when curtain emma wrote a story about it it's now ten
[35:17.680 --> 35:23.320]  states Oklahoma is one of the few states actually passed this legislation
[35:23.320 --> 35:26.600]  declaring sovereignty against the feds and listing they won't accept gun
[35:26.600 --> 35:34.520]  confiscation they won't accept martial law I went over hcr six out of New
[35:34.520 --> 35:38.560]  Hampshire has a very good chance of passing saying that they will resist the
[35:38.560 --> 35:43.400]  establishment of martial law in article one article two they will resist
[35:43.400 --> 35:50.480]  requiring involuntary servitude all being announced it goes on and on from
[35:50.480 --> 35:55.120]  there so I wanted to get state rep Charles key on the show all this week and
[35:55.120 --> 36:00.120]  next week we've got new hampshire state reps on friday two of them all this
[36:00.120 --> 36:05.280]  week we're gonna have state reps on who are valiantly fighting the globalist
[36:05.280 --> 36:09.240]  it is now openly announced world government is taking over they're
[36:09.240 --> 36:12.080]  making their move I got home last night my wife said oh my gosh I was just
[36:12.080 --> 36:15.560]  listening to npr cooking dinner and they announced that it's global government
[36:15.560 --> 36:19.840]  it's globalism it's wonderful everybody's accepting the new global order the
[36:19.840 --> 36:25.160]  crisis is helping rama manual saying the crisis is helping they can't let this
[36:25.160 --> 36:29.360]  crisis go to waste I mean they're all but admitting they engineered it and their
[36:29.360 --> 36:33.320]  own document show they did so this is the great time of the new world order
[36:33.320 --> 36:39.960]  folks and with it becomes abject slavery they've introduced total gun ban
[36:39.960 --> 36:43.840]  bills where the they're they're seeing by executive fiat they'll put everybody
[36:43.840 --> 36:48.600]  on no fly list and no buy gun list a blacklist with no judge or jury they
[36:48.600 --> 36:53.720]  just do it this is unspeakable national gun registration it's all introduced
[36:53.720 --> 36:59.240]  it's all happening right now and all we see is Obama saying this will go from a
[36:59.240 --> 37:03.720]  crisis to a catastrophe you must pass it now and the bill grows by thousands of
[37:03.720 --> 37:10.240]  pages every day and in there in their own words it says 55 or older you don't
[37:10.240 --> 37:13.960]  get health care before they would deny they wanted rationing now they just say
[37:13.960 --> 37:21.560]  it state rep charles key why do you think they're just becoming so open well
[37:21.560 --> 37:25.760]  because they haven't well it's like we had you open this segment of your show
[37:25.760 --> 37:31.880]  Alex that we are overcoming we're trying to overcome decades of indoctrination
[37:31.880 --> 37:37.120]  and brainwashing they've been effective in doing that and they've warned people
[37:37.120 --> 37:41.120]  down and they've brought up a generation or so that a large number of those
[37:41.120 --> 37:46.640]  people think this is the way it is and so they're getting pretty arrogant and
[37:46.640 --> 37:50.960]  cocky about it they see the possibility of having the success and and
[37:50.960 --> 37:55.720]  accomplishing their goals I think they're arrogant because they're planning
[37:55.720 --> 37:59.920]  huge false flag terror attacks and if you look at their body language and the
[37:59.920 --> 38:04.000]  things they're saying the last time they said this was before 9-11 and the time
[38:04.000 --> 38:08.080]  before that it was right before Oklahoma City which of course you spearheaded
[38:08.080 --> 38:12.560]  exposing as an inside job does your gut tell you they're getting ready to false
[38:12.560 --> 38:17.840]  flag nothing would surprise me anymore Alex I tell you I don't think there's
[38:17.840 --> 38:23.080]  many things that we could put past a lot of these people it's just it's amazing
[38:23.080 --> 38:27.400]  what they will do and what they have done so far they have engineered this
[38:27.400 --> 38:31.200]  because of their own policies and the things they've done they've engineered
[38:31.200 --> 38:36.640]  the problems that we have today both economically and physically and it
[38:36.640 --> 38:41.880]  otherwise regarding the constitutional freedoms civil liberties that we have you
[38:41.880 --> 38:45.520]  know they continue to cause the problem they come back with a bledged answer
[38:45.520 --> 38:49.840]  supposed answers to it their solutions and they just take more freedoms away
[38:49.840 --> 38:54.280]  and take more of our property and our wealth away from us it is time the people
[38:54.280 --> 39:00.840]  stand up you know what amazes me is how so few number of people can bring under
[39:00.840 --> 39:04.600]  submission or almost bring under submission a nation of over 300 million
[39:04.600 --> 39:08.960]  people it's really amazing that we're allowing this to happen and all we have
[39:08.960 --> 39:12.360]  to do is stand up we don't have to have a violent revolution or anything we just
[39:12.360 --> 39:17.720]  need to stand up and take back control well I'll tell you how they're doing and
[39:17.720 --> 39:26.080]  it's television which is admittedly a mind control device and they have dumb
[39:26.080 --> 39:31.560]  the public down so far and they've used all these crises they've created to try
[39:31.560 --> 39:37.720]  to shell the public but even though in every major poll 98% in major polls
[39:37.720 --> 39:41.600]  thousand to one phone calls in Congress against the last maker takeover many
[39:41.600 --> 39:44.480]  polls are as high as 70% against this one even though it's tailored as
[39:44.480 --> 39:49.680]  supposedly a bailout for the people when it's not federal takeover this for
[39:49.680 --> 39:53.480]  for folks that don't know if you've studied history I want your take on this
[39:53.480 --> 40:01.400]  representative Charles key a Republican from Oklahoma this this isn't just some
[40:01.400 --> 40:08.960]  big government takeover this mirrors on a mix of Stalinist Maoist Nazi systems
[40:08.960 --> 40:12.440]  even the Washington Post admits that that that but they say it's a good thing
[40:12.440 --> 40:18.040]  that this you know looks like the classic mass movements of the past I mean
[40:18.040 --> 40:24.480]  this is as bad as it gets can you speak to that well I don't disagree with that
[40:24.480 --> 40:28.640]  you know it's the frog getting boiled slowly in the pot of water and we have
[40:28.640 --> 40:34.520]  to face up to that and realize it we have to lose our illusions about you know
[40:34.520 --> 40:38.560]  what this country being the country that we many of us were raised in or what it
[40:38.560 --> 40:44.080]  used to be it's not that right now but it is slowly transforming we've gone down
[40:44.080 --> 40:49.480]  the road quite a bit and they continue to use the propaganda tools that they
[40:49.480 --> 40:53.680]  can use and the various you know instruments and institutions that they
[40:53.680 --> 40:58.320]  can use in our culture and society to get people to think the way they want
[40:58.320 --> 41:02.560]  them to think and to get them to get us to move down the road where they want
[41:02.560 --> 41:09.160]  us but we have to face up to the facts and the facts are very clear if we don't
[41:09.160 --> 41:15.480]  turn this around if we don't have the personal and corporate fortitude to
[41:15.480 --> 41:20.120]  stand up and fight this then we can know where we're going to end up because
[41:20.120 --> 41:23.880]  it's the same thing that's happened throughout history they are many of them
[41:23.880 --> 41:28.160]  that are doing this but they also have to depend on a lot of people just standing
[41:28.160 --> 41:32.520]  by and watching it happen either out of fear or they're just you know covering
[41:32.520 --> 41:36.320]  their own backside well I agree with you I mean not just on the ground and doing
[41:36.320 --> 41:41.720]  thousands radio interviews myself and traveling the country in the world that
[41:41.720 --> 41:45.720]  it's people standing down most people know we're in trouble they're freaked
[41:45.720 --> 41:50.360]  out they're upset they know that criminals have taken control of both
[41:50.360 --> 41:54.760]  major parties and they know the new world order is real now it's all over the
[41:54.760 --> 41:58.640]  news as they try to sell it they are afraid or they don't have enough respect
[41:58.640 --> 42:02.640]  for themselves to believe they can fight back but if you really study the
[42:02.640 --> 42:07.200]  success you've had I've had many others have had if we just fight back we can
[42:07.200 --> 42:11.120]  stop them it's just too many people are sitting by and counting on those of us
[42:11.120 --> 42:14.880]  in the front lines to keep carrying the song they don't realize we need them to
[42:14.880 --> 42:19.680]  join us in the front lines not behind us but right beside us and there is a
[42:19.680 --> 42:24.960]  major ray of sunshine here there's many rays of sunshine the biggest one
[42:24.960 --> 42:28.760]  obviously is that Oklahoma passed a resolution saying we're not gonna allow
[42:28.760 --> 42:33.520]  you and takeovers and gun confiscation and you in and all this and then the
[42:33.520 --> 42:37.600]  feds bombs you to teach you to love them to teach you that they're the savior
[42:37.600 --> 42:45.600]  with Oklahoma City that you've exposed now we've got it's 10 states now it's
[42:45.600 --> 42:49.720]  grown three more since last week introducing bills to say no to the
[42:49.720 --> 42:53.560]  feds and in there I'm sure you've had a chance to read over some of the others
[42:53.560 --> 42:56.560]  it's saying we're not gonna put up with martial law we're not put up with gun
[42:56.560 --> 43:02.600]  confiscation we're gonna instruct our state police to resist can you speak to
[43:02.600 --> 43:06.720]  what Oklahoma did and I really think that's the model that we now see
[43:06.720 --> 43:11.320]  expanding around the country well I do think we're the model and I'm proud of
[43:11.320 --> 43:14.920]  what we've done with the 10th Amendment resolution we did pass it in the house
[43:14.920 --> 43:19.600]  last year I've refiled it this year it's gonna be heard in committee tomorrow
[43:19.600 --> 43:24.320]  it'll pass and Oklahoma took over the the Oklahoma Republican Party took over
[43:24.320 --> 43:27.720]  the Senate the state of Oklahoma for the first time in history so now we have
[43:27.720 --> 43:31.320]  control of the Senate and I feel very confident we're gonna pass it out of the
[43:31.320 --> 43:36.000]  Senate very soon and it will be the first one I believe that will have passed
[43:36.000 --> 43:42.040]  in both bodies in a state we didn't pass last year because the Democrats had a
[43:42.040 --> 43:46.240]  little bit more control in a in a split body in the Senate and they had a
[43:46.240 --> 43:49.760]  sharing agreement so as a Democratic Senator refused to let it be and get a
[43:49.760 --> 43:57.160]  hearing we're gonna fix that this year but you know the the problem is that you
[43:57.160 --> 44:03.240]  know we do we've got a lot of problems that we're trying to overcome and you
[44:03.240 --> 44:06.120]  know one of the other things that Oklahoma did trying to think of which
[44:06.120 --> 44:09.920]  ones to talk about first Alex and one of the things Oklahoma did and I'm proud
[44:09.920 --> 44:13.840]  of us here in Oklahoma just to kind of toot our horn a little bit we passed the
[44:13.840 --> 44:18.880]  bill in 2007 that said we will not participate as a state in the real ID
[44:18.880 --> 44:24.920]  Act well I'm real proud of Oklahoma for being either the first or one of the
[44:24.920 --> 44:28.480]  first states to actually pass legislation that said we will not do this
[44:28.480 --> 44:33.560]  and state agencies are not to comply with it we came back in 2008 with
[44:33.560 --> 44:38.120]  additional legislation myself and Senator Brogdon in Oklahoma State
[44:38.120 --> 44:42.880]  Senate and some other legislators trying to pass legislation to further tie down
[44:42.880 --> 44:49.160]  the state agencies from sharing information with of our citizens with
[44:49.160 --> 44:53.400]  any organization the feds or any other international organization whether
[44:53.400 --> 44:56.560]  that be biometric social security numbers a number of other things well what
[44:56.560 --> 45:00.040]  we had happened is that we had the federal Homeland Security start
[45:00.040 --> 45:04.360]  interjecting themselves behind the scenes we found this out as a fact we then
[45:04.360 --> 45:09.320]  had our own Department of Public Safety come in and start lobbying against us
[45:09.320 --> 45:14.720]  against my bills over in the house and really take me off we had a bunch of
[45:14.720 --> 45:20.960]  powerhouse with the head of the DPS in Oklahoma and his lobbyist and they
[45:20.960 --> 45:24.520]  continued to try to kill our legislation behind the scenes and frankly they were
[45:24.520 --> 45:28.640]  successful to hold it back well we've come back this year with some additional
[45:28.640 --> 45:34.720]  legislation and we're trying to further tie the hands of anyone that wants to do
[45:34.720 --> 45:39.920]  you know do the bidding of the federal government the federal Homeland Security
[45:39.920 --> 45:44.440]  or anyone else well representative chilly as you and so well as you know they
[45:44.440 --> 45:50.280]  have now openly announced North com runs the US under PDD 50 under PDD 51 they
[45:50.280 --> 45:54.240]  tell the governors that they serve at the pleasure of the president they're now
[45:54.240 --> 45:59.600]  dual-headed federal officers this is martial law that's basically what we're
[45:59.600 --> 46:03.800]  under now and of course the state police were chartered by Roosevelt during the
[46:03.800 --> 46:07.760]  Depression they're really federal I mean under the state charters they're there
[46:07.760 --> 46:12.680]  but they were really set up by the feds and so the state needs to remove the DPS
[46:12.680 --> 46:16.280]  director Department of Public Safety director if they don't do what the
[46:16.280 --> 46:22.280]  legislature says so I just love how you're standing up for the Tenth
[46:22.280 --> 46:29.960]  Amendment here expanding out on that as this crisis deepens we know the states
[46:29.960 --> 46:35.760]  are going to be the main bulwark against globalism to explain it to people the
[46:35.760 --> 46:38.840]  internationalists have taken over our federal government so this is even a
[46:38.840 --> 46:43.560]  question of fighting the feds they're now globalist they're now fully under
[46:43.560 --> 46:48.040]  international treaties and control they're illegitimate we must declare
[46:48.040 --> 46:51.480]  sovereignty at the state level and that's why if you look at what North com
[46:51.480 --> 46:56.480]  and the John Warner Defense Authorization Act and PDD 51 state it's all
[46:56.480 --> 47:03.080]  about using 20,000 U.S. Homeland Security Brigade Army troops against the
[47:03.080 --> 47:09.800]  states a how aware of this are you representative key B what is the sense
[47:09.800 --> 47:14.640]  of the legislature are they finally starting to realize that this is real
[47:14.640 --> 47:19.640]  this is really happening well yeah that reminds me the story I was gonna tell
[47:19.640 --> 47:23.080]  as we've been talking here last year I started telling those stories about real
[47:23.080 --> 47:28.600]  ID because of this one story I want to tell after 2007 we passed the bill that
[47:28.600 --> 47:33.200]  rejected real ID in Oklahoma then in 2008 I had the 10th member resolution in
[47:33.200 --> 47:38.520]  additional real ID legislation well the Oklahoma Republican Party has taken over
[47:38.520 --> 47:42.680]  the house here in Oklahoma the last few years so I'm on the house floor last
[47:42.680 --> 47:49.120]  year I'm on the Democratic side of the floor working these bills and I'm
[47:49.120 --> 47:54.320]  having conversations with primarily Democratic legislators we're talking
[47:54.320 --> 47:59.640]  about both of these issues and so some of the Democratic legislators speak up
[47:59.640 --> 48:03.600]  and they say well keep they say things to this effect almost exactly what I'm
[48:03.600 --> 48:07.560]  getting ready to tell you they say well key things are getting so bad that we
[48:07.560 --> 48:10.800]  think it's probably going to take an armed revolution for people you know
[48:10.800 --> 48:15.640]  before we turn it around blah blah blah blah blah well that really got my
[48:15.640 --> 48:19.840]  attention just like when I ran for reelect for office again in 06 when I
[48:19.840 --> 48:25.000]  went door-to-door and heard so many people in my district saying similar
[48:25.000 --> 48:29.880]  kinds of things about that indicated their level of knowledge at their level
[48:29.880 --> 48:33.680]  of understanding of how far we've gone down the road and who's telling the
[48:33.680 --> 48:37.920]  truth who's lying about things in our country from the media and the
[48:37.920 --> 48:41.880]  government there's a broader understanding a deeper understanding from
[48:41.880 --> 48:47.360]  the people about who's on their side and who's not and that was a very very
[48:47.360 --> 48:52.320]  telling comment and comments that I heard back then this was coming from
[48:52.320 --> 48:57.720]  Democrats yeah let me add I mean because this is so important notice that was
[48:57.720 --> 49:02.040]  because Bush was the big bad devil they could see but Bush was just a puppet the
[49:02.040 --> 49:06.400]  globalist agenda the FEMA camps the martial law Democrats were worried then
[49:06.400 --> 49:11.600]  at the low level now that Obama's in there embracing it and the whole system
[49:11.600 --> 49:15.360]  you know let's say Bush built the rocket put it on the launch pad Obama just
[49:15.360 --> 49:20.200]  climbed in it and blasted off and now they're suddenly hailing the police state
[49:20.200 --> 49:24.680]  because they think they're in control of it yeah and I don't disagree with that I
[49:24.680 --> 49:29.360]  do agree but at the same time I'm seeing members of the Democratic and
[49:29.360 --> 49:34.320]  Republican parties how we got a long ways to go believe me I understand that
[49:34.320 --> 49:38.760]  but I'm seeing them start to understand that you know meet this new boss same as
[49:38.760 --> 49:43.000]  the old boss not much difference and so we got to figure out a way to start
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.440]  bringing people to a point elected and not elected to the point where they will
[49:47.440 --> 49:52.760]  stand in opposition to all of these types of proposals and policies no matter
[49:52.760 --> 49:57.960]  who it is as proposing them and where's battle lines being drawn and fought
[49:57.960 --> 50:02.440]  right here in Oklahoma and I hope in other states at the state level within
[50:02.440 --> 50:06.000]  the dip different caucuses of the different the two different parties so
[50:06.000 --> 50:11.160]  you're giving us the good news that you're saying that no really Republicans
[50:11.160 --> 50:14.800]  and Democrats now your colleagues they're starting to really understand
[50:14.800 --> 50:21.120]  that that this is an alien government yeah yeah they are and but again I
[50:21.120 --> 50:25.880]  recognize and admit we've still got a long ways to go because our enemies
[50:25.880 --> 50:30.600]  have learned how to use the systems and the processes against us so well and
[50:30.600 --> 50:34.960]  you've got so many people within the system elected and not elected within
[50:34.960 --> 50:38.560]  the political systems that they're there to look out for number one and they
[50:38.560 --> 50:41.840]  and they don't have the courage to stand up and fight it so they effectively
[50:41.840 --> 50:46.480]  they're like the willing doops stay there sir I want to come back and talk
[50:46.480 --> 50:50.960]  about how we help you expand the legislation you've already passed and
[50:50.960 --> 50:57.240]  and get that real ID fully killed stay with us ladies and gentlemen
[50:59.920 --> 51:04.080]  doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live
[51:04.080 --> 51:08.120]  in a pH balanced alkaline environment but as you know most people are overly
[51:08.120 --> 51:12.920]  acidic due to stress acidic diet and lack of exercise pH balance is the
[51:12.920 --> 51:16.440]  foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of
[51:16.440 --> 51:20.520]  disease people who alkalized the water they drink experience normalized blood
[51:20.520 --> 51:25.040]  sugar mental clarity and loss of weight it was intended for human beings to drink
[51:25.040 --> 51:29.440]  alkaline water but due to modern way of life most people are overly acidic the
[51:29.440 --> 51:33.320]  fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment fat
[51:33.320 --> 51:37.040]  accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't
[51:37.040 --> 51:42.200]  neutralize it do your part alkalize and supercharge your body now alcovision
[51:42.200 --> 51:46.440]  plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the
[51:46.440 --> 51:51.480]  pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops order your bottle

[52:02.400 --> 52:07.480]  American history a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy struck
[52:07.480 --> 52:13.360]  America on September 11th but who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to
[52:13.360 --> 52:17.120]  look to the Middle East we have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled enemies is the
[52:17.120 --> 52:20.960]  first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[52:20.960 --> 52:25.080]  networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there
[52:25.080 --> 52:30.880]  are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that
[52:30.880 --> 52:35.880]  some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the
[52:35.880 --> 52:39.720]  hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli
[52:39.720 --> 52:43.600]  intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government and much much
[52:43.600 --> 52:48.880]  more. Fabled enemies get the DVD at infowars.com for see it in super high

[54:01.240 --> 54:13.160]  Is it getting better?
[54:16.520 --> 54:22.920]  Or do you feel the same? Charles Key, Representative in Oklahoma,
[54:22.920 --> 54:25.880]  spearhead of a General Benton Parton and others exposing the bombs in the
[54:25.880 --> 54:31.320]  buildings. The police eyewitnesses and others, the federal forces brutally tortured
[54:31.320 --> 54:34.920]  to death and murdered. Like Cop of the Year, Terence Yankee,
[54:37.560 --> 54:44.600]  when they tried to expose it. So he's gone through that journey of putting his own
[54:44.600 --> 54:50.280]  personal fears aside and other things and that's what it comes down to all
[54:50.280 --> 54:53.800]  these politicians who want money and power and wearing their fancy suits and
[54:53.800 --> 54:57.080]  getting lobbyist money and going up the chain of command. We don't have any
[54:57.080 --> 55:00.600]  future. Your children and grandchildren don't have any future unless you face
[55:00.600 --> 55:04.760]  the facts and commit to expose this new world order, this global foreign banking
[55:04.760 --> 55:09.560]  takeover. It's a corporate takeover period and it's a hellish world they're
[55:09.560 --> 55:14.760]  building. And I'm telling everybody out there who serve the system, bureaucrats,
[55:14.760 --> 55:20.840]  police, private citizens, you better get involved in this fight right now because
[55:20.840 --> 55:24.040]  this is the fight of your life. This is the greatest threat this nation's ever
[55:24.040 --> 55:26.920]  faced. That's what our founders said over and over again.
[55:26.920 --> 55:30.040]  This nation cannot fall from without, it can only fall from within.
[55:30.040 --> 55:34.440]  Charles Key. Well, you ask what could people do and this is what I'd like to
[55:34.440 --> 55:39.000]  ask people to do, Alex. First of all, if you're from Oklahoma and if I could
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.760]  proceed this by telling a quick story on Real ID again, when we were fighting the
[55:42.760 --> 55:46.120]  Real ID battle last year, we had the Department of Public Safety battling
[55:46.120 --> 55:51.080]  against us, lobbying against us. We had Kevin Ward, the head of the
[55:51.080 --> 55:55.640]  department and his number two man there,
[55:55.640 --> 56:00.600]  Dusty Rusty Rhodes is his name, fighting against us. We're in one of the many
[56:00.600 --> 56:03.400]  meetings we had with them, Senator Brogan to myself. And in one of those
[56:03.400 --> 56:06.600]  meetings, Senator Brogan started off this
[56:06.600 --> 56:09.640]  meeting by saying, well, Representative Key and I, we think the biggest problem
[56:09.640 --> 56:13.960]  with the Real ID Act is the violation of the Constitution in our constitutional
[56:13.960 --> 56:17.000]  rights, et cetera, et cetera, but other people, you know, are concerned about the
[56:17.000 --> 56:21.000]  cost of it and ID theft and stuff like that.
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.640]  They actually said that then Kevin Ward, the head of DPS speaks up, he goes, well,
[56:25.640 --> 56:29.080]  we've got a difference of opinion on the Fourth Amendment. Brogan had made some
[56:29.080 --> 56:32.200]  comments about the Fourth Amendment. He says, we've got a difference of opinion
[56:32.200 --> 56:35.320]  in the Fourth Amendment, blah, blah, blah, made some comments about it.
[56:35.320 --> 56:38.600]  It was like sticking me with a hot poker or something and I just kind of popped
[56:38.600 --> 56:42.760]  up and I said, Commissioner Ward, I can't believe you just said that. The Fourth
[56:42.760 --> 56:46.600]  Amendment is real simple. It's very plain. What disagreement do we have? And then
[56:46.600 --> 56:51.320]  we get into this more energetic discussion, I would say, about the
[56:51.320 --> 56:55.400]  Constitution, which was similar to every meeting we had.
[56:55.400 --> 57:01.000]  That, I think, if it highlights anything, it highlights the problem we have
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.440]  with law enforcement. It's not that we are against law enforcement or we've got a
[57:04.440 --> 57:08.280]  problem with all of law enforcement, but some in law enforcement,
[57:08.280 --> 57:12.040]  they think they are the good guys and they should have the right to just make
[57:12.040 --> 57:16.120]  decisions. And that's a problem. So for people in Oklahoma,
[57:16.120 --> 57:21.320]  I would like them to call and email Kevin Ward at the Department of
[57:21.320 --> 57:25.480]  Public Safety and tell him to get off his
[57:25.480 --> 57:28.680]  program of trying to fight for the Federal Real
[57:28.680 --> 57:32.600]  ID Act in Oklahoma and let legislators do the legislating
[57:32.600 --> 57:35.960]  and him trying to make public policy in Oklahoma.
[57:35.960 --> 57:40.360]  I wish they would do that. And if people are afraid that somebody's going to
[57:40.360 --> 57:43.640]  come after them in Oklahoma law enforcement, please don't
[57:43.640 --> 57:46.760]  let that stop you from doing what is desperately needed.
[57:46.760 --> 57:51.160]  And if you have a problem like that, call my office. But please call Kevin Ward's
[57:51.160 --> 57:53.320]  office and your state representative and your state
[57:53.320 --> 57:57.320]  senator. Well, how they sell this is they've got to stop the illegal aliens.
[57:57.320 --> 58:01.880]  But in the amnesty bills he introduced, they're all given waivers and legalized.
[58:01.880 --> 58:05.960]  This Real ID Act is under international treaty, really a global ID, not just a
[58:05.960 --> 58:09.800]  national ID. And they're going to nexus
[58:09.800 --> 58:14.760]  nexus nexus nexus it in to everything,
[58:14.760 --> 58:19.880]  couldn't say that word, in their own documents. So it's about control and
[58:19.880 --> 58:24.120]  federalization. It has nothing to do with security.
[58:24.120 --> 58:29.560]  And it's federal IDs and and their databases that continue to cause most
[58:29.560 --> 58:33.080]  of the identity theft that's come out time and time again.
[58:33.080 --> 58:36.520]  Representative Charles Key, let's come back and talk more about the good news
[58:36.520 --> 58:41.320]  though that more and more states are moving for sovereignty.

[59:07.080 --> 59:10.680]  emergency if you simply prepare. No one is going to take care of your family in

[59:50.120 --> 1:00:00.120]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:12.920]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[1:00:12.920 --> 1:00:21.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:23.160 --> 1:00:29.000]  State Representative Charles Key is our guest. Oklahoma has passed legislation saying that
[1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:33.480]  they are a sovereign state not under federal or international control, that they're not
[1:00:33.480 --> 1:00:38.120]  going to allow gun confiscations or a quote new world or system to be brought into play.
[1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:43.720]  Upwards of 10 states have now introduced or are passing similar legislation. You know we always
[1:00:43.720 --> 1:00:48.440]  try to be nice and go we don't have a problem with law enforcement, peace officers, but we just
[1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:52.600]  want you to stop trying to make policy and cram things down our throats. Look state police,
[1:00:52.600 --> 1:00:57.480]  local police, they've been bought off by the feds. That's on record most of them. Some are good.
[1:00:59.080 --> 1:01:04.040]  But Representative Charles Key, you know the state police in Oklahoma, I've interviewed police
[1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:08.520]  officers and detectives that worked on Oklahoma City case, the bombing. They help cover it up with
[1:01:08.520 --> 1:01:15.720]  the feds. And so I think we need to get past the point and you know just come, I mean I have these
[1:01:15.720 --> 1:01:21.960]  articles every day. San Antonio Express News. Property seizures seen as piracy. And it says all
[1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:26.200]  over the state of Texas they pull over old ladies and take 4,000 out of their purse or they get
[1:01:26.200 --> 1:01:32.040]  checkpoints and take everybody's watches. And it's just all right here. Senator Juan
[1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:36.360]  Hinojosa believes some law enforcement agencies in the cash trap district of Rio Grande Valley
[1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:39.080]  have become so dependent on profitable seizures they routinely
[1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:44.520]  misapply the state's civil forfeiture law. They have other state reps here talking about enough
[1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:51.480]  is enough. This is highway robbery. I mean the police are out of control. Nine times out of 10
[1:01:51.480 --> 1:01:57.000]  worldwide police become the agents of oppression for the corrupt state and rob people. And that's
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:05.720]  just what America's turning into. I'm tired of having to you know qualify what we say about
[1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:12.760]  law enforcement or other you know entities like that. But when you're in a position in a political
[1:02:12.760 --> 1:02:17.000]  position like this you know that somebody's going to take comments I make for a program like this
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:23.240]  and come back and use it against me. So you know it's good to qualify that. But anyway let's get
[1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:27.400]  to the next subject and I said I had two things I'd like to suggest what people do. The second one
[1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:33.240]  is I wouldn't say forget the federal government or the federal legislators but put them on a
[1:02:33.240 --> 1:02:39.160]  back burner and put your efforts behind your state, house and senate members and especially
[1:02:39.160 --> 1:02:44.600]  in these states where they've got these 10th member type resolutions or other states and get
[1:02:44.600 --> 1:02:50.120]  behind them. You know we have some legislators in Texas that are interested in this but I can
[1:02:50.120 --> 1:02:55.640]  tell they're kind of fearful about bringing it up. So they need to hear from the people in Texas
[1:02:55.640 --> 1:03:00.840]  and the other states and there's legislators that want to address this problem. They want to do
[1:03:00.840 --> 1:03:05.560]  something about it but they unfortunately they need some people to get behind them and help them.
[1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:09.880]  And we need to put our efforts at the state level because the states are going to fix this.
[1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:15.880]  The feds are not going to. They've already caved. Well you talked about how you talked to your
[1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:20.280]  constituents and they're ready for revolution. The establishment knows that. That's why they're
[1:03:20.280 --> 1:03:25.800]  announcing 20,000 Homeland Security, battle-hardened army troops and to quote engage the American
[1:03:25.800 --> 1:03:34.760]  people. That's high treason right there. Well you know it's real hard to if it comes to that
[1:03:35.400 --> 1:03:43.240]  it's real hard to take on 300 million people. So if people will just stand up we can avert
[1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:48.200]  anything like that happening. We can fix it. We can do it without violence. We can do it peacefully
[1:03:48.200 --> 1:03:53.480]  but people need to stand up, be counted. All they have to do is speak up. All they have to do is speak
[1:03:53.480 --> 1:03:59.800]  up. It's that simple. Sir how do folks visit any of the key Oklahoma City sites or any of your
[1:03:59.800 --> 1:04:05.960]  legislative page? Well our Oklahoma legislative page you can just find it by googling Oklahoma
[1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:13.640]  House of Representatives and my office number is 405-557-7354. So it's easy to get a hold of me
[1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:18.760]  by email or telephone and anybody in Oklahoma if you're not already plugged into one of the many
[1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:23.960]  good groups in Oklahoma that's fighting for our Constitution and our country please do that. If
[1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:28.040]  you're not call me and I'll help you get plugged in. Well I just have to give you credit where
[1:04:28.040 --> 1:04:36.360]  credits do. You're a great hero and your help in passing the bill to declare sovereignty first
[1:04:36.360 --> 1:04:42.200]  has now led to nine other states moving to do it and this is history so I just want to say that

[1:06:20.200 --> 1:06:24.280]  Look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:06:24.280 --> 1:06:29.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:34.840]  in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:06:34.840 --> 1:06:40.120]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:06:40.120 --> 1:06:44.360]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,

[1:08:45.800 --> 1:08:52.520]  1-800-259-9231. Property seizure seen as piracy. I meant to get to this yesterday.
[1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:55.240]  I'm going to cover it right now. That I'm getting into the healthcare rationing.
[1:08:55.240 --> 1:08:59.000]  And that's in their own words before they would deny it. Now they just admit it.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:03.400]  Above 55, you just basically don't get healthcare. That's in the quote,
[1:09:03.400 --> 1:09:08.200]  spending and stimulus package. It's just a total globalist takeover admittedly modeled
[1:09:08.200 --> 1:09:13.480]  off the British system. They're now announcing we are all socialists now in Newsweek saying
[1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:18.200]  socialism will save us. This isn't even socialism. This is domestication. You know,
[1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:23.400]  are your pigs, if you own a hog farm and you go out and feed them, is it socialism? No.
[1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:26.520]  You own them. They're your slaves. You're going to butcher them. You're going to sell them.
[1:09:28.360 --> 1:09:34.840]  Property seizure seen as piracy. San Antonio Express News. Now I see this in little local
[1:09:34.840 --> 1:09:39.320]  papers all the time and then the police will pull over the riders and rough them up or take them
[1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:46.680]  to jail. That's come out in the news. More than nine towns last time I checked, according to the
[1:09:46.680 --> 1:09:50.680]  San Antonio Express News, fly the Mexican flag over the courthouse, over the city buildings.
[1:09:50.680 --> 1:09:55.480]  English is not allowed in court. It's really bad in South Texas, but it's not just that
[1:09:56.120 --> 1:10:03.160]  the Mexican practice of Mordito, beak dipping, kickbacks, shakedowns is coming here. It's all
[1:10:03.160 --> 1:10:09.480]  over. It's Boss Hog as well. And they, the state police as well, they just take your money.
[1:10:10.120 --> 1:10:16.280]  And then it's on record. It says a two decade old state law that grants authorities, really
[1:10:16.280 --> 1:10:20.360]  federal, the feds got it chartered and passed a two decade old state law that grants authorities.
[1:10:20.360 --> 1:10:24.760]  They're not public servants. They're authorities. The power to seize property using crimes
[1:10:26.200 --> 1:10:30.520]  is wielded by some agencies against people who never are charged with much less convicted
[1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:36.280]  of criminal activity. Law enforcement authorities in East Texas town of 1000 people, seize property
[1:10:36.280 --> 1:10:42.280]  from at least 140 motorists between 2000 and 60,000 and eight. And the date filed criminal charges
[1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:46.840]  against fewer than half, according to a review of court documents by the San Antonio Express News.
[1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:52.680]  Virtually anything of value was up for grabs, cash, cell phones, personal jewelry, a pair of
[1:10:52.680 --> 1:11:00.360]  sneakers and often the very car that was being driven through town. Some affidavits filed by
[1:11:00.360 --> 1:11:05.560]  officers relied on the presence of seemingly innocuous property as the only evidence that a
[1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:10.200]  crime had occurred. Yeah, they'll go, what are these speakers? These are stolen. You're like,
[1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:15.240]  no, I have a speaker system. Get out of the car. I'm taking it all. If you don't like it, buddy,
[1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:21.640]  I can take you in the woods and kill you. Oh, yeah. I've talked to people that's happened to
[1:11:21.640 --> 1:11:27.800]  Linda Dorman, a Akron, Ohio great grandmother had 4000 in cash taken from her by local authorities
[1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:32.600]  when she was stopped while driving through town after visiting Houston in April 2007.
[1:11:33.320 --> 1:11:39.480]  Yeah, I see famous cases. I see cases all the time where a neighbor will see somebody putting
[1:11:39.480 --> 1:11:43.000]  a rifle in the back of their truck to go deer hunting or the shooting range. The police are
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.880]  called. They go, well, we just started coming in your house without a warrant because the neighbor
[1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:50.280]  was scared by the gun. They said that you kind of pointed it in their direction when you walked
[1:11:50.280 --> 1:11:57.080]  out your car because you had it in your hand. And they come in and go, oh, oh, you got some
[1:11:57.080 --> 1:12:02.280]  gold coins there on the wall. And I'm going to take those and they just take it and laugh.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:07.080]  In fact, it was a case in Tucson of a gunshot been there for more than 30 years. We interviewed
[1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:12.520]  them. They had hidden cameras in case thieves broke in. It caught the VATF. The town had passed a
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:17.880]  new law that, you know, there's thousands of these cases, literally thousands. I can't even remember
[1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:25.080]  them all, even half of them. It was a few years ago and they, the town had passed a law that pawn
[1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:30.600]  shops had to pay a yearly fee couple hundred bucks. Well, he didn't even know his town where he lived
[1:12:30.600 --> 1:12:35.560]  outside town. The business had been annexed and he wasn't a pawn shop. But the law said that gun
[1:12:35.560 --> 1:12:41.400]  shops were pawn shops. So the VATF hit, they arrest him, taken to jail and then there's hours of them
[1:12:41.400 --> 1:12:47.640]  on the hard drive, on the camera, laughing and going, hey, listen, I get this one. This gun's
[1:12:47.640 --> 1:12:52.440]  worth four grand, you know, carved shotguns, you know, high quality British shotguns.
[1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:56.360]  And they were just there discussing how they were going to steal them.
[1:12:56.360 --> 1:13:06.200]  This is what America is, ladies and gentlemen. It goes on.
[1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:12.520]  Linda Dorman of Acro, Ohio, great grandmother had 4,000 in cash taken
[1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:17.320]  from by local authorities when she was stopped while driving a car through town after visiting
[1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:21.800]  Houston in April 2007. I've seen them robbing grandma's story over and over again because
[1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:26.600]  that always seems to get in the news. Old ladies carry a lot of cash around with them. It's over.
[1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:33.640]  And they know who to pick out, too. Well, take this cash. You're not against the officers, are you?
[1:13:33.640 --> 1:13:37.320]  Court records make no mention that anything illegal was found in her van. She's still
[1:13:37.320 --> 1:13:42.600]  hoping for the return of what she calls her life savings. You're al-Qaeda lady. You're not getting
[1:13:42.600 --> 1:13:48.920]  it, according to them. Dorman's attorney, David Gullery, calls the roadside stops and seizures
[1:13:48.920 --> 1:13:58.600]  in Tinahana, T-E-N-A-H-N, T-E-N-A-H-A, Highway Piracy, undertaken by police
[1:13:59.800 --> 1:14:03.960]  by a couple of law enforcement officers' agendas, get to keep most of what was seized.
[1:14:07.720 --> 1:14:17.480]  And it goes on. Gullery is suing officials in the town in Shelby County on behalf of Dorman
[1:14:17.480 --> 1:14:23.880]  and nine other clients as properly confiscated. All were African Americans driving
[1:14:24.680 --> 1:14:30.520]  either rentals or vehicles without of state plates. And this is how it works. It's all tribalism.
[1:14:31.080 --> 1:14:39.560]  The Mexicans mainly rob gringos in the Mexico-run towns in South Texas. I mean, it's openly. This
[1:14:39.560 --> 1:14:46.440]  is Mexico. And then the whites mainly rob blacks. And there aren't many towns run by blacks, but we
[1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:51.720]  have seen cases of the towns run by blacks robbing whites and Mexicans and others. This is just how
[1:14:51.720 --> 1:14:54.920]  it works, but they rob everybody else, too. I mean, you know, it's...
[1:14:58.600 --> 1:15:02.840]  Nullaroy alleges in the lawsuit that while his clients were detained, they were
[1:15:04.760 --> 1:15:08.920]  presented with an ultimatum. Wavier writes to your property exchange for a promise
[1:15:08.920 --> 1:15:13.400]  to be released and to not be criminally charged. He said most did, as Dorman did,
[1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:19.960]  signing the waiver to avoid jail. The state's asset seizure law requires that law enforcement
[1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:25.240]  agencies file criminal charges and civil forward your cases. It requires some reason I'm not
[1:15:25.240 --> 1:15:32.840]  reading too well today. It doesn't require. The state's asset seizure law doesn't require that
[1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:37.800]  law enforcement agencies file criminal charges and civil forward your cases. It requires only a
[1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:42.280]  preponderance of evidence that the property was used in the commission of certain crimes,
[1:15:42.280 --> 1:15:47.960]  such as drug crimes, or brought with the proceeds of those crimes. Yeah, so the cops feel good
[1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:52.200]  about themselves. They always go, but they keep the money themselves. Where'd you get all this
[1:15:52.200 --> 1:16:00.840]  money? This is a nice car. How do you afford this? No judge, no jury, no nothing. There's a lesser
[1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:05.000]  burden that is required in a criminal case and it allows police departments and prosecutors to
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:13.960]  divvy up what they get from such seizures. What critics say is a built-in incentive for unscrupulous.
[1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:20.200]  And it goes on under finance law enforcement agencies to illegally strip motorists of their
[1:16:20.200 --> 1:16:27.400]  property. Oh, they're under financed. So they have to engage in highway robbery because they're
[1:16:27.400 --> 1:16:37.320]  under financed. See how this article even acts like it's okay. Some lawmakers fed up with calls
[1:16:37.320 --> 1:16:44.040]  for my rate constituents say enough is enough. Senator John Whitmore, Democrat Houston chairman
[1:16:44.040 --> 1:16:48.840]  of the Senate criminal justice committee said the state's asset forward your law is being abused by
[1:16:48.840 --> 1:16:53.400]  enough jurisdictions across the state that he wants to rewrite major sections of it next year.
[1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:58.520]  The idea that people lose their property but are never charged and never get it back, that's theft
[1:16:58.520 --> 1:17:07.080]  as far as I'm concerned, he said. And it goes on and on from there. That means law enforcement
[1:17:07.080 --> 1:17:11.160]  agencies in the valley tend to target vehicles heading south of the border rather than neighbor
[1:17:12.200 --> 1:17:16.200]  northbound cars. Hennah Hoses said because the southbound vehicles are more likely to be
[1:17:16.200 --> 1:17:21.720]  transporting cash, the profits from the drug trade as opposed to just the drugs. Folks,
[1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:26.680]  they're only hiring more and more police, more and more cops, more and more agencies.
[1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:30.200]  They're always expanding. There was less than a million cops 10 years ago. There's now close
[1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:36.280]  to 3 million. Obama wants to expand that. And the police know the government ships in the drugs
[1:17:36.280 --> 1:17:40.760]  and then low level dealers, they love to shake them down and rob them. But then once you've robbed
[1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:46.520]  a bunch of drug dealers, why not go ahead and just rob citizens? Because it's all about the cash.
[1:17:46.520 --> 1:17:52.280]  They would hate it if this ended. $400 billion in narcotics profits a year.
[1:17:54.440 --> 1:18:02.360]  And you can Google these cases, more than 10,000 cases in the last 10 years in Dallas,
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:07.160]  of the police just pulling a nice car over, dropping a bag of chalk in the back,
[1:18:08.680 --> 1:18:13.480]  stealing the car, stealing their belongings, stealing their Rolex watches, taking everything
[1:18:13.480 --> 1:18:17.400]  they've got. And it came out and it was admitted and the police just said, well, what's wrong with that?
[1:18:18.760 --> 1:18:23.880]  Houston, 4,000 plus people framed, police chief didn't even get in trouble,
[1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:29.320]  where they just, anybody that they put in a quote, crime lab request for for a court case,
[1:18:29.320 --> 1:18:37.320]  they just falsified it. That's why when you read articles like the one that was in the
[1:18:37.320 --> 1:18:42.600]  statesman today about how basically everybody that's arrested anybody with a class B misdemeanor,
[1:18:42.600 --> 1:18:48.360]  anybody else not convicted will have your blood taken. This is the same police chief that we've
[1:18:48.360 --> 1:18:55.880]  had in studio. It's under federal tutelage. They're doing it all over the country where
[1:18:57.400 --> 1:19:00.520]  they don't even have real warrants. They just have these rubber stamp warrants and they want
[1:19:00.520 --> 1:19:07.640]  police to take your blood to quote, stop DWIs. Police chiefs want expanded DNA database.
[1:19:07.640 --> 1:19:13.160]  See now it's blood samples will be taken from anyone suspected of a class B misdemeanor or above.
[1:19:14.680 --> 1:19:18.600]  For the first time, hundreds of thousands of Texans arrested on suspicion of crimes would
[1:19:18.600 --> 1:19:23.560]  be forced to give samples of their DNA law enforcement officers under a change in state
[1:19:23.560 --> 1:19:29.960]  law being pushed by Texas top six police chiefs, including Austin's police chief, Art Acevedo.
[1:19:29.960 --> 1:19:35.480]  Now this started in England about 15 years ago. They said, oh, well, if you're arrested,
[1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:39.560]  well, now it's just if you're stopped, they take your blood and that'll be next. But
[1:19:39.560 --> 1:19:47.160]  the big dirty secret here is anybody 36 years old or younger has had your blood taken
[1:19:48.440 --> 1:19:53.320]  at birth and put in an illegal database. People denied that for years. Now it's declassified
[1:19:53.320 --> 1:19:57.960]  admitted. This is the shadow government and they want to frame you with this blood. They claim it's
[1:19:57.960 --> 1:20:04.840]  for your safety. Alex Jones here with a question. What does humidity mean to you? Most people think

[1:24:15.800 --> 1:24:20.760]  state news in this headline. We are all socialists now. That means you're under the control of the
[1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:28.520]  banksters. It means you got to be a slave go out around with your handout. That's why they're
[1:24:28.520 --> 1:24:37.320]  destroying the economy to train you to be a slave. Let's go ahead and talk to JT in Colorado. JT,
[1:24:37.320 --> 1:24:47.480]  welcome. Hi to talk to you. I have some clarification for you on the 10th amendment sovereignty
[1:24:47.480 --> 1:24:56.840]  resolution that the representative key was talking about. Oklahoma isn't the first, Alex.
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:06.600]  This movement has been alive now for 14 years. No, Oklahoma was the first and he was involved in it
[1:25:06.600 --> 1:25:13.480]  in 1994. Well, I'm not talking about the one. I'm not talking about the one they just passed
[1:25:13.480 --> 1:25:24.760]  last year. Go ahead. Well, no, the whole thing started in Colorado in 1994. I've been working
[1:25:24.760 --> 1:25:34.040]  hard keeping this thing alive because I was the representative legislative aide that put this
[1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:40.760]  thing together back in 1994. And Oklahoma has only passed this one now in one house.
[1:25:40.760 --> 1:25:48.760]  They did it originally in 1995 in one house, but they never could get it out because the
[1:25:48.760 --> 1:25:55.640]  Oklahoma City bombing was designed specifically to stop patriot groups from using state legislatures.
[1:25:55.640 --> 1:26:01.480]  No, I know, and Northcom is built all around this. I knew Colorado had been involved as well.
[1:26:01.480 --> 1:26:07.800]  The fellow censor, since you were the legislative aide who helped push all this. Well, it was
[1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:16.760]  passed by both houses of the Colorado State Legislature and signed on April 21st of 1994.
[1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:24.440]  And if anyone wants to see the legislative history, they can go over to the Prism Planet Forum.
[1:26:24.440 --> 1:26:30.360]  Every forum that I've been on since I was drummed out of the state house back in 1996,
[1:26:31.480 --> 1:26:37.080]  I have put this thing up as a sticky. I've tried to get to be moderators. I'm a moderator on your
[1:26:37.080 --> 1:26:44.600]  forum, and this thing is real. And once these things are passed, they are not rescinded.
[1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:51.720]  They have no sunset. Once a state has passed through both houses of its legislature,
[1:26:52.440 --> 1:26:59.320]  the 10th Amendment sovereignty resolution, they have affirmed that the 10th Amendment will be the
[1:26:59.320 --> 1:27:09.880]  law that relegates federal government mandates, any laws. So like what New Hampshire's doing
[1:27:10.600 --> 1:27:18.440]  with the, they're being very specific, you know, no martial law, no gun confiscation.
[1:27:18.440 --> 1:27:25.080]  What Charles Key was talking about earlier, and I talked to Charlie, good Lord, 14 years ago,
[1:27:25.080 --> 1:27:31.000]  and what they're doing with the Real ID Act, the federal government has to show
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:39.800]  that absolute chapter and verse constitutionality for any federal mandate under the 10th Amendment
[1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:46.920]  resolution. And these states like Colorado, who they have a new bunch of people in the
[1:27:46.920 --> 1:27:55.640]  state house now who have no idea what laws are on the books. And HJR 94, 1035 is on the books.
[1:27:55.640 --> 1:28:00.680]  California is the same way. They passed it in May of 1994.
[1:28:01.240 --> 1:28:05.240]  And that's the reason, wow, great job sir. Well, we need to have you on as a guest,
[1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:10.200]  send your info to joeyv at infowars.com, and I'll set up with your credentials,
[1:28:10.200 --> 1:28:13.960]  your background and the link to it, and we'll have you on as a proper guest. But let me just
[1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:19.640]  add something here. We've got some bad news for folks. The Senate has passed the stimulus,
[1:28:20.760 --> 1:28:26.200]  and it currently had the federalization of healthcare and the rationing for those over
[1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:32.200]  the age of 55 from healthcare. This is just horrible news. This is the Associated Press
[1:28:32.200 --> 1:28:39.800]  Senate passed a stimulus treasury unveils bank help. So they are moving ahead with more looting.
[1:28:39.800 --> 1:28:44.840]  But people always want solutions from us. They say there's no solutions. All we give
[1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:50.280]  is solutions here. And it is the state legislatures. That's a large part of it.
[1:28:50.840 --> 1:28:55.640]  And it's the counties and cities, the people taking these back. And absolutely, we need to
[1:28:55.640 --> 1:28:59.640]  enumerate what the feds are doing, how they're illegitimate, and circle the wagons at the state
[1:28:59.640 --> 1:29:05.080]  level. Because if you look at the attack profile of the feds, which are really the globalist,
[1:29:05.080 --> 1:29:10.040]  they are worried about the states. That's what Northcom, John Warner Defense Authorization Act,
[1:29:10.040 --> 1:29:17.080]  PDD 51 are all about. So their entire attack system is based around defending against that,
[1:29:17.080 --> 1:29:21.320]  showing us that's one of the big solutions. And so listeners, a lot of you say there's no
[1:29:21.320 --> 1:29:25.080]  solutions because you don't want to hear solutions because you want to sit on your butts
[1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:30.120]  and say you didn't hear solutions. This has been a solution. What's the title on prison

[1:29:36.600 --> 1:29:44.360]  found on the radio show page. And just have people type into the search block, we will defeat the

[1:35:06.280 --> 1:35:11.480]  top the 8.5 trillion they've stolen and they're not talking on where it went won't even tell congress

[1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:09.960]  yeah good day mr dunes hey i just had a quick question i was listening to your show yesterday
[1:36:09.960 --> 1:36:17.480]  with your guest from oklahoma the governor you're talking about uh state sovereignty
[1:36:18.520 --> 1:36:24.360]  and then you had a caller calling he was asking about the ucc redemption process and i was kind
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:30.440]  of wondering if you believe that there was any type of individual sovereignty that we could achieve
[1:36:31.400 --> 1:36:35.640]  yes you have the individual sovereignty because if somebody tries to make you their slave
[1:36:35.640 --> 1:36:43.000]  uh you can stick a knife in them or you can shoot them yeah but that's it listen the only
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:48.920]  what did tony montana say in scarface there's only one thing in this world that gives orders
[1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:55.160]  there's only one thing that uh lets you be free there's only one thing and what is that
[1:36:56.040 --> 1:37:01.240]  it is the will to stand up and fight this is this government doesn't follow its own laws
[1:37:01.240 --> 1:37:06.680]  it doesn't follow it's completely criminal it doesn't care if you file ucc stuff it doesn't
[1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:12.200]  care what you do it does what it wants it's called tyranny and i've seen all this patriot
[1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:18.040]  mythology since so many people to prison and most of its bull now can you within these corrupt
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:24.440]  courts use the constitution bill of rights use procedure use their violation of law and precedent
[1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:31.720]  to prosecute them yes yes either but the problem is is that so much of what we hear in patriot
[1:37:31.720 --> 1:37:39.320]  mythology isn't real the good news is let's say they expand zoning and say they're giving you
[1:37:39.320 --> 1:37:47.320]  $2,000 a day fines for three inch grass uh then what you do is you go and they always misapply
[1:37:47.320 --> 1:37:51.800]  even their own regulations plus the regulations unconstitutional and you could fight that and
[1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:58.040]  defeat it uh but uh does filing something and claiming your sovereignty to the queen of england
[1:37:58.040 --> 1:38:05.480]  they don't care they don't care it's all about political will freedom is not given it is taken
[1:38:05.480 --> 1:38:13.000]  it is cc they're seizing our liberty they are they are freebooting all over us they are piratically
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:19.880]  jumping onto us and dominating us we have to start howling right back and get in the fight

[1:38:44.280 --> 1:38:51.800]  government yep it sure is i was just thinking along the lines of nonviolent means and trying to

[1:39:15.160 --> 1:39:20.280]  if i'm charged with a ticket and i don't feel it's fair i just want to be able to handle it
[1:39:20.280 --> 1:39:25.160]  you know to let it go you need to fight the whole system and go in and demand and then go through
[1:39:25.160 --> 1:39:29.880]  the radar guns meters and go through the officer's oath and go through it all but but more than that
[1:39:29.880 --> 1:39:34.680]  i appreciate your call i do not consider i'm not saying do this i'm saying this is what the founding
[1:39:34.680 --> 1:39:42.760]  fathers did they beat up public officials i'm just telling you what they did in the in the decade
[1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:50.760]  leading up to 1775 when the when the british came to confiscate the guns they handed out flyers
[1:39:50.760 --> 1:39:58.680]  exposing corruption they would shun bureaucrats of a bureaucrat was sitting in a in a tavern eating
[1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:03.480]  a steak they'd walk up and say you're a piece of filth and a piece of garbage and they'd harry
[1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:09.640]  america and they'd call them out in church and they'd scream at them and they got aggressive
[1:40:09.640 --> 1:40:14.600]  and they had liberty polls they put up on city property and if they took them down they put
[1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:20.280]  them back up and the feds took them down they burned down the fed sign and they would gather
[1:40:20.280 --> 1:40:25.000]  and they got aggressive and the feds would grab a patriot and beat them to death and well then
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:29.320]  suddenly bureaucrats would get beaten to death and that's how this country was founded and anybody
[1:40:29.320 --> 1:40:34.440]  that doesn't like it doesn't know what this nation's all about now i don't want to go that route
[1:40:34.440 --> 1:40:40.360]  because the establishment could care less about its enforcers and they they want to get a hot war
[1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:44.760]  going on because that will further destroy the economy in the country and the global is considered
[1:40:44.760 --> 1:40:51.720]  offshore and laugh i want to expose the tyranny and the treason that's going on and have the people
[1:40:52.440 --> 1:40:56.760]  stand up and say no to it so that there's such a human cry that people see what's happening
[1:40:56.760 --> 1:41:01.240]  we have to discredit the system it's bad it's evil it's not broken though it's working just
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:06.440]  like it's meant to to steal and rob and control and domesticate what does a serial killer do they

[1:42:53.960 --> 1:42:59.560]  right but well they can detect them at their own bases before they carry out stage terror attacks
[1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:05.320]  right it it says it's built up the ground up i was taking notes on it built up the ground up
[1:43:05.320 --> 1:43:09.960]  like a military vehicle and we don't want these vehicles getting into the public public hands they
[1:43:09.960 --> 1:43:14.120]  said and it can read well yeah because we're the enemy the i mean they can't have the enemy
[1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:18.200]  having their weapons they're here to ship in narcotics and rule over us and put on our kids in
[1:43:18.200 --> 1:43:22.600]  prison well can we stop them from like releasing this and just say i don't want the military on

[1:43:55.800 --> 1:44:00.600]  um i just want to say just for people one thing i'm trying to do on my town is just plant random
[1:44:00.600 --> 1:44:06.600]  fruit trees and open spaces try to establish community gardens seems to my estimation one of the
[1:44:07.320 --> 1:44:13.400]  the two main things we have to secure is food supplies and liquid fuels uh after that everything
[1:44:13.400 --> 1:44:17.480]  else should you know it'll be hard enough but i mean without food without fuel yeah that's it
[1:44:17.480 --> 1:44:22.440]  this is feudalism i mean what did they put iraq under but 14 years of siege before they went
[1:44:22.440 --> 1:44:26.920]  in and blew the daylights out of them now for six more years three million total dead million
[1:44:26.920 --> 1:44:35.720]  300 000 dead since the liberation uh five years and 11 months ago so all of this is going on
[1:44:35.720 --> 1:44:40.360]  that's what they want here it's in the ran corporation documents covered in in game
[1:44:40.360 --> 1:44:45.720]  it's in the club of rome documents they want feudalism they they they take over the farms
[1:44:45.720 --> 1:44:51.240]  with big agribusiness they pay companies to go offshore the bailout for the auto industries
[1:44:51.240 --> 1:44:56.200]  is so they can move to brazil and china that's in the mainstream is it's all about getting
[1:44:56.200 --> 1:45:00.760]  us into a fiat economy getting us all in debt and then pulling the rug out from under us
[1:45:01.800 --> 1:45:05.960]  like an authorization from the town council to do this in public spaces as well and we
[1:45:05.960 --> 1:45:10.600]  have plenty like little scrub areas away from everything but in the main centers in the main
[1:45:10.600 --> 1:45:15.000]  areas and planners you know just just food i live when you go to south america central america and
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:20.280]  you can just you know randomly run into a tree with some food on it and now that's what germany
[1:45:20.280 --> 1:45:25.240]  that's what germany's always done and i and i totally agree with you anything else uh yeah i'd
[1:45:25.240 --> 1:45:30.360]  also like to just um and try to encourage everybody to be jesus like you know jesus stayed strong in

[1:46:11.720 --> 1:46:18.440]  the difference between a bank bailout and a prime d scheme well the prime d scheme you're gonna make a
[1:46:18.440 --> 1:46:24.360]  return on your investment but a bank bailout the government takes your money gives it to the bank
[1:46:24.360 --> 1:46:30.520]  to lend it back to you at interest and they just keep cycling it every 20 years that's it good
[1:46:30.520 --> 1:46:35.880]  point anything else now that's it for now hey good to hear from you thanks for calling from the uk

[1:47:30.920 --> 1:47:37.240]  you your friends your family your neighbor familiarity breeds contempt so what you do
[1:47:37.240 --> 1:47:41.480]  is you try to sell people who don't know you they actually have more respect for you but if
[1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:47.560]  you're going to sell somebody on the truth you do it with films loose change final cut in game

[2:11:14.280 --> 2:11:18.040]  thank you for joining us can you comment on just the overall picture and then let's get into what's
[2:11:18.040 --> 2:11:23.320]  happening with the second amendment well if we might be thinking that uh they're going to move
[2:11:23.320 --> 2:11:31.320]  first on legislation and they might i'm not quite as sure that uh as i was earlier that uh they
[2:11:31.320 --> 2:11:38.760]  wouldn't want to put their own folks on record voting for gun control because obama had within
[2:11:38.760 --> 2:11:45.800]  hours of his inauguration on the white house website whitehouse.gov a call for the renewal of
[2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:51.480]  the clinton gun ban that's something that i'm still not sure whether he intended just as some
[2:11:51.480 --> 2:11:57.800]  raw meat for his base or whether he actually expects to move in the congress putting guys
[2:11:57.800 --> 2:12:04.600]  his feet to the fire recorded votes before the next congressional elections which theoretically
[2:12:04.600 --> 2:12:11.480]  quite possibly could uh jeopardize his party's control of the congress on the other hand since
[2:12:11.480 --> 2:12:22.040]  he's become president i've become more aware of just how much uh of a willingness uh he has to
[2:12:22.040 --> 2:12:30.360]  exhibit his um his thuggishness uh that he is a guy who's rather ignorant of a number of things
[2:12:31.080 --> 2:12:36.600]  but as is the case with many arrogant people ignorant seems to be quite happily
[2:12:38.200 --> 2:12:47.240]  coexisting with the arrogance so i am not sure as i as i was that he's not going to move legislatively
[2:12:47.240 --> 2:12:54.840]  but that being said administratively he's got a wide open field he's got an attorney general
[2:12:54.840 --> 2:13:04.280]  who's a gun grabber par excellence eric holder uh the right now uh as i'm sure you've commented
[2:13:04.280 --> 2:13:12.120]  on more than once there's a huge spike in guns and ammo sales well of course ammo sales don't
[2:13:12.120 --> 2:13:19.880]  require any federal paperwork at this time but what if um a dealer manages to get in a bunch of
[2:13:20.520 --> 2:13:27.000]  guns that have been backordered for a long time which is the back ordering is what's going on
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:34.040]  for a number of popular calibers and uh he can't sell you the gun anyway well why not you ask i
[2:13:34.040 --> 2:13:40.840]  got my money you got the gun what's the problem well i need copies of the 44 73 that the government
[2:13:40.840 --> 2:13:48.120]  makes me have you fill out so they can register your name and um i'm running out of copies well
[2:13:48.120 --> 2:13:53.480]  you say well man that's no problem go make some copies on your copy machine i see it right over
[2:13:53.480 --> 2:14:00.760]  there um no i'm not allowed to do that i have to only get them from the bat fe the bureau
[2:14:00.760 --> 2:14:06.520]  battle the back of arms and explosives themselves this is a cute little game that's being played
[2:14:06.520 --> 2:14:13.080]  and dealers from around the country are reporting that they are running out of forms and that somehow
[2:14:13.080 --> 2:14:19.400]  the bureau just can't seem to manage to get the forms out there in the field and of course you're
[2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:25.240]  not allowed to make your own unbelievable this is first time i've heard of this is this breaking
[2:14:25.240 --> 2:14:31.560]  news your it's been going on for it's been building you know at first there were a few dealers complaining
[2:14:31.560 --> 2:14:36.840]  about it and now it's becoming a more general complaint uh dealers of even i know in the state
[2:14:36.840 --> 2:14:42.920]  of maryland had some meetings about it but i've had reports from out in the west everywhere
[2:14:42.920 --> 2:14:48.520]  so this is something that's percolating down there among the gun stores and i guess it's
[2:14:48.520 --> 2:14:56.200]  it's just such a stupid bureaucratic um problem that people can't quite believe well we know it's
[2:14:56.200 --> 2:15:03.800]  on purpose uh i had i had erin zelman on a few days ago and he said flat out he said he thinks
[2:15:03.800 --> 2:15:10.440]  obama's gonna stage a mass shooting or they're gonna line some lunatic up to do it um the economy's
[2:15:10.440 --> 2:15:15.480]  falling apart all these top government people are saying they believe it's gonna be riots everywhere
[2:15:15.480 --> 2:15:21.640]  the icelandic government fell if there are riots breaking out the answer is more guns and not less
[2:15:21.640 --> 2:15:27.560]  look at the koreans in the la riots stopping the rioting in their area when the police stood down
[2:15:27.560 --> 2:15:32.200]  so i just want to get it out there up front we don't want to see new warlands too but nationwide
[2:15:32.200 --> 2:15:36.760]  where they don't come and give you aid but the army comes and takes your guns can you speak to that
[2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:41.000]  and speak to the fact that they're announcing north com and the army war college are saying 20
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:46.520]  thousand combat troops to engage the american people and their new mission is uh engaging the people
[2:15:46.520 --> 2:15:52.840]  well if they take people's guns when the people are simply what doing what they were doing after
[2:15:52.840 --> 2:15:59.240]  katrina guarding their property they're going to have a little problem because the soldiers or
[2:15:59.240 --> 2:16:06.600]  the fbi agents or the marshals whoever might be will be individually liable if they are working
[2:16:06.600 --> 2:16:13.080]  under quote color of law of the federal government they're going to be personally liable for a lawsuit
[2:16:13.080 --> 2:16:18.520]  this is a measure that was enacted into law thanks to louisiana senator david vitter and
[2:16:18.520 --> 2:16:24.680]  then representative bobby jindal now the governor of louisiana and it says not only would the
[2:16:25.480 --> 2:16:31.560]  law enforcement official be personally liable for legal expenses his department couldn't pay what could
[2:16:31.560 --> 2:16:37.560]  easily be tens of thousands of dollars to defend him but if there were a monetary settlement because
[2:16:37.560 --> 2:16:43.960]  this would be a a civil complaints not a criminal charge but if there were a monetary settlement
[2:16:43.960 --> 2:16:49.640]  it'd be his house on the block it would be his retirement on the block it could come out but
[2:16:49.640 --> 2:16:55.400]  under pdd 51 the john warren defense authorization act and others it says if the president says all
[2:16:55.400 --> 2:17:00.520]  the laws are suspended congress can't even be involved now that's obviously unconstitutional
[2:17:01.320 --> 2:17:07.160]  but north com doesn't care i mean we are heading towards a constitutional crisis well it would take
[2:17:07.160 --> 2:17:12.280]  us right back to the kind of government we had under abraham lincoln who also had a similar
[2:17:12.280 --> 2:17:18.440]  disregard for the constitution he was arresting members of state legislatures tried to arrest
[2:17:18.440 --> 2:17:25.000]  members of the supreme court of the state of maryland exiled literally exiled a member of congress
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:33.800]  van landingham from ohio who didn't agree with him this was a guy who just rode roughshot over
[2:17:33.800 --> 2:17:39.720]  the constitution at the very time when the protections of the constitution are most needed
[2:17:39.720 --> 2:17:46.760]  during a crisis that's of course when tyrants say oh well we have to be given absolute powers
[2:17:47.960 --> 2:17:53.880]  you know i've taunted anti gunners in the past when they were for violating privacy when they
[2:17:53.880 --> 2:17:58.360]  wanted to make it easier to get convictions when they wanted to do a number of things like that
[2:17:58.360 --> 2:18:02.280]  i said well why don't you just get rid of all the bill of rights wouldn't that make government
[2:18:02.280 --> 2:18:08.120]  much more efficient and at least at that time two three years ago they kind of embarrassed them
[2:18:08.120 --> 2:18:14.280]  but uh from what you're saying with uh this kind of a presidential directive they're not they're
[2:18:14.280 --> 2:18:24.120]  past being embarrassed does it does it give you a ray of sunshine to know that upwards of 10 states
[2:18:24.120 --> 2:18:29.240]  are moving to declare sovereignty and in the bills they're saying things like we're not going along
[2:18:29.240 --> 2:18:34.360]  with your marshal law we're not going along with gun confiscation we're not going along with national
[2:18:34.360 --> 2:18:42.760]  compulsory service these are good first steps they need to be obviously made a lot more specific
[2:18:42.760 --> 2:18:50.280]  have teeth put in them they need to state as the pre war between the state's laws did
[2:18:50.280 --> 2:18:59.000]  uh making it a null law the fugitive slave law so that if somebody try a federal marshal tried to
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:05.720]  enforce fugitive slave law arrested a slave say in illinois the laws there said you're guilty of
[2:19:05.720 --> 2:19:12.280]  kidnap you just broke the law you can't enforce that law that laws null and void here now when we
[2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:20.040]  get legislatures and governors to that point then they will be tangibly moving to protect the liberties
[2:19:20.040 --> 2:19:27.000]  of the people the montana legislature had something somewhat of that in mind when they
[2:19:27.000 --> 2:19:34.600]  announced before the supreme court decision on the dc gunband that hey if if you flub this one
[2:19:34.600 --> 2:19:38.840]  we're out of here i can spell out they said it a little bit more yeah stay there let's come back
[2:19:38.840 --> 2:19:43.160]  and talk about that and talk about solutions so we can circle the wagons and and not just offend
[2:19:43.160 --> 2:19:48.200]  the second amendment but but take ground back that we've lost also i was just we're live at

[2:24:16.680 --> 2:24:21.320]  gun grabbers were coming that they were the only real gun organization that the NRA was actually
[2:24:21.320 --> 2:24:27.560]  founded and carries out gun control he read all their quotes the documents in a lot of people
[2:24:27.560 --> 2:24:31.800]  lot all bushes and everything's fine and now you're seeing what's happening join gun owners of
[2:24:31.800 --> 2:24:36.600]  america today Larry give folks the phone number and the website for people to join or at least get
[2:24:36.600 --> 2:24:42.440]  on the free email alerts list so that I mean we can defend the second amendment well the phone

[2:24:49.160 --> 2:24:57.160]  then the letters GUNS but the easiest way to get to us is the web gunowners.org and if you
[2:24:57.880 --> 2:25:03.400]  go there you can get a free subscription to our email alerts and those enable people to
[2:25:03.400 --> 2:25:08.680]  fire off email to their members of congress I don't know what we're going to be able to stop
[2:25:08.680 --> 2:25:15.640]  but I can tell you that we know from past that even when they continue to do bad things we see
[2:25:15.640 --> 2:25:22.040]  them backing off we see them slowing down we see them putting aside some of their agenda when they
[2:25:22.040 --> 2:25:27.320]  realize that they're building opposition so I would encourage people to take advantage of that
[2:25:28.040 --> 2:25:35.080]  gunowners.org and the email alert it's a freebie and that's one of the ways they could really
[2:25:35.080 --> 2:25:39.800]  be sure that they're going to be fighting to keep their guns yeah I mean I asked people a year ago
[2:25:39.800 --> 2:25:44.360]  on show after show at least go sign up for the free email alert the NRA is not going to give you
[2:25:44.360 --> 2:25:49.560]  these and I'm not attacking NRA members we're stating the historical fact it's a Judas Goat
[2:25:49.560 --> 2:25:53.800]  and Larry would never go on air and and and really try to bash and do that but he started
[2:25:53.800 --> 2:25:59.080]  doing it a year ago and because he went over the the history their quotes they helped pass the 68
[2:25:59.080 --> 2:26:05.480]  gun control act started all this instant check and registration we have today and the the second
[2:26:05.480 --> 2:26:12.600]  amendment is on a razor's edge right now and the they're not even seeing the forms out to most of
[2:26:12.600 --> 2:26:19.560]  gun dealers now the guns are selling out they're moving against the second amendment you need
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:23.880]  to be members they need financial support they're the only real lobbyists we've got on the hill
[2:26:24.520 --> 2:26:28.120]  Larry Pratt give them the number again and tell them how much the memberships cost
[2:26:28.120 --> 2:26:33.640]  it's all of 20 bucks and you can call and get information for membership at triple eight
[2:26:33.640 --> 2:26:42.040]  double eight six guns that's 888 886 and then the letters GUNS or they can simply go to gunowners.org
[2:26:42.040 --> 2:26:48.200]  in addition to that free subscription for the email alerts anybody can join up there also
[2:26:48.200 --> 2:26:55.000]  at that same website 20 bucks we'd be happy to have them sign up for time payments or full payment
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:27:01.640]  as a life member but we just would like to be able to pay the the rent as a friend of mine said
[2:27:01.640 --> 2:27:08.200]  you can't save the world if you can't pay the rent Larry folks weren't listening last year but I
[2:27:08.200 --> 2:27:11.800]  was talking during the break a lot of folks are joining now big or at least signing up with the
[2:27:11.800 --> 2:27:15.800]  free email alerts because they now understand we weren't playing games and we told them last year
[2:27:15.800 --> 2:27:21.880]  the BATF radically expanding its size its new building its harassment I mean they are coming
[2:27:21.880 --> 2:27:28.040]  for the gods give you another example of what's being done administratively we were successful
[2:27:28.040 --> 2:27:34.520]  in blocking Mike Sullivan a U.S. attorney from Boston and a personal friend of Ted Kennedy
[2:27:35.800 --> 2:27:40.360]  well I'm not sure for how much longer because Kennedy seems to be in poor health but in any case
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:46.040]  Sullivan was the acting director of the bureau of alcohol tobacco farms and explosives and during
[2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:54.120]  his hearing to be the full-time permanent director kind of an appointment as the same as the FBI
[2:27:54.120 --> 2:28:00.920]  head Ted Kennedy said that he looked forward to working with Sullivan on gun control well
[2:28:00.920 --> 2:28:09.400]  we were successful in blocking Mike Sullivan from getting a permanent job as the head of the BATFE
[2:28:09.400 --> 2:28:19.640]  but on his way out on the 14th of January six days before the inauguration of the Messiah
[2:28:21.480 --> 2:28:30.040]  the BATFE filed a notice of proposed rulemaking which gun owners of America will be addressing
[2:28:30.760 --> 2:28:37.560]  well before the expiration of time and in that it does something that they had been seeking
[2:28:37.560 --> 2:28:44.920]  legislatively because they arguably would have somewhat more justification by law although
[2:28:44.920 --> 2:28:51.320]  there is no law that can justify anything that the BATFE does because it's an unconstitutional
[2:28:51.320 --> 2:29:02.360]  entity but in any case this proposed rule would let some any unnamed uncounted bureaucrat in
[2:29:02.360 --> 2:29:09.880]  Boise in Fort Lauderdale whatever field office that the bureau might have
[2:29:10.920 --> 2:29:17.240]  yank a dealer's license and that that would be the final word well there goes your you know due

[2:29:24.840 --> 2:29:28.920]  more minutes was on the side I want to finish up with this and talk about solutions but that's
[2:29:28.920 --> 2:29:34.520]  what they're wanting to pass a bill where holder can just ban any guns he wants it gives him this
[2:29:34.520 --> 2:29:39.720]  imperial power so we see everything being converted to the agencies under the national

[2:33:47.240 --> 2:33:52.280]  you know people argue with me or the guy at a gun shop argue with me saying i was a liar i knew
[2:33:52.280 --> 2:33:57.720]  they were harassing gun shops and dealers i knew they were using uh extra judicial just executive
[2:33:57.720 --> 2:34:02.040]  bureaucratic authority to do this we're just talking about holder with a bill introduced to
[2:34:02.040 --> 2:34:07.240]  give him unlimited power to ban any guns he wants it says it in the bill national registration
[2:34:07.240 --> 2:34:13.000]  national federal testing psychological records misdemeanors can own a gun no fly lish can have
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:18.760]  a gun when they just put over a million americans innocently on those a blacklist all of this is
[2:34:18.760 --> 2:34:22.200]  happening and i keep trying to tell the listeners now i guess they're finally listening record gun
[2:34:22.200 --> 2:34:26.600]  sales but a lot of places they can't buy them so i've got emails about that but larry pratt
[2:34:26.600 --> 2:34:30.120]  wasn't telling me and i don't have time to track it down about how a lot of these gun shops can't
[2:34:30.120 --> 2:34:34.680]  even sell guns now because they won't send them the yellow forms uh i want to put the call out
[2:34:34.680 --> 2:34:41.160]  again to listeners because j pfo makes films writes books is more of a think tank studying the
[2:34:41.160 --> 2:34:46.040]  gun grabbers and i know you work with them just preservation farms ownership it's one of the
[2:34:46.040 --> 2:34:50.360]  only national organizations other than you but it's small you've got 250 something thousand
[2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:56.200]  members next to the n r a two or three million it's always changing and when we say the n r a
[2:34:56.200 --> 2:35:01.400]  and i want you briefly to go into this but then finish up your story from earlier first about
[2:35:01.400 --> 2:35:05.960]  just the bureaucracy you know saying we can shut down any gun show or gun shop we want
[2:35:05.960 --> 2:35:11.800]  without an arrest without an indictment without a claim just we anchor license kind of like americans
[2:35:11.800 --> 2:35:15.640]  can own guns on the new terror watch list and there's homeland security so you won't be able
[2:35:15.640 --> 2:35:20.040]  to buy or sell your credit cards are going to be turned off you're like how do i get off this list
[2:35:20.040 --> 2:35:23.880]  haven't paid taxes they're going to turn it off it's not just the no fly list folks it's a database
[2:35:24.440 --> 2:35:28.360]  there's a lot i'm throwing out here the point is one more time gun owners

[2:36:12.440 --> 2:36:17.800]  for most people i think who have a computer definitely easiest to go to gun owners dot org
[2:36:18.360 --> 2:36:24.280]  there they can get both the email alerts which is a freebie and then they can sign up as a member
[2:36:24.280 --> 2:36:29.720]  they'll get a newsletter they'll get legislative mailings on some of the more proactive projects
[2:36:29.720 --> 2:36:35.160]  that we're working on that are not as time sensitive as the ones that are dealt with by the email
[2:36:35.160 --> 2:36:40.840]  which are things that just come up all of a sudden and have a very short fuse on them and
[2:36:41.560 --> 2:36:46.280]  there'll be things that we just don't even we can't even mail on there's so many things going on
[2:36:46.280 --> 2:36:51.960]  like this i'm not sure whether we'll ever get to the mail on this notion that the dealers can be
[2:36:51.960 --> 2:37:01.880]  shut down now by some unnamed unspecified faceless bureaucrat thousands of them throughout the country
[2:37:02.600 --> 2:37:10.600]  pulling their licenses on really nothing type of complaints and we've talked about it before maybe
[2:37:10.600 --> 2:37:18.680]  that they let three or four customers do an abbreviation for baltimore blto instead of writing it
[2:37:18.680 --> 2:37:24.760]  out baltimore yeah they're coming in and they're white glove inspecting everything they're shutting
[2:37:24.760 --> 2:37:30.120]  down gun shops everywhere they've introduced bills to shut down the gun shows private transfer
[2:37:30.120 --> 2:37:37.000]  but but you're saying this was done as he left they just did it by fiat no law in congress
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:43.480]  no nothing this is going on now now the gun shops are even in more terror right it's a proposed rule
[2:37:43.480 --> 2:37:49.320]  that's something sometime in april is the deadline for filing comments we're not going to suggest
[2:37:49.320 --> 2:37:55.000]  that most of our members would enjoy writing directly to the bureau but we are going to
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:38:00.520]  make it so that they can do a little reigning of email and comment to their members of congress
[2:38:00.520 --> 2:38:05.320]  so their members of congress realize that they don't do something about this this can be one
[2:38:05.320 --> 2:38:14.360]  more reason not to vote for them in two years well absolutely um on the subject is briefly the nra
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  just give people a snapshot of the of what you've covered in the past that this really is a gun
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:28.280]  control group well the biggest disappointment was their complete blindness to the veterans disarmament
[2:38:28.280 --> 2:38:35.000]  act as we called it because it targeted veterans first you can lose your right to keep and bear
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  arms without even a smidgen of due process no trial no jury no no real judge no real court no lawyer
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:52.200]  no expert witnesses no cross examination no confronting your adversary your accuser just
[2:38:52.200 --> 2:38:59.160]  you go before some bureaucrat and uh he you don't even go before him actually in the case of
[2:38:59.160 --> 2:39:05.320]  the veterans if they get a diagnosis that says they have something like post-traumatic stress
[2:39:05.320 --> 2:39:11.320]  disorder that they might be a danger to sell for others boom they've just lost their gun rights
[2:39:11.320 --> 2:39:15.800]  again holder holder has said they're going to expand this to everybody and even get juvenile
[2:39:15.800 --> 2:39:22.440]  crime records and juvenile psychology records most of america uh has been sent to a psychologist
[2:39:22.440 --> 2:39:28.760]  at one time or the other because they advertise it's the thing to do it's over the um uh bill
[2:39:28.760 --> 2:39:35.240]  that we call the veterans disarmament act which i repeat was simply named that by us because they
[2:39:35.240 --> 2:39:40.680]  were the first in the crosshairs but as you're saying all they need to do is appropriate the money
[2:39:40.680 --> 2:39:46.600]  that was authorized in that bill and they're going to come after everybody else's medical records
[2:39:46.600 --> 2:39:51.560]  it doesn't matter whether they were a veteran or not all they have to do is have some indication that
[2:39:51.560 --> 2:39:59.400]  as you say you a been to a psychiatrist and he has found in in some way that a diagnosis that
[2:39:59.400 --> 2:40:05.080]  might make you a danger to sell for others will that might could be perhaps one and they do that
[2:40:05.080 --> 2:40:08.760]  they do that for everybody because they tell people go to it they go to get you on insurance
[2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:12.920]  i'm going to give you this diagnosis there's literally close to a thousand different ones
[2:40:12.920 --> 2:40:16.760]  even criticizing the government seen as a mental illness now they have over a hundred
[2:40:16.760 --> 2:40:21.640]  designations there and this is your opinion in the bill that the current white house chief of
[2:40:21.640 --> 2:40:27.000]  staff introduced last year when he was in the house representatives from illinois and he supported
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:32.120]  the total chicago gun ban the dc gun ban uh holder argued before the supreme court for a total gun
[2:40:32.120 --> 2:40:37.400]  ban i mean this is what they do they they've introduced that bill again and i know you know
[2:40:37.400 --> 2:40:43.240]  this is for the audience that says you'll be federally tested and federally licensed and all
[2:40:43.240 --> 2:40:49.080]  your psychological records must be provided by you in indentured servitude you go before a federal
[2:40:49.080 --> 2:40:55.160]  board that's how they basically ban guns in new york 30 40 years ago saying oh you can get a gun
[2:40:55.160 --> 2:40:59.400]  once you go to our board once you get a psychological test and then they just don't have the board
[2:40:59.400 --> 2:41:04.040]  meet once every six months that you can't get on the list so through bureaucracy you never get the
[2:41:04.040 --> 2:41:11.160]  the gun and even if they give you an opinion what do you do you don't have a court trial there you
[2:41:11.160 --> 2:41:18.040]  don't have any due process there you're flat out of luck it's just some folks that have some process
[2:41:18.040 --> 2:41:23.000]  that you may not even be aware of and they render an opinion that says we don't find you fit to own
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:28.920]  a gun now they do that by fiat when you when you can't get a gun then you call then you got a file
[2:41:28.920 --> 2:41:34.200]  paperwork pay for a lawyer yourself and then maybe get a hearing with a kangaroo court it'll be a
[2:41:34.200 --> 2:41:40.680]  kangaroo court because it'll be a hearing that considers a record that's already been produced
[2:41:40.680 --> 2:41:46.440]  by this body that screwed you to begin with it's not as if you go into a court where you're supposed
[2:41:46.440 --> 2:41:52.040]  to have a clean slate the government is accusing you the burden of proof is on them and then you
[2:41:52.040 --> 2:41:59.480]  start from there to build a record in a normal trial proceeding the trial that they'll be talking
[2:41:59.480 --> 2:42:05.160]  about is more like an appeal where the only thing that can be considered is the record brought in
[2:42:05.160 --> 2:42:11.720]  from the lower quote court well since they've already got about an instance when the BATFE does
[2:42:11.720 --> 2:42:19.080]  this right now to dealers with their administrative law procedures there's a 95 percent zapping of
[2:42:19.080 --> 2:42:24.840]  the dealer so if a poor dealer wants to appeal to a federal court even though the law says the court
[2:42:24.840 --> 2:42:30.120]  supposed to give him that brand new trial they don't they accept the record of the bureaucrat
[2:42:30.120 --> 2:42:35.320]  so so what's happening yeah yeah so they're putting our entire second amendment into a
[2:42:35.320 --> 2:42:40.920]  bureaucratic system expanding the narrow bureaucratic powers they got into the 68 gun control act to
[2:42:40.920 --> 2:42:47.320]  fully savage the second amendment outside any judicial system outside is the key because that
[2:42:47.320 --> 2:42:53.720]  was supposed to be short of the bullet box the jury box was supposed to be our ultimate defense
[2:42:53.720 --> 2:43:00.920]  of our free society of our free state to use the term of the second amendment and if the jury
[2:43:00.920 --> 2:43:07.160]  isn't even involved they're so afraid of us that even though they often feed us like mushrooms and
[2:43:07.160 --> 2:43:12.520]  get juries to do things that if the jurors really knew what was going on they wouldn't rule the way
[2:43:12.520 --> 2:43:18.040]  they do but they don't even want to take that chance and so they just bypass the jury all together
[2:43:18.040 --> 2:43:23.000]  because when you go into that federal court the jury's never going to if there is a jury they're
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:30.360]  never going to hear any of your real case because that's already been quote presented at the lower
[2:43:30.360 --> 2:43:37.880]  court and they got it all structured and jiggered against you it's kangaroo court is a very app
[2:43:37.880 --> 2:43:45.240]  description well the good news is i've seen the numbers from the fbi 45 percent of 44 percent
[2:43:45.800 --> 2:43:52.120]  the previous highest record now four months running with guns being purchased and ammo
[2:43:52.120 --> 2:43:56.600]  being purchased and if they try to with this bureaucratic thing not a lot of people have
[2:43:56.600 --> 2:44:02.040]  the forms uh that's just going to make people understand how real this is and so i think
[2:44:02.040 --> 2:44:06.120]  they're overreaching right now and i think it's going to backfire because i've seen the polls
[2:44:06.120 --> 2:44:12.120]  you're more aware of this than i am but back in the 70s and 80s they brainwashed close to half the
[2:44:12.120 --> 2:44:16.840]  public to support more reasonable and quote gun control but since then i see most of the polls
[2:44:16.840 --> 2:44:22.280]  70 75 80 percent right the young people are into it liberals i know we're buying guns they learned
[2:44:22.280 --> 2:44:26.520]  mistrust of government under bush now they're starting to not trust obama people are really
[2:44:26.520 --> 2:44:32.120]  fundamentally getting it now and we're winning the hearts and minds in the gun culture the second
[2:44:32.120 --> 2:44:35.640]  amendment culture this country was founded on you know it all started folks when the redcoats
[2:44:35.640 --> 2:44:42.280]  came to take the guns uh i think we're gonna kick their ass i'm sorry to use that term well i hope
[2:44:42.280 --> 2:44:49.080]  that's correct i'm uh i see what you're talking about i and it's you're not making that up on the
[2:44:49.080 --> 2:44:53.640]  other hand we can't forget that the government schools have been doing their job and they've
[2:44:53.640 --> 2:44:59.800]  been cranking out lots of voters that think it's really cool to vote against freedom against liberty
[2:44:59.800 --> 2:45:05.080]  have no idea what my point is i'm not saying we're even winning we're showing some fight we're
[2:45:05.080 --> 2:45:10.520]  growing they're moving against us and i'm telling folks this is the fight this is 1776 part
[2:45:10.520 --> 2:45:17.880]  2 true that in that sense i think you are correct and i would agree because they are going to
[2:45:19.160 --> 2:45:25.880]  substantially alienate a significant minority of the american people and the arrogance that
[2:45:25.880 --> 2:45:33.480]  i've seen in obama which seems to go along with his south chicago thuggishness could very well
[2:45:33.480 --> 2:45:39.960]  end up turning people off and uh well let's hope so well the left he's gone back on every promise
[2:45:39.960 --> 2:45:45.240]  to them the we're starting to see cracks in the facade as they realize he's bought and paid for
[2:45:45.240 --> 2:45:50.200]  by the very same interest you know but i'm getting out here larry pratt is i don't want them to come
[2:45:50.200 --> 2:45:55.400]  after the guns but i know they've been creeping around trying it forever and in a way part of me
[2:45:55.400 --> 2:45:59.720]  just says you know what let's go ahead and get this show on the road you know what you just want
[2:45:59.720 --> 2:46:04.760]  to keep pushing and pushing i know how the country was founded i know how it's going to be founded
[2:46:04.760 --> 2:46:09.160]  again you can't help it you're going to use the military against the second amendment the military
[2:46:09.160 --> 2:46:12.840]  is going to come over to our side and we're going to arrest every one of you foreign bankers
[2:46:12.840 --> 2:46:17.000]  that have been running your scams and we're going to try you with a jury of your peers and you're
[2:46:17.000 --> 2:46:22.280]  going to the hoose count well better sooner than later because they are in the long run
[2:46:22.280 --> 2:46:28.360]  working a very effective plan to dumb down the american people and if they overplay their hand
[2:46:28.360 --> 2:46:36.120]  now better now than sometime in the future i i quite agree that sooner rather than later would be
[2:46:36.120 --> 2:46:41.240]  to our favor yeah let's get the show on the road whether that be peaceful or whatever it is
[2:46:41.240 --> 2:46:45.960]  let's uh you know defend the republic to the end larry pratt i want to really thank you

[2:54:29.720 --> 2:54:36.760]  good afternoon alex hello my friend how you doing um i'm 24 years old and i've been following
[2:54:36.760 --> 2:54:42.360]  um the alternative media and you fight against the new world order and inspired me to go over
[2:54:42.360 --> 2:54:47.720]  to college and take up political science i was wondering how can i use that degree to help people
[2:54:47.720 --> 2:54:52.040]  and fight in the world order well i'm not saying it's bad for you to go to college but you'll just
[2:54:52.040 --> 2:54:55.880]  get in massive debt and they'll teach you a false political paradigm with most political
[2:54:55.880 --> 2:55:00.600]  science degrees but that can also you know help you with that perspective of the of the false
[2:55:01.240 --> 2:55:06.840]  map they download into your brain basically um i wouldn't wait to go get a political science
[2:55:06.840 --> 2:55:11.080]  degree to go out and warn people and wake people up uh but i mean i don't think it's bad for you
[2:55:11.080 --> 2:55:15.640]  to get a degree uh but i mean you're just not going to find a lot of work in government
[2:55:15.640 --> 2:55:22.040]  if you're opposing their criminal operations so do you suggest uh journalism because i thought
[2:55:22.040 --> 2:55:26.440]  about that too yeah but i mean the old media is imploding as people know they're a pack of
[2:55:26.440 --> 2:55:31.800]  criminal liars or a pack of people spinning things uh i mean i started taking rtf in college and
[2:55:32.440 --> 2:55:36.520]  but i went started an access tv show and six months later had a weekend show and six months
[2:55:36.520 --> 2:55:40.840]  after that had a daily show and a year after that had a syndicated show so i mean it's just
[2:55:40.840 --> 2:55:45.480]  best to go out and do it it's best to start a website now or get with somebody and work with them and
[2:55:45.480 --> 2:55:49.480]  you know go out and do citizen reports and then get a sponsor or two and just do it that way
[2:55:50.040 --> 2:55:55.320]  i mean it's best to not wait in life it's best to you know just bust your hind in now and start
[2:55:55.320 --> 2:56:01.720]  reporting on things now i see thanks a lot for your advice alex thank you so much appreciate your

[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:09.880]  there's been a lot of citizen continental congresses i i think really we have the legislatures already
[2:57:09.880 --> 2:57:15.880]  there with the authority we need to go in and have the legislatures say you know the federal
[2:57:15.880 --> 2:57:21.000]  government is now bankrupt and foreign and has been hijacked and the states need to vote
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:25.720]  to reconstitute the federal government and have these people arrested we need to have state grand
[2:57:25.720 --> 2:57:30.600]  juries start indictments i'm not poo pooing bob schultz we need to get him back on a million years
[2:57:30.600 --> 2:57:36.360]  it's just that meeting across from the you know in philadelphia or whatever and coming up with a

[3:01:37.560 --> 3:01:42.680]  or by their mouth you know because of their belief you know we're going to say this let me just say
[3:01:42.680 --> 3:01:50.280]  this they've got police so scared now that i saw two cases this week that i didn't even cover on
[3:01:50.280 --> 3:01:55.320]  air if you thought i was trying to bash police where they pull over unarmed cars the cops just
[3:01:55.320 --> 3:02:00.760]  get out and unload into the car shooting people or they shoot somebody in the back and then say that
[3:02:00.760 --> 3:02:05.720]  i mean what about us we're scared we're tired of being killed am i saying all the police are bad
[3:02:05.720 --> 3:02:12.360]  no but all over texas the police pull you over and say i want your watch give it to me and the person
[3:02:12.360 --> 3:02:18.200]  takes their watch off and okay here's my watch i mean i just read the san antonio express news
[3:02:18.200 --> 3:02:24.040]  one little town where they're stealing everybody's stuff and i mean so what i'm saying is the leadership
[3:02:24.040 --> 3:02:29.480]  of the police is bad the feds of i mean i just covered art a saveta wanting everybody that gets
[3:02:29.480 --> 3:02:33.880]  arrested for a misdemeanor to have their blood taken in a dna database and the feds are telling
[3:02:33.880 --> 3:02:39.720]  them to do that now i know a lot of police and a lot of police send us information and i know a lot
[3:02:39.720 --> 3:02:45.720]  of police are nice and i run into them i understand that but police are so scared of getting blown away
[3:02:45.720 --> 3:02:49.240]  statistically they have a much better chance of being run over or down in a car wreck
[3:02:49.800 --> 3:02:53.080]  they see them hanging their hind ends out in the highway writing tickets all day
[3:02:53.720 --> 3:02:58.120]  you know i mean my whole point is we have a predatory criminal government and tyranny's
[3:02:58.120 --> 3:03:03.720]  going to come to your door in a uniform as officer jack mclean says so i salute good officers i see
[3:03:03.720 --> 3:03:08.760]  police out changing tires i see police out helping and when they do good i say it and i always say
[3:03:08.760 --> 3:03:14.520]  it's not individuals it's the system but i mean sir we're in tyranny in germany the police were
[3:03:14.520 --> 3:03:18.920]  bad in russia the police were bad in china the police are bad i mean do you understand when
[3:03:18.920 --> 3:03:26.760]  you have a bad government the police by extension become that enforcer yes i understand but i just
[3:03:26.760 --> 3:03:32.440]  want to thank god that that our son is not that way and and that you know people he pulls over up here
[3:03:32.440 --> 3:03:39.480]  or will be treated with respect and he is by the constitution also alex i'd like to say one more
[3:03:39.480 --> 3:03:44.600]  thing and i get off here i do praise you for your work on the show and i'm not judging you as such
[3:03:44.600 --> 3:03:51.560]  on that particular subject i'm just saying a lot of people do judge police officers as all of them
[3:03:51.560 --> 3:03:57.400]  are bad no sir they're not i disagree with that with these people no i agree with you i agree with
[3:03:57.400 --> 3:04:03.720]  you but sir a lot of people are in denial and saying none of them are bad i mean do you see what
[3:04:03.720 --> 3:04:10.600]  i'm saying yes we know they are some bad because i saw the news story like you and cop pulls a gun
[3:04:10.600 --> 3:04:14.520]  shoots a guy in the back and he was down on the ground there was nothing he was doing to resist
[3:04:14.520 --> 3:04:19.560]  or anything yes or there are bad cops but i'm just saying i would like for the public to remember
[3:04:19.560 --> 3:04:26.520]  that there are good cops too and and and when we get on these stories about the bad cops and stuff
[3:04:26.520 --> 3:04:32.440]  let's direct it toward the bad cops and let's do remind the public you know there are good cops
[3:04:32.440 --> 3:04:38.680]  let us thank god for the good cops let us pray for the good cops as well now i hear you hey bob
[3:04:38.680 --> 3:04:44.440]  daisy's son is a police officer and he's a great guy i remember when he was a little kid that's how
[3:04:44.440 --> 3:04:50.520]  old i'm getting you know and i mean he's a good guy i'm telling you though the government is evil
[3:04:50.520 --> 3:04:55.880]  it's gone bad and so police need to realize that and say okay we're not with this system
[3:04:55.880 --> 3:05:00.040]  good they can join us like the state houses are hey i appreciate you and your family

[3:08:05.400 --> 3:08:16.360]  on the gcn radio network i want to say this to dan who called about his son being a police officer
[3:08:16.360 --> 3:08:23.640]  and being a patriot i am not perfect in fact i'm far from it and i have said many times on air and
[3:08:23.640 --> 3:08:30.200]  i've apologized for the fact that i've actually helped the new world order inadvertently
[3:08:32.120 --> 3:08:36.920]  because the police are in a gang mentality it's an us against them you know everybody's out to get
[3:08:36.920 --> 3:08:42.840]  them all they can trust is fellow cops that's what they're taught and so when i come out and yell
[3:08:42.840 --> 3:08:47.560]  and scream and hyperventilate at the police that actually helps them get into more of a paranoid
[3:08:47.560 --> 3:08:55.400]  mode more into going along with tyranny but at the same time police are doing unconstitutional
[3:08:55.400 --> 3:09:01.480]  things all over the nation they are basically under a federal directive they their FEMA camps are
[3:09:01.480 --> 3:09:08.200]  being built the police more and more do act like thugs i mean you know i've been all over the
[3:09:08.200 --> 3:09:12.760]  country and asked a cop for directions in galveston texas in new york sitting there like do i look
[3:09:12.760 --> 3:09:18.120]  like a phone book to you like hi officer hey do you know where this is do i know do i look like
[3:09:18.120 --> 3:09:23.320]  a phone book to you i've talked a lot of austin cops who visited new york and they'll hey officer
[3:09:23.320 --> 3:09:29.560]  where's this hey what's your problem here get out of here i talked to the awesome police chief out
[3:09:29.560 --> 3:09:34.600]  there that happened to him in new york a few months ago he said so how do you like being treated
[3:09:34.600 --> 3:09:40.120]  like that but but it's more than that i've had police in austin new york other places walk up and say
[3:09:40.120 --> 3:09:44.040]  turn your cameras off on the street corner you're not allowed to be out here interviewing people
[3:09:44.040 --> 3:09:51.160]  i go but i have a first amendment hey you want me to arrest you right now mr smart pants and you
[3:09:51.160 --> 3:09:55.800]  gotta go okay but i'm gonna sue you for this please don't violate the bill rights constitution
[3:09:55.800 --> 3:10:00.440]  treat me like a human they'll start screaming some more then they'll get ready to arrest you and
[3:10:00.440 --> 3:10:05.960]  then the supervisor comes over and doesn't want trouble and says let him go now i know they're
[3:10:05.960 --> 3:10:09.560]  training the police to dislike the public i know they're training the police to feed on the public
[3:10:09.560 --> 3:10:13.880]  and i know that every major jurisdiction we look at frames people all day long
[3:10:13.880 --> 3:10:18.280]  out of the majority of narcotics officers are really drug dealers and plant drugs on people
[3:10:18.280 --> 3:10:23.080]  and that's on record i know the cia ships in harrowing and cocaine i know that war on drugs
[3:10:23.080 --> 3:10:28.680]  is a fraud i know all over texas the police steal everything you got it's normally smaller
[3:10:28.680 --> 3:10:33.080]  jurisdictions where total corruption takes over the bigger ones just carry out the overall tyranny
[3:10:33.080 --> 3:10:37.640]  but they know to keep the low-level crime down by their officers now are all officers involved in
[3:10:37.640 --> 3:10:44.520]  this no i mean i remember when i was in high school in college i was big into working out worked
[3:10:44.520 --> 3:10:49.480]  out two hours a day wish i had the time today you know nowadays and i worked out at gyms and it was
[3:10:49.480 --> 3:10:53.240]  always cops who were in there and you know they give me spots and you know i remember being like
[3:10:53.240 --> 3:10:56.040]  18 years old and going hey we're going to get something to eat and going to a restaurant
[3:10:56.040 --> 3:11:00.120]  eating something with cops military people you know because i look like that type of person
[3:11:00.120 --> 3:11:05.880]  and i know they're just regular people but the point is they have been incrementally trained
[3:11:05.880 --> 3:11:10.280]  to urinate all over the bill of rights and constitution and i'm not putting up with it
[3:11:10.280 --> 3:11:14.120]  you think the founding fathers hated all the redcoats they a lot of them had been redcoats
[3:11:14.680 --> 3:11:20.920]  been in the british military most of them yeah including george washington they were tired
[3:11:20.920 --> 3:11:27.000]  of it see and look look look i've been there and watch the apd grab a baby out of somebody's arms
[3:11:27.720 --> 3:11:31.960]  with no due process for no reason because it was a poor family and then they knew they could steal it
[3:11:31.960 --> 3:11:38.760]  for the cps and get $400,000 for it on the market i've seen judge gene mirror with the family courts
[3:11:38.760 --> 3:11:42.360]  threatened parents to sign their kids over to the government for being late to class three times
[3:11:42.360 --> 3:11:47.160]  when it's not even a violation of state law the truancy law they're claiming i have seen it
[3:11:47.720 --> 3:11:52.280]  i've gone out in my car after watching them steal babies and broke down and cried like a baby
[3:11:52.280 --> 3:12:00.440]  it's torn my intestines out i'm sick of injustice and i'm sick of the bull and so overall the
[3:12:00.440 --> 3:12:05.880]  i'm tired of the tv ads worshiping the police in the military that's not to worship the police
[3:12:05.880 --> 3:12:10.520]  in the military it's to worship the government and to sell pr because they know the public's
[3:12:10.520 --> 3:12:17.800]  getting sick of it police were in most areas of the society revered and appreciated and you know
[3:12:17.800 --> 3:12:24.440]  why 1500 years ago because they had to go after people when somebody stole somebody's goods they
[3:12:24.440 --> 3:12:28.920]  had to go up against real criminals they had to be in shootouts and hideouts they had to go after
[3:12:28.920 --> 3:12:33.720]  bank robbers and cops were into being macho and tough there was still always corruption because
[3:12:33.720 --> 3:12:38.200]  you're gonna have criminals trying to buy off the police but by and large that's why people didn't
[3:12:38.200 --> 3:12:43.400]  buy cops slices of apple pie and run out and give them coffee in their cars 50 60 years ago
[3:12:43.400 --> 3:12:48.200]  because they were scared of them they liked them they knew them they were on their local beat and
[3:12:48.200 --> 3:12:53.000]  they were watching the neighborhood and you could go out of town and know that bob was going to be
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:12:59.320]  walking around with his partner and and and he knew the community that we don't have that now
[3:12:59.320 --> 3:13:04.920]  they don't want the police to know us they don't want the police to be our friends and i'm tired of it
[3:13:09.160 --> 3:13:13.000]  look i'm going to explain something with the police the military i don't have time to kiss
[3:13:13.000 --> 3:13:18.760]  your butts i don't have time to sit here and play games they are going to steal all your pension
[3:13:18.760 --> 3:13:23.080]  funds if you don't care about us care about yourselves they don't tell you not to drink fluoride
[3:13:23.080 --> 3:13:28.760]  water they don't tell you not to drink aspartame coax they don't tell you how dangerous things are
[3:13:28.760 --> 3:13:34.120]  for you and your family i do i am your friend i want you to do well in life i don't want you to
[3:13:34.120 --> 3:13:40.680]  get shot out there on the streets but i've seen cops time after time all over the country raid
[3:13:40.680 --> 3:13:45.480]  people and say they had an arsenal of guns some old man steal their guns i've seen too much crime
[3:13:45.480 --> 3:13:54.200]  from you i know statistically that you're doing a lot of bad you know there was a time in this nation
[3:13:54.200 --> 3:14:02.200]  where per capita we had a lot less police per population but when a car got stolen
[3:14:03.800 --> 3:14:09.160]  or when somebody got raped the police went absolutely crazy like a bunch of bloodhounds
[3:14:09.160 --> 3:14:16.040]  on a scent now they don't do that they do have a cop gets killed you know over 90% of the time
[3:14:16.040 --> 3:14:20.840]  when a cop gets killed they find the perpetrator does you know only 10 or 11 depending on the year
[3:14:20.840 --> 3:14:26.680]  percent of murders go solved if it's a civilian why are you using military terminology you don't
[3:14:26.680 --> 3:14:35.000]  know why you need to find out police why is the mayor calling people in austin civilians that
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:43.240]  i'm not gonna call him a jackass he or i guess i just did he knows what he's doing the cities are
[3:14:43.240 --> 3:14:48.120]  nothing but systems to scoop up all the tax money and send it offshore through the comprehensive
[3:14:48.120 --> 3:14:55.720]  financial reports the government's much more corrupt than you know you work for it so we
[3:14:56.600 --> 3:14:59.720]  praise the police like officer jack mclean and
[3:14:59.720 --> 3:15:06.840]  um let's get officer jack mclean back on write a note please and i want to get
[3:15:06.840 --> 3:15:11.400]  sheriff richard mackon it's been here since i had him on you know he didn't like how the feds
[3:15:11.400 --> 3:15:15.400]  were pulling people over having handguns doctors and lawyers people know criminal records and
[3:15:15.400 --> 3:15:21.080]  taking him to jail in his county so he sued them went to the supreme court and won a second
[3:15:21.080 --> 3:15:26.680]  amendment case on the tenth amendment the feds don't have any jurisdiction in the states the
[3:15:26.680 --> 3:15:30.920]  states are supposed to have any gun laws and they're gonna have them the only gun law this
[3:15:30.920 --> 3:15:35.800]  country ever had was you got to have them openly see that's the legal trick they say well to have
[3:15:35.800 --> 3:15:40.440]  them concealed you got to get a permit because that's against the law into the constitution
[3:15:40.440 --> 3:15:47.400]  you have arms openly why do you shake hands with somebody that's the old ancient medieval thing of
[3:15:47.400 --> 3:15:53.080]  hey let's shake hands i don't have an arm i'm meeting you on the highway i'm gonna shake hands
[3:15:53.080 --> 3:15:59.000]  with you i'm not about here off the coach road to pull out a dagger and stab you in the stomach or
[3:15:59.000 --> 3:16:06.520]  pull out a musket and shoot you you know i see these national polls where 90 plus percent of
[3:16:06.520 --> 3:16:10.600]  police say they're pro-second amendment well where are you where's your yes are you carrying on
[3:16:10.600 --> 3:16:15.640]  unconstitutional actions look foreign banks have seized the united states i keep repeating that
[3:16:15.640 --> 3:16:19.560]  we're in receivership and if we could just wake up to that and get past the puppet obama
[3:16:19.560 --> 3:16:23.400]  and the puppet bush and all this window dressing and really get down to brass tacks we can turn
[3:16:23.400 --> 3:16:27.640]  this around if not we don't have any future look i'm right about all this stuff we've proven we're
[3:16:27.640 --> 3:16:33.640]  right i try to be friendly towards the police i try to have our day surveyed out here twice
[3:16:33.640 --> 3:16:39.480]  because he's slick and he reaches out to people but frankly he's a going up the federal ladder
[3:16:39.480 --> 3:16:44.600]  and doing stuff it's unbelievable dna databases now he is our day surveyed of the vampire

[3:24:22.760 --> 3:24:25.400]  let me guess uh you live in a small town
[3:24:25.400 --> 3:24:35.160]  where do you live abalone oh abalone is is probably one of the worst you know that's
[3:24:35.160 --> 3:24:40.840]  where the bushies hang out that in midland uh we see some of the worst cases uh in that area time
[3:24:40.840 --> 3:24:47.720]  and time again and what happens is uh people that give out hundreds or thousands of copies and
[3:24:47.720 --> 3:24:52.200]  this is ended up in the newspaper i don't know if you heard me tell the kelly rushing case he was
[3:24:52.200 --> 3:24:57.080]  giving out my my video in a ron paul video and they charged him for my video and the ron paul video
[3:24:57.080 --> 3:25:00.840]  saying it was threatening to police that they didn't like it and it went to court and the jury
[3:25:00.840 --> 3:25:05.720]  found him not guilty of terroristic threats through the videos very nice guy in the community and
[3:25:05.720 --> 3:25:11.560]  he couldn't believe that there'd happen but yes they probably went in your house looking for something
[3:25:11.560 --> 3:25:17.160]  illegal they couldn't find anything and they got mad and see you've got these federally paid for
[3:25:17.160 --> 3:25:22.760]  anti-terror liaison officers in every department a lot of them in big departments they had nothing to
[3:25:22.760 --> 3:25:28.760]  do there are no real terrorists but like the federal marshall said last year in the case of airports
[3:25:28.760 --> 3:25:34.200]  a little kid taking a picture with a camera they're on the terrorist for life uh anything the order
[3:25:34.200 --> 3:25:39.160]  of different meal on the plane terrorist for life they said this is wrong but we have to show there's
[3:25:39.160 --> 3:25:46.200]  a terror threat so uh these guys don't like the fact you're handing videos out in town i mean
[3:25:46.200 --> 3:25:56.120]  have you handed a lot out yes how many i don't know why ballpark ballpark
[3:25:57.480 --> 3:26:05.800]  round 300 400 well the answer is uh you just hand out even more and uh
[3:26:08.440 --> 3:26:11.800]  it's look it's just secret police intimidation and it's going to get worse
[3:26:11.800 --> 3:26:17.000]  you know i've had all sorts of stuff done to me and you know these are criminals and uh
[3:26:20.200 --> 3:26:27.080]  it's disgusting i mean what were you out of town and this happened uh no i just out one day uh
[3:26:27.080 --> 3:26:33.880]  around town spent most of the day and it was late in the evening when i came in and uh
[3:26:33.880 --> 3:26:43.960]  uh i questioned my neighbors of course nobody saw anything but um i was lucky enough when the
[3:26:44.600 --> 3:26:51.560]  Hastings local video buffed them up from he got the scratches out where they all run just as
[3:26:51.560 --> 3:27:01.000]  true as can be thank goodness but uh just looked like they'd taken each one out the master copies
[3:27:01.000 --> 3:27:08.040]  and some of the ones i had sitting in folders ready to go out and took sandpaper or a key or
[3:27:08.040 --> 3:27:13.400]  something and just went back and forth across them what does that tell you the films are doing
[3:27:15.000 --> 3:27:22.040]  it tells someone don't want them seen because they're afraid of especially texans and people
[3:27:22.040 --> 3:27:27.400]  that have a history of fighting back they they know conservatives especially libertarians are upset
[3:27:27.400 --> 3:27:32.280]  they don't want people knowing the full story because if folks find out the true diabolical
[3:27:32.280 --> 3:27:35.880]  nature but it's too late i won't tell the thugs that did this it's too late for you
[3:27:37.000 --> 3:27:43.080]  ten states are moving to stand against you more will move we are going to win this thing with
[3:27:43.080 --> 3:27:57.480]  god's help my friend uh the state of texas has always had the uh right to secede from the union
[3:27:57.480 --> 3:28:04.360]  and if it comes to that right now that would be the ideal thing for us to do it's not a union
[3:28:04.360 --> 3:28:09.480]  anymore it's been hijacked publicly we're under war powers by foreign banks i appreciate your call

[3:34:27.320 --> 3:34:31.320]  seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them
[3:34:32.520 --> 3:34:37.080]  you just don't get your stuff treated now under social health care you like that year and a half
[3:34:37.080 --> 3:34:41.160]  two years from rain tumor to be worked on medicare now pays for treatments deemed safe and effective
[3:34:41.160 --> 3:34:45.480]  the stimulus bill would change that and apply a cost-effectiveness standard set by the federal
[3:34:45.480 --> 3:34:51.560]  council the federal council's model after the uk board discussed in dashel's book and it goes on
[3:34:51.560 --> 3:34:56.200]  to say this is what they're saying you'll you'll have to go blind it's all folks are supposed to
[3:34:56.200 --> 3:35:03.400]  go blind you don't get that surgery i mean that's in the bill we kept telling you people that wanted
[3:35:03.400 --> 3:35:09.720]  socialism it's not even it's eugenics it's controlling the way you live and behavior
[3:35:09.720 --> 3:35:16.840]  well we kept tabs on you your whole life you you were healthy you're you know you're a good bureaucrat
[3:35:16.840 --> 3:35:22.040]  you're part of the party you get health care just just unbelievable
[3:35:24.520 --> 3:35:27.560]  you know there's a bunch of other news i want to go to but first let's take a few more calls
[3:35:27.560 --> 3:35:33.960]  before i do that uh let's go ahead and talk to um who's up next mike and tennessee or was it greg
[3:35:35.000 --> 3:35:39.320]  yeah it's mike and tennessee you're on the air go ahead mike good afternoon alex uh yeah i was
[3:35:39.320 --> 3:35:44.360]  listening to your guest early with the uh gun owners of america and i was at the gun show in
[3:35:44.360 --> 3:35:48.920]  germantown tennessee saturday and there was an nra booth and i walked by and was reading
[3:35:48.920 --> 3:35:53.960]  their information the guy asked if i was a member and i said no and he says well uh why not don't
[3:35:53.960 --> 3:35:58.840]  you support the second amendment i said well yeah i do as a matter of fact and because you're
[3:35:58.840 --> 3:36:05.400]  responsible for sponsoring the 1933 and 1968 gun bands uh i kind of you know how would you guys
[3:36:05.400 --> 3:36:09.560]  responsible for that and since you don't support the second amendment it seems like you support
[3:36:09.560 --> 3:36:14.920]  mostly hunters but not people you know with the second amendment being there for people to bear
[3:36:14.920 --> 3:36:19.560]  arms to protect themselves from a corrupt government you know that's that's what you guys are missing
[3:36:19.560 --> 3:36:26.200]  i wish you'd get on board with us well the guy started yelling at me and um basically one of his
[3:36:26.200 --> 3:36:30.280]  friends next to him jumped up and said he was going to kick my tail but he didn't say tail and
[3:36:30.280 --> 3:36:35.720]  anyway i thought that was quite interesting instead of them being able to debate the the question
[3:36:35.720 --> 3:36:41.240]  about their their sponsorship of these bills they just went on the attack wish i'd had a recorder
[3:36:41.240 --> 3:36:47.160]  on me that that was those guys are just making money there see i've had a lot of gun shop owners
[3:36:47.160 --> 3:36:53.640]  go alex don't tell people the nix is a registration it's not it scares them away yeah that's what
[3:36:53.640 --> 3:36:58.200]  it is a registration it's a registration that you're a gun owner and how many guns you got is
[3:36:58.200 --> 3:37:06.280]  a long arm you know a long rifle shotgun or handgun are you asking me a question no i mean i'm i'm
[3:37:06.280 --> 3:37:13.800]  telling them so something what happened when the guy said i'm gonna kick your butt he told his buddy
[3:37:13.800 --> 3:37:18.440]  to go get the uh the head of the uh the organization who's running the show and of course now is a
[3:37:18.440 --> 3:37:23.320]  radio host in a saddlecast the day before he didn't recognize me and so the guy comes over and says
[3:37:23.320 --> 3:37:26.840]  what's the matter mike and i told him what happened and said well you know i just mentioned the gun
[3:37:26.840 --> 3:37:30.680]  bans and there's two or three people listening and i figured they would either debate me on the
[3:37:30.680 --> 3:37:35.720]  issue or they would you know not say anything i didn't think they're gonna attack me and threaten
[3:37:35.720 --> 3:37:39.880]  you know jump over the counter and kick my bed as they did they said look you know don't listen
[3:37:39.880 --> 3:37:44.040]  those guys you know i'm aware of the bans i'm not a member either then or i just you know they're
[3:37:44.040 --> 3:37:49.640]  just paid sponsors let me stop here right there let me let me only hear more of this notice their
[3:37:49.640 --> 3:37:54.840]  response was they didn't like your speech they were going to use authority to stop you from
[3:37:54.840 --> 3:38:01.640]  speaking remember the articles in missouri and other states where the state police went on tv
[3:38:02.200 --> 3:38:08.360]  and others and said if you criticize obama and tell a lie about him we're going to arrest you
[3:38:08.360 --> 3:38:15.240]  and they decide what a lie is again and then my listeners didn't believe that till i played the
[3:38:15.240 --> 3:38:21.800]  newscast and the newscast was acting like it was normal and kosher so but i mean see how their response
[3:38:21.800 --> 3:38:26.520]  looks i had the same thing happen and make brides a nice gun shop and i know a lot of guys that
[3:38:26.520 --> 3:38:29.800]  worked there but the guy got aggressive he said now looks i would appreciate it wasn't about a
[3:38:29.800 --> 3:38:34.600]  shotgun i would appreciate you lied about bush being for these assault weapons band and i said
[3:38:34.600 --> 3:38:38.920]  it is he's like oh it is huh because it's their false paradigm what are these kind of liberal
[3:38:38.920 --> 3:38:43.560]  and then the manager came over said no he's right he's right alex is right and the guy was like
[3:38:43.560 --> 3:38:49.400]  who but i mean look at their response i'm gonna get you thrown out of here boy you don't tell me
[3:38:49.400 --> 3:38:54.520]  the nr a is a gun control group instead of him saying show me proof let's defend the second
[3:38:54.520 --> 3:38:58.760]  amendment but but i mean so what did they do once they learned that you thank god you were talk show
[3:38:58.760 --> 3:39:03.800]  how's the amount of swat teams you uh uh what happened well he he told me that i couldn't say
[3:39:03.800 --> 3:39:08.920]  that and and i said you asked me a question and of course i'm a free american with a first amendment
[3:39:08.920 --> 3:39:14.280]  right and i can see what i want you don't have to like it but it's the truth and you can't stop me
[3:39:14.280 --> 3:39:19.160]  from saying of course you know that's when they blew up of course they couldn't handle that but
[3:39:19.160 --> 3:39:24.520]  you know i'm just trying to engage the guy on the conversation he asked me he engaged me first
[3:39:24.520 --> 3:39:30.360]  asked me why i wasn't a member and i informed him why and pointed out the reasons why and and
[3:39:30.360 --> 3:39:35.320]  challenged him to you know correct their errors in their ways in the past i said if you guys would
[3:39:35.320 --> 3:39:39.480]  get on board with us the americans that are supporting the second amendment for what it was
[3:39:39.480 --> 3:39:45.000]  designed for you know we'll support you but until you do i have no interest in being a part of your
[3:39:45.000 --> 3:39:51.800]  affiliation so and what did he say then well i mean that's that's basically when the guy got
[3:39:51.800 --> 3:39:57.080]  hostile and and the guy that looked like job of the head probably 450 pound guy he's you know he's
[3:39:57.080 --> 3:40:00.600]  the one that said he was going to break that and jump over the table and attack me and kick my
[3:40:00.600 --> 3:40:05.400]  butt of course i'm 65 but you know pounds and not really worried about the guy to be honest with you
[3:40:05.400 --> 3:40:11.720]  but it was interesting his tactic his his attack on me that i had to shut up and leave
[3:40:11.720 --> 3:40:16.280]  and or they were going to kick my butt and instead of discussing the civilly and maybe
[3:40:16.280 --> 3:40:22.440]  talking about their history oh no i didn't want to do that but see notice he made the
[3:40:22.440 --> 3:40:27.400]  terroristic threat i mean that's punishable by jail time i'm gonna kick your butt i'm gonna
[3:40:27.400 --> 3:40:32.360]  physically assault you i'm gonna come over this table and kick your ass and and then you're sitting
[3:40:32.360 --> 3:40:38.600]  there and and and then they go call and and try to tattle tail right right the head of the uh
[3:40:38.600 --> 3:40:43.640]  the sponsor that the people that were running the organization and uh you know this fellow his his
[3:40:43.640 --> 3:40:47.800]  thing is just to try to make pieces okay might just stay away from him i'll tell him to stay away
[3:40:47.800 --> 3:40:52.600]  from you blah blah blah here i was going to get the guys to come on the assemble cast and talk about
[3:40:52.600 --> 3:40:58.280]  what they're up to and uh you know that that never happened that wasn't in there but the funny
[3:40:58.280 --> 3:41:04.280]  thing is this is interesting i went to half of the people there that were gun dealers and vendors
[3:41:04.280 --> 3:41:09.000]  none of them want to come on the radio because they were concerned about the government identifying them
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:13.960]  oh yeah because they harass gun shops and gun dealers that stand up for the second amendment
[3:41:13.960 --> 3:41:21.080]  we're living in a climate of intimidation and i run into the batf i mean these guys these guys
[3:41:21.080 --> 3:41:26.440]  look like real criminals i mean not guys trying to act like criminals they were all about six two
[3:41:26.440 --> 3:41:31.960]  muscular shaved heads goatee statues and they're just like you know at the times i run into them
[3:41:31.960 --> 3:41:37.400]  and they're like damn right we're bringing america down you're right uh yeah and i mean you know i mean
[3:41:37.400 --> 3:41:41.720]  there i mean these people are sick man they are sick i just want to kick them out of the country
[3:41:41.720 --> 3:41:47.320]  man i want to just take the country back and do exactly what george washington did and say look
[3:41:47.320 --> 3:41:53.480]  leave the country one last thing alex my first my second show i had a local gun shop spent ten
[3:41:53.480 --> 3:41:58.840]  dollars on a single ad i before the election i said the election is tuesday today is sunday
[3:41:58.840 --> 3:42:02.920]  tomorrow's monday the only gun shop open i said the name of the gun shop i said that three times in
[3:42:02.920 --> 3:42:09.000]  one minute that was my my slick ad that was it monday the bureau i called back on farms visited
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:14.120]  this dealer said why are you advertising on this show the area supervisor the guy shop dealer talked
[3:42:14.120 --> 3:42:19.320]  him at the show hadn't talked him since he finally revealed to me the area supervisor for the batf
[3:42:19.320 --> 3:42:26.680]  visited him said don't advertise anymore i will pull your plug that's america that's how i mean
[3:42:26.680 --> 3:42:33.000]  folks that is what we're instead of that guy saying you know what well no you you don't want to tell
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:38.360]  them then or or or the batf would have planted a hanger date oh really happened you know probably
[3:42:38.360 --> 3:42:42.520]  blasting right in the chest i'm not kidding i mean they bombed oklahoma city it was the batf did that
[3:42:43.240 --> 3:42:47.160]  and we caught him red-handed but the point here is he should have gone public he should have made a
[3:42:47.160 --> 3:42:51.400]  big stink out of it and said i'm being politically persecuted then they wouldn't get within a hundred
[3:42:51.400 --> 3:42:56.920]  miles of them but let me guess the gun shop is is going to live in the soviet union they're
[3:42:56.920 --> 3:43:01.480]  going to do what they're told and just wait to be shut down anyways he is the last gun shop in
[3:43:01.480 --> 3:43:06.120]  the small town of covington tennessee brian tennessee's got one millington's down to one

[3:44:01.400 --> 3:44:05.480]  gets a lot of boss what's that famous case where the world war two vets came back and their whole

[3:44:22.440 --> 3:44:28.840]  do anything it's pathetic well good to hear from you i appreciate the call i'm gonna play a video
[3:44:28.840 --> 3:44:34.360]  clip and then get into some financial news analyze it's far worse than what the associated press
[3:44:34.360 --> 3:44:41.960]  is saying uh right over here on the screen on this pentagon pr spending raises propaganda concerns
[3:44:42.520 --> 3:44:47.400]  this what they mentioned is a fraction of pentagon propaganda the pentagon is domestically
[3:44:47.400 --> 3:44:52.920]  engaging blogs it's hired tens of thousands of private contractors to go out on blogs say lies
[3:44:52.920 --> 3:44:59.160]  threaten people they spend billions of dollars in propaganda placement movies and tv not just the
[3:44:59.160 --> 3:45:05.720]  overt ads or three doors down uh video propaganda and the pentagon admits yeah we're we're propagandizing
[3:45:05.720 --> 3:45:09.640]  the american people what's wrong with that they're running shy ops because the pentagon
[3:45:10.920 --> 3:45:15.560]  doesn't work for the american people the pentagon works for the offshore banks that have hijacked
[3:45:15.560 --> 3:45:27.160]  this nation let's go ahead and play part of the clip troops on the move guns blasting it's what one
[3:45:27.160 --> 3:45:33.560]  first thinks of when it comes to the military but now the pentagon is expanding a third front
[3:45:33.560 --> 3:45:39.320]  the defense department is ramping up its spending as it delves further into shaping public opinion
[3:45:39.320 --> 3:45:46.200]  around the world and at home this is a fight for the human terrain means that uh being able to
[3:45:46.200 --> 3:45:54.760]  influence uh populations uh to to support government objectives you at influence populations
[3:45:54.760 --> 3:45:58.920]  the american people we're supposed to influence the government it's our government but now i played
[3:45:58.920 --> 3:46:03.240]  that clip they talked about martial law and the military and where their problem how it's us against
[3:46:03.240 --> 3:46:08.840]  them see they're influencing it's what you see the propaganda is everywhere now it's just it's
[3:46:08.840 --> 3:46:14.120]  just brainwashing and the army recruiters and marine recruiters threatening kids who arrest them
[3:46:14.120 --> 3:46:19.960]  if they don't sign the form to join uh it's just criminal not just u.s. objectives but
[3:46:19.960 --> 3:46:25.400]  the objectives of the country that we're supporting in a fight against insurgents or terrorists it's
[3:46:25.400 --> 3:46:31.720]  a fight the pentagon is taking seriously in all its spending nearly five billion dollars with more
[3:46:31.720 --> 3:46:38.440]  than 27 000 people working to get its message out however some in congress are questioning if it's
[3:46:38.440 --> 3:46:45.320]  also breaking the law by engaging in domestic propaganda i want to make sure that the taxpayers
[3:46:45.320 --> 3:46:53.480]  money is not being used by government agencies for covert propaganda directed at american
[3:46:53.480 --> 3:46:59.560]  citizens in this country programs in question are as wide ranging as the military itself
[3:46:59.560 --> 3:47:06.040]  a program called hometown news is partly run out of this office in san antonio here staffers put
[3:47:06.040 --> 3:47:11.880]  together print radio and television stories that they send out to thousands of news outlets across
[3:47:11.880 --> 3:47:23.640]  the country some of it is as yeah this is all a whitewash i mean it's fake stuff tv ads uh
[3:47:23.640 --> 3:47:29.240]  inside movies propaganda anti-gun statements they pay for because they work for wall street
[3:47:29.240 --> 3:47:34.760]  that's offshore that's busy looting the country and it's north com's job to make sure the enslavement
[3:47:34.760 --> 3:47:38.600]  of the american people to take over by foreign corporations happens and i told you that years
[3:47:38.600 --> 3:47:42.760]  ago it's now on record the army war college it's now on record the naval war college
[3:47:42.760 --> 3:47:48.440]  s says their job is to secure the the american people to make sure we go along with this
[3:47:48.440 --> 3:47:53.400]  and to make sure the trillions every year and no bid contracts go to the big defense contractors
[3:47:53.400 --> 3:47:58.520]  but see they produce all this fake news and then offer it free or pay to have it run on your local
[3:47:58.520 --> 3:48:04.360]  news and you never know it was paid for going to a holiday greetings from soldiers far from home
[3:48:04.360 --> 3:48:10.200]  and getting others to enlist but others are stories that look like any other news item
[3:48:10.200 --> 3:48:15.960]  and the public is not told it was produced by the military this is what we do for the civilian media
[3:48:15.960 --> 3:48:21.080]  to put the good news out there and and to spread that military word back to the hometowns where
[3:48:21.080 --> 3:48:27.080]  these guys and gals are from at fort bragg in north carolina soldiers work on what they're
[3:48:27.080 --> 3:48:33.720]  doing is taking over the united states fema camps civilian uh general james l jones national
[3:48:33.720 --> 3:48:38.520]  security council with no congressional approval is taking over every federal agency that's the
[3:48:38.520 --> 3:48:44.200]  washington post uh here's defense link and in here it mentions the military is now going to work
[3:48:44.200 --> 3:48:51.080]  with homeland security fighting gangs that's here at the uh body this is it's tax i can't even cover
[3:48:51.080 --> 3:48:56.040]  all this how bad it is like nazi germany they're taking over and they all feel real they all buy
[3:48:56.040 --> 3:49:03.000]  their own kool-aid these guys all buy their own kool-aid some experts believe it's only
[3:49:03.000 --> 3:49:07.560]  a matter of time before transnational terrorism organizations link up across the u.s border
[3:49:07.560 --> 3:49:12.120]  this is a concern for local state and federal emergency agencies but given the expanded
[3:49:12.120 --> 3:49:16.920]  role of u.s military domestic defense might also become a concern for the pentagon there's a section

[3:55:27.000 --> 3:55:32.120]  always has intrinsic value all the evidence shows is going to go straight up was two hundred
[3:55:32.120 --> 3:55:36.280]  eighty bucks once you started plugging it now it's nine hundred something i believe it's going
[3:55:36.280 --> 3:55:44.760]  to go well over a thousand but regardless regardless of this uh it is and it has intrinsic value
[3:55:44.760 --> 3:55:51.240]  and as an investment they can't destroy okay so ladies and gentlemen i want you to take action
[3:55:51.240 --> 3:55:58.280]  ted anderson just four weeks ago was selling gold for seven hundred and fifteen bucks an ounce here
[3:55:59.160 --> 3:56:02.920]  and he ran out of that when it was eight hundred and fifty bucks he passed on that savings now
[3:56:03.480 --> 3:56:08.360]  he bought a bunch of gold and silver when it was at eight hundred and thirty he's still selling it
[3:56:08.360 --> 3:56:14.680]  with that price factored in uh you know when the market was at eight thirty now he is at the very
[3:56:14.680 --> 3:56:20.680]  tail end of all of it and you see it go up uh you know he uh this will probably the last time
[3:56:20.680 --> 3:56:25.880]  we're not sure ted got some you know big purchases in here at the end ted tell folks what you have
[3:56:25.880 --> 3:56:29.800]  left at that eight thirty level though gold's been staying right up there above nine hundred
[3:56:30.440 --> 3:56:35.720]  well just yesterday uh we finally received a thousand uh francs that we ordered in at that
[3:56:35.720 --> 3:56:40.520]  level at that eight thirty level and uh we also picked up a bunch of british sovereigns i can't
[3:56:40.520 --> 3:56:45.560]  remember the count on those uh currently i just looked again today if i price them out the francs
[3:56:45.560 --> 3:56:50.840]  are at two twenty eight although this group is at two hundred and seventeen so you get to buy out of
[3:56:50.840 --> 3:56:56.120]  that group which is gonna save you a ton of money british sovereigns currently right now two seventy
