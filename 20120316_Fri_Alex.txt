[00:00.000 --> 00:12.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.440 --> 00:37.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:37.160 --> 00:47.920]  it is Friday the 16th day of March 2012 and we're going to be live here for the
[00:47.920 --> 00:59.320]  next three hours I am going to attempt to at least mention the headline and give
[00:59.320 --> 01:03.920]  you an analysis comment on all these articles I've got here because it's it's
[01:03.920 --> 01:08.080]  all very very important and some of it extremely interesting I got rather
[01:08.080 --> 01:14.200]  focused on things like a record skydive from 13 miles above the earth in a
[01:14.200 --> 01:22.240]  space suit incredible photos that are with that article and radio listeners
[01:22.240 --> 01:29.920]  can watch at prisonplanet.tv when we get to that just a little bit later we are
[01:29.920 --> 01:37.640]  going to have a congressperson joining us later in the second hour to deal with
[01:37.640 --> 01:40.600]  some very important developments in Congress but I'll just leave it at that
[01:40.600 --> 01:48.080]  and then we are going to have Patrick Henningson who's an American but who's
[01:48.080 --> 01:54.920]  visiting here from England where he writes for info wars.com he is going to
[01:54.920 --> 02:04.040]  be joining us and overlapping with a lady that goes by the Ugandan girl whose
[02:04.040 --> 02:08.400]  video one version has been seen over three million times where she says look
[02:08.400 --> 02:15.200]  what you're seeing in this Coney 2012 film is not the reality of what's going
[02:15.200 --> 02:25.400]  on now expanding on that information George Clooney has gone to the White
[02:25.400 --> 02:29.720]  House and they're doing all this is part of a coordinated campaign the Coney
[02:29.720 --> 02:34.120]  2012 thing comes out oh here's the new demon we've got to invade oh Africa wants
[02:34.120 --> 02:37.680]  to go into nine countries oh the French and the Australians the British
[02:37.680 --> 02:43.240]  special forces and US special forces are already there oh they just had a
[02:43.240 --> 02:48.200]  conviction at the World Court ICC which is totally a legitimate with Angelina
[02:48.200 --> 02:53.600]  Jolie there angrily you know in the gallery glaring at the criminal because
[02:53.600 --> 03:01.440]  she is a wondrous good little hero and we need the ICC to arrest more people and
[03:01.440 --> 03:06.160]  also for environmental crimes and world government is the answer and then
[03:06.160 --> 03:15.480]  George Clooney he goes to the White House and he comes out and says oh my
[03:15.480 --> 03:21.520]  gosh I'm spurring the president to want to do something militarily in Sudan so
[03:21.520 --> 03:28.000]  it it it's there to create the perception that the people are calling for
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.200]  these wars and that the wars are humanitarian when you read the State
[03:32.200 --> 03:35.840]  Department documents that we go over the different memorandums it's all about
[03:35.840 --> 03:40.360]  going in there and overthrowing countries or propping up countries that
[03:40.360 --> 03:44.080]  are doing what the globalist want and taking out groups of people who are
[03:44.080 --> 03:49.760]  good bad indifferent it varies in the name of humanitarianism but it's all
[03:49.760 --> 03:54.720]  about natural resource power grabs and then some send me emails a minority of
[03:54.720 --> 04:06.280]  people and they say well Alex we need to be in places like Uganda because you
[04:06.280 --> 04:09.720]  know what even though our government's bad Joseph Coney's bad and he needs to
[04:09.720 --> 04:14.720]  be dealt with and besides we do need those resources there's this idea like
[04:14.720 --> 04:18.040]  well it's humanitarian but hey we're getting something I mean I've had good
[04:18.040 --> 04:21.920]  old boys for years go hey Alex I know it's probably a moral being I right but
[04:21.920 --> 04:28.200]  we need the oil we don't get the oil it's all about the big oil companies
[04:28.200 --> 04:32.120]  keeping prices high they've been caught doing that being able to create cartels
[04:32.120 --> 04:36.040]  and shut down the amount they were mad at Saddam because he was quote over
[04:36.040 --> 04:40.680]  pumping remember that OPEC kept getting mad because he wanted to pay off his
[04:40.680 --> 04:44.520]  debts for the Iran-Iraq war so he was selling more than what OPEC said he
[04:44.520 --> 04:49.280]  could remember how low oil prices were they fixed that though for the Iraq
[04:49.280 --> 04:54.240]  war eight years ago what was gas like two dollars a gallon oh you sure got that
[04:54.240 --> 04:58.320]  free oil didn't you now you got ripped off because the big oil companies hey
[04:58.320 --> 05:03.680]  you as much as they hate the Iraqis when you're out on the road the last place
[05:03.680 --> 05:10.400]  you want to be is on the road but if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you
[05:10.400 --> 05:16.120]  were wearing diamond gussets there's a place down in Tennessee

[05:57.840 --> 06:04.320]  others don't a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why
[06:04.320 --> 06:07.840]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my
[06:07.840 --> 06:12.200]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[06:12.200 --> 06:15.600]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[06:15.600 --> 06:20.240]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace
[06:20.240 --> 06:24.880]  elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be
[06:24.880 --> 06:29.640]  healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there

[07:02.400 --> 07:06.880]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[07:06.880 --> 07:10.920]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[07:10.920 --> 07:14.840]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[07:14.840 --> 07:18.840]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[07:18.840 --> 07:23.400]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[07:23.400 --> 07:27.400]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[07:27.400 --> 07:31.200]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[07:31.200 --> 07:34.840]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[07:34.840 --> 07:39.200]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[07:39.200 --> 07:42.360]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[07:42.360 --> 07:46.040]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[07:46.040 --> 07:51.600]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com

[07:56.360 --> 08:06.760]  1-877-327-0365 he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[08:06.760 --> 08:09.200]  network
[08:13.840 --> 08:20.080]  they got a power-packed transmission lined up for you today we have a
[08:20.080 --> 08:26.200]  congressperson joining us I'm just gonna leave that as a surprise and it
[08:26.200 --> 08:29.440]  deals with an issue that has been on our radar screen in a big way I'll just
[08:29.440 --> 08:35.520]  leave it at that but we're gonna surprise you with that congressional visit to
[08:35.520 --> 08:40.560]  the show and that is locked down correct Chris 100% that's locked down to
[08:40.560 --> 08:45.880]  that Congress congressman's on okay good okay fantastic that's good I just
[08:45.880 --> 08:50.160]  want to leave it as a surprise because well I have my reasons now that's coming
[08:50.160 --> 08:58.320]  up later in the broadcast in the second hour Sunya a young lady from Uganda who
[08:58.320 --> 09:03.360]  has both her parents are from Uganda she has put out a very eloquent video and
[09:03.360 --> 09:06.280]  I've done the research it's very accurate it's been seen more than three
[09:06.280 --> 09:12.640]  million times countering the Coney 2012 State Department Billa Melinda Gates
[09:12.640 --> 09:18.840]  George Soros invasion propaganda and she's gonna be popping in with us as is
[09:18.840 --> 09:24.680]  our writer Patrick Henningson who is visiting the United States he is a US
[09:24.680 --> 09:29.760]  citizen but he works in England and he's gonna be joining us in studio to talk
[09:29.760 --> 09:35.440]  about Coney 2012 and these new proxy wars being launched around the world it
[09:35.440 --> 09:40.680]  doesn't mean that Coney's a good guy it just means this war is about resource
[09:40.680 --> 09:45.600]  grabbing that's why we're against it we're not saying that Gaddafi is a good
[09:45.600 --> 09:49.840]  guy the point is he was working with the West building up his country now it is in
[09:49.840 --> 09:53.720]  a bombed out shambles exactly what the globalists wanted they were not trying
[09:53.720 --> 09:59.640]  to bring freedom Gaddafi was not attacking protesters in fact if they
[09:59.640 --> 10:04.640]  were Al Qaeda forces armed by the West and that's now admitted even in the LA
[10:04.640 --> 10:07.840]  Times and they're lining the blacks up and telling them that's why we were
[10:07.840 --> 10:14.480]  against that war we're not saying that the quasi dictator Assad who by the way
[10:14.480 --> 10:18.320]  has been reforming that's why he's being rewarded with this he did take the iron
[10:18.320 --> 10:24.480]  fist off that let the West bring in its CIA Mossad and my six agitators so all
[10:24.480 --> 10:29.840]  of that is going on and that's why we've been against all these humanitarian
[10:29.840 --> 10:34.320]  wars now I'm gonna get into all the other world news and open the phones up
[10:34.320 --> 10:37.640]  here because we're gonna be covering this in the third hour I just wanted to
[10:37.640 --> 10:42.280]  point out to everybody that you know when they're about to launch new wars
[10:42.280 --> 10:47.240]  because you see the propaganda provocations and when you see Coney
[10:47.240 --> 10:52.960]  12 come out last week now about 10 days ago you see all the mainstream corporate
[10:52.960 --> 10:58.920]  media praising it you see the colleges flooded with the propaganda they're
[10:58.920 --> 11:03.600]  here at South by Southwest and Austin posters trucks huge money behind it
[11:03.600 --> 11:10.200]  it's not about helping Africans when all this globalist money George Soros
[11:10.200 --> 11:15.040]  Billimala negates all of them get behind something it's being done to launch a
[11:15.040 --> 11:22.000]  new war and we've now confirmed doing the research and we've written articles
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.200]  about it I've done a video titled secrets Coney 2012 is desperate to hide
[11:26.200 --> 11:37.440]  it's up at info wars.com that breaks down every facet of this and we prove
[11:37.440 --> 11:41.240]  that well quite frankly it was worse than I even thought a week ago that it's
[11:41.240 --> 11:45.840]  purely Samantha Powers at the White House purely the Big Tax Free Foundations
[11:45.840 --> 11:49.320]  and there's all these white papers where they say we're gonna rebrand war as
[11:49.320 --> 11:53.720]  peace we're gonna call the humanitarian we're gonna fund proxy groups to attack
[11:53.720 --> 11:57.000]  governments we want to get rid of then we're gonna say that they're peaceful
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.360]  protesters as they use the machine guns we gave them and rocket launchers to
[12:01.360 --> 12:05.040]  blow stuff up then we're gonna come in with special forces and aircraft
[12:05.040 --> 12:09.440]  behind them and overthrow the governments or if we're for a government
[12:09.440 --> 12:14.680]  like the Ugandan genocidal government of 26 years but that government's having
[12:14.680 --> 12:18.800]  trouble with our weapons killing all the villagers and running all the people
[12:18.800 --> 12:23.200]  off their land where people actually have the deed entitled their land when
[12:23.200 --> 12:26.160]  when these tribes give us trouble we'll just say hey we'll pick somebody like
[12:26.160 --> 12:32.520]  Coney hadn't been seen in almost six years and we'll just hype up hey there's a
[12:32.520 --> 12:38.160]  bad man five minutes of hate directly out of 1984 and attack the country and
[12:38.160 --> 12:43.320]  so that's what's going on that's what's happening that's what's developing right
[12:43.320 --> 12:50.000]  now and we're going to be breaking it down we're going to be covering it now
[12:50.000 --> 12:57.680]  right on clockwork exactly as we predicted you got Coney 2012 come out
[12:57.680 --> 13:02.560]  you've got the ICC announcing a conviction of an African warlord for
[13:02.560 --> 13:06.480]  using child soldiers which amounts things good but they all do it and that's
[13:06.480 --> 13:09.120]  better than the UN just lining you up and blowing your head off or funding a
[13:09.120 --> 13:12.560]  group to do it but again that's trendy and liberal when you do that you know
[13:12.560 --> 13:16.120]  when you shoot people up with HIV or shoot them up with steroids that's nice
[13:16.120 --> 13:21.040]  when you shoot them up with live polio and they die you know that's nice when
[13:21.040 --> 13:25.920]  you cut off their resources and fund a country to attack its neighbor that's
[13:25.920 --> 13:30.680]  nice because you know it's all right because for every you know group of
[13:30.680 --> 13:34.520]  people you swatter you have a bunch of the starving kids that you've actually
[13:34.520 --> 13:38.600]  cut the food off to then you pull up with a truck set up a tent and have
[13:38.600 --> 13:42.880]  Angelina Jolie or George Clooney get out there and drop some rice in their hands
[13:42.880 --> 13:47.080]  as the little skeletal people dying you know beg for food and people say look
[13:47.080 --> 13:50.200]  at those Africans they don't even know how to feed themselves and while they go
[13:50.200 --> 13:54.120]  where there's food well they can't go with their food because they're under
[13:54.120 --> 14:00.880]  attack then the UN will use the last mass murder that they've organized just
[14:00.880 --> 14:06.040]  as memorandum 200 of the State Department stated use war use famine use proxy
[14:06.040 --> 14:09.880]  armies use neighbors attacking neighbors to reduce population they then point at
[14:09.880 --> 14:16.560]  the carnage and say oh my gosh raise money for us to protect everyone raise
[14:16.560 --> 14:27.760]  money for us to go in and help people and they they for every you know group of
[14:27.760 --> 14:34.200]  people that they engage in carnage against versus who they actually help
[14:34.200 --> 14:38.160]  there are some people that that the UN and these orphanages and people actually
[14:38.160 --> 14:43.960]  help but that's always done just for appearances and just enough to get the
[14:43.960 --> 14:48.440]  trendies in Hollywood and in the clothing lines and in the cosmetic
[14:48.440 --> 14:53.320]  industries I mean it is the big cause celeb it's a giant industry that all
[14:53.320 --> 14:58.520]  these big celebs many of them have these large tax-free foundations where they
[14:58.520 --> 15:03.040]  actually their helicopters their homes their businesses are all tax-free and
[15:03.040 --> 15:08.160]  they'll be like Bono who gives less than one and a half percent of the profits
[15:08.160 --> 15:14.240]  which are tax-free to the Africans and then when that's done it's only for PR
[15:14.240 --> 15:20.320]  purposes and Bill and Melinda Gates do the same thing it is totally cold-blooded
[15:20.320 --> 15:23.720]  instead of paying taxes Bill and Melinda Gates put 80 billion in a tax-free
[15:23.720 --> 15:31.360]  foundation and then now their businesses operate and make profits and then only
[15:31.360 --> 15:35.960]  part of the profit actually goes to help the Africans so I've been spending a
[15:35.960 --> 15:39.520]  lot of time on this because the big rollout has happened now you know in the
[15:39.520 --> 15:46.240]  Obama deception three and a half years ago we laid out how into the name of
[15:46.240 --> 15:50.440]  humanitarian intervention and going out for strongmen that they would invade and
[15:50.440 --> 15:58.760]  we list Uganda we list Sudan we list Libya we list Egypt when we show and
[15:58.760 --> 16:03.200]  list who they're going to invade and how they're going to do it and you know
[16:03.200 --> 16:07.920]  how we did that the very State Department that was in charge then even
[16:07.920 --> 16:11.680]  though Bush had just left office we were making the film when he was still
[16:11.680 --> 16:16.320]  president and Obama was president-elect we knew the policy we knew the next phase
[16:16.320 --> 16:20.080]  they were going to switch from overt we've got to attack all these countries
[16:20.080 --> 16:25.600]  because WMD's in al-Qaeda to oh al-Qaeda is now good and we're going to use al-Qaeda
[16:25.600 --> 16:30.120]  in all these countries sometimes they use al-Qaeda to attack the government
[16:30.120 --> 16:34.240]  other times they say we're going to invade because of al-Qaeda when al-Qaeda
[16:34.240 --> 16:38.040]  publicly works for them or they say we've got to get this Christian warlord
[16:38.040 --> 16:42.360]  with the Lord's resistance army Joseph Coney so it doesn't matter because the
[16:42.360 --> 16:45.960]  public's not really paying attention it's just hey here's a new guy he's worse
[16:45.960 --> 16:50.160]  than Hitler we're going to invade and you can always tell it's telltale because
[16:50.160 --> 16:54.560]  they love a boogeyman nobody's seen for years that's that's a big telltale
[16:54.560 --> 17:00.080]  because somebody who isn't really dead or hidden in some secret prison they're
[17:00.080 --> 17:05.760]  going to speak out they're not going to play along so the telltale sign of a
[17:05.760 --> 17:11.880]  bin Laden or a Coney is they're already dead and so you but you use a boogeyman
[17:11.880 --> 17:17.640]  who's dead because then they can't argue and that's why you gondons all over the
[17:17.640 --> 17:21.440]  country minutes all over the news are going well none of this is even true
[17:21.440 --> 17:24.720]  nobody's seen this guy in almost six years and he was a very small force at
[17:24.720 --> 17:29.400]  the time and whatever's left of his group is on a couple hundred square miles
[17:29.400 --> 17:36.240]  in the north and isn't even a factor well what is this our problem is the
[17:36.240 --> 17:39.960]  government's taken our property and but that's the cover why are US troops going
[17:39.960 --> 17:43.400]  to be there why is increased funding going to take place because they're
[17:43.400 --> 17:49.520]  going to move people off their land at gunpoint and that's admitted and that's
[17:49.520 --> 17:53.320]  why I get angry and Angelina Joe Lee and George Clooney now you've seen all this
[17:53.320 --> 17:56.880]  rollout all this PR what's the government going to do making it look like
[17:56.880 --> 18:01.320]  it's the people and I'm not saying what's happening in Sudan is good you've
[18:01.320 --> 18:06.080]  got the Muslims killing Christians for a very very long time you've got the West
[18:06.080 --> 18:11.160]  quietly involved financing both sides I don't like what the Muslim groups are
[18:11.160 --> 18:14.800]  doing there to Christians this isn't even for me a Muslim-Christian issue it's
[18:14.800 --> 18:19.320]  just that that's the just like they use Muslims as the pretext to go after the
[18:19.320 --> 18:23.680]  Serbs not saying the Serbs were blameless or guiltless the point is that if
[18:23.680 --> 18:27.400]  you look at the numbers the Croats and the Muslims roughly in the UN admits
[18:27.400 --> 18:33.840]  this killed double what the Serbs did in all those conflicts in the Balkans so
[18:33.840 --> 18:37.400]  why did the UN side with the Muslims in that case because they were going after
[18:37.400 --> 18:40.800]  the most powerful group in the area of the Serbs to break them up and weaken
[18:40.800 --> 18:45.280]  them the globalist admit their strategy is micro stakes the globalist admit that
[18:45.280 --> 18:50.680]  it's a strategy of tension and of inner sectarian fighting and so now you see
[18:50.680 --> 18:53.800]  George Clooney he goes to the White House he says I think Obama's gonna do
[18:53.800 --> 18:57.920]  something about Sudan right as all this is being launched right as we're
[18:57.920 --> 19:02.680]  hearing oh Afrikaans going in after the bases are built and set up this is the
[19:02.680 --> 19:08.760]  new beachhead going into Uganda going into Sudan going in to Tanzania going
[19:08.760 --> 19:14.200]  into Kenya they're talking about Kenya go again the West will destabilize it
[19:14.200 --> 19:17.520]  through proxies and then come in now he's been arrested at the Sudanese
[19:17.520 --> 19:23.280]  Embassy storming the embassy tried to walk in and talk to him notice they
[19:23.280 --> 19:27.080]  arrested him because they wanted publicity they didn't arrest me twice when I
[19:27.080 --> 19:31.080]  stormed the Texas Capitol over the TSA because they knew it was a unifying
[19:31.080 --> 19:35.160]  issue that everybody's angry about and the police were told just stand down as
[19:35.160 --> 19:38.800]  I marched there with hundreds of people screaming at them screaming at the
[19:38.800 --> 19:41.760]  politicians I went in the governor's office and screamed at them but they'd
[19:41.760 --> 19:46.160]  all been told to stand down don't give Jones attention on a real issue but on
[19:46.160 --> 19:51.320]  the Clooney thing oh my gosh poor guy got arrested he's this hero Clooney is smart

[25:22.200 --> 25:26.120]  what they want to do here and this is what they'll get away with if we let
[25:26.120 --> 25:31.320]  them now just briefly finishing up with this whole new PR rollout you've heard
[25:31.320 --> 25:35.080]  of WMDs in Iraq you've heard of babies thrown out of incubators you've heard of
[25:35.080 --> 25:43.160]  Gaddafi rape gangs and people fueled by Viagra all lies but you find out it's a
[25:43.160 --> 25:47.440]  lie after the war is launched that's why when you're talking to known liars
[25:47.440 --> 25:51.220]  you're an idiot if after someone's lied to you hundreds of times have been
[25:51.220 --> 25:57.120]  caught then you still trust them I think people just feel powerless so they
[25:57.120 --> 26:00.440]  just decide to be comfortable with the fact that you're being lied to but
[26:00.440 --> 26:05.400]  George Clooney arrested at Sudanese embassy so he goes over to Obama's
[26:05.400 --> 26:09.400]  White House office and says I want you to do something about the problems in
[26:09.400 --> 26:17.200]  Sudan and the answer is well we'll just send in the United Nations to a
[26:17.200 --> 26:24.120]  rest the leader there and what does Coney say Coney says the same thing they
[26:24.120 --> 26:27.520]  say look this is about awareness of all of Africa we want to help people
[26:27.520 --> 26:34.840]  everywhere and there's Clooney with the Coney the Clooney Coney connection he's
[26:34.840 --> 26:39.520]  the good humanitarian he's the good actor he's the one that cares about you
[26:39.520 --> 26:43.520]  he supports taking your guns he supports taking your property
[26:43.520 --> 26:49.080]  agenda 21 he supports open borders he supports globalism he's a good guy the
[26:49.080 --> 26:56.200]  corporate horde media told you so and he's nothing but a manufactured
[26:56.200 --> 27:02.080]  globalist he's nothing but an empty suit who thinks you're all a big joke and
[27:02.080 --> 27:08.280]  we tell you somebody like Clooney who is smart he knows full well the stunts he's
[27:08.280 --> 27:14.880]  pulling he knows full well what he's doing and it's sick they get off on this
[27:14.880 --> 27:22.240]  idea of being the selfless caring good people and Angelina Jolie now I'm not
[27:22.240 --> 27:25.920]  calling for George Clooney's arrest because he's not officially an envoy of
[27:25.920 --> 27:30.400]  the UN he doesn't officially go stand at the dock when they're you know convicting
[27:30.400 --> 27:34.400]  somebody in a kangaroo court calling them the bad man but the UN doing you
[27:34.400 --> 27:39.200]  know a hundred to one murder is the good guy she's an actual agent of this
[27:39.200 --> 27:44.280]  going to Tunisia for months agitating for war with Libya and destroying their
[27:44.280 --> 27:48.800]  infrastructure she goes and agitates for an invasion of Syria she goes and
[27:48.800 --> 27:53.080]  agitates for a war against Iran she goes and agitates for an invasion of
[27:53.080 --> 27:59.120]  Uganda to back up the government sweeping the people she is an agent of this
[27:59.120 --> 28:05.360]  Clooney's got his free speech and oh let's you know let your humanitarian
[28:05.360 --> 28:12.400]  mission come into Sudan you saw the humanitarian mission of Libya right they
[28:12.400 --> 28:16.320]  said well bombing is kinetic action it's not war and yeah we're bombing
[28:16.320 --> 28:20.760]  apartment buildings and in all of this but you know what Gaddafi might have
[28:20.760 --> 28:24.680]  roughed up some protesters you mean protesters with bazookas and rocket
[28:24.680 --> 28:30.200]  launchers RPGs and aircraft and tanks you mean you mean those guys that were
[28:30.200 --> 28:35.240]  lining people up on the highway if they weren't part of the Al Qaeda well hobby
[28:35.240 --> 28:40.240]  groups and shooting them and on video hacking families up with machetes you
[28:40.240 --> 28:45.960]  mean those guys this was already going on in the east of Libya while Joe Lee was
[28:45.960 --> 28:50.080]  running around praising these people saying it was wonderful again the west
[28:50.080 --> 28:56.840]  goes in funds a uprising calls it peaceful and then bombs the country now
[28:56.840 --> 29:02.040]  I've got to say humanitarian intervention in Sudan is a lot more reasonable
[29:02.040 --> 29:06.400]  than it would be in Libya or Uganda where Uganda the our government in the
[29:06.400 --> 29:10.760]  west is backing the dictator who's killed millions of people in 26 years on
[29:10.760 --> 29:16.600]  record there it's purely naked aggression and excuse to grab oil and
[29:16.600 --> 29:22.520]  other minerals in the case of Sudan the Muslims are the aggressors they are
[29:22.520 --> 29:28.200]  pushing the Christians back there is genocide but you better believe that if
[29:28.200 --> 29:31.880]  the US goes in there it's for the resources and the people are ended up
[29:31.880 --> 29:36.160]  even being worse off in fact from what I've seen the past the West will go in
[29:36.160 --> 29:40.280]  take over and then put in a new Muslim leader like Odinga in Kenya and they'll
[29:40.280 --> 29:44.120]  start killing Christians at a hundred times the rate that's my point you can't
[29:44.120 --> 29:47.360]  get good out of this new world order they've always got an excuse of why
[29:47.360 --> 29:52.400]  they're doing something but it never ends up we're on the March the empires on

[34:42.960 --> 34:48.760]  that's not really true the United States became wealthy because of its
[34:48.760 --> 34:54.360]  inventiveness and because of its wealth and had over 10% growth rates for the
[34:54.360 --> 35:00.760]  first 100 plus years of its expansion and some of that was exploitive but the
[35:00.760 --> 35:04.240]  Indians the natives were killing each other they would come and say help me
[35:04.240 --> 35:08.160]  go knock out the other tribe humans are humans they were acting the exact same
[35:08.160 --> 35:12.360]  way it was just that the Europeans had more advanced technologies and you'd
[35:12.360 --> 35:16.280]  have the French teamed up with one tribe or tribes in the British teamed up
[35:16.280 --> 35:19.600]  with another group and the Spanish teamed up with another it was an all-out
[35:19.600 --> 35:23.080]  fight and the Indians totally got it because they weren't all just living
[35:23.080 --> 35:27.920]  in peace they were constantly fighting over who had control of what area they
[35:27.920 --> 35:34.640]  just didn't put it down in deeds on paper they would so so a lot of this has
[35:34.640 --> 35:40.640]  been romanticized when in reality it was something else my point is we pay for
[35:40.640 --> 35:45.760]  the Empire and we lose a lot more supporting the Empire than we actually
[35:45.760 --> 35:50.200]  gained from it and that idea that we're getting ahead because of the New World
[35:50.200 --> 35:58.520]  Order this entire New World Order system is going after our freedoms as well the
[35:58.520 --> 36:03.480]  globalists see all humans the same to be exploited to be dumbed down to be
[36:03.480 --> 36:06.800]  controlled to be killed if they can get away with it if you don't have anything
[36:06.800 --> 36:12.600]  that offers something up to them it's all about raw pure power and the
[36:12.600 --> 36:17.760]  globalist see that as the greatest attribute that they are ruthless and
[36:17.760 --> 36:22.040]  they see those of us that aren't as weak alright so let me go through a
[36:22.040 --> 36:29.240]  smattering of other important news that ties into this look at this report
[36:29.240 --> 36:38.760]  Greece on the breadline HIV and malaria make a comeback and this is from the
[36:38.760 --> 36:44.560]  London Guardian the savage cuts to Greece's health services budget well
[36:44.560 --> 36:48.040]  once you get social as health care all you got to the government have led to
[36:48.040 --> 36:53.940]  sharp rise in HIV AIDS and malaria in the beleaguered nation said a leading
[36:53.940 --> 36:58.460]  aid organization yesterday the incidence of AIDS among
[36:58.460 --> 37:03.720]  intervening drug users in central Athens soared by 1,250% in the first 10
[37:03.720 --> 37:08.040]  months 2011 compared with the same period the previous year according to the
[37:08.040 --> 37:13.160]  head and it goes through the group also they report that malaria is becoming
[37:13.160 --> 37:19.120]  epidemic in the south for the first time since the rule of the kernels which
[37:19.120 --> 37:26.440]  ended the 1970s and it just goes on folks they are being forced to dump their
[37:26.440 --> 37:32.080]  children on the street and government orphanages are running out of food their
[37:32.080 --> 37:37.320]  power outages now and you're like wow that's terrible well the globalists
[37:37.320 --> 37:42.240]  want to have their society fall apart because then confidence dries up
[37:42.240 --> 37:47.240]  tourism dries up things will completely fall apart and in the next five years or
[37:47.240 --> 37:51.480]  so the globalists can go in and buy up everything for pennies on the dollar and
[37:51.480 --> 37:55.920]  then they'll have certain economic zones that they turn back on but only those
[37:55.920 --> 38:01.560]  zones everything else will be in squalor in a high security type system and
[38:01.560 --> 38:04.160]  that's why you're going into the checkpoint society because the elites
[38:04.160 --> 38:08.600]  want to be safe within their system and they want to make you poor as a tool of
[38:08.600 --> 38:13.440]  control but also really corrupt elites have written about this they enjoy it's
[38:13.440 --> 38:18.800]  called feudalism it's a system of poverty for control seeing you poor that
[38:18.800 --> 38:25.440]  makes their caviar and mistresses and kids they rape and kill for fine that
[38:25.440 --> 38:31.400]  makes it that much more enjoyable you see they don't like seeing people do
[38:31.400 --> 38:35.880]  well you've all run into people out there that hate it when somebody's doing
[38:35.880 --> 38:38.880]  well instead of like oh I'm glad you're doing well or wow you're really
[38:38.880 --> 38:44.200]  beautiful I admire that or you're really talented I admire that there are a lot
[38:44.200 --> 38:49.360]  of people out there who hate it well that's the globalist the globalist at
[38:49.360 --> 38:55.400]  their core hate other people's success they hate beauty they hate independence
[38:55.400 --> 38:59.520]  they hate freedom they want you to be so poor that you've got to grovel to them
[38:59.520 --> 39:03.560]  and they write about this every year at Bilderberg we get from Tucker and others
[39:03.560 --> 39:08.880]  who have sources inside and I have some sources that are in the second national
[39:08.880 --> 39:11.840]  on a Bilderberg I'll just leave it at that that I've developed the first thing
[39:11.840 --> 39:15.840]  they say is look at those protesters out there we've got a shut down the
[39:15.840 --> 39:20.240]  economy where they don't even have money to eat their house or have a car or be
[39:20.240 --> 39:25.800]  here we're hiding out in the mountains of Switzerland and there's 800 protesters
[39:25.800 --> 39:29.560]  out there with members of the Swiss government demanding to be let in here
[39:29.560 --> 39:34.520]  what is the problem I want the economy shut down and I want it shut down now
[39:34.520 --> 39:39.160]  and then they cut to debates and say well listen your excellency if we cut
[39:39.160 --> 39:42.920]  off the resources too quickly they're gonna riot against us and overthrow us
[39:42.920 --> 39:48.000]  so we've got to do it slowly and and then later I'll be told something by
[39:48.000 --> 39:53.280]  Tucker or my other sources and like two years later I'll see him at Davos say
[39:53.280 --> 39:58.400]  this thing on the stage that I was told word for word by name who said what two
[39:58.400 --> 40:03.000]  years before so a lot of times they'll I mean Tucker's like they're gonna have
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.720]  the fall of the Berlin Wall in one year they've decided with the Soviets to do
[40:06.720 --> 40:10.960]  it it's to make everybody think communism's dead but in a way it's true
[40:10.960 --> 40:16.160]  because they can't hold their system together so it was both boom everybody
[40:16.160 --> 40:22.400]  laughed at him happen he's like they'll be firing Margaret Thatcher it's scary
[40:22.400 --> 40:25.040]  when you can't do a gruff old man voice and you do it you find out it's your own
[40:25.040 --> 40:31.360]  voice but he's like Margaret Thatcher will be out within six months they're
[40:31.360 --> 40:36.160]  done with her everybody's like oh yeah right boom she's gone George Bush will
[40:36.160 --> 40:39.720]  within the next two months endorse carbon taxes he'd been totally against it
[40:39.720 --> 40:47.760]  boom it happened I mean just gas prices will go from $45 a barrel to about 150
[40:47.760 --> 40:52.680]  in the next year everybody's like that's ridiculous boom happened then Bilderberg's
[40:52.680 --> 40:56.680]  now concerned 2008 said on my show I was up at Bilderberg covering it in
[40:56.680 --> 41:01.680]  Virginia he's like well my source told me that they're you know they're a little
[41:01.680 --> 41:06.200]  worried people on the edge of the vault so they will now lower it to below 60 boom
[41:06.200 --> 41:12.240]  starts I mean it's just like these people really are running things that's
[41:12.240 --> 41:17.360]  the incredible proof of it they're steering it to a great degree they want
[41:17.360 --> 41:22.200]  global government so that they can fully control society and if you have no
[41:22.200 --> 41:26.440]  privacy you have no freedom if they have total transparency into your life
[41:26.440 --> 41:29.720]  and know what you're doing they can predict what you're gonna do next and
[41:29.720 --> 41:34.240]  totally control you so government and the elites are all secret that's the new
[41:34.240 --> 41:38.160]  world order and exempt from their own laws they pass that are unconstitutional
[41:38.160 --> 41:42.640]  and tyrannical and then you live under total transparency with no privacy and
[41:42.640 --> 41:48.360]  there's all these laws piled on you that's the essence of slavery and we're
[41:48.360 --> 41:52.640]  sold that it's liberty we're sold that it's freedom we're sold that it's this
[41:52.640 --> 41:59.360]  great thing and it's not so that's what I'm trying to get out here and we told
[41:59.360 --> 42:02.480]  you austerity was coming three and a half years ago on the Obama deception I
[42:02.480 --> 42:08.320]  told you 12 years ago that they would use the derivatives as a weapon to infect
[42:08.320 --> 42:12.800]  all the treasuries and all the other investments they would hold people hostage
[42:12.800 --> 42:18.800]  and then say sign on to the bankers debt and make us the bosses or we'll go into
[42:18.800 --> 42:24.600]  total cardiac arrest and then instead you just go into a slow decline a full
[42:24.600 --> 42:28.480]  cardiac arrest of the economy would actually cause a real change probably
[42:28.480 --> 42:32.200]  but they want to wait till they've got everything lined up before they do that
[42:32.200 --> 42:37.400]  so we do it in steps first it's gradual then it's kind of steps downward and
[42:37.400 --> 42:40.600]  then they do plan some plunging but not yet they've got to get everything in
[42:40.600 --> 42:44.360]  order first because a big plunge too early would actually expose them I mean
[42:44.360 --> 42:50.520]  think about how ridiculous it is that the very six megabanks that have
[42:50.520 --> 42:55.000]  engineered the fraud and put their politicians in then sign Greece in
[42:55.000 --> 43:02.440]  Ireland and Iceland and United States and Europe Germany France England on to
[43:02.440 --> 43:09.800]  their debt well yes 92% in Iceland and 91% in Greece and 89% in this country or
[43:09.800 --> 43:14.400]  that is derivatives that the country signed on to to the very bankers who
[43:14.400 --> 43:18.200]  are now announcing themselves the bosses and putting their presidents and
[43:18.200 --> 43:23.400]  prime ministers in that's not very sophisticated that's pretty clear it's
[43:23.400 --> 43:29.600]  being conquered by financial fraud and they cut the police they cut the fire
[43:29.600 --> 43:33.680]  they cut the teachers they cut the health care they cut everything and tell
[43:33.680 --> 43:38.720]  you well you deserve this because you were on welfare when they made you go
[43:38.720 --> 43:44.040]  under socialist health care in Greece and other places Paul Watson's over in
[43:44.040 --> 43:53.160]  England he has had a chest cold for a month and I would call him he go no I'm
[43:53.160 --> 43:58.120]  still really sick Alex it's terrible and he goes I'm still fighting to get in
[43:58.120 --> 44:03.480]  to see the government doctor and I said but I read England's got private
[44:03.480 --> 44:07.240]  doctors and he and of course I knew the answer I don't know why I said that and
[44:07.240 --> 44:10.680]  he goes yes Alex but you've got to go to the government first and then they've
[44:10.680 --> 44:17.200]  got to allow you and they refer you to a private practitioner and he was
[44:17.200 --> 44:22.000]  starting to really get concerned he was you know laying out in the sun and the
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.000]  cold weather trying to get you know vitamin a and stuff he was taking all
[44:26.000 --> 44:30.600]  vitamins minerals all this stuff is missing really bad chest colds going
[44:30.600 --> 44:33.720]  around the world as you know it's all these drug resistant bacteria and
[44:33.720 --> 44:38.200]  mutated viruses because of antibiotics and things and he finally got in to see
[44:38.200 --> 44:42.600]  the government health care people and I've watched the House of Lords debates
[44:42.600 --> 44:48.280]  many times it's quite a spectacle and I mean I remember Tony Blair and they're
[44:48.280 --> 44:52.280]  over and over again they'd go they'd go Prime Minister is it not true that
[44:52.280 --> 44:57.000]  people on average are waiting 18 months for brain surgeries that are close to
[44:57.000 --> 45:02.840]  100% operable that means they can fix it if you have the surgery within three
[45:02.840 --> 45:08.280]  months but can almost completely fatal after one year and he stands up yes it's
[45:08.280 --> 45:14.200]  true we're working on that I mean this is what we want here and then big bank
[45:14.200 --> 45:18.600]  owned insurance company owned health care providers wrote the health care bill
[45:18.600 --> 45:23.080]  and then acted like you know the greedy HMOs didn't want it when they wrote it
[45:23.080 --> 45:27.920]  and now they've changed their Supreme Court pleadings show that Anthony
[45:27.920 --> 45:32.040]  Scalia they're saying that's in the news today may vote and say the government
[45:32.040 --> 45:37.240]  can make you buy a product as if we need any debate about whether that's the
[45:37.240 --> 45:41.480]  constitutional or not it's unconstitutional and it's part of this
[45:41.480 --> 45:46.400]  nanny state well we make you get car insurance you didn't used to used to
[45:46.400 --> 45:50.560]  run somebody over you got arrested for reckless driving or they'd come take your
[45:50.560 --> 45:54.000]  house or they'd throw you in jail
[45:55.240 --> 45:59.600]  yeah there it is national health service waiting time increases may cost
[45:59.600 --> 46:06.200]  lives doctors warn may may cost lives it's already costing lives that too have
[46:06.200 --> 46:10.200]  a one-in-a-one guardian that's the trap of socialist health care ladies and
[46:10.200 --> 46:14.680]  gentlemen everyone's always been able to get health care in this country I mean
[46:14.680 --> 46:20.600]  I've had an injury before gone to the hospital on the weekend I've got insurance
[46:20.600 --> 46:25.360]  I got money in my wallet I got credit cards I sat at the back of the line
[46:25.360 --> 46:30.160]  with a finger dangling by a piece of skin as the illegal aliens on record
[46:30.160 --> 46:35.240]  were just waved in not even a debate they get instant coverage I had a crew
[46:35.240 --> 46:39.520]  member who had a big surgery had to have because of a pre-existing condition he
[46:39.520 --> 46:44.440]  couldn't get been thrown off insurance I said don't worry they're supposed to
[46:44.440 --> 46:47.920]  give you 30% charity care they don't want to tell you about this only the
[46:47.920 --> 46:52.000]  illegals are taught how to access it he went got the whole thing paid for like a
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.920]  $40,000 surgery couldn't believe it I'm like listen
[46:54.920 --> 47:02.360]  medicine is supposed to be taking care of people again the but now under the
[47:02.360 --> 47:05.800]  health care rules under Obama they're allowing hospitals to get rid of those
[47:05.800 --> 47:10.800]  mandates that have always just been there as part of your Hippocratic oath so
[47:10.800 --> 47:15.280]  see no one gets turned away from health care unless you're ignorant and they
[47:15.280 --> 47:20.640]  don't teach American citizens how to access all of this so now all of that's
[47:20.640 --> 47:32.120]  going to be gone look at Greece once they get you once they get you addicted to
[47:32.120 --> 47:37.880]  this once they get you to where you don't have any other choice they say
[47:37.880 --> 47:40.600]  yeah you get your health care if you've had all your vaccines yeah you get your
[47:40.600 --> 47:45.040]  health care if you take this anti-racism drug you're not making you you know do
[47:45.040 --> 47:49.600]  that they're saying that they're pushing people do that I mean it's it's it's a
[47:49.600 --> 47:58.440]  total nightmare nanny state controlling every facet of your life and they
[47:58.440 --> 48:03.800]  always sell their tyranny taking private property taking your guns banning
[48:03.800 --> 48:09.400]  sports banning tag banning drawing a gun in art class in the name of keeping
[48:09.400 --> 48:13.040]  everybody safe invading Africa all we got to keep somebody safe we got a bomb
[48:13.040 --> 48:18.360]  Libya because we love them they always shell it with we come in peace we're
[48:18.360 --> 48:23.760]  friends it's total camouflage it's a total front George Clooney is a loving
[48:23.760 --> 48:27.880]  liberal who's just an idiot means well total front it's a raving dangerous
[48:27.880 --> 48:37.000]  criminal Angelina Jolie all of them they know exactly what they're doing and it's
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.800]  time to stop being naive and realize these aren't idiots they're in charge
[48:41.800 --> 48:50.400]  they've been given power because they play ball with the new world order it's
[48:50.400 --> 48:56.760]  that simple and so it's going to take doing real research folks to be informed
[48:56.760 --> 49:02.280]  I mean look at this there's a big article saying Bernanke's been caught
[49:02.280 --> 49:07.960]  lying about inflation in the US in Bloomberg well no one buys that inflation
[49:07.960 --> 49:11.680]  is low everybody knows inflation's up even though they've depressed the
[49:11.680 --> 49:20.720]  economy still there's inflation an inflationary depression that's supposed
[49:20.720 --> 49:24.960]  to be impossible in the economic Keynesian system but it's not because we live in a
[49:24.960 --> 49:33.520]  rigged economy it's the double super whammy here's another one
[49:34.240 --> 49:41.320]  Obama shifts health care defense again I mentioned that article to you but I
[49:41.320 --> 49:47.240]  have another article here dealing with David Cameron and I'm gonna cover that
[49:47.240 --> 49:49.960]  after I get to some calls when we come back in the next segment because I want
[49:49.960 --> 49:55.480]  to get to your calls Starstruck David Cameron's embarrassing fawning over

[50:09.480 --> 50:13.240]  wouldn't even meet with the Republican leadership he wouldn't even meet with a
[50:13.240 --> 50:18.040]  Republican Congress and he badmouthed them in speeches with Obama but guess
[50:18.040 --> 50:22.600]  where he really spent his time while he was here financial Times reports
[50:22.600 --> 50:29.680]  fawning over the head of Goldman Sachs Lloyd Blank fine well yeah he came to

[54:12.800 --> 54:17.280]  you know the kind of news i want to cover is stuff like a gentleman who in the
[54:17.280 --> 54:23.200]  1970s went up reportedly 30 plus miles in a balloon of some type
[54:23.200 --> 54:27.280]  and they say really holds the record for skydiving
[54:27.280 --> 54:30.560]  i'd like to try to get that guy on i mean that is really neat that's the kind of
[54:30.560 --> 54:34.160]  news i'm really into but we've got to deal with these globalists who are
[54:34.160 --> 54:37.360]  trying to destroy our planet
[54:37.920 --> 54:42.560]  and they're not trying they're sure sure doing a good job without trying
[54:42.560 --> 54:47.840]  instead of you know focusing on all this negative stuff i would rather
[54:47.840 --> 54:53.600]  focus on interesting things like record-seeking skydiver makes 13 mile
[54:53.600 --> 54:58.640]  test jump skydiving daredevil felix
[54:59.440 --> 55:04.640]  how do you pronounce that bomb gardener is more than halfway towards his goal
[55:04.640 --> 55:08.000]  of setting a world record for the highest jump
[55:08.000 --> 55:13.280]  and it says that uh he jumped from 71,581 feet looks like he's in space
[55:13.280 --> 55:19.120]  but he's now he's in a spacesuit they're saying the record is 19.5 miles
[55:19.120 --> 55:24.480]  but they're arguing that others may have actually done it from higher
[55:24.480 --> 55:28.640]  just not properly documented it talk about adventurous
[55:28.640 --> 55:33.120]  then you got the woman who reportedly committed suicide with the chainsaw
[55:33.120 --> 55:36.160]  maybe that's like an ark inside maybe somebody did it and they
[55:36.160 --> 55:39.840]  made her leave a note before they did it who knows i mean there's just so much
[55:39.840 --> 55:43.520]  crazy stuff going on uh right now let's start going to your
[55:43.520 --> 55:46.160]  phone calls for the next 30 40 minutes for uh congressman
[55:46.160 --> 55:50.560]  joins us um brandon in canada you're on the air welcome
[55:50.560 --> 55:54.160]  hey good morning alex hi um yeah going back to this cony
[55:54.160 --> 55:58.400]  2012 thing i just had an idea what if someone made a film
[55:58.400 --> 56:04.160]  in the same style but like have it like push chainy 2012 or something like
[56:04.160 --> 56:06.720]  that you know i actually thought of that i actually
[56:06.720 --> 56:10.240]  thought of that and and that would really get people's attention
[56:10.240 --> 56:15.280]  bush chaney 2012 and then it would connect people's mind to hey
[56:15.280 --> 56:18.480]  here's the real war crimes here's what they did or
[56:18.480 --> 56:23.680]  or uh clinton clinton 2012 because the clinton's did a
[56:23.680 --> 56:26.880]  bunch of mass murder in the 90s as well absolutely
[56:26.880 --> 56:30.240]  yeah no no that's a great idea and uh you know you could have like a little boy
[56:30.240 --> 56:34.640]  looking at pictures of bush and chaney and things this is a bad man
[56:34.640 --> 56:38.000]  well i've said that's what propaganda has come down to now is just like there's
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.360]  the bad man getting but again i wouldn't have just focused on this
[56:41.360 --> 56:45.760]  charity the last week off and on and it was just about the charity
[56:45.760 --> 56:49.360]  you know being uh a a scam from my research
[56:49.360 --> 56:55.280]  and in my view i've been focused on this because it is the opening salvo for a
[56:55.280 --> 56:58.000]  bunch of pr from the un calling for invasions
[56:58.000 --> 57:02.800]  humanitarianly george cloney getting arrested uh angeline and joe lee at the
[57:02.800 --> 57:06.080]  un pushing for it i mean i told folks watch this is
[57:06.080 --> 57:10.160]  gonna launch a big pr drive and it's just begun i mean it's
[57:10.160 --> 57:14.720]  everywhere now it's sin troops to africa we demand it
[57:14.720 --> 57:17.520]  look another thing too alexa i was thinking about you being the tip of the
[57:17.520 --> 57:21.040]  spear and your network i mean like you know guys like
[57:21.040 --> 57:24.640]  george norie jesse venturi and jesse ventura all these guys
[57:24.640 --> 57:28.880]  i mean uh what if you created a forum where all you
[57:28.880 --> 57:33.920]  men and women got together where you couldn't be like not listen to you know
[57:33.920 --> 57:39.120]  undeniably a voice well you know people like george norie and
[57:39.120 --> 57:42.720]  and jesse ventura and ron paul and others they're all real independent
[57:42.720 --> 57:46.240]  and they understand that a lot of times when people just try to get organized
[57:46.240 --> 57:51.280]  have like a conference or something uh everybody feels really important and
[57:51.280 --> 57:54.880]  there's resolutions passed and then people say okay we're gonna move
[57:54.880 --> 57:58.640]  forward in this way and nothing really comes out of it
[57:58.640 --> 58:01.920]  what's better is just for all of us to attack in different directions
[58:01.920 --> 58:05.120]  but in the same directions as well against tyranny
[58:05.120 --> 58:08.640]  and the general fight is happening and ongoing right now
[58:08.640 --> 58:12.720]  i mean notice how the globalists now are going out and launching pr to attack
[58:12.720 --> 58:16.640]  things but making it look like it's coming from the grass roots see
[58:16.640 --> 58:21.120]  the system's already lost credibility so they're gonna now try to pose as oh
[58:21.120 --> 58:25.520]  the grass roots wants war oh the peace groups wanted towards cloney wants it
[58:25.520 --> 58:29.120]  well then that's but the white house documents are there with cement the
[58:29.120 --> 58:32.240]  powers and others shang three years ago
[58:32.240 --> 58:35.920]  this would be their model to launch all the new wars
[58:35.920 --> 58:43.360]  that's what they've done have the left call for it
[58:43.360 --> 58:50.800]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[58:50.800 --> 58:54.160]  a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research
[58:54.160 --> 58:58.000]  into why even if i had a pretty good size meal that i was still starving
[58:58.000 --> 59:02.240]  and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we
[59:02.240 --> 59:05.440]  grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized
[59:05.440 --> 59:09.680]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[59:09.680 --> 59:14.000]  minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves
[59:14.000 --> 59:17.920]  fight off cancer and be healthy i then searched out the best
[59:17.920 --> 59:22.240]  vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered young jeviti the

[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:53.360]  news for us uh then we're going to have a
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:56.800]  Ugandan woman on whose one video has been watched more than three million
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.400]  times exposing that cony 2012 and this whole call for an
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.160]  invasion over there is not what the population has been wanting
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.760]  there have been riots and stonings and people doing all sorts of stuff over
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:11.680]  there when they see the film because it's just complete bull
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.200]  watching trendies hop around and act like they're saviors
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:20.080]  calling for invasion forces so that's all coming up
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.840]  also we've got a lot of economic news on the inflation front
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:27.120]  and on the government health care front and the iran front but right now
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:32.800]  let's go to your phone calls brice in missouri you're on the year welcome
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:36.960]  thanks alex for taking my call i really appreciate what you folks are doing
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:42.400]  and we're all in this info war together and stuff like that
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:47.040]  although i can get discouraged because i put out a movie about a month ago
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:50.480]  i won't name names because i respect your show and everything like that
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.840]  but but no traction got on it and then you got this globalist
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:58.000]  funded movie uh that comes out and millions and millions of people see
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.760]  it and and i just pray and ask god to
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:05.440]  to what's going on here what's wrong with this picture uh
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:09.040]  what's your take on that i mean specifically what's wrong with what
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:14.240]  picture well the the the same the same idea is we're
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.400]  all in this together fighting the info war so you put out a movie on youtube
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:22.720]  and you don't get as much traction as let's say you know kony 2012 or
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:27.200]  or whatever what i mean what can we do to kind of just
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:31.680]  up the ante up the up the uh i guess the hits on the video or
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:35.840]  how can how can i get my message across all right
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:40.080]  look i appreciate your call um
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:44.240]  let's just take youtube alone as one venue we reach people through
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:49.040]  conservatively conservatively now because i've gone back and actually
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:54.320]  added it up the last three years or so we've had about 500 million views
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:58.000]  conservatively one way or another on youtube
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.600]  500 million something like kony that has a big
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:07.520]  foundations behind it and george w bush and bill gates
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.640]  and zebigny brzezinski and the national security council
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:15.200]  and the white house and the carter center and the open society foundation
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:18.480]  and the international coalition for responsibility to
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:22.080]  protect all these groups
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:29.120]  they launch something and push it for a year and then release it and then have
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:34.080]  thousands of newspapers and hundreds of tv systems under their control
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:38.800]  promote it and all it gets is i don't know all versions together maybe over
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.680]  100 million views
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:46.320]  and then there are tens of thousands of videos with
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:50.080]  hundreds of thousands hundreds of videos with over a million views
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:54.640]  if you put all my kony videos i did together probably three million views
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:57.200]  last week
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:02.560]  but then i saw hundreds and hundreds of other people put out videos and then
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.520]  people from you gone to come out and respond to my videos and their videos
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.200]  got hundreds of thousands and millions and you name it and so you added
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:12.640]  together we they had to shut down comments on the
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:16.080]  video they had to back off they're having to respond now
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:19.520]  and then mainstream media even picked it up and said yeah this is a
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:24.800]  this is a distortion so i think we absolutely kicked their butt
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:28.720]  i mean they had to fake a grassroots campaign just to get the viral spread
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:32.320]  they did get and so i don't know how people always
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.600]  take everything as a loss when it's a win
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:40.240]  i mean we've had a big win on this and now they got cloney getting arrested
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:43.520]  now they got angelina jolly at the court doing stunts they they're
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:47.600]  doing their big rollout for new wars calling it liberal war apiece
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.840]  and we're countering it and you know it took six months for obama to go
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.600]  negative in the polls when he had a 90 percent approval rating or higher
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:00.800]  i mean did these guys are wearing out quick now
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.320]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.000]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.600]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.240]  silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:17.520]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:20.400]  again so our friends at solutions from science
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:23.520]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds

[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:36.080]  in the last week and a half on the fact that impeachment proceedings have begun
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:42.320]  in the house and senate via the treason of obama announcing our militaries under
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:46.000]  you in command and now of course the marines aren't allowed to have their
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.640]  guns around the secretary of defense because they can't be trusted

[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:11.280]  want to mention this little article by paul
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:16.560]  joseph watson and this story has been picked up
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:20.640]  by the drudge report drudge report dot com i should add they're on the right hand side
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:24.400]  before i get to this also uh that was breaking here yesterday
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.240]  i had been told about a week ago by liberty guard folks i talked to that
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:32.000]  they were planning to file suit and so i said well please come on when you file
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.080]  suit and so i i guess bob bar announced yesterday that he
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:39.440]  liberty guard was filing suit against the tsa and that got picked up
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:43.120]  by the wall street journal market watch and some other outfits and they've
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.480]  confirmed that matt drudge and alex jones are
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:49.840]  in government documents they've admitted that the
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:56.320]  the total sexual assault group the tsa or the toilet safety administration as
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:00.560]  south park calls them but i like total sexual assault that's what it is
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.560]  uh has our names and websites in a database
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:08.800]  when they did that national stand down to the scanners on national opt out day
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:11.760]  you know to say no to the scanners and so for a year and a half they've been
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:15.360]  trying to get those documents the government has admitted that indeed
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:19.040]  those names are involved in secret communication
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:24.320]  uh matt drudge alex jones you name it but they will not release the nine pages
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:29.680]  they released some of it but it's redacted so bob bar has filed suit on them
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:33.040]  i want to find out what they're saying about me
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.560]  i mean i'm really honored to be on the white house enemies list
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:39.920]  and i'm really honored to be on the tsa enemies list but i want to know what
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.040]  they're saying about me i mean i love it that i'm in
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:46.480]  the wiki leaks with strat for attacking me calling me crazy
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:49.680]  because i didn't believe that whole bin laden fairy tale but then they go on to
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.680]  say they don't believe he was thrown in the ocean
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:55.360]  well what you're supposed to just believe whatever obama tells you i
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:11:00.000]  thought i'm a crazy man i mean i like it when i know we're getting under their
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.240]  skin last year when i exposed because it was in
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:05.600]  their own documents they want to shut down power plants to double profits for
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.720]  g and others because they're allowed to stay open
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.160]  i was excited when the white house spokesman
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.000]  j carney came out and said we were crazy i mean that is
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.640]  that is exciting to really know you're having an effect
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:23.680]  you know why folks always say please just give me your john handcock
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.280]  you know when you're at the bank taking out a loan or when you sign a credit
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:30.560]  card receipt or at a hotel give me your john handcock please that was kind of
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.880]  an old saying back when folks knew us history
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:36.000]  john handcock everybody signing that declaration of independence
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  was signing a warrant that they would be arrested killed attacked if they didn't
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.600]  win against an empire who'd never been defeated
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:47.200]  and some of the signatures are pretty small on there and john handcock went
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:51.520]  bam baby and they said why'd you sign it so big and he said i want to be on the
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:55.440]  list and at the top of every list exactly if you're
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:58.720]  going to go into a fight you better go into it 110
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:01.920]  percent because i'm doing the best i can i love

[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:29.040]  it's selfishness and explain that to people selfishness

[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:12.240]  nation on the side they got the un signs up in front of
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:15.680]  national forest saying hey that we own the property now it's funny they even
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:19.200]  put up un ngos at the hike and bike trails and i'm
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.280]  so conditioned now i'd left my iphone you know
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:25.600]  hidden in the trunk of my car i was going on a hike
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:28.480]  and i didn't even go back and get it because it was on down the path about a
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.160]  quarter mile i've been conditioned to just accept
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:36.080]  it and i i did see a blurb where there's un designations
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:42.400]  under the unidire regulation on ammo uh for now about two years
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:49.120]  they denominate a postal service on international shipments according to
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:52.720]  s dr's which is that global cash was uh currency
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:58.160]  and you're right we're already in this thing and we're just taking it and now
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:03.120]  i heard this six months ago and didn't believe it till i saw it new ammo
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:07.040]  uh is being shipped out internationally i guess if it's for the military
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:10.880]  and they're micro etching some of the bullets and i didn't believe that
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:16.080]  they're just doing whatever they want they're doing whatever they want john
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:20.320]  and go to a toy store go to a toy store and look at the toy army soldiers and
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:23.760]  see something that says us army fighting men or us army soldiers
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.120]  it's not there it's all little peacekeepers now i have made that point
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:30.480]  for 10 years in fact will you run back to tim frugia because they cleaned out the
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:34.320]  warehouse and there were all the props things i bought over
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:37.360]  15 years have just continually gotten put into
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:42.480]  you know different offices and there was a big pile of toys i'd seen in stores
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:46.880]  where it was all un soldier this un soldier that global peace force
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:51.040]  and i said hey uh give me that a few weeks ago and i don't know
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:54.880]  where they just ask him give me the un toys just just folks run get them to
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:58.960]  bring me the un toys listen i've been in stores and you can't
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:02.560]  find because i've got three children you cannot find
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:08.560]  tanks or airplanes or army men that don't say you in and the cartoons are
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.800]  all the same but the propaganda has gone on a
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.600]  long time i let my children watch the old cheesy
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:16.720]  60s godzilla movies when they're really good and do good at their home school
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:19.760]  like once a month because you know it's guys in a gorilla suit
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:23.280]  or a dinosaur suit you know like last night we watched half of
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:29.520]  king kong versus godzilla totally cheesy great comedy for adults a guy and
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:33.120]  looks like a hundred dollar monkey suit fighting with a guy in a hundred dollar

[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:34.560]  evil force but it's propaganda ads of a force for good
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:39.440]  a force to fight evil and tyranny everywhere
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:43.760]  that's the marines and it's not even a good voiceover guy i was watching this

[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:54.080]  like a force for good a force globally for freedom
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:59.680]  we run towards the threat but it wasn't even like a cool voice like
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:04.080]  battling tyranny worldwide doing what it takes to defend the republic it was
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:08.400]  like i'm big i'm bad

[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:21.520]  watching on prism planet dot tv and you're listening to radio all you got
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:25.280]  to do is just pull into a toy store and walk into the military toy section
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:30.560]  and it's all global government these are the good guys right here
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:34.240]  ones with a really hateful looks that's the that's the tough guys
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:37.440]  over there radio listeners are like what are you talking about well anybody
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:41.440]  with children seen it for the last decade you can't find nothing but you and
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:45.280]  police toys even the playmobil things it's like
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:52.160]  oh checkpoint police oh checkpoint army oh tsa police it actually shows the
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:56.080]  playmobil groping people uh so this is just the full conditioning
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:59.600]  they have microwave oven little deals oh put the toy in there
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:03.200]  let's go to dentis in iowa dentists you're on the air welcome
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:06.960]  hey it's a pleasure to talk to you alex you do a hell of a job buddy
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:12.560]  well i tried well you try very good hey i wonder wondering for your listeners
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:15.680]  and i want to ask you if you also know about this
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:19.040]  uh chuckie cheese schumer and scott brown
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:25.520]  have been putting legislation out there they want to bring in 11 000 more e3 visa
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:31.040]  workers in this country when so many americans are out of work now
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:36.080]  and then by the time you add into the visas for all their spouses and children
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:39.520]  this is a big deal in my mind have you heard about it and i just wanted to
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.280]  let your listeners know about it in case they haven't heard about it yeah that's
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:46.800]  the highly skilled people right no no this is
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:50.400]  that's the low skill requirements on this one
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:54.480]  is that they have two years of minimal work experience in a field you know i've
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:57.440]  seen that i'd seen that they want the unskilled visas which are pointless and
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.720]  they want more high skilled ones all i know is
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:03.920]  that the high skilled people come here learn their trade and then are sent back
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:07.840]  by the globalists to set up factories overseas and then there's tax incentives
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:11.600]  to leave the united states but yeah i did see a blurb a
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:14.640]  few weeks ago that they want more unskilled visas which are just
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:17.760]  pointless so that's a good point i mean look none of
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:20.800]  these other countries allow this type of exploitation
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:24.480]  globalism has not been good for our country and i'm glad you mentioned that
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.200]  i can i get confused all the visa terms and
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:30.640]  names but uh i need to look into that more
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:35.280]  another short funny thing for you alex i'm a registered independent
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:38.240]  i have gotten like five times now in the mail this
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:42.880]  crap from a obama campaign with this pretty little black and white picture
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:47.040]  in it want me to donate i pull the envelope out
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:51.920]  may even on the envelope it says you can save our campaign money if you place a
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:56.480]  stamp on it it is supposed to be paid but you can save us money if you put your
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:59.840]  own stamp on it i don't put a stamp on it
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:04.160]  i drop a washer in the envelope i seal it and i mail it back to him
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:08.160]  haha just a little just a little humor there
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:11.200]  no no you could put like you could put like a hundred washers
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:15.040]  or like or like in a small child's bowling ball and put it inside the
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:18.080]  envelope and then just it has the postage just tape it
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:21.120]  with the postage sticking out and mail in the bowling ball
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:24.800]  funny thing is is i keep getting them back again i mean the same thing in the
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:26.720]  mail i mean you would think they would stop
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:30.240]  the aid let's don't say it's all robotically done and that's how you
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.080]  can beat this automated globalist system is that they just count on you
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:37.360]  complying with it by the way the tsa now says pay them a hundred
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:41.040]  dollars and they won't grope you wall street journal i'm not
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:45.920]  joking hundred dollars to fly through the airport without a groping
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:50.160]  pay them protection money i might actually pay it i'm joking
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:54.000]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.880]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:33.120]  friday edition thank you so much for joining us
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:38.800]  we have congressman jones joining us and i really appreciate representative
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:42.560]  walter b jones coming on he was the first one of the
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:45.680]  us house representatives in 95 serving 10 years
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:48.640]  as an elected member of the north carolina general assembly
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:51.920]  and he's currently serving his ninth term in congress and he's the only member
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:55.360]  of congress i've read about who's actually personally signed a letter
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:34:00.640]  to each and every family and and and written a personal letter to 10
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:05.280]  thousand plus families of servicemen that have been
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:11.280]  killed in the line of duty and then we again that is a personal touch it is
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:14.480]  so important that members of congress do that when
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:18.800]  they are ultimately sending people into these wars and we appreciate him
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:23.440]  doing that as well now as you know listeners because
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:28.320]  i've talked a lot about this representative jones congressman jones
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:32.720]  has spent a lot of time uh in the last week and a half
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:36.560]  pointing out that the secretary of defense panetta
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:39.680]  i was wrong when he said no we don't need congressional
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:43.760]  approval or authorization to go to war we get that from the un and nato
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:47.600]  we've seen members of the supreme court current and former say we should get our
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:51.040]  law from the un which has such a terrible past
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:55.680]  uh america has been the example of liberty not the united nations but the
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:58.560]  constitution article one section eight clause 11
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:02.560]  states it's a high crime impeachable if any president
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:06.320]  launches wars without congressional approval now when you do that
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:09.920]  not just on your own but say a foreign power authorizes you
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:15.200]  i think that rises even above a high crime and joining us is the congressman
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:20.000]  from north carolina walter jones sir thank you very much for joining us
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.280]  and introducing legislation to hold any president
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:27.600]  accountable uh if they tried to launch wars without congressional approval
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:31.040]  thank you for joining us well alex thank you that my concern
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:34.400]  goes back the initial concern was when uh president clinton
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:38.560]  decided to bomb bosnia without approval of congress i joined 31
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:42.720]  members of the house three democrats and 28 republicans
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:47.840]  joined congressman at the time tom cambell who now is a constitutional law
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:51.920]  professor at stanford university we went to the federal courts by saying that
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:56.480]  the president had bypassed congress and the courts did not take the lawsuit
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:00.800]  because they said where you in congress have the authority to cut the budgets
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:04.720]  and i mentioned that alex because that's always difficult for members to cut the
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:08.640]  funding for war because they don't want to leave the kids over there without
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:14.400]  adequate equipment and then when mr obama went into libya and the bypass
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:18.640]  congress except he did say that uh he has spoken to the leadership
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:22.480]  well that that made me even more anxious i joined dennis kassinage and john
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:26.800]  paternal is a constitutional lawyer at george washington we went back to the
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:31.120]  courts the courts did not accept by using the same
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:34.800]  position where you have the authority to cut the funding where that never
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:39.120]  happens i've been so anxious and upset that we in
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:43.280]  congress we never get a chance to debate the
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:48.320]  policy of should we still be in war or not in war so i decided to put this
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:53.600]  uh house concurrent resolution 107 in before i even knew about the
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:57.680]  secretary session excuse me senator sessions and secretary defense
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:02.800]  panetta and i would like to read two quotes that i think if so much
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:07.200]  credibility to what we're trying to do with this resolution one is for vice
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:12.000]  president dick cheney when we went into iraq which was an unnecessary war i came
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.800]  out against it and uh secretary vice president cheney made the statement i
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:21.120]  want to read to your listeners uh the president does not need authorization
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:24.160]  from congress before launching a military offensive
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:27.760]  that was dick cheney during the president george bush
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:32.240]  administration now let me read to you a candidate uh
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:36.480]  senator obama in 2007 and these are his words
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:39.600]  the president does not have power under the constitution
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:44.240]  to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.000]  involve stopping an actual immediate threat to the nation
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.360]  that's exactly what i'm seeing with this resolution
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:54.720]  uh if we're attacked then the president does have the authority based on the
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:58.800]  constitution but he does not have the constitutional power just to
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:03.680]  make a decision well i don't like the uh dictator in libya so we're gonna go
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:06.720]  then bomb him i mean that we need to go back to the
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:10.320]  constitution and this will help congress be more of
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:16.720]  involved in the debate when we go to war well said congressman of course
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:20.480]  senator sessions said that he almost lost his breath
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:23.760]  whenever he kept saying the panetta over and over again the secretary defense
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:28.560]  last week sir you know congress is over the war
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:32.800]  powers and you do need our authorization and panetta would say
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:36.960]  no we get that from the un so for me this is beyond
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:39.920]  the constitutional question of a president launching wars without
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:42.320]  congressional approval we know that's a high crime it's in the
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:45.440]  constitution a five-year-old that can read can see that
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:48.960]  that's a no-brainer because why even have congress if that's the case
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:51.920]  if the president can do it every once you've got to have checks and balances
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:54.720]  but to go further and say we're getting the authority
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:58.880]  from foreign governments in the un i mean that's like being a foreign agent of
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:02.880]  a foreign power sir alex it is not acceptable
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:07.520]  we have a constitution like we have a bible and the constitution says that
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:12.080]  congress will declare war that is why i've been so upset and i just
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:15.360]  mentioned to you just a moment ago in my history on this whole issue that went
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:19.760]  back to president clinton in bosnia in 1999
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:23.600]  for too long congress has been a spectator
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:28.000]  in the debate for war and when you see the amount of money that we spend and
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.840]  more important than the money the number of kids who had died and lost their
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:35.680]  legs their arms uh the american people should get behind and i'm
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:38.960]  pleased to tell you today i was honored to be on your show
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:42.480]  that we have had calls since friday of last week
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:46.480]  that we have heard from people in 49 different states
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:50.480]  who have called and said thank you congressman jones we want to help you
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:54.160]  get this resolution to the floor of the house and get this thing passed
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:58.320]  and uh i want to thank you again for this opportunity well i want to thank you sir
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:02.080]  now he's already launched the libya war last year in congress said you got to
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:06.640]  get our approval by the way we're for it uh the majority said just just just come
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:09.680]  to us and obama put that letter out as you know sir because that's how you
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:13.200]  speak about it at the time saying i don't need you i don't have to look at the
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:17.760]  constitutional question was a quote on tv but his letter said it i have the un
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:21.760]  and i'm doing this for their credibility that's a quote so he's saying i'm
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:26.160]  stating and setting the precedent that the un's the boss uh the congress has
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:29.520]  been handing over its authority but still doesn't mean that it's legitimate
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:32.960]  show show and i'm not criticizing what you've done it's measured
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:36.800]  you know you're saying hey do it again or if another president does it period
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:40.800]  we're going to start impeachment but but what about something like ron paul wouldn't
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:45.680]  that be a good constitutional move but also a campaign move for say ron paul
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:50.000]  to try to introduce articles of impeachment for the libya fiasco
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.360]  which they now admit has been a disaster and given al qaeda
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:59.040]  footholds and areas of uh libya well i have publicly endorsed ron paul i i am
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:02.880]  a big supporter ron paul's and i do agree with him totally and you may mention
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:07.200]  of this uh we we tried with what happened was our own
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:12.240]  republican leadership alex would not allow it even admit a
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:17.120]  weak resolution to condemn what the president had done in libya he would
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:20.320]  leave loud republicans to bring it to the floor i was so disappointed in our
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:23.920]  leadership republican leadership because they just set back
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:27.840]  set back and and like i was saying a while ago they became spectators
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:31.200]  we have got the fight to defend the constitutional right
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:35.280]  of the congress to declare war and this is a step in that direction
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:39.520]  we will get a hearing i hope i hope in the judiciary committee
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:44.240]  i know that the judiciary committee chaired by uh congressman lamar smith
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:47.680]  from texas who's a fine man and the ranking member who's a fine man
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:52.400]  john cogniz and we need to hold a hearing on this whole issue of congress
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:55.680]  and war and this is the start this resolution is a
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:01.200]  is a major step in that direction well said congressman
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:04.640]  what can we do to help move this legislation
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:09.360]  through the house and get it passed if your lessons would call the members of
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:13.520]  the united states house represented and i hope soon we'll have a senate
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:17.920]  uh uh senator to introduce the same legislation
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:22.560]  but right now if your listeners would call their members of congress and say
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:29.040]  please cosponsor h con resolution 107 all they have to do is to call their
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:34.000]  member of congress or email them or or fax them and just say please join in
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.920]  this house effort to to bring back the constitutional
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:42.480]  authority of congress to be involved when it comes to debating war
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:46.240]  and that's what they need to do and i can honestly tell you we had a
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:49.280]  person yesterday i was in the greenville office greenville north carolina
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:52.960]  and a gentleman called from colorado and said what can i do to help congressman
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:58.160]  james with this h con reps direct resolution excuse me 107
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:01.840]  and and uh we told him just call the your member of congress
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:06.400]  ask them to join call the j committee in washington dc and say this is a
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:11.920]  constitutional debate that needs to start and h con resolution 107 will
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:15.920]  start the debate again we're talking to congressman
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:19.920]  walter jones of north carolina and i'm glad people are calling and thanking
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:21.920]  him but i think what's more important
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:26.160]  is to call uh the head of the judiciary committee to ask them to get behind it
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:30.560]  and start promoting it to call the media and say don't black this out
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:34.640]  and to call people like senator ran paul and say look you've talked a lot about
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:38.880]  this war power issue your father has you need to cosponsor this
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:42.560]  immediately in the senate i would imagine that senator de ment
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:46.000]  would want to get behind this i would imagine that senator sessions who was
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.880]  so flabbergasted congressman would want to get behind this right now
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:54.640]  well i'm going to reach out to him monday we will be back in washington
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:58.560]  i've already asked my staff to call his office to see if he could give me 10
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:03.120]  minutes by telephone i i think he will see the value of trying to
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:07.280]  introduce this on the senate side and let's debate this issue it is time for
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:10.880]  congress to get out of the stands and get on the field when we talk
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:13.520]  about sending our young men and women to die
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:17.040]  what are folks saying in north carolina especially in your district the third
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:21.200]  district uh alex i'm not i don't want to mislead
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:24.400]  anything i'm a man of integrity and honesty and i would tell you that the
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:27.200]  phones the emails have been overwhelming in
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:31.680]  behalf of this legislation so well that's what i've seen
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:35.440]  now what about the semi blackout drudge report covered it
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:38.880]  i've covered it in full wars dot com covered it world net daily covered it i
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:42.240]  do a search every day a few local newspapers
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:46.160]  in north carolina mentioned it other than that nothing
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:51.520]  nothing you would think that a law to to to begin impeaching any president
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:55.120]  who tries to power grab like this that that they move
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:58.240]  towards that could lead to impeachment that would be huge news
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:01.440]  and you can tell they're scared of this because there's been such
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:06.320]  a blackout how do we force this issue out there
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:11.280]  alex i think letters to the editors or emails to the national papers or local
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:14.560]  papers my local paper they did an editorial that
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:17.840]  they did not understand that we had changed the word the president which
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:22.160]  mean only obama to a president and they wrote an editorial it's not
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:25.360]  overly critical but it just did not understand the intent
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:28.880]  i called the editors a very nice young man and i said i wish you'd call me
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:32.080]  before you did that editorial because you would understand
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:36.560]  that this feels primarily we're getting congress back into the debate
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:40.320]  i am sick and tired of being told well the other time you can debate
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:43.120]  well we should deal or not be in afghanistan is when we have the
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:45.760]  appropriations bill dealing with funding the war
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:49.520]  yeah i'm gonna be sure excuse me go ahead i'm sorry no no you go ahead i
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:53.280]  interrupt you no no no no we should have the authority
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:57.040]  to have when when president obama is saying when you gave
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:03.040]  president bush the authority in 2001 or 2002 and that's the authority i'm used
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:07.040]  forgotten it for goodness sakes 11 years later we shouldn't be debating
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:10.720]  whether we should be there or not be there sometime in that 11
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:16.000]  year time so this is a start on that whole debate quite frankly
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.560]  well congressman we've only got about five minutes left with you and you've
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:22.640]  got to run we just appreciate what you're doing my question is why don't we see
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:25.520]  more people why is it just you ron paul
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:29.120]  dennis cosinich you know got redistricting out of his
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:34.000]  his constituency rel wrote it out and so there's not many people that'll just
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.400]  stand for the basic constitution for those that don't know history
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:41.600]  it happens in third world countries it happened in roam with caesar
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:46.320]  when when a president or a leader the chief executive starts trying
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:50.400]  to take the military under their own control that's always the biggest red
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:54.880]  flag as you said in your letter dealing with this the cornerstone
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:59.120]  of our republic is the war powers is that the congress
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:03.600]  is in control of this and this is a this is the big one of the biggest issues
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:08.800]  out there well Alex our country is financially broke
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:11.920]  we're we're just the the young men and women
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:15.680]  that have fought for this country in afghanistan and latin and iraq i've
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:18.880]  seen the broken legs i've seen the amputated legs i've seen the
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:23.040]  paralyzed bodies the american people need to say that we no longer
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:26.000]  will send our young men and women to fight overseas
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.920]  unless congress does its job that is based on the constitution
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:35.040]  and again hcon resolution 107 is a start to get congress back in
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:41.040]  into the game of war well said look i'm not trying trying to tell
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:45.200]  ron paul sir what to do and i'm not trying to tell you what to do but
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:49.520]  what about if this gets ignored just going ahead because the crime is
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:52.160]  ongoing now they want to send african into all these
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:54.960]  countries for the globalists to grab resources
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:58.560]  they're trying to expand all these other wars proxy wars
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:02.800]  what about just going ahead with a move for impeachment perhaps if they're
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:05.680]  ignoring a law that says if you don't do this
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:09.600]  impeachment's triggered what about just going ahead with the impeachment i mean
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:13.360]  why doesn't ron paul just go ahead introduce articles of impeachment
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:17.120]  we've got plenty of it to go after obama and i understand you're seeing any
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:19.840]  president but i don't care if it's political
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:24.160]  i mean i i know you were critical of this when republicans were doing things
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:27.520]  similar but but but not rising to this level
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:33.600]  well alex i think if people like you across this notion will continue
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:40.160]  to beat the drum or hcon resolution 107 i think this will lead to other avenues
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:43.680]  that need to be led to that you're making mentioned up
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:48.320]  but right now it to show that my leadership in the republican house we
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:52.400]  are the majority in the house they they need to be speaking out about
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:56.480]  bringing this bill to the jay committee because it's important because we're
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:01.360]  talking about the constitution i'm with you a hundred percent
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:04.880]  well congressman i want to give you a closing comments here in the last three
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:08.560]  minutes or so but just bring up another issue that's part of this
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:12.160]  the national defense authorization act that obama said he wouldn't sign
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:15.920]  then it turns out he demanded this power to secretly arrest and disappear
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:19.360]  americans right out of nazi germany or soviet russia
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:24.560]  then he signed it you know on on on new year's eve so nobody would notice i
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:29.040]  mean this is really creepy what's the sense of congress about this
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:33.200]  well alex i think i can i don't have the record i think i was one of about six
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.880]  or seven uh republicans it voted no for that simple
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:41.760]  reason that provision in there is unlimited authority to a president
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:46.240]  no matter who that president is to determine who he thinks is a terrorist
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:49.280]  and it could be an american citizen and take him out
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:52.400]  i'm with you a hundred percent on that that's why i voted against
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:56.240]  well i'm glad you're there ron paul says he's going to retire if he doesn't win
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:00.160]  the presidency i'd like him to reconsider that night and i hope you
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:04.160]  keep running and keep waiting because there's not many good guys up there
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:07.600]  is anybody else starting to wake up up there
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:12.560]  slowly there are a few that are are beginning to wake up and uh just in a
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:17.120]  mosh for a minute uh michigan is a disciple of ron paul he's a wonderful
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:19.760]  young member of congress he's only been there one year but
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:23.840]  he he values the words in the constitution like i do
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:27.920]  uh and there's no two more important documents than to buy the constitution
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:31.200]  they've got to be protected well congressman walter

[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:21.680]  and you're not a suspect you're a person of interest
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:26.400]  well because we expose that you run al-qaeda you mean stuff like that
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:29.120]  so these people are just going into a new phase
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:34.000]  of flaunting it all in our face
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.560]  wow he's quoted in here global information surveillance grid being
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:42.400]  constructed willing americans embrace gadgets use a spy on them
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:46.560]  cia head we will spy on americans through electrical appliances
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:50.960]  and now that we've exposed that google was founded by nsa cia
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:55.280]  they just admit now that oh yeah the former head of the
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:56:00.080]  darpa runs it and yeah it's all cia director david patreus
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:04.400]  said he that the rise of smart gadgets means the americans are effectively
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:09.120]  bugging their own homes saving us spy agencies a job when it
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:13.120]  identifies any persons of interest and so it's like a big joke
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:16.640]  uh in a question and answer he did he's like we're just tracking you
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:22.800]  see they just convicted that guy who put the the webcam in their room with his
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:27.200]  roommate having sex with another guy and they're not
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:30.640]  convicting him for spying and violating somebody's privacy it's that it was
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:34.640]  hateful so see i i i guess it's only illegal if it's
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:38.720]  against a gay person see that's that political correctness how
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:42.800]  about it's illegal for everybody but why when schools give you laptops that you
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:46.640]  paid for but they say they're free another lie then they watch you at home
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:50.000]  remember that it's happening california and pennsylvania
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:54.160]  it's like oh yeah well that's all right the court say government can do that but
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:57.520]  but if somebody else does you're going to jail
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:01.280]  speaking at a summit for in cutel that's the folks that founded
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:04.080]  this is the cia investment arm that founded google
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:06.800]  this is a little side issue you know when you're informed you know stuff like
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:10.640]  that the cia's technology investment operation patreus
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:13.360]  made the comments when discussing new technologies
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:17.920]  which aim to add processors and web connections to previously dumb
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:21.360]  household appliances such as fridges ovens and lighting systems
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:24.560]  yeah i told you the police stations all over the country now are getting federal
[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:28.160]  grants for these these uh you know new light bulbs that can
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:32.000]  actually have data over the power then it resonates with new chips and the
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:35.360]  computers that then spy in your house and the the lights are
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:39.360]  programming things in your house and of course the cops are the first ones to
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:42.800]  have it put on them transformational is an overused word but i do
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:46.880]  believe it properly applies to these technologies patreus enthused
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:50.400]  particularly the effect on clandestine tradecraft
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:54.480]  items of interest you criminal patreus will be located identified monitored and
[01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:56.880]  remotely controlled through technologies such as radio frequency
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:57:59.520]  identification oh or if i'd use the spy on us
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:04.000]  i thought i was a conspiracy theorist sensor networks tiny embedded servers
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:09.040]  and energy harvesters all connected to the next generation of internet using
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:12.800]  abundant low-cost and high-powered computing that's the smart meters
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:16.400]  everything's a smart spy a smart trendy
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:19.520]  by the way we're getting a bunch of emails and stuff people are going crazy

[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:47.920]  welcome hi alec hi and i was calling because my
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:51.920]  husband went to la recently for a business trip
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:58.640]  and he works for an IT contractor and one of the men they were drinking of
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:01.840]  course and uh he started kind of running his mouth
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:05.680]  about the security clearance level he had within
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:09.840]  you know intelligence or whatever because most of it's like
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:13.040]  oh yeah a lot of people would slit their children's throats just to be given a
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:15.600]  security clearance and feel powerful yeah
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:19.520]  yes well he was talking about this and so my husband jumped on it and he said
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:23.360]  you know my wife you know reads about this stuff all
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:26.480]  the time talks about this stuff all the time he's like you know the big
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:30.960]  sentence with the inward barbed wire at lax
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:36.000]  and uh underground bunkers under denver international airport
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.560]  the guy just looked at him and he was like oh it's way worse than that
[02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:44.640]  and uh he talked to him a little bit about
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:47.840]  you know his security clearance and what all he was allowed to know and
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:51.120]  everything and then he kind of cut him off and said you know i'm talking too
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:55.520]  much about my work yeah well we don't need to you know
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:59.440]  these guys all they classify stuff that's actually public i mean
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:02.800]  last time i checked hundreds of millions of news articles had been
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:06.160]  classified they would classify washington post articles
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:09.840]  and what that means is when they read something in an agency they go this is
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:13.280]  classified within the agency because they don't want folks reading it
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:17.040]  like jad your hoover would classify within the fbi you know reports critical
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:19.920]  of him so really nobody's as deceived as people
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:23.120]  inside the system uh but but they feel like they're you know
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:25.920]  they've arrived they're part of the party they're
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:31.360]  and look it's civilian inmate labor camp program
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:35.440]  it's enemy combatant detainment program it's civil unrest
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:39.760]  a detainment program everything that's in the emergency centers establishment
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:43.520]  act is exactly what we'd already reverse engineer
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:47.120]  from congressional stuff news articles other things and sources
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:50.960]  so i mean when that came out it's like they wanted to expand the funding
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:54.560]  for what was already there and it's a the new economy
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:59.840]  is going to be arresting people the new economy is to disappear people the new
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:03.760]  economy is to turn the military loose domestically
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:06.960]  and i'm telling you it they're going to have big trouble they're already behind
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:10.800]  with their tsa all of it and a lot of folks are just going to say
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:14.000]  yeah i'm tired of this and when they try to come for them they're going to come
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.000]  looking for them so all you little you know types that love the system and
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.560]  hate america and hate freedom and think you're on the winning team
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:24.240]  boy you're sticking your hand in the alligator's mouth i mean i these little

[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:50.560]  this quick they'll do it i mean this is a group of crooks
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:54.000]  operating out in the open in front of everybody

[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:19.360]  get it out and the what i thought a week and a half ago has been proven
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:23.760]  correct in spades in triplicate in fact worse than i thought in fact i'm
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:26.240]  actually wrong i can't say i predicted it because it's
[02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:30.560]  worse than i said it is total propaganda for a boogie man you
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:33.440]  can just move around and they're saying well not just cony
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:38.080]  the resolution in the house says anybody that we say is hurting civilians
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:40.720]  the west doesn't care about civilians in fact
[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:44.000]  state department random says they want them dead
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:48.080]  state department random 200 henry kissinger looking up it's in our film
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:52.960]  that the ten minute piece the secrets of cony 2012
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:56.640]  it is so diabolical so it's just this hey here's the bad man
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:00.640]  here's the bad man at a sesame street three-year-old level
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:05.200]  they even talked to the adults in the video like who is the bad man that's
[02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:08.800]  that bad man now call us and book a screening
[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:12.800]  and and dance around in front of people and then you find out it's all white
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:18.320]  house run and they have cloney getting arrested uh at the sudanese
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:23.920]  embassy today old president help the people with the humanitarian mission
[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:27.520]  like libya bomb the country have the arabs come in and
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:31.840]  line the black libyans up and shoot them 40 000 dead this is not debated now
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:35.440]  we broke it here with people like dr tarpley that went there and risked his
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:38.960]  life and was in bombardments bombs went off you know quarter
[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:42.080]  mile from him he went through checkpoints you know saw
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:45.120]  tracer shooting by his car he's the type doesn't like to talk
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:48.160]  about it but i've talked to him privately i mean he was there when he would his
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:51.600]  phone would be knocked out while he was on the air via cell phone
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:56.720]  and it was total carnage so the new war is launched by a bunch of liberal
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:00.960]  trendies no more wmds we got to go to iraq or
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:05.680]  saddam through them babies had incubators now it's oh we're going to save
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:10.240]  africa when the ugandan president's been connected to all these problems
[02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:14.960]  nobody's seen cony in years this young lady
[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:20.320]  has really articulated as a ugandan what's really going on and it's not just
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:24.400]  her thousands of ugandans americans who happen to be of you know
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:27.920]  ugandan descent ugandans in uganda the few that have internet access
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:30.880]  they're they're having showings in fact show that one in telegraph article
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:35.680]  where they show it and the people riot it's such bull
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:39.520]  and then you learn that bono who's involved in all this
[02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:43.040]  gives one percent of the money for his african charity or 1.5
[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:46.480]  two africans with strings attached you learn bill melinda gates are running
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:49.120]  scams you learn this group only gives a little bit
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:52.960]  of the money it is so outrageous so i wanted to bring her
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:57.360]  up here in the aftermath of her video just one version getting over 3 million
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:02.000]  views to to go over this now now the ugandan
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:06.480]  government has now halted the the the screenings because it makes
[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:09.600]  ugandan so angry so it's it's not just this young lady
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:13.760]  who the pro county 2012 propagandist out there savaged
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:17.840]  she put her video out a week ago she's been proven absolutely right
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:21.360]  so she joins us uh son you thank you so much
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:25.600]  uh for joining us here today you've got the floor tell folks the the truth of
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:30.080]  what's happened and now in hindsight uh the the video you put
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:37.280]  out a week ago what we've learned hi hi the video that i actually made
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:42.080]  was originally for students at my high school i'm a
[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:46.720]  here in high school right now and what they were getting from that
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:51.360]  cony 2012 video was that there was a
[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:56.400]  and that we had to stop the war in ugandan help these ugandans and i was
[02:13:56.400 --> 02:14:00.080]  like what
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:05.840]  and so i see on twitter um when they have the most
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:09.920]  trending topics and uganda was one of them and then cony
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:15.440]  and in the video i mainly talk about how this isn't affecting uganda right now
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:19.200]  we're actually moving on from that we have moved on from that and i know that
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:23.360]  a lot of people are like oh well glr has moved to other places
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:28.720]  but that is not what the video focused on it focused mainly on uganda which
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:33.920]  really really upset me because every time that i go and i visit
[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:39.040]  i go to all different parts i have a grandmother that lives in the city i
[02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:41.920]  have my other grandmother who lives in the villages
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:45.440]  and i get the best of both worlds when i go there and
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:50.000]  every single time that i've gone there i've never ever had to like
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:56.320]  deal with this cony drama well a lot of ugandans have pointed out that he
[02:14:56.320 --> 02:15:01.040]  hasn't been seen in close to six years and and and this us resolution just
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:05.200]  says cony anybody that helps him or anybody we say is hurting
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:09.040]  civilians it gives african this excuse just to go into any
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:13.040]  country at once exactly a lot of people don't know about
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:16.560]  african and hell it's not only going to affect
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:20.400]  uganda it's going to affect all countries of africa
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:25.600]  and my mom does not have the conversation about cony with me because she
[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:30.160]  really believes that cony is dead every single time i'll just be like mom
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:34.320]  what do you think about the cony 2012 cony is dead
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:38.960]  and that's all she says and if he hasn't been active for that long and
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:42.800]  their reports that bush bombed his last non-location
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:45.920]  it kind of makes sense i mean the lra can move
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:49.600]  and expand and do whatever they do without having cony
[02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:52.880]  in charge well now they're saying it isn't about cony they just want to
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:55.680]  draw attention to their him but they're like first there was hitler
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:59.280]  then there was been laudan now there's cony but don't worry the u n's going to
[02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:02.800]  get all these cony's and they're just so happens to be one in every
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:05.840]  country where they want to bring in military force
[02:16:05.840 --> 02:16:08.800]  and we've seen what western military's done in africa
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:11.920]  uh there what's your view on that i mean you do you agree with my assessment
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:15.840]  this is a pretext to just start invading at african countries backing up
[02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:20.160]  dictators and others i do believe that i do know how horrible
[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:24.320]  president musevani is and i also do know that he is an ally to the u.s
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:28.880]  government um i also believe that the fact
[02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:32.960]  that they just discovered a lot of oil in uganda
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:36.560]  on the border of the congo as well as very appealing
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:40.720]  to the u.s and how they're not happy with them trading with china
[02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:46.480]  um i just feel like the u.s always has to put their hands on everything if the
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:49.920]  gigandan government and the sudanese government
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:54.560]  and other surrounding kenya they can all help out and if they wanted to stop
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:57.520]  these things they could stop them on their own but all these governments are
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:01.360]  corrupt on their own and to have america come in and
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:05.440]  act as the superhero they can't because our own government isn't even that
[02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:08.560]  stable well look at our supposed government i
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:11.680]  mean anybody that thinks they launched the war in iraq because iraq was
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:14.880]  involved in 9-11 needs their head examined anybody that thinks they went
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:19.680]  into libya uh to help people i mean obama says that was a
[02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:23.440]  peace war and that that was a humanitarian action uh
[02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:26.560]  and i know that most african countries and i've seen the polls
[02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:32.400]  uh no africans i know are buying that uh that that was actually to help libya
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:36.000]  exactly i don't think it was either and i don't think that
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:39.920]  this video that they put up is really
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:45.440]  bettering africa in any way it belittles africa to me actually
[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:49.280]  why do you think people are rioting all over uganda when they see this film and
[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:52.320]  demanding and not be shown even tribes that aren't associated
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:55.840]  with groups that koni was in the north and the government's now saying they
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:18:01.120]  don't want it shown in the country i think because
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:04.800]  that's a good question i think the reason why they don't want it shown is
[02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:08.800]  also they don't want these outsiders coming in and
[02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:13.760]  thinking that they have a really big outlook on uganda and through other
[02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:17.600]  surrounding countries because of this video that's not it like
[02:18:17.600 --> 02:18:22.240]  you can't form a relationship with africa because of this one youtube video and
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:26.000]  i think that that is what's angering especially for
[02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:30.400]  a place in the world that has such a little technology interaction
[02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:34.080]  and the fact that you have all these people wearing these
[02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:38.000]  t-shirts buying these bracelets like you don't know
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.880]  the roots of africa you don't know the history
[02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:44.560]  thoroughly of africa and what has gone on with like
[02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:49.840]  idiom mean and you don't know like what president mooseveni is doing like other
[02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:53.200]  problems that they are going through and i know you've got family there so you
[02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:55.120]  probably don't want to say too much about him but
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:58.640]  we've had experts like dr tarpley whose research didn't been there
[02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:02.240]  estimates are that president is connected to groups and organizations and
[02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:05.920]  himself in the last 26 years seven million dead
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:10.240]  and they're talking about koni who is like microscopic compared to that
[02:19:10.240 --> 02:19:16.560]  exactly and what what got to me was the fact that koni
[02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:24.160]  had child soldiers after president mooseveni did and so i was like if
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:28.320]  you're acting like he's the only man in this world who has done this and
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:33.520]  the fact that they advertise him as the world's worst war criminal
[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:40.080]  is just so it's so humoring to me like i just i think it's funny
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:43.440]  yeah well it is funny until you realize that these fake liberals prancing
[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:47.600]  around a really war propagandist trying to sell americans on getting behind new
[02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:50.240]  wars because americans do want to help african average
[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:53.920]  so they have trendies dance around and say we're going to help africa

[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:25.440]  this writing shotgun son you is a high school student
[02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:30.480]  here in america both her parents are from uganda she visits uganda has her
[02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:34.160]  grandparents there and of the ugandans everywhere
[02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:37.040]  are freaking out when they see this coming 2012
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:40.480]  and now the cony cult people are saying i don't care
[02:24:40.480 --> 02:24:45.680]  what you say i'm live liberal i'm trendy i want military action in uganda i
[02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:49.920]  want the african to invade these countries
[02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:54.480]  uh and so yes it's funny at one level that it's so ridiculous but
[02:24:54.480 --> 02:24:57.920]  it's very dangerous because they'll tell america that we're over there saving
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:01.840]  people and america will get behind carpet bombing the entire continent
[02:25:01.840 --> 02:25:05.040]  people need to understand this is dangerous the trendies are about as
[02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:07.680]  vicious as it gets and and they are never going to be
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:10.640]  told they're wrong they're going to call for probably napalming the entire
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:13.520]  continent now just because people are telling them they don't like it they're
[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:18.160]  like you don't like it here's some napalm uh son you uh other
[02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:22.320]  points you'd like to add joining us from your high school today
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:29.520]  um really it's just uh i have gotten obviously like a lot of
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:33.040]  negative response for these videos and people are
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:37.360]  judging me saying that i don't care about these kids and i'm like people need
[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:40.800]  to realize um when they're talking about the
[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:43.920]  lra they're talking about the children that they want to save
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:48.400]  and when there is military intervention
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:52.240]  those lives of those child soldiers that have been taken are going to be lost
[02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:55.680]  and i think that a lot of people really need to open their eyes up and
[02:25:55.680 --> 02:26:00.160]  realize that well plus i mean that's going on
[02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:03.680]  in in in every culture throughout history sometimes there's been pressing
[02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:05.920]  of children into service i'm not saying it's good it's
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:09.280]  terrible coney i think it's a bad guy but again you notice they always pick
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:13.120]  somebody like bin laden who hadn't been seen in years it's a perfect
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:16.880]  boogie man like he might be under the table he might be in the closet he
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:20.240]  you know and he might be maybe coney's hiding there at
[02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:23.760]  at your high school
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:30.160]  i actually like i just i don't know it's just so weird it's the fact that
[02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:35.200]  if he's hiding somewhere i do not believe that he has enough money to
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:40.400]  you know have a nice house to stay somewhere like he is probably somewhere
[02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:46.320]  in a jungle and like a hut or something like i don't think that
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:50.480]  people but if but if african invades all the countries
[02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:54.080]  that'll get him though it's not going to get it
[02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:58.800]  of course i make sarcastic right i mean it's like it's not you got over 90
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:01.920]  percent support on one of your videos it got over
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:04.960]  three million views so most people are seeing through this but
[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:08.560]  what type of hate has been thrown at you by the trendies
[02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:12.560]  um well obviously i can tell that they're a bunch of like really young people
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:16.560]  or even the people that are just so i my voice
[02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:20.080]  really needs to be heard and through this it can be heard and i can make a
[02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:23.120]  difference in the world and everyone is just like
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:28.720]  um oh you know maybe you should go and find coney yourself you're probably
[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:33.680]  coney's daughter you're probably part of the l r a your own self
[02:27:33.680 --> 02:27:38.560]  um let's see there was some one that really
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:41.600]  got me what was kind of confusing it was someone was like
[02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:48.320]  you are so ungrateful um our country helps so many savages like you and just
[02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:53.360]  because we want to help out your savage country and save all the savages in
[02:27:53.360 --> 02:27:56.720]  that country you want to get mad and that's like
[02:27:56.720 --> 02:27:59.680]  well well patrick hennigston investigative journal assistant are you
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:02.080]  want to comment on this i don't know when i hear stuff like this
[02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:05.040]  from sonny it really gets me fired up alex because
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:09.680]  it's the classical orientalist view that that westerners have been trained over
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:13.840]  200 years to look at places like africa and carrying the white man's bird and
[02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:16.960]  we're going to come in and we're going to save the africans
[02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:20.880]  we're going to save the afghans you know all the liberals who are backing coney
[02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:24.240]  2012 if you're listening now just be aware okay
[02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:27.360]  that the agenda for uganda and the rest of africa
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:31.520]  was signed sealed and delivered in 2007 by
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:35.680]  george bush jr okay and every liberal hates george bush jr but he
[02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:39.840]  that's why he's endorsing coney 2012 well he put african into motion in
[02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:44.240]  2007 african if the african central command
[02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:47.760]  objective is a child of the project of a new
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:51.680]  american century it's the stepchild of that you have sent com
[02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:56.080]  in katar you have african and africa and you have
[02:28:56.080 --> 02:28:59.440]  these organizations they sprout out of the it's a globalist invasion you've
[02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:02.720]  got all the documents we're going to go over those when we come back from break
[02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:05.760]  but going back to our guests who's joining us from her high school

[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:17.120]  key vitamins and as soon as i had that i immediately could eat half of what i
[02:30:17.120 --> 02:30:21.200]  was eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of great

[02:33:20.560 --> 02:33:25.520]  privacy but she had the courage a little over a week ago to say hey
[02:33:25.520 --> 02:33:30.880]  this whole kony 12 thing i've got family there my parents are from there i visit
[02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:34.880]  he's not even an issue for many years this something's going on here
[02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:38.640]  and she got overwhelming support but some still attacked her now
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:42.960]  since then you know a lot has developed our worst fears about this have
[02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:45.840]  been proven true it's a total cia front
[02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:49.520]  invasion force plan pattern was just making the
[02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:52.640]  pointer and the break it's like the last days of hitler the hitler youth
[02:33:52.640 --> 02:33:56.080]  when the propagandas that start targeting high school kids
[02:33:56.080 --> 02:33:59.440]  you know you're in trouble i mean the system is now trying to see if they get
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:03.200]  kids hyping war you know go to your parents tell them call for an invasion
[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:06.960]  a peace war like libya and then you find out that's their whole program this is
[02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:09.680]  their new push they got george cloney running around
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:12.960]  angelina joe lee you know just in five minutes or so because i know you've
[02:34:12.960 --> 02:34:17.680]  got to get back to class there a point you'd like to make to the world
[02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:21.680]  now you know since you originally put that video out
[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:24.880]  um a couple points that i do have to put out um
[02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:28.080]  through that video some people thought that maybe i wasn't
[02:34:28.080 --> 02:34:32.960]  in favor of kony getting justice yes i do think he's a horrible man
[02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:37.280]  but like i always say like people really do need to do their own research
[02:34:37.280 --> 02:34:41.520]  not just base it off of this one video that they saw through great
[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:46.400]  editing and effects like i i don't believe that
[02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:50.880]  they needed to exaggerate what they did in that video and the footage that they
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:55.360]  used was outdated and um
[02:34:55.360 --> 02:35:01.920]  and um i just i just really i just educate people like just educate
[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:05.040]  yourselves and research do your own research maybe you'll find something
[02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:10.240]  that i may not know and you can come to me and tell me that
[02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:13.440]  very well said i see somebody's trying to talk to you is that your teacher
[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:18.000]  yeah well go ahead and talk to your teacher for a moment go ahead
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.000]  ha ha or we don't need to speak to her that's okay
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:26.240]  uh you can leave her up just so i know i know she well
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:31.840]  okay great uh well we just appreciate your courage uh
[02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:35.760]  we just appreciate your courage yes you're on air
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:43.040]  okay her video broke up all right son you can you hear me
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:51.120]  she's frozen all right well uh we'll try to uh sometimes if you re-click it
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:54.080]  it'll come right back great and then we'll see when we get her
[02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:57.760]  wow uh patrick you have this whole presentation ready for the shower and
[02:35:57.760 --> 02:35:59.760]  they happen to book her right during that time but it
[02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:02.800]  you are going to come in and expose kony you've got all the documents there i
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:06.560]  mean this is an open and shut and it's so creepy to see them
[02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:10.880]  now literally going with the 1984 paradigm of war is peace
[02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:15.120]  yeah the the kony issue actually uh goes right back to 1987
[02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:19.360]  okay this guy's been running around the jungles of you gone in 1987
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:23.680]  okay let's let's take a let's take a lot a logical deductive
[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:27.360]  logic sort of view at things you've got a resistance army
[02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:31.120]  hiding in the guerrilla army hiding in the jungles of yuganda okay
[02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:34.640]  this sounds very familiar we've seen this in central america
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:38.160]  we've seen this in other african countries all over the planet
[02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:42.960]  there is a slight possibility and i would actually wage our money on it alex
[02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:46.480]  that uh the lord's resistance army has links to
[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:51.760]  either the cia or the mi6 or the massage or something like this okay it's not
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:55.200]  out of the realms of possibility and i know people are going to say oh my god
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:58.560]  how can you say such a thing well history is my guide
[02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:01.760]  well that's actually been flagged now there are some connections
[02:37:01.760 --> 02:37:05.440]  yeah if there's even a remote connection alex you know that the whole thing is
[02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:09.200]  absolutely filthy okay well they always finance both sides
[02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:12.320]  what what what musovini did he did a deal with obama
[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:17.760]  okay in 2009 he said well i'm going to help you fight muslim extremists in
[02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:21.120]  samalia musovini is the president for life in yuganda
[02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:24.720]  he's more or less a dictator in in those terms he said i'm going to help you
[02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:28.640]  fight the muslim extremists or the al qaeda
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:32.320]  i'm going to help you fight them in samalia and the reward yuganda got for
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:36.000]  that is 45 million dollars of military equipment
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:42.000]  which was delivered in 2010 and 2011 so the deal between the u.s state
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:46.000]  department and yugandan dictator has been going on since obama
[02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:50.480]  came into office okay obama is amazing george bush could not
[02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:54.400]  take the ball over the goal line for african a guy like bush couldn't do it
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:57.280]  rick perry couldn't do it any of these clowns who've got
[02:37:57.280 --> 02:38:01.440]  obama because he's a man of color he is the guy who's going to score the
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:04.480]  touchdown as far as the african objectives goes
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:08.640]  and we know the state department plan who's running all this is to cut off
[02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:12.160]  resources and kill africans that are never so
[02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:15.120]  it's not just like oh they're wanting to run things they're kicking out some bad
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:18.640]  guys they're just projecting on the icc website every
[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:21.920]  country's got a phantom boogie guy who hadn't been seen in a long time
[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:25.760]  that they're going to invade but the resolutions say anybody else we want to
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:29.600]  kill i mean it's just a license to invade and let me tell you i'm glad this
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:33.200]  girl came forward okay and because she's she's speaking from a point of real
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:36.000]  experience in reality i went to an icc hearing in
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:40.000]  london near the houses of parliament about a year and a half ago and they
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.320]  were going after the sidenese president at the time
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:45.680]  so they had a big multi-panel debate on the subject
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:49.200]  and all the sidenese there were like how dare you
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:52.640]  how dare you violate our national sovereignty you don't think that we can
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:57.280]  bring our own criminals to justice we don't want a u n or an icc coming into
[02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:00.400]  our well the u n only goes after people that resist them whether
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:02.800]  they're good or bad they go after some guys that are bad
[02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:06.880]  some that are good they go after anybody that doesn't let them rob their country
[02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:09.760]  it's a question of national sovereignty with the international criminal court
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:14.000]  that's what it is well exactly the u n
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:17.760]  that's what this is all about is telling that the icc is the final arbiter
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:22.240]  and obama is saying the supreme court justices are saying the icc is their boss
[02:39:22.240 --> 02:39:25.200]  they're saying they're the boss over our military this is global government the
[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:30.160]  kids toys all say u n force now it's no more us army and
[02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:33.680]  and all the feel-good people on facebook and twitter who are back in koney
[02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:37.440]  2012 be aware that your country the united states
[02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:42.560]  is one of the only countries in the world that it didn't sign up to the bogus icc
[02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:46.400]  criminal court in the first place because if we did if the united states did
[02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:50.560]  sign up to the icc ron reagan would have been in the dock for the
[02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:55.200]  mining the the nicaraguan harbors and there's a whole litany of crimes that
[02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:59.440]  could well iraq's or crime if there ever was one the end of the list is endless
[02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:02.800]  okay that's why united states is not signed up to this
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:07.840]  global but then backs it yeah exactly exactly i mean england would be on their
[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:12.480]  france i mean libya is a war crime it's all of these are classic war crimes
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:16.960]  and it's incredible son you is back she's there at high school
[02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:20.320]  son you were trying to finish any other points that you'd like to make
[02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:26.000]  before you go really i feel like i've said most of
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:31.200]  everything that i needed to say but um i just do think that people should not
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:35.680]  try and follow into this trend because it's more than just a trend
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:40.000]  especially that on their website they tell you just to sign your name and
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:43.440]  your email and these people don't know what they're signing into and it's
[02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:48.000]  really your supporting military troops getting
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.880]  sent over to africa and for all these peace people are like no we don't want
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:57.440]  more people to die this this is going to cause more harm than good
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:00.320]  what do you think about the way they talk to is it's targeting high school and
[02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:03.840]  college students they talk to them like an assessomy street level in some of
[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:06.400]  these videos like the koni movie screening people
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:11.280]  thought i was joking on radio when i went you know they're dancing like
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:15.440]  send the troops oh they actually are doing that and it's so it's like a
[02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:19.760]  money python skit but it's war but they're all dressed in you know pink
[02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:22.800]  pastels you know with effeminate guys going get
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:26.560]  coming get coming i mean it's a boy i'm gonna tell you the globalists are
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:29.520]  getting desperate here i mean this is some sick propaganda
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:33.520]  what did you think about that i mean i i don't think africans
[02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:36.880]  uh who are you know on record pretty serious folks like
[02:41:36.880 --> 02:41:40.080]  also the fact that the film looks like it's targeting children and is very
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:43.280]  mindless yeah it does i believe it targets
[02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:48.240]  children it reminded me of when i was in elementary school and middle school
[02:41:48.240 --> 02:41:52.000]  when they would come in and have you like sell things for them and you would
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.960]  make the money but you wouldn't really earn the money it would go to them so
[02:41:54.960 --> 02:41:58.320]  you'd win a little prize and this is exactly like the same
[02:41:58.320 --> 02:42:02.800]  things that they're doing except they're making money for on their own for
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:05.760]  this like i think they're connecting by giving you five
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:09.360]  dollars off a t-shirt they came to my cousin's high school and
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:12.480]  she's like yeah the t-shirts were like fifteen dollars and i was like they're
[02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:16.480]  more expensive on the website but they they try and make it seem like
[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:20.400]  you're special and that you have all this power when
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:24.000]  it's really yeah you may do but you don't know how to use it just yet
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:28.160]  what do you think abano of the the papers even the bbc reports gives about
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:34.160]  one point five percent of the money oh a fire drill we better say bye to her
[02:42:34.160 --> 02:42:37.120]  oh no that was my that was actually my cell phone
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:41.120]  what do you make of uh what do you make of this whole business of african
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:43.760]  charities and it turns out it's a total scam
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:48.400]  it well it is a total like one point five percent you said that's nothing a
[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:51.760]  little less than that yeah it's that's nothing like how they
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:55.680]  donate thirty percent that's nothing i looked into like feed my starving
[02:42:55.680 --> 02:43:00.000]  children and they donate ninety three percent of the proceeds and only seven
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.880]  goes to fundraising and the average that's right plug
[02:43:02.880 --> 02:43:06.080]  there are groups that give over ninety percent plug them right now
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:10.000]  and like well i i know for sure that um feed my starving children there are
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:13.920]  always those food drives where you could just give food cans and they would give
[02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:18.720]  them directly to the people and uh exactly it's just
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:22.480]  there's so much there's more than just invisible children and that's what
[02:43:22.480 --> 02:43:26.400]  people get through this youtube video and they blind everything else
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:30.480]  and yeah it's not just let's just help people with with with with dams and
[02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:34.080]  water treatment and seeds that's what really helps folks in shovels
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:38.160]  or food it's oh let's have an invasion it's liberal
[02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:41.280]  you're like no this is a state department run pro war plan here's the
[02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:44.720]  documents shut up you just hate the africans
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:49.760]  yeah that's exactly what they say and think like yeah you can feel good for
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:52.800]  posting a twitter status but that's not going to change anything and
[02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:57.120]  you can donate ten dollars to invisible children and there's a seventy percent
[02:43:57.120 --> 02:44:00.960]  chance it's not going to touch those kids and what does is going to come with
[02:44:00.960 --> 02:44:04.960]  strings final question for you i'm sick of angelina joe lee
[02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:07.920]  always there with the starving kids reaching at her for a photo op i mean
[02:44:07.920 --> 02:44:12.080]  that is disgusting and then pushing you in takeovers wars libya
[02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:15.520]  she's been right there as a cheerleader if she wants to say cony needs to be
[02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:19.360]  arrested for war crime well cony's not pulling triggers he's there as a
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:22.560]  propagandist she's just as big or worse than cony
[02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:26.160]  i say clap her in irons
[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:32.080]  i mean it's a figure of speech but i mean you get my point about
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:35.440]  these people that push war is peace i mean they're warmongers even if they
[02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:39.360]  label it as peace what's your take on that
[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:43.280]  was that directed towards yes yes yes yes sonia you
[02:44:43.280 --> 02:44:47.760]  it's just it doesn't sit well with me like people don't get it like
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:51.520]  you don't you can't just invade someone else's country and think that everyone
[02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:54.080]  is going to be happy about it and you're going to say you're coming for
[02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:58.400]  peace with a big gun in your hand no you're going to you're going to scare
[02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:01.440]  innocent people innocent people are going to react
[02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:07.280]  not in a good way and like i said it's just going to it's going to add up and
[02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:11.040]  it's not going to add up well and it's not going to end well

[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:50.080]  and and and people are waking up uh you're chomping at the bit you've got
[02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:54.960]  the floor patrick look the the cony 2012 uh campaign
[02:45:54.960 --> 02:45:58.640]  this is the ultimate act of desperation okay the
[02:45:58.640 --> 02:46:02.400]  what they're doing is when you have to employ children when you have to put
[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:06.480]  children as troops on the field okay like the last days of berlin
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:10.000]  right before the right fell the last people out all the other soldiers had
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:13.440]  already hightailed it out they saw the russians coming in who was left the
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:16.320]  kids were left the kids and a few hardcore people
[02:46:16.320 --> 02:46:20.400]  hanging deserters okay this really sad sad sort of
[02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:23.920]  point when you get to and uh for instance stalingrad
[02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:28.000]  they had nobody left to run the front line so they had to get the 13 14 year
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:31.520]  olds up throw a gun in their hand and put him this is not much different than
[02:46:31.520 --> 02:46:35.040]  that alex this is this is looking at our civilization they
[02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:39.760]  our politicians can no longer sell these bogus proxy wars these
[02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:44.320]  foundation funded trojan horses uh interventions look all
[02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:48.160]  with the new system alex okay the cia shell company system
[02:46:48.160 --> 02:46:51.440]  that worked you know in the 50s and 60s and 70s and 80s
[02:46:51.440 --> 02:46:55.680]  that's obsolete now now they've replaced that with the foundation funded
[02:46:55.680 --> 02:47:00.800]  propaganda trojan horses ngo's and these sort of feel good campaigns like
[02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:04.320]  this i'm sure that uh our friends from the soros found
[02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:08.000]  foundations and the ford the national downward democracy etc
[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:11.280]  they've probably got their hands in the koni 20 no we've done the research they
[02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:14.320]  do state department everything and you know i didn't even see that alex and i
[02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:18.160]  could just make an educated guess i can walk into the new world order
[02:47:18.160 --> 02:47:22.000]  casino and i can lay bets down and i can i'm just winning winning
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:26.000]  winning without even seeing because you you don't you don't even need to see
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.400]  the the documentation i was speaking to curtain
[02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:32.160]  him earlier we found there's some women's organization morocco
[02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:36.320]  who's uh opposing this uh rape new rape thing and they're all going crazy
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:39.920]  morocco of this incident of this woman who commits suicide because she was
[02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:44.480]  forced to marry her rapist okay a national league of uh democratic
[02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:47.840]  women or something like that in morocco sure enough there's a foundation
[02:47:47.840 --> 02:47:52.560]  connection which traces back to america okay i didn't even need to see the link
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:56.800]  and it's not going to end up helping women uh it's just some type of background
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:48:00.400]  thing to make folks mad at muslims so when they blow up iran well they deserved
[02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:04.000]  it that the the choke the the the tear jerking point
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:08.400]  in the middle east and central asia is is women look how they treat their women
[02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:11.760]  and in africa it's going to be children exactly and and better than children
[02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:14.880]  alex through the eighties from the from live aid
[02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:20.240]  from 1984 or 85 uh and save the children and all these unicef commercials
[02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:23.680]  that we've been had a steady diet of for about 30 years that's the cover for the
[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:27.120]  u.s slaughtering everybody that's that's conditioning alex's
[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:30.560]  media conditioning of african children and now we've got two three
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:32.960]  generations we're totally indoctrinated into this
[02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:36.560]  image of african children you've got madonna running down
[02:48:36.560 --> 02:48:41.760]  adopting uh some baby from black baby from and really what the un is
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:46.080]  is the new colonial government yeah this is the neo this is the new neocolonial
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:48.240]  government why are they so desperate alex you're
[02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:52.000]  wondering why they fact when you have to use kids to fast track
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:55.600]  a foreign intervention policy there is a reason behind this the reason they're
[02:48:55.600 --> 02:48:59.760]  desperate alex okay is because they are 15 years behind china
[02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:03.040]  in africa why we've been diddling around in the middle east
[02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:07.440]  trying to shore up our geopolitical arc of tension right from
[02:49:07.440 --> 02:49:11.120]  asia central asia right around to europe your cranium
[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:15.360]  we uh why they've been diddling around china has been slowly and steadily
[02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:18.880]  uh investing actual money building infrastructure they're there with
[02:49:18.880 --> 02:49:21.280]  generators and wells and like oh you you're not
[02:49:21.280 --> 02:49:26.000]  shoving a machine gun in my face you're actually here trying to give me a job
[02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:30.160]  yeah what you know what what the us has been doing for the last 40 years is their foreign aid
[02:49:30.160 --> 02:49:33.600]  program okay the foreign aid here's some poison food here's some vaccines
[02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:37.360]  yeah the foreign aid or food aid military aid whatever it is it's basically
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:41.280]  hey here's here's a here's a billion dollars come come shop in my shop
[02:49:41.280 --> 02:49:44.560]  which is shop usa and you can buy whatever you want as long as it's from
[02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:49.200]  shop usa it's it's about buying loyalty so they've been able to buy off egypt
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:53.520]  they've been able to buy off the government of india they've been able to buy off israel
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:56.800]  they've been all these countries they've bought off with foreign aid which
[02:49:56.800 --> 02:50:00.720]  americans think that it's charity the average american thinks that you don't
[02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:04.480]  really spend in shop america you mean global shop because it's not even coming
[02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:07.440]  back to us a globalist shop yeah well american you gotta buy it from the

[02:50:14.640 --> 02:50:19.200]  but this is the new colonial system okay there's a problem now the old colonial
[02:50:19.200 --> 02:50:22.480]  system they raped and pillaged africa for things like diamonds
[02:50:22.480 --> 02:50:27.440]  okay for things like certain kind of textile silk whatever
[02:50:27.440 --> 02:50:32.240]  agricultural products now the the new colonial the neocolonial paradigm
[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:35.840]  has changed because the needs have changed now it's about rare earth

[02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:20.320]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key

[02:54:04.800 --> 02:54:11.200]  don't worry this show is documented alex jones on the gcn radio network
[02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:14.240]  and let's be clear i'm not saying the communist chinese what they're doing is
[02:54:14.240 --> 02:54:16.720]  some wonderful thing but i've looked at their strategy
[02:54:16.720 --> 02:54:19.840]  they've gone in and bought off the government of australia
[02:54:19.840 --> 02:54:22.960]  and they're getting something like 98 percent of the rare of minerals that are
[02:54:22.960 --> 02:54:26.880]  mined out of australia are now by the chinese government
[02:54:26.880 --> 02:54:32.240]  backed corporate interest what over 90 percent it's like 91 percent worldwide
[02:54:32.240 --> 02:54:34.080]  the chinese are getting their rare of minerals
[02:54:34.080 --> 02:54:38.000]  they're actually trying to compete in a more free market way
[02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.960]  than what the military industrial complex does here
[02:54:40.960 --> 02:54:44.240]  yeah the uh the the chinese actually uh obama just um
[02:54:44.240 --> 02:54:50.160]  uh fired off a couple of salvos at the chinese today or yesterday uh and he's
[02:54:50.160 --> 02:54:55.040]  going to use the wto uh in order to uh play the part of the pit bull
[02:54:55.040 --> 02:54:58.400]  so you know the u.s the u.s used to be an economic power we used to have a
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:02.240]  manufacturing base what we've got left is the service industry
[02:55:02.240 --> 02:55:05.920]  we've got a bit of media and software and uh we've got
[02:55:05.920 --> 02:55:11.040]  retail okay the retail industry uh is totally dependent electronics
[02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:14.720]  everything and the defense industry on rare earth mineral but if they're so
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:17.920]  worried about those why do they let the chinese dominate again
[02:55:17.920 --> 02:55:21.920]  why did the west give them the panama canal oh here we we built it have it
[02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:25.440]  oh here we'll put tax incentives to move our companies over there because the
[02:55:25.440 --> 02:55:28.480]  globalist are playing us off against each other
[02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:32.880]  yep yep exactly now china is is china is very much in the fabric
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:36.720]  of the new world order setup as as we are or as europe is
[02:55:36.720 --> 02:55:39.520]  or some of these uh emerging bricks countries go over some of those notes
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:42.880]  you got a bunch okay well a lot of people don't realize uh
[02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:45.680]  know much about rare earth middles and i'll tell you what you better learn
[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:48.880]  about rare earth minerals because everything that we enjoy as far as
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:53.200]  technological advances from your ipod to your cell phone to your laptop
[02:55:53.200 --> 02:55:58.480]  to to electric cars okay to solar energy solar energy is dependent on
[02:55:58.480 --> 02:56:02.160]  lithium batteries okay there is a finite amount of lithium
[02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:05.040]  on the planet the other one we've got is a promethium
[02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:08.480]  that's uh nuclear batteries okay you are european
[02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:12.560]  and uh neode neodym okay these are good for guided missiles
[02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:16.160]  and a lot of uh advanced military technology lithium
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:21.440]  lasers and things like this lithium uh uh galak uh
[02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:27.520]  gad gadolinium okay this is a laptop and uh neodym uh cell phones so
[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:31.840]  cobalt and uh holonium nuclear rot nuclear control rods
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:35.040]  all these you know they're rampant they're building nuclear power plants like
[02:56:35.040 --> 02:56:37.840]  it's going out of style right now and let me tell you something else
[02:56:37.840 --> 02:56:41.200]  the whole uh darfur incident and this is told to me
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:45.520]  by a top consultant to the european union as far on the energies
[02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:48.800]  department he said there is a peak uranium
[02:56:48.800 --> 02:56:52.560]  issue okay this is a real peak issue not like peak oil
[02:56:52.560 --> 02:56:56.080]  that people talk about where there's plenty of oil on the planet uh to
[02:56:56.080 --> 02:56:59.760]  for to keep consumption for the next 200 years there's a peak uranium
[02:56:59.760 --> 02:57:03.440]  and where's all the uranium sudan the biggest deposit of
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:06.640]  untapped uranium and george cloney wants to help them
[02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:11.440]  uh trendy that's why the janja weed we're uh getting all the uh
[02:57:11.440 --> 02:57:14.640]  black again we get this black issue with africa
[02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:18.160]  we've got uh obama in charge uh at the helm
[02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:22.640]  the whole african thing he's going to take this through the next five years
[02:57:22.640 --> 02:57:26.160]  that's why i believe africa is too extremely
[02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:30.640]  uh strategic important thing for uh for america what do you think of my attack
[02:57:30.640 --> 02:57:33.760]  on angelina jolly obviously i did it so we get attention you say a rest
[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:37.280]  coffee and her band kind of doesn't happen you say arrest her that'll bring
[02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:39.600]  attention to it but i think if she wants to say arrest
[02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:43.440]  county and everybody well i think she's arrestable then well you know people
[02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:48.000]  put so much uh weight and importance in celebrities like angelina jolly
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:52.000]  and george cloney and believe me alex someone like my dearest best friends
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:56.080]  they just fall over for george cloney anything he does or any campaign that
[02:57:56.080 --> 02:57:59.680]  he endorses like he's got some kind of saying he's probably a nice guy
[02:57:59.680 --> 02:58:03.120]  he's a very intelligent guy he's made some damn good films right but he's not
[02:58:03.120 --> 02:58:07.600]  going to tell me uh how i well listen i like george cloney as an
[02:58:07.600 --> 02:58:10.880]  actor but i hate his guts because he is smart he knows good and well he's a
[02:58:10.880 --> 02:58:14.720]  warmongering piece of trash that's what i'm saying he's pushing all this while
[02:58:14.720 --> 02:58:17.920]  saying he's a saint that that's even worse than george bush
[02:58:17.920 --> 02:58:21.280]  who was a demonic goblin but just was launching wars because he wanted to
[02:58:21.280 --> 02:58:24.640]  because they're doing under liberal cover okay yes it's disgusting yeah
[02:58:24.640 --> 02:58:28.480]  just like obama's liberal cover a liberal umbrella a force field a
[02:58:28.480 --> 02:58:32.800]  a magic cloak liberal i'm liberal i mean look they have people now dress up in

[03:00:40.080 --> 03:00:43.600]  in the last few minutes we've got here to break down your investigation of this
[03:00:43.600 --> 03:00:47.280]  huge african invasion i wrote an article uh
[03:00:47.280 --> 03:00:53.920]  april 13th 2011 okay for 21st century wire and it was called the new cold war
[03:00:53.920 --> 03:00:57.600]  in libya and it was about the chinese investments in libya
[03:00:57.600 --> 03:01:02.320]  and how chinese took a major hit with the no-fly zone and the bombing of libya
[03:01:02.320 --> 03:01:05.440]  okay china is everywhere in africa they're in angola
[03:01:05.440 --> 03:01:09.360]  they're in zambia they're in sudan they're in tanzania
[03:01:09.360 --> 03:01:14.160]  they're in uh what's the other mozambique they're big in south africa
[03:01:14.160 --> 03:01:18.480]  they have been for the last 20 years okay china's got a major foothold
[03:01:18.480 --> 03:01:24.480]  all over africa okay african has in its documents and i linked to this on
[03:01:24.480 --> 03:01:28.880]  previous articles it says specifically what then african is a bit of a trick as
[03:01:28.880 --> 03:01:32.720]  well alex they say that the people's republic army of china
[03:01:32.720 --> 03:01:36.480]  might be deployed to deal with things in africa
[03:01:36.480 --> 03:01:40.320]  and that's why they set up african so the chinese wouldn't put troops
[03:01:40.320 --> 03:01:43.920]  in the african countries now i would wager to bet that china has no interest
[03:01:43.920 --> 03:01:47.760]  in military putting boots on the ground in africa china doesn't do their
[03:01:47.760 --> 03:01:50.560]  business like that look at china's record in africa
[03:01:50.560 --> 03:01:54.240]  they're into building investing creating economies of scale
[03:01:54.240 --> 03:01:58.880]  they put a port in angola uh that that country's been raped and pillaged by
[03:01:58.880 --> 03:02:02.640]  the beers and all these corporations for over a hundred years
[03:02:02.640 --> 03:02:06.480]  uh they have they have now a state of the art modern uh seaport
[03:02:06.480 --> 03:02:09.840]  in angola but again what's the schizophrenia here because the chinese
[03:02:09.840 --> 03:02:14.000]  leadership is really wicked and works with the globalist even reducing their
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:17.200]  own population they do is like a weird double game
[03:02:17.200 --> 03:02:20.320]  because i mean you know the west is saying get ready for war with china
[03:02:20.320 --> 03:02:24.160]  but then on the other side of that uh they're investing with the chinese it's
[03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:27.840]  really weird china china is just securing its own
[03:02:27.840 --> 03:02:31.520]  look at china as a corporation the people's republic incorporated okay
[03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:36.080]  they're securing their raw materials interests their rare earth interests and
[03:02:36.080 --> 03:02:38.720]  other the chinese know good things take a long time to grow
[03:02:38.720 --> 03:02:42.160]  yeah it's more of a long term view yeah if you you know you read the aiching
[03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:46.480]  which every every chinese emperor uh had had to have next to him
[03:02:46.480 --> 03:02:50.320]  since the the the way king wei dynasty
[03:02:50.320 --> 03:02:53.920]  five thousand years ago okay it's all about long-term plans
[03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:57.600]  it's about thinking ahead it's about the actions that you do today
[03:02:57.600 --> 03:03:01.360]  what sort of uh plants will they reap what flowers will they sow
[03:03:01.360 --> 03:03:05.520]  in the future that's chinese philosophy okay japanese is very similar they do
[03:03:05.520 --> 03:03:10.240]  everything in five and ten year blocks we do everything on quarterly reports
[03:03:10.240 --> 03:03:14.640]  which is three months you know six months 12 months that's how our corporate
[03:03:14.640 --> 03:03:18.560]  culture has uh become uh that sort of habit but
[03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:22.560]  they know the thing i uh really kills me about kony 2012 alex okay
[03:03:22.560 --> 03:03:26.560]  the they put a december deadline in it and notice the word 2012
[03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:30.240]  okay this is very significant because what they've done is the end of the
[03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:34.080]  Mayan calendar this might sound to some people like a load of
[03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:38.080]  bull but let me tell you liberals and hippies and people who into new age
[03:03:38.080 --> 03:03:41.600]  religions are really into this end of the Mayan calendar thing
[03:03:41.600 --> 03:03:45.840]  and the deadline for the kony uh result that they want to see happen in
[03:03:45.840 --> 03:03:50.240]  Uganda is about the same time as the Mayan calendar says that time and
[03:03:50.240 --> 03:03:54.240]  everything will end on earth okay so it's it's tied to obama it's like a
[03:03:54.240 --> 03:03:57.600]  campaign slogan so a liberal hippie hip a liberal hippie
[03:03:57.600 --> 03:04:01.440]  lovin for military intervention in Uganda
[03:04:01.440 --> 03:04:05.760]  okay so now they've completely lost the plot okay this is beyond crystals and
[03:04:05.760 --> 03:04:09.440]  tarot cards and uh uh um seances and
[03:04:09.440 --> 03:04:12.560]  Ouija boards okay this is really getting into the heart
[03:04:12.560 --> 03:04:17.440]  they've this is where new age culture is really invading into our our lives
[03:04:17.440 --> 03:04:20.960]  okay our political realities our social realities
[03:04:20.960 --> 03:04:25.040]  using facebook and twitter to share share share let's everybody share share

[03:04:35.840 --> 03:04:38.800]  spring to create a more of a significance than was actually there
[03:04:38.800 --> 03:04:42.320]  in russia they tried the same thing with the last presidential election
[03:04:42.320 --> 03:04:45.280]  two weeks ago they tried to make a big social network
[03:04:45.280 --> 03:04:49.920]  sort of presence there you know it's a virtual uh presence it's not real
[03:04:49.920 --> 03:04:53.520]  the the exit polls for putin were around the same as the votes that were
[03:04:53.520 --> 03:04:55.920]  tallied for him so that means that there was
[03:04:55.920 --> 03:04:59.360]  hardly any alright patrick great job will cover it more on the nightly news
