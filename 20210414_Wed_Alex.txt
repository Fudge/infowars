[00:00.000 --> 00:16.680]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.680 --> 00:24.760]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
[00:24.760 --> 00:35.120]  immediately following the death of nicola tesla dr. john trump an electrical
[00:35.120 --> 00:38.880]  engineer with the national defense research committee of the office of
[00:38.880 --> 00:43.680]  scientific research and development and interestingly president donald trump's
[00:43.680 --> 00:50.760]  uncle was called in to analyze the tesla papers after only three days john trump
[00:50.760 --> 00:56.400]  officially concluded that tesla's work was primarily speculative and did not
[00:56.400 --> 01:02.800]  include workable methods we are then told that most of tesla's papers disappeared
[01:02.800 --> 01:08.760]  but his work most definitely quietly continued heavily funded military
[01:08.760 --> 01:13.520]  projects studying the tesla particle beam are reported but more interesting
[01:13.520 --> 01:20.240]  than that is the mystery of systems in rotation spin although everything down
[01:20.240 --> 01:24.400]  to the electron seems to be spinning there is no official study on the
[01:24.400 --> 01:30.080]  science of spin or rotation but there are fragments and clues that suggest
[01:30.080 --> 01:34.400]  major governments have been secretly studying the science of rotation ever
[01:34.400 --> 01:40.000]  since world war two calling it hyperdimensional physics or torsion
[01:40.000 --> 01:46.680]  physics bruce de palma's spinning ball experiment from 1977 is simple enough
[01:46.680 --> 01:52.360]  for anyone to repeat two steel balls are repeatedly launched with equal force
[01:52.360 --> 01:58.280]  one is spinning the other is not the spinning ball consistently flies higher
[01:58.280 --> 02:04.400]  and falls faster than the other this is in direct violation of both newtons
[02:04.400 --> 02:11.400]  laws and einstein's relativity modern science cannot account for this energy
[02:11.400 --> 02:18.040]  the top secret so-called nazi bell project allegedly involved two counter
[02:18.040 --> 02:25.560]  rotating cylinders and produced anti-gravity UFO like effects and now
[02:25.560 --> 02:30.280]  the u.s. Navy appears to be going public with this science they claim to
[02:30.280 --> 02:36.720]  control inventions that change the fabric of reality a mysterious dr. salvator
[02:36.720 --> 02:43.160]  says our pay us has filed for patents of which the u.s. Navy is the assignee
[02:43.160 --> 02:48.960]  they appear to be technology for what we would popularly describe as UFOs and
[02:48.960 --> 02:53.920]  they're all based upon harvesting energy from the spinning of electromagnetic
[02:53.920 --> 02:59.440]  fields these patents look very similar to what whistleblowers claim have been in
[02:59.440 --> 03:03.960]  production for years by weapons manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin
[03:03.960 --> 03:10.040]  Skunkworks the same UFO like craft that whistleblowers claim are being prepared
[03:10.040 --> 03:16.640]  to stage a fake alien invasion after decades of deep misinformation secrecy
[03:16.640 --> 03:22.360]  and corruption why bring this powerful technology out into the open today the
[03:22.360 --> 03:27.200]  chief technical officer of the naval aviation enterprise claims that the u.s.
[03:27.200 --> 03:32.080]  needs these patents because the Chinese are already investing significantly in
[03:32.080 --> 03:37.280]  these technologies so are they rolling all this out into the public to prepare
[03:37.280 --> 03:43.240]  us for a space age war with China the subtext to all this of course is that
[03:43.240 --> 03:51.000]  there is no energy crisis only more lies and deceit for info wars calm this is

[05:58.280 --> 06:23.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide into violence and global
[06:23.360 --> 06:29.920]  tyranny on April 14th, 2021 and a very thankful you joined us on this live
[06:29.920 --> 06:36.120]  Wednesday broadcast. We have extremely good news here. You have to understand I
[06:36.120 --> 06:38.960]  put out all the bad news so that people can be aware of what's happening and
[06:38.960 --> 06:42.400]  make preparation to defeat it because I believe in you, I believe in history, I
[06:42.400 --> 06:45.920]  believe in your destiny because I believe in God that made us and I've seen it
[06:45.920 --> 06:49.920]  with my own eyes the power of taking action why the enemy so scared of you
[06:49.920 --> 06:56.200]  and your family and your will and your soul and your your your commitment but
[06:56.200 --> 07:00.320]  man is the New World Order nasty are they moving on all fronts and are they
[07:00.320 --> 07:04.160]  are killing and maiming a lot of people right now and so many folks out there
[07:04.160 --> 07:11.360]  that even mean well like Dr. Rand Paul like Trump still don't even get the
[07:11.360 --> 07:14.840]  full picture but they're starting to get more of it and if they get the full
[07:14.840 --> 07:19.560]  picture if the general public even gets part of the picture it's game over for
[07:19.560 --> 07:24.840]  the New World Order. Let me tell you what we got for you. Everyone is starting to
[07:24.840 --> 07:30.960]  call out Fauci as a fraud and mainstream news is now reporting that he ran the
[07:30.960 --> 07:37.720]  Wuhan lab which they're now confirming is where COVID-19 came from. Absolutely
[07:37.720 --> 07:42.640]  huge and then people say well I thought you said COVID's not that deadly but
[07:42.640 --> 07:46.040]  they want to own it and they want to have version one and version two and
[07:46.040 --> 07:50.800]  version three they've got super deadly versions this was just the drill so
[07:50.800 --> 07:55.040]  that's their ace in the hole when we come out and say this isn't that deadly
[07:55.040 --> 08:00.560]  if you have the normal vitamins and minerals yeah but it's got tricks up
[08:00.560 --> 08:08.080]  its sleeve too it's a mutinogenic virus five different viruses so we're gonna
[08:08.080 --> 08:11.800]  lay all that out today but it's not just news week coming out saying it last
[08:11.800 --> 08:21.640]  year now it's the daily caller a few days ago the Washington Times today as
[08:21.640 --> 08:30.320]  well is Dr. Fauci the father of the pandemic wow what have I said Bill
[08:30.320 --> 08:33.920]  Gates and Fauci are the fathers and I said Fauci when it comes to this
[08:33.920 --> 08:40.480]  operation is in command Gates is above him in the overall scientific globalist
[08:40.480 --> 08:45.800]  directive but Han showing the operation is Fauci whatever he says is taken by
[08:45.800 --> 08:49.960]  the UN and the Chai comes his law he's the guy calling the shots he's the
[08:49.960 --> 08:55.240]  field marshal he's the top guy and I've told you that ad nauseam and now the
[08:55.240 --> 09:02.720]  Pentagon is coming out and the CDC and saying and so there's something big
[09:02.720 --> 09:12.680]  going on where the revolution inside the deep state is definitely happening
[09:12.680 --> 09:15.880]  we've got that and I'm gonna cover that at the bottom of the arm actually gonna
[09:15.880 --> 09:19.040]  read the Washington Times article it is huge we're gonna link to it up on
[09:19.040 --> 09:24.040]  info wars.com in the full broadcast show page today there's more and more I'm
[09:24.040 --> 09:27.000]  not just gonna have the full show feed there we're always adding an article or
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.640]  a link or two we're gonna be adding more and more I talk about during the show
[09:29.640 --> 09:34.160]  every day to that page we're gonna add a link to this report and also a piece of
[09:34.160 --> 09:38.600]  it we also have something I've talked about for three days but I haven't
[09:38.600 --> 09:43.280]  detailed on air because I ended up perseverating on other issues and that
[09:43.280 --> 09:49.080]  is another bombshell nightmare enemy battle plan a another war plan cyber
[09:49.080 --> 09:54.080]  polygon 2021 globalist run simulation of a coming cyber pandemic to prepare for
[09:54.080 --> 09:59.620]  global reset we're gonna be going over all of that today hopefully try to get
[09:59.620 --> 10:04.360]  general Flynn on soon to get his expert take on it and then we've got the big
[10:04.360 --> 10:09.720]  enchilada if you go to info wars.com you'll see the big show page as we
[10:09.720 --> 10:14.640]  give each broadcast you know a name what what I think the top story is when we go
[10:14.640 --> 10:22.920]  live and it's just this poll show America is turning against Biden and and
[10:22.920 --> 10:26.520]  these are scientific establishment polls that are normally very very skewed
[10:26.520 --> 10:31.120]  and they're still skewed where they over sample Democrats by about 15% depending
[10:31.120 --> 10:35.760]  on the poll but even the skewed poll show the majority of Americans think
[10:35.760 --> 10:41.880]  Joe Biden stole the election because it's true and so the globalist and the
[10:41.880 --> 10:47.280]  leftist arm of the New World Order they can all day say that it's racist to want
[10:47.280 --> 10:53.800]  ID to vote but Americans understand that if they want us to have an ID to leave
[10:53.800 --> 10:57.240]  our house and a computer stand to go in a restaurant which we shouldn't have
[10:57.240 --> 11:04.400]  sure as hell when you go to do banking or get insurance or vote that's about
[11:04.400 --> 11:09.000]  your identity that you want that idea we're gonna have ideas period then you
[11:09.000 --> 11:15.400]  want them for this but notice they wait for the illegal aliens getting on planes
[11:15.400 --> 11:20.000]  getting flown to the interior of the US where no idea is shown which is a sign of
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.440]  true criminality you have the FBI quote waving the law which they can't do and
[11:24.440 --> 11:30.920]  that's coming up later I mean what to say we have bombshell footage if I don't
[11:30.920 --> 11:34.480]  build this up properly no one even cares it's all on Band-Aid video we don't just
[11:34.480 --> 11:38.800]  have three dozen women getting off a bus all pregnant with anchor babies nine
[11:38.800 --> 11:43.680]  months pregnant we don't just have what's obviously cartel type operatives
[11:43.680 --> 11:50.560]  would holy death tattoos all over them with little kids saying that other kids
[11:50.560 --> 11:55.280]  lying to customs and then being let through without IDs now we've got a
[11:55.280 --> 11:59.880]  bunch of girls ages 12 to 18 they told our undercover person who's a law
[11:59.880 --> 12:06.120]  enforcement off-duty with us they told us at the airport in McCallum Texas
[12:06.120 --> 12:11.920]  yesterday that they're being shipped to men who signed up online to get them
[12:11.920 --> 12:16.800]  around the country and they're waved through by board of patrol not TSA we
[12:16.800 --> 12:20.600]  put on airplanes and flown to these people and we have video that we got
[12:20.600 --> 12:26.160]  last week of the men bragging that they're there to pick up women I'm gonna
[12:26.160 --> 12:33.760]  say that again 12 13 14 15 16 17 no adults except one 18 year old girl who
[12:33.760 --> 12:37.640]  said her job is to fly to different flights every day that's her handing out
[12:37.640 --> 12:42.840]  materials she's 18 she told the undercover police officer we have that
[12:42.840 --> 12:49.200]  they are going all over the United States with these children most of them
[12:49.200 --> 12:53.680]  females some male so ladies and gentlemen we're we're watching stuff you
[12:53.680 --> 12:57.280]  imagine only in movies where they're handing off your old babies no one was
[12:57.280 --> 13:00.800]  like it's my baby my baby and it's a woman with devil tattoos all over and
[13:00.800 --> 13:05.040]  then she just hands it off to somebody on the other side no paperwork check and
[13:05.040 --> 13:09.560]  they just disappear and then the same woman is driving fake taxis and getting
[13:09.560 --> 13:12.720]  out of other vehicles and running everything she's at all hours of the
[13:12.720 --> 13:20.320]  day yeah that's her that's holy death's little messenger and she had taxi plates
[13:20.320 --> 13:26.480]  on this and taxi stuff on this they ran the plates and it's not a taxi but
[13:26.480 --> 13:32.480]  here she is and boy is she getting tired of us she's really gonna love it when I
[13:32.480 --> 13:36.480]  come down there in a couple days so hey what are you filming me for yeah lady
[13:36.480 --> 13:41.760]  we're filming you better believe it and folks are like well you better watch out
[13:41.760 --> 13:46.560]  you know ms-13 that's where tattoos are you better what you know what we'll let
[13:46.560 --> 13:50.160]  God decide our destiny how about that how about how about all you there into
[13:50.160 --> 13:55.520]  fear you just live in fear speaking of fear the FBI yesterday morning rated one
[13:55.520 --> 14:02.240]  of our crew members I'll tell you about that coming up next segment and the
[14:02.240 --> 14:06.440]  media is just an ex to see oh my god we're so close to arresting Jones we
[14:06.440 --> 14:09.840]  want to shut down info wars think about that it's not just take us off the
[14:09.840 --> 14:14.200]  internet not try to block our bank accounts now it's we want Jones in jail
[14:14.200 --> 14:18.080]  he masterminded the capital attacks you've been hearing that since it
[14:18.080 --> 14:23.600]  happened a few months ago three months ago and now they're just fixing the
[14:23.600 --> 14:29.720]  intelligence to go in line with all of that you want to see my breakdown of it
[14:29.720 --> 14:33.080]  it's at bandot video I shot a ten minute report on the last night breaking
[14:33.080 --> 14:39.080]  info wars reporter Sam arrested for covering January 6 capital riot Montoya
[14:39.080 --> 14:45.600]  so I talked to Sam's dad your stay he was here guess what he's charged with they
[14:45.600 --> 14:50.000]  said making loud utterances remember when I was there two years ago ran into
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.840]  Sunbar Pichai and I said hey Google's evil you're running death camps in China
[14:53.840 --> 14:59.960]  you're giving them our technology how dare you about like that and then the
[14:59.960 --> 15:04.400]  Capitol police officer says stop it you may be charged with disrupting Congress
[15:04.400 --> 15:09.960]  if you continue now code pink and fall down and chain themselves and they can
[15:09.960 --> 15:12.680]  yell and scream and the different Democrats and call for burning down
[15:12.680 --> 15:15.360]  buildings and they did all over the country last night that's loving and
[15:15.360 --> 15:19.400]  good but you know I just say hey how dare you build slave camps in China how
[15:19.400 --> 15:22.200]  dare you lie to Congress and say that you're not spying on the American people
[15:22.200 --> 15:28.400]  Sundar be quiet we can charge you with disrupting it's a new law we have they
[15:28.400 --> 15:31.520]  charged I'll destroy her with it last year and they're trying to put him in
[15:31.520 --> 15:35.480]  jail for it for remember we got a resident was silently protesting inside
[15:35.480 --> 15:38.960]  the Capitol redundant well they dropped that but the other one was when he said
[15:38.960 --> 15:42.320]  that had the impeachment of Trump as a fraud and he walked out of the Congress
[15:42.320 --> 15:46.960]  area he got in the door they let him in and then they they put him in jail they
[15:46.960 --> 15:51.720]  they've charged him with that well Sam had 30 FBI rating and is charged for
[15:51.720 --> 15:54.360]  something that's literally raising his voice that's right that's the new
[15:54.360 --> 15:58.160]  America but the left can burn down the cities I don't like coming to you and

[17:57.920 --> 18:13.960]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[18:27.920 --> 18:39.040]  well I told you on air that a lot of stuff's going on behind the scenes that
[18:39.040 --> 18:41.760]  I can't tell you about for a lot of reasons because it gives the enemy
[18:41.760 --> 18:47.520]  coordination points if we talk about what's going on but they've had all the
[18:47.520 --> 18:52.000]  major mainstream media Wall Street Journal New York Times all of them approach
[18:52.000 --> 18:57.080]  people and offer a money a lie about us they've had the big tabloids do it they
[18:57.080 --> 19:02.320]  have done Facebook scan searches on any body that even ever took a photo with
[19:02.320 --> 19:08.040]  me people to take selfies if I'm randomly at a restaurant these women will
[19:08.040 --> 19:11.440]  get a call from the Wall Street Journal New York Times saying you have a
[19:11.440 --> 19:14.600]  relationship with Alex Jones they go no I don't know Alex Jones I mean I met him
[19:14.600 --> 19:17.800]  once took a photo with him with my husband they go okay well we heard he
[19:17.800 --> 19:22.240]  raped you and they got no this is a preposterous and we then get calls from
[19:22.240 --> 19:26.880]  these people and have confirmed it so thousands of people are called by the
[19:26.880 --> 19:32.680]  savage criminal operators of just the actual leftist intelligence agency
[19:32.680 --> 19:38.840]  crime lords and then they control the FBI and order the FBI to then go and
[19:38.840 --> 19:45.040]  reverse engineer it like I saw a CNN article gates attended parties with
[19:45.040 --> 19:50.600]  drugs and there'd be some huge party in Miami or a big hotel suite party and the
[19:50.600 --> 19:53.640]  women went to the media to say he was really nice and he didn't give us
[19:53.640 --> 19:57.520]  money and we didn't even see him using drugs woman said I saw him take a pill
[19:57.520 --> 20:02.080]  once but he was really nice and the women were all 25 30 but that's at the
[20:02.080 --> 20:06.720]  end of the article and then other women go yeah I'm getting offered money to say
[20:06.720 --> 20:10.440]  Gates did something to me and it's not that Gates is perfect he's a rich kid
[20:10.440 --> 20:13.720]  he's a smart guy he's admitted he's a party animal hell he's for drug
[20:13.720 --> 20:17.000]  legalization and I'm not endorsing any of that but I'm not a hypocrite remember
[20:17.000 --> 20:21.120]  I've been a drug problem person but I've been in let's just say it up pretty much
[20:21.120 --> 20:26.800]  an alcoholic off and on so we all have our problems and instead it's like oh
[20:26.800 --> 20:35.360]  Matt Gates you know he's Matt Gates is a child trafficker and of course it's all
[20:35.360 --> 20:39.320]  built around some jet somebody rented and was there a 17 year old woman three
[20:39.320 --> 20:44.960]  years ago on the plane and then they admit that they the Justice Department
[20:44.960 --> 20:49.680]  people called him and shook him down for 25 million and they go on CNN on Chris
[20:49.680 --> 20:55.160]  Cuomo and admit that they asked for 25 million and Gates said screw you I've
[20:55.160 --> 21:00.800]  done anything wrong meanwhile where's all the arrests on the Lita Express with
[21:00.800 --> 21:04.560]  Bill Clinton and Hillary and Bill Gates on the plane with 14 year old girls that
[21:04.560 --> 21:08.160]  were commandeered and brought in and then intimidated and most of them from
[21:08.160 --> 21:11.840]  foreign countries threatened with deportation where is that because let me
[21:11.840 --> 21:15.800]  say they caught Matt Gates on the Lita Express with a fad say throw him out of
[21:15.800 --> 21:23.120]  Congress sitting to present I don't care we got an R before his name I mean I
[21:23.120 --> 21:27.000]  think he's a smart guy I like him I hope he's a good guy he looks like a super
[21:27.000 --> 21:35.760]  wise frat boy not my particular favorite type of people but that's okay I'm more
[21:35.760 --> 21:40.280]  of your caveman Texas type people some people don't like me but that's what we
[21:40.280 --> 21:48.560]  got going on here and Sam Montoya has been here three years and he's a good
[21:48.560 --> 21:55.440]  guy and as I always do I lay out on air what really happened from my perspective
[21:55.440 --> 21:58.640]  and then the FBI reverse engineers that finds out every damn thing I said was
[21:58.640 --> 22:02.440]  dead on but my lawyers and people are like I would not talk about this at all
[22:02.440 --> 22:05.760]  oh just so it's all over the news then they can lie and say I sent him in there
[22:05.760 --> 22:08.920]  and he had flamethrowers and hand grenades and cut pillows he's head off
[22:08.920 --> 22:13.680]  I'm not gonna sit there and wait for that crap so here's what happened
[22:13.680 --> 22:18.640]  everybody wanted to go to DC it had a carnival atmosphere and I told
[22:18.640 --> 22:22.040]  Harrison Smith and Sam and others I said no you can go on the next trip I
[22:22.040 --> 22:25.280]  think you hear you here to do the shows well we're all there and it cut to us
[22:25.280 --> 22:30.440]  live well Sam who almost fired for it but I was a likeable guy so I didn't do
[22:30.440 --> 22:35.080]  it but he came as close went around me and said well if Alex isn't gonna send
[22:35.080 --> 22:38.440]  me I'm gonna go with the my pillow people and he got press passes White
[22:38.440 --> 22:42.360]  House press passes from them for the main event and then I find out later he's
[22:42.360 --> 22:45.560]  in the Capitol that day and got the footage like Sam got footage of the
[22:45.560 --> 22:48.640]  woman being killed and I had a huge meltdown on the rooftop for a cussing of
[22:48.640 --> 22:52.360]  people I said I ain't supposed to be in Austin running things he's got footage
[22:52.360 --> 22:55.520]  and I go yeah here it is already on Twitter then I go why is it on Twitter and
[22:55.520 --> 23:03.640]  and not on us what the hell and then I Sam talks to me the next day and I go
[23:03.640 --> 23:06.600]  Sam you're probably gonna get in a lot of trouble even though you didn't do
[23:06.600 --> 23:10.120]  anything you know as a journalist did you do anything wrong in there he goes
[23:10.120 --> 23:13.800]  no no it's fine everything's fine I said that's not the case Sam but we'll see
[23:13.800 --> 23:17.120]  and here we are a couple months three months later and you see what's
[23:17.120 --> 23:29.000]  unfolding since January 6 30 FBI agents show up at his house batter down the
[23:29.000 --> 23:38.120]  door we talked to him and take him away and then I get the indictment
[23:38.120 --> 23:41.280]  affidavit and it's for disrupting the Capitol the same thing they threatened
[23:41.280 --> 23:44.680]  to charge me with for yelling at some of our Pichai and you know what if I have
[23:44.680 --> 23:47.560]  to yell at that guy in the halls of Congress that you're a liar and you're
[23:47.560 --> 23:51.040]  on death camps and you won't give the Pentagon the technology but you give the
[23:51.040 --> 23:55.320]  Chinese that I deserve a pat on the back for that not threatened with prison and I
[23:55.320 --> 23:59.160]  did it so if he's going to go to prison for what he did I deserve to go to
[23:59.160 --> 24:03.840]  prison for confronting Sundar and I say that's not justice that's tyranny so I've
[24:03.840 --> 24:07.880]  watched and I watched again last night the whole 45 minutes he shot live in
[24:07.880 --> 24:15.360]  there that he then archived with his terrible headline of Patriot Storm the
[24:15.360 --> 24:21.280]  thing on the band on video and we left it there because it's a record of what
[24:21.280 --> 24:24.840]  happened and the video of the woman getting shot remember we had the first
[24:24.840 --> 24:30.160]  footage out of that because Sam was there and did it all so then I got to
[24:30.160 --> 24:33.800]  interrogate some people here last night and check their messages and make damn
[24:33.800 --> 24:36.840]  sure when I tell you the story it's what the truth is and I said I thought I
[24:36.840 --> 24:39.760]  said they had to stay here and run the shows well he told me was going with my
[24:39.760 --> 24:43.080]  pillow people and then he got footage you give it to us and maybe we reimbursed
[24:43.080 --> 24:46.080]  him to be you know asked for receipts or something and I said so again as usual
[24:46.080 --> 24:51.280]  no one does what I tell them that's why I blow up and I shouldn't blow up and I'm
[24:51.280 --> 24:54.360]  like hey go shoot here at the migrant Catholic Center and then it's over
[24:54.360 --> 24:57.120]  fitting over here I've got to learn to not blow up but I usually have reasons
[24:57.120 --> 25:00.280]  for all this like I needed crew here plus Sam it's not that experience he's a
[25:00.280 --> 25:05.560]  video editor low-level camera guy been here three years and I'd say he's you
[25:05.560 --> 25:08.880]  know second string he's a great guy but he's not gotten trained up to that point
[25:08.880 --> 25:13.840]  it takes time and sure enough he went on his own volition went in there and I
[25:13.840 --> 25:18.440]  don't I don't say that too like me oh you know I didn't tell him go in there
[25:18.440 --> 25:24.040]  even no I mean I didn't but it doesn't matter he did do anything wrong but of
[25:24.040 --> 25:27.840]  course I told our crew do not go in the Capitol once I saw what happened it was
[25:27.840 --> 25:32.080]  already happening and then I learned with horror that Sam had been in the
[25:32.080 --> 25:36.480]  building and then I had to sit there and watch all the tape of it to make sure
[25:36.480 --> 25:39.600]  you do anything wrong because I'd fire him if he did and I was this close and I
[25:39.600 --> 25:44.040]  said you know Sam's a nice guy I'm not gonna I'm not gonna fire him and then I
[25:44.040 --> 25:49.000]  got to learn that his family member we know who it is because he told us how
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.840]  she won't even come to family dinners because he's a conservative and his dad
[25:51.840 --> 25:56.240]  is for big Trump supporters his family member one of his siblings won't even
[25:56.240 --> 26:00.040]  come to dinner with him for years was a Trump Sam's a big Trump supporter I mean
[26:00.040 --> 26:06.640]  I you see Sam at the RNC five years ago talking to me taking my hand in videos
[26:06.640 --> 26:10.640]  that Eric Andre shot I mean he's like he's he's he's been around he's a big
[26:10.640 --> 26:17.160]  fan and so we're praying for him be supporting he's in jail for raising his
[26:17.160 --> 26:20.960]  voice in the Capitol and they've got the quotes about who America standing up all
[26:20.960 --> 26:23.960]  this stuff but he was wearing two hats he's a journalist he had a
[26:23.960 --> 26:30.000]  presidential media pass he thought the president was going there the police
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.080]  opened the doors and waved him in that's why I went in and covered it he got the
[26:33.080 --> 26:36.120]  footage the woman dying yet other mainstream media there so that's all
[26:36.120 --> 26:40.400]  being died and if he's indicted it's all a fraud in a hope obviously to keep him
[26:40.400 --> 26:44.160]  in jail for a nonviolent offense to try to have him turn states evidence and make
[26:44.160 --> 26:47.040]  stuff up about me so they can put me in president shut down in four wars and
[26:47.040 --> 26:51.160]  that's their admitted goal and so I've got on my side I have zero fear and I
[26:51.160 --> 26:55.760]  just worry about poor Sam we'll be right back stay with us again I don't like to
[26:55.760 --> 26:59.080]  lecture people I'm a very private person but because of the globalist their
[26:59.080 --> 27:03.520]  attack on humanity I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure and
[27:03.520 --> 27:07.760]  we've given the globalist one hell of a run for their money because of God and I
[27:07.760 --> 27:11.160]  know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day but just give me
[27:11.160 --> 27:15.040]  a break the statinism's out in the open I've always been a Christian but now the
[27:15.040 --> 27:18.720]  fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear and I get it a lot of
[27:18.720 --> 27:21.920]  you've been turned off by big churches a lot of you've been turned off by the
[27:21.920 --> 27:26.800]  corrupt priest class system and I get it me too believe me I'm one of them but
[27:26.800 --> 27:32.920]  it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created that is
[27:32.920 --> 27:36.920]  so essential and and God created the universe for us to have communion with
[27:36.920 --> 27:40.200]  God through and to have life and so that's what info wars is really all
[27:40.200 --> 27:43.360]  about so thank you all for your word of mouth thank you for spreading the word

[29:56.280 --> 30:02.600]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[30:27.040 --> 30:31.040]  welcome back to Alex Jones show so there are now hundreds of news articles
[30:31.040 --> 30:36.000]  proliferating like mushrooms going oh Alex Jones is gonna get arrested Alex
[30:36.000 --> 30:41.680]  Jones is finally gonna get it we're gonna shut him up he's sending one of his
[30:41.680 --> 30:46.760]  reporters to attack the capital of the most vicious attack on the US since
[30:46.760 --> 30:50.800]  Pearl Harbor they're actually saying that this was as bad as Pearl Harbor
[30:50.800 --> 30:57.400]  asinine and meanwhile Sam Watea did nothing wrong and I understand he wanted
[30:57.400 --> 31:00.080]  to be at the capital I understand he wanted to go up there and I understand
[31:00.080 --> 31:04.120]  that he went around us and went with the my pillow caravan and he got
[31:04.120 --> 31:07.480]  incredible footage and here's footage of him shot by him yep the eyes used to
[31:07.480 --> 31:11.800]  indict him along after the doors are knocked down ever the police have weighed
[31:11.800 --> 31:16.440]  people in there's photos they use in his indictment of him between the velvet
[31:16.440 --> 31:20.680]  ropes so if you're a TV viewer you see Sam who's a great guy and I'm not mad at
[31:20.680 --> 31:25.960]  Sam it's just that I'm gonna tell you what happened that day that's what
[31:25.960 --> 31:32.560]  happened and he doesn't matter because what he did is not illegal I don't need
[31:32.560 --> 31:35.680]  to say that I didn't send Sam in there because I need to protect myself I'm
[31:35.680 --> 31:39.160]  saying it because it's the truth but it doesn't matter because you saw
[31:39.160 --> 31:42.760]  cabin on hearings where they took over blocked the halls through things chase
[31:42.760 --> 31:47.320]  Congress people on to elevators block the elevators did all that stuff and
[31:47.320 --> 31:52.520]  nothing happened to those people but when a couple hundred people going
[31:52.520 --> 31:57.480]  behind a few dozen morons that were violent and and who did do wrong they
[31:57.480 --> 32:01.800]  don't all deserve to then be indicted when the police officers waive Sam
[32:01.800 --> 32:10.720]  Motaya in and so we're trying to figure this out and get Sam a lawyer we're
[32:10.720 --> 32:12.920]  trying to figure out if he wants the lawyer we get for him we haven't been
[32:12.920 --> 32:16.640]  able to talk to him since last night I'm talking to his dad and we're definitely
[32:16.640 --> 32:19.040]  going to try to get him out of jail because they'll hold him for months and
[32:19.040 --> 32:21.880]  months and months till trial that they had it listed here the federal
[32:21.880 --> 32:26.560]  marshals are passing for a hold on him to keep him in jail Sam is about as
[32:26.560 --> 32:33.640]  harmless as a grasshopper I like Sam he's a very nice person very funny he
[32:33.640 --> 32:36.480]  always isn't a good mood I mean I'm not in a good mood most of time so I'm like
[32:36.480 --> 32:40.600]  always a guy this guy's in a jolly mood he's like Santa Claus or something his
[32:40.600 --> 32:45.120]  dad's a great guy and his family's great except for one person and his family
[32:45.120 --> 32:49.640]  that is in the affidavit we know who that is that that like reported it like I
[32:49.640 --> 32:55.280]  caught him I've got proof he was in the Capitol he shot it he uploaded it it
[32:55.280 --> 33:00.000]  was international news there's like all these other articles about Jones has
[33:00.000 --> 33:06.400]  been caught the week video it's always the same lies only video that he hates
[33:06.400 --> 33:10.920]  Trump no edited video in a TV interview that if I was a immoral person that
[33:10.920 --> 33:14.160]  didn't care about anybody but myself I would hate Trump because he's made my
[33:14.160 --> 33:18.720]  life a living hell and I'd be f Trump but instead I'm glad to be persecuted for
[33:18.720 --> 33:21.600]  supporting Trump he did a lot of good but they edited it because they're
[33:21.600 --> 33:29.400]  liars ladies and gentlemen and Sam tells people don't be mean to the cops Sam
[33:29.400 --> 33:33.720]  says things like you know these cops are scared and he got really really
[33:33.720 --> 33:41.680]  dramatic footage and so we left it up because he was operating as a journalist
[33:41.680 --> 33:45.760]  they're gonna try to say well he's not a journalist when he's making political
[33:45.760 --> 33:50.400]  comments well everybody can wear two or three hats you can be out playing golf
[33:50.400 --> 33:52.960]  and then say something to the news cameras about your view on apartheid
[33:52.960 --> 33:57.520]  you know 30 years ago you can be at a Star Wars premiere and say something
[33:57.520 --> 34:00.920]  about animal rights if you want it's two different hats he's there he didn't
[34:00.920 --> 34:04.840]  assault anybody he didn't hurt anybody he didn't aid anybody breaking in he came
[34:04.840 --> 34:09.400]  in later when the doors were open and they say in here he's being charged with
[34:09.400 --> 34:14.560]  disrupting Congress because he raised his voice and I mean you talk about
[34:14.560 --> 34:19.760]  timidly raising your voice he's about one one 20th as loud as I was yelling at
[34:19.760 --> 34:25.240]  Sundar Pachai and yes I do sound like a drill sergeant when I want to and I mean
[34:25.240 --> 34:29.840]  I did I'm genuinely mad at him I was waiting for him to come and now I
[34:29.840 --> 34:33.640]  notice they always do this remote stuff even before cover they do the hearings
[34:33.640 --> 34:38.320]  remotely and you know here comes sundar right by me and I'm like sundar you're
[34:38.320 --> 34:42.880]  helping run death camps in China it's true he deserves to be yelled at
[34:42.880 --> 34:47.320]  disrupting would be blocking him blocking the door shutting down the
[34:47.320 --> 34:51.360]  hearing I don't believe you should do that but particularly I got angry also
[34:51.360 --> 34:55.240]  because that in the hearings they'd been talking about me they did talk about me
[34:55.240 --> 34:59.520]  in that hearing I was in there for five angry hours and they said my name at
[34:59.520 --> 35:03.200]  least six seven times and they had Congress people pointing me out in the
[35:03.200 --> 35:07.400]  back row with Roger Stone going there's the Russians there's the spies right
[35:07.400 --> 35:14.320]  there I'm not a Russian spy you trash and you know it you're the globalist
[35:14.320 --> 35:22.000]  butcher in this country so again what I did was 10 times more aggressive than
[35:22.000 --> 35:28.520]  Sam and if he is indicted I deserve to be indicted for what happened I see
[35:28.520 --> 35:32.440]  that's how I operate because the whole laws of fraud the whole application of
[35:32.440 --> 35:38.520]  it's a fraud it's garbage and guess what Owen simply stood up at the beginning
[35:38.520 --> 35:43.120]  of a hearing cue that up please and all he did was say this impeachment is a
[35:43.120 --> 35:46.660]  fraud it's a scam it was a fraud they did another impeachment he then got
[35:46.660 --> 35:50.040]  arrested later a few weeks later for just being in the rotunda with a piece
[35:50.040 --> 35:57.200]  of tape over his mouth and they put him in jail for a couple days he said
[35:57.200 --> 36:02.840]  literally cockroaches all over him feeding on a skin and they're still
[36:02.840 --> 36:09.040]  trying to put him in prison for up to two years I guess as a statute for what
[36:09.040 --> 36:12.520]  he did right here so let's get up to the beginning and this is Owen shroyer over
[36:12.520 --> 36:16.580]  a year and a half ago during the first impeachment we will hear 30 minute
[36:16.580 --> 36:20.200]  freeze opening arguments from councils for the majority and the minority
[36:20.200 --> 36:27.200]  Gary Nadler and the Democrat Party are committing treason against this country
[36:27.200 --> 36:53.520]  crimes you are Gary Nadler you're the one committing treason America's a stick of
[36:53.520 --> 37:04.800]  all right so that full video is it made on video but that's just an example of
[37:04.800 --> 37:08.200]  what's really going on now if you watch the press conferences with Trump they
[37:08.200 --> 37:11.760]  were almost that mad at Trump at the press conferences and and co-pink does
[37:11.760 --> 37:14.760]  stuff even more intense than that and refuses to leave and throws fake blood
[37:14.760 --> 37:18.400]  around I don't think they should be arrested but maybe even a ticket but
[37:18.400 --> 37:22.400]  here's Owen shroyer another video for TV viewers where he puts a piece of tape
[37:22.400 --> 37:27.040]  over his mouth and watch what happens next here
[37:27.880 --> 37:35.760]  and take this sign out in the building today that I would be arrested well I'm
[37:35.760 --> 37:40.320]  planning on not even saying anything because I'm gonna put this over my mouth
[37:40.320 --> 37:44.640]  as an illustration of the censorship that I'm enduring now in the real world
[37:44.640 --> 37:49.520]  not just by big tech but by the Democrats and I was told I'd be arrested if I
[37:49.520 --> 37:53.880]  take this sign out and hold it well the removed Trump protesters had dozens of
[37:53.880 --> 37:57.000]  signs out here that they were holding are they gonna arrest me for doing
[37:57.000 --> 38:05.200]  exactly what they did well I guess we're gonna find out he puts the tape over
[38:05.200 --> 38:08.720]  his lips quietly in the rotunda entrance for all the school kids are at
[38:08.720 --> 38:13.760]  under statute and just stands there with no one even around him for 20 feet 30
[38:13.760 --> 38:18.920]  feet and they come and they arrest him this goes on for like 10 minutes you
[38:18.920 --> 38:21.600]  guys might fast forward to the end and they come and tell me not allowed to
[38:21.600 --> 38:26.280]  have that sign so that they say put your sign down we want to rest you oh but
[38:26.280 --> 38:30.200]  the left can all have their signs they can all burn whatever they want they
[38:30.200 --> 38:33.400]  can attack whatever they want they can attack police stations and burn them
[38:33.400 --> 38:37.320]  again last night they can shoot cops that's all wonderful the police will
[38:37.320 --> 38:41.360]  kneel the black lives matter in Antifa help a lay on their bellies but when we
[38:41.360 --> 38:46.520]  come with a sign they arrest Owen shroyer and make us spend tens of
[38:46.520 --> 38:49.560]  thousands of dollars get that charge drop but they're not dropping the other
[38:49.560 --> 38:52.960]  one saying because of January 6 they were gonna drop it they said now we're
[38:52.960 --> 38:57.440]  looking at it as terrorism he's told that I pay for his lawyer I talked to his
[38:57.440 --> 39:01.600]  lawyer last night Owen's down the border showing thousands of people a day
[39:01.600 --> 39:05.960]  including young children and babies being handed off to men and women who
[39:05.960 --> 39:09.720]  were not their parents and they tell our undercover people we're being taken to
[39:09.720 --> 39:14.360]  nice men that signed up who want us they're just being given to anybody who
[39:14.360 --> 39:17.200]  wants to take them and the federal government's offering four months leave

[39:40.320 --> 39:44.760]  screamed at even custody and they said it were really mean to him he said he was
[39:44.760 --> 39:48.880]  just blown away by how hateful they were because you're an American you're the

[41:53.640 --> 41:59.200]  humanity has been domesticated by and large the population has been trained
[41:59.200 --> 42:03.120]  to submit do what you're told it's all gonna pass but if you study
[42:03.120 --> 42:05.960]  authoritarians if you study the globalists you understand that they
[42:05.960 --> 42:09.640]  reach a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of
[42:09.640 --> 42:13.360]  being cold being totally enslaved and because the globalists see us as weak and
[42:13.360 --> 42:17.160]  see us as stupid they are now making that move and they are collapsing the
[42:17.160 --> 42:20.680]  third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world
[42:20.680 --> 42:26.160]  that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crises under such
[42:26.160 --> 42:30.720]  a load capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign hoping
[42:30.720 --> 42:35.520]  that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees not fleeing Covid
[42:35.520 --> 42:39.920]  or climate change as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying and Bill Gates is saying
[42:39.920 --> 42:45.600]  but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to
[42:45.600 --> 42:51.480]  institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money and that's why we
[42:51.480 --> 42:55.560]  have to really get educated about the globalist you know it's crazy to get
[42:55.560 --> 42:59.000]  to this point it's very bittersweet everything we've talked about has
[42:59.000 --> 43:02.400]  happened just like we said it would and now we have a lot of credibility but I
[43:02.400 --> 43:05.360]  don't care about that I care about beating the new world order and it's
[43:05.360 --> 43:09.040]  because we have so much credibility they can't allow us to stay on air much
[43:09.040 --> 43:12.680]  longer and I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a
[43:12.680 --> 43:16.040]  lot of reasons I can't tell you what's going on but let's just say this we're
[43:16.040 --> 43:20.440]  gonna see this through the end we're gonna stay on air as long as we can so
[43:20.440 --> 43:23.640]  please pray for us and please buy the products and then forward store.com
[43:23.640 --> 43:27.800]  they're great products plus they fund the operation so you know unlike other

[43:31.040 --> 43:35.800]  don't these are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole
[43:35.800 --> 43:39.560]  world's waking up and looking for truth that's why the globalists are censoring
[43:39.560 --> 43:43.600]  they can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air so while
[43:43.600 --> 43:46.800]  you're at it don't just financially support us and spread the word download
[43:46.800 --> 43:50.320]  everything we've done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're
[43:50.320 --> 43:55.440]  going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said
[43:55.440 --> 44:09.120]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[44:25.760 --> 44:31.360]  all right I've got constitutional lawyer Norm Pattis to talk about the Capitol
[44:31.360 --> 44:34.160]  arrest and why it affects everything because they're setting the precedent
[44:34.160 --> 44:38.440]  that your speech and your protest is basically illegal and that's what
[44:38.440 --> 44:41.000]  Democrats are calling for they don't want to just ban you in cyberspace they
[44:41.000 --> 44:44.560]  want to ban you existing he'll be popping in bottom of the next hour but I
[44:44.560 --> 44:55.520]  really need to get to the my say incredible this is beyond incredible
[44:55.520 --> 45:04.440]  information dealing with the great awakening that is taking place if you
[45:04.440 --> 45:10.560]  go to the main feed of the show today we can put that on screen I sum it up and
[45:10.560 --> 45:17.040]  it's absolutely true Wednesday live polls show America is completely turning
[45:17.040 --> 45:21.760]  against Joe Biden election theft has only accelerated the great awakening and I
[45:21.760 --> 45:26.240]  don't just believe one poll or another and I know how to go into the methodology
[45:26.240 --> 45:28.440]  of the polls and look at them and I've been looking at them but also look at
[45:28.440 --> 45:41.880]  what's happening on the street but look at this Rasmussen poll 51% of Americans
[45:43.360 --> 45:48.360]  across the board of voters non-voters Republicans Democrats believe Joe Biden
[45:48.360 --> 45:59.520]  stole the election 74% of Republicans say it's likely there was cheating against
[45:59.520 --> 46:05.720]  Republicans and 30% of Democrats I mean these are just whopping numbers because
[46:05.720 --> 46:09.320]  when you remember that they oversample on these polls Democrats and then they
[46:09.320 --> 46:12.800]  admitted this poll they did as well this is just it's just considered like a
[46:12.800 --> 46:17.360]  factors more Democrats the Republicans when it's actually opposite this is so
[46:17.360 --> 46:22.360]  huge and then I've got a whole other stack of news showing that Biden is
[46:22.360 --> 46:25.640]  being completely rejected and so is Kamala Harris yeah what were they
[46:25.640 --> 46:32.680]  thinking Kamala got less than half a point with general voters and less than
[46:32.680 --> 46:38.200]  a quarter point that's dead last out of the 15 Democrats in the field during the
[46:38.200 --> 46:45.360]  primaries I mean half a point is not a pulse ladies and gentlemen it doesn't
[46:45.360 --> 46:49.600]  even exist because if you got 15 people and you're asking people to pull who
[46:49.600 --> 46:52.560]  they're for a lot of folks don't even know the names they'll just randomly pick
[46:52.560 --> 46:56.720]  one you've got a better chance of being two or three percent out of 15 even if
[46:56.720 --> 46:59.400]  people don't even know who the names are they just randomly throw a dart and hit
[46:59.400 --> 47:05.400]  your name when you're at half a point man you are hated she's loathsome I can't
[47:05.400 --> 47:11.400]  look at her because she looks so damn fake and the cackling and the fakeness and
[47:11.400 --> 47:21.760]  the weirdness everybody knows Tony you smell it you see it you feel it and and
[47:21.760 --> 47:25.720]  then Joe Biden used to have a little bit of charisma you can still tell he was a
[47:25.720 --> 47:30.440]  liar he had like a little bit of used car salesman charisma now he's like the
[47:30.440 --> 47:37.880]  crypt paper so what are they gonna do as everything falls apart okay successfully
[47:37.880 --> 47:41.920]  election now everybody knows you did it that's what Robert Barnes always talked
[47:41.920 --> 47:52.480]  about was the 1830 election and the election previous to that when they
[47:52.480 --> 47:57.600]  stole it from Andrew Jackson and everybody knew they stole it so he won
[47:57.600 --> 48:04.360]  by an even bigger landslide the next time very very important so next hour
[48:04.360 --> 48:10.040]  we're gonna be looking into that poll and this whole stack of the wheels coming
[48:10.040 --> 48:14.680]  off the Democratic Party that I've got right here and that we can just deal
[48:14.680 --> 48:22.240]  with the blue blood Republicans and and not let them control the party we're
[48:22.240 --> 48:25.880]  gonna be able to defeat these people and then separately I'm mixed into my stacks
[48:25.880 --> 48:31.160]  and I can't find it I was about to hit it will you guys get me the new John
[48:31.160 --> 48:35.160]  Hopkins cyber collapse document the Jamie White wrote I've got the document
[48:35.160 --> 48:37.560]  but I can't find always on the bottom I did find it
[48:37.560 --> 48:45.320]  ah cyber polygon 2021 globalist run simulation of coming cyber pandemic
[48:45.320 --> 48:50.200]  prepare for economic reset this is the blueprint till you John Hopkins is like
[48:50.200 --> 48:53.360]  the main horse in the fight down against this all the globalists do their
[48:53.360 --> 48:55.760]  tests their drills they agree at committee what they're gonna do that's
[48:55.760 --> 48:59.400]  given to these academics and business people and top scientists and in the
[48:59.400 --> 49:03.680]  top of their fields academia banking computer science weapons
[49:03.680 --> 49:08.120]  psychology psychology then they launch the attack I'm gonna be hitting that as
[49:08.120 --> 49:13.000]  well I've got to hit that because it shows how they first want to lock us
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  down with a virus but they're really gonna lock us down by taking everybody's
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.560]  bank accounts and changing the currencies and trying to make us all go on a
[49:19.560 --> 49:24.480]  digital system where they give you free money on your phone every month but just
[49:24.480 --> 49:28.320]  enough to live but you've got to capitulate to all of the agreements they
[49:28.320 --> 49:33.280]  want you to sign and that's in all the great reset documents but now they're
[49:33.280 --> 49:36.520]  preparing to go operational with it so you have to sign an agreement that you're
[49:36.520 --> 49:42.160]  bad and that you know that your future earnings will go into this pool and so
[49:42.160 --> 49:46.160]  during the long depression they get everybody to sign on to it but then
[49:46.160 --> 49:49.200]  after that they own you as indentured servants but they claim that that's
[49:49.200 --> 49:52.600]  freedom so every time they claim something's freedom you know it's slavery
[49:52.600 --> 49:56.280]  they call something slavery you know it's freedom it's nine times out of ten
[49:56.280 --> 49:59.920]  just reverse whatever they're saying because they've already inverted it and
[49:59.920 --> 50:05.000]  it'll be back the way it's supposed to be so we've got that incredible news and
[50:05.000 --> 50:11.120]  information coming up but the first thing I want to hit when we come back is
[50:11.120 --> 50:16.280]  the end of Fauci and how beautiful this is and how despite all the propaganda and
[50:16.280 --> 50:19.040]  all their big tech censorship and all the King's forces and all the Kingsman
[50:19.040 --> 50:24.840]  Fauci's really the head operator in this part of the operation he's the guy
[50:24.840 --> 50:29.000]  that does the talking points the PR but he ran the Wuhan lab he ran the
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.960]  operation he ran the weaponization and now it's mainstream news that he did
[50:32.960 --> 50:42.720]  look at this headline overhead shot please is Dr. Fauci the father of the
[50:42.720 --> 50:53.360]  pandemic the Washington Times daily caller Newsweek how the free world died
[50:53.360 --> 50:57.160]  at COVID-19 well if we wake up to it we don't have to die it can be our
[50:57.160 --> 51:02.040]  political and cultural and spiritual resurrection and Rand Paul is called
[51:02.040 --> 51:05.320]  him out called him a tyrant and now calling him a fearmonger who should be
[51:05.320 --> 51:13.800]  voluntarily taken off TV so that is all coming up at the start of the next hour
[51:13.800 --> 51:17.880]  let me spend a few minutes here talking about something very exciting that we're
[51:17.880 --> 51:24.520]  doing and that's operation in game my seminal film 14 years ago it's evergreen
[51:24.520 --> 51:28.360]  it's more important now than when I made it because 90% of its come true exactly
[51:28.360 --> 51:33.480]  as I said that would because I'm going off the enemy's own documents club of
[51:33.480 --> 51:39.000]  Rome CFR Bilderberg group Rockefeller Foundation it's all here in game
[51:39.000 --> 51:42.160]  blueprint for global enslavement with the extras everything else is like almost
[51:42.160 --> 51:49.400]  four hours of footage we're selling it for $3.95 when you buy in bulk you buy
[51:49.400 --> 51:53.400]  one it's 1495 you buy two they're 995 it just goes down from there but here's
[51:53.400 --> 51:57.560]  the goodness every DVD has a zero country code whether you're in Russia
[51:57.560 --> 52:02.040]  whether you're in China whether you're in Mexico whether you are in Canada it
[52:02.040 --> 52:05.400]  doesn't matter where you are you can make copies
[52:05.400 --> 52:09.880]  so get a DVD burner and tell folks hey you got DVD player here's the forbidden
[52:09.880 --> 52:12.440]  cruise you're not supposed to know here's what's been banned by Amazon and
[52:12.440 --> 52:15.800]  Google and all of it here's what they don't want you to know get it and make
[52:15.800 --> 52:18.880]  copies of it and then give the nice color copy you know with the color
[52:18.880 --> 52:22.840]  covered everything to your library once you're done making copies of it or if
[52:22.840 --> 52:24.680]  you want to get all your Christmas shopping done you know six months
[52:24.680 --> 52:29.440]  earlier whatever you can just simply buy these in bulk then give them as gifts
[52:29.440 --> 52:32.320]  now and say here's a Christmas present earlier I mean this is the gift of
[52:32.320 --> 52:38.440]  knowledge this should be shown to your local rotary clubs people are ready for
[52:38.440 --> 52:42.640]  this now operation in-game and we ordered 20,000 of these I'm very excited to
[52:42.640 --> 52:45.800]  say we've already sold out of a third of them and so it's great people get them
[52:45.800 --> 52:49.960]  and then it funds the operation we get a few bucks each DVD to fund ourselves and
[52:49.960 --> 52:56.160]  then finally vitamin mineral fusion is very hard for us to get because it's
[52:56.160 --> 53:00.240]  got all the vitamins all the minerals from good healthy organic sources with
[53:00.240 --> 53:04.760]  key amino acids and so it's these big complex products that with the COVID
[53:04.760 --> 53:08.120]  lockdowns and the shutdowns and the supply chain breakdowns around the world
[53:08.120 --> 53:10.960]  that you read about everywhere this is one of the products it's hard to get so
[53:10.960 --> 53:13.680]  we've been getting limited shipments of these or we'd always have it in because

[55:45.920 --> 55:49.240]  lecture people I'm a very private person but because of the globalist their
[55:49.240 --> 55:53.160]  attack on humanity I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure and
[55:53.160 --> 55:57.880]  we've given the globalist one hell of a run for their money because of God and I
[55:57.880 --> 56:01.360]  know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day but just give me a
[56:01.360 --> 56:05.200]  break the Satanism's out in the open I've always been a Christian but now the
[56:05.200 --> 56:08.880]  fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear and I get it a lot of
[56:08.880 --> 56:12.040]  you've been turned off by big churches a lot of you've been turned off by the
[56:12.040 --> 56:16.920]  corrupt priest class system and I get it me too believe me I'm one of them but
[56:16.920 --> 56:22.920]  it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created that
[56:22.920 --> 56:27.080]  is so essential and and God created the universe for us to have communion with
[56:27.080 --> 56:30.360]  God through and to have life and so that's what info wars is really all
[56:30.360 --> 56:33.520]  about so thank you all for your word of mouth thank you for spreading the word
[56:33.520 --> 56:36.600]  about info wars and thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by
[56:36.600 --> 56:40.480]  visiting infowarstore.com because without your daily and weekly monthly
[56:40.480 --> 56:45.920]  purchases we'll be taken off the air so thank you for the support infowarstore.com
[56:45.920 --> 56:52.240]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[57:15.920 --> 57:30.840]  all right I saw a pretty powerful video this morning and I looked it up and it's
[57:30.840 --> 57:37.880]  a it's a it's a reporter reading with Dr. Derek Knoss had to say and I already
[57:37.880 --> 57:40.480]  looked this up and it's basically true that's why they say there's no flu now
[57:40.480 --> 57:44.440]  because they're they're just counting all the different types of influenza and
[57:44.440 --> 57:49.040]  other cold viruses is COVID that's why they created a fake virus that they own
[57:49.040 --> 57:52.720]  and control because now they can own and control all the other viruses and then
[57:52.720 --> 57:56.480]  now claim they have treatments for those it's like owning a disease it's like
[57:56.480 --> 57:59.840]  owning it's like saying if there's 10 companies putting on heart valves and you
[57:59.840 --> 58:04.160]  somehow get the patent to have all 10 heart valves it's it's it's or you you
[58:04.160 --> 58:08.000]  know you've got the patent all you know 10 type of automobiles and now you tell
[58:08.000 --> 58:12.240]  people it you only have one choice so it's a it's a medical takeover a
[58:12.240 --> 58:16.000]  corporate takeover and the original article breaks it down I'm a clinical
[58:16.000 --> 58:21.440]  lab scientist covered is fake wake up America that's from rightsfreedom.org
[58:21.440 --> 58:24.400]  press.com he looked up the doctor it's accurate but that's what all the
[58:24.400 --> 58:29.240]  information shows it doesn't mean there's not a real COVID virus it's just a
[58:29.240 --> 58:32.880]  weaponized cold virus that spreads really easy not much more deadly than any
[58:32.880 --> 58:36.960]  other cold virus but then they can then claim all the other viruses are it have
[58:36.960 --> 58:41.760]  PCR tests then set so you are bad so you've got the new scary thing because
[58:41.760 --> 58:45.800]  folks don't panic it was just a cold or the flu but it's oh COVID now they've
[58:45.800 --> 58:49.080]  got you and then people may have a cold they go in and get intubated and then
[58:49.080 --> 58:52.160]  die the ventilator which they make money off of and jack up the scam here's the
[58:52.160 --> 59:01.400]  report a PhD in virology and immunology I'm a clinical lab scientist and have
[59:01.400 --> 59:07.360]  tested 1500 supposed positive COVID-19 samples collected here in Southern
[59:07.360 --> 59:11.880]  California when my lab team and I did the testing through Koch's postulates and
[59:11.880 --> 59:18.520]  observation under a scanning electron microscope we found no COVID in any of
[59:18.520 --> 59:25.120]  the 1500 samples what we found was that all of the 1500 samples were mostly
[59:25.120 --> 59:31.640]  influenza A and some were influenza B but not a single case of COVID and we
[59:31.640 --> 59:38.320]  did not use the BCS piece the the BS PCR tests that's polymerase chain reaction
[59:38.320 --> 59:42.320]  tests Celia Farber does wonderful journalism on the topic I did videos on
[59:42.320 --> 59:46.640]  this channel for that we then sent the remainder of the samples to Stanford
[59:46.640 --> 59:50.320]  Cornell and a few of the University of California labs and they found the same
[59:50.320 --> 59:56.800]  results as we did no COVID they found influenza A and B all of us then spoke
[59:56.800 --> 1:00:04.040]  to the CDC and asked for viable samples of COVID which CDC said they could not
[1:00:04.040 --> 1:00:09.640]  provide as they did not have any samples we have now come to the firm
[1:00:09.640 --> 1:00:16.520]  conclusion to all our research and lab work that the COVID-19 was imaginary and
[1:00:16.520 --> 1:00:22.400]  fictitious the flu was called COVID and most of the 225,000 dead were dead
[1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:26.360]  through comorbidities such as heart disease cancer flu was called COVID and
[1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:30.240]  most of the 225,000 dead were dead through comorbidities such as heart
[1:00:30.240 --> 1:00:34.560]  disease cancer diabetes emphysema etc then they got the flu which further
[1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:38.720]  weakened their immune systems and they died I have yet to find a single viable
[1:00:38.720 --> 1:00:43.280]  sample of COVID-19 to work with we at the seven universities that did the lab
[1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:49.720]  tests on these 1500 samples are now suing the CDC for COVID-19 fraud the CDC has
[1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:54.120]  yet to send us a single viable isolated purified sample of COVID-19 if they
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:58.760]  can't or won't send us a viable sample I say there is no COVID-19 it is
[1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:03.800]  fictitious the four research papers that do describe the genomic extracts of the
[1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:08.760]  COVID-19 virus never were successful in isolating and purifying the samples all
[1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:15.040]  the four papers written on COVID-19 only describe small bits of RNA which were
[1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:21.720]  only 37 to 40 base pairs long which is not a virus a viral genome is typically
[1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:26.720]  30,000 to 40,000 base pairs with as bad as COVID is supposed to be all over the
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:32.040]  place how come no one in any lab worldwide has ever isolated and purified
[1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:35.520]  this virus in its entirety that's because they never really was there they
[1:01:35.520 --> 1:01:39.120]  never really found the virus all they've ever found a small piece of RNA which
[1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:43.440]  were never identified as the virus anyway so what we're dealing with it's just
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:53.280]  another flu strain every year COVID-19 does not exist and is fictitious the
[1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:58.440]  equation is very simple the mega banks control the media they control big
[1:01:58.440 --> 1:02:04.720]  pharma they control academia they control military industrial complex they
[1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:09.840]  control big tech and everywhere that they have been in control in the third
[1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:15.880]  world they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization it
[1:02:15.880 --> 1:02:20.520]  is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that
[1:02:20.520 --> 1:02:24.680]  promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them so because
[1:02:24.680 --> 1:02:30.160]  they can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside down
[1:02:30.160 --> 1:02:37.320]  and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:41.160]  that threatens their monopoly some control that's why they target info
[1:02:41.160 --> 1:02:45.200]  wars because we understand the key should be to them but the only way our
[1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:50.440]  transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and that video so we double your
[1:02:50.440 --> 1:03:13.160]  efforts for all of this together if you are receiving this transmission you are
[1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:23.160]  the resistance from the info wars dot com studios it's Alex Jones ladies and
[1:03:23.160 --> 1:03:29.480]  gentlemen wow we have got so much incredible news unfolding right now and
[1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:34.680]  despite the globalist through the UN through big tech censoring hundreds of
[1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:39.240]  thousands of medical workers doctors scientists and really having an iron
[1:03:39.240 --> 1:03:43.640]  curtain of deception they're having congressional hearings they're having
[1:03:43.640 --> 1:03:48.080]  state hearings they're having foreign governmental hearings they're having the
[1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:53.840]  who's who of scientific elite the actual chief scientist of major companies
[1:03:53.840 --> 1:04:00.600]  come out and say you cannot make a vaccine for COVID-19 it's the common
[1:04:00.600 --> 1:04:05.000]  cold it's all a fraud that's why three months ago Merck said we had two
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:09.880]  vaccines they do not work you cannot make it there are too many mutations you
[1:04:09.880 --> 1:04:13.600]  can't tell really what it's covered 19 or what isn't the PCR test is a fraud
[1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:18.760]  we're pulling out and Merck is a reckless company that did Gardasil that
[1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:23.880]  sterilizes and kills a lot of people so Darth Vader of the of the big pharma
[1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:32.040]  industry said we're passing on this and now boy is it getting crazy and we know
[1:04:32.040 --> 1:04:38.160]  why let me show you the stat of this news top scientists have now gone public
[1:04:38.160 --> 1:04:42.200]  I'll hit this last but I want to talk about it first heading up a seven
[1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:46.720]  university investigation quote I'm a clinical lab scientist covered 19 is
[1:04:46.720 --> 1:04:54.600]  fake wake up America dr. Derek Knoss incredible and we say it's fake they're
[1:04:54.600 --> 1:04:58.400]  just listing all the other viruses is that to then create total fear and
[1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:02.200]  intubate you and kill you with a ventilator for the common cold or pneumonia
[1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:07.120]  or the flu so let's continue ladies and gentlemen look at this headline great
[1:05:07.120 --> 1:05:12.400]  awakening J&J vaccine top Google trends as CDC halts rollout there's so many
[1:05:12.400 --> 1:05:19.800]  bad effects and deaths totally saving effective nobody ever got hurt is Dr.
[1:05:19.800 --> 1:05:24.040]  Fauci the father of the pandemic an incredible Washington Times article out
[1:05:24.040 --> 1:05:31.040]  just yesterday admitting he will basically ran the Wuhan lab it had
[1:05:31.040 --> 1:05:35.280]  hundreds of groups funding it but his program with Obama continuing under
[1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:39.680]  Trump till he pulled out of it two years before COVID launched about a year into
[1:05:39.680 --> 1:05:43.480]  Trump Trump pulled out of it we showed you those documents last week to his
[1:05:43.480 --> 1:05:47.040]  credit that though that he got back into it by then supporting their damn
[1:05:47.040 --> 1:05:53.320]  vaccine a terrible idea but that's the facts is Dr. Fauci the father of the
[1:05:53.320 --> 1:05:59.440]  pandemic and they go into the main funders where the US government and US
[1:05:59.440 --> 1:06:04.680]  universities and research groups and guess who Han showed the whole shooting
[1:06:04.680 --> 1:06:12.120]  match Anthony Fauci let's go over it the former director of the Centers for
[1:06:12.120 --> 1:06:16.680]  Disease Control Provincial Dr. Robert Redfield believes the SARS-CoV-2 virus
[1:06:16.680 --> 1:06:24.840]  originated from the Wuhan Institute of virology if Dr. Redfield is correct and
[1:06:24.840 --> 1:06:28.160]  he almost certainly is the Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of
[1:06:28.160 --> 1:06:31.680]  Health must assume significant responsibility for a global pandemic
[1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:35.160]  that has killed over half a million Americans kicked tens of millions of
[1:06:35.160 --> 1:06:39.600]  Americans to the unemployment curb and drained trillions of dollars of wealth
[1:06:39.600 --> 1:06:44.560]  from the American economy you're like well what's going on here because he ran
[1:06:44.560 --> 1:06:49.080]  the program of the weaponized gain of function and people say well then if it
[1:06:49.080 --> 1:06:53.040]  isn't that deadly and it false positives everything else then what's the issue
[1:06:53.040 --> 1:06:57.360]  because I've studied it and I looked at it over a year ago and we told you they
[1:06:57.360 --> 1:07:02.080]  made hundreds of variants of this it's a synthetic virus based on a cold virus
[1:07:02.080 --> 1:07:06.480]  with four other viruses including HIV delivery system so it spreads really
[1:07:06.480 --> 1:07:12.280]  faster mucus membrane and then they can simply release that they have frozen
[1:07:12.280 --> 1:07:17.520]  intestines other versions they made that are actually far more deadly I've been
[1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:20.200]  figured out exactly what they're planning or where this goes but these are
[1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:23.840]  the facts and we told you this with the guy that wrote the US biological weapons
[1:07:23.840 --> 1:07:32.040]  law and the chief UN prosecutor and that is Dr. Francis Boyle that's how he was
[1:07:32.040 --> 1:07:34.920]  able to tell you 14 months ago everything has now come out because he
[1:07:34.920 --> 1:07:39.280]  didn't just dream this up he knows all the literature and he has all the
[1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:45.880]  sources so talk about total vindication this is in Daily Caller it's in the
[1:07:45.880 --> 1:07:50.440]  Washington Times but it's mentioned in New York Times articles even Washington
[1:07:50.440 --> 1:07:55.000]  Post articles showing that they can't stop this information coming out and
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:03.800]  Communist China just came out and said it's all our fault we're horrible we
[1:08:03.800 --> 1:08:06.640]  should always stay closed well whenever you hear that you never knows what
[1:08:06.640 --> 1:08:10.360]  Communist China says it's always days after Fauci says it word for word
[1:08:10.360 --> 1:08:16.760]  because Fauci is a Rockefeller Rothschild Gates man and they've been
[1:08:16.760 --> 1:08:20.360]  running this with the Chinese and launch the hit Chinese hysteria launch the
[1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:25.160]  fear release the virus on purpose obviously then use the hysteria to try
[1:08:25.160 --> 1:08:30.160]  to permanently lock us down while China is wide open so the EU's in trouble
[1:08:30.160 --> 1:08:32.440]  Latin America and the authoritarian's are in trouble
[1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:35.680]  African authoritarian's are in trouble Middle Eastern authoritarian's are in
[1:08:35.680 --> 1:08:40.120]  trouble Asian authoritarian's are in trouble North American authoritarian's
[1:08:40.120 --> 1:08:43.400]  are in trouble they released this they do it China works with the globalist
[1:08:43.400 --> 1:08:47.760]  cartel to do it to further shut down the West transfer all the jobs of China or
[1:08:47.760 --> 1:08:53.240]  the globalist own the factories this is all economic cultural warfare and then
[1:08:53.240 --> 1:08:56.160]  it also brings in the population agenda behind it and when you read the
[1:08:56.160 --> 1:08:58.960]  articles they get all that they go man isn't it crazy
[1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:03.200]  Fauci has the background Fauci has the know-how Fauci's the one calling for it
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:08.880]  Fauci's the one running it Facebook inside runs the worldwide UN response to
[1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:15.760]  fact-checking the fact-checking is run out of the Wuhan lab so the UN Facebook
[1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:20.400]  Twitter Google Apple they're all lockstep off word for word how do I know
[1:09:20.400 --> 1:09:23.960]  Fauci's in charge he's been involved running these attacks and bio weapon
[1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:27.200]  attacks against Africa and others since before Gates was even out of college
[1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:30.840]  Gates has worked directly under him Fauci is the guy that actually runs the
[1:09:30.840 --> 1:09:36.200]  operational programs he's been doing it for 40 years at least and his because I
[1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:40.440]  read transcripts his word-for-word stuff a week before a month before a day
[1:09:40.440 --> 1:09:44.400]  before will word-for-word come out of Xi Jinping's dirty mouth and out of the
[1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:50.760]  UN's dirty mouth the WHO's murderous mouth he's in charge he's the one he's
[1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:57.800]  the one he's the one look at him so think about that is dr. Fauci the father of
[1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:01.000]  the pandemic you better damn well-believe because who else is the
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:04.360]  chief advisor that sets up the boards that write the light papers that we've
[1:10:04.360 --> 1:10:10.040]  seen in spars 2025 2028 and the great reset and the and the and the lockstep
[1:10:10.040 --> 1:10:19.040]  and an event 201 Fauci Fauci Fauci Fauci Fauci Faustus and so now that's how
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:22.720]  you get him like this new ATF director help run fast and furious help burn
[1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:26.320]  down Waco lied about it help run Ruby Ridge help run Oklahoma City he could
[1:10:26.320 --> 1:10:30.880]  be destroyed just like that well you better watch out Jones will swat team
[1:10:30.880 --> 1:10:34.880]  you good swat team me Burby don't like Waco I'm not afraid I'm free from you
[1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:40.360]  you monster Congress could destroy him by snapping their fingers the Fauci
[1:10:40.360 --> 1:10:44.400]  could be destroyed by snapping your fingers the Rockefeller operations or
[1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:48.440]  gates could be destroyed by snapping your fingers just snap your fingers find
[1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:53.680]  your manhood hold them out it will destroy them the truth will set us free
[1:10:53.680 --> 1:11:03.880]  the truth will destroy them to stop tearing the truth I'm a clinical lab
[1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:11.560]  scientist COVID-19 is fake wake-up and it continues on from there and here's
[1:11:11.560 --> 1:11:14.960]  Senator Paul let's play a short clip of him it's a powerful five minute video
[1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:21.800]  explaining that Fauci claims oh take the shot you'll be okay which of course then
[1:11:21.800 --> 1:11:26.520]  it does create antibodies for a cold virus but Paul then tries to claim oh
[1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:29.640]  but you'll be okay later I mean Paul's just trying to play along with their
[1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:33.680]  fake paradigm and he's not that type of biological doctor he's an eye doctor he's
[1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:37.480]  smart guy but in the final equation that doesn't matter at least he's pointing
[1:11:37.480 --> 1:11:42.600]  out that thousands of fear monger and a tyrant playing God here it is so these
[1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:47.200]  are almost everything out there's good news this is why I so much think Dr.
[1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:52.760]  Fauci should be voluntarily removed from TV because what he says is such a
[1:11:52.760 --> 1:11:57.720]  disservice and such fear-mongering and almost all of what he says isn't even
[1:11:57.720 --> 1:12:01.720]  matched by the science of his own Institute so really what we need to do
[1:12:01.720 --> 1:12:05.400]  is hear from a lot of different experts and then people need to realize that the
[1:12:05.400 --> 1:12:10.600]  risk factors are different depending on your age what's really happening is the
[1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:14.360]  winter is over so more people are getting signed the older still dying as
[1:12:14.360 --> 1:12:17.520]  they're not getting son because anybody will die without getting son vitamin D3
[1:12:17.520 --> 1:12:22.640]  either from the son or from D3 and doctors now know not to innovate people
[1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:25.560]  because that kills them and they have a regular cold you're not supposed to do
[1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:29.520]  that and people are now taking D3 and taking supplements you see the ads all
[1:12:29.520 --> 1:12:33.240]  over TV the public has figured it out and so that's really screwing up Fauci
[1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:36.720]  and everybody that had the FBI SWAT teaming medical doctors that told
[1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:40.320]  folks take vitamin D and vitamin C they're like no SWAT team them don't let
[1:12:40.320 --> 1:12:44.520]  them one of the truth make sure they die my god no you do not need vitamin C no
[1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:48.240]  vitamins no vitamins vitamins will kill you do not take it you'll be water
[1:12:48.240 --> 1:12:52.360]  food either you'll need oxygen either oxygen poison epic is one of only a

[1:15:16.320 --> 1:15:20.880]  it's at infowards.com it's part two of their undercover footage of one of the
[1:15:20.880 --> 1:15:25.920]  top CNN directors how they help steal the election how they help make Trump
[1:15:25.920 --> 1:15:30.520]  look bad how they help make Biden the fraud look good but nobody's buying and
[1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:34.960]  in big national big national polls I'll actually hit next because this all
[1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:38.760]  dovetails together but this is project Veritas in fact I was just sent this by
[1:15:38.760 --> 1:15:43.280]  James O'Keeffe thank you James for the information and we'll click on it so
[1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:47.920]  we're on James's Twitter and here it is breaking part to CNN director reveals
[1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:52.640]  that network practices art of manipulation close quote that's the art of
[1:15:52.640 --> 1:15:58.800]  lying to change the world for the big global's bankers COVID gang busters with
[1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:04.400]  ratings right which is why we constantly have the death toll on the side it makes
[1:16:04.400 --> 1:16:08.920]  it higher no such thing as unbiased news and they admit they artificially raised
[1:16:08.920 --> 1:16:17.000]  it 90 plus percent which is admitted this is the criminal activity and then the
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:22.840]  highly suggestible believe the lies of believe 200 billion Americans died in
[1:16:22.840 --> 1:16:26.480]  some national polls of Democrats here it is
[1:16:26.480 --> 1:16:31.720]  gang busters are ready for freedom COVID gang busters are ready for freedom
[1:16:31.720 --> 1:16:35.960]  right which is why we constantly have the death toll on the side let's make it
[1:16:35.960 --> 1:16:39.440]  higher like why isn't it high enough you know today like it would make our
[1:16:39.440 --> 1:16:44.920]  point better who's higher here like you're really here is a thing that
[1:16:44.920 --> 1:16:50.920]  gives you to dance if it bleeds leads yeah if it leaves a lead no no one ever
[1:16:50.920 --> 1:16:56.640]  says it those things out loud but it's obvious what you're about to see is so
[1:16:56.640 --> 1:17:03.920]  shocking admissions about COVID its impact the bias and things that we've
[1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:09.200]  all suspected but it's never been able to confirm until now
[1:17:09.200 --> 1:17:16.160]  sad news doesn't do well with ratings you know like if you can get someone in
[1:17:16.160 --> 1:17:22.160]  passion that does really well rated sad news back to back to back doesn't do
[1:17:22.160 --> 1:17:28.040]  really well unless it affects them directly COVID gang busters are ready
[1:17:28.040 --> 1:17:31.800]  for freedom right which is why we constantly have the death toll on the
[1:17:31.800 --> 1:17:36.240]  side which I have a major problem with that we're tallying how many people die
[1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:43.240]  every day because I've even looked at it and be like look at it and be like let's
[1:17:43.240 --> 1:17:46.880]  make it higher like why isn't it high enough you know today like it would make
[1:17:46.880 --> 1:17:50.480]  our point better who's higher and I'm like what am I
[1:17:50.480 --> 1:17:56.320]  that's a problem yeah we're doing that you know like the special red foam ring
[1:17:56.320 --> 1:18:02.640]  yeah and they pick it up and it's like the head of the network being like it's
[1:18:02.640 --> 1:18:06.640]  nothing that you're doing right now that makes me want to stick put the numbers
[1:18:06.640 --> 1:18:10.000]  back up because that's the most
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:14.560]  enticing thing that we have to put it back up so like things like that are
[1:18:14.560 --> 1:18:21.760]  constantly talked about I mean there's no such thing as unbiased me any
[1:18:21.760 --> 1:18:27.200]  reporter on CNN they're actually doing is they're telling the person what to
[1:18:27.200 --> 1:18:35.480]  say it's always like leading them in a direction before they even open and the
[1:18:35.480 --> 1:18:40.960]  only people that we will have on the air for the most part are people that have
[1:18:40.960 --> 1:18:44.320]  proven track record
[1:18:44.320 --> 1:18:51.600]  oh that bombshell reports now been posted info wars dot com under the
[1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:55.520]  live show feed it's also the project veritas dot com and we it was great to
[1:18:55.520 --> 1:19:00.840]  have probably very tough song yesterday they broke part one on the show that's
[1:19:00.840 --> 1:19:03.960]  great to be working with them down on the border as well even that speaking of
[1:19:03.960 --> 1:19:08.080]  that I would shorter is going to be joining us the last half of the third
[1:19:08.080 --> 1:19:11.760]  hour today than Paul Joseph Watson it was a guest rich day I'll be hosting the
[1:19:11.760 --> 1:19:14.800]  fourth hour I'm not going to say when I'm going to the border for obvious
[1:19:14.800 --> 1:19:23.880]  reasons sure people can figure that out but let me just say this I feel really
[1:19:23.880 --> 1:19:26.360]  good about how hard we're working but there's also this paradoxical
[1:19:26.360 --> 1:19:30.720]  frustration that I have hundreds of articles here proving coverage a giant
[1:19:30.720 --> 1:19:34.480]  global takeover their own admissions just today I have documents everywhere I
[1:19:34.480 --> 1:19:39.360]  have human smuggling of underage girls not just pregnant women and children and
[1:19:39.360 --> 1:19:44.480]  babies we have undercover them admitting to law enforcement that was working with
[1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:48.160]  us but speaking to him in Spanish that they're being sent to them that they're
[1:19:48.160 --> 1:19:52.720]  delivered to men we have men stalking us outside saying hey I'm just here to get
[1:19:52.720 --> 1:19:59.800]  women that I cannot I cannot believe that the FBI came out two weeks ago and
[1:19:59.800 --> 1:20:02.960]  said we're waving background checks at the migrant centers and at these
[1:20:02.960 --> 1:20:07.440]  charities and telling them we're going to wave it and then you've got obvious
[1:20:07.440 --> 1:20:11.640]  ms-13 connected people because it's the ms-13 tattoo they've got on them and we
[1:20:11.640 --> 1:20:14.920]  checked the law enforcement sites it's the particular grim reaper that they do
[1:20:14.920 --> 1:20:20.160]  on both arms and legs and they're just everywhere delivering kids babies 14-
[1:20:20.160 --> 1:20:27.880]  year-old girls I mean it makes me feel like a sack of filth that that we've
[1:20:27.880 --> 1:20:31.560]  gotten to this point people watch town hall it's not true well there's AP US
[1:20:31.560 --> 1:20:37.680]  waves FBI checks on caregivers at new migrant facility and they admitted to
[1:20:37.680 --> 1:20:42.080]  our under covers they go oh there's just men that sign up online right do they
[1:20:42.080 --> 1:20:46.320]  do backgrounds no we just hope they're nice and we talked to the 18-year-old
[1:20:46.320 --> 1:20:49.320]  chaperone that's leading all these teenagers and little girls down to age
[1:20:49.320 --> 1:20:56.360]  12 and she just goes yeah I just deliver people of these men mainly men how the
[1:20:56.360 --> 1:21:03.880]  hell does biden think you'll get away with this this is total cuckoo land
[1:21:04.920 --> 1:21:10.080]  meanwhile Biden says he'll give
[1:21:11.760 --> 1:21:20.520]  four months pay leave to anyone that takes care of a migrant that's how it
[1:21:20.520 --> 1:21:23.080]  started 10 years ago in Europe and then next it's you got to move out of your
[1:21:23.080 --> 1:21:27.400]  own house free legal to move in next section eight housing old people are
[1:21:27.400 --> 1:21:30.440]  kicked out I'm serious to put the Islamics in I mean that's what they
[1:21:30.440 --> 1:21:32.560]  said to Europe you're like how do they get away with that we used to watch
[1:21:32.560 --> 1:21:36.360]  Europe that happened and it's like because this is a UN plan because we
[1:21:36.360 --> 1:21:42.040]  put up with it ladies and gentlemen remember a week ago when we caught the
[1:21:42.040 --> 1:21:45.520]  kids getting stuck in the in the Trump people said how did Jones catch this he
[1:21:45.520 --> 1:21:51.000]  must have staged it I mean how do you just catch it I had to leave and catch a
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:54.200]  flight back to Austin like an hour and a half later had to leave they caught two
[1:21:54.200 --> 1:21:57.680]  more truckloads the next hour they were there doing the same damn thing you go
[1:21:57.680 --> 1:22:01.960]  there Owen was live last night he was live yesterday for hours and every 10
[1:22:01.960 --> 1:22:05.880]  minutes of us pulled up every 15 minutes of taxi pulled up every five minutes of
[1:22:05.880 --> 1:22:10.080]  van pulled up it's like a frickin ant hill man it's like you go kick an ant
[1:22:10.080 --> 1:22:14.480]  hill or you go I can't believe there's so many ants crawling around they must
[1:22:14.480 --> 1:22:21.600]  have staged it it looks like Disney World or something there except it's a
[1:22:21.600 --> 1:22:28.480]  nightmare okay that's right immigrants tell a forced prostitution of slavery as
[1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:33.960]  traffic gang is jail 80% of the women Amish International found are raped the
[1:22:33.960 --> 1:22:38.240]  Senate report found the same thing 10,000 children placed by Obama knowingly
[1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:42.160]  with sex traffickers and that was the test and they got away with it and now
[1:22:42.160 --> 1:22:51.160]  the FBI signed on to child trafficking on a giant industrial scale good God stick
[1:22:51.160 --> 1:22:56.440]  a fork in us we're done I mean people ask me are you worried about them getting
[1:22:56.440 --> 1:23:00.280]  you are you worried about the whole damn country's burning down politically am I
[1:23:00.280 --> 1:23:06.600]  worried about them I mean actually I'm not even we're so far gone now I just
[1:23:06.600 --> 1:23:10.480]  have trust in God that things turn around somehow I mean but but but but we'll
[1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:16.240]  follow any orders of the mainstream media out of the left and so it doesn't
[1:23:16.240 --> 1:23:19.120]  matter Biden never even signed an executive order everything being done
[1:23:19.120 --> 1:23:22.040]  now there's illegal an executive order could be challenged in court but
[1:23:22.040 --> 1:23:27.680]  there's not even an order they just say come wave the rules ship kids to adults
[1:23:27.680 --> 1:23:30.760]  little babies being handed off people how do you keep catching this in the
[1:23:30.760 --> 1:23:34.600]  airport if you go to the airport it's like Disney World's entrance except it's
[1:23:34.600 --> 1:23:38.320]  kidnapped women and children a bunch of them being sent to random men and then
[1:23:38.320 --> 1:23:41.520]  random creepers come up doesn't say I'm just here to get women you got a problem
[1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:44.280]  with that I'm taking women back
[1:23:46.920 --> 1:23:52.520]  what had it straight ahead stay with us as negative as times are right now and
[1:23:52.520 --> 1:23:58.200]  as depressing as things can be you have to understand that this is all a test
[1:23:58.200 --> 1:24:06.320]  this experience this wife on this planet is a reckoning it's God giving us a
[1:24:06.320 --> 1:24:10.120]  chance to work things out with third dimension so we can decide where we
[1:24:10.120 --> 1:24:14.200]  want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come
[1:24:14.200 --> 1:24:18.520]  down to that so as saddest things are and as evil as things are look at all
[1:24:18.520 --> 1:24:22.100]  the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our
[1:24:22.100 --> 1:24:27.920]  consciousness God is the author of us having our own will God is the author of
[1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:33.640]  us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing when you look at
[1:24:33.640 --> 1:24:37.520]  mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington DC and
[1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:42.760]  Fauci and the and the mass cult it's all about dominating your free will it's all
[1:24:42.760 --> 1:24:46.200]  about telling you you're dirty you're ugly you're in bad because Satan hates
[1:24:46.200 --> 1:24:50.200]  you because you're made in the image of God the creator of the universe I am a
[1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:55.000]  very humble person but I'm also a bold person and so as bad as things are with
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:57.800]  the globalist attacking humanity with all the terrible things that are
[1:24:57.800 --> 1:25:02.240]  unfolding I want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well
[1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:06.440]  I'm a public figure so I get to see things the Republic doesn't get to see
[1:25:06.440 --> 1:25:11.240]  and let me tell you whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:16.880]  folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry people are really really
[1:25:16.880 --> 1:25:20.960]  awakening the establishment they don't want to go on with the globalist but
[1:25:20.960 --> 1:25:24.880]  they're scared they're looking for leadership well that's where m4 comes

[1:25:37.800 --> 1:25:43.480]  truth and to take the heat that's our job so please keep us on the air so we

[1:26:10.200 --> 1:26:15.360]  legend kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa who they considered to
[1:26:15.360 --> 1:26:20.120]  be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe the Samoan people would drink
[1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:24.600]  kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little

[1:27:21.240 --> 1:27:51.200]  We got burning police stations we got police stations getting
[1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:57.120]  shot up we got giant riots and then when one black man who has been pursued for
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:01.880]  armed robbery charges gets shot in a hysterical event they say it's the evil
[1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:06.320]  white people again trying to kill the black folks it's the attempt of the
[1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:09.280]  elite that are busy bankrupting this country to get us all fighting and
[1:28:09.280 --> 1:28:13.280]  killing each other and it's disgusting and it's out of control I wanted to get
[1:28:13.280 --> 1:28:17.400]  norm patis is a famous criminal lawyer and constitutional lawyer and also does
[1:28:17.400 --> 1:28:22.280]  work for us on the first amendment issue quite a bit on you know he doesn't
[1:28:22.280 --> 1:28:25.480]  know all the facts and this all just happened yesterday so he's going to be
[1:28:25.480 --> 1:28:34.200]  limited on what he talks about with our info wars reporter sam motea but we do
[1:28:34.200 --> 1:28:38.360]  have the charges against him being loud at the capital and then you super
[1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:42.320]  imposed this with code pink of the democrats and the cabin on hearings
[1:28:42.320 --> 1:28:45.840]  that were so violent attacking congress people and elevators I think people
[1:28:45.840 --> 1:28:49.040]  should be charged for that I think people that you know beat up police or
[1:28:49.040 --> 1:28:53.040]  whatever should be charged but I think when the police wave you in we actually
[1:28:53.040 --> 1:29:00.800]  I have footage of all this Sam was waved in and again he is an info wars
[1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:05.960]  reporter he was doing it as an own private citizen when he went in there I
[1:29:05.960 --> 1:29:09.600]  didn't tell him to go in there I didn't know he was going to DC because I told
[1:29:09.600 --> 1:29:12.520]  him to stay here and run the crew but I guess he was so excited he still showed
[1:29:12.520 --> 1:29:15.560]  up that why he wasn't with our main group and it was outside and I was there
[1:29:15.560 --> 1:29:18.400]  trying to people from going in the letter he shot the incredible footage
[1:29:18.400 --> 1:29:21.560]  the poor woman actually that had been killed that's when I learned Sam was
[1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:25.400]  inside and you have footage of the woman being killed because the first time
[1:29:25.400 --> 1:29:30.360]  finally saw proof I was like our crew shot this I was like I had a huge meltdown
[1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:36.320]  they're like hey we got the great footage and I'm like whatever but but when
[1:29:36.320 --> 1:29:38.960]  you got an organization of any size you know the start happening the wheels go
[1:29:38.960 --> 1:29:43.720]  off but regardless Owen has been charged and that is who norm paddice
[1:29:43.720 --> 1:29:48.360]  represents Owen shroyer that's probably the best window into this he was charged
[1:29:48.360 --> 1:29:52.000]  twice one has been dropped once for a silent protest in the capital
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:56.520]  rotunda another for briefly speaking during the impeachment against Nadler in
[1:29:56.520 --> 1:30:01.160]  a pre-impeachment hearing that is still ongoing and it just in the lens of
[1:30:01.160 --> 1:30:06.440]  unweight unjust weights and measures here where Democrats burned down cities
[1:30:06.440 --> 1:30:11.240]  and CNN says well who said protesting needs to be peaceful and you've got it
[1:30:11.240 --> 1:30:15.080]  being praised by Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters but then when people walk between
[1:30:15.080 --> 1:30:20.040]  velvet ropes they're indicted they're kept in jail for months and treated like
[1:30:20.040 --> 1:30:23.400]  terrorists and norm paddice we really appreciate you coming on my friend where
[1:30:23.400 --> 1:30:27.640]  should we tackle this from how should we start peeling this on you I mean it's
[1:30:27.640 --> 1:30:31.960]  you nailed an issue and that is that is does the First Amendment apply equally
[1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:36.120]  and applicably to all I mean we're seeing more signs of quote unquote mostly
[1:30:36.120 --> 1:30:40.920]  peaceful protests in in Minneapolis this time with buildings burning in a police
[1:30:40.920 --> 1:30:46.560]  officer's standing guard I don't see charges for sedition I don't see charges
[1:30:46.560 --> 1:30:50.520]  for conspiracy I don't see charges for seeking to overthrow the Republic or the
[1:30:50.520 --> 1:30:55.200]  order of law but yet on January 6th you know there were events that appeared to
[1:30:55.200 --> 1:31:00.240]  have occurred spontaneously and to this day you know months later apparently
[1:31:00.240 --> 1:31:04.680]  federal authorities are still conducting arrests arrests and doing
[1:31:04.680 --> 1:31:10.080]  invasive searches of people's homes looking for goblins it's it's disturbing
[1:31:10.080 --> 1:31:14.680]  to me I think that the First Amendment is broadly under assault in this country I
[1:31:14.680 --> 1:31:18.640]  think that if you are a member of woke culture you get a pass if you're
[1:31:18.640 --> 1:31:22.320]  advancing the agenda of the people will call it the left I'm not politically
[1:31:22.320 --> 1:31:26.800]  astute if you if you advance a favorite agenda your speed you speak without
[1:31:26.800 --> 1:31:31.440]  consequences but if you use or engage in the similar in similar or even
[1:31:31.440 --> 1:31:36.320]  lead less intrusive expressive conduct suddenly you're charged with a crime and
[1:31:36.320 --> 1:31:40.760]  treated as a felon so you know who's guarding the courthouse doors these days
[1:31:40.760 --> 1:31:46.480]  that's a it's a great question the vice president when she was running for
[1:31:46.480 --> 1:31:50.960]  office before she stole the election she bailed out a bunch of people that were
[1:31:50.960 --> 1:31:55.640]  arrested for serious crimes so she's actually aiding and abetting people that
[1:31:55.640 --> 1:31:59.840]  were burning things down and shooting at people and all of this she endorsed that
[1:31:59.840 --> 1:32:04.440]  but now her Justice Department they admit I'm a target they want me arrested
[1:32:04.440 --> 1:32:08.600]  with absolutely no proof or connection to violence I've decried violence of any
[1:32:08.600 --> 1:32:13.640]  time I'm unaware of any facts that would support and arrest for you but I'd ask
[1:32:13.640 --> 1:32:17.840]  you not to even comment on facts that you're aware of Alex the simple fact of
[1:32:17.840 --> 1:32:21.400]  the matter is that the government can make a suspect of anyone and if they
[1:32:21.400 --> 1:32:25.480]  choose to target you they can troll through the electronic detritus of your
[1:32:25.480 --> 1:32:29.760]  life and find things of that were said in isolated moments that make you look
[1:32:29.760 --> 1:32:34.880]  bad so the stakes are high for you your viewers for mr. Montoya if you speak
[1:32:34.880 --> 1:32:39.000]  against the prevailing orthodoxy right now you can be construed a criminal if
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:43.960]  someone was is within earshot of your speech and they cross a line drawn in
[1:32:43.960 --> 1:32:49.120]  the sand by a federal prosecutor these are extremely terrifying times what I
[1:32:49.120 --> 1:32:53.000]  know in mr. Montoya's case is that he was arrested for his conduct on the
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:56.920]  Capitol that day I understand he had a press pass federal authorities may or
[1:32:56.920 --> 1:33:00.920]  may not be aware of that the press pass may or may not have protected him from
[1:33:00.920 --> 1:33:05.000]  all the consequences of what he was doing that day that's a question that
[1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:09.880]  will have to be sorted out in a court of law you know I represent you obviously
[1:33:09.880 --> 1:33:15.600]  my primary concern is you I do not believe there are facts sufficient to
[1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:21.600]  warrant a further investigation of you or much less than an arrest I'm prepared
[1:33:21.600 --> 1:33:25.960]  to wage that fight when the time comes if it comes in the meantime I will do
[1:33:25.960 --> 1:33:30.320]  everything possible I can to deprive the federal government of the oxygen it
[1:33:30.320 --> 1:33:34.960]  needs to engage in its fantasy land fire with respect to Alex Jones and in full
[1:33:34.960 --> 1:33:38.920]  wars let's talk about this this is just now breaking we know the name of the
[1:33:38.920 --> 1:33:43.720]  female police officer who said get ready taser and then she shot and killed
[1:33:43.720 --> 1:33:48.280]  Dante right he's in the middle of rioting he's got a warrant out for armed
[1:33:48.280 --> 1:33:52.600]  robbery the city's burning the police station shot up he's kicking police
[1:33:52.600 --> 1:33:56.120]  flailing she absolutely shoots him in the fog of war that's what happens I'm
[1:33:56.120 --> 1:33:59.920]  not glad it happened but he's a thug waving guns around on the internet you
[1:33:59.920 --> 1:34:02.920]  know all this he's dead now what does he expect you go right probably gonna get
[1:34:02.920 --> 1:34:08.080]  killed by somebody surprisingly one person got killed so we have all of that
[1:34:08.080 --> 1:34:12.360]  rioting the police station shot up and almost no news of the police station
[1:34:12.360 --> 1:34:17.960]  shot up can you imagine if the people at the January 6th event had just fired
[1:34:17.960 --> 1:34:21.600]  bullets into the Capitol you would never have heard of the end of it but this is
[1:34:21.600 --> 1:34:26.400]  breaking ladies and gentlemen so look Minneapolis is a great case study here
[1:34:26.400 --> 1:34:31.280]  you know I I what my office is watching this young woman's problems and we're
[1:34:31.280 --> 1:34:35.800]  hoping our phone rings we'd love to represent you if you are out there you
[1:34:35.800 --> 1:34:40.200]  know I can't solicit a client but we'll take your call what that's your partner
[1:34:40.200 --> 1:34:45.160]  that's Jim Potter here's the closing argument I'd like to make on Derek
[1:34:45.160 --> 1:34:48.640]  Chauvin's behalf if I were in that courtroom ladies and gentlemen of the
[1:34:48.640 --> 1:34:52.840]  jury the rule of law creates settled expectations for us when we go out in
[1:34:52.840 --> 1:34:57.200]  public minimal conditions of decency there are things were expected to do to
[1:34:57.200 --> 1:35:01.880]  enjoy the benefits of civil society did George Floyd honor his side of the
[1:35:01.880 --> 1:35:06.160]  bargain the day that he died and I think the answer is overwhelmingly he did not
[1:35:06.160 --> 1:35:11.320]  Derek Chauvin responded in response to a call of a counterfeit bill he had every
[1:35:11.320 --> 1:35:15.880]  reason and right and justification to question Mr. Floyd Mr. Floyd resisted at
[1:35:15.880 --> 1:35:18.640]  the get-go he wouldn't put his hands on the wheel he wouldn't get out of the car
[1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:22.400]  he wouldn't comply with requests for directives he was resistant throughout
[1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:26.520]  now not physically and overwhelmingly so but police officers don't have the
[1:35:26.520 --> 1:35:29.840]  obligation to give you a pass just because you're behaving perhaps
[1:35:29.840 --> 1:35:34.480]  intoxicated perhaps psychotic perhaps both police officers have a right to use
[1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:38.680]  reasonable force what should Derek Chauvin and his colleagues have done
[1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:42.200]  should they have engaged in cash and release law enforcement because Floyd
[1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:46.600]  was irrational and perhaps intoxicated if that's long the law enforcement you
[1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:49.960]  want then the streets aren't safe at what point should they have simply
[1:35:49.960 --> 1:35:54.280]  released him and said he's too much trouble I can't breathe he said yes yes
[1:35:54.280 --> 1:35:58.000]  but he said it well before officers put him to the ground he said it when he was
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:01.560]  sitting upright in the car he predicted his own death before he got in the car
[1:36:01.560 --> 1:36:07.160]  put me on the ground and he asked to be placed on the ground the whole world is
[1:36:07.160 --> 1:36:11.880]  watching the George Floyd case correct but only the jury has been forced to see
[1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:15.880]  all 48 minutes of the body camera when you look at the body camera and you
[1:36:15.880 --> 1:36:18.960]  listen candidly and carefully to the medical evidence presented to the jury
[1:36:18.960 --> 1:36:22.640]  I don't think you can watch it he's throwing fentanyl and meth out of his
[1:36:22.640 --> 1:36:26.640]  pockets it's but it's sad I feel sorry he's dead but the cop knew him to was
[1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:29.520]  just trying to control him till they could finally get him to jail we're
[1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:33.800]  gonna come back we got breaking news the DOJ will not pursue criminal charges
[1:36:33.800 --> 1:36:36.880]  against the US Capitol police officer they still three months later not
[1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:40.320]  released his name involved the fatal shooting 35-year-old Ashley Babbitt in
[1:36:40.320 --> 1:36:44.040]  January 6th they will not pursue charges and won't tell us his name
[1:36:44.040 --> 1:36:48.920]  crew star chamber tyranny next level over right back with norm paddice it's
[1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:52.840]  hard to believe that we're already in the middle of April and our borders
[1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:56.520]  collapsing and world governments being announced that Joe Biden's coming after
[1:36:56.520 --> 1:37:00.720]  our guns and trying to start a war with Russia but told China they can take over

[1:40:50.080 --> 1:41:09.920]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show welcome back I'm Alex Jones your host
[1:41:09.920 --> 1:41:14.080]  when I first saw the George Floyd footage of a man on the ground begging I
[1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:17.720]  can't breathe I can't breathe you think that he's killing him with a knee on his
[1:41:17.720 --> 1:41:21.800]  neck it's really mainly on his back but when you watch the 45 minute video which
[1:41:21.800 --> 1:41:26.040]  I've watched twice it's very heart-rending you see a drug addict out of his mind on
[1:41:26.040 --> 1:41:30.160]  speed and are enough fentanyl to kill three men he's begging saying he can't
[1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:33.120]  breathe when he's not even handcuffed he's and then he's on the ground he's
[1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:35.880]  all going crazy he's flipping out that's why people call the police on him
[1:41:35.880 --> 1:41:41.760]  black folks call the police on him and now his family's gotten $27 million now
[1:41:41.760 --> 1:41:45.400]  this other guy's gonna get all this money and it's just all a bunch of drug
[1:41:45.400 --> 1:41:50.720]  addicts running around crazy and the police are like our custodians that are
[1:41:50.720 --> 1:41:54.760]  up cleaning this up and then they get the blame when stuff goes on and the
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:42:00.720]  politicians that have sold the country out they then point at the police and
[1:42:00.720 --> 1:42:04.240]  say that's the government that's the elite get rid of them we'll be safe well
[1:42:04.240 --> 1:42:07.960]  they don't want to get rid of them the dialectic is to get rid of them and then
[1:42:07.960 --> 1:42:10.640]  Senator Kang goes no no we don't want to get rid of them we want to reform them
[1:42:10.640 --> 1:42:14.160]  and have them under our control but if you look at Europe and Canada and
[1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:19.560]  Australia when the left runs the police you better look out because now you are
[1:42:19.560 --> 1:42:22.040]  living under some tyranny and then when the cops kill you they're not gonna be on
[1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:25.800]  the news because it's all part of the same system so they're taking the police
[1:42:25.800 --> 1:42:28.720]  over right now we've got this big development the DOJ will not pursue
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:33.880]  criminal charges there's a capital police officer we killed Ashley Babbit in
[1:42:33.880 --> 1:42:36.880]  cold blood we should roll some footage of that our reporter shot the footage
[1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:42.600]  involved in the fatal shooting of 35 year old Ashley Babbit on January 6th the
[1:42:42.600 --> 1:42:45.040]  Department of Justice closed the investigation the death of Ashley
[1:42:45.040 --> 1:42:51.080]  Babbit and they say since when do you have an investigation like it's national
[1:42:51.080 --> 1:42:56.240]  security like it's the CIA and we don't even they close the investigation we
[1:42:56.240 --> 1:43:01.360]  know the person's name this is a very dangerous precedent here Norm what do
[1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:06.160]  you think is going on here I have no idea I mean and that's the problem it's not
[1:43:06.160 --> 1:43:10.520]  transparent I know that had she been black and there were no charges no
[1:43:10.520 --> 1:43:14.240]  transparency there might be more riots in the streets and then we'd be talking
[1:43:14.240 --> 1:43:18.560]  about the need for a so-called racial reckoning somehow the American public
[1:43:18.560 --> 1:43:22.480]  during the pandemic fell asleep and we've been sold a bill of goods the
[1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:26.880]  George Floyd case had nothing to do with race police office it had everything
[1:43:26.880 --> 1:43:31.280]  to do with police officers responding to an irrational man and making what they
[1:43:31.280 --> 1:43:36.960]  thought what what were split second judgments intense evolving circumstances
[1:43:36.960 --> 1:43:41.680]  that were made maybe not the best judgments but where would the question
[1:43:41.680 --> 1:43:47.040]  is were they reasonable I was stunned by the fact that the Minneapolis police
[1:43:47.040 --> 1:43:52.800]  brass deserted Chauvin on the stand and became a bunch of quizzlings that if
[1:43:52.800 --> 1:43:57.600]  that's not an example of community policing in its pathological form I
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:02.640]  don't know what it is well imagine having to wrestle with a big guy hopped up
[1:44:02.640 --> 1:44:09.000]  on drugs for 30 40 minutes they were they were like they were like nannies or
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:13.720]  something why who would take a job being treated like this and they were
[1:44:13.720 --> 1:44:17.320]  exemplary throughout much of this and there's mr. Floyd I'm not like this I'm
[1:44:17.320 --> 1:44:20.760]  not that kind of guy please please you got to listen to me I'm clusterfobic and
[1:44:20.760 --> 1:44:24.800]  soon he'll go into the car and it'll be the first time that he'll say I can't
[1:44:24.800 --> 1:44:28.800]  breathe and no one's got a hand on him now if you're Derek Chauvin and you're
[1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:32.720]  responsible for this man's welfare you know something's wrong one of his
[1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:36.560]  friends at the scene who was in the car with him made this gesture to the
[1:44:36.560 --> 1:44:39.920]  officers about Floyd when they arrived given again the officers more
[1:44:39.920 --> 1:44:43.480]  information that here's a man whose next movements were unknown because he was
[1:44:43.480 --> 1:44:47.280]  on the erratic and he was erratic throughout so Chauvin's now got his knee
[1:44:47.280 --> 1:44:51.560]  on the man's upper back it looks like it's on its neck from one vantage point
[1:44:51.560 --> 1:44:55.640]  but from another it's on his upper back to subdue him and keep him on the ground
[1:44:55.640 --> 1:44:59.720]  while Floyd is saying what he was saying when he was sat up I can't breathe
[1:44:59.720 --> 1:45:03.520]  you know what I think I think I think officially the police should call the
[1:45:03.520 --> 1:45:06.840]  blood of the Democrats and I think they should officially stand down in major
[1:45:06.840 --> 1:45:10.600]  cities and just say fine we'll be like the teachers union that doesn't work for
[1:45:10.600 --> 1:45:13.480]  a year and let your kids just sit at home I think the police should just walk
[1:45:13.480 --> 1:45:17.400]  off in all let this area is and just have their hands they fine and just let
[1:45:17.400 --> 1:45:22.400]  it all burn everybody just kill each other I'm serious they did that last
[1:45:22.400 --> 1:45:25.640]  summer and then the Democrats won the White House so if this is the law
[1:45:25.640 --> 1:45:29.440]  enforcement we want it's the law enforcement we get but I'll tell you
[1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:33.120]  something if I hear a rustle at the door tonight and somebody's trying to enter
[1:45:33.120 --> 1:45:37.920]  my home I'm calling 911 I'm not calling black lives matter and I don't care
[1:45:37.920 --> 1:45:41.880]  about the color of the person who's my senator Kenny made the point he said you
[1:45:41.880 --> 1:45:44.320]  don't call a crack yeah but somebody's breaking down your door you call the
[1:45:44.320 --> 1:45:48.280]  police that's exactly I'm gonna kiss the police ass because they got some bad
[1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:51.360]  ones and sometimes it goes wrong but as a profession I've watched it I've gone
[1:45:51.360 --> 1:45:56.200]  right along this is a really hard rough job that I would not want for the
[1:45:56.200 --> 1:45:59.680]  money and I would make more mistakes than I was a cop I mean these are the stuff
[1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:05.040]  they put up with is just hellish I spent several decades engaged in day-to-day
[1:46:05.040 --> 1:46:09.200]  litigation with cops many involving death of a people being arrested many
[1:46:09.200 --> 1:46:14.800]  claims of unreasonable force I've tried scores of these cases what police
[1:46:14.800 --> 1:46:20.760]  officers do is ordinary heroism the two most difficult calls that a police
[1:46:20.760 --> 1:46:24.640]  officer makes are a response to a domestic call and a response to a person
[1:46:24.640 --> 1:46:28.800]  in a car and the reason in both instances is you really don't know what
[1:46:28.800 --> 1:46:33.080]  you're doing exactly it's Russian and let it here's the thing you work for
[1:46:33.080 --> 1:46:36.200]  carpet cleaning place for only three months and it made me think about cops
[1:46:36.200 --> 1:46:40.800]  when I was in college some of these houses were filthy evil kids in bad
[1:46:40.800 --> 1:46:45.880]  positions drug paraphernalia for fleas cops got to go into that all day long
[1:46:45.880 --> 1:46:49.960]  man I mean you imagine this is like they got to take care of all these crazy
[1:46:49.960 --> 1:46:54.160]  homeless all of it and we just crap on them what why do you think the left's
[1:46:54.160 --> 1:46:58.520]  doing that I think there's a broader we've talked about this before I think
[1:46:58.520 --> 1:47:01.760]  there's a broader crisis of legitimacy in the country I don't think that we have
[1:47:01.760 --> 1:47:05.920]  a common consensus about values or the norms or what the republic stands for
[1:47:05.920 --> 1:47:08.800]  you look at what's happened at the New York Times you know one of its editors
[1:47:08.800 --> 1:47:12.440]  is captured the nation they're part of the nation's imagination with the so-called
[1:47:12.440 --> 1:47:18.200]  1619 project her reading of our history is that it is one solid story of racial
[1:47:18.200 --> 1:47:22.480]  repression and that it needs to be righted now in the name of social and
[1:47:22.480 --> 1:47:26.600]  racial justice therefore when a police officer arrests a black man it has
[1:47:26.600 --> 1:47:30.400]  nothing to do necessarily with the black man's conduct but the context in which
[1:47:30.400 --> 1:47:33.840]  the conduct arose well I mean now the black lives matter lady that their own
[1:47:33.840 --> 1:47:37.840]  people are calling for investigation looks like in bezel tens of millions 10.6
[1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:41.000]  billion given the black lives matter causes last year she's calling it white
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:45.360]  supremacism to investigate I mean no you move into all white neighborhoods you
[1:47:45.360 --> 1:47:48.960]  have a private airfield turns out you've got like six houses tens of millions of
[1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:54.760]  dollars you're and as she said I'm a supremacy if she shows free white
[1:47:54.760 --> 1:47:58.360]  supremacy why are all her houses in the most white neighborhoods I've ever heard
[1:47:58.360 --> 1:48:03.560]  of because she's trying to recolonize the continent that was stolen from Native
[1:48:03.560 --> 1:48:07.360]  Americans and to disconfit her neighbors by showing that we're here and we
[1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:11.400]  matter the money that you used to buy your house was stolen from people of
[1:48:11.400 --> 1:48:15.240]  color so I may have stolen this money from my contributors that doesn't make me
[1:48:15.240 --> 1:48:19.200]  guilty it just makes me a different kind of thief and because my life matters and
[1:48:19.200 --> 1:48:23.520]  the context of injustice is such that I've been disadvantaged from birth I
[1:48:23.520 --> 1:48:27.880]  get a pass these days and so with respect to George Floyd when he was
[1:48:27.880 --> 1:48:31.800]  called to the scene for counter you know on the claim of a counterfeit 20 from
[1:48:31.800 --> 1:48:34.920]  her perspective they probably should have given him a 20 for his troubles and
[1:48:34.920 --> 1:48:39.240]  sent him on his way I look at it who calls the cops this is a black shop they
[1:48:39.240 --> 1:48:42.600]  call it on him he's out of his mind and then they're all bitching and saying
[1:48:42.600 --> 1:48:45.640]  Floyd's debt is wrong they're joining the bandwagon as far as I'm concerned they
[1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:50.920]  killed him let's look at this here's what we know about Kim Potter a 20-something
[1:48:50.920 --> 1:48:54.440]  year police officer a shooting trainer she made a mistake she should probably
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:58.840]  you know getting big trouble for but not in died she says taser she pulls the
[1:48:58.840 --> 1:49:02.680]  wrong weapon obviously she doesn't have a motive to kill a black guy in the
[1:49:02.680 --> 1:49:06.960]  middle of this obviously she knows why would you make a mistake like this how
[1:49:06.960 --> 1:49:10.680]  do you put her in a position like this and then when she makes a mistake you
[1:49:10.680 --> 1:49:14.600]  say she does it on purpose and now they want her in prison but we know her name
[1:49:14.600 --> 1:49:19.560]  less than a day after it happens and she's gone a day after it happens but
[1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:22.880]  then we don't know the name of the black man that killed the white woman that
[1:49:22.880 --> 1:49:26.840]  shows you the double standard it's dangerous it's truly dangerous chief
[1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:30.320]  justice John Roberts put it well in a case involving school district in
[1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:35.200]  Seattle the only way to end discrimination on the basis of races to
[1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:39.520]  stop discriminating on the basis of race and right now there is a presumption
[1:49:39.520 --> 1:49:45.320]  you know that if you're white you ain't quite right you know I I I tried my
[1:49:45.320 --> 1:49:49.680]  debut at stand-up comedy the other night at a small club in Connecticut and I
[1:49:49.680 --> 1:49:54.280]  ended my riff with the following hey you know I tried to buy woke insurance the
[1:49:54.280 --> 1:49:58.240]  other day the crowd looked at me what's woke insurance well woke insurance is
[1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:00.720]  what you need if you're a white man because I'm reading the paper and
[1:50:00.720 --> 1:50:04.120]  everything in that's wrong with this country is my fault how am I gonna pay
[1:50:04.120 --> 1:50:08.680]  for all of this I need woke insurance and we're at a point where you know that
[1:50:08.680 --> 1:50:14.000]  sort of humor it isn't necessarily farcical any longer there is a double
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  standard with respect to the identity of the Capitol shooter I don't know that

[1:52:45.680 --> 1:52:49.880]  being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people
[1:52:49.880 --> 1:52:54.400]  I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year okay I'm a double amputee and I
[1:52:54.400 --> 1:52:59.840]  have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away living defense saved
[1:52:59.840 --> 1:53:04.840]  my life they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living
[1:53:04.840 --> 1:53:10.200]  defense brought me back I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as
[1:53:10.200 --> 1:53:15.840]  to where we are right now this is Matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you
[1:53:15.840 --> 1:53:22.240]  up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for
[1:53:22.240 --> 1:53:27.400]  my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and
[1:53:27.400 --> 1:53:31.400]  shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother and that's because
[1:53:31.400 --> 1:53:34.960]  God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and
[1:53:34.960 --> 1:53:40.160]  that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country
[1:53:40.160 --> 1:53:47.600]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:52.600 --> 1:54:03.520]  you look like an angel walk like an angel talk like an angel
[1:54:03.520 --> 1:54:12.360]  all right norm paddock's constitutional lawyer famous criminal lawyer is here
[1:54:12.360 --> 1:54:18.400]  with us and I was asking during the break how do you know less than six
[1:54:18.400 --> 1:54:24.520]  hours after Dante Wright is shot and killed when they're out after him on an
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:28.960]  arm robbery warrant and the woman says taser taser during the fight and
[1:54:28.960 --> 1:54:31.600]  obviously during the adrenaline pulls the wrong weapon that's happened quite a
[1:54:31.600 --> 1:54:34.960]  bit as part of the training why would you want to destroy yourself why would
[1:54:34.960 --> 1:54:38.440]  you want to go to prison it's still sad that he died but he's the one out waving
[1:54:38.440 --> 1:54:41.400]  guns around you know the warrant and all the rest of it during riots and I'm
[1:54:41.400 --> 1:54:45.880]  surprised more weren't killed I'm still not saying I'm happy about it but we
[1:54:45.880 --> 1:54:51.320]  know Kim Potter the veteran police officer's name very very quickly now the
[1:54:51.320 --> 1:54:54.600]  country's burning you know in the middle of the nation and on the west coast and
[1:54:54.600 --> 1:54:59.040]  they say of the officer in the chauvin trial is found not guilty despite what
[1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:03.320]  the jury you know seen that the whole country will burn because you know this
[1:55:03.320 --> 1:55:08.360]  is more injustice so I was asking norm paddock's what do we do when the DOJ just
[1:55:08.360 --> 1:55:12.960]  minutes ago said they closed the case in the investigation of death of Ashley
[1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:18.000]  Babbitt on video that our own reporter it was out freelancing but he got the
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:22.260]  footage we should roll some of that Sam shot this he was just arrested by the
[1:55:22.260 --> 1:55:26.920]  FBI yesterday talking about crazy at the epicenter of everything info wars and
[1:55:26.920 --> 1:55:31.920]  they are saying we're not going to tell you the name this was three months ago
[1:55:31.920 --> 1:55:36.880]  plus I don't know we're in law we're in anywhere you can do this this is really
[1:55:36.880 --> 1:55:40.360]  a dangerous present you got a black guy killing a white woman we don't ever know
[1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:43.800]  his name you got a white woman killing a black guy we know in six hours what's
[1:55:43.800 --> 1:55:48.160]  going on here norm well so with respect to what how the government gets to keep
[1:55:48.160 --> 1:55:52.320]  secrets there is something known as the law enforcement privilege so while an
[1:55:52.320 --> 1:55:56.120]  investigation is pending the government can keep secrets and the theory is that
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:56:00.280]  public distribution or broadcast of its investigative efforts could prejudice
[1:56:00.280 --> 1:56:05.760]  the investigation however what the DOJ did today is hugely significant by
[1:56:05.760 --> 1:56:10.120]  closing the investigation they closed the door on an exception to a public
[1:56:10.120 --> 1:56:15.080]  records request so there's a very good argument to be made that anybody who
[1:56:15.080 --> 1:56:19.360]  wants to can file a freedom of information request for the investigative
[1:56:19.360 --> 1:56:23.000]  package they cannot claim and that would include the identity of the shooter
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:27.360]  they cannot claim that this would be subject to a law enforcement privilege
[1:56:27.360 --> 1:56:31.840]  because they just told us the the case is closed so they may come up with a
[1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:35.920]  different excuse a different claim but I think they'd have to make it right now
[1:56:35.920 --> 1:56:39.080]  as far as I'm concerned that's a public record and the public has a right to
[1:56:39.080 --> 1:56:45.640]  know but again they instantly released it in hours if it's a white person
[1:56:45.640 --> 1:56:49.160]  shooting a black person but they won't when it's a black person shooting a white
[1:56:49.160 --> 1:56:52.640]  person just like this NFL guy in Georgia that killed the six people that were
[1:56:52.640 --> 1:56:56.320]  white and some type of racial attack they won't even cover it the news it's
[1:56:56.320 --> 1:57:01.440]  it's weird what do you think the point of that is here well I people like to say
[1:57:01.440 --> 1:57:05.040]  that the Constitution is chiseled in grant that its guarantees are crystal
[1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:09.720]  clear for all to see and that's simply not true the Constitution is written on
[1:57:09.720 --> 1:57:13.640]  silly putty and that meet its meaning in the terms such as due process or
[1:57:13.640 --> 1:57:18.520]  reasonableness gets stretched based on the community consensus on values right
[1:57:18.520 --> 1:57:22.080]  if you buy into the notion that there's a racial reckoning and that people of
[1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:25.960]  color or owed something because of historic injustice then of course the
[1:57:25.960 --> 1:57:29.200]  door is going to swing one way I'm tutoring a young law student in
[1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:32.160]  constitutional law at an elite university I'm not going to name the
[1:57:32.160 --> 1:57:36.320]  student or the university but he showed me his textbook and it talked about the
[1:57:36.320 --> 1:57:41.360]  difference between malign or bad at discrimination and benign or good at
[1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:45.560]  discrimination so law students are being taught that it's okay to treat people
[1:57:45.560 --> 1:57:49.280]  differently on the basis of their characteristics is and so that people
[1:57:49.280 --> 1:57:53.880]  belong to one class get some gets get one level of benefits people belonging to
[1:57:53.880 --> 1:57:57.320]  another get a different level it's just wrong now I heard you say before the
[1:57:57.320 --> 1:58:01.320]  break what can we do to change it I ask your listeners to go to the Gospel of
[1:58:01.320 --> 1:58:06.480]  John chapter 5 and that's the story of the the sick man at Bethesda Jesus went
[1:58:06.480 --> 1:58:10.000]  to the fountain there was a man laying beside the fountain he was ill when the
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:13.760]  waters would rise it's waters where they were he they had healing power he was
[1:58:13.760 --> 1:58:16.880]  begging for somebody to move him so that he could be touched by the water and
[1:58:16.880 --> 1:58:20.560]  Jesus said why are you here I want to be into the waters he said but every time
[1:58:20.560 --> 1:58:23.880]  the waters move others beat me there Jesus looked at the man and he didn't
[1:58:23.880 --> 1:58:28.280]  create an affirmative action plan he didn't create a program for a racial or
[1:58:28.280 --> 1:58:31.840]  disabled reckoning he looked at the man and said words that I don't think we
[1:58:31.840 --> 1:58:38.640]  say often enough to one another pick up your bed and walk and the man did he had
[1:58:38.640 --> 1:58:42.440]  the power within himself to take care of his own situation as I believe we all
[1:58:42.440 --> 1:58:45.920]  do so my view is the next time somebody asked you for something on a counter
[1:58:45.920 --> 1:58:50.200]  skin color tell them John 5 8 and
[1:58:51.240 --> 1:58:55.400]  granny do right granny do right thanks for holding her on the air go ahead
[1:58:55.400 --> 1:59:00.840]  challenge first of all let me say I love your products I am a granny and for all
[1:59:00.840 --> 1:59:04.800]  the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like
[1:59:04.800 --> 1:59:09.600]  me I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but
[1:59:09.600 --> 1:59:14.120]  since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really
[1:59:14.120 --> 1:59:20.200]  gorgeous actually people think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your
[1:59:20.200 --> 1:59:23.880]  other supplements but I thought you know well maybe that's what I need to do
[1:59:23.880 --> 1:59:27.320]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation but when I started
[1:59:27.320 --> 1:59:31.960]  taking it me doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period of time I
[1:59:31.960 --> 1:59:36.320]  started noticing okay you know this is a ticket this is working this is
[1:59:36.320 --> 1:59:41.720]  wonderful you know I don't I don't have to put on derma blend anymore you know so
[1:59:41.720 --> 1:59:48.080]  anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin
[1:59:58.000 --> 2:00:05.880]  live raw and unfiltered by globalist propaganda it's the Alex Jones show
[2:00:05.880 --> 2:00:16.680]  tomorrow's news today you know the name of the Capitol shooter that killed the
[2:00:16.680 --> 2:00:21.600]  poor woman Ashley Babbitt three plus months ago in January 6 has been known
[2:00:21.600 --> 2:00:25.840]  for a while when the name came out and his Facebook got exposed he took his
[2:00:25.840 --> 2:00:30.420]  Facebook down they did not deny that he was the black officer that shot the
[2:00:30.420 --> 2:00:35.280]  white honorably discharged Air Force veteran Ashley Babbitt to death in cold
[2:00:35.280 --> 2:00:39.800]  blood now I don't wish any harm upon him and and I you know I think that this
[2:00:39.800 --> 2:00:44.840]  investigation has been done and I think it's very very questionable I think that
[2:00:44.840 --> 2:00:49.520]  if it was a white cop shooting a black woman who was breaking through a window
[2:00:49.520 --> 2:00:54.640]  at the Capitol that the US would be burned to a crisp right now I think if we
[2:00:54.640 --> 2:00:59.360]  had footage of a black woman looking like a fish out of water groping for life
[2:00:59.360 --> 2:01:07.320]  as blood pours out of her face that that would happen because the media would
[2:01:07.320 --> 2:01:11.520]  make a big deal about it I'd say it's a heat of battle it's out of control the
[2:01:11.520 --> 2:01:15.280]  officer was scared he was working for Nancy Pelosi and Chuck E. Schumer he'd
[2:01:15.280 --> 2:01:18.920]  been ordered to hold people at that line and lot not let him come any further
[2:01:18.920 --> 2:01:22.160]  because the vice president was in there and though he probably was wrong and
[2:01:22.160 --> 2:01:25.680]  should have just hit her in the head with a club or something you can't
[2:01:25.680 --> 2:01:31.080]  charge him because the heat about that's how common sense works and maybe I'm
[2:01:31.080 --> 2:01:34.000]  being too lenient maybe you disagree that's your right as an American but I
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:37.840]  know this the officer that shot her I don't care if he's black or white or
[2:01:37.840 --> 2:01:42.960]  polka dotted we deserve to know their name and we do know the reported name
[2:01:42.960 --> 2:01:47.160]  I'll show it to you next segment but if you're a TV viewer you're watching the
[2:01:47.160 --> 2:01:51.720]  footage that our own reporter who was arrested by the FBI shot yesterday and
[2:01:51.720 --> 2:01:57.560]  he went in and got incredible footage of my response to that is on info wars
[2:01:57.560 --> 2:02:04.080]  calm and there is a lot of news articles about it today we'll be covering
[2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:07.120]  some of the latest articles also next segment is it's bigger than just info
[2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:12.000]  wars it's about freedom of the press so we all saw that terrible footage of
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:17.600]  George Floyd overdosing cops me on his back look like was on the neck I said
[2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:22.720]  this is terrible fire that cop arresting then I learned more that he worked
[2:02:22.720 --> 2:02:26.560]  with them they were friends George was known to be in porn a bunch of stuff
[2:02:26.560 --> 2:02:29.640]  they were bouncers together and then George sort of getting out of control
[2:02:29.640 --> 2:02:34.200]  black folks called the police on him and it all went wrong does the cop need
[2:02:34.200 --> 2:02:37.880]  more training maybe he was wrong maybe he's fired I don't know but does he get
[2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:43.360]  put in prison the answer is no do you watch this footage does the black cop
[2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:47.640]  that shot this woman dead because she was screaming and yelling and breaking
[2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:51.880]  through the deal he'd been told under orders you stop who comes through there
[2:02:51.880 --> 2:02:58.080]  does he get charged probably not because there was hysteria just like there was
[2:02:58.080 --> 2:03:03.240]  with Kim Potter and the armed robber suspect who've been waving guns around
[2:03:03.240 --> 2:03:07.440]  in a high-speed chase hearing the city burning with riots and they're fighting
[2:03:07.440 --> 2:03:11.480]  and he's kicking and they're grabbing and she says taser taser and pulls the
[2:03:11.480 --> 2:03:18.800]  wrong gun and shoots him like anybody would do if you had that job you might
[2:03:18.800 --> 2:03:22.520]  end up getting that in your own life for 20 something years on the force it
[2:03:22.520 --> 2:03:25.800]  might happen the first week on this force it might happen five years in ten
[2:03:25.800 --> 2:03:32.320]  years in 25 years in like her or it may never happen but you look at motive she
[2:03:32.320 --> 2:03:38.440]  got called he done the armed robbery he was resisting it was hysteria it wasn't
[2:03:38.440 --> 2:03:45.920]  premeditated and you know mess around find out you're not gonna see me dress
[2:03:45.920 --> 2:03:50.920]  like a thug waving guns around armed robbing people because that's how you
[2:03:50.920 --> 2:04:00.880]  get killed that's how you die and I'm sad this young fool is dead but the whole
[2:04:00.880 --> 2:04:03.920]  point is the globalist are robbing the country they're euthanized as their
[2:04:03.920 --> 2:04:06.640]  poisonous with tainted vaccines they're getting rid of the dollar they're
[2:04:06.640 --> 2:04:09.480]  bringing in world government they're chemtrailing everybody and they're
[2:04:09.480 --> 2:04:14.560]  dividing and conquering us and the truth is 14 black men die a year on average
[2:04:14.560 --> 2:04:18.880]  in questionable circumstances and every time they do perfectly right in the
[2:04:18.880 --> 2:04:22.520]  middle of this trial boy you hear all about how important he is and how great
[2:04:22.520 --> 2:04:25.960]  he is and everybody says they're so sad including the fake president and the
[2:04:25.960 --> 2:04:29.280]  fake vice president but when thousands of black men kill each other in
[2:04:29.280 --> 2:04:35.600]  Chicago in New York and DC and all these other places you don't hear a damn
[2:04:35.600 --> 2:04:39.640]  thing about it because the New World Order doesn't care about anybody's lies
[2:04:39.640 --> 2:04:46.280]  in fact they like to get rid of people and that's the reality but it blows me
[2:04:46.280 --> 2:04:54.000]  away to watch that footage that our own reporter was arrested for filming the
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:57.920]  National Geographic was in there and they weren't arrested the CNN was in there
[2:04:57.920 --> 2:05:03.680]  they weren't arrested paying the guy saying burn that mother ever down 35
[2:05:03.680 --> 2:05:10.720]  thousand dollars another agency pep another 35 no problem there no calls
[2:05:10.720 --> 2:05:14.920]  by the left to arrest CNN or National Geographic I don't think they should be
[2:05:14.920 --> 2:05:18.320]  arrested for covering and I think they should be arrested for obviously paying
[2:05:18.320 --> 2:05:22.520]  someone and saying go in there and do this that's why Jaden net is on tape with
[2:05:22.520 --> 2:05:26.160]  the CNN undercover he's with the one I told you was coming I told you we're
[2:05:26.160 --> 2:05:30.240]  gonna pull this off because he'd been online calling for it for weeks and in
[2:05:30.240 --> 2:05:35.760]  person calling for it that day on video but he was released in one day from
[2:05:35.760 --> 2:05:44.560]  jail how long will our reporter be kept yeah there is our own footage of Jade
[2:05:44.560 --> 2:05:53.920]  next obviously messed out of his brain according to his girlfriend that's our
[2:05:53.920 --> 2:06:01.240]  footage that's why I told Sam I told Harrison to stay here I need more crew
[2:06:01.240 --> 2:06:04.600]  to stay here we can't take the whole crew those Harrison did stay here and I'm
[2:06:04.600 --> 2:06:08.200]  like once I learned Sam had shot this footage I'm like well I'm mad that he
[2:06:08.200 --> 2:06:11.520]  came up here without me knowing about it but I guess he told do he was coming but
[2:06:11.520 --> 2:06:15.760]  I was like wow that's amazing footage but I was just like this is surreal this is
[2:06:15.760 --> 2:06:19.720]  this is this is so bizarre I mean I don't like looking at that AC footage for
[2:06:19.720 --> 2:06:23.560]  TV viewers you're seeing it right now and you got Jade next who not once but
[2:06:23.560 --> 2:06:27.560]  twice is calling for burning the mother ever down but because he's a good little
[2:06:27.560 --> 2:06:32.440]  anti-faggot he's being left alone he's being protected but people that simply
[2:06:32.440 --> 2:06:36.200]  strolled into those hallways waved him by police three months later they're
[2:06:36.200 --> 2:06:41.640]  still in jail being beaten up because they're white and that's come out in the
[2:06:41.640 --> 2:06:51.240]  news simply insane so when we come back I think it's our moral responsibility to
[2:06:51.240 --> 2:06:55.520]  release the name as best we know the man is a Capitol Police officer if he's not
[2:06:55.520 --> 2:06:59.160]  the officer that did it that's fine they can contact us and let us know but it
[2:06:59.160 --> 2:07:03.240]  came out you know that the internet believed they knew who it was and the
[2:07:03.240 --> 2:07:07.080]  name and the information and so I believe the public has a right to know
[2:07:07.080 --> 2:07:10.620]  not to go after this officer no one should go after the officer did this no
[2:07:10.620 --> 2:07:15.560]  one should go after Kim Potter they were in the fog of war in a crazy
[2:07:15.560 --> 2:07:20.160]  situation and they were told hold this door and a bunch of people are crashing
[2:07:20.160 --> 2:07:22.920]  through it breaking through it he had about 20 police right behind it with
[2:07:22.920 --> 2:07:26.720]  machine guns didn't stop them and I mean you know you see me I don't just talk
[2:07:26.720 --> 2:07:29.600]  to talk I want to stop that smuggler car I jumped in front of it and we stopped
[2:07:29.600 --> 2:07:33.920]  them I would have you know she's breaking through there I don't I was told to stop
[2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:37.240]  people coming through she was being violent she did her be shot the chest
[2:07:37.240 --> 2:07:40.240]  and I I don't walk right up and hit her with a billy club right square in the
[2:07:40.240 --> 2:07:44.640]  face but instead the police officer let's show our video from the start HD he
[2:07:44.640 --> 2:07:49.840]  takes careful aim and kills her okay that's what he did and the grand jury
[2:07:49.840 --> 2:07:55.520]  didn't indict him so whatever all I know is we know every white cop that kills a
[2:07:55.520 --> 2:07:59.840]  black person's name but when a black person kills a white person we don't
[2:07:59.840 --> 2:08:03.920]  hear about it because the media wants to act like it's only white people killing
[2:08:03.920 --> 2:08:08.360]  black people and that's not true it's 10 to 1 black people killing white people
[2:08:08.360 --> 2:08:12.960]  12 to 1 black people killing white people and I'm sick of hearing how I'm this
[2:08:12.960 --> 2:08:17.120]  evil devil criminal that show up to kill black people when it's the other way
[2:08:17.120 --> 2:08:22.440]  around and by the way I don't blame black people for what a minority of black
[2:08:22.440 --> 2:08:27.240]  people do it's still a small minority that's doing it but that ladies and
[2:08:27.240 --> 2:08:33.160]  gentlemen is the reality and so that system doesn't want this known the
[2:08:33.160 --> 2:08:37.080]  system doesn't want this scene and we need to see it and we need to know it
[2:08:37.080 --> 2:08:41.120]  now I don't think that Kim Potter needs to go to jail for this and I don't think
[2:08:41.120 --> 2:08:44.840]  the police officer at the Capitol needs to go to jail because of the hysteria the
[2:08:44.840 --> 2:08:48.320]  fog of war and the orders he was given those that gave the order to shoot to
[2:08:48.320 --> 2:08:51.560]  kill they should be investigated because they gave the order and I'm not
[2:08:51.560 --> 2:08:56.000]  giving him a Nuremberg defense that he followed orders it's the hysteria a lot
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:59.840]  of people would have done the same thing a lot of white cops had done the same
[2:08:59.840 --> 2:09:02.240]  thing and they were ordered to and the vice presidents right there behind them
[2:09:02.240 --> 2:09:05.800]  and you know right there and they've gotten right to the point but then you
[2:09:05.800 --> 2:09:12.960]  cannot you cannot sit there and then say target all the other cops in other
[2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:18.360]  situations of the summer Dante right writers burned down police building and
[2:09:18.360 --> 2:09:24.400]  fourth cop Kimberly Potter to flee her home after address leaked so see the
[2:09:24.400 --> 2:09:29.440]  left is gonna do all that because because that's what the liberal police
[2:09:29.440 --> 2:09:34.640]  chief did so we asked though why of your white are you immediately known of
[2:09:34.640 --> 2:09:41.200]  your black you're not that's the big question and so we're gonna release the
[2:09:41.200 --> 2:09:45.320]  purported name that the Internet is saying is the officer he is a
[2:09:45.320 --> 2:09:51.120]  Capitol Police officer epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that
[2:09:51.120 --> 2:09:56.040]  promote free speech and freedom of association and they know that big tech
[2:09:56.040 --> 2:09:59.880]  is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive
[2:09:59.880 --> 2:10:03.120]  censorship and organized crime racketeering that's why they've been
[2:10:03.120 --> 2:10:07.120]  massively expanding their services so whether you have domains or want to
[2:10:07.120 --> 2:10:10.760]  register a domain or what help building a website or want servers or any other
[2:10:10.760 --> 2:10:15.080]  major service they've got it all and they're expanding and if you go to info
[2:10:15.080 --> 2:10:19.940]  wars domains dot com and follow that link you get all their services at the
[2:10:19.940 --> 2:10:25.720]  lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes
[2:10:25.720 --> 2:10:30.280]  to fund the info war and we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type
[2:10:30.280 --> 2:10:34.840]  of services that you get from them so it's a win-win as we build a true open
[2:10:34.840 --> 2:10:38.040]  free Internet again because the globalists are destroying what was open
[2:10:38.040 --> 2:10:43.720]  to what was free so info wars domains dot com the revolution starts there info
[2:10:43.720 --> 2:10:48.960]  wars domains dot com take action now I'm gonna say it again I am not lecturing

[2:11:49.680 --> 2:12:05.000]  listening to the alex jones show so when a white police officer or Hispanic
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  police officer shoots a white person a black person a whatever person it's
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:15.280]  instantly on the news every time but when a black man shoots a white man or a
[2:12:15.280 --> 2:12:20.240]  white woman it's never on the news because only whites do bad things you've
[2:12:20.240 --> 2:12:23.560]  heard we're evil so our intent exposing this is you should not to say black
[2:12:23.560 --> 2:12:26.920]  people are inherently bad or that what one black person does reflects on others
[2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:31.840]  it's just we're gonna be fair here so Tyler Hanson's been a pretty good
[2:12:31.840 --> 2:12:35.240]  investigative journalist over the years and he's been on the show before and he
[2:12:35.240 --> 2:12:39.800]  and others say they have the identity of Ashley Babbitt shooter which in the
[2:12:39.800 --> 2:12:43.480]  three-plus months the feds never released and now they quote cleared the police
[2:12:43.480 --> 2:12:47.200]  officer without saying his name of it you don't normally see that do you like
[2:12:47.200 --> 2:12:49.920]  some citizens shoot somebody in their backyard later you hear they were in
[2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:53.560]  diner they were clear but you heard their name day one so is he in the new
[2:12:53.560 --> 2:12:57.120]  royalty now now maybe he's not the officer but for months his name has been
[2:12:57.120 --> 2:13:01.800]  known so if he's not the officer let us know and or we're gonna do a foyer I
[2:13:01.800 --> 2:13:07.640]  assure you I think I've asked my lawyer to do it to find out exactly what's
[2:13:07.640 --> 2:13:10.440]  happening because we have a right as the press a right to know the identity of
[2:13:10.440 --> 2:13:15.320]  Ashley Babbitt shooter is Lieutenant Michael Leroy Byrd says Taylor Hanson
[2:13:15.320 --> 2:13:20.840]  on Twitter multiple mainstream media outlets have known this but refuse to
[2:13:20.840 --> 2:13:27.000]  run the story why is that and he was videotaped and photographed that day
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  being involved with firearms in the building and all the rest of it he's
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:37.560]  also known as leaving his firearm in a capital visitor center bathroom there's
[2:13:37.560 --> 2:13:40.960]  an article on that from roll call capital police weapon weapon attended in
[2:13:40.960 --> 2:13:46.760]  capital bathroom again but it says it's okay because well it's just as okay
[2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:52.280]  Capitol Hill grappling with DC crime spy and he's in an article about that in
[2:13:52.280 --> 2:13:59.200]  roll call as well we again they won't say his name his reported name but again
[2:13:59.200 --> 2:14:02.560]  we do know Kim Potter's name as he said to evacuate her house and the police
[2:14:02.560 --> 2:14:06.120]  station's been burned down but that's okay because she's a white devil and she
[2:14:06.120 --> 2:14:13.320]  deserves it so there you go now Owen shroyer is it one of the overflow hotels
[2:14:13.320 --> 2:14:18.480]  as of a few days ago it was 10 hotels in a gallon alone that are overflowed for

[2:15:42.080 --> 2:15:46.160]  million views I mean it needs to be seen no one else is doing it so we've gone
[2:15:46.160 --> 2:15:51.240]  and shown it we've gone and documented it we've got the holy grail of the
[2:15:51.240 --> 2:15:55.320]  illegal garbage and the FBI waving the background checks into the mass smuggling
[2:15:55.320 --> 2:16:00.880]  and just just ms-13 running it and just total insanity they've undercover police
[2:16:00.880 --> 2:16:04.120]  that are on our side going in and getting us all this information so a lot
[2:16:04.120 --> 2:16:08.360]  of locals are upset but only you can get the articles and the videos and the
[2:16:08.360 --> 2:16:12.080]  material at bandot video and share it but you can't share bandot video it's
[2:16:12.080 --> 2:16:16.280]  blocked almost so you got to do ban this dot TV that is the URL currently not

[2:16:21.160 --> 2:16:27.560]  so the report is up on bandot video it's up on info wars.com it broke
[2:16:27.560 --> 2:16:32.800]  yesterday afternoon or last night miners loaded on planes little girls and boys
[2:16:32.800 --> 2:16:36.760]  to be given to random strangers and our undercovers talked to them they said the
[2:16:36.760 --> 2:16:41.880]  oldest was 18 years old she's the coyote or you would the eagle in the hawk
[2:16:41.880 --> 2:16:46.080]  the different names for it that that that goes through and that the TSA is it
[2:16:46.080 --> 2:16:49.720]  there they just stand down and they just are waved through and bye bye and no one
[2:16:49.720 --> 2:16:53.160]  even knows where they're going a smuggler's dream but because biden says
[2:16:53.160 --> 2:16:58.840]  it's okay everybody loves it 50,000 views up after like last night deserves a
[2:16:58.840 --> 2:17:02.640]  million views shocking video miners loaded on planes to be given to random
[2:17:02.640 --> 2:17:06.680]  strangers southern border collapse at southern border crisis section here's
[2:17:06.680 --> 2:17:10.640]  part of that report so here the unaccompanied miners in the mcallon
[2:17:10.640 --> 2:17:15.320]  texas airport and when I say unaccompanied folks so this lady talking to the
[2:17:15.320 --> 2:17:20.160]  board patrol agent who's very very young herself she's apparently going to go
[2:17:20.160 --> 2:17:24.560]  with them you see she has all their documents from the board control but
[2:17:24.560 --> 2:17:29.200]  notice not a single passport not a single ID card these are just packets that
[2:17:29.200 --> 2:17:36.360]  the board of patrol and a charity have typed up that's what they're given and
[2:17:36.360 --> 2:17:43.280]  you'll see board patrol agents speaking to them and he's asking if they have ID
[2:17:43.280 --> 2:17:52.440]  and of course they're saying no no IDs at all and so this is a sister or somebody
[2:17:52.440 --> 2:17:56.680]  that works for a charity in a black jacket with the purple bag she works for
[2:17:56.680 --> 2:18:01.240]  the charity she will not be going with that it's very young girl over here will
[2:18:01.240 --> 2:18:07.200]  be traveling with this group of miners none of them will have their parents here
[2:18:07.200 --> 2:18:22.560]  okay so again folks it's really important to note okay this is a system
[2:18:22.560 --> 2:18:26.960]  this is a pipeline that they have established okay to efficiently and
[2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:35.080]  effectively and quickly get people without legal documentation into the
[2:18:35.080 --> 2:18:44.440]  United States of America okay so and as you can see now she's waved through the
[2:18:44.440 --> 2:18:50.720]  checkpoint and she will be traveling and we're gonna get the full story here
[2:18:50.720 --> 2:19:00.280]  folks from the but again there's no ID card then they have the undercover that
[2:19:00.280 --> 2:19:03.760]  talks to them on the other side we had under covers throughout the airport that
[2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:08.560]  full report needs to be seen needs to go viral you know in the old days actually

[2:21:29.520 --> 2:21:35.360]  the power but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech we

[2:25:09.920 --> 2:25:16.920]  coming down fast but we're miles above on our journey to hell
[2:25:16.920 --> 2:25:42.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show well we've got Owen shroyer and our
[2:25:42.120 --> 2:25:45.960]  intrepid crew down on the Texas Mexico border and let them tell you where they
[2:25:45.960 --> 2:25:49.160]  are and what they're planning but when you drive around a gallon where I've
[2:25:49.160 --> 2:25:54.280]  been many times all the hotels are empty no cars basically because it's all
[2:25:54.280 --> 2:25:58.080]  filled with illegal aliens many of them children with people that aren't their
[2:25:58.080 --> 2:26:02.080]  parents I mean normally I mean in project Veritas broke the stuff we're
[2:26:02.080 --> 2:26:05.280]  breaking I'd say incredible Veritas you're amazing which we do they are
[2:26:05.280 --> 2:26:14.000]  breaking stuff this big breaking stuff as big as Veritas but we're not as able
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:17.760]  to get stuff out as them we were only able to get out through you and so thank
[2:26:17.760 --> 2:26:22.120]  you for joining us viewers and listeners thank you Owen and crew knocking it out
[2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:26.640]  of the park down there you're now in today I guess two and a half being there
[2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:30.680]  you've been there since Monday afternoon I'm gonna be joining you soon tell us
[2:26:30.680 --> 2:26:35.600]  what you witnessed tell us where you are what you're about to do so we are at
[2:26:35.600 --> 2:26:41.280]  another immigrants illegal immigrant overflow hotel and it's a roadway in
[2:26:41.280 --> 2:26:45.160]  and it's not even in McAllen it's about 10 miles out of McAllen in San Juan
[2:26:45.160 --> 2:26:50.360]  Texas so McAllen is now completely over capacity with the legal immigrants and
[2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:54.520]  now they're having that to bust them to other hotels now before I give you a
[2:26:54.520 --> 2:26:59.000]  walkthrough of the situation that we're in right now I want to give you a brief
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:04.960]  update here it's pretty much now confirmed with 99% positivity that the
[2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:08.040]  all of these organizations that we know are working together through the Rio
[2:27:08.040 --> 2:27:14.520]  Grand Valleys Catholic Charities they are identifying us and warning all their
[2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:17.400]  facilities that were there or what we look like for the vehicles because
[2:27:17.400 --> 2:27:20.640]  every time we come up on their facilities whether it's churches or
[2:27:20.640 --> 2:27:24.360]  hotels they immediately blocked the doors they immediately send somebody out
[2:27:24.360 --> 2:27:27.480]  to address us and say hey what are you doing okay you can see get out of here
[2:27:27.480 --> 2:27:30.520]  we already had and again if you're not doing anything wrong you don't cover it
[2:27:30.520 --> 2:27:35.320]  up yeah and they already called the cops on us today so we've had the cops called
[2:27:35.320 --> 2:27:38.360]  four times on us we've never done anything illegal now let me walk you
[2:27:38.360 --> 2:27:42.120]  through this hotel and the reason why we weren't standing on their property
[2:27:42.120 --> 2:27:47.320]  Alex is because I suspect as soon as I step on their property here that they're
[2:27:47.320 --> 2:27:50.760]  probably going to call the police but I want to show you what's going on here so
[2:27:50.760 --> 2:27:58.200]  again this is the roadway in San Juan Texas where they have another
[2:27:58.200 --> 2:28:02.800]  immigration overflow facility now this is a very large hotel I would say at least
[2:28:02.800 --> 2:28:08.120]  a hundred units and as you can see the parking lot as you said Alex is empty
[2:28:08.120 --> 2:28:13.800]  well how is the parking lot empty if it's a full hotel because I'm gonna show
[2:28:13.800 --> 2:28:18.360]  you on the door right here it says no vacancy and we're already getting yelled
[2:28:18.360 --> 2:28:22.280]  at right now by somebody Alex so we'll address this individual but I just want
[2:28:22.280 --> 2:28:25.880]  to show you guys no vacancy on the door so an individual is about to come talk

[2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:36.720]  facility that we come to let's be clear they call it all legal to have open
[2:30:36.720 --> 2:30:41.640]  borders and little kids and and an MS-13 people delivering kids everywhere it's
[2:30:41.640 --> 2:30:45.680]  illegal Biden didn't sign an executive order it violates federal law the FBI
[2:30:45.680 --> 2:30:50.680]  can't waive laws they can't waive laws and say there's no background checks for
[2:30:50.680 --> 2:30:54.840]  kids brought in the country and put on airplanes it's all a fraud are you in
[2:30:54.840 --> 2:31:02.000]  this hotel sir do you live in this hotel are you from America I have you
[2:31:02.000 --> 2:31:06.880]  got to find it for over is that why they sent you here does anyone make sure you
[2:31:06.880 --> 2:31:15.400]  stay here so you can leave whenever you want you you can or can't leave no
[2:31:15.400 --> 2:31:22.160]  nurses they don't like you why is that because you're white you say so we're
[2:31:22.160 --> 2:31:27.480]  messing with you sir yeah all right Alex they're calling the they're calling
[2:31:27.480 --> 2:31:31.680]  the police right now but I want to show you there's a public perception that
[2:31:31.680 --> 2:31:34.960]  that's an open business so once the police get there they had to present
[2:31:34.960 --> 2:31:38.480]  you with a letter of trespass and make you leave leave of you want now but you
[2:31:38.480 --> 2:31:43.000]  you know the drill it's all fraud no Alex we're gonna walk through the parking
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:46.840]  lot here just so you can see so you saw the no vacancy sign you saw him say
[2:31:46.840 --> 2:31:50.400]  that we're not welcome here as you can see that people are living here Alex you
[2:31:50.400 --> 2:31:54.080]  can see they're washing their clothes and their sink and they're letting it dry
[2:31:54.080 --> 2:32:00.080]  out on these rails out on these trees right here and again no no cars here so
[2:32:00.080 --> 2:32:05.120]  the whole hotel a hundred units is completely filled with non-citizens and
[2:32:05.120 --> 2:32:09.640]  I know because I was there last week you go to hotel after hotel after hotel in
[2:32:09.640 --> 2:32:15.080]  every town hundreds of hotels now no commerce no business COVID lockdown but
[2:32:15.080 --> 2:32:19.000]  illegal aliens pouring across everywhere and did you notice what the
[2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:22.120]  gentleman said to me he said his name was Palacios he claimed to be the owner of
[2:32:22.120 --> 2:32:25.320]  this hotel you notice what he said he said you're interfering with my business
[2:32:25.320 --> 2:32:30.320]  wait a second this hotel is booked solid for an indefinite period of time there's
[2:32:30.320 --> 2:32:33.840]  no the business is already solid so how am I interfering with this business oh
[2:32:33.840 --> 2:32:38.120]  because if we expose that what they're doing here is illegal maybe that shuts
[2:32:38.120 --> 2:32:41.760]  down his no bid contract well I mean look again they're all operating under
[2:32:41.760 --> 2:32:45.800]  Biden's saying do it and the Border Patrol follow his orders there's no
[2:32:45.800 --> 2:32:48.720]  executive order but he had the head of the Border Patrol order the illegal
[2:32:48.720 --> 2:32:52.280]  activity the Border Patrol said that they're hoping Congress tax but they're
[2:32:52.280 --> 2:32:55.640]  still I think doing wrong they should walk off the job I mean we really need
[2:32:55.640 --> 2:32:59.400]  boycotts we need the Border Patrol to boycott test and just walk off and not
[2:32:59.400 --> 2:33:03.040]  deliver all the illegals they'll all just pile up because they all expect a
[2:33:03.040 --> 2:33:07.720]  bunch of free money I mean my god we need a Border Patrol strike that's that
[2:33:07.720 --> 2:33:11.720]  will shut this down because these people are all paid to the coyotes are paid to
[2:33:11.720 --> 2:33:15.440]  the Democrats they've already paid up this is totally organized mechanized the
[2:33:15.440 --> 2:33:18.600]  answer is the Border Patrol and others need to walk off it's already lawless
[2:33:18.600 --> 2:33:23.640]  anyways go ahead completely agree Alex somebody has to take a leadership
[2:33:23.640 --> 2:33:28.640]  position on this and stop this at the source and right now we've talked to
[2:33:28.640 --> 2:33:32.200]  multiple federal agents they say you know it's just a strange time it's like
[2:33:32.200 --> 2:33:35.560]  Twilight Zone they're doing the exact opposite thing that they were hired and
[2:33:35.560 --> 2:33:38.880]  it's like we keep saying where's the governor he should do way more the state
[2:33:38.880 --> 2:33:41.440]  police are nowhere to be seen down there they just write tickets on the highway
[2:33:41.440 --> 2:33:47.960]  well where we need action now this is incredible yeah and they got the the so
[2:33:47.960 --> 2:33:51.280]  called owner has come back out here let me just complete showing you this entire
[2:33:51.280 --> 2:33:54.840]  facility and we'll go back and see if we can't talk to the owner again before the

[2:35:47.160 --> 2:35:50.320]  private person but because of the globalist and their attack on humanity
[2:35:50.320 --> 2:35:54.480]  I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure and we've given the
[2:35:54.480 --> 2:35:59.000]  globalist one hell of a run for their money because of God and I know some of
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:01.920]  our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day but just give me a break the
[2:36:01.920 --> 2:36:05.840]  statinism's out in the open I've always been a Christian but now the fact that
[2:36:05.840 --> 2:36:09.280]  it's a fight between good and evil is so clear and I get it a lot of you've been
[2:36:09.280 --> 2:36:13.120]  turned off by big churches a lot of you've been turned off by the corrupt
[2:36:13.120 --> 2:36:17.840]  priest class system and I get it me too believe me I'm one of them but it's
[2:36:17.840 --> 2:36:23.200]  that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created that is
[2:36:23.200 --> 2:36:27.200]  so essential and then God created the universe for us to have communion with
[2:36:27.200 --> 2:36:30.480]  God through and to have life and so that's what info wars is really all
[2:36:30.480 --> 2:36:33.640]  about so thank you all for your word of mouth thank you for spreading the word

[2:39:26.160 --> 2:39:29.440]  went to break for four minutes here on the alex jones show what happened since
[2:39:29.440 --> 2:39:35.640]  you were not with us so as expected the hotel called the cops on us and file
[2:39:35.640 --> 2:39:39.520]  the complaints it said we're not allowed on the property but there is a
[2:39:39.520 --> 2:39:43.360]  sidewalk right here in front of the hotel that we were told it's perfectly
[2:39:43.360 --> 2:39:50.920]  legal for us to stand here and record it and now they're coming over you aren't
[2:39:50.920 --> 2:39:56.240]  there are you homeless are you homeless sir no but I'm serious I'm trying to
[2:39:56.240 --> 2:40:00.800]  figure out what's going on here do you know he's one of the weirdos otherwise
[2:40:00.800 --> 2:40:05.840]  do you work here yeah I can't really get any answers out of this guy are you a
[2:40:05.840 --> 2:40:13.280]  man right on man just stop by to Alex yeah every time we try to talk
[2:40:13.280 --> 2:40:16.640]  to these people running the facilities they seem to be very nervous they seem
[2:40:16.640 --> 2:40:19.960]  to be very suspicious they obviously don't want media there if they believe
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:23.120]  what they're doing here is such a great thing if they really think this is a
[2:40:23.120 --> 2:40:26.120]  humanitarian thing they're doing and their heroes you think they want to
[2:40:26.120 --> 2:40:28.560]  promote it you think they want to promote their charities you think they'd
[2:40:28.560 --> 2:40:31.720]  want to be asking sure exactly let's have gears talk about what else you've
[2:40:31.720 --> 2:40:34.760]  seen since I talked to you last night you'll be hosting the war room come on
[2:40:34.760 --> 2:40:38.440]  appeared about an hour and ten minutes for three hours what else have you
[2:40:38.440 --> 2:40:42.720]  witnessed let's talk about Sam Montoya I mean Sam's a great guy been here three
[2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:47.520]  years went up there you know on his own because I said you got to stay here in
[2:40:47.520 --> 2:40:51.280]  Austin and run the shows but he started to go up there and I'm not saying that
[2:40:51.280 --> 2:40:54.480]  because I'm not glad he went to Capitol he shouldn't be indicted for this you
[2:40:54.480 --> 2:40:58.760]  know it's BS you've been indicted for simply confronting Nadler peacefully
[2:40:58.760 --> 2:41:03.360]  you're also arrested for doing a silent protest so you're you they've charged him
[2:41:03.360 --> 2:41:06.320]  with the same thing that I charged you with that you're currently fighting but
[2:41:06.320 --> 2:41:11.600]  they want to keep him in jail for months for this what do you make of it well
[2:41:11.600 --> 2:41:15.880]  the Democrats are completely out of control I mean this is really serious
[2:41:15.880 --> 2:41:19.480]  dangerous scary stuff quite frankly I really don't even like talking about it
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:23.440]  Alex I've been talking about it lately on air too but just how real this is
[2:41:23.440 --> 2:41:26.840]  getting how close this is getting I mean it's coming to our homes it's coming to
[2:41:26.840 --> 2:41:30.720]  our friends it's coming to our families this is the left this is communism this
[2:41:30.720 --> 2:41:35.560]  is fascism this is authoritarianism this is totalitarianism this is tyranny and
[2:41:35.560 --> 2:41:40.200]  we're just the front line standing against tyranny so of course they're
[2:41:40.200 --> 2:41:43.800]  gonna try to mop up and wipe out the front lines first because we come out
[2:41:43.800 --> 2:41:47.760]  here we expose all their crimes we whether it's covering the fake elections
[2:41:47.760 --> 2:41:50.800]  whether it's come whether it's covering the open borders whether it's
[2:41:50.800 --> 2:41:56.560]  covering up the fake pandemic we blow up all of their fake news we are the ones
[2:41:56.560 --> 2:41:59.920]  that are fighting the tyranny that's why they have to come after us first and you
[2:41:59.920 --> 2:42:05.640]  know Sam is one of dozens Sam is one of dozens right now because they were in
[2:42:05.640 --> 2:42:10.000]  DC on January 6th everybody knows the real criminals are still in DC
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:14.560]  everybody knows the real criminals have been in DC for decades and now that they
[2:42:14.560 --> 2:42:18.920]  know we're on to them Chuck Schumer the Nancy Pelosi's the Maxine Waters of the
[2:42:18.920 --> 2:42:23.400]  world they want to do away with the pesty Americans they want to do away
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:27.680]  with the and Owen down on the Texas Mexican border that's collapsed let's
[2:42:27.680 --> 2:42:31.840]  let's talk about that we don't want to be the only ones down there covering it
[2:42:31.840 --> 2:42:35.040]  yet sensational yeah we get a lot of viewers we don't care we wish there were
[2:42:35.040 --> 2:42:39.800]  satellite trucks everywhere this is incredible stuff but because it's not on
[2:42:39.800 --> 2:42:44.600]  the news we shoot video of the anchor babies or the smuggler cars and people
[2:42:44.600 --> 2:42:48.080]  think it's fake like we have a two hundred million dollar budget to shoot
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:52.320]  something like that I mean because so we wish and there's the police we wish
[2:42:52.320 --> 2:42:57.800]  everybody I mean there's no coverage of this Owen yeah so there's two police
[2:42:57.800 --> 2:43:00.560]  here now they're still complaining they're trying to throw us off the
[2:43:00.560 --> 2:43:09.720]  sidewalk but this is public property and again it's like if you're in any
[2:43:09.720 --> 2:43:14.120]  of these areas or you're in any of these facilities if they protect these
[2:43:14.120 --> 2:43:18.280]  illegal immigrants like there's a lot of the Alex they protect these illegal
[2:43:18.280 --> 2:43:22.120]  immigrants like they're part of a business infrastructure and they don't
[2:43:22.120 --> 2:43:25.720]  want media talking to them they don't want media exposing what's going on I
[2:43:25.720 --> 2:43:29.920]  can't tell room anywhere you can't go talk to these people around their
[2:43:29.920 --> 2:43:34.120]  facilities every hotel including the one we were staying at last time was
[2:43:34.120 --> 2:43:38.640]  having job fairs to oversee all the illegal aliens this is industrial level
[2:43:38.640 --> 2:43:42.800]  collapse where is Congress where are the hearings Biden doesn't have the
[2:43:42.800 --> 2:43:47.200]  authority to do this I mean sure Ted Cruz went down there great where is
[2:43:47.200 --> 2:43:51.640]  everybody else so and why is that not happening and to echo what you said
[2:43:51.640 --> 2:43:56.240]  earlier Alex how is this how is every media outlet not down here cover I mean
[2:43:56.240 --> 2:44:01.320]  it's unbelievable we came here today Alex and it didn't even take 30 seconds we
[2:44:01.320 --> 2:44:05.080]  heard about a facility over here we drove into San Juan we found the Rio
[2:44:05.080 --> 2:44:09.520]  Grand Valley's Charity Center it took five minutes and then we followed a bus
[2:44:09.520 --> 2:44:14.280]  load to this hotel the roadway in in San Juan we followed a bus load boom they
[2:44:14.280 --> 2:44:17.640]  dropped them off we followed the bus load boom they took another load to the
[2:44:17.640 --> 2:44:21.960]  McCallan Center it's not even you come here it happens 24-7 it's like oh I'm
[2:44:21.960 --> 2:44:24.480]  gonna go to the diner I'm gonna get up I'm gonna give a cheeseburger you know
[2:44:24.480 --> 2:44:26.800]  you're gonna go get a cheeseburger you're gonna do them soda well I'm gonna
[2:44:26.800 --> 2:44:29.480]  go to one of these illegal immigrant facilities and you know you're gonna see
[2:44:29.480 --> 2:44:33.120]  band loads you're gonna see bus loads you're gonna see tons of children that's
[2:44:33.120 --> 2:44:37.920]  mostly what this is here Alex these are mostly children and adults they don't
[2:44:37.920 --> 2:44:44.360]  know if they're related they don't know that violates federal and state law and
[2:44:44.360 --> 2:44:48.440]  you can say okay well the TSA law Congress passed back in 2002 or whatever
[2:44:48.440 --> 2:44:53.440]  is unconstitutional well doesn't matter it's in place for us the citizens it's
[2:44:53.440 --> 2:44:57.440]  not in place where it's supposed to be under other federal law at the border
[2:44:57.440 --> 2:45:01.640]  with children being smuggled and Senate reports that's been done in mass
[2:45:01.640 --> 2:45:08.720]  before so I mean we could do citizens arrest I'm not calling for that I'm just
[2:45:08.720 --> 2:45:13.160]  saying this is illegal this is out of control and this is brazen why do you
[2:45:13.160 --> 2:45:17.360]  think Biden is so arrogant and why do you think Congress is enacting on this
[2:45:17.360 --> 2:45:22.320]  we've just become numb to the journey they're making their move Alex that's
[2:45:22.320 --> 2:45:25.200]  what it is they're making their move on all fronts and you know you really
[2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:29.240]  think about it again it's they have all their pieces in place right now to just
[2:45:29.240 --> 2:45:33.880]  twist that lever and all the gears will match that you know they've got another
[2:45:33.880 --> 2:45:39.480]  another COVID you know advanced by virus that they'll probably release out of a
[2:45:39.480 --> 2:45:43.760]  Wuhan lab or somewhere you know they got lockdowns ready and new legislation
[2:45:43.760 --> 2:45:47.120]  ready to lock this down you know they got schizophrenics of a mortal mess wound
[2:45:47.120 --> 2:45:52.040]  up to do mass shootings exactly they've also got their financial collapse are
[2:45:52.040 --> 2:45:54.760]  going to stage that's in the documents yeah exactly they've made their move
[2:45:54.760 --> 2:45:57.520]  that's why they don't care they don't care how obvious it is they don't care
[2:45:57.520 --> 2:46:03.000]  about it gets because this is just the beginning and again we get police called
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:06.120]  on us because we're out here executing our First Amendment they run in the
[2:46:06.120 --> 2:46:09.360]  legal immigration pipeline and I say hey you know what are the police doing
[2:46:09.360 --> 2:46:12.200]  here with us they should be in there talking to this guy they should be
[2:46:12.200 --> 2:46:17.080]  investigating why these children are in hotels without their parents they should
[2:46:17.080 --> 2:46:20.280]  be investigating why we have unaccompanied minors being put into hotel
[2:46:20.280 --> 2:46:26.040]  rooms with pouring adults they don't even have IDs they could lie about what
[2:46:26.040 --> 2:46:30.040]  they're doing I mean and there's all these weird men floating around going
[2:46:30.040 --> 2:46:34.360]  I'm here to get women loading them in vans that disappear I mean this is the
[2:46:34.360 --> 2:46:40.440]  I've never seen stuff like this in movies I mean this is like insane again we
[2:46:40.440 --> 2:46:44.680]  invite the media come cover this again did I stage this did I stage showing up
[2:46:44.680 --> 2:46:47.880]  and the police coming here with multiple cop cars and this guy over here
[2:46:47.880 --> 2:46:51.200]  complaining that the media is out here we stage all this no this is as real as
[2:46:51.200 --> 2:46:54.760]  it gets folks there's no staging that has to go on and we tell you the real story
[2:46:54.760 --> 2:46:59.120]  and when we get over the target that's why you see the fact that we take because
[2:46:59.120 --> 2:47:05.640]  we are over the target this is such this is such a money grabbing thing for the
[2:47:05.640 --> 2:47:08.440]  locals here like the hotel owner he likes it because he's making a bunch of
[2:47:08.440 --> 2:47:12.320]  money the bus drivers like it because they're making a bunch of money the
[2:47:12.320 --> 2:47:15.160]  airlines like it because they're making a bunch of money and citizens of
[2:47:15.160 --> 2:47:19.840]  McAllen have to pay to have this illegal immigration pipeline run through their
[2:47:19.840 --> 2:47:23.640]  town the United States of America is just having a wide open border and a
[2:47:23.640 --> 2:47:27.720]  welfare state so we're all gonna have to pay for this eventually somehow some way
[2:47:27.720 --> 2:47:32.080]  who's gonna leverage that debt how is that gonna be used to tell us tell us
[2:47:32.080 --> 2:47:35.320]  what's coming up I know you got a lot of reports you're behind not in a bad way
[2:47:35.320 --> 2:47:39.240]  behind on their piling up with limited crew I know you've got a lot more shot
[2:47:39.240 --> 2:47:42.440]  what are we gonna see at man dot video today what are we gonna see at info wars
[2:47:42.440 --> 2:47:49.440]  dot com what else you got we had a plan to do a drone shoot the kind of do drone
[2:47:49.440 --> 2:47:52.440]  footage above the facility and then show them the walk that they go to the
[2:47:52.440 --> 2:47:57.920]  Catholic Charities but we ran into a bit of a snafu and a no fly zone right
[2:47:57.920 --> 2:48:02.680]  above the illegal immigration facilities if you can believe that a no fly
[2:48:02.680 --> 2:48:06.440]  zone and as you can see it looks like more people are being delivered right
[2:48:06.440 --> 2:48:10.960]  now there's another lady going in there with an envelope honestly Alex there's
[2:48:10.960 --> 2:48:14.880]  so much happening 24-7 here I don't even know where to begin you know it's a
[2:48:14.880 --> 2:48:17.880]  damn illegal immigration pipeline there's thousands of them coming in every
[2:48:17.880 --> 2:48:21.880]  day there's dozens of hotels there's dozens of drivers there's suspicious

[2:50:41.840 --> 2:50:45.680]  so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together
[2:50:45.680 --> 2:50:49.000]  over the years and it's truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and

[2:51:04.400 --> 2:51:08.240]  together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you

[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:17.320]  future but again that's really up to you and up to God so please I hope God
[2:51:17.320 --> 2:51:21.960]  works through you and put some message in your heart to support us but again

[2:51:33.080 --> 2:51:40.760]  touch your heart to continue to support it for worse God bless you're listening
[2:51:40.760 --> 2:51:46.800]  to the Alex Jones show the companies that are having massive layoffs the
[2:51:46.800 --> 2:51:51.800]  companies that routinely find themselves on the brink of bankruptcy are time and
[2:51:51.800 --> 2:51:56.200]  time again bailed out by hundreds of millions of dollars from corporate
[2:51:56.200 --> 2:52:04.120]  conglomerates hundreds of millions vice the young Turks Huffington Post Buzzfeed
[2:52:04.120 --> 2:52:10.080]  I mean they're just there's just a fire hose of cash being poured into those
[2:52:10.080 --> 2:52:14.080]  places and they can barely stay afloat because they're liars because they're
[2:52:14.080 --> 2:52:20.560]  full of crap because they're deceitful ways are bound inevitably to fail
[2:52:20.560 --> 2:52:25.840]  because they're not based off of truth and human connection they're based off
[2:52:25.840 --> 2:52:31.040]  of lies and manipulation by corporate interests so it's I mean it's incredible
[2:52:31.040 --> 2:52:34.720]  that we've been able to maintain for as long as we have but it's not a sure
[2:52:34.720 --> 2:52:40.960]  thing and and we do not have those those big corporate you know mega national
[2:52:40.960 --> 2:52:44.960]  multinational mega corporations pouring hundreds of millions dollars into
[2:52:44.960 --> 2:52:49.360]  info wars you could only imagine if they were I mean what we could achieve would
[2:52:49.360 --> 2:52:54.640]  be absolutely incredible we can't rely on them they don't like us they wouldn't
[2:52:54.640 --> 2:52:56.960]  give us money and we wouldn't take it anyway because it would come with
[2:52:56.960 --> 2:53:01.400]  stipulations that we would not adhere to so instead we appeal to the American
[2:53:01.400 --> 2:53:07.080]  people at large to the individuals out there who together can so overwhelm the
[2:53:07.080 --> 2:53:13.000]  influence of just a few billionaires that you know the evidence is is here the
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:16.440]  evidence the proof is in the pudding I mean we can do it when we all get
[2:53:16.440 --> 2:53:22.120]  together when we all focus our power on a single issue or the the overarching
[2:53:22.120 --> 2:53:27.320]  issue of the corporate cabal that is now attempting to run everything in this
[2:53:27.320 --> 2:53:31.000]  country we can overwhelm them no matter how much money they have pumped into
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:35.480]  their coffers because we have the will of God at our backs like the wind in our
[2:53:35.480 --> 2:53:41.480]  sails let me give you an example of this clip 14 this is a woman with over
[2:53:41.480 --> 2:53:50.080]  400,000 followers on Instagram and yet she's got a little bit of honor left
[2:53:50.080 --> 2:53:54.720]  in her she's got a little bit of truth there at the forefront usually it's
[2:53:54.720 --> 2:53:57.440]  it's hard to even get followers on Instagram if you're not willing to
[2:53:57.440 --> 2:54:03.120]  whore yourself out here's a woman who did not do that refuses to do that and is
[2:54:03.120 --> 2:54:07.720]  now exposing the people trying to get her to do that she's a again an Instagram
[2:54:07.720 --> 2:54:13.880]  influencer with over 400,000 followers here's what she said about the vaccine
[2:54:13.880 --> 2:54:20.320]  to debate or anything but I've just seen obviously the vaccine tab and teach
[2:54:20.320 --> 2:54:24.680]  their own if you want to get the vaccine get the vaccine to each your own but I
[2:54:24.680 --> 2:54:30.120]  did just want to make a little note that I've received two back campaigns
[2:54:30.120 --> 2:54:34.760]  paying thousands of dollars to go and get a vaccine or go get the vaccine and
[2:54:34.760 --> 2:54:40.880]  record it and take a selfie while getting the vaccine just gonna throw that
[2:54:40.880 --> 2:54:48.080]  out there mmm it's not interesting isn't that interesting who's doing this
[2:54:48.080 --> 2:54:53.600]  who's offering this money why are they offering this money is it your money is
[2:54:53.600 --> 2:54:58.320]  this your tax dollars is this government organizations tearing this out is this
[2:54:58.320 --> 2:55:02.600]  non-governmental organizations funded by the Open Society Foundation or some
[2:55:02.600 --> 2:55:10.440]  sort of other Soros Gates Rothschild you know front group putting this money up
[2:55:10.440 --> 2:55:15.760]  is it the pharmaceutical companies themselves some of the most evil wicked
[2:55:15.760 --> 2:55:22.000]  deceitful death-causing you know immoral companies in the history of the world
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:26.720]  are pharmaceutical companies oh but now we have to allow them to inject us with
[2:55:26.720 --> 2:55:31.920]  an experimental serum or else we're the bad guys there you see people willingly
[2:55:31.920 --> 2:55:36.840]  taking their selfies people posting their vaccine cards eating their doughnuts
[2:55:36.840 --> 2:55:41.960]  that they're being rewarded with like a dog getting a retreat a treat for doing
[2:55:41.960 --> 2:55:48.840]  a trick truly incredible so you have she said twice she's been offered thousands
[2:55:48.840 --> 2:55:55.160]  of dollars to go get a vaccine and post a selfie with it knowing that this is the
[2:55:55.160 --> 2:55:59.960]  type of thing that influences her followers now 500 or you know 400,000
[2:55:59.960 --> 2:56:04.880]  plus followers that's a lot but there are a lot of influencers with that many
[2:56:04.880 --> 2:56:11.840]  people following them there are a lot of accounts on Twitter with over 400,000
[2:56:11.840 --> 2:56:17.240]  followers and probably every single one of them is receiving multiple offers of
[2:56:17.240 --> 2:56:25.200]  thousands of dollars to get the vaccine support it and encourage their
[2:56:25.200 --> 2:56:28.880]  followers to get it so this is what we're up against it's happening in the media
[2:56:28.880 --> 2:56:33.760]  tapping with the last few minutes of the American Journal with Harrison Smith
[2:56:33.760 --> 2:56:37.320]  he really does a first-rate job with the producers and crew and callers and
[2:56:37.320 --> 2:56:43.480]  guests weekday mornings 8 a.m. Central Paul Watson takes over now stay with us
[2:56:43.480 --> 2:56:49.200]  I'm a very humble person but I'm also a bold person and so as bad as things are
[2:56:49.200 --> 2:56:52.200]  with the globalist attacking humanity of all the terrible things that are
[2:56:52.200 --> 2:56:56.640]  unfolding I want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well
[2:56:56.640 --> 2:57:00.920]  I'm a public figure so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see
[2:57:00.920 --> 2:57:05.680]  it let me tell you whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even
[2:57:05.680 --> 2:57:11.320]  folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry people are really really
[2:57:11.320 --> 2:57:15.400]  away in the establishment they don't want to go along with the globalist but
[2:57:15.400 --> 2:57:19.080]  they're scared they're looking for leadership well that's where in force
[2:57:19.080 --> 2:57:22.120]  comes in you fund us you support him for worse where
[2:57:22.120 --> 2:57:26.320]  com you're a proxy at the same time we will then go out and do what the
[2:57:26.320 --> 2:57:30.800]  globalist says I'm popular but the globalist will target you for to show
[2:57:30.800 --> 2:57:35.160]  people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat that's our job so
[2:57:35.160 --> 2:57:40.000]  please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire so we can be the shock
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:58:07.720]  groups for the information war on this and before store.com and we are live it
[2:58:07.720 --> 2:58:12.560]  is April the 14th it is the summit news hour and it is the week of the great
[2:58:12.560 --> 2:58:18.520]  reopening or at least the start of it in the United Kingdom where we get the
[2:58:18.520 --> 2:58:22.840]  privilege afforded to us by government yes the state has allowed us in all its
[2:58:22.840 --> 2:58:28.160]  beneficence to sit outside a pub or a restaurant freezing our arses off
[2:58:28.160 --> 2:58:36.720]  enjoying a pint of lager with up to six people six whole people again it was
[2:58:36.720 --> 2:58:41.520]  literally snowing on Tuesday morning when they introduced these new rules
[2:58:41.520 --> 2:58:46.800]  they relaxed the rules it was literally snowing it was about five degrees not
[2:58:46.800 --> 2:58:51.760]  much fun to be had although there was video there was photographs of people
[2:58:51.760 --> 2:58:56.440]  and join themselves in so how and then we got all the usual recriminations from
[2:58:56.440 --> 2:59:01.960]  the fun police saying oh my god how dare they they're gonna cause a fourth wave
[2:59:01.960 --> 2:59:07.720]  well when are we gonna be able to go back to normal is the old normal ever
[2:59:07.720 --> 2:59:13.880]  coming back if every time we revert back to a semblance of normal behavior you
[2:59:13.880 --> 2:59:20.280]  have these nittying hysterical hyperventilating carons who come out and
[2:59:20.280 --> 2:59:24.040]  say oh you're gonna cause the fourth wave when are people gonna be able to go
[2:59:24.040 --> 2:59:30.560]  back to normal life is this timetable anything aside from total BS I would
[2:59:30.560 --> 2:59:33.680]  argue not but we're gonna start with some good news this is out of the
[2:59:33.680 --> 2:59:39.480]  telegraph quite a big revolt brewing in terms of the vaccine passport which we've
[2:59:39.480 --> 2:59:44.920]  talked about a lot telegraph reports we won't make customers show COVID passports
[2:59:44.920 --> 2:59:50.640]  hospitality firms born Boris Johnson now Johnson came out with a statement a
[2:59:50.640 --> 2:59:55.280]  couple of days ago we're gonna play the clip probably in the next segment now
[2:59:55.280 --> 3:00:00.840]  where he said the lockdown not the vaccine they're now even trashing their
[3:00:00.840 --> 3:00:05.840]  own vaccine which was supposedly the scientific cavalry that was coming to
[3:00:05.840 --> 3:00:10.880]  the rescue now the scientific establishment itself government spokes
[3:00:10.880 --> 3:00:15.720]  people are literally trashing their own vaccine you have celebrities tweeting
[3:00:15.720 --> 3:00:19.040]  that they've had the vaccine but they're still gonna wear two three masks
[3:00:19.040 --> 3:00:23.520]  they're not gonna go out they're not gonna see their family members literally
[3:00:23.520 --> 3:00:28.440]  undermining confidence and giving people no reason whatsoever to take the
[3:00:28.440 --> 3:00:34.440]  vaccine after having said the vaccine was vital it was incredibly important
[3:00:34.440 --> 3:00:39.040]  that we did not undermine confidence in it because obviously there are a lot of
[3:00:39.040 --> 3:00:43.480]  people who don't want to take it not just for fear of it causing side effects
[3:00:43.480 --> 3:00:48.360]  but criminals basically let's be honest and illegal aliens who don't want to
[3:00:48.360 --> 3:00:53.720]  have any confrontation any interaction with authorities on any level a lot of
[3:00:53.720 --> 3:01:00.040]  bane people a lot of black people have this natural disposition to not trust
[3:01:00.040 --> 3:01:04.880]  health authorities for many different reasons big public relations campaign in
[3:01:04.880 --> 3:01:09.320]  this country to try to get them to take the vaccine now we're being told it's
[3:01:09.320 --> 3:01:13.960]  not the vaccine that's helping it's the lockdown because there's gonna be a
[3:01:13.960 --> 3:01:22.040]  lockdown for this timetable is complete BS but there are rumblings of a revolt
[3:01:22.040 --> 3:01:26.600]  article says more than 60 restaurant owners nightclub operators and other
[3:01:26.600 --> 3:01:30.880]  hospitality figures have told Boris Johnson they will not force customers
[3:01:30.880 --> 3:01:36.280]  to show COVID passport bear in mind on a sidebar that this is the same Boris
[3:01:36.280 --> 3:01:43.360]  Johnson who for two years over the course of 2004 important point about 2005
[3:01:43.360 --> 3:01:49.480]  will go to clip in the next segment he was the same guy who for two years
[3:01:49.480 --> 3:01:55.680]  during the Blair years in the early part of the 2000s railed against ID cards to
[3:01:55.680 --> 3:01:59.360]  the point of literally saying if somebody asked him for his ID card in the
[3:01:59.360 --> 3:02:04.760]  street he would eat it up and spit it out this is the guy now setting up the
[3:02:04.760 --> 3:02:10.120]  COVID passport which is a biosecurity digital ID card but there is a revolt
[3:02:10.120 --> 3:02:15.360]  brewing because in a letter to the prime minister seen by the telegraph the
[3:02:15.360 --> 3:02:19.440]  signatories make clear their opposition to COVID status certification being used
[3:02:19.440 --> 3:02:23.960]  in hospitality settings now bear in mind the government has come out and said
[3:02:23.960 --> 3:02:30.640]  it won't be required now for anyone who wants to go into a pub or restaurant in
[3:02:30.640 --> 3:02:34.960]  fact Boris Johnson was literally asked that question he was asked what would
[3:02:34.960 --> 3:02:39.120]  these COVID passport be required for pubs and restaurants and he basically said
[3:02:39.120 --> 3:02:44.320]  no not tomorrow meaning not within that small window where they're still
[3:02:44.320 --> 3:02:48.720]  developing them they lied to the public for the past six months claiming there
[3:02:48.720 --> 3:02:53.200]  was no plans whatsoever for a domestic vaccine passport meanwhile they're
[3:02:53.200 --> 3:02:57.720]  literally funding to the tune of millions of pounds the companies that
[3:02:57.720 --> 3:03:01.760]  were developing the technology while telling the public that it was never
[3:03:01.760 --> 3:03:05.200]  going to be on the agenda they lied about that they're gonna lie about the
[3:03:05.200 --> 3:03:11.760]  timetable but this letter signed by these restaurant and nightclub owners says
[3:03:11.760 --> 3:03:16.440]  we will not be forcing our patrons to show us any documentation referring to
[3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:21.960]  health status to gain entry says the intervention is a shot across the
[3:03:21.960 --> 3:03:24.920]  bars of the government as ministers consider whether to require restaurants
[3:03:24.920 --> 3:03:29.080]  and pubs to check the COVID status of customers and just from anecdotal
[3:03:29.080 --> 3:03:35.400]  evidence a lot of these premises are not enforcing this mandate which is
[3:03:35.400 --> 3:03:40.320]  interesting because if you read about the so-called green pass the vaccine
[3:03:40.320 --> 3:03:45.120]  passport in Israel you see the same thing occurring Israel introduced their
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:50.280]  vaccine passport to try to convince young people to get the vaccine and
[3:03:50.280 --> 3:03:54.880]  largely it worked huge numbers of young people get got the vaccine as a result
[3:03:54.880 --> 3:03:59.920]  of the threat or the promise of not being able to go back into nightclubs
[3:03:59.920 --> 3:04:05.440]  bars restaurants etc it worked but then if you read about how it's being enforced
[3:04:05.440 --> 3:04:10.440]  it's not being enforced the owners of the premises the bars restaurants night
[3:04:10.440 --> 3:04:15.400]  clubs are not asking for Israelis when they go into these venues to show their
[3:04:15.400 --> 3:04:19.160]  vaccine passport and in fact the government in Israel gave them no
[3:04:19.160 --> 3:04:23.320]  advice on how to enforce it the authorities themselves have not stepped
[3:04:23.320 --> 3:04:28.760]  in and said no you need to enforce it so it was entirely a public relations
[3:04:28.760 --> 3:04:33.200]  ploy to make people take the vaccine they're not actually enforcing the
[3:04:33.200 --> 3:04:39.400]  vaccine passport at least not at this point but the UK government in its own
[3:04:39.400 --> 3:04:45.000]  vaccine passport planning document did not rule out introducing it cinemas for
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:50.080]  pubs for nightclubs they're already doing tests at these big stadia sports
[3:04:50.080 --> 3:04:54.240]  events over the next couple of months again after having lied to the public
[3:04:54.240 --> 3:04:59.000]  for the past six months and said that it was never on the agenda but among the
[3:04:59.000 --> 3:05:04.320]  signatories are the CEOs of Wreckham UK which runs 42 nightclubs and Tokyo
[3:05:04.320 --> 3:05:08.080]  industries which runs clubs festivals and bars others backing the letting
[3:05:08.080 --> 3:05:12.160]  close senior figures at venues such as the hippodrome casino big casino in
[3:05:12.160 --> 3:05:17.640]  London electric star pubs Bocca de Lupo proud cabaret Brindisa and burger and
[3:05:17.640 --> 3:05:23.280]  lobster by the way as I was saying from anecdotal evidence I haven't been out to
[3:05:23.280 --> 3:05:27.120]  a pub yet this week and celebrated this great freedom that the government has
[3:05:27.120 --> 3:05:31.600]  given us this great privilege of engaging in basic everyday normal
[3:05:31.600 --> 3:05:37.120]  behavior because I don't want to have idiots in masks screeching at me
[3:05:37.120 --> 3:05:40.760]  demanding my details be put into a database but from what I've been told
[3:05:40.760 --> 3:05:46.080]  from friends who have been out to the pub it's either being enforced in a very
[3:05:46.080 --> 3:05:51.960]  lax manner or it's not being enforced at all and that's what you see with a lot
[3:05:51.960 --> 3:05:55.920]  of these businesses that have lost tons of money over the course of the pandemic
[3:05:55.920 --> 3:05:59.640]  while billionaires have literally doubled their wealth transnational
[3:05:59.640 --> 3:06:04.200]  corporations have swallowed up their competition and grown fat on the profits
[3:06:04.200 --> 3:06:08.320]  of this pandemic you will find that a lot of these small businesses are
[3:06:08.320 --> 3:06:13.200]  revolting against this tyranny against this attack on their livelihood by
[3:06:13.200 --> 3:06:18.560]  refusing to enforce these mandates the local hairdressers that I go to which I
[3:06:18.560 --> 3:06:23.680]  won't name for obvious reasons enforcers absolutely nothing they don't wear
[3:06:23.680 --> 3:06:29.000]  masks they don't care and they think the whole thing's basically a fraud so a lot
[3:06:29.000 --> 3:06:34.840]  of premises are similar and now we've had this letter with all these different
[3:06:34.840 --> 3:06:39.240]  nightclub bar restaurant owners saying they are not going to enforce the COVID
[3:06:39.240 --> 3:06:43.920]  passport whatever the government tells them to do and it's an open letter that
[3:06:43.920 --> 3:06:48.560]  will be added to and they've invited other business bar nightclub owners to
[3:06:48.560 --> 3:06:54.360]  add their name to that list so a big revolt brewing in terms of the vaccine
[3:06:54.360 --> 3:06:59.920]  passport we also have this which I'll get into more after the break but finally
[3:06:59.920 --> 3:07:05.400]  Christian leaders perhaps understanding that the vaccine passport is going to be
[3:07:05.400 --> 3:07:09.520]  an integral part of an embryonic social credit score here in Western Europe a
[3:07:09.520 --> 3:07:14.800]  finally growing a backbone lockdown skeptics reports Christian leaders
[3:07:14.800 --> 3:07:18.320]  warn against the introduction of medical apartheid under a vaccine passport
[3:07:18.320 --> 3:07:22.840]  scheme you would hope they'd also have read the book of revelations where it
[3:07:22.840 --> 3:07:28.000]  says nobody who hasn't hasn't had the mark would have the right to buy or sell
[3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:34.080]  quite similar to what's unfolding in reality in 2021 we'll be right back this
[3:07:34.080 --> 3:07:38.560]  is the summit news hour more to come join us on the other side we'll be right
[3:07:38.560 --> 3:07:40.760]  back
[3:07:41.800 --> 3:07:48.880]  epic is one of only a handful of domain registrars that promote free speech and
[3:07:48.880 --> 3:07:53.600]  freedom of association and they know that big tech is buying up almost all the
[3:07:53.600 --> 3:07:57.680]  other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime

[3:10:11.680 --> 3:10:15.680]  this so-called lifting of coronavirus lockdown restrictions in the United
[3:10:15.680 --> 3:10:20.880]  Kingdom we've seen an increase in policing of behavior that would otherwise
[3:10:20.880 --> 3:10:25.920]  in any other time in recent history it described as perfectly normal reasonable
[3:10:25.920 --> 3:10:31.280]  behavior in fact there was a an image on the day that the shops opened a couple
[3:10:31.280 --> 3:10:36.400]  of days ago in London from Oxford Street and it's featured at the top of the
[3:10:36.400 --> 3:10:40.600]  story which is headlined Paul significant proportion of Brits say they
[3:10:40.600 --> 3:10:44.720]  have enjoyed lockdown which I'm going to get into later and it's of this
[3:10:44.720 --> 3:10:50.840]  ethnically ambiguous security guard wearing his mask obviously but it looks
[3:10:50.840 --> 3:10:57.760]  more like a ski mask he's literally got an attack dog waiting to pounce this is
[3:10:57.760 --> 3:11:02.760]  the new biosecurity police state that's been gradually rolled out even as they
[3:11:02.760 --> 3:11:07.520]  tell us that our freedoms are being returned to us as if that was ever a
[3:11:07.520 --> 3:11:13.680]  reasonable deal in the first place of course in under English common law any
[3:11:13.680 --> 3:11:20.400]  kind of behavior is legal unless it's expressly disallowed or made illegal by
[3:11:20.400 --> 3:11:24.800]  the government that entire philosophy has been completely reversed over the
[3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:30.280]  past year and now every freedom that we enjoy is provided to us by the government
[3:11:30.280 --> 3:11:35.960]  on condition of our compliance and our personal behavior being in line with
[3:11:35.960 --> 3:11:41.480]  exactly what they want that didn't happen in the case of a Scottish grandmother
[3:11:41.480 --> 3:11:46.000]  headline out of the Daily Mail why do I need to shield if I've had the vaccine
[3:11:46.000 --> 3:11:51.040]  Scottish grandmother 82 who stayed indoors for a year is given a 60 pound
[3:11:51.040 --> 3:11:56.640]  COVID fine after police broke up illegal 70th birthday with seven friends
[3:11:56.640 --> 3:12:03.080]  despite them all having the jab so there's eight people they've all had the
[3:12:03.080 --> 3:12:10.680]  jab it's a 70 year old woman's birthday party at her own home the police broke
[3:12:10.680 --> 3:12:16.200]  up the celebration can you imagine reading a headline 13 14 months ago
[3:12:16.200 --> 3:12:22.440]  about police breaking into someone's home and issuing fines to grandmothers
[3:12:22.440 --> 3:12:27.040]  because they had seven of their friends around for a birthday party that's our
[3:12:27.040 --> 3:12:32.520]  new normal but it turns out that she got away lightly because in Liverpool
[3:12:32.520 --> 3:12:38.680]  Merseyside in the UK police break down door arrest man for violating COVID
[3:12:38.680 --> 3:12:44.680]  quarantine rules we have the one-minute clip of this shocking incident and here
[3:12:44.680 --> 3:12:46.680]  it is
[3:13:14.680 --> 3:13:35.440]  you're under arrest for a breach of COVID regulations you've failed the
[3:13:35.440 --> 3:13:40.000]  quarantine in a designated hotel when instructed to do so you do not have to
[3:13:40.000 --> 3:13:56.160]  so there you have it literally because the guy presumably went on holiday to one
[3:13:56.160 --> 3:14:02.080]  of these red list countries he comes back and he refuses or fails to quarantine
[3:14:02.080 --> 3:14:07.720]  in a hotel you literally have to pay to quarantine yourself in a hotel returning
[3:14:07.720 --> 3:14:13.040]  to your own country people who even travel to the airport by the way with
[3:14:13.040 --> 3:14:17.800]  the intention of going on holiday or going abroad for quote no good reason
[3:14:17.800 --> 3:14:25.560]  or immediately find five thousand pounds this guy who allegedly returned to his
[3:14:25.560 --> 3:14:30.480]  own country from another country which was on the government's red list and
[3:14:30.480 --> 3:14:35.720]  failed to put himself under house arrest in a government run hotel pay for his
[3:14:35.720 --> 3:14:41.280]  own imprisonment now only does he face a fine of up to ten thousand pounds he
[3:14:41.280 --> 3:14:47.640]  faces a prison sentence of up to ten years in jail simply for returning to
[3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:52.960]  his own country and refusing to put himself under house arrest over a virus
[3:14:52.960 --> 3:14:59.840]  which even if he caught it he would have a 99.8% chance of surviving this is the
[3:14:59.840 --> 3:15:04.880]  new biosecurity police state and it's one that's not ending anytime soon because
[3:15:04.880 --> 3:15:10.680]  now Boris Johnson even before these measures have been lifted completely is
[3:15:10.680 --> 3:15:14.960]  already making noises that he's going to impose lockdown for we have that clip
[3:15:14.960 --> 3:15:19.120]  from a BBC interview let's roll it right now
[3:15:19.120 --> 3:15:24.160]  I want to make a very important point about about where we are with the with
[3:15:24.160 --> 3:15:29.360]  the pandemic because clearly everybody's been able yesterday to to go to the pub
[3:15:29.360 --> 3:15:35.640]  as you'll be going to the pub to go shopping get a haircut and so on and
[3:15:35.640 --> 3:15:41.480]  that's that's great and the numbers are down of infections and hospitalizations
[3:15:41.480 --> 3:15:47.480]  and and deaths but it is very very important for everybody to understand
[3:15:47.480 --> 3:15:53.760]  that the reduction in these numbers in hospitalizations and in deaths and in
[3:15:53.760 --> 3:15:59.520]  infections has not been achieved by the vaccination program people don't I
[3:15:59.520 --> 3:16:04.480]  think appreciate that it's the lockdown that has been overwhelmingly important
[3:16:04.480 --> 3:16:11.520]  in delivering this improvement in in the in the the pandemic and in the figures
[3:16:11.520 --> 3:16:16.800]  that we're seeing and so yes of course the vaccination program has helped but
[3:16:16.800 --> 3:16:22.320]  the bulk of the work in reducing the disease has been done by the lockdown so
[3:16:22.320 --> 3:16:29.680]  as we unlock the result will inevitably be that we will see more
[3:16:29.680 --> 3:16:35.080]  infection now we are sadly we will see more hospitalization and and and and
[3:16:35.080 --> 3:16:41.880]  deaths and people have just got to understand that at the moment I can't
[3:16:41.880 --> 3:16:49.520]  see any reason for us to change the roadmap to deviate from the the targets
[3:16:49.520 --> 3:16:54.640]  that we've we've set ourselves and you know what they are May the 17th June the
[3:16:54.640 --> 3:17:03.840]  21st the next way marks on them on the roadmap but he's very very important
[3:17:03.840 --> 3:17:08.760]  that if we're to get there in the way that we all want that can people continue
[3:17:08.760 --> 3:17:16.360]  to be cautious now we know the timetable the unlocking itself is complete
[3:17:16.360 --> 3:17:21.040]  BS because even after that day on June 21st we're going to have sporting events
[3:17:21.040 --> 3:17:24.920]  football matches where the government has said the capacity at those matches
[3:17:24.920 --> 3:17:30.840]  will be I think the maximum is 50% after all the restrictions we were told are
[3:17:30.840 --> 3:17:34.000]  going to be lifted there are still going to be restrictions proving its
[3:17:34.000 --> 3:17:39.600]  nonsense the other point is the cases were falling on all three occasions
[3:17:39.600 --> 3:17:44.520]  before the lockdown so the lockdown had no effect the cases were already falling
[3:17:44.520 --> 3:17:49.920]  and as lockdown skeptics reports Boris is wrong the lockdown has not been
[3:17:49.920 --> 3:17:55.680]  overwhelmingly important you can compare it to Texas Georgia Florida South
[3:17:55.680 --> 3:18:01.120]  Dakota and specifically Sweden which had a similar almost identical trajectory
[3:18:01.120 --> 3:18:06.920]  in terms of cases COVID cases as the United Kingdom a slightly lower death
[3:18:06.920 --> 3:18:11.280]  rate as well and of course as we know Sweden did not lock down at any point
[3:18:11.280 --> 3:18:16.520]  yet the trajectory of how these cases rose and fell almost mirrors what
[3:18:16.520 --> 3:18:22.280]  happened in the United Kingdom with those three separate lockdowns so when he
[3:18:22.280 --> 3:18:26.680]  talks about lockdown being to thank for all this and that the vaccine apparently
[3:18:26.680 --> 3:18:29.560]  doesn't really matter at this point with them having triumphed it for so many
[3:18:29.560 --> 3:18:33.880]  months we know that that's because they're preparing us for lockdown for
[3:18:33.880 --> 3:18:39.120]  because they're gonna blame our freedoms being exercised on a fourth wave of the
[3:18:39.120 --> 3:18:43.280]  pandemic don't go away we'll be right back you know listeners call into the
[3:18:43.280 --> 3:18:48.640]  show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there and
[3:18:48.640 --> 3:18:53.920]  I beg you for support constantly for prayer for financial support and for word
[3:18:53.920 --> 3:18:57.760]  of mouth and then we're all this together and I you know it gets old having
[3:18:57.760 --> 3:19:00.680]  to come to you and say hey I got great products please bomb or we won't be here
[3:19:00.680 --> 3:19:04.200]  on air but it's true for the only media organization in the United States that
[3:19:04.200 --> 3:19:08.160]  promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors
[3:19:08.160 --> 3:19:11.520]  and they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else they crippled all the
[3:19:11.520 --> 3:19:15.600]  other groups and we're still here and as this whole new world order comes out in
[3:19:15.600 --> 3:19:19.160]  the open our credibility is going up that's why we've got to be taken off
[3:19:19.160 --> 3:19:22.160]  air that's why America has got to be taken down you can't have all these

[3:19:50.160 --> 3:19:53.840]  in amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a
[3:19:53.840 --> 3:19:58.960]  hold of you for a year okay I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria
[3:19:58.960 --> 3:20:03.720]  infection on my lung that'll never go away living defense saved my life they
[3:20:03.720 --> 3:20:08.800]  had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought
[3:20:08.800 --> 3:20:14.280]  me back I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are
[3:20:14.280 --> 3:20:19.880]  right now this is Matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be
[3:20:19.880 --> 3:20:25.800]  afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my
[3:20:25.800 --> 3:20:31.120]  namesake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall
[3:20:31.120 --> 3:20:35.240]  hate one another that's right where we're at brother and that's because God's
[3:20:35.240 --> 3:20:38.800]  name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why
[3:20:38.800 --> 3:20:43.520]  the enemy hates it because God created this country the globalists are
[3:20:43.520 --> 3:20:48.040]  purposely collapsing our world they are creating insecurity crime war and

[3:22:44.560 --> 3:22:54.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:22:57.640 --> 3:23:03.160]  broadcasting internationally from the summit top news headquarters in the
[3:23:03.160 --> 3:23:08.800]  United Kingdom it's Paul Joseph Watson
[3:23:08.800 --> 3:23:14.480]  now when you watch that chilling video of police smashing into a man's house the
[3:23:14.480 --> 3:23:18.000]  glass almost hitting the dog as it panics and runs up the stairs and him
[3:23:18.000 --> 3:23:23.680]  being put in handcuffs as he's told he violated COVID quarantine rules bear in
[3:23:23.680 --> 3:23:27.800]  mind that that's precisely what China was doing over a year ago when this
[3:23:27.800 --> 3:23:33.120]  pandemic was begun by them deliberately releasing the virus from lab as
[3:23:33.120 --> 3:23:40.160]  some people claim we also saw footage of people being welded inside their homes
[3:23:40.160 --> 3:23:45.360]  in China people being kidnapped off the street for failing to quarantine
[3:23:45.360 --> 3:23:51.560]  properly thrown into government vans and taken to quarantine camps and of
[3:23:51.560 --> 3:23:55.560]  course we said oh that could never happen here well it is happening here and
[3:23:55.560 --> 3:23:59.320]  in fact the government advisors that put us under lockdown in the first place
[3:23:59.320 --> 3:24:05.320]  planned it all along professor Neil Ferguson this was the guy who set up
[3:24:05.320 --> 3:24:09.840]  the model the completely inaccurate model that claimed half a million people
[3:24:09.840 --> 3:24:16.400]  in the UK would die from coronavirus now he looked at what China did and of
[3:24:16.400 --> 3:24:20.960]  course China became the global example of how to respond to a virus pandemic
[3:24:20.960 --> 3:24:25.960]  beforehand it was herd immunity suddenly that became a dirty word and the only
[3:24:25.960 --> 3:24:30.520]  way to respond to it was to keep the population locked up for a year enabling
[3:24:30.520 --> 3:24:35.560]  it to develop no herd immunity whatsoever naturally so China became the
[3:24:35.560 --> 3:24:38.800]  global model of how to respond to the pandemic China was praised for its
[3:24:38.800 --> 3:24:44.120]  actions professor Neil Ferguson the head of the or an advisor to sage which
[3:24:44.120 --> 3:24:47.800]  advises the government he was responsible for creating the model that
[3:24:47.800 --> 3:24:52.840]  would led to the lockdown of the UK despite the Boris Johnson beforehand
[3:24:52.840 --> 3:24:56.960]  was going to go for herd immunity his mind was changed by Ferguson and others
[3:24:56.960 --> 3:25:02.680]  like him this was the same guy who thought that the virus was so deadly
[3:25:02.680 --> 3:25:09.040]  represented such a threat that he had to advise the Prime Minister to put the
[3:25:09.040 --> 3:25:15.240]  entire country under lockdown but him personally he was traveling 45 minutes
[3:25:15.240 --> 3:25:20.680]  across London to go and shag his married mistress right at the high of the
[3:25:20.680 --> 3:25:25.480]  first lockdown when everyone else was only able to go outside for an hours
[3:25:25.480 --> 3:25:32.280]  exercise and to buy food at the local grocery store this guy though the guy
[3:25:32.280 --> 3:25:35.760]  who told us the pandemic the virus was such a threat we needed to lock down
[3:25:35.760 --> 3:25:40.720]  or half a million people would die he was traveling 45 minutes across London to
[3:25:40.720 --> 3:25:46.160]  have sex with his married mistress the rules didn't apply to him and he didn't
[3:25:46.160 --> 3:25:51.320]  appear to treat the virus as seriously as he told the public when he was
[3:25:51.320 --> 3:25:57.800]  advising the government but he said in response to China's actions in detaining
[3:25:57.800 --> 3:26:02.160]  people welding people inside their houses that authoritative authoritarian
[3:26:02.160 --> 3:26:05.720]  draconian response in the early weeks and months of the pandemic he said
[3:26:05.720 --> 3:26:11.440]  quote it's a communist one-party state we said we couldn't get away with it in
[3:26:11.440 --> 3:26:18.720]  Europe we thought and then Italy did it and we realized we could so there he's
[3:26:18.720 --> 3:26:22.000]  openly admitting that they looked at what China was doing and thought down
[3:26:22.000 --> 3:26:27.600]  we'll never get away with this but then the public began to accept it the
[3:26:27.600 --> 3:26:32.720]  public was terrorized by the non-stop propaganda to the point where polls
[3:26:32.720 --> 3:26:37.240]  showed that for example Americans back in August thought coronavirus had
[3:26:37.240 --> 3:26:44.280]  killed 30 million people in the United States 225 times more than it did people
[3:26:44.280 --> 3:26:50.800]  with that brainwashed that Professor Ferguson and his ilk knew then that
[3:26:50.800 --> 3:26:56.680]  they could get away with it and now we see people literally being raided the
[3:26:56.680 --> 3:27:02.000]  doors smashed down by police being put in handcuffs and this guy facing ten years
[3:27:02.000 --> 3:27:07.200]  in jail for the crime of not forcefully putting himself under house arrest and
[3:27:07.200 --> 3:27:13.360]  paying for the privilege after he returned to his own country this isn't
[3:27:13.360 --> 3:27:16.320]  gonna end here either as we saw before the break they're now talking about
[3:27:16.320 --> 3:27:20.520]  preparing the public for lockdown for they're gonna give us two months of
[3:27:20.520 --> 3:27:24.920]  freedom maybe three months of freedom and then they're gonna say oh well you
[3:27:24.920 --> 3:27:32.560]  just enjoyed yourself a little bit too much didn't you get back inside oh but
[3:27:32.560 --> 3:27:35.920]  we took the vaccine I thought the vaccine was the scientific cavalry to the rescue
[3:27:35.920 --> 3:27:41.080]  now forget about that we've changed our opinion they're gonna they're gonna end
[3:27:41.080 --> 3:27:45.360]  up saying their own vaccine doesn't work at this point meanwhile Frederick
[3:27:45.360 --> 3:27:50.120]  Forsythe acclaimed British author says government has launched campaign of mass
[3:27:50.120 --> 3:27:54.480]  fear against British public if only there were more people with his gravitas who
[3:27:54.480 --> 3:28:00.960]  were speaking out this was in response to a telegraph article who he
[3:28:00.960 --> 3:28:04.760]  congratulated the author for revealing that the campaign of mass fear that
[3:28:04.760 --> 3:28:09.360]  reduced a once brave nation to trembling terror was deliberately organized to
[3:28:09.360 --> 3:28:14.360]  secure obedience to the policy of lockdown that's from Frederick Forsythe
[3:28:14.360 --> 3:28:19.080]  himself he said quote I've only once before seen anything like it this was
[3:28:19.080 --> 3:28:25.120]  when I was posted to East Germany in 1962 such a brainwashing tactic was
[3:28:25.120 --> 3:28:29.040]  employed to frighten East Berliners into believing that the Berlin Wall was a
[3:28:29.040 --> 3:28:33.840]  defensive measure to protect them from tiny West Berlin and that the Stasi was
[3:28:33.840 --> 3:28:39.440]  their guardian the wall was of course an instrument of enslavement he went on to
[3:28:39.440 --> 3:28:42.320]  say I never thought that the government of a country whose uniform I once wore
[3:28:42.320 --> 3:28:46.960]  with such pride would sink so low those responsible should be identified
[3:28:46.960 --> 3:28:51.600]  without delay and ousted from all office over us that's Frederick Forsythe
[3:28:51.600 --> 3:28:56.840]  acclaimed author again talking about what he's witnessing reminds him of his
[3:28:56.840 --> 3:29:00.840]  experiences in East Germany with the starsy where of course one in seven of
[3:29:00.840 --> 3:29:06.120]  population was an informant for the state we had an article a couple of weeks
[3:29:06.120 --> 3:29:13.240]  ago where police endorse it a area of the UK down south which is popular amongst
[3:29:13.240 --> 3:29:19.240]  holiday makers came out the police chief came out and said we don't even need to
[3:29:19.240 --> 3:29:23.480]  patrol the beaches anymore we don't even need to patrol the parks anymore
[3:29:23.480 --> 3:29:31.040]  because we're getting so many tip-offs from public snoops from grasses that we
[3:29:31.040 --> 3:29:35.840]  just respond to them individually and they don't need to even patrol because
[3:29:35.840 --> 3:29:42.600]  the starsy like spies are doing their work for them he said quote the headline
[3:29:42.600 --> 3:29:47.040]  it by the way is UK police chief brags that COVID patrols aren't necessary
[3:29:47.040 --> 3:29:51.840]  because there are so many snitches so quote we are still getting around 400
[3:29:51.840 --> 3:29:56.400]  reports a week from the public this is in one area alone so we will respond to
[3:29:56.400 --> 3:30:00.800]  reports we won't need to be doing hotspot patrols because people are very
[3:30:00.800 --> 3:30:05.880]  quick to pick the phone up and tell us so again these are the curtain twitches
[3:30:05.880 --> 3:30:12.120]  the Karen's who see a family having fun on the beach who maybe see a grandkids
[3:30:12.120 --> 3:30:16.240]  who haven't seen their grandma for a year hugging literally the government
[3:30:16.240 --> 3:30:21.640]  told people not to hug each other by the way they also told hairdressers not to
[3:30:21.640 --> 3:30:27.160]  cut people's hair for too long a time they let's literally that level of
[3:30:27.160 --> 3:30:31.400]  micro management now so it's these to curtain twitching Karen's who are seeing
[3:30:31.400 --> 3:30:36.560]  this disgraceful normal life behavior calling the police the police are
[3:30:36.560 --> 3:30:40.320]  coming out now the police are bragging because of all these starsy like spies
[3:30:40.320 --> 3:30:47.720]  that they don't even need to patrol they just respond to the snitch reports good
[3:30:47.720 --> 3:30:53.160]  news out of Germany though again this is on lockdownskeptics.org Weimar court
[3:30:53.160 --> 3:30:57.160]  prohibits mask wearing distancing measures and rapid testing at schools a
[3:30:57.160 --> 3:31:01.320]  court in Weimar Germany's ruled that two schools should be prevented with
[3:31:01.320 --> 3:31:05.400]  immediate effect from forcing their pupils to wear masks along with imposing
[3:31:05.400 --> 3:31:10.280]  social distancing measures and insisting on COVID tests saying that the state
[3:31:10.280 --> 3:31:14.000]  legislative regulating this area has gotten far removed from the facts which
[3:31:14.000 --> 3:31:18.040]  has taken on seemingly historic proportions and what's interested about
[3:31:18.040 --> 3:31:25.040]  this is that they they bravely in a sense ruled out masks whatsoever as an
[3:31:25.040 --> 3:31:29.040]  instrument of preventing the spread of the infection not only that though they
[3:31:29.040 --> 3:31:34.640]  said masks were making the infections worse now you'll recall across European
[3:31:34.640 --> 3:31:38.720]  countries when France Italy Germany Spain the UK introduced these mask
[3:31:38.720 --> 3:31:44.280]  mandates at the end of the summer or even before the end of the summer in the
[3:31:44.280 --> 3:31:49.920]  case of Spain the cases the coronavirus cases shot up listen to what this
[3:31:49.920 --> 3:31:55.480]  German court concluded on the subject of face masks as the appraiser further
[3:31:55.480 --> 3:31:58.720]  explains every mask must be worn correctly in order to be effective in
[3:31:58.720 --> 3:32:03.560]  principal masks can become a contamination risk if touched on the
[3:32:03.560 --> 3:32:06.360]  one hand however they are not worn properly by the population and on the
[3:32:06.360 --> 3:32:10.520]  other hand they are very often touched with their hands goes on to say the
[3:32:10.520 --> 3:32:14.480]  population was not taught how to properly wear them goes on to say the
[3:32:14.480 --> 3:32:17.840]  population was virtually left alone with the masks the risk of infection is not
[3:32:17.840 --> 3:32:24.160]  only not reduced by wearing the mask but is increased by incorrect handling of
[3:32:24.160 --> 3:32:29.720]  the mass so they literally ruled in this court ruling in Germany that the masks
[3:32:29.720 --> 3:32:34.000]  not only don't stop the spread of the infection they're making coronavirus
[3:32:34.000 --> 3:32:38.560]  and they may close and we'll lay with back quick find the segment summit
[3:32:38.560 --> 3:32:49.680]  don't use the answer to 1984 is 1776

[3:34:55.280 --> 3:35:00.120]  and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world they have
[3:35:00.120 --> 3:35:06.360]  established absolute total despotism and dehumanization it is the western
[3:35:06.360 --> 3:35:11.480]  christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and then promoted women's
[3:35:11.480 --> 3:35:14.800]  rights and so much more that actually threatens them so because they can't
[3:35:14.800 --> 3:35:20.160]  defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside down and
[3:35:20.160 --> 3:35:26.640]  use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free

[3:35:47.120 --> 3:35:52.000]  promote free speech and freedom of association and they know that big tech
[3:35:52.000 --> 3:35:55.840]  is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive
[3:35:55.840 --> 3:35:59.080]  censorship and organized crime racketeering that's why they've been
[3:35:59.080 --> 3:36:03.080]  massively expanding their services so whether you have domains or want to
[3:36:03.080 --> 3:36:06.720]  register a domain or want help building a website or want servers or any other
[3:36:06.720 --> 3:36:10.520]  major service they've got it all and they're expanding and if you go to

[3:36:39.040 --> 3:36:43.800]  info wars domains.com take action now
[3:36:43.800 --> 3:36:50.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:36:54.840 --> 3:37:01.560]  transmitting worldwide from the summit.new studios in the united kingdom
[3:37:01.560 --> 3:37:07.040]  you're listening to Paul Joseph Watson
[3:37:07.440 --> 3:37:11.440]  we're gonna move on from covid and lockdown now because believe it or not
[3:37:11.440 --> 3:37:16.440]  there are still some other news stories happening in the world on of which is up
[3:37:16.440 --> 3:37:21.440]  on summit.news man radicalized by asian hate crime media propaganda attacks
[3:37:21.440 --> 3:37:27.040]  asian woman he mistakenly thought was white yes we have yet another example
[3:37:27.040 --> 3:37:32.720]  of someone acting out violently on a fake hate crime narrative that's been
[3:37:32.720 --> 3:37:38.280]  spun by the mainstream media in the context of asian hate crimes of course
[3:37:38.280 --> 3:37:43.400]  we've documented this vehemently over the past few months during which the
[3:37:43.400 --> 3:37:48.080]  media has tried to contrive a narrative that white people or white supremacy in
[3:37:48.080 --> 3:37:52.360]  general are responsible for a rise in hate crime attacks against asian
[3:37:52.360 --> 3:37:57.120]  americans now unfortunately when you look at the crime stats that narrative
[3:37:57.120 --> 3:38:03.680]  isn't borne out FBI statistics show that whereas whites comprised 62
[3:38:03.680 --> 3:38:08.920]  percent of the population in america they committed only 24 percent of crimes
[3:38:08.920 --> 3:38:16.000]  against asians in 2018 in comparison african americans who comprise 13% of
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:21.160]  the population committed 27.5% of all violent crimes against asian americans
[3:38:21.160 --> 3:38:26.760]  in 2018 so again they're less of the population significantly and yet they
[3:38:26.760 --> 3:38:32.160]  commit more violent crimes against asians in addition and this is documented
[3:38:32.160 --> 3:38:37.440]  in the link from this article out of the spate of recent high-profile hate crime
[3:38:37.440 --> 3:38:42.320]  attacks on asians virtually all the culprits are black males and you can
[3:38:42.320 --> 3:38:46.520]  go and click on the article and it goes through all the different examples the
[3:38:46.520 --> 3:38:52.040]  screenshots from the NYPD for example in the case of a black man who punched and
[3:38:52.040 --> 3:38:57.120]  kicked a 65 year old asian woman while making racist statements again you know
[3:38:57.120 --> 3:39:02.080]  white supremacy strikes again by the way that video shows that the individual
[3:39:02.080 --> 3:39:06.640]  inside the building where this happened right outside did nothing
[3:39:06.640 --> 3:39:12.360]  whatsoever to help the victim another instance a person violently beats up
[3:39:12.360 --> 3:39:16.360]  and punches an asian male in the head repeatedly in a Manhattan bound train
[3:39:16.360 --> 3:39:22.840]  the culprit was african-american white supremacy strikes again another example
[3:39:22.840 --> 3:39:27.720]  whoa Chinese lady ugly-ass chink an asian-american woman was subjected to a
[3:39:27.720 --> 3:39:33.520]  racist tirade on a bus in Miami culprit african-american male New York post
[3:39:33.520 --> 3:39:37.200]  tweets prosecutors probing subway attack on asian man as possible hate crime
[3:39:37.200 --> 3:39:43.120]  culprit african-american male this is a trend emerging and it ain't white
[3:39:43.120 --> 3:39:48.600]  supremacy what's funny about this though is that Eugene goo this blue checkmark
[3:39:48.600 --> 3:39:54.400]  doctor on Twitter said that black on asian crimes only occur because of our
[3:39:54.400 --> 3:39:58.720]  system of white supremacy so even when they're all being committed by african
[3:39:58.720 --> 3:40:05.920]  american males it's still white people's fault well now that fake narrative has
[3:40:05.920 --> 3:40:11.800]  borne our violence and crime in relation to a sexual assault at gunpoint which
[3:40:11.800 --> 3:40:17.640]  took place in where is this I think it's Los Angeles yes it knows Lake Forest
[3:40:17.640 --> 3:40:22.520]  California where a man who was radicalized by inaccurate media propaganda
[3:40:22.520 --> 3:40:26.120]  concerning a supposed wave of hate crimes targeting Asians blamed on white
[3:40:26.120 --> 3:40:30.840]  supremacy tried to take revenge by sexually assaulting a woman at gunpoint
[3:40:30.840 --> 3:40:34.960]  because he presumed she was white she wasn't even white by the way she was
[3:40:34.960 --> 3:40:39.440]  asian but who cares at this point she looks a bit white it must be to blame
[3:40:39.440 --> 3:40:44.680]  for something right let's rape her at gunpoint that's literally what was going
[3:40:44.680 --> 3:40:49.760]  through this guy's head because of what he saw on the mainstream media and they
[3:40:49.760 --> 3:40:57.080]  continually contrived this moral panic about white nationalism incentivizing
[3:40:57.080 --> 3:41:00.720]  violent crimes this is a clear example where they incentivize the violent
[3:41:00.720 --> 3:41:07.120]  crime there will be no consequences for their actions 37 year old Michael Sang
[3:41:07.120 --> 3:41:11.600]  Bongri was arrested by police in Lake Forest California after he allegedly
[3:41:11.600 --> 3:41:16.000]  attacked a woman who turned out to be asian quote in retaliation for the rise
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:21.120]  in hate crimes against asian people basically she was sitting in the
[3:41:21.120 --> 3:41:26.880]  driver's seat of her car she looked up to see this criminal standing at the
[3:41:26.880 --> 3:41:32.280]  door holding a handgun he then forced her to get into the back of the car
[3:41:32.280 --> 3:41:36.000]  started to grow per looked like he was preparing to rape her at gunpoint
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:40.800]  thankfully somebody else saw what was going on the victim struggled with
[3:41:40.800 --> 3:41:47.520]  Ri and she yelled to a maintenance worker that he had a gun so she got away
[3:41:47.520 --> 3:41:52.840]  thankfully without being seriously hurt or raped by the looks of it says
[3:41:52.840 --> 3:41:56.360]  detectives believe Ri who is Korean targeted the woman because he thought
[3:41:56.360 --> 3:42:00.320]  she was white based on his own statements and that the assault was in
[3:42:00.320 --> 3:42:05.080]  retaliation for hate crimes that have skyrocketed against Asian people now
[3:42:05.080 --> 3:42:09.840]  there's debate as to whether those crimes have skyrocketed I think there's
[3:42:09.840 --> 3:42:16.000]  been a slight uptick over the past year but even as Asian scholars have pointed
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:22.520]  out we've quotes I've included in these kind of articles in so-called high crime
[3:42:22.520 --> 3:42:26.080]  neighborhoods that's always been a massive problem it's just had a slight
[3:42:26.080 --> 3:42:30.680]  uptick this year and again the FBI stats show the all the high-profile recent
[3:42:30.680 --> 3:42:35.160]  examples show that that hate crime wave if it is happening against Asian people
[3:42:35.160 --> 3:42:40.480]  is not the fault of white people but in this case a white person was targeted
[3:42:40.480 --> 3:42:45.960]  for retribution because this violent criminal falsely bore into that fake
[3:42:45.960 --> 3:42:53.080]  narrative meanwhile white boy summer meme denounced as racist by actual
[3:42:53.080 --> 3:43:01.040]  racists so let me explain this one it's there's a lot to unpack here this is
[3:43:01.040 --> 3:43:07.240]  Chet Hanks who is the son of actor Tom Hanks and he's basically a failed
[3:43:07.240 --> 3:43:13.320]  rapper let's let's be let's be generous let's call him an aspiring rapper he
[3:43:13.320 --> 3:43:17.440]  put out a video a couple of weeks ago and he basically said I've got this
[3:43:17.440 --> 3:43:25.240]  feeling it's about to be a white boy summer now he was creating a meme as a
[3:43:25.240 --> 3:43:31.480]  silly marketing tool to sell white boy summer merchandise t-shirts hoodies and
[3:43:31.480 --> 3:43:35.840]  to put out a rap video which he's now released as of yesterday called white
[3:43:35.840 --> 3:43:42.120]  boy summer so it's a meme based on the Megan Thee Stallion song from 2019 which
[3:43:42.120 --> 3:43:48.160]  was called hot girl summer but of course immediately the leftist the mainstream
[3:43:48.160 --> 3:43:53.880]  media assumed because their moral panic requires that they assume everything
[3:43:53.880 --> 3:43:59.680]  that happens in the world now is a result of white supremacy despite mr.
[3:43:59.680 --> 3:44:03.200]  Hanks immediately clarifying that the whole thing had nothing to do with
[3:44:03.200 --> 3:44:10.080]  ethnicity it was just a stupid meme and it's a stupid marketing ploy but now
[3:44:10.080 --> 3:44:14.000]  it actually has been adopted by actual white supremacists because of the
[3:44:14.000 --> 3:44:19.600]  media's overreaction to it but Hanks himself said quote I'm not talking
[3:44:19.600 --> 3:44:24.840]  about trump nascar type white I'm talking about me rappers white boys you
[3:44:24.840 --> 3:44:28.560]  know what I mean he subsequently emphasized he was trying to spread an
[3:44:28.560 --> 3:44:33.320]  anti-racist message basically saying that everyone could embrace white boy
[3:44:33.320 --> 3:44:37.040]  summer he then laid out the rules for white boy summer which included not
[3:44:37.040 --> 3:44:42.560]  harassing women not getting in people's face with booze breath so he basically
[3:44:42.560 --> 3:44:48.040]  said it was an anti-racist thing and it was about respecting women but of course
[3:44:48.040 --> 3:44:52.880]  that was not good enough for the media who despite his many clarifications
[3:44:52.880 --> 3:44:58.480]  accused Hanks of racism anyway he launched a line of merchandise featuring
[3:44:58.480 --> 3:45:02.160]  the words white boy summer but was immediately accused of mimicking white
[3:45:02.160 --> 3:45:07.520]  supremacists because he used a gothic style font and yes in case you didn't
[3:45:07.520 --> 3:45:12.320]  get the memo as we highlighted a few days ago with CNN and Chinese style fonts
[3:45:12.320 --> 3:45:18.520]  fonts are now racist too so because a white person had the temerity to use a
[3:45:18.520 --> 3:45:25.400]  gothic style font a t-shirt designs this is yet another ominous sign of white
[3:45:25.400 --> 3:45:32.880]  supremacy run rampant he even designed a t-shirt with this chilling scary gothic
[3:45:32.880 --> 3:45:40.000]  font that said stop hate and wore it in the official white boy summer video which
[3:45:40.000 --> 3:45:45.640]  primarily consists of the rapper dancing with twerking women half of whom are
[3:45:45.640 --> 3:45:51.280]  black but again this is all about white supremacy the left-wing newspaper the
[3:45:51.280 --> 3:45:54.560]  Guardian said the type ofography was similar to the fracture fonts which
[3:45:54.560 --> 3:45:58.480]  were used in Nazi Germany most prominently on the cover of Hitler's
[3:45:58.480 --> 3:46:04.840]  mine camp book another Twitter user said the merch looks aggressively racist
[3:46:04.840 --> 3:46:09.440]  another one said that any cut any type of typeface that white people should
[3:46:09.440 --> 3:46:14.440]  avoid anything remotely caligraphic black letter looking pops immediately to
[3:46:14.440 --> 3:46:19.840]  mind especially if it's going to include the word white then we had a
[3:46:19.840 --> 3:46:25.320]  guardian columnist our mother Wadi who's worried that Hanks's dopey exploits
[3:46:25.320 --> 3:46:28.560]  will fuel racial thrive and she literally wrote an article with the
[3:46:28.560 --> 3:46:33.800]  headline chat Hanks keeps calling for a white boy so money really needs to stop
[3:46:33.800 --> 3:46:39.240]  so again this all goes back to the fact that the thing is just a dopey marketing
[3:46:39.240 --> 3:46:43.440]  gimmick has nothing to do with white supremacy this chair Hanks character is
[3:46:43.440 --> 3:46:49.640]  a complete idiot he's not smart enough even to tie it into that but again the
[3:46:49.640 --> 3:46:56.360]  point is he can't even refer to his own ethnicity in any other context than this
[3:46:56.360 --> 3:47:01.440]  self-loathing white guilt that's been impressed upon white people that we need
[3:47:01.440 --> 3:47:06.720]  to atone for our perceived historical sins he can't do that he can't even
[3:47:06.720 --> 3:47:09.920]  refer to his own ethnicity in anything other than a negative light without
[3:47:09.920 --> 3:47:14.720]  being accused of fueling racism any kind of relaxed confidence that he's
[3:47:14.720 --> 3:47:19.760]  comfortable in his own skin is strictly forbidden by a society that mandates
[3:47:19.760 --> 3:47:23.160]  white people constantly engage themselves in moral self-flagellation to
[3:47:23.160 --> 3:47:28.200]  atone for their supposed sins that's gonna wrap it up summit.news.warum is next
[3:47:28.200 --> 3:47:38.200]  Don't go away.
