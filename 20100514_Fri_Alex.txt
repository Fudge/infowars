[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.600 --> 00:19.160]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.160 --> 00:41.160]  Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen it is Friday the 14th day of May 2010 our
[00:41.160 --> 00:46.680]  article about the state of Texas and Governor Rick Perry who heads up the
[00:46.680 --> 00:53.200]  film commission gives him a lot of political power funding the racewar
[00:53.200 --> 00:57.840]  film machete is one of the top stories on drudge and is swamping info wars
[00:57.840 --> 01:04.600]  calm but our IT guys are battling to keep the site up right now but that
[01:04.600 --> 01:10.520]  article is now national news all over talk radio Washington Post you name it
[01:10.520 --> 01:16.000]  and that's why I've been hammering this since Sunday because that's how we punch
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.120]  through the mainstream media that's how we ram through the bulkhead and breach
[01:20.120 --> 01:25.360]  and get the information out to everybody and it's in a bunch of newspapers
[01:25.360 --> 01:31.640]  today not just the Washington Post but the drudge report and just countless
[01:31.640 --> 01:36.400]  other places so we definitely blew this wide open good job to all of the
[01:36.400 --> 01:40.960]  listeners ladies and gentlemen I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that
[01:40.960 --> 01:44.720]  today though okay we've done our job we've gotten the truth out about this
[01:44.720 --> 01:50.200]  and my uncle did call me last night and of course he speaks fluent Spanish
[01:50.200 --> 01:54.720]  lived and worked a lot in Latin America and he said have you seen the May issue
[01:54.720 --> 02:03.640]  of National Geographic and I said no I haven't and he gave me the title of the
[02:03.640 --> 02:10.760]  article about Mexico creating all these new saints and the most popular now it's
[02:10.760 --> 02:16.960]  it's more popular than than than Mary that in the Catholic religion is a saint
[02:17.960 --> 02:24.920]  and it's the grim reaper and it's what the drug dealers are into and it's about
[02:24.920 --> 02:28.720]  murder and death and everything else and that's basically from studying the
[02:28.720 --> 02:33.000]  sociology that's what's in machete that's what this is all about I mean this is
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.640]  like devil cult stuff I mean this is the Mexico is being swallowed by basically
[02:38.640 --> 02:44.200]  an evil spirit and a evil mindset I don't know what to call it I mean 20 plus
[02:44.200 --> 02:49.440]  thousand deaths 10 plus thousand in the last year murdered death kidnappings I
[02:49.440 --> 02:56.240]  mean it's just descending into hell and the Southwest is being pulled in and I
[02:56.240 --> 03:03.160]  just I was reading this article last night and it was so depressing it was so
[03:03.160 --> 03:07.120]  depressing to look at the photos of National Geographic and to read about
[03:07.120 --> 03:11.560]  it and even National Geographic was just stunned many families have like
[03:11.560 --> 03:15.720]  skeletons and the grim reaper and it's not day of the dead holiday stuff it's
[03:15.720 --> 03:21.720]  it's it's way way way past that and so the new saint being invented by Robert
[03:21.720 --> 03:26.960]  Rodriguez is machete he's prayed to above Christ he is God and he will murder
[03:26.960 --> 03:31.280]  the gringo and then that's why this is so dangerous ladies and gentlemen I mean
[03:31.280 --> 03:36.440]  this is demonic all the way and even if you don't believe in a physical
[03:36.440 --> 03:41.640]  Beelzebub you know humans through these art types manifest this okay I'm done
[03:41.640 --> 03:47.480]  I'm done talking about that if I have time later I'm gonna go over some of it
[03:49.720 --> 03:54.520]  it's all coming up yeah something hit me this morning driving into work though
[03:54.520 --> 03:59.480]  and I'm gonna cover when we come back and that is that we have been basting in
[03:59.480 --> 04:04.280]  the last three years in this depression this slow deepening depression and we've
[04:04.280 --> 04:08.480]  just become acclimated to economic crises even mainstream media has said
[04:08.480 --> 04:13.360]  we have bailout fatigue right now Sarcosia is threatening to pull out of
[04:13.360 --> 04:17.800]  the euro it will collapse all of Europe is on the verge of total financial
[04:17.800 --> 04:22.360]  collapse the United States is on the verge of financial collapse complete
[04:22.360 --> 04:25.680]  collapse I mean any day it could happen it could happen today it happened six
[04:25.680 --> 04:28.600]  months from now it could happen two years from now but there is no way to
[04:28.600 --> 04:32.720]  reverse the hyperinflation and what the banks have done okay so we're gonna talk
[04:32.720 --> 04:38.160]  about that we also have a surprise guest joining us in the next hour okay I'm
[04:38.160 --> 04:46.440]  just gonna leave it at that this is big big big news okay and that's coming up

[05:13.760 --> 05:17.040]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[05:17.040 --> 05:21.120]  again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect

[08:09.760 --> 08:20.720]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com have been up and down all morning long
[08:20.720 --> 08:26.800]  because of the mega traffic that both the sides are getting and so we're
[08:26.800 --> 08:30.560]  working on that but as we get more and more traffic it's basically like
[08:30.560 --> 08:35.920]  weightlifting it teaches us to tweak out the servers beef them up and our IT
[08:35.920 --> 08:41.840]  bill is over $400,000 a year and that's why I want to thank all the listeners
[08:41.840 --> 08:45.680]  to the syndicated radio broadcast we're not funded by the Ford Foundation or
[08:45.680 --> 08:50.240]  by the Texas Film Commission or by the CIA we're funded by you the American
[08:50.240 --> 08:55.480]  people this is the American people's radio network this is the GCN radio
[08:55.480 --> 09:01.440]  network this is info wars.com this is prisonplanet.com and we're also now
[09:01.440 --> 09:05.800]  posting the exclusive info wars.com and prisonplanet.com articles every day
[09:05.800 --> 09:13.440]  at GCN live.com as another mirror backup site so the information gets out one way
[09:13.440 --> 09:22.240]  or another there have been some behind-the-scenes repercussions because
[09:22.240 --> 09:26.000]  of my strong stance against the racism in the film machete in the racial
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.480]  division it creates but I hope that that can be cleared up before I have to take
[09:29.480 --> 09:33.320]  legal action it's just so much is happening as we become a bigger and
[09:33.320 --> 09:39.000]  bigger target we are on the cover of Radio Inc. the most influential talk
[09:39.000 --> 09:45.800]  radio publication for the industry we've got scores of affiliates new
[09:45.800 --> 09:50.160]  affiliates now calling in the last few days wanting to pick up the show so we
[09:50.160 --> 09:54.560]  have definitely broken through to a new level and so the attacks are going to
[09:54.560 --> 10:00.720]  intensify on this operation especially as everything we talked about and all of
[10:00.720 --> 10:05.080]  our expert guests have talked about comes true the credibility level no matter
[10:05.080 --> 10:09.840]  how radical and wild this broadcast sounds continues to be vindicated and
[10:09.840 --> 10:15.560]  borne out by things that are happening currently on the geopolitical scene the
[10:15.560 --> 10:19.160]  globalist have miscalculated for the last 50 years saying there's no world
[10:19.160 --> 10:23.480]  government private central banks don't have fractional reserve banking you know
[10:23.480 --> 10:27.000]  they're not engaged in a global takeover and now they're publicly saying it's a
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.720]  global takeover a world government for your own good and because we were there
[10:31.720 --> 10:35.520]  exposing them people out there fighting the new world order before I was even
[10:35.520 --> 10:39.800]  born 36 years ago and being laughed at and ridiculed and called names and set
[10:39.800 --> 10:44.920]  up and demonized and imprisoned because the great patriots of this nation of
[10:44.920 --> 10:49.720]  every race color and creed were telling the truth we now are in a fighting
[10:49.720 --> 10:54.440]  position we are now in a position to defeat these people if we take the
[10:54.440 --> 10:59.720]  initiative I just got chills when I said that because this is history that is
[10:59.720 --> 11:04.760]  unfolding right now all right here's the news president Nicolas Sarkozy
[11:04.760 --> 11:10.160]  threatens to pull out of France out of the euro president Nicolas Sarkozy
[11:10.160 --> 11:14.040]  threatens to pull France out of euro on the telegraph what did Webster Griffin
[11:14.040 --> 11:22.640]  sharply say on this radio show on Tuesday he said he's looking for Sarkozy to
[11:22.640 --> 11:28.200]  pull out right again just pointing out that the guest we have here have
[11:28.200 --> 11:34.680]  stunning analysis abilities just incredible so that's going on trilateral
[11:34.680 --> 11:37.400]  Commission wants war with Iran we're about to cover that in a moment you
[11:37.400 --> 11:40.480]  heard me right trilateral Commission wants war with Iran this dovetails with
[11:40.480 --> 11:47.080]  Reuters Israel prime for war with Iran Netanyahu if any idea what's gonna
[11:47.080 --> 11:52.440]  happen on that front US faces same problems as Greece says Bank of England

[12:21.600 --> 12:28.080]  news out and a the love police a kind of spinoff of we are change you know going
[12:28.080 --> 12:31.120]  into press conferences and pointing out that the election in England was totally
[12:31.120 --> 12:35.120]  rigged where all the candidates were basically selected by the globalist
[12:35.120 --> 12:40.560]  that made national news we are changing Dublin standing up to David Rockefeller
[12:40.560 --> 12:43.680]  pointing out he won't get his world government a week ago before they
[12:43.680 --> 12:48.640]  plunged Europe by design that that's made international news suggest
[12:48.640 --> 12:53.920]  devastating the enemy on every front by injecting the truth that the king has no
[12:53.920 --> 12:59.720]  clothes that the emperor is but naked but we have a prison planet calm article
[12:59.720 --> 13:03.720]  about this top story trilateral Commission once war with Iran
[13:03.720 --> 13:08.280]  trilateral Commission member unwittingly tells we are change activists of plans
[13:08.280 --> 13:15.640]  for world government this is so so important and up on prison planet calm
[13:15.640 --> 13:21.040]  and info wars dot com right now let's go to the head editor over at prison
[13:21.040 --> 13:26.960]  planet calm Paul Joseph Watson joining us from England Paul break this down for
[13:26.960 --> 13:34.160]  us yeah this is a report by Jim Tucker about the American free press about the
[13:34.160 --> 13:38.680]  recent tryout trilateral Commission meeting which took place last week in
[13:38.680 --> 13:44.640]  Dublin and as we know the trilateral Commission is the fifth
[13:44.640 --> 13:52.000]  the group to Bilderberg it's the entree to Bilderberg routinely happened about a
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.640]  month or three weeks before Bilderberg meet and they kind of set the agenda for
[13:56.640 --> 14:02.320]  what Bilderberg are going to discuss and because it's the less influential
[14:02.320 --> 14:07.160]  organization although it still has many of the same members the security around
[14:07.160 --> 14:11.560]  the trial actual Commission meetings is not as intense as it is at Bilderberg
[14:11.560 --> 14:18.040]  which is why as we saw earlier this week the sovereign independent group in
[14:18.040 --> 14:22.880]  Ireland were able to come from David Rockefeller who's the chairman of
[14:22.880 --> 14:27.520]  trilateral Commission both outside the building and inside the building where
[14:27.520 --> 14:33.000]  they were having dinner after one of their meetings so now we have this story
[14:33.000 --> 14:39.240]  which Tucker writes about today where a chief advisor to the rushing government
[14:39.240 --> 14:46.840]  Mikhail Slobodovsky was not confronted but just got into a conversation with a
[14:46.840 --> 14:54.600]  we are change Ireland member named Alan Keenan and this Russian Slobodovsky
[14:54.600 --> 14:59.880]  mistakenly thought he was talking to a fellow trilateral Commission member
[14:59.880 --> 15:04.600]  because he later mentioned the fact that he was under Chatham House rules which
[15:04.600 --> 15:10.200]  means they can't discuss anything outside their own inside circle but he
[15:10.200 --> 15:15.080]  fooled him how he did it I don't know obviously you probably get him on the
[15:15.080 --> 15:19.240]  show and he'll be able to go into it in more detail yeah we need what we're
[15:19.240 --> 15:23.080]  trying to contact different we are change groups over there this morning via
[15:23.080 --> 15:28.520]  your recommendation Paul continue but he got into a conversation with this
[15:28.520 --> 15:34.760]  trilateral member who basically told him and this is what took a quote quote we
[15:34.760 --> 15:40.160]  are deciding the future of the world we need a world government and referring to
[15:40.160 --> 15:46.360]  Iran he said quote we need to get rid of them then quote suddenly Slobodovsky
[15:46.360 --> 15:50.120]  noticed that Keenan's name tag was different from the TC label
[15:50.120 --> 15:55.000]  trilateral Commission label and said I can't talk we operate under Chatham House
[15:55.000 --> 16:00.520]  rules so he suddenly realized that he wasn't a fellow member and he he shut
[16:00.520 --> 16:06.680]  up pronto but just that revelation a that we're deciding the future of the
[16:06.680 --> 16:10.720]  world we need a world government and be again they're talking about a war with
[16:10.720 --> 16:17.920]  Iran is a an alarming revelation because as Tucker explains in the rest of the
[16:17.920 --> 16:22.960]  article and as we've seen unfolding over the past few weeks the their agenda to
[16:22.960 --> 16:27.760]  exploit the financial crisis to enact global government by posing as the
[16:27.760 --> 16:35.680]  saviors is failing the EU is collapsing we now have Paul Volcker the former Fed
[16:35.680 --> 16:41.720]  chairman as well as Romano Prody and as you said earlier Starco's e-threatening
[16:41.720 --> 16:47.360]  to quit the euro top financial expert Jim Rogers numerous others are saying
[16:47.360 --> 16:53.080]  that basically the euro is in big trouble today it's hit a low against the
[16:53.080 --> 16:57.360]  dollar that hasn't been seen seen since the collapse of layman brothers many
[16:57.360 --> 17:01.880]  people saying it's going to parity with the dollar which hasn't happened for
[17:01.880 --> 17:07.800]  roughly eight years and it's in big trouble and that matters because the
[17:07.800 --> 17:13.160]  euro was sold on the basis that an entire continent using one currency
[17:13.160 --> 17:17.840]  would provide stability but as we've seen with the situation in Greece the
[17:17.840 --> 17:22.520]  opposite has proven to be the case because when one country gets sick they
[17:22.520 --> 17:27.240]  all get sick it's contagious now we're talking about Portugal Spain and Italy
[17:27.240 --> 17:31.200]  going the same way as Greece they're gonna have massive debt burdens which
[17:31.200 --> 17:37.040]  they can't deal with so the whole European project is in trouble because
[17:37.040 --> 17:41.960]  current events have shown that it just doesn't work so the ultimate agenda to
[17:41.960 --> 17:47.680]  introduce the global bank a bank of the world allied to a global currency is in
[17:47.680 --> 17:53.200]  big trouble and that's what Tucker said other trilateral Commission members
[17:53.200 --> 17:58.840]  told his sources that were in there that quote it gets worse every year not
[17:58.840 --> 18:03.800]  better why do we even bother to meet anymore we can't simply give up and
[18:03.800 --> 18:08.280]  quit another responded Bilderberg expects us to have a plan outlined so
[18:08.280 --> 18:13.120]  trilateral Commission members Bilderberg members are really crest ball and
[18:13.120 --> 18:18.960]  they're downbeat because their model for economic global government is falling
[18:18.960 --> 18:27.360]  flat on its face and then there's another article today which I'm gonna write
[18:27.360 --> 18:34.640]  about after I get off the air Dominic Strathcarn the managing director of the
[18:34.640 --> 18:42.720]  IMF he said in a speech on May 11 three days ago quote finally in principle a
[18:42.720 --> 18:48.240]  new global currency issued by a global central bank with robust governance and
[18:48.240 --> 18:53.480]  institutional features could provide a nominal anchor and risk-free asset the
[18:53.480 --> 18:58.800]  system independent of national currencies this global central bank but
[18:58.800 --> 19:04.040]  also serve as a lender of last resort so they're still trying to push through
[19:04.040 --> 19:10.000]  this Bank of the World allied with a global currency even as the main model
[19:10.000 --> 19:15.400]  for pan-European currency which is a precursor to a global currency the
[19:15.400 --> 19:21.320]  euro completely collapses now we've talked many times about a bank of the
[19:21.320 --> 19:26.360]  world and how that will come into being and what it will look like while we had
[19:26.360 --> 19:32.280]  an indication I wrote an article about this on April 30th and basically the
[19:32.280 --> 19:37.320]  chief of the European Central Bank Jean-Claude Trichet came out in a speech
[19:37.320 --> 19:44.080]  to the CFR at the end of April and he said that the bank for international
[19:44.080 --> 19:49.320]  settlement would be the de facto global central bank which is alarming
[19:49.320 --> 19:55.320]  because the BIS was founded by Nazis let's finish up in one more segment on

[24:12.920 --> 24:16.760]  video David Rockefeller inside eating dinner they didn't get video of this
[24:16.760 --> 24:20.520]  unfortunately they infiltrated directly into the meeting just like I
[24:20.520 --> 24:25.080]  infiltrated Bohemian Grove people ask how can you do something like this guts
[24:25.080 --> 24:30.960]  is enough if you're willing to take action you will be successful most the
[24:30.960 --> 24:36.720]  time as real media to go in and ask real questions now the trial lateral
[24:36.720 --> 24:40.480]  Commission is made up of the central bankers it's a private meeting house of
[24:40.480 --> 24:46.840]  the financiers that actually captain the top echelon of the Bilderberg group here
[24:46.840 --> 24:52.440]  it is Israel primed for war with Iran Reuters here's another one Russia warns
[24:52.440 --> 24:57.480]  us against unilateral Iran sanctions that looks like Russia's been softening to
[24:57.480 --> 25:02.600]  the attack on Iran in the news so that would dovetail with this information
[25:02.600 --> 25:06.560]  continuing as we got cut off by the break you were talking about the central
[25:06.560 --> 25:11.120]  bankers have said they want a new global constitution outgoing head of England
[25:11.120 --> 25:16.120]  Gordon Brown has said that as well run by this particular central banking arm
[25:16.120 --> 25:22.360]  go ahead yeah what they've called for is a global central bank that issues a
[25:22.360 --> 25:28.840]  global currency and John Claude Trichet at the end of April in a CFR speech said
[25:28.840 --> 25:34.720]  that it would be run basically by the BIS which is the Bank for International
[25:34.720 --> 25:40.120]  Settlement the directors of the BIS are Ben Bernanke
[25:40.120 --> 25:45.280]  Nervin King who is the chief of the Bank of England as well as Trichet
[25:45.280 --> 25:49.720]  himself who is the director of the European Central Bank so it's basically
[25:49.720 --> 25:55.120]  an organization that's purely made up of global central bankers and they're the
[25:55.120 --> 25:59.400]  ones who are going to rule the global economy through a single currency but
[25:59.400 --> 26:05.240]  what's more even more alarming than that is if you trace the history of the Bank
[26:05.240 --> 26:10.360]  for International Settlement and this is documented in Charles Himes book called
[26:10.360 --> 26:14.680]  trading with the enemy how the allied multinational supply net the Germany
[26:14.680 --> 26:20.720]  Stroud World War two and basically the BIS was used by the Nazis who controlled
[26:20.720 --> 26:26.480]  it people like it was finance minister people who were Herman Schmidt the
[26:26.480 --> 26:33.120]  director I.G. Farben was also one of the directors of the BIS as it was Baron
[26:33.120 --> 26:38.920]  von Schroeder who helped organize and hold the deposit of the Gestapo in this
[26:38.920 --> 26:46.200]  bank so it was it was run by Nazis in collaboration with American industrialist
[26:46.200 --> 26:51.120]  at the time now Paul don't talk bad about Nazis in the EU and the first
[26:51.120 --> 26:55.440]  Bilderberg meeting admitting it was a second Nazi takeover or the Southern
[26:55.440 --> 26:58.800]  Poverty Law Center will call you a racist you do not talk bad about the
[26:58.800 --> 27:05.440]  Nazis bankers okay that's that's not right well exactly but every every stone
[27:05.440 --> 27:10.920]  you uncover related to the European Union and how it got started and how
[27:10.920 --> 27:15.440]  Bilderberg got started you'll find a Nazi they were all on the team to begin
[27:15.440 --> 27:20.080]  to begin with because the central banks that run the world and ran the world
[27:20.080 --> 27:25.400]  then funded both sides of World War two at the start it looked like Hitler was
[27:25.400 --> 27:29.760]  going to win World War two so they were financing Hitler's war machine through
[27:29.760 --> 27:35.600]  the BIS which is now going to be a new global central bank and basically it's
[27:35.600 --> 27:40.800]  the same people today that are using this institution to centralize power into
[27:40.800 --> 27:45.200]  their own hands and to try to achieve their world government and if they can't
[27:45.200 --> 27:51.760]  do it by exploiting the economic crisis that they created then from this
[27:51.760 --> 27:56.200]  Trial Actual Commission leak it looks like they're going to go down the even
[27:56.200 --> 28:01.360]  more desperate route which is by starting a war with Iran which of course
[28:01.360 --> 28:06.280]  could quite possibly lead to World War three
[28:06.280 --> 28:10.800]  meanwhile the general public are talking about basketball finals they're
[28:10.800 --> 28:16.560]  talking about Michelle Obama's exercise routine in the garden she's got in the
[28:16.560 --> 28:22.280]  backyard and openly Sarkozy's talking about pulling out of the Euro I mean
[28:22.280 --> 28:27.880]  this is incredible I mean we're seeing history unfold right now the entire
[28:27.880 --> 28:33.840]  financial market could collapse at any time and it's like we're tied to railroad
[28:33.840 --> 28:39.120]  tracks here Paul trying to warn the public yeah and the big thing I keep
[28:39.120 --> 28:45.560]  reading about is that there's gonna be a property market real estate crash in
[28:45.560 --> 28:51.200]  China starting before the end of the year and top financial experts have said
[28:51.200 --> 28:57.560]  that if China goes down then it's gonna take the Dow down to below 5,000 I mean
[28:57.560 --> 29:01.600]  that yeah I was telling a yuppie the other day that China 90% chance
[29:01.600 --> 29:05.680]  according to Farber and others that have had a good track record is gonna go
[29:05.680 --> 29:09.760]  down in the next year and they just laughed and said good you know there
[29:09.760 --> 29:13.240]  are competition they don't understand China is the biggest holder of our debt
[29:13.240 --> 29:16.640]  and most our manufacturing has done there you know there's this ingrained
[29:16.640 --> 29:20.680]  thing in the public to say oh good someone else is gonna have a problem
[29:20.680 --> 29:27.520]  that'll help me no that's not how this works well everything I mean to be
[29:27.520 --> 29:32.200]  invested in the stock market and not know that it's all about confidence in the
[29:32.200 --> 29:37.360]  global economy is just beyond stupidity if China goes down I mean you know they've
[29:37.360 --> 29:42.760]  got double-digit growth every year but then to be going through a recession is

[35:48.600 --> 35:51.760]  of you for the earth and everyone will march in and the globalist will sit
[35:51.760 --> 35:57.640]  around laughing you think that's a joke that's the plan okay so go ahead and
[35:57.640 --> 36:02.120]  laugh okay go ahead it's real funny and then everything else is real funny now
[36:02.120 --> 36:05.200]  it's so dangerous the globalist are debating when they should launch this
[36:05.200 --> 36:10.040]  and they're beta testing just regular vaccines that are delivered via nanotech
[36:10.040 --> 36:15.960]  I just can't even handle it anymore it's 2010 it's buck Rogers they went to the
[36:15.960 --> 36:23.800]  moon in the 60s they tell you the fastest plan in the world the SR 71 blackbird in
[36:23.800 --> 36:32.840]  service in 1955 55 years ago baloney baloney the technology we're allowed to
[36:32.840 --> 36:36.920]  have and we're given is 25 to 30 years old depending on what type of technology
[36:36.920 --> 36:40.880]  some of it's 50 years old the space shuttle was designed by the Nazis in
[36:40.880 --> 36:52.720]  1935 that's documented my mother and uncle in Austin Texas when they were
[36:52.720 --> 36:57.560]  little kids were taken to see Werner von Braun as a type of guy my grandfather
[36:57.560 --> 37:03.560]  was he would take them to UT lectures talk about the space shuttle in the late
[37:03.560 --> 37:09.200]  50s all right I'm gonna shut up let's go back to Watson Watson other points on
[37:09.200 --> 37:14.440]  this issue I mean it's open world government open banking takeover
[37:14.440 --> 37:19.280]  nation's completely collapsing into economic bondage the euro on the verge
[37:19.280 --> 37:23.080]  of completely imploding a trillion wasn't enough now they want trillions
[37:23.080 --> 37:28.240]  more we're totally held hostage the general public knows something's wrong
[37:28.240 --> 37:32.800]  but they don't have one one millionth how bad it is other key points on the
[37:32.800 --> 37:36.400]  situation it looks like they're planning to try to launch war in the next six
[37:36.400 --> 37:40.880]  months on Iran's on the front burner now that's the perfect political smoke
[37:40.880 --> 37:44.920]  screen foreign economic implosion out of the global crisis will be born the
[37:44.920 --> 37:52.080]  open public carbon tax one child policy tyranny and we pray the globalists only
[37:52.080 --> 37:59.280]  decide to one child policy us and decide these super viruses aren't released on
[37:59.280 --> 38:07.960]  us Watson go ahead well every time they try to exploit a crisis to get global
[38:07.960 --> 38:15.320]  government they seem to be failing I mean they tried it with the global warming that's collapsing and trying it with the
[38:15.320 --> 38:21.680]  economic situation that doesn't seem to be working out what the EU is trying to do
[38:21.680 --> 38:27.440]  now is exploit a crisis within a crisis they're saying they need to create a
[38:27.440 --> 38:33.040]  European monetary fund and they're basically saying that the stop situations
[38:33.040 --> 38:40.120]  like Greece the EU now directly has to control every aspect of financial policy
[38:40.120 --> 38:46.360]  of each member nation so whereas before it was just a monetary union of course the
[38:46.360 --> 38:52.400]  EU controls a lot of laws related to social issues in many European countries
[38:52.400 --> 38:56.680]  including Britain but now they're saying that they directly want to control the
[38:56.680 --> 39:01.840]  national economies of member states so again they're exploiting a crisis to
[39:01.840 --> 39:07.680]  centralize power into fewer hands revealing again that the EU by its very
[39:07.680 --> 39:14.720]  nature is inherently undemocratic and fascist well what did the foreign news
[39:14.720 --> 39:17.880]  editor of the Financial Times of London say a year and a half ago with this
[39:17.880 --> 39:22.080]  headline and now for world government he said it's been covert we built it in
[39:22.080 --> 39:26.840]  secret it's authoritarian for your own good you're too stupid to understand it
[39:26.840 --> 39:31.080]  what did the head of the Gaia movement say to the BBC the head of the global
[39:31.080 --> 39:34.560]  environmental movement even bigger than Gore he said a month ago the public's
[39:34.560 --> 39:39.000]  too stupid we must have global government authoritarian system what does John
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.720]  P. Holdren say the White House science are this is it and they say we're
[39:43.720 --> 39:48.200]  stupid scum the future doesn't belong to us and we are basically the enemy and
[39:48.200 --> 39:52.280]  they are just totally taking over right now and you know the public's listening
[39:52.280 --> 39:56.400]  right now snickering and giggling about viruses that brain damage you and make
[39:56.400 --> 40:00.160]  you servile they're already spiking your water with chemical weapons to brain
[40:00.160 --> 40:05.240]  damage you you better wake up folks and realize your white supremacist garbage
[40:05.240 --> 40:09.040]  doesn't matter your your black supremacist garbage doesn't matter your
[40:09.040 --> 40:14.480]  La Raza federally funded garbage doesn't matter it's all complete crud none of it
[40:14.480 --> 40:20.760]  matters we're all under attack by the global scientific dictatorship 110%
[40:20.760 --> 40:27.000]  red alert red alert red alert I mean it's just it doesn't have to happen if
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.280]  people wake up to this now but the globalists are arrogant because they're
[40:31.280 --> 40:36.240]  planning to accelerate their operations we're already seeing this and I just hope
[40:36.240 --> 40:41.360]  people know that you are in a science fiction nightmare situation and you must
[40:41.360 --> 40:45.600]  break your conditioning and fully tune into the reality of what's going on
[40:45.600 --> 40:52.040]  Watson I need you I'll give you a prime directive here on air I've had you on the
[40:52.040 --> 40:55.000]  financial situation other things you're doing an incredible job some days
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.840]  writing five six articles same thing with your brother Steve Watson then they
[40:57.840 --> 41:02.400]  would curtain ammo Aaron Dykes all the great crew up here but I tell you now
[41:02.400 --> 41:07.600]  we I have the aggregate some knowledge but I've been so busy I haven't focused
[41:07.600 --> 41:13.800]  on this properly I need you to do deep data searches I believe it was the
[41:13.800 --> 41:24.440]  Baltimore Sun in 2001 right before 9-11 reported what we'd already seen in
[41:24.440 --> 41:29.240]  DARPA documents that the federal government was developing mine control
[41:29.240 --> 41:34.520]  towers in every major city to put out different energy waves that they found
[41:34.520 --> 41:41.360]  are welcome make you become nauseous make you become comative anything they
[41:41.360 --> 41:45.160]  want of course now they have the sound cannons the microwave guns law
[41:45.160 --> 41:53.200]  enforcement magazines sell the sonic nausea machine the super nausea I'm
[41:53.200 --> 41:55.600]  giving the exact names right now for everybody we need to put this together
[41:55.600 --> 41:59.200]  and it talks about putting them in jail cells to make people sick openly this is
[41:59.200 --> 42:04.240]  publicly sold in show more tech was it's covered in road to tyranny and that's
[42:04.240 --> 42:08.720]  just an example of these torture devices it talks about disrupting political
[42:08.720 --> 42:13.360]  rallies secretly with them and they have systems that can make whole crowds sick
[42:13.360 --> 42:18.320]  or just one person that you can aim at them the Kokomo hum with a mind control
[42:18.320 --> 42:24.560]  test ABC news that's another key data point if you search engine the term
[42:24.560 --> 42:27.440]  then you got to go to the actual research papers that we've read on air over
[42:27.440 --> 42:31.840]  the years but a piece here a piece there you can I'm shifting gears and it's just
[42:31.840 --> 42:35.720]  total mind control for a moment a chemical and biological mind control more
[42:35.720 --> 42:42.520]  than mind control mind mind reengineering mind brain damage mind takeover the way
[42:42.520 --> 42:47.520]  they push it is new vaccine to cure cocaine use cocaine addiction new
[42:47.520 --> 42:52.280]  vaccine to cure alcohol addiction new vaccine to cure nicotine addiction and
[42:52.280 --> 42:58.240]  then those classes and families generally operate off of a live virus
[42:58.240 --> 43:04.240]  that is programmed to only like to eat certain neurons and they could be
[43:04.240 --> 43:07.240]  tailored and then this is what they admit they've had this for 20 years but
[43:07.240 --> 43:10.560]  this is what they admit they have it's much more advanced and then it goes in
[43:10.560 --> 43:21.000]  and literally eats the the key ganglia connections neuron jumbles in areas of
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.360]  the brain targeted and that's what viruses do naturally occurring you know
[43:25.360 --> 43:28.680]  only eat certain things only attack certain tissues only replicate in
[43:28.680 --> 43:36.280]  certain cell types with their RNA injector ports and so then you can go
[43:36.280 --> 43:39.680]  to the actual papers where the doctors and scientists saying this is dangerous
[43:39.680 --> 43:44.320]  because when they destroy these neurons those are natural neurons you have
[43:44.320 --> 43:52.400]  these uptake points for endorphins for all of these hundreds and hundreds of
[43:52.400 --> 43:57.840]  different combinations released by the pituitary by the hypothalamus by the
[43:57.840 --> 44:07.280]  thyroid by the pancreas by the liver by the bone marrow and that it all is
[44:07.280 --> 44:11.920]  basically interacts to give you the species that is homo sapien sapien
[44:11.920 --> 44:19.000]  homo erectus sapien sapien and this more and more I realize this is the key when
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.000]  I saw this devastatingly evil report and of course we have Bill Gates laughing
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.640]  about we've got a vaccinate everyone to cut the population we've got to have
[44:25.640 --> 44:30.040]  zero carbon footprint the best way to do it is cut humans in that Ted TV piece
[44:30.040 --> 44:35.920]  and then they have another Ted TV piece with the top globalist saying that
[44:35.920 --> 44:40.920]  we need the Chinese system or their DNA testing everyone at birth to
[44:40.920 --> 44:44.080]  decide what they're going to be when they grow up the brave new world is all
[44:44.080 --> 44:47.600]  this Huxley said written in 1933 his brother the future head of the UN
[44:47.600 --> 44:50.560]  UNESCO program the head of the eugenics Foundation and the founder of the
[44:50.560 --> 44:55.760]  transhumanist movement you know said this is our actual plan for you by 2000 in
[44:55.760 --> 45:04.320]  his 1962 Berkeley California speech at Berkeley here it is Gates Foundation
[45:04.320 --> 45:08.280]  researches nanoparticle vaccines triggered by sweat this is from the
[45:08.280 --> 45:13.320]  Bill and Linda Gates Foundation Foundation funds 78 new innovative global
[45:13.320 --> 45:17.800]  health projects including cell phone blood tests carnivorous plants and sweat
[45:17.800 --> 45:23.040]  triggered vaccines and in here yeah well he's done the famous thing also on Ted
[45:23.040 --> 45:26.960]  TV where he released the mosquitoes in the crowd and said I'm going to put
[45:26.960 --> 45:30.600]  vaccines in them and they talk about how the public won't take vaccines now
[45:30.600 --> 45:34.400]  we're gonna have pharmacological engineered crops that deliver it to you
[45:34.400 --> 45:41.440]  these these reprogramming vaccines are one of the most dangerous issues we face
[45:41.440 --> 45:47.560]  and it was actually a Hollywood movie I didn't get a chance to see it but it's
[45:47.560 --> 45:51.760]  the actor who's in Shawshank Redemption and also the producer what's his name
[45:51.760 --> 45:57.280]  guys the guy that plays Andy in the Shawshank Redemption
[45:57.280 --> 46:03.680]  Tim Robbins we've got a Tim Robbins science fiction film about engineered
[46:03.680 --> 46:07.960]  viruses for mind control again the reason I want to see that film is I can
[46:07.960 --> 46:10.960]  then promote it and have people get an idea and it's locked down compact
[46:10.960 --> 46:14.640]  cities brain damaged servile groups that were programmed by the vaccine
[46:14.640 --> 46:20.200]  releases I already knew this was the plan before I read the synopsis on IMDB for
[46:20.200 --> 46:23.440]  whatever that movie was in the movie was a complete failure and I think went
[46:23.440 --> 46:27.000]  straight to DVD Watson I'm sorry to be ranting it's just that I'm beginning to
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.200]  realize they're so far ahead of us in this game I at least want to put out an
[46:31.200 --> 46:34.920]  emergency transmission they could launch this at any time and it'll spread all
[46:34.920 --> 46:40.000]  over as a virus and suddenly you know before you get the headache and become
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.680]  a brain damaged zombie you'll be able to see it happening to your neighbors and
[46:43.680 --> 46:47.000]  perhaps flee or something so I mean I mean this could happen any time Watson do
[46:47.000 --> 46:54.200]  you see what I'm saying yeah the thing about Gates was I mean this this Ted
[46:54.200 --> 47:00.440]  conference is $6,000 just to be in attendance so you know who his audience
[47:00.440 --> 47:03.800]  is when he's talking to him and that's why they laugh when he says we've got to
[47:03.800 --> 47:08.880]  get rid of half the people they oh yeah they get off on the power trip oh we
[47:08.880 --> 47:12.920]  won't be given the shots we won't we're gonna live we're yeah I'm sorry go ahead
[47:12.920 --> 47:17.560]  they think they're part of it and he said if we do a really great job on new
[47:17.560 --> 47:23.120]  vaccines healthcare and reproductive health services meaning abortion we
[47:23.120 --> 47:27.560]  to lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent they're talking about vaccines
[47:27.560 --> 47:32.400]  which is supposed to cure diseases in principle that would lower the global
[47:32.400 --> 47:39.120]  population by 10 to 15 percent how can that work unless it's the vaccines doing
[47:39.120 --> 47:46.280]  it and then he said that he wanted to find a vaccine that would be used to
[47:46.280 --> 47:52.480]  lower global co2 emissions now how can you do that we emit co2 when we exhale
[47:52.480 --> 47:56.120]  so how else can that be possible and they all laugh because they're all little
[47:56.120 --> 48:00.400]  petty globalist who pay money to go hear this and it's about it's it's it's
[48:00.400 --> 48:04.800]  about we're the gang we're here openly telling people we're gonna wipe them out
[48:04.800 --> 48:09.160]  and to hear the demonic snickering and giggling and Gates getting that demonic
[48:09.160 --> 48:14.200]  look in his eyes his father CIA Pentagon intelligence former board member of
[48:14.200 --> 48:17.840]  Planned Parenthood it's just they just love it they just love the devastating
[48:17.840 --> 48:24.120]  power they've got whoa I'm sorry go ahead even though the UN's own
[48:24.120 --> 48:30.000]  population report which I've read and wrote articles about say that global
[48:30.000 --> 48:37.080]  population gets to about nine billion by 2050 and then it quite rapidly you know
[48:37.080 --> 48:43.280]  goes back down to four or five billion and I mean that would be the case if
[48:43.280 --> 48:48.600]  if all these third world countries were allowed to follow the same course as the
[48:48.600 --> 48:53.080]  Western countries have done but once you add into the equation this zero carbon
[48:53.080 --> 48:56.880]  economy in this post-industrial revolution that they've hopefully
[48:56.880 --> 49:01.640]  announced they're gonna keep the third world as the third world and that's why
[49:01.640 --> 49:05.480]  they're gonna see population levels drive up and then these vaccines are
[49:05.480 --> 49:13.560]  gonna come into solve the problem in their eyes but it's far past that I mean
[49:13.560 --> 49:17.880]  do they admit that they're coming out and quote testing was probably in the
[49:17.880 --> 49:21.440]  flu shot we know they've been caught spiking with cancer viruses you name it
[49:21.440 --> 49:27.280]  before they're coming out with vaccines engineered into the sweet potato into
[49:27.280 --> 49:30.960]  the rice you can pull up the articles about you know company patents rice that
[49:30.960 --> 49:36.200]  sterilizes men and they're already testing all of this on us and I just it's
[49:36.200 --> 49:40.080]  such an evil to rob people of their consciousness you know with the fluoride
[49:40.080 --> 49:43.680]  with the poison but that's just intoxication to actually go in and
[49:43.680 --> 49:47.840]  release viruses into the brain and be promoting it like oh you're gonna feel
[49:47.840 --> 49:51.040]  much better now you know just you literally just go to sleep it's like
[49:51.040 --> 49:54.560]  the body snatchers and when you wake up you're gonna feel much better I mean
[49:54.560 --> 49:57.920]  this is just the total takeover and then the public's laughing and they just
[49:57.920 --> 50:01.760]  want it and it's all funny and the depression's funny and the open borders
[50:01.760 --> 50:05.680]  are funny and the destruction is funny and and all that matters is basketball
[50:05.680 --> 50:12.360]  and acting cool and so just I just have children and I'm angry that the system
[50:12.360 --> 50:16.360]  is trying to pass laws not affordably inject them and it's just it's just
[50:16.360 --> 50:22.720]  hell on earth Watson but I mean how far away are we from a idiocracy type
[50:22.720 --> 50:27.840]  situation I don't think without far away from it whenever you go out
[50:27.840 --> 50:34.120]  and see a movie it's just so bass and banal and you know the lowest common
[50:34.120 --> 50:38.240]  denominator that we're basically on the brink of that situation now with a large
[50:38.240 --> 50:43.080]  portion of the population yeah they're under mind control from TV and chemicals
[50:43.080 --> 50:47.600]  but the war is about to get a thousand times worse against us and I just want
[50:47.600 --> 50:51.480]  everybody to know Watson great job over at presentplanet.com we'll come back and
[50:51.480 --> 50:56.200]  get into other global news and the latest developments on Machete I'm Alex
[50:56.200 --> 51:01.720]  Jones trying to raise the alarm worldwide emergency situation hi this is
[51:01.720 --> 51:05.640]  Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[51:05.640 --> 51:09.160]  and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real
[51:09.160 --> 51:13.200]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's
[51:13.200 --> 51:16.640]  true seeds about perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[51:16.640 --> 51:20.560]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science
[51:20.560 --> 51:24.640]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a
[51:24.640 --> 51:29.560]  survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food
[51:29.560 --> 51:33.120]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[51:33.120 --> 51:37.200]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[51:37.200 --> 51:42.160]  acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com that's
[51:42.160 --> 51:48.320]  survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365
[51:48.320 --> 51:56.480]  that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the
[51:56.480 --> 52:01.880]  ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com they help to
[52:01.880 --> 52:07.160]  create a new world order we are part of a new world order a new world order based
[52:07.160 --> 52:12.280]  upon collective action invisible empire is a damning indictment of the globalists

[54:01.480 --> 54:19.320]  Danny Trejo who plays machete has lived in Austin off and on and I'm told is a
[54:19.320 --> 54:23.920]  really nice guy did serve time reportedly for armed robbery in prison as a
[54:23.920 --> 54:30.600]  boxing trainer so he is a tough guy and you know I don't like having to come
[54:30.600 --> 54:34.320]  out and criticize a film like machete but I saw the trailer saying a message
[54:34.320 --> 54:38.400]  for Arizona racially charged very dangerous with the depression Mexico
[54:38.400 --> 54:43.000]  imploding all the calls for violence by legal alien groups and you know that's
[54:43.000 --> 54:47.040]  why I've been trying to point out that hey this looks dangerous and then before
[54:47.040 --> 54:50.920]  I talked about it I didn't want to go off half-cocked I got contacted by members
[54:50.920 --> 54:55.560]  of Robert Rodriguez's crew or Hispanic who were concerned about it they said
[54:55.560 --> 54:59.800]  we're worried about a backlash against Hispanics you know bottom line I'm
[54:59.800 --> 55:03.520]  probably at a certain level people pointed out I hadn't thought about that
[55:03.520 --> 55:07.040]  actually helping the film with the huge promotion it's now getting and the
[55:07.040 --> 55:10.600]  Washington Post and the drudge report and everywhere else just that I have the
[55:10.600 --> 55:19.480]  script and it is worse than what we even first thought and as long as there's a
[55:19.480 --> 55:23.240]  debate about it and as long as people as long as they come out and say this is
[55:23.240 --> 55:27.040]  art because see when they made it a message to Arizona and it shot at the
[55:27.040 --> 55:31.480]  Texas Capitol and about politicians and about you know white people wanting to
[55:31.480 --> 55:35.200]  kill Hispanics everywhere as long as they come out and say this is just a movie we
[55:35.200 --> 55:38.440]  don't think this is real then it wouldn't be as bad but they're basically
[55:38.440 --> 55:44.000]  saying this is real this is a political message I'm I want unity I don't like
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.240]  having to get up here and you know get into all this because we've got so many
[55:48.240 --> 55:53.280]  other things to deal with you know I'm the guy who constantly rancid raves about
[55:53.280 --> 55:56.640]  getting the Planned Parenthoods out of the Hispanic and black neighborhoods
[55:56.640 --> 55:59.640]  that's where almost all of them are and I the founder of Planned Parenthood
[55:59.640 --> 56:02.760]  hated brown people and said that she wanted to get rid of them and called
[56:02.760 --> 56:08.520]  them garbage and weeds Margaret Sanger see see I actually don't like it that
[56:08.520 --> 56:14.480]  51 almost 52% of blacks were never born since 1973 see where are the black
[56:14.480 --> 56:19.920]  leaders criticizing that and that tens of millions of Hispanics in Mexico and the
[56:19.920 --> 56:26.520]  US are being aborted and it's horrible you know I I don't want you to die I
[56:26.520 --> 56:30.920]  don't want you to be killed I love everybody but then you know all these
[56:30.920 --> 56:34.360]  quote liberals go don't talk about abortion you know just just just you
[56:34.360 --> 56:38.760]  know you're an evil gringo you know this is the idea their foundation funded
[56:38.760 --> 56:43.080]  the eugenicist want to control you so they come in and create racial division
[56:43.080 --> 56:49.160]  and poses your friends especially as a democratic party and then the Republican
[56:49.160 --> 56:54.160]  party puts out racial garbage as well that adds to all of this so they can
[56:54.160 --> 57:04.600]  manipulate everybody so ladies and gentlemen it's it's mind control I study
[57:04.600 --> 57:10.280]  this I understand it and I have seen sections of the 1993 script by Robert
[57:10.280 --> 57:15.360]  Rodriguez about machete that has nothing to do with race and killing and
[57:15.360 --> 57:19.640]  division and white people trying to kill Hispanic children and murdering
[57:19.640 --> 57:24.000]  priests and desecrating churches and so I think he was you know encouraged and
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.560]  then and was out of just calling I probably don't want to talk to me now
[57:28.560 --> 57:35.440]  though this is a big national story it needs to be a big national story and it
[57:35.440 --> 57:39.200]  just disgusts me I mean here is the Washington Post fear of racial jihad
[57:39.200 --> 57:45.520]  from Robert Rodriguez that's the Washington Post deadline drudge has it
[57:45.520 --> 57:52.640]  as one of their top stories as well with a link to our article Hollywood plans
[57:52.640 --> 57:56.440]  race war movie well they they don't plan it they've they've already shot it and
[57:56.440 --> 58:04.480]  was done with taxpayer funds and you know I just don't even know what to say
[58:04.480 --> 58:09.040]  anymore I mean if there was a movie coming out where Hispanics were the bad
[58:09.040 --> 58:13.880]  people running around murdering whites I would be absolutely as vehement
[58:13.880 --> 58:18.400]  against it because of the backlash against white people and Hispanics
[58:18.400 --> 58:21.920]  either way you do this if you have the white people as bad guys it causes a
[58:21.920 --> 58:25.560]  backlash if you have the Mexicans as the bad guys it causes a backlash can't you
[58:25.560 --> 58:28.680]  see that I mean they keep demonizing the Tea Party saying we're gonna cause
[58:28.680 --> 58:31.720]  violence we're not even calling for it and then meanwhile this comes out and
[58:31.720 --> 58:35.080]  they say oh it's just a movie well it isn't just a movie it's a message to
[58:35.080 --> 58:40.280]  Arizona so they've got to depoliticize it right now and then it will be just a

[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:25.900]  you Wow we're to start I was here with Tim's to make very from July 1999 until
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:32.980]  his execution in June of 2001 I had numerous conversations with them over
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:37.700]  that prolonged period of time and we made an agreement for him to provide
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:43.060]  information to me that could be verified in order for me to write a book he knew
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:48.100]  of my intentions to write a book about him and don't call the city bombing and
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:52.180]  along the way he would provide me information and I would provide it to
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:57.180]  people on the outside to try and verify as much as they could the results of
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:03.260]  that is my most recent book called Deadly Secrets McVeigh told me and another
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:09.260]  inmate here that he was actually an agent working for a guy he called the
[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:16.700]  major and he met this allegedly met this man when he reported to for special
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:23.700]  training's duty and he was told to wash out a special training and asked to
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:29.100]  accept what was called black ops operations and he would be working as
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:34.460]  as an independent person as a part of and that he would recruit people to be in
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:41.540]  his unit according to McVeigh this association went on for several years
[01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:49.580]  from the end of 1993 nice night excuse me 1992 and throughout the day of the
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:55.460]  bombing of the Merrill building on April 19th 1995 the person he identified
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:12:03.220]  as the major also provided financing for the Oklahoma City bombing at least
[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:10.860]  $60,000 over a two-year period of time during the week leading up to the to the
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:17.780]  bombing McVeigh was in debt with this individual and the person that he the
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:21.980]  person that the major had selected for me to work with McVeigh to actually build
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:26.860]  the bomb and according to McVeigh they built the bomb that blew up the Merrill
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:34.740]  building at a warehouse in Oklahoma City on the on the 18th of April of 1995 now
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:40.740]  now to be clear Terry Nichols has signed a sworn affidavit also and that
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:45.860]  that McVeigh told him he was black ops McVeigh was also videotaped this has
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:48.980]  been covered by national news a year after he was supposedly at the military
[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:56.620]  at a demolitions base and of course also Jesse trying to do and others have
[01:12:56.620 --> 01:13:02.140]  sued and gotten the secret documents this has been in major newspapers that
[01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:05.780]  the FBI anti-terror team was there the week before they lied about that and
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:10.420]  said they weren't and of course we've had Jane Graham and other witnesses who
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:14.540]  were inside who saw McVeigh in the building and other maintenance men
[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:19.380]  planting gray sticks of butter the grand jury was given this info but Hoppy
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:23.660]  Hodlberg was told to shut up the foreman of the grand jury and so so what
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:29.140]  you're saying dovetails with what McVeigh has told others specifically what
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:35.660]  else did McVeigh tell you sir well he also told me about the bombing that the
[01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:40.620]  major the major had told him that another team was placing seaford space
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:45.780]  explosives inside the Merle building and that there was actually two bombs went
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:51.420]  off the bomb that he built as well as the the seaford explosives inside the
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:56.220]  building and something you touched on about the military you know through
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:59.340]  these classified documents that Mr. Trendy and other people have been able
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:07.340]  to gather it is McVeigh's army records show that he has a military secret
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:13.420]  military clearance through 1996 that didn't expired in 1996 even though he
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:19.940]  allegedly was out of the service by 1992 including his his stent with the Army
[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:27.260]  National Guard in New York McVeigh told us that as part of his preparation and
[01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:33.460]  training for for the Merle building bombing that he actually did visit some
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:38.780]  military bases that was these meetings were arranged by the major and that he
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:44.620]  could at one point consider stealing explosives from military bases to build
[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:50.460]  his bomb rather than to use a fertilizer bomb now McVeigh had told other
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:54.300]  people things like this but then we're given these supposed media tapes
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:15:00.020]  audio tapes with him telling a different story but it's also even come out in
[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:04.340]  Newsweek that he said one day it will come out that the government did this
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:10.940]  specifically how were they controlling McVeigh did you ever see Jolly and
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:16.420]  Weston there with him why do we get different different versions or is that
[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:24.020]  the media cutting and pasting no I'm a lot of what you're getting is is what
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:30.340]  McVeigh wanted out to his his so-called story the the long wolf mastermind I
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:34.580]  mean that's that's the story that McVeigh wanted portrayed to the public at
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:39.820]  least so after his death and I mean recently I listened to the national
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:47.900]  broadcast of the tapes which was really nothing more than a verbal report on the
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:54.300]  book that Lou Michelle and and the other fellow wrote her back wrote about McVeigh
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:59.300]  mainly made me want to puke as I was listening to and watching this this
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:04.020]  program because it was nothing more than the official version of what
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:08.380]  allegedly happened in Oklahoma City and having heard from Tim's own mouth time
[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:13.420]  after time after time other things that contradicted that official story and
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:18.780]  haven't been able to verify these things it's really it really amazes me that
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:22.820]  the public continues or at least some of the public continues to buy his
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:26.980]  official version of the Oklahoma City bombing I mean it defies logic if you
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:31.820]  if you look at McVeigh and and all this travels and the things that he did the
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:35.380]  odd jobs that he held along the way there's no way could have even support
[01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:41.500]  himself let alone put together money for a bomb of the type and that that that
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:49.060]  they built actually for what it's worth I was at the ADX that's the Federal
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:53.140]  Supermax Prison in Florence Colorado where Terry Nichols was currently housed
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:57.660]  I was there with McVeigh before they activated the Federal Desk so again
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:04.380]  it and so the tapes the first two the first two days of taping that he did
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:08.860]  with with Lou Michelle I was in a cubicle right next to him that's a
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:14.340]  plexiglass I could see Tim it's you know he was walking around and gesturing
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:19.380]  wildly and which is which is how Tim was when he was telling a story or talking
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:23.500]  about something that that excited him so and you could over here bits and pieces
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:26.940]  of the conversation I was there with my attorney so we weren't really trying to
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:30.460]  listen to his conversation but sometimes you couldn't help but hear it and the
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:34.620]  fact that my attorney had never been around McVeigh or seen him he was you
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:41.700]  know he was a kind of paying attention but so and then they they finished up
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:48.420]  the second two days of that interview in January of 1999 after we had arrived
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:54.140]  here in Tarot and Tim would come back from from talking with the reporters
[01:17:54.140 --> 01:18:00.140]  and we would have questions and answer services through the door and next and
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:04.860]  we were we were in sales at the couple fells apart and here you communicate to
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:09.180]  the door out the back window that was at the old prison where we were we're
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:14.820]  actually in a new facility now but but we're Tim and I were it was easy for us
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:18.340]  to communicate so we didn't have to necessarily be outside of creation real
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:22.060]  fast David David Paul Hammer we're going to skip this break in case you get cut
[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:26.500]  off just to have it on record they have been keeping you from from from talking
[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:31.100]  to the media I'm not allowed to talk to the media and I fought it for 11 years
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:35.820]  in court the last the last news media interview that was allowed here was
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:39.660]  Timothy McVeigh's interview on 60 minutes after that they stopped all
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:45.300]  meeting interviews live face-to-face or otherwise there's very limited situation
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:52.140]  where you can get a monitored telephone interview incredible and and this this
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:58.220]  interview I mean why are you speaking out now here on this show in case they
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:04.020]  kick you off just it's very simple Alex I want the truth to come out I want I
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:08.220]  want people to investigate the facts are there I've laid out the fact in my
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:12.420]  latest book deadly secrets and I'm not just promoting the book we're trying to
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:16.820]  plug the book obviously I want to do that but it's more than that there's a
[01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:21.940]  roadmap to an investigation and if anyone that has the power to do it
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:26.340]  will just just initiate an investigation a grand jury investigation is what is
[01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:32.380]  needed I mean there's been other FBI people who said that you know there it
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:37.140]  seems to me I've said this before but Alex someone has to care what happened
[01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:42.100]  in Oklahoma City I mean I understand that 9-11 happened and it was a far more
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:47.220]  people lost their lives and it was more damaged as well but Oklahoma happened
[01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:51.420]  before that I hear you David David they could cut you off anytime other things
[01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:55.460]  that midway told you did he ever talk about you know how he was black ops
[01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:59.220]  which other people signed affidavits on like Terry Nichols did he ever talk
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:04.220]  about that and and why he was you know I mean did he ever try to get this
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:08.020]  information out were they threatening his family I mean was he angry about being
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:14.060]  set up as a patsy why why did the government bomb it he obviously any
[01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:18.620]  time you'd mention it or ask him or bring up the possibility that he was
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:23.340]  set up as a patsy he said absolutely not that things happened by design no he
[01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:29.140]  never said he was being threatened he made it appear in all his conversations
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:32.460]  with us that he truly believed he was working for the government that he was
[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:38.260]  still part of the military and he never you know Tim didn't care much for
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:42.980]  anyone other than himself he didn't have any love for his family his sister
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:48.300]  would be the exception his father his mother he you know let me throw this
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:52.580]  out then and people can pull this up a TV reporter and a newspaper reporter at
[01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:56.260]  his execution who witnessed it said when they took him out he was still
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:59.940]  breathing do you believe I mean he so you're saying he still thought he was
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:04.380]  working for the government he may have a face job and be living in Maui
[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:09.500]  well I don't know about Maui but I mean this is one of the scenarios and I talked
[01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:14.220]  about it again in the book is he told us many times he was actually on this
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:17.940]  issue from time to time but his main theme was that he was not going to be
[01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:24.260]  executed that the major was going to have someone infiltrate the execution
[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:28.020]  team and that they would be given drugs that would save the appearance of death
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:33.300]  but and he says the CIA and other people who use these drugs and that they
[01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:37.540]  would they would be taken out and he would be brought you know given some
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:41.580]  type of medication that would counteract the other and that he would be
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:46.700]  rewarded for for serving his country and you know it sounds a little bit far
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:52.100]  fetched but I mean I've talked to several people who witnessed the
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:57.900]  execution including Janie Coverdale and she doesn't she doesn't know one way
[01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:01.820]  or another whether Tim was executed he was covered up from from Tota to
[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:06.820]  Neck and he couldn't see any any type of IV lines or anything running into his
[01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:12.220]  veins and so she clearly says that she doesn't know if he was executed or not
[01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:18.820]  and she watched it so you know I don't know if Tim McVeigh is dead. So McVeigh
[01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:21.940]  told you well we can pull up the articles where reporters said he was
[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:25.500]  still breathing when they wheeled him out I mean I remember that on TV but it
[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:29.620]  wasn't national news it was in Indiana TV reporters a newspaper reporter I
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:33.100]  remember seeing one of the reporters on the news a black guy we've got to pull
[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:37.580]  that up that Google that you know reporters said it appeared McVeigh was
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:43.020]  still alive after execution sir this is Alex part of my part of my bargain with
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:47.860]  McVeigh to get him to provide me information so I could write the book
[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:52.220]  was that I'm a jailhouse lawyer and I do quite a bit of litigation for inmates
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:56.660]  and one of the things that he didn't want was an autopsy and he had the
[01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:59.940]  reason he didn't want autopsy is because he said he was going to be feigned the
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:04.140]  appearance of death and I thought that issue in my own case in my death penalty
[01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:07.900]  case with the assistance of my attorneys and we won the fact that you didn't have
[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:13.900]  to we won that and and and McVeigh used that as a precedent on himself so he
[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:17.660]  wouldn't have to have an autopsy I mean these are all things a lot of it
[01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:22.340]  circumstantial but it adds up to what to what he thought was going to happen but
[01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:26.580]  to be clear David Paul Hammer it's on record that you're in Terre Hoot Federal
[01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:32.420]  Execution Center right now and federal death row yeah fat the federal death row
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:37.220]  and and that that McVeigh told you that they were planning to stage his
[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:42.740]  execution that he was going to be rewarded why please repeat that on
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:47.460]  record and then secondarily did he ever talk about why the government bombed
[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:53.020]  Oklahoma City yes he did talk about that first I'll do what you ask about
[01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:57.780]  McVeigh did not believe that he was going to be executed he believed that he was
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:00.780]  going to go through the through the motions and that he was going to be
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:04.820]  given drugs that would pay the appearance of death and then didn't be
[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:08.460]  counteracted once he was out of the institution and in the custody of his
[01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:12.900]  attorney he was actually released to his remains was released to the custody of
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:18.460]  one of his attorneys okay secondarily quickly this is key why did the
[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:21.460]  government want to I mean why did he believe it was patriotic to to bomb
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:27.060]  okc well what what he came to believe that throughout the course of this
[01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:33.060]  mission was that this is a way for the government to gain control over the
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:39.940]  right-wing militia patriot movement that because of because of Ruby Ridge and
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:45.060]  because of Waco that the patriot movement was becoming stronger and stronger and
[01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:51.780]  that if there was a bombing that was attributed to people with with those
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:56.700]  leanings or those associations that the government could pass laws easier and
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:00.380]  that those type of people would fall out of favor with the American public
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:05.060]  okay sir data dump because we've got to take this network break in a few minutes
[01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:09.380]  and if you're still there and I appreciate you coming on this show and
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:14.820]  again this just dropped on our lap literally yesterday data dump in the
[01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:19.780]  next four minutes other key points that you want out there on the record well
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:25.620]  the fact that Tim McVeigh there's two things that that the one big thing is
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:30.660]  that the government had prior warning many many prior warnings that something
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:33.900]  was going to happen and statistically at the Murrow building was going to be
[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:40.820]  bombed and that McVeigh was involved also that Andreus Drosmeyer Dennis Mahon
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:48.100]  Roger Moore and the so-called the Aryan Republic Army members which was Peter
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:54.940]  Langdon Scott Stettiford Michael Bresna Kevin McCartney and Richard Guthrie
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:26:01.180]  were involved in the planning and security detail for me they as part of
[01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:05.620]  the bombing they were in they were on site in Oklahoma City other things I
[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:09.580]  want to be known is that the bomb that actually worked the building was
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:15.220]  according to Tim was not made or put together and in Kansas and driven to
[01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:20.740]  Oklahoma City it was actually put together in a warehouse he had told us
[01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:27.300]  the warehouse was just off of West Reno and there my our investigation and
[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:32.580]  things that we'd be able to verify we found out that the he had that Tim
[01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:36.460]  when arrested in his car he had a piece of paper with the address and telephone
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:43.060]  number for a storage facility there in Oklahoma City in about a half a mile
[01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:48.340]  from from West Reno so was he supposed to be picked up driving a big yellow car
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:55.380]  with no license plate well he told us that actually my Bresna and Richard
[01:26:55.380 --> 01:27:00.900]  Guthrie were supposed to pick him up in an SUV and that they didn't and so that
[01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:06.340]  they did that that the mercury was nothing but a secondary getaway car yeah
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:09.900]  he was set up that he was set up he probably wasn't they probably killed
[01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:13.220]  him I'm sure they told him they were gonna stage his death he was sheep dipped
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:17.740]  out of the army into black ops and and that's what Terry Nichols is sworn and
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:21.020]  then that's what all the evidence is I've talked to the grand jurors everybody
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:26.260]  they all know this and and what about Iraqis we know they had Iraqis that
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:28.580]  were brought in by the US government who'd been trained by the CIA in the
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:32.020]  80s when Saddam was our ally what about Iraqis swirling around did you ever
[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:36.980]  talk about that but you know he said that that the people who believe that
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:43.100]  that it was a red airing which I've tried to investigate find out what I
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:48.980]  could about about a foreign connection and I don't I don't have anything to say
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:53.020]  on that really because he Tim just kind of laughed it off when someone would
[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:56.620]  bring that up one thing I wanted I do want to mention and Terry Nichols
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:28:02.860]  sworn declaration he identifies Larry Potts as the person that make base that
[01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:07.980]  he was working for as a family and Larry Potts had said that he was in Dallas and
[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:11.860]  drove up flew up there that day but it turns out it's now been declassified
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:19.500]  that he was there before the bombing yes I've seen those documents and so I
[01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:23.900]  quit make they over and over over we could never get him to give us the
[01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:28.420]  identity of the major I should say here for your audience when I use the words
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:34.780]  we I'm talking about myself and a fellow death row inmate here who was in on a
[01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:39.740]  lot of the conversations that I had with the guy and so that's why I use the
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:46.060]  term we well this is all incredibly dangerous and I don't want to say one
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:51.940]  thing for your audience if you know what happened to him to Kenneth Michael
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:56.180]  Turner he was he was killed while in BOP custody in Oklahoma City at the Federal
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:29:03.380]  Transfer Center and the when when news got out in order to write my book I had

[01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:47.020]  David Paul Hammer was already in prison and was convicted of killing his
[01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:53.540]  cellmate it's on record that he was in for many years in both prisons that
[01:32:53.540 --> 01:32:58.180]  McVay stayed in for many many years and he's written this book and I've talked
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:02.060]  to lawyers involved he was told we'll stay your execution we won't execute
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:06.100]  you if you don't write this book can you tell that story and why you're
[01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:12.180]  basically forfeiting it looks like your life to get your book out sir well I'm
[01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:16.340]  doing it for because I want the truth to come out about two things the Oklahoma
[01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:22.660]  City bombing and and what started me on this this journey was the you know
[01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:27.260]  Kenneth Kenneth Turner who being killed at the Federal Transfer Center and my
[01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:32.700]  having contacted his brother and it just led from there but then September of
[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:36.980]  this year after I'd sent out bits and pieces of my manuscript for my latest
[01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:43.940]  book and the feds were had copies of it to prison officials two F2 people
[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:48.980]  claiming to be FBI agent showed up and I was taken out to a conference room where
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:54.580]  they showed me badges and credentials and told me that they they went a little
[01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:58.100]  preliminary conversation and told me look we we know about the book you're
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:03.300]  writing and the contents of the book and we have the authority to tell you that
[01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:10.260]  if you will not write this book and not publish this book at this time that we
[01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:17.260]  would we you will not face a resensing for the death penalty and that if you
[01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:22.020]  don't and can if you don't accept our offer and you continue to write this
[01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:25.980]  book we will use the full mind of the United States government against you to
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:31.100]  ensure that you were executed and have you seen the emails from the current
[01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:34.740]  Attorney General at the time the Deputy Attorney General which have even been on
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:39.180]  the you know drudge report where he's saying this is like D-Day we've got to
[01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:42.220]  get down there and cover this up you know this could destroy us I mean I
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:46.140]  guess we could guys pull up the Eric Holder emails on Oklahoma City I want to
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:50.020]  show those to people it's all over the web were you aware of that never seen
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:55.260]  those but I have seen the emails in the in the Trinity case from Eric Holder
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:35:00.340]  when he was deputy attorney general who where they did the what they called the
[01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:06.300]  the Trinity rollout plan to postpone the release of the OIG report yeah that's
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:10.780]  what I'm talking about that yeah but but yeah yeah yeah I've seen those I've
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:16.020]  seen all those email exchanges and and ultimately it's up to Eric Holder to
[01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:22.260]  decide whether or not I will be tried again I guess I should explain that in
[01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:28.060]  2005 federal district court overturned my death sentence in order that I be
[01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:33.740]  resented within 60 days that the government to seek to resend the
[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:37.980]  hearing that would be held before jury and then once again decide whether or
[01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:42.380]  not I received death or life without parole the government subsequently
[01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:48.380]  appealed that and ultimately the third circuit U.S. Court of Appeals told the
[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:50.820]  government that they didn't have jurisdiction until after always
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:56.100]  resendancy until after a resendancy and that we're at that point now the
[01:35:56.100 --> 01:36:01.500]  government has decided that they're going to allow us to present evidence to
[01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:06.900]  the Justice Department and then Eric Holder will be then make a decision the
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:11.580]  prior decision was made by Janet Reno in my case and a decision has to be made
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:16.620]  by Eric Holder so obviously my attorneys were very upset that I decided to go
[01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:21.820]  forward with this because in my book I'm not very friendly to Eric Holder
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:26.500]  because I print the facts about Eric Holder's involvement in the
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:31.100]  trinity case how can people read the book it's available it's the name of the
[01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:37.380]  book is deadly secrets and it's available at authorhouse.com we also
[01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:43.500]  have a website deadly-secrets.com you can get information for
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:48.140]  ordering the book there but you've been unable with audio to put this out on
[01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:51.980]  your own voice so correct me if I'm wrong this is the first time that you've
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:57.220]  been able to speak about this on air this is the first time live I did one
[01:36:57.220 --> 01:37:02.260]  recorded conversation or interview a couple of weeks ago but this is the
[01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:07.580]  first time that I've been able to do it live and with a national audience is that
[01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:15.460]  recorded tape been released yes it's on the internet it was with Scott Shannon
[01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:24.980]  and if you go to my website www.deadly-secrets.com there's a link there
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:31.780]  to an hour and 27 minute interviews that I did good good I'm glad that others
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:36.580]  have gotten it out good job to those folks wow this is so amazing it turns
[01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:40.340]  out people been trying to get a hold of me involvement with this case the last
[01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:43.300]  month and it's been and I haven't been able to get through to me I've just got
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:46.660]  to figure out some way with all the data we're getting to go through it all in
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:51.220]  the time we've got left again other points you want to make about McVay you
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:54.580]  know how you learned about the Oklahoma City case through the trinity case and
[01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:58.660]  that's the case that's got all these federal documents out they thought you
[01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:01.060]  know he was somebody involved they were trying to get rid of the witness they
[01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:05.340]  tortured into death that's on record just just just so incredible please
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:10.900]  continue well I guess I should say a couple of things I'm from Oklahoma I
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:16.300]  was born and raised there and I never thought I would be on death row with the
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:23.060]  Tennessee McVay but you know sometimes you know things happen and strange
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:30.980]  twists and fate I would say that I guess I want to get back I mentioned earlier
[01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:35.660]  about the government's prior warning I mean it's out there in the public
[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:42.500]  domain about Carol Howell having told her handlers with the ATF about
[01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:47.500]  Strassmeyer and Dennis Mahon chasing the building and I want to back you up
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:52.740]  she she was an ATF infiltrator left hand not knowing what the right hand she
[01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:56.260]  worked for them on record and they what indicted her because she wouldn't shut
[01:38:56.260 --> 01:39:00.740]  up and and then she defeated that right she was acquitted she was she was
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:04.060]  ultimately acquitted but during her trial the fact that you know the facts
[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:09.140]  came out that yes she had told her handler all all about you know the
[01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:13.060]  planning for for a bombing and from you know pretty much launched from
[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:23.580]  Elohim City so again if you if you look at Strassmeyer if you look at Andrea Strassmeyer I mean he
[01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:28.700]  was here illegally and I've had a worn out for his arrest the ATF had a had a
[01:39:28.700 --> 01:39:34.220]  be on the lookout out for him and they actually planned a raid on Elohim City
[01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:40.620]  for February of 1995 two months before the bombing and for some unknown reason
[01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:46.100]  Bob Ricks who was in charge of the FBI in Oklahoma City directed the ATF and the
[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:52.100]  FBI in Tulsa not to not to have that raid so there were good government
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:56.340]  people trying to stop this and it also came out in federal documents if two
[01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:59.460]  separate groups they blacked it out and one blacked out another but you can put
[01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:02.540]  the two over and and basically get the full memo and that's also been in
[01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:08.780]  mainstream news mainly the papers out of Utah where mr. Trinitas been working on
[01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:12.980]  the case his brother killed and in there it talks about Southern Parvy Law Center
[01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:16.020]  with infiltrators in there as well do you have any Southern Parvy Law Center
[01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:23.780]  info well Kim didn't know or seem not to know that that people from the Southern
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:29.380]  Parvy Law Center were actually in Elham City you know these he did mention a
[01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:33.780]  lot of influence at El at Elham City it was it was not it was made it was known
[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:39.860]  as a as ABC alphabet city you know amongst the some of the Patriot crowd
[01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:47.740]  and and McVeigh referred to Elham City that way several times you know there
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:53.180]  are there are other documents about the government having prior warning or
[01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:57.260]  McVeigh mentioning the fact that he was working for the government his initial
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:02.340]  attorney in this in this case was in Oklahoma City who later withdrew
[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:07.580]  because of conflict of interest in the defense documents which were are now in
[01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:13.100]  the University of Texas in Austin in their archives and that's why I've been
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:18.740]  able to get tons of the McVeigh defense documents his first attorney he told he
[01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:23.900]  told his first attorney that he was actually working for the government and
[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:28.620]  you know there's a report that there's a report all about McVeigh and and when
[01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:32.660]  he when he found out that the attorney had devolved this information to an
[01:41:32.660 --> 01:41:39.860]  investigator and and to his current legal team he went ballistic so I think
[01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:44.260]  that's a big point that people that that people need to realize is that Oklahoma
[01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:48.100]  City was two things the government had prior knowledge that something was going
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:52.740]  to happen and McVeigh did not act alone and he didn't act just with the
[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:57.860]  assistance of the 40 years and and Terry Nichols well that's on record that
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:02.300]  there wasn't a facts sent out to federal offices and federal FBI buildings
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:05.620]  and that they thought they were going to bomb the FBI building that day not the
[01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:10.380]  Alfred P Murrow building that day of course had offices in both and then so
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:15.140]  it's on record that that there were good feds out there trying to warn people
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:21.900]  ahead of it well yeah I mean a perfect example of that is the fact that the US
[01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:26.980]  District Judge Wayne Alley stated that he was told not to come to work that day
[01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:32.820]  I mean that as he said that's been in the mainstream media and and just if you
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:38.140]  look at who was there who wasn't there when the bombing happened that also adds
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:44.020]  credence to the fact that were of the fact that they said about the government
[01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:48.980]  being involved well David Paul Hammer on death row in Tarahoon, Indiana I want to
[01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:54.220]  be clear I've studied this since 1995 when it happened everything you've said
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:58.660]  is been backed up by other statements other affidavits government documents
[01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:01.700]  well I want to just say for listeners tuning in saying why should we believe
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:06.500]  a convicted murderer who killed a cellmate and that's why he's on death
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:12.660]  row because everything he's saying is backed up with other people's statements
[01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:16.820]  and it's just it's scary to have to even be involved in this and cover this but
[01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:23.180]  we don't have a country we don't have a future if we bow down to this and I think
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:25.740]  it's very important that you not be executed I think it's very important
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:30.340]  that they unfreeze the fact that they'll never let you get to the media I mean how
[01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:35.900]  many years has it been since you've been able to ever talk to media live the
[01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:42.860]  last time I was able to talk to me you was in December 1999 they that was before
[01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:47.460]  McVeigh's 60 minute interview and they stopped all others and that was a that
[01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:53.140]  was a TV interview the TV local TV interviews that I gave them and all all
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:56.740]  requests from national interviews even before that and afterwards have been
[01:43:56.740 --> 01:44:01.860]  denied you know my flight I thought it all the way Supreme Court and had
[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:07.300]  numerous news organizations I had 22 news organizations filed a meekest brief
[01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:10.060]  with the United States Supreme Court asking the court to hear this case
[01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:13.460]  because they thought the ban on the media and I'm talking about all the
[01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:17.780]  mainstream media from from the early times to the Washington Post New York
[01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:25.180]  Times they all they all joined the amicus brief the reporters for reporters
[01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:31.860]  I can't professional journalism know I can't remember all the names of the
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:36.500]  societies that joined in but it was it was impressive but well here we are in
[01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:40.260]  the world's hearing it right now other things McVeigh told you run back through
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:48.260]  it any other points you haven't made well a couple things and I found I found
[01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:54.660]  support in this is the fact that he he rented a truck in St. Paul Minnesota and
[01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:59.900]  one of the trucks that was used to build a bomb not the bomb that actually
[01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:05.460]  exploded but another bomb that one that Terry Nichols helped in construct the
[01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:11.020]  truck was actually rented a rider truck rented in St. Paul Minnesota I found in
[01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:15.180]  the documents when he told me this I just I was somewhat skeptical I was
[01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:19.540]  never able to track it down but bound to behold when I when I got a hold of the
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:26.180]  sense documents there was an FBI 302 and it says that there was a grand jury
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:30.980]  going on at the same time the grand jury was was convened in Oklahoma City a
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:37.300]  second grand jury was conceived was convened in St. Paul Minnesota and that
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:41.780]  they were investigating the and trying to get records from a rider truck rental
[01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:48.260]  agency there and so I truly believe there was there was at least three trucks
[01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:53.900]  used as part of the bombing plot in Oklahoma City and that I've been able to
[01:45:53.900 --> 01:46:01.420]  verify again if you just joined us David Paul Hammer has been able to get
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:06.820]  through to us and there's no gag order nothing even legal involved from the
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:10.060]  lawyers I've talked to this is just the government won't let anybody talk to
[01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:12.980]  death row inmates and I think that violates their first amendment I think
[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:17.620]  it empowers tyranny if I ever get framed for something or put in prison I
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:20.860]  want to be able to talk to the media they built a new supermax the news is
[01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:24.460]  reported that they're going to keep quote American terrorists in when their
[01:46:24.460 --> 01:46:27.980]  suspects and they're not allowed to talk to their family friends or even lawyers
[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:31.380]  they've got legislation where citizens can be secretly arrested stripped of all
[01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:35.100]  rights the violent belligerence act but it says in there for any intelligence
[01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:39.900]  purpose you disappear and then and then only an act of Congress can even tell
[01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:43.300]  folks where you are you can be given enhanced interrogation that's been in
[01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:47.820]  the news you know the headline Senate wants citizens to be arrested if they're
[01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:52.700]  on suspicion of terrorism and be stripped of citizenship are sir you're not
[01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:58.540]  planning to commit suicide in jail are you no I'm not I have absolutely no
[01:46:58.540 --> 01:47:03.420]  no intent or desire to to kill myself as a matter of fact I want to live as long
[01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:12.020]  as I can you know and I want I want to say this that I'm speaking out publicly
[01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:17.100]  because I want them to be a record of what I have to say and and one of the
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:20.820]  questions that I would pose to your audience and to you and and just to
[01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:25.660]  anyone what in the world does the government think I can say that's going
[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:29.180]  to harm them the only thing can be is that they're going to be I mean what's
[01:47:29.180 --> 01:47:33.140]  going to happen if they if it comes out that yes in fact they covered up they
[01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:36.900]  covered up what happened in Oklahoma City and there's no doubt they did but I'm
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:40.700]  an inmate on death row and as you said credibility is an issue people will
[01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:44.660]  believe me or they won't you know I don't have an act to grind with the
[01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:48.780]  government well I believe you because he told he told other I mean I mean we have
[01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:51.260]  to pull up the mainstream articles I can't remember all the places but the
[01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:54.540]  quote was one day it's going to come out the government did this do you remember
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:48:02.660]  where he said that no but but I have I have read or heard that before and and
[01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:07.220]  that then McVay clearly knew that I was going to write the information he was
[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:11.540]  giving me you know I wrote an earlier book that was published in 2004 but
[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:15.340]  without the benefit of the investigation and the documents and the
[01:48:15.340 --> 01:48:20.220]  stuff that we've been able to accumulate since then and so I mean I wrote the
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:23.700]  book and told bits and pieces of what make they told us but the majority of
[01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:27.820]  the stuff I had to leave out because they hadn't been verified yet and this
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:33.020]  latest book details and yeah give the websites out again for people that want
[01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:42.380]  to go see this testament it's a deadly WWW deadly hyphen secrets dot com where
[01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:45.900]  you just Google deadly secrets or David Paul Hammer it'll come up that way too
[01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:49.780]  well I hope you've got I hope you've got a lot of bandwidth because you're gonna
[01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:55.700]  get hit with a probably 500,000 hits well I really hope that people go and
[01:48:55.700 --> 01:49:01.540]  look at it and and not only that it's a you know Alex someone has to care
[01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:05.980]  someone has to still care what happened in Oklahoma City oh listen Mr. Hammer
[01:49:05.980 --> 01:49:09.140]  I'm risking my life right now even doing this interview with you I've got a
[01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:13.820]  family I understand somebody's got to stand up somebody's got to say no I'm
[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:17.820]  not a death row inmate I've seen all the documents you've seen it's on record
[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:21.460]  that they blew that building and then none of us are safe and we've got I mean
[01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:24.540]  look how they're looting us with the banks look at how they want to arrest
[01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:28.980]  citizens now with no charges I mean we're in trouble and so we need men to be
[01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:33.180]  men not mice and stand up to these people and I'll never commit suicide and
[01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:38.460]  I don't use drugs and I'm not involved in anything illegal right well I just I
[01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:42.940]  also want to tell you I welcome that I welcome this opportunity to be able to
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:46.700]  speak out and I thank you for giving me the opportunity because you know I have
[01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:52.020]  been wanting a way to not just make a written testament of what happened but
[01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:56.740]  to get people to mobilize I don't know if me saying anything is gonna mobilize
[01:49:56.740 --> 01:50:01.060]  anyone but I hope it'll at least motivate people to think about well
[01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:05.380]  resistance is victory resistance is victory and you have in the car and I
[01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:08.100]  believe you because everything you've already said is confirmed by others
[01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:11.860]  separately I mean I mean when you talk about him saying they were gonna stage
[01:50:11.860 --> 01:50:15.940]  his death it was in the newspaper on TV in Indiana that he was breathing when
[01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:19.740]  they took him out I mean he pulled that up I mean it's ridiculous I don't know
[01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:24.100]  final segment with our guest hopefully he'll still be there when we get back
[01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:30.460]  from break but by the grace of God his call made it through to us and this is

[01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:40.380]  know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:43.780]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:47.580]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:50.740]  seeds about perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:54.660]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:59.380]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival

[01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:43.100]  David Paul Hammer on Death Row he's been interviewed by the LA Times you name it
[01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:46.900]  it's on records he talked to McVay a lot and we're talking during the break
[01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:51.300]  about the ways they can persecute him I was talking about all these clampdowns
[01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:54.460]  on prisons where people don't have any rights which is really dangerous and he
[01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:57.900]  said oh yeah there's people in this prison that no one ever sees and he
[01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:01.580]  talked about what they may do they may come in his cell when they find out they
[01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:05.700]  have to physically unplug the phone this is a special phone system that he's on
[01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:10.620]  right now sir go over that and then let's talk about the fatigued leg that
[01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:15.060]  came out in the news a leg they can never identify with a body in 1995 go
[01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:20.220]  ahead well I'll first talk about the people here who are on special
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:24.660]  administrative measures which was enacted by an act of Congress where you know
[01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:30.540]  people sentenced or awaiting trial could be held in special confinement where
[01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:35.660]  they're isolated without any access to the phone correspondence or or anyone
[01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:40.040]  else they're just totally isolated and we have three of those people here on
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:44.420]  death row in a different part of the building where we never see them and
[01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:48.700]  they never see us so it's a dungeon you just disappear and that's what this new
[01:54:48.700 --> 01:54:54.380]  national law will do to everybody go ahead well you know that's that they've
[01:54:54.380 --> 01:55:00.020]  had those feet some of those people here for for three years and the thing I
[01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:05.220]  wanted to talk about they told us that there was a man that he called
[01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:09.860]  poindexter who actually helped him put together the bomb actually made the bomb
[01:55:09.860 --> 01:55:15.180]  in the warehouse in Oklahoma City and that after the bomb was completed when
[01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:20.020]  the major and one of his associates came to the warehouse where McVeigh and
[01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:25.900]  poindexter still were to look over the bomb before they the next morning this
[01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:33.700]  happened to eat the late evening of April 18th 1995 that poindexter had his
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:38.900]  throat slit and was killed and thrown into the back of the truck and then the
[01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:44.820]  locks placed on the rider truck and that when he was somewhat taken aback by
[01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:48.260]  what had just happened in the major told him that hey that he wasn't one of us
[01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:54.140]  meaning military and therefore he couldn't be trusted and he was put in
[01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:59.860]  the bomb once the bomb exploded and all the havoc and all the deaths and may
[01:55:59.860 --> 01:56:05.740]  him when when the when the medical examiner's office was finished
[01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:11.740]  identifying people and there was an extra leg and the extra leg was
[01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:17.820]  found it was a tired and military fatigue and a combat boot and that leg
[01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:22.860]  has never been identified to this day I believe that that's a that's a big
[01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:28.380]  lead make they kind of laughed on a couple of times and said look all they
[01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:33.540]  have to do is run a DNA test it's gonna be in the military database or the CIA
[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:41.380]  database now of their agents or of military personnel I don't know that
[01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:46.740]  that is the fact is the case but now it is all everybody 37 and younger is in a
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:50.300]  CIA Pentagon database that's now mainstream news blood's taken at birth
[01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:55.620]  everybody 37 now 38 or younger is in the database born in a hospital told people
[01:56:55.620 --> 01:57:01.500]  this 14 years ago now declassified and of course the the FBI CIA Pentagon all
[01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:05.180]  have access to the troops blood as well they also use it to frame people but go
[01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:13.140]  ahead well so and there was testimony at that Terry Nichols trial and that
[01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:20.860]  McVeigh's trial about this extra leg and you know the medical examiner Dr.
[01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:25.620]  Fred B. Jordan he was a medical examiner at the time in Oklahoma City he said
[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:28.620]  that yes we have this extra leg and no one has come to claim it there was
[01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:34.860]  further testimony from experts who involved in bombings in England who
[01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:39.140]  testified that in all the all the bombing cases there there was they were
[01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:43.060]  always someone came if there was an extra body part someone always came to
[01:57:43.060 --> 01:57:51.780]  to to to identify the victims of the explosives and so this is a this is
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:57.380]  the clue the leg and other body parts were actually buried in a grave close
[01:57:57.380 --> 01:58:02.940]  to the state capitol building in Oklahoma City but Dr. Dr. Jordan testified
[01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:08.780]  that he could not identify this individual whoever the owner the leg was
[01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:13.060]  stay there got a break one minute one minute final five minutes from death

[01:59:46.540 --> 01:59:54.060]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:59:54.060 --> 01:59:59.660]  Alex Jones we have liberty and freedom because our ancestors will stand up
[01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:03.180]  against corruption that's why we have private property second amendment if we
[02:00:03.180 --> 02:00:06.660]  don't have courage and stand up against evil men and murderous dangerous groups
[02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:12.620]  then the sky's the limit we cannot capitulate and it's dangerous for me to
[02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:18.660]  be talking about this it's dangerous for everybody involved you know and it's
[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:23.060]  just horrible Bob Chapman's coming up on the economy we have no future unless we
[02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:26.620]  just stand up and tell the truth and that's why I feel good about what I've
[02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:31.100]  done and everything that David Paul Hammer on death row with McVeigh for
[02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:34.260]  many many years on record he was with him did talk to him that's you know even
[02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:37.660]  in the LA Times other publications and everything he said about the case is on
[02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:42.700]  record from other people in the last four minutes we've got left sir you've
[02:00:42.700 --> 02:00:47.380]  got the floor final comments because you haven't been live on the media in 11
[02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:51.100]  years and they're planning to execute you very soon and they told you they
[02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:54.100]  wouldn't execute you if you wouldn't write the book so in the last four
[02:00:54.100 --> 02:00:59.980]  minutes closing comments for the audience well I would I would ask your
[02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:06.940]  audience you know not to not to just credit what I'm saying just because of
[02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:11.420]  why I am and in my situation this is far more important this is not about me
[02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:15.140]  it's not even about Timothy McVeigh anymore it's about the government and
[02:01:15.140 --> 02:01:20.220]  it's about those who are still out there a terrorist who helped to plan and and
[02:01:20.220 --> 02:01:24.020]  carry out the Oklahoma City bombing they have not been brought to justice
[02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:28.900]  they're there and not only have they not been brought to justice for for the
[02:01:28.900 --> 02:01:32.340]  Oklahoma City bombing but they haven't been brought to justice for killing
[02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:38.700]  Kenneth Trinadu in mistakenly thinking that he was part of the bombing
[02:01:38.700 --> 02:01:44.900]  plot you know the government well bargers have oftentimes claim when
[02:01:44.900 --> 02:01:50.820]  they're presenting an inmate witness or an informant or someone to the jury in
[02:01:50.820 --> 02:01:55.220]  their cases we don't pick our jury we don't pick our witnesses well you know
[02:01:55.220 --> 02:02:00.580]  I just just happened I mean I'm on death row I'm speaking I'm saying what
[02:02:00.580 --> 02:02:04.420]  McVeigh told me I want to make something perfectly clear I'm not vouching for the
[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:09.180]  veracity of what they told me what I am vouching for is the veracity of what
[02:02:09.180 --> 02:02:13.940]  we've been able to substantiate through thousands of pages of documents I want
[02:02:13.940 --> 02:02:18.380]  to bring up a couple other quick points Jesse Trinadu has filed numerous
[02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:23.820]  freedom of information suit and recently two things is really kind of
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:27.660]  striking stricken me and that's the fact that the government don't want to
[02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:32.660]  doesn't want to turn over video that's taken outside the Merrill building on
[02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:37.380]  April 19th and they don't want to turn over an unredacted copy of the hang the
[02:02:37.380 --> 02:02:43.340]  Charlie Hagger hanger video taken from the dashboard of his cruiser and
[02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:49.060]  in response to the request for records from the CIA their response was and is
[02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:52.980]  that it would be a day it would be a danger to national security to turn
[02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:57.260]  over these documents how in the world could it be a danger to national
[02:02:57.260 --> 02:03:01.660]  security unless some other country or someone from some other country i.e.
[02:03:01.660 --> 02:03:05.980]  Andrea Strassmann was involved in the Oklahoma City bombing so these are
[02:03:05.980 --> 02:03:10.140]  questions that I hope your audience will think about and not only think about
[02:03:10.140 --> 02:03:14.460]  but be moved to some type of action whether it's the right your elected
[02:03:14.460 --> 02:03:18.540]  official whether it's the protest whether it's to be on the internet whether
[02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:23.780]  it's a talk on the Alex Jones show people need to mobilize and find out
[02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:29.140]  what happened in Oklahoma City on April 19th 1995 the victims and the victims
[02:03:29.140 --> 02:03:34.340]  families deserve that Paul you got believe it Paul we've only got one minute
[02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:38.780]  left I mean if you don't win these appeals or they don't reverse it when
[02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:43.100]  are you going to be executed I'm still I'm still a long way from being executed
[02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:46.940]  because it's up to Eric Holder right now to make a decision of whether they're
[02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:50.820]  going to re-sense me to death all right or at least attempt to re-sense me to
[02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:55.620]  death and and he has a as as of now he has a he's under a court order to make
[02:03:55.620 --> 02:04:00.140]  that decision by April so it would be some time after that David Paul Hammer

[02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:04.740]  who was in terrorhood Indiana on death row he was at the other supermax before
[02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:08.740]  they even built it with McVeigh he's been interviewed by the LA Times and
[02:08:08.740 --> 02:08:14.940]  others it's a fact that he knew McVeigh and Terry Nichols separately has filed
[02:08:14.940 --> 02:08:18.900]  affidavits saying the same thing declarations with Jesse trying to do the
[02:08:18.900 --> 02:08:22.660]  lawyer whose brother was tortured to death and killed in the cover up they
[02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:27.060]  thought he was one of their operatives just been confirmed he wasn't this is
[02:08:27.060 --> 02:08:29.900]  just so horrible but you were saying something you know I said well I'll try
[02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:32.180]  to get back in touch with you in the next few weeks and you said well if I'm
[02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:36.900]  not dead again specifically you're not planning to commit suicide restate what
[02:08:36.900 --> 02:08:43.180]  you said sir no Alex I'm not planning to commit suicide and if anything happens
[02:08:43.180 --> 02:08:47.100]  to me you know at what I thought what I told you was but yeah I'd like to talk
[02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:54.260]  to you again in a few weeks assuming that they don't kill me I won't say
[02:08:54.260 --> 02:09:00.140]  that I'm paranoid about what they might do but I am somewhat fearful I know that
[02:09:00.140 --> 02:09:05.500]  it's the government and they can pretty much do anything so I know what they
[02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:10.620]  what they did with with Kenner trainer do and I've seen what they do to have
[02:09:10.620 --> 02:09:19.620]  done to other inmates so there's a certain bit of fear about talking out
[02:09:19.620 --> 02:09:25.220]  but I believe it's worth it and you know if something was to happen to me then
[02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:29.340]  I will have given my life for it for a good cause the truth I think there's no
[02:09:29.340 --> 02:09:34.140]  better cause than the truth and the truth about home city just hasn't come
[02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:41.260]  out yet at least not officially all right again on death row for you said
[02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:46.700]  you were arguing and fighting with your cellmate and strangled him it all I know
[02:09:46.700 --> 02:09:50.260]  is your case fits with everything else we've seen all the documentation and
[02:09:50.260 --> 02:09:54.780]  what others said they were with McVeigh and just a bombshell interview and we're
[02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:59.180]  gonna pray for you so this information gets out David Paul Hammer one more time
[02:09:59.180 --> 02:10:09.180]  your website it's www.deadly-secrets.com and Alex I thank you and I thank
[02:10:09.180 --> 02:10:14.700]  your listeners for for tuning in and and hearing what I have to say well if we
[02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:19.860]  don't stand together we're gonna hang separate and you know it's it's it's
[02:10:19.860 --> 02:10:23.820]  just amazing and I wish it wasn't true I wish there wasn't all these government
[02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:30.060]  documents that have come out thanks to Trinidad's lawsuit and I mean it came
[02:10:30.060 --> 02:10:34.140]  out that the FBI terrorism head was there in line about it turned out it was
[02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:38.340]  just all in operation it's scary to have to get on air and confront these people
[02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:41.380]  but they're gonna keep doing it if we don't expose them what what about our
[02:10:41.380 --> 02:10:44.940]  children what about our future what about our society if we just capitulate
[02:10:44.940 --> 02:10:52.620]  to this Nazi you know style garbage you know Alex we don't want as a people we
[02:10:52.620 --> 02:10:55.940]  don't want to believe that our government could do something like this but
[02:10:55.940 --> 02:10:59.700]  time and time again history has shown that that our government has done things
[02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:04.540]  that are very that are very disgraceful to us so I mean I don't think it's such
[02:11:04.540 --> 02:11:09.180]  a stretch to believe that the government had some hand in Oklahoma City to what
[02:11:09.180 --> 02:11:13.060]  extent I'm not certain well a great article on this subject is the Trinidad
[02:11:13.060 --> 02:11:16.940]  case a cover-up that won't stay covered by dr. Paul Craig Roberts and people
[02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:20.340]  want to learn more about this case becoming a window and everything that's
[02:11:20.340 --> 02:11:25.580]  happened David Paul Hammer anything else no I just want to say thank you again
[02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:31.540]  and and and people do something let's let your voice be heard on the Oklahoma
[02:11:31.540 --> 02:11:35.820]  City well it's been used to demonize the Patriot movement they've ordered the
[02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:39.500]  Atari militia release but the feds have filed to keep them in prison turns out
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:45.140]  that's a complete setup and it's it's it's just amazing all right well
[02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:49.060]  hopefully we'll get a chance to talk to you again his first interview in 11
[02:11:49.060 --> 02:11:54.460]  years no law no nothing no gag order they just prison we just won't let him
[02:11:54.460 --> 02:11:57.100]  talk to anybody and now they're cracking down and now they want to be able to
[02:11:57.100 --> 02:12:01.140]  arrest any citizen secretly hand them over to the Pentagon and you disappear
[02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:04.820]  into a black hole you know that's the news headline strip terror suspects of US
[02:12:04.820 --> 02:12:09.660]  citizenship this is for all of us none of us are safe David Paul Hammer thank

[02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:20.540]  when we got contacted and confirmed through the sources and through the
[02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:30.660]  legal people that that you know that I mean that this is I just you know when I
[02:12:30.660 --> 02:12:35.460]  see this stuff I don't even want to cover it because it's so sick it's so
[02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:39.780]  painful it's so bad and I know why we're a nation in denial because people just
[02:12:39.780 --> 02:12:42.780]  don't want to believe this but it's it's millions of times worse than even
[02:12:42.780 --> 02:12:48.420]  Oklahoma City I mean it's a Pulitzer prize winning book by one of the chief
[02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:57.540]  lawyers in Nuremberg on IG Farben and the US government and how they took the
[02:12:57.540 --> 02:13:01.660]  Nazi plans to put fluoride in the water to partially sterilize us reduce
[02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:06.740]  fertility and brain damages I mean I did you what is that IG Farben crime and
[02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:15.180]  punishment I mean you can't make this stuff up you can't make it up it's just
[02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:20.260]  why I mean these black op operators that bombed the building your kids are
[02:13:20.260 --> 02:13:26.700]  drinking fluoride water why well they get in these macho cultures and they're
[02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:29.620]  told you know these militias are dangerous to follow your orders and they
[02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:32.900]  taught and they find the psychological types of trips I mean it was
[02:13:32.900 --> 02:13:36.220]  declassified in 2004 well it was leaked on WikiLeaks and the government
[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:40.380]  confirmed it was real the current army manual at least by 2004 actually came out
[02:13:40.380 --> 02:13:47.580]  2006 was 2004 manual for captains and above who were in special ops how to
[02:13:47.580 --> 02:13:57.060]  stage terror attacks I mean it's it's standard and you know what it's just we
[02:13:57.060 --> 02:14:00.980]  got all these secret agents running around there a bunch of killers and of
[02:14:00.980 --> 02:14:04.780]  course they carried out 9-11 as well and they're getting ready to launch World
[02:14:04.780 --> 02:14:09.980]  War three with Iran and and and why why why why have we allowed pure evil to
[02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:13.700]  take over our government I apologize to Bob Chapman having to hold for 14
[02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:17.700]  minutes but I know he understands with with this death row a call the first in
[02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:23.900]  11 years that's made it out and by the grace of God is the luck of the Irish
[02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:30.260]  whatever we always are able to get the job done but it doesn't even shake me
[02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:33.860]  up it just it overwhelms me Bob Chapman what did you think about the info you
[02:14:33.860 --> 02:14:41.780]  just heard the curly heartbreaking and that's what I've been fighting for over
[02:14:41.780 --> 02:14:46.980]  50 years and it just gets worse and worse and worse I get more brazen and
[02:14:46.980 --> 02:14:52.620]  more arrogant and we are going to beat them but you people have got to help us
[02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:57.500]  you've got to help this gentleman who has been incarcerated for 11 years we
[02:14:57.500 --> 02:15:03.420]  got to get that story out to everybody and let the people know how deranged
[02:15:03.420 --> 02:15:17.100]  their government is in many many aspects deranged is the word they enjoy it
[02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:21.740]  too it's it's like like I enjoy going fishing and watching a thunderstorm blow
[02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:27.740]  in I just enjoy a cheeseburger I don't I don't want to screw anybody over I
[02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:32.780]  don't want to steal anything I don't and I just just the general public too so
[02:15:32.780 --> 02:15:40.500]  many of them the arrogance the envy the evil I'm sorry Bob yeah you were in
[02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:43.940]  military intelligence before you became with the biggest golden silver private
[02:15:43.940 --> 02:15:46.260]  broker out there and then had the biggest newsletter out there and help
[02:15:46.260 --> 02:15:52.780]  public Gary Allen's book none there call it conspiracy 50 years fighting I want
[02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:56.900]  to get into the economy but again it's surreal they're openly saying the euro
[02:15:56.900 --> 02:16:00.260]  may collapse our cozy's threatening to pull out trilateral Commission once
[02:16:00.260 --> 02:16:06.380]  war with Iran US faces same problems as Greece as Bank of England we may
[02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:10.740]  collapse London Telegraph European power brokers openly announced world
[02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:14.300]  government present proposal for new economic and political order run by the
[02:16:14.300 --> 02:16:22.340]  crooks and it's like it's like it's not even real it's just all happening Bob
[02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:29.300]  and nothing's a rearguard action it's all attack and they're not going to take
[02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:37.900]  any prisoners and we're getting to them big believe me I know we are as I hate
[02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:42.020]  I you know you see it in the emails that you're getting in from people that
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:46.460]  coming in from all over the world I mean why would they have you and I over in
[02:16:46.460 --> 02:16:51.220]  Europe on radio and television and you're hunted you have to travel all
[02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:55.300]  over the world you're hunted and I'm here and then we've got their people
[02:16:55.300 --> 02:16:59.060]  crawling all over us and it's only the prayers and the grace of God we're still
[02:16:59.060 --> 02:17:02.940]  here plus if they people know I'm clean and if they do something to me or set me
[02:17:02.940 --> 02:17:07.900]  up they know it's going to underline everything I've said and done Bob and
[02:17:07.900 --> 02:17:12.660]  they will try to do that and they will try over and over and over again like
[02:17:12.660 --> 02:17:19.220]  they've done to me since 1967 how much you'd like to be audited 15 years in a
[02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:27.060]  row and have no change which is illegal of course and hundreds of thousands of
[02:17:27.060 --> 02:17:32.500]  dollars I had to do and spend for attorneys and accountants to prove that
[02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:39.980]  I hadn't you know I had paid the proper tax and this was harassment and in my
[02:17:39.980 --> 02:17:46.940]  business the SEC the NESD the state regulators in my office every single day
[02:17:46.940 --> 02:17:53.780]  for years trying to get rid of me but now everything you wrote about 20 30 40
[02:17:53.780 --> 02:17:58.340]  years ago is mainstream news but they put a sickening spin on it to say the
[02:17:58.340 --> 02:18:03.260]  bankers that have robbed you and set you up they're gonna tax everything and and
[02:18:03.260 --> 02:18:08.820]  the good times are over they're just so they're trying to break our will well
[02:18:08.820 --> 02:18:14.020]  that isn't gonna happen they know that and they know eventually they're gonna
[02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:18.980]  have to shut us up one way or the other and that's why seven years ago or more
[02:18:18.980 --> 02:18:24.660]  I stepped out of harm's way if they want me they're gonna have to come find me
[02:18:25.220 --> 02:18:29.660]  oh Bob I want to get into the economy when we come back what happened with a
[02:18:29.660 --> 02:18:35.700]  thousand point plunge what's going on right now in Europe I mean I turn on the
[02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:40.180]  news and it's all about basketball meanwhile the the globalists themselves
[02:18:40.180 --> 02:18:47.780]  say worldwide total implosion and it doesn't have to be this way I mean we
[02:18:47.780 --> 02:18:51.920]  it doesn't have to happen and it's so bad it's disillusioned dr. Paul Greg
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:56.180]  Roberts he's he's he's hit the escape pod button with a few final interviews
[02:18:56.180 --> 02:19:00.780]  here I but we're so close I mean the people are finally starting to listen
[02:19:00.780 --> 02:19:05.540]  but it's it's just it's so obvious to anybody that actually researches it it's
[02:19:05.540 --> 02:19:08.180]  just ridiculous that we have to put up with this Bob stay there I'm gonna come
[02:19:08.180 --> 02:19:12.100]  back and shut up and have you just take the floor and talk about all these

[02:24:01.140 --> 02:24:05.700]  their bosses the federal government stage something they can roll out I might
[02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:08.620]  be in the special this weekend coming up by Anderson Cooper it's called white
[02:24:08.620 --> 02:24:12.420]  al-qaeda I mean they're really getting ready to use this whole system against
[02:24:12.420 --> 02:24:16.180]  this Bob before we get into the economy the legislation that we've been talking
[02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:20.420]  about two months now mainstream news they're going oh it's good you know
[02:24:20.420 --> 02:24:24.420]  anybody we want can secretly be arrested by the Pentagon and no court is
[02:24:24.420 --> 02:24:28.980]  involved in your strip secretly of all your citizen rights and in in the
[02:24:28.980 --> 02:24:32.420]  prisons everywhere they're taking everybody's rights and it's just total
[02:24:32.420 --> 02:24:38.740]  oppression it's just total evil is taking the country over well it's going to
[02:24:38.740 --> 02:24:44.420]  continue to be that way I think we have to expect that and they're not going to
[02:24:44.420 --> 02:24:51.020]  back off one inches I just said a little while ago because they know if they
[02:24:51.020 --> 02:24:59.340]  lose they are not gonna survive whether it's in jail or otherwise and they're
[02:24:59.340 --> 02:25:06.020]  going for everything this time you know this is not 1348 in the fall of the
[02:25:06.020 --> 02:25:11.260]  Phoenician banking empire known as the Lombard system they exiled those people
[02:25:11.260 --> 02:25:15.860]  which was stupid but they did it and they went to Wales and they went to
[02:25:15.860 --> 02:25:24.580]  Amsterdam and Holland and they're still with us today the same families I'm not
[02:25:24.580 --> 02:25:29.420]  going to get away with it today because of communications we know almost all of
[02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:35.340]  them and if this thing blows up and they lose and we win they're going to lose
[02:25:35.340 --> 02:25:39.300]  their fortunes their power they'll end up in jail some of them will get hung for
[02:25:39.300 --> 02:25:47.820]  treason and so you can understand the frontal assault the takeover of society
[02:25:47.820 --> 02:25:54.580]  the attitude toward the American citizen on others as well I mean look at
[02:25:54.580 --> 02:26:01.820]  Greece people are rioting why it's not because of the dead it's because
[02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:07.620]  consecutive governments in Greece lied about it when assisted by Goldman Sachs
[02:26:07.620 --> 02:26:13.140]  to hide the reality of what was going on financially with the country and at the
[02:26:13.140 --> 02:26:21.180]  same time the bonds were sold to bankers in other countries and now the bankers
[02:26:21.180 --> 02:26:28.660]  want the public to pay the interest on the bonds that they bought this is a
[02:26:28.660 --> 02:26:34.260]  banker bailout in Europe it's a tarp for Europe it's the same thing we went
[02:26:34.260 --> 02:26:39.140]  through in the United States and it's being run by the Fed reserve and if
[02:26:39.140 --> 02:26:43.180]  they get a little short on money if a trillion is not enough the Fed's got a
[02:26:43.180 --> 02:26:47.820]  swap agreement again last time they had five hundred and eighty three billion
[02:26:47.820 --> 02:26:54.100]  dollars and what does that mean it means they can take that money and give it to
[02:26:54.100 --> 02:26:59.620]  five other central banks who in turn give the Fed to reserve their currencies
[02:26:59.620 --> 02:27:04.220]  in an equal amount what the Fed does and they're not going to tell you that
[02:27:04.220 --> 02:27:09.340]  this is they go into the currency markets when they want to make the Gala go up
[02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:15.860]  and they sell those other foreign countries currencies into the market and
[02:27:15.860 --> 02:27:21.300]  that boys and makes the dollar go up on the other hand and they're not going to
[02:27:21.300 --> 02:27:27.260]  tell you this all the other central banks with that money is in dollars they go
[02:27:27.260 --> 02:27:32.900]  to the Treasury auctions and they buy the Treasuries with that it's a circle of
[02:27:32.900 --> 02:27:38.700]  complete monetization it's a circle of inflation that will lead to hyper
[02:27:38.700 --> 02:27:44.300]  inflation now not only in the United States but in Europe as well and so
[02:27:44.300 --> 02:27:49.100]  that's what that's all about and that's why they're rioting in Greece because
[02:27:49.100 --> 02:27:53.780]  they say we didn't do this the bankers did it the people in office did it
[02:27:53.780 --> 02:27:59.540]  Goldman Sachs did it they never told us about this so we're not responsible and
[02:27:59.540 --> 02:28:05.380]  the same thing is going to happen in other European countries as we go along
[02:28:05.380 --> 02:28:13.500]  and something that has not come out yet no one else has talked about this
[02:28:13.500 --> 02:28:20.460]  Germany the German people are very unhappy about being involved in a bailout of
[02:28:20.460 --> 02:28:27.660]  Greece and last Saturday they had an election and the president's party in
[02:28:27.660 --> 02:28:34.020]  Germany the Chancellor it's called the CDU Christian Democratic Union lost a
[02:28:34.020 --> 02:28:39.900]  seat in the Rural Valley which is in Weston West Germany and it's around the
[02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:46.940]  city of Kuhn which in English is called Cologne and it was a
[02:28:46.940 --> 02:28:54.220]  devastating defeat because the CDU lost control of the Wunderstadt which is
[02:28:54.220 --> 02:28:59.700]  House representatives now what's going to happen the Germans are not going to
[02:28:59.700 --> 02:29:04.460]  get mad as unemployment goes up and they're going to riot too all right
[02:29:04.460 --> 02:29:07.260]  stay there Bob let's come back and discuss what happened with a thousand

[02:35:35.620 --> 02:35:40.380]  Bob Chapman okay you've got the floor until we go to calls at the end of this
[02:35:40.380 --> 02:35:43.540]  segment the next segment I want to hold you five minutes over if you can go
[02:35:43.540 --> 02:35:47.780]  through it go let's go back to three four years ago but interviewing you for
[02:35:47.780 --> 02:35:52.900]  10 since you came out of retirement but let's go back to three years ago you can
[02:35:52.900 --> 02:35:55.940]  give the dates of the forecaster 40-something pages you know twice a
[02:35:55.940 --> 02:36:00.140]  week I mean I remember you over and over again they're gonna implode the economy
[02:36:00.140 --> 02:36:05.780]  here with derivatives 2008-2009 or 10 you were saying that in 2006-2007 you
[02:36:05.780 --> 02:36:09.860]  said then Europe will start with Greece and Portugal and Spain then Italy I
[02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:15.500]  mean you just just like literal crystal ball so they've just declassified a
[02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:21.900]  Pentagon report from 2005 they knew this and that's actually up on Drudge
[02:36:21.900 --> 02:36:26.580]  report today but go over from the beginning and then where it's going
[02:36:26.580 --> 02:36:31.660]  next look into that look into that ball again so we have a good idea from your
[02:36:31.660 --> 02:36:38.300]  mind what's what's gonna unfold next well very quickly the members of the
[02:36:38.300 --> 02:36:42.140]  Eurozone there were 14 at that time which included
[02:36:42.140 --> 02:36:50.460]  Greece and Italy eventually and they had to prove their financial worth and you
[02:36:50.460 --> 02:36:56.100]  know public debt had to be less than 3d 3 the percent of GDP if it wasn't they
[02:36:56.100 --> 02:37:00.420]  would get fine of course along through the last 10 years they've all gone over
[02:37:00.420 --> 02:37:05.940]  that number so it's meaningless but the very point is that Greece and Italy
[02:37:05.940 --> 02:37:13.860]  should have never been allowed in and I can remember Prody from Italy who was
[02:37:13.860 --> 02:37:20.660]  making speeches in Germany to the effect that well we'll build a pipeline to send
[02:37:20.660 --> 02:37:25.460]  milk to Germany so that they'll have plenty of milk if you'll allow Greek
[02:37:25.460 --> 02:37:31.700]  Greece into the European Union well we found out in the interim some of the
[02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:37.460]  things I just talked to you about earlier and I think what they were up to and I
[02:37:37.460 --> 02:37:42.740]  said this on the program sometime maybe four or five months ago is that Greece
[02:37:42.740 --> 02:37:48.020]  was to be the point post a boy so to speak in the effort to bring down the
[02:37:48.020 --> 02:37:51.380]  entire world economy and they now admit that I mean the Greece thing was a
[02:37:51.380 --> 02:37:57.420]  smokescreen that's actually a Reuters headline for the European bailout well
[02:37:57.420 --> 02:38:06.660]  it didn't start that way it started they wanted to use Greece to extend it
[02:38:06.660 --> 02:38:12.860]  and Greece is broke there's no question and they wanted to extend the life of Greece for
[02:38:12.860 --> 02:38:16.500]  about a year a year and a half two years until they could get all their other
[02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:22.060]  chickens in line there's 19 of them and a number of them are outside the European
[02:38:22.060 --> 02:38:29.580]  Union of course as the United States and Japan and England and and and
[02:38:29.580 --> 02:38:36.500]  Venezuela and and Peru excuse me that Peru Venezuela Bolivia and Ecuador I
[02:38:36.500 --> 02:38:42.660]  think Uruguay may go the same way Argentinas broke again unfortunately
[02:38:42.660 --> 02:38:47.700]  Chile's been subject to terrible earthquakes which is beside that but
[02:38:47.700 --> 02:38:52.820]  there comes a 19 right now and it was my feeling that they wanted to bring them
[02:38:52.820 --> 02:38:56.580]  all together on the year and a half down the line two years down the line and
[02:38:56.580 --> 02:39:01.300]  everybody would devalue and everybody would default it would all be arranged
[02:39:01.300 --> 02:39:06.700]  they've done this before but they never expected that Greece would say hey no
[02:39:06.700 --> 02:39:11.060]  we've had enough we're not gonna do that we didn't know what they were doing and
[02:39:11.060 --> 02:39:16.860]  we really didn't and the bankers who made these loans these bonds that they
[02:39:16.860 --> 02:39:22.020]  purchased should have never done so and so we're not gonna pay and we're not
[02:39:22.020 --> 02:39:25.660]  gonna be involved and we're not gonna put me be put under austerity now you're
[02:39:25.660 --> 02:39:31.500]  hearing the same thing from Portugal and Spain and I was a rebellion against the
[02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:38.700]  the the the banker looting exactly and that's a perfect way to put it now the
[02:39:38.700 --> 02:39:42.380]  same thing is gonna happen in America but they're not quite ready for it yet
[02:39:42.380 --> 02:39:47.340]  but it will happen and so you're going to have this disgruntlement these
[02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:54.300]  demonstrations you may even see civil war and some countries and Greece is a
[02:39:54.300 --> 02:39:59.060]  good example of where that could happen at the same time we're talking about the
[02:39:59.060 --> 02:40:05.940]  trilateral Commission calling for third world war because they want to diffuse
[02:40:05.940 --> 02:40:13.860]  and deflect the attention from their efforts to bring down the world
[02:40:13.860 --> 02:40:18.820]  economically and financially but at the same time blame it on the wall with Iran
[02:40:18.820 --> 02:40:24.620]  or whoever they're gonna attack and that's what they're up to and their their
[02:40:24.620 --> 02:40:30.340]  plans have been thrown up in the air Greece has screwed the whole thing up
[02:40:30.340 --> 02:40:35.020]  put up so that now they're gonna have to come up with all this money and the
[02:40:35.020 --> 02:40:39.020]  trillion's not gonna do it I promise you of which 65 billions coming from the
[02:40:39.020 --> 02:40:43.260]  United States via the IMF so you American citizens out there should be
[02:40:43.260 --> 02:40:53.140]  happy to know that you're helping to bail recalcitrant countries in at least in
[02:40:53.140 --> 02:41:00.700]  Europe at this time and you know what is really sad is Estonia or is on the
[02:41:00.700 --> 02:41:07.140]  verge of collapse financially and they're ready to join the eurozone which
[02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:12.420]  I don't think they should at this time but there's 19 nations and they're
[02:41:12.420 --> 02:41:16.500]  trying to keep them all afloat now because they're at the underestimate
[02:41:16.500 --> 02:41:21.980]  what the Greeks did and so they got they're gonna have to continue to pull
[02:41:21.980 --> 02:41:27.900]  money into that situation and it's gonna cause hyperinflation in Europe and
[02:41:27.900 --> 02:41:32.300]  we're gonna have hyperinflation in the United States and eventually it'll turn
[02:41:32.300 --> 02:41:38.060]  into total deflation and that's the way we're headed and as far as you you
[02:41:38.060 --> 02:41:44.380]  mentioned what went on two weeks ago my my take is and this is that to do with
[02:41:44.380 --> 02:41:50.420]  the plunge in the market my takes at the same as Max Kaisers it was a government
[02:41:50.420 --> 02:41:58.420]  operation it was a terrorist attack on the people who invest in the US stock
[02:41:58.420 --> 02:42:05.140]  market and the reasons why they showed their power probably using Goldman in
[02:42:05.140 --> 02:42:09.340]  others to knock the market down by sucking the liquidity out of the
[02:42:09.340 --> 02:42:14.260]  derivative market and they wanted to tell Congress look this is what we can do
[02:42:14.260 --> 02:42:24.500]  and if you don't stop a real audit of the Fed and if you don't if you try to
[02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:32.020]  break up the two big to fail banks this is what we're gonna do to you and of
[02:42:32.020 --> 02:42:36.180]  course Congress does and they were paid off to does exactly what they're told
[02:42:36.180 --> 02:42:45.340]  and so we know have some rinky dink one audit situation on the Fed whether
[02:42:45.340 --> 02:42:48.940]  really not gonna look at anything important Ron Paul has now put out a
[02:42:48.940 --> 02:42:53.220]  statement yesterday in fact guys print that again Ron Paul says Sanders sold
[02:42:53.220 --> 02:42:56.900]  out as the article I know you printed it for me when I can't find it here I want
[02:42:56.900 --> 02:42:59.820]  to read his statement he said Bernie Sanders completely sold out and this is
[02:42:59.820 --> 02:43:03.980]  a light wash and so when Grayson runs around you know he's showing us true
[02:43:03.980 --> 02:43:09.180]  color saying we beat the Fed that's a load of baloney well he thinks that in
[02:43:09.180 --> 02:43:13.340]  the joint committee that they're gonna be able to add amendments and that
[02:43:13.340 --> 02:43:20.580]  is possible but not really probable but we'll see I wish him the best Grayson
[02:43:20.580 --> 02:43:26.460]  and is it funny baloney we'll find out what we get there whether our chances
[02:43:26.460 --> 02:43:33.060]  of winning are very small where do we go from here you'll see other terrorist
[02:43:33.060 --> 02:43:38.700]  attacks in the market there's no question this was a Goldman Morgan
[02:43:38.700 --> 02:43:45.340]  Deutsche Bank City group HSBC attack they know exactly what was going on I
[02:43:45.340 --> 02:43:51.580]  mean on this program I told you that I knew that all of that group were super
[02:43:51.580 --> 02:43:58.500]  long the dollar between 74 and 76 on the USDX it's now trading at 86 and they
[02:43:58.500 --> 02:44:03.140]  are long and their leverage is probably a hundred to one they're making
[02:44:03.140 --> 02:44:08.020]  gazillions of dollars because they knew that that was going to happen in Europe
[02:44:08.020 --> 02:44:12.460]  because they planned it that way and it's the same thing when the market dropped
[02:44:12.460 --> 02:44:17.580]  and everybody got wiped up out of their stop-loss positions they turned around
[02:44:17.580 --> 02:44:22.980]  and brought the market right back 700 points who did that the same people who
[02:44:22.980 --> 02:44:27.500]  took it down in behalf of the United States government and the Fed reserve so
[02:44:27.500 --> 02:44:34.580]  that Congress wouldn't even think of not doing what they were told so where is
[02:44:34.580 --> 02:44:38.460]  all this going what's the next phase where do you see it breaking out next
[02:44:38.460 --> 02:44:44.620]  how will they respond well I think the markets going down and I think they're
[02:44:44.620 --> 02:44:51.780]  going to allow it to go down not precipitously but like you throw a flat
[02:44:51.780 --> 02:44:57.300]  rock in the water and as it goes down it ladles back and forth until it hits the
[02:44:57.300 --> 02:45:03.700]  bottom and that's the approach they're going to take and in the markets they've
[02:45:03.700 --> 02:45:07.260]  got to take them down they can't maintain them at the levels that they're at and
[02:45:07.260 --> 02:45:15.420]  so where's the doubt going to go it went from 11,200 it's 10,600 it was down
[02:45:15.420 --> 02:45:22.860]  300 points today earlier when we started this program 45 minutes ago and and now
[02:45:22.860 --> 02:45:28.820]  it's off 199 points and they said oh we need 156 billion when he's 600 billion
[02:45:28.820 --> 02:45:32.500]  we need a trillion by Monday then Tuesday they said a trillion is not enough
[02:45:32.500 --> 02:45:37.140]  you know the trillion Europe loses its balance I mean this is unraveling quickly
[02:45:37.140 --> 02:45:44.340]  it is it really is and as I said the thing that people are thinking about in
[02:45:44.340 --> 02:45:48.300]  Europe is Germany another thing they're not thinking about financially and
[02:45:48.300 --> 02:45:54.100]  economically is Russia and I think you're going to see real trouble in
[02:45:54.100 --> 02:45:59.980]  Europe not only on the people who are receiving funds who are going to say we
[02:45:59.980 --> 02:46:04.300]  don't want to get bailed out and then the people who are being forced the
[02:46:04.300 --> 02:46:10.420]  citizens of the other countries and don't forget it's not just Europe the IMF
[02:46:10.420 --> 02:46:16.740]  represents I don't know 150 countries they're all paying you know it's just
[02:46:16.740 --> 02:46:22.620]  like you know give them a can of gasoline and a match and you know let's
[02:46:22.620 --> 02:46:27.060]  turn the world into a conflagration economically and financially and that's
[02:46:27.060 --> 02:46:32.980]  what they're doing it's to create chaos and out of that create a new world
[02:46:32.980 --> 02:46:39.340]  order well you're absolutely right and now we hear Israel prime for war on Iran
[02:46:39.340 --> 02:46:45.540]  Netanyahu deputy says that's Reuters Russia warns us against unilateral Iran
[02:46:45.540 --> 02:46:52.620]  sanctions which Ron Paul has said is an act of war just so much is going on
[02:46:52.620 --> 02:46:55.700]  separately I want to get into the war situation a minute and go to calls
[02:46:55.700 --> 02:46:59.260]  because again a war as we know always comes in the middle of one of their
[02:46:59.260 --> 02:47:01.980]  takeovers because it makes everybody rally around the government even though
[02:47:01.980 --> 02:47:05.940]  they're raping them this is from the Daily Paul other publications it says
[02:47:05.940 --> 02:47:12.460]  video update from dr. Paul Sanders sold out on audit the Fed amendment here's a
[02:47:12.460 --> 02:47:18.300]  transcript of it Bernie Sanders has sold out and has sided with Chris Dodd to
[02:47:18.300 --> 02:47:22.540]  gut the audit the Fed in the Senate his compromise is what the administration and
[02:47:22.540 --> 02:47:27.740]  banking interests want they'll allow the tarp in the TLF to be audited but no
[02:47:27.740 --> 02:47:31.420]  transparency or monetary policy decisions discount window operations or
[02:47:31.420 --> 02:47:35.500]  agreement with foreign central banks we need to take action to stop this that's
[02:47:35.500 --> 02:47:38.620]  where I'm pulled two days ago I just wanted to go back over that so just
[02:47:38.620 --> 02:47:43.380]  absolute disgusting behavior going on in the Congress I mean it gets us through
[02:47:43.380 --> 02:47:47.660]  them either we get these banks out of our lives and under control or they're
[02:47:47.660 --> 02:47:50.620]  going to take everything over and we now see that they're laughing at us saying
[02:47:50.620 --> 02:47:54.940]  the good times are over ha ha ha it's totally sickening let's go to some
[02:47:54.940 --> 02:48:02.380]  calls for Bob Chapman Jim and Oregon you're on the air great job Alex what
[02:48:02.380 --> 02:48:07.820]  one thing can the American people do to agitate or what one policy should they
[02:48:07.820 --> 02:48:14.460]  agitate for to try and stop these bankers Bob well I think you can go to
[02:48:14.460 --> 02:48:18.220]  your congressman and let him know you know what they're doing in siding with
[02:48:18.220 --> 02:48:24.580]  the bankers and in a voting tarp in and things like that but the best way is to
[02:48:24.580 --> 02:48:31.020]  kick them all out of of Congress in the next election and you know this this
[02:48:31.020 --> 02:48:39.060]  probably half the house house seats that belong to people who are getting paid
[02:48:39.060 --> 02:48:47.020]  off by the banking and Wall Street cabal they're up for grabs easy but you
[02:48:47.020 --> 02:48:52.820]  know if you work hard at it and you let the people know we could probably get
[02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:57.340]  new people doesn't matter who they are hopefully they conservative yeah whatever
[02:48:57.340 --> 02:49:02.780]  party they're in we got to get them in there because even if they want to buy
[02:49:02.780 --> 02:49:06.980]  them off it's gonna cost them a lot of money it's gonna take them at least a
[02:49:06.980 --> 02:49:12.740]  year to be able to force them one way or the other to go back and do with the
[02:49:12.740 --> 02:49:16.460]  bad guys they were in there get kicked out for it's right it takes time let me
[02:49:16.460 --> 02:49:22.220]  add a caveat to this and Ron Paul said this it's in my film matrix of evil you
[02:49:22.220 --> 02:49:27.060]  know back in 2003 they're going to implode the economy by design to bring in
[02:49:27.060 --> 02:49:30.060]  their world government and the same banks that have engineered this will then
[02:49:30.060 --> 02:49:35.660]  pose as a saviors we're in a race that during the crisis period we educate
[02:49:35.660 --> 02:49:38.860]  enough people beforehand and during the crisis to understand that the banks
[02:49:38.860 --> 02:49:42.380]  engineered this which is in the Goldman Sachs emails so that we can come in with
[02:49:42.380 --> 02:49:47.540]  our real constitutional solution so the average yuppie isn't laughing and sucking
[02:49:47.540 --> 02:49:52.100]  their thumb as much as usual and acting cool and arrogant you know they're now
[02:49:52.100 --> 02:49:56.700]  finally kind of listening so you got to say listen I know you're slack-jawed and
[02:49:56.700 --> 02:50:00.300]  think you're cool and and you think it's you know weak to care about America and
[02:50:00.300 --> 02:50:04.340]  be involved but you better forget your you know your basketball finals for a
[02:50:04.340 --> 02:50:09.140]  little while you've been lied to they are going to implode the economy further
[02:50:09.140 --> 02:50:14.580]  we are in a depression you know this is all a fraud the new world orders real
[02:50:14.580 --> 02:50:19.380]  you better get up off your fat patoot now they're still gonna laugh at you
[02:50:19.380 --> 02:50:23.020]  publicly because they have a mental illness of weak people they believe if
[02:50:23.020 --> 02:50:27.260]  they laugh at something it gives them power over it but once they're really
[02:50:27.260 --> 02:50:31.940]  hurting bad later those seeds you planted in their brain are gonna sprout

[02:54:12.900 --> 02:54:18.700]  mean this is the key to this whole thing we're giving you the exposure and
[02:54:18.700 --> 02:54:24.540]  programs like this we're giving you the tools Alex says all these videos and
[02:54:24.540 --> 02:54:30.300]  DVDs buy and copy of them whatever and I know many of you are handing them out
[02:54:30.300 --> 02:54:34.700]  we need lots more people we've got to wake up the American public before
[02:54:34.700 --> 02:54:39.180]  November so they'll understand that they got to get rid of these quirks and
[02:54:39.180 --> 02:54:46.220]  discreetings and in the process make them understand that the core of the
[02:54:46.220 --> 02:54:51.500]  power of the Illuminati in America and throughout the world is the Federal
[02:54:51.500 --> 02:54:56.300]  Reserve system and the Bank of England and other central banks and if people
[02:54:56.300 --> 02:55:00.060]  can understand that they'll know how they're getting robbed look at who's
[02:55:00.060 --> 02:55:03.460]  calling all the shots look at who's behind everything it's now out in the
[02:55:03.460 --> 02:55:07.260]  open and they're saying world government run by them there's no more time folks
[02:55:07.260 --> 02:55:11.140]  no more time oh I heard it's kooky to talk about this read the newspaper
[02:55:11.140 --> 02:55:15.140]  they're just doing this out in the open let's go to calls here let's talk to
[02:55:15.140 --> 02:55:19.980]  John and Canada than James Nicky and others you're on the air John yeah hi
[02:55:19.980 --> 02:55:26.340]  yeah Alex great interview with David Paul Hammer I I learned a lot from that
[02:55:26.340 --> 02:55:31.220]  and Bob over many of the articles I have one question regarding something I've
[02:55:31.220 --> 02:55:37.060]  read is the Merse regards the mortgages in the United States I'd just like to
[02:55:37.060 --> 02:55:42.420]  hear your opinion about that well the foreclosure ratio is going to continue to
[02:55:42.420 --> 02:55:47.860]  increase we'll probably lose seven million homeowners this year it'll be
[02:55:47.860 --> 02:55:55.020]  just as bad the next two years and it may go a little bit longer and then
[02:55:55.020 --> 02:56:00.140]  we'll probably be on a bottom probably of the loans that are out there that
[02:56:00.140 --> 02:56:06.300]  haven't been foreclosed on 60 to 70 percent of going under I know that's a
[02:56:06.300 --> 02:56:11.900]  high figure but I've been right before lots and lots of times and that's what
[02:56:11.900 --> 02:56:16.500]  this thing's going to end up and I wrote an article seven years ago and I said
[02:56:16.500 --> 02:56:20.900]  the federal government has allowed for Annie and Freddie to be bankrupt which
[02:56:20.900 --> 02:56:25.180]  they were and you saw what happened since then there after the complete
[02:56:25.180 --> 02:56:30.420]  control eventually of the housing market so they can tell people where to live
[02:56:30.420 --> 02:56:34.620]  and how to live and yeah they're taking everything over you know the smaller
[02:56:34.620 --> 02:56:39.820]  banks that aren't globalist the car industries the factories manufacturing
[02:56:39.820 --> 02:56:43.860]  through the carbon taxes they're going ahead with even a car builders a home
[02:56:43.860 --> 02:56:47.500]  builders they're now announcing that they're going to demolish at least a
[02:56:47.500 --> 02:56:53.180]  third of Detroit 10,000 homes the next month I mean this this is this is this
[02:56:53.180 --> 02:56:59.220]  is incredible it certainly is and remember what this is is
[02:56:59.220 --> 02:57:06.780]  corporatist fascism the marriage of large transnational corporations finance
[02:57:06.780 --> 02:57:12.620]  banking and government it's the same thing that we saw and you should go and
[02:57:12.620 --> 02:57:19.100]  read the real history of the late 1920s 30s and 40s in Germany and Italy and you
[02:57:19.100 --> 02:57:23.940]  find out exactly what's going to happen here and it's not gonna be pretty and
[02:57:23.940 --> 02:57:27.020]  they're gonna stage terror attacks to demonize the American people and
[02:57:27.020 --> 02:57:30.460]  claim that we're terrorists so nobody can protest and demonstrate so they can
[02:57:30.460 --> 02:57:34.220]  arrest whoever they want it's all being publicly announced it is unspeakably
[02:57:34.220 --> 02:57:41.700]  dark so real that it doesn't even shake me to my core it it it energizes me to
[02:57:41.700 --> 02:57:45.780]  just stand up against them and we have no choice they're not giving us quarter
[02:57:45.780 --> 02:57:48.980]  for those who don't know what quarter is you know sometimes they would have a
[02:57:48.980 --> 02:57:54.460]  duel and it would just with swords in Europe you know 500 years ago and they
[02:57:54.460 --> 02:57:59.300]  would say in this fight are we going to give quarter meaning if I get you on the
[02:57:59.300 --> 02:58:06.420]  ground of slashed you off do we give quarter vice versa and no no quarter
[02:58:06.420 --> 02:58:12.780]  no get no you know no quarter given no quarter taken and this is this is it

[03:00:53.220 --> 03:00:57.540]  is not off the subject but this immigration this boycotting from
[03:00:57.540 --> 03:01:01.860]  cities to cities about arizona do you see this as a
[03:01:01.860 --> 03:01:05.540]  part of the financial plan to put the states against each other or just a
[03:01:05.540 --> 03:01:10.100]  smokescreen so we can keep an eye on that while they steal our money
[03:01:10.100 --> 03:01:13.620]  about states against each other but i do know
[03:01:13.620 --> 03:01:19.700]  of people against each other uh... it's it's it could create in confusion
[03:01:19.700 --> 03:01:24.700]  sixty five percent of americans agree with what arizona has done
[03:01:24.700 --> 03:01:25.660]  and so
[03:01:25.660 --> 03:01:28.380]  and that's pretty strong backing from
[03:01:28.380 --> 03:01:29.620]  the general
[03:01:29.620 --> 03:01:33.740]  popular some polls are eighty percent but yeah but some others are sixty four

[03:02:07.140 --> 03:02:09.460]  hi uh... i've been
[03:02:09.460 --> 03:02:13.140]  uh... has been to call just because of the information that i have
[03:02:13.140 --> 03:02:16.460]  i uh... if you talk about the hypothalamus
[03:02:16.460 --> 03:02:20.780]  alex and you're right when you say that humans have a governor in the brain
[03:02:20.780 --> 03:02:22.460]  it is the hypothalamus
[03:02:22.460 --> 03:02:26.980]  and the hypothalamus is the gatekeeper which denies or allows access to our
[03:02:26.980 --> 03:02:28.940]  critical thinking brain
[03:02:28.940 --> 03:02:33.500]  and i have found a way to manually reset and reboot the hypothalamus
[03:02:33.500 --> 03:02:35.580]  which forces and allows
[03:02:35.580 --> 03:02:36.980]  reason and logic
[03:02:36.980 --> 03:02:40.580]  well i mean they admit that that's what florida tax me that's i've had scientists

[03:02:54.220 --> 03:02:55.700]  only three
[03:02:55.700 --> 03:02:58.100]  and uh... i had figured out
[03:02:58.100 --> 03:02:59.860]  how all that worked in the brain
[03:02:59.860 --> 03:03:01.340]  by helping myself
[03:03:01.340 --> 03:03:05.180]  and i stopped myself from having the third neck surgery and unherniated a real

[03:06:41.540 --> 03:06:44.740]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more
[03:06:44.740 --> 03:06:46.500]  valuable than silver or gold

[03:08:15.340 --> 03:08:18.060]  and so we'll be talking to one of those gentlemen
[03:08:18.060 --> 03:08:21.340]  who talked one of the trilateral commission members here in a moment
[03:08:21.340 --> 03:08:22.800]  but going back
[03:08:22.800 --> 03:08:26.300]  uh... to the caller in florida to get bob chapman's take on it for stations
[03:08:26.300 --> 03:08:27.700]  that just joined us
[03:08:27.700 --> 03:08:29.180]  if the call christ was saying
[03:08:29.180 --> 03:08:32.740]  where do i get documentation that we're in a financial meltdown of that
[03:08:32.740 --> 03:08:35.100]  it were in danger of a total depression
[03:08:35.100 --> 03:08:38.020]  i mean here it is president nicole sarkozy threatened to pull france out
[03:08:38.020 --> 03:08:40.220]  of europe you know what's the this means
[03:08:40.220 --> 03:08:42.900]  that's now the wall street journal that the euro as a good chance of totally
[03:08:42.900 --> 03:08:44.220]  collapsing
[03:08:44.220 --> 03:08:47.180]  i mean that there's trillions of dollars trillions and trillions tens of
[03:08:47.180 --> 03:08:48.580]  trillions hundreds of trillions
[03:08:48.580 --> 03:08:51.940]  some like uh... economist harpley says it's one point five quadrillion
[03:08:51.940 --> 03:08:55.940]  uh... this is hundreds of times all the real money in real assets in the world
[03:08:55.940 --> 03:09:00.700]  uh... it's a weapon system there they're announcing world government it's a
[03:09:00.700 --> 03:09:01.980]  financial takeover
[03:09:01.980 --> 03:09:05.540]  u.s. faces same problems is greece's bank of england may totally collapse
[03:09:05.540 --> 03:09:06.780]  one and guardian
[03:09:06.780 --> 03:09:10.660]  one in telegraph it's all it's all right here
[03:09:10.660 --> 03:09:13.660]  bob i mean i guess if you're talking to the average american
[03:09:13.660 --> 03:09:16.740]  who doesn't know what fractional reserve banking is what's the quickest easiest
[03:09:16.740 --> 03:09:19.540]  way to explain to him what's happening
[03:09:19.540 --> 03:09:23.780]  i haven't read the forecaster i think that you know before the break
[03:09:23.780 --> 03:09:26.420]  but it's all there everything that they need to know
[03:09:26.420 --> 03:09:28.940]  absolutely the international forecaster dot com but
[03:09:28.940 --> 03:09:30.680]  i mean we've been giving this out
[03:09:30.680 --> 03:09:33.540]  and we've been reading the news and this is this is world government's being
[03:09:33.540 --> 03:09:35.020]  openly announced in
[03:09:35.020 --> 03:09:38.220]  the southern property law center rights article saying i'm crazy and ron paul's
[03:09:38.220 --> 03:09:40.420]  crazy and we're dangerous and none of it exists
[03:09:40.420 --> 03:09:43.300]  and then you'll turn on cnn they're announcing world governments good the
[03:09:43.300 --> 03:09:44.860]  banks are taking over uh...
[03:09:44.860 --> 03:09:48.820]  i mean it's it's insanity chris does that answer your question
[03:09:48.820 --> 03:09:52.300]  well yeah it kind of does but i'm also kind of looking for uh...
[03:09:52.300 --> 03:09:56.540]  just like i'm i'm trying to show uh... my my mom how important
[03:09:56.540 --> 03:09:59.340]  gold and silver is because i i really don't know how to describe it
[03:09:59.340 --> 03:10:03.060]  and i'm and trying to find the likelihood of how okay how
[03:10:03.060 --> 03:10:07.740]  how likely info it inflation is or how uh... or hyperinflation okay let me
[03:10:07.740 --> 03:10:09.860]  answer that you bob's take quickly
[03:10:09.860 --> 03:10:12.780]  this is elementary
[03:10:12.780 --> 03:10:16.740]  nineteen eighty inflation numbers this is every reason this is mainstream
[03:10:16.740 --> 03:10:19.100]  twenty three hundred twenty five hundred dollars an ounce is what it should
[03:10:19.100 --> 03:10:19.780]  be
[03:10:19.780 --> 03:10:21.620]  and that's what cooked inflation numbers
[03:10:21.620 --> 03:10:24.940]  they cook the unemployment it's really twenty two they say it's ten
[03:10:24.940 --> 03:10:28.100]  they cook the unemployment uh... they cook inflation
[03:10:28.100 --> 03:10:30.380]  uh... it it's simple gold and silver
[03:10:30.380 --> 03:10:31.580]  have intrinsic
[03:10:31.580 --> 03:10:34.860]  value always have for six thousand years
[03:10:34.860 --> 03:10:37.940]  uh... and
[03:10:37.940 --> 03:10:39.780]  that's why you see it going up
[03:10:39.780 --> 03:10:41.660]  bob shatman
[03:10:41.660 --> 03:10:43.380]  uh... and that's correct
[03:10:43.380 --> 03:10:44.940]  and the only people who can
[03:10:44.940 --> 03:10:49.260]  create inflation is a central bank like the fed reserve
[03:10:49.260 --> 03:10:53.540]  and i cover that in the international forecaster every single day
[03:10:53.540 --> 03:10:58.180]  when i go over what happened in the market that day
[03:10:58.180 --> 03:11:00.740]  if you have any further questions
[03:11:00.740 --> 03:11:02.780]  just get a copy of the forecaster

[03:12:44.780 --> 03:12:48.320]  i mean it's so elementary when you studied it gold and silver is what
[03:12:48.320 --> 03:12:52.740]  governments corporations europe all-time records in europe all-time records in
[03:12:52.740 --> 03:12:53.980]  the united states
[03:12:53.980 --> 03:12:54.960]  eight hundred
[03:12:54.960 --> 03:12:57.220]  six eight six two two three seven
[03:12:57.220 --> 03:13:00.580]  and you're paying a price because ted bought a bunch of this when it was lower
[03:13:00.580 --> 03:13:02.300]  he's passing that savings on
[03:13:02.300 --> 03:13:07.100]  eight hundred six eight six two two three seven
[03:13:07.100 --> 03:13:10.200]  ladies and gentlemen take advantage of that today
[03:13:10.200 --> 03:13:11.300]  don't wait
[03:13:11.300 --> 03:13:13.420]  uh... bob
[03:13:13.420 --> 03:13:17.700]  in closing where do you see gold uh... going in the next six months to a year
[03:13:17.700 --> 03:13:19.180]  straight up
[03:13:19.180 --> 03:13:20.620]  i'm looking for
[03:13:20.620 --> 03:13:21.780]  we've had to break out
[03:13:21.780 --> 03:13:24.100]  we might hesitate at thirteen hundred
[03:13:24.100 --> 03:13:26.460]  uh... it's just a technical thing
[03:13:26.460 --> 03:13:30.860]  uh... fifteen hundred two sixteen thousand sixteen hundred fifty
[03:13:30.860 --> 03:13:33.180]  uh... is where we're we should be
[03:13:33.180 --> 03:13:36.780]  uh... shortly enough not shortly by the end of the year
[03:13:36.780 --> 03:13:38.060]  so that alone
[03:13:38.060 --> 03:13:39.820]  is worth buying for
[03:13:39.820 --> 03:13:41.620]  and if we get
[03:13:41.620 --> 03:13:43.260]  the opportunity to go
[03:13:43.260 --> 03:13:45.060]  the fifteen or sixteen
[03:13:45.060 --> 03:13:46.820]  in the next month or so
[03:13:46.820 --> 03:13:50.820]  that we may see twenty five hundred to three thousand by the end of the year
[03:13:50.820 --> 03:13:54.460]  gold is going to seven to seventy five hundred dollars
[03:13:54.460 --> 03:13:55.660]  an ounce
[03:13:55.660 --> 03:13:58.020]  before the end of next year
[03:13:58.020 --> 03:14:00.700]  i mean the world is upside down
[03:14:00.700 --> 03:14:03.960]  never mind the inflation that's going on
[03:14:03.960 --> 03:14:05.860]  wait
[03:14:05.860 --> 03:14:09.860]  well i'll say this i personally bought gold was three hundred bucks an ounce and i've done quite
[03:14:09.860 --> 03:14:12.860]  well i don't buy as an investment as an emergency backup
[03:14:12.860 --> 03:14:14.900]  but a lot of people do get it as an investment
[03:14:14.900 --> 03:14:17.020]  and it's come out and see span hearings
[03:14:17.020 --> 03:14:19.700]  that they are manipulating the gold price you don't think they can be
[03:14:19.700 --> 03:14:20.700]  successful to
[03:14:20.700 --> 03:14:21.820]  uh... but i mean
[03:14:21.820 --> 03:14:25.940]  again i'm at kitco looking at the five-year graph it's going straight up
[03:14:25.940 --> 03:14:29.620]  they can do a little manipulations but every time it goes back up higher
[03:14:29.620 --> 03:14:31.320]  so if you see the trend
[03:14:31.320 --> 03:14:36.660]  i mean it's straight up
[03:14:36.660 --> 03:14:39.660]  well bob chapman i appreciate you joining us today will talk to you again
[03:14:39.660 --> 03:14:41.740]  uh... for a full hour or even more

[03:15:08.180 --> 03:15:11.820]  first i want to play a video of the trial lateral commission meeting
[03:15:11.820 --> 03:15:13.940]  a little over a week ago
[03:15:13.940 --> 03:15:15.980]  before the european implosion
[03:15:15.980 --> 03:15:18.660]  in dublin iran and and we are changed
[03:15:18.660 --> 03:15:19.940]  as david rockefeller
[03:15:19.940 --> 03:15:23.260]  was going into the hotel for the secret of meeting
[03:15:23.260 --> 03:15:27.600]  uh... and this is what uh... we are change ironland in dublin
[03:15:27.600 --> 03:15:29.700]  uh... had to say to the king pan
[03:15:29.700 --> 03:15:33.220]  uh... the banking new world order system
[03:15:33.220 --> 03:15:35.220]  rockefeller we know what you're doing
[03:15:35.220 --> 03:15:37.420]  we know what you're doing to the world
[03:15:37.420 --> 03:15:40.180]  rockefeller you're no longer will never come in
[03:15:40.180 --> 03:15:41.980]  you're running out of time
[03:15:41.980 --> 03:15:42.980]  scumbag
[03:15:42.980 --> 03:15:44.060]  you've rushed it
[03:15:44.060 --> 03:15:45.620]  you're screwed up
[03:15:45.620 --> 03:15:48.460]  you're not going to stop the irish rockefeller you're scumbag
[03:15:48.460 --> 03:15:50.020]  we are the irish

[03:15:50.980 --> 03:15:53.460]  we know what you're up to rockefeller
[03:15:53.460 --> 03:16:00.460]  you're not going to come on down
[03:16:01.380 --> 03:16:03.940]  and then they go on to challenge the police and explain how they're selling
[03:16:03.940 --> 03:16:05.180]  their people out
[03:16:05.180 --> 03:16:07.740]  in fact if you still have a cute up at that point let's play the rest of it i
[03:16:07.740 --> 03:16:11.740]  shouldn't cut it off
[03:16:11.740 --> 03:16:13.740]  hope you're happy working for that warfight
[03:16:13.740 --> 03:16:16.740]  do you know what that guy who you're protecting does?
[03:16:16.740 --> 03:16:21.740]  hope to feel that working for a mass murder
[03:16:21.740 --> 03:16:23.740]  it's like the eugenics movement
[03:16:23.740 --> 03:16:25.740]  from the nazis
[03:16:25.740 --> 03:16:27.740]  monopolizes every business
[03:16:27.740 --> 03:16:30.740]  what sort of world you're making for your kids?
[03:16:30.740 --> 03:16:32.740]  what kind of world you're making for your kids?
[03:16:32.740 --> 03:16:33.740]  that's enough
[03:16:33.740 --> 03:16:35.740]  and it goes on from there a lot of background noise
[03:16:35.740 --> 03:16:37.740]  uh... but that was we are changed
[03:16:37.740 --> 03:16:40.740]  now neil foster from the sovereign independent
[03:16:40.740 --> 03:16:43.740]  he just had his own press badge and just moseyed on in
[03:16:43.740 --> 03:16:45.740]  uh... to the meeting
[03:16:45.740 --> 03:16:47.740]  and i've moseyed into high security meetings as well
[03:16:47.740 --> 03:16:49.740]  so has jim tuckerman at times
[03:16:49.740 --> 03:16:51.740]  shot it in portugal for it

[03:17:14.740 --> 03:17:17.740]  we are not your slaves
[03:17:17.740 --> 03:17:20.740]  i guess that was a shorter clip there's actually a longer one online
[03:17:20.740 --> 03:17:22.740]  where where it goes on and on
[03:17:22.740 --> 03:17:25.740]  uh... well we'll try to pull it up but uh...

[03:17:38.740 --> 03:17:40.740]  we're about to go to break but
[03:17:40.740 --> 03:17:43.740]  he was able at the conference of the night before the conference
[03:17:43.740 --> 03:17:45.740]  to talk to one of the russian members
[03:17:45.740 --> 03:17:47.740]  of the trilateral commission
[03:17:47.740 --> 03:17:50.740]  uh... and uh... tell us how you did this
[03:17:50.740 --> 03:17:52.740]  tell us how you got in where you talk to him
[03:17:52.740 --> 03:17:56.740]  we'll come back in after the break and cover exactly what he said
[03:17:56.740 --> 03:17:58.740]  hi alex thanks for having me on
[03:17:58.740 --> 03:18:00.740]  thank you for your courage
[03:18:00.740 --> 03:18:03.740]  you're an inspiration to us all tell us what he said
[03:18:03.740 --> 03:18:05.740]  um... we got to the
[03:18:05.740 --> 03:18:07.740]  when we got to the hotel
[03:18:07.740 --> 03:18:10.740]  we were outside hanging out outside that for the whole day
[03:18:10.740 --> 03:18:13.740]  waiting to see if we could get an interview with any of them when they were coming out
[03:18:13.740 --> 03:18:15.740]  we tried talking to a couple of them beforehand
[03:18:15.740 --> 03:18:18.740]  they weren't really that interested in talking to us so
[03:18:18.740 --> 03:18:21.740]  we just said we were students from down to college down the road
[03:18:21.740 --> 03:18:24.740]  and we were just wondering what was happening in the hotel
[03:18:24.740 --> 03:18:27.740]  and he said they were deciding the future of the world
[03:18:27.740 --> 03:18:30.740]  and one of the things they were discussing on the agenda was
[03:18:30.740 --> 03:18:32.740]  the greek financial crisis
[03:18:32.740 --> 03:18:35.740]  so we asked him a couple questions about that
[03:18:35.740 --> 03:18:38.740]  and he was more than willing to give us information
[03:18:38.740 --> 03:18:41.740]  when he thought we were just students
[03:18:41.740 --> 03:18:43.740]  and I said to him
[03:18:43.740 --> 03:18:46.740]  a good solution for the greek financial crisis
[03:18:46.740 --> 03:18:49.740]  would probably have been a world currency
[03:18:49.740 --> 03:18:52.740]  which he jumped at the chance to talk about it
[03:18:52.740 --> 03:18:55.740]  he was saying a world currency is something they all want
[03:18:55.740 --> 03:18:58.740]  but it would require a global central bank
[03:18:58.740 --> 03:19:01.740]  to be implemented by a global government
[03:19:01.740 --> 03:19:04.740]  which I mean we played along with this
[03:19:04.740 --> 03:19:07.740]  and we said of course that's what we all want
[03:19:07.740 --> 03:19:09.740]  and he said that's the dream
[03:19:09.740 --> 03:19:12.740]  and he said that's the world trying to achieve
[03:19:12.740 --> 03:19:14.740]  if this country likes it
[03:19:14.740 --> 03:19:16.740]  well let's go over who this guy is
[03:19:16.740 --> 03:19:17.740]  how you ran into him
[03:19:17.740 --> 03:19:19.740]  how you knew he was trilateral commission
[03:19:19.740 --> 03:19:21.740]  I also want to get the other newspaper guy on
[03:19:21.740 --> 03:19:24.740]  he went in and confronted him inside the building
[03:19:24.740 --> 03:19:26.740]  just amazing information
[03:19:26.740 --> 03:19:28.740]  stay with us quick break sir

[03:19:39.740 --> 03:19:40.740]  tyranny is here
[03:19:40.740 --> 03:19:44.740]  the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality
[03:19:44.740 --> 03:19:47.740]  it really says that the state is god
[03:19:47.740 --> 03:19:49.740]  the united states is now recognized globally
[03:19:49.740 --> 03:19:52.740]  as one of the most oppressive police states on earth
[03:19:52.740 --> 03:19:55.740]  this film conclusively proves the existence
[03:19:55.740 --> 03:19:57.740]  of a secret network of FEMA cares
[03:19:57.740 --> 03:19:59.740]  now being expanded nationwide
[03:19:59.740 --> 03:20:02.740]  this documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[03:20:02.740 --> 03:20:05.740]  has established an old powerful shadow state
[03:20:05.740 --> 03:20:07.740]  police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths
[03:20:07.740 --> 03:20:09.740]  to which our republic has fallen
[03:20:09.740 --> 03:20:13.740]  prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship
[03:20:13.740 --> 03:20:16.740]  body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies
[03:20:16.740 --> 03:20:19.740]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner
[03:20:19.740 --> 03:20:23.740]  it's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan
[03:20:23.740 --> 03:20:25.740]  the police state isn't coming

[03:21:34.740 --> 03:21:37.740]  on the average Americans work between 45 to 50 years
[03:21:37.740 --> 03:21:39.740]  hoping to build up enough wealth to retire
[03:21:39.740 --> 03:21:41.740]  and live out their golden years
[03:21:41.740 --> 03:21:44.740]  unfortunately with taxation the rising cost of food,
[03:21:44.740 --> 03:21:46.740]  energy, housing and medical
[03:21:46.740 --> 03:21:49.740]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line
[03:21:49.740 --> 03:21:51.740]  is this a flaw free enterprise?
[03:21:51.740 --> 03:21:53.740]  or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note

[03:21:55.740 --> 03:21:57.740]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes
[03:21:57.740 --> 03:21:59.740]  these questions and more can be answered by reading
[03:21:59.740 --> 03:22:02.740]  G. Edward Griffin's book The Creature from Jekyll Island
[03:22:02.740 --> 03:22:04.740]  Congressman Ron Paul states
[03:22:04.740 --> 03:22:06.740]  it's what every American needs to know about

[03:22:33.740 --> 03:22:36.740]  in March Alex Jones announced that E-Foods Direct
[03:22:36.740 --> 03:22:39.740]  was putting together a high volume pre-production order
[03:22:39.740 --> 03:22:41.740]  of the new quick fix meals
[03:22:41.740 --> 03:22:44.740]  by waiting for production and shipping of their orders
[03:22:44.740 --> 03:22:47.740]  families were able to receive one free item
[03:22:47.740 --> 03:22:49.740]  for every three that they bought

[03:22:52.740 --> 03:22:54.740]  we've had a lot of folks calling
[03:22:54.740 --> 03:22:56.740]  disappointed that they missed the order deadline
[03:22:56.740 --> 03:22:57.740]  listen carefully
[03:22:57.740 --> 03:22:58.740]  starting immediately

[03:23:43.740 --> 03:23:47.740]  well we have the PrisonPlanet.com article
[03:23:47.740 --> 03:23:51.740]  Oh, Trial Iteral Commission once war with Iran
[03:23:51.740 --> 03:23:54.740]  we'll get into exactly what this Trial Iteral Commission
[03:23:54.740 --> 03:23:57.740]  top globalists told them
[03:23:57.740 --> 03:24:00.740]  again since we hit that break start over go through who he is
[03:24:00.740 --> 03:24:04.740]  what he said to you what he said about Iran go ahead
[03:24:04.740 --> 03:24:06.740]  Hi Alex we were
[03:24:06.740 --> 03:24:08.740]  we went to the Trial Iteral Commission meeting
[03:24:08.740 --> 03:24:10.740]  it was the very first day of the actual meeting
[03:24:10.740 --> 03:24:12.740]  it was the Friday there wasn't a lot of people there
[03:24:12.740 --> 03:24:15.740]  and the place was locked down pretty tight with security
[03:24:15.740 --> 03:24:17.740]  so we were only outside the ground
[03:24:17.740 --> 03:24:19.740]  they wouldn't let us anywhere near the hotel itself
[03:24:19.740 --> 03:24:22.740]  and there was a couple of people that left
[03:24:22.740 --> 03:24:24.740]  we couldn't really get talking to them
[03:24:24.740 --> 03:24:26.740]  they weren't willing to listen to them that we had to say
[03:24:26.740 --> 03:24:28.740]  but there was this one guy
[03:24:28.740 --> 03:24:30.740]  we saw the Trial Iteral Commission bad
[03:24:30.740 --> 03:24:34.740]  his name was Mikhail Slobodansky I think
[03:24:34.740 --> 03:24:38.740]  he said he was a Russian advisor to former prime ministers
[03:24:38.740 --> 03:24:42.740]  and that the Trial Iteral Commission were deciding the future of the world
[03:24:42.740 --> 03:24:46.740]  he went on to say about
[03:24:46.740 --> 03:24:50.740]  when we mentioned a global currency as an idea
[03:24:50.740 --> 03:24:52.740]  he said that of course that's what they were thinking about
[03:24:52.740 --> 03:24:56.740]  but they'd need a global central bank to implement this
[03:24:56.740 --> 03:24:58.740]  and a global government on top of that
[03:24:58.740 --> 03:25:01.740]  but he said that it was a great idea
[03:25:01.740 --> 03:25:04.740]  and it's what they all wanted and what they were working for
[03:25:04.740 --> 03:25:06.740]  but it's not possible yet
[03:25:06.740 --> 03:25:09.740]  because countries like Iran and South Korea
[03:25:09.740 --> 03:25:12.740]  and these sort of countries they'd never stand up
[03:25:12.740 --> 03:25:15.740]  the same sort of government as America
[03:25:15.740 --> 03:25:18.740]  Incredible, continue
[03:25:18.740 --> 03:25:23.740]  He was more than willing to talk about it for a few minutes
[03:25:23.740 --> 03:25:26.740]  until he got pretty uncomfortable
[03:25:26.740 --> 03:25:28.740]  when we probed him a further question
[03:25:28.740 --> 03:25:31.740]  and he said that the Chad of House Rules
[03:25:31.740 --> 03:25:33.740]  actually prevented him from talking to people
[03:25:33.740 --> 03:25:36.740]  and he might get in trouble for having mentioned what he said to us
[03:25:36.740 --> 03:25:39.740]  he ran off, we tried to get a few more questions from him
[03:25:39.740 --> 03:25:41.740]  but he wasn't willing to talk to us after that
[03:25:41.740 --> 03:25:44.740]  but he'd given us some incredible information
[03:25:44.740 --> 03:25:46.740]  that we didn't think we'd actually get out of any of these guys
[03:25:46.740 --> 03:25:49.740]  he seemed quite naive that he was just willing to talk about it in the open
[03:25:49.740 --> 03:25:51.740]  like I think they think it's a good thing
[03:25:51.740 --> 03:25:55.740]  like these low level guys think they're doing too good for the world
[03:25:55.740 --> 03:25:57.740]  Well they also think we're all blind
[03:25:57.740 --> 03:26:02.740]  they're so used to the public as a blindly walking around drooling
[03:26:02.740 --> 03:26:05.740]  only caring about football or celebrities
[03:26:05.740 --> 03:26:08.740]  that when someone actually, I mean, I've had Rothko
[03:26:08.740 --> 03:26:10.740]  the former head of the Kissinger Group
[03:26:10.740 --> 03:26:13.740]  who wrote the book Super Class and admits world government
[03:26:13.740 --> 03:26:16.740]  and he came right on and said world government's basically good and everything
[03:26:16.740 --> 03:26:21.740]  and it turned out he thought I was Alex S. Jones of the New York Times
[03:26:21.740 --> 03:26:23.740]  who has a radio show on
[03:26:23.740 --> 03:26:26.740]  but we didn't tell him that, that's happened over and over again
[03:26:26.740 --> 03:26:30.740]  that happened with who was the McClatchy
[03:26:30.740 --> 03:26:32.740]  Greg Gordon, the McClatchy newspaper guy
[03:26:32.740 --> 03:26:34.740]  didn't figure it out until he heard my voice
[03:26:34.740 --> 03:26:36.740]  and we don't call him and tell him we're Alex S. Jones
[03:26:36.740 --> 03:26:38.740]  we say infowars.com
[03:26:38.740 --> 03:26:40.740]  I mean these guys are just so used to everybody
[03:26:40.740 --> 03:26:42.740]  and Greg Gordon's a good guy, he said he'd come back on
[03:26:42.740 --> 03:26:45.740]  he thought we were Alex S. Jones too
[03:26:45.740 --> 03:26:48.740]  so does the public, I get accused of being a New York Times writer
[03:26:48.740 --> 03:26:51.740]  who's 69 years old, almost every day
[03:26:51.740 --> 03:26:55.740]  and I get accused of running the Genesis porn website
[03:26:55.740 --> 03:26:57.740]  because I'm on Genesis Network
[03:26:57.740 --> 03:27:00.740]  I mean the public is, again there's no connection folks
[03:27:00.740 --> 03:27:03.740]  I mean the public just is so naive
[03:27:03.740 --> 03:27:06.740]  that I think the globalists just think they've got clean sailing
[03:27:06.740 --> 03:27:08.740]  that's why what you and others are doing
[03:27:08.740 --> 03:27:10.740]  is really starting to shake them up
[03:27:10.740 --> 03:27:13.740]  that more and more of us can see them
[03:27:13.740 --> 03:27:16.740]  Yeah absolutely, it seems that when they take them over here
[03:27:16.740 --> 03:27:20.740]  we end up on the next day, the Saturday, getting a few more snippets out of people
[03:27:20.740 --> 03:27:24.740]  nothing remotely as big but they didn't, none of them seemed to expect it
[03:27:24.740 --> 03:27:27.740]  not even Rockefeller seemed like he was remotely
[03:27:27.740 --> 03:27:29.740]  they didn't expect to see anyone like us over in Ireland
[03:27:29.740 --> 03:27:33.740]  I don't think they realized that there's a revolution happening here
[03:27:33.740 --> 03:27:35.740]  the same as there is everywhere else in the world
[03:27:35.740 --> 03:27:37.740]  people are waking up to what they're doing
[03:27:37.740 --> 03:27:39.740]  they know exactly what they're trying to implement
[03:27:39.740 --> 03:27:41.740]  and we're sick of it
[03:27:41.740 --> 03:27:45.740]  they seem like they just never expect people to be here
[03:27:45.740 --> 03:27:48.740]  and never expect people to contradict what they want
[03:27:48.740 --> 03:27:50.740]  You know what I like about the Irish
[03:27:50.740 --> 03:27:53.740]  in all the videos I've seen and I also hear it from the British
[03:27:53.740 --> 03:27:56.740]  and I've seen it from Americans as well
[03:27:56.740 --> 03:28:01.740]  every We Are Change video I've seen
[03:28:01.740 --> 03:28:06.740]  from Ireland is that it's got that same commanding strength
[03:28:06.740 --> 03:28:08.740]  as when I've confronted globalists
[03:28:08.740 --> 03:28:11.740]  you need to almost psychically reach out and say
[03:28:11.740 --> 03:28:14.740]  I am not your slave and really let them know it
[03:28:14.740 --> 03:28:16.740]  instead of...
[03:28:16.740 --> 03:28:19.740]  some people just kind of namby-pamby doing it
[03:28:19.740 --> 03:28:22.740]  or actually just yelling at them
[03:28:22.740 --> 03:28:26.740]  but it's the way also We Are Change Chicago confronted Gore
[03:28:26.740 --> 03:28:29.740]  we need to just have that authoritative command
[03:28:29.740 --> 03:28:31.740]  and Rockefeller looks scared to death
[03:28:31.740 --> 03:28:33.740]  with the We Are Change people in that video
[03:28:33.740 --> 03:28:35.740]  I mean he turned around and was just disgusted
[03:28:35.740 --> 03:28:38.740]  by the fact that people can see him
[03:28:38.740 --> 03:28:41.740]  Yeah, I don't think he liked it when Rory called him a scumbag
[03:28:41.740 --> 03:28:44.740]  he really heard that, he turned around and gave us that look
[03:28:44.740 --> 03:28:47.740]  like he really didn't expect to see it at all
[03:28:47.740 --> 03:28:49.740]  because at that time most of the...
[03:28:49.740 --> 03:28:52.740]  there was a group gathered outside the hotel for a little while all day
[03:28:52.740 --> 03:28:55.740]  we were there to oversee their arrival
[03:28:55.740 --> 03:28:58.740]  and then we all kind of dissipated after that
[03:28:58.740 --> 03:29:00.740]  and this was a few hours later and there was only a few of us left
[03:29:00.740 --> 03:29:02.740]  just a few of us We Are Change guys
[03:29:02.740 --> 03:29:04.740]  there was myself, Adam, Paul and Rory
[03:29:04.740 --> 03:29:07.740]  we were some of the only ones that were left there
[03:29:07.740 --> 03:29:13.740]  and that was literally five minutes before our president arrived
[03:29:13.740 --> 03:29:17.740]  with an army escort and went into the same building
[03:29:17.740 --> 03:29:19.740]  in the same meeting room as we just caught
[03:29:19.740 --> 03:29:21.740]  David Rockefeller going into
[03:29:21.740 --> 03:29:22.740]  Alan Keenan, stay there
[03:29:22.740 --> 03:29:25.740]  we've got other folks from Ireland coming up with you
[03:29:25.740 --> 03:29:29.740]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run

[03:30:34.820 --> 03:30:40.620]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoodsDirect was putting together a high-volume pre-production
[03:30:40.620 --> 03:30:42.820]  order of the new Quick Fix Meals.
[03:30:42.820 --> 03:30:46.940]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive
[03:30:46.940 --> 03:30:50.300]  one free item for every three that they bought.
[03:30:50.300 --> 03:30:54.300]  Since the final shutdown of this Buy 3 Get 1 Free program, we've had a lot of folks
[03:30:54.300 --> 03:30:57.060]  calling disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[03:30:57.060 --> 03:30:58.420]  Listen carefully.
[03:30:58.420 --> 03:31:03.740]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a Buy 3 Get

[03:31:36.740 --> 03:31:54.140]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing
[03:31:54.140 --> 03:31:55.140]  day.
[03:31:55.140 --> 03:31:57.660]  Think it can't happen here?

[03:32:11.300 --> 03:32:17.060]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:32:17.060 --> 03:32:21.180]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions
[03:32:21.180 --> 03:32:25.580]  about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:32:25.580 --> 03:32:27.940]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:32:27.940 --> 03:32:31.020]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[03:32:31.020 --> 03:32:37.580]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[03:32:37.580 --> 03:32:43.820]  You know, I love seeing new organizations form.
[03:32:43.820 --> 03:32:51.260]  Neil Foster, the person who confronted Rockefeller at his dinner table, he's a friend of Alan
[03:32:51.260 --> 03:32:59.060]  Keenan who's also online with us from We Are Change Ireland, and he is on with us.
[03:32:59.060 --> 03:33:04.580]  He is the co-editor of the Sovereign Independent newspaper, and in a few minutes I want to
[03:33:04.580 --> 03:33:11.180]  play a clip of last year, Luke Radowski, Stewart, and others of We Are Change going to the capital
[03:33:11.180 --> 03:33:16.060]  and going up to Senator Jay Rockefeller and bringing up their family funding, Hitler,
[03:33:16.060 --> 03:33:22.140]  OnRecord, the whole eugenics movement, and Jay Rockefeller, Senator Rockefeller says,
[03:33:22.140 --> 03:33:27.220]  you got a lot of Cajones, boy, and he just looks at me, and these are gangsters, and
[03:33:27.220 --> 03:33:28.220]  they're globalists.
[03:33:28.220 --> 03:33:29.860]  I mean, what, four years ago?
[03:33:29.860 --> 03:33:35.380]  In fact, later, pull me the David Rockefeller quote, just a David Rockefeller quote admitting
[03:33:35.380 --> 03:33:39.500]  global government takeover, and he says, people have accused me of this, and I say guilty
[03:33:39.500 --> 03:33:40.500]  is charged.
[03:33:40.500 --> 03:33:42.340]  I can even give you the page number.
[03:33:42.340 --> 03:33:45.780]  It's 400 and something in his autobiography that he wrote four years ago or five years
[03:33:45.780 --> 03:33:51.460]  ago now, but let's go ahead and get them both up on the line together.
[03:33:51.460 --> 03:33:57.420]  Neil Foster from Dublin, Ireland, and of course, Alan Keenan of We Are Change Ireland will
[03:33:57.420 --> 03:34:03.260]  put both their websites up on screen before they leave us, and of course, both you guys
[03:34:03.260 --> 03:34:04.260]  work together.
[03:34:04.260 --> 03:34:06.100]  Neil Foster, good to have you here with us.
[03:34:06.100 --> 03:34:07.580]  Thanks for having me.
[03:34:07.580 --> 03:34:12.620]  So tell us where you, in and around the trilateral commission meeting, were able to go find David
[03:34:12.620 --> 03:34:19.780]  Rockefeller and, you know, letting know that you were his slave.
[03:34:19.780 --> 03:34:26.020]  Well, myself and actually the editor of the Southern Independent, Mr. Dave Darby, decided
[03:34:26.020 --> 03:34:31.260]  we'd just try and get into the hotel, and we just walked straight in the front door
[03:34:31.260 --> 03:34:37.780]  and passed the security and took a seat in the lobby, and we half an hour later, after
[03:34:37.780 --> 03:34:42.140]  you know, have a cup of coffee, and after a few questions of the way, so David Rockefeller
[03:34:42.140 --> 03:34:46.460]  walks right past us and stands at the table right behind us.
[03:34:46.460 --> 03:34:52.020]  So we just decided we had to confront him when his security guard walked off, we just
[03:34:52.020 --> 03:34:53.020]  took a chance.
[03:34:53.020 --> 03:34:58.020]  Well, you're doing a great job, I've read your newspaper, I mean, it's an actual physical
[03:34:58.020 --> 03:34:59.020]  newspaper and online.
[03:34:59.020 --> 03:35:01.620]  Why don't you give us the website for the sovereign independent?
[03:35:01.620 --> 03:35:02.620]  It's www.SouthernIndependent.ie.
[03:35:02.620 --> 03:35:03.620] .ie for Ireland.
[03:35:03.620 --> 03:35:04.620]  Ireland.
[03:35:04.620 --> 03:35:12.460]  Now, the video is short, it looks like a shot on a cell phone camera, but we can clearly
[03:35:12.460 --> 03:35:13.460] ...
[03:35:13.460 --> 03:35:17.700]  Yeah, well, Dave was very conscious of not having the camera confiscated, so it kind
[03:35:17.700 --> 03:35:20.140]  of held it down to a waist level, and just took two...
[03:35:20.140 --> 03:35:21.140]  Sure.
[03:35:21.140 --> 03:35:25.460]  So describe the full exchange, and what happened, and what he did when you came, and basically
[03:35:25.460 --> 03:35:26.460]  stood beside him.
[03:35:26.460 --> 03:35:31.380]  Well, I tried to put the paper on the table in front of him, but I was very conscious
[03:35:31.380 --> 03:35:35.380]  of not touching him or disturbing any of the glasses and stuff on the table, because it
[03:35:35.380 --> 03:35:39.780]  doesn't want to be, you know, charged with assault on my damaging property or anything,
[03:35:39.780 --> 03:35:45.900]  and Dave, who's the guy with the English accent, was the guy you can hear most on the video,
[03:35:45.900 --> 03:35:50.700]  and we just said to him, we don't want your New York World Order, and we're not your slaves,
[03:35:50.700 --> 03:35:56.660]  and we just walked off and went up to it, but he looked stunned, he looked absolutely
[03:35:56.660 --> 03:36:01.300]  stunned, and I'm sure he was, for a moment, very scared.
[03:36:01.300 --> 03:36:05.740]  Well, yeah, everywhere he goes now, I mean, we get these reports every few weeks, and
[03:36:05.740 --> 03:36:10.580]  videos are posted every month or so, you know, he's in a walk in the park with his bodyguard,
[03:36:10.580 --> 03:36:14.740]  we're not your slaves, we're not your property, we don't want your world government.
[03:36:14.740 --> 03:36:20.380]  Everywhere he goes, he's being confronted, and I want to read the quote here, in David
[03:36:20.380 --> 03:36:24.700]  Rockefeller's book, Memoirs, he admits he is part of a secret cabal working to destroy
[03:36:24.700 --> 03:36:27.740]  the United States and create a New World Order.
[03:36:27.740 --> 03:36:32.980]  Here's a direct quote from the book, page 405, from the paperback.
[03:36:32.980 --> 03:36:37.140]  Some believe we, the Rockefeller family, are part of a secret cabal working against the
[03:36:37.140 --> 03:36:42.540]  best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as internationalist, and of
[03:36:42.540 --> 03:36:45.900]  conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and
[03:36:45.900 --> 03:36:48.460]  economic structure, one world, if you will.
[03:36:48.460 --> 03:36:52.140]  If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.
[03:36:52.140 --> 03:36:55.820]  Here's another quote from the Trilateral Commission in 1991, Evian, France.
[03:36:55.820 --> 03:36:59.340]  We are grateful to Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine, and other great
[03:36:59.340 --> 03:37:03.060]  publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promise of
[03:37:03.060 --> 03:37:05.540]  discretion for almost 40 years.
[03:37:05.540 --> 03:37:08.940]  It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we would have been
[03:37:08.940 --> 03:37:11.620]  subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years.
[03:37:11.620 --> 03:37:16.020]  But the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government.
[03:37:16.020 --> 03:37:21.800]  The supernatural sovereignty of an international intellectual elite and world bankers is surely
[03:37:21.800 --> 03:37:26.620]  preferable to the national auto-determination practice in past centuries.
[03:37:26.620 --> 03:37:33.700]  We actually have that quote in the newspaper, and I believe Bill Clinton was at that meeting.
[03:37:33.700 --> 03:37:34.700]  Absolutely.
[03:37:34.700 --> 03:37:36.860]  And again, he's given countless speeches along these lines.
[03:37:36.860 --> 03:37:42.820]  I want to play the video of We Are Changed screaming at him as he entered the hotel to
[03:37:42.820 --> 03:37:49.820]  meet with your president, here's that video.
[03:37:49.820 --> 03:38:04.340]  Rockefeller, we know what you're doing, we know what you're doing to the world.
[03:38:04.340 --> 03:38:09.220]  Rockefeller, you're a new world order, we'll never come in, you're running out of time.
[03:38:09.220 --> 03:38:13.860]  Come back, you've rushed it, you're screwed up, you're not going to stop, you're Irish
[03:38:13.860 --> 03:38:18.700]  Rockefeller, you're scumbag, we are the Irish, we know what you're up to, you know what you're
[03:38:18.700 --> 03:38:26.220]  up to, Rockefeller, you're not going to talk from me down.
[03:38:26.220 --> 03:38:32.420]  Now let's go back to a year ago, We Are Changed confronting Jay Rockefeller.
[03:38:32.420 --> 03:38:35.700]  This is the senator who says we'd be better off never inventing the internet, trying to
[03:38:35.700 --> 03:38:42.620]  pass legislation to control it, and to restrict it, I mean this guy is pure new world order.
[03:38:42.620 --> 03:38:43.620]  We ready with that clip?
[03:38:43.620 --> 03:38:44.620]  Okay, here it is.
[03:38:44.620 --> 03:38:45.620]  Senator Rockefeller?
[03:38:45.620 --> 03:38:46.620]  Yes.
[03:38:46.620 --> 03:38:51.580]  I'd like to know if you're aware that we, the American people, are aware of the agenda
[03:38:51.580 --> 03:38:55.460]  of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Bilderberg Group, and if you could comment
[03:38:55.460 --> 03:38:58.460]  on that please, because very concerning to a lot of us.
[03:38:58.460 --> 03:39:03.460]  You know, I have 37 people lined up right outside Senator Schumer's office, all of them
[03:39:03.460 --> 03:39:06.020]  wanting to answer precisely that question.
[03:39:06.020 --> 03:39:10.460]  Well, could you just take a brief moment and let us know, because we're not talking about
[03:39:10.460 --> 03:39:11.460]  something we're looking at.
[03:39:11.460 --> 03:39:14.620]  Well, something that's so important, it sort of transcends everything else that we're
[03:39:14.620 --> 03:39:15.620]  talking about, sir.
[03:39:15.620 --> 03:39:16.620]  Can you comment on that please?
[03:39:16.620 --> 03:39:17.620]  No.
[03:39:17.620 --> 03:39:18.620]  I'd like to know about the Bilderberg Group.
[03:39:18.620 --> 03:39:19.620]  I'd like to know about the Bilderberg Group, sir.
[03:39:19.620 --> 03:39:20.620]  Well, that's not part of our discussion.
[03:39:20.620 --> 03:39:21.620]  When can we discuss that with you, sir?
[03:39:21.620 --> 03:39:22.620]  Okay.
[03:39:22.620 --> 03:39:23.620]  Thank you.
[03:39:23.620 --> 03:39:24.620]  Thank you.
[03:39:24.620 --> 03:39:37.140]  Okay, and this is for the Senator, this is the scientific proof of the nanothermarch that's
[03:39:37.140 --> 03:39:42.500]  been found, the scientific proof of World Trade Center's test by scientists from around
[03:39:42.500 --> 03:39:43.500]  the world.
[03:39:43.500 --> 03:39:46.940]  Basically, it puts the proof that there's an article, three sections, three trees in
[03:39:46.940 --> 03:39:49.940]  this cover-up going on, about 9-11, sir, so.
[03:39:49.940 --> 03:39:51.940]  We'd love to get your opinion on that too, sir.
[03:39:51.940 --> 03:39:52.940]  Wait, what did you say?
[03:39:52.940 --> 03:39:53.940]  You're okay.
[03:39:53.940 --> 03:39:54.940]  Thank you.
[03:39:54.940 --> 03:39:55.940]  Okay.
[03:39:55.940 --> 03:39:56.940]  Thank you.
[03:39:56.940 --> 03:39:57.940]  Thank you.
[03:39:57.940 --> 03:40:00.140]  Two families, the Rockefellers and the Oswars.
[03:40:00.140 --> 03:40:05.140]  And then it cuts to a clip about their family, and then it goes into Luke Radowski, really
[03:40:05.140 --> 03:40:06.140]  hitting him hard.
[03:40:06.140 --> 03:40:07.140]  Let's continue rolling this.
[03:40:07.140 --> 03:40:13.900]  Our particularly significant John D. Rockefeller Senior contributed a large amount of money
[03:40:13.900 --> 03:40:18.820]  to build the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in the early 1990s, which housed the Eugenics
[03:40:18.820 --> 03:40:23.180]  Records Office from 1910 to 1944.
[03:40:23.180 --> 03:40:27.220]  The Rockefeller Influence also spread overseas to Germany, where the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute
[03:40:27.220 --> 03:40:32.660]  for Psychiatry and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Eugenics, Anthropology, and Human Heredity
[03:40:32.660 --> 03:40:34.540]  resided.
[03:40:34.540 --> 03:40:39.060]  Much of the money used around these facilities came directly from Rockefeller.
[03:40:39.060 --> 03:40:43.180]  These institutes became centers for Nazi Eugenics programs during the reign of the
[03:40:43.180 --> 03:40:44.180]  Alphabets.
[03:40:44.180 --> 03:40:55.180]  You think your family is starting the modern Eugenics movement, let's call it misprison.
[03:40:55.180 --> 03:40:56.180]  Eugenics that your family has started.
[03:40:56.180 --> 03:40:57.180]  I think it's time for me to really start moving quickly.
[03:40:57.180 --> 03:40:58.180]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:40:58.180 --> 03:40:59.180]  You could just address some of these things if you want.
[03:40:59.180 --> 03:41:00.180]  No, no, go find somebody else to talk to.
[03:41:00.180 --> 03:41:01.180]  Thank you.
[03:41:01.180 --> 03:41:02.180]  Well, your family did start the modern Eugenics movement.
[03:41:02.180 --> 03:41:03.180]  That Hitler is living up to it.
[03:41:03.180 --> 03:41:04.180]  Of course.
[03:41:04.180 --> 03:41:05.180]  And you don't want to talk about the billboard.
[03:41:05.180 --> 03:41:15.180]  Well, what about the billboard?
[03:41:15.180 --> 03:41:16.180]  They certainly do.
[03:41:16.180 --> 03:41:21.180]  They want to get through to the Eugenics as well.
[03:41:21.180 --> 03:41:27.180]  The truth is coming out and there's a lot of us that are aware of it.
[03:41:27.180 --> 03:41:30.180]  I'm sure you know some members, sir, if you're not a member yourself.
[03:41:30.180 --> 03:41:37.180]  President Obama's director of national intelligence, Admiral Blair, who I greatly respect, have labeled
[03:41:37.180 --> 03:41:50.180]  cybersecurity perpetrated through the Internet as the number one national hazard of attack
[03:41:50.180 --> 03:41:55.180]  on the homeland in West Virginia, in West Virginia, in America, anywhere else.
[03:41:55.180 --> 03:42:00.180]  So, I mean, it really almost makes you ask the question, would it have been better if
[03:42:00.180 --> 03:42:02.180]  we never invented the Internet?
[03:42:02.180 --> 03:42:04.180]  There you go.
[03:42:04.180 --> 03:42:08.180]  So that was interspersed with documentaries and him being confronted.
[03:42:08.180 --> 03:42:10.180]  And he tells, Luke, you ought to run for Congress.
[03:42:10.180 --> 03:42:11.180]  You got a lot of guts.
[03:42:11.180 --> 03:42:13.180]  You use another word.
[03:42:13.180 --> 03:42:14.180]  But here it is.
[03:42:14.180 --> 03:42:16.180]  Israel primed for war on Iran.
[03:42:16.180 --> 03:42:17.180]  That's Reuters.
[03:42:17.180 --> 03:42:18.180]  So they're openly getting ready for it.
[03:42:18.180 --> 03:42:23.180]  And here you talk to one of the Russian advisors who was at the trilateral commission meeting,
[03:42:23.180 --> 03:42:26.180]  Alan Akien, with We Are Change Ireland.
[03:42:26.180 --> 03:42:28.180]  And he goes, yeah, we got to get rid of Iran.
[03:42:28.180 --> 03:42:29.180]  We got to go up against him.
[03:42:29.180 --> 03:42:30.180]  We got to have a world government.
[03:42:30.180 --> 03:42:33.180]  I mean, they got to mop up any sovereign country that's left.
[03:42:33.180 --> 03:42:35.180]  And I'm not saying Iran's good, folks.
[03:42:35.180 --> 03:42:38.180]  The point is, the globalists are a lot worse.
[03:42:38.180 --> 03:42:44.180]  Other points you guys want to make about what's happening or what you guys did in concert together
[03:42:44.180 --> 03:42:46.180]  to expose the trilateral commission in Dublin.
[03:42:46.180 --> 03:42:50.180]  Notice they were meeting right before the implosion of the euro.
[03:42:50.180 --> 03:42:55.180]  Well, Peter Sutherland was also there.
[03:42:55.180 --> 03:42:59.180]  And he went on TV and radio the day after.
[03:42:59.180 --> 03:43:03.180]  And said that Ireland had to implement more austerity measures.
[03:43:03.180 --> 03:43:05.180]  So he obviously got his orders.
[03:43:05.180 --> 03:43:08.180]  And for those that don't know who Sutherland is, tell them.
[03:43:08.180 --> 03:43:10.180]  Well, he does.
[03:43:10.180 --> 03:43:13.180]  He's an ex-government tax head.
[03:43:13.180 --> 03:43:14.180]  Yeah.
[03:43:14.180 --> 03:43:18.180]  And then he goes on your news and tells you, you've got to give us all your money.
[03:43:18.180 --> 03:43:19.180]  Yeah.
[03:43:19.180 --> 03:43:24.180]  And then, of course, Gordon Brown resigned as he's been told to do.
[03:43:24.180 --> 03:43:29.180]  And we have another puppet government in Britain.
[03:43:29.180 --> 03:43:32.180]  By the way, we ought to queue up that love police video.
[03:43:32.180 --> 03:43:40.180]  That's another kind of We Are Change group where they're screaming and yelling at...
[03:43:40.180 --> 03:43:41.180]  And we can play it.
[03:43:41.180 --> 03:43:42.180]  He doesn't cuss.
[03:43:42.180 --> 03:43:43.180]  Yeah.
[03:43:43.180 --> 03:43:44.180]  Yeah.
[03:43:44.180 --> 03:43:45.180]  Tell folks about the love police.
[03:43:45.180 --> 03:43:49.180]  Well, I actually met Charlie last year in Bristol.
[03:43:49.180 --> 03:43:56.180]  They simply go out in a very peaceful and amicable way with their cameras going on.
[03:43:56.180 --> 03:43:59.180]  And they just challenge these people wherever they find them.
[03:43:59.180 --> 03:44:03.180]  And that's what we all need to do.
[03:44:03.180 --> 03:44:07.180]  We all need to challenge these people because they're not immune from us.
[03:44:07.180 --> 03:44:08.180]  Yeah.
[03:44:08.180 --> 03:44:09.180]  The new Pitchfork...
[03:44:09.180 --> 03:44:10.180]  And there's two of them.
[03:44:10.180 --> 03:44:12.180]  And we should be at them every opportunity.
[03:44:12.180 --> 03:44:16.180]  The new Pitchfork is a video camera because then other people see the globalist being
[03:44:16.180 --> 03:44:17.180]  confronted.
[03:44:17.180 --> 03:44:21.180]  And the public begins to realize that both political parties, no matter what major
[03:44:21.180 --> 03:44:25.180]  country it is or control, and that's how the ruling class that's totally corrupt and
[03:44:25.180 --> 03:44:27.180]  anti-freedom stays in power.
[03:44:27.180 --> 03:44:30.180]  Any other comments from you, Alan Kean?
[03:44:30.180 --> 03:44:35.180]  We're regarded for the video you were saying about Charlie Beach over in London.
[03:44:35.180 --> 03:44:37.180]  They tried to hide that one.
[03:44:37.180 --> 03:44:38.180]  That was broadcast live.
[03:44:38.180 --> 03:44:42.180]  And then Charlie approached him, he went right up to right beside the BBC cameras.
[03:44:42.180 --> 03:44:44.180]  And he was shouting at these guys.
[03:44:44.180 --> 03:44:47.180]  And he said it was an awful lot of stuff that they wouldn't want to get out.
[03:44:47.180 --> 03:44:51.180]  And the whole audio that was going out live started to break up within a moment
[03:44:51.180 --> 03:44:52.180]  they started talking.
[03:44:52.180 --> 03:44:56.180]  And then they voiced over it with a BBC broadcaster.
[03:44:56.180 --> 03:44:59.180]  So you couldn't hear anything that Charlie and the local police were actually saying
[03:44:59.180 --> 03:45:03.180]  to the politician.
[03:45:03.180 --> 03:45:05.180]  Yeah, there they are at a press conference.
[03:45:05.180 --> 03:45:08.180]  It's going out over air, but magically the feed breaks up.
[03:45:08.180 --> 03:45:10.180]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:45:10.180 --> 03:45:14.180]  Yeah, it's not surprising really considering the media blackout on everything over here.
[03:45:14.180 --> 03:45:16.180]  Like it's the exact same.
[03:45:16.180 --> 03:45:21.180]  I mean, when we approached the trial out of commission, there was actually a media
[03:45:21.180 --> 03:45:23.180]  invite sent around to some of the Irish media.
[03:45:23.180 --> 03:45:26.180]  And I mean, the Irish media over here, they were whitewashed.
[03:45:26.180 --> 03:45:30.180]  And there was a couple of them that went in and they were told that they could only
[03:45:30.180 --> 03:45:35.180]  stay for an hour for the Prime Minister's speech and then that they had to leave.
[03:45:35.180 --> 03:45:38.180]  And we approached these guys when they were leaving going, did you get any information
[03:45:38.180 --> 03:45:41.180]  who the trial out of commission are or what what they're doing today?
[03:45:41.180 --> 03:45:46.180]  Or if they've or if they've any other agenda and why they're kicking you out,
[03:45:46.180 --> 03:45:47.180]  why it's private meeting?
[03:45:47.180 --> 03:45:49.180]  And the guys, they're not real journalists at all.
[03:45:49.180 --> 03:45:51.180]  They're just too afraid to go and do anything.
[03:45:51.180 --> 03:45:54.180]  So we had to go and do the groundwork firm.
[03:45:54.180 --> 03:45:56.180]  We got the video and the audio stuff on our site.
[03:45:56.180 --> 03:46:00.180]  We are change.ie and also on Fremont Ireland.
[03:46:00.180 --> 03:46:03.180]  And that's going viral on the internet now.
[03:46:03.180 --> 03:46:06.180]  And it shows where the new media is actually coming from.
[03:46:06.180 --> 03:46:08.180]  Well, that's why they want to shut the internet down.
[03:46:08.180 --> 03:46:10.180]  And I've never seen the love police get angry.
[03:46:10.180 --> 03:46:12.180]  They always are super nice.
[03:46:12.180 --> 03:46:15.180]  But the globalists clearly know that he's Scottish.
[03:46:15.180 --> 03:46:19.180]  But they say, get out of here, American as a mind control op.
[03:46:19.180 --> 03:46:21.180]  And he does get a little angry with them.
[03:46:21.180 --> 03:46:24.180]  But we're going to go ahead and play that video and audio as the globalists are
[03:46:24.180 --> 03:46:26.180]  confronted everywhere.
[03:46:26.180 --> 03:46:31.180]  And as the new leaders of the British government meet the new boss,
[03:46:31.180 --> 03:46:33.180]  same as the old boss, fooled again,
[03:46:33.180 --> 03:46:35.180]  are confronted on how the whole system's fake.
[03:46:35.180 --> 03:46:36.180]  Here it is.
[03:46:36.180 --> 03:46:38.180]  George Osborne, Bullingdon Club, William Hague.
[03:46:38.180 --> 03:46:39.180]  Hello, the elites.
[03:46:39.180 --> 03:46:41.180]  How are these Zionist elites this morning?
[03:46:41.180 --> 03:46:44.180]  Thank you for giving us the illusion of democracy.
[03:46:44.180 --> 03:46:47.180]  Do you want the puppet on the left or the puppet on the right?
[03:46:47.180 --> 03:46:50.180]  Yes, you guys go slightly crazy when you compromise
[03:46:50.180 --> 03:46:52.180]  personal morality for political gain.
[03:46:52.180 --> 03:46:55.180]  Hey, how is your time on the Rothschild Jot?
[03:46:55.180 --> 03:46:58.180]  Do you like the Rothschilds more than you like normal people?
[03:46:58.180 --> 03:47:02.180]  George Osborne, isn't it great that you have a country of 70 million people
[03:47:02.180 --> 03:47:04.180]  where 7% control all the land?
[03:47:04.180 --> 03:47:06.180]  Are you related to the Queen, sir?
[03:47:06.180 --> 03:47:08.180]  Go home, Yang.
[03:47:08.180 --> 03:47:09.180]  Go home, Yang.
[03:47:09.180 --> 03:47:11.180]  Oh, some random racism by this gentleman here.
[03:47:11.180 --> 03:47:13.180]  Perhaps you'd like to vote for the BNP.
[03:47:13.180 --> 03:47:15.180]  Yes, yes.
[03:47:15.180 --> 03:47:17.180]  William Hague, George Osborne.
[03:47:17.180 --> 03:47:21.180]  Hey, it must be difficult for lateing Satan all day.
[03:47:21.180 --> 03:47:25.180]  Hey, power and money from the nice teat of Satan.
[03:47:25.180 --> 03:47:29.180]  Sorry, I'm not even religious, but you guys are liars and murderers.
[03:47:29.180 --> 03:47:31.180]  Total liars and murderers.
[03:47:31.180 --> 03:47:35.180]  You should talk about America.
[03:47:35.180 --> 03:47:40.180]  I'm not even American, my friend. I'm Scottish, so F-U.
[03:47:40.180 --> 03:47:43.180]  Even worse, get out of the room.
[03:47:43.180 --> 03:47:46.180]  Perhaps you'd prefer if we joined the European Union,
[03:47:46.180 --> 03:47:48.180]  you little shill idiot.
[03:47:48.180 --> 03:47:53.180]  I'm the English people's scumbag.
[03:47:53.180 --> 03:47:55.180]  Yeah, liars. Hello, liars.
[03:47:55.180 --> 03:47:58.180]  Hey, big power and money. Politics, yeah.
[03:47:58.180 --> 03:48:01.180]  Illusion of democracy. Scumbags.
[03:48:01.180 --> 03:48:04.180]  Nothing personal. You guys look great on TV.
[03:48:04.180 --> 03:48:07.180]  Sorry for ruining your presence.
[03:48:07.180 --> 03:48:11.180]  And it goes on and on. The point is that they had their handlers in the crowd.
[03:48:11.180 --> 03:48:14.180]  You've got the Prime Minister, the new Prime Minister of England, Cameron, up there.
[03:48:14.180 --> 03:48:19.180]  He comes in to the press conference and they just cut the audio feed on the news
[03:48:19.180 --> 03:48:23.180]  and then they end the press conference. Absolutely incredible.
[03:48:23.180 --> 03:48:28.180]  I tell you, if this is catching on and this is scaring the system, isn't it, guys?
[03:48:28.180 --> 03:48:30.180]  Absolutely.
[03:48:30.180 --> 03:48:35.180]  I just wanted to add, there was a German delegate came out early in the day
[03:48:35.180 --> 03:48:39.180]  and we had a blackout there with Rockefeller on it.
[03:48:39.180 --> 03:48:44.180]  He was saying that he was wanted for crimes against humanity and this German delegate
[03:48:44.180 --> 03:48:47.180]  was trying to justify everything that Rockefeller had done,
[03:48:47.180 --> 03:48:51.180]  despite everybody around him giving evidence to the country
[03:48:51.180 --> 03:48:54.180]  and he ended up just walking away.
[03:48:54.180 --> 03:48:58.180]  So a German delegate came up to you and was trying to defend...
[03:48:58.180 --> 03:49:00.180]  David Rockefeller, yeah.
[03:49:00.180 --> 03:49:05.180]  He was a journalist but he told somebody else later that he was an industrialist
[03:49:05.180 --> 03:49:08.180]  so he couldn't keep his story straight for five minutes.
[03:49:08.180 --> 03:49:12.180]  I mean, the Rockefellers on record funded the eugenics movement, funded Hitler,
[03:49:12.180 --> 03:49:16.180]  funded Planned Parenthood, their total world government people.
[03:49:16.180 --> 03:49:21.180]  David Rockefeller founded all the major UN groups, their family gave the UN the land.
[03:49:21.180 --> 03:49:26.180]  I mean, this is the global empire and... Absolutely, absolutely.
[03:49:26.180 --> 03:49:30.180]  But we have these people coming out trying to justify it all.
[03:49:30.180 --> 03:49:34.180]  You know, it's laughable.
[03:49:34.180 --> 03:49:38.180]  Well, more people need to join and support the Sovereign Independent newspaper
[03:49:38.180 --> 03:49:40.180]  and to join We Are Changed Ireland.
[03:49:40.180 --> 03:49:42.180]  Give us both the websites one more time, men.
[03:49:42.180 --> 03:49:46.180]  www.sovereignindependence.ie
[03:49:46.180 --> 03:49:48.180]  That's how I can tell you this.
[03:49:48.180 --> 03:49:51.180]  Yeah, we're on WeAreChanged.ie
[03:49:51.180 --> 03:49:55.180]  and there's also an awful lot of us on the Free Man Ireland website.
[03:49:55.180 --> 03:49:57.180]  It's freemanireland.ning.com.
[03:49:57.180 --> 03:50:00.180]  We're doing an awful lot of meetups on there
[03:50:00.180 --> 03:50:03.180]  and we talk about exactly what's going on in the country, you know?
[03:50:03.180 --> 03:50:07.180]  Well, freedom's really starting to catch on worldwide, isn't it?
[03:50:07.180 --> 03:50:09.180]  Yeah, it's really taking off.
[03:50:09.180 --> 03:50:13.180]  We're making some more visits to you.
[03:50:13.180 --> 03:50:16.180]  Absolutely, guys. Let's talk a little bit more on the other side.
[03:50:16.180 --> 03:50:18.180]  We've only got a few minutes left with both of you.
[03:50:18.180 --> 03:50:21.180]  You know, no matter what they do to me
[03:50:21.180 --> 03:50:25.180]  or one of these guys individually, they can't stop the idea.
[03:50:25.180 --> 03:50:27.180]  Like they say in V for Vendetta.
[03:50:27.180 --> 03:50:32.180]  I am but flesh and blood, but ideas, ideas are bulletproof.
[03:50:32.180 --> 03:50:34.180]  We'll be right back.
[03:50:37.180 --> 03:50:40.180]  If you owe the IRS money you can't pay, then listen carefully
[03:50:40.180 --> 03:50:43.180]  because you already know that the problem won't go away by itself.

[03:53:32.180 --> 03:53:35.180]  Freeze dry guy, the best you can buy.
[03:53:35.180 --> 03:54:04.180]  20 plus thousand people in the last two years have died on the border and in Mexico.
[03:54:04.180 --> 03:54:11.180]  Mexico is completely collapsing and I just had it here in my stack.
[03:54:11.180 --> 03:54:12.180]  The guys gave it to me.
[03:54:12.180 --> 03:54:20.180]  Mainstream news out of south Texas with border battles, with cartels, with US forces and Mexican forces battling them.
[03:54:20.180 --> 03:54:21.180]  Guys, reprint me.
[03:54:21.180 --> 03:54:23.180]  That's what I'm going to have it at the very end.
[03:54:23.180 --> 03:54:24.180]  Thank you.
[03:54:24.180 --> 03:54:27.180]  I know you gave it to me, but it's just a complete mess in here.
[03:54:27.180 --> 03:54:32.180]  I'll be back Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m. central standard time of the abbreviated Sunday broadcast.
[03:54:32.180 --> 03:54:34.180]  I'll be back Monday live at 11 a.m. central.
[03:54:34.180 --> 03:54:43.180]  Going back to Alan Kean, real fast, any other closing comments from the front lines there in Ireland?
[03:54:43.180 --> 03:54:50.180]  I'm not sure if you saw the story, but there were a couple of guys who were there with us, Mark and a couple others,
[03:54:50.180 --> 03:54:59.180]  that actually served the Irish police with an arrest warrant for Henry Kissinger that was actually given out by a Spanish judge.
[03:54:59.180 --> 03:55:05.180]  They said they'd try and process that, but it'd be difficult because it was the weekend.
[03:55:05.180 --> 03:55:12.180]  Now we've looked into it and the actual Spanish judge who served the arrest warrant on Henry Kissinger for war crimes,
[03:55:12.180 --> 03:55:19.180]  he's now been forced to step down for, I mean, the reasons they gave are probably different than what they are,
[03:55:19.180 --> 03:55:23.180]  but this wouldn't remotely go through over here.
[03:55:23.180 --> 03:55:26.180]  We tried to get it processed by the police over here.
[03:55:26.180 --> 03:55:32.180]  They seemed to listen and they said they'd forward it on while Henry Kissinger was in the country,
[03:55:32.180 --> 03:55:39.180]  but then they said they were going to have to wait until Monday at the very earliest when Kissinger was already on a plane home.
[03:55:39.180 --> 03:55:41.180]  Alright, well good talking to you.
[03:55:41.180 --> 03:55:43.180]  I appreciate you being on with us.
[03:55:43.180 --> 03:55:44.180]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[03:55:44.180 --> 03:55:49.180]  Closing comments from Neil Foster with the sovereign independent newspaper who's confronting these people.
[03:55:49.180 --> 03:55:57.180]  I would just like to encourage everybody out there, if you see these people in the street or if they send me things, go around there and tell them what you think of them,
[03:55:57.180 --> 03:56:05.180]  because these people think they're totally immune from the public and totally cut off from the public and if the public get in the face,
[03:56:05.180 --> 03:56:10.180]  then that's all we can do and let them know that we know what they're doing.
[03:56:10.180 --> 03:56:12.180]  Absolutely, good to talk to you.
[03:56:12.180 --> 03:56:18.180]  I appreciate you coming on the show and I'm buoyed by the work you guys are doing.
[03:56:18.180 --> 03:56:25.180]  It just encourages everyone and it's good to be working with people all over the world against the New World Order.
[03:56:25.180 --> 03:56:26.180]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[03:56:26.180 --> 03:56:27.180]  Thanks a lot.
[03:56:27.180 --> 03:56:28.180]  Alright, Alex.
[03:56:28.180 --> 03:56:29.180]  You bet.
[03:56:29.180 --> 03:56:35.180]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen, and my guys do a great job of giving me news, but I mixed it up here in my stack.
[03:56:35.180 --> 03:56:39.180]  I've got a particular report here out of Channel 5 television.
[03:56:39.180 --> 03:56:52.180]  Zeta is preparing for assault on Rianosa and this is out of KR, GV, TV, and more and more, the cartels are attacking police.
[03:56:52.180 --> 03:56:53.180]  They're attacking citizens.
[03:56:53.180 --> 03:56:54.180]  They're killing people.
[03:56:54.180 --> 03:56:55.180]  What did you just tell me?
[03:56:55.180 --> 03:56:58.180]  Just roll the video in the background.
[03:56:58.180 --> 03:57:00.180]  We won't have time to play the audio.
[03:57:00.180 --> 03:57:03.180]  And it says Zeta is preparing for assault on Rianosa.
[03:57:03.180 --> 03:57:10.180]  This is amazing, Channel 5 news, KR, GV.
[03:57:10.180 --> 03:57:12.180]  I mean, this is what's going on.
[03:57:12.180 --> 03:57:16.180]  And then they put movies out coming out in September like Machete glorifying these people.
[03:57:16.180 --> 03:57:18.180]  I mean, this is just insane.
[03:57:18.180 --> 03:57:23.180]  And it says, Trusted Channel 5 news source confirms a potentially dangerous situation is unfolding along the border.
[03:57:23.180 --> 03:57:27.180]  According to multiple law enforcement agencies, the Zeta is one of the most dangerous drug gangs.
[03:57:27.180 --> 03:57:33.180]  Preparing for an assault on the Rianosa area, the battle is supposed to begin this weekend as they kill police and military.
[03:57:33.180 --> 03:57:35.180]  We're told will likely last longer.
[03:57:35.180 --> 03:57:41.180]  Channel 5 news, contacts, DPS, other law enforcement agencies have confirmed this information is legitimate and very real.
[03:57:41.180 --> 03:57:43.180]  So, I mean, we'll cover it Sunday.
[03:57:43.180 --> 03:57:46.180]  We'll know more about it then and something big breaks out.
[03:57:46.180 --> 03:57:51.180]  I'll do an emergency live transmission internet only at infowars.com and at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:57:51.180 --> 03:57:56.180]  Now you know why I'm so concerned about films like Machete where it glorifies the drug dealers.
[03:57:56.180 --> 03:57:58.180]  We're going to kill the evil Whitey.
[03:57:58.180 --> 03:58:03.180]  I mean, it's just, we need to all come together against tyranny, against racism by any group.
[03:58:03.180 --> 03:58:04.180]  Great job with the crew.
[03:58:04.180 --> 03:58:06.180]  Another incredibly powerful radio transmission.
[03:58:06.180 --> 03:58:09.180]  I had a death row inmate on who talked to him at the McVeigh.
[03:58:09.180 --> 03:58:11.180]  That came on in the second hour.
[03:58:11.180 --> 03:58:12.180]  God bless you all.
[03:58:12.180 --> 03:58:13.180]  Retreat Mission starts now.
