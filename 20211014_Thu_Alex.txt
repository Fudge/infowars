[00:00.000 --> 00:10.240]  It's Thursday, October 14th, 2021.
[00:10.240 --> 00:14.880]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, I'll be co-hosting today with Owen Schreuer, who's in studio
[00:14.880 --> 00:21.600]  in Austin, Texas, and I'll be back tomorrow in studio in Austin, Texas.
[00:21.600 --> 00:25.360]  There's obviously a lot of incredibly important news to cover, a lot of important news and
[00:25.360 --> 00:29.080]  information to establish, but either doesn't want you to know or information they want
[00:29.080 --> 00:35.040]  to put out first with their spin and their deception added to it.
[00:35.040 --> 00:40.240]  But I think before I get into all of these really earth-shaking events that have been
[00:40.240 --> 00:48.120]  unfolding like the British government's own vaccine surveillance system coming out two
[00:48.120 --> 00:53.560]  days ago, we reported on it yesterday, and confirming that the vast majority of people
[00:53.560 --> 01:00.480]  that are hospitalized and who were dying have been, quote, vaccinated against COVID-19,
[01:00.480 --> 01:06.920]  and that you are, quote, twice as likely to contract COVID-19 if you've had the vaccine.
[01:06.920 --> 01:12.640]  As our top experts said over a year and a half ago in the year, countless epidemiologists,
[01:12.640 --> 01:18.320]  virologists, scientists, medical doctors, that once a large portion of the public took
[01:18.320 --> 01:23.440]  the shot, the establishment within claim, the social engineers within claim, that it
[01:23.440 --> 01:26.240]  was the unvaccinated making the vaccinated sick.
[01:26.240 --> 01:31.360]  Now, you had to murder logic on many fronts there and say, well, wait, I thought you're
[01:31.360 --> 01:33.080]  protected because you had the vaccine.
[01:33.080 --> 01:35.480]  So they said, well, you just won't get as sick.
[01:35.480 --> 01:39.880]  And now they say, well, you do get more sick, but you need a booster and it'll protect
[01:39.880 --> 01:44.520]  you even though the Israeli studies say it does nothing except make you sicker.
[01:44.520 --> 01:48.640]  But what did all the experts say, they said injecting somebody with a spike protein and
[01:48.640 --> 01:54.760]  programming the body to produce said spike protein that makes you sick will actually
[01:54.760 --> 02:00.520]  cause you to test positive for COVID and have COVID-like symptoms, but at a greater level.
[02:00.520 --> 02:04.760]  Now it doesn't take an epidemiologist or virologist or top scientist or pathologist
[02:04.760 --> 02:08.720]  to tell you that, but that's who's said that.
[02:08.720 --> 02:14.280]  You know, four months ago, the head German pathology association.
[02:14.280 --> 02:20.480]  You know, the coroners, they came out and said they're seeing a more than doubling of
[02:20.480 --> 02:24.560]  all different types of cancers and a blood clot and heart attacks.
[02:24.560 --> 02:30.200]  Overall, they said a doubling in the number of people that they would see dying from those
[02:30.200 --> 02:31.200]  things.
[02:31.200 --> 02:32.200]  You can look that up.
[02:32.200 --> 02:36.840]  Oh, but don't worry, Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and Google and all the rest of
[02:36.840 --> 02:41.400]  it censor that when it comes out and there's articles will cover coming up where more top
[02:41.400 --> 02:47.520]  scientists have gone public, but also bioethics individuals have gone public heads of universities
[02:47.520 --> 02:49.640]  of their bioethics departments have gone public.
[02:49.640 --> 02:53.400]  Now it's 12 I count the U.S. alone and you know what happens to them.
[02:53.400 --> 02:57.800]  They're either fired or put on administrative leave because this is all an exercise in gas
[02:57.800 --> 03:02.920]  lighting in getting people to rationalize and make excuses for what's happening and
[03:02.920 --> 03:04.880]  just accept being soft killed.
[03:04.880 --> 03:09.520]  I've always told you they would hit you with a weak virus and then they would start putting
[03:09.520 --> 03:14.600]  out stronger viruses and then it would also claim that the vaccine you were taking was
[03:14.600 --> 03:18.440]  protecting you and that other people who weren't vaccinated were hurting you.
[03:18.440 --> 03:24.720]  And again, we've been on these lines over and over again, but now we're living.
[03:24.720 --> 03:26.480]  Now we're right in the middle of it.
[03:26.480 --> 03:32.160]  And there's that John Hopkins data put out last week from over a hundred countries with
[03:32.160 --> 03:36.520]  the same numbers, massively more likely to get sick, massively more likely to be in the
[03:36.520 --> 03:40.000]  hospital, massively more likely to die.
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.760]  And now the British government's own analysis comes out and we had the article yesterday
[03:46.760 --> 03:51.560]  with a link directly to the British government's own data site and I saw commenters on Bandai
[03:51.560 --> 03:53.360]  video saying, where's the proof?
[03:53.360 --> 03:54.360]  I don't see it.
[03:54.360 --> 03:56.400]  Folks, those aren't regular commenters.
[03:56.400 --> 04:00.600]  Those are people coming in hoping you don't go read the documents and hoping you just
[04:00.600 --> 04:06.480]  think that the information isn't there because that's the only hope they've got now is telling
[04:06.480 --> 04:10.360]  you that nothing bad is happening, telling you nothing's going on, so you just go back
[04:10.360 --> 04:13.520]  to sleep so they can quietly kill you.
[04:13.520 --> 04:18.240]  It's just unbelievable to be at this level of society and civilization.
[04:18.240 --> 04:20.600]  Again, I'm going to say it.
[04:20.600 --> 04:24.760]  We are in a trance, humanity must awaken from the trance, we must get out of the trance
[04:24.760 --> 04:26.560]  and we have any future.
[04:26.560 --> 04:31.400]  And we must go to the John Hopkins zone data and we must go to the British government's
[04:31.400 --> 04:38.600]  own data and we must see it there for ourselves, twice as likely to get sick, more likely to
[04:38.600 --> 04:44.160]  be hospitalized and die and it's the same numbers from around the world.
[04:44.160 --> 04:48.000]  I'm going to have both articles on the British Medical Journal, on the British Medical Reports,
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.360]  the British Medical Tracking System and John Hopkins today.
[04:53.360 --> 04:54.360]  We'll be right back today with us.
[04:54.360 --> 04:55.360]  I'm Alex Jones.
[04:55.360 --> 05:02.360]  This is the M4War at m4wars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[05:02.360 --> 05:06.720]  I want to be very clear, the fact that M4Wars is having trouble funding itself is not the
[05:06.720 --> 05:12.440]  fault of our amazing listeners and supporters, it is the fault of the globalists.
[05:12.440 --> 05:15.840]  When we can get enough of our great supplements from the products in, we're able to sell
[05:15.840 --> 05:20.600]  enough of it to stay on air and quite frankly even expand in the face of the world war.
[05:20.600 --> 05:24.200]  But because of the supply chain breakdowns that were very easy to predict from the global
[05:24.200 --> 05:28.680]  lockdowns that were designed to do that, we have had real problems getting our best selling
[05:28.680 --> 05:29.680]  products in.
[05:29.680 --> 05:33.560]  Some of them take up to 10 months to get in, we've had to discontinue some of our products
[05:33.560 --> 05:36.760]  because we just can't get the ingredients anymore.
[05:36.760 --> 05:41.800]  It's pretty scary stuff, so please take advantage of sales we're running for one week only.
[05:41.800 --> 05:47.520]  There's only one week left from October 11th for seven days, kicks off October 11th on
[05:47.520 --> 05:53.960]  things like DNA Force Plus at 40% off, Winter Sun at 50% off, Ultra 12 at 50% off and more
[05:53.960 --> 05:56.160]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[05:56.160 --> 06:12.760]  One week left, check out these incredible deals.
[06:12.760 --> 06:17.640]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[06:17.640 --> 06:19.360]  You want to stop tyranny?
[06:19.360 --> 06:20.920]  Well so does he.
[06:20.920 --> 06:27.160]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:27.160 --> 06:40.200]  If you had to have one unifying statement to describe what the globalists are building,
[06:40.200 --> 06:48.440]  what their worldview is, what their goal is, it's anti-human, it's post-human.
[06:48.440 --> 06:53.240]  It hates the very nature of what makes us strong, what makes us happy, what makes us
[06:53.240 --> 06:57.600]  healthy, what makes us thrive.
[06:57.600 --> 06:59.760]  But it's not just fundamentally anti-human.
[06:59.760 --> 07:07.800]  Oh, this system tells us in so many messages, in so many ways, every day that it's the
[07:07.800 --> 07:13.280]  guardian of the earth, that it loves the planet, that it's going to save the whales and the
[07:13.280 --> 07:15.840]  birds and the bees.
[07:15.840 --> 07:22.960]  So when you pull back into the actual writings of the futurists, of the high priests of this
[07:22.960 --> 07:30.560]  system, they tell you we are going to become gods and this earth is nothing to us and we
[07:30.560 --> 07:37.280]  would destroy the whole universe if that's what it took for us to ascend to godhood.
[07:37.280 --> 07:38.280]  It's in my full min-game.
[07:38.280 --> 07:42.800]  The quotes by the individuals who are the high priests of the system, remember four
[07:42.800 --> 07:51.920]  years ago, Elon Musk famously said, beware those who talk of AI gods and beware of those
[07:51.920 --> 07:58.440]  who worship AI gods because they worship themselves.
[07:58.440 --> 08:05.920]  And they see humanity's destruction as the toll to the boatman Charon to take them into
[08:05.920 --> 08:09.160]  their Valhalla or their heaven, which is our hell.
[08:09.160 --> 08:19.520]  Now, I've got a lot of really important news to cover on this Thursday, October 14th transmission.
[08:19.520 --> 08:25.600]  But before I lay out the latest earth shaking developments, I want to talk about the big
[08:25.600 --> 08:30.680]  picture of the 35,000 foot view.
[08:30.680 --> 08:37.400]  Because if you're going to describe the system we're facing, this has to burn into your
[08:37.400 --> 08:44.360]  psyche and really etch itself into your awareness and your consciousness, not just if you want
[08:44.360 --> 08:49.960]  to be free, not just if you want to survive a couple of years, not just if you want to
[08:49.960 --> 08:54.800]  have any future, but if you don't want your very will, your very essence, your very soul
[08:54.800 --> 08:59.760]  that is quite real, absorbed and overwritten by this.
[08:59.760 --> 09:08.960]  We're talking about your eternal wish, your eternal choice that all of us are making right
[09:08.960 --> 09:17.960]  now and as the evil, as the anti-life system pushes out and dominates and manifests itself
[09:17.960 --> 09:22.440]  in its attack, in its ravenous hunger.
[09:22.440 --> 09:28.640]  So here is the big statement and I want to sink in and I want you to ponder it at a
[09:28.640 --> 09:35.040]  cellular level and at a spiritual gut level, deep down you know it's true.
[09:35.040 --> 09:39.600]  What we face, if you had to describe it as one word, I said I'd describe it as one word
[09:39.600 --> 09:43.080]  but I didn't because I haven't described it yet.
[09:43.080 --> 09:54.480]  The one word is alien, alien, not of this world.
[09:54.480 --> 09:59.440]  Just as all the ancient texts and hieroglyphs tell us, just as the Bible tells us, just
[09:59.440 --> 10:11.240]  as the ancient Jewish annals tell us that a system not of this world seeks to eradicate
[10:11.240 --> 10:20.440]  us and to remove us because it hates what planted us here, because we are made in the
[10:20.440 --> 10:28.800]  image of that and are able, on a little G level, not the big G level, not the original
[10:28.800 --> 10:37.000]  gangster level, but on the little baby G level, to build whatever we can imagine as we've
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.760]  now seen manifest.
[10:39.760 --> 10:48.920]  And so there is a race by collaborators who are working with that fallen ancient spirit,
[10:48.920 --> 10:58.000]  that ancient energy, that ancient consciousness, that ancient will Satan, and he has promised
[10:58.000 --> 11:05.680]  his minions exactly what the Bible said he would promise them, eternal life, knowledge
[11:05.680 --> 11:16.920]  of the universe, sharing with him, with it, the power of God, but first they must take
[11:16.920 --> 11:22.120]  the general population's free will, they must attack children, which are the seed of
[11:22.120 --> 11:36.040]  the universe, and we must commit horrible crimes against the great architects' will.
[11:36.040 --> 11:40.040]  When I say great architects, you're going to see all the anti-Masonic groups out there
[11:40.040 --> 11:45.640]  saying, oh, Jones is using code words for the masons, no, ladies and gentlemen, the Bible
[11:45.640 --> 11:50.200]  talks about God's architecture being seen as stars, everything the Illuminati does is
[11:50.200 --> 11:56.120]  steal all God's terms, then use them themselves, and then when we try to reappropriate God's
[11:56.120 --> 12:00.960]  language, the fools say we're of the devil, you judge a tree by its fruits.
[12:00.960 --> 12:07.080]  A sun rising symbol is not satanic, God did that, that's a symbol of the new day.
[12:07.080 --> 12:12.000]  The swastika is not an evil symbol, it's the symbol of motion and the sun rolling through
[12:12.000 --> 12:17.080]  the heavens and rolling across the mountain ranges in every culture, it's a good symbol
[12:17.080 --> 12:23.280]  just because Hitler took it doesn't mean it's bad, and so forth, and so on, but I digress,
[12:23.280 --> 12:27.880]  that's just a small piece of information.
[12:27.880 --> 12:34.840]  So here we are, ladies and gentlemen, at this key crossroads going through this great decision,
[12:34.840 --> 12:40.320]  and we see all these debates out there, the so-called conservatives on one end and the
[12:40.320 --> 12:45.960]  so-called liberal leftists on the other, and if you look at what a conservative is today,
[12:45.960 --> 12:52.080]  that would be a liberal 10 years ago, and it's all being directed by the big corporations
[12:52.080 --> 12:58.560]  and the big banks and high tech PR firms and brigades of behavioral psychologists and psychiatrists
[12:58.560 --> 13:05.320]  on record doing focus groups on every facet of our lives on ways to convince us and control
[13:05.320 --> 13:10.680]  us to turn over control of ourselves and our children and our destinies to them.
[13:10.680 --> 13:13.000]  They admit all this.
[13:13.000 --> 13:17.320]  They talk like we're little kids at the kids table and they're the big adults at the big
[13:17.320 --> 13:20.960]  table and we don't know what they're talking about, or as the analogy I used yesterday,
[13:20.960 --> 13:25.120]  it's like they're Martians speaking in their language and think we can't hear them, and
[13:25.120 --> 13:29.960]  all I'm trying to get people to do is to understand, they keep you in these controlled paradigms
[13:29.960 --> 13:35.600]  of limited debate, you know the term get outside the box, and they keep you within the allegory
[13:35.600 --> 13:37.200]  of the cave.
[13:37.200 --> 13:42.940]  They keep you within a system and feed you what input they want, and then the whole debate
[13:42.940 --> 13:46.640]  is a controlled debate where they've already moved the Overton window to the area they
[13:46.640 --> 13:52.160]  want, and then simply by having controlled opposition that isn't even conscious of the
[13:52.160 --> 13:59.400]  fact that they will cover limited aspects of it, but never bring you to the great truth
[13:59.400 --> 14:04.160]  of the fact that this is an alien attack, and then it's hiding in plain view.
[14:04.160 --> 14:10.920]  And so all of it is focusing on the symptoms and not the heart of the matter of the fact
[14:10.920 --> 14:17.200]  that we have to have a spiritual solution and that we have to see beyond the five senses
[14:17.200 --> 14:24.760]  and we have to make that sixth sense connection and transcend our spirit that is already transcended
[14:24.760 --> 14:31.920]  into the higher realms, and that by denying those higher realms, we allow anti-liberty
[14:31.920 --> 14:37.880]  forces in the universe to manipulate and control us, because we are denying the existence
[14:37.880 --> 14:44.600]  of these very energetic systems like a person jumping into a river that has a horrible rip
[14:44.600 --> 14:46.600]  tide in it and being pulled under.
[14:46.600 --> 14:50.720]  You couldn't see the currents under the water, but they were there, and that's why you see
[14:50.720 --> 14:54.680]  the spiritual blindness, that's why you see the lostness, that's why you see the confusion,
[14:54.680 --> 15:00.440]  that's why you see the system promising to its slaves just conform more to all of this
[15:00.440 --> 15:06.760]  anti-God, anti-human garbage, and somehow will build a utopia.
[15:06.760 --> 15:10.280]  But they're not building a utopia, they're building a dystopia, they're building a nightmare,
[15:10.280 --> 15:15.160]  and the people continue to double down, double down over and over and over again, and just
[15:15.160 --> 15:21.840]  hoping maybe this time they'll be delivered to heaven and to not hell while they're building
[15:21.840 --> 15:26.640]  again hell here on earth, and then, oh, they take the shot, and then they get sick, and
[15:26.640 --> 15:28.800]  it's your fault for not taking it.
[15:28.800 --> 15:34.360]  They go buy the lottery ticket, and well, it's their fault, they didn't buy more tickets,
[15:34.360 --> 15:39.440]  it's the creed of losers, how they get caught in a scam, and they won't admit they've been
[15:39.440 --> 15:41.960]  caught in a scam, and it only gets worse and worse.
[15:41.960 --> 15:45.960]  So when we come back, I'm going to talk about Dave Chappelle and his special, that's all
[15:45.960 --> 15:50.120]  the big roar and how it ties into this paradigm management control system, and what we've
[15:50.120 --> 15:59.800]  got to do, we really want to break free of this tyranny.
[15:59.800 --> 16:03.600]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[16:03.600 --> 16:08.320]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:08.320 --> 16:09.320]  Here's why.
[16:09.320 --> 16:13.280]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[16:13.280 --> 16:18.600]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most, and unlike
[16:18.600 --> 16:24.600]  gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless
[16:24.600 --> 16:27.360]  supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:27.360 --> 16:31.320]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the
[16:31.320 --> 16:36.060]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:36.060 --> 16:41.360]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses
[16:41.360 --> 16:42.360]  too.
[16:42.360 --> 16:46.000]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.

[17:00.200 --> 17:04.960]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great
[17:04.960 --> 17:05.960]  news.
[17:05.960 --> 17:08.200]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[17:08.200 --> 17:09.200]  Here's the thing.
[17:09.200 --> 17:14.760]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival soup beans.
[17:14.760 --> 17:20.040]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever,
[17:20.040 --> 17:22.840]  the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:22.840 --> 17:24.000]  The best part?
[17:24.000 --> 17:28.960]  We've dropped the price by 33 percent this week for listeners who know higher food prices
[17:28.960 --> 17:33.360]  are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.

[17:34.360 --> 17:39.040]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want

[18:00.840 --> 18:05.920]  A little more than 20 years ago, Japanese scientists discovered and were able to isolate
[18:05.920 --> 18:12.840]  a compound that is naturally in nature and in foods we eat, but in very, very low amounts.
[18:12.840 --> 18:16.240]  It's called PQQ, or biopQQ.
[18:16.240 --> 18:19.200]  When you have the organic form of it, it does amazing things.
[18:19.200 --> 18:23.960]  It actually makes your telomeres last longer, doesn't make them grow, but makes them last
[18:23.960 --> 18:25.920]  longer in the space of the same thing.
[18:25.920 --> 18:29.240]  So it's as close to the fountain of youth as you're going to get.
[18:29.240 --> 18:34.040]  Well, DNA Force Plus has been sold out for six months, it's back in stock, the highest
[18:34.040 --> 18:40.720]  quality, PQQ, CoQ10, and so much more, this entire formula is about cleaning out your cells

[19:02.160 --> 19:06.080]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul.
[19:06.080 --> 19:11.600]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet, I've had a lot of loss, like everybody else
[19:11.600 --> 19:12.600]  has.
[19:12.600 --> 19:22.320]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died
[19:22.320 --> 19:30.160]  and bled and sweat for, and now we're just throwing it all away, and I see the general
[19:30.160 --> 19:36.640]  public in a medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled
[19:36.640 --> 19:37.640]  trance.
[19:37.640 --> 19:42.880]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meagre under, and it's so incredibly sad,
[19:42.880 --> 19:50.040]  but this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating
[19:50.040 --> 19:53.600]  and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[19:53.600 --> 19:57.880]  It's just the globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence
[19:57.880 --> 20:04.000]  and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[20:04.000 --> 20:16.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:16.960 --> 20:22.280]  Turf is an acronym, stands for trans exclusionary radical feminists, this is the real thing,
[20:22.280 --> 20:27.440]  this is a group of women that hate transgender, they don't hate transgender women, but they
[20:27.440 --> 20:30.880]  look at trans women the way we blacks might look at blackface.
[20:30.880 --> 20:37.440]  It offends them, like this bitch is doing an impression on me.
[20:37.440 --> 20:48.480]  Now I shouldn't speak on this because I am not a woman, nor am I a trans, but as we've
[20:48.480 --> 20:53.480]  established, I am a feminist.
[20:53.480 --> 21:09.960]  I'm Tim Turf, I agree, I agree when gender is a fact, you have to look at it from a woman's
[21:09.960 --> 21:10.960]  perspective.
[21:10.960 --> 21:17.560]  Look at it like this, Caitlyn Jenner, whom I've met, wonderful person, Caitlyn Jenner
[21:17.560 --> 21:26.680]  was voted woman of the year, her first year as a woman, ain't that something, be every
[21:26.680 --> 21:29.840]  bitch in Detroit, she's better than all of you.
[21:29.840 --> 21:34.560]  Gender is a fact, this is a fact, every human being in this room, every human being on earth
[21:34.560 --> 21:43.440]  had to pass through the legs of a woman to be on earth, that is a fact.
[21:43.440 --> 21:47.040]  And welcome back to this Thursday edition, I'll ensure you're coming up next segment
[21:47.040 --> 21:51.440]  with all the breaking news and information plus guest, but I wanted to come into this
[21:51.440 --> 21:55.920]  segment and talk about Dave Chappelle, you just heard a clip from his Netflix special
[21:55.920 --> 21:59.560]  and I've gone and seen Dave Chappelle in concert and I've watched the shows and I think he
[21:59.560 --> 22:02.080]  is a very funny man.
[22:02.080 --> 22:08.400]  And I think, comparatively, well, looking at most comics, he has more courage than the
[22:08.400 --> 22:10.840]  average comic out there.
[22:10.840 --> 22:16.660]  That said, I did go ahead last night and watch his comedy special because so many people
[22:16.660 --> 22:21.800]  had told me I should watch his Netflix special and I really thought overall it was disappointing.
[22:21.800 --> 22:28.920]  And the reason it was disappointing is this, pointing out that women have babies that men
[22:28.920 --> 22:34.000]  are physically stronger than women and that the sexes are different, it's like saying
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.520]  humans need oxygen to breathe and then you've got the establishment corporate media saying
[22:39.520 --> 22:43.240]  no, you don't need oxygen to breathe, you don't need oxygen to survive, you don't need
[22:43.240 --> 22:49.800]  oxygen to live and then I go out and have a Netflix special and say ladies and gentlemen,
[22:49.800 --> 22:57.360]  you need to breathe oxygen for you to be able to live, humans without oxygen die.
[22:57.360 --> 23:03.120]  Now that seems like an over exaggeration, but it's not.
[23:03.120 --> 23:10.600]  If you compare saying that a man can have a baby and that a woman can be a man biologically
[23:10.600 --> 23:18.680]  and then you go around with a big tech AI system censoring biologists and other scientists
[23:18.680 --> 23:24.000]  that point out that's not true, you're living in a giant gas lit cult.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.920]  And here's the key to this.
[23:26.920 --> 23:32.120]  The people running this know it's pure bull, it's not like they're well-meaning liberals
[23:32.120 --> 23:36.720]  or leftists that we're reaching out to trying to convince otherwise.
[23:36.720 --> 23:41.600]  They want us to ignore science and data so they can give us shots that aren't vaccines
[23:41.600 --> 23:45.440]  that make us sick and kill us and even when the statistics come out that's happening,
[23:45.440 --> 23:49.360]  people are already wedded to it and committed to it as a religion, as a way of showing how
[23:49.360 --> 23:53.800]  good they are and so they're willing to hurt themselves and their children in that process
[23:53.800 --> 23:59.280]  just like every other culture when it began to collapse would sacrifice their children.
[23:59.280 --> 24:02.640]  It's horrible, it's evil, it goes against your common sense but it's that symbol of
[24:02.640 --> 24:06.840]  total submission and people would get high off of it and women love throwing their babies
[24:06.840 --> 24:12.560]  into fiery pits and watching them bubble and pop and their eyeballs pop out.
[24:12.560 --> 24:17.040]  People enjoyed cutting their children's hearts out because they were such heroes doing it
[24:17.040 --> 24:21.520]  for the earth, such heroes doing it for the system.
[24:21.520 --> 24:25.680]  So these average leftist women go to one of these abortuaries, they tell you we love
[24:25.680 --> 24:29.240]  Satan, we love the devil, we're killing babies, we love it, they say it in private, they've
[24:29.240 --> 24:33.160]  been recorded saying it but not just doing it to shock Christians.
[24:33.160 --> 24:38.120]  They're dialed in to an evil force, you'd have excuses all day for why the women do
[24:38.120 --> 24:42.000]  it or oh they got raped or this or that and of course there's real cases and real arguments
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.560]  but at the end of the day it is an evil satanic force that is making all of these arguments
[24:48.560 --> 24:54.640]  and what is satanic, anti-Christ, anti-God, anti-life, anti-common sense, anti the way
[24:54.640 --> 25:01.000]  that we're designed to be through our free will to make the right decisions and be empowered.
[25:01.000 --> 25:07.200]  And so I'm sitting there with my family watching them praise Dave Chappelle all day long yesterday
[25:07.200 --> 25:11.440]  and then watch them praise him while he speaks and how much courage he's got and how incredible
[25:11.440 --> 25:18.120]  it is and it was just like hearing somebody say that birds fly in the sky and if that's
[25:18.120 --> 25:22.960]  courage well there weren't a lot of trouble and look he said F Netflix and F all these
[25:22.960 --> 25:28.200]  guys because you know he's the rebel, he's the guy out there on the cutting edge and
[25:28.200 --> 25:33.000]  I think he actually quote means well but is he really the rebel out on the cutting edge?
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.240]  No because in the Overton window now he's accepting of all those things and he made
[25:37.240 --> 25:46.320]  the whole show about those people and made them still the spotlight while claiming he
[25:46.320 --> 25:53.880]  has a right to then diss them and say that they're not in charge of everything but still
[25:53.880 --> 25:58.360]  even if his show was wholesome and fun and good if people spend all their time online
[25:58.360 --> 26:03.520]  or all their time watching TV programs or playing video games it's unhealthy it's destructive
[26:03.520 --> 26:07.920]  even if it was a quote a good message we know it's not fulfilling.
[26:07.920 --> 26:12.160]  When we go watch a movie or watch a TV show that is not news based or facts based all
[26:12.160 --> 26:17.080]  the studies show that when we go into suspended disbelief it lowers our brain waves it lowers
[26:17.080 --> 26:22.000]  our IQ over time it contributes to all sorts of neurological disorders because your brain
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.960]  is simply watching it's not doing it's not reading and then formulating the ideas and
[26:26.960 --> 26:32.400]  imaging the things in your mind it's not listening to a radio show and having to image those
[26:32.400 --> 26:39.160]  things in the mind it is simply having it all done for it and the average human in the
[26:39.160 --> 26:45.120]  western world spends eight hours in front of a TV or devices and so even if Dave Chappelle's
[26:45.120 --> 26:49.960]  whole message was incredibly clean and incredibly good and all of it true it would be sick and
[26:49.960 --> 26:55.960]  weird to watch hours and hours and hours about men that think they're women and scientists
[26:55.960 --> 27:02.960]  trying to you know say that men are women and all the rest of this it's about domination
[27:02.960 --> 27:07.800]  it's about control it's about power that's why you see the case just this week on the
[27:07.800 --> 27:16.080]  east coast where the man dresses a woman raped the girl in the bathroom at the public school
[27:16.080 --> 27:19.480]  and then they covered it up and transferred to another school where he could then rape
[27:19.480 --> 27:23.520]  there again and when the father complained he was arrested and you say that's upside
[27:23.520 --> 27:27.960]  down that doesn't make sense of course it's upside down of course it doesn't make sense
[27:27.960 --> 27:33.040]  because it's about breaking your will will you will put up with anything they open the
[27:33.040 --> 27:37.760]  borders bringing millions of people untested for tuberculosis of the diseases spreads all
[27:37.760 --> 27:41.760]  over the US but then if you're an airline pilot they've already had COVID and don't
[27:41.760 --> 27:45.800]  want to take the so-called vaccine that doesn't protect you you're bad you're fired and Kamala
[27:45.800 --> 27:50.240]  Harris is moral and upright and good and so is Biden and you deserve to be fired but then
[27:50.240 --> 27:53.960]  the same left says oh but illegal alien they don't need to be tested for anything is bring
[27:53.960 --> 27:59.720]  them in and put their kids in school next to our kids they get TB that's how this works
[27:59.720 --> 28:04.440]  that's how these people operate and so I'm not bashing Dave Chappelle in fact you know
[28:04.440 --> 28:10.680]  I appreciate him saying the two plus two equals four but you know world where that is courage
[28:10.680 --> 28:14.120]  you know you're living in 1984 in fact it was George R. Well that said in a world of universal
[28:14.120 --> 28:20.400]  deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act and so I ask everybody is that who we've
[28:20.400 --> 28:29.640]  become is that who we are that this is a celebration that someone can come out and say this?
[28:29.640 --> 28:38.320]  Again this is an assault on humanity it's an assault on reality and we have to come back
[28:38.320 --> 28:43.320]  to the fact that disconnecting from the system and getting out of the corporate structure
[28:43.320 --> 28:48.440]  as much as we can and not valuing Hollywood and not valuing the garbage and lies they
[28:48.440 --> 28:53.480]  spew is what is going to lead us out of this tyranny.
[28:53.480 --> 28:57.800]  Now we've had two different big articles from Reuters and others come out and lie about
[28:57.800 --> 29:02.600]  info wars and COVID-19 news we broke everybody confused about staying healthy in a crazy
[29:02.600 --> 29:08.080]  COVID culture me too but listen after all the research all the conflicting studies after
[29:08.080 --> 29:12.880]  all the squabbling there's one thing almost everyone agrees on it's that immune system
[29:12.880 --> 29:17.520]  health can literally be the difference between life and death you probably already believe
[29:17.520 --> 29:21.920]  that I certainly do so here's the thing I wanted to get past the craziness and find

[31:59.280 --> 32:05.960]  your life a lot healthier I want to explain something that is absolutely heat understanding
[32:05.960 --> 32:10.880]  our world it's very very simple but the most people don't know the privately owned central
[32:10.880 --> 32:17.200]  banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other
[32:17.200 --> 32:25.800]  major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure intellectual property energy
[32:25.800 --> 32:30.840]  they're using it to buy people to buy influence and in the past they created thousands of
[32:30.840 --> 32:34.880]  trillions so that they could leverage that manipulate markets but they never allowed
[32:34.880 --> 32:40.160]  that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation now they've
[32:40.160 --> 32:45.040]  gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy buying up
[32:45.040 --> 32:50.760]  everything not to have the companies operate but to actually shut them down and force a
[32:50.760 --> 32:55.560]  collapse of civilization making the companies they do fund the only things left standing
[32:55.560 --> 32:59.920]  this is the great reset this is what's happening now war to everyone it's the only way to stop
[32:59.920 --> 33:19.320]  it you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:19.320 --> 33:26.800]  the currency the evaluation the phalates and bisphenol and the plastics destroying our
[33:26.800 --> 33:37.000]  interconsistence and rendering a sterile the open borders the funding of radical is long
[33:37.000 --> 33:45.320]  the promotion of pedophilia and transgenderism all of this is the same as poison being injected
[33:45.320 --> 33:54.160]  out of a cobra's fangs into our body politic this is an assault that's why communist china
[33:54.160 --> 33:59.280]  funds the majority of these type programs and owns four of the six major hollywood production
[33:59.280 --> 34:05.840]  houses and the very propaganda they finance in america the very poison they push on us
[34:05.840 --> 34:12.400]  it's just as deadly more deadly because it's spiritual poison and fentanyl is shipped into
[34:12.400 --> 34:19.760]  our nation and financed just like their shipment of the fentanyl is as well and so that's where
[34:19.760 --> 34:26.080]  we are and the fact that it's obon guard for dave chappelle to say i don't care who you
[34:26.080 --> 34:31.040]  are if you came to this world you came out from between a woman's legs and the fact
[34:31.040 --> 34:37.880]  that as we speak on children's forms for schools around the world the word mother and father
[34:37.880 --> 34:47.480]  has been taken off of the certificates because this is a scientific assault on who we are
[34:47.480 --> 34:56.400]  this is a scientific assault on reality and as i said in the second segment we are not
[34:56.400 --> 35:06.160]  resisting a bunch of unorganized crazy leftist and run of the mill transgender sex offenders
[35:06.160 --> 35:19.040]  like you see in the news as their vanguard above them is a scientifically directed program
[35:19.040 --> 35:26.560]  that does seek to make the biological act of procreation impossible outside of a laboratory
[35:26.560 --> 35:34.920]  in vitro setting so the end game is to take control of human development and to destroy
[35:34.920 --> 35:40.880]  the environmental systems that have allowed humans to be successful on this planet and
[35:40.880 --> 35:46.560]  to establish an economy not based on expansion not based on beauty not based on honor not
[35:46.560 --> 35:55.560]  based on humans and instead build a system that is designed for the globalist to transcend
[35:55.560 --> 36:00.480]  what they call the failed state of being human to escape this system that they're building
[36:00.480 --> 36:05.640]  for us we must first recognize that it's in a trap and that it is a military assault we
[36:05.640 --> 36:11.440]  must realize there are globalists that run it there are the think tanks and the armies
[36:11.440 --> 36:18.160]  of behavioral psychologists that think so little of us that they openly again write
[36:18.160 --> 36:22.800]  reports and brag about how they lie to us and how they dumb us down and how they control
[36:22.800 --> 36:30.440]  us and yes how they kill us so we must get out of the contained paradigm we must trend
[36:30.440 --> 36:39.640]  send the main line propaganda and realize that it's not wacky leftist that are doing
[36:39.640 --> 36:44.760]  this because they're just lost and misguided those are the slaves of the system those are
[36:44.760 --> 36:55.200]  the cannon farm of the system but that is consciously selfish completely twisted individuals
[36:55.200 --> 37:04.880]  who want to play God that are turning our planet into a giant mad scientist's laboratory
[37:04.880 --> 37:12.400]  it is not heroic to state that men are men and women are women it is simply like drawing
[37:12.400 --> 37:21.520]  air into your lungs it's time to talk about the fortune 100 the control the fortune 500
[37:21.520 --> 37:25.560]  who are owned by just a handful of families that control the issuance of currency and
[37:25.560 --> 37:31.960]  credit and that a corporate world government is being established that these corporations
[37:31.960 --> 37:38.040]  on record carry out the most heinous crimes against the populations of the world that
[37:38.040 --> 37:45.440]  we've ever seen and it's those same mega corporations wrapping themselves in the camouflage of political
[37:45.440 --> 37:52.480]  correctness to the point of almost every major corporate ad or commercial or spokesperson
[37:52.480 --> 37:59.640]  is black not just in the united states but in australia and in europe and in the uk and
[37:59.640 --> 38:06.360]  in latin america what does that have to do with american airlines what does that have
[38:06.360 --> 38:13.960]  to do with any of these things it's not to help black people it is to convince the world
[38:13.960 --> 38:21.880]  that the big corporations care about africa while africa is the main target of the globalist
[38:21.880 --> 38:27.640]  takeover you've heard the statement keep your friends close your enemies closer and that's
[38:27.640 --> 38:34.400]  exactly what big pharma and the big banks are doing with their targeting of africa then
[38:34.400 --> 38:41.280]  they train the christian west to feel sorry for past crimes generational crimes and so
[38:41.280 --> 38:46.840]  that we must now submit to the global corporations edict because the global corporations have
[38:46.840 --> 38:53.880]  dawned blackface in hopes that we will acquiesce their demands in the name of some type of
[38:53.880 --> 39:00.240]  reparations whereas it should be black people particularly that should see this understand
[39:00.240 --> 39:04.560]  what's happening and point out that just because apple gave a hundred million dollars to george
[39:04.560 --> 39:09.120]  soros organization black lives matter they do not represent black people or any other
[39:09.120 --> 39:14.440]  human's period on this planet but represent true exploitation of humanity in the most
[39:14.440 --> 39:20.040]  classical sense long story short everything the corporate media does is to dumb you down
[39:20.040 --> 39:25.120]  to poison you to make you alone so you can have all of your assets sucked out of you
[39:25.120 --> 39:33.840]  before you're killed all alone in a room strapped and tied to the wall that's their end game
[39:33.840 --> 39:38.640]  that's what the system temporarily on this planet wants the spiritual force behind it
[39:38.640 --> 39:43.880]  wants your soul now coming up on shroyer's got a ton of news to hit next segment but
[39:43.880 --> 39:49.920]  he's also going to get into two different so-called fact check stories one by Reuters
[39:49.920 --> 39:57.480]  and one by a group funded by the communist chinese that came out and said that info wars
[39:57.480 --> 40:07.680]  ran a false report last week concerning a interview that dr. Fauci and others gave in
[40:07.680 --> 40:14.560]  a panel discussion on c-span in 2019 which they talked about blowing up the system and
[40:14.560 --> 40:19.760]  how a great new virus a new entity could be brought in to get rid of the 10 year waiting
[40:19.760 --> 40:27.000]  process on old vaccines and bring in mRNA and in that 40 minute emergency report we
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.720]  shot it's now got over a million and a half views at man dot video we also played peter
[40:31.720 --> 40:38.240]  dazik admitting that they created a virus like covered 19 and a vaccine for it in 2019
[40:38.240 --> 40:44.360]  but we also played Fauci saying Trump will be challenged by a novel virus and a new
[40:44.360 --> 40:49.960]  pandemic and then I showed the London independent and I showed zero hedged info wars and the
[40:49.960 --> 40:55.560]  links to the 900 plus documents that have come out where Fauci ordered the creation
[40:55.560 --> 41:00.400]  of what is covered 19 with the four major viruses with the added gain of function from
[41:00.400 --> 41:05.400]  hiv and then his lying to congress and how they said that they would use this virus and
[41:05.400 --> 41:09.720]  operation locks to bring in all their control and so what happened is we showed in that
[41:09.720 --> 41:14.680]  40 minute piece the background them saying it them lying to congress their own documents
[41:14.680 --> 41:21.080]  admitting they created it that they created these spike protein prion crystals that could
[41:21.080 --> 41:24.760]  be sprayed on people that will go to their skin that they plan to open air release it
[41:24.760 --> 41:29.600]  in china but depending on center you crazy don't do that I mean all that happened and
[41:29.600 --> 41:33.680]  so here's the guy that engineered it made it stands to gain from it controls the worldwide
[41:33.680 --> 41:38.800]  response to it big tech sensors if you try to talk about it they try to block treatments
[41:38.800 --> 41:44.240]  for cover 19 some more die I mean these are the bad guys and then they have their fact
[41:44.240 --> 41:53.280]  check by oh here's an analogy let's say I wrote a thousand page book and in a hundred
[41:53.280 --> 42:00.080]  pages of it in a hundred pages of it at the end I tell you how to build a blacksmithing
[42:00.080 --> 42:06.360]  shop and say it's a self help book and then Reuters writes a fact check did Alex Jones
[42:06.360 --> 42:11.440]  sell a thousand page book that teaches how to build a blacksmithing shop and then they
[42:11.440 --> 42:15.400]  just simply didn't read the hundred pages or didn't write on the hundred pages and so
[42:15.400 --> 42:20.040]  the reported on the first hundred or two hundred pages and so the last hundred pages and said
[42:20.040 --> 42:24.100]  no there's nothing about blacksmithing in the book that's the same thing here lying by
[42:24.100 --> 42:28.440]  omission fouts he said it they all said it they cooked it up they ordered to be made its
[42:28.440 --> 42:32.120]  mainstream news the documents are out he lied about it and then here they are bragging about
[42:32.120 --> 42:35.680]  how they need a virus to be released so they can get rid of the regular approval process
[42:35.680 --> 42:39.240]  and do whatever they want and have this revolution to quote blow up the whole system you heard
[42:39.240 --> 42:43.120]  it you know what you're talking about criminals love to brag they're doing it out in the open
[42:43.120 --> 42:47.800]  and we have all these videos of them admitting they did it and then they actually did do it
[42:47.800 --> 42:52.760]  and now we live on so that's the reality of what's being broke down here and it's very
[42:52.760 --> 42:57.680]  dangerous and very very evil we'll go to break and come back with Owen info wars dot com tomorrow's
[42:57.680 --> 43:08.400]  news today the covid-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience a symbol of slavery a symbol
[43:08.400 --> 43:14.200]  of the chains that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations
[43:14.200 --> 43:21.080]  has put in place it is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge
[43:21.080 --> 43:26.480]  it is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad must cover our diseased criminal
[43:26.480 --> 43:35.200]  faces from the light of the sun it is the symbol of our complete and total absolute
[43:35.200 --> 43:42.920]  surrender to evil ladies and gentlemen we are crossing the rubicon now the entire future
[43:42.920 --> 43:47.120]  destiny of humanity is upon us cloud swab and the human admit they're coming out with
[43:47.120 --> 43:52.440]  implantable microchips as part of the world ID and carbon taxes things only get worse
[43:52.440 --> 43:58.640]  from here if we submit they only get better if we resist and say no non-compliance non-compliance
[43:58.640 --> 44:04.520]  non-compliance back in stock down and out liquid sleep support it's been out of stock
[44:04.520 --> 44:09.320]  for a while it's one of three sleep aids we have at info wars store dot com this one has
[44:09.320 --> 44:15.200]  been very popular sold off the shelves it's back in stock down and out liquid sleep support
[44:15.200 --> 44:23.200]  this is probably the strongest sleep aid that we have I would say knockout rocket rest both
[44:23.200 --> 44:28.040]  great comes in pill form this is the liquid tincture and I think this is probably the
[44:28.040 --> 44:33.560]  most powerful one survival shield x2 nascent iodine this is if you haven't done an iodine
[44:33.560 --> 44:37.240]  challenge yet you have you haven't done the iodine challenge what are you waiting for
[44:37.240 --> 44:43.520]  now is the time super male and super female vitality living defense plus and the organic
[44:43.520 --> 44:48.480]  greens fiber caps we have a limited supply of these right now but we want to sell them
[44:48.480 --> 44:52.640]  all out so we can order a new batch it was very popular the organic green fiber caps
[44:52.640 --> 44:57.280]  but we have all kinds of other great supplements that are great for so many different things
[44:57.280 --> 45:05.960]  take advantage of those I want to be very clear the fact that info wars is having trouble
[45:05.960 --> 45:11.320]  funding itself is not the fault of our amazing listeners and supporters it is the fault of
[45:11.320 --> 45:15.720]  the globalist when we can get enough of our great supplements other products in we're
[45:15.720 --> 45:20.080]  able to sell enough of it to stay on air and quite frankly even expand in the face of the
[45:20.080 --> 45:24.360]  new world war but because of the supply chain breakdowns that were very easy to predict the
[45:24.360 --> 45:28.920]  global lock downs we're designed to do that we have had real problems getting our best
[45:28.920 --> 45:33.280]  selling products in some of them take up to 10 months to get in we've had to discontinue
[45:33.280 --> 45:38.160]  some of our products because we just can't get the ingredients anymore it's pretty scary
[45:38.160 --> 45:42.720]  stuff so please take advantage of sales we're running for one week only there's only one
[45:42.720 --> 45:48.680]  week left from October 11th for seven days kicks off October 11th on things like DNA
[45:48.680 --> 45:56.400]  Force Plus at 40% off Winter Sun at 50% off Ultra 12 at 50% off and more at infowarstore.com
[45:56.400 --> 46:04.200]  one week left check out these incredible deals the purpose of fear is to call us into action
[46:04.200 --> 46:09.680]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today half the population has lined up for an untested
[46:09.680 --> 46:14.400]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an
[46:14.400 --> 46:19.800]  invisible asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal
[46:19.800 --> 46:25.120]  of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in
[46:25.120 --> 46:29.920]  less than nine years for those of us who have awoken from the spell we know this is all
[46:29.920 --> 46:36.160]  really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two things to do
[46:36.160 --> 46:40.400]  we continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game if enough people awaken from
[46:40.400 --> 46:46.400]  the cold spell then we win but even when we win and we eventually will the days of convenience
[46:46.400 --> 46:52.120]  are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare get up to a year's worth of storable foods
[46:52.120 --> 47:03.920]  water filtration survival gear seeds shortwave radios and life saving knowledge at infowarstore.com
[47:03.920 --> 47:14.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:14.120 --> 47:20.800]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[47:20.800 --> 47:31.040]  the info war i've got a real serious question to ask all the viewers and listeners out there
[47:31.040 --> 47:39.440]  you guys realize that you are literally humanities hope god is the reason we're gonna win this
[47:39.440 --> 47:45.440]  fight in the end but you understand god works through you and you are humanities hope and
[47:45.440 --> 47:50.360]  so we have a responsibility now because this vaccine being a poison being a bio weapon
[47:50.360 --> 47:56.040]  is not just theoretical now it's not just all those amazing experts who came out before
[47:56.040 --> 48:01.120]  the vaccine was even released and looked at what was in it and looked at past studies
[48:01.120 --> 48:05.600]  of similar systems and said hey this is gonna cause blood clots this is gonna cause infertility
[48:05.600 --> 48:13.360]  this is gonna cause ADE antibody dependent enhancement and now it's here and now we've
[48:13.360 --> 48:20.160]  got this super cold in the UK and if you notice it's the vaccinated but they're getting
[48:20.160 --> 48:24.440]  it but they're not testing positive for covid but it's very similar because it's a spike
[48:24.440 --> 48:30.880]  protein and they're dying and the British government's calling it the worst cold in
[48:30.880 --> 48:35.280]  their history isn't that funny suddenly got more blood clots and heart attacks than in
[48:35.280 --> 48:40.800]  the UK's history that was put out by the scottish government last week and suddenly the worst
[48:40.800 --> 48:47.760]  cold in history is just like covid where you can't breathe and what did all the scientists
[48:47.760 --> 48:56.880]  say what happened ADE antibody dependency enhancement antibody dependent enhancement
[48:56.880 --> 49:00.920]  and so here we are I'm gonna be talking about this a lot in a later report I'm gonna file
[49:00.920 --> 49:05.640]  and Owen's about to be covering it now but this is an emergency situation things just
[49:05.640 --> 49:09.400]  getting more and more intense and I feel so sorry for people that have taken the shots
[49:09.400 --> 49:13.400]  that I'm gonna be getting sick and dying it's already happening as predicted by top experts
[49:13.400 --> 49:18.560]  but understand they're gonna be whipped into a fury that it's our fault they're dying
[49:18.560 --> 49:23.480]  that was baked in from the beginning so as much as we love these people we need to be
[49:23.480 --> 49:28.360]  Christ like we also need to be very stern with them when they try to blame us for the
[49:28.360 --> 49:32.720]  fact that they're dead and dying or their children are dying or their parents are dying
[49:32.720 --> 49:37.120]  so it's gonna be a hellish winner as can even worse we're gonna try to make the injections
[49:37.120 --> 49:41.600]  totally mandatory once the mass death begins and big text gonna sensor anybody that tries
[49:41.600 --> 49:47.520]  to tell the truth so our worst analysis has been proven accurate and the super cold is
[49:47.520 --> 49:51.080]  here and that's what they're gonna call it the UK is the headquarters of this long with
[49:51.080 --> 49:55.200]  Australia it's from the same people and notice everything that happens there comes here so
[49:55.200 --> 49:59.360]  the beta test is it's gonna be called the super cold and they're not gonna tell you
[49:59.360 --> 50:03.280]  that it's COVID because oh you've had the vaccine so you can't get sick from COVID oh
[50:03.280 --> 50:09.680]  you're sick from something else whereas it's the vaccine and it's the antibody crisis that's
[50:09.680 --> 50:15.240]  happening the antibody dependent enhancement 80 so we told you thousands of times it was
[50:15.240 --> 50:20.000]  coming all the literature in fact showed that and now here we are it's called the super
[50:20.000 --> 50:25.840]  cold the super cold is here right on time and it's time we get Dr. Jerry Tenpenny and
[50:25.840 --> 50:30.520]  others back on the show who predicted all this it's time to get all those clips of them
[50:30.520 --> 50:34.600]  predicting it a year and a half ago a year ago and then we show it to people because
[50:34.600 --> 50:39.640]  that's one of the few things that can wake these sheep up you know all the sensor system
[50:39.640 --> 50:43.720]  systems are almost completely in place now so humans aren't really even needed on Twitter
[50:43.720 --> 50:48.520]  and Facebook and Instagram now but I bet a lot of those fact checkers and people that
[50:48.520 --> 50:52.440]  were censoring all of us feel stupid now as they themselves have taken the shot and now
[50:52.440 --> 50:57.400]  as they themselves are getting violent yelling even dying from the biochemical weapon they
[50:57.400 --> 51:01.520]  were injected with so all you that pretended you were part of the establishment went along
[51:01.520 --> 51:04.920]  with it it's still time to get right with God and repent and then to turn around and
[51:04.920 --> 51:09.600]  try to blow the whistle and save lives before this trap gets even worse into its next phase
[51:09.600 --> 51:14.000]  because this whole thing's been wargamed out all right Owen Schroeder takes over right
[51:14.000 --> 51:18.880]  now info wars.com tomorrow's news today it's a life and death situation take these articles
[51:18.880 --> 51:25.080]  take these reports and get them out to folks right now so it's something that info wars
[51:25.080 --> 51:34.760]  has been covering since the beginning of the notion with the mRNA vaccines being used
[51:34.760 --> 51:39.680]  to stop the spread of COVID and we had dozens of doctors on and those are the clips Alex
[51:39.680 --> 51:47.400]  is talking about and they said you're gonna have ADE which is where the vaccine essentially
[51:47.400 --> 51:52.960]  shuts down your natural immune system it goes in and it kills your natural immune system
[51:52.960 --> 51:58.720]  and replaces it temporarily with a synthetic immune system your immune system basically
[51:58.720 --> 52:06.800]  just gives up and then any bug or virus or disease or whatever can get in there and you
[52:06.800 --> 52:13.480]  have no immune system to fight it so you get more sick than you ever have so we just had
[52:13.480 --> 52:18.160]  the dozens of doctors on explaining this breaking this down I'm not a doctor I didn't understand
[52:18.160 --> 52:22.840]  that until it was broken down to me but now we're actually seeing it and it makes sense
[52:22.840 --> 52:27.400]  I mean if you understand the immune system and just general biology and health then yeah
[52:27.400 --> 52:34.840]  of course that's what's gonna happen so that's why they're coming out now and saying well
[52:34.840 --> 52:39.840]  you need to get COVID even if you've been vaccinated or double vaccinated well then
[52:39.840 --> 52:47.720]  why even get the vaccine well because they got to make money and they have to train you
[52:47.720 --> 52:58.200]  into the acceptance that oh well if the government mandates that I need a medical procedure well
[52:58.200 --> 53:02.480]  then that's just the case I just have to have it it doesn't matter if I don't need it it
[53:02.480 --> 53:06.200]  doesn't matter if it's gonna be detrimental to me it doesn't matter if it could kill me
[53:06.200 --> 53:11.640]  the government mandates it and the government loves me and they have a much better interest
[53:11.640 --> 53:17.000]  than I would have in my own life and in my own body so so I love big government I love
[53:17.000 --> 53:21.880]  big daddy government I love big brother government if they tell me to chop my leg off and even
[53:21.880 --> 53:25.440]  then for no reason I'll do it if they tell me to chop my hand off for no reason I'll
[53:25.440 --> 53:29.720]  do it they tell me to inject I need to inject myself with a poison I'll do it whatever the
[53:29.720 --> 53:38.880]  government says I love them so much and they love me so much so you become a profit center
[53:38.880 --> 53:44.280]  like a slave it's like oh wow you work and you make money and you get a paycheck and
[53:44.280 --> 53:47.320]  then you're forced to give it right over to big farmer you're forced to give it right over
[53:47.320 --> 53:54.520]  to whoever the government tells you to whether it's via taxes or mandates oh mandate tests
[53:54.520 --> 53:59.240]  oh mandate vaccines oh mandate this medical procedure by the way we're raising your taxes
[53:59.240 --> 54:02.360]  so who are you really working for while you're working for big pharma you're working for
[54:02.360 --> 54:11.560]  big banks you're working for whoever controls the government at that time so I've got all
[54:11.560 --> 54:16.040]  the latest news that I'm going to get into when it comes to COVID and the vaccines here
[54:16.040 --> 54:24.320]  on my desk as well as a bunch of other news but it's frustrating for now almost two years
[54:24.320 --> 54:28.880]  to be dealing with all the lies that have come out with COVID but then to see that everything
[54:28.880 --> 54:35.240]  we've been talking about has been accurate and spot on and true only to know that the
[54:35.240 --> 54:40.280]  mainstream media is not going to stop lying only to know that those that speak the truth
[54:40.280 --> 54:44.960]  or have open minds are just going to continue to be censored and ridiculed and attacked
[54:44.960 --> 54:53.920]  like Joe Rogan and while you could give Dr. Goop the credit for going on Joe Rogan and
[54:53.920 --> 55:01.400]  that's fine and Rogan I mean it appears introduce things to the one of the medical experts on
[55:01.400 --> 55:05.920]  CNN he said he'd never seen them before and it's just like how is that possible how have
[55:05.920 --> 55:09.480]  you never seen this stuff before is it because it's censored everywhere is because you don't
[55:09.480 --> 55:13.640]  want to see it is because you're lazy what is it how did you how have you never seen
[55:13.640 --> 55:17.120]  that I've ever met in his Nobel Peace Prize winning for humans how have you not been seeing
[55:17.120 --> 55:21.960]  all the massive vaccine side effects how did you not see the released memos before the
[55:21.960 --> 55:25.360]  vaccine came out saying it was going to cause all these side effects how did you not see
[55:25.360 --> 55:28.920]  that Fauci made the virus in a lab with the Chinese Communist how did you not see that
[55:28.920 --> 55:32.640]  Peter Dossick was involved how did you not see all of it he didn't see anybody he'd never
[55:32.640 --> 55:39.720]  heard of any of it he had no idea now Joe Rogan doesn't do debates but that was the
[55:39.720 --> 55:45.040]  closest thing to a COVID vaccine debate that we've had yet and you notice what was the
[55:45.040 --> 55:53.400]  result Gupta was schooled a medical doctor expert for CNN was schooled by Joe Rogan a
[55:53.400 --> 56:01.640]  podcast host and a TV show host and producer not a medical doctor that's not to slight
[56:01.640 --> 56:05.840]  Joe Rogan he obviously is very well educated and well versed on these issues but the point
[56:05.840 --> 56:11.960]  is that's a top medical expert for CNN and a doctor getting schooled by a podcast host
[56:11.960 --> 56:18.760]  and and that wasn't even a debate can you imagine if we actually had a real debate
[56:18.760 --> 56:24.920]  that was just a discussion can you imagine if we actually had a real debate about COVID
[56:24.920 --> 56:30.240]  or about the vaccines I think we all know how it would go I think we all know how that
[56:30.240 --> 56:35.600]  would go that was just a discussion Joe Rogan was being friendly to Gupta and Gupta just
[56:35.600 --> 56:40.840]  showed how he's clueless sadly but I guess we shouldn't be surprised the CNN doctor
[56:40.840 --> 56:45.200]  doesn't do research he just puts on makeup and goes on TV and has doctor in front of
[56:45.200 --> 56:51.680]  his name so CNN calls him a medical expert but that's why info wars has to be on air
[56:51.680 --> 57:00.000]  folks because and you know if one person gets this information and shares it with one person
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.680]  today then that's a victory if it's thousands that's a massive victory but it only goes
[57:04.680 --> 57:08.520]  as far as you share it and we're only here thanks to your supported info wars store

[1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:25.440]  talking about it's inevitable the collapse of america and the sick and the death and
[1:00:25.440 --> 1:00:31.040]  everything is going to be blamed on the unvaccinated here's john bound report this is economic warfare
[1:00:31.040 --> 1:00:35.520]  this is world war three let me say that again for ran paul and all the other senators that
[1:00:35.520 --> 1:00:40.520]  are halfway awake who do a great job on the topics they cover but they never address this
[1:00:40.520 --> 1:00:47.240]  the corporate controlled un directed great reset is here this is economic warfare this
[1:00:47.240 --> 1:00:53.840]  is world war three and info wars has always been the canary in the coal mine or when you
[1:00:53.840 --> 1:01:00.760]  know info wars is in trouble you know the country is on its knees and willfully sticking
[1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:06.640]  its head into the chopping block of the guillotine people ask how is info wars handling all the
[1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:11.360]  attacks and all the lies i mean i'm in this with you you're under attack i just focus
[1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:17.320]  on this i report on this and i try to expose those behind it hoping governors and legislatures
[1:01:17.320 --> 1:01:21.400]  and good people in congress are still there wake up to the full magnitude of what this
[1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:26.680]  is a foreign multinational economic warfare takeover we have an important announcement
[1:01:26.680 --> 1:01:33.560]  that will get things you buy to you to the shelves faster i'm joined by the executive
[1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:41.880]  director of the ports of los angeles and long beach gene suroka and uh and mario mario
[1:01:41.880 --> 1:01:49.760]  cordono uh i'm miss i apologize so cnn has a big article out there's a bunch of these
[1:01:49.760 --> 1:01:56.800]  uh saying that america deserve to collapse and that america didn't take all its shots
[1:01:56.800 --> 1:02:00.880]  and that's why you're not going to have any products for christmas or the food prices
[1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:04.960]  are gonna be more and uh the factories are breaking down and there's not gonna be enough
[1:02:04.960 --> 1:02:09.640]  fuel like europe and the electricity is going to be going off all because you didn't take
[1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:14.080]  your shots they say we tried to save you from covid but you didn't do a good job read the
[1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:20.160]  article and so now no it's not the covid lockdowns that did this destroying the worldwide uh
[1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:25.600]  supply chains that are still in place in african latin america no no no no it's it's not the
[1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:29.680]  20 plus million they starve to death another tens of millions of already starved at the
[1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:33.920]  numbers aren't out this year yet that's last year's numbers no ladies and gentlemen it's
[1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:38.640]  the american people's fault if only reliable trustworthy information about this pandemic
[1:02:38.640 --> 1:02:43.800]  could reach everybody instead some big name voices on the far right are peddling lies
[1:02:43.800 --> 1:02:48.920]  for profit the same thing is happening to our democracy the big lie is still with us
[1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:54.240]  here in dc trump supporters held a rally pathetic as it was in support of what they call the
[1:02:54.240 --> 1:02:58.840]  political prisoners of january 6th so much for the conspiracy theory that antifa where
[1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:03.560]  the fbi was behind the insurrection this is a great reset this is an economic war it's
[1:03:03.560 --> 1:03:07.360]  how they take you over it's cloured and pivot they can't beat capitalism they can't beat
[1:03:07.360 --> 1:03:12.040]  even corrupt versions of capitalism or even with a system where 20 percent is capitalism
[1:03:12.040 --> 1:03:18.320]  because it produces so much wealth and so much prosperity that socialism and communism
[1:03:18.320 --> 1:03:26.240]  and fascism cannot compete so the great reset is here it is a united nations directed mega
[1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:32.880]  corporation controlled takeover of society and they are issuing through the central
[1:03:32.880 --> 1:03:37.360]  banks they control unlimited currency out of all the countries of the world giving it
[1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:43.320]  to themselves while they shut down economies and shut down main street economies and farms
[1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:49.480]  and ranches and industries they're also consolidating and buying up everything right now bill gates
[1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:55.040]  has been snatching up 242 thousand acres of farmland across the u.s. enough to make him
[1:03:55.040 --> 1:03:59.760]  the top private farmland owner in america so the whole future is going to be underground
[1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:05.040]  economies us coming together us realizing we're under global corporate siege and that
[1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:10.320]  hiding from it is what got us here keeping our head down is what got us here and so many
[1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:14.120]  people that have gone along with the corruption they think that they're going to be protected
[1:04:14.120 --> 1:04:18.240]  just because they were useful idiots and went along with it as well they're going to be
[1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:23.880]  the first to lose everything they've got this follows an exact paradigm this follows an
[1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:36.120]  exact system and so it has all begun ladies and gentlemen and we're dealing with such
[1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:43.200]  stubborn narcissists that have fallen for the big lie fallen for the big crimes and
[1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:47.120]  they're just never going to let it go they're going to go down with that ship it's like
[1:04:47.120 --> 1:04:53.120]  being on a ship at sea and cannons just blasting holes blasting holes into the hub and into
[1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:56.280]  the hall and you're just taking on water and say we got to abandon ship is taking on they
[1:04:56.280 --> 1:05:04.280]  say no it's not this ship is fine so if you understand that this is not fda approved it's
[1:05:04.280 --> 1:05:11.400]  totally experimental it's never been given to human beings before some of the ingredients
[1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:17.560]  inside of these of these shots have never been injected in human beings before there
[1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:23.040]  are no long term studies we don't know what's going to happen inside your body somewhere
[1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:29.360]  four to six weeks after your second injection or four to six months or even two years we
[1:05:29.360 --> 1:05:35.920]  have no idea whether it's going to cause infertility whether it's going to cause cancer how bad
[1:05:35.920 --> 1:05:40.160]  your autoimmune disease is going to be my conclusion after looking at this for a long
[1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:44.400]  time and listening to the arguments for these masks I've determined that if you believe
[1:05:44.400 --> 1:05:49.120]  if you're a medical doctor or a scientist that's spouting using these masks you're either
[1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:55.600]  being played or you're being paid secure your copy of covidland today at covidland.com if
[1:05:55.600 --> 1:06:15.120]  you order by October 6 you get a free copy of in game blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:06:15.120 --> 1:06:33.200]  Okay let me just do a show reset here as I am taking over host duties for the remainder
[1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:40.400]  of the alex joneshow I have a guest coming up alex stein who maybe it's alex stein maybe
[1:06:40.400 --> 1:06:46.640]  it's alex zander stein I don't know neither does the dallas city council so uh you're
[1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:51.920]  not going to want to miss that looking forward to that Kate dally hosts the fourth hour and
[1:06:51.920 --> 1:06:57.520]  then I'll be back hosting the war room from three to six and I have enough news on my
[1:06:57.520 --> 1:07:05.040]  desk for five hours of news coverage that I'm set to embark on right now not to mention
[1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:09.240]  all of the video clips but let me just just do a reset here on the alex joneshow and kind
[1:07:09.240 --> 1:07:18.880]  of give you the waterfront the censorship is only ramping up and it's and it's reaching
[1:07:18.880 --> 1:07:24.360]  new levels of censorship so it's not just a political censorship it's anybody who shows
[1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:30.320]  any semblance of being a patriot or a free thinker or a truth teller that has a large
[1:07:30.320 --> 1:07:39.800]  platform they're being eliminated it's canceling songs you remember they they canceled that
[1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:44.880]  one christmas song because it talks about a man and a woman getting together and cuddling
[1:07:44.880 --> 1:07:52.640]  together in the cold and snuggling and oh my gosh oh jeez we can't have that we can't
[1:07:52.640 --> 1:07:57.680]  have men and women coming together and being romantic and snuggling and cuddling and oh
[1:07:57.680 --> 1:08:07.280]  my goodness gracious it's just just the horror of it all so bad and now anything you talk
[1:08:07.280 --> 1:08:14.440]  about that doesn't go along with the global death cult is getting removed from the internet
[1:08:14.440 --> 1:08:21.680]  so it's like oh my gosh that man just touched that woman's arm and just oh oh oh it's so
[1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:26.960]  inappropriate oh my god but then they'll send pedophiles to your school to do lap dances
[1:08:26.960 --> 1:08:34.200]  for them so that's good see man and women men and women man and woman combined love sex

[1:08:57.480 --> 1:09:06.240]  here how they're I've never seen the attacks on children or the having of children I should
[1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:10.400]  say the birthing of children men and women having kids I've never seen the attacks on
[1:09:10.400 --> 1:09:16.080]  it so much and it's a weird instinctual thing it's like I'm so anti-establishment I'm so
[1:09:16.080 --> 1:09:22.120]  anti-new world order it like pushes my psyche and consciousness in ways that I have no control
[1:09:22.120 --> 1:09:27.560]  of I'm 32 I don't have any kids I want to have kids but I felt like yeah you know God
[1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:32.400]  will give it the time and I just see all this stuff saying never have kids kids are bad kids
[1:09:32.400 --> 1:09:36.200]  are the worst thing ever don't have kids you demon now it's like wow I really need to start
[1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:39.800]  making kids huh if that's what pisses the new world order off I ought to start cranking
[1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:47.640]  them out yes see that's okay but oh the song brown sugar by the Rolling Stones is now banned
[1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:53.640]  oh my gosh brown sugar is he talking about is he talking about a beautiful woman with
[1:09:53.640 --> 1:10:00.600]  dark skin complexion I just oh my god oh it's a person of color oh I'm so sorry guys ban
[1:10:00.600 --> 1:10:10.560]  me cancel me okay and then you have how is Biden how is the Biden administration gonna
[1:10:10.560 --> 1:10:16.800]  cover this up it's kind of like what the mayor of Austin just did violent crime is skyrocketing
[1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:21.200]  in Austin poverty is skyrocketing in Austin and he comes out and makes a statement today
[1:10:21.200 --> 1:10:27.720]  saying yeah we're having mass crime waves and and and we're seeing mass homelessness and
[1:10:27.720 --> 1:10:31.200]  it's not a good situation but that's just that's just what happens in big cities it's
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:38.600]  not my fault wrong that's what happens in Democrat run cities ah that's what's happened
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:43.440]  in Austin now because of our Democrat mayor but so how is the Biden administration gonna
[1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:51.080]  cover up the massive inflation the massive increase in the consumer price index the stalling
[1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:55.760]  of the shipments in the ports and the cargo and the oil and everything I mean just the
[1:10:55.760 --> 1:10:59.800]  total beginning of the collapse of our economy the economic warfare that's happening right
[1:10:59.800 --> 1:11:06.080]  now how are they going to cover that up well maybe they're gonna blame you the unvaccinated
[1:11:06.080 --> 1:11:10.400]  person you say well that doesn't make any logical sense nothing they do makes logical
[1:11:10.400 --> 1:11:16.200]  sense why would we ever hold them to that standard and so we've got more on that and
[1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:20.640]  they're admitting it now folks they're admitting get ready there's gonna be total shortages
[1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:27.360]  by Christmas your your heating bills are gonna skyrocket food and water is gonna be scarce
[1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:31.080]  and look hey look we live in a we live in a capitalist country and we're lucky that we
[1:11:31.080 --> 1:11:38.360]  have so much excess that you're most likely you in the audience are not gonna starve from
[1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:42.160]  the massive supply chain shortages that are coming it's not gonna be like Venezuela overnight
[1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:46.800]  but you're going to see it you're going to see empty shelves you there's gonna be goods
[1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:50.760]  and services that you're used to having and having easy access to that you're not gonna
[1:11:50.760 --> 1:11:55.080]  have anymore and it's not gonna totally ruin our country yet it's not gonna totally devastate
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:12:01.200]  us yet but you're going to see it and it's going to frustrate you for example and this
[1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:06.480]  is more of the just Democrat crime waves that are happening where there's dozens of Walgreens
[1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:11.320]  closing in California and now people are really mad because they fill up their prescription
[1:12:11.320 --> 1:12:15.880]  to Walgreens or Walgreens is where they go for just you know daily needs and necessities
[1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:19.600]  and they're all gone they have nowhere to go now there's no Walgreens because the Walgreens
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:25.720]  are all closed because there was so much what they call organized retail crime now this is
[1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:31.360]  a new phenomenon only happens in Democrat run cities organized retail crime where large
[1:12:31.360 --> 1:12:36.880]  groups of people run into retail shops like Walgreens and just steal mass amounts of things
[1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:41.160]  just filling multiple trash bags and backpacks and then they just run out of the store so
[1:12:41.160 --> 1:12:45.320]  you'll have so so instead of losing all the money because of the theft and having empty
[1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:50.440]  shelves because of the massive theft they just close the store so Walgreens doesn't care
[1:12:50.440 --> 1:12:54.840]  it's a part of Walmart they don't care they've got billions of dollars so they can close
[1:12:54.840 --> 1:12:58.320]  their doors and all right fine their bottom line is barely affected fact it works out
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:02.720]  better for them because now they're not taking massive losses due to the organized retail
[1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:07.320]  crime oh that's nice open the door for them to it's white supremacist doing it by the
[1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:14.640]  way and don't tell me just because their skin isn't white that it's not white supremacist
[1:13:14.640 --> 1:13:18.480]  that standard is gone don't you know Larry Elder white supremacist the Democrats told
[1:13:18.480 --> 1:13:24.320]  me Dave Chappelle is now a white supremacist too so it's not a skin thing a white supremacist
[1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:29.840]  thing is now a if you're a political opposition to the newer loader of the Democrat Party
[1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:35.480]  doesn't matter what your skin color is you're a white supremacist that's their logic and
[1:13:35.480 --> 1:13:40.120]  these people want to lead the planet then my biggest stack of news over here is just
[1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:48.400]  more COVID more vaccine stuff I can do this every day and I do and I don't like being
[1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:55.880]  redundant in fact it it drives me insane being redundant but I'm going to cover the news
[1:13:55.880 --> 1:14:01.800]  every day and every day there's more people that have died from the vaccine and every
[1:14:01.800 --> 1:14:06.200]  day there's more people having massive side effects from the vaccine and so we just cover
[1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:11.920]  it every day now it's basketball players that can't play basketball anymore hockey players
[1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:16.640]  that can't play hockey anymore runners that can't run anymore fighters that can't fight
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:23.000]  anymore every single one forced to get the vaccine now they can't engage in their athletic
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:30.400]  activity that gruesome story that came out of Loudoun County about the boy that dresses
[1:14:30.400 --> 1:14:35.320]  as a girl and goes into the bathroom and sexually assaults girls that's now been confirmed
[1:14:35.320 --> 1:14:38.560]  so first they tried to act like well this this parent is just out of control we weren't
[1:14:38.560 --> 1:14:42.880]  covering up that crime no they did cover it up so they could pass a bill and then the
[1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:48.120]  boy that dresses like a girl raped they won't say rape they keep saying sexual sexual assault
[1:14:48.120 --> 1:14:53.280]  but they claim there's penetration so last I checked that was rape but okay we'll be
[1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:57.200]  politically correct it was just sexual assault and there's no me too movement to protect
[1:14:57.200 --> 1:15:03.880]  those young girls they got sexually assaulted into their bathrooms because Democrats is
[1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:10.840]  why because Democrats and so I've got all that coming up and then all kinds of video
[1:15:10.840 --> 1:15:20.280]  clips as well where they're just admitting can you imagine though I guess it was almost
[1:15:20.280 --> 1:15:25.280]  a year I guess it was more than a year ago when we started seeing the Democrats adopting
[1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:30.960]  the UN World Government slogan of build back better the UN World Government was using that
[1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:37.880]  slogan years ago in their documents in their published documents and then it got adopted
[1:15:37.880 --> 1:15:43.440]  by the Democrat Party in 2019 when they were campaigning now it's here so it's not Bill
[1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:48.680]  of Rights it's not freedom of speech it's not Second Amendment it's it's not the Constitution
[1:15:48.680 --> 1:15:55.600]  it's nothing that is America freedom free market no it's it's build back better destroy
[1:15:55.600 --> 1:16:03.920]  the free market build back in a communist world government have you ever thought about turning

[1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:15.080]  front line so my time is not recommended to get vaccinated that was the current CEO of
[1:18:15.080 --> 1:18:22.600]  Pfizer just a few months ago on a national TV interview saying oh he doesn't need to
[1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:28.960]  take the so-called MRNA vaccine is really a gene therapy he said you know he's 57 years
[1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:33.760]  old he's healthy he doesn't need it it's at risk people but that's not what is PR firms
[1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:38.640]  that have bought off the politicians over 100 countries say they say you've got to take
[1:18:38.640 --> 1:18:43.280]  it to have a job or leave your house or get on a plane or a train or even get outside
[1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:49.200]  your home for one hour a day to live in australia so remember the White House is exempt congress
[1:18:49.200 --> 1:18:54.360]  and their staff are exempt the postal service is exempt all these big corporate heads are
[1:18:54.360 --> 1:18:59.040]  exempt they're not taking their poison vaccine they're pushing it on you wake up folks wake
[1:18:59.040 --> 1:19:06.040]  up you'd have to be hiding under a rock not to know that vitamin D vitamin C zinc and
[1:19:06.040 --> 1:19:10.440]  other essential vitamins and minerals are essential to our bodies to our immune systems
[1:19:10.440 --> 1:19:15.600]  we don't have them long term we die but what a lot of people don't know is even if you
[1:19:15.600 --> 1:19:22.480]  have those compounds the levels that are recommended if you don't have deep restful clean sleep
[1:19:22.480 --> 1:19:26.840]  your body will fall apart even faster and with so many chemicals in the food and water
[1:19:26.840 --> 1:19:31.320]  and so much agitation in the culture and life it's hard to settle down it's hard to relax
[1:19:31.320 --> 1:19:35.720]  well let me tell you something right now down and out is an incredibly strong natural
[1:19:35.720 --> 1:19:40.720]  compound it's got over eight compounds in it that will give you deep pure clean sleep
[1:19:40.720 --> 1:19:44.600]  and it's it's such a game changer so with all the vitamins and minerals the last big
[1:19:44.600 --> 1:19:50.760]  ingredient is down and out available again at m4warstore.com for 50% off and you know
[1:19:50.760 --> 1:19:54.560]  what I'm going to keep it 50% off until it sells out even though we've already sold out
[1:19:54.560 --> 1:19:58.000]  a half of it in just the last month and we probably are going to have more for about
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:20.760]  five months.
[1:20:20.760 --> 1:20:27.520]  So we've discussed the COVID tyranny the medical tyranny a lot so far today but that
[1:20:27.520 --> 1:20:34.880]  is just the entry that is just the gateway into totalitarian authoritarian world government
[1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:43.120]  tyranny and it is ushering us in rapidly ladies and gentlemen and a lot of people can see
[1:20:43.120 --> 1:20:47.640]  it a lot of people are frustrated by it a lot of people in denial of it but yet here
[1:20:47.640 --> 1:20:53.360]  we are and you're seeing the signs and symptoms now I have more people that reach out to me
[1:20:53.360 --> 1:21:00.880]  than ever because they're just freaked out by all of this and I think that it's important
[1:21:00.880 --> 1:21:07.800]  to communicate it's not going away it's not going away because even though Rand Paul has
[1:21:07.800 --> 1:21:14.560]  taken some good stands and he's gone against Fauci and he's declared a mass peaceful non-compliance
[1:21:14.560 --> 1:21:21.840]  and there's other great people in Congress but it's a small force and overall it's not
[1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:29.120]  an obstacle to the medical tyranny that we are being subjected to right now it'd be like
[1:21:29.120 --> 1:21:37.720]  putting a rock you know the size of your fingernail in front of a car and saying this rock is
[1:21:37.720 --> 1:21:41.640]  going to stop the car no the car is going to drive right over the rock or it won't even
[1:21:41.640 --> 1:21:45.200]  have an impact at all it had no problem.
[1:21:45.200 --> 1:21:49.680]  Now the biggest rock put in front of that car would be Info Wars that's why they had
[1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:56.640]  to take us off the road but even Info Wars would not be big enough to stop it.
[1:21:56.640 --> 1:22:04.760]  But it's the entire population it's mass peaceful non-compliance of the population that can
[1:22:04.760 --> 1:22:11.160]  make an obstacle big enough but even then it would be a battle there needs to be a real
[1:22:11.160 --> 1:22:18.760]  opposition to this in government in the corporate government in the media everywhere that's
[1:22:18.760 --> 1:22:26.360]  the only hope we have but I explain to people if you don't like the medical tyranny from
[1:22:26.360 --> 1:22:32.360]  COVID this isn't going anywhere this is just a precedent being set the next level which
[1:22:32.360 --> 1:22:36.240]  sadly I have to say I think we're going to get to I think we're going to see it right
[1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:39.800]  to within two or three years it's going to be worse than the COVID tyranny and that's
[1:22:39.800 --> 1:22:46.080]  going to be the climate tyranny so we'll get to that coming up but what are the real
[1:22:46.080 --> 1:22:51.600]  world implications what are the real world effects that people are going to see and
[1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:58.560]  have to deal with well with COVID it's the vaccine mandates it's the government shutting
[1:22:58.560 --> 1:23:05.600]  down businesses or mandating this or mandating that almost everybody's had some level of
[1:23:05.600 --> 1:23:10.860]  dealing with that it's been a lot worse for some than others but what about when it comes
[1:23:10.860 --> 1:23:14.840]  to climate change what's the overall impact of all of this well you have to understand
[1:23:14.840 --> 1:23:21.000]  first out of the gates that the world leaders and sadly our own leaders here in America
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  have just decided that America has added too good for too long America's been too rich
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:34.160]  and too happy and too successful and too free for too long so it just has to end your your
[1:23:34.160 --> 1:23:39.880]  joy rides coming to an end there's too many people suffering on planet earth and so America
[1:23:39.880 --> 1:23:46.760]  you've got it too good and so it's now official world government policy to put Americans into
[1:23:46.760 --> 1:23:53.520]  bondage as a punishment because we've had it too good where instead the world should
[1:23:53.520 --> 1:23:58.160]  be looking at America saying wow what is it about America that makes it so great maybe
[1:23:58.160 --> 1:24:03.400]  we should adopt that it's the free market it's small government it's the bill of rights
[1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:08.720]  it's the Constitution you can go on and on so instead of adopting all the things that
[1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:13.720]  made America so amazing that made it the best country to live in that made it the most prosperous
[1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:17.800]  that gave us the highest standard of living that gave us the ease of access that gave
[1:24:17.800 --> 1:24:24.040]  us all the innovation that gave us the excess instead of adopting that worldwide instead
[1:24:24.040 --> 1:24:31.240]  they just say no America must pay for their success so we're going to punish America for
[1:24:31.240 --> 1:24:39.200]  being so successful hmm so you may say well well that doesn't make sense you're right
[1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:44.880]  but let's go to the next level of the psychology here it does make sense when you're an atheist
[1:24:44.880 --> 1:24:52.960]  or a nihilist that believes now humans are a parasite on planet earth they may even believe
[1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:56.720]  that we were designed as a parasite they may even believe that that's just our destiny
[1:24:56.720 --> 1:25:01.400]  we're a parasite like a parasite that lives in you or a cancer that lives in you so they've
[1:25:01.400 --> 1:25:06.680]  decided that humanity has to be called off the planet earth or there won't be a planet
[1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:11.800]  earth and that's when the climate change comes in which is just just a buzzword just another
[1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:19.120]  big narrative lie to bring in the tyranny so that's that's the mental thought process
[1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:24.560]  of the new world order that's the thought process of the global government that's why
[1:25:24.560 --> 1:25:30.800]  we're going through everything we're going through that's why you hear Michael Specter
[1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:36.040]  with Anthony Fauci saying we need more death that's literally he says that I mean it sounds
[1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:39.160]  crazy me saying that on air we had a whole special report on it the other night that's
[1:25:39.160 --> 1:25:43.640]  why you see articles like that saying I cheer on the extinction of mankind that's why Bill
[1:25:43.640 --> 1:25:47.720]  Gates says we need to get the population down to zero because because this is their ideology
[1:25:47.720 --> 1:25:54.040]  this is what they believe in and so you may believe in that too you may not you're going
[1:25:54.040 --> 1:26:02.400]  to be subjected to it and so here's the real world breakdown Pete Buddha judges inexperience
[1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:08.080]  exposed as supply chain breaks down story from the hill and it's all about all the shipments
[1:26:08.080 --> 1:26:12.200]  and all the containers and all the cargo and all the oil sitting off coast not being allowed
[1:26:12.200 --> 1:26:19.520]  to come in and they act like oh this is because Pete Buddha judge is inexperienced and he
[1:26:19.520 --> 1:26:27.760]  just can't do the job wrong he was told we'll give you this job do exactly what we say you'll
[1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:33.200]  climb the ranks in the Democrat Party you obviously have presidential aspirations so
[1:26:33.200 --> 1:26:38.840]  all you got to do is fill this chair take this name placard and just do nothing or do
[1:26:38.840 --> 1:26:43.520]  exactly what we say so he'll get scapegoated for the supply chain shortage but it's not
[1:26:43.520 --> 1:26:47.680]  his fault he's just doing what he's told he's just a good foot soldier of the Democrat Party
[1:26:47.680 --> 1:26:54.760]  now so yes that's part of the impact of the global government by design supply chain shortage
[1:26:54.760 --> 1:27:02.360]  in the West White House asks US oil and gas companies to help lower fuel costs because
[1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:08.960]  they're rising significantly because Joe Biden has a policy to shut US oil down and he did
[1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:14.520]  that and by the way the oil companies aren't going to respond to this you saw Putin came
[1:27:14.520 --> 1:27:18.320]  out the other day and said yeah we're going to be looking at a future where there's $100
[1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:23.280]  a barrel oil because the oil companies are going to continue living the way that they
[1:27:23.280 --> 1:27:27.880]  live and pricing things the way they price they don't give a damn what the government
[1:27:27.880 --> 1:27:35.920]  says so you can say hey they're good hey they're bad they're just doing business as usual winter
[1:27:35.920 --> 1:27:41.880]  heating bills set to jump as inflation hits home so you may have seen that a little bit
[1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:49.120]  last year it's going to be even worse this year they may even shut they may even shut
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:54.280]  you down and limit how much natural gas or how much electricity you can use by the end
[1:27:54.280 --> 1:27:59.000]  of this year they already do that in California they already tried to do that in Texas so
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:03.440]  that's going to be the new normal you go to turn the heat on at your house nothing happens
[1:28:03.440 --> 1:28:07.680]  you say what's happening my heat doesn't work you call the repairman they say no no no your
[1:28:07.680 --> 1:28:12.000]  heat works just fine they shut it down at the government they shut it down at the facility
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:16.680]  that provides the heat because the government told them to because of climate change and
[1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:22.240]  then here's the fear mongering campaign just like they do with COVID see how climate change
[1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:27.600]  could put coastal cities two-thirds of world's population underwater NBC News and if you guys
[1:28:27.600 --> 1:28:31.960]  can before we go to the break here 30 seconds pull it up because they have these graphics
[1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:36.280]  that they show of all these cities underwater and baseball stadiums underwater and people
[1:28:36.280 --> 1:28:42.440]  drowning and that's the fear mongering they've been predicting this for decades they had to
[1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:46.560]  take all the signs that says these glaciers will be melted by 2020 out of the national
[1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:51.600]  parks the glacier national parks because they didn't melt go watch Al Gore's documentary
[1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:55.280]  in convenient truth we were all supposed to be drowned by now they've been lying about
[1:28:55.280 --> 1:28:58.880]  this for decades they still do it because they're still out there and nobody checks them on
[1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:05.160]  it so many people say to me Alex please stop being so negative well for me admitting I've
[1:29:05.160 --> 1:29:11.400]  gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative it hurts it stinks it's
[1:29:11.400 --> 1:29:15.440]  got pus coming out of it I go to the doctor they fix it that's not negative I'm not living
[1:29:15.440 --> 1:29:21.600]  in denial and so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we feel yet but
[1:29:21.600 --> 1:29:26.120]  now it's come to the surface that's actually a positive thing and so yeah Trump did an
[1:29:26.120 --> 1:29:31.360]  overall great job they stole the election we can't get down about that we have forced
[1:29:31.360 --> 1:29:37.080]  them out in the open so now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been
[1:29:37.080 --> 1:29:41.160]  exposed they're scared that's why instead of saying oh we're a bunch of losers look
[1:29:41.160 --> 1:29:45.160]  what happened no we're a bunch of winners they're trying to suppress us let our light
[1:29:45.160 --> 1:29:51.000]  of truth shine and tell everybody what's happening your own website your own show my show other

[1:30:01.400 --> 1:30:08.360]  20 years ago Japanese scientists discovered we're able to isolate a compound that is naturally
[1:30:08.360 --> 1:30:15.320]  in nature and in foods we eat but in very very low amounts it's called PQQ or bio PQQ

[1:33:28.680 --> 1:33:34.400]  and symptoms of the world government tyranny that we're seeing COVID is just the beginning
[1:33:34.400 --> 1:33:44.520]  COVID is just the entryway the portal it's open borders it's no more nation states Biden
[1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:49.600]  gives work permits to nearly 32,000 border crosses in the last two border crossers in
[1:33:49.600 --> 1:33:54.120]  the last two months that's illegal border crossers and then they've also just released
[1:33:54.120 --> 1:33:59.520]  numbers that it was like 300,000 released since the beginning of August and these numbers
[1:33:59.520 --> 1:34:08.280]  are just small potatoes compared to the larger numbers that are going to be in the millions
[1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:12.520]  when it's all said and done the millions of illegal border crossings that have happened
[1:34:12.520 --> 1:34:19.560]  now what happens when they get here okay so work permits to 32,000 okay you think well
[1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:28.240]  maybe they're coming here they're going to work well 32,000 out of how many 500,000
[1:34:28.240 --> 1:34:35.440]  five million what about the rest you're paying for them now you're paying for food over there
[1:34:35.440 --> 1:34:39.960]  or you're paying for food on their plate you're playing for you're paying for a roof over
[1:34:39.960 --> 1:34:48.360]  their head you're paying for them to live in America that's why the former I forget who
[1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:53.400]  it was in the Trump administration came out he worked with Border Patrol he said the illegal
[1:34:53.400 --> 1:34:57.880]  immigration crisis is costing America billions of dollars because we're paying for all of
[1:34:57.880 --> 1:35:02.360]  this we're paying for them to come in we're paying to transport them we're paying to feed
[1:35:02.360 --> 1:35:06.960]  them we're paying to clothe them we're paying to put them in a home we're paying for all
[1:35:06.960 --> 1:35:10.840]  of that why would why should we have to pay for that we have Americans struggling we have
[1:35:10.840 --> 1:35:17.160]  veterans struggling we're having a supply chain shortage and now we're still supposed to be
[1:35:17.160 --> 1:35:25.760]  the caretakers of the world as we're under attack and so let's just flash back a week
[1:35:25.760 --> 1:35:29.600]  because I told you nothing was going to happen and nothing has Abbott and other Republican
[1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:35.480]  governors unveiled 10 point plan to end border crisis that was last week has anything happened
[1:35:35.480 --> 1:35:42.720]  no not a damn thing not a damn thing and nothing is going to change so that's what's just so
[1:35:42.720 --> 1:35:49.120]  frustrating it's seeing all this happening seeing no real resistance to it seeing a bunch
[1:35:49.120 --> 1:36:04.080]  of lip service and no real action there there is no true resistance with any concrete structure
[1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:12.960]  if you will to stopping this open border this medical tyranny the climate tyranny it's nothing
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:20.320]  it's info wars pounding our heads every day trying to wake people up and then it's politicians
[1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:24.440]  doing lip service with no real action so hey that was great a bunch of governors met down
[1:36:24.440 --> 1:36:27.920]  there at the border they said we're going to close the southern border this is a disaster
[1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:33.640]  we're going to do it here we are a week later bubkus and I'll check back in a month and it'll
[1:36:33.640 --> 1:36:40.960]  be bubkus and I'll check back in a year and it'll be bubkus some leaders are starting
[1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:49.200]  to stand up and say the right things but they're just few and far between they don't get the
[1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:57.680]  back up the support that they need archbishop Vagano says Pope Francis is a zealous cooperator
[1:36:57.680 --> 1:37:03.840]  in the great reset and will preside over the demolition of the Catholic Church if he hasn't
[1:37:03.840 --> 1:37:09.080]  already that's just like Joe Biden he's a zealous cooperator in the great reset he will preside
[1:37:09.080 --> 1:37:12.680]  over the demolition of the United States of America that's what they've done they've
[1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:17.600]  put all their puppets in the position of power to oversee the destruction of all of these
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:24.720]  different institutions that are so big whether it's the Catholic Church or the United States
[1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:28.680]  of America destroy the Catholic Church bring it into the new world order now you've got
[1:37:28.680 --> 1:37:34.240]  the Catholics and the Catholic Church into the one world government destroy America bring
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:38.920]  it into the new world order now you've got America into the world government Biden overseeing
[1:37:38.920 --> 1:37:47.040]  the whole thing just as they intended just as they intended here's the headline from
[1:37:47.040 --> 1:37:56.240]  zero hedge here is the hidden $150 trillion agenda behind the crusade against climate
[1:37:56.240 --> 1:38:02.680]  change and this is $150 trillion and so this is just Democrats paying themselves pretending
[1:38:02.680 --> 1:38:06.720]  they're trying to do anything because money stops weather don't you know money stops weather
[1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:12.480]  oh you didn't know that come on come on man here's where some of that trillions here's
[1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:18.760]  where some of those trillions are going treasury to study impact of climate on households and
[1:38:18.760 --> 1:38:24.480]  communities and it'll just be gifts just massive grants gifted to the Democrats and their little
[1:38:24.480 --> 1:38:28.920]  subsidiaries treasury launches and Republicans to I shouldn't just say Democrats Republicans
[1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:35.080]  do this to treasury launches effort on climate related financial risks mmm but shutting down
[1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:40.160]  the economy that's fine but but weather and financial risk well that's we got to study
[1:38:40.160 --> 1:38:47.100]  that they got to study that climate scenario analysis will help identify risks climate
[1:38:47.100 --> 1:38:52.800]  change could have profound economic effects fed looks at climate change from view of risks
[1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:59.760]  to banks fed is taking the right course on monitoring climate change fed should consider
[1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:06.760]  climate change risk to financial system but you the citizen you the American you the human
[1:39:06.760 --> 1:39:13.800]  where do you fit into all this in shackles that's where this isn't about you this is
[1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:19.120]  about the human this is about the individual this is about the global government 150 trillion
[1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:30.000]  for them for them so that's where all of this is going so you say yeah you know I'm sick
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:34.400]  of the mask and I'm sick of the vaccine mandates and I'm sick of all this garbage I see from
[1:39:34.400 --> 1:39:39.920]  covid that's going to be like child's play when you get into the global government tyranny
[1:39:39.920 --> 1:39:45.000]  of climate change and by the way just to show you the fear mongering guys pull up that article
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:48.080]  I mentioned at the last segment at the end of it that we didn't have time to get to just
[1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:52.240]  pull up the images so they do the fear mongering with covid because they run the same play all
[1:39:52.240 --> 1:39:56.480]  the time and that's all this is folks we just info wars just calls out the plays we're
[1:39:56.480 --> 1:40:01.320]  just the best play-by-play color commentators in the game that's just the truth and so we're
[1:40:01.320 --> 1:40:05.680]  just calling out the plays so here's them fear mongering now over climate change in this
[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:10.920]  NBC story and they show the Statue of Liberty flooded and they show baseball stadiums flooded
[1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:16.800]  and theme parks flooded and neighborhoods flooded because they have to fear monger just like
[1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:21.920]  they did with covid oh you're all going to die look at all the dead look at all the dying
[1:40:21.920 --> 1:40:27.600]  we're doomed and they fear mongered that in the media 24 7 this is the next level fear
[1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:32.860]  mongering for climate tyranny to be brought in show you all you're going to die from a
[1:40:32.860 --> 1:40:37.360]  flood you're going to die from an earthquake you're going to die from a forest fire you're
[1:40:37.360 --> 1:40:40.900]  going to die because a glacier melted you're going to you're going to die that's what it

[1:40:57.640 --> 1:41:02.120]  as they're killing you with the vaccines, as they're killing you with the poisons in the food
[1:41:02.120 --> 1:41:04.760]  and water. Take a look at this one, I was gonna cover it later, I'll just bring it up to you now.
[1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:12.840]  Chemicals found in food containers, shampoo and children's toys may contribute to 100,000 early
[1:41:12.840 --> 1:41:18.040]  deaths a year among people aged 55 to 64 in the U.S., according to a new study.
[1:41:18.040 --> 1:41:27.480]  Yeah, it's all been put there intentionally because the secret corporate world government decided
[1:41:27.480 --> 1:41:31.640]  long ago that there's too many humans and they need population control. That's why they fund
[1:41:31.640 --> 1:41:38.440]  Planned Parenthood that kills millions of babies. Yes, that's why they love abortions so much,
[1:41:38.440 --> 1:41:41.320]  that's why they don't tell you about all the poisons in the food and the water.
[1:41:42.760 --> 1:41:47.880]  And then people see like documentaries like Food Inc. or other things and they're just stunned and
[1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:55.240]  they're just shocked. How could this be going on? Because there's an agenda to call the human
[1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:58.840]  population off the earth, you can deny it all you want, but they're telling it to you,
[1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:02.760]  they're showing it to you, it couldn't be more obvious about it.
[1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:08.840]  So let's just go, you know, I'll have to come back and play Pelosi talking about this
[1:42:09.640 --> 1:42:15.880]  and then saying, oh well, it's their moral responsibility to conquer the planet in the
[1:42:15.880 --> 1:42:22.360]  name of climate change. It's their moral responsibility. Morals, morals from this
[1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:27.880]  government, morals from these politicians, morals, they're going to tell us about morals
[1:42:28.920 --> 1:42:36.280]  as they celebrate baby murder, as they celebrate ending human freedom, as they lie to us 24 seven,
[1:42:36.280 --> 1:42:41.640]  and I'm going to sit here and be lectured by a demon like Nancy Pelosi about morals.
[1:42:41.640 --> 1:42:51.560]  Uh, I don't think so. So just understand the COVID medical tyranny was just the entry phase,
[1:42:51.560 --> 1:43:11.560]  the gateway and the portal into the real tyrannical agenda to shut you down, climate tyranny.
[1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:39.320]  So

[1:45:04.040 --> 1:45:09.880]  globalist. I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their
[1:45:09.880 --> 1:45:15.480]  tracks before they went operational. But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not
[1:45:15.480 --> 1:45:21.800]  getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[1:45:21.800 --> 1:45:26.680]  great reset. And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[1:45:26.680 --> 1:45:30.840]  tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear
[1:45:30.840 --> 1:45:35.240]  the truth. So we've got an information warfare, the enemy and trying to stop their agenda. We've
[1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:39.000]  also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high quality
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:44.520]  storable food. You got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at info or store.com.

[1:46:09.720 --> 1:46:17.080]  for seven days. That's because a bunch of these products that we have in stock are limited supply
[1:46:17.080 --> 1:46:22.840]  because obviously the supply chain breakdown that I've been warning you of now for 20 months,
[1:46:22.840 --> 1:46:26.920]  because that's part of the great reset and part of the global's plan. That's what global lockdowns
[1:46:26.920 --> 1:46:31.400]  will get triggered. So we've not lowered the quality of any of our products. I mean, some of them

[1:47:06.200 --> 1:47:27.160]  So doing some internet research here, we were trying to figure out how long do demons live?
[1:47:28.440 --> 1:47:34.760]  So we plugged that on into a search engine here. How long do demons live? We got the results.
[1:47:34.760 --> 1:47:41.880]  Apparently, demons live for 1500 years. And so just to figure out what we're in store for,
[1:47:41.880 --> 1:47:50.680]  we tried to figure out how old is Nancy Pelosi? Only 80 years old. Oh, no. Oh, it's too bad.
[1:47:51.960 --> 1:48:02.440]  It's a long time. So here is Pelosi talking about build back better and how the climate
[1:48:02.440 --> 1:48:12.920]  tyranny is on the horizon. The build back better is three baskets. It's climate,
[1:48:12.920 --> 1:48:20.040]  which we spent some time talking about already, health, job security, and moral responsibility.
[1:48:20.840 --> 1:48:27.480]  It's healthcare, the issues that relate to the Affordable Care Act, Medicare and Medicaid,
[1:48:27.480 --> 1:48:35.800]  and family care. I mentioned some of those issues already. And so whatever we do, it will be
[1:48:35.800 --> 1:48:41.160]  transformative. It will produce results. And we would are very grateful to our president for saying,
[1:48:41.160 --> 1:48:48.280]  I want to pass the bipartisan bipartisan legislation on infrastructure, but I will not
[1:48:48.280 --> 1:48:57.640]  confine my vision for the future to what can be in that bill. Hence, we need the build back better.
[1:48:57.640 --> 1:49:03.080]  We need the build back better. We need it. Let me ask you a question. What do you think life would
[1:49:03.080 --> 1:49:09.080]  be like if these people just went away, just weren't in our lives anymore, weren't in government
[1:49:09.080 --> 1:49:11.880]  anymore? Do you think we'd be okay? Do you think we'd survive? Do you think we'd be all right?
[1:49:11.880 --> 1:49:18.280]  Yeah, we'd be much better off, actually. We'd be much better off. So Pelosi's been in government
[1:49:18.280 --> 1:49:23.400]  for five decades. Biden's been in government for five decades. They've been telling you they're
[1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:28.840]  going to do the same thing for five decades, and yet they haven't done it. But somehow their wealth
[1:49:28.840 --> 1:49:36.760]  has massively increased. Isn't that amazing? Oh, we're going to fix healthcare. We're going to
[1:49:36.760 --> 1:49:39.800]  fix this. We're going to fix that. We're going to do all this stuff. And they keep telling you
[1:49:39.800 --> 1:49:44.120]  that for 50 years, they've never done it. All that's only gotten worse, but their bank accounts
[1:49:44.120 --> 1:49:50.440]  sure have grown a lot. Your freedoms have been stripped away. The average American's income is
[1:49:52.200 --> 1:49:59.640]  not going up like Pelosi's and Biden's is. But they say they have the moral responsibility,
[1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:02.280]  and that's their cover. That's their guise. That's their cape.
[1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:09.240]  The moral responsibility to run your life, the moral responsibility to tell you how to live,
[1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:14.680]  the moral responsibility to tax you more, the moral responsibility to stop you from driving a car
[1:50:14.680 --> 1:50:19.480]  or getting on an airplane, the moral responsibility to stop you from having kids. It's a moral
[1:50:19.480 --> 1:50:24.200]  responsibility of Pelosi to run your life. Don't you know that? She's God. She's in charge of your
[1:50:24.200 --> 1:50:33.720]  life now. That's what she says. But Biden and Pelosi can have enormous wealth growth while
[1:50:33.720 --> 1:50:39.320]  they work in government. And yet the IRS says they want to look at any bank account that has
[1:50:39.320 --> 1:50:46.440]  more than $600 in it, any transactions. So you do the math. By the way, I asked the crowd,
[1:50:46.440 --> 1:50:52.840]  like, hey, because the original stories were Biden hires 91,000 new IRS workers. Well,
[1:50:52.840 --> 1:50:58.840]  they did fact checks on that. Guys, it's only 87,000. It's only 87,000 new workers at the IRS.
[1:50:58.840 --> 1:51:04.600]  And then, and then Yellen says, we're going to be monitoring bank accounts with more than $600
[1:51:04.600 --> 1:51:11.160]  in it. Can you do the math on that? Why would they have to hire all of these people
[1:51:12.680 --> 1:51:14.840]  if they were just going after billionaires? I think there's like
[1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:21.960]  maybe 600 billionaires in the U.S., maybe. Guys, see how many billionaires there are
[1:51:22.680 --> 1:51:26.120]  and millionaires there are in the United States. I think there's like maybe,
[1:51:26.120 --> 1:51:29.560]  maybe 600 billionaires. Maybe I'm over exaggerating that. Let's find out here.
[1:51:32.360 --> 1:51:37.160]  Oh, the IRS is coming after people with $600. There's a lot of tax fraud and cheating that's
[1:51:37.160 --> 1:51:42.680]  going on. Yeah, I agree. Let's look at Joe Biden. Let's look at Nancy Pelosi. Let's look at Maxine
[1:51:42.680 --> 1:51:47.000]  Waters, whose husband runs a bank that got millions in bailout money. Let's look at the
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:51.640]  politicians that are making millions of dollars hand over fist while their salaries are a couple
[1:51:51.640 --> 1:52:00.520]  hundred thousand a year. So we have 614 billionaires in the United States. Okay. How many millionaires
[1:52:00.520 --> 1:52:04.200]  do we have guys? See how many millionaires there are in the United States? Obviously,
[1:52:04.200 --> 1:52:10.120]  that number is going to be a lot higher, but I still doubt that it's 87,000. Maybe it is.
[1:52:11.960 --> 1:52:17.080]  Let's see here though. How many millionaires? Oh, we have a million. Oh, wow. We have a lot of
[1:52:17.080 --> 1:52:27.480]  millionaires. Okay. So I guess though, of course, Pelosi and Biden are included in that
[1:52:28.040 --> 1:52:31.960]  18 million millionaires that we have in the United States. Hey, that's a good thing. We need rich
[1:52:31.960 --> 1:52:37.320]  people. They get the economy going. They hire people. They create jobs. They build the economy.
[1:52:38.120 --> 1:52:42.840]  I guess that's why the left hates them so much. But I don't think these 87,000 or however many
[1:52:42.840 --> 1:52:46.840]  thousand IRS workers are going to be going after Biden and Pelosi. I don't think they're going to
[1:52:46.840 --> 1:52:51.800]  be going after the billionaires either because they're in bed with them. The government, that is.
[1:52:53.080 --> 1:52:58.600]  They're all tax exempt anyway. And it's funny because they say, oh, the rich don't pay their fair
[1:52:58.600 --> 1:53:05.160]  share of taxes. And it's all the leftist. It's the wealthy leftist that are tax exempt. In fact,
[1:53:05.160 --> 1:53:11.320]  guys, wasn't it Google that didn't pay a dime in taxes like two years ago or something? So they
[1:53:11.320 --> 1:53:14.760]  say, oh, we're going to go against the millionaires and the billionaires. But then as soon as the
[1:53:14.760 --> 1:53:21.720]  millionaires and billionaires become public Democrats and liberals, all of a sudden they don't
[1:53:21.720 --> 1:53:28.680]  pay taxes. And of course, they don't get the scrutiny of the liberal left either. They're
[1:53:28.680 --> 1:53:35.240]  just going to come after you. So what do you think the Silicon Valley avoids over 100 billion in
[1:53:35.240 --> 1:53:41.080]  taxes over the last decade? Yeah, no kidding. And you really think the new IRS is going to go after
[1:53:41.080 --> 1:53:46.440]  them? Of course not. They're going after you. They don't like that you made a couple thousand
[1:53:46.440 --> 1:53:52.200]  dollars in cryptocurrency. They don't like that you're using Venmo to transfer funds back and
[1:53:52.200 --> 1:53:56.760]  forth or some other cash app. They don't like that. They want to get involved in that. They got
[1:53:56.760 --> 1:54:03.000]  to get their cut. It's kind of like here in Texas. And it's probably the same way around the country,
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  I would imagine. Let's say I have a car and I want to give my car to somebody else, whether it be a
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:19.880]  family member or a friend or whoever, I want to give them this vehicle. Okay. Well, let's say the
[1:54:19.880 --> 1:54:24.840]  government values the car at $25,000. Well, I just want to give them the car. I'm going to gift them
[1:54:24.840 --> 1:54:29.560]  the car. And there's all sorts of legal documents you can you can you have to fill to gift a car.
[1:54:29.560 --> 1:54:33.320]  You can't even just give somebody a car. The government's got to be involved in that too. And
[1:54:33.320 --> 1:54:39.400]  then they come down and they have the government appraise the car's value and then you have to
[1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:47.480]  pay a tax on a $0 transfer. I give somebody a car. They have to pay a tax on the car.
[1:54:49.960 --> 1:54:54.600]  So the government is now involved in gift giving. Same thing with the estate tax that I think Trump
[1:54:54.600 --> 1:54:59.400]  ended. I don't think it's been brought back, but it's like, you die, you leave land to your kid,
[1:55:00.280 --> 1:55:03.080]  you leave an inheritance to your kid, the government takes money out of that.
[1:55:04.120 --> 1:55:09.720]  That is ludicrous. That is ridiculous. And now they want even more access to your finances,
[1:55:09.720 --> 1:55:15.480]  more access to your bank account, more access to your life, so they can take more of your money.
[1:55:16.680 --> 1:55:21.560]  And this just goes along with the precedent that's being set with the global government COVID
[1:55:21.560 --> 1:55:26.120]  tyranny that the government runs your life. It's normal for the government to be in your pocket.
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:29.960]  It's normal for the government to be in your pants. It's normal for the government to be in
[1:55:29.960 --> 1:55:35.400]  your body. It's normal for the government to be in your house. That's what it's all about.
[1:55:35.400 --> 1:55:39.000]  Don't you know? That's the life we want to live. That's the planet we're building.
[1:55:42.200 --> 1:55:46.920]  I don't know. I feel like the government shouldn't be involved in any of that.
[1:55:46.920 --> 1:55:52.680]  And I think that would be popular, but something has changed in the left.
[1:55:53.800 --> 1:55:59.000]  Something diabolical has happened to the left. Something really twisted and evil has happened
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:03.880]  to the left. They used to be for small government. They used to be against war.
[1:56:05.160 --> 1:56:09.800]  Now they're all for it. They used to be for medical freedom, my body, my choice.
[1:56:09.800 --> 1:56:19.720]  Now they're all for it. What has happened? What happened? Hmm. But guess what? They're
[1:56:19.720 --> 1:56:24.680]  going to do it. The IRS is going to find a way to harass everybody they possibly can.
[1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:29.720]  The Democrat Party is going to find a way to limit your access to resources and limit your
[1:56:29.720 --> 1:56:33.720]  access to finances and limit your access to freedom. They'll do it. They're going to find a way
[1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:41.160]  because nobody's stopping them. Nobody's stopping them. And sadly, Info Wars is like a voice in
[1:56:41.160 --> 1:56:49.880]  the wilderness, like an island out here in media. And look, I get it. People are, oh, wow, so great,
[1:56:49.880 --> 1:56:55.080]  Joe Rogan and Gupta go on the air together. And yeah, that is good, but that wasn't even a real
[1:56:55.080 --> 1:57:02.120]  debate. The left must be savaged in an intellectual debate. All of their policies, all of their
[1:57:02.120 --> 1:57:09.880]  ideologies must be savaged, annihilated in an actual intellectual political debate. But you
[1:57:09.880 --> 1:57:14.040]  notice you don't have the debate. You have a conversation with Rogan and Gupta and that
[1:57:14.040 --> 1:57:19.560]  like blows up as the big debate. It's not even a debate. There is no debate. It's the left dominating
[1:57:19.560 --> 1:57:23.480]  you with the corporate government that they run as they claim to be anti big corporations.
[1:57:24.840 --> 1:57:27.000]  So that's why you must fund Info Wars, folks.
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:35.480]  Because we don't celebrate telling the truth. We do it because it needs to be done,
[1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:42.760]  not as an as an act of look at me, but as an act of defiance against the new world order. So
[1:57:42.760 --> 1:57:48.840]  infowarstore.com, big specials, but only three days left on the big sales at infowarstore.com.
[1:57:48.840 --> 1:57:57.080]  God created each and every one of us with free will. When we look at the world system now,
[1:57:57.080 --> 1:58:01.960]  openly announcing the mark of the beast, everything that it's attempting to do is built
[1:58:01.960 --> 1:58:07.960]  around getting rid of our free will and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies,
[1:58:07.960 --> 1:58:16.600]  our very productivity, our very genetics, our very future over to them. They want control
[1:58:16.600 --> 1:58:21.080]  of procreation. They want control of the relationships between men and women. They want
[1:58:21.080 --> 1:58:27.800]  to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization. All of us were formed and
[1:58:27.800 --> 1:58:33.720]  made in God's mind and God's image and given free will and make no mistake. All of you alive today
[1:58:33.720 --> 1:58:38.840]  were created by God to be alive in this special time so that you could make the right decision
[1:58:38.840 --> 1:58:47.240]  free will and stand against evil. And then for eternity, win the great birthright prize of
[1:58:47.240 --> 1:58:55.240]  being aligned with God. Back in stock, down and out liquid sleep support. It's been out of stock
[1:58:55.240 --> 1:59:00.200]  for a while. It's one of three sleep aids we have at infowarstore.com. This one has been
[1:59:00.200 --> 1:59:05.880]  very popular. It's sold off the shelves. It's back in stock, down and out liquid sleep support.
[1:59:05.880 --> 1:59:13.640]  This is probably the strongest sleep aid that we have, I would say. Knockout, rocket rest,
[1:59:13.640 --> 1:59:18.920]  both great, comes in pill form. This is the liquid tincture and I think this is probably the most
[1:59:18.920 --> 1:59:24.680]  powerful one. Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine. This is, if you haven't done an iodine challenge
[1:59:24.680 --> 1:59:29.240]  yet, if you haven't done the iodine challenge, what are you waiting for now is the time. Super
[1:59:29.240 --> 1:59:36.040]  male and super female vitality. Living Defense Plus and the organic greens fiber caps. We have a
[1:59:36.040 --> 1:59:40.520]  limited supply of these right now, but we want to sell them all out so we can order a new batch.
[1:59:40.520 --> 1:59:45.240]  It was very popular. The organic green fiber caps, but we have all kinds of other great supplements
[1:59:45.240 --> 2:00:01.240]  that are great for so many different things. Take advantage of those. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:05.960 --> 2:00:09.880]  You know, I'm not sure where this was posted. It looks like it was some street art,
[2:00:09.880 --> 2:00:16.760]  but somebody put this on a chalkboard somewhere out on the street. I figured it was worth reading.
[2:00:16.760 --> 2:00:23.160]  I thought it was pretty well laid out. Dear globalists, we the people have reviewed your
[2:00:23.160 --> 2:00:29.240]  proposal for the Great Reset and we regret to inform you that we will have to decline at this time,
[2:00:29.240 --> 2:00:33.960]  although we did find the free trial of the New World Order very interesting. We have decided
[2:00:33.960 --> 2:00:39.800]  instead to go with the Great Awakening, your sincerely the human race. And while that is the case,
[2:00:40.360 --> 2:00:45.400]  the New World Order doesn't care what you say or think. It gets to dominate you because that's
[2:00:45.400 --> 2:00:50.520]  what Nancy Pelosi said. That's their moral. That's their moral decision. That's their moral duty is
[2:00:50.520 --> 2:00:54.520]  to run your life because they're better than you, even though they're the biggest criminals in the world.
[2:00:56.840 --> 2:01:01.960]  But I wanted to go to this clip from Bloomberg. And you know, I was actually surprised. Normally,
[2:01:01.960 --> 2:01:08.280]  this Bloomberg host is pretty centrist. She mostly just does economic stuff. And I knew she was kind
[2:01:08.280 --> 2:01:11.720]  of a liberal based off some of her coverage, but she doesn't really let it be known. Normally,
[2:01:12.280 --> 2:01:17.240]  she's pretty just neutral when she does her coverage. But boy, did she come out of the closet
[2:01:17.240 --> 2:01:25.080]  for this interview with David Sacks as she attacks relentlessly Ron DeSantis and Sacks basically won't
[2:01:25.080 --> 2:01:31.960]  have any of it. Here was the Bloomberg interview with, I think her name is, I want to say Emily
[2:01:31.960 --> 2:01:36.760]  Brown. I forget her name though. Anyway, normally pretty neutral. You wouldn't know what her politics
[2:01:36.760 --> 2:01:41.960]  were, but boy, she came out of the bag in this interview. Check it out. I do want to ask you
[2:01:41.960 --> 2:01:46.280]  about the fundraiser you're hosting for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who obviously is a very
[2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:52.440]  divisive figure. See the propaganda there? Just oh, just oh, DeSantis obviously divisive figure.
[2:01:52.440 --> 2:01:58.200]  No, no, no, you lie about Ron DeSantis. So they're never divisive. They lie, they contort,
[2:01:58.200 --> 2:02:03.960]  they demonize, they censor, but they're never divisive. Never them. They're never divisive.
[2:02:03.960 --> 2:02:08.760]  If they don't, no, no, no, no, only your divisive, only the people they disagree with are divisive,
[2:02:08.760 --> 2:02:13.560]  only the opposition to them are divisive, not them, not them imposing mandates,
[2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:18.360]  not them imposing their will, not them lying about and demonizing you. No, they're never divisive.
[2:02:18.360 --> 2:02:23.880]  It's only you. Obviously divisive, Ron DeSantis. Just putting that out there as if it's a matter
[2:02:23.880 --> 2:02:26.840]  of fact, and it's not. But here you go. Continue.
[2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:31.480]  First of all, when it comes to public health, I know that you don't necessarily agree with all of
[2:02:31.480 --> 2:02:35.000]  them, but why do you support such a divisive?
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:35.880]  No, it's not divisive.
[2:02:35.880 --> 2:02:39.800]  Especially given the global health crisis we are still facing.
[2:02:39.800 --> 2:02:43.400]  Pause it right there. So notice what she does here. Oh, it's just a matter of fact,
[2:02:43.400 --> 2:02:48.360]  DeSantis is divisive, what, because he believes in personal choice and freedom? That's divisive now?
[2:02:48.360 --> 2:02:52.280]  And then they just continue the big lie. The global pandemic we're facing, the global pandemic
[2:02:52.280 --> 2:02:55.560]  we're facing, the global pandemic we're facing, just, you know, they'll repeat the big lie over
[2:02:55.560 --> 2:02:58.280]  and over and over until they believe it, until everybody believes it, which we never will,
[2:02:58.280 --> 2:03:00.760]  because we're not stupid. But here you go.
[2:03:00.760 --> 2:03:04.280]  Apparently more divisive than, say, Gavin Newsom or someone on the other side of the spectrum.
[2:03:04.280 --> 2:03:09.720]  See, what I would argue is that words like polarizing and divisiveness, they assume a normative
[2:03:09.720 --> 2:03:15.000]  baseline in which everybody agrees, everyone in the tech industry agrees, because they all come
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:20.840]  from a certain information bubble. And anyone who deviates from that orthodoxy is perceived divisive.
[2:03:20.840 --> 2:03:22.760]  I would argue that they're-
[2:03:22.760 --> 2:03:25.480]  Pause it right there real quick too, because you notice what he just said.
[2:03:25.480 --> 2:03:29.560]  He says these people come from a bubble. Sanjay Gupta is the perfect example if you take him in
[2:03:29.560 --> 2:03:33.800]  his word. He knew nothing of Ivermectin. He knew nothing of vaccine side effects. He knew
[2:03:33.800 --> 2:03:38.040]  nothing of natural immunity. He knows none of this because he lives in a bubble or he's a liar.
[2:03:38.040 --> 2:03:40.760]  But that's what he's saying. He says these people live in a bubble. Continue.
[2:03:40.760 --> 2:03:45.640]  There's a multiplicity of views and you're not divisive just because you don't agree
[2:03:45.640 --> 2:03:47.400]  with the orthodoxy of Silicon Valley.
[2:03:50.040 --> 2:03:54.520]  So, but why DeSantis over many of the other candidates who you could host fundraisers for?
[2:03:54.520 --> 2:03:58.920]  I mean, I know you're bullish on Florida, but DeSantis and their Suarez, who was actually
[2:03:58.920 --> 2:04:02.200]  on the show earlier this hour, are on different ends of the spectrum.
[2:04:02.920 --> 2:04:07.800]  I've donated to Suarez too, but I like both of them. I like Suarez because
[2:04:07.800 --> 2:04:11.160]  he's been extremely welcoming towards the tech ecosystem in Miami. I think that's
[2:04:11.160 --> 2:04:15.000]  a smart strategy. I don't get why the politicians in San Francisco don't do that.
[2:04:15.960 --> 2:04:20.440]  I mean, they're killing the golden goose. In terms of why I like DeSantis, he was the first
[2:04:20.440 --> 2:04:25.800]  governor to stop these insane lockdowns. And, you know, he found the right policy on lockdowns,
[2:04:25.800 --> 2:04:30.120]  which was to stop them. And he did it despite an extremely hostile media. So, I respect that.
[2:04:30.120 --> 2:04:35.560]  When somebody takes the right position on an issue despite the hostility of the media,
[2:04:35.560 --> 2:04:37.800]  that's something I can really respect. That's why I support it.
[2:05:06.280 --> 2:05:10.040]  Could you imagine even going into the grocery store? Do you think they would let you in?
[2:05:10.040 --> 2:05:13.560]  Do you think they would be following you in the aisles to make sure that you weren't going to be
[2:05:13.560 --> 2:05:19.880]  shoplifting? Could you imagine going up to a gas station and going inside the little
[2:05:19.880 --> 2:05:24.600]  mini-mart to pay for your gas with a bandana on? How far do you think that would get you?
[2:05:24.600 --> 2:05:29.240]  Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school with a shield that looks like a space
[2:05:29.240 --> 2:05:37.880]  alien? Those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction.
[2:05:59.880 --> 2:06:17.880]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[2:06:17.880 --> 2:06:25.720]  Thank you. Alex Andrew Stein.
[2:06:30.120 --> 2:06:32.600]  Mr. Stein. Yes.
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:40.600]  You addressed City Council on September 2, 2001.
[2:06:40.600 --> 2:06:47.160]  No, that's incorrect. That's incorrect. That's not what you're saying.
[2:06:47.160 --> 2:06:49.960]  Therefore, you're not eligible to speak under our City Council.
[2:06:49.960 --> 2:06:54.840]  No, that's not me. Ladies and gentlemen of the City Council, I'm here for a lot of reasons,
[2:06:54.840 --> 2:06:57.640]  so let me get started. Not the governor, not Donald Trump.
[2:06:57.640 --> 2:07:13.480]  What are you talking about? Please state your final word.
[2:07:15.240 --> 2:07:18.920]  The City Secretary said this gentleman has spoken before. He's outside of our rules.
[2:07:20.360 --> 2:07:25.720]  So that is my guest, or it might be my guest. I'm not really sure. This is a,
[2:07:25.720 --> 2:07:30.120]  I believe, a gender-fluid individual here, so I got to make sure to handle this correctly.
[2:07:31.400 --> 2:07:35.480]  Alex Stein is my guest. I think we do have Alex Stein with us today,
[2:07:36.360 --> 2:07:44.040]  who's also spoken at City Council, not Alexandria Stein. That is his other gender identity.
[2:07:45.880 --> 2:07:52.680]  Alex, let me just start it off with this. Why is it that your right to be gender-fluid is being
[2:07:52.680 --> 2:07:58.360]  denied, but if you were somebody else, I have a feeling that that would be considered a hate crime
[2:07:58.360 --> 2:08:01.960]  to deny Alexandria the right to speak that day. How do you make sense of this?
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:07.240]  Well, this is how it works, is I lost my genitalia in a way-lifting accident,
[2:08:07.240 --> 2:08:13.000]  so I was encouraged to get the genitalia assigned to surgery in 80. And I did that under the guys
[2:08:13.000 --> 2:08:17.400]  that I thought it would, you know, help me out with job opportunities with speaking at City
[2:08:17.400 --> 2:08:23.000]  Council. But unfortunately, living a life as a trans person, Owen, is not easy. So for me,
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:27.720]  I think I'd rather just, I kind of, you know, I like to put on the suit and remember a time back
[2:08:27.720 --> 2:08:34.840]  when I still had my genitalia as a man. So you're now a victim, you are now a victim of transphobia?
[2:08:35.640 --> 2:08:39.960]  They're 100%. And that's the problem is, you know, we live in a society where they're all
[2:08:39.960 --> 2:08:44.520]  hypocrites. Everybody's a hypocrite. Everybody wants to say they're inclusive. They're not,
[2:08:44.520 --> 2:08:49.000]  but we know, Owen, we can sit here, we can joke around all day about transphobia, but this is
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:54.200]  what I want to say to you. I'm such a fan of you. But what happened to you with January 6th is the
[2:08:54.200 --> 2:08:59.960]  biggest travesty in this entire country. The fact that they weaponized our police force in order to
[2:08:59.960 --> 2:09:05.640]  be a domestic terrorist, like you're a domestic terrorist, like you're some Islamic terrorist,
[2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:10.680]  is the biggest travesty in the entire world. And I feel really sick that Donald Trump didn't bail
[2:09:10.680 --> 2:09:14.440]  you out or bail out the other people they got arrested. So I just want to say as a fan of yours,
[2:09:14.440 --> 2:09:17.640]  thank you because you're the biggest, you're one of the biggest patriots I know. And for them to
[2:09:17.640 --> 2:09:23.640]  ever call you a terrorist is one of the most disgusting and incorrect labels, more incorrect
[2:09:23.640 --> 2:09:28.200]  than when they call me a man when I'm really a woman. So that is the worst label. Well,
[2:09:28.200 --> 2:09:34.280]  let's get serious here for a second. I appreciate those kind words. And I actually was first introduced
[2:09:34.280 --> 2:09:40.440]  to you with your last visit to city council when you broke down into hysteria about the abortion
[2:09:40.440 --> 2:09:43.880]  thing, which was just hilarious. That's how I was introduced to you. Your work is great too. But
[2:09:43.880 --> 2:09:48.440]  I will just say this. I am in court tomorrow. It's a big day. I know a lot of people are praying for
[2:09:48.440 --> 2:09:52.280]  me. I'm not going to go much further into that. But just know I am in court for that tomorrow.
[2:09:52.840 --> 2:09:56.920]  And unfortunately, Trump is no longer in the office. So there's not much he can do. He is
[2:09:56.920 --> 2:10:01.240]  speaking out about these political prisoners now. But if people want to continue to pray for me,
[2:10:01.240 --> 2:10:05.800]  that means everything. Big day in court tomorrow, I will have an update tomorrow afternoon. But
[2:10:05.800 --> 2:10:13.560]  Alex, let's get serious here because here's the thing. I've always I've often wondered when you're
[2:10:13.560 --> 2:10:19.000]  going to start seeing people as a political statement, you know, say, okay, I'm going to be
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:22.600]  transgender and I'm going to be a golfer or I'm going to be transgender and I'm going to be a basketball
[2:10:22.600 --> 2:10:28.520]  player or I'm going to be a fighter, just to prove how ridiculous the whole thing is. And we've seen
[2:10:28.520 --> 2:10:34.440]  men fight women and crack their skulls and fights. And we've seen men play handball against women
[2:10:34.440 --> 2:10:39.080]  and dominate and basketball and all this stuff. But it seems like you're only allowed to do it
[2:10:39.640 --> 2:10:43.880]  if you have if it's like they do somehow they do like a background check, you're only allowed to
[2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:48.280]  do that if you're a good progressive liberal. But if you're not and you try to do it, all of a
[2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:52.120]  sudden you're bad. Caitlyn gender may be the wrong example. But I think the treatment of you
[2:10:52.120 --> 2:10:59.160]  is the perfect example. Where is the where is the LGBTQIA plus nine or 62 tortoise dolphin?
[2:10:59.160 --> 2:11:04.680]  Where are they coming to protect you from the discrimination you faced? I'm begging for Justin
[2:11:04.680 --> 2:11:09.800]  Trudeau to swoop in and save me. I mean, Justin Trudeau is a hero that I need. He's trying to be,
[2:11:09.800 --> 2:11:19.080]  you know, he loves two LGBTQIAs plus and I agree with that. I love two LGBTQQQQQ plus as well.
[2:11:19.080 --> 2:11:22.840]  So I'm just saying it just sucks that we live in this world where our leaders are not standing up
[2:11:22.840 --> 2:11:28.040]  for us. You know that I mean, you know, we live under constant tyranny and right now we're under
[2:11:28.040 --> 2:11:32.520]  literal medical tyranny. And your boss Alex Jones has been calling that out for a long time. It's
[2:11:32.520 --> 2:11:36.520]  just soft. I can't I don't want to come on here and be, you know, some baby back page and say,
[2:11:36.520 --> 2:11:41.080]  you know, be a nihilist, say that the world is a terrible place. But unfortunately, what is
[2:11:41.080 --> 2:11:45.480]  happening right now that these people getting this vaccine and if you die within two weeks of it,
[2:11:45.480 --> 2:11:51.240]  they're not considered a unvaccinated death. We're just in the biggest nightmare possible.
[2:11:51.240 --> 2:11:56.200]  For now, I told my mom she has a cough. I'm scared to make her go to the hospital. I tell my mom,
[2:11:56.200 --> 2:12:00.440]  don't go to the hospital. Stay at home. Can you believe you live in a nightmare now where I would
[2:12:00.440 --> 2:12:05.160]  tell my sick mother to stay away from a doctor because every single doctor is bought and sold
[2:12:05.160 --> 2:12:09.240]  by a multinational corporation and that they don't even care. They have no soul. That's the
[2:12:09.240 --> 2:12:13.160]  problem with America is that we're run by multinational corporations. And these multinational
[2:12:13.160 --> 2:12:17.000]  corporations have a globalist viewpoints. They don't care about America. That's why they want
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:21.720]  all the Haitians in the world up here. That's why they want to destabilize the nuclear family and
[2:12:21.720 --> 2:12:26.280]  make everything transgender because this is all part of the globalization of the world that they
[2:12:26.280 --> 2:12:32.120]  have more control. And sadly, until we're stopped being run by Pfizer and Moderna, we're going to
[2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:36.360]  live in a constant nightmare. You know that. I know that. It's just really sad. You know, that's
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:40.280]  it exactly though. That's why it's all about we the people or the power of the people because people
[2:12:40.280 --> 2:12:45.080]  have a soul. Or I guess, you know, maybe most people, I don't know. But people, the idea is that
[2:12:45.080 --> 2:12:50.280]  people have a soul. So there's that human touch. Whereas government bodies and corporations don't
[2:12:50.280 --> 2:12:55.160]  have a soul. There is no human touch. So railroading over humans, destroying people's lives,
[2:12:55.160 --> 2:13:00.360]  they just have no, they have no problem with that. But why is it, is that why you kind of chose to do
[2:13:00.360 --> 2:13:06.840]  more of a humorous kind of approach to all this madness because it's just so crazy that humor is
[2:13:06.840 --> 2:13:11.960]  the only way you, you know, try to get, get a word in? Dude, look at your boss, Alex Jones, for
[2:13:11.960 --> 2:13:15.400]  what you want to say about Alex Jones, Donald Trump is the greatest comedian in the world.
[2:13:15.400 --> 2:13:19.560]  Alex Jones is a number two comedian in the world. I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that
[2:13:19.560 --> 2:13:23.240]  facetiously. He's funnier than Howard Stern. He's funnier than Jimmy Kimmel because you have
[2:13:23.240 --> 2:13:26.920]  to be funny because that's the only way you break through the trauma-based mind control.
[2:13:26.920 --> 2:13:31.880]  You turn on CNN. There's a death scroller. How many people have died? There's an age of death.
[2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:35.560]  If you're a normal person, plugged into the matrix and you're constantly under trauma-based
[2:13:35.560 --> 2:13:40.440]  mind control, the only way to break through that, that, you know, thick coated candy,
[2:13:40.440 --> 2:13:47.000]  M&M peanut shell of your brain is with humor because like I said, the trauma-based mind control
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:51.400]  has everyone under hypnosis. And the only way to break out of it is like when I'm hitting
[2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:56.040]  a tissue to snap your fingers or make you laugh. You literally have to do that because that's the
[2:13:56.040 --> 2:14:00.200]  only way to get through to these people because what the problem is, we are stuck. We get addicted
[2:14:00.200 --> 2:14:04.680]  to the cortisol release. So we read the ticker. We see somebody dies. And what that does is that,
[2:14:04.680 --> 2:14:09.560]  you know, creates this serotonous non serotonous cortisol release that we get addicted to. So
[2:14:09.560 --> 2:14:14.840]  it's sad. So without the humor, I try to be serious. I try to, you know, try to wake people up.
[2:14:14.840 --> 2:14:17.720]  But this is the problem. I always make this point. We make this point real quick.
[2:14:17.720 --> 2:14:21.240]  A&W hamburgers or A&W root beer, they try to get the hamburger business. Let me tell
[2:14:21.240 --> 2:14:26.040]  this story real quick. They did a market survey, worldwide survey. They wanted to compete with
[2:14:26.040 --> 2:14:29.880]  McDonald's. This is in the 80s. You can look this up. And what they did is they asked individuals
[2:14:29.880 --> 2:14:36.680]  what they thought was a better value, the quarter pounder burger or $4.99 or the third pounder burger
[2:14:36.680 --> 2:14:41.400]  for $4.79. And overwhelmingly, people picked the quarter pounder burger as a better value
[2:14:41.400 --> 2:14:45.400]  because they didn't realize that a full pound is less than a third of a pound. So we're dealing
[2:14:45.400 --> 2:14:49.560]  with people that don't have a full deck of cards. They can't do a simple fraction. So that's the
[2:14:49.560 --> 2:14:53.080]  majority of people that we're dealing with. And that's why the only way to get through to these
[2:14:53.080 --> 2:14:57.480]  black and the better word, imbeciles, is with humor, because they're using trauma-based mind
[2:14:57.480 --> 2:15:04.040]  control. So it's either or anything in the middle gets ignored. I agree with what we're dealing
[2:15:04.040 --> 2:15:10.040]  with here. And I think again, to me, it just exposes how, see, here's what it is. You're
[2:15:10.040 --> 2:15:14.680]  actually a smart guy, okay? You've probably never been diagnosed with a mental disorder. You're
[2:15:14.680 --> 2:15:20.600]  a smart guy, probably a high IQ, well-studied. But see, the liberal leftist that pretends to be a man
[2:15:20.600 --> 2:15:25.960]  or pretends to be a woman or whatever that they do, we have already subconsciously accepted that
[2:15:25.960 --> 2:15:31.240]  they have a mental disorder. It's like you don't hit Arnie from Gilbert Grape. So we let them behave
[2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:35.320]  like clowns. We let them do all the craziness because we recognize that they have a mental
[2:15:35.320 --> 2:15:40.920]  disorder. But when you do it, oh, that's not allowed. You're not allowed to do it because
[2:15:40.920 --> 2:15:46.040]  you're actually somebody that has a high IQ and is actually smart and we can recognize that and we
[2:15:46.040 --> 2:15:52.920]  can vibe with that frequency. So you're not allowed to be Alexandria. Only somebody that's a
[2:15:52.920 --> 2:15:57.960]  progressive liberal mental disorder is allowed to be Alexandria and then Alex the next day. Not you,
[2:15:57.960 --> 2:16:07.320]  don't you know that? Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or
[2:16:07.320 --> 2:16:12.760]  in person, it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're
[2:16:12.760 --> 2:16:18.360]  angry. And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've
[2:16:18.360 --> 2:16:23.560]  got. Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then

[2:16:59.960 --> 2:17:03.560]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of
[2:17:03.560 --> 2:17:09.400]  off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year. Here's why.
[2:17:09.400 --> 2:17:15.000]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock. These emergency backup systems
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:19.960]  provide life-saving backup power when you need it most. And unlike gas generators,
[2:17:19.960 --> 2:17:25.880]  solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes and produce an endless supply of free
[2:17:25.880 --> 2:17:31.080]  electricity from the sun. Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues or just
[2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:35.560]  getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:17:36.120 --> 2:17:42.200]  Even better, all this week radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too.

[2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:05.960]  A little more than 20 years ago, Japanese scientists discovered and were able to isolate
[2:18:05.960 --> 2:18:12.760]  a compound that is naturally in nature and in foods we eat, but in very, very low amounts.
[2:18:12.760 --> 2:18:19.160]  It's called PQQ or BiopQQ. When you have the organic form of it, it does amazing things.
[2:18:19.160 --> 2:18:23.160]  It actually makes your telomeres last longer. It doesn't make them grow,
[2:18:23.160 --> 2:18:27.560]  but makes them last longer in the space of the same thing. So it's as close to the fountain of
[2:18:27.560 --> 2:18:33.320]  youth as you're going to get. Well, DNA Force Plus has been sold out for six months. It's back in
[2:18:33.320 --> 2:18:39.960]  stock, the highest quality PQQ, CoQ10 and so much more. This entire formula is about cleaning out
[2:18:39.960 --> 2:18:46.520]  your cells and helping your body last longer. And that is so incredibly important. We have it at 40%
[2:18:46.520 --> 2:18:51.640]  off despite the effects that's been sold out for six months at infowarstore.com. It's amazing.

[2:19:00.680 --> 2:19:05.880]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between
[2:19:05.880 --> 2:19:11.800]  free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other who are literally
[2:19:11.800 --> 2:19:16.840]  trying to create a post-human world. From the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered
[2:19:16.840 --> 2:19:22.360]  by the Brexit in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[2:19:22.360 --> 2:19:26.520]  That's why they launched their great recess. And their program after collapsing us
[2:19:27.240 --> 2:19:34.200]  have built back better. This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the
[2:19:34.200 --> 2:19:39.160]  world economy. And because they couldn't take our guns, and because we wouldn't bow, because the left,
[2:19:39.720 --> 2:19:45.160]  which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win, they released a biological
[2:19:45.160 --> 2:19:51.400]  weapon on us. Now we know two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago. It's that simple.
[2:19:51.400 --> 2:19:55.320]  They can't maybe it's because of our free speech and our guns. So the global corporate
[2:19:55.320 --> 2:20:05.880]  combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history. Expose this paradigm and we win.
[2:20:05.880 --> 2:20:14.440]  So
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:26.440]  Alex Stein is with us from his conspiracy castle. That's where you can find him on YouTube,
[2:20:26.440 --> 2:20:32.600]  conspiracy castle. A lot of good content there. And I want to know if Alex agrees
[2:20:32.600 --> 2:20:40.600]  with my analysis of the last segment. He's now brought his cat into the into the camera here.
[2:20:41.240 --> 2:20:46.200]  I'm not sure. Let me tell you something. I have toxoplasmosis from dealing with a fecal matter.
[2:20:46.200 --> 2:20:51.000]  It's a parasite that goes into the brain. And it turns you into a cat. So here at the castle,
[2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:54.200]  we have plenty of cats. So you know, this is I don't get to come on infowars all the time.
[2:20:54.200 --> 2:20:58.280]  So Kyle, say hi. Okay, back to where we're saying sorry, the cat was interrupting. I apologize on
[2:20:58.280 --> 2:21:02.360]  that. Well, that's okay. We got to be open minded. The animals have opinions too. You know,
[2:21:02.360 --> 2:21:06.440]  climate change affects them too. It probably needs a COVID vaccine. But how do you?
[2:21:07.400 --> 2:21:11.240]  Oh, and let's talk about that climate change. That's the new thing. This is the problem. Okay.
[2:21:11.240 --> 2:21:15.960]  No, wait, no, you hold it right there. I want you to respond. I want you to respond to my question.
[2:21:16.840 --> 2:21:24.680]  Because why is it that you can't go speak as Alexandria at a city council, you get you get
[2:21:24.680 --> 2:21:29.320]  arrested and kicked out of the city council. Why isn't that why isn't that a lot? Why isn't that a
[2:21:29.320 --> 2:21:34.760]  hate crime against the LGBTQIA plus community? Where where is the transgender community? Where
[2:21:34.760 --> 2:21:39.000]  is the gender fluid gender conformity community? Why aren't they coming to your defense? Seriously,
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  why do you think that is? Because the rules don't apply to me because I don't follow the New World
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:49.960]  Order's agenda. And that's the thing is they're all about agendas. It's like AOC was casted.
[2:21:49.960 --> 2:21:53.000]  You know, these people are literally the people that they stand up for have to go through a
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:58.280]  casting process similar to a reality TV show. So any elected official is bought and sold. I now
[2:21:58.280 --> 2:22:01.640]  got all this cat hair on me is bought and sold like toilet paper by these political action
[2:22:01.640 --> 2:22:06.360]  committee. So no committee will stand up for me and my trans rights because I don't have the same
[2:22:06.360 --> 2:22:11.160]  viewpoints as a normal trans person would because I don't want to further the trans agenda because
[2:22:11.160 --> 2:22:15.720]  my trans was an accident and it wasn't by choice. So that's why I think I'm a little different than
[2:22:15.720 --> 2:22:19.640]  a like me in the trans community as much. Oh, and that's, that's exactly it. So it's really
[2:22:19.640 --> 2:22:25.480]  not even about the trans community or transgendered individuals. It's always about the political agenda.
[2:22:25.480 --> 2:22:32.040]  It always will be. It always has been. And so that is why you aren't allowed to speak as Alexandria.
[2:22:32.040 --> 2:22:36.280]  But if you were a good leftist, progressive New World Order agent, then you would be,
[2:22:36.280 --> 2:22:40.120]  you'd be allowed to speak. And if they kicked you out, it'd be a national crime and a hate crime.
[2:22:40.120 --> 2:22:44.120]  And there'd be police investigating the entire thing. But because you're Alex Stein,
[2:22:44.120 --> 2:22:49.720]  you're not allowed to have the rights of the trans community. You're not allowed to have those rights.
[2:22:49.720 --> 2:22:53.480]  And we know the hypocrisy is real, but that's just what we live on. I mean, that's the,
[2:22:54.040 --> 2:22:59.480]  I mean, we live in a world of complete hypocrites. So, you know, like, this is not surprising,
[2:22:59.480 --> 2:23:03.720]  but this is what this is good. This is going to motivate me to troll them so much harder. Oh,
[2:23:03.720 --> 2:23:07.880]  and I'm going to go at them so much harder. Mayor Johnson and them, I am going to, I mean,
[2:23:07.880 --> 2:23:14.040]  literally I'm going to bullhorn him, you know, and in Alex Jones style, you know, and he's doing the
[2:23:14.040 --> 2:23:17.960]  BMW marathon is coming up soon. He's going to speak at that. So I'm going to go with the bullhorn
[2:23:17.960 --> 2:23:22.280]  and totally just annihilate him. So I'm actually happy. What it does is just motivates me. It's
[2:23:22.280 --> 2:23:26.840]  like you and you got in trouble for dropping the Trump one banner at the, at the ranger stadium.
[2:23:26.840 --> 2:23:30.680]  You know what I mean? It sucks getting these police involved, but it kind of motivates you to do
[2:23:30.680 --> 2:23:36.280]  it some more. I hate to be, this is why I hate to be an agent of chaos. But sadly, you kind of
[2:23:36.280 --> 2:23:40.440]  have to be a little bit because if you don't stir things up, it's just people are just going to go
[2:23:40.440 --> 2:23:44.040]  with the status quo and they're going to continue to be political correct. And we're just going to
[2:23:44.040 --> 2:23:48.680]  be on a slow moving train to hell. And I think that's currently the direction that we're heading.
[2:23:48.680 --> 2:23:52.280]  Well, it's like a fight, you know, it's like any fighter that gets in a fight, you get punched,
[2:23:52.280 --> 2:23:56.040]  you want to punch back. And so that's what's going on, I think with your situation. But I think
[2:23:56.040 --> 2:24:01.560]  it's funny because apparently, and we'll move on to the climate after this, but I might as well
[2:24:01.560 --> 2:24:09.560]  bring this up right now. So there's a transgender police officer in the UK. And there is now a
[2:24:09.560 --> 2:24:14.680]  counterterrorism probe that has been launched after the trans police officer gets two million
[2:24:14.680 --> 2:24:20.280]  hate comments online. So they've launched a counterterrorism, a terrorism probe,
[2:24:20.280 --> 2:24:25.960]  because a transgender police officer was being made fun of. But again, where's the probe? Where's
[2:24:25.960 --> 2:24:32.520]  the investigation into Alexandria Stein, having her rights denied to speak in front of city council?
[2:24:32.520 --> 2:24:36.360]  I just, I see the two tiered justice system continuing and now you're a victim.
[2:24:37.400 --> 2:24:41.320]  Well, you know, the thing is in most of the times when there are, you know, hate, hate,
[2:24:41.880 --> 2:24:44.440]  look at that. I would actually, I wouldn't mind if she.
[2:24:44.440 --> 2:24:51.720]  Hi, I'm Officer Mrs. Robinson. And you know, well, I don't want to mislabel her. You know,
[2:24:51.720 --> 2:24:57.320]  she did that so she can be, you know, the champion of the women's inner, inner mural police team.
[2:24:57.320 --> 2:25:00.680]  I mean, she's probably some sort of awesome basketball player. You know what I mean? I'm
[2:25:00.680 --> 2:25:05.320]  going to get a phone call now. I'm going to get a phone call now. I'm now a part of the probe
[2:25:05.320 --> 2:25:10.200]  because I put that image on screen. You're right though. She's now on the women's police force soft
[2:25:10.200 --> 2:25:16.440]  ball team, smashing dingers left and right. Just MVP. Just, you know, the bell of the ball,
[2:25:16.440 --> 2:25:20.920]  literally, you know, wearing a dress after, but you know, if you look at this whole, you know,
[2:25:20.920 --> 2:25:25.640]  the transgender agenda, and this is the one thing I believe this sounds terrible, but it is based
[2:25:25.640 --> 2:25:30.440]  in a satanic origin of Baphomet. When you see Baphomet, it has the breasts and then has like
[2:25:30.440 --> 2:25:35.400]  the male abs. So we like to joke about this, but if you actually ask a gay person, you know,
[2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:39.880]  I have gay family members. So they say the amount of people that are actually transitioning that
[2:25:39.880 --> 2:25:46.200]  are either doing the gender reassignment or doing the puberty blockers from 1990 to now in the past
[2:25:46.200 --> 2:25:52.200]  30 years is 10,000 percent of what it was in the years before. So what people don't realize is this
[2:25:52.200 --> 2:25:56.200]  is all social engineering. The acceptance. Oh, you should be free. You should be yourself. Yes,
[2:25:56.200 --> 2:26:00.760]  you should be yourself. And yes, you can. You should be eccentric. I'm eccentric. But the idea
[2:26:00.760 --> 2:26:04.440]  of putting an 11 year old on puberty blockers and then at 17 when they change their mind,
[2:26:04.440 --> 2:26:08.680]  they still have the genitals of an 11 year old. So these people are sick. These parents want
[2:26:08.680 --> 2:26:14.040]  clout. We live in a world of social media where you can have a trans baby and get 10,000 likes
[2:26:14.040 --> 2:26:18.120]  on tiktok. And there are people sick enough to do it because those are the same people that do
[2:26:18.120 --> 2:26:22.120]  the munchausen by proxy or the same people that do, you know, what orders? I forget what is this
[2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:25.240]  the syndrome where you make your kids sick. But that's literally what they do when you,
[2:26:25.240 --> 2:26:29.400]  when you, you know, make your kid trans, you're literally making your kids sick. And that is
[2:26:29.400 --> 2:26:35.080]  what these people are doing because it has origins in absolute in paganism, Satanism. And
[2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:39.000]  you're right. They do get clout from it. That's absolutely correct. So let me do this. I want
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:42.760]  to roll this ad and I want to get your response to this ad. We'll talk climate when we come back
[2:26:42.760 --> 2:26:46.760]  on the other side, but I'm going to roll this ad. I'm not going to tell you what this is an ad for,
[2:26:46.760 --> 2:26:49.880]  but I want you to watch this out. I want the audience to watch this. I want you to watch
[2:26:49.880 --> 2:26:54.760]  this ad as you're seeing it think, what is this an advertisement from? Or what is this an advertisement
[2:26:54.760 --> 2:27:00.520]  for? And it may surprise you when you find out. So here's a new advertisement. See if you can
[2:27:00.520 --> 2:27:13.400]  figure out what it's for as we play it. Clip 10.
[2:28:01.240 --> 2:28:11.400]  Let me tell you something. That is the most well made transgender. Basically,
[2:28:11.960 --> 2:28:16.040]  sorry, I don't know how I got a donation. Why I'm not even live right now. I don't know how that
[2:28:16.040 --> 2:28:22.120]  came through. But that my response to that is that's the most well made transgender porn that
[2:28:22.120 --> 2:28:27.000]  I've ever seen without being nude. And the reason they could wrong, that is a home insurance ad.
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:31.880]  Oh, that's not an ad for pornography. Oh, I thought that was literally a home insurance ad
[2:28:31.880 --> 2:28:37.800]  with a with a what appears to be a crossdressing, I guess, future transgender male pretending to
[2:28:37.800 --> 2:28:42.360]  be a girl. That's an insurance ad. Well, this is the problem with that. If they could have done
[2:28:42.360 --> 2:28:45.240]  that with just a normal girl, it would have been a great commercial. They could have done a young
[2:28:45.240 --> 2:28:49.720]  girl and what has been, you know, the same thing is that these artists, they think it's so funny
[2:28:49.720 --> 2:28:53.880]  and so cute to mock this, this little kid and this little boy, he might not have been, you know,
[2:28:53.880 --> 2:28:57.960]  he's probably so happy. Hey, let life happen. Don't you know, boys just all boys want to be
[2:28:57.960 --> 2:29:01.560]  girls. Just let life happen. Alex, you're concerned about the power grid and want to
[2:29:01.560 --> 2:29:07.000]  generate your own supply of off grid electricity. This will be the most important message you'll
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:13.240]  hear this year. Here's why we now have a small number of solar generators back in stock. These
[2:29:13.240 --> 2:29:18.520]  emergency backup systems provide a life saving backup power when you need it most. And unlike
[2:29:18.520 --> 2:29:25.000]  gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes and produce an endless supply
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:30.120]  of free electricity from the sun. Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues,
[2:29:30.120 --> 2:29:35.160]  or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:29:35.720 --> 2:29:41.800]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off the grid bonuses too.
[2:29:41.800 --> 2:29:47.640]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:29:47.640 --> 2:29:52.040]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat,
[2:29:52.040 --> 2:30:18.920]  milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage. Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[2:30:22.760 --> 2:30:27.720]  Your body will fall apart even faster. And with so many chemicals in the food and water and so
[2:30:27.720 --> 2:30:31.720]  much agitation in the culture and life, it's hard to settle down. It's hard to relax. Well,
[2:30:31.720 --> 2:30:36.920]  let me tell you something right now. Down and out is an incredibly strong natural compound.
[2:30:36.920 --> 2:30:42.200]  It's got over eight compounds in it that will give you deep, pure, clean sleep. And it's such a game
[2:30:42.200 --> 2:30:46.920]  changer. So with all the vitamins and minerals, the last big ingredient is down and out available
[2:30:46.920 --> 2:30:53.080]  again at m4worshore.com for 50% off. And you know what? I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it
[2:30:53.080 --> 2:30:57.560]  sells out, even though we've already sold out a half of it in just the last month. And we probably
[2:30:57.560 --> 2:31:07.320]  aren't going to have more for about five months. What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[2:31:07.320 --> 2:31:14.360]  Patreon.com.
[2:31:37.320 --> 2:32:06.680]  I want to be very clear, the fact that Info Wars is having trouble funding itself is
[2:32:06.680 --> 2:32:11.800]  not the fault of our amazing listeners and supporters. It is the fault of the globalists.
[2:32:12.440 --> 2:32:16.280]  When we can get enough of our great supplements and other products in, we're able to sell enough
[2:32:16.280 --> 2:32:20.840]  of it to stay on air and, quite frankly, even expand in the face of the new world war. But
[2:32:20.840 --> 2:32:25.240]  because of the supply chain breakdowns that were very easy to predict from the global lockdowns
[2:32:25.240 --> 2:32:29.480]  were designed to do that, we have had real problems getting our best selling products in.
[2:32:29.480 --> 2:32:33.800]  Some of them take up to 10 months to get in. We've had to discontinue some of our products
[2:32:33.800 --> 2:32:39.400]  because we just can't get the ingredients anymore. It's pretty scary stuff. So please,
[2:32:39.400 --> 2:32:43.320]  take advantage of sales we're running for one week only. There's only one week left
[2:32:43.320 --> 2:32:49.960]  from October 11th for 7 days. Kicks off October 11th on things like DNA Force Plus at 40% off,
[2:32:49.960 --> 2:32:57.240]  Winter Sun at 50% off, Ultra 12 at 50% off, and more. At infowarstore.com, one week left,
[2:32:57.240 --> 2:33:06.840]  check out these incredible deals. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:06.840 --> 2:33:25.640]  Back here with Alex Stein from the Conspiracy Castle built by Cat Hair.
[2:33:27.240 --> 2:33:32.040]  Percent. 100% organic Cat Hair though, unvaccinated.
[2:33:32.840 --> 2:33:35.880]  Yeah, these cats aren't going to vaccinate. I know I'm vaccinating, but I want to talk about this.
[2:33:35.880 --> 2:33:39.000]  This is a serious thing because this is what's going on in the world with the infrastructure
[2:33:39.000 --> 2:33:45.080]  bill. This is just the green new deal. So what's happening with this whole entire COVID-19 scam,
[2:33:45.080 --> 2:33:48.440]  this is the whole thing. This has been a scam. They've been trying to do this with the swine
[2:33:48.440 --> 2:33:53.000]  flu with Ebola. They love to use a viral disease. This is just the first year they had to do it
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:56.680]  for the election because they had to get Trump out of there. They had to create a viral disease.
[2:33:56.680 --> 2:33:59.800]  And then what happened was people loved it. People love wearing the mask. I don't think
[2:33:59.800 --> 2:34:02.680]  they expected how much people would like it. I think they actually expected more people to
[2:34:02.680 --> 2:34:07.000]  fight back, especially in America. You see all over Europe, they're having these big parades.
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:10.280]  I mean, these big protests, people are actually fighting for it. Here in America,
[2:34:10.280 --> 2:34:15.160]  people love the mask. It gives all these people these grocery store bag checkers. It gives them
[2:34:15.160 --> 2:34:18.120]  authority to help put on the mask. Oh, it's the easiest virtue signal ever. That's why they love
[2:34:18.120 --> 2:34:22.760]  it. It's the most effortless virtue signal they could ever have. And that's the problem. They're
[2:34:22.760 --> 2:34:28.760]  addicted to it now. Oh, but then they could even put like a gay flag on the mask too. Now they're
[2:34:28.760 --> 2:34:33.960]  double virtually signaling and it's just, oh, well, and everybody has low self-esteem. So they
[2:34:33.960 --> 2:34:38.120]  put on the mask. They can hide theirself. But the problem is most of our interpersonal communication
[2:34:38.120 --> 2:34:42.520]  is nonverbal. We're smiling. We're looking at people. So now everybody's just hiding. We're
[2:34:42.520 --> 2:34:46.920]  getting disconnected. And then you mix that with the internet. But this is the thing is, is SARS
[2:34:46.920 --> 2:34:51.400]  is real. Like, I'm not saying COVID is what they say it is. But before COVID, people have died of
[2:34:51.400 --> 2:34:55.480]  SARS. There's Middle Eastern respiratory virus. We had heard about SARS and MERS. There are such
[2:34:55.480 --> 2:34:59.640]  things as respiratory illnesses. But the reason is the problem is the average age of a coronavirus
[2:34:59.640 --> 2:35:04.760]  death is 81 years old. The average age in the United States is 78 years old. So you actually
[2:35:04.760 --> 2:35:09.880]  live three years longer if you were to die of COVID-19. And people are too stupid to realize
[2:35:09.880 --> 2:35:13.480]  that because they like the mask. They like the restrictions. They like doing work. No, that's
[2:35:13.480 --> 2:35:18.920]  like Sanjay Gupta on Joe Rogan. And maybe maybe Gupta is just pretending to be ignorant of all
[2:35:18.920 --> 2:35:24.520]  this stuff. But this is this is a health expert, a doctor that goes on CNN and Rogan is schooling
[2:35:24.520 --> 2:35:29.320]  him on all this stuff. So Gupta is either pretending to be ignorant or he is truly ignorant.
[2:35:30.760 --> 2:35:34.280]  Well, I don't know if he's that good of an actor because he sounded like such an idiot on there.
[2:35:34.280 --> 2:35:37.960]  And you know, he's going to say as little as possible. But the worst is Leanna Wynn. He's
[2:35:37.960 --> 2:35:42.280]  always with Leanna Wynn. She's the biggest new world order advocate in the world. She was just
[2:35:42.280 --> 2:35:46.520]  with the bot. You saw her talking to the Boston bombing and worried about how her husband might
[2:35:46.520 --> 2:35:50.280]  have been at the finish line where the bomb exploded. And this is at the Boston bombing years
[2:35:50.280 --> 2:35:53.960]  ago. So she's been on their radar. She's been working with, you know, the Clinton initiative
[2:35:53.960 --> 2:35:57.320]  group. She's always been a part of life. You should be the president of Planned Parenthood.
[2:35:57.960 --> 2:36:01.800]  100%. And guess what? She got kicked out of Planned Parenthood because she had an ideological
[2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:05.800]  difference that she had a miscarriage. And at Planned Parenthood, in their verbiage,
[2:36:05.800 --> 2:36:10.280]  you cannot say miscarriage because it's not a life. Any baby that gets a bomb is never a life.
[2:36:10.280 --> 2:36:15.160]  Yes. And so that's why she actually in her book, Lifelines Leanna Wynn got fired. She got let go
[2:36:15.160 --> 2:36:19.000]  from Planned Parenthood because she kept on talking about her miscarriage. And you cannot say
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:22.920]  in Planned Parenthood in their verbiage, there's no such thing as a miscarriage. It's just a
[2:36:22.920 --> 2:36:27.800]  non-birth. And so that's why ideologically, she got fired from there. And she's an evil person.
[2:36:27.800 --> 2:36:31.560]  But at the same time, a lot of these people are puppets. It's like when I say the world's run by
[2:36:32.120 --> 2:36:36.760]  multinational corporations, if you become the CEO of Nabisco Cookies, you don't give a crap that
[2:36:36.760 --> 2:36:40.840]  Oreo gives everybody diary. I mean, diabetes. You don't care that your, you know, Coca-Cola,
[2:36:40.840 --> 2:36:44.440]  they don't care that their product kills people because, you know, they don't have a soul. They
[2:36:44.440 --> 2:36:47.960]  just want to do whatever they can to keep their job. Like all these politicians is all about,
[2:36:47.960 --> 2:36:51.960]  you know, self-preservation. And Leanna Wynn and Sanjay Gupta are the same. They're just going
[2:36:51.960 --> 2:36:55.880]  to repeat the same thing. They're going to be, they're going to say whatever the opposite of
[2:36:55.880 --> 2:36:59.960]  the conspiracy theorists is. And we know the term conspiracy theorists was created by the CIA
[2:36:59.960 --> 2:37:03.800]  during the JFK assassination to demonize people that are looking into the official story. So
[2:37:03.800 --> 2:37:07.400]  that's the problem is these people are their bell cows. They're the people that they know
[2:37:07.400 --> 2:37:12.040]  are not going to go out of bounds because they're so programmed and they're so indoctrinated in
[2:37:12.040 --> 2:37:15.960]  their colleges and their eight years of medical school that these people are never going to go
[2:37:15.960 --> 2:37:21.640]  out of bounds and say anything incorrect. And I think it's just very revealing for people to
[2:37:21.640 --> 2:37:28.520]  see that and they have to reach either one of the two conclusions. Either Gupta is ignorant on all
[2:37:28.520 --> 2:37:33.320]  of this or he's just pretending to be ignorant on all this to fool the audience. Either way,
[2:37:33.320 --> 2:37:38.520]  it doesn't really go well for him. I know you also wanted, yep. Oh, and tell me this,
[2:37:38.520 --> 2:37:43.560]  how does a guy like Brian Stelzer become the lead, basically the lead analyst at CNN? I mean,
[2:37:43.560 --> 2:37:47.880]  the guy is not attractive, has a terrible voice. You know, I mean, and Jim Acosta, the people
[2:37:47.880 --> 2:37:52.760]  these are that are wrong with my voice. And I'm just saying they're the worst broadcasters. They're
[2:37:52.760 --> 2:37:57.880]  not even watchable. So just the fact that they put these people up, it's disgusting. How dare you
[2:37:57.880 --> 2:38:03.880]  say that I have a funny voice? My voice is perfectly normal. It's the lowest form of entertainment.
[2:38:03.880 --> 2:38:11.240]  I'm 33 years old and I look like I'm 50. And I sound like Elmo. There's nothing wrong with that.
[2:38:12.840 --> 2:38:17.480]  I mean, and the fact that he's become so successful is just so sad. And he's the,
[2:38:17.480 --> 2:38:22.440]  you know, he is the biggest champion for the New World Order on CNN. And it's just so sad.
[2:38:22.440 --> 2:38:27.480]  And that's the problem with all media now. It's all about intersectionality. If you don't check
[2:38:27.480 --> 2:38:31.960]  a box, you're not going to be able to be put on a screen. It's like, look at that Kamala Harris
[2:38:31.960 --> 2:38:36.600]  nightmare video where she has that space video with the little kids. There's no white boy. It's
[2:38:36.600 --> 2:38:41.320]  all, you know, it's all like an Asian Pacific kid, a black girl, you know, a Chinese kid,
[2:38:41.320 --> 2:38:47.800]  because, you know, they can't show a representation unless it is of a, you know, and that video,
[2:38:47.800 --> 2:38:52.440]  that video was so odd because I remember I watched the video and I didn't know what
[2:38:52.440 --> 2:38:57.000]  was going on at the time. I thought it was just a normal Kamala Harris antics. She's such a phony.
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:01.720]  There was just a normal Kamala Harris phonyism. And then it turns out, nope, these are all paid
[2:39:01.720 --> 2:39:06.520]  actors. YouTube is claiming that they're the ones that hired them. That may be a cover,
[2:39:06.520 --> 2:39:10.760]  because the same actors were in Michelle Obama videos as well. So I think it's a Democrat
[2:39:10.760 --> 2:39:15.160]  pool of actors that they pull them from, but it's like how many of them, like you said earlier,
[2:39:15.160 --> 2:39:19.480]  how many of these politicians are actors? How many people in our government are literally actors?
[2:39:20.120 --> 2:39:23.320]  Let me say this. Listen, Kamala Harris is my favorite person in the world because she used to
[2:39:23.320 --> 2:39:27.160]  get Raw Dogs by Montell Williams. So let me tell you something. This is what's going to happen.
[2:39:27.160 --> 2:39:30.200]  Joe Biden is going to step down and then we're going to get, then we're going to get my girl
[2:39:30.200 --> 2:39:33.720]  Kamala Harris and it's going to be exactly like a Tyler Perry movie. It's going to be like Medea
[2:39:33.720 --> 2:39:38.280]  goes to the White House. And at that point, I think at that point it actually might wake up
[2:39:38.280 --> 2:39:43.160]  somebody because it will be, because Joe Biden as inept and how dumb he is, I think Kamala Harris
[2:39:43.160 --> 2:39:47.160]  is worse actually because she's even a bigger agent for the new world order. So I'm not saying
[2:39:47.160 --> 2:39:51.080]  it's a good thing, but how Trump is saying like, don't do, don't vote. It's because you got to let
[2:39:51.080 --> 2:39:55.240]  these people shoot themselves in the foot. You always have to let them self sabotage it, give
[2:39:55.240 --> 2:39:59.320]  them the football so they can fumble it because they're not qualified to run the football. Do
[2:39:59.320 --> 2:40:05.560]  you know what I mean? Yeah. And I guess it's just a measurement of how bad do we want it to get
[2:40:05.560 --> 2:40:10.120]  or how bad are we going to let them make things? And we're starting to really get a taste of it,
[2:40:10.120 --> 2:40:14.440]  I think. And, but, but, you know, that's part of the real world learning experience that you're
[2:40:14.440 --> 2:40:19.000]  talking about because it's almost like this weird thing where it's like, I can show people
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:22.840]  dad on masks or I can show people dad on vaccines or I can show people all the data in the world.
[2:40:22.840 --> 2:40:27.480]  It's not going to change their mind. But then, oh, I get, they get a vaccine that causes them to
[2:40:27.480 --> 2:40:32.200]  have a stroke or Gion beret or their aunt to die. Then they learn from the real world experience.
[2:40:32.200 --> 2:40:35.000]  It doesn't matter. I already told them that would be the case. They had to learn it for
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:40.920]  themselves. Oh, and they say that it causes myocarditis in young people and it especially
[2:40:40.920 --> 2:40:46.760]  affects young people. And Gavin Newsom is mandating it for five to 11 year olds. And I know we're
[2:40:46.760 --> 2:40:50.440]  just beating a horse to death because you and I both know this and no amount of evidence will
[2:40:50.440 --> 2:40:54.600]  convince an idiot. But these people are sacrificing their kids like people used to sacrifice their
[2:40:54.600 --> 2:40:57.960]  children to malloc and they don't even realize it. And you're right. The only way they're going
[2:40:57.960 --> 2:41:01.720]  to realize the stove is hot until they touch it and they burn their hands sadly. And that's why
[2:41:01.720 --> 2:41:05.240]  the the VAERS report. They can see the VAERS report and even though a lot of stuff doesn't get
[2:41:05.240 --> 2:41:09.640]  reported, all this information is out there and they've seen it, but they've all chosen not to
[2:41:09.640 --> 2:41:13.560]  believe it. That's that's where we're at in this pandemic. People have all seen both sides and
[2:41:13.560 --> 2:41:17.480]  they're just choosing to stay on the side where they don't have to think where people will choose
[2:41:17.480 --> 2:41:24.360]  for them because everybody is basically a moron sadly. Yeah, ignorance is bliss for only so long.
[2:41:24.360 --> 2:41:30.200]  And going along with all this stuff, what you think it may be for your own political benefit,
[2:41:30.200 --> 2:41:34.680]  you're going to learn the hard way that it's not whether it's you're going to the store and there's
[2:41:34.680 --> 2:41:39.480]  no food on the shelves, whether it's you getting home from work and you can't turn the heat on.
[2:41:39.480 --> 2:41:43.080]  It's all, they're going to experience all of it, which is just sad. I don't want it to be that way
[2:41:43.080 --> 2:41:46.360]  because I'm going to have to live through it with them. But I guess if that's what it takes for them
[2:41:46.360 --> 2:41:51.400]  to wake up and we can take the world back from these heartless, soulless, world government
[2:41:51.400 --> 2:41:55.480]  corporations, then I guess that's what it's going to take. Well, this is how it works out. And as
[2:41:55.480 --> 2:41:59.560]  they lay the trap out, we decide whether to fall in it. And even though things are going to get,
[2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:04.280]  we're going to see manmade horrors beyond our belief. But as long as we don't fall for the
[2:42:04.280 --> 2:42:09.240]  traps, as long as we choose not to fall for the, you know, play their reindeer games, we can actually
[2:42:09.240 --> 2:42:13.400]  stay un unharmed. I firmly believe that because these people aren't good. We're dealing with George
[2:42:13.400 --> 2:42:17.560]  Bush. This is a Prescott Bush. This is the autistic grandchildren of these new world order
[2:42:17.560 --> 2:42:21.880]  leaders. So like I said, these people are going to butt fumble the ball like Mark Sanchez or like
[2:42:21.880 --> 2:42:26.920]  any other imbecile that just inherited the world and that aren't actually, you know, ready to control
[2:42:26.920 --> 2:42:30.760]  it. And you look at Hillary Clinton, she's going to be gone soon. Then we got Barack and Michelle
[2:42:30.760 --> 2:42:35.720]  Obama. These people are going to mess up. Oh, and I promise you, Hillary won't go away. Well,
[2:42:35.720 --> 2:42:41.240]  I got news on Hillary today. Hillary will, she refuses to go away. This wench. All right, but
[2:42:41.240 --> 2:42:45.000]  let's get into this because you said something there. We got to go to break here, Alex. You said
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:48.680]  something. I want to get, I want to get you to go further into this. We're going to see
[2:42:49.560 --> 2:42:54.600]  hellacious manmade horrors in the near future. I agree. I want to hear your opinion on that.
[2:42:54.600 --> 2:42:58.840]  Folks, COVID was manmade. The pandemic was manmade. Imagine what they have next.
[2:42:59.720 --> 2:43:06.120]  The engineers at bio pros are very excited to announce a major expansion of new products
[2:43:06.120 --> 2:43:11.720]  into the retail consumer market. Since their rollout of their first product, almost a year ago,
[2:43:11.720 --> 2:43:20.760]  they come out with four new products, bio drain pro bio RV pro bio marine pro and bio porta pro
[2:43:20.760 --> 2:43:27.640]  for decades. Oil companies and other major chemical corporations have been using patented,
[2:43:27.640 --> 2:43:35.000]  naturally occurring, specially bred bacteria to eat oil spills and other toxic waste disasters.
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:40.840]  That's how powerful these naturally occurring microbes are. The bio pro system is light years
[2:43:40.840 --> 2:43:46.680]  better than traditional enzymes that only work once. These bacteria begin to breed and live
[2:43:46.680 --> 2:43:52.280]  in your septic tank and now it's available for the general public's use for the first time
[2:43:52.280 --> 2:43:57.080]  on the retail market, exclusively available at the bio pros.com.
[2:43:59.720 --> 2:44:04.840]  A little more than 20 years ago, Japanese scientists discovered and were able to isolate
[2:44:04.840 --> 2:44:11.640]  a compound that is naturally in nature and in foods we eat, but in very, very low amounts.
[2:44:11.640 --> 2:44:18.040]  It's called PQQ or bio PQQ. When you have the organic form of it, it does amazing things.
[2:44:18.040 --> 2:44:22.840]  It actually makes your telomeres last longer, doesn't make them grow, but makes them last
[2:44:22.840 --> 2:44:27.160]  longer. This basically the same thing. So it's as close to the fountain of youth as you're going
[2:44:27.160 --> 2:44:33.720]  to get. Well, DNA force plus has been sold out for six months. It's back in stock, the highest quality
[2:44:33.720 --> 2:44:40.280]  PQQ, CoQ 10 and so much more. This entire formula is about cleaning out your cells and helping your
[2:44:40.280 --> 2:44:45.960]  body last longer. And that is so incredibly important. We have it at 40% off, despite the
[2:44:45.960 --> 2:44:50.920]  effects that's been sold out for six months at infowarstore.com. It's amazing. If you haven't
[2:44:50.920 --> 2:44:54.760]  tried DNA force plus, you really should. And for those of you that love it, it's back in stock,
[2:44:54.760 --> 2:44:59.240]  40% off exclusively at infowarstore.com. DNA force plus.
[2:45:01.160 --> 2:45:06.040]  It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film in game blueprint for global
[2:45:06.040 --> 2:45:11.640]  enslavement. And in that documentary, I predicted the globalists would establish world government
[2:45:11.640 --> 2:45:17.720]  by releasing a virus demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns and then triggering a collapse
[2:45:17.720 --> 2:45:22.920]  of our industrial society. And now they've done it. How did I know they would do it? Because
[2:45:22.920 --> 2:45:28.040]  they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and internal meetings were leaked.
[2:45:29.000 --> 2:45:33.240]  You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg group, who's head at the time, was Klaus Schwab.
[2:45:33.240 --> 2:45:38.200]  And our sources inside were confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch this great
[2:45:38.200 --> 2:45:43.240]  reset. Well, we're now living in the purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world,
[2:45:43.800 --> 2:45:48.600]  not attached to the tyrannical corporate world government, the total censorship, no due process,
[2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:54.680]  destruction of the family, and then incrementally more and more deadly injections of poison
[2:45:54.680 --> 2:45:59.720]  mass creating as vaccines to poisonous and depopulated. This is what info wars is fighting.
[2:45:59.720 --> 2:46:07.160]  We're fighting for the future. Info wars emergency supply chain breakdown sale is only running for
[2:46:07.160 --> 2:46:15.160]  one week from Monday, October 11th for seven days. That's because a bunch of these products that we
[2:46:15.160 --> 2:46:21.720]  have in stock are limited supply because obviously the supply chain breakdown that I've been warning
[2:46:21.720 --> 2:46:27.080]  you of now for 20 months, because that's part of the great reset and part of the globalist plan.
[2:46:27.080 --> 2:46:31.000]  That's what global lockdowns have been triggered. So we've not lowered the quality of any of our
[2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:36.760]  products. That means some of them have been sold out for six months, like DNA Force Plus.
[2:46:36.760 --> 2:46:41.960]  It is 40% off, but coming up in one week, it will go back to full price. And we probably won't have
[2:46:41.960 --> 2:46:47.240]  more for up to six months, ladies and gentlemen. So it's a chance to support the broadcast, get
[2:46:47.240 --> 2:46:52.200]  incredible products at the same time, winter sun, ultra 12, they're both 50% off. They're going to
[2:46:52.200 --> 2:46:58.520]  go back to 10% off in a week as well. They're 50% off right now. Find these and more at infowarstore.com
[2:46:58.520 --> 2:47:28.440]  and fund the info world, making your life a lot healthier. I'm asking
[2:47:28.440 --> 2:47:34.040]  the proof that's an actual Tesla quote. I thought they were pulling a quick one because that's
[2:47:34.040 --> 2:47:38.120]  what Alex said in the last segment, but this is apparently a real quote from Tesla. You may live
[2:47:38.120 --> 2:47:43.000]  to see manmade horrors beyond your comprehension. Well, yeah, we've already seen COVID made in a
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:48.440]  lab, which somehow that detail gets left out of all the government approaches towards the COVID
[2:47:48.440 --> 2:47:53.240]  tyranny and the policies. By the way, again, I just say this as an aside because it's just wild.
[2:47:53.240 --> 2:47:59.800]  Declassified FBI documents claim that Nicola Tesla was in communication with space people.
[2:48:00.840 --> 2:48:05.800]  So I don't know what is meant by that, but just a little, little something for you to chew on if
[2:48:05.800 --> 2:48:11.160]  you want to go down that route. But so, you know, Alex, I'll just say this, I had been telling people
[2:48:11.160 --> 2:48:15.400]  about manmade weather phenomenons for years and they would call me crazy. I'd say, look up in the
[2:48:15.400 --> 2:48:20.520]  sky. I mean, what do you do? Don't believe your own line eyes. These lines in the sky aren't natural.
[2:48:20.520 --> 2:48:28.600]  And then I went, they had a public hearing in Texas that the people that do the manmade weather
[2:48:28.600 --> 2:48:32.280]  phenomenons, and I forget that, you know, they have cloud seeding and they have different terms
[2:48:32.280 --> 2:48:36.360]  for it. And they say it's to control rain or help crops. And I went to the whole meeting. I live
[2:48:36.360 --> 2:48:41.480]  streamed it. There's about three hours long. I even got to talk to the scientists and the people
[2:48:41.480 --> 2:48:44.360]  that do it. And they said, and I said, you know, people tell me this doesn't exist. What would
[2:48:44.360 --> 2:48:47.640]  you ever say? They say, yeah, it absolutely exists. What do you mean? Here's the official
[2:48:47.640 --> 2:48:52.440]  documents. So it's the weirdest thing. It's like, I know this is going on. I can prove that it's
[2:48:52.440 --> 2:48:56.840]  going on. And people still don't want to admit it just like the COVID was made in the lab.
[2:48:56.840 --> 2:49:00.040]  So what do you think we're going to see? What what inexplicable,
[2:49:00.760 --> 2:49:05.800]  uncomprehensible manmade phenomenons you think we're going to see next to bring us into a one
[2:49:05.800 --> 2:49:11.400]  world government tyranny? Well, it starts with this after the false flag attacks on 9 11, we signed
[2:49:11.400 --> 2:49:15.320]  the Patriot Act, which gave them warrantless search and seizure of our phones and emails.
[2:49:15.320 --> 2:49:18.680]  So what's going to happen next is they're going to have to do first is going to have an internet
[2:49:18.680 --> 2:49:22.920]  breakdown when Facebook goes out for six hours, people you have soccer moms blowing their brains
[2:49:22.920 --> 2:49:26.760]  out. So all they have to do is turn off the internet for a few hours and all infrastructure
[2:49:26.760 --> 2:49:30.360]  will go out, you know, oh, we won't be able to get trains, nothing will work. So people say, oh,
[2:49:30.360 --> 2:49:33.960]  we got to have a system, the internet of things. So we have constant internet. So that's why the
[2:49:33.960 --> 2:49:37.800]  5g so no way you can lose internet. And what's going to happen is that's going to give us the
[2:49:37.800 --> 2:49:42.280]  Patriot Act 2.0. And they're going to have a warrantless search and seizure of your text messages
[2:49:42.280 --> 2:49:45.960]  of your browser history of every single thing you do. And you're going to sign up for it.
[2:49:45.960 --> 2:49:50.040]  You're going to be, oh, I got the Patriot Act 2.0 and then I got free Krispy Kreme donuts for
[2:49:50.040 --> 2:49:54.520]  doing it. It's so good. And everybody's going to do it. And that is going to be a man made
[2:49:54.520 --> 2:49:57.960]  hoard because what they're going to say is, oh, climate change is so bad from the cloud
[2:49:57.960 --> 2:50:02.120]  seating, you can pay to have your wedding not have rain because they can use this technology
[2:50:02.120 --> 2:50:06.120]  to, you know, either cloud seat or DC the cloud, I guess they call it. So what they're going to
[2:50:06.120 --> 2:50:09.640]  do is they're going to use a climate change to lock us in our houses and they're going to use
[2:50:09.640 --> 2:50:14.360]  our phones as the prison. So for you and I, I mean, at that, at that moment, I don't think I'm
[2:50:14.360 --> 2:50:18.280]  going to follow those rules. I'm going to leave my house, but it's going to be much worse than
[2:50:18.280 --> 2:50:22.040]  that. I'm just saying for you and I, that will be the worst man made horse that we're going to see
[2:50:22.040 --> 2:50:27.080]  very soon that the idea of this infrastructure bill was all put in so that they can put us
[2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:32.360]  under constant surveillance and they can taxes per mile on our car. So that this whole COVID-19
[2:50:32.360 --> 2:50:36.520]  thing was just the beta testing program because look at Australia. Look at these other countries
[2:50:36.520 --> 2:50:40.200]  where they're even more psycho about it. You know, they didn't know how crazy they're going to be
[2:50:40.200 --> 2:50:44.040]  about it. They're just going to see how it worked. So when they had, when they do the climate
[2:50:44.040 --> 2:50:47.320]  change lockdown, they know who's going to kick back, which countries are going to be the biggest
[2:50:47.320 --> 2:50:51.000]  pain in the ass. And that's what's going to be the new issue. I'm telling you, Owen, that is going
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:54.840]  to be the nightmare when you can't drive in your car and they turn it off. That's all the electric
[2:50:54.840 --> 2:50:59.080]  cars, all the digital currency. You won't be able to shop. You'll be on a no fly list. You
[2:50:59.080 --> 2:51:04.280]  literally will not be able to move. And if you do, a tracker will go off on your phone. So it's
[2:51:04.280 --> 2:51:08.440]  literally George Orwell's 1984. And there's a reason they all knew about that. They learned
[2:51:08.440 --> 2:51:11.880]  about it in Tavistock and everything they wrote about in those books you know how to read in school
[2:51:11.880 --> 2:51:16.360]  is sadly is going to come true where everybody's on an antidepressant to try to numb the pain of
[2:51:16.360 --> 2:51:22.440]  living under constant technical technocracy terror. And the craziest part about that,
[2:51:23.240 --> 2:51:28.920]  they'll be watching our fellow humans not see what's going on. Like you said, they'll celebrate
[2:51:28.920 --> 2:51:32.600]  it. They'll celebrate their free donut. They'll celebrate whatever it is they're told, whatever
[2:51:32.600 --> 2:51:38.360]  little kitty bag that they're given. Like they're part of something good, something bigger,
[2:51:38.360 --> 2:51:42.200]  and they won't see how they're just being totally enslaved. And we're just going to sit here and
[2:51:42.200 --> 2:51:46.920]  watch it all in shock and horror. And it's like, hey, we tried to warn you this was happened.
[2:51:46.920 --> 2:51:51.000]  And they'd be like, what? This is great. What do you mean you warned us? This is the most fantastic
[2:51:51.000 --> 2:51:55.080]  thing ever. It's like, how can you not see this was manmade? But yeah, if they can't see how COVID
[2:51:55.080 --> 2:52:00.200]  was manmade, then they'll, I guess they'll just believe anything. Well, and Owen, you look like
[2:52:00.200 --> 2:52:03.640]  I'm not really worried about martial law more than the division they're going to cause an
[2:52:03.640 --> 2:52:09.160]  erase war. Or they're just dividing us so much so where, listen, I love everybody. I'm a culture
[2:52:09.160 --> 2:52:13.240]  of ultra. I love the black culture. But sadly, like there's videos where I'll go to like all
[2:52:13.240 --> 2:52:17.400]  black parties. And you know, the black people are looking me like I'm an enemy because that's all
[2:52:17.400 --> 2:52:21.160]  the social engineering. So this is the problem. This is the manmade horror we're going to see.
[2:52:21.160 --> 2:52:23.880]  I don't necessarily think there's going to be some civil war in the streets because I think
[2:52:23.880 --> 2:52:27.240]  that would get shut down pretty fast. But you're going to have a world where you can't even
[2:52:27.240 --> 2:52:32.200]  shut. They're going to create segregation is coming back. We already see it in non vaccinated
[2:52:32.200 --> 2:52:36.520]  and vaccinated. So it's going to get so deep. We're going to actually be segregated, I believe,
[2:52:36.520 --> 2:52:40.280]  in almost different districts. Like you'll live in Texas because that is more conservative. You'll
[2:52:40.280 --> 2:52:45.880]  live in LA and it'll be so strong that you won't even be able to live in your society. Ideology
[2:52:45.880 --> 2:52:51.160]  here. If you don't align with the same ideas as the state you live in, you will have to move.
[2:52:51.160 --> 2:52:54.200]  That's how intense things are going to get. And for you and me, I think that's going to be a
[2:52:54.200 --> 2:52:58.600]  total manmade horror. And I don't think it would be very long with the Internet going out where
[2:52:58.600 --> 2:53:03.800]  people would start killing each other in the streets as sick as that is. And of course,
[2:53:03.800 --> 2:53:09.560]  the real thing won't be about, oh, somebody can't get on Facebook or somebody can't send a tweet
[2:53:09.560 --> 2:53:13.960]  out or whatever. Like you said, it's going to be, oh, the trains are shut down, the airplanes are
[2:53:13.960 --> 2:53:18.200]  shut down, the energy is shut down, everything shut down because of the Internet. And who knows,
[2:53:18.200 --> 2:53:22.680]  they'll blame Russia. I don't think they still want to do Middle East terrorists as the boogeyman
[2:53:22.680 --> 2:53:26.520]  anymore. I think that that thing has kind of gone its way. So they'll either blame Russia
[2:53:26.520 --> 2:53:31.240]  or they'll have an operation. They'll blame China. Well, let me say this, people want to say systemic
[2:53:31.240 --> 2:53:35.240]  racism doesn't exist, but I can prove the systemic racism does exist because they're unfairly,
[2:53:35.240 --> 2:53:39.320]  they used to go after the Muslim terrorists. I think it was last action hero in order to use,
[2:53:39.320 --> 2:53:42.840]  you know, a lot of the military stuff, they wanted to do like Chinese terrorists. And they said,
[2:53:42.840 --> 2:53:47.240]  no, you have to do Muslim terrorists. But now they're going after white guys like you. You are the
[2:53:47.240 --> 2:53:51.800]  new domestic terrorists. They're systematically racist towards white people. The FBI is,
[2:53:51.800 --> 2:53:56.760]  because now they're done by all these wokeism and all this intersectionality that now they're
[2:53:56.760 --> 2:54:02.360]  actually going after people that are literally white and they're literally racist, reverse racism.
[2:54:02.360 --> 2:54:05.080]  And that's real. I don't know how you could tell me any difference when you think about it.
[2:54:05.080 --> 2:54:09.880]  No, you're absolutely right. And they look at it as it's like a veil of protection. It's like a
[2:54:09.880 --> 2:54:14.600]  hedge of protection against them. It's like, look, I'm against white people. I hate white people.
[2:54:14.600 --> 2:54:18.520]  See, I'm a good person. That's what they look at it. It's like they could be the worst person on
[2:54:18.520 --> 2:54:23.240]  our biggest criminal, totally corrupt government politician, whatever FBI. But oh, oh, they hate
[2:54:23.240 --> 2:54:30.520]  white people, then they must be good. I know. And it's, I mean, the demonization of white people
[2:54:30.520 --> 2:54:35.080]  right now is so strong. You can't even watch like, you know, the media has always been using social
[2:54:35.080 --> 2:54:38.760]  engineering. But now every commercial, I mean, every McDonald's commercial has never had a white
[2:54:38.760 --> 2:54:42.600]  guy in it. But you're just coming in a day and age where you literally turn on a car insurance
[2:54:42.600 --> 2:54:49.000]  commercial and it's a transgender girl. I mean, we are living in the clown world. You know that.
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:53.320]  I know that. And sadly, I don't know when people are going to break out of it, because we said
[2:54:53.320 --> 2:54:57.480]  this already, no amount of evidence can convince an idiot of what's really going on.
[2:54:59.080 --> 2:55:04.440]  Well, it's sad because they're going to be, they're going to go through so much torture
[2:55:04.440 --> 2:55:09.080]  with all of this. Right now, it's with the vaccines that are getting them sick and with
[2:55:09.080 --> 2:55:13.720]  the shutdowns that they're all involved in. I mean, I feel bad. Like I got stories today.
[2:55:13.720 --> 2:55:17.560]  I'm going to cover later on the war room and just all these people dying from the vaccine.
[2:55:17.560 --> 2:55:21.800]  And it's just like, oh, well, well, we're still going to mandate it. I mean, if they mandated a
[2:55:21.800 --> 2:55:26.520]  leg amputation, would you do that too? Oh, and how stupid are people? They say we're in the worst
[2:55:26.520 --> 2:55:30.840]  part of a pandemic. And I do believe the hospitals are full. And now they're firing healthcare
[2:55:30.840 --> 2:55:37.080]  workers. If we were in a real pandemic, do you think we could afford to fire healthcare workers?
[2:55:37.080 --> 2:55:40.840]  No, but people are so dumb. That's why all these hospitals in Houston are letting go of their
[2:55:40.840 --> 2:55:45.720]  whole staff. And I do believe we know people are getting messed up from the vaccine. We know
[2:55:45.720 --> 2:55:49.720]  young people are getting myocarditis at a rate that we've never, ever seen. And then Pfizer comes
[2:55:49.720 --> 2:55:55.240]  out with a first ever blood thinner for children. I mean, they had this planned all along. Alex
[2:55:55.240 --> 2:55:59.800]  talks about this. Everybody had talked about this, the mandatory vaccines. And now their plan
[2:55:59.800 --> 2:56:04.840]  worked. So it's on to the next one. And this is what they love, the TikTok nurses, the dancing,
[2:56:04.840 --> 2:56:09.320]  these healthcare workers, this is the problem moment is they need it to be as bad as possible
[2:56:09.320 --> 2:56:13.480]  because that gives them as much clout that gives them the most respect. So the worse it is,
[2:56:13.480 --> 2:56:17.800]  the better they look. So they're always going to encourage the chaos. They're always going to make
[2:56:17.800 --> 2:56:22.760]  you make the selfie videos with the mask marks on their face. Like, oh, my God, today was so bad.
[2:56:22.760 --> 2:56:28.120]  We lost a vaccine. We lost an unvaccinated patient and his family was crying about him. If he just
[2:56:28.120 --> 2:56:31.640]  would have been vaccinated, he'd live, which is so far this thing from the truth actually just came
[2:56:31.640 --> 2:56:36.280]  out with a study. It was the front page of Daily Mail. One out of every 25,000 that have been
[2:56:36.280 --> 2:56:40.920]  vaccinated dies of COVID. And I believe it's a much higher number than that. So they even tell
[2:56:40.920 --> 2:56:45.000]  you these numbers and people still believe that vaccines are safe and effective when, listen,
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:49.240]  oh, and you and I both know almonds are not safe and effective for everyone. Peanuts are not safe
[2:56:49.240 --> 2:56:52.280]  and effective for everyone. If you went to a baseball game and you gave some kid a peanut,
[2:56:52.280 --> 2:56:57.960]  and you had a peanut allergy, he would die. So you cannot tell me a vaccine with mRNA technology
[2:56:57.960 --> 2:57:02.520]  made from aborted fetal cells that somebody's not allergic to that. So that's the problem. As soon
[2:57:02.520 --> 2:57:06.360]  as they say it's safe and effective for everyone, you know it's a lie because there's no panacea
[2:57:06.360 --> 2:57:10.200]  that works like that. If an almond doesn't even work like that. Yeah, I mean, pretty much anything
[2:57:10.200 --> 2:57:15.720]  I see from mainstream media, I count as a lie until I can be proven true. Alex Stein, conspiracy
[2:57:15.720 --> 2:57:22.200]  castle, great to have you on today. And you know, we probably have you back on. It was a wonderful
[2:57:22.200 --> 2:57:29.720]  hour. And I need to look more into your content as well. You're a master level troll, I think.
[2:57:29.720 --> 2:57:34.760]  And so we may have something in common there. Yes, we are. I would love to ever create some
[2:57:34.760 --> 2:57:37.560]  content. I'll come down to Austin. I'll do anything. And one last thing I want to say.
[2:57:37.560 --> 2:57:42.520]  There we go. RIP Rob Skiba. He was a great guy, geocentrists. I just want to say RIP.
[2:57:43.160 --> 2:57:47.400]  We lost a good man. And thank you for letting me come on. And you are a true patriot on anybody
[2:57:47.400 --> 2:57:51.560]  that says you're not a patriot. Anybody that there was there. I think the tyranny and oppression
[2:57:51.560 --> 2:57:57.400]  we're living under now is bad. Wait till they've got their world ID hand. And that's exactly what
[2:57:57.400 --> 2:58:03.640]  the COVID passports are all about. And clout swab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders
[2:58:03.640 --> 2:58:09.560]  own words. They admit that once they've got you with that system, then they're going to carbon
[2:58:09.560 --> 2:58:15.240]  tax you everywhere you go and track what you do. And publicly, they're saying they're going to decide
[2:58:15.240 --> 2:58:20.760]  when you can travel and when you can't travel and mastercard and all the other big companies
[2:58:20.760 --> 2:58:25.640]  are currently announcing they're going to track what you do and where you go and tax you with a
[2:58:25.640 --> 2:58:31.720]  carbon tax for it. This is the holy grail of tyranny, ladies and gentlemen. This is the takeover
[2:58:31.720 --> 2:58:36.680]  in humanity. Better wake up and say no. Finally, folks are starting to wake up. Joe Rogan, Tucker
[2:58:36.680 --> 2:58:41.400]  Carlson, others are leaving the charts along with info wars. But it's not enough. Every individual
[2:58:41.400 --> 2:58:45.880]  has to not comply. And we have to talk about bringing the globalist to justice. You see,
[2:58:45.880 --> 2:58:52.280]  they need the fear of God put in them legally and lawfully. People ask me all the time, Alex,
[2:58:52.280 --> 2:58:57.400]  the last three months or so, you've had explosive energy on top of your already very
[2:58:57.400 --> 2:59:01.400]  intense level of energy. What's happening? Well, it's the things that are happening in the world
[2:59:01.400 --> 2:59:05.880]  right now. That's got my blood up. But also, I've gotten back in the groove of religiously
[2:59:05.880 --> 2:59:11.640]  taking three products every single day. DNA force plus that's back in stock. Also,
[2:59:11.640 --> 2:59:17.400]  so X2 deep breath crystal iodine that's essential for your immune system, your whole body. And of
[2:59:17.400 --> 2:59:23.240]  course, at nighttime, down and out sleep aid that makes me have deeper, cleaner, restful sleep
[2:59:23.240 --> 2:59:28.440]  that again boost my immune system and is good for every cell in my body and great for the spirit.
[2:59:28.440 --> 2:59:33.080]  All three of these products are in stock right now. They are 40% off in the case of DNA force
[2:59:33.080 --> 2:59:39.800]  plus and 50% off for one week only on survival shield X2. And yes, until supplies last, we have
[2:59:39.800 --> 2:59:45.960]  down and out 50% off and then forward store.com. This is the trifecta. I suggest you check it out
[2:59:45.960 --> 3:00:11.560]  and experience what this does for your body today. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:11.560 --> 3:00:16.440]  Radio didn't allow but not even have the documents proving they did. And they said they were going
[3:00:16.440 --> 3:00:20.760]  to release it total smoking gun. Oh, no, the news is saying it happened because you had a car or air
[3:00:20.760 --> 3:00:24.920]  conditioning. It's your fault. You're dying. It's your fault. There's human animal clones. It's your
[3:00:24.920 --> 3:00:29.800]  fault. There's deadly viruses, five of them spliced together and released all confirmed. It's your
[3:00:29.800 --> 3:00:36.360]  fault. There's human animal clones, the US Senate headline. US Senate refuses to ban certain types
[3:00:36.360 --> 3:00:42.600]  of animal human hybrids. Senate kills GOP legislation prohibits certain human animal hybrids.
[3:00:43.240 --> 3:00:48.360]  Chimera's Forbes, just like it's a fact that the Pfizer shot and the Moderna shot give you
[3:00:48.360 --> 3:01:12.200]  cancer cause heart attacks. Destroy your immune system. Don't protect you. Pfizer asked US to
[3:01:12.200 --> 3:01:17.480]  allow COVID shots for kids ages five to 11, even though the only children that have died less than
[3:01:17.480 --> 3:01:23.240]  50 had heart attacks, cancer, three or four comorbidities and didn't die of COVID. Just in time
[3:01:23.240 --> 3:01:28.280]  for holiday travel. That's when nearly 30 million children between the ages of five and 11 could
[3:01:28.280 --> 3:01:34.040]  become eligible for the Pfizer vaccine. Today, the company officially asking the FDA for emergency
[3:01:34.040 --> 3:01:40.120]  use authorization. Doesn't matter. Europe just banned these vaccines for under 30s because they
[3:01:40.120 --> 3:01:45.080]  were killing so many people. But don't worry. They're gonna double down and say, Oh, no, pregnant
[3:01:45.080 --> 3:01:50.440]  women need it. Remember, what did I say hundreds of times here? I said immortal cell lines, all the
[3:01:50.440 --> 3:01:55.560]  major vaccines are basically grown on immortal cell lines. They may grow them on eggs at the end
[3:01:55.560 --> 3:02:02.200]  of the day, but the original new batches are made in the immortal cell line of a, a boarded boy who
[3:02:02.200 --> 3:02:08.600]  was eight and a half months old in his mother in 1966. And they found that his cells cause they've
[3:02:08.600 --> 3:02:13.720]  tested millions of people's cells, dead people, babies, they killed others. Most people's cells
[3:02:13.720 --> 3:02:20.520]  won't keep dividing and won't grow in any type of medium. And so they've got two major cell lines
[3:02:20.520 --> 3:02:27.800]  they like to use best. It's a dead black woman from 1951 and a dead white boy from 1966. You can
[3:02:27.800 --> 3:02:35.240]  start with one single cell and multiply it again and again, and then freeze all of those cells
[3:02:36.280 --> 3:02:42.200]  with which you can then make vaccines. And they keep growing their cells like I've seen some
[3:02:42.200 --> 3:02:48.680]  estimations that Henrietta lacks. They've probably grown the equivalent of 20 million of her.
[3:02:49.480 --> 3:02:52.920]  They don't grow up her whole body. They just clone her cells. This lady don't die.
[3:02:53.640 --> 3:03:00.200]  She'll grow on a tabletop in sunlight. Her cells will. They're magic. They're the best.
[3:03:00.200 --> 3:03:05.240]  The surprising tenacity of her cancer cells, which made them so important to medical research,
[3:03:05.240 --> 3:03:12.680]  also ultimately took her life. Henrietta Lacks died in October 1951 at the age of 31.
[3:03:13.320 --> 3:03:18.280]  As her cells were taken without her knowledge in an era before the concept of informed consent
[3:03:18.280 --> 3:03:24.520]  existed, Henrietta died never knowing how important her cells would be. You know, it's been 70 years
[3:03:24.520 --> 3:03:30.120]  since medical experts took Henrietta Lacks's cancerous cells. Her family has filed a civil
[3:03:30.120 --> 3:03:36.680]  lawsuit against Thermo Fisher Scientific, one of the world's leading biotech companies, for taking
[3:03:36.680 --> 3:03:43.000]  her cells without permission. The lawsuit claims the company made a conscious choice to sell and
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:49.800]  mass produce Lacks's living tissue cells without consent. Her cells were the first human cells to
[3:03:49.800 --> 3:03:56.120]  successfully be cloned since then they've been used in medical research. The lawsuit also accuses
[3:03:56.120 --> 3:04:02.280]  Thermo Fisher Scientific of making staggering profits off of Lacks when not even compensating
[3:04:02.280 --> 3:04:06.680]  her family at all. They came in and saw her, decided not to operate on her just because she
[3:04:06.680 --> 3:04:10.600]  never shoot Lacks up a civilist back then, this mad scientist, the ones that trained Fauci. It's the
[3:04:10.600 --> 3:04:16.920]  same people. They just pass on the club and she came in and had that tumor and they said,
[3:04:16.920 --> 3:04:22.120]  you just come back and see us in a couple weeks. She was dead. That tumor ate large portions of
[3:04:22.120 --> 3:04:25.640]  her body and they said, let's take her away and check her. We've never seen cancer grow like this.
[3:04:27.320 --> 3:04:31.800]  Bad scientists won't play God. They are on you now. They're growing clones. They're spicing
[3:04:31.800 --> 3:04:35.240]  humans and animals. They're doing it all and they want you out of their way. Well, what did
[3:04:35.240 --> 3:04:39.400]  Fauci and the head of the HHS and the rest of them say in that video from 2019, they said,
[3:04:39.400 --> 3:04:44.200]  we need a big deadly virus out of China to get released. We can stampede everybody and do whatever
[3:04:44.200 --> 3:04:57.480]  we want and just totally take over. Watch the American Journal Weekday mornings, 8 to 11 central at
[3:04:57.480 --> 3:05:05.240]  band. And in addition, we were really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems
[3:05:05.240 --> 3:05:10.280]  of these employees because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical energy
[3:05:10.280 --> 3:05:15.400]  during your work or during your tasks, whatever it might be, you're really stressing the cardiopulmonary
[3:05:15.400 --> 3:05:20.760]  system because you change the way that you breathe. You have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale.
[3:05:20.760 --> 3:05:26.520]  That taxes the heart. It taxes the lungs and we have given people heart attacks by allowing them
[3:05:26.520 --> 3:05:34.040]  to work with their mouth and nose covered with absolutely no regulation, no oversight, no medical
[3:05:34.040 --> 3:05:39.160]  oversight. The globalists have told us we're a disease. They've told us they want to eradicate us
[3:05:39.160 --> 3:05:44.280]  and all the studies show that when you wear these masks, it lowers your oxygen level up to one third
[3:05:44.280 --> 3:05:50.040]  and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide poisoning. This is a sick cult and we've got to
[3:05:50.040 --> 3:05:55.640]  say no, but the only way the real science can sound to the public is if we tell them, get your copy
[3:05:55.640 --> 3:06:11.560]  today of COVIDland and expose them. It's covidland.com. Go there now.
[3:06:26.440 --> 3:06:34.040]  Hi there. I'm Kate Dally, your guest host today from the Kate Dally show. Happy to be here and
[3:06:34.040 --> 3:06:40.760]  happy to address a really big issue, big picture issue today. I love doing the backstory to things
[3:06:40.760 --> 3:06:46.200]  and that's what I'm going to do today. I want to address our perspective. Our perspective is hugely
[3:06:46.200 --> 3:06:51.000]  important to what's happening right now and how we view the world and this could be a really,
[3:06:51.000 --> 3:06:55.880]  really powerful hour. Maybe we'll even hit some light bulb moments for you. Maybe you know everything
[3:06:55.880 --> 3:07:01.640]  I'm about to say, but nonetheless, we have a huge division in this country. I was thinking about
[3:07:01.640 --> 3:07:09.560]  this a while back and I was thinking about our fears and how the vaccinated fear, the unvaccinated,
[3:07:09.560 --> 3:07:16.440]  like we're going to kill them off at any moment, even though they're healthy, and how the unvaccinated
[3:07:16.440 --> 3:07:21.160]  are nervous about being around the vaccinated because I think they're a walking biological
[3:07:21.160 --> 3:07:26.360]  weapon. So you have a clear division in the country where a third of the country really
[3:07:26.360 --> 3:07:31.960]  does fear the vaccinated. And so how do we get to that point? There's two sets of fears. There's
[3:07:31.960 --> 3:07:37.880]  a set of fears on the left for the leftist and the set of fears on the right for conservatives.
[3:07:37.880 --> 3:07:44.120]  And the interesting issue here is that we both have a set of fears. The fear of the fears on the
[3:07:44.120 --> 3:07:50.200]  left would be, I fear germs are going to kill me at any moment. I fear the climate is going to come
[3:07:50.200 --> 3:07:55.000]  get me. Every decade, at the end of every decade, I'm either going to be a shish kebab or I'm going
[3:07:55.000 --> 3:08:02.360]  to be a frozen rotunda. And that everybody needs to be controlled by government or we'll be wild
[3:08:02.360 --> 3:08:08.920]  animals. This is the belief system. On the conservative side or they'll call, they'll mock
[3:08:08.920 --> 3:08:16.120]  it and say it's a conspiracy theory side. It's more or less, hey, the deep state will take
[3:08:16.120 --> 3:08:23.880]  liberty or liberty. And there is a new world order. And they have some well-laid plans and
[3:08:23.880 --> 3:08:29.160]  they might crash the economy to build their wealth and power. Well, if you look back in history,
[3:08:30.600 --> 3:08:38.040]  you know, centuries of generations, history is only going to prove one set of those fears to be
[3:08:38.040 --> 3:08:45.560]  true. Can you guess which one? So what keeps us divided? What keeps us on this track? And you
[3:08:45.560 --> 3:08:51.160]  know what? The one question we're horrible at asking. And after being on the radio for 10 years,
[3:08:51.160 --> 3:08:58.360]  I can tell you this with straight-up conviction is the fact that we never ask what caused that.
[3:08:58.360 --> 3:09:04.040]  What caused World War II? What caused Great Depression? What caused the CDC to have more
[3:09:04.040 --> 3:09:09.320]  power than the doctors? What caused Polio to spike in the first place? Nobody asks this.
[3:09:10.280 --> 3:09:16.760]  And the backstory, the backstory is really, really a game changer because if we understand true
[3:09:16.760 --> 3:09:21.800]  history to everything, it takes away power from the cockroaches that think they rule the world.
[3:09:21.800 --> 3:09:29.320]  Context is key. History is key. And people are tuning in to hear what fake cheese says next.
[3:09:29.320 --> 3:09:35.960]  And now it's Halloween. Can our kids go out and go door to door on Halloween? Give me a break.
[3:09:36.680 --> 3:09:42.680]  Well, I want to go somewhere and I kind of want to do the broad picture here. Have you
[3:09:42.680 --> 3:09:51.880]  heard of William Henry Welch? He was fouchy back in the day. And he was groomed. He was funded. He
[3:09:51.880 --> 3:10:00.520]  was willing. He was born in the late 1800s. He was a Yale man. Skull and bones all the way, baby.
[3:10:00.520 --> 3:10:07.880]  Of course he was. Why am I even shocked anymore? The Rockefellers really wanted to take control
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:13.000]  of the medical field and Welch was their guy. And hopefully I'm going to go over some things that
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:18.680]  maybe have not really been brought to light out there because there's a big understanding that
[3:10:18.680 --> 3:10:26.280]  needs to take place in how they wanted to take over pharma and exactly how the public health
[3:10:26.280 --> 3:10:35.480]  arrived and got the power that it got. So in his biography, in Welch's biography,
[3:10:35.480 --> 3:10:40.600]  there's a single sentence that really caught my eye. And it was that he went over to Germany
[3:10:40.600 --> 3:10:46.600]  after Yale to be trained and then come back here. Why in the world did he have to go to Germany?
[3:10:46.600 --> 3:10:54.200]  Oh, the backstory. So the Rockefellers had a plan to engineer Johns Hopkins as the hub
[3:10:54.200 --> 3:10:59.560]  of the newly organized crime medical community. And I don't say that lightly. I really mean that.
[3:11:00.120 --> 3:11:06.200]  In 1913, the Rockefeller Foundation sponsored a conference on the need for public health education
[3:11:06.200 --> 3:11:14.440]  in the United States. And the Welch-Rose report of 1915 laid out the need for adequately trained
[3:11:14.440 --> 3:11:20.280]  public health workers and then envisioned an Institute of Hygiene for the United States.
[3:11:21.080 --> 3:11:26.920]  So this report reflected that these different preferences of the plans to architects. You
[3:11:26.920 --> 3:11:32.680]  had Welch on one side. He favored scientific research. And then you had Wycliffe Rose who
[3:11:32.680 --> 3:11:40.120]  wanted the emphasis on public health practices. So Welch was about to become their first director
[3:11:40.120 --> 3:11:46.200]  when they designated Johns Hopkins as the new hub of what was going to become public health.
[3:11:47.000 --> 3:11:53.320]  And when Welch went off to Germany, he was getting well trained in the new study of chemicals,
[3:11:54.920 --> 3:11:58.680]  pathogens from the scientists, right, who were working on these at the time.
[3:11:59.320 --> 3:12:04.840]  And so up until the 1900s, we had the town doctor, didn't we? The town doctor, you had a problem,
[3:12:04.840 --> 3:12:08.600]  you went to the town doctor, you got some help, the doctor had all kinds of remedies,
[3:12:08.600 --> 3:12:15.560]  natural and otherwise, time-tested remedies. Some, you know, they needed some work. Some
[3:12:15.560 --> 3:12:19.800]  were great. They were respected amongst the town people. We had midwives, we had doctors,
[3:12:19.800 --> 3:12:24.600]  we had all kinds of people helping, right? Well, the Rockefellers wanted to change all
[3:12:24.600 --> 3:12:29.560]  that. And they wanted to make sure that they could absolutely take the power away from the
[3:12:29.560 --> 3:12:35.560]  doctors. Well, how did they do it? They designed a new role for them. The use of chemicals or
[3:12:35.560 --> 3:12:42.360]  pharma was just taking root. And this was a really great time to take control of the doctor's training.
[3:12:43.720 --> 3:12:50.120]  And what they really wanted to do was pigeonhole the doctors into only one aspect of medicine,
[3:12:50.760 --> 3:12:57.320]  diagnosing symptoms and giving a prescription. That was it. That's what they wanted the doctors to do.
[3:12:57.320 --> 3:13:06.280]  John Hopkins as the hub and Welch as their new director would have to invent or insert a need
[3:13:06.280 --> 3:13:12.120]  for public health, a new entity. This was going to be intertwined in government by controlling many
[3:13:12.120 --> 3:13:17.560]  of the things that doctors did and really taking away what really made doctors special. And that
[3:13:17.560 --> 3:13:24.920]  was that they were treating health. Okay? So in America, in a free country, there's no need for
[3:13:24.920 --> 3:13:30.520]  public health, right? You wouldn't need government controlled health. You have doctors, people have
[3:13:30.520 --> 3:13:36.200]  the freedom to go to whatever doctor they want. You get sick, you go, problem solved. You don't
[3:13:36.200 --> 3:13:43.480]  need a government controlled agency. But and you don't need the government controlled agency to
[3:13:43.480 --> 3:13:49.640]  tell you to wash your hands 50,000 times a day. I'm really tired of that. You just need a good mom.
[3:13:49.640 --> 3:13:54.440]  A good mom can cover that base, but they wanted to take over most of the duties of the doctor. And
[3:13:54.440 --> 3:14:00.760]  they needed an opportunity to showcase how important it was to have public health on the scene.
[3:14:01.720 --> 3:14:08.360]  It was kind of like that mantra of see you really, really need me. You can't live without me. See
[3:14:08.360 --> 3:14:16.920]  how important I am. They had to invent a way to make sure that you realized that what they were
[3:14:16.920 --> 3:14:22.440]  about to propose was going to be different and better for America. Public health was going to
[3:14:22.440 --> 3:14:29.800]  take over prevention and and all of the other things that doctors didn't do. And they were about
[3:14:29.800 --> 3:14:35.640]  to control the healthcare industry like we had never seen before. And so Welch, now the director
[3:14:35.640 --> 3:14:43.080]  of Johns Hopkins, the Rockefeller creation, saw that people had hookworm in the southern states.
[3:14:43.080 --> 3:14:48.840]  Okay, this was rarely fatal. And it affected people in the southern states. They would walk
[3:14:48.840 --> 3:14:55.400]  around barefoot. But this wasn't really something that was, you know, killing people off. It wasn't
[3:14:55.400 --> 3:15:02.360]  like the most the biggest problem that we had on our hands. And they decided to pinpoint this as
[3:15:02.360 --> 3:15:08.200]  the catalyst as the driving point to make themselves a role to give themselves a role, I
[3:15:08.200 --> 3:15:13.880]  should say, and make themselves important in our lives so that we couldn't live without them.
[3:15:13.880 --> 3:15:19.640]  Right. When I come back, I want to tell you a little bit about what they did with hookworm,
[3:15:19.640 --> 3:15:24.680]  because it was a little bit what they're doing today. You've got COVID flu, COVID pneumonia,
[3:15:24.680 --> 3:15:30.680]  COVID cold, you know, very rarely is it going to be fatal. Every single state in the union
[3:15:30.680 --> 3:15:36.840]  is under 0.0 and then whatever number. I mean, it's not even like it gets a full digit. So
[3:15:38.040 --> 3:15:42.120]  they use the same playbook. And when we come back, I want to tell you how they did it.
[3:15:42.120 --> 3:15:46.760]  And then I want to tell you where this is leading and why when we come back. So,
[3:15:46.760 --> 3:15:52.280]  and I want to talk a little bit about pharma and about the, about the use of chemicals.
[3:15:52.280 --> 3:16:11.960]  So stay tuned. I'm Kate Daly, your guest host, the Kate Daly show, KateDalyRadio.com.
[3:16:22.440 --> 3:16:35.000]  Hey, everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture? Me too.
[3:16:35.000 --> 3:16:39.320]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[3:16:39.320 --> 3:16:44.760]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on. It's that immune system health can literally be the
[3:16:44.760 --> 3:16:49.800]  difference between life and death. You probably already believe that. I certainly do. So here's
[3:16:49.800 --> 3:16:55.000]  the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually
[3:16:55.000 --> 3:17:00.840]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support. Now, you'll have to sign a waiver,
[3:17:00.840 --> 3:17:06.120]  but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefense.com. No cures or treatments there.
[3:17:06.120 --> 3:17:12.040]  Instead, little known, but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support product
[3:17:12.040 --> 3:17:17.560]  based on that research called immune 10X. And the best part, you can go to the stronger defense

[3:17:33.560 --> 3:17:38.760]  they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[3:17:38.760 --> 3:17:42.760]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people
[3:17:42.760 --> 3:17:47.320]  deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you owe taxes,
[3:17:47.320 --> 3:17:53.000]  you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case. Call 800-34,
[3:17:53.000 --> 3:17:59.240]  no tax, or go to my website, danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:18:02.280 --> 3:18:07.400]  I want to be very clear. The fact that InfoWars is having trouble funding itself is not the fault
[3:18:07.400 --> 3:18:13.000]  of our amazing listeners and supporters. It is the fault of the globalists. When we can get
[3:18:13.000 --> 3:18:17.240]  enough of our great supplements, other products in, we're able to sell enough of it to stay on air
[3:18:17.240 --> 3:18:21.960]  and quite frankly even expand in the face of the new world war. But because of the supply chain
[3:18:21.960 --> 3:18:26.520]  breakdowns that were very easy to predict from the global lockdowns, we're designed to do that.
[3:18:26.520 --> 3:18:30.920]  We have had real problems getting our best selling products in. Some of them take up to 10
[3:18:30.920 --> 3:18:35.720]  months to get in. We've had to discontinue some of our products because we just can't get the
[3:18:35.720 --> 3:18:41.000]  ingredients anymore. It's pretty scary stuff. So please take advantage of sales we're running
[3:18:41.000 --> 3:18:47.480]  for one week only. There's only one week left from October 11th for seven days, kicks off October 11th
[3:18:47.480 --> 3:18:53.160]  on things like DNA Force Plus at 40% off, Winter Sun at 50% off, Ultra 12 at 50% off,
[3:18:53.160 --> 3:18:58.520]  and more at infowarsstore.com. One week left, check out these incredible deals.
[3:18:58.520 --> 3:19:09.960]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the
[3:19:09.960 --> 3:19:15.320]  change that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations
[3:19:15.320 --> 3:19:22.600]  has put in place. It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[3:19:22.600 --> 3:19:27.720]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[3:19:27.720 --> 3:19:37.320]  faces from the light of the sun. It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to
[3:19:37.320 --> 3:19:45.160]  evil. Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now. The entire future destiny of humanity
[3:19:45.160 --> 3:19:50.040]  is upon us. Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[3:19:50.040 --> 3:19:55.800]  the World ID and Carbon Taxes. Things only get worse from here if we submit. They only get better
[3:19:55.800 --> 3:20:00.600]  if we resist and say no. Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[3:20:03.800 --> 3:20:06.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:17.640 --> 3:20:21.880]  Back with you, Kate Daly from the Kate Daly Show, KateDalyRadio.com.
[3:20:21.880 --> 3:20:25.880]  I'm glad you're joining me for this because sometimes we need to kind of go over the big picture
[3:20:25.880 --> 3:20:32.760]  just a little bit to understand why we're here. Why are we asking Fauci? Our kids can trick or
[3:20:32.760 --> 3:20:40.040]  treat if it's safe enough. Can you even imagine the power that they've amassed? Sickening.
[3:20:43.000 --> 3:20:46.920]  And the more we see it and the more people that see it and the more eyeballs that wake up
[3:20:47.480 --> 3:20:51.560]  to what's going on, maybe they'll see it in a completely different way that they can't unsee.
[3:20:51.560 --> 3:20:57.720]  That usually happens with truth. So they were using hookworm, public health, to carve out
[3:20:57.720 --> 3:21:02.600]  a niche for themselves. Not even a niche, really just to take over. They really wanted to take
[3:21:02.600 --> 3:21:10.920]  over healthcare. So they told the people, well, if you just use these epsom salts and drink this
[3:21:10.920 --> 3:21:16.360]  stuff, you'll be great. Well, people did. They got better. It was something that the doctors could
[3:21:16.360 --> 3:21:22.920]  have done. But instead of the doctors doing it, public health decided to kind of put their stamp
[3:21:22.920 --> 3:21:31.640]  on, look at us, look at us. And so they took credit for the eradication of hookworm, right?
[3:21:32.360 --> 3:21:38.520]  And so what happened was they divided up this healthcare and they basically wanted to tell
[3:21:38.520 --> 3:21:44.280]  the doctors, you're only going to be involved with, what does the matter with me when a patient
[3:21:44.280 --> 3:21:49.720]  says that and what can be done to relieve me? And that's it. That's all you're going to do.
[3:21:49.720 --> 3:21:55.320]  And public health gets to do the prevention, the mode of spread, the methods of preventing,
[3:21:55.320 --> 3:22:01.080]  the identification, the analysis, everything. They were taking more power than the doctors even
[3:22:01.080 --> 3:22:09.160]  realized. So Welch designed Johns Hopkins about around sort of what he learned in Germany. And
[3:22:09.160 --> 3:22:16.840]  I bet you did not see that coming. Anyway, Welch's prominent students included Walter Reed,
[3:22:16.840 --> 3:22:21.880]  of course, Walter Reed Medical Center. And he was also the president of the New American Medical
[3:22:21.880 --> 3:22:30.760]  Association. The MAA, the AMA became the gatekeeper for deciding what training our doctors would get.
[3:22:32.040 --> 3:22:35.960]  Welch was also the founding editor of Journal of Experimental Medicine.
[3:22:35.960 --> 3:22:43.320]  Yeah. Did you catch that? Experimental Medicine. What are we doing now? Experimental Medicine.
[3:22:43.960 --> 3:22:48.200]  The scientists that he studied with over in Germany were creating, I mean, discovering
[3:22:49.400 --> 3:22:55.720]  things like anthrax. Boy, you just discover it. That's interesting. Anyway, it all started in
[3:22:55.720 --> 3:23:06.360]  the 1800s with the discovery of synthetic dyes. Interesting. Dying dyes. Anyway, dyes for clothing,
[3:23:06.360 --> 3:23:09.720]  that sort of thing. And this became the start. Actually, it was the color mauve.
[3:23:10.440 --> 3:23:17.080]  This became the start of chemical medicine. And the Hoitzch company started out in 1863
[3:23:17.080 --> 3:23:23.160]  on the main river near Frankfurt at the time. Its entire capital consisted of three horsepower steam
[3:23:23.160 --> 3:23:30.280]  engines, a small boiler in which they burnt arsenic acid and aniline oil, and they produced
[3:23:30.280 --> 3:23:35.960]  a synthetic fuchsia dye. That's where it all started. That's why we have pharma today.
[3:23:36.840 --> 3:23:42.680]  And before that, we used natural dyes, colors from plants and so forth. And so then we started
[3:23:42.680 --> 3:23:48.520]  changing it up. Well, IG Farben, Hoitzch, Bayer, all of those companies merged together to design
[3:23:48.520 --> 3:23:54.120]  pharmaceuticals and dangerous concoctions. And that's kind of where it started. Wellch went
[3:23:54.120 --> 3:23:59.480]  over to train with them in the latter part of the 1800s when they were doing some of their
[3:23:59.480 --> 3:24:06.120]  best work. Wellch, now the director of Johns Hopkins, would be instrumental in cementing the
[3:24:06.120 --> 3:24:10.600]  Rockefeller government-controlled healthcare right along with the introduction into pharma.
[3:24:10.600 --> 3:24:16.200]  And so, holistic medicines, natural remedies, they would start to get demonized in lieu of
[3:24:16.200 --> 3:24:22.280]  bringing pharma that would deliver these remedies that gave side effects and other illnesses.
[3:24:22.280 --> 3:24:28.360]  We would become the perpetual patient. Pharma was salivating at this. And so,
[3:24:28.360 --> 3:24:34.280]  the Flexner report of 1910 came out. It did the damage to holistic medicine and natural remedies
[3:24:35.160 --> 3:24:43.960]  and even marijuana, CBD. Abraham Flexner was told by John D. Rockefeller to run around the
[3:24:43.960 --> 3:24:49.480]  country and evaluate the effectiveness of all the therapies taught in medical schools and other
[3:24:49.480 --> 3:24:55.720]  institutions of the healing arts. And Rockefeller wanted to dominate over petroleum, petrochemicals
[3:24:55.720 --> 3:25:02.920]  and pharmaceuticals, which were derived from coltars or crude oil. And he arranged for his
[3:25:02.920 --> 3:25:09.160]  company Standard Oil of New Jersey. Did the name Bush come to mind? Senior Prescott Bush?
[3:25:09.160 --> 3:25:16.840]  Oh, anyway, Standard Oil. To obtain a controlling interest in this huge German drug cartel called
[3:25:16.840 --> 3:25:22.680]  IG-Farben. And the total number of medical schools in the United States went from 160
[3:25:22.680 --> 3:25:30.920]  on down to 69 schools. Why did it cut into about a third? Well, it was all about controlling the
[3:25:30.920 --> 3:25:37.160]  training of the doctors. The new foundation of orthodox medicine is based on Louis Pasteur's
[3:25:37.160 --> 3:25:43.000]  germ theory. It's completely flawed. And what it means is a disease condition is viewed by the
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:50.360]  orthodoxy as this isolated event, like an infection or a virus. And the new training of treatment
[3:25:50.360 --> 3:25:55.640]  would be chemical solution or surgery to cut it out. Alternative medicine had explored all these
[3:25:55.640 --> 3:26:02.120]  stressors and why it happened and treat the cause, right? It's all about health. So Welch was
[3:26:02.120 --> 3:26:08.040]  brought in. And I find this is so fascinating. Welch was brought in to help solve the problem
[3:26:08.040 --> 3:26:13.960]  of the 1918 Spanish flu. Remember when I mentioned that? The 1918 Spanish flu, where we conflated
[3:26:13.960 --> 3:26:19.160]  all the numbers over and over again in history. And now it's like triple quadruple the amount of
[3:26:19.160 --> 3:26:26.280]  deaths because we said that they didn't know how to count back in 1918. Well, it was neither Spanish
[3:26:26.280 --> 3:26:32.520]  nor a flu, really. It was the result of using troops as guinea pigs in the new vaccine experimental
[3:26:32.520 --> 3:26:41.080]  program that they had, which by the way, Welch served in the army. And then also he was the one
[3:26:41.080 --> 3:26:46.360]  guy that they brought in to help with what they were going to do regarding this issue. So the
[3:26:46.360 --> 3:26:52.520]  Spanish flu attacked healthy people in their prime. Bacterial pneumonia attacks people in their prime.
[3:26:52.520 --> 3:26:58.040]  And flu attacks the young, the old and those that are having problems with their immune system,
[3:26:58.040 --> 3:27:04.520]  right? So was it actually bacterial pneumonia? Was that the real killer? Given the fact that
[3:27:04.520 --> 3:27:12.600]  they did autopsies, they said possibly that was the case, just like it is now. Interesting. And much
[3:27:12.600 --> 3:27:18.040]  of the role that Welch played in that military program, you know, to vaccinate in Kansas,
[3:27:18.040 --> 3:27:24.520]  interesting that it started at a military base. So before nuclear weapons, all the chemical
[3:27:24.520 --> 3:27:32.040]  companies were the leading role. They're the ones that came out with mustard gas and Zyclon B and
[3:27:32.040 --> 3:27:39.480]  all of these different things that they used in World War Two, Hitler. That's why Hitler even came
[3:27:39.480 --> 3:27:47.160]  to power was because of IG Farman. And in 1925, it was decided that the chemical industry that we
[3:27:47.160 --> 3:27:56.920]  would have several cartels and and IG Farman became IG Farman. And Hitler would not have become Hitler
[3:27:56.920 --> 3:28:03.960]  without them. They financed him. And they made sure that he had all of the chemicals he needed.
[3:28:03.960 --> 3:28:10.360]  It's sick. It just makes me sick to think that we really didn't know what was going on behind the
[3:28:10.360 --> 3:28:17.640]  scenes. And these chemicals would be sadly used in the gas chambers. And so this is where the
[3:28:17.640 --> 3:28:25.800]  American IG Farman sector of IG Farman also takes root, too. This is where it got going here. We
[3:28:25.800 --> 3:28:31.960]  were under their umbrella. They had the patents. And so they did this through a Swiss company
[3:28:31.960 --> 3:28:38.680]  called IG Chemie to try to hide the fact that we were part of this, this German group who
[3:28:38.680 --> 3:28:44.680]  eventually faced conviction for war crimes against humanity. And then they served little time.
[3:28:46.040 --> 3:28:51.240]  I'll be right back. Kate Dally Show, KateDallyRadio.com. I'm live right after this. And you can catch
[3:28:51.240 --> 3:28:56.200]  my show at KateDallyRadio.com and listen live if you'd like. I'll be right back.
[3:29:00.200 --> 3:29:04.600]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me. And it makes me feel pathetic
[3:29:04.600 --> 3:29:10.920]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support,
[3:29:11.480 --> 3:29:16.280]  and for word of mouth. And we're all this together. And you know, it gets old having to come to you
[3:29:16.280 --> 3:29:20.040]  and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air. But it's true.
[3:29:20.040 --> 3:29:23.560]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[3:29:24.200 --> 3:29:28.520]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors. And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody
[3:29:28.520 --> 3:29:32.440]  else. They've crippled all the other groups. And we're still here. And as this whole new world
[3:29:32.440 --> 3:29:37.160]  order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up. That's why we've got to be taken
[3:29:37.160 --> 3:29:40.840]  off air. That's why America has got to be taken down. You can't have all these other nations
[3:29:40.840 --> 3:29:45.800]  enslaved and America still quasi free. You can't have info wars has been proven right,
[3:29:45.800 --> 3:29:50.600]  be on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold. Because if you think stuff's bad now,

[3:33:18.840 --> 3:33:23.880]  Hi, Kate Daly here from the Kate Daly show, your guest host for this hour. And let me tell you,
[3:33:23.880 --> 3:33:29.640]  when you kind of get the 30,000 feet up in the air sort of view on this,
[3:33:29.640 --> 3:33:35.240]  it's really quite scary how this became the cartel of the century. I don't know if we really
[3:33:35.240 --> 3:33:42.600]  realized it on where they took oil where they wanted it to go. These particular families whose
[3:33:42.600 --> 3:33:49.320]  names come up, you know, all the time over and over again. It's interesting that pharma became
[3:33:49.320 --> 3:33:56.200]  what it became. I think really without a lot of people realizing it at the time and for decades,
[3:33:56.200 --> 3:34:03.000]  which is really, really scary. IG Farben, who supplied the chemicals to the gas chambers
[3:34:04.680 --> 3:34:09.720]  and convicted of war crimes in which they, I think at the very, very most, they only served
[3:34:09.720 --> 3:34:16.120]  like four years. Then we got them out on Operation Paperclip. Interesting to come over here. But
[3:34:16.120 --> 3:34:23.160]  the IG Farben became a shareholder in the New Jersey oil standard oil company,
[3:34:23.160 --> 3:34:29.160]  second only to John D Rockefeller himself. And really when it comes down to it,
[3:34:29.160 --> 3:34:34.840]  Dolis was involved. Of course, Dolis was involved. I swear it's the same cast of characters over
[3:34:34.840 --> 3:34:41.080]  and over again. Dolis was personally threatening to cut off Britain's supply of oil during the war
[3:34:41.080 --> 3:34:47.000]  if the British persisted with their exposition of the American oil connection to IG Farben.
[3:34:47.000 --> 3:34:54.520]  It was all intertwined. And so what happened was nobody ever really asked the question of,
[3:34:54.520 --> 3:35:00.360]  why didn't the IG Farben building that was used, that everybody used in Germany during World War
[3:35:00.360 --> 3:35:05.800]  II, including us, why was it never bombed? How did, how did everybody escape that? Why did we
[3:35:05.800 --> 3:35:11.640]  make IG Farben command central for our military? And so here's another question. Why all the
[3:35:11.640 --> 3:35:19.160]  experimentation? Why did they do the experimentation that they did on people that they were forcing
[3:35:19.160 --> 3:35:24.600]  to do it on, right? During World War II. And why did Hitler do that? What was the goal?
[3:35:25.400 --> 3:35:32.280]  What was the goal? And so that industry had just begun, right? Pharma experimentations led to a
[3:35:32.280 --> 3:35:38.840]  huge explosion in pharma post World War II. But they never explained why. See, we never say,
[3:35:38.840 --> 3:35:44.200]  well, what caused that? It was caused through the experimentation. That's how sick and demented
[3:35:44.200 --> 3:35:52.280]  these people are. They wanted human guinea pigs. And you know, it makes me think about right now
[3:35:52.280 --> 3:35:58.920]  what's going on right now, demonizing the unvaxxed, right? And then we have the new dawning of
[3:35:58.920 --> 3:36:06.200]  transhumanism coming, DNA splicing and dicing, CRISPR. So would our fellow Americans allow this
[3:36:06.200 --> 3:36:11.960]  to happen to the unvaxxed? Because look at how they're demonized. We're really one step away.
[3:36:13.160 --> 3:36:19.400]  And a certain class of society gets demonized and experimented on with this brand new CRISPR.
[3:36:19.400 --> 3:36:21.880]  Is that where we're headed? And everyone turns a blind eye?
[3:36:21.880 --> 3:36:30.440]  It's really scary. And so at a time when our history, when we had great sanitation,
[3:36:30.440 --> 3:36:35.640]  we finally arrived, right? We had great sanitation, we had running water, we had all of these things
[3:36:35.640 --> 3:36:40.760]  because sanitation was the super spreader. Sanitation, I mean, vaccines get the credit
[3:36:40.760 --> 3:36:45.000]  because of the media and the government. But really and truly, it was sanitation,
[3:36:45.000 --> 3:36:49.560]  bad sanitation. And so you go all the way back to Moses, you're going to find that
[3:36:49.560 --> 3:36:57.720]  that he even had rules about about being in camp and cleanliness and things like that.
[3:36:57.720 --> 3:37:02.760]  And then after the fall of the Roman Empire, you notice that it completely kind of fell
[3:37:02.760 --> 3:37:07.800]  off for a while, didn't it? All throughout the medieval times. And they didn't, they didn't
[3:37:07.800 --> 3:37:12.280]  really keep up on it. I'll say that nicely, because people just didn't shower. There just
[3:37:12.280 --> 3:37:21.160]  wasn't that same understanding. Okay. And so what happened? Well, sanitation became wonderful.
[3:37:21.160 --> 3:37:27.160]  So why is it that all of a sudden, think about this, we had to have big pharma come in with
[3:37:27.160 --> 3:37:32.840]  all their chemicals, erase holistic medicine, erase natural medicines, and then all of a sudden,
[3:37:33.400 --> 3:37:38.600]  we're sitting on on more sick people, right? We have more sick people around the world than
[3:37:38.600 --> 3:37:45.160]  we've ever had before. Makes zero sense. We finally get the good sanitation. We finally get to a point
[3:37:45.160 --> 3:37:50.440]  where, yes, we should be actually without a lot of disease and illness at this point,
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:57.480]  especially spreading it. But we're not. Now we're, we have more cancer, we have more disease,
[3:37:57.480 --> 3:38:04.520]  we have more illness than ever. It doesn't make any sense. And so after World War II,
[3:38:04.520 --> 3:38:09.880]  they said that there was this huge explosion of, of, of illness, right, and disease.
[3:38:10.840 --> 3:38:15.080]  Were they toying with antibiotics at this point? Yeah. Could you make the argument
[3:38:15.080 --> 3:38:20.920]  that some antibiotics might help? Well, what are they doing? What are they doing inside effects
[3:38:20.920 --> 3:38:26.360]  to the rest of our body? Do we ever even ask that? They're using these synthetic chemicals,
[3:38:26.360 --> 3:38:33.000]  right? And so we never asked, well, what caused polio to spike? What caused it to spike? Well,
[3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:37.960]  they were using DDT on the crops, they were spraying poisons, and then also they were toying
[3:38:37.960 --> 3:38:43.880]  with antibiotics. I would say two good reasons right there to chalk it up to, hey, we see all
[3:38:43.880 --> 3:38:52.760]  the sudden spike in polio where there shouldn't be one. And so, so then only about 0.5% of people
[3:38:52.760 --> 3:38:59.000]  died from actual polio. I covered this a couple weeks ago, right? Only 0.5% were actually paralyzed.
[3:38:59.000 --> 3:39:04.280]  That's a whole 1%. What about everybody else? 99%. Well, it's a little like what we're dealing with
[3:39:04.280 --> 3:39:10.840]  today. Most everybody gets a cold and they don't freak out. They're not going to die. Only a certain
[3:39:10.840 --> 3:39:17.720]  small sliver in every single state, you're going to have people that are more sick than that. Then
[3:39:17.720 --> 3:39:26.680]  they go in for the, for the Fauci special, the protocol from hell and killing them. Uh-huh.
[3:39:26.680 --> 3:39:32.920]  Uh-huh. Yeah. That's exactly what they're doing, giving them experimental drugs. They're really good
[3:39:32.920 --> 3:39:40.360]  at it. They've had really a century and 20 some odd years to work on it, haven't they? So now we
[3:39:40.360 --> 3:39:45.480]  are looking at this kind of situation and saying, well, wait a second, with polio, did we really
[3:39:45.480 --> 3:39:51.320]  need a vaccination? It was already on its way out. There had been a decade of it. So why were we
[3:39:51.320 --> 3:39:56.760]  doing that? Why were we jumping to this vaccination? Well, it involved a lot of government money.
[3:39:56.760 --> 3:40:01.880]  Government money started coming in and supporting these vaccination programs. So
[3:40:03.160 --> 3:40:08.120]  they, they, they give us the fear, right? The big boogie man. Oh my gosh, everyone's going to die.
[3:40:08.120 --> 3:40:12.920]  Every child out there is going to be paralyzed. Parents run the kids in for the shots. The only
[3:40:12.920 --> 3:40:20.120]  problem is, is that half of the shots that were given out at the time were infected with the
[3:40:20.120 --> 3:40:27.560]  SV-40. The monkey kidney cell, uh, diseased, uh, shots that they didn't want to admit to,
[3:40:27.560 --> 3:40:33.240]  but they knew full well, uh, that they were diseased. So it's interesting that they use
[3:40:33.240 --> 3:40:40.840]  the exact same, almost exact same percentage on this to sell what was coming next. Smallpox as
[3:40:40.840 --> 3:40:47.720]  well, um, with good sanitation, you weren't going to see a lot of smallpox. Um, the 1918 flu
[3:40:47.720 --> 3:40:53.960]  result of vaccinations at, of course, military bases where they knew they could use all of these
[3:40:53.960 --> 3:40:59.000]  guys as guinea pigs because they had complete control over them. Are we seeing a pattern?
[3:40:59.640 --> 3:41:04.120]  Then you get to polio and all of a sudden there's something new to work on folks.
[3:41:04.120 --> 3:41:09.560]  So they start working on it. And just as it's starting to wane, um, and by the way,
[3:41:09.560 --> 3:41:15.800]  the polio vaccine was causing so many cases of polio, an incredible amount of cases of polio
[3:41:15.800 --> 3:41:24.680]  still is to this day. I just asked Bill Gates. So then we start kind of having this quest of
[3:41:24.680 --> 3:41:31.480]  vaccination programs, shop programs for kids, right? You go in and you get a series of shots,
[3:41:31.480 --> 3:41:38.840]  the well visits, a well visit. What in the hell is that? You go to the doctor when you're ill,
[3:41:38.840 --> 3:41:45.640]  not when you're well, and you go in for all of these shots. I look at vaccines much differently
[3:41:45.640 --> 3:41:52.120]  on understanding the history of all of this than I ever did before. And what did we do? We do this
[3:41:52.120 --> 3:41:58.760]  whole, uh, you know, vaccinations are the only thing that has saved us. Why do we say that?
[3:41:59.800 --> 3:42:03.160]  Well, because they own the media and the government. That's why
[3:42:03.960 --> 3:42:10.200]  pharma gets fed. Pharma gets fed a lot of illness for all the vaccinations part of a,
[3:42:10.200 --> 3:42:16.520]  uh, uh, you know, let's get the immune system down. Cause I'll tell you the big mantra of the
[3:42:16.520 --> 3:42:22.680]  Rockefellers was you don't have an immune system. Pharma's here to save you. Ooh,
[3:42:22.680 --> 3:42:31.720]  don't you feel all warm and cozy? Pharma's here. Wow. So yeah, it gets worse too. I'll come back,
[3:42:31.720 --> 3:42:37.800]  I'll explain, but, uh, yeah, half the country got infected kidney cells in that polio vaccine,
[3:42:37.800 --> 3:42:43.240]  and then what came around the next corner, more cancer than ever. And Nixon declared that war
[3:42:43.240 --> 3:42:47.720]  on cancer. And that's why I wanted to revisit that that I did a couple of weeks ago because
[3:42:47.720 --> 3:42:53.560]  it plays into this. Now we get to see it from a whole different vantage point of the plans.
[3:42:53.560 --> 3:42:57.480]  I'll be right back. Kate Daly, your guest host, Kate Daly show, KateDalyRadio.com.

[3:44:02.040 --> 3:44:09.240]  scientists discovered and were able to isolate a compound that is naturally in nature and in foods
[3:44:09.240 --> 3:44:16.120]  we eat but in very, very low amounts. It's called PQQ or bio PQQ. When you have the organic form
[3:44:16.120 --> 3:44:21.560]  of it, it does amazing things. It actually makes your telomeres last longer. It doesn't make them
[3:44:21.560 --> 3:44:26.360]  grow but makes them last longer. This basically the same thing. So it's as close to the fountain of

[3:45:02.920 --> 3:45:10.760]  explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet
[3:45:10.760 --> 3:45:16.920]  by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.

[3:46:25.320 --> 3:46:29.800]  or designed to do that, we have had real problems getting our best-selling products in. Some of
[3:46:29.800 --> 3:46:34.920]  them take up to 10 months to get in. We've had to discontinue some of our products because we just
[3:46:34.920 --> 3:46:40.600]  can't get the ingredients anymore. It's pretty scary stuff. So please take advantage of sales

[3:47:22.120 --> 3:47:25.640]  Hi there, welcome back. I'm going to do the white man Oprah by it.
[3:47:28.440 --> 3:47:34.680]  Anyway, coming back to this, I just kind of wanted to round up the edges a little bit on this
[3:47:34.680 --> 3:47:40.680]  and what we're dealing with today because this is huge. And once you start to see what's actually
[3:47:40.680 --> 3:47:48.200]  happening, then you get a good idea of the whole picture. And that's really what is dividing Americans.
[3:47:48.200 --> 3:47:54.040]  This is why you have two totally different sets of fears. One group over here, these leftists,
[3:47:54.040 --> 3:47:58.360]  think everyone in the world's about to kill them. The climate's going to kill them. And we have
[3:47:58.360 --> 3:48:03.080]  conservatives over here and people over here that understand the big picture know who's at the helm
[3:48:03.640 --> 3:48:08.520]  and they're saying you are a walking bio weapon. So two totally different schools of thought, right?
[3:48:09.480 --> 3:48:16.920]  Well, we are not meant to ever cure anyone or help anyone or make sure that they stay healthy.
[3:48:16.920 --> 3:48:21.560]  That's why it's the Center for Disease Control, not the Center for Curing Disease.
[3:48:23.880 --> 3:48:31.240]  That's a big statement. It says a lot that we have been guinea pigs for over 100 years
[3:48:31.240 --> 3:48:38.280]  in their game in their cartel. And you find it rather disturbing that about 80% of our country
[3:48:38.280 --> 3:48:44.680]  is on at least one pharmaceutical and that the government turned their attention to mental health
[3:48:44.680 --> 3:48:50.280]  and a whole plethora of drugs. Drugging everybody up. We're drugging kids from the time they're
[3:48:50.280 --> 3:48:56.920]  little, right? Everything has a drug. Just here you go. Here's a fix it. And doctors doing what
[3:48:56.920 --> 3:49:04.600]  doctors do and just handing over a script instead of saying what causes that. Why are we here?
[3:49:04.600 --> 3:49:10.920]  What is the main mechanism that's causing whatever the problem is? We didn't have childhood cancer
[3:49:10.920 --> 3:49:18.200]  in the 1800s like we have right now. We didn't have melanoma cancer go through the roof until
[3:49:18.200 --> 3:49:24.440]  they encouraged everybody to wear sunscreen from the AMA in the 70s. If you go look at the chart,
[3:49:24.440 --> 3:49:28.360]  and I actually say, you know, go do your own homework on this, I've looked at these charts,
[3:49:28.360 --> 3:49:33.320]  the numbers skyrocketed the minute they said go wear sunscreen. Think about this. People were
[3:49:33.320 --> 3:49:38.680]  out in their fields all the time, right? For centuries. You weren't dying of melanoma.
[3:49:38.680 --> 3:49:46.440]  Of course they weren't. And so all of a sudden we had skin cancer go through the roof. It was like
[3:49:47.080 --> 3:49:53.240]  two or one in every 100,000 people and then it ballooned almost 50 in every 100,000 people.
[3:49:53.240 --> 3:50:01.560]  That's crazy. And then doctors are now trained to embrace pharma. They sell pharma. They get
[3:50:01.560 --> 3:50:07.240]  kickbacks from pharma. They get kickbacks for the vaccine industry too. And so pharma is the
[3:50:07.240 --> 3:50:13.640]  biggest cartel the world has ever known. And by the way, the AMA was found guilty in 1987
[3:50:13.640 --> 3:50:19.720]  by a federal judge and fined a couple of million dollars. Also pharma has even been sued by our
[3:50:19.720 --> 3:50:24.920]  own government and of course the source of corruption for many failed experiments that
[3:50:24.920 --> 3:50:32.440]  they've done and also lying through their teeth again and again and again. Fauci's lied so many
[3:50:32.440 --> 3:50:36.840]  times that I can't keep up with the lies. I don't know why anyone in their right mind would
[3:50:36.840 --> 3:50:43.880]  actually listen to this hack. The Rockefeller drug ideology is all about you don't have an
[3:50:43.880 --> 3:50:49.000]  immune system and right now this is exactly what they've said for the last 20 months. You have no
[3:50:49.000 --> 3:50:54.600]  immune system. Everybody's went to kaput. Nobody has it anymore and you're screwed. So you have to
[3:50:54.600 --> 3:51:01.240]  take these experimental medications for the mystery COVID bug that's killing everybody, right? Isn't
[3:51:01.240 --> 3:51:05.320]  that what they tell you? Have you ever actually heard the word immune system come out of Fauci's
[3:51:05.320 --> 3:51:11.160]  mouth or a doctor or anyone that is proposing all of this crazy? Of course you haven't.
[3:51:12.200 --> 3:51:18.040]  And Rockefeller had always had this particular interest in China and standard oil was the sole
[3:51:18.040 --> 3:51:24.280]  supplier of kerosene and oil for the lamps of China. And then of course communism took over so
[3:51:24.280 --> 3:51:29.400]  they kind of went out for a while but oh they're back in. Are you kidding me? Of course they are
[3:51:29.400 --> 3:51:37.000]  and we all know that. Fauci was a big deal for Wuhan and funding it and everything else. So
[3:51:38.760 --> 3:51:48.360]  that brings us to Bill Gates, biggest single donor of WHO, the WHO. The AMA Vets who runs the FDA.
[3:51:49.240 --> 3:51:55.960]  Almost all the experts on COVID come from Johns Hopkins. All the experts in public health come
[3:51:55.960 --> 3:52:04.520]  from Johns Hopkins. Isn't it amazing? And no epidemics to justify it. So they use the tricks
[3:52:04.520 --> 3:52:10.680]  of going in and solving a problem that's pretty much solvable by telling you how important they
[3:52:10.680 --> 3:52:17.240]  are and how they're saving humanity because it's always going to get the credit. And then of course
[3:52:17.240 --> 3:52:22.600]  they named them after foreign countries, the Hong Kong flu, the Asian flu, all of these different
[3:52:22.600 --> 3:52:29.800]  flus. Well the problem is that they're all flu. Just like just like pneumonia is pneumonia. You're
[3:52:29.800 --> 3:52:34.280]  going to treat it as a respiratory. You're going to treat it as a flu. But they named them from
[3:52:34.280 --> 3:52:39.400]  foreign places. Why? Because well you know you might need more shots. You might need more. Do
[3:52:39.400 --> 3:52:44.520]  you feel like cattle? Do you feel like we should be told to start mooing here? I mean that's the
[3:52:44.520 --> 3:52:50.440]  feeling I'm getting with the amount of shots they want us to take coming up here in the future.
[3:52:50.440 --> 3:52:56.840]  And so a simple cold flu and pneumonia all given the COVID label and money comes now from our tax
[3:52:56.840 --> 3:53:01.880]  dollars funded to pharma. Pharma now is in complete control. So is the government of all of our
[3:53:01.880 --> 3:53:08.520]  hospitals with their protocols. And they relieve them beyond malpractice with their protocols.
[3:53:09.080 --> 3:53:13.640]  So if you follow the protocol and you're a hospital and a doctor, you have no liability
[3:53:13.640 --> 3:53:20.360]  because malpractice only covers you to a certain extent. And then we have the statements of
[3:53:20.360 --> 3:53:28.200]  you know you anti-vaxxer. That derogatory statement. Oh you anti-vaxxer. Oh my gosh I sure hope we're
[3:53:28.200 --> 3:53:37.320]  questioning it at this point 120 years later. Please. Good heavens. We are the experimentation
[3:53:37.320 --> 3:53:42.760]  and we have been for 120 years. And that's the tough part. That's the tough part to understand.
[3:53:42.760 --> 3:53:46.920]  But you know truth resonates and once you start seeing this for what it is and the cartel that
[3:53:46.920 --> 3:53:54.120]  it is and how they colluded to control medicine and to control what the doctors did and what they
[3:53:54.120 --> 3:53:59.720]  didn't and to carve out not a niche for themselves but complete and utter control. You start to see
[3:53:59.720 --> 3:54:07.640]  it completely different right. Gosh I would hope so. You know we're in a a weird place and by the
[3:54:07.640 --> 3:54:12.120]  way all these notes will be on KateDallyRadio.com. You can go check out the notes and all the credit
[3:54:12.120 --> 3:54:18.280]  given to all the different sources. That will be up today on KateDallyRadio.com. Check it out and
[3:54:18.280 --> 3:54:23.000]  you can send that as well. But you know the thing with the airlines I just wanted to mention you
[3:54:23.000 --> 3:54:28.920]  know Southwest and Southwest good on you guys. I love you guys for standing up for freedom.
[3:54:28.920 --> 3:54:36.760]  I love it and boy everybody should be following this in suits. So I just wanted to say that
[3:54:36.760 --> 3:54:42.840]  they're using the government right now by saying we're a government contractor. We're a government
[3:54:42.840 --> 3:54:51.720]  contractor. When you when you are Southwest Airlines and you give flights to federal employees
[3:54:51.720 --> 3:54:58.040]  that does not make you now an employee of the federal government. It means that you did something
[3:54:58.040 --> 3:55:03.560]  with the federal government okay but it doesn't make you an employee. Who signs the checks? Who
[3:55:03.560 --> 3:55:09.880]  signs the checks? Well Southwest signs their checks right. They are not a government entity. The checks
[3:55:09.880 --> 3:55:15.320]  are not written from the federal government. But the reason that they're saying that is so that
[3:55:15.320 --> 3:55:21.400]  nobody figures out that last year in 2020 they actually when they were doing the bailouts they
[3:55:21.400 --> 3:55:27.720]  sought to control three industries. And so in before when they did bailouts they never actually
[3:55:27.720 --> 3:55:32.760]  assumed ownership the government to a certain extent but they did in those bailouts. But they
[3:55:32.760 --> 3:55:38.440]  want to keep that quiet because it's very Venezuela. It's very socialist right to have your government
[3:55:38.440 --> 3:55:46.280]  own the airlines the hospitals and trucking. So what they what they're saying is is oh yeah we're
[3:55:46.280 --> 3:55:52.520]  a we we have to mask. We're a we're a government entity. We're a we're a government employee.
[3:55:52.520 --> 3:55:58.120]  We're included on that EO. It's almost like they want to be. Have you noticed? And so of course
[3:55:58.120 --> 3:56:03.960]  the Southwest CEO will stand there and say I'm all for freedom. I don't want to force anything but
[3:56:03.960 --> 3:56:09.880]  I kind of want to pretend I'm a federal employee so that I can mask my employees by force. And
[3:56:09.880 --> 3:56:18.040]  not very American thing to do is it. It's very very socialist. Very communist. And so the EO
[3:56:18.040 --> 3:56:25.880]  itself does not actually say government contractors in it. And now we don't even have any written
[3:56:25.880 --> 3:56:33.720]  anything that says that any company over 100 has to get get vaccinated. It was a press release. We
[3:56:33.720 --> 3:56:39.160]  all know that. And and so it's all smoke and mirrors. It's all smoke and mirrors. And they do
[3:56:39.160 --> 3:56:43.640]  want to hide the fact that the government did take a part ownership in their business as well
[3:56:43.640 --> 3:56:48.520]  and gives them a lot of funding. So you always have to follow the money. But I always find it
[3:56:48.520 --> 3:56:52.200]  kind of interesting when they're out in the press and they're giving you the a little bit of the
[3:56:52.200 --> 3:56:57.480]  run around right so that you don't see what's actually going on behind the scenes and also
[3:56:57.480 --> 3:57:02.920]  claiming something that they actually are not. It's pathetic. Stand up and be an American.
[3:57:03.480 --> 3:57:09.240]  You are an American soil. You are an American. Start acting like it. Southwest Airlines and
[3:57:09.240 --> 3:57:17.080]  American and United. You know I believe in this country and I know you do too. We love this country
[3:57:17.080 --> 3:57:23.400]  and we're not going to let it get it overrun by these cockroaches. We're just not. So thanks for
