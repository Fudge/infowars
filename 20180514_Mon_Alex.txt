[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, the 14th day of May 2018.
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.000]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.000]  And then Roger Stone and Troyer are going to knock it out of the park yet again.
[00:38.000 --> 00:47.000]  We've got 43 dead thousands injured in Islamist rioting outside of Israel.
[00:47.000 --> 00:50.000]  And that's what it is.
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.000]  Doesn't mean I don't feel for some of those people locked out of all the other Muslim countries
[00:55.000 --> 00:58.000]  who won't take a single one of them, but only blame Israel.
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  It's just not reality based.
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.000]  And I'm going to break it all down.
[01:02.000 --> 01:03.000]  Jared Kushner can speak.
[01:03.000 --> 01:04.000]  He actually talks.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  He says Trump's kept his promises.
[01:08.000 --> 01:09.000]  Amazing footage.
[01:09.000 --> 01:11.000]  Drones dropping tear gas on people.
[01:11.000 --> 01:13.000]  I remember I told folks about that 10 years ago.
[01:13.000 --> 01:15.000]  They said it was a conspiracy theory, but now it's all there.
[01:15.000 --> 01:24.000]  But first a John Bowne report because we have to understand we're leftist ideology takes us 1,000% of the time.
[01:24.000 --> 01:40.000]  California with its bankrupt economy, culture of unemployment, madcap representatives, crumbling power grid, crippling taxes and unattainable real estate prices has created an exodus of Californians heading east.
[01:40.000 --> 01:44.000]  But California has always claimed to be at the heart of the American future.
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  So why is everyone leaving?
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  Curbed reports.
[01:48.000 --> 01:57.000]  California is seeing a net gain in high earners making $110,000 or more and the highly educated graduate degrees or higher.
[01:57.000 --> 02:05.000]  While losing those representing the other end of the socioeconomic spectrum, families with kids are headed for Texas.
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  Blue state college graduates are moving in.
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.000]  In other words, California is experiencing what looks like statewide gentrification.
[02:13.000 --> 02:23.000]  Maybe it's also because of the leftist madness gleaned from reports like these as the LA Times asked, is systematic racism to blame for STDs?
[02:23.000 --> 02:31.000]  They write, poverty or lack of opportunity may be forcing women to exchange sex for resources leading to the spread of STDs.
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  There also tends to be a mistrust of the medical system among African Americans making them reluctant to seek care.
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  Lately, scapegoating racism has been the trojan horse for all of society's ills.
[02:42.000 --> 02:51.000]  What else could explain, as the Washington Times reported over half of Americans now live in sanctuaries protecting illegal non-tax paying immigrants?
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  And as the wealth gap increases, is this what you can expect coming soon to a city near you?
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.000]  New at 5, we have shocking video of what's going on in one of the busiest BART stations in the Bay Area.
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.000]  Several junkies blatantly shooting up out in the open.
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  Others slumped along the corridors.
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  This is San Francisco's Civic Center station.
[03:12.000 --> 03:19.000]  We sent KPI X5's Wilson Walker to ask the mayor and BART, what are you doing about all of this?
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  You can see there's dozens of them, needles everywhere, crack, heroin.
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  It's a real concern for our writers and we appreciate that.
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  What we have to do is make the most of the resources, the limited resources that we have.
[03:31.000 --> 03:34.000]  They got me clear the stairs!
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  BART, which has been pledging to address these problems, says it's recruiting more community service officers,
[03:39.000 --> 03:45.000]  more than 30 new sworn officers and 20 new station cleaners, but will that be enough?
[03:45.000 --> 03:51.000]  If San Francisco spends nearly a quarter of a billion dollars on the homeless every year,
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.000]  why are there still thousands of people living on the street?
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.000]  Where does that money go and how does the system work or not work?
[03:58.000 --> 04:08.000]  $241 million. Now of that, 50 million funds shelters and another 50 million fund health services for the truly homeless.
[04:08.000 --> 04:19.000]  But the single most important thing to know about that $241 million is that most of it has absolutely nothing to do with the people we see on the streets.
[04:19.000 --> 04:24.000]  That is a great observation. I think it's missed by many in the city.
[04:24.000 --> 04:30.000]  We're spending $241 million a year on the seven or eight thousand people who are homeless in San Francisco.
[04:30.000 --> 04:35.000]  We're spending more than half of that money actually to keep people in permanent housing.
[04:35.000 --> 04:43.000]  That's right. $140 million worth of the entire homeless budget houses approximately 9,000 people.
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  California should be the prime example of what not to do.
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.000]  John Bown reporting for Infowars.com.
[04:51.000 --> 05:00.000]  We'll be back on this Live Monday Global Transmission. Please spread all the live links and tell folks about your local station.

[06:21.000 --> 06:48.000]  You know, I've had the Islamist grips, I've had the white supremacist, I've had the Hollywood crowd, I've had mainstream media bully me for 20-plus years that I've been on air.
[06:48.000 --> 07:00.000]  With litmus test about do I support Israel or don't I? And I've been very, very clear that I do support Israel.
[07:00.000 --> 07:10.000]  There's videos on YouTube that have been re-uploaded where I said that in 1997.
[07:10.000 --> 07:36.000]  And the reason I do is very simple. None of the Muslim countries like Egypt or Jordan or Saudi Arabia that surround the Palestinian lands, close quote, will take any of them.
[07:36.000 --> 07:40.000]  And I've gone and looked at the demographics of most of those people.
[07:40.000 --> 07:52.000]  They're basically nomadic groups that have come into the area as part of a hajj or part of some type of jihad.
[07:52.000 --> 08:07.000]  Now let's explain this. Israel's this little bitty tiny country. All around it are these Muslim countries.
[08:07.000 --> 08:17.000]  And if you look at maps going back 100 years ago, time lapse through today, big magazines have done them, TV stations have done them, news programs have done them.
[08:17.000 --> 08:27.000]  They generally show Islam spreading as green because that's the color of Islam and you see it expanding, never contracting.
[08:27.000 --> 08:42.000]  And you've got one point, almost four billion Muslims having six children on average, that means three billion by 2030, 2030.
[08:42.000 --> 08:54.000]  So within about 12 years, hard to believe 2030 is only 12 years away. Wow. Isn't that incredible? We're living in the future here.
[08:54.000 --> 09:19.000]  And the left and the globalist have allied themselves with radical Islam and they've backed to take over non radical Islam and persecute Muslims and then persecute Christians and persecute animus and persecute Zoroastrians and Hindus and Buddhists and atheists and straight and gay.
[09:19.000 --> 09:33.000]  All over the world, Islam comes in, sets up and then once it hits about 20%, it does not tolerate anybody else. In fact, it doesn't tolerate more moderate Islamic groups.
[09:33.000 --> 09:41.000]  It's a scourge. And you read the WikiLeaks from two years ago, Jerusalem Post even had to report on it.
[09:41.000 --> 09:56.000]  Boy, the Israeli media is just as leftist as ours tries to cover stuff up that George Soros basically wants to break up Israel and end it, get rid of it.
[09:56.000 --> 10:02.000]  What are you going to do with those millions of Jews that are there? Just push them into the ocean like Iran says?
[10:02.000 --> 10:13.000]  And you've got the 13th tribe, you know, Kessler arguments that have been proven not to be completely accurate and say, well, most of them are European Jews, so they don't really have some genetic background.
[10:13.000 --> 10:28.000]  Oh, yes, they do. It may be a small genetic background, but it doesn't even matter. Jews were there thousands of years ago and the idea that the whole Middle East can't have any Jews in it is the exact same idea that you can't be any Christians.
[10:28.000 --> 10:47.000]  Except where? Syria and Iraq and Egypt and Libya. And what did Barack Hussein Obama, Barack Hussein Obama, who wears his little Islam ring with Arabic on it?
[10:47.000 --> 10:59.000]  The first foreign speech he gave was in Cairo. It's like he's an Imam. He speaks Arabic perfectly.
[10:59.000 --> 11:17.000]  There is no place for Christians all over the world from Indonesia to Nigeria, black Christians, black Ethiopian Christians, Sudanese Christians in countries that were 95% Christian.
[11:17.000 --> 11:30.000]  Just 100 years ago, the Christians are being completely pushed out and slaughtered. So here's the coup de grace.
[11:30.000 --> 11:38.000]  I don't say these things about Israel to curry favor with the anti-Israel crowd. I say it because I like to give a full spectrum analysis.
[11:38.000 --> 11:48.000]  I don't like some of the globalist and leftist groups that basically use Israel as a place to launder money and to manipulate influence and to escape criminal actions here in the U.S.
[11:48.000 --> 12:00.000]  I don't like some of the leftist Israel lobby being involved in anti-gun movements here in the U.S. when they are handing out M16s and Uzi's to their people, which they should.
[12:00.000 --> 12:09.000]  I've got issues with Israel, but Israel is a diverse political system.
[12:09.000 --> 12:21.000]  Israel is not expanding and telling me I can't have a church on my street. Israel is not telling me that my children have to submit to Allah.
[12:21.000 --> 12:38.000]  Israel is not spreading like a virus. And George Soros, my enemy, the guy trying to destroy me, trying to overthrow this country, the Nazi collaborator.
[12:38.000 --> 12:48.000]  No matter how many newspapers and publications he pays to call himself a Holocaust survivor, he went on 60 Minutes and he wrote a book and so did his dad, bragging how they helped round up thousands of Jews,
[12:48.000 --> 12:56.000]  saying it was the best time of their life and they do it all over again. Do I have to play 60 Minutes for you again?
[12:56.000 --> 13:06.000]  He's after me and they basically told me in the lawsuits and in the news, stop doing this. I will never stop.
[13:06.000 --> 13:17.000]  You may be able to intimidate and push other people around, buddy. You're not pushing me around.
[13:17.000 --> 13:27.000]  So it's called choosing a side and there's big money behind being anti-Israel.
[13:27.000 --> 13:42.000]  I didn't even try to appease the anti-Israel crowd when I made a film about the USS Liberty and concluded it was a false flag between Israel and LBJ to start a war.
[13:42.000 --> 13:54.000]  LBJ done false flags before. It made the anti-Israel crowd even matter, saying I wasn't a pure Jew hater and I wasn't pure like them and all of their BS.
[13:54.000 --> 14:01.000]  I put that film out because if I'm going to expose false flags, that is an interesting and important one to make.
[14:01.000 --> 14:16.000]  And I interviewed Admiral Moore, who was the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman and others before he died and I interviewed the head Judge Advocate General on the case to actually find out what happened 20 years ago.
[14:16.000 --> 14:23.000]  Before your average anti-Israel person even knew about the Liberty, I'd had dozens of guests on about it, but that isn't the issue.
[14:23.000 --> 14:30.000]  It's like if the US government does something evil or bad, is every administration evil? Is our whole government bad? No.
[14:30.000 --> 14:52.000]  So, all the bullying over the years, all the anti-Israel stuff, all of it is all part of a larger globalist UN sorosian program and the Vatican is heavily involved and they want the UN to come in and take over that holy city.
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.000]  Talk about bringing in revelation.
[14:56.000 --> 15:02.000]  You know, maybe I just don't want revelation to come in that quick. I got a one-year-old daughter. I got three other children I love.
[15:02.000 --> 15:11.000]  Maybe I just don't like seeing it fulfilled to have the Babylon whore and the false prophet in control of Jerusalem.
[15:11.000 --> 15:20.000]  Maybe just at a deep level, I don't like the UN taking control of Israel because that's the thing. That's who's going to take it over and then they're going to start even bigger wars.
[15:20.000 --> 15:28.000]  They'll never satisfy the so-called Palestinians. The Arab countries won't take one of them. What does that tell you? Because everywhere you take a man, they try to overthrow you.
[15:28.000 --> 15:44.000]  It's what they do. And the suicide bombings with their kids and all of this crud and the fact that they're invading our countries and the globalists are bringing them in to our nations and telling us we've got a red carpet to them.
[15:44.000 --> 15:54.000]  And I've got articles here where they're telling churches take down their steeples, take down their crosses in Germany that you can't have your church bells going at half the decimals of the call to prayer.
[15:54.000 --> 16:18.000]  But the call to prayer can happen. Christians are under attack.
[16:18.000 --> 16:28.000]  The call to prayer can happen.
[16:48.000 --> 16:58.000]  The call to prayer can happen.
[17:18.000 --> 17:40.000]  This is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[17:40.000 --> 18:00.000]  The call to prayer can happen.
[18:00.000 --> 18:10.000]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[18:10.000 --> 18:36.000]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[18:36.000 --> 18:43.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[18:51.000 --> 19:00.000]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com.
[19:00.000 --> 19:06.000]  Infowarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block.
[19:06.000 --> 19:18.000]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[19:18.000 --> 19:27.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[19:27.000 --> 19:38.000]  Again, studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[19:38.000 --> 19:42.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[19:42.000 --> 19:52.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[19:55.000 --> 20:00.000]  Visit infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[20:25.000 --> 20:30.000]  It is The Alex Jones Show.
[20:55.000 --> 21:02.000]  In Hollywood, there's a litmus test with George Soros. There's a litmus test with the radical Islamic groups of hating Israel.
[21:02.000 --> 21:14.000]  But never looking at the mass murder Hillary and Obama cause by fighting the Arab Spring and overthrowing non-radical regimes and our allies and putting radical Islam in.
[21:14.000 --> 21:23.000]  There are different maps of what the universities have put out, but if you type in the spread of Islam worldwide map, you'll get a lot of different variants and versions.
[21:23.000 --> 21:28.000]  And you'll see that Islam is expanding.
[21:28.000 --> 21:39.000]  Islam is not contracting. Christianity is contracting. Capitalism is contracting. Prosperity is contracting.
[21:39.000 --> 21:50.000]  And when Islam takes over your country, it doesn't let you continue to be free.
[21:50.000 --> 21:56.000]  All it does is expand.
[21:56.000 --> 22:02.000]  There are countries that are currently Islamic and there are countries that are currently not Islamic.
[22:02.000 --> 22:08.000]  There is the house of Islam. There is the house of war.
[22:08.000 --> 22:16.000]  Islam is already in control of most European countries because they're parliamentary with more than 10 parties per country.
[22:16.000 --> 22:27.000]  You get 10, 15% that vote in a block. You have checkmate control already.
[22:27.000 --> 22:33.000]  Understand that, ladies and gentlemen, there's a devastating world map.
[22:33.000 --> 22:38.000]  If you're a radio listener in FullWars.com, you can see this for yourself.
[22:38.000 --> 22:45.000]  But this is the reality.
[22:45.000 --> 22:53.000]  Now, does that mean Israel is perfect? Absolutely not.
[22:53.000 --> 23:01.000]  Does that mean that Netanyahu has been caught along with Obama funding ISIS and al-Qaeda as one of the warring groups trying to bring down Syria?
[23:01.000 --> 23:04.000]  And I get the Machiavellian view.
[23:04.000 --> 23:10.000]  Well, Syria has been our enemy for 50 years and if we can take out Assad, we're not going to let al-Qaeda stay in charge.
[23:10.000 --> 23:12.000]  We'll obviously then put another regime in.
[23:12.000 --> 23:21.000]  What, after ISIS and al-Qaeda kill hundreds of thousands of innocent people? That's wrong, BB.
[23:21.000 --> 23:27.000]  But I say that from a position of moral authority in that I don't hate Netanyahu because he's a Jew.
[23:27.000 --> 23:31.000]  And I don't think Netanyahu overall is a bad guy that you really believe in Israel.
[23:31.000 --> 23:35.000]  He's a hard-working, focused person.
[23:35.000 --> 23:39.000]  But he's got blinders on for Israel and that's what he's elected to do.
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.000]  And the globalists are trying to take him out of office just like Trump.
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  But I'll say this.
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.000]  Trump is a leader. And Netanyahu said that and it's absolutely true.
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  Trump is a leader. This is called leadership, folks.
[23:53.000 --> 23:58.000]  This is called not doing the same thing, beating your head up against the wall for 50 years in a failed peace deal.
[23:58.000 --> 24:02.000]  While the Palestinians sit across the fence having six kids on average.
[24:02.000 --> 24:09.000]  And not one Arab country will take them because they use them that big lake of humanity as a weapon system.
[24:09.000 --> 24:14.000]  Incredible footage I saw today of Israel dropping tear gas on people from drones.
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  Can we roll that? It was on CNN.
[24:16.000 --> 24:28.000]  And I remember seeing that and I just remember being criticized 10 years ago saying,
[24:28.000 --> 24:34.000]  oh look, this company's selling drones to drop tear gas and fire weapons, including hand grenades.
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  And the media attacked me and said, Jones is insane.
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  There's no plan to use drones to surveil rural property.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  There's no plans to put weapons on them or tear gas.
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.000]  And I remember it was in over a thousand newspapers.
[24:49.000 --> 24:55.000]  It was the first time I was really hit with a full disinformation piece.
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  And all I was doing was reading out of regional newspapers.
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  But they didn't want to have a national debate about that.
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  It's just so funny. It's like Jade Helm.
[25:03.000 --> 25:06.000]  It was in the Houston Chronicle, the awesome American states from the Miami Herald.
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  It was in so many papers. I can't even keep track of it.
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  But Alex Jones is run by Russian bots.
[25:11.000 --> 25:17.000]  And the Russian bots said that the military was going to invade Texas in 2015 called Jade Helm.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  I never said any of that.
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  I'm going to cover some of that later.
[25:21.000 --> 25:24.000]  I said, look, it says Texas is hostile.
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.000]  This is part of conditioning the military for martial law if Obama ever wants it.
[25:29.000 --> 25:38.000]  And then we got the document last year where Soros' son was funding trying to create martial law all over the country with anti-police riots
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000]  to trigger civil unrest so Obama could have martial law.
[25:43.000 --> 25:49.000]  So there I was saying Obama is funding the Justice Department to try to trigger race war.
[25:49.000 --> 26:00.000]  Now we have the documents proving it. And Obama had the military out running around doing this training for overseas and domestically to condition the public.
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.000]  And why do you think I knew that back at the time?
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  It wasn't Russian bots.
[26:07.000 --> 26:15.000]  I was told that by the Army officers that were involved, that they supported what we were doing.
[26:15.000 --> 26:22.000]  They understood the media was putting out this info, that it was lies that they were coming to bring in martial law.
[26:22.000 --> 26:23.000]  We never said that.
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  We said, look, it has Texas listed as hostile.
[26:25.000 --> 26:39.000]  If you read the internal documents that were later released, it said to master the human domain and track everyone in live time using their cell phones, their social security numbers, their Facebook, their Twitter.
[26:39.000 --> 26:48.000]  And it was a practiced invasion of U.S. cities under Obama.
[26:48.000 --> 26:53.000]  But they used the sigh up front when I said, oh, look, this is training to take over America.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  Our own military was telling me this.
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  They spun it and said, Jones says this summer they're invading and they'll take your guns.
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.000]  There's no video. There's no text. There's no article.
[27:02.000 --> 27:07.000]  It is a misrepresentation.
[27:07.000 --> 27:10.000]  To again, try to turn the military against the broadcast.
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  But the military is actually listening.
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.000]  They know what I said versus how that was spun, but they keep retreading it.
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  Let me stop there.
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.000]  On the Israel situation, the globalist or ally with Islam, they're trying to bring down the West.
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  They're opening up our borders.
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.000]  They're using the Islamic threat to take our rights and it's wrong.
[27:29.000 --> 27:37.000]  That does not mean that the Israel lobby doesn't get out of hand and I have a problem with it.
[27:37.000 --> 27:41.000]  But I'm not an enemy of Israel and Trump understands that a choice has to be made
[27:41.000 --> 27:46.000]  and he's got to move the embassy and not be a coward to Jerusalem like you do in any other country.
[27:46.000 --> 27:53.000]  And then he's got to stand up and be firm with the baby Palestinians who are suicide bombing their kids today all over the world.
[27:53.000 --> 27:57.000]  So a whole bunch of suicide bombings all over the world, people blowing their little kids up.
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.000]  That's sick. That's satanic. That's child sacrifice.
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  It's disgusting.
[28:02.000 --> 28:12.000]  But Trump understands that now he can come out with a really good peace deal that actually has concessions by the Israelis they've never done.
[28:12.000 --> 28:20.000]  With this olive branch to Israel, now he can come back to the Palestinians and that's being announced.
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.000]  Just like North Korea, Trump really wants to try to fix these problems.
[28:24.000 --> 28:32.000]  But I don't think the Palestinians ever want to fix it because their whole identity is their women wearing hoods over their heads
[28:32.000 --> 28:39.000]  and cutting their little girls' genitals off and screaming on a hot bar and putting plastic explosives around their children
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  and having six kids and teaching, go north, go to Europe, conquer them. They are weak.
[28:43.000 --> 28:48.000]  I've got the Imam of Jerusalem, the head guy saying, we will take over Europe, their women, their eyes.
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  They are weak, pig people.
[28:51.000 --> 28:58.000]  You know what? When somebody says they're coming to conquer me, I hear them, I believe them, and I'm raising the alarm.
[29:21.000 --> 29:31.000]  You have been lied to.
[29:31.000 --> 29:36.000]  My name is Kevin Ship. I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[29:36.000 --> 29:41.000]  Finally, someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever.
[29:41.000 --> 29:47.000]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[29:47.000 --> 29:51.000]  I'm going to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people are.
[29:51.000 --> 29:54.000]  This is critical to get, to read, to give them a library, to give them a church.

[30:06.000 --> 30:11.000]  It'd take hours. Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price. It's stronger.
[30:11.000 --> 30:16.000]  It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.

[33:26.000 --> 33:43.000]  So, Trump wants to break the stalemates with China, with North Korea, with the EU, with Israel and the Palestinians.
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.000]  Trump wants to negotiate better deals.
[33:46.000 --> 33:50.000]  There's an article up on dredgerport.com that we'll be covering in the next segment,
[33:50.000 --> 33:57.000]  saying, big pivot by the president, Trump vows to protect jobs in China.
[33:57.000 --> 34:08.000]  Well, he comes in with these big tough announcements and hundreds of billions in all these different fines that we know China has been breaking agreements on.
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.000]  And then he comes back and says, but if you negotiate with us, we won't make it as harsh.
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  That's not flip-flopping. That's negotiating.
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.000]  And that's beginning to move the country in the right direction.
[34:20.000 --> 34:27.000]  But things have been so lopsided with China that Trump needs to push this really, really, really, really far.
[34:27.000 --> 34:38.000]  And to have the mainstream media up there complaining about $50 billion tariff on them when the trade deficit is $500 billion,
[34:38.000 --> 34:44.000]  not counting $300 billion in intellectual property stolen each year.
[34:44.000 --> 34:52.000]  And then now Trump slapped another $50 billion on them. That's $100 billion.
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  China has had it artificially set up on record.
[34:56.000 --> 35:03.000]  That's what globalism is to deindustrialize this country.
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.000]  They're the anti-American team.
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.000]  They're bringing us to our knees through economics. We're going to get to that in a moment.
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  I want to play some of these historic clips, though.
[35:11.000 --> 35:20.000]  Jared Kushner, he speaks. He actually spoke from there at the dedication of the embassy that opens today.
[35:20.000 --> 35:26.000]  I'll show you some of those photos. Put them up on screen. They're on infowars.com, newswars.com.
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.000]  There's a good one there with Ivanka Trump.
[35:29.000 --> 35:36.000]  Embassy United States of America, Jerusalem, Israel, Donald J. Trump president, Michael J. Pence, vice president.
[35:36.000 --> 35:41.000]  And it's so shocking that we would have an embassy in Jerusalem.
[35:41.000 --> 35:45.000]  That's how beat over the head we've been by the left.
[35:45.000 --> 35:50.000]  That's how manipulated we've been, that that is a big deal.
[35:50.000 --> 35:56.000]  When I've got a stack of articles where they will not prosecute people in Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, Finland,
[35:56.000 --> 36:04.000]  for raping little girls, 25, 30-year-old men, brutally gang rape little children,
[36:04.000 --> 36:09.000]  and the leftist virtue signaling media and judges say it's okay.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  And they're allied with Islam.
[36:12.000 --> 36:23.000]  Again, one of my only blind spots was 15, 20 years ago. People thought I was pro-radical Islam because I was against all these wars.
[36:23.000 --> 36:32.000]  I was against going into Iraq, and I still am, because we were destabilizing the more moderate countries
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  that were standing up to radical Islam.
[36:35.000 --> 36:41.000]  And now we know the plan. It's declassified to totally break the borders of Russia,
[36:41.000 --> 36:50.000]  Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, Western Europe, and flood the giant demographic numbers in and create an untenable crisis,
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.000]  out of which comes a total social estate allied with the Muslims.
[36:55.000 --> 37:01.000]  I know I keep harping on this, but that's the global takeover plan.
[37:01.000 --> 37:06.000]  The demographic globalist World War IV, they call the Cold War World War III,
[37:06.000 --> 37:19.000]  but this whole technotronic, technocracy takeover allied with Islam, savage, evil, corrupt, stone age, is here.
[37:19.000 --> 37:24.000]  And so that's what this is all about with Israel.
[37:24.000 --> 37:27.000]  I don't think Israel, just like the U.S., and just like France,
[37:27.000 --> 37:34.000]  didn't play in a double game working with the Muslims and working to flood Europe and this whole exploitative plan.
[37:34.000 --> 37:42.000]  But with Trump and other patriots and nationalists, we're trying to change this and have a real policy of prosperity
[37:42.000 --> 37:48.000]  and a good future and put pressure on radical Islam to reform itself and to stop.
[37:48.000 --> 37:54.000]  And as soon as the West told Saudi Arabia, you pull up, we're not going to back your Wahhabist ways,
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.000]  we're going to begin immediate seismic real reforms.
[37:58.000 --> 38:03.000]  Because it's been the dog wagging the tail, folks. Saudi Arabia is the tail.
[38:03.000 --> 38:12.000]  The globalists have been using it. We could snap our fingers and overthrow Saudi Arabia in five minutes.
[38:12.000 --> 38:19.000]  And the whole global order to cut the last and to militarize Islam and to flood everything
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  and make a deal with the socialists in the future, that deal is horrible.
[38:23.000 --> 38:29.000]  That deal is crazy and abusive and psychotic. That's what the left does.
[38:29.000 --> 38:35.000]  Hitler tried to sign on with Islam to flood Europe, the same crap and the Kalergi plan and all of it.
[38:35.000 --> 38:42.000]  We're not going along with it. And here's the deal, unelected globalism.
[38:42.000 --> 38:52.000]  It's owned and run by the big tech giants and big banks that each big bank, each big tech giant is bigger than most major countries GDP.
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.000]  Last time I checked Walmart had the 12th largest GDP in the world.
[38:57.000 --> 39:07.000]  Apple, last time I was looking at it, has more revenue than from the poorest 100 countries up.
[39:07.000 --> 39:14.000]  More than 100 countries put together doesn't have the GDP of Apple.
[39:14.000 --> 39:21.000]  I haven't looked at it in about a year. Let's look up companies that have GDPs bigger than major countries.
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.000]  It's stunning. Stunning.
[39:25.000 --> 39:42.000]  And these guys were setting up a world government where their tax exempt, where they have diplomatic immunity, where they don't pay taxes.
[39:42.000 --> 39:51.000]  It's incredible. And they are on power trips and they've launched a breakaway civilization with life extension and everything else.
[39:51.000 --> 39:59.000]  And they've made the decision.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  They've made the decision that the future doesn't need us.
[40:02.000 --> 40:10.000]  And just like everything else I told you 20 years ago is now admitted, folks better pay attention to this broadcast.
[40:10.000 --> 40:16.000]  Because all the known research thinking people know what I'm saying is true.
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.000]  They just don't believe in you and think you're going to do anything about it.
[40:19.000 --> 40:25.000]  So they're just keeping their mouth shut.
[40:25.000 --> 40:28.000]  So we're going to come back and play these historic clips.
[40:28.000 --> 40:31.000]  Trump pre-recorded message for Israel Embassy opening in Jerusalem.
[40:31.000 --> 40:34.000]  Netanyahu speaks before US Jerusalem Assembly.
[40:34.000 --> 40:39.000]  Kushner speaks on strength of American-Israel relations.
[40:39.000 --> 40:44.000]  Now, the fact that I don't want to blow Israel off the map and let George Soros, the Islamists, have it.
[40:44.000 --> 40:50.000]  Does it mean I support everything Israel does or some of the globalist, you know, Israel first groups?
[40:50.000 --> 40:56.000]  And the ADL, that's a pro-radical Islamic anti-American organization.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  But there's nothing now compared to Southern Barber Law Center.
[40:58.000 --> 41:05.000]  Goodness gracious. Southern Barber Law Center is just an anti-American, anti-free speech disaster.
[41:05.000 --> 41:13.000]  But what I like seeing is American Jews really get on board with Trump and info wars.
[41:13.000 --> 41:18.000]  That's a good thing. People always accuse me of some weird mentally ill Jewish conspiracy.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  I'm involved in when there's zero.
[41:20.000 --> 41:27.000]  To the contrary, Hollywood leftist Jews and Soros, Nazi collaborators like him and others have attacked me.
[41:27.000 --> 41:32.000]  Nonsensically, continually. Because they're all part of the globalist program.
[41:32.000 --> 41:37.000]  But real Jewish Americans are hardworking patriots. They're just like everybody else. They love info wars.
[41:37.000 --> 41:40.000]  They actually listen and they know what's going on.
[41:40.000 --> 41:45.000]  And so I saw photos and articles of people out there supporting Trump with info wars shirts on all the rest of it.
[41:45.000 --> 41:49.000]  I like that. I'm not ashamed of supporting good people in Israel.
[41:49.000 --> 41:57.000]  I'm not ashamed of supporting good Muslims who don't want to be part of this larger caliphate.
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.000]  So again, it just comes down to that. I'm not with Soros. I'm not with radical Islam.
[42:02.000 --> 42:10.000]  And you bet, I support Israel. But by being a supporter of Israel, then I can have more influence on things I don't like Israel's doing.
[42:10.000 --> 42:18.000]  See how that works? It's being realistic and not just on one side vitriolically or the other.
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.000]  Alright, briefly. So I haven't even plugged it today.
[42:21.000 --> 42:26.000]  We've got a bunch of amazing products. Whatever the best supplement is, we go out, get it, make it even stronger.
[42:26.000 --> 42:34.000]  Whatever's got the best results, best reviews, strongest stuff out there for energy, stamina, inflammation, your bodies, 50% off.

[43:03.000 --> 43:10.000]  In a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[43:10.000 --> 43:16.000]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[43:16.000 --> 43:19.000]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[43:19.000 --> 43:25.000]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw of medical doctors prescribing to their patients.
[43:25.000 --> 43:31.000]  But it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  And I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers.
[43:35.000 --> 43:40.000]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[43:40.000 --> 43:46.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones
[43:46.000 --> 43:49.000]  that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.000]  It is amazing.
[43:52.000 --> 44:17.000]  Red pill now available at M4WarsLive.com and your purchase of the operation.
[44:22.000 --> 44:28.000]  The portable new purifying formula is dentists recommended for daily use whenever you feel like you need to stay clean.

[44:36.000 --> 44:43.000]  With powerful yet simple ingredients, Immune Gargle features Silver Soul Nano Silver for a powerful cleansing alternative.

[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  The super blue is awesome.
[45:32.000 --> 45:35.000]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the infowarslife products.
[45:35.000 --> 45:36.000]  They are quality.
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  I can't wait to get some more.
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[45:41.000 --> 45:42.000]  Absolutely.
[45:42.000 --> 45:50.000]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on.
[45:50.000 --> 45:55.000]  And if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[45:55.000 --> 46:07.000]  Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[46:07.000 --> 46:15.000]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.000]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[46:19.000 --> 46:23.000]  CNN and many others are calling for infowars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[46:23.000 --> 46:30.000]  Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship, brainwash young people against infowars.
[46:30.000 --> 46:35.000]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.000]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[46:39.000 --> 46:46.000]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com, forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you.
[46:46.000 --> 46:54.000]  And so the censors can bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue as a society.
[46:54.000 --> 47:23.000]  That is critical to this fight. We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[47:23.000 --> 47:27.000]  It was a beautiful day.
[47:27.000 --> 47:35.000]  Israeli snipers kill scores of Palestinians and wound 2,400 as 35,000 protesters rally against the US Embassy opening in Jerusalem,
[47:35.000 --> 47:40.000]  overseen by Trump's Middle East envoy Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka.
[47:40.000 --> 47:47.000]  And you know I'm glad the Daily Mail is covering that and I'm glad that we're covering it and I'm glad that Drudge Report has it.
[47:47.000 --> 47:58.000]  We're covering it just because I support Israel doesn't mean I support the image of drones firing tear gas at demonstrators or snipers shooting people.
[47:58.000 --> 48:06.000]  But you see the media hardly covers it with the hourly suicide bombings or people getting stabbed to death or run over by trucks.
[48:06.000 --> 48:11.000]  They won't even ever say it's Islamic.
[48:11.000 --> 48:19.000]  So see it just should say snipers kill scores of people and wound 2,400.
[48:19.000 --> 48:26.000]  Because if it was Islamists doing it they would not say Muslims or Islamists.
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.000]  They would just say snipers kill.
[48:30.000 --> 48:38.000]  And if the police reported that it was Islamists doing it they'd get fired.
[48:38.000 --> 48:45.000]  Oh and what are the folks doing? They're trying to knock down the fences and climb over for an intifada.
[48:45.000 --> 48:52.000]  And you've got your nice mix of suicide bombings going on. So it's tribal warfare.
[48:52.000 --> 48:57.000]  You know what happens if the Palestinians try to go over the fence into Egypt? They get shot.
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  You know what happens if they try to go over the fence into Jordan? They get shot.
[49:00.000 --> 49:06.000]  You know what happens if they try to go over the fence into Saudi Arabia? They get shot.
[49:06.000 --> 49:11.000]  But see you never see that on the news. It's just a little footnote, the foreign news.
[49:11.000 --> 49:20.000]  You only hear about it if Israel is shooting or tear gassing people.
[49:20.000 --> 49:25.000]  And again I don't like any of it. But I'm also not mentally ill.
[49:25.000 --> 49:33.000]  And I know that the media always covers what Israel does under a big magnifying glass.
[49:33.000 --> 49:38.000]  And then when there'll probably be 20 or 30 bombings in Nigeria this week by Muslims,
[49:38.000 --> 49:42.000]  all one-sided killing Christians, nothing in our news.
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  There'll be bombings all over the Middle East, all over Central Asia, shootings, killings,
[49:46.000 --> 49:51.000]  little girls having their throats slit, lined up and shot, gays being thrown off buildings,
[49:51.000 --> 49:59.000]  priests being murdered and not one word out of that demon pope who says open the borders of Europe.
[49:59.000 --> 50:04.000]  There's almost no coverage of little girls getting raped.
[50:04.000 --> 50:09.000]  If jihadists in Germany see you walking with your dog they'll physically attack you screaming
[50:09.000 --> 50:14.000]  unclean, unclean. That's constantly in the back of the newspaper.
[50:14.000 --> 50:24.000]  See what I'm getting at now? How my brain works? How my brain works.
[50:24.000 --> 50:30.000]  Is that I warn you about drones being prepared a decade ago for tear gassing and crowds with a company
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.000]  that got a Homeland Security contract and the media comes out and says,
[50:33.000 --> 50:37.000]  Jones made it up because they didn't want to have a debate about it.
[50:37.000 --> 50:42.000]  And now it's happening in Israel.
[50:42.000 --> 50:48.000]  But the reason I support Trump and the reason I'm supporting Israel is Trump has a plan to try to end this crud.
[50:48.000 --> 50:54.000]  And if the Palestinians, it's going to get announced the next few months, we know how Trump operates.
[50:54.000 --> 51:00.000]  It's already been announced, it'll be announced soon, a real deal for massive economic development
[51:00.000 --> 51:08.000]  in the West Bank, in the Gaza Strip, in all those areas, concessions on land, you name it.
[51:08.000 --> 51:11.000]  But Trump's got to butter Israel up first.
[51:11.000 --> 51:14.000]  So I want to see peace there.
[51:14.000 --> 51:21.000]  I know there's a lot of bad conditions for the Palestinians, but I equally blame the Arabs just as much.
[51:21.000 --> 51:25.000]  And I'm sick of them getting a pass. I'm done.
[51:25.000 --> 51:30.000]  I will not sit here and be a hypocrite. I will point out hypocrisy when I see it.
[51:30.000 --> 51:36.000]  I'm going to play some of these clips in a moment, but first, we tweeted this last week and I meant to cover it.
[51:36.000 --> 51:39.000]  And I saw it in my stack, so I'm going to cover it again right now.
[51:39.000 --> 51:44.000]  I just retweeted this at Real Alex Jones about 10 minutes ago. Ask Paul to retweet it.
[51:44.000 --> 51:48.000]  I really want to have this go viral because this illustrates everything.
[51:48.000 --> 51:53.000]  We haven't predicted last year when we saw this that this was going to end up happening.
[51:53.000 --> 52:03.000]  We tweeted Los Angeles Times, October 6, 2017,
[52:03.000 --> 52:14.000]  knowingly exposing others to HIV will no longer be a felony in California. It'll be a Class C misdemeanor or a ticket, $100 ticket.
[52:14.000 --> 52:17.000]  That means hepatitis, you name it. Just go ahead and kill somebody.
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  You can even give blood and a lot of that gets through.
[52:19.000 --> 52:22.000]  Then kill a bunch of hemophiliacs or somebody has a car wreck,
[52:22.000 --> 52:26.000]  uses a blood transfusion, you die a horrible HIV death. Isn't that sweet?
[52:26.000 --> 52:29.000]  Because we don't want a stigma.
[52:29.000 --> 52:36.000]  All the virtue signaling and I predicted that we would see STDs go up and they would spin it and say it was racism or something.
[52:36.000 --> 52:42.000]  And sure enough, last week, look at this headline, STDs in LA County are skyrocketing.
[52:42.000 --> 52:48.000]  Officials think racism and stigma may be to blame. Wow.
[52:48.000 --> 52:56.000]  People shooting up, having sex on the streets. Southern California in the LA area is like a dystopic nightmare.
[52:56.000 --> 52:59.000]  The smog, the homeless people, the needles.
[52:59.000 --> 53:04.000]  And if you're a radio listener, this isn't as powerful. It's the same LA Times format.
[53:04.000 --> 53:14.000]  It's their same tweets, side by side. This is not even edited. This is their tweets.
[53:14.000 --> 53:21.000]  They're headlines, knowingly exposing others to HIV will no longer be a felony in California to get rid of the stigma
[53:21.000 --> 53:24.000]  and fight sexism and racism, the article went on to say.
[53:24.000 --> 53:29.000]  Then, less than a year later, STDs in LA County are skyrocketing.
[53:29.000 --> 53:35.000]  Officials think racism and stigma may be to blame. No, you're to blame for this atmosphere.
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.000]  You crazy people. And here are the actual articles.
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  Knowingly exposing others HIV will no longer be a felony.
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  And the governor has said how great it was.
[53:43.000 --> 53:51.000]  And they actually had the advocate websites and all those go, look, Jones is being homophobic.
[53:51.000 --> 53:56.000]  You're the one being homophobic. What are you doing? Attaching HIV to gay people only?
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  What about intervening as drug users? What about heterosexuals? What about all this stuff?
[54:00.000 --> 54:08.000]  But again, this is crazy. And then the STD levels go up. STDs in LA County are skyrocketing.
[54:08.000 --> 54:11.000]  There's the actual LA Times articles.
[54:11.000 --> 54:17.000]  All right, getting back to the news in Israel, let's go ahead and go to this Jared Kushner.
[54:17.000 --> 54:21.000]  He speaks on the strength of American-Israel relations.
[54:21.000 --> 54:26.000]  A very rare moment when Jared Kushner opens his mouth. Here it is.
[54:26.000 --> 54:34.000]  In December of last year, President Trump announced to the world that the United States would finally recognize the truth.
[54:34.000 --> 54:38.000]  That Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.
[54:38.000 --> 54:47.000]  He also declared that we would soon move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
[54:47.000 --> 54:55.000]  And just five months later, we are standing on these grounds.
[54:55.000 --> 55:02.000]  While presidents before him have backed down from their pledge to move the American embassy once in office,
[55:02.000 --> 55:13.000]  this president delivered. Because when President Trump makes a promise, he keeps it.
[55:13.000 --> 55:18.000]  But today also demonstrates American leadership. By moving our embassy to Jerusalem,
[55:18.000 --> 55:23.000]  we have shown the world once again that the United States can be trusted.
[55:23.000 --> 55:30.000]  We stand with our friends and our allies. And above all else, we've shown that the United States of America
[55:30.000 --> 55:40.000]  will do what's right, and so we have.
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.000]  Israel is a sovereign nation with the right to determine its own capital,
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.000]  the same right that is enjoyed by every other country in the world.
[55:47.000 --> 55:54.000]  In taking this action, the United States has also chosen to strengthen the bond between our two countries.
[55:54.000 --> 55:57.000]  Our special bond is the envy of nations throughout the world.
[55:57.000 --> 56:02.000]  This bond is forged through shared history, sustained through shared interests,
[56:02.000 --> 56:05.000]  and immortalized through shared principles.
[56:05.000 --> 56:10.000]  The United States stands with Israel because we both believe in freedom.
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  We stand together because we both believe in human rights.
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.000]  We stand together because we believe democracy is worth defending.
[56:19.000 --> 56:29.000]  And the United States stands with Israel because we believe we know that it is the right thing to do.
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.000]  That's good. Let's break this down. And of course, Kushner just said it right there.
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  It's straight up, straight shooting. It's a text and I like that.
[56:36.000 --> 56:41.000]  And with Trump, what he says is what you get.
[56:41.000 --> 56:45.000]  Like he came on the show and said, I will not let you down.
[56:45.000 --> 56:49.000]  Give me a year. We'll start turning the country around.
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  I mean, it's just dead on.
[56:51.000 --> 56:57.000]  It's with Trump, you actually, he straight shoots you. It makes me stutter.
[56:57.000 --> 57:02.000]  It's so unbelievable. And even if you don't agree with some of his policies,
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  maybe you don't agree with this Israel thing.
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.000]  Moving the embassy there from Tel Aviv.
[57:08.000 --> 57:13.000]  Really? That's that big a deal? Riot and go crazy?
[57:13.000 --> 57:16.000]  And now Trump is prepping the Israeli Palestinian peace plan.
[57:16.000 --> 57:22.000]  But I don't think the Palestinians are going to want to take the money and the power plants and the swimming pools and the factories.
[57:22.000 --> 57:28.000]  North Korea, though, once Pompeo says post nuclear Korean economy will rival South Korea.
[57:28.000 --> 57:33.000]  That's the real economic deal. And the U.S. is cutting North Korea out from China.
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.000]  The Chinese and the Koreans have always hated each other, by the way.
[57:36.000 --> 57:39.000]  China's been invading it scores of times last thousand years.
[57:39.000 --> 57:43.000]  And so they're being offered the full Marshall plan, baby.
[57:43.000 --> 57:46.000]  People say, well, they're a dictator. That'll phase all that out.
[57:46.000 --> 58:11.000]  It'll make their lives a lot better. I'm all for it.
[58:11.000 --> 58:22.000]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[58:22.000 --> 58:27.000]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains one to five percent of active ingredients.
[58:27.000 --> 58:32.000]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95 percent of the active ingredients.
[58:32.000 --> 58:41.000]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[59:26.000 --> 59:33.000]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products, and this part is most important.
[59:33.000 --> 59:45.000]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard. That means it's clean, that means it's pure, and rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the info war.

[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  Omar Navarro is running against the anti-American frothing gangster kingpin Kujo, also known as the globalist motormouth Maxine Waters.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  He's going to be popping in bottom of the next hour to talk about all her antics, and we've got Milo here in studio working on a bunch of stuff. We're thinking about going out and working on a special report today after the broadcast as well, so stay tuned for that.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  Not going to announce what it is yet, obviously, but we're going to be busy little beavers.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  So Miloianopoulos is going to be in studio with us coming up in about 30 minutes.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  I told myself I'm going to be calm, at least for this foreseeable future, because I let myself look at all this news and get wound up, but I thought, why not just have some of the nice calm, Alex?
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  And you know, in the last hour, I think on a scale of one to ten, my most obnoxious, I was about a three.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  So we're going to see if I can be a good boy today, because there is no producer in charge of me, maybe there should be.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  But I just, these subjects are so heady, so powerful, so big, so serious that the times are so important that I've raised the alarm with the hysterics.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  And we should be hysterical about a lot of things happening to get people out of their trance, but there's also a time, I think, to be smooth, and I think I'm going to try to be a little smoother, at least here and there.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  But we'll see. The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  But here's Netanyahu on the historic opening of the U.S. Embassy, and Trump's announcement that he wants a big peace deal and economic development for the Palestinians.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  But of course, there's nothing like being victims and drama queenings, so I don't expect they're going to accept the deal, but don't say Trump isn't going to try to give them their fattest deal ever.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  That, of course, will be summarily torn up and urinated all over. But hey, that's what it is.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  I'm just not into the whole cause celeb thing for Palestine. I've been bullied and brainwashed my whole life about it, and I reject it.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  But I'm also not a cult follower of Israel, either. I just don't want to blow them off the map like George Soros does.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  There's a lot of good people over there, and they've got hundreds of nuclear weapons, so they're not going anywhere.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  Know about the Samson option? Bring the whole house down? Yeah.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  Keep dreaming Soros. Keep dreaming devil pope. You're not bringing Israel down, scum. See, that'll make you really a line.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  Because the very same dirtbags are trying to destroy me. They're trying to destroy Israel, and that really makes you pull back.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  You know, I have the exact same enemies. Why have I been bullied into not being more pro-Israel?
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  Because my enemies know I'm not anti-Israel. They know I support Israel. I don't worship it like a Christian Zionist.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  I've got a lot of family and people that are big, big, big, I guess you'd call it Baptist or almost evangelical.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  I went to both Baptist and even physical churches growing up as a kid.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  But yeah, they're more pro-Israel people that live in Israel, some of those folks, and it gets a little crazy.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  The world's ending every year, and oh my God, it's the end of the world. They got to run to Israel to pray. Everything's going to get blown up.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  You know, there's that extreme over there, not really close family or anything, but not my mom or dad.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  I guess a lot of close family, you could call them Christian Zionists.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  So I grew up with that giving me a headache.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  And then all the leftist Jews running around calling everybody anti-Semite of their pro-America, that gets really old.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  And you've got all the Muslim groups trying to bully you into being anti-Israel, and that gets old.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  And George Soros trying to bully you into it, and I'm just sick of it.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  If I keep saying I work for Israel, I'm going to do a trip.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  In the next year, I'm going to Israel and I'm going to Russia because I'm not against either one of them and I also don't work for them.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  I'm an American. My family helped found this thing. That's who I serve.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  I want to plow into all of this, that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts,
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer. And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  And you cannot beat that for children and adults. We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  That's my dad, the colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  You know, I don't normally get into the Stormy Daniels thing, because she never alleged abuse.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  And you can tell that Melania is a pretty wild number herself. If she was a car, she'd have like 5,000 horsepower.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  If anything, the Stormy Daniels was a 10 steps down. I mean, my God, what a woman Melania. Have a woman like that, that's all you need right there, right?
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  But whatever, we didn't elect Trump to be a choir boy. We elect him to get stuff done. He's not a hypocrite.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  If he got up there and talked about family values all day long and swore he'd never cheated on his wife or never had a girlfriend, I'd be really angry.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  But guess what? He did never do that.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  Just like he keeps fulfilling his promises, just like he keeps delivering on what he says he'll do, doesn't mean I agree with all of it.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  I disagree with about 10%, but I really agree with, you know, what you told me you're going to do or really try.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  Man, that's so valuable. I grew up in Texas when Texas was still Texas.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  And we're men, we're men and women, we're women. And if you ever lied to somebody after you were a teenager, because teenagers are all kind of fib and stuff,
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  just know on whatever, even be around you. I mean, the value is in people knowing that guy's a rock.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  I want to be known as a rock.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:02.000]  I want people to know, hey, Jones says something he's going to really do it. That's my currency.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  Like Tony Montana says, there's only two things you got in this world and I won't break them for anybody, my word or my way of host.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  And that's the truth. And that is really all you got at the end of the day.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  And that's why Trump is so refreshing. In fact, I hardly ever do this. I'm going to play Kushner twice.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  Wow. Why is it Kushner? But speaking, he looks pretty authoritative, looks strong. Got a nice gleam in the eye.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  Sounds nervous, but hey, man, get over it, bro. You come off strong.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  And again, take Israel out of the equation here.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  Trump said he'd do this. He did it. That's why North Korea knows you give up your nicks.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  We're going to put in power stations all over your country and the South's ready to totally develop you.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  Within 15 years after the Korean War, it was already one of the richest countries in the world, the entire South was basically leveled.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  Millions dead. It's the most productive country in the world. The North is the most unproductive.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  That's communism versus capitalism, again, screaming out at everybody.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  I saw some idiot article saying, Alex Jones says, Iceland doesn't exist.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  And I read it and it's like, Jones claims there's no successful socialist or communist countries, but Iceland's successful.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  Actually, contrary, the only socialist countries that are successful are northern European, homogenous, ice age populations, which are very high rates of OCD, very high rates of...
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  The trains are all on time. Everybody is extremely neurotic, genetically, because if you went outside five minutes too long in the genetic background of those people, you were dead.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  They're always finding people buried in the ice up there in their little furs and the little group of fish they had on their side or whatever, flash frozen.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  Back from the ice age, just 10,000 years ago, covered a nice year round, sometimes the year, two hours of sunlight, you can only go out during that.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  Yes, yes, northern Europeans, yes, Viking populations were known for being ravenous and murderous and all this other stuff.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  That's really just one small avenue of the background of it. They actually opened up what's Russia today with their flat boats.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  They've dug them up in China, northern China. They've dug up hundreds of Vikings, their whole settlements, you name it, trading.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  It was an ancient trading empire, but they actually were very communal.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  You can be communal in small groups of a few hundred people, and you can have little towns and little villages in Iceland with 400,000 people.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  No one ever said you can't have communes on a farm. You don't have them, though, with big cities and, you know, 100 million people.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  That creates hell on earth and the ultimate class system, but I'm already digressing. I don't even get off onto that.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  The point is, oh, I was talking about North Korea. Trump is making a deal with North Korea. He's about to make a deal with the Palestinians if they'll take it.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  Pompeo says nuclear North Korea economy, the post-nuclear economy, will rival the South.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  And he said, you're going to have electricity and you're going to have jobs and you're going to be able to go on vacations and you're going to be able to eat meat.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  And I saw some trendy publication go, oh, as if eating meat is the symbol of success.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  It sure as hell is in North Korea where most people have never had any meat.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  That's the ultra-rich. That's Korea speak right there.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  We're about to turn your lights on, baby. We're about to bring you into the 21st century. You're smart. You're hardworking.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  You're about to get emancipated from communism and the UN 60-something years ago that made the decision to let the communist Chinese run the north
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  because the CIA had just put Mao Zedong into power three years before treasonously.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  And all that new world order is getting overturned. All those stinking plans to keep huge groups of people in hell is being reversed.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  Trump is trying to reverse it. He said, I want victory for the planet.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  You know how much that upsets the globalists that have set this whole thing up? It makes them pull their hair out.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  So here is Kushner. Then I'll play BB and then I'll play Trump.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  But the Kushner statement is powerful. This is the whole gist of everything Trump's doing.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  If he doesn't deliver on what he says he does, other people won't listen like Gaddafi.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  Obama said, give us all your money, invest with us, open it up to the West.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  Let your country be taken over by the West for industrialization and we won't kill you.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  And he went to Europe and met their bodies like, great, I want to be your friend. They set him up and killed him.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  You don't think the world didn't watch that treachery so they could bring in a bunch of radical jihadis and murder tens of thousands of innocent people
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  and kill every black they see on site because the Arabs are so racist?
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  Here's Kushner. In December of last year, President Trump announced to the world
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  that the United States would finally recognize the truth that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  He also declared that we would soon move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  and just five months later we are standing on these grounds.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  While presidents before him have backed down from their pledge to move the American embassy once in office,
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  this president delivered because when President Trump makes a promise, he keeps it.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  But today also demonstrates American leadership.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  By moving our embassy to Jerusalem, we have shown the world once again that the United States can be trusted.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  We stand with our friends and our allies and above all else we've shown that the United States of America will do what's right and so we have.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  That's right. I mean, big deal, move an embassy.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  Israel is a sovereign nation with the right to determine its own capital, the same right that is enjoyed by every other country in the world.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  In taking this action, the United States has also chosen to strengthen the bond between our two countries.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  Now understand, every time I try to give the Palestinians stuff, they blow up even more.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  They don't want to have a deal. They want Israel gone.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  So we're like, hey, you want Israel gone? That's not happening. Game over.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  You want to have a real discussion and act like adults? Let's do it.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  We don't want that because everywhere in the Middle East is a squalid hellhole of people crapping on the side of the road and wiping their rear ends with their hands and just absolutely living in hell.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  And Islam has had golden period. It's not always been like this.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  But since the Wahhabists and the Bedouins of Saudi Arabia with all that oil money got control of Islam in the last 50 years, we got a problem, Jack.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  We got a big problem. And you notice Trump went to Saudi Arabia first and said, knock it off.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  And believe me, when he was over there, they had, and I'm not even saying this is a good thing, but they had thousands of people hanging up by their ankles.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  The Al Qaeda people got killed. All the princes that weren't in line, they got waterboarded and hung up by their ankles.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs. So you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey purified water.

[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  Infowars to be shut down, taken off the web. Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship, brainwash young people against Infowars.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say. We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.

[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  From the front lines of the Information War it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  Okay, well we're all focused on the Israel situation. There's so much other news.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  I'm going to cover this a little bit later when Milo Annopoulos is in studio with us here. BuzzFeed has an article out talking about there's a new feature with Facebook letting you know when there's Russian bots involved.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  Well, I mean a Russian website or a Russian web crawler or a Russian sock puppet, every country, every company has these that's involved in this can go out and post things.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  Just as somebody posts something, see how an article you have with a thousand comments doesn't mean you're a Russian agent.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  They have us in there because Dan Lyman is setting up a European bureau and he lives in Switzerland with his wife. He's an American.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  That's coming up. I mean, ladies and gentlemen, so now there's this idea that if you are independent media and you have a foreign bureau
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  that you're run by.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  And it says that it has a manager in Switzerland. What does that even mean? You know why we have a European bureau? Because we're on planet Earth.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:19.000]  And it's great having somebody seven, eight hours ahead of us. And we got Paul Watson and his brother Steve Watson.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  But see, they didn't say, look, he's far and run. I hadn't even seen that one article you put up. Good Lord.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  Look, he's far and run now. They don't go, oh, look from England because England's too friendly to us. You know, we're celebrating the Queen and all this other weird anti-American stuff now.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  So that's not alien enough, but I tell you, if the war is managed from Switzerland, yeah. Well, I sure wish.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  You know, this morning, Dan Lyman, I wish he had told me what I should cover first. That's like Maxine Waters, Mad Maxine.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  We got to find that clip again where she says, Putin, he tells Trump what to do. The slogans, drain the swamp, lock her up.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  Putin told Trump that over the phone. You're like, you're a lunatic lady. Unbelievable. I can't even keep track of it anymore.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  Like I meant to cover the Jade Helm thing. That's it. All over the news everywhere.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  Saying that the Russians ran that and told me to say there was a military exercise called Jade Helm was going to take over Texas.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  I never said they were taking over Texas. It listed Texas as hostile and said it was a drill to practice martial law, which they later confirmed.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  But this is the level of disinfo. There are no Russian influences here, but Daria, who's been in the U.S. Army and her parents moved over here to get away from the Soviet Union.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  And I tell you, he's a great employee. We need to find some more Russians if they're all this good.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  But I mean, imagine in America, I got to sit here and say to the liberals who are always about open free society and all this stuff.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  Hey, I'm not a Russian and it's okay to have somebody with a Russian background work here, right?
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  Like it's okay, right? Because you're like worse than McCarthy could have ever imagined.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  McCarthy was going after real communists in our government and it turned out he was correct.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  Remember, he said it's weird, big foundations and the army are involved.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  I've now learned the highest levels propping up the Soviet Union. That's when the witch hunt was ended.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  When he was just setting up a police state, the globalists liked it.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  But as soon as he went, wait a minute, we're running it from here. It was like, oh no, it was like a record skipping or a car wrecking that noise when it slams on the brakes.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  No, no, no, McCarthy, you're too good a bloodhound. You actually found out the whole paradigm conspiracy.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  Just like they said, oh, we never wiretap the president elect or the president.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  Oh, there's no conspiracy of a bunch of Democrats to do that.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  And of course, they did do it illegally. They did lie to Congress and it's a conspiracy.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  Something yet to get to Netanyahu, but that was after doing the break. We have seen it on the coffee room and it's like, Netanyahu's got blood on his hands.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  Fifty-something dead. Yeah, rioting, people throwing rocks and, you know, suicide bombers and the rest of it.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  And then now it's all Netanyahu's fault. And again, I'm not even defending Netanyahu. There's stuff about him I don't like.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  But every time Israel does something, it's all over the news and we know about it and it's an outrage.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  Just like when there's a school shooting, we hear about it at Nazism, but the thousands of stabbing deaths or the thousands of baseball killings or the thousands of murders in Chicago every year
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  got 50-something kids killed in mass shootings every year on average. 50-something. That's a terrible number.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  But over 2,000 killed every year in Chicago for a decade running, 4,000-plus shot.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  You don't know their names. You don't take those victims and put them up and they're like, cause celebs, household names like David Hogg.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  Again, they ran ads in the mid-80s and the late 70s, early 70s, over and over again after Jaws came out.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  When new Jaws' would come out, they would see at seashore towns up to 50%. You can look this up.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  50% reductions in people coming to the beach.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  You've got on average 7 to 10 great white killings globally every year, most of them in Australia.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  But people all think that if you go swimming, Jaws is going to eat you.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  Got a better chance stepping on a dirty needle or glass or stepping on a stingray or something.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  But you don't have a big chance of a great white shark eating you.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  Maybe a couple hundred shark deaths total a year, but there's a perception that it is absolutely everywhere, just like Israel.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  Everything Israel does, we know all about, we hear all about constantly in the so-called pro-Israel media here in the US, but that's not what it is.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  They want the Vatican and the UN running Israel as part of this world government plan, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  We're going to go to the right. I got sidetracked, but this is incredible.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  This is amazing.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  Notice the new Facebook feature doesn't show you other Facebook things that are run from overseas, only pro-Trump.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  See, we're being singled out, and I can't believe they couldn't find a Russian bot or two.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  Russia is a big country. There's got to be somebody in Russia who won't name for worse.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  We've got a lot of fans over there. They call anybody a bot. They call me a bot.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  But think about that. They all they could find was Switzerland.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  Well, we're going to break cover all this with Milo on the other side.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  By the way, Stormy Daniels lawyer, like I said, I don't normally cover Stormy Daniels, but she's really getting in hot water now,
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  and her lawyer is lashing out and threatening to sue people if they talk about his past or anything.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  You're a public figure, bro.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  So that's all coming up, and so much more, infowars.com, newswars.com.

[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:33.000]  I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:43.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.

[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and infowarslife.com.
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  It's a real rhythm to marry stories like the Clinton body count story. That's according to website infowars.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  Mr. Ricketts confirmed there are at least some shooters to the fully automatic weapons.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  GF King was shot from the back and the front.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  It was almost as if it were planned in motion. It just panicked.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000]  It took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the phone.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work, operating in areas that we can't control.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  UFOs.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  Is this global governance at last? Is it one world with central bankers in charge?
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  Israel claims the attack was accidental, but some former U.S. naval officers say it was on purpose.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  Russian scum.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  Denied everything. He called it all fake news.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  This is the national evidence if they killed Trump or removed Trump.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  It will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  This is a fiend of high-level religion.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  We are at war with Russia.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and Whitby Bates?
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  The White House and the President are citing info wars.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  They could shut us down. You're next.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  And we have Milo Yiannopoulos, best-selling author, a firebrand, a patriot in the studio with us for the next hour.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  Then the man running against Mad Dog, Maxine Waters, is going to be joining us.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  Mr. Navarro is going to be joining us. That should be very, very...
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  Brave man.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  Very, very interesting. She's vicious.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  She's sort of got that thing, you know, like I always say about liberals who are really up against it.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  You know, like a dog that's just about to die, and they get sort of the most vicious and deranged just before they expire.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  Sort of being kicked to death, and it doesn't care anymore, and it'll lash out and bite.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  She's got that sort of look on her face.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  Well, listen, she starred in The Dark Crystal back in the early days.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  The Skexies.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  Yeah, I mean, she's been, you know, around a while.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  You know, she also played Darth Sidious in Episode 4 of Star Wars.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  It's funny because they keep having these errors in the credits where they credit somebody else for the role, and she must be very mad.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  Yeah, she's amazing.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  No, but getting serious here, you've got a lot on your plate. I got a lot of questions, things I want to talk to you about, about the war on free speech.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  You were kind of patient zero. They went after you first.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  Now they're doing it to everybody, but this latest thing is, right here, Facebook goes, oh look, we have a feature that shows which pro-Trump Facebook pages are run from overseas, Milo.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  And it goes, oh my God, someone's posting officially on Info Wars from Switzerland, showing we're far and run. So now it's not even Russian because they can't find anything Russian going on there.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  They're now claiming that Info Wars is Swiss.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  It's a Swiss conspiracy.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  All the best things in the world. Chocolate, peace, brotherly love and Info Wars. They're all from Switzerland.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  Well, we have a reporter who's married to European lady, but he's Dan Lyman, and he reports for us from Switzerland.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  Right.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  But now, I guess, you've like, gosh, if you're an international news organization that happens to have a bureau somewhere, what happens to the BBC's Moscow Bureau?
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  Are they suddenly going to be posting from Russia? What about CNN when they dispatch reporters to Damascus?
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  Well, that's what I'm getting at. These tricks they're playing to claim we're far and run are getting more ridiculous.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  This is about the most American company I've ever walked in, I gotta tell you.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  No, this is a perfect example of their selective application of rules. Rules that are deliberately kept vague, deliberately kept ill-defined.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  Twitter is, of course, the master at this. They have abuse and harassment and targeted, you know what, rules.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  Which, it's never really made clear, and they refuse to make it clear what they mean by any of that stuff, and they do that on purpose.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  They do it so that they can selectively apply those rules to damage their ideology.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  What did you make of the CEO? Because you said he's launching a jihad against conservatives, libertarians, free thinkers.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  You know what I'm saying about Jack Dorsey, as you know a month ago, and said, we're in a civil war and we're going to, quote, crush conservatives.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  Oh yeah, a medium post that said there can be no more reconciliation between Republicans and Democrats.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  There can be no more, you know, happy, all getting along, whatever.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  What needs to happen now in America is that the Republicans need to be effectively extinguished.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  They need to be eradicated from public life. And that's what the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, reposted on Twitter with his endorsement.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  He's like, yes, this is very thoughtful. You know, was one of his co-founders and Jack Dorsey retweeted it.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  We already know, of course, through the principles and practices and behavior of the company that he runs, what his beliefs are.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  But increasingly, they're not even trying to hide anymore. This is not a neutral public platform.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  This is not a platform that is welcoming of all political views.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  Twitter, just like Facebook, just like all these other Silicon Valley giants are now being increasingly brazen about the fact that conservatives are the enemy
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  and they want to extinguish us wherever they can, or even just libertarians, of course.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  But they're such classically the bad guys. And then they misrepresent what we've said to ban us.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  They banned you for making fun of the new women's ghostbusters.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  And the one thing they fear more than anything is humor. When we put something out really funny, that's when they blog.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  That's the one they go for. That's why they got me off Twitter.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  And it's interesting, my team on Facebook, we have a small team that runs the Facebook page.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  There's a couple of guys. They track this stuff for us. They try to pay attention to what gets suppressed.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  Small crew of Russians?
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  Yeah, just a small crew of Moscow mules.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  Everything's out of Moscow. They're magical. It's like a genie. If you have a Russian, you just go.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  I want millions of dollars and it kind of craps it out.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  It makes you just want to go just to upset them, just to get under their skin.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  I mean, Lauren Southern, I think, has gone over to Russia. I don't even know what she's doing over there.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  She's using that she's there. I think it's annoying people just being there.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  We should all do something to pilgrimage to Moscow.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  I want to go to Israel first.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  I've always wanted to go to Israel. It's so historic, but also they always accuse me of working for Israel because I don't want to blow Israel up.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  Plus, even if I headed Israel, which I don't, they have 200 nukes. They're not going to go away.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  That's another subject.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  Yes.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  I mean, what's becoming increasingly obvious is this nexus of established media, Silicon Valley companies, all the various powers in American establishment in civil society
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  are now rounding on anyone who is sufficiently brave to express an opinion that wanders outside of the major...
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  Which, by the way, not wanting to blow Israel up, just not hating Israel, how does the media go from being somewhat pro-Israel to like...
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  No, no, that's a hate crime now. Not describing Israel as barbaric, human rights violating, apartheid enforcing, conquering...
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  Well, of course, Israel is committing the ultimate historical sin, according to the left, which is colonialism, by conquering more lands around it.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  They're just as bad as...
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  And then everybody wants to end... Everybody wants to end to America or they want to end to Israel.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  Everyone wants to get away from Islam to turn it back into Islam.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  Everybody wants to get out of California to turn Austin into California.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  This is a country that is surrounded by aggressive, violent terrorists who are constantly hurling missiles across the border and all the rest...
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  And blowing their kids up.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  And here's my deal. The media never covers when the Arabs are killing each other by the millions, but then when a bunch of rioters are trying to break into Israel and some get killed, and I'm sad that happened, it's like...
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  35,000... they call them protesters, which we know is media code for left-wing riot.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  Oh, did you hear there was like four or five suicide bombers today, little kids that got blown up, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten years old. They're protesters.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  Oh, well, you know, if it went...
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  Poorly, one little girl like blew 30 feet in the air.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  When the Palestinians do this stuff, it is, of course, them reaching for desperate means to express themselves and to reclaim their historical heritage after the horrors have been inflicted on them.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  I'm just not going with them.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  I used to be more neutral on this, but now the whole leftist media, and George Soros has confirmed to want to destroy Israel, it's like, wow, I have the same enemies Israel does.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  Exactly. I was never really... I mean, you know, I'm Jewish, my mom's Jewish, but I was raised Catholic. I've never had a particular affinity for the Jewish faith or Jewish people enormously, especially.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  I was always fairly neutral on the Israel-Palestine question. I could kind of see bits of both sides.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  Me too.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  But when you... I got to say, we live in an era where you got to, you know, my enemy...
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  When I look at the massed ranks of the enemy, all the people who hate me, the people who hate me...
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  Billions of Muslims and everybody... how many... what is it? 40 million in Israel?
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  We got to blow Israel up this little tiny place, but Islam gets everything!
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  When I look at the hypocrisy and the double standards and the utterly uniform opinion about this country, and I see the same thing happening with respect to Israel that has happened to me and my friends and the people that I admire, it tells me very clearly who the bad guys really are.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  So, you know, sign me up. I'm a fully... I will be the last unreconstructed Zionist in America, if that's what it takes me upon.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  All I know is...
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  I'm in.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  Look at how the globalists want to take down George Washington's statues now. It's the same stuff here, man.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  It's communist garbage funded by billionaires. We'll be back with Milo.

[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long. Go ahead.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  I just have to say something, man. It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging. It just gets old, man.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay? We're taking calls about your nomination. Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm? If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out. I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down? Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000]  You know what, Alex?
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  Hey, I'll put him on pause again. Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  Much bragging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this. I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  You understand? I need your help, Frank. I need your help, Frank.

[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  You know, I've been trying to get Milo on for about three weeks since there was that viral video of him in New York, people chanting Nazi, Nazi, get out. So I just was reminded that. We'll play that in a minute and just get into this whole free speech issue.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  But that almost happens to me now when I go out. Most people shake my hand. A lot of classical liberals like me when I go to downtown Austin, but there's that trendy type that thinks it's a coming of age to get Alex Jones or get Milo Genopoulos.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  We'll talk about that and a bunch of other issues. And then I try to open the phones up some for Milo in the next hour. Before we go any further, we're talking about the article that they put out about Paul Watson and I and Paul Watson's taking my crown.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  I said, what do you think of that article, Milo? He said, let's drive a wedge between two dynamic duets. Well, of course, Paul knows that. I know that. But I went on and said, well, what about all these fake lawsuits? He goes, well, it's just that. It's just to drain you.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  That's why we're defeating these lawsuits. A bunch of them have been thrown out, but they follow more. That's why you've got to commit to get products you need.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  And to support the broadcast in a military operation in a free speech operation. This is an information war. We make it easy, folks. X2 is the purest iodine out there. Deep Earth crystal source.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  I told you they've only got enough of the crystals to do a few more runs. We think we're going to get another supplier and be able to continue to supply it. We only have one of these shortages once before the last five years.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  X2, the good halogen, back in stock. And I'm going to offer it for 25% off again because I want you to try it. Bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, 95% curcumin and 400 plus milligrams and it's got five other ingredients as well.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  That is 50% off. We've got the Icarin, liver and kidney cleanse. Amazing. Find out about it. 40% off. We've got all the high quality fluoride free toothpaste products. Those are 50% off, but that's got to end in a couple of days.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  And so does the special on DNA force. 50% off. So that is ending Wednesday. It's got to because both those products are very close to selling out and we won't get more in four months.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  So please think about us today. I want to thank all you that do financially support us, but it's where you get a good product at a great price back. You support free speech. You support America. You support trying to get free market back.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  You support standing up against the globalist. We've come so far together just five years ago. They still deny that was world government. Now they admit their world government is falling apart.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  We have come so far. Ladies and gentlemen, going back to Milo Inopoulos bestselling author of dangerous.com here with us as Mark Twain famously said rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated. They demonize you.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  They had fake PR stunts that you were over that you were destroyed. They banned you on Twitter, but you're still just turning along there. I'll get the word out.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  Well, just like you, I know that all of these things are designed to the piece about you and Paul, which is designed to sort of insinuate itself into your brain and kind of drive a wedge between two people who work brilliantly together.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  Both of whom combined reach a larger audience than either of you individually will be able to. It's designed to get into your head like a little worm and just sow the seeds of doubt. And if you let it, they want.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  And it says that I bully Paul. Yeah, I mean, I mean, it's the opposite. Paul's like a peer. And usually it's him calling me saying you've gone too far. I mean, by left wing standards, you speaking is bullying.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  By left wing standards, me speaking is bullying because we're saying something that upsets or disagrees and we're not constantly whatever. You know, when I worked for Steve Bannon, I know people have very different opinions about Steve and how he sort of lost his way or whatever.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  When I work with Steve, it was a pretty grueling experience. You know, he was a hard task master. He would scream, he would yell. I mean, he would fire people several times a day.
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  Rahim Qassam, the editor of Brightbot London, I think got fired four times in a day. He said, you're fired. I don't want to hear from you again. Two hours later, he's like, where's that story I asked for?
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  That's how a lot of very, you know, that's how a lot of like juggernaut highly demanding people in business and media are you, by comparison, are a charming pussycat compared to some of the people I've worked with. So obviously these allegations are real.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  I only blow up when I ask for little lower thirds for years. And I'm not going to get them. So it doesn't matter. Just a little something at the farthest screen that just says who I'm talking to.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  You know, when I blow up is like when my wife calls and then I got assigned something and then I like trip on cords and then and then someone else is there.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  It's like it's like it's a it's a it's a building thing. No, no, look, I'm just saying, you know, I rarely blow up in terms of what you read that article.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:10.000]  Well, the funniest thing is, remember, they finally released a Beavis and Butthead season after 20 years.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  No, I didn't see that.
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  Well, they've got one where Beavis and Butthead decide they've been sexually harassed because women women are telepathically wanting them. Yeah. And then they accuse the judge of that.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  Did you know this EOC complain against me? It says Jones never made homosexual advances. He was thinking it said he telepathically did it.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  This is this is I mean, that's the standard of proof. You know, it's just like, well, I'm just I'm sure he was thinking it. This is presumably where sexual harassment is going.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  No, I mean, you know, well, sure, what did my judge know when he that was like a couple years ago that came out? Like some friends with Mike, I got to talk to him.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  I've talked to him a while. But again, how did he put that out three years ago where it's now telepathic?
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:53:02.000]  Oh, yeah. Anyway, so in the respect of blowing up, losing your temper, having a hissy fit, you're like 0.1 bannons, so you do nothing to worry about.
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  Oh, it's like bannons. 0.1 bannons. Yeah, bannons is the bannons is the scale is the metric of hysterical temper tantrums. Anyway, you're nothing compared to that.
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  As the lawsuit stuff, it's just designed to all of your time is used up here so that none of your time can be used up, you know, building new shows, building new products.
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000]  We're trying to do.
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:31.000]  Of course, as you're always trying to do this stuff is not an accident. It's a strategy. It is designed to consume your time and most of all to consume your emotional energy.
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  Because each of us, even, you know, those of us who are.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  So the left or psychic vampires, let me ask you this. Why do they ruin everything they run? Why is everything about bullying when they're the biggest bullies?
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  Why are they such horrible people? I mean, they just never ends.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  Well, look, I mean, to my view on this is that in many cases, these social justice warriors become arbiters of other people's behavior because they're unhappy with their own. They become arbiters of other people's psychology because they have something defective about their own.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  These people want to make everybody else miserable because they themselves are suffering. And you can see that when I went into that bar in New York and I just went for a brunch.
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  I went for Chadwick Moore, who's on Tucker Carlson all the time. Another gay guy got fired, by the way, from the gay magazine he worked for, for writing a profile of me, which was insufficiently venomous.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  You haven't been mean enough about Myelinopolis, so you're fired. Works with me now. We just went in there for a brunch.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  Can you believe this? How far the left has moved from its previous mission of looking after minorities? Now they're getting between gay men and brunch.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:42.000]  We just went in there, wanted to have lunch, and 30 of these, like, harpies, these screaming mental, one of them was like a meat mountain. I think she was a woman.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  There's huge things charging at me. It was like being run at by a hill or something. I just didn't see my life flash before my eyes as this pink and purple pierced monstrosity.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  Are you sure it wasn't Grimace from McDonald's? It was like a full solo eclipse for a second, you know, just looming over. I was like, oh, that's it, that's it.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  And I noticed you're like trying to pay the tab, they won't let you. Nazi, Nazi, Nazi scum. I've had a good ending, I've had a good life, I've had a nice time, I've got a good car.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  Since you bring it up, let's go ahead and roll that tape from a few weeks ago. Here they are.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  Nazi scum, get out! Nazi scum, get out! Nazi scum, get out! Nazi scum, get out! Nazi scum, get out! Nazi scum, get out! Nazi scum, get out!
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  There's no reason to pause the video. Let's reload.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  What's the fun part about the library on TV? Let's reload the clip. Do we have the clip back?
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  What you could hear there, though, which is the important bit, is this sort of cultic, repetitious, you know...
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  And they're always fighting World War II with a Jewish gay guy. Everyone is a Nazi, except them.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  The Nazis were the ones that actually chanted and kicked Jews out of bars.
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  The irony is lost on them because they have this new, weird definition of white supremacy, anti-Semitism and white nationalism, which seems to boil down to do you like Trump or not.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  Let's try that clip again. Let's see if the second time's the charm. Here it is.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  Nazi scum, get out! Nazi scum, get out! Nazi scum, get out! Nazi scum, get out! Nazi scum, get out!
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  Nazi scum, get out! Nazi scum, get out! Nazi scum, get out! Nazi scum, get out!
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  This is very invasion of body snatchers.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  I knew that they would have gone on for hours if I just stood there.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.640]  stood there. And I thought, you know, I'll just be dignified and gracious. I didn't
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:43.280]  have security with me, which is my own stupid fault because I should know better than that.
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:46.200]  But I didn't want it to turn nasty. What the video they didn't post on the Internet was
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:49.320]  when they sort of made a wall. Some walls are good for some things.
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:51.040]  Well, that's what leftists do. They bump into you.
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:54.320]  Right. They just bumped, you know, just bumped, wasn't it? But of course they didn't post
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:59.560]  it. Anyway, I just, there's a serious point here, which is not me. I don't care. I'm a
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:04.880]  big guy. I can look after myself like I've, you know, resources and platforms and fortitude
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:08.440]  and all the rest of it. My worry is when people see stuff like that happening in real life
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:12.640]  or on the news, um, what happens to the ordinary Republicans and libertarians at home?
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:17.080]  Oh, it's meant to intimidate everybody and send a message. Let me ask you this question.
[01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:20.960]  We come back in two minutes. How did it start? I mean, like the one person spotted you and
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:25.320]  then ran over. Yeah, I just heard my name like one flying monkey. Yeah, I heard my name
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:29.920]  from somewhere else in the bar. And then I heard this woman say, let's do an action.
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:33.120]  Let's do an action. And then it also just spiraled out from there. We went out for a
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:37.160]  cigarette and they all started booing. You know, they started yelling and screaming booing.
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:40.800]  Then we could try to come back in. They would not allow us back to our table. That's how
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:44.760]  you fight Nazis. You should kick Jews out of restaurants. We'll be right back in the
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:51.680]  third hour. Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping between debt
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:57.840]  crisis, natural disasters or even simple power outages. Having a supply of storable meals
[01:57:57.840 --> 01:58:03.640]  is crucial. With InfoWars life select, storable food, you can make sure you and your family

[01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:49.360]  you need for an affordable price with InfoWars life select, storable foods. Western Europe
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:56.160]  has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:59:01.520]  the UK. They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or Gage, you'll
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:06.480]  get six months in prison. We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:11.480]  in the UK. CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:17.320]  web. Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship, brainwash young
[01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:23.000]  people against InfoWars. Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:27.680]  what we have to say. We are the most hated news source in the world by globalist. It
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:32.880]  is so critical that you go to infowars.com or slash newsletter and sign up for the free
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:37.800]  newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can bully their way in
[01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:43.480]  and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue as a society that is critical
[01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:50.480]  to this fight. We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:34.480]  All right, Milo's here with us. A couple segments left. We're going to go out and have an action
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:36.920]  today. I'm not going to say where, but we're going to take action.
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:37.920]  Do an action.
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:39.720]  We've got an order from the Russians. They said...
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:40.720]  Would you really?
[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:41.720]  Yeah.
[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:46.560]  Have you got one of those mini-tale things that the instructions from Putin come in on?
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:47.560]  It goes like...
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:52.680]  The political congressional hearing leaders. Jones, you once testified on television. You
[02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:56.080]  got orders. Now you're retrying. It's called a joke.
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:01:02.080]  A mini-tale from the Kremlin. They'll play the segment now.
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:06.320]  This is how they're going to get Trump. This is how they're going to get Trump because
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:16.760]  he speaks extemporaneously. He speaks in metaphor. He is exploring ideas as he's talking about
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:24.680]  them. He has that very loose manner of speaking. If you want to, if you are determined to deliberately
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:25.680] ...
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:28.160]  They're going to claim it's obstruction even though he jokes, but here's the good point.
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:31.880]  He's his own branch of government. So this whole tail wag the dog thing that if he lied
[02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:36.000]  to Mueller or Mueller says he's indicted, sorry, can't do that. It's all made up.
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:41.240]  Yeah. This is... If you're somebody who, like me, gives hours of interviews a day or like
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:46.360]  you, who is on the show for hours a day, and you speak extemporaneously and in an exploratory
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:51.880]  fashion just like the president does, it is easy for somebody determined with an axe to
[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:53.920]  grind to deliberately misrepresent you.
[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:56.720]  Sure. Meanwhile, they're the ones that lie to Congress about illegal spying. They're
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:00.400]  the ones running around total criminals in bed with the Russians. But this is a short
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:03.920]  segment. You told me something that I didn't know about you being thrown out of that New
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:08.880]  York pub slash, you know, restaurant when they were saying Nazi scum that they only
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:13.320]  showed the part where you left. They didn't show me or that they were, they were media
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:17.800]  people or that two of the people, and this, by the way, I had walked in unbeknownst to
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:22.040]  me to a local meeting of one of the New York Socialist Club, whatever, to...
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:24.040]  You'd walked into an SJW, a power nest.
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:26.040]  I did. And I didn't know. I swear I didn't know.
[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:28.640]  How dare you into a royal era?
[02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:34.120]  Well, it was in George Cross. Little did they know, white supremacist flag flew above them
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:37.440]  and prostrate yourselves immediately. I apologize.
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:39.920]  This is how I torture Watson, by the way.
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:45.240]  I know. This is the New York Socialist organization or whoever. What do they call themselves?
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:48.840]  In a bar called Church Hills, a drinking $6 craft ale.
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:52.360]  They don't even know that it's the St. George's Cross.
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:55.120]  All rich white kids, you know, who work and here...
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:58.240]  And they're so historically ignorant. Oh, it's even better. It's called Church Hills.
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:02:59.960]  I didn't even know that.
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:05.320]  These colonial hating socialists, like lunatics, in a bar called Church Hills drinking $6...
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:08.760]  Well, of course they were drinking craft ale because they're all lesbians, but...
[02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:11.160]  I love that, by the way. The lesbians think it matters. We have to talk about the lesbians.
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:13.760]  Oh, yeah. Can you guys get the media matters pulled out of the list?
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:16.240]  By the way, I love lesbians. I love women.
[02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:19.240]  I'm just asking why they all have horrible mullets.
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:21.960]  Especially in movies where they belong. Porn.
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:27.640]  May I ask you this? Why did mullets go out in the early 80s, but lesbians still have them?
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:32.640]  They're living in the glorious past of the 80s, where we all should still be.
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:36.640]  But no, the two things, before we go to the end, two things about this...
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:38.800]  Well, one thing, it's two people.
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:43.280]  One of the guys in this socialist group or whatever was a reporter for Gizmodo,
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:47.040]  which is the company that was formed out of the wreckage of Gorka.
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:48.400]  It's the leavings of Gorka.
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:53.080]  It is. The droppings. You know, is that when a dog gets hit by a truck and their guts splattered around the ground?
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:56.240]  Or like a donikabab that's made out of testicles and lungs, you know?
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:58.240]  It's like hot dogs, piano sausages.
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:02.240]  All the meat goes to like real people in restaurants, and then just all, you know,
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:06.240]  all the churned up stuff goes into those food trucks in university towns, you know?
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:08.240]  But one of them is from the nation.
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:11.240]  And the other one was a woman from the nation, which is...
[02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:13.240]  The nation at Churchill?
[02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:15.240]  At least according to that magazine.
[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:18.240]  No socialist would be caught in that outrageous area.
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:22.240]  What of America's most prestigious magazines, at least according to the nation?
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:25.240]  Would you like me to host the rest of the hours of British servant of the crown?
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:29.240]  I'll do Valley Girl if you do servant of the crown.
[02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:34.240]  When we return, I will do it in a Shakespearean rendition of Churchill.
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:36.240]  That sounds rowy, guys.
[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:41.240]  And when we return, and you will do it in the, oh my, oh, queue up that Valley Girl thing
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:43.240]  that they think we're all afraid of.
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:45.240]  The one where she goes...
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:52.240]  We've got to keep you on with us, though, when Omar Navarro comes on tour.
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:53.240]  Of course.
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:55.240]  No, you're not a socialist.
[02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:25.240]  We've got to keep you on with us, though.
[02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:55.240]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[02:05:55.240 --> 02:06:23.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:35.240]  I'm going to do this entire hour in a church killin' accent.
[02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:38.240]  It's not bad, actually. It's pretty good. It's not a bad...
[02:06:38.240 --> 02:06:41.240]  I mean, most Americans cannot do British accent.
[02:06:41.240 --> 02:06:44.240]  I hope they bring me my Scotch media, then.
[02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:49.240]  Most people in Britain do not speak like that anymore, but it wasn't a bad impression of a...
[02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:54.240]  I understand you. Get at the man. Get in there. The enemy.
[02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:58.240]  The enemy is here. How dare you?
[02:06:58.240 --> 02:07:00.240]  We shall fight them on Infowars.
[02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:04.240]  We shall fight them with growing confidence and strength in the air.
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:09.240]  And then even if this island was to fall, our great navy from seas across the globe
[02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:13.240]  would return to fight on and victory.
[02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:15.240]  There we go. Lovely.
[02:07:15.240 --> 02:07:16.240]  All right. Beautiful.
[02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:18.240]  This is a lot better than I do.
[02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:20.240]  And Watson doesn't behave.
[02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:22.240]  Is that the punishment?
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:24.240]  He'll call you up and you'll say, no, no, no, no.
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:28.240]  He'll get in your ear and the reward, his reward, is that you're a church...
[02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:30.240]  Only when he ignores me.
[02:07:30.240 --> 02:07:34.240]  And then I go, how dare you?
[02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:36.240]  He ignores you sometimes.
[02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:39.240]  See, I do the same thing when Owen doesn't return my calls.
[02:07:39.240 --> 02:07:43.240]  When Paul ignores me, that's when I finally get him.
[02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:46.240]  I go, now you will pay for what you've done.
[02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:48.240]  Tell me of the Admiralty.
[02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:52.240]  And then I make him talk like Emperor Palpatine to me.
[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:55.240]  How does Emperor Palpatine talk?
[02:07:55.240 --> 02:07:59.240]  Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy.
[02:07:59.240 --> 02:08:00.240]  That's good. That's good. That's good.
[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:03.240]  Very authoritarian, British accent.
[02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:07.240]  We are preparing to launch false flags against their operation.
[02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:12.240]  Then we will release diseases through the southern population
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:16.240]  before we bring down the hammer and crush their entire operation.
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:18.240]  That's going to be quoted in print.
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:22.240]  Already our operations are in control of their high command,
[02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:26.240]  steering the fall of Europe into total destruction.
[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:28.240]  Anyway...
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:30.240]  You like that?
[02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:32.240]  Yes, yes, Dad.
[02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:38.240]  I have a similar system of punishment with the lovely Eutroia from the war room.
[02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:42.240]  When he doesn't return my calls, I'll give him exaggerated cuddles
[02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:44.240]  and kisses and hugs in front of the crew backstage.
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:46.240]  Why don't you return my calls?
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:48.240]  You said we were really good friends.
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:50.240]  Now see, if I got in trouble for telepathically grooming,
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:51.240]  you'd have to stop it right now.
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:54.240]  Well, I don't work here, so he can't have me for sexual harassment.
[02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:56.240]  What am I telepathically doing?
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:08:59.240]  You're telling me to move on and we should talk about stories
[02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:01.240]  and not harass Owen Shroyer.
[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:02.240]  Yep, there we go. See?
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:04.240]  Brilliant. Anyone can do it.
[02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:07.240]  Is that what that does?
[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:09.240]  You know, I feel suitably chastised.
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:12.240]  No, no! I don't know what I was beaming there.
[02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:14.240]  Well, you were glamouring me, you know, like vampires.
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:17.240]  They can make you believe things that are not true.
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:20.240]  Like CNN. You know, it's hypnotised you.
[02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:23.240]  And after a while, you just start to believe things that couldn't possibly be true.
[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:27.240]  But getting serious, there is this girl called Sailor Pizza Girl.
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:28.240]  What's she called?
[02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:31.240]  Is this this thing Sailor Pizza Girl?
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:33.240]  Sailor Socialist.
[02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:35.240]  Sailor Socialist, yes. Tell us about her.
[02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:39.240]  Okay, they say, because I came in here like during the South by Southwest,
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:42.240]  we had so many videos, hundreds a day, I said, listen, put them on sub-channels.
[02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:44.240]  I go, how old are these videos? Like 30 of them.
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:48.240]  And they go, well, they've been up about 20 minutes, we just uploaded them.
[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:52.240]  I said, delete those, re-upload them on sub-channels and then we'll get more views.
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:58.240]  I walk out, it becomes this thing on NPR, CNN, Vice, that I am scared of this woman
[02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:01.240]  and then I finally watched it last week, it is hilarious.
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:08.240]  No, and this argument rests on the idea that you would post a video yourself
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:12.240]  on your own channel that embarrasses you somehow or that you're worried about
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:15.240]  and then delete it as though you wouldn't know what you were uploading
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:17.240]  on your own channel in the first place.
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:19.240]  This is the sort of straws they have to clutch at.
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:21.240]  But they don't even look at the video.
[02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:22.240]  No, they haven't.
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:23.240]  Have you seen it?
[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:24.240]  No, I've seen clips from it.
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:26.240]  It is devastatingly annoying.
[02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:28.240]  I have seen clips from it.
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:33.240]  When you talked about a valley girl, and she's like, it really hurt.
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:37.240]  And she's got her little fancy wannabe Japanese outfit on.
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:38.240]  It's called vocal fry.
[02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:39.240]  You know that?
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:42.240]  That's called vocal fry.
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:44.240]  That's a linguistic term.
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:45.240]  Wow.
[02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:47.240]  I guess I have it, but she has it in a weird way.
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:51.240]  And then she's wearing a Japanese cool girl outfit and then she's got a latte
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:53.240]  and she's got like a thousand dollar smartphone.
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:56.240]  She's at a three thousand dollar conference and she's sitting here going,
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:10:58.240]  oh, who wants, well, here, let's roll the tape.
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:10:59.240]  It's too powerful.
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:00.240]  We've got to roll it.
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:01.240]  Roll it.
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:06.240]  Hi, are you a fan of Bernie Sanders?
[02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:07.240]  Yeah, I am.
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:08.240]  What do you like about him?
[02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:10.240]  Um, that he's a socialist.
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:12.240]  Why is socialism good?
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:14.240]  Are you like, uh...
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:15.240]  Wow.
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:16.240]  Um...
[02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:18.240]  Because she's looking at the phone.
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:19.240]  What is this for?
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:22.240]  Um, we're asking people why they like Bernie Sanders.
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:24.240]  For info wars?
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:25.240]  Yes, we are info wars.
[02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:27.240]  Um, I think he has a lot of integrity.
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:30.240]  I like his value system, like what he stands for.
[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:31.240]  Exactly values.
[02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:33.240]  Um, eating the rich.
[02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:34.240]  Eating the rich.
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:38.240]  Well, are you aware that Bernie Sanders lives in three million dollar homes?
[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:40.240]  Uh, no, I was not aware of that.
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:41.240]  Yeah.
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:42.240]  And are you aware...
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:43.240]  I'm going to ask you something.
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:48.240]  Um, so if they're about eating the rich, why do you think so many of the 1% support socialism?
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:50.240]  Is that true?
[02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:51.240]  It's very true.
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:52.240]  Like who?
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:54.240]  Well, for example, you know Venezuela, right?
[02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:55.240]  I've heard of it.
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:12:02.240]  A majority of the country is currently eating rats while their politicians are drinking champagne on a daily basis.
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:10.240]  Um, but that's not the 1%.
[02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:12.240]  The 1% of Venezuela?
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:14.240]  I'm talking about America.
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:22.240]  Well, I'm saying since if Bernie Sanders were president, right, and he wanted to bring the same ideas for socialism into this country,
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:25.240]  do you think that would be a benefit?
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:26.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:29.240]  But I just told you Venezuela is getting rats.
[02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:32.240]  But I just want people to have healthcare, honey.
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:33.240]  I don't want like...
[02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:34.240]  Honey.
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:36.240]  Honey.
[02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:38.240]  Oh my God.
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:40.240]  Oh my, oh my God.
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:42.240]  Worms in your brain, honestly.
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:44.240]  Yeah, like worms in your brain.
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:46.240]  Is she high?
[02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:48.240]  Has she been smoking dope or something?
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:50.240]  You can have healthcare without socialism.
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:52.240]  I want people to have free healthcare.
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:54.240]  Why free?
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:58.240]  Because they think everyone has a right to have healthcare.
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:00.240]  So, so here's the deal.
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:04.240]  They think like this is their champion because they know they've got a bunch of dumb followers.
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:10.240]  They have to hold up idiocy like tires that blow out the first day you buy them is the best.
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:13.240]  And that is supposedly the video that like blows info wars out of the water.
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:14.240]  Well, that's the best they've got.
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:18.240]  I think you're doing okay because this is a woman who doesn't even know what socialism means.
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:22.240]  On one hand, she thinks she supports Bernie, Bernie Sanders because she wants everyone to have free healthcare.
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:23.240]  Well, that's not...
[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:30.240]  I mean, maybe that's quote unquote socialized medicine, but there are plenty of capitalist democracies that have, you know, single payer, whatever.
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:34.240]  Now, she's perfectly entitled to the view that, you know, that healthcare is a right.
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:35.240]  I don't think she's wrong.
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:36.240]  I think it's stupid.
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:37.240]  I don't think it works very well.
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:39.240]  And I think Canada and Britain prove that.
[02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:42.240]  She's entitled to that view, but that isn't socialism.
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:45.240]  But, you know, they've turned it into like a meme.
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:47.240]  This is her chat.
[02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:49.240]  Yeah, it's have worms in your brain.
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:52.240]  They've got like worms in your brain right now.
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:55.240]  But why do they hold up the dumbest people?
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:13:57.240]  This is like the epic takedown.
[02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:03.240]  You know, because I've been in a few of those epic takedown videos myself, but it's me doing the takedown.
[02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:09.240]  And normally it requires like a sassy put down, a fact they can't answer, a little bit of a rhetorical flourish.
[02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:11.240]  It requires you to utterly...
[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:13.240]  Yeah, there was no Perry Mason moment, nothing.
[02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:15.240]  This woman was a moron.
[02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:17.240]  Venezuela is eating rats.
[02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:21.240]  And the royal family, the communist family, now lives in Florida and Switzerland.
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:22.240]  You dumb witch.
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:23.240]  I don't know what to say.
[02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:25.240]  I really just want to healthcare.
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:29.240]  I just want it to be nice and...
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:32.240]  I got a $3,000 ticket to beer.
[02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:37.240]  And my boyfriend looks like, you know, a mid-level executive that drives down $1,000 of Audi.
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:43.240]  What was that terracotta colored blazer with those Oakley sunglasses and their thinning hair?
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:46.240]  I don't know, it could be a dad, it could be a boyfriend, it could be both.
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:48.240]  You know, there's this weird guy hovering around.
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:51.240]  It's like, these people are weird, deeply weird.
[02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:54.240]  And they have such outsized influence on the way that Americans are here.
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:57.240]  And they want to tell us, oh, it's all going to be free.
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:01.240]  We should show up and say, South by Southwest, we demand everyone be able to go free.
[02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:02.240]  I really believe...
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:05.240]  Because Louis Black, that's his fake name, that runs it.
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:09.240]  He thinks, you know, he's a beatnik that makes $100 million a year.
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:11.240]  I think it ought to be free.
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:15.240]  I believe that access to South by Southwest is a fundamental human right.
[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:18.240]  I think we should go outside and campaign for free entry for anything.
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:21.240]  And I think they should pay, have a clinic that pays for sex changes at it.
[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:23.240]  Any registered Republican.
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:26.240]  And I identify as a surgeon and I'll do it with a pair of loppers.
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:30.240]  Or there's garden secateurs, you know.
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:31.240]  Roll up, roll up.
[02:15:31.240 --> 02:15:32.240]  Head clippers.
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:35.240]  Seven speed electric head clippers.
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:36.240]  No, but I'm serious.
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:40.240]  I identify as a doctor and I say sex changes are free.
[02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:43.240]  I've watched the South Park video, I've seen them do it.
[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:45.240]  South by Southwest is going to fund your clinic.
[02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:47.240]  But you'll do the operations for free.
[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:50.240]  South by Southwest to offer free sex changes.
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:52.240]  Surgeon Jones, I'll use a weed eater.
[02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:54.240]  This is Canada and Texas today.
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:56.240]  Yes, Canada and Texas today.
[02:15:56.240 --> 02:15:58.240]  Were you born before the year 1956?
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:05.240]  If so, did you know you could be collecting between $575 and $2,200 in tax-free income right now?
[02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:07.240]  All thanks to the FHA.
[02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:08.240]  Or what about this?
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:13.240]  Did you know 54 U.S. congressmen have used a special tax-free account
[02:16:13.240 --> 02:16:16.240]  to earn up to 35 times more on their money?

[02:19:21.240 --> 02:19:26.240]  Thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:55.240]  Thank you.
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:20:25.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:26.240]  All right.
[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:27.240]  Getting serious here.
[02:20:27.240 --> 02:20:28.240]  Have a lot of fun with Milo.
[02:20:28.240 --> 02:20:29.240]  He's a smart guy.
[02:20:29.240 --> 02:20:31.240]  The Argentinian peso death spiral.
[02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:34.240]  Venezuela's election handouts are shrinking.
[02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:35.240]  Bloomberg.
[02:20:35.240 --> 02:20:37.240]  And it goes on from there.
[02:20:37.240 --> 02:20:40.240]  As Venezuela's exodus swells, more migrants face removal.
[02:20:40.240 --> 02:20:46.240]  So after a decade of socialism, an extra will be leading to communism.
[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:48.240]  They already ate their dogs and cats three years ago.
[02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:50.240]  Everything is hell on earth.
[02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:53.240]  A thousand plus people they estimate starved to death a week.
[02:20:53.240 --> 02:20:59.240]  And the answer is you've got to let the folks into this country now to immediately vote
[02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:06.240]  the same, to create the same paradigm and the same chain of events over and over and
[02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:10.240]  over again, the definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over again, taking
[02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:11.240]  a different result.
[02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:12.240]  Tough to imagine, isn't it?
[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:16.240]  That Venezuela's socialism has failed, given that it works so beautifully.
[02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:17.240]  Brilliantly.
[02:21:17.240 --> 02:21:18.240]  Everywhere else in the world.
[02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:20.240]  And every other time it's never been tried.
[02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:27.240]  I mean, socialism, communism, they have such a storied history of success across the world,
[02:21:27.240 --> 02:21:30.240]  no matter the continent, no matter the era.
[02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:34.240]  Socialism, communism have produced nothing but wealth, glory, human flourishing and happiness.
[02:21:34.240 --> 02:21:37.240]  They also always tell you how great Canadians and British healthcare are.
[02:21:37.240 --> 02:21:38.240]  They're horrible.
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:40.240]  We used to live over there.
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:42.240]  Why do you think I moved?
[02:21:42.240 --> 02:21:47.240]  No, I mean, the British press, if you think of it this way, you're trying to make an argument
[02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:49.240]  against socialized healthcare.
[02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:53.240]  The only data you have to go on as an American is what you can find about the British healthcare
[02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:54.240]  system.
[02:21:54.240 --> 02:21:57.240]  The British press is just as bad as the American press.
[02:21:57.240 --> 02:22:01.240]  All they're going to publish is the pro NHS stuff, except when it is so egregiously bad,
[02:22:01.240 --> 02:22:04.240]  like pensioners are dying by the thousands.
[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:07.240]  People are dying in hospitals because of the MRSA bug, because everything's so filthy.
[02:22:07.240 --> 02:22:11.240]  There's like a layer, an inch thick layer of grime on the floors of all these hospitals,
[02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:14.240]  and they sort of can't not report on it.
[02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:19.240]  And somebody who has attempted to use this service, I mean, of course there are individually
[02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:20.240]  brilliant doctors.
[02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:21.240]  There are all kinds of...
[02:22:21.240 --> 02:22:22.240]  That fight through the system.
[02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:23.240]  Exactly.
[02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:25.240]  But the bureaucracy, the amount of money...
[02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:28.240]  Well, I used to watch Prime Minister's questions even 20 years ago, and I still see it, and
[02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:33.240]  people get up and they go, this person had skin cancer, 100% operable, but that for two
[02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:34.240]  year wait died.
[02:22:34.240 --> 02:22:36.240]  And imagine, it's just eating you alive.
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:37.240]  They can just cut it off.
[02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:38.240]  They won't even do that.
[02:22:38.240 --> 02:22:41.240]  No, it's been going on since there's been an NHS, and the problem continues to get worse
[02:22:41.240 --> 02:22:42.240]  and worse and worse.
[02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:45.240]  And it isn't a problem of how it's exactly structured.
[02:22:45.240 --> 02:22:47.240]  The problem is the state's doing it.
[02:22:47.240 --> 02:22:49.240]  And when the state does it, it introduces more layers of complex...
[02:22:49.240 --> 02:22:51.240]  Just like the VA.
[02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:52.240]  Exactly.
[02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:57.240]  And then every time I run into one of these trendies, they go, socialism doesn't work,
[02:22:57.240 --> 02:22:58.240]  national health...
[02:22:58.240 --> 02:23:00.240]  But it does.
[02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:04.240]  If you look at the amount of money that is spent on the NHS, and what they actually
[02:23:04.240 --> 02:23:06.240]  managed to accomplish, that's not working very well.
[02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:12.120]  Well, Paul Watson, years ago, he had a strip throat for three weeks that was coughing blood
[02:23:12.120 --> 02:23:13.120]  up.
[02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:14.120]  And I said, have you gone to the doctor?
[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:19.720]  He goes, Alex, all they do is give me a pack of some Alka Seltzer and this and that.
[02:23:19.720 --> 02:23:20.720]  It wasn't even antibiotics.
[02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:25.720]  It was like Tylenol, and he had to beg them to get a referral to then go to the more
[02:23:25.720 --> 02:23:26.720]  elite doctors.
[02:23:26.720 --> 02:23:27.720]  Right.
[02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:28.720]  Explain how that works.
[02:23:28.720 --> 02:23:31.880]  Well, this is what Sarah Palin was talking about when she was talking about death panels.
[02:23:31.880 --> 02:23:34.760]  You know, you introduce this element of doctors kind of deciding who can and who cannot have
[02:23:34.760 --> 02:23:37.520]  treatment based on resources available because it's all blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:42.280]  This all boils down to a health service that does not have free market financial incentives,
[02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:48.960]  a way where you cannot take your consumer choice and pick what's going to work best for
[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:49.960]  you.
[02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:50.960]  And the American system is not perfect.
[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:51.960]  I think it's...
[02:23:51.960 --> 02:23:52.960]  Obamacare did in particular.
[02:23:52.960 --> 02:23:55.520]  Well, all the government funding has blotted it, just like education.
[02:23:55.520 --> 02:23:56.520]  It's gotten corrupt.
[02:23:56.520 --> 02:24:00.720]  Well, since Obamacare, I'm discovering now as I'm doing some corporate shuffling at
[02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:03.320]  the moment, and I'm like, okay, well, I have plenty of money in the bank.
[02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:04.320]  Where do I buy healthcare?
[02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:05.320]  And they're like, oh, you can't?
[02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:06.320]  To October?
[02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:07.320]  What do you mean, I can't buy healthcare?
[02:24:07.320 --> 02:24:08.320]  America, exactly.
[02:24:08.320 --> 02:24:11.680]  Like, I got married and I wanted to switch my wife over to my insurance.
[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:16.480]  She had to wait till October, like six months last year, and then run in and do it.
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:18.880]  No, and it's like, what do you mean I can't buy healthcare?
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:19.880]  How much do you want?
[02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:21.440]  Like, I'll write whatever check size it takes.
[02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:22.440]  What do you want?
[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:23.440]  $50,000?
[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:24.440]  $100,000?
[02:24:24.440 --> 02:24:25.440]  I need healthcare.
[02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:26.440]  It's a basic thing.
[02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:27.440]  I'll do that before I buy anything else.
[02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:28.440]  I'll move to a small house to have healthcare.
[02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:29.440]  Like, I need healthcare.
[02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:30.440]  And no, you can't buy it.
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:31.440]  So, I'm insane.
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:32.440]  But this is, as you say, correctly say, as a result.
[02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:33.440]  What an innovation.
[02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:34.440]  Public healthcare.
[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:35.440]  Obamacare.
[02:24:35.440 --> 02:24:37.680]  Obamacare now is for one month out of the year.
[02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:38.680]  Exactly.
[02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:39.680]  A public sector.
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:42.080]  This is a public sector the government interfering in what ought to be a private sector.
[02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:45.160]  And that's because the insurance companies don't want the big market open anymore.
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:46.160]  They want to kill the market.
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:52.080]  No, because these big companies are sort of allowed to run right in some respects.
[02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:54.720]  But it is an unholy alliance of big governments.
[02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:57.280]  By the way, you wanted to hit this because you saw it on our Twitter at RealAlex Showns.
[02:24:57.280 --> 02:24:58.280]  I hope you'll retweet it.
[02:24:58.280 --> 02:24:59.760]  Oh, I'm sorry, you're banned on Twitter.
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:00.760]  That's okay.
[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:02.000]  That makes sarcastic.
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  Look at those headlines.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.120]  Those are real headlines from the LA Times.
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:06.120]  It's a little raw.
[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:07.120]  It's a little raw.
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:08.120]  I was attacking them.
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:09.120]  Yeah.
[02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:10.120]  Sure.
[02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:11.120]  Well, it still hurt me.
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:12.120]  Do I need to bring back Churchill?
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:14.840]  Now, I don't have any special authority to talk on this story merely by virtue of being
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:15.840]  homosexual.
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:19.960]  But I can tell you that this story is the most shocking thing I've seen all year.
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:21.720]  And this is in a year of particularly shocking things.
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:26.400]  It is knowingly exposing others to HIV will no longer be a felony in California.
[02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:30.440]  So they're making it less of an offense, less criminal, less of a bad thing to do.
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:31.440]  To knowingly.
[02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:33.000]  Now, this is not some accidental thing.
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:38.000]  This is not you having an unprotected sexual encounter with somebody and unknowingly accidentally
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.320]  passing on the HIV virus.
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:42.240]  This is doing it on purpose.
[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:44.560]  Who even has time to spend on laws like that?
[02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:46.560]  How many people are doing this in California?
[02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:51.440]  Well, apparently enough that Democrat lawmakers in California think that it's worthwhile spending
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:56.200]  time making sure that people who go out and deliberately infect other people with the
[02:25:56.200 --> 02:25:58.920]  HIV virus are no longer committing felonies.
[02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:00.720]  So they're going to get shorter prison sentences.
[02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:01.720]  They're going to be in different jails.
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:04.320]  They're going to have a, you know, different, different, well, it's, it's like, it's just
[02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:05.320]  a misdemeanor.
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:06.320]  It's a ticket.
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:09.960]  And I predicted last year that you'd see skyrocketing STDs and I made the joke they'd
[02:26:09.960 --> 02:26:10.960]  say it was racism.
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:12.640]  They did exactly that.
[02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:13.760]  You know, it's funny.
[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:17.560]  You should say that October 6th, last year, knowingly exposing others to HIV will no longer
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:18.560]  be a felony in California.
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:23.400]  It says the LA Times fast forward to this year in the LA Times, May 7th says STDs in
[02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:26.080]  LA County are skyrocketing.
[02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:28.680]  Officials think racism and stigma may be to blame.
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:30.640]  This is a perfect example of liberals.
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:33.920]  You know, they try to get rid of stigma and allow people to spread it.
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:40.360]  Well, it's like this is leftists perpetuating toxic, disgusting, unhealthy behaviors.
[02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:43.840]  And then when we, when people go and engage in those behaviors, which of course people
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:47.040]  do when there aren't laws about them and the laws aren't being enforced, like the border,
[02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:49.480]  if you don't enforce the border, people are going to try and cross it.
[02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:53.160]  If you wouldn't, if we were to suddenly stop enforcing the murder law, there'd be a lot
[02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:57.320]  more murders just as there are when the number of police go down in Chicago and New York.
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:02.440]  And, you know, when, why don't they make it legal to spread hepatitis, but they virtue
[02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:03.440]  signal to HIV.
[02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:05.160]  Give it, give him a few weeks.
[02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:09.880]  You know, now that, now that the, the numbers of infections are of course going up because
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:15.120]  it is no longer such a serious thing to do to another person, this by the way is it wasn't
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:20.040]  until recently, until medication got better, effectively awarding them a death sentence.
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:23.040]  I'm not sure how morally distinct that is from, from killing somebody.
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:24.040]  And it still kills a lot of people.
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:28.200]  You're doing it exactly, you're just doing it more slowly, you know, and we're perfectly
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:29.200]  happy.
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:30.200]  And it's going to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:31.200]  Of course.
[02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:32.200]  So you're robbing them of their health?
[02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:34.800]  Well, Santa does it with, you know, pesticides and all the rest of it.
[02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:37.640]  We're perfectly happy to say that they are killing people slowly, but if you deliberately
[02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:40.920]  infect someone with HIV or you should get a less of a sentence, give me a break.
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:42.080]  Anyway, now at the rate.
[02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:45.160]  And I've read about these psychos that poke holes in the condoms and stuff, do you give
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:46.160]  it to women?
[02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:47.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:50.520]  Because they're making it all a gay thing, it's not just, it's a sex deal period.
[02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:51.520]  Not just the homosexuals.
[02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:56.040]  It is, you know, it is, it is all kinds of, of freaky wackos.
[02:27:56.040 --> 02:27:57.040]  What is the motivation?
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:28:01.200]  What is the psychology behind a Democrat who makes laws in California, spending time going
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:02.880]  to the office trying to get this passed?
[02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:05.560]  Can you imagine being Jerry Brown who was proud of it going, we're getting rid of the
[02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:09.520]  stigma of HIV, getting rid of the stigma, you crazy person.
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:10.520]  That's one thing.
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:11.920]  But getting rid of the stigma is one thing.
[02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:15.120]  Getting rid of the stigma might be, for instance, like trying to show that it's not a death
[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:18.960]  sentence anymore, saying that most infections are accidental, saying that it, blah, blah,
[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:19.960]  blah, blah.
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:23.800]  The stigma is not decriminalizing effectively, deliberately giving it away.
[02:28:23.800 --> 02:28:27.880]  Yeah, we're saying this can kill you, and then you deliberately spread other diseases,
[02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:28.880]  you go to prison.
[02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:29.880]  But this one you're allowed to.
[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:33.680]  And of course, ultimately, inevitably, they show, is it legalizing bug chasing?
[02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:34.680]  Yes, bug chasing.
[02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:39.960]  Well, yes, but it's, it's, it's, yeah, yes, but the person doing the deliberate infection
[02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:44.080]  is now no longer at risk of, of, of, of, that sounds psychotic.
[02:28:44.080 --> 02:28:47.960]  Let's finish up with this and then go to the home state of the mad dog.
[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:48.960]  She doesn't have HIV.
[02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:56.840]  She has rabies, the pig monster goblin herself, Maxine mad dog, what revenge on the common
[02:28:56.840 --> 02:28:57.840]  housefly?
[02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:03.600]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way, the bug assault,
[02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:09.440]  a miniaturized shotgun, which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition, non-toxic and no
[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:10.720]  batteries required.

[02:52:43.400 --> 02:53:03.200]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:53:03.200 --> 02:53:23.000]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:42.800]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:53:42.800 --> 02:54:02.600]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:54:02.600 --> 02:54:22.400]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:42.200]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:54:42.200 --> 02:55:02.000]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:21.800]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:41.600]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:55:41.600 --> 02:56:01.400]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:21.200]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:41.000]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:57:00.800]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:20.600]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:40.400]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:57:40.400 --> 02:58:00.200]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:20.000]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:39.800]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:58:39.800 --> 02:58:59.600]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:58:59.600 --> 02:59:19.400]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:59:19.400 --> 02:59:39.200]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:59:39.200 --> 02:59:59.000]  I have a right to my anger,
[02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:18.800]  I have a right to my anger,
[03:00:18.800 --> 03:00:38.600]  I have a right to my anger,
[03:00:38.600 --> 03:00:58.400]  I have a right to my anger,
[03:00:58.400 --> 03:01:18.200]  I have a right to my anger,

[03:04:16.400 --> 03:04:36.200]  I have a right to my anger,
[03:04:36.200 --> 03:04:56.000]  I have a right to my anger,
[03:04:56.000 --> 03:05:15.800]  I have a right to my anger,
[03:05:15.800 --> 03:05:35.600]  I have a right to my anger,
[03:05:35.600 --> 03:05:55.400]  I have a right to my anger,
[03:06:05.600 --> 03:06:31.400]  I have a right to my anger,
[03:06:31.400 --> 03:06:44.200]  Well, Alex, I'm calling in from an undisclosed location in the back room of a cigar store somewhere in South Florida where I have stumbled across extraordinary news.
[03:06:44.200 --> 03:06:55.200]  Now, as you know, I have always praised Facebook for their sophistication in terms of their ability to target your desired readers.
[03:06:55.200 --> 03:07:02.200]  And I have used Facebook very effectively in my campaigns to sell my various books.
[03:07:02.200 --> 03:07:06.200]  I got a call today from the campaign of Michael Williams,
[03:07:06.200 --> 03:07:33.200]  crusading pro-Trump state senator who is broken from the pack and is running for governor of Georgia. And his campaign manager told me that when they do their paid promotions on Facebook and they want to reach supporters of Info Wars or Alex Jones, a box pops up and says, as of May 24, those subscribers can no longer be accessed.
[03:07:33.200 --> 03:07:46.200]  I immediately checked on my own paid book promotions and indeed I can no longer reach supporters of Info or Alex Jones. I have the screen grabs on all of this.
[03:07:46.200 --> 03:07:52.200]  That's wild. So they literally don't want people's money who are trying to reach support.
[03:07:52.200 --> 03:07:59.200]  And let's explain. We're not being paid this money. Facebook's being paid and we're being totally isolated from everyone.
[03:07:59.200 --> 03:08:04.200]  And this happened, I will tell you, I can't name the website because we do do some business with them.
[03:08:04.200 --> 03:08:11.200]  But one of the biggest conservative websites in the world turned me down when I wanted to advertise my book with them a year ago.
[03:08:11.200 --> 03:08:15.200]  And then because conservative media is all struggling, they're all flailing around and frantic.
[03:08:15.200 --> 03:08:22.200]  They came back recently and offered us discounted CPMs like super cheap advertising when they wouldn't even take our money.
[03:08:22.200 --> 03:08:34.200]  When I attempt to post the Info Wars store link to buy my new book, Stoned Rules, in a Facebook ad, it is rejected for content.
[03:08:34.200 --> 03:08:35.200]  Rejected for content.
[03:08:35.200 --> 03:08:39.200]  Well, so we have been put into an electronic gulag. Well, I haven't announced this yet, but I'll do it now.
[03:08:39.200 --> 03:08:45.200]  They sell rebel flags, which is fine. They sell the learned elders of Zion where I don't agree with that.
[03:08:45.200 --> 03:08:49.200]  But, you know, books are books. They sell Hitler's mind comp at the local Barnes and Noble. That's fine.
[03:08:49.200 --> 03:08:57.200]  All of that can be sold, but they will not let us sell any of our products on their big merchant account system.
[03:08:57.200 --> 03:08:59.200]  And they said because of hate.
[03:08:59.200 --> 03:09:07.200]  And so here's this new book is like an etiquette book, which is new books that have got guide guide for life for their modern gentlemen, including, you know, some political rules.
[03:09:07.200 --> 03:09:08.200]  Yes, exactly.
[03:09:08.200 --> 03:09:13.200]  So you learn this from you learn this from Republican.
[03:09:13.200 --> 03:09:28.200]  For Governor Michael Williams, who has been on on Info Wars with us, who is a true patriot, running against country club Kegel, the Lieutenant Governor of Bushman in a hard fought primary.
[03:09:28.200 --> 03:09:35.200]  They credit Info Wars and the coverage they've gotten for as one of the major factors in this guy breaking out of the pack.
[03:09:35.200 --> 03:09:37.200]  He is the real deal.
[03:09:37.200 --> 03:09:45.200]  And so there it is. They don't want people politically getting access to hard charging Info Warriors who want to save the country.
[03:09:45.200 --> 03:09:49.200]  And so this is ahead of 2018, killing the base that they know beat Hillary.
[03:09:49.200 --> 03:09:51.200]  And that's why Trump should be concerned.
[03:09:51.200 --> 03:09:57.200]  And this is also about, of course, reducing the number of people who are going to get the messages they're going to propel them to vote for those candidates.
[03:09:57.200 --> 03:10:02.200]  This isn't just about strangling media organizations that they don't like.
[03:10:02.200 --> 03:10:03.200]  It's about strangling voters.
[03:10:03.200 --> 03:10:05.200]  It's about stopping voter turnout.
[03:10:05.200 --> 03:10:12.200]  The Democratic Party and Big Tech is beyond, you know, Jim Crow laws, guys with shotguns keeping blacks from voting.
[03:10:12.200 --> 03:10:14.200]  You never even know the people exist.
[03:10:14.200 --> 03:10:21.200]  They're breaking the link between candidates and the press and that candidates own supporters by preventing, you know,
[03:10:21.200 --> 03:10:24.200]  But Roger, isn't this serious campaign, you know, violations?
[03:10:24.200 --> 03:10:31.200]  Because, you know, the new thing in Buzzfeed is a new Facebook feature shows which pro Trump Facebook pages are run from overseas.
[03:10:31.200 --> 03:10:35.200]  Well, since there's no real Russia stuff, because Russia can't get its act together, I'm sorry, it's true.
[03:10:35.200 --> 03:10:40.200]  They say Alex Jones has a Facebook with 900,000 likes.
[03:10:40.200 --> 03:10:41.200]  Based in Switzerland.
[03:10:41.200 --> 03:10:43.200]  Based in Switzerland.
[03:10:43.200 --> 03:10:48.200]  Because Facebook told them, oh, someone's posting from there.
[03:10:48.200 --> 03:10:50.200]  Yeah, the American Dan Lyman.
[03:10:50.200 --> 03:10:52.200]  You know, we have a bureau in Europe.
[03:10:52.200 --> 03:10:54.200]  Wow, you really caught us.
[03:10:54.200 --> 03:11:02.200]  Yeah, no, you have 900,000 followers because you've earned every single one of them, but now they don't want anybody to be able to communicate with them.
[03:11:02.200 --> 03:11:03.200]  Yes.
[03:11:03.200 --> 03:11:05.200]  Listen, next time you, what is the president, here's the deal.
[03:11:05.200 --> 03:11:06.200]  What do we do?
[03:11:06.200 --> 03:11:07.200]  This is racketeering.
[03:11:07.200 --> 03:11:08.200]  This is anti-free speech.
[03:11:08.200 --> 03:11:10.200]  This is suppression of the vote.
[03:11:10.200 --> 03:11:13.200]  It's like you're trying to call somebody up and they like disconnect the lines.
[03:11:13.200 --> 03:11:14.200]  The same thing.
[03:11:14.200 --> 03:11:15.200]  What does the president do?
[03:11:15.200 --> 03:11:16.200]  What does Congress do?
[03:11:16.200 --> 03:11:19.200]  Because you see these tech giants get up in front of Congress, they play dumb.
[03:11:19.200 --> 03:11:21.200]  Like, I know nothing.
[03:11:21.200 --> 03:11:22.200]  I know nothing.
[03:11:22.200 --> 03:11:23.200]  What do we do, Roger?
[03:11:23.200 --> 03:11:25.200]  Well, we have two challenges.
[03:11:25.200 --> 03:11:36.200]  The largest one is getting the Republicans on the Hill, particularly the chairman of the subcommittee on telecommunications to understand this issue and understand that it violates antitrust.
[03:11:36.200 --> 03:11:38.200]  That's their vulnerability.
[03:11:38.200 --> 03:11:44.200]  But one thing the tech left doesn't want is specific exposure of their manipulation of the media.
[03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:47.200]  Please send this to Kit Daniels or Don Salazar, whoever.
[03:11:47.200 --> 03:11:54.200]  And the headline here is Facebook blocking Republican candidates from Republican voters.
[03:11:54.200 --> 03:11:58.200]  Because that's what, and they know info wars is big, they know we've got active people that care.
[03:11:58.200 --> 03:12:01.200]  Look, I mean, this is not a thing about, hey, this is a thing about politics.
[03:12:01.200 --> 03:12:08.200]  You have, by any measure, by any metric, one of the biggest radio shows, quote, you know, stroke internet shows in the country.
[03:12:08.200 --> 03:12:15.200]  You know, if it were a hateful, nonsensical, crazy, you know, kind of outfit, you would have a limit to the audience.
[03:12:15.200 --> 03:12:17.200]  You know, these anti-semitic...
[03:12:17.200 --> 03:12:24.200]  But the truth is, it is inclusive, it is funny, it is open, but they want to build a caricature of what we are, they can't have the real one exist.
[03:12:24.200 --> 03:12:28.200]  But the genuinely hateful stuff reaches a ceiling beyond which it does not grow.
[03:12:28.200 --> 03:12:32.200]  And you saw that with the alt-right, with the actually white nationalist and the actually anti-semitic and the actually hateful people.
[03:12:32.200 --> 03:12:33.200]  They hate us.
[03:12:33.200 --> 03:12:36.200]  They hate us, they hate you, they hate me, and they get to a certain size and can't grow beyond that.
[03:12:36.200 --> 03:12:41.200]  You have one of the biggest shows in the country, and they are identifying it as a source of...
[03:12:41.200 --> 03:12:48.200]  And let's be clear, this isn't money we'd make. This is a Republican candidate going, okay, we've won the primary, we're going to move forward.
[03:12:48.200 --> 03:12:51.200]  We want to contact the InfoWars activists.
[03:12:51.200 --> 03:12:53.200]  Facebook is turning money down.
[03:12:53.200 --> 03:12:54.200]  Yes.
[03:12:54.200 --> 03:12:55.200]  These aren't Russian bots.
[03:12:55.200 --> 03:13:04.200]  This is InfoWars trying to be contacted, and Facebook wants to smoke screen this, so they're releasing, well, somebody uploaded something from Switzerland.
[03:13:04.200 --> 03:13:10.200]  This is Facebook reaching the same levels of political bias at the expense of making money that Twitter arrived at.
[03:13:10.200 --> 03:13:12.200]  Well, this is the level of it. Let's say I went on...
[03:13:12.200 --> 03:13:15.200]  My wife wants to... Never been to Germany. She's part German.
[03:13:15.200 --> 03:13:19.200]  She wants to go for her birthday to Germany.
[03:13:19.200 --> 03:13:21.200]  Don't post anything on Facebook from Germany.
[03:13:21.200 --> 03:13:24.200]  I was about to say, if I was to post from the...
[03:13:24.200 --> 03:13:28.200]  The Germans are in control because it's all data stamped.
[03:13:28.200 --> 03:13:33.200]  Hey, did you know you're under Swiss control, Roger? I didn't know the Swiss were running us.
[03:13:33.200 --> 03:13:35.200]  I think people need to see this in context now.
[03:13:35.200 --> 03:13:39.200]  This is part of the same war on censorship that they are running against us.
[03:13:39.200 --> 03:13:56.200]  This is connected directly to the phony, frivolous, but expensive lawsuits against you and me that are designed, even though they're baseless, to generate a negative headline that they then can use as a rationale to turn around and limit our reach on Facebook.
[03:13:56.200 --> 03:13:57.200]  It's the same campaign.
[03:13:57.200 --> 03:13:59.200]  Well, exactly. And we've got to get...
[03:13:59.200 --> 03:14:02.200]  Because we're putting EuropeWars.com on Facebook in Europe.
[03:14:02.200 --> 03:14:07.200]  We've got to get the evil mastermind, Lex Luthor, aka damn lineman, on tomorrow.
[03:14:07.200 --> 03:14:12.200]  I mean, this evil person goes and shoots videos. He interviews people. He writes articles.
[03:14:12.200 --> 03:14:15.200]  An American in Europe is reporting Milo. We must stop this.
[03:14:15.200 --> 03:14:23.200]  I just wonder what will happen when the BBC's Russia bureau that is based in Moscow starts posting stories about...
[03:14:23.200 --> 03:14:30.200]  Not just Americans talking about America, who happen to be based in Switzerland, but BBC journalists from England in Russia talking about Russia.
[03:14:30.200 --> 03:14:32.200]  I'm sure that's going to get flagged by Facebook, isn't it?
[03:14:32.200 --> 03:14:35.200]  How do they think they're going to get away with this, Roger? This is so stupid.
[03:14:35.200 --> 03:14:42.200]  Well, the president needs to direct his assistant attorney, Jennifer, in our trust, to start reviewing the issues here.
[03:14:42.200 --> 03:14:48.200]  On the other hand, he doesn't seem to have much control over the justice department, as long as he's run by Mr. Rosenstein.
[03:14:48.200 --> 03:14:50.200]  What he needs to do, I think, is pretty obvious.
[03:14:50.200 --> 03:14:56.200]  Yeah, exactly. And then, meanwhile, you've got the daughtering, probably KKK grand dragon over there.
[03:14:56.200 --> 03:15:01.200]  Doesn't even know what planet he's on. Like, 50 years from now on, I'm here!
[03:15:01.200 --> 03:15:08.200]  Sadly, I say he's either compromised or he's senile. It's one or the other.
[03:15:08.200 --> 03:15:13.200]  I say death penalty for dope! I'm sessions and I sit so...
[03:15:13.200 --> 03:15:19.200]  He's like the great grandfather you see at Thanksgiving, you know, who you just sort of let ramble for a bit.
[03:15:19.200 --> 03:15:22.200]  I got my kids blown off at WW2!
[03:15:22.200 --> 03:15:27.200]  Nobody actually does what he says. You just let him talk for a bit. We have him running the justice department.
[03:15:27.200 --> 03:15:31.200]  We have appointed five-horned leg-horned to be attorney general.
[03:15:31.200 --> 03:15:37.200]  I say, I say, I say, we're going to put the president in jail, but you get that marijuana, you go to prison too!
[03:15:37.200 --> 03:15:45.200]  I say, Roger's back on! Roger's back on with the war room in 45 minutes, but straight ahead is the great Gerald Salente,

[03:17:16.200 --> 03:17:34.200]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer. Finally, someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever.
[03:17:34.200 --> 03:17:40.200]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.

[03:19:24.200 --> 03:19:32.200]  Thank you so much, Alex, for the Infowars Life products. They are quality. I can't wait to get some more.
[03:19:32.200 --> 03:19:35.200]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[03:19:35.200 --> 03:19:36.200]  Absolutely.
[03:19:36.200 --> 03:19:44.200]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on,
[03:19:44.200 --> 03:19:54.200]  and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:20:15.200 --> 03:20:26.200]  Hey, thanks for having me, Alex. It's always great being on Infowars to get the real news.
[03:20:26.200 --> 03:20:30.200]  And Alex asked me, what's on our radar?
[03:20:30.200 --> 03:20:38.200]  And what's on our radar, as I said, we're very concerned about an explosive situation in the Middle East.
[03:20:38.200 --> 03:20:45.200]  And as you know, Gerald Sollenties, GCs, 3Gs, guns, gold, and a getaway plan.
[03:20:45.200 --> 03:20:50.200]  I tell the story what happened on 9-11, and this thing was going to escalate.
[03:20:50.200 --> 03:20:53.200]  I was all set, as everybody was freaking out.
[03:20:53.200 --> 03:21:02.200]  And we could have that kind of incident happen, and worse, in this new age of new millennium warfare.
[03:21:02.200 --> 03:21:14.200]  So, you know, one of the products to consider is that survival shield X2, survival, you got it?
[03:21:14.200 --> 03:21:19.200]  And that's what this is going to be about, survival of the fittest.
[03:21:19.200 --> 03:21:37.200]  Again, you have a new shipment of survival shield X2, 25% off, and bio true selenium, 50% off in bio true X2 combo.
[03:21:37.200 --> 03:21:46.200]  They've received a brand new shipment of its incredibly hard to source survival shield X2
[03:21:46.200 --> 03:21:55.200]  and decided, because you guys and women listening to info was 25% off.
[03:21:55.200 --> 03:21:58.200]  So, get your supply today.
[03:21:58.200 --> 03:22:02.200]  As I say, prepare for the worst.
[03:22:02.200 --> 03:22:07.200]  If the worst doesn't happen and you prepared for it, what'd you lose?
[03:22:07.200 --> 03:22:15.200]  But if the worst happens and you didn't prepare for it, you could lose everything.
[03:22:15.200 --> 03:22:24.200]  And listening to Alex and Roger Stone talking about Facebook, I have to tell you what puzzles me a lot.
[03:22:24.200 --> 03:22:38.200]  Once upon a time, not too long ago, there was a site called MySpace, and MySpace is up in space, gone, zipped.
[03:22:38.200 --> 03:22:52.200]  The same thing can happen to Facebook, and what I keep thinking about is how come no one has tried to take them out with a more advanced enlightened system.
[03:22:52.200 --> 03:23:01.200]  And of course, Facebook and all the others are censoring, because they're all part of the same group.
[03:23:01.200 --> 03:23:09.200]  You know, when you look at the numbers, I've got to go onto all these websites to see what's going on.
[03:23:09.200 --> 03:23:20.200]  And I go on to CNN, and I'm reading, and all of a sudden, bam, this full page of Anderson Cooper, his photo, keeps popping up.
[03:23:20.200 --> 03:23:22.200]  I don't want to look at this guy.
[03:23:22.200 --> 03:23:27.200]  Now, remember, this is a country of what, 320 million people?
[03:23:27.200 --> 03:23:30.200]  How many people watch this guy?
[03:23:30.200 --> 03:23:36.200]  Remember, Alex shows us 900,000 fans.
[03:23:36.200 --> 03:23:44.200]  This guy doesn't just about get 900,000 views at prime time, in a country of 320 million people.
[03:23:44.200 --> 03:23:56.200]  So a very, very small group is controlling the information that we're getting, and when they give it to us, they fill it with propaganda.
[03:23:56.200 --> 03:24:01.200]  And nothing could be clearer than this.
[03:24:01.200 --> 03:24:05.200]  This is from the Weekend Edition of the Wall Street Journal.
[03:24:05.200 --> 03:24:10.200]  Look at that photo, huh?
[03:24:10.200 --> 03:24:16.200]  Putin is an evil man.
[03:24:16.200 --> 03:24:22.200]  What kind of person would write something like that, being a writer?
[03:24:22.200 --> 03:24:25.200]  I would never write anything like that.
[03:24:25.200 --> 03:24:28.200]  How about Think For Yourself?
[03:24:28.200 --> 03:24:30.200]  So who wrote this?
[03:24:30.200 --> 03:24:33.200]  John McCain.
[03:24:33.200 --> 03:24:36.200]  Or has I been calling him for many years?
[03:24:36.200 --> 03:24:38.200]  John Insane McCain.
[03:24:38.200 --> 03:24:41.200]  I don't want Trump coming to my funeral.
[03:24:41.200 --> 03:24:43.200]  Grow up!
[03:24:43.200 --> 03:24:45.200]  What do you think, somebody?
[03:24:45.200 --> 03:24:47.200]  Oh, I can't wait to go to your funeral.
[03:24:47.200 --> 03:24:50.200]  Probably doesn't want to go anyway.
[03:24:50.200 --> 03:24:55.200]  And you're dead, Jack. Once you're gone, man, forget it.
[03:24:55.200 --> 03:24:58.200]  I know, you're going to leave a legacy.
[03:24:58.200 --> 03:25:01.200]  Yeah, a legacy of lies and madness.
[03:25:01.200 --> 03:25:06.200]  Long before Trump said it, I've been saying it for years.
[03:25:06.200 --> 03:25:09.200]  This guy's no war hero.
[03:25:09.200 --> 03:25:13.200]  This plane got shot down bombing innocent people.
[03:25:13.200 --> 03:25:21.200]  A loser of a guy be nowhere if granddaddy and daddy weren't admirals in the Navy.
[03:25:21.200 --> 03:25:25.200]  Yeah, you remember when he crashed his planes?
[03:25:25.200 --> 03:25:29.200]  All this guy does is take us to war.
[03:25:29.200 --> 03:25:31.200]  An evil man?
[03:25:31.200 --> 03:25:38.200]  Hey, look at that.
[03:25:38.200 --> 03:25:41.200]  Look what Russia did to Libya, huh?
[03:25:41.200 --> 03:25:43.200]  Boy, that lousy Putin.
[03:25:43.200 --> 03:25:46.200]  And they gave him a Nobel Peace Prize.
[03:25:46.200 --> 03:25:48.200]  Oh, that was Obama.
[03:25:48.200 --> 03:25:50.200]  Quote, I'm really good at killing people.
[03:25:50.200 --> 03:25:56.200]  Does that make you evil, John Insane McCain?
[03:25:56.200 --> 03:26:00.200]  You were a mongering freak of a guy.
[03:26:00.200 --> 03:26:03.200]  Not a war hero, a victim.
[03:26:03.200 --> 03:26:06.200]  Your plane got shot down.
[03:26:06.200 --> 03:26:10.200]  That does not make you a hero.
[03:26:10.200 --> 03:26:14.200]  And from the Bronx again, a hero is a sailage.
[03:26:14.200 --> 03:26:19.200]  I never associate that with you, but anyway.
[03:26:19.200 --> 03:26:22.200]  This is the propaganda.
[03:26:22.200 --> 03:26:25.200]  You talking about Facebook?
[03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:29.200]  It's one after another.
[03:26:29.200 --> 03:26:33.200]  Oh, how about little Georgie Bush?
[03:26:33.200 --> 03:26:37.200]  Hey, go back and watch those videos of him.
[03:26:37.200 --> 03:26:40.200]  Right after 9-11.
[03:26:40.200 --> 03:26:45.200]  You want to see an insincere nothing of a nobody
[03:26:45.200 --> 03:26:50.200]  reading his script without an ounce of emotion?
[03:26:50.200 --> 03:26:53.200]  How about that for an evil man?
[03:26:53.200 --> 03:26:57.200]  Oh, you like the Afghan war?
[03:26:57.200 --> 03:27:00.200]  Yeah.
[03:27:00.200 --> 03:27:06.200]  UN finds Afghan attack hit children the hardest.
[03:27:06.200 --> 03:27:10.200]  US report, these are just recent days,
[03:27:10.200 --> 03:27:15.200]  points to setbacks in Afghanistan.
[03:27:15.200 --> 03:27:21.200]  A government to name only in an Afghan city.
[03:27:21.200 --> 03:27:28.200]  15 die in Afghan attacks as Taliban makes gains, huh?
[03:27:28.200 --> 03:27:29.200]  An evil man?
[03:27:29.200 --> 03:27:30.200]  Wait a minute.
[03:27:30.200 --> 03:27:36.200]  In one week, Taliban kills about 100 Afghan soldiers
[03:27:36.200 --> 03:27:38.200]  and police officers.
[03:27:38.200 --> 03:27:44.200]  John and St. McCain and all the other freaks that took us to war.
[03:27:44.200 --> 03:27:46.200]  Taliban didn't do anything to us.
[03:27:46.200 --> 03:27:47.200]  Oh, wait a minute.
[03:27:47.200 --> 03:27:50.200]  Weren't those Saudis allegedly on the plane?
[03:27:50.200 --> 03:27:52.200]  Oh, yeah, the clown prince was here
[03:27:52.200 --> 03:27:56.200]  and he rolled out the red carpet and saluted them.
[03:27:56.200 --> 03:27:58.200]  Taliban didn't do anything.
[03:27:58.200 --> 03:28:02.200]  They were hiding bin Laden, I says.
[03:28:02.200 --> 03:28:04.200]  You want to talk about evil men?
[03:28:04.200 --> 03:28:06.200]  There's a whole long list of them.
[03:28:06.200 --> 03:28:08.200]  I forgot Slick Willie Clinton.
[03:28:08.200 --> 03:28:09.200]  Yep.
[03:28:09.200 --> 03:28:15.200]  Every time that cat would get in trouble, boom,
[03:28:15.200 --> 03:28:17.200]  bombs away over a rock.
[03:28:17.200 --> 03:28:19.200]  But that people forget that.
[03:28:19.200 --> 03:28:22.200]  Killed over 500,000 people.
[03:28:22.200 --> 03:28:27.200]  Madeleine Albright said it was worth the price of sanction.
[03:28:27.200 --> 03:28:31.200]  And that's the way it is.
[03:28:31.200 --> 03:28:34.200]  We'll be back in a little bit for a lot more.
[03:28:34.200 --> 03:29:03.200]  The past of the future.
[03:29:04.200 --> 03:29:07.200]  We'll be back in a little bit for a little bit more.
[03:29:35.200 --> 03:29:38.200]  If you're at or near retirement, this book is a must read.
[03:29:38.200 --> 03:29:40.200]  You can get your own free copy.
[03:29:40.200 --> 03:29:42.200]  Shipping and handling charges apply.
[03:29:42.200 --> 03:29:46.200]  Just go to 501Kbook.com right now while there are still copies left.
[03:29:46.200 --> 03:29:50.200]  That's 501Kbook.com, 501Kbook.com.
[03:29:50.200 --> 03:30:15.200]  Just go to 501Kbook.com right now.
[03:30:20.200 --> 03:30:22.200]  We'll be back in a little bit for a little bit more.
[03:30:50.200 --> 03:30:55.200]  We've taken thousands of years of known research
[03:30:55.200 --> 03:30:59.200]  and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing
[03:30:59.200 --> 03:31:02.200]  to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[03:31:02.200 --> 03:31:03.200]  to detoxify the body.
[03:31:03.200 --> 03:31:05.200]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield.
[03:31:05.200 --> 03:31:08.200]  Toxic, metal, and chemical defense support.
[03:31:08.200 --> 03:31:10.200]  It's made in the USA.
[03:31:10.200 --> 03:31:12.200]  It's filled with known compounds from nature
[03:31:12.200 --> 03:31:15.200]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[03:31:15.200 --> 03:31:17.200]  and it supports the infomer.
[03:31:17.200 --> 03:31:19.200]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:31:19.200 --> 03:31:23.200]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year
[03:31:23.200 --> 03:31:26.200]  and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[03:31:26.200 --> 03:31:29.200]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:31:29.200 --> 03:31:31.200]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
[03:31:31.200 --> 03:31:34.200]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[03:31:34.200 --> 03:31:38.200]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[03:31:38.200 --> 03:31:41.200]  because we need you, the remnant of America,
[03:31:41.200 --> 03:31:44.200]  to reignite those brush fires the next level
[03:31:44.200 --> 03:31:46.200]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:31:46.200 --> 03:31:49.200]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[03:31:49.200 --> 03:31:51.200]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield
[03:31:51.200 --> 03:32:20.200]  InfoWarsLife.com
[03:32:21.200 --> 03:32:23.200]  Thank you so much for watching this video.
[03:32:23.200 --> 03:32:52.200]  I hope you enjoyed it.
[03:32:53.200 --> 03:33:00.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:00.200 --> 03:33:24.200]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[03:33:24.200 --> 03:33:32.200]  in the heart of the resistance is Alex Jones.
[03:33:32.200 --> 03:33:35.200]  That's almost Alex Jones.
[03:33:35.200 --> 03:33:38.200]  Anyway, it's me, Gerald Celenti.
[03:33:38.200 --> 03:33:43.200]  Great being on InfoWars and having this opportunity
[03:33:43.200 --> 03:33:47.200]  to put out information that will help you plan ahead
[03:33:47.200 --> 03:33:50.200]  because that's what we do in trend forecasting.
[03:33:50.200 --> 03:33:53.200]  Current events form future trends.
[03:33:53.200 --> 03:33:55.200]  I was talking about what's going on in the Middle East
[03:33:55.200 --> 03:33:58.200]  and the concerns that we have that are growing.
[03:33:58.200 --> 03:34:03.200]  And again, the nation cannot take a spike in oil prices.
[03:34:03.200 --> 03:34:07.200]  You go back to 2007.
[03:34:07.200 --> 03:34:08.200]  What happened after that?
[03:34:08.200 --> 03:34:10.200]  The panic of 08.
[03:34:10.200 --> 03:34:12.200]  What were gasoline prices?
[03:34:12.200 --> 03:34:17.200]  Well, a barrel oil was selling around 150 bucks.
[03:34:17.200 --> 03:34:21.200]  Go back to the dot-com bust.
[03:34:21.200 --> 03:34:23.200]  Oh, yeah.
[03:34:23.200 --> 03:34:28.200]  Oil prices were spiking just before the bust.
[03:34:28.200 --> 03:34:32.200]  You keep going back and you can see the trend,
[03:34:32.200 --> 03:34:37.200]  tracking trends as a way of seeing where we are
[03:34:37.200 --> 03:34:41.200]  and how we got here to see where we're going.
[03:34:41.200 --> 03:34:45.200]  If oil prices start to spike,
[03:34:45.200 --> 03:34:50.200]  and now Brent Crude is approaching that $80 mark,
[03:34:50.200 --> 03:34:56.200]  start forecasting if oil hits $100 a barrel,
[03:34:56.200 --> 03:34:59.200]  kiss the economy goodbye.
[03:34:59.200 --> 03:35:04.200]  And those equity markets, bye-bye.
[03:35:04.200 --> 03:35:07.200]  Guns, gold, and a getaway plan.
[03:35:07.200 --> 03:35:09.200]  On to the gold.
[03:35:09.200 --> 03:35:16.200]  Story just came out showing gold miners hit by fears.
[03:35:16.200 --> 03:35:22.200]  Again, all things are connected in our global economic system
[03:35:22.200 --> 03:35:27.200]  of rising oil prices.
[03:35:27.200 --> 03:35:32.200]  It's costing them more to get it out of the ground.
[03:35:32.200 --> 03:35:39.200]  So now we have oil at around, again, approaching that $80 barrel mark.
[03:35:39.200 --> 03:35:43.200]  And we got gold flirting around the 1300 mark.
[03:35:43.200 --> 03:35:47.200]  The downside risk of gold is we see it as forecasters.
[03:35:47.200 --> 03:35:49.200]  We don't sell gold.
[03:35:49.200 --> 03:35:55.200]  We don't give financial advice with trend forecasters.
[03:35:55.200 --> 03:36:00.200]  And the Trends Journal motto, as you know, is think for yourself.
[03:36:00.200 --> 03:36:05.200]  We see $100 downside because as the price keeps going up
[03:36:05.200 --> 03:36:07.200]  to pull it out of the ground,
[03:36:07.200 --> 03:36:12.200]  they're not going to pull it out of the ground and lose money.
[03:36:12.200 --> 03:36:19.200]  So we would suggest that the downside risk is $100 max.
[03:36:19.200 --> 03:36:22.200]  Again, you've heard me say this before.
[03:36:22.200 --> 03:36:28.200]  Gold has to break over the $1,385 an ounce mark.
[03:36:28.200 --> 03:36:33.200]  When it breaks over that, the next one's $1,450.
[03:36:33.200 --> 03:36:40.200]  When it breaks past the $1,450, boom, a Bitcoin bounce.
[03:36:40.200 --> 03:36:46.200]  Meaning that from very low to very high, over 2,000.
[03:36:46.200 --> 03:36:54.200]  And with the destabilization happening now, again, think for yourself.
[03:36:54.200 --> 03:37:02.200]  But for me, it's a golden game to put it into perspective.
[03:37:02.200 --> 03:37:07.200]  They just had an election over there in Iraq.
[03:37:07.200 --> 03:37:10.200]  You remember that war based on lies.
[03:37:10.200 --> 03:37:19.200]  Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda.
[03:37:19.200 --> 03:37:22.200]  And again, you know, I put my money where my heart is.
[03:37:22.200 --> 03:37:24.200]  I launched Occupy Peace.
[03:37:24.200 --> 03:37:31.200]  So when I talk about peace, they're not empty words.
[03:37:31.200 --> 03:37:33.200]  A war based on lies.
[03:37:33.200 --> 03:37:35.200]  How about that evil Putin, huh?
[03:37:35.200 --> 03:37:38.200]  How about dick chaining?
[03:37:38.200 --> 03:37:40.200]  Or to be proper penis chaining?
[03:37:40.200 --> 03:37:44.200]  Because I don't want to get, you know, call him a dick.
[03:37:44.200 --> 03:37:46.200]  And that's really it.
[03:37:46.200 --> 03:37:48.200]  So I got to be proper.
[03:37:48.200 --> 03:37:52.200]  The lies from him.
[03:37:52.200 --> 03:37:54.200]  You know, people learn to hate Iran.
[03:37:54.200 --> 03:37:57.200]  They don't know their history.
[03:37:57.200 --> 03:38:00.200]  Go back not even too long ago.
[03:38:00.200 --> 03:38:04.200]  Ten years before they started the Iraq war, George Bush did.
[03:38:04.200 --> 03:38:07.200]  His father, the first Iraq war,
[03:38:07.200 --> 03:38:10.200]  Donald Rumsfeld, a little, little nothing boy,
[03:38:10.200 --> 03:38:13.200]  little clown of a jerk.
[03:38:13.200 --> 03:38:17.200]  Even Saddam Hussein, those golden spurs
[03:38:17.200 --> 03:38:20.200]  to launch a war against Iran in 1980.
[03:38:20.200 --> 03:38:22.200]  People don't know that one.
[03:38:22.200 --> 03:38:24.200]  Yeah, I wonder why they don't like Americans.
[03:38:24.200 --> 03:38:25.200]  Can't figure it out.
[03:38:25.200 --> 03:38:29.200]  Well, it couldn't be the 1953 overthrow of Mosaddeg,
[03:38:29.200 --> 03:38:32.200]  the democratically elected government.
[03:38:32.200 --> 03:38:35.200]  Anyway, the reports came out last year
[03:38:35.200 --> 03:38:38.200]  and they finally released them from the CIA,
[03:38:38.200 --> 03:38:43.200]  but it never made the U.S. news on how Winston Churchill
[03:38:43.200 --> 03:38:50.200]  and the MI6 persuaded the United States and the CIA
[03:38:50.200 --> 03:38:53.200]  to foster the elveth throw of Mosaddeg
[03:38:53.200 --> 03:38:56.200]  and bring in the Shah, the dictator.
[03:38:56.200 --> 03:39:01.200]  But going back to gold and where we are with oil prices,
[03:39:01.200 --> 03:39:07.200]  the way it's destabilizing now
[03:39:07.200 --> 03:39:10.200]  and seeing what's going on,
[03:39:10.200 --> 03:39:13.200]  it looks like they're taking us to war.
[03:39:13.200 --> 03:39:19.200]  And going back to the Iraq war that was based on lies,
[03:39:19.200 --> 03:39:23.200]  top populist cleric who fought U.S. troops
[03:39:23.200 --> 03:39:29.200]  is winning Iraq's election.
[03:39:29.200 --> 03:39:31.200]  The numbers are still coming in after polls
[03:39:31.200 --> 03:39:34.200]  closed over the weekend in Iraq's first election
[03:39:34.200 --> 03:39:39.200]  since defeating the Islamic State last year.
[03:39:39.200 --> 03:39:42.200]  And they're pointing to a shock wind
[03:39:42.200 --> 03:39:47.200]  for a firebrand Iraqi cleric
[03:39:47.200 --> 03:39:52.200]  who wasn't even running for prime minister
[03:39:52.200 --> 03:39:55.200]  along with his coalition allies,
[03:39:55.200 --> 03:40:02.200]  the Iraqi Communist Party.
[03:40:02.200 --> 03:40:05.200]  All right, there's no victory in these wars
[03:40:05.200 --> 03:40:10.200]  and they're just heating up one after another.
[03:40:10.200 --> 03:40:12.200]  I mentioned before talking to Alex
[03:40:12.200 --> 03:40:16.200]  about what's going on in Saudi Arabia
[03:40:16.200 --> 03:40:21.200]  how they invaded the sovereign nation of Yemen
[03:40:21.200 --> 03:40:23.200]  who did nothing to them.
[03:40:23.200 --> 03:40:27.200]  They want to put back the other dictator that was there.
[03:40:27.200 --> 03:40:30.200]  Before the other dictator, before him,
[03:40:30.200 --> 03:40:33.200]  Salah was thrown out and then Hadi was the next guy.
[03:40:33.200 --> 03:40:35.200]  They didn't even have a vote.
[03:40:35.200 --> 03:40:37.200]  The United States and Saudi Arabia put him in there.
[03:40:37.200 --> 03:40:39.200]  The Houthis didn't want him there.
[03:40:39.200 --> 03:40:41.200]  And the Houthis, by the way,
[03:40:41.200 --> 03:40:44.200]  had been only in Iran, excuse me, in Yemen
[03:40:44.200 --> 03:40:46.200]  for about a thousand years.
[03:40:46.200 --> 03:40:48.200]  They broke up the joint in the 1990s.
[03:40:48.200 --> 03:40:50.200]  There used to be two countries.
[03:40:50.200 --> 03:40:53.200]  And the Houthis are from the one section
[03:40:53.200 --> 03:40:56.200]  and the others are from a split country
[03:40:56.200 --> 03:40:58.200]  that they unified. It didn't work.
[03:40:58.200 --> 03:41:04.200]  So now we have Saudi Arabia destroying this country.
[03:41:04.200 --> 03:41:09.200]  Porous nation in the Middle East.
[03:41:09.200 --> 03:41:11.200]  The World Health Organization calls it
[03:41:11.200 --> 03:41:14.200]  the greatest health crisis in the world.
[03:41:14.200 --> 03:41:20.200]  The United Arab Emirates.
[03:41:20.200 --> 03:41:24.200]  Saudi forces arrive on Sokortva
[03:41:24.200 --> 03:41:29.200]  as Yemen slams United Arab Emirates
[03:41:29.200 --> 03:41:33.200]  colonization of Ireland.
[03:41:33.200 --> 03:41:35.200]  Saudi Arabia has announced Sunday
[03:41:35.200 --> 03:41:38.200]  that they are deploying troops to the Yemeni island.
[03:41:38.200 --> 03:41:43.200]  Now remember,
[03:41:43.200 --> 03:41:45.200]  there was this coalition
[03:41:45.200 --> 03:41:49.200]  that always going to overthrow the Yemen government
[03:41:49.200 --> 03:41:50.200]  of the Houthis,
[03:41:50.200 --> 03:41:53.200]  or the Houthis trying to overthrow the other government.
[03:41:53.200 --> 03:41:56.200]  But anyway, who could figure it out?
[03:41:56.200 --> 03:41:59.200]  And were they involved in this?
[03:41:59.200 --> 03:42:01.200]  And now they're reporting
[03:42:01.200 --> 03:42:06.200]  that United States troops are in Yemen as well
[03:42:06.200 --> 03:42:09.200]  after they were pushed out
[03:42:09.200 --> 03:42:13.200]  around 2013, 2014.
[03:42:13.200 --> 03:42:15.200]  So again, none of these wars,
[03:42:15.200 --> 03:42:18.200]  there's no victories to show for them.
[03:42:18.200 --> 03:42:21.200]  Only horror.
[03:42:21.200 --> 03:42:24.200]  And it's becoming more horrible.
[03:42:24.200 --> 03:42:27.200]  And that's why we're suggesting
[03:42:27.200 --> 03:42:31.200]  consider doing what you wish
[03:42:31.200 --> 03:42:34.200]  but be prepared.
[03:42:34.200 --> 03:42:39.200]  We'll be back in a minute.
[03:42:53.200 --> 03:42:55.200]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:42:55.200 --> 03:42:56.200]  Go ahead.
[03:42:56.200 --> 03:42:58.200]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[03:42:58.200 --> 03:43:00.200]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast,
[03:43:00.200 --> 03:43:01.200]  you're bragging.
[03:43:01.200 --> 03:43:03.200]  It just gets old, man.
[03:43:03.200 --> 03:43:05.200]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[03:43:05.200 --> 03:43:07.200]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:43:07.200 --> 03:43:10.200]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings
[03:43:10.200 --> 03:43:12.200]  trying to shut us down?
[03:43:12.200 --> 03:43:14.200]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:43:14.200 --> 03:43:16.200]  If that was happening to anybody else,
[03:43:16.200 --> 03:43:17.200]  I'd be freaked out.
[03:43:17.200 --> 03:43:19.200]  I mean, what's it going to take?
[03:43:19.200 --> 03:43:20.200]  Us being shut down?
[03:43:20.200 --> 03:43:21.200]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:43:21.200 --> 03:43:22.200]  You know what?
[03:43:22.200 --> 03:43:24.200]  I'll put it on pause again.
[03:43:24.200 --> 03:43:26.200]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging
[03:43:26.200 --> 03:43:28.200]  to say we are the tip of the spear,
[03:43:28.200 --> 03:43:30.200]  we're under attack, we need your help.
[03:43:30.200 --> 03:43:32.200]  As much begging as I do,
[03:43:32.200 --> 03:43:35.200]  we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:43:35.200 --> 03:43:36.200]  I'm not going to just stop growth
[03:43:36.200 --> 03:43:38.200]  and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:43:38.200 --> 03:43:39.200]  Do you understand?
[03:43:39.200 --> 03:43:40.200]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:43:40.200 --> 03:43:42.200]  I need your help, Frank.

[03:45:55.200 --> 03:45:57.200]  have created a powerful formula
[03:45:57.200 --> 03:46:00.200]  for inflammatory support and joint support.
[03:46:00.200 --> 03:46:03.200]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[03:46:03.200 --> 03:46:05.200]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms
[03:46:05.200 --> 03:46:07.200]  of turmeric available.
[03:46:07.200 --> 03:46:09.200]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years
[03:46:09.200 --> 03:46:11.200]  and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[03:46:11.200 --> 03:46:13.200]  It is well known in traditional medicine
[03:46:13.200 --> 03:46:15.200]  for its soothing properties.

[03:46:33.200 --> 03:46:36.200]  over 95% of the active ingredients.

[03:47:14.200 --> 03:47:17.200]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[03:47:17.200 --> 03:47:19.200]  you are the resistance.
[03:47:19.200 --> 03:47:22.200]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:47:25.200 --> 03:47:28.200]  So again, tracking trends
[03:47:28.200 --> 03:47:31.200]  is an understanding of where we are,
[03:47:31.200 --> 03:47:34.200]  how we got here, and where we're going.
[03:47:34.200 --> 03:47:37.200]  And before I was talking about gas
[03:47:37.200 --> 03:47:40.200]  and what it's going to do to the economy,
[03:47:40.200 --> 03:47:44.200]  again, current events form future trends.
[03:47:44.200 --> 03:47:46.200]  It's today's Wall Street Journal.
[03:47:46.200 --> 03:47:49.200]  Morgan Stanley estimates
[03:47:49.200 --> 03:47:53.200]  that if gas averages $2.96 this year,
[03:47:53.200 --> 03:47:56.200]  it would take an annualized
[03:47:56.200 --> 03:48:02.200]  $38 billion from spending elsewhere.
[03:48:02.200 --> 03:48:05.200]  That means retail.
[03:48:05.200 --> 03:48:09.200]  So again, be prepared.
[03:48:09.200 --> 03:48:13.200]  But think for yourself and think about this.
[03:48:13.200 --> 03:48:17.200]  InfoWars is introducing
[03:48:17.200 --> 03:48:22.200]  DNA Force Plus for InfoWarsLife
[03:48:22.200 --> 03:48:27.200]  and 50% off the introductory price
[03:48:27.200 --> 03:48:31.200]  of $74.95.
[03:48:31.200 --> 03:48:33.200]  After months of waiting,
[03:48:33.200 --> 03:48:36.200]  InfoWars is finally
[03:48:36.200 --> 03:48:38.200]  transforming self-force
[03:48:38.200 --> 03:48:40.200]  into what it was meant to be,
[03:48:40.200 --> 03:48:44.200]  DNA Force Plus.
[03:48:44.200 --> 03:48:46.200]  Using the same great formula
[03:48:46.200 --> 03:48:50.200]  to build up one of the most popular products ever,
[03:48:50.200 --> 03:48:55.200]  DNA Force Plus is the perfect formula
[03:48:55.200 --> 03:48:59.200]  to help you support optimal energy
[03:48:59.200 --> 03:49:01.200]  while adapting your body
[03:49:01.200 --> 03:49:08.200]  to handle the derelict bombardment of toxins.
[03:49:08.200 --> 03:49:10.200]  All right?
[03:49:10.200 --> 03:49:14.200]  The daily bombardment of toxins.
[03:49:14.200 --> 03:49:16.200]  The ones you eat, the ones you breathe,
[03:49:16.200 --> 03:49:18.200]  the ones you drink,
[03:49:18.200 --> 03:49:20.200]  and also the ones you hear
[03:49:20.200 --> 03:49:22.200]  and the ones you see.
[03:49:22.200 --> 03:49:26.200]  Because I've been at this game a long time
[03:49:26.200 --> 03:49:28.200]  hanging around this planet
[03:49:28.200 --> 03:49:30.200]  and I've never seen a freak show
[03:49:30.200 --> 03:49:33.200]  like the one going on.
[03:49:33.200 --> 03:49:37.200]  And the media is a disgusting joke.
[03:49:37.200 --> 03:49:39.200]  How can anybody watch this stuff?
[03:49:39.200 --> 03:49:42.200]  And the reality is they're not.
[03:49:42.200 --> 03:49:47.200]  Again, you have a country of 320 million people.
[03:49:47.200 --> 03:49:48.200]  And what do you got?
[03:49:48.200 --> 03:49:49.200]  Morning Joe.
[03:49:49.200 --> 03:49:53.200]  I hear about this guy all the time.
[03:49:53.200 --> 03:49:57.200]  And that's Brzezinski.
[03:49:57.200 --> 03:49:58.200]  Another one.
[03:49:58.200 --> 03:49:59.200]  She'd be nowhere if her old man
[03:49:59.200 --> 03:50:01.200]  wasn't the murderer of Brzezinski.
[03:50:01.200 --> 03:50:03.200]  Forgot that guy, huh?
[03:50:03.200 --> 03:50:06.200]  Undercauta.
[03:50:06.200 --> 03:50:11.200]  Yeah, he makes Bolton look like their brothers.
[03:50:11.200 --> 03:50:15.200]  Boy, they got a million people listening.
[03:50:15.200 --> 03:50:19.200]  So toxins hit you in a lot of ways.
[03:50:19.200 --> 03:50:24.200]  And as I said, we're telling our subscribers,
[03:50:24.200 --> 03:50:28.200]  advising, I should say, to prepare.
[03:50:28.200 --> 03:50:30.200]  Don't wait until it happens.
[03:50:30.200 --> 03:50:32.200]  It's too late.
[03:50:32.200 --> 03:50:35.200]  And Info Wars offers a lot of products
[03:50:35.200 --> 03:50:38.200]  for your survival.
[03:50:38.200 --> 03:50:46.200]  And now, as before, it will be survival of the fittest.
[03:50:46.200 --> 03:50:51.200]  And on to some other news.
[03:50:51.200 --> 03:50:56.200]  One of my solutions for a better life
[03:50:56.200 --> 03:51:01.200]  is what I call blockchain democracy.
[03:51:01.200 --> 03:51:05.200]  When Alex was talking to Roger Stone before,
[03:51:05.200 --> 03:51:07.200]  he made a comment about, you know,
[03:51:07.200 --> 03:51:11.200]  what is Congress stupid or words to that effect?
[03:51:11.200 --> 03:51:12.200]  How come they don't do anything?
[03:51:12.200 --> 03:51:13.200]  How are they stupid?
[03:51:13.200 --> 03:51:16.200]  Of course, they're stupid.
[03:51:16.200 --> 03:51:19.200]  Why can't we call a spade a spade?
[03:51:19.200 --> 03:51:27.200]  Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham,
[03:51:27.200 --> 03:51:35.200]  Diane not so Feinstein, little Chuck E. Schumann,
[03:51:35.200 --> 03:51:40.200]  Nancy out of a mind Pelosi.
[03:51:40.200 --> 03:51:43.200]  Is Congress stupid?
[03:51:43.200 --> 03:51:46.200]  They're ignorant psychopaths and sociopaths.
[03:51:46.200 --> 03:51:49.200]  They don't represent me.
[03:51:49.200 --> 03:51:53.200]  Andrew Cuomo, the arrogant governor, doesn't represent me.
[03:51:53.200 --> 03:51:56.200]  The mayor of Kingston doesn't represent me.
[03:51:56.200 --> 03:51:58.200]  No one represents me.
[03:51:58.200 --> 03:52:01.200]  I represent myself.
[03:52:01.200 --> 03:52:03.200]  I live in the United States of America.
[03:52:03.200 --> 03:52:05.200]  We're bombing countries all the time
[03:52:05.200 --> 03:52:07.200]  to bring them freedom and democracy.
[03:52:07.200 --> 03:52:09.200]  Oh, I forgot about that story
[03:52:09.200 --> 03:52:12.200]  that's out of the news that happened Friday.
[03:52:12.200 --> 03:52:15.200]  We can go Friday.
[03:52:15.200 --> 03:52:20.200]  The NSA, what, 550 million taps
[03:52:20.200 --> 03:52:25.200]  in telephones and messaging systems?
[03:52:25.200 --> 03:52:27.200]  Who makes this stuff up?
[03:52:27.200 --> 03:52:29.200]  So here's the trend.
[03:52:29.200 --> 03:52:32.200]  Blockchain democracy.
[03:52:32.200 --> 03:52:33.200]  Two stories.
[03:52:33.200 --> 03:52:35.200]  Again, current events form future trends
[03:52:35.200 --> 03:52:37.200]  to put this into perspective.
[03:52:37.200 --> 03:52:40.200]  When you make that transaction, it's blocked.
[03:52:40.200 --> 03:52:43.200]  Blockchain.
[03:52:43.200 --> 03:52:49.200]  Here's how blockchain may replace IDs in the future.
[03:52:49.200 --> 03:52:51.200]  So looking at over 1 billion people worldwide
[03:52:51.200 --> 03:52:53.200]  don't have any form of identification,
[03:52:53.200 --> 03:52:57.200]  making it difficult to access many of the social institutions
[03:52:57.200 --> 03:53:00.200]  the developed world takes for granted.
[03:53:00.200 --> 03:53:04.200]  So they're looking to make blockchain
[03:53:04.200 --> 03:53:08.200]  the underpinnings of digital identity.
[03:53:08.200 --> 03:53:12.200]  And this is going to the World Food Program.
[03:53:12.200 --> 03:53:19.200]  Two, HSBC trade finance transaction
[03:53:19.200 --> 03:53:25.200]  opens door for blockchain in $9 trillion market.
[03:53:25.200 --> 03:53:28.200]  Again, current events form future trends.
[03:53:28.200 --> 03:53:31.200]  This is today's.
[03:53:31.200 --> 03:53:34.200]  By the way, see the way I underline these stories.
[03:53:34.200 --> 03:53:37.200]  I underline the salient points of the story.
[03:53:37.200 --> 03:53:40.200]  So it helps me remember them.
[03:53:40.200 --> 03:53:44.200]  I'm bringing this back to blockchain democracy.
[03:53:44.200 --> 03:53:47.200]  What are we going to the polls for?
[03:53:47.200 --> 03:53:52.200]  You could bank online, you could vote online.
[03:53:52.200 --> 03:53:55.200]  You got a tax plan?
[03:53:55.200 --> 03:53:57.200]  We'll vote on it.
[03:53:57.200 --> 03:53:59.200]  You want to go to war?
[03:53:59.200 --> 03:54:01.200]  We'll vote on it.
[03:54:01.200 --> 03:54:04.200]  Oh, the people are too stupid.
[03:54:04.200 --> 03:54:05.200]  Yeah?
[03:54:05.200 --> 03:54:08.200]  Dumber than Schumer?
[03:54:08.200 --> 03:54:12.200]  More moronic than Graham?
[03:54:12.200 --> 03:54:16.200]  Out of a mind more than Pelosi?
[03:54:16.200 --> 03:54:19.200]  Let us determine our future.
[03:54:19.200 --> 03:54:22.200]  Hey, you see they're legalizing gambling now?
[03:54:22.200 --> 03:54:25.200]  Supreme Court said so.
[03:54:25.200 --> 03:54:28.200]  Oh, yeah, like marijuana, right?
[03:54:28.200 --> 03:54:30.200]  Throw you in jail, bust you for that.
[03:54:30.200 --> 03:54:32.200]  But people dying on opiates.
[03:54:32.200 --> 03:54:34.200]  They come from the drug companies.
[03:54:34.200 --> 03:54:36.200]  Let the people vote.
[03:54:36.200 --> 03:54:38.200]  The richest country in the world
[03:54:38.200 --> 03:54:43.200]  where every guy got a gun.
[03:54:43.200 --> 03:54:48.200]  And they're not blowing people's brains out as Switzerland.
[03:54:48.200 --> 03:54:55.200]  More dough, more guns than anybody per capita.
[03:54:55.200 --> 03:54:58.200]  They vote on major issues.
[03:54:58.200 --> 03:55:03.200]  You don't know who the president of Switzerland is.
[03:55:03.200 --> 03:55:05.200]  Let the people vote.
[03:55:05.200 --> 03:55:08.200]  Let us decide.
[03:55:08.200 --> 03:55:12.200]  And you don't have to wait online in these stupid polling places
[03:55:12.200 --> 03:55:15.200]  with a bunch of stupid, arrogant people
[03:55:15.200 --> 03:55:18.200]  where I'm important this day.
[03:55:18.200 --> 03:55:20.200]  Man, blockchain.
[03:55:20.200 --> 03:55:22.200]  It's blocked.
[03:55:22.200 --> 03:55:26.200]  And the system to be entirely open for review.
[03:55:26.200 --> 03:55:30.200]  So you know it's not being had.
[03:55:30.200 --> 03:55:34.200]  Blockchain democracy is my future.
[03:55:34.200 --> 03:55:37.200]  And you know my motto is think for yourself.
[03:55:37.200 --> 03:55:41.200]  People running the show don't represent me.
[03:55:41.200 --> 03:55:47.200]  They represent what adults call bribes and payoffs.
[03:55:47.200 --> 03:55:51.200]  And the prostitute media calls campaign contributions.
[03:55:51.200 --> 03:55:54.200]  Those are the people they represent.
[03:55:54.200 --> 03:55:57.200]  Blockchain democracy.
[03:55:57.200 --> 03:56:00.200]  It's the real deal.
[03:56:00.200 --> 03:56:03.200]  Good or bad will decide.
[03:56:03.200 --> 03:56:06.200]  I was not put on this earth
[03:56:06.200 --> 03:56:11.200]  to take someone who does something by definition
[03:56:11.200 --> 03:56:15.200]  a politician in a manipulative and devious way
[03:56:15.200 --> 03:56:20.200]  to gain advancement within an organization to represent me.
[03:56:20.200 --> 03:56:25.200]  I don't know about you, but that's the way I feel about it.
[03:56:25.200 --> 03:56:29.200]  So, in wrapping up, remember,
[03:56:29.200 --> 03:56:32.200]  we're looking for a lot of problems over there.
[03:56:32.200 --> 03:56:36.200]  But you know what China is doing? You're taking advantage of it.
[03:56:36.200 --> 03:56:42.200]  The business of China is to exploit business at any level in any way possible.
[03:56:42.200 --> 03:56:45.200]  You got it right here.
[03:56:45.200 --> 03:56:51.200]  China poised to cash in on Europe's lost business.
[03:56:51.200 --> 03:56:55.200]  And entrepreneurs' paradise,
[03:56:55.200 --> 03:57:01.200]  over 21 million new companies registered in China over four years.
[03:57:01.200 --> 03:57:04.200]  So, the business of China, like them or not,
[03:57:04.200 --> 03:57:07.200]  is business in any way they do it.
[03:57:07.200 --> 03:57:11.200]  The business of America has become war.
[03:57:11.200 --> 03:57:14.200]  It's about guns and butter.
[03:57:14.200 --> 03:57:18.200]  So, again, what your money, where your mind is,
[03:57:18.200 --> 03:57:22.200]  support Infowars, and we'll see you soon.
[03:57:22.200 --> 03:57:32.200]  Thanks for tuning in.
[03:57:52.200 --> 03:57:56.200]  It's not a law that if you criticize Islam or gays,
[03:57:56.200 --> 03:57:58.200]  you'll get six months in prison.
[03:57:58.200 --> 03:58:02.200]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the U.K.
[03:58:02.200 --> 03:58:07.200]  CNN and many others are calling for Infowars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[03:58:07.200 --> 03:58:10.200]  Slate magazine has a professor and others saying,
[03:58:10.200 --> 03:58:14.200]  go beyond censorship, brainwash young people against Infowars.
[03:58:14.200 --> 03:58:19.200]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[03:58:19.200 --> 03:58:22.200]  Infowars are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[03:58:22.200 --> 03:58:25.200]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com,
[03:58:25.200 --> 03:58:28.200]  or slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter
[03:58:28.200 --> 03:58:32.200]  so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can bully their way in
[03:58:32.200 --> 03:58:37.200]  and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue as a society.
[03:58:37.200 --> 03:58:39.200]  That is critical to this fight.
[03:58:39.200 --> 03:58:44.200]  We will prevail if you take action, and I know you will.
[03:58:44.200 --> 03:58:47.200]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products,
[03:58:47.200 --> 03:58:49.200]  we have an Infowars life.
[03:58:49.200 --> 03:58:51.200]  It takes hours.
[03:58:51.200 --> 03:58:53.200]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[03:58:53.200 --> 03:58:56.200]  It's stronger. It's the other equation in probiotics.
[03:58:56.200 --> 03:58:59.200]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[03:58:59.200 --> 03:59:00.200]  It's back in stock.
[03:59:00.200 --> 03:59:03.200]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
