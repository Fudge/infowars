[00:00.000 --> 00:08.600]  It's May day, the deep state's been publicly exposed to shadow government, thanks to valiant
[00:08.600 --> 00:12.640]  patriots in and outside of the government, but ABC News claims the deep state doesn't
[00:12.640 --> 00:13.640]  exist.
[00:13.640 --> 00:16.640]  Isn't that just amazing?
[00:16.640 --> 00:22.560]  ABC News recently broadcasts pure propaganda to all of its supposed cheap viewers about
[00:22.560 --> 00:27.160]  the recent mass use of the mysterious term deep state.
[00:27.160 --> 00:32.760]  The deep state is the notion that there is a network of career government employees
[00:32.760 --> 00:36.320]  who are secretly manipulating government policy.
[00:36.320 --> 00:42.440]  They could have positions in the military, intelligence agencies or other areas of government.
[00:42.440 --> 00:48.720]  Supporters of President Donald Trump point to leaks from career bureaucrats who they
[00:48.720 --> 00:52.440]  say are undermining his agenda.
[00:52.440 --> 00:59.240]  Many write the deep state off as a conspiracy theory because no evidence of an organized
[00:59.240 --> 01:00.920]  effort has surfaced.
[01:00.920 --> 01:06.720]  The phrase was originally used to refer to power dynamics in foreign countries like
[01:06.720 --> 01:08.880]  the former Soviet Union.
[01:08.880 --> 01:15.720]  The term began gaining traction during the 2016 presidential race and became prominent
[01:15.720 --> 01:17.760]  after Trump's election.
[01:17.760 --> 01:23.120]  Perhaps ABC News, if it wasn't a CIA operation itself, should have dug a little further into
[01:23.120 --> 01:24.200]  their archives.
[01:24.200 --> 01:27.640]  The evolution of the deep state reads like a U.S. history book.
[01:27.640 --> 01:33.280]  In 1947, Harry S. Truman created the CIA by signing the National Security Act.
[01:33.280 --> 01:38.800]  Founding members of the CIA included Skull and Bones member Prescott Bush and the dynamic
[01:38.800 --> 01:41.920]  duo Allen Dulles and John Foster Dulles.
[01:41.920 --> 01:48.080]  Hastily, the Office of Policy Coordination was formed in 1948, Radio Free Europe in
[01:48.080 --> 01:55.600]  1949, Operation Mockingbird in the 1950s where at least 25 media organizations and 400 journalists
[01:55.600 --> 01:58.240]  immediately became CIA assets.
[01:58.240 --> 02:07.400]  MKUltra, Mind Control Operations began around 1953, the 1961 deep state coup of our executive
[02:07.400 --> 02:13.400]  branch as Allen Dulles led the Operation Mongoose Fiasco resulting in the Bay of Pigs that nearly
[02:13.400 --> 02:15.360]  annihilated the United States.
[02:15.360 --> 02:20.400]  The JFK assassination, which we will know more about the deep state's actual involvement
[02:20.400 --> 02:26.800]  as the 25th anniversary allows secret documents to be released in October of this year.
[02:26.800 --> 02:32.520]  The false Gulf of Tonkin narrative, the murder of over 20,000 Vietnamese civilians in Operation
[02:32.520 --> 02:38.360]  Phoenix, Operation Chaos which tracked thousands of protesters and organizations, the Iran
[02:38.360 --> 02:44.640]  Contra Fair, the weapons of mass destruction lies to get us into the Iraq war and the deconstruction
[02:44.640 --> 02:47.920]  of the Middle East and that is merely scratching the surface.
[02:47.920 --> 02:51.720]  It would be easier if it were a conspiracy.
[02:51.720 --> 02:54.000]  You're describing but that's not the case, is it?
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.080]  This is something that hides in plain sight.
[02:57.080 --> 03:04.360]  It's kind of a natural evolution when so much money and political control is at stake
[03:04.360 --> 03:07.480]  in the most powerful country in the world.
[03:07.480 --> 03:09.800]  This has evolved over time.
[03:09.800 --> 03:13.320]  It's all the national security functions of the government.
[03:13.320 --> 03:19.920]  It's the Pentagon, it's homeland security, it's the state department, it's also treasury
[03:19.920 --> 03:24.840]  because they have a kind of symbiotic relationship with Wall Street.
[03:24.840 --> 03:30.520]  And here we are in 2017 as the deep state draws China and Russia into a great war over
[03:30.520 --> 03:32.360]  Syria and North Korea.
[03:32.360 --> 03:37.720]  Meanwhile, the continuity of government plan ensures that the deep state will keep rolling
[03:37.720 --> 03:42.920]  on as US citizens are decimated due to one catastrophe or another.
[03:42.920 --> 03:49.160]  So you see, the deep state actually isn't a hidden organization or a conspiracy theory.
[03:49.160 --> 03:55.480]  It is a taxpayer-funded factory of death and subversion, producing the elite initiatives
[03:55.480 --> 04:01.040]  of the Banker Wall Street class carried out by a group of well-known federal organizations
[04:01.040 --> 04:08.080]  that have officially molded US history for the past 70 years by acting further and further
[04:08.080 --> 04:11.760]  outside of the US Constitution as time goes by.
[04:11.760 --> 04:18.080]  And the Councils of Government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence
[04:18.080 --> 04:22.840]  whether sought or unsought by the military-industrial complex.
[04:22.840 --> 04:28.120]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.
[04:28.120 --> 04:34.800]  And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized
[04:34.800 --> 04:40.680]  upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship
[04:40.680 --> 04:42.000]  and concealment.
[04:42.000 --> 04:58.640]  So who is pushing the conspiracy theory now?
[04:58.640 --> 05:03.840]  Although conservative commentator Ann Coulter backed out of showing up to her already-canceled
[05:03.840 --> 05:09.800]  speech at Berkeley, that didn't stop freedom-loving Americans from conducting a large First Amendment
[05:09.800 --> 05:12.080]  rally in its place.
[05:12.080 --> 05:17.320]  Prominent social media icons such as Gavin McInnis, Lauren Southern, Baced Stickman,
[05:17.320 --> 05:22.560]  Baked Alaska, Brittany Pettibone, and Faith Goldie showed up to support free speech and
[05:22.560 --> 05:24.320]  gave speeches.
[05:24.320 --> 05:28.680]  Reports that the Berkeley police did their job in protecting the peace have come in,
[05:28.680 --> 05:34.800]  and apparently a total of six Antifa protesters were arrested, two for resisting arrest, one
[05:34.800 --> 05:38.960]  for a drug violation, and another for possessing a weapon.
[05:38.960 --> 05:44.120]  Few more arrests were made earlier in the day for possession of a knife and obstructing
[05:44.120 --> 05:47.560]  an officer and wearing a mask to evade police.
[05:47.560 --> 05:52.400]  Despite these arrests, the protests remained peaceful, and dialogue between both sides
[05:52.400 --> 05:53.640]  was present.
[05:53.640 --> 06:23.480]  This is Milly Weaver reporting to you for infowars.com.

[07:01.520 --> 07:03.480]  We've been sold out for months.

[07:08.600 --> 07:12.200]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its
[07:12.200 --> 07:13.200]  core.

[07:17.240 --> 07:22.360]  and Biotrucelinium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[07:22.360 --> 07:25.680]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[07:25.680 --> 07:30.880]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight, Biotrucelinium
[07:30.880 --> 07:35.600]  is also the perfect supercharger to survive the shield X2 nascent iodine, as both help
[07:35.600 --> 07:37.840]  support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.

[07:52.080 --> 07:54.200]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[07:54.200 --> 07:55.720]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[07:55.720 --> 08:13.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[08:13.000 --> 08:22.120]  front lines of the Info War.
[08:22.120 --> 08:32.320]  This morning I was talking to one of my friends, and he said to me, he said, Alex, man, InfoWars
[08:32.320 --> 08:38.720]  is going to be shut down soon, while your traffic's down 85%, and you don't have any
[08:38.720 --> 08:42.080]  audience, everybody's turning against you.
[08:42.080 --> 08:44.920]  And I asked him, I said, where'd you get that information?
[08:44.920 --> 08:49.520]  He said, oh, I saw it on infowars.com being spammed in the comments.
[08:49.520 --> 08:53.880]  And I looked at my friend who I've known for more than a decade, and I said, well, you
[08:53.880 --> 08:57.520]  know that's part of a PR campaign of disinformation, right?
[08:57.520 --> 09:00.400]  He looked at me and he said, is it really?
[09:00.400 --> 09:06.440]  I mean, they attack you every day on every major news channel, almost every night on
[09:06.440 --> 09:14.360]  the late night shows, from Jimmy Kimmel to Stephen Colbert, you're on CNN or MSNBC every
[09:14.360 --> 09:20.280]  night saying you're fake news, saying you're a liar, saying you're an actor, saying you're
[09:20.280 --> 09:24.920]  a fraud, how could you survive that?
[09:24.920 --> 09:30.800]  And I looked at him and I said, we're bigger than we've ever been.
[09:30.800 --> 09:40.640]  We have more traffic, more people, more affiliates, more listeners, and more revenue than InfoWars
[09:40.640 --> 09:47.040]  has ever had in 22 years.
[09:47.040 --> 09:56.960]  And my friend looked at me like I was a liar and said, we'll see.
[09:56.960 --> 10:04.600]  And if you can understand that statement, you can understand everything in this world
[10:04.600 --> 10:05.600]  today.
[10:05.600 --> 10:11.040]  There are people that believe mainstream media and believe the hype, and there are people
[10:11.040 --> 10:13.760]  that don't.
[10:13.760 --> 10:20.840]  But if mainstream media can get enough people to believe something and get enough people
[10:20.840 --> 10:23.640]  to buy into it, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[10:23.640 --> 10:30.520]  I got a call from a New York Times writer, a very prominent writer last night, wanted
[10:30.520 --> 10:37.200]  to talk to me, and I've known him for about 16, 17 years, so I called him back.
[10:37.200 --> 10:40.280]  And they said, listen, I don't agree with your politics, but it's clear that Shabani
[10:40.280 --> 10:50.880]  yogurt lawsuit and the Democrats trying to get the pizza place to sue you there in D.C.
[10:50.880 --> 10:55.960]  and the media saying you're fake news and the one-sided coverage on your custody battle
[10:55.960 --> 11:02.080]  for your children and all the major news channels attacking you, that they're trying to shut
[11:02.080 --> 11:03.880]  you down.
[11:03.880 --> 11:07.320]  And I said, do you think I need to be shut down?
[11:07.320 --> 11:13.880]  And they said, no, if you stop bashing the Muslims, who are nice, peaceful people, you
[11:13.880 --> 11:15.320]  don't need to be shut down.
[11:15.320 --> 11:19.880]  And I said, oh, is that a message?
[11:19.880 --> 11:23.320]  And the person was silent.
[11:23.320 --> 11:29.160]  So here's what's happening, 99% of people are followers.
[11:29.160 --> 11:35.800]  Most people act like they're leaders, but a leader does what's right regardless of what
[11:35.800 --> 11:40.920]  happens to them individually for the greater good of the species.
[11:40.920 --> 11:50.000]  Now, don't get confused by that and think that means we're collectivists and just give
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.640]  ourselves over to some slave master that directs us around for the greater good.
[11:55.640 --> 12:01.800]  We're not a beehive or an ant hill, an ant colony.
[12:01.800 --> 12:08.240]  But what I'm going through is no longer a microcosm, but it is on a smaller scale to
[12:08.240 --> 12:10.920]  what's happening to President Trump.
[12:10.920 --> 12:20.040]  And it's a beta test, I've been picked for the test, the test pilot of the globalist.
[12:20.040 --> 12:25.120]  I don't work for them, don't like them, but they've chosen me as the test pilot.
[12:25.120 --> 12:30.480]  I'm like the chimp, they fire up into space to see what happens to me, to test the news
[12:30.480 --> 12:37.920]  wars, the Pentagon, the CIA, the broadcast board of governors of the FCC having congressional
[12:37.920 --> 12:45.560]  meetings and saying we're gearing up to take out Alex Jones and other fake news and we
[12:45.560 --> 12:48.800]  say we can do that because they work for the Russians.
[12:48.800 --> 12:54.400]  So I've now been dehumanized and I'm a foreign spy, see, with no evidence, no jury, never
[12:54.400 --> 12:58.560]  get to face my accuser, never get to respond on the news, don't get to go before the Congress
[12:58.560 --> 12:59.920]  at a hearing.
[12:59.920 --> 13:08.440]  They were calling real reds in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee, some
[13:08.440 --> 13:12.920]  were innocent, some weren't, but at least they got to face their accuser, not in the
[13:12.920 --> 13:16.920]  1984 scenario of 2017.
[13:16.920 --> 13:23.080]  So I'm a Russian spy, they say, I'm a racist, I'm a homophobe, I'm just, you name it, I
[13:23.080 --> 13:28.640]  hate women, you don't see any proof of that, but they don't care, that's what they say.
[13:28.640 --> 13:37.720]  And that's the accepted, kosher, politically correct thing to do, whether it's in a civil
[13:37.720 --> 13:45.280]  trial for your children or whether it's on the news is you sit there and you can't talk
[13:45.280 --> 13:52.000]  and the mainstream media, the Rachel Maddow's, the co-bears, the lawyers, whoever it is they
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.240]  point at you and they say that's a person who doesn't think women should be able to
[13:57.240 --> 13:58.400]  be judges.
[13:58.400 --> 14:04.040]  That's a person that's racist, that's a person that's in the KKK, that's a person that's
[14:04.040 --> 14:09.520]  a cult leader and brainwashes children, that's a person that's an actor and isn't real, that's
[14:09.520 --> 14:17.280]  a person that's bad and they all point at you and they feel strong in the big collective
[14:17.280 --> 14:20.040]  of the corporate system going along with that narrative.
[14:20.040 --> 14:25.760]  It's very inviting, it's very sexy, it's very alluring to imagine you're powerful through
[14:25.760 --> 14:27.720]  the power structure.
[14:27.720 --> 14:35.320]  To imagine you're powerful because it's happening, the followers are scared, they can feel the
[14:35.320 --> 14:41.080]  energy rising, they can see the political change, the economy shutting down, Trump's
[14:41.080 --> 14:45.400]  trying to fix that, say what you want about Trump, he's trying to do that, he's trying
[14:45.400 --> 14:50.400]  to be president and so they're there beta testing, they're false reality acting like
[14:50.400 --> 14:56.440]  it's the end of the world that Alex Jones exists, it's the end of the world that Donald
[14:56.440 --> 15:02.560]  Trump exists, it's the end of the world that someone's speaking out against globalism and
[15:02.560 --> 15:03.640]  why?
[15:03.640 --> 15:07.280]  Because we're right about GMO, we're right about fluoride, we're right about the vaccines,
[15:07.280 --> 15:10.680]  we're right about unelected world government, we're right about the elites working with
[15:10.680 --> 15:15.520]  radical Islam and trying to open the borders up to it and protecting it and letting them
[15:15.520 --> 15:20.360]  attack and they're not even calling it terror and we're right about globalism being designed
[15:20.360 --> 15:27.840]  to impoverish people and so folks are scared, even Donald Trump's family, Ivanka and Jared
[15:27.840 --> 15:34.800]  Kushner aren't bad people but they're weak minded, they live on Fifth Avenue, they hang
[15:34.800 --> 15:38.720]  around with the richest, disconnected people in the world, they're not blue collar rich
[15:38.720 --> 15:46.600]  like their dad, like the father-in-law for Kushner and they go out to dinner with the
[15:46.600 --> 15:50.360]  Schmitz of the world, they go out to dinner with the Clintons of the world, they go out
[15:50.360 --> 15:56.440]  to dinner with the Soros of the world and they have this elitist attitude towards everybody
[15:56.440 --> 16:01.800]  else and they get scared when their elitist friends start putting pressure on them and
[16:01.800 --> 16:06.480]  telling them your dad's going to fail if you don't get him back on track or Alex Jones
[16:06.480 --> 16:11.160]  is going to fail, Alex Jones is going down, Alex Jones is in trouble, Alex Jones is under
[16:11.160 --> 16:17.160]  attack, Alex Jones has got everybody coming after him second only to Donald Trump and
[16:17.160 --> 16:21.400]  people say oh my gosh, how are you handling it when they walk over on the street and shake
[16:21.400 --> 16:27.760]  my hand, I really appreciate you what you've done for everybody and I'm like done for everybody,
[16:27.760 --> 16:33.040]  I'm so glad they're attacking me everywhere, I'm so glad they're lying about me everywhere,
[16:33.040 --> 16:38.960]  I'm so glad they're moving heaven and earth to politically assassinate my character because
[16:38.960 --> 16:44.920]  that means I've dealt them grievous blows, that means I really counted in this life,
[16:44.920 --> 16:49.920]  that meant I was on the field and took it to the enemy, I wasn't the third measure or
[16:49.920 --> 16:55.800]  the tenth of a measure of a man, I measured up to my ancestors, I did what it took, I
[16:55.800 --> 17:01.400]  didn't back down victory or death like Colonel Travis at the Alamo and I'll say that now,
[17:01.400 --> 17:08.160]  victory or death, I'm the opposite of scared now, I am totally invigorated, empowered and
[17:08.160 --> 17:13.160]  quite frankly can't handle the discernment I have, that's why I've tended to pour alcohol
[17:13.160 --> 17:20.760]  on top of it because I can't even handle being this alive but I'm done with that.
[17:20.760 --> 17:27.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we stand at the threshold of a totally new era of renaissance, it's
[17:27.040 --> 17:32.760]  our choice, we're given free will, trust in God but type your camel, something good the
[17:32.760 --> 17:41.960]  better one said, got kind of changed a little bit by another great writer who of course
[17:41.960 --> 17:47.880]  is the book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas that he wrote where he said pray to God but
[17:47.880 --> 17:53.520]  row away from the rocks, honoris Thompson, pray to God but row away from the rocks, we're
[17:53.520 --> 17:59.120]  already seeing cancer up thousands of percentile depending on the type 10,000% more in children,
[17:59.120 --> 18:04.000]  we're already seeing cross species pollinization, we're already seeing mutations accelerate
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.680]  exponentially, we're already seeing allergies exponentially, we're seeing neurological disorders
[18:08.680 --> 18:13.200]  off the charts, we're seeing brain aneurysms off the charts, we're seeing deformities off
[18:13.200 --> 18:22.200]  the charts in children, we're seeing the plagues of the new world order and I realized like
[18:22.200 --> 18:27.480]  we're in a Houdini chamber and the water is pouring in and if we don't get out of these
[18:27.480 --> 18:31.720]  chains folks, we're going to drown, I'm fighting as hard as I can to get the chains off me
[18:31.720 --> 18:36.160]  and you because we're collectively bound together and you're saying you're sitting there while
[18:36.160 --> 18:41.480]  I'm trying to get the chains off of us going wow you really have courage, thank you, courage,
[18:41.480 --> 18:48.720]  courage is to sit here and drown, this is called life force, it's called will, it's called
[18:48.720 --> 18:58.200]  the will to not be killed, it's the will to survive but it's all just the PR hype of
[18:58.200 --> 19:03.600]  the empty globalist system attacking Trump, attacking me, you name it and has Trump gone
[19:03.600 --> 19:04.600]  sideways some?
[19:04.600 --> 19:08.360]  Absolutely, I'm surprised he got this much done but he's returning jobs, he's promoting
[19:08.360 --> 19:13.520]  the family, he's promoting people, he's trying to stop radical Islam, he is moving the power
[19:13.520 --> 19:18.080]  away from the global elites back to America and back to the states and back to our industry,
[19:18.080 --> 19:21.640]  he's doing a great job and that's why even though on the surface he looks like he's
[19:21.640 --> 19:25.920]  given in some, they're only tripling down their attacks because they know he's real
[19:25.920 --> 19:30.160]  and they know the course he's on, that's why they say he's not real, it's why they
[19:30.160 --> 19:36.520]  say I'm not real constantly, I've got it easier than Trump, I'm just a broadcast, an investigative
[19:36.520 --> 19:40.960]  system, I can be totally pure, Trump has to work with all these groups to compromise to
[19:40.960 --> 19:45.000]  get things done or they'll shut the government down and say he did it but overall he's doing
[19:45.000 --> 19:51.120]  a fabulous job, Trump's not falling, Trump's rising, I'm not falling, I'm rising, they
[19:51.120 --> 19:56.640]  may end up defeating me but I win in the animating contest, you understand, but right now we
[19:56.640 --> 19:58.200]  are kicking butt.

[23:26.440 --> 23:30.760]  It's called the Deep State, Barack Obama's most loyal aides still hold office and they
[23:30.760 --> 23:32.600]  want to stop President Trump.
[23:32.600 --> 23:36.520]  Deep State was first revealed in the runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.
[23:36.520 --> 23:42.120]  David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government in exile and his shocking plan.

[24:09.760 --> 24:13.400]  Alright, Trump just gave a speech about massive tax cuts he's going to push, that's coming
[24:13.400 --> 24:14.400]  up in the next segment.
[24:14.400 --> 24:18.040]  I'm going to open the phones up, I've got huge North Korean news, economy news, so much
[24:18.040 --> 24:22.560]  positive news that we're going to be getting to as well.
[24:22.560 --> 24:27.360]  And then we've got more hoaxes in the media against Info Wars.
[24:27.360 --> 24:31.680]  But before I go any further, let me just go back to what I was talking about.
[24:31.680 --> 24:39.240]  There's this hoax going on that Trump's going to fall, that Info Wars is going to fall.
[24:39.240 --> 24:43.960]  But when Trump gets attacked, people just supporting more, the same thing for Info Wars.
[24:43.960 --> 24:50.800]  So we are literally getting bigger, getting more successful, reaching more people.
[24:50.800 --> 24:55.000]  What do you think happens when every major news channel and every major newspaper attacks
[24:55.000 --> 24:56.480]  you and lies about you?
[24:56.480 --> 25:00.320]  This hit in 20 years ago, 30 years ago, when it would destroy you.
[25:00.320 --> 25:06.960]  MSM is so discredited that it sends new people to you that never heard about you before and
[25:06.960 --> 25:09.480]  our audience is exploding.
[25:09.480 --> 25:14.160]  We have the biggest audience I've ever had in 22 years, except for election week.
[25:14.160 --> 25:16.000]  Let me give people basically a graph.
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.400]  I'm just going to this week do a report on this to show everybody, to show you what
[25:19.400 --> 25:24.760]  a hoax it is that Info Wars is imploding.
[25:24.760 --> 25:29.920]  I can show you Google Analytics over the years, and it basically goes something like this.
[25:29.920 --> 25:35.800]  It starts back with the website in 1997, got on there in 1995, and it's like this.
[25:35.800 --> 25:41.480]  Just over the years, it goes like this, and then with the election, it goes like this,
[25:41.480 --> 25:47.600]  and now it's kind of gone down a tiny bit, but then still going up.
[25:47.600 --> 25:52.320]  That's why Info Wars is under attack, because we're going straight up.
[25:52.320 --> 25:57.320]  In fact, it's more like traffic.
[25:57.320 --> 25:58.320]  It's more like that.
[25:58.320 --> 26:00.840]  I mean, that's what's happened since the election.
[26:00.840 --> 26:06.840]  We're just going straight up parabolic curve, and then now almost at that same level.
[26:06.840 --> 26:12.080]  So we went up to a new high, and we're at a new plateau.
[26:12.080 --> 26:17.280]  This is 80 plus million people.
[26:17.280 --> 26:19.560]  This is 60 plus million.
[26:19.560 --> 26:24.320]  Before the election, our high was 40-something million.
[26:24.320 --> 26:29.960]  And that's on our sites, our videos, our articles, listing to the show.
[26:29.960 --> 26:32.200]  It's not counting everybody duplicating our information.
[26:32.200 --> 26:33.320]  I'm not up here bragging.
[26:33.320 --> 26:42.160]  I just want you to understand, just like Tokyo Rose, when we were dropping Fat Man and Little
[26:42.160 --> 26:53.560]  Boy on Hiroshima and Nakasaki from bombers in World War II, Tokyo Rose was on AM radio
[26:53.560 --> 26:58.320]  and shortwave going, I'm sorry, GIs, that you're all defeated and your aircraft carriers
[26:58.320 --> 27:00.240]  are all on fire and sinking.
[27:00.240 --> 27:05.160]  Did you hear today that in the South China Sea, we destroyed one more of your battleships?
[27:05.160 --> 27:08.200]  Yes, it's too bad you're all dead.
[27:08.200 --> 27:13.560]  And by then, everybody knew it was bull.
[27:13.560 --> 27:16.960]  But years before, it would actually manipulate some people's minds.
[27:16.960 --> 27:22.440]  In fact, Tokyo Rose, there was a bunch of women that played her, but it was just Japanese
[27:22.440 --> 27:23.440]  women speaking in English.
[27:23.440 --> 27:26.480]  They even had one lady that was actually from, I think it was like Canada that worked for
[27:26.480 --> 27:30.760]  the Japanese, but they'd be saying, let me place a nice little classical music for you
[27:30.760 --> 27:33.080]  or maybe some big band music.
[27:33.080 --> 27:36.600]  Think of your sweetheart, you're never going to see her again, or your sweethearts with
[27:36.600 --> 27:39.840]  another man right now back in Kansas.
[27:39.840 --> 27:41.360]  You ought to hear those old tapes.
[27:41.360 --> 27:42.640]  There's a bunch of them online on YouTube.
[27:42.640 --> 27:46.640]  You can listen to hours of Tokyo Rose and it's so ridiculous.
[27:46.640 --> 27:53.320]  Just like Baghdad Bob in 2003, there's fighter bombers with explosions going off a mile behind
[27:53.320 --> 27:54.320]  him.
[27:54.320 --> 27:56.840]  He's like, we have defeated the Americans.
[27:56.840 --> 27:59.040]  We throw them back into Kuwait.
[27:59.040 --> 28:00.040]  They are defeated.
[28:00.040 --> 28:01.040]  They are gone.
[28:01.040 --> 28:02.040]  It is over.
[28:02.040 --> 28:03.040]  Yes, we annihilate them.
[28:03.040 --> 28:06.120]  And a bomb goes off behind him.
[28:06.120 --> 28:07.280]  Baghdad Bob.
[28:07.280 --> 28:13.160]  Now, we're not beating the globalist that bad, but I mean, it's getting close to that.
[28:13.160 --> 28:19.440]  Le Pen has surged into the number one place in major polls and those polls are spun in
[28:19.440 --> 28:22.880]  France, just like with Hillary, 10 to 15 points.
[28:22.880 --> 28:31.080]  Global polls still have her ahead, despite the fact that they have been skewing it.
[28:31.080 --> 28:39.520]  Macron plummets in the polls as Marie Le Pen enjoys boost a week away from election vote.
[28:39.520 --> 28:42.800]  And that's all being reported, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:42.800 --> 28:44.120]  It's all unfolding.
[28:44.120 --> 28:45.200]  It's all happening.
[28:45.200 --> 28:46.200]  It's beautiful.
[28:46.200 --> 28:47.200]  It's wonderful.
[28:47.200 --> 28:48.200]  It's powerful.
[28:48.200 --> 28:49.200]  Is she going to be perfect?
[28:49.200 --> 28:50.600]  Is she going to get it all done?
[28:50.600 --> 28:51.600]  No.
[28:51.600 --> 28:58.680]  She's better than the socialists and the globalists in Hollandei and the rest of them.
[28:58.680 --> 28:59.680]  Nationalism.
[28:59.680 --> 29:01.520]  We're starting to turn the corner.
[29:01.520 --> 29:03.720]  Good things are happening.
[29:03.720 --> 29:07.280]  They've got indictments on her to put her in prison pending.
[29:07.280 --> 29:09.960]  They may arrest her if she gets elected president.
[29:09.960 --> 29:11.080]  Still the fight goes on.
[29:11.080 --> 29:13.360]  That'll make her grow even faster.
[29:13.360 --> 29:17.360]  She won't be defeated if they put her in prison for a year for criticizing the precious
[29:17.360 --> 29:18.360]  Muslims.
[29:18.360 --> 29:23.120]  I think everybody start criticizing the Muslims running around, shooting, killing and stealing
[29:23.120 --> 29:25.200]  and running people over with cars.
[29:25.200 --> 29:28.560]  Well, if Marie Le Pen gets assassinated, is she a loser?
[29:28.560 --> 29:29.560]  No.
[29:29.560 --> 29:31.200]  She's like Joan of Arc 2.0.
[29:31.200 --> 29:38.080]  If I get destroyed, but we win the war, did Obi-Wan Kenobi to use the goofy allegory?
[29:38.080 --> 29:43.440]  In episode four, did he lose or did he win when he let Darth Vader cut him in two?
[29:43.440 --> 29:44.760]  Escape is not my plan.
[29:44.760 --> 29:46.440]  I will face them alone.
[29:46.440 --> 29:47.440]  Stay with us.
[29:47.440 --> 29:51.160]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the Run.
[29:51.160 --> 29:58.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:58.800 --> 30:04.000]  Although conservative commentator and culture backed out of showing up to her already canceled
[30:04.000 --> 30:09.960]  speech at Berkeley, that didn't stop freedom-loving Americans from conducting a large First Amendment
[30:09.960 --> 30:12.000]  rally in its place.
[30:12.000 --> 30:18.320]  Most social media icons such as Gavin McInnes, Lauren Southern, Baced Stickman, Baked Alaska,
[30:18.320 --> 30:24.440]  Brittany Pettibone and Faith Goldie showed up to support free speech and gave speeches.
[30:24.440 --> 30:28.840]  Reports that the Berkeley police did their job in protecting the peace have come in and
[30:28.840 --> 30:34.960]  apparently a total of six Antifa protesters were arrested, two for resisting arrest, one
[30:34.960 --> 30:39.120]  for a drug violation and another for possessing a weapon.
[30:39.120 --> 30:44.240]  A few more arrests were made earlier in the day for possession of a knife and obstructing
[30:44.240 --> 30:47.720]  an officer and wearing a mask to evade police.
[30:47.720 --> 30:52.960]  Despite these arrests, the protests remained peaceful and dialogue between both sides was
[30:52.960 --> 30:53.960]  present.
[30:53.960 --> 30:57.040]  This is Milly Weaver reporting to you for infowars.com.
[30:57.040 --> 31:02.280]  Hey everyone, Farms is Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know,
[31:02.280 --> 31:05.320]  I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[31:05.320 --> 31:09.200]  You've all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare
[31:09.200 --> 31:14.880]  nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart
[31:14.880 --> 31:17.680]  disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[31:17.680 --> 31:20.960]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone
[31:20.960 --> 31:24.120]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.

[33:28.900 --> 33:32.500]  The reason the globalists are attacking us is very simple.
[33:32.500 --> 33:39.300]  They want to use infowarsteam as a beta test, a model on how to bring down independent alternative
[33:39.300 --> 33:40.300]  media.
[33:40.300 --> 33:44.840]  And they've openly said this in hearings in Congress, they've openly said this on
[33:44.840 --> 33:54.040]  national news they want to punish me and those associated with me so that no one
[33:54.040 --> 33:59.000]  else dare challenge the globalist agenda. I'll tell you what's exciting as
[33:59.000 --> 34:04.160]  fast as we grow I see all these other new characters new researchers new
[34:04.160 --> 34:09.080]  amazing personalities popping up that are fighting the globalist at such a fast
[34:09.080 --> 34:12.680]  rate there's no way they can shut us down unless they try to shut down the
[34:12.680 --> 34:17.160]  internet itself which is what they're incrementally trying to do they want to
[34:17.160 --> 34:22.960]  turn the web into a glorified basically Netflix meets Amazon so there is that
[34:22.960 --> 34:29.240]  historic fight going on right now but it really shows you how weak the globalist
[34:29.240 --> 34:36.000]  are that George Soros's law firm that he founded is suing me with a member of the
[34:36.000 --> 34:43.360]  Federal Reserve Board of New York who promotes bringing in refugees who
[34:43.360 --> 34:47.160]  undoubtedly in the whole refugee movement have been connected to sexual
[34:47.160 --> 34:50.280]  assault does that mean the company itself brought people in no cuz
[34:50.280 --> 34:54.800]  technically the State Department does but the owner of the yogurt system is
[34:54.800 --> 35:00.240]  the one promoting it now is that defamation is that slander is that a
[35:00.240 --> 35:05.100]  lie when they first threatened us with a lawsuit over a month ago I said to the
[35:05.100 --> 35:08.360]  crew I said that headlines a little strong to say they're caught importing
[35:08.360 --> 35:12.960]  rapist I just said it go with the headline that it turns out that when
[35:12.960 --> 35:16.400]  the media claimed nobody had done a sexual assault in that case a year ago
[35:16.400 --> 35:21.280]  that they've now pled guilty and if you want to write about Shobani point out
[35:21.280 --> 35:26.040]  the owner is pushing with George Soros for the importation of people and the
[35:26.040 --> 35:30.600]  State Department system is not vetting them properly so we clarified that still
[35:30.600 --> 35:35.520]  suit us so then I talked to five top lawyers I engaged two of the groups to
[35:35.520 --> 35:40.240]  the Wall Street Journal today Shobani versus Alex Jones and all the lawyers
[35:40.240 --> 35:45.320]  say no it's a very very bad case we don't understand you already corrected
[35:45.320 --> 35:50.040]  it's clearly a publicity stunt just to put their name out there and say oh look
[35:50.040 --> 35:56.240]  they are suing the fake news purveyor Alex Jones and you read the Wall Street
[35:56.240 --> 36:02.280]  Journal oh Jones made it up that refugees are connected to sexual assault just
[36:02.280 --> 36:10.120]  like this Stasi's been hired by Facebook two years ago in Germany to go after
[36:10.120 --> 36:14.160]  people that criticize Islamist you get arrested if you do just like Marie
[36:14.160 --> 36:22.960]  Le Pen set to be the next French president under indictment for saying
[36:22.960 --> 36:27.800]  France faces its greatest threat to its existence since the Nazis invaded in
[36:27.800 --> 36:35.600]  1939 1940 totally true statement massive riots every night in Paris and other
[36:35.600 --> 36:40.280]  cities their terrorism down 80% the last decade half of that just the last two
[36:40.280 --> 36:47.840]  years total existential threat but you'll be arrested you'll be boycotted you'll
[36:47.840 --> 36:53.800]  be sued for defaming a religion and now I sit here wanting to see these people
[36:53.800 --> 36:58.440]  vetted from seven countries where they're not being vetted like Syria and
[36:58.440 --> 37:08.440]  Sudan and Libya and the lawsuit says Jones also claims Shobani's bringing in
[37:08.440 --> 37:14.320]  TB well let me clarify Shobani the company isn't doing it the owner is
[37:14.320 --> 37:18.960]  promoting bringing in refugees under a UN State Department program with the
[37:18.960 --> 37:23.760]  refugee board that he's counseled with where they're not doing proper vetting
[37:23.760 --> 37:28.840]  and that's been all over the news the border patrol has exposed that so where
[37:28.840 --> 37:33.480]  am I going with this the cops have always had a saying you can beat the
[37:33.480 --> 37:41.280]  rap you can't beat the ride we'll probably knock on wood beat this lawsuit
[37:41.280 --> 37:48.480]  but the message is don't talk like Alex Jones or we'll sue you the message is
[37:48.480 --> 37:53.520]  don't criticize open borders or we'll come after you that's globalism and
[37:53.520 --> 37:58.480]  that's why they hate Trump because our country faces an existential true threat
[37:58.480 --> 38:03.120]  to its sovereignty having our borders dissolved and the whole world told you're
[38:03.120 --> 38:06.400]  allowed to come here and expect free welfare and to have your kids for free
[38:06.400 --> 38:10.320]  and then don't assimilate join the Democratic Party and be an America
[38:10.320 --> 38:23.480]  hating group of out of control self-serving entitled idiots but the
[38:23.480 --> 38:27.960]  good news is humanity is waking up to this 21st century threat we're being
[38:27.960 --> 38:32.680]  conquered by the UN and the globalist with giant third-world waves of desperate
[38:32.680 --> 38:36.280]  people that the globalist put in those positions in most cases who are now
[38:36.280 --> 38:42.480]  besieging our once great republic now I want to get to a bunch of clips and then
[38:42.480 --> 38:47.440]  take your phone calls but one reason they're attacking us is we've had Dr.
[38:47.440 --> 38:52.040]  Blalock and we've had a Dr. Wallach and we've had countless scientists and
[38:52.040 --> 38:56.520]  surgeons and brain surgeons and epidemiologists and virologists on
[38:56.520 --> 39:00.560]  genetic engineers we've had them all and I've read hundreds and hundreds and
[39:00.560 --> 39:05.560]  hundreds and hundreds really thousands of white papers on air where
[39:05.560 --> 39:12.760]  governments admit that what they're pushing on us is hurting us and here's
[39:12.760 --> 39:21.800]  articles today out of Forbes out of CNBC out of info wars.com you name it and I
[39:21.800 --> 39:26.320]  want to just go over a few of these for you why is diet soda so bad for your
[39:26.320 --> 39:34.120]  brain that's Forbes now I remember 21 years ago having medical doctors on
[39:34.120 --> 39:39.640]  who were breaking down then in the Reese's monkey studies at Searle in the
[39:39.640 --> 39:47.200]  1970s upwards of 27 percent sometimes more of the baby monkeys died when low
[39:47.200 --> 39:54.520]  levels of aspartame were added to their milk they then did rat studies they
[39:54.520 --> 39:58.240]  could not get aspartame that's the excretion of a type of bacteria
[39:58.240 --> 40:07.760]  genetically engineered I should add they could not get it approved Donald
[40:07.760 --> 40:12.280]  Rumsfeld formerly at the Defense Department at the time came into the
[40:12.280 --> 40:17.280]  Reagan administration and got Monsanto to buy Searle and then Reagan
[40:17.280 --> 40:20.720]  administration not that Reagan knew what was going on he was a big Diet Coke
[40:20.720 --> 40:28.640]  fan he didn't know approved aspartame known as equal or NutriSweet in the
[40:28.640 --> 40:34.560]  brand names you can read it from even the HuffPost Donald Rumsfeld the strange
[40:34.560 --> 40:41.600]  history of aspartame now it's an excitotoxin at 89 degrees it turns into
[40:41.600 --> 40:47.160]  formaldehyde formaldehyde eats holes in brain tissue attacks the nerve tissue of
[40:47.160 --> 40:52.040]  the eyeballs just I'm not a scientist I've read literally hundreds of reports
[40:52.040 --> 40:56.120]  I've had probably a hundred guests on over the years by aspartame it's very
[40:56.120 --> 41:04.600]  addictive it's an excitotoxin it's a form of speed now it also makes you fat
[41:04.600 --> 41:10.160]  because it's an excitotoxin and makes you hungry so you end up eating more food
[41:10.160 --> 41:15.120]  now I remember telling people 20 years ago diet drinks make you fat and I got a
[41:15.120 --> 41:19.360]  letter in the mail threatening from a law firm to sue me I told him go ahead
[41:19.360 --> 41:28.280]  they did sue a lot of folks today even CNN admits that aspartame is causing
[41:28.280 --> 41:34.640]  brain damage problems in the optic nerve you name it so here it is Forbes why is
[41:34.640 --> 41:39.640]  diet soda making a so bad for your brain another article wise diet soda make
[41:39.640 --> 41:45.640]  you fat and it goes through all these big studies here's another one now again
[41:45.640 --> 41:50.640]  we told you 22 years ago one of my first big topics because I had the studies
[41:50.640 --> 41:55.800]  and I had guests on now who do we owe for the world knowing about this it was
[41:55.800 --> 42:02.840]  moms and pops it was average activist I knew people that would go stand on the
[42:02.840 --> 42:09.280]  corners at the supermarkets and the police were threatened to arrest them
[42:09.280 --> 42:16.800]  I've done this myself handing out flyers with facts about aspartame we've
[42:16.800 --> 42:20.560]  interviewed people whose wives and husbands died of it young with brain
[42:20.560 --> 42:23.800]  tumors and the doctor said yes the aspartame it's been well known and then
[42:23.800 --> 42:28.160]  they would go lovingly warned people because it's in children's foods it's
[42:28.160 --> 42:32.680]  in all major gums you cannot find gum at the supermarket I dare you to that
[42:32.680 --> 42:36.440]  doesn't have aspartame in it it's in the it's in the non-sugar gum it's in the
[42:36.440 --> 42:40.600]  sugar gum it's in candy now it's gone into tens of thousands of products from
[42:40.600 --> 42:47.160]  just a few because the patents up on it and it's very addicting silicon valley
[42:47.160 --> 42:50.840]  elite are flocking to an extremely high fat diet in hopes of living longer
[42:50.840 --> 42:54.680]  showing it keeps your brain cells healthier and your other cells longer as
[42:54.680 --> 42:58.880]  long as it's not a trans fat or as long as it's not been burned and that gets
[42:58.880 --> 43:02.200]  into all the technical types of fat it creates that are highly toxic but it the
[43:02.200 --> 43:09.120]  the healthiest thing to eat in the world is raw fat if it doesn't have
[43:09.120 --> 43:16.240]  bio-cumulated heavy metals or toxins in it and then you eat that with raw green
[43:16.240 --> 43:20.760]  leafy vegetables and that is the longest living people in the world I've had
[43:20.760 --> 43:29.160]  Dr. Walikon for 20 years I've had other doctors on it is a known fact of the
[43:29.160 --> 43:37.520]  elite and here it is in CNBC 20 years after we told you this is just today
[43:37.520 --> 43:43.920]  without me even trying this is why they hate us folks you know what's happening
[43:43.920 --> 43:48.800]  we talked about this with experts 20 years ago and about 15 years ago they
[43:48.800 --> 43:56.000]  began to report in mainstream news that the German elite and the British elite
[43:56.000 --> 44:01.880]  and the Chinese elite have their own quote clean vaccines that are made in
[44:01.880 --> 44:04.920]  limited allotments that don't have all the bad additives in them they're still
[44:04.920 --> 44:09.240]  going to be some side effects but learned immunity is real it's a real
[44:09.240 --> 44:13.600]  science they always lie and say that I'm saying it isn't a real science no it's
[44:13.600 --> 44:17.880]  it's a real science what they give us is a literal IQ reducer with steroids
[44:17.880 --> 44:25.600]  let's go further John Rappaport links to the psychiatric news links to the
[44:25.600 --> 44:30.480]  Journal of American Medicine and JAMA neurology and a bunch of other studies
[44:30.480 --> 44:40.760]  that Selexa, Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, Lexapro, Luvox and others all cause
[44:40.760 --> 44:49.200]  massive increases in strokes and the risk of intercranial hemorrhages folks
[44:49.200 --> 44:56.120]  what is XTC or Molly or the different variants of MDMA do the Germans invented
[44:56.120 --> 45:00.440]  in the 20s in an accident in a chemical plant can look it up by the 80s it was
[45:00.440 --> 45:03.960]  called the love drugs psychologists were handing it out to everybody it is the
[45:03.960 --> 45:08.760]  only known admitted treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder the
[45:08.760 --> 45:12.680]  problem is they had to ban it because if you start taking it every week over a
[45:12.680 --> 45:17.240]  year or so it'll eat holes in your brain and cause massive hemorrhages what
[45:17.240 --> 45:21.680]  class is the serotonin reuptake inhibitor it's in the hallucinogen
[45:21.680 --> 45:26.400]  psychotropic class what class is MDMA and the same thing it's just a lot
[45:26.400 --> 45:32.360]  stronger I had a girlfriend in college that sometimes would take like 10
[45:32.360 --> 45:39.800]  prozacs and she'd be bombed out of her head for a day in ecstasy same thing
[45:39.800 --> 45:46.000]  same same class of drugs you take that stuff every day for a couple years you
[45:46.000 --> 45:50.540]  take it for a decade everyone I know that's taken that stuff for more than a
[45:50.540 --> 45:56.840]  decade has either a skin disease where their skins totally pale or they get
[45:56.840 --> 46:02.720]  tumors or they get brain tumors or they or they have hemorrhages and die I
[46:02.720 --> 46:12.440]  probably have five I have five five or more friends that have died of brain
[46:12.440 --> 46:16.600]  hemorrhages or brain tumors that have been on prozac type drugs since high
[46:16.600 --> 46:24.680]  school and they're dying in the last few years I go to their funerals and I
[46:24.680 --> 46:29.840]  talk to their families and they go yeah it was the luvox I have a really good
[46:29.840 --> 46:35.480]  friend who went on paxil within one year got the disease verilaga what's it
[46:35.480 --> 46:37.760]  called he turned totally white look like a vampire
[46:37.760 --> 46:42.640]  started having nosebleeds and he said listen I hate it I hate it but now I'm
[46:42.640 --> 46:48.880]  totally addicted I go crazy if I don't take it here it is SSRI antiprotestors
[46:48.880 --> 46:52.120]  increased risk of intercranial hemorrhage patients being treated with
[46:52.120 --> 46:56.600]  SSRI's had a 70% increase in risk of experiencing an intercranial hemorrhage
[46:56.600 --> 47:02.400]  and that's just in their own study looking at people over a year imagine a
[47:02.400 --> 47:08.840]  decade from healthline.com an inner cranial hemorrhage ICH refers to an
[47:08.840 --> 47:12.360]  acute bleeding inside your skull or brain it's a life-threatening hemorrhage
[47:12.360 --> 47:17.840]  emergency you should go to emergency room right away or call 911 yeah the
[47:17.840 --> 47:20.440]  public has learned about the increased risk of suicide violent behavior
[47:20.440 --> 47:24.880]  including murder stemming from the use of SSRI antipresence now there's more
[47:24.880 --> 47:29.080]  study published Friday in JAMA neurology has found that patients taking
[47:29.080 --> 47:33.440]  antipresence that are strong inhibitors of serotonin reuptake may be an
[47:33.440 --> 47:37.840]  increased risk for intercranial hemorrhage particularly during the first
[47:37.840 --> 47:41.480]  month of use and then over time it gets worse but it's that first month's the
[47:41.480 --> 47:48.000]  really bad time it goes on the journal psychiatry says that you can kill you in
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.800]  the first seven days this is just a study on the first few months of use
[47:51.800 --> 47:58.600]  there's other ones on long-term use it eats holes in your brain it makes your
[47:58.600 --> 48:01.560]  brain do things it's not supposed to meanwhile you know what I do when I'm
[48:01.560 --> 48:07.400]  down a little bit I take 5-HTP which is just a normal brain chemical you buy at
[48:07.400 --> 48:11.560]  the store like 20 bucks a bottle and I take knockout which has plants that have
[48:11.560 --> 48:18.600]  the same thing in it I don't take it every night by the way knockouts 1995
[48:18.600 --> 48:24.960]  L-triptophan serotonin from organic sources valerian root that has the plant
[48:24.960 --> 48:31.600]  compounds lemon balm chamomile and other known things and my lawyer who wrote the
[48:31.600 --> 48:36.080]  Texas family cuz one of the top lawyers in Texas has had been on four
[48:36.080 --> 48:40.280]  different things sleep studies you name it he said knockout changed his life he
[48:40.280 --> 48:43.960]  looks 10 years younger and literally just just says he wants to come on air and
[48:43.960 --> 48:49.760]  talk about it because it changed his life ladies and gentlemen it's mother
[48:49.760 --> 48:54.240]  nature totally natural totally healthy and it does the opposite it gives your
[48:54.240 --> 49:01.920]  brain the chemicals that are being depleted and when they get depleted you
[49:01.920 --> 49:05.040]  take these chemicals that still force the brain to carry out those functions it
[49:05.040 --> 49:08.280]  will start dragging other chemicals through the blood brain barrier other
[49:08.280 --> 49:12.240]  than serotonin or dopamine and cause brain damage and that's in the medical
[49:12.240 --> 49:16.680]  literature I didn't mean to go into a plug separately on knockout it's just
[49:16.680 --> 49:21.520]  sunshine clean water herbs up that's what the apothecaries with the old ancient
[49:21.520 --> 49:25.800]  doctors in every culture that was one half of medicine was plants herbs apothecaries
[49:25.800 --> 49:31.360]  that's what the pharmacy is it's why the pharmacy symbols a bowl with a stone
[49:31.360 --> 49:37.920]  mallet or stone grinder to grind the herbs to drink them as a tea to drink
[49:37.920 --> 49:41.680]  them as an oil and all we've done is brought back all the best stuff that's
[49:41.680 --> 49:46.040]  out there but I didn't mean to get into that the point is here we are telling you
[49:46.040 --> 49:52.480]  SSRIs eat holes in your brain and give you all sorts of problems where you get
[49:52.480 --> 49:57.280]  aneurysms and intercranial bleeding and strokes and all sorts of other crap
[49:57.280 --> 50:04.080]  that's what it does it's hardcore it's in the hallucinogen family that's what
[50:04.080 --> 50:10.400]  psychotropics are okay maybe you took acid five times in college change your

[55:15.160 --> 55:21.040]  declassified in 2001 but not publicly disseminated so WikiLeaks released this
[55:21.040 --> 55:28.160]  and this is the stuff they tried to hire my dad for back in the 1980s and by the
[55:28.160 --> 55:31.360]  way he wasn't that special they were trying to hire most the top implant

[56:15.080 --> 56:19.000]  turn a cat into a cyborg spy by implanting it with a microphone and
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.960]  antenna the cat had a microphone antenna and battery pack electrically embedded
[56:23.960 --> 56:28.160]  into its skin so the feline could act as a covert recording device recently
[56:28.160 --> 56:31.240]  declassified documents show how the scientists responsible for the cruel
[56:31.240 --> 56:36.160]  research were praised by spy chiefs for their pioneering work you know the big
[56:36.160 --> 56:40.040]  stuff's nano tech inside the body and for 50 years they've had soldiers
[56:40.040 --> 56:47.240]  drinking liquid liquid oxygen basically in a water base into the lungs there's
[56:47.240 --> 56:50.720]  Aquaman all of it and it's all public but the general public hears it just

[57:30.560 --> 57:33.880]  yeah I'm gonna be honest I didn't even read the whole article I just went off
[57:33.880 --> 57:38.240]  memory I said 1980s I'm sorry it's 1960s I read another article this weekend that
[57:38.240 --> 57:41.480]  didn't say that it didn't say when I just knew that my dad was told about it
[57:41.480 --> 57:46.120]  in the 1980s and he said you know no thanks I don't think I'm gonna be
[57:46.120 --> 57:54.800]  involved in that so there you go ladies and gentlemen oh it's so funny ha ha

[1:00:24.640 --> 1:00:28.360]  they become agent smith I mean I've got people literally just come out of the

[1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:45.680]  spiritual battle happening on this planet marilla pin is up in the polls she
[1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:48.960]  is neck-and-neck in many polls despite the fact that the French government's
[1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:52.280]  trying to spin polls against her and it said it's the French government's job to
[1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:57.080]  defeat her French election week lapin closing gap with Macron in many polls
[1:00:57.080 --> 1:01:01.800]  it's up on info wars.com here's a John Bowne report breaking it all down why
[1:01:01.800 --> 1:01:06.720]  is info wars under such mega attack well we know why we're promoting
[1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:13.040]  nationalism free market capitalism local sovereign control and comparing that
[1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:19.320]  to unelected globalism is very easy and very popular and they know we're
[1:01:19.320 --> 1:01:24.200]  exponentially growing so they want to shut us down as a way to intimidate
[1:01:24.200 --> 1:01:27.680]  everybody else and as a way to set a precedent as I said earlier first
[1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:32.320]  authoritarian movements shut down the independent press that is criticizing the
[1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:36.680]  power structure then it begins to actually persecute and go after people
[1:01:36.680 --> 1:01:40.720]  claiming their spies are involved in espionage they admit in the news three
[1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:44.280]  months ago congressional hearings I'm under criminal investigation for actually
[1:01:44.280 --> 1:01:49.960]  being a Russian spy it's been a cozy relationship from the beginning I will
[1:01:49.960 --> 1:01:55.520]  not let you down you will be very very impressed I hope and I think we'll be
[1:01:55.520 --> 1:01:59.920]  speaking a lot to Donald Trump and Alex Jones the nation and all of our
[1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:03.760]  freedoms hang by a thread and the military apparatus of this country is
[1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:10.480]  about to be handed over to scum were beholden to scum Russian scum you got all
[1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:15.600]  that it's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones I
[1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:23.200]  don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be I
[1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:30.120]  began to realize she isn't angel and she wants to help me no you've got to be
[1:02:30.120 --> 1:02:35.120]  sent for reprogramming
[1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:53.120]  Russian scum the stay behind networks the deep state operatives the shadow
[1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:58.200]  government that won't leave why are they coming after us look at Le Pen
[1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:05.120]  Francis Le Pen on offensive with a vote a week away she's now a head even in
[1:03:05.120 --> 1:03:09.720]  their twisted polls against her competitor in the runoff Le Pen's
[1:03:09.720 --> 1:03:15.800]  Euro contortions underlined French reluctance to exit can Le Pen beat
[1:03:15.800 --> 1:03:22.240]  Marron Macron in the French election despite losing in the first round this
[1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:25.800]  is a big deal ladies and gentlemen and even if she loses think of a
[1:03:25.800 --> 1:03:30.960]  nationalist anti-global is that close to winning that's why they want to punish
[1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:35.600]  her she's under criminal indictment and they're trying to disqualify her right
[1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:40.400]  now and are saying even if she wins they're going to arrest her she's a
[1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:44.040]  member of the EU parliament so she had immunity oh yeah the EU gave herself
[1:03:44.040 --> 1:03:50.320]  immunity but now they're trying to strip that immunity the fake job scandal
[1:03:50.320 --> 1:03:54.600]  involving Francis far right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen could
[1:03:54.600 --> 1:03:59.120]  amount to some five million euros according to Agents France press
[1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:03.840]  investigators have unearthed new evidence suggesting 17 other front
[1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:09.000]  national deputies are involved among them her partner Louis Alliot and front

[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:23.360]  thousand euros earlier this month French prosecutors asked the European
[1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:27.600]  parliament to lift her immunity from prosecution
[1:04:43.040 --> 1:04:47.960]  the words gone out lawsuits attacks whatever it takes we're gonna shut you

[1:08:36.840 --> 1:08:44.040]  also want to get more into some video clips that are up on infowars.com with
[1:08:44.040 --> 1:08:49.120]  Maxine Waters saying Trump's illegal immigration comments are racist dog
[1:08:49.120 --> 1:08:56.120]  whistles they're also now saying again that anybody that makes the a okay
[1:08:56.120 --> 1:09:02.720]  symbol is a white supremacist and I guess it's supposed to say the three
[1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:12.000]  fingers mean white or like W and then I guess power and upside down P ladies and
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:18.960]  gentlemen that's total schizophrenia total mental illness that the system is
[1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:26.360]  trying to give the public is the W hotel racist is it's a W the W means
[1:09:26.360 --> 1:09:33.120]  W and the H means howl Hitler white Hitler that sounds crazy doesn't it
[1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:39.280]  because it is crazy some of my listeners think that when I do the a okay
[1:09:39.280 --> 1:09:44.760]  sign that I'm saying Illuminati they claim that's Illuminati no I grew up
[1:09:44.760 --> 1:09:50.840]  with it in jello commercials and there was some type of coconut milk in a can
[1:09:50.840 --> 1:09:53.520]  I heard there was like a black guy had a cool voice when I was a little kid he'd go
[1:09:53.520 --> 1:10:02.000]  coconut ah ah coconuts from Jamaica can somebody find that ad on YouTube I bet
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:06.760]  if you go to YouTube and put in ah coconut that we can find that ad it was
[1:10:06.760 --> 1:10:10.480]  like and then he started doing the almond joy ads too so he did coconut milk
[1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:16.160]  ads he did almond joy and that's how I got it my head and then jello had ads
[1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:21.600]  throughout the 80s and stuff and I was still a kid then a teenager where it
[1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:27.480]  didn't build Cosby do that and say mmm delicious the point is it means a okay
[1:10:27.480 --> 1:10:33.680]  my dad whenever something's a okay I'm like hey I bring the right shingles up
[1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:38.760]  or the right hammer and he have nails in his mouth and he'd do a okay and it
[1:10:38.760 --> 1:10:42.920]  means an international sign language a okay in fact before I even give the
[1:10:42.920 --> 1:10:49.760]  number out and hit other news let's play Paul Joseph Watson's report dealing
[1:10:49.760 --> 1:10:53.960]  with this because it just illustrates how crazy everything's gotten it's up on
[1:10:53.960 --> 1:11:00.800]  infowars.com because then Mike Cernovich got weak passes into the White House
[1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:09.840]  press corps and he and another reporter went hey we got him obviously trolling
[1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:13.520]  the media knowing they'd say that but Trump does it all the time when Trump
[1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:19.400]  says I'm gonna handle it are you guaranteed we're going to end up cutting
[1:11:19.400 --> 1:11:22.600]  your taxes that clip's coming up next he was a speech today saying we're gonna
[1:11:22.600 --> 1:11:26.360]  cut him we're gonna get the economy going in all corporate language that
[1:11:26.360 --> 1:11:31.000]  means it's handled well I love about Trump's mannerisms as he waves his arms
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:35.040]  around like I do I have pretty much the same mannerisms as Trump I wasn't
[1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:39.280]  trained in mannerisms I didn't go to college for it I've had media people
[1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:43.480]  ask why I wave my arms around I've had Italians come out so many times my
[1:11:43.480 --> 1:11:47.680]  rallies and events even at my grandfather's funeral I gave a speech
[1:11:47.680 --> 1:11:50.800]  and this Italian guy that was in his church came up and he goes I loved your
[1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:54.640]  grandpa but by the way are you Italian you wave your arms around even more than
[1:11:54.640 --> 1:12:00.920]  we do but that's just what I do I can't help it I talk with my hands and Trump
[1:12:00.920 --> 1:12:05.560]  does the exact same mannerisms I mean I've gone back to videos I did 15 years
[1:12:05.560 --> 1:12:11.040]  ago and it's this hand signal it's this hand signal it's that hand signal it's
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:16.080]  the thumb it's it's it's it's pointing they say don't point people don't like
[1:12:16.080 --> 1:12:21.920]  it well guess what Trump points they found it they found the coconut guy was
[1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:31.000]  it for coconut milk what is it for yeah it's for coconut milk what is it seven
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:37.600]  up okay see I remembered like coconut milk or something or almond joy showing
[1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:42.400]  my memory seven up no caffeine Jeffrey Holder but I think he did ads for other
[1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:45.600]  people too here here let's back him up and play this go ahead and start it from
[1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:52.320]  the beginning place oh it's there's no audio on that computer okay well as soon
[1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:56.880]  as you can download it will play it so I just remember him doing the hand signs
[1:12:56.880 --> 1:13:03.160]  does he do it in the ad like I remember he just did it okay I missed that see
[1:13:03.160 --> 1:13:08.880]  boom from 40 years ago I was like three years old when those ads were on I
[1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:14.800]  remember but I guess they ran through the 80s as well on screen there it is yeah
[1:13:14.800 --> 1:13:19.200]  1983 commercial seven up no caffeine but it ran earlier than that as well as I
[1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:24.200]  remember him remember the house we lived on and where the TV was and remember
[1:13:24.200 --> 1:13:27.320]  watching that ad on all the time I remember it okay I'm gonna stop right
[1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:32.120]  there here is Paul Joseph Watson's report and people said well this is
[1:13:32.120 --> 1:13:37.440]  silliness why even cover it because the ADL the anti-defamation league of the
[1:13:37.440 --> 1:13:47.400]  neighborhood was set up in 1913 by the Jewish mafia in New York because they
[1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:51.120]  kept it in trouble you know bugsy Siegel and people doing things and so they set
[1:13:51.120 --> 1:13:55.400]  it up to then go after anybody that ever criticized Jewish mafia and whenever I
[1:13:55.400 --> 1:13:58.320]  say that it's all over the news that I'm this anti-Semite and I hate Jews but
[1:13:58.320 --> 1:14:01.920]  then David Duke doesn't like me and the Nazis all hate me everybody knows I don't
[1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:05.360]  dislike Israel I'm not anti-Jew but there's Italian mafia there's Irish
[1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:09.160]  mafia there's Jewish mafia there's Jamaican mafia there's Russian mafia
[1:14:09.160 --> 1:14:13.220]  there's Japanese mafia there's Chinese mafia there's Taiwanese mafia there's
[1:14:13.220 --> 1:14:17.600]  Laotian mafia there's Mexican mafia there's Brazilian mafia there's Colombian
[1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:21.320]  mafia you don't dislike Colombians when you say they got a really dangerous mean
[1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:26.560]  mafia they're just known to be dangerous to me like anybody else so the ADL was
[1:14:26.560 --> 1:14:33.680]  set up by a guy named Jones strangely enough I've read the history of it you
[1:14:33.680 --> 1:14:37.520]  can read it too mainline history to like go after anybody that criticized the
[1:14:37.520 --> 1:14:43.520]  Jewish mafia as anti-Semitic and so then Nazi collaborators give a money like
[1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:47.520]  George Soros they get him awards our Arnold Schwarzenegger does and every
[1:14:47.520 --> 1:14:51.160]  time the media when I talk about the ADL and its bad past or how they've lost
[1:14:51.160 --> 1:14:54.800]  lawsuits or how they've been caught you know breaking into police departments
[1:14:54.800 --> 1:14:58.840]  and stealing files on people I mean they're a serious organization they say
[1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:04.400]  always anti-Semitic he says is Jewish mafia well yeah the Jewish mafia protects
[1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:08.360]  Nazis like George Soros yes so I'm not against Jews I'm for Jews that's why
[1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:13.240]  I'm exposing it but the media will never report that I'm exposing the Jewish
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:17.040]  mafia that in World War two worked with Hitler to shake Jews down who were
[1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:20.040]  trying to get out of Europe and who demanded a big stake and cut of the
[1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:23.680]  money the ADL wasn't involved in that but some of the Jewish mafia's in Europe
[1:15:23.680 --> 1:15:29.800]  were like George Soros they just cover up for the Jewish mafia and it's
[1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:33.040]  horrible to help round up Jews and send them to death camps like George Soros
[1:15:33.040 --> 1:15:36.320]  did and if that's anti-Semitic then I'm anti-Semitic because I don't support
[1:15:36.320 --> 1:15:39.240]  people that round up Jews and send them to death camps but when I'm attacked in
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:43.560]  hundreds of newspapers tomorrow for saying that they will not tell you what
[1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:47.960]  I said about the rest of it and that's how it works that's how it works in
[1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:52.640]  America because it's all pure deception you expose Arnold Schwarzenegger for
[1:15:52.640 --> 1:15:56.160]  loving Hitler you expose George Soros for working with Hitler helping round up
[1:15:56.160 --> 1:16:00.800]  Jews for the thousands that's anti-Semitic that's the ADL what's that
[1:16:00.800 --> 1:16:04.920]  tell you about the ADL well they've come out and said Mike Cernovich and the lady
[1:16:04.920 --> 1:16:10.200]  that he's with are anti-Semitic because they said a okay we got our passes
[1:16:10.200 --> 1:16:14.800]  because they've said Trump is anti-Semitic for saying a okay and its code
[1:16:14.800 --> 1:16:18.200]  word ladies and gentlemen I've studied symbols I never heard anybody until the
[1:16:18.200 --> 1:16:21.640]  last year say that's a white power symbol that is the biggest load of
[1:16:21.640 --> 1:16:26.800]  baloney the earth has ever seen it means a okay is the black actor in the
[1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:34.600]  seven-up commercial saying delicious I guess aspartame loaded sugar-free you
[1:16:34.600 --> 1:16:40.000]  know globalist garbage he's saying it's a okay that's a symbol chefs do that
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:45.040]  when they walk up they say you're gonna love this meal in fact if you do that
[1:16:45.040 --> 1:16:50.360]  symbol and then kiss your lips French and Italian cuisine it means it's the
[1:16:50.360 --> 1:16:52.520]  best out there I haven't done this in a while I'm gonna skip this break so we
[1:16:52.520 --> 1:16:56.280]  have more time with my beloved John Harmon up at GCN so let's go ahead and
[1:16:56.280 --> 1:17:02.840]  go to the evil report here it is and then we'll show you the seven-up ad here
[1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:10.360]  it is doing the okay hand sign now means you're a neo-nazi that's according to the
[1:17:10.360 --> 1:17:14.440]  independent who published an entire article defaming Mike Cernovich and
[1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:18.680]  Cassandra Fairbanks as white supremacists the same independent that
[1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:23.840]  simultaneously writes hit pieces about me while begging for an interview the
[1:17:23.840 --> 1:17:28.400]  article was based on a tweet by fusion reporter Amanda Roller which said just
[1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:32.000]  two people doing the white power hand gesture in the white house the
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:36.120]  independent said the anti-defamation lead characterizes the symbol as a racist
[1:17:36.120 --> 1:17:42.960]  hand sign and that's fake news the ADL never said doing the okay symbol was a
[1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:47.360]  quote racist hand sign they were talking about a completely different hand
[1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:51.640]  sign using two hands where one hand forms the letter W and the other hand
[1:17:51.640 --> 1:17:56.840]  forms the letter P to represent WP or white power and the independent is so
[1:17:56.840 --> 1:18:02.800]  stupid they literally debunk themselves in their own article by pointing this
[1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:07.280]  out I don't know which is more retarded calling Cernovich a white supremacist
[1:18:07.280 --> 1:18:12.680]  when he has a Persian wife and a mixed race baby pretty white supremacist
[1:18:12.680 --> 1:18:16.920]  calling Cassandra Fairbanks a white supremacist when she's Puerto Rican
[1:18:16.920 --> 1:18:22.280]  or completely falling for a 4chan troll that set out to fool verified libtards
[1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:27.320]  on Twitter into thinking the okay sign had been co-opted by neo-nazis that's
[1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:31.920]  literally what 4chan said and they fell for it the fact that I even have to
[1:18:31.920 --> 1:18:36.840]  explain this to you morons makes me want to kill myself
[1:18:36.840 --> 1:18:44.240]  Trump does the okay sign when he's making a point hand gesture with an L
[1:18:44.240 --> 1:18:48.600]  shape so it's right here it looks precise right now where she was he's got
[1:18:48.600 --> 1:18:54.520]  this mail just like other politicians do this thumb-to-fist thing when they're
[1:18:54.520 --> 1:19:01.760]  making a point Trump does it to make a point not to signal white supremacy
[1:19:01.760 --> 1:19:07.560]  Cernovich Fairbanks and everyone else do it because they're Trump supporters not
[1:19:07.560 --> 1:19:15.080]  because they're white supremacists you idiots it's called a meme he has noted
[1:19:15.080 --> 1:19:20.040]  white supremacist Barack Obama doing the okay sign this black Trump supported
[1:19:20.040 --> 1:19:24.360]  us it too must be a white supremacist this ten-year-old kids definitely a
[1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:28.240]  white supremacist here's another white supremacist not all people who have a
[1:19:28.240 --> 1:19:33.720]  different opinion to you a white supremacist have you grasped that yet
[1:19:33.720 --> 1:19:38.160]  unfortunately for libtards constantly smearing people as neo-nazis
[1:19:38.160 --> 1:19:42.840]  because they're too thick to come up with an actual counter argument is no
[1:19:42.840 --> 1:19:47.400]  longer an option Fairbanks says she's suing the independent and possibly the
[1:19:47.400 --> 1:20:07.160]  moron who first defamed her as a white supremacist in the tweet listen okay
[1:20:07.160 --> 1:20:15.600]  signs aren't racist milk isn't racist cartoon frogs aren't racist not looking
[1:20:15.600 --> 1:20:21.080]  someone in the eye isn't racist by trivializing racism to such a ludicrous
[1:20:21.080 --> 1:20:26.960]  degree you make actual racists and white supremacists look reasonable in
[1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:38.160]  comparison to your hysterical idiocy you utter krettens by the way I make
[1:20:38.160 --> 1:20:42.040]  mistakes for a channeling when I do I had own up to it I hadn't watched Paul's
[1:20:42.040 --> 1:20:44.400]  report I watched most of them and I hadn't seen it yet I just knew it would
[1:20:44.400 --> 1:20:48.520]  be good so I played it tying it into all this I'd seen all the mainstream news
[1:20:48.520 --> 1:20:53.640]  articles the last month saying the ADL said that the okay sign was racist and
[1:20:53.640 --> 1:20:58.280]  I was and I do stand by what I said up on other issues about the ADL but I
[1:20:58.280 --> 1:21:01.520]  guess that was even too stupid for them I guess now they've explained that that's
[1:21:01.520 --> 1:21:05.160]  not what they meant because it was so ridiculous so this is even too out of
[1:21:05.160 --> 1:21:10.360]  control for the ADL and by the way the ADL is gone after real racist you know
[1:21:10.360 --> 1:21:14.560]  white supremacists kill people murder black groups that's fine do that all day
[1:21:14.560 --> 1:21:18.160]  but don't sit there and then paint everybody that you politically don't
[1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:23.160]  agree with on gun control or open borders as racist it just doesn't hold
[1:21:23.160 --> 1:21:27.640]  water like calling Trump a racist in the news I'm gonna play that clip in a
[1:21:27.640 --> 1:21:32.200]  minute Maxine Waters saying that he's racist and it's a code word and it's a
[1:21:32.200 --> 1:21:37.320]  dog whistle to say we've got to have a border does Mexico having a southern
[1:21:37.320 --> 1:21:41.760]  border in the southern sense and deporting illegals does that mean they
[1:21:41.760 --> 1:21:46.280]  hate other Latin Americans no they understand those are poorer countries
[1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:50.600]  bringing crime and they can't just let unlimited unvetted people in that's why
[1:21:50.600 --> 1:21:54.520]  when I fly into Cancun or Puerto Vallarta to see those beautiful beaches and
[1:21:54.520 --> 1:21:58.120]  and the great Mexican culture and the great food and the great art when I go
[1:21:58.120 --> 1:22:02.600]  down there to get laid back because there is a laid-back vibe when I go down
[1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:06.320]  to Isla maheras or wherever I've got to fill out forms I got to say where I'm
[1:22:06.320 --> 1:22:09.600]  staying what I'm doing how long I'll be there and if you stay a day or two
[1:22:09.600 --> 1:22:14.080]  longer they call your hotel and say why are you not here and you get arrested or
[1:22:14.080 --> 1:22:17.640]  fined at the airport
[1:22:19.120 --> 1:22:25.640]  because Mexico's its own country that's what countries do now let's talk about
[1:22:25.640 --> 1:22:31.720]  what's really really racist against the human race our one race what I covered
[1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:36.300]  last hour why is diet soda bad for your brain forbs as pertain making you

[1:23:07.920 --> 1:23:11.200]  brain hemorrhages and death and intercranial hemorrhaging that's on
[1:23:11.200 --> 1:23:20.840]  infowars.com with links to all the major government news sites now since we
[1:23:20.840 --> 1:23:26.960]  mentioned it here's the seven up commercial with the black actor from the
[1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:31.600]  1970s and 80s if you're a radio listener I'll narrate it doing the okay
[1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:37.800]  sign to say it's high quality soda here it is. This is where they grow seven up
[1:23:37.800 --> 1:23:43.800]  and from these seven up gets its natural light refreshing taste crisp and clean
[1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:49.760]  and no caffeine never had it never will now you already know how much caffeine
[1:23:49.760 --> 1:23:54.480]  Pepsi and Coke have but did you know that mellow yellow and mountain you have
[1:23:54.480 --> 1:24:06.640]  even more caffeine. I'll just try doing something like that around here good
[1:24:06.640 --> 1:24:10.600]  healthy drink without the caffeine in that nice and of course a few years later
[1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:14.600]  they started putting aspartame another drinks both Pepsi and of course
[1:24:14.600 --> 1:24:19.160]  Coca-Cola that was Jeffrey Holder according to the media another noted
[1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:24.040]  white supremacist because he had the double sign and look I know you know
[1:24:24.040 --> 1:24:26.800]  this is idiotic you're probably sick of me talking about it the reason I'm
[1:24:26.800 --> 1:24:32.480]  harping on it is they want to be able to take anything in language they want
[1:24:32.480 --> 1:24:37.200]  and declare it Prasada non grata to say it's not allowed to say that you can't
[1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:42.360]  do it to say that you can't have it to say you can't have Halloween parties at
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:48.640]  colleges to say you can't have a dorm named Lynch Hall because a rich
[1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:52.360]  Democrat gave money to build a hall because the word Lynch is in it
[1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:56.200]  triggers people to think of blacks being a lynched and so they remove the name
[1:24:56.200 --> 1:25:01.080]  this is how they attack language this is how they attack culture now I've got

[1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:15.960]  millions of dollars we lost in the advertising they took away but they're
[1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:19.840]  targeting everybody they're targeting myself Bill O'Reilly you name it not

[1:34:21.680 --> 1:34:26.880]  Al Gore and I'm going to do a review today I'm going to shoot a review in HD at

[1:34:50.720 --> 1:34:54.960]  Gore is the savior of the world and of course pay him car taxes he'll save you
[1:34:54.960 --> 1:34:59.680]  while they ignore all the real threats the GMO the genetic engineering the

[1:35:18.440 --> 1:35:23.680]  ties into it I'm going to show my press conference Friday where everybody from
[1:35:23.680 --> 1:35:27.720]  the Huffington Post to the Daily Beast to the Austin American States when they
[1:35:27.720 --> 1:35:32.400]  all laughed at me and NBC laughed at me and they'd all giggled and said he's
[1:35:32.400 --> 1:35:40.200]  crazy he thinks they're crossing humans with animals and then one writer said
[1:35:40.200 --> 1:35:48.040]  oh sure we're injecting human cells into pigs no they're creating part human
[1:35:48.040 --> 1:35:54.560]  part pigs part human part monkey part human part fish part fish part insect and
[1:35:54.560 --> 1:35:59.280]  it's crossing the genetic line of diseases that previously only insects
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:03.520]  got humans wouldn't get or the pig could get something we couldn't get it it's
[1:36:03.520 --> 1:36:08.960]  called zoological diseases and zoological viruses and zoological

[1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:56.280]  you've got a middle-ear problem and so everything's spinning I mean I guess
[1:36:56.280 --> 1:37:02.480]  vertigo is that you know the term but they've got vertigo and some people and
[1:37:02.480 --> 1:37:07.200]  I know in Austin are having to leave Austin because the pollen is so bad
[1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:11.320]  they're getting year-round vertigo and I mean these aren't hypochondriacs these
[1:37:11.320 --> 1:37:14.600]  people that run marathons these are people that are high-powered lawyers
[1:37:14.600 --> 1:37:20.000]  these are people that are super smart and people are leaving Austin in fact I've
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:25.160]  said this many times there it is allergies and dizziness the cause and the
[1:37:25.160 --> 1:37:28.800]  treatment that's not a health line and it's getting worse and worse no one had
[1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:34.120]  this 30 40 years ago it's the GMO is triggering autoimmune responses where
[1:37:34.120 --> 1:37:38.000]  now the natural environment is killing us it's like that movie the happening
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:45.920]  where the trees start killing everybody I went to Hawaii zero allergies I got
[1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:52.640]  off the plane sick in 10 minutes I go to the desert somewhere no allergies I
[1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:57.000]  come back here used to be a month out of the year then two months now I've been
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:01.560]  dealing with allergies for six months and if I wasn't drinking more water and
[1:38:01.560 --> 1:38:06.160]  taking x2 and things it'd be even worse because I'm doing okay I just get
[1:38:06.160 --> 1:38:09.200]  headaches and sneeze and feel crappy I just bull through it a lot of people
[1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:13.320]  can't pull through it but I'll tell you if I start getting vertigo and dizzy like
[1:38:13.320 --> 1:38:22.920]  a lot of people are getting I gotta go my son's in super good shape exercises all
[1:38:22.920 --> 1:38:32.480]  the time taller than I am and he's had vertigo for two days in bed from allergies
[1:38:32.480 --> 1:38:39.680]  took him to the doctor and I'm saying this isn't natural folks it isn't normal
[1:38:39.680 --> 1:38:44.400]  you look at people and they look sick they look weirded out everywhere they
[1:38:44.400 --> 1:38:47.160]  look like zombies you hear the conversations it's super dumb down and
[1:38:47.160 --> 1:38:51.880]  it's just getting worse and worse I talk to people all over New York Kentucky
[1:38:51.880 --> 1:38:55.880]  Tennessee California they've all got super bad allergies and they say yeah
[1:38:55.880 --> 1:38:59.600]  just a few years ago I wasn't sick like this all the time I don't know what's
[1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:07.560]  going on well something's going on people and we're all the elites moving
[1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:16.440]  Tasmania and Kauai and they're very controlled there through the government
[1:39:16.440 --> 1:39:22.080]  of Australia and the government of state government of why they won't let any
[1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:27.200]  other new plants in no new stuff they said he's basically decontamination when
[1:39:27.200 --> 1:39:32.560]  you come in and there's a reason the elite are going there and he gets worse
[1:39:32.560 --> 1:39:37.800]  than that they've got pharmacological farms growing all over the United States
[1:39:37.800 --> 1:39:43.320]  were for 30 years they can program crops like corn to produce live vaccines
[1:39:43.320 --> 1:39:48.080]  chemicals anything they want plants are magic you can program them to grow
[1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:54.640]  basically anything you want the problem is they're giving off pollen the bees
[1:39:54.640 --> 1:39:59.520]  are getting it they're dying they're spreading it to other plants they are
[1:39:59.520 --> 1:40:03.680]  now seeing things like corn growing out of oak trees in Texas that never
[1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:07.440]  happened before but they've spliced the corn with so many other genetics of
[1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:14.120]  plants and animals and other insects that it's now jumping species into other
[1:40:14.120 --> 1:40:19.720]  animals and jumping in the same I guess
[1:40:20.440 --> 1:40:29.840]  plant kingdom in the flora and is now jumping within the flora family into
[1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:35.520]  other plants and it's getting exponentially worse and I'm like why are
[1:40:35.520 --> 1:40:39.720]  they doing this why are they geoengineering why are they poisoning
[1:40:39.720 --> 1:40:43.440]  why are they releasing all these GMO things in the open why are they doing
[1:40:43.440 --> 1:40:47.520]  it and you can see the result it's killing everything the plants are dying
[1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:51.800]  the insects are dying the birds are dying you go to big forest all over the US
[1:40:51.800 --> 1:40:56.880]  now they're like quiet I talked to the forest service people I talked to the
[1:40:56.880 --> 1:41:00.400]  biologist I talked to the animal biologist I talked to everybody they
[1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:06.120]  say something's going on aluminum is up 10 times or more on average in places
[1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:10.400]  like California in the soil and people don't know why they're spraying it out
[1:41:10.400 --> 1:41:18.840]  of the jet fuel it's added to the jet fuel it's been declassified and I'm
[1:41:18.840 --> 1:41:24.760]  sitting here talking about this covering it and Trevor Noah makes jokes about it
[1:41:24.760 --> 1:41:30.000]  when I can type in right now council on farm relations geoengineering of planet
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:35.720]  earth NASA geoengineering of planet earth energy department sprays barium
[1:41:35.720 --> 1:41:41.160]  salts aluminum dioxide patents patents for spraying for adding aluminum to
[1:41:41.160 --> 1:41:45.760]  oxide barium salts to jet fuel for aerosol distribution to create a
[1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:51.800]  sunscreen to stop global warming you'll read patents you'll read UN reports and
[1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:57.960]  you'll read the energy department saying they're doing it now and something I've
[1:41:57.960 --> 1:42:04.200]  noticed because used to just 15 years ago and on no matter what time of year it
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:09.160]  was so-called condensation trails even during the summer at low altitude now
[1:42:09.160 --> 1:42:15.040]  have you noticed suddenly since Trump got in that chem trails are down like
[1:42:15.040 --> 1:42:19.640]  90% fact I haven't been seeing any of them not in the winter when they're
[1:42:19.640 --> 1:42:24.040]  supposed to be forming airplane contrails may be creating accidental geoengineering
[1:42:24.040 --> 1:42:27.880]  that's the Smithsonian that's their little whitewash oh they're accidentally
[1:42:27.880 --> 1:42:32.760]  creating it no when they add barium salt aluminum dioxide or other radioactive
[1:42:32.760 --> 1:42:37.000]  isotopes it creates artificial nuclei and then forms cloud banks it's called
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:42.880]  cloud seeding I'm digressing I said I'd go to your phone calls but first because
[1:42:42.880 --> 1:42:47.800]  I mentioned it let me play because they're demonizing the a-ok sinus white
[1:42:47.800 --> 1:42:53.640]  power they're demonizing all languages evil now we have Maxine water
[1:42:53.640 --> 1:42:57.400]  saying Trump's illegal immigration comments are racist and a dog whistle
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:43:03.080]  lady the one pushing racism's you and pushing war with Russia saying Russia
[1:43:03.080 --> 1:43:07.520]  invaded Korea I mean you're as dumb and out of touch as Nancy Pelosi who said
[1:43:07.520 --> 1:43:15.720]  George W. Bush was president again on Sunday who are these ding bats retire
[1:43:15.720 --> 1:43:20.120]  already lady but you didn't know where Russia was on a map 50 years ago did you
[1:43:20.120 --> 1:43:25.080]  Pelosi did your waters you're a bunch of rich ladies put in there by the elites
[1:43:25.080 --> 1:43:27.920]  because you'll do whatever you're told
[1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:33.160]  let's play the clip I want to let you listen to Donald Trump last night at his
[1:43:33.160 --> 1:43:37.840]  Pennsylvania rally going back at this issue of immigration with his supporters
[1:43:37.840 --> 1:43:40.280]  take a listen
[1:43:40.840 --> 1:43:47.040]  year after year you pleaded for Washington to enforce our laws as illegal
[1:43:47.040 --> 1:43:52.880]  immigration surge refugees flooded in and lax vetting threatened your
[1:43:52.880 --> 1:43:57.640]  family's safety and security
[1:43:57.640 --> 1:44:04.280]  you're pleased have finally been there oh don't worry we're gonna have the wall
[1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:13.240]  don't worry about your response congresswoman that is absolutely racist
[1:44:13.240 --> 1:44:20.200]  that's that dog whistling that's saying to people this is what is happening in
[1:44:20.200 --> 1:44:26.520]  America with you and all the problems that we have he's using the Latino
[1:44:26.520 --> 1:44:33.880]  population and Mexicans right across the border to create fear in his
[1:44:33.880 --> 1:44:38.960]  constituency and those people who tend to want to believe that it is absolutely
[1:44:38.960 --> 1:44:44.440]  divisive no leader no president should be saying and doing the kinds of things
[1:44:44.440 --> 1:44:49.040]  that he's doing just to keep a constituency together it's outrageous
[1:44:49.040 --> 1:44:53.000]  the Democrats are the party the KKK they're the one race baiting we can't
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:56.360]  have a totally open border nobody has that that's a free country we can't just
[1:44:56.360 --> 1:45:02.400]  have unvetted coming in and we've had a 53% or 43% drop in illegals coming in
[1:45:02.400 --> 1:45:07.200]  just the last few months since president Trump got in she's the one
[1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:12.160]  race baiting but I love how the reporter acts like they caught you know
[1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:17.040]  juniors stealing money out of mama's purse the other reporter says what do
[1:45:17.040 --> 1:45:21.040]  you think of this like boy we caught him saying something amazing that our
[1:45:21.040 --> 1:45:25.920]  country could actually have a border that's the disgusting nature of this
[1:45:25.920 --> 1:45:31.400]  brainwashing but since we're playing Trump clips let's go to one more of
[1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:35.200]  these Trump mocks White House correspondents dinner at the PA rally that
[1:45:35.200 --> 1:45:39.640]  mesmerized folks over the weekend let's play this clip and I'm going right to
[1:45:39.640 --> 1:45:46.360]  Ron and other callers here it is as you may know there's another big gathering
[1:45:46.360 --> 1:45:52.480]  taking place tonight in Washington DC did you hear about it
[1:45:52.480 --> 1:46:04.600]  a large group of Hollywood actors
[1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:16.280]  being a celebrity sucks Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel
[1:46:16.280 --> 1:46:22.360]  ballroom in our nation's capital right now that's right then we're laughing at
[1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:29.760]  Trump a year ago not laughing now they are gathered together for the White
[1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:35.400]  House correspondence dinner without the president
[1:46:35.400 --> 1:46:50.960]  and I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away
[1:46:50.960 --> 1:46:57.360]  from Washington swap exactly who wants to be part of these elites and their
[1:46:57.360 --> 1:47:02.680]  power trips with all of you their arrogance and with a much much larger
[1:47:02.680 --> 1:47:08.400]  crowd and much better people right that's right this is all about the elites
[1:47:08.400 --> 1:47:12.640]  being a joke royalty being a joke the new royalty Hollywood being a joke they
[1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:16.280]  set themselves up as if they're the controllers of culture they're losing
[1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:20.120]  control they can't stand it that's why they want to destroy me you Trump
[1:47:20.120 --> 1:47:24.360]  everybody Trump's far from perfect he's being pushed into confrontation with
[1:47:24.360 --> 1:47:29.400]  Russia Syria North Korea's belligerent that's a problem but he's got to stand
[1:47:29.400 --> 1:47:34.680]  up to North Korea but on the economy media back there they would actually
[1:47:34.680 --> 1:47:40.000]  rather be here I have to tell you oh yeah most of camera folks are with us this
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:44.080]  is this is about populism folks it's bigger than Trump it's about breaking
[1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:47.800]  with the system breaking with the elites that's right
[1:47:47.800 --> 1:48:00.640]  that wall which by the way they got a lot of Mexican contractors and US
[1:48:00.640 --> 1:48:04.040]  contractors want to build I said let Mexico help build it Mexico's got its
[1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:09.120]  own fence and wall down there they better Guatemala's collapsed like CNN and
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:16.440]  MSNBC are fake news they are their enemies enemies the American people and
[1:48:16.440 --> 1:48:21.200]  then Gergen says oh he's so hateful the most divisive sitting and they're
[1:48:21.200 --> 1:48:27.280]  wishing in Washington they're watching right now they're watching and they
[1:48:27.280 --> 1:48:32.040]  would love to be with us right here tonight absolutely a bunch of fake
[1:48:32.040 --> 1:48:38.800]  mummies but they're trapped at the dinner which will be very very boring
[1:48:38.800 --> 1:48:45.240]  most people that work for the system but next year hated maybe we'll make it
[1:48:45.240 --> 1:48:49.960]  more exciting for them in Washington it will show up but we have a good chance
[1:48:49.960 --> 1:48:55.600]  of showing up here again next year too that's right take the power away from
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:49:00.480]  them stop letting MSM dictate where you have a rally or what you do or where you
[1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:05.200]  go or who you talk to or oh my gosh the MSM's attacking you the MSM's calling
[1:49:05.200 --> 1:49:08.360]  you all these names the MSM is doing nothing to try to destroy you and your
[1:49:08.360 --> 1:49:12.600]  family that's because they're scum you've got to call their bluff and let
[1:49:12.600 --> 1:49:18.520]  yourself have the fight with them they're not real they're fake that's why
[1:49:18.520 --> 1:49:22.440]  they call us fake all day all right let's go to James in California we've got
[1:49:22.440 --> 1:49:27.240]  Iran skits Bido Jessica and others James thanks for holding her on the ear
[1:49:27.240 --> 1:49:31.920]  oh hello Alex I've been a lessoner since the your parents on the Joe Rogan
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:35.360]  podcast and I just wanted to say how great it is to get someone else to
[1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:41.400]  understand the real dangers of aspartame growing up my family always warned me
[1:49:41.400 --> 1:49:45.880]  about the dangers of it saying how it would like to be cancer give you all
[1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:50.480]  those tumors like you were mentioning and I don't think like a lot of the
[1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:55.400]  people really understand how it really is the silent killer from most people like
[1:49:55.400 --> 1:49:59.600]  you can see that our defects like obesity that's killing millions of people
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:04.680]  every year and it's just really concerning to see that's right and it's
[1:50:04.680 --> 1:50:07.760]  not like I just guessed 22 years ago exposing a people were exposing it when
[1:50:07.760 --> 1:50:12.040]  it was made legal back in 1981 since day one they couldn't get it approved in the
[1:50:12.040 --> 1:50:16.360]  70s people been fighting this since the 70s when it was invented they had they
[1:50:16.360 --> 1:50:21.160]  had developed a type of bacteria they could eat toxic waste and they noticed
[1:50:21.160 --> 1:50:27.600]  the GMO bacteria then would would excrete or defecate out aspartame a sweet
[1:50:27.600 --> 1:50:32.320]  tasting poison it's very addictive so it's like a science fiction movie a sweet
[1:50:32.320 --> 1:50:36.560]  tasting poison from a GMO bacteria that they put in everything now I'm gonna
[1:50:36.560 --> 1:50:39.720]  come back and let you finish up James as I went to that your call a little bit
[1:50:39.720 --> 1:50:43.160]  late we'll come back and talk more about that so I wasn't a trailblazer
[1:50:43.160 --> 1:50:47.480]  exposing aspartame but it's one more thing now in Forbes everywhere admitting
[1:50:47.480 --> 1:50:52.360]  it makes you fat gives you brain tumors kills you just like Prozac thank you
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:56.080]  James we'll come right back to you stay with us

[1:56:30.520 --> 1:56:34.920]  they were on top of this way before anyone else like kids on the street would

[1:56:49.400 --> 1:56:54.880]  to convince people of these things like a simple thing like food they see it as a
[1:56:54.880 --> 1:57:00.680]  staple of their life and they don't want to give it up well God bless you brother

[1:57:41.760 --> 1:57:49.840]  it was when they take away my choice of whether to vaccinate my children or my
[1:57:49.840 --> 1:57:56.360]  grandchildren because of them 60 that would be the time and I voiced my
[1:57:56.360 --> 1:58:04.720]  opinion RFK son was here you know advocating you know to not mandate
[1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:08.360]  vaccines but isn't it great that Trump put him on that to head up that
[1:58:08.360 --> 1:58:15.820]  Commission I hope so because I believe that the health care will never ever be
[1:58:15.820 --> 1:58:22.000]  fixed because we are you know dysfunctionally we are not healthy

[2:00:34.040 --> 2:00:37.840]  sterilants in vaccines i know they've been given vaccine liability protection

[2:00:42.280 --> 2:00:49.000]  with autism 30 years ago 35 years ago to one in 56 now the only place that gives

[2:02:09.560 --> 2:02:14.720]  whole family and and it's really disgusting and and i hate it and that's
[2:02:14.720 --> 2:02:22.480]  why i love your nutraceuticals because this is at the crux of of how we can
[2:02:22.480 --> 2:02:29.800]  win if we get healthier we our minds will be clear and we will be able to
[2:02:29.800 --> 2:02:36.640]  attack you know the problems i went to a doctor who he was the head
[2:02:36.640 --> 2:02:43.240]  pathologist at columbia presbyterian he left western medicine because he just
[2:02:43.240 --> 2:02:48.720]  you know what he was finding was you know the diseases were not caused by
[2:02:48.720 --> 2:02:55.160]  what what western medicine was trying to feed us well they admit most of it is
[2:02:55.160 --> 2:02:58.600]  is deficiencies and i've had medical doctors on about that if you don't have
[2:02:58.600 --> 2:03:01.760]  vitamin C you die if you don't have good iodine you die if you don't have
[2:03:01.760 --> 2:03:05.280]  oxygen you die if you don't have water you die if you don't have iron you die
[2:03:05.280 --> 2:03:09.960]  these are facts and it's admitted that scurvy is rampant across the western
[2:03:09.960 --> 2:03:14.040]  world because of malabsorption in the gut because of people's bad diets and
[2:03:14.040 --> 2:03:18.160]  they just don't know that something like leafy vegetables would make their
[2:03:18.160 --> 2:03:23.640]  life so much better the before you know what i get dropped here i the most
[2:03:23.640 --> 2:03:29.280]  important thing is that the healthcare people this this new bill coming up i
[2:03:29.280 --> 2:03:35.800]  want to see nutraceuticals paid for by insurance companies yes it is
[2:03:35.800 --> 2:03:41.520]  absolutely huge it's the it is the biggest thing that we could do because
[2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:48.120]  that will drive down the cost we don't need these drugs my my doctor you know
[2:03:48.120 --> 2:03:57.960]  he has 50 recliner chairs he feeds ozone into people intervenously for
[2:03:57.960 --> 2:04:03.680]  glutathione the vitamin c absolutely it's it's revolutionizing so much ron
[2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:08.280]  you're an amazing caller thank you so much for calling folks that caller is so
[2:04:08.280 --> 2:04:13.760]  on target we need to go back to the apothecary that was just ground herbs
[2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:19.080]  and oils and essential cofactors that the ancients had developed every culture
[2:04:19.080 --> 2:04:23.520]  had them whether it was the apothecaries of the Middle East or whether it was the
[2:04:23.520 --> 2:04:27.080]  apothecaries of the Armenians or whether it was the apothecaries of Western
[2:04:27.080 --> 2:04:31.200]  Europe or the apothecaries of China you go look at the ancient formulas they're
[2:04:31.200 --> 2:04:35.920]  similar because they found out it's it what really work and you always find
[2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:38.720]  some stuff the superstitious or whatever but most of it was based in reality
[2:04:38.720 --> 2:04:42.720]  that's a whole nother area of medicine that's just been walled off and lost and
[2:04:42.720 --> 2:04:49.200]  it should be covered by your insurance a show should having a nutritionist so the
[2:04:49.200 --> 2:04:54.840]  caller is absolutely right we'll be a right back stay with us
[2:04:57.680 --> 2:05:02.720]  although conservative commentator and culture backed out of showing up to her

[2:09:03.960 --> 2:09:08.680]  you where it shows ISIS cutting Trump's head off and it's not a Muslim doesn't
[2:09:08.680 --> 2:09:13.560]  look like a Muslim just like we have women wearing hajjibs we have women
[2:09:13.560 --> 2:09:21.040]  wearing hajjibs and saying it's part of working with Islam and and and and
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:28.080]  demystifying it so again those stories are up on info wars comm left his t-shirt
[2:09:28.080 --> 2:09:33.360]  a Mayday rally shows ISIS beheading Donald Trump and I told you that I went
[2:09:33.360 --> 2:09:38.960]  out to rallies in the last two years and saw people with ISIS flags ISIS signs
[2:09:38.960 --> 2:09:43.840]  it's like avant-garde it's cutting-edge it's trendy it's cool just like we've
[2:09:43.840 --> 2:09:46.920]  seen North Korea kill millions of its own people through starvation Venezuela
[2:09:46.920 --> 2:09:50.960]  totally collapsing Cuba a nightmare communist China a nightmare for the
[2:09:50.960 --> 2:09:55.840]  people but at the universities there's the Mao groups and the Red Guard and
[2:09:55.840 --> 2:10:00.280]  it's really fashionable in Colorado and in New York in places they have
[2:10:00.280 --> 2:10:04.920]  restaurants about Mao and about linen and the kids get tattoos of it it's
[2:10:04.920 --> 2:10:09.200]  really sexy to talk about the red terror and all the death and all the
[2:10:09.200 --> 2:10:13.920]  destruction and all the evil but they want to live here driving their nice
[2:10:13.920 --> 2:10:18.640]  cars that mommy and daddy got them and using their expensive smartphones the
[2:10:18.640 --> 2:10:24.440]  capitalism gave them so Mayday is the communist workers day it's also an
[2:10:24.440 --> 2:10:29.760]  ancient occult day the left-hand path of the Jacobins so we have Mayday because
[2:10:29.760 --> 2:10:33.720]  of the French Revolution not a revolution but a violent hateful
[2:10:33.720 --> 2:10:38.160]  revolution they wanted to overthrow God country not just royalty and create a
[2:10:38.160 --> 2:10:44.000]  nine-day work week with no holidays and a ruling class of absolute God kings over
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  the people and communism came out of the Jacobins that's admitted history but the
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:53.680]  average person doesn't know they want disorder they want death they want
[2:10:53.680 --> 2:10:58.080]  destruction but only to bring them to absolute power they want regime change
[2:10:58.080 --> 2:11:04.640]  for destabilization and total control they want a red terror a season of the
[2:11:04.640 --> 2:11:09.240]  abyss and that's what they get Paris chaos is rioters erupt on streets
[2:11:09.240 --> 2:11:13.640]  against election candidate Marie Le Pen who's now in the lead many polls the
[2:11:13.640 --> 2:11:17.880]  latest 100 arrest for classical police in Germany protesters decrying Texas
[2:11:17.880 --> 2:11:25.320]  sanctuary cities Bill stage sit in isn't that cute but you notice O Cuba is
[2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:29.520]  having its first Mayday with the new Castro oh it's hereditary power like
[2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:33.680]  North Korea joining us and then I promise I'm gonna go to your calls before I go
[2:11:33.680 --> 2:11:39.080]  to Roger Stone and breaking news I will get to skits and Beto and Jessica just
[2:11:39.080 --> 2:11:42.160]  stay there I'm gonna get to all of you and Dean and Isaac so I want to hear what
[2:11:42.160 --> 2:11:46.000]  Jessica has to say on cop supporting Trump I want to hear what Beto has to say
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:49.560]  on Trump's first hundred days skits once talk about Trump Isaac was talking
[2:11:49.560 --> 2:11:54.200]  about Trump and Jared and Ivanka speaking of that months ago he wrote
[2:11:54.200 --> 2:11:57.600]  about it Steve Pachinic calm three weeks ago or so he came out and said
[2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:01.600]  watch it's gonna come out he's been compromised by communist China and sure
[2:12:01.600 --> 2:12:06.600]  enough it was in the New York Times last Friday that Jared Kushner's tied
[2:12:06.600 --> 2:12:10.360]  into that now he's got some breaking factoids former State Department head
[2:12:10.360 --> 2:12:13.760]  of psychological operations worked with other agencies was involved in regime
[2:12:13.760 --> 2:12:18.280]  change you name it did the Camp David Accord successfully has a great
[2:12:18.280 --> 2:12:21.920]  pedigree co-wrote books with of course Tom Clancy he's also a medical doctor
[2:12:21.920 --> 2:12:27.000]  psychiatrist and military veteran and that's Dr. Steve Pachinic I just invited
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:30.320]  him on the show to see what's going on other topics he's got but I tell you
[2:12:30.320 --> 2:12:35.320]  watching a bunch of spoiled brats celebrate collectivism and communism
[2:12:35.320 --> 2:12:39.720]  all over the world today as they're trying to run from North Korea into
[2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:43.720]  China because it's quasi-free market they're trying to run from Cuba here
[2:12:43.720 --> 2:12:47.200]  they're running from Venezuela to get out of there I mean where is this
[2:12:47.200 --> 2:12:51.720]  utopia on Mayday Dr. Pachinic I know your family your dad was in the French
[2:12:51.720 --> 2:12:55.920]  Army World War two got driven out some died in the Holocaust then you went to
[2:12:55.920 --> 2:13:01.360]  Cuba then you came here you're uniquely I think vetted with the pedigree to
[2:13:01.360 --> 2:13:07.040]  speak about the wonders of communism on Mayday well as you know there are no
[2:13:07.040 --> 2:13:13.280]  wonders of communism my former signing on the Nixon and then on the Reagan and
[2:13:13.280 --> 2:13:19.640]  Bush was to create the architecture for the takedown of the Soviet Union I did
[2:13:19.640 --> 2:13:24.080]  that at the Rand Corporation came back into the Reagan administration under
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:28.800]  Baker and then under Bush and we were successful in taking it down without any
[2:13:28.800 --> 2:13:34.040]  soldiers the reason is very simple it's not that I'm all that great or we were
[2:13:34.040 --> 2:13:38.720]  great and regime change it was that Soviet Union and communism just didn't
[2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:44.600]  work and it was rotten from the inside I had men who were walking in the streets
[2:13:44.600 --> 2:13:48.680]  at literally seven in the morning totally drunk no jobs they were had
[2:13:48.680 --> 2:13:53.400]  factories which were making things that were not useful the army was not very
[2:13:53.400 --> 2:13:58.320]  effective the intelligence service could be bought off so forth and so on so
[2:13:58.320 --> 2:14:03.600]  communism the notion of the left and the ideology of the left is all fine and
[2:14:03.600 --> 2:14:08.840]  good but in reality it has no credibility it has no viability it has no
[2:14:08.840 --> 2:14:14.700]  legs to stand on so when you're young you want to protest and rebel the
[2:14:14.700 --> 2:14:22.760]  Jacobean Revolution was under Rev. Pierre did effectively bring in Napoleon the
[2:14:22.760 --> 2:14:29.600]  Russian Revolution effectively brought in Stalin now what I'm about to say is
[2:14:29.600 --> 2:14:33.040]  going to be a little disconcerting to you and your listeners but it's very
[2:14:33.040 --> 2:14:38.560]  important for me to say this right now the revolution you had started Alex
[2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:43.840]  nothing to do with communism had to do with the voice of America and shifting
[2:14:43.840 --> 2:14:49.800]  us to the alternative right or whatever narrative we want to use new right new
[2:14:49.800 --> 2:14:54.680]  right the point I'm trying to make and I wrote this several weeks ago was the
[2:14:54.680 --> 2:15:00.560]  following when Alex Jones get gets compromised for whatever reason I you
[2:15:00.560 --> 2:15:06.080]  know I I'm sorry you had to go to court I saw that issue then I saw that Fox
[2:15:06.080 --> 2:15:10.920]  News was in trouble and Riley was compromised then I saw that Bannon was
[2:15:10.920 --> 2:15:16.040]  compromised now I see that Gork is compromised so basically what we have
[2:15:16.040 --> 2:15:21.520]  now Alex is a counter-revolution or basically what's happening in any
[2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:27.120]  revolution it's what Hitler did in the night of the long knives when he took
[2:15:27.120 --> 2:15:31.200]  care of his essay people and he exterminated them that's right first
[2:15:31.200 --> 2:15:34.320]  they politically shut down your voice before they physically shut you down
[2:15:34.320 --> 2:15:38.640]  and when you use the word compromised I'm not backing down or giving up under
[2:15:38.640 --> 2:15:44.600]  this organized assault that's why I I state this to the audience and I say it
[2:15:44.600 --> 2:15:49.800]  to you I wrote that and I still mean that you are the American icon however the
[2:15:49.800 --> 2:15:53.560]  orders came out there's no question in my mind now it came out of the White
[2:15:53.560 --> 2:15:57.800]  House because the Clintons could never do this the left doesn't have that kind
[2:15:57.800 --> 2:16:01.720]  of intelligence they don't have that kind of capability but within the
[2:16:01.720 --> 2:16:06.000]  structure of McMaster the National Security Council and the fact that
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:12.400]  we're mobilizing both into North Korea into Afghanistan Iraq and Syria it
[2:16:12.400 --> 2:16:15.860]  became obvious to me that whatever orders came out of the Trump
[2:16:15.860 --> 2:16:20.480]  administration whether it was Jared or it was McMaster didn't matter to me
[2:16:20.480 --> 2:16:26.800]  basically what it said is we're going to shut up the voices of the alternative
[2:16:26.800 --> 2:16:30.240]  right no I've got it Trump doesn't want or his people don't want the weapons
[2:16:30.240 --> 2:16:33.880]  lying around that brought him to power just like that's normally happens in
[2:16:33.880 --> 2:16:37.360]  revolution whoever helps you get in you end up destroying I don't think Trump's
[2:16:37.360 --> 2:16:42.920]  doing that himself but it's very very clear that that that this is being
[2:16:42.920 --> 2:16:46.520]  directed because look Trump didn't get rid of that office that Obama set up
[2:16:46.520 --> 2:16:50.720]  that was designed to go after the the new right and so basically it's just been
[2:16:50.720 --> 2:16:55.200]  taken on and now we see this gutting taking place or this attempt well the
[2:16:55.200 --> 2:16:59.280]  gutting where what I'm getting at is it's exactly right Alex you know this I
[2:16:59.280 --> 2:17:03.960]  know this is the history of all revolutions whether it's the left or the right
[2:17:03.960 --> 2:17:08.400]  immediately those we bring to power whether they're generals or civilians in
[2:17:08.400 --> 2:17:13.440]  the senior ranks they have never been in the forefront of any revolution our
[2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:18.600]  generals were three four stars or whatever they sit back they use the
[2:17:18.600 --> 2:17:23.560]  system then when they get in the position of power they try to eliminate any of
[2:17:23.560 --> 2:17:28.680]  the voices of agitation propaganda that comes out from you that would have come
[2:17:28.680 --> 2:17:32.160]  out from Bannon that would have come out from Gorka that would have come out
[2:17:32.160 --> 2:17:37.600]  from any other people from my point of view this was part of the system and I
[2:17:37.600 --> 2:17:41.400]  was waiting for it to happen that's right let's be clear historically it's
[2:17:41.400 --> 2:17:45.640]  because they don't want people who effectively led peaceful revolution
[2:17:45.640 --> 2:17:51.240]  still around in case they go sideways they know we can remove them so what do
[2:17:51.240 --> 2:17:55.640]  you think I should do about this well number one the reason I'm coming on the
[2:17:55.640 --> 2:17:59.880]  show and one is to show my support to you as I said you're both a friend and
[2:17:59.880 --> 2:18:04.320]  you're an American icon number two I think you should consistently maintain
[2:18:04.320 --> 2:18:12.480]  the dialogue that we we not not banning not rape art not the mercers no one
[2:18:12.480 --> 2:18:16.760]  else no other generals there isn't one general who has the guts to come forth
[2:18:16.760 --> 2:18:21.020]  in a revolution they just not that way they're socialized to be within their
[2:18:21.020 --> 2:18:26.040]  own system almost the socialization system or social socialism they're
[2:18:26.040 --> 2:18:29.600]  specialized in their own little paradigm to control the correct and the
[2:18:29.600 --> 2:18:34.560]  paradigm is a dangerous one because it demands a lot of money from us the tax
[2:18:34.560 --> 2:18:38.320]  payers and at the same time it's the expansion of one again
[2:18:38.320 --> 2:18:43.240]  Halliburton KBR they're all over Djibouti they're all over Africa so
[2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:47.960]  basically they're in their own ivory tower forbidden city delusional and they
[2:18:47.960 --> 2:18:52.040]  are scared of the power that brought them to power correct I know for a fact
[2:18:52.040 --> 2:18:56.080]  that Trump wanted to continue to work with us but the elites told him no you
[2:18:56.080 --> 2:19:00.160]  can't do that well when's it gonna end they're always gonna demand more more
[2:19:00.160 --> 2:19:06.000]  more from him but they never compromise well it's that's correct Alex it has to
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:12.400]  now depend on the character of Trump if in fact he's a man of his word a man of
[2:19:12.400 --> 2:19:17.600]  his conviction not mercurial not suddenly waving around and bringing in the
[2:19:17.600 --> 2:19:22.720]  people he does not know or bringing in Jared Kushner with the Steinmetz family
[2:19:22.720 --> 2:19:27.440]  in the Israelis and the Goldman Sachs boys none of whom have been tutored in
[2:19:27.440 --> 2:19:32.840]  anything to do with national security national at farm domestic farm policy
[2:19:32.840 --> 2:19:37.760]  but we're structured now to be in a position of several wars at the same
[2:19:37.760 --> 2:19:44.480]  time North Korea has been has been in a position where for the past 20 to 30
[2:19:44.480 --> 2:19:50.560]  years our military has developed was called the 502 7 plan or 502 9 plan
[2:19:50.560 --> 2:19:55.800]  with the army Navy Marines special forces can preempted an attack on North
[2:19:55.800 --> 2:20:02.080]  Korea in Afghanistan we have Marines going back in after our Marines were
[2:20:02.080 --> 2:20:07.480]  killed in exactly the same place we have a 15-year war we have Marines that
[2:20:07.480 --> 2:20:12.800]  were stationed special forces in Syria with artillery and with how it's
[2:20:12.800 --> 2:20:18.440]  soldiers and soldiers in effect what we have is a military out of control once
[2:20:18.440 --> 2:20:24.080]  again which has never performed effectively never not since the Korean
[2:20:24.080 --> 2:20:27.520]  War not since the Vietnam let me just stop you there let's look at the water
[2:20:27.520 --> 2:20:32.240]  front I even told my lawyer three weeks ago I said I've looked at this attack
[2:20:32.240 --> 2:20:35.600]  and I said I guarantee you the people in the Trump administration that are
[2:20:35.600 --> 2:20:39.440]  forming this deep state coup to capture the president which they've almost
[2:20:39.440 --> 2:20:44.000]  completed at many levels they see us as a threat and I said this is being
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:47.720]  directed by people inside the White House I said these attacks are too
[2:20:47.720 --> 2:20:53.000]  concerted too coordinated but I said I know it's not Trump doing it because he
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:58.440]  the very same people sabotaging him backbiting him like Enrich did saying
[2:20:58.440 --> 2:21:01.560]  he's not gonna drain the swamp Trump's bringing jobs back he's exposing
[2:21:01.560 --> 2:21:08.400]  globalism he's doing a lot of good things like killing TPP but clearly he's
[2:21:08.400 --> 2:21:12.640]  got people culling the Patriots out organizing to go after the Freedom
[2:21:12.640 --> 2:21:17.400]  Caucus but here's the good news their attacks on us the Democrats the Soros
[2:21:17.400 --> 2:21:22.200]  groups Soros is a very law firm that he founded in New York's the ones suing me
[2:21:22.200 --> 2:21:28.120]  with the yogurt maker of the Islamist if you expand on that and you look at all
[2:21:28.120 --> 2:21:32.080]  the groups that are coming after us it's all completely and absolutely
[2:21:32.080 --> 2:21:35.800]  coordinated but here's the good news our listeners see it they're only
[2:21:35.800 --> 2:21:40.240]  intensifying our support we're only getting more affiliates we're only in
[2:21:40.240 --> 2:21:43.600]  the face of this becoming more successful it's backfire just like
[2:21:43.600 --> 2:21:48.000]  media attacks only help Trump so then I'm not stupid I realize oh my god
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  they're only assassinating my character because they probably I think are
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:56.120]  beginning to move into the zone where they might trump something up pun
[2:21:56.120 --> 2:21:59.960]  intended or actually kill me what do you think they're not gonna kill you there's
[2:21:59.960 --> 2:22:05.280]  no reason to kill you they tried a verbal assassination it didn't work I mean
[2:22:05.280 --> 2:22:11.160]  with all these nonsensical comedians with a Colbert or Samantha B or whatever
[2:22:11.160 --> 2:22:15.600]  it was no one listens to that anymore it's antiquated they're basically on
[2:22:15.600 --> 2:22:19.880]  their own sinking ship most people don't but some sweet-minded people that I've
[2:22:19.880 --> 2:22:25.840]  been around actually do well the point is this it's not about a few that the
[2:22:25.840 --> 2:22:30.400]  mainstream that we've created and that you've created and that part of our
[2:22:30.400 --> 2:22:34.960]  intelligence and military was part of and then suddenly they turned around to
[2:22:34.960 --> 2:22:41.480]  try to desiccate or try to eviscerate us that's not gonna work because contrary
[2:22:41.480 --> 2:22:46.000]  to their understanding of the American people where this is not the old times
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:51.200]  with medley this is not the old times with anybody else who brought them to
[2:22:51.200 --> 2:22:55.920]  power this is a new time when the internet and people like ourselves can
[2:22:55.920 --> 2:23:00.520]  create a lot of problems for our own establishment now once again the
[2:23:00.520 --> 2:23:04.920]  military industrial complex is far more important than Giovanni you know the
[2:23:04.920 --> 2:23:08.800]  Turkish man who wants to sue you for yogurt let him do that it's a waste of
[2:23:08.800 --> 2:23:13.240]  time and money your character strong enough and you're smart enough and you're
[2:23:13.240 --> 2:23:17.520]  witty enough almost reminds me of this guy Bill Hicks but of course you're not
[2:23:17.520 --> 2:23:23.560]  he so your brilliance is so sharp that it's a knife in itself you continue to
[2:23:23.560 --> 2:23:28.240]  be what you are but I want to tell you that there was no question in my mind
[2:23:28.240 --> 2:23:33.760]  that this was a concerted effort by the White House to tame down or eviscerate
[2:23:33.760 --> 2:23:38.400]  the very people who were brought to power just to be nice I'm not that smart
[2:23:38.400 --> 2:23:41.680]  I'm following the blueprint of Americana but let's let me let's buy back from this
[2:23:41.680 --> 2:23:46.840]  what do you expect him to do next what what do you see the Indian being the
[2:23:46.840 --> 2:23:50.960]  next move being well what they're gonna do next is try to expose any
[2:23:50.960 --> 2:23:55.920]  vulnerabilities that you may have again or I may have or any one of the number
[2:23:55.920 --> 2:24:00.960]  people who are not following the trend or not you know succumbing to the
[2:24:00.960 --> 2:24:06.240]  military industrial complex you're talking about KBR in Djibouti having an
[2:24:06.240 --> 2:24:10.600]  incredible presence when we have no national security interests in Sudan
[2:24:10.600 --> 2:24:14.880]  Somalia or any of the African by the way I've had a lot of special forces people
[2:24:14.880 --> 2:24:18.480]  that just got back tell me that some senior ones the exact same thing that
[2:24:18.480 --> 2:24:21.680]  it's a disaster that we're wrecking it that we're looting it and so they're
[2:24:21.680 --> 2:24:25.440]  very upset but separately let me just give you some good news I don't want to
[2:24:25.440 --> 2:24:31.480]  give sources out obviously but let's just say this I know Mike Cernovich's
[2:24:31.480 --> 2:24:35.200]  sources the government knows his sources so it's not a secret to them but
[2:24:35.200 --> 2:24:37.880]  it's obviously who's been retweeting him and saying he's a great guy and
[2:24:37.880 --> 2:24:41.600]  retweeting our stuff there are people very close to the president who are for
[2:24:41.600 --> 2:24:46.560]  real hell it's not a secret it's his sons especially Donald Jr. is a total
[2:24:46.560 --> 2:24:50.520]  patriot and there's a bunch of other people so Trump is for real but he's
[2:24:50.520 --> 2:24:54.200]  being pulled by every side and there are folks inside the White House
[2:24:54.200 --> 2:24:59.000]  threatening nuclear option to release information if they continue this but
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:02.280]  but there is an attempt to have a soft coup against the president what do we do
[2:25:02.280 --> 2:25:07.440]  about that well and we go back once again this revolution was started with a
[2:25:07.440 --> 2:25:11.560]  coup and then a counter coup and right now they have a soft coup where they've
[2:25:11.560 --> 2:25:16.160]  taken over and now I think Eric Jr. has to come into the forefront I've
[2:25:16.160 --> 2:25:21.560]  repeatedly said that Jared has to leave there's no question he's involved in
[2:25:21.560 --> 2:25:25.880]  corruption with the Chinese there's no question he's involved in corruption with
[2:25:25.880 --> 2:25:30.720]  the Israeli family the Steinmetz who were already indicted for dining
[2:25:30.720 --> 2:25:34.760]  smuggling and illegal activities I'm saying this to the attorney general
[2:25:34.760 --> 2:25:40.480]  Jeff Sessions he knows very well that this family the Kushner family and the
[2:25:40.480 --> 2:25:45.280]  Steinmetz's are totally corrupt we cannot have that in the White House this is
[2:25:45.280 --> 2:25:51.000]  not a nepotism republic this is a republic that forced it it fought its way
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:25:56.720]  by people like you me and others who went to war Kushner never went to war the
[2:25:56.720 --> 2:26:02.280]  Israelis never went to war with us Mossad was 9-11 the Israelis were
[2:26:02.280 --> 2:26:06.800]  involved in 9-11 we have the neocons coming back I am warning the
[2:26:06.800 --> 2:26:12.320]  administration again and again I did not take the time and the effort and the
[2:26:12.320 --> 2:26:17.720]  liberty and the risk that others are willing to do to bring back the pathetic
[2:26:17.720 --> 2:26:23.040]  neocons like Elliott Abrams or John Bolton or any one of these morons that
[2:26:23.040 --> 2:26:27.200]  you're putting in there if McMaster doesn't understand how he came to power
[2:26:27.200 --> 2:26:32.840]  he came to power because Tom Clancy and I gave him money in Arncath he came to
[2:26:32.840 --> 2:26:39.200]  power because he sat on the boards of other companies Mr. Flint Mr. Mattis
[2:26:39.200 --> 2:26:43.560]  was on the board of Dynacorp he was on the board of another company if the
[2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:47.680]  generals really think they are that great they better look into the mirror
[2:26:47.680 --> 2:26:51.840]  they have never won a war they have never taken down a regime and they have
[2:26:51.840 --> 2:26:56.800]  failed repeatedly in executing any military action this has been our
[2:26:56.800 --> 2:27:04.160]  history before Korea before Vietnam we lost 55,000 men because the generals
[2:27:04.160 --> 2:27:09.160]  were incompetent ignorant and they had a dereliction of duty I go back to
[2:27:09.160 --> 2:27:14.280]  McMaster this is a dereliction of duty anything he wants to do now and of
[2:27:14.280 --> 2:27:19.080]  course structure bringing out the soldiers into North Korea and thinking
[2:27:19.080 --> 2:27:23.160]  that you can preempt an attack on North Korea when they're 30 miles away from
[2:27:23.160 --> 2:27:30.680]  Seoul is both idiotic and inept at the same time continuing a war for 15 years
[2:27:30.680 --> 2:27:35.240]  in Afghanistan where thousands of our Marines were killed in helmet province
[2:27:35.240 --> 2:27:40.000]  and then putting more Marines in is nothing more than a barbaric stupidity
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:44.960]  at the same time putting in artillery and how it serves into Syria when you
[2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:49.640]  have no idea who the Alawites are you have no idea how many Christians that
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:54.200]  Bashar families protecting millions of them and you're gonna do regime change
[2:27:54.200 --> 2:27:58.720]  because you have some moron named Pompeo who's head of the CIA because he was
[2:27:58.720 --> 2:28:02.640]  number one at West Point but had never been in intelligence never been
[2:28:02.640 --> 2:28:06.240]  overseas really never understood anything except doc we're almost out of
[2:28:06.240 --> 2:28:08.720]  time you got to come back in the next few days and really flesh this out as I
[2:28:08.720 --> 2:28:12.000]  promise you go to calls and we have a Roger Stone with some breaking news but
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:15.280]  this is the minute or two we have left I love what Trump's doing transferring
[2:28:15.280 --> 2:28:19.120]  power from the globalist back he's doing a lot of great things the economy TPP
[2:28:19.120 --> 2:28:22.600]  we've talked about it so many good things so I think he's for real we know
[2:28:22.600 --> 2:28:27.480]  he's for real there is an internal struggle the Lister's need to go out of
[2:28:27.480 --> 2:28:31.440]  these rallies to send letters to the president to call into C-span to call
[2:28:31.440 --> 2:28:35.200]  in to talk radio to create the buzz that we didn't elect Jared Kushner and
[2:28:35.200 --> 2:28:39.040]  Ivanka Trump and that we you know want the president to do something about the
[2:28:39.040 --> 2:28:42.560]  war on the press the war on the Liberty Movement that is taking place but more
[2:28:42.560 --> 2:28:47.240]  importantly our listeners need to support your work my work and others
[2:28:47.240 --> 2:28:52.200]  work as an act of resistance financially in the face of the attacks the lawsuits
[2:28:52.200 --> 2:28:56.080]  the kicking us off Google ads you name it because the again the attacks are
[2:28:56.080 --> 2:29:00.320]  intensifying we're a beta test and if they're able to shut down info wars the
[2:29:00.320 --> 2:29:04.640]  sky's the limit that's correct I do agree with you and they won't shut you down
[2:29:04.640 --> 2:29:09.440]  they're not that stupid if they're that stupid then they're self-destructive but
[2:29:09.440 --> 2:29:13.560]  if that happens we will do an alternative channel don't worry Alex well I mean
[2:29:13.560 --> 2:29:16.940]  honestly they got to kill me to totally shut us down we're only growing it's
[2:29:16.940 --> 2:29:21.280]  backfiring what are they gonna do that if it's backfiring no then I'm gonna kill
[2:29:21.280 --> 2:29:25.080]  you because then they don't want you dead yet that would make your martyr they're
[2:29:25.080 --> 2:29:29.040]  not that stupid to make somebody a martyr but they are that incompetent to
[2:29:29.040 --> 2:29:35.640]  think that they can put buttons on you on on Riley on the Fox News and on this
[2:29:35.640 --> 2:29:39.200]  other people who were involved and then think that they could put pressure
[2:29:39.200 --> 2:29:44.680]  Trump is not an innocent man he has to grow up he has to focus and he has to be
[2:29:44.680 --> 2:29:48.320]  disciplined in other words there's no longer do a minute or two more on Trump
[2:29:48.320 --> 2:29:53.400]  then we'll go to the next gas in the calls run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[2:30:26.360 --> 2:30:31.040]  in protecting the peace have come in and apparently a total of six antifa
[2:30:31.040 --> 2:30:35.360]  protesters were arrested two for resisting arrest one for a drug
[2:30:35.360 --> 2:30:40.800]  violation and another for possessing a weapon two more arrests were made earlier
[2:30:40.800 --> 2:30:45.560]  in the day for possession of a knife and obstructing an officer and wearing a
[2:30:45.560 --> 2:30:50.280]  mask to evade police despite these arrests the protest remained peaceful and

[2:33:23.560 --> 2:33:28.880]  a dramatic position and I'm not that smart but they the media has made me an
[2:33:28.880 --> 2:33:35.800]  icon by this creature they've created this straw man editing clips out of
[2:33:35.800 --> 2:33:40.160]  context of what I say and do to make me look completely wild or crazy and it's
[2:33:40.160 --> 2:33:44.600]  backfire just like Trump got in despite all his warts we've all got warts none
[2:33:44.600 --> 2:33:50.640]  of us are perfect because the media is so loathed and hated they threw everything
[2:33:50.640 --> 2:33:56.280]  they had at him and the worst they got the more successful he became and it's
[2:33:56.280 --> 2:33:59.680]  the same thing with the pin or myself or anybody that they've indicted the pin
[2:33:59.680 --> 2:34:03.800]  for criticizing Islam they're trying they've tried to kill Nigel Farage three
[2:34:03.800 --> 2:34:07.560]  or four different times the police have said they've tried to kill him not the
[2:34:07.560 --> 2:34:10.820]  police try to kill him the police have confirmed that they've taken his lug

[2:34:57.600 --> 2:35:01.560]  out to anything and then the worst people are in control and whatever their
[2:35:01.560 --> 2:35:05.640]  wild dreams are dictate things so you're in Venezuela you're in North Korea

[2:35:19.800 --> 2:35:23.800]  trade deals and sell out our industry they call that being you know an idiot
[2:35:23.800 --> 2:35:29.600]  or or old-fashioned or you know they sell being a sociopath nowadays as being
[2:35:29.600 --> 2:35:35.080]  smart and expedient and cool no it's called pissing in the pool everybody
[2:35:35.080 --> 2:35:40.520]  does it the pools ruined folks and I'm not a goody tissues I'm not an idiot and
[2:35:40.520 --> 2:35:44.120]  I know Pachinic isn't we're about to go to Roger Stone and then your calls it's
[2:35:44.120 --> 2:35:50.440]  just that Stephen Colbert every night last week and for the two weeks every
[2:35:50.440 --> 2:35:56.360]  night opened his show lying about me with a comedy character very nasty very
[2:35:56.360 --> 2:36:00.760]  mean and they open up all these other shows lying believing they're
[2:36:00.760 --> 2:36:05.120]  psychologically inoculating people to make me a joke but all they're doing is
[2:36:05.120 --> 2:36:08.960]  sending people to find out what's on the show and then they hear Roger Stone or
[2:36:08.960 --> 2:36:13.280]  Steve Pachinic or Ron Paul who's on what Wednesday oh by the way we have a
[2:36:13.280 --> 2:36:18.400]  30-hour broadcast that I should have mentioned the last week with big
[2:36:18.400 --> 2:36:22.920]  discounts big specials and a lot more with a lot of special guest host to help
[2:36:22.920 --> 2:36:27.640]  raise more money for all the attacks and the things they've done to us like
[2:36:27.640 --> 2:36:30.680]  kicking us off Google ads that'll be five million this year we lose sounds a
[2:36:30.680 --> 2:36:33.920]  lot of money that's just the fun things that's a loss just on what we have for
[2:36:33.920 --> 2:36:36.680]  funding we brought in three points something last year was gonna be five
[2:36:36.680 --> 2:36:42.160]  million this year a projected ads going after our sponsors hell taking my
[2:36:42.160 --> 2:36:48.320]  kids away from me you know it's kids really really fun let me tell you to
[2:36:48.320 --> 2:36:52.280]  have it the media all perched there all lying with front page of the paper
[2:36:52.280 --> 2:36:58.200]  openly trying to manipulate the jury just just you name it saying you know
[2:36:58.200 --> 2:37:03.320]  making it a referendum on my speech that's what this has become ladies and
[2:37:03.320 --> 2:37:08.920]  gentlemen and so they pretty much have only energized me that much more to be
[2:37:08.920 --> 2:37:12.800]  more focused and and fight harder but they hate me because I have energy I
[2:37:12.800 --> 2:37:17.360]  have life force and I'm willing to stand up and not roll over and they just want
[2:37:17.360 --> 2:37:21.400]  to intimidate everybody else by crushing me in public they think you're
[2:37:21.400 --> 2:37:24.040]  cowards people used to always accuse me I'm saying this is a closing and let
[2:37:24.040 --> 2:37:27.800]  up its pathetic finish on saying no Trump is not a man without sin no
[2:37:27.800 --> 2:37:33.400]  certainly not not a not a not a piker but we believe he actually wants to
[2:37:33.400 --> 2:37:36.960]  empower the country and the people I always get these questions of your fear
[2:37:36.960 --> 2:37:40.920]  mongering to scare people you must be helping the government scaring people
[2:37:40.920 --> 2:37:45.040]  about how dangerous it is so they don't get involved and I was later told and
[2:37:45.040 --> 2:37:47.720]  told about a decade ago the government actually thought that's what I was doing
[2:37:47.720 --> 2:37:51.600]  on purpose but leave him there he says all the horrible stuff we do and it's
[2:37:51.600 --> 2:37:54.960]  just scares people that are away I thought you were like me you didn't
[2:37:54.960 --> 2:37:59.040]  wouldn't get scared you'd get motivated to do something knowing there's no other
[2:37:59.040 --> 2:38:02.760]  hope but to take action and you know what they miscalculated you were the
[2:38:02.760 --> 2:38:07.080]  people I thought you were you're just like me just like Pachinic anybody else
[2:38:07.080 --> 2:38:10.680]  it's beating in our heart we're not going to be slaves we take it personal
[2:38:10.680 --> 2:38:14.160]  we're not going to be run over and that's what's happening ladies and
[2:38:14.160 --> 2:38:16.760]  gentlemen you take the Armenian genocide I just want to saw that movie the
[2:38:16.760 --> 2:38:20.080]  promise very accurate very powerful three two and a half hours long I
[2:38:20.080 --> 2:38:26.000]  recommend you go see it ladies and gentlemen the only Armenians that live
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:30.040]  were those that fought you know I'm not gonna sit there while they first shut
[2:38:30.040 --> 2:38:33.400]  down the press then they shut down the businesses then they push you into the
[2:38:33.400 --> 2:38:38.240]  hills then they kill you that's what's happening so Pachinic I'm ranting finish
[2:38:38.240 --> 2:38:42.560]  up them are going to of course Roger Stone has got breaking news but they
[2:38:42.560 --> 2:38:46.080]  are they are coming after obviously everybody and the listeners need to know
[2:38:46.080 --> 2:38:50.480]  by coming after myself and others they are coming after everybody because they
[2:38:50.480 --> 2:38:54.400]  fear the populist movement and focal points of it and there is a civil war
[2:38:54.400 --> 2:38:57.200]  inside government as you were saying but just your brief message to Trump
[2:38:57.200 --> 2:39:01.280]  thanks for holding on I broke that down about saying look he's not without you
[2:39:01.280 --> 2:39:07.000]  know sin he needs to grow up go ahead the key here is he's got to get rid of a
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:11.240]  long time he's got to get rid of Jared Kushner if he wants to bring his
[2:39:11.240 --> 2:39:16.400]  family in let him bring in Eric and Donald Jr. that's fine they represented
[2:39:16.400 --> 2:39:21.280]  what we want talked about but let me tell you one statement Hitler always
[2:39:21.280 --> 2:39:28.200]  said to his German public who will ever remember the Armenian genocide 1.3
[2:39:28.200 --> 2:39:33.240]  million Armenians were killed by the Turks with the help of the Germans and
[2:39:33.240 --> 2:39:38.600]  nobody ever remembered the Armenian genocide when the Jews were then rounded
[2:39:38.600 --> 2:39:43.280]  up the Catholics were rounded up the Protestants were rounded up the Lutherans
[2:39:43.280 --> 2:39:50.080]  most people don't remember that the desperation of Catholicism and Lutheran
[2:39:50.080 --> 2:39:55.520] ism started in the 1930s under Hitler he could never have gotten to power if all
[2:39:55.520 --> 2:39:59.400]  the Lutheran priests had been there were ministers or even the Protestants he put
[2:39:59.400 --> 2:40:04.280]  them all in the house they were killed way before the Jews were so I'm not
[2:40:04.280 --> 2:40:09.800]  saying we're in that situation I am saying that America stay alert get you
[2:40:09.800 --> 2:40:15.360]  know be prepared the revolution is not over success is not given you have to
[2:40:15.360 --> 2:40:20.560]  always earn that right to be an American our generals have not really understood
[2:40:20.560 --> 2:40:24.720]  that very well they fought just by going into a battle and wearing a lot of
[2:40:24.720 --> 2:40:28.680]  fruit salad that meant something to people like me and others who didn't
[2:40:28.680 --> 2:40:32.480]  need the uniform who didn't need the fruit salad who didn't need the pension
[2:40:32.480 --> 2:40:37.040]  because we wanted to go out and fail and make ourselves a success in the
[2:40:37.040 --> 2:40:41.800]  American system in the American democracy and not sit on the board of
[2:40:41.800 --> 2:40:48.720]  directors of Northrop Grumman or L3 or SAIC so it's time for us to continue and
[2:40:48.720 --> 2:40:52.600]  start breaking down the military industrial complex and telling our
[2:40:52.600 --> 2:40:57.520]  generals enough is enough we're not sending our boys and girls and others
[2:40:57.520 --> 2:41:02.120]  to war so that they can be killed for your profits that's right and it's part
[2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:05.680]  of the Nuremberg trials that Hitler in 1939 we started going into Poland
[2:41:05.680 --> 2:41:09.160]  Czechoslovakia and other areas starting World War two he said who would
[2:41:09.160 --> 2:41:12.880]  remember the Armenian genocide and the Armenian genocide was used as the model
[2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:17.680]  in 1943 when Hitler started to fail he said just kill all the slave labor Jews
[2:41:17.680 --> 2:41:22.160]  you name it they said look holds were killed Catholics would kill this was not
[2:41:22.160 --> 2:41:26.960]  just Jewish and he said we got away with the Armenian genocide so they're not
[2:41:26.960 --> 2:41:31.080]  gonna care here and that is a perfect example of what we're dealing with so
[2:41:31.080 --> 2:41:34.600]  again when you said Trump's not perfect obviously do you think they've got him
[2:41:34.600 --> 2:41:39.720]  blackmailed I don't know whether they got it I don't rationalize a man who's
[2:41:39.720 --> 2:41:44.480]  empowered he has to explain to me and to the American public what he's gonna do
[2:41:44.480 --> 2:41:49.600]  how he's gonna accomplish that and not become a curial he has to become the
[2:41:49.600 --> 2:41:54.480]  president of the United States which means he has to focus he has to be
[2:41:54.480 --> 2:41:59.360]  disciplined he has to fire people which he can't do I understand from his past
[2:41:59.360 --> 2:42:04.960]  history and he has to be able to stay on course if he can't then we'd be happy
[2:42:04.960 --> 2:42:10.040]  to take I'm replacing with someone else but this can't do dr. Pachennick's
[2:42:10.040 --> 2:42:13.160]  to Pachennick.com gonna talk to you thank you so much thank you Alex and

[2:42:42.840 --> 2:42:47.640]  Supreme Court justice on I'm very thankful to Trump overall but to see him go
[2:42:47.640 --> 2:42:51.840]  from a perfect trajectory to a few degrees off over time a few degrees takes
[2:42:51.840 --> 2:42:55.920]  you back to where you came from turns into a circle pretty soon so he's got
[2:42:55.920 --> 2:42:58.600]  breaking news Roger Stone called us about 30 minutes ago said I want to come
[2:42:58.600 --> 2:43:02.400]  on breaking news stone cold truth.com former head of the Trump campaign you
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:06.360]  can buy his book the making of a president an info or store.com Roger
[2:43:06.360 --> 2:43:09.960]  thank you so much for coming on with us with this breaking info Alex first of all
[2:43:09.960 --> 2:43:15.720]  it's great to see you back in the Sun you know I agree that in the I don't know
[2:43:15.720 --> 2:43:23.160]  38 40 years I've been in politics I've never seen a more focused a negative
[2:43:23.160 --> 2:43:27.560]  assault on any public figure and that would have to include Richard Nixon at
[2:43:27.560 --> 2:43:33.960]  the height of Watergate than this media assault on you that is incredibly
[2:43:33.960 --> 2:43:38.880]  multidimensional in other words in the entertainment realm they're gutting you
[2:43:38.880 --> 2:43:45.680]  by by you know a parody of you and where they play with our algorithms and
[2:43:45.680 --> 2:43:50.960]  manipulate through their fake news blockers and snopes and others they
[2:43:50.960 --> 2:43:56.880]  seek to strangle our message so I you know first let me say I've got your
[2:43:56.880 --> 2:44:01.760]  back in this fight this is going to be the greatest fight as we go forward
[2:44:01.760 --> 2:44:07.240]  because the way they destroy us as you know is to kill our first amendment
[2:44:07.240 --> 2:44:13.400]  rights take away our platform and to end a free press in America as we know you
[2:44:13.400 --> 2:44:15.520]  know it's important you say that because I always get caught up in the news don't
[2:44:15.520 --> 2:44:19.240]  explain it that you know we're the beta test that they're kicked you off ad role
[2:44:19.240 --> 2:44:22.480]  they kicked you off Google they're doing all the same stuff to you that there's a
[2:44:22.480 --> 2:44:26.520]  long list of us they have co-bearant others attack us every night with lies
[2:44:26.520 --> 2:44:32.360]  all the major news channels CBS ABC NBC saying Alex said he's a fake Alex said
[2:44:32.360 --> 2:44:36.760]  he's a racist he's a cult leader he lost his kids on and on and on total
[2:44:36.760 --> 2:44:41.880]  concerted assault on every front and when you pull back and look at it then
[2:44:41.880 --> 2:44:46.360]  they're strangling us blocking us not even having us on the shows not having
[2:44:46.360 --> 2:44:49.600]  us in Congress when they call us Russian agents with no proof so they're
[2:44:49.600 --> 2:44:53.720]  blocking us on our own platforms while not letting us respond I mean it is
[2:44:53.720 --> 2:44:59.200]  unprecedented well but let me just say that if you sit back and look at it I
[2:44:59.200 --> 2:45:04.520]  would remind you of a line that they actually show in this trailer forget me
[2:45:04.520 --> 2:45:09.640]  Roger Stone Alex they would not hate you if you were not effective the reason
[2:45:09.640 --> 2:45:14.080]  why they take gotta take you out and infowars out is because you have been
[2:45:14.080 --> 2:45:20.880]  indeed the tip of the spear and you have provided a platform for the truth to so
[2:45:20.880 --> 2:45:25.720]  many others in including those who work with you right there you know in the
[2:45:25.720 --> 2:45:29.960]  info let's be clear we then produce the Americana truth-based talking points
[2:45:29.960 --> 2:45:35.040]  that takeover talk radio takeover Fox they now know where it's not just us but
[2:45:35.040 --> 2:45:39.520]  yes we've who they've chosen to destroy so hopeless understand when they buy the
[2:45:39.520 --> 2:45:42.640]  products when they spread the links when they thank the local stations for
[2:45:42.640 --> 2:45:46.240]  carrying us it is an act of total resistance Roger I think they're going
[2:45:46.240 --> 2:45:50.920]  to fail what do you think no I think so also just the fact there Alex that they
[2:45:50.920 --> 2:45:56.440]  parody you it's a homage it's a homage to your effectiveness as one of the
[2:45:56.440 --> 2:46:00.840]  leaders in this fight and look I think if you look across the board it's people
[2:46:00.840 --> 2:46:04.480]  like Mike Cernovich and the folks at Breitbart and the folks at the Daily
[2:46:04.480 --> 2:46:09.600]  Caller and the folks at at the info wars and the folks at Town Hall and so many
[2:46:09.600 --> 2:46:14.800]  other great alternative sites that are committed to the truth where there's
[2:46:14.800 --> 2:46:20.400]  better investigative journaling than you can see at CNN by the way heartening to
[2:46:20.400 --> 2:46:27.280]  see people chanting at the Trump rally CNN sucks CNN sucks and having CNN have
[2:46:27.280 --> 2:46:32.800]  it on air for a snippet really refreshing absolutely well my friend what
[2:46:32.800 --> 2:46:37.440]  is the big breaking news today well I can now tell you authoritatively Alex that
[2:46:37.440 --> 2:46:44.480]  the president has been informed of the coming resignation of Supreme Court
[2:46:44.480 --> 2:46:53.560]  Justice Anthony Kennedy through a back channel this sets off a furious campaign
[2:46:53.560 --> 2:47:02.520]  now to place the next Supreme Court justice the front-runner is that and
[2:47:02.520 --> 2:47:07.800]  that sweepstake is clearly Judge Neil Hardigan from the Western District of
[2:47:07.800 --> 2:47:15.680]  Pennsylvania now Hardigan was thought to be the runner-up when Judge Gorsuch was
[2:47:15.680 --> 2:47:19.280]  selected and it's also known to be the personal
[2:47:19.280 --> 2:47:25.440]  fragment of Marianne Trump Barry the esteemed rated appointee to the bench
[2:47:25.440 --> 2:47:33.280]  in New Jersey he is a conservative not necessarily a libertarian a conservative
[2:47:33.280 --> 2:47:37.560]  so you're giving us the exclusive this hasn't broken yet this this has not
[2:47:37.560 --> 2:47:44.800]  broken yet let me continue if I may and say that senator Charles Grassley has his
[2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:51.760]  own candidate who is not Judge Hardigan for this slot and has made the White
[2:47:51.760 --> 2:47:59.680]  House very aware of his position remember that Grassley's assistance would
[2:47:59.680 --> 2:48:06.000]  be required to get the nominee through the Senate but the big news is it is that
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:10.600]  the Justice Kennedy is stepping down I think that's the news but I also think
[2:48:10.600 --> 2:48:14.800]  a quick handicap is crucial here hard to get in the front-runner Grassley with
[2:48:14.800 --> 2:48:19.680]  his own candidate that we will identify here at Info Wars perhaps that when we
[2:48:19.680 --> 2:48:23.480]  get together and then of course the dark horse in this and this is very
[2:48:23.480 --> 2:48:29.200]  important Judge Andrew Napolitano now what's not known Alex is whether the
[2:48:29.200 --> 2:48:34.320]  president is going to go to the list that he released in the election he only
[2:48:34.320 --> 2:48:39.960]  said that he would choose his first justice from that list and indeed he
[2:48:39.960 --> 2:48:45.280]  did if the list were were out the window and he had a broader selection
[2:48:45.280 --> 2:48:51.720]  Hardigan was on the list Grassley's candidate was not a judge on the list
[2:48:51.720 --> 2:48:57.600]  and of course judge Napolitano is the outside the box theory but known to be
[2:48:57.600 --> 2:49:02.440]  a personal favorite of the president himself well a little bird told me and
[2:49:02.440 --> 2:49:06.920]  I checked with another bird that Trump promised to go off the list for the
[2:49:06.920 --> 2:49:11.040]  first one but said on the second one he was leaning towards Napolitano was that
[2:49:11.040 --> 2:49:15.200]  accurate I heard that too I think what he said was he was learning towards
[2:49:15.200 --> 2:49:20.600]  a more he was leaning towards a more libertarian or oriented choice and we
[2:49:20.600 --> 2:49:24.880]  know that he's fond of the judge so that's at a minimum well Napolitano is
[2:49:24.880 --> 2:49:27.640]  so incredibly smart he's got the background they put a lot of big state
[2:49:27.640 --> 2:49:31.520]  judges in the Supreme Court before it would energize Trump's base I mean you
[2:49:31.520 --> 2:49:36.560]  talk about a death blow Judge Andrew Napolitano on the Supreme Court man
[2:49:36.560 --> 2:49:42.080]  pardon me the you're absolutely right look Felix Frankfurter was a state
[2:49:42.080 --> 2:49:47.280]  jurist I believe before going to the bench one of the greatest Supreme Court
[2:49:47.280 --> 2:49:54.280]  justices so this is going to cause a ripple in official Washington the
[2:49:54.280 --> 2:49:59.840]  president clearly as I said earlier has been told that the the letter from
[2:49:59.840 --> 2:50:06.280]  Justice Kennedy is supposedly imminent all right we're gonna get a transcript of
[2:50:06.280 --> 2:50:10.880]  this out right now Roger Stone the president has been told that the letter
[2:50:10.880 --> 2:50:15.160]  is imminent of Justice Kennedy's resignation let's put that we're out
[2:50:15.160 --> 2:50:19.720]  right now get this snipped out this last five minutes and put up on YouTube and
[2:50:19.720 --> 2:50:22.960]  Facebook as soon as possible and of course you've given us so many big
[2:50:22.960 --> 2:50:26.480]  exclusives I guess this will be one more fake news story like Cernovich
[2:50:26.480 --> 2:50:31.040]  getting it directly from the White House that it was Susan Rice that did the
[2:50:31.040 --> 2:50:36.680]  leaking well I always say this now that we had made this public is imminent in
[2:50:36.680 --> 2:50:41.920]  Washington time a week two weeks three months a month but this is surely
[2:50:41.920 --> 2:50:47.240]  coming this retirement once we expose the politics of it obviously liberals
[2:50:47.240 --> 2:50:53.320]  will urge Kennedy to hang on not wanting to end President Trump yet another
[2:50:53.320 --> 2:50:56.320]  seat sure sure well the statesman's asking is he getting ready you say the
[2:50:56.320 --> 2:51:00.760]  word is he is in these uncertain times it makes sense to have a sustainable

[2:56:06.200 --> 2:56:12.040]  really think that this attack on you really needs to be seen in the in the
[2:56:12.040 --> 2:56:17.280]  right context it's not about Alex Jones it's about your effectiveness in terms
[2:56:17.280 --> 2:56:22.760]  of the movement it's gonna pack on us everybody I mean if you saw the charts
[2:56:22.760 --> 2:56:28.960]  of our retweets from October and January and today at stone cold truths at
[2:56:28.960 --> 2:56:35.640]  stonezone.com which is being reinvented before our very eyes if you saw the way
[2:56:35.640 --> 2:56:42.160]  our Twitter feed our Facebook feeds are being manipulated to limit our reach to
[2:56:42.160 --> 2:56:47.240]  patriots it's the slow-motion strangulation and it will either have
[2:56:47.240 --> 2:56:53.120]  to be solved in an anti-trust action by the Trump Justice Department although
[2:56:53.120 --> 2:56:58.680]  today there is no particular indication that the White House is where the
[2:56:58.680 --> 2:57:04.480]  gravity of this threat or a class action suit which could be long and expensive
[2:57:04.480 --> 2:57:09.800]  and difficult but the American people are not going to let the toothpaste be put
[2:57:09.800 --> 2:57:13.360]  back in the tube when it comes to the First Amendment and our right to
[2:57:13.360 --> 2:57:21.120]  communicate it is it's felonistic in its in its scope on Wednesday here at
[2:57:21.120 --> 2:57:27.960]  Info Wars I'm going to be with Jacob Engels who has broken some major stories
[2:57:27.960 --> 2:57:36.000]  exposing pro-Islamic activities in the academic world and in government Soros
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  has now been caught funding local candidates and the Soros organization
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:45.880]  had threatened Engels and independent journalists we're gonna have him talking
[2:57:45.880 --> 2:57:50.680]  about how suddenly after he broke these stories Alex his Twitter feed his
[2:57:50.680 --> 2:57:57.040]  Facebook we feed the the all of the basic net contacts for his investigative
[2:57:57.040 --> 2:58:01.400]  journey oh yeah oh yeah Soros last year was in the WikiLeaks saying once the UN

[2:58:04.800 --> 2:58:08.920]  control the news this guy is incredible so it's not just me they're going after
[2:58:08.920 --> 2:58:15.200]  everybody in live time there it's George Soros is he was the first client that
[2:58:15.200 --> 2:58:19.160]  founded the law firm that's suing me and the guy suing me's on the Federal
[2:58:19.160 --> 2:58:22.920]  Reserve Board of New York I mean can you imagine how crazy they are to do that

[2:59:02.800 --> 2:59:07.640]  system but right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything

[2:59:55.360 --> 3:00:17.360]  the world is a dangerous place not because of evil but because of those who
[3:00:17.360 --> 3:00:24.160]  look on and do nothing from the front lines of the information war it's Alex
[3:00:24.160 --> 3:00:29.320]  Jones all right let's go to a Roku viewer Bido and Iowa thanks for holding so
[3:00:29.320 --> 3:00:34.520]  long I just wanted to get to you though go ahead Bido thank you mr. Jones I
[3:00:34.520 --> 3:00:38.200]  appreciate you taking my call the hundred days of Donald Trump I think
[3:00:38.200 --> 3:00:41.440]  they've actually been pretty good I mean yeah during the administration we've
[3:00:41.440 --> 3:00:46.000]  had well decades I mean you look through TPP the freeze on non-military federal
[3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:49.880]  employees I mean the low numbers across cutting the UN by half all of it is
[3:00:49.880 --> 3:00:52.960]  pretty good yeah but I mean starting war with Russia for no reason doesn't look
[3:00:52.960 --> 3:00:56.800]  too good though oh yeah I mean even the like that was what I want to bring up
[3:00:56.800 --> 3:01:02.520]  the criticism of him doing a size NATO Russia I would like to repeal Obamacare
[3:01:02.520 --> 3:01:06.840]  instead of replacing it and then the take down a Flynn and then ban and being
[3:01:06.840 --> 3:01:10.240]  pushed back I don't I mean my buddy and I have a podcast every week so we try to
[3:01:10.240 --> 3:01:13.800]  really figure out what's going on I think it's the people that are
[3:01:13.800 --> 3:01:18.160]  surrounding Trump and trying to you know be nice to him like you know Kushner I
[3:01:18.160 --> 3:01:21.360]  think is someone we have to look at I'm not yeah do you think Kushner's just
[3:01:21.360 --> 3:01:26.040]  intimidated by all the pressure do you think he's an operative well Pat
[3:01:26.040 --> 3:01:30.600]  dollar comm came out and says that George Soros put 258 million dollars into
[3:01:30.600 --> 3:01:34.480]  him and actually that was in the Washington Post in the New York Times he
[3:01:34.480 --> 3:01:39.360]  actually did get George Soros funding about three years ago yeah and then you
[3:01:39.360 --> 3:01:43.480]  put the New York Times article with the Steinman family and then the Communist
[3:01:43.480 --> 3:01:47.160]  Chinese you know why he invested all that in that 666 building Kushner's doing
[3:01:47.160 --> 3:01:51.120]  horrible management's gonna lose it so the reason you know that's what that's
[3:01:51.120 --> 3:01:55.200]  what Soros goes and invest in things he thinks are gonna go belly up I don't
[3:01:55.200 --> 3:01:58.640]  know that shows he's working for Soros it just shows that he's beholden to
[3:01:58.640 --> 3:02:03.800]  Soros though yes they're just it's business it's what's from the Godfathers
[3:02:03.800 --> 3:02:08.480]  not personal it's just business and they're a bunch of sociopaths it's
[3:02:08.480 --> 3:02:13.080]  gotta stop veto thank you so much I agree with you we're probably about to
[3:02:13.080 --> 3:02:16.360]  see another good Supreme Court justice I mean thank God Trump's there it's just
[3:02:16.360 --> 3:02:20.280]  sad that he's not as pure as we wished I mean we would have had Hillary Clinton
[3:02:20.280 --> 3:02:23.520]  but I wish you do something about the Internet censorship and go after Google
[3:02:23.520 --> 3:02:29.480]  let's talk to Jessica in Michigan Jessica thanks for holding hey Alex I've
[3:02:29.480 --> 3:02:35.000]  been an info warrior for 2005 and our family is praying for yours just want to
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:39.640]  say that thank you I've been on a paleo ketogenic diet for over a year now and
[3:02:39.640 --> 3:02:44.720]  I've been an avid user of bone broth I just received caveman this week and
[3:02:44.720 --> 3:02:51.040]  wow that is out of this world it oh next level so to be clear you already into
[3:02:51.040 --> 3:02:54.960]  bone broth and all it's great attributes that are known but but I mean then how
[3:02:54.960 --> 3:02:59.640]  would you compare other bone broths you've had to caveman I thought I had
[3:02:59.640 --> 3:03:03.640]  the best actually I had tried so many different brands I thought I had the best
[3:03:03.640 --> 3:03:10.640]  and I could literally feel the effects within about 20 minutes or so and my
[3:03:10.640 --> 3:03:14.920]  significant other same thing I I just said hey you got to try this is
[3:03:14.920 --> 3:03:20.840]  incredible we literally keep it in our coffee container now so I was about to
[3:03:20.840 --> 3:03:24.040]  say Buckley drinks it with coffee I don't like it that way I like it with
[3:03:24.040 --> 3:03:28.440]  milk a little bit of ice cubes as like a shake my children love it there's so
[3:03:28.440 --> 3:03:32.640]  much I mean even more glowing with it so thank you for the support we set out
[3:03:32.640 --> 3:03:36.920]  with a big national organic manufacturer to create the Rolls Royce at an
[3:03:36.920 --> 3:03:40.440]  affordable price so I'm glad you like it because it really is an amazing formula
[3:03:40.440 --> 3:03:44.800]  it is too and and thank you for the stickers I put them on my car I have
[3:03:44.800 --> 3:03:48.560]  Trump stickers on my car too and this is another thing I want to tell you there's
[3:03:48.560 --> 3:03:51.960]  no one around here I'm in southeast Michigan about 20 minutes from Detroit
[3:03:51.960 --> 3:03:56.320]  on my North at Detroit people are way too afraid to have them on their car and I
[3:03:56.320 --> 3:04:01.200]  got this fire in my spirit just like you and I got them on my car and I actually
[3:04:01.200 --> 3:04:05.680]  had a cop pull me over my birthday is in April and I figured it was from our eggs
[3:04:05.680 --> 3:04:09.680]  and you just wanted to give me a friendly reminder but he also wanted to
[3:04:09.680 --> 3:04:13.040]  make sure no one was messing with me because nobody has stickers on their
[3:04:13.040 --> 3:04:17.120]  cars around here and he thanked me for the support and you know it's just
[3:04:17.120 --> 3:04:22.360]  crazy that he wants to make sure I'm safe that I have a sticker on my car that
[3:04:22.360 --> 3:04:27.560]  says I support President Trump what day and age are we living in when I got a
[3:04:27.560 --> 3:04:31.200]  sticker that says I support our president and I got to be worried about my
[3:04:31.200 --> 3:04:36.800]  safety it shows what bullies they are believe me ma'am I know they have come
[3:04:36.800 --> 3:04:42.040]  after me bad they have they have certainly gotten their licks in and it's
[3:04:42.040 --> 3:04:45.280]  getting more intense every week and it's gonna be a test I actually look
[3:04:45.280 --> 3:04:49.040]  forward to it you know we'll see if my medals as strong as I claim it is

[3:05:28.360 --> 3:05:33.240]  apparently a total of six antifa protesters were arrested two for
[3:05:33.240 --> 3:05:37.720]  resisting arrest one for a drug violation and another for possessing a
[3:05:37.720 --> 3:05:42.640]  weapon two more arrests were made earlier in the day for possession of a knife
[3:05:42.640 --> 3:05:47.920]  and obstructing an officer and wearing a mask to evade police despite these
[3:05:47.920 --> 3:05:52.520]  arrests the protest remained peaceful and dialogue between both sides was

[3:08:29.760 --> 3:08:34.760]  satanic holiday across the world that's a historic fact the media probably make
[3:08:34.760 --> 3:08:40.960]  jokes about it say Jones says May Day satanic the fact the satanic holiday in
[3:08:40.960 --> 3:08:46.960]  France the Jacobins the devil worship party killed over a million people in
[3:08:46.960 --> 3:08:50.600]  the French Revolution they're the model of communism the red terror this is
[3:08:50.600 --> 3:08:56.600]  their day this is their time and they're burning and killing and stabbing all
[3:08:56.600 --> 3:09:00.080]  over the world and calling for North Korea calling for communist China
[3:09:00.080 --> 3:09:04.160]  calling for Venezuela calling for the wonderland this collectivism I'm taking
[3:09:04.160 --> 3:09:07.040]  a few final calls and calls for a little while with David Knight that he's taken
[3:09:07.040 --> 3:09:11.640]  over at the start of the next segment I wanted to talk to Dean and skit skits is
[3:09:11.640 --> 3:09:17.800]  up next and then Bubba and Dan but I gotta tell you David I don't make it
[3:09:17.800 --> 3:09:21.440]  about us but notice all these other guests everybody else are every comedy
[3:09:21.440 --> 3:09:25.560]  show every nightly news show yeah everywhere even before the whole custody
[3:09:25.560 --> 3:09:30.320]  battle and all that distortion that the media engaged in it has been the
[3:09:30.320 --> 3:09:37.160]  craziest attack that I have ever seen in my life it has been the most distorted
[3:09:37.160 --> 3:09:42.520]  the most insane the most crazy thing and it's it's beyond media it's beyond
[3:09:42.520 --> 3:09:46.720]  them trying to censor us online and block us going after sponsors it's
[3:09:46.720 --> 3:09:50.480]  beyond the national media demonizing us saying we're fake saying we said we're
[3:09:50.480 --> 3:09:55.720]  fake we never said it it's spiritual where then like people you've been around
[3:09:55.720 --> 3:09:59.840]  for years suddenly like agent Smith jumping into another body it's like
[3:09:59.840 --> 3:10:05.400]  people just activate and come at you because they're like signaled by it
[3:10:05.400 --> 3:10:09.520]  yeah and believe that you're falling so they want to pile on like when a crab
[3:10:09.520 --> 3:10:13.200]  tries to climb out of a of a bucket of crabs they don't attack other crabs they
[3:10:13.200 --> 3:10:17.520]  try to leave meanwhile we're actually getting stronger so I wonder as they
[3:10:17.520 --> 3:10:20.840]  intensify the attack for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction
[3:10:20.840 --> 3:10:26.400]  Newtonian physics as they attack us we get more audience more people more
[3:10:26.400 --> 3:10:32.840]  support but it is just like neck and neck what happens if people double down by
[3:10:32.840 --> 3:10:36.320]  the product spread the video spread it by email tell people word of mouth by
[3:10:36.320 --> 3:10:43.880]  info wars.com the forbidden information I mean it's just it's just crazy to see
[3:10:43.880 --> 3:10:47.120]  the Federal Reserve board member attacking us George Soros law firm
[3:10:47.120 --> 3:10:51.600]  suing us I mean it is it is amazing we know Alex one of the things that you
[3:10:51.600 --> 3:10:55.440]  know really gets me upset is imminent domain I hate to see the government
[3:10:55.440 --> 3:10:58.280]  come in and steal people's ranches steal their mining business steal their
[3:10:58.280 --> 3:11:04.480]  lumber and I hate to see somebody come from another country and get subsidized
[3:11:04.480 --> 3:11:08.800]  by US taxpayers and that's what's happening here how did this guy get so
[3:11:08.800 --> 3:11:12.920]  much money how did he get so many subsidies and subsidized factories and
[3:11:12.920 --> 3:11:16.600]  subsidized workers are trained for him at community colleges and of course it's
[3:11:16.600 --> 3:11:19.880]  because of his political connections that's what people need to get upset the
[3:11:19.880 --> 3:11:23.440]  same model as Gulan same thing as the Gulan schools hundreds of billions of
[3:11:23.440 --> 3:11:27.800]  dollars US money yeah yeah 500 million dollars a year when I did the report a
[3:11:27.800 --> 3:11:31.520]  couple years ago and of course they're growing schools and this network here in
[3:11:31.520 --> 3:11:37.480]  America all the time and here in America it's secular but they push his
[3:11:37.480 --> 3:11:41.040]  Turkish connections a great deal so what is it about all of this I mean we we
[3:11:41.040 --> 3:11:44.600]  understand the involvement of the Saudis and I've got a report here I want to
[3:11:44.600 --> 3:11:48.360]  talk about the Handmaid's Tale you know that story that Margaret Atwood did
[3:11:48.360 --> 3:11:52.960]  about this horrific Christian patriarchy that takes over the country I'm adding to
[3:11:52.960 --> 3:11:56.680]  a film with Robert DeVall that's right yeah actually my wife was an extra in
[3:11:56.680 --> 3:12:00.840]  that Alex wow we ought to play we ought to review that in fact that the icon the
[3:12:00.840 --> 3:12:04.680]  TV is the all-seeing eye yeah but really that should have been about Islam yeah
[3:12:04.680 --> 3:12:09.600]  exactly and that's the point this is all happening at the same time that they're
[3:12:09.600 --> 3:12:15.120]  making Saudi Arabia part of the UN commission on women's rights I mean you
[3:12:15.120 --> 3:12:18.360]  can't they're already on the human rights commission right now it's women's
[3:12:18.360 --> 3:12:21.920]  rights and you see over the weekend leftist worldwide war had jibs and
[3:12:21.920 --> 3:12:26.500]  solidarity yeah yeah and yet women having to cover their faces is the new
[3:12:26.500 --> 3:12:31.600]  feminism and the West that empowered women yeah and the West were the goddess
[3:12:31.600 --> 3:12:36.960]  I'm a Christian but you know it was worshiped is now the enemy and if you
[3:12:36.960 --> 3:12:40.280]  look at these pictures of these women who are being subjugated in the Handmaid's
[3:12:40.280 --> 3:12:43.640]  Tale okay they're made to wear these costumes and so forth and yet their
[3:12:43.640 --> 3:12:47.760]  faces are exposed I mean these are people that would be identified in Saudi
[3:12:47.760 --> 3:12:53.120]  Arabia as heretics as heretic horse okay that infidel horse that's what they
[3:12:53.120 --> 3:12:56.480]  would be calling them and all the things that they're talking about in this
[3:12:56.480 --> 3:13:00.440]  dystopian novel are going on right now and yet they're saying this is the
[3:13:00.440 --> 3:13:04.640]  reality of Trump's America no it's not it's the reality of our allies in Saudi
[3:13:04.640 --> 3:13:08.960]  Arabia but nobody will say that because of their political connections they have
[3:13:08.960 --> 3:13:14.640]  so many connections into our monetary system and of course you're on fire
[3:13:14.640 --> 3:13:18.840]  the globalist or the cultist they want to destroy Christianity yeah that's why
[3:13:18.840 --> 3:13:23.400]  the ally with Islam anything they want to destroy Christianity and George
[3:13:23.400 --> 3:13:27.040]  Charles is in the WikiLeaks saying he wants to destroy Israel that's right
[3:13:27.040 --> 3:13:32.400]  and so the ADL says here's more money what does that tell you oh yeah yeah
[3:13:32.400 --> 3:13:36.040]  exactly this this is when we look at what's going on as you point out we
[3:13:36.040 --> 3:13:39.360]  welcome this investigation because we did the reports on this we've talked
[3:13:39.360 --> 3:13:44.840]  about this in the past how does this kind of stuff happen and and and yet we
[3:13:44.840 --> 3:13:50.000]  can't get anybody to pay any attention to how come a guy who won't say that he's
[3:13:50.000 --> 3:13:54.000]  not still a Turkish citizen how can how does he get on the New York Fed how does
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:57.440]  he get on the Federal Reserve Board the one that makes all the policy is
[3:13:57.440 --> 3:14:01.400]  absolutely amazing and this story just gave me about Jerome Corsi this is
[3:14:01.400 --> 3:14:04.640]  something again we have talked about over and over by the way this guy's a
[3:14:04.640 --> 3:14:09.920]  total public figure and he says oh my yogurt company doesn't bring in people
[3:14:09.920 --> 3:14:13.520]  well of course they don't technically but then he's pushing the refugees they're
[3:14:13.520 --> 3:14:16.520]  unvetted he can't just blame it on the State Department but there's the
[3:14:16.520 --> 3:14:20.040]  headlines the Wall Street Journal everywhere Bloomberg Jones sued for
[3:14:20.040 --> 3:14:24.240]  linking refugees to rape well what the hell do you think's happening in Europe
[3:14:24.240 --> 3:14:28.160]  they arrest you for it so the whole point of that report that I that I did
[3:14:28.160 --> 3:14:31.580]  when I did that was because we're also being it's your report we're being
[3:14:31.580 --> 3:14:37.280]  sued for in the headline which is and what's crazier is David they were being
[3:14:37.280 --> 3:14:41.680]  sued for saying that the Islamists is coming in increased TB it did increase
[3:14:41.680 --> 3:14:46.000]  in the town 500% that's right I mean it's it's admitted so this is just pure
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:48.880]  intimidation but let me ask you this I've talked to five top lawyers we've
[3:14:48.880 --> 3:14:52.960]  engaged two of them guys that have gone up against these grips before people
[3:14:52.960 --> 3:14:56.440]  represent the Boston Herald when the Islamists sued them a few years ago and
[3:14:56.440 --> 3:15:01.200]  they said no it's a pure publicity stunt this is a very bad case so what are they
[3:15:01.200 --> 3:15:05.240]  even thinking is it just to say I'm fake I'm fake and hopefully get other
[3:15:05.240 --> 3:15:07.880]  people to sue me I mean what is it I think they're gonna get some very bad
[3:15:07.880 --> 3:15:11.200]  publicity out of this because they don't want people to know what's really
[3:15:11.200 --> 3:15:14.800]  going on and that was the point of my report I said look we had these
[3:15:14.800 --> 3:15:18.240]  situations are a lot of concern about so many refugees coming into the small
[3:15:18.240 --> 3:15:22.080]  town in Idaho and when this and the media covered up a year ago that they're
[3:15:22.080 --> 3:15:25.000]  worthy assaults now they pled guilty that's right they said it was fake news
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:29.040]  the longest time and then at the end of the week they came in they closed the
[3:15:29.040 --> 3:15:32.000]  case they said all right they've pled guilty and within a couple of days 60
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:35.280]  minutes does a puff piece on them doesn't mention the negative consequences
[3:15:35.280 --> 3:15:38.600]  or concerns about negative consequences whatsoever so it simply makes it all
[3:15:38.600 --> 3:15:42.320]  about the jobs that he created he says hey when I bring somebody into this
[3:15:42.320 --> 3:15:44.960]  country and I give them a job they're no longer a refugee well you know why
[3:15:44.960 --> 3:15:49.680]  aren't you trying to stop the wars in those countries we got seven countries
[3:15:49.680 --> 3:15:52.940]  the seven same seven countries that Donald Trump said we're going to do
[3:15:52.940 --> 3:15:56.280]  extreme vetting on those are countries we're at war with we're bombing the
[3:15:56.280 --> 3:15:59.720]  people there where is the left why don't they want to talk about stopping the
[3:15:59.720 --> 3:16:04.600]  war there for humanitarian oh exactly oh I said Sandy Hook made me fake I hurt
[3:16:04.600 --> 3:16:07.840]  children I don't care that's not true there are ones launching wars that kill
[3:16:07.840 --> 3:16:11.240]  millions the scarf hundreds of thousands of death they have blood all over them
[3:16:11.240 --> 3:16:15.200]  let's go to a call here skits you're on the air from Nebraska thanks for being a
[3:16:15.200 --> 3:16:20.720]  trooper you're on the air worldwide listening on shortwave thank you sir
[3:16:20.720 --> 3:16:26.760]  President Trump I started getting worried when that secret service agent
[3:16:26.760 --> 3:16:32.000]  happened to leave their computer in the car and the computer got stolen yes all
[3:16:32.000 --> 3:16:38.240]  the okay so I think mr. Trump they've got some kind of a hold on him because the
[3:16:38.240 --> 3:16:42.640]  moves that he's making were not the moves that I voted for what I think he
[3:16:42.640 --> 3:16:48.400]  needs to do is number one give Jared Kushner and his daughter
[3:16:48.400 --> 3:16:54.200]  unfortunately a bonka the boot although I think before he does he should give
[3:16:54.200 --> 3:16:58.240]  it give his daughter a copy of the Declaration of Independence and the
[3:16:58.240 --> 3:17:04.280]  Constitutionist study and maybe she'll know what's going on bring back Steve
[3:17:04.280 --> 3:17:09.360]  Bannon bring back Flynn get rid of my master who was a Hillary supporter
[3:17:09.360 --> 3:17:15.080]  instead of look how they're claiming Flynn's a Russian agent because he got
[3:17:15.080 --> 3:17:19.040]  paid to go speak at a TV event in Russia yeah again you're not allowed to have any
[3:17:19.040 --> 3:17:22.440]  contact with Russia or your spy the biggest problem with Flynn was that he
[3:17:22.440 --> 3:17:26.800]  said the words radical Islamic terror and of course when he was replaced the
[3:17:26.800 --> 3:17:30.520]  first thing the very first meeting that McMaster had his replacement said we're
[3:17:30.520 --> 3:17:34.440]  not going to use that term absolutely David's gonna be taken over here in a

[3:24:11.440 --> 3:24:14.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and this fourth hour we're
[3:24:14.680 --> 3:24:19.320]  gonna go back to our callers here in just a moment to give you a preview of
[3:24:19.320 --> 3:24:22.560]  what's coming up we're gonna talk a little bit about Mayday what's behind
[3:24:22.560 --> 3:24:27.200]  that but also the poster child for communism that we see today troubled
[3:24:27.200 --> 3:24:30.600]  Venezuela and we're gonna tell you that's not an aberration of course you'll
[3:24:30.600 --> 3:24:34.120]  hear that every time we talk about Venezuela I always get comments from
[3:24:34.120 --> 3:24:37.640]  the socialists trolling us on YouTube saying that's not typical that's not
[3:24:37.640 --> 3:24:42.840]  typical we want to talk about socialism talk about Sweden now actually Sweden is
[3:24:42.840 --> 3:24:46.520]  gonna get there they're on their way they're just moving at a very slow pace
[3:24:46.520 --> 3:24:50.680]  and they had much further to fall before they get to the point of Venezuela
[3:24:50.680 --> 3:24:56.000]  now Venezuela is now where all of these dictatorships these kleptocracies are
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:24:58.440]  eventually going to wind up so we're gonna talk a little bit about Venezuela
[3:24:58.440 --> 3:25:02.440]  today we're also gonna talk about as I point out the Handmaid's Tale this is
[3:25:02.440 --> 3:25:07.560]  the story that was released by Hulu they refilmed this my wife was in the 1990
[3:25:07.560 --> 3:25:12.640]  version as a extra very small part in it just crowd scenes and stuff and of
[3:25:12.640 --> 3:25:17.160]  course they treated her pretty poorly I don't think she went back after the
[3:25:17.160 --> 3:25:21.040]  first day and she was horrified horrified to find out what this movie was
[3:25:21.040 --> 3:25:25.920]  about she didn't know anything about this it's kind of like having Phyllis
[3:25:25.920 --> 3:25:30.720]  Schlafly finding out that she was an extra in Warren Beatty's Reds my wife is
[3:25:30.720 --> 3:25:34.280]  so adamantly opposed to everything and all these lies and the Handmaid's Tale
[3:25:34.280 --> 3:25:38.040]  so we're gonna talk about the Handmaid's Burka because that's really what this is
[3:25:38.040 --> 3:25:41.920]  truly about it is everything that they're saying in the Handmaid's Trail
[3:25:41.920 --> 3:25:46.600]  there's this dystopia that's there it is far worse than that now in Saudi
[3:25:46.600 --> 3:25:51.280]  Arabia but they cannot bring themselves to say that it is simply about the evil
[3:25:51.280 --> 3:25:55.200]  of America the evil of American patriarchy the evil of American
[3:25:55.200 --> 3:26:00.560]  Christianity that's what this tale is about and we're gonna show you an op-ed
[3:26:00.560 --> 3:26:05.160]  piece from someone who was writing for Salon who talks about how she punked her
[3:26:05.160 --> 3:26:11.560]  class and how it was so necessary to study this how she did a fake book
[3:26:11.560 --> 3:26:15.440]  banning in her class but you know this is this is what this is all about let's
[3:26:15.440 --> 3:26:18.520]  go back to our callers here and let's try to get this board cleared off the
[3:26:18.520 --> 3:26:24.000]  people have been waiting here let's go to Jeff in Arizona Jeff go ahead David
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:31.600]  yes go ahead hey listen I just I've been I've been a long time listener to your
[3:26:31.600 --> 3:26:35.400]  show been paying attention to everything Alex has been saying ever since the
[3:26:35.400 --> 3:26:41.000]  Obama deception came out it's been very eye-opening and I know Alex
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:46.480]  constantly says things like you know don't thank me or well I wanted to thank
[3:26:46.480 --> 3:26:52.320]  all the hard work you guys do anyway I just wanted to say that this whole thing
[3:26:52.320 --> 3:26:57.160]  with Julian Assange I'm very confused by it Trump seems to be on top of a lot of
[3:26:57.160 --> 3:27:04.920]  things a lot of domestic things to protect our country but well I think if
[3:27:04.920 --> 3:27:09.800]  you look at what's going on with this of course we got an article up on info
[3:27:09.800 --> 3:27:14.400]  wars about it talking about how this vault seven for example severely
[3:27:14.400 --> 3:27:20.840]  embarrassed the CIA and so I think that that's really what's behind this and of
[3:27:20.840 --> 3:27:27.160]  course it's the bureaucracy there the CIA is coming after him as well and so
[3:27:27.160 --> 3:27:32.720]  it's something that we need to speak out about I don't think that we need to say
[3:27:32.720 --> 3:27:37.360]  now that Julian Assange is a bad guy but of course Trump during the campaign
[3:27:37.360 --> 3:27:41.000]  was saying that Ed Snowden was a traitor I don't think Ed Snowden was a
[3:27:41.000 --> 3:27:44.600]  traitor but certainly WikiLeaks is not what WikiLeaks has done is revealed
[3:27:44.600 --> 3:27:48.720]  true information about what was going on information that quite frankly was very
[3:27:48.720 --> 3:27:54.200]  helpful to Donald Trump was very helpful to the cause that now CIA director
[3:27:54.200 --> 3:27:59.400]  Pompeo is saying he doesn't like Julian Assange wants to come after him but of
[3:27:59.400 --> 3:28:03.120]  course he was applauding Julian Assange when he released this information and I
[3:28:03.120 --> 3:28:08.040]  think if we look at vault seven I've had people say that vault seven is not
[3:28:08.040 --> 3:28:14.480]  classified these hacks that they use to exploit into and to violate your
[3:28:14.480 --> 3:28:17.920]  privacy that it's not classified because if it were they would be guilty of
[3:28:17.920 --> 3:28:21.240]  distributing classified documents so they would have some liability there also
[3:28:21.240 --> 3:28:24.840]  not copyrighted because they wanted to keep it secret so it creates a very
[3:28:24.840 --> 3:28:30.160]  difficult situation for them that they don't want to address directly so
[3:28:30.160 --> 3:28:34.240]  they're going to engage in underhanded techniques to try to do something about
[3:28:34.240 --> 3:28:38.840]  this I don't approve of it I think that Julian Assange has done a great favor
[3:28:38.840 --> 3:28:44.600]  to the world to democracy here in America I don't think that those DNC
[3:28:44.600 --> 3:28:49.120]  documents were even hacked into that's a lie I think that was promulgated by
[3:28:49.120 --> 3:28:54.960]  people who were contractors to the DNC WikiLeaks and a UK ambassador said hey
[3:28:54.960 --> 3:28:58.640]  I traveled to the United States and it was handed these documents in a park by
[3:28:58.640 --> 3:29:03.080]  somebody who was upset about the DNC and I gave these documents as a whistleblower
[3:29:03.080 --> 3:29:09.760]  inside the DNC I gave these documents to WikiLeaks so I think that we need to
[3:29:09.760 --> 3:29:13.280]  really push back against this and hopefully we can get Donald Trump's ear
[3:29:13.280 --> 3:29:21.600]  on that I've been told that that he's a listener of your show and like I said
[3:29:21.600 --> 3:29:28.720]  I've been a longtime listener but I ever since the election is when I really put
[3:29:28.720 --> 3:29:32.680]  my best focus and my best effort into paying attention to everything guys have
[3:29:32.680 --> 3:29:37.040]  been saying so please forgive my ignorance on a lot of issues I love your
[3:29:37.040 --> 3:29:40.680]  show and and all the hard work that everybody on your cast and crew does
[3:29:40.680 --> 3:29:43.920]  and everything that you guys are going through well thanks we're gonna work on
[3:29:43.920 --> 3:29:47.560]  it we're gonna say it and you know what people need to make it clear to Donald
[3:29:47.560 --> 3:29:52.240]  Trump as well we'll be right back the empires on the run Alex Jones and the
[3:29:52.240 --> 3:29:55.680]  GCN radio network
[3:29:57.760 --> 3:30:02.760]  although conservative commentator and culture backed out of showing up to her
[3:30:02.760 --> 3:30:07.400]  already canceled speech at Berkeley that didn't stop freedom-loving Americans
[3:30:07.400 --> 3:30:12.240]  from conducting a large First Amendment rally in its place prominent social
[3:30:12.240 --> 3:30:17.360]  media icon such as Gavin McInnes Lauren Southern based stickman baked
[3:30:17.360 --> 3:30:22.240]  Alaska Brittany Pettibone and Faith Goldie showed up to support free speech
[3:30:22.240 --> 3:30:26.600]  and gave speeches reports that the Berkeley police did their job in
[3:30:26.600 --> 3:30:31.040]  protecting the peace have come in and apparently a total of six antifa
[3:30:31.040 --> 3:30:35.360]  protesters were arrested two for resisting arrest one for a drug
[3:30:35.360 --> 3:30:40.800]  violation and another for possessing a weapon two more arrests were made earlier
[3:30:40.800 --> 3:30:45.560]  in the day for possession of a knife and obstructing an officer and wearing a
[3:30:45.560 --> 3:30:50.280]  mask to evade police despite these arrests the protest remained peaceful and
[3:30:50.280 --> 3:30:55.120]  dialogue between both sides was present this is Millie Weaver reporting to you

[3:35:53.360 --> 3:35:57.040]  callers here Jason in Germany go ahead Jason
[3:35:57.040 --> 3:36:01.000]  Hey David good to be honest again I'll try to get through my two little points
[3:36:01.000 --> 3:36:04.080]  real quick first on the issue of fundraising and also supporting the
[3:36:04.080 --> 3:36:08.520]  info war I know the Alex and the info war crew and your whole operation there
[3:36:08.520 --> 3:36:13.320]  is one of only a few media organizations or or outfits that have the real big
[3:36:13.320 --> 3:36:17.360]  bulls I painted right on the back right on your back that everybody's going
[3:36:17.360 --> 3:36:22.560]  after so you know I want you to succeed because if you guys succeed then they
[3:36:22.560 --> 3:36:27.640]  help the rest of us succeed and and and and you know it's like a circle so I
[3:36:27.640 --> 3:36:30.840]  had a couple of ideas to help with that I remember when Alex first brought up
[3:36:30.840 --> 3:36:34.680]  the issue of Adroll kicking you guys off the revenue generation thing plan that
[3:36:34.680 --> 3:36:39.840]  you had was that centered around the info or the the health products that you
[3:36:39.840 --> 3:36:44.640]  guys advertise on other sites on yeah the Adroll yes they they stopped down
[3:36:44.640 --> 3:36:49.640]  with Adroll they stopped us from our ads from being served on other sites so
[3:36:49.640 --> 3:36:53.800]  just like with Breitbart what they did was they shut down Breitbart accepting
[3:36:53.800 --> 3:36:56.360]  ads from other people because you know you go to the Breitbart site you're
[3:36:56.360 --> 3:37:01.200]  looking at their articles ads get served there so that website gets revenue so
[3:37:01.200 --> 3:37:06.200]  Google stopped that with us we weren't depending on outside ads so much as we
[3:37:06.200 --> 3:37:10.440]  were serving our ads to other people we had our own and do have our own separate
[3:37:10.440 --> 3:37:15.080]  site infowarstore.com it is not political it has no political content on it
[3:37:15.080 --> 3:37:20.320]  there is no political content if you show people a bottle of iodine supplement
[3:37:20.320 --> 3:37:24.760]  or a bottle of vitamin B12 supplement but they said no no no because that is
[3:37:24.760 --> 3:37:29.680]  associated with info wars we're going to shut that down and that's what they have
[3:37:29.680 --> 3:37:32.920]  done to try to stop us from serving those ads so that's one of the things
[3:37:32.920 --> 3:37:36.920]  they've done of course lawsuits are very powerful too and if they can succeed and
[3:37:36.920 --> 3:37:42.940]  suing us and shutting us up when we talk about rampant crony capitalism when we
[3:37:42.940 --> 3:37:46.880]  talk about people coming into this country being put into the highest levels
[3:37:46.880 --> 3:37:51.160]  of power in this country because they are connected to the globalists that
[3:37:51.160 --> 3:37:55.080]  Davos because they're collected to the Clintons the Clinton global initiative
[3:37:55.080 --> 3:37:59.000]  you know what they ought to do the key ingredient of Chobani yogurt one of the
[3:37:59.000 --> 3:38:03.080]  key ingredients is not listed on there is crony capitalism taxpayer subsidies
[3:38:03.080 --> 3:38:07.360]  maybe that should be put on there in the name of honesty and truth and labeling so
[3:38:07.360 --> 3:38:11.920]  people really understand what's going on and if we go to this lawsuit discovery
[3:38:11.920 --> 3:38:14.720]  is going to show that that is going to be something we're going to tell people
[3:38:14.720 --> 3:38:20.240]  about the ingredients of your forced taxpayer subsidies on Chobani yogurt how
[3:38:20.240 --> 3:38:25.240]  these people have leveraged all of this to get into the school lunch program and
[3:38:25.240 --> 3:38:28.200]  all these other issues so it's it's a fight we're going to have but it's
[3:38:28.200 --> 3:38:33.240]  expensive so anyway I just I had this idea back when Alex first raised the
[3:38:33.240 --> 3:38:37.280]  issue and I just thought I know that the billionaires and the big businesses have
[3:38:37.280 --> 3:38:41.480]  a million ways Sunday to protect themselves from the kinds of guilt by
[3:38:41.480 --> 3:38:46.800]  association attacks that that enforced health has suffered from from Google
[3:38:46.800 --> 3:38:50.240]  side and I thought you know I'm not an attorney obviously so I thought maybe
[3:38:50.240 --> 3:38:55.960]  there's a way that Alex can repackage the whole infowars health at part of the
[3:38:55.960 --> 3:39:00.520]  business into a completely separate business that would allow him to get
[3:39:00.520 --> 3:39:04.720]  that ad revenue back and then it would in order for Google to cut you guys off
[3:39:04.720 --> 3:39:10.040]  they would have to actually show a more overt legal reason why they could use the
[3:39:10.040 --> 3:39:13.840]  guilt by association thing which I don't think would even work because I tell
[3:39:13.840 --> 3:39:17.720]  you what they could do I mean we we call the store info info wars store or
[3:39:17.720 --> 3:39:22.760]  whatever okay so it's got info wars in the name if we were to call it you know
[3:39:22.760 --> 3:39:27.120]  natural health subsidies or whatever they they would find a way to connect it
[3:39:27.120 --> 3:39:30.640]  with info wars once they learn that it was there they would find some excuse to
[3:39:30.640 --> 3:39:36.040]  shut it down I guarantee you because this isn't about the fact that people are
[3:39:36.040 --> 3:39:41.600]  concerned because they're seeing a bottle of caveman supplement there okay
[3:39:41.600 --> 3:39:45.880]  that's not about that so it is about coming after infowars and they can come
[3:39:45.880 --> 3:39:48.880]  up whatever kind of rationalization they want they would if we named it
[3:39:48.880 --> 3:39:52.400]  something else it would take them a little bit of time to find it but they
[3:39:52.400 --> 3:39:55.800]  would still do the same sort of thing so I understand what you're saying but
[3:39:55.800 --> 3:40:02.080]  it's it really is a focused targeted attack they find one individual within
[3:40:02.080 --> 3:40:06.680]  the news media if you will or they find a news organization they isolate and
[3:40:06.680 --> 3:40:10.200]  attack that organization once they're successful they go on to the next one
[3:40:10.200 --> 3:40:14.720]  and we're seeing this throughout the the press I mean you're seeing this with
[3:40:14.720 --> 3:40:18.480]  different organizations now they're coming after the mercers and their
[3:40:18.480 --> 3:40:21.920]  connection to the Heritage Foundation look it isn't going to end they're going
[3:40:21.920 --> 3:40:25.320]  to attack and isolate Bannon then they're gonna attack and isolate Heritage
[3:40:25.320 --> 3:40:28.280]  Foundation they're gonna attack and isolate the Cato Institute or what
[3:40:28.280 --> 3:40:32.760]  anybody that opposes their political agenda is gonna be isolated this is
[3:40:32.760 --> 3:40:35.880]  Stalinism this is Mayday we need to understand what this is about we're
[3:40:35.880 --> 3:40:38.920]  gonna get to that in a moment thank you Jason let's go to Bubba in Virginia Bubba
[3:40:38.920 --> 3:40:45.560]  yes David I'm calling about President Trump I think he's done a great job
[3:40:45.560 --> 3:40:49.720]  appreciate everything he's doing because you know in all reality he doesn't need
[3:40:49.720 --> 3:40:52.400]  to be doing this he could there's a thousand other things he could be doing
[3:40:52.400 --> 3:40:57.480]  other than this or he's putting himself and his family on the line there's one
[3:40:57.480 --> 3:41:01.960]  thing how I know he listens and I know that you and I let's talk to him if
[3:41:01.960 --> 3:41:04.760]  there's one thing he could do and he promised to do this the very first day
[3:41:04.760 --> 3:41:10.920]  on every his campaigning is that he could do away with this this insane it's a
[3:41:10.920 --> 3:41:14.760]  DOD directive that basically doesn't allow people to have weapons on no
[3:41:14.760 --> 3:41:19.560]  transpiration yeah it's insane you can do away with that I mean that was that
[3:41:19.560 --> 3:41:22.960]  would be phenomenal one of the main reasons why a sporting and voter for
[3:41:22.960 --> 3:41:25.840]  him and sending money and everything else because you know that'd be a great
[3:41:25.840 --> 3:41:31.600]  thing to bring out as an issue and I wish we could get Trump there's such a
[3:41:31.600 --> 3:41:35.440]  target-rich environment of things that need to be changed I understand his
[3:41:35.440 --> 3:41:39.440]  difficulty and I understand the fact that his biggest opposition is Republican
[3:41:39.440 --> 3:41:43.920]  Party the leadership in the Republican Party we look at what happened with
[3:41:43.920 --> 3:41:49.360]  Obamacare for example and even as the House Freedom Caucus really gave up on
[3:41:49.360 --> 3:41:54.120]  the idea of repeal and just ask well couldn't we at least have like the
[3:41:54.120 --> 3:41:59.640]  9th and 10th amendment for Obamacare and the so-called centrists and moderates
[3:41:59.640 --> 3:42:03.720]  in the Republican Party said no we're not gonna do that and so it still remains
[3:42:03.720 --> 3:42:07.080]  to be seen whether or not they're going to do that they are hardliners they're
[3:42:07.080 --> 3:42:12.120]  hardliner socialists and crony capitalists they're not centrist they're not
[3:42:12.120 --> 3:42:16.960]  moderates that's what the press calls them because the press wants Obamacare
[3:42:16.960 --> 3:42:21.480]  but you're talking about that that gun regulation that keeps people from being
[3:42:21.480 --> 3:42:25.200]  able to have firearms on military bases to protect themselves our soldiers who
[3:42:25.200 --> 3:42:29.280]  were trained on firearms and that is something that Donald Trump has fallen
[3:42:29.280 --> 3:42:34.720]  back to he did went to the NRA on the eve of the 100th anniversary it was the
[3:42:34.720 --> 3:42:38.720]  day of the one I think it was the day before anyway he spoke there and he
[3:42:38.720 --> 3:42:43.680]  understands that that is a key part of his core support and so he made a pledge
[3:42:43.680 --> 3:42:48.080]  there and as I talked about it on Friday there are still other tactics that
[3:42:48.080 --> 3:42:53.400]  are being put out there by the left to say hey if we even accuse you of a hate
[3:42:53.400 --> 3:42:58.080]  crime even if it's a misdemeanor if we say that you were hateful and even if
[3:42:58.080 --> 3:43:00.960]  you're not convicted we're gonna take your guns so they're still looking for
[3:43:00.960 --> 3:43:04.960]  different tactics to take people's second amendment right so be great for
[3:43:04.960 --> 3:43:09.240]  Donald Trump to make that an issue and on so many issues he has done the right
[3:43:09.240 --> 3:43:13.360]  thing my concern with Donald Trump has been that he needs to be careful and
[3:43:13.360 --> 3:43:18.080]  aware of who his friends and enemies are and when we look at what happened with
[3:43:18.080 --> 3:43:22.640]  Obamacare it was almost as if he thought that Paul Ryan was gonna work with him
[3:43:22.640 --> 3:43:26.960]  Paul Ryan is never gonna work with him on Obamacare or on tax cuts he's always
[3:43:26.960 --> 3:43:32.040]  gonna work against him and I was just disappointed to see the anger of Trump
[3:43:32.040 --> 3:43:37.040]  as this whole deal fell apart which was it was designed to do by Paul Ryan I
[3:43:37.040 --> 3:43:42.480]  think when this whole thing fell apart his attacks and his anger at the House
[3:43:42.480 --> 3:43:48.240]  Freedom Caucus was very ill-advised very very misdirected and so he needs to
[3:43:48.240 --> 3:43:51.880]  really set back and understand who his friends are who his enemies are I know
[3:43:51.880 --> 3:43:55.280]  he's got a lot of opposition there with the establishment and it's gonna be a
[3:43:55.280 --> 3:43:59.400]  tough row to hoe but he has to know who his friends and enemies are and he needs
[3:43:59.400 --> 3:44:03.680]  to perhaps get rid of some of these advisors especially taking out his
[3:44:03.680 --> 3:44:06.960]  daughter and Jared Kushner because it's not going to be a good thing for the
[3:44:06.960 --> 3:44:10.640]  family members already there's a lot of talk about the corruption that you've
[3:44:10.640 --> 3:44:14.880]  heard us talk about with Jared Kushner his enemies are going to hang that
[3:44:14.880 --> 3:44:19.600]  around his neck so they're going to get hammered by this they are not
[3:44:19.600 --> 3:44:25.320]  ideologically on the same page as Trump and Trump's base and so it's going to
[3:44:25.320 --> 3:44:29.840]  damage his support with his base if they are able to influence policy but
[3:44:29.840 --> 3:44:33.560]  there's gonna be a big price for them to pay in politics so they really should
[3:44:33.560 --> 3:44:37.760]  ask themselves if they want to be in this if they want to take the the people
[3:44:37.760 --> 3:44:43.120]  who are now behind them the left to think that they can use them to move the
[3:44:43.120 --> 3:44:47.160]  Trump administration maybe they can but you know the other thing is that when
[3:44:47.160 --> 3:44:50.040]  the left gets behind you understand that somebody has to get behind you
[3:44:50.040 --> 3:44:52.240]  before they can stick the knife in your back and that's what's going to
[3:44:52.240 --> 3:44:57.720]  eventually happen in Washington with the left with Jared and Ivanka so they ought
[3:44:57.720 --> 3:45:01.880]  to get them out get them back to working and and doing their own business
[3:45:01.880 --> 3:45:08.000]  thank you Bob I've got to go to Dan let's go to Dan in Illinois David yes
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:18.560]  doing it I met you in DC at the training station with I remember I also got to
[3:45:18.560 --> 3:45:27.960]  see Alex in Cleveland and I disrupted what I really want to say is common law
[3:45:27.960 --> 3:45:35.120]  if they ever drag Alex Jones back in the court for custody he needs to get Carl
[3:45:35.120 --> 3:45:43.800]  Lentz on his show to talk about common law it's not Admiralty law and it's not
[3:45:43.800 --> 3:45:50.160]  has nothing to do with sovereignty it's the law of the land we haven't had that
[3:45:50.160 --> 3:45:58.200]  since 18 maybe 90 and well I understand you know the problem is and I
[3:45:58.200 --> 3:46:01.240]  understand what the situation is and I understand what you're saying but the
[3:46:01.240 --> 3:46:07.040]  problem is is that we can't get people to agree on something as obvious as the
[3:46:07.040 --> 3:46:11.640]  First Amendment or the Second Amendment as clear and as plain as those are so
[3:46:11.640 --> 3:46:16.000]  when we get to the more obscure points of tax protesting or the more obscure
[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:21.040]  points of Admiralty law or whatever if we can't get people to understand on the
[3:46:21.040 --> 3:46:25.080]  clear meaning of the Fourth Amendment or the First Amendment or the Second
[3:46:25.080 --> 3:46:29.440]  Amendment if we can't get people to understand that civil asset forfeiture in
[3:46:29.440 --> 3:46:34.880]  no way can be supported by the Constitution and we can't really explain
[3:46:34.880 --> 3:46:38.680]  these other you know things about what's happened to our legal system what's
[3:46:38.680 --> 3:46:42.920]  happened to the government and I understand that you know we we don't
[3:46:42.920 --> 3:46:47.320]  have the Constitution anymore I understand that fully but I think we
[3:46:47.320 --> 3:46:50.360]  need to get people to understand look we don't have the Constitution because
[3:46:50.360 --> 3:46:53.280]  they're not giving people a trial and a conviction before they take their
[3:46:53.280 --> 3:46:57.080]  property we don't have the Constitution because they're doing illegal searches of
[3:46:57.080 --> 3:46:59.480]  us without a search warrant we don't have the Constitution because they're
[3:46:59.480 --> 3:47:02.520]  infringing on our Second Amendment rights we don't have the Constitution
[3:47:02.520 --> 3:47:06.440]  because they're coming after our religious excerpt free exercise of our
[3:47:06.440 --> 3:47:11.000]  religious beliefs and our free speech so once we get people to us say hey you
[3:47:11.000 --> 3:47:14.240]  know this is that why is it that they take an oath to the Constitution they
[3:47:14.240 --> 3:47:17.080]  don't obey in it then we can start talking about the other issues but
[3:47:17.080 --> 3:47:22.160]  that's the bigger elephant in the room that we need to point out first and get
[3:47:22.160 --> 3:47:26.560]  people to understand that no the Constitution really is a dead letter or
[3:47:26.560 --> 3:47:32.120]  as George W. Bush's reported to have said it's just a damn piece of paper when
[3:47:32.120 --> 3:47:36.840]  people understand that then we can start telling them how it got there and what
[3:47:36.840 --> 3:47:40.000]  we need to do to fix it but first they have to understand what the problem is
[3:47:40.000 --> 3:47:43.840]  and they have to care what the problem is thanks Dan I want to get to Mayday
[3:47:43.840 --> 3:47:49.400]  and I want to get to Venezuela which is a perfect example I think it was CNN
[3:47:49.400 --> 3:47:55.840]  that said how paradise was lost because you see the mainstream media thinks that
[3:47:55.840 --> 3:48:01.440]  socialism is a utopian paradise they think it can still succeed no matter
[3:48:01.440 --> 3:48:05.440]  how many times in this last century it has failed and I think it's interesting
[3:48:05.440 --> 3:48:10.240]  as we come in on the 100th anniversary of communism the great failed
[3:48:10.240 --> 3:48:15.680]  experiment of communism there were two revolutions in 1917 in Russia that
[3:48:15.680 --> 3:48:20.120]  ushered that in and of course they weren't on Mayday and Alex touched on
[3:48:20.120 --> 3:48:24.520]  this earlier why would they pick Mayday to celebrate well because Mayday was
[3:48:24.520 --> 3:48:30.440]  always a pagan satanic holiday so there's part of the connection that gets
[3:48:30.440 --> 3:48:34.960]  there I think when we look at NPR talking about Mayday celebrations around
[3:48:34.960 --> 3:48:38.920]  the world you know we set police on fire and things like that in Paris they
[3:48:38.920 --> 3:48:44.240]  also talk about the fact that it is a celebration of workers and immigrants
[3:48:44.240 --> 3:48:49.320]  because that's where they see the future coming that's their fifth column that
[3:48:49.320 --> 3:48:52.960]  they want to bring into the country so when we look at the pictures of we look
[3:48:52.960 --> 3:48:58.320]  at this NPR thing we got a babushka lady in Russia holding a picture of her
[3:48:58.320 --> 3:49:04.520]  beloved Joseph Stalin in nostalgia Papa Stalin okay and I guess I don't know if
[3:49:04.520 --> 3:49:08.560]  that lady is Worm Beatty's sister I think she's a little bit younger than that
[3:49:08.560 --> 3:49:11.400]  maybe or a little bit better makeup maybe had some more plastic surgery but
[3:49:11.400 --> 3:49:16.080]  you know it's about the age that Worm Beatty's sister would be but anyway as
[3:49:16.080 --> 3:49:20.320]  they talk about protesters in Paris just you know happened to throw gasoline
[3:49:20.320 --> 3:49:24.760]  bombs and setting the police on fire seriously burning them and so forth and
[3:49:24.760 --> 3:49:31.440]  then of course there's there's the nostalgia in Moscow but it's really
[3:49:31.440 --> 3:49:35.200]  Venezuela Venezuela that I want to focus on because even though they're
[3:49:35.200 --> 3:49:39.600]  having protests all over the US and of course now they're focusing on immigration
[3:49:39.600 --> 3:49:46.440]  I really want to talk about Venezuela and if we look at Venezuela and we have
[3:49:46.440 --> 3:49:53.440]  the CNN story how paradise got lost that's their headline and what do we see
[3:49:53.440 --> 3:49:58.320]  in Venezuela when we see plummeting oil prices we see the flow of dollars slow
[3:49:58.320 --> 3:50:02.240]  to a trickle we see children dying in hospitals because they can't get medicine
[3:50:02.240 --> 3:50:06.160]  they can't even get food they've got to go into Brazil to get medicine see this
[3:50:06.160 --> 3:50:10.800]  is where we're going to go and we need to make this point clearly understood
[3:50:10.800 --> 3:50:17.040]  because when I hear the Republican Party and President Trump talking about
[3:50:17.040 --> 3:50:23.040]  Obamacare President Trump is still focused on universal coverage if you're
[3:50:23.040 --> 3:50:27.240]  gonna focus on universal coverage we're gonna continue to have socialism and
[3:50:27.240 --> 3:50:32.440]  fascism that unique blend that Obamacare is a great example of and we're gonna
[3:50:32.440 --> 3:50:37.720]  continue to lose healthcare just as the Venezuelans have done you can't vote
[3:50:37.720 --> 3:50:42.600]  yourself a 60% increase in minimum wage and then think that you're better off
[3:50:42.600 --> 3:50:46.440]  when you've got absolutely no money when we come back we're gonna talk about
[3:50:46.440 --> 3:50:51.000]  that I want to cover an article that the New York Times had a recollection by a
[3:50:51.000 --> 3:50:54.440]  writer named Vivian Gornick talking about how she grew up in New York and a
[3:50:54.440 --> 3:50:57.080]  communist family and how she learned what it was about stay with us we'll be
[3:50:57.080 --> 3:51:02.040]  back hiring is the most challenging part of my job it's really hard the

[3:55:25.640 --> 3:55:32.000]  caveman at 53% off let's go to this this article here from Al Jazeera you know
[3:55:32.000 --> 3:55:36.440]  CNN says hey paradise has been lost and been as well what happened all these
[3:55:36.440 --> 3:55:39.840]  different metrics that we have here and as Al Jazeera points out they have the
[3:55:39.840 --> 3:55:44.960]  world's biggest known oil reserves so you think that they would be doing much
[3:55:44.960 --> 3:55:50.120]  better wouldn't you and yet they have the supports performer in terms of GDP
[3:55:50.120 --> 3:55:53.120]  growth per capita let's give you some of the other metrics that have been as
[3:55:53.120 --> 3:55:58.120]  well the place that has the world's biggest oil reserves they have 10.4
[3:55:58.120 --> 3:56:03.800]  billion and foreign reserves left yet they have a debt of 7.2 billion the IMF
[3:56:03.800 --> 3:56:08.880]  says that they've had a negative growth rate of minus 8% and they've had
[3:56:08.880 --> 3:56:15.720]  inflation of 481% an employment unemployment rate of 17% that is
[3:56:15.720 --> 3:56:19.880]  expected to go to 20% this year so everything is failing so what do you do
[3:56:19.880 --> 3:56:24.880]  well if you're a communist you vote yourself a raise so they've increased
[3:56:24.880 --> 3:56:32.280]  by 65 by 60% okay there you go that that solves it all doesn't it and you
[3:56:32.280 --> 3:56:37.000]  tell everybody that you've got universal health care and universal coverage
[3:56:37.000 --> 3:56:40.800]  you've even though people have to go to another country to get health treatment
[3:56:40.800 --> 3:56:44.760]  and medicine just kind of like we see with people fleeing the socialist system
[3:56:44.760 --> 3:56:49.880]  even in the UK and Canada coming to America we have to understand that a
[3:56:49.880 --> 3:56:53.440]  competitive marketplace even though there is no perfect system a competitive
[3:56:53.440 --> 3:56:57.840]  marketplace is going to be the only thing that is going to increase access
[3:56:57.840 --> 3:57:01.520]  to health care the only thing that is going to make health care more
[3:57:01.520 --> 3:57:08.440]  affordable are going to be markets not mandates choices not coercion we don't
[3:57:08.440 --> 3:57:13.240]  want to fall into this trap of measuring this in terms of how many people
[3:57:13.240 --> 3:57:17.320]  have insurance coverage that's not the metric we want to focus on if Donald
[3:57:17.320 --> 3:57:23.160]  Trump focuses on that metric we will lose and we may have already lost I
[3:57:23.160 --> 3:57:26.960]  don't know we'll have to see but we have to get onto a market system that's
[3:57:26.960 --> 3:57:32.000]  what he ran on he had a great plan on his campaign website which by the way is
[3:57:32.000 --> 3:57:35.040]  gone but you can always find it in the way back machine let's take a look at
[3:57:35.040 --> 3:57:39.680]  the recollection of Vivian Gornick and she writes on the New York Times when
[3:57:39.680 --> 3:57:43.680]  communism inspired America she talks about the fact that she grew up in the
[3:57:43.680 --> 3:57:48.400]  late 40s early 50s her parents were working-class socialists in New York all
[3:57:48.400 --> 3:57:53.040]  of their friends called themselves quote-unquote progressives okay but what
[3:57:53.040 --> 3:57:59.360]  she found was that one day she became very disillusioned they saw what
[3:57:59.360 --> 3:58:03.840]  happened with Stalin and as the revelations came out of the 20th
[3:58:03.840 --> 3:58:08.520]  Congress of the Soviet Communist Party and revealed to the world the horror of
[3:58:08.520 --> 3:58:14.600]  Stalin's rule her family was speechless she cried out lies lies treachery
[3:58:14.600 --> 3:58:18.480]  murder all in the name of socialism in the name of socialism and her parents
[3:58:18.480 --> 3:58:23.760]  said wait this can't be true the truth will eventually come out yeah it's far
[3:58:23.760 --> 3:58:28.120]  worse than that and we can see what's going on in Venezuela as well join us
[3:58:28.120 --> 3:58:32.280]  for three to five live and for the Info Wars Nightly News Night at 7 central
[3:58:32.280 --> 3:58:49.560]  8 p.m. Eastern
