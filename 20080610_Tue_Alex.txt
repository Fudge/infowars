[00:32.600 --> 00:37.120]  Corsi to discuss what's happening with the economy as a doctorate in economics
[00:37.120 --> 00:42.200]  breaking down what's happening with oil with the dollar with gold and a lot more
[00:42.200 --> 00:48.360]  continuing with a economic microscope we will have in the third hour Bob
[00:48.360 --> 00:53.960]  Chapman international forecaster joining us for his weekly visit as well
[00:53.960 --> 01:00.800]  we'll have open phones while both of those guests are on with us today I also
[01:00.800 --> 01:06.520]  before this hour ends yesterday I did the first two days of the Bilderberg
[01:06.520 --> 01:10.520]  group meeting or arriving Tuesday Wednesday I got up in my chronological
[01:10.520 --> 01:15.600]  order until Thursday morning and then never got back to it I want to kind of
[01:15.600 --> 01:19.120]  recap Tuesday and Wednesday hurriedly and then get into Thursday Friday
[01:19.120 --> 01:24.640]  Saturday and Sunday in a chronological order of the basics of what I witnessed
[01:24.640 --> 01:29.440]  I want to be clear to all the listeners tuning in that I thank you for your
[01:29.440 --> 01:32.960]  support we couldn't do what we do without you I thank you for all of your
[01:32.960 --> 01:39.440]  prayers I know when we have riled up the power elite and we've certainly done
[01:39.440 --> 01:45.160]  that we've gotten more threatening calls emails things of that nature we're
[01:45.160 --> 01:48.840]  trying to track those down and track down ISPs and file complaints and get the
[01:48.840 --> 01:52.680]  phone company to give us records from these unknown numbers but I want to be
[01:52.680 --> 02:00.680]  clear the Chantilly Marriott where they met there in Virginia on the edge of
[02:00.680 --> 02:06.680]  DC is in the middle of a large wooded compound but areas of the conference
[02:06.680 --> 02:11.120]  halls it's mainly a conference five-star hotel stick out right to the edge of the
[02:11.120 --> 02:17.080]  property line within about 30 not even 30 yards 25 yards of the road and getting
[02:17.080 --> 02:21.680]  up on the property line about 20 yards away we had a giant industrial bullhorn
[02:21.680 --> 02:27.520]  that somebody brought out there a great guy brought out and we were blasting them
[02:27.520 --> 02:32.040]  during their conference so imagine I basically and Luke Radowski and others
[02:32.040 --> 02:36.280]  that got on it for hour after hour after hour I mean we probably bullhorn them
[02:36.280 --> 02:40.720]  10 hours a day if you broke it all up from about 8 9 in the morning until 10 at
[02:40.720 --> 02:43.800]  night when the sound ordinance kicked in and we couldn't bullhorn which I think
[02:43.800 --> 02:48.280]  it's reasonable there's some neighborhoods in the area it was just
[02:48.280 --> 02:52.440]  incredible and and and I knew what I was doing I knew that was the main conference
[02:52.440 --> 02:55.840]  hall because I've been inside the hotel and I knew what I was doing when I went
[02:55.840 --> 02:59.600]  ahead and opened up on them I mean I'm loud on a normal bullhorn but on this
[02:59.600 --> 03:04.560]  gigantic one that's the equivalent of about four regular megaphones it was
[03:04.560 --> 03:09.880]  shaking the windows David Rockefeller Queen Beatrix the Queen of Spain the
[03:09.880 --> 03:15.320]  defense secretary Henry Kissinger all of them in there and literally taking
[03:15.320 --> 03:19.840]  over their meeting Richard in Haas came out and stared at us with hatred they
[03:19.840 --> 03:22.640]  would have the Secret Service would come over and try to order the police to
[03:22.640 --> 03:26.800]  kick us off of the right away they're on the side of the road to make us go
[03:26.800 --> 03:30.640]  across the street we refused Bilderberg didn't want to make a scene so they had
[03:30.640 --> 03:36.720]  to give in to us and they are very very mad and I knew what I was doing when I
[03:36.720 --> 03:42.400]  did it but man I mean they are angry they are upset we actually took over the
[03:42.400 --> 03:47.280]  Bilderberg group meeting I hope listeners understand the magnitude of what's
[03:47.280 --> 03:51.080]  happened we were bullhorning them from 8 in the morning till 10 at night night
[03:51.080 --> 03:57.760]  after night day after day after day after day with scores of people getting on
[03:57.760 --> 04:01.800]  the megaphone going through battery pack after battery pack after battery pack
[04:01.800 --> 04:05.680]  all told there are probably six seven different megaphones out there two medium
[04:05.680 --> 04:11.160]  sized ones a couple of big ones and one giant jumbo and the jumbo was running
[04:11.160 --> 04:15.960]  continually with people on it I bullhorned them probably two hours a day
[04:15.960 --> 04:20.400]  myself if you count all the bullhorning sessions I did for 20 30 minutes at a
[04:20.400 --> 04:25.080]  time blew out my voice you can tell us even more raspy you understand what's
[04:25.080 --> 04:29.400]  happened here we took over the Bilderberg group meeting they are threatening
[04:29.400 --> 04:35.120]  me they are calling my wife for dirty tricks and and and talking about burning
[04:35.120 --> 04:41.840]  down my house and things like that it is just amazing so I do think we deserve a
[04:41.840 --> 04:44.800]  little bit of respect out there for what we've done everybody that did it but
[04:44.800 --> 04:49.080]  especially me because my name is on the headline I mean that I'm the one they
[04:49.080 --> 04:53.660]  blame and I guess I deserve all the blame Bilderberg we'll be right back stay
[04:53.660 --> 05:00.960]  with me it is a big idea a new world order in the near future earth is

[08:23.120 --> 08:28.520]  had world leaders trying to set the agenda on banking on oil energy warb on
[08:28.520 --> 08:33.600]  the cashless society control grid our inside sources have confirmed that we
[08:33.600 --> 08:38.640]  are engaging in intelligence gathering against those are destroying the
[08:38.640 --> 08:42.480]  sovereignty of our country we went through Helen back being harassed being
[08:42.480 --> 08:46.280]  people trying to set a sub people threatening us people getting visited
[08:46.280 --> 08:54.040]  at their homes by military intelligence by Marines by diplomatic security
[08:54.040 --> 08:58.640]  service which is Marines in plain clothes people following us around in
[08:58.640 --> 09:04.360]  clown masks in their cars so we couldn't videotape their faces we bullhorned
[09:04.360 --> 09:10.800]  dozens of hours a day I mean it was just massive at weak points where the
[09:10.800 --> 09:17.920]  conference center backed up onto a main road in Chantilly we have gone in and
[09:17.920 --> 09:22.000]  taken over the Bilderberg group meeting we have gone in and taken over while
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.960]  they were having their secret conference where they fill up a meeting
[09:24.960 --> 09:29.160]  hall where they have big roundtable discussions do you understand what we've
[09:29.160 --> 09:34.840]  done a daring info raid a daring resistance to these people when they
[09:34.840 --> 09:38.040]  were driving out when they were driving in they weren't glaring at us and they
[09:38.040 --> 09:42.960]  were driving out Vernon Jordan and many others and the secret service were
[09:42.960 --> 09:48.680]  glaring at us also there are video stills up on the web and now photos up on
[09:48.680 --> 09:55.640]  the web that clearly show the M4 or some of them it appeared to me had the type
[09:55.640 --> 10:01.400]  of the buttstock that I've seen on MP5's but regardless sub machine guns and they
[10:01.400 --> 10:04.600]  would lift them up they would drive up turn their bodies towards us and lift
[10:04.600 --> 10:10.760]  them up and show us their guns I saw the full guns okay your eyes are quicker
[10:10.760 --> 10:14.800]  and more easily trained on guns and video cameras you've got to get them on and
[10:14.800 --> 10:19.200]  focus them but people are in denial there that Secret Service and others would
[10:19.200 --> 10:23.440]  have guns bringing in Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to
[10:23.440 --> 10:28.400]  Connellisa Rice and Gates and others but yes we had them brandishing those at us
[10:28.400 --> 10:35.400]  looking at us with absolute total hatred we are the enemy because we don't like
[10:35.400 --> 10:39.120]  three trillion going into a black hole in Iraq into their pockets we don't like
[10:39.120 --> 10:43.400]  four trillion missing from the Pentagon coffers over the last eight years we
[10:43.400 --> 10:48.280]  don't like all the corruption we don't like the North American Union we would
[10:48.280 --> 10:53.000]  dare go there and expose these people and ruin their meeting and when they came
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.760]  out they looked I mean Burton Jordan looked right at me for about five
[10:56.760 --> 11:02.120]  seconds as he drove up and around and out and he just looked at me with
[11:02.120 --> 11:10.480]  ab salute disgusted hatred and fear it was a very very intense look he
[11:10.480 --> 11:16.960]  looked right on to me and again I had all the secret police and the rest of them
[11:16.960 --> 11:22.600]  coming up talking to me by name asking me about my family the rest of it I've
[11:22.600 --> 11:26.760]  had Roth Cop the head of the Kissinger Group on he told me off air John Harmon
[11:26.760 --> 11:29.800]  heard it all that yeah we all know who you are and that's why I'm coming on to
[11:29.800 --> 11:34.720]  counter you I mean folks this is a pretty big deal do you know what it's like to
[11:34.720 --> 11:38.880]  have world leaders know who you are do you know what it's like to to have the
[11:38.880 --> 11:44.720]  opportunity to know their meeting in that hall just 25 yards away and to
[11:44.720 --> 11:50.120]  bullhorn them for hour after hour and 110 degree index heat hundred degree
[11:50.120 --> 11:55.440]  heat but 110 degree index but the local news reported to sit there and to do it
[11:55.440 --> 11:59.400]  I mean I just got to say that people that showed up have amazing courage it
[11:59.400 --> 12:03.120]  wasn't courage with me I cannot turn down an opportunity to get in their face
[12:03.120 --> 12:07.520]  to let them know this is a major psychological warfare blow against them
[12:07.520 --> 12:13.200]  they were shooken up and I'm told from inside sources that it really upset
[12:13.200 --> 12:16.000]  their meeting and upset their Apple Card I don't know what they're gonna do to me
[12:16.000 --> 12:22.960]  audits harassment are they gonna kill me are they gonna set me up I just if they
[12:22.960 --> 12:27.120]  kill me if they set me up know the disinfo agents will say all sorts of
[12:27.120 --> 12:31.480]  lies about me on the web posing as patriots they've only intensified their
[12:31.480 --> 12:36.120]  efforts and it isn't even about Alex Jones but I don't want the symbol that
[12:36.120 --> 12:41.160]  I've become and the symbol that info wars has become to be tainted I don't want
[12:41.160 --> 12:44.880]  them to be successful and I'm asking you the listeners to counter all the
[12:44.880 --> 12:49.760]  disinfo agents that lie about us and try to discredit us and try to say we're
[12:49.760 --> 12:55.280]  agents I don't want them to turn new minds off last night I was on my MySpace
[12:55.280 --> 12:58.680]  watching a clip of people that attacked me and they were admitting oh yeah we go
[12:58.680 --> 13:01.800]  out and hand out our material and everybody's heard of the other can you
[13:01.800 --> 13:04.800]  know conspiracy material and it makes it easier for us but the other
[13:04.800 --> 13:08.960]  conspiracy guys they're their government agents basically you've answered
[13:08.960 --> 13:12.200]  your own question showing that you're idiots I mean let's say you're some of
[13:12.200 --> 13:15.920]  you aren't government agents you're just jealous of us and envious of us and
[13:15.920 --> 13:20.520]  jealous of the work we do and you want to be the leaders fine be leaders but
[13:20.520 --> 13:24.520]  don't say yeah we've opened the door for you and we've woken up millions of
[13:24.520 --> 13:29.000]  people and because we don't totally agree with your analysis that that that
[13:29.000 --> 13:36.320]  we're agents look at the fruit look at how many people we've woken up I talked
[13:36.320 --> 13:39.400]  to even my detractors some of which are not agents they're just well-meaning
[13:39.400 --> 13:44.600]  dupes and fools or jealous of our work and they'll admit yeah nine out of ten
[13:44.600 --> 13:48.040]  people they talked to that are awake to the New World Order are awake because of
[13:48.040 --> 13:54.360]  one individual his name is Alex Jones now I'm not even particularly proud of
[13:54.360 --> 14:00.800]  that I'm just doing my duty it's it's it's literally burrowing a hole towards
[14:00.800 --> 14:04.280]  my destruction the closer I get to defeating them the closer I get to
[14:04.280 --> 14:09.000]  unlocking minds the more effective I get but I can't help it I knew when I
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.960]  bullhorned the conference hall from 20 25 yards away that I was putting my life
[14:13.960 --> 14:18.440]  in my hands that I was really on the edge of the razor blade on the edge of
[14:18.440 --> 14:23.240]  the precipice I knew when Haas came out and looked at me with red-faced stern
[14:23.240 --> 14:28.560]  hatred focused hatred you know he had a straight face with the eyes burned with
[14:28.560 --> 14:34.640]  murderous hatred I knew especially then I had an adrenaline rush a pang that you
[14:34.640 --> 14:37.840]  have when you stand on the edge of a cliff and I just turned it on even more
[14:37.840 --> 14:43.240]  and attacked Haas and called him out by name and I announced who I was just like
[14:43.240 --> 14:47.440]  John Hancock signed his name at the top of the list and as big as he could I have
[14:47.440 --> 14:55.600]  put my name my blood my treasure my family everything on the line and I just
[14:55.600 --> 14:59.120]  asked the people out there that constantly attack me and constantly
[14:59.120 --> 15:06.560]  exaggerate and constantly twist and constantly lie to be more reasonable I
[15:06.560 --> 15:11.960]  know most of you out there aren't agents it's it's a diseased modern mind
[15:11.960 --> 15:16.080]  that just constantly nitty and fight and complain and say you should have got
[15:16.080 --> 15:20.320]  video with this you should have not said that you know what I'm at least in the
[15:20.320 --> 15:24.960]  arena now I know there's a lot of disinfo people that our government
[15:24.960 --> 15:28.400]  that's been admitted we track back their IPs and they even have admitted their
[15:28.400 --> 15:31.680]  handles and we've gone to their other accounts and they kind of start the ball
[15:31.680 --> 15:37.200]  rolling a few key disinfo agents out there and again every time I mention
[15:37.200 --> 15:41.280]  this people think that I'm bringing this up because I'm being hurt or oh they're
[15:41.280 --> 15:46.440]  getting to me that is not what's happening I want you to understand I've
[15:46.440 --> 15:49.560]  been doing this longer than a lot of you have I want you to understand I have
[15:49.560 --> 15:54.400]  great discernment doesn't mean I'm perfect doesn't mean I even use my
[15:54.400 --> 15:58.400]  discernment or articulate the things I understand it's that I want to be
[15:58.400 --> 16:02.520]  effective and I want you to be right beside me and behind me and in front of
[16:02.520 --> 16:07.960]  me I want to work with everybody I want to win I want to bring down the New
[16:07.960 --> 16:13.440]  World Order that is my goal and the enemy is very good at picking at us and
[16:13.440 --> 16:16.880]  getting us to fight with each other and getting us to argue with each other and
[16:16.880 --> 16:21.840]  getting us to do all these things and I don't even know why I'm getting off into
[16:21.840 --> 16:27.000]  this now there's a lot of news here I want to get to it's just that we have to
[16:27.000 --> 16:32.320]  stay focused on the New World Order if we go out and we talk to the public about
[16:32.320 --> 16:34.680]  the central banks and how they're private and how they're destroying the
[16:34.680 --> 16:38.160]  dollars they can come in and buy up assets cheaper and also destroy the
[16:38.160 --> 16:44.480]  middle class so that we're dependent on government if we expose how there's a
[16:44.480 --> 16:48.880]  shadow government a secret group controlling both parties then people
[16:48.880 --> 16:53.080]  will look for real solutions we have to do the basics if we have to teach people
[16:53.080 --> 16:59.000]  the basics first before we and then on their own they will come to deeper
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.640]  understandings they will come to deeper nuances one reason more subtle nuances
[17:04.640 --> 17:11.400]  more details and that's what I do I try to bring out the general basic knowledge
[17:11.400 --> 17:17.080]  and then bring guests on who analyze certain specific sectors of the New
[17:17.080 --> 17:22.800]  World Order and literally knocking open the gates of the enemy citadels I mean
[17:22.800 --> 17:27.440]  look at the fruits we've born look at how many people we've woken up look at how
[17:27.440 --> 17:31.680]  we have expanded this movement look at how our listeners and then the people

[18:06.200 --> 18:11.960]  understand that that a lot of you've been very very negative and and have
[18:11.960 --> 18:16.080]  basically Monday morning quarterback or backseat driven a lot of things but I'm
[18:16.080 --> 18:21.320]  just here to tell you that no one can look at the work we've done and not said
[18:21.320 --> 18:25.760]  that it's been amazing no one can look at the work we've done and not said that
[18:25.760 --> 18:30.680]  we've unlocked hundreds of millions of minds no one can look at the work we've
[18:30.680 --> 18:35.400]  done and and and can say that we are not doing good and that we are not
[18:35.400 --> 18:40.880]  exposing the new world order crime syndicate because this is a radio show
[18:40.880 --> 18:46.120]  on scores of AM and FM mom and pop standalone stations across the country
[18:46.120 --> 18:51.600]  and we have shortwave and internet and satellite because of the supporters that
[18:51.600 --> 18:56.840]  support us and we are exponentially reaching more people we have exploded it
[18:56.840 --> 19:02.760]  our growth curve is exponential and we are in the danger zone we are in the

[24:20.160 --> 24:26.760]  and use his real name he knows how to bake the mainstream media all of you
[24:26.760 --> 24:33.960]  can learn these tricks and we don't even really communicate except maybe once
[24:33.960 --> 24:38.960]  every few months I just learned minutes ago that he's starting a campaign to
[24:38.960 --> 24:46.360]  release a 9-11 truth DVDs like Terror Storm in-game loose change final cut to
[24:46.360 --> 24:52.320]  troops in Iraq and Fox News went completely ape by the way network we
[24:52.320 --> 24:55.120]  just sent you that clip I want to play some of that audio when Mark comes up
[24:55.120 --> 24:58.840]  in the next segment this is the type of thing we're talking about things that
[24:58.840 --> 25:03.200]  are effective in multiple facets it is very effective to wake up police and
[25:03.200 --> 25:06.040]  military because if Terry he's gonna come to your door it's gonna come in a
[25:06.040 --> 25:10.360]  uniform we've got to unlock their minds show them the big picture not let them
[25:10.360 --> 25:13.880]  be corrupted by the New World Order try to take their souls back from the New
[25:13.880 --> 25:17.440]  World Order try to wake them up try to get them back on the side of goodness
[25:17.440 --> 25:23.080]  and honor most of them are good evidence by Ron Paul getting 70 plus percent of
[25:23.080 --> 25:26.800]  all the Republican donations from the troops more than all Republican
[25:26.800 --> 25:31.240]  candidates combined more than Barack Obama on the Democratic side or Hillary
[25:31.240 --> 25:36.360]  individually they're good men and women most of them the dark sides tried to
[25:36.360 --> 25:39.440]  twist them some of them now are waking up some of them were partially
[25:39.440 --> 25:44.680]  seduced but what did he do sending DVDs which he just put the idea out you can
[25:44.680 --> 25:49.840]  all do it he's posted ways to do it on the resistance manifesto.com but then
[25:49.840 --> 25:56.280]  it has the double effect of the mainstream media going absolutely ape we
[25:56.280 --> 26:01.840]  know how to counter the New World Order we understand their attack profile we
[26:01.840 --> 26:08.400]  understand the enemy's operations then if you will move against them nothing
[26:08.400 --> 26:15.120]  can stop us the creator of the universe is on our side had an atheist
[26:15.120 --> 26:17.760]  professor calling yesterday's written some well-known books I'm gonna get on
[26:17.760 --> 26:20.360]  the show and he said I couldn't help it when you were saying pray for you I did
[26:20.360 --> 26:25.480]  I could I could feel it it's real ladies and gentlemen the enemy knows it's real
[26:25.480 --> 26:32.280]  the enemy is into a dark energy force we are into love and decency and honor and
[26:32.280 --> 26:39.960]  creativity they are into destruction and pain and sorrow and terror massive
[26:39.960 --> 26:44.200]  developments after Mark joins us he's at work so he only joined us for about 10
[26:44.200 --> 26:49.800]  minutes in between being a furniture salesman he fights the New World Order
[26:49.800 --> 26:54.440]  video shows someone near governor's mansion before fired EPS officials trying
[26:54.440 --> 26:57.520]  to determine how at least one person might have entered the property and of
[26:57.520 --> 27:02.160]  others are involved they've been caught lying the DPS it looks like 18 minutes
[27:02.160 --> 27:08.040]  after the fire was reported and the local fire department APD say yes that the
[27:08.040 --> 27:10.920]  individual we interviewed yesterday we went out to the governor's mansion that's
[27:10.920 --> 27:16.960]  up on YouTube he's a listener by the way that he reported it first walking back
[27:16.960 --> 27:22.000]  from a live music event with his wife parked in a parking lot nearby 18 minutes
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.480]  roughly after he reported 15 to 20 the news is saying 18 the fire trucks arrived
[27:27.480 --> 27:32.440]  then the state police who were garrisoned in a building literally 50 yards from
[27:32.440 --> 27:38.600]  where the fire was on the front porch we also have the DPS lying and saying they
[27:38.600 --> 27:46.680]  called 911 first the Austin Police Department and the fire department are
[27:46.680 --> 27:51.840]  saying it is not true they received no call from them until at least 15 minutes
[27:51.840 --> 27:57.880]  after they responded again the fire department 15 plus minutes after that's
[27:57.880 --> 28:00.960]  decent response time for the fire department the point is they did a
[28:00.960 --> 28:04.320]  great job the point is the state police and it's in the front page of the paper
[28:04.320 --> 28:08.200]  today have been caught lying I was out there yesterday they were acting
[28:08.200 --> 28:12.400]  extremely guilty faced I'm not saying the state police out there guarding the
[28:12.400 --> 28:15.360]  governor's mansion are involved individually I'm saying there's a cover
[28:15.360 --> 28:23.640]  up then I only had the big nine-foot riot iron spiked topped fence with
[28:23.640 --> 28:28.440]  individual trees having four cameras a piece in them I have no idea how many
[28:28.440 --> 28:33.360]  cameras I'm estimating 50 the Capitol across the street with a huge garrison
[28:33.360 --> 28:38.920]  of at least 30 and I looked it up 30 state police at any one time over there
[28:38.920 --> 28:43.600]  the state police capital police garrisoned there and at the governor's
[28:43.600 --> 28:50.040]  mansion and then they lied and said they called 911 when they did not a huge
[28:50.040 --> 28:58.280]  fire burning from the time it got called in for 18 minutes clearly burning
[28:58.280 --> 29:06.280]  before that and nothing happened garrisoned there is a large building on
[29:06.280 --> 29:12.560]  the property right beside the governor's mansion which is their surveillance
[29:12.560 --> 29:19.080]  building and where they stay and where they where they have a lunch room so
[29:19.080 --> 29:21.800]  we'll be getting into the Texas governor's mansion which was the White
[29:21.800 --> 29:26.240]  House for the nation of Texas the Republic of Texas Sam Houston lived
[29:26.240 --> 29:30.800]  there and we're to believe someone didn't just scale the rod iron they had
[29:30.800 --> 29:38.640]  another 10 foot security fence up around it for construction two fences they
[29:38.640 --> 29:45.080]  scaled it and set it on fire and then the state police stood down we're on the

[33:15.880 --> 33:21.640]  a government that helped to carry out the 9-11 attacks this is not a joke this
[33:21.640 --> 33:27.280]  is actually happening these letters are the work of mark dice the founder of a
[33:27.280 --> 33:31.960]  group called the resistance mark joins us live now along with captain Pete
[33:31.960 --> 33:36.720]  Hexeth Pete is a National Guardsman who served in Iraq and he is the executive
[33:36.720 --> 33:41.760]  director of vets for freedom good morning gentlemen morning mark let me
[33:41.760 --> 33:45.680]  start with you do you think this is helpful for to our troops serving on
[33:45.680 --> 33:51.240]  the ground in Iraq I think that it's very beneficial that we inform them as to
[33:51.240 --> 33:56.880]  the true circumstances that got them in the situation I think that if they're
[33:56.880 --> 34:00.840]  able to make better decisions based on the facts and they can decide to direct
[34:00.840 --> 34:04.200]  their lives and their careers and the positions and the direction that they
[34:04.200 --> 34:09.360]  want to go I think feeding them a constant stream of propaganda is is one
[34:09.360 --> 34:13.160]  of the most detrimental things to them and to our service what do you want them
[34:13.160 --> 34:18.240]  to do abandon the war to just walk off the battlefield we want them to join the
[34:18.240 --> 34:22.400]  9-11 truth movement we want them to ask their superiors hard and compelling
[34:22.400 --> 34:27.000]  questions about the circumstances of 9-11 is that the role of an American
[34:27.000 --> 34:32.720]  soldier well we want them to get the leadership to start thinking about what
[34:32.720 --> 34:36.120]  it is that they're sending these troops into look everybody knows that the troops
[34:36.120 --> 34:41.680]  are so angry that the they've been put in that position based on lies Ron Paul
[34:41.680 --> 34:46.720]  had the largest donations from the troops themselves the troops know I
[34:46.720 --> 34:51.200]  personally know United States Marines active Marines who served in Iraq who
[34:51.200 --> 34:54.680]  know that 9-11's an inside job we're trying to get the word out to as many
[34:54.680 --> 34:59.520]  people as possible not keep them with the wool over their eyes he continued to
[34:59.520 --> 35:04.880]  put his mark accurately character all right ladies and gentlemen ladies and
[35:04.880 --> 35:09.680]  gentlemen this is pure info war for the Republic I wish I would have thought of
[35:09.680 --> 35:12.800]  this idea but that's why I'm glad there's other great minds out there in
[35:12.800 --> 35:18.600]  case they imprison me kill me set me up I feel good going to sleep at night back
[35:18.600 --> 35:21.760]  just two nights ago I was going to sleep getting back from Bilderberg and I
[35:21.760 --> 35:24.640]  thought who is there out there fighting the New World Order and I thought of
[35:24.640 --> 35:30.040]  Mark Dice I thought of Mark Kornke I thought of just a handful of other
[35:30.040 --> 35:34.840]  people officer Jack McClam I thought of Pastor Butch Paw I thought of Luke
[35:34.840 --> 35:39.720]  Rodalski I thought of just a handful of other people now if something happens to
[35:39.720 --> 35:43.520]  me who would take my place at the head of the spear at the very tip of the
[35:43.520 --> 35:47.400]  spear and it just feels good to know that we have other leaders that really
[35:47.400 --> 35:51.600]  have great ideas and are effective and who don't cause division or in fighting
[35:51.600 --> 35:55.640]  our movement but just keep engaging the enemy engaging the enemy now you got to
[35:55.640 --> 35:59.600]  go to mark dice.com because you've got to be in the military you've got to sign
[35:59.600 --> 36:05.160]  up to ask for packages to be sent to you or if your family and are already on a
[36:05.160 --> 36:09.240]  list just slip it in there with the candy or the books or the things you send
[36:09.240 --> 36:14.240]  you know just send them disc a lot of it gets searched so send it unmarked and
[36:14.240 --> 36:18.200]  just say important information for you there's a lot of different ways to do
[36:18.200 --> 36:23.880]  this but joining us is Mark Dice formerly of course known as John Connor
[36:23.880 --> 36:28.040]  with a resistance manifesto his real name is Mark Dice he of course earlier
[36:28.040 --> 36:31.200]  when he was finishing up college and things wanted to go with the resistance
[36:31.200 --> 36:35.160]  covertly but now he is out in the open no longer wearing the dark sunshades we
[36:35.160 --> 36:40.560]  commend his courage. Mark another super idea A when did you think of this B tell
[36:40.560 --> 36:45.120]  us about the program and then C tell us about the Fox News appearance. I thought
[36:45.120 --> 36:49.080]  of it last week there was a guest speaker at our church that had organized a
[36:49.080 --> 36:52.520]  program where people could write to US troops stationed in Iraq and I just
[36:52.520 --> 36:56.040]  thought what a great idea instead of just writing them some nonsense about
[36:56.040 --> 36:59.320]  what's going on in the pop culture world I thought we could send them some DVDs
[36:59.320 --> 37:04.280]  of Terror Storm, loose change, Final Cut and others and again you need to go and
[37:04.280 --> 37:07.800]  sign up with an adoptive soldier program there's links through on my website
[37:07.800 --> 37:12.200]  you need to get a specific name and an address of a soldier you can't just send
[37:12.200 --> 37:15.960]  a random package in so there's free services that will put you into contact
[37:15.960 --> 37:19.720]  with the soldier and it's a good idea not to mark the package or if you're
[37:19.720 --> 37:24.280]  gonna send out a DVD don't send it in the package or in the box they'll look
[37:24.280 --> 37:28.680]  at the package and see that the DVD is is gonna cause problems so just send a
[37:28.680 --> 37:33.480]  DVD or a burned copy into them and it's a great day when some truth and some
[37:33.480 --> 37:36.960]  accurate information can slip through the mockingbirds and the gatekeepers on
[37:36.960 --> 37:41.280]  Fox News and get to the masses. It's also important I think to load the films on
[37:41.280 --> 37:48.240]  thumb drives and we'll just a note saying watch this important info because a
[37:48.240 --> 37:51.720]  lot of them have computers they don't have DVD players but a lot of the
[37:51.720 --> 37:55.680]  computers do have DVD players you know send it in multiple formats that
[37:55.680 --> 38:00.400]  continue. Also let's send them copies of Operation Northwoods let's send them
[38:00.400 --> 38:05.920]  letters, articles, chapters from books and let's just continue to get the word
[38:05.920 --> 38:09.320]  out and you're right Fox News went ballistic I can't believe that they've
[38:09.320 --> 38:12.360]  been let me on the air one of their mockingbirds must have been asleep at
[38:12.360 --> 38:15.000]  the switch. Yeah they took the bait big time well no they're gonna try to say
[38:15.000 --> 38:18.520]  it's sedition and you're a traitor when they're the traitors that have hijacked
[38:18.520 --> 38:23.120]  this country lied about WMD's tried to get US aircraft shot down White House
[38:23.120 --> 38:29.240]  memo high treason you know we've now got the guy that you know convicted Charlie
[38:29.240 --> 38:33.160]  Manson coming out and saying they wanted to stage terror attacks and they got
[38:33.160 --> 38:36.720]  top prosecutors saying what we're saying now and we've got governors saying at
[38:36.720 --> 38:39.960]  German defense ministers they're in trouble they're the terrorist. A few
[38:39.960 --> 38:43.480]  minutes after the civic segment they aired some hate mail guided towards me
[38:43.480 --> 38:46.800]  and that's amazing because I've gotten some supporting letters from active
[38:46.800 --> 38:50.520]  Marines and from veterans and as I said in the segment I know Marines I have
[38:50.520 --> 38:54.040]  friends that are Marines active Marines that served over there corporals
[38:54.040 --> 38:57.840]  Lance corporals and they are in the truth movement they're involved in this
[38:57.840 --> 39:01.920]  and they tell me that up to one-third of their friends and their units believe
[39:01.920 --> 39:04.800]  it but again it's so dangerous for them to speak out like I said in the
[39:04.800 --> 39:08.320]  segment we're just trying to create a safe climate for them to facilitate a
[39:08.320 --> 39:13.000]  discussion and really just stick it to the new world order knowing that the
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.240]  troops now know the truth so let's kind of shift gears here a little bit instead
[39:17.240 --> 39:21.680]  of just street actions and handing out DVDs to ordinary crowds let's get
[39:21.680 --> 39:25.200]  organized here let's send them to the troops over there and really let's make
[39:25.200 --> 39:28.280]  our voices there's another attack pattern in the info or you can also be
[39:28.280 --> 39:31.640]  living your basis you can go into the bars they frequent just say hey check
[39:31.640 --> 39:35.880]  this out powerful info that way or if you're in the military you can carry
[39:35.880 --> 39:39.960]  these in unmarked when you go back into country and just leave them around
[39:39.960 --> 39:43.680]  places you all you want to be careful if you're gonna be hanging out in bars
[39:43.680 --> 39:46.600]  some of them are the Marines are a pretty rough crowd and if you start
[39:46.600 --> 39:51.200]  addressing these issues they could get quite angry or or or violent towards
[39:51.200 --> 39:55.480]  you but maybe hit up marine communities that's not my experience I've hit
[39:55.480 --> 40:00.160]  troops up in restaurants and in bars myself so what's amazing because I
[40:00.160 --> 40:02.920]  spent quite a few time I have friends up in Oceanside which is the home of
[40:02.920 --> 40:06.000]  Camp Pendleton and and I'll bring these issues up very lightly and it's
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.440]  incredible how many Marines will agree or at least suspect it and you know this
[40:10.440 --> 40:13.400]  phony that was on there trying to counter me this head of this Veterans
[40:13.400 --> 40:17.760]  Association is saying that everybody in the Marines knows all the soldiers know
[40:17.760 --> 40:21.240]  their duty and they're ready to fight every Marine that I talked to is fed up
[40:21.240 --> 40:24.760]  and disgusted and they can't speak up about it otherwise they're gonna get
[40:24.760 --> 40:27.840]  even if they don't think 9-11's an inside job and have it found out yet they
[40:27.840 --> 40:30.960]  know they lied about WMD's they know they lied about how long they'd be there
[40:30.960 --> 40:33.880]  premeditatedly their own documents in the Pentagon saying they'll be there for
[40:33.880 --> 40:38.680]  50 plus years and so they've all heard about the other staged events it's now
[40:38.680 --> 40:42.600]  come out in the Chicago Tribune what we reported on in Terror Storm that the US
[40:42.600 --> 40:46.320]  government in Israel did premeditatedly attack the USS Liberty in order a
[40:46.320 --> 40:50.560]  stand-down of fighter protection to try to sink the ship to blame it on Egypt and
[40:50.560 --> 40:54.480]  this trader this head of this Veterans Association obviously is not informing
[40:54.480 --> 40:58.880]  his people or anybody else about the Gulf of Tonkin and USS Liberty and either
[40:58.880 --> 41:02.280]  he doesn't know anything about military history or he's just a typical shell and
[41:02.280 --> 41:05.480]  I think he's on the Fox News payroll I've seen him on the on the network
[41:05.480 --> 41:11.320]  multiple times yeah no that's the group that puts out the propaganda TV ads yeah
[41:11.320 --> 41:15.360]  all this wars all the troops support the war everything's just great yeah well
[41:15.360 --> 41:20.280]  we do have organizations of Marines for 9-11 truth I've seen 9-11 truth actions
[41:20.280 --> 41:24.800]  with the Marine in uniform out there so we have a lot of the military and you
[41:24.800 --> 41:27.880]  know like I said like everybody knows Ron Paul got the largest amount of
[41:27.880 --> 41:31.680]  donations from the troops Ron Paul's against the war what does that say
[41:31.680 --> 41:35.760]  about these individuals that the pro Fox News leave it to all the networks of
[41:35.760 --> 41:39.600]  Fox News to try to attack us try to attack this message and mark that we're
[41:39.600 --> 41:44.240]  sending hate mail I just learned of this during the last break only saw part of
[41:44.240 --> 41:47.000]  the clip we're gonna play the rest of it later so everybody's learning about
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.800]  this as I learn about it as well were you able to get out mark dice calm I
[41:50.800 --> 41:55.480]  wasn't it was extremely short is about five minutes they cut me off twice and
[41:55.480 --> 41:59.180]  I was they didn't even have a chance to get a lower third put on there with the
[41:59.180 --> 42:02.000]  website that's why you gotta open I'm not I'm not knocking you you've got a
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.640]  degree in media but the point is I would have opened with mark dice calm yeah
[42:06.640 --> 42:10.120]  that's a good point I people are smart enough now some of them to just Google
[42:10.120 --> 42:13.640]  mark dice or the resistance and research for those terms were the first site to
[42:13.640 --> 42:17.360]  come up but yeah well I'm gonna be clear here mark and then I'm gonna let you
[42:17.360 --> 42:22.080]  have your say that they're destroying our country they're destroying our dollar
[42:22.080 --> 42:25.880]  the North American Union's coming in we are the Patriots we have a duty and a
[42:25.880 --> 42:29.320]  right to wait the troops up it's our first amendment they encourage the
[42:29.320 --> 42:33.520]  public to send them stuff and it's our right to do it and I've already seen
[42:33.520 --> 42:36.920]  some blurbs about how you know you're a trader we're a trader for doing this what
[42:36.920 --> 42:40.840]  do you say to that no actually we care about the troops probably more than
[42:40.840 --> 42:43.620]  some of these individuals were the ones that are reaching out and spending our
[42:43.620 --> 42:47.840]  time to get them some information some valuable information many of the people
[42:47.840 --> 42:51.320]  in the truth movement spend their own time and money copying DVDs and handing
[42:51.320 --> 42:54.400]  out information so we're the ones that actually care about their well-being
[42:54.400 --> 42:57.080]  we're the ones that are trying to get them informed and trying to get them
[42:57.080 --> 43:01.560]  home and trying to expose this mechanism that's caused them to get their lives
[43:01.560 --> 43:05.720]  put in danger in the first place well that's why this info or attack pattern
[43:05.720 --> 43:11.080]  is so key because it it's it's headless it's total lone wolf and it's
[43:11.080 --> 43:14.880]  unstoppable that the listeners just put it into action flooding hundreds of
[43:14.880 --> 43:20.360]  thousands of DVDs and thumb drives and you can put martial law you know all my
[43:20.360 --> 43:23.720]  films you can go to prison planet TV download them in high quality put them
[43:23.720 --> 43:28.000]  on thumb drives put them on this you can put order of order out of chaos book
[43:28.000 --> 43:30.800]  about government-sponsored terror by Paul Watson my book to sit in the
[43:30.800 --> 43:35.960]  tyranny on ebook on a tiny thumb drive and then send that into them there is so
[43:35.960 --> 43:40.000]  much we can do here yeah and you know I meant to get out the questioning why
[43:40.000 --> 43:43.360]  they won't cover the Bilderberg group and plug terror storm and loose change
[43:43.360 --> 43:48.360]  final cut things happen so fast but again leave a great job news to try to
[43:48.360 --> 43:51.840]  attack us and say that we're sending them hate mail we're not sending them
[43:51.840 --> 43:55.840]  hate mail these are heartfelt letters and giving them valuable information that
[43:55.840 --> 43:59.000]  they need and how many people actually will sit out and and write the troops a
[43:59.000 --> 44:01.960]  leather other than their own family well this is life and death the new world
[44:01.960 --> 44:05.920]  orders coming down on us we don't have a choice our backs against the wall we're
[44:05.920 --> 44:12.240]  defending ourselves peacefully with information and again we have got to do
[44:12.240 --> 44:17.800]  this and this is a powerful idea mark dice yeah and also want to encourage
[44:17.800 --> 44:22.240]  people to just email links from stories on infowars calm and prison planet calm
[44:22.240 --> 44:26.200]  into Fox News and that's how they pick this up you they somebody goes through
[44:26.200 --> 44:29.920]  and reads all those emails that the shows that get emailed the Fox News and
[44:29.920 --> 44:33.560]  and news tips at Fox News whatever their email addresses are if you just send in
[44:33.560 --> 44:37.400]  the URL from a prison planet story sometime they might actually pick that
[44:37.400 --> 44:40.520]  up so again everybody if you want to get involved if you want to do this you
[44:40.520 --> 44:46.160]  have to sign up we're going to go through adopt a u.s. soldier org you can go
[44:46.160 --> 44:49.760]  through my website to do that you can do it largely through churches they'll
[44:49.760 --> 44:53.680]  have organizations and soldiers names and addresses will put you into contact
[44:53.680 --> 44:58.240]  with them and of course we want to be nice and we want to be caring and you
[44:58.240 --> 45:01.760]  know they try to say that oh we're sending them hate mail and and they're
[45:01.760 --> 45:05.320]  they're risking their lives for the pawns in the new world order we don't
[45:05.320 --> 45:08.360]  want them to be pawns in the new world order that's why we're doing this and I
[45:08.360 --> 45:12.440]  just want to urge everybody if you feel the need to get out there and get on
[45:12.440 --> 45:16.120]  board you've got your powerful press release at the resistance manifesto
[45:16.120 --> 45:19.760]  dot com or mark dice dot com goes to the same place you've got a big banner at
[45:19.760 --> 45:23.600]  the top that everybody should put on their site I want you for the resistance
[45:23.600 --> 45:28.360]  great banner with Uncle Sam on it now with the resistance on his hat telling
[45:28.360 --> 45:33.800]  everybody this is a key thing to do this is absolute genius this is all of our
[45:33.800 --> 45:38.040]  minds working together coming up with these type of ideas and I'm just glad
[45:38.040 --> 45:40.920]  that you put terror storm and loose change final cut both films that I'm
[45:40.920 --> 45:46.760]  involved in producing out to them and mark I just absolutely commend you they
[45:46.760 --> 45:50.400]  also hate it because I'm not knocking hippies or how hippies look but you know
[45:50.400 --> 45:53.960]  you're a big six foot four you know big you know handsome conservative looking
[45:53.960 --> 45:57.960]  guy you are conservative a Christian churchgoer and it just really upsets
[45:57.960 --> 46:01.520]  them you know to have that archetypal image of a you know healthy good
[46:01.520 --> 46:06.560]  American up there that even makes them more angry yeah I didn't think they
[46:06.560 --> 46:10.040]  probably suspected I wasn't going to be able to communicate the ideas they would
[46:10.040 --> 46:13.680]  open the door I'd open the door for attack for myself you know I had to get
[46:13.680 --> 46:16.800]  up at 4 30 in the morning to do this and then the stupid producer calls me at
[46:16.800 --> 46:20.680]  2 30 in the morning and asked me if I got the confirmation and all this
[46:20.680 --> 46:24.920]  crap so I really got no sleep so did the best I could and I got a runoff to the

[56:21.400 --> 56:27.840]  more than 15 after he called and I was watching the news at reporter interrogating
[56:27.840 --> 56:31.960]  him going were you drunk are you lying did you really call 911 and I was like

[57:14.800 --> 57:18.360]  Capitol grounds contends it made the first call Perez's immediate response
[57:18.360 --> 57:21.360]  has called controversy over the effectiveness of security that night
[57:21.360 --> 57:25.560]  something that shocked Perez as he watched the mansion burn and then they go
[57:25.560 --> 57:31.280]  on I didn't see nobody out there for 8 to 10 minutes no no no see I watched the
[57:31.280 --> 57:35.800]  interview we have the raw footage of news 8 interviewing him and of CBS

[58:08.760 --> 58:12.200]  Perez about what happened that night hoping to piece together a more accurate

[1:00:41.840 --> 1:00:45.120]  propaganda piece in total
[1:00:47.120 --> 1:00:52.360]  imagine that you are a soldier stationed in Iraq mail call comes around and
[1:00:52.360 --> 1:00:55.640]  you've got a letter from back home but it is not from your family or your
[1:00:55.640 --> 1:01:01.360]  friends it is a letter telling you that you are a pawn in the service of the
[1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:06.600]  quote new world order and that you are risking your life for a government that
[1:01:06.600 --> 1:01:11.880]  helped to carry out the 9-11 attacks this is not a joke this is actually
[1:01:11.880 --> 1:01:17.320]  happening these letters are the work of mark dice the founder of a group called
[1:01:17.320 --> 1:01:23.200]  the resistance mark joins us live now along with captain Pete Hexeth Pete is
[1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:26.760]  a national guardsman who served in Iraq and he is the executive director of
[1:01:26.760 --> 1:01:32.880]  vets for freedom good morning gentlemen morning mark let me start with you do
[1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:38.360]  you think this is helpful to our troops serving on the ground in Iraq I think
[1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:42.040]  that it's very beneficial that we inform them as to the true circumstances
[1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:47.400]  that got them in the situation I think that if they're able to make better
[1:01:47.400 --> 1:01:51.160]  decisions based on the facts that they can decide to direct their lives and
[1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:54.840]  their careers and the positions and the direction that they want to go I think
[1:01:54.840 --> 1:01:59.160]  feeding them a constant stream of propaganda is is one of the most
[1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:02.960]  detrimental things to them and to our service what do you want them to do
[1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:07.800]  abandon the war to just walk off the battlefield we want them to join the
[1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:11.960]  9-11 truth movement we want them to ask their superiors hard and compelling
[1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:16.560]  questions about the circumstances of 9-11 is that the role of an American
[1:02:16.560 --> 1:02:22.280]  soldier well we want them to get the leadership to start thinking about what
[1:02:22.280 --> 1:02:25.400]  it is that they're sending these troops into look everybody knows that the
[1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:30.840]  troops are so angry that they've been put in that position based on lies Ron
[1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:36.240]  Paul had the largest donations from the troops themselves the troops know I
[1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:40.760]  personally know United States Marines active Marines who served in Iraq who
[1:02:40.760 --> 1:02:44.200]  know that 9-11's an inside job we're trying to get the word out to as many
[1:02:44.200 --> 1:02:48.840]  people as possible and not keep them with the wool over their eyes he does he
[1:02:48.840 --> 1:02:52.440]  need to put the Pete does mark accurately characterize the attitude of the
[1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:56.120]  trial I don't even want to dignify this with a response really I mean he knows a
[1:02:56.120 --> 1:02:59.320]  couple of Marines so therefore he knows how the veterans feel and the troops
[1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:02.360]  feel about this conflict you know our troops are just a little bit busy over
[1:03:02.360 --> 1:03:04.800]  there I don't think they're they're gonna want to take the time to open mail
[1:03:04.800 --> 1:03:09.120]  from some fringe political sect they're too busy winning this war in Iraq
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:12.880]  they're too busy decimating al-Qaeda and standing up in Iraq in Iraqi
[1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:15.440]  government they can take the fight to our enemies they're not worried about
[1:03:15.440 --> 1:03:18.240]  everything these letters are gonna find their way into the latrine and
[1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:21.840]  elsewhere they're just not really gonna care what some group in Southern
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:24.400]  California thinks about their service they know what they're doing they
[1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:28.040]  believe in it they're succeeding and frankly for him to say he's talked to a
[1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:31.360]  couple Marines you know people will think a lot of different things but I
[1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:35.800]  represent we represent 24,000 vets at vets for freedom we we believe in
[1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:38.440]  finishing this mission we believe in what we're doing and that's how most
[1:03:38.440 --> 1:03:42.320]  veterans and troops on the ground feel given that you say you care about the
[1:03:42.320 --> 1:03:46.920]  troops you say you support them given what you just heard Pete say how can you
[1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:51.200]  justify having 3,000 people send what some would argue amounts to hate mail
[1:03:51.200 --> 1:03:56.840]  to them okay we're informing them we're gonna be sending them DVDs declassified
[1:03:56.840 --> 1:04:00.440]  documents of operation northwoods where our government plan what makes you think
[1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:05.280]  they want that mark what makes you think they want a constant stream of
[1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:09.640]  propaganda why wouldn't somebody want the truth people want the facts okay the
[1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:13.360]  some the Marines are hungry for the truth what got them there why are they
[1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:17.320]  there why are they risking their lives and we're gonna help them understand
[1:04:17.320 --> 1:04:20.800]  that because you talked to a couple of Marines you believe that therefore most
[1:04:20.800 --> 1:04:24.000]  Marines and soldiers in Iraq want out and they hate what they're doing these
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.560]  are volunteers who believe in their service they believe in the mission
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:29.240]  they've been sent to do and they're achieving incredible things they're
[1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:32.760]  winning on the battlefield against al-Qaeda and Iranian back malicious total
[1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:37.400]  bull Iran is not al-Qaeda al-Qaeda is run by the criminals that run our

[1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:12.220]  right now with Dr. Jerome Corsi because we have breaking news coming up the
[1:08:12.220 --> 1:08:16.040]  next hour we went down to the governor's mansion yesterday we put out the
[1:08:16.040 --> 1:08:23.320]  call to our huge audience I would say two out of four or five listeners here
[1:08:23.320 --> 1:08:26.360]  in Austin I would say two out of four or five people in Austin are big listeners
[1:08:26.360 --> 1:08:30.240]  and support us so we have incredible coverage here over the years we have an
[1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:34.920]  inside source dealing with the governor's mansion coming up in one hour we
[1:08:34.920 --> 1:08:38.680]  also went down there and interviewed the first person to call in the fire even
[1:08:38.680 --> 1:08:42.280]  the mainstream media saying there's some type of cover-up going on that is
[1:08:42.280 --> 1:08:46.280]  coming up we know they burned down the Capitol burned part of it to rebuild it
[1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:51.880]  that's mainstream knowledge in Austin back in the 80s and the state is
[1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:55.720]  incredibly corrupt there was a stand down by the state police that is coming
[1:08:55.720 --> 1:09:01.680]  up we'll be breaking that down right now we go to Dr. Jerome Corsi doctorate

[1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:13.840]  Dr. Corsi thanks for coming on with us Alex always great pleasure my PhD by
[1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:16.600]  the way is political science from Harvard and that's right political science
[1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:20.120]  from Harvard I but I knew you worked in economics then oh I have worked in I
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:24.800]  worked in banking and finance for 25 years so I have had a lot of experience
[1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:28.240]  in international banking now I know your info meshes with the Nobel Prize winners
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:31.840]  and others we've had on all what's happening it's been I've been I cover
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:35.960]  economics I cover oil world that daily where I'm a staff reporter I cover it
[1:09:35.960 --> 1:09:41.200]  every day okay first off I was on coast to coast AM last night right after you
[1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:44.280]  were on talking about threats to my family there's new ones ladies and
[1:09:44.280 --> 1:09:47.920]  gentlemen not just the stuff that happened Sunday afternoon I want to get
[1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:53.000]  your take on these global elitist meeting and what you think about the
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:57.440]  info that we've gotten from inside their meeting about the attack on Iran
[1:09:57.440 --> 1:10:01.400]  about how they want to get the population microchipped how some of them
[1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:04.320]  now think they've raised oil prices too much that it may kill the golden goose
[1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:07.760]  the majority of them still wanting to raise oil prices do you have any take
[1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:12.560]  on the Bilderberg group well I'm gonna pick up on a story on this on the
[1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:20.520]  Federal Reserve banker this guy Timothy Gessner G E I T H N E R who just wrote
[1:10:20.520 --> 1:10:24.520]  in the Financial Times I guess he came out of the Bilderberger meeting and he's
[1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:29.640]  now writing that there's need for greater global central bank regulation
[1:10:29.640 --> 1:10:34.080]  over banking worldwide so they create the crisis offer the solution he's the
[1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:37.880]  president not the chairman Bernanke was also there of the Federal Reserve he
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:41.400]  comes out one day after we reported Saturday on a Genesis show that they
[1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:44.960]  wanted centralized banking globally exactly what we said then happened a
[1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:49.040]  day later right he came to the this is that the economic club of New York he
[1:10:49.040 --> 1:10:53.480]  gave a speech and they excerpted it published it in the Financial Times I
[1:10:53.480 --> 1:11:00.000]  guess on Monday and the speech calls directly for greater global controls
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:04.760]  talking about you know Bank of International Settlements and the
[1:11:04.760 --> 1:11:10.840]  other central banks need to have even a higher level of global control and of
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:13.600]  course it's right out of the crisis you know the financial system has been in
[1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:18.920]  crisis we've seen the meltdown and the mortgage market in the United States
[1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:22.920]  where I'm concerned there could be a meltdown and these derivatives that are
[1:11:22.920 --> 1:11:26.120]  held in the Bank of International Settlements of which there's almost
[1:11:26.120 --> 1:11:32.640]  $600 trillion of derivatives that people understand very little about and they
[1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:37.400]  are another bubble that's waiting to burst but it's it's alarming that here
[1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:41.760]  get the air is coming out of the meeting in the Bilderberger meeting and as you
[1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:47.760]  say this credit crisis the solution being proposed is to go to another level
[1:11:47.760 --> 1:11:53.280]  of global control even on top of the central banks so they are using the
[1:11:53.280 --> 1:12:00.840]  crisis as a push towards banking globalism no doubt about it well just as
[1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:03.960]  we said months ago they would do the central banks I've been arguing about
[1:12:03.960 --> 1:12:09.680]  it I wrote in the Lake rate USA that we would see the you know demise of the
[1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:14.280]  dollar that would occur as a pressure towards the regional currency the
[1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:20.080]  amaro the dollar is at its lowest point ever I mean it's it's been trading
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:24.680]  again down about a dollar fifty seven a dollar fifty eight to the euro I'll
[1:12:24.680 --> 1:12:28.880]  check it where it's at right now over talking but that's about an historical
[1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:34.760]  low point against the euro and it's it came up a little bit today dollar fifty
[1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:40.840]  four but it's been yesterday with a dollar fifty seven and the low point of
[1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:45.960]  the dollar is also one of the reasons why oil has been trading at a hundred and
[1:12:45.960 --> 1:12:49.800]  thirty eight or a hundred and thirty nine dollars a barrel because the
[1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:55.160]  commodities have been directly impacted upwards even though the central banks are
[1:12:55.160 --> 1:12:59.880]  trying to continue to depress the price of gold gold last week started trading
[1:12:59.880 --> 1:13:03.320]  above nine hundred dollars an ounce again I see today they're trying to
[1:13:03.320 --> 1:13:07.600]  depress it again is about eight hundred seventy two dollars an ounce I think the
[1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:12.400]  long-term pressures here are going to be that oil is going to be I'm saying now
[1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:18.160]  going up to I wrote it an article today and WorldNet daily I'm quoting some of
[1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:26.200]  the very top you know this is Goldman Sachs saying Goldman Sachs top analyst
[1:13:26.200 --> 1:13:30.840]  two hundred Arjan Murty saying two hundred dollars a barrel and five for
[1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:35.040]  dollars and seventy five cents a gallon now this guy Murty who's a thirty nine
[1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:39.720]  year old is one of the top energy analysts at Goldman Sachs he's been
[1:13:39.720 --> 1:13:44.160]  driving the markets because he's been predicting higher oil prices now this
[1:13:44.160 --> 1:13:48.440]  is another pressure I don't see stopping I mean if you have Murty is saying in
[1:13:48.440 --> 1:13:54.000]  Goldman Sachs two hundred dollar a barrel per oil likely over the next six to
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:59.560]  twenty four months so it happened within the next six months and Murty is
[1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:04.720]  saying he's not a peak oil theorist he does not believe that the oil is running
[1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:08.800]  out he's not one of those guys that things were running out of oil worldwide
[1:14:08.800 --> 1:14:12.560]  yeah total artificial scarcity scam that's what it is you've written a book on
[1:14:12.560 --> 1:14:16.720]  the subject and he is well I wrote black gold stranglehold and I've argued that
[1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:19.960]  this was the kind of manipulation that you get in these boxes I want to stop you
[1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:24.240]  Dr. Corsi that's the key we have people on this show whose predictions all come
[1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:30.440]  true we bring you Ron Paul Dr. Corsi we bring you Dr. Joseph Stiglitz former
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:33.320]  Chief Economist World Bank a Nobel Prize winner we bring you the head of the
[1:14:33.320 --> 1:14:37.200]  New York Business School we bring you people whose predictions all come true
[1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:42.240]  I wish you were wrong doctor talk about the ramifications of five dollar and
[1:14:42.240 --> 1:14:46.840]  seventy-five cent a gallon gasoline what will that do in the ripple effect
[1:14:46.840 --> 1:14:50.920]  there's a lot of people I hear say well I'm a hippie I only ride a bicycle they
[1:14:50.920 --> 1:14:54.960]  don't understand that will affect everybody it'll be huge effect this is
[1:14:54.960 --> 1:15:01.680]  like a change in in the phenomenon that it's like a whole new world I mean for
[1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:05.520]  it at five dollars and seventy-five cents a gallon even today at over four
[1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:11.520]  dollars a gallon food is delivered by trucks energy prices and impact almost
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:17.000]  everything we eat or consume or air conditioning up Erica the travel
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:21.480]  industry air conditioning it's all but you know quality of life issues
[1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:26.160]  refrigeration all energy all other energy driven and it really isn't based on
[1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:29.880]  dollar devaluation isn't that the largest that's reason but the dollar
[1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:34.320]  devaluation is the major change in the market I mean if you look back ago a
[1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:39.440]  year to 18 months we have oil at fifty seven dollars a barrel today it's double
[1:15:39.440 --> 1:15:43.000]  that easily it's now at a hundred thirty eight thirty nine dollars a barrel today
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:47.560]  is trading at a hundred thirty four point fifty a barrel and that's these are
[1:15:47.560 --> 1:15:51.560]  prices that are way in excess of the amount that demand is increased in that
[1:15:51.560 --> 1:15:56.480]  period of time and we have all the big SUV plants all the big SUV plants are
[1:15:56.480 --> 1:16:00.120]  announcing shut down well it changes everybody style of life because
[1:16:00.120 --> 1:16:04.720]  immediately their families have to make decisions now between filling up their
[1:16:04.720 --> 1:16:09.600]  gas tanks and buying groceries for the family there are our families that are
[1:16:09.600 --> 1:16:14.000]  not going to be able to live any kind of a middle-class lifestyle air
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:17.040]  conditioning is going to be going to heating when we get into the winter
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:24.160]  going to become problematic traveling anywhere of the air travel industry air
[1:16:24.160 --> 1:16:28.600]  industry the airlines are virtually in crisis they don't know how to survive
[1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:33.560]  at these kinds of prices prices they're all consolidating or reducing
[1:16:33.560 --> 1:16:38.240]  staff they can't increase tickets that they start increasing tickets to cover
[1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:43.760]  oil at a hundred thirty five dollars a barrel no one will be able to fly well
[1:16:43.760 --> 1:16:47.120]  Dr. Corsi let me just give you some on the ground stuff I flew Southwest to
[1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:52.840]  Virginia to cover DC and back and both the flight there and back were delayed
[1:16:52.840 --> 1:16:57.200]  over an hour and a half most the other flights were delayed I've never seen it
[1:16:57.200 --> 1:17:00.600]  unless it's bad weather and it wasn't delayed delayed delayed delayed delayed
[1:17:00.600 --> 1:17:05.200]  on the boards the Southwest woman we were everybody was just talking waiting
[1:17:05.200 --> 1:17:08.680]  for the plane to come she started screaming at us saying shut up shut up I
[1:17:08.680 --> 1:17:12.800]  want to talk to you she ordered everybody to stand up an hour early to get up
[1:17:12.800 --> 1:17:15.720]  before the plane even arrived when people didn't do it she screamed at
[1:17:15.720 --> 1:17:19.080]  everybody and told him to do it I noticed they were screaming at people at
[1:17:19.080 --> 1:17:23.440]  other things the toilet was stinking and overflowing in the plane the
[1:17:23.440 --> 1:17:28.360]  stewardesses were griping at everybody I mean I was seeing palpable panic by the
[1:17:28.360 --> 1:17:32.720]  airport personnel well this is a crisis and and the you're gonna see it
[1:17:32.720 --> 1:17:39.120]  reflected in airline employees because staffs are being cut across the board
[1:17:39.120 --> 1:17:42.640]  people are being asked to do jobs that are two or three times more difficult
[1:17:42.640 --> 1:17:46.960]  they're not even pumping the toilets out once a day surprise it I wouldn't
[1:17:46.960 --> 1:17:52.160]  surprise me at all in applying today is going to become very problematic they're
[1:17:52.160 --> 1:17:55.320]  going to cancel flights if they don't have them full there's going to be a lot
[1:17:55.320 --> 1:17:59.080]  of problems and scheduling are there's going to be difficulties in terms of
[1:17:59.080 --> 1:18:03.520]  pricing you'll be lucky to get any service at all today is a fly if you
[1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:07.880]  have to environment it's going to get worse and I had to fly I mean it was a
[1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:12.400]  wreaking sewage plant that I was flying on well that's going to become more
[1:18:12.400 --> 1:18:16.680]  common and I'm concerned about safety problems in terms of airplane
[1:18:16.680 --> 1:18:19.880]  maintenance that's the next thing that's going to become problem well they
[1:18:19.880 --> 1:18:23.120]  admit it's come out that a bunch of companies are getting in major trouble
[1:18:23.120 --> 1:18:26.520]  because the maintenance just isn't being done well and but you know what's
[1:18:26.520 --> 1:18:30.320]  happened to me is what I look at I predicted when I wrote black gold
[1:18:30.320 --> 1:18:34.680]  stranglehold with Craig Smith we published that in 2005 we published that
[1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:38.640]  we said oil was going to be at $100 a barrel and everybody said we were nuts
[1:18:38.640 --> 1:18:44.120]  well today oil at $135 a barrel got Goldman Sachs saying it's going to go
[1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:51.320]  as high as $200 a barrel and I'm saying I'm looking at a dollar 45 to $145 to
[1:18:51.320 --> 1:18:57.040]  $150 a barrel being right around the corner and the pressures on this are
[1:18:57.040 --> 1:19:03.240]  largely speculation there's the drop in the value of the dollar so people want
[1:19:03.240 --> 1:19:08.440]  to have more hard currency they're dumping out into real assets and right
[1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:13.600]  exactly so oil is a hard asset it's a commodity and to sell the oil they want
[1:19:13.600 --> 1:19:19.160]  $135 that these worthless dollars and also you've got the speculators taking
[1:19:19.160 --> 1:19:23.240]  advantage of that and it's getting priced into it I'm increasingly convinced
[1:19:23.240 --> 1:19:26.920]  that they're pricing into it a war in the Middle East I think they're pricing
[1:19:26.920 --> 1:19:31.480]  into it a war with Iran before push leaves off I want to hear about that when
[1:19:31.480 --> 1:19:34.720]  we get back what you think's going on with Iran then I'm gonna get into how
[1:19:34.720 --> 1:19:39.480]  NPR and others at Bragg the Bilderberg group wanted to get $200 a barrel oil
[1:19:39.480 --> 1:19:42.240]  they bragged they were gonna do this quote to teach us not to consume so much
[1:19:42.240 --> 1:19:46.440]  this is the new environmentalism you're seeing artificially creating scarcity
[1:19:46.440 --> 1:19:50.320]  you want to be third-world slaves you are that goes for all you that serve the

[1:21:04.440 --> 1:21:09.400]  annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years the US economy receives its

[1:21:12.920 --> 1:21:18.440]  federal reserve system in the year 2000 debt growth collapse to only 4.5% it's
[1:21:18.440 --> 1:21:22.280]  bad enough that the US citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce

[1:24:35.160 --> 1:24:40.000]  implosion the world doesn't want them here domestically they still have some
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:46.760]  value but overnight that could erode its slow erosion is now accelerating all by
[1:24:46.760 --> 1:24:52.920]  design we told you two years ago build a bird 2006 with our spies inside and some
[1:24:52.920 --> 1:24:56.640]  of their minions people that work for them we have multiple sources at great
[1:24:56.640 --> 1:25:01.120]  danger to themselves I mean Tucker to meet with them I'll have to change cars
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:05.480]  go through shopping malls get with other people we've got video of that we've got
[1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:10.840]  sources that they plan to have it at $200 a barrel within three years that they
[1:25:10.840 --> 1:25:14.840]  plan to have it at $240 a barrel by this summer that's in my film in game it's
[1:25:14.840 --> 1:25:21.480]  been out for nine months footage we shot two years ago they run things folks what
[1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:25.440]  they say they get they artificially want to squeeze us they artificially want to
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:29.000]  have you so poor you can't take care of yourself or defend yourself when they
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:32.520]  see PS your children or send you to prison for no reason they're hiring more
[1:25:32.520 --> 1:25:37.560]  and more cops on a broke back economy outriding tickets I was just talking to
[1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:41.240]  Weldon Henson went to visit some of his military buddies in Florida this weekend
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:45.600]  he said Southwest they were screaming at him in the terminals searching old men
[1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:50.520]  screaming at people on the plane see the same thing it's unraveling as the
[1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:54.680]  dollar implodes as they slash staff you're gonna see this everywhere Dr.
[1:25:54.680 --> 1:26:00.600]  Corsig well that's exactly right Alex you've got the dollar crisis is not gonna
[1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:04.840]  end anytime soon I mean the dollar has been in crisis now for two years and
[1:26:04.840 --> 1:26:10.960]  it's worsening I said the lowest points ever against the euro the dollar is in
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:15.120]  terms of commodities it's one of the major reasons why oil has gone up so much
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:19.440]  in price and the media and the media will never say the main reason no one
[1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:23.760]  talks about it's the dollar it's a big secret it can't figure out why because
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:29.160]  it's obvious demand has not gone up this dramatically if China's coming online
[1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:33.200]  and needing more energy India is needing more energy we've known this for ten
[1:26:33.200 --> 1:26:38.800]  years and there's still ample supply I mean the supply has not been disrupted
[1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:42.240]  of the major oil companies the international companies have all the
[1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:46.040]  oil reserves they could possibly need they're just training us for the new
[1:26:46.040 --> 1:26:50.440]  way of life well and with the the manipulation of the price of oil right
[1:26:50.440 --> 1:26:55.280]  now which is clearly manipulation it's caused by the dollar being weaker and
[1:26:55.280 --> 1:27:00.680]  the increased speculation and I'm confident it's pricing into a concern
[1:27:00.680 --> 1:27:04.960]  about a war with Iran I think the rhetoric on Iran is ramping up again
[1:27:04.960 --> 1:27:08.200]  and I'm pretty determined the Bush administration is going to take take a
[1:27:08.200 --> 1:27:14.160]  hard look at a war with Iran before up even possibly before the election
[1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:18.360]  certainly before the end of the Bush administration well let me give you the
[1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:22.280]  inside scoop double confirmed actually trouble confirmed secretary defense
[1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:26.600]  Gates was there for multiple days at Bilderberg and Chantilly Virginia the
[1:27:26.600 --> 1:27:30.960]  Westfields Marriott and he said that we all you to support it we're going in
[1:27:30.960 --> 1:27:35.840]  Europe said we're not going to support you any and they basically made noises
[1:27:35.840 --> 1:27:40.200]  that they're probably going to hit well I think you've got it's the scenario
[1:27:40.200 --> 1:27:46.120]  that I wrote it in atomic Iran you know again published in 2005 I wrote it again
[1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:49.680]  in the showdown with nuclear Iran second book I published in Iran was that
[1:27:49.680 --> 1:27:54.200]  Israel would come to a point where they couldn't wait any longer just like with
[1:27:54.200 --> 1:27:58.800]  this strike in Syria of the nuclear plant that was being built by the North
[1:27:58.800 --> 1:28:03.760]  Koreans which just happened a few months ago I think it's a Samson option
[1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:09.000]  Israel comes to a point where they're not gonna take the risk that Ahmadinejad
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:14.680]  and Iran will have enough uranium refined to be able to make one or more
[1:28:14.680 --> 1:28:18.360]  weapons doc I agree with you on almost everything you say until we get into this
[1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:23.200]  whole World War 3 thing are you saying you really believe that Israel is
[1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:26.960]  threatened when it's got 400 nukes and Iran doesn't even have one and the CIA's
[1:28:26.960 --> 1:28:31.040]  on assessment says they're years away from it well I don't think I think for
[1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:36.600]  the Israel's point of view with Ahmadinejad threatening so constantly
[1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:42.000]  and saying that he wants Israel gone he wants Israel eliminated well he said if
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:47.160]  they attack him today that they're going to strike back well he gets he said
[1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:55.040]  today the defense minister it was this was on now Mustafa Muhammad Najjar at a
[1:28:55.040 --> 1:28:59.960]  news conference he said basically when it went when they're saying this coming
[1:28:59.960 --> 1:29:05.440]  from it's going back and forth the minister in Iran said basically they
[1:29:05.440 --> 1:29:10.320]  would retaliate of attack and the Israeli transport minister who is shawl
[1:29:10.320 --> 1:29:17.360]  mofad said that it looked like an attack on Iran was unavoidable so you know I
[1:29:17.360 --> 1:29:20.440]  think you're getting the pressure building up in Israel for an attack on
[1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:25.160]  Iran and Iran is poised for it and it will retaliate okay I want to break down
[1:29:25.160 --> 1:29:29.360]  what you think I predicted yeah I want to hear what you think's gonna unfold and
[1:29:29.360 --> 1:29:33.240]  when and what the repercussions will be militarily economically societally
[1:29:33.240 --> 1:29:41.360]  daughters are of course a long segment coming up your phone calls as well stay with us we're

[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:47.560]  quick now doctor continuing with your analysis I mean where do you stand on a
[1:37:47.560 --> 1:37:52.120]  war I mean I've been hearing you on air I mean you're you're a argue against Israel
[1:37:52.120 --> 1:37:56.440]  attacking Iran I mean are you opposed to any kind of a war against Iran I don't
[1:37:56.440 --> 1:38:00.680]  think a war with Iran is going to solve the problem I predicted in both of the
[1:38:00.680 --> 1:38:04.960]  books I wrote going back to atomic Iran the war would happen that does not mean
[1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:09.440]  I'm in favor of it I predicted that Israel would attack and I've always
[1:38:09.440 --> 1:38:13.880]  predicted that Israel would get to this point where they wouldn't know if Iran
[1:38:13.880 --> 1:38:18.280]  could produce a nuclear weapon once they think it's it's possible they'll attack
[1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:22.720]  and I predicted that the United States will support Israel that attack even
[1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:29.000]  though we won't initiate it I think it'll be a disastrous war a disastrous
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:32.680]  expansion of violence in the Middle East in the Middle East I've said for a long
[1:38:32.680 --> 1:38:37.600]  time that war is the problem it's not the solution I'll rubine managed to
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:40.880]  convince me of that and his wife lay a rubine and managed to convince me of
[1:38:40.880 --> 1:38:46.200]  that after rubine's death if every death in the Middle East another another
[1:38:46.200 --> 1:38:50.960]  generation of revenge and violence is perpetuated it won't solve any problem
[1:38:50.960 --> 1:38:56.160]  and we've got troops in the area the Shahab 3 missile that Iran has is more
[1:38:56.160 --> 1:39:01.000]  than capable of killing thousands of US troops even with conventional warheads
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  and the war there is not it's not a video game it's not like we're going to
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:09.840]  send in our planes and missiles and hit the sites and it's going to be over in
[1:39:09.840 --> 1:39:15.560]  24 hours that's not reality reality is a war with Iran is a very big difficult
[1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:21.040]  war that won't end quickly and might not end successfully and it's a bad idea
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:24.400]  because it will perpetuate more generations of violence they're also
[1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:29.040]  talking about they're also talking about $500 a barrel oil if that happens
[1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:35.040]  well it's possible I mean I think that the $200 a barrel that we're looking at
[1:39:35.040 --> 1:39:40.840]  that you know Goldman Sachs says is the next horizon I'm saying $155 a barrel
[1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:45.160]  I think it's already starting to price in the likelihood of a war because you've
[1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:49.360]  got increasing statements coming out of Israel saying you know the old merit
[1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:53.880]  government's in trouble it could on scandals internal into the country you
[1:39:53.880 --> 1:39:58.680]  could have the old merit government fall any day got Netanyahu in the wings of
[1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:03.480]  Netanyahu takes over he's going to be in a much more hawkish position against
[1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:08.080]  Iran and President Bush is leaving office I'm not sure he's going to leave
[1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:13.480]  office without trying to settle the problem in Iran he sees it I think if
[1:40:13.480 --> 1:40:18.800]  there's any provocation or it could be created even a provocation of a Tonkin
[1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:23.440]  golf kind of incident which I've worried about with these you know these boats
[1:40:23.440 --> 1:40:27.920]  that the Iran has out of the Gulf and that turned out to be staged fake audio
[1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:32.200]  transmissions the whole thing turned out to be a nothing event let's be clear
[1:40:32.200 --> 1:40:36.520]  you're saying that Israel or the elements of the United States could stage an
[1:40:36.520 --> 1:40:40.480]  event as a pretext for war I worry about it it could happen but we did it in the
[1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:45.440]  Tonkin golf of the staged incident the whole it's now been declassified NSA
[1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:50.560]  that Israel knowingly attacked USS Liberty and look if you any incident
[1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:56.240]  manufactured or otherwise could easily escalate to cause a war with Iran it
[1:40:56.240 --> 1:41:00.960]  would be a terror a disastrous mistake but the same point of view you've got
[1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:07.240]  Iran continuing not to listen to the world pressure even offers to accept
[1:41:07.240 --> 1:41:13.200]  uranium from Russia and today you see on drudge with President Bush in Europe
[1:41:13.200 --> 1:41:17.440]  he's asking the European Union to step up sanctions and put additional pressure
[1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:22.400]  even to the point of you know cutting Iran off from the world banking system
[1:41:22.400 --> 1:41:29.240]  now steps like that were taken I think this can escalate very quickly and if
[1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:33.680]  it does escalate and go into a military direction Alex is unpredictable
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:38.160]  because you've got the Russians supporting Iran they've sold the very
[1:41:38.160 --> 1:41:42.800]  sophisticated surface-to-air missile systems to Iran Iran has put around their
[1:41:42.800 --> 1:41:50.440]  nuclear installations China is in oil and natural gas deals with Iran both
[1:41:50.440 --> 1:41:54.360]  China and Russia have asked Iran to consider joining the Shanghai
[1:41:54.360 --> 1:41:59.800]  cooperation League I don't think Russia is going to sit by Italy and watch the
[1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:04.360]  United States and Israel militarily destroy Iran let's set that aside for a
[1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:08.920]  moment let's say Russia and China don't get involved Iran is 65 million people
[1:42:08.920 --> 1:42:13.560]  not 21 million like Iraq it is still an industrialized nation not after you know
[1:42:13.560 --> 1:42:19.120]  12 14 years of bombardment before it was taken over they have tens of thousands
[1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:23.760]  of missiles that can hit any of the US globalist controlled ships in the Gulf
[1:42:23.760 --> 1:42:29.440]  we have all of this happening and we know the Iranians are going to sink a
[1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:32.800]  bunch of ships there in the channels blocking up the oil they've said they'll
[1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:37.080]  do that they said that they're going to then attack our forces and again I need
[1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:41.320]  to be clear but now control the globalist in Iraq they're going to turn
[1:42:41.320 --> 1:42:46.520]  the Shiites completely loose Iraq is going to descend into bedlam we have
[1:42:46.520 --> 1:42:49.960]  the different battle plans from Israel and the US it's Seihersh and others have
[1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:54.360]  released the Pentagon admits are accurate between 150 and 3000 targets
[1:42:54.360 --> 1:42:58.200]  depending on which plan being hit blowing up their Navy tens of thousands of
[1:42:58.200 --> 1:43:01.560]  Saudis over several months bombing all their infrastructure water treatment
[1:43:01.560 --> 1:43:06.200]  roads anything that quote could aid military all their research facilities
[1:43:06.200 --> 1:43:10.000]  are talking about you is using bunker busters they say if Iran fights back in
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:15.120]  any way then tactical nukes may be used I mean we're talking about total
[1:43:15.120 --> 1:43:20.160]  insanity and we're talking about the US is stock dropping even further this will
[1:43:20.160 --> 1:43:24.480]  definitely bring the world into a global depression and it will accelerate
[1:43:24.480 --> 1:43:29.600]  the inflationary spiral that's my view your view dr. Corsi well I've been
[1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:36.120]  totally opposed to it you remember in 2005 Alex I walked 200 miles with the
[1:43:36.120 --> 1:43:42.040]  Iranian ex-patriot after I wrote atomic Iran we walked from the Liberty Bell to
[1:43:42.040 --> 1:43:47.400]  Washington DC and I was urging at that time the support for the Iranian ex-
[1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:51.240]  patriot is over a million of them in the United States and the freedom fighters
[1:43:51.240 --> 1:43:56.360]  within Iran who want to change their own country if we supported the freedom
[1:43:56.360 --> 1:44:01.280]  fighters you could have like you saw the orange revolution in the Ukraine or we
[1:44:01.280 --> 1:44:06.520]  stopped apartheid in South Africa velvet revolution there's other ways to have
[1:44:06.520 --> 1:44:11.600]  political change affected in the world that war let me bring this up to you
[1:44:11.600 --> 1:44:16.440]  like well what the Iranians to do it themselves I don't want to dictate or
[1:44:16.440 --> 1:44:20.880]  see the United States try to dictate what should happen in Iran now Sy
[1:44:20.880 --> 1:44:26.520]  Hirsh again we reported this before he did but it's now been confirmed reported
[1:44:26.520 --> 1:44:31.480]  four years ago that known Wahhabi groups out of Saudi Arabia that have also been
[1:44:31.480 --> 1:44:35.600]  attacking US troops have now been hired by the US and I talked to a colonel this
[1:44:35.600 --> 1:44:39.040]  weekend who was admitting it that they're using quote the number three in
[1:44:39.040 --> 1:44:43.040]  al-Qaeda to command one of the forces bombing police stations blowing up
[1:44:43.040 --> 1:44:46.080]  mosque the Iranians have been sitting there taking that in the White House
[1:44:46.080 --> 1:44:49.840]  last year put out a press release and said yes we are backing quote these
[1:44:49.840 --> 1:44:54.120]  Mujahideen groups well those Mujahideen groups are Wahhabi al-Qaeda and then
[1:44:54.120 --> 1:44:59.760]  then and then we've got McCain and others and and Betraya's coming out and
[1:44:59.760 --> 1:45:04.240]  saying that Iran is running al-Qaeda now that is asinine for our criminal
[1:45:04.240 --> 1:45:07.880]  government to be running known al-Qaeda groups known Wahhabi is against the Shiite
[1:45:07.880 --> 1:45:12.120]  government of Iran and then to have the media double back and claim Iran is al-
[1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:16.600]  qaeda your take well again I think these are I can't prove any of the things you're
[1:45:16.600 --> 1:45:20.600]  talking about here I haven't researched them or reported on them myself what I
[1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:25.480]  am concerned about they have reported on that the difficulties in terms of
[1:45:25.480 --> 1:45:31.000]  Pakistan I think we could easily expand the war into Pakistan going into this
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:35.800]  northwestern section of Pakistan where our intelligence agencies believe Osama
[1:45:35.800 --> 1:45:40.680]  bin Laden is still hiding I'm also concerned that you know with regards to
[1:45:40.680 --> 1:45:47.320]  the ethnic issues you've you've got within you know both Iraq and Iran are not
[1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:54.000]  just Asunis and Shiites you've got the Kurds in the northern part of both Iraq
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:46:00.160]  and Iran and you've had both Turkish and Iranian violence against the Kurds
[1:46:00.160 --> 1:46:04.840]  both in Iran and in Iraq that's because also I'm not getting in I'm not
[1:46:04.840 --> 1:46:07.960]  picking sides here you know the Kurds been running around killing the police
[1:46:07.960 --> 1:46:13.080]  and military of Turkey we before we don't eat not picking sides I'm just
[1:46:13.080 --> 1:46:16.400]  saying that there's an ethnic element to this as well the Kurds want to
[1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:21.640]  establish Kurdistan and you could very easily have the United States expand the
[1:46:21.640 --> 1:46:25.960]  violence into Iran and this is how World War one or World War two started is very
[1:46:25.960 --> 1:46:31.160]  similar these are the kinds of conflict conflicts and you know one thing leads to
[1:46:31.160 --> 1:46:35.960]  another that the triggered World War one okay listen doctor I want to get back
[1:46:35.960 --> 1:46:41.080]  into some of the things having economically we've all heard NPR all
[1:46:41.080 --> 1:46:44.520]  heard the quote liberals brag about how soon Americans won't have the same
[1:46:44.520 --> 1:46:48.520]  standard of living we deserve to not have oil we deserve to be controlled we
[1:46:48.520 --> 1:46:51.960]  deserve to stop consuming so much that's the whole point of their fake global
[1:46:51.960 --> 1:46:57.480]  carbon tax that both McCain and Obama are supporting the people don't support it
[1:46:57.480 --> 1:47:01.920]  they don't care we now see what is happening I want to point out this
[1:47:01.920 --> 1:47:06.360]  economic system we're seeing unfold is by design a do you concur be where do
[1:47:06.360 --> 1:47:10.320]  you see it going well I argue that I argued like great USA that we would see
[1:47:10.320 --> 1:47:15.360]  the dollar drop but we would see a major recession hit again because it would
[1:47:15.360 --> 1:47:19.680]  push us into a solution which would be a North American Union one of the major
[1:47:19.680 --> 1:47:24.880]  themes of the lake great USA what is he happening right now is that you know look
[1:47:24.880 --> 1:47:30.640]  the stock market headed back towards 12,000 we twice now recent months within
[1:47:30.640 --> 1:47:35.520]  the last year or 18 months traded under 12,000 I think we're going to start
[1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:40.480]  trading under 12,000 again a stock market today is struggling to gain 50
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:45.680]  points as we're talking it's been losing all day from the from its high I
[1:47:45.680 --> 1:47:49.960]  think oil is going to increase in value in price and the dollar is going to
[1:47:49.960 --> 1:47:55.000]  continue to drop I think these are manipulated crises there's abundant
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:48:00.360]  oil in the world I've argued like great USA that it's abiotic it's not created
[1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:04.880]  by that's not even arguable it's absolutely a scientific fact it's just
[1:48:04.880 --> 1:48:08.280]  the public so dumb down they don't know it and we you know we're finding as
[1:48:08.280 --> 1:48:12.600]  predicted by the abiotic theory we're finding deep earth oil well more than
[1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:18.200]  that finding to Brazil yeah well they're finding 16,000 foot deep wells in
[1:48:18.200 --> 1:48:22.720]  Texas mega wells the old the old wells are also filling back up well no
[1:48:22.720 --> 1:48:26.120]  question about it they've been capped wells all through the United States that
[1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:30.040]  today could be not only because the technology improved but to some extent
[1:48:30.040 --> 1:48:35.520]  they've repunished but you've got wells at deep levels that you know are far
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:39.720]  below where our geologists would ever look and natural gas abundant natural gas
[1:48:39.720 --> 1:48:43.640]  and let me just add because I have a family that works in the oil fields they
[1:48:43.640 --> 1:48:48.880]  are hitting 15 14 16,000 deep wells in each Texas that are big their spindle
[1:48:48.880 --> 1:48:53.680]  top I mean we're talking about millions of cubic feet of gas a day each well
[1:48:53.680 --> 1:48:57.440]  tens of thousands of barrels a week I mean these these deep wells are mega
[1:48:57.440 --> 1:49:03.080]  huge just go to deep track that's TRK deep track it's part of the US Department
[1:49:03.080 --> 1:49:07.160]  of Energy's website and they document abundant natural gas three miles below
[1:49:07.160 --> 1:49:11.760]  the surface of the earth in the continental United States also unconventional
[1:49:11.760 --> 1:49:16.520]  oil they'll go back to the Fisher Trops processes that were developed by the
[1:49:16.520 --> 1:49:21.600]  chemists in Weimar Germany and that the Nazis used to produce oil oil out of
[1:49:21.600 --> 1:49:27.240]  coal we've got oil shale we've got the oil Tars which are up in Alberta Canada
[1:49:27.240 --> 1:49:32.280]  there's hundreds of years of oil in those two resources alone got the
[1:49:32.280 --> 1:49:37.440]  bracken field now in Montana and South Dakota which even the US Geological
[1:49:37.440 --> 1:49:42.440]  Service has validated don't have 150 million barrels of recoverable reserves
[1:49:42.440 --> 1:49:47.320]  but somewhere between 3.4 and 4 billion barrels let's be clear we are
[1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:51.520]  swimming in oil there's plenty of it but and and the Congress is blaming the
[1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:54.920]  oil companies who have shut down a lot of refineries we have their own memos but
[1:49:54.920 --> 1:49:59.440]  they are small players in the fraud it is the fact that yeah the big oil
[1:49:59.440 --> 1:50:02.800]  companies and governments are not allowing its extraction and I would
[1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:07.320]  I'll demand that the oil companies stop operating as international oligopoly
[1:50:07.320 --> 1:50:12.240]  they're sitting on supply we've got to change the tax incentives and really
[1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:15.800]  think hard about these international oil companies that's right or they're
[1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:19.360]  gonna fully destroy the global economy which is in their advantage they're
[1:50:19.360 --> 1:50:23.560]  doing it to get the price of oil as high as they can get it at this point but
[1:50:23.560 --> 1:50:27.760]  we'd I'd say let's think creatively about states I think South Dakota voted
[1:50:27.760 --> 1:50:33.120]  to put a refinery and let's give tax breaks to states that put refineries in
[1:50:33.120 --> 1:50:37.800]  hell how about they pay no taxes let's get the oil companies to have only tax
[1:50:37.800 --> 1:50:41.600]  incentives if they increase supply absolutely dr. course you stay with me
[1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:44.760]  for this segment and one more because I want to get to the collars on the other
[1:50:44.760 --> 1:50:48.040]  side as new books coming out on the Barack Obama let me talk to him during
[1:50:48.040 --> 1:50:50.840]  the break see if I can even hold even longer

[1:55:10.840 --> 1:55:16.480]  believe corrupt politicians and I you know I shot them down for their bad
[1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:22.200]  policies and immediately the week after you know my home gets broken into I
[1:55:22.200 --> 1:55:26.160]  received threatening phone calls all these things I'm doing everything I can

[1:55:50.200 --> 1:55:55.720]  Corsi about that he probably doesn't know your story but dr. Corsi things are
[1:55:55.720 --> 1:55:59.560]  the government's just going so criminal I mean everything the corruption is
[1:55:59.560 --> 1:56:04.840]  just getting worse and worse and worse now what's happening what is the story
[1:56:04.840 --> 1:56:11.160]  about in a nutshell tell him what happened well long story short I'm
[1:56:11.160 --> 1:56:14.560]  running for office I'm an underdog candidate with no money been doing this
[1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:18.480]  out of my house and I've been watching Alex for years and just got inspired to
[1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:21.440]  do something about so I decided you know run for office and stick up for you
[1:56:21.440 --> 1:56:27.200]  know true non neocon principles and long story short I I get on the live TV
[1:56:27.200 --> 1:56:31.240]  debate here in ory county and you know I shoot these guys down for you know
[1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:36.040]  taking funds from organizations and the companies that hire illegal immigrants
[1:56:36.040 --> 1:56:41.080]  just I believe on American principles well the weekend of iris get I get
[1:56:41.080 --> 1:56:47.240]  threatening phone calls and my I my wife calls me one night says that that my
[1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:51.680]  house has been broken into I drive down there to make sure she's okay I get in
[1:56:51.680 --> 1:56:55.520]  the house turn on all the lights in the middle of our floor is a smiley face
[1:56:55.520 --> 1:57:00.720]  someone broke into our house and drew a smiley face and and all the signs that
[1:57:00.720 --> 1:57:05.440]  I've been making my hand I made about six or seven maybe maybe ten by now but
[1:57:05.440 --> 1:57:08.400]  they were all gone and there was only one now I put them out there I'm gonna
[1:57:08.400 --> 1:57:11.440]  have to get you back on for the full story later I appreciate it we'll get in
[1:57:11.440 --> 1:57:14.960]  contact have you on sir but let me just say this that's my point there's a lot
[1:57:14.960 --> 1:57:18.440]  of money sucking off government you've got little corrupt systems everywhere
[1:57:18.440 --> 1:57:22.880]  dr. Corsi comments well you know I don't know the whole story so it's hard to
[1:57:22.880 --> 1:57:27.280]  comment on it but I've been you know clearly it sounds like the harassment
[1:57:27.280 --> 1:57:32.520]  that is unacceptable I've got another story that I wrote world until today I'm
[1:57:32.520 --> 1:57:37.760]  following how many of the statistics the government is quitting to publish the
[1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:40.720]  government's just announced they're not going to publish reports any longer on
[1:57:40.720 --> 1:57:44.440]  foreign investment in the United States the whole series of reports that are
[1:57:44.440 --> 1:57:49.040]  going to be discontinued and I put that together with the same way the
[1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:54.160]  government quit reporting M3 data which is the money supply data quick
[1:57:54.160 --> 1:57:58.760]  reporting that just before the Fed pumped huge amounts of liquidity into the
[1:57:58.760 --> 1:58:05.120]  banking system M3 is that is growing at like 16% right now I think this means
[1:58:05.120 --> 1:58:08.720]  that they're the you know Bush administration is getting ready for a
[1:58:08.720 --> 1:58:13.200]  whole wave of foreign investment in here to buy banks and corporate assets and
[1:58:13.200 --> 1:58:16.560]  not reported to the American people that's why they are handing the entire
[1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:20.880]  country over they will suck it dry and leave a rear guard of paramilitary death

[2:00:09.960 --> 2:00:18.760]  really funny the Dr. Corsi just brought up how the Department of Commerce and
[2:00:18.760 --> 2:00:22.360]  others are not gonna put out reports anymore about ports being taken over
[2:00:22.360 --> 2:00:26.160]  infrastructure roads by foreign companies now that we're gonna be like the
[2:00:26.160 --> 2:00:29.640]  peso with the dollar they can just come in and buy everything it's it's over I
[2:00:29.640 --> 2:00:33.520]  mean literally I've been telling you this for years this is them imploding
[2:00:33.520 --> 2:00:37.560]  us this is them blowing us out to get us this is the IMF World Bank plan I've
[2:00:37.560 --> 2:00:42.840]  been covering and panic since 2002 I got another late notice from the
[2:00:42.840 --> 2:00:47.200]  Department of the Census and under the law I spent two hours last night
[2:00:47.200 --> 2:00:50.240]  reading and I've you just got to tell them how people live in your house you
[2:00:50.240 --> 2:00:53.880]  don't have to answer the business questions unless you're a big global
[2:00:53.880 --> 2:00:58.800]  corporation engaged in mining or interstate commerce and I went and read
[2:00:58.800 --> 2:01:02.280]  all the laws I knew the laws but I wanted to double check it it's not true it's
[2:01:02.280 --> 2:01:05.840]  just made up lies and they say yeah every month you're gonna have to answer all
[2:01:05.840 --> 2:01:10.080]  these hundreds of questions for us and file reports under perjury and you have
[2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:13.440]  to waive your fifth amendment when but but if you don't do this will arrest you
[2:01:13.440 --> 2:01:18.080]  and fine you and you go read it and that's not what it says that the
[2:01:18.080 --> 2:01:23.880]  government is completely criminal bankrupt but meanwhile foreigners who've
[2:01:23.880 --> 2:01:27.120]  always had to tell what they're buying what they're doing who they're what
[2:01:27.120 --> 2:01:31.400]  politicians they're talking to I mean it's like John McCain he went to England
[2:01:31.400 --> 2:01:34.280]  met with the Rothschilds made hundreds of thousands of dollars at a campaign
[2:01:34.280 --> 2:01:37.920]  meeting it was admitted to be totally illegal and the feds just said we're
[2:01:37.920 --> 2:01:44.000]  doing nothing Dr. Corsi I mean it's lawlessness it scares me and frightens
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:47.960]  me when the government decides not to publish certain statistics I mean the
[2:01:47.960 --> 2:01:54.560]  the nature of not publishing data on the foreign investment in the United
[2:01:54.560 --> 2:01:58.520]  States showing the amount where it comes from what kind of companies they're
[2:01:58.520 --> 2:02:04.280]  buying friends just like not publishing M3 data on the money supply there's only
[2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:08.400]  one reason not to publish the data that's because government intends to do
[2:02:08.400 --> 2:02:11.800]  something they don't want people knowing about and I'll tell you what worries me
[2:02:11.800 --> 2:02:14.720]  I'll tell you what worries me the fact that they're breaking all the laws
[2:02:14.720 --> 2:02:18.400]  getting so criminal means they're gonna go for broke total police state I mean
[2:02:18.400 --> 2:02:22.520]  they're acting like nothing's gonna stop them and they just don't care well
[2:02:22.520 --> 2:02:26.800]  certainly the pressure that you see right now on the dollar and you know with
[2:02:26.800 --> 2:02:31.480]  oil the commodity price is increasing so dramatically this is gonna build to a
[2:02:31.480 --> 2:02:37.200]  crisis point that you mean it's $4 a gallon people are feeling pain but at
[2:02:37.200 --> 2:02:41.960]  $5 a gallon I think people are gonna be feeling economic distress to the point
[2:02:41.960 --> 2:02:45.880]  where they can't function they won't be able to go to work and earn enough to
[2:02:45.880 --> 2:02:50.880]  both pay for the gasoline and the groceries and the rent and that kind of a
[2:02:50.880 --> 2:02:54.840]  squeezing in the middle class and you've got it up the building here of a
[2:02:54.840 --> 2:03:00.720]  perfect storm you've got already massive foreclosures going on across the
[2:03:00.720 --> 2:03:05.920]  country with home prices devaluing such that people are holding mortgages that
[2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:09.600]  are in excess of the value of the home they can't sell the home and get out
[2:03:09.600 --> 2:03:15.720]  from the mortgage this kind of a crisis is a meltdown and the solution as I
[2:03:15.720 --> 2:03:19.520]  wrote like rate USA the people are going to be presented is to say the only way
[2:03:19.520 --> 2:03:23.540]  we can solve these problems is to move into a regional economy the same way
[2:03:23.540 --> 2:03:27.200]  Europe did we have to have a North American Union and that's right a new
[2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:31.760]  currency the Amaro and Robert pastor the dean of all this as you've written in
[2:03:31.760 --> 2:03:35.440]  the book and as I covered an endgame they admit they're gonna create an
[2:03:35.440 --> 2:03:39.520]  economic crisis and then offer the solution of the North American Union
[2:03:39.520 --> 2:03:43.960]  well Robert pastor wrote that with you know the next 9-11 maybe what it would
[2:03:43.960 --> 2:03:49.400]  be needed to further the the agenda to integrate North America and I called
[2:03:49.400 --> 2:03:52.640]  him up and interviewed him about that because he made the comment in a
[2:03:52.640 --> 2:03:56.920]  Spanish language publication that I guess he thought no one would read and
[2:03:56.920 --> 2:04:01.080]  he said yeah he did make the comment now he was saying he didn't want a 9-11 to
[2:04:01.080 --> 2:04:05.160]  cause it but even to make the comment even that he's suggesting that he's
[2:04:05.160 --> 2:04:09.920]  thinking that the next 9-11 type crisis could push North American integration
[2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:15.000]  suggest that he's got in his mind the idea that we're going to utilize these
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:21.440]  crises economic or political or terrorism to further a global agenda and
[2:04:21.440 --> 2:04:26.040]  we have the neocons writing news articles about it we have tapes of
[2:04:26.040 --> 2:04:30.560]  Rumsfeld talking about how a new 9-11 is needed I mean doc it gets pretty
[2:04:30.560 --> 2:04:34.760]  obvious doesn't it well and I think the the main thing I'm concerned about right
[2:04:34.760 --> 2:04:38.520]  now is around I think that's the next crisis on the horizon stay there we're
[2:04:38.520 --> 2:04:42.320]  gonna talk to rusty Steve Randy and Tyler that's it for calls straight ahead

[2:11:45.480 --> 2:11:48.640]  Bilderberg group list along with Fed Chairman Bernanke videotape from going
[2:11:48.640 --> 2:11:52.080]  in and out and in Bilderberg 2008 along with Ben Bernanke the Federal Reserve
[2:11:52.080 --> 2:11:55.640]  Chairman Henry Paulson the US Treasury Secretary John Claude Trish yet the
[2:11:55.640 --> 2:11:58.720]  president of the European Central Bank Robert Zollick the president of the
[2:11:58.720 --> 2:12:02.200]  World Bank and other high-profile bankers does that answer your question yes
[2:12:02.200 --> 2:12:06.920]  and the article in world net daily that wrote about pastor was on December 15th
[2:12:06.920 --> 2:12:13.080]  2006 and it was entitled North American Union leader says Berger just crisis
[2:12:13.080 --> 2:12:19.440]  away okay December December 15th 2006 very good search by name course the
[2:12:19.440 --> 2:12:24.520]  North American Union leader says Berger just crisis away published on world net
[2:12:24.520 --> 2:12:29.040]  daily great okay and then the last one is Alex you had mentioned that there was
[2:12:29.040 --> 2:12:34.600]  a press a White House press release a little over a year ago that said that
[2:12:34.600 --> 2:12:39.120]  the US was backing who in Iraq yeah I would say it was about nine months ago
[2:12:39.120 --> 2:12:43.840]  it was in mid 2007 and the White House announced that it was supporting quote
[2:12:43.840 --> 2:12:48.840]  Mujahideen forces three different groups we know they're supporting for actually
[2:12:48.840 --> 2:12:53.040]  it's been all over the news I don't have it go to White House dot gov and also
[2:12:53.040 --> 2:12:56.200]  New Yorker magazine reported on it I mean it's basically like talking about the
[2:12:56.200 --> 2:12:59.280]  sun coming up in the morning this is known by anyone who's looked at hundreds
[2:12:59.280 --> 2:13:03.400]  of articles I mean if you heard about Iran suing the US for staging terror
[2:13:03.400 --> 2:13:07.320]  attacks inside Iran and then top generals going on Fox admitting it and saying how
[2:13:07.320 --> 2:13:12.280]  great it is yeah also while we've been talking since I've been on the program
[2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:16.280]  the stock market has gone negative it was about 80 points up this morning and I
[2:13:16.280 --> 2:13:20.640]  think it'll end negative today it went down 400 points yesterday yes and it's
[2:13:20.640 --> 2:13:25.920]  headed negative again today also the international energy agency just
[2:13:25.920 --> 2:13:32.640]  released this afternoon a report that said that worldwide oil demand was at a
[2:13:32.640 --> 2:13:40.600]  five-year low it's a six-year low and it's gonna fall further that's right
[2:13:40.600 --> 2:13:44.840]  people are cutting back on use because it's so expensive sky rocks at the
[2:13:44.840 --> 2:13:48.760]  opposite of the blind man expecting that world oil demand is gonna grow just
[2:13:48.760 --> 2:13:55.680]  0.9% or 800,000 barrels a day this year where their original growth
[2:13:55.680 --> 2:14:00.400]  estimate was for point two point one eight million barrels a day of growth
[2:14:00.400 --> 2:14:04.800]  that's a dramatic revision so they're saying that world oil demand is at its
[2:14:04.800 --> 2:14:10.200]  lowest point six years which means that you know this price spike is more
[2:14:10.200 --> 2:14:15.920]  directly a result of the decline in the value of the US dollar speculation yes
[2:14:15.920 --> 2:14:19.920]  and the fear of being priced into the possibility of another war that's right
[2:14:19.920 --> 2:14:23.760]  there everybody is great with any assets is grabbing anything tangible and
[2:14:23.760 --> 2:14:27.720]  real this is global meltdown in the beginning stages do you agree doctor
[2:14:27.720 --> 2:14:30.280]  thank you Steve for the call do you agree doctor that we've only seen the
[2:14:30.280 --> 2:14:35.520]  beginning it's just the beginning I mean the we've seen the implosion of the
[2:14:35.520 --> 2:14:40.680]  bubble you know the bubbles burst the mortgage markets imploded this crisis
[2:14:40.680 --> 2:14:45.780]  and and debt instruments has hit the US banking and that's a small bubble
[2:14:45.780 --> 2:14:50.960]  compared to the derivative 600 trivatives a drink of it is $600 trillion and one
[2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:54.400]  of the reasons I think get there is calling for this worldwide control
[2:14:54.400 --> 2:14:57.880]  I've also been following some controls being called for on the Bank of
[2:14:57.880 --> 2:15:02.080]  International settlement I think they're very concerned that these derivatives
[2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:06.760]  could implode the same way that the that the mortgage market let me let it stay
[2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:09.760]  doc let me just briefly explain what's happening in layman terms and have you
[2:15:09.760 --> 2:15:13.240]  comment that will take a call from Randy and Tyler and that's going to be it for
[2:15:13.240 --> 2:15:16.400]  calls for you I know you're very busy let me just break this down in layman
[2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:20.480]  terms okay you got the world central banks owned by less than 15 families
[2:15:20.480 --> 2:15:25.040]  mainly royalty the Rothschilds and Rockefell they're all private all private
[2:15:25.040 --> 2:15:31.880]  they already took over 1913 here 200 years ago in 1815 that for the Battle of
[2:15:31.880 --> 2:15:36.240]  Waterloo with the Rothschild scam in in London I'm already getting to detail the
[2:15:36.240 --> 2:15:40.800]  point is they control the banking they flooded the world with fiat numbers not
[2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:45.360]  even currency and and liquidity they then bought real assets infrastructure
[2:15:45.360 --> 2:15:49.920]  defense stocks energy stocks position themselves they bought real assets with
[2:15:49.920 --> 2:15:54.480]  fiat they then got us into debt to own us through fiat they are now artificially
[2:15:54.480 --> 2:15:58.440]  restricting the credit to the general public while giving themselves
[2:15:58.440 --> 2:16:03.320]  unlimited credit to buy up what they don't have that is left over and they
[2:16:03.320 --> 2:16:07.840]  are now purposely using these walls and and hundreds of trillions of dollars to
[2:16:07.840 --> 2:16:11.800]  forcibly buy up governments police military paying off the troops with
[2:16:11.800 --> 2:16:15.920]  hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash a piece to be part of merc armies this
[2:16:15.920 --> 2:16:21.520]  is a total complete economic military attack on free humanity dr. Corsi
[2:16:21.520 --> 2:16:26.280]  yeah well and when you're seeing right now the concern by the central bankers
[2:16:26.280 --> 2:16:30.560]  that the crisis is going to be used to increase more globalism I think the
[2:16:30.560 --> 2:16:34.960]  whole thing looks manufactured I mean right now you the world demand is not
[2:16:34.960 --> 2:16:39.640]  justifying the price increases in oil it's just not there and the price
[2:16:39.640 --> 2:16:45.680]  increases have further slowed world oil demand but this is not a normal
[2:16:45.680 --> 2:16:51.160]  price reflecting supply restrictions yeah they own the money machines they
[2:16:51.160 --> 2:16:54.740]  bought the world up with it and they took over the police because if we
[2:16:54.740 --> 2:16:58.320]  struggle becoming slaves they're gonna put us in camps and admit they've built
[2:16:58.320 --> 2:17:01.680]  them we're going into hell and the middle class is going to be against
[2:17:01.680 --> 2:17:05.840]  suffering middle class is going to be struggling to make ends meet with oil
[2:17:05.840 --> 2:17:09.800]  continuing to increase in price gasoline I think it's going to go up through the
[2:17:09.800 --> 2:17:13.960]  summer and I foresee despite the world demand lowering I think we're going to
[2:17:13.960 --> 2:17:21.000]  see 145 $250 a barrel and oil before it eases and it's going to be close to
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:26.520]  $5 a gallon within the within the next three to four months all right let's
[2:17:26.520 --> 2:17:30.240]  get while government spending explodes out of control and more and more cops
[2:17:30.240 --> 2:17:33.880]  riding tickets more and more bureaucrats just hell on earth people losing their
[2:17:33.880 --> 2:17:37.000]  jobs being fed on by predatory government absolutely criminal running
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:41.080]  wild landing in Michigan you're on the air worldwide yes Alex this is great that
[2:17:41.080 --> 2:17:44.000]  actually made it through the line finally to talk to my hero and I have a
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:47.600]  question for the doctor as well as statement for you confirmation rather
[2:17:47.600 --> 2:17:51.800]  my my eyes were open initially with you know with your terror storm DVD I got
[2:17:51.800 --> 2:17:57.360]  horrible history lesson but it's all true I just wonder it like I'm like I've
[2:17:57.360 --> 2:18:00.840]  seen your YouTube video with the massive pulling over I think you're in Texas and
[2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:05.440]  you videotaped it with the cops in the speed trap zone and it freaked me out and
[2:18:05.440 --> 2:18:08.360]  of course I'm in southeast Michigan that was a giant checkpoint they shut
[2:18:08.360 --> 2:18:11.480]  the interstate I 35 down yeah and they did something like that here on
[2:18:11.480 --> 2:18:15.400]  Grossbeck highway right down in Clinton Township Michigan they did it and they
[2:18:15.400 --> 2:18:18.520]  pulled over my my girlfriend and I was on the show earlier talking about it a
[2:18:18.520 --> 2:18:23.600]  month ago but anyways I got a question also about yeah the Iran thing for the
[2:18:23.600 --> 2:18:27.740]  doctor what's gonna happen if we attack a nation that's you know three times the
[2:18:27.740 --> 2:18:31.400]  size landmass of France I mean are they gonna annihilate us because look at
[2:18:31.400 --> 2:18:35.360]  Iraq's doing and like Alex said earlier you got how many million as opposed to
[2:18:35.360 --> 2:18:40.480]  65 million in Iran well we'll mobilize the Iranians against us when right now
[2:18:40.480 --> 2:18:44.040]  the Iranian people are very positive towards the United it will strengthen
[2:18:44.040 --> 2:18:47.520]  the hardliners it'll strengthen the hardliners and it's not clear that we
[2:18:47.520 --> 2:18:51.840]  would throw out the regime we might actually get the regime support by
[2:18:51.840 --> 2:18:55.840]  attacking oh it will entrench him permanently and you know the regime if
[2:18:55.840 --> 2:19:00.080]  even if we destroyed a good deal of the nuclear apparatus and attack it's not
[2:19:00.080 --> 2:19:03.960]  clear it would be successful because the Russians have sold the Manta you know
[2:19:03.960 --> 2:19:08.640]  serviced air missile defense systems to pay which will even hit now cruise
[2:19:08.640 --> 2:19:14.080]  missiles 11,000 of the of the missile units and so you know if this the
[2:19:14.080 --> 2:19:18.960]  nuclear establishment of Iran could be built back very quickly especially with
[2:19:18.960 --> 2:19:23.520]  the justification look we were we did get attacked without built get all the
[2:19:23.520 --> 2:19:26.280]  international doc let me twist your arm I know you got another interview coming

[2:20:45.600 --> 2:20:50.840]  669 8725 hello Ted Anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the
[2:20:50.840 --> 2:20:54.840]  Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with
[2:20:54.840 --> 2:20:58.520]  catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[2:20:58.520 --> 2:21:01.480]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their
[2:21:01.480 --> 2:21:05.240]  accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your
[2:21:05.240 --> 2:21:08.640]  deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will
[2:21:08.640 --> 2:21:12.160]  skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits
[2:21:12.160 --> 2:21:15.880]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is
[2:21:15.880 --> 2:21:19.800]  underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for
[2:21:19.800 --> 2:21:23.600]  depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and
[2:21:23.600 --> 2:21:27.800]  productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability I
[2:21:27.800 --> 2:21:32.240]  recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned
[2:21:32.240 --> 2:21:35.880]  into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been driven
[2:21:35.880 --> 2:21:40.520]  by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years for more

[2:25:12.200 --> 2:25:16.280]  which I think should get a very wide and big distribution for it
[2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:19.960]  Obama's got a cult of personality and I think this called a personality
[2:25:19.960 --> 2:25:25.120]  whenever it occurs in politics is very frightening history does not look well
[2:25:25.120 --> 2:25:29.400]  upon leaders who ride the cult personality tends to produce dictators
[2:25:29.400 --> 2:25:34.400]  and it tends to produce very disastrous endings I can say that much about it
[2:25:34.400 --> 2:25:39.680]  the rest is under embargo it's up on it's up already on on Amazon.com you
[2:25:39.680 --> 2:25:44.000]  can see the book but there's no cover on it yet you know I'll be carrying it yet
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:48.800]  but here's the deal he's got it for you I'll say this and I've analyzed it and
[2:25:48.800 --> 2:25:51.840]  I don't I'm not gonna vote for McCain or him I'm not picking candidates I could
[2:25:51.840 --> 2:25:55.200]  care less these black he could be green and I'd vote for him if he was a
[2:25:55.200 --> 2:26:00.440]  constitutionalist but I'll but bottom lot or bright glowing albino white like
[2:26:00.440 --> 2:26:05.600]  the albino vampire McCain I could care less about their skin pigment the
[2:26:05.600 --> 2:26:09.960]  problem is I see him getting bigger globalist support I see the establishment
[2:26:09.960 --> 2:26:14.840]  flipping sides over to him even over the wicked witcher the West Hillary I've
[2:26:14.840 --> 2:26:19.860]  never seen such a leech support and what we see with Barack Obama and you
[2:26:19.860 --> 2:26:23.680]  talked about him in the break being a Bilderberg presidential candidate I mean
[2:26:23.680 --> 2:26:27.400]  talk about something separate from the book is your take on Obama well you know
[2:26:27.400 --> 2:26:31.600]  again let's go on to I think there's gonna be plenty in the book on Obama
[2:26:31.600 --> 2:26:38.260]  and I just see that McCain here is a guy who you know I've I've fought McCain
[2:26:38.260 --> 2:26:42.200]  for eight years on on a variety of issues including securing the borders
[2:26:42.200 --> 2:26:46.480]  but McCain does not have a cult of personality in fact McCain actually has
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:50.480]  a personality that's one of his problems he's older he's not going to be as
[2:26:50.480 --> 2:26:55.880]  powerful he's um you know be more easily influenced more easily willing to listen
[2:26:55.880 --> 2:27:00.480]  to the people so I think you've got more opportunity to have a president of
[2:27:00.480 --> 2:27:04.360]  McCain who would be swayed but I certainly did not write this book to
[2:27:04.360 --> 2:27:09.000]  promote McCain I can't bring myself to promote McCain I think you know I don't
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:12.200]  I've been fighting McCain if he's president I expect to continue fighting
[2:27:12.200 --> 2:27:18.160]  him but bottom line we want a weak president like the founders said we
[2:27:18.160 --> 2:27:23.200]  don't want a strong I agree I mean the whole system of the government that the
[2:27:23.200 --> 2:27:28.360]  counter balances between the executive legislative of the judicial is meant to
[2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:33.440]  have weak branches the government that have to get the others to cooperate to
[2:27:33.440 --> 2:27:37.240]  get anything accomplished it was meant to make it hard for the government to
[2:27:37.240 --> 2:27:42.160]  accomplish anything the Imperial presidency which traces back probably
[2:27:42.160 --> 2:27:47.400]  to Abraham Lincoln is has been a disaster for America there's an example
[2:27:47.400 --> 2:27:51.000]  founders intended here's an example if Bush had the charisma and I personally
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:55.880]  you know look at Obama he's very charismatic I don't dislike him he
[2:27:55.880 --> 2:27:59.200]  doesn't have all the baggage of a Hillary or somebody so I tend to at a gut
[2:27:59.200 --> 2:28:03.760]  level you know not hate him as much but exactly that's a great danger imagine
[2:28:03.760 --> 2:28:07.760]  it Bush would have had the charisma of Obama I mean the establishments behind
[2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:15.320]  him for a reason well that's right and see the president who has less charisma
[2:28:15.320 --> 2:28:19.720]  who has a more difficult time getting his policies implemented more difficult
[2:28:19.720 --> 2:28:25.160]  time with Congress I think the American people may give Congress continued
[2:28:25.160 --> 2:28:28.560]  control to the Democrats but I don't think the American people are going to
[2:28:28.560 --> 2:28:33.080]  give the presidency also to the Democrats American people like to divide power
[2:28:33.080 --> 2:28:36.960]  between the parties I think Obama is going to have a very hard time in the
[2:28:36.960 --> 2:28:40.640]  general election and I've written this book to bring out a lot of things I'm
[2:28:40.640 --> 2:28:44.800]  looking forward to its publication the embargo will be over on August 12th and

[2:34:07.600 --> 2:34:11.040]  152 year old building could have been started under the watch for live
[2:34:11.040 --> 2:34:15.120]  surveillance cameras and DPS troopers who were garrisoned right there in another
[2:34:15.120 --> 2:34:19.120]  building 50 yards from where the fire started then a couple hundred yards
[2:34:19.120 --> 2:34:25.160]  across the street you have more than 25 DPS officers a state police special unit
[2:34:25.160 --> 2:34:30.440]  capital police is their state police designation and then they lied and said
[2:34:30.440 --> 2:34:35.680]  they called 911 immediately but the eyewitness said no one was there he got
[2:34:35.680 --> 2:34:40.240]  there saw the fire called 911 took him about 15 minutes to arrive the fire
[2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:45.720]  department then the state police showed up right after them coming out of the
[2:34:45.720 --> 2:34:56.240]  Capitol he saw no one coming out of the side house there and I know the
[2:34:56.240 --> 2:35:00.200]  governor's mansion I've been in a couple film events there years ago and I got
[2:35:00.200 --> 2:35:07.640]  invited to the Texas Film Association Film Society kind of forget first lady
[2:35:07.640 --> 2:35:11.720]  now Bush Laura Bush seeing me and running over and asking why I was there
[2:35:11.720 --> 2:35:20.000]  that was like a 1997 there are four cameras in one tree that I've seen there
[2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:23.640]  are cameras on every corner of the building itself and on the fence there
[2:35:23.640 --> 2:35:27.680]  is a eight-foot rod iron fence with spikes on the top they had another
[2:35:27.680 --> 2:35:31.760]  construction fence that was 10 feet tall to 8 feet tall depending on which
[2:35:31.760 --> 2:35:35.960]  section around that were to believe someone scaled it went in and set fire
[2:35:35.960 --> 2:35:41.360]  to the building there are motion sensors all over it that is admitted let me
[2:35:41.360 --> 2:35:44.880]  read to you the email we got and we've vetted and done some checking confirm
[2:35:44.880 --> 2:35:49.280]  this is an accurate individual we're going to use a fake name for him we're
[2:35:49.280 --> 2:35:53.600]  going to call him David this is his email to us this morning hi fellas this is
[2:35:53.600 --> 2:35:57.840]  info wars.com I currently work for the TFC the agency that manages the building
[2:35:57.840 --> 2:36:01.360]  maintenance and I work on security in the complex I think there could be a
[2:36:01.360 --> 2:36:05.200]  cover-up there the mansion is a very large security system with infrared
[2:36:05.200 --> 2:36:07.840]  motion detectors see we already knew all this but here he is confirming it
[2:36:07.840 --> 2:36:12.160]  around the entire yard perimeter if anyone jumps the fence a flat screen
[2:36:12.160 --> 2:36:16.280]  monitor alerts an audible and visible alarm in the carriage house not to
[2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:19.560]  mention the large fire alarm system which is monitored at three separate
[2:36:19.560 --> 2:36:24.920]  locations by live officers there are at least 32 cameras there alone most of
[2:36:24.920 --> 2:36:29.280]  them are pan-tilt zoom the guards there were probably busy watching Fox News or
[2:36:29.280 --> 2:36:32.880]  their TV up there there's a few guards up there the older ones who are pretty
[2:36:32.880 --> 2:36:39.720]  smart the younger ones ain't too bright 32 cams of 246 flat screen monitors and
[2:36:39.720 --> 2:36:44.800]  nobody saw anything or monitoring from the little house that is there it's
[2:36:44.800 --> 2:36:51.720]  actually pretty good size and from the governor's mansion just unbelievable and
[2:36:51.720 --> 2:36:58.240]  we now go to David who helped work on the security there great rest to himself
[2:36:58.240 --> 2:37:00.440]  coming public now David thanks for coming on
[2:37:00.440 --> 2:37:05.240]  how's it going Alex tell us tell us as much as you can why you think this is
[2:37:05.240 --> 2:37:13.360]  very suspicious and there could be a cover-up well basically if you drive you
[2:37:13.360 --> 2:37:19.480]  know anybody can drive around right now and and look at the gate that's around
[2:37:19.480 --> 2:37:26.160]  the mansion first of all they put up one of those large green construction gates
[2:37:26.160 --> 2:37:34.000]  you know first of all you'd have to scale that as you had said and I just find
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:38.440]  it hard to believe that you know when I first heard about this first thing that
[2:37:38.440 --> 2:37:42.920]  came to my mind was maybe something you know a fire maybe dealing with the all
[2:37:42.920 --> 2:37:50.600]  the construction going on over there but you know hearing them ruling it you know
[2:37:50.600 --> 2:37:55.040]  an arson and they don't have a suspect I just find that hard to believe they're
[2:37:55.040 --> 2:37:58.720]  claiming they've got some video somebody walking around it's it's probably the guy
[2:37:58.720 --> 2:38:03.400]  that called it in with his wife that they're now you know claiming they saw
[2:38:03.400 --> 2:38:07.240]  on security walking around outside there's people everywhere walking around
[2:38:07.240 --> 2:38:10.840]  let's break down the security system you've worked on what is actually in
[2:38:10.840 --> 2:38:14.680]  there these motion detectors these infrared trip systems these audible
[2:38:14.680 --> 2:38:20.920]  audio and visual alarms yeah well basically I've done contract work over
[2:38:20.920 --> 2:38:25.840]  there in the past I mean it's been a while since I have worked on any equipment
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:31.440]  over there I do know that they were revamping all the security equipment
[2:38:31.440 --> 2:38:35.640]  over there putting all the latest hot you know more high-tech equipment in there
[2:38:35.640 --> 2:38:42.800]  let me just add I know it's up I walked up to cameras and I watch them turn in
[2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:47.880]  their black domes and aim at me yeah on every basically on every angle that
[2:38:47.880 --> 2:38:54.440]  property there's CCTV camera and then there's also you can look around just
[2:38:54.440 --> 2:38:58.160]  look at you know down the street on there's like a hotel building or
[2:38:58.160 --> 2:39:01.840]  something right across the street and there's cameras on that building Sheriff's
[2:39:01.840 --> 2:39:06.960]  Department is that what it is Sheriff's Department and then we know if Larry
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:12.040]  Silverstein is involved in this one well yeah the Sheriff's Department is
[2:39:12.040 --> 2:39:18.640]  approximately 16 yards we pasted off from the governor's mansion on the west
[2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:24.520]  side yeah I mean back when I had put in you know worked on security equipment
[2:39:24.520 --> 2:39:29.040]  over there there was the cameras back then were even you know they were
[2:39:29.040 --> 2:39:33.200]  expensive high-tech cameras I mean I find it very hard to believe that
[2:39:33.200 --> 2:39:38.400]  somebody could have scaled the wall and live fire you know however they're
[2:39:38.400 --> 2:39:42.760]  claiming it happened well here's an example here's an example I have walked
[2:39:42.760 --> 2:39:46.160]  up to videotape at night wanting shots of it for in-game that people see in the
[2:39:46.160 --> 2:39:50.520]  film and they come over and ask what I'm doing that that another evening I
[2:39:50.520 --> 2:39:54.600]  decided I need another moving shot of it so we got in them in the back of Aaron's
[2:39:54.600 --> 2:39:59.020]  got a Mustang was a convertible I got in it we drove by with a video camera came
[2:39:59.020 --> 2:40:02.520]  back around and they ran out in the street state police dangerous to
[2:40:02.520 --> 2:40:06.360]  themselves jumping out in front of us we almost ran over the guy we were on
[2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:09.520]  about 20 miles an hour and he literally just jumps out 20 feet in front of the
[2:40:09.520 --> 2:40:13.080]  car we slam on the brakes Austin cops pull up behind us they start laughing
[2:40:13.080 --> 2:40:16.040]  when they see it's me and drive off because the guy was asking us we were
[2:40:16.040 --> 2:40:19.600]  terrorists and then literally the Austin cops I know one of the old guys
[2:40:19.600 --> 2:40:22.660]  who are laughing and since you later Alex and then the state police looked
[2:40:22.660 --> 2:40:25.680]  stupid and walked off they wanted to see what was on our cameras till the Austin
[2:40:25.680 --> 2:40:30.280]  cops waved at us and laugh because they know me so well so that was going on I
[2:40:30.280 --> 2:40:33.960]  bullhorned him many times had him come up to me I've had him I mean this is over
[2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:37.920]  and over again they come up to you and then suddenly on this night there's
[2:40:37.920 --> 2:40:42.320]  nobody there how many officers the state police capital police are usually in the
[2:40:42.320 --> 2:40:48.240]  wheelhouse oh gosh I don't know I mean every time I've been over there there's
[2:40:48.240 --> 2:40:53.520]  been at least you know four or five officers there any given time you know
[2:40:53.520 --> 2:41:02.600]  ready so he's pretty odd to me well what about now we learned that the Austin
[2:41:02.600 --> 2:41:09.920]  police department and fire department say that Alfonso Perez did call them and
[2:41:09.920 --> 2:41:13.920]  was the first to call the state police didn't call them until at least 15
[2:41:13.920 --> 2:41:19.800]  minutes after and the state police lied and said that said that they did call
[2:41:19.800 --> 2:41:22.880]  911 when there's no record of it that's the Austin American statesman and news
[2:41:22.880 --> 2:41:27.200]  aid today and I want your take on that and they will not say how many officers
[2:41:27.200 --> 2:41:33.480]  were on duty yeah I read that in the Associated Press actually I thought that
[2:41:33.480 --> 2:41:39.000]  was that was kind of hot I mean why disclose information from the public and
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:47.760]  the media you know I mean that's I don't know why they're just you know
[2:41:47.760 --> 2:41:51.400]  disclosed the information if you don't have anything to hide I mean that's what
[2:41:51.400 --> 2:41:58.240]  they tell us right well I was worried about it has gold painted spikes it
[2:41:58.240 --> 2:42:04.280]  appointed on an eight foot higher in some areas right iron gate and fence but
[2:42:04.280 --> 2:42:07.800]  outside that was another eight to ten foot depending on which section we
[2:42:07.800 --> 2:42:14.920]  measured it yesterday two fences I get a garrison house of state police who were
[2:42:14.920 --> 2:42:18.720]  there 24 hours a day across the streets the Capitol got the sheriff's
[2:42:18.720 --> 2:42:22.080]  department across the street there's always cop cars parked down there at
[2:42:22.080 --> 2:42:27.520]  night what on earth is going on here I know who's gonna benefit I guess we'll
[2:42:27.520 --> 2:42:31.560]  find out who benefits from the whole deal and that'll give us a little more
[2:42:31.560 --> 2:42:38.640]  insight on it now tell us about the security system itself I mean basically
[2:42:38.640 --> 2:42:47.040]  you have outside cameras that are you know high-tech cameras and you can zoom
[2:42:47.040 --> 2:42:52.920]  in pretty pretty pretty far out with them and I worked on the motion
[2:42:52.920 --> 2:42:58.080]  detection system out there you know and some of that equipment was up near the
[2:42:58.080 --> 2:43:02.240]  camera you know where all the camera equipment is I want to divulge any of
[2:43:02.240 --> 2:43:05.280]  that information but well you can't miss it every tree out there's got
[2:43:05.280 --> 2:43:10.440]  cameras hanging off of it yeah I mean it's very obvious if anybody was to
[2:43:10.440 --> 2:43:13.680]  walk around there you can clearly see the cameras well well if they're looking
[2:43:13.680 --> 2:43:18.960]  for a suspect this is what's most suspicious there are two trees of one
[2:43:18.960 --> 2:43:22.920]  about 20 yards one about 15 yards we videotaped them yesterday me to put
[2:43:22.920 --> 2:43:27.920]  more of this on the web and one tree has four cameras and what look like boxes
[2:43:27.920 --> 2:43:31.520]  that that are motion detectors and infrared correct me if I'm wrong they're
[2:43:31.520 --> 2:43:35.160]  both aimed at the front door then there's other trees with cameras and
[2:43:35.160 --> 2:43:38.720]  there's the big cameras on every corner there's cameras on the building why
[2:43:38.720 --> 2:43:42.680]  wouldn't they release the footage and say find this person or I mean again
[2:43:42.680 --> 2:43:47.080]  that they're acting very suspicious I don't know we've we've seen the same
[2:43:47.080 --> 2:43:54.080]  thing with you know in the past with the Pentagon footage for instance you know
[2:43:54.080 --> 2:44:01.080]  I mean why won't they show us the tape from the hotel or the gas station you
[2:44:01.080 --> 2:44:09.040]  know all the Pentagon cameras instead of a snapshot camera yeah three frames
[2:44:09.040 --> 2:44:13.840]  now now tell me about this motion detector now imagine let's say you know
[2:44:13.840 --> 2:44:18.240]  the average person like me wanted to try to scale the wall and let's say you
[2:44:18.240 --> 2:44:24.440]  know put a bag of cookies on the front porch you may you may get about five
[2:44:24.440 --> 2:44:30.360]  feet and then you'd have you'd have some people running towards you let's do it
[2:44:30.360 --> 2:44:37.120]  that way yeah so let's say I climbed the 10 foot security fence I climbed the
[2:44:37.120 --> 2:44:42.760]  eight foot spiked fence without cutting into myself I and then I get past all
[2:44:42.760 --> 2:44:47.640]  the motion detectors I put the bag of cookies whoever this was mall off
[2:44:47.640 --> 2:44:51.240]  cocktail or whatever it was set it on fire or in my case leave the bag of
[2:44:51.240 --> 2:44:55.160]  cookies this is hypothetical don't edit together please I run back climb back
[2:44:55.160 --> 2:45:00.040]  over the rod-iron spike fence climb back over the security fence that has vinyl
[2:45:00.040 --> 2:45:03.480]  on it so you can't stick your feet in the fence I climb over that and I get
[2:45:03.480 --> 2:45:08.600]  away but but but here's the coup de grace people could say well maybe the
[2:45:08.600 --> 2:45:11.520]  cameras are off or maybe something was happening with them how would whoever
[2:45:11.520 --> 2:45:16.480]  fire bombed this know to attack right when the security system wasn't on now
[2:45:16.480 --> 2:45:19.520]  they haven't said that yet they won't talk or acting very suspicious but but
[2:45:19.520 --> 2:45:24.040]  but let's just say it was turned off how would the terrorist attack when it was
[2:45:24.040 --> 2:45:30.320]  off I find it you know why were all the art you know all the artifacts in the
[2:45:30.320 --> 2:45:36.640]  house and the furniture all of that was removed to all right to this event too
[2:45:36.640 --> 2:45:39.520]  wasn't and the media is lying and hyping and saying it was in there but
[2:45:39.520 --> 2:45:43.640]  later admitted know that almost all of it was out of the house so just like the
[2:45:43.640 --> 2:45:47.960]  wing and the Pentagon that got hit was 99% shut down and had just been rebuilt
[2:45:47.960 --> 2:45:52.760]  yeah that's no telling Alex I mean it's you know who we're dealing with these
[2:45:52.760 --> 2:45:56.280]  days well it's well known around Austin you say you've worked around the
[2:45:56.280 --> 2:45:59.720]  Capitol talking to state legislators and people in Austin and police that the
[2:45:59.720 --> 2:46:03.360]  fire in the 80s they couldn't get money they failed the legislature to get money
[2:46:03.360 --> 2:46:06.720]  to renovate the underground section of the Capitol it's huge and that they
[2:46:06.720 --> 2:46:12.200]  burned it there that was a fire they said have you ever heard that no I haven't
[2:46:12.200 --> 2:46:16.560]  heard that well it's well known for those inside politics that the government
[2:46:16.560 --> 2:46:20.920]  burned it down to renovate the whole Capitol and I hope they don't claim it's
[2:46:20.920 --> 2:46:24.520]  terrorist it you know because they're there yeah that's that's that's what I'm
[2:46:24.520 --> 2:46:29.000]  worried about I just hope they don't try to spin this off to some kind of you
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:35.440]  know domestic act of terrorism and you know let me ask you this how often
[2:46:35.440 --> 2:46:40.040]  police are now we go down low pack you know you're going five miles over the
[2:46:40.040 --> 2:46:46.760]  speed limit you're gonna get tagged well you notice they said of three weeks
[2:46:46.760 --> 2:46:50.320]  ago they were gonna convert the state police's main mission to quote fighting
[2:46:50.320 --> 2:46:54.120]  terror which is non-existent that is harassing the people intelligence
[2:46:54.120 --> 2:46:58.360]  units basically death squads and the state some of the state police higher
[2:46:58.360 --> 2:47:01.720]  up so they didn't want to do that it was stupid that's going to do their job
[2:47:01.720 --> 2:47:05.680]  public safety they've really changed the last few years being really nice
[2:47:05.680 --> 2:47:08.880]  professional they're really being a bunch of out of control people in my
[2:47:08.880 --> 2:47:12.880]  experience it's really changed where they act whether they behave even the
[2:47:12.880 --> 2:47:18.080]  Capitol police but a very interesting this happened now man I tell you and
[2:47:18.080 --> 2:47:20.880]  then I was talking to the state police and they were acting no I don't want to
[2:47:20.880 --> 2:47:24.200]  say guilty like they were involved you know the average grunts but they were
[2:47:24.200 --> 2:47:32.560]  they were they were acting very freaked out themselves well hopefully we'll get
[2:47:32.560 --> 2:47:38.880]  some more real information out of here pretty soon David anything else you want
[2:47:38.880 --> 2:47:43.840]  to add any other points you want to make I think that's about it I also want to
[2:47:43.840 --> 2:47:50.720]  kind of see if we could maybe make some noise for Ron Paul and Jesse Venture and
[2:47:50.720 --> 2:47:54.920]  08 I don't think that's gonna happen Ron Paul said he's only running as a
[2:47:54.920 --> 2:47:58.600]  Republican unfortunately and Ventura will announce in the next three weeks
[2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:02.280]  whether he's gonna run for Senate but I certainly agree with you have you talked
[2:48:02.280 --> 2:48:04.920]  to any of your other friends that have worked on that government building our
[2:48:04.920 --> 2:48:10.480]  art is anybody else you know smelling a big gigantic stinking rat oh yeah I have
[2:48:10.480 --> 2:48:15.400]  several buddies of mine that just you know everybody when I first heard the
[2:48:15.400 --> 2:48:20.440]  news that was their first you know just didn't seem right something didn't seem
[2:48:20.440 --> 2:48:27.080]  right with the whole being a coming out being a arson event I just seems kind of
[2:48:27.080 --> 2:48:31.080]  weird you put those motion detectors in the media is not talking about those
[2:48:31.080 --> 2:48:35.000]  they're doing everything they can to cover this up you say that within five
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:39.400]  feet of going over that fence anywhere in the perimeter or are there any dead
[2:48:39.400 --> 2:48:43.000]  spots that that I know there's motion on the front door you can see I'm aiming at
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:48.760]  it I mean and and you admit and they admit it it's an audible alarm and a
[2:48:48.760 --> 2:48:54.040]  visual one in multiple sir you said three three separate what in the capital in
[2:48:54.040 --> 2:48:58.600]  the wheelhouse and we're asked where else do garrison state police get an
[2:48:58.600 --> 2:49:08.200]  alarm that's the DPS I believe has just I mean that's DPS that works over there so
[2:49:08.200 --> 2:49:14.960]  I'm pretty sure that you know they have their systems in place well up on up on
[2:49:14.960 --> 2:49:18.680]  Lamar Bernard at their main headquarters we know at the wheelhouse on the
[2:49:18.680 --> 2:49:23.360]  governor's mansion 50 yards from the arson attack and then 200 yards away in
[2:49:23.360 --> 2:49:28.760]  the belly of the capital yep I've been down there too I've had him invite me
[2:49:28.760 --> 2:49:34.920]  down there 10 years ago six seven years ago and they were still friendly last
[2:49:34.920 --> 2:49:39.600]  time I was over there there was still pretty friendly and good people but I
[2:49:39.600 --> 2:49:42.400]  know though all the old guys are listeners they're huge fans they're all
[2:49:42.400 --> 2:49:45.600]  listening right now I know it's just I've said hi to the young ones and they
[2:49:45.600 --> 2:49:49.040]  said get away from me right now when the one you know we're having an event out

[3:09:54.240 --> 3:09:58.080]  buy our carbon credits from the private banks with local police enforcing
[3:09:58.080 --> 3:10:02.320]  environmental rules on taxes on our breathing as the new as the New York
[3:10:02.320 --> 3:10:06.280]  Times called it and everything we said they've done we will pay taxes on our
[3:10:06.280 --> 3:10:11.080]  breathing and our carbon use to the central banks and they will globally have
[3:10:11.080 --> 3:10:15.160]  a global government run by the private banks everything we said they do out of
[3:10:15.160 --> 3:10:19.440]  this crisis they created they're now doing Bob Chapman. Well that's correct
[3:10:19.440 --> 3:10:26.760]  and they are doing behind the scenes what they call harmonization and that
[3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:32.840]  is within industry and cross-border harmonization within industry with rules
[3:10:32.840 --> 3:10:38.520]  and things like that and the people don't know what they're doing and when
[3:10:38.520 --> 3:10:42.680]  they want to finally make a change like that's what they're doing with the
[3:10:42.680 --> 3:10:46.880]  North American Union all of a sudden all the groundwork's been laid nobody knew
[3:10:46.880 --> 3:10:50.960]  about it but they've been working on it because they get the time and money and
[3:10:50.960 --> 3:10:56.280]  staff to do so and that's a very important part of it the second thing is
[3:10:56.280 --> 3:11:03.280]  to bring Europe the United States and in Canada among the wealthiest nations in
[3:11:03.280 --> 3:11:09.960]  the world to be economically and the reason for that is to force them to
[3:11:09.960 --> 3:11:18.560]  accept world government and part of that is the first nationalization of banking
[3:11:18.560 --> 3:11:25.560]  the financial world in general insurance and they're in the process of doing that
[3:11:25.560 --> 3:11:31.440]  in the United States right now and the European Central Bank at least among
[3:11:31.440 --> 3:11:37.440]  those in the Eurozone is doing the same thing and if you notice they had the
[3:11:37.440 --> 3:11:42.520]  Lisbon agreement which everybody in Europe disagrees with for the most part
[3:11:42.520 --> 3:11:48.000]  on balance I should say and this lawsuits again but the against it but this
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:53.320]  shows you the extent that they will go to to get what they want what that
[3:11:53.320 --> 3:12:00.160]  Lisbon agreement was is to have a constitution and call it by another
[3:12:00.160 --> 3:12:06.480]  name that other name was agreement and the people in France and in Holland both
[3:12:06.480 --> 3:12:11.200]  had voted that agreement down so those are the kind of things that they're
[3:12:11.200 --> 3:12:17.200]  doing let me add your take on this down okay finish up go ahead sorry that's
[3:12:17.200 --> 3:12:24.800]  okay now you were finishing up I talked over you said to do what to these are
[3:12:24.800 --> 3:12:29.880]  the kinds of things that they're doing some of the things you see other things
[3:12:29.880 --> 3:12:36.560]  you don't see harmonization you don't see nationalization of the banks you do
[3:12:36.560 --> 3:12:40.640]  you don't realize what they're doing until it's been done now we had the
[3:12:40.640 --> 3:12:47.480]  internationalization of banks and what all is said and done down the line as
[3:12:47.480 --> 3:12:52.680]  Brzezinski says like 30 years from now because our program has been all messed
[3:12:52.680 --> 3:12:59.720]  up and that's how long it's going to take now what they'll have to do is
[3:12:59.720 --> 3:13:04.400]  internationalize these banks so that you've got a handful of banks to go to
[3:13:04.400 --> 3:13:11.200]  and if you are outspoken about what's going on they cancel your bank account
[3:13:11.200 --> 3:13:18.000]  and incidentally in England they're doing that with people now who work with
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:26.280]  Iranian based enterprises in the United Kingdom the Barclays is closing their
[3:13:26.280 --> 3:13:31.680]  bank accounts because they say that the people who work for these Iranian
[3:13:31.680 --> 3:13:37.920]  companies are assisting terrorism and that's a very dangerous trend I want to
[3:13:37.920 --> 3:13:41.120]  talk more about that we know bush on an executive order about eight months ago
[3:13:41.120 --> 3:13:46.800]  nine months ago saying that anybody even retroactively who is in business with
[3:13:46.800 --> 3:13:51.000]  any company or group retroactively that they claim ever dealt with any terrorist
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:55.520]  group they're going to seize all your assets so a great new Admiralty type
[3:13:55.520 --> 3:14:00.320]  letter of mark system coming in meanwhile Halliburton help give nuclear
[3:14:00.320 --> 3:14:05.360]  components admittedly BBC to Pakistan and Iran is their total sickening
[3:14:05.360 --> 3:14:10.240]  hypocrites but but I wanted to bring up what Dr. Jerome Corsi brought up in the
[3:14:10.240 --> 3:14:13.880]  last hour and that is that the Securities Exchange Commission and the
[3:14:13.880 --> 3:14:17.240]  Commerce Department have announced that for over a hundred years they have
[3:14:17.240 --> 3:14:21.880]  shown statistics on foreign company ownership and buyups and overseeing and
[3:14:21.880 --> 3:14:24.160]  the government would not allow a lot of that it was seen against our interest
[3:14:24.160 --> 3:14:28.960]  now they will no longer review any foreign buying or takeover and they will
[3:14:28.960 --> 3:14:33.680]  keep that secret from the public so here's all our info is citizens public
[3:14:33.680 --> 3:14:37.880]  but then foreign corporations coming in as the dollar plunges and buying
[3:14:37.880 --> 3:14:42.880]  everything up that's going to be secret yes and I I think it goes beyond that
[3:14:42.880 --> 3:14:49.000]  and incidentally Jerome Corsi is a wonderful researcher and he does a
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:56.240]  wonderful job and we carry his articles just like we carry yours and in a
[3:14:56.240 --> 3:15:01.360]  prominent place in our publication you know to link with to what other people
[3:15:01.360 --> 3:15:06.160]  are having to say so I don't have to write about it but anyway I think it goes
[3:15:06.160 --> 3:15:10.840]  further than that I think one of the reasons that the government has been
[3:15:10.840 --> 3:15:18.320]  taking over so much land and things like that collateral oh yeah federal
[3:15:18.320 --> 3:15:23.280]  federal land is I think they've got it up as collateral and I'm just guessing I
[3:15:23.280 --> 3:15:27.320]  think they've got it up as collateral actually in the IMF World Bank documents
[3:15:27.320 --> 3:15:35.760]  Bob what's that that's in the Joseph Sticklets leaked November 2000 IMF
[3:15:35.760 --> 3:15:40.160]  World Bank documents and I didn't I haven't seen that well your analysis is
[3:15:40.160 --> 3:15:45.640]  correct and you know it's just you know I try to think of what they're going to
[3:15:45.640 --> 3:15:50.160]  do before they do it or well they're doing it well obviously I'm eight years
[3:15:50.160 --> 3:15:56.960]  behind on this one but my insight I guess was there six it was 2002 well
[3:15:56.960 --> 3:15:59.200]  no I mean who can know everything you know more than I do about economics
[3:15:59.200 --> 3:16:03.280]  we're all scanning and I interviewed all the experts Bob in the four minutes
[3:16:03.280 --> 3:16:05.520]  we've got left you'll be with us a full hour in the second hour tomorrow
[3:16:05.520 --> 3:16:08.280]  everybody should tune in for that whereas we give a whole overview and how to
[3:16:08.280 --> 3:16:12.400]  protect yourselves and more right now oil exploding they're trying to suppress
[3:16:12.400 --> 3:16:16.600]  gold it was up to 900 something last week down this week what do you see
[3:16:16.600 --> 3:16:22.120]  happening well they will continue to try to take gold down but it'll keep right
[3:16:22.120 --> 3:16:28.240]  on coming back along with silver and as far as oil is concerned it's a hard
[3:16:28.240 --> 3:16:34.040]  call because it's pretty expensive at this point I think a fair price for oil
[3:16:34.040 --> 3:16:39.400]  right now is probably around $80 a barrel and it could you know when time
[3:16:39.400 --> 3:16:45.880]  go back to 50 but not around now and I think perhaps we might trade here
[3:16:45.880 --> 3:16:50.840]  somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty dollars a barrel you
[3:16:50.840 --> 3:16:55.840]  know one of the the main problem with with all of the commodities or
[3:16:55.840 --> 3:17:00.920]  anything that trades in dollars is a depreciating dollar and of course they
[3:17:00.920 --> 3:17:07.000]  come out and jawbone a pulse and then Bernanke yesterday and today again about
[3:17:07.000 --> 3:17:11.880]  the dollars of the dollar rallies but it can't it can't hold a rally it isn't
[3:17:11.880 --> 3:17:17.520]  going anywhere to the upside and so you're going to have continued pressure
[3:17:17.520 --> 3:17:23.880]  on everything that is dollar related and oil is one of those things except for
[3:17:23.880 --> 3:17:30.280]  Iran selling oil everybody else sells it's in dollars and and then you've
[3:17:30.280 --> 3:17:35.760]  got people in Israel and people in Washington particularly our president
[3:17:35.760 --> 3:17:40.960]  telling everybody almost every day that they're going to invade next week or the
[3:17:40.960 --> 3:17:46.880]  week after the week after that now people don't know what's going to happen
[3:17:46.880 --> 3:17:52.320]  the wall will he will the purge and go will the streets be shut down and so
[3:17:52.320 --> 3:17:56.320]  yeah they're clearly doing things to the stable let me just so you're saying
[3:17:56.320 --> 3:18:01.480]  they're clearly trying to destabilize at a bare minimum to create instability in
[3:18:01.480 --> 3:18:07.960]  the dollar and make people speculate and drive up all of the raw materials the
[3:18:07.960 --> 3:18:12.680]  commodities that are out there so there they're by design destabilizing well you
[3:18:12.680 --> 3:18:17.800]  know you gotta think of it this way why would Israel and our administration
[3:18:17.800 --> 3:18:24.640]  run around so frequently telling people that they're gonna bomb Iran I mean it's
[3:18:24.640 --> 3:18:29.640]  just over and over and over again and all that does is make the price of oil
[3:18:29.640 --> 3:18:35.840]  and other things go up in addition to the inflation that's being caused by a
[3:18:35.840 --> 3:18:43.640]  dollar which is well not what the paper it's written on essentially and and so
[3:18:43.640 --> 3:18:49.040]  that they're exacerbating the problem is what they're doing do you still you're
[3:18:49.040 --> 3:18:52.600]  right in you you say why would they do that well maybe they want to higher
[3:18:52.600 --> 3:18:57.920]  prices why because it puts people in a position where they'll have to take
[3:18:57.920 --> 3:19:03.640]  what's given to them in other words governmental control comes from the
[3:19:03.640 --> 3:19:12.560]  inability to be able to buy food and energy at reasonable prices Bob Chapman

[3:26:23.360 --> 3:26:39.560]  welcome I have two articles I've written which I think about really well and I'm
[3:26:39.560 --> 3:26:43.880]  just curious if you could publish them on your website yeah send them by to us
[3:26:43.880 --> 3:26:47.200]  Aaron was ever like four in the morning so he's not in right now but send them to
[3:26:47.200 --> 3:26:52.320]  Aaron info wars.com send them to Kurt what's Kurt's web address always got his
[3:26:52.320 --> 3:26:56.680]  own we need to get him an info wars address and give that out but okay well
[3:26:56.680 --> 3:27:01.360]  before out the corner can you tell me the email addresses and the reason I
[3:27:01.360 --> 3:27:06.160]  wanted to have them on your website is because their two major stories one is
[3:27:06.160 --> 3:27:11.720]  about um fluoride and the other one is about the dropout rate which um and how
[3:27:11.720 --> 3:27:15.120]  basically no child left behind is actually hurting the country was designed
[3:27:15.120 --> 3:27:19.080]  to do that yeah exactly that's basically what it was about and it was like really
[3:27:19.080 --> 3:27:22.680]  good especially important to be written by so on my age and it was supposed to
[3:27:22.680 --> 3:27:27.360]  actually be the cover of um the school newspaper and my school's like really

[3:35:36.600 --> 3:35:39.520]  most influential people in the world are believed to gather the Westfields
[3:35:39.520 --> 3:35:43.120]  Marriott hotel in Shantilly Virginia for several days all the major media except
[3:35:43.120 --> 3:35:46.320]  for the epoch times are apparently silent about it this event is an annual
[3:35:46.320 --> 3:35:50.040]  gathering of the Bilderberg group let's punch that up on screen former
[3:35:50.040 --> 3:35:53.480]  secretary of state Malin Albright chairman of the Federal Reserve in
[3:35:53.480 --> 3:35:57.000]  Bernanke Henry Kessinger Vernon Jordan others were seen by witnesses and
[3:35:57.000 --> 3:36:00.840]  some of them were confirmed by others just outside the hotel photos and
[3:36:00.840 --> 3:36:04.920]  videotapes were taken of them seen websites I see the websites operated by
[3:36:04.920 --> 3:36:08.840]  Alex Jones the bottom of this report and have been posted by some of the videos
[3:36:08.840 --> 3:36:16.600]  and photos and it goes on to say Alex Jones syndicated radio talk show host
[3:36:16.600 --> 3:36:21.360]  documentary filmmaker says that he invited the Washington Post the Fairfax
[3:36:21.360 --> 3:36:25.240]  Times and asked 16 million listeners of Coast to Coast AM radio show to call on
[3:36:25.240 --> 3:36:30.280]  the press to can cover the event but no major media showed this is a criminal
[3:36:30.280 --> 3:36:32.960]  group they are involved in very bad things said Alex Jones referring to
[3:36:32.960 --> 3:36:36.360]  the Bilderberg group he said they violate the Logan Act the federal law says
[3:36:36.360 --> 3:36:40.440]  that they can't come here and discuss policy with private interest and secret
[3:36:40.440 --> 3:36:43.840]  because we have a right to know the only place they can discuss these things
[3:36:43.840 --> 3:36:47.040]  in secret is in a national security meeting in the Congress of the Capitol
[3:36:47.040 --> 3:36:52.200]  and that's amongst themselves this is illegal what they are doing that's why
[3:36:52.200 --> 3:36:58.320]  we have moles inside reporting to us what's happening man this is just real
[3:36:58.320 --> 3:37:01.160]  reporting here ladies and gentlemen everything he's saying is documented by
[3:37:01.160 --> 3:37:05.960]  the way by quoting me it's all proven he continued this isn't about the federal
[3:37:05.960 --> 3:37:08.680]  government this is about private interest meeting with members of the
[3:37:08.680 --> 3:37:11.960]  government outside of the government violating federal law on the Logan Act
[3:37:11.960 --> 3:37:15.440]  we are here because this is a criminal summit these are globalists they want
[3:37:15.440 --> 3:37:18.720]  one rule government they want to reduce liberty Alex Jones is also the
[3:37:18.720 --> 3:37:24.480]  producer of in-game blueprint for global enslavement when asked about evidence
[3:37:24.480 --> 3:37:28.200]  of Bilderberg groups influence over us presidential candidates he said from
[3:37:28.200 --> 3:37:31.240]  our sources they decide who they like best and they put their weight behind
[3:37:31.240 --> 3:37:35.240]  them these people on the media they own the big corporations they've got
[3:37:35.240 --> 3:37:41.720]  trillions of dollars together and they they get the nod from the big boys you
[3:37:41.720 --> 3:37:45.840]  tend to get the support do they have total control over society no they have
[3:37:45.840 --> 3:37:49.520]  total control over the candidates no but they are steering they are massively
[3:37:49.520 --> 3:37:53.520]  influencing it this is all word for word what I said the Washington Post
[3:37:53.520 --> 3:37:57.400]  publish an article on June 9th with the headline Obama advisor faces scrutiny
[3:37:57.400 --> 3:38:03.560]  over mortgage deals it reports that James J. Johnson former Fannie Mae CEO is
[3:38:03.560 --> 3:38:08.160]  leading Barack Obama's vice presidential search process and that
[3:38:08.160 --> 3:38:12.280]  Johnson is a former member of American friends of Bilderberg rare mention they
[3:38:12.280 --> 3:38:15.480]  at least mentioned it Jim Tucker co-founder of American Free Press has
[3:38:15.480 --> 3:38:18.800]  been investigating the Bilderberg group for over a quarter century his research
[3:38:18.800 --> 3:38:23.400]  of the Bilderberg group has been highly praised by participants of the protest
[3:38:23.400 --> 3:38:27.120]  at Chantilly he is author of Jim Tucker's Bilderberg diary 2005 John
[3:38:27.120 --> 3:38:30.040]  Ronson author of them describes Bilderberg group for seeing in several
[3:38:30.040 --> 3:38:36.680]  years ago he's a big white washer by the way many members of Bilderberg see
[3:38:36.680 --> 3:38:40.520]  themselves in watch the same way as the conspiracy theorists see them a shadowy
[3:38:40.520 --> 3:38:44.680]  figures out to influence world events they see themselves as wise globalist
[3:38:44.680 --> 3:38:49.240]  centrist yes centrist many of them anti-Bilderberg conspiracies see them as
[3:38:49.240 --> 3:38:53.640]  twigs in a title wave of globalization they see themselves as nationalist
[3:38:53.640 --> 3:38:57.400]  world government is what Bilderberg are into the idea of global community and a
[3:38:57.400 --> 3:39:02.000]  one-world order the Bilderberg group sees themselves as headhunters they'll get
[3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:05.400]  an up-and-coming politician who they think may be a presidential prime
[3:39:05.400 --> 3:39:09.920]  minister one day and as globalist and industrial leaders they try to influence
[3:39:09.920 --> 3:39:16.960]  them oh yeah right they run them Bilderberg's security how hulks back to
[3:39:16.960 --> 3:39:20.300]  Henry Kissinger who loves the idea of working in the shadows the secret he
[3:39:20.300 --> 3:39:23.600]  gives arrives to conspiracy theories no we've gotten their minutes out we know
[3:39:23.600 --> 3:39:28.000]  what their agenda is the CNN interview can be seen at YouTube here the press
[3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:31.000]  release for the official Bilderberg group that we forced them to release that's a
[3:39:31.000 --> 3:39:35.080]  big victory you can click on that or that he says the websites owned and run by
[3:39:35.080 --> 3:39:39.600]  Alex Jones show photos and videos on the Chantilly event info wars.com and
[3:39:39.600 --> 3:39:43.920]  prismplanet.com there appears to be a wide range of opinions about Bilderberg
[3:39:43.920 --> 3:39:48.640]  group this report represents only the tip of the iceberg really nice report he's
[3:39:48.640 --> 3:39:55.040]  got a group photo there of all of us out there and up at the top he's got a
[3:39:55.040 --> 3:40:00.440]  photo of me with other folks and we really appreciate the fine job that he
[3:40:00.440 --> 3:40:03.800]  did very accurate reporting everything he said he backed up with even their own
[3:40:03.800 --> 3:40:09.720]  admissions this is an excellent report so I am very excited I mean this is
[3:40:09.720 --> 3:40:14.040]  paper huge folks and it's not just the millions of people every day that
[3:40:14.040 --> 3:40:17.680]  read it who pick it up it's the millions of Falun Gong practitioners all over

[3:40:23.440 --> 3:40:26.960]  of a Buddhist exercise group most of them aren't even religious they get
[3:40:26.960 --> 3:40:30.240]  harvested for their organs a lot because they're so healthy the exercise
[3:40:30.240 --> 3:40:35.600]  about three hours a day eat only organic food work out all the time I think a
[3:40:35.600 --> 3:40:41.920]  really classy group of people I've had scum we posted a video the Epoch Times
[3:40:41.920 --> 3:40:46.720]  guy interviewing me Saturday or was it so Sunday and on YouTube people are
[3:40:46.720 --> 3:40:52.160]  going Falun Gong scum you need to die you're a bunch of anti-Chinese scum most
[3:40:52.160 --> 3:40:55.760]  of March Chinese by the way how are they anti-Chinese scum I'm just sick of the
[3:40:55.760 --> 3:41:00.520]  new world order man can't you send guys leave anybody alone that doesn't love
[3:41:00.520 --> 3:41:04.080]  your tyranny I'm gonna blast through a few phone calls and finish up without

[3:41:13.560 --> 3:41:18.360]  you said the Israeli government the American government just about every
[3:41:18.360 --> 3:41:23.080]  day been threatening an unprovoked aggression attack against Iran who has
[3:41:23.080 --> 3:41:29.120]  an attack to country you know since it was found as much as it's been
[3:41:29.120 --> 3:41:33.760]  overthrown twice by the U.S. and it's been invaded by the United States and
[3:41:33.760 --> 3:41:37.720]  over a million of more murdered and it's total evil and I'm not disagreeing with
[3:41:37.720 --> 3:41:44.920]  you well the point I like to make is is that I believe that anyone who says
[3:41:44.920 --> 3:41:50.320]  repeats this totally discredited quote that is endlessly repeated to the dumb
[3:41:50.320 --> 3:41:54.240]  down American public that which has been completely exploded all across yes
[3:41:54.240 --> 3:42:00.400]  Ahmed energy said the the regime of Zionism will be wiped from that will
[3:42:00.400 --> 3:42:04.960]  vanish from the history's pages and then that was falsely quoted and it's an
[3:42:04.960 --> 3:42:08.240]  absolute fact to say we will drive Israel into the sea and kill everybody
[3:42:08.240 --> 3:42:13.240]  that's absolutely true and they also had a letter to President Bush about two
[3:42:13.240 --> 3:42:16.680]  years ago let me just stop you do you know how far course he's come he's come
[3:42:16.680 --> 3:42:20.960]  from two years ago here believing all of it to saying they carried out 9-11
[3:42:20.960 --> 3:42:24.360]  we'll basically it's a new world order they control the left and the right I
[3:42:24.360 --> 3:42:28.280]  mean you know I respect course because he's right on economics right on peak
[3:42:28.280 --> 3:42:33.480]  oil right on so much but then and he's coming along I mean I really think he
[3:42:33.480 --> 3:42:37.440]  means well I don't think he's an operative well I think he is I absolutely
[3:42:37.440 --> 3:42:40.960]  do I think he's a poisonous chameleon who adopts the background camouflage of
[3:42:40.960 --> 3:42:44.640]  the people he's talking to at the time but the burning issue right now is to
[3:42:44.640 --> 3:42:48.720]  stop this war now he doesn't do that I'm gonna stop you let me stop you put him
[3:42:48.720 --> 3:42:52.680]  on hold I used to get in huge fights with course I'd have him on and scream at
[3:42:52.680 --> 3:42:56.840]  him they said on air okay you woke me up it's probably an inside job and then
[3:42:56.840 --> 3:43:00.680]  he's saying he doesn't want to work with Iran he did two years ago so I mean a
[3:43:00.680 --> 3:43:05.080]  chameleon he goes on other shows and says that what I'm saying what I'm
[3:43:05.080 --> 3:43:09.680]  saying is here he's sophisticated enough he knows even a semi-literate the
[3:43:09.680 --> 3:43:13.880]  person knows that that is a total lie the primary lie that is being used to
[3:43:13.880 --> 3:43:18.500]  almost call him on into this war and and furthermore I've heard him over the
[3:43:18.500 --> 3:43:22.520]  years going beyond that would actually make the neocons blush with the kind of
[3:43:22.520 --> 3:43:27.920]  a scaremongering propaganda on coast to coast framing up every country that has
[3:43:27.920 --> 3:43:33.640]  been attacked is set up for attack from Iran Iraq to Syria I absolutely believe
[3:43:33.640 --> 3:43:38.440]  a man of his sophistication knew exactly what he's doing because even Cheney
[3:43:38.440 --> 3:43:42.800]  Bush and McCain and these types would not make those kind of claims and I've
[3:43:42.800 --> 3:43:47.440]  heard him on another program first up at the check up people who want that
[3:43:47.440 --> 3:43:52.440]  quote verified global research dot CA but I've heard him on another program
[3:43:52.440 --> 3:43:58.480]  concerning Obama and he attacks him up for not being enough of a neoconduct
[3:43:58.480 --> 3:44:04.440]  but I have my condemnation of him for precisely look like John gotta move on
[3:44:04.440 --> 3:44:08.560]  but you have no argument for me I am not gonna vote for Barack Obama I'm not
[3:44:08.560 --> 3:44:13.120]  gonna vote for John McCain I appreciate your call okay I mean I'm not voting for
[3:44:13.120 --> 3:44:17.440]  either one there is you know it's kind of we went to a hamburger place and they
[3:44:17.440 --> 3:44:21.880]  said we're selling horse dung for dinner and they can say we got dried horse
[3:44:21.880 --> 3:44:26.320]  dung and we got wet horse dung well which pile of horse dung do you want to
[3:44:26.320 --> 3:44:31.200]  eat I'm gonna say I don't want horse dung on the menu I'm leaving now I
[3:44:31.200 --> 3:44:36.840]  personally have looked into Obama's eyes and seen glimmers of evil I have a
[3:44:36.840 --> 3:44:39.840]  pretty good discernment I think he's a total tool in the front with a lot of
[3:44:39.840 --> 3:44:44.080]  charisma I don't think he's that evil yet I don't like him but his handlers are
[3:44:44.080 --> 3:44:48.000]  pure evil I physically get ill when I look at Hilary I mean I literally turn
[3:44:48.000 --> 3:44:51.960]  away I mean her fakeness or evil I can't look at her McCain is a complete
[3:44:51.960 --> 3:44:57.600]  nutcase I can't look at him and I guess after many years of looking at Obama I
[3:44:57.600 --> 3:45:01.240]  get to where I'm nauseated I understand but it's I'm not discussing it I mean
[3:45:01.240 --> 3:45:04.680]  it's all a diversion it's all a distraction I think people should know
[3:45:04.680 --> 3:45:08.200]  about Obama we'll expose him and McCain but other than that I'm not going to
[3:45:08.200 --> 3:45:14.120]  vote for either one of them okay let's go to a daily on I believe North Carolina
[3:45:14.120 --> 3:45:21.960]  yeah yeah I'd like to bring up two points first is I've been noticing the
[3:45:21.960 --> 3:45:27.960]  presence of black and green helicopters in the area and not just in nuts in the
[3:45:27.960 --> 3:45:33.760]  city but also in the rural areas as well and I was wondering if there was some
[3:45:33.760 --> 3:45:36.640]  sort of literature on that big appointment I have to look at the
[3:45:36.640 --> 3:45:40.480]  aircraft I can tell you exactly what agency they're with okay and another
[3:45:40.480 --> 3:45:46.640]  thing I have a friend who received a threatened email in our inbox a few
[3:45:46.640 --> 3:45:50.880]  days ago and it turned out to be a phony email there was one of those emails
[3:45:50.880 --> 3:45:56.080]  says we're gonna kill you if you don't pay a thousand dollars in ten days yeah
[3:45:56.080 --> 3:46:00.960]  and I wanted to know have there been anyone who has successfully done a
[3:46:00.960 --> 3:46:07.120]  reverse don't reverse search on that on the email most of those get sent out by
[3:46:07.120 --> 3:46:12.600]  dummy Trojans that come and take over other people's computers okay we're like
[3:46:12.600 --> 3:46:16.880]  mainly it's institution computers like government facilities universities
[3:46:16.880 --> 3:46:21.440]  public school computers hackers dial into them a lot of it's the government
[3:46:21.440 --> 3:46:24.880]  that's been proven to create a bad name for the web so they can regulate it and
[3:46:24.880 --> 3:46:29.960]  then it'll take over your computer and then off of its server using it as a
[3:46:29.960 --> 3:46:33.640]  proxy and then they're using a proxy to get to your computer they will send out
[3:46:33.640 --> 3:46:36.480]  you know a thousand emails that then use and then they'll go get into other
[3:46:36.480 --> 3:46:40.080]  computers and do it and it's just all a big diversion all a big distraction I
[3:46:40.080 --> 3:46:44.200]  mean you'll know when you get a real phone call or a real email it'll say by
[3:46:44.200 --> 3:46:48.040]  your name you know they'll call up and say hey mr. Johnson or whatever your
[3:46:48.040 --> 3:46:52.320]  last name is you know we're gonna kill you and they really want you to know
[3:46:52.320 --> 3:46:55.000]  it's true they'll say you know that little dogs back there playing in the
[3:46:55.000 --> 3:47:01.240]  backyard chasing a squirrel what a cute little pink necklace it has how about I
[3:47:01.240 --> 3:47:04.600]  murdered that little dog like I'm gonna slit your throat you whore you hear me
[3:47:04.600 --> 3:47:09.040]  whore we're gonna cut your head off that's the kind of calls my wife's had
[3:47:09.040 --> 3:47:14.560]  before so you know that that's what it's like or you answer the phone and it's a
[3:47:14.560 --> 3:47:20.360]  woman going baby baby you gave me disease you gave me a disease and then
[3:47:20.360 --> 3:47:23.800]  they'll do it right when your wife's with you in the house and you hang up and
[3:47:23.800 --> 3:47:26.200]  your wife gets paranoid and they call the number back and you know it's some
[3:47:26.200 --> 3:47:30.040]  payphone the person's answering or they'll call your house and say is Alex
[3:47:30.040 --> 3:47:34.360]  there we'll know he's not there can leave me we'd like to message well I I thought
[3:47:34.360 --> 3:47:37.960]  he lives alone I I want to talk to him I need to talk to him well this is his
[3:47:37.960 --> 3:47:40.760]  wife leave the number well you can't have a wife we're together we're having a
[3:47:40.760 --> 3:47:47.240]  baby you know or or you know what if you want to know what a real Psyop is how
[3:47:47.240 --> 3:47:50.840]  about we burn your house down and kill your children you know that's the type
[3:47:50.840 --> 3:47:55.040]  of stuff and that's when you know the government is pure scum I mean the
[3:47:55.040 --> 3:47:59.080]  top echelons and now they've got sociopathic killers who've been
[3:47:59.080 --> 3:48:03.960]  murdering people in Iraq Afghanistan Serbia they're coming back a age of
[3:48:03.960 --> 3:48:08.800]  death and destruction and wickedness and just feeding on us and running wild on
[3:48:08.800 --> 3:48:12.640]  us is now in burning down governor's mansions and blaming it on people and
[3:48:12.640 --> 3:48:16.760]  just total wickedness is upon us and I just tell you if everybody you can
[3:48:16.760 --> 3:48:19.760]  discredit this government like your life depends on it because they've got a
[3:48:19.760 --> 3:48:22.920]  totally be discredited and we've almost done it so it just completely falls
[3:48:22.920 --> 3:48:26.880]  apart now instead of them going into pure fascism we have to just have it
[3:48:26.880 --> 3:48:32.080]  fall apart that's the best we can hope for was there any program that you
[3:48:32.080 --> 3:48:38.240]  recommend to prevent the takeover a program right now like anti-spy away
[3:48:38.240 --> 3:48:42.680]  anti-virus program you know just so what listen I appreciate your call I'm the
[3:48:42.680 --> 3:48:46.600]  tip of the spear here with a few other people I'm the big fish folks I'm alive

[3:48:53.520 --> 3:48:56.320]  being chased and that never really happens unless you went to Bilderberg
[3:48:56.320 --> 3:48:59.560]  all people did get visits from that because they want to intimidate people
[3:48:59.560 --> 3:49:05.960]  they want to stop it's excitement it's real life I mean most you look do they
[3:49:05.960 --> 3:49:09.200]  have army helicopters flying around with local police scanning through your
