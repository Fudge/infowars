[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:02.170]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.891]  It is the 10th day of June, 2008.
[00:00:03.891 --> 00:00:08.453]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.262]  Joining us in one hour is Dr. Jerome Corsi to discuss what's happening with the economy.
[00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:42.405]  He has a doctorate in economics, breaking down what's happening with oil, with the dollar, with gold, and a lot more.
[00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:54.109]  Continuing with the economic microscope, we will have in the third hour Bob Chapman, international forecaster, joining us for his weekly visit as well.
[00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.691]  We'll have open phones while both of those guests are on with us today.
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.593]  I also, before this hour ends, yesterday I did the first
[00:01:05.205 --> 00:01:09.187]  Two days of the Bilderberg Group meeting or arriving Tuesday, Wednesday.
[00:01:09.187 --> 00:01:14.810]  I got up in my chronological order until Thursday morning and then never got back to it.
[00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:25.196]  I want to kind of recap Tuesday and Wednesday hurriedly and then get into Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday in a chronological order of the basics of what I witnessed.
[00:01:25.196 --> 00:01:29.938]  I want to be clear to all the listeners tuning in that I thank you for your support.
[00:01:29.938 --> 00:01:31.379]  We couldn't do what we do without you.
[00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:33.460]  I thank you for all of your prayers.
[00:01:35.578 --> 00:01:45.041]  I know when we have riled up the power elite, and we've certainly done that, we've gotten more threatening calls, emails, things of that nature.
[00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:52.283]  We're trying to track those down and track down ISPs and file complaints and get the phone company to give us records from these unknown numbers.
[00:01:52.283 --> 00:01:57.164]  But I want to be clear, the Chantilly Marriott
[00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:08.833]  Where they met there in Virginia on the edge of DC is in the middle of a large wooded compound but areas of the conference halls, it's mainly a conference five-star hotel,
[00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:29.108]  Stick out right to the edge of the property line within about 30, not even 30 yards, 25 yards of the road, and getting up on the property line about 20 yards away, we had a giant industrial bullhorn that somebody brought out there, a great guy brought out, and we were blasting them during their conference.
[00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:32.932]  So imagine, I basically, and Luke Rudowsky and others that got on it,
[00:02:33.683 --> 00:02:35.163]  For hour after hour after hour.
[00:02:35.163 --> 00:02:44.266]  I mean, we probably bullhorned them 10 hours a day if you broke it all up from about 8, 9 in the morning until 10 at night when the sound ordinance kicked in and we couldn't bullhorn, which I think is reasonable.
[00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:47.908]  There's some neighborhoods in the area.
[00:02:47.908 --> 00:02:48.788]  It was just incredible.
[00:02:49.677 --> 00:02:51.357]  And I knew what I was doing.
[00:02:51.357 --> 00:02:57.759]  I knew that was the main conference hall because I'd been inside the hotel, and I knew what I was doing when I went ahead and opened up on them.
[00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:06.681]  I mean, I'm loud on a normal bullhorn, but on this gigantic one that's the equivalent of about four regular megaphones, it was shaking the windows.
[00:03:06.681 --> 00:03:16.123]  David Rockefeller, Queen Beatrix, the Queen of Spain, the Defense Secretary, Henry Kissinger, all of them in there, and literally taking over their meeting.
[00:03:16.123 --> 00:03:18.424]  Richard N. Haas came out and stared at us with hatred.
[00:03:19.775 --> 00:03:27.744]  They would have the Secret Service would come over and try to order the police to kick us off of the right-of-way there on the side of the road to make us go across the street.
[00:03:27.744 --> 00:03:28.985]  We refused.
[00:03:28.985 --> 00:03:31.688]  Bilderberg didn't want to make a scene, so they had to give in to us.
[00:03:31.688 --> 00:03:35.653]  And they are very, very mad.
[00:03:35.653 --> 00:03:37.254]  And I knew what I was doing when I did it, but...
[00:03:38.582 --> 00:03:40.364]  Man, I mean, they are angry.
[00:03:40.364 --> 00:03:41.265]  They are upset.
[00:03:41.265 --> 00:03:44.007]  We actually took over the Bilderberg Group meeting.
[00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:47.671]  I hope listeners understand the magnitude of what's happened.
[00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:55.218]  We were bullhorning them from 8 in the morning till 10 at night, night after night, day after day after day after day.
[00:03:55.976 --> 00:04:02.359]  With scores of people getting on the megaphone, going through battery pack after battery pack after battery pack.
[00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.160]  All told, there were probably six, seven different megaphones out there.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.482]  Two medium-sized ones, a couple of big ones, and one giant jumbo.
[00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:14.045]  And the jumbo was running continually with people on it.
[00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:21.168]  I bullhorned them probably two hours a day myself, if you count all the bullhorning sessions I did for 20, 30 minutes at a time.
[00:04:21.168 --> 00:04:23.409]  Blew out my voice, you can tell it's even more raspy.
[00:04:24.252 --> 00:04:26.033]  You understand what's happened here.
[00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:28.535]  We took over the Bilderberg group meeting.
[00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:30.096]  They are threatening me.
[00:04:30.096 --> 00:04:37.241]  They are calling my wife a dirty tricks and talking about burning down my house and things like that.
[00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:38.842]  It is just amazing.
[00:04:38.842 --> 00:04:43.546]  So, I do think we deserve a little bit of respect out there for what we've done.
[00:04:43.546 --> 00:04:44.706]  Everybody that did it.
[00:04:44.706 --> 00:04:48.169]  But especially me, because my name's on the headline.
[00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.670]  I mean, I'm the one they blame.
[00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.872]  And I guess I deserve all the blame, Bilderberg.
[00:04:52.872 --> 00:04:53.533]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:53.533 --> 00:04:53.893]  Stay with me.
[00:04:54.508 --> 00:04:55.929]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:58.751]  A New World Order.
[00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:03.634]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:03.634 --> 00:05:06.476]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:06.476 --> 00:05:09.258]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:09.258 --> 00:05:12.441]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:19.766]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:22.796 --> 00:05:28.240]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.102]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:32.102 --> 00:05:34.664]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:34.664 --> 00:05:35.825]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:35.825 --> 00:05:36.625]  They're not after money.
[00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:37.906]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:37.906 --> 00:05:38.887]  They're after power.
[00:05:38.887 --> 00:05:40.028]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:08:06.007 --> 00:08:10.849]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.849 --> 00:08:16.732]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:16.732 --> 00:08:20.314]  You understand the huge victory we've had in the Info War?
[00:08:23.058 --> 00:08:31.041]  You had world leaders trying to set the agenda on banking, on oil, energy, war, on the cashless society control grid.
[00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:33.482]  Our inside sources have confirmed that.
[00:08:33.482 --> 00:08:40.084]  We are engaging in intelligence gathering against those that are destroying the sovereignty of our country.
[00:08:40.084 --> 00:08:50.547]  We went through hell and back being harassed, being people trying to set us up, people threatening us, people getting visited at their homes by military intelligence, by Marines, by
[00:08:53.004 --> 00:09:02.552]  Diplomatic Security Service, which is Marines in plain clothes, people following us around in clown masks in their cars so we couldn't videotape their faces.
[00:09:02.552 --> 00:09:06.416]  We bullhorned dozens of hours a day.
[00:09:06.416 --> 00:09:15.944]  I mean, it was just massive at weak points where the conference center backed up onto a main road in Chantilly.
[00:09:16.886 --> 00:09:20.228]  We have gone in and taken over the Bilderberg Group meeting.
[00:09:20.228 --> 00:09:27.733]  We have gone in and taken over while they were having their secret conference, where they fill up a meeting hall, where they have big roundtable discussions.
[00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:29.614]  Do you understand what we've done?
[00:09:29.614 --> 00:09:34.637]  A daring info-raid, a daring resistance to these people.
[00:09:34.637 --> 00:09:37.839]  When they were driving out, when they were driving in, they weren't glaring at us.
[00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:44.263]  When they were driving out, Vernon Jordan and many others and the Secret Service were glaring at us.
[00:09:44.263 --> 00:09:44.643]  Also,
[00:09:45.598 --> 00:09:58.702]  There are video stills up on the web, and now photos up on the web, that clearly show the M4, or some of them, it appeared to me, had the type of the buttstock that I've seen on MP5s.
[00:09:58.702 --> 00:10:06.665]  But regardless, submachine guns, and they would lift them up, they would drive up, turn their bodies towards us, and lift them up, and show us their guns.
[00:10:06.665 --> 00:10:08.105]  I saw the full guns.
[00:10:08.988 --> 00:10:09.568]  Okay?
[00:10:09.568 --> 00:10:13.571]  Your eyes are quicker and more easily trained on guns than video cameras.
[00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:16.193]  You've got to get them on and then focus them.
[00:10:16.193 --> 00:10:26.440]  But people are in denial there that Secret Service and others would have guns bringing in Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State, Connelisa Rice and Gates and others.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:32.564]  But yes, we had them brandishing those at us, looking at us with absolute, total hatred.
[00:10:33.141 --> 00:10:38.624]  We are the enemy because we don't like 3 trillion going into a black hole in Iraq into their pockets.
[00:10:38.624 --> 00:10:43.286]  We don't like 4 trillion missing from the Pentagon coffers over the last 8 years.
[00:10:43.286 --> 00:10:45.367]  We don't like all the corruption.
[00:10:45.367 --> 00:10:48.008]  We don't like the North American Union.
[00:10:48.008 --> 00:10:52.450]  We would dare go there and expose these people and ruin their meeting.
[00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:58.193]  And when they came out, they looked... I mean, Verdon Jordan looked right at me for about 5 seconds as he drove up and around.
[00:11:00.145 --> 00:11:07.793]  And he just looked at me with absolute disgusted hatred and fear.
[00:11:07.793 --> 00:11:10.376]  It was a very, very intense look.
[00:11:10.376 --> 00:11:21.248]  He locked right on to me and again I had all the secret police and the rest of them coming up talking to me by name, asking me about my family, the rest of it.
[00:11:22.573 --> 00:11:25.055]  I've had Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger Group, on.
[00:11:25.055 --> 00:11:31.422]  He told me off-air, John Harmon heard it all, that, yeah, we all know who you are, and that's why I'm coming on to counter you.
[00:11:31.422 --> 00:11:32.984]  Folks, this is a pretty big deal.
[00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:36.688]  Do you know what it's like to have world leaders know who you are?
[00:11:36.688 --> 00:11:41.273]  Do you know what it's like to have the opportunity to know they're meeting in that hall?
[00:11:42.719 --> 00:11:49.064]  Just 25 yards away and to bullhorn them for hour after hour in 110 degree index heat.
[00:11:49.064 --> 00:11:53.046]  100 degree heat, but 110 degree index.
[00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:56.049]  But the local news reported to sit there and to do it.
[00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:59.371]  I mean, I just got to say the people that showed up have amazing courage.
[00:11:59.371 --> 00:12:00.552]  It wasn't courage with me.
[00:12:00.552 --> 00:12:07.917]  I cannot turn down an opportunity to get in their face, to let them know this is a major psychological warfare blow against them.
[00:12:07.917 --> 00:12:09.018]  They were shooken up.
[00:12:09.954 --> 00:12:14.978]  And I'm told from inside sources that it really upset their meeting and upset their apple cart.
[00:12:14.978 --> 00:12:16.559]  I don't know what they're going to do to me.
[00:12:16.559 --> 00:12:17.160]  Audits?
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.220]  Harassment?
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.481]  Are they going to kill me?
[00:12:19.481 --> 00:12:22.264]  Are they going to set me up?
[00:12:22.264 --> 00:12:29.969]  I just, if they kill me, if they set me up, know the disinfo agents will say all sorts of lies about me on the web, posing as patriots.
[00:12:29.969 --> 00:12:32.951]  They've only intensified their efforts.
[00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:38.976]  And it isn't even about Alex Jones, but I don't want the symbol that I've become and the symbol that InfoWars has become.
[00:12:39.747 --> 00:12:40.587]  To be tainted.
[00:12:40.587 --> 00:12:50.931]  I don't want them to be successful, and I'm asking you, the listeners, to counter all the disinfo agents that lie about us, and try to discredit us, and try to say we're agents.
[00:12:50.931 --> 00:12:54.072]  I don't want them to turn new minds off.
[00:12:54.072 --> 00:13:07.557]  Last night I was on my Myspace watching a clip about people that attacked me, and they were admitting, oh yeah, we go out and hand out our material, and everybody's heard of the other, you know, conspiracy material, and it makes it easier for us, but the other conspiracy guys, they're government agents, basically.
[00:13:08.434 --> 00:13:11.237]  You've answered your own question, showing that you're idiots.
[00:13:11.237 --> 00:13:13.759]  I mean, let's say some of you aren't government agents.
[00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:19.003]  You're just jealous of us, and envious of us, and jealous of the work we do, and you want to be the leaders.
[00:13:19.003 --> 00:13:20.445]  Fine, be leaders.
[00:13:20.445 --> 00:13:30.273]  But don't say, yeah, we've opened the door for you, and we've woken up millions of people, and because we don't totally agree with your analysis, that we're agents.
[00:13:30.273 --> 00:13:31.494]  Look at the fruit.
[00:13:31.494 --> 00:13:33.296]  Look at how many people we've woken up.
[00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:49.925]  I talked to even my detractors, some of which are not agents, they're just well-meaning dupes and fools or jealous of our work, and they'll admit, yeah, 9 out of 10 people they talk to that are awake to the New World Order are awake because of one individual.
[00:13:49.925 --> 00:13:52.548]  His name is Alex Jones.
[00:13:52.548 --> 00:13:54.650]  Now, I'm not even particularly proud of that.
[00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:55.591]  I'm just doing my duty.
[00:13:56.773 --> 00:14:03.456]  It's literally burrowing a hole towards my destruction the closer I get to defeating them.
[00:14:03.456 --> 00:14:06.557]  The closer I get to unlocking minds, the more effective I get.
[00:14:06.557 --> 00:14:08.118]  But I can't help it.
[00:14:08.118 --> 00:14:15.021]  I knew when I bullhorned the conference hall from 20-25 yards away that I was putting my life in my hands.
[00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:18.043]  That I was really on the edge of the razor blade.
[00:14:18.043 --> 00:14:19.503]  On the edge of the precipice.
[00:14:19.503 --> 00:14:24.526]  I knew when Haas came out and looked at me with red-faced, stern hatred.
[00:14:24.526 --> 00:14:25.486]  Focused hatred.
[00:14:26.112 --> 00:14:30.373]  You know, he had a straight face with the eyes burned with murderous hatred.
[00:14:30.373 --> 00:14:46.776]  I knew, especially then, I had an adrenaline rush, a pang that you have when you stand on the edge of a cliff, and I just turned it on even more, and attacked Haas, and called him out by name, and I announced who I was, just like John Hancock, signing his name at the top of the list and as big as he could.
[00:14:46.776 --> 00:14:53.017]  I have put my name, my blood, my treasure, my family, everything on the line.
[00:14:54.944 --> 00:15:06.835]  And I just ask the people out there that constantly attack me and constantly exaggerate and constantly twist and constantly lie to be more reasonable.
[00:15:06.835 --> 00:15:09.617]  I know most of you out there aren't agents.
[00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:19.005]  It's a diseased modern mind that just constantly ninny and fight and complain and say you should have got video with this, you should have not said that.
[00:15:19.005 --> 00:15:19.586]  You know what?
[00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:20.767]  I'm at least in the arena.
[00:15:22.327 --> 00:15:32.235]  Now I know there's a lot of disinfo people that our government, that's been admitted, we've tracked back their IPs and they even have admitted their handles and we've gone to their other accounts and they kind of start the ball rolling.
[00:15:32.235 --> 00:15:42.364]  A few key disinfo agents out there and again every time I mention this people think that I'm bringing this up because I'm being hurt or oh they're getting to me.
[00:15:42.364 --> 00:15:43.765]  That is not what's happening.
[00:15:43.765 --> 00:15:48.349]  I want you to understand I've been doing this longer than a lot of you have.
[00:15:48.349 --> 00:15:51.151]  I want you to understand I have great discernment.
[00:15:51.601 --> 00:15:53.162]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[00:15:53.162 --> 00:15:57.243]  Doesn't mean I even use my discernment or articulate the things I understand.
[00:15:57.243 --> 00:16:03.245]  It's that I want to be effective and I want you to be right beside me and behind me and in front of me.
[00:16:03.245 --> 00:16:05.366]  I want to work with everybody.
[00:16:05.366 --> 00:16:06.906]  I want to win.
[00:16:06.906 --> 00:16:08.547]  I want to bring down the New World Order.
[00:16:08.547 --> 00:16:18.270]  That is my goal and the enemy is very good at picking at us and getting us to fight with each other and getting us to argue with each other and getting us to do all these things.
[00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:23.409]  I don't even know why I'm getting off into this now.
[00:16:23.409 --> 00:16:24.890]  There's a lot of news here I want to get to.
[00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:29.815]  It's just that we have to stay focused on the New World Order.
[00:16:29.815 --> 00:16:41.267]  If we go out and we talk to the public about the central banks and how they're private and how they're destroying the dollars, they can come in and buy up assets cheaper and also destroy the middle class so that we're dependent on government.
[00:16:41.267 --> 00:16:41.648]  If we
[00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:49.974]  Expose how there's a shadow government, a secret group controlling both parties, then people will look for real solutions.
[00:16:49.974 --> 00:16:52.216]  We have to do the basics.
[00:16:52.216 --> 00:16:59.681]  If we have to teach people the basics first, before we, and then on their own, they will come to deeper understandings.
[00:16:59.681 --> 00:17:02.402]  They will come to deeper nuances.
[00:17:02.402 --> 00:17:06.125]  One reason, more subtle nuances, more details,
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.940]  And that's what I do.
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:18.882]  I try to bring out the general, basic knowledge, and then bring guests on who analyze certain specific sectors of the New World Order.
[00:17:18.882 --> 00:17:22.603]  And literally, knocking open the gates of the enemy citadels.
[00:17:22.603 --> 00:17:24.663]  I mean, look at the fruits we've borne.
[00:17:24.663 --> 00:17:26.943]  Look at how many people we've woken up.
[00:17:26.943 --> 00:17:29.464]  Look at how we have expanded this movement.
[00:17:29.464 --> 00:17:34.305]  Look at how our listeners, and then the people that visit InfoWars.com and PrisonBot.com.
[00:17:34.305 --> 00:17:35.385]  We are the vanguard.
[00:17:35.385 --> 00:17:36.285]  We are the front line.
[00:17:37.006 --> 00:17:40.968]  We are there at the Global Elite meeting bullhorning them.
[00:17:40.968 --> 00:17:43.069]  We are here getting real threats.
[00:17:43.069 --> 00:17:44.871]  We are here going through the fire.
[00:17:44.871 --> 00:17:52.075]  We are here taking, you know, the major blows for everybody else.
[00:17:52.075 --> 00:17:57.678]  And I want you, those of you out there, to realize this is not about Alex Jones.
[00:17:57.678 --> 00:18:02.200]  This is not about... I know you're sick of hearing about me, some of you out there who want to be leaders.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.982]  I know that you're in the growing stages of becoming leaders.
[00:18:05.769 --> 00:18:23.296]  And I understand that a lot of you have been very, very negative and have basically Monday morning quarterback or backseat driven a lot of things, but I'm just here to tell you that no one can look at the work we've done and not said that it's been amazing.
[00:18:23.296 --> 00:18:29.219]  No one can look at the work we've done and not said that we've unlocked hundreds of millions of minds.
[00:18:29.219 --> 00:18:34.101]  No one can look at the work we've done and can say that we are not doing good.
[00:18:34.818 --> 00:18:39.361]  And that we are not exposing the New World Order crime syndicate.
[00:18:39.361 --> 00:18:47.707]  Because this is a radio show on scores of AM and FM mom-and-pop stand-alone stations across the country.
[00:18:47.707 --> 00:18:52.670]  And we have shortwave and internet and satellite because of the supporters that support us.
[00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.691]  And we are exponentially reaching more people.
[00:18:54.691 --> 00:18:57.253]  We have exploded.
[00:18:57.253 --> 00:19:00.355]  Our growth curve is exponential and we are in the danger zone.
[00:19:01.289 --> 00:19:04.631]  We are in the danger zone, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:04.631 --> 00:19:12.055]  We are in the thick of the flack, right over the enemy New World Order complex, right over their military industrial complex.
[00:19:12.055 --> 00:19:13.296]  We are hitting them hard.
[00:19:13.296 --> 00:19:14.816]  We are hitting them hard.
[00:19:14.816 --> 00:19:16.577]  We are in at point-blank range.
[00:19:16.577 --> 00:19:23.441]  Every missile we fire, every bomb we drop in the info war is wrecking the enemy, is blowing huge holes in them.
[00:19:24.256 --> 00:19:39.929]  And all I'm asking you to do is come in with a positive, aggressive attitude of we're gonna win, we're gonna expose the New World Order, we're gonna discredit the government, we're gonna expose their illegitimacy, and we're going to take this planet back for humanity and future generations.
[00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:53.440]  I am committed, I am sworn to fight the New World Order, and I'm just asking all of you to be positive, to be focused, to be strong, and to come together, and forget our differences, and just fight together, side by side.
[00:19:55.424 --> 00:19:58.106]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:58.106 --> 00:20:07.573]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:07.573 --> 00:20:14.659]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:15.399 --> 00:20:21.386]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:32.158]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:32.939 --> 00:20:33.559]  We're good to go.
[00:20:54.335 --> 00:20:57.197]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:20:57.197 --> 00:20:58.758]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:00.900]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.821]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:02.821 --> 00:21:04.302]  The late great USA.
[00:21:04.302 --> 00:21:06.063]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:21:06.063 --> 00:21:13.108]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:21:51.464 --> 00:21:52.925]  Join the info war today!
[00:21:55.595 --> 00:21:57.057]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:57.057 --> 00:22:03.103]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:22:03.103 --> 00:22:03.924]  That's right.
[00:22:03.924 --> 00:22:06.767]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:22:06.767 --> 00:22:13.695]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:22:14.235 --> 00:22:22.380]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:27.863]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:22:27.863 --> 00:22:33.667]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:33.667 --> 00:22:38.190]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.470]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.291]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:22:43.533 --> 00:22:43.814]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:43.814 --> 00:22:44.014]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:54.022 --> 00:22:57.803]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[00:22:57.803 --> 00:23:02.505]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[00:23:02.505 --> 00:23:07.807]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[00:23:07.807 --> 00:23:19.031]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[00:23:19.031 --> 00:23:21.392]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[00:23:21.792 --> 00:23:23.834]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[00:23:23.834 --> 00:23:24.754]  Let's face it.
[00:23:24.754 --> 00:23:27.597]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[00:23:27.597 --> 00:23:35.603]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[00:23:35.603 --> 00:23:37.905]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:23:37.905 --> 00:23:41.027]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:23:41.027 --> 00:23:45.090]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.272]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:23:47.272 --> 00:23:49.634]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:23:50.094 --> 00:23:51.515]  And it's safe for all cars.
[00:23:51.515 --> 00:23:57.501]  Act now.
[00:23:57.501 --> 00:24:08.652]  Let me talk about somebody that's effective.
[00:24:08.652 --> 00:24:12.896]  He got a marketing public relations degree.
[00:24:12.896 --> 00:24:14.157]  He's Mark Dice.
[00:24:14.157 --> 00:24:15.178]  You knew him as John Connor.
[00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:23.078]  He decided to spot all the danger just to go public and use his real name.
[00:24:23.078 --> 00:24:26.460]  He knows how to bait the mainstream media.
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:31.282]  All of you can learn these tricks.
[00:24:31.282 --> 00:24:35.203]  And we don't even really communicate except maybe once every few months.
[00:24:35.203 --> 00:24:43.847]  I just learned minutes ago that he's starting a campaign to send 9-11 truth DVDs like Terror Storm in-game.
[00:24:44.696 --> 00:24:49.018]  Loose change, final cut to troops in Iraq.
[00:24:49.018 --> 00:24:51.559]  And Fox News went completely ape.
[00:24:51.559 --> 00:24:53.500]  By the way, Network, we just sent you that clip.
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.841]  I want to play some of that audio when Mark comes up in the next segment.
[00:24:56.647 --> 00:24:58.368]  This is the type of thing we're talking about.
[00:24:58.368 --> 00:25:01.349]  Things that are effective in multiple facets.
[00:25:01.349 --> 00:25:06.951]  It is very effective to wake up police and military because if tyranny is going to come to your door, it's going to come in a uniform.
[00:25:06.951 --> 00:25:19.296]  We've got to unlock their minds, show them the big picture, not let them be corrupted by the New World Order, try to take their souls back from the New World Order, try to wake them up, try to get them back on the side of goodness and honor.
[00:25:19.296 --> 00:25:25.198]  Most of them are good, evidenced by Ron Paul getting 70 plus percent of all the Republican donations from the troops.
[00:25:25.911 --> 00:25:28.573]  More than all Republican candidates combined.
[00:25:28.573 --> 00:25:33.155]  More than Barack Obama on the Democratic side, or Hillary individually.
[00:25:33.155 --> 00:25:35.397]  They're good men and women, most of them.
[00:25:35.397 --> 00:25:36.878]  The dark side's tried to twist them.
[00:25:36.878 --> 00:25:38.338]  Some of them now are waking up.
[00:25:38.338 --> 00:25:41.280]  Some of them were partially seduced.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.101]  But what did he do?
[00:25:42.101 --> 00:25:44.502]  Sending DVDs, which he's just putting the idea out.
[00:25:44.502 --> 00:25:45.683]  You can all do it.
[00:25:45.683 --> 00:25:49.465]  He's posted ways to do it on theresistancemanifesto.com.
[00:25:49.465 --> 00:25:54.388]  But then, it has the double effect of the mainstream media going absolutely ape!
[00:25:56.201 --> 00:25:59.103]  We know how to counter the New World Order.
[00:25:59.103 --> 00:26:01.765]  We understand their attack profile.
[00:26:01.765 --> 00:26:04.626]  We understand the enemy's operations.
[00:26:04.626 --> 00:26:10.430]  And if you will move against them, nothing can stop us.
[00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:14.613]  The creator of the universe is on our side.
[00:26:14.613 --> 00:26:16.294]  Had an atheist professor calling yesterday.
[00:26:16.294 --> 00:26:17.354]  He's written some well-known books.
[00:26:17.354 --> 00:26:18.035]  I'm gonna get him on the show.
[00:26:18.035 --> 00:26:20.096]  And he said, I couldn't help it when you were saying pray for you.
[00:26:20.096 --> 00:26:20.516]  I did.
[00:26:20.516 --> 00:26:21.297]  I could, I could feel it.
[00:26:22.637 --> 00:26:24.038]  It's real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:24.038 --> 00:26:25.699]  The enemy knows it's real.
[00:26:25.699 --> 00:26:28.840]  The enemy is into a dark energy force.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:34.263]  We are into love, and decency, and honor, and creativity.
[00:26:34.263 --> 00:26:39.626]  They are into destruction, and pain, and sorrow, and terror.
[00:26:39.626 --> 00:26:41.367]  Massive developments after Mark joins us.
[00:26:41.367 --> 00:26:46.410]  He's at work, so he can only join us for about 10 minutes.
[00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.692]  In between being a furniture salesman, he fights the New World Order.
[00:26:50.296 --> 00:26:59.402]  Video shows someone near governor's mansion before fire DPS officials trying to determine how at least one person might have entered the property and if others are involved.
[00:26:59.402 --> 00:27:12.790]  They've been caught lying the DPS it looks like 18 minutes after the fire was reported and the local fire department APD say yes that the individual we interviewed yesterday we went out to the governor's mansion that's up on YouTube.
[00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:13.651]  He's a listener by the way.
[00:27:15.043 --> 00:27:23.968]  That he reported it first walking back from a live music event with his wife parked in a parking lot nearby 18 minutes roughly after he reported 15 to 20.
[00:27:23.968 --> 00:27:26.529]  The news is saying 18.
[00:27:26.529 --> 00:27:35.814]  The fire trucks arrived then the state police who were garrisoned in a building literally 50 yards from where the fire was on the front porch.
[00:27:35.814 --> 00:27:39.715]  We also have the DPS lying and saying they called 9-1-1 first.
[00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:48.515]  The Austin Police Department and the Fire Department are saying it is not true.
[00:27:48.515 --> 00:27:52.158]  They received no call from them until at least 15 minutes after.
[00:27:52.158 --> 00:27:57.763]  And they responded again the Fire Department 15 plus minutes after.
[00:27:57.763 --> 00:27:59.445]  That's police response time for the Fire Department.
[00:28:00.245 --> 00:28:01.886]  The point is they did a great job.
[00:28:01.886 --> 00:28:06.711]  The point is the state police, and it's in the front page of the paper today, have been caught lying.
[00:28:06.711 --> 00:28:10.414]  I was out there yesterday, they were acting extremely guilty-faced.
[00:28:10.414 --> 00:28:16.719]  I'm not saying the state police out there guarding the governor's mansion are involved individually, I'm saying there's a cover-up.
[00:28:16.719 --> 00:28:26.848]  They not only had the big, nine-foot, wrought-iron, spiked-topped fence, with individual trees having four cameras apiece in them,
[00:28:27.651 --> 00:28:31.052]  I have no idea how many cameras, I'm guesstimating 50.
[00:28:31.052 --> 00:28:39.933]  The Capitol across the street with a huge garrison of at least 30, when I looked it up, 30 State Police at any one time over there.
[00:28:39.933 --> 00:28:45.754]  The State Police, Capitol Police garrison there and at the Governor's Mansion.
[00:28:45.754 --> 00:28:49.635]  And then they lied and said they called 911 when they did not.
[00:28:49.635 --> 00:28:52.655]  A huge fire.
[00:28:52.655 --> 00:28:54.316]  Burning.
[00:28:54.316 --> 00:28:55.876]  From the time it got called in.
[00:28:55.876 --> 00:28:56.436]  For 18 minutes.
[00:28:57.679 --> 00:29:00.161]  Clearly burning before that.
[00:29:00.161 --> 00:29:03.303]  And nothing happened.
[00:29:03.303 --> 00:29:19.015]  Garrisoned, there is a large building on the property, right beside the Governor's Mansion, which is their surveillance building, and where they stay and where they have a lunchroom.
[00:29:19.015 --> 00:29:25.440]  So we'll be getting into the Texas Governor's Mansion, which was the White House for the nation of Texas, the Republic of Texas.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.461]  Sam Houston lived there.
[00:29:28.124 --> 00:29:36.932]  And we're to believe someone didn't just scale the rod arm, they had another 10-foot security fence up around it for construction.
[00:29:36.932 --> 00:29:38.573]  Two fences!
[00:29:38.573 --> 00:29:40.275]  They scaled it and set it on fire?
[00:29:40.275 --> 00:29:44.639]  And then the state police stood down?
[00:29:44.639 --> 00:29:46.040]  We're on the march.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.562]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.562 --> 00:29:51.244]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:58.051]  Moving on to other news.
[00:32:58.051 --> 00:33:01.593]  Imagine that you are a soldier stationed in Iraq.
[00:33:01.593 --> 00:33:04.635]  Mail call comes around and you've got a letter from back home.
[00:33:04.635 --> 00:33:07.017]  But it is not from your family or your friends.
[00:33:07.017 --> 00:33:14.181]  It is a letter telling you that you are a pawn in the service of the quote, New World Order.
[00:33:14.181 --> 00:33:18.784]  And that you are risking your life for a government that helped carry out the 9-11 attacks.
[00:33:20.405 --> 00:33:21.546]  This is not a joke.
[00:33:21.546 --> 00:33:24.127]  This is actually happening.
[00:33:24.127 --> 00:33:29.349]  These letters are the work of Mark Dice, the founder of a group called The Resistance.
[00:33:29.349 --> 00:33:33.411]  Mark joins us live now, along with Captain Pete Hegseth.
[00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:38.914]  Pete is a National Guardsman who served in Iraq, and he is the Executive Director of Vets for Freedom.
[00:33:38.914 --> 00:33:39.915]  Good morning, gentlemen.
[00:33:39.915 --> 00:33:41.375]  Good morning.
[00:33:41.375 --> 00:33:43.256]  Mark, let me start with you.
[00:33:43.256 --> 00:33:46.298]  Do you think this is helpful to our troops serving on the ground in Iraq?
[00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:54.632]  I think that it's very beneficial that we inform them as to the true circumstances that got them in the situation that they're in.
[00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:56.252]  How does it help the troops?
[00:33:56.252 --> 00:34:05.114]  I think that if they're able to make better decisions based on the facts, that they can decide to direct their lives and their careers and the positions and the direction that they want to go.
[00:34:05.114 --> 00:34:12.576]  I think feeding them a constant stream of propaganda is one of the most detrimental things to them and to our service.
[00:34:12.576 --> 00:34:13.596]  What do you want them to do?
[00:34:13.596 --> 00:34:14.636]  Abandon the war?
[00:34:14.636 --> 00:34:15.817]  To just walk off the battlefield?
[00:34:17.355 --> 00:34:19.356]  We want them to join the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:34:19.356 --> 00:34:25.300]  We want them to ask their superiors hard and compelling questions about the circumstances of 9-11.
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:29.563]  Is that the role of an American soldier?
[00:34:29.563 --> 00:34:34.567]  Well, we want them to get the leadership to start thinking about what it is that they're sending these troops into.
[00:34:34.567 --> 00:34:41.211]  Look, everybody knows that the troops are so angry that they've been put in that position based on lies.
[00:34:41.211 --> 00:34:45.594]  Ron Paul had the largest donations from the troops themselves.
[00:34:46.034 --> 00:34:53.321]  The troops, no, I personally know United States Marines, active Marines who've served in Iraq, who know that 9-11's an inside job.
[00:34:53.321 --> 00:34:58.246]  We're trying to get the word out to as many people as possible and not keep them with the wool over their eyes.
[00:34:58.246 --> 00:35:07.775]  Pete, does he... Pete, does Mark accurately characterize... Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, this is pure info war for the Republic.
[00:35:08.846 --> 00:35:15.332]  I wish I would have thought of this idea, but that's why I'm glad there's other great minds out there, in case they imprison me, kill me, set me up.
[00:35:15.332 --> 00:35:17.413]  I feel good going to sleep at night.
[00:35:17.413 --> 00:35:24.239]  In fact, just two nights ago, I was going to sleep, getting back from Bilderberg, and I thought, who is there out there fighting the New World Order?
[00:35:24.239 --> 00:35:26.281]  And I thought of Mark Dice, I thought of Mark Kornke.
[00:35:27.522 --> 00:35:38.726]  I thought of just a handful of other people, Officer Jack McClam, I thought of Pastor Butch Paw, I thought of Luke Rodowski, I thought of just a handful of other people.
[00:35:38.726 --> 00:35:42.087]  Now if something happens to me, who would take my place at the head of the spear?
[00:35:42.745 --> 00:35:43.005]  I don't know.
[00:36:10.407 --> 00:36:10.747]  You know what?
[00:36:29.819 --> 00:36:33.465]  Wanted to go with the resistance covertly, but now he is out in the open.
[00:36:33.465 --> 00:36:35.068]  No longer wearing the dark sunshades.
[00:36:35.068 --> 00:36:36.911]  We commend his courage.
[00:36:36.911 --> 00:36:38.714]  Mark, another super idea.
[00:36:38.714 --> 00:36:40.116]  A. When did you think of this?
[00:36:40.116 --> 00:36:41.798]  B. Tell us about the program.
[00:36:41.798 --> 00:36:43.842]  And then C. Tell us about the Fox News appearance.
[00:36:44.864 --> 00:36:45.825]  I thought of it last week.
[00:36:45.825 --> 00:36:51.049]  There was a guest speaker at our church that had organized a program where people could write to U.S.
[00:36:51.049 --> 00:36:54.071]  troops stationed in Iraq, and I just thought, what a great idea.
[00:36:54.071 --> 00:37:02.457]  Instead of just writing them some nonsense about what's going on in the pop culture world, I thought we could send them some DVDs of Terror Storm, Loose Change, Final Cut, and others.
[00:37:02.952 --> 00:37:06.275]  And again, you need to go and sign up with an Adopt-A-Soldier program.
[00:37:06.275 --> 00:37:08.257]  There's links through on my website.
[00:37:08.257 --> 00:37:11.480]  You need to get a specific name and address of a soldier.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.502]  You can't just send a random package in.
[00:37:13.502 --> 00:37:16.825]  So there's free services that will put you into contact with a soldier.
[00:37:17.475 --> 00:37:23.879]  And it's a good idea not to mark the package, or if you're going to send out a DVD, don't send it in the package or in the box.
[00:37:23.879 --> 00:37:28.162]  They'll look at the package and see that the DVD is going to cause problems.
[00:37:28.162 --> 00:37:31.084]  So just send a DVD or a burned copy into them.
[00:37:31.084 --> 00:37:39.069]  And it's a great day when some truth and some accurate information can slip through the mockingbirds and the gatekeepers on Fox News and get to the masses.
[00:37:39.069 --> 00:37:46.434]  It's also important, I think, to load the films on thumb drives and with just a note saying, watch this important info.
[00:37:47.515 --> 00:37:49.458]  Uh, because a lot of them have computers.
[00:37:49.458 --> 00:37:51.360]  They don't have DVD players.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.483]  But a lot of the computers do have DVD players.
[00:37:53.483 --> 00:37:55.746]  You know, send it in multiple formats.
[00:37:55.746 --> 00:37:57.348]  Continue.
[00:37:57.348 --> 00:37:59.832]  Also, let's send them copies of Operation Northwood.
[00:37:59.832 --> 00:38:03.597]  Let's send them letters, articles, chapters from books.
[00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.172]  And let's just continue to get the word out.
[00:38:06.172 --> 00:38:08.174]  And you're right, Fox News went ballistic.
[00:38:08.174 --> 00:38:10.456]  I can't believe that they even let me on the air.
[00:38:10.456 --> 00:38:12.858]  One of their mockingbirds must have been asleep at the switch.
[00:38:12.858 --> 00:38:14.139]  Yeah, they took the bait big time.
[00:38:14.139 --> 00:38:21.586]  Well, no, they're going to try to say it's sedition and you're a traitor when they're the traitors that have hijacked this country, lied about WMDs, tried to get U.S.
[00:38:21.586 --> 00:38:24.608]  aircraft shot down, White House memo, high treason.
[00:38:24.608 --> 00:38:27.511]  You know, we've now got the guy that, you know, convicted
[00:38:28.932 --> 00:38:39.761]  Charlie Manson coming out and saying they wanted to stage terror attacks, and they got top prosecutors saying what we're saying now, and we've got governors saying it, German defense ministers, they're in trouble, they're the terrorists.
[00:38:39.761 --> 00:38:57.875]  A few minutes after the civic segment, they aired some hate mail guided towards me, and that's amazing because I've gotten some supporting letters from active Marines and from veterans, and as I said in the segment, I know Marines, I have friends that are Marines, active Marines that have served over there, corporals, lance corporals, and they are in the truth movement, they're involved in this,
[00:38:58.437 --> 00:39:02.041]  And they tell me that up to one-third of their friends in their units believe it.
[00:39:02.041 --> 00:39:04.263]  But again, it's so dangerous for them to speak out.
[00:39:04.263 --> 00:39:08.927]  Like I said in the segment, we're just trying to create a safe climate for them to facilitate a discussion.
[00:39:09.572 --> 00:39:14.576]  And really just stick it to the New World Order, knowing that the troops now know the truth.
[00:39:14.576 --> 00:39:21.341]  So let's kind of shift gears here a little bit instead of just street actions and handing out DVDs to ordinary crowds.
[00:39:21.341 --> 00:39:22.362]  Let's get organized here.
[00:39:22.362 --> 00:39:25.685]  Let's send them to the troops over there and really let's make our voices heard.
[00:39:25.685 --> 00:39:27.666]  There's another attack pattern in the Info War.
[00:39:27.666 --> 00:39:33.371]  You can also, if you live near bases, you can go into the bars they frequent and just say, hey, check this out, powerful info.
[00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:38.255]  That way, or if you're in the military, you can carry these in unmarked when you go back into country
[00:39:38.835 --> 00:39:41.438]  And just leave them around places.
[00:39:41.438 --> 00:39:43.720]  You want to be careful if you're going to be hanging out in bars.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:51.368]  Some of the Marines are a pretty rough crowd, and if you start addressing these issues, they could get quite angry or violent towards you.
[00:39:51.368 --> 00:39:53.009]  But maybe hit up Marine communities.
[00:39:53.009 --> 00:39:54.911]  That's not my experience.
[00:39:54.911 --> 00:39:58.235]  I've hit troops up in restaurants and in bars myself.
[00:39:59.161 --> 00:40:14.718]  Well it's amazing because I spent quite a few time, I have friends up in Oceanside which is the home of Camp Pendleton and I'll bring these issues up very lightly and it's incredible how many Marines will agree or at least suspect it and you know this phony that was on there trying to counter me, this head of this Veterans Association is saying that
[00:40:15.118 --> 00:40:19.621]  Everybody in the Marines knows, all the soldiers know their duty and they're ready to fight.
[00:40:19.621 --> 00:40:24.784]  Every Marine that I talk to is fed up and disgusted and they can't speak up about it otherwise they're going to get 9-11.
[00:40:24.784 --> 00:40:35.070]  Yeah, even if they don't think 9-11 is an inside job and haven't found out yet, they know they lied about WMDs, they know they lied about how long they'd be there, premeditatedly their own documents in the Pentagon saying they'll be there for 50 plus years.
[00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:38.452]  And so they've all heard about the other staged events.
[00:40:38.452 --> 00:40:42.674]  It's now come out in the Chicago Tribune, what we reported on in Terror Storm, that the U.S.
[00:40:42.674 --> 00:40:50.559]  government in Israel did premeditatedly attack the USS Liberty and order a stand-down of fighter protection to try to sink the ship to blame it on Egypt.
[00:40:50.559 --> 00:41:03.867]  And this traitor that's head of this Veterans Association obviously is not informing his people or anybody else about the Gulf of Konkin and USS Liberty and either he doesn't know anything about military history or he's just a typical shill and I think he's on the Fox News payroll.
[00:41:03.867 --> 00:41:04.507]  I've seen him on the
[00:41:04.955 --> 00:41:07.097]  On the network multiple times.
[00:41:07.097 --> 00:41:11.200]  Yeah, no, that's the group that puts out the propaganda TV ads.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:15.244]  Yeah, all the wars, all the troops support the war, everything's just great, yeah.
[00:41:15.244 --> 00:41:18.607]  Well, we do have organizations of Marines for 9-11 Truth.
[00:41:18.607 --> 00:41:22.810]  I've seen 9-11 Truth actions with a Marine in uniform out there.
[00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:28.435]  So, we have a lot of the military and, you know, like I said, like everybody knows, Ron Paul got the largest amount of donations
[00:41:28.789 --> 00:41:30.991]  From the troops, Ron Paul's against the war.
[00:41:30.991 --> 00:41:33.112]  What does that say about these individuals?
[00:41:33.112 --> 00:41:40.678]  For Fox News, leave it to all the networks of Fox News to try to attack us and try to attack this message and say that we're sending hate mail.
[00:41:40.678 --> 00:41:43.500]  I just learned of this during the last break.
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.561]  Only saw part of the clip.
[00:41:44.561 --> 00:41:46.082]  We're going to play the rest of it later.
[00:41:46.082 --> 00:41:48.764]  So everybody's learning about this as I learn about it as well.
[00:41:48.764 --> 00:41:50.545]  Were you able to get out MarkDice.com?
[00:41:51.562 --> 00:41:52.962]  I was, and it was extremely short.
[00:41:52.962 --> 00:41:54.083]  It was about five minutes.
[00:41:54.083 --> 00:41:59.665]  They cut me off twice, and I didn't even have a chance to get a lower third put on there with the website.
[00:41:59.665 --> 00:42:00.865]  That's why you've got to open.
[00:42:00.865 --> 00:42:01.705]  I'm not knocking you.
[00:42:01.705 --> 00:42:06.527]  You've got a degree in media, but the point is, I would have opened with markdice.com.
[00:42:06.527 --> 00:42:07.767]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:42:07.767 --> 00:42:14.109]  People are smart enough now, some of them, to just Google Mark Dice or The Resistance, and if you search for those terms, we're the first site to come up.
[00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:17.871]  I want to be clear here, Mark, and then I'm going to let you have your say.
[00:42:19.804 --> 00:42:21.065]  They're destroying our country.
[00:42:21.065 --> 00:42:22.245]  They're destroying our dollar.
[00:42:22.245 --> 00:42:23.766]  The North American Union's coming in.
[00:42:23.766 --> 00:42:25.047]  We are the patriots.
[00:42:25.047 --> 00:42:27.408]  We have a duty and a right to wake the troops up.
[00:42:27.408 --> 00:42:28.668]  It's our First Amendment.
[00:42:28.668 --> 00:42:32.410]  They encourage the public to send them stuff, and it's our right to do it.
[00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:36.792]  And I'm already seeing some blurbs about how, you know, you're a traitor, we're a traitor for doing this.
[00:42:36.792 --> 00:42:38.533]  What do you say to that?
[00:42:38.533 --> 00:42:41.995]  No, actually, we care about the troops probably more than some of these individuals.
[00:42:41.995 --> 00:42:46.817]  We're the ones that are reaching out and spending our time to get them some information, some valuable information.
[00:42:47.253 --> 00:42:54.741]  Many of the people in the truth movement spend their own time and money copying DVDs and handing out information, so we're the ones that actually care about their well-being.
[00:42:54.741 --> 00:43:03.650]  We're the ones that are trying to get them informed and trying to get them home, and trying to expose this mechanism that's caused them to get their lives put in danger in the first place.
[00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:08.736]  Well, that's why this info war attack pattern is so key, because it's headless.
[00:43:08.736 --> 00:43:09.877]  It's total lone wolf.
[00:43:10.644 --> 00:43:14.087]  And it's unstoppable if the listeners just put it into action.
[00:43:14.087 --> 00:43:20.853]  Flooding hundreds of thousands of DVDs and thumb drives and you can put Marshall Law, you know, all my films.
[00:43:20.853 --> 00:43:25.236]  You can go to PrisonPlanet.tv, download them in high quality, put them on thumb drives, put them on discs.
[00:43:25.236 --> 00:43:30.120]  You can put Order Out of Chaos, a book about government-sponsored terror by Paul Watson.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:35.505]  My book, Descent into Tyranny, on e-book on a tiny thumb drive and then send that into them.
[00:43:35.505 --> 00:43:36.766]  There is so much we can do here.
[00:43:37.734 --> 00:43:44.560]  Yeah, and you know, I meant to get out the questioning why they won't cover the Bilderberg Group and plug TerrorStorm and loose change Final Cut.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:51.187]  Things happen so fast, but again, leave it to Fox News to try to attack us and say that we're sending them hate mail.
[00:43:51.187 --> 00:43:52.348]  We're not sending them hate mail.
[00:43:52.348 --> 00:43:53.489]  These are heartfelt letters.
[00:43:54.048 --> 00:43:56.350]  Uh, and giving them valuable information that they need.
[00:43:56.350 --> 00:44:00.533]  And how many people actually will sit out and write the troops a letter other than their own family?
[00:44:00.533 --> 00:44:01.573]  Well, this is life and death.
[00:44:01.573 --> 00:44:03.815]  The New World Order is coming down on us.
[00:44:03.815 --> 00:44:04.796]  We don't have a choice.
[00:44:04.796 --> 00:44:05.796]  Our backs against the wall.
[00:44:05.796 --> 00:44:09.399]  We're defending ourselves peacefully with information.
[00:44:09.399 --> 00:44:12.521]  And, uh, again, we have got to do this.
[00:44:12.521 --> 00:44:15.063]  And this is a powerful idea.
[00:44:15.063 --> 00:44:15.463]  Mark Dice?
[00:44:16.721 --> 00:44:25.531]  Yeah, and I also want to encourage people to just email links from stories on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com into Fox News, and that's how they pick this up.
[00:44:25.531 --> 00:44:32.920]  Somebody goes through and reads all those emails at the shows that get emailed to Fox News and NewsTips at Fox News, whatever their email addresses are.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.924]  If you just send in the URL from a Prison Planet story sometime,
[00:44:36.331 --> 00:44:37.652]  They might actually pick that up.
[00:44:37.652 --> 00:44:41.816]  So, again, everybody, if you want to get involved, if you want to do this, you have to sign up.
[00:44:41.816 --> 00:44:45.899]  We're going to go through AdoptASoldier.org.
[00:44:45.899 --> 00:44:48.081]  You can go through my website to do that.
[00:44:48.081 --> 00:44:49.662]  You can do it largely through churches.
[00:44:49.662 --> 00:44:54.426]  They'll have organizations and soldiers' names and addresses, and we'll put you into contact with them.
[00:44:54.426 --> 00:44:57.990]  And, of course, we want to be nice, and we want to be caring.
[00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:01.833]  And, you know, they tried to say that, oh, we're sending them hate mail, and they're
[00:45:02.543 --> 00:45:05.025]  They're risking their lives for the pawns in the New World Order.
[00:45:05.025 --> 00:45:06.687]  We don't want them to be pawns in the New World Order.
[00:45:06.687 --> 00:45:07.808]  That's why we're doing this.
[00:45:07.808 --> 00:45:12.692]  And I just want to urge everybody, if you feel the need, to get out there and get on board.
[00:45:13.354 --> 00:45:17.399]  You've got your powerful press release at TheResistanceManifesto.com or MarkDice.com.
[00:45:17.399 --> 00:45:19.000]  It goes to the same place.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.704]  You've got a big banner at the top that everybody should put on their site.
[00:45:21.704 --> 00:45:23.906]  I want you for The Resistance.
[00:45:23.906 --> 00:45:31.034]  A great banner with Uncle Sam on it, with The Resistance on his hat, telling everybody this is a key thing to do.
[00:45:31.034 --> 00:45:32.416]  This is absolute genius.
[00:45:32.996 --> 00:45:37.500]  Uh, this is all of our minds working together, coming up with these type of ideas.
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:43.766]  And I'm just glad that you put Terror Storm and Loose Change Final Cut, both films that I'm involved in producing, uh, out to them.
[00:45:43.766 --> 00:45:46.649]  And, uh, Mark, I just absolutely commend you.
[00:45:46.649 --> 00:45:49.732]  They also hate it because I'm not knocking hippies or how hippies look.
[00:45:50.092 --> 00:45:54.214]  But, you know, you're a big six-foot-four, you know, big, you know, handsome, conservative-looking guy.
[00:45:54.214 --> 00:46:03.339]  You are conservative, a Christian churchgoer, and it just really upsets them, you know, to have that archetypal image of a, you know, healthy, good American up there.
[00:46:03.339 --> 00:46:05.660]  That even makes them more angry.
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:09.802]  Yeah, I didn't think, they probably suspected I wasn't going to be able to communicate the ideas.
[00:46:09.802 --> 00:46:13.324]  They would open the door, I'd open the door for attack for myself.
[00:46:13.324 --> 00:46:17.526]  You know, I had to get up at 4.30 in the morning to do this, and then the stupid producer calls me at 2.30 in the morning.
[00:46:18.433 --> 00:46:22.434]  And ask me if I got the confirmation and all this crap, so I really got no sleep.
[00:46:22.434 --> 00:46:36.638]  So, did the best I could and I got a run off to the day job because I myself am a slave to the New World Order, like many other people, so we just need to continue to get the information out and break free from the chains and from this disinformation that they're wrapping around our necks.
[00:46:36.638 --> 00:46:39.939]  Well, Mark, that's what people need to buy your book at markdice.com.
[00:46:39.939 --> 00:46:42.580]  I need to donate to you so you can go full-time in this.
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:43.440]  You're a great leader.
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:45.402]  And we need you full-time.
[00:46:45.402 --> 00:46:48.705]  I've told Luke Hradowski, people need to support him and we are changing.
[00:46:48.705 --> 00:46:52.189]  He can get out of college and really fight.
[00:46:52.189 --> 00:46:59.556]  We need people to go man the X-Wings here, not stay on their little home world, in the little backwaters.
[00:46:59.556 --> 00:47:00.818]  We need the leaders we've got.
[00:47:01.954 --> 00:47:12.558]  To go and join the rebellion against the New World Order right now, and Mark Dice, I just commend you for what you're doing for my family and everybody else's family, because they're going to stage more terror attacks.
[00:47:12.558 --> 00:47:20.600]  If we don't get on the news, if we don't expose that they did it, and this shakes them up, this spook that's on there, that you're fighting with, he looks very upset.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:25.102]  You know, you can tell they've lost the initiative, they've lost the high ground.
[00:47:25.542 --> 00:47:33.366]  Deep down, the New World Order minions know they're working for the terrorists and they're working with people to put out torture memos about torturing children.
[00:47:33.366 --> 00:47:34.246]  Game over, folks!
[00:47:34.246 --> 00:47:35.527]  We're not backing down!
[00:47:35.527 --> 00:47:36.808]  We're not playing games!
[00:47:36.808 --> 00:47:38.428]  We're defending the Republic!
[00:47:38.428 --> 00:47:40.229]  We're defending the United States!
[00:47:40.229 --> 00:47:42.690]  We are never backing down for this Republic!
[00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:44.151]  We are fighting the globalists!
[00:47:44.151 --> 00:47:49.354]  We are bullhorning them inside their meeting house just a few days ago, shutting down their internal meeting.
[00:47:49.354 --> 00:47:52.275]  I mean, Mark, the conference area of the hotel, the rest of the hotels, like,
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:57.423]  Two, three acres in, but the one part where they were meeting was only 20 yards off the road.
[00:47:57.423 --> 00:48:02.105]  We were able to bullhorn every day, hour after hour, shutting down their meetings.
[00:48:02.105 --> 00:48:05.668]  I'm told they had to move to another, more internal, smaller meeting room.
[00:48:05.668 --> 00:48:07.108]  I mean, this is shaking them up!
[00:48:07.108 --> 00:48:08.489]  We are hounding them!
[00:48:08.489 --> 00:48:09.590]  This is info war!
[00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:16.254]  We are shutting down the inside room, the smoky room, globalist, absolute, penultimate, top of the pyramid.
[00:48:16.254 --> 00:48:18.916]  We are engaging them everywhere you are engaging them.
[00:48:18.916 --> 00:48:21.097]  We are unleashing the people
[00:48:21.537 --> 00:48:22.657]  This is so exciting.
[00:48:22.657 --> 00:48:24.078]  MarkDice.com.
[00:48:24.078 --> 00:48:30.640]  Fire out the other website for the Veterans Group so people can go there and sign up to send people packages.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.882]  AdoptAUSoldier.org.
[00:48:33.882 --> 00:48:37.623]  That's AdoptAUSoldier.org.
[00:48:37.623 --> 00:48:39.284]  There's a link through my site.
[00:48:39.284 --> 00:48:40.064]  One more note here.
[00:48:40.064 --> 00:48:44.046]  The Resistance Manifesto will be sold out and out of print as of today.
[00:48:44.046 --> 00:48:50.528]  I have a revised edition with an extra 40 or 50 pages that is ready to be released here in a couple months.
[00:48:51.147 --> 00:48:53.208]  And it's the most powerful, up-to-date stuff.
[00:48:53.208 --> 00:48:58.010]  And I also have a new secret project that I've been working on that should also be released this summer.
[00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:59.591]  So keep your eyes open for that.
[00:48:59.591 --> 00:49:00.611]  I gotta run.
[00:49:00.611 --> 00:49:02.092]  Alex, you're an inspiration to us all.
[00:49:02.092 --> 00:49:03.193]  Keep up the good work.
[00:49:03.193 --> 00:49:04.753]  Mark Dice, over and out.
[00:49:04.753 --> 00:49:06.074]  All right, take care, Mark Dice.
[00:49:06.074 --> 00:49:07.995]  Going to work at the furniture store.
[00:49:07.995 --> 00:49:10.736]  Mark's also been audited and put through the ringer for what he's doing.
[00:49:11.679 --> 00:49:15.864]  We go through a lot, folks, to bring you this information, and I want you to support this man.
[00:49:15.864 --> 00:49:17.626]  He's a leader, not an infighter.
[00:49:17.626 --> 00:49:20.909]  He's somebody on the tip of the spear, and we need more Mark Dices.
[00:49:20.909 --> 00:49:29.959]  A lot of Mark Dices, a lot of Alex Joneses, a lot of DV Kids, a lot of Jack McClams, a lot of other Mark Kornkeys are listening right now!
[00:49:31.067 --> 00:49:38.312]  And those of you out there that follow Mark Corrington, other people like that, because I know some people that follow him have attacked me and wrongly, it's hurt my feelings.
[00:49:38.312 --> 00:49:39.973]  You need to understand Mark never end fights.
[00:49:39.973 --> 00:49:41.934]  Mark never does the things you are doing.
[00:49:41.934 --> 00:49:46.717]  I just noticed somebody attacking me, he's a fan of Mark, and you're not doing what Mark does, which doesn't make any sense.
[00:49:47.216 --> 00:49:48.397]  That's what you're supposedly doing.
[00:49:48.397 --> 00:49:51.659]  We need to be leaders here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:51.659 --> 00:49:53.600]  I am a platform for these people.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:50:01.785]  I watch somebody for a few years, if they don't backstab, if they don't attack, because the enemy always sets up for a year, gains credibility, then starts attacking everybody.
[00:50:01.785 --> 00:50:06.908]  But I watch people for a year or two, and sometimes I've been wrong and let them into my mix, tried to magnify them, tried to
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:12.081]  You know, hand my audience over to them to energize their operations, and I've been backstabbed.
[00:50:12.081 --> 00:50:18.243]  But that hasn't happened with some of the great folks I've been mentioning here, who I believe are worthy of your support.
[00:50:18.243 --> 00:50:21.624]  And I appreciate my listeners always supporting these individuals.
[00:50:21.624 --> 00:50:27.085]  Don't forget, I've been so busy the last few weeks, I've hardly been plugging my films, the books, the videos we sell.
[00:50:27.085 --> 00:50:28.846]  Remember, that's how we operate here.
[00:50:28.846 --> 00:50:30.546]  Thank you for the money bomb.
[00:50:30.546 --> 00:50:32.547]  We're trying to move, build a studio right now.
[00:50:33.471 --> 00:50:37.313]  Uh, that's going to take a month because I got to finish out and putting a wall into it and things.
[00:50:37.313 --> 00:50:38.494]  It's a little warehouse we got.
[00:50:38.494 --> 00:50:41.415]  Uh, it's just, we're just working our butts off.
[00:50:41.415 --> 00:50:45.918]  I went down to the Capitol to report on the burndown, uh, governor's mansion.
[00:50:45.918 --> 00:50:48.339]  I mean, we're just, we're working around the clock here for you.
[00:50:48.339 --> 00:50:49.080]  We need your prayers.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:49.700]  We need your support.
[00:50:54.434 --> 00:50:56.396]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:50:56.396 --> 00:51:00.020]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:02.483]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:51:02.483 --> 00:51:05.527]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:51:05.527 --> 00:51:11.253]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:51:11.253 --> 00:51:15.178]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:51:15.498 --> 00:51:20.680]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[00:51:52.588 --> 00:51:53.369]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:51:55.151 --> 00:51:57.373]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:51:57.373 --> 00:52:00.315]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:52:00.315 --> 00:52:08.923]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:52:08.923 --> 00:52:12.586]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:52:12.586 --> 00:52:17.129]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:52:17.129 --> 00:52:18.731]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:52:19.111 --> 00:52:20.151]  Take action now!
[00:52:20.151 --> 00:52:24.973]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:52:24.973 --> 00:52:28.954]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:52:28.954 --> 00:52:32.274]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:52:32.274 --> 00:52:38.716]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:52:39.016 --> 00:52:44.984]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:52:44.984 --> 00:52:47.307]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[00:52:47.307 --> 00:52:49.029]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:52:54.554 --> 00:52:57.136]  Do you stay up late worrying about your teen driver?
[00:52:57.136 --> 00:53:00.520]  Do you need to know the exact location of a loved one or a company vehicle?
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:04.503]  What can you do if your vehicle becomes one of the thousands annually targeted for theft?
[00:53:04.503 --> 00:53:11.470]  Now you can log into your own personal website and view the exact location of your vehicle, stationary or moving, in real time.
[00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:12.871]  24 hours a day.
[00:53:12.871 --> 00:53:20.818]  Introducing NowTrack, a revolutionary new GPS vehicle tracking device that requires no activation fee, no monthly fee, and no contract.

[00:53:31.627 --> 00:53:32.407]  We're good to go.
[00:54:16.184 --> 00:54:42.984]  The free world is being turned into the enslaved world.
[00:54:46.468 --> 00:54:49.229]  The New World Order is bringing darkness to the planet.
[00:54:49.229 --> 00:54:51.850]  We attempt to bring liberty.
[00:54:51.850 --> 00:54:57.112]  We attempt to bring freedom.
[00:54:57.112 --> 00:54:59.632]  Here's some of the news I've got in front of me.
[00:54:59.632 --> 00:55:03.514]  Bush prods allies for tougher stance on Iran.
[00:55:03.514 --> 00:55:05.254]  Fresh out of Bilderberg.
[00:55:05.254 --> 00:55:07.955]  Iran warns of painful response of Israel attacks.
[00:55:07.955 --> 00:55:11.236]  The media says, how dare them say they'll fight back?
[00:55:11.236 --> 00:55:12.977]  Media says they're not allowed to fight back if they're attacked.
[00:55:13.721 --> 00:55:16.003]  Secret Bilderberg agenda to microchip Americans.
[00:55:16.003 --> 00:55:19.506]  Elitists want to microchip Americans in the name of fighting terrorism.
[00:55:19.506 --> 00:55:21.587]  Europeans universally oppose attack on Iran.
[00:55:21.587 --> 00:55:24.049]  Globalist fear oil prices rising too quickly.
[00:55:24.049 --> 00:55:25.671]  It may alert the slaves.
[00:55:25.671 --> 00:55:27.052]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:27.052 --> 00:55:30.214]  Washington Post mentions Obama's handler is Bilderberg.
[00:55:30.214 --> 00:55:34.858]  They even admit what we reported two weeks ago, that he is handled by Bilderberg.
[00:55:34.858 --> 00:55:35.719]  Unbelievable!
[00:55:35.719 --> 00:55:39.582]  They'll never do a story on Bilderberg, just little blurbs about, yeah, we rule.
[00:55:39.582 --> 00:55:40.162]  Yeah, they rule.
[00:55:40.162 --> 00:55:40.763]  That was a headline.
[00:55:40.763 --> 00:55:41.143]  They rule.
[00:55:42.321 --> 00:55:45.663]  Barack Obama sets up internet war room to fight slurs.
[00:55:45.663 --> 00:55:46.904]  Good luck with that.
[00:55:46.904 --> 00:55:54.408]  Order of 9-11 calls, receives controversy, causes controversy.
[00:55:54.408 --> 00:55:58.931]  I was watching this man who the police admit called in the 9-1-1 report.
[00:55:58.931 --> 00:55:59.551]  We interviewed him.
[00:55:59.551 --> 00:56:01.872]  It's on YouTube.
[00:56:01.872 --> 00:56:02.993]  Alonzo Perez.
[00:56:02.993 --> 00:56:04.734]  He's, by the way, a listener of the show.
[00:56:04.734 --> 00:56:06.595]  We were down there at the governor's mansion yesterday.
[00:56:06.595 --> 00:56:08.296]  He was being interviewed by the media and the police.
[00:56:09.457 --> 00:56:25.287]  They admit in the news, he called in the 9-11 call, when the 9-1-1 call, when the governor's mansion was on fire, and it took more than 18 minutes, around 18 minutes for him to show up, I should say more than 15, after he called.
[00:56:25.287 --> 00:56:29.229]  And I was watching the news, a reporter interrogating him, going, were you drunk?
[00:56:29.229 --> 00:56:29.910]  Are you lying?
[00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:31.091]  Did you really call 9-1-1?
[00:56:31.091 --> 00:56:34.012]  And I was like, excuse me?
[00:56:34.012 --> 00:56:35.573]  The news admits he called 9-1-1.
[00:56:35.573 --> 00:56:37.835]  And the guy's like, I know, I'm just trying to find out.
[00:56:38.396 --> 00:56:43.341]  And the guy was trying to cover for DPS, trying to cover the Department of Public Safety, the State Police.
[00:56:43.341 --> 00:56:46.263]  It was really something else to watch it.
[00:56:46.263 --> 00:56:49.026]  And so now they call it a controversy.
[00:56:49.026 --> 00:56:50.047]  There's no controversy.
[00:56:50.047 --> 00:56:54.931]  It's admitted he called 9-1-1, and the State Police didn't.
[00:56:54.931 --> 00:56:59.155]  Officials received the first 9-1-1 call alerting them at the fire at the governor's mansion at 1-43 a.m.
[00:57:00.985 --> 00:57:05.868]  Sunday, Alonzo Perez made the call as he walked to his car from a night out on 6th Street.
[00:57:05.868 --> 00:57:08.470]  The Austin Fire Department confirms Perez made the first call.
[00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:09.671]  Fire Department, can they be trusted?
[00:57:09.671 --> 00:57:10.771]  Of course they can't.
[00:57:10.771 --> 00:57:17.215]  But the Texas Department of Public Safety, which cannot be trusted, which oversees security around the Capitol grounds, contends it made the first call.
[00:57:17.215 --> 00:57:25.100]  Perez's immediate response has caught controversy over the effectiveness of security that night, something that shocked Perez as he watched the mansion burn.
[00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:25.921]  And then they go on
[00:57:26.869 --> 00:57:29.732]  I didn't see nobody out there for 8 to 10 minutes.
[00:57:29.732 --> 00:57:30.452]  No, no, no, no.
[00:57:30.452 --> 00:57:31.593]  See, I watched the interview.
[00:57:31.593 --> 00:57:37.598]  We have the raw footage of News 8 interviewing him and of CBS interviewing him and others.
[00:57:37.598 --> 00:57:45.225]  He said 10 to 15 minutes after he called, they showed up.
[00:57:45.225 --> 00:57:48.227]  Okay.
[00:57:48.227 --> 00:57:54.533]  Then they, then I said, well, how long, you know, did you, how long did it take you to call once you saw the fire?
[00:57:55.293 --> 00:57:56.534]  And he said about 5 minutes.
[00:57:56.534 --> 00:57:58.935]  So you add 10 and 5, that's 15.
[00:57:58.935 --> 00:58:00.255]  And I said, how long would you say total?
[00:58:00.255 --> 00:58:03.136]  And he said, I don't know, 15 minutes, maybe longer.
[00:58:03.136 --> 00:58:04.637]  So they try to minimize that there.
[00:58:04.637 --> 00:58:06.998]  That was 8 to 10 minutes after he made the call.
[00:58:06.998 --> 00:58:13.721]  Fire investigators are interviewing Perez about what happened that night, hoping to piece together a more accurate timeline.
[00:58:13.721 --> 00:58:16.042]  To hear the 9-11 calls, click here.
[00:58:16.042 --> 00:58:17.243]  And we'll play that later.
[00:58:17.243 --> 00:58:17.963]  But we interviewed him.
[00:58:18.621 --> 00:58:18.981]  That's right.
[00:58:18.981 --> 00:58:21.182]  Fresh back from Bilderberg, we're out there getting the news for you.
[00:58:21.182 --> 00:58:24.863]  Aaron stayed up here late last night, getting it up on Infowars.com.
[00:58:24.863 --> 00:58:29.865]  Be sure you get that YouTube video out to everybody that's up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:58:29.865 --> 00:58:36.068]  The state police were garrisoned at the governor's mansion, but did nothing.
[00:58:36.068 --> 00:58:38.689]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:38.689 --> 00:58:44.931]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:44.931 --> 00:58:46.232]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:47.395 --> 00:58:49.156]  A New World Order.
[00:58:49.156 --> 00:58:53.659]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:58:53.659 --> 00:58:56.881]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:56.881 --> 00:58:59.662]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:59.662 --> 00:59:02.864]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:02.864 --> 00:59:10.189]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:13.206 --> 00:59:18.650]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:22.532]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:22.532 --> 00:59:25.094]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:25.094 --> 00:59:26.255]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:26.255 --> 00:59:27.035]  They're not after money.
[00:59:27.035 --> 00:59:28.316]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:28.316 --> 00:59:29.297]  They're after power.
[00:59:29.297 --> 00:59:30.458]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:59:39.183 --> 00:59:39.944]  In Game.
[00:59:39.944 --> 00:59:41.945]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:43.026]  You have been warned.
[00:59:46.928 --> 00:59:49.330]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:49.330 --> 00:59:58.175]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.175 --> 00:59:59.936]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:59.936 --> 01:00:01.517]  You want answers?
[01:00:01.517 --> 01:00:02.437]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:02.437 --> 01:00:07.260]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:11.323]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.562 --> 01:00:26.651]  Let it never be said in the Republic's darkest hour, as the country was sieved and used as an engine of worldwide domination by the globalists, that Americans, brave Americans and people worldwide didn't fight against the tyranny.
[01:00:26.651 --> 01:00:28.052]  We did and we are.
[01:00:28.052 --> 01:00:28.932]  Be part of history.
[01:00:28.932 --> 01:00:30.393]  Don't sit on the sidelines.
[01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:38.419]  The globalists want to wall off society into third world slavery as they go forward and enjoy all the new technologies and life extension for themselves.
[01:00:38.419 --> 01:00:40.840]  We salute Mark Dice.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:43.142]  Here is the Fox News propaganda piece in total.
[01:00:46.255 --> 01:00:47.576]  Well, moving on to other news.
[01:00:47.576 --> 01:00:51.118]  Imagine that you are a soldier stationed in Iraq.
[01:00:51.118 --> 01:00:54.179]  Mail call comes around and you've got a letter from back home.
[01:00:54.179 --> 01:00:56.560]  But it is not from your family or your friends.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:03.724]  It is a letter telling you that you are a pawn in the service of the, quote, New World Order.
[01:01:03.724 --> 01:01:08.306]  And that you are risking your life for a government that helped carry out the 9-11 attacks.
[01:01:09.927 --> 01:01:11.087]  This is not a joke.
[01:01:11.087 --> 01:01:13.668]  This is actually happening.
[01:01:13.668 --> 01:01:18.889]  These letters are the work of Mark Dice, the founder of a group called The Resistance.
[01:01:18.889 --> 01:01:22.950]  Mark joins us live now, along with Captain Pete Hegseth.
[01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:28.472]  Pete is a National Guardsman who served in Iraq, and he is the Executive Director of Vets for Freedom.
[01:01:28.472 --> 01:01:29.452]  Good morning, gentlemen.
[01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:30.933]  Good morning.
[01:01:30.933 --> 01:01:32.793]  Mark, let me start with you.
[01:01:32.793 --> 01:01:36.054]  Do you think this is helpful to our troops serving on the ground in Iraq?
[01:01:38.149 --> 01:01:44.171]  I think that it's very beneficial that we inform them as to the true circumstances that got them in the situation that they're in.
[01:01:44.171 --> 01:01:45.792]  How does it help the troops?
[01:01:45.792 --> 01:01:54.655]  I think that if they're able to make better decisions based on the facts, that they can decide to direct their lives and their careers and the positions and the direction that they want to go.
[01:01:54.655 --> 01:02:02.118]  I think feeding them a constant stream of propaganda is one of the most detrimental things to them and to our service.
[01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:03.139]  What do you want them to do?
[01:02:03.139 --> 01:02:04.199]  Abandon the war?
[01:02:04.199 --> 01:02:05.320]  To just walk off the battlefield?
[01:02:06.914 --> 01:02:08.896]  We want them to join the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:02:08.896 --> 01:02:14.840]  We want them to ask their superiors hard and compelling questions about the circumstances of 9-11.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:19.103]  Is that the role of an American soldier?
[01:02:19.103 --> 01:02:24.087]  Well, we want them to get the leadership to start thinking about what it is that they're sending these troops into.
[01:02:24.087 --> 01:02:30.712]  Look, everybody knows that the troops are so angry that they've been put in that position based on lies.
[01:02:30.712 --> 01:02:35.136]  Ron Paul had the largest donations from the troops themselves.
[01:02:35.576 --> 01:02:42.859]  The troops, you know, I personally know United States Marines, active Marines who've served in Iraq, who know that 9-11 is an inside job.
[01:02:42.859 --> 01:02:47.781]  We're trying to get the word out to as many people as possible and not keep them with the wool over their eyes.
[01:02:47.781 --> 01:02:52.803]  Pete, does Mark accurately characterize the attitude of the troops?
[01:02:52.803 --> 01:02:55.344]  I don't even want to dignify this with a response, really.
[01:02:55.344 --> 01:03:00.306]  I mean, he knows a couple of Marines, so therefore he knows how the veterans feel and the troops feel about this conflict.
[01:03:00.566 --> 01:03:02.488]  You know, our troops are just a little bit busy over there.
[01:03:02.488 --> 01:03:07.551]  I don't think they're going to want to take the time to open mail from some fringe political sect.
[01:03:07.551 --> 01:03:09.193]  They're too busy winning this war in Iraq.
[01:03:09.193 --> 01:03:14.537]  They're too busy decimating Al-Qaeda and standing up an Iraqi government that can take the fight to our enemies.
[01:03:14.537 --> 01:03:19.020]  They're not worried about... I have a feeling these letters are going to find their way into the latrine and elsewhere.
[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:23.344]  They're just not really going to care what some group in Southern California thinks about their service.
[01:03:23.344 --> 01:03:24.304]  They know what they're doing.
[01:03:24.304 --> 01:03:25.225]  They believe in it.
[01:03:25.225 --> 01:03:26.426]  They're succeeding.
[01:03:26.426 --> 01:03:28.768]  And frankly, for him to say he's talked to a couple Marines
[01:03:29.969 --> 01:03:35.252]  People will think a lot of different things, but we represent 24,000 vets at Vets for Freedom.
[01:03:35.252 --> 01:03:36.893]  We believe in finishing this mission.
[01:03:36.893 --> 01:03:40.155]  We believe in what we're doing, and that's how most veterans and troops on the ground feel.
[01:03:40.155 --> 01:03:51.523]  Mark, given that you say you care about the troops, you say you support them, given what you've just heard Pete say, how can you justify having 3,000 people send what some would argue amounts to hate mail to them?
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:54.721]  Okay, we're informing them.
[01:03:54.721 --> 01:04:00.464]  We're going to be sending them DVDs, declassified documents of Operation Northwoods, where our government planned terrorist attacks.
[01:04:00.464 --> 01:04:03.225]  What makes you think they want that, Mark?
[01:04:03.225 --> 01:04:06.067]  What makes you think they want a constant stream of propaganda?
[01:04:06.067 --> 01:04:07.808]  Why wouldn't somebody want the truth?
[01:04:07.808 --> 01:04:09.569]  People want the facts, okay?
[01:04:09.569 --> 01:04:11.710]  The Marines are hungry for the truth.
[01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:12.910]  What got them there?
[01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:14.111]  Why are they there?
[01:04:14.111 --> 01:04:16.112]  Why are they risking their lives?
[01:04:16.112 --> 01:04:17.553]  And we're going to help them understand that.
[01:04:17.553 --> 01:04:19.154]  So because you talked to a couple of Marines?
[01:04:19.594 --> 01:04:19.914]  Total Bull!
[01:04:19.914 --> 01:04:20.975]  Iran is not Al-Qaeda.
[01:04:20.975 --> 01:04:23.756]  Al-Qaeda is run by the criminals that run our government, that have hijacked it.
[01:04:23.756 --> 01:04:24.856]  We have not even begun to fight.
[01:04:24.856 --> 01:04:26.117]  We have not even begun to fight.
[01:04:26.117 --> 01:04:28.658]  Nothing can stop, no army can stop an idea whose time has come, traitors.
[01:04:51.164 --> 01:04:55.686]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:04:55.686 --> 01:05:00.768]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:05:00.768 --> 01:05:02.289]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:02.289 --> 01:05:05.890]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:05:59.454 --> 01:06:00.935]  The late great USA.
[01:06:00.935 --> 01:06:02.716]  America, freedom to fascism.

[01:06:52.691 --> 01:06:53.971]  Let's get real.
[01:06:53.971 --> 01:06:55.691]  Flour is already being rationed.
[01:06:55.691 --> 01:07:00.892]  Prices on food are getting so high, warehouses are installing security systems and guards.
[01:07:00.892 --> 01:07:04.793]  You can expect soon to see criminal activity in food.
[01:07:04.793 --> 01:07:12.755]  We're all in a foot race as to whether the food will become so expensive we can't afford it, or there will be no food at any price.
[01:07:12.755 --> 01:07:16.756]  We can't grow enough of our own food, even with genetically altered trash.
[01:07:16.756 --> 01:07:19.717]  It will give you the opportunity to eat perfectly engineered food.
[01:07:20.842 --> 01:07:25.044]  They think God didn't get it right, so Monsanto had to step in.
[01:07:25.044 --> 01:07:28.906]  If you think it's a little bit crazy to put in a supply of food, it's okay.
[01:07:28.906 --> 01:07:30.127]  We won't tell.
[01:07:30.127 --> 01:07:30.487]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:07:30.487 --> 01:07:31.348]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:31.348 --> 01:07:31.588]  That's 800-409-5633.
[01:07:31.588 --> 01:07:32.848]  It may be a little bit crazy.
[01:07:32.848 --> 01:07:33.849]  That's okay.
[01:07:33.849 --> 01:07:37.051]  Because there is no such thing as a little bit dead.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:58.463]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:58.463 --> 01:08:05.085]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:05.085 --> 01:08:13.409]  I'm going to move Bob Chapman to tomorrow, because we're going to cover economics right now with Dr. Jerome Corsi, because we have breaking news coming up in the next hour.
[01:08:13.409 --> 01:08:15.550]  We went down to the governor's mansion yesterday.
[01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:17.631]  We put out the call to our huge audience.
[01:08:17.631 --> 01:08:20.892]  I would say two out of four or five
[01:08:22.088 --> 01:08:27.290]  Listeners here in Austin, I would say two out of four or five people in Austin are big listeners and support us.
[01:08:27.290 --> 01:08:29.971]  So we have incredible coverage here over the years.
[01:08:29.971 --> 01:08:34.832]  We have an inside source dealing with the governor's mansion coming up in one hour.
[01:08:34.832 --> 01:08:38.533]  We also went down there and interviewed the first person to call in the fire.
[01:08:38.533 --> 01:08:41.854]  Even the mainstream media is saying there's some type of cover-up going on.
[01:08:41.854 --> 01:08:43.055]  That is coming up.
[01:08:43.055 --> 01:08:46.496]  We know they burned down the Capitol, burned part of it to rebuild it.
[01:08:46.496 --> 01:08:49.237]  That's mainstream knowledge in Austin back in the 80s.
[01:08:50.865 --> 01:08:53.246]  And the state is incredibly corrupt.
[01:08:53.246 --> 01:08:55.026]  There was a stand down by the state police.
[01:08:55.026 --> 01:08:56.587]  That is coming up.
[01:08:56.587 --> 01:08:58.387]  We'll be breaking that down.
[01:08:58.387 --> 01:09:04.049]  Right now we go to Dr. Jerome Corsi, doctorate in economics, best-selling author.
[01:09:04.049 --> 01:09:09.350]  And we're going to, for the rest of the hour, talk about what's happening with oil, the economy, where he sees things going.
[01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:11.331]  Dr. Corsi, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:09:11.331 --> 01:09:12.571]  Alex, always a great pleasure.
[01:09:13.124 --> 01:09:15.586]  My PhD, by the way, is political science from Harvard.
[01:09:15.586 --> 01:09:17.187]  That's right, political science from Harvard.
[01:09:17.187 --> 01:09:18.948]  But I knew you worked in economics then.
[01:09:18.948 --> 01:09:23.410]  Oh, I have worked in banking and finance for 25 years.
[01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:26.232]  So I have had a lot of experience in international banking.
[01:09:26.232 --> 01:09:31.475]  I know your info meshes with the Nobel Prize winners and others we've had on what's happening.
[01:09:31.475 --> 01:09:36.398]  I cover economics, I cover oil, World Net Daily, where I'm a staff reporter, I cover it every day.
[01:09:37.111 --> 01:09:43.254]  Okay, first off, I was on Coast to Coast AM last night right after you were on talking about threats to my family.
[01:09:43.254 --> 01:09:47.517]  There's new ones, ladies and gentlemen, not just the stuff that happened Sunday afternoon.
[01:09:47.517 --> 01:10:00.244]  I want to get your take on these global elitist meeting and what you think about the info that we've gotten from inside their meeting about the attack on Iran, about how they want to get the population microchipped.
[01:10:00.764 --> 01:10:04.746]  How some of them now think they've raised oil prices too much that it may kill the golden goose.
[01:10:04.746 --> 01:10:07.227]  The majority of them still wanting to raise oil prices.
[01:10:07.227 --> 01:10:09.048]  Do you have any take on the Bilderberg Group?
[01:10:09.048 --> 01:10:12.370]  Well, I'm going to pick up on a story on this.
[01:10:12.370 --> 01:10:27.457]  The Federal Reserve banker, this guy Timothy Geithner, G-E-I-T-H-N-E-R, who just wrote in the Financial Times, I guess he came out of the Bilderberg meeting, and he's now writing that there's need for greater global
[01:10:28.163 --> 01:10:31.626]  Central bank regulation over banking worldwide.
[01:10:31.626 --> 01:10:33.888]  So they create the crisis, offer the solution.
[01:10:33.888 --> 01:10:35.289]  He's the president, not the chairman.
[01:10:35.289 --> 01:10:37.811]  Bernanke was also there, of the Federal Reserve.
[01:10:37.811 --> 01:10:39.132]  He comes out one day after.
[01:10:39.132 --> 01:10:43.416]  We reported Saturday on a Genesis Show that they wanted centralized banking globally.
[01:10:43.416 --> 01:10:45.938]  Exactly what we said, then happened a day later.
[01:10:45.938 --> 01:10:50.622]  Right, he came to the, this is at the Economic Club of New York, he gave a speech.
[01:10:50.622 --> 01:10:54.305]  And they excerpted it, published it in the Financial Times, I guess on Monday.
[01:10:55.426 --> 01:11:10.049]  And the speech calls directly for greater global controls, talking about Bank of International Settlements and the other central banks need to have even a higher level of global control.
[01:11:10.049 --> 01:11:12.349]  And of course, it's right out of the crisis.
[01:11:12.349 --> 01:11:14.590]  The financial system has been in crisis.
[01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:24.812]  We've seen the meltdown of the mortgage market in the United States, where I'm concerned there could be a meltdown of these derivatives that are held in the Bank of International Settlements.
[01:11:25.362 --> 01:11:31.364]  Of which there's almost 600 trillion dollars of derivatives that people understand very little about.
[01:11:31.364 --> 01:11:35.366]  And they are another bubble that's waiting to burst.
[01:11:35.366 --> 01:11:52.272]  But it's alarming that here Gethnier is coming out of the meeting, of the Bilderberger meeting, and as you say, this credit crisis, the solution being proposed, is to go to another level of global control, even on top of the central banks.
[01:11:52.272 --> 01:11:54.193]  So they are using the crisis as a
[01:11:55.103 --> 01:11:59.205]  Push towards banking globalism.
[01:11:59.205 --> 01:12:00.406]  Go down about it.
[01:12:00.406 --> 01:12:02.267]  Well, just as we said months ago, they would do.
[01:12:02.267 --> 01:12:03.208]  The central banks.
[01:12:03.208 --> 01:12:04.389]  I've been arguing about it.
[01:12:04.389 --> 01:12:15.775]  I wrote in the late great USA that we would see the demise of the dollar that would occur as a pressure towards the regional currency, the Amaro.
[01:12:15.775 --> 01:12:18.617]  The dollar is at its lowest point ever.
[01:12:18.617 --> 01:12:21.899]  I mean, it's been trading again down about a dollar.
[01:12:22.786 --> 01:12:24.607]  $1.57, $1.58 to the Euro.
[01:12:24.607 --> 01:12:27.669]  I'll check if it's worth that right now while we're talking.
[01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:30.290]  But that's about a historical low point against the Euro.
[01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:37.394]  And it came up a little bit today, $1.54, but yesterday it was $1.57.
[01:12:37.394 --> 01:12:45.838]  And the low point of the dollar is also one of the reasons why oil has been trading at $138 or $139 a barrel.
[01:12:49.232 --> 01:12:54.136]  Because the commodities have been directly impacted upwards.
[01:12:54.136 --> 01:13:01.702]  Even though the central banks are trying to continue to depress the price of gold, gold last week started trading above $900 an ounce again.
[01:13:01.702 --> 01:13:05.164]  I see today they're trying to depress it again at about $872 an ounce.
[01:13:05.164 --> 01:13:18.535]  But I think the long-term pressures here are going to be that oil's going to be, I'm saying now, going up to... I wrote an article today in WorldNetDaily, I'm quoting some of the very
[01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:33.041]  On top, you know, this is Goldman Sachs saying, Goldman Sachs' top analyst, Arjun Murthy, saying $200 a barrel and $5.75 a gallon.
[01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:39.387]  Now, this guy Murthy, who's a 39-year-old, is one of the top energy analysts at Goldman Sachs.
[01:13:39.387 --> 01:13:43.950]  He's been driving the markets because he's been predicting higher oil prices.
[01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:45.972]  Now, there's another pressure I don't see stopping.
[01:13:47.047 --> 01:14:08.953]  If Murti is saying, in Goldman Sachs, $200 a barrel for oil, likely over the next 6 to 24 months, so it could happen within the next 6 months, and Murti is saying he's not a peak oil theorist, he does not believe that the oil is running out, he's not one of those guys that thinks we're running out of oil worldwide.
[01:14:08.953 --> 01:14:11.193]  Yeah, total artificial scarcity scam.
[01:14:11.193 --> 01:14:11.874]  That's what it is.
[01:14:11.874 --> 01:14:13.014]  He's written a book on the subject.
[01:14:13.436 --> 01:14:19.199]  And he is, well, I wrote Black Gold Stranglehold, and I've argued that this was the kind of manipulation that you get in these markets.
[01:14:19.199 --> 01:14:20.639]  Yeah, I want to stop you, Dr. Corsi.
[01:14:20.639 --> 01:14:21.420]  That's the key.
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:25.081]  We have people on this show whose predictions all come true.
[01:14:25.081 --> 01:14:27.842]  We bring you Ron Paul, Dr. Corsi.
[01:14:27.842 --> 01:14:32.584]  We bring you Dr. Joseph Stiklitz, former Chief Economist, World Bank, and a Nobel Prize winner.
[01:14:32.584 --> 01:14:34.685]  We bring you the head of the New York Business School.
[01:14:34.685 --> 01:14:37.627]  We bring you people whose predictions all come true.
[01:14:37.627 --> 01:14:38.887]  I wish you were wrong, Doctor.
[01:14:38.887 --> 01:14:40.528]  Talk about the ramifications
[01:14:41.688 --> 01:14:45.470]  $5.75 a gallon of gasoline.
[01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:47.071]  What will that do in the ripple effect?
[01:14:47.071 --> 01:14:49.413]  There's a lot of people I hear say, well, I'm a hippie.
[01:14:49.413 --> 01:14:50.533]  I only ride a bicycle.
[01:14:50.533 --> 01:14:53.275]  They don't understand that will affect everybody.
[01:14:53.275 --> 01:14:54.635]  It'll be a huge effect.
[01:14:54.635 --> 01:14:59.778]  This is like a change in phenomenon.
[01:14:59.778 --> 01:15:01.379]  It's like a whole new world.
[01:15:01.379 --> 01:15:08.603]  I mean, at $5.75 a gallon, even today at over $4 a gallon, food is delivered by trucks.
[01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:14.219]  Energy prices impact almost everything we eat or consume or buy.
[01:15:14.219 --> 01:15:16.480]  Air conditioning?
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:21.641]  The travel industry, air conditioning, all the quality of life issues.
[01:15:21.641 --> 01:15:23.581]  Refrigeration, all energy.
[01:15:23.581 --> 01:15:25.101]  All that are energy driven.
[01:15:25.101 --> 01:15:29.502]  And it really isn't based on dollar devaluation, isn't that the largest reason?
[01:15:29.502 --> 01:15:32.523]  The dollar devaluation is the major change in the market.
[01:15:32.523 --> 01:15:34.843]  I mean, if you look back a year to 18 months, we had oil at $57 a barrel.
[01:15:38.464 --> 01:15:40.225]  Today it's double that easily.
[01:15:40.225 --> 01:15:42.467]  It's now at $138.39 a barrel.
[01:15:42.467 --> 01:15:47.270]  Today it's trading at $134.50 a barrel.
[01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:52.974]  These are prices that are way in excess of the amount that demand has increased in that period of time.
[01:15:52.974 --> 01:15:55.216]  And we have all the big SUV plants.
[01:15:55.216 --> 01:15:57.998]  All the big SUV plants are announcing shutdown.
[01:15:57.998 --> 01:16:07.505]  Well, it changes everybody's style of life because immediately their families have to make decisions now between filling up their gas tanks and buying groceries for the family.
[01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:13.899]  There are families that are not going to be able to live any kind of a middle-class lifestyle.
[01:16:13.899 --> 01:16:17.041]  Air conditioning is going to be heating when we get into the winter.
[01:16:17.041 --> 01:16:19.623]  It's going to become problematic.
[01:16:19.623 --> 01:16:20.784]  Traveling anywhere.
[01:16:20.784 --> 01:16:27.690]  The air travel industry, the airlines are virtually in crisis.
[01:16:27.690 --> 01:16:31.513]  They don't know how to survive at these kinds of prices.
[01:16:31.513 --> 01:16:34.636]  They're all consolidating or reducing staff.
[01:16:34.636 --> 01:16:37.158]  They can't increase tickets, but they start increasing tickets.
[01:16:37.802 --> 01:16:43.683]  To cover oil at $135 a barrel, no one will be able to fly.
[01:16:43.683 --> 01:16:46.104]  Well, Dr. Corsi, let me just give you some on-the-ground stuff.
[01:16:46.104 --> 01:16:48.964]  I flew southwest to Virginia to cover D.C.
[01:16:48.964 --> 01:16:54.726]  and back, and both the flight there and back were delayed over an hour and a half.
[01:16:54.726 --> 01:16:56.526]  Most of the other flights were delayed.
[01:16:56.526 --> 01:17:01.287]  I've never seen it unless it's bad weather, and it wasn't delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed on the boards.
[01:17:01.992 --> 01:17:05.893]  Uh, the Southwest woman, we were, everybody was just talking, uh, waiting for the plane to come.
[01:17:05.893 --> 01:17:09.913]  She started screaming at us saying, shut up, shut up, I want to talk to you.
[01:17:09.913 --> 01:17:14.254]  She ordered everybody to stand up an hour early to get up before the plane even arrived.
[01:17:14.254 --> 01:17:16.935]  When people didn't do it, she screamed at everybody and told them to do it.
[01:17:16.935 --> 01:17:19.635]  Uh, I noticed they were screaming at people at other things.
[01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:22.576]  The toilet was stinking and overflowing in the plane.
[01:17:22.576 --> 01:17:25.736]  Uh, the stewardesses were griping at everybody.
[01:17:25.736 --> 01:17:29.177]  I mean, I was seeing palpable panic by the airport personnel.
[01:17:29.867 --> 01:17:39.350]  Well, this is a crisis, and you're going to see it reflected in airline employees, because staffs are being cut across the board.
[01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:42.670]  People are being asked to do jobs that are two or three times more difficult.
[01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:45.611]  They're not even pumping the toilets out once a day.
[01:17:45.611 --> 01:17:46.571]  I don't surprise it.
[01:17:46.571 --> 01:17:48.992]  It wouldn't surprise me at all.
[01:17:48.992 --> 01:17:51.513]  Flying today is going to become very problematic.
[01:17:51.513 --> 01:17:54.614]  They're going to cancel flights if they don't have them full.
[01:17:54.614 --> 01:17:57.394]  There's going to be a lot of problems with scheduling.
[01:17:57.394 --> 01:17:59.615]  There's going to be difficulties in terms of pricing.
[01:18:00.196 --> 01:18:02.037]  You're going to be lucky to get any service at all.
[01:18:02.037 --> 01:18:05.779]  Today is a fly-if-you-have-to environment.
[01:18:05.779 --> 01:18:06.659]  It's going to get worse.
[01:18:06.659 --> 01:18:07.419]  And I had to fly.
[01:18:07.419 --> 01:18:11.301]  I mean, it was a wreaking sewage plant that I was flying on.
[01:18:11.301 --> 01:18:13.402]  Well, that's going to become more common.
[01:18:13.402 --> 01:18:17.804]  And I'm concerned about safety problems in terms of airplane maintenance.
[01:18:17.804 --> 01:18:19.685]  That's the next thing that's going to become a problem.
[01:18:19.685 --> 01:18:25.347]  Oh, they admit it's come out that a bunch of companies are getting in major trouble because the maintenance just isn't being done.
[01:18:25.347 --> 01:18:28.729]  Well, and by, you know, what's happened to me is when I look at, I predicted, I wrote,
[01:18:29.963 --> 01:18:31.864]  Black Gold Stranglehold with Craig Smith.
[01:18:31.864 --> 01:18:34.024]  We published that in 2005.
[01:18:34.024 --> 01:18:34.765]  We published that.
[01:18:34.765 --> 01:18:37.366]  We said oil was going to be at $100 a barrel.
[01:18:37.366 --> 01:18:39.266]  And everybody said we were nuts.
[01:18:39.266 --> 01:18:41.707]  Well, today oil is at $135 a barrel.
[01:18:41.707 --> 01:18:46.209]  We've got Goldman Sachs saying it's going to go as high as $200 a barrel.
[01:18:46.209 --> 01:18:50.010]  And I'm saying, I'm looking at $145 to $150 a barrel being right around the corner.
[01:18:50.010 --> 01:18:51.350]  The pressures on this are largely speculation.
[01:18:59.707 --> 01:19:05.670]  There's a big drop in the value of the dollar, so people want to have more hard currency.
[01:19:05.670 --> 01:19:08.331]  They're dumping out into real assets.
[01:19:08.331 --> 01:19:09.012]  Right, exactly.
[01:19:09.012 --> 01:19:10.893]  So oil's a hard asset.
[01:19:10.893 --> 01:19:12.233]  It's a commodity.
[01:19:12.233 --> 01:19:17.216]  And to sell the oil, they want $135 of these worthless dollars.
[01:19:17.216 --> 01:19:20.577]  And also, you've got the speculators taking advantage of that.
[01:19:20.577 --> 01:19:21.958]  And it's getting priced into it.
[01:19:21.958 --> 01:19:26.080]  I'm increasingly convinced that they're pricing into it a war in the Middle East.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.621]  I think they're pricing into it a war.
[01:19:30.258 --> 01:19:34.100]  I want to hear about that when we get back, what you think is going on with Iran.
[01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:38.903]  Then I want to get into how NPR and others have bragged that the Bilderberg Group wanted to get $200 a barrel oil.
[01:19:38.903 --> 01:19:42.705]  They bragged they were going to do this quote to teach us not to consume so much.
[01:19:42.705 --> 01:19:46.427]  This is the new environmentalism you're seeing artificially creating scarcity.
[01:19:47.185 --> 01:19:48.427]  You want to be third-world slaves?
[01:19:48.427 --> 01:19:48.867]  You are.
[01:19:48.867 --> 01:19:51.130]  That goes for all of you that serve the system.
[01:19:51.130 --> 01:20:03.805]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:20:04.265 --> 01:20:15.333]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:20:15.333 --> 01:20:18.735]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:20:18.735 --> 01:20:20.516]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:20:20.516 --> 01:20:26.640]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:33.765]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com while you're visiting the online video store.
[01:20:34.105 --> 01:20:42.274]  Be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[01:20:42.274 --> 01:20:44.917]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[01:20:44.917 --> 01:20:50.223]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:20:51.075 --> 01:20:55.199]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:20:55.199 --> 01:21:07.892]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:21:07.892 --> 01:21:08.352]  The U.S.
[01:21:08.352 --> 01:21:13.878]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:21:14.298 --> 01:21:17.281]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:21:17.281 --> 01:21:19.483]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:21:19.483 --> 01:21:22.446]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:21:22.446 --> 01:21:28.912]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:21:28.912 --> 01:21:32.335]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:21:32.335 --> 01:21:38.681]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:21:39.221 --> 01:21:43.351]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:21:43.351 --> 01:21:43.571]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:43.571 --> 01:21:43.772]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:51.533 --> 01:21:55.296]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:21:55.296 --> 01:22:00.321]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:22:00.321 --> 01:22:05.806]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:22:05.806 --> 01:22:16.296]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:22:16.776 --> 01:22:21.178]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:22:21.178 --> 01:22:23.959]  They oppose everything that is God and Truth.
[01:22:23.959 --> 01:22:27.521]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:22:27.521 --> 01:22:40.026]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[01:22:40.506 --> 01:22:44.230]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.
[01:22:44.230 --> 01:22:48.555]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them dot com.
[01:22:48.555 --> 01:22:49.797]  The message of His Kingdom.
[01:22:50.936 --> 01:23:01.682]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy, and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet, but it just seemed so difficult.
[01:23:01.682 --> 01:23:11.507]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[01:23:11.507 --> 01:23:12.268]  Drinking water?
[01:23:12.788 --> 01:23:14.449]  Now that's something I can handle.
[01:23:14.449 --> 01:23:20.133]  The guys at Snyder Health took the time to explain all of the different options and help me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[01:23:20.133 --> 01:23:22.535]  I use my new Jupiter ionizer for everything.
[01:23:22.535 --> 01:23:32.241]  For drinking, for cooking, and since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost 7 pounds, and my skin looks great!
[01:23:32.241 --> 01:23:34.863]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.
[01:23:39.246 --> 01:23:44.110]  They offer a full 30-day money-back guarantee and free shipping, so there's absolutely no risk.
[01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:46.952]  You can visit them on the web at SnyderHealth.com.
[01:23:46.952 --> 01:24:02.085]  That's S-N-Y-D-E-R-Health.com.
[01:24:02.085 --> 01:24:05.488]  Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
[01:24:06.828 --> 01:24:12.811]  Dotton's room, of course, he's our guest.
[01:24:12.811 --> 01:24:22.074]  This is the beginning of the dollar implosion.
[01:24:36.647 --> 01:24:37.828]  The world doesn't want them.
[01:24:37.828 --> 01:24:43.430]  Here, domestically, they still have some value, but overnight, that could erode.
[01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:46.491]  It's slow erosion is now accelerating.
[01:24:46.491 --> 01:24:47.232]  All by design.
[01:24:47.232 --> 01:24:54.395]  We told you two years ago, Bilderberg 2006, with our spies inside, and some of their minions, people that work for them.
[01:24:54.395 --> 01:24:56.215]  We have multiple sources.
[01:24:56.215 --> 01:24:58.877]  At great danger to themselves.
[01:24:58.877 --> 01:25:03.318]  I mean, Tucker, to meet with them, he'll have to change cars, go through shopping malls, get with other people.
[01:25:03.318 --> 01:25:04.459]  We've got video of that.
[01:25:05.157 --> 01:25:13.328]  We've got sources that they plan to have it at $200 a barrel within three years, but they plan to have it at $240 a barrel by the summer.
[01:25:13.328 --> 01:25:14.770]  That's in my film, Endgame.
[01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:16.732]  It's been out for nine months.
[01:25:16.732 --> 01:25:20.397]  Footage we shot two years ago.
[01:25:20.397 --> 01:25:21.399]  They run things, folks.
[01:25:21.399 --> 01:25:22.380]  What they say they get.
[01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:24.571]  They artificially want to squeeze us.
[01:25:24.571 --> 01:25:31.977]  They artificially want to have you so poor, you can't take care of yourself or defend yourself when they CPS your children or send you to prison for no reason.
[01:25:31.977 --> 01:25:36.941]  They're hiring more and more cops on a broke-back economy, outriding tickets.
[01:25:36.941 --> 01:25:38.162]  I was just talking to Weldon Henson.
[01:25:38.162 --> 01:25:41.245]  I went to visit some of his military buddies in Florida this weekend.
[01:25:42.017 --> 01:25:47.841]  He said Southwest, they were screaming at him in the terminals, searching old men, screaming at people on the plane.
[01:25:47.841 --> 01:25:48.541]  See, the same thing.
[01:25:48.541 --> 01:25:53.144]  It's unraveling as the dollar implodes, as they slash staff.
[01:25:53.144 --> 01:25:54.425]  You're going to see this everywhere.
[01:25:54.425 --> 01:25:56.126]  Dr. Corsi.
[01:25:56.126 --> 01:25:57.887]  Well, that's exactly right, Alex.
[01:25:57.887 --> 01:26:02.070]  You've got... The dollar crisis is not going to end anytime soon.
[01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:06.633]  I mean, the dollar has been in crisis now for two years, and it's worsening.
[01:26:06.633 --> 01:26:08.634]  It's at the lowest point ever against the euro.
[01:26:09.521 --> 01:26:16.384]  The dollar, in terms of commodities, is one of the major reasons why oil has gone up so much in price.
[01:26:16.384 --> 01:26:19.085]  And the media will never say the main reason.
[01:26:19.085 --> 01:26:20.105]  No one talks about it.
[01:26:20.105 --> 01:26:20.866]  It's the dollar.
[01:26:20.866 --> 01:26:22.166]  It's a big secret.
[01:26:22.166 --> 01:26:24.927]  I can't figure out why, because it's obvious.
[01:26:24.927 --> 01:26:27.949]  Demand has not gone up this dramatically.
[01:26:27.949 --> 01:26:30.570]  Yes, China's coming online and needing more energy.
[01:26:30.570 --> 01:26:32.410]  India's needing more energy.
[01:26:32.410 --> 01:26:34.491]  We've known this for ten years.
[01:26:34.491 --> 01:26:36.272]  And there's still ample supply.
[01:26:36.272 --> 01:26:38.793]  I mean, the supply has not been disrupted.
[01:26:39.518 --> 01:26:44.340]  The major oil companies, the international companies, have all the oil reserves they could possibly need.
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:47.402]  They're just training us for the new way of life.
[01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:52.764]  Well, and with the manipulation of the price of oil right now, which is clearly manipulation.
[01:26:52.764 --> 01:26:57.486]  It's caused by the dollar being weaker and the increased speculation.
[01:26:57.486 --> 01:27:02.408]  And I'm confident it's pricing into a concern about a war with Iran.
[01:27:02.408 --> 01:27:04.989]  I think the rhetoric on Iran is ramping up again.
[01:27:04.989 --> 01:27:08.851]  And I'm pretty determined the Bush administration is going to take a hard look
[01:27:09.531 --> 01:27:14.673]  At a war with Iran before, even possibly before the election.
[01:27:14.673 --> 01:27:16.774]  Certainly before the end of the Bush administration.
[01:27:16.774 --> 01:27:19.315]  Well let me give you the inside scoop.
[01:27:19.315 --> 01:27:21.516]  Double confirmed, actually triple confirmed.
[01:27:21.516 --> 01:27:26.518]  Secretary of Defense Gates was there for multiple days at Bilderberg in Chantilly, Virginia.
[01:27:26.518 --> 01:27:27.958]  The Westfields Marriott.
[01:27:27.958 --> 01:27:30.319]  And he said that we need all of you to support it.
[01:27:30.319 --> 01:27:31.420]  We're going in.
[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:33.881]  Europe said we're not going to support you any.
[01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:36.902]  And they basically made noises that they're probably going to hit.
[01:27:37.918 --> 01:27:39.699]  Well, I think you've got it.
[01:27:39.699 --> 01:27:47.802]  The scenario that I wrote in Atomic Iran, again published in 2005, I wrote it again in the showdown with Nuclear Iran.
[01:27:47.802 --> 01:28:02.088]  The second book I published in Iran was that Israel would come to a point where they couldn't wait any longer, just like with the strike in Syria of the nuclear plant that was being built by the North Koreans, which just happened a few months ago.
[01:28:02.088 --> 01:28:04.229]  I think it's a Samson option.
[01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:07.650]  Israel comes to a point where they're not going to take the risk that
[01:28:08.317 --> 01:28:15.241]  Ahmadinejad and Iran will have enough uranium refined to be able to make one or more weapons.
[01:28:15.241 --> 01:28:20.544]  Well, Doc, I agree with you on almost everything you say until we get into this whole World War III thing.
[01:28:20.544 --> 01:28:29.810]  Are you saying you really believe that Israel is threatened when it's got 400 nukes, and Iran doesn't even have one, and the CIA's own assessment says they're years away from it?
[01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:36.674]  Well, I don't think... I think from Israel's point of view, with Ahmadinejad threatening constantly
[01:28:37.330 --> 01:28:41.553]  And saying that he wants Israel gone, he wants Israel eliminated.
[01:28:41.553 --> 01:28:46.416]  Well, he said if they attack him today, that they're going to strike back.
[01:28:46.416 --> 01:28:56.022]  Well, yes, he said today the defense minister, this was now Mustafa Mohammed Najjar, at a news conference.
[01:28:56.022 --> 01:29:06.809]  He said basically, when they're saying this coming from, it's going back and forth, the minister in Iran said basically they would retaliate if attacked.
[01:29:07.543 --> 01:29:08.724]  Okay, I want to break down what you think.
[01:29:27.293 --> 01:29:33.639]  Yeah, I want to hear what you think's going to unfold and when and what the repercussions will be militarily, economically, societally.
[01:29:33.639 --> 01:29:35.441]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, long segment coming up.
[01:29:35.441 --> 01:29:36.842]  Your phone calls as well.
[01:29:36.842 --> 01:29:41.226]  Stay with us.
[01:29:41.226 --> 01:29:42.608]  We're on the march.
[01:29:42.608 --> 01:29:45.150]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.150 --> 01:29:47.812]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:51.072 --> 01:29:52.594]  Attention GCN listeners!
[01:29:52.594 --> 01:29:56.919]  You've all heard of 9-1-1 in plain sight, Beyond Treason, and One Nation Under Siege.
[01:29:56.919 --> 01:30:00.323]  But did you know that all of these documentaries were created by one man?
[01:30:00.323 --> 01:30:02.706]  Civil rights activist and filmmaker William Lewis.
[01:30:02.706 --> 01:30:05.930]  Now Mr. Lewis has produced his most patriotic documentary to date.
[01:30:05.930 --> 01:30:07.772]  A film about taking back our government.
[01:30:07.932 --> 01:30:14.717]  Washington, you're fired, was born out of sheer frustration with abuses in our current political system, and it gives a voice to Americans across the country.
[01:30:14.717 --> 01:30:27.986]  Washington, you're fired, examines constitutional issues as they relate to the Katrina disaster, the president's illegal spy program, NSA data mining, FISA's secret court, the illegal wiretapping of millions of Americans, and the last seven years of terror-related spy bills.
[01:30:28.266 --> 01:30:30.287]  How they affect you and what you can do about it.
[01:30:50.859 --> 01:30:52.841]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:30:52.841 --> 01:30:56.445]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:30:56.445 --> 01:30:58.907]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:30:58.907 --> 01:31:01.950]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:07.676]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:31:07.676 --> 01:31:11.600]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:17.124]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:31:17.124 --> 01:31:20.166]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[01:33:16.952 --> 01:33:18.053]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:18.053 --> 01:33:19.654]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:19.654 --> 01:33:23.497]  Monday through Friday back live with an abbreviated Sunday late edition.
[01:33:23.497 --> 01:33:25.319]  4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:25.319 --> 01:33:31.565]  Central Standard Time on the AM FM dial, Global Shortwave Satellite, and of course the Internet.
[01:33:32.345 --> 01:33:39.350]  At Infowars.com, TruthNews.us, Infowars.net, JonesReport.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:47.815]  We're going to go back to Dr. Jerome Corsi, author of The Late Great USA that we sell at Infowars.com at a discounted price.
[01:33:47.815 --> 01:33:52.378]  Here in just one moment, I totally agree with him on the North American Union, the treasonous globalists, all of it.
[01:33:52.378 --> 01:34:01.464]  We disagree about, at least in the past, about wars in the Middle East, but his views on that have moderated somewhat, I would say, and also he now looks at 9-11 as a possible
[01:34:02.011 --> 01:34:03.812]  False flag or at least allowing it to happen.
[01:34:03.812 --> 01:34:06.093]  We'll get his take on that coming up.
[01:34:06.093 --> 01:34:08.755]  But we're going to go to Dr. Corsi in just a minute.
[01:34:08.755 --> 01:34:09.875]  So I respect Dr. Corsi.
[01:34:09.875 --> 01:34:14.758]  I mean, he's somebody who we've seen, even not just on this show, I've heard him on others talk about the things we talk about.
[01:34:14.758 --> 01:34:20.061]  He's really, I don't want to say he's changed, but he's siding with the United States instead of with the New World Order.
[01:34:20.641 --> 01:34:28.228]  Now, even though, you know, he helped shoot down Kerry, who was New World Order II with a swift boating, he's got a new book coming out about Barack Obama.
[01:34:28.228 --> 01:34:30.950]  I want to get his take on that before he leaves us.
[01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:34.513]  No doubt, Barack Obama is bad news, but what do you do when there's the wicked McCain?
[01:34:34.513 --> 01:34:36.074]  It's a no choice.
[01:34:36.074 --> 01:34:37.636]  It's a choice between Satan and Lucifer.
[01:34:37.636 --> 01:34:40.438]  We're going to go back to Dr. Corsi here and your phone calls in one moment.
[01:34:42.205 --> 01:34:48.431]  Before I do that, again, I want to encourage you to get in-game Blueprint for Global Enslavement and help expose the Bilderberg Group and the true shadow government.

[01:35:07.707 --> 01:35:11.370]  Let me tell you first about New Vitality.

[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:02.300]  Are you
[01:37:22.176 --> 01:37:37.783]  In a climate-controlled area, more than 10 years, and 10 years in un-climate-controlled, 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.com, huge banners at the top of infowars.com, and prisonplanet.com.
[01:37:37.783 --> 01:37:44.166]  Alright, going back to Dr. Corsi, and then Mark, Rusty, Steve, Randy, Tyler, and others, we gotta move quick now, Doctor.
[01:37:44.166 --> 01:37:45.607]  Continuing with your analysis,
[01:37:46.407 --> 01:37:48.548]  I mean, where do you stand on a war?
[01:37:48.548 --> 01:37:51.069]  I mean, I've been hearing you on air.
[01:37:51.069 --> 01:37:52.930]  Are you against Israel attacking Iran?
[01:37:52.930 --> 01:37:53.691]  I mean, are you against this?
[01:37:53.691 --> 01:37:56.232]  I'm opposed to any kind of a war against Iran.
[01:37:56.232 --> 01:37:59.413]  I don't think a war with Iran is going to solve the problem.
[01:37:59.413 --> 01:38:04.336]  I predicted in both of the books I wrote, going back to atomic Iran, that a war would happen.
[01:38:04.336 --> 01:38:06.597]  That does not mean I'm in favor of it.
[01:38:06.597 --> 01:38:10.879]  I predicted that Israel would attack, and I've always predicted that Israel would be
[01:38:11.331 --> 01:38:19.353]  Get to this point where they wouldn't know if Iran could produce a nuclear weapon once they think it's possible they'll attack.
[01:38:19.353 --> 01:38:24.434]  And I've predicted that the United States will support Israel in that attack, even though we won't initiate it.
[01:38:24.434 --> 01:38:30.735]  I think it'll be a disastrous war, a disastrous expansion of violence in the Middle East.
[01:38:30.735 --> 01:38:36.596]  In the Middle East, I've said for a long time that war is the problem, it's not the solution.
[01:38:36.596 --> 01:38:41.117]  Rabin managed to convince me of that, and his wife Leah Rabin managed to convince me of that.
[01:38:41.613 --> 01:38:43.134]  After Rabin's death.
[01:38:43.134 --> 01:38:49.657]  After every death in the Middle East, another generation of revenge and violence is perpetuated.
[01:38:49.657 --> 01:38:51.738]  It won't solve any problems.
[01:38:51.738 --> 01:38:53.719]  And we've got troops in the area.
[01:38:53.719 --> 01:38:59.022]  The Shahab-3 missile that Iran has is more than capable of killing thousands of U.S.
[01:38:59.022 --> 01:39:01.804]  troops, even with conventional warheads.
[01:39:01.804 --> 01:39:04.725]  And the war there is not a video game.
[01:39:04.725 --> 01:39:07.807]  It's not like we're going to send in our planes and missiles and hit
[01:39:08.639 --> 01:39:10.739]  It's going to be over in 24 hours.
[01:39:10.739 --> 01:39:12.840]  That's not reality.
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:14.280]  Reality is a war with Iran.
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:20.141]  It's a very big, difficult war that won't end quickly and might not end successfully.
[01:39:20.141 --> 01:39:25.222]  And it's a bad idea because it will perpetuate more generations of violence.
[01:39:25.222 --> 01:39:29.323]  They're also talking about $500 a barrel oil if that happens.
[01:39:29.323 --> 01:39:31.183]  Well, it's possible.
[01:39:31.183 --> 01:39:37.864]  I mean, I think that the $200 a barrel that we're looking at that Goldman Sachs says is the next horizon
[01:39:38.476 --> 01:39:41.357]  I'm saying $155 a barrel.
[01:39:41.357 --> 01:39:44.779]  I think that's already starting to price in the likelihood of a war.
[01:39:44.779 --> 01:39:50.901]  Because you've got increasing statements coming out of Israel saying, you know, the Olmert government's in trouble.
[01:39:50.901 --> 01:39:53.803]  It could launch scandals internal into the country.
[01:39:53.803 --> 01:39:56.124]  You could have the Olmert government fall any day.
[01:39:56.124 --> 01:39:58.605]  You've got Netanyahu in the wings.
[01:39:58.605 --> 01:40:03.967]  If Netanyahu takes over, he's going to be in a much more hawkish position against Iran.
[01:40:04.901 --> 01:40:05.181]  I don't
[01:40:22.526 --> 01:40:25.888]  You know, these boats that Iran has out of the Gulf.
[01:40:25.888 --> 01:40:28.789]  And that turned out to be staged, fake audio transmissions.
[01:40:28.789 --> 01:40:31.670]  The whole thing turned out to be a nothing event.
[01:40:31.670 --> 01:40:38.093]  Let's be clear, you're saying that Israel or the elements of the United States could stage an event as a pretext for war?
[01:40:38.093 --> 01:40:38.834]  I worry about it.
[01:40:38.834 --> 01:40:39.954]  It could happen.
[01:40:39.954 --> 01:40:41.295]  We did it in the Tunkin Gulf.
[01:40:41.295 --> 01:40:43.516]  It was a staged incident.
[01:40:43.516 --> 01:40:48.398]  Well, it's now been declassified NSA that Israel knowingly attacked the USS Liberty.
[01:40:48.398 --> 01:40:50.559]  Look, any incident
[01:40:50.959 --> 01:40:59.603]  Manufactured or otherwise could easily escalate to cause a war with Iran and it would be a disastrous mistake.
[01:40:59.603 --> 01:41:09.188]  But the same point of view, you've got Iran continuing not to listen to the world pressure, even offers to accept uranium from Russia.
[01:41:09.188 --> 01:41:19.573]  And today, you see on Drudge, with President Bush in Europe, he's asking the European Union to step up sanctions and put additional pressure, even to the point of cutting
[01:41:20.194 --> 01:41:22.996]  Iran off from the World Banking System.
[01:41:22.996 --> 01:41:25.137]  Now, steps like that were taken.
[01:41:25.137 --> 01:41:28.099]  I think this can escalate very quickly.
[01:41:28.099 --> 01:41:37.405]  And if it does escalate and go into a military direction, Alex, it's unpredictable because you've got the Russians supporting Iran.
[01:41:37.405 --> 01:41:41.168]  They've sold some very sophisticated surface-to-air missile systems to Iran.
[01:41:41.168 --> 01:41:45.330]  Iran has put around their nuclear installations.
[01:41:45.330 --> 01:41:49.493]  China is in oil and natural gas deals with Iran.
[01:41:50.355 --> 01:41:56.288]  Both China and Russia have asked Iran to consider joining the Shanghai Cooperation League.
[01:41:56.288 --> 01:41:57.812]  I don't think Russia is going to sit by.
[01:42:01.864 --> 01:42:05.027]  Let's set that aside for a moment.
[01:42:05.027 --> 01:42:07.308]  Let's say Russia and China don't get involved.
[01:42:07.308 --> 01:42:10.671]  Iran is 65 million people, not 21 million like Iraq.
[01:42:10.671 --> 01:42:18.016]  It is still an industrialized nation, not after, you know, 12, 14 years of bombardment before it was taken over.
[01:42:18.016 --> 01:42:21.639]  They have tens of thousands of missiles that can hit any of the U.S.
[01:42:21.639 --> 01:42:23.520]  globalist-controlled ships in the Gulf.
[01:42:24.859 --> 01:42:32.244]  We have all of this happening, and we know the Iranians are going to sink a bunch of ships there in the channels, blocking up the oil.
[01:42:32.244 --> 01:42:33.625]  They've said they'll do that.
[01:42:33.625 --> 01:42:40.810]  They've said that they're going to then attack our forces, and again I need to be clear, now controlled by the globalists, in Iraq.
[01:42:40.810 --> 01:42:43.092]  They're going to turn the Shiites completely loose.
[01:42:43.092 --> 01:42:45.414]  Iraq is going to descend into bedlam.
[01:42:46.254 --> 01:42:48.715]  We have the different battle plans from Israel and the U.S.
[01:42:48.715 --> 01:43:06.238]  that Cy Hirsch and others have released, and the Pentagon admits are accurate, between 150 and 3,000 targets, depending on which plan being hit, blowing up their Navy, tens of thousands of Saudis over several months, bombing all their infrastructure, water treatment, roads, anything that, quote, could aid military, all their research facilities.
[01:43:06.238 --> 01:43:08.499]  They're talking about using bunker busters.
[01:43:08.499 --> 01:43:12.920]  They say if Iran fights back in any way, then tactical nukes may be used.
[01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:17.603]  I mean, we're talking about total insanity, and we're talking about the U.S.'
[01:43:17.583 --> 01:43:19.884]  's stock dropping even further.
[01:43:19.884 --> 01:43:26.888]  This will definitely bring the world into a global depression, and it will accelerate the inflationary spiral.
[01:43:26.888 --> 01:43:27.528]  That's my view.
[01:43:27.528 --> 01:43:28.549]  Your view, Dr. Gorsuch?
[01:43:28.549 --> 01:43:31.071]  Well, I've been totally opposed to it.
[01:43:31.071 --> 01:43:39.195]  Remember, in 2005, Alex, I walked 200 miles with the Iranian expatriates after I wrote Atomic Iran.
[01:43:39.195 --> 01:43:40.136]  We walked from the
[01:43:40.928 --> 01:43:47.953]  Liberty Bell to Washington, D.C., and I was urging at that time the support for the Iranian expatriates.
[01:43:47.953 --> 01:43:54.238]  There's over a million of them in the United States, and the freedom fighters within Iran who want to change their own country.
[01:43:54.238 --> 01:44:03.645]  If we supported the freedom fighters, you could have, like you saw, the Orange Revolution in the Ukraine, or we stopped apartheid in South Africa.
[01:44:03.645 --> 01:44:05.006]  The Velvet Revolution?
[01:44:05.006 --> 01:44:06.547]  There's other ways to have
[01:44:07.065 --> 01:44:10.687]  Political change affected in the world at war.
[01:44:10.687 --> 01:44:11.607]  Let me bring this up to you.
[01:44:11.607 --> 01:44:12.247]  Let me bring this up to you.
[01:44:12.247 --> 01:44:14.768]  And I like, I want the Iranians to do it themselves.
[01:44:14.768 --> 01:44:20.271]  I don't want to dictate or see the United States try to dictate what should happen in Iran.
[01:44:20.271 --> 01:44:32.296]  Now, Sy Hersh, again, we reported this before he did, but it's now been confirmed, reported four years ago that known Wahhabi groups out of Saudi Arabia that have also been attacking U.S.
[01:44:32.296 --> 01:44:34.797]  troops have now been hired by the U.S.
[01:44:34.797 --> 01:44:36.578]  And I talked to a colonel this weekend who was admitting it.
[01:44:37.456 --> 01:44:43.921]  Uh, that they're using, quote, the number three in Al-Qaeda to command one of the forces, bombing police stations, blowing up mosques.
[01:44:43.921 --> 01:44:50.927]  The Iranians have been sitting there taking that, and the White House last year put out a press release and said, yes, we are backing, quote, these Mujahideen groups.
[01:44:50.927 --> 01:44:53.249]  Well, those Mujahideen groups are Wahhabi Al-Qaeda.
[01:44:53.889 --> 01:45:02.576]  And then we've got McCain and others and Betrayus coming out and saying that Iran is running Al-Qaeda.
[01:45:02.576 --> 01:45:12.604]  Now that is asinine for our criminal government to be running known Al-Qaeda groups, known Wahhabis against the Shiite government of Iran, and then to have the media double back and claim Iran is Al-Qaeda.
[01:45:12.604 --> 01:45:13.685]  Your take?
[01:45:13.685 --> 01:45:17.448]  Well again, I can't prove any of the things you're talking about here.
[01:45:17.448 --> 01:45:20.511]  I haven't researched them or reported on them myself.
[01:45:20.511 --> 01:45:21.752]  What I am concerned about
[01:45:22.295 --> 01:45:26.876]  They have reported on the difficulties in terms of Pakistan.
[01:45:26.876 --> 01:45:37.840]  I think we could easily expand the war into Pakistan, going into this northwestern section of Pakistan where our intelligence agencies believe Osama Bin Laden is still hiding.
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:49.744]  I'm also concerned that, you know, with regards to the ethnic issues, you've got within, you know, both Iraq and Iran are not just Sunnis and Shiites.
[01:45:50.376 --> 01:46:03.024]  You've got the Kurds in the northern part of both Iraq and Iran, and you've had both Turkish and Iranian violence against the Kurds, both in Iran and in Iraq.
[01:46:03.024 --> 01:46:09.468]  But that's because also, I'm not picking sides here, you know the Kurds have been running around killing the police and military of Turkey.
[01:46:09.468 --> 01:46:15.731]  Well, you know, not picking sides, I'm just saying that there's an ethnic element to this as well.
[01:46:15.731 --> 01:46:19.614]  The Kurds want to establish Kurdistan, and you could very easily have the
[01:46:20.356 --> 01:46:23.342]  The United States expand the violence into Iran.
[01:46:23.342 --> 01:46:25.706]  And this is how World War I and World War II started.
[01:46:25.706 --> 01:46:26.528]  It's very similar.
[01:46:26.528 --> 01:46:31.558]  These are the kinds of conflicts that, you know, one thing leads to another.
[01:46:32.202 --> 01:46:34.283]  That triggered World War One.
[01:46:34.283 --> 01:46:39.587]  Okay, listen, Doctor, I want to get back into some of the things happening economically.
[01:46:39.587 --> 01:46:45.550]  We've all heard NPR, all heard the quote liberals brag about how soon Americans won't have the same standard of living.
[01:46:45.550 --> 01:46:47.291]  We deserve to not have oil.
[01:46:47.291 --> 01:46:48.432]  We deserve to be controlled.
[01:46:48.432 --> 01:46:50.033]  We deserve to stop consuming so much.
[01:46:50.033 --> 01:46:56.457]  That's the whole point of their fake global carbon tax that both McCain and Obama are supporting.
[01:46:56.457 --> 01:46:58.218]  The people don't support it, but they don't care.
[01:46:59.198 --> 01:47:00.759]  We now see what is happening.
[01:47:00.759 --> 01:47:04.662]  I want to point out, this economic system we're seeing unfold is by design.
[01:47:04.662 --> 01:47:05.943]  A. Do you concur?
[01:47:05.943 --> 01:47:07.243]  B. Where do you see it going?
[01:47:07.243 --> 01:47:14.448]  Well, I argue that, like Great USA, that we would see the dollar drop, but we would see a major recession hit.
[01:47:14.448 --> 01:47:19.291]  Again, because it would push us into a solution, which would be a North American Union.
[01:47:19.291 --> 01:47:21.912]  One of the major themes of the late Great USA.
[01:47:21.912 --> 01:47:26.795]  What I see happening right now is that, you know, look, the stock market's headed back towards $12,000.
[01:47:28.174 --> 01:47:34.758]  We twice now, in recent months, within the last year or 18 months, traded under $12,000.
[01:47:34.758 --> 01:47:37.199]  I think we're going to start trading under $12,000 again.
[01:47:37.199 --> 01:47:42.062]  The stock market today is struggling to gain 50 points, as we're talking.
[01:47:42.062 --> 01:47:46.285]  It's been losing all day from its high.
[01:47:46.285 --> 01:47:50.947]  I think oil is going to increase in value, in price, and the dollar is going to continue to drop.
[01:47:50.947 --> 01:47:53.489]  I think these are manipulated crises.
[01:47:54.110 --> 01:47:56.112]  There's abundant oil in the world.
[01:47:56.112 --> 01:47:59.254]  I've argued in the late great USA that it's abiotic.
[01:47:59.254 --> 01:48:02.417]  It's not created by... Well, that's not even arguable.
[01:48:02.417 --> 01:48:04.618]  It's absolutely a scientific fact.
[01:48:04.618 --> 01:48:06.880]  It's just the public's so dumbed down they don't know it.
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:12.145]  And we, you know, we're finding, as predicted by the abiotic theory, we're finding deep earth oil.
[01:48:12.145 --> 01:48:14.987]  Well, more than that, we're not just finding... Huge finds off the coast of Brazil.
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:19.961]  Yeah, well they're finding 16,000 foot deep wells in Texas, mega-wells.
[01:48:19.961 --> 01:48:22.422]  The old wells are also filling back up.
[01:48:22.422 --> 01:48:23.602]  Well, no question about it.
[01:48:23.602 --> 01:48:31.964]  There have been capped wells all through the United States that today could be not only because the technology has improved, but to some extent they've replenished.
[01:48:31.964 --> 01:48:34.445]  But you've got wells at deep levels that
[01:48:34.932 --> 01:48:37.614]  You are far below where our geologists would ever look.
[01:48:37.614 --> 01:48:39.976]  And natural gas, abundant natural gas.
[01:48:39.976 --> 01:48:49.262]  And let me just add, because I have a family that works in the oil fields, they are hitting 15, 14, 16,000 deep wells in each Texas that are, they're spindle top.
[01:48:49.262 --> 01:48:55.467]  I mean, we're talking about millions of cubic feet of gas a day, each well tens of thousands of barrels a week.
[01:48:55.467 --> 01:48:58.109]  I mean, these deep wells are mega huge.
[01:48:58.109 --> 01:49:02.292]  Just go to Deep Trek, it's T-R-E-K, Deep Trek, it's part of the U.S.
[01:49:02.756 --> 01:49:10.421]  The Department of Energy's website, and they document abundant natural gas three miles below the surface of the Earth in the continental United States.
[01:49:10.421 --> 01:49:12.962]  Also unconventional oil.
[01:49:12.962 --> 01:49:22.288]  Go back to the Fischer-Tropsch processes that were developed by the chemists in Weimar, Germany, and that the Nazis used to produce oil out of coal.
[01:49:22.288 --> 01:49:24.009]  We've got oil shale.
[01:49:24.009 --> 01:49:27.711]  We've got the oil tars, which are up in Alberta, Canada.
[01:49:27.711 --> 01:49:31.373]  There's hundreds of years of oil in those two resources alone.
[01:49:32.045 --> 01:49:36.833]  Got the Bracken Field now in Montana and South Dakota, which even the U.S.
[01:49:36.833 --> 01:49:39.178]  Geological Service has validated.
[01:49:39.178 --> 01:49:42.523]  Don't have 150 million barrels of recoverable reserves.
[01:49:43.123 --> 01:49:46.286]  Somewhere between 3.4 and 4 billion barrels.
[01:49:46.286 --> 01:49:47.086]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[01:49:47.086 --> 01:49:48.668]  We are swimming in oil.
[01:49:48.668 --> 01:49:49.768]  There's plenty of it.
[01:49:49.768 --> 01:49:53.652]  And the Congress is blaming the oil companies who have shut down a lot of refineries.
[01:49:53.652 --> 01:49:54.793]  We have their own memos.
[01:49:54.793 --> 01:49:57.495]  But they are small players in the fraud.
[01:49:57.495 --> 01:50:02.319]  It is the fact that the big oil companies and governments are not allowing its extraction.
[01:50:02.319 --> 01:50:07.503]  And I would demand that the oil companies stop operating as international oligopolies.
[01:50:07.503 --> 01:50:09.385]  They're sitting on supply.
[01:50:09.385 --> 01:50:11.106]  We've got to change the tax incentives.
[01:50:11.681 --> 01:50:15.123]  And really think hard about these international oil companies.
[01:50:15.123 --> 01:50:17.805]  That's right, or they are going to fully destroy the global economy.
[01:50:17.805 --> 01:50:19.246]  And they do it at their advantage.
[01:50:19.246 --> 01:50:23.508]  They're doing it to get the price of oil as high as they can get it at this point.
[01:50:23.508 --> 01:50:26.390]  I mean, I'd say let's think creatively about states.
[01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:29.552]  I think South Dakota voted to put a refinery in.
[01:50:29.552 --> 01:50:33.374]  Let's give tax breaks to states that put refineries in.
[01:50:33.374 --> 01:50:35.716]  Hell, how about they pay no taxes?
[01:50:35.716 --> 01:50:39.438]  Let's get the oil companies to have only tax incentives if they increase supply.
[01:50:40.137 --> 01:50:40.698]  Absolutely.
[01:50:40.698 --> 01:50:45.325]  Dr. Corsi, stay with me for this segment and one more because I want to get to the callers on the other side.
[01:50:45.325 --> 01:50:47.368]  His new book's coming out on Barack Obama.
[01:50:47.368 --> 01:50:49.531]  Let me talk to him during the break, see if I can get him to hold even longer.
[01:50:51.664 --> 01:50:55.005]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.
[01:50:55.005 --> 01:51:02.747]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[01:51:02.747 --> 01:51:10.590]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[01:51:10.590 --> 01:51:16.872]  At HempUSA.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.
[01:51:17.492 --> 01:51:24.261]  Please call 1-908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[01:51:24.261 --> 01:51:27.085]  Beware, be smart, and be ready!
[01:51:27.085 --> 01:51:28.487]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org.
[01:51:33.433 --> 01:51:39.760]  Families need this high-quality natural food source for its low price and long storage shelf life.
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:43.724]  This incredible food source should be a staple part of your diet every day.
[01:51:43.724 --> 01:51:51.351]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org today.
[01:51:51.351 --> 01:51:52.773]  It is a big idea.
[01:51:52.773 --> 01:51:55.596]  A new world order.
[01:51:55.596 --> 01:51:56.397]  In the near future.
[01:51:57.395 --> 01:52:00.479]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:52:00.479 --> 01:52:03.302]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:52:03.302 --> 01:52:06.085]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[01:52:06.085 --> 01:52:09.268]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:52:09.268 --> 01:52:16.597]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:25.064]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:52:25.064 --> 01:52:28.926]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:52:28.926 --> 01:52:31.488]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:52:31.488 --> 01:52:32.669]  Most people have no idea.
[01:52:32.669 --> 01:52:33.449]  They're not after money.
[01:52:33.449 --> 01:52:34.730]  They have all the money they need.
[01:52:34.730 --> 01:52:35.711]  They're after power.
[01:52:35.711 --> 01:52:36.852]  That's what they're after these years.
[01:52:36.852 --> 01:52:45.597]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:45.597 --> 01:52:46.338]  Endgame.
[01:52:46.338 --> 01:52:48.379]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:52:48.379 --> 01:52:49.420]  You have been warned.
[01:52:51.681 --> 01:52:56.083]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[01:52:56.083 --> 01:52:58.224]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[01:52:58.224 --> 01:53:03.607]  GasFreedom.info has the information you need to learn about a simple technology you can have right now.
[01:53:03.607 --> 01:53:08.049]  Gas Freedom is a do-it-yourself, affordable, practical, free energy device.
[01:53:08.049 --> 01:53:12.671]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[01:53:12.671 --> 01:53:12.971]  HHO also
[01:53:14.292 --> 01:53:14.933]  Thanks for watching!
[01:53:30.956 --> 01:53:33.957]  The wicked genius Lennon said that there are times in history when more happens
[01:54:01.167 --> 01:54:05.791]  In a month than happened in the previous 100 years.
[01:54:05.791 --> 01:54:16.519]  Well, with the advent of advanced technologies and global population, that system has only accelerated itself.
[01:54:16.519 --> 01:54:24.025]  We're going to see more change in the next year, the next 10 years, than we've seen in 6,000 years of human history.
[01:54:24.025 --> 01:54:26.687]  Modern human history.
[01:54:26.687 --> 01:54:27.387]  This is it.
[01:54:27.387 --> 01:54:28.008]  We're alive.
[01:54:28.823 --> 01:54:35.646]  During amazing times when the future of humanity and its course will be set.
[01:54:35.646 --> 01:54:39.988]  We're going to go to your phone calls now on a host of issues.
[01:54:39.988 --> 01:54:42.389]  Dr. Kors is going to stay with us 15-20 minutes in the next hour.
[01:54:42.389 --> 01:54:45.831]  Before he leaves us, he'll talk some about his new Barack Obama book coming out.
[01:54:45.831 --> 01:54:52.173]  He can't say much about Obama Nation because he's barred from doing that, but if we can get his take on Barack Obama.
[01:54:52.173 --> 01:54:54.775]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in South Carolina.
[01:54:54.775 --> 01:54:55.435]  You're on the air, Mark.
[01:54:56.567 --> 01:54:57.988]  How do you do, Alex?
[01:54:57.988 --> 01:55:02.132]  First of all, I'd like to start off by thanking you.
[01:55:02.132 --> 01:55:06.315]  Infowars.com aired my story on your website.
[01:55:06.315 --> 01:55:13.641]  I'm running for office here in South Carolina, and I was on the debate against some pretty, I believe, corrupt politicians.
[01:55:13.641 --> 01:55:22.248]  And I shot them down for their bad policies, and immediately, the week after, my home gets broken into.
[01:55:22.248 --> 01:55:23.930]  I receive threatening phone calls.
[01:55:24.614 --> 01:55:25.295]  All these things.
[01:55:25.295 --> 01:55:29.998]  I'm doing everything I can to fight the global agenda here in my local county, just as best as I can.
[01:55:29.998 --> 01:55:40.705]  And, uh, you know, I've been listening to you for years, and everything you talked about, about how these people try to strike back at you, how they get in your face and try to intimidate you, make you fear and cower, was true.
[01:55:40.705 --> 01:55:43.267]  And, uh, I want to thank you personally for airing that story.
[01:55:43.267 --> 01:55:46.289]  It's personally made me and my wife feel much, much safer.
[01:55:46.289 --> 01:55:48.871]  And, uh, it's... Now, I saw your story.
[01:55:48.871 --> 01:55:51.453]  Let me talk to Dr. Corsi about that.
[01:55:51.453 --> 01:55:53.074]  He probably doesn't know your story, but...
[01:55:54.019 --> 01:55:58.122]  Dr. Corsi, the government's just going so criminal.
[01:55:58.122 --> 01:56:01.924]  I mean, everything, the corruption is just getting worse and worse and worse.
[01:56:01.924 --> 01:56:04.226]  Now, what's happening?
[01:56:04.226 --> 01:56:05.187]  What is the story about?
[01:56:05.187 --> 01:56:09.029]  In a nutshell, tell him what happened.
[01:56:09.029 --> 01:56:12.031]  Well, long story short, I'm running for office.
[01:56:12.031 --> 01:56:15.714]  I'm an underdog candidate with no money, been doing this out of my house.
[01:56:15.714 --> 01:56:19.276]  And I've been watching Alex for years and just got inspired to do something about it.
[01:56:19.276 --> 01:56:23.359]  So I decided to run for office and stick up for true non-neocon principles.
[01:56:24.099 --> 01:56:36.082]  And, long story short, I get on the live TV debate here in Horry County and, you know, I shoot these guys down for, you know, taking funds from organizations and the companies that hire illegal immigrants.
[01:56:36.082 --> 01:56:38.323]  Just, I believe, un-American principles.
[01:56:38.323 --> 01:56:48.685]  Well, the weekend of, I get threatening phone calls and my wife calls me one night and says that my house has been broken into.
[01:56:48.685 --> 01:56:50.426]  I drive down there to make sure she's okay.
[01:56:51.317 --> 01:56:55.900]  I get in the house, turn on all the lights, and in the middle of our floor is a smiley face.
[01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:59.722]  Someone broke into our house and drew a smiley face.
[01:56:59.722 --> 01:57:06.306]  And all the signs that I've been making in my hand, I made about six or seven, maybe ten by now, but they were all gone.
[01:57:06.306 --> 01:57:07.186]  And there was only one.
[01:57:07.186 --> 01:57:07.987]  Now I put them out.
[01:57:07.987 --> 01:57:10.148]  I'm going to have to get you back on for the full story later.
[01:57:10.148 --> 01:57:11.109]  I appreciate it.
[01:57:11.109 --> 01:57:12.510]  We'll get in contact and have you on, sir.
[01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:14.050]  But let me just say this.
[01:57:14.050 --> 01:57:14.671]  That's my point.
[01:57:14.671 --> 01:57:16.712]  There's a lot of money sucking off government.
[01:57:16.712 --> 01:57:18.793]  You've got little corrupt systems everywhere.
[01:57:18.793 --> 01:57:19.794]  Dr. Corsi comments.
[01:57:20.498 --> 01:57:29.882]  Well, you know, I don't know the whole story, so it's hard to comment on it, but I've been, you know, clearly it sounds like the harassment that is unacceptable.
[01:57:29.882 --> 01:57:32.443]  I've got another story that I wrote relatively today.
[01:57:32.443 --> 01:57:37.686]  I'm following how many of the statistics the government is quitting to publish.
[01:57:37.686 --> 01:57:43.148]  The government just announced they're not going to publish reports any longer on foreign investment in the United States.
[01:57:43.148 --> 01:57:46.349]  The whole series of reports that are going to be discontinued.
[01:57:46.349 --> 01:57:47.630]  And I've put that together.
[01:57:48.297 --> 01:58:00.528]  With the same way the government quit reporting M3 data, which is the money supply data, quit reporting that just before the Fed pumped huge amounts of liquidity into the banking system.
[01:58:00.528 --> 01:58:04.572]  M3 is growing at like 16% right now.
[01:58:04.572 --> 01:58:13.000]  I think this means that the Bush administration is getting ready for a whole wave of foreign investment in here to buy banks and corporate assets.
[01:58:13.470 --> 01:58:15.091]  And not reported to the American people.
[01:58:15.091 --> 01:58:15.551]  That's right.
[01:58:15.551 --> 01:58:17.673]  They are handing the entire country over.
[01:58:17.673 --> 01:58:22.636]  They will suck it dry and leave a rear guard of paramilitary death squads to rule over us.
[01:58:22.636 --> 01:58:24.257]  The country is dying.
[01:58:24.257 --> 01:58:27.278]  This is the end of the republic unless we screen body murder.
[01:58:27.278 --> 01:58:33.142]  Dr. Corsi will be back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:33.142 --> 01:58:35.643]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:59:55.433 --> 02:00:00.736]  You know, it's really funny that Dr. Corsi just brought up how the Department of
[02:00:18.064 --> 02:00:25.327]  Commerce and others are not going to put out reports anymore about ports being taken over, infrastructure, roads by foreign companies.
[02:00:25.327 --> 02:00:28.308]  Now that we're going to be like the peso with the dollar, they can just come in and buy everything.
[02:00:28.308 --> 02:00:30.349]  It's over.
[02:00:30.349 --> 02:00:32.150]  I mean, literally, I've been telling you this for years.
[02:00:32.150 --> 02:00:33.651]  This is them imploding us.
[02:00:33.651 --> 02:00:35.151]  This is them blowing us out to get us.
[02:00:35.151 --> 02:00:37.472]  This is the IMF World Bank plan.
[02:00:37.472 --> 02:00:40.994]  I've been covered in panic since 2002.
[02:00:40.994 --> 02:00:43.935]  I got another late notice from the Department of the Census
[02:00:44.921 --> 02:00:47.702]  And under the law, I spent two hours last night reading it.
[02:00:47.702 --> 02:00:50.143]  You just got to tell them how many people live in your house.
[02:00:50.143 --> 02:00:58.286]  You don't have to answer the business questions unless you're a big global corporation engaged in mining or interstate commerce.
[02:00:58.286 --> 02:00:59.366]  And I went and read all the laws.
[02:00:59.366 --> 02:01:01.407]  I knew the laws, but I wanted to double-check it.
[02:01:01.407 --> 02:01:02.167]  It's not true.
[02:01:02.167 --> 02:01:04.048]  It's just made-up lies.
[02:01:04.048 --> 02:01:09.810]  And they say, yeah, every month you're gonna have to answer all these hundreds of questions for us and file reports under perjury.
[02:01:09.810 --> 02:01:12.071]  And you have to waive your Fifth Amendment.
[02:01:12.071 --> 02:01:14.112]  But if you don't do this, we'll arrest you and fine you.
[02:01:14.952 --> 02:01:17.974]  And you go read it, and that's not what it says.
[02:01:17.974 --> 02:01:20.976]  The government is completely criminal.
[02:01:20.976 --> 02:01:22.357]  Bankrupt.
[02:01:22.357 --> 02:01:30.343]  But meanwhile, foreigners, who've always had to tell what they're buying, what they're doing, who they're... what politicians they're talking to... I mean, it's like John McCain.
[02:01:30.343 --> 02:01:35.167]  He went to England, met with the Rothschilds, made hundreds of thousands of dollars at a campaign meeting.
[02:01:35.167 --> 02:01:38.809]  It was admitted to be totally illegal, and the Feds just said, we're doing nothing.
[02:01:38.809 --> 02:01:41.111]  Dr. Corsi, I mean, it's lawlessness.
[02:01:42.833 --> 02:01:47.656]  It scares me and it frightens me when the government decides not to publish certain statistics.
[02:01:47.656 --> 02:02:06.446]  I mean, the nature of not publishing data on the foreign investment in the United States, showing the amount, where it comes from, what kind of companies they're buying, trends, just like not publishing M3 data on the money supply, there's only one reason not to publish the data.
[02:02:06.446 --> 02:02:10.008]  That's because the government intends to do something they don't want people knowing about.
[02:02:10.444 --> 02:02:11.785]  And Doctor, I'll tell you what worries me.
[02:02:11.785 --> 02:02:13.246]  I'll tell you what worries me.
[02:02:13.246 --> 02:02:17.328]  The fact that they're breaking all the laws, getting so criminal, means they're going to go for broke.
[02:02:17.328 --> 02:02:18.189]  Total police state.
[02:02:18.189 --> 02:02:22.391]  I mean, they're acting like nothing's going to stop them, and they just don't care.
[02:02:22.391 --> 02:02:32.537]  Well, certainly the pressure that you see right now on the dollar, and, you know, with oil, the commodity price is increasing so dramatically, this is going to build to a crisis point.
[02:02:32.537 --> 02:02:37.520]  I mean, at $4 a gallon, people are feeling pain, but at $5 a gallon,
[02:02:39.013 --> 02:02:43.115]  I think people are going to be feeling economic distress to the point where they can't function.
[02:02:43.115 --> 02:02:50.158]  They won't be able to go to work and earn enough to both pay for the gasoline and the groceries and the rent.
[02:02:50.158 --> 02:02:56.401]  And at that kind of a squeezing of the middle class, you've got up the building here of a perfect storm.
[02:02:56.401 --> 02:03:07.687]  You've got already massive foreclosures going on across the country with home prices devaluing, such that people are holding mortgages that are in excess of the value of the home.
[02:03:08.206 --> 02:03:11.068]  They can't sell the home and get out from the mortgage.
[02:03:11.068 --> 02:03:14.349]  This kind of a crisis is a meltdown.
[02:03:14.349 --> 02:03:22.534]  And the solution, as I wrote in Like Great USA, the people are going to be presented, is to say the only way we can solve these problems is to move into a regional economy.
[02:03:23.063 --> 02:03:28.627]  The same way Europe did, we have to have a North American Union and a new currency, the Amaro.
[02:03:28.627 --> 02:03:40.054]  And Robert Pastor, the dean of all this, as you've written in the book and as I cover in an endgame, they admit they're going to create an economic crisis and then offer the solution of the North American Union.
[02:03:40.054 --> 02:03:49.000]  Well, Robert Pastor wrote the next 9-11, maybe what it would be needed to further the agenda to integrate North America.
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.922]  And I called him up and interviewed him about that because he made the comment
[02:03:52.481 --> 02:03:56.742]  In a Spanish-language publication that I guess he thought no one would read.
[02:03:56.742 --> 02:03:58.542]  And he said, yeah, he did make the comment.
[02:03:58.542 --> 02:04:18.187]  Now, he was saying he didn't want a 9-11 to cause it, but even to make the comment, even that he's suggesting that he's thinking that the next 9-11-type crisis could push North American integration, suggests that he's got in his mind the idea that we're going to utilize these crises, economic or political or terrorism,
[02:04:18.840 --> 02:04:21.381]  To further our global agenda.
[02:04:21.381 --> 02:04:24.783]  And we have the neocons writing news articles about it.
[02:04:24.783 --> 02:04:28.324]  We have tapes of Rumsfeld talking about how a new 9-11 is needed.
[02:04:28.324 --> 02:04:32.106]  I mean, Doc, it gets pretty obvious, doesn't it?
[02:04:32.106 --> 02:04:35.687]  Well, and I think the main thing I'm concerned about right now is Iran.
[02:04:35.687 --> 02:04:38.028]  I think that's the next crisis on the horizon.
[02:04:38.028 --> 02:04:38.408]  Stay there.
[02:04:38.408 --> 02:04:40.549]  We're going to talk to Rusty, Steve, Randy, and Tyler.
[02:04:40.549 --> 02:04:41.930]  That's it for calls.
[02:04:41.930 --> 02:04:46.352]  Straight ahead, final segment with Dr. Corsi, then an exclusive on the fire at the mansion.
[02:04:48.206 --> 02:04:52.789]  With the hot and muggy season upon us, most people shut their windows to stay cool.
[02:04:52.789 --> 02:04:57.592]  The problem is, the air you breathe inside your home is not as clean as outdoor air.
[02:04:57.592 --> 02:05:02.815]  And who wants an ugly, plastic, noisy air purifier taking up space in their beautiful home?
[02:05:02.815 --> 02:05:04.696]  Well, there is an alternative.

[02:07:48.072 --> 02:08:03.958]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:03.958 --> 02:08:07.880]  I want to explain to all the police and military people, FBI and others that listen to this show.
[02:08:09.508 --> 02:08:11.529]  We told you who the globalists are.
[02:08:11.529 --> 02:08:14.051]  We told you years before what they were going to do.
[02:08:14.051 --> 02:08:15.452]  Do you understand me?
[02:08:15.452 --> 02:08:17.973]  They are destroying our fiat dollar.
[02:08:17.973 --> 02:08:21.235]  It's basically all we had economically going for us.
[02:08:21.235 --> 02:08:23.897]  So they can come in and buy up the entire economy.
[02:08:23.897 --> 02:08:27.679]  Do you understand the government is bankrupt and criminal?
[02:08:27.679 --> 02:08:30.581]  Do you understand your support of this criminal government?
[02:08:30.581 --> 02:08:32.502]  Like Fox said about Mark Dice earlier,
[02:08:33.098 --> 02:08:35.919]  You know, oh, the troops that are fighting for the government.
[02:08:35.919 --> 02:08:38.881]  No, they supposedly fight for us, and we don't want the war.
[02:08:38.881 --> 02:08:40.381]  80 plus percent of us in polls.
[02:08:40.381 --> 02:08:40.962]  It's illegal.
[02:08:40.962 --> 02:08:41.802]  It's criminal.
[02:08:41.802 --> 02:08:43.143]  It's based on lies.
[02:08:43.143 --> 02:08:45.063]  Don't you understand?
[02:08:45.063 --> 02:08:46.864]  The globalists are internationalists.
[02:08:46.864 --> 02:08:48.245]  They're not patriotic.
[02:08:48.245 --> 02:08:52.387]  They wrap their agendas in the American flag and sell you on it.
[02:08:52.387 --> 02:08:55.468]  Now, we have people inside the governor's mansion coming on in about 20 minutes.
[02:08:55.468 --> 02:08:57.249]  This is huge, but I want to run through your calls fast.
[02:08:57.642 --> 02:09:02.824]  Yeah, I was out of town last week as a Bilderberg, and I've talked about it.
[02:09:02.824 --> 02:09:07.046]  It's raised $250,000, and it's just amazing, and it will all go towards expanding what we're doing here, 100% of it.
[02:09:07.046 --> 02:09:10.367]  And I tell you what, at the very end of the show today, I will give a five-minute update on that.
[02:09:10.367 --> 02:09:11.547]  You may have missed some updates I did.
[02:09:26.795 --> 02:09:29.496]  Okay, do you have a decent trip to Chantilly?
[02:09:29.496 --> 02:09:30.756]  I missed your show yesterday.
[02:09:30.756 --> 02:09:31.377]  It was hellish.
[02:09:31.377 --> 02:09:32.497]  Okay.
[02:09:32.497 --> 02:09:34.478]  But it was also invigorating.
[02:09:34.478 --> 02:09:34.718]  Okay.
[02:09:34.718 --> 02:09:46.942]  Having huge cop after huge military intelligence after, you know, huge, you know, killer, you know, former special forces flipping us off, threatening us, coming up and saying, hey, do you want to attack the State Department?
[02:09:46.942 --> 02:09:48.982]  Yeah, it was just wearing clown mask.
[02:09:48.982 --> 02:09:51.063]  I mean, it was just unbelievable.
[02:09:51.063 --> 02:09:53.144]  But we did it and it was a great victory for Liberty.
[02:09:53.144 --> 02:09:53.884]  I appreciate your call.
[02:09:54.887 --> 02:09:56.028]  You bet.
[02:09:56.028 --> 02:09:59.630]  Steven Colorado, you're on the air with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[02:09:59.630 --> 02:10:00.851]  Yeah, hi there, you guys.
[02:10:00.851 --> 02:10:02.472]  I have three questions.
[02:10:02.472 --> 02:10:09.677]  The first one, Jerry, you had mentioned about Robert Pastor had written in a Spanish-language magazine.
[02:10:09.677 --> 02:10:12.499]  Do you have the date of that?
[02:10:12.499 --> 02:10:22.406]  Yeah, he wrote a bunch of WorldNet Daily and Human Events articles about it over a year ago, and I'm just backing him up here, and he called Pastor and did an interview about it.
[02:10:22.406 --> 02:10:22.906]  Go ahead, Doc.
[02:10:23.635 --> 02:10:24.135]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:10:24.135 --> 02:10:28.778]  I'd have to look it up myself here, but it was one of the World Net Daily articles I wrote last year.
[02:10:28.778 --> 02:10:29.578]  I'll search for it.
[02:10:29.578 --> 02:10:31.299]  What are your other questions?
[02:10:31.299 --> 02:10:32.400]  Oh, okay.
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:41.625]  Then the second one was, what was the name of that guy that you said, Tim, and then I don't know what his last name was, that spoke at the Economic Club of New York?
[02:10:41.625 --> 02:10:43.846]  It was a president?
[02:10:43.846 --> 02:10:46.647]  He was a banker from the New York Federal Reserve.
[02:10:46.647 --> 02:10:47.208]  His name was
[02:10:48.231 --> 02:10:51.213]  Tim Geithner.
[02:10:51.213 --> 02:10:54.336]  G-E-I-T-H-N-E-R.
[02:10:54.336 --> 02:10:56.798]  Timothy Geithner.
[02:10:56.798 --> 02:11:01.021]  He is one of the top bankers in New York in the Federal Reserve System.
[02:11:01.021 --> 02:11:06.065]  He gave a speech this past week.
[02:11:06.065 --> 02:11:11.729]  He said that basically we needed greater world global control over the central banks
[02:11:12.475 --> 02:11:12.755]  I think so.
[02:11:25.891 --> 02:11:29.376]  And if you link through, it's the Financial Times of London.
[02:11:29.376 --> 02:11:30.878]  We have a link to that.
[02:11:30.878 --> 02:11:31.939]  And let me take you to the other one.
[02:11:31.939 --> 02:11:37.005]  There's another article that was in RogueGovernment.com, wrote a story about it.
[02:11:37.005 --> 02:11:39.669]  We have one up on Infowars.com.
[02:11:39.669 --> 02:11:42.052]  So this is them saying, it's a Gethner.
[02:11:42.572 --> 02:11:47.814]  New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner, who was on the Bilderberg Group list, along with Fed Chairman Bernanke.
[02:11:47.814 --> 02:11:49.395]  We videotaped him going in and out.
[02:11:49.395 --> 02:11:53.577]  Then in Bilderberg 2008, along with Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve Chairman, Henry Paulson, the U.S.
[02:11:53.577 --> 02:12:00.840]  Treasury Secretary, Jean-Claude Trichet, the President of the European Central Bank, Robert Zoellick, the President of the World Bank, and other high-profile bankers.
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:02.020]  Does that answer your question?
[02:12:02.020 --> 02:12:02.921]  Yes.
[02:12:02.921 --> 02:12:06.542]  And the article in World Net Daily that I wrote about Pasteur was on December 15, 2006.
[02:12:08.877 --> 02:12:13.019]  And then the last one is, Alex, you had mentioned that there was a White House press release
[02:12:32.343 --> 02:12:35.144]  Uh, a little over a year ago that said that the U.S.
[02:12:35.144 --> 02:12:36.825]  was backing who in Iraq?
[02:12:36.825 --> 02:12:39.385]  Yeah, I would say it was about nine months ago.
[02:12:39.385 --> 02:12:46.548]  It was in mid-2007 and the White House announced that it was supporting, quote, Mujahideen forces, three different groups.
[02:12:47.348 --> 02:12:48.869]  We know they're supporting Ford, actually.
[02:12:48.869 --> 02:12:50.290]  It's been all over the news.
[02:12:50.290 --> 02:12:51.010]  I don't have it.
[02:12:51.010 --> 02:12:52.611]  Go to WhiteHouse.gov.
[02:12:52.611 --> 02:12:54.992]  And also, New Yorker Magazine reported on it.
[02:12:54.992 --> 02:12:57.153]  I mean, it was basically like talking about the sun coming up in the morning.
[02:12:57.153 --> 02:13:00.375]  This is known by anyone who's looked at hundreds of articles.
[02:13:00.375 --> 02:13:02.636]  I mean, have you heard about Iran suing the U.S.
[02:13:02.636 --> 02:13:04.858]  for staging terror attacks inside Iran?
[02:13:04.858 --> 02:13:09.400]  And then top generals going on Fox, admitting it and saying how great it is?
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:13.762]  Also, while we've been talking, since I've been on the program, the stock market has gone negative.
[02:13:13.762 --> 02:13:14.923]  It was about 80 points up this
[02:13:15.632 --> 02:13:17.913]  Morning, and I think it'll end negative today.
[02:13:17.913 --> 02:13:19.594]  It went down, what, 400 points yesterday?
[02:13:19.594 --> 02:13:22.695]  Yes, and it's headed negative again today.
[02:13:22.695 --> 02:13:35.260]  Also, the International Energy Agency just released this afternoon a report that said that worldwide oil demand was at a five-year low.
[02:13:35.260 --> 02:13:37.621]  It's a six-year low.
[02:13:38.616 --> 02:13:40.137]  It's going to fall further.
[02:13:40.137 --> 02:13:46.479]  That's right, people are cutting back on use because it's so expensive, but still it skyrockets at the opposite of supply and demand.
[02:13:46.479 --> 02:14:00.463]  Expecting that world oil demand is going to grow just 0.9% or 800,000 barrels a day this year, where their original growth estimate was for 2.18 million barrels a day of growth.
[02:14:00.463 --> 02:14:02.504]  That's a dramatic revision.
[02:14:02.504 --> 02:14:06.665]  So they're saying that world oil demand is at its lowest point in six years.
[02:14:07.475 --> 02:14:14.137]  Which means that, you know, this price spike is more directly a result of the decline in the value of the U.S.
[02:14:14.137 --> 02:14:19.779]  dollar, speculation, and fear being priced into the possibility of another war in the Middle East.
[02:14:19.779 --> 02:14:20.359]  That's right.
[02:14:20.359 --> 02:14:24.400]  Everybody is, with any asset, is grabbing anything tangible and real.
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:26.961]  This is global meltdown in the beginning stages.
[02:14:26.961 --> 02:14:27.761]  Do you agree, Doctor?
[02:14:27.761 --> 02:14:28.782]  Thank you, Steve, for the call.
[02:14:28.782 --> 02:14:31.422]  Do you agree, Doctor, that we've only seen the beginning?
[02:14:31.422 --> 02:14:32.323]  It's just the beginning.
[02:14:33.482 --> 02:14:39.866]  We've seen the implosion of the bubble, you know, the bubble's burst, the mortgage markets imploded.
[02:14:39.866 --> 02:14:44.249]  This crisis in debt instruments has hit the U.S.
[02:14:44.249 --> 02:14:44.729]  banking.
[02:14:44.729 --> 02:14:47.931]  And that's a small bubble compared to the derivative of $600 trillion.
[02:14:47.931 --> 02:14:50.733]  The derivative of $600 trillion.
[02:14:50.733 --> 02:14:59.419]  And one of the reasons, I think, Geithner is calling for this worldwide control, I've also been following some controls being called for on the Bank of International Development.
[02:14:59.419 --> 02:15:01.060]  I think they're very concerned that these
[02:15:01.570 --> 02:15:06.795]  Derivatives could implode the same way that the mortgage market is imploding in the United States.
[02:15:25.853 --> 02:15:35.161]  They already took over in 1913 here, 200 years ago in 1815 after the Battle of Waterloo with the Rothschild scam in London.
[02:15:35.161 --> 02:15:36.182]  I'm already getting too detailed.
[02:15:36.182 --> 02:15:43.227]  The point is, they control the banking, they flooded the world with fiat numbers, not even currency and liquidity.
[02:15:43.227 --> 02:15:46.890]  They then bought real assets, infrastructure, defense stocks, energy stocks.
[02:15:47.350 --> 02:15:48.591]  ...positioned themselves.
[02:15:48.591 --> 02:15:50.773]  They bought real assets with fiat.
[02:15:50.773 --> 02:15:53.535]  They then got us into debt to own us through fiat.
[02:15:53.535 --> 02:16:03.122]  They are now artificially restricting the credit to the general public while giving themselves unlimited credit to buy up what they don't have that is left over.
[02:16:03.122 --> 02:16:15.292]  And they are now purposely using these walls and hundreds of trillions of dollars to forcibly buy up governments, police, military, paying off the troops with hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash apiece to be part of merc armies,
[02:16:15.812 --> 02:16:20.794]  This is a total, complete, economic, military attack on free humanity.
[02:16:20.794 --> 02:16:21.474]  Dr. Corsi?
[02:16:21.474 --> 02:16:30.217]  Yeah, and what you're seeing right now, the concern by the central bankers is that the crisis is going to be used to increase more globalism.
[02:16:30.217 --> 02:16:32.038]  I think the whole thing looks manufactured.
[02:16:32.038 --> 02:16:37.860]  I mean, right now the world demand is not justifying the price increases in oil.
[02:16:37.860 --> 02:16:39.281]  It's just not there.
[02:16:39.281 --> 02:16:43.683]  And the price increases have further slowed world oil demand.
[02:16:43.683 --> 02:16:44.583]  This is not a
[02:16:45.307 --> 02:16:49.550]  Normal price reflecting supply restrictions.
[02:16:49.550 --> 02:16:58.515]  Yeah, they own the money machines, they bought the world up with it, and they took over the police because if we struggle becoming slaves, they're going to put us in camps and admit they built them.
[02:16:58.515 --> 02:17:00.116]  We're going into hell.
[02:17:00.116 --> 02:17:02.177]  And the middle class is going to be, again, suffering.
[02:17:02.177 --> 02:17:07.660]  The middle class is going to be struggling to make ends meet with oil continuing to increase in price.
[02:17:07.660 --> 02:17:10.682]  Gasoline, I think, is going to go up through the summer.
[02:17:10.682 --> 02:17:14.164]  And I foresee, despite the world demand lowering, I think we're going to see 145
[02:17:15.464 --> 02:17:15.904]  I don't think so.
[02:17:26.292 --> 02:17:37.719]  All right, while government spending explodes out of control and more and more cops riding tickets, more and more bureaucrats, just hell on earth, people losing their jobs, being fed on by predatory government, absolutely criminal and running wild.
[02:17:37.719 --> 02:17:39.880]  Randy, in Michigan, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:43.662]  Yes, Alex, this is great that I actually made it through the lines, finally, to talk to my hero.
[02:17:43.662 --> 02:17:48.525]  And I have a question for the doctor, as well as a statement for you, a confirmation rather.
[02:17:48.525 --> 02:17:51.567]  My eyes were open initially, you know, with your Terror Storm DVD.
[02:17:51.567 --> 02:17:53.748]  I got a horrible history lesson, but it's all true.
[02:17:55.231 --> 02:17:59.574]  I just wonder, like, I've seen your YouTube video with the massive pulling over.
[02:17:59.574 --> 02:18:04.036]  I think you were in Texas and you videotaped it with the cops in the speed trap zone.
[02:18:04.036 --> 02:18:05.457]  And it freaked me out.
[02:18:05.457 --> 02:18:06.838]  And of course, I'm in Southeast Michigan.
[02:18:06.838 --> 02:18:08.039]  That was a giant checkpoint.
[02:18:08.039 --> 02:18:09.540]  They shut Interstate 35 down.
[02:18:09.540 --> 02:18:14.723]  Yeah, and they did something like that here on Groesbeck Highway, right in Clinton Township, Michigan.
[02:18:14.723 --> 02:18:15.203]  They did it.
[02:18:15.203 --> 02:18:19.005]  And they pulled over my girlfriend and I. I was on the show earlier talking about it a month ago.
[02:18:19.005 --> 02:18:21.547]  But anyways, I got a question also about
[02:18:22.062 --> 02:18:24.723]  Yeah, the Iran thing for the doctor.
[02:18:24.723 --> 02:18:29.386]  What's going to happen if we attack a nation that's, you know, three times the size landmass of France?
[02:18:29.386 --> 02:18:30.947]  I mean, are they going to annihilate us?
[02:18:30.947 --> 02:18:37.110]  Because look what Iraq's doing, and like Alex said earlier, you've got how many million as opposed to 65 million in Iran.
[02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:43.153]  Well, we'll mobilize the Iranians against us, but right now the Iranian people are very positive towards the United States.
[02:18:43.153 --> 02:18:44.894]  It will strengthen the hardliners.
[02:18:44.894 --> 02:18:49.277]  It will strengthen the hardliners, and it's not clear that we would throw out the regime.
[02:18:49.277 --> 02:18:49.897]  We might actually
[02:18:50.543 --> 02:18:52.564]  Get the regime support by attacking them.
[02:18:52.564 --> 02:18:54.665]  Oh, it will entrench them permanently.
[02:18:54.665 --> 02:19:10.232]  And, you know, the regime, even if we destroy a good deal of the nuclear apparatus in an attack, and it's not clear it will be successful, because the Russians have sold them anti-service air missile defense systems, which will even hit now cruise missiles.
[02:19:10.232 --> 02:19:12.033]  11,000 of the missile units.
[02:19:12.033 --> 02:19:15.315]  And so, you know, the nuclear establishment
[02:19:16.005 --> 02:19:22.346]  ...of Iran could be built back very quickly, especially with the justification, look, we did get attacked.
[02:19:22.346 --> 02:19:25.227]  They'll get all the international justification... Doc, let me twist your arm.
[02:19:25.227 --> 02:19:26.547]  I know you've got another interview coming up.
[02:19:26.547 --> 02:19:26.967]  Quick break.
[02:19:26.967 --> 02:19:30.448]  I want to come back and talk about Obama briefly and end it with a call from Tyler.
[02:19:30.448 --> 02:19:31.068]  Stay there, Doc.
[02:19:31.068 --> 02:19:32.068]  One more segment, if you can.
[02:19:32.068 --> 02:19:33.088]  We'll find out on the other side.
[02:19:33.088 --> 02:19:34.648]  A huge exclusive.
[02:19:34.648 --> 02:19:38.069]  Tell everybody you know, especially in Austin, on the local stations, to tune in.
[02:19:38.069 --> 02:19:41.369]  A huge exclusive inside on the governor's mansion.
[02:19:41.369 --> 02:19:42.590]  This is going to blow you away.
[02:19:42.590 --> 02:19:44.410]  This is huge breaking news.
[02:19:48.322 --> 02:19:50.925]  Do you stay up late worrying about your teen driver?
[02:19:50.925 --> 02:19:54.290]  Do you need to know the exact location of a loved one or a company vehicle?
[02:19:54.290 --> 02:19:58.295]  What can you do if your vehicle becomes one of the thousands annually targeted for theft?
[02:19:58.295 --> 02:20:05.264]  Now you can log into your own personal website and view the exact location of your vehicle, stationary or moving, in real time.
[02:20:05.724 --> 02:20:06.645]  24 hours a day.

[02:20:48.123 --> 02:20:49.204]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:20:49.204 --> 02:20:54.150]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:20:54.150 --> 02:21:02.219]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:21:02.219 --> 02:21:07.565]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:21:07.785 --> 02:21:15.066]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:21:15.066 --> 02:21:20.648]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:21:20.648 --> 02:21:25.728]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:21:25.728 --> 02:21:33.310]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:21:33.670 --> 02:21:40.233]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:21:40.233 --> 02:21:44.094]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:44.094 --> 02:21:44.695]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:44.695 --> 02:21:49.497]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:21:49.497 --> 02:21:53.118]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:21:53.118 --> 02:21:54.939]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:21:55.479 --> 02:21:58.602]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:21:58.602 --> 02:22:04.347]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:22:04.347 --> 02:22:08.590]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:22:08.590 --> 02:22:13.795]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:22:13.795 --> 02:22:16.837]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[02:22:45.663 --> 02:22:46.423]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:48.854 --> 02:22:54.938]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[02:22:54.938 --> 02:23:00.883]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[02:23:00.883 --> 02:23:05.045]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[02:23:05.045 --> 02:23:09.949]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[02:23:10.189 --> 02:23:18.693]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[02:24:07.048 --> 02:24:08.449]  Final segment with Dr. Corsi.
[02:24:08.449 --> 02:24:10.570]  We have Waiting in the Wings, David.
[02:24:10.570 --> 02:24:12.711]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:24:12.711 --> 02:24:14.452]  About the Governor's Mansion fire.
[02:24:14.452 --> 02:24:15.553]  Very, very suspicious.
[02:24:15.553 --> 02:24:17.534]  Huge exclusive coming up in about seven minutes.
[02:24:18.328 --> 02:24:27.056]  I want to take one call from Tyler in Washington State, if we have time, Dr. Corsi, but he can't say a lot about his new book coming out in the next month and a half, Simon & Schuster, Obama Nation.
[02:24:27.056 --> 02:24:29.258]  He's had bestseller after bestseller.
[02:24:29.258 --> 02:24:32.901]  We have discounted his Laker at USA at InfoWars.com.
[02:24:32.901 --> 02:24:33.422]  Amazing.
[02:24:33.422 --> 02:24:41.569]  Anybody that's questioning the North American Union, get them a copy of this book, full of documents, full of diagrams, their own internal stuff that we had to sue to get, that his judicial watch did.
[02:24:42.887 --> 02:24:44.148]  Barack Obama.
[02:24:44.148 --> 02:24:45.528]  Both candidates are Bilderberg.
[02:24:45.528 --> 02:24:47.329]  Both are backed up.
[02:24:47.329 --> 02:24:48.389]  We were talking during the break.
[02:24:48.389 --> 02:24:56.273]  You were saying, though, that we need to weaken the government, and that McCain would be weaker, that Obama has this cult of personality.
[02:24:56.273 --> 02:24:59.894]  What really makes Obama tick, without you giving too much away about the book?
[02:24:59.894 --> 02:25:02.955]  Well, just to say, you know, and the book is under embargo.
[02:25:02.955 --> 02:25:06.117]  It's going to be called Obama Nation.
[02:25:06.117 --> 02:25:07.817]  And I use that pun intentionally.
[02:25:10.074 --> 02:25:16.856]  It's going to be Simon & Schuster publishing at this time, which I think should get a very wide and big distribution for it.
[02:25:16.856 --> 02:25:23.737]  Obama's got a cult of personality, and I think this cult of personality, whenever it occurs in politics, is very frightening.
[02:25:23.737 --> 02:25:27.638]  History does not look well upon leaders who ride the cult of personality.
[02:25:27.638 --> 02:25:33.299]  It tends to produce dictators, and it tends to produce very disastrous endings.
[02:25:33.299 --> 02:25:34.439]  I can say that much about it.
[02:25:34.439 --> 02:25:36.240]  The rest is under embargo.
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:36.780]  It's up on
[02:25:37.412 --> 02:25:39.613]  It's up already on Amazon.com.
[02:25:39.613 --> 02:25:43.094]  You can see the book, but there's no cover on it yet.
[02:25:43.094 --> 02:25:45.094]  I'll be carrying it.
[02:25:45.094 --> 02:25:45.835]  Here's the deal.
[02:25:45.835 --> 02:25:46.215]  He's got it.
[02:25:46.215 --> 02:25:47.315]  We'll get it for you.
[02:25:47.315 --> 02:25:50.716]  I'll say this, and I've analyzed it, and I'm not going to vote for McCain or him.
[02:25:50.716 --> 02:25:51.676]  I'm not picking candidates.
[02:25:51.676 --> 02:25:52.857]  I could care less if he's black.
[02:25:52.857 --> 02:25:56.638]  He could be green, and I'd vote for him if he was a constitutionalist.
[02:25:56.638 --> 02:26:04.180]  But bottom line, or bright glowing albino white like the albino vampire McCain, I could care less about their skin pigment.
[02:26:05.531 --> 02:26:09.014]  The problem is, I see him getting bigger globalist support.
[02:26:09.014 --> 02:26:14.778]  I see the establishment flipping sides over to him, even over the wicked witcher, the West Hillary.
[02:26:14.778 --> 02:26:19.682]  I've never seen such elite support than what we see with Barack Obama.
[02:26:19.682 --> 02:26:23.485]  And you talked about him in the break being a Bilderberg presidential candidate.
[02:26:23.485 --> 02:26:24.987]  I mean, talk about something separate from the book.
[02:26:24.987 --> 02:26:26.948]  What's your take on Obama?
[02:26:26.948 --> 02:26:31.612]  Well, you know, again, let's go on to, I think there's going to be plenty in the book on Obama.
[02:26:32.453 --> 02:26:42.841]  And I just see that McCain here is a guy who, you know, I've fought McCain for eight years on a variety of issues, including securing the borders.
[02:26:42.841 --> 02:26:44.963]  But McCain does not have a cult of personality.
[02:26:44.963 --> 02:26:47.405]  In fact, McCain hardly has a personality.
[02:26:47.405 --> 02:26:48.986]  That's one of his problems.
[02:26:48.986 --> 02:26:49.607]  He's older.
[02:26:49.607 --> 02:26:51.568]  He's not going to be as powerful.
[02:26:51.568 --> 02:26:57.193]  He's going to be more easily influenced, more easily willing to listen to the people.
[02:26:57.193 --> 02:27:01.356]  So I think you've got more opportunity to have a president of McCain who would be
[02:27:01.963 --> 02:27:02.463]  Swayed.
[02:27:02.463 --> 02:27:05.745]  But I certainly did not write this book to promote McCain.
[02:27:05.745 --> 02:27:07.666]  I can't bring myself to promote McCain.
[02:27:07.666 --> 02:27:10.228]  I think, you know, I've been fighting McCain.
[02:27:10.228 --> 02:27:14.130]  If he's president, I expect to continue fighting him.
[02:27:14.130 --> 02:27:18.052]  But bottom line, we want a weak president, like the founder said.
[02:27:18.052 --> 02:27:20.893]  We don't want a strong... I agree.
[02:27:20.893 --> 02:27:28.738]  I mean, the whole system of the government, the counter-balances between the executive, the legislative, the judicial, is meant to have weak
[02:27:30.191 --> 02:27:30.572]  I don't know.
[02:27:44.026 --> 02:27:46.687]  Is, uh, has been a disaster for America.
[02:27:46.687 --> 02:27:48.247]  Here's an example.
[02:27:48.247 --> 02:27:48.947]  Here's an example.
[02:27:48.947 --> 02:27:53.448]  If Bush had the charisma, and I personally, you know, look at Obama.
[02:27:53.448 --> 02:27:54.549]  He's very charismatic.
[02:27:54.549 --> 02:27:55.789]  I don't dislike him.
[02:27:55.789 --> 02:28:01.570]  He doesn't have all the baggage of a Hillary or somebody, so I tend to, at a gut level, you know, not hate him as much.
[02:28:01.570 --> 02:28:03.411]  But exactly, that's a great danger.
[02:28:03.411 --> 02:28:06.612]  Imagine if Bush would have had the charisma of Obama.
[02:28:06.612 --> 02:28:10.213]  I mean, the establishment's behind him for a reason.
[02:28:10.213 --> 02:28:10.773]  Well, that's right.
[02:28:12.637 --> 02:28:22.121]  A president who has less charisma, who has a more difficult time getting his policies implemented, more difficult time with Congress.
[02:28:22.121 --> 02:28:31.544]  I think the American people may give Congress continued control to the Democrats, but I don't think the American people are going to give the presidency also to the Democrats.
[02:28:31.544 --> 02:28:34.165]  The American people like to divide power between the parties.
[02:28:34.165 --> 02:28:38.287]  And I think Obama is going to have a very hard time in the general election.
[02:28:38.287 --> 02:28:40.468]  And I've written this book to bring out a lot of things.
[02:28:41.311 --> 02:28:42.772]  Looking forward to its publication.
[02:28:42.772 --> 02:28:45.973]  The embargo will be over on August 12th, and that'll be around very soon.
[02:28:45.973 --> 02:28:48.473]  I want to have you on August 12th.
[02:28:48.473 --> 02:28:56.476]  We'll work it out with you, Alex, and put you in touch with Simon & Schuster so that you'll get the ability to distribute the books directly through your radio show.
[02:28:56.476 --> 02:28:56.876]  Thank you.
[02:28:56.876 --> 02:29:00.537]  In closing, are you predicting, are you saying, 60-40?
[02:29:00.537 --> 02:29:02.198]  Who are you saying you think's going to win right now?
[02:29:02.198 --> 02:29:03.018]  Who do you think's going to win?
[02:29:03.018 --> 02:29:04.039]  McCain's going to win.
[02:29:04.039 --> 02:29:05.119]  McCain will be the next president.
[02:29:06.184 --> 02:29:07.285]  Oh my gosh, that's horrible.
[02:29:07.285 --> 02:29:13.510]  When people learn what's in this book, and when we fully vet Obama, Obama, you know, will not be president.
[02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:14.571]  You better watch yourself.
[02:29:14.571 --> 02:29:16.913]  The elite wants Obama.
[02:29:16.913 --> 02:29:20.195]  Well, they'll have to pick another guy.
[02:29:20.195 --> 02:29:22.297]  Well, you called it right on Kerry, but that didn't matter.
[02:29:22.297 --> 02:29:23.278]  They were both cousins.
[02:29:23.278 --> 02:29:24.319]  Dr. Corzine, thank you.
[02:29:24.319 --> 02:29:29.583]  McCain is going to be a very tough election, and I don't think Obama's going to win.
[02:29:29.583 --> 02:29:30.403]  You heard it here.
[02:29:30.403 --> 02:29:31.584]  It's going to be a slug-out.
[02:29:31.584 --> 02:29:32.165]  A slug-out.
[02:29:32.165 --> 02:29:33.386]  Doc, thanks for joining us.
[02:29:34.375 --> 02:29:37.016]  Thanks Alex, great pleasure and honored to be back with you again.
[02:29:37.016 --> 02:29:38.657]  You bet.
[02:29:38.657 --> 02:29:42.578]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:42.578 --> 02:29:45.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:48.444 --> 02:29:51.346]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[02:29:51.346 --> 02:29:55.748]  Matthew 24 states four times, in the last days many will be deceived.
[02:29:55.748 --> 02:29:59.310]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the Antichrist.
[02:29:59.310 --> 02:30:03.072]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the Antichrist?
[02:30:03.072 --> 02:30:06.994]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[02:30:06.994 --> 02:30:12.277]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo, the national ID card, or 666?
[02:30:12.277 --> 02:30:15.258]  Is the Antichrist a person, title, or both?
[02:30:15.258 --> 02:30:16.859]  Some believe these things are in the future.
[02:30:17.179 --> 02:30:19.162]  Others believe that it's in the past.
[02:30:19.162 --> 02:30:21.024]  1 John states, Friends, these answers are in the Bible.

[02:30:37.423 --> 02:30:37.883]  Or call 888-211-1715.
[02:30:37.883 --> 02:30:38.243]  That's 888-211-1715.
[02:30:38.243 --> 02:30:38.923]  It is a big idea.
[02:30:38.923 --> 02:30:40.283]  A new world order in the near future.
[02:30:54.511 --> 02:30:57.573]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:30:57.573 --> 02:31:00.414]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:31:00.414 --> 02:31:03.196]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:31:03.196 --> 02:31:06.378]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:31:06.378 --> 02:31:13.702]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:31:16.744 --> 02:31:22.170]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:31:22.170 --> 02:31:26.053]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:31:26.053 --> 02:31:28.616]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:31:28.616 --> 02:31:29.797]  Most people have no idea.
[02:31:29.797 --> 02:31:30.578]  They're not after money.
[02:31:30.578 --> 02:31:31.839]  They have all the money they need.
[02:31:31.839 --> 02:31:32.840]  They're after power.
[02:31:32.840 --> 02:31:33.981]  That's what they're after.
[02:31:33.981 --> 02:31:38.166]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:31:38.626 --> 02:31:42.832]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're gonna start taking this hemp.
[02:31:42.832 --> 02:31:44.093]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[02:31:57.383 --> 02:32:01.845]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[02:32:01.845 --> 02:32:04.607]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[02:32:04.607 --> 02:32:07.048]  They keep you down, they keep you blue.
[02:32:07.048 --> 02:32:11.990]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:14.431]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[02:32:14.431 --> 02:32:19.794]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[02:32:21.727 --> 02:32:26.312]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[02:32:26.312 --> 02:32:31.136]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:32:31.136 --> 02:32:36.101]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[02:32:36.101 --> 02:32:40.585]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:32:40.585 --> 02:32:42.808]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.

[02:32:49.424 --> 02:33:16.483]  I thought you were sleeping They came and took it all away The lanes and the meadows The places where you used to play It was an inside job By the well connected
[02:33:19.288 --> 02:33:25.092]  It was an inside job at the Governor's Mansion.
[02:33:25.092 --> 02:33:31.537]  Texas Governor's Mansion, formerly the White House, the Republic of Texas.
[02:33:31.537 --> 02:33:34.519]  141 in the morning, a 911 call gets made.
[02:33:34.519 --> 02:33:36.040]  I've been down to the mansion, I've interviewed
[02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:45.282]  The individual that was there and called in the 9-1-1 call, Alonzo Perez, that's up on InfoWars.com, that YouTube interview with him.
[02:33:45.282 --> 02:33:48.483]  I come up and talk to the state police and others, show you the fire damage.
[02:33:48.483 --> 02:33:51.825]  I mean, we, for 15 people, this is like a major news agency.
[02:33:51.825 --> 02:33:52.825]  I'm really proud of everybody.
[02:33:52.825 --> 02:33:55.886]  I'm glad we're expanding, about to move into bigger offices.
[02:33:55.886 --> 02:33:57.886]  But that's a huge job in and of itself.
[02:33:57.886 --> 02:33:59.447]  We are just taking action here.
[02:34:00.129 --> 02:34:05.873]  Ladies and gentlemen, headline yesterday, PrisonPlanet.com, suspicion surrounds Governor's Mansion Fire.
[02:34:05.873 --> 02:34:18.280]  News stations question how blaze that gutted a 152-year-old building could have been started under the watchful eye of surveillance cameras and DPS troopers who were garrisoned right there in another building, 50 yards from where the fire started.
[02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:25.524]  Then a couple hundred yards across the street, you have more than 25 DPS officers, a state police special unit.
[02:34:25.524 --> 02:34:27.886]  Capitol Police is their state police designation.
[02:34:28.686 --> 02:34:35.388]  And then they lied and said they called 9-1-1 immediately, but the eyewitness said no one was there.
[02:34:35.388 --> 02:34:38.129]  He got there, saw the fire, called 9-1-1.
[02:34:38.129 --> 02:34:41.110]  It took him about 15 minutes to arrive at the fire department.
[02:34:41.110 --> 02:34:46.951]  Then the state police showed up right after them coming out of the Capitol.
[02:34:46.951 --> 02:34:51.872]  He saw no one coming out of the side house there.
[02:34:55.939 --> 02:34:56.980]  I know the Governor's Mansion.
[02:34:56.980 --> 02:35:05.467]  I've been at a couple film events there years ago, and I got invited to the Texas Film Association, Film Society.
[02:35:05.467 --> 02:35:11.772]  I'll never forget First Lady now, Laura Bush, seeing me and running over and asking why I was there.
[02:35:11.772 --> 02:35:12.192]  That was like in 1997.
[02:35:18.146 --> 02:35:19.867]  Four cameras in one tree that I've seen.
[02:35:19.867 --> 02:35:23.510]  There are cameras on every corner of the building itself and on the fence.
[02:35:23.510 --> 02:35:27.312]  There is a 8-foot wrought iron fence with spikes on the top.
[02:35:27.312 --> 02:35:33.416]  They had another construction fence that was 10 feet tall to 8 feet tall, depending on which section around that.
[02:35:33.416 --> 02:35:36.518]  We're to believe someone scaled it, went in and set fire to the building.
[02:35:37.685 --> 02:35:39.826]  There are motion sensors all over it.
[02:35:39.826 --> 02:35:41.187]  That is admitted.
[02:35:41.187 --> 02:35:46.591]  Let me read to you the email we got, and we've vetted and done some checking and confirmed this is an accurate individual.
[02:35:46.591 --> 02:35:49.193]  We're going to use a fake name for him.
[02:35:49.193 --> 02:35:50.333]  We're going to call him David.
[02:35:50.333 --> 02:35:52.094]  This is his email to us this morning.
[02:35:52.094 --> 02:35:52.655]  Hi, fellas.
[02:35:53.355 --> 02:35:54.696]  This is to Infowars.com.
[02:35:54.696 --> 02:36:00.360]  I currently work for the TFC, the agency that manages the building maintenance, and I work on security in the complex.
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:03.002]  I think there could be a cover-up there.
[02:36:03.002 --> 02:36:06.025]  The mansion has a very large security system with infrared motion detectors.
[02:36:06.025 --> 02:36:08.166]  See, we already knew all this, but here he is confirming it.
[02:36:08.166 --> 02:36:21.416]  Around the entire yard perimeter, if anyone jumps the fence, a flat-screen monitor alerts an audible and visual alarm in the carriage house, not to mention the large fire alarm system, which is monitored at three separate locations by live officers.
[02:36:21.966 --> 02:36:24.547]  There are at least 32 cameras there alone.
[02:36:24.547 --> 02:36:26.487]  Most of them are pan, tilt, zoom.
[02:36:26.487 --> 02:36:30.508]  The guards there were probably busy watching Fox News or their TV up there.
[02:36:30.508 --> 02:36:33.429]  There's a few guards up there, the older ones, who are pretty smart.
[02:36:33.429 --> 02:36:35.450]  The younger ones ain't too bright.
[02:36:35.450 --> 02:36:40.731]  32 cams of two 46 flat screen monitors and nobody saw anything.
[02:36:40.731 --> 02:36:44.592]  They're monitoring from the little house that is there.
[02:36:44.592 --> 02:36:48.253]  It's actually pretty good size and from the governor's mansion.
[02:36:50.077 --> 02:36:57.280]  Just unbelievable, and we now go to David, who helped work on the security there.
[02:36:57.280 --> 02:36:59.261]  At great risk to himself, coming public now.
[02:36:59.261 --> 02:37:01.262]  David, thanks for coming on.
[02:37:01.262 --> 02:37:03.203]  How's it going, Alex?
[02:37:03.203 --> 02:37:09.146]  Tell us as much as you can why you think this is very suspicious and there could be a cover-up.
[02:37:09.146 --> 02:37:15.669]  Well, basically, if you drive, you know, anybody can drive around right now and
[02:37:17.438 --> 02:37:20.219]  Look at the gate that's around the mansion.
[02:37:20.219 --> 02:37:27.021]  First of all, they put up one of those large green construction gates.
[02:37:27.021 --> 02:37:32.202]  You know, first of all, you'd have to scale that, as you had said.
[02:37:32.202 --> 02:37:44.626]  And I just find it hard to believe that, you know, when I first heard about this, first thing that came to my mind was maybe something, you know, a fire, maybe dealing with all the construction going on over there.
[02:37:47.199 --> 02:37:54.361]  But, you know, hearing them ruling it, you know, an arson, and they don't have a suspect, I just find that hard to believe.
[02:37:54.361 --> 02:37:58.063]  And they're claiming they got some video of somebody walking around.
[02:37:58.063 --> 02:38:05.625]  It's probably the guy that called it in with his wife, that they're now, you know, claiming they saw on security walking around outside.
[02:38:05.625 --> 02:38:07.926]  There's people everywhere walking around.
[02:38:07.926 --> 02:38:10.027]  Let's break down the security system you've worked on.
[02:38:10.027 --> 02:38:11.387]  What is actually in there?
[02:38:11.387 --> 02:38:16.629]  These motion detectors, these infrared trip systems, these audible, audio, and visual alarms.
[02:38:17.645 --> 02:38:22.247]  You know, basically I've done contract work over there in the past.
[02:38:22.247 --> 02:38:26.828]  I mean, it's been a while since I have worked on any equipment over there.
[02:38:26.828 --> 02:38:35.871]  I do know that they were revamping all the security equipment over there, putting all the latest, you know, more high-tech equipment in there.
[02:38:35.871 --> 02:38:37.172]  Let me just add, I know what's up.
[02:38:37.172 --> 02:38:41.573]  I walked up to cameras and watched them turn and zoom in on me.
[02:38:41.573 --> 02:38:45.155]  I watched them turn in their black domes and aim at me.
[02:38:45.155 --> 02:38:45.795]  Yeah, on every
[02:38:46.525 --> 02:39:01.529]  Basically on every angle of that property there's CCTV camera and then there's also you can look around just look at you know down the street on there's like a hotel building or something right across the street and there's cameras on that building.
[02:39:01.529 --> 02:39:03.870]  Sheriff's Department?
[02:39:03.870 --> 02:39:04.430]  Is that what it is?
[02:39:04.430 --> 02:39:06.151]  Sheriff's Department?
[02:39:06.151 --> 02:39:10.092]  Did we know if Larry Silverspeed is involved in this one?
[02:39:10.092 --> 02:39:13.213]  Well yeah the Sheriff's Department is approximately
[02:39:14.116 --> 02:39:20.419]  Sixteen yards, we pasted off from the Governor's Mansion on the west side.
[02:39:20.419 --> 02:39:31.265]  Yeah, I mean back when I had put in, you know, worked on security equipment over there, there was, the cameras back then were even, you know, they were expensive high-tech cameras.
[02:39:31.265 --> 02:39:39.689]  I mean, I find it very hard to believe that somebody could have scaled the wall and lit a fire, you know, however they're claiming it happened.
[02:39:39.689 --> 02:39:40.670]  Well, here's an example.
[02:39:40.670 --> 02:39:41.350]  Here's an example.
[02:39:42.177 --> 02:39:48.130]  I have walked up to videotape it at night wanting shots of it for Endgame that people see in the film, and they come over and ask what I'm doing.
[02:39:48.695 --> 02:39:52.418]  That, uh, that, uh, another evening I decided I needed another moving shot of it.
[02:39:52.418 --> 02:39:56.421]  So we got in the, in the back of, uh, Aaron's got a Mustang with a convertible.
[02:39:56.421 --> 02:39:57.361]  I got in it.
[02:39:57.361 --> 02:40:00.984]  We drove by with a video camera, came back around, and they ran out in the street.
[02:40:00.984 --> 02:40:04.807]  State police, dangerous to themselves, jumping out in front of us.
[02:40:04.807 --> 02:40:06.127]  We almost ran over the guy.
[02:40:06.127 --> 02:40:09.790]  We were going about 20 miles an hour, and he literally just jumps out 20 feet in front of the car.
[02:40:09.790 --> 02:40:11.151]  We slam on the brakes.
[02:40:11.151 --> 02:40:12.372]  Austin cops pull up behind us.
[02:40:12.372 --> 02:40:16.575]  They start laughing when they see it's me, and drive off, because the guy was asking us if we were terrorists.
[02:40:17.222 --> 02:40:18.142]  Oh gosh, I don't know.
[02:40:18.142 --> 02:40:18.902]  I mean, every time I...
[02:40:47.276 --> 02:40:48.076]  I've been over there.
[02:40:48.076 --> 02:40:54.519]  There's been at least, you know, four or five officers there at any given time, you know, ready.
[02:40:54.519 --> 02:40:57.801]  So, I don't know.
[02:40:57.801 --> 02:40:59.982]  Seems pretty odd to me.
[02:40:59.982 --> 02:41:16.410]  Well, what about now we learn that the Austin Police Department and Fire Department say that, um, Alfonso Perez did call them and was the first to call, and the state police didn't call them until at least 15 minutes after, and the state police lied
[02:41:16.983 --> 02:41:19.584]  Yeah, I read that in the Associated Press.
[02:41:19.584 --> 02:41:21.144]  Actually, I thought that was kind of odd.
[02:41:21.144 --> 02:41:23.185]  I mean, why disclose information from the public and the media?
[02:41:23.185 --> 02:41:24.365]  I don't know why they're
[02:41:47.304 --> 02:41:50.865]  Disclose the information if you don't have anything to hide.
[02:41:50.865 --> 02:41:52.165]  I mean, that's what they tell us, right?
[02:41:52.165 --> 02:41:54.666]  If you don't have anything to hide, what are you worried about?
[02:41:54.666 --> 02:42:04.209]  It has gold-painted spikes that are pointed on an 8-foot, higher in some areas, round iron gate and fence.
[02:42:04.209 --> 02:42:07.730]  But outside that was another 8 to 10 foot, depending on which section.
[02:42:07.730 --> 02:42:11.191]  We measured it yesterday.
[02:42:11.191 --> 02:42:15.912]  Two fences, a garrison house of state police who were there 24 hours a day.
[02:42:16.562 --> 02:42:18.183]  Across the streets, the Capitol.
[02:42:18.183 --> 02:42:20.265]  Got the Sheriff's Department across the street.
[02:42:20.265 --> 02:42:22.987]  There's always cop cars parked down there at night.
[02:42:22.987 --> 02:42:24.408]  What on earth is going on here?
[02:42:24.408 --> 02:42:27.110]  I don't know who's going to benefit.
[02:42:27.110 --> 02:42:33.395]  I guess we'll find out who benefits from the whole deal, and that'll give us a little more insight on it.
[02:42:33.395 --> 02:42:37.278]  Now, tell us about the security system itself.
[02:42:37.278 --> 02:42:46.025]  I mean, basically you have outside cameras that are, you know, high-tech cameras, and you can
[02:42:46.829 --> 02:42:50.232]  Zoom in pretty, pretty, pretty far out with them.
[02:42:50.232 --> 02:43:00.679]  And, uh, I worked on the motion detection system out there, you know, and some of that equipment was up near the camera, you know, where all the camera equipment is.
[02:43:00.679 --> 02:43:04.242]  I don't want to divulge any of that information, but... Well, you can't miss it.
[02:43:04.242 --> 02:43:06.624]  Every tree out there's got cameras hanging off of it.
[02:43:06.624 --> 02:43:12.928]  Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's very obvious if anybody was to walk around there, you can clearly see the cameras.
[02:43:12.928 --> 02:43:16.171]  Well, if they're looking for a suspect, this is what's most suspicious.
[02:43:17.310 --> 02:43:20.812]  There are two trees, one about 20 yards, one about 15 yards.
[02:43:20.812 --> 02:43:22.113]  We videotaped them yesterday.
[02:43:22.113 --> 02:43:24.835]  We need to put more of this on the web.
[02:43:24.835 --> 02:43:30.258]  And one tree has four cameras in what look like boxes that are motion detectors and infrared.
[02:43:30.258 --> 02:43:31.398]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:43:31.398 --> 02:43:33.660]  They're both aimed at the front door.
[02:43:33.660 --> 02:43:36.942]  Then there's other trees with cameras, and there's the big cameras on every corner.
[02:43:36.942 --> 02:43:38.603]  There's cameras on the building.
[02:43:38.603 --> 02:43:42.225]  Why wouldn't they release the footage and say, find this person?
[02:43:42.225 --> 02:43:43.966]  I mean, again, they're acting very suspicious.
[02:43:45.054 --> 02:43:45.875]  I don't know.
[02:43:45.875 --> 02:43:53.821]  We've seen the same thing in the past with the Pentagon footage, for instance.
[02:43:53.821 --> 02:44:01.207]  I mean, why won't they show us the tape from the hotel or the gas station?
[02:44:01.207 --> 02:44:06.891]  Or all the Pentagon cameras instead of a snapshot camera.
[02:44:06.891 --> 02:44:07.992]  Yeah, three frames.
[02:44:10.234 --> 02:44:11.915]  Now tell me about this motion detector.
[02:44:11.915 --> 02:44:22.584]  Now imagine, let's say an average person like me wanted to try to scale the wall and let's say put a bag of cookies on the front porch.
[02:44:22.584 --> 02:44:29.929]  You may get about 5 feet and then you'd have some people running towards you.
[02:44:29.929 --> 02:44:31.330]  Let's put it that way.
[02:44:31.330 --> 02:44:36.594]  Yeah, so let's say I climb the 10 foot security fence.
[02:44:36.594 --> 02:44:39.837]  I climb the 8 foot spiked fence without cutting into myself.
[02:44:41.023 --> 02:45:05.898]  Uh, and then I get past all the motion detectors, uh, I put the bag of cookies, whoever this was, Molotov cocktail or whatever it was, set it on fire, or in my case, leave the bag of cookies, this is hypothetical, don't edit together please, I run back, climb back over the wrought iron spike fence, climb back over the security fence that has vinyl on it so you can't stick your feet in the fence, I climb over that and I get away, but here's the coup de grace.
[02:45:07.682 --> 02:45:10.864]  People could say, well, maybe the cameras are off, or maybe something was happening with them.
[02:45:10.864 --> 02:45:16.386]  How would whoever firebombed this know to attack right when the security system wasn't on?
[02:45:16.386 --> 02:45:17.347]  Now, they haven't said that yet.
[02:45:17.347 --> 02:45:17.907]  They won't talk.
[02:45:17.907 --> 02:45:19.548]  They're acting very suspicious.
[02:45:19.548 --> 02:45:21.269]  But let's just say it was turned off.
[02:45:21.269 --> 02:45:26.591]  How would the terrorist attack when it was off?
[02:45:26.591 --> 02:45:33.855]  I thought it, you know, why were all the artifacts in the house, in the furniture, all of that was removed, too.
[02:45:35.183 --> 02:45:37.164]  Prior to this event, too, wasn't it?
[02:45:37.164 --> 02:45:38.485]  Yeah, that's no telling, Alex.
[02:45:38.485 --> 02:45:40.166]  I mean, you know who we're dealing with these days.
[02:45:59.502 --> 02:46:00.543]  Yeah, that's what I'm worried about.
[02:46:00.543 --> 02:46:03.084]  I just hope they don't try to spin this off as some kind of, you know,
[02:46:30.465 --> 02:46:44.532]  Well, let me ask you this.
[02:46:44.532 --> 02:46:52.535]  Well, you notice they said three weeks ago they were going to convert the state police's main mission to, quote, fighting terror, which is non-existent.
[02:46:52.535 --> 02:46:57.278]  That is harassing the people, intelligence units, basically death squads.
[02:46:57.278 --> 02:46:59.519]  Some of the state police higher-ups said they didn't want to do that.
[02:46:59.519 --> 02:47:00.059]  It was stupid.
[02:47:01.010 --> 02:47:01.170]  Huh.
[02:47:01.170 --> 02:47:01.250]  Well.
[02:47:31.812 --> 02:47:37.655]  Hopefully we'll get some more real information out of here pretty soon.
[02:47:37.655 --> 02:47:39.156]  David, anything else you want to add?
[02:47:39.156 --> 02:47:41.297]  Any other points you want to make?
[02:47:41.297 --> 02:47:42.678]  I think that's about it.
[02:47:42.678 --> 02:47:52.143]  I also wanted to kind of see if we could maybe make some noise for Ron Paul and Jesse Ventura in 08.
[02:47:52.143 --> 02:47:53.524]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[02:47:53.524 --> 02:47:59.647]  Ron Paul said he's only running as a Republican, unfortunately, and Ventura will announce in the next three weeks whether he's going to run for Senate.
[02:48:00.290 --> 02:48:01.851]  But I certainly agree with you.
[02:48:01.851 --> 02:48:05.512]  Have you talked to any of your other friends that have worked on that government building?
[02:48:05.512 --> 02:48:09.874]  Is anybody else you know smelling a big, gigantic, stinking rat?
[02:48:09.874 --> 02:48:19.679]  Oh yeah, I have several buddies of mine that just, you know, everybody when they first heard the news, that was their first, you know, it just didn't seem right.
[02:48:19.679 --> 02:48:25.141]  Something didn't seem right with the whole coming out, being an arson event.
[02:48:25.141 --> 02:48:27.322]  It just seems kind of weird.
[02:48:27.913 --> 02:48:29.555]  You put those motion detectors in.
[02:48:29.555 --> 02:48:31.736]  The media is not talking about those.
[02:48:31.736 --> 02:48:33.418]  They're doing everything they can to cover this up.
[02:48:33.418 --> 02:48:42.265]  You say that within five feet of going over that fence, anywhere in the perimeter, uh, or are there any dead spots that, that, I mean, I know there's motion on the front door.
[02:48:42.265 --> 02:48:43.907]  You can see them aiming at it.
[02:48:43.907 --> 02:48:52.394]  Uh, I mean, and, and you admit, and they admit it, it's an audible alarm and a visual one in multiple, you said three, three separate
[02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:55.461]  What, in the Capitol, in the wheelhouse, and where else?
[02:48:55.461 --> 02:49:01.522]  Where else do garrisoned state police get an alarm?
[02:49:01.522 --> 02:49:14.785]  That's the DPS, I believe, has a... I mean, that's DPS that works over there, so I'm pretty sure that, you know, they have their systems in place.
[02:49:14.785 --> 02:49:21.547]  Up on Lamar Burnett at their main headquarters, we know at the wheelhouse on the governor's mansion, 50 yards from the arson attack,
[02:49:22.099 --> 02:49:25.661]  And then 200 yards away in the belly of the Capitol.
[02:49:25.661 --> 02:49:27.302]  Yep.
[02:49:27.302 --> 02:49:28.122]  I've been down there, too.
[02:49:28.122 --> 02:49:33.465]  I've had them invite me down there 10 years ago, six, seven years ago, and they were still friendly.
[02:49:33.465 --> 02:49:38.348]  Man, there's still some... Last time I was over there, there was some... They're still pretty friendly.
[02:49:38.348 --> 02:49:40.269]  They're good people, but... Oh, I know.
[02:49:40.269 --> 02:49:41.390]  All the old guys are listeners.
[02:49:41.390 --> 02:49:42.150]  They're huge fans.
[02:49:42.150 --> 02:49:44.111]  They're all listening right now, I know.
[02:49:44.111 --> 02:49:47.693]  It's just, I've said hi to the young ones, and they've said, get away from me right now!
[02:49:47.693 --> 02:49:50.515]  When we're having an event out there, and they just look at us with hatred.
[02:49:52.075 --> 02:49:53.796]  Oh, man, it's amazing.
[02:49:53.796 --> 02:49:57.877]  Well, I mean, have you seen the change in the young ones?
[02:49:57.877 --> 02:50:11.883]  Well, yeah, you can definitely tell there's some kind of new training going on with the way that they're, you know, implementing their force, I guess you could call it.
[02:50:11.883 --> 02:50:13.404]  Yeah, Conference Gone.
[02:50:13.404 --> 02:50:18.986]  Now it's, you know, guilty until, you know, beat you first and then ask questions later.
[02:50:20.618 --> 02:50:23.841]  Well, David, we really appreciate that inside report.
[02:50:23.841 --> 02:50:24.541]  There you have it.
[02:50:24.541 --> 02:50:27.644]  We'll see if the media says or does anything with this.
[02:50:27.644 --> 02:50:29.905]  All right, Betty.
[02:50:29.905 --> 02:50:31.026]  All right, thank you so much.
[02:50:31.026 --> 02:50:33.588]  I appreciate your call.
[02:50:33.588 --> 02:50:34.549]  Appreciate you joining us.
[02:50:34.549 --> 02:50:39.093]  State, let me talk to you during the break, David.
[02:50:39.093 --> 02:50:40.754]  Total stand down, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:40.754 --> 02:50:43.396]  Total stand down, as usual.
[02:50:43.396 --> 02:50:44.837]  Just absolutely disgusting.

[02:52:48.183 --> 02:52:52.006]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[02:52:52.006 --> 02:52:56.128]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[02:52:56.128 --> 02:53:02.953]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with a worse toll taken by antibiotics.
[02:53:02.953 --> 02:53:05.835]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.

[02:53:23.407 --> 02:53:29.851]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers, and more.
[02:53:29.851 --> 02:53:35.875]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with Oxysilver.
[02:53:36.235 --> 02:53:38.276]  Order your supply now by calling toll-free 1-877-817-9829.
[02:53:38.276 --> 02:53:38.837]  That's 1-877-817-9829.
[02:53:38.837 --> 02:53:39.117]  Do it now!
[02:53:39.117 --> 02:53:42.860]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side
[02:54:05.350 --> 02:54:09.572]  There's no doubt it's an inside job there at the Governor's Mansion.
[02:54:09.572 --> 02:54:11.553]  I don't know what kind of inside job.
[02:54:36.385 --> 02:54:39.287]  But it stinks so bad, there's no doubt.
[02:54:39.287 --> 02:54:40.688]  My gut tells me 100%.
[02:54:40.688 --> 02:54:44.291]  Let me give you a newsflash.
[02:54:44.291 --> 02:54:47.694]  My gut has never been wrong.
[02:54:47.694 --> 02:54:50.856]  I have just learned in the last few years past to follow my gut.
[02:54:50.856 --> 02:54:54.439]  But not just my gut, the intellectual analysis you just heard.
[02:54:54.439 --> 02:54:57.321]  Motion sensors every square inch.
[02:54:57.321 --> 02:54:58.802]  Three separate alarm systems.
[02:54:58.802 --> 02:54:59.683]  He knows a lot more.
[02:55:00.692 --> 02:55:02.594]  He's got other people inside.
[02:55:02.594 --> 02:55:04.255]  I'm not going to say anymore.
[02:55:04.255 --> 02:55:07.037]  There's a lot more that he knows that he can't say.
[02:55:07.037 --> 02:55:16.225]  A lot more he can't say.
[02:55:16.225 --> 02:55:18.046]  When you fight corruption, things get serious.
[02:55:18.046 --> 02:55:23.951]  It's like that guy that exposed selling steroids to the Dallas Cowboys and they gunned him down last week.
[02:55:23.951 --> 02:55:25.552]  We're not playing games here, folks.
[02:55:25.552 --> 02:55:26.833]  This is life and death.
[02:55:26.833 --> 02:55:28.995]  I want the police and military to hear something.
[02:55:28.995 --> 02:55:30.216]  We're the real patriots here.
[02:55:30.891 --> 02:55:34.134]  We are fighting tooth and nail to expose corruption.
[02:55:34.134 --> 02:55:40.760]  We got them burning down their own governor's mansion down the street and no doubt they'll probably produce some patsy soon.
[02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:42.802]  We have got every form of bizarreness going on.
[02:55:42.802 --> 02:55:44.283]  We've got globalists we're confronting.
[02:55:44.283 --> 02:55:46.746]  We're being followed by military intelligence.
[02:55:46.746 --> 02:55:50.950]  The government's bragging in public documents how they love staging terror attacks.
[02:55:50.950 --> 02:55:51.630]  It's admitted.
[02:55:51.630 --> 02:55:53.472]  They admit they stage events.
[02:55:53.472 --> 02:55:54.313]  Do you understand me?
[02:56:01.641 --> 02:56:03.002]  I'm doing everything I can.
[02:56:03.002 --> 02:56:04.003]  I'm putting it all on the line.
[02:56:04.003 --> 02:56:05.524]  I'm literally exhausted.
[02:56:05.524 --> 02:56:08.506]  And I'm not complaining.
[02:56:08.506 --> 02:56:11.129]  I'm just asking you to realize the time is short.
[02:56:11.129 --> 02:56:11.909]  The enemy knows that.
[02:56:11.909 --> 02:56:14.071]  They're moving against free humanity.
[02:56:14.071 --> 02:56:18.594]  And to all the people that work for this system, all the yes men, all of you, what is your problem?
[02:56:18.594 --> 02:56:21.076]  The government has lied millions of times.
[02:56:21.076 --> 02:56:24.199]  They've been caught involved in every crime you can imagine.
[02:56:24.199 --> 02:56:26.040]  Criminals run it at the top.
[02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:27.842]  Are all of you criminals within the power pyramid?
[02:56:27.842 --> 02:56:27.882]  No.
[02:56:28.809 --> 02:56:31.642]  But you're involved in criminal activity by extension.
[02:56:34.494 --> 02:56:37.696]  I'm begging you, ladies and gentlemen, to be hardcore activists every day.
[02:56:37.696 --> 02:56:40.558]  Every day, email the Google video of Endgame Out.
[02:56:40.558 --> 02:56:42.439]  Every day, make copies of the DVD.
[02:56:42.439 --> 02:56:44.540]  Buy the DVD from us to support us.
[02:56:44.540 --> 02:56:46.021]  Get Loose Change Final Cutout.
[02:56:46.021 --> 02:56:49.403]  We've got to expose the terrorists, or they're going to do more of it.
[02:56:49.403 --> 02:56:51.204]  You understand they're a real terrorist?
[02:56:51.204 --> 02:56:53.746]  You understand we're fighting them and risking our lives?
[02:56:53.746 --> 02:57:03.372]  I go to global elite meetings in Bullhornem at 25 yards away, shutting down huge conferences with royalty, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the heads of the Federal Reserve.
[02:57:06.249 --> 02:57:08.790]  You understand what we're doing?
[02:57:08.790 --> 02:57:11.430]  Every day I know I could face death.
[02:57:11.430 --> 02:57:14.911]  Every day I know I'm committed to this.
[02:57:14.911 --> 02:57:22.134]  And I just see the blind public watching MTV, watching Hulk Hogan's kid wreck a canary yellow car.
[02:57:22.134 --> 02:57:25.975]  Who cares?
[02:57:25.975 --> 02:57:32.336]  Our country is dying right now, and I need you men out there that work for the system to be manly enough to actually look into what I'm saying.
[02:57:32.336 --> 02:57:34.357]  Don't even believe me, just look into it for heaven's sake.
[02:57:35.231 --> 02:57:39.933]  I told you for over a decade our own government with Israel attacked our own ship to blame it on Egypt.
[02:57:39.933 --> 02:57:41.594]  It's now declassified.
[02:57:41.594 --> 02:57:43.675]  Major papers reported it.
[02:57:43.675 --> 02:57:46.437]  I told you Gulf of Tonkin was staged because the officers said it.
[02:57:46.437 --> 02:57:48.678]  Now it's public and admitted.
[02:57:48.678 --> 02:57:50.339]  I told you they staged terror.
[02:57:50.339 --> 02:57:53.260]  Do you understand your life means nothing to them?
[02:57:53.260 --> 02:57:54.881]  Your future means nothing to them.
[02:57:54.881 --> 02:57:58.023]  Your family's future means nothing to them.
[02:57:58.023 --> 02:58:02.485]  Even if you don't care about anybody but yourself, the average person is going to be hurt very badly by this new world order.
[02:58:03.499 --> 02:58:06.581]  Fourth hour, straight ahead, tons of calls, masses of news, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:58:06.581 --> 02:58:07.361]  Oh, God.
[02:58:07.361 --> 02:58:18.207]  It's just, we are living in just amazing times.
[02:58:18.207 --> 02:58:19.588]  Why did they burn down that building?
[02:58:19.588 --> 02:58:21.129]  Why did they do it?
[02:58:21.129 --> 02:58:23.190]  I want to hear from you on that subject as well.
[02:58:23.190 --> 02:58:29.253]  We'll be right back in 70 seconds with the fourth hour.
[02:58:29.253 --> 02:58:30.554]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.766 --> 02:58:55.588]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[02:58:55.928 --> 02:59:02.810]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.

[02:59:40.966 --> 02:59:43.348]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:43.348 --> 02:59:47.050]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:59:47.050 --> 02:59:48.171]  This is our theme.
[02:59:52.682 --> 02:59:53.422]  Gonna roll this.
[03:00:14.224 --> 03:00:29.871]  The boys are thirsty in Atlanta And there's beer in Texarkana And we'll bring it back no matter what it takes Eastbound and down, loaded up and truckin' Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[03:00:29.871 --> 03:00:36.554]  We've got a long way to go And a short time to get there I'm eastbound, just watch old bandit run
[03:00:40.635 --> 03:00:42.956]  This is our theme song in D.C.
[03:00:42.956 --> 03:00:52.959]  and Virginia with military intelligence, diplomatic security services from the State Department following us, trying to set us up.
[03:00:52.959 --> 03:00:54.420]  We just cranked it up.
[03:00:54.420 --> 03:00:56.480]  We had a lot of fun fighting that tyranny.
[03:00:56.480 --> 03:00:58.881]  Crank it back up!
[03:00:58.881 --> 03:00:59.401]  Ha ha!
[03:00:59.401 --> 03:00:59.701]  Yeehaw!
[03:00:59.701 --> 03:01:00.261]  I love it!
[03:01:00.261 --> 03:01:03.443]  We're having fun fighting for this republic.
[03:01:03.443 --> 03:01:04.303]  We're the real Americans.
[03:01:04.303 --> 03:01:07.644]  Don't let it be said that we didn't stand up, we didn't fight.
[03:01:10.666 --> 03:01:14.890]  Don't let it be said that we didn't have fun doing it, while we even risked our lives.
[03:01:14.890 --> 03:01:18.293]  Richard Reeves did a great job, Rob Jacobson, Aaron Dyches, and myself.
[03:01:18.293 --> 03:01:22.036]  That was my team, and I salute ya, and this song is for you.
[03:01:22.036 --> 03:01:23.998]  Old Smokey's got his ears on.
[03:01:27.688 --> 03:01:29.949]  He's got his ears on, he's hot on your trail.
[03:01:29.949 --> 03:01:32.530]  He's not gonna rest until you're in jail.
[03:01:32.530 --> 03:01:34.951]  It's us or them.
[03:01:34.951 --> 03:01:38.373]  We gotta beat the new world order, gotta do it now!
[03:01:38.373 --> 03:01:40.994]  Here it is!
[03:01:40.994 --> 03:01:48.217]  And he's hot on your trail, and he ain't gonna rest until you're in jail.
[03:01:48.217 --> 03:01:52.519]  So you've got to dodge him, you've got to duck him, you've got to keep that diesel truckin'.
[03:01:52.519 --> 03:01:55.380]  Just put that hammer down and give it hell.
[03:01:56.903 --> 03:01:59.424]  I'll tell ya, it says it all.
[03:01:59.424 --> 03:02:01.306]  Run it back about a minute.
[03:02:01.306 --> 03:02:03.987]  I want them to hear that part.
[03:02:03.987 --> 03:02:07.269]  Where they say, uh... Old Smokey's got his ears on.
[03:02:07.269 --> 03:02:11.331]  Right by the National Reconnaissance Center.
[03:02:27.347 --> 03:02:30.668]  Yeah, Old Smokey had his ears on us and everything we were saying and doing.
[03:02:30.668 --> 03:02:33.328]  But we beat him.
[03:02:33.328 --> 03:02:35.409]  We took over that Bilderberg group meeting.
[03:02:35.409 --> 03:02:38.249]  We shut down one of their conferences, bullhorning it.
[03:02:38.249 --> 03:02:39.810]  Point Blank Range.
[03:02:39.810 --> 03:02:42.210]  Right up there in front of the Dragon.
[03:02:42.210 --> 03:02:44.991]  Punching him right in the nose.
[03:02:44.991 --> 03:02:45.571]  We did it!
[03:02:45.571 --> 03:02:47.291]  The spirit of America!
[03:02:47.291 --> 03:02:48.232]  Yeah!
[03:02:48.232 --> 03:02:50.012]  Old Smokey's got them ears on.
[03:02:50.012 --> 03:02:51.912]  He's right on your trail.
[03:02:51.912 --> 03:02:54.573]  And he ain't gonna rest until you're in jail.
[03:02:55.766 --> 03:03:00.087]  So you've got to duck him, you've got to dodge him, you've got to keep that diesel truckin'.
[03:03:00.087 --> 03:03:04.368]  Just put that hammer down and give him hell.
[03:03:04.368 --> 03:03:07.129]  He's bound to die, loaded up man truckin'.
[03:03:07.129 --> 03:03:08.449]  A little victory song for the boys.
[03:03:08.449 --> 03:03:10.810]  We're gonna do what they say can't be done.
[03:03:10.810 --> 03:03:13.891]  We've got a long way to go.
[03:03:13.891 --> 03:03:16.292]  And it's sure time to get there.
[03:03:16.292 --> 03:03:18.032]  Just watch the bandit run.
[03:03:18.032 --> 03:03:23.954]  The real Americans defending the Republic.
[03:03:25.444 --> 03:03:28.606]  The American people, I salute you.
[03:03:28.606 --> 03:03:31.708]  Everybody that came out there to confront the Bilderberg group.
[03:03:31.708 --> 03:03:35.071]  Everybody that was there, I just absolutely love you to death.
[03:03:35.071 --> 03:03:39.594]  We're going to come back, take calls from Billy John, Deleon, Corey, Chris and others.
[03:03:39.594 --> 03:03:41.716]  Then I'm going to recap what happened the last three days.
[03:03:41.716 --> 03:03:44.297]  I've covered yesterday, the first couple days of Bilderberg.
[03:03:44.297 --> 03:03:47.920]  I want to cover it all and recap it all and then cover some more news.
[03:03:47.920 --> 03:03:50.722]  When we get back, we will take your calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:03:51.750 --> 03:03:58.534]  Old Smokey's got his ears on, and he's hot on your trail, and he ain't gonna rest till you're in jail.
[03:03:58.534 --> 03:04:02.797]  So you got to duck him, you got to dodge him, you got to keep that diesel truckin'.
[03:04:02.797 --> 03:04:06.239]  Just let that hammer down and give him hell.
[03:04:06.239 --> 03:04:07.759]  I love it!
[03:04:07.759 --> 03:04:11.141]  We're having fun all the way, folks, even if it's to the gallows.
[03:04:11.141 --> 03:04:11.882]  We're committed.
[03:04:11.882 --> 03:04:13.903]  It feels good to be on the side of right.
[03:04:13.903 --> 03:04:15.564]  It feels good to not be afraid.
[03:04:15.564 --> 03:04:16.965]  It feels good to take action.
[03:04:18.351 --> 03:04:21.492]  You know what we even know it's a victory when you call up threatening our families.
[03:04:21.492 --> 03:04:26.533]  It lets us know we're on the right side, lets us know you're the trash, and lets us know we got to you.
[03:04:26.533 --> 03:04:28.133]  Lets us know our lives mean something.
[03:04:28.133 --> 03:04:31.594]  It ain't about a bunch of ball games and acting silly and screwing around.
[03:04:31.594 --> 03:04:38.696]  It's about living for decency and honor and freedom and fighting these generational interests that think that we're their slaves.
[03:04:38.696 --> 03:04:39.736]  We will never surrender.
[03:04:39.736 --> 03:04:42.377]  We'll be right back after this quick break with your calls and a lot more.
[03:04:47.552 --> 03:04:49.873]  Once, America was led by real politicians.
[03:04:49.873 --> 03:04:54.954]  Now politicians in the U.S., city, county, state, and federal are owned and controlled by corporations.
[03:04:54.954 --> 03:04:57.655]  We have corporate representatives instead of politicians.
[03:04:57.655 --> 03:05:01.936]  Criminal corporate manipulation has caused grain prices to soar to the highest levels in history.
[03:05:01.936 --> 03:05:04.977]  Shortages of rice, corn, and wheat now exist in most countries.
[03:05:04.977 --> 03:05:08.318]  Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation.

[03:05:46.620 --> 03:05:50.222]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:05:50.222 --> 03:05:52.583]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:05:52.583 --> 03:05:55.724]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:05:55.724 --> 03:06:01.467]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[03:06:01.467 --> 03:06:05.369]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[03:06:47.842 --> 03:06:53.363]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:06:53.363 --> 03:06:58.705]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.

[03:07:00.565 --> 03:07:09.888]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[03:07:54.426 --> 03:07:56.906]  This is for Bob Chatman popping in for 10 minutes with us.
[03:07:56.906 --> 03:07:58.767]  He's another rebel for liberty.
[03:07:58.767 --> 03:08:04.268]  And then we're gonna be taking your calls, getting into Bilderberg.
[03:08:04.268 --> 03:08:06.048]  We'll do this for a full hour tomorrow.
[03:08:06.048 --> 03:08:09.289]  With all that's happening with the economy.
[03:08:09.289 --> 03:08:11.089]  And the globalists are the enemies.
[03:08:11.089 --> 03:08:13.149]  All we gotta do is expose that they're the enemy.
[03:08:13.149 --> 03:08:16.410]  Here it is.
[03:08:16.410 --> 03:08:18.370]  And he's hot on your trail.
[03:08:18.370 --> 03:08:20.651]  And he ain't gonna rest till you're in jail.
[03:08:21.681 --> 03:08:26.125]  So you got to dodge them, you got to duck them, you got to keep that diesel trucking.
[03:08:26.125 --> 03:08:30.328]  And give them hell!
[03:08:30.328 --> 03:08:32.329]  You gotta love it!
[03:08:32.329 --> 03:08:39.295]  Now you should have seen us being chased by military police, followed, guys in clown masks following us.
[03:08:39.295 --> 03:08:47.101]  We would just crank this up and laugh at them and get video of their faces and they'd swerve off and do everything else they did.
[03:08:48.320 --> 03:08:49.582]  Yeah!
[03:08:49.582 --> 03:08:51.123]  Got to duck them, we got to dodge them.
[03:08:51.123 --> 03:08:54.387]  We got to keep that diesel trucking.
[03:08:54.387 --> 03:08:56.469]  We're going to beat you.
[03:08:56.469 --> 03:09:02.196]  You know, a man in the wrong can't stand against a man in the right who keeps on a coming.
[03:09:02.196 --> 03:09:03.377]  We're just going to keep on a coming.
[03:09:03.377 --> 03:09:06.361]  You heard about Mark Dice, Fox News freaking out over it.
[03:09:07.206 --> 03:09:09.448]  Just a great idea we hadn't thought of.
[03:09:09.448 --> 03:09:10.349]  And this is what it takes.
[03:09:10.349 --> 03:09:12.211]  Great minds thinking together.
[03:09:12.211 --> 03:09:13.572]  All of us together.
[03:09:13.572 --> 03:09:21.659]  Send DVDs like Terror Storm and others in his press release out to the people in the military in Iraq.
[03:09:21.659 --> 03:09:23.441]  I'll go on to Bob Chapman for a quick report today.
[03:09:23.441 --> 03:09:27.304]  I'll get a full hour with him tomorrow because so much is happening economically.
[03:09:27.304 --> 03:09:29.105]  Bob, to me it is absolutely essential.
[03:09:29.105 --> 03:09:30.287]  I want your take on this.
[03:09:30.287 --> 03:09:31.588]  InternationalForecaster.com.
[03:09:32.652 --> 03:09:34.594]  It's essential to expose that they're the terrorists.
[03:09:34.594 --> 03:09:47.007]  It's essential to expose that they're, by their own IMF documents, World Bank documents, imploding the economy by design, destroying the dollar by design, because then they can't pose with the next part of their phase.
[03:09:47.007 --> 03:09:53.893]  We said eight months ago, when this newest crisis started, they would propose a global law, a global government, with global banks running it.
[03:09:53.893 --> 03:09:56.396]  They say, we'll buy our carbon credits from the private banks.
[03:09:56.676 --> 03:09:57.597]  Well, that's correct.
[03:09:57.597 --> 03:10:00.398]  And they are doing behind the scenes what they call harmonization.
[03:10:26.181 --> 03:10:34.886]  And that is within industry and cross-border harmonization within industry with rules and things like that.
[03:10:34.886 --> 03:10:37.427]  And the people don't know what they're doing.
[03:10:37.427 --> 03:10:46.392]  And when they want to finally make a change, like that's what they're doing with the North American Union, all of a sudden all the groundwork's been laid.
[03:10:46.392 --> 03:10:52.876]  Nobody knew about it, but they've been working on it because they got the time and money and staff to do so.
[03:10:52.876 --> 03:10:54.877]  And that's a very important part of it.
[03:10:55.533 --> 03:11:06.639]  The second thing is to bring Europe, the United States, and Canada, among the wealthiest nations in the world, to these economically.
[03:11:06.639 --> 03:11:12.122]  And the reason for that is to force them to accept world government.
[03:11:12.122 --> 03:11:22.587]  And part of that is the first nationalization of banking, the financial world in general, insurance,
[03:11:23.659 --> 03:11:28.141]  And they're in the process of doing that in the United States right now.
[03:11:28.141 --> 03:11:35.623]  And the European Central Bank, at least among those in the Eurozone, is doing the same thing.
[03:11:35.623 --> 03:11:45.447]  And if you notice, they had the Lisbon Agreement, which everybody in Europe disagrees with, for the most part, on balance, I should say.
[03:11:45.447 --> 03:11:50.769]  And there's lawsuits against it, but this shows you the extent that they will go to
[03:11:51.556 --> 03:11:53.057]  To get what they want.
[03:11:53.057 --> 03:12:01.142]  What that Lisbon Agreement was, is to have a constitution and call it by another name.
[03:12:01.142 --> 03:12:03.744]  That other name was Agreement.
[03:12:03.744 --> 03:12:09.467]  And the people in France, and in Holland both, had voted that agreement down.
[03:12:09.467 --> 03:12:13.410]  So those are the kind of things that they're doing behind the scenes to break things down.
[03:12:13.410 --> 03:12:15.551]  Let me add, I'm going to get your take on this, Bob.
[03:12:15.551 --> 03:12:17.112]  Finish up, go ahead, sorry.
[03:12:17.112 --> 03:12:18.052]  That's okay.
[03:12:18.052 --> 03:12:18.873]  No, you were finishing up.
[03:12:18.873 --> 03:12:19.513]  I talked to everybody.
[03:12:19.513 --> 03:12:20.554]  You said, to do what?
[03:12:24.482 --> 03:12:27.364]  These are the kinds of things that they're doing.
[03:12:27.364 --> 03:12:31.326]  Some of the things you see, other things you don't see.
[03:12:31.326 --> 03:12:33.588]  Harmonization, you don't see.
[03:12:33.588 --> 03:12:39.272]  Nationalization of the banks, you don't realize what they're doing until it's been done.
[03:12:39.272 --> 03:12:44.215]  And then the internationalization of banks.
[03:12:44.215 --> 03:12:49.979]  And when all is said and done down the line, as Brzezinski says, like 30 years from now,
[03:12:50.478 --> 03:12:57.119]  Because our program has been all messed up and that's how long it's going to take now.
[03:12:57.119 --> 03:13:05.221]  What they'll have to do is internationalize these banks so that you've got a handful of banks to go to.
[03:13:05.221 --> 03:13:12.083]  And if you are outspoken about what's going on, they cancel your bank account.
[03:13:12.083 --> 03:13:18.924]  And incidentally, in England, they're doing that with people now who work with Iranian
[03:13:20.970 --> 03:13:22.612]  And that's a very dangerous trend.
[03:13:22.612 --> 03:13:24.353]  I want to talk more about that.
[03:13:24.353 --> 03:13:29.518]  We know Bush signed an executive order about eight months ago, nine months ago, saying that
[03:13:43.673 --> 03:13:53.116]  Anybody, even retroactively, who is in business with any company or group retroactively that they claim ever dealt with any terrorist group, they're going to seize all your assets.
[03:13:53.116 --> 03:13:58.697]  So, a great new Admiralty-type letter of marque system coming in.
[03:13:58.697 --> 03:14:04.319]  Meanwhile, Halliburton helped give nuclear components, admittedly BBC, to Pakistan and Iran.
[03:14:04.319 --> 03:14:06.539]  They're total sickening hypocrites.
[03:14:06.539 --> 03:14:09.240]  But I wanted to bring up what Dr. Jerome Courtsey brought up,
[03:14:09.984 --> 03:14:23.210]  Uh, in the last hour, and that is that the Securities Exchange Commission and the Commerce Department have announced that for over a hundred years they have shown statistics on foreign company ownership and buy-ups and overseeing, and the government would not allow a lot of that.
[03:14:23.210 --> 03:14:24.711]  It was seen against our interest.
[03:14:24.711 --> 03:14:31.453]  Now they will no longer review any foreign buying or takeover, and they will keep that secret from the public.
[03:14:31.453 --> 03:14:39.397]  So here's all our info as citizens public, but then foreign corporations coming in as the dollar plunges and buying everything up, that's going to be secret.
[03:14:40.894 --> 03:14:42.975]  Yes, and I think it goes beyond that.
[03:14:42.975 --> 03:14:50.800]  Incidentally, Jerome Corsi is a wonderful researcher, and he does a wonderful job.
[03:14:50.800 --> 03:15:02.207]  And we carry his articles just like we carry yours in a prominent place in our publication, you know, to link to what other people are having to say.
[03:15:02.207 --> 03:15:04.388]  So I don't have to write about it.
[03:15:04.388 --> 03:15:06.950]  But anyway, I think it goes further than that.
[03:15:08.128 --> 03:15:17.712]  I think one of the reasons that the government has been taking over so much land and things like that... Collateral.
[03:15:17.712 --> 03:15:22.334]  ...you know, federal land, is I think they've got it up as collateral.
[03:15:22.334 --> 03:15:23.975]  And I'm just guessing.
[03:15:23.975 --> 03:15:25.475]  I think they've got it up as collateral.
[03:15:25.475 --> 03:15:28.477]  Well, that's actually in the IMF World Bank documents, Bob.
[03:15:28.477 --> 03:15:30.097]  What's that?
[03:15:30.097 --> 03:15:36.620]  That's in the Joseph Stiglitz-leaked November 2000 IMF World Bank documents.
[03:15:37.864 --> 03:15:39.365]  I haven't seen that.
[03:15:39.365 --> 03:15:44.147]  Well, your analysis is correct.
[03:15:44.147 --> 03:15:48.830]  I try to think of what they're going to do before they do it, or while they're doing it.
[03:15:48.830 --> 03:15:53.832]  Well, obviously, I'm eight years behind on this one, but my insight, I guess, was there.
[03:15:53.832 --> 03:15:55.273]  You're six.
[03:15:55.273 --> 03:15:55.733]  You're six.
[03:15:55.733 --> 03:15:55.933]  It was 2002.
[03:15:55.933 --> 03:15:57.954]  Well, no, I mean, who can know everything?
[03:15:57.954 --> 03:15:59.255]  You know more than I do about economics.
[03:15:59.255 --> 03:16:01.336]  We're all scanning, and I interview all the experts.
[03:16:02.765 --> 03:16:04.767]  In the four minutes we've got left, you'll be with us a full hour.
[03:16:04.767 --> 03:16:06.848]  In the second hour tomorrow, everybody should tune in for that.
[03:16:06.848 --> 03:16:10.011]  Whereas we give a whole overview on how to protect yourselves and more.
[03:16:10.011 --> 03:16:11.672]  Right now, oil exploding.
[03:16:11.672 --> 03:16:12.773]  They're trying to suppress gold.
[03:16:12.773 --> 03:16:16.195]  It was up to 900 and something last week, down this week.
[03:16:16.195 --> 03:16:18.297]  What do you see happening?
[03:16:18.297 --> 03:16:24.702]  Well, they will continue to try to take gold down, but it'll keep right on coming back, along with silver.
[03:16:24.702 --> 03:16:31.387]  And as far as oil is concerned, it's a hard call, because it's pretty expensive at this point.
[03:16:32.465 --> 03:16:38.230]  I think a fair price for oil right now is probably around $80 a barrel.
[03:16:38.230 --> 03:16:41.933]  It could, in time, go back to $50, but not around now.
[03:16:41.933 --> 03:16:51.301]  I think perhaps we might trade here somewhere between $100 and $140 a barrel.
[03:16:51.301 --> 03:16:59.428]  The main problem with all of the commodities, or anything that trades in dollars, is the depreciating dollar.
[03:17:00.842 --> 03:17:11.584]  They come out in Jawbone, Paulson, and Bernanke yesterday and today, again, about the dollars of the dollar rallies, but it can't hold a rally.
[03:17:11.584 --> 03:17:14.325]  It isn't going anywhere to the upside.
[03:17:14.325 --> 03:17:21.106]  And so, you're going to have continued pressure on everything that's dollar-related.
[03:17:21.106 --> 03:17:25.727]  And oil is one of those things, except for Iran, selling oil.
[03:17:25.727 --> 03:17:27.468]  Everybody else sells it in dollars.
[03:17:29.688 --> 03:17:43.196]  And then you've got people in Israel and people in Washington, particularly our President, telling everybody almost every day that they're going to invade next week, or the week after, or the week after that.
[03:17:43.196 --> 03:17:47.639]  Now, people don't know what's going to happen, and the wall will leak.
[03:17:48.191 --> 03:17:49.652]  Will the Persians go?
[03:17:49.652 --> 03:17:52.615]  Will the Straits be shut down?
[03:17:52.615 --> 03:17:55.817]  They're clearly doing things to destabilize.
[03:17:55.817 --> 03:18:09.048]  So you're saying they're clearly trying to destabilize at a bare minimum to create instability in the dollar and make people speculate and drive up all of the raw materials, the commodities that are out there.
[03:18:09.048 --> 03:18:12.150]  So they're by design destabilizing.
[03:18:12.150 --> 03:18:13.992]  Well, you know, you've got to think of it this way.
[03:18:14.480 --> 03:18:22.904]  Why would Israel and our administration run around so frequently telling people that they're going to bomb Iran?
[03:18:22.904 --> 03:18:26.985]  I mean, it's just over and over and over again.
[03:18:26.985 --> 03:18:42.332]  And all that does is make the price of oil and other things go up in addition to the inflation that's being caused by a dollar, which is, well, not what the paper it's written on, essentially.
[03:18:43.341 --> 03:18:48.303]  And so they're exacerbating the problem is what they're doing.
[03:18:48.303 --> 03:18:49.884]  Do you still have... You're right.
[03:18:49.884 --> 03:18:51.484]  And you say, why would they do that?
[03:18:51.484 --> 03:18:53.785]  Well, maybe they want higher prices.
[03:18:53.785 --> 03:18:54.545]  Why?
[03:18:54.545 --> 03:19:00.027]  Because it puts people in a position where they'll have to take what's given to them.
[03:19:00.027 --> 03:19:09.371]  In other words, governmental control comes from the inability to be able to buy food and energy at reasonable prices.

[03:20:49.553 --> 03:20:54.418]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:20:54.418 --> 03:20:57.260]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:20:57.260 --> 03:20:59.423]  Put their objective being world domination.
[03:21:00.046 --> 03:21:03.208]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[03:21:03.208 --> 03:21:13.573]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.

[03:21:26.600 --> 03:21:27.401]  They're not after money.

[03:21:46.528 --> 03:21:52.809]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.

[03:21:56.990 --> 03:21:58.930]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[03:21:58.930 --> 03:22:01.351]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[03:22:01.351 --> 03:22:07.692]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets

[03:24:24.528 --> 03:24:46.622]  The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become?
[03:24:46.622 --> 03:24:48.624]  My sweetest friend
[03:24:51.406 --> 03:25:01.591]  Everyone I know goes away in the end.
[03:25:01.591 --> 03:25:09.635]  And you could have it all, my empire of dirt.
[03:25:32.991 --> 03:25:43.854]  I wear this crown of thorns upon my liar's chair.
[03:25:43.854 --> 03:25:54.117]  Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair.
[03:25:54.117 --> 03:25:57.598]  Beneath the stains of time
[03:25:59.994 --> 03:26:19.240]  All right, it's hard to cut Johnny Cash off.
[03:26:19.240 --> 03:26:22.622]  Let's go to Billy in New Jersey.
[03:26:22.622 --> 03:26:23.502]  You're on the air, Billy.
[03:26:23.502 --> 03:26:23.822]  Welcome.
[03:26:25.083 --> 03:26:27.704]  Hi Alex, my voice sounds different today.
[03:26:27.704 --> 03:26:30.185]  I have laryngitis, but we spoke several times.
[03:26:30.185 --> 03:26:32.566]  I haven't talked to you since like February.
[03:26:32.566 --> 03:26:42.790]  One of the things I wanted to talk about actually is I have two articles I've written, which I think came out really well, and I'm just curious if you could publish them on your website.
[03:26:42.790 --> 03:26:43.970]  Yeah, send them by to us.
[03:26:43.970 --> 03:26:48.732]  Aaron was up here at like four in the morning, so he's not in right now, but send them to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[03:26:48.732 --> 03:26:50.072]  Send them to Kurt.
[03:26:50.072 --> 03:26:51.873]  What's Kurt's web address?
[03:26:51.873 --> 03:26:52.533]  Oh, he's got his own.
[03:26:52.533 --> 03:26:54.394]  We need to get him an InfoWars address, so I can give that out.
[03:26:56.201 --> 03:27:00.182]  Okay, well, before the call in, could you tell me the email addresses?
[03:27:00.182 --> 03:27:05.883]  And the reason I wanted to have them on your website is because there are two major stories.
[03:27:05.883 --> 03:27:14.564]  One is about fluoride, and the other one is about the dropout rate, and how basically no child left behind is actually hurting the country.
[03:27:14.564 --> 03:27:16.285]  Well, it's designed to do that.
[03:27:16.285 --> 03:27:16.985]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:27:16.985 --> 03:27:18.265]  That's basically what it was about.
[03:27:18.265 --> 03:27:21.886]  And it was, like, really good, especially for it to be written by someone my age.
[03:27:21.886 --> 03:27:23.906]  And it was supposed to actually be the cover of
[03:27:25.205 --> 03:27:27.646]  The school newspaper, and my school is like really huge.
[03:27:27.646 --> 03:27:29.408]  It has like 2,000 students or more.
[03:27:29.408 --> 03:27:30.728]  It's really big.
[03:27:30.728 --> 03:27:35.591]  And it was supposed to be the cover, and it was conveniently dropped last minute.
[03:27:35.591 --> 03:27:38.493]  Well, be sure and write that in what you send us, and it's good stuff.
[03:27:38.493 --> 03:27:41.535]  I mean, we had to scan over it, but we might post it up there.
[03:27:41.535 --> 03:27:42.715]  I appreciate you doing that.
[03:27:42.715 --> 03:27:44.817]  Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[03:27:44.817 --> 03:27:46.057]  Two A's.
[03:27:46.057 --> 03:27:50.140]  Make sure you tell the story above it, because he might not even be in today by the time I leave.
[03:27:50.140 --> 03:27:53.682]  But out of town, so I'm only going to work until 4 o'clock today or so, because I'm
[03:27:54.209 --> 03:27:55.609]  I just got a chance to see my family.
[03:27:55.609 --> 03:27:57.910]  My show was on Coast to Coast again last night.
[03:27:57.910 --> 03:28:00.010]  But we'll do that, Billy.
[03:28:00.010 --> 03:28:02.771]  Anything else?
[03:28:02.771 --> 03:28:06.972]  Yeah, well, I'll tell you what they were about in the thing, but the same thing happened with my fluoride one.
[03:28:06.972 --> 03:28:11.253]  That was supposed to be the main feature in the paper, too, and it was voted on to be it.
[03:28:11.253 --> 03:28:14.594]  But the one day it was absent, it was conveniently dropped, too.
[03:28:14.594 --> 03:28:23.856]  So I'm just saying, anyone out there who wants to get their shoes out, you really have to be on your stuff, nonstop, because people will try to really
[03:28:24.822 --> 03:28:26.744]  Um, try to hide it from you.
[03:28:26.744 --> 03:28:29.906]  Even, like, the school principals and everything, which just surprised me.
[03:28:29.906 --> 03:28:37.732]  Yeah, well, they think they're protecting their job by protecting the establishment, and all they're doing is helping the New World Order kill them and their family with eugenics.
[03:28:37.732 --> 03:28:44.577]  It's the saddest thing to see these compartmentalized fools defending a completely bankrupt evil system, but they're gonna find out.
[03:28:44.577 --> 03:28:53.864]  And about school, um, about college, like, um, I've been hearing, like, good and bad sides to this, but the school I'm taking is, you know, Berkeley College of Music?
[03:28:53.864 --> 03:28:54.044]  Yeah.
[03:28:54.915 --> 03:29:02.378]  Okay, I'm taking that online, though, and I've, um, people have been telling me, oh, there are, like, more downsides to take him, like, in school.
[03:29:02.378 --> 03:29:11.501]  The reason I didn't want to take him in school is because of all the shootings that have been going on recently, and, um, I just want to hear your take about taking college online.
[03:29:11.501 --> 03:29:12.621]  Like, what do you think about that?
[03:29:12.621 --> 03:29:14.182]  Like, I don't know.
[03:29:14.182 --> 03:29:17.263]  I think either there was a better period to take it online because it won't happen again.
[03:29:17.263 --> 03:29:17.483]  I hear you.
[03:29:17.483 --> 03:29:23.705]  Let me briefly, on the other side, and I appreciate your call, Billy, let me briefly, um, come back and
[03:29:24.542 --> 03:29:29.605]  Tell you what I think about college, and we'll get to all your other calls, 1-800-259-9231.

[03:29:45.080 --> 03:29:52.084]  Hi neighbor, no matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[03:29:52.084 --> 03:29:58.587]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[03:29:58.587 --> 03:30:02.489]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[03:30:02.489 --> 03:30:05.711]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[03:30:06.371 --> 03:30:10.354]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[03:30:10.354 --> 03:30:15.578]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[03:30:15.578 --> 03:30:18.219]  We will still have two regrets.
[03:30:18.219 --> 03:30:22.242]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[03:30:22.242 --> 03:30:25.905]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[03:30:25.905 --> 03:30:32.730]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.

[03:32:45.456 --> 03:32:46.497]  Federal agents!
[03:32:46.497 --> 03:32:48.318]  We are armed!
[03:33:09.475 --> 03:33:12.578]  I got a message to the government, like every day.
[03:33:12.578 --> 03:33:18.084]  I watch, look, and call them all suckers.
[03:33:18.084 --> 03:33:19.986]  You wanted me about Osama over there?
[03:33:28.015 --> 03:33:32.336]  I see a message from the government, like every day.
[03:33:32.336 --> 03:33:35.197]  I watch it and listen, and call them all suckers.
[03:33:35.197 --> 03:33:37.517]  They're warning me about Osama or whatever.
[03:33:37.517 --> 03:33:39.217]  Picture me buying this scam.
[03:33:39.217 --> 03:33:40.438]  I said, never.
[03:33:40.438 --> 03:33:43.078]  You in tune to a hard truth soldier spitting.
[03:33:43.078 --> 03:33:45.699]  I stay committed, give a s*** if I lose commission.
[03:33:45.699 --> 03:33:48.339]  It's all a part of fighting devil state mind control.
[03:33:48.339 --> 03:33:50.900]  And all about the battle for your body, mind and soul.
[03:33:50.900 --> 03:33:53.661]  And now I'm hoping you don't close your mind so they shape you.
[03:33:53.661 --> 03:33:55.941]  Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us AIDS and raped us.
[03:33:56.141 --> 03:34:00.043]  This just in, Epoch Times, one of the biggest alternative newspapers in the world.
[03:34:00.043 --> 03:34:01.283]  I've been in London.
[03:34:01.283 --> 03:34:02.504]  I've been in Southern Mexico.
[03:34:02.504 --> 03:34:03.744]  I've been in Canada.
[03:34:24.890 --> 03:34:31.634]  I have seen it all over the world from Tokyo to London to Brasilia.
[03:34:31.634 --> 03:34:38.518]  They are in hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of major cities all over the place.
[03:34:38.518 --> 03:34:40.760]  All over New York, all over DC.
[03:34:40.760 --> 03:34:45.042]  In the hotels you see their free newspaper.
[03:34:45.042 --> 03:34:47.164]  It is predominantly a Falun Gong newspaper.
[03:34:47.164 --> 03:34:49.685]  Great folks, anti-tyranny.
[03:34:49.685 --> 03:34:54.288]  And they did a, this is the only what you could call mainstream print publication
[03:34:55.740 --> 03:34:58.963]  In the United States, that is put on newsstands everywhere.
[03:34:58.963 --> 03:35:01.826]  And they're in major cities, over about a million people.
[03:35:01.826 --> 03:35:09.293]  I've even seen some Epoch Times here and there in Austin, but not like it's saturated in... in capital cities.
[03:35:09.293 --> 03:35:15.178]  So, that is up on InfoWars.com by Don Wong Kang.
[03:35:15.178 --> 03:35:18.521]  Duong Kang.
[03:35:18.521 --> 03:35:20.083]  He was a nice fellow, talked to him for about 30 minutes.
[03:35:22.688 --> 03:35:25.750]  Headline, Epoch Times interview Alex Jones at Bilderberg.
[03:35:25.750 --> 03:35:28.192]  I'm going to click on the actual link and see what their headline was.
[03:35:28.192 --> 03:35:32.055]  I'm going to go to the Epoch Times and cover this.
[03:35:32.055 --> 03:35:34.357]  Mainstream media blackout Bilderberg meeting.
[03:35:34.357 --> 03:35:35.738]  Wow, what a good headline.
[03:35:35.738 --> 03:35:45.125]  While over 100 of the most influential people in the world are believed to gather at the Westfields Marriott Hotel in Chantilly, Virginia for several days, all the major media except for the Epoch Times are apparently silent about it.
[03:35:45.125 --> 03:35:48.067]  This event is an annual gathering of the Bilderberg group.
[03:35:48.067 --> 03:35:49.208]  Let's punch that up on screen.
[03:35:49.788 --> 03:36:00.456]  Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Chairman of the Federal Reserve in Bernanke, Henry Kissinger, Vernon Jordan, and others were seen by witnesses, and some of them were confirmed by others just outside the hotel.
[03:36:00.456 --> 03:36:12.684]  Photos and videotapes were taken of them, seen websites operated by Alex Jones, the bottom of this report, and have been posted by some of the videos and photos.
[03:36:12.684 --> 03:36:17.928]  And it goes on to say, Alex Jones, syndicated radio talk show host and documentary filmmaker, says that he
[03:36:19.592 --> 03:36:29.516]  invited the Washington Post, the Fairfax Times, and asked 16 million listeners of Coast to Coast AM radio show to call on the press to cover the event, but no major media showed.
[03:36:29.516 --> 03:36:30.596]  This is a criminal group.
[03:36:30.596 --> 03:36:33.977]  They are involved in very bad things, said Alex Jones, referring to the Bilderberg Group.
[03:36:33.977 --> 03:36:35.618]  He said they violate the Logan Act.
[03:36:35.618 --> 03:36:42.140]  The federal law says that they can't come here and discuss policy with private interest and secret because we have a right to know.
[03:36:42.140 --> 03:36:46.982]  The only place they can discuss these things in secret is in a national security meeting in the Congress of the Capitol.
[03:36:47.689 --> 03:36:49.692]  And that's amongst themselves.
[03:36:49.692 --> 03:36:51.875]  This is illegal what they are doing.
[03:36:51.875 --> 03:36:57.423]  That's why we have moles inside reporting to us what's happening.
[03:36:57.423 --> 03:36:59.866]  Man, this is just real reporting here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:36:59.866 --> 03:37:02.169]  Everything he's saying is documented, by the way, by quoting me.
[03:37:02.169 --> 03:37:02.670]  It's all proven.
[03:37:03.402 --> 03:37:12.307]  He continued, this isn't about the federal government, this is about private interest meeting with members of the government outside of the government, violating federal law in the Logan Act.
[03:37:12.307 --> 03:37:14.428]  We are here because this is a criminal summit.
[03:37:14.428 --> 03:37:15.168]  These are globalists.
[03:37:15.168 --> 03:37:16.349]  They want one world government.
[03:37:16.349 --> 03:37:17.810]  They want to reduce liberty.
[03:37:17.810 --> 03:37:23.233]  Alex Jones is also the producer of Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:37:23.233 --> 03:37:27.075]  When asked about evidence of Bilderberg Group's influence over US presidential candidates, he said,
[03:37:28.058 --> 03:37:31.940]  From our sources, they decide who they like best, and then they put their weight behind them.
[03:37:31.940 --> 03:37:37.984]  These people own the media, they own the big corporations, they've got trillions of dollars together.
[03:37:37.984 --> 03:37:43.528]  And they get the nod from the big boys, you tend to get the support.
[03:37:43.528 --> 03:37:45.069]  Do they have total control over society?
[03:37:45.069 --> 03:37:45.249]  No.
[03:37:45.249 --> 03:37:46.970]  Do they have total control over the candidates?
[03:37:46.970 --> 03:37:47.590]  No.
[03:37:47.590 --> 03:37:48.751]  But they are steering it.
[03:37:48.751 --> 03:37:50.732]  They are massively influencing it.
[03:37:50.732 --> 03:37:51.953]  This is all word for word what I said.
[03:37:52.728 --> 03:37:59.071]  The Washington Post published an article on June 9th with the headline, Obama Advisor Faces Scrutiny Over Mortgage Deals.
[03:37:59.071 --> 03:38:11.578]  It reports that James J. Johnson, former Fannie Mae CEO, is leading Barack Obama's vice presidential search process, and that Johnson is a former member of the American Friends of Bilderberg.
[03:38:11.578 --> 03:38:13.259]  Rare mention, they at least mentioned it.
[03:38:13.259 --> 03:38:17.721]  Jim Tucker, co-founder of American Free Press, has been investigating the Bilderberg Group for over a quarter century.
[03:38:18.385 --> 03:38:24.089]  His research of the Bilderberg Group has been highly praised by participants of the protests at Chantilly.
[03:38:24.089 --> 03:38:26.971]  He is author of Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary, 2005.
[03:38:26.971 --> 03:38:33.255]  John Ronson, author of them, describes Bilderberg Group for CNN several years ago.
[03:38:33.255 --> 03:38:35.416]  He's a big whitewasher, by the way.
[03:38:35.416 --> 03:38:40.059]  Many members of Bilderberg see themselves in much the same way as the conspiracy theorists see them.
[03:38:40.059 --> 03:38:42.841]  As shadowy figures out to influence world events.
[03:38:42.841 --> 03:38:45.422]  They see themselves as wise globalist centrists.
[03:38:45.422 --> 03:38:46.103]  Yeah, centrists.
[03:38:46.790 --> 03:38:52.192]  Many of them, anti-Bilderberg conspiracists, see them as twigs in a tidal wave of globalization.
[03:38:52.192 --> 03:38:53.693]  They see themselves as nationalists.
[03:38:53.693 --> 03:38:58.935]  World government is what Bilderberg are into, the idea of global community and a one-world order.
[03:38:58.935 --> 03:39:01.496]  The Bilderberg group sees themselves as headhunters.
[03:39:01.496 --> 03:39:10.519]  They'll get an up-and-coming politician who they think may be a presidential or prime minister one day, and as globalists and industrial leaders, they try to influence them.
[03:39:10.519 --> 03:39:11.920]  Yeah, right, they run them.
[03:39:11.920 --> 03:39:13.741]  Bilderberg's security
[03:39:16.312 --> 03:39:19.854]  Hulk's back to Henry Kissinger, who loves the idea of working in the shadows.
[03:39:19.854 --> 03:39:21.976]  The secret he gives rives to conspiracy theories.
[03:39:21.976 --> 03:39:23.217]  Now, we've gotten their minutes out.
[03:39:23.217 --> 03:39:24.858]  We know what their agenda is.
[03:39:24.858 --> 03:39:26.959]  The CNN interview can be seen at YouTube.
[03:39:26.959 --> 03:39:30.742]  Here, the press release for the official Bilderberg Group that we forced them to release.
[03:39:30.742 --> 03:39:32.423]  That's a big victory.
[03:39:32.423 --> 03:39:33.303]  You can click on that.
[03:39:33.303 --> 03:39:36.065]  Or he says the website's owned and run by Alex Jones.
[03:39:36.065 --> 03:39:38.567]  Show photos and videos on the Chantilly event.
[03:39:38.567 --> 03:39:41.329]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:39:41.329 --> 03:39:44.191]  There appears to be a wide range of opinions about Bilderberg Group.
[03:39:44.191 --> 03:39:45.892]  This report represents only the tip of the iceberg.
[03:39:46.562 --> 03:39:48.503]  Really nice report.
[03:39:48.503 --> 03:40:01.128]  He's got a group photo there of all of us out there and up at the top he's got a photo of me with other folks and we really appreciate the fine job that he did.
[03:40:01.128 --> 03:40:02.749]  Very accurate reporting everything he said.
[03:40:02.749 --> 03:40:06.130]  He backed up with even their own admissions.
[03:40:06.130 --> 03:40:09.172]  This is an excellent report so I am very excited.
[03:40:09.172 --> 03:40:12.013]  I mean this this paper is huge folks and it's not just
[03:40:12.887 --> 03:40:22.910]  The millions of people every day that read it who pick it up, it's the millions of Falun Gong practitioners all over the world, tens of millions, who support it and promote it.
[03:40:22.910 --> 03:40:26.671]  You call it kind of a Buddhist exercise group, most of them aren't even religious.
[03:40:26.671 --> 03:40:29.732]  They get harvested for their organs a lot because they're so healthy.
[03:40:29.732 --> 03:40:34.293]  They exercise about three hours a day, eat only organic food, work out all the time.
[03:40:34.293 --> 03:40:36.894]  I think a really classy group of people.
[03:40:39.704 --> 03:40:45.288]  I've had scum, we posted a video, the Epoch Times guy interviewing me Saturday, or was it Sunday?
[03:40:45.288 --> 03:40:52.053]  And on YouTube, people are going, Falun Gong scum, you need to die, you're all a bunch of anti-Chinese scum.
[03:40:52.053 --> 03:40:53.874]  Most of them are Chinese, by the way.
[03:40:53.874 --> 03:40:55.175]  So how are they anti-Chinese scum?
[03:40:55.175 --> 03:40:56.896]  I'm just sick of the New World Order, man.
[03:40:56.896 --> 03:41:01.139]  Can't you send guys, leave anybody alone that doesn't love your tyranny?
[03:41:01.139 --> 03:41:04.902]  Alright, I'm going to blast through a few phone calls and finish up with what happened in Bilderberg.
[03:41:10.319 --> 03:41:11.260]  I gotta go quicker here.
[03:41:11.260 --> 03:41:12.582]  John in Ohio, go ahead.
[03:41:12.582 --> 03:41:23.978]  Yeah, you said the Israeli government and the American government just about every day have been threatening an unprovoked aggression attack against Iran, who has attacked a country
[03:41:25.012 --> 03:41:28.595]  You know, since it was founded as its mother.
[03:41:28.595 --> 03:41:31.077]  No, it's been overthrown twice by the U.S.
[03:41:31.077 --> 03:41:35.521]  and it's been invaded by the United States and over a million of them were murdered.
[03:41:35.521 --> 03:41:38.584]  And it's totally evil and I'm not disagreeing with you.
[03:41:38.584 --> 03:41:47.593]  Well, the point I'd like to make is that I believe that anyone who says, repeats this totally discredited quote
[03:41:48.388 --> 03:41:54.793]  That is endlessly repeated to the dumbed-down American public, which has been completely exploded all across the internet.
[03:41:54.793 --> 03:42:08.582]  Yes, Ahmadinejad said the regime of Zionism will vanish from history's pages, and then that was falsely quoted, and it's an absolute fact, to say we will drive Israel into the sea and kill everybody.
[03:42:08.582 --> 03:42:09.703]  That's absolutely true.
[03:42:10.303 --> 03:42:14.064]  And they also had a letter to President Bush about two years ago.
[03:42:14.064 --> 03:42:14.864]  Let me just stop you.
[03:42:14.864 --> 03:42:16.384]  Do you know how far Corsi's come?
[03:42:16.384 --> 03:42:21.265]  He's come from two years ago here, believing all of it, saying they carried out 9-11.
[03:42:21.265 --> 03:42:23.106]  Basically, it's a new world order.
[03:42:23.106 --> 03:42:24.346]  They control the left and the right.
[03:42:24.346 --> 03:42:30.107]  I mean, you know, I respect Corsi because he's right on economics, right on peak oil, right on so much.
[03:42:30.107 --> 03:42:31.887]  But then, and he's coming along.
[03:42:31.887 --> 03:42:34.128]  I mean, I really think he means well.
[03:42:34.128 --> 03:42:35.088]  I don't think he's an operative.
[03:42:35.626 --> 03:42:36.767]  Well, I think he is.
[03:42:36.767 --> 03:42:37.687]  I absolutely do.
[03:42:37.687 --> 03:42:42.691]  I think he's a poisonous chameleon who adopts the background camouflage of the people he's talking to at the time.
[03:42:42.691 --> 03:42:45.653]  But the burning issue right now is to stop this war.
[03:42:45.653 --> 03:42:46.834]  No, he didn't do that.
[03:42:46.834 --> 03:42:47.914]  Let me stop you.
[03:42:47.914 --> 03:42:48.455]  Let me stop you.
[03:42:48.455 --> 03:42:50.156]  I'll put him on hold.
[03:42:50.156 --> 03:42:51.637]  I used to get in huge fights with Corsi.
[03:42:51.637 --> 03:42:53.398]  I'd have him on and scream at him.
[03:42:53.398 --> 03:42:55.199]  And he said on air, OK, you woke me up.
[03:42:55.199 --> 03:42:56.640]  It's probably an inside job.
[03:42:56.640 --> 03:42:58.602]  And then he's saying he doesn't want a war with Iran.
[03:42:58.602 --> 03:43:00.243]  He did two years ago.
[03:43:00.243 --> 03:43:03.185]  So, I mean, a chameleon, he goes on other shows and says that.
[03:43:04.281 --> 03:43:30.514]  What I'm saying, what I'm saying is here, he's sophisticated enough, he knows, even a semi-literate person knows that that is a total lie, the primary lie that is being used to throw people into this war, and furthermore, I've heard him over the years going beyond what would actually make the neocons blush with the kind of scaremongering propaganda on coast to coast, framing up every country that has been attacked and set up for attack from Iran, Iraq,
[03:43:32.688 --> 03:43:42.732]  I absolutely believe a man of his sophistication knew exactly what he was doing, because even Cheney, Bush, and McCain and these types would not make those kinds of claims.
[03:43:42.732 --> 03:43:45.614]  I've heard him on another program concerning Obama.
[03:43:55.897 --> 03:44:03.263]  For not being enough of a neocon, I have my condemnation of him for precisely being a disguised neocon.
[03:44:03.263 --> 03:44:05.765]  Hey, John, gotta move on, but you have no argument for me.
[03:44:05.765 --> 03:44:09.808]  I am not going to vote for Barack Obama, and I'm not going to vote for John McCain.
[03:44:09.808 --> 03:44:12.330]  I appreciate your call, okay?
[03:44:12.330 --> 03:44:15.052]  I mean, I'm not voting for either one.
[03:44:15.052 --> 03:44:19.956]  There is, you know, it's kind of like if you went to a hamburger place and they said, we're selling horse dung for dinner.
[03:44:19.956 --> 03:44:22.658]  And they can say, we got dried horse dung and we got
[03:44:23.306 --> 03:44:24.187]  What horse dung?
[03:44:24.187 --> 03:44:26.989]  Which pile of horse dung do you want to eat?
[03:44:26.989 --> 03:44:29.291]  I'm going to say I don't want horse dung on the menu.
[03:44:29.291 --> 03:44:31.093]  I'm leaving.
[03:44:31.093 --> 03:44:36.677]  Now, I personally have looked into Obama's eyes and seen glimmers of evil.
[03:44:36.677 --> 03:44:37.998]  I have a pretty good discernment.
[03:44:37.998 --> 03:44:40.380]  I think he's a total tool on the front with a lot of charisma.
[03:44:40.380 --> 03:44:42.582]  I don't think he's that evil yet.
[03:44:42.582 --> 03:44:44.604]  I don't like him, but his handlers are pure evil.
[03:44:45.419 --> 03:44:47.320]  I physically get ill when I look at Hillary.
[03:44:47.320 --> 03:44:48.260]  I mean, I literally turn away.
[03:44:48.260 --> 03:44:49.721]  I mean, her fakeness, her evil.
[03:44:49.721 --> 03:44:51.041]  I can't look at her.
[03:44:51.041 --> 03:44:54.062]  McCain is a complete nutcase.
[03:44:54.062 --> 03:44:55.683]  I can't look at him.
[03:44:55.683 --> 03:44:58.664]  And I guess after many years of looking at Obama, I'll get to where I'm nauseated.
[03:44:58.664 --> 03:44:59.884]  I understand.
[03:44:59.884 --> 03:45:01.065]  But I'm not discussing it.
[03:45:01.065 --> 03:45:02.145]  I mean, it's all a diversion.
[03:45:02.145 --> 03:45:03.026]  It's all a distraction.
[03:45:03.026 --> 03:45:05.987]  I think people should know about Obama.
[03:45:05.987 --> 03:45:07.287]  We'll expose him and McCain.
[03:45:07.287 --> 03:45:09.768]  But other than that, I'm not going to vote for either one of them.
[03:45:09.768 --> 03:45:12.969]  Okay, let's go to Daily On, I believe, North Carolina.
[03:45:12.969 --> 03:45:15.050]  Alex.
[03:45:15.677 --> 03:45:16.937]  Yeah.
[03:45:16.937 --> 03:45:19.398]  Yeah, I'd like to bring up two points.
[03:45:19.398 --> 03:45:26.220]  First is, I've been noticing the presence of black and green helicopters in the area.
[03:45:26.220 --> 03:45:31.682]  And not just in the city, but also in the rural areas as well.
[03:45:31.682 --> 03:45:35.003]  And I was wondering if there was some sort of literature on that.
[03:45:35.003 --> 03:45:37.184]  I'd have to look at the aircraft.
[03:45:37.184 --> 03:45:39.605]  I can tell you exactly what agency they're with.
[03:45:39.605 --> 03:45:39.985]  Okay.
[03:45:39.985 --> 03:45:44.126]  And another thing, I have a friend who received a threatened email
[03:45:44.915 --> 03:45:49.338]  Most of those get sent out by dummy Trojans that come and take over other people's computers?
[03:46:12.301 --> 03:46:18.785]  Well, mainly it's institution computers like government facilities, universities, public school computers.
[03:46:18.785 --> 03:46:20.607]  Hackers dial into them.
[03:46:20.607 --> 03:46:25.250]  A lot of it's the government that's been proven to create a bad name for the web so they can regulate it.
[03:46:25.250 --> 03:46:30.574]  And then it'll take over your computer and then off of its server using it as a proxy.
[03:46:30.574 --> 03:46:32.975]  And then they're using a proxy to get to your computer.
[03:46:32.975 --> 03:46:37.818]  They will send out, you know, a thousand emails that then use and then they'll go get into other computers and do it.
[03:46:37.818 --> 03:46:39.920]  And it's just all a big diversion, all a big distraction.
[03:46:40.783 --> 03:46:43.724]  Uh, I mean, you'll know when you get a real phone call or a real email.
[03:46:43.724 --> 03:46:44.784]  It'll say by your name.
[03:46:44.784 --> 03:46:48.786]  You know, they'll call up and say, Hey, Mr. Johnson or whatever your last name is.
[03:46:48.786 --> 03:46:51.446]  Uh, you know, we're going to kill you.
[03:46:51.446 --> 03:46:57.128]  And if they really want you to know it's true, they'll say, you know, that little dog's back there playing in the backyard, chasing a squirrel.
[03:46:57.128 --> 03:47:00.889]  What a cute little pink necklace it has.
[03:47:00.889 --> 03:47:02.350]  How about I murder that little dog?
[03:47:02.350 --> 03:47:04.210]  Like I'm going to slit your throat, you whore.
[03:47:04.210 --> 03:47:04.670]  You hear me?
[03:47:04.670 --> 03:47:05.611]  You whore.
[03:47:05.611 --> 03:47:06.831]  We're going to cut your head off.
[03:47:07.486 --> 03:47:10.507]  That's the kind of calls my wife's had before.
[03:47:10.507 --> 03:47:12.248]  So, you know, that's what it's like.
[03:47:12.248 --> 03:47:18.410]  Or you answer the phone and it's a woman going, baby, baby, you gave me disease.
[03:47:18.410 --> 03:47:19.710]  You gave me a disease.
[03:47:19.710 --> 03:47:27.993]  And then they'll do it right when your wife's with you in the house and you hang up and your wife gets paranoid and they call the number back and, you know, it's some pay phone, the person's answering.
[03:47:27.993 --> 03:47:30.834]  Or they'll call your house and say, is Alex there?
[03:47:30.834 --> 03:47:31.654]  Well, no, he's not there.
[03:47:31.654 --> 03:47:33.235]  Would you like to message him?
[03:47:34.182 --> 03:47:34.943]  I thought he lives alone.
[03:47:34.943 --> 03:47:36.344]  I want to talk to him.
[03:47:36.344 --> 03:47:37.365]  I need to talk to him.
[03:47:37.365 --> 03:47:38.285]  Well, this is his wife.
[03:47:38.285 --> 03:47:39.026]  Leave the number.
[03:47:39.026 --> 03:47:39.907]  Well, he can't have a wife.
[03:47:39.907 --> 03:47:40.387]  We're together.
[03:47:40.387 --> 03:47:41.968]  We're having a baby.
[03:47:41.968 --> 03:47:44.570]  You know, or, you know what?
[03:47:44.570 --> 03:47:49.334]  If you want to know what a real PSYOP is, how about we burn your house down and kill your children?
[03:47:50.071 --> 03:47:54.594]  You know, that's the type of stuff, and that's when you know the government is pure scum.
[03:47:54.594 --> 03:48:01.679]  I mean, the top echelons, and now they've got sociopathic killers who've been murdering people in Iraq, Afghanistan, Serbia.
[03:48:01.679 --> 03:48:02.779]  They're coming back.
[03:48:02.779 --> 03:48:14.567]  A age of death and destruction and wickedness and just feeding on us and running wild on us is now in burning down governors' mansions and blaming it on people and just total wickedness is upon us.
[03:48:15.296 --> 03:48:24.063]  And I just tell you, out of everybody you can, discredit this government like your life depends on it, because they've got to totally be discredited, and we've almost done it, so it just completely falls apart.
[03:48:24.063 --> 03:48:27.886]  Now, instead of them going into pure fascism, we have to just have it fall apart.
[03:48:27.886 --> 03:48:29.087]  That's the best we can hope for.
[03:48:29.087 --> 03:48:35.112]  So is there any program that you recommend to prevent a takeover?
[03:48:35.112 --> 03:48:36.393]  A program?
[03:48:36.393 --> 03:48:39.936]  Right, like an anti-spyware, anti-virus program?
[03:48:39.936 --> 03:48:40.937]  You know, just so what?
[03:48:40.937 --> 03:48:42.478]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[03:48:42.478 --> 03:48:44.440]  I'm the tip of the spear here with a few other people.
[03:48:44.975 --> 03:48:46.276]  I'm the big fish, folks.
[03:48:46.276 --> 03:48:46.976]  I'm alive.
[03:48:46.976 --> 03:48:47.477]  I'm fine.
[03:48:47.477 --> 03:48:48.397]  I'm still breathing.
[03:48:48.397 --> 03:48:50.279]  I'm a canary in the coal mine.
[03:48:50.279 --> 03:48:56.383]  Most people I know in this movement spend their time worried about men in black getting them and being chased, and that never really happens unless you went to Bilderberg.
[03:48:56.383 --> 03:48:58.544]  A lot of people did get visits from that.
[03:48:58.544 --> 03:48:59.605]  Because they want to intimidate people.
[03:48:59.605 --> 03:49:02.187]  They want it to stop.
[03:49:02.187 --> 03:49:02.847]  It's excitement.
[03:49:02.847 --> 03:49:04.348]  It's real life.
[03:49:04.348 --> 03:49:10.473]  I mean, most... Look, do they have army helicopters flying around with the local police scanning through your walls for pot lights?
[03:49:10.473 --> 03:49:10.673]  Yes.
[03:49:12.305 --> 03:49:14.687]  Do they have secret police all over the place?
[03:49:14.687 --> 03:49:15.667]  Yes.
[03:49:15.667 --> 03:49:17.008]  But they're criminals.
[03:49:17.008 --> 03:49:18.610]  Let them know we know they're criminals.
[03:49:18.610 --> 03:49:19.310]  Go and speak.
[03:49:19.310 --> 03:49:19.771]  Be open.
[03:49:19.771 --> 03:49:21.112]  We're not the bad guys.
[03:49:21.112 --> 03:49:25.375]  When you have an attitude of you're on the defensive, they win.
[03:49:25.375 --> 03:49:27.077]  They're the bad guys.
[03:49:27.077 --> 03:49:28.838]  We're the good guys.
[03:49:28.838 --> 03:49:30.420]  We're out in the open.
[03:49:30.420 --> 03:49:31.821]  We're speaking out.
[03:49:31.821 --> 03:49:34.143]  The sunshine is what destroys these people.
[03:49:34.143 --> 03:49:35.804]  They're like vampires, use the analogy.
[03:49:35.804 --> 03:49:38.046]  They can't handle the sunshine, the light.
[03:49:38.823 --> 03:49:39.884]  We need to light more torches.
[03:49:39.884 --> 03:49:42.405]  It's like we're in a big cave with a bunch of vampires around us.
[03:49:42.405 --> 03:49:44.106]  We've all got torches.
[03:49:44.106 --> 03:49:46.367]  And the vampires try to intimidate us and say, Sah!
[03:49:46.367 --> 03:49:47.788]  In the dark, we'll get you.
[03:49:47.788 --> 03:49:49.048]  Sah!
[03:49:49.048 --> 03:49:51.249]  If you light that torch, I'll get you.
[03:49:51.249 --> 03:49:52.710]  You're gonna get it.
[03:49:52.710 --> 03:49:54.431]  Everything will be okay.
[03:49:54.431 --> 03:49:58.133]  If you just let me curl up next to you and do what I say.
[03:49:58.133 --> 03:49:58.833]  Never mind.
[03:49:58.833 --> 03:50:01.695]  Just take that scarf off around your neck.
[03:50:01.695 --> 03:50:03.055]  Let me bite in.
[03:50:03.055 --> 03:50:04.836]  There you go.
[03:50:04.836 --> 03:50:07.417]  I'm your government.
[03:50:07.417 --> 03:50:08.158]  I love you.
[03:50:09.306 --> 03:50:11.247]  Don't light the torch.
[03:50:11.247 --> 03:50:19.253]  And then you light the torch and it goes... And they go... And then they run back into the dark.
[03:50:19.253 --> 03:50:21.054]  Don't turn the torch off!
[03:50:21.054 --> 03:50:24.296]  I'm going to get you if you don't!
[03:50:24.296 --> 03:50:28.018]  No!
[03:50:28.018 --> 03:50:28.839]  You got the torch.
[03:50:28.839 --> 03:50:30.040]  It's the light of God.
[03:50:30.040 --> 03:50:31.120]  Honor.
[03:50:31.120 --> 03:50:32.201]  Courage.
[03:50:32.201 --> 03:50:33.222]  Hold the torch high.
[03:50:33.946 --> 03:50:35.486]  Light the torch now!
[03:50:35.486 --> 03:50:41.768]  Pull out your sword in the Info War, and tell these blood-sucking maggots we're marching on them!
[03:50:41.768 --> 03:50:43.169]  That's the key!
[03:50:43.169 --> 03:50:44.849]  Give them hell!
[03:50:44.849 --> 03:50:50.691]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[03:50:50.691 --> 03:50:55.772]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[03:50:56.112 --> 03:51:01.476]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[03:51:01.476 --> 03:51:07.401]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[03:51:07.401 --> 03:51:13.626]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[03:51:13.626 --> 03:51:17.129]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[03:51:17.389 --> 03:51:22.212]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[03:51:22.212 --> 03:51:23.273]  Do your part.
[03:51:23.273 --> 03:51:25.894]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[03:51:25.894 --> 03:51:35.100]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[03:51:57.612 --> 03:52:08.680]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[03:52:08.680 --> 03:52:11.742]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[03:52:12.082 --> 03:52:13.823]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[03:52:13.823 --> 03:52:19.966]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[03:53:55.992 --> 03:53:59.113]  Yeah, the New World Order vampires come to ya.
[03:53:59.113 --> 03:54:04.457]  And they say, Don't get involved or the government will get you.
[03:54:04.457 --> 03:54:05.717]  Don't be afraid.
[03:54:05.717 --> 03:54:07.719]  Don't have the light of liberty.
[03:54:09.170 --> 03:54:10.291]  Don't speak out.
[03:54:10.291 --> 03:54:12.514]  Creep around and be scared.
[03:54:12.514 --> 03:54:15.498]  Then you'll be safe.
[03:54:15.498 --> 03:54:16.899]  No, not the dog.
[03:54:16.899 --> 03:54:18.461]  Don't stand up against it.
[03:54:18.461 --> 03:54:19.603]  We're undefeatable.
[03:54:19.603 --> 03:54:20.023]  At least!
[03:54:20.023 --> 03:54:20.223]  No!
[03:54:20.223 --> 03:54:20.724]  Please!
[03:54:33.524 --> 03:54:35.065]  Not bad.
[03:54:35.065 --> 03:54:36.865]  We're going to get you if you speak out.
[03:54:36.865 --> 03:54:40.546]  We're going to get you if you're involved.
[03:54:40.546 --> 03:54:43.667]  The way to stop us is creeping around and being paranoid.
[03:54:43.667 --> 03:54:45.667]  We're invincible.
[03:54:45.667 --> 03:54:49.748]  People didn't come to Bilderberg and shut down our whole conference screaming at us.
[03:54:49.748 --> 03:54:50.789]  We're invincible.
[03:54:50.789 --> 03:54:51.989]  You can't beat us.
[03:54:51.989 --> 03:54:52.769]  Not bad.
[03:55:08.693 --> 03:55:12.494]  That's right, government, we're your overlords!
[03:55:12.494 --> 03:55:15.735]  Alright, Corey in California, go ahead.
[03:55:15.735 --> 03:55:17.255]  You cracked me up, Alex.
[03:55:17.255 --> 03:55:17.735]  How did that sound?
[03:55:17.735 --> 03:55:19.896]  That was my bullhorn in studio.
[03:55:19.896 --> 03:55:21.896]  That was awesome, man.
[03:55:21.896 --> 03:55:26.597]  No, I was calling, um... You actually did get a little press from the...
[03:55:27.256 --> 03:55:28.496]  Mainstream media.
[03:55:28.496 --> 03:55:33.958]  Don't call the radio show that covers it, we'll get you!
[03:55:33.958 --> 03:55:36.479]  Nah, anyways, um, Slate.
[03:55:36.479 --> 03:55:38.760]  It's not print, but it's online.
[03:55:38.760 --> 03:55:41.041]  That's the Washington Post online fake blog.
[03:55:41.041 --> 03:55:42.141]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:55:42.141 --> 03:55:43.681]  My little joke's about Hilgerberg.
[03:55:43.681 --> 03:55:48.803]  Oh, it exists, but it's nothing!
[03:55:48.803 --> 03:55:51.384]  Yeah, well, long story short, it's a total whitewash.
[03:55:53.208 --> 03:55:59.410]  Take your vaccines, drink your fluoride, the government loves you!
[03:55:59.410 --> 03:56:02.010]  Well, if you say so, I guess.
[03:56:02.010 --> 03:56:03.611]  Anything else, sir?
[03:56:03.611 --> 03:56:05.831]  Nah, that was it, Alex, pretty much.
[03:56:05.831 --> 03:56:08.552]  Well, then I want you to add anything you want to add.
[03:56:08.552 --> 03:56:11.653]  Okay, well, um, what do you think about the warmongering in Iran?
[03:56:11.653 --> 03:56:15.854]  I think it's wonderful for our safety.
[03:56:15.854 --> 03:56:16.714]  We need to.
[03:56:18.949 --> 03:56:20.769]  Oh, you should definitely do this more, Alex.
[03:56:20.769 --> 03:56:23.850]  It lightens up the whole situation.
[03:56:23.850 --> 03:56:24.450]  I don't know why.
[03:56:24.450 --> 03:56:25.350]  I try to be serious.
[03:56:25.350 --> 03:56:26.790]  I just screw around some.
[03:56:26.790 --> 03:56:27.771]  Oh, you gotta do it sometimes.
[03:56:27.771 --> 03:56:29.471]  Once I played... No, don't!
[03:56:29.471 --> 03:56:33.292]  Don't go out of the show with that Smokey and the Bandit at the last minute!
[03:56:33.292 --> 03:56:35.352]  It makes me scared!
[03:56:35.352 --> 03:56:36.952]  Oh, I hate the Patriots!
[03:56:36.952 --> 03:56:44.254]  Oh, God, they might actually get their blood up and stop being cowards and find out how weak we are inside the New World Order!
[03:56:44.254 --> 03:56:45.154]  No, please!
[03:56:47.294 --> 03:56:48.635]  Oh, no.
[03:56:48.635 --> 03:56:49.535]  Not that.
[03:56:49.535 --> 03:56:50.895]  Oh, please, no.
[03:56:50.895 --> 03:56:52.576]  And just submit to government.
[03:56:52.576 --> 03:56:53.556]  Take the shots.
[03:56:53.556 --> 03:56:55.137]  Let me brain damage you.
[03:56:55.137 --> 03:56:56.257]  I want to be rule you.
[03:56:56.257 --> 03:56:57.838]  Please, don't fight back.
[03:56:57.838 --> 03:56:59.479]  Oh, no.
[03:56:59.479 --> 03:57:02.940]  I'll send men with guns to intimidate you with that cuff.
[03:57:02.940 --> 03:57:04.280]  Oh, the government loves you.
[03:57:04.280 --> 03:57:06.041]  Oh, my God, the public's getting wise to us.
[03:57:06.041 --> 03:57:07.161]  Everybody's waking up.
[03:57:07.161 --> 03:57:09.442]  Oh, God, let's stage more terror attacks.
[03:57:09.442 --> 03:57:11.003]  That'll scare them into submission.
[03:57:12.268 --> 03:57:15.190]  Is that your David Rockefeller impressionation or what?
[03:57:15.190 --> 03:57:31.319]  You know, speak of the devil, a guy at the Bilderberg event, he called in and got Rockefeller on the phone by asking, Jim Tucker done that years ago, and I was allowed to hear David Rockefeller, the guy's scared to release it, but he said he may release it and cut out his voice and put text, you know, when he's talking.
[03:57:31.319 --> 03:57:36.622]  I just told him again, don't be afraid, I said the same thing, you made the call, now have the courage to put it on the web.
[03:57:37.102 --> 03:57:39.785]  It was like, hello?
[03:57:39.785 --> 03:57:41.726]  Well, these people say you're setting up a new world order.
[03:57:41.726 --> 03:57:44.189]  Well, I wouldn't listen too much to that.
[03:57:44.189 --> 03:57:51.015]  I wouldn't worry too much about that.
[03:57:51.015 --> 03:57:51.655]  Hey, we're out of time.
[03:57:51.655 --> 03:57:52.176]  I appreciate it.
[03:57:52.176 --> 03:57:54.158]  I'm sorry to Chris and Jeffrey and others.
[03:57:54.158 --> 03:57:54.738]  Call me back tomorrow.
[03:57:54.738 --> 03:57:55.959]  I'll be in front of the line.
[03:57:55.959 --> 03:57:58.562]  Before this week's over, I'll do the full Bilderberg breakdown.
[03:57:58.562 --> 03:57:59.883]  A full blow-by-blow.

[03:58:12.867 --> 03:58:16.509]  Gotta go to the streams at InfoWars.com, and it makes this guy angry.
[03:58:16.509 --> 03:58:19.792]  Uh, no, don't go to InfoWars.com!
[03:58:19.792 --> 03:58:21.113]  Not there!
[03:58:21.113 --> 03:58:23.675]  Don't go to that website and listen to the re-stream!
[03:58:23.675 --> 03:58:24.715]  No!
