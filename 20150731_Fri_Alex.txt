[00:00.000 --> 00:13.500]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.500 --> 00:21.960]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:21.960 --> 00:37.480]  jones july is nearly finished the year is running through very quickly and the
[00:37.480 --> 00:41.820]  tyranny is accelerating it's just amazing to see the news day after day
[00:41.820 --> 00:45.800]  besides this planned parenthood issue just the the political news that is
[00:45.800 --> 00:50.440]  coming up the bombshell that the cdc is destroying vaccine documents this is a
[00:50.440 --> 00:56.680]  congressman bill posi on tuesday made his last day on the house of the floor he
[00:56.680 --> 01:01.600]  was given five minutes to speak and he talked about how the co-authors of this
[01:01.600 --> 01:05.560]  vaccine study that they tried to cover up the whistleblower Thompson pointed out
[01:05.560 --> 01:08.480]  said they all got together in the room decided what they were going to get rid
[01:08.480 --> 01:12.280]  of they had a big garbage can there and just start trashing through the stuff
[01:12.280 --> 01:16.240]  because you know you can't can't be allowed to see what actually happened
[01:16.240 --> 01:21.680]  in these studies it's not just the vaccines it's also climate gate where
[01:21.680 --> 01:26.680]  we weren't allowed to see the emails are paid for by the public paid for
[01:26.680 --> 01:31.400]  university professors who are doing research that research conclusions had
[01:31.400 --> 01:34.040]  been published there wasn't anything proprietary about it at the time it's
[01:34.040 --> 01:37.040]  being used for public policy but of course we were not allowed to see the raw
[01:37.040 --> 01:43.920]  data it's pretty easy to put any kind of conclusion you want to in something when
[01:43.920 --> 01:48.960]  no one is allowed to look at your raw data that's the way the game is rigged
[01:48.960 --> 01:53.040]  course we see that with these treaties that are being done but there's also a
[01:53.040 --> 01:56.160]  lot of other secrets that are gonna be coming out we've got a story we're gonna
[01:56.160 --> 02:02.720]  talk about a little bit the man behind the white safaris who feasts on baby
[02:02.720 --> 02:07.680]  elephants the lion king I guess we could call him or the lion king Robert
[02:07.680 --> 02:13.160]  Mugabe a lot of similarities between Mugabe and Obama and we're gonna talk
[02:13.160 --> 02:17.520]  about that because now the Obama administration is looking to use the
[02:17.520 --> 02:24.640]  Lacey act to send this dentist back to Robert Mugabe what's up behind that do
[02:24.640 --> 02:27.800]  you know about Zimbabwe do you know about their economy do you know about
[02:27.800 --> 02:31.120]  their dictator for life that they've had do you know how this is a place very
[02:31.120 --> 02:37.480]  similar to North Korea we've seen the Lacey act used before in the Gibson
[02:37.480 --> 02:43.400]  guitar raids do you remember how that turned out they did in January of 2014
[02:43.400 --> 02:48.040]  they did a government issue of a Les Paul guitar just to celebrate their
[02:48.040 --> 02:52.400]  victory over the government but now it's back the Lacey act where if you don't
[02:52.400 --> 02:57.680]  break American laws but perhaps break a foreign law they can get at you that way
[02:57.680 --> 03:01.320]  particularly if there's something to be gained politically about it we've talked
[03:01.320 --> 03:08.360]  about we talked about it on Tuesday how they were ignoring everything that was
[03:08.360 --> 03:11.640]  happening at Planned Parenthood certainly in the Obama administration but
[03:11.640 --> 03:17.120]  also within the media and then focusing on Cecil the lion so we're going to go
[03:17.120 --> 03:20.320]  into that in a great deal detail while so have some updates to the Planned
[03:20.320 --> 03:24.520]  Parenthood situation several articles we had the article yesterday the original
[03:24.520 --> 03:29.400]  one from Mikhail Thelen talking to the hackers they said hey look this is a
[03:29.400 --> 03:35.240]  false flag this second attack on their website has been done to get donors to
[03:35.240 --> 03:39.120]  support them we're going to talk about additional evidence that has come to
[03:39.120 --> 03:43.400]  light in that we're going to talk about other health news not just the vaccine
[03:43.400 --> 03:50.280]  cover-up in the CDC but now Rhode Island is mandating HPV vaccines for
[03:50.280 --> 03:53.960]  seventh graders sounds kind of like Rick Perry I wonder if their government
[03:53.960 --> 03:58.960]  governor has connections to Merck like Rick Perry did indirectly at the time
[03:58.960 --> 04:04.640]  we've also got an article on from the drug report it looks like radiation can
[04:04.640 --> 04:08.920]  cause cancer after all but don't worry about that because now we've got robot
[04:08.920 --> 04:15.320]  magnets that can eat brain tumors it's not a tumor remember Arnold Schwarzenegger
[04:15.320 --> 04:20.080]  yeah they're gonna solve all these technological problems for us at the
[04:20.080 --> 04:24.720]  same time they're coming up with massive laser weapons it was only a week ago
[04:24.720 --> 04:30.480]  that we were talking about the Pentagon's vision of warfare in 2050 but of
[04:30.480 --> 04:34.400]  course this week we've already seen that much of that technology is already
[04:34.400 --> 04:37.680]  here they're not gonna talk about stuff that they haven't nearly perfected
[04:37.680 --> 04:42.200]  they're just on the cusp of putting it into mass production Japan has
[04:42.200 --> 04:46.680]  demonstrated what some and like the Daily Mail are calling the dust star
[04:46.680 --> 04:51.480]  weapon a directed energy weapon kind of stuff you see in science fiction but of
[04:51.480 --> 04:56.920]  course there's also force fields it's super augmented cyborg humans an
[04:56.920 --> 05:00.480]  autonomous killing robot stay with us we've got a lot to break down special

[08:13.000 --> 08:19.600]  info wars dot-com frontline report it's Alex Jones
[08:19.600 --> 08:29.960]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Friday July 31st 2015 Alex Jones is
[08:29.960 --> 08:34.560]  in Europe he's in Spain and we have a special report you can see the article
[08:34.560 --> 08:40.120]  upon info wars dot-com 1984 comes to Europe the end of freedom in of speech
[08:40.120 --> 08:46.160]  in Spain even jokes about royals are illegal I guess so are the Monty Python
[08:46.160 --> 08:49.920]  jokes about the Spanish Inquisition because that's essentially what we have
[08:49.920 --> 08:54.720]  here I guess Alex didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition no actually they
[08:54.720 --> 08:59.240]  knew it I guess it's still annoying when people come up and demand that you
[08:59.240 --> 09:05.840]  cannot photograph public buildings cathedrals take away your film erase it
[09:05.840 --> 09:10.200]  this is what they do at federal buildings already in the United States of
[09:10.200 --> 09:13.960]  course they do that kind they they say well you can't take a picture of the
[09:13.960 --> 09:16.360]  landfill reserve you can't take a picture of this particular building even
[09:16.360 --> 09:21.760]  though anyone can go to the internet and they can look at Google Maps and see
[09:21.760 --> 09:25.920]  that building taking a picture on a street corner does not present a
[09:25.920 --> 09:29.760]  security risk to anybody and let's understand that all of this stuff about
[09:29.760 --> 09:34.120]  national security homeland security it's just a way of taking your freedom
[09:34.120 --> 09:38.720]  right let's just call it homeland taking away your freedom department or the
[09:38.720 --> 09:43.520]  transportation taking away your freedom administration whatever you see the word
[09:43.520 --> 09:47.000]  security from our government just understand that it's all about taking
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.680]  away your freedom enslaving you you're not going to get any security from it as
[09:50.680 --> 09:56.960]  I've said many times a maximum security area is called a prison and that's what
[09:56.960 --> 10:01.160]  they're building here in America they're building it all over the world that's
[10:01.160 --> 10:06.080]  what we talk about prison planet let's go to that report 1984 comes to Europe
[10:06.080 --> 10:11.680]  Orwell's nightmare scenario come true ladies and gentlemen we filed a series
[10:11.680 --> 10:16.640]  of reports for the radio and TV shows at info wars.com Alex Jones here
[10:16.640 --> 10:20.920]  reporting live from Barcelona Spain beautiful historic city on the
[10:20.920 --> 10:27.760]  Mediterranean Sea but I was just pinching myself like it was a dream the
[10:27.760 --> 10:35.080]  fact that it's in mainstream newspapers what they call a bizarre series of laws
[10:35.080 --> 10:41.920]  that have been rammed through the Spanish government and regulations banning
[10:41.920 --> 10:46.560]  any form of criticism of government period government services you name it
[10:46.560 --> 10:53.040]  and it's also extending on to corporations and again even the
[10:53.040 --> 11:00.000]  newspapers in the UK and in Germany say this is just bizarre I mean it's so over
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.840]  the top it's beyond 1984 for the types of offenses that people got arrested for
[11:05.840 --> 11:11.400]  in that fictional world that George Arwell came up with and then it just
[11:11.400 --> 11:17.480]  hit me the reason all of this is happening is Spain has submitted to the
[11:17.480 --> 11:20.360]  globalist and the bankers because Juan Carlos is right at the top of the
[11:20.360 --> 11:25.560]  pyramid and is being sucked dry right now and they're using that money to
[11:25.560 --> 11:30.200]  consolidate the takeover of US roads US water districts as Juan Carlos and
[11:30.200 --> 11:35.040]  companies like Centra that are at the heart of these no bid contracts taking
[11:35.040 --> 11:39.720]  over US infrastructure so just as the Spanish are conquered then their money
[11:39.720 --> 11:43.680]  is used to come in and conquer the infrastructure the United States we're
[11:43.680 --> 11:50.040]  all under attack by this and it's the corporate welfare the banker bailouts
[11:50.040 --> 11:54.840]  the state-backed companies like Centra and others that are able to do this
[11:54.840 --> 11:58.160]  turning our roads into toll roads doubling and tripling our water prices
[11:58.160 --> 12:03.560]  this is the scientific tyranny but the real reason they're putting in draconian
[12:03.560 --> 12:10.320]  anti-freedom of speech laws and other things here in Spain that even mainstream
[12:10.320 --> 12:15.440]  media publications call 1984 and over the top and bizarre is because they're
[12:15.440 --> 12:19.480]  getting ready to really drop the hammer and have a worldwide financial collapse
[12:19.480 --> 12:24.640]  and I believe Spain that's why we're here is the next domino the tyrants love
[12:24.640 --> 12:28.440]  to have the facade of freedom and when they start removing the veneer of
[12:28.440 --> 12:32.680]  liberty when they start taking that away you know big stuff's about to happen
[12:32.680 --> 12:35.920]  look at what's happening this week in China look at what's happening in
[12:35.920 --> 12:40.240]  Greece look what's happening all over the world and it lets you know this is a
[12:40.240 --> 12:44.000]  very very serious time to be alive so there's nothing like eyes and ears on
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.880]  the ground to really confirm what we've been seeing in the press and what we've
[12:48.880 --> 12:55.240]  been getting from our guests and experts is that the globalist see humans
[12:55.240 --> 12:59.400]  basically like another species a worthless group they've got their
[12:59.400 --> 13:07.120]  computers their robots their automation and this implosion of the economy is
[13:07.120 --> 13:11.600]  about bringing us to our knees and domesticating us and conditioning us
[13:11.600 --> 13:18.000]  to submit more reports to follow at info wars.com humans have the power and so
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.600]  if you take action if you get involved if you inform others there's no way that
[13:22.600 --> 13:25.880]  the technocrats will be able to get away with this so it just hit me that this is
[13:25.880 --> 13:29.240]  about the collapse being imminent not just of Spain but the entire continent
[13:29.240 --> 13:32.040]  of Europe then out of that crisis the true world government will be formed
[13:32.040 --> 13:38.440]  all right Alex Jones signing off more reports coming at info wars.com again
[13:38.440 --> 13:41.840]  we're gonna have some more reports from Alex Jones later in the broadcast now
[13:41.840 --> 13:45.560]  earlier this week we talked about and I think it was Tuesday or Wednesday we
[13:45.560 --> 13:51.200]  talked about how people were very upset about Cecil the lion we had Jimmy
[13:51.200 --> 13:54.400]  Kimmel crying about it all the news media was talking about Cecil the lion
[13:54.400 --> 13:59.280]  everywhere you went there were slide shows but nobody was talking about the
[13:59.280 --> 14:04.040]  latest revelation of the Planned Parenthood video they weren't talking
[14:04.040 --> 14:08.000]  about the previous ones either that was all being pushed into the background and
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.480]  so I asked the question we talked about the different parallels with it the
[14:11.480 --> 14:16.680]  idea that this was a great legal area that there was luring going on to get
[14:16.680 --> 14:22.200]  this lion off of the preservation area into an area where he could be killed he
[14:22.200 --> 14:25.560]  was killed in a way where he died under a great deal of pain over a very long
[14:25.560 --> 14:30.040]  period of time trophies were taken where they cut his head off as a trophy and
[14:30.040 --> 14:33.400]  wheat said interesting isn't it the parallels that could be drawn to the
[14:33.400 --> 14:39.280]  Planned Parenthood situation where they go into these great areas they lure
[14:39.280 --> 14:44.640]  women into the clinics under the promise of health care or family planning and
[14:44.640 --> 14:51.240]  then push abortions on them as Abby Johnson testified this week then they
[14:51.240 --> 14:55.400]  put them through a procedure where there's a lot of pain they chop up their
[14:55.400 --> 14:59.720]  body parts and sell them off not as trophies but in order to buy their trophy
[14:59.720 --> 15:03.600]  cars their trophy homes that's the parallel that we should be talking about
[15:03.600 --> 15:07.960]  of course there's other parallels USA Today Kit Daniels also ran an article
[15:07.960 --> 15:13.000]  about it the parallels with ignoring the murder of black people as if it's a
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.640]  license to kill if you have a badge in this country it's open season there
[15:17.640 --> 15:22.840]  isn't any preservation park for black people in the cities or for the rest of
[15:22.840 --> 15:26.680]  us for that matter we're following along all of society this isn't just about
[15:26.680 --> 15:32.280]  black people everybody is getting shot more frequently because that's the way
[15:32.280 --> 15:39.480]  they are engaging the public now so when we look at this there's even one more
[15:39.480 --> 15:42.880]  thing that has come up of course and that is now the calls for punishment of
[15:42.880 --> 15:48.120]  this dentist to extradite him to Zimbabwe and of course the Obama
[15:48.120 --> 15:51.560]  administration has had a petition on the White House saying yes we want him
[15:51.560 --> 15:55.280]  extradited and punished in Zimbabwe for this because he didn't break any
[15:55.280 --> 16:01.440]  American laws he broke Zimbabwe laws they say well I don't know do they have
[16:01.440 --> 16:07.640]  any laws in Zimbabwe this is a place very much like North Korea Robert
[16:07.640 --> 16:13.720]  Mugabe dictator for life he's 91 years old he became dictator back in 1980 35
[16:13.720 --> 16:19.200]  years he's been there and if you want to know what kind of Banana Republic Obama
[16:19.200 --> 16:25.320]  is trying to create an America take a look at Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe it's
[16:25.320 --> 16:34.760]  absolutely amazing per capita income of $935 I guess about $75 a month $19 a
[16:34.760 --> 16:43.440]  week okay now in that environment this dentist and others have paid $55,000 to
[16:43.440 --> 16:46.440]  do a trophy hunt now you may not like trophy hunt we've had a lot of people
[16:46.440 --> 16:52.520]  say well trophy hunting that's awful well okay fine but if it was not a
[16:52.520 --> 16:57.200]  corrupt government that trophy hunting could be used as it has been used in
[16:57.200 --> 17:03.560]  other places to preserve animals to allow a controlled kill of some animals
[17:03.560 --> 17:08.440]  so the other animals can be preserved so it's not entirely bad but when you run
[17:08.440 --> 17:13.600]  it like Zimbabwe is running it then that $55,000 just probably went into the
[17:13.600 --> 17:21.080]  pocket of their lying king Mugabe look at this article five months ago he had
[17:21.080 --> 17:25.400]  his 91st birthday this is from the Washington Post Zimbabwe's Mugabe
[17:25.400 --> 17:32.240]  condemns white safaris while he eats baby elephant at birthday bash they say
[17:32.240 --> 17:35.240]  when considering what to get Mugabe for his birthday one must first can
[17:35.240 --> 17:39.960]  understand that Zimbabwe's president is a man who demands the finest his birthday
[17:39.960 --> 17:43.960]  parties don't cost hundreds of thousands they cost millions his parties
[17:43.960 --> 17:48.800]  aren't attended by thousands of people but by tens of thousands and they don't
[17:48.800 --> 17:55.560]  eat elephant they eat baby elephant Dumbo this was the predicament in which
[17:55.560 --> 18:00.040]  one local landowner named Tindai Musasa found himself and trying to figure out
[18:00.040 --> 18:03.480]  what he could get Mugabe for his 91st birthday party what do you get a
[18:03.480 --> 18:09.720]  dictator who has everything and who owns the company country and is going to take
[18:09.720 --> 18:16.760]  severe recrimination on you if you don't give him massive amounts of money so this
[18:16.760 --> 18:20.960]  party as I point out cost over a million dollars the first quote from this guy
[18:20.960 --> 18:25.400]  says well we regard him as our father says Musasa yeah just like they love
[18:25.400 --> 18:29.920]  the North Korean leaders and they cry rivers of tears when they die and if
[18:29.920 --> 18:34.400]  they don't they get carried off to the camps he says for such a courageous man
[18:34.400 --> 18:40.160]  who years ago instituted violence and contentious land redistribution
[18:40.160 --> 18:44.520]  policies muasa would bring out the big guns he would kill a baby elephant he
[18:44.520 --> 18:50.800]  said well it's no big deal the elephant was no good anyhow but this elephant was
[18:50.800 --> 18:55.560]  not enough just the baby elephant they say he Musasa also submitted for mass
[18:55.560 --> 19:00.840]  consumption two buffalos two sables five and pallets there was also a lion
[19:00.840 --> 19:07.200]  that was shot and mounted oh a trophy lion for Mugabe the guy who's now
[19:07.200 --> 19:12.360]  demanding along with Obama that this dentist be sent back and who knows what
[19:12.360 --> 19:16.760]  they're going to do to him because he went trophy hunting because he paid the
[19:16.760 --> 19:23.120]  government of Zimbabwe $55,000 to do that that's as I said a legitimate thing
[19:23.120 --> 19:27.160]  to do if you've got a legitimate government but they also gave him a
[19:27.160 --> 19:32.120]  lion that was shot and mounted this is for Zimbabwe's birthday party they
[19:32.120 --> 19:36.720]  also gave him a crocodile that was shot and mounted Musasa said those are not
[19:36.720 --> 19:41.480]  for eating I personally identified the old lion the huge one if you studied he
[19:41.480 --> 19:45.520]  says the dynamics of the lion kingdom these lions are soon ousted by the
[19:45.520 --> 19:50.080]  pride they start to prey on farmers livestock they start to be a danger to
[19:50.080 --> 19:57.040]  human lives yeah boys and girls lions kill and eat people and baby elephants
[19:57.040 --> 20:01.600]  they killed and mounted one and now they're calling for his extradition

[24:19.040 --> 24:24.240]  to export or to extradite I should say the dentist of course we're not going
[24:24.240 --> 24:29.560]  to extradite or send or deport any illegal aliens no matter the fact that
[24:29.560 --> 24:34.080]  they're killing people in this country can't be bothered with that but we can
[24:34.080 --> 24:40.080]  extradite this dentist to Zimbabwe where he paid that corrupt government
[24:40.080 --> 24:45.480]  $55,000 to do a trophy hunt and we're gonna talk about Zimbabwe kind of give
[24:45.480 --> 24:49.800]  you some context for what the Obama administration is doing because there's
[24:49.800 --> 24:55.360]  another context of this as well there's also the raid on Gibson guitar from
[24:55.360 --> 25:00.480]  four years ago because they're using that same law the Lacey act to come after
[25:00.480 --> 25:05.240]  this dentist before we do as I mentioned this is the end of July we've had

[25:37.480 --> 25:43.880]  life comm now getting back to what I was talking about with this export of the
[25:43.880 --> 25:48.600]  extradition I keep calling it the export the extradition of this dentist to
[25:48.600 --> 25:55.080]  Zimbabwe this is based on a started out with a petition on the White House site
[25:55.080 --> 25:58.640]  of course the Obama administration doesn't pay too much attention to
[25:58.640 --> 26:03.680]  petitions we had a petition to get rid of Pierce Morgan they didn't do anything
[26:03.680 --> 26:08.840]  about that but let's go back to this birthday party for Robert Mugabe this
[26:08.840 --> 26:13.920]  is the one where he condemned white safaris while he's eating baby elephant
[26:13.920 --> 26:18.680]  at a birthday bash and this just happened five months ago this is
[26:18.680 --> 26:22.800]  something that is very recent and as I mentioned not only were they killing
[26:22.800 --> 26:27.760]  baby elephants for food they were also eating buffaloes sables five impalos this
[26:27.760 --> 26:32.200]  is just from one fellow who was a landowner that needed to suck up to the
[26:32.200 --> 26:37.480]  dictator he also shot and mounted a lion because we had a lot of people say
[26:37.480 --> 26:40.600]  well you know I understand hunting but only if it's for food I don't understand
[26:40.600 --> 26:44.560]  trophy hunting well they did trophy hunting for Mugabe as well and as I
[26:44.560 --> 26:49.200]  pointed out trophy hunting can be used as a means of preservation if you don't
[26:49.200 --> 26:54.960]  have a corrupt Banana Republic thug dictator like Robert Mugabe this is a
[26:54.960 --> 26:58.160]  guy let me let me give you an idea because this is really where all of this
[26:58.160 --> 27:03.560]  white privilege this Marxist education system that we've got with people like
[27:03.560 --> 27:07.320]  Bill Ayers and others that are allied with Obama this is where all this white
[27:07.320 --> 27:11.800]  privilege narrative of the hatred the racism towards one group this is where
[27:11.800 --> 27:16.280]  it leads you want to know where it leads take a look at what happened in Zimbabwe
[27:16.280 --> 27:20.280]  and of course there was a lot there for people to be angry about they'd suffered
[27:20.280 --> 27:24.920]  under white colonial rule from Cecil Rhodes for a very long time it was called
[27:24.920 --> 27:28.680]  Rhodesia before they overthrew it but they jumped out of the frying pan and
[27:28.680 --> 27:34.080]  into the fire this guy says there's a couple of quotes from Robert Mugabe the
[27:34.080 --> 27:38.560]  only white man you can trust is a dead white man our party must continue to
[27:38.560 --> 27:43.640]  strike fear in the heart of the white man our real enemy now the only difference
[27:43.640 --> 27:47.720]  in what Robert Mugabe says and what you'll hear at a university if you're
[27:47.720 --> 27:52.280]  foolish enough to pay the tuition to go to one today the only thing you'll hear
[27:52.280 --> 27:57.920]  is our party must continue to strike fear about white privilege white privilege
[27:57.920 --> 28:01.720]  as our real enemy but eventually that's going to be focused on the white man
[28:01.720 --> 28:07.000]  and so Robert Mugabe is very upset about these white safaris he said over a
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.480]  feast of exotic animals he took to the pulpit they say this is a Washington
[28:11.480 --> 28:15.200]  Post article five months ago to excoriate safaris he says Zimbabwe has a
[28:15.200 --> 28:19.480]  lot of safaris but very few of them are African most of them are white owned in
[28:19.480 --> 28:26.440]  our region we have the most safaris and animals now why wouldn't they have
[28:26.440 --> 28:34.280]  black people in Zimbabwe taking trophy hunts well because they make $900 a
[28:34.280 --> 28:41.280]  year $900 a year the dentist paid $55,000 because he doesn't live in a
[28:41.280 --> 28:45.680]  Marxist dictatorship he lived in America but of course we're going to go down
[28:45.680 --> 28:48.960]  that direction let's look at what happened with the Gibson raid and of
[28:48.960 --> 28:55.240]  course we reported on this back in a back in August of 2011 headlines on
[28:55.240 --> 28:58.680]  info wars of the time where feds raid Gibson guitar factory over protected
[28:58.680 --> 29:04.400]  wood another one CEO of Gibson guitars main competitor is a huge Democrat
[29:04.400 --> 29:11.160]  donor this is the Lacey act this is what they want to use against this dentist
[29:11.160 --> 29:17.360]  now to sum it up and this was an article that was done in January of 2014 by
[29:17.360 --> 29:21.480]  front page magazine because Gibson at that time was commemorating Obama's
[29:21.480 --> 29:28.280]  raid with a government series of guitars patterned on Les Paul but using the
[29:28.280 --> 29:32.920]  wood that they got back and I want to go over that as well as some more
[29:32.920 --> 29:38.880]  information about this Cecil the lion thing and the hypocrisy from yet another
[29:38.880 --> 29:41.960]  angle that we see from the Obama administration right when we come back
[29:41.960 --> 29:44.360]  stay with us
[29:44.360 --> 29:58.160]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:59.480 --> 30:05.080]  the devil obsessed cult that brought you that huge bronze baphomet statue is now
[30:05.080 --> 30:09.480]  funding a huge effort to undermine anti-abortion legislation the satanic
[30:09.480 --> 30:14.360]  temple says that proceeds from ticket sales from the largest public satanic
[30:14.360 --> 30:18.920]  ceremony in history will be used to support the reproductive rights legal
[30:18.920 --> 30:23.920]  action fund the cult which clearly aligns itself with the devil even though
[30:23.920 --> 30:27.880]  they claim not to believe you really exists has a questionable statement on
[30:27.880 --> 30:31.920]  its website suggesting that the reason they support abortion is to do with
[30:31.920 --> 30:37.200]  personal choice and women's rights not an identification with historical
[30:37.200 --> 30:42.560]  satanic child sacrifice or you know doing the evil bidding of the dark lord then
[30:42.560 --> 30:46.560]  the satanic temple recently launched a federal lawsuit against the state of
[30:46.560 --> 30:50.800]  Missouri claiming that the state's laws restricting abortion violate their
[30:50.800 --> 30:55.560]  free exercise of satanism and that abortion is an essential religious

[33:46.880 --> 33:52.240]  elephant at his 91st birthday a couple months ago and also talking about why
[33:52.240 --> 33:55.840]  he's disturbed that there's just so many people coming to his country ripping
[33:55.840 --> 34:01.360]  them off with safaris when he's getting $55,000 per safari and understand
[34:01.360 --> 34:05.120]  that's not going for animal preservation as it should that's probably going into
[34:05.120 --> 34:10.280]  this corrupt club to crats pockets that's the way this has worked he has
[34:10.280 --> 34:15.480]  parties that cost millions of dollars has tens of thousands of people there
[34:15.480 --> 34:20.840]  they feast on these exotic animals and he has his own trophy lion as well as a
[34:20.840 --> 34:27.160]  trophy crocodile and that was just from one guy who gave him gifts now of course
[34:27.160 --> 34:33.680]  in America we've got IRS political scandals where they're targeting people
[34:33.680 --> 34:38.160]  politically they are committing perjury they're committing cover-up will the
[34:38.160 --> 34:40.720]  Obama administration investigate that of course not they're not going to
[34:40.720 --> 34:44.200]  investigate mangosi they're not going to investigate clinton they're not going
[34:44.200 --> 34:47.880]  to investigate the VA or fast and furious they're not going to look at the
[34:47.880 --> 34:52.680]  price-fixing and the money laundering of the big banks no they just give them a
[34:52.680 --> 34:56.920]  slap on the wrist a very small fine they're not going to even look at the
[34:56.920 --> 35:01.200]  jihadi shooter who was going around targeting military recruitment
[35:01.200 --> 35:05.600]  statements no no no it was I don't know it was maybe it was he was on alcohol or
[35:05.600 --> 35:09.200]  pot or something like that that was the excuse and absolutely nothing to do with
[35:09.200 --> 35:13.520]  terrorism that couldn't have possibly been his motivation they're not going to
[35:13.520 --> 35:17.840]  look at the shooter won't even talk about this shooter in San Francisco that
[35:17.840 --> 35:20.880]  resonated with so many people when Donald Trump started talking about now can't
[35:20.880 --> 35:26.000]  talk about that can't talk about the fact that we don't deport violent criminals
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.760]  who come into our country violating our laws crossing the borders no it's a
[35:30.760 --> 35:33.880]  catch-and-release program for our violent criminals here but if we have a
[35:33.880 --> 35:40.040]  dentist that we can make a big deal out of get some political capital from by
[35:40.040 --> 35:43.640]  having a petition on the White House site and then saying we're going to
[35:43.640 --> 35:48.640]  export him under the Lacey Act to this dictator in Zimbabwe they're all for that
[35:48.640 --> 35:53.120]  yeah they're all for that they'll talk all about Cecil the line not about the
[35:53.120 --> 35:55.960]  black people that are getting shot in America not about the children that are
[35:55.960 --> 36:00.320]  getting ground up for trophy cars now where they're going to send him well
[36:00.320 --> 36:06.000]  Zimbabwe this place is high on the list of Amnesty International and human
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.840]  rights watch for places that violate rights violate the rights to shelter to
[36:10.840 --> 36:14.400]  food to freedom of movement residents freedom of assembly the protection of
[36:14.400 --> 36:17.520]  the law there's been alleged assaults on the media political opposition
[36:17.520 --> 36:21.640]  civil activists and human rights defenders yeah you're going to get the
[36:21.640 --> 36:26.520]  iron fist of Robert Mugabe look at their economics very much like what Obama is
[36:26.520 --> 36:31.560]  creating in America a place with high taxes in Paris for private enterprises
[36:31.560 --> 36:38.440]  and government spending is about 67% of GDP and that was back in 2007 sounds like
[36:38.440 --> 36:42.360]  America doesn't it where all the small businesses are closing up and if you
[36:42.360 --> 36:47.960]  want a job you got to go to work for the Obama administration Zimbabwe
[36:47.960 --> 36:52.640]  conservation task force released a report in June 2007 estimating that 60% of
[36:52.640 --> 36:58.000]  Zimbabwe's wildlife had died since 2000 due to poaching and deforestation they
[36:58.000 --> 37:02.040]  say that lines of credit at all the international financial institutions have
[37:02.040 --> 37:08.480]  been frozen because guess what this is the place that has the legendary hyper
[37:08.480 --> 37:14.040]  inflation that everybody talks about inflation rose an annual rate of 32% in
[37:14.040 --> 37:21.240]  1998 from 32% which is pretty horrible to an official estimated high of 11
[37:21.240 --> 37:28.480]  million 200,000% in August of 2008 11 million percent inflation in Mugabe's
[37:28.480 --> 37:33.560]  Zimbabwe we want to send this dentist back to be punished by this by this
[37:33.560 --> 37:37.320]  authoritarian regime it got so bad that they created a hundred billion dollar
[37:37.320 --> 37:43.080]  note I don't imagine Mugabe wanted his face on that particular one maybe he
[37:43.080 --> 37:47.760]  did I don't know the guys got no limit to his ego and then they officially
[37:47.760 --> 37:54.960]  suspended use of the Zimbabwe dollar in April of 2009 now what's going on with
[37:54.960 --> 37:59.640]  their economy is basically nothing but tourism nothing but safaris but he
[37:59.640 --> 38:03.760]  complains because it's white people coming there and as I point out Mugabe
[38:03.760 --> 38:06.920]  doesn't like white people he says the only white man you can trust is a dead
[38:06.920 --> 38:10.040]  white man our party must continue to strike fear in the heart of the white
[38:10.040 --> 38:15.560]  man our real enemy but they want the tourist dollars but people are starting
[38:15.560 --> 38:20.920]  to figure it out tourism fell 75% back in 2000 it's still going down it's less
[38:20.920 --> 38:26.080]  than 20% of the hotel rooms had been occupied at that time and of course there
[38:26.080 --> 38:29.840]  was a massive purge of white people when he got in there so he doesn't really
[38:29.840 --> 38:35.680]  have anybody to blame except for the white people that are abroad he's still
[38:35.680 --> 38:40.680]  blaming white people after he's been dictator for 35 years understand in 2005
[38:40.680 --> 38:44.960]  the government started making overtures said well we'll let some white farmers
[38:44.960 --> 38:49.040]  come back they had at that time or 500 still left in the country you know it's
[38:49.040 --> 38:52.960]  kind of like the number of Jews in Poland after World War two they even let
[38:52.960 --> 38:56.360]  some of the farmers get some leases but they said yeah these other guys were
[38:56.360 --> 39:00.000]  gonna take their stuff the ones that are still here anybody foolish enough to go
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.200]  in there and get back into that thing ought to have their head examined it was
[39:04.200 --> 39:07.960]  just two days ago that Mugabe threatened to expel us and British diplomats but
[39:07.960 --> 39:12.360]  we're going to extradite this dentist to Zimbabwe they say he has threatened to
[39:12.360 --> 39:16.120]  expel ambassadors from the US and Britain accusing them of the problems in his
[39:16.120 --> 39:20.040]  country he says British and American ambassadors what kind of people are they
[39:20.040 --> 39:25.080]  they are no good for us behave and you will be at peace with us misbehave we
[39:25.080 --> 39:31.280]  will kick your bottom that's a quote that's a quote from the source I have
[39:31.280 --> 39:35.560]  I'm sorry I can't see that the title of the a thing here on my printout now he
[39:35.560 --> 39:41.480]  also said a couple of days ago that he will not allow any goats in Harare the
[39:41.480 --> 39:46.280]  city center he says this is not West Africa he says the government will not
[39:46.280 --> 39:51.440]  tolerate the sort of chaos that he has witnessed in other countries in other
[39:51.440 --> 39:54.320]  words he doesn't want to see the starving people as I pointed out before
[39:54.320 --> 40:01.320]  they're making $900 a year per capita that's less than $20 a month these
[40:01.320 --> 40:06.680]  people are starving so what are they doing this is reported from new Zimbabwe
[40:06.680 --> 40:12.160]  of course they have to be careful about what they say in Zimbabwe but they say
[40:12.160 --> 40:16.920]  thousands of people have besieged city centers across the country selling all
[40:16.920 --> 40:20.680]  manner of bric-a-brac in a bid to survive an economic crisis that has seen
[40:20.680 --> 40:25.840]  industries collapse and unemployment reach over 85% but he wants you to go
[40:25.840 --> 40:31.160]  somewhere else and starve so he doesn't see you in the streets with your goats
[40:31.160 --> 40:36.360]  or your bric-a-brac very much like the elites that we have here who come around
[40:36.360 --> 40:39.400]  before the presidential conventions and lock up all the homeless people on the
[40:39.400 --> 40:42.840]  streets because I don't want to see the starving people except it's far worse
[40:42.840 --> 40:47.120]  there 85% unemployment this is a place that had over 11 million percent
[40:47.120 --> 40:53.040]  hyperinflation until they just got rid of their currency could not save it so
[40:53.040 --> 40:56.680]  what's the justification for sending this dentist back to a place where he paid
[40:56.680 --> 41:02.400]  this dictator $55,000 for a trophy hunt and now he's going to be punished by
[41:02.400 --> 41:06.000]  this dictator by the Obama administration because you know white
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.800]  privilege and that sort of thing great white privileged hunter well the
[41:10.800 --> 41:15.640]  justification for this again is the Lacey Act and as I was just starting to point
[41:15.640 --> 41:21.040]  out before we went to the break in January of 2014 Gibson celebrated their
[41:21.040 --> 41:25.240]  victory after three years of fighting with the government because they were
[41:25.240 --> 41:30.680]  singled out and here's the case they were singled out because not their
[41:30.680 --> 41:33.960]  their competitor was not they didn't come after their competitors because of
[41:33.960 --> 41:36.920]  the wood they didn't come after furniture companies that use this kind of
[41:36.920 --> 41:41.960]  wood but only Gibson because their competitor was a big Democrat donor
[41:41.960 --> 41:48.480]  this happened in August of 2011 armed FBI agents with SWAT gear SWAT gear came
[41:48.480 --> 41:53.640]  after a guitar company came after Gibson guitar executing a search warrant for
[41:53.640 --> 41:57.440]  the seizure of wood at their facilities premise of the raid was an obscure 100
[41:57.440 --> 42:01.040]  year old law that they're now going to use against this dentist the Lacey Act on
[42:01.040 --> 42:05.480]  the basis of this act the feds stormed the facilities claiming that Gibson had
[42:05.480 --> 42:10.680]  broken foreign and not American laws notably one of the biggest competitors
[42:10.680 --> 42:15.120]  CF Martin company reportedly uses the same type of wood seized from Gibson's
[42:15.120 --> 42:17.560]  but they didn't have any interference from the federal government why not
[42:17.560 --> 42:21.440]  because they pay their protection money we are turning into a banana Republic
[42:21.440 --> 42:26.840]  just like Zimbabwe under Mugabe that's what this is about they say further
[42:26.840 --> 42:30.560]  more no other companies known to use wood and questions such as furniture
[42:30.560 --> 42:33.400]  manufacturers reported a similar prosecution from the federal government
[42:33.400 --> 42:40.040]  but in 2014 they had won their victory somewhere in the United States
[42:40.040 --> 42:44.480]  government and I don't know where they got justice they say they announced the
[42:44.480 --> 42:50.320]  government series of guitars to rub it in administration and this I'm reading
[42:50.320 --> 42:55.040]  from front page mag.com is a series of guitars purportedly made with the very
[42:55.040 --> 42:58.800]  same wood seized by the US government which was later returned at the end of
[42:58.800 --> 43:05.160]  the fiasco and the slogan was fight the powers that be with a powerful less Paul
[43:05.160 --> 43:10.000]  guitar well good for them we're going to beat this tyranny of Obama this
[43:10.000 --> 43:14.200]  corruption of the Democrat Party and the Republican Party they play the same
[43:14.200 --> 43:18.560]  games they haven't been as out in the open about the corruption but you wait
[43:18.560 --> 43:24.400]  until the subsequent administrations because it is a ratcheting process even
[43:24.400 --> 43:27.840]  though they've done it under the table quietly and of course Nixon was impeached
[43:27.840 --> 43:32.440]  for doing to a few people what Nixon has done with the cooperation and the
[43:32.440 --> 43:37.400]  concealment and the cover-up of the entire IRS service we're learning that
[43:37.400 --> 43:40.880]  they have their own parallel text messaging system because they didn't
[43:40.880 --> 43:45.680]  want to get caught by the emails and then of course when they get subpoenaed
[43:45.680 --> 43:50.120]  by the Congress they destroy the emails it's how there's no backups of those the
[43:50.120 --> 43:53.960]  truth is gradually coming out but we know what they are we're just trying to
[43:53.960 --> 43:57.240]  get the details we know how corrupt the system is and we know that this
[43:57.240 --> 44:02.400]  bureaucracy persists from administration to administration what we see happening
[44:02.400 --> 44:06.760]  with the Obama administration is most likely going to continue to happen with
[44:06.760 --> 44:10.280]  a Republican administration this needs to be cut off at the local and state
[44:10.280 --> 44:14.080]  level we are not going to be able to send a messiah to Washington even if
[44:14.080 --> 44:17.640]  that messiah is mr. Smith going to Washington we're not going to be able
[44:17.640 --> 44:22.320]  to stop this I don't think because it is a massive permanently entrenched
[44:22.320 --> 44:27.440]  bureaucracy now I've got another report here from Alex Jones that I want to
[44:27.440 --> 44:32.240]  replay that is about course he's in Spain and this is one where they caught on
[44:32.240 --> 44:37.240]  camera a man levitating in Spain it's a great analogy about the deception that's
[44:37.240 --> 44:41.240]  going on not only in Spain but also in America here's that report from Alex
[44:41.240 --> 44:50.360]  Jones we're here in Barcelona and there's a lot of magic tricks going on in
[44:50.360 --> 44:55.600]  fact the big central banks are issuing some cases hundreds of times the debt
[44:55.600 --> 44:59.520]  that there's actually money to pay it back for the magic trick of having the
[44:59.520 --> 45:06.640]  control media convince the public that indeed most of that is owed by them like
[45:06.640 --> 45:10.760]  when banks sell a house 50 times or 60 times or 70 times or 100 times and they
[45:10.760 --> 45:15.080]  have the public bail them out with too big to fail that magic trick as something
[45:15.080 --> 45:19.160]  the public buys because the media is run by six people in fact if you believe the
[45:19.160 --> 45:23.160]  six central banks aren't the biggest corporate welfare people out there you
[45:23.160 --> 45:27.040]  believe this guy's actually floating in the air and Rob Duke and over here we
[45:27.040 --> 45:33.360]  can show folks that it's simply an amazing illusion I I personally cannot
[45:33.360 --> 45:39.000]  see how he's able to do that it's amazing until you realize that there is a
[45:39.000 --> 45:42.480]  metal bar going up under his arm right there that's holding him up but you
[45:42.480 --> 45:45.600]  need to know that it is still extremely exhausted but because I know there's a
[45:45.600 --> 45:48.480]  metal bar coming up through there and back through his arm now holding him
[45:48.480 --> 45:53.400]  up I'm a conspiracy theorist a mainstream media person would just say this is
[45:53.400 --> 45:56.600]  real this is really happening so I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist I
[45:56.600 --> 46:00.960]  want to say right now this guy has defied gravity or he's such an acrobatic
[46:00.960 --> 46:04.280]  able to hold himself up with one arm I believe the mainstream medium I believe
[46:04.280 --> 46:06.960]  fluoride is good for you I believe vaccines are good for you I believe
[46:06.960 --> 46:10.440]  Spain is now a free country I believe the EU loves you I believe getting rid of
[46:10.440 --> 46:13.440]  all national sovereignty to the mega banks is the answer I believe derivatives
[46:13.440 --> 46:17.120]  and counterfeiting new world order systems are the way to go and and you
[46:17.120 --> 46:21.560]  know I believe that the new order cares about us so again ladies and gentlemen
[46:21.560 --> 46:26.480]  absolutely amazing look at this illusion it is really hard to believe and of
[46:26.480 --> 46:30.800]  course you can see way off in the distance the real world built by
[46:30.800 --> 46:35.080]  civilization built by humans brick by brick and our desires and our passions
[46:35.080 --> 46:38.640]  that was that was real but the globalists have conquered it through
[46:38.640 --> 46:42.840]  fractional reserve banking derivative counterfeiting fraud again this is just
[46:42.840 --> 46:48.320]  another report from the road on this live worldwide transmission we are going
[46:48.320 --> 46:53.200]  to now throw the broadcast back to the folks there at the infall wars news
[46:53.200 --> 46:58.400]  center in Austin Texas but all the civilization isn't real freedom and
[46:58.400 --> 47:02.560]  liberty isn't real the fraud of the central bankers conquering everyone is
[47:02.560 --> 47:07.480]  real like let's go back over here again 1776 isn't real bill of rights isn't
[47:07.480 --> 47:13.760]  real due process isn't real freedom isn't real this is real Obama is real your
[47:13.760 --> 47:18.960]  free Obamacare is real turning in your guns and having less crime is real this
[47:18.960 --> 47:24.200]  is what's real ladies and gentlemen simply simply give in to the illusion
[47:24.200 --> 47:28.800]  simply give in to the new world order don't get upset about it don't drink
[47:28.800 --> 47:33.680]  three or four espressos like I've done just just go with it okay all right
[47:33.680 --> 47:36.520]  we're gonna go back to the live transmission if you're watching go to
[47:36.520 --> 47:41.240]  info wars.com forward slash show to find the free video feeds because if you're
[47:41.240 --> 47:44.240]  listening and hearing me talk about an illusionist there's a fellow in a black
[47:44.240 --> 47:48.280]  and gold suit of your radio listener who appears to be levitating about three
[47:48.280 --> 47:52.760]  feet off the ground but in truth because I'm a conspiracy theorist and I'm into
[47:52.760 --> 47:57.760]  how things work I realize the fellow reserve is not public it's private and
[47:57.760 --> 48:01.600]  I realize there's a bar a metal plate on the ground holding him up hooked to a
[48:01.600 --> 48:05.840]  bar up under his arm so it appears he's floating off the ground all right with
[48:05.840 --> 48:10.680]  that said I'm not going to give him a donation and we are going to end this
[48:10.680 --> 48:15.760]  transmission but more reports are coming info wars.com if you're watching you
[48:15.760 --> 48:20.600]  are the resistance a very convincing illusion far more convincing than most
[48:20.600 --> 48:23.960]  of the ones that they try to sell us as Alex pointed out and we have an article
[48:23.960 --> 48:28.320]  that we saw in the dredge report today from the independent in the UK what
[48:28.320 --> 48:32.440]  turns someone into a conspiracy theorist well a study to look at why some are
[48:32.440 --> 48:39.000]  more receptive to such theories now this is a new study that will look at why
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.760]  some people are more susceptible to extremist views wait a minute oh okay
[48:42.760 --> 48:49.040]  it hasn't he hasn't done a study yet but he's already got his conclusions you
[48:49.040 --> 48:52.400]  understand that he's going to do it can he's going to do a study about
[48:52.400 --> 48:56.440]  conspiracy theorists but he's already got a conspiracy theory about conspiracy
[48:56.440 --> 48:59.800]  theorists before he starts because he hasn't done any investigation maybe
[48:59.800 --> 49:06.880]  somebody could it should explain to this grant-seeking whore that these are
[49:06.880 --> 49:12.040]  conspiracy facts these are people who are skeptical of the illusions that were
[49:12.040 --> 49:16.800]  being sold we're skeptical of the pat explanations that we see but we're also
[49:16.800 --> 49:21.600]  skeptical we see things that we know aren't going to happen why did Alex look
[49:21.600 --> 49:25.280]  at that no matter how convincing that was that man there that was floating in
[49:25.280 --> 49:28.400]  the air if you again if you're watching this on radio his feet are off the
[49:28.400 --> 49:33.920]  ground his hand is on a on a stick on a cane he's dressed on a top hat and that
[49:33.920 --> 49:37.880]  sort of thing but he's floating in the air apparently well we know that that's
[49:37.880 --> 49:42.640]  not possible because of gravity right that's where we start we start with
[49:42.640 --> 49:46.680]  some facts that we can rely on and we test what we're being told by the
[49:46.680 --> 49:51.440]  government by the media against those baseline facts and when we do and we
[49:51.440 --> 49:55.360]  contradict or we're skeptical of what the government's official story is we're
[49:55.360 --> 50:01.280]  dismissed as conspiracy theorists and yet this guy who is doing the article he
[50:01.280 --> 50:05.720]  is going to have there's a whole article about what he knows about people who
[50:05.720 --> 50:08.880]  believe conspiracy theories already so why does he need the government grant to
[50:08.880 --> 50:13.760]  do this they say that he is about to launch a new study that will look at
[50:13.760 --> 50:17.240]  this is all in the future he hasn't done the study yet but he's got his mind
[50:17.240 --> 50:24.040]  made up that's the way the media works that's the way they come after the
[50:24.040 --> 50:28.480]  public so here's some of his conclusions he says well conspiracy theorists aren't
[50:28.480 --> 50:32.280]  mad and by that he's he's writing from the UK so he's saying they're not insane
[50:32.280 --> 50:38.640]  I'm mad he says they just have certain intellectual character traits yeah we
[50:38.640 --> 50:43.840]  have an intelligence we're skeptical about things you're gonna knock down three
[50:43.840 --> 50:48.120]  buildings with two planes go back and look at the history have you ever seen
[50:48.120 --> 50:52.880]  any skyscraper that burned even for days with steel structures like that it
[50:52.880 --> 50:56.720]  just fell down let alone collapsed after a couple of hours in its own footprint
[50:56.720 --> 51:00.520]  and three of them one of them wasn't even hit by a plane

[55:43.480 --> 55:48.760]  need to have to protect against things in case we have a grid down scenario you

[55:52.920 --> 55:56.720]  disinfectants you want to have those sorts of things available already because
[55:56.720 --> 56:01.280]  it will be too late to prepare at that point in time now going back to what we
[56:01.280 --> 56:04.480]  were talking about just before the break of course Alex Jones had that great
[56:04.480 --> 56:09.200]  video showing the man that apparently was suspended in space where gravity was
[56:09.200 --> 56:13.440]  not working he was holding a cane he looked like he was floating in mid-air
[56:13.440 --> 56:16.640]  very effective illusion but we know it's an illusion because we know about the
[56:16.640 --> 56:21.240]  facts of gravity we know what our government is telling us in many cases
[56:21.240 --> 56:28.320]  is a bull-faced lie as well as I mentioned earlier in the show the CDC has
[56:28.320 --> 56:32.640]  destroyed vaccine documents and this has been revealed by a congressman this is
[56:32.640 --> 56:37.800]  article up on info wars.com yes is that CDC whistle cake whistleblower case back
[56:37.800 --> 56:42.760]  again they say co-authors scheduled a meeting to destroy documents related to
[56:42.760 --> 56:48.320]  the MMR vaccine study the remaining four co-authors all met and brought a big
[56:48.320 --> 56:52.280]  garbage can into the meeting room reviewed and went through all the hard
[56:52.280 --> 56:56.800]  copy documents that we had thought we should discard and we put them in a huge
[56:56.800 --> 57:02.520]  garbage can that's William Thompson CDC researcher and earlier this week US
[57:02.520 --> 57:08.960]  congressman Bill Posey pointed that out on the floor of the house it's not just
[57:08.960 --> 57:14.240]  that of course we have the Rhode Island mandates HPV vaccine for 7th graders
[57:14.240 --> 57:18.560]  starting this fall all 7th graders in Rhode Island will now have to get an
[57:18.560 --> 57:25.360]  HPV vaccine and you notice it doesn't say all girls will have to get it all will
[57:25.360 --> 57:30.640]  have to get it all have to get it they do still have a medical or religious
[57:30.640 --> 57:36.160]  exemption but wait for it they're gonna come after that as well now that's
[57:36.160 --> 57:40.680]  going to be if that they harm anybody there with those vaccines of course the
[57:40.680 --> 57:44.400]  vaccine companies have been protected by the government with legal immunity
[57:44.400 --> 57:48.400]  that's the way this is working we see this pattern happening across the
[57:48.400 --> 57:52.440]  country we see the White House talking about conspiracy theories the White
[57:52.440 --> 57:55.680]  House has its own conspiracy theory here's their conspiracy theory you know
[57:55.680 --> 58:01.440]  those videos those sting videos that you saw other people getting the Planned
[58:01.440 --> 58:04.960]  Parenthood directors monologuing like supervillains talking about how they're
[58:04.960 --> 58:08.040]  going to sell the body parts how much they make cutting them up into little
[58:08.040 --> 58:12.600]  pieces discussing what they can do to make money off of it that's simply a
[58:12.600 --> 58:16.080]  conspiracy theory according to the White House don't believe your eyes
[58:16.080 --> 58:21.560]  they're absolutely fake ah what's fake is the facade from the White House we
[58:21.560 --> 58:26.360]  also see it info worse.com Planned Parenthood president made 39 visits to
[58:26.360 --> 58:32.280]  Obama's White House since 2009 that's why he's lying to you that's why he's
[58:32.280 --> 58:36.840]  trying to get you to believe that this is a hoax he's got his own little
[58:36.840 --> 58:39.600]  conspiracy theory but you can see the evidence for yourself stay with us we'll

[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:24.360]  network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.800]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host today we're
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:36.080]  going to be going to a report from Alex Jones in the next segment the globalist
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:40.440]  cause is destruction what is your cause Alex is going to break down the way the
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:45.160]  New World Order games the system in their favor and what is their final
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:50.880]  solution as a technotronic eugenics nightmare we know that from their own
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.600]  documents of course that would be a conspiracy theory many would say but as
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.560]  we point out in the last segment Obama says that these Planned Parenthood
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:03.040]  videos are fake that's his conspiracy theory you need to look at the evidence
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.400]  you need to look at everything skeptically I remember when we first when I
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:13.080]  first saw the Michael Hastings video and I saw the tree the car crashed into the
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:19.760]  tree and the engine ejected hundreds of feet down the road at a right angle to
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.440]  where the car was it's like well wait a minute that doesn't make any sense because
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:27.400]  if you hit a tree that impact is going to capture the engine into the car as
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.600]  matter of fact that's one of the major causes of fatality in a car accident is
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:34.280]  the engine getting pushed back into the driver's compartment the steering wheel
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:38.920]  predominantly getting pushed back into the driver because the engine does not
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:43.000]  compress it also doesn't fly out at a right angle and then of course it burst
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.600]  into flames I thought well that's kind of interesting because if you look at
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:51.240]  this the back of the car is not compromised whatsoever the car the back
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:55.320]  of the car was in great shape it was the front where all the fire was so it's
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:59.560]  like hmm it's very interesting because you go back and just take a look and see
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:03.100]  how this works it's kind of like you know gravity as Alex was talking about we
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:06.160]  looked at that guy that was kind of hanging in the air there in Spain we
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.400]  kind of know how gravity works so how does it work when cars explode well we
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.080]  see a lot of car crashes you know with Hollywood things driving off a cliff
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:19.280]  they spontaneously explode those are charges for effect it does happen in
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:24.160]  real life you can see some very interesting videos of car crashes and
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:27.640]  that sort of thing you can see those one in particular that was very
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:32.120]  interesting it was a racing track and these were high-performance racing
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:38.960]  cars one of them hits an oil slick on the track and goes into a wall smashes up
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:42.680]  it does not explode because it hits the front of the car and oh by the way the
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.880]  engine didn't get ejected at a right angle either they got pushed back into
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:49.800]  the car another car comes along it's the same oil slick follows the same
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:55.240]  trajectory comes in a couple of seconds about five to ten seconds later comes
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:01.840]  in and hits that car in the back now it's corrupted the fuel tank and you
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:07.520]  have a big explosion but you have to bust the fuel tank that's by the way what
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:13.760]  has happened with with Jeep they just had a massive recall because of a lot of
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:18.720]  fuel tank explosions because people get hit in the back of the car not the
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.920]  front of the car but the back of the car and it would cause a massive fuel tank
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.280]  eruption that killed a lot of people so they've had a lot of lawsuits they've
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:30.800]  had a lot of recalls and that's beside the hack that we just saw where people
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:36.640]  were able to take over a Jeep wirelessly and drive it into a ditch so yeah when
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:40.880]  we look at things like that you have to think about it I'm saying well I see
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:43.800]  this guy looks like he's floating in the midair but I know that that's not true
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.720]  I know that engines don't get ejected at right angles I know that cars don't
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:52.480]  spontaneously burst into flames if they're not hit from behind and the fuel
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:57.480]  tank is not corrupted like that so what other possible explanations might there
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:02.120]  be and then it just happens to turn out as things are going on that we know we
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:06.280]  knew from the very beginning that he had a lot of enemies in the government
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:11.440]  especially in the military because of exposes that he had done when he was
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.880]  reporter but then we also found out that he was very concerned and he was on the
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.680]  run he said the FBI was after him he'd been talking to his landlady wondering
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.960]  if people have been tampering with his car that sort of thing so that's how
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:30.520]  conspiracy theorists operate we kind of look at this as a detective would as an
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.640]  investigation now Obama on the other hand can take a look at these Planned
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.320]  Parenthood videos just pronounce them as being fake because he's been told to
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:43.440]  say that by his political supporters like the president of Planned Parenthood
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:50.400]  who took 39 visits to Obama's White House just since 2009 stay

[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:06.840]  opened fire on a bunch of bad guys who are trying to rob the place he
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:11.360]  successfully defended both his business and his life in the process
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:16.440]  Rami Murar owner of a Milwaukee based clothing store posted video of the
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:20.880]  encounter to the company's Instagram account with a stark warning to any
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:25.760]  other potential burglars don't come to our establishment with guns or try

[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:47.280]  business owner had enough and he put his AR 15 to good use you could see in the
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:51.760]  video how the criminals used a car to smash the doors open so the robbers
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:55.760]  could get in but they are quickly met with resistance you could see the video

[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:10.040]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:19.760]  the globalists know that humanity has tightness power all we need to do is
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:25.480]  begin to release our strength our love our vision and their tyranny will fall
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:31.320]  release the titans
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:01.060]  Alex Jones here reporting from Barcelona right at the edge of the
[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:07.160]  Mediterranean Sea you can say what you want about pre-existing economic orders
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:10.600]  and systems but when you look at the globalist
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:17.720]  technocracy it's very clear they're using pre-existing beefs pre-existing
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:26.600]  divisions pre-existing fissures to exacerbate the old system of imperial
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:31.920]  control divide and conquer but this modern imperial takeover isn't seeking
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:36.760]  to dominate ports and resources and peoples and to drag the best women
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:43.000]  back to the capital to deck them in jewels in the palace it is seeking to
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.200]  dehumanize the population itself because the globalists are now in love
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:53.480]  with the machines the machines didn't build that culture the machines were
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:58.600]  built by the mind of humanity but the globalists have a disdain a predatory
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:03.280]  hatred of the general public as all feudalists have throughout history and
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:10.520]  they've decided their past immortality lies in shuttering human destiny and
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:18.240]  shedding their humanity and merging with some hypothetical futuristic trans
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:23.160]  humanist singularity well even if that was a fact and even if you could do
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:29.720]  that you don't have a right to take over free humanity and make the decisions
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:33.280]  for the general public but they think they do and that's why from its force
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.640]  drugging to forced inoculations the fluoride in the water to GMO secret
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:43.400]  laws by the EU the TPP by Congress unified globally so that we can't have
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.600]  basic choices that's why you're doing everything you can to distract us with
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:52.600]  the most sickeningly ridiculous distractions of Hulk Hogan going hey
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:57.320]  I love black folks they call me this I call them that let's get over this and
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:03.360]  they use that as a way to divide and conquer or they use a few sad cases of
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:07.760]  psycho cops killing innocent people to further create divide and conquer for
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:12.040]  globalization to take over the federal government and local police it is a
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:18.480]  scientific formula and whether you're in southern South America or southern
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:23.840]  Europe or northern Europe or Japan or South Africa whether you're in Canada or
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:29.520]  Germany it is the exact same formula the exact same playbook that we see being
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:34.400]  used to take over society and all I'm trying to do is to get you to realize
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:40.380]  I've spent 23 years 20 years on air almost 21 in a few months fighting
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:44.480]  tyranny studying and researching and learning how they operate reading their
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.720]  white papers reading their books and then coming to you and saying here are my
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:51.440]  conclusions don't to believe me go read these quotes from the congressional
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:55.680]  record go read this issue of foreign affairs go listen to what Juan Carlos
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:59.040]  said go listen to what Prince Philip said go listen to what Ted Turner said
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.440]  go listen to what David Rockefeller said go listen to what Queen Beatrix said
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:06.000]  it's all about world government to cut off your resources and exterminate you
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  and your family and they're smart they do it by successful proclamation
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.360]  incrementally I mean they're cutting off our power plants they're shutting down
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:19.000]  our textiles they're opening our borders as they collapse the third world and
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  flooding Spain is being overwhelmed by African flotillas as Africa collapses
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.280]  after they brought down Gaddafi that was stabilizing all of Africa Italy is
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:36.000]  collapsing when they admit Rome is collapsing they are doing this to then
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.080]  flood with our social welfare networks are well-meaning to further collapse
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:45.120]  Europe further collapse United States is a new political bloc to complete their
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:48.680]  fascist takeover and these third world populations will vote however they're
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:53.240]  told as long as they're given their payoffs as long as they're given their
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:58.240]  their their domestication feed and we're domesticated as well they take our
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.840]  money for 80 years put it in Social Security sell it all out bankrupt it and
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:06.400]  then say pay us even more taxes or we'll bankrupt the whole thing when it's
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:10.320]  already bankrupt it's all about betrayal the globalist have committed to
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:14.360]  betrayal they have committed to evil so why shouldn't they go all the way
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:19.880]  they're committed to their cause what is your cause how can you even be
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:24.280]  committed if you don't have a cause because more than anything today we
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:29.440]  don't have a cause there's only one way the West could be conquered and that's
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:36.040]  if we don't have a cause if we get up our free will if we get rid of our basic
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:40.560]  instinct for preservation of life and that's how we're conquered by such
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:45.840]  pathetic death cults as Planned Parenthood and all this Caitlyn Jenner
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:49.840]  garbage as if that's our culture is a guy in drag nothing against a guy in
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:55.120]  drag but that's our flag that's our culture it's a joke on us it's the
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:00.200]  globalist urinating on us like a dog does another dog it's dominated it's all
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:09.080]  just a twisted comedy for their enjoyment doesn't matter that I made
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:13.120]  in game 1.5 eight years ago and put all the documents in and how they plan the
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:16.920]  whole roll out in the end of the family doesn't matter if I'm right they've
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:21.000]  talked to public that it's valuable to be a slave it's valuable to defend your
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.640]  ignorance it's it's valuable to not be involved it's it's cool to buy into the
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:31.200]  system they say in advertising perception is reality and I've said many
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:36.640]  times if you're on PCP and jump off a 50-story building and think you're flying
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.520]  for four or five seconds six seven seconds whatever it takes to hit the
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:47.960]  bottom you are flying but when you hit the bottom you die so perception is not
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:51.880]  reality you can be whacked out of your mind in a spaceship open the pod bay
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:55.120]  door think you're gonna fly out the space truth is you'll be dead in seconds
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:01.480]  so perception isn't reality and that's why there's a war against reality and a
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:05.280]  war against common sense and claims that raising debt limits don't raise debt
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:09.280]  limits in two plus two equals whatever the government says and they're not
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.360]  coming after your guns but they are is an assault on common sense because it
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:18.160]  stands in the way of everything they're doing tyranny has always been
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:22.360]  overthrown or collapsed from its own weight and now it thinks because of
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:27.040]  technology it's going to survive that and metastasize the next level no it's
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:32.000]  not all these backdoors the NSA built to spy on the people patriots used to go
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.960]  into Planned Parenthood all these backdoors the globalist built to
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:39.560]  control manipulate markets we simply use to get the intel that is the patriots
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:43.320]  out there and they're not patriots for America they're not patriots for the UN
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:47.200]  they're not patriots for Russia they're patriots for justice who want the New
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:50.200]  World Order one of the strongest statements ever was from a hacker that
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.880]  was involved exposing Planned Parenthood who said look I just want him to come
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:58.480]  back down to earth you're not invincible you're not God I'll tell you
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:04.600]  Napoleon Bonaparte was an incredible Corsican Italian French officer who
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:08.920]  rose from nothing because of his genius level skills at artillery and in
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.600]  management and morale of troops but he still thought he could beat Russia and
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:18.280]  he was defeated he wasn't a nobody who was delusional but still he was defeated
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:24.080]  he got too confident Hitler won the iron cross first class as a congressional
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.880]  Medal of Honor a very twisted bad person but but he proved himself out in the
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:31.000]  field it's why military followed him he was a congressional Medal of Honor
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.600]  winner he was like a German Audie Murphy who's Hillary Clinton who's
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:40.120]  Barack Obama who are all these fake people they didn't do anything but they
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:43.720]  think they're invincible because of the PR propaganda let me give you a news
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:47.540]  flash you know your mainstream media is losing the info war you know your
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:51.040]  ratings are collapsing you know you're in trouble so what are you doing smoking
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:55.720]  your own dope believe in your own garbage believe in your own baloney your
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:00.280]  own Bravo Sierra to tell us we're going along with you that's the scariest part
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:03.280]  because you people may cause World War three you people may destroy the world
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:06.960]  because you're so convinced you're invincible because you've taken our
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:10.840]  decadence as we've been drunk on success and on the past victories of our
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:14.720]  ancestors and we're laying around while you're busy running the world and you
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:19.840]  think nobody's there to stop you you are who's gonna stop you you're a joke
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:24.600]  you're a fraud you don't care about humanity you don't believe in humanity
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:27.200]  and you know why you don't believe in humanity because you don't believe in
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:31.360]  yourself you're weak and you hate yourselves we don't need leaders that
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.680]  hate themselves and hate everybody else around them we need leaders who care
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:38.280]  about themselves and their families and who have honor and who believe in
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:42.960]  justice we're going to get it you will never stop humanity you will never stop
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:46.040]  all the people out there that are waking up you have failed and you know
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:52.160]  you're gonna continue to fail humanity will prevail I'm Alex Jones from the
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:55.240]  very front lines of the globalist takeover because right here is where you
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:59.240]  will find the resistance awake and aware and it's happening because for every
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.640]  action there's an opposite and equal reaction so I ask you all out there
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.720]  what are you doing today to spread the word to raise the alarm as a 21st
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:13.640]  century Paul Revere's worldwide it is 1776 it belongs to you it belongs to us
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:18.760]  all it is the Renaissance take it in your hands it is your destiny and as
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.960]  Alex was pointing out there is a eugenics agenda at the bottom of this
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:25.720]  that's why they have to push back so hard against these Planned Parenthood
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:28.360]  videos that's why they have to ignore them that's why they have to make a big
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:34.560]  deal out of Cecil the lion and the hunter who paid that dictator $55,000 to
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:37.880]  hunt in his area now they're saying they're going to extradite him look at
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.440]  this article that we've been talking about how the White House with this
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:43.320]  conspiracy theory says that these are fake well what do they base that on he
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:47.840]  says well they were done in a fraudulent way you mean like the FBI terrorist
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:52.800]  attacks where the FBI comes in and they get everything set up they equip the
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:57.480]  people they transport the people they set up everything and then bust them it
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:01.760]  wasn't done to that level that's what our government does in order to justify
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:05.680]  the war on terror that is not what was done in these videos you can look at
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:08.720]  that and you can see there's not a lot of evidence behind them says Barack Obama
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:14.080]  no there is take a look at these videos you will be disgusted any honest person
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:19.360]  will be disgusted but as Alex pointed out people are fighting back this article
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:24.600]  we had yesterday from the 3301 hacking group that talked to Mikhail Thill and
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:28.600]  through secure email was talking about how they believe that the second attack
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:32.520]  on Planned Parenthood was an inside job and here's their evidence they say our
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:35.600]  contradiction was that they claimed they were taking down the server to protect
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:40.040]  its users but at the same time they added a donation page on the very same
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:45.000]  server prompting for a credit card payments it doesn't quite add up does
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.800]  it yeah see that's the difference 20 conspiracy theory and actually thinking
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:53.520]  for yourself you can see an update on it today now they're saying that they are
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:58.080]  undergoing maintenance but again that site was not hacked if they can still
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:02.280]  take donations stay with us we'll be right back anglers campers and survivalists

[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:11.880]  last segment we had that special report from Alex talking about the people who
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:15.920]  are fighting back against Planned Parenthood hacking their site they said
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:20.600]  because they just can't take the arrogance anymore not only arrogance but
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:25.760]  the brutality looking at their emails and as we pointed out we had the article
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:31.160]  yesterday from Mikhail Phelan talking to the hacking group they said that they
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:37.200]  believe the second hack was faked because the server was still up asking for
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:42.560]  donations on the same page trying to make themselves look like victims here's
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:46.100]  another interesting hack of course we've talked about the wireless hack of the
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:50.520]  Jeep they say that's a vulnerability that all that's about 450,000 vehicles
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:57.320]  made by Chrysler and Fiat are vulnerable to that we've seen people hack vehicles
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:01.720]  in the past the same hackers did this a few years ago they demonstrated it at
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.880]  the black hat conference black hat and defcom by the way are coming up in about
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:08.880]  a week and Vegas will see some interesting reports coming out of that
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:14.200]  but these car hackers that were working with Wired Magazine had done this hack
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:17.680]  before but they had to have direct physical access to do it this time they
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:23.080]  were able to do it wirelessly that's how things change now right now we had
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:29.960]  another hack that came out Tuesday about a hack of a sniper rifle and we talk
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:33.680]  about how the New World Order can sometimes get hoisted by its own
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:37.480]  petard in other words blown up by its own bomb I think this is a perfect
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:42.360]  example you've got hackers disabling a sniper rifle now this is a sniper rifle
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:45.320]  that was set up very sophisticated instrument set up with all kinds of
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:49.360]  computer control so that it would not miss it would turn an amateur shooter
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:57.160]  they say into a world-class marksman but it can be hacked and if you hack it
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:01.640]  you can't hit the broad side with it and it makes me wonder about these
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:04.800]  computer-controlled bullets that are going to shoot around the corners and
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:07.280]  so forth and so on they're going to be wireless are going to have to have some
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:11.920]  telemetry so I would imagine that there's going to be a lot of hacking and
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:15.280]  counter hacking going on with that as well it was interesting that it was
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:19.920]  about a week ago I think it was exactly a week ago yeah on the nightly news and
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:24.280]  again if you're not a subscriber to the nightly news please support our
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:29.640]  operation you can share that with 20 people it's very very economical very
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:33.720]  affordable you get that every night as it happens at 7 central 8 p.m. Eastern and
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:38.080]  I was talking last Friday with Leanne McAdoo about this new report that came
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:43.080]  out visualizing the technical battle field in the year 2050 and of course
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:48.240]  they were talking about a lot of very disturbing disturbing all week when I
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.320]  looked at this report all weekend a lot of disturbing things a lot of things
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:56.720]  that we see that are parallels I think to what's going on with Jade Helm what we
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:00.440]  see with geospatial intelligence human domain analytics you know Jade Helm is
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:03.080]  about mastering the human domain what does that mean well that means that
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:06.320]  they're going to get all this information they're collecting on you
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:10.840]  they're going to collate it they're going to mine it they're going to map it
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:14.760]  they're going to use it in a pre-crime analysis they're going to try to identify
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:19.400]  people before they become violent or extremist as we've heard Wesley Clark
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:25.000]  talk about as we've had a bill put up by representative Mike McCall to involve
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:32.520]  FEMA doing grants to identify people that might become criminals yeah that's
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:38.880]  where this is all headed you know you got to understand that when we did the
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:42.200]  report at the asymmetric warfare center in Virginia when Joe Biggs and I went
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:45.240]  there did some research before we went there and of course you can find videos
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:50.400]  with the time we found some videos that were five years old these are videos that
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:54.200]  had less than a hundred views on them these are people talking about what had
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:59.200]  gone wrong in Iraq why were they losing every one of these asymmetric wars that
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:04.200]  they do where they have counter insurgents that they're fighting and again one
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:06.960]  man's counter insurgent is another man's freedom fighter if you invade
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:11.120]  somebody's country and they come back and fight against you they call them a
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:14.120]  counter insurgent so I guess they're the insurgents and these are people who
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:20.120]  are countering their insurgency but they said that they were what was it that
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:23.800]  drove these people you know interestingly enough they didn't say it was
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:28.640]  religion they said it was the loss of control over their life the idea that
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.760]  they had no future that there was nothing that they could do about it that
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:35.880]  they were being controlled that was what radicalized people they said religion
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:41.960]  came later as an undercurrent and that's why they're coming after the people who
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:45.880]  believe in the Constitution who believe in freedom stay with us when we come
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:50.040]  back we've got another special report from Alex Jones the Bush temple on the

[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:20.880]  we now take you live to the central Texas command center and the heart of the
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:34.640]  resistance is Alex Jones George H. W. Bush God bless him I bless all of God's
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:40.680]  creations was born 91 years ago and I don't think he's doing too well these
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:47.360]  days recently a few weeks ago he fell down and broke part of his neck but they
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:53.520]  say he was doing okay then but he's had pneumonia and other problems I think it's
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:58.920]  safe to say the expiration date on this old boy is almost up now I don't wish
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:05.120]  any harm on him and he is a world war two vet my grandfathers were both in the
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:09.280]  Army Air Corps he was in the Navy Air Force so I have some respect for him at
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:14.160]  that level but let's just be honest as we kind of look back on the archives here
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:20.600]  to a video I shot November 11th 2012 when I was in Houston driving by and I
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:25.440]  saw a George H. W. Bush Memorial Park I'd never seen that before I'd seen it
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:28.520]  online thought I'd go over there and shoot a video just talk about some of
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:34.200]  this history and before we do that let's talk about some of his other history
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:40.560]  this guy is part of skull and bones this guy swears an allegiance to a death
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:48.760]  cult this guy is a Rhino Republican in name only Rockefeller Republican who
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:52.920]  helped bring us the New World Order helped set up the precursor of naft and
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:35:00.640]  gat agenda 21 and that treaty he was anti-gun he was pro open border he
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:05.240]  promoted total amnesty he is a globalist and now we've got his son Jeb
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:09.440]  running for office and let me tell you that apple didn't fall too far from that
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:15.720]  tree he goes along with everything so so so if you want another Democrat in or
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:19.280]  the very Republicans that gave you TPP and the very Republicans that wrote
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:25.480]  Obamacare and then manipulated the Democrats by opposing it publicly to go
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:30.880]  support it then obviously support Jeb Bush but I thought we'd play the short
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:39.840]  little piece on this July 31st worldwide transmission here for you just to look
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:43.640]  at some of the annals from the Info Wars vault knowing we have so many new
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:49.360]  listeners and viewers so you decide what you think of George Herbert Walker Bush
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:56.520]  I think it's very clear that this guy is involved in some very very very strange
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:03.320]  activities and with Republicans like this who needs Democrats that's our
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:07.320]  biggest problem is the Republican Party I've decided if they run the Democrats
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:11.760]  the Democrats run them but definitely at the top it's the same club and as the
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:28.520]  great late George Carlin would say you ain't in it this is a clip from George
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:33.200]  Carlin looks like we lost the audio for that but of course what George Carlin is
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:39.160]  saying they have an exclusive country club and as Alex said you ain't in it
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:44.120]  one side together on the other Alex Jones here reporting for info wars.com
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:50.520]  I was driving through Houston and came across the George Bush monument they've
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:56.240]  got them at the airports here they've got them all over it's just amazing when
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:01.160]  you actually know history and know that his father George Herbert Walker Bush's
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:06.320]  father grandfather to George W. Bush Prescott Bush was the top Nazi under
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:09.840]  Brown Brother Harriman here in the United States it came out in the
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:16.400]  different hearings and this is a guy openly promoting world government this
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:21.920]  is a guy openly pushing planetary tyranny right there there's one of his
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:27.400]  famous 1991 New World Order global government quotes a guy who supported
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:31.600]  the assault weapons ban if you want to know why Barack Obama won it's because
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:36.360]  he's designed to win the Rockefeller Republicans are there to be placeholders
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:40.560]  to make sure the United States can be moved towards the model of China when
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:46.360]  he was ambassador to China in the mid 1970s before being CIA director they went
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:50.760]  in and got him to set up the one-child policy in the planned staged economy to
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:54.920]  use China to leverage out the rest of the free world total globalist puppet
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:38:00.160]  always groveling after tyranny just like his father did for the Nazis and the
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:04.080]  Cormac Dixting committee hearings and it wasn't that they were even Nazis they
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:09.280]  were just groveling up to the fascist order and attempt to socially climb well
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:13.080]  later they found the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and went through just
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:18.680]  being a backwater Nazi agents to being a major political dynasty here in the
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:23.880]  United States and all of the idiot Obama supporters that constantly call my
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:27.920]  radio show and I see you on the YouTube video saying aha your guy lost Mitt
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:32.960]  Romney lost Mitt Romney was designed to lose Mitt Romney was a placeholder the
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:36.920]  fact that you chose Obama and not even the fake conservatism shows you bought
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:40.840]  into socialism collectivism that's bankrupt and destroyed every country but
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:44.240]  that's what the robber barons want they want you dependent they want to
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:48.800]  consolidate control of this society and until you figure that out and stop
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:51.680]  thinking the government your friend when it's run by a bunch of foreign banks
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:54.720]  that bragged that they've conquered this country until you realize what the new
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:59.720]  world order is in their definition in the times of London and the associated
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:04.400]  press when they brag a corporate global anti-free market monopoly government
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:08.960]  that wants to shut you and your family down George Herbert Walker Bush what a
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:13.200]  disgusting dynasty and his son and all of it to destroy the idea of
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:17.840]  constitutional libertarian and ideas and it's worked like a charm to drive
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:22.440]  people in the arms of the peace president Obama launching all his wars
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:26.400]  and trillions of banker bailouts and india and expanding the patriot act and
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:31.720]  all of it that's how they manipulate a shallow dumb-down population so there

[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:29.440]  info wars dot com and I'm here at the George Herbert Walker Bush memorial to
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:32.960]  tyranny and the destruction of America and driving a stake through our heart
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.360]  congratulations Republican Party congratulations Democrats you've helped
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:41.600]  America become totally conquered by foreign fascistic mega banks to carry
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:45.720]  out their agenda of euthanasia against this population via the soft kill
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:50.720]  program of genetic and chemical and biological warfare known as eugenics
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:54.760]  and if you don't know what eugenics is that's the reason cancer rates are up
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:58.720]  over 3,000 percent on average pediatric cancer is up by 10,000 percent you're
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:03.120]  being murdered by the government you love so much Alex Jones signing off for
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:10.280]  info wars dot com introduces reminds me of the who don't get fooled again you know
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:14.480]  the parting on the left is now parting on the right and we've got a lot of
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:18.040]  candidates who are going to be in this next debate that is coming up there's
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:22.160]  gonna be a lot of parting on the right how do we find the genuine people from
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:26.320]  the ones who aren't genuine as Alex was saying a lot of people taunting him
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:29.240]  saying oh your candidate Mitt Romney lost he wasn't our candidate we didn't
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:32.760]  care about Mitt Romney most of these guys don't care about I like Rand Paul
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:37.360]  what he talks about I don't agree with them a hundred percent but I agree with
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:41.160]  him more than I do most of the others so it was interesting to see this comment
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:46.440]  some guy says I can't take Alex or David seriously this is on YouTube anymore
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:49.960]  when they constantly mentioned Rand Paul is the only person we can trust they
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:54.440]  never mentioned how Rand Paul was one of the few first people to support TPP and
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:58.240]  beg Obama to fast track it look it up people Alex and David Knight are
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:02.240]  hypocrites trashing TPP on one hand then supporting someone who's been a
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:07.120]  cheerleader of the TPP before any other Republican well no do look it up what
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:10.720]  you'll see is that we criticize Rand Paul back in the fall right after the
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:13.600]  election he was starting to talk about how one of the key things we need to do
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:18.360]  is we need to pass free trade and we said at the time if he's going to get
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:24.160]  behind these secretively negotiated trade deals he's done his base will
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:30.320]  abandon him instead of what he did was he criticized the secrecy of the TPP
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:34.600]  before the vote was held and there were two votes remember it was passed by the
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:37.520]  Senate then it went to the House they changed things so then had to go back
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:41.560]  and be repassed in the Senate so there were actually two votes in the Senate on
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:47.960]  TPP Rand Paul voted against TPP both times two votes against get your facts
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:52.200]  straight Ted Cruz voted for it the first time the second time he voted against it
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:55.840]  of course Marco Rubio Lindsey Graham who are running for president they voted for
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:59.760]  it both times so yeah get your facts straight I don't think that we're going
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:02.840]  to have a savior that's going to take care of all the stuff in Washington but
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:06.800]  at least we can have somebody who is moving the discussion and things that
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:11.800]  are going to affect liberty rather than playing this shell game like we see the
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:15.560]  Obama administration and so many of these politicians doing so it brings up a
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:20.600]  question since we've got Trump as the front-runner what is he about what are
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:24.720]  his positions on issues he hasn't really said much about anything except for
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:30.840]  immigration on that he hasn't really identified I believe the key problem he
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:35.480]  hasn't identified the prop the idea that we are incentivizing massively
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:39.520]  incentivizing illegal immigration the fact that we have a North American union
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:42.560]  for all practical purposes as we pointed out over and over again with
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:46.600]  Petraeus and Pelosi saying what comes after America North America comes after
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:51.080]  that's what Petraeus said Pelosi said we just happen to have one community with
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:53.560]  a border running through the middle of you know just kind of like Texas and
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:57.920]  Oklahoma is no big deal you know people come and go both all the time there's
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:01.320]  also the business deals that are coming in that are drawing it in and so now
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:05.120]  people are starting to vet Donald Trump they're starting to look at his use of
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:09.320]  illegal immigrant labor to make himself wealthy they're starting to look at some
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:13.880]  of his business dealings they're looking at his lawsuits and the
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:17.440]  testimonies that came out of that but let's take a look first as to where this
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:21.560]  guy really is even on the broad political map we have a story from NPR
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:24.760]  most of Donald Trump's political money went to Democrats until five years ago
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:29.280]  now this is something Alex mentioned weeks ago but this story with NPR is
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:32.760]  interesting because they actually have a chart there you can actually see over a
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:37.400]  period of time how his contributions have shifted from one party gradually to in
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:41.840]  the last five years almost exclusively to the Republican Party and again you're
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:45.320]  looking at the feed this is in black and white if you guys pull up the article
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:49.960]  you'll be able to see it in color the red and blue the traditional stuff that
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:53.200]  they've used with this they say while he framed himself as a conservative back
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:56.920]  when he was giving money a massive amounts to Democrats his political views
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:02.520]  have been all over the map during the last 25 years between 2010 and 2015 97
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:06.680]  percent of his donations have gone to Republicans prior to that Democrats had
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:10.840]  been the primary beneficiaries taking more than half of Trump's donations
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:17.520]  between 1989 and 2009 in other words he starts as you can see in that chart
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:21.080]  there now he's goes completely red for the last five years because he's
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:25.640]  priming the pump for his run as a Republican and it's interesting because
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:29.680]  I said you know one of the things that he's not talking about with the problems
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:34.600]  of crime coming across the border are these drug cartels El Chapo he
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:38.200]  criticizes this guy because that happened they made a big deal about El Chapo
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:43.720]  being let out by his captors I'm sure he bought his way out of there so how did
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:48.160]  he become El Chapo well he became El Chapo because of the massive war on
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:52.080]  drugs when we talk about that well you know back in 1990 Trump did he had the
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:55.960]  right idea to he said in 1990 he said drug legalization is the way to deal
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:59.720]  with drug violence he told the Miami Herald when he had an interview with
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:04.560]  in that same year with Playboy he demurred on the topic of abortion he
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:07.920]  said when asked for his position on abortion he frowned he patted potted
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:12.280]  he asked me to turn the recorder off wrote the writer he didn't really have
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:19.680]  an opinion he said what was mine he said it was a very human moment so he's
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:23.880]  kind of up in the air on abortion he's kind of apolitical on most of stuff what
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:27.000]  he really cares about his money does that make you feel secure when you know
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:33.640]  that a guy is his positions are totally malleable he's really all about money
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:38.400]  I mean he does he is smart he does understand when he said back in 1990
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:43.760]  that you get rid of drug violence by had by ending prohibition yeah that is the
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:48.480]  way you end it it's the way we stopped people doing drive-bys in Chicago back
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:53.520]  in the 20s standing on the running boards of Model T's and opening up their
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:58.520]  Tommy guns on people that's the way you start you start that kind of violence
[01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:02.240]  with drug prohibition you corrupt the police with that but we've done this
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:07.320]  now for 44 years and it's way beyond that it's destroyed our legal system it's
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:11.800]  destroyed families it's destroyed lives we've got we came after the users not the
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:17.160]  Al Capone's we came after the users with Ronald Reagan with mandatory minimums to
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:19.840]  fill up the prisons because you know we have this prison industry that we need
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:25.040]  to keep profitable back in 1990 Trump said you have to legalize drugs to win
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:28.040]  the war you have to take the profit away from these drugs ours he's not saying
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:33.200]  that now why didn't he say in that now well because he is pandering to his
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:39.560]  Republican voters so the question is what will he do if he will say anything
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:44.480]  if he will give money to the Democrats and then give money to the Republicans
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:47.640]  if he's all over the place on his philosophies look at this the internet
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:51.120]  explodes when it finds out who the pit bull behind Donald Trump really is the
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:57.120]  guy came into view because he pushed back against something that came up in the
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:00.600]  divorce of Donald Trump and this was his lawyer and he said well you can't rape
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:05.160]  your wife so that created a massive controversy then we find out when they
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:08.960]  look at this Michael Cohen an executive at the Trump Organization doubles as
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:13.240]  Trump's chief political advisor he volunteered for the 1988 presidential
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:18.480]  candidate Michael Dukakis he worked for a Democrat member of Congress yet
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:23.640]  another Democrat yet another Democrat so the don't get fooled again folks let's
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:28.680]  listen to some of the things that he said and some of his depositions because
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:31.800]  now that they're taking him seriously as a candidate member Huffington Post said
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:34.360]  we're not going to take him seriously as a candidate we're going to report on him
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:39.560]  in the entertainment section but now he is polling at very strong numbers in
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:43.560]  terms of polls amongst Republican Party members so now they're starting to do
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:48.960]  some vetting some opposition research and so what are they saying about him
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:54.040]  well in one of these this is the New York Times I'm reading from he'd been
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:57.960]  grilled for two hours in a lawsuit over a failed Florida real estate project
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:01.720]  Trump towers it had his name it failed but he said it was just his branding he
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:05.680]  didn't have any involvement in it when the lawyer Elizabeth Beck asked for a
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:09.440]  medical break in his lawyers objective demanding the deposition continue she
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:11.880]  said it was urgent she needed to pump breast milk for her three-month-old
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:15.600]  daughter she took the pump out to make her point and Trump erupted in the
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:20.040]  courtroom he said you're disgusting and he stormed out of the room ending the
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:25.720]  testimony for the day now they say that testimony and a bunch of other
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:30.480]  testimony that's been drawn from lawsuits since 2007 reveals his personal
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:35.960]  preoccupations his business tactics and his character folks because he is
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:39.640]  telling us that he is a successful businessman he's telling us that he is a
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:46.000]  great negotiator and those are his qualifications we need to wonder where
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.520]  this guy is coming from because he's not really talking much about policies
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:54.080]  he's not talking about how we need to end the war on drugs today that was 25
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:57.080]  years ago he hasn't said a word about that as far as I know in this
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:02.000]  particular race no it's all about his financial balance sheet and how
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.560]  successfully it's listen to what he said to some of the people who lost their
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:12.280]  deposits when Trump powers failed he said that home buyers who had forfeited
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:16.040]  their down payments in a building that had his name were very lucky quote-unquote
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:20.360]  because the project failed he said they would have lost more money if the
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:24.160]  project had proceeded because of the financial crisis of 2008 so is he going
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:29.440]  to be somebody like George Bush who said read my lips no new taxes we all knew
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:33.360]  that he was going to raise the taxes he had criticized Reagan's idea that you
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:36.840]  want to lower taxes to make the economy go he called about voodoo economics so
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:39.680]  everybody said wait a minute you're gonna raise taxes no no read my lips I
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:43.080]  would never raise your taxes then he gave us the largest tax increase we'd
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:46.920]  ever seen at that point in time and when reporters called him on it he said
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:51.720]  read my hips and he went jogging off is that what we're going to have or is
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:54.800]  Trump going to say well be glad that I raised your taxes because the
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:57.040]  Democrats would have done even worse that's what he told the people when
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:00.400]  they lost their deposits in the building that bore his name stay with us will be

[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:16.360]  great thank you so call in with your comments primarily I'd like to get your
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:21.360]  comments on Donald Trump or Planned Parenthood those I think are the big
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:25.640]  issues of this week so let us know what you think about those will also entertain
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:30.080]  other things too we'll just take open lines on Friday here as I was saying
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:33.520]  just before we went to break people are taking Trump seriously so now they're
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:38.600]  looking at his past dealings with people what does it tell you about his character
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:43.960]  what does it tell you that when Trump towers went bankrupt he said people were
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:47.840]  very lucky that the project failed because it would have lost more if they'd
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:51.520]  gone ahead and bought it because real estate prices collapsed he said
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:56.720]  congratulate your clients he told the lawyers who are suing him those clients
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:01.840]  alleged that they had lost tens of thousands of dollars each on deposits
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:06.000]  that were put down on a building that was never built with his name and that's
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.200]  his response so is that going to be his response to tell you something like that
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:14.360]  when he becomes president can you believe what he's telling you about his
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:18.040]  success of course he's telling us he can't be bought he's not going to be going
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:22.120]  to the confab for the Koch brothers good for him I'm glad he's not but the
[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:26.120]  question isn't whether or not he's going to be taking that money the question is
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:30.200]  how did he get some of this money that he currently has of course a lot a lot is
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:35.320]  being said about the undocumented workers that he had or as many of us would
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:41.160]  say illegal aliens that he brought in to build Trump towers this is an article
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:44.440]  from the Daily Beast came out just a couple of days ago Trump Tower was built
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:48.680]  on undocumented immigrants backs because they don't want to say illegal aliens
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:52.840]  they say the use of illegal aliens and that's my term at a Trump
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:55.960]  construction site such as the hotel described with the Washington Post this
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:01.000]  week is certainly nothing new 35 years ago a small army of illegal immigrants
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:05.400]  was used to clear the site for what became the crown jewel of Donald Trump's
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:09.960]  empire if you go back and look at a story 25 years ago again the New York
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:14.360]  Times Trump says he didn't know that he employed illegal aliens he was being
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:19.880]  sued at the time by union members led by retired demolition worker they charged
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:24.680]  that using undocumented workers by mr Trump avoided paying the pension fund
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:28.360]  they say that he should now pay a million dollars to that pension fund
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:33.400]  including interest see that's the big sucking sound that ross pro was talking
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:36.040]  about is not just the entitlements program that
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:40.920]  Obama is making available to anyone who wants to walk across the open border
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:47.000]  it is also businessmen who are incentivizing this because it makes
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.160]  them money that's why the republican party won't do anything that's why the
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:55.000]  chamber of commerce the US chamber of commerce won't do anything about open
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:59.720]  borders because they're making a lot of money off of it folks
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:04.680]  going to the New York Times article back in May of 2011 buying a Trump property
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:08.360]  or so they thought again this situation in Florida
[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:11.480]  listen to these quotes and see if it doesn't apply to you as a voter the
[01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:15.080]  last thing you ever expect is that somebody you revere will mislead you
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:19.240]  i bought into the idea of Donald Trump and it wasn't
[01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:23.720]  what i thought it was we have to ask ourselves that question
[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:28.120]  about each and every candidate we have to carefully and objectively
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:31.480]  evaluate them we don't need to buy into any more
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:35.880]  phony images don't get fooled again stay with us we'll be right back we'll be

[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:39.160]  talking about donald trump about planned parenthood that broke this week
[02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:43.000]  maybe even you want to talk about the idea that we're going to
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:50.200]  perhaps send a dentist to face justice under robert mugabi's zimbabwe
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:54.520]  a guy that he paid to do a hunt now wants to extradite him of course it's not
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:57.960]  really about that it's really about the obama administration
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:01.880]  trying to detract attention from what they're doing try to attract attention
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:05.240]  from the planned parenthood videos quite frankly we've talked about it from
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:08.920]  multiple angles the hypocrisy of being so worried about the
[02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:13.720]  life of one lion versus ignoring all of these
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:17.160]  children who are being destroyed or even
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:20.680]  the adults who are being shot down in the streets
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:24.520]  under the new rules that our police operate from that are coming from
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:29.240]  washington let's not talk about those issues let's focus on this one dentist
[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:33.240]  let's demonize him we can all feel better about it we can all get distracted
[02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:36.280]  about it this is something that if it was done
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:41.160]  by a government that wasn't absolutely totally corrupt
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:46.440]  it could actually be used to help the animals to call an old animal like that
[02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:49.720]  but that's not the way it happens in zimbabwe
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:53.400]  not in a place that's run by robert mugabi and we talked about that at link
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:56.680]  so i'm not going to go back into that again let's go to your phone calls
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:00.760]  zak in illinois zak you want to talk about trump go ahead
[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:07.480]  yes hi david glad to be on the show thank you um sure sure uh i'll talk about
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:11.480]  trump and i've had many thoughts was on hold
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:16.520]  about it and i would say you know one thing is that trump
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:21.480]  is providing he's providing the topic that your average american
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:27.640]  are starting to wake up to which is nowhere near wake enough but
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:31.640]  so you know people are attracted to him about that but
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:35.560]  but i'll go back to george carlin's comment you played it
[02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:40.520]  uh it's a very very famous comment and he's trump is in the club he's part of
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:44.520]  the club yes he is um he is you know you don't you don't
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:49.320]  get to that type of wealth without being uh simply put
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:54.520]  approached and if you say no to this club you are not allowed to have that
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:58.600]  type of wealth well he gave quite a bit of money to the clinton foundation and
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:03.480]  he said no no no i didn't get any favors for that but they do kiss my butt
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:06.920]  okay so this is the game that's being played and you have to understand
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:10.520]  what is donald trump in it for i'm very concerned about how he got his money i'm
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:13.400]  concerned about some of the things that have come out of these lawsuits but
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:17.640]  also there was the opposition research we talked about a couple of weeks ago
[02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:21.400]  about how he on two different occasions two different projects
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:25.640]  he came after people using imminent domain for his own personal good he went
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:29.960]  into connecticut he went into new jersey atlantic city new jersey and both of
[02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:34.040]  those incidents he came after in one case an old lady who had a small home
[02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:37.640]  he wanted that home for his parking lot he offered her a lot of money she didn't
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:41.480]  want it that was her right not to sell it so he goes to the casino gaming
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:45.240]  authority and says use imminent domain and take the property for a quarter of
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:48.920]  what i was going to pay her for it he did the same thing or tried to
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:52.200]  and a project that fell through in connecticut against several businesses
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:55.480]  and when the kello versus new london decision
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:59.160]  and abomination for anybody that believes that we ought to own anything in
[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:03.960]  this country when that decision came down from the supreme court saying that
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:09.320]  one big private individual could take somebody's property
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:12.600]  because they were going to do something that's going to make more taxes for the
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:15.800]  city when they said well that's for public use
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:19.480]  he said he was a hundred percent for that and we know right now this is not a
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:23.800]  moot issue this is happening all the time this is my big concern apart from
[02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:27.480]  all the environmental issues about the keystone pipeline because they're
[02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:31.880]  giving trans canada a foreign multinational corporation
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:35.560]  the ability to condemn farms that have been
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:39.960]  in families for over a hundred years to take it for their pipeline
[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:44.440]  that's not right that's wrong and it's unconstitutional
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:47.800]  donald trump is a hundred percent behind that so i have a lot of concerns about
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:51.480]  how he got his money there's concerns even in these transcripts about whether
[02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:54.680]  or not he's being truthful about the financial
[02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:59.960]  net worth that he has stay with us we'll be right back with more of your call
[02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:05.000]  a clothing store owner in wisconsin opened fire on a bunch of bad guys who
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.040]  are trying to rob the place he successfully defended
[02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:11.560]  both his business and his life in the process

[02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:34.760]  employees at any cost that's right and you can tell
[02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:37.720]  by the surveillance video that he wasn't messing around
[02:05:37.720 --> 02:05:41.880]  apparently the business had been previously hit by criminals multiple times
[02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:46.200]  and the business owner had enough and he put his ar-15 to good use
[02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:50.440]  you can see in the video how the criminals used a car to smash the doors
[02:05:50.440 --> 02:05:54.600]  open so the robbers could get in but they are quickly met with resistance

[02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:42.520]  interview he had with tom hartman reflections at 90 his latest book so
[02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:45.480]  we're going to talk to you about what jimmy carter thinks i think it's an
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:48.840]  oligarchy i think we've got an oligarchy of royalty with
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:54.600]  hillary and with jeb bush but we also have to look at the republicans
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:59.560]  who are going to run as democrats remember it wasn't but just a few months
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:03.240]  ago that we elected a bunch of republicans because
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:06.520]  most people who voted for them who voted these republicans in
[02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:11.480]  the big issues were getting rid of the gun to our head to buy obama care
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:15.080]  and doing something about the open borders and the
[02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:20.120]  massive illegal immigration and of course i'm for one do not want to see
[02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:23.800]  some kind of a burlin wall built there i want to see us stop
[02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:28.840]  the pull of people the incentivizing of people by both business and government
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:31.800]  to come into this country we understand what's behind this
[02:09:31.800 --> 02:09:35.640]  and we understand the interests that the republican leadership
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:39.000]  share with the democrat leadership on these corporate
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:42.600]  crony capitalist issues that's why they're all together
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:46.520]  on this trans-pacific partnership and the transatlantic partnership
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:50.280]  but here we are just a few months after that and everybody is just
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:55.000]  it's turned into a reality tv show nobody wants to go back and vet these
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.560]  candidates they don't want to see where these guys are coming from
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:02.280]  where they've been donald trump a guy who for most of his life was giving
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:05.080]  money pretty much equally to both sides but he gave
[02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:07.960]  more than half of his money to the democrats for a very long time then
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:11.640]  just before he decided he wanted to become a republican candidate he starts
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:15.160]  donating exclusively to republicans so i want to take your calls on that at

[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:25.400]  hello hey go ahead you're on yeah yeah i just want to talk about how you know
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:29.880]  sad is that uh conservatives and i used to be one that
[02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:33.800]  you know they believe that they're truly the awakened you know the enlightened
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:37.000]  individuals compared to the democrats in this country
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:42.360]  but they fall for the same you know stuff you know the two party system and
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:46.760]  and the same you know just idiotic candidates that
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:49.560]  could put out there for them every year like nip romney and
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:53.320]  john mccain well i think that happens on both sides on both sides they
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:58.680]  they buy into being a part of this party as if there's something in that identity
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:02.280]  like you know supporting the cowboys or the dolphins or something
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:06.200]  and so they buy into that and they they put blinders on everything i'm surprised
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:09.400]  to see the republicans after everybody complaining about
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:12.600]  obama's background about his birth certificate and everything else and
[02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:15.560]  and there's issues beyond his birth certificate there's the fact that
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:19.480]  his family had these connections to the cia on the one side and on the other
[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:24.840]  side they were connected to this indonesian regime that was backed by the cia
[02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:29.720]  to overthrow that country a a very criminal regime he grew up in that
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:33.640]  country he went to a muslim school how how connected is he to the united states
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:37.960]  even if you don't agree with the commonly understood
[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:41.720]  definition of a natural born citizen how do you feel that this guy's got a
[02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:45.000]  strong connection to united states so you look at all that you look at the
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:48.040]  cons the conservatives who are complaining about that and now we've
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:52.440]  got three candidates if i'm correct counting them correctly got marco rubio
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:57.000]  we got ted cruz we got bobby jindal none of whom would qualify under the
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:00.360]  constitutional definition of a natural born citizen the conservatives are just
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:02.200]  fine with that so i didn't want to interrupt you go
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:06.120]  ahead jd make your make your point
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:09.800]  oh and also yeah you might want to look into uh
[02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:13.640]  who's related to uh to who because that that way you'll know who's going to be
[02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:17.400]  the next president since it seems that everyone in the white house seems to be
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:21.160]  cousins with each other yes absolutely absolutely that
[02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:24.760]  reminds me of the of the report that i keep forgetting to throw
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:28.120]  to let's play this report that i tease at the beginning of the segment
[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:32.360]  president jimmy carter uh talking about his latest book a full life
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:36.600]  reflections at 90 years old president jimmy carter on how the united states
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:41.960]  is an oligarchy let's play that report now it's just an oligarchy with a
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:46.600]  with unlimited political bribery being the essence of getting
[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:50.200]  denominations for president for president or the elected president
[02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:53.400]  and the same thing applies to governors and u.s. senators and
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:57.240]  congress members so now we've just seen a complete
[02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:03.640]  subversion of our political system as a payoff to major contributors who want
[02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:09.400]  and expect and sometimes get uh papers for themselves after the elections over
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:14.360]  absolutely true and we have seen the price of a presidential campaign go up
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:17.400]  exponentially it's amazing how this is exploding
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:20.520]  remember what h.l. minkin said the early part of the 20th century said
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:24.600]  an election is an advanced auction of stolen goods and when you see this
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:27.240]  amount of money being spent on presidential candidates
[02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:30.520]  when they're collecting billions of dollars already hillary clinton has
[02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:34.360]  gotten uh over a hundred million dollars i believe she's raking it in in
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:37.880]  massive amounts and so is jeb bush when you see that happening
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:42.040]  you know that there's going to be a totally controlled
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:45.720]  administration and that's what we're seeing now with the trans-specific
[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:49.960]  partnership and the transatlantic partnership these are
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:53.960]  things that are going to massively reorganize the economy they're going to
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:57.400]  destroy our rights they're going to export our jobs
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:00.920]  it's going to destroy us in so many different ways it's being written by
[02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:04.680]  corporate lawyers in secret we're not even allowed to see it and they have
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:08.120]  completely greased the skids to let this thing go
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:12.120]  straight through was there anything else you want to add jd uh yeah one more
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:15.480]  thing is that uh hillary clinton really is going to be in the ring
[02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:19.480]  people need to uh you know not forget about the whole mean our console
[02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:23.720]  connection and the massive cocaine smuggling for the cia
[02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:27.160]  oh absolutely want to make sure that doesn't get buried and forgotten in the
[02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:30.520]  past absolutely yeah we're we're uh we didn't have
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:33.880]  him on this week but when alexis back he's going to be talking again to
[02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:37.800]  tosh plumley larry nickles uh we're not going to let people forget that thank
[02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:41.400]  you they should not forget that and as camille poglia mentioned we should not
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:46.440]  forget how bill and hillary clinton used their power against working class
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:51.880]  women how dare her talk about the war on women she is the war on women as some
[02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:55.080]  of them have said uh let's go to brad and la brad you
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:59.800]  wanted to talk about trump go ahead yes dave thank you um
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:05.080]  i've been around about 65 years now and i've trump's been in and out of the news
[02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:09.720]  almost uh at least 50 of those years i would say and he's always had a
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:13.640]  reputation somewhat as a kind of a sleazy uh used
[02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:18.120]  card dealer you know who lies straight in your face just to get the
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:24.200]  the dollar or get the deal done and uh i i just pray that uh my american
[02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:29.880]  brothers and sisters avoid the same knee jerk reaction that we had with obama
[02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:36.840]  yeah in voting him in rapidly uh just to get rid of a uh
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:44.040]  an anti-american uh president and in another one other point you know we're
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:49.000]  kind of in a damage control situation here with regard to foreign affairs with
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:53.960]  carries blunders and our uh separation from
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:57.800]  israel and things of that nature who has been a historical
[02:16:57.800 --> 02:17:02.840]  ally of the united states and i don't know that we can afford a loose cannon on
[02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:07.000]  deck you know who gets all temperamental and stuff over just
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:12.040]  minor discussions in a courtroom and let that be the spokesperson for the
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:17.560]  united states i ask please everyone look into the
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:21.800]  backgrounds of every single person that we vote for congresses of a
[02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:26.440]  stigial organ that needs to be removed but uh dave thank you for the
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:30.680]  opportunity to talk thank you so much brad and la i want to go to uh
[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:35.720]  roger in kentucky kevin and florida we got walton michigan many others we've
[02:17:35.720 --> 02:17:37.960]  got uh before we do though we're talking about
[02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:40.840]  trump before we get off of trump i just wanted to read you
[02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:44.520]  one more area with that that came out of this new york time story where they
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:47.000]  went back and they look at the depositions from these lawsuits of course
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.240]  he had the situation that uh brad was just referring to where he lost his
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:55.800]  temper uh with a lawyer who said she needed a short recess to do uh
[02:17:55.800 --> 02:18:00.520]  some breast pumping okay he said you are disgusting and stormed out of the thing
[02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:03.160]  and of course he was also telling people you're lucky that you lost your
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:05.880]  deposits with me if you had bought the home and had actually gone through you
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:09.640]  would have lost even more well there's also questions about what his net
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:12.440]  worth is or questions that came up in these lawsuits was he really paid a
[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:17.560]  million dollars for 2005 speech no an actual alibi it was 400 000 he said
[02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:21.480]  and he said i'm no different from a politician running for office at the
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:25.080]  time he said you always want to put your best foot forward
[02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:28.840]  so what is he telling us right now because right now he is a politician
[02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:32.760]  who's running for office but one of these lawsuits was a defamation lawsuit
[02:18:32.760 --> 02:18:37.880]  where he sued a reporter for talking about how he had inflated assets
[02:18:37.880 --> 02:18:40.920]  so they talked to him about how he arrived at the value of some of his
[02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:43.080]  assets so in this court deposition in
[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:45.960]  new york they said well you had some property
[02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:50.440]  that you were valuing in uh westchester county new york they said
[02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:54.680]  it was worth 80 million dollars one year and then 150 million dollars the next
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:59.560]  they say was it your view of the value of the property that changed from 2005 2006
[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:02.040]  he says yeah the value of that property had gone up
[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:04.680]  substantially they said well did you have an appraisal done he said no i don't
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:07.400]  believe so did you have any basis for that view
[02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:11.880]  other than your own opinion as the lawyer i don't believe so said trump
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:15.160]  and as they point out in the new york times they say that unconventional
[02:19:15.160 --> 02:19:18.760]  approach may raise questions about trump's public
[02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:23.160]  claim that he is now worth more than 10 billion dollars it's a little bit
[02:19:23.160 --> 02:19:26.600]  subjective perhaps i don't know let's go to

[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:39.800]  any different as a matter of fact it was a lot more credible
[02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:44.360]  than the fbi investigations of the terrorists where the fbi comes in
[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:48.200]  and they promote this to these people they equip them they train them they
[02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:51.800]  carry them to the so-called terrorist side and then bust them and say look
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:55.400]  we're keeping you safe that's why we need to listen to everything that you do
[02:24:55.400 --> 02:24:58.760]  and watch everything you do that's why you have the security status so that we
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:02.760]  can do these phony raids and they're all phony folks
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:06.840]  no this was people going in the only thing that they made phony was their own
[02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:09.880]  credentials to say that yeah we are really here's
[02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:13.880]  somebody like stem express we really do want to buy baby parts
[02:25:13.880 --> 02:25:17.240]  and then they videotaped what these people had to say it's very real but we
[02:25:17.240 --> 02:25:20.760]  don't want to talk about that we want the misdirection
[02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:24.680]  obama is the master of misdirection he's the master of headfakes he's the
[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:28.360]  master of the shell game now we have
[02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:32.120]  Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe saying that he wants to extradite
[02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:38.680]  this evil dentist that paid Robert Mugabe $55,000 to do a trophy hunt
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:42.840]  but now they want him back as an example let's listen to the clip
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:46.680]  about Zimbabwe wanting him back they want him extradited let's hear that clip
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:51.400]  i'm very happy that i've been following on facebook
[02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:58.280]  that almost 500,000 people are calling for his extradition
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:03.880]  and we need that support because this is the route that we are taking
[02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:07.480]  is Zimbabwe we are taking the issues very
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:11.480]  seriously as we frantically tried to protect
[02:26:11.480 --> 02:26:16.760]  our wildlife from organized gangs such as this one
[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:20.920]  there are people who command respect in the society
[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:25.640]  such as Dr. Walter James Palmer a well-known dentist
[02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:31.560]  and Theo Bronkhorst an experienced licensed professional hunter who can
[02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:36.920]  connive to undermine Zimbabwe law international laws
[02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:42.120]  and cites regulations pretty high and mighty isn't it
[02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:45.160]  we're going to talk about organized gang let's talk about that marxist
[02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:50.120]  kleptocracy they call Zimbabwe run by this 10-pot dictator
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:54.200]  like Kim Jong-un goes by the name of Robert Mugabe
[02:26:54.200 --> 02:26:58.680]  Walter and michigan you want to talk about Mugabe what's your comment
[02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:02.760]  uh yes uh david i want to point out something
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:08.440]  which is never mentioned about Mugabe Mugabe was raised as a Roman Catholic
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:12.200]  and studied under Jesuits who are the ones who initiated
[02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:17.960]  socialist communism in Paraguay from 1600 to 1756
[02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:22.120]  you read the extreme oath of the Jesuits in a library of Congress card
[02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:27.080]  66-43354 and you'll find out who the socialist
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:30.520]  communists are and Mugabe is one of them and he's a
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:34.760]  double talker and promotes uh making lots of money
[02:27:34.760 --> 02:27:39.160]  his dentist paid him lots of money well who's the richest organization in the
[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:42.440]  world it's a roman catholic church run by a
[02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:47.320]  Jesuit former Jesuit cardinal promoting redistribution of our wealth
[02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:50.040]  well we certainly we certainly do have a pope who has
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:53.080]  you have a pope now who has absolutely nothing to say about these Planned
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:56.200]  Parenthood videos he has nothing to say about the change of
[02:27:56.200 --> 02:28:00.200]  marriage and whatever your position are on those issues isn't it strange
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:03.320]  that he wouldn't talk about any of that but he is pushing
[02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:07.560]  very hard for a global government in order to control
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:12.120]  global warming and the guy that he put on to his scientific advisory council
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:16.920]  Schellenhooper is someone who is not only pushing the nonsense of global
[02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:21.480]  warming but he is pushing for massive depopulation and of course as we
[02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:26.360]  pointed out before the corruption of this kleptocracy the hypocrisy
[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:29.240]  of them saying that they want to see justice done
[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:32.760]  when you've got Robert Mugabe five months ago they they want to make a big
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:36.760]  deal about it this dentist who paid Mugabe to do a trophy hunt
[02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:41.320]  when Mugabe for his birthday was given a lion as a trophy
[02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:45.560]  was given a crocodile as a trophy and as we read at the beginning of the
[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:50.600]  program over a million dollars on his 91st birthday party tens of thousands
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:54.840]  of guests eating exotic animals left and right like a baby
[02:28:54.840 --> 02:28:57.000]  elephant because you know just a regular elephant
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:01.400]  isn't exotic enough they've got to go to a baby elephant
[02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:04.840]  let's go to andy in indiana andy you want to talk about donald trump
[02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:07.720]  we've got just a little bit of time here if it goes a bit long we can hold you
[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:12.200]  after the break go ahead yeah hey david um a couple of
[02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:16.440]  things on trump first of all i like the idea that
[02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:20.920]  his shelf funding his own campaign and not taking donations
[02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:24.040]  i think that that keeps the whole element of special interest
[02:29:24.040 --> 02:29:28.440]  out of his campaign which is huge to me second of all
[02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:32.440]  i lived in palm beach for a long time and we talk about
[02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:35.640]  we don't have time for that we'll get that second point when we come back
[02:29:35.640 --> 02:29:39.480]  yeah it's not an advanced election auction of stolen goods but we have to
[02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:42.920]  ask did he steal the goods before he became rich
[02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:46.120]  is that how he got his money there might be a question about that when you look
[02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:50.760]  at those imminent domain cases visit the art of the steel we're on the march
[02:29:50.760 --> 02:29:57.800]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:03.240]  undercover journalists from the center for medical progress
[02:30:03.240 --> 02:30:06.840]  have revealed that they have nine more planned parenthood videos
[02:30:06.840 --> 02:30:10.280]  in the can the groups founder david eliden said that they have close to
[02:30:10.280 --> 02:30:14.840]  300 hours total of undercover video it was gathered during a 30-month-long
[02:30:14.840 --> 02:30:18.600]  in-depth investigative journalism study of just how planned parenthood
[02:30:18.600 --> 02:30:22.280]  sells the body parts of the babies they abort the leaden adds that
[02:30:22.280 --> 02:30:26.120]  every taping that they did during this project was done in full compliance with
[02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:29.000]  local recording laws but these facts have not prevented the
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:32.120]  los angeles superior court from issuing a temporary
[02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:35.480]  restraining order against cmp barring them from releasing
[02:30:35.480 --> 02:30:38.520]  any more footage of officials working with stem express
[02:30:38.520 --> 02:30:41.720]  planned parenthood is getting increasingly desperate to distract from the
[02:30:41.720 --> 02:30:45.320]  issue of how they sell the body parts of the babies that they abort they've

[02:34:55.320 --> 02:34:59.240]  liked donald trump because he could finance his own campaign i think that's
[02:34:59.240 --> 02:35:02.920]  great too of course there's questions about
[02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:05.880]  how he got his money people are complaining there's been numerous
[02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:08.760]  lawsuits complaining that like many other businesses
[02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:14.840]  uh he has hired illegal aliens he said in the lawsuits that uh
[02:35:14.840 --> 02:35:18.280]  he did not know that they were illegal aliens at the time
[02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:22.760]  how does that make you feel i think david's
[02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:26.760]  i think that for us to have a businessman even in the running
[02:35:26.760 --> 02:35:30.840]  is a great idea like it was with ross perot and i think with any
[02:35:30.840 --> 02:35:35.000]  businessman especially the one at the top it's very difficult
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:41.560]  for him to run a completely clean business especially
[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:45.640]  when you get down to the grass roots of what your business is
[02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:49.720]  knowing exactly what's going on from one operation to the next
[02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:53.080]  so i think if we're dealing with any businessman and we
[02:35:53.080 --> 02:35:57.240]  i in a way i think that for president it would be important for us to have a
[02:35:57.240 --> 02:36:00.920]  businessman at this point and not a politician
[02:36:00.920 --> 02:36:05.720]  but if we have a businessman especially one of the means that doll trump has
[02:36:05.720 --> 02:36:11.320]  you're going to have legality problems you're going to have problems with
[02:36:11.320 --> 02:36:16.360]  immigration somewhere in his system somewhere along the line it's just
[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:19.560]  how it is in american business unfortunately
[02:36:19.560 --> 02:36:23.480]  well and had what is are there about policies that you like of donald trump
[02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:26.280]  i mean is it just the fact that he's a rich businessman that you think is good
[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:29.160]  because i get that feeling from a lot of people and and certainly when he made
[02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:33.240]  his announcement he said look here's my balance sheet i'm very rich you
[02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:36.040]  should vote for me i'm not beholden to anyone and yet
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:40.120]  i think he's doing a lot of deals with people and i kind of wonder if he would
[02:36:40.120 --> 02:36:43.000]  be doing deals if he got a like to president just because
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:46.360]  he's got a lot of money doesn't mean that he doesn't want it anymore one of
[02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:49.960]  the things that i've seen with very very rich people
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:53.720]  do you remember when somebody asked john d rockefeller he was the richest man in
[02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:57.160]  the world at the time the reporter asked him they said mr rockefeller
[02:36:57.160 --> 02:37:01.480]  how much money is enough and he said just a little bit more
[02:37:01.480 --> 02:37:05.640]  my opinion is that the ultra rich see money
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:10.280]  as a drug they can never get enough of it they're addicted to it
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:14.600]  and jesus said the love of money is the root of all evil so
[02:37:14.600 --> 02:37:18.680]  other than his being an extremely rich businessman anyway what is it about his
[02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:22.840]  policies that that attract you
[02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:26.840]  well first of all i'm a ron paul i mean i'm a ron paul and ran paul guy
[02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:31.400]  i'm just you know looking at donald trump as a candidate
[02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:34.840]  and you know playing devil's advocate basically but
[02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:38.680]  you know he did say in his announcement you know in speaking about isis in
[02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:43.640]  iraq you know that he was going to bomb the hell out of them
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:46.040]  and i mean you think that's a good idea you think it's a good idea to bomb the
[02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:49.080]  hell out of iraq
[02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:53.160]  what how does that done for us for the last 10 15 years is that really made us
[02:37:53.160 --> 02:37:57.400]  any safer but you're asking me what he said
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:38:01.800]  and you know that was that was one point yeah i know but i mean you like that you
[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:04.760]  think that's a good idea i'm you know i'm just saying
[02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:08.440]  no i was asking what what i'm asking you what uh
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:11.960]  what policies that you personally think are a good idea
[02:38:11.960 --> 02:38:17.000]  that you would vote for for donald trump i mean is it something beyond
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.640]  a howard bill sticking his head out the window and saying i'm mad as hell and
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:21.800]  i'm not going to take it anymore i understand the frustration
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:25.000]  i'm frustrated i want to understand though what
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:28.040]  these people are about i want to know what their character is about i want to
[02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:31.480]  know what policies they want to put out so what do you see about this that is
[02:38:31.480 --> 02:38:36.440]  attractive to you well at at this point i think what is most
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:39.720]  attractive about donald trump to me is that
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:43.720]  he is calling out these issues that people
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:48.360]  need to think about and can get behind we're still a year
[02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:53.000]  more than a year away from the election and as far as policies go i don't hear
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:56.360]  any of these candidates talking a whole lot about policies
[02:38:56.360 --> 02:39:00.520]  i've heard rand talk about policies i've heard him talk about how we need to
[02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:03.400]  change the surveillance state i've heard him go before
[02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:07.640]  the head of homeland security and say uh you don't have the authority to get a
[02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:11.000]  search warrant from mr and mrs verizon have you ever
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:14.280]  read the constitution do you know that you have to get
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:18.200]  a search warrant that is specific to the person the place the thing that you're
[02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:20.920]  looking for you have to go before a judge you can't go before
[02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:24.040]  a faiza court which is supposed to be for foreign
[02:39:24.040 --> 02:39:27.160]  operation only can't go before a faiza court and say i want to listen to all
[02:39:27.160 --> 02:39:31.400]  the phone calls from mr mrs verizon i've seen him propose a lot of very
[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:35.480]  specific policies and legislation i've seen other candidates propose
[02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:39.160]  specifics that i don't agree with but i haven't really seen much from donald
[02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:41.880]  trump and so that's that's my take on it that's why i asked for people to call on
[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:45.720]  for trump because i haven't seen anything other than him identifying
[02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:49.160]  things that people are very frustrated for they voted for republicans
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:53.160]  in this last election and the republicans immediately thumbed their nose
[02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:57.080]  at the electric and said we're not going to do anything about obama care
[02:39:57.080 --> 02:39:59.320]  we're not going to we're not going to touch that we're not going to do anything
[02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:03.880]  about the immigration system whatsoever
[02:40:03.880 --> 02:40:10.600]  well again and i said i i'm i'm a ran guy i'm you know i'm fully behind ran but
[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:14.120]  as donald trump speaks i think that it's important to
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:18.760]  let him get these issues out there raise a little bit of hell so that
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:23.960]  people can hear the opposition can hear everybody can hear and and have to
[02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:26.680]  address the issues to have him in the debate
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:30.760]  i think would be key regardless of whether he i mean
[02:40:30.760 --> 02:40:34.040]  whether he has policies or not if he's bringing those things up and making
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:36.280]  people talk about it then let's hear what the other
[02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:39.560]  people's policies are regarding this problem so i agree i'd like to see him
[02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:41.960]  in the debate i'm not saying that i definitely would like to see him in the
[02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:44.920]  i would like to see him in the debate but they're
[02:40:44.920 --> 02:40:47.960]  bringing they lowered the levels of the debate so they could bring in
[02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:50.760]  lindsay graham and carlie furan and other people who don't even have one
[02:40:50.760 --> 02:40:54.120]  percent support they changed the rules of the debate
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:57.000]  precisely in my opinion so that they could push
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:01.720]  trump to the side and shut him up there was an article that's
[02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:06.200]  appear people are warning hillard jeb not to
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:10.680]  get involved with uh with trump insiders warn jeb bush this is on
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:14.040]  politico don't engage with trump the old maxima
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:17.560]  applies never wrestle with a pig they say you get dirty besides the pig likes
[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:21.560]  it they want to push trump to the side they don't want to have him
[02:41:21.560 --> 02:41:24.600]  in the debates that's why they're going to have so many people in there besides
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:28.360]  the fact that it's going to be a ratings uh circus the whole thing is a reality
[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:30.840]  tv show circus they don't want to have a serious
[02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:34.040]  discussion i i agree with you andy on that especially
[02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:37.320]  that if he gets in there and he brings up some issues
[02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:42.680]  he'll force them to get out of the usual pat responses that they have but i
[02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:46.360]  think the persons who are really bringing up issues that the others aren't
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:49.160]  talking about are ram paul and to some degree
[02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:52.600]  ted cruz i'm not a ted cruz supporter i don't think he's even qualified to run
[02:41:52.600 --> 02:41:55.320]  for president but at least he'll talk about things like
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:42:00.200]  getting rid of the irs uh and the income tax we need to have that kind of
[02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:03.400]  discussion uh thank you let's let's uh give some other people a chance here
[02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:06.040]  let's go to uh kevin and florida you want to talk about hillary you've been on
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:09.640]  hold for a while go ahead yeah thank you david before i did
[02:42:09.640 --> 02:42:13.160]  my point about hillary what i've seen i just want i've listened to all these
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:18.200]  toddlers i i believe donald trump is dumb and i i honestly believe he is
[02:42:18.200 --> 02:42:21.320]  just a placeholder for jeb bush and hillary clinton
[02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:25.240]  and i don't agree with anything i i totally agree with you saying nobody
[02:42:25.240 --> 02:42:29.320]  believes any policies you believe he's dumb is that what you said
[02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:32.600]  no i just believe he's he's like he's dumb he's like
[02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:36.680]  planned parenthood anything oh yeah yeah yeah okay yeah i think he's a
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:39.880]  a lot of people portray him as as a dark horse
[02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:43.000]  because i like to talk about this like it's a horse race i've said before i
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:46.600]  don't think he's a dark horse i think he's a stalking horse for hillary i
[02:42:46.600 --> 02:42:50.360]  think he's a stalking horse for jeb i mean he's given a lot of money to the
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:55.880]  to the clintons as alex pointed out you know playing the the clip of
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:42:59.880]  carlin saying it's an exclusive club and you're not in it we had
[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:03.880]  jimmy carter talking about how this is an oligarchy it's a it's an advanced
[02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:07.560]  auction of stolen goods i mean all this stuff it's a phony
[02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:11.720]  situation it's going to be playing to the bushes and the clinton's people that
[02:43:11.720 --> 02:43:15.320]  donald trump has been giving money to for a very long time but go ahead talk
[02:43:15.320 --> 02:43:20.360]  about hillary yeah so i live in in florida i live in jacksonville
[02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:23.240]  and um there's some weird stuff going on with
[02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:27.400]  people trying to vote for hillary or get people to donate for hillary so what
[02:43:27.400 --> 02:43:30.280]  they're doing down here is they're setting up
[02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:34.040]  tri stations so they'll find a road that has three
[02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:37.720]  uh red lights or just street lights in close proximity
[02:43:37.720 --> 02:43:42.520]  and they have people stationed at the lights and they have signs that say free
[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:46.360]  cupcakes at one and they'll say free water at another
[02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:51.080]  and then the third one will say uh free car washes and then there's
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:55.000]  where they're doing the car washes it's always a pharmacy and it's always a big
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:58.600]  money pharmacy either a walgreens or a cvs
[02:43:58.600 --> 02:44:02.200]  um i'm sure other places that have red is we don't have them down here
[02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:05.480]  um and there's giant signs that say pledge for change
[02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:11.160]  and i think it's kind of ironic that they're giving away these things
[02:44:11.160 --> 02:44:14.440]  you know trying to get people to change what's going on
[02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:17.640]  why would you give away something you know rand paul doesn't do anything like
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:19.880]  that i think rand paul she's got a lot of money
[02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:23.400]  she's got she's got massive amounts of money and as rand paul pointed out you
[02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:25.640]  know she's taking a lot of money from planned parenthood
[02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:28.840]  so uh don't expect anything to change along that front you're talking about
[02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:33.080]  these ready for hillary signs i i think the the thing that is um
[02:44:33.080 --> 02:44:37.240]  going around the internet the meme ready for oligarchy done the same way as her
[02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:41.400]  so i think that that nails it exactly there was a thing on the onion
[02:44:41.400 --> 02:44:45.160]  about hillary clinton and it was a satire piece that hillary clinton
[02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:48.360]  suspended by the fbc from campaigning for three weeks because she's caught
[02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:51.800]  spitting on staffers i mean these are people who
[02:44:51.800 --> 02:44:56.200]  are kind of leaning towards the left but even they see her absolute and
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:44:59.160]  total arrogance so we had the book from the former
[02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:03.320]  secret service agent talking about how being assigned to protectory clinton
[02:45:03.320 --> 02:45:08.120]  was considered to be a punishment detail this is the way this whole thing
[02:45:08.120 --> 02:45:11.240]  runs i think they just pulled that up there from the onion
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:14.040]  of course there was another funny one from the onion about donald trump that
[02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:17.880]  was absolutely hilarious another satire he tells iowa farmers
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:22.600]  he has 500 cows cows that are 500 times bigger than theirs he told in a symbol
[02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:25.320]  group of dairy farmers your cows are small and scrawny
[02:45:25.320 --> 02:45:29.240]  you should be embarrassed to milk them he said his cows were the size of at least
[02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:32.440]  a dozen Cadillacs and had udders that'll make your head spend no one raises
[02:45:32.440 --> 02:45:35.800]  dairy cows is gigantic or as successful as i do said donald
[02:45:35.800 --> 02:45:39.000]  trump everyone knows that my cattle are my cattle are winners
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:42.600]  you people would be lucky to have them graze here
[02:45:42.600 --> 02:45:47.720]  of course that's satire but it captures exactly the tone of donald trump a man
[02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:52.520]  who as part of a lawsuit deposition would tell the opposing
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:57.400]  attorneys your clients are lucky that they lost their deposits on trump
[02:45:57.400 --> 02:46:00.120]  towers because if they had bought those places that
[02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:03.400]  have lost even more money in 2008 collapsed
[02:46:03.400 --> 02:46:06.840]  i mean that's the kind of attitude of donald trump and it's like i'm scratching
[02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:10.360]  my head trying to figure out what anybody sees in this guy
[02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:15.240]  i i see a casino thug i'm sorry i've seen enough people like that
[02:46:15.240 --> 02:46:17.880]  my wife is from new york i know a lot of people
[02:46:17.880 --> 02:46:21.960]  like donald trump that act exactly like that that act like a thug and i don't
[02:46:21.960 --> 02:46:27.320]  i don't get it at all uh let's go to uh thank you kevin let's go to roger in
[02:46:27.320 --> 02:46:30.680]  kentucky roger you were calling about homeland security something about that
[02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:37.320]  go ahead yeah let me uh let me give you the biggest conspiracy
[02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:43.720]  um that i can um if you go to google type in cdp or
[02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:49.720]  aniston alabama um and there's center for domestic preparedness
[02:46:49.720 --> 02:46:53.720]  um i've talked to alex before about uh sim cards
[02:46:53.720 --> 02:46:58.760]  or similar things being placed in this uh when i was in the service and then i
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:03.560]  served on uh a deployment team for the department of
[02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:08.120]  homeland security and very quickly in most of our
[02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:13.560]  classes we were taught that uh eventually there would be the
[02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:19.000]  need for a short whether that be two five or seven
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:23.640]  year era military state where we along with
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:30.280]  beliefs and military would have to uh assist in controlling the public
[02:47:30.280 --> 02:47:33.800]  because of some outrage whether political
[02:47:33.800 --> 02:47:38.280]  racial um economic different reasons
[02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:45.160]  economic uh but it was always uh this big consortium of who we were gonna work
[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:49.960]  with and in these classes you know we had uh tactical doctors and
[02:47:49.960 --> 02:47:56.280]  tactical paramedics um fire police um
[02:47:56.280 --> 02:47:59.720]  you know everybody that you would come to rely on
[02:47:59.720 --> 02:48:06.440]  or you think would you know turn and and go to civilian way uh being you know
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:10.120]  we were we were taught if they caught it right out
[02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:13.800]  you know we're gonna have these right wing organizations that
[02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:17.480]  are going to be domestic terrorists and because of that
[02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:21.480]  it's going to get so bad that we're going to have to institute
[02:48:21.480 --> 02:48:24.600]  most people would would call it other things but
[02:48:24.600 --> 02:48:32.600]  it would be called a paramilitary uh engagement uh you know not martial law
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:37.960]  paramilitary is what we were told that we would serve they're not going to use
[02:48:37.960 --> 02:48:40.600]  the term martial law there'll be something very specific they would have
[02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:44.120]  to declare that let me ask you roger uh you work for homeland
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:47.480]  security what and and you're concerned about a

[02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:10.680]  who have the potential to become extreme the people who have the
[02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:14.680]  potential to become violent in other words it's kind of a pre-crime scenario

[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:29.720]  report from daily news about the newest study saying that cell phone
[02:54:29.720 --> 02:54:33.240]  radiation can cause cancer this is a meta study
[02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:36.920]  basically a study of hundreds of other studies they say on the daily news
[02:54:36.920 --> 02:54:40.520]  it reveals the findings of many previous researchers and how radio frequency
[02:54:40.520 --> 02:54:43.720]  from your phone can damage your dna the damage can add up
[02:54:43.720 --> 02:54:47.000]  cumulative over a period of time they can cause a variety of health problems
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:50.200]  they say like cancer headaches fatigue even skin
[02:54:50.200 --> 02:54:52.840]  problems for example they say just 20 minutes a day
[02:54:52.840 --> 02:54:56.280]  for five years increase the risk of one type of brain tumor
[02:54:56.280 --> 02:55:02.840]  three fold three fold 300% folks using the phone an hour a day for four years
[02:55:02.840 --> 02:55:09.240]  up the risk of tumors three to five times 300 to 500 percent increase in
[02:55:09.240 --> 02:55:12.920]  tumors if you're going to use a cell phone use it away from your body
[02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:16.840]  use it away from your head don't keep it in your pocket all the time keep it
[02:55:16.840 --> 02:55:19.720]  away from your body the cell phone manufacturers will tell you that
[02:55:19.720 --> 02:55:23.080]  they put that in there as a warning it's simply plausible deniability they will
[02:55:23.080 --> 02:55:25.880]  deny that it has any effect but they'll put it in there as a
[02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:29.320]  warning you've been warned take care of yourself make sure your
[02:55:29.320 --> 02:55:32.200]  children don't do that because they're the ones that are using the phone a
[02:55:32.200 --> 02:55:34.520]  very long time holding it close to their body
[02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:38.520]  let's go back to your phone calls let's go to Gerald in Arkansas Gerald you
[02:55:38.520 --> 02:55:41.240]  want to talk about the elephant in the room was that the one that Mugabe was
[02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:44.120]  the baby elephant that he was eating in the room or is that some Republicans
[02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:46.920]  what is the elephant in the room
[02:55:46.920 --> 02:55:52.920]  so the elephant in the room is the fiat banking system which actually pays for
[02:55:52.920 --> 02:55:55.800]  all this stuff that you've been covering so
[02:55:55.800 --> 02:55:59.320]  the systems is not as important as the cause
[02:55:59.320 --> 02:56:04.520]  which is the fiat banking system because they they own everything by fiat
[02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:08.200]  I mean I talked to my family about this and they don't
[02:56:08.200 --> 02:56:11.800]  get it that you can get on a computer that's what the
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:15.640]  federal reserve does it did you there's no real money
[02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:19.800]  gold and silver is only real money article one sector 10 state
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:23.080]  no state shall make anything in payment of debt except
[02:56:23.080 --> 02:56:26.520]  gold and silver coins absolutely and that was one of the things that was so
[02:56:26.520 --> 02:56:30.280]  important about Ron Paul's campaign he educated so many people
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:33.800]  about the federal reserve the private federal reserve
[02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:37.560]  that manipulates the markets that creates this fiat money that is at the
[02:56:37.560 --> 02:56:40.440]  root of all this and certainly when we look at this
[02:56:40.440 --> 02:56:44.360]  what is it that you have people coming in that running as governors and saying
[02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:47.160]  hey I've managed the budget if you become president you don't need to manage
[02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:49.320]  your budget you don't need a businessman who can manage your
[02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:53.560]  budget to become president it's an open ticket all we do with the
[02:56:53.560 --> 02:56:56.280]  income tax was created about the same time as the private federal reserve
[02:56:56.280 --> 02:56:59.720]  we're just paying the interest on the loan to the federal reserve it's like
[02:56:59.720 --> 02:57:02.840]  a massive reverse mortgage you know the kind of mortgage that you get
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:06.040]  when you're old and you own a house and you say well I don't have any income
[02:57:06.040 --> 02:57:09.480]  so I'm going to get income from the bank each month and when I die they're going
[02:57:09.480 --> 02:57:11.960]  to own the house well you know we're dying as a
[02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:15.880]  republic it's a balloon note at the end of this reverse mortgage and that's
[02:57:15.880 --> 02:57:18.600]  what this whole thing is absolutely I agree with you Gerald and
[02:57:18.600 --> 02:57:21.160]  Arkansas I want to move quickly because other people have been holding for a
[02:57:21.160 --> 02:57:24.200]  long time thank you for pointing that out let's go to Kelly and South Dakota
