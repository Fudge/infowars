[00:00.000 --> 00:07.900]  government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.900 --> 00:31.980]  GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:31.980 --> 00:39.180]  The dollar continues its slide. Gold and, of course, other commodities, like oil,
[00:39.180 --> 00:45.980]  aren't exploding. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. It is Friday, the 27th day of
[00:45.980 --> 00:56.220]  June, 2008. We had Jordan Maxwell on for about two hours and 50 minutes Monday,
[00:56.220 --> 01:00.300]  and listeners really, really enjoyed hearing from him. Thought it was very
[01:00.300 --> 01:05.420]  informative and thought-provoking, so instead of waiting a year or two till the
[01:05.420 --> 01:08.060]  next time we have him back on, as we normally do, we have Jordan on about
[01:08.060 --> 01:12.540]  once a year on average. I thought, why not just go ahead and have Jordan back on
[01:12.540 --> 01:16.300]  today for two hours? The next hour and the hour after that will be all of this.
[01:16.300 --> 01:21.900]  Then, State Rep Charles Key, who's helped expose the fact that Oklahoma City was an
[01:21.900 --> 01:29.260]  inside job, he got passed in the state legislature a clause restating the
[01:29.260 --> 01:32.300]  sovereignty of Oklahoma against the federal government in the New World Order.
[01:32.300 --> 01:40.060]  It passed 90 plus, what was it, 93 to 6? I've got the actual vote here, yeah, 93 to 6.
[01:40.780 --> 01:47.980]  So, he'll be joining us coming up in the final hour today. We'll have open phones
[01:47.980 --> 01:54.620]  with Jordan Maxwell in the second hour with him. First hour, we won't, but in the
[01:54.620 --> 02:01.340]  second hour with Jordan Maxwell, we will have open phones.
[02:02.700 --> 02:05.980]  There's a lot of news here in front of me, a lot of information that we're going
[02:05.980 --> 02:08.700]  to be going over.
[02:09.260 --> 02:15.420]  All of it is extremely important. Every day, the amount of criminal activity by
[02:15.420 --> 02:21.420]  the globalist just increases and the amount of their exposure, the extent to
[02:21.420 --> 02:26.780]  which they are revealed, intensifies.
[02:26.780 --> 02:31.660]  Credit crunch forcing U.S. middle classes to live in their cars.
[02:31.660 --> 02:37.420]  Wall Street plunges towards worse month since the Great Depression.
[02:37.420 --> 02:45.980]  OPEC chief sees oil at $150 to $170 a barrel in the coming months.
[02:45.980 --> 02:53.580]  I'm going to cover this when we get back, but I was tuned in to two different radio shows this morning.
[02:53.580 --> 03:00.220]  One driving over to the office and another one that was on in the office, mainstream radio.
[03:00.220 --> 03:04.700]  And I heard three separate callers,
[03:05.420 --> 03:10.140]  two callers driving in and then a caller in the office just about 10 minutes
[03:10.140 --> 03:17.660]  before I went on air on another show saying that
[03:17.660 --> 03:25.740]  they are very upset with how, well in the last case, the local station, at least
[03:25.740 --> 03:31.260]  for a time, I guess I'm on at 590 a.m., has taken Neil Boards off and has put a
[03:31.260 --> 03:35.340]  local show on, which is fine and dandy. I'm not getting in the middle of that.
[03:35.340 --> 03:41.180]  The point is the woman was saying, oh, I think it's so great that you're not talking about
[03:41.180 --> 03:47.660]  serious subjects. I'm tired of hearing all the bad news. Oh, I'm so glad you've taken him off the air.
[03:48.940 --> 03:53.900]  I think they're just testing a local bunch in there and they're literally talking about stuff
[03:53.900 --> 03:58.460]  like how old should a girl be when she wears makeup? What is your favorite color?
[03:58.460 --> 04:05.580]  How many tickets they got when they were teenagers? Just total puff head.
[04:07.100 --> 04:11.020]  And I was thinking, you know, maybe they don't know what they're doing over there,
[04:11.020 --> 04:15.980]  putting stuff like that on, but maybe they do because that's what I guess the people want.
[04:18.060 --> 04:22.140]  Because I was listening to another syndicated show and heard two callers say the same thing,
[04:22.140 --> 04:29.500]  hey, I wish you wouldn't be so negative. I wish you wouldn't talk about so much negative stuff.
[04:31.100 --> 04:36.380]  You should just choose to say everything's positive. So I want to speak to this mindset.
[04:37.260 --> 04:41.100]  When we get back, it is the mindset that's gotten us where we are.
[04:42.860 --> 04:46.460]  I'm negative about a lot of bad things that are happening because I want them to stop.
[04:46.460 --> 04:52.060]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[05:30.140 --> 05:34.780]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this

[07:52.060 --> 08:05.180]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[08:05.900 --> 08:14.140]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[08:14.140 --> 08:21.260]  So I'm listening to a couple of our talk radio stations this morning
[08:22.460 --> 08:27.340]  and the callers are calling in, even though it's not on topic, saying we don't want to hear about
[08:27.340 --> 08:32.140]  bad things. We don't want to hear about old prices going up. We don't want to hear about
[08:33.500 --> 08:38.860]  potential war with Iran. We don't want to hear negative things. And last night I was scanning
[08:38.860 --> 08:44.700]  around on YouTube, as I always do, and saw a video posted by a young man who said,
[08:44.700 --> 08:51.020]  I listened to Alex for a couple of years and then I just got really depressed and I realized he's
[08:51.020 --> 08:56.220]  just a fearmonger and I choose not to believe his worldview and what he's saying.
[08:59.900 --> 09:04.540]  And that was basically the nature of it. And he also criticized me because we have sponsors.
[09:04.540 --> 09:09.500]  That our stations that we're on have to have sponsors too. And then the network has to
[09:09.500 --> 09:14.860]  have sponsors and I do too. This doesn't happen for free, folks. But again, that's the child
[09:14.860 --> 09:22.380]  likeness of the American people. No connection to reality. And they believe that if they say
[09:24.140 --> 09:27.660]  something isn't true or ignore it, that it will make it be so.
[09:29.260 --> 09:33.900]  Now let's be clear here. I am fighting the New World Order. I am criticizing and trying
[09:33.900 --> 09:41.740]  to expose corruption because I want to save what's left and try to rehabilitate what's been taken
[09:41.740 --> 09:48.380]  over of our free society. We have all these thousands of government documents and think tanks
[09:48.380 --> 09:52.860]  and their own announcements about how they want to have a total control grid and putting in scanners
[09:52.860 --> 09:57.180]  that show your naked body at the airports and children being trained to tattle on their parents
[09:57.180 --> 10:00.460]  and you can't hug or kiss your children or you'll be arrested. That's now going to be
[10:00.460 --> 10:04.060]  pedophilia in England and the U.S. so the state can take control of your lives.
[10:05.420 --> 10:09.500]  And the government is involved in all of these pedophile crimes and all these different homeland
[10:09.500 --> 10:12.940]  security deputy heads have gone to jail for it because local police bust them.
[10:15.580 --> 10:19.900]  And the Dine Corps and Halliburton do run child kidnapping rings and that's mainstream news.
[10:19.900 --> 10:24.220]  They don't get in trouble. I mean, I'm not supposed to expose that. I'm not supposed to talk about
[10:24.220 --> 10:34.540]  how our dollars plunging in value more than a cent a month. There's not many cents left that it can
[10:34.540 --> 10:45.020]  lose. You know what that means? There's the Eau Clochet, the canard of the denial is not a river
[10:45.020 --> 10:55.900]  in North Africa. This is denial. If we do not admit how bad things are, if we do not admit
[10:55.900 --> 11:00.220]  how serious things are, if we do not admit how dire our
[11:02.380 --> 11:09.340]  straits are, then the evil is going to win, ladies and gentlemen. We cannot live in denial.
[11:09.340 --> 11:13.180]  There's this idea that you can just be optimistic about things and that's certainly true in business
[11:13.180 --> 11:18.780]  and life and when you're in college trying to get a date to be optimistic, to be positive,
[11:18.780 --> 11:23.580]  to not just act like you're confident, but to really be confident. And it's certainly
[11:23.580 --> 11:28.460]  good if you're selling people cars or it's good if things like that are at a cocktail party,
[11:28.460 --> 11:36.060]  but it only goes so far. And just, oh, Alex, be positive things aren't that bad. Hey, I wish
[11:36.060 --> 11:42.460]  that I sometimes didn't know 10 years ago that Dincor, Halliburton,
[11:44.300 --> 11:48.780]  the United Nations were running giant child kidnapping rinks. And I would even try to deny
[11:48.780 --> 11:53.020]  it when I'd see it in foreign newspapers and foreign investigations and lawsuits and people
[11:53.020 --> 11:58.460]  going to jail for it overseas. And then it came out in major papers in the US the last four years
[11:58.460 --> 12:06.700]  and was admitted and it was worse than I thought and even brave two governors went public about it
[12:09.580 --> 12:17.580]  and nothing happened. I mean, you better believe every day I wish that wasn't true because that's
[12:17.580 --> 12:24.220]  scary folks to know that people running our government are as evil as it gets. Here's another
[12:24.220 --> 12:29.580]  example. State police guy called in the Midwest yesterday and he said, you know, Alex, I didn't
[12:29.580 --> 12:33.340]  believe you about a lot of this stuff, but now they're getting us ready for federalization
[12:33.340 --> 12:37.340]  training is that we've got to do what the president says in emergencies and putting us
[12:37.340 --> 12:41.420]  through these drills and but see, I didn't have to believe that he was state police. I don't have
[12:41.420 --> 12:45.340]  to believe him even though he sounded credible. I already know it's in the John Warner Defense
[12:45.340 --> 12:49.500]  Authorization Act. I already know it's in the military commissions act. I already know it's
[12:49.500 --> 12:55.100]  in PDD 51. I've had the Congress been on to talk about it. I've played clips of them debating
[12:55.100 --> 12:59.580]  on the House floor. Congress isn't allowed to see it. You're going, well, wait a minute. You said
[12:59.580 --> 13:05.420]  you know it's in it. Just the two page cover sheet says the president is a dictator for any
[13:05.420 --> 13:11.420]  emergency, any emergency, including economic or anything they say is an emergency that the governors
[13:11.420 --> 13:17.420]  are vassals, the state guards, the national guards, the police. The Congress has no authority
[13:17.420 --> 13:21.180]  and Congress said we like to see that full report, that full plan and the White House said you're
[13:21.180 --> 13:26.700]  not allowed to. The highest cleared as high as the president, Homeland Security Committee can't see
[13:26.700 --> 13:34.460]  it. And then they went on the floor and freaked out over it. Now it just so happens they've been
[13:34.460 --> 13:37.980]  expanding this through the executive for decades and I've interviewed Thomas Sanchez, head of
[13:37.980 --> 13:41.820]  emergency management in Kingsville and the chief of police in San Antonio, Ali Philippus of the
[13:41.820 --> 13:46.460]  time and a bunch of other people and we learned in briefings what they were given. It's gun
[13:46.460 --> 13:50.940]  confiscation, it's mass arrests, it's forced inoculations. Now I told you that 10 years ago,
[13:50.940 --> 13:56.860]  11 years ago, now it's in the news. Now I can play you newscast where they're saying yes,
[13:56.860 --> 14:01.980]  we built camps for you. Yes, we've trained preachers to tell you to go to camps. Yes,
[14:01.980 --> 14:06.940]  we're going to forcibly inoculate you. Yes, we're federalizing. Yes, the president's a dictator.
[14:07.900 --> 14:14.060]  Yes. And that means Obama or whoever else comes after him, even if you love George Bush.
[14:14.060 --> 14:20.860]  Don't you understand, we had conventions and rules and laws and still do against that for a reason
[14:23.340 --> 14:29.100]  that powerful, intelligent people throughout history, powerful elites have always tried to
[14:29.100 --> 14:33.420]  get control of governments. Why? Because then you've got the money machines. You've got the
[14:33.420 --> 14:37.740]  military. You've got the power. These are people on power trips. They want power. You know, everybody
[14:37.740 --> 14:43.180]  wants to rule the world. That's just common sense. Everybody knows that or at least they should,
[14:43.180 --> 14:46.700]  but according to some people, they taught us the last 80 years in this nation,
[14:46.700 --> 14:50.620]  nobody wants to rule the world. There's no elites. There's no powerful interest.
[14:52.380 --> 15:02.060]  And I watched this poor young man who thinks I'm the bad guy on YouTube because I get up here and
[15:02.060 --> 15:11.580]  yell and scream about what's happening. Folks, I'm thinking about doing a middle of the night live
[15:11.580 --> 15:17.580]  stream on prisonplanet.tv. People don't believe it that I now wake up almost every night for hours
[15:17.580 --> 15:22.220]  and can't sleep worried about this. I've always been somebody that sleeps like the dead. I woke
[15:22.220 --> 15:30.380]  up at 1.44 last night, been asleep a few hours, no coffee, no nothing. And I laid there in bed in
[15:30.380 --> 15:36.140]  the cool of the night, looking at the shadows on the walls through the window, just thinking about
[15:36.140 --> 15:40.140]  all of this. I thought, why don't I just have a computer by my bed and I'll just start firing it
[15:40.140 --> 15:53.820]  up and going live at 3am, 4am, 2am? Just laying there. I mean, I'm sorry if I can't sleep over this.
[15:55.340 --> 16:03.100]  When you find out that there is a giant industrial, I mean, that means huge, mechanized,
[16:03.100 --> 16:11.500]  oiled with a bureaucracy for kidnapping women and children. When you realize that the government
[16:11.500 --> 16:16.780]  does control the importation of narcotics, when you realize that they do launder the money in
[16:16.780 --> 16:22.140]  their banks, when you realize they are following every form of tyranny, what are you supposed to
[16:22.140 --> 16:27.340]  do? And I hear the poor public saying, we don't want to hear this. I mean, even fake neocon stuff,
[16:27.340 --> 16:32.060]  they don't want to hear about the borders are being overrun and how the, you know, blame,
[16:32.060 --> 16:37.180]  they don't want to hear the false alarmism about the Democrats. No difference, makes no,
[16:37.180 --> 16:45.740]  it's pointless to debate these characters. So, I don't know what I can do for people
[16:46.780 --> 16:50.460]  like that who are living in such denial. I mean, look at these reports I've got.
[16:51.660 --> 16:53.980]  This is in Alex Jones five years ago,
[16:53.980 --> 17:01.580]  because we could see five, six, seven, eight years ago, the Federal Reserve printing money
[17:01.580 --> 17:06.140]  so fast it was going out of style, giving everybody credit, the real assets were being
[17:06.140 --> 17:12.620]  snatched up. Then we read the IMF and World Bank documents in 2002, where they were planning the
[17:12.620 --> 17:30.380]  whole thing. Just amazing. Absolutely amazing. And now I have the headlines
[17:33.020 --> 17:33.820]  here in front of me.
[17:33.820 --> 17:40.700]  Wall Street plunges towards worst month since the Great Depression.
[17:44.460 --> 17:51.340]  There's another one, AP oil reaches $142 a barrel on view dollar will keep falling.
[17:51.980 --> 17:56.700]  Did you hear that? Now you'll see this in Reuters and AP news wires and you might hear it once a
[17:56.700 --> 18:04.380]  month on some talk show on MSNBC or CNBC, but I'm at the grocery store, I'm at church, I'm
[18:04.380 --> 18:09.420]  deep-sea fishing last week with my son, and I'm talking to businessmen and people and they don't
[18:09.420 --> 18:13.260]  know I'm going, the dollar's been devalued and they're like, no, it hadn't, I got money in the
[18:13.260 --> 18:17.740]  bank, I got a piece of land, I got a, I got a business and my money isn't devalued. I'm like,
[18:17.740 --> 18:24.300]  yeah, it is. And they think they can just say, no, it's not devalued and that it changes it.
[18:24.300 --> 18:31.660]  But oh, you're an alarmist, I, and a lot of people in the population think that if you're
[18:31.660 --> 18:37.100]  talking to them, that if you're telling them about bad things that are happening, you're like a
[18:37.100 --> 18:44.460]  showoff, you're doing this to act smart. Somehow they inculcated the population with that view.
[18:44.460 --> 18:48.300]  Man, I'm just trying to get you to wake up hoping together we can put political pressure
[18:48.300 --> 18:52.380]  on the establishment to stop the absolute sacking and gutting of this country forever.
[18:52.380 --> 18:59.180]  Here's another fear mongering issue I try to put out every day. I mean, sodium fluoride does attack
[18:59.180 --> 19:02.540]  your brain and glands and every organ and does hurt you and there's thousands of government
[19:02.540 --> 19:06.620]  and institution and university studies and there's no debating and you can go look them up yourself
[19:06.620 --> 19:11.260]  and I've had neurologist and scientist and everybody else on to cover it and read all the
[19:11.260 --> 19:16.620]  studies and I mean, it's there. You can say it isn't true and slurp your fluoride, but I mean,
[19:17.340 --> 19:20.700]  you can say first they said there wasn't mercury in the shots and they said it was there and good
[19:20.700 --> 19:26.220]  for you. Now they admit it's hurt millions of people. What do they do? They increase it by
[19:26.220 --> 19:32.700]  five times in the shots. I mean, not knowing what's going on will get you hurt real bad.
[19:35.180 --> 19:39.580]  We'll come back and get into Wall Street plunges towards worse months since great
[19:39.580 --> 19:45.020]  depression on early 1930s. Oil reaches $142. A few dollars will keep falling.
[19:45.020 --> 19:49.820]  Just, you can say I'm lying, but I mean, I'm just covering what's happening.
[19:53.340 --> 19:59.180]  Hi, neighbor. This is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force. Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[19:59.980 --> 20:04.940]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately
[20:04.940 --> 20:10.620]  to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible. When the dollar
[20:10.620 --> 20:16.780]  and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left, when the quarantine
[20:16.780 --> 20:22.380]  and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our
[20:22.380 --> 20:27.020]  own supply of food and enough of it. But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't
[20:27.020 --> 20:31.740]  waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food
[20:31.740 --> 20:39.020]  supply. Decide it's food now or probably never, but can you afford to be wrong? Decide now.
[20:39.020 --> 20:47.740]  Place your bet. Can you afford to be wrong? Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[20:48.300 --> 20:51.100]  Call 800-409-5633.
[20:53.660 --> 21:01.660]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[21:01.660 --> 21:13.420]  world government. For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of
[21:13.420 --> 21:19.020]  the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[21:21.900 --> 21:27.420]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[21:27.420 --> 21:31.180]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[21:31.180 --> 21:35.020]  Bill Bergus is making great progress for the world government. Most people have no idea.
[21:35.020 --> 21:38.380]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their

[21:52.460 --> 21:57.740]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right? First, I get the best parking space
[21:57.740 --> 22:03.740]  at work. Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel, and today I gave a killer presentation
[22:03.740 --> 22:09.180]  in Sydney, finalized the contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston, online
[22:09.180 --> 22:14.380]  from my desk with WebEx. WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[22:14.380 --> 22:18.540]  I just talk to clients on the phone, and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their
[22:18.540 --> 22:23.020]  desktop so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[24:24.940 --> 24:37.740]  But we're not supposed to talk about that. Well, people stopped getting offended by
[24:37.740 --> 24:49.820]  cops bossing them around. I mean, we began to just listen to all the lies, accept cameras on
[24:49.820 --> 24:55.820]  every corner, accept open borders, accept corruption. We stopped looking into things.
[24:55.820 --> 25:00.700]  We just said, hey, life's good. Everything's fine. And a bunch of powerful interests came in here
[25:00.700 --> 25:06.540]  and they set up regional boards. They recruited the establishment, the bankers, the media heads.
[25:06.540 --> 25:10.940]  They all share power with each other. They intensify their power. And a couple thousand people,
[25:10.940 --> 25:15.260]  as the Washington Post reports, the super class, are taking this country down.
[25:15.260 --> 25:17.900]  It isn't enough for them to have trillions of dollars. It isn't enough for them to have
[25:17.900 --> 25:24.220]  incredible power. They want it all. They want to use this as a war machine to invade other countries.
[25:24.780 --> 25:30.060]  They are capturing the United States because politically, the people don't want to be a
[25:30.060 --> 25:37.020]  imperial war engine. Who said that? Zbigniew Brzezinski in his last two books. One published 2007.
[25:37.020 --> 25:43.260]  One published 1998. Grand Chesport, one of them. He said we need terror attacks to get them to go
[25:43.260 --> 25:48.220]  along with us. We need to have huge events, catastrophic large numbers of dead citizens
[25:48.220 --> 25:54.620]  to unify them around a war for world government. Who else says that? The PNAC documents written
[25:54.620 --> 25:58.780]  by Dick Cheney. Who else says that? Syndicated columnist and internal White House memos and
[25:58.780 --> 26:05.340]  Republican national conference memos. National committee memos and state memos. And now McCain's
[26:05.340 --> 26:10.300]  advisor comes out Monday and says, another terror attack would sure help us. People say,
[26:10.300 --> 26:14.460]  why would the government stage an attack? Why would this cabal stage an attack? They're telling
[26:14.460 --> 26:21.020]  you they get power and control out of it. And I'm telling you, whether it's McCain or Obama
[26:21.020 --> 26:26.940]  that gets into office, you're going to have an inaugural bombing. You're going to have a big
[26:26.940 --> 26:34.620]  event, folks. It could be a cratered city, a third of Chicago gone or Dallas or New York or Los Angeles
[26:34.620 --> 26:42.380]  or San Francisco. They've got to bring you to heal and they will do it. They're ruthless. That's
[26:42.380 --> 26:46.540]  why they're in control. Do you know what it means, yuppies, when you keep laughing and saying the
[26:46.540 --> 26:51.740]  dollar isn't devalued? That means your savings, your stocks, everything is being devalued that's
[26:51.740 --> 26:57.260]  denominated in dollars. That means everybody else who you're in business with is being hurt by this.
[26:57.260 --> 27:02.700]  That means all the cost of basically everything we buy and sell are massively increased because
[27:02.700 --> 27:09.580]  of dollar devaluation. Do you understand what that means? And I've been saying for the last
[27:09.580 --> 27:13.900]  seven years since they started devaluing the dollar that it was a red level crisis and you
[27:13.900 --> 27:18.700]  laugh and you still laugh and say, I am a fair monger. Well, you know what? It's pretty much
[27:18.700 --> 27:24.060]  too late now and it's not my fault what's happened and I did the best I could to warn you and what
[27:24.060 --> 27:29.340]  did I get for it? I got hated for it. You want somebody to lie to you? There's plenty of them
[27:29.340 --> 27:35.820]  to do that. Go find them. Go have them tell you everything's wonderful. That's like if your pipes
[27:35.820 --> 27:38.940]  have busted and you're walking around your house while you're in two feet of water and it's ruining
[27:38.940 --> 27:45.100]  your furniture and carpet and everything else and grandma's watercolors on the wall are getting
[27:45.100 --> 27:50.860]  ruined and you go negative. There's no water in here. I choose to be positive and I'm not going
[27:50.860 --> 27:54.700]  to fear monger. Instead of getting the pipes fixed, getting the water turned off at the street,
[27:56.140 --> 27:59.500]  you'll let it run out in the street and ruin your house and let the floor cave in and the
[27:59.500 --> 28:05.260]  ceiling cave in. I mean that literally that's what you do. I don't understand it and then I'm bad.
[28:07.340 --> 28:14.620]  I can't properly express how bad it is. Okay, you understand? The human chimpanzee crosses,
[28:14.620 --> 28:21.660]  they declassified. They had five years ago. Human bovine, human spider, human rat. This
[28:21.660 --> 28:29.340]  isn't funny. Not just for humanity and what it means but the fact of the mega viruses by crossing
[28:29.340 --> 28:36.860]  different zoological creatures with almost sapien sapien. Oil reaches $142 on viewed dollar will
[28:36.860 --> 28:42.860]  keep falling. Oil futures climb briefly to a new record above $142 a barrel Friday on expectations
[28:42.860 --> 28:48.780]  that the weakening dollar, a major factor in crude stratospheric rise will expand its decline and
[28:48.780 --> 28:56.220]  add to oil's appeal. And then it says here, that's the AP. Here's the UK Daily Mail. How dare them
[28:56.220 --> 29:01.180]  fear monger? They're just now having to admit to you what's happening and that means they've
[29:01.180 --> 29:05.500]  decided to give up the ghost as Bob Chapman said. Usually they just lie about all this. Oh my god,
[29:05.500 --> 29:10.860]  this is bad. I mean the fact that this is all over at least the news wires on our news. You know,
[29:10.860 --> 29:14.780]  they don't tell the drooling slaves this but people who actually read news wires they're telling us.
[29:15.660 --> 29:20.940]  Wall Street plunges towards worse months since the Great Depression on early 1930s. I'm going to
[29:20.940 --> 29:27.020]  cover this when we get back. And I'm totally freaked out. You understand how leveraged into debt
[29:27.020 --> 29:33.420]  we are. You realize what's going to happen. War in the streets. This will make 1933 look like
[29:33.420 --> 29:40.780]  choir practice, my god. And you think it's funny, yuppies. It isn't funny.
[29:43.900 --> 29:50.620]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:53.900 --> 29:59.260]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, loose change, final cut, in-game blueprint
[29:59.260 --> 30:04.380]  for global enslavement, the true story of the Bilderberg group, the late great USA, America,

[33:15.180 --> 33:25.340]  gotta cut you down. Sooner or later, gotta cut you down. Go tell that long-tongue liar. Go and tell
[33:25.340 --> 33:32.780]  that midnight writer. Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter. Tell him that God's gonna
[33:32.780 --> 33:39.740]  cut him down. Tell him that God's gonna cut him down. We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[33:41.500 --> 33:46.780]  Well, my goodness, traces, let me tell you the news. It is Friday. I've been with with the midnight
[33:46.780 --> 34:03.580]  dude. 27th of June, 2008. Jordan Maxwell joins us next hour, live on this Friday. Then state rep
[34:03.580 --> 34:09.020]  Charles Key, no, he's not exposing Oklahoma City as an inside job. He'll be doing that too for an hour.
[34:11.260 --> 34:13.900]  He is going to be on the show to talk about how they've passed a law
[34:13.900 --> 34:18.300]  to secede from the New World Order because that's now what the federal government is.
[34:18.300 --> 34:23.820]  We'll tell you about that coming up. It is big news. 90 plus percent of the legislature
[34:24.700 --> 34:28.140]  went to pass that. Finishing up with this important news story,
[34:28.780 --> 34:35.020]  Wall Street plunges towards worse month since the Great Depression on the early 1930s.
[34:35.580 --> 34:40.620]  This is how 1930s started. It started with about a year of the markets racing up and down, up and
[34:40.620 --> 34:47.660]  down, up and down. And with the credit crisis, which the private banks created, and that's now
[34:47.660 --> 34:51.420]  been admitted and their own documents have been released, that they organized it. They had to
[34:51.420 --> 34:56.860]  bring everything down to nothing to buy up most of the country. This is another shearing to the bone.
[34:57.580 --> 35:02.380]  Shares plunged on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday because of fears over oil, inflation,
[35:02.380 --> 35:11.580]  the global economy, inflation in every commodity. Corn, wheat, oil, natural gas, silver, gold,
[35:12.460 --> 35:22.060]  copper, palladium. In London, the FTSE 100 slump 2.6 percent are 147.9 points to 5518.2.
[35:22.060 --> 35:27.100]  Meanwhile, in America, the Dow Jones fell more than 350 points to its lowest level since
[35:27.100 --> 35:31.900]  October 1, 2006. It is now, of course, be the worst June performance since the Great Depression
[35:31.900 --> 35:42.620]  in the early 1930s. And it goes on, so they're panicking. I don't know if it's going to implode
[35:42.620 --> 35:49.740]  this year, next year, two years from now. The point is that the fundamentals have never been this bad
[35:49.740 --> 35:56.780]  with the amount of leverage debt, the amount of derivatives. It's over $600 trillion. It is insane.
[35:56.780 --> 36:03.180]  And all the big boys are buying mountain of doubts with private security firms and getting out of
[36:03.180 --> 36:07.740]  the country, getting out of Israel. I don't ask yourselves why. I don't know, getting out of
[36:07.740 --> 36:15.180]  the U.S., getting out of Israel. They are... God knows what they're going to do to this country.
[36:16.380 --> 36:23.100]  Maybe this won't happen. Maybe it'll pull out. But the chances are it's going to be very,
[36:23.100 --> 36:27.100]  very bad. How bad it is is the question. I mean, it's already bad. And this is only the
[36:27.660 --> 36:31.820]  leading edge of a storm that gets much more intense. I wanted to bring Steve Shankon,
[36:31.820 --> 36:35.820]  because he had been on this in about a month. And Steve is the oldest continually operating
[36:35.820 --> 36:39.660]  storeable foods company in the nation. And he's a great guy. I've gotten food from him now. What
[36:39.660 --> 36:44.620]  is it? Four or five times. And then I get it and give it to family. I keep some for myself. And it
[36:44.620 --> 36:48.220]  isn't because I'm living in fear. It's because I'm living in a greater level of control than
[36:48.220 --> 36:52.540]  general public. If everything goes to hell in a handbasket, I've got a couple of year food supply.
[36:52.540 --> 36:59.180]  And millions went hungry. It was just a university study last month showing that eight million people
[36:59.180 --> 37:04.300]  starved to death. And then they got sick. And then that was marked on their death certificate.
[37:04.300 --> 37:08.540]  Because when they got... Both people who died in Africa, it's not starvation. It's just they
[37:08.540 --> 37:15.100]  get real weak. And then something kills them. Eight million people can pull that up. But the
[37:15.100 --> 37:19.180]  point is, I'm not saying any of that's going to happen. It's just that I have a responsibility.
[37:19.180 --> 37:25.580]  Some paper insurance policy can go up in smoke. But storeable food is something that won't and
[37:25.580 --> 37:31.420]  something I've got. Steve, thanks for coming on with us. It's good to be with you, Alex, again.
[37:32.060 --> 37:37.820]  And it's interesting that you commented on how bad Wall Street is right now. This is only the end
[37:37.820 --> 37:44.860]  of June. All of the problems that we were expecting back at the beginning of the year, Alex,
[37:44.860 --> 37:52.540]  we were expecting to hit heavy duty in September. We are a full three months ahead of schedule
[37:53.580 --> 37:58.860]  in terms of those of us that were tracking this. And I know that you're right at the
[37:58.860 --> 38:04.220]  leading edge of that. You've done a masterful job of tracking what's happening in the country.
[38:04.780 --> 38:14.620]  And the fact is, you mentioned what's going on with the gasoline and the
[38:14.620 --> 38:20.220]  fuel issues. Right now, in the rest of the world, they're screaming nothing. They're not even talking
[38:20.220 --> 38:27.180]  about gas. They're talking about food, food, food, food, food. Right here in our country,
[38:27.180 --> 38:33.740]  what we've got, all of your listeners know that gas prices are just absolutely going nuts.
[38:33.740 --> 38:38.620]  And there is no end in sight. And the crop was bad because of a lot of rain that flooded the
[38:38.620 --> 38:42.780]  Midwest last year. Now it happened again. I wanted to ask you, does that intensify things?
[38:42.780 --> 38:51.180]  Oh, immeasurably, I flew from Florida to Chicago a day before yesterday. And for an hour and a
[38:51.180 --> 38:57.420]  half at roughly, what, 300 and some odd miles an hour, I was looking down at nothing but a great
[38:57.420 --> 39:03.260]  big ocean that had a few islands in it. It is absolutely huge. They say over five million acres
[39:03.820 --> 39:12.060]  and the main corn crop areas. And here's the, here's the, you are used to exposing really dumb
[39:12.060 --> 39:19.420]  things, but we've got to give the dumber than a box of rocks award to the EPA and the US Department
[39:19.420 --> 39:26.540]  of Agriculture because right now they are debating whether to allow farmers to pay $75 an acre to
[39:26.540 --> 39:33.340]  put land back into production. And they're doing that on June 22nd. They started that,
[39:33.340 --> 39:38.540]  which means that even if they do put that land into production, they will not get a crop this year.
[39:38.540 --> 39:44.860]  And one of the things that we're finding out, remember, you and I have talked about China
[39:45.420 --> 39:49.900]  and many of us have wondered what they're going to do with that $1.3 trillion that
[39:49.900 --> 39:56.060]  they have. Well, now we know, they are going around the world buying land and they are going
[39:56.060 --> 40:02.940]  around the world buying food at four times the ask price right now. They're buying futures
[40:02.940 --> 40:08.780]  at four times the ask price right now. They've got the money to do it and that means that there
[40:08.780 --> 40:15.180]  is going to be no food very soon. Now, with regard to the gas prices, what happens when
[40:15.180 --> 40:19.980]  you run out of money and you can't afford the gas, you can park your car and you can stop traveling,
[40:19.980 --> 40:25.580]  that is happening, Alex. That is happening. Are you kidding? I mean, I see five times as many
[40:25.580 --> 40:30.700]  moped's and motorcycles now out on the roads, buzzing around like wasps everywhere, little
[40:30.700 --> 40:35.340]  vespas and things and people I know are selling their cars, even small cars, and getting them.
[40:36.780 --> 40:40.060]  Again, a lot of people who are well off say, oh, I don't care. Well, that's going to affect your
[40:40.060 --> 40:46.300]  business. In fact, here is the UK Daily Mail. The scared mood on the trading floors came amid fears
[40:46.300 --> 40:50.140]  that soaring energy prices will push up inflation and the road consumer spending
[40:50.140 --> 40:55.100]  dramatically reducing company profits. You see, this goes across all lines.
[40:55.100 --> 41:02.700]  Yeah, it does. But the problem is that what happens if you run out of gas, you don't travel.
[41:04.140 --> 41:11.020]  If you run out of food, which is the subject that nobody is talking about that that much
[41:11.020 --> 41:16.300]  in the country. However, all the investors, all of the money, Alex, is going into food.
[41:16.300 --> 41:21.740]  They're buying up food like crazy. They're buying up farmland. They're buying up equipment.
[41:21.740 --> 41:27.660]  They're doing everything they can because the investors know that the real issue is not gas,
[41:27.660 --> 41:34.540]  not fuel. The real issue is food. Because you see, if you can't afford the food, as many Americans
[41:34.540 --> 41:39.820]  already with the inflation that we've had already, Alex, many Americans, we're getting emails all
[41:39.820 --> 41:45.900]  the time at eFoodsDirect.com that are telling us, hey, we can't afford food now. How are we supposed
[41:45.900 --> 41:50.540]  to put in food ahead? So we've made some adjustments in what we're telling folks.
[41:50.540 --> 41:56.060]  It used to be, up until a few weeks ago, that we said, what you need to do is set aside some money.
[41:56.060 --> 42:00.140]  And we did some calculations. You know that food that you got from eFoodsDirect?
[42:01.900 --> 42:10.060]  We calculated what's going on. Do you realize, Alex, that families can get this year's food
[42:10.060 --> 42:17.740]  at half the cost of last year's groceries right now? If they buy bulk food, which by the way,
[42:17.740 --> 42:24.700]  it turns out it's superfood. We've done some comparisons on the one-year supplies, and particularly
[42:24.700 --> 42:30.860]  this two-month grab-and-go thing, which I really need to tell you about. But this stuff is actually
[42:30.860 --> 42:37.820]  superfood. It's got big taste. It's extremely healthy. It's extremely easy to fix. And the cost,
[42:37.820 --> 42:44.300]  like I say, is running at half the cost of last year's groceries. Well, I would just add that
[42:44.300 --> 42:50.700]  because it's freeze-dried or dehydrated, it also fits in very small cans compared to the amount
[42:50.700 --> 42:56.060]  that it would be in store-bought stuff. So it's also very, very portable. And that's important as well.
[42:57.180 --> 43:02.940]  Well, it really is. And the thing that I needed to mention, and you and I haven't talked that
[43:02.940 --> 43:09.020]  much about it, but we've got hurricane season coming up. And right now, with all the weird
[43:09.020 --> 43:15.580]  weather worldwide, people can't help but notice this, with all of the weird conditions with
[43:15.580 --> 43:21.820]  transportation, with the threat of possibly quarantines, with all of the stuff we've got
[43:21.820 --> 43:27.420]  coming at us, this little, what I'd like to have all of your listeners to do is get up on
[43:27.420 --> 43:35.420]  eFoodsDirect.com and take a look at the two-month grab-and-go kit. This is 200 meals. And literally
[43:35.420 --> 43:39.900]  what we've got right now, Roger, with the high price of food, we've got a lot of families
[43:40.540 --> 43:45.740]  that are actually eating this right now because they can put in top quality meals,
[43:45.740 --> 43:53.740]  extremely nutritious stuff at half the cost of last year's groceries. So one of these packs that
[43:53.740 --> 44:00.380]  feeds a person two months, three good square meals a day plus an additional 20 meals,
[44:00.380 --> 44:05.660]  is going to cost them about $5.25 a day. Homeless people can't get by on that.
[44:06.540 --> 44:10.780]  And well, that's what they get by going to you, you know, the folks that actually get the food
[44:10.780 --> 44:15.180]  and prepare it and put it in the cans. Give them the phone number if they also want to call. A lot
[44:15.180 --> 44:20.220]  of my listeners, probably 30%, aren't on the internet, or a lot of others would rather just
[44:20.220 --> 44:23.180]  call. How do they call eFoodsDirect? The J. Michael Stevens group.
[44:23.180 --> 44:36.300]  Just go 800-409-5633. That's 800-409-5633. And the main thing that every family should have
[44:36.860 --> 44:42.220]  in their trunk, these little two month grab-and-go things, they come in two cases.
[44:42.940 --> 44:47.100]  The meals are already there. The quick fix. Yeah, it's two white boxes. A lot of folks in
[44:47.100 --> 44:51.260]  the office have gotten that. We've got a few of those here at the office. Just to have here,
[44:51.260 --> 44:55.340]  it's something I really believe in, and it's a great deal. Again, eFoodsDirect,
[44:55.340 --> 44:59.820]  there's big banners up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com. I really can't miss it.
[44:59.820 --> 45:05.660]  eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com, just an E, and then foodsdirect.com.
[45:06.220 --> 45:08.780]  And given that number again, Steve, I want people to call the number.
[45:08.780 --> 45:23.900]  It's 800-409-5633. Anybody that is in the way of this potential storm area,
[45:23.900 --> 45:29.340]  we're into the hurricane season. Anybody? Oh, hey, the people in the middle of this country,
[45:29.340 --> 45:36.300]  Alex, if we could talk to them three months ago and said, hey, you probably need some sort of an
[45:36.300 --> 45:43.420]  emergency evacuation kit or something that you can live on for a couple months until a disaster
[45:43.420 --> 45:47.180]  disappears, they just thought we were half a bubble off with one or in the water. Well, here's
[45:47.180 --> 45:51.660]  the deal. The feds have spent billions, and I mean, billions the last seven years,
[45:51.660 --> 45:56.860]  six and a half years putting huge billboards up saying, get ready, have a five-day food supply.
[45:56.860 --> 46:01.420]  They're just doing that so they can claim they warned us. They know they're messing with the
[46:01.420 --> 46:04.780]  weather, and I've had the father weather weapons on. They are messing with it, folks,
[46:04.780 --> 46:09.340]  with antennas and with spraying, and they now admit that they've been doing it, but they say
[46:09.340 --> 46:15.740]  it's for own good. They're involved in just all sorts of behavior, but look, Steve, my main reason
[46:15.740 --> 46:21.180]  for having horrible food is the economics. I mean, I know that there is a food shortage worldwide
[46:21.180 --> 46:26.220]  because of bad weather, but you compound to that all the speculators racing around because the
[46:26.220 --> 46:30.940]  dollar is going in the toilet, and so every commodity is exploding, and so you're right,
[46:30.940 --> 46:35.660]  these foreigners that have better currencies than us, Americans can't compete for the food we grow
[46:35.660 --> 46:40.380]  now, and so a lot of staple items are going to have already exploded in price. You'll still be
[46:40.380 --> 46:44.140]  able to, I guess, fill your belly up on some of the side things, but that could potentially
[46:44.140 --> 46:48.700]  run low as well. The whole point is, is that during the depression, this is why I believe
[46:48.700 --> 46:52.300]  people should get horrible food, regardless of what happens, and I don't know what's going to
[46:52.300 --> 46:58.540]  happen. I hope everything's fine, but bottom line, the economics, if you have 90% or 85%
[46:58.540 --> 47:03.900]  living on the farms, being self-sufficient in the 1930s, it's now 90% in the cities,
[47:03.900 --> 47:08.700]  of the 10% on the farms, only half are self-sufficient. Most of the farms, people just live on them,
[47:08.700 --> 47:14.300]  and maybe have a horse or cow or two, and they drive in to work at the coal plant or work at
[47:14.300 --> 47:22.540]  the prison, they're not self-sufficient, and so, and not just not having food, like you said,
[47:22.540 --> 47:27.340]  I talk to people out in the country when the swan man comes through, the swan man's told us when
[47:27.340 --> 47:31.580]  we're out on our farm that they're cutting back their route and that people aren't buying their
[47:31.580 --> 47:36.700]  food anymore after 40 years of going out there with a swan truck that delivers food to your house,
[47:36.700 --> 47:44.220]  so the people are just running out of money, and it's just amazing. Folks, you need to call
[47:44.220 --> 47:50.220]  Steve Shink, you need to get horrible food. Steve, if they just want a catalog, or they just want
[47:50.220 --> 47:54.540]  to check out the website, EatFoodsDirect.com, but what about folks that don't have internet
[47:54.540 --> 47:59.180]  and just want to get a basic rundown of what you've got? Well, what they do is they call
[47:59.180 --> 48:06.780]  800-409-5633, and we send them out a whole packet. It's got a couple of CDs of some seminars that
[48:06.780 --> 48:13.980]  I've done, and it also lists what's in there. This comparison is just phenomenal, where you can
[48:13.980 --> 48:19.900]  literally put in a whole year supply of food this year at half the cost of your groceries from last
[48:19.900 --> 48:24.540]  year. You know, that's something that's key to add. You're saying you've got DVDs and audios and things
[48:24.540 --> 48:29.500]  for people that want them. Yep, absolutely. They come out with the packet that they asked for,
[48:29.500 --> 48:35.900]  so ask for the dog on thing, get some information. Those of you that have website access, get up
[48:35.900 --> 48:43.820]  on EatFoodsDirect.com, we've posted, Alex, about 200 articles that will fill people in on exactly
[48:43.820 --> 48:50.860]  what's happening. Oh, I see it. This is so real. It is so real that it's almost unbelievable
[48:51.660 --> 48:56.940]  how real it is. I know that most of your listeners or a lot of your listeners are sitting out there
[48:56.940 --> 49:04.060]  saying, it can't be that bad. Honest. It really is, and even if you can't stand me, I know I
[49:04.060 --> 49:08.460]  get pretty obnoxious. Alex has kind of come and cool and collected doggy. Oh, yeah, right.
[49:08.460 --> 49:15.180]  That's what I said. But even if you can't stand me for Pete's sake, get food, even if you don't
[49:15.180 --> 49:19.020]  get it from EatFoodsDirect. Just look at our warning so you don't get some bad people.
[49:19.020 --> 49:26.220]  Well, bottom line, can people get that packet free? Oh, absolutely. We send it out free. Oh,
[49:26.220 --> 49:32.220]  and here's something that they've got to know. Pay close attention. As folks have called in and we
[49:32.220 --> 49:38.460]  tell them that we're shipping out these one-year supplies. It has a one-week shipping time.
[49:38.460 --> 49:42.220]  There are food companies out there that are talking about three and four months before
[49:42.220 --> 49:46.220]  they can get the back orders, and they will not be able to fill the back orders. No, listen,
[49:46.220 --> 49:49.580]  we've been approached by a lot of their food companies, but I'll go to their website. It'll
[49:49.580 --> 49:54.220]  say six weeks for delivery. I don't want to get involved in that, where even if they supposedly
[49:54.220 --> 49:57.980]  got good food, they can't deliver for six, eight weeks. People are asking me where it's at.
[49:57.980 --> 50:02.780]  Yeah, Steve Shank, it comes in just a few weeks every time I've ordered. Okay, give them that
[50:02.780 --> 50:07.100]  number again for people who want to call and get the free packet, bare minimum, with the CD and DVD.
[50:08.060 --> 50:19.100]  800-409-5633. 800-409-5633. And on the two-month grab and go, Alex, it's next day shipment.
[50:20.540 --> 50:25.420]  Absolutely, folks. Again, in the last more than 10 years, it's good to have it regardless. It's
[50:25.420 --> 50:29.020]  great insurance. Everybody needs to have it. Thank you so much for spending time with us, Steve.
[50:29.740 --> 50:33.820]  Take care, Alex. There goes Steve Shank, folks. Great people, high quality, clean,
[50:35.020 --> 50:41.100]  non-GMO food, eFoodsDirect.com. Okay, we're going to come back in more to the financial news,
[50:41.100 --> 50:45.980]  and then we're scheduled to have Jordan Maxwell on with us, and then Congressman Charles Key,
[50:45.980 --> 50:47.900]  big show lined up in the next three hours.
[50:47.900 --> 51:02.380]  Another untold story here it comes. Another untold story here it comes.
[51:04.060 --> 51:11.500]  Another untold story that you have not been told from. Another untoldstory.com.
[51:11.500 --> 51:20.140]  Victory is secret. Have you begun to wonder what it is, or shall we say what they are?
[51:20.140 --> 51:27.020]  On previous another untold story broadcast, we'd mentioned the first two suspected secrets.
[51:27.020 --> 51:34.540]  But frankly, we hesitate to mention the third suspected secret. It's just too unbelievable.
[51:34.540 --> 51:39.500]  It seems like it's out of a science fiction story. Ever heard the expression,
[51:39.500 --> 51:46.620]  truth is stranger than fiction? Ever think maybe science fiction is told so that when you discover
[51:46.620 --> 51:53.260]  truth, you cannot believe it because it sounds like fiction? How many science fiction stories
[51:53.260 --> 52:00.940]  have you heard, read, or seen where aliens look like people? Lots. But what if it were true,
[52:00.940 --> 52:06.620]  and you heard it? Well, you couldn't believe it because it sounds like fiction. That only
[52:06.620 --> 52:14.300]  happens in the movies. There is told of a prophecy in the greatest storybook written of, and I quote,
[52:14.300 --> 52:21.500]  I will make them jealous with those who are not a people. End quote. People. Could this be part of

[54:05.420 --> 54:18.860]  All those Drifters days are past me now.
[54:18.860 --> 54:43.740]  We were young and strong, but we were still running against the wind.
[54:49.900 --> 54:56.300]  Against the wind. And the New World Order is running against the wind.
[54:59.740 --> 55:02.300]  Their evil will be punished. Their tyranny will fall.
[55:05.420 --> 55:08.140]  Their system is destined from its foundations to fall.
[55:09.820 --> 55:15.340]  Continuing here with the news, oil reaches $142 on view. Dollar will keep falling.
[55:15.340 --> 55:24.700]  And then an insane story out of the London Telegraph. These are the real big financial papers.
[55:25.500 --> 55:29.500]  You notice when Brent Scrocoff, former National Security Advisor, top globalist,
[55:30.700 --> 55:37.180]  wanted to talk bad about Bush and say he was being handled by the Israelis into World War III,
[55:37.180 --> 55:43.580]  he wrote his letter to the Financial Times of London. That's the true paper of record globally.
[55:43.580 --> 55:47.500]  It's not the Wall Street Journal. It is not the New York Times. But a similar paper,
[55:47.500 --> 55:53.740]  the London Telegraph today, Barclays warns of financial storm as Federal Reserve's credibility
[55:53.740 --> 55:59.820]  crumbles. When they start talking like that, it means they're going to pin it on the Federal Reserve.
[55:59.820 --> 56:05.420]  And from the beginning of Bernanke, though I love him, he's a puppet himself, and he's going to have
[56:05.420 --> 56:11.180]  it all pinned on him. While all these fools hail the private Federal Reserve former chieftain,
[56:11.180 --> 56:16.060]  Alan Greenspan, when it was his actions that destroyed the dollar deliberately.
[56:17.100 --> 56:21.180]  See, these things are delayed. Bernanke's been in for a year and a half, almost two years.
[56:23.500 --> 56:27.260]  U.S. Central Bank accused of unleashing an inflation shock that will rock
[56:27.260 --> 56:37.420]  financial markets, reports Ambrose Evans-Pritchard. And that's it. It is a, how did the Fed release
[56:37.420 --> 56:44.700]  a inflation bomb? By issuing basically unlimited credit to their buddies.
[56:45.660 --> 56:51.260]  See, a shadow of all of their looting is giving loans to people that didn't have jobs and didn't
[56:51.260 --> 56:57.900]  have credit. That's a small part of this. They gave it to other corporations and companies to buy
[56:57.900 --> 57:03.420]  up real assets. Then they sell those to other assets, to other companies that they hold,
[57:03.420 --> 57:08.300]  and then blow out and bankrupt the dummy front company. Basically that's been done millions of
[57:08.300 --> 57:13.100]  times upon millions of times by their financial infrastructure, and they are designing all of
[57:13.100 --> 57:19.180]  this to leave us holding the bag. That's what you're not going to read in the Times of London,
[57:19.180 --> 57:22.300]  the Sunday Times of London, the Financial Times, the London Telegraph.
[57:23.980 --> 57:29.980]  Barclays Capital has advised clients to batten down the hatches for a worldwide financial
[57:29.980 --> 57:36.140]  storm. Oh, I thought the last storm was six months ago. Warning that the U.S. Federal Reserve has
[57:36.140 --> 57:44.140]  allowed the inflation genie out of the bottle and let its credibility fall below zero. We're
[57:44.140 --> 57:50.620]  in a nasty environment, said Tim Bond, the Bank Chief Equity Strategist. There is an inflation
[57:50.620 --> 58:01.740]  shock underway. This is going to be very negative for financial assets. We are going to
[58:01.740 --> 58:09.420]  tortoise mood, and we are re-entering into our shell. Investors will do well if they can preserve
[58:09.420 --> 58:17.180]  their wealth. Investors will do well if they can preserve their wealth. We'll come back,
[58:17.180 --> 58:22.860]  finish up on the financials, then we'll talk about his running and all with our guest, Jordan Maxwell.
[58:22.860 --> 58:27.500]  It's not Monday, it's Friday, it's a new live interview. Coming up, tell everybody you know,

[58:41.340 --> 58:47.820]  Our beloved republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national
[58:47.820 --> 58:52.620]  sovereignty worldwide. But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope. The first time in modern
[58:52.620 --> 58:57.420]  history, the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate
[58:57.420 --> 59:01.820]  their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan. We have a short time frame to
[59:01.820 --> 59:07.260]  fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat. In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a

[1:00:15.020 --> 1:00:19.660]  Daily Mail headline. Wall Street plunges towards worse months since Great Depression.
[1:00:20.540 --> 1:00:23.260]  Of the early 1930s on inflation worries.
[1:00:25.260 --> 1:00:29.820]  London Telegraph reports U.S. Central Bank accused of unleashing an inflation shock
[1:00:29.820 --> 1:00:34.380]  that will rock financial markets, reports Ambrose Evans-Britchers. Barclays Capable
[1:00:34.380 --> 1:00:40.620]  has advised clients to batten down the hatches for a worldwide financial storm, warning that U.S.
[1:00:40.620 --> 1:00:47.020]  Federal Reserve has allowed the inflation genie out of the bottle and let its credibility fall to zero.
[1:00:48.460 --> 1:00:52.620]  We're in a nasty environment, said Tim Bond. Barclays is about as respected as it gets, folks.
[1:00:52.620 --> 1:00:56.140]  The bank's chief equity strategist. There is an inflation shock underway.
[1:00:56.140 --> 1:01:03.420]  This is going to be very negative for financial assets. And we're going into the tortoise mode
[1:01:04.540 --> 1:01:11.180]  and are retreating into our shell. Quote, investors will do well if they can preserve their wealth.
[1:01:12.540 --> 1:01:17.500]  You hear that? You will do well if you can preserve it. Preserve it. Wealth, preservation.
[1:01:17.500 --> 1:01:21.180]  This is the London Telegraph today. Headline up on PrismPlanet.com.
[1:01:21.180 --> 1:01:26.700]  Barclays Capable said it's closely watched global outlook that U.S. headline inflation
[1:01:27.340 --> 1:01:31.100]  would massively expand in August and the Fed will have to raise interest rates
[1:01:31.100 --> 1:01:36.860]  six times by the end of the year to prevent a wage spiral. Give it hastens. The bond markets
[1:01:36.860 --> 1:01:41.660]  will take matters into their own hands. This is the first test for banks in 30 years that they will
[1:01:41.660 --> 1:01:48.940]  have to fulfill it. They have zero credibility and the Fed is negative if that's possible.
[1:01:48.940 --> 1:01:56.220]  It has lost all credibility, Mr. Bond said. Let me read you this again. Chief strategist for
[1:01:57.660 --> 1:02:04.380]  and chief equity strategist for Barclays. Let me read that to you again. Investors will do well
[1:02:04.380 --> 1:02:08.780]  if they can preserve their wealth. I'm only having Ted on for two minutes. He literally
[1:02:08.780 --> 1:02:13.260]  is giving you these gold deals at cost. Ted, I think makes like two, three percent to pay his
[1:02:13.260 --> 1:02:17.660]  brokers and just get the order out the door. And he's doing this to introduce you to real
[1:02:17.660 --> 1:02:23.180]  metals and to protection. Now, Bloomberg and everybody else are saying it's going to go up
[1:02:23.180 --> 1:02:28.460]  to 5,000 an ounce. I'm not saying that. Gold's way up again today. And this is the summer. We've
[1:02:28.460 --> 1:02:35.660]  never seen this. So wait till the fall. Now is the time to buy. And it is shooting up right now,
[1:02:35.660 --> 1:02:42.620]  but Ted has it at the price it was two days ago. Ted, A, can you hold the Swiss franc through the
[1:02:42.620 --> 1:02:46.780]  weekend? I told you I would and I'm going to even if I have to take a loss, which it kind of looks
[1:02:46.780 --> 1:02:51.260]  like I will, but I would suggest that everybody gets involved in the precious metals at this time.
[1:02:51.260 --> 1:02:55.660]  Hand writing is on the wall. It's boiling right now. All the financial analysts are saying the
[1:02:55.660 --> 1:03:01.420]  same thing. Just like you said, you better get moving on it. I do. I have those. Franks right
[1:03:01.420 --> 1:03:07.820]  now are currently at $194 apiece. That is a steal, especially with gold prices now where they are.
[1:03:07.820 --> 1:03:13.100]  Now, 243 for the British sovereign coin. Again, that's the same price I offered them for when
[1:03:13.100 --> 1:03:21.740]  gold was at 88, three days ago with you. Right now, those roles of walking liberties are, again,
[1:03:21.740 --> 1:03:30.140]  just a steal at 182 per roll of 20. Preservation of capital. I mean, finally, they're waking up and
[1:03:30.140 --> 1:03:35.420]  saying it. We should have been preserving our capital three years ago. And this is, you know,
[1:03:35.420 --> 1:03:39.980]  we'll be lucky just to be able to hold on to what we have. And that is going to accelerate the snowball
[1:03:39.980 --> 1:03:44.140]  all this bad news. I can't believe they're telling the truth. I mean, I have AP saying the same thing
[1:03:44.140 --> 1:03:51.500]  today. Give them the number to have people need to call now. Yeah, it's 1-800-686-2237. Again,
[1:03:51.500 --> 1:03:59.100]  it's 1-800-686-2237. The numbers are, you know, people are calling like crazy. Get your orders in.
[1:03:59.100 --> 1:04:03.260]  We'll get these things out the door to you real fast. You'll have them in your hand and you'll be
[1:04:04.620 --> 1:04:09.180]  putting off an economic storm here that's coming. We already have the thunder clouds. They're like
[1:04:09.180 --> 1:04:14.060]  just rolling overhead right now. There's no reason not to get into this stuff. Well, I mean, even
[1:04:14.060 --> 1:04:17.980]  if gold isn't going to explode, which clearly the experts are all saying it is, the question is,
[1:04:17.980 --> 1:04:24.380]  will it be 2,500 or 5,000 in the next two years? And this could boil up any time, folks. We're
[1:04:24.380 --> 1:04:29.340]  sitting on top of a bunch of nitroglycerin with a topless dancer dancing around in spiked heels
[1:04:29.340 --> 1:04:33.500]  on top of it on the table. Well, I mean, what if the financial institutions you have your
[1:04:33.500 --> 1:04:37.500]  investments in fail? I mean, just think of that right there. Or let me say somebody's beating
[1:04:37.500 --> 1:04:43.660]  on a bottle of nitroglycerin with a hammer. 800-686-2237. There'll be brokers there all weekend
[1:04:43.660 --> 1:04:49.580]  until midnight every night. 800-686-2237. Thanks, Ted. Thanks, Helen. You bet. We'll be right back.
[1:04:51.260 --> 1:04:55.660]  If you're a chocolate lover, then now you can use chocolate to get the healthy body you've

[1:05:52.060 --> 1:05:58.700]  Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force. Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck. If you knew what I
[1:05:58.700 --> 1:06:03.340]  know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately to put every
[1:06:03.340 --> 1:06:08.460]  effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible. When the dollar and
[1:06:08.460 --> 1:06:14.460]  economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left, when the quarantine
[1:06:14.460 --> 1:06:20.060]  and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our
[1:06:20.060 --> 1:06:24.700]  own supply of food and enough of it. But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't
[1:06:24.700 --> 1:06:29.420]  waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food
[1:06:29.420 --> 1:06:37.020]  supply. Decide it's food now or probably never, but can you afford to be wrong? Decide now. Place

[1:06:48.780 --> 1:06:56.540]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future,
[1:06:57.340 --> 1:07:02.220]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the Builder Bird.
[1:07:03.260 --> 1:07:08.620]  But their objective being world domination. For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:07:09.260 --> 1:07:15.260]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:07:15.260 --> 1:07:23.500]  of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government
[1:07:23.500 --> 1:07:28.860]  is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:07:28.860 --> 1:07:32.620]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea.

[1:07:52.060 --> 1:07:58.620]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:07:58.620 --> 1:08:01.820]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:08:01.820 --> 1:08:11.260]  For the next hour and 55 minutes roughly, Jordan Maxwell is our guest. We had him on Monday for
[1:08:11.260 --> 1:08:15.340]  close to three hours and people really loved it and I thought, why wait? Why not have Jordan
[1:08:15.340 --> 1:08:21.820]  back up on the show? Now this hour we're just going to talk about whatever issues he wants to discuss
[1:08:21.820 --> 1:08:26.700]  and in the next hour we're going to open the phones up for Jordan Maxwell here on the GCN
[1:08:26.700 --> 1:08:33.580]  radio network. Don't forget my new film, Truth Rising is coming out next July 4th. That's next

[1:08:51.660 --> 1:08:56.140]  It is the history of the 9-11 Truth Movement. We are changed, confronting all these globalists,
[1:08:56.140 --> 1:09:00.460]  taking over their media events and showing on the first responders were poisoned by the dust
[1:09:00.460 --> 1:09:05.340]  how the government knowingly covered it up and then their quest to get treatment. Very important
[1:09:05.340 --> 1:09:09.980]  film, cinema verite. I'm like any film I've ever made. I'm very proud of Truth Rising available
[1:09:09.980 --> 1:09:20.540]  right now at infowars.com or by calling 888-253-3139. Jordan Maxwell.com is the website. Jordan,
[1:09:20.540 --> 1:09:25.340]  did you get a big response when you came on the show Monday? Oh, did I ever? Yeah. Thank you very
[1:09:25.340 --> 1:09:31.420]  much for that. Just tremendous outpouring and I appreciate everybody. That was one of the things
[1:09:31.420 --> 1:09:38.220]  I wanted to say that I cannot get back to everyone who has emailed and called me because I just
[1:09:38.780 --> 1:09:44.860]  inundated with emails but I really appreciate everybody and everything that everyone has
[1:09:44.860 --> 1:09:49.980]  been saying so I thank everybody for that. You were telling me during the break that it may have
[1:09:49.980 --> 1:09:54.380]  been the biggest response you've ever gotten right here? Yeah, it very well could be the biggest
[1:09:54.380 --> 1:10:01.100]  response I've ever received because you know and my website I guess went down about three different
[1:10:01.100 --> 1:10:07.260]  times and my webman is very good at taking care of those problems but he just couldn't keep up
[1:10:07.260 --> 1:10:13.180]  with it because it kept going down and so we've had to go to a new server you know that can take
[1:10:13.180 --> 1:10:18.780]  that kind of a hit because I got a tremendous amount of hits on the web on the you know on the
[1:10:18.780 --> 1:10:24.700]  website so hopefully that won't happen anymore and of course I've had problems with you know with
[1:10:24.700 --> 1:10:32.620]  actually being shut down by NSA and security police have shut my site down on occasions and
[1:10:32.620 --> 1:10:40.380]  really destroyed my email but that was done you know a few years ago back in 2005 so I think the
[1:10:40.380 --> 1:10:45.740]  problems I had with your program was the fact that it just had so many hits so I think that's
[1:10:45.740 --> 1:10:52.540]  been taking care of we got a bigger server now. Good, good Jordan I want you in the next hour
[1:10:52.540 --> 1:10:57.740]  and 50 minutes to talk about any subjects you want but I and first do that but I want to get
[1:10:57.740 --> 1:11:02.780]  more into the globalist master plan more of what drives them what the world will look like if they
[1:11:02.780 --> 1:11:08.620]  have their way expand on your 50 years of research you're saying that you believe they are trying to
[1:11:08.620 --> 1:11:14.220]  mutate humanity and now they even say that in declassified documents two species so I want to
[1:11:14.220 --> 1:11:20.220]  get into that as soon as possible and then you know the more into the teutonic system and the
[1:11:20.220 --> 1:11:26.460]  rest of it but first off anything Jordan Maxwell wants to talk about anything you think's important
[1:11:26.460 --> 1:11:30.860]  that this huge audience needs to hear. Well I appreciate that I really thank you for the
[1:11:30.860 --> 1:11:35.580]  opportunity of getting some things off my chest that's been bothering me for a long time.
[1:11:37.100 --> 1:11:43.580]  First of all I got a lot of phone calls and emails from people who say I sent you an email
[1:11:43.580 --> 1:11:50.460]  and you didn't answer I called you but you didn't call me back you know I get anywhere from 50 to
[1:11:50.460 --> 1:11:58.380]  60 phone calls a day and I get like two or three hundred emails a day every day so it's like 1500
[1:11:58.380 --> 1:12:04.940]  a week I live by myself with my brother in two rooms and I don't have a secretary I don't have
[1:12:04.940 --> 1:12:15.100]  uh you know a big uh background of people to help me get out emails and you know correspond
[1:12:15.100 --> 1:12:20.540]  with people it's just me by myself I don't have a secretary I don't have anybody to answer emails
[1:12:20.540 --> 1:12:25.500]  and I'm almost 70 years old I don't type to start with and I don't know that much about
[1:12:25.500 --> 1:12:30.860]  computers to begin with so and then I get a lot of people saying well did you get this email that
[1:12:30.860 --> 1:12:37.660]  did you get this uh picturized that uh yeah I get I get tons of stuff every day continually
[1:12:38.300 --> 1:12:43.100]  but I don't have the ability to get back to everyone well because you brought this up let me
[1:12:43.100 --> 1:12:47.740]  say something about it because this is one of the few uh you you know areas where we can
[1:12:47.740 --> 1:12:53.340]  you know say we've experienced the exact same thing people will get mad yeah I know I get
[1:12:53.340 --> 1:12:59.500]  thousands of emails a day that I don't respond and uh they want a personal relationship with you and
[1:12:59.500 --> 1:13:04.060]  then they become your enemy because you can't respond and they need to realize and be adults
[1:13:04.700 --> 1:13:09.420]  that Jordan does read what you're sending and does look at it but he barely has time for that at
[1:13:09.420 --> 1:13:14.940]  least I mean I'm speaking for you but in my case somebody looks at it somebody reads it but but
[1:13:14.940 --> 1:13:20.540]  there's so much of it that that we could never respond to it all unless it was an automatic
[1:13:20.540 --> 1:13:27.260]  you know response email back and that's what the politicians do uh so and Jordan's a sensitive nice
[1:13:27.260 --> 1:13:31.500]  intelligent fella and I can tell it hurts his feelings when that happens but I'm you know the
[1:13:31.500 --> 1:13:37.020]  public is getting more and more crass myself included no doubt about it less and less gentlemanly
[1:13:37.020 --> 1:13:41.820]  you're very gentlemanly I'm probably not to some extent you know we're becoming more and more ogre
[1:13:41.820 --> 1:13:46.940]  like and so a gentleman like you I think you know it's it's it's it's frustrating but you just got
[1:13:46.940 --> 1:13:52.060]  to get a thicker skin Jordan because you know it's not going to stop well I know I know I try and
[1:13:52.060 --> 1:13:57.420]  answer everybody but uh like I said most people don't know and I don't mind putting myself on the
[1:13:57.420 --> 1:14:02.700]  line and and you know I'm not trying to present myself to the world as anything but who I am
[1:14:03.260 --> 1:14:09.100]  I I live with my brother in two rooms with no shower I you know I just live by myself I don't
[1:14:09.100 --> 1:14:15.260]  have anybody here to help me do anything and I've been very very sick for a long time my
[1:14:15.260 --> 1:14:21.340]  brother is even sicker than I am and so I get you know like I said hundreds of emails a day from
[1:14:21.340 --> 1:14:27.020]  all over the world and another thing is that people email me but they don't tell me where
[1:14:27.020 --> 1:14:32.540]  they are emailing from I don't want a particular address but I would like to know what country
[1:14:32.540 --> 1:14:37.580]  or what state or what city because I get emails from all over the world but you know it could be
[1:14:37.580 --> 1:14:44.620]  from down the street or it could be in South Africa I don't know and so I would like to know
[1:14:44.620 --> 1:14:50.140]  where emails are coming from and I like for people to know that I read everything I sit here for
[1:14:50.140 --> 1:14:55.660]  hours and go through all the emails and on occasions I'll even answer them if I feel it's
[1:14:55.660 --> 1:15:02.780]  important and I that I do that I'll try and answer them but you know hundreds of day with no help
[1:15:02.780 --> 1:15:07.900]  it's just very difficult and yes I get people actually threatening that we all and here's
[1:15:07.900 --> 1:15:15.100]  another problem people will take go out and buy a video of mine and then they reproduce it and
[1:15:15.100 --> 1:15:21.260]  put it out on the market under a different name and and begins selling it all over the world
[1:15:21.820 --> 1:15:26.780]  and then I get emails and phone calls and people say where is the product I ordered
[1:15:27.420 --> 1:15:31.100]  we're going to report you to the authorities we're going to report you to a better business
[1:15:31.100 --> 1:15:37.580]  yeah we have that all the time is is that that's the nature of all this where people mail in bootleg
[1:15:37.580 --> 1:15:42.700]  copies of my films demanding more copies or something but Jordan again I mean I'm happy
[1:15:42.700 --> 1:15:46.860]  to air all this here on air but I just don't think you know I mean it's kind of like the Dutch boy
[1:15:46.860 --> 1:15:51.660]  trying to hold back the flood yeah I think you're right I know it just bothers me terrible but
[1:15:51.660 --> 1:15:58.060]  that people assume that I don't care and just assume that I I am not answering them and one
[1:15:58.060 --> 1:16:03.260]  one guy wrote me and said you're obviously not answering me because I have a Jewish last name
[1:16:03.900 --> 1:16:10.700]  I mean that's ludicrous and so uh you know I'm just voicing my concern of course on the other
[1:16:10.700 --> 1:16:17.100]  hand I want to also talk about the fact of what I believe about God because Lord knows there's so
[1:16:17.100 --> 1:16:24.700]  much out there a pro and con about me concerning my my faith um first of all I am not anti God
[1:16:24.700 --> 1:16:33.100]  I'm not anti Christ I'm not anti anything I have a highest of respect for what we would refer to as
[1:16:33.100 --> 1:16:41.020]  God um I believe and what I my belief about God is that there is a very powerful divine spirit
[1:16:41.020 --> 1:16:49.980]  in the universe and that spirit is wise intelligent and powerful and I have the highest of respect
[1:16:49.980 --> 1:16:58.780]  and honor for the superior spirit in the universe so in that way I have a very high regard for God
[1:16:58.780 --> 1:17:06.220]  and for truth and for spirit uh you know but I'm also intellectually aware that God is simply a word
[1:17:06.220 --> 1:17:12.940]  in English that can be translated different ways and and God is like I always say God
[1:17:12.940 --> 1:17:18.220]  is simply dog spell backwards and then men claim that they own that thing called God and then
[1:17:18.220 --> 1:17:22.700]  claim you've got to follow them and make themselves God and I see that everywhere they claim you're
[1:17:22.700 --> 1:17:26.620]  an atheist they claim you believe in this that and I know Jordan Maxwell have interviewed him many
[1:17:26.620 --> 1:17:31.660]  times uh and read and seen his work and that's not what he's saying he's saying that what you're
[1:17:31.660 --> 1:17:37.340]  told is Christianity what you're told of these different religions is really just a repackaging
[1:17:37.340 --> 1:17:43.980]  of this uh mystery school that's exactly right and consequently I I have the highest of regard for
[1:17:43.980 --> 1:17:52.060]  and I've got over 40 Bibles and on on the you know I'm in my collection I've I've I'm a student
[1:17:52.060 --> 1:17:59.980]  of theology I've loved theology especially the New Testament and I believe that the bible
[1:17:59.980 --> 1:18:06.860]  especially the New Testament is just jam packed with wisdom and knowledge and understanding
[1:18:07.420 --> 1:18:13.900]  I have no problem with anything that Jesus is reputed to have said or is recorded to have said
[1:18:13.900 --> 1:18:21.740]  I live by those principles all I'm saying is that there is a whole world of a cult or hidden
[1:18:21.740 --> 1:18:28.780]  knowledge which uh most people are not privy to even know exist which I have studied all of my
[1:18:28.780 --> 1:18:35.100]  life and so I I I look at things differently I look at where it was written what culture
[1:18:35.660 --> 1:18:42.220]  wrote it where it originally came from the uh etymology of the words so I have the highest
[1:18:42.220 --> 1:18:48.780]  of regard for spirituality and for what is written in the bible the words of Jesus I live by those
[1:18:48.780 --> 1:18:55.740]  principles so I'm not anti god I'm not anti uh symmetric you want to tell people that outside
[1:18:55.740 --> 1:19:02.460]  of baptist church uh steeple is a phallic symbol and is of course and is not worshipping the god
[1:19:02.460 --> 1:19:07.420]  you're told that's exactly right and those and most of those most of those masonic preachers
[1:19:07.420 --> 1:19:12.060]  know that and it's a big joke to them isn't it jordan it is it is and I've stopped with I've
[1:19:12.060 --> 1:19:18.860]  sat with rabbis I've sat with priests I've sat because that's what I do and and I'm sitting with all
[1:19:18.860 --> 1:19:25.260]  of these people who are major names and theology and religion and research and they all smile say
[1:19:25.260 --> 1:19:30.300]  yeah I know yeah I know well but you know the people need something so we just tell them what
[1:19:30.300 --> 1:19:36.700]  they want to hear and uh I've just amazed with that I said why don't you tell them the truth
[1:19:36.700 --> 1:19:43.420]  that's even more startling and they said the people don't want the truth the people want to hear
[1:19:43.420 --> 1:19:47.980]  what they want to hear jordan maxwell stay there well they ride back in just one moment

[1:25:10.620 --> 1:25:16.220]  waging war on humanity uh jordan maxwell there's so much to talk about where where should we start
[1:25:16.220 --> 1:25:22.780]  trying to give you unlock minds and and explain to people the nature of what we face well you know
[1:25:22.780 --> 1:25:27.740]  let me go on with some of what we were already talking about people will write me and call and
[1:25:27.740 --> 1:25:33.820]  say where can i get information on this subject of that subject when it's sitting right there on my
[1:25:33.820 --> 1:25:39.580]  on my website sitting right there on the subject that they're looking for i go into in detail
[1:25:39.580 --> 1:25:46.860]  and one of the research boxes are on the links or the ebooks that are on my website because
[1:25:46.860 --> 1:25:52.460]  i don't put things but most people are babies now they want to be spoon fed things i know i know
[1:25:52.460 --> 1:25:58.060]  and it's just very very depressing to me because there's so many people out there that need to
[1:25:59.020 --> 1:26:05.020]  educate themselves and and i have to stop and go back you know how many phone calls and emails i
[1:26:05.020 --> 1:26:10.780]  get from people who oh uh i asked them i said well did you go on my website they say yes
[1:26:11.740 --> 1:26:17.820]  and i said what did you see uh the stuff on the links and they said no no we didn't see any links
[1:26:17.820 --> 1:26:23.340]  well did you go to the research uh boxes all the boxes on research all the different subjects
[1:26:23.900 --> 1:26:30.780]  uh no we didn't see that i said what did you go to the uh the pictures of the or the audio video
[1:26:30.780 --> 1:26:37.100]  page on my no we didn't see any audio video so then i usually end up asking well tell you what
[1:26:37.100 --> 1:26:42.620]  why don't you tell me what you did see because you obviously haven't looked at anything you
[1:26:42.620 --> 1:26:47.820]  haven't seen anything on my website you just see the the homepage and then you call and ask me
[1:26:47.820 --> 1:26:51.900]  questions which are sitting right there on my website well jordan i mean people just want to
[1:26:51.900 --> 1:26:56.140]  talk to you i know that's what it is they want to be able to say they talked to jordan but i'm
[1:26:56.140 --> 1:27:02.300]  67 years old and very sick and i and i don't have time to sit and talk to one person at a time
[1:27:02.300 --> 1:27:09.900]  the six billion on the earth i'd like for people to go to my website and go through all of it all of
[1:27:09.900 --> 1:27:17.820]  the boxes of materials and all of the like uh words to research i got tons of words on there that
[1:27:17.820 --> 1:27:23.900]  are very important i don't put stuff on my website just to fill out space i'll put it on there because
[1:27:23.900 --> 1:27:29.740]  it's part of my personal research and things which i consider to be very important so i'll put it on
[1:27:29.740 --> 1:27:35.980]  my website and then i have to sit and talk with people explain to them well go on my website
[1:27:35.980 --> 1:27:41.740]  and hit this button and what button that button there that says research and then i have to sit
[1:27:41.740 --> 1:27:45.980]  there for five minutes and wait for them to figure out what the word research means and then they
[1:27:45.980 --> 1:27:51.180]  can go on so i will spend hours on a phone with somebody from the in the middle of nowhere
[1:27:51.180 --> 1:27:58.220]  here trying to show them how to do research how to read and how to think well the it's just it's
[1:27:58.220 --> 1:28:01.900]  just incredible well the architects have done a great job at teaching people how to not think but
[1:28:01.900 --> 1:28:06.940]  at least at least they're groping in the dark starting to try to learn well i know i know but
[1:28:06.940 --> 1:28:13.020]  it's very difficult for someone who's old and sick and tired and been doing it for 48 years and i'm

[1:34:40.220 --> 1:34:47.500]  these all have answers and jordan maxwell is a great researcher into all of that
[1:34:48.140 --> 1:34:56.140]  we'll talk about the esoteric operation the the the matrix like world that we're living in
[1:34:56.140 --> 1:35:01.180]  you know that's a good place to start before we get into the courts there's so many facets
[1:35:01.180 --> 1:35:08.380]  to this and the history of this and where all this began but jordan taking 9 11 all you know
[1:35:08.380 --> 1:35:13.900]  the two towers the masonic meaning of that the date 9 11 people pointed out hundreds of different
[1:35:13.900 --> 1:35:20.220]  esoteric things that happened there but with so many other historical events they're going to have
[1:35:20.220 --> 1:35:28.700]  the olympics on 888 and started at 888 you know hitler and all the occultism he was into the
[1:35:28.700 --> 1:35:34.140]  elites are totally into the occult and they just carry forward all these ancient symbols so i think
[1:35:34.140 --> 1:35:41.100]  a good place to you know throw it at you his uh 9 11 all the esoterica there well yeah the 888
[1:35:41.100 --> 1:35:48.780]  is a numerical uh equivalent for the for the messiah for jesus uh the messianic number is 888
[1:35:49.420 --> 1:35:56.300]  that has to do with the uh the new order of uh of civilization um you know
[1:35:57.420 --> 1:36:01.900]  god i there's just so much to talk about in relation to the esoteric and secret
[1:36:01.900 --> 1:36:10.540]  symbolism i mean for instance in the uh ancient uh he brewin in the ancient semitic world the number
[1:36:10.540 --> 1:36:17.900]  eight was a number for new beginnings to begin things new uh was the number eight of course if
[1:36:17.900 --> 1:36:24.140]  you lay the eight down on its side it becomes the the symbol for infinity because eight is the only
[1:36:24.140 --> 1:36:30.460]  number that you can continue to write without lifting your pen from the from the paper eight is
[1:36:30.460 --> 1:36:36.540]  a number that goes into infinity you never have to you know lift your pen from the paper to write
[1:36:36.540 --> 1:36:41.980]  eight and so lay it down on its side it becomes infinity it's eating itself too it's yeah yeah
[1:36:41.980 --> 1:36:48.460]  and so consequently eight was the number of a new beginnings are continuing to begin anew and
[1:36:48.460 --> 1:36:54.940]  course 13 the the unlucky number of 13 the reason why it's unlucky because it's a divine number
[1:36:54.940 --> 1:37:03.020]  because it has to do with jesus and his followers his 12 followers so the master with his 12
[1:37:03.020 --> 1:37:11.740]  followers it makes 13 and so consequently we have the the number 13 being the perfect
[1:37:11.740 --> 1:37:18.620]  perfect number in ancient mythology the perfect number for government 13 because it's a heavenly
[1:37:18.620 --> 1:37:24.380]  number jesus uh with his 12 making the new government of the world and then we see the
[1:37:24.380 --> 1:37:29.900]  night's Templars getting uh slaughtered on Friday the 13th that's exactly right and so
[1:37:29.900 --> 1:37:35.580]  what i'm saying is that the most uh the night's Templars in the masonic orders realized that
[1:37:35.580 --> 1:37:42.460]  they had to uh if they were going to do this revolt against the old order in europe they wanted it
[1:37:42.460 --> 1:37:49.660]  uh to match the masonic symbolism of numbers numerology of course one of the books in the
[1:37:49.660 --> 1:37:59.260]  bibles called numbers and so they had to have their their revolution in 1776 because one and
[1:37:59.260 --> 1:38:06.140]  seven is eight and seven and six is 13 i'm glad you bring that up we have the um
[1:38:07.020 --> 1:38:12.220]  illuminati supposedly being founded in engels dot university 1776 launching its operation
[1:38:12.220 --> 1:38:17.100]  overthrow europe simultaneously you have it starting here in the united states was our
[1:38:17.100 --> 1:38:23.820]  revolution started by the same people or did they try to co-opt it i i think maybe probably a
[1:38:23.820 --> 1:38:31.660]  little bit of both uh but uh but i'm sure that the american revolution was well planned in europe
[1:38:31.660 --> 1:38:38.620]  for a long time because there were secret societies which were anti against rome and of course rome
[1:38:38.620 --> 1:38:46.460]  for 2300 years has ruled europe and for 2300 years europe has ruled the world and so
[1:38:46.460 --> 1:38:53.660]  well the entire superstructure what we call the old world civilization was europe you up rule the
[1:38:53.660 --> 1:38:59.820]  world and rome you know rule europe and that really is the history you have uh the triple agent
[1:38:59.820 --> 1:39:06.860]  british us and illuminati uh benjamin franklin going over to france getting the support so in a
[1:39:06.860 --> 1:39:13.100]  way we could say that a branch of the illuminati really did uh want liberty or they wanted to
[1:39:13.100 --> 1:39:17.180]  set up their own new tyranny which way well that's right that's right they wanted their own
[1:39:17.180 --> 1:39:22.860]  that will end up consequently they they did set up an order here uh which was the new
[1:39:22.860 --> 1:39:27.580]  atlantis from which uh their writings say that they believe that they were setting up
[1:39:27.580 --> 1:39:34.060]  a new established atlantis on the earth that would become a world dominating power because
[1:39:34.060 --> 1:39:39.500]  it was operating on freedom and liberty and they really and they knew that that was going to happen
[1:39:39.500 --> 1:39:44.220]  they already knew what the end result was going to be what about the goddess columbia
[1:39:44.220 --> 1:39:49.900]  yes that well and i was going to say but at the same time that the that the illuminated
[1:39:49.900 --> 1:39:58.940]  the sonic orders uh that were anti against the rule of europe by rome uh saw america as a
[1:39:58.940 --> 1:40:05.740]  fertile grounds for a new uh revolutionary movement in the world uh at the same time
[1:40:05.740 --> 1:40:11.900]  the vatican and rome realized what was going on so they came around the back door as they
[1:40:11.900 --> 1:40:18.060]  normally do they came in the back door through mexico and began to work on the west coast
[1:40:18.700 --> 1:40:24.300]  with what is called missions they have catholic missions in the vatican missions and of course
[1:40:24.300 --> 1:40:29.100]  out here in california we have nothing but missions everywhere well the word mission
[1:40:29.100 --> 1:40:35.820]  and look it up in old dictionary mission are yet yeah it means it's a it's a military term
[1:40:36.700 --> 1:40:42.460]  it's a military term a mission so when you go to the uh you know to um catholic mission
[1:40:42.460 --> 1:40:50.140]  in california word mission is a military term and this is exactly what's going on right now
[1:40:50.140 --> 1:40:56.620]  with opening the borders to mexico there was a big uh celebration in florida sponsored by
[1:40:56.620 --> 1:41:04.140]  uh the uh roman catholic church sponsored a big uh operation or a big celebration
[1:41:04.700 --> 1:41:11.900]  of which jeb bush attended and it was sponsored by the knights of malta uh celebrating the
[1:41:11.900 --> 1:41:17.900]  opening of the borders for the uh of the mexican borders and they've got pictures they've got
[1:41:17.900 --> 1:41:23.980]  pictures of all the cardinals and priests all dancing around cheering with mexican flags
[1:41:23.980 --> 1:41:30.860]  waving mexican flags uh it's high crimes and treason against the american republic
[1:41:31.420 --> 1:41:38.220]  the the republic is being destroyed by european secret societies operating on the
[1:41:38.220 --> 1:41:42.860]  roam and nobody seems to know anything about it i totally agree with you now since you brought
[1:41:42.860 --> 1:41:46.940]  up rum let's get into tail the jejuice because that because we talk about the founding of this
[1:41:46.940 --> 1:41:52.300]  country to be clear the the roman catholic church at that time was dominated by the same mystery
[1:41:52.300 --> 1:41:58.220]  school so it's two different subcults fighting with each other a kind of spinoff of the main
[1:41:58.220 --> 1:42:03.820]  cult wanting to set up its own new cult but with some different uh rules a would you agree with
[1:42:03.820 --> 1:42:11.500]  that statement and then oh yes yes okay b uh then uh now because yes it's true the catholic church
[1:42:11.500 --> 1:42:16.460]  today is bragging about the laricon quista they're helping push it help teach it in the schools
[1:42:16.460 --> 1:42:20.380]  they want to bring down the united states i'm not bashing catholic people again you're like
[1:42:20.380 --> 1:42:24.780]  i'll just like the protestants are controlled the point is that are you saying they're still a
[1:42:24.780 --> 1:42:31.340]  fisher uh between this group yes i think so because it's always has been even in the mob
[1:42:31.340 --> 1:42:37.820]  even the mob families back east there's always been uh differences of opinion and and uh and
[1:42:37.820 --> 1:42:42.860]  problems with territorial rights and so even in gangs you know the crypts and the bloods
[1:42:42.860 --> 1:42:48.220]  they're always fighting over who's going to eat america up who's going to have us the spoils
[1:42:48.220 --> 1:42:54.940]  yeah as spoils americans you know uh good people never get organized only criminals get organized
[1:42:54.940 --> 1:43:00.700]  criminals are always organized that's why they're always superior because they get organized and
[1:43:00.700 --> 1:43:07.660]  they think and they have intelligent organizations and uh they operate in the dark and they are
[1:43:07.660 --> 1:43:12.860]  they're very very and they're ruthless they're ruthless totally ruthless yeah and then and
[1:43:12.860 --> 1:43:17.020]  and then now they've bred us to be a bunch of mindless saps that can't even read and don't think
[1:43:17.020 --> 1:43:20.860]  that there's evil so we're wide open to it the devil's greatest trick now i want to go back because
[1:43:20.860 --> 1:43:27.980]  i want to stay on uh roam and all these issues yeah uh let's expand on that because i'm glad
[1:43:27.980 --> 1:43:36.540]  you brought that up um go back over the basic cults that took over christianity what they did
[1:43:36.540 --> 1:43:43.900]  when they set it up and then from that point out i want to talk about the different subdivisions
[1:43:43.900 --> 1:43:49.420]  from your deep study of what the new voters divided into up until the european union
[1:43:49.420 --> 1:43:54.060]  with tony blair converting to catholicism because they're saying you've got to be catholic to be
[1:43:54.060 --> 1:43:59.820]  the head of europe preparing him for the europe presidency well that's exactly right look at
[1:43:59.820 --> 1:44:07.180]  logic alone would tell you that what area of the earth has dominated the globe for over two thousand
[1:44:07.180 --> 1:44:14.300]  years if it's not europe europe has dominated the entire world and who has dominated europe it
[1:44:14.300 --> 1:44:20.620]  was that wasn't roam under the ceasars and then during the middle ages and the dark ages and the
[1:44:20.620 --> 1:44:25.740]  medieval time and now they have the swiss as their bank yeah precisely that's what the pope has a
[1:44:25.740 --> 1:44:32.540]  swiss guard they're guarding the bot they're guarding the boss that's why you have a swiss
[1:44:32.540 --> 1:44:40.700]  guards at the Vatican i mean it it's it's it's an incredible array of darkness and conspiratorial
[1:44:41.260 --> 1:44:48.220]  stuff that's been going on and uh... you know as far as i'm concerned it's so overwhelming
[1:44:48.220 --> 1:44:54.780]  in your face when you actually sit in a library and begin to read history and read the the uh
[1:44:54.780 --> 1:45:01.660]  beginnings of the secret societies operating like the knights of malta operating in in with
[1:45:01.660 --> 1:45:08.300]  total uh... impunity they they don't have any problem doing anything in this country now we see
[1:45:08.300 --> 1:45:13.580]  roam going after the Jesuits at one point and the knights of malta from your study can you
[1:45:13.580 --> 1:45:17.340]  can you divide up those groups and is that one unified group or what's happening
[1:45:17.340 --> 1:45:24.620]  as far as i'm concerned it is all one group but as i said in any organized criminal uh enterprise
[1:45:24.620 --> 1:45:30.300]  on a worldwide scale there's going to be in fighting inside i mean there always has been
[1:45:30.300 --> 1:45:36.220]  and even in the old chicago mob there was always killings on the street between the different
[1:45:36.220 --> 1:45:41.260]  fact that the saint valentine's day massacre yeah yeah and uh... but it's it's them them
[1:45:41.260 --> 1:45:46.860]  feeding on themselves now i think that on each other and killed each other then they turn on
[1:45:46.860 --> 1:45:54.780]  the public so it's a it's a mad rush for control and ownership of the human race and that's a
[1:45:54.780 --> 1:46:02.300]  whole story in itself how the human race is lawfully and legally set up to be owned how our
[1:46:02.300 --> 1:46:08.540]  bodies are actually owned on the spot market and how well they call it human human resources
[1:46:08.540 --> 1:46:14.060]  that's exactly right if you you don't go to employment office you go to a human resource
[1:46:14.620 --> 1:46:21.340]  just like ten and iron and rubber and oil it's a resource it seems it seems they have a rule though
[1:46:21.340 --> 1:46:24.700]  to always tell you what they're doing and give you a chance to fight back against
[1:46:24.700 --> 1:46:30.940]  them uh... how does that feed into their their their esoteric rules well that's true there is
[1:46:30.940 --> 1:46:35.420]  there is a lot of there that's all you need to do is just go to a library and read it
[1:46:35.420 --> 1:46:41.820]  it's all right there you can go on the web and go to uh... just just type in go to google and
[1:46:41.820 --> 1:46:49.900]  just type in uh... commerce game annual and there's a lot of material on how commerce
[1:46:49.900 --> 1:46:56.380]  actually in fact works and it doesn't work nothing works the way you think it does banks
[1:46:56.940 --> 1:47:05.260]  by law are not allowed to loan money ever that there is a absolute law banks can not ever
[1:47:05.260 --> 1:47:11.180]  loan money because think about it if you go and put ten thousand dollars into a bank
[1:47:11.180 --> 1:47:15.740]  and then twenty minutes later i walk in and borrow twenty dollar twenty thousand dollars
[1:47:15.740 --> 1:47:22.220]  to buy a new car i just took your money to buy my new car suppose i don't pay it back
[1:47:22.220 --> 1:47:28.140]  now you are out twenty thousand dollars because i spent it on my car that i'm not going to pay for
[1:47:28.140 --> 1:47:34.860]  so banks cannot loan money they have never loan money they loan letters of credit
[1:47:34.860 --> 1:47:41.820]  all well that's different and what is the credit based on it is based on you the slaves
[1:47:41.820 --> 1:47:46.780]  and uh... it's it's basically an imperial mark saying you've got this credit that's right
[1:47:46.780 --> 1:47:53.100]  exactly so they're not giving you anything and uh... and they want you understand the way a bank
[1:47:53.100 --> 1:48:00.620]  works then you can say all i see how this stuff works now i see you know but most people have no
[1:48:00.620 --> 1:48:06.140]  idea in the world why they go to court you only play basketball tennis on a court yeah let's get
[1:48:06.140 --> 1:48:11.100]  into the court because i talked to lawyers and they admit all this they pray to the judge it's
[1:48:11.100 --> 1:48:17.820]  all a uh... Saturn ritual and the judges even know this this is a temple that's why the courthouse
[1:48:17.820 --> 1:48:24.380]  in the supreme court is a temple uh... tell me right but it is i mean they say it is i mean
[1:48:24.380 --> 1:48:30.940]  even in their record they they talk about it you know they're uh... again i don't even know
[1:48:30.940 --> 1:48:34.460]  where to start because i've been looking at this for forty eight years i don't even know where
[1:48:34.460 --> 1:48:40.620]  to start because there's so much to be said about how people are being manipulated and
[1:48:40.620 --> 1:48:47.420]  exploited in their ignorance and have no idea in the world what's going on for instance there's
[1:48:47.420 --> 1:48:54.300]  two of everything in our country there are there's not fifty states there's one hundred states in
[1:48:54.300 --> 1:49:01.340]  america not fifty and people talk about the united states is one nation indivisible the united
[1:49:01.340 --> 1:49:09.820]  states of america is not one nation and it is not indivisible because america is not one nation
[1:49:09.820 --> 1:49:17.500]  it is fifty different nations each state is a sovereign entity of its own and consequently
[1:49:17.500 --> 1:49:23.820]  you can do things in one state that you can't do in another so we're not one nation indivisible
[1:49:23.820 --> 1:49:29.820]  no not at all there are fifty different nations and each one has their own government and then
[1:49:29.820 --> 1:49:34.540]  we have the founders are doing that saying that would keep tyranny from overrunning it
[1:49:34.540 --> 1:49:37.660]  and now who we are two hundred and thirty something years later finally the feds are
[1:49:37.660 --> 1:49:43.100]  federalizing everything everything feds have come in now look at the federal government is like
[1:49:44.140 --> 1:49:51.020]  if you buy a condo and a building you own your own apartment or condo in the building but there
[1:49:51.020 --> 1:49:56.860]  are other people who own their condos in the building so you have to live with other people
[1:49:56.860 --> 1:50:02.780]  so therefore you you get together and you decide who's going to be in charge of taking the trash
[1:50:02.780 --> 1:50:07.980]  out for everyone who's going to be in charge of cleaning the pool for everyone so everybody
[1:50:07.980 --> 1:50:12.780]  chips in a few dollars at each month uh... yeah the federal government is the home owning
[1:50:12.780 --> 1:50:19.420]  association yes that's exactly right and therefore but now they the people who have been appointed

[1:55:14.220 --> 1:55:18.460]  jordan maxwell one of the foremost experts on the subject word maxwell dot com is our guest
[1:55:18.460 --> 1:55:26.140]  into the next hour great to have him on with us i'm on his site i'm in a section on religion
[1:55:27.020 --> 1:55:31.340]  hidden roots of religion then we're going to get into words to search but i'm looking at the iron
[1:55:31.340 --> 1:55:39.740]  cross the night's tumblr i'm looking at these symbols also being used in the united states
[1:55:39.740 --> 1:55:46.380]  as well what does that symbol mean when we see the iron cross well that's interesting you know it
[1:55:46.380 --> 1:55:53.900]  is used everywhere and most people don't you know do not realize what the iron cross meant
[1:55:53.900 --> 1:56:00.380]  where it comes from it's associated with very powerful dark secret societies in europe
[1:56:00.380 --> 1:56:07.740]  especially in germany and how the vatican bestows when the vatican bestows uh some uh
[1:56:08.620 --> 1:56:15.900]  you know some kind of a uh... what am i trying to say some kind of an award on politicians
[1:56:15.900 --> 1:56:23.260]  is always the iron cross the iron cross was used by not the germany at off hitler it's used by the
[1:56:23.260 --> 1:56:31.260]  knights of malta a secret society operating within the vatican which also gave us the knights of
[1:56:31.260 --> 1:56:38.220]  malta are responsible for giving to america the cia a cia is a knight's of malta operation so the
[1:56:38.220 --> 1:56:42.700]  knights of malta the knights of malta you think are more powerful than jesuit so the same oh i
[1:56:42.700 --> 1:56:48.460]  think that they are working kind of with uh... the the jesuit maybe even the jesuit are the
[1:56:48.460 --> 1:56:54.780]  brains behind the malta it's very difficult to know even when you're in those secret societies
[1:56:54.780 --> 1:56:59.580]  it's hard to tell you know who the bosses are that's another problem is that i've always talked
[1:56:59.580 --> 1:57:03.900]  about this and always had guests on about it and then you've got other nuts out there who just make
[1:57:03.900 --> 1:57:09.020]  up wild claims crazy things and then you know and then when somebody calls you a jesuit or
[1:57:09.020 --> 1:57:14.140]  someone i'm not even catholic and uh... then it's kind of hard to cover their their research when
[1:57:14.140 --> 1:57:19.260]  they believe in flying saucers and and and that the earth is a center of the universe i mean
[1:57:19.260 --> 1:57:23.020]  then here i've got you and countless others on they'll still say i never talked about it never
[1:57:23.020 --> 1:57:27.580]  discussed it no matter how many guests a week i have on on the subject will never end because
[1:57:27.580 --> 1:57:32.060]  but but but you're a credible researcher because we're covering now now now uh... the uh...
[1:57:32.860 --> 1:57:37.500]  the the iron crosses associated with bachas is it not that's the roman devil
[1:57:37.500 --> 1:57:43.340]  well and it's also associated with the old somerian uh... the ancient somerians used the same

[2:01:39.740 --> 2:01:44.700]  works on that subject you can do research on it yourself well here's an example they love i mean
[2:01:44.700 --> 2:01:49.020]  the nazis didn't invent wearing the skull and crossbones they've done that in the teutonic
[2:01:49.020 --> 2:01:53.260]  nights for that's right close to a thousand years why do they worship the symbol of the
[2:01:53.260 --> 2:01:59.420]  skull and crossbones normally missing the bottom mandible well you know there's all kinds of reasons
[2:01:59.420 --> 2:02:05.500]  that have been given uh skull and crossbones like you said it was used by the knights of the
[2:02:05.500 --> 2:02:11.660]  caribbean of the uh the knights of malta and some of the masonic orders that were the european
[2:02:11.660 --> 2:02:16.700]  roman masonic orders that we call pirates of the caribbean that's why the pirates always had the
[2:02:16.700 --> 2:02:23.340]  the what is called the jolly roger of the black flag you know the black was always the saturnian
[2:02:23.340 --> 2:02:29.500]  color it represented death and so the black flag with the skull and crossbones was the symbol
[2:02:29.500 --> 2:02:34.780]  for what uh what we call the uh pirates of the caribbean well the pirates of the caribbean
[2:02:34.780 --> 2:02:41.340]  were the old knights Templars who uh not only did business all over the world on the oceans but
[2:02:41.340 --> 2:02:48.620]  they even stole from the governments and private investors and you know different ships uh on the
[2:02:48.620 --> 2:02:55.260]  high seas they would they would raid these ships and uh that makes their their carcass even bigger
[2:02:55.260 --> 2:02:59.020]  you know they're making a lot of money they're doing it with business or they'll just rob you
[2:02:59.020 --> 2:03:03.740]  one of the two and they're still doing that all over the world the bankers are still robbing
[2:03:03.740 --> 2:03:08.620]  the people ripping them off putting it in the banks and using the same symbols that they've
[2:03:08.620 --> 2:03:16.620]  always used the way they've always done it so uh you know it's it's the the more we change the more
[2:03:16.620 --> 2:03:21.660]  we stay the same the the same stuff that was been going on for a thousand years still going on the
[2:03:21.660 --> 2:03:28.460]  day and uh but now they've they've made it into a real business now a lot of the things I talk
[2:03:28.460 --> 2:03:33.740]  about especially when in relation to what we're talking about now the occult societies there's
[2:03:33.740 --> 2:03:41.260]  an excellent book which you cannot find anywhere since it's no longer printed uh it's no longer

[2:08:07.740 --> 2:08:12.780]  pull out of the union and the new world continues to expand that is coming up in about an hour
[2:08:13.660 --> 2:08:21.420]  man things time has really flown by with jordan maxwell um jordan again is a permanent researcher
[2:08:21.420 --> 2:08:28.620]  into the core documents of the elite and what makes them tick jordan give us a tour of the basic
[2:08:28.620 --> 2:08:34.380]  history of of of where all this really starts as best you can tell have they been passing on
[2:08:34.380 --> 2:08:40.860]  knowledge do they claim they have the secrets of the pyramids and atlantis and all this uh or is
[2:08:40.860 --> 2:08:47.740]  that uh fable uh how much power do they really have uh you know you talk about how they their
[2:08:47.740 --> 2:08:53.500]  main goal and now they admit this is to create two species of humanoid dumb us down exterminate
[2:08:53.500 --> 2:08:58.940]  most of us i mean i'm just throwing out you know the basics here because broad strokes here in the
[2:08:58.940 --> 2:09:03.420]  time we have and then for the behind the scenes viewers at prism planet dot tv i want to continue
[2:09:03.420 --> 2:09:08.220]  that discussion afterwards uh after you finish that with you believe the roman catholic church
[2:09:08.220 --> 2:09:12.220]  is at the very top it didn't mean the roman catholic adherence of the people but you know
[2:09:12.220 --> 2:09:17.900]  that system dominating europe and that it's at war with the knights Templars who went to
[2:09:17.900 --> 2:09:24.540]  to germany who went uh to uh from there uh into scotland and then into the united states
[2:09:25.100 --> 2:09:29.420]  are those two you know the anglo-american establishment really waging war with europe
[2:09:29.420 --> 2:09:35.020]  or why on the surface does it look like they're all working together uh or uh is that what the
[2:09:35.020 --> 2:09:39.420]  new world order is was was the knights Templars claiming they were going to build a new order
[2:09:39.420 --> 2:09:45.020]  but now it's really just a new order uh that's run by the vatican uh again this is where all
[2:09:45.020 --> 2:09:50.300]  the evidence points that's why we're here discussing it uh it doesn't matter if it's tbn with all
[2:09:50.300 --> 2:09:55.340]  their weird statues or protestants catholics it's all run by the new old order but but jordan was
[2:09:55.340 --> 2:09:59.340]  saying there could be some splits there so i want to walk through that was expertise but jordan
[2:09:59.340 --> 2:10:04.860]  that's a long-winded question there try to try to tackle that you know scanning the pyramid i mean
[2:10:04.860 --> 2:10:09.500]  let's say if you had 10 minutes to talk to the world about the structure of it who they are
[2:10:09.500 --> 2:10:17.740]  why it's important to know uh tell us well i think that it's all one ball of wax it's all
[2:10:17.740 --> 2:10:25.020]  one operation that goes back thousands of years into the ancient past a religious political
[2:10:25.020 --> 2:10:33.260]  establishment on the earth uh and the ancient prehistoric world the the kings uh will always
[2:10:33.260 --> 2:10:38.460]  not only had a government and law but they also represented the connection between
[2:10:38.460 --> 2:10:46.620]  mankind their followers and god so consequently they they they held absolute sovereign power
[2:10:47.340 --> 2:10:54.140]  and i have always understood that kingships and princes is nothing more than the crypts
[2:10:54.140 --> 2:11:02.380]  and the bloods people who have taken for themselves uh uh the the idea that they are royalty
[2:11:02.380 --> 2:11:10.300]  you've got to be out of your mind not to question who said that you are royal i mean in america
[2:11:10.300 --> 2:11:17.420]  nobody likes to be around somebody who is pompous and arrogant and better than anybody else nobody
[2:11:17.420 --> 2:11:23.500]  likes to be around those people because everybody realizes those people live in a dream world who
[2:11:23.500 --> 2:11:31.020]  treat you and miss mistreat you and look down on you and snob you out of people know that that's
[2:11:31.020 --> 2:11:38.540]  just uh a fake and and that they're no better than anybody else so we naturally feel that about
[2:11:38.540 --> 2:11:45.260]  people who are snobs however if it's the holy father or the queen mom now that's different
[2:11:45.260 --> 2:11:52.620]  we will get on our knees and shake and slobber on ourselves because we are our be able to see
[2:11:52.620 --> 2:11:59.500]  the holy father or we'll be able to see queen mom or prince charles will struggle and pay
[2:11:59.500 --> 2:12:06.220]  whatever we have to to get in line to see prince charles drive by when in point of fact the
[2:12:06.220 --> 2:12:13.020]  british royalty vatican royalty royalty all over europe is nothing but the crypts and the
[2:12:13.020 --> 2:12:20.060]  bloods gangs gangs who have murdered and killed and and destroyed the freedom of peoples and
[2:12:20.060 --> 2:12:27.260]  all over the earth and today they are in power they're ruthless they're murderous they are
[2:12:27.260 --> 2:12:33.660]  they are nothing more than gang wars secret societies criminal cults criminal operations
[2:12:33.660 --> 2:12:38.460]  wow you just made a point whenever i see the low-level crypts and bloods and the vatoes
[2:12:38.460 --> 2:12:43.260]  they're all calling themselves latin kings their symbols are little crowns they have
[2:12:43.260 --> 2:12:48.540]  secret handshakes and signs and that really is just it that's it that's the name of the
[2:12:48.540 --> 2:12:55.260]  tune royalty and holy people at the top the priest and the holy ones of and all the different
[2:12:55.260 --> 2:13:01.260]  religions from the billy grams to the papacy to all the silly nonsense is on christian
[2:13:01.260 --> 2:13:07.260]  television with all the preachers who are making ten fifteen million dollars with their huge
[2:13:07.260 --> 2:13:17.260]  enormous churches it's nothing more than a con job it's a con job and people are extraordinarily
[2:13:17.260 --> 2:13:23.260]  interested in being lied to deceived you know even in the bible there's a story about
[2:13:23.260 --> 2:13:29.260]  pontius pilot bringing jesus to the crowd with the rabbi's and on the one hand he's
[2:13:29.260 --> 2:13:35.260]  got the rabbi's which everybody knows of the con artist in a murder and a thief and then
[2:13:35.260 --> 2:13:41.260]  on the other side is jesus who represents the truth and the light and it's a metaphoric story
[2:13:41.260 --> 2:13:47.260]  of where where government says to the people the pontius pilot head of government says to
[2:13:47.260 --> 2:13:55.260]  the people here is Pontius by here is a rabbi's a murdering thieving scumbag and here is jesus
[2:13:55.260 --> 2:14:01.260]  representing the truth and the light and the scripture says with one voice the people cried
[2:14:01.260 --> 2:14:07.260]  out give us the rabbi's which is translated symbolically to mean when the people of this
[2:14:07.260 --> 2:14:13.260]  world are given an opportunity to know the truth or to crawl in their knees before their
[2:14:13.260 --> 2:14:21.260]  masters who are nothing more than liars murderers bloodshedding thieves people will always support
[2:14:21.260 --> 2:14:27.260]  the masters they don't want the truth that's what i was going to ask is this morning it's almost like a spirit
[2:14:27.260 --> 2:14:33.260]  i got criticized yesterday somebody sent me a youtube young guy saying alex used to say there was
[2:14:33.260 --> 2:14:39.260]  a new world order i choose not to believe it i don't want to believe it it doesn't exist i choose i heard all these
[2:14:39.260 --> 2:14:44.260]  radio shows with callers i flip channels and i'd come into work and it was other shows saying i don't
[2:14:44.260 --> 2:14:50.260]  want to hear bad news anymore then understand if you face the bad news and deal with it then you can have a good
[2:14:50.260 --> 2:14:56.260]  place to live in and have more liberty but when you just deny and want to live in denial and want to lie to
[2:14:56.260 --> 2:15:02.260]  yourself you have a horrible world and it's true a lot of people they want to be lied to they want to be
[2:15:02.260 --> 2:15:09.260]  conned and it's cute and funny and i understand it well i mean you know i mean in a country that is
[2:15:09.260 --> 2:15:17.260]  staggering in their economic woes and economic disabilities in this country people are crawling
[2:15:17.260 --> 2:15:25.260]  on the knees sleeping in their cars and yet the alcohol industry smoking industry television
[2:15:25.260 --> 2:15:34.260]  entertainment movies are making a bumper crop they're making billions why because the people have lost
[2:15:34.260 --> 2:15:41.260]  their souls they have nothing to live for they have no design that was a seduction because it's almost
[2:15:41.260 --> 2:15:46.260]  like a joke now i talked about the street and it's like they're getting more retarded by the by the week
[2:15:46.260 --> 2:15:52.260]  without a doubt absolutely what is going on it's like a mass mutation is taking place before my eyes
[2:15:52.260 --> 2:15:58.260]  absolutely i'm telling you and it's it's frightening because i know what the future is going to be
[2:15:58.260 --> 2:16:05.260]  i already know what's coming there's going to be a time very soon when americans generally speaking
[2:16:05.260 --> 2:16:11.260]  and the one the worst part about it is that the masses will never wake up they will just become
[2:16:11.260 --> 2:16:17.260]  acclimated to the system well i don't know the documents i mean the new thing said you'll be arrested
[2:16:17.260 --> 2:16:22.260]  if you're seen hugging your child or kissing them i mean so and the government says will be in gray
[2:16:22.260 --> 2:16:28.260]  uniforms with shaved heads basically lobotomized and that's who's even allowed to live and i see
[2:16:28.260 --> 2:16:34.260]  them facing that in rather quickly the way it's going that's exactly what i'm saying and so i'm
[2:16:34.260 --> 2:16:40.260]  frightened because i know what is coming on the earth i know the kind of world which is coming
[2:16:40.260 --> 2:16:46.260]  and the people have no idea generally speaking the public doesn't know they don't care because
[2:16:46.260 --> 2:16:52.260]  they've been acclimated to it they have already learned how to crawl on their knees when they see
[2:16:52.260 --> 2:17:00.260]  some holy some holy man with a with a robe if it's a black robe they shake in fear if it's a black
[2:17:00.260 --> 2:17:07.260]  robe for the priest they shake in fear so they've been acclimated and taught to be impressed with
[2:17:07.260 --> 2:17:14.260]  movie stars and wealthy people with big money you know but it seems that the elite themselves have
[2:17:14.260 --> 2:17:20.260]  gotten more reckless and wild of course and the reason why is because they realize the entire
[2:17:20.260 --> 2:17:27.260]  human race is worthless that the entire human race is going to buy anything you put out there
[2:17:27.260 --> 2:17:33.260]  and now it's like the criminal element doesn't even know what to do with itself anymore it's so easy
[2:17:33.260 --> 2:17:40.260]  it's so easy to just fool the people because they love it well that's i mean i mean exactly that's
[2:17:40.260 --> 2:17:46.260]  like the white house publicly says they're running al-qaeda and has them attacking iran and the media
[2:17:46.260 --> 2:17:53.260]  says iran is al-qaeda when they're shia it's the opposite group and then it's it's just all over the
[2:17:53.260 --> 2:18:00.260]  news republicans saying we love we love a terror attacks they sure help us and and i mean how much
[2:18:00.260 --> 2:18:05.260]  more obvious and then and then gary heart writes a letter has it published in the newspaper saying
[2:18:05.260 --> 2:18:10.260]  our government stages attacks iran better do what they're told i mean that they're basically they may
[2:18:10.260 --> 2:18:17.260]  come out and say they did it so well i'd but you know what nobody's going to care couldn't care less
[2:18:17.260 --> 2:18:23.260]  because it doesn't mean much to put to anybody anyway so as just that you know and even on the
[2:18:23.260 --> 2:18:29.260]  tonight show with jay Leno when he does the jay walked with my god street and talks to people
[2:18:29.260 --> 2:18:34.260]  ask the average american you know who won the second world war they don't even know what you're
[2:18:34.260 --> 2:18:40.260]  talking about they didn't know there was a second world war and you know and of course that that
[2:18:40.260 --> 2:18:47.260]  thing we talked about before about that young lady miss teen america that was so appalling to be
[2:18:47.260 --> 2:18:54.260]  i still wake up with a sweaty but that's how listen that's how people are if you know any history
[2:18:54.260 --> 2:18:59.260]  they look at you like you're weird and people kind of sit back in their chairs and act scared
[2:18:59.260 --> 2:19:06.260]  friends my personal friends many years ago uh... that's what they used to say about me that you
[2:19:06.260 --> 2:19:11.260]  you're weird you study and one one guy told me is that you're the only person i know
[2:19:11.260 --> 2:19:17.260]  uh... in our circle of friends that you don't fit i mean something about you that's just not right
[2:19:17.260 --> 2:19:22.260]  and i said in what way and why don't you read all those all that crazy stuff and it's like what
[2:19:22.260 --> 2:19:29.260]  for instance all those law books and all that stuff about religion and all that and uh... you know
[2:19:29.260 --> 2:19:36.260]  the bottom line is that he is so far removed from reality that anybody has a half a brain
[2:19:36.260 --> 2:19:42.260]  looks like a freak to him so i know what it is if you are smart intelligent and inquisitive
[2:19:42.260 --> 2:19:48.260]  you're not going to fit in this world stay there stay there jordan max we're going to keep talking
[2:19:48.260 --> 2:19:53.260]  when i learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints
[2:19:53.260 --> 2:19:58.260]  lack of energy and weight gain i knew i would have to change to a more alkaline diet but it just seems
[2:19:58.260 --> 2:20:04.260]  so difficult then a friend suggested i try a jupiter water ionizer from Snyder health dot com

[2:23:57.260 --> 2:24:03.260]  your neck at body I told you that six years ago now it's mainstream news and they tell you now they
[2:24:03.260 --> 2:24:09.260]  take blood without warrants at checkpoints and Jordan was during the behind the scenes prison
[2:24:09.260 --> 2:24:15.260]  planet on TV discussion he was bringing up the airports this is our slave training isn't it Jordan
[2:24:15.260 --> 2:24:20.260]  no no no doubt about it I mean anybody's got more than 500 brain cells going on the same direction
[2:24:20.260 --> 2:24:27.260]  knows that it's just a it's outrageous but I was just saying that I would I went to Disney
[2:24:27.260 --> 2:24:33.260]  studios yesterday and because I got a letter from Disney saying that there was a piece of work that
[2:24:33.260 --> 2:24:39.260]  I'm doing with Disney and they needed a contract signed and so they said get this back to us
[2:24:39.260 --> 2:24:45.260]  immediately because you only have a couple of days to get this contract in so get it immediately
[2:24:45.260 --> 2:24:51.260]  or bring it over so I took the contract over in the envelope sealed it up and drove over there and
[2:24:51.260 --> 2:24:55.260]  all the security guard had to do was throw it in the mailbox just wrote the mailbox and drop it in
[2:24:55.260 --> 2:25:00.260]  the mail so I said this is just a piece of mail but I wanted to drop it in instead of mailing it
[2:25:00.260 --> 2:25:06.260]  because it's it's time sensitive and he said oh no no we can't do that so we have to open it we
[2:25:06.260 --> 2:25:11.260]  have to open it up and I have to read it to see what's in it first before I can deliver the mail
[2:25:11.260 --> 2:25:17.260]  I have to at Disney I have to open the mail and I have to read the contract and I've got to see
[2:25:17.260 --> 2:25:22.260]  exactly who wrote this contract and who signed it and what is all about first.
[2:25:22.260 --> 2:25:27.260]  See just no privacy no nothing no just just total control.
[2:25:27.260 --> 2:25:33.260]  Total and I said why don't you just drop it in the mail because if there's anything wrong the people
[2:25:33.260 --> 2:25:38.260]  who it's going to will tell me that's not your business to know you're just a security guard
[2:25:38.260 --> 2:25:44.260]  security no no I've got the badge I'm in charge it's my I'm the boss because I have the badge
[2:25:44.260 --> 2:25:50.260]  so I have to open the mail and I have to sit down and take a few minutes and read this contract
[2:25:50.260 --> 2:25:56.260]  and see who it's going to and who signed it and before I can drop it in the and I said why don't
[2:25:56.260 --> 2:26:02.260]  you just drop it in the mail no no I have the badge it's my job and I'm in charge
[2:26:02.260 --> 2:26:08.260]  well it's the same kind of thing at the airport that's why I don't fly anymore
[2:26:08.260 --> 2:26:13.260]  that's why I do not fly anymore because I don't have to take my pants off my shoes off
[2:26:13.260 --> 2:26:19.260]  and have everything as I why bother I just don't even know but now it's going to be on the buses trains
[2:26:19.260 --> 2:26:24.260]  and the sides of the street and they know they know it's dog training training is how to be slaves
[2:26:24.260 --> 2:26:29.260]  well that's it I don't know what else to say it's all right there in your face
[2:26:29.260 --> 2:26:34.260]  but well I mean here's the deal if the United States is run by the Knights Templars or I guess you said
[2:26:34.260 --> 2:26:38.260]  it's inseparable and then we end in the Vatican wants to get rid of the borders
[2:26:38.260 --> 2:26:43.260]  why does every city and I have articles that came out in the news today and yesterday mainline news
[2:26:43.260 --> 2:26:47.260]  the police do not arrest illegals for drinking and driving they don't arrest them for anything
[2:26:47.260 --> 2:26:54.260]  but felonies and they are also hiring aggravated felons that are mainly foreigners
[2:26:54.260 --> 2:27:00.260]  military and and and the illegals are literally above the law and then even when the police say
[2:27:00.260 --> 2:27:05.260]  Mexican troops are kidnapping and killing Americans the news it tells them that can't be true
[2:27:05.260 --> 2:27:08.260]  I mean why is Mexico so precious?
[2:27:08.260 --> 2:27:18.260]  Well because it's a base first of all it's a very important base for for revolution in the North America
[2:27:18.260 --> 2:27:25.260]  it's a very important operating base like the Contras have bases in Central America like the
[2:27:25.260 --> 2:27:31.260]  Medellin cartel have their protected bases of operation for drug trafficking
[2:27:31.260 --> 2:27:38.260]  well for tyranny and drug trafficking underworld activities Mexico is a hotbed
[2:27:38.260 --> 2:27:43.260]  my god anybody who's more than 10 years old has been to Mexico knows that
[2:27:43.260 --> 2:27:51.260]  Mexico is a hotbed for secret societies crime criminal syndicates drug trafficking
[2:27:51.260 --> 2:27:55.260]  so you want to make sure that the that the borders are left open
[2:27:55.260 --> 2:28:01.260]  because the bottom line is that Europe has had enough of America freedom
[2:28:01.260 --> 2:28:07.260]  I mean when that's so obvious to me because I've been looking at it for so many years
[2:28:07.260 --> 2:28:13.260]  it is obviously and we're gonna be destroyed by hooker by crook
[2:28:13.260 --> 2:28:19.260]  absolutely because they you know that's the only thing Bush ever said that is 100% correct
[2:28:19.260 --> 2:28:25.260]  he said that that our enemies hate us because of our freedom
[2:28:25.260 --> 2:28:31.260]  the terrorist attack us because they hate our freedom and you find out the terrorist is the black ops
[2:28:31.260 --> 2:28:35.260]  and they did it to get our freedom and the government's taking all our freedom
[2:28:35.260 --> 2:28:39.260]  well but but our enemies the amen enemy of the American people
[2:28:39.260 --> 2:28:44.260]  hate us because of our freedom and I'm going to tell you something that is the bottom line
[2:28:44.260 --> 2:28:51.260]  at the end of the day that is the only truth there is is that are the enemies of this great republic
[2:28:51.260 --> 2:28:58.260]  hate this republic because they cannot have a new world order in which the entire human race
[2:28:58.260 --> 2:29:05.260]  crawls on its knees like animals to their masters of superior masters with a country that talks
[2:29:05.260 --> 2:29:12.260]  about individual freedom, liberty and justice for all you've got to destroy this nation
[2:29:12.260 --> 2:29:16.260]  and the only people and and who is it that who are the enemies
[2:29:16.260 --> 2:29:23.260]  it's the Roman system of Europe that has been dominating the earth for 2300 years
[2:29:23.260 --> 2:29:30.260]  of which America rose up against Jordan say there gotta gotta go to break we're gonna talk behind scenes too
[2:29:30.260 --> 2:29:34.260]  but very very interesting ladies and gentlemen we'll be right back
[2:29:38.260 --> 2:29:45.260]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[2:29:45.260 --> 2:29:52.260]  our beloved republic is on her knees the forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty

[2:33:09.260 --> 2:33:16.260]  came into Phoenix and killed people I'm in the mouths of the border is that and LAPD won't
[2:33:16.260 --> 2:33:21.260]  ask about immigrant status associated press I was mentioning that I've got several articles
[2:33:21.260 --> 2:33:29.260]  like this in front of me today that's out of the associated press and my whole point is
[2:33:29.260 --> 2:33:34.260]  is that the Spanish stations are all got names like the rebel the race it's all we're going
[2:33:34.260 --> 2:33:38.260]  to take over we're going to get you we're going to overthrow the US and the government
[2:33:38.260 --> 2:33:42.260]  saying oh my gosh give all your rights up there's al-qaeda everywhere and there's no real al-qaeda
[2:33:42.260 --> 2:33:49.260]  it's al-siaida but meanwhile there is a real group with with TV companies buying 700 billboards
[2:33:49.260 --> 2:33:57.260]  saying LA belongs to Mexico you've got people that are tourist to Mexico get shut down and
[2:33:57.260 --> 2:34:02.260]  robbed the media covers that up you've got the illegal aliens and I've been told this cops
[2:34:02.260 --> 2:34:06.260]  called in yesterday and agreed but I've had it happen right here in Austin you can drunk drive
[2:34:06.260 --> 2:34:11.260]  no insurance no license by the law citizens the books are thrown at and the police are told
[2:34:11.260 --> 2:34:16.260]  do not arrest illegals and it says right here they can be under felony charges and they do
[2:34:16.260 --> 2:34:21.260]  bring up if they're illegal or legal or not that is not an issue so so so for all intents
[2:34:21.260 --> 2:34:25.260]  and purposes the borders are wide open that fence they're putting up is to keep Americans
[2:34:25.260 --> 2:34:33.260]  in and you know my whole point is you during the break you were talking about Henry Kissinger's
[2:34:33.260 --> 2:34:37.260]  own book that you know kiss the boys goodbye and it's a quote he admits where he said the
[2:34:37.260 --> 2:34:42.260]  military are dumb animals to be used by us the police are hated by the new world order
[2:34:42.260 --> 2:34:47.260]  and use the military are hated and use they call them dumb animals our futures being destroyed
[2:34:47.260 --> 2:34:54.260]  and I guess Jordan Maxwell we the people in the establishment the minions I guess we're
[2:34:54.260 --> 2:35:00.260]  just going to assist in our own destruction Jordan I guess so I guess it's just as part
[2:35:00.260 --> 2:35:07.260]  of who we are as a people we have lost our souls we have lost our minds and we've lost
[2:35:07.260 --> 2:35:13.260]  our republic and now we're just going to lose period and reason why is because most people
[2:35:13.260 --> 2:35:20.260]  I understand it bothers me but I understand why most people do not relate to the stuff
[2:35:20.260 --> 2:35:26.260]  that I've been talking about for 45 years and I understand why because most of what I talk
[2:35:26.260 --> 2:35:33.260]  about has nothing to do with football sports basketball none of that and it has to do with
[2:35:33.260 --> 2:35:39.260]  researching and studying the movements of the bankers the history of the world ancient history
[2:35:39.260 --> 2:35:44.260]  and how it impacted people not want to know how the world really works this is all they
[2:35:44.260 --> 2:35:50.260]  don't know but it doesn't have anything to do with basketball so what is the importance
[2:35:50.260 --> 2:35:55.260]  of it all I mean we don't have anything to do with Hooters or football it might be of
[2:35:55.260 --> 2:36:01.260]  importance so most people don't give a damn about America they don't care about freedom
[2:36:01.260 --> 2:36:05.260]  they don't care that their children are being implanted with cancer well I know but look
[2:36:05.260 --> 2:36:10.260]  at it look at it like the Bible Jesus saying look by their fruits you shall know them we're
[2:36:10.260 --> 2:36:16.260]  supposedly a very Christian nation we're very holy and righteous nation by their fruits
[2:36:16.260 --> 2:36:21.260]  you shall know that what is the footage of the American civilization today 50 million
[2:36:21.260 --> 2:36:27.260]  abortions huge buckets of pus just a mental illness totally degeneracy that's it throw
[2:36:27.260 --> 2:36:35.260]  in throw in drive-by shootings crimes gang members rapes incredible and law there is
[2:36:35.260 --> 2:36:42.260]  no law law is a mockery that's by their fruits you shall know them I'm telling you it's just
[2:36:42.260 --> 2:36:49.260]  an incredible story and then here's a here's a great quote by George Bush's mother the
[2:36:49.260 --> 2:36:55.260]  president's mother her beautiful mom Barbara yeah Barbara Bush said when she was asked about
[2:36:55.260 --> 2:37:00.260]  all the coffins coming back from the Middle East all the young men who are dying that
[2:37:00.260 --> 2:37:06.260]  was Larry King live young Larry King live she says quote this is Barbara Bush saying
[2:37:06.260 --> 2:37:13.260]  it about American troops she said why should we hear about body bags and death it's not
[2:37:13.260 --> 2:37:20.260]  relevant so why should I waste my beautiful mind or something like that I was just amazed
[2:37:20.260 --> 2:37:25.260]  that the president's mother would say who do I help cares about these chumps and in
[2:37:25.260 --> 2:37:29.260]  that said I don't know exactly in that same newscast she was kind of in a meltdown she

[2:38:11.260 --> 2:38:17.260]  he says in his own book military men are just dumb stupid animals to be used as pawns and
[2:38:17.260 --> 2:38:23.260]  foreign policy period they're just animals so who they help cares if they get killed

[2:41:00.260 --> 2:41:06.260]  you that's tell folks what the dog tags mean yeah the dog tag is that's what military
[2:41:06.260 --> 2:41:12.260]  people and people in law enforcement have an identification playing on a chain around
[2:41:12.260 --> 2:41:17.260]  the neck and it's called a dog tag and the reason why is because that's exactly what
[2:41:17.260 --> 2:41:25.260]  the military is conceived to be a bunch of dogs I mean that's what Henry Kissinger said
[2:41:25.260 --> 2:41:29.260]  I don't know it's just a outright just to me I mean all you got to do is just read a book
[2:41:29.260 --> 2:41:34.260]  you know just go to the library and get a book on any of these subjects and like I said
[2:41:34.260 --> 2:41:38.260]  just go on my website I've already done all the research for you just go on my website
[2:41:38.260 --> 2:41:45.260]  and go to research boxes and there's all kinds of boxes there on all kinds of subjects and
[2:41:45.260 --> 2:41:51.260]  go through my website because there's a lot of material on the links and and I and you
[2:41:51.260 --> 2:41:56.260]  know I don't even there's just so much on my website it's very well let's go through
[2:41:56.260 --> 2:42:01.260]  words this research and you spend a minute or so on each one the black hand tell folks
[2:42:01.260 --> 2:42:07.260]  about the black hand well that was a precursor to what we today call mafia uh look who's an
[2:42:07.260 --> 2:42:13.260]  austra but a long time ago in the middle ages what we call today mafia look who's an austra
[2:42:13.260 --> 2:42:20.260]  was called black hand black of course being the planet the saffron so it was a saturnian
[2:42:20.260 --> 2:42:26.260]  secret society the black hand later become known as a cousin austra uh it was uh connected
[2:42:26.260 --> 2:42:32.260]  to uh the masonic orders the and of course who said it didn't exist kind of like the
[2:42:32.260 --> 2:42:38.260]  north american union doesn't exist i mean this incredible denial how do you deal with
[2:42:38.260 --> 2:42:42.260]  the denial i know when when when when all of this is going on around people and they
[2:42:42.260 --> 2:42:47.260]  just say it doesn't exist i know and so what can you do i mean what can you say i i know
[2:42:47.260 --> 2:42:52.260]  all i know is i just put it out there and people like i said ask me questions that are
[2:42:52.260 --> 2:42:56.260]  right here on my website no i know but we're doing this live on the radio uh british east
[2:42:56.260 --> 2:43:00.260]  india company i mean i know all about them but tell folks why that's so important this
[2:43:00.260 --> 2:43:05.260]  modern model of the corporate fascism that's right that's where the united states as a
[2:43:05.260 --> 2:43:12.260]  corporation as a world of difference between the united states of america up until 1868
[2:43:12.260 --> 2:43:19.260]  and after 1868 we have a new operation called united states it's not a it's not a republic
[2:43:19.260 --> 2:43:25.260]  anymore it's called a public policy you know even the supreme court the head of the supreme
[2:43:25.260 --> 2:43:30.260]  court i've got a quote on my website or i'm gonna put it on if i don't have it where the
[2:43:30.260 --> 2:43:36.540]  head of the supreme court said that uh... the constitution of the united states was
[2:43:36.540 --> 2:43:45.580]  officially done away with an 1868 officially by law and 1868 period it has not been enforced
[2:43:45.580 --> 2:43:51.540]  it has not been of any value in this country or in this operation of this republic at
[2:43:51.540 --> 2:43:56.220]  all periods but now that they still kept the but they still kept some of the old conventions
[2:43:56.220 --> 2:44:02.380]  now they're fully doing away with it uh... even in practice a chattel property chattel
[2:44:02.380 --> 2:44:09.180]  property at you uh... it's movable it's movable dirt it's property it's like a real estate
[2:44:09.180 --> 2:44:14.820]  and part of the real estate is you could you live on the real estate so they refer to humans
[2:44:14.820 --> 2:44:20.660]  as uh... chattel property or movable dirt cognitive dissidents
[2:44:20.660 --> 2:44:25.940]  now cognitive dissidents is what the whole country this whole entire republic is filled
[2:44:25.940 --> 2:44:31.540]  with cognitive dissidents meaning uh... or if if you hear something that you've never
[2:44:31.540 --> 2:44:38.020]  heard before or is in opposition to something you've always believed your mind cannot be
[2:44:38.020 --> 2:44:43.020]  wrapped around that that that that information you just don't want to hear it you don't want
[2:44:43.020 --> 2:44:47.180]  to hear it because it doesn't have anything to do with what you believe and you have
[2:44:47.180 --> 2:44:52.180]  your own truth and so you don't want to look at the facts you can even deal with it so
[2:44:52.180 --> 2:44:55.940]  you like the fact that we told everybody there was mercury in there and the government said
[2:44:55.940 --> 2:44:59.700]  there's no mercury in the shots and now that they've had to admit okay at brand damage
[2:44:59.700 --> 2:45:05.020]  tens of millions and it is in there yeah i know it's uh... you know and like i said
[2:45:05.020 --> 2:45:10.020]  just but the slaves the slaves the slaves were told that it was not in there so they
[2:45:10.020 --> 2:45:15.620]  will default to the old line say i don't care the government admits it now i love it
[2:45:15.620 --> 2:45:21.820]  you know i know another word another word in the box of words to research congress
[2:45:21.820 --> 2:45:25.420]  we talk about the congress you have no idea the people have no idea in the world with
[2:45:25.420 --> 2:45:30.940]  the word congress really means tell them what it means now if you go to any good dictionary
[2:45:30.940 --> 2:45:38.060]  congress sex sex sex you have two words to call rough and then congress and you have
[2:45:38.060 --> 2:45:42.260]  the upper and lower house with the goddess and the male fellows coming together that's
[2:45:42.260 --> 2:45:48.580]  right the washington monument as a male erection and it and it connects directly to the overall
[2:45:48.580 --> 2:45:54.620]  of the ovaries of the oval office and that's why you have the congress because you've got
[2:45:54.620 --> 2:46:00.460]  the male phallic washington monument connecting to the oval ovaries oval basically we have
[2:46:00.460 --> 2:46:05.580]  a sun guy slash sex cult running things well it's the bottom line and they love killing
[2:46:05.580 --> 2:46:10.780]  people i know i don't know about the people of it the enjoyment of slaughtering like
[2:46:10.780 --> 2:46:15.380]  you or i would feel bad murdering masses of people especially children they they are very
[2:46:15.380 --> 2:46:19.860]  pious and say it's a very beautiful loving thing well i mean that one general said it
[2:46:19.860 --> 2:46:24.500]  was you know on my website i got that quote in the box of quotes as a picture of the
[2:46:24.500 --> 2:46:28.860]  general and testify where he said that one of the top generals in the middle east fed
[2:46:28.860 --> 2:46:34.500]  for american generals said yeah it's sometimes fun to kill people we kind of like it kind
[2:46:34.500 --> 2:46:39.820]  of fun shooting people it was kind of like a game see how many you can take down before
[2:46:39.820 --> 2:46:43.420]  lunch you know it's just kind of fun to kill people but then if you were going after his
[2:46:43.420 --> 2:46:48.740]  family you take it real serious oh no that's different because now you are a terrorist
[2:46:48.740 --> 2:46:53.380]  i mean i i i just don't know what to think about the whole world i live in anymore because
[2:46:53.380 --> 2:46:58.260]  i was gone crazy what was the inquisition and there was so many inquisitions yeah there's
[2:46:58.260 --> 2:47:06.020]  so many but basically the pope today rat zinger was they had before he became pope was the
[2:47:06.020 --> 2:47:12.700]  head of that organization in the Vatican that was we call the inquisition yeah that up keeps
[2:47:12.700 --> 2:47:16.980]  quote the doctor and that keeps the continuity of the church together yes and what it was
[2:47:16.980 --> 2:47:22.020]  doing the middle ages we call it the dark ages because the human race were going through
[2:47:22.020 --> 2:47:28.020]  things which were very dark and that's why we call it that time as the dark ages because
[2:47:28.020 --> 2:47:33.460]  we were in the really going to sell why are they trying to suppress all scientific knowledge
[2:47:33.460 --> 2:47:37.620]  we knew they'd hoarded it all and knew the truth why did they want to and now they want
[2:47:37.620 --> 2:47:42.940]  to the club of Rome the builder berg they say again they want a 10 percent of us to
[2:47:42.940 --> 2:47:47.900]  be living basically living on farms everybody else exterminated and then they'll be in high
[2:47:47.900 --> 2:47:53.580]  tech citadels basis separately from us well i know but that's that's exactly right but
[2:47:53.580 --> 2:48:01.220]  the inquisition was an extraordinarily important time in human history in europe when anyone
[2:48:01.220 --> 2:48:08.100]  who would even act like you're going to uh... that you are for liberty and justice and freedom
[2:48:08.100 --> 2:48:14.180]  freedom of thought freedom of religion freedom to think you were hunted down by the Vatican
[2:48:14.180 --> 2:48:20.020]  brought in and that we we know the stuff that went on the Vatican priest with poor hot lead
[2:48:20.020 --> 2:48:25.020]  in the children's faces in front of the parents they would open your mouth of the children's
[2:48:25.020 --> 2:48:30.460]  mouth and poor hot lead now we see that being repeated now psychologically they know when
[2:48:30.460 --> 2:48:35.900]  they do the wild house memos ordering the fb of the the joint season staff to tell them
[2:48:35.900 --> 2:48:41.300]  to torture children with pliers rip their genitals off uh... and then the public here's
[2:48:41.300 --> 2:48:46.020]  that an exception and says oh yeah that's jack bower that's a great journey of evil isn't
[2:48:46.020 --> 2:48:50.700]  it if they can get us to accept the most evil thing torturing children sexually then they've
[2:48:50.700 --> 2:48:54.820]  got us don't they jordan all right and they've got the whole human rights they've got the
[2:48:54.820 --> 2:49:00.540]  entire human rights go to any good law book here is so here's one of my uh... law and
[2:49:00.540 --> 2:49:06.540]  the words to research look up the word human being a human being according to this particular
[2:49:06.540 --> 2:49:14.180]  law book says uh... human being is a animal a monster then you look up the word monster
[2:49:14.180 --> 2:49:19.180]  and it would tell you a monster is uh... as a human being and has no rights to anything
[2:49:19.180 --> 2:49:22.940]  it's just an animal it's all a big joke to them that they've changed all the terms you

[2:54:57.020 --> 2:55:03.220]  order Jordan you know I I've heard it described as the great white brotherhood you know the
[2:55:03.220 --> 2:55:07.940]  council of 13 and we know it's there's less than a hundred really true initiates that
[2:55:07.940 --> 2:55:13.420]  have the full picture of their master plan but as best you can tell a who are a few of
[2:55:13.420 --> 2:55:20.780]  the top initiates to the most secret elite group what's the name of that group and will
[2:55:20.780 --> 2:55:26.500]  they be able to carry out their plans well look at all the only way I could answer that
[2:55:26.500 --> 2:55:31.060]  is that first of all I'm not privy to be on there on the inside to know the top people
[2:55:31.060 --> 2:55:38.260]  are but I've had enough experience when I got married you know the the the purse the
[2:55:38.260 --> 2:55:45.420]  person my wife was working for I learned a lot because I found out that so many of the
[2:55:45.420 --> 2:55:51.540]  people who are the real movers and shakers who are making things happen you will never
[2:55:51.540 --> 2:55:57.380]  know their names ever you will never hear their names ever and that all the people that
[2:55:57.380 --> 2:56:02.780]  you are hearing like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and all those people are not
[2:56:02.780 --> 2:56:09.660]  the real players the real players are are so much more powerful and so much more hidden
[2:56:09.660 --> 2:56:15.260]  you will never know who they really are they are they cannot afford to have their name
[2:56:15.260 --> 2:56:20.660]  or their face ever put out in public so I learned that a long time ago we know as far
[2:56:20.660 --> 2:56:27.220]  as dynasties go I mean you know you've got the the sax cover go to the British you've
[2:56:27.220 --> 2:56:33.180]  got the Rockefellers the Rothschilds certainly sit on large piles of the wealth but you're
[2:56:33.180 --> 2:56:38.980]  saying the true you know the true technocrats though that are really running the ship yeah
[2:56:38.980 --> 2:56:43.860]  are people you will never know who they are you will never see their names you will never
[2:56:43.860 --> 2:56:48.980]  hear their names spoken ever and those are the people who are really running the planet
[2:56:48.980 --> 2:56:55.060]  behind the scenes and like a classic example is the Vatican but the Vatican isn't the bottom
[2:56:55.060 --> 2:57:00.980]  line on on on this subject there are powers behind the Vatican there are there's just
[2:57:00.980 --> 2:57:07.460]  as there was behind the Caesar's of Rome Caesar's of Rome saw themselves as gods but in point
[2:57:07.460 --> 2:57:13.420]  of fact they had masters of their own and well you've always got the inner councils
[2:57:13.420 --> 2:57:18.860]  and the orders and then the bankers for it what's the real power behind the Vatican from
[2:57:18.860 --> 2:57:25.420]  well there was the during the time of the Roman Empire behind the Caesar's the Rothschilds
[2:57:25.420 --> 2:57:31.420]  of the Rockefeller types behind the Caesar's of Rome was called the Peacels family P I C

[3:08:57.380 --> 3:09:01.940]  and that dovetails uh... with other states like arizona
[3:09:01.940 --> 3:09:03.500]  one of the decodas
[3:09:03.500 --> 3:09:06.900]  new hampshire saying that the new world war continues or gun confiscation
[3:09:06.900 --> 3:09:07.780]  begins or

[3:09:23.420 --> 3:09:25.700]  when they're federalizing everything with our tax money
[3:09:25.700 --> 3:09:29.180]  they take our money that's in a few cents of the back with controls
[3:09:29.180 --> 3:09:31.780]  steamed over a perceived increase in federal
[3:09:31.780 --> 3:09:34.940]  usurping of states rights oklahoma house representatives told washington dc to
[3:09:34.940 --> 3:09:36.020]  back off
[3:09:36.020 --> 3:09:39.860]  joint resolution one zero eight nine passed by overwhelming ninety two to three
[3:09:39.860 --> 3:09:41.860]  margin
[3:09:41.860 --> 3:09:45.620]  reasserts oklahoma sovereignty under the tenth amendment to the u.s. constitution
[3:09:45.620 --> 3:09:48.020]  and according to the resolution's own language

[3:10:00.620 --> 3:10:02.060]  the people
[3:10:02.060 --> 3:10:04.300]  charles key the republican state representative who authored the
[3:10:04.300 --> 3:10:05.980]  resolution to world at daily
[3:10:05.980 --> 3:10:08.700]  they introduced it because he believes the federal governments overstepping its
[3:10:08.700 --> 3:10:09.460]  bounds
[3:10:09.460 --> 3:10:12.740]  has put our constitution in form of government in danger

[3:10:18.540 --> 3:10:21.300]  and you know stuff happened with members of the legislature and with the
[3:10:21.300 --> 3:10:22.540]  local mayor
[3:10:22.540 --> 3:10:24.020]  where they would say
[3:10:24.020 --> 3:10:27.140]  all i don't know anything about north american union and they catch them as
[3:10:27.140 --> 3:10:28.820]  signatories to it
[3:10:28.820 --> 3:10:30.220]  five years ago so
[3:10:30.220 --> 3:10:33.460]  a lot of that has got oklahoma's up in arms i wish we had
[3:10:33.460 --> 3:10:34.260]  people
[3:10:34.260 --> 3:10:37.320]  in our legislature like charles key here in texas
[3:10:37.320 --> 3:10:40.580]  where they're really raping the daylights out of us the feds are
[3:10:40.580 --> 3:10:43.680]  uh... but uh... charles key thank you so much for coming on with us
[3:10:43.680 --> 3:10:46.180]  it's good to be with you get alex

[3:10:49.540 --> 3:10:53.180]  about the local on the city bombing website this website your site

[3:10:56.620 --> 3:10:59.980]  to this resolution why it's a ray of hope
[3:10:59.980 --> 3:11:01.700]  well uh...
[3:11:01.700 --> 3:11:03.740]  you know this and just for some of your
[3:11:03.740 --> 3:11:05.380]  listeners to know i have
[3:11:05.380 --> 3:11:07.900]  i'm in my second tenure in the legislature had a
[3:11:07.900 --> 3:11:11.380]  previous life in the eighties and nineties in the legislature
[3:11:11.380 --> 3:11:13.860]  and i was out for about eight years i
[3:11:13.860 --> 3:11:17.620]  didn't really plan on running in what i did in o six and here i am
[3:11:17.620 --> 3:11:19.300]  uh... and
[3:11:19.300 --> 3:11:22.980]  the region had been on the show today hdr ten eighty nine which is the tenth
[3:11:22.980 --> 3:11:24.580]  amendment resolution
[3:11:24.580 --> 3:11:26.780]  did pass the house this year
[3:11:26.780 --> 3:11:30.060]  uh... but it's not brand new a lot it's new to a lot of people but it actually
[3:11:30.060 --> 3:11:31.540]  started back in the
[3:11:31.540 --> 3:11:33.180]  very early nineties
[3:11:33.180 --> 3:11:36.620]  there was a state senator from colorado charles duke
[3:11:36.620 --> 3:11:39.820]  and uh... he started that he gets credit was starting to give them a
[3:11:39.820 --> 3:11:41.460]  resolution but he
[3:11:41.460 --> 3:11:45.220]  and myself back then in a number of other legislators in other state
[3:11:45.220 --> 3:11:49.380]  legislatures introduced in their state legislatures and passed it back then
[3:11:49.380 --> 3:11:52.940]  i passed it in the oklahoma house back in nineteen ninety four yeah let's be
[3:11:52.940 --> 3:11:56.420]  clear you guys pass that instead the u n's not coming in here
[3:11:56.420 --> 3:11:58.700]  we're not putting up with land grabs and boom
[3:11:58.700 --> 3:12:02.080]  a little bombing happened to teach you to love the feds
[3:12:02.080 --> 3:12:04.500]  interesting times back then and uh...
[3:12:04.500 --> 3:12:07.940]  i'd love to take credit for this time this year but you know it it
[3:12:07.940 --> 3:12:10.660]  that does have a history that goes back into the nineties
[3:12:10.660 --> 3:12:14.220]  but it's something we definitely we must get out there
[3:12:14.220 --> 3:12:17.580]  uh... and get every state to pass the same resolution
[3:12:17.580 --> 3:12:21.340]  and i thought that you have got a lot of legislators that are contacting me
[3:12:21.340 --> 3:12:25.220]  insane they want to do the same thing in their legislature this next year
[3:12:25.220 --> 3:12:29.060]  and even got the people down there in texas
[3:12:29.060 --> 3:12:33.100]  well now i didn't know that uh... uh... i don't want to put you on the spot but
[3:12:33.100 --> 3:12:37.180]  you have in front of you who they are
[3:12:37.180 --> 3:12:40.260]  have their approval to talk about it on a public broadcast so just out of
[3:12:40.260 --> 3:12:42.660]  difference to them i think probably better if i didn't mention their names
[3:12:42.660 --> 3:12:45.300]  but uh... i guarantee there's real interest in the
[3:12:45.300 --> 3:12:48.580]  texas legislature got you we want to sneak up on them that makes
[3:12:48.580 --> 3:12:51.420]  that makes sense tell folks i've got it here in front of me but tell them
[3:12:51.420 --> 3:12:53.580]  where they can find the resolution to try to
[3:12:53.580 --> 3:12:56.800]  give it to their legislatures and tell us what's in the resolution
[3:12:56.800 --> 3:13:02.140]  why it's so important well first of all they could email me at charles dot key
[3:13:02.140 --> 3:13:04.780]  at ok house dot gov
[3:13:04.780 --> 3:13:08.460]  and request uh... you know a copy of the glad to send it to him or they go to
[3:13:08.460 --> 3:13:09.300]  the
[3:13:09.300 --> 3:13:13.020]  oklahoma house representatives website that's really easy to find it is a very
[3:13:13.020 --> 3:13:14.860]  user friendly website
[3:13:14.860 --> 3:13:20.460]  in just look up h j r one zero eight nine and you can download your own copy
[3:13:20.460 --> 3:13:23.220]  of it
[3:13:23.220 --> 3:13:25.940]  uh... tell us about some of the
[3:13:25.940 --> 3:13:29.620]  pun intended key areas of the uh... legislation
[3:13:29.620 --> 3:13:32.740]  well you know you've you pretty much described in the opening it is simply
[3:13:32.740 --> 3:13:35.980]  reiterates with the tenth amendment says and says federal government get back
[3:13:35.980 --> 3:13:37.860]  into your proper role
[3:13:37.860 --> 3:13:41.780]  and stop getting into areas that you have no legal authority to be into
[3:13:41.780 --> 3:13:43.500]  and my guys the list
[3:13:43.500 --> 3:13:45.420]  you know we don't have enough time in an hour
[3:13:45.420 --> 3:13:48.620]  we have spent all day long talking about what the federal government's done in
[3:13:48.620 --> 3:13:52.300]  venturing into areas that have no legal authority to go over some of the most
[3:13:52.300 --> 3:13:55.820]  egregious and why your your states upset
[3:13:55.820 --> 3:13:58.860]  you've got the uh... you know you've got the the
[3:13:58.860 --> 3:14:01.540]  violations of privacy the fourth amendment
[3:14:01.540 --> 3:14:04.460]  because of bills like the patriot act all the other ones that we've already
[3:14:04.460 --> 3:14:06.220]  forgot the names of them
[3:14:06.220 --> 3:14:08.140]  in which they tried and they have
[3:14:08.140 --> 3:14:10.220]  i'd like to say tried to restrict
[3:14:10.220 --> 3:14:12.620]  our rights of course they have
[3:14:12.620 --> 3:14:14.740]  but i think i have to be one that i don't
[3:14:14.740 --> 3:14:16.780]  uh... i don't believe in saying well
[3:14:16.780 --> 3:14:21.420]  there they they got us again you know they've eliminated another amendment
[3:14:21.420 --> 3:14:26.700]  uh... i think the supreme law of land is just that is the supreme law of land
[3:14:26.700 --> 3:14:29.260]  i agree it's still there just because they're criminal
[3:14:29.260 --> 3:14:31.260]  doesn't mean i'm still not a free human being
[3:14:31.260 --> 3:14:34.300]  yeah just because they pass a bill that mean all of a sudden they superseded
[3:14:34.300 --> 3:14:36.300]  it or something they got rid of it
[3:14:36.300 --> 3:14:39.980]  but you've got privacy you've got the surveillance
[3:14:39.980 --> 3:14:43.540]  uh... you've got ventures into the area of education
[3:14:43.540 --> 3:14:46.540]  you know they're telling people what to do and how to educate their kids from
[3:14:46.540 --> 3:14:48.180]  washington dc
[3:14:48.180 --> 3:14:52.660]  time funds to it to try to you know and all the problem started when the feds
[3:14:52.660 --> 3:14:53.580]  got involved
[3:14:53.580 --> 3:14:56.300]  yeah just gets worse don't get better
[3:14:56.300 --> 3:14:57.300]  uh...
[3:14:57.300 --> 3:14:59.420]  hate crimes uh...
[3:14:59.420 --> 3:15:02.460]  you know they had a bill this last year what that that gave a lot of money to
[3:15:02.460 --> 3:15:04.660]  hire more uh... law enforcement
[3:15:04.660 --> 3:15:05.740]  officers
[3:15:05.740 --> 3:15:07.020]  they don't have any right to
[3:15:07.020 --> 3:15:08.820]  to be doing that's not the role
[3:15:08.820 --> 3:15:12.740]  the right to be in that that particular area well i hear people all the time on
[3:15:12.740 --> 3:15:15.140]  talk radio even so called conservative say
[3:15:15.140 --> 3:15:16.860]  but it's free money
[3:15:16.860 --> 3:15:20.780]  no uh... in fact uh... from what i've seen federal money is the most uh...
[3:15:20.780 --> 3:15:22.900]  even if you agree with the programs which we don't
[3:15:22.900 --> 3:15:26.860]  i mean it is the most wasteful it's our money
[3:15:26.860 --> 3:15:28.740]  you know what there is an idea
[3:15:28.740 --> 3:15:30.220]  that uh... came up
[3:15:30.220 --> 3:15:33.820]  back in those early in middle nineties when some of us back then we're looking
[3:15:33.820 --> 3:15:34.340]  at
[3:15:34.340 --> 3:15:37.140]  what we could do to report the
[3:15:37.140 --> 3:15:39.300]  activity of the federal government
[3:15:39.300 --> 3:15:41.340]  in unconstitutional areas
[3:15:41.340 --> 3:15:44.140]  in this idea came up if anybody's listening out there that might want to
[3:15:44.140 --> 3:15:47.140]  pass us on to the legislator some of the legislators that listen to this
[3:15:47.140 --> 3:15:48.220]  program
[3:15:48.220 --> 3:15:50.380]  or people run for office
[3:15:50.380 --> 3:15:52.500]  you know it is our money
[3:15:52.500 --> 3:15:56.500]  and they're taking it and directed back to the states with kind of a carrot
[3:15:56.500 --> 3:15:58.300]  stick approach
[3:15:58.300 --> 3:16:01.060]  uh... you do this will give you this money than what you get hooked into the
[3:16:01.060 --> 3:16:04.480]  deal than they'll take the money when we should keep doing it and do more
[3:16:04.480 --> 3:16:07.780]  yeah unfunded mandates you know what if what if
[3:16:07.780 --> 3:16:11.220]  the state said okay look we're gonna start requiring our people within the
[3:16:11.220 --> 3:16:12.520]  state
[3:16:12.520 --> 3:16:17.340]  to send certain federal taxes to us through the state treasury
[3:16:17.340 --> 3:16:19.220]  and then we'll pass it on up to the
[3:16:19.220 --> 3:16:20.580]  federal government
[3:16:20.580 --> 3:16:24.380]  and that this is a real good money uh... generating the revenue generating
[3:16:24.380 --> 3:16:25.860]  idea by the way
[3:16:25.860 --> 3:16:29.060]  the states would have some short-term interest they'd make on that money as
[3:16:29.060 --> 3:16:30.860]  they floated through
[3:16:30.860 --> 3:16:33.180]  and that might really help some states out
[3:16:33.180 --> 3:16:35.420]  but it would also allow the state to say to
[3:16:35.420 --> 3:16:37.060]  the federal government when they start
[3:16:37.060 --> 3:16:38.220]  pushing more
[3:16:38.220 --> 3:16:42.500]  unfunded mandates and unconstitutional acts so well maybe we won't send that money
[3:16:42.500 --> 3:16:43.500]  up
[3:16:43.500 --> 3:16:45.860]  back up to you will just keep it
[3:16:45.860 --> 3:16:49.060]  home and they need to start doing something like that
[3:16:49.060 --> 3:16:52.220]  because it is our money
[3:16:52.220 --> 3:16:54.020]  well it certainly is
[3:16:54.020 --> 3:16:57.100]  uh... what are some other areas other you think are important people know
[3:16:57.100 --> 3:16:59.700]  about uh... dealing with the
[3:16:59.700 --> 3:17:02.820]  uh... declaration
[3:17:02.820 --> 3:17:04.380]  well uh...
[3:17:04.380 --> 3:17:07.180]  you know the big issues out there well the big issues that have been talked
[3:17:07.180 --> 3:17:08.780]  about for several years
[3:17:08.780 --> 3:17:11.940]  i think uh... it's gotten prominent again this time around because of the
[3:17:11.940 --> 3:17:13.620]  ron paul campaign
[3:17:13.620 --> 3:17:17.900]  is the the money issue the authority given to the federal reserve private
[3:17:17.900 --> 3:17:19.340]  reserve bank
[3:17:19.340 --> 3:17:22.620]  to have control over just about every aspect of our lives have to do with
[3:17:22.620 --> 3:17:24.420]  finances and money
[3:17:24.420 --> 3:17:28.820]  that uh... is proving that finally proving to be a really big problem
[3:17:28.820 --> 3:17:32.580]  they don't have the authority to do that it's unconstitutional
[3:17:32.580 --> 3:17:35.420]  and that needs to be addressed well now they're saying the federal reserve
[3:17:35.420 --> 3:17:37.740]  has issued so much currency and liquidity that
[3:17:37.740 --> 3:17:39.900]  the dollar is going to be like toilet paper
[3:17:39.900 --> 3:17:41.660]  well it's
[3:17:41.660 --> 3:17:44.260]  you know it's it seems to be in that way i mean
[3:17:44.260 --> 3:17:48.420]  it's pretty bad right now with the mazes me and really makes me mad is a lot
[3:17:48.420 --> 3:17:49.860]  of these talking head
[3:17:49.860 --> 3:17:52.100]  condense and people in both parties
[3:17:52.100 --> 3:17:52.860]  that make
[3:17:52.860 --> 3:17:55.740]  because of money and live off the system for a long time
[3:17:55.740 --> 3:17:58.500]  they don't have a clue how tough it is for the average
[3:17:58.500 --> 3:18:02.140]  middle and lower income person out here trying to get by they think
[3:18:02.140 --> 3:18:05.500]  everybody still making a couple hundred thousand more dollars a year and
[3:18:05.500 --> 3:18:06.660]  and everything's work
[3:18:06.660 --> 3:18:07.860]  real rosy
[3:18:07.860 --> 3:18:10.060]  but the country is hurting right now
[3:18:10.060 --> 3:18:14.460]  and uh... it can get a lot worse than it might but that needs to be fixed and
[3:18:14.460 --> 3:18:17.740]  uh... the answer is not to print more dollars up trophy
[3:18:17.740 --> 3:18:19.300]  you know coins back towards
[3:18:19.300 --> 3:18:22.660]  the folks with some type of a tax rebate or something
[3:18:22.660 --> 3:18:25.460]  but that issue needs to be addressed we've also got the problem of just
[3:18:25.460 --> 3:18:27.220]  taxation itself
[3:18:27.220 --> 3:18:30.780]  the federal income tax is a is a bad tax
[3:18:30.780 --> 3:18:33.580]  but it's not that's not a legal tax
[3:18:33.580 --> 3:18:34.700]  supreme court
[3:18:34.700 --> 3:18:36.660]  once in our history at least as
[3:18:36.660 --> 3:18:39.060]  real that it was not constitutional
[3:18:39.060 --> 3:18:40.780]  if a court had the
[3:18:40.780 --> 3:18:42.740]  had the uh...
[3:18:42.740 --> 3:18:48.100]  or what the courage or the uh... will come will the constitutional
[3:18:48.100 --> 3:18:52.540]  uh... knowledge or whatever it would ever is pulling them back from really
[3:18:52.540 --> 3:18:53.860]  on this issue
[3:18:53.860 --> 3:18:55.620]  but they just need an opportunity
[3:18:55.620 --> 3:18:59.540]  they ought to rule again that the federal income tax is unconstitutional
[3:18:59.540 --> 3:19:01.700]  absolutely tax
[3:19:01.700 --> 3:19:04.180]  uh... you know it's just hard to believe that a state would have to pass a
[3:19:04.180 --> 3:19:08.020]  re-resolution saying the state of oklahoma hereby claims sovereignty
[3:19:08.020 --> 3:19:11.540]  under the tenth amendment to the constitution states overall powers
[3:19:11.540 --> 3:19:14.460]  otherwise enumerated and granted the federal government
[3:19:14.460 --> 3:19:16.540]  by the constitution states
[3:19:16.540 --> 3:19:19.940]  and you serve notice and demand of the federal government as our agent
[3:19:19.940 --> 3:19:22.700]  the cease and desist effective immediately mandates
[3:19:22.700 --> 3:19:26.580]  that are beyond the scope of these constitutionally delegated powers
[3:19:26.580 --> 3:19:28.740]  federalizing local police
[3:19:28.740 --> 3:19:32.500]  i mean folks the government is out of control the federal government
[3:19:32.500 --> 3:19:35.860]  it's like a neighbor who's in your house telling you what to do i mean it is

[3:20:48.260 --> 3:20:51.980]  reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with
[3:20:51.980 --> 3:20:55.700]  catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[3:20:55.700 --> 3:20:58.620]  place limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their
[3:20:58.620 --> 3:21:02.380]  accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your
[3:21:02.380 --> 3:21:05.780]  deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will
[3:21:05.780 --> 3:21:09.340]  skyrocket through f d i c if the government is forced to ensure deposits
[3:21:09.340 --> 3:21:13.020]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is
[3:21:13.020 --> 3:21:16.940]  underway by the fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for
[3:21:16.940 --> 3:21:20.740]  depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and
[3:21:20.740 --> 3:21:25.060]  productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability
[3:21:25.060 --> 3:21:29.460]  i recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned
[3:21:29.460 --> 3:21:33.060]  into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been driven

[3:23:59.900 --> 3:24:06.220]  state rep charles key is our guest talk about courage from day one when there was the
[3:24:06.220 --> 3:24:12.020]  questions coming out with Oklahoma City bombing which was an inside job from the
[3:24:12.020 --> 3:24:17.540]  beginning he was there questioning exposing speaking out and now in
[3:24:17.540 --> 3:24:25.580]  hindsight talking 12 years later or more it's just all coming out it is all
[3:24:25.580 --> 3:24:29.060]  coming out in a big way so I want to shift years into that for the rest of
[3:24:29.060 --> 3:24:32.380]  the interview with our guest today and any other subjects he wants to talk about
[3:24:32.380 --> 3:24:37.620]  but as a state rep for all our listeners in Oklahoma please support him's give
[3:24:37.620 --> 3:24:42.700]  a I mean I know he was happy to be out of politics why did you get back in well
[3:24:42.700 --> 3:24:46.780]  it was just kind of circumstantial there was some people that asked me to run
[3:24:46.780 --> 3:24:50.300]  when the guy that was in there just chose not to run kind of about the
[3:24:50.300 --> 3:24:56.460]  somewhat the last minute and you know that was just that simple that there was
[3:24:56.460 --> 3:24:59.540]  another guy running that some of them didn't think he was a conservative and
[3:24:59.540 --> 3:25:03.820]  and I said we want a conservative in there we've got to have a conservative we
[3:25:03.820 --> 3:25:08.380]  want you to run and so I thought about it prayed about it boom did it and they
[3:25:08.380 --> 3:25:11.100]  did the same thing they did to me before they just blew me out of the water
[3:25:11.100 --> 3:25:15.180]  about about the Oklahoma City bombing but we prevailed and God gave us a
[3:25:15.180 --> 3:25:21.500]  victory so that's that's just it yeah they attack you when most Oklahomans I
[3:25:21.500 --> 3:25:25.620]  talked to know what's going on I mean did that backfire on them that the
[3:25:25.620 --> 3:25:30.140]  story's gotten out now and that that made your competitors look stupid yeah I
[3:25:30.140 --> 3:25:33.780]  think it is I think you know it's a lot like this Oklahoma City bombing cases
[3:25:33.780 --> 3:25:37.900]  a lot like JFK a lot a lot of other cases that we could enumerate you talk
[3:25:37.900 --> 3:25:41.820]  about on your program have many times you know as time goes by more the truth
[3:25:41.820 --> 3:25:46.660]  comes out people have time the emotional part of it you know subsides it goes away
[3:25:46.660 --> 3:25:51.580]  people have a chance to hear more think more and get more facts and they
[3:25:51.580 --> 3:25:55.500]  realized that there was a cover-up and that's what's happened in the Oklahoma
[3:25:55.500 --> 3:25:59.620]  City bombing case yeah I guess you probably had Jesse Trinidad on your
[3:25:59.620 --> 3:26:04.460]  program oh yes and and that guy talk about it you know a bulldog and a
[3:26:04.460 --> 3:26:09.340]  courageous man he has continued to keep this thing alive and he is you know he
[3:26:09.340 --> 3:26:15.180]  has helped continue to verify what all of us were saying back in the beginning
[3:26:15.180 --> 3:26:18.620]  well that's it 10 11 years ago everything you said has turned out your
[3:26:18.620 --> 3:26:22.860]  angle on it's turned out to be right and in fact break down the Jesse Trinidad
[3:26:22.860 --> 3:26:25.460]  case for those that may have forgotten because that was probably six eight
[3:26:25.460 --> 3:26:28.420]  months ago we were really talking about this I mean break down all the new
[3:26:28.420 --> 3:26:32.060]  things that have been confirmed well and I it's been hard for me to keep on
[3:26:32.060 --> 3:26:35.420]  top of it like I did the bombing case was involved in that but I can get the
[3:26:35.420 --> 3:26:40.300]  highlights Jesse Trinidad is an attorney up in the Salt Lake City area he had a
[3:26:40.300 --> 3:26:45.380]  brother who died in Oklahoma City in August of 95 the bombing happened in
[3:26:45.380 --> 3:26:49.620]  April in his brother died in a federal transfer center that happened to be in
[3:26:49.620 --> 3:26:55.980]  my district by the way right next to the airport and the one the family realized
[3:26:55.980 --> 3:26:59.460]  that he didn't commit suicide like the Bureau of Prisons claimed so they
[3:26:59.460 --> 3:27:05.540]  filed a lawsuit as time went by and they were able to force documents out of the
[3:27:05.540 --> 3:27:08.980]  government look through the Freedom of Information Act they found out that it
[3:27:08.980 --> 3:27:14.100]  was related to the Oklahoma City bombing somehow what happened was some
[3:27:14.100 --> 3:27:19.420]  federal investigators FBI and who knows who else thought that he was a suspect
[3:27:19.420 --> 3:27:24.660]  in the Oklahoma City bombing case and they beat him to death literally and so
[3:27:24.660 --> 3:27:29.380]  the family filed suit they visually won that suit and the Trinidad and the
[3:27:29.380 --> 3:27:34.140]  family have not let go they've become impassioned not just well let me just
[3:27:34.140 --> 3:27:38.740]  add he also had electrical burns all over him yeah go ahead and they're
[3:27:38.740 --> 3:27:43.580]  impassioned about this not just because they wanted to bring justice to what
[3:27:43.580 --> 3:27:49.140]  really happened in regards to their brother and son's murder but also because
[3:27:49.140 --> 3:27:54.420]  they found out how terrible terribly screwed up this Oklahoma City bombing
[3:27:54.420 --> 3:27:58.780]  case was and what the other truth was really being covered up so Jesse
[3:27:58.780 --> 3:28:02.980]  Trinidad and you know we should also give kudos to a federal judge at the
[3:28:02.980 --> 3:28:07.820]  Salt Lake area I think his last name is Kimball has not let the Justice
[3:28:07.820 --> 3:28:12.420]  Department in the FBI off the hook easy made them have to live under the laws
[3:28:12.420 --> 3:28:16.340]  that the rest of us have to live and he said things like this is a cover up I
[3:28:16.340 --> 3:28:20.460]  mean it's amazing to have a actually have a good federal judge yeah you know
[3:28:20.460 --> 3:28:26.500]  even the judge a mage that presided over McVey and in nickels trials even made a
[3:28:26.500 --> 3:28:31.140]  couple of comments like that back early on so there's no question about that it
[3:28:31.140 --> 3:28:34.820]  was a major cover-up and it was there were other people involved and they had
[3:28:34.820 --> 3:28:39.660]  a level at minimum a level of prior knowledge that something was going to
[3:28:39.660 --> 3:28:44.660]  happen and you know there were government informants inside the circle or
[3:28:44.660 --> 3:28:48.820]  these circles of individuals that were you know going to carry this out of
[3:28:48.820 --> 3:28:52.660]  there were participating in it and you know the list just goes on but how could
[3:28:52.660 --> 3:28:56.980]  you be criticized when you had grand jurors and people coming to you saying
[3:28:56.980 --> 3:29:00.420]  there's other bombers and I'm being told to shut up I mean that's your job as a
[3:29:00.420 --> 3:29:06.940]  state rep to speak out well you know there are folks that they want to go
[3:29:06.940 --> 3:29:10.140]  along they're more interested in climbing up a ladder whether it's
[3:29:10.140 --> 3:29:15.740]  politically or corporately or whatever and that's what it gets down to stay
[3:29:15.740 --> 3:29:19.220]  there I want to run through the basics of what you know about that one city
[3:29:19.220 --> 3:29:23.460]  bombing and who you think is really behind it and involved we've got a clear
[3:29:23.460 --> 3:29:27.100]  picture today we've ever had before and we'll take calls on the resolution

[3:33:31.420 --> 3:33:35.500]  thanks to Bush tripling the size of government now we're looking at Barack
[3:33:35.500 --> 3:33:40.780]  Obama or McCain Charles before we get back in Oklahoma City and take calls
[3:33:40.780 --> 3:33:45.260]  sometimes you gotta wonder I mean the elites are just running this country into
[3:33:45.260 --> 3:33:50.100]  the ground and and I'm just wondering if there's any hope the way things are
[3:33:50.100 --> 3:33:55.740]  going hope if you know I think there's always hope but I feel the same way I'm
[3:33:55.740 --> 3:34:01.180]  I get discouraged and down but as long as we you know we have a certain amount of
[3:34:01.180 --> 3:34:05.700]  freedom and we still do in this country but back to the 10th amendment you were
[3:34:05.700 --> 3:34:08.820]  talking about the Oklahoma City bombing and how they could attack somebody or
[3:34:08.820 --> 3:34:13.980]  criticize them for just asking questions and wanting some truth we'll look at
[3:34:13.980 --> 3:34:17.140]  McCain find gold and a lot of the other things they've done over the past few
[3:34:17.140 --> 3:34:21.860]  years to just try and control your ability to speak freely like on this
[3:34:21.860 --> 3:34:25.420]  radio program because there are those that don't want to even talk about this
[3:34:25.420 --> 3:34:29.620]  and that's what they do one of the one of the things they do is they will they
[3:34:29.620 --> 3:34:34.500]  will attack you publicly and call you all kinds of names you know and spin off
[3:34:34.500 --> 3:34:41.180]  the truth and tell a lot of untruths and since since the Oklahoma City bombing
[3:34:41.180 --> 3:34:45.460]  just look at the legislation that's been passed to restrict what you can say and
[3:34:45.460 --> 3:34:49.700]  where you can say it you know there's where they call them speech-free zones
[3:34:49.700 --> 3:34:54.220]  if you get in some of those zones when there's a presidential motorcade or the
[3:34:54.220 --> 3:34:59.020]  president's there or some other political activity that they don't want any
[3:34:59.020 --> 3:35:02.140]  protesters to be around what do they do they'll haul you off and throw you in
[3:35:02.140 --> 3:35:06.340]  jail well look at Nancy Pelosi the first thing they did after but I'll just say
[3:35:06.340 --> 3:35:11.380]  after the Clintons bombed okc after the feds did the first thing they did was
[3:35:11.380 --> 3:35:15.020]  say we need to bring back the fairness doctrine and reduce free speech on talk
[3:35:15.020 --> 3:35:16.900]  radio they blame talk radio
[3:35:16.900 --> 3:35:21.460]  and now Pelosi says she wants to bring that back
[3:35:21.460 --> 3:35:24.460]  and i think you know i hear more and more people what's been interesting in
[3:35:24.460 --> 3:35:27.420]  my experience coming back into the legislative
[3:35:27.420 --> 3:35:30.100]  political realm this last couple years
[3:35:30.100 --> 3:35:33.900]  is what i want not doors and oh six running for this seat again
[3:35:33.900 --> 3:35:35.780]  it was very very uh...
[3:35:35.780 --> 3:35:39.500]  surprising to me and encouraging very encouraging
[3:35:39.500 --> 3:35:44.260]  how many people going door to door the republicans are the only doors are not
[3:35:44.260 --> 3:35:47.620]  that are very aware of what's going on in this country there's a great awakening
[3:35:47.620 --> 3:35:49.860]  will see that's what i was going to ask you next
[3:35:49.860 --> 3:35:52.380]  whereas things are getting darkest for the dawn
[3:35:52.380 --> 3:35:56.340]  i'm saying they're bad i'm finding the same thing that people finally are
[3:35:56.340 --> 3:35:58.180]  knowing they're finally listening
[3:35:58.180 --> 3:35:59.820]  go ahead and finish your story tell me
[3:35:59.820 --> 3:36:01.820]  what happened when you knocked on those doors
[3:36:01.820 --> 3:36:05.140]  that people people are aware they're getting their information from someplace
[3:36:05.140 --> 3:36:06.260]  other than
[3:36:06.260 --> 3:36:08.260]  the nightly news in the newspaper
[3:36:08.260 --> 3:36:10.940]  and they're starting to find out that they're getting lied to
[3:36:10.940 --> 3:36:14.420]  and there's something really rotten in Denmark so to speak and that they're
[3:36:14.420 --> 3:36:15.380]  waking up
[3:36:15.380 --> 3:36:18.940]  they understand part of a lot of this is is pretty obvious stuff like when you
[3:36:18.940 --> 3:36:19.740]  got
[3:36:19.740 --> 3:36:22.060]  the immigration problems like we have
[3:36:22.060 --> 3:36:25.820]  and you've got a government that refuses to do something about it
[3:36:25.820 --> 3:36:30.060]  or so many and all well i had i've got news articles with the police admit
[3:36:30.060 --> 3:36:32.980]  that the name of any legal can be drunk and they don't arrest them but they
[3:36:32.980 --> 3:36:33.900]  arrest me
[3:36:33.900 --> 3:36:37.060]  now they should arrest me but they won't arrest them i mean they're like
[3:36:37.060 --> 3:36:38.300]  superclass
[3:36:38.300 --> 3:36:40.620]  they arrest congressman who were drunk
[3:36:40.620 --> 3:36:43.980]  well you know there's so many people in this this is a part of the answer to
[3:36:43.980 --> 3:36:46.220]  what happened in the oklahoma city case when
[3:36:46.220 --> 3:36:49.820]  they came after me in other cases that other people have been involved in
[3:36:49.820 --> 3:36:53.260]  there's always a section of people and i talked about this on your program years
[3:36:53.260 --> 3:36:54.100]  ago
[3:36:54.100 --> 3:36:57.300]  there's always a percentage of the people when they hear things like a cover-up
[3:36:57.300 --> 3:36:59.780]  about oklahoma city or anything else
[3:36:59.780 --> 3:37:03.700]  they do not want to hear it it they put so much fear into them
[3:37:03.700 --> 3:37:07.260]  and their reaction is they want to kill the messenger
[3:37:07.260 --> 3:37:10.220]  and they'll go along they'll be cheerleaders
[3:37:10.220 --> 3:37:13.820]  and accomplices with those who attacked the messenger
[3:37:13.820 --> 3:37:16.620]  and that's how they accomplish what they accomplished but
[3:37:16.620 --> 3:37:19.940]  even those people will wake up as time goes on
[3:37:19.940 --> 3:37:23.340]  because they'll come out of their denial because after a while they'll see
[3:37:23.340 --> 3:37:25.420]  and this is what i think i'm seeing today
[3:37:25.420 --> 3:37:27.420]  more people starting to wake up
[3:37:27.420 --> 3:37:30.020]  and realize that it really is something too
[3:37:30.020 --> 3:37:33.180]  that's you know what he said or what will i agree with you because what i run
[3:37:33.180 --> 3:37:34.140]  into is
[3:37:34.140 --> 3:37:36.860]  there's a certain amount of people who want to live in denial and sever things
[3:37:36.860 --> 3:37:38.340]  fine no matter what's going on
[3:37:38.340 --> 3:37:42.220]  they say we're being negative no no no we're trying to protect what's good
[3:37:42.220 --> 3:37:43.900]  by admitting what's bad
[3:37:43.900 --> 3:37:46.580]  you know it's like if i have a fly in my soup i don't say all i'm not going to
[3:37:46.580 --> 3:37:47.740]  be negative and eat it
[3:37:47.740 --> 3:37:49.820]  i take the fly out
[3:37:49.820 --> 3:37:53.620]  well one of our investigators uh... uses analogy and i love it i've used it a
[3:37:53.620 --> 3:37:56.460]  lot of times back when we were investigating the bombing
[3:37:56.460 --> 3:37:58.340]  he was a retired uh...
[3:37:58.340 --> 3:38:00.100]  officer in the marine corps
[3:38:00.100 --> 3:38:02.180]  uh... good guy and he said you know i
[3:38:02.180 --> 3:38:03.740]  is a child of this like
[3:38:03.740 --> 3:38:07.260]  it's like a ship he says most people notice when a ship starts taking on water
[3:38:07.260 --> 3:38:10.140]  in the ocean you think it would just you know
[3:38:10.140 --> 3:38:11.180]  going over
[3:38:11.180 --> 3:38:14.180]  they said it actually gets to be about seventeen degrees
[3:38:14.180 --> 3:38:16.100]  that's what he said i'm assuming it's true
[3:38:16.100 --> 3:38:16.860]  or accurate
[3:38:16.860 --> 3:38:18.820]  it's about seventeen degrees
[3:38:18.820 --> 3:38:19.420]  and it just
[3:38:19.420 --> 3:38:20.860]  flops on over
[3:38:20.860 --> 3:38:23.660]  and he said that's how this public opinion and things will happen some
[3:38:23.660 --> 3:38:24.460]  days
[3:38:24.460 --> 3:38:27.020]  it you know just keep mounting and mounting until
[3:38:27.020 --> 3:38:30.460]  all of a sudden the people wake up no i don't think that's what they're afraid
[3:38:30.460 --> 3:38:32.140]  of it's a flash point
[3:38:32.140 --> 3:38:36.260]  it's a flash point it it it it it it happens in jumps
[3:38:36.260 --> 3:38:40.140]  and and those that are what you know we we recognize in our that
[3:38:40.140 --> 3:38:44.020]  there are enemies that are enemies of of a constitutional form of government
[3:38:44.020 --> 3:38:47.340]  they know that they're afraid of it
[3:38:47.340 --> 3:38:49.460]  and we need to use that to our advantage
[3:38:49.460 --> 3:38:53.220]  i agree well i'll tell you this globalist is five years ago six years ago
[3:38:53.220 --> 3:38:56.700]  still were arrogant i look at their body language now i go to events
[3:38:56.700 --> 3:38:59.980]  they look freaked out but i don't think it's even freaked out about us as much
[3:38:59.980 --> 3:39:01.060]  as it is
[3:39:01.060 --> 3:39:04.060]  a lot of economists i talk to think they've lost control
[3:39:04.060 --> 3:39:07.860]  uh... that that that that they have just totally screwed everything up
[3:39:07.860 --> 3:39:10.420]  and that's another thing that wakes people up unfortunately could we've
[3:39:10.420 --> 3:39:13.260]  heard that you know all of our lives could be true that there's a lot of
[3:39:13.260 --> 3:39:15.620]  people that never will wake up until
[3:39:15.620 --> 3:39:18.900]  you know they're back pocket you know the pocketbook gets hit hard enough in
[3:39:18.900 --> 3:39:20.620]  the people are getting hit hard
[3:39:20.620 --> 3:39:23.820]  it's a lot more than a wake up for that reason it's unfortunate
[3:39:23.820 --> 3:39:27.540]  uh... but if if it works for us that's fine you know we need everything to our
[3:39:27.540 --> 3:39:28.980]  advantage that we can get
[3:39:28.980 --> 3:39:29.940]  yeah but it
[3:39:29.940 --> 3:39:31.540]  looks like the pocketbook that
[3:39:31.540 --> 3:39:34.820]  if they think this is bad they ain't see nothing yet as they say
[3:39:34.820 --> 3:39:38.420]  i mean if it if this continues it it's going to be unbelievable
[3:39:38.420 --> 3:39:41.420]  uh... let's talk to steven colorado you're on the air with uh... charles
[3:39:41.420 --> 3:39:42.980]  key state rep
[3:39:42.980 --> 3:39:43.620]  well
[3:39:43.620 --> 3:39:46.420]  hello there alex hi hello representative key
[3:39:46.420 --> 3:39:48.020]  uh... i think one of the
[3:39:48.020 --> 3:39:51.580]  main reasons why people want to shoot the messenger so much is because
[3:39:51.580 --> 3:39:54.780]  they don't want to actually have to believe that they're that their government
[3:39:54.780 --> 3:39:56.100]  is degraded in
[3:39:56.100 --> 3:39:59.020]  into such a despicable situation
[3:39:59.020 --> 3:40:01.780]  and then also another reason is because they might actually have to do
[3:40:01.780 --> 3:40:04.700]  something with the knowledge that they found out
[3:40:04.700 --> 3:40:05.860]  yeah i agree with it
[3:40:05.860 --> 3:40:07.620]  but then they might find out
[3:40:07.620 --> 3:40:10.580]  how bad it's going to be if they don't do something then they really would do
[3:40:10.580 --> 3:40:11.500]  something
[3:40:11.500 --> 3:40:14.260]  and well that's an interesting point too
[3:40:14.260 --> 3:40:15.940]  and my questions were
[3:40:15.940 --> 3:40:17.140]  uh... is there
[3:40:17.140 --> 3:40:20.300]  i had heard story the story i guess about
[3:40:20.300 --> 3:40:22.860]  uh... helicopters taking
[3:40:22.860 --> 3:40:25.180]  uh... some of the federal people
[3:40:25.180 --> 3:40:29.020]  off the roof of the fat of the the murab building
[3:40:29.020 --> 3:40:31.940]  uh... is that do you know that to be true at all
[3:40:31.940 --> 3:40:34.660]  uh... i mean prior to prior to the blast
[3:40:34.660 --> 3:40:37.460]  no never found any truth of that there were
[3:40:37.460 --> 3:40:38.220]  there were
[3:40:38.220 --> 3:40:39.620]  stories that were
[3:40:39.620 --> 3:40:42.900]  you know here say i mean uh... you know nothing we can really get a lot
[3:40:42.900 --> 3:40:45.260]  wouldn't they just walk out the front
[3:40:45.260 --> 3:40:48.220]  well because they didn't want to alarm anybody from what i understand they
[3:40:48.220 --> 3:40:50.100]  went out of rooftop exit
[3:40:50.100 --> 3:40:53.180]  uh... by helicopter with alarm people
[3:40:53.180 --> 3:40:57.420]  well that that's just what i heard i i didn't know for sure whether that was
[3:40:57.420 --> 3:40:59.060]  or whether that was true
[3:40:59.060 --> 3:41:03.100]  but yeah uh... we don't know that i don't know if it's a way to prove that
[3:41:03.100 --> 3:41:07.340]  we worked real hard at that and some so many other clues and
[3:41:07.340 --> 3:41:10.380]  you know information that we had and we never could we had people that said they
[3:41:10.380 --> 3:41:12.900]  saw helicopters before the bombing
[3:41:12.900 --> 3:41:16.100]  it immediately after the the bombs went off but
[3:41:16.100 --> 3:41:19.980]  there again you know proving it and proving that there's anything
[3:41:19.980 --> 3:41:21.780]  connected bombing is another thing
[3:41:21.780 --> 3:41:24.620]  by the way operative word bombings thank you steve
[3:41:24.620 --> 3:41:28.220]  uh... we know there were multiple bombs uh... can you explain how you can say
[3:41:28.220 --> 3:41:29.540]  that uh...
[3:41:29.540 --> 3:41:31.780]  whether just too many experts you know this
[3:41:31.780 --> 3:41:35.220]  this is uh... a subject that is difficult for most people because they
[3:41:35.220 --> 3:41:38.300]  don't understand all this and i was one of those
[3:41:38.300 --> 3:41:39.380]  i learned a lot like
[3:41:39.380 --> 3:41:41.060]  learn a lot more than i ever would have
[3:41:41.060 --> 3:41:44.380]  you know uh... if i had been involved in bombing but you've got experts people
[3:41:44.380 --> 3:41:47.540]  have done this all their lives like general partner many others
[3:41:47.540 --> 3:41:50.340]  and we've got some of those in that report that we published
[3:41:50.340 --> 3:41:53.460]  that come out and analyze and this is what they do for a living they've done
[3:41:53.460 --> 3:41:55.740]  it all their lives in military and
[3:41:55.740 --> 3:41:57.700]  in commercial application
[3:41:57.700 --> 3:42:02.420]  uh... they analyze terrorist bombs uh... bombings they analyze
[3:42:02.420 --> 3:42:06.140]  uh... test that they do like an egl in air force that basis been talked about a
[3:42:06.140 --> 3:42:06.940]  lot
[3:42:06.940 --> 3:42:07.980]  and they know how these
[3:42:07.980 --> 3:42:08.780]  how these
[3:42:08.780 --> 3:42:12.500]  things work and what will it won't happen and they can analyze
[3:42:12.500 --> 3:42:13.860]  a case like this
[3:42:13.860 --> 3:42:15.020]  and say well here's
[3:42:15.020 --> 3:42:17.360]  what happened you know here's how many bombs
[3:42:17.360 --> 3:42:20.420]  were used here's where they were placed center center
[3:42:20.420 --> 3:42:23.260]  the experts have looked at analyzed it
[3:42:23.260 --> 3:42:30.260]  and concluded that multiple bombs were used
[3:42:32.540 --> 3:42:38.340]  am i still on
[3:42:38.340 --> 3:42:42.740]  so i that's how we know uh... about the number of bombs
[3:42:42.740 --> 3:42:44.020]  uh... people i come
[3:42:44.020 --> 3:42:47.100]  general partner others
[3:42:47.100 --> 3:42:50.580]  uh... sorry i was in a mess on my board uh...
[3:42:50.580 --> 3:42:51.940]  representative key
[3:42:51.940 --> 3:42:55.860]  uh... going back to the b a t f what we do know is
[3:42:55.860 --> 3:42:57.860]  they showed up in their bomb gear
[3:42:57.860 --> 3:43:00.220]  seconds after the blast and we're telling
[3:43:00.220 --> 3:43:03.820]  uh... m t's and people that showed up to dress wounds and say that they'd seen
[3:43:03.820 --> 3:43:04.460]  them
[3:43:04.460 --> 3:43:05.980]  up in the higher floors
[3:43:05.980 --> 3:43:08.540]  what do you think was behind that
[3:43:08.540 --> 3:43:11.220]  well it's pretty interesting you know you had uh...
[3:43:11.220 --> 3:43:16.340]  an a p reporters been around for a long time and he gave
[3:43:16.340 --> 3:43:19.060]  testimony on videotape
[3:43:19.060 --> 3:43:21.180]  that he was immediately on the scene
[3:43:21.180 --> 3:43:23.780]  and he said immediately these uh...
[3:43:23.780 --> 3:43:24.940]  a t f
[3:43:24.940 --> 3:43:28.340]  officials showed up with the black gear you know
[3:43:28.340 --> 3:43:31.740]  all decked out their black uh... swat team type gear
[3:43:31.740 --> 3:43:32.420]  elect
[3:43:32.420 --> 3:43:34.740]  they were poised ready for this to happen
[3:43:34.740 --> 3:43:38.660]  and that's where uh... that information comes from also
[3:43:38.660 --> 3:43:40.500]  related to that is
[3:43:40.500 --> 3:43:44.140]  the oakland city fire department getting some call the friday before the
[3:43:44.140 --> 3:43:45.620]  wednesday bombing
[3:43:45.620 --> 3:43:46.700]  about
[3:43:46.700 --> 3:43:50.900]  uh... them being in in a park higher prepared state for something that may be
[3:43:50.900 --> 3:43:52.020]  developing
[3:43:52.020 --> 3:43:55.860]  over the next several days and then we also have the b a t f out at a base
[3:43:55.860 --> 3:43:57.940]  testing blowing up trucks
[3:43:57.940 --> 3:44:00.320]  you know and uh... new mexico were
[3:44:00.320 --> 3:44:03.460]  blowing up trucks with info bombs
[3:44:03.460 --> 3:44:05.460]  very interesting also
[3:44:05.460 --> 3:44:06.620]  to say the least
[3:44:06.620 --> 3:44:09.140]  and and this is in the months before of course you're not just saying the
[3:44:09.140 --> 3:44:10.940]  experts say multiple bombs or
[3:44:10.940 --> 3:44:11.780]  how does it
[3:44:11.780 --> 3:44:14.900]  truck bomb not blow the pillars out right in front of the pillars
[3:44:14.900 --> 3:44:17.940]  the same size way back in the back of the building and then why were chunks of
[3:44:17.940 --> 3:44:19.620]  it blown across the street and
[3:44:19.620 --> 3:44:21.500]  why were there blast points on the
[3:44:21.500 --> 3:44:23.060]  on the on the rebar
[3:44:23.060 --> 3:44:24.380]  i mean all of that
[3:44:24.380 --> 3:44:27.740]  you also have the governor coming on obviously wasn't involved because he was
[3:44:27.740 --> 3:44:29.020]  you know we he would
[3:44:29.020 --> 3:44:30.140]  he
[3:44:30.140 --> 3:44:32.740]  or he would have been saying this yeah we found multiple bombs very
[3:44:32.740 --> 3:44:35.100]  sophisticated bombs inside
[3:44:35.100 --> 3:44:39.660]  and the b a t f shows up and says no that's not what you saw
[3:44:39.660 --> 3:44:43.380]  yeah and then you had uh... another bomb expert i mean they've got a bunch of
[3:44:43.380 --> 3:44:46.500]  which have another terrorism and bomb expert that was on one of the local
[3:44:46.500 --> 3:44:49.820]  stations that came in studio just you know a few hours after the bombing it
[3:44:49.820 --> 3:44:50.540]  was
[3:44:50.540 --> 3:44:53.980]  reporting also the other we've just found out that they found other
[3:44:53.980 --> 3:44:57.340]  unexploded bomb that they've taken out of the building and this is really great
[3:44:57.340 --> 3:44:58.420]  because
[3:44:58.420 --> 3:45:02.260]  as they take these apart is going to help us uh... find out who did it and be
[3:45:02.260 --> 3:45:05.540]  able to track them down a little accountable blah blah blah
[3:45:05.540 --> 3:45:08.180]  so you know just all kinds of information like that
[3:45:08.180 --> 3:45:11.220]  i think some of the stuff that jessie try to do the attorney we were talking
[3:45:11.220 --> 3:45:13.460]  about earlier has been a force out
[3:45:13.460 --> 3:45:14.860]  that further
[3:45:14.860 --> 3:45:18.780]  shed light on this case is uh... the information about andry
[3:45:18.780 --> 3:45:22.980]  andrea's or otherwise known as andy strawsmire the west german
[3:45:22.980 --> 3:45:24.820]  that came over to this country and
[3:45:24.820 --> 3:45:28.020]  certainly was here with the knowledge of our government
[3:45:28.020 --> 3:45:31.340]  maybe even officially working for them on some level
[3:45:31.340 --> 3:45:34.220]  but he was certainly knowledgeable about this was
[3:45:34.220 --> 3:45:36.500]  working with mcvay and other people
[3:45:36.500 --> 3:45:40.620]  and uh... some of the documents they've been able to pull out over the last
[3:45:40.620 --> 3:45:42.180]  two or three four years
[3:45:42.180 --> 3:45:43.580]  confirmed that
[3:45:43.580 --> 3:45:47.020]  and uh... we have a southern poverty law center
[3:45:47.020 --> 3:45:50.140]  involved in this is despicable activities but they've got to get our
[3:45:50.140 --> 3:45:51.900]  guns one way or the other
[3:45:51.900 --> 3:45:54.980]  uh... just amazing and then the fact that mcvay
[3:45:54.980 --> 3:45:59.140]  uh... was a government operative coming out of david's it's just incredible
[3:45:59.140 --> 3:46:02.260]  uh... grega new jersey you're on the air go ahead
[3:46:02.260 --> 3:46:05.300]  well thank you very much and uh... thank you uh...
[3:46:05.300 --> 3:46:06.460]  for putting me on
[3:46:06.460 --> 3:46:08.340]  it's kind of ironic here
[3:46:08.340 --> 3:46:12.380]  out in oklahoma they're used to their their state in their their right to be
[3:46:12.380 --> 3:46:16.180]  left alone from the federal government and here in new jersey which is no doubt
[3:46:16.180 --> 3:46:16.980]  are
[3:46:16.980 --> 3:46:19.140]  our representative government in the state
[3:46:19.140 --> 3:46:20.820]  is the criminal syndicate
[3:46:20.820 --> 3:46:23.300]  we actually have the u s attorney
[3:46:23.300 --> 3:46:26.900]  doing the work that new jersey attorney should be doing up a thousand attorneys
[3:46:26.900 --> 3:46:28.940]  working for the state government new jersey
[3:46:28.940 --> 3:46:31.620]  yet they have to use the federal u s attorney
[3:46:31.620 --> 3:46:32.780]  to prosecute
[3:46:32.780 --> 3:46:36.060]  the corrupt politicians that are here so far they've nailed like the mayor of
[3:46:36.060 --> 3:46:39.260]  newark well that's another problem they'll never go after locals with the
[3:46:39.260 --> 3:46:42.260]  state it's like it's supposedly the purview of the feds
[3:46:42.260 --> 3:46:44.780]  who are even more corrupt very dangerous
[3:46:44.780 --> 3:46:48.620]  violation of states rights uh... mister key
[3:46:48.620 --> 3:46:52.860]  yet unfortunate i had somebody on the program of several days ago
[3:46:52.860 --> 3:46:57.180]  uh... call me up and talk about uh... civil rights laws and
[3:46:57.180 --> 3:46:59.580]  how the feds had to come in and prosecute people
[3:46:59.580 --> 3:47:01.580]  poor you know racial
[3:47:01.580 --> 3:47:03.940]  types of the crimes and what have you been
[3:47:03.940 --> 3:47:06.460]  so that's a tough issue you get down the path to you
[3:47:06.460 --> 3:47:08.140]  you know you buy into
[3:47:08.140 --> 3:47:11.540]  the federal government having a good role in the only one that could
[3:47:11.540 --> 3:47:14.100]  fix you know make some wrongs right
[3:47:14.100 --> 3:47:17.900]  and they kind of get things all screwed up well they play that game in europe
[3:47:17.900 --> 3:47:20.620]  where the nation's they want the people ever go to those courts
[3:47:20.620 --> 3:47:22.380]  they've got to go to the u court
[3:47:22.380 --> 3:47:25.700]  and and so it it's it's it's it's handing your authority away when you have
[3:47:25.700 --> 3:47:26.740]  less control
[3:47:26.740 --> 3:47:28.580]  over the feds anything else correct
[3:47:28.580 --> 3:47:31.660]  well i was just that my question was do you think that the good thing or a bad
[3:47:31.660 --> 3:47:35.300]  thing where we have to where we have to actually ask the u.s. attorney to get
[3:47:35.300 --> 3:47:38.580]  involved yeah i think it's a bad thing because the feds are even so much more
[3:47:38.580 --> 3:47:39.740]  corrupt
[3:47:39.740 --> 3:47:42.740]  and they'll only selectively enforce on who they want
[3:47:42.740 --> 3:47:45.700]  uh... i mean i think that really is a state matter
[3:47:45.700 --> 3:47:48.700]  well the problem is always the people not
[3:47:48.700 --> 3:47:51.660]  uh... holding their government accountable that's always the problem
[3:47:51.660 --> 3:47:52.180]  yeah
[3:47:52.180 --> 3:47:55.540]  because you could fix these things at the state level if the people would watch
[3:47:55.540 --> 3:47:59.020]  their government and hold people accountable and make them fix it
[3:47:59.020 --> 3:48:00.180]  yeah here's an example
[3:48:00.180 --> 3:48:03.140]  who do you go to with the feds engaged in terrorism
[3:48:03.140 --> 3:48:06.500]  i mean they admit they stage the u.s.a. celebrity they stage the gulf of
[3:48:06.500 --> 3:48:08.020]  thongan a bunch of other events
[3:48:08.020 --> 3:48:10.860]  who do we go to about our own government staging things i mean
[3:48:10.860 --> 3:48:14.540]  going to the feds you know whoever's got more power almost always going to be
[3:48:14.540 --> 3:48:15.620]  more corrupt
[3:48:15.620 --> 3:48:18.860]  yeah the problem and another way of stating that too is
[3:48:18.860 --> 3:48:22.780]  the problem is is it assumes that somehow the federal government is more
[3:48:22.780 --> 3:48:25.060]  uh... moral or ethical or something
[3:48:25.060 --> 3:48:28.020]  and they're not just like alexis saying you know they're just people and they
[3:48:28.020 --> 3:48:29.540]  are they're corrupt too
[3:48:29.540 --> 3:48:31.740]  and they're going to use their power for
[3:48:31.740 --> 3:48:35.020]  uh... things other than you know what's best for all of us
[3:48:35.020 --> 3:48:38.700]  now let's take another call thanks craig john in fort war texas you're on the
[3:48:38.700 --> 3:48:40.900]  air with the representative key
[3:48:40.900 --> 3:48:44.420]  i think you can take it like all uh... i just want to ask the representative
[3:48:44.420 --> 3:48:45.780]  uh...
[3:48:45.780 --> 3:48:51.060]  how did uh... after oklahoma city how did the uh... in general work
[3:48:51.060 --> 3:48:55.060]  the majority of people in oklahoma were they uh... they go along with the uh...
[3:48:55.060 --> 3:48:56.140]  status
[3:48:56.140 --> 3:48:58.060]  that was given to him or it
[3:48:58.060 --> 3:48:59.700]  was there a lot of uh...
[3:48:59.700 --> 3:49:02.340]  trepidation and what happened
[3:49:02.340 --> 3:49:06.060]  well i think in uh... you know come to describe it this way
[3:49:06.060 --> 3:49:08.300]  uh... and i think always probably will
[3:49:08.300 --> 3:49:10.460]  the answer to that kind of question is that
[3:49:10.460 --> 3:49:12.380]  people were traumatized
[3:49:12.380 --> 3:49:14.980]  you know all over the country but especially right here
[3:49:14.980 --> 3:49:16.140]  at ground
[3:49:16.140 --> 3:49:18.740]  uh... at the ground uh...
[3:49:18.740 --> 3:49:21.500]  central or whatever i'm trying to think of it
[3:49:21.500 --> 3:49:24.580]  at that that right here where it happened right up on the city
[3:49:24.580 --> 3:49:26.140]  i mean people were just
[3:49:26.140 --> 3:49:29.380]  traumatized by this
[3:49:29.380 --> 3:49:32.260]  you know it's hard to find somebody that didn't know someone or had a
[3:49:32.260 --> 3:49:34.860]  relative that was killed
[3:49:34.860 --> 3:49:36.340]  badly hurt
[3:49:36.340 --> 3:49:37.540]  and then
[3:49:37.540 --> 3:49:41.980]  it went on it didn't just go away after that it went on for years
[3:49:41.980 --> 3:49:45.060]  and so people got tired of it they were emotionally
[3:49:45.060 --> 3:49:48.540]  just uh... sick of it wrenched you know
[3:49:48.540 --> 3:49:51.780]  but i mean how do they deal with all those newscasts reporting the bombs and
[3:49:51.780 --> 3:49:55.060]  later newscast saying there were iraqi's involved in all this
[3:49:55.060 --> 3:49:56.180]  i mean i mean
[3:49:56.180 --> 3:50:00.060]  you would i'm when they call you a cook would you raise those points or
[3:50:00.060 --> 3:50:03.740]  yeah i think most people believed it but i think it was an emotional thing is
[3:50:03.740 --> 3:50:06.100]  why they eventually go along
[3:50:06.100 --> 3:50:09.180]  you know they kind of go along with uh...
[3:50:09.180 --> 3:50:12.860]  the entities where there's the newspapers or other politicians
[3:50:12.860 --> 3:50:14.220]  that attack
[3:50:14.220 --> 3:50:15.460]  the messenger
[3:50:15.460 --> 3:50:19.060]  they go along with them because it's an emotional yeah it's too scary it's too
[3:50:19.060 --> 3:50:22.140]  scary to admit the truth uh... thank you uh... john
[3:50:22.140 --> 3:50:27.380]  uh... charles new hampshire final caller for representative charles key
[3:50:27.380 --> 3:50:29.540]  coming up after
[3:50:29.540 --> 3:50:33.220]  this quick break so uh... we've got a final segment
[3:50:33.220 --> 3:50:35.100]  coming up straight ahead
[3:50:35.100 --> 3:50:38.340]  we got a lot of other colors but we'll see how many we get in here

[3:54:46.660 --> 3:54:50.180]  representative tea it's just a wonderful surprise and pleasure to know that
[3:54:50.180 --> 3:54:53.540]  you're back on the hill I'm 47 years of age and
[3:54:53.540 --> 3:54:56.580]  been around you know paying attention to these things for quite some time and I
[3:54:56.580 --> 3:54:59.620]  remember you sticking out back in in the
[3:54:59.620 --> 3:55:03.140]  Oklahoma bombing as being one of the few if not the only
[3:55:03.140 --> 3:55:07.300]  one that was courageous enough to really look into this
[3:55:07.300 --> 3:55:11.780]  thing and I just uh... can't say how happy I am that you that you're back
[3:55:11.780 --> 3:55:16.420]  along with representative Paul my my my inquiry here specifically
[3:55:16.420 --> 3:55:20.660]  because it logically in common sense wise I remember when they
[3:55:20.660 --> 3:55:23.940]  when they were able to find out about the rider truck with supposedly an
[3:55:23.940 --> 3:55:30.100]  unscathed vi n number that just happened happened to miraculously survive this
[3:55:30.100 --> 3:55:33.860]  huge blast in the in the rider truck it reminds me of
[3:55:33.860 --> 3:55:38.020]  nineteen uh... box cutters at nine eleven that somehow got through the
[3:55:38.020 --> 3:55:41.220]  metal detectors and no one has been able to bring out about box cutters at least
[3:55:41.220 --> 3:55:44.580]  than the metal part of the where were the you know it cuts
[3:55:44.580 --> 3:55:48.340]  and what i understand and in some of the pictures that i think i'm still waiting
[3:55:48.340 --> 3:55:52.020]  to see a hole in the ground and what if the Murray building a
[3:55:52.020 --> 3:55:56.180]  nuclear fallout shelter it's it's just certain things common sense
[3:55:56.180 --> 3:56:00.580]  don't add up okay so thanks for the call let me let me get a final comment from
[3:56:00.580 --> 3:56:04.420]  Charles Key on that well i'm you know
[3:56:04.420 --> 3:56:07.540]  there's been a lot of time passed by so i'm not sure i recall
[3:56:07.540 --> 3:56:11.780]  anything like that but it did have uh... some lower levels
[3:56:11.780 --> 3:56:16.340]  in it and it had a lower lower level parking garage that actually was i
[3:56:16.340 --> 3:56:19.940]  think two levels deep below the ground i remember the venn number thing off the
[3:56:19.940 --> 3:56:20.820]  car
[3:56:20.820 --> 3:56:23.940]  yeah the venn number i mean there's a lot of odd things that
[3:56:23.940 --> 3:56:27.220]  happened in the Oklahoma City case and that may be some real good you know
[3:56:27.220 --> 3:56:30.820]  evidence but i'll end up that that's not worthy of talking about it when i say
[3:56:30.820 --> 3:56:32.900]  make my next comment but the fact is
[3:56:32.900 --> 3:56:36.020]  you know there's there's a wealth of information
[3:56:36.020 --> 3:56:39.060]  that proves that there were other people involved
[3:56:39.060 --> 3:56:42.740]  that our justice department if we had did not want to go after those people
[3:56:42.740 --> 3:56:46.580]  intentionally did not and you know to close up with the back to the tenth
