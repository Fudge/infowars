[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he

[00:30.480 --> 00:36.200]  private corporate world government waging financial war against the
[00:36.200 --> 00:43.800]  individual and the nation state a tsunami of 1.5 quadrillion fiat
[00:43.800 --> 00:50.400]  dollars flooding the world the weaponized banking system consolidating
[00:50.400 --> 00:55.000]  power at an accelerated pace we have congressman former congressman Bob
[00:55.000 --> 01:01.560]  barb joining us to cover the TSA and that ongoing journey towards tyranny as
[01:01.560 --> 01:07.880]  the system tries to break our will and set the precedent to have federal goons
[01:07.880 --> 01:13.080]  on the streets of America not just the airports he'll be joining us coming up
[01:13.080 --> 01:16.960]  in about 30 minutes and then I haven't interviewed her in years because she's
[01:16.960 --> 01:23.320]  pretty much retired but Charlotte, Israel former head of policy at the
[01:23.320 --> 01:28.280]  Department of Education under Reagan discovered that it really was a plan by
[01:28.280 --> 01:32.080]  the bureaucracy to dumb down the American people and she's going to be
[01:32.080 --> 01:37.560]  joining us coming up today for a rare interview with Charlotte, Israel so
[01:37.560 --> 01:42.400]  that's something that folks do not want to miss and we'll have wide open phones
[01:42.400 --> 01:47.680]  also in the third hour today we'll also take some phone calls on education or
[01:47.680 --> 01:53.480]  the program to dumb the population down with Charlotte, Israel be crass
[01:53.480 --> 01:58.840]  commercial plug here as G Gordon Liddy would say crass commercial messages
[01:58.840 --> 02:04.120]  straight ahead I've been able to get a hold over and over a year and a half so
[02:04.120 --> 02:07.400]  we stopped carrying her book deliberate dumbing down I noticed it was selling for
[02:07.400 --> 02:15.680]  like $80 a hundred dollars on eBay and Amazon in many places and I noticed we
[02:15.680 --> 02:20.160]  had an email from her saying well I'm my books out of print I've got you know
[02:20.160 --> 02:25.760]  500 or so left whoever wants them buy them so I called up last week and bought
[02:25.760 --> 02:29.560]  every stink in one of them and said hey do you want to come back on the show it's
[02:29.560 --> 02:32.840]  been probably two years since you've been on a year and a half or so and she
[02:32.840 --> 02:37.520]  said yeah but you know I'm retired and she'd had some deaths in the family so
[02:37.520 --> 02:41.200]  she took off some time and she said she's leaving the US again for a few
[02:41.200 --> 02:44.560]  months coming up here very soon and she said if you want all the books they're
[02:44.560 --> 02:50.520]  yours these are the size of basically the Austin phone book and it chronicles
[02:50.520 --> 02:55.960]  the entire dumbing down process with the government's own documents and this is
[02:55.960 --> 03:01.560]  such an important tool for people who are in education or for parents who are
[03:01.560 --> 03:05.880]  concerned everybody who's a school board member needs to have this to bring this
[03:05.880 --> 03:10.440]  book up in your school board meetings so people really understand there's a
[03:10.440 --> 03:14.360]  reason we've gone from number one in the world 50 plus years ago to being

[07:00.000 --> 07:03.360]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[07:03.360 --> 07:07.640]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[07:07.640 --> 07:11.800]  your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[07:11.800 --> 07:15.880]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[07:15.880 --> 07:20.240]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[07:20.240 --> 07:24.320]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[07:24.320 --> 07:28.880]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:28.880 --> 07:33.000]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:33.000 --> 07:37.000]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.760]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:40.760 --> 07:43.480]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[07:43.480 --> 07:48.720]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolar
[07:48.720 --> 07:53.200]  backup com that's my solar backup com remember the government doesn't own the

[08:00.280 --> 08:08.800]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:08.800 --> 08:34.320]  we're live ladies and gentlemen it is Monday the sixth day of December 2010
[08:34.320 --> 08:39.640]  and we're going to be live here for the next three hours former congressman Bob
[08:39.640 --> 08:44.080]  Barr is going to be joining us coming up later in the hour to talk about the TSA
[08:44.080 --> 08:48.040]  and the Freedom of Information Act request he's put in dealing with the
[08:48.040 --> 08:55.200]  TSA reportedly circulating memos about persecuting people that criticize the
[08:55.200 --> 09:00.840]  TSA all part of this reign of terror with the new minimum wage federal brown
[09:00.840 --> 09:10.920]  shirt legions that work for the Homeland Security Gestapo or NKVD but I wrote
[09:10.920 --> 09:17.840]  some notes last night before I get into all this news you know sometimes just
[09:17.840 --> 09:24.320]  the urgency really hits me and last night I couldn't even sleep I was so
[09:24.320 --> 09:30.800]  focused on what's happening in our society and just how real and palpable and
[09:30.800 --> 09:39.680]  absurdist I mean it's so real it's so off the charts that it is absurd how much
[09:39.680 --> 09:43.800]  tyranny we're putting up with the federal government comes out last week
[09:43.800 --> 09:47.360]  and openly admits that they are spying on basically all the credit card
[09:47.360 --> 09:54.120]  transactions and store loyalty card transactions in real time there's face
[09:54.120 --> 09:58.800]  scanning cameras license plate reading cameras up all over the country and
[09:58.800 --> 10:07.160]  going up worldwide domestic spy forces in regard 50 plus thousand clergy
[10:07.160 --> 10:10.920]  recruited by Homeland Security to spy on their flocks and to give them
[10:10.920 --> 10:15.440]  sermons about submitting the tyranny we have the actual training manuals five
[10:15.440 --> 10:20.640]  years ago on this years later it was partially declassified I mean it's so
[10:20.640 --> 10:26.960]  creepy and the torture camps and the secret torture camps and how it
[10:26.960 --> 10:31.960]  continues no matter who is in office and over and over again the Al Qaeda
[10:31.960 --> 10:37.280]  leadership caught working with the US government and caught being at the
[10:37.280 --> 10:43.400]  Pentagon and military bases I mean it's just insane and over and over again
[10:43.400 --> 10:47.440]  every week or two it comes out that the government knowingly authorized this
[10:47.440 --> 10:52.280]  chemical in the plastics or this chemical in the water and that they want to
[10:52.280 --> 10:57.480]  sterilizes they want to give us cancer it's really simple you got a bunch of
[10:57.480 --> 11:04.560]  control freak sadist who under National Security Act of 47 brought in hundreds
[11:04.560 --> 11:08.680]  of thousands of Nazis and their supporters because they would follow
[11:08.680 --> 11:13.640]  orders they found lots of other Americans that would follow orders to set up
[11:13.640 --> 11:19.000]  this eugenics operation and Adolf Hitler and everything he did was
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.600]  publicly funded by the Rockefellers and the Carnegie's and the Mr. Watson of
[11:24.600 --> 11:30.800]  IBM and now all those same families finance the eugenics and the Planned
[11:30.800 --> 11:36.040]  Parenthood and the sterilization and the forced vaccines and the fluoride in the
[11:36.040 --> 11:40.760]  water and we've got all the Rockefeller documents in the 60s 70s 80s 90s I've
[11:40.760 --> 11:45.000]  shown you here on air we've linked to them they're public about how they've
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.240]  come out with vaccines that have sterilants in them and how it only
[11:49.240 --> 11:54.480]  sterilizes a certain percentage so you don't notice I mean it's so diabolical
[11:54.480 --> 11:59.200]  and it's out in the open and I've got to just sit here every day and calmly
[11:59.200 --> 12:04.680]  cover this and I feel like a radio show isn't even the format you know having
[12:04.680 --> 12:11.840]  ads having guest having to have guest on who aren't as informed and just the
[12:11.840 --> 12:17.320]  child lightness and the ignorance of the public and in the open evil just
[12:17.320 --> 12:26.400]  running rampant everywhere and then I don't feel like I'm the person to be
[12:26.400 --> 12:35.160]  able to even bring you this information it's so horrific and so off the charts and
[12:35.160 --> 12:38.760]  then just everybody goes about their business with sports and having fun and
[12:38.760 --> 12:42.440]  going to the movies and I don't blame them in fact during the Great Depression
[12:42.440 --> 12:46.320]  people got even more distracted and more into entertainment and more into
[12:46.320 --> 12:53.120]  escapism but this is something that you can't escape by living in denial and I
[12:53.120 --> 12:56.960]  understand and I know many of you understand that there's this high-tech
[12:56.960 --> 13:03.120]  facade that we all take part in and add to in this engineered society where our
[13:03.120 --> 13:07.960]  paradigms are basically written into the culture and we're put in front of the
[13:07.960 --> 13:12.200]  television in our diapers to just be conditioned to live in this false
[13:12.200 --> 13:20.840]  reality and then right beneath the surface the membrane between this false
[13:20.840 --> 13:27.680]  reality the false paradigm and the real reality is paper thin it's Bible paper
[13:27.680 --> 13:35.600]  thin you can see through it and right there is the leering mechanized evil
[13:35.600 --> 13:40.120]  you know the globalists don't care about a million-plus Iraqis that lands it
[13:40.120 --> 13:43.920]  years ago reported you know six years in the war it was a million-plus dead
[13:43.920 --> 13:53.160]  hundreds of thousands of dead Afghans do you think they care about you I mean
[13:53.160 --> 13:56.960]  when you watch a football game when you watch the news when you listen to talk
[13:56.960 --> 14:02.640]  radio when you read the newspaper it's like living in an absurdist cartoon
[14:02.640 --> 14:08.800]  1984 every time there's a basketball three-pointer they cut to five troops at
[14:08.800 --> 14:14.680]  the basketball game to create a Pavlovian response to associate a victory with
[14:14.680 --> 14:21.760]  the troops and to build them up in false status like they are the kings they
[14:21.760 --> 14:27.120]  are the best they are the heroes but that's only so that false mantle of
[14:27.120 --> 14:33.840]  heroic dynamism can be added to the state as if the state represents our
[14:33.840 --> 14:38.040]  young warriors they understand our base instincts to love our young warriors but
[14:38.040 --> 14:41.760]  they're not our warriors they work for the globalist oh they've got a false
[14:41.760 --> 14:48.000]  paradigm a false downloaded hypnotic suggestion compulsive hypnotic you know
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.360]  but brainwashing template put into them since birth that that that you know land
[14:53.360 --> 15:00.480]  of the free home of the brave John Wayne but that's not what it is those troops
[15:00.480 --> 15:06.000]  are hated homeland security hates their guts homeland security knows that like a
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.640]  piece of military equipment or a or a howitzer cannon they have to be spiked
[15:10.640 --> 15:15.480]  after they get out of the military so they're injected and used as guinea pigs
[15:15.480 --> 15:20.920]  and nerve-gassed and they use uranium weapons and they're filled with all the
[15:20.920 --> 15:24.560]  vaccines and they're now having the announcements that their pension funds
[15:24.560 --> 15:27.360]  are going to be taken that they were promised and they got to get their own
[15:27.360 --> 15:35.640]  health care and they the VA hospitals are just rat-infested warrens but all
[15:35.640 --> 15:39.080]  the supposed troops supporters they never want to hear about that they want
[15:39.080 --> 15:44.840]  the shallow oh I love the troops I fly an American flag out front my house when
[15:44.840 --> 15:49.800]  America was dead and gone a long time ago overrun and taken over by the
[15:49.800 --> 15:53.720]  corporate board using us as the engine for their world government and if you
[15:53.720 --> 15:58.160]  want to save this country because it's it's been heads above any other nation
[15:58.160 --> 16:02.280]  with its basic liberties though those liberties were never really fully
[16:02.280 --> 16:08.280]  realized it was the greatest idea that that that that Jeffersonian idea if you
[16:08.280 --> 16:12.840]  I know that's a lot better than what the globalist are offering ancient tyranny
[16:12.840 --> 16:20.720]  amalgamated with high-tech systems of control I know we're dealing with
[16:20.720 --> 16:25.680]  psychopaths I know we're dealing with sadist I know homeland security is
[16:25.680 --> 16:31.600]  running around taking over the media and trying to censor people I know the
[16:31.600 --> 16:35.280]  world government's real because it's out in the open I've got the basic
[16:35.280 --> 16:45.240]  survival instinct not the courage no no no not courage self-preservation sure I
[16:45.240 --> 16:49.040]  could go along with this I could have played ball with the system I could get
[16:49.040 --> 16:53.080]  some little petty power position in this thing a long time ago I passed the
[16:53.080 --> 16:58.400]  point of return over a decade ago but in the end I would be destroying my
[16:58.400 --> 17:05.480]  self and my family and my species the only thing you can do is get educated on
[17:05.480 --> 17:11.920]  these issues get informed on these issues and get involved exposing
[17:11.920 --> 17:19.760]  corruption and believe me it's everywhere the system has made the decision to go
[17:19.760 --> 17:32.480]  for broke the system is now pulling out all the stops and so they don't care if
[17:32.480 --> 17:36.520]  you know that they're getting ready and openly announcing that they're gonna not
[17:36.520 --> 17:40.080]  just free Social Security but start cutting it what do you think the
[17:40.080 --> 17:45.360]  inflation is that's a cut right there that they are going after the group that
[17:45.360 --> 17:47.800]  if they can get away with it with that group they can get away with any group
[17:47.800 --> 17:51.840]  and that is telling troops get your own insurance after you're out of the
[17:51.840 --> 17:55.480]  military we're not going to give you health care even though you sign the
[17:55.480 --> 18:01.360]  contract and we're promised it I mean if they can get away with that they can
[18:01.360 --> 18:05.800]  do anything ladies and gentlemen the globalist compete with each other over
[18:05.800 --> 18:09.360]  who can be the most cunning the most ruthless the most abusive the most
[18:09.360 --> 18:16.400]  bloodthirsty they enjoy the power they enjoy the secret police they enjoy the
[18:16.400 --> 18:21.960]  secret arrest they enjoy the snatch and grab teams they enjoy the psychopathic
[18:21.960 --> 18:28.280]  power they are turning our paradigm from a liberty-based paradigm where you
[18:28.280 --> 18:32.240]  might not always get liberty and freedom but at least that's honored to a
[18:32.240 --> 18:37.520]  system where our heroes on scores of TV shows like 24 are torturing

[19:04.040 --> 19:08.880]  power above them are the corporate puppet masters who are setting up a
[19:08.880 --> 19:12.800]  corporate tyranny who do have a policy of scorched earth to dumb down our
[19:12.800 --> 19:19.640]  population to destroy the engines of individual liberty and socials cohesive
[19:19.640 --> 19:27.480]  strength it is a scorched earth ruthless policy and in your gut you know I'm

[19:42.400 --> 19:45.920]  have fear of the new world order is because I'm not worried about my
[19:45.920 --> 19:50.960]  shelf individually my only fear is that they are successful in what they're
[19:50.960 --> 19:57.040]  doing Hitler was only one bad son you know that's like a tree baby tree they

[24:36.440 --> 24:41.920]  the success everybody has to lick their boots and they always create the same
[24:41.920 --> 24:50.440]  type of society it's a giant grid so they get to bully and control people it's
[24:50.440 --> 24:55.480]  so cartoonish to watch an NFL football game where the whole thing is about
[24:55.480 --> 25:00.240]  worshiping wars and worshiping the military when we don't even run our
[25:00.240 --> 25:04.000]  country anymore we're fitting the bill for this private world government and
[25:04.000 --> 25:08.320]  they hold up those troops up there and talk about how much they care about them
[25:08.320 --> 25:12.280]  when they hate their stinking guts and the entire apparatus of government is
[25:12.280 --> 25:17.840]  pointed at the veterans and that's on record and I'll be on neocon talk shows
[25:17.840 --> 25:22.520]  and I'll bring this up to them and it's like they don't hear me or I'll bring up
[25:22.520 --> 25:26.480]  you know Alcada was created by our own government you know it's protected you
[25:26.480 --> 25:29.360]  know it's admitted and we're on the lock he supposedly the number one under
[25:29.360 --> 25:34.720]  bin Laden and he's being protected and he's hanging out at the Pentagon
[25:34.720 --> 25:39.520]  secretly Fox News and the and the those hosts don't attack me they don't even
[25:39.520 --> 25:44.240]  respond they move on to something else they don't want to see it don't you get
[25:44.240 --> 25:49.600]  it we've got a criminal cartel running our country and beginning to take over
[25:49.600 --> 25:56.160]  the world and the UN was their own Pentagon creation and they openly say
[25:56.160 --> 25:59.520]  once the world government's in place there's nowhere to run you know if one
[25:59.520 --> 26:04.720]  state of 50 is oppressive or has higher taxes people just run to the next
[26:04.720 --> 26:09.320]  it's the same thing globally if one nation has lower taxes and more freedom
[26:09.320 --> 26:13.120]  you're gonna move there so they want global standards global government
[26:13.120 --> 26:18.100]  continuity of agenda so you don't have a choice so you have nowhere to run and I
[26:18.100 --> 26:26.920]  know most of you understand this better than I do but I think about the Stasi I
[26:26.920 --> 26:33.080]  think about what went on in East Germany until 1989 and then I look at what
[26:33.080 --> 26:38.880]  our country's become and the actual spine grid makes the Stasi the greatest
[26:38.880 --> 26:44.040]  surveillance state ever look tame in comparison
[26:46.920 --> 26:53.220]  I mean we know this government's out of control and and and they know what the
[26:53.220 --> 26:56.840]  TSA is about a big power grab to take over the states to take over
[26:56.840 --> 27:01.920]  transportation to stick their hands down your pants to create no travel no fly
[27:01.920 --> 27:07.320]  no gun buy no get credit list they've announced all that were to do anything
[27:07.320 --> 27:11.040]  you've got to be on the government list authorizing it I mean that's worse than
[27:11.040 --> 27:18.960]  East Germany it's stinkin travel permits right out of East Germany and people
[27:18.960 --> 27:25.200]  don't value freedom because they just take it for granted the American people
[27:25.200 --> 27:31.680]  are in a trance they're in a daze literally they and what's even worse is
[27:31.680 --> 27:41.200]  they smile with that brainwash slave mesmerized grin of like basically it's
[27:41.200 --> 27:47.640]  it's the grin of like a bad child and laugh at those of us that care like we're
[27:47.640 --> 27:52.760]  weak for caring they think because they don't care and they're not involved that
[27:52.760 --> 28:01.840]  that's a strength ignorance a strength that was one of the mottos in 1984 Eric
[28:01.840 --> 28:07.880]  Blair George Arwell he'd work for British intelligence he'd work for the
[28:07.880 --> 28:11.920]  communists he'd work for the Imperial police and he wrote a book saying it's
[28:11.920 --> 28:15.920]  all controlled both sides staged wars the government was staging terror attacks
[28:15.920 --> 28:19.640]  in the book 1948 it was written black helicopters are looking through your
[28:19.640 --> 28:24.360]  walls your television sets watch you and now all the major video game makers have
[28:24.360 --> 28:33.120]  come out with face scanning video games like connect they've come out with face
[28:33.120 --> 28:38.120]  scanning video games with cameras that recognize your face and up to ten people's
[28:38.120 --> 28:42.040]  different voices in the room Tivo admits they're tracking what you watch
[28:42.040 --> 28:45.640]  Google admits they're using the onboard cameras and microphones to watch you
[28:45.640 --> 28:50.960]  public schools all over the country come out and say yeah we're using cameras on
[28:50.960 --> 29:02.960]  laptops to watch you at home I mean it's just all out in the open now this is
[29:02.960 --> 29:10.440]  1984 and and there's still wealth because there was liberty here so so I'm
[29:10.440 --> 29:14.680]  watching the wealth drain out like watching a person bleed to death watching
[29:14.680 --> 29:20.000]  their skin go from pink to ash and white or if they were black watching their
[29:20.000 --> 29:25.440]  skin go from chestnut to almost a green color I'm watching the blood just pour
[29:25.440 --> 29:30.040]  out of the body politic I'm watching the big central banks just drinking it up
[29:30.040 --> 29:35.480]  like a bunch of vampire bats little stunted devils enjoying themselves
[29:35.480 --> 29:41.760]  laughing at us I watched those being fed on drugged out of their minds on

[34:01.840 --> 34:07.880]  an unfair trade advantage you know these are the real forms of discrimination
[34:07.880 --> 34:14.960]  that are taking place in our society and then in the name of not having
[34:14.960 --> 34:19.160]  discrimination they say everyone will have the TSA body scan you everyone

[34:59.280 --> 35:03.520]  on spying into U.S. citizens so we've gone from four years ago Bush in that
[35:03.520 --> 35:06.840]  press conference president Bush saying oh we don't spy on you without warrants
[35:06.840 --> 35:13.400]  to just hey everything's spied on well there's an organization out there

[35:57.960 --> 36:02.320]  the town I live in has federally run face-scanning cameras and license plate
[36:02.320 --> 36:05.960]  readers through the threat fusion center they have clergy response teams
[36:05.960 --> 36:10.240]  admittedly with preachers trained to spy for Homeland Security that's
[36:10.240 --> 36:14.600]  associated press we have TSA sticking their hands down people's pants and
[36:14.600 --> 36:19.480]  radiating them but the borders are basically wide open I'm glad you formed
[36:19.480 --> 36:22.840]  Liberty Guard and for years have been speaking out against this but man you know
[36:22.840 --> 36:26.800]  folks were like all bob bars kind of little too concerned 10 years ago now
[36:26.800 --> 36:32.720]  people are saying my god I mean are we gonna be worse than 1984 I tell you the
[36:32.720 --> 36:38.320]  the technology that is available nowadays that governments and businesses can use
[36:38.320 --> 36:44.440]  to invade privacy and to data mine goes far beyond anything that your door well
[36:44.440 --> 36:50.040]  could have could have envisioned so in some respects certainly we're not we're
[36:50.040 --> 36:55.640]  not at the point of the totalitarian brutality state that was depicted in
[36:55.640 --> 37:01.080]  1984 but in terms of the technology that is available to government to invade
[37:01.080 --> 37:07.200]  people's privacy and to control them by taking away their privacy far exceeds
[37:07.200 --> 37:13.240]  what was what was available or could be even contemplated back in the 1940s when
[37:13.240 --> 37:18.320]  1984 was right was right absolutely well I mean take the TSA I want to see if you
[37:18.320 --> 37:21.480]  concur with me and then I want you to have some time and go over your view on
[37:21.480 --> 37:25.680]  and what Liberty Guard is doing but they I mean I saw Ridge seven years ago when
[37:25.680 --> 37:29.200]  he was head of Homeland Security on C-SPAN in a two-hour roundtable with
[37:29.200 --> 37:33.560]  corporate heads he said you'll have to have an ID card to have a job that's the
[37:33.560 --> 37:37.800]  real ID he said that it will be internal checkpoints and now they're out there
[37:37.800 --> 37:41.320]  with the TSA running checkpoints on highways bus terminals as you know
[37:41.320 --> 37:47.200]  congressman and now they're saying a no fly no buy if they say you can't fly you
[37:47.200 --> 37:51.880]  can't buy a gun no judge no jury you're put on this Kafka-esque list I mean is
[37:51.880 --> 37:56.600]  this not internal checkpoints what give us your take on that and and and just the
[37:56.600 --> 38:01.840]  overall spectrum of what's happening with the TSA but what what's happened here
[38:01.840 --> 38:07.120]  Alex is we've had a sort of a perfect storm we've seen and you've seen of
[38:07.120 --> 38:12.080]  course because you've spoken out about it for many years the growth in government
[38:12.080 --> 38:17.960]  power on virtually all fronts but it accelerated greatly as a result of what
[38:17.960 --> 38:27.520]  happened on September 11th of 2000 2001 and it is that abject fear that has
[38:27.520 --> 38:35.320]  both empowered government to greatly accelerate the the steps to to control
[38:35.320 --> 38:39.640]  people take away their privacy to gain information to control them in various
[38:39.640 --> 38:45.520]  ways and it's that same fear that has made so many Americans virtual sheep in
[38:45.520 --> 38:52.000]  terms of saying well if it makes us safer it's okay we have to give up some of our
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.560]  freedom in order for government to make us secure I mean that is a toxic mixture
[38:57.560 --> 39:03.920]  that has given rise now to the scenario that you've just described which for
[39:03.920 --> 39:10.400]  example just focusing on one very small part of it and that is the TSA naked
[39:10.400 --> 39:19.920]  body scanners or you know the the very intrusive hand searches clearly these are
[39:19.920 --> 39:26.040]  unconstitutional because they are doing this to people as to whom they have no
[39:26.040 --> 39:30.800]  reasonable suspicion whatsoever that they have done anything wrong or are
[39:30.800 --> 39:35.480]  purporting or attempting for example to bring weapons or explosives on an
[39:35.480 --> 39:41.280]  airplane also I think it's important for people to keep in mind as I know your
[39:41.280 --> 39:49.240]  listeners do that the freedom to travel the right to travel in interstate
[39:49.240 --> 39:56.120]  commerce that is to take a commercial airliner from point A to point B has
[39:56.120 --> 40:01.160]  been found many years ago by the US Supreme Court to be a fundamental
[40:01.160 --> 40:07.880]  index of freedom of liberty now are we going to get to the point where the
[40:07.880 --> 40:13.800]  Supreme Court will put a stop to this nonsense I don't know justice Alito on
[40:13.800 --> 40:19.080]  the US Supreme Court for example in an opinion a few years ago seemed to
[40:19.080 --> 40:26.040]  indicate that without some suspicion that an air traveler is doing some
[40:26.040 --> 40:30.880]  thing wrong or that TSA can articulate a reason why they need to search this
[40:30.880 --> 40:37.160]  particular person beyond the normal screening process is unconstitutional
[40:37.160 --> 40:40.960]  whether or not a man whether or not he still believes that whether or not a
[40:40.960 --> 40:47.200]  majority of the court will will so render a decision I don't know and even
[40:47.200 --> 40:52.200]  though I'm not terribly hopeful that that will happen it's it's terribly
[40:52.200 --> 40:57.040]  important that we finally get some resolution of this to get this teed up
[40:57.040 --> 41:01.880]  so that it can get through the courts well absolutely congressman but on top
[41:01.880 --> 41:08.160]  of that we've seen in the last few weeks cases where they want to x-ray a
[41:08.160 --> 41:12.000]  woman's breast milk or they want another woman to dump her milk out and they
[41:12.000 --> 41:17.520]  hold up the TSA's own own own rule book which is just regulations but but their
[41:17.520 --> 41:22.040]  own rules and they don't care because so many of these people it seems in
[41:22.040 --> 41:26.080]  joy the exercise of power some are polite but I've seen others that
[41:26.080 --> 41:31.400]  literally treat people worse than you know jail guards treat prisoners it's
[41:31.400 --> 41:36.920]  just incredible and also they're supposed to take a medical ID card when
[41:36.920 --> 41:41.440]  they're clearly wanting someone's knee and it's a metal knee or a metal hip I've
[41:41.440 --> 41:44.800]  talked to governor Ventura about this they all know who he is I've seen him
[41:44.800 --> 41:50.080]  asked for for autographs but then they grab his crotch I've flown with him
[41:50.080 --> 41:53.720]  right in front of him Ron Paul was on two weeks ago he said yes they grab his
[41:53.720 --> 41:58.840]  crotch I have sat there and watched nothing but women and children being
[41:58.840 --> 42:03.560]  searched when I was in San Jose so they also randomly only search certain
[42:03.560 --> 42:12.400]  groups I mean this is a complete journey towards submission to these untrained
[42:12.400 --> 42:18.560]  in many respects federal federal goons congressman I mean this is as you said
[42:18.560 --> 42:24.120]  so Orwellian what about the fact that they're not even following their own
[42:24.120 --> 42:31.960]  procedures they don't often follow their own procedures for example when we
[42:31.960 --> 42:38.560]  created the opt-out alliance back shortly before Thanksgiving and we did
[42:38.560 --> 42:43.520]  up but we wanted to do a air traveler rights cards which we have available
[42:43.520 --> 42:48.920]  people go to opt-out alliance we put on the back of that car does some of the
[42:48.920 --> 42:55.200]  rights that people have and even though you can find these you really have to
[42:55.200 --> 43:01.320]  dig for them through the regulations and the manuals and so forth the TSA and
[43:01.320 --> 43:06.440]  DHS have available because they don't like to let people know for example that
[43:06.440 --> 43:12.240]  if you are going to have one of the hand searches done you do have a right to
[43:12.240 --> 43:17.480]  have it done properly you do have a right to have somebody present with you but
[43:17.480 --> 43:23.960]  they don't like to advertise that with regard to those things that they do that
[43:23.960 --> 43:30.160]  that are contrary to or are not authorized in their in their statute
[43:30.160 --> 43:36.360]  or in their statute or in the regulations they rely primarily simply on
[43:36.360 --> 43:40.720]  telling people and people acquiescing because they don't know any better or
[43:40.720 --> 43:44.520]  they think the government is telling him the truth
[43:44.520 --> 43:51.400]  congressman specifically dealing with the TSA I mean just in your gut where do
[43:51.400 --> 43:56.080]  you see this fight going the the pilots are allowed to fly this you know giant
[43:56.080 --> 44:01.120]  hundred and something thousand pound 747 missile and they said you want to grab
[44:01.120 --> 44:04.720]  my genitals now all they've got to do is show their ID to make sure they are the
[44:04.720 --> 44:09.840]  pilot totally reasonable now the unions for the flight attendants are saying no
[44:09.840 --> 44:14.880]  and the TSA is backing off on them now they're talking about not groping small
[44:14.880 --> 44:20.120]  children as intensely lawsuits have been filed at courthouses in multiple states
[44:20.120 --> 44:25.440]  like Colorado they've stopped naked body scanning below 18-year-old because it
[44:25.440 --> 44:30.520]  violates the child porn laws where do you see this fight going in your gut do
[44:30.520 --> 44:34.680]  you agree with me that this is something actually that's gone too far people
[44:34.680 --> 44:38.600]  being sexually violated and that no matter what the TSA does or how much
[44:38.600 --> 44:42.320]  propaganda they put out or how much intimidation that if you don't do it
[44:42.320 --> 44:47.200]  we'll give you a $11,000 fines or we'll put you on a no-fly list I mean do you
[44:47.200 --> 44:53.200]  see them losing this if they they they will lose it the American people will
[44:53.200 --> 44:57.600]  prevail but it's going to take a lot of hard work over an extended period of
[44:57.600 --> 45:02.840]  time Alex it's not going to be successful that is the fight for freedom
[45:02.840 --> 45:09.120]  and to rein in this this this intrusive overbearing and unnecessary
[45:09.120 --> 45:14.000]  unconstitutional government behavior it's going to take more than simply a
[45:14.000 --> 45:18.520]  few people protesting up for a day or on a particular day and then hoping that
[45:18.520 --> 45:24.720]  because for example if TSA tries to neutralize a protest by you know
[45:24.720 --> 45:30.800]  simply not turning on or turning off the the full-body scanners that the
[45:30.800 --> 45:35.920]  problem goes away people are sadly mistaken so on the one hand there is
[45:35.920 --> 45:41.440]  cause for a very slight degree of optimism and let me explain that first
[45:41.440 --> 45:47.360]  of all you mentioned the real ID the real ID was supposed to have been
[45:47.360 --> 45:52.040]  implemented several years ago but has not yet been implemented and may never
[45:52.040 --> 45:57.200]  be implemented because the American people in state governments objected to
[45:57.200 --> 46:01.320]  it and objected to it well you thought that I mean you led the charge against
[46:01.320 --> 46:06.640]  it absolutely and you know that's what that's one of those rare victories that
[46:06.640 --> 46:10.600]  we've had now you can never let up in the fight against government oppression
[46:10.600 --> 46:15.680]  never ever let up so you know it's a constant battle to make sure that the
[46:15.680 --> 46:20.000]  real ID doesn't doesn't surface as something else they'll give it a new
[46:20.000 --> 46:23.760]  acronym and so forth that they'll fund it partially somewhere and then come back
[46:23.760 --> 46:29.960]  to it again later but at least for now that's been a very significant success
[46:29.960 --> 46:35.720]  in fighting government and intrusion and unconstitutional behavior secondly
[46:35.720 --> 46:39.960]  even though these are small victories that you just indicated with regard to
[46:39.960 --> 46:48.000]  airline pilots and some loosening of the the intrusive searches and the x-rays
[46:48.000 --> 46:54.000]  on certain types of persons children under and minors and so forth it's gonna
[46:54.000 --> 46:59.160]  take a lot more I mean as long as the government is able to have people subject
[46:59.160 --> 47:05.320]  themselves to a naked body scanner with the only alternative being a you know
[47:05.320 --> 47:13.600]  grossly invasive manual search without articulating any suspicion that the
[47:13.600 --> 47:16.840]  person that they're searching either electronically or manually has done
[47:16.840 --> 47:21.000]  anything wrong as long as people are willing to put up with that it's going
[47:21.000 --> 47:27.120]  to embolden government to continue to press the envelope I'm also hopeful that
[47:27.120 --> 47:34.720]  the court challenges will will be successful I'm also hopeful that some of
[47:34.720 --> 47:40.960]  the new chairman coming into Congress for example John Micah of Florida who is
[47:40.960 --> 47:45.640]  the who is likely to be the Transportation Committee chair in the
[47:45.640 --> 47:52.880]  House with responsibility over air travel and Darrell Issa of California who
[47:52.880 --> 47:57.600]  is likely to take over as chair of the government oversight reform committee
[47:57.600 --> 48:04.720]  that both of these chairs on the House side will very shortly after taking over
[48:04.720 --> 48:09.720]  their positions which seems likely as chairman of these two key committees will
[48:09.720 --> 48:17.600]  hold some some real tough and consistent long-term oversight hearings on TSA and
[48:17.600 --> 48:20.920]  what they're doing all right congressman a bunch of quick questions in the 12
[48:20.920 --> 48:26.720]  minutes we've got left with you specifically dealing with some of your
[48:26.720 --> 48:32.040]  four-year request that you've put out Bob Barr investigates TSA stand down on
[48:32.040 --> 48:36.240]  national opt-out day I mean if they're saying that this terror threat was so
[48:36.240 --> 48:40.320]  imminent they had to stick their hands down people's pants and put put nuns and
[48:40.320 --> 48:43.560]  little old ladies and naked body scanners which they've been caught
[48:43.560 --> 48:48.360]  saving by the way folks the just continual deception then isn't that
[48:48.360 --> 48:54.560]  then some type of stand down or dereliction of duty or or fraud if as
[48:54.560 --> 48:57.640]  we've now confirmed even mainstream news is confirmed but I had employees that
[48:57.640 --> 49:01.880]  flew that day in multiple airports that they did completely stand down the
[49:01.880 --> 49:05.520]  scanners at most airports they didn't do the pat downs they were just running
[49:05.520 --> 49:09.640]  people through them at some of the other airports they just curtailed it and
[49:09.640 --> 49:15.800]  then ran this hoax saying oh it was TSA appreciation day no one opted out I mean
[49:15.800 --> 49:19.320]  that looks like that could be criminal right there I mean shouldn't we have
[49:19.320 --> 49:24.360]  some type of congressional investigation about the stand down a and then B watch
[49:24.360 --> 49:30.840]  dog probes DHS spying on drudge prisonplanet.com Matt drudge Alex Jones of
[49:30.840 --> 49:35.000]  the drudge report of course has been carrying that so I talk about a the
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.040]  stand down and be your foyer dealing with persecution because even CNN has
[49:39.040 --> 49:42.440]  reported that they believe their reporters and others have been put on the
[49:42.440 --> 49:48.360]  list after running reports critical it it's a it's a real problem that we've
[49:48.360 --> 49:52.400]  gotten to the point in this country where if you simply question what the
[49:52.400 --> 49:57.160]  government is doing you're going to find yourself on the wrong end of that
[49:57.160 --> 50:02.640]  government power we see it in a number of areas Alex we see it when citizens
[50:02.640 --> 50:09.040]  simply use a a camera video or a handheld video to record what police are
[50:09.040 --> 50:14.320]  doing in the public arena where they appear to be you know beating up
[50:14.320 --> 50:18.240]  somebody or taking action that they shouldn't and having them the police
[50:18.240 --> 50:22.840]  come after the people that are video taping recording what is being done
[50:22.840 --> 50:27.400]  what is being done in the open yeah there's no perception I mean I mean you
[50:27.400 --> 50:30.960]  know as a congressman and lawyer and everything else there's no perception of
[50:30.960 --> 50:35.360]  privacy so why do the cops march over 200 yards and then beat you up in a
[50:35.360 --> 50:40.560]  rescue for video taping them it's a it's a problem we see the same thing with
[50:40.560 --> 50:45.480]  regard to some of the folks that have had you know what seems very clearly to
[50:45.480 --> 50:53.360]  be vindictive retaliation against them by TSA simply for raising you know raising
[50:53.360 --> 51:00.400]  some questions or objecting to what's been going on but the the lawsuits
[51:00.400 --> 51:07.480]  hopefully will will start clearing some of this up and you know people people
[51:07.480 --> 51:11.720]  need to not be intimidated they are they need to be polite they need to be
[51:11.720 --> 51:18.160]  respectful I don't never urged anybody not to be polite respectful if the
[51:18.160 --> 51:23.320]  government appears to be doing something that you know not to be proper and that
[51:23.320 --> 51:28.280]  your rights are being violated but it's a sad day when people find that simply
[51:28.280 --> 51:31.840]  because they question government authority and what government is doing
[51:31.840 --> 51:36.800]  that they then have retaliatory action taken against them well congressman
[51:36.800 --> 51:40.440]  that Congress ought to look into so this I'm sorry to interrupt so that is
[51:40.440 --> 51:44.160]  something Congress should look into absolutely they should the two committees
[51:44.160 --> 51:48.280]  that I indicated the government reform committee that will be chaired by
[51:48.280 --> 51:52.600]  Darrell Issa of California and the Transportation Committee that will be
[51:52.600 --> 51:57.520]  chaired by John Micah of Florida obviously you've got some gravitas as a
[51:57.520 --> 52:01.800]  long-serving former congressman you know committee chairman you were also in the
[52:01.800 --> 52:07.800]  CIA for many years hopefully they won't ignore your organizations for your
[52:07.800 --> 52:12.200]  request I don't think it's because request it's a demand under law but
[52:12.200 --> 52:18.000]  they ignore it so often as you know but I've tried to get my FBI file and they
[52:18.000 --> 52:22.840]  won't even respond I got a lawyer involved they said national security Lord
[52:22.840 --> 52:27.160]  knows what's in that thing do you think you'll get any success getting this
[52:27.160 --> 52:32.440]  information from the TSA and if you do what's the time frame generally now
[52:32.440 --> 52:36.280]  these things can take a long time unfortunately a lot longer than they
[52:36.280 --> 52:42.560]  than they should you know we hope to you know have the records within within
[52:42.560 --> 52:47.880]  20 days although they may respond that it takes longer for some reason or or
[52:47.880 --> 52:54.120]  whatnot I'm hopeful that the that will get at least some good information now
[52:54.120 --> 53:01.720]  from the FOIA request that we sent in on the 29th of November but you know we'll
[53:01.720 --> 53:06.680]  just have to wait and see it it is troubling that there certainly appears
[53:06.680 --> 53:13.680]  to be as you've already indicated a TSA stand down on the use of the full-body
[53:13.680 --> 53:19.560]  naked-body scanners on the days that there was a great deal of attention
[53:19.560 --> 53:25.840]  drawn to opting out even as the TSA was it was claiming that the use of these
[53:25.840 --> 53:31.320]  scanners is absolutely essential to protect the traveling public you know
[53:31.320 --> 53:38.000]  you can't have both ways absolutely a few final questions Jesse Ventura the
[53:38.000 --> 53:42.600]  former governor has talked about being groped here on air Ron Paul talked about
[53:42.600 --> 53:47.520]  I said did they touch your genitals he said yes it's totally disgusting other
[53:47.520 --> 53:51.560]  congressmen I've had on have said yes they've been groped but then senior
[53:51.560 --> 53:55.760]  committee chairman and cabinet members and Obama people if they're not on
[53:55.760 --> 54:01.480]  private jets they are exempt so a have you been groped congressman as someone
[54:01.480 --> 54:07.320]  who flies a lot and B what do you think of the fact that some people in
[54:07.320 --> 54:13.640]  government aren't exempt it's always I always get a kick out of you know these
[54:13.640 --> 54:17.560]  these big wigs in government you know saying oh you know it's okay for the
[54:17.560 --> 54:21.560]  American public don't worry these are you know these are essential steps and
[54:21.560 --> 54:24.920]  they're not they're not unconstitutional and they're not too
[54:24.920 --> 54:31.120]  invasive but they won't go through them even a few weeks ago for example when
[54:31.120 --> 54:37.160]  secretary Napolitano of the Department of Homeland Security was at an airport
[54:37.160 --> 54:42.320]  for a news conference announcing the installation of a bunch of these naked
[54:42.320 --> 54:47.080]  body scanners she was asked I think by the media to you know go ahead and go
[54:47.080 --> 54:51.280]  through and show us how it works and she refused you know these go these top
[54:51.280 --> 54:54.720]  government folks they don't they don't live like the rest of us they don't have
[54:54.720 --> 54:58.960]  to put up with this nonsense so it's easy for them to say that everybody else
[54:58.960 --> 55:05.400]  ought to do it and even some of those who are not in in top cabinet level or
[55:05.400 --> 55:11.840]  sub cabinet level positions but for example may have so-called security at
[55:11.840 --> 55:18.040]  details that travel with them don't have to go through the the same procedure so
[55:18.040 --> 55:22.640]  here again it's very easy for them to the UN diplomatic corps I mean the UN
[55:22.640 --> 55:26.640]  diplomatic corps doesn't have to but I mean have you specifically been touched
[55:26.640 --> 55:31.680]  inappropriately by by the TSA yeah I went through I went through one a few
[55:31.680 --> 55:39.000]  weeks ago and was told to to go through a one of the naked body scanners which I
[55:39.000 --> 55:48.840]  will not do and therefore was pulled aside for a manual search and I asked
[55:48.840 --> 55:53.880]  the the the TSA employee asked that are you do you suspect do you have a
[55:53.880 --> 55:57.880]  suspicion that I'm doing anything wrong that you know as the basis for the
[55:57.880 --> 56:02.520]  search they said oh no no no not at all and I said well then on what basis are
[56:02.520 --> 56:08.320]  you are you proposing to to search me on this way well you opted out so I said
[56:08.320 --> 56:14.440]  let me get this straight because you opt out of one unconstitutional search
[56:14.440 --> 56:19.160]  that it provides the justification for another unconstitutional search I mean
[56:19.160 --> 56:23.040]  these just circular arguments they don't know what they're doing sure has
[56:23.040 --> 56:28.120]  precious little Alex as you've already indicated to do with real security sure
[56:28.120 --> 56:31.520]  congressman specifically though because we need this on record I mean did they
[56:31.520 --> 56:40.400]  give you the the the the crotch pressing no oh good so he didn't do that to you
[56:40.400 --> 56:48.320]  no it was it was a very intrusive search but it I don't know what I would do if
[56:48.320 --> 56:52.680]  somebody tried that but now they didn't they didn't go that far amazing in
[56:52.680 --> 56:56.600]  closing we see Cass Sunstein at the White House I'm sure you've seen it being a
[56:56.600 --> 57:05.880]  civil libertarian openly saying shut down alternative media fine or arrest people
[57:05.880 --> 57:10.320]  that question man-made global warming we've got all these announcements by
[57:10.320 --> 57:14.640]  other czars that they want to restrict free speech we see these moves by Jay
[57:14.640 --> 57:18.920]  Rockefeller in his words we'd be better off never having the internet he talked
[57:18.920 --> 57:25.280]  about shutting down Fox News in a bizarre statement two weeks ago I mean the
[57:25.280 --> 57:30.720]  as the alternative media expands I see a perfect storm of the old dinosaur media
[57:30.720 --> 57:35.600]  and the government really having an end for the alternative media what's your
[57:35.600 --> 57:43.400]  take on their moves to start curtailing free speech this is always a danger with
[57:43.400 --> 57:49.000]  government Alex I remember it you know you're a lot younger than I am but I
[57:49.000 --> 57:52.960]  remember I was working for the government during the Nixon era Nixon
[57:52.960 --> 57:57.760]  tried this virtually every the only one I can remember that didn't try anything
[57:57.760 --> 58:02.880]  like this was probably Reagan but you know that there there's constant
[58:02.880 --> 58:09.640]  efforts Republican or Democratic administrations like to to control the
[58:09.640 --> 58:16.600]  media and there are so many more ways to get ideas out in the public arena now
[58:16.600 --> 58:21.880]  the good news is that those mechanisms are out there so people do have the
[58:21.880 --> 58:26.480]  the power and the ability to be much better informed but on the other hand it
[58:26.480 --> 58:30.880]  also provides a lot more mechanisms or vehicles for government to try and
[58:30.880 --> 58:36.840]  control amazing congressman they're doing it through the through the what's

[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:31.280]  under Reagan and what she discovered the bureaucracy was up to even then was
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:35.280]  amazing the deliberate dumbing down of our children she's coming up the next
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:41.280]  segment and by the way her book is going out of print we've got the last ones at

[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:04.280]  liberty is that this isn't just like the ACLU who you go throw yourself at the

[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:22.280]  letting the TSA know you're part of an organization that you're part of a
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:27.280]  group of people that are informed that you're not isolated and alone
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:31.280]  congressman I like the fact that you've got folks out there getting proactive as
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:37.280]  individuals tell us about Liberty Guard Liberty Guard is an organization that
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:43.280]  we've formed earlier this year with a group of you know very very good
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:50.280]  freedom lovers like you Alex to educate the American people with regard to
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:55.280]  much of what government is doing not just the TSA but other government
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:01.280]  agencies the privacy invasions and and so forth the evils of the growth of
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:06.280]  big government the corresponding loss of freedom and one of the projects that
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:12.280]  we've taken on as we've discussed here a little bit today is the opt-out
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:18.280]  alliance this is a cost nothing for people to get their opt-out alliance

[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.280]  absolutely in closing you got cut off by the break you were getting into the
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:08.280]  move towards censorship of media that from my research I've never seen in
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:12.280]  this country be as intense finish up that statement about one minute and
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:17.280]  we'll let you get back to work yeah it isn't it isn't just government going
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:23.280]  after media and new media outlets the alternative media the internet so forth
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:29.280]  it's all of the above and the the so-called net neutrality law or
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:35.280]  regulations that the FCC is pushing right now is part and parcel of that
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:40.280]  the government government as you know almost always tries to couch its
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:47.280]  steps to take away Liberty as Liberty enhancing you know sort of they are
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:52.280]  they are well in a bizarre a world approach to government but people need
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:56.280]  to watch out for this net neutrality law and the regulations as well yeah I've
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:00.280]  read the new FCC regulations and obviously you have that because you're
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:05.280]  you're accurately from my view addressing it it claims oh we're going to
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:10.280]  protect the internet but when you read it it's the FCC declaring regulation
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:14.280]  of the internet and when you get into the fine print of what they've said they
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:19.280]  want to start taxing it tracking it make you have an ID and that would be the
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.280]  end of the internet as we know it former congressman bob bar of liberty guard

[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:21.280]  Charlotte I know you've you've covered the history over and over again but if
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:25.280]  you could briefly tell us about yourself you know I mean you got the position
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:29.280]  because you were you know you know a great foreign service person really
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:33.280]  helped out your local schools didn't probably hurt your dad with skull and bones
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:37.280]  Bohemian Grove you know good family you know they're on the East Coast and you
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:41.280]  got into the Reagan administration and boy did you find something out so tell
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:45.280]  us about the basics and then get into the latest stuff because you say you've got
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:50.280]  some bombshell info for us well it is bombshell info because it's the
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:57.280]  the ultimate is the final nail in the coffin of what has been planned ever
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:03.280]  since the beginning of the last century by the elitist really upper class
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:09.280]  very wealthy families you can go back you know to the Whitney's the et cetera et
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:15.280]  cetera in the late 1800s as you know Alex they they had that meeting it's in
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:21.280]  tragedy and hope by Carol Quigley he was the president Clinton's mentor at
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:26.280]  Georgetown University Carol Quigley I have that original book of his but I don't
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:30.280]  know what page it is where he talked about how and this is a he was an
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:34.280]  historian for the council on foreign relations so he's not some little fly
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:38.280]  by night he said that these these individuals got together and they
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:43.280]  decided they had to basically control both parties at the top so that when
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:47.280]  the American people go to the polls we don't think we're going to get what we
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:52.280]  want but we won't because both parties are the same at the top now you know if
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:56.280]  I were about to die on my deathbed and someone asked me what was the most
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:01.280]  important thing for Americans to know of everything that I've found out in my
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:04.280]  years with a foreign service the department of that local football
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:09.280]  everything I would say that is it because the American people have got to
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:15.280]  understand that at the top both parties have the same agenda and that agenda is
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:21.280]  a planned economy and you can call her whatever you want you can call it a
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:27.280]  conservative planned economy or a communist planned economy or a Christian
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:33.280]  planned economy it doesn't make any difference it's a planned economy which
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:41.280]  means that your children will have no upward mobility at all there will be no
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:47.280]  future for them we will have no free market anymore with all the wonderful
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:52.280]  traffic to go with the free market like we have experienced at least I grew up
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:57.280]  in a wonderful America okay now that's why I say this is the last meal in the
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:00.280]  coffin and we're going to talk about that today but a little bit of my
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:04.280]  background local school board member most important thing that happened to me
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:08.280]  when I was fighting all the values destroying programs and all a retired
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.280]  teacher called me and said you're right on I want to pay for you to go for some
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:20.280]  training in innovations and education that was 1974 I went the trainer with
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:25.280]  being funded by the US Department of that which subsequently my office
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:31.280]  Ronald Havelach change agent manual how to become a change agent in the
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:36.280]  schools and I was trained on how to identify the resistors in my community
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.280]  well I it was very interesting to be trained how to identify yourself right
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:46.280]  the resistors are the smart people like your listeners who went up against
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:51.280]  sex at drug add alcohol and suicide add all the education programs that
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:55.280]  basically are geared to doing just the opposite of what they tell you they
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:59.280]  want your kids to commit suicide they want your kids to be promised to us
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:05.280]  that's the you know death education is a suicide thing they want your kids to
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:12.280]  take drugs order out of chaos they want apps exactly create okay that's what
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:16.280]  they did they had to create the chaos they did destroy our children's values
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:24.280]  and absolutely do away with any semblance of a an academic curriculum math
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:29.280]  science for no more four years of math science literature at the you know
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.280]  history etc get rid of history and all right when I went to that about
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:38.280]  identifying the resistors and then also identifying the important people in
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:42.280]  the community really good people and we all know a lot of them right head of
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:46.280]  the rotary head of the garden crop head of the historical society the
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:51.280]  important people you go to them and you you convince them that this is very
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:55.280]  important to put the sex ed program in or this suicide ed program or this
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:00.280]  bullying program or this whatever program that actually has nothing to do
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:04.280]  with anything to do with what parents want the schools to do and it sets the
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:10.280]  precedent I went through that and then I helped start a guardian of
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:15.280]  education for me and I of course I ran again for school board and I lost
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.280]  because they hated my guts by that time but hold on to your elected officials
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:22.280]  folks no matter what they can get rid of me that's right they should get rid of
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:25.280]  me if they have enough people to vote against me have to hold on to your
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:29.280]  elected officials and that's something I want to point out right now up there
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:32.280]  number two I said the most important thing to know is that the republic of
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:37.280]  the democrats the same number two is most important thing go up against any
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.280]  change in local governments where they're taking away your elected
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:46.280]  officials and then we are going to move into the basic thrust of my
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:50.280]  conversation today and I will go into history of the department that a bit
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:56.280]  too but the basic thrust in case Alex gets cut off is do not fall for any
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:02.280]  form of school choice unless it's homeschooling and you're not receiving
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:06.280]  any federal monies any tax monies at all no computer curriculum that is
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:11.280]  virtual computers like William Bennett's curriculum do not go there nothing
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:17.280]  that receives tax money is going to be legitimate because or or safe because
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:22.280]  you will have your child will have to take the federal test and the federal
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:28.280]  test is 60 percent attitudinal and that's why they want to support the
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:34.280]  teachers to have mirror pay performance based pay now to force the teachers
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:40.280]  into teaching to the federal international politically correct test now
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.280]  let me just throw this out there Charlotte briefly I mean that's the key
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:47.280]  is that no one of the test scores are dropping as you discovered they want
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:51.280]  you learning anything but reading writing and arithmetic it's all about
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:57.280]  basically being reeducated with diversity training and it sets the
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:01.280]  precedent for federal slash international curriculum and that's what
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:06.280]  Bella Melinda Gates are doing is is is running around accelerating this
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:10.280]  and it's school to work it's nothing but training your child there's a
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:16.280]  difference between training and education very big training bypasses the
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:21.280]  brain has nothing to do with your child being able to figure out what's going
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:25.280]  on in the world or have a conscience or anything the training is the
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:31.280]  skinner part Pavlovian the Pavlovian part it's all in my book all the
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:35.280]  documents are there especially appendices marvelous appendices which
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:40.280]  explain the Pavlovian method but also Alex what I'm doing what we're doing
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:47.280]  today for you is this great article the loss of free will is going to be up
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:52.280]  on my website and going to be sent to you and it's all these great links

[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:03.280]  conditioning is that this is what's going to go on in your child's classroom
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:08.280]  there will no longer be a true academic curriculum and the charter schools
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:12.280]  will be the schools to implement it they have they do not have elected
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:17.280]  school board charter schools charter schools they act like they're the same
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:22.280]  as public schools but they do they say they're innovative and your view can
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:25.280]  your parents are so happy because they can get their children out of this
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:29.280]  mess so they destroy the old schools right and then they bring in the new
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:34.280]  corporate schools absolutely that the public school teachers will jump ship
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:38.280]  and this is what I've said all along what happened jump ship from the
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:44.280]  traditional public school system with it's extremely good I might say set up
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:48.280]  I mean sure sure they have to destroy it before they rebuild it Charlotte stay

[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:28.280]  they wanted people to regurgitate info
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:32.280]  not to actually be taught a classical education of how to think
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.280]  and to learn the love of thought but to be drones
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:40.280]  so that they could decide what slot in life you would fill
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:44.280]  they wanted hessian soldiers who would sacrifice themselves in war
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:48.280]  unquestioningly so you're at the department of education you start discovering

[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:12.280]  mentally ill we have all these quotes but there's a very good quote
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:16.280]  but that's what we're really looking at and of course have to change the values
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:20.280]  completely destroy any values that children have religious
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:24.280]  towards the country and all and that's been sort of done in case
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:28.280]  we wonder what's going on out in the street there with these
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:32.280]  sad-looking children and dropping out of school and all
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:36.280]  that has been done now it's the re-freezing what is
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:40.280]  what you would call it and the goal has been reached and i just want
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:44.280]  to read this is a new quote alec that i found the other day
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:48.280]  i give credit to a wonderful researcher who passed away so
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:52.280]  i guess our gene potten from indiana brilliant she was very
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:56.280]  good on english literature at all and she wrote a little booklet i can't
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:00.280]  remember the name of it right now but this quote is in it and it is
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:04.280]  from woodrow wilton it's very important this is when
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:08.280]  he was president of princeton university
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:12.280]  and i addressed to the federation of high school teachers
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:16.280]  and the quote was published in consumer advocates in the classroom
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:20.280]  by gene potten okay now listen to this it's it's
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:24.280]  better even than the gates quote you know the rocker for one the
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:28.280]  southern education board where they talked about uh you know with
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:32.280]  the minorities and all just uh we don't need doctors lawyers

[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:40.280]  happy down on the farm huh but this is even better here we go
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:44.280]  this is woodrow wilton this is pre before he was president
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:48.280]  quote we want one class of persons
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:52.280]  to have a liberal education and we want another class
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:56.280]  of persons a very much larger class of necessity
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:00.280]  in every society to forego the
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:04.280]  privilege of a liberal education and fit
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:08.280]  themselves to perform specific
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:12.280]  difficult manual tasks and quote
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:16.280]  wow that is dynamite now
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:20.280]  that folks is exactly what's going in now and let me point
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:24.280]  out to you i had no idea when i got into the u.s. department of that i was a
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:28.280]  great fan of ronald regens who are in quotes huh
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.280]  and i go when i got in there i had no idea i was going to find this i i didn't know
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.280]  anything about school to work i knew everything i believe about
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:40.280]  values clarification i had even gone through sydney simon's values clarification
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:44.280]  because i don't believe in talking about anything or writing about anything unless you've been through it
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:48.280]  so i knew that the major goal in the 60s
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:52.280]  and 70s and into the 80s was to destroy our
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:56.280]  children's moral values but i had no idea until i got
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:00.280]  into the department of ed and ronald regens promised to get rid of it
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:04.280]  and he didn't on purpose and if people think it was a mistake it wasn't
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:08.280]  he was not what people think anyway i got in there and i started
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:12.280]  seeing all these things that led me to believe that they were focusing on
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:16.280]  workforce training and then i got a hold of
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:20.280]  the project best better education skills through technology
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:24.280]  which is the computer curriculum which is total skinner because skinner
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:28.280]  said the computer was his box and bf skinner is the one who said
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:32.280]  i could make a pigeon your child a high achiever
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:36.280]  by reinforcing it on a proper schedule
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:40.280]  and the secretary of education right now under obama
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:44.280]  has said that he believes in well they believe in merit pay
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:48.280]  that's the same thing for the teachers and for the students
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:52.280]  he believes in paying them for good grades well skinner would love this
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:56.280]  this is absolutely down his alley a whole country
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:00.280]  has been subjected and is being right now to padlock

[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:36.280]  takeover which they now admit is a federal takeover of the streets
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:40.280]  of america and of all commerce not just airlines
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:44.280]  that's in trouble when we stand up and say no we can have
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:48.280]  an effect okay so this is a great tool in that fight
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:52.280]  charlotte iserby please continue breaking down
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:56.280]  the new developments and then the final nail in the
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:00.280]  coffin with the takeover of education and what their in game is
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:04.280]  okay well the goal is to implement the international
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:08.280]  planned economy and most of you know about that using total quality management
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:12.280]  that's why the corporations are so deeply involved in our schools right now
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:16.280]  and as I said this started out when I was in my office
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:20.280]  in the office of educational research improvement I saw that
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:24.280]  when Ronald Reagan set up an office in the White House
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:28.280]  for it was called private
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:32.280]  sector initiatives
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:36.280]  and my boss made a mistake sending me over the
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:40.280]  White House as a liaison so I went over and I just
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:44.280]  innocently said you know I'm not highly educated but when you merge
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:48.280]  the public and private sector which is what it was all about
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:52.280]  isn't that corporate fascism and it's probably
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:56.280]  ladies said well gee I don't know whether anybody really thought of it that way
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:00.280]  or they did and that was exactly the beginning of this
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:04.280]  merger of the public and private sector which the nicest thing you
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:08.280]  can call it is corporate fascism but basically it's
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:12.280]  socialism and it's communism and it is a planned economy and that is not
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:16.280]  the American way now you can say oh well that can't happen in our schools
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:20.280]  oh yes it can it's happening through they had to destroy
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:24.280]  the schools first to make them so horrible that parents at all
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:28.280]  would accept anything and so they talk about school
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:32.280]  choice it sounds so nice that means parents are really happy they're going to be able to put their
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:36.280]  child into a school that teaches the three R's and sound values are
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:40.280]  no folks the school choice is lethal they're
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:44.280]  going to bring our country down and change our whole form of government
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:48.280]  an economic system through school choice
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:52.280]  and charter schools now I know there are people out there who are really shocked
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:56.280]  because they're going to be saying oh well my conservative great conservative organization
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:00.280]  that I give money to in the heritage foundation all these American
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:04.280]  conservative union and all these conservative groups support school choice
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:08.280]  well folks look join the crowd with me
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:12.280]  can you imagine how dismayed I am that's hardly the word
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:16.280]  I thought I was a conservative now I don't know who hates me the most
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:20.280]  I think the conservatives hate me more than the left
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:24.280]  because at least the left tells the truth about what they're doing
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:28.280]  we've counted on the conservatives
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:32.280]  to save us to save our children to save our schools to save our
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:36.280]  country no don't count on them at all you might do better
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:40.280]  counting on good teachers that are still left in the
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:44.280]  system and supporting them in stopping
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:48.280]  performance based teacher education
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:52.280]  and stopping charter schools
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:56.280]  and insisting at the state level that you get into the education
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:00.280]  legislation and bring your schools back
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:04.280]  to the traditional K through 12 no workforce
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:08.280]  training like recommended by Woodrow Wilson no political correct
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:12.280]  brainwashing where they spend all day teaching everybody
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:16.280]  absolutely no teachers would be hired
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:20.280]  according to a lot about their background
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:24.280]  interview them to find out they're happily married
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:28.280]  what are their values do you want them
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:32.280]  in charge of your children we would return
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:36.280]  our schools to what they used to be
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:40.280]  and I can assure you there are many American teachers out there right now
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:44.280]  as bad as you may think they all are and some are especially the young
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:48.280]  brainwash there seems to be only one way to go
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:52.280]  and that is to try to work with the teachers
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:56.280]  in the public schools system believe it or not and with the teachers
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:00.280]  union that is fighting the performance based teacher education
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:04.280]  because what if you don't do this we've had it
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:08.280]  I never thought I would get to the point where I would have to recommend
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:12.280]  that this is the only place to go because I cannot find a single
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:16.280]  conservative organization in the country that is willing to admit
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:20.280]  that they are imposing a planned economy on us
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:24.280]  to school choice but that's what Webster Tarpley
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:28.280]  wrote in his three books on Obama that Obama's job was posing as a liberal
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:32.280]  and busting up Chicago schools not to fix
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:36.280]  them but to hand them over to Bill and Melinda Gates who literally
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:40.280]  teach the kids that one child policy is good
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:44.280]  humans are bad they admit even 2020 as you know back
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:48.280]  in the early 90s reported that when they brought death education in that you warned
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:52.280]  about it teaches the kids how to commit suicide and then
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:56.280]  suicide explodes they bring in more death education more drugs
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:00.280]  suicide explodes more prozac which causes
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:04.280]  suicide suicide explodes I mean they are so diabolical
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:08.280]  but the average grassroots person implementing this is compartmentalized
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:12.280]  and just goes ahead with the program believing the label
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:16.280]  well that's right but I mean we are really far past that
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:20.280]  now we moved out of the values destroying stuff
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:24.280]  they've done their job which is the unfreezing right and then
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:28.280]  they come in with the freezing and the freezing is the workforce training
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:32.280]  which will require no brain activity because if you study
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:36.280]  scanner if you understand animal training
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:40.280]  hold on hold on hold on briefly explain to people scanner we got time here
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:44.280]  explain explain scanner and then explain freezing unfreezing
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:48.280]  well be a scanner first of all you know I put the quote first about
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:52.280]  I could make a pigeon a high achiever by reinforcing
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:56.280]  it on a proper schedule okay just think about your dog okay everybody has
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:00.280]  dogs or something right well you know you can train it's very easy to train your dog
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:04.280]  with you know Fido said if you give the dog a dog biscuit
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:08.280]  next time you say Fido said he's going to look for the dog biscuit right
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:12.280]  and he's going to say so this is what they're doing with your children in the classroom
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:16.280]  now this is workforce training there is no thinking going on in
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:20.280]  Fido's head it's just neurological if you understand you go to the
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:24.280]  doctor he used to do this there's a rubber hammer he hits your knee
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:28.280]  and your knee pops up that's reaction that's not
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:32.280]  thinking now this is what is necessary for
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:36.280]  workforce training and it has been admitted to by all the key
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:40.280]  behaviorist boy wait they admit that's what they've done with police is
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:44.280]  reflexive their brainwash drones the TV lowers people's
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:48.280]  brainwaves we have a drone zombie population
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:52.280]  well yes and I was saying you know it's not too funny but I've been
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:56.280]  talking for so long Alex that I
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:00.280]  when I read the news and everything I'm quite numb now
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:04.280]  everything I'm really numb so I think a lot of your listeners can relate
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:08.280]  to that they feel numb too and they're great and by the way to be clear
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:12.280]  you have graphics put up by the Department of Education where they say
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:16.280]  they want brainwash zombies I mean the whole book is just
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:20.280]  nightmare control freaks saying we're ending the family
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:24.280]  people won't be able to talk when we're done with them it's basically 1984 already
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:28.280]  the language is being made a lot smaller just like
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:32.280]  we all talked about where you can't communicate with many people now because
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:36.280]  they literally can't even understand you no you can't and let me
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:40.280]  point out before we I want to get this done because people may
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:44.280]  you know they say oh wow I wish I had a panel I'll write this down
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:48.280]  how am I going to check that or whatever they have to go to the website the two websites
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:52.280]  one is deliberate coming down dot com
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:56.280]  and that has all my articles on it and there is there's the exchange
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:00.280]  of correspondence between myself and President Lincoln
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:04.280]  where I informed him after I had been dismissed from my job
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:08.280]  for leaking a document to human events on workforce training basically
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:12.280]  better education skills through technology actually
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:16.280]  I wrote him after I was dismissed to tell him that this department
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:20.280]  was a Marxist factory and that letter is there I never got a
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:24.280]  response of course I didn't he didn't want anybody even a response
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:28.280]  better nothing more than that he didn't want me to be able to say that
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:32.280]  he had received it huh he received my letter he very well was going on
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:36.280]  you know three years later he signed the agreement with Gorbachev to merge
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:40.280]  the education systems at the same time Carnegie signed with the
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:44.280]  Soviet Academy of Science to merge the two systems
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:48.280]  and that's UNESCO all on record and so
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:52.280]  that happened and then
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:56.280]  this is what I'm trying to point out right now that website is very important
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:00.280]  that's a PDF that letter now there's another PDF there
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:04.280]  it's called experimentation on minorities and I've got all the goods on them
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:08.280]  they used the minorities with the Skinner method from the beginning
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:12.280]  from 1965 with the elementary and secondary education act
[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:16.280]  they just targeted the minorities to see if this workforce training thing
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:20.280]  would work they used it on them that's why the minorities test scores went down
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:24.280]  Chicago was one of their first schools in
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:28.280]  1968 they put it I think in 1982
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:32.280]  the test scores were so horrible in Chicago after using the
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:36.280]  Skinner method that
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:40.280]  Education Week which is their big education journal
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:44.280]  said it was called
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:48.280]  they called Chicago a human tragedy
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:52.280]  well they even took away phonics where you've got to look at a word and then
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:56.280]  remember it they know that doesn't work they got rid of what worked by design
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:00.280]  I mean I've got stuff from 1898 by the US Banking Association
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:04.280]  saying we've got to take over education and dumb them down
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:08.280]  too many people are reading I mean you try to read a newspaper from 200 years ago
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:12.280]  I can't even read it I mean they have literally turned us
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:16.280]  Alex I was going to talk to people later in my website
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:20.280]  they told them that deliberatedummydown.com but at AmericanDeception.com
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:24.280]  you were just talking about something interesting made me think of it
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:28.280]  there is an incredible test
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:32.280]  and I'm trying to think of the name I wish I could remember that test
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:36.280]  Cal, Kenneth
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:40.280]  Higley
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:44.280]  it'll pop in your head in a minute the point is
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:48.280]  it's on the website
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:52.280]  and it's Hignite
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:56.280]  if you write anything down today write this down
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:00.280]  because I consider this is the proof that you can take out
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:04.280]  and show people the name is Kenny Hignite
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:08.280]  H-I-G-N-I-T-E
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:12.280]  you type that into the search engine at AmericanDeception.com
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:16.280]  an 8 or 10 page test on the constitution
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:20.280]  Kenny Hignite got 99 on it I think excellent 8 plus or something
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:24.280]  that test it's all in his own handwriting
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:28.280]  someone gave me this test when I was speaking somewhere and it's all in his own handwriting
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:32.280]  he felt his handwriting was not that good but boy is he smart
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:36.280]  now a lot of people say oh he's a genius no wonder that has nothing to do with it
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:40.280]  this is what was expected of American public school
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:44.280]  in 1953 in Central California
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:48.280]  they had to know the Bill of Rights they had to know all the Supreme Court justices by name
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:52.280]  they had to know the division of
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:56.280]  powers all the different divisions of government
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:47:00.280]  you name it everything the constitution
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:04.280]  term limits you know whatever go and look at that
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:08.280]  Kenny Hignite this is for people who will say to you look at
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:12.280]  well I think my children you know seem to be really doing very well
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:16.280]  and you know what the point is it's not your children I would say
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:20.280]  I'm dumb I'm dumb myself I couldn't pass
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:24.280]  that test so there's no question that this has been a deliberate
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:28.280]  delivery thing now the other thing which is the reason we started
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:34.280]  the American Deception website and now I have 150,000 pages
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:38.280]  in hand scanned of original documents
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:42.280]  my son did this I don't know how he ever did it
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:46.280]  on that website and they deal with religion the occult
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:50.280]  tremendous amount of education documents
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:54.280]  tremendous documents in World War II showing all sorts of things
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:58.280]  none of us knew World War I the unbelievable
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:02.280]  website but the one document that I bought
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:06.280]  there was one left the congressional record
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:10.280]  the hearings on the tax exempt foundation
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:14.280]  in 1953 that were abruptly shut down
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:18.280]  by the Eisenhower administration and others of course
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:22.280]  and this is the Norman Dodd story because
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:26.280]  he was the research director these are the congressional
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:30.280]  hearings investigating the tax exempt foundation
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:34.280]  3,000 pages I paid 3,000 dollars
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:38.280]  now I understand that the person
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:42.280]  I bought them from he was offered any amount
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:46.280]  to get that one copy any amount
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:50.280]  this was 20 years ago one of the minions in the foundation came
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:54.280]  and said we will pay you anything you want for that
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:58.280]  now folks that's available to you
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:02.280]  on that website AmericanDeception.com
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:06.280]  you will find out how the tax exempt foundation has taken
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:10.280]  your country from you for their own purposes
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:14.280]  well for those that don't know I want to back you up here
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:18.280]  and actually read coming up after the break
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:22.280]  the actual quote by Carol Quigley but it's simple you've got less than
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:26.280]  20 robber baron families and over 110 years
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:30.280]  ago they publicly got together and said we've got a through government
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:34.280]  take over society and vertically integrate society and they had the
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:38.280]  Jekyll Island meeting in Georgia they took over our monetary system
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:42.280]  and they have turned us into basically the equivalent of retarded
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:46.280]  monkeys and for those of us that can still think
[01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:50.280]  Charlotte how do we reach out to people
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:54.280]  who literally don't even know what town they're in
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:58.280]  I mean you see the people even yuppies that have decent jobs
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:02.280]  they think it's cool to be stupid
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:06.280]  well I think we really are we're in major trouble and I always start joking with one of your guys there
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:10.280]  when I said I'm so you know I've seen so much
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:14.280]  of the horrible stuff that my brain is numb huh and I think
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:18.280]  a lot of us feel that way so I said we're all really quite numb now
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:22.280]  and everybody else is dumb so who's
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:26.280]  dumber? I mean the people who've done the research
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:30.280]  and have been screaming and yelling and speaking like myself and you Alex
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:34.280]  all over the place thank god for you
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:38.280]  don't you sometimes Alex when you open up your internet and your emails
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:42.280]  go to look at it and feel numb
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:46.280]  yeah well sometimes I get numb more often
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:50.280]  I get absolutely outraged

[01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:16.280]  Carol Quigley writing for tragedy and hope he was commissioned by the US
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:20.280]  government for high level state department employees to actually understand
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:24.280]  the globalist agenda so they could carry out this operation
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:28.280]  against us. The argument that the two parties should represent
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:32.280]  opposed ideas and policies one perhaps on the right the other on the left
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:36.280]  is a foolish idea acceptable only to the
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:40.280]  doctrine and academic thinkers instead
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:44.280]  the two parties should be almost identical so the American
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:48.280]  people can throw the rascals out in quotes at any election
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:52.280]  without leading to any profound or extreme shifts in policy
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:56.280]  and we're already seeing the Republicans that have gotten into office the leadership
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:00.280]  continuing everything but but so much of it is just
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:04.280]  lies I mean the public doesn't even understand how big
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:08.280]  corporations work so you try to tell them hey insurance companies wrote the healthcare
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:12.280]  bill it's a fact the healthcare lobbyist
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:16.280]  had was for it they wrote it you tell them that they're like
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:20.280]  shut up you work for the insurance companies the oil companies the big mega
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:24.280]  companies wrote the carbon tax takeover because they're home of the banks
[01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:28.280]  you tell the average liberal that they just cannot listen to you because they're brain damaged they're brainwashed
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:32.280]  it's like a mainline conservative you explain to them that big agribusiness
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:36.280]  wrote the takeover of the farms and ranches this food
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:40.280]  safety act they won't go check that that's a fact and that big agribusiness bank
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:44.280]  rolled it they just liberals think big governments there to help
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:48.280]  them conservatives think big corporations are there to help them they don't
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:52.280]  know big corporations created big government to give them government
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:56.280]  power to rob you going back to charlotte israeli I just want to point
[01:55:56.280 --> 01:56:00.280]  out folks that there's only 800 of these books and I'm kind of shocked
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:04.280]  because looks like we've already sold 20% of them in the last 50
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:08.280]  minutes so I mean this this books basically been pretty much out of
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:12.280]  print and charlotte's been selling them again on her site but now we've bought
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:16.280]  them all and they're available discounted at infowars.com
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:20.280]  or 888-25-33139 every
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:24.280]  educator needs to have this every school board needs to be shown this this is their internal
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:28.280]  documents this is the smoking gun proof this is how we bring the criminals
[01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:32.280]  to justice the average person won't believe this stuff because it's so outlandish but look
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:36.280]  at what our country's begun I mean look what it's turned into no dodgeball
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:40.280]  no chase no hugging it's prisoner training
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:44.280]  oh yeah it really is and Alex I think that I'm so glad
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:48.280]  that you have bought the remaining copies and I would recommend
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:52.280]  for these these books should be going into the hands of
[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:56.280]  there are good educators out there and make sure they get into
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:00.280]  the hands of good educators and legislators to online education committees
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:04.280]  interstate legislatures because as I said it's
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:08.280]  going to be very very difficult and we may not win this battle but the only way
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:12.280]  we can go right now is to try to hold on to the traditional
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:16.280]  structure of the school with the superintendent
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:20.280]  the elected school board well Charlotte look what happened a year ago
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:24.280]  K through 12 curriculum let me point out the new curriculum it's going in the
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:28.280]  main it's terrible it's going to some students will
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:32.280]  graduate at 14 years old
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:36.280]  and some at 21 there will be no no
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:40.280]  grades anymore I mean K through 12 no summer ABCD
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:44.280]  all school to work no summer
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:48.280]  they're trying to get rid of summer education but look how they're also in Illinois
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:52.280]  and California remember that case two years ago where the state announced
[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:56.280]  we own your children you can home school I mean that shows their
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:58:00.280]  mindset well yeah and so the thing is we've got to go all the way back
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:04.280]  get rid of the department at Washington get rid of your state department
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:08.280]  of that in your in your state once Americans
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:12.280]  stand what they're doing right now and they're using school choice to do it
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:16.280]  do not forget that folks that's the key
[01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:20.280]  they're using that it's the most evil
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:24.280]  defeat I in my career ever since I went

[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:20.280]  really superb I think it's the best thing that's ever been put together a friend of mine
[02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:24.280]  helped me put it together I wrote it basically but it's called
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:28.280]  the death of free will and it's about the re-inventing
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:32.280]  school's coalition that's going all over the country and I told you about the kids that
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:36.280]  graduate at 14 and once at 21
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:40.280]  the whole public school system has been completely dismantled to put this
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:44.280]  in now this particular article covers all the old
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:48.280]  posts some of which I've used today it covers
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:52.280]  some clicks for a video of Jed Brown a great
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:56.280]  educator who died a few years ago who explained behavioral conditioning
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:00.280]  he had his own rap when he was going through university training in
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:04.280]  psychology that's a click on the internet people can
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:08.280]  see that I'm sending this through to you it's called the death of free will
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:12.280]  December 2010 and Alex if you
[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:16.280]  would put that up on your website I would appreciate it
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:20.280]  absolutely in fact when we say bye to you here in a moment
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:24.280]  I will make sure that you're sending it to the right person we'll post it within the next
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:28.280]  20 minutes or so at infowars.com and
[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:32.280]  prisonplanet.com in its entirety and I think we did
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:36.280]  shut down your website we were trying to access it a few minutes ago it was frozen
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:40.280]  and basically down but
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:44.280]  again just amazing work you've done so bottom line
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:48.280]  federalized the schools they bring in the skinner brainwashing now
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:52.280]  they're corporatizing the schools when what we
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:56.280]  really need is the counties and cities around the schools and we don't
[02:02:56.280 --> 02:03:00.280]  really have real independent school districts anymore we need to get back to that
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:04.280]  and kick the feds out because and again you were there you
[02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:08.280]  had this up you witnessed it this is their plan I saw the whole thing and the fact that
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:12.280]  it happened under Ronald Reagan his stuff both shocking and not only
[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:16.280]  did it happen in the department under him but then he went even you know
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:20.280]  to Geneva and signed the agreement for the Soviet Union so that
[02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:24.280]  he could put the Soviet system in briefly we got a minute and a half
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:28.280]  left I mean that's on record but folks don't know about the UNESCO agreements tell people
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:32.280]  well the UNESCO agreements are really not though I mean they're horrible they were
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:36.280]  in 1948 and they can they're the whole value
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:40.280]  sure it's just from the Gorbachev stuff I've read that that continues on that line but just briefly
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:44.280]  then the Soviet agreement the Soviet agreement is
[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:48.280]  putting in the method putting getting rid of great
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:52.280]  getting rid of competition putting in the community
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:56.280]  stuff which we see today everything's community community this and that
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:04:00.280]  and there's some really interesting documents in my book about American
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:04.280]  educators who visited the Soviet Union and went through their schools
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:08.280]  and talked about this is back 40-50 years ago and said we don't have
[02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:12.280]  that here well by God we have it now
[02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:16.280]  I didn't get what he did
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:20.280]  where the children are little tattletale spies who can't even
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:24.280]  write their names oh yes I mean that the allegiance is to the state
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:28.280]  not to their parents anymore and that's why you may have
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:32.280]  a problem with your children at the dining room table their values are totally
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:36.280]  contrary to yours but this sort of thing can be changed
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:40.280]  but you can't change it until you change the
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:44.280]  dimensions of the curriculum and you support the good teachers
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:48.280]  well Charlotte the author of deliberate dumbing down available going out of print at infowars.com

[02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:08.280]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:12.280]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:16.280]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:20.280]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:24.280]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:28.280]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:32.280]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:36.280]  grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:40.280]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance

[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:44.280]  to actually see it happen i've seen homeland security for seven years
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:48.280]  with governor ridge seven years ago on c span
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:52.280]  admit that the tsa will decide through homeland
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:56.280]  security if you can have a job they're going to run security
[02:08:56.280 --> 02:09:00.280]  on the highways the malls buildings
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:04.280]  this is the new service economy
[02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:08.280]  this is the post industrial america where the government taxes the population
[02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:12.280]  and then hires tens of millions
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:16.280]  just like they had a large percentage of the population
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:20.280]  being little spygoons in east germany under the
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:24.280]  stasi it's the same thing here and here's the drudge report
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:28.280]  he's got her press release out
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:32.280]  big sis invades walmart
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:36.280]  if you see something say something
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:40.280]  and they already have these in the airports but now
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:44.280]  it's going to be at all of the walmart locations
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:48.280]  more than 230 walmart stores
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:52.280]  they go on and announce it's going to be rolling out on the streets
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:56.280]  billboards just training everyone to spy on each other
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:10:00.280]  but the borders wide open
[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:04.280]  this is the federalization of everything checkpoints on the highways
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:08.280]  checkpoints at the malls they're already doing it in fact we have articles
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:12.280]  dealing with it today paul joseph watson tsa style
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:16.280]  pat downs hit the streets and it's local police
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:20.280]  with the tsa running checkpoints searching
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:24.280]  people right out of north korea east germany
[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:28.280]  it's just so horrible to see this happening
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:32.280]  also intelligence contractor floats idea of body
[02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:36.280]  cavity searches that's curtain
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:40.280]  new york daily news says that a message board used by al qaeda
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:44.280]  talked about putting bombs in people's stomachs or
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:48.280]  in their you know what
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:52.280]  and so now maybe they're going to have to do proctology exams
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:56.280]  see government has demanded that people sacrifice
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:00.280]  their first born to pharaoh government has demanded that
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:04.280]  the ashtex give us your kids this is what control freaks
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:08.280]  always build it's like a tropism like a plant grows and aims at the
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:12.280]  sun to get the sunshine for photosynthesis tyrants
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:16.280]  like black uniforms human sacrifice wars deaths
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:20.280]  they like their their sadist
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:24.280]  and good people tend to lick boots and do what they're told
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:28.280]  and the government staging the terror attacks they are a corrupt group
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:32.280]  that has robbed and stolen the public blind and they know what they're doing
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:36.280]  so here it is in fact let me just go ahead and read over some of this
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:40.280]  the department of homeland security
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:44.280]  dhs secretary janton apolitano today announced the expansion of the
[02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:48.280]  department's national if you see something say something
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:52.280]  that now is going to be on the streets of america campaign
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:56.280]  to hundreds of walmart stores see walmart is basically a government front
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:12:00.280]  by bm just like microsoft it's come out there involved in c o g
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:04.280]  programs martial law programs
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:08.280]  force inoculation centers have been designated under the model
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:12.280]  states health emergency powers act walmart is key a key criminal organization
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:16.280]  that must be boycotted you want to boycott pure evil walmart

[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:24.280]  walmart stores across the country launching a new partnership between
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:28.280]  dhs and walmart to help the american public play an active
[02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:32.280]  role in ensuring the safety and security of our nation
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:36.280]  so a federal spying arm homeland security starts with hometown
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:40.280]  security and each of us plays a critical role imagine people
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:44.280]  all over the country in walmart's buying their cheap chinese slave goods
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:48.280]  with big billboards that says tv screens saying watch out for
[02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:52.280]  suspicious people call the feds call police i mean
[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:56.280]  right out of 1984
[02:12:56.280 --> 02:13:00.280]  listen how they say it all folksy homeland security
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:04.280]  starts with hometown security and each of us
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:08.280]  plays a critical role in keeping our country and our community
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:12.280]  safe who keeps us safe from the bankers said
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:16.280]  secretary napolitano and they have video announcements
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:20.280]  of her down the walmart's i applaud walmart for joining the

[02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:28.280]  that goes into towns to leverage out their competition and use chinese slave goods
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:32.280]  to kill all their competition i see walmart caught going in and
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:36.280]  hiring a bunch of egg producers to produce eggs
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:40.280]  knowing that within a year it'll knock out all their competition then they can triple prices
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:44.280]  i see a mafia organization that hates this country
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:48.280]  oh you got lots of big big american flags singing made in america
[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:52.280]  so all the good old boys can walk in and go there's a big billboard says made

[02:13:56.280 --> 02:14:00.280]  and you got the old people it's come out who they do actuaries on
[02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:04.280]  they know statistically when they're gonna die and they get two three million dollars of insurance
[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:08.280]  money on them and then and then never tell the family they had insurance on grandma
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:12.280]  you're like oh they heard my 85 year old grandma who's had double bypasses

[02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:24.280]  vicious organization i'm sorry
[02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:28.280]  if you see something say something campaign originally implemented
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:32.280]  by new york's metropolitan transportation authority and funded in part

[02:32:04.280 --> 02:32:08.280]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[02:32:08.280 --> 02:32:12.280]  electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[02:32:12.280 --> 02:32:16.280]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government

[02:32:20.280 --> 02:32:24.280]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:32:24.280 --> 02:32:28.280]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:32:28.280 --> 02:32:32.280]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:32:32.280 --> 02:32:36.280]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages

[02:34:22.280 --> 02:34:26.280]  people down in Florida and Texas just last week but now

[02:34:42.280 --> 02:34:46.280]  saying watch your neighbors report stuff literally with
[02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:50.280]  Napolitano right out of 1984
[02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:54.280]  I haven't been in a Walmart in years but you better believe I'm going to
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:58.280]  be going to and it's going to be everywhere just in America TV
[02:34:58.280 --> 02:35:02.280]  screens and of course it'll be al Qaeda one day and then does your neighbor have guns
[02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:06.280]  or are you following the new green
[02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:10.280]  rules government media just in our
[02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:14.280]  lives while the government's been taken over by foreign banks stealing everything
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:18.280]  we currently owe right at 14 trillion of the bankers all
[02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:22.280]  made up fiat through fraud Bernie Madoff was part of it
[02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:26.280]  Kinley set up the carbon tax Bernie Madoff founded Nasdaq
[02:35:26.280 --> 02:35:30.280]  these are crooks these are crooks hard core
[02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:34.280]  crooks who set up a wonderland where they run the FBI the
[02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:38.280]  police the police are like Roy heads on average is completely dumb down
[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:42.280]  a general public on power trips we are in so much trouble
[02:35:42.280 --> 02:35:46.280]  the government's run murdering mass murder wars everywhere
[02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:50.280]  I mean we are this wicked demonic empire we've killed 50
[02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:54.280]  million babies in abortion they're poisoning the water
[02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:58.280]  supply and then look at the CNBC report the Fed has
[02:35:58.280 --> 02:36:02.280]  110 billion problem with new Benjamin's they printed
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:06.280]  the bills wrong the 3D security strip and color shifting
[02:36:06.280 --> 02:36:10.280]  had a problem I'm sure this is some scam I'm sure somebody's getting
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:14.280]  110 bills why not they can stick their hands down our pants
[02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:18.280]  and radiate us why not the total face value of the usable bills
[02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:22.280]  110 billion represents more than 10% of the entire supply of US
[02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:26.280]  currency on the planet and about two thirds of the money's outside the US
[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:30.280]  so in the US
[02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:34.280]  you know we're talking about maybe
[02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:38.280]  more than this for now the unusable bills are stored in vaults
[02:36:38.280 --> 02:36:42.280]  as cash packs or four bundles of 4,000 each
[02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:46.280]  with each pack containing 16,000 bills
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:50.280]  I'm sure there's some scam behind this but that gives you an example that they're telling you
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:54.280]  that there's only a fraction of paper
[02:36:54.280 --> 02:36:58.280]  money compared to all of the debt 1.5
[02:36:58.280 --> 02:37:02.280]  quadrillion with around 600 trillion of it owed by you and I
[02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:06.280]  and what is that debt it's derivatives
[02:37:06.280 --> 02:37:10.280]  created by Goldman Sachs JP Morgan and others and who funds all this
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:14.280]  police state who funds your kids being federalized in schools being brainwashed
[02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:18.280]  the same stinking crooks it's us or them
[02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:22.280]  haven't you figured that out yet we're all in incredible danger
[02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:26.280]  they don't stop just shooting poor black folks up with syphilis

[02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:14.280]  one-child policy uncle ted has five children but
[02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:18.280]  once the new order is done with its economic raping of the middle class
[02:46:18.280 --> 02:46:22.280]  you may be forced to get sterilized for cash that's why they want to make you
[02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:26.280]  bankrupt just months after elite un blueprint revealed climate change
[02:46:26.280 --> 02:46:30.280]  alarmist will start pushing overpopulation fears in favor of the
[02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:34.280]  discredited mantra of global warming as a means of dismantling the
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:38.280]  middle class billionaire globalist ted turner followed suit during
[02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:42.280]  a cancun luncheon yesterday when he urged the world to adopt
[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:46.280]  china's brutal one-child policy and even suggested poor people should
[02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:50.280]  be sterilized and returned for government handouts see they take your job by design
[02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:54.280]  and sterilize you following a speech by economist brian o'neill
[02:46:54.280 --> 02:46:58.280]  from the u.s. national center for atmospheric research which concluded
[02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:02.280]  that a rapidly rising global population
[02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:06.280]  is contributing to an acceleration of a mission
[02:47:06.280 --> 02:47:10.280]  growth carbon dioxide we exhale instead turners
[02:47:10.280 --> 02:47:14.280]  buddy bill gates said uncle ted stepped in to
[02:47:14.280 --> 02:47:18.280]  remind us that mere slaves should not aspire to follow his example
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:22.280]  of having five children restricting themselves to one are being made to face
[02:47:22.280 --> 02:47:26.280]  the wrath of chinese style one policy which sins women
[02:47:26.280 --> 02:47:30.280]  who defy its edicts to reeducation camps once they've been beaten
[02:47:30.280 --> 02:47:34.280]  forcibly injected and had their baby boiled alive inside their wombs of course
[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:38.280]  any links to the mainstream news admitting all of
[02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:42.280]  that mr. Turner a long time advocate of population
[02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:46.280]  control and the environmental stress on the earth requires radical solutions
[02:47:46.280 --> 02:47:50.280]  suggesting countries should follow china's lead
[02:47:50.280 --> 02:47:54.280]  in instituting a one-child policy to reduce global population over time
[02:47:54.280 --> 02:47:58.280]  he added that fertility rights could be sold so that poor people
[02:47:58.280 --> 02:48:02.280]  could profit from their decision not to reproduce this is eugenics 110%
[02:48:02.280 --> 02:48:06.280]  the secret behind ted turners call for western nations
[02:48:06.280 --> 02:48:10.280]  to enforce a tyrannical policy that in the china is administered by
[02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:14.280]  undercover police and family planning authorities who our own government set up
[02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:18.280]  who kidnapped forced drug and then forcibly abort babies of pregnant women has nothing
[02:48:18.280 --> 02:48:22.280]  but so ever to do with his concern for the environment
[02:48:22.280 --> 02:48:26.280]  turner himself has five children who knows no less than two million acres of land
[02:48:26.280 --> 02:48:30.280]  he is the largest private landowner on the planet see he just hates you folks
[02:48:30.280 --> 02:48:34.280]  he's a control freak he's a oh he's such a slime bag
[02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:38.280]  and his money's tax free he didn't spend about what a great philanthropist he is
[02:48:38.280 --> 02:48:42.280]  falling short of only the royal families of europe
[02:48:42.280 --> 02:48:46.280]  turner has publicly advocated shocking population reduction programs that would
[02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:50.280]  have staggering 95% on record these are links to his statements
[02:48:50.280 --> 02:48:54.280]  a figure only achievable by outright genocide mass abortion and fantasy
[02:48:54.280 --> 02:48:58.280]  but if they tell you to fight al qaeda they average you up you'll blow their head off
[02:48:58.280 --> 02:49:02.280]  you know right in front of a walmart scanner they'll just be like oh god i love you Ted turner
[02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:06.280]  it's just you know it's so great
[02:49:06.280 --> 02:49:10.280]  the third world turner has contributed literally billions to population reduction
[02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:14.280]  namely through the united nations program leading the way for the likes of bill
[02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:18.280]  melinda gates and warren buffett gates fathers long been a leading board member of
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:22.280]  plant parenthood and atop the genesis gates himself has given speeches in which
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:26.280]  he promotes the use of vaccines and abortion as a means of
[02:49:26.280 --> 02:49:30.280]  reducing global population and lowering co2 emissions
[02:49:30.280 --> 02:49:34.280]  it's us or them folks you got to get this article out to everybody you got to get aggressive
[02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:38.280]  quite how an improvement in health care
[02:49:38.280 --> 02:49:42.280]  through vaccines that supposedly save lives would lead to lowering the global
[02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:46.280]  population is an oxymoron unless gates was referring to vaccines that sterilize
[02:49:46.280 --> 02:49:50.280]  people as you have been caught doing which is precisely the same method advocated by
[02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:54.280]  why how science are john b. holdren linked to his statements which calls for dictatorial
[02:49:54.280 --> 02:49:58.280]  planetary regime to enforce your conan measures for population reduction
[02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:02.280]  the old manner of oppressive techniques including sterilization and they already put
[02:50:02.280 --> 02:50:06.280]  radioactive isotopes that sterilize you and fluoride in the water and how many more
[02:50:06.280 --> 02:50:10.280]  medical doctors they got to have on and the government even knows it's true but the average

[02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:04.280]  it just makes me sick because every link I've already read the link up years ago
[02:55:04.280 --> 02:55:08.280]  I'm already know all this frontwards and backwards and most people listening probably don't even care enough
[02:55:08.280 --> 02:55:12.280]  to get the article and send it out to people that there's an organized mass murder soft kill campaign

[02:55:28.280 --> 02:55:32.280]  these are murderers we're dealing with bunch of smiley face murderers
[02:55:32.280 --> 02:55:36.280]  who treat us like children we're supposed to go along with them into their high tech
[02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:40.280]  21st century death camps I'm not going to be part of it
[02:55:40.280 --> 02:55:44.280]  and I commit myself body soul 110% against
[02:55:44.280 --> 02:55:48.280]  you globalist the good news is you're still you
[02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:52.280]  you're still ugly your souls are ugly you're cowardly you're a bunch
[02:55:52.280 --> 02:55:56.280]  of wicked control freak trash you're miserable and your
[02:55:56.280 --> 02:56:00.280]  high tech systems are going to keep you alive forever you think you're invincible you think you're
[02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:04.280]  going to mold society God God is not
[02:56:04.280 --> 02:56:08.280]  a sadist like you believe and you're not God and you're going to fail
[02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:12.280]  the truth is your humanities test and humanity is going to pass
[02:56:12.280 --> 02:56:16.280]  the test by defeating you
[02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:20.280]  this is what
[02:56:20.280 --> 02:56:24.280]  and it goes on to say White House Science advisor John P. Holdren's
[02:56:24.280 --> 02:56:28.280]  plan to sterilize to the water this is what Gates Turner discussed when they met in secret
[02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:32.280]  with the likes of George Sorrells and David Rockefeller to private gathering of billionaires in Manhattan
[02:56:32.280 --> 02:56:36.280]  linked to mainstream news last year a confab focused around how these globalists
[02:56:36.280 --> 02:56:40.280]  could use their wealth to slow the growth of the world population by cutting off your carbon
[02:56:40.280 --> 02:56:44.280]  man they're evil
[02:56:44.280 --> 02:56:48.280]  oh you don't have a job because of globalism sterilization
[02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:52.280]  10 grand
[02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:56.280]  as is manifestly provable the true agenda behind fanning the flames and fears
[02:56:56.280 --> 02:57:00.280]  overpopulation has reduced living standards globally by
[02:57:00.280 --> 02:57:04.280]  preventing the third world from ever becoming economically prosperous which would lower their
[02:57:04.280 --> 02:57:08.280]  population while also eviscerating the middle class of western nations
[02:57:08.280 --> 02:57:12.280]  see if you go back to 49 the world commission on population they said we're going to let the third
[02:57:12.280 --> 02:57:16.280]  world explode by not industrializing then we're going to use them as a weapon to
[02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:20.280]  deindustrialize the west then we're going to soft kill all of them and you know
[02:57:20.280 --> 02:57:24.280]  what the king of England said how Hitler just like
[02:57:24.280 --> 02:57:28.280]  his brother had you had to advocate because of his Nazi activities
[02:57:28.280 --> 02:57:32.280]  there's a lot bigger than the Nazis folks as is manifestly provable
[02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:36.280]  the true agenda behind this is to cut living standards worldwide
[02:57:36.280 --> 02:57:40.280]  by preventing the third world from ever becoming economically prosperous while
[02:57:40.280 --> 02:57:44.280]  eviscerating the middle class of western nations it has nothing whatsoever to do with the earth
[02:57:44.280 --> 02:57:48.280]  and it's merely another convenient trojan horse the globalists invoke
[02:57:48.280 --> 02:57:52.280]  to advance their tyranny this fact was admitted in the leaked un blueprint
[02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:56.280]  which emerged in september the document called for alarmist to push over population
[02:57:56.280 --> 02:58:00.280]  now they're being honest about what they want as a replacement for climate change
[02:58:00.280 --> 02:58:04.280]  while conducting that the ultimate goal and conceding
[02:58:04.280 --> 02:58:08.280]  to limit and redirect the aspirations for a better life of rising
[02:58:08.280 --> 02:58:12.280]  middle classes around the world you hear that teaching you to hate yourself
[02:58:12.280 --> 02:58:16.280]  teaching you to not have a survival instinct well I got a strong one
[02:58:16.280 --> 02:58:20.280]  and I recognize a bunch of devils when I see them
[02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:24.280]  in other words to convince the masses that they will have to be content
[02:58:24.280 --> 02:58:28.280]  with a state of near poverty in order to save the planet from Armageddon
[02:58:28.280 --> 02:58:32.280]  then once your poor sterilization and it just goes on the article so key
[02:58:32.280 --> 02:58:36.280]  great job by Watson it's up at prisonplanet.com the secret behind Ted Turner's
[02:58:36.280 --> 02:58:40.280]  call for a global one-child policy retradition is coming up with Bob Bar right now
[02:58:40.280 --> 02:59:04.280]  stay with us
