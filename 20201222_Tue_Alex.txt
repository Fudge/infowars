[00:00.000 --> 00:21.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this Tuesday, December 22nd.
[00:21.760 --> 00:31.440]  The year is 2020 as we are hurtling to the year 2021.
[00:31.440 --> 00:40.320]  And finally, the conclusion of the 2020 presidential election, which saw a landslide victory for
[00:40.320 --> 00:47.440]  President Donald J. Trump, only to be stolen in the dead of night by the kleptocrat globalist
[00:47.440 --> 00:58.160]  Democrat Chai Kham, congruency of criminal activity. And we've got all of that news coming up.
[00:58.160 --> 01:05.440]  We've got breaking COVID news. I'm going to lay out this stimulus bill that I hope will
[01:05.440 --> 01:11.920]  be vetoed by the president, because this is ridiculous. You want to talk about a slap in
[01:11.920 --> 01:20.480]  the face? This is the slap in the face, but with a like, it's like they just farted in their hand
[01:20.480 --> 01:25.280]  and then like wafted it into your mouth. I mean, I'm sorry to be gross. That's how offensive
[01:25.280 --> 01:29.680]  this stimulus bill is. So we've got the details of that coming up as well.
[01:32.560 --> 01:40.240]  And of course, with 28 days left to stop the end of the Republic, as we know it,
[01:40.240 --> 01:46.960]  if Joe Biden gets into the White House, we're going to have attorney Robert Barnes joining
[01:46.960 --> 01:51.600]  me to discuss this. Nick Fuentes joining me to discuss this. But first, before I do that,
[01:52.720 --> 01:58.640]  you know, we are living in a sci-fi, dystopian movie. Sometimes you wonder if you're going to
[01:58.640 --> 02:04.320]  wake up from this nightmare. But no, we are here. We are in it. And so let's go into suspended
[02:04.320 --> 02:12.400]  reality and just try to enjoy this for whatever it's worth to pricks getting the prick. And of
[02:12.400 --> 02:16.960]  course that's Joe Biden and Anthony Fauci. Guys, if you just want to roll the b-roll, I don't care
[02:16.960 --> 02:22.720]  whether you roll Joe or Fauci, whoever it is. And it's just hilarious to watch this.
[02:24.080 --> 02:31.440]  Complete big pharma stooges, complete sellouts, complete frauds, complete phonies telling us
[02:31.440 --> 02:38.960]  nothing to worry about. Get the vaccine. You'll be fine. Well, why are you telling me that?
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.680]  Why are you trying to convince me so much that this vaccine will be fine? And I'm noticing
[02:45.680 --> 02:53.280]  another thing now that I'm watching this. Each vaccine that I've seen administered here
[02:54.960 --> 02:58.240]  on camera, whether it's Biden or Fauci or some other numb nuts,
[02:58.240 --> 03:03.520]  it always is a different amount. Biden just had a very small amount there. So that's a
[03:03.520 --> 03:09.760]  little strange to me. I guess what I should say is I'm not buying it. I'm not buying Joe Biden
[03:09.760 --> 03:14.480]  actually got a COVID vaccine. Guys, real Fauci getting it too. I'm not buying that Fauci actually
[03:14.480 --> 03:20.720]  got a COVID vaccine. They probably got something else like a B12 shot because they're not getting
[03:20.720 --> 03:29.600]  an RNA shot, folks. And I saw an actual, I guess it was a biologist or whatever,
[03:30.400 --> 03:37.520]  breakdown what the RNA shot does. And it's everything that we told you.
[03:40.320 --> 03:48.400]  Now, they know this is an experimental vax. Look at that chicken neck. Look at that sleeve.
[03:48.400 --> 03:52.480]  Look at that string hanging out of his arm. Oh, that is his arm.
[03:54.720 --> 03:59.920]  I mean, let's see what Fauci's little little shot here looks like. Maybe he doesn't even get it.
[04:00.640 --> 04:07.680]  I haven't seen this one. Oh, the vaccine is so great. Let me just convince you how great it is.
[04:09.280 --> 04:14.640]  Let's see here. Oh, you can't really see how much is in that one. Boy, that one stayed in there a
[04:14.640 --> 04:26.320]  while, didn't it? Oh, yeah. Yeah, Fauci. Get that vaccine. Get that RNA vaccine, Fauci.
[04:27.440 --> 04:34.880]  Bring in your medical tyranny. So no, you did not just get the RNA vaccine that you want to give
[04:34.880 --> 04:41.120]  us any we would just stands up and runs away. I'm not buying it. Now maybe they did maybe they
[04:41.120 --> 04:47.600]  didn't. But folks, they're now coming out and telling you this is going to be a mandatory vaccine,
[04:47.600 --> 04:52.720]  even though Fauci says the lockdowns have to continue and there's already a new strain here.
[04:52.720 --> 05:19.440]  So the COVID vaccine is already irrelevant, folks. It's already irrelevant.
[05:23.120 --> 05:28.400]  We have thousands of products made right here in America with our warehouses and our crew.
[05:28.400 --> 05:33.040]  It's incredible and it changes the whole world. So do your shopping. If you want to fund the
[05:33.040 --> 05:37.680]  info or if you want to stop the globalist and info or store.com and tell others do their shopping
[05:37.680 --> 05:42.320]  and info or store.com. We have amazing products. We can get everything delivered to you by Christmas
[05:42.320 --> 05:46.800]  if you order by the 18th. So again, I want to thank you all for your support. I want to thank
[05:46.800 --> 05:50.640]  you for thinking through what you do and where you spend your money and do your shopping and get
[05:50.640 --> 06:12.400]  great products at info or store.com. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones show and
[06:12.400 --> 06:18.640]  there's Anthony Fauci getting a shot. Isn't that nice and domestic? It's Alex Jones. Thank you,
[06:18.640 --> 06:26.000]  Fauci. And now your host, Owen Troyer. Yes. Oh, Dr. Fauci, we love you. You're a hero. Ha.
[06:28.000 --> 06:35.840]  There's Fauci, a guy who hasn't done any actual medical practice, maybe in his whole life,
[06:36.560 --> 06:41.440]  but he'll tell you to get the vaccine and oh, he's lined up too. And I love how they have these
[06:41.440 --> 06:47.280]  nurses out here. Everybody's wearing a mask and they have the face shields. It's all a big joke.
[06:47.280 --> 06:52.320]  It's all a big ruse. And we're just along for the ride. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex
[06:52.320 --> 06:57.600]  Jones show. It is Tuesday, December 22nd. The year is 2020. Owen Troyer sitting in for Alex today.
[06:58.240 --> 07:06.320]  Great guests coming up. Robert Barnes in 30 minutes. Nick Fuentes in an hour and 30 minutes.
[07:06.320 --> 07:11.360]  Paul Joseph Watson hosting the fourth hour. I'm going to squeeze in phone calls today as well.
[07:11.360 --> 07:16.080]  If I can't get the phone calls today on this broadcast because I have a ton of news,
[07:16.080 --> 07:21.920]  I will dedicate the War Room, which I'll also be hosting today, to your phone call. So we will be
[07:21.920 --> 07:26.080]  taking your phone calls, whether it's in the next three hours or from three to six p.m. when I'm
[07:26.080 --> 07:35.680]  hosting the War Room. What we're going to get to today, I mean, how do you even do proper analysis
[07:35.680 --> 07:45.600]  of this? You have a fake pandemic and now you have a experimental vaccine where the vaccine
[07:45.600 --> 07:54.560]  manufacturers are immune from, no pun intended, immune from any legal liability, any lawsuits.
[07:54.560 --> 08:01.040]  How could we possibly allow that? Well, if that isn't absurd enough, which there's actually more
[08:01.040 --> 08:08.560]  absurdities to go along with that, now vaccine IDs and also the fact that they're claiming there's
[08:08.560 --> 08:16.240]  new strains of COVID. So the vaccine that they just had warp speed to give you is already irrelevant.
[08:16.240 --> 08:20.960]  It already is irrelevant. We've got new strains of COVID. So the vaccine doesn't even do anything,
[08:22.080 --> 08:29.360]  except it's an experimental vaccine with the messenger RNA to go rewrite your human genome.
[08:29.360 --> 08:36.640]  Very loving, very loving. And the scientists who see people talking about this, they go break it
[08:36.640 --> 08:41.840]  down and they're like, yeah, this is the new RNA vaccine. It's new nanotech. It's new biotech.
[08:41.840 --> 08:48.240]  It goes and rewrites your thing. It's cool. It's trendy. Sweet. So is a sledgehammer to your
[08:48.240 --> 08:56.800]  Johnson. It rewrites your reproductive system. Take a sledgehammer to your Wee Wee and you'll
[08:56.800 --> 09:00.400]  have a new reproductive system. And that's basically what they're saying. Oh, you get the
[09:00.400 --> 09:09.920]  messenger RNA and it rewrites your human genome. Isn't it great? And the next thing you know,
[09:09.920 --> 09:18.800]  Gallagher is going to step up and take a sledgehammer to your male member.
[09:20.240 --> 09:27.280]  But it's rewriting you. It's a good thing. You're welcome. You know, you just pass out, die, get
[09:27.280 --> 09:36.880]  bells palsy. Oh, can I sue the vaccine menu? No. No, you just have to shut up and die.
[09:38.400 --> 09:42.560]  You're welcome. Yeah, of course, Elmo wants to sell you the vaccine
[09:44.800 --> 09:52.960]  because it's just so trendy. This is unbelievable. The good news is
[09:52.960 --> 09:58.320]  the globalists, the corrupt globalists have completely revealed themselves. Their agenda's
[09:58.320 --> 10:02.000]  been completely revealed. And now it's just a matter of, are they going to get away with it?
[10:02.880 --> 10:09.520]  Whether it's the election theft or this experimental RNA vaccine that doesn't even stop COVID.
[10:10.480 --> 10:13.920]  Think about that. They're claiming you have to get two or three shots because this thing may not
[10:13.920 --> 10:18.320]  even stop COVID. And they tell you, yeah, you're going to get the vaccine and you're probably
[10:18.320 --> 10:23.760]  going to go numb for a little bit. You may faint or pass out. You may experience some death or death
[10:23.760 --> 10:30.320]  like symptoms, but it's okay. You're doing it for the greater good, which of course is
[10:31.040 --> 10:39.440]  the entire notion behind communism. As if that's not offensive enough, they're going to be
[10:39.440 --> 10:49.840]  mandating this starting next year. And so they're announcing that. It doesn't matter that the vaccine
[10:49.840 --> 10:59.440]  is already relevant. And then you have perhaps the greatest affront to your existence as an American
[10:59.440 --> 11:09.840]  citizen. The stimulus bill that I'm hoping the president will veto. I do believe he still has
[11:09.840 --> 11:15.920]  the ability to veto this. This is out of control, folks. I mean, it's nothing new.
[11:17.600 --> 11:21.040]  But again, it's just getting away with murder right in front of your face.
[11:21.040 --> 11:29.600]  So we'll be looking at that. We'll be looking at President Trump's
[11:29.600 --> 11:34.000]  Trump's potential path to victory coming up in the next 28 days with Bob Barnes,
[11:34.640 --> 11:44.000]  as well as some developing news on that. So we're going to break all of this down
[11:44.880 --> 11:49.440]  in the next three hours, or I will be before Paul Joseph Watson hosts the fourth hour,
[11:49.440 --> 11:54.240]  and then I'll be back hosting the War Room. If we don't get the calls during the Alex Jones show,
[11:54.240 --> 11:59.840]  we will dedicate that entire broadcast to your calls. Before I do that, though,
[12:02.560 --> 12:08.160]  you know, 2020 has been an interesting year. And at the end of every year, you have to do your
[12:08.160 --> 12:18.960]  financials. And basically, you've seen what we've been able to do in 2020. And we'd like to have
[12:18.960 --> 12:30.800]  the same capacity and the same mobility in 2021 as we did in 2020. Obviously, things are difficult
[12:30.800 --> 12:35.920]  around here when you have to build your own infrastructure. That is not cheap. A lot of
[12:35.920 --> 12:43.280]  people don't fully understand or quite frankly, respect how much money it takes just to get this
[12:43.280 --> 12:52.480]  place running every day. And you built this ship and you fueled this ship by shopping at
[12:52.480 --> 13:00.560]  InfowarsStore.com. Infowars wants to be here through 2021 and beyond. Hell, we'd like to be here
[13:00.560 --> 13:05.920]  for infinity, but that takes all of us. The good news is we've got new specials right now
[13:05.920 --> 13:11.360]  at InfowarsStore.com, the New Year's Resolution Energize Pack, featuring vitamin B12,
[13:11.360 --> 13:18.080]  supermal vitality, turbo force, the New Year's Revitalize Pack, the New Year's Revitalize and
[13:18.080 --> 13:23.760]  Energize Pack. It's all there on the screen right there. But people are really excited
[13:25.360 --> 13:34.160]  and rightfully so that we have vitamin D supplement, winter sun plus back in stock.
[13:34.160 --> 13:44.640]  Now, we've been selling you winter sun vitamin D for a long time at InfowarsStore.com because
[13:45.600 --> 13:49.840]  this is well before COVID. This was years ago. We knew how important vitamin D was,
[13:49.840 --> 13:53.440]  specifically during the winter. That's why it's called winter sun plus. You're not getting as
[13:53.440 --> 13:59.520]  much vitamin D in the winter. That's why people are more susceptible to a flu or any sort of illness
[13:59.520 --> 14:04.240]  and your immune system is weakened. You're not getting the sun. You're not getting the vitamin D.
[14:04.240 --> 14:09.680]  So we came out with winter sun, now winter sun plus, the advanced formula to get you the best
[14:09.680 --> 14:20.240]  vitamin D supplement on the market. Now, we sold out of winter sun plus as soon as people realized
[14:20.240 --> 14:24.720]  how important vitamin D was, and then they made the connection, whether they were actually afraid
[14:24.720 --> 14:30.320]  of COVID or they were just hearing this in the background, about how 90% or I think it's 80%
[14:30.320 --> 14:37.120]  of the COVID deaths, they're deficient in vitamin D. And then after eight months of denying vitamin
[14:37.120 --> 14:41.840]  D help, Fauci actually came out and said, no, you do need vitamin D. That's scoundrel. Well,
[14:41.840 --> 14:46.480]  we knew that all along. That's why we sold winter sun plus. Now, it was sold out because we had a
[14:46.480 --> 14:54.800]  run of it. It is back in stock. And let me tell you, this is a good thing. But it is selling out
[14:54.800 --> 15:00.320]  fast for good reason. So it's a good thing because we're funding the broadcast, but we have it 50%
[15:00.320 --> 15:06.480]  off. So we have to sell every single one of these really to make any money. I mean, we could sell
[15:06.480 --> 15:11.040]  this at full price, folks. I mean, at the rate it's selling, most people would say, don't put 50%
[15:11.040 --> 15:15.440]  off on that. That's ridiculous. You can sell this. In fact, probably double the price. We don't do
[15:15.440 --> 15:20.960]  that. We cut the price in half because we want you to have the supplement. And our formula is
[15:20.960 --> 15:28.160]  sell as much as possible, even if it's at small margins to fund ourselves. So sell as much product
[15:28.160 --> 15:34.000]  as much as possible at the lowest price, the best products. And that's how we fund ourselves.
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.720]  Winter sun plus is the perfect example. So get your winter sun plus. Also, this is just because
[15:38.720 --> 15:44.800]  I saw this before we came in today. Just to see what's going on. Not only is winter sun plus
[15:44.800 --> 15:51.840]  selling out fast, DNA force plus is also selling out fast. It's also 50% off now. I only got six
[15:51.840 --> 15:55.440]  seconds. I can't tell you about all the benefits of DNA force plus, but that is the real deal.
[15:55.440 --> 16:00.560]  That is an elite supplement at info or store.com globalists are taking control of the entire human
[16:00.560 --> 16:08.480]  genome. They are forcing mutations. This is forced evolution or de evolution. When you look at all
[16:08.480 --> 16:13.040]  the major research, all the major programs are carrying out. They are not to produce people
[16:13.040 --> 16:19.520]  that are smarter or folks that live longer or more moral. No, it's turning humanity into a commodity.
[16:19.520 --> 16:24.800]  Now we see some propaganda like communist China bragging. Hey, we've done mRNA vaccines to make
[16:24.800 --> 16:30.480]  our soldiers Superman. That's a way to make it sexy that hey, we're experimenting on our troops.
[16:30.960 --> 16:35.120]  We'll send things with that into our troops and thousands and thousands of died each time they
[16:35.120 --> 16:40.320]  tried a new experimental vaccine. I've talked to high level folks inside the federal government
[16:40.320 --> 16:44.080]  and the state of Texas health department. They say Alex, we know it hurts a lot of people
[16:44.080 --> 16:48.560]  that's for a greater good, but that's not even true. And it violates the Geneva Convention,
[16:48.560 --> 16:53.440]  the Nuremberg Code, federal state law. This is violence being carried out against us by that
[16:53.440 --> 17:00.640]  as a charity and we have a right to resist it with any means necessary. The year 2021 is almost
[17:00.640 --> 17:06.160]  here. And so we're launching our new year's specials right now. We've got two different big
[17:06.160 --> 17:11.120]  sales. We've got Super Bowl Vitality, Turbo Force and Ultra 12. Part of the New Year's resolution
[17:11.120 --> 17:16.640]  energized pack 40% off. We've got bodies, vaso beats and knockout. Part of the New Year's
[17:16.640 --> 17:22.320]  resolution revitalized pack at 40% off. But if you get both of these packs together,
[17:22.320 --> 17:28.480]  they are 60% off with free shipping and double patriot points. The best deal ever. I want to
[17:28.480 --> 17:33.200]  thank you all for your support and encourage you to go to infowarstore.com today and take advantage
[17:33.200 --> 17:37.840]  of this and you can't lose because it funds the info war. Again, get the great products info
[17:37.840 --> 17:42.560]  war store.com and fund the second American Revolution worldwide at a time that it's more
[17:42.560 --> 17:49.040]  critical than ever. Again, the year 2021 is here and I am committed to you to fight against the
[17:49.040 --> 17:53.520]  globalist harder than ever. So thank you so much for keeping info wars in the fight without your
[17:53.520 --> 18:03.920]  support. We couldn't do any on it. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:10.320 --> 18:16.800]  We now take you live to the central Texas commence ever and the heart of the resistance.
[18:16.800 --> 18:22.080]  And now your host, Owen Troyer. All right, ladies and gentlemen, I've got the latest
[18:22.080 --> 18:27.200]  COVID news coming up election news coming up. I want to get into the absolute
[18:30.240 --> 18:33.280]  I mean, I don't even have the word for it. It's beyond offensive.
[18:34.160 --> 18:38.800]  This stimulus bill that they're they're they're claiming is so great for us. I'm going to get
[18:38.800 --> 18:44.160]  into that in a second. But you know, I'm going over my news. I'm looking at the
[18:44.960 --> 18:48.320]  medical tyranny that's coming in 2021. They're going to they're going to they're
[18:48.320 --> 18:53.280]  claiming they're going to force you to have a vaccine ID coming up. So I'm going to explain
[18:53.280 --> 19:00.320]  that. And you know, I'm just as frustrated with President Trump as anybody else right now.
[19:01.360 --> 19:05.280]  I don't see President Trump leading from the front instead trying to lead from behind.
[19:06.320 --> 19:12.960]  That's a losing approach. Now, having said that, President Trump is yet to make his final move.
[19:12.960 --> 19:24.000]  So this is a man who is not going to go away quietly. And it's a man who likes making the last
[19:24.000 --> 19:31.840]  move. So what is President Trump's final move? When will we see it? Perhaps we'll address that
[19:32.480 --> 19:37.440]  when we open up the phone lines. The frustrating thing is
[19:37.440 --> 19:48.400]  is Trump is just the captain of a team. And everyone else on the team is against him.
[19:50.480 --> 19:57.280]  There's an old baseball story called Eight Men Out, where the Chicago Black Sox, I forget what
[19:57.280 --> 20:04.560]  it's like 1912 or something, but the Chicago Black Sox with Shoeless Joe Jackson, he was the only
[20:04.560 --> 20:08.240]  guy on the team that wanted to win the World Series. The rest were bought off and paid for by
[20:08.240 --> 20:14.160]  the Chicago Mafia. So they threw the World Series. Now, Joe Jackson in that World Series
[20:14.160 --> 20:18.160]  batted like, you know, he had an incredible series. He was hitting home runs and triples and stealing
[20:18.160 --> 20:21.920]  bases and runs and everything. Everyone else on the team laid down, they took the money
[20:22.640 --> 20:30.000]  from the Chicago Mafia. So that's the situation Trump is in right now. He's one man on the team
[20:30.000 --> 20:35.440]  trying to win. Everyone else has been bought off and paid for whether it's the Chinese Communist,
[20:35.440 --> 20:40.480]  blackmailed by a pedophile network or actually into that crap, whatever it is. They're the Eight
[20:40.480 --> 20:45.040]  Men Out. They're out. They don't want victory for America. They're not playing for victory for America.
[20:45.040 --> 20:50.000]  They're bought, they're blackmailed, they're done. So Trump's out there still giving it his all,
[20:51.440 --> 20:55.840]  but the whole team is against him. And the whole team is against the team itself.
[20:55.840 --> 21:03.920]  So when I see this, when they announced, oh, 2021, the mandatory vaccine idea is coming, I'm like,
[21:03.920 --> 21:06.480]  hey, President Trump, can you make a statement and shut this down?
[21:08.880 --> 21:13.840]  But he's not even running that play. He's over here trying to run these plays and it's just,
[21:14.560 --> 21:18.720]  it's just ridiculous, the amount of sabotage that goes on. But that's where we're at. Now,
[21:18.720 --> 21:27.760]  they do this to us. Well, hell, I mean, they do this to us every time they pass some sort of
[21:27.760 --> 21:34.720]  a stimulus bill. But this is perhaps the most offensive thing I've ever seen. This stimulus bill,
[21:35.680 --> 21:43.680]  and pardon me for being graphic, I like being accurate in my analogies here. So excuse me for
[21:43.680 --> 21:51.360]  being graphic, but this is just the analogy. What has been given to us with this stimulus bill
[21:52.480 --> 21:59.520]  is like if the head chef of a restaurant comes up to you with a rotting old dog turd on a plate
[22:00.320 --> 22:06.800]  and then urinates on it in front of you and says, this is filet mignon with Bernays sauce.
[22:07.760 --> 22:12.320]  And you're like, no, that's a rotting moldy dog turd. And you just urinated on it in front of
[22:12.320 --> 22:18.320]  me. He says, no, that's a filet mignon medium rare. Look at that. And it's just, you know,
[22:19.040 --> 22:23.840]  so they're celebrating like this check is good thing. Now, not everybody,
[22:25.360 --> 22:28.880]  but anybody who's claiming that this stimulus bill is a good thing is,
[22:30.000 --> 22:35.680]  I mean, do we just, how do you even respond to this? It's so offensive. So let me go into this
[22:35.680 --> 22:42.800]  story at national file. Pelosi calls $600 stimulus significant, but said $1,000 employee
[22:42.800 --> 22:47.520]  bonuses following Trump tax cuts were crumbs. Well, yeah, Nancy Pelosi is a lying bitch
[22:48.080 --> 22:54.400]  and a fraud. So I wouldn't be surprised by that at all. 600 bucks for you. Here's an idea. Open up
[22:54.400 --> 22:59.360]  the economy. No, they can't have that. So you're a slave now. You need the government. That's what
[22:59.360 --> 23:08.480]  they want. Here are some, and I'm just going to go through some of this $300 million for migrant
[23:08.480 --> 23:16.560]  and refugee assistance. How does that help you? It doesn't $10,000 per person for student loan
[23:16.560 --> 23:20.960]  bailout. How does that help you? Well, if you have a student loan, it might otherwise it doesn't
[23:20.960 --> 23:30.320]  $100 million to NASA. How does that benefit you? Probably won't $20 billion to the United
[23:30.320 --> 23:33.920]  States Postal Service, which just helped steal our election. So that's nice.
[23:37.040 --> 23:43.200]  $300 million to the endowment of the arts. That won't help you at all. You can't even go enjoy
[23:43.200 --> 23:46.400]  these things. You can't go to the theater. So that, so they're, so they're giving hundreds of
[23:46.400 --> 23:51.920]  millions of dollars to things that are closed. $300 million for the endowment for the humanities.
[23:51.920 --> 23:58.160]  You never even heard of this. You never even heard of this. $435 million for mental health
[23:58.160 --> 24:03.040]  support. Well, hopefully that'll be going directly to the Democrats, but not in the way it needs to.
[24:05.040 --> 24:10.560]  $30 billion for the Department of Education Stabilization Fund. So they shut down the schools,
[24:10.560 --> 24:14.880]  they stop bringing in the revenue, they have to pay the teachers, and then they just say,
[24:14.880 --> 24:20.800]  oh, we're just going to bail it out. So all these problems caused by politicians we have to pay for,
[24:20.800 --> 24:26.560]  and then they say, oh, thank us. Another $35 million to the JFK Center for Performing Arts.
[24:29.520 --> 24:35.600]  The House of Representatives got a raise $25 million for additional salary for the House of
[24:35.600 --> 24:42.640]  Representatives. Oh, yes, that's why AOC, that fraud complained about the bill all day long
[24:42.640 --> 24:46.480]  yesterday. AOC was complaining about the bill. You know what she did? She approved it.
[24:48.960 --> 24:54.560]  Yeah, that's right. Well, when she saw she was getting a raise, I mean, you know,
[24:55.200 --> 25:02.480]  she's a good capitalist. Don't be confused by AOC's politics. She is a money-grubbing political whore.
[25:05.280 --> 25:09.680]  $25 million to clean the Capitol building. Boy, I'll tell you, they could actually use that in
[25:09.680 --> 25:15.120]  the central block of the Metro DC jail. I can tell you that from experience. As far as the Capitol
[25:15.120 --> 25:20.560]  building is concerned, I don't think so. But that'll probably get put right back into the politicians
[25:20.560 --> 25:26.880]  hands somehow. Seven and a half million to the Smithsonian. So they get a raise if you work at
[25:26.880 --> 25:33.680]  the Smithsonian. That's nice. That's good. $90 million for the Peace Corps. Oh, we just randomly
[25:33.680 --> 25:39.440]  are giving $13 million to Howard University. Oh, that's nice. That's good. And by the way,
[25:39.440 --> 25:45.680]  this benefits you how? A billion dollars to the airline's recycle and save program?
[25:51.120 --> 25:57.840]  They signed this thing, man. They signed this thing. Two and a half million dollars for public
[25:57.840 --> 26:07.760]  and Indian housing. That's nice. That's nice. Story at info wars.com headline. Billions going
[26:07.760 --> 26:15.520]  to foreign aid and spending bill. Gender programs in Pakistan. Sri Lankan ship refurbishments. Wow.
[26:17.360 --> 26:24.240]  Globalist COVID stimulus package sends billions of dollars to the Gates Foundation as well.
[26:24.240 --> 26:33.280]  Isn't that just so nice? And I've got all of it. That's not even half of the most ridiculous stuff
[26:33.280 --> 26:38.960]  of it, folks. I mean, literally, it's like most of this, most of the stimulus bill is going to foreign
[26:40.000 --> 26:46.880]  causes, foreign countries. Okay. So we'll continue to highlight this as the show goes on. We're going
[26:46.880 --> 26:53.040]  to be joined on the other side by Robert Barnes. But this stimulus bill is the politicians of our
[26:53.040 --> 26:59.040]  country. Kissing in our face. How rude. That's true. Dictionary has a very simple definition
[26:59.040 --> 27:05.360]  of terrorism. Other dictionaries have similar ones. Terrorism is the threat of force or actually
[27:05.360 --> 27:12.160]  carrying out force for a political or financial reason. It's basically scaring the hell out of
[27:12.160 --> 27:17.840]  people until you submit to them. That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[27:17.840 --> 27:22.720]  Do you see the headlines from CNN? Have you seen those doctors say it's worse than they ever thought?
[27:22.720 --> 27:29.040]  COVID, more dumbest things they could ever imagine. They told us that two and a half million people would be dead
[27:29.040 --> 27:35.280]  just eight months ago, within three months. Okay. It's a quarter million. If you count all of the
[27:35.280 --> 27:40.480]  people that died of other things, we're talking 96% had comorbidity. These are real numbers. These are
[27:40.480 --> 27:45.680]  real facts. This is the chicken little event. We all run our houses, never come out and are taught
[27:45.680 --> 27:50.160]  we're not essential. All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet. Rebuke it,
[27:50.160 --> 27:55.360]  stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you could put up with and survive.
[27:56.800 --> 28:02.400]  The Post Industrial World. That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the
[28:03.200 --> 28:12.080]  Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992. Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post
[28:12.080 --> 28:16.480]  industrial world plowswap of the Davos group. Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, their
[28:16.480 --> 28:23.600]  all on record saying the great reset is Agenda 2030. Well, you might want to find out what Agenda
[28:23.600 --> 28:29.840]  2030 is. It is the destruction of society as we know it. It is making the population more
[28:29.840 --> 28:36.000]  by designs. We can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family. They're
[28:36.000 --> 28:44.160]  destroying civilization, rebuild it in their dystopic image. We are fighting this at info wars.com
[28:44.160 --> 28:49.600]  and newswords.com. We are fighting for a pro human future and we need you to get the facts,
[28:49.600 --> 28:53.840]  to research it and share it with others and join the fight. God bless you. Visit us,
[28:53.840 --> 29:00.160]  spread the word at infowars.com. Let's go to Juan in Connecticut. You're on the air. Thanks for
[29:00.160 --> 29:04.160]  holding. Hello. Can you hear me? I sure can, sir. Thank you. Hey, Alex. Before I start, man,
[29:04.160 --> 29:09.920]  I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now. It's an honor
[29:09.920 --> 29:17.840]  to talk to you, brother. I just want to plug in. I'm a truck driver and two before have changed
[29:17.840 --> 29:24.640]  the way I drive. Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us. We are Hispanics, Cubans,
[29:24.640 --> 29:31.600]  Puerto Ricans. We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rola and I have lost weight because I
[29:31.600 --> 29:35.680]  stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you for that, man. Well, brother, we put
[29:35.680 --> 29:41.120]  more in this than any other long term, high quality energy powder there is. So this was
[29:41.120 --> 29:44.240]  designed on one of the top guys in the country. He didn't want his name on it because obviously
[29:44.240 --> 29:47.520]  the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design
[29:47.520 --> 29:52.240]  of it. And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there. And you're
[29:52.240 --> 29:55.280]  saying that it's made your life better. So that means a lot to me. Thank you to all your truck
[29:55.280 --> 30:06.240]  drivers. We love you. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:25.440 --> 30:34.000]  Back here live in the Info Wars world headquarters in Austin, Texas. Owen Schreuer sitting in here
[30:35.680 --> 30:42.000]  on the Alex Jones show. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas from all of us here at Info Wars to you
[30:42.000 --> 30:51.600]  tuned in today and Merry Christmas to Robert Barnes, who is joining me now from his humble abode
[30:51.600 --> 30:59.600]  where lots of legal thought and analysis goes down. And so he joins me now to discuss the
[31:00.240 --> 31:06.880]  presidential election. Robert, everybody seems focused on January 6th right now,
[31:06.880 --> 31:12.960]  including the president of the United States, your take on where we're at right now,
[31:12.960 --> 31:17.760]  and how confident are you that January 6th is the day to be watching?
[31:17.760 --> 31:25.680]  It definitely is. I mean, ultimately the constitutional remedy for a presidential
[31:25.680 --> 31:30.480]  election that goes AWOL was always intended to be Congress, more so than the courts,
[31:30.480 --> 31:35.920]  more so than the state legislatures. That's why the Congress decides whether to certify electors.
[31:36.480 --> 31:43.440]  If they do not certify 270 or more electors for any one candidate, then under the 12th Amendment,
[31:43.440 --> 31:50.160]  it goes to the House to vote by state delegation. So the president's legal constitutional remedy
[31:50.160 --> 31:56.800]  is for Congress to take up the issue on January 6th. And it could take days because there could
[31:56.800 --> 32:01.120]  be objections to multiple states. There's anticipation of at least seven states being
[32:01.120 --> 32:07.200]  objected to. They're supposed to spend two hours apiece each chamber on their own accord
[32:07.200 --> 32:12.320]  debating it. They should allow for argument and evidence to be presented in that timeframe.
[32:12.320 --> 32:20.320]  And so consequently, you could have 14 hours or more of debate time. So if we can spend two weeks
[32:20.320 --> 32:25.920]  on a bogus impeachment, we can spend at least a few days on a legitimate election contest.
[32:25.920 --> 32:30.400]  And I think that's the president's position and it's a sound one to half. And then what he needs
[32:30.400 --> 32:35.120]  and what he wants is for there to be a mass audience outside. So the House members and
[32:35.120 --> 32:41.200]  senators can witness the power of the support that Trump has for this election contest to occur.
[32:41.200 --> 32:47.440]  And if the evidence and arguments are properly heard out, then there's an excellent opportunity
[32:47.440 --> 32:52.480]  for Trump to at least succeed in the Senate. And then there's open question in the House.
[32:53.040 --> 33:00.080]  And so at a minimum, this is parallel track for Trump because if he doesn't prevail,
[33:00.080 --> 33:04.800]  he wants it to be the case that Pelosi and Biden help steal it from Biden. And that's the other
[33:04.800 --> 33:09.280]  utility of going through this process. Not only is it the constitutional process, not only should
[33:09.280 --> 33:13.520]  he prevail if they actually apply the facts and the law and the Constitution, because this
[33:13.520 --> 33:18.240]  election was not done in a constitutionally consistent manner in a sufficient number of states
[33:18.240 --> 33:23.520]  to give Joe Biden any form of electoral college majority. But the other advantage is if for
[33:23.520 --> 33:28.480]  whatever reason it doesn't work, if it doesn't work because Pelosi is the obstacle in the House
[33:28.480 --> 33:34.880]  with Democrats having a slight edge, then it gives Trump a key talking point for the next four years.
[33:34.880 --> 33:39.840]  It gives conservatives and Republicans a key talking point for the upcoming midterms.
[33:39.840 --> 33:44.080]  And Trump can rebuild and expand his populist movement going forward. So Trump's always,
[33:44.960 --> 33:51.200]  since you know, since Art of the Deal, his mantra has been hope for the best plan for the worst.
[33:51.200 --> 33:58.480]  And the January 6th plan is both. It's both the best can happen, should happen. But in case it
[33:58.480 --> 34:04.400]  doesn't, the backup plan, it works for the backup plan too. So it works for both. So I think it's
[34:04.400 --> 34:09.680]  a intelligent path for the president to be taking. It's the constitutional path. It's the legal path.
[34:09.680 --> 34:13.680]  And the it's the only path he's been afforded effectively at this point, because the state
[34:13.680 --> 34:18.640]  governors refused to take action. The state secretaries of state refused to take action.
[34:18.640 --> 34:23.600]  The state courts in those systems refused to take action. The state legislatures in those states
[34:23.600 --> 34:29.840]  could not convene. And then the federal courts have also refused to take action. And so the as
[34:29.840 --> 34:35.920]  the president said yesterday, his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, laid out the protocols to go forward
[34:35.920 --> 34:39.920]  on January 6th, because it's the only remedy available. And he just has to overcome Mitch
[34:39.920 --> 34:45.520]  McConnell trying to instruct everybody in the Senate to not vote on it. But I think that ship
[34:45.520 --> 34:50.240]  has sailed. Senator Perdue out of Georgia said if he wins reelection, he's going to challenge it.
[34:50.240 --> 34:54.720]  Senator Tuberville is talking about challenging. Senator Paul is talking about challenging.
[34:54.720 --> 34:59.680]  And Senator Hawley is talking about challenging. And Senator Cruz is now talking about challenging.
[34:59.680 --> 35:06.000]  So and any other the other thing that's useful about this, however, it turns out is it's going
[35:06.000 --> 35:10.400]  to put everybody on notice and who's a Trump loyalist and who isn't make him have a vote.
[35:10.960 --> 35:16.000]  So to know who in the house really supporting the president and who is not who in the Senate
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.880]  is really supporting the president and who is not unless it's not just supporting the president,
[35:20.880 --> 35:24.960]  it's supporting reality. Trump won this thing in a landslide. Everybody knows it.
[35:24.960 --> 35:28.880]  So anybody who wants to vote against it, whether it's a Democrat or a Republican,
[35:28.880 --> 35:33.440]  they're just voting against reality. Yeah, exactly. And they're voting against
[35:33.440 --> 35:37.200]  the constitutional election and they're voting against the constitutional process for resolving
[35:37.200 --> 35:43.280]  a constitute a contested election. So in all of this, so the what it does, it puts on notice
[35:43.280 --> 35:48.480]  who's who's really so deeply tied to the swamp that they're unwilling to even exercise their
[35:48.480 --> 35:54.640]  constitutional obligation to resolve a contested election, where the a constitutional election
[35:54.640 --> 36:00.400]  clearly elects the president. A it's only an unconstitutional election that elects Joe Biden.
[36:00.400 --> 36:04.480]  And so let's see if all some of these would be presidents like Senator Hawley and others will
[36:04.480 --> 36:09.840]  step up to the plate or not. And every senator and congressman who does not step up to the plate
[36:09.840 --> 36:15.200]  for a constitutional election and object to the electors from these states that did not conduct
[36:15.200 --> 36:20.000]  an unconscious that did not conduct a constitutional election, then they should be primary, they
[36:20.000 --> 36:26.240]  should be focused on to be challenged in 2022 and 2024. So the it's a great opportunity to get a
[36:26.240 --> 36:31.840]  clear and clean discernment at who is with the country, who is with the Constitution, and who
[36:31.840 --> 36:37.360]  ain't. And there's no better opportunity. So it has multiple advantages to focusing on January 6.
[36:37.360 --> 36:41.840]  It's the constitutional remedy where if they do their job, he's the next president. If they don't
[36:41.840 --> 36:47.040]  do their job, we get to see it and witness it. And the both get to build for Trump over the next
[36:47.040 --> 36:52.320]  four years to build a broader, wider, deeper populist movement, but also to expose who within
[36:52.320 --> 36:57.360]  the party cannot be trusted, who within the party needs to be kicked out of the party,
[36:57.360 --> 37:02.400]  or at least removed from their office. And I think that that's the multiple utility to it.
[37:02.400 --> 37:07.120]  And that's the path. It's the path he's been planning on all along. So the there was all the
[37:07.120 --> 37:11.920]  talk of martial law insurrection act, that was never a path he was going to. Yeah, and he came
[37:11.920 --> 37:15.840]  out and made that statement the other day. And he had people that were in those meetings, you
[37:15.840 --> 37:20.560]  know, double down and echo that. And of course, I mean, we're expecting, though, the the millions
[37:20.560 --> 37:25.440]  of energized, enthusiastic Biden voters who've been everywhere to be there on January 6. I mean,
[37:25.440 --> 37:29.760]  these Biden voters, they're everywhere, Bob. I mean, I can't I can't turn a corner and there's
[37:29.760 --> 37:33.760]  a bind. Oh, no, wait, that's Trump supporters. No way it was Trump that won more counties than any
[37:33.760 --> 37:39.040]  other presidential candidate ever before. So it'll be the millions of Trump supporters that are out
[37:39.040 --> 37:46.160]  there. Real quickly, though, you know, I two things, let's focus on you're talking about exposing
[37:46.160 --> 37:52.880]  the Republicans. Here's what I've realized about these people in the swamp. They talk behind the
[37:52.880 --> 37:57.520]  scenes. It's kind of like with any vote, right? They all know how the the other is going to vote,
[37:57.520 --> 38:01.600]  probably 90% of the times they have to vote. And then they make their measurements. Alright,
[38:01.600 --> 38:04.240]  who's going to vote this way? Who's going to vote this way? If I vote this way, it'll be
[38:04.240 --> 38:08.960]  inconsequential. If I vote this way, it'll be inconsequential. I have a feeling that the Republicans
[38:08.960 --> 38:15.360]  are already doing that. And so there's going to be a couple Republicans that I think are probably
[38:15.360 --> 38:21.280]  deep in the swamp that will vote in Trump's favor. But I don't have much confidence in this process,
[38:21.280 --> 38:24.880]  other than exposing the swamp for what it is, exposing the Democrats for what it is.
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.280]  I don't trust these Republicans, quite frankly, I don't trust anybody in Congress. And my fear,
[38:31.280 --> 38:36.400]  Bob, and 60 seconds respond to this and we'll come back and talk more about this. My fear is that
[38:36.400 --> 38:42.320]  if we don't win this, whether it's January 6 or any of the days in between before January 21,
[38:42.880 --> 38:48.960]  there is no 2024 run for Trump. There's no 2024 run for anybody. Every election is rigged after
[38:48.960 --> 38:53.280]  that, whether it's Democrat or Republican. And now they've basically been given the green light.
[38:53.280 --> 38:55.280]  Yep, we can do this and we can get away with it.
[38:56.480 --> 39:00.320]  Well, I think it's a legitimate concern for everyone to have. Though I think there are answers
[39:00.320 --> 39:05.520]  to that, which we can get to after the break. But the first step is the weakness with Trumpism
[39:05.520 --> 39:09.920]  all the way through was it lacked institutional support. He did not put enough allies around him.
[39:09.920 --> 39:14.080]  He did not surround himself with enough allies. He let Mitch McConnell pick a lot of his cabinet
[39:14.080 --> 39:19.600]  people and judges. He allowed Paul Ryan to pick his legislation. And the combination of the two
[39:19.600 --> 39:24.960]  is what doomed Trumpism to being stuck with an election that was within the margin of fraud in
[39:24.960 --> 39:30.000]  the first place. He should have been way outside the margin of fraud if he never went along with
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.200]  the lockdowns and the rest. But the utility to what's going to happen on January 6 is it exposes
[39:35.200 --> 39:40.320]  to the base what exactly needs the next steps to be. Either they will do their constitutional duty
[39:40.320 --> 39:44.480]  and perform it. And I think a bunch of them, if they're forced to take a vote, will end up voting
[39:44.480 --> 39:49.040]  for Trump and with Trump. But of those who don't, there need to be remedy. And maybe the remedy
[39:49.040 --> 39:53.200]  needs to be a new party. Maybe the remedy needs to be new laws. Either way, the remedy needs to be
[39:53.200 --> 39:54.800]  a new movement. All right, we'll be right back.
[39:55.840 --> 40:00.240]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would. They've always been
[40:00.240 --> 40:05.040]  part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse. If they're able to keep Trump from
[40:05.040 --> 40:10.400]  rightfully taking office for second term on January 20th, the system is going to drop the
[40:10.400 --> 40:15.120]  hammer harder than ever on this Republic. They are going to explode gas prices. They're going to
[40:15.120 --> 40:19.520]  shut down our coal power plants. They're going to cut off the energy source to the US. So it's
[40:19.520 --> 40:24.800]  impossible for factories to move back here. This is economic domination. This is economic war.
[40:24.800 --> 40:29.040]  We are being consolidated. We are being taken over. The Democrats aren't mismanaging their
[40:29.040 --> 40:34.080]  blue cities and states. They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and
[40:34.080 --> 40:39.840]  bring them absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property.
[40:39.840 --> 40:43.440]  This is a monopolistic takeover. That's what the great reset is.
[40:43.440 --> 40:47.840]  Klaus Schwab and these other criminals admit it. That's what social distancing is. So your
[40:47.840 --> 40:54.000]  business is only 25% for several more years. No small businesses will be there. This is a master
[40:54.000 --> 41:01.440]  plan. Say no. Anybody listening to my voice and simply search into the term. Davos Group,
[41:01.440 --> 41:08.800]  technocracy, we're technocrats. You will get Klaus Schwab and Sean Claude Yunker and all the
[41:08.800 --> 41:15.040]  New World Order globalists like Gigi Pink saying that they no longer want elected leaders over
[41:15.040 --> 41:20.480]  governments, that they want businessman technocrats over them. And that's who Klaus Schwab is. You
[41:20.480 --> 41:25.040]  might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you
[41:25.040 --> 41:30.160]  and make you poor. You might want to find out who this super villain is. You see, he believes
[41:30.160 --> 41:34.160]  because he's hidden playing you and you're not speaking out against it that he has the right
[41:34.160 --> 41:38.160]  to do it to you. You might want to find out who he works for. He works directly for Prince Charles.
[41:38.800 --> 41:44.960]  He developed since the 80s the plan for global sustainability. That means worldwide Neo feudalism
[41:44.960 --> 41:50.000]  in his own works. So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.320]  you before you take those shots. You might just want to find out who this villain is. All right.
[41:54.320 --> 42:01.840]  Hey, Alex. How you doing, man? Is this the guy that called in about living defense?
[42:02.560 --> 42:07.840]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I've been trying to get ahold of you since Monday when I heard you got that
[42:07.840 --> 42:13.680]  fresh shipment of living defense in from Utah. I said, man, I got to get on that show and give
[42:13.680 --> 42:20.160]  him an update. I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones show, I'm gonna tell the world
[42:20.160 --> 42:25.840]  about living defense and what it did for me personally. Now look, I'm 64 years old going
[42:25.840 --> 42:32.160]  on 20 thanks to this info for store products. And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other
[42:32.160 --> 42:38.240]  night. So I'm doing what I can, brother. So what my my contention is, why don't we start this new
[42:38.240 --> 42:43.920]  year off right with everybody getting a couple bottles of living defense? Now you got to follow
[42:43.920 --> 42:49.840]  that up with the micro ZX. I learned that. So it's like God working is so amazing. We didn't
[42:49.840 --> 42:54.560]  know. We didn't screen your call. We had no idea. And I go to you a year later and you're
[42:54.560 --> 42:57.120]  here telling me about living defense, living defense, living defense.
[43:08.560 --> 43:15.120]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to band.video with your
[43:15.120 --> 43:20.480]  Safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu comes
[43:20.480 --> 43:27.440]  up, you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest band.video.
[43:27.440 --> 43:32.320]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to
[43:32.320 --> 43:36.640]  stop it. The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override
[43:36.640 --> 43:42.160]  them, have the app and then tell others about it so they can get the app. So it's up to you,
[43:42.160 --> 43:46.880]  whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook,
[43:46.880 --> 44:12.880]  on Twitter, on YouTube. However you want, be sure and share band.video.
[44:16.880 --> 44:30.880]  We're back here with Robert Barnes, attorney extraordinaire, breaking down the January
[44:30.880 --> 44:35.440]  sixth events with the hearings and the votes that will be coming up. Will it give Trump
[44:35.440 --> 44:41.440]  the victory or will it mean another obstacle he has to overcome? And you know, you wanted to get
[44:41.440 --> 44:49.680]  back into that, Bob. And you know, my feeling of this is that it just has the feeling of a
[44:49.680 --> 44:55.840]  buzzer beater. Or to make the sports analogy, you feel like the last possession is going to win
[44:55.840 --> 45:01.040]  the game. And you know that the last possession is going to be with zero seconds left on the clock.
[45:01.040 --> 45:07.600]  Well, that's not January six. That's essentially January 21. And this strategy from President
[45:07.600 --> 45:12.560]  Trump, from my perspective, I mean, I don't have inside intel coming from the White House,
[45:12.560 --> 45:17.600]  but just from a layman's perspective, what we're seeing is that President Trump is leading from
[45:17.600 --> 45:22.320]  behind right now. You don't really see him much, you don't really hear from him much. You hear
[45:22.320 --> 45:25.680]  from some of his attorneys, you hear from some other people with some lawsuits, you hear from
[45:25.680 --> 45:32.640]  some congressmen, but from Trump, not much as far as public statements at all, really. So he's
[45:32.640 --> 45:36.880]  kind of leading from behind. And to me, that's like, okay, you know, you're going into the fourth
[45:36.880 --> 45:42.000]  quarter, you know, the last possession of the game is going to win it. And this is like Michael
[45:42.000 --> 45:46.640]  Jordan relying on Steve Kerr to take over the game in the fourth quarter, you're not going to win,
[45:46.640 --> 45:51.920]  you're going to lose. Now, again, I feel that just knowing enough about Donald Trump, the man and
[45:51.920 --> 45:57.600]  President Trump, the president, he's going to make the last move, whatever that is, whether he
[45:57.600 --> 46:03.280]  measures that on January six, seventh, eight, nine, 10, quote, whatever, he's going to make the last
[46:03.280 --> 46:10.400]  move. So what level of confidence do you have, if you can even put a level of confidence that
[46:10.400 --> 46:17.200]  January six will be the day where Trump can declare victory and say he will be re-inaugurated versus
[46:17.920 --> 46:23.840]  it's going to be another expose of the deep state, the Republican swamp, and he's going to have to
[46:23.840 --> 46:28.960]  make the next measure or the next two measures before January 21st, when the corrupt Chai Khan
[46:28.960 --> 46:37.440]  agent Biden would be inaugurated? Well, I think it's an uphill battle because he has too little
[46:37.440 --> 46:42.480]  institutional support, and that was the problem from the get-go. So he doesn't have enough allies
[46:42.480 --> 46:48.400]  in the courts, doesn't have enough allies in the institutional Republican party. Those who hold
[46:48.400 --> 46:52.720]  elected office, those who hold high-level managerial positions within the government,
[46:53.440 --> 46:58.640]  many of his own appointees are unreliable allies, and he's still fighting a rearguard battle.
[46:58.640 --> 47:04.160]  I mean, it's clear that the OD&I was supposed to issue a report last week about whether there
[47:04.160 --> 47:09.440]  was foreign interference in the election under the 2018 executive order. There's evidence that
[47:09.440 --> 47:15.040]  Jack Pesovic and others have put out that they conclude that, in fact, our key intelligence
[47:15.040 --> 47:20.240]  agents conclude that China was the principal country interfering or attempting to interfere in
[47:20.240 --> 47:25.200]  the elections. And in fact, the Epoch Times has put out a big documentary on the way in which
[47:25.200 --> 47:29.520]  China tried to influence the election and part of its overall approach to the world. And yet,
[47:29.520 --> 47:34.320]  somehow that report doesn't come out. It's been buried until January. And then you get Pompeo,
[47:34.320 --> 47:39.440]  go out and blame Russians for the hack on solar wind, even though there's no real evidence that
[47:39.440 --> 47:43.920]  Russians had anything to do with it. And then you have the same from Attorney General Barr.
[47:43.920 --> 47:47.280]  So he's fighting people within his own administration. And I'm glad you said that,
[47:47.280 --> 47:51.440]  because that's where I was going to go next. What do you make of Barr, I mean, a multiple
[47:51.440 --> 47:58.000]  affronts to reality. Oh, there is no proof of fraud or theft of the election. And then,
[47:58.000 --> 48:03.200]  and you know what, I learned a little bit more about this last night. And we can get into this
[48:03.200 --> 48:08.720]  if you want to, if you want to switch lanes. It seems to me, let's get your take on Bill Barr.
[48:08.720 --> 48:14.640]  It seems to me that Bill Barr is doing two things right now. One, he's either playing coy
[48:14.640 --> 48:21.520]  strategically, or two, he's just completely protecting the deep state. And Gina Haspel seems
[48:21.520 --> 48:26.320]  to be the canary in the coal mine. When Bill Barr says nothing happened that was suspicious at the
[48:26.320 --> 48:33.280]  CIA, he is clearly protecting Gina Haspel's role in the London office. He's clearly protecting
[48:33.280 --> 48:38.880]  Brennan, who was running the whole spy campaign for him to say there was no suspicious activity.
[48:38.880 --> 48:43.200]  And by the way, Stefan Halper is still getting paid. So I'm sorry, I know I'm going off into a
[48:43.200 --> 48:47.920]  different lane, but it kind of just traces back to this. I mean, is Bill Barr completely protecting
[48:47.920 --> 48:52.960]  the deep state? Or do you think he's just playing coy right now to then when, oh, magically he finds
[48:52.960 --> 48:58.880]  the evidence, he'll all of a sudden take action? Well, I got a friend of mine that's a meme maker
[48:58.880 --> 49:03.920]  that's going to be doing the Godfather scene and just replacing the name. Instead of it was
[49:03.920 --> 49:10.800]  Barzini all along, it was Barr all along and replacing Marlon Brando with Trump. It's clear
[49:10.800 --> 49:16.400]  that is what actually happened. And this was always an issue with Barr. The reason why I expressed
[49:16.400 --> 49:20.880]  doubts, you expressed doubts, Alex expressed doubts at different times over the years was his
[49:20.880 --> 49:26.560]  history. This is a guy who came up with a very privileged family. His father is the one who hired
[49:26.560 --> 49:34.000]  Jeffrey Epstein. His father wrote weird books about sex underage sex slaves. Then he his first name
[49:34.000 --> 49:41.520]  to fame is that he's at the CIA working with Poppy Bush to cover up various crimes and illicit
[49:41.520 --> 49:47.760]  activities that the church committee was trying to expose. That's how Barr got his break in Washington
[49:47.760 --> 49:53.920]  was helping the CIA cover up criminal activity. Then he comes back under Poppy Bush. While he's
[49:53.920 --> 49:58.800]  attorney general is when you get the Noriega nonsense, you get the BCCI. I mean, he and
[49:58.800 --> 50:03.120]  Mueller were close during that tier period of time. So this guy's been an establishment hack
[50:03.120 --> 50:08.640]  covering up for corruption his entire career. And then when Trump nominates him, he wins almost
[50:08.640 --> 50:16.960]  unanimous support. So I think all along kind of parallel to the Q campaign, Barr, the the rhetorical
[50:17.680 --> 50:22.720]  attacks on Democrats and on the left and in support of the president were meant to deceive the
[50:22.720 --> 50:28.160]  president into believing that Barr was meaningfully investigating and gonna prosecute and punish the
[50:28.160 --> 50:33.840]  spygate folks that Barr was meaningfully investigating Hunter Biden and Joe Biden in the corruption
[50:33.840 --> 50:39.840]  that that Barr was meaningfully doing undercover investigations to expose voter fraud activities.
[50:39.840 --> 50:44.640]  It turned out he was doing none of the three. It turned out he was busy making sure to bury
[50:44.640 --> 50:52.480]  the spygate scandal. Durham didn't even issue a report. Then on top of that to cover up the Biden
[50:52.480 --> 50:57.200]  corruption to cover up the fact that Biden had been under criminal federal criminal investigation
[50:57.200 --> 51:02.800]  for years, cover up the existence of the laptop, not even disclose it during the whole impeachment
[51:02.800 --> 51:08.560]  scandal. And then on top of that, not only not do any meaningful undercover investigations into
[51:08.560 --> 51:14.240]  voter fraud, which needed to be happening before the election, not afterwards to catch it. But
[51:14.240 --> 51:19.520]  going out and covering up and giving a fig leaf of coverage to say, Oh, I haven't seen any voter
[51:19.520 --> 51:25.280]  fraud. Well, you never investigated any. So of course you didn't. It turns out Barr was a fraud
[51:25.280 --> 51:31.200]  the entire time. I have no doubt the president asked him to resign. And he's but the problem is
[51:31.200 --> 51:37.040]  Barr's replacement is just like Barr. So this is the problem. You don't think Rosen will be any
[51:37.040 --> 51:43.760]  different? No, he won't be any better. Honestly, I'm looking at Trump here. And it's like,
[51:44.560 --> 51:48.400]  and I understand, I mean, things fall through the cracks. I mean, we have a company here of maybe,
[51:48.400 --> 51:51.600]  I think it's like 100 employees, things fall through the cracks here. I mean, you know,
[51:51.600 --> 51:55.040]  Alex gets frustrated. It's impossible to micromanage everything. There's not enough time in the
[51:55.040 --> 52:00.320]  day. There's not enough consciousness in a human soul. But I mean, it's like Trump either purposely
[52:00.320 --> 52:07.840]  put Barr and Haspel in there, knowing how corrupt they were, or somehow they like tricked them into
[52:07.840 --> 52:12.240]  thinking they'd help them. I mean, this is just crazy. When you look at now, the lack of action
[52:12.240 --> 52:18.240]  from both of them, and then their their cover up of all the crimes, their history in the deep state,
[52:18.240 --> 52:22.880]  I mean, it's like, my goodness, Haspel and Barr look like it could you could have chose even worse
[52:22.880 --> 52:28.400]  candidates. And then you add to that, people like Pompeo, you add, I mean, for example,
[52:28.400 --> 52:34.400]  constitutionally, the vice president could refuse to certify these electors. The under the under
[52:34.400 --> 52:38.560]  the Constitution, he's the one that decides what's a qualified elector and what's not,
[52:39.120 --> 52:43.760]  and which electors to read out, which ones not, which ones to count, and which ones not. And
[52:43.760 --> 52:48.720]  even liberal legal scholars recognize and acknowledge that Pence has that potential power.
[52:48.720 --> 52:53.200]  There's some controversy over it. There's some that say his only ability is just to read it.
[52:53.200 --> 52:57.600]  It's a ministerial obligation with no discretion. But the Constitution appears to give him
[52:57.600 --> 53:02.880]  non-reviewable discretion. Yet we haven't heard a whisper of that, because Pence has no intention
[53:02.880 --> 53:07.520]  of doing so. We haven't, I mean, have we heard a word from Pence about this election being a fraud?
[53:07.520 --> 53:13.280]  I saw him do one rally in Georgia where he talked about it. But other than that, and it didn't get
[53:13.280 --> 53:17.360]  much play either. Other than that, he's been pretty much on the sidelines. He did get a vaccine,
[53:17.360 --> 53:23.680]  though. So that was cute. Exactly. And by the way, do we really believe for sure that these
[53:23.680 --> 53:27.200]  people are getting the actual vaccine? No, I don't. I mean, I don't understand the visual
[53:27.200 --> 53:32.000]  display of this because we have no idea what's inside that needle. Right. And so the idea that
[53:32.000 --> 53:37.920]  this is supposed to give me confidence to run out and get an experimental vaccine for a virus that
[53:37.920 --> 53:42.720]  not only has an extraordinarily high survival rate, but for a virus we've never had a successful
[53:42.720 --> 53:49.920]  vaccine for in history, which is another question. But it feels like a bait and switch technique.
[53:49.920 --> 53:53.200]  And, you know, they're probably getting like a vitamin B12 shot or something. But yeah,
[53:53.200 --> 53:58.640]  I mean, how confident must they be where they have to go on TV and do the whole optical thing?
[53:58.640 --> 54:01.520]  Look, I'm getting it. It's safe. It's effective. You can get it too.
[54:03.520 --> 54:09.680]  Exactly. There's no doubt about it. It has auras of Hillary Clinton opening up that barb,
[54:09.680 --> 54:13.040]  that bottle of, what was it? Pickles or whatever to show how strong she was?
[54:13.040 --> 54:17.360]  The pickles. That was the pickle gate.
[54:18.320 --> 54:20.560]  Yes, exactly. The door was already open.
[54:22.320 --> 54:27.760]  It's, well, hey, I guess it's apropos because everything about COVID-19 has been designed
[54:27.760 --> 54:33.760]  to be theater. All right, let's get some final takes from Robert Barnes here on the other side
[54:33.760 --> 54:38.800]  of this short break. The election, the COVID vaccine, which by the way, folks, they're saying
[54:38.800 --> 54:42.960]  you have to take multiple vaccines. But guess what? There's a new strain of COVID. So the vaccines
[54:42.960 --> 54:48.960]  are already irrelevant. It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our

[55:47.120 --> 55:52.960]  Imagine a dystopic novel or dystopic science fiction movie where if you've had a cold,
[55:52.960 --> 55:56.400]  you can be locked up in your home, you can be taken away, you can be forcibly
[55:56.400 --> 56:02.320]  inoculated with drugs that mask greatest vaccines that actually change your very DNA.
[56:02.320 --> 56:06.320]  Well, that's where you are in the year 2020. Global government, the United Nations,
[56:06.320 --> 56:11.280]  all these authoritarian groups admit they're doing it. They even admit that they're doing it for power
[56:11.920 --> 56:17.520]  and control and that they're not even worried about COVID-19. That's what Klaus Schwab and others have
[56:17.520 --> 56:22.240]  said. Thinking about how insane that is. Oh, and big tech's got to track you. They've got to trace
[56:22.240 --> 56:26.560]  you. They've got to control you. You've got to have absolutely your house. You've got to have
[56:26.560 --> 56:31.680]  secret police come disappear you because my God, this thing has one tenth of one percent chance of
[56:31.680 --> 56:38.640]  killing you. Give your ability to cancer or heart attack. This is their takeover. Imagine on America's
[56:38.640 --> 56:44.000]  death certificate killed by the fear of the common cold. Yeah, that's fair monitoring. That's mind
[56:44.000 --> 57:09.600]  control. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Yeah, it's a pretty epic time to be conscious
[57:09.600 --> 57:17.440]  on planet Earth. We've got attorney Bob Barnes with us for this and the next segment continuing
[57:17.440 --> 57:24.400]  to break down the election coming up. Let's get back into the election. Pence could basically be
[57:24.400 --> 57:33.680]  a wild card here or a Trump card, pun not intended, with the discretion that he could take. People
[57:33.680 --> 57:40.000]  could debate it all day long whether he has that as part of his job, but he could do it and set
[57:40.000 --> 57:46.320]  that precedent. But I just have a feeling that this is going to have to be so extreme. I mean,
[57:46.320 --> 57:50.560]  when you steal an election like this, when you lock down a country like this, when you are so
[57:50.560 --> 57:57.520]  deep in criminal activity, I mean, I'm honestly afraid that if they put Biden in, they'll send
[57:57.520 --> 58:03.680]  a SWAT team with guns drawn to raid Trump's family and arrest them all the next day. I mean, I may
[58:03.680 --> 58:07.520]  be extreme in that belief. I just think that's how criminal they are and they're going for
[58:07.520 --> 58:12.080]  broke right now. Now, I don't think Trump's dumb. I think he's probably aware of this. He's been in
[58:12.080 --> 58:19.360]  DC long enough to realize how corrupted it is. But I'm just wondering if the people around them
[58:19.360 --> 58:23.440]  that he considers allies that are probably fighting for him, like Jenna Ellis and others,
[58:23.440 --> 58:28.320]  if they're not underestimating how bad this criminal behavior is, they're focused on an
[58:28.320 --> 58:33.600]  election fraud. We're talking about people that lie us into wars where millions of people die.
[58:33.600 --> 58:38.160]  I mean, you don't think for a second they'll come arrest Trump if they think he's a threat to their
[58:38.160 --> 58:45.200]  global hegemony and global government that they have coming up. So talk about Pence's role or
[58:45.200 --> 58:50.240]  potential role in this coming up. And I mean, just the seriousness of this criminal behavior as an
[58:50.240 --> 58:56.160]  attorney. Yeah, so two different components there. One, Pence clearly is president of the Senate and
[58:56.160 --> 59:00.880]  the way the Electoral College works, like there's some talk that the Electoral College has voted
[59:00.880 --> 59:05.520]  not from a legal perspective. The vote doesn't count until the vote is certified by the relevant
[59:05.520 --> 59:11.360]  officials. And so the and that goes to the president of the Senate, who is the current
[59:11.360 --> 59:16.800]  vice president. And so the current vice president has the non-reviewable authority under the
[59:16.800 --> 59:21.440]  Constitution to say which electors counted and which ones didn't. And there's some people that
[59:21.440 --> 59:26.320]  see that as a limited duty. There's others, liberal legal scholars, having knowledge that's very
[59:26.320 --> 59:33.520]  broad. And do we have any doubt that if the roles were reversed, and this was Kamala Harris or Joe
[59:33.520 --> 59:41.600]  Biden in 2012 for Obama or any Democrat that they would have eagerly exercised their power to put
[59:41.600 --> 59:47.040]  their own party in power. So the it's extraordinary. So there's no doubt in here, there's legitimate
[59:47.040 --> 59:52.400]  objections. We have seven states that have sent Republican electors. The Republican electors have
[59:52.400 --> 59:59.680]  voted and sent those up. And by the way, that was the same as 1876. In 1876, the official canvassing
[59:59.680 --> 1:00:06.000]  board all sent Republican electors. And then Democrats got together and sent their own electors.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:11.120]  So the only and that led to a two month debate in Congress as to whose electors were legitimate.
[1:00:11.120 --> 1:00:15.280]  And they passed a law since then the Electoral Count Act that says they'll take the votes of the
[1:00:15.280 --> 1:00:21.280]  governor. But the that that law cannot be override the Constitution and cannot be binding on a new
[1:00:21.280 --> 1:00:25.680]  Congress, which this will be, even though the vice president is the same as the president of the
[1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:30.800]  Senate, the current one, the Congress members will be new. It will be the newly sworn in House
[1:00:30.800 --> 1:00:36.240]  members and senators. And that's why it makes so the what what Pence has the power to do is to say,
[1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:40.640]  I've got competing electors, you're going to have to vote on it. The way that the reason why that
[1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:47.200]  could change the script is if he says, I'm going to say that the Republican electors are the electors,
[1:00:47.200 --> 1:00:52.640]  then the House and the Senate both have to override that by objecting. And, you know, the and that
[1:00:52.640 --> 1:00:57.600]  won't happen, you know, as many or or it's unlikely to happen. And there's a risk of it, given how
[1:00:57.600 --> 1:01:02.880]  many traders there are. But that goes back to the core issue, which is the problem that we have
[1:01:02.880 --> 1:01:08.560]  right now that for people that support a constitutional election in this case, is we have too few
[1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:13.840]  out. We had we had a man more than we had a movement. And we did not have enough Trumpist
[1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:19.040]  and wide ranging positions of power, including as people are now realizing your local election
[1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:23.760]  board in your local city or county, including your local state House member or state senator,
[1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:28.720]  that these positions ended up being potentially very impactful in this election. And what we need
[1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:34.800]  to realize is we need to build a Jacksonian movement of scale and scope. Because as you know,
[1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:37.760]  that's the only thing that's going to push back against any of these people. Otherwise,
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:42.640]  they will grab power, seize power and crush their adversaries. We need a mass movement
[1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:47.760]  to resist it and to push back against those local level people that I had to deal with here in
[1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:53.360]  Texas. They keep the Republican voters from getting fully behind Trump. So that could change, though.
[1:01:54.160 --> 1:01:58.640]  I've got some really exciting goodness. And I've also got some bad news.
[1:01:59.280 --> 1:02:06.800]  Info wars is getting the highest traffic we have ever gotten since the election in 2016. Despite
[1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:12.080]  all the bans, all of the system trying to censor us and suppress us, you with your word of mouth
[1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:16.720]  have overridden that. And they are so scared of info wars.com and banned on video. And they're so
[1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:22.160]  scared of you being able to communicate and share the truth. But we're bringing in the same amount
[1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:26.160]  of money we brought in last December right now. This is our most important month to be able to
[1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:30.640]  fund ourselves in the next year. And I understand the economy shut down. I understand there's not
[1:02:30.640 --> 1:02:33.840]  as much money as they're used to be. They're trying to kill Trump's recovery. But info wars
[1:02:33.840 --> 1:02:38.000]  really need your support. You just buy great items for your Christmas shopping and info
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:42.960]  wars store.com with huge sales, amazing products. And then you know you're funding the info war
[1:02:42.960 --> 1:02:47.120]  and not funding Amazon and Jeff Bezos and the globalists that are openly trying to destroy
[1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:51.200]  small businesses continue to fund the second American Revolution will get in great products
[1:02:51.200 --> 1:03:02.160]  the same time at info wars store.com. Thank you. We're in the second hour here of the Alex Jones
[1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:08.640]  show. Owen Schroder sitting in for Alex last segment here with Bob Barnes. And you know,
[1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:16.000]  I just have the feeling that it's going to come down to that old cliche and Trump's going to
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:20.720]  realize that you want something done right, you're just going to have to do it yourself.
[1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:23.840]  And I just have a feeling it's going to come down to that for President Trump,
[1:03:23.840 --> 1:03:28.400]  sadly, because of the cowards that he has surrounded himself with. But let's get into that
[1:03:28.400 --> 1:03:34.080]  other component, Bob, because I know you can you can run on with this subject for a long time.
[1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:39.520]  I mean, just the amount of the criminal activity, whether it's the government shutdowns that are
[1:03:39.520 --> 1:03:44.960]  killing us. And now they say, oh, here's 600 bucks. Meanwhile, billions of dollars are going out to
[1:03:44.960 --> 1:03:50.160]  foreign nations. They're just blatant theft of this election and the Supreme Court balks.
[1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:53.840]  I mean, it's just incredible. So that's my biggest fear here is that
[1:03:53.840 --> 1:03:59.840]  that the criminal activity level is like, I mean, it's it's a 10 out of 10 criminal activity.
[1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:05.360]  The fight against the criminal activity is like a one, maybe a two, maybe a three out of 10,
[1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:11.920]  if we're lucky. I mean, so it's like, I just don't see that, you know, that has the fight
[1:04:11.920 --> 1:04:15.840]  against the criminal activity has to be ramped up to at least an eight for us to have a chance.
[1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:20.640]  And again, it's like Trump is the man in the arena, just looking around waiting for reinforcements,
[1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:26.080]  Bueller, Bueller, Bueller, just begging someone to come along. So it's either we're going to have
[1:04:26.080 --> 1:04:30.720]  that rush of reinforcements next month, or I think Trump's just going to have to do it himself.
[1:04:30.720 --> 1:04:33.440]  Bob Barnes, I give you the platform here for the next eight minutes.
[1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:39.600]  So I think there's two sort of a bifurcated approach to this. There's no question. The problem
[1:04:39.600 --> 1:04:44.560]  has been Trump, this was too much about a man, not enough about a movement, and not enough
[1:04:44.560 --> 1:04:49.840]  institutional allies so that people often saw Trump as the only line of defense that Trump was
[1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:55.520]  the last wall to protection of the constitutional republic against those that would take it down.
[1:04:55.520 --> 1:05:00.480]  And I think the real answer is that the last wall of defense are the people themselves.
[1:05:00.480 --> 1:05:05.040]  And that means seizing and taking power constitutionally, legally, and democratically
[1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:08.960]  through all the means we have available to us. We can all, I mean, everybody can be on an
[1:05:08.960 --> 1:05:13.040]  election board if they fight hard enough to do it. Instead, we've allowed insiders to take care of
[1:05:13.040 --> 1:05:17.360]  our local city, county election boards. I mean, people could have been, and this includes small
[1:05:17.360 --> 1:05:21.600]  counties. There are small rural counties. Like let's say you have a problem with Dominion Software.
[1:05:21.600 --> 1:05:25.760]  Well, you can get on a small county that has Dominion Software and investigate it using your
[1:05:25.760 --> 1:05:30.640]  election board access. That what's happened is people look to the top to rescue them when in
[1:05:30.640 --> 1:05:35.360]  reality it was always going to be the ground soldiers who needed to do the rescuing. And
[1:05:35.360 --> 1:05:40.000]  that means mass movement. That means going and doing a mass march on January 6th in Washington,
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:44.960]  D.C. to show everybody that you are sticking with Trump. But it's not just that. It means taking
[1:05:44.960 --> 1:05:49.840]  action all across the country, in your local town, in your local city, in your local county,
[1:05:49.840 --> 1:05:54.640]  in your state, for a state house, for a state senate, for county commissioner, for election
[1:05:54.640 --> 1:05:59.360]  board, all of it. Because what's coming down the pipeline, it looks increasingly given the courts
[1:05:59.360 --> 1:06:04.560]  are effectively closed to constitutional remedy in too many places and in too many cases. Then
[1:06:04.560 --> 1:06:10.080]  the remedy has to be us. For example, look at the people that have decided to fight back against
[1:06:10.080 --> 1:06:15.280]  the lockdowns by recalling governor, including it looks like Newsom is going to face a recall vote,
[1:06:15.280 --> 1:06:21.920]  which has shocked the democratic establishment in California. The people, the Georgia Secretary of
[1:06:21.920 --> 1:06:28.080]  State can be recalled. The governor can be recalled. So using the power of, using the power and tools
[1:06:28.080 --> 1:06:33.440]  of direct democracy, using recall powers, using initiative and referendum powers, it looks like
[1:06:33.440 --> 1:06:38.880]  we're going to need to add to the state law or state constitution provisions that protect informed
[1:06:38.880 --> 1:06:44.400]  consent. That, you know, the Nuremberg Accord was designed to say that you cannot ever be forced to
[1:06:44.400 --> 1:06:49.600]  get invasive medical treatment without your informed consent in response to the Nazis and
[1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:54.240]  everything that happened. But now you have people out there advocating for forced vaccinations as a
[1:06:54.240 --> 1:07:00.080]  condition of employment, condition of education, condition of access to travel, or even required
[1:07:00.080 --> 1:07:05.200]  period as a condition of citizenship under penalty of fine or prison. That means we now,
[1:07:05.200 --> 1:07:08.320]  while the court should push back against that, and I think there's constitutional arguments
[1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:12.240]  the other way, what the courts have shown is that they have been co-opted by the political
[1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:17.120]  establishment. They share the same professional class prejudices as the rest of the professional
[1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:22.080]  class, which has been historically and ancestrally anti-populous. We cannot trust them to be the
[1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:26.640]  ultimate solution. That's why I'm working with Robert Kennedy to build a mass movement to make
[1:07:26.640 --> 1:07:30.880]  sure the laws reflect, you know, using whatever legal remedy we have available to us, whether it's
[1:07:30.880 --> 1:07:35.680]  the Discrimination Against Disability Act, which the Americans with Disability Act that prohibits
[1:07:35.680 --> 1:07:40.240]  discrimination against the disabled, challenging that when they're misusing forced vaccinations
[1:07:40.240 --> 1:07:46.080]  or enforced masks as a condition of employment or access when that violates those laws, same with
[1:07:46.080 --> 1:07:50.000]  HIPAA laws where they're basically forcing you to disclose information that should be medically
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:55.360]  private and bringing every constitutional challenge we can. But in the end, we likely need to create
[1:07:55.360 --> 1:08:01.280]  new laws that say, no, you cannot do invasive medical treatment unless in fact you have informed
[1:08:01.280 --> 1:08:05.440]  consent from the individual. We need the same with elections. How do we prevent this from
[1:08:05.440 --> 1:08:09.920]  ever happening again? Change the election laws. And often this can be done through initiatives
[1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:14.240]  and referendums. Sometimes it can be done at the state level through new laws. It can also be done
[1:08:14.240 --> 1:08:17.920]  often at the city or county level because that's where votes are counted. That's where votes are
[1:08:17.920 --> 1:08:22.800]  gathered. They're often gathered at your local precinct. Imagine if everybody had exercised their
[1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:26.320]  rights to be a poll watcher or a poll observer this election. They wouldn't have been able to get
[1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:31.360]  away with anywhere near what they got away with. So the goal is we have to take back the power
[1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:37.280]  ourselves. Relying upon and depending upon Trump to be that sole wall, to be that sole
[1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:43.520]  protector of liberty was always a mistake, frankly. And now the president amplified that by
[1:08:43.520 --> 1:08:49.440]  putting in the, by delegating to McConnell his executive appointments, his judicial appointments.
[1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:53.920]  It's been Trump appointed judges who have betrayed him. That's what I tell people. I was like,
[1:08:53.920 --> 1:08:58.080]  Trump just getting reelected doesn't solve our problems because for the last four years we've
[1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:02.880]  had a whole host of issues that Trump has not been able to redress or resolve. And in fact,
[1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:08.320]  sometimes Trump has amplified because he delegated legislation to Paul Ryan, because he delegated
[1:09:08.320 --> 1:09:13.840]  executive appointments to Mitch McConnell. I mean, how did Christopher Wray end up heading the FBI?
[1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:19.440]  How did help Hasper end up at the CIA? How did Ratcliffe end up before or before Ratcliffe
[1:09:19.440 --> 1:09:24.160]  Coates end up at the director of national intelligence? How did Pompeo or before that
[1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:29.600]  Mattis end up at the State Department? How did, I mean, or the Defense Department,
[1:09:29.600 --> 1:09:33.120]  the, or Tillerson at the State Department, all these appoint or sessions as attorney general,
[1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:38.160]  you go on and on and on and on of the number of people that Trump put in positions of power
[1:09:38.160 --> 1:09:44.000]  that undermined and betrayed him as one. And I think he's trying to remedy what he can remedy
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:48.640]  while seeking his constitutional remedy of the contested election being resolved either in
[1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:53.760]  the courts or Congress by doing things that hopefully he'll step forward and remove certain
[1:09:53.760 --> 1:09:58.080]  people from defense, remove certain people from the health and human services. Look at our big
[1:09:58.080 --> 1:10:04.000]  cyber warfare guy, Krebs, who the media have said, look, talk about a stab in the back. I mean,
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:08.400]  the Supreme Court stabbed Trump in the back, but they kind of like Pat and like, I'm sorry.
[1:10:08.400 --> 1:10:12.400]  But Krebs was just like, Oh, I'm enjoying this. He like took as many jab. He was like, Yeah,
[1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:15.920]  I'm going to poke you. I'm going to stab you in the back as much as I can. But you know,
[1:10:15.920 --> 1:10:19.920]  you said something that was so key. I completely agree. It really, it is going to come down to
[1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:23.920]  we the people. And that can mean a bunch of different things. But you know what you're talking
[1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:28.880]  about getting people to understand our political system and the political science of it. I mean,
[1:10:28.880 --> 1:10:33.040]  that's a challenge. I mean, that's like walking up to a random guy on the street and saying,
[1:10:33.040 --> 1:10:37.840]  All right, you're a ninja now, show me all your karate moves. They'll be like, you know,
[1:10:37.840 --> 1:10:43.760]  what? Like a karate chop. It's like, so I mean, how that's a major void to fill. I mean, how do
[1:10:43.760 --> 1:10:48.400]  you see that happening? I mean, someone's going to have to fill that void. No doubt. I think,
[1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:52.240]  well, and part of that is, you know, the I've been, you know, drafting letters for people as
[1:10:52.240 --> 1:10:56.800]  templates that they can send out. I drafted election contest that people could individually
[1:10:56.800 --> 1:11:00.640]  file in their individual states. People often don't know the scale their remedies. You know,
[1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:04.560]  in a lot of places, ordinary people can file election contest. They don't need the campaign.
[1:11:04.560 --> 1:11:08.960]  They don't need anyone else. And that they're entitled to discovery. I'm going to start doing
[1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:13.840]  that with Open Records Act request and FOIA request in different states. You can get a lot of the
[1:11:13.840 --> 1:11:18.160]  data about either the machines or about the vote or about mail in ballots or signatures.
[1:11:18.160 --> 1:11:22.160]  All these ballots, for example, are digitized in a lot of states. You can request it through your
[1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:26.240]  own Open Records Act request. You can find out whether the ballots are bogus. So I'm going to
[1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:30.400]  be starting drafting templates like this and the rest, but it comes back to the means of
[1:11:30.400 --> 1:11:35.440]  communication and means of organization. And that's where info wars is critical and essential.
[1:11:35.440 --> 1:11:40.720]  And that's where people supporting the model for reform and revolution in America in a democratic
[1:11:40.720 --> 1:11:46.480]  constitutional manner is the info wars model. It's where people come together, support one another,
[1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:51.600]  support the infrastructure, support the institutions. And it's uniquely beneficial because
[1:11:51.600 --> 1:11:56.480]  a person can get healthier, wealthier and wiser by participating and supporting info wars,
[1:11:56.480 --> 1:12:00.640]  going to places like info wars store.com is the place to buy your Christmas gifts or the place
[1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:04.800]  to buy things for yourself that will make you healthier, make you wealthier because it's cheaper
[1:12:04.800 --> 1:12:08.560]  than the product, the alternatives and its competition and make you wiser because you're
[1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:14.240]  making you're democratizing the media because you control effectively you, the audience,
[1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:18.880]  you control info war. There's no sugar daddy controlling it. There's no big corporate advertiser
[1:12:18.880 --> 1:12:23.120]  controlling it. There's no corrupt insider controlling it. There's only the people. There's
[1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:28.160]  only the audience. And this is a sustainable model by providing information and services
[1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:33.280]  and products that are of value to you independently and separately from the information itself.
[1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:38.960]  And we need to take the same model and continue to expand it and continue to deepen it, use it for
[1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:44.560]  its self education, self empowerment tools and by us reasserting our power, that's how the American
[1:12:44.560 --> 1:13:09.760]  revolution can be real again in America. Well said, Robert Barnes, Godspeed, Merry Christmas Robert.

[1:15:06.880 --> 1:15:18.960]  Big brother, mainstream media, government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[1:15:18.960 --> 1:15:28.480]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones and now your host Owen Troyer.
[1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:39.120]  I want to get back into the massive theft that is being called the COVID stimulus bill.
[1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:47.520]  Headline at info wars.com. Rand Paul slams Republicans voting for COVID built. You are
[1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:55.680]  no better than socialist Dems. And he sums it up quite nicely here. Senator Rand Paul slammed
[1:15:55.680 --> 1:16:05.120]  Republicans Monday for voting in favor of a huge $900 billion coronavirus relief bill
[1:16:05.120 --> 1:16:10.400]  saying that they are no better than the Democrats. They routinely label as socialists.
[1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:18.800]  When you pass, when you vote, quoting Rand Paul now, when you vote to pass out free money,
[1:16:18.800 --> 1:16:23.680]  you lose your soul and you abandon forever any semblance of moral or fiscal integrity.
[1:16:23.680 --> 1:16:29.680]  If free money was the answer, if money really did grow on trees, why not give more free money?
[1:16:29.680 --> 1:16:35.040]  Why not give it out all the time? Why stop at $600 per person? Why not $1,000? Why not $2,000?
[1:16:35.040 --> 1:16:40.000]  Maybe these new free money Republicans should join the everybody gets a guaranteed income caucus.
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:44.720]  Why not $20,000 a year for everybody? Why not $30,000? If we can print out money with impunity,
[1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:55.280]  why not do it? The Senator proclaimed. So show me the lie. Show me where Rand Paul is wrong
[1:16:55.280 --> 1:17:03.440]  about this. You know, I see this bill and I look at this Congress and I just wonder,
[1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:09.280]  are all of you corrupt dirtbags? Are all of you bought and sold out by somebody,
[1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:15.280]  whether it's China or Israel or whoever it is, why do you do this to us?
[1:17:17.840 --> 1:17:23.440]  It's an insult to our intelligence. It's an insult to our integrity.
[1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:32.400]  And it's a death blow to our economy. Now, again, I'm going to go over some of these
[1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:41.040]  details of where the money is going. But Rand Paul is right. Why should we pay a nickel in taxes
[1:17:42.080 --> 1:17:45.440]  when they just take our money and give it to all these foreign nations?
[1:17:45.440 --> 1:17:51.440]  They should just be paying us. Now, of course, I don't think I don't want to live in a government
[1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:56.720]  run economy. I want to live in a free market economy. I love the free market. In the free
[1:17:56.720 --> 1:18:00.960]  market, you can be a communist. That's the beauty of the free market. You can be whatever you want.
[1:18:00.960 --> 1:18:05.520]  You can be a commie. You can be a capitalist. You can be charitable. You can do whatever the
[1:18:05.520 --> 1:18:14.400]  hell you want. It's the free market. But this is theft. So they tax us out the wazoo and then
[1:18:14.400 --> 1:18:21.040]  they pat us on the head and say, oh, here's 600 bucks. But look at where all the other spending
[1:18:21.040 --> 1:18:36.400]  is going. You've got $169 billion to Vietnam, $198 million, $169 million to Vietnam, $198
[1:18:36.400 --> 1:18:45.680]  million to Bangladesh, $130 million to Nepal, over $500 million to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador,
[1:18:45.680 --> 1:18:52.800]  Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama to address key factors that contribute to migration of
[1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:57.280]  unaccompanied undocumented minors in the United States. You know what that means? That means
[1:18:57.280 --> 1:19:01.600]  that money is going to be used to bring more illegal immigrants here. How do you like that?
[1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:04.320]  Where they'll steal your money again.
[1:19:07.440 --> 1:19:14.240]  $74 million to the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative. By the way, this is all at Infowars.com,
[1:19:14.240 --> 1:19:19.520]  the headline, billions going to foreign aid and spending bill, gender programs in Pakistan,
[1:19:19.520 --> 1:19:27.040]  Sri Lanka, ship refurbishments. Unspecified amounts, but it's in the tens of millions,
[1:19:27.040 --> 1:19:33.280]  potentially reaching hundreds of millions, to Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Trinidad and Tabago,
[1:19:33.280 --> 1:19:37.760]  and others for assistance for communities and countries supporting otherwise impacted by refugees
[1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:51.120]  from Venezuela. I thought this was the COVID relief bill. Ah, foiled again. This is a quote from
[1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:59.840]  the bill itself. Indo-Pacific Strategy and the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018
[1:19:59.840 --> 1:20:08.800]  of the funds appropriated under Title III and IV of this act, not less than $1.4 billion
[1:20:10.800 --> 1:20:14.720]  shall be made available to support the implementation of the Indo-Pacific Strategy
[1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:21.280]  and the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018. Well, I mean, that's obviously COVID relief, right?
[1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:29.120]  I mean, when you're thinking about how your business has shut down, your restaurants closing,
[1:20:29.120 --> 1:20:32.640]  your bars closing, you can't go to school, you can't go to church with me, you're,
[1:20:32.640 --> 1:20:39.600]  you're laying awake at night, tossing and turning, miserable thinking. If only I could give one and
[1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:47.040]  a half billion to the Indo-Pacific Strategy and the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, then I could
[1:20:47.040 --> 1:20:54.720]  sleep. Where do you think that money is going, folks? Special interest payoffs. Our entire Congress
[1:20:54.720 --> 1:21:02.800]  is compromised and it makes me sick. To Tulsi Gabbard's credit, she called it out too.
[1:21:02.800 --> 1:21:08.720]  She said, I'm not voting for this crap. It just goes on and on. I've got all this here.
[1:21:09.280 --> 1:21:15.040]  Why not just boil it down to this? Here's some of the domestic funding that'll save you from COVID.
[1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:18.080]  $26 million for the Kennedy Center. Nancy Pelosi's little baby.
[1:21:18.080 --> 1:21:26.080]  $1 billion for the Smithsonian where they hide history. $154 million for the National Art Gallery.
[1:21:26.080 --> 1:21:31.760]  That'll fight COVID. Another $167 million for the National Art and Humanities. That's definitely
[1:21:31.760 --> 1:21:38.880]  how you fight COVID and relief. The Woodrow Wilson Center gets $14 million. He's a fighter of COVID.
[1:21:39.440 --> 1:21:46.080]  Foreign countries receiving aid. Egypt gets over $1 billion. That's how you relieve COVID stimulus
[1:21:46.080 --> 1:21:52.560]  in America. Sudan gets $700 million. Ukraine gets $453 million. Israel gets half a billion.
[1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:56.720]  Go figure for that little tiny country. Half a billion. Half a billion, man.
[1:22:01.760 --> 1:22:08.640]  We are getting raped, man. We are getting raped. Rape. I mean, this is a joke. Our Congress,
[1:22:08.640 --> 1:22:15.120]  I think this is the 116th Congress, you are a joke. You all belong in jail. In fact, I'm
[1:22:15.120 --> 1:22:19.040]  dead serious. Anybody who signed this bill should go to jail. And guess what? Some of my favorite
[1:22:19.040 --> 1:22:22.160]  congressmen signed this bill. Josh Howley from Missouri signed this bill. He says,
[1:22:22.160 --> 1:22:33.840]  well, the people need 600 bucks. 600 bucks? And again, over a bill to some Asian deal.
[1:22:33.840 --> 1:22:43.200]  So you get no COVID relief. You get no COVID relief. $900 billion and you get no COVID relief.
[1:22:43.200 --> 1:22:49.120]  I haven't done the math, but I wonder what $900 billion divided by whatever the amount of people
[1:22:49.120 --> 1:22:55.440]  in America are is. Probably more than 600 is my guess. Not much. It's still ridiculous.
[1:22:55.440 --> 1:22:59.840]  Here's an idea. Reopen the economy. Oh, but they're not interested in that because
[1:22:59.840 --> 1:23:04.480]  they're bought and paid for by China. They're bought and paid for by Israel. They do whatever
[1:23:04.480 --> 1:23:10.240]  the hell they're told to do. And so they just voted to financially rape you. You just got
[1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:15.840]  financially cornholed by this bill. Now, I do believe President Trump can still veto this,
[1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:20.640]  and he damn well should. So yeah, you could be, you could have gotten almost $3,000 a person
[1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:27.760]  via this stimulus bill. You get 600 bucks. That is a spit in your eye from this corrupt congress.
[1:23:27.760 --> 1:23:33.920]  You're all a bunch of dogs. You're all a bunch of dogs. This Congress is a bunch of dogs,
[1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:38.480]  including that bitch AOC who says, this is the worst spending bill ever. I can't believe it.
[1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:42.240]  And then she signed her name on it. You know why? Because she got a raise in this bill.
[1:23:42.240 --> 1:23:46.800]  You didn't get jacked crap, but Congress gave themselves a raise. You all ought to be ashamed
[1:23:46.800 --> 1:23:52.720]  of yourselves. Americans should be pissed off about this. Anybody listening to my voice,
[1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:59.040]  simply search engines in the term, Davos group, technocracy, we're technocrats. You will get
[1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:06.640]  Klaus Schwab and Sean Codd, Junker and all the new world order globalist like he's being saying
[1:24:06.640 --> 1:24:11.920]  that they no longer want elected leaders over governments, but they want businessmen,
[1:24:11.920 --> 1:24:16.400]  technocrats over it. And that's who Klaus Schwab is. You might want to look into the guy that says
[1:24:16.400 --> 1:24:21.360]  they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor. You might want to find out
[1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:27.440]  who this super villain is. He believes because he's hidden it playing you and you're not speaking
[1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:31.120]  out against it that he has the right to do it to you. You might want to find who he works for.
[1:24:31.120 --> 1:24:35.920]  He works directly for Prince Charles. He developed since the 80s the plan for global
[1:24:35.920 --> 1:24:42.480]  sustainability. That means worldwide neo feudalism in his own works. So you might want to find out
[1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:46.880]  how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you before you take those shots. You might just
[1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:55.040]  want to find out who this villain is. All right. The post industrial world. That's what George
[1:24:55.040 --> 1:25:02.080]  Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:08.240]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post industrial world. Klaus Schwab with the
[1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:13.840]  Davos Group, Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada. They're all on record saying the great reset is
[1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:20.160]  Agenda 2030. Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is. It is the destruction
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:26.160]  of society as we know it. It is making the population poor. By designs, we can be controlled
[1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:32.720]  with a medical technocracy over you and your family. They're destroying civilization, rebuilding
[1:25:32.720 --> 1:25:40.400]  in their dystopic image. We are fighting this at info wars.com and news wars.com. We are fighting
[1:25:40.400 --> 1:25:45.920]  for a pro human future and we need you to get the facts to research it and share it with others
[1:25:45.920 --> 1:25:50.480]  and join the fight. God bless you. Visit us. Spread the word at info wars.com.
[1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:56.960]  You must guard your humanity. You must guard your children's humanity. You must guard the
[1:25:56.960 --> 1:26:01.760]  very genetic code of the planet. The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of this
[1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:06.480]  world. But they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet.
[1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:12.480]  They are the ones that are now engaged in a genetic takeover of every human on earth
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:18.720]  to the GMO crops. And now they've moved on to their main target, humanity with the MR and
[1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:26.320]  A vaccines, which are not vaccines. They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses
[1:26:27.440 --> 1:26:34.640]  were then inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems. Go read the actual inserts
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:41.760]  for the MR and A vaccines and then remember you've been warned. This is the equivalent of an alien
[1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:46.320]  takeover. Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the globalists are acting
[1:26:46.320 --> 1:26:50.240]  like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us. It's all the same in the end.
[1:26:53.600 --> 1:26:56.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:10.880]  All right. I look, I'm just fighting flipping mad here. I mean, we are getting
[1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:18.160]  just raped by our Congress right now. Just raped intellectually with this stimulus bill
[1:27:18.160 --> 1:27:22.560]  financially. It's just an insult. So I'm pretty mad about that. They're stealing our elections.
[1:27:22.560 --> 1:27:26.560]  They're shutting down our government. It's time for we, the people just declare independence again.
[1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:32.800]  And so this is a whole debate. And Nick Fuentes is about to join me. Before I do that, folks,
[1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:39.360]  I barely plugged today. We have winter sun plus right here with me. In fact, I'm going to take
[1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:43.040]  it on air right now. I'm going to be like Joe Biden and Fauci and then they like to take the
[1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:49.040]  vaccine on air, right? It's good. Look at me. I got a little prick in my arm. So, you know,
[1:27:49.040 --> 1:27:55.520]  if it's even the real vaccine, this is actually winter sun plus that I will ingest right now.
[1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:04.160]  It's been very hazy and foggy in Texas lately. I'm not getting much sun. So I'm not getting
[1:28:04.160 --> 1:28:08.560]  much vitamin D. So I take the winter sun plus there. Everybody knows vitamin D essential to
[1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:14.160]  your immune system. 80% of the COVID deaths, that's the real flu deaths, not the people that jump
[1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:19.120]  off buildings or, you know, get shot. But the actual COVID deaths, 80% of them are deficient
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:24.720]  in vitamin D. But Fauci won't tell you that he wants to sell you a vaccine because he is a henchman
[1:28:24.720 --> 1:28:31.440]  of big pharma. So infowarstore.com, winter sun plus back in stock 50% off right now for you
[1:28:31.440 --> 1:28:37.120]  at infowarstore.com. All right, Nick Fuentes is with me. I know he's fighting mad too. He probably
[1:28:37.120 --> 1:28:43.280]  can control his temper better than I. In fact, I think I know why Nick wears the largest headphones
[1:28:43.280 --> 1:28:48.720]  in the history of radio so he can drown out all the nonsense coming from Washington D.C.
[1:28:49.360 --> 1:28:55.200]  Nick, where do you want to begin the election theft, the just financial and the rape of our
[1:28:55.200 --> 1:29:00.720]  integrity with the stimulus bill? Where do you want to begin? How about we start with the stimulus
[1:29:00.720 --> 1:29:07.120]  bill? That's a juicy one, isn't it? Yeah, I talked about that on my show last night. Hey, 600 bucks,
[1:29:07.120 --> 1:29:12.320]  Nick, you can get a stick of gum. Yeah, yeah, that's right. You can chew your way out of this
[1:29:12.320 --> 1:29:18.560]  pandemic. You can get one stick of flavor flavored bubblegum. I love to see it. Yeah, well,
[1:29:19.120 --> 1:29:25.520]  I mean, the $1,200 was an insult, in my opinion, back when they did the original stimulus $1,200
[1:29:25.520 --> 1:29:31.440]  wasn't sufficient. And then they cut it in half. And what's amazing is not just how little is in
[1:29:31.440 --> 1:29:37.280]  this bill, but how much is in the bill for seemingly everybody else. You know, they tell us that they
[1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:42.400]  can't do better than $600 another round of cash payments, only two rounds of cash payments,
[1:29:42.400 --> 1:29:46.880]  by the way, take down the whole economy. And they give you two checks for less than two grand in one
[1:29:46.880 --> 1:29:53.520]  year. But what's more is in the same bill, $1.4 trillion stimulus bill, they've got money for
[1:29:53.520 --> 1:30:00.560]  Sudan. They've got money for Myanmar, Nepal, Israel, all these foreign nations, but they can't
[1:30:00.560 --> 1:30:06.000]  cut us more than $600. And even more, when you look at the math, I was looking at it last night,
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:11.680]  how they actually break down each provision in the bill. The direct cash payments only account for
[1:30:11.680 --> 1:30:20.400]  about $287 billion out of the $900 billion stimulus, which is included in a $1.4 trillion
[1:30:20.400 --> 1:30:25.920]  spending bill. And so you think about these numbers. It's a third of the total stimulus is
[1:30:25.920 --> 1:30:32.400]  actually going to Americans. And it's less than a fourth out of the entire spending bill.
[1:30:32.400 --> 1:30:36.960]  And where else is all that money going towards? Well, you know, we have some idea. It's going to
[1:30:36.960 --> 1:30:41.200]  foreign wars. It's going to the World Health Organization. It's going to other countries.
[1:30:41.200 --> 1:30:46.000]  It's a disgrace. And you know what people have to realize? I talked about this on my show last
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:50.480]  night, too, is you have to tie this in with what's going on with the Senate right now and what's
[1:30:50.480 --> 1:30:55.040]  going on with the election, too, because this was a bill. This was a deal that was made by both
[1:30:55.040 --> 1:31:02.000]  Republicans and Democrats. Trump wanted more than $2,000 in cash payments for each individual.
[1:31:02.640 --> 1:31:07.520]  They wound up with 600. That was an agreement between McConnell and Nancy Pelosi. This is what
[1:31:07.520 --> 1:31:12.000]  the status quo looks like. Once they get Trump out of office, once he's out of the White House,
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:16.880]  it's back to this business as usual where it's Republicans and Democrats, both of them working
[1:31:16.880 --> 1:31:20.640]  together to screw over the American people and they do with the lockdown and then they don't pay
[1:31:20.640 --> 1:31:25.200]  you enough in the stimulus. So I think it's a disgrace. And I think this is probably what
[1:31:25.200 --> 1:31:32.400]  the next four years is going to look like. When you just you don't need to be that well educated
[1:31:32.400 --> 1:31:38.160]  or, you know, financially privy to understand how this bill is such a theft and it doesn't even make
[1:31:38.160 --> 1:31:43.440]  sense on its face. There needs to be, you know what? I mean, I'm almost to a point now. It's like
[1:31:43.440 --> 1:31:47.840]  forget about the special counsel under the Bidens or whatever. You know what? That'll never go away.
[1:31:47.840 --> 1:31:51.440]  The criminals are never going to stop committing crimes. They say that's the nice thing about the
[1:31:51.440 --> 1:31:56.800]  mob. They never stop breaking the law. But I mean, there needs to be an investigation into Pelosi
[1:31:56.800 --> 1:32:03.040]  and McConnell. Who came up with these numbers? Why the hell are foreign nations getting our
[1:32:03.040 --> 1:32:10.560]  stimulus bill? Why are foreign nations getting more dollars per capita than us? I mean, there needs
[1:32:10.560 --> 1:32:15.520]  to be a criminal investigation of this. This is so egregious on its face. I mean, Americans should
[1:32:15.520 --> 1:32:20.240]  literally be like, I got a little fired up yesterday after what happened in Oregon. You know, BLM gets
[1:32:20.240 --> 1:32:24.640]  to torture people and murder people and antifa murder people and burn down buildings and all
[1:32:24.640 --> 1:32:27.760]  this stuff. But oh, you show up with a Trump and American flag and you just want to go into your
[1:32:27.760 --> 1:32:31.600]  state capital, you get assaulted by the police. So I was a little upset with that. But this is
[1:32:31.600 --> 1:32:37.200]  like the same thing. I mean, seriously, like what the hell is going on? I mean, President Trump is
[1:32:37.200 --> 1:32:42.880]  focusing on the election theft. But I mean, he should come out and do a fireside chat tonight
[1:32:42.880 --> 1:32:47.600]  and just lay all of it out. Be like, why are we giving 500 million to Israel? Well, he may not
[1:32:47.600 --> 1:32:51.760]  say that. But I mean, you know, he could say it all about all the other countries is like,
[1:32:51.760 --> 1:32:55.760]  where is the stimulus for the American people here? And then Nancy Pelosi will come back and say,
[1:32:55.760 --> 1:33:04.720]  OK, we're going to actually give you $666 and 66 cents. Well, and you know, what's so disgusting
[1:33:04.720 --> 1:33:09.680]  about this is they're always pushing on us for whatever reason that they don't have the money
[1:33:09.680 --> 1:33:15.760]  for this. Well, we have to issue austerity or we have to usher in an era of austerity after they
[1:33:15.760 --> 1:33:20.080]  destroy the economy. They destroyed the economy. You know, this is something very important to
[1:33:20.080 --> 1:33:25.520]  point out. It wasn't COVID that took down the economy. COVID is a disease. It was government
[1:33:25.520 --> 1:33:30.320]  policies that took down the economy. COVID didn't force restaurants to close and businesses to
[1:33:30.320 --> 1:33:36.400]  close. The federal government did. We know now that the death rate for COVID is what is it like
[1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:41.360]  point zero zero zero one percent. We know that COVID didn't shut down everything. The federal
[1:33:41.360 --> 1:33:45.360]  government forced businesses to close. I mean, force them into a situation where they could not
[1:33:45.360 --> 1:33:50.240]  make money, could not do business. And now that people are unemployed, now that small businesses
[1:33:50.240 --> 1:33:55.440]  are imploding across the country, now that people are underemployed and their kids can't go to school,
[1:33:55.440 --> 1:34:00.400]  they say, well, the best we could do is $600. Really? And they tell us that the
[1:34:01.200 --> 1:34:06.000]  fiscal conservatives tell us, well, we can't do much more on unemployment because then people would
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:10.560]  rather take the unemployment than work. We can't make the benefits too big because the deficits
[1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:15.760]  already grown so much. Really? Well, when has that ever been a problem? Because for the past 20
[1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:20.000]  years, I don't know if you're aware of this, we've been at war in both Iraq and Afghanistan at the
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:26.880]  same time. And also Syria and also Somalia and also West Africa and also Pakistan and also Yemen.
[1:34:26.880 --> 1:34:30.800]  And we never seem to run out of money for that. We never seem to be concerned about the deficit
[1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:35.280]  for that. And there's never any shortage of money for that. But when it comes to them wrecking the
[1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:40.640]  economy, and now people are looking for work and people are destroyed by this financially and
[1:34:40.640 --> 1:34:46.560]  otherwise, well, now they empty their pockets and say, oh, $600, that's the best we could do.
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:52.080]  Really? I mean, and people have got to stand up. What I saw in Oregon last night or yesterday,
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:56.800]  rather, was epic. And I don't know, maybe there needs to be a little bit more of that because
[1:34:56.800 --> 1:35:00.880]  this is the kind of stuff that we fought the revolution for in the beginning. I'm not advocating
[1:35:00.880 --> 1:35:06.800]  for violence. I'm not advocating for anything, you know, crazy. But this is exactly the kind
[1:35:06.800 --> 1:35:12.160]  of stuff that we fought the revolution over in 1776, you know, no taxation without representation.
[1:35:12.160 --> 1:35:16.480]  I don't feel very represented. I don't know about you, but I haven't felt represented
[1:35:16.480 --> 1:35:21.760]  in a long time. Yeah, maybe we should like, maybe we should just like move to Israel or Sudan or
[1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:28.640]  hell, Egypt. I mean, Egypt got a bill point three. That's right. Yeah, I guess we'd have a better
[1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:32.320]  shot of getting representation in government if we lived in a foreign country. What do we buy?
[1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:35.600]  What do we just like buy Cleopatra's DNA or something? I mean, what the hell?
[1:35:36.960 --> 1:35:42.880]  Well, I mean, it's all ultimately all of that is in service of the Kushner sort of arrangement
[1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:47.360]  in the Middle East, $700 million to Sudan. And why do you think that was? Well, maybe that is
[1:35:47.360 --> 1:35:51.840]  something to do with the fact that Sudan just inked a deal to normalize their relations with
[1:35:51.840 --> 1:35:57.360]  Israel recently. And, you know, Egypt's became the number two recipient of foreign aid after the
[1:35:57.360 --> 1:36:02.400]  Camp David Accords with Israel back in the late 1970s, a similar deal with Jordan in the early
[1:36:02.400 --> 1:36:08.960]  1990s. So, you know, kind of all roads lead to, you know, frankly, to Jerusalem over there when
[1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:13.200]  it comes to foreign aid in the Middle East. Really not here nor there. The point is the money should
[1:36:13.200 --> 1:36:17.120]  be going to Americans, not people in the Middle East, whether they're in Jordan, Egypt, Israel,
[1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:21.200]  should be going to us, should be going to the people that paid the taxes. And you know, these
[1:36:21.200 --> 1:36:27.520]  these politicians, these snakes, Pelosi and McConnell are so vicious and so maniacal. The way they
[1:36:27.520 --> 1:36:32.160]  do this is we'll never be able to track and trace who gets all these kickbacks, because you know
[1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:36.240]  they're getting kickbacks. I mean, even AOC was saying how bad this is, but then she signed the
[1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:42.560]  bill. Why? Because she got a raise. So they put a raise for Congress in here. So most Congress,
[1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:47.760]  oh, I'm not signing this. Oh, wait, I get a raise. Okay, I'll sign it then. Oh, magic. Oh, way to go.
[1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:53.840]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would. They've always been
[1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:58.720]  part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse. If they're able to keep Trump from
[1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:04.000]  rightfully taking office for a second term on January 20th, the system is going to drop the
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:08.720]  hammer harder than ever on this republic. They are going to explode gas prices. They're going to
[1:37:08.720 --> 1:37:13.840]  shut down our coal power plants. They're going to cut off the energy source to us. So it's impossible
[1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:18.880]  for factories to move back here. This is economic domination. This is economic war. We're being
[1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:24.000]  consolidated. We're being taken over. The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:29.760]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heal
[1:37:29.760 --> 1:37:34.800]  and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property. This is a monopolistic
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:39.680]  takeover. That's what the great reset is. Klaus Schwab and these other criminals admit it. That's
[1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:45.840]  what social distancing is. So your business is only a 25% for several more years. No small businesses
[1:37:45.840 --> 1:37:52.560]  will be there. This is a master plan. Say no. The globalists and their minions want to play God.
[1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:59.520]  Chuck E. Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama. You look at these sacks of garbage and you think
[1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:05.840]  why do they hate humanity so much? Why do they love death? Because they hate themselves. They
[1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:13.200]  project their own disgust with their soul onto us. And once you understand that basic psychological
[1:38:13.200 --> 1:38:18.880]  point, every other answer is completely clear. That's why they hate Info Wars. We believe in
[1:38:18.880 --> 1:38:24.400]  humanity. We think you're beautiful. We think you're amazing. Info Wars knows you're fallen,
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:29.520]  but that you have God's potential that God gave you. Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle
[1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:33.440]  is now here. It's now upon us. I want to encourage you all to spread the word about Info Wars now
[1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:38.000]  more than ever when the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth. We know you're going to
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:41.600]  override these globalists. We know you're going to defeat them. I just want to salute you all for
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:46.560]  your action, everything you've already done, because God's on our side and the globalists know it.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:54.480]  Hey, Alex. How you doing, man? Is this the guy that called in about living defense?
[1:38:55.200 --> 1:39:00.320]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:06.160]  that first shipment of living defense in from Utah. I said, man, I got to get on that show and
[1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:11.760]  give him an update. I said, if I ever get a chance to be on the Alex Jones show, I'm going to tell

[1:40:52.880 --> 1:40:55.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:05.360 --> 1:41:12.400]  And now the tip of the spear leading the fight to take back the nation. It's
[1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:16.880]  Owen Troyer. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:19.920 --> 1:41:27.200]  This country's in big trouble when we are being leveraged, when we are being leveraged by our
[1:41:27.200 --> 1:41:37.040]  politicians to the tunes of billions of dollars to other countries. I mean, folks, to put it
[1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:45.360]  frankly, we're fudged. We're fudged. We can't do this anymore, man. Americans are going broke.
[1:41:46.080 --> 1:41:54.640]  We have rampant homelessness in this country. We have the economy crashing and our Congress
[1:41:55.680 --> 1:42:04.480]  just gave us a big fat middle finger and a knife in our back. I mean, I'm just stunned. I'm just
[1:42:04.480 --> 1:42:11.280]  stunned at the egregiousness, the insult that they would even put this bill on the table. And
[1:42:11.280 --> 1:42:16.880]  there needs to be an immediate investigation into Pelosi and McConnell. In fact, I want a hearing.
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:23.760]  I want a national hearing on national TV. And I want Rand Paul and even AOC help put AOC in
[1:42:23.760 --> 1:42:28.720]  there. Let her grill them to give her the platform. I want her and I want Rand Paul and I want all
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:35.040]  of them asking, where did you decide and why did you decide to give Egypt 1.3 billion? I'd just
[1:42:35.040 --> 1:42:39.680]  like to hear your reasoning for that. By the way, half a billion to Israel, which is about the size
[1:42:39.680 --> 1:42:44.320]  of a thumbnail. Just curious. Just tell us why. Let's hear it. I mean, I think the American people
[1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:50.640]  deserve to hear why they get 600 bucks and a kick in the ass. And Egypt gets 1.3 billion dollars.
[1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:54.560]  I think the American people deserve that. Of course, we won't get this because Congress hates
[1:42:54.560 --> 1:43:01.360]  you. I'm convinced they just hate us at this point. By the way, sad story. Just to show you how
[1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:08.400]  crazy the world is. Family of US student jailed for quarantine violation, pleads for her release,
[1:43:08.400 --> 1:43:16.320]  a young 18 year old girl, Schuyler Mack broke quarantine at the Cayman Islands and is being
[1:43:16.320 --> 1:43:23.440]  held against her will in jail. So walking on a beach now puts you in jail. And I don't hear
[1:43:23.440 --> 1:43:28.240]  anyone from the United States government trying to get her release there. But hey, make sure Egypt
[1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:34.800]  gets 1.3 billion dollars. I guarantee you, most Americans couldn't find Egypt, Sudan, Ukraine,
[1:43:34.800 --> 1:43:41.200]  Israel, Nepal, Burma, Cambodia or Pakistan on a map. And they just got over billion dollars.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:46.320]  Nick, I'm just ranting at this point. Nick Fuentes is with us America first. By the way,
[1:43:46.320 --> 1:43:50.960]  Nick, I think it's hilarious. People do this to me too, how they like to steal your name
[1:43:50.960 --> 1:43:56.800]  and then act like their name. We won't get into the beached whales that do that. But I do think
[1:43:56.800 --> 1:44:00.880]  it's funny. They like to do that here with us too. They take the name War Room and then they act like
[1:44:00.880 --> 1:44:04.720]  they came up with it. Not that we came up with it. It's an old term. But it's like, oh, we're the
[1:44:04.720 --> 1:44:09.600]  War Room. No, we were the War Room. And now you're pretending to be the one. Oh, I'm America first.
[1:44:09.600 --> 1:44:14.320]  No, you just stole that from Nick Fuentes. Anyway, Nick, I'm just ranting here. I don't even know
[1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:20.160]  how to direct this anger other than to just hope that the American people will get so upset about
[1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:25.680]  this, whether we can stop this bill from raping us or not. I mean, it's time for Americans who
[1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:31.360]  start asking questions. It's time for politicians to start owning up to the trillions of dollars
[1:44:31.360 --> 1:44:35.920]  we give to foreign countries that they do without a single question asked.
[1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:44.640]  Yeah, well, it's a disgrace. It's clear now that America is owned by foreign powers. And you could
[1:44:44.640 --> 1:44:49.360]  see that in the elections. You could see that in the electoral process, the legislative process.
[1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:53.600]  And that's exactly right. I mean, people should be good to ask themselves, where is all that money
[1:44:53.600 --> 1:45:00.080]  going to and why? You know, really ask yourself why there's a single cent going to Myanmar, right?
[1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:06.880]  And going to Nepal and countries like that. What kind of infrastructure exists on the international
[1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:11.760]  level to make that happen? What exactly is the benefit for the Americans? You know, and that's
[1:45:11.760 --> 1:45:17.360]  really the critical thesis of my show is America first. How is this putting Americans first?
[1:45:17.360 --> 1:45:22.800]  Yeah, I mean, if I could like travel to Nepal or Israel or Ukraine and get like a free housing
[1:45:22.800 --> 1:45:26.560]  and free meals, okay, maybe then that's all right. All right, we get to go there and get,
[1:45:26.560 --> 1:45:30.480]  we should. I mean, we pay for all their shit. So we might as well get free stuff. I'm sorry,
[1:45:30.480 --> 1:45:34.480]  excuse me, we can't curse here. But seriously, I should be able to go to Egypt and be treated
[1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:42.240]  like a damn king because we make their entire damn country. True. It's true. They live like kings
[1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:45.840]  and we're not, you know, Donald Trump said that I think about 30 years ago. And it's true.
[1:45:45.840 --> 1:45:51.040]  He did. He ran on this. Yeah, that's right. That's right. And that's, and I think ultimately
[1:45:51.040 --> 1:45:55.520]  that's what 2020 was about is about taking back that power from the people, taking back that power
[1:45:55.520 --> 1:45:59.760]  from Trump. It's really telling to me that even in spite of everything that President Trump has
[1:45:59.760 --> 1:46:04.320]  been put through in the past seven weeks with this whole election fraud, he's still in the White
[1:46:04.320 --> 1:46:09.360]  House fighting for more money in those direct cash payments for Americans. I think that kind of
[1:46:09.360 --> 1:46:13.680]  tells you everything you need to know. It was Trump initially, the only one in the White House
[1:46:13.680 --> 1:46:18.720]  who was saying that we should have a bigger cash payment in the first stimulus back in the spring.
[1:46:18.720 --> 1:46:22.640]  It was the third bill, but the first cash payment from the stimulus, he was saying it should have
[1:46:22.640 --> 1:46:27.680]  been way more. He's saying it should be way more now. And I think that if Trump leaves office on
[1:46:27.680 --> 1:46:32.240]  January 20th, and I think it's looking more and more likely that that's the case, there goes the
[1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:38.160]  last man in government, literally the last man, the only man in government that cares about the
[1:46:38.160 --> 1:46:42.720]  American people and that wants to put the American people first. And he talked about conducting an
[1:46:42.720 --> 1:46:47.840]  investigation or conducting a hearing. I mean, the problem is the whole system is bogus. I mean,
[1:46:47.840 --> 1:46:52.400]  I know that's a hypothetical, but think of it. I mean, who would do the investigating, the FBI,
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:58.880]  the CIA, the NSA, the DOJ? I mean, all these institutions are corrupt. Bill Barr, Gina Haspel,
[1:46:58.880 --> 1:47:03.200]  Christopher Ray, all of them. And then how about another hearing? I mean, how many hearings have
[1:47:03.200 --> 1:47:09.600]  we had in the past 12 months about BLM riots and anti-Ful riots in Portland, about big tech, about
[1:47:09.600 --> 1:47:15.760]  you name it, it results in nothing. And at a certain point, all of this righteous indignation
[1:47:15.760 --> 1:47:21.200]  from the American people has to result in something. And I think the elites have got to realize that,
[1:47:21.200 --> 1:47:24.880]  you know, just because you steal the election and just because you ban us from Twitter and just
[1:47:24.880 --> 1:47:30.240]  because you kick us out of the conversation, it doesn't mean we disappear. You know, there are 74
[1:47:30.240 --> 1:47:35.280]  million people at least that voted for Trump that are very not happy with the way things are going
[1:47:35.280 --> 1:47:39.840]  right now. And you kick all those people off Twitter, you disenfranchise them from the electoral
[1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:45.200]  system. Now all you've done is eliminated legitimate means through the system by which they could
[1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:49.920]  redress their grievances. What's left after that? You know, maybe you shouldn't answer that. Maybe,
[1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:54.720]  maybe people shouldn't answer that. It might get them in trouble from the government. But at some
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:48:00.560]  point, there has to be justice for what's going on in the country. And we can't resolve that through
[1:48:00.560 --> 1:48:04.960]  the electoral process. I don't know. We're in uncharted waters at that point. And you see,
[1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:10.240]  throughout this past seven weeks with the stop to steal, the system is failing on every level
[1:48:10.240 --> 1:48:13.840]  from the state level, all the way through the courts, through the federal government,
[1:48:13.840 --> 1:48:17.840]  through the bureaucracy and the departments, the intelligence community, the whole thing's
[1:48:17.840 --> 1:48:22.960]  grown from top to bottom, vertically, horizontally. The whole thing's got to go. And either we're
[1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:28.320]  going to have a great purge, I think in the next four years, a great purge of every last Republican
[1:48:28.320 --> 1:48:33.520]  representative that betrayed us, a great purge of every bureaucrat in DC that's part of the swamp.
[1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:38.240]  Now, or things could get very ugly in this country. But, you know, I think that's the
[1:48:38.240 --> 1:48:43.680]  infamous slogan you guys talk about on the show, 1776 happening again. I hope that people are
[1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:48.640]  beginning to ferment a revolutionary consciousness in their mind when they see this kind of stuff.
[1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:51.440]  Like you said, it's outrageous. And there have to be answers.
[1:48:52.240 --> 1:48:56.880]  When I hope the Republican Party understands this, I mean, look, if they want to line their
[1:48:56.880 --> 1:49:03.680]  pockets with all this cash, you know what, at least fight for us. And they're not going to be
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:07.760]  able to do that when, when, when and if they're voted out office, you know, it sounds to me like
[1:49:07.760 --> 1:49:13.520]  we're kind of on the same page here and we can come back and talk more about this. I'm not confident.
[1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:18.160]  I heard every different scenario laid out for me for the last four weeks about Trump's path
[1:49:18.160 --> 1:49:22.640]  to victory. I've kind of just hoe hummed it every single one of them because it's a joke.
[1:49:22.640 --> 1:49:28.400]  We have elections. He won. Okay. But wait, we have all these stopgaps. No, he already won. Like,
[1:49:28.400 --> 1:49:32.080]  what are you doing? So I have no confidence is all these things that have been laid out quite
[1:49:32.080 --> 1:49:37.600]  frankly. I'm not trying to demoralize the audience. But, but the only, the only thing that I really
[1:49:37.600 --> 1:49:45.360]  have is my instinct tells me not to bet against Trump. And I just can't, I have no foresight.
[1:49:45.360 --> 1:49:49.600]  I have no future side of Biden ever getting in the White House. I just can't really see that
[1:49:49.600 --> 1:49:53.120]  happening. It just doesn't seem like that could ever be a reality. Maybe that's just my bias.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:59.280]  Is that kind of where you stand right now too? Yeah, I agree with you. I think that's actually
[1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:04.080]  a nice way of putting it about seeing Biden in the White House is difficult for me to picture it.
[1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:07.360]  But I agree with you about all these different options. You know, we've watched for the past
[1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:13.040]  seven weeks and they tell us, well, there's this pathway where this case in Texas is going to really,
[1:50:13.040 --> 1:50:18.800]  that's really going to do it in or January 6. Mike Pence is going to not count votes and
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:23.520]  that's going to prevent Biden from getting 270. I've heard it all. And honestly,
[1:50:23.520 --> 1:50:28.160]  I just have no faith in the system. You know, I basically feel similar to you. I have no faith
[1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:32.560]  in the system because you're right. Trump won. And we saw it was a joke. It was like a third
[1:50:32.560 --> 1:50:36.480]  world country. I mean, they literally send everybody home who's supposed to watch the
[1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:41.600]  ballots and then they're bringing out suitcases full of ballots hidden under the table. And then
[1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:45.600]  they get rights accounting those at three in the morning in Milwaukee and Detroit and Atlanta.
[1:50:45.600 --> 1:50:49.440]  I mean, this is literally what it looks like in Africa. This is literally what it looks like in
[1:50:49.440 --> 1:50:54.960]  Mexico or Brazil or something. And after that happened, I thought it's very unlikely that we
[1:50:54.960 --> 1:50:59.280]  pull it off. I mean, there was a means by which we could have achieved that through the state
[1:50:59.280 --> 1:51:03.920]  legislatures. There was a path through the Supreme Court. There was a path. But if you
[1:51:03.920 --> 1:51:08.320]  haven't been paying attention for the past four years, the Supreme Court has been missing an
[1:51:08.320 --> 1:51:13.600]  action on just about everything. And that is with the three justices Trump appointed without them
[1:51:13.600 --> 1:51:19.600]  and same for state legislators. Whoa, now come on a second. The Supreme Court is fighting for the
[1:51:19.600 --> 1:51:25.920]  right for a man to have a child. And so I think that for you to discount that here on this show
[1:51:26.720 --> 1:51:33.920]  is is very bigoted of you. Okay, men can have babies. There's no such thing as biology here.
[1:51:33.920 --> 1:51:37.840]  All right, so the Supreme Court is going to make sure that a man can have a child forget about an
[1:51:37.840 --> 1:51:44.640]  election. Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing
[1:51:44.640 --> 1:51:50.240]  with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[1:51:50.240 --> 1:51:56.560]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store.com. Studies have
[1:51:56.560 --> 1:52:02.560]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[1:52:02.560 --> 1:52:08.320]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in
[1:52:08.320 --> 1:52:14.800]  inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested that
[1:52:14.800 --> 1:52:21.760]  high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and
[1:52:21.760 --> 1:52:28.880]  activity of immune cells. It worked for my family. And now I can have a logical and calm discussion
[1:52:28.880 --> 1:52:35.440]  about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member
[1:52:35.440 --> 1:52:42.720]  or yourself at info wars store.com. The pope came out yesterday and announced a global government
[1:52:42.720 --> 1:52:48.080]  corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of
[1:52:48.080 --> 1:52:52.320]  course the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and
[1:52:52.320 --> 1:52:58.800]  finally chip under your skin. It's all now completely official part of the UN Great Reset of the
[1:52:58.800 --> 1:53:04.000]  Davos Group and Cloud Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:09.280]  Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them, at 10 to 21, at 20 to 30, it's here. And only gets
[1:53:09.280 --> 1:53:13.760]  worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all.
[1:53:15.520 --> 1:53:20.880]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, diverse, evil, and stopping
[1:53:20.880 --> 1:53:27.200]  abortion. We must start valuing human life again. We must start saying that we are not expendable,
[1:53:27.200 --> 1:53:34.160]  that we are not disposable, that we are essential. Until we do that, we are all slaves. We must
[1:53:34.160 --> 1:53:37.360]  stand up and declare our basic God given human rights now.
[1:53:37.360 --> 1:53:45.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:00.720 --> 1:54:05.920]  Yeah, you know, I'd like to just close my eyes and listen to country music and just forget about
[1:54:05.920 --> 1:54:11.920]  all this craziness, but eventually they'll knock on my door and put a vaccine in my arm and chain
[1:54:11.920 --> 1:54:18.000]  me to the wall. So can't really do that, unfortunately. That's not the America we live in anymore.
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:25.680]  Nick Fuentes is going to be with us for another couple segments here. Yesterday, we saw a group
[1:54:25.680 --> 1:54:29.760]  of patriots in Oregon just try to go into the state capital that's illegally shut down. They got
[1:54:29.760 --> 1:54:35.120]  assaulted by police. Now, their biggest mistake was they didn't carry a Black Lives Matter flag.
[1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:38.240]  You see, if they would have done that, the police would have taken a knee,
[1:54:38.240 --> 1:54:43.520]  shined their shoes, cleaned their butts, maybe even given them some money. But no,
[1:54:43.520 --> 1:54:49.040]  if you have an American flag or a Trump flag, you get you get beat and you get arrested and told
[1:54:49.040 --> 1:54:55.600]  you have no rights. Oh, by the way, though, I mean, this is shocking. For the thousands of
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:55:00.960]  patriots that went to the state capital in Oregon yesterday, tried to get in and were rejected,
[1:55:00.960 --> 1:55:07.440]  no property damage. Wow. I mean, that's amazing. I mean, it's amazing how
[1:55:08.160 --> 1:55:12.400]  BLM and Antifa have a summer of riots, two billion plus property damage.
[1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:16.960]  Trump's had rallies and marches and all this stuff with millions of people,
[1:55:16.960 --> 1:55:21.680]  zero dollars ever in property damage. I mean, I don't know how we do that. But Nick, did you
[1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:28.240]  see this one? I was stunned. So first, I didn't realize this. About 100 Black Lives Matter
[1:55:28.240 --> 1:55:36.240]  protesters showed up in Milwaukee last night or two nights ago. I'm not sure when it was,
[1:55:36.240 --> 1:55:41.760]  but they showed up at this event called the Candy Cane Lane. Okay, so this was Friday night. So
[1:55:41.760 --> 1:55:47.200]  it's a tradition in Milwaukee, Candy Cane Lane, and they raise money for children with cancer.
[1:55:47.840 --> 1:55:56.480]  And BLM showed up and shut down a charitable march for kids with cancer. So I mean, they really are
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:04.240]  righteous. BLM is really righteous in their cause. Oh, yeah, they're great people. Well,
[1:56:04.240 --> 1:56:09.120]  this epitomizes everything that they've been about from the beginning, which is ethnic narcissism,
[1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:14.480]  ethnic narcissism. I mean, of course, this is just so prototypical that they show up,
[1:56:15.040 --> 1:56:20.240]  say Black Lives Matter. And of course, a lot of them are Black. Our lives matter. And that's
[1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:23.600]  supposed to be the only thing that matters. You know, I think that's sort of the missing part
[1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:28.000]  about Black Lives Matter is that's really only one part of the phrase. It's Black Lives Matter,
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:32.960]  and your life doesn't. Black Lives Matter and really nothing else matters except for that. And
[1:56:32.960 --> 1:56:37.760]  everything is supposed to orbit around that. Everything is supposed to orbit around them,
[1:56:38.640 --> 1:56:43.840]  whether it's the Oscars, the Emmys, the NBA, the White House, Bank of America, I mean, you name
[1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:48.560]  it, that's what it's supposed to be. But you know what, for what it's worth, it seems to be working.
[1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:52.960]  I mean, this isn't good optics for them. But of course, this isn't gonna be aired on any major
[1:56:52.960 --> 1:56:57.680]  network news channel. And of course, all the Black Lives Matter riots are minimized and
[1:56:57.680 --> 1:57:02.720]  downplayed by the media. I remember there was a big study that was done after the summer of
[1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:08.240]  George Floyd riots. And it said, well, most of the BLM protests were largely peaceful. It was
[1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:16.400]  only 300, 300 demonstrations that turned violent, only 300. I mean, think of it. Of course, that is
[1:57:16.400 --> 1:57:22.320]  the, you know, understating. Out of how many? In fact, they just published a story at the Gateway
[1:57:22.320 --> 1:57:27.760]  Punnett. There was a Black Lives Matter guy that ran over, I think it was a Proud Boy March. They
[1:57:27.760 --> 1:57:34.080]  just ran him down in the car. He just got released, no charges. Yep. Oh yeah. And it happens all the
[1:57:34.080 --> 1:57:40.000]  time. And how about the Trump supporters killed in Portland? And how about the Trump support? I
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:43.520]  think it was ran over. I think that happened in California over the summer. It happens all the
[1:57:43.520 --> 1:57:47.760]  time. We know there's a double standard, but people have got to start waking up and realizing
[1:57:47.760 --> 1:57:51.040]  what this is really about. I mean, at the end of the day, what this kind of Black Lives Matter
[1:57:51.040 --> 1:57:56.320]  stuff is really all about. At the end of the day, I don't think they want equality. I think people
[1:57:56.320 --> 1:58:01.200]  have to realize that Black Lives Matter is not out there saying the message of Martin Luther King
[1:58:01.200 --> 1:58:05.680]  Jr. And frankly, the message of Martin Luther King Jr. wasn't even necessarily equality. If you
[1:58:05.680 --> 1:58:10.480]  look at some of his later stuff, what they're advocating for is revenge. They don't want white
[1:58:10.480 --> 1:58:15.360]  people and black people to be equal. They want white people to be put in the same position
[1:58:15.360 --> 1:58:20.000]  that they perceive black people as being put in a couple of generations ago. And they brag about
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:24.560]  it and they talk about it openly. So people got to wake up and see, great, evil, sick stuff.
[1:58:24.560 --> 1:58:28.400]  There's nothing good about Black Lives Matter. It's all sick. One of the most evil groups in
[1:58:28.400 --> 1:58:33.280]  the history of America. Yeah. And you know, by the way, they have every right to the first
[1:58:33.280 --> 1:58:37.760]  amendment just like we do. But the problem is they're not smart enough to think or ask questions.
[1:58:37.760 --> 1:58:40.960]  And so every time I ask Black Lives Matter people, oh, how much money got raised for Black
[1:58:40.960 --> 1:59:07.920]  Lives Matter? Okay, $10 billion. How much of that did you see? Oh, none.
[1:59:07.920 --> 1:59:13.200]  All these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers have come out and
[1:59:13.200 --> 1:59:18.400]  said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones, are basically bio weapons and are
[1:59:18.400 --> 1:59:23.440]  super deadly. And now they're having to resuscitate people that die basically when they take it,
[1:59:23.440 --> 1:59:27.040]  just like newborn babies, they give vaccines. They have to resuscitate them all the time,
[1:59:27.040 --> 1:59:30.720]  or a lot of times they just let them die. And that's on the record. It does that.
[1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:34.880]  Guillain-Marais, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases, but they tell you,
[1:59:34.880 --> 1:59:38.800]  save and effective. No one's getting hurt. It's a conspiracy theory. And then all the fine princess
[1:59:38.800 --> 1:59:43.520]  can kill you absolutely deadly. So they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something
[1:59:43.520 --> 1:59:46.720]  that is incredibly dangerous because the media says it's safe. They do it.
[1:59:57.120 --> 2:00:04.000]  Live from the info wars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:11.040]  And now your host, Owen Shroyer. So the bitch that stole Christmas, Nancy Pelosi,
[2:00:11.040 --> 2:00:18.640]  has said she is going to pull Trump out of the White House by his hair and his hands and his feet.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:25.600]  This woman needs to be, this woman needs to be put into a mental institution,
[2:00:26.560 --> 2:00:33.120]  which of course would be her excuse to avoid jail. But we live in an absolute crazy time right now.
[2:00:33.120 --> 2:00:39.360]  Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York are working to seize Rudy Giuliani's emails.
[2:00:39.360 --> 2:00:43.760]  Folks, we don't get much into this because it's honestly a bunch of Shaden Freud behind the scene
[2:00:43.760 --> 2:00:51.440]  stuff. There it, in fact, most of the civil war happening, at least at a true activity level,
[2:00:51.440 --> 2:00:57.760]  is actually happening in New York and not Washington DC. It's behind the scenes in New York
[2:00:57.760 --> 2:01:04.480]  with corrupt judges and the Southern District of New York and then actual police officers and
[2:01:04.480 --> 2:01:08.400]  investigators who know all the crimes that have been going through New York, whether it's the
[2:01:08.400 --> 2:01:15.120]  Clintons or the Southern District of New York and their politicization. So we're going to have much
[2:01:15.120 --> 2:01:19.520]  more of this coming up here on the Alex Jones show. We have one segment left with Nick Fuentes,
[2:01:20.160 --> 2:01:26.000]  the host of America first. No one else, only Nick Fuentes. Other people will try to pretend
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  that that's their show title. It's not. They stole it from him. We know who you are, beached well.
[2:01:32.800 --> 2:01:37.600]  So Nick, last segment with you here. What's on your mind? What's coming up on America first next?
[2:01:38.960 --> 2:01:44.560]  Well, we're getting ready to go out back to Washington DC on January 6th when the electoral
[2:01:44.560 --> 2:01:48.640]  college votes are counted. I mean, we're getting ready for Christmas, of course, Christmas coming
[2:01:48.640 --> 2:01:53.440]  up this week. And I'll be taking a little bit of a break because, you know, I've been flying around
[2:01:53.440 --> 2:01:58.880]  with with Info Wars for the past five or six weeks doing Stop the Steel in Atlanta, Phoenix,
[2:01:58.880 --> 2:02:03.280]  DC, everywhere else. But I'm going to take a short break for Christmas, New Year's Eve. And then
[2:02:03.280 --> 2:02:08.640]  I'm going to come back on January 6th. There's going to be a big march on the Capitol. And that
[2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:12.640]  is when they're going to be counting the votes. It's going to be a joint session of Congress,
[2:02:12.640 --> 2:02:16.880]  House and the Senate, Vice President counts the votes. And we're holding on hope that there's
[2:02:16.880 --> 2:02:21.360]  going to be an objection from a senator and a House representative and that that might
[2:02:21.360 --> 2:02:26.320]  slow down the process of Biden becoming the president's elector, maybe overturn the result.
[2:02:26.320 --> 2:02:31.840]  I'm honestly not optimistic about it. But I think what's going to happen in January is with a big
[2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:38.080]  demonstration on the 6th and a big demonstration on the 20th with the inauguration, I think what
[2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:43.280]  we're going to do is basically set the tone for the next four years, which is to say whether or
[2:02:43.280 --> 2:02:48.560]  not Trump is elected, if Biden gets in and he's inaugurated, we're not going to accept him as the
[2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:54.080]  legitimate president. And that's got to set the tone. January 6th and January 20th, we've got to
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:59.360]  come back to D.C., occupy the Capitol. And this is going to communicate, I think, to the country
[2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:04.240]  and to the establishment that Trump supporters are not going away. We're certainly not done.
[2:03:04.240 --> 2:03:09.680]  We're not done with 2020. And we're only getting angrier and angrier. And pretty soon,
[2:03:09.680 --> 2:03:15.120]  that's going to metastasize in ways that the elites don't like. I went viral last week or a
[2:03:15.120 --> 2:03:19.360]  couple of weeks ago for saying, destroy the GOP. That's going to happen. We're going to take the
[2:03:19.360 --> 2:03:23.360]  fight now. And I think that's going to be the future is looking past the election fraud and
[2:03:23.360 --> 2:03:29.120]  looking past the events of the 2020 election. It's going to be looking forward to 2022. And
[2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:34.560]  honestly, making a list of every last Republican that voted for this terrible COVID stimulus bill
[2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:40.480]  that votes for eliminating the cap on foreign visas, that votes for that terrible bill by Mike Lee,
[2:03:40.480 --> 2:03:44.800]  votes for Hong Kong, temporary protective status. And they didn't protect President Trump in this
[2:03:44.800 --> 2:03:48.720]  election. We got to get them out of office. We got to get every last one of them out of office.
[2:03:48.720 --> 2:03:52.960]  We got to make them lose their primaries. And we got to get people that are America first,
[2:03:52.960 --> 2:03:58.800]  people that are of and from the country into the White House, into the Congress, into the Senate,
[2:03:58.800 --> 2:04:02.800]  into places where they can actually make the decisions. That to me is the future.
[2:04:02.800 --> 2:04:06.800]  That's all I've been thinking about for the past five weeks. You know, because for a long time,
[2:04:06.800 --> 2:04:10.480]  I thought the end game would be getting America first people in government.
[2:04:10.480 --> 2:04:16.560]  But since this election fraud, that timeline has just accelerated rapidly because the need has never
[2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:20.720]  been greater. There's a great window of opportunity right now. And basically, that's what I'm thinking
[2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:24.720]  about. So we have to take the Trump revolution. We've got to make it permanent. We've got to
[2:04:24.720 --> 2:04:29.440]  institutionalize it. It's not over now. In some ways, it's only really just beginning. So that's
[2:04:29.440 --> 2:04:34.320]  what I've been up to lately. And if President Trump does leave the White House on January 21st,
[2:04:34.320 --> 2:04:37.680]  he better do something to make sure they can't steal elections again. Otherwise,
[2:04:37.680 --> 2:04:43.040]  we'll never have any elections. And all those hopes will be put in my view.
[2:04:43.040 --> 2:04:48.960]  Here's what I'm afraid of. On January 6th, I do believe there'll probably be about another
[2:04:48.960 --> 2:04:54.240]  million people in D.C. And we will surround the state or the capital building there. And it'll
[2:04:54.240 --> 2:04:59.360]  be totally epic. But what I think they're going to do is, and this is just what their game plan
[2:04:59.360 --> 2:05:03.200]  has been the whole time, is they're just going to continue to run out the clock. So they'll find a
[2:05:03.200 --> 2:05:07.600]  way to balk on the 6th. They'll find a way to carry this down the road because here's the deal.
[2:05:08.720 --> 2:05:12.880]  They don't want to make an announcement that, nope, we're letting Biden steal this from you
[2:05:12.880 --> 2:05:18.080]  when there's a million people surrounding the capital building. I mean, I'm not predicting
[2:05:18.080 --> 2:05:24.960]  that anything is going to happen. But let's just say, you know, you're throwing, I don't even know
[2:05:24.960 --> 2:05:28.480]  really what you're doing there. I mean, you're just asking for trouble. I mean, you saw what happened
[2:05:28.480 --> 2:05:33.680]  in Oregon. I'm not predicting that would happen. But there's a chance that would happen at the
[2:05:33.680 --> 2:05:38.240]  state capital. Now, I've already been arrested multiple times there. So, you know, I don't
[2:05:38.240 --> 2:05:42.080]  even know if I'm allowed on the grounds, but maybe even I join in on something like that.
[2:05:42.080 --> 2:05:45.920]  I'd need about 500 people in case they try to come arrest me and throw me away. But
[2:05:46.480 --> 2:05:51.760]  this is what I'm afraid of. I'm afraid the big day is going to be the inauguration day or the day
[2:05:51.760 --> 2:05:55.840]  before the inauguration or that week, because that's when they're going to have to make the
[2:05:55.840 --> 2:06:00.960]  final decision. I think they're going to push this off until the final seconds. And I think Trump
[2:06:00.960 --> 2:06:05.760]  is aware of this too. And that's when Trump either decides, I'm hitting the buzzer beater,
[2:06:05.760 --> 2:06:10.320]  I'm hitting the walkoff home run, I'm having the final possession here,
[2:06:10.320 --> 2:06:13.680]  or they're going to get away with the steal. That's how I see this going. Final prediction
[2:06:13.680 --> 2:06:20.960]  from Nick Fuentes. Yeah, I think that's about right. I think that on January 6th, I'm not confident
[2:06:20.960 --> 2:06:25.040]  that our Republican representatives are going to do anything to keep Trump in office as much as
[2:06:25.040 --> 2:06:29.120]  they might be talking about that. I think that'll be shut down pretty quickly in the Senate.
[2:06:29.120 --> 2:06:33.360]  I think that ultimately Biden is going to be inaugurated. I basically think it's over,
[2:06:33.360 --> 2:06:37.200]  unfortunately. And we're going to fight through the finish line. That doesn't mean I'm done.
[2:06:37.200 --> 2:06:40.880]  I'm still going out to DC on the six that I'm going to keep talking about it all the way through
[2:06:40.880 --> 2:06:45.680]  the 20th. Everything that we could do our remaining options and things like that because,
[2:06:45.680 --> 2:06:50.480]  you know, it's not resolved. It's not written. And miracles have happened before. Donald Trump
[2:06:50.480 --> 2:06:54.240]  is the luckiest man in the world, one of the smartest men in the world. If anybody could
[2:06:54.240 --> 2:07:00.320]  pull it off, honest to God, it's him. So I'm not discounting him completely, but I have virtually
[2:07:00.320 --> 2:07:05.200]  zero confidence that the Republican Party is going to swoop in and save him. And unfortunately,
[2:07:05.200 --> 2:07:09.920]  he's got people surrounding him from his campaign, from his White House and the administration
[2:07:09.920 --> 2:07:13.920]  that are just not giving him good advice and people that are just outright sabotaging him.
[2:07:13.920 --> 2:07:18.560]  So he's really in a very difficult situation. I think ultimately that Biden will probably
[2:07:18.560 --> 2:07:23.600]  be inaugurated without without a major incident. And it's going to be very, very important that
[2:07:23.600 --> 2:07:28.160]  we keep the momentum going. I mean, that's really the biggest thing because it cannot be
[2:07:28.160 --> 2:07:32.720]  overstated. What a big deal this was. What a giant fraud this was. Everybody knows it.
[2:07:32.720 --> 2:07:37.200]  The scope and the scale of this fraud. It's never been greater in the history of America.
[2:07:37.200 --> 2:07:42.640]  And what this effectively does is it nullifies all future elections. It destroys our confidence
[2:07:42.640 --> 2:07:47.760]  in the entire system. It destroys legitimacy upon which the system's authority rests.
[2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:52.800]  This is a really big deal. And people need to internalize that and they need to act like
[2:07:52.800 --> 2:07:57.120]  that. And we need to do something about that that doesn't just entail getting really mad about it
[2:07:57.120 --> 2:08:01.440]  online and complaining about it. We've got to actually do something about it. And I really
[2:08:01.440 --> 2:08:05.600]  believe there's an opening in the next couple of years to do what the Tea Party couldn't do,
[2:08:05.600 --> 2:08:10.960]  to do what the Buchanan Brigades couldn't do. And that is to retake the GOP and make it a populist
[2:08:10.960 --> 2:08:16.160]  nationalist party that represents the will of the traditional American nation. I think as far as
[2:08:16.160 --> 2:08:21.920]  our political options go, that's it. And if that doesn't work, I think we will have exhausted our
[2:08:21.920 --> 2:08:26.400]  so-called political options. I don't want to get too much into what happens after that. But I think
[2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:30.160]  people can imagine we're getting to a breaking point here. We're getting to this collision
[2:08:30.160 --> 2:08:36.320]  course where the masses of people in this country are not being listened to. Our votes don't count.
[2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:41.200]  We're being banned from social media. We're being denied a seat at the table. And at a certain point,
[2:08:41.200 --> 2:08:45.600]  something's got to give there. And you could use your imagination about what that means.
[2:08:45.600 --> 2:08:50.560]  That's how our country was founded. But I think that we're sort of nearing the end of our political
[2:08:50.560 --> 2:08:55.600]  options. People ask me all the time, is it too late? I think it was too late 20 years ago,
[2:08:55.600 --> 2:09:01.760]  it was too late yesterday. And we're sort of exhausting our final, last-it, sort of miraculous
[2:09:01.760 --> 2:09:08.960]  options. Trump, by any count, the Trump presidency should not have happened. It went against the
[2:09:08.960 --> 2:09:12.720]  odds. There's no reason it should have happened. And yet it did. And it bought us a little bit
[2:09:12.720 --> 2:09:17.280]  more time. But I mean, it probably should have been over four years ago. We have a little bit
[2:09:17.280 --> 2:09:22.000]  more time. We have a few more options. But, you know, I think people have an idea of where things
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:27.440]  are headed. People can feel it in their bones that this country is not in a good place. And
[2:09:27.440 --> 2:09:30.960]  something's got to give, something's got to break here. But I can tell you something,
[2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:35.440]  the American people aren't going to go down without a fight. There's an old saying around here called
[2:09:35.440 --> 2:09:41.760]  Liberty or Death. Nick Fuentes, host of America First. Thank you for joining us today. We will
[2:09:41.760 --> 2:09:50.080]  see you in D.C. on January 6th. It's sure to be epic. Introducing Info Wars Life, pure turmeric
[2:09:50.080 --> 2:09:58.000]  extract. This is taken under the tongue. It is pure turmeric. It goes together very well with our
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:03.680]  body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:09.280]  and intestines. This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream. And then the remaining also
[2:10:09.280 --> 2:10:14.720]  is then absorbed by the stomach. So it's more of an intense delivery system. The two formulas are
[2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:18.960]  different, but both are concentrated. And our first product got rave reviews. We've now been
[2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:23.680]  testing this out for several months. Some of our staff like it more than bodies. Some like bodies
[2:10:23.680 --> 2:10:28.400]  better. For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more. And

[2:11:36.640 --> 2:11:40.720]  to you to fight against the globalist harder than ever. So thank you so much for keeping
[2:11:40.720 --> 2:11:56.160]  Info Wars in the fight. Without your support, we couldn't do any of it.
[2:12:11.440 --> 2:12:21.280]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to cover all the news
[2:12:23.280 --> 2:12:26.080]  in the next three segments before Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[2:12:27.440 --> 2:12:35.200]  I'm then going to get ready and get into the war room studio to host the war room from 3 to
[2:12:35.200 --> 2:12:40.400]  6 p.m. Central, my normal host duties here. I'm going to dedicate, in fact, I don't know the schedule,
[2:12:40.400 --> 2:12:47.200]  we may have a guest or two, but I'm going to dedicate the entire war room outside of any
[2:12:47.200 --> 2:12:52.400]  guests we may have scheduled to your phone calls. We've been getting great phone calls,
[2:12:53.440 --> 2:13:00.800]  specifically doing our new morning broadcast, the American Journal, very topic phone call oriented.
[2:13:01.440 --> 2:13:04.960]  We take as many calls as we can on that morning show. Harrison Smith will be the
[2:13:04.960 --> 2:13:11.760]  normal in-studio host for that and we'll really start getting back into the flow of things,
[2:13:11.760 --> 2:13:15.680]  probably, honestly, probably after New Year's, but maybe after Christmas.
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:23.200]  And so we'll get more into the flow here. We have been begging Alex to get away just to refresh
[2:13:23.200 --> 2:13:28.880]  the batteries. So that's why you're not hearing from him today and perhaps maybe not tomorrow.
[2:13:28.880 --> 2:13:35.920]  Of course, he is buzzing around here half the time anyway. That's just how he operates.
[2:13:37.920 --> 2:13:43.360]  But so if you're chopping at the bit to call into the AJ show today, I will be taking calls
[2:13:43.360 --> 2:13:46.720]  for the entire war room. In fact, guys, is there anybody on the war room schedule today?
[2:13:48.240 --> 2:13:54.000]  They're going to check that for me so that we can give a little programming notice here.
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:14:02.400]  Okay, so what time would that be? So we may have a guest at four, not confirmed, but that means
[2:14:02.400 --> 2:14:06.080]  that I can, for the most part, dedicate the entire war room to your phone call. So that's
[2:14:06.080 --> 2:14:13.840]  what's going to happen today. Before I get back into this news, sorry, I'm just looking at all
[2:14:13.840 --> 2:14:20.800]  the numbers that all of our money being stolen. It's nice, isn't it? Before we get back into that,
[2:14:20.800 --> 2:14:31.520]  ladies and gentlemen, info wars store.com has the premiere vitamin D supplement. It's winter sun
[2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:38.320]  plus. We keep it right here, especially during the winter time, right here desk side.
[2:14:40.240 --> 2:14:48.400]  So that I can receive the benefits of the premiere vitamin D supplement on the market.
[2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:57.360]  It that is winter sun plus back in stock. So if you were looking for winter sun plus at
[2:14:57.360 --> 2:15:05.920]  info wars store.com last couple of weeks or so, it's been sold out. That's because whether people
[2:15:05.920 --> 2:15:10.800]  like info wars or not, they know that this is the best vitamin D supplement on the market.
[2:15:11.920 --> 2:15:16.480]  So they scoop up as much as possible ahead of winter. So we were out of stock for a while.
[2:15:16.480 --> 2:15:26.640]  We're back in stock winter sun plus back in stock 50% off at info wars store.com.
[2:15:27.200 --> 2:15:33.520]  And just look at the reviews. It has a 4.9 star review on the nearly 1000 reviews.
[2:15:34.400 --> 2:15:38.480]  And by the way, this is our second winter sun product. We had winter sun. Now it's winter
[2:15:38.480 --> 2:15:43.360]  sun plus. It's been revamped, reformulated. So these are just the second round of reviews,
[2:15:43.360 --> 2:15:47.680]  not even overall for this supplement that's been around for a while, but the revamped supplement
[2:15:48.240 --> 2:15:53.440]  97% would recommend to a friend. And when you see the 4.9 star review there, folks,
[2:15:53.440 --> 2:15:58.880]  that's basically five stars. I mean, if you get one rating, you have hundreds of ratings there.
[2:15:58.880 --> 2:16:03.840]  If you get one rating, that's a four star. You can basically never get to a full five star
[2:16:03.840 --> 2:16:08.800]  ever again. That's just how the system works. So that's a five star rating 4.9. That's as good
[2:16:08.800 --> 2:16:16.560]  as it gets winter sun plus ultra vitamin D supplement. The premier vitamin D supplement
[2:16:16.560 --> 2:16:27.440]  winter sun plus info wars store.com 50% off 50% off at info wars store.com right now.
[2:16:29.680 --> 2:16:35.920]  Let's see hunter Biden committing more crimes, making millions of dollars in China. Well, you know,
[2:16:35.920 --> 2:16:52.720]  nothing to see there. I'm sure Eric Swalwell, Eric, the pool boy, Swalwell, Eric, the fart boy,
[2:16:52.720 --> 2:17:00.320]  Swalwell headline from national file, Intel briefing reveals Eric Swalwell has no place
[2:17:00.320 --> 2:17:07.840]  on house intelligence committee. Yeah, he's a Chinese spy. And you know, if I recall correctly,
[2:17:08.880 --> 2:17:13.280]  Feinstein runs the Senate Intel committee. I could be wrong about that guys. See if
[2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:19.440]  Feinstein is on some sort of intelligence or maybe oversight committee. So you have Chinese spies
[2:17:19.440 --> 2:17:32.480]  running our intelligence committees in Congress. Nice. Nice Democrats. You idiots. You idiots.
[2:17:33.200 --> 2:17:38.640]  And I'm not talking about Feinstein and Swalwell. They're smart. They like money.
[2:17:39.840 --> 2:17:43.440]  So they sold out or maybe Swalwell is not that smart and didn't even realize he was being
[2:17:43.440 --> 2:17:53.840]  honeypotted. He is an idiot. He looks like an idiot. He acts like an idiot. So you had a Chinese
[2:17:56.080 --> 2:18:04.000]  compromised Senate intelligence committee member Diane Feinstein and you had a Chinese
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:14.880]  compromised House Intelligence committee member compromised by China. But hey guys, look out
[2:18:14.880 --> 2:18:21.920]  for Russia. Russia's coming to get you. That's exactly what China would want you to think.
[2:18:22.880 --> 2:18:28.400]  Yeah, look over here. Look at the birdie. Look at the birdie. Meanwhile, China is buying up
[2:18:28.400 --> 2:18:35.520]  everything. All the minerals, all the gold, building islands turned into military bases
[2:18:35.520 --> 2:18:39.280]  in the South China Sea, which is not even the South China Sea. They're just claiming it.
[2:18:40.240 --> 2:18:44.720]  It's the South Asia Sea. There's other countries that have rights to those waters. No, China's
[2:18:44.720 --> 2:18:49.840]  just taking them over and now China is threatening to invade Hong Kong and Taiwan and you won't hear
[2:18:49.840 --> 2:19:05.280]  a lick about it from the Democrat Party because China owns them. You know, man, I just had a very
[2:19:05.280 --> 2:19:13.760]  sad vision. If we don't get Trump back in the White House and maybe even if we do,
[2:19:13.760 --> 2:19:24.880]  I hate this. But I mean, we're basically going to have to become
[2:19:26.960 --> 2:19:40.320]  the activist party that the left pretends to be because when you have Apple and Nike
[2:19:40.320 --> 2:19:47.040]  and Microsoft and the rest of them that have their slave labor camps in China,
[2:19:47.760 --> 2:19:53.200]  I mean, this is just a joke. And you know, that's why, you know, intellectually,
[2:19:53.200 --> 2:19:57.840]  I can do politics all day long here and we can talk about the corruption and ways to fix it.
[2:19:57.840 --> 2:20:11.600]  How do you even juxtapose that with literal slaves in China that make all of our goods?
[2:20:11.600 --> 2:20:18.160]  How do you juxtapose that with literal pedophile networks, kidnapping and raping and torturing
[2:20:18.160 --> 2:20:25.040]  and murdering children? So again, I can talk about politics all day long, but
[2:20:25.040 --> 2:20:30.640]  when you get those flashes, when you go down that path again, because you know it's there,
[2:20:30.640 --> 2:20:33.920]  it's just like, what are we doing here, man? But you know, you look at a Swalwell,
[2:20:34.720 --> 2:20:41.280]  you look at a Nadler, you look at a Dennis Hastert, you know, okay, you start to see what's
[2:20:41.280 --> 2:20:45.120]  going on. These are blackmailed people, folks. It's not good.
[2:20:45.120 --> 2:20:48.640]  The National Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[2:20:49.200 --> 2:20:54.640]  Other dictionaries have similar ones. Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out
[2:20:54.640 --> 2:21:01.600]  force for a political or financial reason. It's basically scaring the hell out of people
[2:21:01.600 --> 2:21:06.640]  until you submit to them. That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[2:21:06.640 --> 2:21:11.440]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News, doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[2:21:11.440 --> 2:21:16.560]  COVID more devastating than they could ever imagine. They told us that two and a half million
[2:21:16.560 --> 2:21:22.880]  people would be dead just eight months ago, within three months, okay? It's a quarter million if you
[2:21:22.880 --> 2:21:28.080]  count all of the people that died of other things. We're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[2:21:28.080 --> 2:21:32.080]  These are real numbers. These are real facts. This is the chicken little event where we all
[2:21:32.080 --> 2:21:36.400]  run our houses, never come out and are taught we're not essential. Well, the big box stores
[2:21:36.400 --> 2:21:42.800]  in Amazon take over the planet. You could stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something
[2:21:42.800 --> 2:21:50.160]  you could put up with and survive. The post-industrial world. That's what George Herbert Walker Bush
[2:21:50.160 --> 2:21:58.000]  signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992. Now they've launched
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:04.080]  Agenda 2030, which is a post-industrial world plow schwa with the Davos Group, Trudeau,
[2:22:04.080 --> 2:22:09.840]  the Prime Minister of Canada. They're all on record saying the great reset is Agenda 2030.
[2:22:10.400 --> 2:22:14.400]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is. It is the destruction
[2:22:14.400 --> 2:22:20.400]  of society as we know it. It is making the population poor by designs. We can be controlled
[2:22:20.400 --> 2:22:26.960]  with a medical technocracy over you and your family. They're destroying civilization, rebuilding
[2:22:26.960 --> 2:22:34.640]  in their dystopic image. We are fighting this at infowars.com and newswars.com. We are fighting
[2:22:34.640 --> 2:22:40.160]  for a pro-human future and we need you to keep the facts, to research and share with others
[2:22:40.160 --> 2:22:44.960]  and join the fight. God bless you. Visit us, spread the word at infowars.com.
[2:22:44.960 --> 2:22:51.760]  The globalists are taking control of the entire human genome. They are forcing mutations. This
[2:22:51.760 --> 2:22:57.200]  is forced evolution or de-evolution. When you look at all the major research, all the major
[2:22:57.200 --> 2:23:01.760]  programs they're carrying out, they are not to produce people that are smarter or folks that
[2:23:01.760 --> 2:23:07.600]  live longer or more oral. No, it's turning humanity into a commodity. Now we see some
[2:23:07.600 --> 2:23:13.280]  propaganda like communist China bragging, hey, we've done mRNA vaccines to make our soldiers
[2:23:13.280 --> 2:23:18.560]  Superman. That's a way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting on our troops. We'll
[2:23:18.560 --> 2:23:23.520]  send things with that into our troops and thousands and thousands of die each time they try a new
[2:23:23.520 --> 2:23:28.240]  experimental vaccine. I've talked to high-level folks inside the federal government and the state
[2:23:28.240 --> 2:23:32.240]  of Texas health department. They say, Alex, we know it hurts a lot of people that's for a greater
[2:23:32.240 --> 2:23:37.040]  good, but that's not even true. And it violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code,
[2:23:37.040 --> 2:23:41.440]  federal state law. This is violence being carried out against us by medical charity.
[2:23:41.440 --> 2:23:44.080]  And we have a right to resist it within each necessary.
[2:23:44.080 --> 2:24:04.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:04.320 --> 2:24:14.880]  This country's in big trouble.
[2:24:20.640 --> 2:24:27.040]  And I just hope that President Trump and his team realizes that there is no
[2:24:28.080 --> 2:24:34.000]  coming back from this. If they let this deal happen, forget about 2024, forget about whatever
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:41.920]  grandiose plans you have. It's done. It's done. Stick a fork in us, man. We're as
[2:24:43.600 --> 2:24:48.160]  gone as Venezuela at that point. We are in the grips of the Chinese Communists.
[2:24:49.120 --> 2:24:53.360]  We have slave labor, by the way. So get ready. You'll be broke, but don't worry.
[2:24:53.920 --> 2:24:59.440]  China will build plenty of slave camps for you to work for Apple and it'll be great and you'll love it.
[2:24:59.440 --> 2:25:02.960]  And so that's where we're at right now.
[2:25:06.160 --> 2:25:09.760]  I've got other news that I want to get to here in the last two segments. Again,
[2:25:09.760 --> 2:25:15.600]  I'm going to be taking nothing but your phone calls today on the war room from 3 to 6 p.m.
[2:25:15.600 --> 2:25:23.360]  Central. Paul Joseph Watson said to take over here in 30 minutes, but I don't know.
[2:25:23.360 --> 2:25:33.920]  When I see this stimulus bill and I see people fighting to get Trump back in the White House
[2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:42.000]  when he won the election in record fashion, it's just joke level, man. So what do you do?
[2:25:43.760 --> 2:25:49.680]  You continue to fight that political fight or do you go back to the bigger issues,
[2:25:49.680 --> 2:25:55.200]  which is the fact that China has slave labor that makes all of our goods, now owns our government,
[2:25:56.240 --> 2:26:07.280]  and the fact that there is a deeply embedded pedophile network in D.C. and Silicon Valley.
[2:26:07.280 --> 2:26:18.480]  So it's just really intense, man.
[2:26:20.960 --> 2:26:26.720]  And just like they stole the election right in front of our face, they traffic children
[2:26:26.720 --> 2:26:32.400]  right in front of our face and brag about it. In their Disney movies with all their symbology,
[2:26:32.400 --> 2:26:37.680]  on the social media networks with all their key words and symbology,
[2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:44.240]  D.C. with blackmailed pedophiles and the Dennis Hasterts of the world.
[2:26:52.080 --> 2:26:56.000]  I don't know, man. So hopefully President Trump wants to do the right thing.
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:27:05.040]  And I mean, it's just there's no evidence of voter fraud. Okay. There's no evidence of pedophile
[2:27:05.040 --> 2:27:14.080]  networks. Okay. All right, I'm going to try to get back to focus on this news. It's just
[2:27:14.880 --> 2:27:19.920]  very dystopian. What's happening here? Anti lockdown protesters kick in door at Oregon
[2:27:19.920 --> 2:27:23.200]  State House. Now, again, I was all fired up about this yesterday. Here's the thing.
[2:27:23.200 --> 2:27:27.760]  It's just about exposing the double standard. I'm not saying you go occupy state buildings.
[2:27:27.760 --> 2:27:32.960]  I'm saying you go in there and you either show the double standard, which is the left gets to riot
[2:27:32.960 --> 2:27:37.200]  and protest and loot and burn however the hell they want. But you have an American flag. You are,
[2:27:37.200 --> 2:27:43.440]  you get nothing. But all you do is you go in there and you just make a statement and you say,
[2:27:43.440 --> 2:27:48.480]  look, we're going to come here and take the Capitol building over every day until you reopen our
[2:27:48.480 --> 2:27:53.280]  economy. But see, I guess that'd be going to the wrong place. You need to go to the
[2:27:54.080 --> 2:27:59.600]  Chinese government to beg for our country to be reopened, apparently. So yeah, I understand why
[2:27:59.600 --> 2:28:05.280]  conservatives and Republicans say that this is bad optics and not to do this. But I'm telling you
[2:28:05.280 --> 2:28:16.080]  that this is inevitable. So I'm not encouraging this behavior, but I understand it and I'm not
[2:28:16.080 --> 2:28:22.640]  discouraging it either because it's inevitable. And what are people to do when their entire
[2:28:22.640 --> 2:28:29.040]  livelihood has been destroyed? And then they kick rocks at us with the stimulus bill.
[2:28:32.160 --> 2:28:43.200]  Ugh, it's even worse. Arizona charter school got a PPP loan and they gave $10 million to a
[2:28:43.200 --> 2:28:48.320]  shareholder. That's nice, isn't it? Primavera online charter school, like many businesses this
[2:28:48.320 --> 2:28:52.400]  spring, sought help from the federal paycheck protection program to weather the economic
[2:28:52.400 --> 2:28:59.040]  disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic. Except it was not a pandemic. It was a government sabotage,
[2:28:59.040 --> 2:29:08.880]  a Chinese run economic warfare exercise. The school received a loan of nearly 2.2 million,
[2:29:08.880 --> 2:29:14.960]  the largest forgivable loan among the 132 Arizona charter schools that obtained them.
[2:29:16.320 --> 2:29:22.000]  But Primavera's loan appears to have been more of a bonus than a lifeline. The school,
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:25.680]  which like all Arizona public schools, didn't lose state funding because of the pandemic,
[2:29:26.400 --> 2:29:32.720]  ended its fiscal year on June 30th with 8.8 million in the bank. The school also shipped
[2:29:32.720 --> 2:29:41.760]  $10 million to its shareholder, StrongMind, an affiliated company owned by Primavera's
[2:29:41.760 --> 2:29:51.040]  founder and former CEO, Damien Kramer. There's just some theft of your money, just like that.
[2:29:51.040 --> 2:29:53.920]  Isn't that nice? You just watch people just steal your money?
[2:29:53.920 --> 2:30:04.240]  Oh man, that's good, isn't it? That's nice. That's real nice.
[2:30:05.680 --> 2:30:11.520]  Peter Navarro story in Newsmax, I've seen the deep state, I've looked them in the eye,
[2:30:11.520 --> 2:30:15.120]  and it basically just gets into everything that we've been talking about today,
[2:30:15.120 --> 2:30:20.240]  how Trump's been overrun and sabotage. And if we don't get Trump back in the White House,
[2:30:20.240 --> 2:30:24.480]  it's over. And in a way, it's already over because we've even gotten this far.
[2:30:29.760 --> 2:30:33.920]  The commander in tweet, Donald Trump says, the Democrats dumped hundreds of thousands of ballots
[2:30:33.920 --> 2:30:37.840]  in the swing states late in the evening. It was a rigged election. Thanks, President.
[2:30:39.040 --> 2:30:41.760]  Maybe arrest somebody. I don't know. Just a thing.
[2:30:42.800 --> 2:30:47.440]  Trump confirms he spoke with great gentleman, Tommy Tuberville, project optimism about January
[2:30:47.440 --> 2:30:53.280]  six challenge. Optimism, how about you won the election? That's not optimism. That's fact.
[2:30:54.560 --> 2:30:59.520]  Devin Nunes won't join January six electoral college fight because he still needs to see
[2:30:59.520 --> 2:31:06.000]  what the evidence is. That's an interesting one, isn't it?
[2:31:07.840 --> 2:31:13.600]  See what the evidence is. Well, I mean, you know, a million votes for Biden at 3 30 in the morning
[2:31:13.600 --> 2:31:18.240]  in six different states and none for Trump. That happens all the time. What are you talking about?
[2:31:18.240 --> 2:31:24.400]  That's a normal thing. Even Madison Cawthorn, who's going the way of a John McCain, a Dan
[2:31:24.400 --> 2:31:28.720]  Crenshaw says that he will contest the 2020 election. I think that's pandering again.
[2:31:29.360 --> 2:31:33.200]  These Republicans do measurements. Oh, who will do this? Who will do that? You know,
[2:31:33.200 --> 2:31:37.520]  how does it benefit? So I don't think the Republican party is going to have Trump's back,
[2:31:37.520 --> 2:31:39.920]  folks. They never have had our back. Why would that change now?
[2:31:39.920 --> 2:31:48.080]  Oh, more censorship story at info wars.com. YouTube removes video of Trump's lawyers opening
[2:31:48.080 --> 2:31:53.360]  statement at Senate committee hearing. Of course, we have uploaded that to info wars.com, though.
[2:31:53.360 --> 2:31:58.640]  So you can watch it there. That's Jesse Benal laying out the damning instances of election fraud,
[2:31:58.640 --> 2:32:04.400]  but they say it doesn't exist. Well, it's just not why it just doesn't exist.
[2:32:04.400 --> 2:32:10.080]  In fact, there wasn't even an election really. It's actually more of an honest statement. There
[2:32:10.080 --> 2:32:18.320]  wasn't an election. There was a selection by China for Joe Biden. So they hacked into the voting
[2:32:18.320 --> 2:32:27.120]  machines. Dominion let them do it in about 13 counties, and they were able to steal six states
[2:32:27.120 --> 2:32:34.480]  by doing so. And thus stealing the election, who's all very well timed out and managed and planned.
[2:32:35.200 --> 2:32:39.840]  So of course, though, of course, the Chinese have been running things like this for thousands
[2:32:40.480 --> 2:32:48.480]  of years. So it's really nothing new to them. But the American people are seeing through this
[2:32:48.480 --> 2:32:58.480]  and Fox News's ratings are dying. And I mean dying. And a former contributor at Fox News
[2:32:59.040 --> 2:33:03.120]  is saying that he's talking to people of Fox News saying they are very nervous.
[2:33:04.320 --> 2:33:10.400]  And they have lost about half of their audience. And that's Eric Bowling making those statements.
[2:33:10.960 --> 2:33:16.880]  So yeah, you lie to the American people, you go along with the the steal of our election,
[2:33:16.880 --> 2:33:21.760]  you don't report reality. And you have a bunch of talking heads who spend four hours in makeup
[2:33:21.760 --> 2:33:27.200]  and zero hours in actual investigative research on television. Yeah, your ratings are going to tank
[2:33:27.200 --> 2:33:34.240]  when the country is in peril. Just where we are at, ladies and gentlemen. We'll be right back.
[2:33:34.240 --> 2:33:38.080]  My final segment here, then Paul Joseph Watson takes over. Don't go anywhere.
[2:33:38.080 --> 2:33:48.480]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado. Thank you for holding. How are you doing, Alex?
[2:33:49.040 --> 2:33:52.400]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can. We're in such a critical time. Brother, how are you?
[2:33:52.400 --> 2:33:58.160]  I love you, man. I want to make a quick plug that DNA force. I love it. I've been using it
[2:33:58.160 --> 2:34:02.800]  quite a while and I just went looked at the ingredients again the other day and I see that
[2:34:02.800 --> 2:34:09.600]  it contains quercetin, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited
[2:34:10.320 --> 2:34:16.880]  is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cell.
[2:34:16.880 --> 2:34:23.360]  So people might want to take a look at that. All I know is with DNA force, we went out and looked
[2:34:23.360 --> 2:34:28.320]  at these high end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the
[2:34:28.320 --> 2:34:31.840]  doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and it's
[2:34:31.840 --> 2:34:37.040]  really only cost them like 50 bucks. And so we basically cloned two different top brands together
[2:34:37.040 --> 2:34:39.680]  and that's what produced this. So thanks. Thanks for the plug.
[2:34:45.520 --> 2:34:48.480]  Anybody listening to my voice, you can simply search into the term
[2:34:49.040 --> 2:34:56.320]  Davos Group, technocracy, we're technocrats. You will get Klaus Schwab and Sean Cod,
[2:34:56.320 --> 2:35:02.720]  Junker and all the new world order globalists like Gigi Pink saying that they no longer want
[2:35:02.720 --> 2:35:08.400]  elected leaders over governments, that they want businessmen, technocrats over. And that's who
[2:35:08.400 --> 2:35:13.280]  Klaus Schwab is. You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns
[2:35:13.280 --> 2:35:17.280]  to bankrupt you and make you poor. You might want to find out who this supervillain is.
[2:35:17.920 --> 2:35:22.320]  But you see, he believes because he's hitting it playing you and you're not speaking out against
[2:35:22.320 --> 2:35:25.520]  it that he has the right to do it to you. You might want to find who he works for.
[2:35:25.520 --> 2:35:31.520]  Yours directly for Prince Charles. He developed since the 80s the plan for global sustainability.
[2:35:31.520 --> 2:35:37.360]  That means worldwide neo feudalism in his own words. So you might want to find out how he talks
[2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:41.840]  about using vaccines to sterilize you before you take those shots. You might just want to find out
[2:35:41.840 --> 2:35:49.760]  who this villain is. All right. This message is not for our regular listeners who are informed

[2:37:04.960 --> 2:37:11.280]  band.video and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned. That's why every month
[2:37:11.280 --> 2:37:19.280]  we launch a new URL before they ban it. But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalist are on our tail.
[2:37:19.920 --> 2:37:27.840]  But the new website is the resistance.video, the resistance.video. They're trying to block us
[2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:33.840]  because the truth is powerful and can defeat them. So the new URL that links right to band.video
[2:37:33.840 --> 2:37:38.480]  and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed
[2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:45.440]  information is that the resistance.video. Share the link. The resistance.video, the resistance.video.
[2:37:48.880 --> 2:37:51.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:37:59.680 --> 2:38:07.840]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[2:38:07.840 --> 2:38:10.880]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:29.760]  Well, the good news is America is pissed about this stimulus bill. The bad news is
[2:38:29.760 --> 2:38:39.200]  Trump's probably going to sign it. So we'll wait and see. But I mean, we, oh boy, man, we the people
[2:38:39.200 --> 2:38:46.080]  are just getting raped from every angle. And I'm sorry to be graphic here. It's just ridiculous.
[2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:51.600]  I don't know how much more we can take of this, folks. I'm going to keep my cool here, but
[2:38:52.960 --> 2:38:58.000]  I'm at my wit's end. I'm done. I mean, it's just a joke, man.
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:03.360]  And now they're about to come at us with the mandatory vaccines. Oh, get ready. If Biden gets in,
[2:39:05.040 --> 2:39:08.720]  they'll come to your house. They'll hog tie you and they'll put a vaccine right up your anus.
[2:39:10.240 --> 2:39:14.880]  They'll say it's good for you because, you know, chemical rape isn't enough. It has to be anal
[2:39:14.880 --> 2:39:20.720]  chemical rape. Excuse me. All right, let me do this news here. And then I'm going to be hosting
[2:39:20.720 --> 2:39:29.200]  the war room taking your calls for three hours, three to six PM at band.video. Here's some of
[2:39:29.200 --> 2:39:35.440]  the latest in the COVID front. You can't sue Pfizer or Moderna if you have severe COVID vaccine
[2:39:35.440 --> 2:39:39.680]  side effects and the government likely won't compensate you for damages either.
[2:39:39.680 --> 2:39:53.840]  You know, I mean, like if you have a contractor build a house and the roof caves in and kills you,
[2:39:53.840 --> 2:40:01.360]  he's responsible for a building that collapses or, you know, any other industry in the world.
[2:40:03.280 --> 2:40:05.600]  You would be held accountable all because of litigation,
[2:40:05.600 --> 2:40:12.640]  but oh, the vaccine manufacturers are above the law. How did they get this power?
[2:40:15.280 --> 2:40:23.520]  I'm telling you, man. You know, Trump, Trump was great. And Trump had great intentions, but
[2:40:24.720 --> 2:40:30.400]  Trump obviously wasn't enough. And if we can ever have a real election again, we need to send
[2:40:30.400 --> 2:40:36.800]  someone to the White House whose campaign policy is literally arrest every trader to this country,
[2:40:36.800 --> 2:40:40.640]  period. And I mean, lay it out. Anyone who's taken big pharmaceutical money,
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:46.080]  investigated subpoenaed immediate hearings, anybody who's had any money for an involvement
[2:40:46.080 --> 2:40:52.080]  like the Biden's immediate subpoenas and hearings. And I mean, we need, we need like Nuremberg style
[2:40:52.080 --> 2:40:57.600]  trials, but, but just for the United States, anything less of that, forget it, folks. I mean,
[2:40:57.600 --> 2:41:04.320]  your lineage are going to be slaves. In San Francisco, drug overdoses have killed four
[2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:08.640]  times more people than COVID. Yeah, that's not just San Francisco folks. There's more people
[2:41:08.640 --> 2:41:13.200]  that have died over drug overdose this year than COVID. More people die of sunstroke this year of
[2:41:13.200 --> 2:41:18.400]  COVID. More people died in car accidents. Oh, but see that all gets stacked up as COVID and then
[2:41:18.400 --> 2:41:24.320]  they inflate the numbers. It's magic. German son, German geneticist says people who refuse COVID
[2:41:24.320 --> 2:41:28.080]  vaccine should be denied medical treatment. Yep. That's one way they're going to do it. You're not
[2:41:28.080 --> 2:41:32.160]  going to be allowed into a hospital without the vaccine and they'll have them all lined up for
[2:41:32.160 --> 2:41:36.960]  you to get it. It doesn't even matter. The vaccine is not effective. I mean, this is one of the
[2:41:36.960 --> 2:41:42.320]  biggest lies. Not only is it not safe, it's not effective. They already say you need at least
[2:41:42.320 --> 2:41:48.960]  two, maybe three rounds of the COVID shot because it's not effective. And now they're saying,
[2:41:48.960 --> 2:41:54.960]  in fact, I have the story right here that there's already new strains of COVID. So just like it's
[2:41:54.960 --> 2:42:01.280]  the flu and it mutates every year, COVID is the flu. So it's doing the same thing. So the vaccine
[2:42:01.280 --> 2:42:06.240]  that you get for COVID, by the time you've gotten the vaccine, it's already irrelevant.
[2:42:06.960 --> 2:42:11.840]  And now Fauci admits it and he says, assume a new COVID strain is in the United States.
[2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:16.640]  You dirt bag. So there's one guy we should have huge hearings, Nuremberg style trials,
[2:42:16.640 --> 2:42:24.400]  and Anthony Fauci. Who should pay for the collapse of the American economy?
[2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:29.680]  Who should pay for all the people that are damaged by the vaccines? Who should pay for the
[2:42:29.680 --> 2:42:34.800]  selling out of our sovereignty? Who should pay? Who should be arrested? Who should go to jail?
[2:42:34.800 --> 2:42:40.240]  Those responsible. Who are those responsible? They're in Congress. They're in the bureaucracies.
[2:42:40.240 --> 2:42:53.360]  British government contracts firm to make COVID freedom passports. Here you go. Here you go.
[2:42:57.120 --> 2:43:02.080]  So your freedom passport, that's like, oh my gosh, your freedom passport is your slave pass.
[2:43:03.760 --> 2:43:08.080]  No, you don't need a freedom passport. It's called freedom. This is your slave pass.
[2:43:08.080 --> 2:43:13.760]  So your slave pass will be, have you gotten all your vaccines? Do you have a good social credit
[2:43:13.760 --> 2:43:19.760]  score? Do you watch mainstream news and only mainstream news? Are you not banned on social
[2:43:19.760 --> 2:43:23.920]  media? Oh, okay. You know what? You can go here. You can travel here. You can go in this building
[2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:27.920]  and go to school. You can go to launch all this stuff. But if you miss any one of those checklists,
[2:43:27.920 --> 2:43:35.120]  forget it for you. And they'll make farming illegal. They'll make any independent means
[2:43:35.120 --> 2:43:40.160]  of survival completely illegal. That's why they're shutting down all these restaurants right now.
[2:43:41.440 --> 2:43:44.720]  And China is killing farmers right now with their weather weapons.
[2:43:46.240 --> 2:43:52.880]  Now, you don't think this is coming to America, but here is a sign. I believe this is at
[2:43:53.520 --> 2:43:59.040]  Reagan Airport. It could be Dulles. I'm not not sure here, but here it is, folks. This is on a
[2:43:59.040 --> 2:44:03.920]  sign in an airport in America. Check your ID beginning on October 1st, 2021. You will need a
[2:44:03.920 --> 2:44:09.840]  real ID, compliant driver's license, enhanced driver's license, asterisk, or another acceptable
[2:44:09.840 --> 2:44:13.600]  form of ID to fly within the United States. You know what that is, folks? That's going to be your
[2:44:13.600 --> 2:44:22.960]  freedom pass. That's going to be your medical documentation. Oh, it's coming. Oh, it's it's
[2:44:22.960 --> 2:44:33.840]  coming. You know, the biggest problem with Americans for the last 20, 40 years has been our pride.
[2:44:35.600 --> 2:44:42.640]  And I'm not I'm not the guy that sits here and blames everything on boomers or anything like
[2:44:42.640 --> 2:44:49.120]  that. That's not what I'm doing here. But it's just a fact. The boomer generation has had so much
[2:44:49.120 --> 2:44:55.680]  pride in this country. They've never wanted to admit that their generation watched this country die.
[2:44:56.800 --> 2:45:02.800]  They've never wanted to admit that. It's because of their pride. And rightfully so, you're an American.
[2:45:04.800 --> 2:45:10.000]  But but it was that generation that let Bill Clinton rob us dry, the Bushes rob us dry,
[2:45:10.560 --> 2:45:15.360]  that led us to the younger generation electing Obama, who then robbed us dry.
[2:45:15.360 --> 2:45:21.760]  But it was the denial of how bad it was. It was the denial of how bad it really was in this country
[2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:28.080]  that got us to this point. And I'm not just singling out the boomers, but but let's be honest.
[2:45:28.080 --> 2:45:32.080]  I mean, they're the it's that generation, you would bring this up to this. Oh, it's impossible.
[2:45:32.080 --> 2:45:39.040]  That'll never happen here. Here it is. So again, I'm not trying to attack a whole generation of people.
[2:45:39.040 --> 2:45:42.720]  Believe me, I'm a millennial. My generation has its own problems. You know, we think we're like,
[2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:52.080]  you know, fairy unicorns or something. But just in general, it's the denial of how bad it has gotten.
[2:45:52.080 --> 2:45:57.200]  It's the denial that you are no longer in a free country. You are no longer a free man in a free
[2:45:57.200 --> 2:46:03.760]  country. And you know what, you better realize it now. You better realize it now and starting to get
[2:46:03.760 --> 2:46:10.640]  mad and pushing back against this before it's too late. And it's going to be about 27 days
[2:46:10.640 --> 2:46:18.080]  before it's too late. But so Biden receives his vaccine. Fauci receives his vaccine. It's loving
[2:46:18.080 --> 2:46:26.320]  it's the loving needle. If you even believe that, I don't airlines agree to Cuomo request for travelers
[2:46:26.320 --> 2:46:30.720]  to have negative COVID tests before flying from UK amid fear of news train. Here it comes.
[2:46:30.720 --> 2:46:40.400]  Here it comes. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Info wars, those conspiracy theorists, those fake news hacks.
[2:46:40.400 --> 2:46:51.920]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, need a COVID test to fly. Oh, freedom pass to fly. Oh, vaccine to fly.
[2:46:51.920 --> 2:47:01.520]  Oh, vaccine to go back to work. Vaccine to go to school. Oh, RNA messenger RNA vaccine that
[2:47:01.520 --> 2:47:10.320]  rewrites your human genome. Ouch. How's that pride taste? How's that pride taste?
[2:47:10.320 --> 2:47:23.360]  Waffle House CEO calls out the COVID hoax says zero COVID cases in all of their locations.
[2:47:23.360 --> 2:47:35.360]  It's a fake pandemic, man. Info wars headline. Do masked mandates work? New analysis suggests
[2:47:35.360 --> 2:47:45.440]  they don't. No, actually masks spread disease. I know. Go figure. I mean, if you walked around all
[2:47:45.440 --> 2:47:51.200]  day touching at the gas station, touching the pin pad when you check out touching weights at the gym,
[2:47:51.200 --> 2:47:55.440]  we know what touching your car handle, you know, whatever it is. And then you put your hands
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:48:01.840]  and your fingers and your nose and your mouth all day. Do you think you would get sick?
[2:48:01.840 --> 2:48:11.760]  Probably. That's what the mask does. So congratulations. Your mask is spreading COVID.
[2:48:12.800 --> 2:48:22.640]  Good for you. But the murderous governor of New York says if you're Santa at the mall,
[2:48:22.640 --> 2:48:28.560]  you must be wearing a mask and the kids on Santa's lap must wear a mask and everybody must wear a
[2:48:28.560 --> 2:48:35.440]  mask. And coming next, you must have a butt plug to stop COVID farts. The best product, I'm not
[2:48:35.440 --> 2:48:38.480]  supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried turbo force, you need
[2:48:38.480 --> 2:48:43.920]  to try it. I've tried turbo force with everything. Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[2:48:43.920 --> 2:48:48.560]  I put turbo force in my coffee. That was a crazy week. I don't remember sleeping, but as far as
[2:48:48.560 --> 2:48:52.320]  the products go, turbo force is my favorite. And all the info wars products are down to
[2:48:52.320 --> 2:48:56.800]  taking control your life, taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for
[2:48:56.800 --> 2:49:03.040]  you. Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better
[2:49:03.040 --> 2:49:06.880]  life. I'm going to wake up today. You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make
[2:49:06.880 --> 2:49:10.800]  that guy over there healthier, happier and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a
[2:49:10.800 --> 2:49:14.240]  girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone
[2:49:14.240 --> 2:49:17.840]  knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every
[2:49:17.840 --> 2:49:21.760]  single way? There's only one person who woke up and thought that and that was me. I woke up and
[2:49:21.760 --> 2:49:25.200]  thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health.
[2:49:25.200 --> 2:49:28.240]  And that's why you need to go to info wars.com, take control of your health right now and support
[2:49:28.240 --> 2:49:32.400]  the resistance. Don't buy into the group thing. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the turbo force.
[2:49:32.400 --> 2:49:39.520]  Kool-Aid is bad and the turbo force is good. Imagine a dystopic novel or dystopic science
[2:49:39.520 --> 2:49:44.560]  fiction movie where if you've had a cold, you can be locked up in your home, you can be taken away,
[2:49:44.560 --> 2:49:50.320]  you can be forcibly inoculated with drugs that mass greatest vaccines have actually changed your
[2:49:50.320 --> 2:49:55.600]  very DNA. That's where you are in the year 2020. Global government, the United Nations,
[2:49:55.600 --> 2:50:00.560]  all these authoritarian groups admit they're doing it. They even admit that they're doing it for power
[2:50:01.200 --> 2:50:06.720]  and control and that they're not even worried about COVID-19. That's what Klaus Schwab and others
[2:50:06.720 --> 2:50:11.520]  have said. Think about how it's say that as Owen, big tech's got to track you. They've got to trace
[2:50:11.520 --> 2:50:15.840]  you. They've got to control you. You've got to have absolutely your house. You've got to have
[2:50:15.840 --> 2:50:21.280]  secret police come disappear you because my God, this thing has 110 to 1 percent chance of killing
[2:50:21.280 --> 2:50:27.920]  you. Give your ability to have cancer or heart attack. This is their takeover. Imagine on America's
[2:50:27.920 --> 2:50:33.360]  death certificate killed by the fear of the common cold. Yeah, that's fair monitoring. That's mind
[2:50:33.360 --> 2:50:50.240]  control. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Transmitting worldwide from the summit.new
[2:50:50.240 --> 2:50:56.000]  studios in the United Kingdom. You're listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:04.720]  Hello, everybody. Welcome back. It is the summit news hour with me, your host Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:51:04.720 --> 2:51:10.640]  I hope you're all having a good preparation for Christmas. My Christmas has been completely
[2:51:10.640 --> 2:51:17.920]  ruined and now I'm trapped here on what is being referred to as Plague Island. Yes, it was racist
[2:51:17.920 --> 2:51:23.440]  to call it the China virus. It was racist to suggest that we should stop incoming flights
[2:51:23.440 --> 2:51:29.120]  from China back in March. That was bigoted. That was xenophobic. That was horrific.
[2:51:29.120 --> 2:51:35.040]  But it's perfectly fine to ban British people from dozens of countries around the world
[2:51:35.040 --> 2:51:43.600]  and refer to the British Isles as Plague Island. So I am indeed trapped alone on Plague Island for
[2:51:43.600 --> 2:51:51.120]  Christmas. It's going to be another fun one. And the reason for that is because on Saturday afternoon,
[2:51:51.120 --> 2:51:57.520]  our esteemed Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that London and the southeast of England would be
[2:51:57.520 --> 2:52:04.720]  placed into what they refer to as tier four. Of course, that's just another name for complete and
[2:52:04.720 --> 2:52:11.600]  total lockdown. They banned not only people traveling outside their immediate area, they banned
[2:52:11.600 --> 2:52:18.880]  all international travel. So now basically I'm banned from traveling 30 or 40 miles to the next
[2:52:18.880 --> 2:52:25.120]  tier down. That's illegal. So if you've got family, if you've got granny 30 miles away, you can't go
[2:52:25.120 --> 2:52:30.400]  and visit her. That's illegal. You may get stopped by the police. You may get fined. You may even get
[2:52:30.400 --> 2:52:38.320]  arrested. You can't travel internationally because they ban you domestically from doing so. And in
[2:52:38.320 --> 2:52:43.200]  dozens of different countries now they're banning people from Britain being allowed into those
[2:52:43.200 --> 2:52:50.080]  countries. That's all illegal. But you know what isn't illegal? Flights landing from Africa,
[2:52:50.080 --> 2:52:56.640]  Brazil, China, and every other country on the planet landing at London airports. These people
[2:52:56.640 --> 2:53:02.320]  from China, Brazil, Africa, Brazil, by the way, over seven million coronavirus cases.
[2:53:03.200 --> 2:53:09.120]  This new strain, the mutant strain that we're all supposed to be terrified of, was found in
[2:53:09.120 --> 2:53:15.600]  Brazil eight months ago. But those people are allowed to come here. In fact, multiple flights
[2:53:15.600 --> 2:53:21.920]  from Sao Paulo, Brazil, landing basically every half an hour at Heathrow Airport, Gatwick Airport.
[2:53:21.920 --> 2:53:25.840]  Those people are allowed to come here, even though they've got record coronavirus cases,
[2:53:25.840 --> 2:53:30.800]  even though they've got the new mutant strain and had it eight months ago. They can come here.
[2:53:30.800 --> 2:53:37.360]  But because Boris Johnson has literally set up internal borders while leaving the external
[2:53:37.360 --> 2:53:45.360]  borders wide open, I'm not allowed to travel 20, 30 miles away to see family in a different tier.
[2:53:46.240 --> 2:53:51.920]  We literally have internal borders. And I mean, they're just taking the piss at this point. They're
[2:53:51.920 --> 2:53:57.600]  taking the piss. We have flights landing. I hear them every five minutes overhead that Heathrow
[2:53:57.600 --> 2:54:04.080]  Airport from every other country in the world. But if I go to Brighton, if I go 40, 50 miles away,
[2:54:04.080 --> 2:54:10.800]  I face arrests and fines. That's the situation. Again, because of this new mutant strain,
[2:54:10.800 --> 2:54:15.920]  which they're claiming is new, which isn't new, it's already in Europe. It was in Brazil eight
[2:54:15.920 --> 2:54:20.880]  months ago. Now you have top scientists, you have a top German virologist, which we're going to get
[2:54:20.880 --> 2:54:26.000]  into on the other side of the break, saying that they weren't even informed of this new strain.
[2:54:26.000 --> 2:54:31.920]  There are literally 300 different strains of coronavirus. It was announced on a press conference,
[2:54:31.920 --> 2:54:38.720]  literally putting tens of millions of people on the eve of Christmas under de facto house arrest,
[2:54:38.720 --> 2:54:46.640]  ruining their Christmas plans, and then prompting this mass travel ban in Spain, Germany, France,
[2:54:46.640 --> 2:54:51.680]  and all these other countries from Brits trying to enter other countries to visit their family
[2:54:51.680 --> 2:54:56.480]  members. Oh, and by the way, if you've booked a flight, which many people have, their Christmas
[2:54:56.480 --> 2:55:01.680]  plans are already completely ruined. But not only that, they're not even going to get refunds
[2:55:01.680 --> 2:55:06.480]  on the flights. The flight operators are still operating the flights because maybe
[2:55:07.200 --> 2:55:13.200]  two Spanish people are going home from London back to Spain. So rather than cancel the flights and
[2:55:13.200 --> 2:55:17.920]  have to give people their refunds, they're going to still operate all the flights, even though
[2:55:17.920 --> 2:55:24.400]  there'll be 95% empty. And when people complained about this to the government, they said, there's
[2:55:24.400 --> 2:55:30.080]  nothing whatsoever we can do about it. So they were screwed by Boris because their Christmas plans
[2:55:30.080 --> 2:55:34.640]  were ruined. They're not going to see their family. And now they're being screwed by the airlines
[2:55:34.640 --> 2:55:38.320]  because they're not going to get their refunds. We'll get into that more on the other side.
[2:55:38.320 --> 2:55:40.000]  Summit.News. Go away.
[2:55:43.200 --> 2:55:49.520]  Winter sun has been sold out for months. It's now back in stock. It's the highest quality vitamin D
[2:55:49.520 --> 2:55:54.240]  three you're going to find anywhere. You take it out of the tongue for maximum absorption or just
[2:55:54.240 --> 2:55:58.640]  put it in your mouth and drink it down. It's absolutely an essential vitamin, meaning if you
[2:55:58.640 --> 2:56:03.360]  don't have it and you have a deficiency from it, you will die. The system doesn't want you to know
[2:56:03.360 --> 2:56:07.200]  this. And they don't want you to know that they've lowered the allowance of what they claim you need
[2:56:07.200 --> 2:56:12.000]  every day to a level that makes you very, very sickly and easy to control. But now we have winter
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:16.160]  sun with vitamin D three and vitamin K that helps it upload better. And it's also excellent for your
[2:56:16.160 --> 2:56:23.200]  immune system at infowarstore.com sold out for months. I'm still going to sell it at 50% off
[2:56:23.200 --> 2:56:27.280]  because everyone needs it. Get it for yourself, get it for your husband, your wife, your children,
[2:56:27.280 --> 2:56:32.000]  your neighbors, especially folks that work indoors and don't get any sun. It's absolutely critical
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:38.240]  to get your winter sun now available again at infowarstore.com. Again, winter sun at infowarstore.com
[2:56:38.240 --> 2:56:50.720]  is back in stock. Merry Christmas. You're listening to the summit dot news radio hour with Paul Joseph
[2:56:50.720 --> 2:57:00.320]  Watson. So we have a situation in the United Kingdom where the pubs are closed, Christmas is
[2:57:00.320 --> 2:57:05.360]  canceled, people's plans have been completely ruined. They're not going to see their family members.
[2:57:05.360 --> 2:57:12.720]  But guess what? The borders, the external borders at least are going to remain wide open to anyone
[2:57:12.720 --> 2:57:18.240]  who wants to enter this country. I can't travel 30 miles away because I face fines and arrests
[2:57:18.240 --> 2:57:26.080]  because I'm in tier four, and I can't go to tier three. But if people from Shanghai, Beijing,
[2:57:26.800 --> 2:57:32.880]  Sao Paulo, or Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya want to visit the United Kingdom and visit London,
[2:57:32.880 --> 2:57:37.520]  they're perfectly free to do so. In what world does that make any sense?
[2:57:38.400 --> 2:57:44.240]  Flights from Africa, Brazil and China continue to land at Heathrow, even as Londoners are banned
[2:57:44.240 --> 2:57:49.600]  from travel. Flights from countries all over the world, including COVID-19 hotspots like Brazil,
[2:57:49.600 --> 2:57:54.400]  continue to land at London airports despite Londoners themselves being banned by law
[2:57:55.440 --> 2:58:02.480]  from traveling outside the area. If you want to go on Flight Aware, the Flight Aware website,
[2:58:03.040 --> 2:58:09.280]  and zero in on London, and then go a little bit west where you'll find Heathrow Airport,
[2:58:09.280 --> 2:58:14.320]  you can click on all the planes, you can see where they're coming from, where they're going to,
[2:58:14.320 --> 2:58:19.920]  they're coming from Kenya, they're coming from Sao Paulo, they're coming from Beijing,
[2:58:19.920 --> 2:58:23.440]  they're coming from everywhere. They can get in but we can't get out.
[2:58:23.440 --> 2:58:25.920]  Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Saturday,
[2:58:26.960 --> 2:58:30.240]  London and the Southeast of England would be placed under a new lockdown tier four,
[2:58:30.240 --> 2:58:35.680]  making it illegal for Londoners to travel outside the region. He also revealed that people living
[2:58:35.680 --> 2:58:39.040]  in tier four areas would be banned from international travel, forcing millions of
[2:58:39.040 --> 2:58:43.280]  Brits who plan to visit family abroad to cancel their Christmas. And who knows when we'll be
[2:58:43.280 --> 2:58:50.240]  allowed to travel again, and if we'll be allowed to travel without the vaccine. Even to get to Spain,
[2:58:50.240 --> 2:58:54.480]  and now this is already being introduced by numerous of the European countries,
[2:58:54.480 --> 2:59:01.440]  you had to get a COVID test, a PCR test and prove it was negative simply to get into Spain.
[2:59:01.440 --> 2:59:06.960]  And of course we know these PCR tests are notoriously unreliable, they produce false positives
[2:59:08.240 --> 2:59:14.000]  repeatedly, they're totally unreliable. So you could not have COVID whatsoever,
[2:59:14.000 --> 2:59:18.720]  we've had people taking these tests who have had COVID six weeks ago,
[2:59:19.680 --> 2:59:24.720]  they've completely recovered six weeks to two months later, they take the PCR test and it says
[2:59:24.720 --> 2:59:32.080]  they still got COVID. And that's the thin end of the wedge. Next it'll be if you don't have the
[2:59:32.080 --> 2:59:36.960]  vaccine passport, which initially they denied they were even planning, now they're literally
[2:59:36.960 --> 2:59:41.680]  planning it in government documents to enter other countries. And we got more on that
[2:59:42.640 --> 2:59:47.680]  in terms of France and Germany talking about banning people who don't have the vaccine from
[2:59:47.680 --> 2:59:52.160]  using public transport and entering other venues and in fact being denied medical
[2:59:52.160 --> 2:59:59.680]  care altogether. I'm going to get onto that later on in the show. But this article continues,
[2:59:59.680 --> 3:00:04.080]  while Londoners are not allowed to hop on a flight, plain loads full of foreign visitors
[3:00:04.080 --> 3:00:08.960]  continue to land at Heathrow and other major airports in the region. Two days after Londoners
[3:00:08.960 --> 3:00:14.720]  were banned from travel, a flight from Nairobi, Kenya landed at Heathrow. Oh, that's obviously
[3:00:14.720 --> 3:00:20.560]  very crucially important that we import Kenyans during the height of a pandemic,
[3:00:20.560 --> 3:00:26.560]  that's crucial. We can't stop that from happening. That's really important, isn't it?
[3:00:26.560 --> 3:00:30.560]  Flights from China, the original source of the coronavirus also continue to land
[3:00:30.560 --> 3:00:37.360]  in London on a regular basis. Yesterday no less than five flights from Brazil arrived at Heathrow
[3:00:37.360 --> 3:00:45.840]  Airport despite their country registering over 7 million COVID-19 cases. And then we get on to
[3:00:45.840 --> 3:00:51.520]  the reason behind all this. The reason why Prime Minister Boris Johnson has literally
[3:00:51.520 --> 3:00:57.360]  created internal borders within the United Kingdom while leaving the external borders wide open.
[3:00:58.400 --> 3:01:02.480]  In fact, we have another article here, video pictures. British travellers held against their
[3:01:02.480 --> 3:01:09.280]  will at German airports. Chaos unfolded in the UK with the government touting an unverified
[3:01:09.280 --> 3:01:16.720]  mutant strain of code. There are literally 200 different strains, literally 200 or more.
[3:01:17.680 --> 3:01:23.120]  It's not even at more, it's not more harmful than the original one. But this is the excuse
[3:01:23.760 --> 3:01:28.560]  to justify a fresh lockdown video has emerged of British travellers being heard at inside foreign
[3:01:28.560 --> 3:01:32.880]  airports and held against their will. The footage shows health officials and nurses,
[3:01:32.880 --> 3:01:38.960]  some in full hazmat gear and administering immediate COVID-19 tests as passengers plead,
[3:01:39.600 --> 3:01:46.000]  please help us leave. So they introduced these COVID tests as mandatory measure to be allowed
[3:01:46.000 --> 3:01:50.880]  to get into the country on a whim while people were literally still in the air on these planes.
[3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:58.560]  Oh, and by the way, that cost another £200 to go and get a COVID test, a PCR test that
[3:01:58.560 --> 3:02:04.720]  isn't even reliable. So a lot of these people who have family in Spain, in France, in all these
[3:02:04.720 --> 3:02:08.480]  other countries, not only are they not going to get their money back on the flight, because they're
[3:02:08.480 --> 3:02:15.280]  still operating the flights, even though they're completely empty, Ryanair in particular. They've
[3:02:15.280 --> 3:02:22.800]  also shelled out £200 over $200 on these PCR tests, which are now completely redundant, because
[3:02:22.800 --> 3:02:28.400]  they're literally banned from leaving the country. And even if they're managed to leave the country,
[3:02:28.400 --> 3:02:32.720]  somehow, they're banned from getting into Spain and France and Germany and these other countries.
[3:02:33.680 --> 3:02:39.360]  So as quoting here, we are at Hanover Airport and we are held against our will. We were tested
[3:02:39.360 --> 3:02:42.720]  and were prohibited from leaving the premises while awaiting the results.
[3:02:44.240 --> 3:02:49.120]  Hanover health official Andreas Kranz told German Newswire DPA that quote,
[3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:53.680]  our aim is to prevent the new variant of the virus from entering the region. It's already in the
[3:02:53.680 --> 3:03:00.880]  region. It's spread throughout Europe. It was in Brazil eight months ago. How is it not in Europe
[3:03:00.880 --> 3:03:07.200]  when you've got planes landing from Brazil every half an hour? It's a complete myth that this
[3:03:07.200 --> 3:03:13.040]  mutant strain only exists in the United Kingdom, but apparently now we're Plague Island and that's
[3:03:13.040 --> 3:03:17.920]  okay to refer to Britain as Plague Island. Don't call it the China virus though, that means you're
[3:03:17.920 --> 3:03:26.640]  racist. Another headline here at summit.news. Scientists MPs ask, where is evidence of 70%
[3:03:26.640 --> 3:03:32.160]  more contagious mutant COVID? As London and the entire southeast of the UK was plunged into a
[3:03:32.160 --> 3:03:36.960]  fresh lockdown over the weekend, scores of countries have banned all travel to and from the UK. But
[3:03:36.960 --> 3:03:42.960]  scientists there are demanding to see any evidence that there is a 70% more contagious mutant strain
[3:03:42.960 --> 3:03:49.280]  of COVID having not been shown anything by the government. They just announced it in a press
[3:03:49.280 --> 3:03:55.840]  conference and that's enough apparently. The Daily Mail reports, Carl Hennigan, Professor of
[3:03:55.840 --> 3:04:02.320]  Evidence-based Medicine at Oxford University, has expressed skepticism over the 70% figure.
[3:04:03.200 --> 3:04:08.320]  He says, I've been doing this job for 25 years. I can tell you, you can't establish a quantifiable
[3:04:08.320 --> 3:04:13.920]  number in such a short time frame. They didn't even open it up to the other scientists. They just
[3:04:13.920 --> 3:04:19.280]  announced it in a press conference because they needed to get everyone under de facto house arrest
[3:04:19.280 --> 3:04:27.120]  right before Christmas. After having initially, of course, said that graciously giving us a four-day
[3:04:27.120 --> 3:04:35.600]  period from the 23rd of October, I think it was, to the 27th, where we would be allowed.
[3:04:35.600 --> 3:04:42.240]  And we were so grateful. We would be allowed to meet with people from not one, but two other
[3:04:42.240 --> 3:04:49.680]  households. My God, can you imagine being allowed by the government to meet up with family members
[3:04:49.680 --> 3:04:57.920]  from two different households? We were so graciously, graciously thankful. And now that's gone as well.
[3:04:57.920 --> 3:05:02.320]  To your four, you can't even meet with anyone. You're literally under house arrest. You can't
[3:05:02.320 --> 3:05:07.280]  leave the area. But people from Beijing and Shanghai, they can come in. They can do whatever
[3:05:07.280 --> 3:05:14.400]  they want. Borders are wide open. So, Hennigan continued speaking about this mutant strain,
[3:05:14.400 --> 3:05:19.280]  which isn't new at all and has existed for at least eight months. He says, every expert is
[3:05:19.280 --> 3:05:24.080]  saying it's too early to draw such an inference. I would want to have very clear evidence rather
[3:05:24.080 --> 3:05:30.000]  than we think it's more transmissible so we can see if it is or not. He said it's had massive
[3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:36.080]  implications. It's causing fear and panic. Yeah, that was the reason why they came out with it,
[3:05:36.080 --> 3:05:39.280]  but we should not be in this situation where the government is putting out data that is
[3:05:39.280 --> 3:05:48.080]  unquantifiable. They are fitting the data to the evidence, which is what they've done all along.
[3:05:49.600 --> 3:05:56.160]  Another top scientist calling out this mutant strain, RT reports, top German virologist cast
[3:05:56.160 --> 3:06:02.880]  doubt on fears of new highly contagious UK COVID-19 strain. This is from Christian Drosten,
[3:06:02.880 --> 3:06:08.160]  the head of virology department of Berlin's Charite Center. He said, suddenly there is this
[3:06:08.160 --> 3:06:13.440]  figure out there 70 percent and no one even knows what is meant by that. The virologist believes
[3:06:13.440 --> 3:06:18.720]  there is just not enough data to really say that the new strain is any more dangerous than the
[3:06:18.720 --> 3:06:23.920]  existing ones. But it doesn't matter what he says. It doesn't matter what the other scientists say.
[3:06:23.920 --> 3:06:26.880]  They just announced it in a press conference and now because of this,
[3:06:27.840 --> 3:06:34.320]  we're going to be locked down until Easter or beyond. Lockdown 3.0, which is going to lead to
[3:06:34.320 --> 3:06:41.600]  lockdown 4.0 ad infinitum. It never ends because they don't want it. We'll be right back summit.News.

[3:09:15.120 --> 3:09:17.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:09:17.760 --> 3:09:33.280]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[3:09:35.280 --> 3:09:40.400]  We are back broadcasting live from what they are now referring to as Plague Island,
[3:09:40.400 --> 3:09:44.880]  because we're all in prison and trapped within it. And apparently it's all because of this
[3:09:44.880 --> 3:09:52.160]  mutant new strain of coronavirus that isn't new at all, and in fact was in Brazil eight months ago.
[3:09:52.160 --> 3:09:57.680]  Headline reports UK infection rate lower than countries cutting it off,
[3:09:57.680 --> 3:10:03.280]  mutant COVID was seen in Brazil eight months ago. And this is nothing more than xenophobia
[3:10:03.280 --> 3:10:09.200]  against Britain and against Brits. Despite nations all over the world beginning to isolate from the
[3:10:09.200 --> 3:10:15.840]  UK, banning travel to and from Britain, Britain not banning any travel whatsoever that's incoming
[3:10:15.840 --> 3:10:20.400]  from China and Brazil, and effectively cutting it off, the infection rate is lower there than
[3:10:20.400 --> 3:10:25.200]  several other countries. As noted by the Daily Mail, infection rates in Britain are still lower
[3:10:25.200 --> 3:10:30.000]  than in Sweden, Denmark, Croatia, and Holland. Nevertheless, these countries are isolating
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:35.360]  themselves from the UK, very xenophobic, very racist. After the government there hyped a mutant
[3:10:35.360 --> 3:10:41.600]  strain of COVID to justify another lockdown without presenting any evidence. That's not me
[3:10:41.600 --> 3:10:46.160]  saying that as top virologists and scientists saying that. Footage has emerged of British
[3:10:46.160 --> 3:10:50.480]  travellers being detained in foreign airports, talked about that before the break. Meanwhile,
[3:10:50.480 --> 3:10:56.560]  the British government has not closed its borders to any incoming flights at all. All these other
[3:10:56.560 --> 3:11:00.800]  countries have closed their borders even though they've got literally higher coronavirus rates
[3:11:00.800 --> 3:11:06.560]  than the UK. Scientists working with the government in Britain also claim that the new
[3:11:06.560 --> 3:11:13.040]  supercharged strain was present in Brazil eight months ago. So even the scientists advising the
[3:11:13.040 --> 3:11:19.520]  British government which is claiming this mutant strain is new are saying it is a new. Studies
[3:11:19.520 --> 3:11:27.120]  show the mutation called N501Y was spotted in the South American country in April before later
[3:11:27.120 --> 3:11:32.000]  rearing its head again in Australia and the United States. That's according to the London
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:38.000]  Telegraph and it's also across Europe. It's already in these same countries that banning travel
[3:11:38.720 --> 3:11:42.640]  based on the fact that it's a new strain. When it isn't a new strain, it's already throughout the
[3:11:42.640 --> 3:11:49.200]  world. The report further notes that leading scientific advisors explain the N501Y strain
[3:11:49.200 --> 3:11:54.640]  did not cause much alarm earlier in the year because it failed to rip through populations on its own.
[3:11:54.640 --> 3:12:02.240]  And yet they're telling us that it's 70% worse than the original COVID strain. The strain is
[3:12:02.240 --> 3:12:07.360]  thought to have been spreading in the UK since September but only now days before Christmas
[3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:12.400]  and after Parliament has broken up for the holiday as the government spoken about it. And they did
[3:12:12.400 --> 3:12:17.600]  that. They sent all the MPs back home so they couldn't come back to Parliament and challenged
[3:12:17.600 --> 3:12:23.120]  the government, forced them into holding a vote on this new tier system. Because this tier system
[3:12:23.120 --> 3:12:28.240]  was introduced on the basis that Parliament would have a vote on it. Imagine that our own
[3:12:28.240 --> 3:12:35.760]  elected officials, our own elected MPs having a say on law. Imagine that. That's crazy, right?
[3:12:36.880 --> 3:12:41.760]  But no, they all sent them packing. They sent them back home. Then afterwards introduce this
[3:12:42.400 --> 3:12:47.200]  law on the hoof on a whim so it couldn't be challenged in Parliament.
[3:12:47.200 --> 3:12:52.720]  Scientists in Britain also state the hint to look for the N501Y came from scientists who were
[3:12:52.720 --> 3:12:58.320]  tracking this mutation in South Africa. So it was already in South Africa too. Both the British
[3:12:58.320 --> 3:13:03.600]  and South African variants. By the way, people from South Africa, they're totally welcome to come in.
[3:13:04.160 --> 3:13:09.600]  I've seen flights from South Africa landing at Heathrow too where they have the same strain.
[3:13:09.600 --> 3:13:17.360]  But I can't travel 30 miles or I might be arrested. But it appeared to evolve independently of one
[3:13:17.360 --> 3:13:22.000]  another. South Africa's Health Minister suggested on Friday that the new strain present there seems
[3:13:22.000 --> 3:13:27.920]  to have a more severe effect on young people. But again, come on in. Scientists independent
[3:13:27.920 --> 3:13:33.760]  of the government are asking to see the evidence. We talked about that before the break. Professor
[3:13:33.760 --> 3:13:38.720]  Carl Hennigan said, I've been doing this job for 25 years. I can tell you you can't establish a
[3:13:38.720 --> 3:13:46.400]  quantifiable number in such a short time frame. So it's all baloney. What's also baloney is the
[3:13:46.400 --> 3:13:52.160]  notion that police can even enforce any of this. We've seen polls which I'm going to get into shortly
[3:13:52.960 --> 3:13:59.680]  which show massive support for lockdown measures. The worst they get, the support seems to just
[3:13:59.680 --> 3:14:04.880]  grow. I don't know who they're asking in these polls because anecdotally that's not what I'm
[3:14:04.880 --> 3:14:12.240]  seeing witnessing or experiencing out in the real world. You go in the barbers, you go in pubs when
[3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:17.280]  we were allowed to, you go in restaurants. Everybody's talking about this and everybody's
[3:14:17.280 --> 3:14:22.960]  speaking out against it. There was a woman in the pub literally telling half the pub how
[3:14:22.960 --> 3:14:29.920]  she works in an NHS hospital and they're completely empty. And we're going to get onto that too.
[3:14:29.920 --> 3:14:35.680]  But here's a headline, UK police, there are no powers to enforce Christmas travel ban. Police
[3:14:35.680 --> 3:14:40.240]  in the UK have admitted they have no legal authority to enforce a travel ban in and out of
[3:14:40.240 --> 3:14:44.960]  London and the Southeast after the government instituted a third lockdown, cancelling Christmas
[3:14:44.960 --> 3:14:50.960]  for millions of people. The London Telegraph reports, officials from the police federation
[3:14:50.960 --> 3:14:57.520]  say officers do not have the power to stop people traveling to or to stop cars and check if citizens
[3:14:57.520 --> 3:15:02.640]  are unlawfully visiting relatives and friends for Christmas. Now, of course, we had pretty
[3:15:02.640 --> 3:15:09.120]  patell the Home Secretary come out last week and say police should enforce these measures,
[3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:14.080]  which would bring the prospect of them literally knocking on people's doors on Christmas Day
[3:15:14.080 --> 3:15:19.200]  to see if there were too many people gathering in one place. So the government has literally
[3:15:19.200 --> 3:15:24.080]  encouraged people to spy on each other, to snitch on each other. And yet the police force itself
[3:15:24.080 --> 3:15:30.560]  across the country saying they're not going to enforce it because they can't. This police chief
[3:15:30.560 --> 3:15:34.560]  said it's heavily reliant on public compliance, the restriction isn't on traveling, it's on
[3:15:34.560 --> 3:15:40.080]  leaving the house. That's what police source told the Telegraph. He said, the more reasonable
[3:15:40.080 --> 3:15:44.000]  excuses there are, the more there will be opportunities to claim an exemption where in
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:49.760]  truth one doesn't exist. Because again, in the law, if they challenge you and say, why are you
[3:15:49.760 --> 3:15:56.640]  outside your house pleb, legally, you're not obliged to tell them. So it's completely toothless.
[3:15:57.840 --> 3:16:03.360]  In addition, it's only legal for police to stop motorists if they have witnessed a traffic violation.
[3:16:03.360 --> 3:16:07.200]  Now, that being said, we have seen videos that was won a couple of weeks ago,
[3:16:08.000 --> 3:16:16.160]  where it was an Elvis impersonator literally in his in his home on his own doing karaoke to an
[3:16:16.160 --> 3:16:22.880]  Elvis song. His back is turned to the door. The police bust in. He thinks he's being robbed. He
[3:16:22.880 --> 3:16:28.080]  thinks it's an intruder. He literally goes and tries to attack the police, obviously because
[3:16:28.080 --> 3:16:33.920]  one of his neighbors snitched on him because the music was too loud. So you are going to get a lot
[3:16:33.920 --> 3:16:39.120]  of that. You're going to get a lot of curtain twitches over the Christmas and New Year period,
[3:16:39.120 --> 3:16:46.320]  reporting their neighbors to the police because the government literally encouraged them to do that.
[3:16:46.320 --> 3:16:52.960]  You see the Elvis impersonator, the COVID police force, the COVID inspectors just burst into his
[3:16:52.960 --> 3:16:58.320]  house. No warrant whatsoever. He tries to attack them, not realizing that it's the police and not
[3:16:58.320 --> 3:17:03.360]  an intruder. And you're going to see more of that over the next week, because you're going to have
[3:17:03.360 --> 3:17:07.920]  New Year's Eve. They've banned, you know, all the pubs are closed for tens of millions of people.
[3:17:07.920 --> 3:17:11.520]  People are being told they're not allowed to gather even with their own friends and family.
[3:17:11.520 --> 3:17:15.920]  Do you really think they're going to abide by that? In fact, there was a poll a few weeks ago,
[3:17:16.720 --> 3:17:20.800]  or in fact, I think it was a couple of months ago, which found that although the majority,
[3:17:20.800 --> 3:17:26.960]  the vast majority of people agree in the polls, they say they consent to these lockdown measures,
[3:17:26.960 --> 3:17:31.360]  when they were asked to be honest about if they've actually complied with them personally,
[3:17:31.360 --> 3:17:37.600]  only 18% said they had. So of course, there's mass noncompliance. Of course, you're going to get
[3:17:37.600 --> 3:17:45.120]  people in their dozens, in some cases, or at least groups of 10, 15 people going to each other's
[3:17:45.120 --> 3:17:51.840]  houses on New Year's Eve for massive house parties. Now the question remains, are the police going
[3:17:51.840 --> 3:17:56.960]  to break those up? Because you can be damn sure that they are going to be thousands upon thousands
[3:17:56.960 --> 3:18:03.760]  of house parties across the country on New Year's Eve in violation of this ridiculous
[3:18:03.760 --> 3:18:08.480]  law. Will the police go on? Will the batsman go on and so on?
[3:18:11.520 --> 3:18:17.920]  Anybody listening to my voice and simply searching in the term, Devo's group, technocracy, or technocrats,
[3:18:18.800 --> 3:18:26.320]  you will get Klaus Schwab and Sean Codd, Yunker, and all the new world order globalists by Gigi
[3:18:26.320 --> 3:18:32.240]  Pink saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments, that they want businessman
[3:18:32.240 --> 3:18:36.720]  technocrats over. And that's who Klaus Schwab is. You might want to look into the guy that says
[3:18:36.720 --> 3:18:41.680]  they've watched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor. You might want to find out
[3:18:41.680 --> 3:18:47.280]  who this supervillain is. You see, he believes because he's hitting it playing you and you're
[3:18:47.280 --> 3:18:50.800]  not speaking out against it that he has the right to do it to you. You might want to find who he
[3:18:50.800 --> 3:18:56.240]  works for. He works directly for Prince Charles. He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global
[3:18:56.240 --> 3:19:02.800]  sustainability. That means worldwide neo feudalism in his own works. So you might want to find out
[3:19:02.800 --> 3:19:07.200]  how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you before you take those shots. You might just
[3:19:07.200 --> 3:19:14.640]  want to find out who this villain is. All right. Christmas 2020 is here, but we'll soon be gone.
[3:19:15.440 --> 3:19:21.120]  But I want to encourage all of you to recommit the year 2020, and I'm talking to myself when I say this,

[3:21:13.280 --> 3:21:16.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:21:23.920 --> 3:21:28.400]  you're listening to summit.news with Paul Joseph Watson
[3:21:28.400 --> 3:21:39.120]  so in the United Kingdom we have officially now internal borders while the external borders remain
[3:21:39.120 --> 3:21:46.240]  wide open and all for what the amount of deaths year on year in the United Kingdom is roughly the
[3:21:46.240 --> 3:21:53.840]  same as it's been for the past five 10 years. In fact the 2017 to 18 flu season claimed more
[3:21:53.840 --> 3:22:01.200]  deaths year on year than this current season 2019 to 2020. Now we have this headline out of the mail
[3:22:01.200 --> 3:22:07.360]  online our hospitals really creaking under the strain of COVID before Christmas the hospitals
[3:22:07.360 --> 3:22:16.400]  are emptier right now compared to this same time last year. Last year they were 90 full now they're
[3:22:16.400 --> 3:22:24.720]  only 85 full the article states this is based on official data by the way NHS data still shows
[3:22:24.720 --> 3:22:30.000]  hospitals to be quieter than they were this time last year compared to this time last year amid
[3:22:30.000 --> 3:22:34.880]  the looming threat of a third national lockdown in the new year despite the health service having
[3:22:34.880 --> 3:22:39.840]  more breathing room than 12 months ago Boris Johnson refused to rule out another national
[3:22:39.840 --> 3:22:44.880]  shutdown and that's going to happen by the way. January the whole country is going to be shut
[3:22:44.880 --> 3:22:52.640]  down again figures show there were 15,465 people in hospital with COVID in England on December 16th
[3:22:53.440 --> 3:23:00.240]  compared to 18,974 on the worst day in spring. Now November's lockdown effects appear to have worn
[3:23:00.240 --> 3:23:06.160]  off oh yeah there were there were more infections before the lockdown than after the lockdown sorry
[3:23:06.160 --> 3:23:11.360]  after the lockdown than before the lockdown in London the lockdown didn't work so now we have
[3:23:11.360 --> 3:23:15.600]  another one and then another one and then another one because these lockdowns work so well.
[3:23:17.040 --> 3:23:22.240]  Article continues and more confirmation the number 10 is struggling to keep a lid on the
[3:23:22.240 --> 3:23:28.240]  epidemic stage today claimed Britain's COVID-19 reproduction R8 is definitely above one again
[3:23:28.240 --> 3:23:32.960]  but statistics suggest the health service is overall coping better with its workload than it
[3:23:32.960 --> 3:23:40.960]  did last winter before this pandemic was even a thing. A greater proportion of ward beds are free
[3:23:40.960 --> 3:23:46.720]  intensive care units have more room and A&E departments aren't yet turning ambulances away
[3:23:46.720 --> 3:23:54.160]  more often than usual with the exception of a bad day at one NHS trust in the Midlands. Meanwhile
[3:23:54.160 --> 3:23:59.840]  of course they're canceling all the both elective procedures and serious treatments
[3:24:00.800 --> 3:24:04.720]  cancers in the life so people aren't getting access to their cancer treatments either because
[3:24:04.720 --> 3:24:09.680]  they're afraid to go into the hospitals because they've been so terrified by the mainstream media
[3:24:09.680 --> 3:24:15.680]  or because those treatments those operations are being cancelled so more excess deaths from that
[3:24:15.680 --> 3:24:20.720]  they don't even take that into account when they make these policies and the occupancy figure does
[3:24:20.720 --> 3:24:27.440]  not take into account bolstered capacity at the mothballed Nightingale hospitals of course just
[3:24:27.440 --> 3:24:33.200]  like you have the Navy ship cruising into New York at the height of the pandemic back in spring
[3:24:34.080 --> 3:24:38.320]  which was almost immediately immediately turned away because they didn't need it
[3:24:38.320 --> 3:24:42.240]  we had all these temporary Nightingale hospitals built in the United Kingdom
[3:24:43.680 --> 3:24:50.800]  and almost to to every single one of them they were not used the NHS is also benefiting from
[3:24:50.800 --> 3:24:56.960]  record levels of staff so they're completely not overwhelmed there's a graph here on this article
[3:24:57.760 --> 3:25:05.280]  it says how does NHS pressure compare to 2019 average percentage of beds occupied in 2019
[3:25:05.280 --> 3:25:15.840]  December last year 94.9 percent right now 2020 89 percent so it's less occupancy the hospitals
[3:25:15.840 --> 3:25:22.000]  are emptier right now than they were last year and yet we're being presented with this hysterical
[3:25:22.000 --> 3:25:28.560]  notion the hospitals being overwhelmed the people are going to be dying in corridors it's simply not
[3:25:28.560 --> 3:25:37.280]  happening pretended percentage of intensive care beds full in 2019 December this term last year
[3:25:37.280 --> 3:25:47.520]  it was 83.8 percent right now 2020 it's only 75 percent and those numbers are direct from the NHS
[3:25:49.840 --> 3:25:54.800]  by the way somebody worked it out on lockdownskeptics.org which is an excellent website tracking all this
[3:25:54.800 --> 3:26:01.840]  that the chances of you or at least if you live in the United Kingdom it's probably similar in the
[3:26:01.840 --> 3:26:08.160]  United States the chances of you being infected with COVID passing it on to somebody else and
[3:26:08.160 --> 3:26:13.440]  then dying from it you know this whole thing about all you're so irresponsible for killing granny
[3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:19.520]  the chances of that happening somebody worked out and I'm going to go through the numbers here
[3:26:19.520 --> 3:26:28.000]  are the same chances of you winning the lottery it's that rare so first of all given that you
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:33.520]  have no symptoms what are the chances that you're infected with COVID the Office of National
[3:26:33.520 --> 3:26:41.520]  Statistics in the UK estimates this to be one in 115 or 0.87 percent now imagining you are
[3:26:41.520 --> 3:26:45.760]  infected but you don't have any symptoms what's the probability you will infect somebody else
[3:26:45.760 --> 3:26:53.680]  with COVID recent studies show this is around 0.7 percent so as if we multiply the probability
[3:26:53.680 --> 3:26:59.520]  of these two events we can calculate the likelihood of you A being infected and B passing that
[3:26:59.520 --> 3:27:08.240]  infection on without symptoms this gives a figure of 0.006 percent to put that figure into context
[3:27:08.240 --> 3:27:13.920]  it's roughly the same as your chance of dying in a car crash over the course of any given year
[3:27:13.920 --> 3:27:19.760]  incredibly rare but if you infect someone this doesn't mean they're going to end up dying of
[3:27:19.760 --> 3:27:25.840]  COVID pneumonia far from it in fact there's a lot of debate regarding the IFR of SARS COVID
[3:27:26.720 --> 3:27:32.880]  but the Center for Evidence based medicine puts it at roughly 0.5 percent now if we multiply the
[3:27:32.880 --> 3:27:38.400]  chance of infecting another person without symptoms by the fatality rate we can estimate
[3:27:38.400 --> 3:27:47.680]  that the risk of killing one of your relatives is roughly and bear with me here 0.003 percent
[3:27:48.240 --> 3:27:55.520]  or 1 in 3 million that's the risk obviously there are a lot of caveats if one of your relatives is
[3:27:55.520 --> 3:28:01.040]  very old and very ill and that's going to be a higher risk if they're relatively healthy it's
[3:28:01.040 --> 3:28:07.040]  going to be a lower risk but there's another caveat and that is PCR tests of course notoriously
[3:28:07.040 --> 3:28:12.560]  unreliable the first number we use in the number of infected individuals in the UK is based on
[3:28:12.560 --> 3:28:19.280]  positive PCR results it's possible that only 3 percent of these positive results are actually
[3:28:19.280 --> 3:28:24.640]  accurate which means the risk of a person killing a relative without any discernible coronavirus
[3:28:24.640 --> 3:28:33.760]  symptoms may well be as low as 1 in 30 million the same sort of likelihood of you winning the
[3:28:33.760 --> 3:28:40.240]  national lottery continues clearly it's for individuals to assess the risk for themselves
[3:28:41.120 --> 3:28:45.760]  but they should do so in the knowledge of how big those risks actually are and when you boil
[3:28:45.760 --> 3:28:51.920]  down the numbers when you crunch the numbers it's the same risk as you winning the national lottery
[3:28:53.200 --> 3:28:57.600]  so you'd think given those statistics given the fact the hospital beds are emptier than they were
[3:28:57.600 --> 3:29:02.560]  at this time last year given the fact that this whole hysteria about this new mutant strain of
[3:29:02.560 --> 3:29:07.520]  COVID is complete bonk because it's been around for eight months you think the population would
[3:29:08.160 --> 3:29:14.080]  temper their enthusiasm for draconian police state de facto house arrest lockdowns
[3:29:15.600 --> 3:29:20.560]  and that's not the case in fact they support them even more now whether you can believe these
[3:29:20.560 --> 3:29:25.120]  polls or not whether you think it's people telling the pollsters what they think they want to hear
[3:29:26.240 --> 3:29:32.080]  maybe whether you think it's these people being afraid of being found out of going public with
[3:29:32.080 --> 3:29:37.520]  not supporting this COVID lockdown because they're so terrified of being publicly cancelled on social
[3:29:37.520 --> 3:29:45.200]  media or whatever guido forks blog reports three quarters of britain support the creation of the
[3:29:45.200 --> 3:29:52.800]  new tier four coronavirus restrictions this is a poll by you gov by 61 to 33 brits think the
[3:29:52.800 --> 3:29:57.120]  government has handled the issue of christmas coronavirus rules badly but then when they asked
[3:29:57.120 --> 3:30:04.720]  them if they support them the general population found that 74 percent of the population supported
[3:30:04.720 --> 3:30:11.040]  them so literally 74 percent of people apparently if you believe these polls don't want to see their
[3:30:11.040 --> 3:30:18.000]  family members at christmas they want even harsher lockdowns if you can believe that i've got a bridge
[3:30:18.000 --> 3:30:25.840]  to sell you because as i said anecdotally all i hear in the real world all i hear on social media
[3:30:25.840 --> 3:30:31.840]  all i read on the comments below all these major articles on major news websites is that there's
[3:30:31.840 --> 3:30:37.680]  a massive backlash against these measures and surely that's going to expand now given that
[3:30:37.680 --> 3:30:42.800]  not only have the christmas as of millions and millions of people who are planning to travel
[3:30:42.800 --> 3:30:48.080]  abroad to see their family members being ruined completely ruined now they're not even going
[3:30:48.080 --> 3:30:54.720]  to get their refunds from flight operators because they've said we're not canceling their flights
[3:30:54.720 --> 3:30:58.960]  we're still going to operate the flights even though there are literally like two spaniards
[3:30:58.960 --> 3:31:05.440]  on one flight flying home they're allowed to enter spain obviously but we're not is that really
[3:31:05.440 --> 3:31:13.120]  believable back don't go away mountain patriot in colorado thank you for holding how you doing
[3:31:13.120 --> 3:31:17.760]  alex man i'm just working as hard as i can we're in such a critical time brother how are you i love
[3:31:17.760 --> 3:31:24.000]  you man i want to uh make a quick plug that dna force i love it i've been using it quite a while
[3:31:24.000 --> 3:31:29.200]  and i just went looked at the ingredients again the other day and i see that it contains quercetin
[3:31:30.000 --> 3:31:37.600]  which according to some published studies that dr mercola has cited is an ionophore similar to
[3:31:37.600 --> 3:31:43.680]  hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so people might want to take a look
[3:31:43.680 --> 3:31:51.120]  at that all i know is with dna force we went out and looked at these high-end products that they
[3:31:51.120 --> 3:31:55.280]  sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle
[3:31:55.280 --> 3:31:59.040]  because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks and so
[3:31:59.040 --> 3:32:04.000]  we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this so thanks
[3:32:04.000 --> 3:32:12.960]  thanks for the plug the globalists and their minions want to play god
[3:32:14.000 --> 3:32:20.000]  jeffy schumer hillary clinton barack obama you look at these sacks of garbage and you think
[3:32:20.000 --> 3:32:27.040]  why do they hate humanity so much why do they love death because they hate themselves they project
[3:32:27.040 --> 3:32:33.680]  their own disgust with their soul on to us and once you understand that basic psychological
[3:32:33.680 --> 3:32:39.360]  point every other answer is completely clear that's why they hate info wars we believe in

[3:33:07.040 --> 3:33:16.560]  the post industrial world that's what george herbert walker bush signed on to it the
[3:33:17.360 --> 3:33:26.240]  Rio de Janeiro agenda 21 conference back in 1992 now they've launched agenda 2030 which is a post
[3:33:26.240 --> 3:33:30.560]  industrial world plow schwa with the debuts group trudeau the prime minister of janitor
[3:33:30.560 --> 3:33:37.360]  they're all on record saying the great reset is agenda 2030 well you might want to find out what
[3:33:37.360 --> 3:33:44.000]  agenda 2030 is it is the destruction of society as we know it it is making the population war
[3:33:44.000 --> 3:33:50.160]  by designs we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family they're
[3:33:50.160 --> 3:33:58.320]  destroying civilization rebuild it in their dystopic image we are fighting this at info wars.com

[3:34:10.960 --> 3:34:17.360]  you must guard your humanity you must guard your children's humanity you must guard the very genetic
[3:34:17.360 --> 3:34:21.920]  code of the planet the globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of this world
[3:34:22.880 --> 3:34:26.240]  but they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system poisoning the planet
[3:34:26.240 --> 3:34:32.240]  they are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth
[3:34:32.880 --> 3:34:36.480]  to the GMO crops and now they've moved on to their main target
[3:34:37.200 --> 3:34:43.040]  to madden with the mRNA vaccines which are not vaccines they are recombinant DNA
[3:34:44.080 --> 3:34:51.600]  from aborted cloned fetuses were then inserted into your genome to take over your body's
[3:34:51.600 --> 3:34:59.040]  systems go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned
[3:34:59.920 --> 3:35:04.000]  this is the equivalent of an alien takeover whether it's interdimensional whether it's
[3:35:04.000 --> 3:35:08.400]  little green men the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and overriding
[3:35:08.400 --> 3:35:25.840]  us it's all the same in the end you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:35:25.840 --> 3:35:34.560]  live from the summit dot news headquarters it's paul joseph watson
[3:35:38.160 --> 3:35:43.040]  so let's turn our attention to this coronavirus vaccine which apparently
[3:35:43.040 --> 3:35:48.160]  is completely fine when it comes to tackling all these hundreds of other new new mutant strains
[3:35:48.160 --> 3:35:52.640]  of coronavirus we have to lock down for that we have to be under house arrest but don't worry
[3:35:52.640 --> 3:35:57.680]  about the vaccine it's not going to affect the vaccine well now people have been researching
[3:35:57.680 --> 3:36:03.760]  more into vaccine reactions of course you saw the video a couple of days ago of the nurse receiving
[3:36:03.760 --> 3:36:09.760]  a vaccine and basically passing out within two minutes well now the cdc has and this was again
[3:36:09.760 --> 3:36:17.280]  posted on lockdown skeptics.org the cdc has produced a document documenting the side effects of the
[3:36:17.280 --> 3:36:25.360]  mRNA covid vaccine says in frequent cases of anaphylaxis a severe allergic reaction have
[3:36:25.360 --> 3:36:30.400]  been reported already however a more interesting figure is to be found further down in the
[3:36:30.400 --> 3:36:36.160]  presentation in a table entitled the safe active surveillance for covid-19 vaccines
[3:36:37.120 --> 3:36:46.880]  it says out of the 112,807 doses administered 3,150 experience what they call a quote health
[3:36:46.880 --> 3:36:54.400]  impact event described above by the cdc as quote unable to perform normal daily activities unable
[3:36:54.400 --> 3:37:02.160]  to work required care from doctor or health care professional that's about 2.8 of recipients now
[3:37:02.160 --> 3:37:09.040]  we're not arguing that adverse reactions to vaccines in small numbers on a routine thing
[3:37:10.800 --> 3:37:15.920]  problem is we're being told that we have to remain under lockdown remain under house arrest
[3:37:15.920 --> 3:37:21.280]  we're banned from traveling internally in our own country we're banned from traveling abroad
[3:37:21.280 --> 3:37:30.080]  so as not to overwhelm the NHS so as not to overwhelm the hospitals problem being if the UK
[3:37:30.080 --> 3:37:35.600]  government's declared target of vaccinating approximately 25 million people in priority
[3:37:35.600 --> 3:37:44.320]  groups is met and the proportion remains stable that 2.8 figure of adverse vaccine reactions
[3:37:44.320 --> 3:37:51.920]  in the UK alone obviously much higher numbers in the United States could be in around 700,000
[3:37:51.920 --> 3:38:00.080]  people potentially requiring some kind of medical care post vaccination that's the question isn't
[3:38:00.080 --> 3:38:06.560]  mass vaccination supposed to protect the NHS so we're being told the hospitals being overwhelmed
[3:38:06.560 --> 3:38:11.840]  that there's going to be a nightmare onslaught of new cases people dying in the corridors
[3:38:11.840 --> 3:38:18.800]  and yet by their own numbers this vaccine and the adverse reactions to it are going to create
[3:38:18.800 --> 3:38:28.320]  700,000 people requiring medical attention another thing that doesn't quite add up meanwhile
[3:38:28.320 --> 3:38:36.640]  let's get into masks have you ever noticed by the way and today especially out in the park I see
[3:38:36.640 --> 3:38:43.040]  more people wearing masks outside even though there's literally no law in the United Kingdom
[3:38:43.040 --> 3:38:48.560]  that says they have to do that more people seem to have swallowed the blue pill and they're wearing
[3:38:48.560 --> 3:38:56.400]  masks these people tend to look very serious very righteous they're good people they also appear to
[3:38:56.400 --> 3:39:02.880]  look like they've got a stick up their backside and that was evidence once more again with this
[3:39:02.880 --> 3:39:11.280]  story yesterday leftist ridiculed for bragging about wearing two face masks bid for twitter clout
[3:39:11.280 --> 3:39:16.720]  goes horribly wrong now of course as is standard at this point as soon as they started gaining
[3:39:16.720 --> 3:39:23.040]  attention the individual in question don't know whether he deleted his original tweet or blocked
[3:39:23.040 --> 3:39:27.760]  me for a start but he put his account on lockdown so you can't even see if his original tweet is
[3:39:27.760 --> 3:39:33.680]  still there thankfully I screenshotted it knowing that that would happen and this was a leftist who
[3:39:34.400 --> 3:39:40.320]  bragged about wearing not one but two face masks he said quote taking no chances queue at waitrose
[3:39:40.320 --> 3:39:49.840]  today which is a supermarket in england two masks n95 and surgical and this is a guy who has pro-eu
[3:39:49.840 --> 3:39:56.720]  remain in his bio surprisingly doesn't have his pronouns in his bio but of course by trying to
[3:39:56.720 --> 3:40:02.880]  virtue signal for internet clout by graciously wearing two face masks to show that he's such a
[3:40:02.880 --> 3:40:09.440]  good responsible citizen he only proved that the first face mask according to his own rules here
[3:40:09.440 --> 3:40:15.280]  doesn't work if the first one if you're wearing two then that only shows that the first one doesn't
[3:40:15.280 --> 3:40:23.200]  work so what's the point of course great merriment was had at his expense and he panicked and shut
[3:40:23.200 --> 3:40:32.240]  down his account by the way his tweet after that said that he would not be responding to what he
[3:40:32.240 --> 3:40:37.520]  called right wing snowflakes he said quote they seem to be making the mistake of thinking that I
[3:40:37.520 --> 3:40:44.160]  give an sh it what they think he then proceeded to spend the rest of the day responding on twitter
[3:40:44.960 --> 3:40:50.400]  to right wing snowflakes and this ties into a very important article which is up on the blaze
[3:40:50.400 --> 3:40:59.120]  and title horowitz comprehensive analysis of 50 states shows greater spread with mask mandates
[3:40:59.120 --> 3:41:06.800]  yes there are more corona virus cases in states in america where they mandated masks he writes for
[3:41:06.800 --> 3:41:11.520]  months we've been lectured to buy the political elites that masks the cases of corona virus
[3:41:11.520 --> 3:41:16.960]  are spreading too quickly and that we must wear masks to stop the spread the obvious fault with
[3:41:16.960 --> 3:41:20.800]  their act of desperation is that they can no longer mask the fact that most parts of the
[3:41:20.800 --> 3:41:26.000]  country have already been fully masked for months long before the ubiquitous spread this fall
[3:41:26.960 --> 3:41:31.920]  and you see this in european countries in spain italy france as soon as they mandated the wearing
[3:41:31.920 --> 3:41:39.120]  of masks both indoors and outdoors corona virus cases shot way up continues researchers at
[3:41:39.120 --> 3:41:44.080]  rationalground.com a clearinghouse of covet 19 data trends run by a grassroots group of data
[3:41:44.080 --> 3:41:51.040]  analysts computer scientists and actuaries did an analysis of all 50 states divided by those
[3:41:51.040 --> 3:41:57.600]  that had mask mandates and those that did not just in heart co-founder of the website posted
[3:41:57.600 --> 3:42:03.840]  the results in a twitter thread and shared with me the data analysis says they studied the number
[3:42:03.840 --> 3:42:10.480]  of cases over a 229 day period from may 1st through december 15th and divided the results of the two
[3:42:10.480 --> 3:42:16.640]  study groups by days with mask mandates and days without mask mandates the non-mandate data group
[3:42:16.640 --> 3:42:21.120]  includes both states that never had a mandate and those that did at some point but data set
[3:42:21.120 --> 3:42:27.920]  included only the days they did not have a mask mandate the results when comparing states with
[3:42:27.920 --> 3:42:34.160]  mandates versus those without or periods times within a state with a mandate versus without
[3:42:34.160 --> 3:42:41.040]  there is absolutely no evidence that the mass mandate worked to slow the spread one iota
[3:42:42.720 --> 3:42:50.000]  in total in the states that had a mandate in effect there were 9,605,000 confirmed covet
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:59.200]  cases over 5,907 days an average of 27 cases per 100,000 per day when states did not have a statewide
[3:42:59.200 --> 3:43:03.200]  order which includes the states that never had them and the period of time masking states did
[3:43:03.200 --> 3:43:13.600]  not have the mandate in place there were 5,781,000 cases over 5,700 days averaging 17 cases per 100,000
[3:43:13.600 --> 3:43:18.960]  people per day the reverse correlation between periods of masking and non-masking is remarkable
[3:43:18.960 --> 3:43:25.440]  so in the states where they did not mandate masks they had fewer corona virus cases isn't that
[3:43:25.440 --> 3:43:31.120]  interesting but again you're a bad person if you don't wear one maybe you need to wear two now
[3:43:31.120 --> 3:43:37.120]  maybe you need to wear a full gas mask maybe you even need to wear a full hazmat suit and actually
[3:43:38.800 --> 3:43:42.880]  i'm probably going to commission a poll because i commissioned a poll
[3:43:43.520 --> 3:43:50.400]  i think it was back in 2013 during the whole tsa debacle which asked americans if they would submit
[3:43:50.400 --> 3:43:58.320]  to a full body cavity search in order to be allowed to fly this was a 2013 i believe 2012
[3:43:58.320 --> 3:44:04.320]  or 2013 the result of the poll was that almost a third of americans said that they would submit
[3:44:04.320 --> 3:44:10.080]  to a full body tsa cavity search that's basically an anal probe not to get too graphic in order to
[3:44:10.080 --> 3:44:16.560]  fly so i'm going to do a poll asking people in the united kingdom where apparently we have such
[3:44:16.560 --> 3:44:22.960]  massive compliance if you believe the polls already put out what level of imposition on their liberties
[3:44:22.960 --> 3:44:28.320]  on their dignity are they willing to undergo are they willing to accept are they willing to tolerate
[3:44:29.040 --> 3:44:34.720]  in order to go about their lives and i'm deliberately if a polling agency accepts this
[3:44:34.720 --> 3:44:39.200]  because they're all grossly politicized so many of them won't even have anything to do with me
[3:44:39.840 --> 3:44:44.480]  what level of imposition what level of lockdown measures will people accept will they accept
[3:44:44.480 --> 3:44:51.040]  for example the government telling them they're not allowed to go near their own window will they
[3:44:51.040 --> 3:44:56.880]  accept the government telling them they have to wear full hazmat suits to leave their own home
[3:44:57.760 --> 3:45:02.000]  going to be very interesting as to the level the percentage of compliance
[3:45:02.640 --> 3:45:07.280]  of people who accept those measures and that's hopefully going to be happening here in the
[3:45:07.280 --> 3:45:12.160]  next couple weeks finally we have a rafter stories french law would ban people who don't get
[3:45:12.160 --> 3:45:17.360]  covid vaccine from using public transport thankfully there's massive backlash from all
[3:45:17.360 --> 3:45:23.520]  the opposition politicians in france at what they're now calling a health dictatorship
[3:45:23.520 --> 3:45:27.680]  because of this new law that would literally ban people who don't have the vaccine from using
[3:45:27.680 --> 3:45:33.360]  public transport from visiting venues and in germany german geneticists as people who refuse
[3:45:33.360 --> 3:45:40.480]  covid vaccine should be denied medical treatment literally saying that if they need ventilators
[3:45:40.480 --> 3:45:44.800]  if they need emergency medical treatment that it should be denied we also have
[3:45:44.800 --> 3:45:49.280]  british government contracts firms to make covid freedom passports initially they denied it
[3:45:49.280 --> 3:45:54.240]  now they're saying potentially you will need to get back to you to travel going to wrap it up
[3:45:54.240 --> 3:46:16.080]  warren is coming up next summit dot news go
