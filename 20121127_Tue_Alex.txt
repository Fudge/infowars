[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:31.760]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas alex jones
[00:31.760 --> 00:39.880]  ladies and gentlemen we are live on this Tuesday the 27th day of November 2012
[00:39.880 --> 00:44.200]  edition we have a jam-packed radio broadcast coming up today we have the
[00:44.200 --> 00:49.360]  head of UKIP Nigel Farage who's been battling incredible
[00:49.360 --> 00:52.960]  tyranny inside the EU joining us at the start of the next hour we have Lord
[00:52.960 --> 00:56.680]  Christopher Moncton also one of the founders of UKIP joining us with a
[00:56.680 --> 01:00.520]  ton of important news including libertarians and conservatives now
[01:00.520 --> 01:04.440]  having their children taken and the government will not apologize there they
[01:04.440 --> 01:09.520]  say it's racist to be pro sovereignty of England of the UK or any other country
[01:09.520 --> 01:13.560]  region that is coming up after the break and we have a lot of other off-the-chart
[01:13.560 --> 01:18.760]  news but let me premiere at least a section of this special report now where
[01:18.760 --> 01:23.560]  I break down Zbigniew Brzezinski here it is Alex Jones here with some
[01:23.560 --> 01:28.240]  incredibly positive news Zbigniew Brzezinski who is a top globalist
[01:28.240 --> 01:33.120]  advisor to David Rockefeller as well as the House of Rothschild recently gave a
[01:33.120 --> 01:37.200]  speech in Poland where he told the global elite that the entire world
[01:37.200 --> 01:42.480]  population is waking up to the external New World Order and he went on to even
[01:42.480 --> 01:48.920]  say that political awakening and nationalism and resistance is threatening
[01:48.920 --> 01:54.400]  their takeover of society the full speech is posted in an article at
[01:54.400 --> 01:59.440]  infowars.com by Paul Watson Brzezinski populist resistance is derailing the
[01:59.440 --> 02:04.800]  New World Order quote rise in political activism a threat to external control
[02:04.800 --> 02:08.840]  during a recent speech in Poland former US National Security Advisers of
[02:08.840 --> 02:12.800]  Brzezinski warned fellow elitists that worldwide resistance that's a quote
[02:12.800 --> 02:17.520]  movement to external control driven by populist activism is threatening to
[02:17.520 --> 02:21.680]  derail the move towards a New World Order. Now before we show the clip
[02:21.680 --> 02:26.760]  remember Hillary Clinton said the same thing a few years ago that they're
[02:26.760 --> 02:32.480]  losing the info war. We are in an information war and we are losing that
[02:32.480 --> 02:38.840]  war I'll be very blunt in my assessment. No the US isn't losing the info war the
[02:38.840 --> 02:43.680]  foreign megabanks that brag that they've hijacked our federal government
[02:43.680 --> 02:48.840]  they're beginning to lose the info war. Worldwide the free peoples of this
[02:48.840 --> 02:52.680]  planet are discovering the private corporate fascistic world government
[02:52.680 --> 02:57.360]  that poses as a liberal socialism and they are waking up to it and resisting
[02:57.360 --> 03:02.920]  it. Here is a short excerpt from Brzezinski speech. In recent decades worldwide
[03:02.920 --> 03:08.360]  social change has experienced unprecedented historical acceleration
[03:08.360 --> 03:14.720]  particularly because instant mass communications such as radio, television
[03:14.720 --> 03:22.240]  and the internet cumulatively have been stimulating a universal awakening of
[03:22.240 --> 03:30.680]  mass political consciousness. Persistent and highly motivated populist
[03:30.680 --> 03:37.640]  resistance of politically awakened and historically resentful peoples the
[03:37.640 --> 03:43.920]  external control has proven to be increasingly difficult to suppress. Two
[03:43.920 --> 03:48.520]  years previous he made similar comments to the Council on Foreign Relations of
[03:48.520 --> 03:58.240]  Canada. That for the first time in all of human history mankind is politically
[03:58.240 --> 04:04.720]  awakened that's a total new reality and no matter where you go politics is a
[04:04.720 --> 04:11.880]  matter of social engagement and most people know what is generally going on
[04:11.880 --> 04:18.040]  generally going on in the world and are consciously aware of global iniquities
[04:18.040 --> 04:23.000]  inequalities lack of respect exploitation.
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.200]  Brzezinski's new book that came out earlier this year gets into more detail
[04:27.200 --> 04:31.240]  where he hits the panic button to the elite controllers and tells them they
[04:31.240 --> 04:35.960]  had better wake up and understand humanity is awake and staring so this is
[04:35.960 --> 04:40.080]  some more positive news now normally I don't just believe something Brzezinski
[04:40.080 --> 04:44.840]  saying in a speech but I from my own research know that what he's saying is
[04:44.840 --> 04:48.360]  accurate and many globalist white papers that are not meant for public
[04:48.360 --> 04:54.040]  reading but are available are raising the same alarm they know that humanity is
[04:54.040 --> 04:57.920]  waking up ladies and gentlemen we'll air the rest of this report coming up
[04:57.920 --> 05:02.080]  later Lord Christopher Monkton straight at the globalist you Genesis control

[08:42.600 --> 08:46.560]  Christopher Monkton one of the founders of the UK Independence Party which is a

[08:51.880 --> 08:56.960]  country one of the largest electing all sorts of members to parliament but also
[08:56.960 --> 09:01.800]  the European Union Parliament they're now taking the children of their members
[09:01.800 --> 09:06.960]  saying well we got a tip your UKIP you can't have kids we're taking them so when
[09:06.960 --> 09:10.040]  you see the Marxist and they're always saying you don't like socialism you're

[09:45.200 --> 09:48.440]  obviously but also important because we do want to give people a good hearing
[09:48.440 --> 09:52.800]  out the Belizean authorities are well known for classic
[09:52.800 --> 09:57.000]  piratical corruption and frame-ups I've been down in Belize city many times let

[11:37.680 --> 11:41.720]  Australia and the US for a great extent but especially the UK are testing
[11:41.720 --> 11:46.760]  grounds where they arrested BBC reporter Robin Page who had a rural
[11:46.760 --> 11:50.920]  affairs show because he said rural communities to serve the same rights as
[11:50.920 --> 11:55.320]  Muslims and homosexuals they arrested him we had him on the show and said the
[11:55.320 --> 12:00.440]  word homosexual is hateful and be like if you called a white person a Caucasian
[12:00.440 --> 12:05.360]  would they be arrested for racism it shows where now a type of voodoo against
[12:05.360 --> 12:08.760]  science itself you say heterosexual homosexual
[12:08.760 --> 12:14.280]  Caucasoid Asian you're arrested they have spies and restaurants to hear of
[12:14.280 --> 12:18.400]  you criticize the open borders having to pay welfare whether it's to white
[12:18.400 --> 12:23.120]  Eastern Europeans or black Africans you're arrested and it hauled in as
[12:23.120 --> 12:28.760]  part of a Soviet show trial this is one inch from the reeducation camps it's
[12:28.760 --> 12:33.000]  come out in congressional testimony and FBI files that Obama who was at
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.360]  meetings with Bill Ayers where they talked about putting 50 million Americans
[12:37.360 --> 12:41.240]  in reeducation camps yes it's really happening that they said if you don't
[12:41.240 --> 12:44.400]  agree with the global warming and don't want to pay them carbon taxes you should
[12:44.400 --> 12:48.560]  be arrested that's in our newspapers hundreds of them it's in the in the UK
[12:48.560 --> 12:54.280]  papers and Lord Monkton they've called for his arrest and he joins us former
[12:54.280 --> 12:58.160]  top adviser a scientific adviser to Margaret Thatcher inventor journalist
[12:58.160 --> 13:02.720]  former newspaper editor of major dailies here is a headline UKIP foster
[13:02.720 --> 13:09.240]  couple are agony and and and proudly the town council says they were reported
[13:09.240 --> 13:12.360]  anonymously they were they were members of the UK Independence Party and they
[13:12.360 --> 13:16.600]  said that is racism well right there's total lawsuit because if they were
[13:16.600 --> 13:22.000]  racist that's their free speech but they're not UKIP is openly the fast
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.160]  growing and scaring people calling for the EU not to be making 80 plus percent
[13:26.160 --> 13:30.560]  of their laws people of all races religions in it they're afraid of them
[13:30.560 --> 13:34.640]  the Marxists are afraid of them because they control the left and the right in
[13:34.640 --> 13:39.880]  that country and now joining us is Lord Monkton they've demanded an apology
[13:39.880 --> 13:44.040]  taking their kids but they're saying they're not going to apologize right now
[13:44.040 --> 13:48.840]  so this shows how frightening this has gotten where people are now arrested in
[13:48.840 --> 13:52.880]  the euro if they criticize the euro that's being called racism it's like
[13:52.880 --> 13:57.080]  when we say we don't want government-run healthcare it's a nightmare they say on
[13:57.080 --> 14:02.000]  MSNBC you're a racist this is how the communists operate Lord Monkton thank
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.880]  you for joining us can you break down exactly what we're facing and correct me
[14:05.880 --> 14:10.400]  if I'm wrong well in fact you're absolutely right Alex as usual what
[14:10.400 --> 14:15.200]  has happened here is that Rotherham Council which is a local of county
[14:15.200 --> 14:21.440]  authority which is controlled by Marxists from the extreme hard left of the
[14:21.440 --> 14:27.240]  Labour Party which seems to be most of the Labour Party these days they took away
[14:27.240 --> 14:35.240]  two foster children from very good and experienced foster parents in Rotherham
[14:35.240 --> 14:41.000]  who have looked after many foster children before often from very difficult
[14:41.000 --> 14:46.320]  backgrounds and these two children were from an ethnic minority and they had
[14:46.320 --> 14:51.520]  come into Britain via the EU immigration policy by which Britain no longer
[14:51.520 --> 14:57.400]  controls her own borders now the to the couple belong to the United Kingdom
[14:57.400 --> 15:01.960]  independence party to which I also belong until recently I was deputy leader
[15:01.960 --> 15:09.520]  now I'm the leader of its Scottish division and the this party is not a
[15:09.520 --> 15:16.000]  racist party it never has been and it most certainly isn't the party does
[15:16.000 --> 15:23.720]  want sensible control of immigration but not done on a racial basis at all but
[15:23.720 --> 15:29.560]  the left are very very frightened as you know Alex of any dissent at all any
[15:29.560 --> 15:34.680]  really effective party in opposition to the left they are frightened of it and
[15:34.680 --> 15:39.480]  they will use techniques like this for the sake of trying to blacken its name
[15:39.480 --> 15:44.200]  nationally and this is spectacularly blown up in their face because the
[15:44.200 --> 15:49.120]  couple went public and they said we are not racists the party we belong to is
[15:49.120 --> 15:53.760]  not racist there is absolutely no excuse for this we were not given any
[15:53.760 --> 15:57.520]  chance to have our say before the children were taken away and I think
[15:57.520 --> 16:02.080]  what's going to happen is that because the local authority won't apologize
[16:02.080 --> 16:05.720]  which of course is what it should have done straight away the couple will
[16:05.720 --> 16:10.920]  eventually go to court and ask for what we call judicial review of the
[16:10.920 --> 16:14.600]  administrative decision well they have to because it'll stand the charge that
[16:14.600 --> 16:18.440]  they're racist because they belong to the fastest growing one of the largest
[16:18.440 --> 16:23.640]  parties with prestigious people like yourself and mr. Farage leading it well
[16:23.640 --> 16:28.040]  and we've also just converted Lord Hesketh he used to be the leader of the
[16:28.040 --> 16:32.320]  Conservative Party in the House of Lords he is now a member of UKIP we have
[16:32.320 --> 16:37.840]  Stuart Wheeler who's our treasurer he's a millionaire he's been talking to eight
[16:37.840 --> 16:42.440]  Conservative backbenchers about whether they would like to defect from the
[16:42.440 --> 16:46.640]  Conservative Party and join the United Kingdom independence party this is a
[16:46.640 --> 16:52.160]  rapidly growing party the second largest party in Britain in the elections to the
[16:52.160 --> 16:55.680]  European Parliament this is a major force to be reckoned with it may well
[16:55.680 --> 16:59.720]  indeed be the largest party after the but never mind your real policies we'll
[16:59.720 --> 17:03.960]  just call you racist so that's that's what they do see they're frightened
[17:03.960 --> 17:08.080]  of us they're very very worried that we're beginning to make inroads not
[17:08.080 --> 17:12.440]  only into the Conservative Party but also into the Labour Party because the
[17:12.440 --> 17:17.640]  Labour Party has been always very soft on immigration on the simple metric that
[17:17.640 --> 17:22.520]  people who come from other countries and live here tend to vote left rather than
[17:22.520 --> 17:26.640]  right and so the Labour Party wants to let in as many immigrants as it can while
[17:26.640 --> 17:29.920]  pretending to be reasonably tough on immigration that's the name of the game
[17:29.920 --> 17:34.360]  and so they don't like you keep pointing things like this out now and in
[17:34.360 --> 17:38.800]  pointing these things out we are not being racist all we're doing is saying
[17:38.800 --> 17:43.480]  that we need to make sure that we have reasonable control of our borders we are
[17:43.480 --> 17:47.520]  completely overrun and here's the deal we bring in 30 million illegals and they
[17:47.520 --> 17:51.960]  all vote for gun control basically they all vote to take our rights that's the
[17:51.960 --> 17:56.720]  socialist mode bring in foreigners who are affiliated with the state and then
[17:56.720 --> 18:01.000]  out vote the original citizens and now it's getting so bad in Europe and so
[18:01.000 --> 18:05.040]  bad in England so bad here people are finally waking up as our economies go
[18:05.040 --> 18:09.760]  bankrupt and as the Treasury goes bankrupt that's exactly it because we can
[18:09.760 --> 18:14.000]  no longer afford to allow people from all over the world to come here and go
[18:14.000 --> 18:18.000]  straight on the dial and claim benefits from hard-working working-class
[18:18.000 --> 18:23.200]  British people who are paying ever larger amounts of taxation not to support
[18:23.200 --> 18:27.120]  themselves and their families but to support the families of people from
[18:27.120 --> 18:31.400]  all over the world who on any view have absolutely no right to be here and have
[18:31.400 --> 18:36.600]  contributed nothing themselves to our society now it's not racialist to point
[18:36.600 --> 18:42.160]  this out even the Conservative Party is now beginning to say this and the left
[18:42.160 --> 18:45.600]  are becoming frightened but it came out with Tony Blair they had a secret deal
[18:45.600 --> 18:51.280]  for a decade with the EU to bring in unlimited illegals criminals you name
[18:51.280 --> 18:54.800]  it is quiet and he didn't let anybody know this was happening the Conservatives
[18:54.800 --> 18:59.360]  were too lazy to ask we found out we broke the story and of course the left
[18:59.360 --> 19:04.600]  haters for this they know that now we are effectively replacing the Conservative
[19:04.600 --> 19:09.280]  Party as the opposition because we know the facts we smoke out what's going on
[19:09.280 --> 19:13.760]  and we then come out and say so and they don't like this so the left are now
[19:13.760 --> 19:17.320]  more frightened of us than they are of the Conservative Party because they can
[19:17.320 --> 19:20.720]  see that the way things are going the United Kingdom independence party is
[19:20.720 --> 19:25.160]  going to replace the Conservative Party as the party of the right in Britain and
[19:25.160 --> 19:30.080]  we are much more effective operators than they are I was in a meeting in the
[19:30.080 --> 19:34.400]  House of Commons just a few hours ago with the president of the Czech Republic
[19:34.400 --> 19:42.040]  on the European question and he was saying well you know we we all now need
[19:42.040 --> 19:46.280]  to think about whether the euro has a future whether the European Union has a
[19:46.280 --> 19:50.800]  future and he said they will call us racists even for raising these questions
[19:50.800 --> 19:54.480]  that's right Lord Monkton stay there incredible hear about your meeting with
[19:54.480 --> 19:59.080]  a European Union president in a moment we'll be right back

[24:19.440 --> 24:24.720]  more Moncton will be with us till about 40 after he's gonna give us a break down
[24:24.720 --> 24:31.400]  on the tyrants latest attacks on our liberties via the green movement cover
[24:31.400 --> 24:38.360]  they run he is probably the world expert geopolitically on what the socialist
[24:38.360 --> 24:45.800]  and Marxist and basically armies of evil control freak dumb are up to but you
[24:45.800 --> 24:49.840]  need to understand ladies and gentlemen I have found bribery going on at the
[24:49.840 --> 24:53.720]  capital that made the front page of the paper and they called me up and asked
[24:53.720 --> 24:57.400]  if I was a racist and it had nothing to do with race and I said why are you
[24:57.400 --> 25:00.600]  asking me this they said we want to just know if you're a racist and then the
[25:00.600 --> 25:06.160]  guy started giggling on the other end of the phone they know it's a weapon okay
[25:06.160 --> 25:08.800]  and you need to understand as word Moncton has traveled all over the world
[25:08.800 --> 25:15.240]  is exposed the carbon taxes will kill a billion people most of them brown so
[25:15.240 --> 25:19.080]  Lord Moncton actually goes and feeds people starving and Haiti and I'm so
[25:19.080 --> 25:25.160]  sick of the eugenicist population reduction is left calling themselves
[25:25.160 --> 25:29.200]  left Thomas Jefferson was a liberal these people are control freak
[25:29.200 --> 25:33.600]  authoritarian monsters who won't control the resources Lord Moncton I'm sorry I'm
[25:33.600 --> 25:39.040]  ranting but it's so over the top to be constantly called racist by these people
[25:39.040 --> 25:45.440]  when when they are certified from my research absolute anti-humans period
[25:45.440 --> 25:53.040]  well in particular they are anti-black and brown and yellow humans people who
[25:53.040 --> 25:58.160]  tend to be poorer than the average other ones who are going to get hurt first
[25:58.160 --> 26:03.160]  and worst by their environmental policies there's no doubt about this I've
[26:03.160 --> 26:09.080]  just been reading the next UN climate report they come out every five years
[26:09.080 --> 26:14.320]  as another one coming out next year and I am now an appointed expert reviewer for
[26:14.320 --> 26:19.720]  that document and it is full of the same sort of rubbish that's in the previous
[26:19.720 --> 26:26.000]  documents and I've had to write so far 70 pages of comments saying you're going
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.880]  to have to clean this up and start doing honest science again because the kind of
[26:30.880 --> 26:35.440]  policies that these people advocate using the bogus science from the UN's
[26:35.440 --> 26:41.480]  climate panel are policies that will indeed be making poor people poorer still
[26:41.480 --> 26:45.000]  I don't think I would go so far as to say as that they're going to end up
[26:45.000 --> 26:50.080]  killing a billion people there have been books by people like Paul Ehrlich saying
[26:50.080 --> 26:53.720]  that they would like to see the population of the world to reduce from
[26:53.720 --> 26:58.960]  its present seven billion down to one billion people losing six billion or
[26:58.960 --> 27:02.920]  just interrupt because you raised that reading your papers at science and
[27:02.920 --> 27:08.120]  public policy and give that URL out for folks if they implemented the carbon
[27:08.120 --> 27:12.680]  taxes of Copenhagen there's already 30 plus million people starving to death
[27:12.680 --> 27:17.360]  50 million you know total if you take associated deaths from malnutrition
[27:17.360 --> 27:21.400]  there's an additional 20 million on the 30 but I was actually going off some of
[27:21.400 --> 27:26.080]  your research and some other research I mean correct me if they implemented
[27:26.080 --> 27:30.600]  their plans would it not be a billion debt over a decade if they get away with
[27:30.600 --> 27:34.520]  what they're trying to do then very large numbers of people in poorer
[27:34.520 --> 27:38.200]  countries will die it's very difficult to put numbers on it frankly because it
[27:38.200 --> 27:42.960]  depends on how much of their extremist nonsense they get away with and I'm glad
[27:42.960 --> 27:46.760]  to say that gradually more and more scientists are now standing up and
[27:46.760 --> 27:51.640]  saying that we can't turn our backs and just be quiet anymore we're going to take
[27:51.640 --> 27:56.160]  the risk of speaking out even though we will then be called racist and all sorts
[27:56.160 --> 28:00.800]  of other names and they will vilify us and go after our reputation I've had it
[28:00.800 --> 28:05.000]  all thrown at me Alex oh you say you're a member of the House of Lords and they
[28:05.000 --> 28:11.080]  say you're not and you're just a racist all these childish insults anything
[28:11.080 --> 28:16.000]  rather than talk about the actual science which doesn't add up there's been no
[28:16.000 --> 28:23.000]  global warming now this is breaking news for 16 full years none whatever and
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.360]  here they are writing yet another year not away you were the first to break that
[28:27.360 --> 28:30.760]  down with scientific research they now admit all that in the news but going
[28:30.760 --> 28:33.400]  back in the in the brief time we have in this segment longer segment coming up
[28:33.400 --> 28:37.480]  Lord Monkton go back to your meeting with the Czech president there at the
[28:37.480 --> 28:41.040]  House of Lords yes this was a fact it was the House of Commons actually this was
[28:41.040 --> 28:45.760]  fascinating because quite a large audience came and he was saying that the
[28:45.760 --> 28:51.720]  left are gradually pushing their way in taking everything over and and he said
[28:51.720 --> 28:55.360]  that you now really can't tell the difference between the major policies of
[28:55.360 --> 29:00.680]  the EU and communism he used the word he has seen this and he's finding it
[29:00.680 --> 29:04.960]  increasingly difficult to to restrain himself from speaking out about he's
[29:04.960 --> 29:08.680]  just got a very book a very good book just come out called Europe the
[29:08.680 --> 29:12.440]  shattering of illusions maybe you should get it at the Alex Jones store it's a

[29:16.720 --> 29:22.280]  which the European Union is dismantling democracy in exactly the same way as the
[29:22.280 --> 29:26.320]  environmental movement are doing across the European Union is right in there
[29:26.320 --> 29:29.760]  working with the well they call themselves a new Soviet stay there

[32:50.880 --> 32:55.880]  at www.silverlungs.com for more information on why you should be
[32:55.880 --> 33:08.360]  producing your own silver solutions right from your home forever rallying
[33:08.360 --> 33:19.200]  patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's Alex Jones coming up the
[33:19.200 --> 33:25.240]  Democratic Party is now running around saying that guns are terrorist weapons
[33:25.240 --> 33:29.560]  so now they want to take your guns the name of the war on terror the chairman
[33:29.560 --> 33:34.120]  of the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has provided sparring
[33:34.120 --> 33:39.000]  terrorist land idea use a 22 rifle to take out power transformers and they're
[33:39.000 --> 33:42.880]  now saying we've got to ban guns because terrorists may use them to shoot up to
[33:42.880 --> 33:47.520]  power transformers just hoping copycats go out and do it that's coming up
[33:47.520 --> 33:51.200]  okay Lord Moncton you've got the floor here for the next 10 minutes break down
[33:51.200 --> 33:57.280]  the points you're making this is not hyperbole the way they've bankrupted
[33:57.280 --> 34:02.200]  Europe with socialism then their answer is bring in even more foreigners who
[34:02.200 --> 34:09.280]  then threaten to riot if you don't raise taxes again to then engage in more
[34:09.280 --> 34:15.120]  social engineering France is over 80% tax for people that actually work where
[34:15.120 --> 34:20.440]  is all this headed where is Europe going and as England and the rest of the UK
[34:20.440 --> 34:24.480]  starts to wake up the fact that you're under this domination and EU bureaucrats
[34:24.480 --> 34:29.960]  are exempt from taxes and the parliament is ceremonial where does it all end and
[34:29.960 --> 34:35.480]  what is the latest Lord Moncton on their latest strategies to shut the power off
[34:35.480 --> 34:39.520]  in the West and seize control well what they're going to do next is they're
[34:39.520 --> 34:45.520]  already paying 3,000 EU bureaucrats more than the Prime Minister gets which he
[34:45.520 --> 34:51.720]  gets 250,000 dollars a year and there are now 3,000 EU bureaucrats who get more
[34:51.720 --> 34:56.720]  money per year than the British Prime Minister and they don't have to pay
[34:56.720 --> 35:02.640]  tax on it and he does so this is becoming a pampered overclass which is
[35:02.640 --> 35:08.200]  gradually destroying the economies of all the countries that belong to it
[35:08.200 --> 35:13.320]  there's a big row going on at the moment between Britain Germany France on the
[35:13.320 --> 35:18.680]  one hand and the and we're on the paying end if you like of Europe and the
[35:18.680 --> 35:22.440]  receiving countries who as you say are demanding more money more social
[35:22.440 --> 35:26.560]  engineering more feather bedding and they're saying that we who are
[35:26.560 --> 35:30.560]  relatively prosperous should be paying for this and the British people no
[35:30.560 --> 35:35.520]  longer want to do that want out if we were to leave the European Union then we
[35:35.520 --> 35:39.520]  would no longer be running an annual deficit Britain is a prosperous enough
[35:39.520 --> 35:44.800]  country but if we stopped being in the European Union we'd have no more annual
[35:44.800 --> 35:50.000]  deficit and we could start in that the national debt and if we don't leave the
[35:50.000 --> 35:54.320]  European Union then Britain will go down as many other countries of the
[35:54.320 --> 36:00.840]  European will go down as the ever-growing costs of various welfare
[36:00.840 --> 36:06.640]  handouts completely outstrip any possible capacity of taxpayers to pay for
[36:06.640 --> 36:11.760]  it you're quite right the top rate of tax on the rich in France is now 75 or
[36:11.760 --> 36:18.280]  80 percent in Britain it's already gone up to 50 percent it was 40 I got it down
[36:18.280 --> 36:21.960]  in fact from 60 to 40 when I was working at 10 Downing Street and I worked
[36:21.960 --> 36:27.080]  with the then finance minister to take it down for a huge resistance from the
[36:27.080 --> 36:30.680]  bureaucrats until they realized that we were getting more money from the rich by
[36:30.680 --> 36:35.680]  taxing them at a lower rate and you're now able to force the prime minister to
[36:35.680 --> 36:40.480]  actually act like a constitutionalist and they're now stealing and adopting
[36:40.480 --> 36:45.400]  which I guess is a good thing if they actually carry it through the UKIP
[36:45.400 --> 36:51.280]  platform well of course the the the prime minister is now in a very hard
[36:51.280 --> 36:55.840]  place because he his backbenchers the people who don't have jobs in his
[36:55.840 --> 36:58.720]  government but are all sitting in parliament wondering what to do with
[36:58.720 --> 37:03.080]  themselves because parliament no longer has any role in making legislation
[37:03.080 --> 37:08.160]  that's all done for us now by Europe it's just a kind of ceremonial body as
[37:08.160 --> 37:11.800]  you say so they're beginning to become quite fractious and they have realized
[37:11.800 --> 37:17.960]  that while UKIP remains a growing force in politics and a very rapidly growing
[37:17.960 --> 37:23.600]  force then never again can the Conservatives win an overall majority in
[37:23.600 --> 37:27.560]  Parliament and if they can't win an overall majority they can't govern on
[37:27.560 --> 37:31.360]  their own by the way you are the model what UKIP has done if we could get a
[37:31.360 --> 37:37.280]  real constitutional libertarian real conservative pro-liberty type group in
[37:37.280 --> 37:41.440]  in the Republicans we could reverse things as well but this is the
[37:41.440 --> 37:45.000]  globalist model your Tea Party is doing a very good job in that general
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.520]  direction you now have many Tea Party candidates in the Republican Party but
[37:48.520 --> 37:52.760]  they haven't yet penetrated right to the top and there was the problem for the
[37:52.760 --> 37:57.040]  second time running the Republicans chose the one candidate who arguably
[37:57.040 --> 38:01.040]  didn't have the slightest chance of ever beating Obama when I first heard they'd
[38:01.040 --> 38:04.840]  pick Romney instead of say Herman Cain who would have beaten Obama to a cock
[38:04.840 --> 38:09.520]  I knew then that they were going to lose it wasn't sure enough they have and you
[38:09.520 --> 38:12.840]  know you can say that maybe Obama fiddled the vote in various places and
[38:12.840 --> 38:16.560]  the Democrats didn't do this much more ruthlessly on a larger scale than the
[38:16.560 --> 38:21.440]  Republicans do but the fact is that Obama won it because the Republicans
[38:21.440 --> 38:26.200]  don't have the fight that's right Herman Cain or anybody who had fight would
[38:26.200 --> 38:30.680]  have destroyed Obama meant Romney tried to become Obama and now their argument
[38:30.680 --> 38:35.760]  is oh we need to become more socialist that's why conservatives didn't win an
[38:35.760 --> 38:39.800]  absolute manipulation well this is a problem of course if you want to beat
[38:39.800 --> 38:45.000]  Obama then do the one thing where he's really vulnerable and that is take him
[38:45.000 --> 38:49.800]  to court because he has put up on the White House website a birth certificate
[38:49.800 --> 38:54.200]  that's manifestly bogus I was approached by lawyers in the United States last
[38:54.200 --> 38:58.960]  week and asked to produce an affidavit looking at the evidence that the sheriff
[38:58.960 --> 39:02.680]  had assembled and working out what were the mathematical chances that that
[39:02.680 --> 39:07.040]  document was genuine if their evidence was correct and the answer is that there
[39:07.040 --> 39:12.120]  was a chart that it was genuine it was one in about 75 sextillion that it was
[39:12.120 --> 39:15.560]  genuine and the rest of the time it was very very clear this is a bogus
[39:15.560 --> 39:20.320]  document but will the Republicans lift a finger to do anything about this no
[39:20.320 --> 39:25.120]  they won't they're terrified of the left which on issues which really matter to
[39:25.120 --> 39:29.680]  it like keeping Obama in power they will do anything to destroy and discredit the
[39:29.680 --> 39:34.840]  reputation of anyone who did raise that matter and the right in America have
[39:34.840 --> 39:38.280]  become frightened of this they're terrified for their reputation they
[39:38.280 --> 39:42.760]  won't speak out against Obama and that's how he got away with it and the
[39:42.760 --> 39:47.440]  answer is you do have to fight when you have somebody who possibly was born
[39:47.440 --> 39:52.800]  somewhere else but certainly has an alien outlook on the future of America and
[39:52.800 --> 39:57.180]  he's there in the White House it's no good sitting back and letting him
[39:57.180 --> 40:01.920]  dismantle your country the Republican Party has got to learn to fight on
[40:01.920 --> 40:06.240]  ground where it's going to win and by the way going back to you could being
[40:06.240 --> 40:09.960]  really the model over here and some of the things Ron Paul's done and can be
[40:09.960 --> 40:14.880]  for liberty being the model you guys for what over a decade have been hammering
[40:14.880 --> 40:19.640]  that the EU makes most your laws when no one was listening now and I'm not just
[40:19.640 --> 40:23.920]  saying this I read British newspapers every day and UK papers and EU papers
[40:23.920 --> 40:29.440]  you're now setting the agenda in spades in triplicate even though most the time
[40:29.440 --> 40:32.360]  they don't give you credit that doesn't matter the real value is you're
[40:32.360 --> 40:36.560]  beginning to set the agenda people in the UK are realizing there is a
[40:36.560 --> 40:40.040]  authoritarian takeover people in the European nations who are being told
[40:40.040 --> 40:43.520]  to give up whatever sovereignty you had left to the bureaucrats they're waking
[40:43.520 --> 40:48.360]  up just like if we expose globalist of hijacked us and that global corporate
[40:48.360 --> 40:52.320]  interests of hijacked us and that mega banks brag that they've hijacked us and
[40:52.320 --> 40:57.400]  that Obama has told Congress that NATO and the UN is over our military if we
[40:57.400 --> 41:03.320]  simply expose what they've arrogantly bragged about their arrogance will bring
[41:03.320 --> 41:08.720]  them down if we just do what Ron Paul did in his farewell address expose that
[41:08.720 --> 41:13.960]  it is a global government run by criminal bureaucrats and their financial
[41:13.960 --> 41:19.200]  backers like George Soros Lord mobkin isn't it time to just embrace reality as
[41:19.200 --> 41:24.600]  you've done and admit what we're under I think what you have to do is to say we
[41:24.600 --> 41:30.240]  will not let democracy die we will not allow the vision of your founding
[41:30.240 --> 41:35.640]  fathers to disappear we will not allow these bureaucrats worldwide the
[41:35.640 --> 41:41.520]  Brzezinski's of this world to set up a global government behind our backs and
[41:41.520 --> 41:45.800]  then inflicted upon whether on the excuse of the environment or any other
[41:45.800 --> 41:50.360]  excuse we will not allow regional governments like that of the EU any
[41:50.360 --> 41:55.720]  longer to remain as unelected and undemocratic as they are now we will
[41:55.720 --> 42:01.760]  win our democracy back and those on the left who don't like it get this we are
[42:01.760 --> 42:08.960]  not going to allow you to prevail we the people still believe in ourselves and
[42:08.960 --> 42:13.160]  for as long as we believe in ourselves whatever you try to do whatever
[42:13.160 --> 42:18.240]  bureaucratic structure you try to create you will not prevail we will prevail
[42:18.240 --> 42:22.640]  whether you like it or not well said Lord Monkton I'm gonna give your website
[42:22.640 --> 42:27.560]  out it's on screen for prison planet TV viewers science and public policy dot
[42:27.560 --> 42:34.840]  org a veritable encyclopedia of graphs documents proof and again I've been
[42:34.840 --> 42:38.320]  watching Lord Monkton for more than a decade before he became popular here in
[42:38.320 --> 42:43.400]  the United States and just it's it's uncanny how accurate he's been
[42:43.400 --> 42:48.320]  predicting exposing their frauds I mean if there's one guy shoving the sword
[42:48.320 --> 42:52.040]  into the dragon's heart it's Lord Monkton that's why he's demonized and
[42:52.040 --> 42:55.440]  attacked and lied about so savagely the system hopes that you're not paying
[42:55.440 --> 42:59.200]  attention and just buys into their surface attacks but more and more that's
[42:59.200 --> 43:03.560]  not working in just the two minutes we've got left I know you're gonna be
[43:03.560 --> 43:07.560]  traveling the Middle East soon what is the latest UN global government power
[43:07.560 --> 43:12.920]  grab that we're facing well what they're going to do next is they're going to
[43:12.920 --> 43:17.920]  try to establish a global climate regime with the UN in charge this is the
[43:17.920 --> 43:21.680]  thing they've been trying to do all along they were thwarted at Copenhagen
[43:21.680 --> 43:25.360]  because I got hold of an early copy of the draft treaty in which they were
[43:25.360 --> 43:28.840]  going to set up a world government we've stopped that but they're still trying
[43:28.840 --> 43:32.760]  and they're trying to say that the problem is ever more urgent but that
[43:32.760 --> 43:39.080]  can't be right because since the second assessment report of the UN in 1995
[43:39.080 --> 43:43.320]  there's been virtually no global warming since then it stopped doesn't mean it
[43:43.320 --> 43:47.200]  stopped forever I would expect to see it resume next year actually but only at a
[43:47.200 --> 43:53.080]  very slow rate a rate so slow that we don't have to worry about it and so what
[43:53.080 --> 43:58.560]  we'll be doing in Qatar at the 18th of these annual climate conferences where
[43:58.560 --> 44:03.120]  the UN little by little is trying to build itself a new power base around
[44:03.120 --> 44:07.440]  the environmental movement we will be there to stop them we're not going to
[44:07.440 --> 44:12.480]  allow anti scientific extremism to prevail we're going to say that after
[44:12.480 --> 44:17.320]  16 years without any global warming and you know in 16 of the 18 years they've
[44:17.320 --> 44:21.800]  been meeting there hasn't been any global warming the time has come to face
[44:21.800 --> 44:26.760]  reality realize that the computer models were tweaked so as deliberately to get
[44:26.760 --> 44:30.760]  it wrong and exaggerate the problem realized that in fact there is no
[44:30.760 --> 44:34.680]  problem Hurricane Sandy had nothing to do with global warming it was a purely
[44:34.680 --> 44:38.960]  natural this is pure voodoo like witch doctors 5,000 years ago saying give me
[44:38.960 --> 44:43.760]  the power or the devil god will eat the Sun during an eclipse I mean they get on
[44:43.760 --> 44:47.920]  the news they tell school children here how they do it in England hey you saw
[44:47.920 --> 44:53.000]  that thunderstorm that's cuz your your dad had a fire in the fireplace that's
[44:53.000 --> 44:57.680]  right it's it's all this pathetic dumbness I mean if you look at Harvard
[44:57.680 --> 45:03.800]  University 2,800 undergraduates have just voted to tell the university that it
[45:03.800 --> 45:09.320]  must take all of its 30 billion dollar investments out of fossil fuel companies
[45:09.320 --> 45:13.560]  because they're destroying the planet of course they're perfectly happy to do
[45:13.560 --> 45:16.600]  their studies by the light of the electricity generated by these fossil
[45:16.600 --> 45:20.120]  fuels but no they get on the hike high horse and they make these kind of
[45:20.120 --> 45:24.320]  pietistic statements now these are the people who are supposed to be the future
[45:24.320 --> 45:28.800]  leaders of America and it frankly makes me sick that they are as easily fooled
[45:28.800 --> 45:34.040]  and as scientifically ignorant as they are the fact is we now know they've got
[45:34.040 --> 45:40.800]  it wrong here just very quickly going back to 2008 when the world's leading
[45:40.800 --> 45:45.320]  climate modelers said that if there was 15 years or more without global warming
[45:45.320 --> 45:50.040]  the models would be wrong they would have exaggerated the problem well hey
[45:50.040 --> 45:56.040]  there's now been 16 years without global warming so on their own criteria the
[45:56.040 --> 46:01.680]  modelers have failed and the entire basis for this scam in the computer models
[46:01.680 --> 46:08.920]  is now proven to be wrong by the failure of that sir as you know in closing there
[46:08.920 --> 46:12.640]  are useful idiots at the lower level this is their religion of feeling good
[46:12.640 --> 46:16.080]  and and and being control freaks that's why they're really attracted to it like
[46:16.080 --> 46:21.480]  Mazda flame at its heart it's about shutting off the West industry because
[46:21.480 --> 46:25.680]  the globalists in all their admissions say that the wealth engine doesn't make
[46:25.680 --> 46:30.640]  us dependent on socialism they want to shut it down to make a stand-in line like
[46:30.640 --> 46:35.680]  poor Russians to get sausages and nylons here's the answer to this Alex if you go
[46:35.680 --> 46:39.760]  on to science and public policy dot all and download what we're calling the
[46:39.760 --> 46:44.960]  futility report it's done by my colleague Chip Nappenberger and he took my
[46:44.960 --> 46:51.040]  equations on how to work out how much it's costs to make global warming go away
[46:51.040 --> 46:55.000]  and how little global warming you will make to go away if you try to intervene
[46:55.000 --> 46:59.480]  and he has worked out that if you shut down the whole United States from this
[46:59.480 --> 47:06.880]  year then by 2050 in about 40 years time the world would be naught point zero
[47:06.880 --> 47:13.200]  eight Celsius degrees cooler that is a 12th of a Celsius degree a sixth of a
[47:13.200 --> 47:17.800]  Fahrenheit degree cooler than it is today and if you kept on not having a
[47:17.800 --> 47:23.720]  United States for a hundred years until 2100 then the world would be one third
[47:23.720 --> 47:29.020]  of a Fahrenheit degree but then the final key as you know general electric and
[47:29.020 --> 47:33.200]  others they are exempt from having their coal power plant shut down so it's a
[47:33.200 --> 47:38.600]  purely coal-blooded mafia operation to shut down their competition and then
[47:38.600 --> 47:43.440]  they can have artificial scarcity and make you buy from them for three or four
[47:43.440 --> 47:47.480]  times what it previously was that's exactly it and of course all these huge
[47:47.480 --> 47:52.640]  subsidies paid to windmills and solar panels all of that is designed to
[47:52.640 --> 47:57.960]  transfer wealth from taxpayers via these companies into the pockets of the
[47:57.960 --> 48:01.440]  Democrat Party over there the Scott Nats here are doing it so the Labor Party
[48:01.440 --> 48:05.680]  and what is happening is that those who are paying through their higher
[48:05.680 --> 48:10.240]  electricity prices and higher taxes to subsidize these useless windmills the
[48:10.240 --> 48:13.800]  companies that run the windmills are making so much money in subsidy that
[48:13.800 --> 48:18.320]  they are then making donations to the left-wing parties that are pushing some
[48:18.320 --> 48:22.240]  money laundering operation it's a money laundering or so by which taxpayers
[48:22.240 --> 48:26.200]  money ends up in the pockets of the political parties that are backing the
[48:26.200 --> 48:30.080]  environmental movement that's what this is really all about it's a money and
[48:30.080 --> 48:34.920]  power grab by left-wing political parties in the speed because they cannot
[48:34.920 --> 48:40.680]  produce I've never met anyone who is a leftist operative that knows how to tie
[48:40.680 --> 48:45.240]  their shoelaces they are horrible children they can never have a business
[48:45.240 --> 48:52.280]  they are mentally defective midgets who want to run our lives that is exactly
[48:52.280 --> 48:56.320]  the problem we know face these are people who they are intellectual pig
[48:56.320 --> 49:00.120]  mace they've never run so much as a bath for themselves in their lives the
[49:00.120 --> 49:04.040]  second footman does that for them these are useless people they're useless
[49:04.040 --> 49:09.000]  appendages on society who have managed to get themselves into positions of
[49:09.000 --> 49:14.400]  power and they are intent and let's get this clear intent upon shutting down the
[49:14.400 --> 49:19.800]  West if they can without a shot being fired by fooling the political and
[49:19.800 --> 49:24.240]  bureaucratic class into thinking that we have a problem that we don't have and
[49:24.240 --> 49:28.000]  which even if we have this problem addicts of global warming it would
[49:28.000 --> 49:33.280]  still be sure at least ten times cheaper to do nothing about it today and to pay
[49:33.280 --> 49:36.760]  to adapt to any global warming and it's consequences but again it's about them
[49:36.760 --> 49:40.600]  casting themselves as savers of the world and then they can decide who can
[49:40.600 --> 49:45.160]  have a business who can live 220 square foot homes where they charge you giant
[49:45.160 --> 49:48.960]  property taxes on them incredible Lord Monkton thank you for all the time and

[50:35.440 --> 50:40.400]  have the bailouts if we have a carbon tax and a VAT and they will shut our
[50:40.400 --> 50:44.440]  economy down that is their goal these people are not idiots they are

[51:08.920 --> 51:12.880]  life and I know you want them out of your life now I aired part of this right
[51:12.880 --> 51:15.600]  at the first of the show but I want to air this now because this is a very
[51:15.600 --> 51:20.160]  special report that we're premiering here on the radio if you're a prison
[51:20.160 --> 51:26.600]  planet TV viewer we're going to archive it there as well but I break down the
[51:26.600 --> 51:31.200]  Big New Brzezinski panicking the humanity is awakening that's why they're
[51:31.200 --> 51:35.040]  trying to rush the authoritarian takeover now because they know their
[51:35.040 --> 51:39.840]  windows closing but that doesn't mean we're going to win this thing if you
[51:39.840 --> 51:44.360]  don't get angry and get motivated you have got to understand folks that it's
[51:44.360 --> 51:49.840]  not work to fight tyranny it is an absolute directive we didn't ask for
[51:49.840 --> 51:53.280]  this fight we're not looking for it but we are not going to sit here while a
[51:53.280 --> 51:59.560]  bunch of cross-eyed New World Order trash runs our lives it's time to call
[51:59.560 --> 52:04.520]  them out it's time to stop being cowed by them it's time to stop having this
[52:04.520 --> 52:08.960]  Western hospitality we're all supposed to be gentlemanly and bend over to these
[52:08.960 --> 52:15.120]  people it's over it's over it's over say it's over own it I don't believe in
[52:15.120 --> 52:17.880]  magic stuff like the secret and all that you say something that makes it
[52:17.880 --> 52:22.240]  happen if you say something and it's feasible and you work towards it a lot
[52:22.240 --> 52:25.680]  of times what you originally wanted won't happen something even better will
[52:25.680 --> 52:34.960]  happen okay it's very simple and you have got to envision the New World Order
[52:34.960 --> 52:39.480]  and ashes you've got to envision an enlightened empowered society moving
[52:39.480 --> 52:43.240]  towards Thomas Jefferson's dreams of true equality and true freedom through
[52:43.240 --> 52:48.720]  free association not the authoritarianism I have studied the so-called left the
[52:48.720 --> 52:54.040]  right is just another version of them to move you towards the control the left
[52:54.040 --> 52:57.680]  right paradigm is false and that it's controlled but there are real agendas
[52:57.680 --> 53:03.960]  within the left within the right and the so-called left are authoritarian
[53:03.960 --> 53:13.480]  demons who fancy themselves social engineers anthropologist sociologist
[53:13.480 --> 53:16.760]  psychologist who think you're a dumb animal and who think they're programming
[53:16.760 --> 53:23.440]  you these are grasping nothing's these are these are people not meant to be in
[53:23.440 --> 53:30.600]  charge they are not meant to clean toilets they are they are they are
[53:30.600 --> 53:38.400]  Sophistic fake intellectual garbage who hates beauty and who hates strength and
[53:38.400 --> 53:42.920]  who hates wealth they don't care about having the wealth for themselves they
[53:42.920 --> 53:48.120]  want to destroy you misery loves company these people hate themselves and
[53:48.120 --> 53:51.760]  they're not strong enough to realize it and better themselves they want to kill
[53:51.760 --> 53:55.160]  humanity because they want to kill themselves and now I'm telling them
[53:55.160 --> 53:59.440]  their deepest dreams yes you want to kill yourself you hate yourself because you
[53:59.440 --> 54:04.680]  are the trash of the earth and I see you and I know who you are and we are
[54:04.680 --> 54:09.160]  going to get you you understand that you started this you started this with
[54:09.160 --> 54:13.480]  humanity in our species and now the switches are being thrown in human
[54:13.480 --> 54:17.160]  survival mechanisms that you've tried to turn off you just flipped on the other
[54:17.160 --> 54:22.200]  direction and you can feel at a spiritual level our hands wrapping around
[54:22.200 --> 54:27.840]  your little throats you think you're gonna hang us on your little your little
[54:27.840 --> 54:31.360]  petard you think you're gonna hang us in your noose you're gonna fall in your
[54:31.360 --> 54:37.280]  own hole you're gonna find our necks don't break so easily all right let's
[54:37.280 --> 54:40.880]  go ahead and go to this breakdown here's the big new brzezinski panicking
[54:40.880 --> 54:45.840]  stay with us Alex Jones here with some incredibly positive news the big new
[54:45.840 --> 54:50.480]  brzezinski who is a top globalist advisor to David Rockefeller as well as
[54:50.480 --> 54:54.760]  the house of Rothschild recently gave a speech in Poland where he told the
[54:54.760 --> 54:59.880]  global elite that the entire world population is waking up to the external
[54:59.880 --> 55:05.280]  new world order and he went on to even say that political awakening and
[55:05.280 --> 55:12.080]  nationalism and resistance is threatening their takeover of society the
[55:12.080 --> 55:16.280]  full speech is posted in an article at info wars.com by Paul Watson
[55:16.280 --> 55:20.880]  brzezinski populist resistance is derailing the new world order quote
[55:20.880 --> 55:26.080]  rise in political activism a threat to external control during a recent
[55:26.080 --> 55:29.520]  speech in Poland former US National Security Advisers of big new brzezinski
[55:29.520 --> 55:33.960]  warned fellow elitists that worldwide resistance that's a quote movement to
[55:33.960 --> 55:38.480]  external control driven by populist activism is threatening to derail the
[55:38.480 --> 55:43.360]  move towards a new world order now before we show the clip remember Hilary
[55:43.360 --> 55:49.260]  Clinton said the same thing a few years ago that they're losing the info war we
[55:49.260 --> 55:54.360]  are in an information war and we are losing that war I'll be very blunt in
[55:54.360 --> 56:00.560]  my assessment no the US isn't losing the info war the foreign megabanks that
[56:00.560 --> 56:05.440]  brag that they've hijacked our federal government they're beginning to lose the
[56:05.440 --> 56:10.480]  info war worldwide the free peoples of this planet are discovering the private
[56:10.480 --> 56:15.080]  corporate fascistic world government that poses as a liberal socialism and
[56:15.080 --> 56:18.760]  they are waking up to it and resisting it here is a short excerpt from
[56:18.760 --> 56:25.240]  brzezinski speech in recent decades worldwide social change has experienced
[56:25.240 --> 56:30.920]  unprecedented historical acceleration particularly because instant mass
[56:30.920 --> 56:36.240]  communications such as radio television and the internet
[56:36.240 --> 56:44.480]  cumulatively have been stimulating a universal awakening of mass political
[56:44.480 --> 56:52.680]  consciousness persistent and highly motivated populist resistance of
[56:52.680 --> 56:58.560]  politically awakened and historically resentful peoples the external control
[56:58.560 --> 57:05.120]  has proven to be increasingly difficult to suppress two years previous he made
[57:05.120 --> 57:11.240]  similar comments to the council on farm relations of Canada that for the first
[57:11.240 --> 57:20.120]  time in all of human history mankind is politically awakened that's a total new
[57:20.120 --> 57:27.880]  reality and no matter where you go politics is a matter of social engagement
[57:27.880 --> 57:33.440]  and most people know what is generally going on generally going on in the world
[57:33.440 --> 57:41.480]  and are consciously aware of global iniquities inequalities lack of respect
[57:41.480 --> 57:46.760]  exploitation brzezinski's new book that came out earlier this year it's into more
[57:46.760 --> 57:50.960]  detail where he hits the panic button to the elite controllers and tells them
[57:50.960 --> 57:55.760]  they had better wake up and understand humanity is awake and staring so this
[57:55.760 --> 57:59.440]  is some more positive news now normally I don't just believe something
[57:59.440 --> 58:04.360]  brzezinski saying in a speech but I from my own research know that what he's
[58:04.360 --> 58:07.960]  saying is accurate and many globalist white papers that are not meant for
[58:07.960 --> 58:13.280]  public reading but are available are raising the same alarm they know that
[58:13.280 --> 58:19.360]  humanity is waking up to their anti-human anti-family eugenicist agenda so to
[58:19.360 --> 58:23.800]  all the info warriors out there not just in the United States but worldwide we
[58:23.800 --> 58:29.420]  are gaining ground all of the globalist activities to suppress us all of their
[58:29.420 --> 58:34.160]  acceleration of the police state is a sign of their weakness right free
[58:34.160 --> 58:38.560]  humanity is awakened that's right you're listening to this transmission you are
[58:38.560 --> 58:49.000]  the resistance this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:12.480]  ahead and actually punch up here while we can drudge report calm you can see
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:17.760]  paul joseph watson's article is the top story there we're going to be getting
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:24.080]  into some of that report today after mr. farage leaves us black friday gun
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:31.640]  sales hit new record high overwhelming demand crashes fbi background check
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:35.880]  center isn't that convenient so they'll just deny you the second amendment
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:39.480]  because their computers crash who knows if that's even who knows if that's even
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:47.000]  true and we're going to be going over that report as well today hat tip to
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.480]  drudge report dot com for helping get this key news out to everyone because
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:58.040]  after all we are all in this together and then after he leaves us we have John
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:03.440]  McAfee and I've confirmed it's him from beliefs from an undisclosed location
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:08.520]  wanted reportedly for murder and he says he didn't do it and they're basically
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:12.800]  framing him and he said that he got raided by the police and stuff a few
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:18.000]  months before that it's all just been bizarre and yeah I mean I can believe the
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.840]  believes in police are corrupt I have watched them I've probably been to
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:31.840]  police it's not exaggerate eight times in my life and I stay well clear a
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:40.440]  police city formerly British Honduras I stay well away from their police they
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:44.120]  are well known for being about as corrupt as it gets though they're not
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.520]  shaking people down it's just you don't want to mess with them because they've
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:51.840]  got other things that are making them money like narcotics trafficking so
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.200]  they're not really in the business is shaking too many people down but they do
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.840]  do that sometimes the business owners so we're going to be getting the the
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:05.680]  antivirus software maker on with us who is on the lamb you never know who's a
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:09.240]  listener usually we get contacted by famous people they don't want to come
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:13.720]  on the show they just want to hat tip to us and we appreciate that and but we're
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:18.200]  going to be breaking that down with him at the bottom of the hour and then
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:24.360]  coming up Obama to appeal to the nation and the public on fiscal cliff he'll
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:28.600]  want more taxes of course to give to foreign banks and also unexpected data
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:32.120]  from the large Hadron collider suggesting that collisions may be
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:35.040]  producing a new type of matter which is what a lot of scientists said it could
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:38.760]  create a black hole a strange let adding matter and could destroy us and
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:42.440]  they're doing thousands of tests and any of them could destroy us you know they
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:50.360]  had equations for atomic weapons in 1900 Max Planck and others and they've
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.920]  had equations since the 20s for weapons that could destroy the whole planet and
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:57.120]  that's the type of stuff they're looking for with this but the elite says you know
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:02.000]  they're going to do it nevertheless and that ties in with Cambridge University
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  Center will study technologies that pose extinction level risk to humanity and
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:18.960]  Paul Watson has a big article up at info wars dot com breaking that down and
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:24.320]  tying into some of the history of that let me give you some of these headlines
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:31.920]  here experts to study whether robots will exterminate humanity but you might
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:36.760]  have read in our October issue of info wars magazine where we went over all
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:42.040]  the quotes and the information had four separate articles of many others just on
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:47.080]  that subject that's why we said people should give the gift of subscriptions

[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:21.120]  ladies and gentlemen I am your host Alex Jones and we are blasting out
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:27.800]  worldwide here on the syndicated transmission today we are going to have
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:35.600]  the head of the UK Independence Party joining us a Nigel Farage in fact we
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:39.080]  have him online with us right now then I'll get into the economic news and
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:44.280]  other top of world news stories that we're going to be getting to and he
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:51.320]  joins us a Nigel Farage is a UKIP MEP from southeast England and he serves on
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:56.120]  the European Union Parliament and he exposes the fact that it's the EU
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.480]  bureaucrats themselves that actually have set up a dictatorship and the
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:03.200]  parliament itself has become ceremonial and he's now one of the leaders
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:08.320]  worldwide globally even more than Ron Paul when it comes to fighting unelected
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:14.680]  global corporate governance and I wanted to get him on to talk about UKIP also
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:19.320]  under assault and demonization because it's the fastest-growing party second
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:23.120]  largest in the European Union out of England right now as well the systems
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:26.640]  really scared of them but sir you've you've got the floor here thank you for
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.880]  coming on with us tell us where where Europe is right now you've been
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:34.480]  predicting its collapse because of its authoritarianism like the Soviet Union
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:38.400]  now it's openly saying it wants to dissolve whatever sovereignty's left of
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:42.600]  the member states where is the euro right now sir it's a mess I mean the
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:48.080]  currency doesn't work and again today we've had another negotiation he had
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:53.280]  another tens said a tens of billions to be sent to the Greeks not of course but
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:56.960]  that money actually helps the Greek people he gets recycled through the
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:01.400]  Greek government straight back to French and German banks we've got youth
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:07.960]  unemployment now in southern Europe between 50 and 60 percent in those
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:12.400]  southern European countries and a massive north-south split in the European
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:17.360]  Union I mean basically the economic logic says the whole thing's a failure it
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:22.040]  should break up but on the other hand what we have is the political will of
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:26.880]  the project and they have an iron grip at the moment over these ancient
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:32.040]  democracies I'm afraid and they are determined to keep the euro project
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:38.360]  going and their new plan is to strip out any remaining sovereignty that
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:42.800]  existed in those countries and bested with un-elected people based at the
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:48.400]  center it is a recipe for revolution because people simply will not put up
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.280]  with declining living standards being imposed upon them by bureaucrats but they
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:58.560]  can't vote for and they can't remove and you've been in the parliament since
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:06.000]  1999 exposing this is a very quiet voice one of the founders of UK now I
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.160]  mean I see the news reports out of the UK your party is exploding we're gonna get
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:16.880]  to some of the socialist demonization and Marxist demonization of your party
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.960]  that doesn't want 80 plus percent of your laws made by unelected bureaucrats in
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:26.560]  the euro but expanding on this you just hit the key here mr. Faraj joining us
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:31.920]  from England folks that they take the money give it to Greece and recycle it
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.520]  back to the technocratic bankers who are now appointing their own people over at
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:40.920]  Italy over Greece I mean you're one of the leading experts and resistors to
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:45.080]  this can you tell Americans and people in North America but also our listeners
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:50.880]  in Europe and England exactly what we're facing with this euro tyranny and what
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:56.400]  they plan to do if they're not defeated well I mean the fact is that the banking
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:02.000]  system and politics became hand in glove one of the same thing and that's been a
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:08.280]  complete disaster and the amazing thing is I mean we have had elected prime
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:14.720]  ministers in Greece and Italy removed by the bully boy bureaucrats and replaced
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:20.360]  by former Goldman Sachs employees I mean you honestly cannot believe what is
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:25.200]  going on and their plan is to make this whole thing even worse is to make
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:30.720]  elections in countries total irrelevances to build for themselves you
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:35.480]  know big new palaces in Brussels Luxembourg and Strasbourg as if they
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:40.360]  can be the masters and they think in their own sort of Walter Mitty way but
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:45.400]  somehow they are going to become the world's global superpower well they're
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:50.520]  living in dreamland because the internal contradictions of the whole thing
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:56.360]  simply don't work and while they're doing that they're not just taking away
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:01.160]  democratic freedoms they're also stripping out liberty by putting in place a
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:05.680]  system where they can monitor the Internet what they can monitor phone
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:11.960]  calls I mean we are heading in Europe for the Orwellian nightmare and that
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:17.120]  isn't just rhetoric I mean I see the reports constantly where they're getting
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.840]  rid of free speech in the continent they're trying to get rid of free speech
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:26.920]  in the UK they are demonizing people that are just for mild national
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:32.640]  sovereignty for US listeners I would liken you guys to kind of constitutionalist
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:38.000]  Ron Paul asked you were a successful businessman and worked in the markets I
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:44.640]  know in your own right you you come from the real world and then we all watch and
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:49.080]  post it info wars calm the amazing debates you have and when you get up
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:55.520]  there and excoriate the unelected bureaucrats and they laugh at you or try
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:14:01.000]  to censor you and then everything you talk about comes true so so so so tell
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.320]  us what's coming next looking into your very accurate crystal ball what's
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:12.120]  coming next is that despite the problems that Southern Europe has they lack
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:16.440]  leadership to get themselves out of the crisis we will have within the next two
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:21.760]  years under a series of proposals that come from the unelected European
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:28.800]  Commission but supported by the current German government a new form of banking
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:34.920]  Union economic Union fiscal Union political Union and the whole thing
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:42.000]  completely unaccountable to the electors in any member state and I honestly
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.160]  believe that those Southern European countries trapped inside a currency that
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:52.840]  doesn't suit them desperately in need of getting a devaluation and also getting
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:57.240]  back their democracy because of course that acts as a safety valve and I see
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:01.760]  the European monster getting worse over the next two or three years and I see
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:06.800]  the suffering of people in the Mediterranean reaching a real crisis
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:11.480]  point and I think the danger that Southern Europe faces is there could be a
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:16.960]  spark and that spark could lead to something akin to violent revolution
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:23.840]  and I think frankly the the whip hand is now so firmly with the bureaucrats you
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:27.880]  know they hold all the cards that possibly violence is the only way out of
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:32.800]  this Wow unprecedented and I know you've spoken about this but I've read and
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:38.840]  confirmed it Eastern Europe being brought in to the euro many of the
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:47.160]  communists not just socialist operatives and apparatus controllers have now found
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:52.160]  a second unbelievable life in the bureaucracy and are recreating the
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:56.800]  Soviet Union very much say I mean the European Commission in Brussels is
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:00.480]  stuffed with people who before the Berlin Wall came down
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:04.720]  prospered under the old communist system we've had commissioners six
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:09.200]  commissioners here who were actually members of the Soviet Communist Party
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:16.240]  members of that system that murdered 40 million of its own people that led those
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:22.200]  countries to absolute misery and ruin and they've now reinvented themselves and
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:26.840]  frankly what we've got now in Europe and then certainly government from Brussels
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:33.320]  is is an updated form of centralized demand management economy this is the
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:37.480]  new communism of that I have no doubt and when I say that in the parliament
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:41.400]  what I say that when I meet them they look very uncomfortable because they know
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:45.560]  that I'm right what about this new EU symbol I've seen on posters hanging up
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:49.960]  a government buildings that has hammers and sickles on it no I don't you know
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:55.560]  that you know we haven't really reached that stage yet you know what what they're
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:17:00.120]  trying to do is to impose their flag you know the flag that the Ryder Cup team
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:04.600]  had sorry to sort of put a sore point on America but but the Ryder Cup team even
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:09.560]  had that flag the blue flag with the 12 stars that's the symbol that really
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:16.320]  matters to them and they think that we in Europe are going to swear allegiance to
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:20.920]  that flag well we're not we're too different we're too diverse we speak
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.400]  different languages we have different histories and cultures and the attempt to
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:31.160]  impose a false nationality upon us is going to lead to sure obviously it's
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:37.440]  all over the UK papers a UKIP foster couple agony children taken council
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:40.720]  tells them they're racist because they're part of UKIP I mean this is
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:47.440]  incredible slander libel defamation it is what happened is truly astonishing a
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:52.600]  couple in their late 50s who have been fostering for the last seven years and
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:59.160]  apparently doing it very well are both members of UKIP activists in UKIP and they
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:04.720]  currently had in their charge three young kids from very difficult backgrounds
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:09.120]  who happen to come from an Eastern European origin and they were doing well
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:12.720]  with these kids you know by all accounts they were doing very well with these kids
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:17.280]  these kids were learning English these kids were getting on and there was the
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:21.880]  knock at the door and the knock on the door from the council officials said we
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:27.120]  have been tipped off that your members of UKIP it is if it's sort of Eastern
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:31.760]  Germany isn't it you know and we believe you're party to be racist and
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:36.920]  therefore it is inconsistent and wrong do you have these children and so these
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:41.560]  three kids were taken away from this couple that were giving them love
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:45.680]  affection helping them to get on with the real world they've been placed
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:50.640]  elsewhere they've been split up which makes it even worse and these two
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:55.840]  decent people just because they support a party that says we should not be part
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:01.120]  of this European monster but whilst we have no prejudice against anybody from
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:06.320]  anybody in the world we ought to have a degree of immigration controls about who
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:12.280]  come into Britain these people have been slandered and it is I think just about
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:17.120]  the most revolting case I can see in modern Britain of an absolutely mad
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:22.680]  socialist Marxist mindset that is taken over local government in Britain but
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:27.760]  there is one piece of good news about it and that is that the whole country is
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:33.480]  absolutely revolting by what has happened and they won't apologize let me
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:35.880]  talk to you in the bright and see if you can do five more minutes to finish this

[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:22.440]  that bragged that conquered Europe and the US I mean there's headlines where
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:26.800]  they brag they took us over by fraud by derivatives now you'll know that Nigel
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:30.920]  Farage a member of the European Union Parliament hailing from England from the
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:37.520]  UK is our champion over there I mean he's the Ron Paul in Europe and we're
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:41.600]  just so honored to have him here with us in this short final segment and another
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:45.600]  guest is joining us and of course it was two years ago that he survived an
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:50.680]  incredible plane crash what back on May 6 2010 will actually put that news
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:55.880]  article up on screen for people just unbelievable photos of the plane upside
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:00.960]  down with him in the pilot and then he actually walked out of it just absolutely
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:06.960]  brutal photos that will scroll through there for people but you've got the
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:10.320]  foresir and the time we've got left here finishing up with this with this
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:15.680]  family and this new attempt to demonize that you're not putting a good face on
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:21.200]  it it has absolutely backfired in every newspaper I've seen oh without a doubt
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:26.320]  I mean everybody even the left-wing press and saying this has gone too far this
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:31.880]  is disgusting the trouble is whilst there is a wall of support for what we've
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:35.320]  had to say and for this
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:41.560]  the council in Yorkshire who did this have announced there'll be an inquiry now
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:45.920]  on the face of it that sounds good but really this is just kicking the can down
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:51.440]  the road I want an apology for these parents I want those kids to be brought
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:56.520]  back together and returned I want these people pardoned and I want heads to roll
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:01.160]  and it just shows you how government works in the western world now the
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:05.320]  woman who made the decision to take those kids away working for a local
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:10.800]  council in a small English provincial town is paid a salary of a hundred and
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:16.600]  thirty thousand pounds a year that's two hundred thousand dollars a year this woman gets paid to
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:20.880]  look after kids in Roboram and I want to have to be sacked I want to head to roll
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:26.760]  and if we don't get the right address from all of this then I will on behalf of
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:31.600]  this couple take legal action because people like this just must not be allowed
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:37.120]  to be bullied with the state this case sums up just what goes wrong we're very
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:41.080]  very close now to having a thought please in our country and I'm gonna fight it
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:46.600]  with all my might it's Joyce Thacker director of children's services for
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.960]  rather ham council and again this isn't you saying they took the kids because
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:58.200]  they were constitutional you know pro-uk sovereignty sanity just mainline good
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:03.480]  libertarian folks but I mean if they took these from bad people who you know
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:07.880]  are white supremacist or black supremacist still you don't take their kids now
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:13.560]  we've gotten to the point where they're proud of it and are saying that this is
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:18.920]  the way it is this is the thought police yeah it is I mean it really is I mean
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:23.920]  this is the Orwellian nightmare come true this I think this case illustrates
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:30.400]  just how bad just how rotten things have become but listen I'm gonna do my best
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:35.560]  to make sure Joyce Thacker loses that big salary she gets but not looking after
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:41.240]  kids in Rotherham and I want this decent couple you're really good people who
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:46.840]  society needs and I want them pardoned back on the foster register I think also
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:49.760]  they probably deserve a bit of compensation for what they've been
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:55.760]  through but again they intend to stick to their guns saying that one of the
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:01.000]  biggest parties in the UK is evil I mean it's clear that if these people have
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.320]  their way I mean I see them all the time calling in in the UK for the arrest of
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:08.200]  people that don't believe in man-made global warming who don't want to pay
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:13.480]  Al Gore money yeah well I mean you know there is a huge ideological war isn't
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:17.480]  there that's going on here between those of us that believe in free speech and
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:22.120]  liberty and the right that we can agree and disagree on things and this new
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:28.600]  horrible bureaucratic monstrous state that is got beyond the democratic process
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:33.840]  and I mean offense you know this case in Rotherham is just a little small
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:38.440]  example of my bigger battle against the whole European monster it's about
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:44.360]  frankly I believe Alex it is about the battle between good and evil it is in
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:47.440]  the one minute we've got left how do people get involved who are listening
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:52.720]  in the UK to UKIP and people in Europe who want to export these ideas of
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:57.680]  freedom against the ideas of carrying absolutely it's this battle is as
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:02.200]  important in every other European country is it is in the United Kingdom if
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:07.080]  you look at UKIP.org you'll see what we're doing it's a good website it's
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:12.440]  updated every day we are the campaign for truth and liberty we've got the
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:17.320]  establishment in Westminster absolutely terrified of us and you know what
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:22.680]  we haven't even started yet. Worldwide people are waking up to the globalist

[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:47.880]  on with us. I think Thursday he's got his national tour going around the
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:52.160]  country. Always great to have my friend Joe Rogan on the show, but it's funny I
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:57.440]  talked to Joe this morning and then separately talked to John McAfee and he
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:00.400]  was telling me he was gonna be on Joe's show. It's just a plug there. I hope they
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:04.280]  don't come after him. He's been on the phone with a Forbes writer when the police
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:09.520]  show up with armed men and he's offering a huge reward to find out who really
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:15.440]  killed the person in police that they're saying he's the main suspect in and
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:20.000]  of course he's the inventor of one of the most well-known antivirus software,
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.760]  John McAfee and he worked for Lockheed until 87 then ventured into the
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:30.920]  antivirus business. One of the first people to understand that that was
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:38.240]  an obvious problem out there with the viruses and he joins us now. He's been
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:41.360]  on many TV shows with his different businesses down in police for tourists
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:46.360]  and things and then he got raided by police in a bizarre event and then now
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:50.520]  they're saying down there in the piratical area of former British
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:54.920]  Honduras what is police. Beautiful area. I've been there many times that he's the
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:59.600]  murder suspect. Now most of you probably already know that. John McAfee from
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:06.280]  Tech Pioneer to Murder Suspect is one of the headlines. McAfee on the run murder
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:10.480]  and mayhem but few taxes in police that's Forbes. The continuing story of
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:19.280]  John McAfee is told by John McAfee so he is speaking out and McAfee's former
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:23.960]  girlfriend says the internet pioneer is fighting for his life and he is on with
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:27.360]  us today. Sir thank you for reaching out to us because I have to tell you when I
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:31.280]  saw this break in the last few weeks I was like that sounds like pure bull to
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:36.000]  me that you know what they're saying happened plus the believes in police
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.480]  I've only been on there eight or nine times and but I've read about it I mean
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:43.320]  they're well known for being pretty darn corrupt but I've seen them do some
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:46.800]  shady things in police city but enough of me you've got the floor good to have
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:50.760]  you here start at the beginning tell us what really happened or as best you can
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:55.440]  tell and where all this is going and about the reward that people can find
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:36:00.600]  there on your website that I'll also put up on screen. Well thank you Alex I'm
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:06.000]  really happy to be here this this breaks my boredom tremendously I've been
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.920]  living in a very constrained environment for a while so this is quite a thrill
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:15.360]  for me. Okay where did it started? It started the last day of April of this
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:19.440]  year when at six in the morning I was woken up to the sound of bull horns
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:27.720]  dogs barking and gunfire and got out of bed stalk-raving naked went out on my
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:32.640]  porch and saw 42 armed soldiers with automatic weapons in full right here
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:38.640]  storming my property I had a when I heard the commotion I picked up a handgun
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:42.840]  which I keep for protection I put the handgun down on the step went back
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:48.000]  inside put my pants on woke up my girlfriend she got up calmly got dressed
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.120]  sat on the edge of the bed I went outside was grabbed by a bunch of people
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:56.440]  slammed up against the wall and told that they were there with a search warrant
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:02.080]  for an illegal meth lab meth meaning methamphetamines I was handcuffed held
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:06.720]  in the Sun for 14 hours without food and water both at one point I did ask for
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:11.920]  some water and some food for the people who were arrested with me the the
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:17.320]  soldiers standing nearby said do I look like a chef to you indeed he did not
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:21.720]  look like a chef so it was my mistake in any case they hauled me off to the
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:26.800]  Blee City Jail I spent six hours sleeping on a concrete floor and was
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:32.040]  finally released with no charges being filed the following day I asked for
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:37.520]  publicly a apology from the prime minister who privately responded who
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:41.920]  does he think he is to his close confidants that was the beginning of my
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:46.280]  story since that time I've had nothing but harassment from the from the
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:50.840]  authorities here they've attempted to charge me with a variety of charges the
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:56.320]  very first was running an antibiotic laboratory without a license that didn't
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:00.320]  go very far because what I was working on was actually a topical antiseptic
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:04.760]  not of an antibiotic which we take systemically and by the way before this
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:08.960]  interview I did some more research on you they've had national TV shows here in
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.640]  the US about the little laboratory you've got that's discovering things in
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:18.680]  the rainforest and patenting plant derivatives and things so you're an
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:22.520]  entrepreneur down there well respected because I did a lot of research before
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:26.520]  we did this interview and it really does look like they're targeting you why do
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:31.960]  you think they began to come after you I have not played by the rules the rules
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:35.960]  and beliefs are if you are rich far near you have to pay your dues and you pay
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:41.280]  them to the to the higher ups and in the government the high officials I've
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:46.280]  donated about seven million dollars worth of gear to every aspect of the
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:52.320]  police economy the police force to schools to charity organizations you
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:56.640]  name it but my donations rather than giving the money to the government and
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:00.440]  letting them go without where ninety percent of it goes to the families of
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:05.520]  the officials I donate directly for example I bought boots for the entire
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:09.840]  orange walk police department I got their sizes first bought them and and
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:14.880]  requested an inventory of who they went to now there's no way for the government
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:19.840]  to skim anything from that I built a police station for the village of
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:25.040]  Carmelita a very nice police station there you go I mean you're as successful as they
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:28.480]  did not like that because I should have given the government the money and let
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:32.000]  the government build the police station so I'm not playing by the rules I
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.440]  refuse to donate to either political party the current party sent just prior
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:41.640]  to the last election as a few months before I was rated by the way an
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:46.560]  envoy demanding of a large sum of money in exchange for which I would be treated
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:51.440]  very nicely I ordered them off of my property that was a serious mistake
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:55.880]  foolishness of you can attribute it to my advancing age but that was the
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:00.600]  beginning of my trouble amazing so you're a well-known inventor well-known
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:05.880]  businessmen started all sorts of tourist businesses tours you name it all over
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:11.120]  the islands and you were not being shaken down kind of like our founding
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:15.560]  fathers didn't want it to be shaken down and so they've started trying to set
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:20.040]  you up and now there was a murder and it's convenient and they want to
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:23.960]  basically send you down the river I mean is that a fair assumption of what
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:28.520]  you're what your side of the story is I would say it's exactly my side of the
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:32.960]  story and basically they they're opportunists somebody's murdered white
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:36.680]  next door to me a lot like next door a few hundred yards down the beach
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:45.920]  perfect let's grab the bastard amazing absolutely amazing I mean most people
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:49.240]  know the story it's been one of the biggest stories the last few weeks and
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:52.400]  here you are you've been communicating via text and things now you're on the
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:57.480]  air obviously national media is going to be tuning into this a what do you want
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:01.320]  to say to the national media be what do you want to say to the Malaysian
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:05.880]  authorities if you can call the CD operators that what would you like to
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:10.840]  say to them as well and then where do you want to see all this go okay well
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:13.960]  first of all it's what I'd like to say to the national media is number one I'd
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:18.640]  like to make an apology to Jeff Wise the the intrepid reporter who has been
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:24.280]  bulldogging my ass for two and a half years now for unknown reasons in an
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:30.200]  effort to understand his his animosity I confused him with yet another
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:35.240]  reporter that reported on my flying activities in New Mexico during that
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:41.240]  time I did probably 20 magazine interviews I publicly stated that Jeff
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:45.680]  had acted improperly to one of the women unfortunately why I was gonna actually
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:49.360]  post the picture when I got the picture it was a different different reporter
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:53.800]  okay you're correcting that that's good I'm going to answer no no so you're
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:57.800]  correcting that now I'm correcting that my policy to the rest of the media I
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:03.720]  would say get a life let's do some real reporting nothing everything in the
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:08.040]  national media is basically regurgitating what somebody else has said so
[01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:12.280]  we're not getting the news third hand we're getting it 50 at hand so get a
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:17.640]  life get a job a real job to the police and authorities please take a look in
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:22.120]  the mirror as to where this is heading sir I have no clue I'm playing this I'm
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:26.920]  flying this by the seat of my pants and taking this a moment at a time now what's
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:30.560]  the best website for people to visit to find your side of the story in text and
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:37.200]  also find out about the reward the best website is who is McAfee.com it's my
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:43.680]  blog also we have an official Twitter site this is called official McAfee I
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:49.600]  very strongly would advise people to go to the to my blog site who is McAfee.com
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:55.240]  to get my side of the events and also three of my best friends have also been
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:59.120]  arrested on my behalf unfortunately but this is the way they do it here in
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:02.280]  police if they can't grab you they grab your friends your wife if they can grab
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:06.280]  them your children and arrest them they have been arrested and are being held
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:11.240]  in prison unjustly on my website or all the email addresses that you can write
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:15.600]  to please please demand their release they have nothing whatsoever to do with
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:20.680]  anything well again sir I want to believe you you sound legitimate to me I
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:24.440]  already knew who you were I did some research I also again have been to
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:28.640]  police many times as I was a child and my father's been down there even more to
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:32.120]  scuba dive with my mother and he researched the area and talked to
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:36.120]  friends that live down there over the years who left saying that even if you
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:39.280]  don't have a lot of money now the government tries to shake you down the
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.600]  people overall are pretty good folks but it is a famous you know kind of pirate
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:48.960]  Cove archipelago of islands down there and so that's why I tend to lean towards
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:52.720]  believing what you're saying knowing what I know about the so-called
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:56.760]  Malaysian government that might as well have the Jolly Roger as their official
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:44:03.640]  symbol but any other points you'd like to make on that front and I mean obviously
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:07.600]  you don't want to get into how you're evading specifically but first tell us
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:14.160]  about the the reward okay I've offered a $25,000 police reward for any
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:18.040]  information leading to the arrest and conviction of the real killer of Mr.
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:23.320]  Fault that's obviously in my interest but I'm not doing it out of altruism I
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:27.960]  don't quite believe in altruism but I'm a man of my word if someone provides
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:32.040]  information which does get the real killer you will get the money that's
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:36.120]  your first question about the Jolly Roger keep in mind police was founded as
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:42.160]  a pirate colony and for 200 years it had no flag other than the Jolly
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:46.480]  Roger the British when they took it over didn't really take it over as a
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:49.680]  country they they were actually helping the pirates because the pirates
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:54.040]  attacked the Spanish Jalons coming from South America that had to go right by
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:58.440]  the reef outside and so they were of the police was a benefit to the British
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:04.080]  and continued to be a benefit up until the 1950s and that's when England
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:08.200]  abandoned it as with many colonies that England has abandoned of self
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:15.480]  governance is not as easy as it first appears no kidding continuing here I
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:19.360]  could ask so many questions and I will but what else do you I mean obviously
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:22.920]  you're you're now just not writing on your blog you've reached out to mfo
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:30.240]  wars.com to speak to folks why did you reach out to us I'll be frank with you
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:35.280]  sir my advice is suggested it this is the very first time I've had contact
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:39.840]  with you so not because of disinterest but because the bandwidth here in this
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:43.200]  country does not support thought no no I understand large okay I just didn't
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:47.520]  reach out to us I'm surprised you have not asked about drug use of the the
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:53.200]  famous blue right blue light hoax that that occurred earlier in the year the
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:58.520]  intimidation said I am on a substance called MDPV you've asked some very
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:03.040]  soft questions so far sir I would suggest moving to hardball okay well no I
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:06.680]  mean it's not that it's just that we we've seen all the demonization in the
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:10.920]  media and so I always go with a little guy because it's better that 10 guilty
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:15.440]  men go free than one innocent man go to jail so I kind of take the defense
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:20.400]  attorney position in life because I because I grew up seeing the system
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:24.560]  posing as good guys generally being the bad guys now now maybe my life
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:28.760]  experiences stewed me towards always being for the underdog I just wanted to
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:33.240]  since you contacted us I wanted to give you a chance to you know to basically
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:37.400]  lay out all your points before we got into any new
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:42.840]  hardball questions as you call them all right I think my points have been laid
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:47.240]  out and and I have appreciated that opportunity sir so well okay let's get
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:51.600]  into a standard let's get into standard media questions then where are you right
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:55.360]  now how are you hiding now how dare you kill that man I mean if you want those
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:59.160]  type of questions you know you did it Maccabee just turn yourself in it'll go
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:03.600]  easier on you come out with your hands up sure sure no no seriously how are you
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:07.840]  evading these guys so successfully number one I did not care almost the
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:12.600]  fault that's the most absurd allegation of my entire life number two I really
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:18.440]  cannot say anything about where I am how I've evaded detection what I look like
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:23.600]  or anything else I apologize for being evasive but by saying something on a
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:27.920]  show of your size I know for fact the abolition authorities are listening as
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:32.200]  we speak so please forgive me for no no no and listen I was playing devil's
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:36.080]  advocate I mean obviously you are a innocent man until proven guilty and I
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:39.080]  don't I don't think you would do this I don't think you go down the beach and
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:43.840]  you know kill somebody you know when you have so much to lose and I don't trust
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:49.440]  the the ablesion authorities but obviously people are wondering well you
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:54.160]  told me off there you just said somebody of quote your age who's been around
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:48:00.040]  certainly knows how to to hide out and I guess your point is you know that your
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:05.160]  street wise I am street wise the first half of my life was spent sort of on
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:12.760]  the street so I've been 33 or 34 years ago my life changed radically hopefully
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:18.400]  for the better when I stopped using drugs I stopped drinking alcohol I have
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:22.840]  not had a sip of wine beer or anything else in and over 30 years and I haven't
[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:27.240]  taken drugs in that period of time if I will be honest I if I have started
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:31.280]  smoking cigarettes again which some people call a drug and I will pass up to
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:36.160]  that why do you think they're claiming in the media yes sir sure sure and I
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:40.760]  also drink coffee which contains caffeine which if you have four or five
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:45.240]  espressos is a pretty speedy hit but beyond that that's the that's the extent
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:52.760]  of my my drug use what would you like to see best case scenario them start a real
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:58.760]  investigation instead of just saying you did it well I would love a real
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:02.440]  investigation however it's not in the government's interest if the real
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:08.960]  murderer is found then suddenly this whole opportunity to remove McAfee as a
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:14.400]  major thorn in the government side simply disappears now again you've had
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:18.120]  national media in your lab but you were I've seen the newscast you're very
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:22.360]  proud of what you develop your I mean you've told the press that you believe
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:27.680]  it's when you came up with this tropical antiseptic that that they wanted or a
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:34.040]  topical antiseptic that they came after you well at that point obviously had I
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:37.520]  continued it been successful it would have been you know a multi-billion dollar
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:43.600]  company and the government would want their dues however it became also clear
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:48.760]  that I'm not a game player not by the game that's that's played here and that
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:52.360]  just pissed everybody off it's not the way the system works the government
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:57.520]  allows you to do something and in exchange you have to pay up I don't mind
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:01.160]  doing that if you want to do it in the form of taxes and tax everyone I don't
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:05.800]  care how unjustly or how stupid it may be but for someone to come and say here
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:10.440]  give me five million dollars you know that doesn't cut it you know my answers
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:14.920]  get the fuck off my property excuse my language sir no no and I've been reading
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:19.720]  news articles where they do talk about claiming that you were on a forum bragging
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:23.640]  that you develop some new drug that you were on I mean anybody could go to a
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:28.880]  forum and say that I in fact they do do stuff like that that that I'm developing
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:31.760]  a drug in fact I've had him say that about me had to sue somebody one time
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:36.160]  saying just making it up I mean I've never been involved in any drugs period

[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:40.080]  all right John McAfee sex drugs and antivirus software and there he is
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:46.520]  looking like the older brother a Rob Zombie with his 12 gauge shotgun and a
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:50.360]  smile on his face it looks like you know for Guy Eurasial here in pretty good
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:54.000]  shape buddy looks like he were having a little too much fun down there but you
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.400]  say you didn't kill this guy you know nothing about it how how were you able
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:01.760]  to get the heads up and get away from them before they came and threw you in
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:03.760]  their believes in jail
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:07.440]  I saw the police coming up the beach
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:10.960]  they're remarkably inept when it comes to hiding themselves
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:14.640]  well sure and instead and you'd already been harassed by him quite a bit
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:17.320]  so I guess you knew to get out of there
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:18.680]  I did I did
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:21.080]  okay specifically
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:24.440]  we were talking during the break why why are you reaching out to Joe Rogan
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:28.400]  Alex Jones and why are you going with alternative media
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:33.280]  okay I'm reaching out to both you and Joe because my advisors suggested it to be
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:38.200]  really frank I've never heard your show before nor nor um Joe Rogan's again not
[01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:41.680]  because of this interest but because we know that's a good place to go because
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:45.480]  we're at least real people and I'm on there but the internet because if you
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:49.520]  look at traditional news traditional media it's nothing more than regurgitation
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:54.440]  of what's been said whereas on the internet you are more real-time if you
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:59.360]  have access to more facilities and it tends to be a little tourist story
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:04.080]  yeah I mean exactly because I don't have so many pulling my strings and I can
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:08.240]  tell you big network people they've got people pulling their strings they're
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:11.000]  reading off teleprompter so at least here we're having a real discussion you
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.120]  know person-to-person man-to-man now expanding I guess I'll put my foot in
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:17.640]  my mouth because I mean I wouldn't make these statements you say you don't use
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:21.840]  drugs so why why are you on a drug form making these comments I made the leap
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:25.200]  but then I see how ridiculous the comments are it makes sense you were
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:31.400]  being sarcastic tell folks about the MP the MD PV you you were making jokes
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:36.040]  about bath salts right I'm actually making jokes it was I was trying to
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:40.480]  sound as serious as possible to tell the story about ten years ago a drug showed
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:46.520]  up in Europe called MDPV10 MDPV stands for methylene-dioxy pyrotechnic
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:52.120]  I wrote valor wrong the drug was the magical sex drug
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:56.820]  it's what the worlds been looking for is the ultimate marital aid it was
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:57:01.340]  obviously a made up story but millions of people believed it they kept talking
[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:04.200]  about it they were still talking about it on blue light which is the world's
[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:09.720]  largest drug form board unobserve friend I went online and created a thread
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:15.060]  that went on for more than 1,000 posts that was such is so absurdly false nothing
[01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:22.220]  If I had rediscovered MDPV10, I wouldn't be going to manufacture it.
[01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:28.500]  I would take a sample of the formula, walk into the Bayer offices, you know, and the
[01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:32.460]  president of the company on his knees would hand me a check for a billion dollars while
[01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:34.460]  he was muttering, the world is ours.
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:36.580]  I mean, it's absurd, totally absurd.
[01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:42.540]  Well, that may be why you got rated because the idiot believes your authorities knew you
[01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:46.100]  were running a laboratory, you've been on the news about it, they probably thought you
[01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:48.540]  had it and were going to torture you to get it.
[01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:53.540]  Well, thank God they didn't torture me, I got out of jail in time and took refuge on
[01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:54.540]  the island.
[01:57:54.540 --> 01:57:59.260]  But it was so obviously a prank, so obviously, because that board does have legitimate chemists
[01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:00.260]  on it.
[01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:03.620]  All a couple of hundred of them who were reading it, they all said, this is a hoax, people
[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:08.260]  don't believe this crap, and so they left, but the rank and file, they just kept the thing
[01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:09.260]  going.
[01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:12.260]  I mean, anybody who reads it can, will know, obviously, you know, my gut tells me that.
[01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:17.620]  My gut tells me that you screwed around about this kind of things, but my God, have I developed
[01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:18.620]  that?
[01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:19.620]  Have I rediscovered the formula?
[01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:21.260]  Trust me, I wouldn't be sitting here.
[01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:22.260]  Sure, my gut tells me.
[01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:25.620]  I'm a Bayer executive, not having to work.

[01:59:53.980 --> 02:00:05.740]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:10.540]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:11.540]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:13.860]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:17.860]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:22.740]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:33.020]  Do I 100% believe John McAfee did not commit this murder that he's alleged to have committed
[02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:34.820]  by the Belasian Policies?
[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:40.340]  No, but do I put any stock in the Belasian government?
[02:00:40.340 --> 02:00:42.100]  The answer is absolutely not.
[02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:48.060]  And my gut tells me that he's a very eccentric person, but there is something else afoot
[02:00:48.060 --> 02:00:49.060]  here.
[02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:56.580]  Now, I could be wrong, but I am certainly more than happy to let this gentleman be heard,
[02:00:56.580 --> 02:01:00.900]  and we're glad that he chose this broadcast to do it first, other than text that he's
[02:01:00.900 --> 02:01:02.980]  been having with the media.
[02:01:02.980 --> 02:01:07.640]  And I should, in the time we've got left, Twitter, go to twitter.com forward slash real
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:08.640]  Alex Jones.
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:12.820]  I could pull this up during the break, tweet me, and then guys print them off for me, because
[02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:15.420]  I'll be busy trying to go through them, then I won't get to it.
[02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:20.060]  Tweet right now to real Alex Jones, or I guess we should tweet out questions for John
[02:01:20.060 --> 02:01:23.260]  McAfee to real Alex Jones, if you've got a few questions for him.
[02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:26.500]  But repeat to me, sir, what you just said in that one minute break as we ended the last
[02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:31.980]  hour, I said, who do you think killed Gregory Fall, the guy that was down the beach from
[02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:32.980]  you?
[02:01:32.980 --> 02:01:34.620]  And you had a very interesting answer.
[02:01:34.620 --> 02:01:35.620]  Please repeat that.
[02:01:35.620 --> 02:01:36.620]  Okay.
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:42.580]  The first thing that came to my mind, and this perhaps, you know, bolsters those who say
[02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:47.540]  I am paranoid, my first thought was that the government had sent someone to kill me, pretending
[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:53.460]  it would be a robbery, and they simply got the wrong white man and got a neighbor instead.
[02:01:53.460 --> 02:01:58.380]  That thought didn't stay for long, but quite frankly, sir, I have no idea who killed Mr.
[02:01:58.380 --> 02:01:59.380]  Fall.
[02:01:59.380 --> 02:02:04.260]  I mean, why would you kill Mr. Fall when you've got all these beautiful boats and businesses
[02:02:04.260 --> 02:02:05.740]  and all this money?
[02:02:05.740 --> 02:02:09.060]  I mean, you sold what your antivirus company for a hundred million.
[02:02:09.060 --> 02:02:13.420]  I mean, why on earth, you know, you're down there, you look happy in these photos.
[02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:16.940]  Why on earth would you go down the beach and blow your neighbor away?
[02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:18.940]  That's the entire point.
[02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:19.940]  I barely knew my neighbor.
[02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:22.460]  Now, to be frank, he was not my favorite character.
[02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:23.460]  He drank a lot.
[02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:25.460]  He did not like my dogs.
[02:02:25.460 --> 02:02:27.460]  They barked a lot at night and annoyed him.
[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:31.460]  And to be frank, they annoyed me, too, and I fully sympathize with him.
[02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:33.460]  Yeah, my dogs annoyed me, too.
[02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:39.220]  My dogs were poisoned, by the way, the night before, and I had to put four of them down.
[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:41.260]  But Mr. Fall also had dogs.
[02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:42.740]  Dog lovers do not kill dogs.
[02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:43.740]  This is a fact of life.
[02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:45.740]  If you have a dog, you know this is a fact, sir.
[02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:46.740]  No, I agree.
[02:02:46.740 --> 02:02:51.060]  It could not have been Mr. Fall who killed my dogs, and that is what the government is
[02:02:51.060 --> 02:02:57.940]  saying, that because he poisoned my dogs, I then shot him.
[02:02:57.940 --> 02:03:02.340]  I can't think of anything more absurd.
[02:03:02.340 --> 02:03:03.740]  So you are innocent.
[02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:04.740]  Tell people.
[02:03:04.740 --> 02:03:05.740]  I mean, state it.
[02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:06.740]  People want to hear it, in your words.
[02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:07.740]  Well, I am innocent.
[02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:08.740]  I am absolutely innocent.
[02:03:08.740 --> 02:03:13.740]  It is not something that I would ever do to anyone under any circumstances.
[02:03:13.740 --> 02:03:18.860]  I mean, if I really were that pissed at someone, I would want them alive so that I could continue
[02:03:18.860 --> 02:03:20.340]  to torment them in other ways.
[02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:22.580]  I mean, it is totally ridiculous.
[02:03:22.580 --> 02:03:27.580]  Yeah, I mean, I will tell you right now, if somebody poisoned my dogs, I would find them,
[02:03:27.580 --> 02:03:29.980]  and I would say, okay, get ready for a fist fight.
[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:32.300]  I would say, put your fist up, punk.
[02:03:32.300 --> 02:03:34.660]  And I would probably get in a fight with them.
[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:35.980]  I certainly wouldn't kill somebody.
[02:03:35.980 --> 02:03:40.980]  Actually, my Chihuahua is 15 years old, and I love it, but I might give them a check if
[02:03:40.980 --> 02:03:41.980]  they killed it.
[02:03:41.980 --> 02:03:42.980]  I am joking.
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:43.980]  I am sorry.
[02:03:43.980 --> 02:03:45.620]  I know that you are joking, sir.
[02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:46.620]  No, I am being so...
[02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:49.340]  Well, sometimes, I tell you, that dog is barking at 3 a.m.
[02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:50.340]  I love the dog, though.
[02:03:50.340 --> 02:03:51.340]  It is like an heirloom.
[02:03:51.340 --> 02:03:55.700]  It was a year old when I met my wife, and now it is 15 years old, and blind, and stumbles
[02:03:55.700 --> 02:03:57.540]  around all over the house urinating on the rugs.
[02:03:57.540 --> 02:04:01.260]  But anyway, side issue, sir, we have got a final segment coming up.
[02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:03.260]  What do you want to cover when we come back?
[02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:04.260]  Anything you want.
[02:04:04.260 --> 02:04:06.580]  I understand that you just tweeted for questions.
[02:04:06.580 --> 02:04:09.860]  I can assure you some of those were going to be very intense.
[02:04:09.860 --> 02:04:10.860]  Can you please...
[02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:13.420]  The ones that would paint me in the worst light, sir?
[02:04:13.420 --> 02:04:14.420]  Yes.
[02:04:14.420 --> 02:04:17.060]  Why did you want me to be more aggressive earlier against you?
[02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:20.300]  I mean, is that... You know, you... Not only because I didn't want it to come
[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:21.300]  up.
[02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:26.420]  I don't want the program to come up sounding like, you know, that this was the one-sided
[02:04:26.420 --> 02:04:27.420]  program.
[02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:30.460]  I think programs that present two sides are always better.
[02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:32.180]  No, no, I agree with you, but here's the deal.
[02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:35.660]  There's a guy who had two teens break in his house in Minnesota.
[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:36.660]  He shot one.
[02:04:36.660 --> 02:04:38.700]  They started laughing, which I believe that's how trendy's are.
[02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:41.100]  They think if they laugh, something isn't real.
[02:04:41.100 --> 02:04:42.100]  So he shot him again.
[02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:44.100]  They're charging him with murder.
[02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:47.620]  They're going to use that to take my right to shoot people that come in my house, because
[02:04:47.620 --> 02:04:50.980]  the guy said, yeah, I probably shouldn't have shot him that many times.
[02:04:50.980 --> 02:04:55.980]  If you're innocent, bro, you don't need to show both sides and show you're reasonable.
[02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:58.020]  The system's going to use that against you.
[02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:00.020]  You should just stick to the facts.
[02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:03.020]  Yes, sir.
[02:05:03.020 --> 02:05:09.220]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal
[02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:10.980]  Bend Soap Company.
[02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:15.220]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[02:05:15.220 --> 02:05:19.980]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils
[02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:22.500]  that are earth-friendly and safe.
[02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:30.340]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:35.100]  Buy the one to two-month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what
[02:05:35.100 --> 02:05:40.860]  you're using now, or save big with a one to two-year supply of soaps for all your cleaning
[02:05:40.860 --> 02:05:41.860]  needs.
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:43.700]  This is an amazing deal.
[02:05:43.700 --> 02:05:48.940]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[02:05:48.940 --> 02:05:57.060]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:05:57.060 --> 02:06:04.820]  Sick of the globalist eugenesis control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as
[02:06:04.820 --> 02:06:06.340]  you get sick and die?
[02:06:06.340 --> 02:06:08.540]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:06:08.540 --> 02:06:13.180]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there, Bar None,
[02:06:13.180 --> 02:06:17.700]  is ProPure and it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:21.180]  Its filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:06:21.180 --> 02:06:22.860]  There's no priming required.
[02:06:22.860 --> 02:06:25.340]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:28.500]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:31.900]  Easy to set up and use, doesn't require electricity.
[02:06:31.900 --> 02:06:34.820]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds and wells.
[02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:38.260]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:06:38.260 --> 02:06:42.620]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leashes from the plastic.
[02:06:42.620 --> 02:06:45.020]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:06:45.020 --> 02:06:46.980]  It's what my family uses.
[02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:51.300]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure, but if you add the promo code
[02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:55.740]  WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at infowars.com.
[02:06:55.740 --> 02:07:00.380]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:03.500]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:05.380]  Even save money on your electric bill.
[02:07:05.380 --> 02:07:09.220]  If so, this could be one of the most important messages you will ever hear.
[02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:11.260]  Solar power generators are now available.
[02:07:11.260 --> 02:07:14.820]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:20.020]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes and produces electricity
[02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:21.020]  from the sun.
[02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:24.740]  It's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:29.380]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers and even keep your food from spoiling.
[02:07:29.380 --> 02:07:33.620]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never suffer through
[02:07:33.620 --> 02:07:35.380]  painful power outages again.
[02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:36.380]  And here's the best news.
[02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:42.140]  A remarkable fall truckload sale is going on right now that gets you $1,700 in bonuses
[02:07:42.140 --> 02:07:43.700]  when you buy a solar generator.

[02:07:51.620 --> 02:07:54.060]  That's falltruckloadsale.com.

[02:07:57.900 --> 02:08:09.900]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:09.900 --> 02:08:16.660]  Okay, we got one segment left here on this Tuesday's show with John McAvie, the tech
[02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:19.100]  pioneer, to murder suspect.
[02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:24.220]  Terra.com has a bunch of hard statements, claims they make about him, so he wants hard
[02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:25.220]  questions.
[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:26.220]  I'll throw them at him.
[02:08:26.220 --> 02:08:27.220]  You got it.
[02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:30.220]  I'm not saying a few of those, but I wanted to let him have his say first.
[02:08:30.220 --> 02:08:34.820]  But here are some of the questions we've got coming in at Real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[02:08:34.820 --> 02:08:40.220]  Is the antivirus business legit, or are the same companies creating viruses to push their
[02:08:40.220 --> 02:08:46.380]  products as we've always heard, or is that an urban legend, or is it a mix of both?
[02:08:46.380 --> 02:08:51.860]  I mean, I know our government created Stuxnet, launched it on Iran, and then said they wanted
[02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:56.220]  cybersecurity takeover in the name of fighting Stuxnet, which they admittedly created with
[02:08:56.220 --> 02:08:57.220]  Israel.
[02:08:57.220 --> 02:09:02.300]  So what's your breakdown on that, because you're the big granddaddy of antivirus, Mr.
[02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:03.300]  McAvie?
[02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:07.020]  Okay, I'd first like to say that I've had absolutely nothing to do with the antivirus
[02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:12.700]  business for 20 years, but the idea that antivirus companies would create viruses is
[02:09:12.700 --> 02:09:17.060]  utterly absurd, because there are hundreds of thousands of people out there doing it
[02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:18.300]  as we speak.
[02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:19.620]  Why would you waste money?
[02:09:19.620 --> 02:09:20.620]  Why would you waste the effort?
[02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:26.260]  You know, if I were running an antivirus company and I had the choice of hiring a programmer
[02:09:26.260 --> 02:09:31.380]  to fight the viruses, to make my product better, or hiring one to create a virus, only a madman
[02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:33.380]  would do the first.
[02:09:33.380 --> 02:09:36.700]  Because there's so many new viruses, what you want to do is create something to counter
[02:09:36.700 --> 02:09:40.260]  them, but also go out and hype how deadly the virus is.
[02:09:40.260 --> 02:09:41.260]  Absolutely.
[02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:45.340]  You might market how deadly they are, and maybe you might exaggerate that, I don't know,
[02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:47.340]  but even then there's no need.
[02:09:47.340 --> 02:09:51.140]  But certainly creating them would be counterproductive, and as such a company, I don't think would
[02:09:51.140 --> 02:09:52.540]  last long in this business.
[02:09:52.540 --> 02:09:57.340]  Yeah, it would be very, very reckless, I think it's more of a government purview, or against
[02:09:57.340 --> 02:09:58.340]  other governments.
[02:09:58.340 --> 02:09:59.340]  Great question.
[02:09:59.340 --> 02:10:00.580]  More questions coming up.
[02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:02.820]  Okay, you want tough questions?
[02:10:02.820 --> 02:10:03.820]  Here it is.
[02:10:03.820 --> 02:10:10.460]  McAvie retires to police, setting up a hamburger's key, I've stayed on a hamburger's key, a tiny
[02:10:10.460 --> 02:10:13.300]  island 36 miles off the coast.
[02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:16.300]  He builds a fence compound and staffs it with armed guards.
[02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:22.740]  Yeah, when I used to fly and it was a dirt runway, February 2010, Quorum EX, a new venture
[02:10:22.740 --> 02:10:28.540]  by McAvie, headquartered in Belize, launches its purpose to develop commercial antibiotics.
[02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:34.420]  In 2012, one of his properties is raided by Belize police force gang suppression unit
[02:10:34.420 --> 02:10:39.540]  as he is arrested, but not charged with suspicion of making crystal meth and possessing unlicensed
[02:10:39.540 --> 02:10:40.540]  firearms.
[02:10:40.540 --> 02:10:45.300]  In the raid, he is reportedly pulled out of bed with a 17-year-old girlfriend.
[02:10:45.300 --> 02:10:46.300]  Is that accurate?
[02:10:46.300 --> 02:10:48.300]  That is accurate, yes, sir.
[02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:53.260]  So, you probably would be, it wouldn't be in trouble if you were a congressman chasing
[02:10:53.260 --> 02:10:55.300]  a 14-year-old page, though, male page.
[02:10:55.300 --> 02:11:00.500]  Or even a female page at 14, the age of consent in Belize is 16.
[02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:03.740]  I did not say I was a perfect man.
[02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:05.540]  Everybody has their likes and dislikes.
[02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:11.020]  I like women, some men like bowling, golf, it's my choice.
[02:11:11.020 --> 02:11:17.140]  It's an unwise choice to be around the gang of a 17-year-old girl when I could be, especially
[02:11:17.140 --> 02:11:21.420]  in this country, her great-grandfather, but that does not make me a murderer.
[02:11:21.420 --> 02:11:23.700]  No, I don't think it does.
[02:11:23.700 --> 02:11:27.420]  Okay, continuing here with these points.
[02:11:27.420 --> 02:11:29.220]  Hey, you interrogate yourself.
[02:11:29.220 --> 02:11:30.220]  You want tough questions.
[02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:32.500]  Order some tough questions I should be asking.
[02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:33.500]  Good Lord.
[02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:34.500]  Are you the Easter Bunny?
[02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:39.300]  I was made of the fact that I was living with multiple women.
[02:11:39.300 --> 02:11:42.180]  Again, I would give you the same answer.
[02:11:42.180 --> 02:11:44.180]  We all have our likes and dislikes.
[02:11:44.180 --> 02:11:47.180]  I'm not sure that you got no Twitter responses, sir.
[02:11:47.180 --> 02:11:50.460]  No, no, I've got a ton of them coming in, but we just tweeted it during the break.
[02:11:50.460 --> 02:11:51.460]  Sorry.
[02:11:51.460 --> 02:11:55.700]  And my problem is I can't really walk and chew gum, so I could go to my tweet.
[02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:59.020]  They're actually bringing me a whole stack of questions here right now.
[02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:01.020]  Here, I'll ask you the questions.
[02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:07.180]  Ask him if he is concerned his guns will never be given back, and if he will be an excuse
[02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:09.140]  for the government needs to outlaw them.
[02:12:09.140 --> 02:12:12.180]  Well, I mean, they've already pretty much restricted them in beliefs, right?
[02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:13.660]  So there's a question about guns.
[02:12:13.660 --> 02:12:16.620]  Yeah, the question goes, all of my guns were licensed.
[02:12:16.620 --> 02:12:18.100]  Why did they have so many?
[02:12:18.100 --> 02:12:21.100]  I moved to the mainland, to the interior on the river.
[02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:26.500]  I was the only white man living in an entire district of 30,000 people, and I was apparently
[02:12:26.500 --> 02:12:27.500]  wealthy.
[02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:28.500]  I had cars.
[02:12:28.500 --> 02:12:29.500]  I had big houses.
[02:12:29.500 --> 02:12:31.420]  It's an extremely poor district.
[02:12:31.420 --> 02:12:36.540]  It was unwise for me to display my wealth, perhaps, but we had many, many robbery attempts,
[02:12:36.540 --> 02:12:40.780]  and it just occurred to me that there's no way to protect myself and my property without
[02:12:40.780 --> 02:12:45.220]  security against the guns, as to will they be given back for seven months?
[02:12:45.220 --> 02:12:50.580]  I've been attempting to get them back through lawyers, the embassy had tried once.
[02:12:50.580 --> 02:12:54.380]  The government refused to say, we have not concluded our investigation.
[02:12:54.380 --> 02:12:59.740]  Well, I mean, you can never have enough guns, so I mean, they're a great investment, and
[02:12:59.740 --> 02:13:01.540]  just it's like a dragon's horde.
[02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:05.940]  They say the more gold a dragon has, the more psychic they are, the more guns you have,
[02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:06.940]  the better you sleep at night.
[02:13:06.940 --> 02:13:11.940]  I mean, it's fun to like sleep on giant crates full of 50 calibers, don't you agree?
[02:13:11.940 --> 02:13:16.620]  Well, I'm not sure about that, sir, but I think under some circumstances, guns are
[02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:17.620]  in fact necessary.
[02:13:17.620 --> 02:13:23.220]  Yeah, well, I like, personally, this is a sleep better on just a huge mountain of crates
[02:13:23.220 --> 02:13:24.220]  of firearms ammunition.
[02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:28.460]  Well, I'm not sure I've never tried it, but perhaps you're right.
[02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:29.460]  No, I'm serious.
[02:13:29.460 --> 02:13:30.460]  It's something magic about it.
[02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:32.660]  Okay, I think it's a little sarcastic, not really.
[02:13:32.660 --> 02:13:33.660]  It's actually kind of ridiculous.
[02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:35.540]  I don't need to get near gun shops is the point.
[02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:39.340]  Yeah, I'm not really a big shopper unless I enter a gun shop and well, you ever seen
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:43.900]  Rodney Dangerfield in what's the movie Caddy Shackling goes, I'll take one of those, two
[02:13:43.900 --> 02:13:45.060]  of those and three of those.
[02:13:45.060 --> 02:13:48.540]  Oh, look at this hat looks like, oh, looks good on you.
[02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:51.540]  Okay, what is his take on Steve Jobs death?
[02:13:51.540 --> 02:13:52.540]  You want questions?
[02:13:52.540 --> 02:13:53.540]  There they are.
[02:13:53.540 --> 02:13:58.460]  Yeah, I'm not sure what the relevance is, but I thought that Steve Jobs was certainly
[02:13:58.460 --> 02:14:01.060]  one of the premier entrepreneurs of America.
[02:14:01.060 --> 02:14:06.620]  He was one of the few that had heart and sense and his passing was tragic.
[02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:09.780]  Okay, here's another one for those who are interested.
[02:14:09.780 --> 02:14:16.220]  I would recommend strongly his commencement address to Stanford, probably one of the finest
[02:14:16.220 --> 02:14:19.580]  commencement addresses I have ever heard and very moving.
[02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:21.460]  I actually quiet at the end.
[02:14:21.460 --> 02:14:22.460]  Wow.
[02:14:22.460 --> 02:14:23.460]  Interesting.
[02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:24.580]  Here's a serious question.
[02:14:24.580 --> 02:14:30.380]  Why don't you give yourself to the authorities for due process?
[02:14:30.380 --> 02:14:35.140]  Just a due process of pulling me in a cell, hanging me with my own belt and then telling
[02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:42.060]  the world that Mr. McAfee and Shane hung himself is not exactly what I would like to
[02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:43.060]  do this safe.
[02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:46.260]  Yeah, I had the Rockwell cops tell me they were going to kill me in a jail cell, but
[02:14:46.260 --> 02:14:49.060]  didn't stop talking about their drug dealings, I believe you.
[02:14:49.060 --> 02:14:52.740]  How do you feel about the outcome of the election here in the U.S.?
[02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:57.940]  Well, I had predicted it well in advance, but since I don't live there anymore, it
[02:14:57.940 --> 02:15:01.020]  doesn't affect me very much, but I have no problems with Mr. Obama.
[02:15:01.020 --> 02:15:05.740]  To be frank, sir, I try to divorce myself from political affiliations.
[02:15:05.740 --> 02:15:11.180]  I think that in the end, no matter which party wins, nothing changes.
[02:15:11.180 --> 02:15:14.780]  I got a bunch of other...
[02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:17.540]  Yeah, I'm just reading all these questions, trying to think of which one to read because
[02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:20.500]  a bunch of them are profane.
[02:15:20.500 --> 02:15:26.780]  It says, if you went camping when you woke up and your bleep was greasy, would you tell
[02:15:26.780 --> 02:15:31.540]  anyone, see, see, see, that's the problem, and there's a whole bunch more of these coming
[02:15:31.540 --> 02:15:32.540]  in.
[02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:33.540]  They're printing them off to bring them into me.
[02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:34.540]  Well, you know, when this interview ends...
[02:15:34.540 --> 02:15:38.860]  It sounds like the comments I get on my blog that I have to unfortunately filter through.
[02:15:38.860 --> 02:15:41.700]  Exactly, but let's expand on this.
[02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:45.500]  After you leave us in five minutes, you'll undoubtedly wish you would have said something.
[02:15:45.500 --> 02:15:46.940]  Let's say that now.
[02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:53.620]  What do you most importantly want to transmit to the Belizean authorities in their little
[02:15:53.620 --> 02:15:56.860]  greasy, tight-fitting police uniforms?
[02:15:56.860 --> 02:16:00.380]  I mean, I've seen the Belizean police, they look like something directly out of central
[02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:05.460]  casting of third world seedy people, but I'm not trying to be mean, but it is a fact.
[02:16:05.460 --> 02:16:06.940]  What would you like to say to them?
[02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:07.940]  I'm sure...
[02:16:07.940 --> 02:16:08.940]  But you know what?
[02:16:08.940 --> 02:16:10.940]  Maybe just because they're bad, I'm thinking you're good.
[02:16:10.940 --> 02:16:11.940]  I mean, how do we know?
[02:16:11.940 --> 02:16:14.940]  I wouldn't even say they're bad, sir.
[02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:18.300]  I think, by and large, the Belizean police are decent people.
[02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:24.980]  They get paid the equivalent of less than a dollar an hour, and they're expected to
[02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:26.980]  do work that puts their life in danger.
[02:16:26.980 --> 02:16:29.060]  It isn't the police itself.
[02:16:29.060 --> 02:16:32.020]  It's the bureaucracy that supports them and controls them.
[02:16:32.020 --> 02:16:39.140]  It's the higher-ups that use the police for their own interests, you know, to usher their
[02:16:39.140 --> 02:16:44.340]  drug deals and protect their own interests rather than protect the public.
[02:16:44.340 --> 02:16:46.540]  Oh, you don't think there's any narcotics?
[02:16:46.540 --> 02:16:49.540]  I don't think that I'm bashing the Belizean police as a people.
[02:16:49.540 --> 02:16:57.620]  I'm bashing the higher-ups in the government for their outrageous selfishness and greed.
[02:16:57.620 --> 02:16:59.420]  Are you related to Rob Zombie?
[02:16:59.420 --> 02:17:02.300]  Am I what?
[02:17:02.300 --> 02:17:03.860]  Rob Zombie, the rock and roll star.
[02:17:03.860 --> 02:17:05.540]  You look a lot like him, or he looks like you.
[02:17:05.540 --> 02:17:06.540]  You're not really...
[02:17:06.540 --> 02:17:09.980]  I don't think I'm related, but then, you know, much of my family background, I don't know
[02:17:09.980 --> 02:17:11.420]  about, so who knows?
[02:17:11.420 --> 02:17:13.020]  You're not really his father, are you?
[02:17:13.020 --> 02:17:14.540]  God, I hope not.
[02:17:14.540 --> 02:17:17.060]  I'm just joking, I'm going to stop right now, little...
[02:17:17.060 --> 02:17:19.980]  Well, listen, it's really interesting talking to you.
[02:17:19.980 --> 02:17:20.980]  What do you...
[02:17:20.980 --> 02:17:24.860]  Do you know about the New World Order, the global government, the NSA spying on people,
[02:17:24.860 --> 02:17:26.540]  the cancer viruses and the vaccines?
[02:17:26.540 --> 02:17:27.540]  Ever heard about that?
[02:17:27.540 --> 02:17:28.540]  Of course.
[02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:31.340]  Well, there is a New World Order.
[02:17:31.340 --> 02:17:36.060]  We all know that, but I think that I would point my finger first at the global press,
[02:17:36.060 --> 02:17:37.060]  not yourself, sir.
[02:17:37.060 --> 02:17:42.580]  I'm talking about the classical press that is interested in making money and making it
[02:17:42.580 --> 02:17:48.020]  as quickly as possible and making it through sensationalism and perversion of the facts.
[02:17:48.020 --> 02:17:52.940]  I think that we first get ideas from what we see on television and what we read in the
[02:17:52.940 --> 02:17:53.940]  press.
[02:17:53.940 --> 02:17:58.180]  Do you think that we could have convinced the world that there were weapons of mass
[02:17:58.180 --> 02:18:02.700]  destruction in Iraq if we had not first had the press convince us?
[02:18:02.700 --> 02:18:03.980]  No, that's right.
[02:18:03.980 --> 02:18:05.340]  They prepare the mind for it.
[02:18:05.340 --> 02:18:06.340]  Here's another question.
[02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:10.180]  Have you ever tried bath salts or any schedule one drugs?
[02:18:10.180 --> 02:18:13.180]  Absolutely not.
[02:18:13.180 --> 02:18:14.180]  Well...
[02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:17.420]  They didn't have those when I was doing drugs on 30 odd years ago.
[02:18:17.420 --> 02:18:20.380]  I'm sure I would have at the time, but no, I did not have the opportunity.
[02:18:20.380 --> 02:18:22.100]  Well, you don't look like you're doing drugs.
[02:18:22.100 --> 02:18:26.460]  You look like you're doing the Caribbean sun and, you know, living at the beach.
[02:18:26.460 --> 02:18:31.260]  But for the photos I've seen in the recent photos from Wired Magazine, you name it.
[02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:33.260]  You look like you found the fountain of youth, buddy.
[02:18:33.260 --> 02:18:34.260]  I thank you very much.
[02:18:34.260 --> 02:18:35.260]  I appreciate that.
[02:18:35.260 --> 02:18:37.780]  At my age, you have no idea how good that sounds.
[02:18:37.780 --> 02:18:39.780]  How old are you exactly?
[02:18:39.780 --> 02:18:40.780]  67.
[02:18:40.780 --> 02:18:43.700]  67 years old.
[02:18:43.700 --> 02:18:47.180]  And if you're doing methamphetamine, I'm a monkey's uncle.
[02:18:47.180 --> 02:18:48.180]  I appreciate that, sir.
[02:18:48.180 --> 02:18:50.180]  I would be a monkey's uncle, too.
[02:18:50.180 --> 02:18:52.220]  We only got a minute left.
[02:18:52.220 --> 02:18:53.460]  You've got our number.
[02:18:53.460 --> 02:18:54.460]  You've got our contact.
[02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:55.660]  You got my producer's number.
[02:18:55.660 --> 02:18:58.980]  If you're in the middle of something and they're coming after you, we can call you
[02:18:58.980 --> 02:19:04.500]  and we can record it right here so we can get it on the air at the latest, I mean, even
[02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:05.500]  late at night.
[02:19:05.500 --> 02:19:11.580]  As soon as possible, so you've got our contact info and you can also call my producer's phone.
[02:19:11.580 --> 02:19:15.580]  It's got a recording app on it so that we can catch anything and I'll talk to you during
[02:19:15.580 --> 02:19:16.580]  the break.
[02:19:16.580 --> 02:19:17.580]  Okay?
[02:19:17.580 --> 02:19:18.580]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:19:18.580 --> 02:19:19.580]  That's it.
[02:19:19.580 --> 02:19:22.980]  And believe me, sir, when I do see the police closing in, I will pick up my phone and I
[02:19:22.980 --> 02:19:25.340]  will call this number and I will start talking in.
[02:19:25.340 --> 02:19:28.860]  We'll not stop until they forcibly rest the phone from my fist.
[02:19:28.860 --> 02:19:32.500]  Well, we've also got some backup numbers that we'll actually automatically record.
[02:19:32.500 --> 02:19:36.740]  Guys, let's get him that number, get the IT guys, I forget the number.
[02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:39.940]  John, we'll give you that and again, I hope you're innocent, I hope you're telling the
[02:19:39.940 --> 02:19:40.940]  truth.
[02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:45.980]  I certainly got a side with an American against the Malaysian police when their story doesn't
[02:19:45.980 --> 02:19:51.180]  add up and there is a history of them persecuting you and having to release you so I don't know,
[02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:55.580]  I think you're telling the truth but I may be wrong, I'm not often wrong about things
[02:19:55.580 --> 02:19:56.580]  like this.
[02:19:56.580 --> 02:20:01.620]  John McAfee, they say he's the devil, I say he deserves to be heard, you just hurt him.
[02:20:01.620 --> 02:20:06.420]  You throw away leftovers, instead throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells,
[02:20:06.420 --> 02:20:09.140]  coffee grounds, pizza crusts and more into the bokashi.
[02:20:09.140 --> 02:20:12.540]  If you love to garden and compost but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin
[02:20:12.540 --> 02:20:14.460]  or this smell, then check out the E.M.
[02:20:14.460 --> 02:20:17.300]  bokashi food waste recycling system from Tereganics.
[02:20:17.300 --> 02:20:21.620]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop
[02:20:21.620 --> 02:20:22.620]  using fertilizers.
[02:20:22.620 --> 02:20:23.620]  The E.M.
[02:20:23.620 --> 02:20:25.660]  bokashi food waste recycling system.
[02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:29.740]  Rather than decomposition, the bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste so it
[02:20:29.740 --> 02:20:34.220]  takes less time to create nutrient dense humus for crops or gardens with no turning and no
[02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:35.220]  obnoxious odors.
[02:20:35.220 --> 02:20:40.060]  To learn more and order your bokashi online, visit Tereganics.com and click on the orange
[02:20:40.060 --> 02:20:41.060]  button.

[02:20:56.380 --> 02:20:58.380]  system from Tereganics.com.
[02:20:58.380 --> 02:21:00.380]  Tereganics, life's getting better.
[02:21:00.380 --> 02:21:06.220]  I don't mean to be nosy, but do you have the 37 food items you can't get in the coming
[02:21:06.220 --> 02:21:09.380]  disaster and may not survive without?
[02:21:09.380 --> 02:21:14.540]  As you already know, something big is about to hit the U.S. and you have got to be prepared.
[02:21:14.540 --> 02:21:18.940]  Did you know that your local grocery store only keeps a three-day supply of food on hand?
[02:21:18.940 --> 02:21:23.540]  So if there's any interruption in our fragile food supply chain or even a hint of a crisis,
[02:21:23.540 --> 02:21:28.140]  then the three-day supply at your local grocery store will be gobbled up by the mob in minutes
[02:21:28.140 --> 02:21:31.180]  and you and your family could be in serious trouble.
[02:21:31.180 --> 02:21:37.620]  That's why my friend just created a free video at 37items.com that reveals the 37 critical
[02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:41.140]  items you should hoard now before it's too late.
[02:21:41.140 --> 02:21:47.860]  Go watch the important video at 37items.com to discover the 37 things you can't buy after
[02:21:47.860 --> 02:21:50.860]  a disaster and may not survive without.
[02:21:50.860 --> 02:21:57.020]  I'm not sure how long the video will be online, so go to 37items.com before it's gone forever.
[02:21:57.020 --> 02:22:00.740]  Again, that's 37items.com.
[02:22:00.740 --> 02:22:04.540]  Being an armed citizen means having a gun with you all the time.
[02:22:04.540 --> 02:22:09.980]  Carrying a firearm every day requires a holster that is both concealable and comfortable.

[02:22:29.460 --> 02:22:31.460]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:31.460 --> 02:22:35.100]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[02:22:35.100 --> 02:22:36.100]  IRAs?
[02:22:36.100 --> 02:22:40.140]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[02:22:40.140 --> 02:22:41.820]  of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:45.300]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:45.300 --> 02:22:50.220]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:24:19.860 --> 02:24:23.260]  Well, the federal government, I'm going to cover this coming up in the next segment,
[02:24:23.260 --> 02:24:30.100]  says 22s are terrorists, got to turn those in, everything's a terrorist action, founding
[02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:35.100]  fathers are terrorists, freedoms terrorism, everything's terrorism, we should just believe
[02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:38.620]  the government no matter what they say, well not me.
[02:24:38.620 --> 02:24:42.620]  By the way, you hear that song, call me, we're going to open the phones up on any issue you
[02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:44.340]  wish to discuss here today.
[02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:48.100]  I'm a little bit better mood today, had a family medical emergency over the weekend
[02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:52.580]  that's got me in a very, very bad mood still to a certain extent, I'm not complaining or
[02:24:52.580 --> 02:24:56.620]  telling you my business for no reason, that's just why I've been a little bit irritable,
[02:24:56.620 --> 02:25:03.140]  little bit darker than normal on air but I am moving forward in a better mood right now.
[02:25:03.140 --> 02:25:14.500]  But the toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231-800-259-9231.
[02:25:14.500 --> 02:25:18.860]  And we just had John McAvion who said he's going to call us, he said he can't keep this
[02:25:18.860 --> 02:25:23.460]  up forever, I think he said that on air too, but off air he said he can't keep hiding out
[02:25:23.460 --> 02:25:24.460]  from him forever.
[02:25:24.460 --> 02:25:29.620]  In fact, I should have asked him about that, about any close calls he's had, I asked him
[02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:33.820]  about it off air, he said he has and I always think of the best questions after somebody's
[02:25:33.820 --> 02:25:40.020]  gone but there is that interview and that will certainly be a news maker right there
[02:25:40.020 --> 02:25:47.620]  which is not our only goal, just making the news on some petty issue really has no thrill.
[02:25:47.620 --> 02:25:52.380]  I've been thinking about this and I hope this infects you as well, that's why I'm telling
[02:25:52.380 --> 02:25:54.100]  you the story.
[02:25:54.100 --> 02:26:00.140]  I really like promoting freedom, I really like getting the word out about the Second Amendment,
[02:26:00.140 --> 02:26:04.860]  I like getting the word out about the Constitution, I like defending private property, I like
[02:26:04.860 --> 02:26:13.220]  defending the family and I like kicking corrupt, leech-like bureaucrats out of government.
[02:26:13.220 --> 02:26:20.780]  I mean that's why I do this, that's why I'm on the air and that's why I don't get a thrill
[02:26:20.780 --> 02:26:24.300]  going on some national television show to talk about some issue that doesn't matter,
[02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:26.540]  in fact I refuse to do it all the time.
[02:26:26.540 --> 02:26:31.700]  I've been invited on entertainment shows and stuff and said no because it has no thrill
[02:26:31.700 --> 02:26:37.900]  but it is thrilling to have PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and to be able to reach millions
[02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:42.140]  of people every day, it is thrilling to be up at the top of DrudgeReport.com right now
[02:26:42.140 --> 02:26:46.940]  which is the biggest news website in the world and can really set the agenda and the establishment
[02:26:46.940 --> 02:26:50.220]  is not like that, that is a big thrill.
[02:26:50.220 --> 02:26:57.220]  It is thrilling to be able to be on air and expose the TSA and catch them in a long train
[02:26:57.220 --> 02:26:59.300]  of lies.
[02:26:59.300 --> 02:27:02.620]  It is thrilling to engage these people.
[02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:05.740]  Now let me get a little bit of news now, let me come back from break, I'll go to your calls
[02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:07.820]  and then more news.
[02:27:07.820 --> 02:27:15.100]  Investigation, this is out of WSBTV, investigation shows TSA Patdown incident not first complaint
[02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:25.220]  against those very screeners pulling the Texas State Legislatures members, nieces dressed
[02:27:25.220 --> 02:27:31.820]  completely off of her, the 17-year-old and it turns out that that's happened to a lot
[02:27:31.820 --> 02:27:32.820]  of women.
[02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:39.540]  Yeah, they also have guys sometimes who could never get a woman but they settled a case
[02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:44.740]  two years ago in Texas, was it Amarillo or was a very reportedly bombshell woman, she
[02:27:44.740 --> 02:27:50.100]  was never on the news, they described her as a very attractive blonde with large bosoms
[02:27:50.100 --> 02:27:57.820]  or bosom and they pulled her shirt off and then began grabbing her breast and then she
[02:27:57.820 --> 02:28:02.700]  began crying and the three men stood around her and one of them asked her for a date and
[02:28:02.700 --> 02:28:10.860]  said sorry we have to do this by the way you're really good looking, can I have a date.
[02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:15.860]  And I think I can flay two cases in Texas but in one of them they had to settle the
[02:28:15.860 --> 02:28:20.740]  case and admitted to it and you were like but that doesn't sound normal, I mean when
[02:28:20.740 --> 02:28:25.500]  I was a single guy I would walk up to some woman and try to dominate them, I would go
[02:28:25.500 --> 02:28:30.580]  up and be charming to them and say by the way I just think you're a knockout, you want
[02:28:30.580 --> 02:28:36.700]  to go out and get dinner and we'll see a movie and so many times that was successful but
[02:28:36.700 --> 02:28:45.180]  I mean I cannot just imagine trying to force yourself on people but those of us that are
[02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:51.260]  normal we have to understand Janet Napolitano had to settle the cases with reportedly with
[02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:57.580]  her and her deputies sexually harassing men to the level and it wasn't about men, it was
[02:28:57.580 --> 02:29:03.220]  about dominating men and putting their stuff in the bathroom and telling them perform sex
[02:29:03.220 --> 02:29:07.620]  acts and you know what they settled those cases and you read those lawsuits and it's
[02:29:07.620 --> 02:29:14.780]  like I can't even say the stuff they reportedly did which they settled over but when you know
[02:29:14.780 --> 02:29:20.460]  how those type of people operate that's I mean look at them, have you seen the women
[02:29:20.460 --> 02:29:27.140]  that run the justice department? I mean obviously they're angry about life and they've never
[02:29:27.140 --> 02:29:31.900]  had a good sexual relationship and so they don't understand it's all about love, it's
[02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:37.460]  all about consent, they don't understand that's the fun part, is the co-consent part, they
[02:29:37.460 --> 02:29:42.740]  want to go dominate and that's what's going on, it's got a big stack of them abusing people,
[02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:49.620]  who do you think wants a job grabbing people all day perverts, sickos, rapists, scum, filth,
[02:29:49.620 --> 02:29:50.620]  trash?
[02:29:50.620 --> 02:30:01.180]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:32:11.740 --> 02:32:16.940]  drought in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.

[02:34:44.060 --> 02:34:51.660]  or you can call 888-25-33139 and you can give a subscription to your friends and family

[02:35:07.140 --> 02:35:11.780]  it and prisonplanet.tv has been around nine and a half years, well now more than nine
[02:35:11.780 --> 02:35:16.300]  and a half years, it'll be 10 years in April but the point is it's got 17 years of material
[02:35:16.300 --> 02:35:20.180]  on there, it's got a lot of my original stuff on there and before it had a few glitches
[02:35:20.180 --> 02:35:24.940]  and things over the years. Now it's first rate, I mean it is incredible bandwidth, incredible,
[02:35:24.940 --> 02:35:28.900]  it takes a minute to sign up and we need to get banners up explaining this. You get a
[02:35:28.900 --> 02:35:33.220]  membership for $5.95 a month, you can get a yearly and get it even less but sign up
[02:35:33.220 --> 02:35:40.500]  for a month, you get 10 memberships, that's $0.59 a month because we calculated it, that's
[02:35:40.500 --> 02:35:45.300]  right at if people actually use it, we'll lose money but I'm figuring some people will
[02:35:45.300 --> 02:35:49.460]  use it if you give out, you know, 10 username pass codes, you create a username and pass
[02:35:49.460 --> 02:35:53.180]  code, we're gonna put a thing up there explaining this to people that obviously isn't your other
[02:35:53.180 --> 02:35:58.780]  username and pass codes for other stuff, just create simple name and simple pass code and
[02:35:58.780 --> 02:36:03.020]  then send it as an e-gift, we're even gonna create little e-cards on there that you can
[02:36:03.020 --> 02:36:08.820]  also sample, click off the site and say here is your username pass code, this is a site
[02:36:08.820 --> 02:36:14.340]  with films and video of the Daily Radio show, The Nightly Show and you just put the username
[02:36:14.340 --> 02:36:24.260]  pass code in and bam, it's all there, films, books, I mean it's really massive now, prisonplanet.tv
[02:36:24.260 --> 02:36:28.300]  and the site is a huge success and it's financing so much of what we do but I'm thinking you
[02:36:28.300 --> 02:36:31.980]  know what, why not just make it 10 memberships, now that we can handle the bandwidth, now
[02:36:31.980 --> 02:36:37.940]  that we found cheaper sources of quality bandwidth, we got the stuff up there uploaded in HD now,
[02:36:37.940 --> 02:36:44.100]  I mean it's all there, prisonplanet.tv and it's our answer to the YouTube censorship
[02:36:44.100 --> 02:36:51.100]  and all the rest of it so prisonplanet.tv or infohorsenews.com that will also take you
[02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:55.140]  there, I think it scares your family to say here's your prisonplanet.tv membership, we're
[02:36:55.140 --> 02:37:03.060]  kind of segwaying towards calling it infohorsenews and so that's infohorsenews.com and you can
[02:37:03.060 --> 02:37:07.620]  send it to them and get folks to tune in and say hey, 7 o'clock tonight, watch this Nightly
[02:37:07.620 --> 02:37:13.860]  News show and it's world class guest and we just had the British Ron Paul on and we had
[02:37:13.860 --> 02:37:19.620]  Lord Montanon before that, Nigel Farage, we had John McAvie whose first interview I know
[02:37:19.620 --> 02:37:27.020]  of other than text interviews, boom, our show, his advisor told him come on here so hey, he's
[02:37:27.020 --> 02:37:30.620]  on the show and I checked his voice, checked the numbers, checked with some people, that's
[02:37:30.620 --> 02:37:37.620]  him, that's definitely the guy and it's just exciting, Joe Rogan will be on Thursday and
[02:37:37.620 --> 02:37:41.860]  you're just going to hear teleprompter free because even mainline radio, a lot of that
[02:37:41.860 --> 02:37:47.340]  is guys are following talking points, they repeat the same stuff over and over again
[02:37:47.340 --> 02:37:50.620]  that is not going to beat the globalist, I mean I'll just tell you right now, I would
[02:37:50.620 --> 02:37:54.900]  love other people to understand what I understand, it isn't that hard to understand, if you know
[02:37:54.900 --> 02:37:59.780]  history you get all this info, I'm going to go to your calls just lastly, two and three
[02:37:59.780 --> 02:38:04.980]  hours of plugging here just towards the end of this broadcast or the end of this hour,
[02:38:04.980 --> 02:38:10.740]  we did it for a couple weeks and they got very close to selling out because we're the
[02:38:10.740 --> 02:38:15.540]  biggest distributor appropriate, they got a huge giant, you know, completed shipment
[02:38:15.540 --> 02:38:22.260]  from their factories and it's done and they've got a large, oh yeah, Ventura's on tomorrow,
[02:38:22.260 --> 02:38:25.820]  they're reminding me, he pops in every Wednesday with us, I forgot to call him last Wednesday
[02:38:25.820 --> 02:38:30.340]  for the update on the nightly news, for the Wednesday premiere of the show, side issue,
[02:38:30.340 --> 02:38:36.340]  the point is, they were holding a sign up reminding me of that, thanks guys, what was
[02:38:36.340 --> 02:38:44.540]  I saying, I kind of get, I was talking about what, appropriate, yes thank you and the issue
[02:38:44.540 --> 02:38:52.820]  here is, Pro Pure is the best gravity fed filter out there, bar none and it blows away
[02:38:52.820 --> 02:38:57.460]  the competition, we have side by side comparisons at infowarstore.com or m4shop.com, we'll get
[02:38:57.460 --> 02:39:01.860]  you there and normally we sell it for the lowest price, we're the biggest distributor
[02:39:01.860 --> 02:39:13.140]  in the world, well, we're giving 15% off again because they've got a massive, massive group
[02:39:13.140 --> 02:39:17.860]  of these from their factory, they estimate at the numbers that they're selling right
[02:39:17.860 --> 02:39:21.900]  now that they can hold through the middle of December, well, I'm just saying until
[02:39:21.900 --> 02:39:26.500]  December 10th, if you order and you'll be guaranteed to get it before Christmas, it's
[02:39:26.500 --> 02:39:32.180]  a great gift to give as well, their travel one's only $185 and you get the 15% discount
[02:39:32.180 --> 02:39:36.100]  on that, I mean that blows away the competition and it's a much better filter, you can see
[02:39:36.100 --> 02:39:41.420]  the side by side comparisons, so Pro Pure water filters discounted like nowhere else,
[02:39:41.420 --> 02:39:52.140]  15% off, with promo code at checkout, water 15, just water and then 15 and you get 15%
[02:39:52.140 --> 02:39:58.380]  off, the already lowest prices out there on Pro Pure available at infowarstore.com or
[02:39:58.380 --> 02:40:05.020]  call 888-25-33139 and if you've got family, you got grandkids, whatever the case is, these
[02:40:05.020 --> 02:40:10.180]  are so easy, they cut almost everything out or reduce it down to non-detectable levels
[02:40:10.180 --> 02:40:14.220]  because you technically, even with an electron microscope, you still can't say, well, with
[02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:17.780]  the fluoride filters, this cuts everything out because fluoride's so small, some of
[02:40:17.780 --> 02:40:21.620]  it will probably still get through, even with the fluoride filters but it reduces it down
[02:40:21.620 --> 02:40:26.100]  to almost nothing, you can put swamp water in these and then drink them, the point is
[02:40:26.100 --> 02:40:31.580]  Pro Pure, it's what I use, it's what my family uses, it's what I've got on my RV, infowarstore.com
[02:40:31.580 --> 02:40:41.020]  or 888-25-33139, 888-25-33139, enough from me, John, in Wyoming, you're on the air.
[02:40:41.020 --> 02:40:47.220]  Yeah, Alex, I've got two quick things to bring out, I just got, oh, a couple of weeks ago,
[02:40:47.220 --> 02:40:54.260]  my latest copy of the 2012 annual report for the CFR and not only is General David Petraeus
[02:40:54.260 --> 02:40:59.100]  and General John R. Allen a member of the CFR, so is Paula D. Broadwell.
[02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:05.300]  No, no, no, wait a minute, wait a minute, Petraeus is a CFR fellow, he went to a college
[02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:09.620]  course they give and to Neil to Sauron, go ahead.
[02:41:09.620 --> 02:41:15.220]  Yeah, well they have all three of them listed as members of the CFR and another thing I've
[02:41:15.220 --> 02:41:20.060]  got, you like to have some interesting bumper music when you're going into and out of a
[02:41:20.060 --> 02:41:26.360]  broadcast, I've got two suggestions, one is from that wonderful 1979 Al Pacino movie
[02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:30.860]  and Justice for All at the very end when they're rolling the closing credits, there's
[02:41:30.860 --> 02:41:36.860]  a song called There's Something Funny Going On and listen to that song in its entirety,
[02:41:36.860 --> 02:41:37.860]  it is dynamite.
[02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:41.860]  You know, I agree, but I interrupted you, I interrupted you, go back to this lady you're
[02:41:41.860 --> 02:41:44.460]  talking about, there's a council on farm relations.
[02:41:44.460 --> 02:41:50.020]  Yeah, Paula D. Broadwell, she is one of the members, she was the one involved in that
[02:41:50.020 --> 02:41:55.660]  three-way operation you might say with Petraeus and with General Allen.
[02:41:55.660 --> 02:42:01.260]  Oh yeah, how obvious is it with those women, I mean, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:06.100]  Well, I mean the whole point is how did they meet, that's one thing that the mainstream
[02:42:06.100 --> 02:42:08.580]  media isn't talking about is how they met.
[02:42:08.580 --> 02:42:14.660]  Well, you've also got the twins visiting the wine house quite a bit, you know.
[02:42:14.660 --> 02:42:20.620]  And Chelsea Clinton who just signed on as a roving reporter earlier this year for NBC
[02:42:20.620 --> 02:42:26.100]  Nightly News has just signed on for a five-year membership with the CFR.
[02:42:26.100 --> 02:42:32.820]  So learn how to be a good, aging, globalist fossil, what a traitorous group openly against
[02:42:32.820 --> 02:42:33.820]  this country.
[02:42:33.820 --> 02:42:39.180]  Oh yeah, now anyway, go to Al Pacino's movie Injustice for All and get ahold of the theme
[02:42:39.180 --> 02:42:44.180]  song that they roll at the closing credits called There's Something Funny Going On and
[02:42:44.180 --> 02:42:50.420]  there's another good song from 1953, Comedian Red Buttons had a song called Strange Things
[02:42:50.420 --> 02:42:51.420]  Are Happening.
[02:42:51.420 --> 02:42:52.420]  Red Buttons, okay.
[02:42:52.420 --> 02:42:54.780]  Another one you want to listen to.
[02:42:54.780 --> 02:42:58.340]  Maybe we should go out with Red Buttons Strange Things Are Happening, I bet it's on YouTube
[02:42:58.340 --> 02:42:59.340]  guys.
[02:42:59.340 --> 02:43:00.340]  Thank you.
[02:43:00.340 --> 02:43:01.340]  If that's any good, we'll play that.
[02:43:01.340 --> 02:43:02.340]  Thank you so much, John.
[02:43:02.340 --> 02:43:05.220]  I'm sure it is good, you're a great Luskern, great Patriot and we always enjoy hearing
[02:43:05.220 --> 02:43:06.220]  from you.
[02:43:06.220 --> 02:43:09.260]  Recognize that guy's voice, he comes, calls in a few times a year.
[02:43:09.260 --> 02:43:13.260]  Adrian in the great state of Texas, go ahead, Adrian.
[02:43:13.260 --> 02:43:19.740]  Hi, I'm calling from El Paso, Texas, I'm here at the center of the drug war and Obama's
[02:43:19.740 --> 02:43:28.260]  Fast and Furious and I actually had a question, well, under the 2012 issue, I was like wondering
[02:43:28.260 --> 02:43:33.460]  what good does it do to prepare if we ignore the type of advanced sophisticated astronomy
[02:43:33.460 --> 02:43:35.540]  of the Mayans?
[02:43:35.540 --> 02:43:41.500]  Well, I do know the Mayans did have pretty advanced, I mean, for their time, they knew
[02:43:41.500 --> 02:43:44.940]  about stars that weren't even really visible, we believe with telescopes, we don't know
[02:43:44.940 --> 02:43:49.340]  how they did that, but then they also had some pretty backwards stuff with the human
[02:43:49.340 --> 02:43:53.860]  sacrifice and things going on, but the priest class always ends up degenerating down that
[02:43:53.860 --> 02:43:54.860]  road.
[02:43:54.860 --> 02:44:00.220]  But I don't think the world's going to end, I mean, I did a whole show on that, what was
[02:44:00.220 --> 02:44:04.580]  it yesterday or was it last, it was yesterday, I talked quite a bit about the fact that I
[02:44:04.580 --> 02:44:09.980]  think it's a hoax because even the Mayans didn't say the world was going to end December
[02:44:09.980 --> 02:44:10.980]  21st.
[02:44:10.980 --> 02:44:17.940]  Well, basically, you said it was the end of the fifth age and this is the end of the
[02:44:17.940 --> 02:44:24.420]  fifth age and what basically the theory is that every age it's ended in cataclysm and
[02:44:24.420 --> 02:44:30.260]  a pole shift is imminent and also why would the government start building huge underground
[02:44:30.260 --> 02:44:31.740]  bases in Denver?
[02:44:31.740 --> 02:44:36.820]  Well, because we know why, because it's all designed around a Russian or Chinese nuclear
[02:44:36.820 --> 02:44:40.980]  attack, because they're busy rolling weapons systems in and around Russia and China and
[02:44:40.980 --> 02:44:42.580]  trying to pick a nuclear war with them.
[02:44:42.580 --> 02:44:46.260]  Joel Scowleson breaks that down in the new film, Strategic Relocation.
[02:44:46.260 --> 02:44:52.980]  Right, well, in my opinion, real strategic relocation right now, I mean, 23 days away
[02:44:52.980 --> 02:44:59.340]  from the actual pole shift, if you believe in it, right now, I would relocate away from
[02:44:59.340 --> 02:45:00.340]  the coastal.
[02:45:00.340 --> 02:45:04.820]  I know there's people that say there's going to be water all the way up to the Rocky Mountains
[02:45:04.820 --> 02:45:10.220]  up to Denver and I just, you know what, I'm staying right here and I bet you money, I'm
[02:45:10.220 --> 02:45:14.580]  going to be on air December 21st, December 22nd, normally I would take off that entire
[02:45:14.580 --> 02:45:16.780]  week because I've promised my wife.
[02:45:16.780 --> 02:45:21.140]  There's always some reason I end up working in and around holidays, but my children are
[02:45:21.140 --> 02:45:23.660]  growing up and I'm hardly knowing them some of the time.
[02:45:23.660 --> 02:45:29.580]  But I'm going to end up doing the 21st, 22nd, probably even 23rd, because I'm going to predict
[02:45:29.580 --> 02:45:35.620]  now when the world doesn't end December 21st, people are going to say the calculations you
[02:45:35.620 --> 02:45:41.220]  heard it here first are that the Gregorian calendar was off three days.
[02:45:41.220 --> 02:45:42.220]  It's now the 24th.
[02:45:42.220 --> 02:45:44.220]  We're all dead on the 24th.
[02:45:44.220 --> 02:45:45.580]  Right by the hills.
[02:45:45.580 --> 02:45:47.980]  And then when that doesn't happen, it'll be, it was awful week.
[02:45:47.980 --> 02:45:51.060]  And so there'll be months of imminent destruction.
[02:45:51.060 --> 02:45:54.860]  Meanwhile, they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[02:45:54.860 --> 02:45:59.540]  Meanwhile, they're killing us and diabetes is up 3000%.
[02:45:59.540 --> 02:46:05.300]  Cancer almost 3000%, pediatric cancer, 10,000%, breast cancer, leading the world, total police
[02:46:05.300 --> 02:46:09.420]  state, new world order takeover, but it's always just something over the hill.
[02:46:09.420 --> 02:46:12.700]  And look, look, Adrienne, I'm not saying you're bad to think maybe this is coming.
[02:46:12.700 --> 02:46:13.700]  Maybe it is.
[02:46:13.700 --> 02:46:14.700]  We're all dead.
[02:46:14.700 --> 02:46:18.980]  So what are you going to do in your last 23 days before pole shift and, you know, mountains
[02:46:18.980 --> 02:46:24.500]  being thrust up 10,000 feet and liquid magma spewing out and cabler elves running around
[02:46:24.500 --> 02:46:29.980]  vampirically drinking blood, dogs and cats living together, possums flapping with pink
[02:46:29.980 --> 02:46:30.980]  wings.
[02:46:30.980 --> 02:46:31.980]  What are you going to do?
[02:46:31.980 --> 02:46:37.820]  Well, the actual prediction is that the nine gods with lower case G would return, including
[02:46:37.820 --> 02:46:42.820]  the cuckoo con and well, there's a lot of things we don't know about.
[02:46:42.820 --> 02:46:44.300]  There's their history.
[02:46:44.300 --> 02:46:45.300]  That scares them.
[02:46:45.300 --> 02:46:47.540]  Actually, they're, they're Mayan calendar there.
[02:46:47.540 --> 02:46:54.700]  The way they used to, the, the, my, the Mayan year was actually more accuracy than the atomic
[02:46:54.700 --> 02:46:55.700]  clock.
[02:46:55.700 --> 02:46:56.700]  I understand that.
[02:46:56.700 --> 02:46:58.700]  So let me just ask you this question.
[02:46:58.700 --> 02:47:04.100]  So, so, so if it's not the 21st, are you going to call me back on the 22nd?
[02:47:04.100 --> 02:47:05.100]  I am.
[02:47:05.100 --> 02:47:08.340]  Actually, I wanted to know if you're going to do an end of the world show and go down
[02:47:08.340 --> 02:47:12.780]  with the ship with us, you know, you know, like Woody Harrelson at the end of, uh,
[02:47:12.780 --> 02:47:17.300]  2012 and everything's, everybody's dying and he's like reporting as the fireballs come
[02:47:17.300 --> 02:47:18.300]  towards him.
[02:47:18.300 --> 02:47:19.300]  All right.
[02:47:19.300 --> 02:47:20.700]  I appreciate you joining us, sir.
[02:47:20.700 --> 02:47:21.700]  Thank you.
[02:47:21.700 --> 02:47:27.460]  I just, you know, what there could be an end to world if the unexpected data from large
[02:47:27.460 --> 02:47:32.020]  Hadron colliders suggests the collision may be producing a new type of matter and they
[02:47:32.020 --> 02:47:35.100]  go on in physics.com.
[02:47:35.100 --> 02:47:38.500]  It's admitted that a lot of physicists say it could destroy the earth with strangelets
[02:47:38.500 --> 02:47:39.940]  and other things it can create.
[02:47:39.940 --> 02:47:44.460]  If you don't know what a strangelet is, have you seen the newest Star Trek?
[02:47:44.460 --> 02:47:46.700]  I'm not really a Star Trek fan because it's so ridiculous.
[02:47:46.700 --> 02:47:49.700]  I mean, I like the old Star Trek because it's so funny.
[02:47:49.700 --> 02:47:51.900]  I actually kind of like Captain Kirk.
[02:47:51.900 --> 02:47:52.900]  Let's, let's be honest.
[02:47:52.900 --> 02:47:56.300]  I kind of worship Captain Kirk a little bit sometimes and it's not right because it's
[02:47:56.300 --> 02:47:59.900]  so cheesy, but the kind of newer stuff takes itself too seriously.
[02:47:59.900 --> 02:48:03.860]  So it's just cheesiness that takes itself serious, not funny cheesiness that doesn't
[02:48:03.860 --> 02:48:09.660]  take itself serious, very funny, especially when Captain Kirk, uh, aka William Shatner,
[02:48:09.660 --> 02:48:14.980]  you know, covers it, uh, but, uh, the new one is very accurate where they have that
[02:48:14.980 --> 02:48:19.620]  antimatter strangelet and they put it in the center of Vulcan and it sucks in.
[02:48:19.620 --> 02:48:24.140]  That's actually what it would look like if, if they create one of these particles, it
[02:48:24.140 --> 02:48:29.100]  will fall to the center of the earth and depending on the type of particle size or what it does,
[02:48:29.100 --> 02:48:34.820]  it may take a minute, may take a week, it'll start doubling in size and pulling matter
[02:48:34.820 --> 02:48:35.820]  into it.
[02:48:35.820 --> 02:48:37.620]  A black hole will form.
[02:48:37.620 --> 02:48:41.580]  And then by the time we notice the earthquake, we'll be gone like that.
[02:48:41.580 --> 02:48:46.100]  And then the globalist will, you know, won't get to act trendy anymore and go to events
[02:48:46.100 --> 02:48:50.260]  and give each other awards and, uh, act, uh, act powerful.
[02:48:50.260 --> 02:48:52.140]  So that, that wouldn't be very much fun.
[02:48:52.140 --> 02:48:58.340]  What it, uh, let's, uh, who's up next here, Tim in Washington, you're on the air.
[02:48:58.340 --> 02:48:59.340]  Go ahead.
[02:48:59.340 --> 02:49:01.460]  How's it going, Alex?
[02:49:01.460 --> 02:49:02.460]  Pretty good.
[02:49:02.460 --> 02:49:06.420]  So I've been wargaming in my mind to figure out what would happen if shit stuff really
[02:49:06.420 --> 02:49:07.820]  did hit the fan.
[02:49:07.820 --> 02:49:11.980]  And I was kind of curious, is there a sheriff or is there a president in America where local
[02:49:11.980 --> 02:49:17.060]  citizens, everyday citizens without training could be deputized to fight back, say a human
[02:49:17.060 --> 02:49:18.060]  invasion?
[02:49:18.060 --> 02:49:19.060]  Yeah.
[02:49:19.060 --> 02:49:21.420]  It's called civil defense, which is based under the militia and we had to delay it cause
[02:49:21.420 --> 02:49:22.620]  you used some profanity there.
[02:49:22.620 --> 02:49:27.580]  We didn't edit that guy, but we had to cut out a few seconds cause what he said, um,
[02:49:27.580 --> 02:49:29.220]  and yeah, there's basically your answer.
[02:49:29.220 --> 02:49:33.380]  I mean, just educate the whole, the people on the subject of liberty and tyranny will
[02:49:33.380 --> 02:49:35.940]  vanish like phantoms at dawn, Thomas Jefferson.
[02:49:35.940 --> 02:49:36.940]  Krillin, Wisconsin.
[02:49:36.940 --> 02:49:37.940]  You're on the air.
[02:49:37.940 --> 02:49:38.940]  Go ahead.
[02:49:38.940 --> 02:49:39.940]  Hey, Alex.
[02:49:39.940 --> 02:49:40.940]  Hey, buddy.
[02:49:40.940 --> 02:49:43.940]  I'm sure you can interview with John McAfee.
[02:49:43.940 --> 02:49:45.940]  What'd you think of that?
[02:49:45.940 --> 02:49:46.940]  Yeah.
[02:49:46.940 --> 02:49:53.460]  If he's still a US citizen, um, has he, for this latest, uh, alleged murder, why hasn't
[02:49:53.460 --> 02:49:57.980]  he gone to the US consulate or asked the US government for, uh, intervention?
[02:49:57.980 --> 02:49:59.460]  I don't know if he can get there.
[02:49:59.460 --> 02:50:03.940]  Uh, he's pretty much hiding out in the woods, running around from house to house.
[02:50:03.940 --> 02:50:07.140]  But, um, I don't know the details of it, but, but that's what he's basically described
[02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:08.140]  on his blog.
[02:50:08.140 --> 02:50:10.180]  But, but I should have asked him that question.
[02:50:10.180 --> 02:50:11.180]  That's a good question.
[02:50:11.180 --> 02:50:12.180]  Yes.
[02:50:12.180 --> 02:50:13.180]  Absolutely.
[02:50:13.180 --> 02:50:14.180]  And that's all I had.
[02:50:14.180 --> 02:50:17.140]  I mean, he probably doesn't trust the US consulate.
[02:50:17.140 --> 02:50:18.140]  You know what I mean?
[02:50:18.140 --> 02:50:22.780]  Well, yeah, the government down there is corrupt, but we have a corrupt one up here.
[02:50:22.780 --> 02:50:23.980]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:50:23.980 --> 02:50:24.980]  What do you think about him?
[02:50:24.980 --> 02:50:29.220]  I mean, he's obviously eccentric, but I mean, do you think he, uh, think he did it?
[02:50:29.220 --> 02:50:33.260]  No, he's totally, he's totally telling the truth.
[02:50:33.260 --> 02:50:34.700]  I, I believe that.
[02:50:34.700 --> 02:50:39.340]  And later on, I'm going to run, um, that audio of that interview on our their voice
[02:50:39.340 --> 02:50:43.900]  analysis technology and I'm going to, I'm going to prove that he's telling the truth.
[02:50:43.900 --> 02:50:44.900]  Very interesting.
[02:50:44.900 --> 02:50:45.900]  All right.
[02:50:45.900 --> 02:50:47.140]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:47.140 --> 02:50:54.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, we take you out with, uh, red buttons if I was an Easter Bunny.
[02:50:54.140 --> 02:51:01.900]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.900 --> 02:51:06.820]  Alex Jones here with a message that could revolutionize health in this country.
[02:51:06.820 --> 02:51:10.460]  Going back about a year and a half ago, I began to learn about the incredible health
[02:51:10.460 --> 02:51:13.140]  effects of young Jebedee products.
[02:51:13.140 --> 02:51:15.500]  Aaron Dykes lost 92 pounds.
[02:51:15.500 --> 02:51:18.900]  We're going to show you some before and afters.
[02:51:18.900 --> 02:51:20.860]  Aaron, break down what happened.
[02:51:20.860 --> 02:51:21.860]  Your story.
[02:51:21.860 --> 02:51:26.060]  I've worked really hard with diet and exercise to try to lose weight, but I just didn't get
[02:51:26.060 --> 02:51:27.060]  the results.
[02:51:27.060 --> 02:51:28.060]  It just didn't happen.
[02:51:28.060 --> 02:51:30.860]  Then I saw what you were doing with info wars team.com.
[02:51:30.860 --> 02:51:34.740]  I wasn't even trying to lose weight, but I got it because I wanted to feel better energy.
[02:51:34.740 --> 02:51:35.740]  I wanted that nutrition.
[02:51:35.740 --> 02:51:40.100]  Didn't even understand how that could kickstart my own weight loss goals, but the products
[02:51:40.100 --> 02:51:41.460]  did that for me.
[02:51:41.460 --> 02:51:46.340]  I found myself suddenly losing weight, more energetic, wanting to exercise, wanting to
[02:51:46.340 --> 02:51:49.620]  eat the right foods and they don't even advertise it as weight loss.
[02:51:49.620 --> 02:51:55.220]  I want to challenge our radio listeners to go to info wars team.com, sign up as a distributor
[02:51:55.220 --> 02:52:01.780]  and get wholesale pricing discounts at info wars team.com.

[02:52:08.980 --> 02:52:14.700]  CWR environmental has been supplying emergency water filters worldwide for over 25 years.
[02:52:14.700 --> 02:52:15.700]  The difference?

[02:52:59.620 --> 02:53:03.900]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best selling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[02:53:03.900 --> 02:53:04.900]  Box.
[02:53:04.900 --> 02:53:07.860]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:07.860 --> 02:53:12.660]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[02:53:12.660 --> 02:53:16.980]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world class healer.
[02:53:16.980 --> 02:53:22.540]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:53:22.540 --> 02:53:27.620]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[02:53:27.620 --> 02:53:32.740]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[02:53:32.740 --> 02:53:33.900]  normal cell.
[02:53:33.900 --> 02:53:37.580]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[02:53:37.580 --> 02:53:41.660]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:53:41.660 --> 02:53:52.380]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from Carnivora.com, that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com, that's 1-866-836-8735,
[02:53:52.380 --> 02:53:56.980]  1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[02:53:56.980 --> 02:54:26.820]  Get your immune system, it's the only one you've got.
[02:54:26.820 --> 02:54:48.580]  It's the only one you've got, it's the only one you've got, it's the only one you've
[02:54:48.580 --> 02:54:49.580]  got.
[02:54:49.580 --> 02:55:07.460]  It's the only one you've got, it's the only one you've got, it's the only one you've
[02:55:07.460 --> 02:55:30.220]  got, it's the only one you've got, it's the only one you've got, it's the only one you've
[02:55:30.220 --> 02:55:52.420]  got, it's the only one you've got, it's the only one you've got, it's the only one you
[02:55:52.420 --> 02:55:56.180]  could bring down the power grid with him. Mr. Wellings did not provide any explanation
[02:55:56.180 --> 02:55:59.580]  of why over the last decade the terrorist group has not targeted the power grid of the
[02:55:59.580 --> 02:56:04.900]  United States, maybe because it's totally manufactured and too busy taking down governments
[02:56:04.900 --> 02:56:13.380]  for the globalist. But he has now created the anti-gun scare with the Bloomberg breakfast,
[02:56:13.380 --> 02:56:19.420]  the calling for needed solutions to be introduced, which goes on the link calling for restrictions
[02:56:19.420 --> 02:56:22.700]  of the Second Amendment. That's kind of a pure news article Kurt wrote. He might want
[02:56:22.700 --> 02:56:27.300]  to, Kurt's in there ad, he's right through the hall, right through that door. He might
[02:56:27.300 --> 02:56:31.460]  want to add something that the solutions are going after those evil, evil guns, because
[02:56:31.460 --> 02:56:35.420]  that's what they say there. Yeah, so you know the terrorists, they're everywhere, we've
[02:56:35.420 --> 02:56:44.380]  got to do something right now. Now I mentioned this earlier, I don't think that passing through
[02:56:44.380 --> 02:56:49.180]  the galactic plane, whether that's true or not, or you know any of this stuff, or the
[02:56:49.180 --> 02:56:55.260]  winged serpent that they had to sacrifice, you know little kids to, or you know the sun
[02:56:55.260 --> 02:57:01.180]  wouldn't come back. I just really don't put much stock in what the Mayans say. And I've
[02:57:01.180 --> 02:57:05.500]  been attacked a lot for not taking the world's gonna end December, December 21st, but I will
[02:57:05.500 --> 02:57:10.660]  be here live on that Friday and I will be live that Sunday, because still we'll be hearing
[02:57:10.660 --> 02:57:14.940]  of course that it's still the end of the world and I just haven't recognized it yet. So we
[02:57:14.940 --> 02:57:22.460]  will be covering that at Nausium, but if you go to infowars.com we can punch up my screen,
[02:57:22.460 --> 02:57:28.300]  I'll show people this. Experts to study whether robots will exterminate humanity, and in the
[02:57:28.300 --> 02:57:36.280]  big university study that is taking place at Cambridge, they're mainly looking at extinction
[02:57:36.280 --> 02:57:42.300]  events from rise of the machines, because machines, AI are being designed or they're
[02:57:42.300 --> 02:57:48.900]  building towards it from a military perspective. And so the concern here is that there'll be
[02:57:48.900 --> 02:57:53.220]  a military in nature and decide to just get rid of humanity. You know what, I don't see
[02:57:53.220 --> 02:57:58.540]  that as the greatest threat. I see globalist technocrats in control of automated ground
[02:57:58.540 --> 02:58:07.100]  sea and air drone robots will be able to attack humanity and run false flags and say people
[02:58:07.100 --> 02:58:13.020]  hack the machines or run attacks themselves and it won't be a military refusing gun confiscation
[02:58:13.020 --> 02:58:18.540]  because the robots won't say no. And again if you go to this article that's up at infowars.com,
[02:58:18.540 --> 02:58:23.700]  I was at the big threat is Hadron superconducting supercollider because they admit that it is
[02:58:23.700 --> 02:58:28.620]  a possibility it could cause things a lot bigger than large hydrogen explosions. And
[02:58:28.620 --> 02:58:32.180]  the government's admission of developing anti-matter weapons which remain classified but they
[02:58:32.180 --> 02:58:37.340]  admit they've developed and also bio weapons and things like that. I think that's some
[02:58:37.340 --> 02:58:41.060]  of the biggest threats we face. See you on the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock Central,
