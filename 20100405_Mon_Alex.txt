[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:30.000]  there's too many people in northern Mexico and southern California that's
[00:30.000 --> 00:40.720]  what caused the earthquake or at least that's what that particular congressman
[00:40.720 --> 00:47.240]  Hank Johnson from Georgia must believe he thinks islands are floating and are
[00:47.240 --> 00:50.600]  buoyant like a beach ball and that if too many people get on the edge of an
[00:50.600 --> 00:54.740]  island it'll make it tumble over into the ocean like a sailboat that's the
[00:54.740 --> 00:59.520]  type of mindset we're dealing with with the dumb down general public and even
[00:59.520 --> 01:05.720]  some members of Congress who will allow Al Gore and others to tell them fables
[01:05.720 --> 01:10.900]  fairy tales children's stories to scare them into submission it's a very
[01:10.900 --> 01:18.280]  childlike public that we have in many sectors of our society and it's up to
[01:18.280 --> 01:23.280]  us the adults to reach out to these people and to educate them we don't
[01:23.280 --> 01:32.920]  have time to screw around anymore it is Monday the fifth day of April 2010 we're
[01:32.920 --> 01:37.560]  gonna be live here for the next four hours congressman Ron Paul will be
[01:37.560 --> 01:46.920]  joining us coming up in the next hour via cell phone on the road so I would
[01:46.920 --> 01:51.360]  remind my producers now get that cell phone number when he does call us like
[01:51.360 --> 01:57.120]  last time was it sure to cut out also Catherine Austin Fitz will be joining us
[01:57.120 --> 02:03.360]  talk about what's happening in the economy and what the parasite elite the
[02:03.360 --> 02:08.720]  ruling class are setting up so that's always extremely informative with
[02:08.720 --> 02:15.440]  Catherine Austin Fitz who worked at the highest levels of the federal
[02:15.440 --> 02:22.520]  government we are going to have open phones also in the first second third
[02:22.520 --> 02:31.720]  and fourth hour today on any issue you wish to discuss we've seen the UN and
[02:31.720 --> 02:37.400]  Danny Glover say that the earthquakes in Haiti and the earthquake in Chile were
[02:37.400 --> 02:42.760]  caused by carbon dioxide that plants breathe as part of our atmosphere I'm
[02:42.760 --> 02:47.320]  looking for them to say that the earthquake in Southern California the
[02:47.320 --> 02:51.280]  seven point two magnitude earthquake at least 20 million people felt the quake
[02:51.280 --> 03:01.600]  according to seismologists and I've also seen other newscast in previous
[03:01.600 --> 03:07.320]  earthquakes in Southern California being blamed on global warming I mean this is
[03:07.320 --> 03:14.360]  just the height of conscious lying and deception I won't be surprised that they
[03:14.360 --> 03:18.600]  don't start telling people that science is settled and that islands do float on
[03:18.600 --> 03:24.920]  top of the water and are going to capsize so we'll be breaking that down
[03:24.920 --> 03:30.280]  today also want to play a audio clip the video is up on prisonplanet.com an
[03:30.280 --> 03:34.120]  article by Steve Watson Illinois congressman I don't worry about the
[03:34.120 --> 03:38.400]  Constitution they brought up the fact that the health bills unconstitutional
[03:38.400 --> 03:43.440]  to him and he didn't deny that he said I don't care and I don't worry about the
[03:43.440 --> 03:52.560]  Constitution I guess like George Bush said it's just a GD piece of paper what
[03:52.560 --> 03:56.800]  one could eat no fat and one could eat no lean and so between the two they lick
[03:56.800 --> 04:05.440]  the platter clean a nursery rhyme Republicans hate one side of the bill
[04:05.440 --> 04:09.080]  of rights and Constitution and shred it as fast as they can the Democrats hate
[04:09.080 --> 04:15.160]  the other side of it and between the two they lick the platter clean let's even
[04:15.160 --> 04:18.400]  worse than that the Republicans always rail against democratic policies so they
[04:18.400 --> 04:21.880]  get power then they keep it the Democrats always rail against what the
[04:21.880 --> 04:33.120]  Republicans put into place and then they keep it for themselves as well okay I'm
[04:33.120 --> 04:40.280]  gonna run down the news on the other side of this quick break and Greenpeace

[08:16.560 --> 08:41.400]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[08:41.400 --> 08:48.760]  ladies and gentlemen we are live it is Monday the fifth day of April 2010
[08:48.760 --> 08:53.840]  until the bottom of the hour we have Congressman Ron Paul with us and we
[08:53.840 --> 08:58.960]  appreciate him coming on Congressman good to have you here there is so much
[08:58.960 --> 09:02.840]  going on I've got a lot of important questions I want to ask you but out of
[09:02.840 --> 09:06.880]  the gates what is most important on your plate that you want to warn the
[09:06.880 --> 09:12.800]  American people about today oh there are too many things I don't know which
[09:12.800 --> 09:18.040]  one's the worst you know the finances there they're so bad and they're getting
[09:18.040 --> 09:21.040]  much worse you know the way they're spending their money running up the
[09:21.040 --> 09:25.520]  debt I think that the financial crisis is getting so much closer interest rates
[09:25.520 --> 09:31.280]  are going up I think that's a major major problem we face it what I was
[09:31.280 --> 09:37.040]  seeing about it I don't think he believes that he's achieved great things you know by
[09:37.040 --> 09:42.800]  flooding the market they mean a country of democracy oppression taking care of
[09:42.800 --> 09:47.320]  his friends and the people who lost their jobs don't have a voice so he thinks
[09:47.320 --> 09:52.200]  he's had a great victory but the second thing is what's going on over the
[09:52.200 --> 09:57.200]  Middle East that's getting much worse the the Iraqi situations worse rumors now
[09:57.200 --> 10:01.160]  that they won't remove any troops at all and of course we're going to be up to a
[10:01.160 --> 10:08.160]  hundred thousand troops in Afghanistan and Karzai Karzai is now you know
[10:08.160 --> 10:13.840]  feeling very bold and critically United States so I when that happens you know I
[10:13.840 --> 10:18.200]  just wonder what we're how we'll handle that because you know at times when when
[10:18.200 --> 10:23.360]  our good friends start to act on their own we usually get rid of them or you
[10:23.360 --> 10:27.320]  know desert them or go on their own you know so I think that thing is a whole
[10:27.320 --> 10:31.560]  mess and can really blow up in our face well let's get into the economy then
[10:31.560 --> 10:37.840]  first I've seen the different job charts showing that this is the worst
[10:37.840 --> 10:46.040]  recession since the late 1940s and meanwhile I have a business week article
[10:46.040 --> 10:49.800]  from two weeks ago where the federal regulators are pressuring public and
[10:49.800 --> 10:56.720]  private pension funds to be invested quote in failed banks we have Geithner
[10:56.720 --> 11:02.880]  in the news with China talking about not buying as many dollars we have open
[11:02.880 --> 11:08.640]  discussion by Moody's and other top rating services of the US losing their
[11:08.640 --> 11:20.080]  triple a rating the economic situation appears to be spiraling downwards I don't
[11:20.080 --> 11:25.320]  think there's any doubt about that but there's still a lot of people with their
[11:25.320 --> 11:29.120]  head in the sand and I don't know whether they're lying to themselves but
[11:29.120 --> 11:32.760]  oh I really believe that things have turned around they look at the other
[11:32.760 --> 11:38.320]  side of the story and they say you know more jobs are being found and that you
[11:38.320 --> 11:46.440]  know staying under 10% and there's GDP is going up and they either try to pull
[11:46.440 --> 11:50.440]  the people or they've pulled themselves but ultimately though the market rules
[11:50.440 --> 11:55.840]  the market will dictate and everybody will catch on but I think where the
[11:55.840 --> 12:01.840]  disconnect is is that the government is putting a positive spin on it but you
[12:01.840 --> 12:05.480]  know the people that you talk to and the people in the tea party movement they
[12:05.480 --> 12:09.520]  know better you know that's why there's the dog on upset and I they're not buying
[12:09.520 --> 12:14.320]  into this this is a completely different year than we've had it I guess many many
[12:14.320 --> 12:21.840]  years well the AP reported last week that half of the so-called new jobs are
[12:21.840 --> 12:27.720]  government jobs and census jobs and we know that the unemployment numbers
[12:27.720 --> 12:32.080]  really above 20% so even with cooked numbers they're claiming that we've
[12:32.080 --> 12:37.480]  gotten a small amount of job increases yeah and in this last report there was a
[12:37.480 --> 12:42.760]  lot of part-time jobs they weren't real jobs if there was part-time jobs the
[12:42.760 --> 12:49.960]  government job and it's I don't I don't think it's that much good news in that
[12:49.960 --> 12:56.200]  report at all congressman Ron Paul let's talk about the health care bill how it
[12:56.200 --> 13:00.880]  was passed what it really does the best ways you think the states I can
[13:00.880 --> 13:04.800]  counter this I think we shouldn't just have lawsuits and entrust the federal
[13:04.800 --> 13:12.640]  courts a state level nullification specifically on the health care bill you
[13:12.640 --> 13:16.960]  talked about Obama being in bold and now he wants his carbon tax to try to pass
[13:16.960 --> 13:24.840]  that in the Senate declaring co2 a toxic waste let's talk about health care
[13:24.840 --> 13:29.720]  legislation because we've seen Obama say look it's been a few weeks since this
[13:29.720 --> 13:34.240]  past the birds are singing the sun is shining but he knows that this thing
[13:34.240 --> 13:39.520]  doesn't get phased in but until a next year and the three years after that so
[13:39.520 --> 13:46.000]  that's a very deceptive game he's playing of perception and you know what
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.880]  he'll probably do is by that time whoever's in charge of he's there or
[13:49.880 --> 13:55.240]  whoever they'll say oh maybe we didn't do quite enough maybe maybe what we
[13:55.240 --> 14:00.160]  really needed that single-payer system so what failure to them is just another
[14:00.160 --> 14:06.160]  opportunity and if it's been the next year or next six months the people only
[14:06.160 --> 14:10.280]  hear good news and they don't see what it's going to really cost you know he
[14:10.280 --> 14:16.240]  may get away with it for a year without it coming down hard on them but
[14:16.240 --> 14:21.640]  ultimately though it's a it's a it's an illusion to think that they can do what
[14:21.640 --> 14:27.120]  they claim and not cost any money and improve health care that that's a hard
[14:27.120 --> 14:33.600]  film well you're a medical doctor yourself not just a congressman and of
[14:33.600 --> 14:38.240]  course you're also someone who's researched how the economy really works
[14:38.240 --> 14:41.880]  specifically for people that have questions about the health care
[14:41.880 --> 14:47.680]  legislation it's now law a what is in it that concerns you most b what do you
[14:47.680 --> 14:53.160]  think the most effective constitutional strategy is to defeat this
[14:53.160 --> 14:59.200]  well the process that if the people were awake enough and there were enough of
[14:59.200 --> 15:02.120]  us it would be just to change the Congress change the president repeal all
[15:02.120 --> 15:07.280]  that stuff I mean that has the smoothest way to do it the part that
[15:07.280 --> 15:11.600]  bothers me the most of course the process that you talked about I mean how
[15:11.600 --> 15:15.120]  they pulled it off and you know we passed the rule and the rule passed the
[15:15.120 --> 15:19.720]  Senate version and then they go to reconciliation that was horrible but I
[15:19.720 --> 15:25.600]  think philosophically the worst part was that they moved away from any opening
[15:25.600 --> 15:29.440]  for a private option you know they talk about public option but what about a
[15:29.440 --> 15:33.120]  private option why don't why don't individuals have the right to get out
[15:33.120 --> 15:37.880]  fortunately some people you know opt out of the public school system and they
[15:37.880 --> 15:43.200]  have private schooling and homeschooling and why don't we have that in medicine
[15:43.200 --> 15:48.280]  let's let them off now and that's the HSA approach but they minimize those it's
[15:48.280 --> 15:53.200]  much more difficult and if and if you opt out just say I don't want it I'll take
[15:53.200 --> 15:58.040]  care of myself I'll handle everything I don't want to be a board of the state you
[15:58.040 --> 16:04.840]  have to pay a fine you know pay your $9,000 and that that to me was a big big
[16:04.840 --> 16:10.920]  move in the wrong direction and I if you instead of thinking the day after like
[16:10.920 --> 16:14.880]  it is passed oh let's repeal the whole thing well you know that'd be great if
[16:14.880 --> 16:19.320]  you could but maybe if we would narrow it down and I want to introduce
[16:19.320 --> 16:25.800]  legislation to this just narrow it down to legalize a private option to get out
[16:25.800 --> 16:32.640]  take care of yourself and that might be less confusing than going through 2,000
[16:32.640 --> 16:37.680]  pages and explaining you know what is good what is bad what we're gonna keep
[16:37.680 --> 16:42.840]  can you really get rid of everything you know that whole thing so but I would
[16:42.840 --> 16:47.760]  like to see the day where we just have a changeover in Congress and we wouldn't
[16:47.760 --> 16:51.360]  be have to fighting these things over and over I mean they pass this stuff and
[16:51.360 --> 16:57.760]  then the people now are becoming more informed and they get upset but there's
[16:57.760 --> 17:06.240]  a lot of frustration out there turning into anger how do you what do you see is
[17:06.240 --> 17:09.840]  the best strategy to defeat this though at the state level I mean can't the
[17:09.840 --> 17:15.000]  states nullify this because it does force the states to pay for a large
[17:15.000 --> 17:21.200]  part of the federal mandate and so we have attorney generals now suing but I
[17:21.200 --> 17:26.480]  don't think that's enough I don't I don't I'm all for that if people want to do
[17:26.480 --> 17:30.880]  it but they're behind the eight ball there it is not going to be a problem
[17:30.880 --> 17:35.280]  it's not alike you know they take our highway fun and then they come and say
[17:35.280 --> 17:38.480]  well you get your highway fun from the federal government we're gonna spend
[17:38.480 --> 17:42.400]  that your speed limit you everybody has to try 55 miles an hour you know that's
[17:42.400 --> 17:47.320]  what they did for 20 years and they say no we're not gonna do that we're gonna
[17:47.320 --> 17:51.480]  fight it we don't want that for a while all right we just keep your highway fun
[17:51.480 --> 17:55.880]  and that's what they'll do on Medicare you know I mean yeah what are you gonna
[17:55.880 --> 18:01.160]  do repeal every state participation in Medicaid and this system and then they
[18:01.160 --> 18:04.920]  then they they'll make the problems worse they're unfunded and they they're
[18:04.920 --> 18:10.520]  gonna have more unfunded mandates if they just you know try to ignore the law
[18:10.520 --> 18:16.840]  so I think it if states want to do it and I think it's good that they're
[18:16.840 --> 18:21.360]  talking about it and they pass these resolutions that represents you know some
[18:21.360 --> 18:26.600]  good PR on how upset the people are but I don't think that is the solution the
[18:26.600 --> 18:31.680]  ultimate solution for all this is people having a better understanding and a
[18:31.680 --> 18:35.520]  better trust in the way the market works and the way freedom works and you
[18:35.520 --> 18:39.520]  don't need the government in any state taking care of us from cradle to grave
[18:39.520 --> 18:44.920]  if that isn't repealed that that attitude that I think you're around on the
[18:44.920 --> 18:51.640]  edges of people like the station won't do the trick congressman you've talked
[18:51.640 --> 18:55.840]  about the fact that what's really gonna in this is the country collapsing
[18:55.840 --> 19:01.800]  financially can you speak to that and then also as a medical doctor my dad's
[19:01.800 --> 19:07.480]  a physician and everyone knows that federal money comes in for abortion and
[19:07.480 --> 19:12.160]  then and then these hospitals and clinics just use money that they would
[19:12.160 --> 19:15.760]  have used for something else for the abortion and use the other federal
[19:15.760 --> 19:20.800]  money to pay for the other program so it's a shell game yeah and that whole
[19:20.800 --> 19:25.000]  thing in that process which was very annoying when that they couldn't agree
[19:25.000 --> 19:30.160]  on the abortion language so Obama it was easy for you all right you guys
[19:30.160 --> 19:33.640]  won't write a law I'll write a law I'll write my own law right off them up to
[19:33.640 --> 19:38.880]  executive order and I will state the height of that now they argue back and
[19:38.880 --> 19:44.360]  forth some of the conservatives dead oh well that won't count that isn't the
[19:44.360 --> 19:48.560]  executive order isn't the law of the land I don't think that was the right
[19:48.560 --> 19:53.400]  argument because it is the law of the land the reason it isn't effective is
[19:53.400 --> 19:58.440]  what you hear that is that the high amendment I don't think ever did that
[19:58.440 --> 20:04.440]  much you have to strike all the funds to all these pregnancy centers that are
[20:04.440 --> 20:08.120]  doing abortion and they say well the high amendment says you can't use any
[20:08.120 --> 20:13.880]  funds for abortion oh yeah but you can use them for birth control pills so they
[20:13.880 --> 20:17.880]  get shifted the money is all fungible and when the money gets shifted over they
[20:17.880 --> 20:24.080]  go ahead and do the abortion so that was that was all a con game but it
[20:24.080 --> 20:29.760]  emphasized the the process on how that whole thing was being passed but this
[20:29.760 --> 20:38.840]  bill in addition to what I said earlier has put a lot more obstacles between the
[20:38.840 --> 20:44.160]  doctor and the patient we've always in recent years we've had insurance
[20:44.160 --> 20:48.920]  companies and HMO companies and drug companies but now we're going to have a
[20:48.920 --> 20:54.480]  lot of bureaucrats make any decisions about how to practice health care and
[20:54.480 --> 20:59.120]  that that of course it'll cost a lot more money but the money is going to go
[20:59.120 --> 21:04.520]  to paying bureaucrats and paying extra people to push papers around so this is
[21:04.520 --> 21:09.360]  it's gonna be costly the care is going to go down and it's just a lot more
[21:09.360 --> 21:13.960]  people and they admit that with this a comparative care that now the bureaucrats
[21:13.960 --> 21:17.800]  will decide and they're actually in the news today saying look you won't get an
[21:17.800 --> 21:26.440]  e-surgery you'll get a cortisone or steroid shot and oh well you'll get
[21:26.440 --> 21:34.400]  Prozac will just basically drug you and so they cut Medicare and Medicaid they
[21:34.400 --> 21:39.360]  raise taxes and then they restrict benefits this is exactly what Europe
[21:39.360 --> 21:45.280]  has done and you know Dennis Kucinich before he flip-flopped and others said
[21:45.280 --> 21:48.600]  this was nothing but a boondoggle for the insurance companies and I've looked
[21:48.600 --> 21:54.880]  at the lobbying numbers 90 plus percent of the big health care HMO insurance
[21:54.880 --> 21:59.480]  companies drug companies 90 plus percent of the lobbying money went for this bill
[21:59.480 --> 22:06.760]  so isn't that a name isn't this a red herring when they say oh the right
[22:06.760 --> 22:10.880]  wingers just don't want poor people to get care I mean really all this is is
[22:10.880 --> 22:15.360]  government coming in team teamed up with corporations to basically lower the
[22:15.360 --> 22:21.960]  standard of care but make more money I I think that's absolutely right we we
[22:21.960 --> 22:26.160]  don't have the classical socialized medicine but we're not on the verge of
[22:26.160 --> 22:30.040]  having that I don't even think Obama was pushing it he was pushing for
[22:30.040 --> 22:35.440]  corporate medicine you know he was not to destroy the insurance company they
[22:35.440 --> 22:38.560]  might have complained that they have to get their best deal but they're pretty
[22:38.560 --> 22:42.320]  happy right now you know they have a lot more customers that bill will be paid
[22:42.320 --> 22:47.640]  and and they'll do quite fine but we have we have the corporations get
[22:47.640 --> 22:51.440]  involved and you know we talked a lot about the military industrial complex
[22:51.440 --> 22:55.960]  there's a military I mean a medical industrial complex to you know the the
[22:55.960 --> 23:00.960]  all the all the big corporations in government and they do spend a lot of
[23:00.960 --> 23:07.440]  money you know on lobbying so there's some big bucks paid and if we've
[23:07.440 --> 23:11.280]  conditioned somehow or another our country has been conditioned to believe
[23:11.280 --> 23:15.600]  that medicine is different you deliver medicine and the world does it better
[23:15.600 --> 23:20.440]  that government has to do with everybody has a wife medical care so
[23:20.440 --> 23:22.800]  therefore the government has to give you this right
[23:22.800 --> 23:24.080]  take care of it
[23:24.080 --> 23:25.880]  and we're not even close
[23:25.880 --> 23:28.720]  uh... to change in that attitude
[23:28.720 --> 23:29.520]  matter of fact
[23:29.520 --> 23:33.200]  when i say that on tv it sort of shocks people
[23:33.200 --> 23:34.080]  what
[23:34.080 --> 23:35.080]  you're saying
[23:35.080 --> 23:37.400]  people i don't have a white medical care
[23:37.400 --> 23:39.360]  but now you have a right to your life
[23:39.360 --> 23:40.880]  ever write your liberty
[23:40.880 --> 23:41.800]  you have a right to your
[23:41.800 --> 23:45.000]  through to your labor you can take care of your medical care will come to me
[23:45.000 --> 23:48.280]  you know you've been a medical doctor for forty years i mean you know better
[23:48.280 --> 23:49.440]  than anybody
[23:49.440 --> 23:53.640]  uh... that government involvement in health care in the last forty years
[23:53.640 --> 23:56.880]  is what's added all these layers of costs and allowed big
[23:56.880 --> 24:00.520]  uh... corporate medical care to institutionalize things and get into
[24:00.520 --> 24:01.960]  people's bank accounts
[24:01.960 --> 24:04.800]  and so now it's only going to get worse
[24:04.800 --> 24:08.240]  that's right and uh... the
[24:08.240 --> 24:12.480]  companies uh... will make a lot of money on it and the patient
[24:12.480 --> 24:14.040]  ultimately will become
[24:14.040 --> 24:15.600]  very unhappy
[24:15.600 --> 24:16.680]  and uh...
[24:16.680 --> 24:20.560]  of course the doctors are more unhappy than ever before
[24:20.560 --> 24:23.460]  and who knows what'll happen there of course there were threats that a lot of
[24:23.460 --> 24:25.320]  doctors would quit i'm not
[24:25.320 --> 24:29.080]  sure that's going to happen because they don't have a whole lot of option
[24:29.080 --> 24:31.520]  they've been trained long time to
[24:31.520 --> 24:33.860]  to practice medicine i mean
[24:33.860 --> 24:36.040]  they're going to have to find something else
[24:36.040 --> 24:37.440]  uh... they'll probably
[24:37.440 --> 24:39.520]  uh... moan and groan
[24:39.520 --> 24:43.360]  put up with one more layer of government
[24:43.360 --> 24:46.400]  shifting gears into some other subjects i don't know if you've seen this video
[24:46.400 --> 24:47.720]  yet the representative
[24:47.720 --> 24:49.280]  hank johnson
[24:49.280 --> 24:52.780]  said he didn't want us to be able to move more troops to go on because he was
[24:52.780 --> 24:54.920]  afraid that the floating island
[24:54.920 --> 24:59.700]  would capsize and and he was serious representative uh... phil hair
[24:59.700 --> 25:03.840]  of illinois is on video last friday saying he quote doesn't worry about the
[25:03.840 --> 25:05.080]  constitution
[25:05.080 --> 25:07.600]  because you know health care is a right
[25:07.600 --> 25:11.720]  uh... and and and so i mean as you said many times it's not just some evil force
[25:11.720 --> 25:14.600]  in washington we know the globalist play into that
[25:14.600 --> 25:17.680]  we've also got a lot of other congressmen and government people
[25:17.680 --> 25:22.480]  that really are uh... unfortunately is dumb as a box of rocks can you comment
[25:22.480 --> 25:25.680]  to people thinking that islands float and and that the constitution isn't
[25:25.680 --> 25:28.640]  important
[25:28.640 --> 25:29.440]  i can't
[25:29.440 --> 25:31.560]  i can't hear it but you think
[25:31.560 --> 25:34.000]  he sounded like he would carry it
[25:34.000 --> 25:35.840]  yes
[25:35.840 --> 25:38.080]  as pretty as pretty bizarre
[25:38.080 --> 25:39.340]  but uh...
[25:39.340 --> 25:40.040]  i think
[25:40.040 --> 25:43.520]  even there once was not going to a republican president
[25:43.520 --> 25:44.800]  that something
[25:44.800 --> 25:46.800]  uh... rather careless about
[25:46.800 --> 25:50.600]  conviction that we're supposed to follow the constitution
[25:50.600 --> 25:52.840]  i guess what it made it up to talk to
[25:52.840 --> 25:54.560]  if they actually say it
[25:54.560 --> 25:58.800]  we know they either totally ignorant don't understand the constitution
[25:58.800 --> 26:02.680]  or they don't have any respect they don't care about following
[26:02.680 --> 26:03.600]  them
[26:03.600 --> 26:04.880]  to say that
[26:04.880 --> 26:09.320]  all we don't have to do that we don't want to do that we don't need to do that
[26:09.320 --> 26:11.080]  i think it's still shocking
[26:11.080 --> 26:11.920]  for somebody
[26:11.920 --> 26:14.080]  to act like that
[26:14.080 --> 26:15.920]  it is uh...
[26:15.920 --> 26:19.440]  we've only got about three four minutes left with congressman ron paul today
[26:19.440 --> 26:23.080]  i wanted to bring up your son in kentucky uh... ran paul
[26:23.080 --> 26:26.440]  in many polls ten points ahead the democrat and republican
[26:26.440 --> 26:29.280]  challengers showing that this anti-incumbency
[26:29.280 --> 26:32.000]  and this hunger for constitutionalist type candidate
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.080]  runs across party lines in the
[26:34.080 --> 26:37.920]  the republican party has in politico and other publications said
[26:37.920 --> 26:39.240]  they are gunning
[26:39.240 --> 26:43.120]  uh... for your son who is a true conservative and and libertarian
[26:43.120 --> 26:45.240]  and of course as you know two weeks ago
[26:45.240 --> 26:48.400]  the federal uh... the estate election commission there
[26:48.400 --> 26:51.080]  ruled that trade gracing
[26:51.080 --> 26:53.360]  can run the election commission
[26:53.360 --> 26:56.360]  uh... and can oversee his own election
[26:56.360 --> 26:59.480]  uh... no other state that i've seen is ever allowed this type of conflict of
[26:59.480 --> 27:00.200]  interest
[27:00.200 --> 27:03.160]  uh... can you speak to that is a new level of corruption
[27:03.160 --> 27:04.880]  and and uh... any concern
[27:04.880 --> 27:08.080]  uh... that you have uh... for the election coming up in kentucky
[27:08.080 --> 27:11.800]  well i i'm very concerned about it i'm shocked that they allowed that to
[27:11.800 --> 27:14.000]  happen but you think politically
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.320]  uh... they uh... grand campaign to get the mileage out of that and get
[27:18.320 --> 27:19.760]  get the people on their side but
[27:19.760 --> 27:23.040]  that might not change the outcome of election a close election doesn't take
[27:23.040 --> 27:25.040]  a whole lot of work and effort
[27:25.040 --> 27:26.960]  uh... to change things
[27:26.960 --> 27:28.080]  though uh...
[27:28.080 --> 27:29.440]  i i think it
[27:29.440 --> 27:32.920]  i've heard to make sure they have the poll waters and differently over at the
[27:32.920 --> 27:33.680]  everything
[27:33.680 --> 27:35.880]  people
[27:35.880 --> 27:36.800]  who
[27:36.800 --> 27:37.720]  uh... to
[27:37.720 --> 27:39.960]  you know to try to protect themselves
[27:39.960 --> 27:40.720]  but you know it
[27:40.720 --> 27:41.880]  to me that uh...
[27:41.880 --> 27:46.000]  but we we will we probably all have these perfect elections united states you
[27:46.000 --> 27:47.680]  know we go across overseas
[27:47.680 --> 27:49.800]  start war is to teach them how to run
[27:49.800 --> 27:52.200]  but on this election though
[27:52.200 --> 27:53.400]  i guess uh...
[27:53.400 --> 27:55.920]  i guess we better have faith in our system
[27:55.920 --> 27:59.560]  well i mean there's no doubt that he is the chief election official running the
[27:59.560 --> 28:00.560]  election
[28:00.560 --> 28:04.240]  and the kentucky executive branch ethics commission said that was fine
[28:04.240 --> 28:05.760]  i mean this is a felony
[28:05.760 --> 28:09.080]  and uh... in uh... most days people have to recuse themselves
[28:09.080 --> 28:12.280]  i mean on its face he's got all these employees that know
[28:12.280 --> 28:15.840]  that they're gonna end up being in a senatorial office so even if he doesn't
[28:15.840 --> 28:16.760]  want to cheat
[28:16.760 --> 28:19.360]  i mean there's no doubt you're gonna end up having
[28:19.360 --> 28:22.520]  uh... county officials and others that have been promised jobs
[28:22.520 --> 28:25.520]  uh... they're gonna uh... steal votes if it looks like their candidates can
[28:25.520 --> 28:26.320]  lose and
[28:26.320 --> 28:28.080]  your son's ten points ahead
[28:28.080 --> 28:30.120]  and so if he doesn't win ladies and gentlemen
[28:30.120 --> 28:32.960]  something is rotten in the state of denmark
[28:32.960 --> 28:35.800]  i want to hear it
[28:35.800 --> 28:39.920]  you think if they were honest about what was going on they wouldn't want to be
[28:39.920 --> 28:41.280]  close to it
[28:41.280 --> 28:42.720]  you know uh... because
[28:42.720 --> 28:45.880]  if they figure they're gonna win and uh... they pulled off and wouldn't let
[28:45.880 --> 28:48.120]  you know you know what you're gonna believe it anyway
[28:48.120 --> 28:50.120]  he would uh... you would think they would be
[28:50.120 --> 28:53.520]  uh... you know the great people would be the one that would want to be
[28:53.520 --> 28:55.000]  uh... away from it
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.280]  though that they would not
[28:57.280 --> 29:00.720]  amazing folks can find out more at the campaign for liberty
[29:00.720 --> 29:04.720]  dot com congressman ron paul's our guests the last forty five seconds
[29:04.720 --> 29:07.720]  uh... the democrats are really start to talk about censoring the internet
[29:07.720 --> 29:09.800]  censoring talk radio
[29:09.800 --> 29:13.280]  if they'll violate the constitution on all these other fronts why not there
[29:13.280 --> 29:16.280]  are you concerned about restrictions on free speech cyber security
[29:16.280 --> 29:19.800]  oh yeah i think uh... you know i think the other day when we had a
[29:19.800 --> 29:22.520]  cyber security vote
[29:22.520 --> 29:24.360]  that was everybody else but uh...
[29:24.360 --> 29:28.440]  anything touching the internet or communication if i will not
[29:28.440 --> 29:32.000]  uh... vote for and they're always wanting to do that though i think that
[29:32.000 --> 29:33.400]  i think some of the
[29:33.400 --> 29:36.240]  talk i've heard about this but we need more government
[29:36.240 --> 29:40.560]  uh... management of the media to get a better balance uh...
[29:40.560 --> 29:41.840]  pretty scary stuff
[29:41.840 --> 29:43.080]  though uh...
[29:43.080 --> 29:44.680]  that i don't know what
[29:44.680 --> 29:47.440]  congressman we're going to break i know you've got to go but i have to tell you

[34:28.680 --> 34:33.240]  wrong but that just happens when you're dealing with people's
[34:33.240 --> 34:36.840]  schedulers and we've got schedulers and there's time zones and there's traveling
[34:36.840 --> 34:40.200]  going on but jessie ventura on a host of issues

[35:11.400 --> 35:14.200]  good because there's a lot of important things we need to go over
[35:14.200 --> 35:19.000]  dr paul craig roberts is on with us on wednesday he said goodbye
[35:19.000 --> 35:23.480]  truth has fallen and taken liberty with it but he's doing a few radio and tv
[35:23.480 --> 35:28.280]  interviews before he says cyanara and retires from the
[35:28.280 --> 35:31.880]  fight against the new world order at least for now
[35:31.880 --> 35:36.120]  you know when i talked to him a week and a half ago when he first put out this
[35:36.120 --> 35:40.360]  basic re resignation from the fight you know he just said at least for the time
[35:40.360 --> 35:44.760]  being he he's done with a big column twice a week
[35:44.760 --> 35:50.440]  and uh hey he's been fighting the stuff for many years and
[35:50.440 --> 35:54.120]  it's not up to any of us to do it all ourselves it's just
[35:54.120 --> 35:58.280]  up to each and every one of us do what we can and to try to inform and wake up
[35:58.280 --> 36:08.920]  and warn as many people as we possibly can okay i want to get into
[36:08.920 --> 36:12.760]  the environmental movement who they really are
[36:12.760 --> 36:16.600]  and what their in game is and the the fact that
[36:16.600 --> 36:21.480]  in cooked polls upwards of 55 percent of people believe they're a group of
[36:21.480 --> 36:26.680]  criminal fraudsters who just want to tax and control our lives
[36:26.680 --> 36:30.680]  every environmental show every wildlife show
[36:30.680 --> 36:38.040]  on cable tv every textbook everything i've ever seen the last 30 years
[36:38.040 --> 36:42.920]  every textbook i had in public school
[36:42.920 --> 36:46.840]  every show about whales or dolphins or giraffes or
[36:46.840 --> 36:51.080]  monkeys or apes or dinosaurs it just doesn't matter
[36:51.080 --> 36:57.080]  is all a brainwashing event to teach humans that we're bad we're evil and
[36:57.080 --> 36:59.160]  the government's going to restrict your lifestyle
[36:59.160 --> 37:03.960]  for your own good not to enslave you but for your own good
[37:03.960 --> 37:08.760]  and so if you look at polls from say five years ago
[37:08.760 --> 37:13.160]  60 plus percent bought into the propaganda because it was culturally and
[37:13.160 --> 37:15.880]  morally the thing to do if you were a caring person
[37:15.880 --> 37:21.320]  we've seen a flip-flop of that number now the majority and that's in mainstream
[37:21.320 --> 37:25.720]  usa today CNN cooked polls where they go to their
[37:25.720 --> 37:29.240]  constituents people demographics that they know
[37:29.240 --> 37:34.920]  we're going to give them a pro environmentalist takeover slant
[37:36.200 --> 37:42.760]  they go to them and 55 upwards of 60 depending on the poll
[37:42.760 --> 37:47.960]  show that uh some other focus groups and studies i've seen the last few months
[37:47.960 --> 37:51.240]  since climate gate broke back in november last year
[37:51.240 --> 37:55.640]  show that upwards of 80 plus percent know it's a fraud
[37:55.640 --> 38:00.040]  and when you get big environmental congressman like hank johnson
[38:00.040 --> 38:03.560]  in a global warming rant talking about islands capsizing
[38:03.560 --> 38:07.800]  tumping over and even does the hand gesture he says the island will
[38:07.800 --> 38:13.160]  flip over there's too many people on it uh it's going to go to 90 percent very
[38:13.160 --> 38:15.880]  quickly because this is really a peer pressure
[38:15.880 --> 38:19.560]  type thing and as as people learn it's okay to come out and talk about global
[38:19.560 --> 38:23.160]  warming being a fraud the whole thing falls apart it's like gondy said first
[38:23.160 --> 38:27.320]  they ignore you then they laugh at you then they
[38:27.320 --> 38:31.240]  attack you then you win and we've now entered the attack
[38:31.240 --> 38:35.560]  phase and so we've seen green peace we've
[38:35.560 --> 38:39.080]  seen the founder of the gaia movement we've seen the un
[38:39.080 --> 38:43.080]  we've seen them all say okay it doesn't matter if you don't want a green
[38:43.080 --> 38:48.040]  global government a green world order that's what the un called it
[38:48.040 --> 38:51.160]  in fact guys i forgot to print it for this piece i'm about to do
[38:51.160 --> 38:55.000]  i was a watson article about a month ago it was actually in the un document the
[38:55.000 --> 39:00.600]  headline is un calls for green world order that's their quote
[39:00.600 --> 39:05.080]  and it is just to say it's hellish what is a word
[39:05.080 --> 39:10.520]  a word is only a word hellish authoritarian control is real and is
[39:10.520 --> 39:14.360]  indescribable until you've been through it
[39:14.360 --> 39:17.720]  and just my investigations into corruption and oppression
[39:17.720 --> 39:23.000]  have scarred me fundamentally and i've grown up in a great country in a great
[39:23.000 --> 39:26.920]  state with great parents and uh i did see government
[39:26.920 --> 39:31.400]  drug dealing in high school i did see corruption
[39:32.920 --> 39:36.920]  i was attacked by by illegal aliens i mean i have experienced
[39:36.920 --> 39:39.480]  the fruits of the new world order but i've also experienced all the good
[39:39.480 --> 39:43.320]  things in our world that the government likes to take credit for no
[39:43.320 --> 39:48.600]  the world is a great place despite what they're doing and obama knows this is
[39:48.600 --> 39:50.600]  why he says oh the birds are still tweeting the
[39:50.600 --> 39:55.240]  you know it's still a beautiful day there's flowers there's trees
[39:55.240 --> 39:58.920]  there's the sky how many times have i made that point
[39:58.920 --> 40:02.440]  over the years they know it's a beautiful wonderful world it's a blessing to
[40:02.440 --> 40:05.080]  be in it they know there's all this good in the world
[40:05.080 --> 40:07.800]  and they always take credit for all the good and then they know you don't
[40:07.800 --> 40:11.560]  recognize the evil because it's masquerading is good
[40:11.560 --> 40:16.120]  and they know that there's this whole backdrop but
[40:17.400 --> 40:21.080]  yeah here's the headline leaked un documents real plan for green world
[40:21.080 --> 40:25.880]  order by 2012 so they're now shifting gears and they've
[40:25.880 --> 40:32.280]  announced what this shift means and so i want to break this down
[40:32.280 --> 40:35.960]  in detail because greenpeace is now saying we know where you live we're
[40:35.960 --> 40:39.320]  coming after you we're gonna get violent and all these big environmental
[40:39.320 --> 40:43.800]  groups have always had auxiliary secret
[40:45.240 --> 40:49.160]  yeah it's like shin fein in ireland then has a secret violent arm
[40:49.160 --> 40:52.760]  but now they're coming out in the open with their malice brigades that work
[40:52.760 --> 40:55.240]  for the banks
[40:56.200 --> 41:00.200]  so we're gonna break all this down today and tie it into
[41:00.200 --> 41:03.880]  the media demonizing gun owners conservatives setting up the poor
[41:03.880 --> 41:08.120]  hitari militia clearly a hundred percent innocent now and set up
[41:08.120 --> 41:11.400]  but i wanted to dovetail that first segue
[41:11.400 --> 41:15.560]  uh with the corbett report he does a great job now this video is up on info
[41:15.560 --> 41:19.240]  wars dot com and prison planet dot com but i i broke down to ten minute
[41:19.240 --> 41:23.000]  interview what the cashless society is and then that
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.520]  ties into the environmental takeover so let's go ahead and play
[41:26.520 --> 41:30.040]  part of this ten minute piece and then i will uh go to break and come back and
[41:30.040 --> 41:33.480]  get into the fact that we're intellectually and
[41:33.480 --> 41:37.160]  politically beating the bloodthirsty greens
[41:37.160 --> 41:41.000]  who are a bunch of murderous control freaks on record
[41:41.000 --> 41:45.320]  they've done psychological studies of them uh and uh how they're gonna now get
[41:45.320 --> 41:49.160]  even more violent they don't care if you know they're a fraud
[41:49.160 --> 41:52.040]  they've got the guns they've got the government they're coming but first
[41:52.040 --> 41:55.080]  let's break down the cashless society control grid here it is
[41:55.080 --> 41:58.040]  hello this is james corbett of corbett report dot com
[41:58.040 --> 42:01.720]  and welcoming you back to economics 101 and today i'm honored to be joined on the
[42:01.720 --> 42:05.640]  line by alex jones the radio talk show host documentary
[42:05.640 --> 42:09.960]  filmmaker economic analyst political commentator and general
[42:09.960 --> 42:13.960]  mastermind behind info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv
[42:13.960 --> 42:17.880]  alex jones thank you for joining me today on the program
[42:17.880 --> 42:20.840]  quiet introduction thanks for having me i love your
[42:20.840 --> 42:24.920]  important work you're doing excellent well uh today i'd like to talk specifically
[42:24.920 --> 42:28.520]  about the the moves towards the cashless society that we've been
[42:28.520 --> 42:32.840]  seeing coming from every angle lately we've seen this in numerous moves such
[42:32.840 --> 42:35.640]  as uh peter illiff the head of visa europe
[42:35.640 --> 42:39.000]  having said that he wanted to see a cashless society by 2012
[42:39.000 --> 42:42.600]  we've seen the national irish bank moving towards cashless banking
[42:42.600 --> 42:47.560]  we've seen even trivial examples of children's games being changed to use
[42:47.560 --> 42:51.240]  cashless forms of payment we've seen this coming from so many angles that it
[42:51.240 --> 42:55.560]  seems to be a coordinated agenda so what's your take on what this agenda is
[42:55.560 --> 42:59.080]  and why it's so important for the economic elite to bring in a cashless
[42:59.080 --> 43:01.400]  society
[43:01.400 --> 43:07.320]  well it's neo feudalism it's serfdom you have the private banking cartels that
[43:07.320 --> 43:10.440]  control the issuance of currency and credit worldwide
[43:10.440 --> 43:14.360]  openly announcing the formation of a global constitution
[43:14.360 --> 43:20.680]  between the g20 banks openly setting up world government and bypassing the
[43:20.680 --> 43:24.360]  nation states and the people that live in those republics
[43:24.360 --> 43:28.280]  and supposed democracies and so what's happening is you have the
[43:28.280 --> 43:33.400]  artificial fiat parasite economy waging war
[43:33.400 --> 43:40.040]  against the real main street economy or the agrarian or manufacturing
[43:40.040 --> 43:43.960]  economy and everything they do in their own documents is meant to
[43:43.960 --> 43:47.880]  uh make us dependent on government and to be able to track and trace
[43:47.880 --> 43:51.880]  everything we're doing to be able to turn our national ID cards off to be able
[43:51.880 --> 43:56.520]  to stop us from buying and selling and engaging in commerce
[43:56.520 --> 44:01.720]  everything that the world government pushes for is globally controlling
[44:01.720 --> 44:05.400]  taxes and regulations so that you can't have what they call
[44:05.400 --> 44:09.480]  tax havens because we're going to have 80 percent taxes in france
[44:09.480 --> 44:13.160]  that will make people move away from france to save the us where we have
[44:13.160 --> 44:16.280]  roughly 50 percent taxation so all of these
[44:16.280 --> 44:20.760]  collectivist planners uh who run this system
[44:20.760 --> 44:24.520]  talk about how important it is that everything we do be transparent to them
[44:24.520 --> 44:29.080]  and that we have no privacy so they can micromanage and track every facet
[44:29.080 --> 44:34.840]  of our lives and so every major technological rollout that we see
[44:34.840 --> 44:38.200]  is about making us completely dependent on the system
[44:38.200 --> 44:41.560]  and getting us into a system of over taxation regulation
[44:41.560 --> 44:45.160]  so that all your smaller businesses and corporations and
[44:45.160 --> 44:49.800]  family-owned institutions are phased out and only the fortune 100
[44:49.800 --> 44:53.560]  control the world and then they will also continue warring with each other
[44:53.560 --> 44:57.480]  to consolidate the power and so that's what all of this is about
[44:57.480 --> 45:02.200]  they admit that that's what this is about and uh
[45:02.200 --> 45:06.520]  but that's only a means to an end the end
[45:06.520 --> 45:10.840]  is what i cover in my film end game once they have the planetary
[45:10.840 --> 45:15.240]  casual society surveillance grid that the pentagon is designed
[45:15.240 --> 45:19.080]  in place with a license plate reading cameras the face scanning cameras
[45:19.080 --> 45:23.560]  where everyone is buying and selling according to rfid where all products have
[45:23.560 --> 45:27.000]  rfid in it they can track the real world
[45:27.000 --> 45:31.240]  just like google can track cyberspace and it actually allows them
[45:31.240 --> 45:38.200]  to predict human activity uh along the mass or group
[45:38.200 --> 45:41.560]  dynamics right down to individual choices you're going to make
[45:41.560 --> 45:46.440]  with upwards of a 99 percentile accuracy rate so it's also about
[45:46.440 --> 45:50.200]  imitating god they want to control the weather
[45:50.200 --> 45:53.400]  they openly say this they want to control reproduction
[45:53.400 --> 45:59.320]  they want to be able to control all of the agrarian farming and ranching
[45:59.320 --> 46:02.760]  that's going on they want to be able to have omnipresence
[46:02.760 --> 46:07.640]  uh type surveillance so this is literally a crystal ball
[46:07.640 --> 46:11.320]  of control where they know what really makes us tick
[46:11.320 --> 46:15.160]  by tracking our purchases the choices we make what we watch on television
[46:15.160 --> 46:19.560]  where we surf on the internet the laptops watching the school children
[46:19.560 --> 46:25.640]  even when they're at home this is tools in the hands
[46:25.640 --> 46:30.200]  of these people that tyrants like hitler and stalin and now
[46:30.200 --> 46:33.640]  could only dream of or probably couldn't even
[46:33.640 --> 46:37.960]  dream of and that's why i have the website prisonplanet.com
[46:37.960 --> 46:42.040]  because in the elite's own statements they say they are creating
[46:42.040 --> 46:46.440]  a giant worldwide prison and the final
[46:46.440 --> 46:50.680]  equation world government is only the beginning once they have it in place
[46:50.680 --> 46:54.840]  they will then stop just beta testing cancer viruses and vaccines and
[46:54.840 --> 46:58.840]  sodium fluoride other poisons in the water and all the major gmo crops and
[46:58.840 --> 47:02.760]  every study sterilizing uh the rodents and other lab
[47:02.760 --> 47:06.520]  animals that it's tested on they will then accelerate
[47:06.520 --> 47:10.680]  from soft kill to hard kill and kill at least 80 percent
[47:10.680 --> 47:14.040]  of the world's population well that's right this agenda is
[47:14.040 --> 47:18.840]  so vast it's almost mind-boggling and and as vast as it is it's also that
[47:18.840 --> 47:22.760]  ambitious so so what do you see as a time frame for implementation of this
[47:22.760 --> 47:25.720]  cashless society
[47:26.520 --> 47:31.000]  i've seen statistics have already over 90 percent of purchases in europe
[47:31.000 --> 47:37.400]  our digital cashless uh upwards of 90 percent in asia in japan in south korea
[47:37.400 --> 47:41.880]  in uh the major cities of china
[47:41.880 --> 47:47.000]  it's close to that in the united states and they're running psas on television
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  worldwide demonizing cash as if it's dirty and bad
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.920]  because once the cashless grid is in place then the bankers
[47:54.920 --> 47:59.320]  can completely abandon any connection to reality and instead of having fractional
[47:59.320 --> 48:03.320]  reserve banking for every dollar or every yen or
[48:03.320 --> 48:07.560]  euro that the banks have they can loan out 10 dollars
[48:07.560 --> 48:11.320]  of money that doesn't exist now they can take that derivatives
[48:11.320 --> 48:17.720]  model of unlimited uh digital money and uh really expand their monopoly of
[48:17.720 --> 48:21.080]  power over currency and credit and take over the whole planet so we're
[48:21.080 --> 48:24.360]  basically already there they're just beta testing
[48:24.360 --> 48:30.760]  final pieces of it and by 2015 unless people resist uh we will be
[48:30.760 --> 48:33.400]  locked into a cashless society control grid
[48:33.400 --> 48:36.360]  similar to the no fly list i saw governor ridge
[48:36.360 --> 48:40.760]  seven years ago the new head of homeland security when it was first funded
[48:40.760 --> 48:45.000]  as a cabinet position say that if you're not in good favor with the government
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.280]  your national ID card will be turned off you won't be able to work
[48:48.280 --> 48:51.880]  so the no fly will be a no work you won't be able to own a gun
[48:51.880 --> 48:56.360]  there's no judge no jury no due processor just put on these lists
[48:56.360 --> 49:00.200]  uh and they can put whatever disinformation they want in these databases
[49:00.200 --> 49:03.960]  uh and so we're basically there it just gets worse and worse
[49:03.960 --> 49:12.520]  as we go further downhill uh into uh what can only be described as a
[49:12.520 --> 49:15.560]  anti christ type system i mean even if you're not a christian
[49:15.560 --> 49:19.240]  you should be able to look at this and see how it's been set up to be an
[49:19.240 --> 49:23.720]  authoritarian controlling model where you will either buy or sell
[49:23.720 --> 49:27.880]  without this without this mark and it's interesting to note that
[49:27.880 --> 49:32.360]  the the the unified treaties on global standardization for ids
[49:32.360 --> 49:35.960]  have a thumb print a handprint and a face print
[49:35.960 --> 49:42.200]  all rolled into one on the id let he with understanding reckon the number of
[49:42.200 --> 49:45.960]  the beast or it is a human number it's number to six hundred
[49:45.960 --> 49:50.520]  and 66 what is a human number it is a biometric number
[49:50.520 --> 49:54.520]  calculated off of characteristics that are individual
[49:54.520 --> 49:58.680]  uh to each person that's right well just in the last minute or two we have left
[49:58.680 --> 50:01.720]  uh you you mentioned that unless people resist it's probably going to be in
[50:01.720 --> 50:04.360]  place locked into place by 2015 so what are some
[50:04.360 --> 50:09.640]  points of resistance in ways people can fight against this agenda
[50:09.640 --> 50:13.880]  we need to expand our barter community even if you live in a city
[50:13.880 --> 50:18.200]  uh you can uh raise fish you can grow small crops
[50:18.200 --> 50:22.280]  you can start bartering with your neighbors try to use cash as much as you
[50:22.280 --> 50:27.560]  can get your money out of big mega banks uh like JP Morgan Chase
[50:27.560 --> 50:31.800]  Goldman Sachs city group uh and and other big mega banks that are part of

[54:59.560 --> 55:02.760]  there's also been some important new developments only further confirming
[55:02.760 --> 55:06.360]  what we already knew that the five state militia raids were
[55:06.360 --> 55:10.280]  provocateur in stage to create the perception that there are all these
[55:10.280 --> 55:14.200]  right-wing terrorists out there so when the government stages more
[55:14.200 --> 55:18.920]  terror attacks they can be blamed on the american people
[55:18.920 --> 55:22.680]  we're going to be going over that also we're hearing about
[55:22.680 --> 55:26.120]  some of the people that obama wants to nominate for the two supreme court
[55:26.120 --> 55:32.040]  vacancies that are set to be developed in the next year
[55:32.040 --> 55:35.880]  with ruth bader ginsberg and of course just as stevens
[55:35.880 --> 55:39.560]  we're going to get into open discussion of the u.s losing its triple a
[55:39.560 --> 55:43.480]  rating bond and what that will mean to our society
[55:43.480 --> 55:48.200]  also obama says beck limbaugh fuel troublesome political climate this is
[55:48.200 --> 55:56.040]  out of ap of course he did that cbs interview last week
[55:56.040 --> 56:03.400]  we're going to talk about that today as well and get into a
[56:03.400 --> 56:07.560]  several other stacks of important news that i haven't even
[56:07.560 --> 56:10.920]  begun to mention yet more on the government takeover
[56:10.920 --> 56:15.640]  of health care as well but as i start the
[56:15.640 --> 56:18.920]  second hour i will uh in two segments
[56:18.920 --> 56:23.000]  break down the environmental cult that is taking over and
[56:23.000 --> 56:29.080]  running our society also i just want to encourage listeners
[56:29.080 --> 56:33.880]  and fellow info warriors out there to not be depressed by everything that's
[56:33.880 --> 56:37.080]  happening this just proves that those of us that were
[56:37.080 --> 56:40.520]  concerned who studied history those of us that had studied the elites that are
[56:40.520 --> 56:43.640]  in control of our society have been correct
[56:43.640 --> 56:48.520]  and so this evil was already there it was already quietly taking over
[56:48.520 --> 56:51.720]  now it's more in the open because we're very late
[56:51.720 --> 56:56.840]  in the game but the time for denial is over
[56:56.840 --> 57:01.080]  and everyone i talk to is seeing people wake up who laughed at them
[57:01.080 --> 57:05.000]  when they warned them about world government years ago
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.960]  and so i just want to encourage listeners out there
[57:07.960 --> 57:11.960]  to continue to spread the word that's the number one thing is that people be
[57:11.960 --> 57:15.240]  aware of the type of enemy we face knowing is
[57:15.240 --> 57:19.640]  half the battle to use a cheesy gi joe line but that
[57:19.640 --> 57:22.840]  actually goes back to world war two when they said knowing you know who your
[57:22.840 --> 57:26.760]  enemy is and where they are is half the battle the rest is initiative
[57:26.760 --> 57:31.240]  well a lot of people are ready to be awakened but they're not awakened yet
[57:31.240 --> 57:34.840]  and so it is so vital to wake people up and whether you tell folks about the
[57:34.840 --> 57:39.000]  free apple iphone or ipad touch app at info
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.200]  wars dot com even if you don't have an iphone you can send it to friends and
[57:42.200 --> 57:45.960]  family that do you tell people about the free podcast at info wars dot com or
[57:45.960 --> 57:49.320]  local am and fm's that you're listening to it's so essential till

[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.440]  were up against in their authoritarian nature
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:57.320]  when they admit they want authoritarianism they're calling
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.760]  for tyranny it doesn't get any clearer and cut and dry than that
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:05.960]  we're fighting tyrants period michael in california you're on the air

[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:50.920]  faults and i was going up along the west coast of california
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.200]  following that cascadia fault line and i just kept going and it's
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:02:00.760]  started shooting west towards alaska and i get past the horn of alaska and
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:04.920]  there's a stinger of a scorpion staring me right in the face on the bottom of
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:10.120]  the ocean floor so what i did was i zoomed out
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:17.000]  and to my astonishment all the beasts written in prophecy in the bible
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:23.560]  are painted on the ocean floor uh
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.480]  well i'll tell you what send that to show tips and info wars dot com
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:31.800]  that's not really what we cover here on the show you know smoking the towers
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:36.040]  that show the devil or things like that but i'll take a look at it i know in
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.320]  architecture they you know barracks that are swastikas and
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:42.280]  pyramids and that the leader of sassan numerology and
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:45.720]  and architecture we've had some professors on to cover that
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:51.080]  uh let's go ahead and talk to eric in oregon eric you're on the air
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.440]  hey alex thanks for everything you're doing you're making me really inspired
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:58.200]  to do whatever i can to make the most effort to help everyone we can
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:01.800]  we'll thank you sir one thing yeah you're welcome one thing you were saying
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:06.040]  recently was about the green world order and before that article came up with
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.280]  the u.n. releasing that i had seen a hemp company that was promoting this
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:13.960]  green world order uh seeing and i'm like really falling all these companies
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:17.880]  and seeing who's actually legitimate a lot of companies come from china and
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:21.400]  stuff like that so to get something grown america would be great but then you
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.680]  find these companies that are front companies at south seems like they're
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:29.160]  promoting this whole green gender and so i see it being co-opted by
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.520]  people that want to push the global warming agenda through the hemp
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:36.520]  movement or through these uh yeah well that's george soros that's george
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:40.520]  soros i mean just because soros wants marijuana decriminalization
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.720]  doesn't mean that marijuana decriminalization is a bad thing
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:48.280]  it means he knows that of 87 percent of the american people have smoked or do
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.960]  smoke marijuana that it's going to end up being decriminalized
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:55.960]  and he wants to make sure he controls that movement and so absolutely it's
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:59.960]  it's just full of government and foundation infiltrators but that's
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.320]  going to happen with anything that that's why the globalists are in control
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:06.760]  they always try to control all sides of any debate
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.960]  well so the hemp movement is trying to be taken over so if they actually legalize
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:13.000]  one day they'll have all the companies in place to have all the
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.760]  the hemp plastic the hemp wood the hemp construction so that one day that if
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.800]  people are doing it exactly it was big companies
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.240]  80 years ago dupont and alchemical that got hemp banned
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.120]  even the varieties that have no thc because it was better than their
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:30.040]  polyester it was better than cotton it was better for oils you can
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.920]  grow it anywhere it it's a great crop that's why
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:36.520]  George washington grew it great points appreciate the call
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:42.200]  eric urney steve herman brian and others your calls are coming up

[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:32.040]  thousands of prominent environmentalists are on record saying they want a
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:38.520]  organized authoritarian world economy run by them it is about
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:42.680]  feudalism it is about serfdom it is about dominating
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:46.200]  humanity deciding who can have a business
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:50.440]  who can have a job where you can have a factory and they've chosen carbon

[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:19.640]  are rushing in their attempt to be as gods
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.240]  they have created high-tech government and
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:28.840]  private industry reservations that are in many cases 30 years advanced in the
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:33.560]  technology that the general public is privy to
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:36.440]  an example the government now admits they've had
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:40.920]  highly advanced space planes for over 30 years nasa just over the weekend
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:46.680]  started showing some of the vehicles to the public

[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:57.960]  the public is given mindless issues to be concerned with fashion sports
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.400]  things that don't matter their minds are filled with
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:08.200]  pointless trivia meanwhile a cult of eugenicist
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:13.000]  is in control of our society
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:16.840]  as the public begins to wake up to the fact that
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:20.520]  the greenhouse gas taxes are about controlling society controlling
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:26.600]  industry with selective enforcement taxing and regulating our lives
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.800]  as world government has openly announced and we're told that
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:33.640]  indeed a private cartel of banks rule the planet
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:37.400]  people are waking up as they see the climate gate emails as they
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:42.440]  learn about systemic organized system-wide fraud between
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.760]  the un and major universities and major governments
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:52.200]  the people are waking up and saying no
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:57.720]  now we know that for a long time in internal club of
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.040]  rome un documents pentagon documents that in many cases aren't even
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:05.320]  classified they're just not white widely distributed or published or
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:08.280]  covered on the news we've known this is an authoritarian
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:15.640]  tyranny we've known this but now every day i see articles
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:19.720]  written and distributed by the leaders of what is known as the
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:22.680]  environmental movement
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:27.720]  openly saying they are setting up tyranny and that it will be
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:30.360]  authoritarian and that you will have no choice
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.400]  and that they need to come out of the open and physically
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:38.280]  bully the people of the planet and ignore
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:42.920]  the will of the population of the planet
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:47.240]  green piece to global warming skeptics we know where you live

[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.920]  reinvigorate momentum for their stalling global warming agenda
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.640]  while ominously threatening climate skeptics
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.720]  we know where you live that's a quote the article written by green piece
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:32.840]  activists gene from india calls for mass civil disobedience to cut off

[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.720]  skeptical not allowed to catch them in fraud
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:45.960]  notice they say cut off the oxygen well you do cut off the carbon dioxide
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:51.800]  that does cut off the oxygen gene then has a special message for
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:54.600]  roughly half of americans who in the wake of the climate
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:58.680]  gait scandal are now skeptical of man-made global warming

[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:35.800]  and now they're creating the green police and hiring these control freaks to be
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:39.080]  turned loose on the population having outie commercials to show you exactly

[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:05.240]  until our laws do that screw being climate lobbyists screw being climate
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:09.320]  activists it's not working we need an army of climate
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:13.800]  outlaws green peace has not issued a retraction
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:18.840]  of the comments preferring instead to buffer the blog at both beginning and
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:22.760]  end with desperate sounding explanations insisting that the author has
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:25.800]  peaceful intentions the organization has obviously been
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:29.880]  taking a hammering for this
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:35.720]  as it worsens their public relations disaster this is by no means the first
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:39.240]  time global warming adherents have resorted to physical threats in an
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:42.120]  effort to bolster their rapidly crumbling credibility
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:47.880]  on climate change issues in june last year a global warming activist posted
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:51.640]  an article on the talking points of them a website entitled
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:56.520]  at what point do we jail or execute global warming deniers
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:00.440]  shortly after the article was retracted a comment traced back to an
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:03.960]  another prominent global warming activist which appeared on the climate
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:07.880]  progress blog threatened skeptics that an entire generation
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:11.880]  will soon be ready to strangle you with your and your kind
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:15.560]  while you sleep on your beds website owner
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:19.240]  joe rom defended the comments as clearly not a threat
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:26.120]  but a prediction for years climate skeptics have been the target of
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:31.080]  campaigns to denounce them as criminals and traders on the scale of the nazis
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:36.360]  with calls for nurenberg trials a july 2007 senate report detailed how
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:39.400]  skeptical scientists have faced threats and intimidation
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.000]  well just a few months ago cast sonstein said arrest people that deny
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.360]  anthropogenic global warming he's a white house
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:49.160]  regulations are
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:53.960]  is this really the kind of caring sensitive message
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:59.080]  this charity ought to be conveying to the world as james dillingpole
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:03.640]  not to judge by the comments below happy eastergreen peace pr department
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:07.160]  i think you're going to have a busy next few days
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:11.320]  as a recent psychological science study highlighted
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:16.200]  warmest ten not to adhere to the caring sensitive image they portray
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:20.200]  when it comes to their own private lives the study
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:23.480]  was actually pushed by pro warmest and they thought it would show they were
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:27.000]  more loving and show their six times more likely to steal
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.840]  that they hate their fellow man those who
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:34.760]  those who wear what the authors call the halo of green
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:37.880]  consumerism are less likely to be kind to others
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:41.400]  and more likely to cheat and steal summarizes the telegraphs
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:46.440]  in hauling shed faced with various moral choices whether to stick to the rules
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.760]  and games for example or to pay themselves an
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:52.440]  appropriate wage the green participants behaved much
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:56.120]  worse in the experiments than their conventional counterparts
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:01.800]  the short answer to the paper's question is no greens are mean
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:04.440]  despite green pieces efforts at damage control
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:08.200]  there can be little doubt as to the true context of the article
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:12.360]  by first encouraging climate activists to break the law in pursuit of their
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:18.440]  stalling political agenda gene has greased the skids for criminal activity
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:24.040]  concluding that threats to climate skeptics that we know where you live
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:27.640]  is clearly a form of intimidation and an invitation
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:32.280]  for a quote army of climate outlaws to take physical retribution against
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:37.640]  people who disagree with them imagine of info wars dot com put
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:41.640]  an article urging its readers to break the law in order to combat the irs
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.600]  imagine if we told
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:49.640]  irs agents we know where you live we'd be rated quicker than a heartbeat
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:53.240]  and alex jones would be demonized all over the establishment media
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:57.560]  as a dangerous extremist indeed a mere peaceful letter
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:00.680]  writing campaign urging governors to resign
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:04.520]  was leapt upon by the media and the federal government this past week
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:11.000]  as a concerning portend of extremist threat some capitals were locked down
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.840]  an extremist threat posed by constitutionalists despite the fact
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:18.920]  that there was no indication of violence
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:22.280]  when so-called right wingers or libertarians merely write letters
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.880]  urging peaceful political change they are demonized as terrorist hate
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:28.680]  mongers but when greenies openly call for criminal
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:31.880]  behavior allied with thinly veiled threats of physical
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:36.520]  violence it's no big deal we'll see an end in msnbc to vote
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:39.880]  weeks of endless coverage to green pieces threats
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:44.520]  towards people they disagree with there's more chance of keith oberman
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:48.600]  awarding representative hank johnson a major global warming adherent
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:52.760]  is worst person in the world going for hilariously

[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:28.520]  horrifying it's so evil the average person who's good
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:32.600]  can't imagine this is happening
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:37.400]  remember last year the headline in the financial times of london and now for
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:39.800]  world government by their foreign news editor
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:43.560]  where he called for an authoritarian system he said yes we've been building
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:47.960]  it in stealth because you're too stupid to realize
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:53.640]  that you need this well what did james love locks say last week in the
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:57.240]  guardian humans are too stupid to prevent climate change
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:01.080]  in his first in-depth interview since he the theft of the u
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:04.760]  ea emails which the government now has cleared a one-day inquiry
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:08.440]  they say nothing bad happened with climate aid the scientist blames inertia
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.960]  and democracy for lack of action that's a quote now let me read you paul
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:16.920]  watson's detailed article on this top eco fascist calls for end of
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:20.200]  freedom to fight global warming and we're seeing these calls
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:26.280]  everywhere and for physical attacks on those of us that expose these eugenicists

[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:43.160]  and the right wings controlled by the fake terror paradigm calling for secret
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:46.600]  arrest torture and war so they cover the bases as the club of

[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:03.000]  as a means of offsetting climate change has called for a quote
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:08.040]  more authoritative world authoritarian world where freedom comes second to
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:12.520]  tackling what he sees as the devastating effects of global warming

[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:33.240]  on what's for dinner two wolves and a sheep is democracy
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:36.920]  we're a republic if 99 percent say kill the one percent you can't do it in a
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:40.360]  republic so they tried to push democracy
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:43.960]  and get 51 percent to vote for tyranny but if they can't get that
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:46.920]  they'll just go to open tyranny you understand
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:49.800]  i mean just because you get 51 of people to say
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:54.280]  kill anybody with red hair it doesn't happen
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:59.640]  we need a more authoritative world lovelock states authoritarian
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:03.640]  we become a sort of cheeky egalitarian world where everyone
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:08.120]  can have their say this is a quote it's all very well
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:12.360]  but there are certain circumstances a war is a typical example
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:15.080]  where you can't do that the 90 year old proponent
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:20.120]  of the gaya hypothesis ads you've got to have a few people with authority
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:24.120]  who you trust who are running it oh a few people like him
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:28.120]  and they should be very accountable to of course oh very accountable
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:32.600]  authoritarians but it can't happen in modern democracy
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.960]  this is one of the problems i'm still quoting
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:39.480]  what's the alternative to democracy there isn't one but even the best
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:43.320]  democracies agree that when the climate change
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:49.640]  may be an issue as severe as war it may be necessary to put democracy on hold
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:52.840]  for a while till your brainwashed to vote the way they want
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:57.320]  lovelock concludes which people with authority could lovelock
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:00.680]  have in mind for his tyrannical takeover in the name of mother earth
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:03.640]  certainly not the disgrace you and affiliated
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:08.760]  climate scientist whose involvement in several recent scandals even
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:12.520]  lovelock admits is reprehensible
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:17.400]  fudging the data in any way whatsoever is quite literally a sin against the
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:21.000]  holy ghost of science i'm not religious but i put
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.400]  it that way because i feel so strongly it's the one thing you
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:29.560]  do not ever do you've got to have standards he states in the interview
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:34.920]  like authoritarianism lovelock also has little faith in renewable energies
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:39.000]  carbon trading or cap and trade schemes which he previously told the new
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.960]  scientist are verging on a gigantic scam
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:47.080]  well your whole thing is a scam i mean what do you expect
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:51.000]  lovelock repeats this sentiment in the latest interview with the guardian and
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.400]  he goes on to say it's a fraud so perhaps lovelock would point to his
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:29:00.360]  friends at the opium uh excuse me optimum population trust
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:05.160]  that we've had on a notorious uk-based public policy group that campaigns
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:08.200]  for a gradual decline in the global human population
[01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:13.000]  to what it sees as a sustainable level lovelock became a patron of the think
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.600]  tank in 09 in a statement released by the trust
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:20.920]  to mark the appointment lovelock called on the environmental movement as a
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:24.120]  whole to recognize the truth and speak out
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:27.400]  then it goes on with all the calls for global government and forced population
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:32.200]  reduction uh but by different world leaders and
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:36.120]  organizations now when we come back i'm going to
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:41.800]  finish up with how they plan to deploy this authoritarian
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:45.560]  system and how we need to stop it then your phone calls then i'll get into the
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:51.160]  latest on the stage militia stings and the economy stay with us
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:55.000]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:07.080]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:10.440]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:13.160]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:16.360]  performing even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:19.800]  could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:22.920]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:26.440]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce

[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:41.400]  state department memorandum 200 call for just off the top of my head i could
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:46.440]  sit here for the next hour rattling off public policy
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:54.280]  government official policy to set up an oppressive planetary state
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:59.720]  i'm quoting from eco science a planetary regime
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:03.560]  to drug the water to sterilize the population
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:08.040]  to dump the population down to put cancer viruses in the vaccines do you
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:11.960]  think i just get up here and say they're putting cancer viruses
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:15.000]  in the vaccines do you think i just get up here
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.760]  and tell you they're infecting every major vaccine it was on cnn two weeks
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:21.880]  ago that over a million kids got a vaccine with a live pig
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:25.560]  virus that gives humans cancer in it
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:31.240]  they're giving kids all over the world the hp v shot that kills and maims many
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:37.960]  and has live cancer virus in it doesn't protect you
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:44.360]  it's overwhelming it's very hard for me to even get up here on the radio more
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:48.520]  and more i mean i want you to know that this is weighing on me so much
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:53.160]  that i am not even the person to bring you information that's important but who
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:56.360]  else is doing it i don't like it i don't enjoy it
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:35:00.280]  i don't like the fact that i'm here having to cover this i can't believe
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:03.320]  it's so real i can't handle the fact that i know
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:10.680]  it's all real i know it's all going on right now and i want it to stop
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:14.680]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of publications the last two
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:17.800]  years calling for an authoritarian oppressive world
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:20.520]  government they're not denying they're setting up a world
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:23.160]  government anymore they say we're setting it up
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:27.960]  for your own good and that's the way it is and then there's all these well-to-do
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:31.240]  middle-class people that i see at shopping malls and at restaurants on the
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:35.720]  street who laugh at me
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:38.520]  they laugh at me
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:43.320]  because they're so narcissistic they're so self-centered they're so
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:46.760]  dumbed down they're only focused on the 10-mile bike ride they're going to take
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:49.400]  or the decathlon they're going to run or
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:53.240]  they're mistress they're going to have sex with that it's funny they just think
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:56.600]  that it's not their responsibility as men and as
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:00.920]  women to be involved and informed and standing up against evil
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:04.600]  now more and more people aren't laughing i
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:08.360]  had several neighbors come up when i was in the front yard this weekend
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:12.680]  and shake my hand and tell me they appreciate what i'm doing
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:16.040]  and i recognize them as neighbors in the last few years that have drawn by
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:21.160]  driven by and looked fearfully at me but i guess they're starting to realize
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:24.760]  that it's not it's not alex jones that's scary it's the
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:27.400]  information i'm covering and you should be concerned
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:30.840]  you have that fear instinct to get you up off your butt
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:34.760]  to do something about these people that we face
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:38.680]  i mean there's no more denial they're not lying about the world government
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:41.320]  anymore they're shoving in your face and saying
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:44.120]  we're going to spike your water we're going to spike your drugs we're going
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:47.720]  to spike your food and we've already been beta testing it
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:51.160]  and we're sitting here in a petri dish like lab animals
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:55.880]  having these experiments done on us and why can't the cops wake up and join us
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:59.160]  faster why can't the government bureaucrats wake up to what's happening
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:02.120]  because they're comfortable they're on petty power trips
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:05.400]  and they don't want to admit what i'm talking about is real
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:08.600]  they won't even go research it for themselves they don't fundamentally
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:13.640]  care about their family their children or their species
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:16.600]  because at the core they don't have respect for themselves
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:22.520]  they don't realize their destiny is a human and the destiny of this species
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:26.040]  their spirits are corrupt
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:31.160]  that's really what it comes down to i mean if you aren't burning with desire
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:33.560]  to warn people burning with desire to learn this
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:38.840]  information burning with desire to engage the enemy
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:43.960]  i can't handle it i can't handle chills running up and down my spine
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:47.080]  five six hours a day
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:54.200]  and then seeing other people who have no idea how perilous this is no idea how
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:58.360]  real it is no idea how there's mountains of just
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:02.120]  out in the open evidence
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:06.920]  sure 10 15 years ago people talk about a world government plan
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:11.240]  to use environmentalism to bring in an oppressive police state
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:17.320]  to then straightjacket society to then carry out an orderly extermination
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:20.920]  but now it's out in the open
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:27.080]  now it's out in the open
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:33.480]  a green world order an authoritarian oppression
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:35.960]  in your face saying they're going to be authoritarian
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:39.240]  that they are authoritarian that yeah they built it in stealth because they
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:43.400]  know best and you're a fool and when you catch them in fraud they
[01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:46.840]  have a one-day inquiry and say there was no fraud when it's admitted there was
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:49.240]  fraud
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:54.120]  they are a conscious group of elitists that hate their fellow man
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:58.840]  when i love my fellow man when i see people dumb down and stupid and petty
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:03.080]  i feel sorry for them i want to uplift them the elites do everything they can
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:06.520]  to dumb people down and and and to fill our minds with
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:10.200]  mindless pointless fluff and then they sit there
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:14.040]  it's like breaking a cow's legs walking with a baseball bat
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:17.320]  breaking its legs and watching it flopping around on the ground while
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:21.240]  wolves tear its guts out and saying look at that stupid cow it can't get up on
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:26.040]  its feet and defend itself you break our legs
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:29.800]  so you can bring in your control grid so nobody can challenge you
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:33.000]  you reduce the average IQ by 20 points that's what
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.400]  just drinking one part per million florida does in every major study
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:41.080]  with just five years of drinking it during development
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:43.880]  it's not as bad as you drink it later it's still poisonous to your whole system
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:47.640]  but you develop the neural pathways so it doesn't matter if you have massive
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:51.720]  brain die off you could still operate that's the beauty of the human mind
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:54.200]  that's why they say you only use 10 percent of your brain less because most of
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:58.360]  your brain dies by the time you get old so you need that what you've got
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:04.360]  it's like a gas tank as the brain cells die you make new neural connections
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:07.720]  you use old pathways
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:12.680]  break our legs and you sit there watching humanity and squalor and pain
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:15.640]  i read the royal commission report from 49 how they plan to
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:18.520]  destroy the third world not let them industrialize
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:22.280]  how the population will then explode how that would be used as a people bomb
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:25.720]  to control them and keep them down and then later you would just exterminate
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:30.120]  that mass talk about evil and you sit up there
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:33.080]  telling us all day how much you love us and how good you are and how we're just
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:38.840]  a cancer how we're a virus and you're going to eradicate us for our own good
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:50.360]  your water is being poisoned with hundreds of deadly chemicals by design
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:54.440]  your sperm count is down above 85 percent in every country that fluoridates
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:57.640]  you are being injected with time delayed
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:02.200]  cancer viruses that embed in your cell structure DNA
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:07.960]  the RNA embeds the GMO food has been designed to sterilize you and to attack
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:10.840]  all your major organs that's mainstream admitted
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:14.040]  they just say it's an accident
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:21.880]  you are being soft killed you are being intoxicated with poison you are being
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:26.440]  murdered slowly that's what these psychopaths are doing
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:30.120]  they are taking over the health care they are taking over all facets of
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:33.640]  industry they are brainwashing your children right now
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:37.000]  in public schools and if you can't get your kids out of the public schools
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.680]  because they've gotten you financially to a point where you can't afford it
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:44.680]  you can at least turn the television off and at least explain to your children
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:48.280]  how you're all under attack and your children's instincts will kick in
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:52.360]  and they will stop rebelling against you if you do it early enough
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:55.160]  i will assure you people's children in ancient times
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:59.160]  did not rebel against their parents like they do today i've studied the history
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:02.200]  especially in oppressed groups the children were absolutely on their
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:07.080]  family's team but you weren't ever taught
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:10.120]  how to have your children on your side in fact you're taught
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:14.040]  through the psychological systems today how to turn your children against you
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:17.160]  and you wonder why your children get worse and worse they know in every study
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:22.040]  then when they started death education in 1991 in public schools
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:26.440]  that within five to six years suicide doubled and now it's triple what it was
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:30.200]  in the 1980s and they have all these specials about bullying and suicide
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:34.200]  and all it does is increase the suicide introducing the idea of suicide that
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:39.560]  teach the kids how to commit suicide when they tell them don't commit suicide
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:44.120]  it's just pure darkness by these mentally ill
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:47.240]  psychiatrists and psychologists who have the highest
[01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:54.440]  rate of suicide of any group oh they're intelligent but they're
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:59.560]  they're sick and twisted they are insane but they're also conscious these
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:03.800]  these are horrible control freaks who know how humans work
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:08.840]  and are doing whatever they can to hurt you they enjoy that power over you it's
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:12.520]  the ultimate power trip it's what authoritarian death spots
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:16.040]  and their servant class always do in every case
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:19.080]  i'm only telling you history and what's currently happening
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:22.680]  and i just read to you quote after quote an article after article
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:27.720]  where they're openly saying okay we can't pass this through our legislatures
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:32.680]  we're going to authoritarian force this through through the executive branches
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:36.040]  and we're going to start bullying and burning more things down and attacking
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:42.760]  more people
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:47.240]  they mean business
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:51.000]  because we are kicking their butt peacefully
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.360]  with the information the people are waking up that's why they're trying to
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:58.120]  provocateur militias nationwide to start a war
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:01.640]  that's why they're setting people up
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:05.320]  because they want an excuse to come in with violence against us but they need
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:09.160]  to trigger violence first so they have a pretext to come after
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:13.080]  the american people and the people of the world
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:16.360]  and if you do catch one of these environmentalists trying to burn your
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:20.920]  house down you are it's legal and lawful in all but a few us
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:26.680]  cities should defend yourself it's time to arm yourself work
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:30.280]  for peace work for a peaceful restoration of
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:34.840]  the republic against these revolutionaries
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:37.960]  they're funded by the same banks that funded the fascist and the communist
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:40.840]  and his girl quickly wrote at georgetown he was allowed into the
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:45.880]  globalist annals of os s and cia they control the
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:49.080]  authoritarian spectrum and they give you false choices
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:52.520]  within the authoritarian spectrum
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:58.200]  we work for peace we prepare for war
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:06.520]  and we study the art of war for knowledge and defense
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:10.600]  by the way many philosophers said that that isn't from star wars though you've
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:14.120]  heard it there the jedi never uses the force
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:20.760]  for attack only for knowledge and defense that goes back to the philosophers
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:26.200]  leaked un documents reveal plan for green world order
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:32.040]  by 2012 leaked policy documents reveal the united nations plans to create a
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:35.640]  green world order by 2012 which will be enforced by a
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:39.240]  structure of global governance and funded by a gargantuan 45 trillion
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:43.240]  transfer of wealth from the richest countries as the globalist insidious
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:46.360]  plan to centralize power crushed sovereignty
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:50.440]  while devastating the economy is exposed once again
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:54.360]  as we warned at the time this failure of coban hagan in december
[01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:58.200]  did not spell the end of the global warming heist but merely a roadblock
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:02.840]  in the un's agenda to create a world government funded by taxes paid by you
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:06.520]  on the very substance you exhale carbon dioxide
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:09.560]  by using the justification of the vehemently debunked hoax
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:13.560]  that carbon dioxide is a deadly threat to our planet the un is already working
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:17.480]  to resurrect the failed coban hagan argument with a series of new coban hagan
[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:21.400]  process negotiations set to take place in april may and june
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:25.560]  leaked planning documents obtained by fox news lift the lid off the un's plan
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:29.320]  to impose global governance by the end of 2012 world summit of sustainable
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:32.520]  development in rio which will mark the 20th anniversary
[01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:36.120]  since the notorious earth summit held in the same city
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:40.680]  where morris strong said it is our job to destroy industrial society
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:44.520]  the new rio summit will end according to un documents obtained by fox news
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:48.120]  with a focused political document presumably laying out the framework
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:51.720]  for international commitments to the new green world order that's a quote from
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:54.600]  the document now
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:59.080]  as we told you back in december when coban hagan failed that they announced
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:02.840]  that the g20 banks that run this would just start levying taxes through the
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:06.040]  executive and paying it to themselves and that's now been announced
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:12.760]  two weeks ago by gordon brown that that's actually in
[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:16.040]  invisible empire by the way that that's that's how up to date this film as we're
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:22.680]  working on it two weeks ago
[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:26.200]  and it goes on to talk about a radical transformation
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:31.640]  an authoritarian system
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:36.760]  so remember what they're doing with your school children
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:40.280]  with your brownies and girl scouts and boy scouts
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:44.200]  what they're doing at your churches well-meaning preachers well-meaning
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:47.080]  scout leaders well-meaning public school teachers
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:50.600]  up there telling your children the earth is dying we've got to have global
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:54.120]  government that's in the textbooks we've got to have a new world order
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:58.840]  we've got to restrict what we're doing your parents are bad i've seen that in
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:02.040]  time magazine newsweek for kids i've seen at the new york times
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:05.160]  where they al gore what last year gave a speech
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:08.920]  gives them all over the country to elementary students saying your parents
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:13.640]  are bad you've got to report them you've got to tell them they're wrong i mean
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:18.280]  you let the state come in and you let criminal thugs come in and tell
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:21.640]  your children to turn against you the most fundamental
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:27.000]  outrageous authoritarian tyranny and they're all over the news announcing
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  they're going to get more aggressive with people
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.680]  and they're i've got news articles all over the u.s canada england europe
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:36.120]  australian new zealand of the green police just like in the outy ad but
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:40.840]  real police in white and green uniforms and white and green trucks
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:44.600]  creating swat teams and harassing people and saying they're going to arrest you
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:47.160]  for the wrong light bulbs with the wrong toilet
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:50.760]  and they've got all these horribly dumbed down violent kids that have played
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:54.200]  video games filled with violence who just want power
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:58.600]  that are now 20 25 years old getting uniforms and getting weapons systems
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:02.040]  who've been taught to get violent with us
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:05.160]  and then god forbid when they're beating you up or robbing your house that you
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:08.280]  defend yourself you're going to be called a terrorist
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:11.160]  and they want you to defend yourself but what else can you do
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:15.160]  they want a war with you they want blood like every other tyrant
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:18.520]  and their servants have always wanted they recruit scum
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:21.800]  they recruit control freaks they recruit criminal
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:25.160]  filth and the government is run universally
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:28.840]  by criminal filth at the top and it's time for the military
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:32.440]  it's time for the police to read what these enemies actually say
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:36.280]  and to realize they're not a bunch of tree petting tree hugging dolphin hugging
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:42.200]  well-meaning idiots these are a murder gang of pirates and thugs
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:47.800]  openly poisoning your water supply that's why your testosterone levels down
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:50.760]  that's why your sperm counts down that's why women can't have children
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:54.280]  that's why your thyroid screwed up over 30 percent of women now and your hair
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:57.400]  is falling out you're being chemically savaged every
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:00.600]  single day you think you're part of the government
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:03.080]  fools and i'm talking to this even the environmental
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:06.360]  servants you don't know what you're part of
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:10.200]  but i'm here telling you what you're part of i'm here reading what your capos
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:13.800]  and what your bosses are saying and what they're setting up and what they're
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:17.720]  doing so i tell you now you don't have to choose
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:21.320]  a side you are on the side of humanity fools
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:24.760]  those of you that serve this you may play a mental mind trick
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:28.120]  with yourself and tell yourself you're part of the winning team
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:32.840]  and you get off on that primitive feeling of power over society
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:37.080]  but i tell you from the bottom of my heart and from the depths of my intellect
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:41.880]  and all the research we've done humanity now faces the greatest evil in its
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:45.080]  history and it is up to all of us who see this
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:48.200]  corruption and see this threat to our species
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:53.080]  to become fully informed and to focus mentally and prepare ourselves and to
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:57.080]  go out to every hill and mountain every valley
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:03.480]  and to warn the people hi this is alex jones did you know that the global
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:06.040]  elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:09.720]  storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:12.840]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold
[01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:16.120]  it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:18.440]  and it's possible that could even happen again
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:22.200]  so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:25.160]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival
[01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:29.640]  seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food

[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:32.280]  you are on the side of humanity no matter what position of power you have
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:34.680]  these elitists have only lied to themselves and don't know that they're
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:39.960]  connected to everyone else and to all the servants who are on these
[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:44.760]  power trips these petty power trips you are under attack just as much as
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:48.040]  i'm under attack or my staff is under attack
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:51.640]  and this attack is out in the open there's no more time for denial
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:55.640]  there's no more time to play games you need to research the information we
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:59.400]  cover an end game blueprint for global enslavement you need to research
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:02.520]  all the documents and articles we post on a daily basis
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:08.120]  as our enemies say they want to oppress us and hurt us and yes kill us
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:11.160]  that's what other dictators did that's what other corrupt systems did that's
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:13.800]  their nature that's the type of people that get
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:17.400]  into power when governments and societies go bad
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:21.640]  the mindset of the psychopath of the sadist of the control freak
[01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:27.000]  of the power tripping evil types that are out there is then manifest throughout
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.280]  the country throughout the empire throughout the world
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:34.680]  when these people get into control it's like if you own your house
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:37.640]  you decide what color to have the roof what color to paint it
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:40.840]  you decide what fixtures you have you decide what color carpet
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:44.680]  you decide what books are on the shelves well look at the books on our shelves
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:47.560]  as a society look at the television look at the culture
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:50.920]  look at what the elite is pushing look at what they're into look at what they
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:55.640]  say they are erecting look at what they've built
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:56:02.760]  look at their fruits and there's no time for denial anymore
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:07.320]  we have to make a decision as a society as a species we have to decide what our
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:12.280]  priorities are is your priority just enjoying
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:16.440]  yourself is your priority just having fun
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:21.320]  you've been beguiled into this system to blind yourself so you don't see what's
[01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:23.160]  happening so they can control the world
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:27.240]  so they can control human destiny the most horrific
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:31.160]  individuals the world has ever seen and control of our destiny
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:35.000]  that's what this is about we all die but our species goes on
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:38.040]  we would have no freedom we would have no free market we would have no
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:41.400]  private property if we didn't have people that stood up for it earlier
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:44.360]  we owe everything to our ancestors and our ancestors
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:50.920]  are gonna not just roll in their graves but our progeny will look back on us
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:57.560]  their ancestors with shame history is watching right now
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:01.400]  so make a decision to get really focused on these issues and to get really
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:05.640]  informed to not believe me to research it for yourself and find out
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:09.560]  just how serious this is and to support us we need treasure
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:13.880]  to fund this operation we need funds we need you to buy the books

[02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:34.440]  april 2010 i've looked at all the different
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:39.000]  factors that are converging and have been saying for over three months that i
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:42.120]  believe the government is going to start staging terror attacks
[02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:45.640]  and fake raids on militias and tea parties and others
[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:49.320]  as a demonization tactic that's coming up later in the hour also going to the
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:52.040]  economy also illinois congressman i don't worry
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:55.000]  about the constitution we're going to play that video
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.960]  we are simulcasting at prism planet dot tv i want to get into the attacks
[02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:04.120]  on free speech that are going on and are being called for as well
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:07.160]  but right now let's start going to your phone calls
[02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:11.080]  let's talk to ernie in california thanks for holding ernie you're on the year
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:14.600]  yeah it's okay i got just three things first of all i like the people
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:17.720]  to get in touch and understand how evil these bankers are
[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:22.280]  to read the 1944 breton woods conference
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:25.000]  so that they know that all these bankers report everybody's money together
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.600]  before the war was even over couple other things first of all the stupid
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:31.800]  congressman that says the island going to tip over hilarious
[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:35.880]  the other thing clinton admitting that his free trade agreement
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:39.720]  wiped out the right to growing for hating basically made them starving
[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:44.520]  and the last thing i like to ask what about the state bank of north dakota
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:49.240]  and how that runs totally separate and isn't having no problems why can't
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:53.400]  every other state do with the state of north dakota did in 1919
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:57.800]  absolutely that's a big part of the solution is getting the power of credit
[02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:01.960]  in the government hands instead of the government violating the constitution
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:05.000]  and giving up that power and giving it to a private banking cartel
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.080]  under the 1913 fellow reserve act yeah and one other thing just for the guy the
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:12.680]  guy who found a little stone the first caller they did find a giant pyramid

[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:43.240]  things here uh... let's go ahead and talk to steven
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:47.000]  illinois steve you're on the air go ahead
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.160]  uh... you know ronald reagan have made me up and take
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:54.600]  when he brought in two things back in 1980
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:59.320]  one was deregulation the other one was tax incentives to move big business
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:04.280]  offshore and they're still doing that today but it wasn't real deregulation
[02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:07.400]  they just gave the banks and mega corporations more power to get more
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:11.960]  government contracts it's not deregulation it's not privatization
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:15.000]  to have corporations become government
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.200]  yeah i wish uh... we have rob paul on two
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:21.800]  he would bring up something about throwing people in jail
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:26.760]  i i never hear of anybody doing that you know uh... i'm no johnny come lately
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:31.000]  with all this stuff i wish when uh... just been sure it comes on tomorrow
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:34.120]  he wouldn't drop the ball in this one maybe uh...
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:37.640]  don't worry about nine eleven as much as nine ten
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:42.600]  billions was traded in airline stocks they were going to follow it it was all
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:45.800]  computerized but uh... they had died on the vine
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:48.280]  somehow and they said this would be a piece of cake
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:51.160]  following who brought these towers down that because
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:54.760]  there's there's right that was in ap and roiders and then it all got shut down
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:57.480]  when it turned out the executive director of the cia
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:04:01.560]  was running the record put options on american and united buzzy crown guard
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:05.480]  uh... really good points uh... you know i haven't dropped the ball on that

[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:54.760]  to herman in new york you're on the air herman
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:58.040]  uh... it's a little alec can you hear me yes i can
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:01.240]  uh... yes i have a three quick questions all right my first question
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:05.800]  would be how is it that somebody like me who lives in a big city like new york
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:10.440]  uh... how can it how can i go about getting firearms to defend myself
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:14.920]  when things start to collapse well you live in one of three cities where the
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:19.800]  second amendment is basically banned they've lost it the federal court
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:24.680]  uh... the supreme court uh... in dc saying that that you know that you can't
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:28.600]  not allow people to be armed and then they get raped robbed and killed
[02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:32.120]  uh... but the cities don't care they're still just
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:35.400]  carrying that through if you get a background check and give tens of
[02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:39.160]  thousands of dollars of politicians in campaign contributions they'll make a
[02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:41.720]  phone call and you can get a concealed carry
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:47.000]  all the goldman sacks execs have them uh... the off duty cops get to have them
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:50.520]  bureaucrats and politicians get to have them and taxpayer paid for bodyguards
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:54.280]  in many cases there was a bloomberg article a few months ago in fact pull
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:55.880]  that up on screen for folks
[02:11:55.880 --> 02:12:00.440]  uh... i believe the headline was uh... goldman sacks arming themselves against
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:01.800]  public
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:03.720]  and uh...
[02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:06.360]  so sorry you live in
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:08.760]  the model of what they want to make america
[02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:13.560]  a haven for criminals in and out of government criminals at every level
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:17.800]  uh... just like uh... many u.s states now you can't have burglar bars to even
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:21.640]  protect yourself it's about making you easy for the criminal class to have their
[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:23.960]  way with you
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:26.920]  okay and my second uh... question is
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:29.960]  uh... the nanny state for what i've studied in history
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:34.440]  uh... i believe it began with f d r is new deal but i like i hear a lot of
[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:36.440]  patriots saying how great
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:39.960]  f d r was uh... can you speak to that real quickly
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:43.640]  well i mean i like webster tarpley and i appreciate your call herman uh...
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:45.960]  but i disagree with him about
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:47.640]  f d r being good
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:50.200]  it's true that right wing
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:53.400]  hitler-backed forces press got bush
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:56.680]  george herbert walker bush's father george w's grandfather
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:12:59.880]  it did come out congressional hearings it was confirmed they tried to hire the
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:01.400]  head of the marine corps
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:06.280]  to stage a military overthrow of the u s to then link up with hitler
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:07.480]  and so people like
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:09.720]  tarpley then like
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:12.920]  f d r because he didn't go along with that
[02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:16.040]  but f d r did start the process of domesticating and getting people
[02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:17.400]  dependent
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:20.680]  uh... but the nanny state is like
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:22.920]  domesticating pigs
[02:13:22.920 --> 02:13:25.720]  and i've told this many times but going back thousands years ago
[02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:28.360]  you can domesticate wild hogs a day like this
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:30.400]  you put up a fence area
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:32.840]  you put some grain in her corn every day
[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:35.200]  for a few months the pigs get accustomed
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:37.720]  uh... to being in the enclosure
[02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:39.260]  and then generally
[02:13:39.260 --> 02:13:42.980]  with bows and arrows or throwing spears or pets
[02:13:42.980 --> 02:13:46.200]  you would kill the adults once you got inside the enclosure
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:49.280]  once they were trained to all go inside in a pack or a herd
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:51.240]  and you would keep the baby piglets
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:54.120]  and then raise them in smaller pens and pet them and
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:55.640]  feed them and be nice to them
[02:13:55.640 --> 02:13:58.040]  so that they thought of you as part of their group
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:13:59.680]  but then a few times a year you
[02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:02.240]  take them down the road so you don't upset the other pigs and
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:04.040]  you slit their throat
[02:14:04.040 --> 02:14:07.440]  and so that's what the new deal is we're just a bunch of domesticated animals
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:08.120]  now
[02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:10.360]  and now they're saying you're not going to get your health care we're not we're
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:11.360]  you know
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:13.760]  you blew your knee out will give you some steroids for it
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:14.720]  not a surgery
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:17.440]  oh you need eye surgery you're above sixty you're not getting it oh
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:20.260]  you got a way to year and a half for a brain surgery
[02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:22.760]  and of course the insurance companies are eugenicist and they get all the
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:24.160]  profit and tax money
[02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:27.680]  then they give you horrible care as dr ron paul agreed earlier
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:30.760]  and so the right wing will never talk about the fact that it's really a
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:32.760]  insurance banking scam
[02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:34.320]  because
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:36.320]  they're bought and paid for by those interest
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:39.480]  the insurance companies play along with the ruse like they're against it
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:41.680]  the left then thinks they're getting something free
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:43.840]  when it doesn't get delivered
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:47.040]  in a few years they'll then push total government health care as ron paul said
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:48.160]  in the first hour
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:53.720]  we're on the same page because we showed you the same enemy
[02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:57.040]  people who are on the government dole think the government's their friend like
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:14:57.920]  a pig
[02:14:57.920 --> 02:14:59.360]  when they come over and throw
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:01.080]  some sloppy and
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:03.840]  they look up lovingly at their master not knowing in a few months they're gonna
[02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:05.160]  be hanging up other legs
[02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:08.160]  with their throat being slit to bleed them out
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:09.600]  they don't care
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:12.920]  they don't know their master gives them water that sedates them and hurts them
[02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:13.880]  because
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:17.000]  a pig has value in a domestication situation
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.360]  to the elite there's six and a half billion of us
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:21.480]  there is no value
[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:25.080]  so so so we have a negative value to the controllers
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:27.480]  uh... let's go ahead and take another call here
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:29.560]  uh... let's go ahead and talk to
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:32.900]  brian in michigan you're on the air
[02:15:32.900 --> 02:15:36.800]  hi i'd like to talk about the earthquake and why i think they're being
[02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:38.360]  called by heart
[02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:42.720]  i did i was uh... on the internet uh... doing research and i found a graph
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:44.800]  from a government study
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:46.200]  uh... in the
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:49.920]  entire twentieth century the average number of earthquakes between magnitude
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:52.120]  of six and eight were around three
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:56.440]  but in the last five years the number has gone up to twenty five and thirty
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:58.000]  uh... i also
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.800]  you guys are having uh... they're having record numbers of six and above all
[02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:03.720]  the way up to eight pluses
[02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:05.440]  uh... but you have to understand that's what the
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:08.640]  phony and i'm not knocking you but let's talk about statistics here
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:10.400]  that's what the controllers do
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:13.320]  they show you a ten-year period where it gets hotter
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:17.560]  and they say in the last eighty years or ninety years it's never been this hot
[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:20.040]  they don't tell you the ice core sample show
[02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:22.840]  uh... just nine thousand years ago uh...
[02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:26.360]  that uh... during the beginning of the bronze age the temperature on average
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:28.240]  was almost ten degrees higher
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:30.840]  than it is now and so just because
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:31.960]  since they've been
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:35.120]  registering things with seismographs last sixty years
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:38.240]  and it hasn't been as intensified or is
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:40.760]  it's just like they say there's more tornadoes now
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:42.080]  well that's because they've got
[02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:42.960]  more
[02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:47.320]  uh... of the Doppler radar and other systems that catch the smaller tornadoes
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:48.320]  but if you look at
[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:49.200]  more
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:50.440]  uh... earthquakes
[02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:53.780]  there been earthquakes so bad that areas the size of uh...
[02:16:53.780 --> 02:16:54.760]  colorado
[02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:56.640]  blow completely wide open
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:17:00.120]  and magma shoots five thousand feet in the air and the entire earth gets
[02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:02.240]  partially dark for twenty years
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:04.200]  i mean they have met
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:06.280]  where i sit in austin was
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:10.120]  was nothing but volcanoes in the past and uh... they're now all extinct or
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:11.040]  dormant
[02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:13.160]  and so
[02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:15.640]  if you look at a hundred-year cycle that is true
[02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:17.520]  that the last fifty-plus years
[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:18.880]  you can't go back a hundred
[02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:21.040]  that there are more intense
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:23.520]  uh... earthquakes as of late
[02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:27.240]  but i mean if you go back to the history books say two thousand years ago
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:31.000]  roam was constantly having volcanoes and giant earthquakes
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.000]  uh... and and and and now they're not having as many
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.960]  i mean if you've seen a volcano blow up and kill an entire city
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:38.280]  like pompe
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:40.280]  no you haven't seen that recently
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:43.520]  uh... so i mean we are continents
[02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:46.600]  it is it's almost what hank uh... johnson said
[02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:49.240]  kind of an idiot savant
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:51.280]  islands aren't floating on the water
[02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:52.520]  but islands
[02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:55.440]  are the tips of mountains and hill ranges
[02:17:55.440 --> 02:17:57.840]  that are floating on magma
[02:17:57.840 --> 02:17:58.840]  okay
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:02.440]  so uh... but but the government did say a ninety seven they have seismic
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:05.400]  earthquake weapons we know they've been working on it
[02:18:05.400 --> 02:18:07.360]  and so it could be that
[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:09.960]  it's just having a whole bunch of earthquakes
[02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:13.360]  all the sudden doesn't mean that's man go ahead
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:16.200]  okay uh... this year uh... i've
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:19.560]  and that there's already been seventy-two earthquakes
[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:23.240]  and last year there were only twenty-nine there there's been uh...
[02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:25.320]  recorded earthquake every day
[02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:28.680]  and the first day of spring with the exception of march twenty-fourth and i
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:31.000]  also think the timing of it
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.680]  uh... being that this is on the heels after the copenhagen treaty and any
[02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:36.080]  lover coming out
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:38.200]  and that this is the cause of global warming
[02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:42.480]  well i agree with you that it's suspicious that they continue to hit
[02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:46.480]  mega population centers the very city in haiti that's the biggest
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:48.280]  the biggest city in chile
[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:52.720]  uh... you know hitting san diego l.a. biggest cities on the west coast
[02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:54.520]  it is suspicious
[02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:55.900]  that they can be
[02:18:55.900 --> 02:18:59.160]  you've always had big earthquakes but generally they're out in the ocean
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:00.640]  uh... or there's somewhere
[02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:02.720]  and then people say well you're only paying attention to the ones that are in
[02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:03.780]  big cities no
[02:19:03.780 --> 02:19:07.060]  i've looked at the graph you're looking at most of these big earthquakes are
[02:19:07.060 --> 02:19:09.840]  happening in very dense population areas
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:12.160]  but according to uh... congressman
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:14.760]  hank johnson that may be because the people are sitting on the edge of
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:16.960]  california that's weighing the island
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:19.400]  so it may be about to capsize
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:22.840]  that's just as real as global warming
[02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:24.040]  yes
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:25.120]  uh... what
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:28.520]  that's all i got uh... thank you but i mean thank you sir but you understand my
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:32.120]  point about you can't compare a hundred years to another hundred years
[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:34.720]  but when they say we need to stabilize our climate
[02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:38.160]  the climate's never been stable we're a giant planetoid
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:40.760]  that's got an atmosphere thinner than the skin of an apple
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:43.560]  hurdling through space at twenty something thousand miles an hour
[02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:45.800]  around a gigantic sun
[02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:48.440]  nothing stable about that there's a giant asteroid belt
[02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:50.600]  comets come flying by us
[02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:52.040]  nothing stable about
[02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:54.680]  the government says everything's got to be stable the temperatures got to be
[02:19:54.680 --> 02:19:56.640]  seventy six degrees year-round
[02:19:56.640 --> 02:19:58.760]  mommy is it true we used to have
[02:19:58.760 --> 02:19:59.480]  seasons
[02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:01.480]  still a rescue for saying that
[02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:06.040]  did you know that there are tiny radio transmitters also known as rfid chips
[02:20:06.040 --> 02:20:09.440]  in millions of passports credit cards and licenses in the current state of the
[02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:13.120]  economy it's no surprise that identity theft has increased with current
[02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:16.880]  technology these can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal
[02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:19.720]  your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your
[02:20:19.720 --> 02:20:23.840]  wallet or purse think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener

[02:20:27.400 --> 02:20:31.280]  you push a button and these tiny radios give out personal information put a
[02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:32.720]  stop to identity theft

[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:36.120]  newspaper last week there they're announcing a 30 million dollar detention
[02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:42.720]  center that 12,000 people in this area are supposed to pay for and I'm wondering
[02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:46.880]  if you've got any advice we're having some upcoming local meetings where we
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:51.160]  can go and talk about this I'm wondering if you were at this meeting what would
[02:24:51.160 --> 02:24:54.960]  you do what what sort of things would you say in order to help the public
[02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:59.160]  awaken to maybe this is our potential FEMA camp I don't know what it is okay
[02:24:59.160 --> 02:25:02.400]  okay Brian let me let me tell you how to beat it and I appreciate your call you
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:07.440]  go nearby to harden Montana and you show how they paid 27 million dollars for a
[02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:11.280]  facility three years ago that they completed that no one has ever been in
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:16.240]  and how it's a scam they take your taxpayer money the bonds never get
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:20.080]  paid for but the people that get to build the structure and get the payment
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:26.760]  they make 27 million dollars okay it's a big scam and you also point out that we
[02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:30.400]  have more prisons per capita than any other country in the world seven plus
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:34.800]  million people in the system over five million behind bars and that this is not
[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:39.960]  the type of economic development you need in your city in your town and it's
[02:25:39.960 --> 02:25:44.280]  just that simple that's our fastest growing industry is government and of
[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:49.440]  that unit is detention centers both public and private and absolutely I
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:55.840]  mean I mean it's a FEMA camp in the case of Tulia Texas the town paid for in
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:58.800]  that case I think it was only like seven million dollars I'm going from memory
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:03.120]  back in the late 80s to build it then there was no one to put in the detention
[02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:06.840]  center that the mayor and the police chief and others own to stake in and
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:10.440]  their families had the contracts for the upkeep and they had family that were
[02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:13.920]  jail guards and there was no one to pay for it so they just started writing
[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:18.880]  tickets taking houses planning drugs on people and it turned out more than half
[02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:23.760]  of the black population of the town was in the jail but also a lot of white
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:27.840]  people so I mean it's simple they just build prisons hire cops and start
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:31.680]  throwing us in them and make money off of it this is how they've legalized
[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:35.880]  slavery and they call it law and order meanwhile the illegal aliens are all
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:42.520]  about the law now let's talk to Jeff in Nevada Jeff you're on the air yes Alex
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:48.160]  I'm I am probably a bigger sports fan than you but I haven't actually tuned
[02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:53.600]  into an NBA game for a while I tuned into one last night and I'll tell you I
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:59.220]  could not think of a better example of what Alan Watt would call predictive
[02:26:59.220 --> 02:27:05.160]  programming they actually had Grant Hill on a commercial of pushing vaccines for
[02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:11.400]  teens oh yeah that means it's pro-zac it's military ads it's brainwashing it's
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:16.640]  it's terror updates it's all part of and again I'm a sports fan too but I can't
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:20.600]  spend my time on that because we're going to hell in a handbasket and it's all
[02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:26.240]  a bunch of programming it's almost like you're watching a commercial for the
[02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:31.160]  New World Order mixed between possessions of the basketball I mean I was
[02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:35.480]  absolutely or sir that's why I can't watch television even for relaxation now
[02:27:35.480 --> 02:27:39.040]  because I see the propaganda and once you're awake you will see it and it's
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:45.800]  like a movie in the 80s of a futuristic 2010 police state it's like the running
[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:52.600]  man the ads on TV from the running man are the ads that are on TV now Alex if
[02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:58.520]  it wasn't so serious where people's lives were at stake you would think it was a
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:04.160]  joke you would think that they were doing this as just some massive joke to
[02:28:04.160 --> 02:28:08.920]  make fun of the whole idea well that is a massive joke it is a massive joke for
[02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:13.000]  those that are awake and aware but for people that think the government likes
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:16.360]  them and everything's fun oh the government's gonna take my pension fun
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:21.960]  and for the banks oh goody you know it's all goody again it's all designed for
[02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:24.840]  people that barely pay attention that's why I said in the last three months
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:30.680]  they're gonna bust militias was because I saw the preconditioning for it and it's
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:34.120]  just for people kind of barely paying attention what the militia killed their
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:38.640]  cat that sounds ridiculous to anybody else turns out it's not true it was just
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:43.720]  meant to make you hate them oh they wanted to kill cops again it's designed
[02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:47.720]  to make cops hate the public and and and so it's all just background noise
[02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:51.960]  because they know the average person isn't conscious go ahead tell tell me
[02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:57.040]  about what you saw I'll tell you I well you basically I saw they have their
[02:28:57.040 --> 02:29:02.360]  talking point they've got I was writing them down I mean I haven't done this
[02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:07.080]  before because I haven't tuned into the NBA recently but they had Grant Hill
[02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:13.000]  with the vaccines for teens they had the shack and somebody else fill out your
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:17.400]  census form now God only knows what they're using that for then of course
[02:29:17.400 --> 02:29:22.360]  they intermingle they intermingle the military commercials in with all of this
[02:29:22.360 --> 02:29:25.720]  but stay there stay there stay there I want you to start without me interrupting
[02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:29.640]  and see I want to do a news and review show I've said for a decade I'm gonna do
[02:29:29.640 --> 02:29:33.400]  it I finally got the staff and the studio is being built for every day but it's
[02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:37.400]  gonna take money to have the staff doing this grabbing propaganda clips the
[02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:43.160]  messages in TV in movies in sitcoms in dramas then the ads are all brainwashing
[02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:48.040]  just to randomly pick an hour of TV and show people the program and it's
[02:29:48.040 --> 02:29:52.760]  getting worse because they're building up towards something we're on the march
[02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:58.120]  the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:30:00.840 --> 02:30:05.800]  they helped to create a new world order we are part of a new world order a new
[02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:07.480]  world order based upon collective

[02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:15.720]  okay we're going to continue with jeff jake tony mohammed pat and others that are patiently
[02:33:15.720 --> 02:33:20.840]  holding i'm going to get into the attacks on free speech that are happening we're going to
[02:33:20.840 --> 02:33:24.840]  break down congressman in illinois saying i don't worry about the constitution kathryn
[02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:33.720]  austin fits coming up in the next hour but that's why i'm frustrated and i tell you this every day
[02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:38.760]  because i can't watch all the television i can't read all the news i can't even cover
[02:33:39.480 --> 02:33:46.280]  everything that's going on it's so much worse than i say and they're just marinating people in
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:53.880]  propaganda the sitcoms are all anti-family anti homeschool anti people that don't want to be
[02:33:53.880 --> 02:33:59.000]  vaccinated there's ads everywhere for the human papilloma Gardasil shot that admittedly
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:04.120]  he's killed a bunch of people and doesn't even protect you from it there's ads for prozac everywhere
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:10.680]  there's a demonization of gun owners everywhere there's promotion of world government everywhere
[02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:15.160]  there's constant pushing of humans are bad we've got to have the green economy and it's going to
[02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:21.080]  give you jobs when they know it does the opposite and is designed to destroy our industrial capacity
[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:26.840]  on record and that's not even the tip of the iceberg it just goes on and on and on and on
[02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:34.360]  my wife maybe once a week on um you know weeknight or something she'll try to watch a movie or watch
[02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:39.080]  a sitcom and she calls me in and goes look this whole show is about how a woman doesn't give her
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:44.520]  kids vaccine so they die or this whole show is about how great abortions are or this whole show
[02:34:44.520 --> 02:34:50.520]  is about how bad humans are it's it's just everything it's total propaganda and the federal
[02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:55.960]  government spends tens of billions a year per program i haven't added it all up it's got to be
[02:34:55.960 --> 02:35:02.600]  a hundred billion with billboards and tv ads and product placement propaganda placement in the shows
[02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:10.280]  and we are building the tv studio it should be done in a month then it'll take a month to fit
[02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:14.520]  it all out get it all set up with equipment because we're small operation but we your support is
[02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:19.800]  allowed this and then i want to hire one or two of the right people that know how to just go through
[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:25.320]  the youtube clips go through tv pick out some of the shows we want to focus on and show lies on
[02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:32.680]  the nightly news propaganda in ads cash with society propaganda environment propaganda world
[02:35:32.680 --> 02:35:41.800]  government pro uh you know tyranny military ads weird military ads showing martial laws a good
[02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:48.600]  thing local newscast promoting urban warfare takeover drills i mean tv saying mercury's good
[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:55.320]  for kids melamine's good for kids i mean it's unbelievable i mean i can watch any program any
[02:35:55.320 --> 02:36:02.360]  show except for jesse ventura's conspiracy theory and i don't and ventura doesn't know why they allowed
[02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:11.320]  this on air i guess it's like a beta test or something there's nothing on tell it well i mean
[02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:17.960]  every once in a while i'll see an msnbc clip a month ago where they admitted okay 23.7 trillions
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:21.800]  been stolen by the bank so they won't say where it went this is horrible so i guess that's what
[02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:28.680]  ventura show is too they allowed just a few things to keep the illusion of objectivity i
[02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:35.720]  i don't even know what it is um we'll ask ventura about that tomorrow because i know he's a good guy
[02:36:35.720 --> 02:36:42.280]  i'm involved in the show and be even bigger role uh in consulting and on the program coming up in the
[02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:49.080]  next season i look forward more to hanging out with jesse he's such a cool guy and so nice
[02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:54.520]  that i do even being in it i almost don't even want to be in it because the attention and all
[02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:59.880]  the jealousy it creates but all i'm trying to do is wake people up nothing more i mean it's a burden
[02:37:01.320 --> 02:37:05.240]  this knowledge is a burden but it's a greater burden to not stand up against it and know where
[02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:10.600]  this is leading jeff and nevada finish up your point about what you saw just watching a basketball
[02:37:10.600 --> 02:37:18.920]  game last night on tv well alex they've got to basically uh three or four talking points that
[02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:25.480]  mimic what you did the same talking points that you see if you pick up usa today military good
[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:33.640]  cops good uh in particular one that ad caught my eye it shows an older father leaning over
[02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:38.600]  over his computer going gee uh my heart there could be something a little bit more than just
[02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:43.720]  heart trouble i might need this drug and the daughter leans over onto his computer and
[02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:48.520]  real quick types it up and says oh dad your heart could be this this and this you know some new
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:55.320]  disease that they just invented uh to sell this drug so that's another example and then you'll
[02:37:55.320 --> 02:38:02.600]  also notice they'll if there's a basket scored many times they will flash to the troops uh
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:08.680]  watching uh watching this over and it associates at a pablovian level where they ring a bell they
[02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:16.600]  give the dog a piece of steak well they they do it in reverts the dog gets the piece of steak hey
[02:38:16.600 --> 02:38:22.600]  the team just got a basket and then it cuts to the bell so that associates the basket
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:29.640]  with something good which is the troops absolutely i'm when i watch football now
[02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:35.000]  every time that's what they do again it's all everyone's being targeted they admit you're
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:39.400]  being targeted and all i want people to do is become aware i mean look you turn television on
[02:38:39.960 --> 02:38:44.360]  they haven't had about face scanning to buy and sell how great it is the next ad is an idiot guy in
[02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:51.400]  a park with his girlfriend in this pastoral scene it's a red a a red popsicle at a subconscious
[02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:56.440]  level like the garden of eden the woman's feeding him grapes it's this primitive thing of the man
[02:38:56.440 --> 02:39:01.160]  you know brings in the food he's hunted for and the woman you know provides for him this image
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:05.640]  that men want then it's the image that women want of them being over the man and being smarter than
[02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:10.360]  him and he says i heard corn syrup can hurt you and he says she says what's your proof he goes i
[02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:15.320]  don't have any i'm an idiot she goes that's right it's scientifically proven to be wonderful
[02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:21.080]  and then so again it's just all when they admit it give you a destroys your pancreas it gives you
[02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:29.160]  diabetes it doesn't matter because again they have a tv ad because they know the women by 80 plus
[02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:33.800]  percent of the food at the grocery store so that it's targeting women you're smarter than your husband
[02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:39.960]  he's an idiot if he tells you that corn syrup's bad he's a liar bring it to him it will make you
[02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:45.000]  have power now now women you shouldn't be insulted by me telling you how they're propagandizing you
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:51.240]  you should be angry and upset go ahead and finish up your point jeff yes alex there's two things that
[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:57.960]  i would say to pay attention to which which both of which alan watt has talked about periodically
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:03.080]  one that when you're watching these tv programs what they'll try is what you just appointed to
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:08.120]  it's called neuro associative conditioning the pavlovian conditioning they want to get you
[02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:14.120]  they get you as a viewer into a peak state a super bowl uh excuse me a uh a touchdown
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:20.440]  is scored a basket is made at a critical time when your nervous system is in that peak state of
[02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:25.080]  pleasure now they're going to flash military military military now does this mean that every
[02:40:25.080 --> 02:40:29.480]  guy in the military is bad no i'm not saying that but what it does you know but it's military
[02:40:29.480 --> 02:40:34.440]  propaganda scientifically being applied to the public without them knowing about it this is
[02:40:34.440 --> 02:40:40.440]  the essence of mind control sounds like uh you've been in psyops or or are are you a marketing
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:45.960]  psychologist no no no i know nothing like that but you know i've just done a little bit of reading
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:52.440]  and the thing is what's very important is if you listen to your show and listen to the guests that
[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:58.520]  are on your show long enough you start to see a lot of this is predictive programming even even
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:41:03.640]  for example what they did with the a plexigirl group births with his gun case and tiger woods
[02:41:03.640 --> 02:41:10.120]  in in his case what they're telling you in a mode of predictive programming is that
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:14.680]  you have no privacy you know if i was tiger woods i would i would tell people this is
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:19.160]  between me and my wife this is none of your business this is none of your business i mean
[02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:23.480]  if you come out and said at least i don't have underage prostitutes at my house like barney
[02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:28.440]  frank you know shut up but no they got him to play into the guilt and i'm not saying what he did
[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:32.040]  was good the point is none of our business and and then they said oh he screwed up more he's
[02:41:32.040 --> 02:41:37.720]  got to apologize more and it teaches us that we have no privacy another great point teaches it
[02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:43.000]  it teaches it now there was a player from the browns arrested for carrying a handgun didn't
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:49.960]  unload it and it creates the perception that all guns are illegal everywhere at all times
[02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:57.000]  and you'll notice when you turn on the spn they show a very unflattering photograph of the guy
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:01.640]  caught with the gun who he's caught with the gun now i was proud of there's one guy eric
[02:42:01.640 --> 02:42:08.040]  silliest on the spn who actually uh stands up for he stood up for rufflesberg and so the guy
[02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:13.160]  hasn't even been convicted yet we don't even know the facts of the story everybody else on the spn
[02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:19.560]  wanted blood suspend them eliminate him get rid of this guy you don't even know that ties into people
[02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:25.240]  training the public to hate anyone who's successful so they can sick the working class on any middle
[02:42:25.240 --> 02:42:30.520]  class telling them the working class that anyone whose middle class is actually the rich elite
[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:34.600]  so they know the public's mad at the rich elite so they falsely create the perception
[02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:39.960]  that middle class is the elite pressure from above pressure from below to destroy the ancestral
[02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:47.080]  enemy of the elite a middle class merchant class great points jeff i appreciate your call you

[02:44:04.520 --> 02:44:08.680]  jeff's a great caller intelligent the type of caller we want who's informed and active and has
[02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:14.520]  done his research and he did some research and knew all the scientific terms of pablovian
[02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:22.280]  operant conditioning and other systems the and it gave me a headache because it made my mind flashed
[02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:27.320]  with all the other data i had on this and then also made me sick and angry at the establishment
[02:44:27.320 --> 02:44:36.120]  i mean having psychological warfare programming actual brainwashing the same stuff 60 years ago
[02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:41.160]  they'd have on movie screens in the soviet union inside a camp where they were breaking people
[02:44:41.160 --> 02:44:45.640]  i mean i mean to read all over the country where the police come in and take over
[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:51.320]  unannounced elementary schools dressed up in camo and say we're the home schoolers
[02:44:51.320 --> 02:44:57.000]  against public school we're here to kill you and the children defecate they urinate they pass out
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:01.480]  teachers end up going to loony bands they tell them it's real for hours they throw blood on them
[02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:06.200]  they put them on the ground and say i'm gonna blow your head off unannounced in many of the drills
[02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:14.440]  that is a hard core brainwashing operation i mean that is scarring these children
[02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:16.680]  but then they tell the parents well we're worried about malicious
[02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:26.360]  in fact search this one of the worst cases we learned it's happening nationwide but
[02:45:26.360 --> 02:45:29.720]  where people actually complain so we learned about it was about four years ago
[02:45:29.720 --> 02:45:36.120]  and it was in the associated press pull up the term
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:42.360]  it's mentally exhausting doing this i'm not complaining it's just it's it's starting to
[02:45:42.360 --> 02:45:46.360]  weigh on me folks the level of knowledge and if you research you'd have this knowledge too and
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:52.440]  it's just it's just it's like please wake up please see what's happening parents angry over
[02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:58.440]  Michigan security drill

[02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:16.280]  took the elementary kids out the back of school so we're going to kill you in the forest
[02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:22.440]  and i have to sit here and think we're doing that to stop mass shootings we've got a naked

[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:34.760]  but they're training you that this if you naked body scan your kids you'd get in trouble but the
[02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:40.520]  state says they can do it they're training the preachers to tell their flocks to go to fema

[02:48:36.200 --> 02:48:42.440]  frank down to two forty nine sixty eight so the price of the frank is actually lower it gets it down
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:47.080]  to ninety dollars and sixty eight cents after you consider the one hundred and fifty nine
[02:48:47.080 --> 02:48:52.440]  dollar discount for the forecaster subscription totals four hundred and fifty three dollars and
[02:48:52.440 --> 02:48:57.160]  forty cents an ounce for gold i mean we're both looking at gold right now at a thousand thirty
[02:48:57.160 --> 02:49:03.960]  eleven hundred and thirty five dollars an ounce that's a steal we are unbelievable the one ounce

[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:34.680]  one thousand eighty three level and now we're looking at one thousand one hundred and thirty five
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:39.960]  so this is really a good buy and i would suggest that people get involved but really if you haven't

[02:55:56.520 --> 02:56:03.000]  not a game is it and they think of you as a bunch of stupid monkeys they can just program
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:07.880]  but if you're conscious of the program and you can break free from it uh let's talk to uh jake
[02:56:07.880 --> 02:56:12.760]  in wisconsin jake you're on the air hey alex uh how you doing today thanks for having me on
[02:56:13.320 --> 02:56:19.400]  i was calling to see if you have ever read the msds or material safety data sheet on sodium fluoride
[02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:24.200]  yes they say it attacks all the organs it's incredible deadly poison if you get any of it
[02:56:24.200 --> 02:56:29.480]  and you it's horrible it's a cumulative poison so even small exposures over time are incredibly
[02:56:29.480 --> 02:56:34.040]  hazardous and they that's why they put it in the water but i mean tell folks what it says tell
[02:56:34.040 --> 02:56:38.920]  folks what it says uh well uh for those of you who don't know a material safety data sheet
[02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:45.880]  um on a job site or a um warehouse or whatever if you have chemicals you have to have a material
[02:56:45.880 --> 02:56:50.280]  safety data sheet for any chemicals you have on site so the people know what to do with it
[02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:56.120]  but in case they come into contact or a spill happens what have you okay the first part is
[02:56:56.120 --> 02:57:01.720]  relatively benign but when you get to the fourth page section 11 it starts talking about
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:09.400]  toxological information um roots of entry inhalation and indigene ingestion um mutagenic
[02:57:09.400 --> 02:57:17.480]  effects um mutagenic for mammalian somatic cells mutagenic for bacteria um made by the
[02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:23.800]  the the the the the the main mammalian cells are breast tissue and testicular tissue because those
[02:57:23.800 --> 02:57:31.080]  have the highest fluctuation of hormone uh fluctuations and so they target that and if you
[02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:35.640]  read the literature that's why it attacks your reproductive circle go ahead yeah uh they also
[02:57:35.640 --> 02:57:41.560]  have uh page five special mark remarks on toxic effects on humans uh and they have it broken down
[02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:49.240]  by um organ system skin causes skin irritation eyes causes eye irritation and burns um ingestion
[02:57:49.240 --> 02:57:54.600]  harmful is swallowed causes digestive tract irritation and burns may cause severe and permanent
[02:57:54.600 --> 02:58:00.920]  damage to the digestive tract ingestion of large amounts may cause salvation thirst nausea vomiting
[02:58:00.920 --> 02:58:07.320]  hypermollatility diarrhea abdominal pain um behavioral some central nervous system damage
[02:58:07.320 --> 02:58:13.800]  um respiratory damage cardiovascular system damage a liver urinary there is absolutely
[02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:18.600]  nothing here that it doesn't attack it's just terrible and then they put it in our water but
[02:58:18.600 --> 02:58:25.400]  if you spill some at work you'd have to call a hazmat team but we're conspiracy theorists it
[02:58:25.400 --> 02:58:29.560]  doesn't matter if we have russian nazi and u.s. government documents where they said they put
[02:58:29.560 --> 02:58:34.280]  it in the water to sterilize and brain damages but the government's good i'm glad they're running

[03:00:12.840 --> 03:00:17.720]  gather an awesome fit to talk about the economy the police state the new world order the nature of
[03:00:17.720 --> 03:00:25.080]  the elites is coming up the next segment let's go ahead and take some more calls tony and canada
[03:00:25.080 --> 03:00:34.360]  you're on the air hello yes sir hey how are you doing boss all right uh perfect um i just i was
[03:00:34.360 --> 03:00:38.840]  doing a lot of research over the past year because of all the information you guys have been providing
[03:00:38.840 --> 03:00:43.480]  of course everybody's thankful for that we do appreciate it uh but i haven't been hearing a
[03:00:43.480 --> 03:00:49.800]  lot of information about uh security companies like converse technology and the rent and nice
[03:00:49.800 --> 03:00:55.480]  systems as well as noise well they're a revolving door and homeland security and it's the same in
[03:00:55.480 --> 03:01:00.040]  europe where when somebody's at homeland security they give them the contracts and then five years
[03:01:00.040 --> 03:01:05.560]  later they move into that company as an executive absolutely and and one of the biggest issues that
[03:01:05.560 --> 03:01:10.440]  converse is the headquarters is in israel as well as all these other sub companies or umbrella
[03:01:10.440 --> 03:01:15.560]  companies uh like rent and and norris and all these other companies but they have contracts
[03:01:15.560 --> 03:01:22.120]  now with american telecom communication companies and now each and every single telephone across
[03:01:22.120 --> 03:01:26.520]  north america's linked to israeli intelligence through this system because i mean that's been
[03:01:26.520 --> 03:01:33.240]  for 10 years that's been for 10 years absolutely because then they can get around us laws because
[03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:39.640]  a foreign government is doing the spying and then giving it back to the nsa they claim it doesn't get
[03:01:39.640 --> 03:01:44.840]  around the law it just hides the criminality you know exactly exactly and if you do research
[03:01:44.840 --> 03:01:48.920]  for enough at least all the way back down to source fire which the major clients are american
[03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:53.720]  defense department the national security department and then all these people think of them but they
[03:01:53.720 --> 03:01:58.040]  go online and they think that they're safe through these security companies but uh one of the major
[03:01:58.040 --> 03:02:04.040]  um companies that i found that was connected to these things is um very fine now very fine
[03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:09.400]  that deals with most of the majority of the credit card securities uh online and everybody
[03:02:09.400 --> 03:02:14.680]  trust this company but very fine it's it's directly linked to one of its major company
[03:02:14.680 --> 03:02:21.160]  partners is norris systems which also deals with ibm neck it also deals with um pennlink
[03:02:21.160 --> 03:02:26.920]  ltd which provides for every single stage of level of law and the government can raise up the tech
[03:02:26.920 --> 03:02:32.920]  companies they want to be preeminent by giving them the contracts great point tony mohammad in
[03:02:32.920 --> 03:02:40.600]  colorado you're on the air hey so i am i don't know if anybody mentioned this on the friday or
[03:02:40.600 --> 03:02:46.680]  sunday show but i just want to go see uh the new clash of the titans movie yesterday and uh unlike
[03:02:46.680 --> 03:02:52.040]  the 80s show that's all about uh some dude that's sort of left struck and going to fight things
[03:02:52.040 --> 03:02:57.880]  uh this one to me was really almost like an allegory for uh the current state of the u.s. so
[03:02:57.880 --> 03:03:03.720]  in the in the movie you've got uh these titans that are defeated by their sons the the gods and
[03:03:03.720 --> 03:03:08.680]  the gods make uh people human beings to pray to them in order for them to kind of live forever
[03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:14.920]  and uh so the people become very distraught with the tyranny of the titans and and kind of rebel
[03:03:14.920 --> 03:03:19.880]  and so they release this kraken that's uh that's supposed to kind of um put the people back and
[03:03:19.880 --> 03:03:24.120]  check and happily through the movie i immediately thought you know this is kind of like the the
[03:03:24.120 --> 03:03:31.080]  u.s. you've got uh yeah i've been one is the kraken absolutely right release the kraken
[03:03:33.240 --> 03:03:40.040]  you got people who who who fled from from england the tyranny in england you know and then and so
[03:03:40.040 --> 03:03:45.800]  these are represented by the gods and so the gods set up a government they they have for the people
[03:03:45.800 --> 03:03:50.760]  and and you're supposed to pay your taxes to the government and right now in the current
[03:03:50.760 --> 03:03:55.240]  state the government's becoming tyrannical and so people are just kind of taking a fan saying no
[03:03:55.240 --> 03:03:59.720]  no we're not we're not gonna really put up with this tyranny and so the government's like release
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:05.240]  the kraken you know onto the people and so i happily through the movie i really just started
[03:04:05.240 --> 03:04:11.320]  realizing oh this is really almost about america and and about well george lucas said that episode
[03:04:11.320 --> 03:04:17.240]  three revenge of the sith is where the senator becomes the president then the the ruler by staging
[03:04:17.240 --> 03:04:22.520]  terror attacks and outside military attacks on himself and many of the terrorist armies he's
[03:04:22.520 --> 03:04:28.360]  running don't even know that they're not really going to win in the end uh and and lucas said no
[03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:34.120]  no i you know this is what our government really does do he's definitely a 9-11 truther uh so
[03:04:34.120 --> 03:04:38.840]  absolutely that's what's going on yeah so i thought throughout there anybody um that that
[03:04:38.840 --> 03:04:42.360]  was the you know take a moment or leave yourself with some strength was it a good movie overall
[03:04:43.320 --> 03:04:48.200]  overall it's pretty good movie and uh and it's just that that message that allegory is very
[03:04:48.200 --> 03:04:52.040]  overt so it doesn't take a lot of digging to really realize that so it's it's worth checking out
[03:04:52.040 --> 03:04:57.320]  entertaining well i don't watch a lot of films but i may have to go watch it so we do a review
[03:04:57.320 --> 03:05:04.040]  here plus i like escapism occasionally hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite

[03:09:31.240 --> 03:09:37.000]  but i first wanted to go to this business week article fdic wants pension funds to prop up failed
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:44.200]  banks and in fact this isn't the bloomberg this is the uh this is the uh raw story i want the
[03:09:44.200 --> 03:09:48.760]  bloomberg or business week i want to show people that one uh this is basically the same article
[03:09:48.760 --> 03:09:52.040]  i mean here's a link to the bloomberg news because i wanted to read the actual quotes
[03:09:52.040 --> 03:09:56.760]  where they're ordering with this color of law cannot be ordered the banks to take the bailout
[03:09:56.760 --> 03:10:02.600]  wink wink uh to invest public and private pension funds quote in failed banks uh kathryn
[03:10:02.600 --> 03:10:08.680]  awson fits what is all that about well we have seen the pension funds over the last 10 to 20 years
[03:10:09.320 --> 03:10:15.640]  come under significant pressure to invest in a variety of things which have left the pension
[03:10:15.640 --> 03:10:21.560]  funds in real trouble so we have the pension funds the pension fund the american pension funds
[03:10:21.560 --> 03:10:27.240]  were the key vehicle used to finance the the housing bubble and have gotten you know left
[03:10:27.240 --> 03:10:34.280]  holding the bag and so the it is incredibly important now like the pension funds have the
[03:10:34.280 --> 03:10:41.240]  legal protection and authority to finance you know what is the right thing to do and and if
[03:10:41.240 --> 03:10:46.920]  if there's one reform that needs to happen it's a real investigation of why why do the pension
[03:10:46.920 --> 03:10:54.040]  funds keep doing you know the scams and how do you stop that um because it's left you know we
[03:10:54.040 --> 03:10:59.240]  now have state and local governments and companies having to come up with a new big pension fund
[03:10:59.240 --> 03:11:05.480]  payments because there's been too much political interference i described you've heard me tell
[03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:10.040]  the story where the president of the largest pension fund in the country calper said to me
[03:11:10.040 --> 03:11:15.560]  in 1997 when i was trying to interest him in refinancing american communities he said it's too
[03:11:15.560 --> 03:11:19.000]  late you don't understand they've given up on the country they're moving all the money out
[03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:25.240]  starting in the fall you know and my question is you know well who's they and how can they order
[03:11:25.240 --> 03:11:32.680]  you as a pension fund board to just you know do things with your money and and the reality is
[03:11:33.240 --> 03:11:39.800]  if if if calper has had invested in the fundamental infrastructure and well being of american
[03:11:39.800 --> 03:11:45.400]  communities and and the american infrastructure they would have lost a lot less money you know
[03:11:45.400 --> 03:11:49.640]  that you know instead of losing on the pump and dump and we would have an infrastructure
[03:11:49.640 --> 03:11:55.880]  and a nation but this is predatory and again you were there at the top of the pyramid watching this
[03:11:55.880 --> 03:12:01.880]  happened trying to stop it on record right even at the time so to be clear we have the head
[03:12:01.880 --> 03:12:07.000]  nasa climatologist we have the u n we have all these world leaders bill gates saying they want
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:13.080]  to destroy industrial society so they get you in debt get your local governments pension funds
[03:12:13.080 --> 03:12:18.840]  police fire you name it to invest they move it all offshore right then the country implodes and
[03:12:18.840 --> 03:12:22.920]  then they come in with even more debt right and they come in they take over health care then they
[03:12:22.920 --> 03:12:27.080]  run your life go ahead right so then they say your pension funds have lost all this money now
[03:12:27.080 --> 03:12:31.880]  what's the fdic up to the the last person who should be telling the pension funds what they
[03:12:31.880 --> 03:12:38.920]  should invest in is the fdic now i say that and alex what you need to know is uh you know the
[03:12:38.920 --> 03:12:44.280]  patterns appear that lots of small banks are being targeted in a way that's ending up providing
[03:12:44.280 --> 03:12:50.680]  subsidy to the people who pick them up in other words we have a double standard in enforcement
[03:12:50.680 --> 03:12:56.280]  by the banking regulators so the big banks get who've been doing all the improper things get
[03:12:56.280 --> 03:13:01.560]  bailed out and the small banks who've been well managed are getting targeted and and taken over
[03:13:01.560 --> 03:13:07.480]  in a way that subsidized the big banks so you have to be careful behind here you know that we
[03:13:07.480 --> 03:13:13.640]  don't see the fdic driving the small banks into pension funds in a way that is part of an economic
[03:13:13.640 --> 03:13:18.440]  warfare game and my fear is you know the next thing you know you see state and local government
[03:13:18.440 --> 03:13:24.120]  pension funds financing someone like saurus or the big hedge fund operators picking up these small
[03:13:24.120 --> 03:13:30.280]  banks for cheap absolutely so that's why i brought this article up first and i want you to spend
[03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:35.640]  some more time on this before we get into some other related issues because here they are in
[03:13:35.640 --> 03:13:42.520]  business week in bloomberg uh saying and and and obama's people are now out there pushing this
[03:13:42.520 --> 03:13:48.520]  that oh we're going to just take your pension funds wholesale to protect them and then of course
[03:13:48.520 --> 03:13:53.000]  they'll invest those into derivatives again then they'll take a large portion of it down the road
[03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:57.960]  get people more dependent on government well we did take most of it but you know you know you've
[03:13:57.960 --> 03:14:04.520]  got to stick with us or you won't get any of it it's this scam artist trap question should capital
[03:14:04.520 --> 03:14:09.880]  be allocated according to one the preferences of the people who are either responsible own
[03:14:09.880 --> 03:14:15.800]  it or control it to according to economic performance i.e. you know what's the best
[03:14:15.800 --> 03:14:22.120]  investment or three should it be channeled according to government dictates to a few
[03:14:22.120 --> 03:14:28.680]  small investors that allow them to control and own everything well let me stop you again exactly
[03:14:28.680 --> 03:14:35.720]  it sounds good that in the banking bill the government is now officially in the banking
[03:14:35.720 --> 03:14:41.800]  business slipped into it was a student loan legislation where the government will now
[03:14:41.800 --> 03:14:47.880]  be the person loaning but really it'll be the government directing you to specific top three
[03:14:47.880 --> 03:14:53.560]  or four banks so this is a vertical integration and i want to be clear here for new listeners
[03:14:53.560 --> 03:14:59.880]  the government controls the regulators they can arrest or set up or shut down or sanction
[03:15:00.440 --> 03:15:04.760]  any pension fund manager that doesn't do what they're told and here they are in bloomberg
[03:15:04.760 --> 03:15:12.360]  openly telling the federal government run by private banks at the top telling the pension
[03:15:12.360 --> 03:15:19.720]  fund controllers you will invest with us quote in failed banks so this is the government completely
[03:15:19.720 --> 03:15:26.520]  taking over society break down how serious this is the soviet union but here's what you've got
[03:15:26.520 --> 03:15:35.000]  let's say your neighbor alex is an insider and you are an outsider and and your your insider
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:38.440]  neighborhood plays ball with the government and the government says you know something
[03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:43.320]  you can finance your car for zero percent which is what hedge fund operators have been doing
[03:15:43.320 --> 03:15:47.720]  they've been on the carry trade they've been borrowing for zero to one percent and and your
[03:15:47.720 --> 03:15:52.360]  neighbor can finance his car with zero percent financing he can finance his mortgage with
[03:15:52.360 --> 03:15:57.720]  zero percent financing and we're going to provide financing to his we're going to provide equity
[03:15:57.720 --> 03:16:04.200]  financing to his business for two percent meantime you have to pay five percent for your car financing
[03:16:04.200 --> 03:16:08.760]  six percent for your mortgage financing and by the way you can't get equity for your business
[03:16:08.760 --> 03:16:13.800]  but you can borrow at the bank for twelve percent if you can get somebody to guarantee you okay now
[03:16:13.800 --> 03:16:19.480]  how long is it going to take before your neighbor has you know a much bigger car a much bigger house
[03:16:19.480 --> 03:16:27.000]  and has bought your business you know that went bankrupt and if you and we're talking about controlling
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:34.120]  through the back door by controlling the cost of capital and certain players get a very low or
[03:16:34.120 --> 03:16:39.080]  even free or negative cost of capital so i'm a bank every time i lose i'm a big bank every time i
[03:16:39.080 --> 03:16:46.200]  lose money you just replenish what i lost whereas the rest of us have real risk and and we have to
[03:16:46.200 --> 03:16:52.440]  pay a much higher cost of capital than we would if we could just you know if there was a real market
[03:16:53.880 --> 03:17:00.440]  and if you won't sell your business to them they put in the green economy which is run
[03:17:00.440 --> 03:17:05.800]  by government they will selectively force you to sell your business or they will shut you down
[03:17:05.800 --> 03:17:11.640]  well there's thousands of ways it happens but but there's a double standard in terms of regulatory
[03:17:11.640 --> 03:17:16.520]  enforcement so for example you know i used to have a broker dealer that was a small company
[03:17:17.160 --> 03:17:23.000]  and uh before i'd worked on wall street and if you look at the enforcement cost and time that we
[03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:29.240]  spent as a small business it was significantly greater um you know but but but there are double
[03:17:29.240 --> 03:17:37.160]  standards now let let me describe behind this what one of the legitimate problems is um
[03:17:37.880 --> 03:17:44.840]  we have a real problem in that right now the financial markets have two goals you know the
[03:17:44.840 --> 03:17:49.720]  goal you're taught in business school is the goal of the financial markets is to allocate capital
[03:17:49.720 --> 03:17:55.800]  to the most efficient players and so you know some companies are efficient and and they make money
[03:17:55.800 --> 03:18:01.160]  and so they attract your you buy their stock as opposed to the big bank that has a derivative
[03:18:01.160 --> 03:18:06.760]  mess and goes bankrupt right so so one is the allocation of capital the other increasingly
[03:18:06.760 --> 03:18:13.640]  alex is geopolitical economic warfare you know we've gone from a planet where wars occur with
[03:18:13.640 --> 03:18:20.440]  with bombs to where wars occur with derivative bombs and and you're literally seeing a chief
[03:18:20.440 --> 03:18:27.000]  chief sort of a geopolitical competition between the chinese the russians and populations around
[03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:32.760]  the globe for resources through the capital markets and so the the national security goals
[03:18:33.320 --> 03:18:37.240]  of manipulating the futures market at the price of oil or the price of gold
[03:18:37.800 --> 03:18:45.080]  have have literally overtaken um you know the goal of using the markets for whatever and
[03:18:45.080 --> 03:18:47.960]  and part of what you're seeing with all the goal of the capital control
[03:18:47.960 --> 03:18:54.040]  is is literally if you're the government you can't afford for people to be making a free market
[03:18:54.680 --> 03:18:58.440]  you need every you know you need the 20 mules to go in this direction because that's what
[03:18:58.440 --> 03:19:04.200]  you need to like manage the chinese and so you have this incredible desire for control
[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:08.840]  including for a legitimate reason and let me tell you what the problem is you and i have
[03:19:08.840 --> 03:19:15.160]  talked many times about the red button problem which is everybody in america right now we are
[03:19:15.160 --> 03:19:23.320]  all the beneficiary of this this geopolitical effort so tomorrow if the geopolitics stopped
[03:19:23.880 --> 03:19:29.400]  and america stopped playing to win at geopolitics and we stopped being the global leader in money
[03:19:29.400 --> 03:19:34.680]  laundering and we stopped you know stealing from people using derivatives what would happen is
[03:19:34.680 --> 03:19:39.800]  everybody's government subsidy check would stop and as of last month americans get more
[03:19:39.800 --> 03:19:43.880]  government checks we get more money from the government than we send to the government tax
[03:19:43.880 --> 03:19:48.840]  yeah i saw that in the new york times stay there and and again i've been interrupting a few times
[03:19:48.840 --> 03:19:55.960]  because it's so incredible to see them openly saying they're going to take over the pension funds
[03:19:56.600 --> 03:20:02.120]  we're going to break down where this is going when we come back stay with us times are tough

[03:24:10.440 --> 03:24:15.480]  the information she just laid on us and expand on it they get you dependent on government they
[03:24:15.480 --> 03:24:20.040]  take your pension funds your investment your tax money for the infrastructure they put it in
[03:24:20.040 --> 03:24:25.320]  offshore banks and derivatives that bankrupts people by design then they come back and say we need
[03:24:25.320 --> 03:24:30.920]  even more money and more taxes to prop all this up when you hear it's for the geopolitical purposes
[03:24:30.920 --> 03:24:36.520]  of the us in england europe that's the private banking arms they're feeding on us but they get us
[03:24:37.160 --> 03:24:42.360]  tied into their system where we can't live with it or without it and now it's coming
[03:24:42.360 --> 03:24:47.400]  towards the consolidation phase they're going to use phony environmentalism to bring in a form of
[03:24:47.400 --> 03:24:54.840]  neo serfdom or feudalism to control our lives and now they're showing their true hand ordering
[03:24:54.840 --> 03:25:02.520]  the pension funds to give their money to the private banks and katherine austin fitz is a short
[03:25:02.520 --> 03:25:12.680]  segment but please elaborate on the point that you were making oh now alex you got me i just
[03:25:12.680 --> 03:25:19.880]  finished making the point about the red button and and the extent to which we are financially dependent
[03:25:19.880 --> 03:25:26.360]  on global warfare so we're implementing warfare globally whether with military warfare with
[03:25:26.920 --> 03:25:33.080]  covert opera operations warfare or increasingly now with this financial warfare and the reality
[03:25:33.080 --> 03:25:39.880]  as a system is most americans are the financial beneficiary of this sort of geopolitical warfare
[03:25:39.880 --> 03:25:44.920]  and the fact that our currency is very subsidized and the red button story is a story i tell where
[03:25:44.920 --> 03:25:50.280]  i ask an audience of people who will push the red button if it'll stop all hard narcotics traffic
[03:25:50.280 --> 03:25:56.840]  in their community tomorrow and out of an audience of 100 spiritually committed people to evolving
[03:25:56.840 --> 03:26:02.520]  our society spiritually 99 said they would not push the red button because they don't want their
[03:26:02.520 --> 03:26:07.960]  mutual funds to go down or the government checks to stop so we now have an entire society which
[03:26:07.960 --> 03:26:14.280]  is financially complicit in this warfare model and so the question for all of us is you know
[03:26:14.280 --> 03:26:20.760]  nobody wants the top guys to push the red button because they're afraid and as long as we're afraid
[03:26:20.760 --> 03:26:26.120]  to push the red button or to or to engage in a conversation about it you know okay how do we
[03:26:26.120 --> 03:26:31.240]  turn it green how do we make it financially attractive then what happens as we go along and
[03:26:31.240 --> 03:26:37.400]  and i can say it today you know that they are doing this but the reality is alex that we are
[03:26:37.400 --> 03:26:43.400]  supporting them if you look at the implementation of all of the sort of police state things those
[03:26:43.400 --> 03:26:48.440]  things are being supported at the local level i mean i've watched all these things get implemented
[03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:53.720]  time after time after time and it's you know there's always a group of local people who are
[03:26:53.720 --> 03:26:59.320]  helping promote it it's frightening and so you know but they're doing it because it makes the money
[03:27:01.960 --> 03:27:08.440]  but to boil it down we're coming to the end the banks know they've pumped up the ponzi scheme to
[03:27:08.440 --> 03:27:13.880]  such a level that they're now preparing to rob whatever wealth we've got left and you talked
[03:27:13.880 --> 03:27:19.640]  about how the elites for the last decade have been leaving the united states and now they're not
[03:27:19.640 --> 03:27:25.880]  coming to the end because if you look at the wealth that this planet can can heart you know create
[03:27:25.880 --> 03:27:31.720]  and harvest the amount of wealth that's been created and can be harvest to date is tiny compared
[03:27:31.720 --> 03:27:38.280]  to what you could do in the next 20 or 30 years so so they've just you know this is far we're on
[03:27:38.280 --> 03:27:43.960]  a journey and and the wealth that can be created is far more than exist to date or have well Catherine
[03:27:43.960 --> 03:27:49.240]  you misunderstand hold on you misunderstand what i'm saying okay they are artificially cutting the
[03:27:49.240 --> 03:27:55.160]  avenues of wealth off to independent groups and smaller organizations and vertically integrating
[03:27:55.160 --> 03:28:01.880]  it and saying they want to cut wealth generation off to people in the west i know they got us addicted
[03:28:01.880 --> 03:28:07.480]  in right in north america their attitude is listen if y'all just hit up sit down shut up
[03:28:07.480 --> 03:28:12.200]  you know we put any plan on you and you live on six hundred dollars of government subsidy a month
[03:28:12.200 --> 03:28:16.760]  it'll make it much easier for us to manage the planet you've created a huge amount of wealth we
[03:28:16.760 --> 03:28:20.760]  just stole it all you're gonna be real unhappy about that so we just want you to sit in the
[03:28:20.760 --> 03:28:28.040]  corner and shut up because you know we're on to the next thing bye and what is the next thing
[03:28:28.040 --> 03:28:33.560]  what is the next thing well the next thing is they go to a global economy in a global government
[03:28:33.560 --> 03:28:38.040]  in other words the people managing this in the united states don't see themselves as americans
[03:28:38.040 --> 03:28:46.040]  anymore they see themselves as globalists and and they're managing to a global operation and in fact
[03:28:46.040 --> 03:28:51.160]  if you look at where their big investments are their big investments are in space so in fact you
[03:28:51.160 --> 03:28:56.840]  know they're not necessarily even looking at at planet earth is as the hundred percent base of
[03:28:56.840 --> 03:29:04.920]  operations but but but they have fantastic new technology and and they have a global framework
[03:29:05.480 --> 03:29:10.600]  and and you know their attitude is we've moved on your left behind and the question is how to
[03:29:10.600 --> 03:29:17.160]  manage the in game i agree now when we come back with catherine austin fits i want you to elaborate
[03:29:17.160 --> 03:29:21.560]  on what their in game is and we were talking during the last break you were saying there are

[03:33:16.120 --> 03:33:19.320]  their mindset how they control the planet where they're going
[03:33:22.920 --> 03:33:27.400]  again kathryn awesom fits is a former assistant secretary of housing federal housing commissioner
[03:33:27.400 --> 03:33:35.400]  under bush one the website is salari dot com s o l a r i dot com excellent info up there
[03:33:37.080 --> 03:33:40.040]  okay i'm gonna try to just sit back and give you the floor because i want you to give people
[03:33:40.040 --> 03:33:45.560]  the overview of who we're dealing with what their in-game is what the next phase of their operations
[03:33:45.560 --> 03:33:51.240]  is going to be and how we stop them how we get out of this trap of being dependent on them you
[03:33:51.240 --> 03:33:56.600]  notice all they ever want to do is get us more dependent so that there's basically no way to
[03:33:56.600 --> 03:34:04.200]  get away from these people right well as to come you know that just a big series of about a thousand
[03:34:04.200 --> 03:34:08.760]  questions but let me just start because i think i used to have a pastor in washington who used to
[03:34:08.760 --> 03:34:14.920]  say if we can face it god can fix it and and a lot of the solutions accelerate alex the day that
[03:34:14.920 --> 03:34:21.800]  everyone sits back and says you know these guys are as nuts as alex jones says they are because
[03:34:21.800 --> 03:34:27.320]  all this stuff about slavery and police state you know those are reasonable words that is where
[03:34:27.320 --> 03:34:32.920]  they're going and you know i say this is a former regulator a former assistant secretary of housing
[03:34:32.920 --> 03:34:38.840]  a former board member of a wall street firm a former board member of sally may the student loan
[03:34:38.840 --> 03:34:44.840]  finance organization and let me tell you what how i came to that conclusion and in um you know my
[03:34:44.840 --> 03:34:51.640]  part of my background is doing portfolio strategy for big you know i was the fHA commissioner so
[03:34:51.640 --> 03:34:57.320]  doing portfolio strategy for 300 billion dollars of liabilities and then my company in washington
[03:34:57.320 --> 03:35:04.120]  the hamilton securities group built databases of all you know sort of community assets and real
[03:35:04.120 --> 03:35:09.960]  estate which is looking at the entire g&p and then when we compared it to certain things in
[03:35:09.960 --> 03:35:15.160]  the securities and global markets you're talking about the g&p of the planet so i'm used to dealing
[03:35:15.160 --> 03:35:22.120]  in very large numbers and and actuarial analysis so you know and actuarially analysis says well if
[03:35:22.120 --> 03:35:27.080]  you stop feeding people gmo food they're going to live longer that means insurance companies
[03:35:27.080 --> 03:35:31.240]  are going to have to pay out this much more you know et cetera et cetera et cetera so so you're
[03:35:31.240 --> 03:35:36.360]  used to dealing in very big numbers in the butterfly effect of of changes in policy
[03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:43.080]  with changes in life span so i i give that as a background and i wrote this in the article i wrote
[03:35:43.080 --> 03:35:51.000]  i wrote an essay about why i i was opposed to the swine flu vaccination and i literally when i saw
[03:35:51.000 --> 03:35:56.520]  the policies that were being implemented in connection with the rollout of the wto and the
[03:35:56.520 --> 03:36:03.720]  control of agribusiness worldwide um the rounding up of innocent people and in american communities
[03:36:03.720 --> 03:36:07.960]  and stuffed into prison in the private prison property you know i went through all the different
[03:36:07.960 --> 03:36:14.120]  trends from 96 to 98 and i came to the conclusion sort of back of the envelope that the the only
[03:36:14.120 --> 03:36:20.760]  thing i could conclude was that is that the leadership as a policy was planning on very
[03:36:20.760 --> 03:36:28.600]  significant depopulation worldwide that was the only way i could explain you know the 20 policies
[03:36:28.600 --> 03:36:33.960]  i was seeing being implemented both here and globally with the wto particularly the control
[03:36:33.960 --> 03:36:40.120]  of the food supply and system with the with sort of what mensanto is doing in genetically modified
[03:36:40.120 --> 03:36:45.720]  food and i was very quiet about it at the time you know because i knew other people couldn't fathom
[03:36:45.720 --> 03:36:54.920]  what i was saying and i remember in 1998 or 99 uh very very savvy portfolio strategist from the
[03:36:54.920 --> 03:36:59.880]  financial community called me up and said can you have lunch with me i'm going to be in washington
[03:36:59.880 --> 03:37:04.920]  and we went to lunch at union station and he looked at me and he said you know he said i i know this
[03:37:04.920 --> 03:37:09.720]  is going to sound crazy but i've done the analysis and if you look at the changes and policies that
[03:37:09.720 --> 03:37:14.120]  are being rolled out over the last four years the only thing i can conclude is they're planning
[03:37:14.120 --> 03:37:19.800]  on significant depopulation and i said well that's what my analysis shows and we just kind of
[03:37:19.800 --> 03:37:27.000]  scared at each other and and if you look across the board at what is being done in terms of
[03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:36.040]  building databases on american citizens what is being done with rfi uh uh you know rfi d or
[03:37:36.040 --> 03:37:41.480]  art is it rfi d or rfdi well they've got a bunch of different ones but let me just stop you for a
[03:37:41.480 --> 03:37:48.360]  moment okay because you did it was this huge actuary analyst running hundreds of millions of dollars
[03:37:48.360 --> 03:37:55.560]  you saw it like if somebody sees a guy pull up in a van and start casing a house and then check in
[03:37:55.560 --> 03:38:01.240]  the front door you think maybe they're about to try to rob us i have been at the guy's house
[03:38:01.880 --> 03:38:08.280]  as a fly on the wall and heard him talk about how he's going to rob and so separately and of course
[03:38:08.280 --> 03:38:13.080]  you know all this now it turns out for 50 years they've been planning this and building a world
[03:38:13.080 --> 03:38:18.680]  government as a means to an end and all of the tracking all of the surveillance all the police
[03:38:18.680 --> 03:38:23.960]  state all the mind control the conditioning is to be rolled out in phases and we're now coming into
[03:38:23.960 --> 03:38:30.680]  the end game you're coming in to literally kill 80 percent of people how do we stop this and and
[03:38:30.680 --> 03:38:35.080]  again in the phases they shut the resources off so then you become dependent on government
[03:38:35.080 --> 03:38:41.080]  so it has you in its kill grid the drug the cancer viruses and the shots the mercury i mean
[03:38:41.080 --> 03:38:45.960]  it's all happening i'm sorry go ahead well the food is poisoning us the vaccines are poisoning
[03:38:45.960 --> 03:38:51.960]  so on and on and on here's here's the thing to understand theoretically there is a way to stop
[03:38:51.960 --> 03:38:58.200]  them there really is a way to stop them because uh and it's what the poet said we are we are many
[03:38:58.200 --> 03:39:05.880]  they are few and the reality is when when will you get a critical mass of people facing what's
[03:39:05.880 --> 03:39:12.520]  really going on and then when you hit that tipping point what can they do now step one is you know
[03:39:12.520 --> 03:39:17.320]  the key thing to understand what everybody has to do is we have to do what gives us energy so
[03:39:17.880 --> 03:39:22.280]  um you know what we all can't do is get in the bus and go to washington today you know there
[03:39:22.280 --> 03:39:26.360]  there are many ideas of what we can do that waste a huge amount of our time and effort
[03:39:26.360 --> 03:39:31.320]  that we don't have but step number one you can do and it's one that will give you a lot of energy
[03:39:31.320 --> 03:39:36.760]  if you sequence it right it get as far away from them as you you possibly can or the people who
[03:39:36.760 --> 03:39:42.840]  implement their wishes in your so get out of the big cities i say number one get to know your
[03:39:42.840 --> 03:39:47.800]  neighbors stop watching as much television get healthy purifier water but more importantly
[03:39:47.800 --> 03:39:52.360]  recognize them as the enemy don't just believe pather and austin fits don't just believe alex
[03:39:52.360 --> 03:39:57.000]  jones find out we're telling you the truth and this is life and death and then the ballgame
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:01.480]  isn't going to matter so much and take all your energies and stop seeing kathryn austin fits as
[03:40:01.480 --> 03:40:06.440]  your champion i stop seeing alex jones as your champion you know she's not jonah varkin i'm not
[03:40:06.440 --> 03:40:12.520]  going to watch a champion you're on the uh you know it's really funny and when you withdraw from
[03:40:12.520 --> 03:40:17.480]  the all your ideas are great but but you want to get it financially not dependent on them as
[03:40:17.480 --> 03:40:22.520]  possible to get as far away as you can from government money or money that they control
[03:40:23.160 --> 03:40:28.520]  one of the things that uh that is just a profoundly important thing if everybody
[03:40:28.520 --> 03:40:34.600]  tomorrow in the country alex said you know any bank that's trading derivatives or got
[03:40:34.600 --> 03:40:38.760]  you know big or any of the big banks who got bailout money i'm getting as far away from as i can
[03:40:39.480 --> 03:40:45.080]  so if you pulled your money out of the um out of the big banks and went to a well managed
[03:40:45.080 --> 03:40:51.480]  local bank tomorrow it would have a profound and traumatic impact now you can say well all those
[03:40:51.480 --> 03:40:56.520]  banks channel money into wall street anyway if i'm the federal reserve and i have to negotiate
[03:40:56.520 --> 03:41:02.040]  with 25 000 bank presidents as opposed to 10 it's a very different picture it's a very different
[03:41:02.040 --> 03:41:09.240]  world okay so anything you can do is it's real funny i have a a member of my network who's uh
[03:41:09.240 --> 03:41:15.640]  jewish whose family was really hurt in the holocaust and he was asking me whether or not he should
[03:41:15.640 --> 03:41:20.280]  bank at a big bank and i said you know you're basically asking me whether you should you
[03:41:20.280 --> 03:41:25.400]  should put your money with him or money management or not now why are you asking me that question
[03:41:25.400 --> 03:41:32.440]  don't you know that but that's what we're doing we're financing if you look at any activist group
[03:41:32.440 --> 03:41:38.520]  who's opposed to any of the things they say they let's say the guys are posted gmo well if you
[03:41:38.520 --> 03:41:43.400]  look at where their money is they're all financing the creation of gmo's and the building of that
[03:41:43.400 --> 03:41:48.200]  infrastructure when you finance the u.s government you're financing genetically modified seed
[03:41:48.840 --> 03:41:54.360]  you're financing the implementation of that so so part of it is you know withdraw as much as you
[03:41:54.360 --> 03:41:59.720]  can your person your family your how you spend your time don't be financially dependent but
[03:41:59.720 --> 03:42:09.320]  stop financing the very things that are killing you and your family absolutely now other solutions
[03:42:10.680 --> 03:42:14.280]  and i jumped in there when you said get as far away as you can for the money here's the next
[03:42:14.280 --> 03:42:23.080]  solution who are you supporting for sheriff this this in this local election okay if 3100 counties
[03:42:23.080 --> 03:42:30.120]  the sheriff there's dual sovereignty under the constitution so so your sheriff can literally
[03:42:30.120 --> 03:42:36.760]  tell the federal government to get off you know your county property and know they may not enforce
[03:42:36.760 --> 03:42:42.520]  something that is outside the tenth amendment okay so so we're coming into election the election
[03:42:42.520 --> 03:42:47.320]  cycle and the election cycle is always a time alex when you can be talking to your neighbors about
[03:42:47.320 --> 03:42:52.360]  all these issues and let me tell you something the fact that the bailouts and health care passed
[03:42:52.360 --> 03:42:58.760]  without having any kind of popular sufficient popular support for a change of that extraordinary
[03:42:58.760 --> 03:43:04.440]  nature has got people worked up and they're ready to have a conversation so so number one you want
[03:43:04.440 --> 03:43:09.880]  to get into office the right kind of sheriff and you want your sheriff is your sheriff out there
[03:43:09.880 --> 03:43:16.280]  doing crime patrol or is your sheriff instead spending all of your tax money for closing on
[03:43:16.280 --> 03:43:20.760]  people on behalf of the big bank and trying to squeeze people and raise revenue we've always
[03:43:20.760 --> 03:43:26.440]  promoted patriot sheriffs so we're on the same page right on that front thing is in your state
[03:43:26.440 --> 03:43:31.800]  local areas you have candidates who are who are proposing tenth amendment legislation
[03:43:32.360 --> 03:43:38.520]  so for example Idaho passed the health freedom act we have lots of states trying to pass health
[03:43:38.520 --> 03:43:44.680]  freedom act we have lots of states um uh you know doing a variety of things on the tenth
[03:43:44.680 --> 03:43:49.640]  amendment there's a great tenth amendment center online so you want to find out where the state
[03:43:49.640 --> 03:43:54.120]  and local representatives who are active on tenth amendment and you want to get hooked up
[03:43:54.120 --> 03:44:00.440]  and supporting them okay but the number one message here is get up don't just count on
[03:44:00.440 --> 03:44:03.880]  other people to do it now i want to get into some other issues if we talk about some more
[03:44:03.880 --> 03:44:10.200]  solutions here but also talk about what their in game is studying these larger okay so can i
[03:44:10.200 --> 03:44:17.240]  mention one other thing go ahead stop giving them your data there's an edwin black if you've
[03:44:17.240 --> 03:44:22.920]  ever had edwin black on yes black wrote the book about ibm building the database and computer
[03:44:22.920 --> 03:44:30.440]  systems for the holocaust yes okay well any any kind of police state or any kind of slavery
[03:44:30.440 --> 03:44:37.640]  depends seriously on having the infrastructure you need the database and and computer infrastructure
[03:44:37.640 --> 03:44:43.800]  you need to manage large population so it's just like if you're a farmer and you have livestock
[03:44:43.800 --> 03:44:47.800]  you need great data and great databases if you're going to manage the population
[03:44:48.680 --> 03:44:53.320]  ditto here and what we're watching in the health care bill in a variety of different
[03:44:53.320 --> 03:44:59.400]  legislations and policies and now with the census is the effort to build the definitive
[03:44:59.400 --> 03:45:06.040]  database infrastructure um that will allow them to define where you live who you live with
[03:45:06.600 --> 03:45:12.840]  connect up your health care databases connect up your tax information if they want to connect
[03:45:12.840 --> 03:45:18.360]  up all sorts of private commercial information they have about your spending habits use argument
[03:45:18.360 --> 03:45:22.760]  that's what this bill does it says the irs looks at the health care you're getting can take money
[03:45:22.760 --> 03:45:27.880]  out of your savings account medical savings account uh you were talking about how they're
[03:45:27.880 --> 03:45:32.040]  putting in new laws to track all your money or not let you get your money out of the country
[03:45:32.040 --> 03:45:35.720]  the elites already pulled their money out now they want to make sure the middle class has to
[03:45:35.720 --> 03:45:40.440]  stay here and basically be sucked dry right so what you want to do the first thing you want to
[03:45:40.440 --> 03:45:45.560]  do is you want to get your data out of the system stop giving them data okay and and there
[03:45:45.560 --> 03:45:49.640]  there are lots of different ways you can do that and then the second thing you want to do is you
[03:45:49.640 --> 03:45:55.320]  want to get out of the money system as much as possible anyway so so anything you can do to
[03:45:55.320 --> 03:46:02.280]  protect to not make yourself a target you know we can we can put our money in the stock get a
[03:46:02.280 --> 03:46:07.400]  dividend and then go buy water from the water company but also if we live in a rural area we
[03:46:07.400 --> 03:46:12.120]  can just stop being in the middle and we can go out and build a well and then i don't need your
[03:46:12.120 --> 03:46:16.760]  stock and i don't need your dividend and that's why they're moving nationwide and worldwide to block
[03:46:16.760 --> 03:46:21.720]  people drilling their own wells well that's what so you want to be you if you can you want to live
[03:46:21.720 --> 03:46:25.960]  in an area where you still have the power to do that okay we're running out of time and it's clear
[03:46:25.960 --> 03:46:31.400]  i've got to have you back up for a full hour just on solutions uh those are all great solutions i
[03:46:31.400 --> 03:46:37.880]  number one say wake people up they're ready to be woken up to the full horror but looking at their
[03:46:37.880 --> 03:46:43.880]  program and and being able to factor in all these different elements uh on a wide spectrum analysis
[03:46:43.880 --> 03:46:48.280]  what do you see as their game plan in the next six months to a year to two years
[03:46:48.280 --> 03:46:53.320]  out to five years how do you see them unrolling this global financial takeover and then we'll
[03:46:53.320 --> 03:46:59.400]  dovetail that with this war making economy that isn't just launching wars overseas naked body
[03:46:59.400 --> 03:47:06.440]  scanner surveillance face scanners cps dinecore out grabbing more children for no reason the texas
[03:47:06.440 --> 03:47:10.600]  case where they're taking people's kids now if their parents say don't trust the government i mean
[03:47:10.600 --> 03:47:15.960]  it's getting crazy right no it's well it's it's been crazy for a long time but it's going to become
[03:47:15.960 --> 03:47:21.880]  very crazy to most people and and i think what you need to do is first and foremost you need to know
[03:47:22.600 --> 03:47:28.840]  that that if you are awake and out to protect yourself they can't do this and so the question
[03:47:28.840 --> 03:47:35.400]  is what the step number one everybody has to do is turn off their tv and stop listening to their
[03:47:35.400 --> 03:47:40.680]  media and stay linked into media that's telling you the truth that's step number one because
[03:47:40.680 --> 03:47:45.720]  the first way they control you alexis with your mind so the first step is get your mind clean
[03:47:45.720 --> 03:47:55.240]  don't let them control your mind well i mean how can a cop take a family's child and put on the cps
[03:47:55.240 --> 03:48:00.520]  form they taught their children not to trust the government i mean that's right out of 1984
[03:48:00.520 --> 03:48:06.040]  and these cops feel good while they're doing this i mean these are tyrants i've seen this
[03:48:06.040 --> 03:48:11.960]  in my own situation when i was targeted every team we had 18 audits and investigations of the
[03:48:11.960 --> 03:48:16.840]  hamilton securities group and when it when each one started the people coming into audit
[03:48:16.840 --> 03:48:21.640]  investigate thought we were you know just bad horrible people and then we'd work with them
[03:48:21.640 --> 03:48:27.640]  and before it was over they'd be on our side against the government but but initially they
[03:48:27.640 --> 03:48:32.440]  they are taught to believe that you're bad people and and the problem is most people get defensive
[03:48:33.160 --> 03:48:37.720]  and don't work through it we were trained in spiritual warfare so we saw it as our job to
[03:48:37.720 --> 03:48:43.800]  bring them across to the light and usually dead and so um you know they really don't know and
[03:48:43.800 --> 03:48:49.880]  it's hard alex for you to fathom that the system is that ugly or that evil they really don't know
[03:48:49.880 --> 03:48:56.440]  many of them so we got it we got to turn them around when you saw our article last friday cops
[03:48:56.440 --> 03:49:01.880]  and cps seized child from parents for mistrusting government i was aware of this but you sent me
[03:49:01.880 --> 03:49:05.720]  a lot of stuff that i actually wasn't aware of uh that and we're gonna be showing people some
[03:49:05.720 --> 03:49:12.840]  document cam shots right now uh with uh dinecore heavily involved globally it's been congressional
[03:49:12.840 --> 03:49:19.400]  hearings in in white slavery child kidnapping rings they now have a new name uh but uh csc
[03:49:19.400 --> 03:49:23.960]  dinecore in the economics csc and then they got spun off and went public so they're back to their
[03:49:23.960 --> 03:49:30.520]  old name okay so but but i mean i have all the mainstream news articles this is literally a
[03:49:30.520 --> 03:49:35.720]  legion of doom and that's all part of their military operation and grabbing kids is very lucrative
[03:49:35.720 --> 03:49:40.840]  well the scariest story in the world and one that's hard for most people get into is the role of
[03:49:40.840 --> 03:49:48.600]  pedophilia and pedophilia is a very old story alex it's been used for years you know as a both of
[03:49:48.600 --> 03:49:54.680]  uh you know a personnel benefit if you will and in a form of entrapment once you get a file you
[03:49:54.680 --> 03:49:59.000]  know once you get dirty pictures of somebody engaged in pedophilia politician or business
[03:49:59.000 --> 03:50:03.800]  leader you own them for life it's one of the most economic ways to control there is i hate to say
[03:50:03.800 --> 03:50:08.440]  it but that's the reality if you look at the history of narcotics trafficking and mortgage
[03:50:08.440 --> 03:50:13.960]  fraud in this country it's intimately linked with with pedophilia and sex slavery you know i just
[03:50:13.960 --> 03:50:19.160]  paid to say it that's the way it is and i got on to dinecore in the 90s because you had a couple
[03:50:19.160 --> 03:50:26.120]  of whistleblowers um when dinecore was a government contract they you had their project managers
[03:50:26.120 --> 03:50:30.520]  literally engaged in owning you know buying and owning children and using them for sex and
[03:50:31.160 --> 03:50:36.760]  and and working with the local mafias who were who were tracking it and yet the state department
[03:50:36.760 --> 03:50:40.360]  where dinecore is the biggest contract was forgiving all of this anyway this is all on the
[03:50:40.360 --> 03:50:45.720]  public record and then dinecore started to pop up in child protective services contracts around the
[03:50:45.720 --> 03:50:51.080]  country and we were in a stay there stay there i'm gonna have to have you back for a full hour

[03:54:21.240 --> 03:54:28.280]  planet dot tv viewers i was just showing mainstream news articles i have congressional hearings
[03:54:28.280 --> 03:54:33.320]  were dying core they say well you kidnap tens of thousands of children for sex slaves and then
[03:54:33.320 --> 03:54:39.160]  they ask rumsfeld why are they allowed to do this and he just said they just are and again the
[03:54:39.160 --> 03:54:45.000]  magnitude of the evil and dying core i'd know some of this but she sent me a link to news articles
[03:54:45.000 --> 03:54:50.120]  and government purchase orders where they're involved all over warehousing the kids once
[03:54:50.120 --> 03:54:54.840]  they're taken so now it's not enough to grab iraqi kids or serve kids now they're grabbing our kids
[03:54:54.840 --> 03:55:04.040]  katharine finish your story okay so so i'm uh the way i got onto this was i was in washington and i
[03:55:04.040 --> 03:55:10.360]  i had come on to dying core because of their role in the war on drugs and um i'll i'll tell you two
[03:55:10.360 --> 03:55:17.080]  stories the first was a group of peasant women from south america came up to to give a presentation
[03:55:17.080 --> 03:55:23.640]  to congressman and they gave a presentation in washington on how um they were being moved off
[03:55:23.640 --> 03:55:28.680]  their land private people were picking up their land for cheap and then the government was building
[03:55:28.680 --> 03:55:34.120]  housing and you know this whole war on game drug game and so i kept asking them questions and
[03:55:34.120 --> 03:55:39.000]  finally they got very suspicious and said how come you know so much about how the money works in our
[03:55:39.000 --> 03:55:44.280]  country and i said well i was the assistant secretary of housing and apparently it works
[03:55:44.280 --> 03:55:49.560]  the same way in your country that works at ours so afterwards i did a little research and discovered
[03:55:49.560 --> 03:55:57.880]  the same contractor in enforcement at HUD in this country was the lead contractor in latin america
[03:55:57.880 --> 03:56:02.920]  in the war on drugs it was dying core so i started to get in and look at dying core and on and on and
[03:56:02.920 --> 03:56:09.080]  on and that's when the story of the sex slave trafficking came out and it was unbelievable
[03:56:09.080 --> 03:56:14.440]  because insight magazine alex wrote a great story about sex slave trafficking the allegations
[03:56:15.080 --> 03:56:22.440]  in connection with the dying core litigation those magazines cover story were dropped on
[03:56:22.440 --> 03:56:28.120]  every senator in every congressman's uh desk and the next week both the navy and the state
[03:56:28.120 --> 03:56:33.880]  department gave huge new contracts to dying core you know so it didn't seem to matter it was quite
[03:56:33.880 --> 03:56:40.680]  amazing anyway so so fast forward i i ended up writing a series of stories about dying core
[03:56:40.680 --> 03:56:47.320]  and illuminating what was going on because in fact the chairman of the finance committee at enron
[03:56:47.960 --> 03:56:53.320]  um was a private investor who was the chairman a lead investor for many years in dying cores
[03:56:53.320 --> 03:56:57.880]  and the linkages between dying core and some of what was going on with the funny money was pretty
[03:56:57.880 --> 03:57:06.120]  scary so um when our litigation was very hot and heavy i and of course dying core was a big
[03:57:06.120 --> 03:57:11.080]  contractor at the department of justice and was said by the inslaw people to be one of the managers
[03:57:11.080 --> 03:57:16.760]  of the promise software anyway so we're in the middle of the litigation and i have a person
[03:57:16.760 --> 03:57:22.360]  one of the people working for me helping me do the litigation support work which was very time
[03:57:22.360 --> 03:57:29.080]  consuming came to me and said you know um uh somebody from child protective services showed
[03:57:29.080 --> 03:57:35.960]  up at my house and uh she she's an old you know she's a single mom we got a minute and a half left
[03:57:35.960 --> 03:57:39.720]  so finish up on this and so she said i'm sure it's a mistake and i said no no no no this is
[03:57:39.720 --> 03:57:46.200]  dangerous we need to research find out if dying core is is the contractor for child protective
[03:57:46.200 --> 03:57:51.880]  services sure enough they were and we literally had to get her to move to another state and this
[03:57:51.880 --> 03:57:58.840]  is a child molestation army so well but but what what you need to but so last last week when i saw
[03:57:58.840 --> 03:58:04.040]  what was going on texas i said you want to check and see whether dying core is behind you know
[03:58:04.040 --> 03:58:08.360]  is in the mix because the idea of going after people's children just because they disagree
[03:58:08.360 --> 03:58:14.200]  with government policy this is a real risk this is pure evil you had one more point you wanted
[03:58:14.200 --> 03:58:20.840]  to make yes i just wanted to thank you alex you sent two of your incredible producers down to my
[03:58:20.840 --> 03:58:25.960]  house um during a snowstorm they came all the way after Memphis in a snowstorm i never thought they'd
[03:58:25.960 --> 03:58:30.760]  make it we spent a day filming they were so intelligent they were so professional they were
[03:58:30.760 --> 03:58:38.040]  so capable i said wow you know alex jones is going to a whole new level what a team i was very
[03:58:38.040 --> 03:58:51.720]  impressed you're a sweetheart kathryn awson fits god bless you
