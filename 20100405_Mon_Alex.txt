[00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:09.658]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.658 --> 00:00:11.240]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.821]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.821 --> 00:00:16.985]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:21.050]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:29.832]  There's too many people in Northern Mexico and Southern California.
[00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:33.053]  That's what caused the earthquake.
[00:00:33.053 --> 00:00:44.417]  Or at least, that's what that particular congressman, Hank Johnson from Georgia, must believe.
[00:00:44.417 --> 00:00:46.138]  He thinks islands are floating and
[00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.335]  are buoyant like a beach ball and that if too many people get on the edge of an island it'll make it tump over into the ocean like a sailboat.
[00:00:54.335 --> 00:01:10.606]  That's the type of mindset we're dealing with with the dumbed-down general public and even some members of Congress who allow Al Gore and others to tell them fables, fairy tales, children's stories to scare them into submission.
[00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:14.409]  It's a very childlike public that we have
[00:01:15.836 --> 00:01:22.903]  In many sectors of our society, and it's up to us, the adults, to reach out to these people and to educate them.
[00:01:22.903 --> 00:01:27.767]  We don't have time to screw around anymore.
[00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:31.351]  It is Monday, the fifth day of April 2010.
[00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:35.755]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:40.019]  Congressman Ron Paul will be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:01:43.214 --> 00:01:46.237]  via cell phone on the road.
[00:01:46.237 --> 00:01:53.884]  So I would remind my producers now, get that cell phone number when he does call us like last time because it's sure to cut out.
[00:01:53.884 --> 00:02:06.495]  Also, Catherine Austin Fitch will be joining us to talk about what's happening in the economy and what the parasite elite, the ruling class, are setting up.
[00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:08.758]  So that's always extremely informative with
[00:02:09.378 --> 00:02:13.262]  Catherine Austin Fitch.
[00:02:13.262 --> 00:02:18.307]  We work at the highest levels of the federal government.
[00:02:18.307 --> 00:02:27.496]  We are going to have open phones also in the first, second, third and fourth hour today on any issue you wish to discuss.
[00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:40.849]  We've seen the UN and Danny Glover say that the earthquakes in Haiti and the earthquake in Chile were caused by carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.210]  It's part of our atmosphere.
[00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:54.117]  I'm looking for them to say that the earthquake in Southern California, the 7.2 magnitude earthquake, at least 20 million people felt the quake according to seismologists.
[00:02:54.117 --> 00:02:55.878]  And I've also seen
[00:02:59.835 --> 00:03:06.881]  Other newscast in previous earthquakes in Southern California being blamed on global warming.
[00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:13.427]  I mean, this is just the height of conscious lying and deception.
[00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:21.034]  I won't be surprised if they don't start telling people that science is settled and that islands do float on top of the water and are going to capsize.
[00:03:22.478 --> 00:03:25.821]  So we'll be breaking that down today.
[00:03:25.821 --> 00:03:28.082]  I also want to play an audio clip.
[00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:31.765]  The video is up on PrisonPlanet.com and an article by Steve Watson.
[00:03:31.765 --> 00:03:35.548]  Illinois Congressman, I don't worry about the Constitution.
[00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:40.712]  They brought up the fact that the health bill is unconstitutional to him and he didn't deny that.
[00:03:40.712 --> 00:03:44.375]  He said, I don't care and I don't worry about the Constitution.
[00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:50.380]  I guess like George Bush said, it's just a GD piece of paper.
[00:03:52.435 --> 00:03:57.840]  What, one could eat no fat and one could eat no lean, and so between the two they lick the platter clean?
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.246]  A nursery rhyme?
[00:04:03.246 --> 00:04:08.351]  Republicans hate one side of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and shred it as fast as they can.
[00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:10.653]  The Democrats hate the other side of it.
[00:04:10.653 --> 00:04:12.996]  And between the two, they lick the platter clean.
[00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.831]  Well, it's even worse than that.
[00:04:15.831 --> 00:04:20.453]  The Republicans always rail against Democratic policies until they get power, then they keep it.
[00:04:20.453 --> 00:04:32.800]  The Democrats always rail against what the Republicans put into place, and then they keep it for themselves as well.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.203]  Okay, I'm going to run down the news on the other side of this quick break.
[00:04:38.203 --> 00:04:43.766]  And Greenpeace is calling for violence.
[00:04:44.983 --> 00:04:46.864]  And saying, we know where you live.
[00:04:46.864 --> 00:04:56.010]  Those of you that criticize their takeover of society, this group of mafia thugs, they say, we know where you live.
[00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.353]  The essence of the red, banker-backed terror.
[00:05:00.762 --> 00:05:03.786]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.786 --> 00:05:09.113]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.113 --> 00:05:11.156]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.156 --> 00:05:15.742]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:15.742 --> 00:05:16.222]  We're good to go!
[00:05:39.153 --> 00:05:40.374]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.374 --> 00:05:41.274]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:42.394]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.394 --> 00:05:43.315]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.315 --> 00:05:44.415]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.415 --> 00:05:47.456]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:05:49.657 --> 00:05:50.658]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.991]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:09.874]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:09.874 --> 00:06:12.156]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:12.156 --> 00:06:18.040]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:24.705]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.705 --> 00:06:30.690]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.433]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:39.134]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:39.134 --> 00:06:45.096]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:45.096 --> 00:06:48.638]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.638 --> 00:06:50.618]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:51.739]  It's here.

[00:07:29.429 --> 00:07:30.670]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:35.053]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:07:35.053 --> 00:07:41.037]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:07:41.037 --> 00:07:44.679]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:07:44.679 --> 00:07:47.401]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:52.464]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:07:52.464 --> 00:07:52.705]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:54.106]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:02.334]  Big Brother
[00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:08.501]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.501 --> 00:08:10.262]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.262 --> 00:08:11.863]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.863 --> 00:08:13.424]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.424 --> 00:08:17.608]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.608 --> 00:08:21.671]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:42.232 --> 00:08:44.975]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:08:44.975 --> 00:08:49.379]  It is Monday, the fifth day of April 2010.
[00:08:49.379 --> 00:08:55.004]  Until the bottom of the hour, we have Congressman Ron Paul with us, and we appreciate him coming on.
[00:08:55.004 --> 00:08:56.065]  Congressman, good to have you here.
[00:08:58.237 --> 00:09:00.057]  There is so much going on.
[00:09:00.057 --> 00:09:08.299]  I've got a lot of important questions I want to ask you, but out of the gates, what is most important on your plate that you want to warn the American people about today?
[00:09:08.299 --> 00:09:11.840]  Oh, there are too many things.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.441]  And I don't know which one's the worst.
[00:09:14.441 --> 00:09:18.722]  You know, the finances, they're so bad and they're getting much worse.
[00:09:19.133 --> 00:09:25.077]  You know, the way they're spending the money, running up the debt, I think that the financial crisis is getting so much closer.
[00:09:25.077 --> 00:09:26.658]  Interest rates are going up.
[00:09:26.658 --> 00:09:30.521]  I think that's a major, major problem we face.
[00:09:30.521 --> 00:09:46.832]  What bugs me about it is that I don't think he believes that he's achieved great things, you know, by flooding the market, saving the country from depression, taking care of his friends, and the people who lost their jobs don't have a voice.
[00:09:46.832 --> 00:09:48.773]  So he thinks he's had a great victory.
[00:09:49.474 --> 00:09:52.775]  But the second thing is what's going on over the Middle East.
[00:09:52.775 --> 00:09:54.215]  That's getting much worse.
[00:09:54.215 --> 00:09:56.496]  The Iraqi situation is worse.
[00:09:56.496 --> 00:09:59.856]  There's rumors now that they won't remove any troops at all.
[00:09:59.856 --> 00:10:04.057]  And, of course, we're going to be up to 100,000 troops in Afghanistan.
[00:10:04.057 --> 00:10:11.179]  And Karzai is now, you know, feeling very bold and critical of the United States.
[00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:29.416]  When that happens, you know, I just wonder how we'll handle that because, you know, at times when our good friends start to act on their own, we usually get rid of them or, you know, desert them or go on their own, you know, so I think that thing is a whole mess and can really blow up in our face.
[00:10:30.097 --> 00:10:33.520]  Well let's get into the economy then first.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:55.439]  I've seen the different job charts showing that this is the worst recession since the late nineteen forties and meanwhile I have a business week article from two weeks ago where the federal regulators are pressuring public and private pension funds to be invested quote in failed banks.
[00:10:55.439 --> 00:10:56.199]  We have Geithner
[00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:59.876]  I don't think there's any doubt about that.
[00:10:59.876 --> 00:11:01.877]  But there's still a lot of people with their head in the sand.
[00:11:27.023 --> 00:11:31.847]  I don't know whether they're lying to themselves, but some of them really believe that things have turned around.
[00:11:31.847 --> 00:11:40.613]  They look at the other side of the story, and they say, you know, more jobs are being found, and it's staying under 10%, and GDP is going up.
[00:11:44.131 --> 00:11:50.676]  And they either try to fool the people or they fool themselves, but ultimately, though, the market rules.
[00:11:50.676 --> 00:11:55.000]  The market will dictate, and everybody will catch on.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:06.429]  But I think where the disconnect is, is that the government is putting a positive spin on it, but, you know, the people that you talk to and the people in the Tea Party movement, they know better.
[00:12:06.429 --> 00:12:08.931]  You know, that's why they're so doggone upset.
[00:12:08.931 --> 00:12:10.232]  They're not buying into this.
[00:12:10.232 --> 00:12:13.455]  This is a completely different year than we've had, I guess,
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:34.530]  Well, the AP reported last week that half of the so-called new jobs are government jobs and census jobs, and we know that the unemployment number is really above 20%, so even with cooked numbers, they're claiming that we've gotten a small amount of job increases.
[00:12:35.467 --> 00:12:39.693]  Yeah, and in this last report, there was a lot of part-time jobs, too.
[00:12:39.693 --> 00:12:41.315]  They weren't real jobs.
[00:12:41.315 --> 00:12:50.787]  There was part-time jobs, government jobs, and I don't think there's much good news in that report at all.
[00:12:52.711 --> 00:12:55.933]  Congressman Ron Paul, let's talk about the health care bill.
[00:12:55.933 --> 00:13:01.536]  How it was passed, what it really does, the best ways you think the states can counter this.
[00:13:01.536 --> 00:13:08.520]  I think we shouldn't just have lawsuits and entrust the federal courts state-level nullification.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:15.084]  Specifically on the health care bill, you talked about Obama being emboldened.
[00:13:15.084 --> 00:13:21.648]  Now he wants his carbon tax to try to pass that in the Senate, declaring CO2 a toxic waste.
[00:13:22.711 --> 00:13:39.437]  Let's talk about health care legislation because we've seen Obama say, look, it's been a few weeks since this passed, the birds are singing, the sun is shining, but he knows that this thing doesn't get phased in but until next year and the three years after that.
[00:13:39.437 --> 00:13:42.758]  So that's a very deceptive game he's playing of perception.
[00:13:45.126 --> 00:13:53.647]  And you know what he'll probably do is by that time, whoever's in charge, if he's there, whoever, he'll say, oh, maybe we didn't do quite enough.
[00:13:53.647 --> 00:13:53.948]  Maybe...
[00:13:54.722 --> 00:14:01.585]  Maybe what we really need is a single-payer system, so failure to them is just another opportunity.
[00:14:01.585 --> 00:14:16.011]  And if in the next year or next six months the people only hear good news and they don't see what it's going to really cost, you know, he may get away with it for a year without it coming down hard on them.
[00:14:16.611 --> 00:14:25.841]  Ultimately, though, it's an illusion to think that they can do what they claim and not cost any money and improve health care.
[00:14:25.841 --> 00:14:28.704]  That's a hard sell.
[00:14:28.704 --> 00:14:34.530]  Well, you're a medical doctor yourself, not just a congressman, and of course you're also
[00:14:35.993 --> 00:14:36.093]  Well,
[00:14:55.188 --> 00:15:02.853]  The process that, if the people were awake enough and there were enough of us, it would be just to change the Congress, change the President, repeal all that stuff.
[00:15:02.853 --> 00:15:06.676]  I mean, that's the smoothest way to do it.
[00:15:06.676 --> 00:15:11.179]  The part that bothered me the most, of course, the process that you talked about.
[00:15:11.179 --> 00:15:18.103]  I mean, how they pulled it off and, you know, we pass a rule and the rule passed the Senate version, and then they go to reconciliation.
[00:15:18.103 --> 00:15:18.804]  That was horrible.
[00:15:19.811 --> 00:15:27.695]  I think, philosophically, the worst part was that they moved away from any opening for a private option.
[00:15:27.695 --> 00:15:30.296]  You know, they talk about a public option, but what about a private option?
[00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:33.517]  Why don't individuals have the right to get out?
[00:15:33.517 --> 00:15:41.661]  Fortunately, some people, you know, opt out of the public school system and they have private schooling and homeschooling.
[00:15:41.661 --> 00:15:43.702]  Why don't we have that in medicine?
[00:15:43.702 --> 00:15:44.622]  Let them opt out.
[00:15:44.622 --> 00:15:45.983]  That's the HSA approach.
[00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:48.183]  But they minimize those.
[00:15:48.183 --> 00:15:49.384]  It's much more difficult.
[00:15:49.384 --> 00:15:52.865]  And if you opt out to say, I don't want it.
[00:15:52.865 --> 00:15:54.385]  I'll take care of myself.
[00:15:54.385 --> 00:15:55.585]  I'll handle everything.
[00:15:55.585 --> 00:15:57.986]  I don't want to be a board of the state.
[00:15:57.986 --> 00:15:59.546]  You have to pay a fine.
[00:15:59.546 --> 00:16:01.427]  You know, pay your $9,000.
[00:16:01.427 --> 00:16:07.128]  And that to me was a big, big move in the wrong direction.
[00:16:09.088 --> 00:16:13.030]  Instead of thinking today after a bill like this is passed, oh, let's repeal the whole thing.
[00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:23.153]  Well, you know, that'd be great if you could, but maybe if we would narrow it down, and I want to introduce legislation for this, just narrow it down to legalize
[00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:25.231]  I don't think so.
[00:16:41.571 --> 00:16:50.075]  But I would like to see the day where we just have a changeover in Congress and we wouldn't be fighting these things over and over.
[00:16:50.075 --> 00:16:57.459]  I mean, they passed this stuff and then people now are becoming more informed and they get upset.
[00:16:57.459 --> 00:17:00.480]  So there's a lot of frustration out there turning into anger.
[00:17:05.649 --> 00:17:09.292]  What do you see as the best strategy to defeat this, though, at the state level?
[00:17:09.292 --> 00:17:11.693]  I mean, can't the states nullify this?
[00:17:11.693 --> 00:17:18.618]  Because it does force the states to pay for a large part of the federal mandate.
[00:17:18.618 --> 00:17:23.081]  And so we have Attorney Generals now suing, but I don't think that's enough.
[00:17:23.081 --> 00:17:29.946]  I'm all for that if people want to do it, but they're behind the eight ball there.
[00:17:29.946 --> 00:17:31.047]  It's not going to be accomplished.
[00:17:32.062 --> 00:17:39.829]  You know, they take our highway funds, and then they come and say, well, you get your highway funds from the federal government, we're going to set your speed limit.
[00:17:39.829 --> 00:17:45.575]  Everybody has to drive 55 miles an hour, you know, that's what they did for 20 years.
[00:17:45.575 --> 00:17:49.018]  And they say, no, we're not going to do that, we're going to fight it, we don't want that federal law.
[00:17:49.018 --> 00:17:52.281]  Alright, we'll just keep your highway funds.
[00:17:52.281 --> 00:17:57.166]  And that's what they'll do on Medicare, you know, I mean, what are you going to do, repeal every state?
[00:17:57.917 --> 00:18:03.262]  Participation in Medicaid and this system, and then they'll make the problems worse.
[00:18:03.262 --> 00:18:04.784]  There are unfunded mandates.
[00:18:04.784 --> 00:18:10.829]  They're going to have more unfunded mandates if they just, you know, try to ignore the law.
[00:18:10.829 --> 00:18:20.378]  So I think if states want to do it, and I think it's good that they're talking about it, and they pass these resolutions, that represents
[00:18:20.936 --> 00:18:26.517]  You know, some good PR on how upset the people are, but I don't think that is the solution.
[00:18:26.517 --> 00:18:40.101]  The ultimate solution for all this is people having a better understanding and a better trust in the way the market works and the way freedom works and you don't need the government, need any state taking care of us from cradle to grave.
[00:18:40.101 --> 00:18:47.883]  If that isn't repealed, that attitude, uh, pinking around on the edges of pieces of legislation won't do the trick.
[00:18:49.827 --> 00:18:56.672]  Congressman, you've talked about the fact that what's really going to end this is the country collapsing financially.
[00:18:56.672 --> 00:18:58.132]  Can you speak to that?
[00:18:58.132 --> 00:19:18.386]  And then also, as a medical doctor, my dad's a physician, and everyone knows that federal money comes in for abortion, and then these hospitals and clinics just use money that they would have used for something else, for the abortion, and use the other federal money to pay for the other programs, so it's a shell game.
[00:19:19.588 --> 00:19:26.357]  Yeah, and that whole thing, and that process, which was very annoying when they couldn't agree on the abortion language.
[00:19:26.357 --> 00:19:29.380]  So, Obama, it was easy for him.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.503]  Alright, if you guys won't write a law, I'll write a law.
[00:19:31.503 --> 00:19:32.424]  I'll write my own law.
[00:19:32.424 --> 00:19:35.067]  I'll write up an executive order.
[00:19:35.067 --> 00:19:36.830]  And I will state the High Amendment.
[00:19:37.409 --> 00:19:41.152]  Now, they argued back and forth, some of the conservatives did.
[00:19:41.152 --> 00:19:42.933]  Oh, well, that won't count.
[00:19:42.933 --> 00:19:47.357]  That isn't, uh, the, you take the border isn't the law of the land.
[00:19:47.357 --> 00:19:51.240]  Um, I don't think that was the right argument, because it is the law of the land.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.463]  The reason it isn't effective is what you hinted at, is
[00:19:55.495 --> 00:19:59.978]  That the Hyde Amendment, I don't think it ever did that much.
[00:19:59.978 --> 00:20:06.002]  You have to strike all the funds to all these pregnancy centers that are doing abortion.
[00:20:06.002 --> 00:20:10.044]  And they say, well the Hyde Amendment says you can't use any funds for abortion.
[00:20:10.044 --> 00:20:12.206]  Oh yeah, but you can use them for birth control pills.
[00:20:12.822 --> 00:20:14.423]  So, they get shifted.
[00:20:14.423 --> 00:20:15.964]  The money's all fungible.
[00:20:15.964 --> 00:20:20.288]  And when the money gets shifted over, they go ahead and do the abortion.
[00:20:20.288 --> 00:20:23.430]  So, that was all a con game.
[00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:28.794]  But it emphasized the process on how that whole thing was being passed.
[00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:36.480]  But this bill, in addition to what I said earlier, has put a lot more
[00:20:37.431 --> 00:20:41.332]  Uh, obstacles between the doctor and the patient.
[00:20:41.332 --> 00:20:54.437]  We've always, in recent years, we've had insurance companies and HMO companies and drug companies, but now we're going to have a lot of bureaucrats making decisions about how to practice health care.
[00:20:54.437 --> 00:21:03.600]  And, uh, that, of course, it'll cost a lot more money, but the money's going to go to paying bureaucrats and paying extra people to push papers around.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.900]  So this is, uh,
[00:21:05.709 --> 00:21:10.092]  It's going to be costly and the care is going to go down and it's just a lot more people.
[00:21:10.092 --> 00:21:24.840]  And they admit that with this comparative care that now the bureaucrats will decide and they're actually in the news today saying look you won't get knee surgery you'll get a cortisone or steroid shot and oh well
[00:21:26.121 --> 00:21:37.250]  You'll get Prozac, we'll just basically drug you and so they cut Medicare and Medicaid, they raise taxes and then they restrict benefits.
[00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.012]  This is exactly what Europe has done and
[00:21:42.318 --> 00:21:42.518]  Yeah.
[00:22:04.082 --> 00:22:08.945]  Isn't this a red herring when they say, oh, the right-wingers just don't want poor people to get care?
[00:22:08.945 --> 00:22:16.690]  I mean, really, all this is is government coming in, teamed up with corporations to basically lower the standard of care but make more money.
[00:22:18.575 --> 00:22:20.676]  I think that's absolutely right.
[00:22:20.676 --> 00:22:25.439]  We don't have the classical socialized medicine.
[00:22:25.439 --> 00:22:26.719]  We're not on the verge of having that.
[00:22:26.719 --> 00:22:28.740]  I don't even think Obama was pushing it.
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.161]  He was pushing for corporate medicine.
[00:22:31.161 --> 00:22:35.383]  He was not going to have to destroy the insurance companies.
[00:22:35.383 --> 00:22:39.605]  They might have complained a bit to get their best deal, but they're pretty happy right now.
[00:22:39.605 --> 00:22:41.346]  They have a lot more customers.
[00:22:41.346 --> 00:22:42.587]  The bills will be paid.
[00:22:43.643 --> 00:22:48.906]  And they'll do quite fine, but we have the corporations get involved.
[00:22:48.906 --> 00:22:51.847]  We talked a lot about the military-industrial complex.
[00:22:51.847 --> 00:22:56.810]  There's a medical-industrial complex, too.
[00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:02.912]  All the big corporations and governments, and they do spend a lot of money on lobbying.
[00:23:02.912 --> 00:23:05.914]  So there's some big bucks made.
[00:23:05.914 --> 00:23:12.497]  And if we've conditioned, somehow or another, our country has been conditioned to believe that medicine is different.
[00:23:13.137 --> 00:23:18.079]  You deliver medicine and the world does it better, the government has to do it.
[00:23:18.079 --> 00:23:24.161]  Everybody has a right to medical care, but therefore the government has to give you this right to take care of it.
[00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:28.302]  And we're not even close to changing that attitude.
[00:23:28.302 --> 00:23:33.243]  Matter of fact, when I say that on TV, it sort of shocks people.
[00:23:33.243 --> 00:23:34.064]  What?
[00:23:34.064 --> 00:23:34.604]  You're saying
[00:23:35.445 --> 00:23:37.086]  I don't have a right to medical care.
[00:23:37.086 --> 00:23:37.867]  Of course not.
[00:23:37.867 --> 00:23:39.328]  You have a right to your life.
[00:23:39.328 --> 00:23:40.889]  You have a right to your liberty.
[00:23:40.889 --> 00:23:44.132]  You have a right to your life where you can take care of your medical care.
[00:23:44.132 --> 00:23:47.314]  Well, Congressman, I mean, you've been a medical doctor for 40 years.
[00:23:47.314 --> 00:24:02.025]  I mean, you know better than anybody that government involvement in health care in the last 40 years is what's added all these layers of costs and allowed big corporate medical care to institutionalize things and get into people's bank accounts.
[00:24:02.025 --> 00:24:03.747]  And so now it's only going to get worse.
[00:24:05.267 --> 00:24:15.755]  That's right, and the companies will make a lot of money on it, and the patients ultimately will become very unhappy.
[00:24:15.755 --> 00:24:22.120]  And, of course, the doctors are more unhappy than ever before, and who knows what will happen there.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.482]  Of course, there were threats that a lot of doctors would quit.
[00:24:24.482 --> 00:24:29.046]  I'm not sure that's going to happen because they don't have a whole lot of options.
[00:24:29.046 --> 00:24:32.868]  They've been trained a long time to practice medicine.
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.229]  They're going to have to find something else.
[00:24:36.229 --> 00:24:38.718]  They'll probably moan and groan.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.362]  Put up with one more layer of government.
[00:24:42.362 --> 00:24:57.413]  Congressman, shifting gears into some other subjects, I don't know if you've seen this video yet, but Representative Hank Johnson said he didn't want us to be able to move more troops to Guam because he was afraid that the floating island would capsize, and he was serious.
[00:24:57.413 --> 00:25:07.040]  Representative Phil Hare of Illinois is on video last Friday saying he, quote, doesn't worry about the Constitution because, you know, health care is a right.
[00:25:08.241 --> 00:25:12.665]  And so, as you've said many times, it's not just some evil force in Washington.
[00:25:12.665 --> 00:25:14.606]  We know the globalists play into that.
[00:25:14.606 --> 00:25:21.753]  We've also got a lot of other congressmen and government people that really are, unfortunately, as dumb as a box of rocks.
[00:25:21.753 --> 00:25:29.499]  Can you comment to people thinking that islands float and that the Constitution isn't important?
[00:25:29.499 --> 00:25:34.043]  I didn't hear it, but you say he sounded like he was serious?
[00:25:34.043 --> 00:25:34.264]  Yes.
[00:25:36.228 --> 00:25:38.070]  That's pretty bizarre.
[00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:49.858]  But, um, I think even there once was not going to allow a Republican president that said something rather careless about his conviction that we're supposed to follow the Constitution.
[00:25:49.858 --> 00:25:54.581]  I mean, it's... I guess what amazes us in shock is if they actually say it.
[00:25:54.581 --> 00:26:02.166]  We know they either are totally ignorant and don't understand the Constitution, or they don't have any respect and they don't care about following it.
[00:26:02.166 --> 00:26:04.308]  But for them to say that
[00:26:05.018 --> 00:26:06.801]  Oh, we don't have to do that.
[00:26:06.801 --> 00:26:07.763]  We don't want to do that.
[00:26:07.763 --> 00:26:09.365]  We don't need to do that.
[00:26:09.365 --> 00:26:14.153]  I think it's still shocking for somebody to actually say that.
[00:26:14.153 --> 00:26:14.554]  It is.
[00:26:15.933 --> 00:26:19.076]  We've only got about three, four minutes left with Congressman Ron Paul today.
[00:26:19.076 --> 00:26:23.120]  I wanted to bring up your son in Kentucky, Rand Paul.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:33.571]  In many polls, ten points ahead, the Democrat and Republican challengers showing that this anti-incumbency and this hunger for a constitutionalist-type candidate runs across party lines.
[00:26:33.571 --> 00:26:37.395]  And the Republican Party has in Politico and other publications said
[00:26:38.035 --> 00:26:43.137]  They are gunning for your son, who is a true conservative and a libertarian.
[00:26:43.137 --> 00:26:56.663]  And of course, as you know, two weeks ago, the state election commission there ruled that Trey Grayson can run the election commission and can oversee his own election.
[00:26:56.663 --> 00:27:00.324]  No other state that I've seen has ever allowed this type of conflict of interest.
[00:27:00.324 --> 00:27:07.567]  Can you speak to that as a new level of corruption and any concern that you have for the election coming up in Kentucky?
[00:27:08.069 --> 00:27:10.390]  Well, I'm very concerned about it.
[00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:12.271]  I'm shocked that they allowed that to happen.
[00:27:12.271 --> 00:27:19.334]  But you think, politically, the Grant's campaign could get the mileage out of that and get the people on their side.
[00:27:19.334 --> 00:27:21.735]  But that might not change the outcome of the election.
[00:27:21.735 --> 00:27:26.977]  A closed election doesn't take a whole lot of work and effort to change things.
[00:27:26.977 --> 00:27:34.280]  So, I think it's our purge to make sure they have the poll watchers and everything else, and do everything conceivable to
[00:27:36.855 --> 00:27:37.716]  I think so.
[00:27:55.916 --> 00:28:04.228]  Well, I mean, there's no doubt that he is the chief election official running the election, and the Kentucky Executive Branch Ethics Commission said that was fine.
[00:28:04.228 --> 00:28:07.092]  I mean, this is a felony in most states.
[00:28:07.092 --> 00:28:09.095]  People have to recuse themselves.
[00:28:09.095 --> 00:28:11.718]  I mean, on its face, he's got all these employees that know
[00:28:12.239 --> 00:28:12.800]  Well I'll tell you, I think
[00:28:35.796 --> 00:28:38.838]  The thing is, they were honest about what was going on.
[00:28:38.838 --> 00:28:47.723]  They wouldn't want to even be close to it, you know, because if they figure they're going to win and they pull it off and win legitimately, nobody's going to believe them anyway.
[00:28:47.723 --> 00:28:56.248]  So you would think they would be, you know, the Grayson people would be the ones that would want to be away from it so that they wouldn't have that kind
[00:28:57.381 --> 00:28:57.861]  Amazing.
[00:28:57.861 --> 00:29:01.522]  Folks can find out more at thecampaignforliberty.com.
[00:29:01.522 --> 00:29:02.843]  Congressman Ron Paul is our guest.
[00:29:02.843 --> 00:29:09.805]  The last 45 seconds, the Democrats are really starting to talk about censoring the internet, censoring talk radio.
[00:29:09.805 --> 00:29:13.346]  If they'll violate the Constitution on all these other fronts, why not there?
[00:29:13.346 --> 00:29:15.867]  Are you concerned about restrictions on free speech, cybersecurity?
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:31.093]  Oh yeah, I think, you know, I think the other day when we had a cyber security vote, I don't know if it was anybody else, but anything touching the internet or communication, I will not vote for, and they're always wanting to do that.
[00:29:31.093 --> 00:29:40.582]  I think some of the talk, I've heard about this, that we need more government management of the media to get a better balance.
[00:29:40.582 --> 00:29:41.563]  Pretty scary stuff.
[00:29:44.705 --> 00:29:45.926]  Congressman, we're going to break.
[00:29:45.926 --> 00:29:50.930]  I know you've got to go, but I want to tell you something during this break, so please hold for one moment.
[00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:52.331]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.331 --> 00:29:54.853]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.853 --> 00:29:57.555]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:33:14.818 --> 00:33:19.824]  Yeah, Ron Paul, well, lost in translation with his office.
[00:33:19.824 --> 00:33:23.728]  He was supposed to be on next hour, but hey, better early than never, huh?
[00:33:23.728 --> 00:33:26.771]  Better late than never, better early than never.
[00:33:26.771 --> 00:33:31.416]  Very informative interview with Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:33:31.416 --> 00:33:36.142]  And in the next few months, I was just talking to him during the break, we're going to get him on for a full, in-depth
[00:33:37.845 --> 00:33:39.466]  Our long interview.
[00:33:39.466 --> 00:33:49.512]  In fact, next time he comes to Austin, we're going to... I've been invited to many dinners with him and events, and I'm always busy at the times that I've got a chance to go do an extended interview with him.
[00:33:49.512 --> 00:33:58.198]  But we're going to work on doing an extended video interview or in-studio radio slash video interview with Congressman Ron Paul on a host of issues.
[00:33:59.338 --> 00:34:06.284]  I kind of got caught though with my pants down because during the next few breaks I was going to write notes up on questions I had for him.
[00:34:06.284 --> 00:34:07.204]  I normally do that.
[00:34:07.204 --> 00:34:18.794]  We also give out the Twitter account for listeners to send us questions for Big Gift so that some of your questions can be relayed to them.
[00:34:18.794 --> 00:34:22.077]  Jesse Ventura is on with us for a full hour tomorrow.
[00:34:23.342 --> 00:34:27.423]  And he's also on the road, so we want to double-check those time zones.
[00:34:27.423 --> 00:34:38.086]  It's rarely our office that gets it wrong, but that just happens when you're dealing with people's schedulers, and we've got schedulers, and there's time zones, and there's traveling going on.
[00:34:38.086 --> 00:34:46.148]  But Jesse Ventura, on a host of issues, he kicks off a new week-long speaking tour tomorrow on this radio show.
[00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:52.872]  He normally kicks it off with Larry King Live, so he may be on there tonight or tomorrow.
[00:34:52.872 --> 00:34:58.354]  I haven't checked, but he's kicking off his radio end of it here tomorrow.
[00:34:58.354 --> 00:35:07.819]  We've got Kathryn Austin Fitz coming up in the last hour today, but we've got two hours and 25 minutes laying out before us.
[00:35:09.074 --> 00:35:34.989]  uh... to cover the news and take your phone calls and that's good because a lot of important things we need to go over a doctor paul craig roberts is on with us on wednesday he said goodbye truth has fallen and taken liberty with it but uh... he's doing a few radio and tv interviews before he says shy and nara and uh... retires from the fight against the new world order at least for now and when i talk to him if we can have a guy when he first put out this uh...
[00:35:36.284 --> 00:36:04.225]  Basic resignation from the fight, you know, he just said at least for the time being he he's done with a big column twice a week and Hey, he's been fighting the stuff for many years and It's not up to any of us to do it all ourselves It's just up to each and every one of us to do what we can And to try to inform and wake up and warn as many people as we possibly can Okay, I want to get into
[00:36:09.079 --> 00:36:26.845]  The environmental movement, who they really are, and what their endgame is, and the fact that in cooked polls, upwards of 55% of people believe they're a group of criminal fraudsters who just want to tax and control our lives.
[00:36:26.845 --> 00:36:35.688]  Every environmental show, every wildlife show on cable TV, every textbook, everything I've ever seen in the last 30 years,
[00:36:40.481 --> 00:37:00.196]  Every textbook I had in public school, every show about whales, or dolphins, or giraffes, or monkeys, or apes, or dinosaurs, it just doesn't matter, is all a brainwashing event to teach humans that we're bad, we're evil, and the government's gonna restrict your lifestyle for your own good.
[00:37:00.196 --> 00:37:04.179]  Not to enslave you, but for your own good.
[00:37:04.179 --> 00:37:07.202]  And so, if you look at polls from, say, five years ago,
[00:37:09.212 --> 00:37:16.015]  60 plus percent bought into the propaganda because it was culturally and morally the thing to do if you were a caring person.
[00:37:16.015 --> 00:37:19.096]  We've seen a flip-flop of that number.
[00:37:19.096 --> 00:37:36.303]  Now the majority, and that's in mainstream USA Today, CNN, Cook, polls, where they go to their constituents, people, demographics that they know are going to give them a pro-environmentalist takeover, slant.
[00:37:36.303 --> 00:37:36.983]  They go to them,
[00:37:38.334 --> 00:37:44.577]  And 55 upwards of 60 percent, depending on the poll, show that.
[00:37:44.577 --> 00:37:55.803]  Some other focus groups and studies I've seen the last few months, since ClimateGate broke back in November of last year, show that upwards of 80 plus percent know it's a fraud.
[00:37:55.803 --> 00:38:04.228]  And when you get big environmental congressmen like Hank Johnson in a global warming rant talking about islands capsizing, tumping over,
[00:38:05.558 --> 00:38:06.798]  And he even does the hand gesture.
[00:38:06.798 --> 00:38:11.900]  He says the island will flip over if there's too many people on it.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:16.461]  It's gonna go to 90% very quickly because this is really a peer pressure type thing.
[00:38:16.461 --> 00:38:22.083]  And as people learn it's okay to come out and talk about global warming being a fraud, the whole thing falls apart.
[00:38:22.083 --> 00:38:29.645]  It's like Gandhi said, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[00:38:29.645 --> 00:38:31.586]  And we've now entered the attack phase.
[00:38:33.723 --> 00:38:39.225]  And so we've seen Greenpeace, we've seen the founder of the Gaia Movement, we've seen the UN.
[00:38:39.225 --> 00:38:46.028]  We've seen them all say, okay, it doesn't matter if you don't want a green global government, a green world order.
[00:38:46.028 --> 00:38:48.169]  That's what the UN called it.
[00:38:48.169 --> 00:38:50.610]  In fact, guys, I forgot to print it for this piece I'm about to do.
[00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:53.711]  It was a Watson article about a month ago.
[00:38:53.711 --> 00:38:55.012]  It was actually in the UN document.
[00:38:55.012 --> 00:38:58.934]  The headline is, UN Calls for Green World Order.
[00:38:58.934 --> 00:38:59.674]  That's their quote.
[00:39:00.854 --> 00:39:05.217]  And it is just, to say it's hellish, what is a word?
[00:39:05.217 --> 00:39:07.519]  A word is only a word.
[00:39:07.519 --> 00:39:14.565]  Hellish authoritarian control is real and is indescribable until you've been through it.
[00:39:14.565 --> 00:39:20.949]  And just my investigations into corruption and oppression have scarred me fundamentally.
[00:39:20.949 --> 00:39:25.253]  And I've grown up in a great country, in a great state, with great parents.
[00:39:25.253 --> 00:39:28.175]  And I did see government drug dealing in high school.
[00:39:28.175 --> 00:39:29.376]  I did see corruption.
[00:39:33.157 --> 00:39:35.158]  I was attacked by illegal aliens.
[00:39:35.158 --> 00:39:43.064]  I mean, I have experienced the fruits of the New World Order, but I've also experienced all the good things in our world that the government likes to take credit for.
[00:39:43.064 --> 00:39:46.546]  No, the world is a great place despite what they're doing.
[00:39:47.725 --> 00:39:56.272]  And Obama knows, this is why he says, oh the birds are still tweeting, it's still a beautiful day, there's flowers, there's trees, there's the sky.
[00:39:56.272 --> 00:39:59.594]  How many times have I made that point over the years?
[00:39:59.594 --> 00:40:03.377]  They know it's a beautiful, wonderful world, it's a blessing to be in it.
[00:40:03.377 --> 00:40:13.886]  They know there's all this good in the world, and they always take credit for all the good, and then they know you don't recognize the evil because it's masquerading as good, and they know that there's this whole backdrop.
[00:40:17.594 --> 00:40:18.494]  Yeah, here's the headline.
[00:40:18.494 --> 00:40:23.157]  Leaked UN Documents Real Plan for Green World Order by 2012.
[00:40:23.157 --> 00:40:30.120]  So, they're now shifting gears and they've announced what this shift means.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:38.084]  And so I want to break this down in detail because Greenpeace is now saying, we know where you live, we're coming after you, we're going to get violent.
[00:40:38.084 --> 00:40:41.786]  And all these big environmental groups have always had auxiliary secret
[00:40:45.481 --> 00:40:49.329]  It's like Sinn Féin in Ireland that has a secret violent arm.
[00:40:49.329 --> 00:40:53.338]  But now they're coming out in the open with their Maoist brigades that work for the banks.
[00:40:56.434 --> 00:41:08.301]  So we're going to break all this down today and tie it into the media demonizing gun owners, conservatives, setting up the poor Hattari militia, clearly 100% innocent now and set up.
[00:41:08.301 --> 00:41:12.823]  But I wanted to dovetail that first segue with the Corbett Report.
[00:41:12.823 --> 00:41:14.444]  He does a great job.
[00:41:14.444 --> 00:41:22.269]  This video is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but I broke down in a 10-minute interview what the cashless society is, and then that
[00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:41.168]  It ties into the environmental takeover, so let's go ahead and play part of this ten-minute piece, and then I will go to break and come back and get into the fact that we're intellectually and politically beating the bloodthirsty Greens, who are a bunch of murderous control freaks, on record.
[00:41:41.168 --> 00:41:46.253]  They've done psychological studies of them, and how they're going to now get even more violent.
[00:41:47.406 --> 00:41:49.306]  They don't care if you know they're a fraud.
[00:41:49.306 --> 00:41:51.807]  They've got the guns, they've got the government, they're coming.
[00:41:51.807 --> 00:41:54.127]  But first, let's break down the cashless society control grid.
[00:41:54.127 --> 00:41:55.247]  Here it is.
[00:41:55.247 --> 00:41:58.208]  Hello, this is James Corbett of CorbettReport.com.
[00:41:58.208 --> 00:42:14.111]  I'm welcoming you back to Economics 101, and today I'm honored to be joined on the line by Alex Jones, the radio talk show host, documentary filmmaker, economic analyst, political commentator, and general mastermind behind Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:42:14.111 --> 00:42:16.031]  Alex Jones, thank you for joining me today on the program.
[00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:19.170]  Quite an introduction.
[00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:19.951]  Thanks for having me.
[00:42:19.951 --> 00:42:22.114]  I love your important work you're doing.
[00:42:22.114 --> 00:42:22.474]  Excellent.
[00:42:22.474 --> 00:42:31.305]  Well, today I'd like to talk specifically about the moves towards the cashless society that we've been seeing coming from every angle lately.
[00:42:31.305 --> 00:42:34.869]  We've seen this in numerous moves such as Peter Aliff, the head of Visa Europe,
[00:42:35.689 --> 00:42:38.350]  Having said that, he wanted to see a cashless society by 2012.
[00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:42.732]  We've seen the National Irish Bank moving towards cashless banking.
[00:42:42.732 --> 00:42:49.434]  We've seen even trivial examples of children's games being changed to use cashless forms of payment.
[00:42:49.434 --> 00:42:53.296]  We've seen this coming from so many angles that it seems to be a coordinated agenda.
[00:42:53.296 --> 00:42:59.538]  So, what's your take on what this agenda is and why it's so important for the economic elite to bring in a cashless society?
[00:43:02.093 --> 00:43:03.754]  Well, it's neo-feudalism.
[00:43:03.754 --> 00:43:04.514]  It's serfdom.
[00:43:04.514 --> 00:43:25.944]  You have the private banking cartels that control the issuance of currency and credit worldwide, openly announcing the formation of a global constitution between the G20 banks, openly setting up world government and bypassing the nation states and the people that live in those republics and supposed democracies.
[00:43:26.624 --> 00:43:43.211]  And so what's happening is you have the artificial fiat parasite economy waging war against the real Main Street economy or the agrarian or manufacturing economy and everything they do in their own documents is meant to
[00:43:44.151 --> 00:43:44.431]  I think?
[00:44:07.879 --> 00:44:17.793]  80% taxes in France that will make people move away from France to say the US where we have roughly 50% taxation so all of these collectivist planners
[00:44:19.293 --> 00:44:19.654]  I don't
[00:44:38.457 --> 00:44:57.612]  And getting us into a system of overtaxation regulation so that all your smaller businesses and corporations and family-owned institutions are phased out and only the Fortune 100 control the world and then they will also continue warring with each other to consolidate the power and so that's what all of this is about.
[00:44:57.612 --> 00:45:00.314]  They admit that that's what this is about and
[00:45:02.332 --> 00:45:05.555]  But that's only a means to an end.
[00:45:05.555 --> 00:45:09.218]  The end is what I cover in my film, End Game.
[00:45:09.218 --> 00:45:26.432]  Once they have the planetary cashless society surveillance grid that the Pentagon has designed in place with the license plate reading cameras, the face scanning cameras, where everyone is buying and selling according to RFID, where all products have RFID in it, they can track the real world
[00:45:27.133 --> 00:45:33.640]  Just like Google can track cyberspace and it actually allows them to predict human activity.
[00:45:35.495 --> 00:45:45.203]  Along with the mass or group dynamics right down to individual choices you're going to make with upwards of a 99 percentile accuracy rate.
[00:45:45.203 --> 00:45:48.965]  So it's also about imitating God.
[00:45:48.965 --> 00:45:50.326]  They want to control the weather.
[00:45:50.326 --> 00:45:51.167]  They openly say this.
[00:45:51.167 --> 00:45:53.569]  They want to control reproduction.
[00:45:53.569 --> 00:46:00.474]  They want to be able to control all of the agrarian farming and ranching that's going on.
[00:46:00.474 --> 00:46:02.156]  They want to be able to have omnipresence
[00:46:02.916 --> 00:46:03.216]  I think?
[00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:34.577]  Tools in the hands of these people that tyrants like Hitler and Stalin and Mao could only dream of, or probably couldn't even dream of.
[00:46:34.577 --> 00:46:44.544]  And that's why I have the website PrisonPlanet.com, because in the elite's own statements they say they are creating a giant worldwide prison
[00:46:45.345 --> 00:46:49.088]  And the final equation, world government is only the beginning.
[00:46:49.088 --> 00:47:04.258]  Once they have it in place, they will then stop just beta testing cancer viruses and vaccines and sodium fluoride and other poisons in the water and all the major GMO crops in every study, sterilizing the rodents and other lab animals that it's tested on.
[00:47:04.258 --> 00:47:11.943]  They will then accelerate from soft kill to hard kill and kill at least 80% of the world's population.
[00:47:12.674 --> 00:47:13.154]  Well, that's right.
[00:47:13.154 --> 00:47:16.497]  This agenda is so vast, it's almost mind-boggling.
[00:47:16.497 --> 00:47:19.719]  And as vast as it is, it's also that ambitious.
[00:47:19.719 --> 00:47:26.725]  So, what do you see as the time frame for implementation of this cashless society?
[00:47:26.725 --> 00:47:33.550]  I've seen statistics of already over 90% of purchases in Europe are digital, cashless.
[00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:39.475]  Upwards of 90% in Asia, in Japan, in South Korea, in the major cities of China.
[00:47:42.043 --> 00:48:00.120]  It's close to that in the United States and they're running PSAs on television worldwide demonizing cash as if it's dirty and bad because once the cashless grid is in place then the bankers can completely abandon any connection to reality and instead of having fractional reserve banking
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:09.192]  For every dollar or every yen or yon or euro that the banks have, they can loan out $10 of money that doesn't exist.
[00:48:09.192 --> 00:48:15.441]  Now they can take that derivatives model of unlimited digital money and
[00:48:16.362 --> 00:48:20.825]  Really expand their monopoly of power over currency and credit and take over the whole planet.
[00:48:20.825 --> 00:48:23.027]  So we're basically already there.
[00:48:23.027 --> 00:48:27.590]  They're just beta testing final pieces of it.
[00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:35.035]  And by 2015, unless people resist, we will be locked into a cashless society control grid, similar to the no-fly list.
[00:48:35.035 --> 00:48:42.381]  I saw Governor Ridge seven years ago, the new head of Homeland Security when it was first funded, as a cabinet position, say,
[00:48:43.061 --> 00:48:47.304]  That if you're not in good favor with the government, your national ID card will be turned off.
[00:48:47.304 --> 00:48:48.464]  You won't be able to work.
[00:48:48.464 --> 00:48:50.666]  So the no-fly will be a no-work.
[00:48:50.666 --> 00:48:52.026]  You won't be able to own a gun.
[00:48:52.026 --> 00:48:54.668]  There's no judge, no jury, no due process.
[00:48:54.668 --> 00:48:56.849]  You're just put on these lists.
[00:48:56.849 --> 00:49:00.531]  And they can put whatever disinformation they want in these databases.
[00:49:00.531 --> 00:49:01.852]  And so we're basically there.
[00:49:01.852 --> 00:49:09.417]  It just gets worse and worse as we go further downhill into what can only be described as a
[00:49:12.719 --> 00:49:12.979]  I think so.
[00:49:28.015 --> 00:49:39.457]  The Unified Treaties on Global Standardization for IDs have a thumbprint, a handprint, and a face print all rolled into one on the ID.
[00:49:39.457 --> 00:49:44.538]  Let he who has understanding reckon the number of the beast, for it is a human number.
[00:49:44.538 --> 00:49:47.238]  It's numbered as 666.
[00:49:47.238 --> 00:49:48.819]  What is a human number?
[00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:55.360]  It is a biometric number calculated off of characteristics that are individual to each person.
[00:49:56.394 --> 00:49:56.775]  That's right.
[00:49:56.775 --> 00:50:03.745]  Well, just in the last minute or two we have left, you mentioned that unless people resist, it's probably going to be in place, locked into place by 2015.
[00:50:03.745 --> 00:50:07.692]  So what are some points of resistance and ways people can fight against this agenda?
[00:50:09.738 --> 00:50:12.580]  We need to expand our barter community.
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:33.375]  Even if you live in a city, you can raise fish, you can grow small crops, you can start bartering with your neighbors, try to use cash as much as you can, get your money out of big mega banks like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and other big mega banks that are part of this cartel, support local
[00:50:34.082 --> 00:50:39.626]  You can go to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and watch the rest of the interview.
[00:50:39.626 --> 00:50:45.870]  We're going to come back and get into Greenpeace to global warming skeptics.
[00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:47.632]  We know where you live.
[00:50:47.632 --> 00:50:50.093]  A new phase.
[00:50:50.093 --> 00:50:59.080]  Now they always intended to get violent and they've actually been violent, the environmental groups, but now they're throwing a fit and saying they're going to get physically revolutionary.
[00:51:00.615 --> 00:51:04.756]  How would you like to own a pair of the most unique gloves in the world?

[00:52:00.494 --> 00:52:02.794]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:02.794 --> 00:52:05.175]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.175 --> 00:52:08.396]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.396 --> 00:52:13.497]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:17.698]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:17.998 --> 00:52:20.459]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.459 --> 00:52:22.900]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:26.142]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.142 --> 00:52:33.745]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.085 --> 00:52:39.487]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.487 --> 00:52:41.788]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.788 --> 00:52:46.029]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.029 --> 00:52:47.110]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:48.430]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:49.931]  Invisible Empire.

[00:53:00.144 --> 00:53:01.865]  Oh, my sinuses!
[00:53:01.865 --> 00:53:03.826]  They feel like they'll explode!
[00:53:03.826 --> 00:53:04.626]  Sinus pressure.
[00:53:04.626 --> 00:53:06.407]  Sinus headaches that keep you up at night.
[00:53:06.407 --> 00:53:07.648]  You've struggled for years.
[00:53:07.648 --> 00:53:13.511]  You've tried everything to get relief, but your sinus distress just keeps coming back and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.
[00:53:13.511 --> 00:53:14.271]  Sound familiar?
[00:53:14.271 --> 00:53:15.312]  Well, you're not alone.
[00:53:15.312 --> 00:53:18.954]  Statistics show that 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress.
[00:53:18.954 --> 00:53:23.776]  Fact is, 67 products merely treat the symptoms and don't get to the cause of your sinus problem.

[00:54:17.168 --> 00:54:17.388]  Okay.
[00:54:33.627 --> 00:54:43.413]  I'm going to get into this whole environmental cult funded by the big banks and what they're driving for as we start the next hour.
[00:54:43.413 --> 00:54:49.296]  I want to give the toll-free number out for callers to call in on any issues they wish to discuss.
[00:54:49.296 --> 00:54:50.077]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:50.077 --> 00:54:50.117]  800-259-9231.
[00:54:59.685 --> 00:55:17.508]  There's also been some important new developments, only further confirming what we already knew, that the five-state militia raids were provocateured and staged to create the perception that there are all these right-wing terrorists out there, so when the government stages more terror attacks, they can be blamed on the American people.
[00:55:19.104 --> 00:55:20.245]  We're going to be going over that.
[00:55:20.245 --> 00:55:31.019]  Also, we're hearing about some of the people that Obama wants to nominate for the two Supreme Court vacancies that are set to be developed in the next year.
[00:55:32.244 --> 00:55:35.945]  With Ruth Bader Ginsburg and, of course, Justice Stevens.
[00:55:35.945 --> 00:55:38.346]  We're going to get into open discussion of the U.S.
[00:55:38.346 --> 00:55:43.608]  losing its AAA rating bond and what that will mean to our society.
[00:55:43.608 --> 00:55:47.989]  Also, Obama says Beck Limbaugh fueled troublesome political climate.
[00:55:47.989 --> 00:55:48.590]  This is out of AP.
[00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:56.172]  Of course, he did that CBS interview last week.
[00:55:56.172 --> 00:56:01.054]  We're going to talk about that today as well.
[00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:09.232]  And get into several other stacks of important news that I haven't even begun to mention yet.
[00:56:09.232 --> 00:56:13.414]  More on the government takeover of health care as well.
[00:56:13.414 --> 00:56:24.679]  But as I start the second hour, I will, in two segments, break down the environmental cult that is taking over and running our society.
[00:56:25.763 --> 00:56:34.366]  Also, I just want to encourage listeners and fellow info warriors out there to not be depressed by everything that's happening.
[00:56:34.366 --> 00:56:43.790]  This just proves that those of us that were concerned who studied history, those of us that had studied the elites that are in control of our society, have been correct.
[00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:46.531]  And so this evil was already there.
[00:56:46.531 --> 00:56:48.611]  It was already quietly taking over.
[00:56:48.611 --> 00:56:52.553]  Now it's more in the open because we're very late in the game.
[00:56:54.602 --> 00:57:03.641]  But the time for denial is over and everyone I talk to is seeing people wake up who laughed at them when they warned them about world government years ago.
[00:57:05.202 --> 00:57:09.845]  And so I just want to encourage listeners out there to continue to spread the word.
[00:57:09.845 --> 00:57:14.667]  That's the number one thing is that people be aware of the type of enemy we face.
[00:57:14.667 --> 00:57:16.528]  Knowing is half the battle.
[00:57:16.528 --> 00:57:18.349]  To use a cheesy G.I.
[00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:25.333]  Joe line, but that actually goes back to World War II when they said knowing who your enemy is and where they are is half the battle.
[00:57:25.333 --> 00:57:26.374]  The rest is initiative.
[00:57:26.894 --> 00:57:31.318]  Well, a lot of people are ready to be awakened, but they're not awakened yet.
[00:57:31.318 --> 00:57:33.720]  And so it is so vital to wake people up.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:43.288]  And whether you tell folks about the free Apple iPhone or iPad Touch app at InfoWars.com, even if you don't have an iPhone, you can send it to friends and family that do.
[00:57:43.288 --> 00:57:44.289]  You tell people about the free podcast.
[00:57:44.349 --> 00:57:44.729]  I don't
[00:58:05.811 --> 00:58:07.952]  Spread the word and educate others.
[00:58:07.952 --> 00:58:11.434]  Whether it's Endgame, The Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, they're all vital.
[00:58:11.434 --> 00:58:18.258]  Two new films coming out this month, one in ten days, will premiere at PrisonPlanet.tv for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:58:18.258 --> 00:58:21.180]  That is Invisible Empire and New World Order Defined.
[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:24.022]  Such an important film you can give anybody and they'll have
[00:58:24.642 --> 00:58:26.103]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:58.474]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:58:58.474 --> 00:59:03.581]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:59:03.581 --> 00:59:07.767]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:59:08.067 --> 00:59:10.548]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:59:10.548 --> 00:59:13.310]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:59:13.310 --> 00:59:16.212]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:59:16.212 --> 00:59:23.816]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.

[00:59:37.162 --> 00:59:38.503]  You're everyone else.

[00:59:55.839 --> 01:00:05.328]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.328 --> 01:00:05.929]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.648 --> 01:00:08.411]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.411 --> 01:00:10.153]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.153 --> 01:00:11.735]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.735 --> 01:00:13.317]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.317 --> 01:00:17.503]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.503 --> 01:00:21.568]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.994 --> 01:00:31.696]  I'm going to go ahead and take a few calls in this short segment and then when we start the next segment I'm going to try to cover this all in one segment.
[01:00:31.696 --> 01:00:32.937]  Very important information.
[01:00:32.937 --> 01:00:35.177]  Greenpeace to global warming skeptics.
[01:00:35.177 --> 01:00:36.718]  We know where you live.
[01:00:36.718 --> 01:00:40.099]  And how that ties into leaked UN documents.
[01:00:40.099 --> 01:00:42.940]  Real plan for green world order by 2012.
[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:46.861]  Top eco-fascist calls for end of freedom to fight global warming.
[01:00:48.208 --> 01:00:54.293]  It all gives you a very interesting picture about the mindset of the people we're up against and their authoritarian nature.
[01:00:54.293 --> 01:00:56.315]  I mean, they admit they want authoritarianism.
[01:00:56.315 --> 01:00:58.457]  They're calling for tyranny.
[01:00:58.457 --> 01:01:00.879]  It doesn't get any clearer and cut and dry than that.
[01:01:00.879 --> 01:01:03.762]  We're fighting tyrants, period.
[01:01:03.762 --> 01:01:06.044]  Michael in California, you're on the air.
[01:01:06.044 --> 01:01:07.725]  Wow, I'm first up?
[01:01:07.725 --> 01:01:09.126]  You've got to be kidding me.
[01:01:09.126 --> 01:01:09.847]  I just called.
[01:01:09.847 --> 01:01:14.811]  Anyway, Alex, some strange things happened to me.
[01:01:15.970 --> 01:01:29.212]  First part of March after I started writing a book, I discovered something monitoring a Google Maps satellite that blew my mind.
[01:01:29.212 --> 01:01:38.034]  Okay, I'm trying to send you the photo as we speak on prison planet support.
[01:01:38.034 --> 01:01:45.335]  Okay, anyway, me and a buddy of mine, we monitor earthquakes and we were observing faults
[01:01:46.408 --> 01:01:58.513]  And I was going up along the west coast of California, following that Cascadia fault line, and I just kept going, and it started shooting west towards Alaska.
[01:01:58.513 --> 01:02:06.937]  And I get past the Horn of Alaska, and there's a stinger of a scorpion staring me right in the face on the bottom of the ocean floor.
[01:02:06.937 --> 01:02:13.660]  So what I did was I zoomed out, and to my astonishment, all the beasts
[01:02:14.753 --> 01:02:19.103]  Written in prophecy in the Bible are painted on the ocean floor.
[01:02:23.792 --> 01:02:27.673]  Well, I'll tell you what, send that to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[01:02:27.673 --> 01:02:35.694]  That's not really what we cover here on the show, you know, smoke in the towers that show the devil or things like that, but I'll take a look at it.
[01:02:35.694 --> 01:02:43.476]  I know in architecture, they, you know, barracks that are swastikas and pyramids and that the elite are obsessed with numerology and architecture.
[01:02:43.476 --> 01:02:46.476]  We've had some professors on to cover that.
[01:02:46.476 --> 01:02:48.517]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eric in Oregon.
[01:02:48.517 --> 01:02:49.197]  Eric, you're on the air.
[01:02:51.212 --> 01:02:52.913]  Hey, Alex, thanks for everything you're doing.
[01:02:52.913 --> 01:02:58.395]  You're making me really inspired to do whatever I can to make the most effort to help everyone we can.
[01:02:58.395 --> 01:02:59.436]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:02:59.436 --> 01:03:01.077]  Yeah, you're welcome.
[01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:16.004]  One thing you were saying recently was about the Green World Order, and before that article came up with the UN releasing that, I had seen a hemp company that was promoting this Green World Order thing, and I'm, like, really following all these companies and seeing who's actually legitimate.
[01:03:16.004 --> 01:03:18.565]  A lot of companies come from China and stuff like that.
[01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:19.668]  We're good.
[01:03:32.921 --> 01:03:36.063]  Yeah, well that's George Soros.
[01:03:36.063 --> 01:03:37.164]  That's George Soros.
[01:03:37.164 --> 01:03:43.849]  I mean, just because Soros wants marijuana decriminalization doesn't mean that marijuana decriminalization is a bad thing.
[01:03:43.849 --> 01:03:49.233]  It means he knows that if 87% of the American people have smoked or do smoke marijuana,
[01:03:49.793 --> 01:03:54.677]  That it's going to end up being decriminalized and he wants to make sure he controls that movement.
[01:03:54.677 --> 01:03:59.762]  And so absolutely, it's just full of government and foundation infiltrators.
[01:03:59.762 --> 01:04:01.663]  But that's going to happen with anything.
[01:04:01.663 --> 01:04:03.425]  That's why the globalists are in control.
[01:04:03.425 --> 01:04:05.847]  They always try to control all sides of any debate.
[01:04:06.889 --> 01:04:18.497]  Well, so the hemp movement is trying to be taken over, so if they actually legalize it one day, they'll have all the companies in place to have all the hemp plastic, the hemp wood, the hemp construction, so that one day, if people are doing it... Exactly!
[01:04:18.497 --> 01:04:31.025]  It was big companies 80 years ago, DuPont and Dow Chemical, that got hemp banned, even the varieties that have no THC, because it was better than their polyester, it was better than cotton, it was better for oils, you can grow it anywhere.
[01:04:31.025 --> 01:04:34.567]  It's a great crop, that's why George Washington grew it.
[01:04:34.567 --> 01:04:36.809]  Great points, appreciate the call, Eric.
[01:04:37.709 --> 01:04:41.211]  Ernie, Steve, Herman, Brian and others.
[01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:42.652]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:04:42.652 --> 01:04:43.572]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:43.572 --> 01:04:48.394]  I'm gonna get into the Green World Order straight ahead.
[01:04:48.394 --> 01:04:51.215]  Don't forget, April!
[01:04:51.215 --> 01:04:55.057]  We're launching two different Info Weapon Salvos at the end of May.
[01:04:55.057 --> 01:04:57.218]  How big an effect they have is up to you.
[01:04:57.218 --> 01:04:58.759]  Two new films in the month of April.
[01:05:00.626 --> 01:05:01.927]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:01.927 --> 01:05:07.513]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:05:07.513 --> 01:05:12.538]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:05:12.538 --> 01:05:17.584]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:05:18.104 --> 01:05:23.328]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:05:23.328 --> 01:05:25.630]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:30.434]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:05:30.434 --> 01:05:31.575]  And here's the best part.
[01:05:31.575 --> 01:05:34.637]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:05:34.637 --> 01:05:37.920]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:41.422]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:41.422 --> 01:05:43.643]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:43.643 --> 01:05:44.503]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:05:44.503 --> 01:05:44.743]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:05:44.743 --> 01:05:48.225]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:05:48.225 --> 01:05:49.966]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:06:00.465 --> 01:06:05.792]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:06:05.792 --> 01:06:08.536]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:06:08.536 --> 01:06:12.922]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:06:15.265 --> 01:06:18.327]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.
[01:06:18.327 --> 01:06:23.350]  We also have some specials when you get some of our other films half price when you order Shadow Government.
[01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:26.432]  A new level in production quality and in information.
[01:06:26.432 --> 01:06:34.497]  It exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[01:06:34.497 --> 01:06:36.359]  This film needs to be seen.
[01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:37.519]  Everybody needs to get it.

[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:42.623]  Show it to your friends, your family, your church, your neighbors, your boss, your employees.
[01:06:44.062 --> 01:06:45.684]  Shadow Government, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:06:48.307 --> 01:06:49.709]  Shadow Government.
[01:06:49.709 --> 01:06:51.932]  It gives Big Brother a black eye.
[01:06:51.932 --> 01:06:55.196]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:10.007]  Thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[01:07:10.007 --> 01:07:11.329]  My name is Crystal.
[01:07:11.329 --> 01:07:14.271]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[01:07:14.271 --> 01:07:18.235]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:07:18.235 --> 01:07:22.198]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:07:22.358 --> 01:07:23.199]  What did Crystal do?
[01:07:23.199 --> 01:07:27.144]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[01:07:27.144 --> 01:07:33.553]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[01:07:33.553 --> 01:07:37.398]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.
[01:07:37.398 --> 01:07:39.941]  Learn more at HBextract.com or call 866-293-7000.
[01:07:40.882 --> 01:07:41.642]  We're good to go.
[01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:09.121]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.121 --> 01:08:16.187]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.187 --> 01:08:23.613]  The United Nations, the Club of Rome, Bill Gates, Ted Turner,
[01:08:24.639 --> 01:08:27.362]  The head climatologist at NASA.
[01:08:27.362 --> 01:08:37.974]  Thousands of prominent environmentalists are on record saying they want a organized authoritarian world economy run by them.
[01:08:37.974 --> 01:08:39.375]  It is about feudalism.
[01:08:39.375 --> 01:08:40.917]  It is about serfdom.
[01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:43.440]  It is about dominating humanity.
[01:08:44.625 --> 01:08:49.332]  Deciding who can have a business, who can have a job, where you can have a factory.
[01:08:49.332 --> 01:08:54.339]  And they've chosen carbon dioxide, one of the four life-giving elements on Earth.
[01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:57.984]  Carbon dioxide, oxygen, water and sunlight.
[01:08:57.984 --> 01:08:59.487]  That is the carbon cycle.
[01:09:00.555 --> 01:09:03.776]  They're not stopping cross-species genetic engineering.
[01:09:03.776 --> 01:09:08.118]  They're not stopping the superconducting supercollider at Hadron.
[01:09:08.118 --> 01:09:12.859]  They're not stopping the development of antimatter weapons.
[01:09:12.859 --> 01:09:17.661]  No, the elite are rushing in their attempt to be as gods.
[01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:33.804]  They have created high-tech government and private industry reservations that are, in many cases, 30 years advanced in the technology that the general public is privy to.
[01:09:33.804 --> 01:09:39.526]  An example, the government now admits they've had highly advanced space planes for over 30 years.
[01:09:39.526 --> 01:09:44.348]  NASA, just over the weekend, started showing some of the vehicles to the public.
[01:09:46.872 --> 01:09:53.175]  We'll be talking about that later when we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:09:53.175 --> 01:09:56.376]  The public is given mindless issues to be concerned with.
[01:09:56.376 --> 01:09:58.977]  Fashion, sports, things that don't matter.
[01:09:58.977 --> 01:10:03.860]  Their minds are filled with pointless trivia.
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:11.043]  Meanwhile, a cult of eugenicists is in control of our society.
[01:10:13.584 --> 01:10:24.381]  As the public begins to wake up to the fact that the greenhouse gas taxes are about controlling society, controlling industry with selective enforcement, taxing and regulating our lives.
[01:10:26.824 --> 01:10:46.940]  As world government has openly announced and we're told that indeed a private cartel of banks rule the planet, people are waking up as they see the climate gate emails, as they learn about systemic organized system-wide fraud between the UN and major universities and major governments.
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:49.762]  The people are waking up and saying no.
[01:10:54.758 --> 01:11:02.705]  Now we know that for a long time in internal Club of Rome, UN documents, Pentagon documents, that in many cases aren't even classified.
[01:11:02.705 --> 01:11:06.629]  They're just not widely distributed or published or covered on the news.
[01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:09.472]  We've known this is an authoritarian tyranny.
[01:11:09.472 --> 01:11:11.734]  We've known this.
[01:11:11.734 --> 01:11:20.722]  But now every day I see articles written and distributed by the leaders of what is known as the environmental movement.
[01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:30.548]  Openly saying they are setting up tyranny and that it will be authoritarian and that you will have no choice.
[01:11:30.548 --> 01:11:41.063]  And that they need to come out in the open and physically bully the people of the planet and ignore the will of the population of the planet.
[01:11:43.396 --> 01:11:45.738]  Greenpeace to global warming skeptics.
[01:11:45.738 --> 01:11:47.300]  We know where you live.
[01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:49.161]  Prisonplanet.com.
[01:11:49.161 --> 01:11:54.006]  Links to the mainstream articles and links to Greenpeace where they have articles openly stating it.
[01:11:54.006 --> 01:11:59.951]  An article carried by the official Greenpeace website written by a Greenpeace member urges climate alarmist
[01:12:00.692 --> 01:12:01.873]  They're climate terrorists.
[01:12:01.873 --> 01:12:07.119]  Oh, the seas will rise, you will all die if you don't give us money and let us run your lives.
[01:12:07.119 --> 01:12:18.212]  An article carried by the official Greenpeace website written by a Greenpeace member urges climate activists to resort to criminal activity in an effort to reinvigorate momentum.
[01:12:19.013 --> 01:12:25.297]  For their stalling global warming agenda while ominously threatening climate skeptics, we know where you live.
[01:12:25.297 --> 01:12:26.357]  That's a quote.
[01:12:26.357 --> 01:12:38.444]  The article written by Greenpeace activist Jean from India calls for mass civil disobedience to cut off the financial oxygen from denial and skepticism.
[01:12:38.444 --> 01:12:41.886]  Not allowed to be skeptical, not allowed to catch them in fraud.
[01:12:41.886 --> 01:12:44.307]  Notice they say cut off the oxygen.
[01:12:44.307 --> 01:12:46.068]  Well, you do cut off the carbon dioxide.
[01:12:46.068 --> 01:12:47.229]  That does cut off the oxygen.
[01:12:48.303 --> 01:12:58.774]  Gene then has a special message for roughly half of Americans who, in the wake of the Climategate scandal, are now skeptical of man-made global warming.
[01:12:58.774 --> 01:13:06.782]  Quote, we know where you are, we know where you live, we know where you work, and we be many, but you be few.
[01:13:08.476 --> 01:13:19.027]  And I've talked about how if you park your SUV at City Parks in Austin, and this is many other areas of the country, they will slash your tires, key your car, bash your windows out.
[01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:22.952]  You go to Zilker Park, it's just covered with glass, the parking lots.
[01:13:22.952 --> 01:13:28.758]  My car's been keyed, I've been there driving a smaller vehicle and seen windows that were freshly bashed out.
[01:13:28.758 --> 01:13:30.300]  It is just an orgy of evil.
[01:13:32.972 --> 01:13:40.332]  And now they're creating the Green Police and hiring these control freaks to be turned loose on the population and having Audi commercials to show you exactly what they're already doing in Europe.
[01:13:41.892 --> 01:13:50.157]  Gene quotes another climate activist who calls for an army of greenies to break the law and take retribution against anyone who stands in their way.
[01:13:50.157 --> 01:13:52.058]  The politicians have failed.
[01:13:52.058 --> 01:13:53.740]  Now it's up to us.
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:57.022]  We must break the law to make the laws we need.
[01:13:57.022 --> 01:14:00.964]  Laws that are supposed to protect society and protect our future.
[01:14:00.964 --> 01:14:04.246]  Until our laws do that, screw being climate lobbyists.
[01:14:04.246 --> 01:14:06.408]  Screw being climate activists.
[01:14:06.408 --> 01:14:07.448]  It's not working.
[01:14:07.448 --> 01:14:09.930]  We need an army of climate outlaws.
[01:14:11.721 --> 01:14:24.286]  Greenpeace has not issued a retraction of the comments, preferring instead to buffer the blog at both beginning and end with desperate sounding explanations, insisting that the author has peaceful intentions.
[01:14:24.286 --> 01:14:27.587]  The organization has obviously been taking a hammering for this.
[01:14:31.423 --> 01:14:34.446]  As it worsens their public relations disaster.
[01:14:34.446 --> 01:14:44.455]  This is by no means the first time global warming adherents have resorted to physical threats in an effort to bolster their rapidly crumbling credibility on climate change issues.
[01:14:44.455 --> 01:14:55.405]  In June last year, a global warming activist posted an article on the Talking Points of MO website entitled, At What Point Do We Jail or Execute Global Warming Deniers?
[01:14:56.653 --> 01:15:14.321]  Shortly after the article was retracted, a comment traced back to another prominent global warming activist, which appeared on the Climate Progress blog, threatened skeptics that an entire generation will soon be ready to strangle you and your kind while you sleep on your beds.
[01:15:14.321 --> 01:15:21.925]  Website owner Joe Rom defended the comments as clearly not a threat, but a prediction.
[01:15:21.925 --> 01:15:23.926]  For years, climate skeptics have
[01:15:25.256 --> 01:15:27.298]  Is this really the kind of caring, sensitive message
[01:15:54.073 --> 01:15:59.154]  This charity ought to be conveying to the world, asks James Dillingpole.
[01:15:59.154 --> 01:16:01.175]  Not to judge by the comments below.
[01:16:01.175 --> 01:16:03.796]  Happy Easter Greenpeace PR department.
[01:16:03.796 --> 01:16:07.337]  I think you're going to have a busy next few days.
[01:16:07.337 --> 01:16:18.640]  As a recent psychological science study highlighted, warmists tend not to adhere to the caring, sensitive image they portray when it comes to their own private lives.
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.080]  The study
[01:16:20.322 --> 01:16:29.379]  Was actually pushed by pro warmness and they thought it would show they were more loving and show they're six times more likely to steal if they hate their fellow man.
[01:16:29.379 --> 01:16:29.780]  Those who...
[01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:43.319]  Those who wear what the authors call the halo of green consumerism are less likely to be kind to others and more likely to cheat and steal, summarizes the Telegraph's Ian Hollingshed.
[01:16:43.319 --> 01:16:56.326]  Faced with various moral choices, whether to stick to the rules and games, for example, or to pay themselves an appropriate wage, the green participants behaved much worse in the experiments than their conventional counterparts.
[01:16:56.326 --> 01:17:00.468]  The short answer to the paper's question is, no, greens are mean.
[01:17:02.011 --> 01:17:08.416]  Despite Greenpeace's efforts at damage control, there can be little doubt as to the true context of the article.
[01:17:08.416 --> 01:17:19.544]  By first encouraging climate activists to break the law in pursuit of their stalling political agenda, Jean has greased the skids for criminal activity, concluding that
[01:17:20.953 --> 01:17:35.620]  Threats to climate skeptics that we know where you live is clearly a form of intimidation and an invitation for a quote army of climate outlaws to take physical retribution against people who disagree with them.
[01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:41.763]  Imagine if Infowars.com put out an article urging its readers to break the law in order to combat the IRS.
[01:17:41.763 --> 01:17:42.664]  Imagine if we told
[01:17:45.385 --> 01:17:47.587]  IRS agents, we know where you live.
[01:17:47.587 --> 01:17:54.753]  We'd be raided quicker than a heartbeat, and Alex Jones would be demonized all over the establishment media as a dangerous extremist.
[01:17:54.753 --> 01:18:07.683]  Indeed, a mere peaceful letter-writing campaign urging governors to resign was leapt upon by the media and the federal government this past week as a concerning portent of extremist threat.
[01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:08.904]  Some capitals were locked down.
[01:18:11.164 --> 01:18:19.049]  An extremist threat posed by constitutionalists despite the fact that there was no indication of violence.
[01:18:19.049 --> 01:18:26.673]  When so-called right-wingers or libertarians merely write letters urging peaceful political change, they are demonized as terrorist hate-mongers.
[01:18:26.673 --> 01:18:33.117]  But when Greenies openly call for criminal behavior, allied with thinly-veiled threats of physical violence, it's no big deal.
[01:18:34.008 --> 01:18:42.853]  Will CNN and MSNBC devote weeks of endless coverage to Greenpeace's threats towards people they disagree with?
[01:18:42.853 --> 01:18:50.038]  There's more chance of Keith Oberman awarding Representative Hank Johnson, a major global warming adherent, his worst person in the world,
[01:18:51.274 --> 01:18:59.342]  Going for hilariously warning that the island of Guam could capsize like a boat due to overpopulation.
[01:18:59.342 --> 01:19:01.684]  Now, I read that article in full.
[01:19:01.684 --> 01:19:12.334]  When we come back, I want to back it up with just a few articles we printed this morning from the last few weeks with what leaders of other major environmental organizations are calling for.
[01:19:14.286 --> 01:19:19.773]  And tie it in with leaked UN document reveals plan for Green World Order by 2012.
[01:19:19.773 --> 01:19:27.382]  When we return, top eco-fascist calls for end of freedom to fight global warming.
[01:19:27.382 --> 01:19:33.029]  Population reduction enthusiast says a few people with authority should run the planet.
[01:19:33.630 --> 01:19:36.952]  And an authoritarian system is now needed.
[01:19:36.952 --> 01:19:40.974]  This environmental movement is authoritarian from its beginnings.
[01:19:40.974 --> 01:19:42.255]  It is oppressive.
[01:19:42.255 --> 01:19:46.317]  It is anti-human and anti-environment.
[01:19:46.317 --> 01:19:48.038]  They are eugenicists.
[01:19:48.038 --> 01:19:54.462]  It is covered in my seminal film, End Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:19:54.462 --> 01:19:58.744]  We'll break it down, the threat to all of us, on the other side.
[01:19:58.744 --> 01:19:59.264]  Stay with us.
[01:20:01.604 --> 01:20:06.228]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[01:20:06.228 --> 01:20:14.014]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey Guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.

[01:21:01.471 --> 01:21:02.613]  What's your home worth?
[01:21:02.613 --> 01:21:04.735]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:21:04.735 --> 01:21:07.779]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:21:07.779 --> 01:21:15.509]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[01:21:15.509 --> 01:21:18.953]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[01:21:35.730 --> 01:21:38.833]  HomeGain.com has an A-plus rating with the Better Business Bureau.
[01:21:39.013 --> 01:21:39.233]  I think so.
[01:22:00.814 --> 01:22:10.842]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:22:10.842 --> 01:22:17.287]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:22:17.287 --> 01:22:26.134]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:22:26.494 --> 01:22:35.679]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:22:35.679 --> 01:22:40.282]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:22:40.282 --> 01:22:42.083]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:44.584]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[01:22:44.864 --> 01:22:48.187]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.187 --> 01:22:52.371]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[01:22:52.371 --> 01:22:53.132]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.132 --> 01:22:53.472]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.834 --> 01:23:06.661]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease begins in the colon?
[01:23:06.661 --> 01:23:11.887]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[01:23:11.887 --> 01:23:14.730]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[01:23:14.730 --> 01:23:20.497]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat, but also a healthy digestive system and a strong immune system.
[01:23:20.717 --> 01:23:29.868]  At Freshwater Organics, we offer FPP, a daily organic supplement that helps eliminate parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely.
[01:23:29.868 --> 01:23:37.377]  FPP, or fossilized phytoplankton powder, has been used worldwide for thousands of uses and is now available from Freshwater Organics.
[01:23:37.577 --> 01:23:44.998]  In addition, we offer an entire line of products to help cleanse waste and toxins, strengthen your immune system, and improve your overall well-being.
[01:23:44.998 --> 01:23:50.539]  Make FreshWaterOrganics.com your first stop for organic and natural supplements at the best prices.
[01:23:50.539 --> 01:23:52.660]  Visit FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:55.000]  Again, that's FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.880]  Or request your free catalog by mail by calling 888-949-3570.
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:06.662]  The name of the game with the Green Tyrants.
[01:24:09.286 --> 01:24:23.717]  Is control of resources, control of your life, making you dependent on them, making you get government health care, where they ration the care, where they decide what treatments you can get openly to reduce world population.
[01:24:23.717 --> 01:24:30.622]  But it's so horrifying, it's so evil, the average person who's good can't imagine this is happening.
[01:24:33.427 --> 01:24:42.453]  Remember last year the headline in the Financial Times of London and now for world government by their foreign news editor where he called for an authoritarian system?
[01:24:42.453 --> 01:24:49.318]  He said, yes, we've been building it in stealth because you're too stupid to realize that you need this.
[01:24:51.493 --> 01:24:54.495]  Well, what did James Lovelock say last week in The Guardian?
[01:24:54.495 --> 01:24:57.396]  Humans are too stupid to prevent climate change.
[01:24:57.396 --> 01:25:10.303]  In his first in-depth interview since the theft of the UEA emails, which the government now has cleared, a one-day inquiry, they say nothing bad happened with ClimateGate, the scientist blames inertia and democracy for lack of action.
[01:25:10.303 --> 01:25:11.104]  That's a quote.
[01:25:11.104 --> 01:25:13.265]  Now, let me read you Paul Watson's detailed article.
[01:25:14.265 --> 01:25:26.396]  On this top eco-fascist calls for end of freedom to fight global warming and we're seeing these calls everywhere and for physical attacks on those of us that expose these eugenicists.
[01:25:26.396 --> 01:25:32.081]  Open violence, open tyranny, open oppression, open calls for an end of freedom.
[01:25:35.185 --> 01:25:36.645]  You understand?
[01:25:36.645 --> 01:25:37.486]  There's no doubt.
[01:25:37.486 --> 01:25:39.286]  The battle lines are drawn here.
[01:25:39.286 --> 01:25:44.328]  And the right wing is controlled by the fake terror paradigm, calling for secret arrest, torture and war.
[01:25:44.328 --> 01:25:45.888]  So they cover the bases.
[01:25:45.888 --> 01:25:53.130]  As the Club of Rome 1991 document said, they'll control the right wing with fake terror, they'll control the left with fake environmentalism.
[01:25:55.319 --> 01:26:12.653]  The renowned environmentalist, known for his advocacy of population reduction as a means of offsetting climate change, has called for a, quote, more authoritative world, authoritarian world, where freedom comes second to tackling what he sees as the devastating effects of global warming.
[01:26:12.653 --> 01:26:15.616]  Futurist James Levlock, who believes the planet has a soul,
[01:26:16.837 --> 01:26:17.918]  That's very futuristic.
[01:26:17.918 --> 01:26:19.258]  No, that's ancient.
[01:26:19.258 --> 01:26:26.943]  Tells the London Guardian that he believes, quote, it may be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while in order to save humanity.
[01:26:26.943 --> 01:26:30.865]  See, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:26:30.865 --> 01:26:33.527]  Two wolves and a sheep is democracy.
[01:26:33.527 --> 01:26:34.527]  We're a republic.
[01:26:34.527 --> 01:26:38.630]  If 99% say kill the 1%, you can't do it in a republic.
[01:26:38.630 --> 01:26:42.832]  So they've tried to push democracy and get 51% to vote for tyranny.
[01:26:42.832 --> 01:26:45.514]  But if they can't get that, they'll just go to open tyranny.
[01:26:45.514 --> 01:26:45.994]  You understand?
[01:26:47.142 --> 01:26:55.271]  I mean, just because you get 51% of people to say, kill anybody with red hair, it doesn't happen.
[01:26:55.271 --> 01:26:59.837]  We need a more authoritative world, Lovelock states, authoritarian.
[01:26:59.837 --> 01:27:05.283]  We've become a sort of cheeky, egalitarian world where everyone can have their say.
[01:27:05.283 --> 01:27:06.344]  This is a quote.
[01:27:06.344 --> 01:27:07.505]  It's all very well.
[01:27:08.288 --> 01:27:17.654]  But there are certain circumstances, a war is a typical example, where you can't do that, the 90-year-old proponent of the Gaia Hypothesis adds.
[01:27:17.654 --> 01:27:22.197]  You've got to have a few people with authority who you trust who are running it.
[01:27:22.197 --> 01:27:24.278]  Oh, a few people, like him.
[01:27:24.278 --> 01:27:30.342]  And they should be very accountable to, of course, oh, very accountable authoritarians.
[01:27:30.342 --> 01:27:32.824]  But it can't happen in modern democracy.
[01:27:32.824 --> 01:27:34.324]  This is one of the problems.
[01:27:34.324 --> 01:27:34.945]  I'm still quoting.
[01:27:36.158 --> 01:27:37.840]  What's the alternative to democracy?
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:38.901]  There isn't one.
[01:27:38.901 --> 01:27:52.976]  But even the best democracies agree that when the climate change may be an issue as severe as war, it may be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while until you're brainwashed to vote the way they want.
[01:27:52.976 --> 01:27:54.077]  Lovelock concludes.
[01:27:55.185 --> 01:28:00.808]  Which people with authority could Lovelock have in mind for his tyrannical takeover in the name of Mother Earth?
[01:28:00.808 --> 01:28:10.574]  Certainly not the disgraced UN-affiliated climate scientist whose involvement in several recent scandals even Lovelock admits is reprehensible.
[01:28:13.302 --> 01:28:19.383]  Fudging the data in any way whatsoever is quite literally a sin against the Holy Ghost of science.
[01:28:19.383 --> 01:28:23.824]  I'm not religious, but I put it that way because I feel so strongly.
[01:28:23.824 --> 01:28:26.744]  It's the one thing you do not ever do.
[01:28:26.744 --> 01:28:29.745]  You've got to have standards, he states in the interview.
[01:28:29.745 --> 01:28:31.565]  Like authoritarianism?
[01:28:31.565 --> 01:28:42.547]  Lovelock also has little faith in renewable energies, carbon trading, or cap-and-trade schemes, which he previously told the New Scientist are verging on a gigantic scam.
[01:28:44.104 --> 01:28:45.625]  Well, your whole thing is a scam.
[01:28:45.625 --> 01:28:47.205]  I mean, what do you expect?
[01:28:47.205 --> 01:28:52.927]  Lovelock repeats this sentiment in the latest interview with The Guardian, and he goes on to say it's a fraud.
[01:28:52.927 --> 01:29:09.953]  So perhaps Lovelock would point to his friends at the Opium, excuse me, Optimum Population Trust, who we've had on, a notorious UK-based public policy group that campaigns for a gradual decline in the global human population to what it sees as a sustainable level.
[01:29:11.519 --> 01:29:24.309]  Lovelock became a patron of the think tank in 2009 in a statement released by the trust to mark the appointment Lovelock called on the environmental movement as a whole to recognize the truth and speak out.
[01:29:24.309 --> 01:29:35.178]  Then it goes on with all the calls for global government and forced population reduction by different world leaders and organizations.
[01:29:35.178 --> 01:29:36.779]  Now when we come back I'm going to finish up
[01:29:38.424 --> 01:29:44.006]  With how they plan to deploy this authoritarian system and how we need to stop it.
[01:29:44.006 --> 01:29:46.907]  Then your phone calls and I'll get into the latest on the stage.
[01:29:46.907 --> 01:29:51.309]  Militia stings and the economy stay with us.
[01:29:51.309 --> 01:29:52.710]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.710 --> 01:29:55.231]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.231 --> 01:29:57.932]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.223 --> 01:30:04.247]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.247 --> 01:30:09.574]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.574 --> 01:30:11.617]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.617 --> 01:30:16.623]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.623 --> 01:30:17.805]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.805 --> 01:30:18.546]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.906 --> 01:30:20.787]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.787 --> 01:30:21.867]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.867 --> 01:30:24.068]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.068 --> 01:30:25.409]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.409 --> 01:30:26.949]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.949 --> 01:30:32.211]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.211 --> 01:30:35.793]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.793 --> 01:30:39.254]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.614 --> 01:30:40.834]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.834 --> 01:30:41.735]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.735 --> 01:30:42.835]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.835 --> 01:30:43.775]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.775 --> 01:30:44.856]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.856 --> 01:30:47.916]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.916 --> 01:30:50.097]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:50.097 --> 01:30:51.117]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.373 --> 01:31:01.674]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:01.674 --> 01:31:07.259]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:31:07.259 --> 01:31:12.283]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:31:12.283 --> 01:31:17.328]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:31:17.848 --> 01:31:23.071]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:31:23.071 --> 01:31:25.392]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:31:25.392 --> 01:31:30.194]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:31:30.194 --> 01:31:31.315]  And here's the best part.
[01:31:31.315 --> 01:31:34.376]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:31:34.376 --> 01:31:37.658]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:31:37.978 --> 01:31:41.179]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:41.179 --> 01:31:43.400]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:44.340]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:44.740]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:47.981]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:31:47.981 --> 01:31:49.701]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:02.011 --> 01:32:05.974]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:05.974 --> 01:32:14.841]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:14.841 --> 01:32:19.465]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:19.465 --> 01:32:30.294]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:30.914 --> 01:32:40.417]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:40.417 --> 01:32:45.859]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:45.859 --> 01:32:53.342]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:53.342 --> 01:32:56.083]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:01.739 --> 01:33:07.560]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:13.162]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:33:13.162 --> 01:33:15.902]  So what does the Financial Times of London call for?
[01:33:15.902 --> 01:33:21.063]  What does the Guardian call for in its editorial pages?
[01:33:21.063 --> 01:33:23.804]  What does Dr. Eric Bianca at UT call for?
[01:33:23.804 --> 01:33:26.144]  Peter Singer?
[01:33:26.144 --> 01:33:27.605]  Ed Princeton?
[01:33:27.605 --> 01:33:28.145]  Ted Turner?
[01:33:29.025 --> 01:33:33.526]  What does the UN call for in their 1996 Biological Diversity Assessment?
[01:33:33.526 --> 01:33:40.128]  What does the 1973 State Department Memorandum 200 call for?
[01:33:40.128 --> 01:33:52.891]  Just off the top of my head, I could sit here for the next hour rattling off public policy, government official policy, to set up an oppressive planetary state
[01:33:54.423 --> 01:34:07.787]  I'm quoting from Ecoscience, a planetary regime to drug the water, to sterilize the population, to dumb the population down, to put cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[01:34:07.787 --> 01:34:13.609]  Do you think I just get up here and say they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines?
[01:34:13.609 --> 01:34:17.550]  Do you think I just get up here and tell you they're infecting every major vaccine?
[01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:23.912]  It was on CNN two weeks ago that over a million kids got a vaccine with a live pig virus that gives humans cancer in it.
[01:34:25.691 --> 01:34:35.040]  They're giving kids all over the world the HPV shot that kills and maims many and has live cancer virus in it.
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:39.264]  Doesn't protect you.
[01:34:39.264 --> 01:34:40.085]  It's overwhelming.
[01:34:42.165 --> 01:34:44.707]  It's very hard for me to even get up here on the radio more and more.
[01:34:44.707 --> 01:34:52.951]  I mean, I want you to know that this is weighing on me so much that I am not even the person to bring you information that's important.
[01:34:52.951 --> 01:34:54.492]  But who else is doing it?
[01:34:54.492 --> 01:34:55.293]  I don't like it.
[01:34:55.293 --> 01:34:56.514]  I don't enjoy it.
[01:34:56.514 --> 01:34:59.395]  I don't like the fact that I'm here having to cover this.
[01:34:59.395 --> 01:35:01.577]  I can't believe it's so real.
[01:35:01.577 --> 01:35:04.778]  I can't handle the fact that I know it's all real.
[01:35:04.778 --> 01:35:08.881]  I know it's all going on right now and I want it to stop.
[01:35:10.802 --> 01:35:18.647]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of publications the last two years calling for an authoritarian oppressive world government.
[01:35:18.647 --> 01:35:21.810]  They're not denying they're setting up a world government anymore.
[01:35:21.810 --> 01:35:26.473]  They say we're setting it up for your own good and that's the way it is.
[01:35:26.473 --> 01:35:35.859]  And then there's all these well-to-do middle-class people that I see at shopping malls and at restaurants and on the street who laugh at me.
[01:35:35.859 --> 01:35:36.580]  They laugh at me.
[01:35:39.093 --> 01:35:52.721]  Because they're so narcissistic, they're so self-centered, they're so dumbed down, they're only focused on the 10-mile bike ride they're gonna take, or the decathlon they're gonna run, or their mistress they're gonna have sex with, that it's funny.
[01:35:52.721 --> 01:36:01.146]  They just think that it's not their responsibility as men and as women to be involved and informed and standing up against evil.
[01:36:01.146 --> 01:36:02.687]  Now more and more people aren't laughing.
[01:36:02.687 --> 01:36:07.470]  I had several neighbors come up when I was in the front yard this weekend.
[01:36:08.627 --> 01:36:12.909]  and shake my hand and tell me they appreciate what I'm doing.
[01:36:12.909 --> 01:36:18.352]  And I recognize them as neighbors in the last few years that have drawn by, driven by and looked fearfully at me.
[01:36:19.735 --> 01:36:24.598]  But I guess they're starting to realize that it's not Alex Jones that's scary.
[01:36:24.598 --> 01:36:26.259]  It's the information I'm covering.
[01:36:26.259 --> 01:36:27.500]  And you should be concerned.
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:34.925]  You have that fear instinct to get you up off your butt to do something about these people that we face.
[01:36:34.925 --> 01:36:37.066]  I mean, there's no more denial.
[01:36:37.066 --> 01:36:39.167]  They're not lying about the world government anymore.
[01:36:39.167 --> 01:36:42.729]  They're shoving it in your face and saying, we're going to spike your water.
[01:36:42.729 --> 01:36:43.990]  We're going to spike your drugs.
[01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:45.091]  We're going to spike your food.
[01:36:45.091 --> 01:36:46.472]  And we've already been beta testing it.
[01:36:47.932 --> 01:36:56.394]  And we're sitting here in a petri dish, like lab animals, having these experiments done on us, and why can't the cops wake up and join us faster?
[01:36:56.394 --> 01:36:59.334]  Why can't the government bureaucrats wake up to what's happening?
[01:36:59.334 --> 01:37:11.597]  Because they're comfortable, they're on petty power trips, and they don't want to admit what I'm talking about is real, they won't even go research it for themselves, they don't fundamentally care about their family, their children, or their species.
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:16.762]  Because at the core, they don't have respect for themselves.
[01:37:16.762 --> 01:37:22.687]  They don't realize their destiny as a human and the destiny of this species.
[01:37:22.687 --> 01:37:26.971]  Their spirits are corrupt.
[01:37:26.971 --> 01:37:29.433]  That's really what it comes down to.
[01:37:29.433 --> 01:37:36.959]  I mean, if you aren't burning with desire to warn people, burning with desire to learn this information, burning with desire to engage the enemy,
[01:37:40.242 --> 01:37:40.962]  I can't handle it.
[01:37:40.962 --> 01:37:48.924]  I can't handle chills running up and down my spine five, six hours a day.
[01:37:48.924 --> 01:38:00.067]  And then seeing other people who have no idea how perilous this is, no idea how real it is, no idea how there's mountains of just out in the open evidence.
[01:38:03.331 --> 01:38:17.455]  Sure, 10, 15 years ago people talk about a world government plan to use environmentalism to bring in an oppressive police state to then straightjacket society to then carry out an orderly extermination.
[01:38:17.455 --> 01:38:24.097]  But now it's out in the open.
[01:38:24.097 --> 01:38:28.518]  Now it's out in the open.
[01:38:28.518 --> 01:38:31.799]  A green world order, an authoritarian oppression.
[01:38:33.661 --> 01:38:36.082]  In your face saying they're going to be authoritarian.
[01:38:36.082 --> 01:38:37.482]  That they are authoritarian.
[01:38:37.482 --> 01:38:42.184]  That yeah, they built it in stealth because they know best and you're a fool.
[01:38:42.184 --> 01:38:47.206]  And when you catch them in fraud, they have a one-day inquiry and say there was no fraud when it's admitted there was fraud.
[01:38:50.558 --> 01:38:55.723]  They are a conscious group of elitists that hate their fellow man, but I love my fellow man.
[01:38:55.723 --> 01:39:00.247]  When I see people dumbed down and stupid and petty, I feel sorry for them.
[01:39:00.247 --> 01:39:01.708]  I want to uplift them.
[01:39:01.708 --> 01:39:09.595]  The elites do everything they can to dumb people down and to fill our minds with mindless, pointless fluff, and then they sit there
[01:39:10.316 --> 01:39:12.597]  It's like breaking a cow's legs.
[01:39:12.597 --> 01:39:23.619]  Walking with a baseball bat, breaking its legs and watching it flopping around on the ground while wolves tear its guts out and saying, look at that stupid cow, it can't get up on its feet and defend itself.
[01:39:23.619 --> 01:39:30.000]  You break our legs so you can bring in your control grid so nobody can challenge you.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.401]  You reduce the average IQ by 20 points.
[01:39:32.401 --> 01:39:36.402]  That's what just drinking one part per million fluoride does in every major study.
[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:41.222]  With just five years of drinking it during development.
[01:39:41.222 --> 01:39:42.623]  It's not as bad if you drink it later.
[01:39:42.623 --> 01:39:46.545]  It's still poisonous to your whole system, but you develop the neural pathways.
[01:39:46.545 --> 01:39:48.386]  So it doesn't matter if you have massive brain die-off.
[01:39:48.386 --> 01:39:49.226]  You could still operate.
[01:39:49.226 --> 01:39:50.387]  That's the beauty of the human mind.
[01:39:50.387 --> 01:39:53.689]  That's why they say you only use 10% of your brain.
[01:39:53.689 --> 01:39:56.330]  Well, that's because most of your brain dies by the time you get old.
[01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:58.511]  So you need what you've got.
[01:39:58.511 --> 01:40:01.473]  It's like a gas tank.
[01:40:01.473 --> 01:40:04.534]  As the brain cells die, you make new neural connections.
[01:40:04.534 --> 01:40:05.755]  You use old pathways.
[01:40:08.524 --> 01:40:12.267]  You break our legs and you sit there watching humanity and squalor and pain.
[01:40:12.267 --> 01:40:27.600]  I read the Royal Commission report from 49 how they plan to destroy the third world, not let them industrialize, how the population would then explode, how that would be used as a people bomb to control them and keep them down and then later you would just exterminate that mass.
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:36.908]  Talk about evil and you sit up there telling us all day how much you love us and how good you are and how we're just a cancer, how we're a virus and you're going to eradicate us for our own good.
[01:40:45.154 --> 01:40:50.518]  Your water is being poisoned with hundreds of deadly chemicals by design.
[01:40:50.518 --> 01:40:54.581]  Your sperm count is down by over 85% in every country that fluoridates.
[01:40:54.581 --> 01:41:02.366]  You are being injected with time-delayed cancer viruses that embed in your cell structure DNA.
[01:41:02.366 --> 01:41:04.708]  The RNA embeds.
[01:41:04.708 --> 01:41:09.031]  The GMO food has been designed to sterilize you and to attack all your major organs.
[01:41:09.031 --> 01:41:11.032]  That's mainstream admitted.
[01:41:11.032 --> 01:41:12.113]  They just say it's an accident.
[01:41:17.079 --> 01:41:18.925]  You are being soft-killed.
[01:41:18.925 --> 01:41:21.153]  You are being intoxicated with poison.
[01:41:21.153 --> 01:41:23.300]  You are being murdered, slowly.
[01:41:24.517 --> 01:41:26.539]  That's what these psychopaths are doing.
[01:41:26.539 --> 01:41:28.360]  They are taking over the health care.
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:30.882]  They are taking over all facets of industry.
[01:41:30.882 --> 01:41:35.086]  They are brainwashing your children right now in public schools.
[01:41:35.086 --> 01:41:51.120]  And if you can't get your kids out of the public schools because they've gotten you financially to a point where you can't afford it, you can at least turn the television off and at least explain to your children how you're all under attack and your children's instincts will kick in and they will stop rebelling against you if you do it early enough.
[01:41:52.597 --> 01:41:57.581]  I will assure you, people's children in ancient times did not rebel against their parents like they do today.
[01:41:57.581 --> 01:41:59.322]  I've studied the history.
[01:41:59.322 --> 01:42:03.305]  Especially in oppressed groups, the children were absolutely on their family's team.
[01:42:03.305 --> 01:42:08.688]  But you weren't ever taught how to have your children on your side.
[01:42:08.688 --> 01:42:14.232]  In fact, you're taught through the psychological systems today how to turn your children against you.
[01:42:14.232 --> 01:42:16.354]  And you wonder why your children get worse and worse.
[01:42:16.354 --> 01:42:19.136]  They know in every study that when they started death education in 1991 in public schools,
[01:42:22.230 --> 01:42:26.992]  That within five to six years, suicide doubled, and now it's triple what it was in the 1980s.
[01:42:26.992 --> 01:42:34.196]  And they have all these specials about bullying and suicide, and all it does is increase the suicide, introducing the idea of suicide.
[01:42:34.196 --> 01:42:39.718]  They teach the kids how to commit suicide when they tell them don't commit suicide.
[01:42:39.718 --> 01:42:51.284]  It's just pure darkness by these mentally ill psychiatrists and psychologists who have the highest rate of suicide of any group.
[01:42:52.492 --> 01:42:55.692]  Oh, they're intelligent, but they're sick and twisted.
[01:42:57.110 --> 01:42:59.712]  They are insane but they're also conscious.
[01:42:59.712 --> 01:43:06.897]  These are horrible control freaks who know how humans work and are doing whatever they can to hurt you.
[01:43:06.897 --> 01:43:08.799]  They enjoy that power over you.
[01:43:08.799 --> 01:43:10.460]  It's the ultimate power trip.
[01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:16.184]  It's what authoritarian despots and their servant class always do in every case.
[01:43:16.184 --> 01:43:24.410]  I'm only telling you history and what's currently happening and I just read to you quote after quote and article after article where they're openly saying, okay,
[01:43:25.231 --> 01:43:27.813]  We can't pass this through our legislatures.
[01:43:27.813 --> 01:43:42.942]  We're going to authoritarian force this through through the executive branches and we're going to start bullying and burning more things down and attacking more people.
[01:43:42.942 --> 01:43:47.404]  They mean business.
[01:43:47.404 --> 01:43:49.446]  Because we are kicking their butt.
[01:43:50.421 --> 01:43:52.141]  Peacefully, with the information.
[01:43:52.141 --> 01:43:53.622]  The people are waking up.
[01:43:53.622 --> 01:43:58.343]  That's why they're trying to provocateur militias nationwide to start a war.
[01:43:58.343 --> 01:44:01.884]  That's why they're setting people up.
[01:44:01.884 --> 01:44:14.007]  Because they want an excuse to come in with violence against us, but they need to trigger violence first, so they have a pretext to come after the American people and the people of the world.
[01:44:14.007 --> 01:44:18.948]  And if you do catch one of these environmentalists trying to burn your house down, it's legal and lawful,
[01:44:19.935 --> 01:44:21.016]  In all but a few U.S.
[01:44:21.016 --> 01:44:24.457]  cities to defend yourself.
[01:44:24.457 --> 01:44:26.479]  It's time to arm yourself.
[01:44:26.479 --> 01:44:28.079]  Work for peace.
[01:44:28.079 --> 01:44:34.983]  Work for a peaceful restoration of the republic against these revolutionaries.
[01:44:34.983 --> 01:44:38.065]  They're funded by the same banks that funded the fascists and the communists.
[01:44:38.065 --> 01:44:43.508]  And as Carl Quigley wrote at Georgetown, he was allowed into the globalist annals of OSS and CIA.
[01:44:45.182 --> 01:44:53.485]  They control the authoritarian spectrum and they give you false choices within the authoritarian spectrum.
[01:44:53.485 --> 01:45:02.308]  We work for peace, we prepare for war.
[01:45:02.308 --> 01:45:05.569]  And we study the art of war for knowledge and defense.
[01:45:06.681 --> 01:45:09.003]  By the way, many philosophers said that.
[01:45:09.003 --> 01:45:11.725]  That isn't from Star Wars, though you've heard it there.
[01:45:11.725 --> 01:45:17.089]  The Jedi never uses the Force for attack, only for knowledge and defense.
[01:45:17.089 --> 01:45:20.812]  That goes back to the philosophers.
[01:45:20.812 --> 01:45:26.496]  Leaked UN documents reveal plan for Green World Order by 2012.
[01:45:28.829 --> 01:45:49.300]  Leaked policy documents reveal the United Nations plans to create a Green World Order by 2012, which will be enforced by a structure of global governance and funded by a gargantuan $45 trillion transfer of wealth from the richest countries as the globalist insidious plan to centralize power, crush sovereignty, while devastating the economy is exposed once again.
[01:45:50.635 --> 01:46:05.863]  As we warned at the time, this failure of Copenhagen in December did not spell the end of the global warming heist, but merely a roadblock in the UN's agenda to create a world government funded by taxes paid by you on the very substance you exhale, carbon dioxide.
[01:46:06.656 --> 01:46:21.483]  By using the justification of the vehemently debunked hoax that carbon dioxide is a deadly threat to our planet, the UN is already working to resurrect the failed Copenhagen argument with a series of new Copenhagen process negotiations set to take place in April, May and June.
[01:46:21.483 --> 01:46:30.268]  Leaked planning documents obtained by Fox News lift the lid off the UN's plan to impose global governance by the end of 2012, World Summit of Sustainable Development in Rio.
[01:46:31.107 --> 01:46:32.048]  That's a quote from the document.
[01:46:32.048 --> 01:46:32.128]  Now...
[01:46:55.569 --> 01:47:04.853]  As we told you back in December when Copenhagen failed, that they announced that the G20 banks that run this would just start levying taxes through the executive and paying it to themselves.
[01:47:04.853 --> 01:47:09.755]  And that's now been announced two weeks ago by Gordon Brown.
[01:47:09.755 --> 01:47:14.477]  That's actually in Invisible Empire, by the way.
[01:47:14.477 --> 01:47:15.957]  That's how up-to-date this film is.
[01:47:15.957 --> 01:47:17.118]  We were working on it two weeks ago.
[01:47:22.933 --> 01:47:34.042]  And it goes on to talk about a radical transformation, an authoritarian system.
[01:47:34.042 --> 01:47:41.668]  So remember what they're doing with your school children, with your Brownies and Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts, what they're doing at your churches.
[01:47:42.659 --> 01:47:49.744]  Well-meaning preachers, well-meaning scout leaders, well-meaning public school teachers up there telling your children the earth is dying.
[01:47:49.744 --> 01:47:51.145]  We've got to have global government.
[01:47:51.145 --> 01:47:52.106]  That's in the textbooks.
[01:47:52.106 --> 01:47:54.288]  We've got to have a new world order.
[01:47:54.288 --> 01:47:56.730]  We've got to restrict what we're doing.
[01:47:56.730 --> 01:47:58.171]  Your parents are bad.
[01:47:58.171 --> 01:48:00.713]  I've seen that in Time Magazine, Newsweek for Kids.
[01:48:00.713 --> 01:48:02.894]  I've seen it in the New York Times.
[01:48:02.894 --> 01:48:04.676]  Al Gore, what, last year gave a speech?
[01:48:05.376 --> 01:48:09.959]  He gives them all over the country to elementary students saying, your parents are bad.
[01:48:09.959 --> 01:48:11.581]  You've got to report them.
[01:48:11.581 --> 01:48:13.142]  You've got to tell them they're wrong.
[01:48:13.142 --> 01:48:20.327]  I mean, you let the state come in and you let criminal thugs come in and tell your children to turn against you?
[01:48:20.327 --> 01:48:24.150]  The most fundamental, outrageous, authoritarian tyranny?
[01:48:25.362 --> 01:48:46.590]  And they're all over the news announcing they're going to get more aggressive with people, and they're... I've got news articles all over the US, Canada, England, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, of the Green Police, just like in the Audi ad, but real police in white and green uniforms and white and green trucks, creating SWAT teams and harassing people, and saying they're going to arrest you for the wrong light bulbs or the wrong toilet.
[01:48:47.310 --> 01:49:02.222]  And they've got all these horribly dumbed down violent kids that have played video games, filled with violence, who just want power, that are now 20, 25 years old, getting uniforms and getting weapon systems, who've been taught to get violent with us?
[01:49:02.222 --> 01:49:07.206]  And then, God forbid, when they're beating you up or robbing your house that you defend yourself, you're going to be called a terrorist!
[01:49:08.447 --> 01:49:11.309]  And they want you to defend yourself, but what else can you do?
[01:49:11.309 --> 01:49:12.930]  They want a war with you.
[01:49:12.930 --> 01:49:17.052]  They want blood, like every other tyrant and their servants have always wanted.
[01:49:17.052 --> 01:49:18.673]  They recruit scum.
[01:49:18.673 --> 01:49:20.354]  They recruit control freaks.
[01:49:20.354 --> 01:49:22.615]  They recruit criminal filth.
[01:49:22.615 --> 01:49:27.418]  And the government is run universally by criminal filth at the top.
[01:49:27.418 --> 01:49:37.504]  And it's time for the military, it's time for the police to read what these enemies actually say, and to realize they're not a bunch of tree-petting, tree-hugging, dolphin-hugging, well-meaning idiots.
[01:49:37.844 --> 01:49:45.847]  These are a murder gang of pirates and thugs openly poisoning your water supply.
[01:49:45.847 --> 01:49:47.948]  That's why your testosterone level's down.
[01:49:47.948 --> 01:49:49.389]  That's why your sperm count's down.
[01:49:49.389 --> 01:49:50.909]  That's why women can't have children.
[01:49:50.909 --> 01:49:55.431]  That's why your thyroid's screwed up over 30% of women now and your hair's falling out.
[01:49:55.431 --> 01:49:59.112]  You're being chemically savaged every single day.
[01:49:59.112 --> 01:50:01.213]  You think you're part of the government, fools?
[01:50:01.213 --> 01:50:03.914]  And I'm talking to even the environmental servants.
[01:50:03.914 --> 01:50:05.555]  You don't know what you're part of.
[01:50:06.516 --> 01:50:08.456]  But I'm here telling you what you're part of.
[01:50:08.456 --> 01:50:15.678]  I'm here reading what your capos and what your bosses are saying and what they're setting up and what they're doing.
[01:50:15.678 --> 01:50:18.599]  So I tell you now, you don't have to choose a side.
[01:50:18.599 --> 01:50:21.459]  You are on the side of humanity, fools.
[01:50:21.459 --> 01:50:32.042]  Those of you that serve this, you may play a mental mind trick with yourself and tell yourself you're part of the winning team and you get off on that primitive feeling of power over society.
[01:50:32.998 --> 01:50:42.980]  But I tell you from the bottom of my heart and from the depths of my intellect and all the research we've done, humanity now faces the greatest evil in its history.
[01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:58.503]  And it is up to all of us who see this corruption and see this threat to our species to become fully informed and to focus mentally and prepare ourselves and to go out to every hill and mountain, every valley, and to warn the people
[01:51:01.141 --> 01:51:02.443]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.443 --> 01:51:08.029]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.029 --> 01:51:13.056]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.056 --> 01:51:18.082]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.622 --> 01:51:23.846]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.846 --> 01:51:30.970]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.970 --> 01:51:32.071]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.071 --> 01:51:38.435]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.755 --> 01:51:41.936]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.936 --> 01:51:44.157]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:44.157 --> 01:51:44.957]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:44.957 --> 01:51:45.257]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.257 --> 01:51:48.738]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.738 --> 01:51:50.478]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:01.431 --> 01:52:02.371]  You worry.
[01:52:02.371 --> 01:52:04.392]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:52:04.392 --> 01:52:06.933]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:52:06.933 --> 01:52:09.014]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:52:09.014 --> 01:52:10.635]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:52:10.635 --> 01:52:14.216]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:52:14.216 --> 01:52:19.458]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:52:19.458 --> 01:52:22.760]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:24.941]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:52:24.941 --> 01:52:27.803]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:52:27.803 --> 01:52:31.125]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:52:31.125 --> 01:52:39.551]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:52:39.551 --> 01:52:44.254]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[01:52:44.254 --> 01:52:48.277]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.

[01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:53.963]  Eat Free.
[01:52:53.963 --> 01:52:56.090]  That number again.
[01:52:56.090 --> 01:52:56.853]  888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:52:56.853 --> 01:52:59.381]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[01:53:00.999 --> 01:53:04.201]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you've got to try MyPillow.
[01:53:04.201 --> 01:53:07.944]  Introducing the most revolutionary, most comfortable, and coolest pillow ever.

[01:53:52.489 --> 01:53:52.929]  MyPillow.
[01:53:52.929 --> 01:53:53.850]  For the rest of your life.
[01:54:08.483 --> 01:54:18.026]  We're going to Ernie, Steve, Herman, Brian, Joe and others.
[01:54:18.026 --> 01:54:18.886]  Covering a lot of news.
[01:54:18.886 --> 01:54:19.746]  Wide open telephones.
[01:54:19.746 --> 01:54:20.827]  We start the next hour.
[01:54:20.827 --> 01:54:22.307]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:22.307 --> 01:54:27.969]  When I say you have to choose sides, you have to do that consciously.
[01:54:27.969 --> 01:54:30.210]  You are on the side of humanity.
[01:54:30.210 --> 01:54:32.491]  No matter what position of power you have.
[01:54:32.491 --> 01:54:35.832]  These elitists have only lied to themselves and don't know that they're connected to everyone else.
[01:54:38.274 --> 01:54:48.259]  And to all the servants who are on these power trips, these petty power trips, you are under attack just as much as I'm under attack, or my staff is under attack.
[01:54:48.259 --> 01:54:49.899]  And this attack is out in the open.
[01:54:49.899 --> 01:54:51.820]  There's no more time for denial.
[01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:53.941]  There's no more time to play games.
[01:54:53.941 --> 01:54:58.363]  You need to research the information we cover in Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:54:58.363 --> 01:55:06.427]  You need to research all the documents and articles we post on a daily basis as our enemies say they want to oppress us and hurt us and, yes, kill us.
[01:55:08.288 --> 01:55:09.689]  That's what other dictators did.
[01:55:09.689 --> 01:55:10.990]  That's what other corrupt systems did.
[01:55:10.990 --> 01:55:12.651]  That's their nature.
[01:55:12.651 --> 01:55:17.535]  That's the type of people that get into power when governments and societies go bad.
[01:55:17.535 --> 01:55:31.785]  The mindset of the psychopath, of the sadist, of the control freak, of the power-tripping evil types that are out there is then manifest throughout the country, throughout the empire, throughout the world when these people get into control.
[01:55:33.217 --> 01:55:37.779]  It's like if you own your house, you decide what color to have the roof, what color to paint it.
[01:55:37.779 --> 01:55:39.179]  You decide what fixtures you have.
[01:55:39.179 --> 01:55:41.000]  You decide what color carpet.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.041]  You decide what books are on the shelves.
[01:55:43.041 --> 01:55:45.762]  Well, look at the books on our shelves as a society.
[01:55:45.762 --> 01:55:46.642]  Look at the television.
[01:55:46.642 --> 01:55:47.663]  Look at the culture.
[01:55:47.663 --> 01:55:49.063]  Look at what the elite is pushing.
[01:55:49.063 --> 01:55:50.304]  Look at what they're into.
[01:55:50.304 --> 01:55:53.765]  Look at what they say they are erecting.
[01:55:53.765 --> 01:55:55.746]  Look at what they've built.
[01:55:55.746 --> 01:55:57.527]  Look at their fruits.
[01:55:57.527 --> 01:56:00.608]  And there's no time for denial anymore.
[01:56:02.881 --> 01:56:06.043]  We have to make a decision as a society, as a species.
[01:56:06.043 --> 01:56:09.586]  We have to decide what our priorities are.
[01:56:09.586 --> 01:56:12.889]  Is your priority just enjoying yourself?
[01:56:12.889 --> 01:56:16.631]  Is your priority just having fun?
[01:56:16.631 --> 01:56:24.838]  You've been beguiled into this system to blind yourself so you don't see what's happening so they can control the world, so they can control human destiny.
[01:56:25.592 --> 01:56:31.317]  The most horrific individuals the world has ever seen in control of our destiny.
[01:56:31.317 --> 01:56:32.418]  That's what this is about.
[01:56:32.418 --> 01:56:35.160]  We all die, but our species goes on.
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:36.161]  We would have no freedom.
[01:56:36.161 --> 01:56:37.162]  We would have no free market.
[01:56:37.162 --> 01:56:41.606]  We would have no private property if we didn't have people that stood up for it earlier.
[01:56:41.606 --> 01:56:52.555]  We owe everything to our ancestors, and our ancestors are gonna not just roll in their graves, but our progeny will look back on us, their ancestors, with shame.
[01:56:53.973 --> 01:56:58.154]  History is watching right now.
[01:56:58.154 --> 01:57:02.155]  So make a decision to get really focused on these issues and to get really informed.
[01:57:02.155 --> 01:57:03.515]  Do not believe me.
[01:57:03.515 --> 01:57:08.357]  To research it for yourself and find out just how serious this is and to support us.
[01:57:08.357 --> 01:57:11.337]  We need treasure to fund this operation.
[01:57:11.337 --> 01:57:12.818]  We need funds.
[01:57:12.818 --> 01:57:16.899]  We need you to buy the books and videos that wake other people up.
[01:57:16.899 --> 01:57:20.120]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:20.960]  But if you can't buy,
[01:57:22.466 --> 01:57:24.007]  Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[01:57:24.007 --> 01:57:36.331]  If you can't purchase the two new films coming out this month, Invisible Empire and New Order Defined, that are incredible documentaries that will wake people up, you can give people the free link who have iPhones to the iPhone app.
[01:57:36.331 --> 01:57:38.251]  You can send people the YouTube videos.
[01:57:38.251 --> 01:57:44.433]  You can share your passcode with a few friends and family from PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:57:44.433 --> 01:57:47.955]  If you have the time and the capital and the energy, make copies of the films.
[01:57:47.955 --> 01:57:48.635]  Give them to people.
[01:57:49.505 --> 01:57:59.687]  The population knows something is wrong intellectually, but more importantly, those that have any soul feel it in their gut, their discernment.
[01:57:59.687 --> 01:58:07.608]  So we're going to come back and take your calls, but we have two new trailers out for both the two new films at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com or on the YouTube channel.
[01:58:07.608 --> 01:58:10.309]  Please send it out to everyone you know.
[01:58:10.309 --> 01:58:17.310]  And please order the DVDs and make copies of them and give them out to everyone you know.
[01:58:17.310 --> 01:58:18.150]  Please order.
[01:58:21.101 --> 01:58:22.421]  Endgame.
[01:58:22.421 --> 01:58:26.883]  You may have researched my claims and know they're true, but your friends and family, they haven't.
[01:58:26.883 --> 01:58:28.884]  Endgame has an online bibliography.
[01:58:28.884 --> 01:58:30.664]  Whatistheendgame.com.
[01:58:30.664 --> 01:58:33.165]  Just don't wait any longer.
[01:58:33.165 --> 01:58:35.766]  However you can, warn the people.
[01:58:35.766 --> 01:58:38.367]  The documentary films are one of the best ways to do it.
[01:58:38.367 --> 01:58:43.368]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:43.368 --> 01:58:45.869]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.869 --> 01:58:48.230]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:54.918 --> 01:58:56.179]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:56.179 --> 01:59:00.122]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:59:00.122 --> 01:59:02.524]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:02.524 --> 01:59:08.228]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:59:08.228 --> 01:59:14.893]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:14.893 --> 01:59:20.878]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:59:20.878 --> 01:59:24.621]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:59:25.041 --> 01:59:29.324]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:59:29.324 --> 01:59:35.289]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:59:35.289 --> 01:59:38.832]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:59:38.832 --> 01:59:40.813]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:59:40.813 --> 01:59:41.934]  It's here.

[01:59:53.931 --> 01:59:56.333]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.333 --> 02:00:05.458]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.458 --> 02:00:06.759]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.759 --> 02:00:08.540]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.540 --> 02:00:10.301]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.301 --> 02:00:11.862]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.862 --> 02:00:13.443]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.443 --> 02:00:17.625]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.625 --> 02:00:21.688]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.630 --> 02:00:32.165]  We have reached the halfway point in this Monday edition, the 5th day of April 2010.
[02:00:32.165 --> 02:00:36.092]  I've looked at all the different factors that are converging.
[02:00:37.403 --> 02:00:47.346]  And I've been saying for over three months that I believe the government is going to start staging terror attacks and fake raids on militias and tea parties and others as a demonization tactic.
[02:00:47.346 --> 02:00:48.646]  That's coming up later in the hour.
[02:00:48.646 --> 02:00:50.267]  Also, we're going to get into the economy.
[02:00:50.267 --> 02:00:53.148]  Also, Illinois Congressman, I don't worry about the Constitution.
[02:00:53.148 --> 02:00:55.128]  We're going to play that video.
[02:00:55.128 --> 02:00:56.169]  We are simulcasting.
[02:00:56.889 --> 02:00:58.330]  At PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:58.330 --> 02:01:04.232]  I want to get into the attacks on free speech that are going on and are being called for as well.
[02:01:04.232 --> 02:01:07.273]  But right now, let's start going to your phone calls.
[02:01:07.273 --> 02:01:09.054]  Let's talk to Ernie in California.
[02:01:09.054 --> 02:01:09.974]  Thanks for holding, Ernie.
[02:01:09.974 --> 02:01:10.554]  You're on the air.
[02:01:10.554 --> 02:01:11.655]  Hey, Alex.
[02:01:11.655 --> 02:01:11.995]  Okay.
[02:01:11.995 --> 02:01:13.075]  I got just three things.
[02:01:13.075 --> 02:01:26.200]  First of all, I'd like the people to get in touch and understand how evil these bankers are to read the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference so that they know that all these bankers were pulling everybody's money together before the war was even over.
[02:01:26.886 --> 02:01:27.626]  Couple other things.
[02:01:27.626 --> 02:01:30.787]  First of all, the stupid congressman that says the island's gonna tip over.
[02:01:30.787 --> 02:01:31.908]  Hilarious.
[02:01:31.908 --> 02:01:39.830]  The other thing, Clinton admitting that his free trade agreement wiped out the rice growing for Haiti and basically made them starving.
[02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:45.252]  And the last thing I'd like to ask, what about the state bank of North Dakota?
[02:01:45.252 --> 02:01:48.873]  And how that runs totally separate and having no problems.
[02:01:48.873 --> 02:01:52.194]  Why can't every other state do what the state of North Dakota did in 1919?
[02:01:53.544 --> 02:02:07.390]  Absolutely, that's a big part of the solution, is getting the power of credit in the government hands, instead of the government violating the Constitution and giving up that power and giving it to a private banking cartel, under the 1913 Federal Reserve Act.
[02:02:07.390 --> 02:02:15.053]  Yeah, and one other thing, just for the guy, the guy with the little stone, the first caller, they did find a giant pyramid off the Bimini Coast in Atlantic.
[02:02:15.792 --> 02:02:24.280]  I appreciate the call, Ernie.
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:31.587]  Yeah, you know, we don't screen calls on your topics, but we are going to start not having callers on, John, who sound like they're stoned.
[02:02:31.587 --> 02:02:33.689]  If somebody has trouble talking, they're not on.
[02:02:36.983 --> 02:02:39.044]  You know, Ronald Reagan made me set up in case you didn't know this.
[02:02:39.044 --> 02:02:40.164]  When he brought in two things back in 1980,
[02:02:54.759 --> 02:03:02.561]  One was deregulation, the other one was tax incentives to move big business offshore, and they're still doing that today.
[02:03:02.561 --> 02:03:08.802]  But it wasn't real deregulation, they just gave the banks and megacorporations more power to get more government contracts.
[02:03:08.802 --> 02:03:15.104]  It's not deregulation, it's not privatization to have corporations become government.
[02:03:15.104 --> 02:03:15.904]  Yeah.
[02:03:15.904 --> 02:03:18.425]  I wish we had Rob Paul on too.
[02:03:18.425 --> 02:03:22.286]  He would bring up something about throwing people in jail.
[02:03:22.286 --> 02:03:24.166]  I never hear of anybody doing that.
[02:03:25.050 --> 02:03:28.033]  Oh, I'm not trying to come late with all this stuff.
[02:03:28.033 --> 02:03:34.278]  I wish when Jesse Ventura comes on tomorrow, he wouldn't drop the ball on this one, maybe.
[02:03:34.278 --> 02:03:37.100]  Don't worry about 9-11 as much as 9-10.
[02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:40.523]  When billions was traded in airline stocks,
[02:03:40.939 --> 02:03:46.644]  They were going to follow it, it was all computerized, but it died on the vine somehow.
[02:03:46.644 --> 02:04:01.836]  And they said this would be a piece of cake following who brought these towers down and that because... That's right, that was in AP and Reuters and then it all got shut down when it turned out the Executive Director of the CIA was running the record put options on American and United, Buzzy Krongard.
[02:04:01.836 --> 02:04:02.536]  Really good points.
[02:04:03.877 --> 02:04:05.619]  I haven't dropped the ball on that.
[02:04:05.619 --> 02:04:18.272]  I've probably done, I don't know, more than ten interviews with Ron Paul out of the close to a hundred, where we bring up state grand juries indicting politicians for things that are openly criminal.
[02:04:18.272 --> 02:04:24.598]  And I call every day for moving towards criminal charges against the private banking shadow government.
[02:04:25.479 --> 02:04:33.667]  So you must have missed those shows, and Ron Paul was on in the first 25 minutes, in the first half hour of the radio show.
[02:04:33.667 --> 02:04:37.811]  Ron Paul was on with us, so that'll be in the podcast and re-aired on stations.
[02:04:37.811 --> 02:04:41.694]  And when the show restarts, coming up in about an hour and 55 minutes, that will re-air.
[02:04:41.694 --> 02:04:44.637]  It'll be the first thing that you'll hear is that Ron Paul interview.
[02:04:45.698 --> 02:04:46.179]  We're good to go.
[02:05:01.237 --> 02:05:07.860]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:12.983]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:12.983 --> 02:05:21.728]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:21.728 --> 02:05:25.790]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:27.751]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:05:30.077 --> 02:05:34.818]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:05:34.818 --> 02:05:38.639]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[02:05:38.639 --> 02:05:39.879]  Other's don't.
[02:05:39.879 --> 02:05:42.020]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:43.800]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:46.701]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:46.701 --> 02:05:53.322]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:05:53.322 --> 02:05:56.023]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:05:56.023 --> 02:05:58.384]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[02:05:58.384 --> 02:05:58.884]  Others don't.
[02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:04.381]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.381 --> 02:06:09.704]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.704 --> 02:06:11.744]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.744 --> 02:06:16.747]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.747 --> 02:06:17.927]  How much do you want?
[02:06:17.927 --> 02:06:19.068]  When do you want it?
[02:06:19.068 --> 02:06:20.948]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:20.948 --> 02:06:22.009]  When will you need it?
[02:06:22.009 --> 02:06:24.210]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:24.210 --> 02:06:25.550]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.550 --> 02:06:26.871]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:27.071 --> 02:06:32.336]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:32.336 --> 02:06:35.939]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.939 --> 02:06:39.762]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.762 --> 02:06:40.984]  How much will you need?
[02:06:40.984 --> 02:06:41.884]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.884 --> 02:06:42.985]  How much do you want?
[02:06:42.985 --> 02:06:43.926]  All you can get.
[02:06:43.926 --> 02:06:44.727]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:45.007 --> 02:06:48.048]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:48.048 --> 02:06:51.190]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:51.190 --> 02:06:51.690]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.782 --> 02:07:01.942]  What's your home worth?
[02:07:01.942 --> 02:07:04.063]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:07:04.063 --> 02:07:07.084]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[02:07:07.084 --> 02:07:14.806]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[02:08:01.623 --> 02:08:10.851]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.851 --> 02:08:12.393]  Katherine Austin Fitch.
[02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:14.160]  We're good to go.
[02:08:34.656 --> 02:08:36.557]  So that's coming up in the next hour.
[02:08:36.557 --> 02:08:37.637]  I want to go over the economy.
[02:08:37.637 --> 02:08:40.038]  I want to get into attacks on free speech.
[02:08:40.038 --> 02:08:45.919]  You know, Obama giving all these different interviews saying that it's troublesome what's happening in talk radio.
[02:08:45.919 --> 02:08:50.761]  While all of his surrogates are calling for censorship, he says, well, maybe we'll stop short of that.
[02:08:52.561 --> 02:09:10.673]  And what he's doing is behaving like his surrogates aren't out calling for violence, attacking people, calling everyone racist that criticized the government, the Black Congressional Caucus, lying and saying they were spit at and called the N-word, now on video, the exact incident, complete lie.
[02:09:10.673 --> 02:09:12.795]  So he plays the part of the high and mighty.
[02:09:12.795 --> 02:09:18.078]  He's not getting involved in all the infighting while his surrogates are out there stirring it all up.
[02:09:18.078 --> 02:09:22.021]  That's coming up after I talk to Herman, Brian, Joe, Jeff, Jake, and others.
[02:09:22.541 --> 02:09:24.922]  I want to tell you about a few of the great sponsors, though.
[02:09:24.922 --> 02:09:27.363]  It's not enough to just own firearms.
[02:09:27.363 --> 02:09:30.564]  You need to get firearms training.
[02:09:30.564 --> 02:09:38.748]  And the biggest and best private firearms training in the U.S., with no drill instructor or tough guy attitude, is FrontSight.com.
[02:09:38.748 --> 02:09:40.128]  Look at the front of your rifle.
[02:09:40.128 --> 02:09:42.069]  FrontSight.com.
[02:09:42.069 --> 02:09:42.449]  One word.
[02:09:42.449 --> 02:09:43.930]  FrontSight.com.
[02:09:43.930 --> 02:09:48.472]  They've got a deal where you can get five days of firearms training, attend five world-class
[02:09:49.940 --> 02:09:50.240]  And lastly,
[02:10:09.895 --> 02:10:11.896]  Diamond Gusset jeans.
[02:10:11.896 --> 02:10:19.341]  I'm phasing out my Levi's and going exclusively to Diamond Gusset because all the new Levi's just tear out in the crotch or tear out in the back.
[02:10:19.341 --> 02:10:20.322]  They're made in Mexico.
[02:10:20.322 --> 02:10:21.483]  They're total crud now.
[02:10:21.483 --> 02:10:23.164]  Levi's are a joke.
[02:10:23.164 --> 02:10:23.824]  It is official.
[02:10:23.824 --> 02:10:25.345]  I've worn them my whole life.
[02:10:25.345 --> 02:10:30.108]  Diamond Gusset fit great and they've got a reinforced crotch in other areas.
[02:10:30.108 --> 02:10:32.130]  They've also got motorcycle jeans.
[02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:33.811]  Yes, hello Alex, can you hear me?
[02:10:58.451 --> 02:11:00.533]  Yes, I have three quick questions.
[02:11:00.533 --> 02:11:12.243]  My first question would be, how is it that somebody like me who lives in a big city like New York, how can I go about getting firearms to defend myself when things start to collapse?
[02:11:12.243 --> 02:11:16.667]  Well, you live in one of three cities where the Second Amendment is basically banned.
[02:11:17.714 --> 02:11:22.982]  They've lost at the federal court, at the Supreme Court in D.C.
[02:11:22.982 --> 02:11:30.694]  saying that you can't not allow people to be armed, and then they get raped, robbed, and killed, but the cities don't care.
[02:11:30.694 --> 02:11:31.355]  They're still just...
[02:11:32.233 --> 02:11:33.813]  Carrying that through.
[02:11:33.813 --> 02:11:41.916]  If you get a background check and give tens of thousands of dollars to politicians in campaign contributions, they'll make a phone call and you can get a concealed carry.
[02:11:41.916 --> 02:11:44.577]  All the Goldman Sachs execs have them.
[02:11:44.577 --> 02:11:47.158]  The off-duty cops get to have them.
[02:11:47.158 --> 02:11:49.038]  Bureaucrats and politicians get to have them.
[02:11:49.038 --> 02:11:51.779]  And taxpayers are paid for bodyguards in many cases.
[02:11:51.779 --> 02:11:53.980]  There was a Bloomberg article a few months ago.
[02:11:53.980 --> 02:11:56.480]  In fact, pull that up on screen for folks.
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:00.862]  I believe the headline was, Goldman Sachs arming themselves against public
[02:12:01.957 --> 02:12:08.881]  And so, sorry, you live in the model of what they want to make America.
[02:12:08.881 --> 02:12:11.763]  A haven for criminals in and out of government.
[02:12:11.763 --> 02:12:13.764]  Criminals at every level.
[02:12:13.764 --> 02:12:15.945]  Just like many U.S.
[02:12:15.945 --> 02:12:18.967]  states now, you can't have burglar bars to even protect yourself.
[02:12:18.967 --> 02:12:24.050]  It's about making you easy for the criminal class to have their way with you.
[02:12:24.050 --> 02:12:24.670]  Okay.
[02:12:24.670 --> 02:12:28.272]  And my second question is the nanny state.
[02:12:28.272 --> 02:12:29.633]  From what I've studied in history,
[02:12:30.426 --> 02:12:37.429]  I believe it began with FDR and his New Deal, but I hear a lot of patriots saying how great FDR was.
[02:12:37.429 --> 02:12:40.050]  Can you speak to that real quickly?
[02:12:40.050 --> 02:12:47.792]  Well, I mean, I like Webster Tarpley, and I appreciate your call, Herman, but I disagree with him about FDR being good.
[02:12:47.792 --> 02:12:52.194]  It's true that right-wing, Hitler-backed forces, Prescott Bush,
[02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:56.851]  George Herbert Walker Bush's father, George W. Bush's grandfather.
[02:12:56.851 --> 02:12:58.291]  It did come out in congressional hearings.
[02:12:58.291 --> 02:12:59.131]  It was confirmed.
[02:12:59.131 --> 02:13:04.332]  They tried to hire the head of the Marine Corps to stage a military overthrow of the U.S.
[02:13:04.332 --> 02:13:06.412]  to then link up with Hitler.
[02:13:06.412 --> 02:13:13.073]  And so people like Tarpley then like FDR because he didn't go along with that.
[02:13:13.073 --> 02:13:17.574]  But FDR did start the process of domesticating and getting people dependent.
[02:13:17.574 --> 02:13:21.935]  But the nanny state is like domesticating pigs.
[02:13:22.998 --> 02:13:28.404]  And I've told this many times, but going back thousands of years ago, you can domesticate wild hogs a day like this.
[02:13:28.404 --> 02:13:30.426]  You put up a fence area.
[02:13:30.426 --> 02:13:32.829]  You put some grain in it or corn every day.
[02:13:32.829 --> 02:13:37.754]  For a few months, the pigs get accustomed to being in the enclosure.
[02:13:37.754 --> 02:13:41.859]  And then generally, with bows and arrows or throwing spears or pits,
[02:13:43.018 --> 02:13:58.082]  You would kill the adults once you got them inside the enclosure, once they were trained to all go inside in a pack or a herd, and then you would keep the baby piglets and then raise them in smaller pens and pet them and feed them and be nice to them so that they thought of you as part of their group.
[02:13:58.082 --> 02:14:02.923]  But then a few times a year you take them down the road so you don't upset the other pigs and you slit their throat.
[02:14:04.062 --> 02:14:05.703]  And so that's what the new deal is.
[02:14:05.703 --> 02:14:08.145]  We're just a bunch of domesticated animals now.
[02:14:08.145 --> 02:14:10.807]  And now they're saying you're not going to get your health care.
[02:14:10.807 --> 02:14:12.148]  Oh, you blew your knee out?
[02:14:12.148 --> 02:14:13.810]  We'll give you some steroids for it.
[02:14:13.810 --> 02:14:14.810]  Not a surgery.
[02:14:14.810 --> 02:14:15.731]  Oh, you need eye surgery?
[02:14:15.731 --> 02:14:16.392]  You're above 60?
[02:14:16.392 --> 02:14:17.072]  You're not getting it.
[02:14:17.072 --> 02:14:20.315]  Oh, you got to wait a year and a half for a brain surgery.
[02:14:20.315 --> 02:14:24.158]  And of course the insurance companies are eugenicists and they get all the profit and tax money.
[02:14:24.158 --> 02:14:27.781]  Then they give you horrible care as Dr. Ron Paul agreed earlier.
[02:14:27.781 --> 02:14:33.025]  And so the right wing will never talk about the fact that it's really an insurance banking scam because
[02:14:34.363 --> 02:14:36.364]  They're bought and paid for by those interests.
[02:14:36.364 --> 02:14:39.547]  The insurance companies play along with the ruse like they're against it.
[02:14:39.547 --> 02:14:41.688]  The left then thinks they're getting something free.
[02:14:41.688 --> 02:14:48.133]  When it doesn't get delivered in a few years, they'll then push total government health care, as Ron Paul said in the first hour.
[02:14:48.133 --> 02:14:51.275]  We're on the same page because we should be the same enemy.
[02:14:51.275 --> 02:15:00.282]  So, people who are on the government dole think the government's their friend, like a pig, when they come over and throw some slop in.
[02:15:01.121 --> 02:15:08.147]  They look up lovingly at their master not knowing in a few months they're going to be hanging up by their legs with their throat being slit to bleed them out.
[02:15:08.147 --> 02:15:09.628]  They don't care.
[02:15:09.628 --> 02:15:12.991]  They don't know their master gives them water that sedates them and hurts them.
[02:15:12.991 --> 02:15:17.035]  Because a pig has value in a domestication situation.
[02:15:17.035 --> 02:15:20.298]  To the elite, there's six and a half billion of us, there is no value.
[02:15:21.856 --> 02:15:25.458]  So we have a negative value to the controllers.
[02:15:25.458 --> 02:15:27.719]  Let's go ahead and make another call here.
[02:15:27.719 --> 02:15:31.121]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Michigan.
[02:15:31.121 --> 02:15:31.721]  You're on the air.
[02:15:31.721 --> 02:15:38.504]  Hi, I'd like to talk about the earthquakes and why I think they're being caused by HAARP.
[02:15:38.504 --> 02:15:43.547]  I was on the internet doing some research and I found a graph from a government study
[02:15:46.269 --> 02:15:55.437]  Entire 20th century, the average number of earthquakes between magnitudes of 6 and 8 were around 3, but in the last 5 years the number has gone up to 25 and 30.
[02:15:55.437 --> 02:16:03.965]  I also see that... Yes, they're having record numbers of 6 and above, all the way up to 8 pluses.
[02:16:03.965 --> 02:16:08.109]  But you have to understand, that's what the phoneme... and I'm not knocking you, but let's talk about statistics here.
[02:16:08.689 --> 02:16:10.450]  That's what the controllers do.
[02:16:10.450 --> 02:16:17.595]  They show you a 10-year period where it gets hotter and they say in the last 80 years or 90 years it's never been this hot.
[02:16:17.595 --> 02:16:29.284]  They don't tell you the ice core samples show just 9,000 years ago that during the beginning of the Bronze Age the temperature on average was almost 10 degrees higher than it is now.
[02:16:29.284 --> 02:16:37.310]  And so just because since they've been registering things with seismographs the last 60 years and it hasn't been as intensified or as
[02:16:38.260 --> 02:16:40.762]  It's just like they say there's more tornadoes now.
[02:16:40.762 --> 02:16:47.368]  Well, that's because they've got more of the Doppler radar and other systems that catch the smaller tornadoes.
[02:16:47.368 --> 02:17:02.482]  But if you look at more earthquakes, there have been earthquakes so bad that areas the size of Colorado blow completely wide open and magma shoots 5,000 feet in the air and the entire Earth gets partially dark for 20 years.
[02:17:02.482 --> 02:17:02.863]  I mean, they have...
[02:17:04.224 --> 02:17:11.099]  Where I sit in Austin was nothing but volcanoes in the past, and they're now all extinct or dormant.
[02:17:11.099 --> 02:17:11.419]  And so...
[02:17:13.188 --> 02:17:23.575]  If you look at a hundred year cycle, then it is true that the last 50 plus years, because you can't go back 100, that there are more intense earthquakes as of late.
[02:17:23.575 --> 02:17:31.380]  But I mean, if you go back to the history books, say 2000 years ago, Rome was constantly having volcanoes and giant earthquakes.
[02:17:31.380 --> 02:17:34.002]  And now they're not having as many.
[02:17:34.002 --> 02:17:38.405]  I mean, have you seen a volcano blow up and kill an entire city like Pompeii?
[02:17:38.405 --> 02:17:40.866]  No, you haven't seen that recently.
[02:17:40.866 --> 02:17:42.628]  So, I mean, we are continents.
[02:17:44.209 --> 02:17:49.392]  It's almost what Hank Johnson said, kind of an idiot savant.
[02:17:49.392 --> 02:17:57.997]  Islands aren't floating on the water, but islands are the tips of mountains and hill ranges that are floating on magma.
[02:17:57.997 --> 02:17:58.918]  Okay?
[02:17:58.918 --> 02:18:03.621]  So, but the government did say in 97 they have seismic earthquake weapons.
[02:18:03.621 --> 02:18:07.423]  We know they've been working on it, and so it could be that.
[02:18:07.423 --> 02:18:11.926]  It's just having a whole bunch of earthquakes all of a sudden doesn't mean that's man.
[02:18:11.926 --> 02:18:12.206]  Go ahead.
[02:18:13.433 --> 02:18:21.443]  Okay, this year I've seen that there's already been 72 earthquakes and last year there were only 29.
[02:18:21.443 --> 02:18:30.193]  There's been a recorded earthquake every day since the first day of spring with the exception of March 24th and I also think the timing of it
[02:18:31.361 --> 02:18:38.225]  Uh... being that this is on the heels after the Copenhagen Treaty and Danny Glover coming out saying that this is the cause of global warming.
[02:18:38.225 --> 02:18:44.188]  Well, I agree with you that it's suspicious that they continue to hit mega-population centers.
[02:18:44.188 --> 02:18:46.530]  The very city in Haiti that's the biggest.
[02:18:46.530 --> 02:18:47.830]  The biggest city in Chile.
[02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:50.972]  Uh... you know, hitting San Diego, L.A.
[02:18:50.972 --> 02:18:52.853]  Biggest cities on the West Coast.
[02:18:52.853 --> 02:18:53.954]  It is suspicious
[02:18:54.614 --> 02:18:54.734]  Yes.
[02:19:24.242 --> 02:19:25.863]  Um, well, that's all I got.
[02:19:25.863 --> 02:19:27.064]  Thank you for the rub.
[02:19:27.064 --> 02:19:32.088]  Well, thank you, sir, but do you understand my point about you can't compare a hundred years to another hundred years?
[02:19:32.088 --> 02:19:34.730]  Like when they say we need to stabilize our climate.
[02:19:34.730 --> 02:19:36.391]  The climate's never been stable.
[02:19:36.391 --> 02:19:44.917]  We're a giant planetoid that's got an atmosphere thinner than the skin of an apple hurtling through space at twenty-something thousand miles an hour around a gigantic sun.
[02:19:44.917 --> 02:19:46.939]  There's nothing stable about that.
[02:19:46.939 --> 02:19:48.460]  There's a giant asteroid belt.
[02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:49.741]  Comets come flying by us.
[02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:52.043]  There's nothing stable about it.
[02:19:52.043 --> 02:19:56.674]  The government says everything's got to be stable, the temperature's got to be 76 degrees year-round.
[02:19:56.674 --> 02:19:59.520]  Mommy, is it true we used to have seasons?
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:19:59.721]  Shh!
[02:19:59.721 --> 02:20:00.743]  They'll arrest you for saying that!
[02:20:01.465 --> 02:20:08.689]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[02:20:08.689 --> 02:20:12.631]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[02:20:12.631 --> 02:20:20.955]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[02:20:20.955 --> 02:20:23.857]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[02:20:23.857 --> 02:20:26.358]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[02:20:26.638 --> 02:20:27.219]  We're good to go.
[02:20:49.062 --> 02:20:51.523]  Visit IDStronghold.com.
[02:20:51.523 --> 02:20:54.025]  That's IDStronghold.com.

[02:21:03.530 --> 02:21:05.771]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:21:05.771 --> 02:21:09.113]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:21:09.113 --> 02:21:14.216]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:14.216 --> 02:21:18.398]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:18.718 --> 02:21:21.180]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:21.180 --> 02:21:23.601]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:23.601 --> 02:21:26.863]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:26.863 --> 02:21:34.468]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.808 --> 02:21:40.069]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:40.069 --> 02:21:42.510]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:42.510 --> 02:21:46.731]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:46.731 --> 02:21:47.811]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:47.811 --> 02:21:49.152]  You're everyone else.
[02:21:49.152 --> 02:21:50.632]  Invisible Empire.

[02:22:31.344 --> 02:22:35.887]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:35.887 --> 02:22:41.711]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.711 --> 02:22:45.353]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:23:06.629 --> 02:23:07.510]  Don't!
[02:23:07.510 --> 02:23:10.953]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[02:24:10.140 --> 02:24:14.182]  Okay, John, who's up next here?
[02:24:14.182 --> 02:24:15.042]  Joe in Wyoming.
[02:24:15.042 --> 02:24:15.663]  You're on the air.
[02:24:15.663 --> 02:24:16.343]  Thanks for holding.
[02:24:16.343 --> 02:24:18.144]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:18.144 --> 02:24:19.604]  I'm a first-time caller.
[02:24:19.604 --> 02:24:22.586]  I've been listening to you since December of 2009.
[02:24:22.586 --> 02:24:25.187]  Are you on a speakerphone, Joe?
[02:24:25.187 --> 02:24:25.647]  I'm not.
[02:24:25.647 --> 02:24:27.268]  No, I'm on a landline.
[02:24:27.268 --> 02:24:29.769]  I can barely... Go ahead.
[02:24:29.769 --> 02:24:31.169]  Okay.
[02:24:31.169 --> 02:24:36.492]  In our local newspaper last week, they're announcing a $30 million detention center
[02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:40.729]  That 12,000 people in this area are supposed to pay for.
[02:24:41.764 --> 02:24:43.966]  And I'm wondering if you've got any advice.
[02:24:43.966 --> 02:24:48.729]  We're having some upcoming local meetings where we can go and talk about this.
[02:24:48.729 --> 02:24:51.691]  I'm wondering if you were at this meeting, what would you do?
[02:24:51.691 --> 02:24:58.055]  What sort of things would you say in order to help the public awaken to maybe this is our potential FEMA camp?
[02:24:58.055 --> 02:24:58.956]  I don't know what it is.
[02:24:58.956 --> 02:25:01.217]  OK, OK, Brian, let me let me tell you how to beat it.
[02:25:01.217 --> 02:25:02.298]  And I appreciate your call.
[02:25:02.298 --> 02:25:11.284]  You go nearby to Hardin, Montana, and you show how they paid twenty seven million dollars for a facility three years ago that they completed that no one has ever been in.
[02:25:12.124 --> 02:25:12.965]  Okay, it's a big scam.
[02:25:25.367 --> 02:25:41.132]  And you also point out that we have more prisons per capita than any other country in the world, seven plus million people in the system, over five million behind bars, and that this is not the type of economic development you need in your city, in your town, and it's just that simple.
[02:25:41.132 --> 02:25:48.514]  That's our fastest growing industry, is government, and of that unit is detention centers, both public and private.
[02:25:48.514 --> 02:25:53.196]  And absolutely, I mean, it's a FEMA camp in the case of Tulia, Texas.
[02:25:53.196 --> 02:25:53.696]  The town
[02:25:55.011 --> 02:26:01.572]  Paid for, in that case I think it was only like seven million dollars, I'm going from memory, back in the late 80s to build it.
[02:26:01.572 --> 02:26:22.037]  Then there was no one to put in the detention center that the mayor and the police chief and others owned a stake in, and their families had the contracts for the upkeep, and they had family that were jail guards, and there was no one to pay for it, so they just started writing tickets, taking houses, planting drugs on people, and it turned out more than half of the black population of the town was in the jail.
[02:26:22.881 --> 02:26:24.843]  But also a lot of white people.
[02:26:24.843 --> 02:26:26.104]  So, I mean, it's simple.
[02:26:26.104 --> 02:26:30.607]  They just build prisons, hire cops, and start throwing us in them, and make money off of it.
[02:26:30.607 --> 02:26:33.189]  This is how they've legalized slavery.
[02:26:33.189 --> 02:26:34.670]  And they call it law and order.
[02:26:34.670 --> 02:26:37.533]  Meanwhile, the illegal aliens are all above the law.
[02:26:37.533 --> 02:26:39.454]  Let's talk to Jeff in Nevada.
[02:26:39.454 --> 02:26:40.215]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[02:26:41.576 --> 02:26:50.825]  Yes, Alex, I am probably a bigger sports fan than you, but I haven't actually tuned into an NBA game for a while.
[02:26:50.825 --> 02:27:00.355]  I tuned into one last night, and I'll tell you, I could not think of a better example of what Alan Watt would call predictive programming.
[02:27:01.011 --> 02:27:06.197]  They actually had Grant Hill on a commercial pushing vaccines for teens.
[02:27:06.197 --> 02:27:13.144]  Oh yeah, it's vaccines, it's Prozac, it's military ads, it's brainwashing, it's terror updates.
[02:27:13.144 --> 02:27:21.654]  It's all part of, and again, I'm a sports fan too, but I can't spend my time on that because we're going to hell in a handbasket and it's all a bunch of programming.
[02:27:23.016 --> 02:27:30.418]  It's almost like you're watching a commercial for the New World Order mixed between possessions of the basketball.
[02:27:30.418 --> 02:27:32.579]  I mean, I was absolutely horrified.
[02:27:32.579 --> 02:27:37.181]  Sir, that's why I can't watch television even for relaxation now, because I see the propaganda.
[02:27:37.181 --> 02:27:38.841]  And once you're awake, you will see it.
[02:27:38.841 --> 02:27:45.103]  And it's like a movie in the 80s of a futuristic 2010 police state.
[02:27:45.103 --> 02:27:46.144]  It's like The Running Man.
[02:27:46.144 --> 02:27:50.425]  The ads on TV from The Running Man are the ads that are on TV now.
[02:27:52.009 --> 02:27:56.842]  Alex, if it wasn't so serious where people's lives were at stake...
[02:27:57.769 --> 02:27:58.950]  You would think it was a joke.
[02:27:58.950 --> 02:28:05.756]  You would think that they were doing this as just some massive joke to make fun of the whole idea.
[02:28:05.756 --> 02:28:07.257]  Well, that is a massive joke.
[02:28:07.257 --> 02:28:14.703]  It is a massive joke for those that are awake and aware, but for people that think the government likes them and everything's fun.
[02:28:14.703 --> 02:28:17.726]  Oh, the government's going to take my pension fund for the banks?
[02:28:17.726 --> 02:28:18.667]  Oh, goody!
[02:28:18.667 --> 02:28:20.868]  You know, it's oh, goody!
[02:28:20.868 --> 02:28:23.471]  Again, it's all designed for people that barely pay attention.
[02:28:23.471 --> 02:28:25.852]  That's why I said in the last three months they're going to bust militias.
[02:28:26.593 --> 02:28:32.936]  Was because I saw the preconditioning for it, and it's just for people kind of barely paying attention.
[02:28:32.936 --> 02:28:35.037]  What, the militia killed their cat?
[02:28:35.037 --> 02:28:36.578]  That sounds ridiculous to anybody else.
[02:28:36.578 --> 02:28:38.239]  Turns out it's not true.
[02:28:38.239 --> 02:28:41.340]  It was just meant to make you hate them.
[02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:42.841]  Oh, they wanted to kill cops.
[02:28:42.841 --> 02:28:45.502]  Again, it's designed to make cops hate the public.
[02:28:45.502 --> 02:28:50.385]  And so it's all just background noise because they know the average person isn't conscious.
[02:28:50.385 --> 02:28:51.745]  Go ahead.
[02:28:51.745 --> 02:28:52.626]  Tell me about what you saw.
[02:28:53.880 --> 02:28:58.183]  I'll tell you, well, basically I saw, they have their talking points.
[02:28:58.183 --> 02:29:01.185]  They've got, I was writing them down.
[02:29:01.185 --> 02:29:10.270]  I mean, I haven't done this before because I haven't tuned into the NBA recently, but they had Grant Hill with the vaccines for teens.
[02:29:10.270 --> 02:29:14.293]  They had Shaq and somebody else fill out your census form now.
[02:29:14.293 --> 02:29:16.134]  God only knows what they're using that for.
[02:29:16.863 --> 02:29:18.805]  Then of course they intermingle.
[02:29:18.805 --> 02:29:22.630]  They intermingle the military commercials in with all of this.
[02:29:22.630 --> 02:29:23.230]  Stay there!
[02:29:23.230 --> 02:29:23.691]  Stay there!
[02:29:23.691 --> 02:29:24.112]  Stay there!
[02:29:24.112 --> 02:29:25.713]  I want you to start without me interrupting.
[02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:28.530]  And see, I want to do a news and review show.
[02:29:28.530 --> 02:29:47.815]  I've said for a decade I'm going to do it, and I finally got the staff and the studios being built, where every day, but it's going to take money to have the staff doing this, grabbing propaganda clips, the messages in TV, in movies, in sitcoms, in dramas, then the ads are all brainwashing, just to randomly pick an hour of TV and show people the programming.
[02:29:47.815 --> 02:29:51.556]  And it's getting worse, because they're building up towards something.
[02:29:51.556 --> 02:29:52.956]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.956 --> 02:29:54.457]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.476 --> 02:30:00.979]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.979 --> 02:30:03.301]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:30:03.301 --> 02:30:05.662]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:30:05.662 --> 02:30:08.884]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:30:08.884 --> 02:30:13.987]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:30:13.987 --> 02:30:18.190]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:30:18.490 --> 02:30:20.972]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:30:20.972 --> 02:30:23.713]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:30:23.713 --> 02:30:26.635]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:30:26.635 --> 02:30:34.240]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:30:34.577 --> 02:30:39.902]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:30:39.902 --> 02:30:42.825]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:30:42.825 --> 02:30:46.509]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:30:46.509 --> 02:30:47.590]  And I got news for you.
[02:30:47.590 --> 02:30:48.931]  You're everyone else.
[02:30:48.931 --> 02:30:50.432]  Invisible Empire.

[02:31:00.882 --> 02:31:02.183]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:02.183 --> 02:31:07.768]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:31:07.768 --> 02:31:12.792]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:31:12.792 --> 02:31:17.837]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:31:18.357 --> 02:31:23.581]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:31:23.581 --> 02:31:30.705]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:31:30.705 --> 02:31:31.826]  And here's the best part.
[02:31:31.826 --> 02:31:38.170]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:31:38.490 --> 02:31:41.693]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:31:41.693 --> 02:31:43.914]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[02:31:44.855 --> 02:31:45.175]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:31:45.175 --> 02:31:48.498]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:31:48.498 --> 02:31:50.219]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:00.718 --> 02:32:06.043]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[02:32:06.043 --> 02:32:08.805]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[02:32:08.805 --> 02:32:14.129]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[02:32:14.129 --> 02:32:18.633]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfallWars.com.

[02:32:34.764 --> 02:32:36.625]  This film needs to be seen.

[02:32:57.972 --> 02:33:09.181]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:09.181 --> 02:33:16.186]  Okay, we're going to continue with Jeff, Jake, Tony, Muhammad, Pat, and others that are patiently holding.
[02:33:16.186 --> 02:33:18.688]  I'm going to get into the attacks on free speech that are happening.
[02:33:19.906 --> 02:33:24.550]  We're going to break down congressman in Illinois saying, I don't worry about the Constitution.
[02:33:24.550 --> 02:33:29.954]  Katherine Austen Fitz coming up in the next hour.
[02:33:29.954 --> 02:33:32.657]  But that's why I'm frustrated.
[02:33:32.657 --> 02:33:36.480]  And I tell you this every day because I can't watch all the television.
[02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:37.801]  I can't read all the news.
[02:33:37.801 --> 02:33:40.784]  I can't even cover everything that's going on.
[02:33:40.784 --> 02:33:44.006]  It's so much worse than I say.
[02:33:44.006 --> 02:33:47.049]  And they're just marinating people in propaganda.
[02:33:48.087 --> 02:33:54.934]  The sitcoms are all anti-family, anti-homeschool, anti-people that don't want to be vaccinated.
[02:33:54.934 --> 02:34:01.280]  There's ads everywhere for the human papilloma, Gardasil shot that admittedly has killed a bunch of people and doesn't even protect you from it.
[02:34:02.334 --> 02:34:05.135]  There's ads for Prozac everywhere.
[02:34:05.135 --> 02:34:08.516]  There's demonization of gun owners everywhere.
[02:34:08.516 --> 02:34:10.836]  There's promotion of world government everywhere.
[02:34:10.836 --> 02:34:13.377]  There's constant pushing of humans are bad.
[02:34:13.377 --> 02:34:22.699]  We've got to have the green economy and it's going to give you jobs when they know it does the opposite and is designed to destroy our industrial capacity on record.
[02:34:22.699 --> 02:34:24.500]  And that's not even the tip of the iceberg.
[02:34:24.500 --> 02:34:26.980]  It just goes on and on and on and on.
[02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:29.101]  My wife maybe once a week on
[02:34:31.721 --> 02:34:46.066]  You know, weeknight or something, she'll try to watch a movie or watch a sitcom, and she calls me in and goes, look, this whole show is about how a woman doesn't give her kids vaccines so they die, or this whole show is about how great abortions are, or this whole show is about how bad humans are.
[02:34:46.066 --> 02:34:47.626]  It's just everything.
[02:34:47.626 --> 02:34:54.708]  It's total propaganda, and the federal government spends tens of billions a year per program.
[02:34:54.708 --> 02:34:55.649]  I haven't added it all up.
[02:34:55.649 --> 02:34:56.589]  It's got to be a hundred billion.
[02:34:57.748 --> 02:35:04.415]  With billboards and TV ads and product placement, propaganda placement in the shows.
[02:35:04.415 --> 02:35:08.199]  And we are building the TV studio.
[02:35:08.199 --> 02:35:09.360]  It should be done in a month.
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:15.126]  It'll take a month to fit it all out, get it all set up with equipment because we're a small operation, but your support has allowed this.
[02:35:16.474 --> 02:35:34.096]  And then I want to hire one or two of the right people that know how to just go through the YouTube clips, go through TV, pick out some of the shows we want to focus on, and show lies on the nightly news, propaganda in ads, cashless society propaganda, environment propaganda, world government pro-
[02:35:36.035 --> 02:35:45.838]  You know, tyranny military ads, weird military ads showing martial law is a good thing, local newscasts promoting urban warfare takeover drills.
[02:35:45.838 --> 02:35:52.240]  I mean, TV saying mercury is good for kids, melamine is good for kids.
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:53.220]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:35:53.220 --> 02:36:00.622]  I mean, I can watch any program, any show, except for Jesse Ventura's conspiracy theory.
[02:36:00.622 --> 02:36:02.903]  And Ventura doesn't know why they allowed this on air.
[02:36:06.417 --> 02:36:09.859]  I guess it's like a beta test or something.
[02:36:09.859 --> 02:36:11.119]  There's nothing on television.
[02:36:11.119 --> 02:36:21.065]  Well, I mean, every once in a while I'll see an MSNBC clip a month ago where they admitted, okay, $23.7 trillion has been stolen by the bank, so they won't say where it went, and this is horrible.
[02:36:21.065 --> 02:36:23.406]  So I guess that's what Ventura Show is, too.
[02:36:23.406 --> 02:36:29.869]  They allow just a few things to keep the illusion of objectivity.
[02:36:29.869 --> 02:36:30.770]  I don't even know what it is.
[02:36:33.012 --> 02:36:34.653]  We'll ask Ventura about that tomorrow.
[02:36:34.653 --> 02:36:35.934]  I know he's a good guy.
[02:36:35.934 --> 02:36:36.775]  I'm involved in the show.
[02:36:36.775 --> 02:36:45.963]  I'm in an even bigger role in consulting and on the program coming up in the next season.
[02:36:45.963 --> 02:36:50.286]  I look forward more to hanging out with Jesse because he's such a cool guy and so nice than I do even being in it.
[02:36:50.286 --> 02:36:58.753]  I almost don't even want to be in it because of the attention and all the jealousy it creates, but all I'm trying to do is wake people up, nothing more.
[02:36:58.753 --> 02:36:59.914]  I mean, it's a burden.
[02:37:01.462 --> 02:37:06.346]  This knowledge is a burden, but it's a greater burden to not stand up against it and know where this is leading.
[02:37:06.346 --> 02:37:12.911]  Jeff in Nevada, finish up your point about what you saw just watching a basketball game last night on TV.
[02:37:12.911 --> 02:37:24.620]  Well, Alex, they've got basically three or four talking points that mimic the same talking points that you see if you pick up USA Today.
[02:37:24.620 --> 02:37:27.082]  Military good, cops good,
[02:37:28.486 --> 02:37:31.467]  In particular, one ad caught my eye.
[02:37:31.467 --> 02:37:36.489]  It shows an older father leaning over his computer going, gee, my heart.
[02:37:36.489 --> 02:37:39.430]  There could be something a little bit more than just heart trouble.
[02:37:39.430 --> 02:37:40.971]  I might need this drug.
[02:37:40.971 --> 02:37:47.934]  And the daughter leans over onto his computer and real quick types it up and says, oh dad, your heart could be this, this, and this.
[02:37:47.934 --> 02:37:52.616]  You know, some new disease that they just invented to sell this drug.
[02:37:52.616 --> 02:37:54.876]  So that's another example.
[02:37:54.876 --> 02:37:56.037]  And then you'll also notice
[02:37:56.681 --> 02:37:56.801]  They
[02:38:13.789 --> 02:38:14.589]  Do it in reverse.
[02:38:33.257 --> 02:38:34.459]  Everyone's being targeted.
[02:38:34.459 --> 02:38:36.001]  They admit you're being targeted.
[02:38:36.001 --> 02:38:38.003]  And all I want people to do is become aware.
[02:38:38.003 --> 02:38:40.186]  I mean, look, you turn television on.
[02:38:40.186 --> 02:38:42.810]  They have an ad about face scanning to buy and sell, how great it is.
[02:38:42.810 --> 02:38:47.836]  The next ad is an idiot guy in a park with his girlfriend in this pastoral scene.
[02:38:47.836 --> 02:38:50.300]  It's a red, a red popsicle.
[02:38:50.700 --> 02:38:51.221]  We're good to go.
[02:39:08.943 --> 02:39:09.083]  Yes.
[02:39:25.618 --> 02:39:32.522]  Again, they have a TV ad because they know the women buy 80 plus percent of the food at the grocery store so that it's targeting women.
[02:39:32.522 --> 02:39:33.983]  You're smarter than your husband.
[02:39:33.983 --> 02:39:35.404]  He's an idiot.
[02:39:35.404 --> 02:39:38.646]  If he tells you that corn syrup's bad, he's a liar.
[02:39:38.646 --> 02:39:39.506]  Bring it to him.
[02:39:39.506 --> 02:39:41.688]  It will make you have power.
[02:39:41.688 --> 02:39:45.190]  Now, women, you shouldn't be insulted by me telling you how they're propagandizing you.
[02:39:45.190 --> 02:39:47.111]  You should be angry and upset.
[02:39:47.111 --> 02:39:48.452]  Go ahead and finish up your point, Jeff.
[02:39:49.409 --> 02:39:58.197]  Yes, Alex, there's two things that I would say to pay attention to, both of which Alan Watt has talked about periodically.
[02:39:58.197 --> 02:40:03.242]  One, when you're watching these TV programs, what they'll try is what you just pointed to.
[02:40:03.242 --> 02:40:06.785]  It's called Neurosociative Conditioning, the Pavlovian conditioning.
[02:40:07.205 --> 02:40:11.510]  They want to get you, they get you as a viewer, into a peak state.
[02:40:11.510 --> 02:40:17.237]  A Super Bowl, excuse me, a touchdown is scored, a basket is made at a critical time.
[02:40:17.237 --> 02:40:23.865]  When your nervous system is in that peak state of pleasure, now they're going to flash military, military, military.
[02:40:24.185 --> 02:40:26.526]  Now, does this mean that every guy in the military is bad?
[02:40:26.526 --> 02:40:34.310]  No, I'm not saying that, but what it does mean is that they are... No, but it's military propaganda scientifically being applied to the public without them knowing about it.
[02:40:34.310 --> 02:40:35.991]  This is the essence of mind control.
[02:40:35.991 --> 02:40:42.254]  Sounds like you've been in psyops, or are you a marketing psychologist?
[02:40:42.254 --> 02:40:43.074]  No, no, no.
[02:40:43.074 --> 02:40:44.235]  No, nothing like that.
[02:40:44.235 --> 02:40:49.057]  But, you know, I've just done a little bit of reading, and the thing is, what's very important is if you
[02:40:50.026 --> 02:40:58.114]  Listen to your show and listen to the guests that are on your show long enough, you start to see a lot of this is predictive programming.
[02:40:58.114 --> 02:41:05.062]  Even, for example, what they did with Plaxico Buress with his gun case and Tiger Woods in his case.
[02:41:05.062 --> 02:41:11.168]  What they're telling you in a mode of predictive programming is that you have no privacy.
[02:41:11.781 --> 02:41:15.903]  You know, if I was Tiger Woods, I would tell people, this is between me and my wife.
[02:41:15.903 --> 02:41:17.623]  This is none of your business!
[02:41:17.623 --> 02:41:18.824]  This is none of your business!
[02:41:18.824 --> 02:41:26.147]  I mean, if he'd have come out and said, at least I don't have underage prostitutes at my house like Barney Frank, you know, shut up!
[02:41:26.147 --> 02:41:35.911]  But no, they got him to play into the guilt, and I'm not saying what he did was good, the point is none of our business, and then they said, oh, he screwed up more, he's got to apologize more, and it teaches us that we have no privacy.
[02:41:35.911 --> 02:41:36.591]  Another great point.
[02:41:37.228 --> 02:41:37.829]  It teaches it.
[02:41:37.829 --> 02:41:38.530]  It teaches it.
[02:41:38.530 --> 02:41:43.275]  Now, there was a player from the Browns arrested for carrying a handgun.
[02:41:43.275 --> 02:41:43.996]  Unloaded!
[02:41:43.996 --> 02:41:45.277]  Unloaded!
[02:41:45.277 --> 02:41:49.982]  Unloaded and it creates the perception that all guns are illegal everywhere at all times.
[02:41:50.874 --> 02:41:58.001]  And you'll notice when you turn on ESPN, they show a very unflattering photograph of the guy caught with the gun.
[02:41:58.001 --> 02:41:59.423]  Ooh, he's caught with the gun.
[02:41:59.423 --> 02:42:07.951]  Now, I was proud of, there's one guy, Eric Casillas on ESPN, who actually stands up for, he stood up for Roethlisberger.
[02:42:07.951 --> 02:42:09.633]  He hasn't even been convicted yet.
[02:42:09.633 --> 02:42:11.575]  We don't even know the facts of the story.
[02:42:11.575 --> 02:42:13.237]  Everybody else on ESPN
[02:42:13.937 --> 02:42:14.998]  Wanted blood.
[02:42:14.998 --> 02:42:15.618]  Suspend him.
[02:42:15.618 --> 02:42:16.559]  Eliminate him.
[02:42:16.559 --> 02:42:17.580]  Get rid of this guy.
[02:42:17.580 --> 02:42:18.780]  You don't even know the facts.
[02:42:43.997 --> 02:42:46.958]  Great points, Jeff, I appreciate your call.
[02:42:46.958 --> 02:42:52.680]  You shouldn't wait for Alex Jones to do a TV show about this, which is, that's what I'm gonna do.
[02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:55.361]  That's TV show idea number one.
[02:42:55.361 --> 02:43:04.403]  You should start snipping clips of this, get a little cheap computer program, and once a week, call it Jeff's Review of Propaganda.
[02:43:04.403 --> 02:43:06.044]  This week we're looking at a sitcom.
[02:43:06.044 --> 02:43:07.424]  This week we're looking at ads.
[02:43:07.424 --> 02:43:08.785]  This week we're looking at news.
[02:43:08.785 --> 02:43:11.806]  It's all fair use, show clips, show the people.
[02:43:11.806 --> 02:43:12.486]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:43:13.266 --> 02:43:14.687]  I'm not here to do all this.
[02:43:14.687 --> 02:43:15.947]  I can't do it all.
[02:43:15.947 --> 02:43:19.929]  And I'm not somebody who has good ideas and then hoards them to myself.
[02:43:19.929 --> 02:43:23.051]  I'm somebody who has ideas to beat these people and I say, here it is, here it is.
[02:43:23.051 --> 02:43:24.591]  Use it, use it, use it, use it.
[02:43:24.591 --> 02:43:26.672]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[02:43:26.672 --> 02:43:29.193]  Because the water's rising in this chamber.
[02:43:29.193 --> 02:43:33.315]  We're going to drown politically if we don't break out of here together, okay?
[02:43:33.315 --> 02:43:36.477]  So I'm over here at the door lock trying to force it.
[02:43:36.877 --> 02:43:49.203]  And I'm saying, help me, I'm not strong enough, help me, please, please get Invisible Empire on DVD, please, please get Police State 4 so we can prove they're FEMA camps, so people understand how it all ties together in the big picture.
[02:43:49.203 --> 02:43:54.566]  Please, just get the film, make copies, get it out to people, please help us, please support us, please help us turn this thing.
[02:44:01.496 --> 02:44:04.660]  Because talking to Jeff just gave me a headache.
[02:44:04.660 --> 02:44:16.113]  Jeff's a great caller, intelligent, the type of caller we want who's informed and active and has done his research and he did some research and knew all the scientific terms of Pavlovian operant conditioning and other systems.
[02:44:19.229 --> 02:44:27.536]  It gave me a headache because it made my mind flash with all the other data I had on this, and then it also made me sick and angry at the establishment.
[02:44:27.536 --> 02:44:41.188]  I mean, having psychological warfare programming, actual brainwashing, the same stuff 60 years ago they'd have on movie screens in the Soviet Union inside a camp where they were breaking people.
[02:44:42.594 --> 02:44:59.000]  I mean, to read all over the country where the police come in and take over unannounced elementary schools, dressed up in camo and say, we're the homeschoolers against public school, we're here to kill you, and the children defecate, they urinate, they pass out, teachers end up going to loony bins.
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:00.460]  They tell them it's real for hours.
[02:45:00.460 --> 02:45:01.660]  They throw blood on them.
[02:45:01.660 --> 02:45:03.881]  They put them on the ground and say, I'm going to blow your head off.
[02:45:03.881 --> 02:45:05.402]  Unannounced.
[02:45:05.402 --> 02:45:06.202]  In many of the drills.
[02:45:08.376 --> 02:45:12.639]  That is a hardcore brainwashing operation.
[02:45:12.639 --> 02:45:14.700]  I mean, that is scarring these children.
[02:45:14.700 --> 02:45:21.664]  Then they tell the parents, well, we're worried about malicious.
[02:45:21.664 --> 02:45:24.446]  In fact, search this.
[02:45:24.446 --> 02:45:28.168]  One of the worst cases, but we learned it's happening nationwide, but where people actually complain, so we learned about it.
[02:45:28.168 --> 02:45:35.292]  It was about four years ago, and it was in the Associated Press.
[02:45:35.292 --> 02:45:36.193]  Pull up the term,
[02:45:39.226 --> 02:45:40.426]  It's mentally exhausting doing this.
[02:45:40.426 --> 02:45:41.487]  I'm not complaining.
[02:45:41.487 --> 02:45:43.727]  It's just that it's starting to weigh on me, folks.
[02:45:43.727 --> 02:45:44.748]  The level of knowledge.
[02:45:44.748 --> 02:45:46.388]  And if you research, you'd have this knowledge too.
[02:45:46.388 --> 02:45:48.909]  And it's just, it's just, it's like, please wake up.
[02:45:48.909 --> 02:45:51.090]  Please see what's happening.
[02:45:51.090 --> 02:45:58.472]  Parents angry over Michigan security drill.
[02:46:02.679 --> 02:46:11.784]  And in the article it talks about, they came in, and it's happened in Texas, and it's happened in, we've had the teachers on, we've had their lawyers on, it's happened in Minneapolis-St.
[02:46:11.784 --> 02:46:18.407]  Paul, they took the elementary kids out, the back of the school, said we're going to kill you in the forest.
[02:46:18.407 --> 02:46:21.729]  And I had to sit here and think, we're doing that to stop mass shootings.
[02:46:21.729 --> 02:46:23.390]  We've got to naked body scan you.
[02:46:23.390 --> 02:46:25.311]  We've got to take your blood at checkpoints.
[02:46:25.311 --> 02:46:29.593]  They want to get into your comfort zone, get into your space, train you, you have no privacy.
[02:46:34.724 --> 02:46:39.629]  This is psychological warfare, and it conditions the cops to do this.
[02:46:39.629 --> 02:46:42.732]  Everybody's being conditioned.
[02:46:42.732 --> 02:46:54.944]  All right, I'm gonna go to Jake, Tony, Muhammad, Pat, Daryl, and others before our guest gets on, and I have to get into all this free speech news and the rest of it, but I'll cover some of that with her.
[02:46:54.944 --> 02:46:58.487]  There it is, Michigan high school students terrorizing police state security drill.
[02:46:58.487 --> 02:46:59.348]  Is that five years old?
[02:47:02.133 --> 02:47:02.393]  It is.
[02:47:02.393 --> 02:47:04.514]  Okay, print it and it'll have an AP link in it.
[02:47:04.514 --> 02:47:06.795]  See if the AP link or search under that term.
[02:47:06.795 --> 02:47:07.736]  That's natural news.
[02:47:07.736 --> 02:47:08.496]  Great source of info.
[02:47:08.496 --> 02:47:10.637]  We want to show people actual AP.
[02:47:10.637 --> 02:47:11.638]  Splattering blood on them.
[02:47:11.638 --> 02:47:13.999]  Blowing a truck up in front of them.
[02:47:13.999 --> 02:47:15.580]  And again, you're tuning in going, this didn't happen.
[02:47:15.580 --> 02:47:16.260]  Yes, it did.
[02:47:16.260 --> 02:47:16.900]  Okay?
[02:47:16.900 --> 02:47:18.281]  Yes, it did.
[02:47:18.281 --> 02:47:19.222]  Okay?
[02:47:19.222 --> 02:47:19.842]  That's my point.
[02:47:19.842 --> 02:47:22.463]  It's going on everywhere.
[02:47:22.463 --> 02:47:24.484]  They're taking their children away from you.
[02:47:24.484 --> 02:47:27.586]  If you did that to your kids, they'd take your kids away from you and arrest you and they should.
[02:47:28.547 --> 02:47:30.948]  You came in and said you were going to blow their head off, put a gun to their head.
[02:47:30.948 --> 02:47:34.589]  But they're training you that if you naked body scanned your kids, you'd get in trouble.
[02:47:34.589 --> 02:47:38.070]  But the state says they can do it.
[02:47:38.070 --> 02:47:40.951]  They're training the preachers to tell their flocks to go to FEMA camps.
[02:47:40.951 --> 02:47:42.531]  You cannot make this up.
[02:47:42.531 --> 02:47:44.031]  Now I want to briefly go to Ted Anderson.
[02:47:44.031 --> 02:47:47.973]  I hope you listen up carefully because we're only going to spend a few minutes on this.
[02:47:47.973 --> 02:47:54.735]  The banks have done everything they can to drive gold down, but it's up, what, more than $10 in the last week.
[02:47:57.094 --> 02:48:03.759]  It's at $1,133.10.
[02:48:03.759 --> 02:48:10.604]  And Ted still has gold and silver he bought back when gold was at the $1,050 level.
[02:48:10.604 --> 02:48:15.548]  And on top of it, he'll throw in a free international forecast for your subscription, $159 value.
[02:48:15.548 --> 02:48:21.933]  And the tiny amount of money he makes from this, because he bought it at a lower price, sells it low when it's high, supports the network.
[02:48:21.933 --> 02:48:22.874]  You can't get a better deal.
[02:48:22.874 --> 02:48:25.216]  He's got a bunch of other coins he's offering.
[02:48:25.216 --> 02:48:26.737]  Ted, tell folks about today's offers.
[02:48:27.188 --> 02:48:27.749]  Yeah, sure.
[02:48:27.749 --> 02:48:30.231]  As a matter of fact, I can do even a little bit better.
[02:48:30.231 --> 02:48:33.734]  It was $261.61 last time I offered the franc.
[02:48:33.734 --> 02:48:35.036]  Gold is up.
[02:48:35.036 --> 02:48:39.400]  I've dropped my price on the franc down to $249.68.
[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:41.802]  So the price of the franc is actually lower.
[02:48:41.802 --> 02:48:45.666]  It gets it down to $90.68 after you consider the $159 discount for the forecaster subscription.
[02:48:50.390 --> 02:48:54.654]  Totals $453.40 an ounce for gold.
[02:48:54.654 --> 02:48:59.718]  I mean, we're both looking at gold right now at $1,135 an ounce.
[02:48:59.718 --> 02:49:02.300]  That's a steal.
[02:49:02.300 --> 02:49:10.947]  Unbelievable, the one-ounce Silver Sovereigns coming out of the Montana Silver People, they are selling like hotcakes right now, so I'd really recommend those.
[02:49:10.947 --> 02:49:15.470]  Get involved with those as well.
[02:49:15.470 --> 02:49:19.874]  When organizations stand up for liberty, people support it, and I really appreciate that.
[02:49:20.718 --> 02:49:24.960]  The British Sovereign is currently at $312.42.
[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:27.381]  Again, that's a lower price.
[02:49:27.381 --> 02:49:37.045]  I picked up most of this stuff when gold was down there at that $1,083 level, and now we're looking at $1,135, so this is really a good buy.
[02:49:37.045 --> 02:49:46.449]  And I would suggest that people get involved, but really, if you haven't had a chance to get your economic newsletter subscription yet, that International Forecaster is really good.
[02:49:47.189 --> 02:49:55.638]  And again, it's $159 for a year, but all you have to do is pick up the one franc for $249.68, and that's it.
[02:49:55.638 --> 02:49:58.761]  We'll buy it for you for a full year.
[02:49:58.761 --> 02:50:04.146]  Absolutely, but folks, I wouldn't just buy one fifth ounce franc and get the newsletter.
[02:50:04.146 --> 02:50:09.351]  I would get some of those other coins and offers in gold and silver because they are fabulous deals.
[02:50:09.351 --> 02:50:10.493]  Every few months when I buy,
[02:50:11.761 --> 02:50:16.283]  A quarter ounce coin or something, or a couple silver coins.
[02:50:16.283 --> 02:50:18.685]  I get it from Ted Anderson, and I've shopped around.
[02:50:18.685 --> 02:50:23.107]  This is a wonderful deal, and he's a patriot, and he's been around for 30 plus years.
[02:50:23.107 --> 02:50:23.828]  Midas for more than 12.
[02:50:23.828 --> 02:50:23.888]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:23.888 --> 02:50:25.408]  800-686-2237, or MidasResources.com.
[02:50:25.408 --> 02:50:26.169]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:26.169 --> 02:50:27.490]  And to get those special deals,
[02:50:41.516 --> 02:50:42.877]  He was offering.
[02:50:42.877 --> 02:50:46.639]  You need to tell him Alex Jones sent you as part of his special to get that deal.
[02:50:46.639 --> 02:50:46.980]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:46.980 --> 02:50:52.443]  Here's the number again.
[02:50:52.443 --> 02:50:52.743]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:52.743 --> 02:50:56.726]  Don't procrastinate.
[02:50:56.726 --> 02:51:00.268]  Protect yourself from the bankers and their fiat currency and paper today.
[02:51:00.268 --> 02:51:00.669]  Thanks, Ted.
[02:51:01.929 --> 02:51:02.510]  Fact!
[02:51:02.510 --> 02:51:02.690]  Fact!
[02:51:02.690 --> 02:51:02.810]  Fact!
[02:51:16.949 --> 02:51:21.152]  One in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[02:51:21.152 --> 02:51:25.695]  Fact, anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[02:52:03.815 --> 02:52:06.136]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:06.136 --> 02:52:09.337]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:09.337 --> 02:52:14.439]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.439 --> 02:52:18.620]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.940 --> 02:52:21.402]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.402 --> 02:52:24.183]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:24.183 --> 02:52:27.105]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:27.105 --> 02:52:34.690]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:35.030 --> 02:52:40.415]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.415 --> 02:52:43.277]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:43.277 --> 02:52:46.960]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.960 --> 02:52:48.041]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:48.041 --> 02:52:49.382]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:49.382 --> 02:52:50.883]  Invisible Empire.

[02:54:03.273 --> 02:54:14.740]  What the Feds do is, this is done all over the world, it's all globally standardized at the UN level, is they put out MYAC and Homeland Security reports demonizing homeschoolers, Christians, conservatives,
[02:54:15.970 --> 02:54:16.871]  Returning veterans.
[02:54:16.871 --> 02:54:21.795]  And then they go out and bust groups led by feds and send them to prison.
[02:54:21.795 --> 02:54:26.339]  And they just set them up to then have it on the news that a group was planning to attack a school.
[02:54:26.339 --> 02:54:28.640]  They were planning to attack a police station.
[02:54:28.640 --> 02:54:31.823]  They were planning to blow up the Capitol.
[02:54:31.823 --> 02:54:34.705]  And so this is part of reality management.
[02:54:34.705 --> 02:54:37.308]  But we did pull up the AP article.
[02:54:37.308 --> 02:54:40.070]  Michigan School District portrays homeschoolers as terrorists.
[02:54:41.587 --> 02:54:50.592]  A simulated attack by a fictitious radical group called Wackos against schools and education who believes everyone should be homeschooled.
[02:54:50.592 --> 02:54:57.996]  And actually, punch up the article from Infowars.com on screen for people, because that one has the AP parts excised out, so does this article.
[02:54:57.996 --> 02:55:02.459]  Or not excised, pulled out and added to our article.
[02:55:02.459 --> 02:55:06.041]  And it goes on, they came and blew up a car, told the kids it was real.
[02:55:07.490 --> 02:55:09.591]  Uh, it said homeschoolers were coming to kill the kids.
[02:55:09.591 --> 02:55:13.592]  It was part of a Homeland Security grant.
[02:55:13.592 --> 02:55:23.834]  The Muskogon Area Intermediate School District partnered with the Muskogon County Emergency Services as part of a Homeland Security grant.
[02:55:23.834 --> 02:55:26.915]  Michigan High School students terrorized in police state security drill.
[02:55:28.015 --> 02:55:37.440]  And here's the school's press release, Michigan.gov, school lockdown, shelter in place, drill policy, and it says we're going to continue this at all schools twice a year.
[02:55:37.440 --> 02:55:44.623]  This is after more complaints happened in January 9, 2007.
[02:55:44.623 --> 02:55:47.025]  Here's Dyncor running the CPS grabbing rings.
[02:55:47.025 --> 02:55:49.606]  Dyncor's been caught worldwide in child kidnapping.
[02:55:49.606 --> 02:55:52.928]  That's Congressional Reports, but they run things here in Texas.
[02:55:52.928 --> 02:55:56.229]  We're going to talk about that some coming up in the next hour.
[02:55:56.229 --> 02:55:57.750]  Yeah, it's not a game, is it?
[02:55:59.773 --> 02:56:01.874]  They think of you as a bunch of stupid monkeys.
[02:56:01.874 --> 02:56:03.174]  They can just program.
[02:56:03.174 --> 02:56:06.835]  But if you're conscious of the programming, you can break free from it.
[02:56:06.835 --> 02:56:08.715]  Let's talk to Jake in Wisconsin.
[02:56:08.715 --> 02:56:10.396]  Jake, you're on the air.
[02:56:10.396 --> 02:56:11.996]  Hey Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:56:11.996 --> 02:56:13.556]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:56:13.556 --> 02:56:19.438]  I was calling to see if you have ever read the MSDS, or Material Safety Data Sheet, on sodium fluoride.
[02:56:20.549 --> 02:56:22.290]  Yes, they say it attacks all the organs.
[02:56:22.290 --> 02:56:23.650]  It's incredible deadly poison.
[02:56:23.650 --> 02:56:25.511]  If you get any of it in you, it's horrible.
[02:56:25.511 --> 02:56:26.891]  It's a cumulative poison.
[02:56:26.891 --> 02:56:30.752]  So even small exposures over time are incredibly hazardous.
[02:56:30.752 --> 02:56:32.653]  And that's why they put it in the water.
[02:56:32.653 --> 02:56:34.033]  But I mean, tell folks what it says.
[02:56:34.033 --> 02:56:35.614]  Tell folks what it says.
[02:56:35.614 --> 02:56:50.298]  Well, for those of you who don't know, a material safety data sheet on a job site or a warehouse or whatever, if you have chemicals, you have to have a material safety data sheet for any chemicals you have on site so the people know what to do with it.
[02:56:50.976 --> 02:56:54.698]  In case they come into contact or a spill happens, what have you.
[02:56:54.698 --> 02:57:15.532]  Okay, the first part is relatively benign, but when you get to the fourth page, section 11, it starts talking about toxicological information, roots of entry, inhalation and ingestion, mutagenic effects, mutagenic for mammalian somatic cells, mutagenic for bacteria,
[02:57:16.777 --> 02:57:33.666]  And by the way, the main mammalian cells are breast tissue and testicular tissue, because those have the highest fluctuation of hormone fluctuations, and so they target that, and if you read the literature, that's why it attacks your reproductive circuit.
[02:57:33.666 --> 02:57:34.506]  Go ahead.
[02:57:34.506 --> 02:57:40.449]  Yeah, they also have, page 5, special remarks on toxic effects on humans.
[02:57:40.449 --> 02:57:43.791]  And they have it broken down by organ systems.
[02:57:43.791 --> 02:57:45.332]  Skin causes skin irritation.
[02:57:45.914 --> 02:57:46.174]  Eyes.
[02:57:46.174 --> 02:57:48.756]  Causes eye irritation and burns.
[02:57:48.756 --> 02:57:49.316]  Ingestion.
[02:57:49.316 --> 02:57:50.737]  Harmful or swallowed.
[02:57:50.737 --> 02:57:53.319]  Causes digestive tract irritation and burns.
[02:57:53.319 --> 02:57:56.901]  May cause severe and permanent damage to the digestive tract.
[02:57:56.901 --> 02:58:12.391]  Ingestion of large amounts may cause salivation, thirst, nausea, vomiting, hypermolatility, diarrhea, abdominal pain, behavioral, central nervous system damage, respiratory damage, cardiovascular system damage, liver, urinary,
[02:58:13.012 --> 02:58:16.117]  There is absolutely nothing here that it doesn't attack.
[02:58:16.117 --> 02:58:18.561]  It's just terrible and then they put it in our water.
[02:58:18.561 --> 02:58:21.906]  But if you spill some at work, you'd have to call a hazmat team.
[02:58:23.922 --> 02:58:25.423]  But we're conspiracy theorists.
[02:58:25.423 --> 02:58:28.205]  It doesn't matter if we have Russian, Nazi, and U.S.
[02:58:28.205 --> 02:58:32.669]  government documents where they say they put it in the water to sterilize and brain damage us.
[02:58:32.669 --> 02:58:33.669]  But the government's good.
[02:58:33.669 --> 02:58:34.810]  I'm glad they're running healthcare.
[02:58:34.810 --> 02:58:36.651]  They're gonna take good care of us now.
[02:58:36.651 --> 02:58:39.554]  Come on, you shouldn't read that information.
[02:58:39.554 --> 02:58:41.615]  It's good for you.
[02:58:41.615 --> 02:58:47.319]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:47.319 --> 02:58:50.542]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:51.752 --> 02:58:54.774]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:54.774 --> 02:59:00.097]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:59:00.097 --> 02:59:02.138]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:02.138 --> 02:59:07.140]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:07.140 --> 02:59:08.341]  How much do you want?
[02:59:08.341 --> 02:59:09.462]  When do you want it?
[02:59:09.462 --> 02:59:11.343]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:11.343 --> 02:59:12.423]  When will you need it?
[02:59:12.423 --> 02:59:14.624]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:14.624 --> 02:59:15.965]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:15.965 --> 02:59:17.266]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:17.486 --> 02:59:22.732]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:22.732 --> 02:59:26.335]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:26.335 --> 02:59:30.160]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:30.160 --> 02:59:31.381]  How much will you need?
[02:59:31.381 --> 02:59:32.282]  We don't know.
[02:59:32.282 --> 02:59:33.383]  How much do you want?
[02:59:33.383 --> 02:59:34.324]  All you can get.
[02:59:34.324 --> 02:59:35.125]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:35.405 --> 02:59:38.446]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:38.446 --> 02:59:40.687]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:40.687 --> 02:59:41.688]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:41.688 --> 02:59:42.868]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.868 --> 02:59:44.689]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:07.031 --> 03:00:08.773]  It's already the final hour.
[03:00:08.773 --> 03:00:13.056]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday edition.
[03:00:13.056 --> 03:00:22.745]  Katherine Austen-Fitz to talk about the economy, the police state, the New World Order, the nature of the elites is coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:22.745 --> 03:00:24.306]  Let's go ahead and take some more calls.
[03:00:24.306 --> 03:00:28.010]  Tony in Canada, you're on the air.
[03:00:28.010 --> 03:00:28.770]  Hello?
[03:00:28.770 --> 03:00:29.811]  Yes, sir.
[03:00:29.811 --> 03:00:31.172]  Hey, how you doing, boss?
[03:00:31.172 --> 03:00:32.734]  All right.
[03:00:32.734 --> 03:00:33.054]  Perfect.
[03:00:33.890 --> 03:00:38.953]  I was doing a lot of research over the past year because of all the information you guys have been providing.
[03:00:38.953 --> 03:00:40.855]  Of course, everybody's thankful for that.
[03:00:40.855 --> 03:00:42.416]  We do appreciate it.
[03:00:42.416 --> 03:00:52.141]  But I haven't been hearing a lot of information about security companies like Converse Technology, and Verint, and Nice Systems, as well as Norris.
[03:00:52.141 --> 03:01:02.328]  Well, they're a revolving door in homeland security, and it's the same in Europe, where when somebody's in homeland security, they give them the contracts, and then five years later, they move into that company as an executive.
[03:01:03.198 --> 03:01:26.656]  Absolutely, and one of the biggest issues is that Congress, the headquarters is in Israel, as well as all these other sub-companies or umbrella companies like Verint and Norris and all these other companies, but they have contracts now with American telecom communication companies and now each and every single telephone across North America is linked to Israeli intelligence through this system because it's all in the back of Congress.
[03:01:26.656 --> 03:01:27.497]  That's been for 10 years.
[03:01:28.393 --> 03:01:30.554]  That's been for 10 years, absolutely.
[03:01:30.554 --> 03:01:32.155]  Because then they can get around U.S.
[03:01:32.155 --> 03:01:38.077]  laws because a foreign government is doing the spying and then giving it back to the NSA.
[03:01:38.077 --> 03:01:41.819]  They claim it doesn't get around the law, it just hides the criminality.
[03:01:42.819 --> 03:01:44.260]  No, exactly, exactly.
[03:01:44.260 --> 03:02:03.531]  And if you do research far enough, at least all the way back down to Sourcefire, which their major clients are American Defense Department, the National Security Department, and a lot of these people think that when they go online and they think that they're safe through these security companies, but one of the major companies that I found that was connected to these things is VeriFind.
[03:02:03.531 --> 03:02:07.533]  Now, VeriFind deals with most of the majority of the credit card securities
[03:02:08.113 --> 03:02:13.678]  And the government can raise up the tech companies they want to be preeminent by giving them the contracts.
[03:02:13.678 --> 03:02:14.378]  Great point, Tony.
[03:02:14.378 --> 03:02:16.039]  Mohammed in Colorado, you're on the air.
[03:02:36.465 --> 03:02:44.638]  Hey, so, I, um, I don't know if anybody mentioned this on the Friday or Sunday show, but I just went to go see, uh, the new Clash of the Titans movie yesterday.
[03:02:45.433 --> 03:02:57.699]  And unlike the 80's show that's all about some dude that's left-struck and going to fight things, this one, to me, was really almost like an allegory for the current state of the U.S.
[03:02:57.699 --> 03:03:08.745]  So, in the movie, you've got these titans that are defeated by their sons, the gods, and the gods make people, human beings, to pray to them in order for them to kind of live forever.
[03:03:09.660 --> 03:03:15.123]  And so the people become very distraught with the tyranny of the Titans and kind of rebel.
[03:03:15.123 --> 03:03:20.385]  And so they release this Kraken that's supposed to kind of put the people back in check.
[03:03:20.385 --> 03:03:24.767]  And halfway through the movie, I immediately thought, you know, this is kind of like the U.S.
[03:03:24.767 --> 03:03:27.948]  You've got... Yeah, Ben Laden is the Kraken.
[03:03:27.948 --> 03:03:28.609]  Absolutely.
[03:03:28.609 --> 03:03:29.869]  Right?
[03:03:29.869 --> 03:03:31.090]  Release the Kraken.
[03:03:33.333 --> 03:03:42.097]  You've got people who fled from England, the tyranny in England, you know, and so these are represented by the gods.
[03:03:42.097 --> 03:03:46.699]  And so the gods set up a government for the people.
[03:03:46.699 --> 03:03:49.360]  And you're supposed to pay your taxes to the government.
[03:03:49.360 --> 03:03:53.302]  And right now, in the current state, the government's becoming tyrannical.
[03:03:53.302 --> 03:03:58.504]  And so people are just kind of taking a stand, saying, no, no, we're not going to really put up with this tyranny.
[03:03:58.504 --> 03:04:01.225]  And so the government's like, release the Kraken, you know, onto the people.
[03:04:02.212 --> 03:04:07.734]  And so, halfway through the movie, I really just started to realize, you know, this is really almost about America.
[03:04:07.734 --> 03:04:21.017]  Well, George Lucas said that episode three, Revenge of the Sith, is where the senator becomes the president, then the ruler, by staging terror attacks and outside military attacks on himself.
[03:04:21.017 --> 03:04:27.539]  And many of the terrorist armies he's running don't even know that they're not really going to win in the end.
[03:04:27.539 --> 03:04:30.820]  And Lucas said, no, no, this is what our government really does do.
[03:04:31.440 --> 03:04:33.881]  He's definitely a 9-11 truther.
[03:04:33.881 --> 03:04:36.701]  So, absolutely, that's what's going on.
[03:04:36.701 --> 03:04:37.882]  Yeah, so I'd throw it out there.
[03:04:37.882 --> 03:04:43.563]  Anybody that wants to, you know, take a moment or leave yourself with some... Was it a good movie overall?
[03:04:43.563 --> 03:04:45.004]  Overall, it's a pretty good movie.
[03:04:45.004 --> 03:04:51.005]  And that message, that allegory is very overt, so it doesn't take a lot of digging to really realize that.
[03:04:51.005 --> 03:04:52.106]  So it's worth checking out.
[03:04:52.106 --> 03:04:53.526]  It's entertaining.
[03:04:53.526 --> 03:04:57.607]  Well, I don't watch a lot of films, but I may have to go watch it so we can do a review here.
[03:04:57.607 --> 03:04:59.728]  Plus, I like escapism occasionally.
[03:05:01.343 --> 03:05:02.644]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.644 --> 03:05:08.229]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:05:08.229 --> 03:05:13.253]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:05:13.253 --> 03:05:18.298]  It's true, seeds did not perform even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:05:18.818 --> 03:05:24.042]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:05:24.042 --> 03:05:31.168]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:05:31.168 --> 03:05:32.289]  And here's the best part.
[03:05:32.289 --> 03:05:38.654]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[03:05:45.641 --> 03:05:48.965]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:05:48.965 --> 03:05:50.687]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:06:02.895 --> 03:06:06.856]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:06.856 --> 03:06:15.739]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:06:15.739 --> 03:06:20.360]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:06:20.360 --> 03:06:31.184]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:06:31.804 --> 03:06:41.306]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:41.306 --> 03:06:46.748]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[03:07:05.037 --> 03:07:06.299]  Tyranny is here.
[03:07:06.299 --> 03:07:10.243]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:07:10.243 --> 03:07:12.626]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:07:12.626 --> 03:07:18.353]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:07:18.353 --> 03:07:24.601]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:07:25.001 --> 03:07:30.945]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:07:30.945 --> 03:07:35.148]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[03:07:35.148 --> 03:07:39.451]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:07:39.451 --> 03:07:45.395]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[03:07:45.395 --> 03:07:48.317]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:07:48.937 --> 03:07:50.919]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:07:50.919 --> 03:07:52.040]  It's here.

[03:08:06.913 --> 03:08:09.215]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:20.789 --> 03:08:24.292]  Well, for the balance of the hour, Catherine Austin Fitch is our guest.
[03:08:24.292 --> 03:08:29.517]  We're going to cover a whole host of different issues with her today.
[03:08:29.517 --> 03:08:39.785]  She's with Solari.com Investment Advisor, founder and managing member of Solari Investment Advisory Services, LLC.
[03:08:39.785 --> 03:08:43.288]  It's spelled S-O-L-A-R-I.com.
[03:08:43.288 --> 03:08:47.251]  Catherine has designed and closed over 25 billion of transactions and investments
[03:08:48.152 --> 03:08:53.414]  to date and has led portfolio strategy for $300 billion of financial assets and liabilities.
[03:08:53.414 --> 03:08:57.836]  We recently interviewed her for her upcoming film, Fall of the Republic 2.
[03:08:57.836 --> 03:09:00.117]  Catherine's experiences on Wall Street in Washington, D.C.
[03:09:00.117 --> 03:09:05.659]  are chronicled in Dylan Reed and the Aristocracy of Stock Portfolios.
[03:09:05.659 --> 03:09:17.244]  She's also a former government official, Assistant Secretary of Housing, Federal Housing Commissioner under Bush 1, Investment Banker, Managing Director and member of the board of Wall Street firm Dylan Reed & Co, Inc.
[03:09:18.064 --> 03:09:20.305]  And so it doesn't get any more elite than that.
[03:09:20.305 --> 03:09:24.028]  And she joins us for the next 51 minutes here today.
[03:09:24.028 --> 03:09:25.809]  Catherine, out of the gates.
[03:09:25.809 --> 03:09:31.432]  We're going to get into government health care and your take on what it does.
[03:09:31.432 --> 03:09:34.494]  But I first wanted to go to this Businessweek article.
[03:09:34.494 --> 03:09:38.236]  FDIC wants pension funds to prop up failed banks.
[03:09:38.236 --> 03:09:40.197]  And in fact, this isn't the Bloomberg.
[03:09:40.197 --> 03:09:40.618]  This is the
[03:09:43.482 --> 03:09:44.002]  Raw story.
[03:09:44.002 --> 03:09:45.724]  I want the Bloomberg or Businessweek.
[03:09:45.724 --> 03:09:47.606]  I want to show people that one.
[03:09:47.606 --> 03:09:48.827]  This is basically the same article.
[03:09:48.827 --> 03:09:50.628]  I mean, here's a link to the Bloomberg News.
[03:09:50.628 --> 03:10:02.378]  I wanted to read the actual quotes where they're ordering, with this color of law, kind of like they ordered the banks to take the bailout, wink wink, to invest public and private pension funds, quote, in failed banks.
[03:10:02.378 --> 03:10:05.100]  Catherine Austin Fitz, what is all that about?
[03:10:05.100 --> 03:10:11.546]  Well, we have seen the pension funds over the last 10 to 20 years come under significant pressure
[03:10:12.290 --> 03:10:17.674]  To invest in a variety of things which have left the pension funds in real trouble.
[03:10:17.674 --> 03:10:19.355]  So, we have the pension funds.
[03:10:19.355 --> 03:10:25.860]  The pension funds, the American pension funds, were the key vehicle used to finance the housing bubble.
[03:10:25.860 --> 03:10:28.823]  And have gotten, you know, left holding the bag.
[03:10:28.823 --> 03:10:37.229]  And so, it is incredibly important, Alex, that pension funds have the legal protection and authority to finance
[03:10:38.035 --> 03:10:40.297]  You know, what is the right thing to do?
[03:10:40.297 --> 03:10:52.766]  And if there's one reform that needs to happen, it's a real investigation of why do the pension funds keep doing, you know, the scams, and how do you stop that?
[03:10:52.766 --> 03:11:00.372]  Because it's left, you know, we now have state and local governments and companies having to come up with new big pension fund payments because
[03:11:01.038 --> 03:11:03.880]  There's been too much political interference.
[03:11:03.880 --> 03:11:15.948]  I described... You've heard me tell the story where the president of the largest pension fund in the country, CalPERS, said to me in 1997 when I was trying to interest him in refinancing American communities, he said, it's too late.
[03:11:15.948 --> 03:11:16.629]  You don't understand.
[03:11:16.629 --> 03:11:17.690]  They've given up on the country.
[03:11:17.690 --> 03:11:20.752]  They're moving all the money out starting in the fall.
[03:11:20.752 --> 03:11:23.594]  And my question is, you know, well, who's they?
[03:11:23.594 --> 03:11:28.057]  And how can they order you as a pension fund board to just
[03:11:29.025 --> 03:11:44.428]  You know, do things with your money, and the reality is, if CalPERS had invested in the fundamental infrastructure and well-being of American communities and the American infrastructure, they would have lost a lot less money.
[03:11:45.290 --> 03:11:47.791]  You know, instead of losing it on the pump and dump.
[03:11:47.791 --> 03:11:52.793]  And we would have an infrastructure and a nation, but this is predatory.
[03:11:52.793 --> 03:12:00.396]  And again, you were there at the top of the pyramid watching this happen, trying to stop it on record, even at the time.
[03:12:00.396 --> 03:12:10.541]  So to be clear, we have the head NASA climatologist, we have the UN, we have all these world leaders, Bill Gates saying they want to destroy industrial society so they get you in debt.
[03:12:11.101 --> 03:12:15.683]  Get your local governments, pension funds, police, fire, you name it, to invest.
[03:12:15.683 --> 03:12:23.567]  They move it all offshore, then the country implodes, and then they come in with even more debt, then they take over health care, then they run your life.
[03:12:23.567 --> 03:12:23.947]  Go ahead.
[03:12:23.947 --> 03:12:26.508]  Right, so then they say your pension funds have lost all this money.
[03:12:26.508 --> 03:12:29.109]  Now, what's the FDIC up to?
[03:12:29.109 --> 03:12:34.352]  The last person who should be telling the pension funds what they should invest in is the FDIC.
[03:12:34.352 --> 03:12:35.292]  Now, I say that
[03:12:35.931 --> 03:12:47.096]  And Alex, what you need to know is, you know, the patterns appear that lots of small banks are being targeted in a way that's ending up providing subsidy to the people who pick them up.
[03:12:47.096 --> 03:13:03.424]  In other words, we have a double standard in enforcement by the banking regulators so the big banks who've been doing all the improper things get bailed out and the small banks who've been well-managed are getting targeted and taken over in a way that subsidized the big banks.
[03:13:04.156 --> 03:13:14.526]  So, you have to be careful behind here, you know, that we don't see the FDIC driving the small banks into pension funds in a way that is part of an economic warfare game.
[03:13:14.526 --> 03:13:25.036]  And my fear is, you know, the next thing you know, you see state and local government pension funds financing someone like Soros or the big hedge fund operators picking up these small banks for cheap.
[03:13:26.289 --> 03:13:26.929]  Absolutely.
[03:13:26.929 --> 03:13:29.790]  So that's why I brought this article up first.
[03:13:29.790 --> 03:13:47.494]  And I want you to spend some more time on this before we get into some other related issues because here they are in Businessweek in Bloomberg saying, and Obama's people are now out there pushing this, that, oh, we're going to just take your pension funds wholesale to protect them.
[03:13:48.174 --> 03:13:55.199]  And then, of course, they'll invest those in derivatives again, then they'll take a large portion of it down the road, get people more dependent on government.
[03:13:55.199 --> 03:14:00.543]  Well, we did take most of it, but, you know, you've got to stick with us or you won't get any of it.
[03:14:00.543 --> 03:14:02.945]  It's this scam artist trap.
[03:14:02.945 --> 03:14:03.905]  Here's the question.
[03:14:03.905 --> 03:14:11.491]  Should capital be allocated according to, one, the preferences of the people who are either responsible, own it, or control it?
[03:14:11.491 --> 03:14:16.494]  Two, according to economic performance, i.e., you know, what's the best investment?
[03:14:17.873 --> 03:14:25.204]  Should it be channeled according to government dictates to a few small investors that allow them to control and own everything?
[03:14:26.923 --> 03:14:28.303]  Well, let me stop you again.
[03:14:28.303 --> 03:14:28.864]  Exactly.
[03:14:28.864 --> 03:14:37.126]  It sounds good that in the banking bill, the government is now officially in the banking business.
[03:14:37.126 --> 03:14:49.691]  Slipped into it was a student loan legislation where the government will now be the person loaning, but really it'll be the government directing you to specific top three or four banks.
[03:14:49.691 --> 03:14:52.011]  So this is a vertical integration.
[03:14:52.011 --> 03:14:53.572]  And I want to be clear here for new listeners.
[03:14:54.440 --> 03:14:56.981]  The government controls the regulators.
[03:14:56.981 --> 03:15:03.602]  They can arrest or set up or shut down or sanction any pension fund manager that doesn't do what they're told.
[03:15:03.602 --> 03:15:16.845]  And here they are in Bloomberg, openly telling the federal government, run by private banks at the top, telling the pension fund controllers, you will invest with us, quote, in failed banks.
[03:15:16.845 --> 03:15:21.046]  So this is the government completely taking over society.
[03:15:21.046 --> 03:15:23.127]  Break down how serious this is.
[03:15:23.387 --> 03:15:24.968]  The Soviet Union.
[03:15:24.968 --> 03:15:26.628]  But here's what you've got.
[03:15:26.628 --> 03:15:30.130]  Let's say your neighbor, Alex, is an insider.
[03:15:30.130 --> 03:15:33.151]  And you are an outsider.
[03:15:33.151 --> 03:15:37.092]  And your insider neighborhood plays ball with the government.
[03:15:37.092 --> 03:15:39.193]  And the government says, you know something?
[03:15:39.193 --> 03:15:43.435]  You can finance your car for zero percent, which is what hedge fund operators have been doing.
[03:15:43.435 --> 03:15:44.635]  They've been on the carry trade.
[03:15:44.635 --> 03:15:46.436]  They've been borrowing for zero to one percent.
[03:15:47.616 --> 03:16:00.782]  And your neighbor can finance his car with 0% financing, he can finance his mortgage with 0% financing, and we're going to provide equity financing to his business for 2%.
[03:16:00.782 --> 03:16:13.207]  Meantime, you have to pay 5% for your car financing, 6% for your mortgage financing, and by the way, you can't get equity for your business, but you can borrow at the bank for 12% if you can get somebody to guarantee you.
[03:16:13.207 --> 03:16:16.369]  Okay, now, how long is it going to take before your neighbor has
[03:16:17.150 --> 03:16:23.793]  You know, a much bigger car, a much bigger house, and has bought your business, you know, that went bankrupt.
[03:16:23.793 --> 03:16:36.659]  And if you... And if you won't... We're talking about controlling it through the back door by controlling the cost of capital, and certain players get a very low or even free or negative cost of capital.
[03:16:36.659 --> 03:16:40.060]  So I'm a bank every time I lose... I'm a big bank every time I lose money.
[03:16:40.060 --> 03:16:42.301]  You just replenish what I lost.
[03:16:42.301 --> 03:16:46.523]  Whereas the rest of us have real risk, and we have to pay
[03:16:47.446 --> 03:16:54.032]  A much higher cost of capital than we would if we could just, you know, if there was a real market.
[03:16:54.032 --> 03:17:06.864]  And if you won't sell your business to them, they put in the green economy, which is run by government, they will selectively force you to sell your business, or they will shut you down.
[03:17:06.864 --> 03:17:12.289]  Well, there's thousands of ways it happens, but there's a double standard in terms of regulatory enforcement.
[03:17:12.850 --> 03:17:19.615]  So, for example, you know, I used to have a broker-dealer that was a small company, before I'd worked on Wall Street.
[03:17:19.615 --> 03:17:28.462]  And if you look at the enforcement costs and time that we spent as a small business, it was significantly greater.
[03:17:28.462 --> 03:17:30.503]  But there are double standards.
[03:17:30.503 --> 03:17:38.029]  Now, let me describe behind this what one of the legitimate problems is.
[03:17:38.029 --> 03:17:39.590]  We have a real problem
[03:17:40.370 --> 03:17:44.711]  In that, right now, the financial markets have two goals.
[03:17:44.711 --> 03:17:51.512]  You know, the goal you're taught in business school is the goal of the financial markets is to allocate capital to the most efficient players.
[03:17:51.512 --> 03:18:03.594]  And so, you know, some companies are efficient, and they make money, and so they attract you, you buy their stock, as opposed to the big bank that has a derivative method and goes bankrupt, right?
[03:18:03.594 --> 03:18:05.615]  So, one is the allocation of capital.
[03:18:05.615 --> 03:18:07.215]  The other, increasingly, Alex,
[03:18:07.876 --> 03:18:09.957]  Is geopolitical economic warfare.
[03:18:09.957 --> 03:18:18.103]  You know, we've gone from a planet where wars occur with bombs to where wars occur with derivative bombs.
[03:18:18.103 --> 03:18:28.250]  And you're literally seeing a geopolitical competition between the Chinese, the Russians, and populations around the globe for resources.
[03:18:28.962 --> 03:18:30.423]  Through the capital markets.
[03:18:30.423 --> 03:18:45.274]  And so the national security goals of manipulating the futures market at the price of oil or the price of gold have literally overtaken, you know, the goal of using the markets for whatever.
[03:18:45.274 --> 03:18:54.081]  And part of what you're seeing with all the goal of the capital control is literally, if you're the government, you can't afford for people to be making a free market
[03:18:54.804 --> 03:19:01.287]  You need the 20 mules to go in this direction, because that's what you need to manage the Chinese.
[03:19:01.287 --> 03:19:07.029]  And so you have this incredible desire for control, including for a legitimate reason.
[03:19:07.029 --> 03:19:08.469]  And let me tell you what the problem is.
[03:19:08.469 --> 03:19:20.514]  You and I have talked many times about the red button problem, which is everybody in America, right now, we are all the beneficiary of this geopolitical effort.
[03:19:20.514 --> 03:19:23.335]  So tomorrow, if the geopolitics stop,
[03:19:24.082 --> 03:19:33.911]  And America stopped playing to win at geopolitics, and we stopped being the global leader in money laundering, and we stopped, you know, stealing from people using derivatives.
[03:19:33.911 --> 03:19:40.957]  What would happen is everybody's government subsidy check would stop, and as of last month, Americans get more government checks.
[03:19:40.957 --> 03:19:44.621]  We get more money from the government than we spend on the government taxes.
[03:19:44.621 --> 03:19:45.962]  Yeah, I saw that in the New York Times.
[03:19:45.962 --> 03:19:46.422]  Stay there.
[03:19:46.422 --> 03:19:49.265]  And again, I've been interrupting a few times because
[03:19:50.768 --> 03:19:56.039]  It's so incredible to see them openly saying they're going to take over the pension funds.
[03:19:56.039 --> 03:19:59.687]  We're going to break down where this is going when we come back.
[03:19:59.687 --> 03:20:00.168]  Stay with us.

[03:23:53.200 --> 03:23:55.683]  I want you to listen very carefully to Kathryn Austin Fitch.
[03:23:55.683 --> 03:23:57.225]  I want her to go back over.
[03:24:10.595 --> 03:24:13.918]  The information she just laid on us and expand on it.
[03:24:13.918 --> 03:24:15.379]  They get you dependent on government.
[03:24:15.379 --> 03:24:19.502]  They take your pension funds, your investment, your tax money for the infrastructure.
[03:24:19.502 --> 03:24:22.084]  They put it in offshore banks and derivatives.
[03:24:22.084 --> 03:24:24.146]  That bankrupts people by design.
[03:24:24.146 --> 03:24:28.389]  Then they come back and say we need even more money and more taxes to prop all this up.
[03:24:28.389 --> 03:24:34.774]  When you hear it's for the geopolitical purposes of the US and England and Europe, that's the private banking arms.
[03:24:34.774 --> 03:24:36.556]  They're feeding on us, but they get us
[03:24:37.176 --> 03:24:37.496]  I think?
[03:25:01.121 --> 03:25:09.604]  Catherine Austen, this is a short segment, but please elaborate on the point that you were making.
[03:25:09.604 --> 03:25:12.365]  Oh, now Alex, you got me.
[03:25:12.365 --> 03:25:19.968]  I had just finished making the point about the red button, and the extent to which we are financially dependent
[03:25:20.837 --> 03:25:22.358]  On global warfare.
[03:25:22.358 --> 03:25:32.347]  So we're implementing warfare globally, whether with military warfare, with covert operations warfare, or increasingly now with financial warfare.
[03:25:32.347 --> 03:25:38.212]  And the reality as a system is most Americans are the financial beneficiary of this sort of
[03:25:38.832 --> 03:25:39.253]  We're good to go.
[03:25:54.992 --> 03:25:58.075]  Spiritually committed people to evolving our society spiritually.
[03:25:58.075 --> 03:26:05.543]  99% said they would not push the red button because they don't want their mutual funds to go down or the government checks to stop.
[03:26:05.543 --> 03:26:09.467]  So we now have an entire society which is financially complicit
[03:26:10.507 --> 03:26:19.430]  In this warfare model, and so the question for all of us is, you know, nobody wants the top guys to push the red button because they're afraid.
[03:26:19.430 --> 03:26:26.773]  And as long as we're afraid to push the red button or to engage in a conversation about, you know, okay, how do we turn it green?
[03:26:26.773 --> 03:26:28.454]  How do we make it financially attractive?
[03:26:29.034 --> 03:26:38.445]  Then what happens is we go along, and I can say it today, you know, that they are doing this, but the reality is, Alex, that we are supporting them.
[03:26:38.445 --> 03:26:46.113]  If you look at the implementation of all of the sort of police state things, those things are being supported at the local level.
[03:26:46.113 --> 03:26:48.476]  I mean, I've watched all these things get implemented.
[03:26:49.136 --> 03:26:55.640]  Time after time after time, and it's, you know, there's always a group of local people who are helping promote it.
[03:26:55.640 --> 03:26:56.560]  It's frightening.
[03:26:56.560 --> 03:26:59.302]  And so, you know, but they're doing it because it makes the money.
[03:27:02.148 --> 03:27:06.011]  But to boil it down, we're coming to the end.
[03:27:06.011 --> 03:27:29.969]  The banks know they've pumped up the Ponzi scheme to such a level that they're now preparing to rob whatever wealth we've got left, and you talked about how the elites for the last decade have been leaving the United States, and now... They're not coming to the end, because if you look at the wealth that this planet can create and harvest, the amount of wealth that's been created and can be harvested
[03:27:30.430 --> 03:27:33.302]  To date, it's tiny compared to what you could do in the next 20 or 30 years.
[03:27:34.531 --> 03:27:43.597]  So they've just, you know, this is far, we're on a journey and the wealth that can be created is far more than exists to date or have.
[03:27:43.597 --> 03:27:44.938]  Well, Catherine, you misunderstand.
[03:27:44.938 --> 03:27:45.298]  Hold on.
[03:27:45.298 --> 03:27:46.559]  You misunderstand what I'm saying.
[03:27:46.559 --> 03:27:46.920]  Okay.
[03:27:46.920 --> 03:28:00.569]  They are artificially cutting the avenues of wealth off to independent groups and smaller organizations and vertically integrating it and saying they want to cut wealth generation off to people in the West.
[03:28:00.569 --> 03:28:01.790]  I know they got us addicted.
[03:28:02.230 --> 03:28:02.510]  Right.
[03:28:02.510 --> 03:28:15.034]  In North America, their attitude is, listen, if y'all just sit up, sit down, shut up, you know, we put an implant on you and you live on $600 of government subsidy a month, it'll make it much easier for us to manage the planet.
[03:28:15.034 --> 03:28:18.035]  You've created a huge amount of wealth, we just stole it all.
[03:28:18.035 --> 03:28:25.217]  You gotta be real unhappy about that, so we just want you to sit in the corner and shut up, because, you know, we're on to the next thing.
[03:28:25.217 --> 03:28:26.817]  Bye.
[03:28:26.817 --> 03:28:28.158]  And what is the next thing?
[03:28:28.158 --> 03:28:29.018]  What is the next thing?
[03:28:29.619 --> 03:28:33.302]  Well, the next thing is they go to a global economy and a global government.
[03:28:33.302 --> 03:28:39.366]  In other words, the people managing this in the United States don't see themselves as Americans anymore.
[03:28:39.366 --> 03:28:42.088]  They see themselves as globalists.
[03:28:42.088 --> 03:28:50.434]  And they're managing to a global operation, and in fact, if you look at where their big investments are, their big investments are in space.
[03:28:50.434 --> 03:28:56.038]  So in fact, you know, they're not necessarily even looking at planet Earth as the 100% base of operations.
[03:28:59.468 --> 03:29:11.763]  But they have fantastic new technology, and they have a global framework, and their attitude is, we've moved on, you're left behind, and the question is how to manage the endgame.
[03:29:13.317 --> 03:29:13.978]  I agree.
[03:29:13.978 --> 03:29:19.321]  Now, when we come back with Catherine Austin Fitz, I want you to elaborate on what their endgame is.
[03:29:19.321 --> 03:29:23.144]  And we were talking during the last break, you were saying there are ways to stop this.
[03:29:23.144 --> 03:29:25.685]  We want to get your perspective on that.
[03:29:25.685 --> 03:29:29.448]  Catherine Austin Fitz is our guest.
[03:29:29.448 --> 03:29:33.270]  We really appreciate her being on the radio broadcast with us today.
[03:29:33.270 --> 03:29:38.034]  We'll give you her website as well when we come back after this quick break.
[03:29:38.034 --> 03:29:40.916]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:41.971 --> 03:29:44.093]  We're talking about reality here.
[03:29:44.093 --> 03:29:45.274]  Not the baseball game.
[03:29:45.274 --> 03:29:46.515]  Not the latest cosmetics.
[03:29:46.515 --> 03:29:48.277]  Not acting cool to your neighbors.
[03:29:48.277 --> 03:29:49.598]  But life and death.
[03:29:49.598 --> 03:29:51.821]  Freedom and slavery.
[03:29:51.821 --> 03:29:53.222]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.222 --> 03:29:55.744]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.744 --> 03:29:58.427]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.667 --> 03:30:08.309]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[03:30:08.309 --> 03:30:13.431]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[03:30:13.431 --> 03:30:22.175]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[03:30:22.175 --> 03:30:26.236]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[03:30:26.236 --> 03:30:28.537]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[03:30:30.543 --> 03:30:35.265]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[03:30:35.265 --> 03:30:39.087]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[03:30:39.087 --> 03:30:40.327]  Others don't.
[03:30:40.327 --> 03:30:42.468]  We turn jeans inside out.
[03:30:42.468 --> 03:30:44.249]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[03:30:44.249 --> 03:30:47.150]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[03:30:47.150 --> 03:30:53.773]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[03:30:53.773 --> 03:30:56.474]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[03:30:56.474 --> 03:30:58.835]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[03:30:58.835 --> 03:30:59.716]  Others don't.
[03:31:01.892 --> 03:31:04.235]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:31:04.235 --> 03:31:06.598]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:31:06.598 --> 03:31:09.823]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:31:09.823 --> 03:31:14.929]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:31:14.929 --> 03:31:19.115]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:31:19.415 --> 03:31:21.877]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:31:21.877 --> 03:31:24.319]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:31:24.319 --> 03:31:27.581]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:31:27.581 --> 03:31:35.167]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:31:35.507 --> 03:31:40.892]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:31:40.892 --> 03:31:43.214]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:31:43.214 --> 03:31:47.438]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:31:47.438 --> 03:31:48.519]  And I got news for you.
[03:31:48.519 --> 03:31:49.860]  You're everyone else.
[03:31:49.860 --> 03:31:51.361]  Invisible Empire.

[03:32:01.115 --> 03:32:01.916]  Hi, everyone.
[03:32:01.916 --> 03:32:02.977]  Andy Anderson here.

[03:32:07.381 --> 03:32:13.186]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[03:32:13.186 --> 03:32:17.530]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness?
[03:32:17.530 --> 03:32:19.212]  No more protection till you use it again.
[03:32:19.372 --> 03:32:20.712]  PureWorks to the rescue!

[03:32:58.540 --> 03:32:58.980]  This is the end
[03:33:09.298 --> 03:33:11.779]  Catherine Austin Fitz is our guest.
[03:33:11.779 --> 03:33:14.580]  We're talking about the most important subject there is.
[03:33:14.580 --> 03:33:23.123]  The global government, the elite, their mindset, how they control the planet, where they're going.
[03:33:23.123 --> 03:33:29.125]  Again, Catherine Austin Fitz is a former Assistant Secretary of Housing, Federal Housing Commissioner under Bush 1.
[03:33:29.125 --> 03:33:34.367]  The website is solari.com.
[03:33:34.367 --> 03:33:35.508]  Excellent info up there.
[03:33:37.290 --> 03:33:51.225]  Okay, I'm gonna try to just sit back and give you the floor because I want you to give people the overview of who we're dealing with, what their endgame is, what the next phase of their operations is going to be, and how we stop them, how we get out of this trap of being dependent on them.
[03:33:51.225 --> 03:33:58.033]  You notice all they ever want to do is get us more dependent so that there's basically no way to get away from these people.
[03:33:58.033 --> 03:33:58.233]  Right.
[03:33:59.346 --> 03:34:05.707]  Well, you know, it's a big series of about a thousand questions, but let me just start.
[03:34:05.707 --> 03:34:11.888]  Because I think I used to have a pastor in Washington who used to say, if we can fix it, God can fix it.
[03:34:11.888 --> 03:34:21.590]  And a lot of the solutions accelerate, Alex, the day that everyone sits back and says, you know, these guys are as nuts as Alex Jones says they are.
[03:34:21.590 --> 03:34:26.251]  Because all this stuff about slavery and police state, you know, those are reasonable words.
[03:34:26.829 --> 03:34:28.250]  That is where they're going.
[03:34:28.250 --> 03:34:40.718]  And, you know, I say this as a former regulator, a former Assistant Secretary of Housing, a former board member of a Wall Street firm, a former board member of Sallie Mae, the student loan finance organization.
[03:34:40.718 --> 03:34:44.980]  And let me tell you how I came to that conclusion.
[03:34:44.980 --> 03:34:54.006]  Part of my background is doing portfolio strategy for big... You know, I was the FHA Commissioner, so doing portfolio strategy for $300 billion of liabilities.
[03:34:55.808 --> 03:35:06.397]  And then my company in Washington, the Hamilton Securities Group, built databases of all, you know, sort of community assets and real estate, which is looking at the entire GNP.
[03:35:07.327 --> 03:35:14.131]  And then when we compared it to certain things in the securities and global markets, you're talking about the GNP of the planet.
[03:35:14.131 --> 03:35:18.974]  So I'm used to dealing in very large numbers and actuarial analysis.
[03:35:18.974 --> 03:35:25.777]  So, you know, and actuarially analysis says, well, if you stop feeding people GMO food, they're going to live longer.
[03:35:25.777 --> 03:35:30.240]  That means insurance companies are going to have to pay out this much more, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:35:31.007 --> 03:35:39.071]  So you're used to dealing in very big numbers and the butterfly effect of changes in policy with changes in lifespan.
[03:35:39.071 --> 03:35:41.132]  So I give that as a background.
[03:35:41.132 --> 03:35:43.313]  And I wrote this in the article I wrote.
[03:35:43.313 --> 03:35:48.976]  I wrote an essay about why I was opposed to the swine flu vaccination.
[03:35:48.976 --> 03:35:55.499]  And I literally, when I saw the policies that were being implemented in connection with the rollout of the WTO,
[03:35:56.340 --> 03:36:06.985]  And the control of agribusiness worldwide, the rounding up of innocent people in American communities and stuffed into prison and the private prison property.
[03:36:06.985 --> 03:36:23.753]  I went through all the different trends from 96 to 98, and I came to the conclusion, sort of back of the envelope, that the only thing I could conclude was that the leadership as a policy was planning on very significant depopulation worldwide.
[03:36:24.318 --> 03:36:41.084]  That was the only way I could explain, you know, the 20 policies I was seeing being implemented both here and globally with the WTO, particularly the control of the food supply and system with sort of what Monsanto is doing in genetically modified food.
[03:36:41.084 --> 03:36:46.606]  And I was very quiet about it at the time, you know, because I knew other people couldn't fathom what I was saying.
[03:36:46.606 --> 03:36:48.227]  And I remember in 1998 or 99,
[03:36:51.474 --> 03:36:58.756]  A very, very savvy portfolio strategist from the financial community called me up and said, can you have lunch with me?
[03:36:58.756 --> 03:37:00.036]  I'm going to be in Washington.
[03:37:00.036 --> 03:37:16.381]  And we went to lunch at Union Station, and he looked at me and he said, you know, he said, I know this is going to sound crazy, but I've done the analysis, and if you look at the changes in policies that are being rolled out over the last four years, the only thing I can conclude is they're planning on significant depopulation.
[03:37:16.381 --> 03:37:18.981]  And I said, well, that's what my analysis shows.
[03:37:18.981 --> 03:37:20.742]  And we just kind of stared at each other.
[03:37:21.619 --> 03:37:38.892]  And if you look across the board at what is being done in terms of building databases on American citizens, what is being done with RFID, is it RFID or RFDI?
[03:37:38.892 --> 03:37:41.954]  Well, they've got a bunch of different ones, but let me just stop you for a moment.
[03:37:41.954 --> 03:37:42.775]  Okay.
[03:37:42.775 --> 03:37:49.160]  Because you did, as this huge actuary analyst running hundreds of millions of dollars, you saw it
[03:37:51.178 --> 03:37:59.684]  Like if somebody sees a guy pull up in a van and start casing a house and then checking the front door you think maybe they're about to try to rob us.
[03:37:59.684 --> 03:38:07.390]  I have been at the guy's house as a fly on the wall and heard him talk about how he's going to rob and so separately
[03:38:07.990 --> 03:38:09.471]  And of course you know all this now.
[03:38:09.471 --> 03:38:24.703]  It turns out for 50 years they've been planning this and building a world government as a means to an end and all of the tracking, all of the surveillance, all the police state, all the mind control, the conditioning is to be rolled out in phases and we're now coming into the endgame.
[03:38:25.463 --> 03:38:30.265]  To literally kill 80% of people, how do we stop this?
[03:38:30.265 --> 03:38:40.888]  And again, in the phases, they shut the resources off, so then you become dependent on government, so it has you in its kill grid, the drugging, the cancer viruses, and the shots, the mercury.
[03:38:40.888 --> 03:38:42.269]  I mean, it's all happening.
[03:38:42.269 --> 03:38:43.329]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:38:43.329 --> 03:38:47.250]  Well, the food is poisoning us, the vaccines are poisoning us, on and on and on.
[03:38:47.250 --> 03:38:49.611]  Here's the thing to understand.
[03:38:49.611 --> 03:38:52.152]  Theoretically, there is a way to stop them.
[03:38:52.816 --> 03:38:59.922]  There really is a way to stop them because, and it's what the poet said, we are many, they are few.
[03:38:59.922 --> 03:39:06.948]  And the reality is, when will you get a critical mass of people facing what's really going on?
[03:39:06.948 --> 03:39:10.131]  And then when you hit that tipping point, what can they do?
[03:39:10.131 --> 03:39:17.077]  Now, step one is, you know, the key thing to understand, what everybody has to do, is we have to do what gives us energy.
[03:39:18.498 --> 03:39:21.919]  You know, what we all can't do is get in a bus and go to Washington today.
[03:39:21.919 --> 03:39:27.401]  You know, there are many ideas of what we can do that waste a huge amount of our time and effort that we don't have.
[03:39:27.401 --> 03:39:39.066]  But step number one that you can do, and it's one that will give you a lot of energy, if you sequence it right, is get as far away from them as you possibly can, or the people who implement their wishes in your industry.
[03:39:39.066 --> 03:39:41.727]  So, get out of the big cities, I say number one.
[03:39:42.347 --> 03:39:43.288]  Get to know your neighbors.
[03:39:43.288 --> 03:39:44.849]  Stop watching as much television.
[03:39:44.849 --> 03:39:45.470]  Get healthy.
[03:39:45.470 --> 03:39:46.671]  Purify your water.
[03:39:46.671 --> 03:39:49.534]  But more importantly, recognize them as the enemy.
[03:39:49.534 --> 03:39:51.455]  Don't just believe Catherine Austin Fitz.
[03:39:51.455 --> 03:39:53.057]  Don't just believe Alex Jones.
[03:39:53.057 --> 03:40:02.845]  Find out we're telling you the truth and this is life and death and then the ball game isn't going to matter so much and take all your energies and stop seeing Catherine Austin Fitz as your champion.
[03:40:02.845 --> 03:40:04.867]  Stop seeing Alex Jones as your champion.
[03:40:04.867 --> 03:40:07.410]  You know, she's not Joan of Arc and I'm not George Washington.
[03:40:08.647 --> 03:40:18.671]  You know, it's really funny, and when you withdraw, all your ideas are great, but you want to get it financially not dependent on them as possible.
[03:40:18.671 --> 03:40:23.333]  So get as far away as you can from government money or money that they control.
[03:40:23.333 --> 03:40:31.416]  One of the things that is just a profoundly important thing is everybody tomorrow in the country, Alex said, you know,
[03:40:32.049 --> 03:40:38.782]  Any bank that's trading derivatives or any of the big banks that got bailout money, I'm getting as far away from them as I can.
[03:40:39.608 --> 03:40:50.371]  So, if you pulled your money out of the big banks and went to a well-managed local bank tomorrow, it would have a profound and traumatic impact.
[03:40:50.371 --> 03:40:54.192]  Now, you can say, well, all those banks channel money into Wall Street anyway.
[03:40:54.192 --> 03:41:01.214]  If I'm the Federal Reserve and I have to negotiate with 25,000 bank presidents as opposed to 10, it's a very different picture.
[03:41:01.214 --> 03:41:03.075]  It's a very different world.
[03:41:03.075 --> 03:41:03.295]  Okay?
[03:41:03.826 --> 03:41:22.872]  So anything you can do, it's real funny, I have a member of my network whose Jewish family was really hurt in the Holocaust, and he was asking me whether or not he should bank at a big bank, and I said, you know, you're basically asking me whether you should put your money with him or money management or not.
[03:41:23.638 --> 03:41:25.498]  Now, why are you asking me that question?
[03:41:25.498 --> 03:41:27.919]  Don't you know better?
[03:41:27.919 --> 03:41:28.939]  But that's what we're doing.
[03:41:28.939 --> 03:41:38.222]  We're financing... If you look at any activist group who's opposed to any of the things they say they... Let's say the guys are opposed to GMO.
[03:41:38.222 --> 03:41:44.763]  Well, if you look at where their money is, they're all financing the creation of GMOs and the building of that infrastructure.
[03:41:44.763 --> 03:41:45.843]  When you finance the U.S.
[03:41:45.843 --> 03:41:48.224]  government, you're financing genetically modified seed.
[03:41:49.093 --> 03:41:49.614]  Absolutely.
[03:41:49.614 --> 03:41:49.714]  Now,
[03:42:08.539 --> 03:42:10.960]  Other solutions.
[03:42:10.960 --> 03:42:13.661]  I mean, I jumped in there when you said get as far away as you can from their money.
[03:42:13.661 --> 03:42:15.361]  Okay, here's the next solution.
[03:42:15.361 --> 03:42:21.083]  Who are you supporting for sheriff in this local election?
[03:42:21.083 --> 03:42:31.706]  Okay, if 3,100 counties, the sheriff, there's dual sovereignty under the Constitution, so your sheriff can literally tell the federal government
[03:42:32.352 --> 03:42:39.955]  To get off, you know, your county property and know they may not enforce something that is outside the 10th Amendment.
[03:42:39.955 --> 03:42:48.478]  Okay, so we're coming into election, the election cycle, and the election cycle is always a time, Alex, when you can be talking to your neighbors about all these issues.
[03:42:48.478 --> 03:42:57.382]  And let me tell you something, the fact that the bailouts and healthcare passed without having any kind of popular, sufficient popular support for a change of that
[03:42:58.186 --> 03:42:59.307]  Extraordinary nature.
[03:42:59.307 --> 03:43:02.668]  It's got people worked up and they're ready to have a conversation.
[03:43:02.668 --> 03:43:08.631]  So, number one, you want to get into office the right kind of sheriff, and you want your sheriff.
[03:43:08.631 --> 03:43:18.335]  Is your sheriff out there doing crime patrol, or is your sheriff instead spending all of your tax money foreclosing on people on behalf of the big bank?
[03:43:18.335 --> 03:43:20.376]  And trying to squeeze people and raise revenue.
[03:43:20.376 --> 03:43:24.518]  We've always promoted patriot sheriffs, so we're on the same page on that front.
[03:43:24.518 --> 03:43:27.459]  The second thing is, in your state and local areas,
[03:43:28.058 --> 03:43:32.560]  You have candidates who are proposing 10th Amendment legislation.
[03:43:32.560 --> 03:43:35.881]  So, for example, Idaho passed the Health Freedom Act.
[03:43:35.881 --> 03:43:39.662]  We have lots of states trying to pass the Health Freedom Act.
[03:43:39.662 --> 03:43:45.244]  We have lots of states, you know, doing a variety of things on the 10th Amendment.
[03:43:45.244 --> 03:43:48.105]  There's a great 10th Amendment center online.
[03:43:48.105 --> 03:43:55.187]  So you want to find out where are the state and local representatives who are active on 10th Amendment, and you want to get hooked up in supporting them.
[03:43:56.414 --> 03:43:57.054]  Okay.
[03:43:57.054 --> 03:43:59.336]  But the number one message here is get up!
[03:43:59.336 --> 03:44:01.638]  Don't just count on other people to do it.
[03:44:01.638 --> 03:44:03.199]  Now, I want to get into some other issues.
[03:44:03.199 --> 03:44:08.142]  I'm going to talk about some more solutions here, but I also want to talk about what their endgame is.
[03:44:08.142 --> 03:44:11.705]  Studying these larger... Okay, so can I mention one other thing?
[03:44:11.705 --> 03:44:12.065]  Go ahead.
[03:44:12.065 --> 03:44:14.046]  Stop giving them your data.
[03:44:16.097 --> 03:44:17.137]  There's Edwin Black.
[03:44:17.137 --> 03:44:18.558]  Have you ever had Edwin Black on?
[03:44:18.558 --> 03:44:19.519]  Yes.
[03:44:19.519 --> 03:44:24.603]  Edwin Black wrote the book about IBM building the database and computer systems for the Holocaust?
[03:44:24.603 --> 03:44:25.163]  Yes.
[03:44:25.163 --> 03:44:25.864]  Okay.
[03:44:25.864 --> 03:44:38.193]  Well, any kind of police state or any kind of slavery depends seriously on having the infrastructure you need, the database and computer infrastructure you need,
[03:44:38.717 --> 03:44:38.897]  I think?
[03:44:58.499 --> 03:45:17.206]  The definitive database infrastructure that will allow them to define where you live, who you live with, connect up your healthcare databases, connect up your tax information if they want to, connect up all sorts of private commercial information they have about your spending habits.
[03:45:17.768 --> 03:45:19.709]  Well that's what this bill does.
[03:45:19.709 --> 03:45:21.790]  It says the IRS looks at the health care you're getting.
[03:45:21.790 --> 03:45:26.992]  You can take money out of your savings account, medical savings account.
[03:45:26.992 --> 03:45:32.194]  You were talking about how they're putting in new laws to track all your money or not let you get your money out of the country.
[03:45:32.194 --> 03:45:34.055]  The elites already pulled their money out.
[03:45:34.055 --> 03:45:38.016]  Now they want to make sure the middle class has to stay here and basically be sucked dry.
[03:45:38.016 --> 03:45:38.637]  Right.
[03:45:38.637 --> 03:45:42.738]  So what you want to do, the first thing you want to do is you want to get your data out of the system.
[03:45:42.738 --> 03:45:43.839]  Stop giving them data.
[03:45:44.542 --> 03:45:47.924]  Okay, and there are lots of different ways you can do that.
[03:45:47.924 --> 03:45:53.566]  And then the second thing you want to do is you want to get out of the money system as much as possible anyway.
[03:45:53.566 --> 03:45:59.288]  So anything you can do to protect, to not make yourself a target, you know, we can
[03:46:00.976 --> 03:46:05.619]  Put our money in the stock, get a dividend, and then go buy water from the water company.
[03:46:05.619 --> 03:46:11.103]  But also, if we live in a rural area, we can just stop being in the middle, and we can go out and build a well.
[03:46:11.103 --> 03:46:14.765]  And then I don't need your stock, and I don't need your dividend, and I don't need your water bill.
[03:46:14.765 --> 03:46:18.688]  And that's why they're moving nationwide and worldwide to block people drilling their own wells.
[03:46:18.688 --> 03:46:19.849]  Well, that's why.
[03:46:19.849 --> 03:46:24.692]  If you can, you want to live in an area where you still have the power to do that.
[03:46:24.692 --> 03:46:28.715]  Okay, we're running out of time, and it's clear I've got to have you back up for a full hour just on solutions.
[03:46:30.048 --> 03:46:31.309]  Those are all great solutions.
[03:46:31.309 --> 03:46:33.511]  I, number one, say wake people up.
[03:46:33.511 --> 03:46:36.694]  They're ready to be woken up to the full horror.
[03:46:36.694 --> 03:46:49.744]  But looking at their program and being able to factor in all these different elements on a wide spectrum analysis, what do you see as their game plan in the next six months to a year to two years, out to five years?
[03:46:49.744 --> 03:46:53.046]  How do you see them unrolling this global financial takeover?
[03:46:53.046 --> 03:46:56.068]  And then we'll dovetail that with this war-making economy.
[03:46:56.829 --> 03:46:58.870]  That isn't just launching wars overseas.
[03:46:58.870 --> 03:47:10.557]  Naked body scanners, surveillance, face scanners, CPS, DynCorp out grabbing more children for no reason, the Texas case where they're taking people's kids now if their parents say don't trust the government.
[03:47:10.557 --> 03:47:12.038]  I mean, it's getting crazy.
[03:47:12.038 --> 03:47:12.258]  Right.
[03:47:12.258 --> 03:47:18.082]  No, it's well, it's been crazy for a long time, but it's going to become very crazy to most people.
[03:47:18.082 --> 03:47:26.347]  And I think what you need to do is first and foremost, you need to know that that if you are awake and out to protect yourself,
[03:47:27.065 --> 03:47:28.246]  They can't do this.
[03:47:28.246 --> 03:47:38.537]  And so the question is what... Step number one everybody has to do is turn off their TV and stop listening to their media and stay linked into media that's telling you the truth.
[03:47:38.537 --> 03:47:39.938]  That's step number one.
[03:47:39.938 --> 03:47:43.722]  Because the first way they control you, Alex, is with your mind.
[03:47:43.722 --> 03:47:45.864]  So the first step is get your mind clean.
[03:47:45.864 --> 03:47:47.186]  Don't let them control your mind.
[03:47:48.677 --> 03:47:58.509]  Well, I mean, how can a cop take a family's child and put on the CPS form they taught their children not to trust the government?
[03:47:58.509 --> 03:48:02.894]  I mean, that's right out of 1984, and these cops feel good while they're doing this.
[03:48:02.894 --> 03:48:04.516]  I mean, these are tyrants.
[03:48:04.516 --> 03:48:04.957]  You know why?
[03:48:04.957 --> 03:48:08.161]  Because I've seen this in my own situation when I was targeted.
[03:48:08.861 --> 03:48:13.823]  Every team, we had 18 audits and investigations at the Hamilton Securities Group.
[03:48:13.823 --> 03:48:20.625]  And when each one started, the people coming in to audit and investigate thought we were, you know, just bad, horrible people.
[03:48:20.625 --> 03:48:26.248]  And then we'd work with them, and before it was over, they'd be on our side again.
[03:48:26.248 --> 03:48:32.530]  But initially, they are taught to believe that you're bad people, and the problem is most people get defensive.
[03:48:33.368 --> 03:48:34.449]  And don't work through it.
[03:48:34.449 --> 03:48:40.914]  We were trained in spiritual warfare, so we saw it as our job to bring them across to the light, and usually did.
[03:48:40.914 --> 03:48:48.959]  And so, um, you know, they really don't know, and it's hard, Alex, for you to fathom that the system is that ugly or that evil.
[03:48:48.959 --> 03:48:51.962]  They really don't know, many of them.
[03:48:51.962 --> 03:48:53.583]  So we gotta, we gotta turn them around.
[03:48:54.281 --> 03:49:03.774]  When you saw our article last Friday, cops and CPS seize child from parents for mistrusting government, I was aware of this, but you sent me a lot of stuff that I actually wasn't aware of.
[03:49:03.774 --> 03:49:10.764]  We're going to be showing people some document cam shots right now with DynCorp heavily involved
[03:49:11.765 --> 03:49:16.047]  Globally, it's been congressional hearings in white slavery, child kidnapping rings.
[03:49:16.047 --> 03:49:24.410]  They now have a new name, but CSC, DynCorp, and the economics... Well, they merged into CSC and then they got spun off and went public, so they're back to their old name.
[03:49:25.478 --> 03:49:35.849]  Okay, so, but I mean, I have all the mainstream news articles, this is literally a legion of doom, and that's all part of their military operation, and grabbing kids is very lucrative.
[03:49:35.849 --> 03:49:42.336]  Well, the scariest story in the world, and one that's hard for most people to get into, is the role of pedophilia.
[03:49:42.336 --> 03:49:46.521]  And pedophilia is a very old story, Alex, it's been used for years.
[03:49:47.287 --> 03:49:53.589]  You know, as both a personnel benefit, if you will, and a form of entrapment.
[03:49:53.589 --> 03:50:00.832]  Once you get a file, you know, once you get dirty pictures of somebody engaged in pedophilia, a politician or business leader, you own them for life.
[03:50:00.832 --> 03:50:05.253]  It's one of the most economic ways to control their... I hate to say it, but that's the reality.
[03:50:05.253 --> 03:50:13.616]  If you look at the history of narcotics trafficking and mortgage fraud in this country, it's intimately linked with pedophilia and sex slavery.
[03:50:13.616 --> 03:50:15.497]  You know, I just hate to say it, but that's the way it is.
[03:50:16.255 --> 03:50:21.400]  And I got on to DynCorp in the 90s because you had a couple of whistleblowers.
[03:50:21.400 --> 03:50:36.475]  When DynCorp was a government contract, you had their project managers literally engaged in owning, you know, buying and owning children and using them for sex and working with the local mafias who were tracking it, and yet the State Department
[03:50:37.106 --> 03:50:37.606]  Stay there.
[03:50:37.606 --> 03:50:38.627]  Stay there, Catherine.
[03:50:38.627 --> 03:50:45.991]  I'm going to have to have you back for a full hour soon on this subject because I actually got death threats when I first started covering this about eight years ago when we learned about DynCorp.
[03:50:45.991 --> 03:50:48.032]  Just modern slave traffickers.
[03:51:01.877 --> 03:51:05.418]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[03:51:05.418 --> 03:51:07.699]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[03:51:07.699 --> 03:51:08.559]  Don't!
[03:51:08.559 --> 03:51:12.000]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[03:51:12.000 --> 03:51:19.121]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[03:51:19.101 --> 03:51:21.082]  's number one debt secret.
[03:51:21.082 --> 03:51:24.763]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[03:51:25.143 --> 03:51:28.307]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[03:51:28.307 --> 03:51:35.695]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[03:51:35.695 --> 03:51:36.856]  Herb K was right.
[03:51:36.856 --> 03:51:39.900]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[03:51:40.080 --> 03:51:41.501]  What have you got to lose?
[03:51:41.501 --> 03:51:42.762]  Stop the calls now!
[03:51:42.762 --> 03:51:44.784]  Get out of debt and have more money!

[03:52:05.743 --> 03:52:07.024]  Tyranny is here.
[03:52:07.024 --> 03:52:10.767]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:52:10.767 --> 03:52:13.189]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:52:13.189 --> 03:52:18.354]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:52:19.034 --> 03:52:25.716]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:52:25.716 --> 03:52:31.697]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:52:31.697 --> 03:52:35.858]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[03:52:35.858 --> 03:52:40.159]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:52:40.159 --> 03:52:42.940]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies,
[03:52:43.380 --> 03:52:46.104]  Stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:52:46.104 --> 03:52:49.649]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:52:49.649 --> 03:52:51.632]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:52:51.632 --> 03:52:52.753]  It's here.

[03:54:10.263 --> 03:54:16.046]  On the 21st of April, later this month, Katherine Austen Fitz will spend at least an hour with us.
[03:54:16.046 --> 03:54:18.387]  She's very, very gracious.
[03:54:18.387 --> 03:54:20.788]  We'll give you her website before she leaves us.
[03:54:20.788 --> 03:54:22.629]  But for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers,
[03:54:24.784 --> 03:54:27.305]  I was just showing mainstream news articles.
[03:54:27.305 --> 03:54:32.868]  I have congressional hearings where DynCorp, they say, well, you kidnapped tens of thousands of children for sex slaves.
[03:54:32.868 --> 03:54:35.530]  And then they asked Rumsfeld, why are they allowed to do this?
[03:54:35.530 --> 03:54:36.750]  And he just said, they just are.
[03:54:36.750 --> 03:54:41.593]  And again, the magnitude of the evil and DynCorp.
[03:54:42.313 --> 03:54:50.935]  I'd known some of this, but she sent me a link to news articles and government purchase orders where they're involved all over warehousing the kids once they're taken.
[03:54:50.935 --> 03:54:54.957]  So now, it's not enough to grab Iraqi kids or Serb kids, now they're grabbing our kids.
[03:54:54.957 --> 03:54:56.837]  Catherine, finish your story.
[03:54:56.837 --> 03:55:07.400]  Okay, so the way I got onto this was I was in Washington and I had come on to DynCorp because of their role in the war on drugs.
[03:55:08.314 --> 03:55:10.995]  And I'll tell you two stories.
[03:55:10.995 --> 03:55:25.042]  The first was a group of peasant women from South America came up to give a presentation to congressmen, and they gave a presentation in Washington on how they were being moved off their land.
[03:55:25.042 --> 03:55:29.204]  Private people were picking up their land for cheap, and then the government was building housing.
[03:55:30.083 --> 03:55:39.509]  You know, this whole war on drugs game, and so I kept asking them questions, and finally they got very suspicious, and said, how come you know so much about how the money works in our country?
[03:55:39.509 --> 03:55:47.154]  And I said, well, I was the Assistant Secretary of Housing, and apparently it works the same way in your country as it works at ours.
[03:55:47.154 --> 03:55:58.641]  So afterwards, I did a little research and discovered the same contractor in enforcement at HUD in this country was the lead contractor in Latin America in the war on drugs.
[03:55:58.641 --> 03:55:59.382]  It was DynCorp.
[03:56:00.069 --> 03:56:09.524]  So I started to get in and look at Dinecore and on and on and on and that's when the story of the sex slave trafficking came out and it was unbelievable because
[03:56:10.160 --> 03:56:17.864]  Insight Magazine, Alex, wrote a great story about sex slave trafficking, the allegations in connection with the DynCorp litigation.
[03:56:17.864 --> 03:56:26.248]  Those magazines' cover story were dropped on every senator and every congressman's desk.
[03:56:26.248 --> 03:56:30.851]  And the next week, both the Navy and the State Department gave huge new contracts to DynCorp.
[03:56:31.471 --> 03:56:33.492]  It didn't seem to matter.
[03:56:33.492 --> 03:56:34.912]  It was quite amazing.
[03:56:34.912 --> 03:56:53.519]  Anyway, so fast forward, I ended up writing a series of stories about DynCorp and illuminating what was going on because, in fact, the chairman of the Finance Committee at Enron was a private investor who was the chairman, a lead investor, for many years in DynCorp.
[03:56:53.519 --> 03:56:58.381]  And the linkages between DynCorp and some of what was going on with the funny money was pretty scary.
[03:56:59.275 --> 03:57:13.326]  So, um, when our litigation was very hot and heavy, I, and of course Steinkor was a big contractor at the Department of Justice and was said by the Inslaw People to be one of the managers of the PROMIS software.
[03:57:13.326 --> 03:57:24.974]  Anyway, so we're in the middle of a litigation and I have a person, one of the people working for me, helping me do the litigation support work, which was very time-consuming, came to me and said, you know, um,
[03:57:26.734 --> 03:57:34.981]  Somebody from Child Protective Services showed up at my house, and she's a single mom.
[03:57:34.981 --> 03:57:36.943]  We've got a minute and a half left, so finish up on this.
[03:57:36.943 --> 03:57:40.325]  And so she said, I'm sure it's a mistake, and I said, no, no, no, no, this is dangerous.
[03:57:40.325 --> 03:57:41.787]  We need to research.
[03:57:41.787 --> 03:57:47.371]  Find out if DynCorp is the contractor for Child Protective Services.
[03:57:47.371 --> 03:57:51.655]  Sure enough, they were, and we literally had to get her to move to another state.
[03:57:51.655 --> 03:57:53.777]  And this is a child molestation army.
[03:57:54.770 --> 03:58:12.474]  Well, but what you need to, so last week when I saw what was going on in Texas, I said, you want to check and see whether DynCorp is behind, you know, is in the mix, because the idea of going after people's children just because they disagree with government policy, this is a real risk.
[03:58:12.474 --> 03:58:13.175]  This is Pierre Abel.
[03:58:13.175 --> 03:58:14.535]  Do you have one more point you wanted to make?
[03:58:15.083 --> 03:58:17.305]  Yes, I just wanted to thank you, Alex.
[03:58:17.305 --> 03:58:22.109]  You sent two of your incredible producers down to my house.
[03:58:22.109 --> 03:58:25.412]  During a snowstorm, they came all the way out from Memphis in a snowstorm.
[03:58:25.412 --> 03:58:26.893]  I never thought they'd make it.
[03:58:26.893 --> 03:58:28.155]  We spent a day filming.
[03:58:28.155 --> 03:58:29.496]  They were so intelligent.
[03:58:29.496 --> 03:58:30.637]  They were so professional.
[03:58:30.637 --> 03:58:32.238]  They were so capable.
[03:58:32.238 --> 03:58:36.662]  I said, wow, you know, Alex Jones is going to a whole new level.
[03:58:36.662 --> 03:58:37.463]  What a team.
[03:58:37.463 --> 03:58:38.263]  I was very impressed.
[03:58:38.263 --> 03:58:39.204]  You're a sweetheart.
[03:58:39.204 --> 03:58:40.365]  Catherine Austin Fitz.
[03:58:40.365 --> 03:58:40.966]  God bless you.
