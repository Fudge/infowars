[00:00.000 --> 00:14.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.040 --> 00:42.160]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones hello ladies and gentlemen thank
[00:42.160 --> 00:47.440]  you so much for joining us as we track the criminal activities of the global elite also
[00:47.440 --> 00:53.400]  known as the new world order crime syndicate we're going to be here live the next four hours
[00:53.400 --> 01:00.360]  I'll tell you about some of the guests that are coming up after the first segment is over
[01:00.360 --> 01:10.440]  when we go into the second segment but I wanted to calmly go over the facts of what we're
[01:10.440 --> 01:21.760]  looking at right now what we're facing the different nuances the biggest issue is we
[01:21.760 --> 01:29.160]  have criminal fear mongering going on by the president by Paulson by the republicans by
[01:29.160 --> 01:36.200]  the democrats I monitored some of the brainwashing television transmissions and I mean brainwashing
[01:36.200 --> 01:43.160]  in every respect this morning and they were using every trick of semantical manipulation
[01:43.160 --> 01:50.800]  every trick of their body language I'm going to be talking about that as well but John
[01:50.800 --> 01:56.480]  McCain just about 45 minutes ago gave a three minute statement we're going to be playing
[01:56.480 --> 02:03.440]  a little bit later and he basically said that the whole economy is going to go bankrupt
[02:03.440 --> 02:11.480]  main street is going to go bankrupt that the economy is going to come to a standstill that
[02:11.480 --> 02:17.560]  no one will get home loans or student loans or business loans and that you won't be able
[02:17.560 --> 02:23.360]  to get sonic hamburgers he was actually talking about how vital the service industry is by
[02:23.360 --> 02:28.920]  the way that's a listed by the federal government as manufacturing we have a lot of manufacturing
[02:28.920 --> 02:34.400]  goes on in this country still just manufacturing is now putting a hot dog and a hot dog bun
[02:34.400 --> 02:38.920]  or putting lettuce and cheese and tomatoes and onions and ketchup on a hamburger that's
[02:38.920 --> 02:47.320]  that's the Japanese make cameras and Honda cars and optics for our satellites and we
[02:47.320 --> 02:56.440]  make hamburgers and act tough that's mainly what we do so we'll be going over the incredible
[02:56.440 --> 03:02.600]  fair mongering now now they had really dumbed it down just there will be a depression if
[03:02.600 --> 03:12.280]  you don't give secretary of treasury Paulson immunity secrecy nothing can be reviewed nothing
[03:12.280 --> 03:20.680]  can be looked at no branch of government can look at it it went on and on and on and then
[03:20.680 --> 03:25.040]  they tried to deny that that was in the three page bill and then it came out that they lied
[03:25.040 --> 03:31.400]  so they lost even more confidence with the American people the tiny reservoir of a drop
[03:31.400 --> 03:44.200]  or two at the bottom of the well and then they changed their talking points this morning
[03:44.200 --> 03:49.640]  and I was running on the treadmill for 45 minutes this morning flipping back and forth
[03:49.640 --> 03:57.240]  on CNN headline news MSNBC CNBC Fox and it was all the same talking points in the same
[03:57.240 --> 04:04.520]  order over and over and over again because they understand the public now understands
[04:04.520 --> 04:11.160]  that the banking system is a parasitic organism that sits atop the real economy and that it's
[04:11.160 --> 04:18.720]  feeding the remnants of the real economy it's already cannibalized most of it and then it
[04:18.720 --> 04:25.600]  wants to feed the last little scraps into its gaping mall with its snagled fangs dripping
[04:25.600 --> 04:32.800]  venom and so now they've gotten a little more sophisticated they're they're talking to the
[04:32.800 --> 04:40.240]  public like the public might actually have opposable thumbs and they're saying oh no no
[04:40.240 --> 04:47.920]  no no no no we're going to basically IE the globalist going to destroy the real economy
[04:47.920 --> 04:54.720]  if you don't submit to us so this is outright economic terrorism in your face we'll be right
[04:54.720 --> 04:58.360]  back to break it all down right here on the GCN radio network

[08:08.600 --> 08:20.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network I have controlled myself in the last week and I tried
[08:20.600 --> 08:30.120]  to stay out of the presidential election diversion presidential election distraction I mean you
[08:30.120 --> 08:35.920]  could not get worse candidates than John McCain and Sarah Palin and of course Barack Obama
[08:35.920 --> 08:43.440]  and Joe Biden I mean there are so many bad things about each and every one of these candidates
[08:43.440 --> 08:49.400]  and both the selections of both parties that it is just unspeakable but we have to remember
[08:49.400 --> 08:54.240]  that they are puppets bought and paid for by the same institutions the same international
[08:54.240 --> 09:04.280]  banking crime cartel and evidence by that is how both parties both presidential candidates
[09:04.280 --> 09:13.160]  both VP candidates the leader of the house the leader of the Senate the minority leaders
[09:13.160 --> 09:20.600]  it is all the same talking points and they get new ones every day and you can I mean
[09:20.600 --> 09:26.360]  the literal talking points come out because simultaneously on every channel and on c span
[09:26.360 --> 09:32.200]  and the speeches they give it is all word for word the same thing and I wish we had
[09:32.200 --> 09:38.720]  the staff well we do we have the listeners it'd be great of all the great listeners
[09:38.720 --> 09:43.880]  that are on YouTube and all the other big video sites you really should go and grab
[09:43.880 --> 09:48.160]  all the other YouTube videos the last week and a half and just compare day by day how
[09:48.160 --> 09:53.720]  it's the same talking points and how there'll be a new talking point every day or two I
[09:53.720 --> 09:59.560]  mean that is control ladies and gentlemen a lot of people woke up 20 years ago independently
[09:59.560 --> 10:06.440]  of hearing a radio show like this one independent of reading some patriot newsletter and that's
[10:06.440 --> 10:10.240]  who was there first and resistance to the new world order and call the truth movement
[10:10.240 --> 10:14.880]  the liberty movement the reality movement the anti-corruption movement the pro humanity
[10:14.880 --> 10:19.320]  pro freedom movement but it really did start with the quote patriot movement this country
[10:19.320 --> 10:24.800]  worldwide this is the resistance gotta be proud that the core of what was america and
[10:24.800 --> 10:32.560]  the good attributes and aspects of our 234 year history express themselves in that remnant
[10:32.560 --> 10:37.800]  that kept the torch of freedom and liberty and and and true information alive so that
[10:37.800 --> 10:43.440]  greater fires could be lit with it later and with that tiny spark of reality that was
[10:43.440 --> 10:51.640]  left in the basic deluge of sports and mind control and madison avenue brainwashing that
[10:51.640 --> 11:00.240]  it was the hardcore paleo conservatives that wrote the course out of the waters were now
[11:00.240 --> 11:05.720]  in now will we take that course that remains to be seen but now that course is becoming
[11:05.720 --> 11:13.600]  very popular and people are discovering it by the millions on a weekly basis so if we
[11:13.600 --> 11:18.440]  had more time we would assuredly defeat the new world order unfortunately time is on no
[11:18.440 --> 11:27.600]  man side and things are deteriorating very very fast so
[11:27.600 --> 11:32.080]  i am blown away every night when i go to sleep and i woke up five or six times last night
[11:32.080 --> 11:37.200]  i would get up and pace around in the dark cold house i'd go in and look at my children
[11:37.200 --> 11:46.160]  look at my wife go in and hang over the baby crib and stare at the baby in the starlight
[11:46.160 --> 11:52.160]  and i just thought about how wild it is that out of them tens of millions of people resisting
[11:52.160 --> 11:59.920]  tyranny that this radio show is the most prominent and is the most dominant and i'm just struck
[11:59.920 --> 12:09.360]  with the soul shaking reality of the responsibility i have and i have to really control myself
[12:09.360 --> 12:25.520]  to not get frustrated by my lack of skills in many respects organization personnel research
[12:25.520 --> 12:30.680]  but in the final equation none of us are perfect none of us can do it all and so many times
[12:30.680 --> 12:33.880]  after i get off the air i say oh i meant to talk about this and i meant to talk about
[12:33.880 --> 12:39.720]  that and i meant to go over this facet and i even write pages and pages of notes up of
[12:39.720 --> 12:47.320]  ideas i want to go over sometimes and then i don't get to them i and some days i get
[12:47.320 --> 12:53.760]  on air and i just it's not that i even want to wait for them at all because i know i can't
[12:53.760 --> 12:59.760]  just tune out of it and live in denial and things be okay but at the same time i just
[12:59.760 --> 13:04.560]  want to do a better job and i don't even know why i'm going into this right now on air it's
[13:04.560 --> 13:14.080]  just we are in such incredible times right now instead of talking about the stage election
[13:14.080 --> 13:24.800]  or even the current economic rumblings and things that are going on we really should
[13:24.800 --> 13:33.600]  be talking about what we're going to individually do if a full board depression unfolds a what
[13:33.600 --> 13:42.280]  that depression will look like it's different manifestations that run from bad to worse what
[13:42.280 --> 13:46.880]  it will look like what life will be like how long it will go what the new world order is
[13:46.880 --> 13:58.720]  going to do during this contrived collapse so there's so much happening there's so much
[13:58.720 --> 14:09.120]  going on i saw mccain today saying that the economic stabilization the market stabilization
[14:09.120 --> 14:17.680]  packages that the treasury has can act on their own with hundreds of billions of purchases
[14:17.680 --> 14:26.880]  in the market of bad paper that they can move in for liquidity into the banks that's completely
[14:26.880 --> 14:39.280]  lawless mccain saying the president should just act alone and just lawlessly create out of nothing
[14:41.120 --> 14:49.280]  more credit i want in the sake of quote good radio but we're not in the business here of
[14:49.280 --> 14:54.880]  good radio we're in the business here of serious radio i mean it's the stuff radio is made of
[14:54.880 --> 15:01.520]  to sit here like everybody's finally doing i remember over the weekend thinking i remember
[15:01.520 --> 15:05.520]  last week thinking i've got to take these interviews with sarah paleon sound like a complete moron
[15:06.480 --> 15:15.600]  and i've got to play these on air right next to miss south carolina like i even said that last
[15:15.600 --> 15:20.480]  week others have picked up on that that it's almost identical in the bumbling mindlessness
[15:20.480 --> 15:26.880]  but see that's not funny it's not funny it's a sickening feeling i get when i look at this
[15:29.680 --> 15:34.400]  i mean why revel in the fact that the elite think so little of us they would give us this
[15:37.040 --> 15:38.720]  this bumbling moron
[15:42.480 --> 15:45.440]  so i want to talk about that i i just can't control myself anymore
[15:45.440 --> 15:52.400]  because you know it's not a distraction and a diversion if we laugh at it and make it a joke
[15:52.400 --> 16:00.320]  it's just a diversion but if we illustrate the fact that the elite are putting people into power
[16:00.960 --> 16:05.360]  that can be completely manipulated and controlled and have a lot of baggage then it's uh
[16:06.400 --> 16:07.440]  then it's informative
[16:07.440 --> 16:18.560]  but all of that is a side issue compared to the points i want to make right now very succinctly
[16:18.560 --> 16:25.200]  and then i'm going to go through each one of these points and flesh them out a little bit more
[16:27.440 --> 16:29.680]  and then i also open the phones up with a lot of guests too
[16:29.680 --> 16:38.160]  but over the phones up to specifically get your calls on the economy you know i don't mind
[16:38.160 --> 16:41.120]  not screening the calls and just saying what's your first name or where you're calling from
[16:43.600 --> 16:49.360]  but i also get irritated that we can have really big events happening
[16:50.880 --> 16:58.720]  like a 9-11 terror attack or an economic implosion with 1.2 trillion loss in the
[16:58.720 --> 17:04.000]  stock market one day and i know good and well when i open the phones up it's going to be
[17:04.000 --> 17:09.600]  person after person plugging their websites or things and hey that's okay i don't mind people
[17:09.600 --> 17:16.240]  doing that we're here to network folks but i really want to hear from callers specifically on the
[17:16.240 --> 17:21.840]  economy on the they're not calling it a bailout that term didn't work anymore so they're calling
[17:21.840 --> 17:31.520]  it the rescue package they shifted about a day ago from bailout to rescue package that sounds
[17:31.520 --> 17:37.520]  better oh you want to render aid you want to save a drowning child the rescue package
[17:39.600 --> 17:45.120]  i also want to get into i don't spend enough time on this i should make a film or somebody
[17:45.120 --> 17:53.840]  should just showing the psychology of the news readers and there are textbooks written on this
[17:53.840 --> 17:59.360]  and there are different schools of thought on it and it's changed from the older male authority
[17:59.360 --> 18:05.680]  figure very sternly telling you the news that was the old model and they've shifted in the
[18:05.680 --> 18:15.600]  last seven years or so almost entirely to supermodel females licking their lips and looking at you
[18:15.600 --> 18:21.200]  with sexual desire now they're not really looking at you they're looking at the teleprompter and
[18:21.200 --> 18:34.960]  then they now have the male anchors and contributors talk so genuinely and thank you and oh and so
[18:34.960 --> 18:40.480]  lovingly talking to you so the women sit there with sexual desire for the men
[18:43.360 --> 18:47.440]  and i mean they're finding the best at this i'm sitting there on the jogging on the
[18:48.560 --> 18:55.200]  treadmill and and and i'm having to you know have my cognitive more scientific
[18:56.720 --> 19:02.480]  regions of my brain stay in constant conscious control because on channel after channel there
[19:02.480 --> 19:08.640]  are just gorgeous women with glistening lipstick staring at the camera with total sexual desire
[19:10.640 --> 19:15.280]  while they spew lies and propaganda and pout their lips and then cut to men
[19:15.280 --> 19:21.840]  who are acting genuine and compassionate and loving that's for the women what the women want
[19:23.600 --> 19:29.600]  just like they're in love with you so sexual passion from a woman what men want lust and from
[19:29.600 --> 19:36.400]  the men they're staring at the women viewers with just genuine focus and concern like they're across a
[19:36.400 --> 19:46.560]  candlelit white linen dinner table with a french waiter pouring Dom Peyon and then there's the
[19:46.560 --> 19:52.160]  hovering mist and subliminals and five or six video feeds in the back to switch on the subconscious
[19:52.160 --> 19:56.480]  mind because the conscious mind can't gauge at all you know i want to warn the public this
[19:56.480 --> 20:03.760]  is mind control you understand that a day unlike any other in the long course of american history

[27:23.120 --> 27:29.360]  issue is what they're going to be talking about how there are those little pleasures in life
[27:29.360 --> 27:35.200]  like savagely stabbing the new world order in the gut with a double edged dagger of truth
[27:37.840 --> 27:39.920]  we're gaining a lot of momentum ladies and gentlemen

[27:47.280 --> 27:53.760]  in my life that put me on the path to uh not be one of these mindless idiots out in the street
[27:53.760 --> 28:00.080]  yeah there only maybe 10 of the population max but they are calling to talk radio going
[28:01.040 --> 28:09.440]  my 401k it's going down you gotta bail it out you gotta do the risky package
[28:11.120 --> 28:19.520]  your 401k is gone sir because the international bankers monetized it and then sold it into junk
[28:19.520 --> 28:25.120]  paper but you never you can't ever blame the elite because to you the elite doesn't exist because
[28:25.120 --> 28:31.040]  you're the elite you know you you got a basketball you're the elite or you got a badge and a gun
[28:31.040 --> 28:34.640]  you're the elite or you're a school teacher you're the elite or you're mcdonald's manager you get to
[28:34.640 --> 28:38.960]  boss people around you're the elite no you're not the elite okay there is an elite and you ain't it
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.640]  and the elite's very dangerous and they're and they're where they're at because they're ruthless
[28:44.640 --> 28:49.760]  and they're cunning and they will eat our lunch unless you grow up and be a man about things
[28:49.760 --> 28:54.160]  and start admitting there's a global crime syndicate in the new world order if you don't do that jack
[28:54.160 --> 28:58.480]  like 90 percent of people are starting to wake up and doing we don't have a snowball's chance in hell

[29:09.760 --> 29:13.760]  situation i've been kind of just eating around the edges of it throwing out some of the other

[30:02.320 --> 30:06.640]  i had the opportunity to speak to my 90 year old grandmother at some length here recently and she
[30:06.640 --> 30:10.720]  was talking about the great depression and we were talking about the gas prices the food prices
[30:10.720 --> 30:14.960]  this economic uncertainty we're in these you know really kind of perilous times no one knows where
[30:14.960 --> 30:18.960]  we're headed or where we might end up and she was reminded of the great depression and how in those
[30:18.960 --> 30:22.720]  days folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs and they could
[30:22.720 --> 30:26.960]  grow gardens and can their food but how difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in
[30:26.960 --> 30:30.800]  the cities because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how they didn't have the
[30:30.800 --> 30:34.960]  chickens in the livestock so it's a lot different for them well we know one thing's certain right
[30:34.960 --> 30:39.600]  now we're headed into much higher prices on food and there is a global food shortage now what can

[33:57.920 --> 34:01.760]  i'm glad because we don't have time to play around everything's going to hell in a hand
[34:01.760 --> 34:10.880]  basket we got to get the word out here there was a time when um when ted literally had
[34:10.880 --> 34:14.640]  memberships that even kept him afloat and what they're going to do is they're going to bump it
[34:14.640 --> 34:21.120]  up to like 120 something k and have special little reports and stuff uh for for all the shows and
[34:21.120 --> 34:26.880]  you'll still have memberships at genesis but i'm going to be offering my show all the archives
[34:26.880 --> 34:31.760]  for free and by the way i've been saving them for two years so it's going to go back two years
[34:32.400 --> 34:37.920]  now that is quite a job though uh to put those two years up so for the next few weeks
[34:38.960 --> 34:43.200]  then i'm sure we'll procrastinate it'll ever happen but for the next few weeks uh we're just
[34:43.200 --> 34:49.120]  going to start adding every day the new show right after it ends uh and uh so you'll have
[34:49.120 --> 34:57.200]  archives of the show not just the podcast i mean the podcast has been an archive
[35:00.640 --> 35:04.800]  well bottom line they just walked in and handed me some stuff that distracted their
[35:05.600 --> 35:10.000]  bottom line there's going to be archives of the show there for you uh and you also have the
[35:10.000 --> 35:16.720]  free podcast so that's how we get the word out that's how we reach out to people
[35:16.720 --> 35:22.720]  that's how we reach new people because we've never had more fertile ground
[35:23.600 --> 35:29.920]  than freedom lovers have now the the public is ready to receive the information they're ready
[35:29.920 --> 35:36.960]  to question authority and to use a world carbon tax to regulate our everyday lives and enslave us
[35:36.960 --> 35:46.480]  and so now like never before both in cyberspace which 70 plus percent of the western world
[35:47.040 --> 35:52.240]  is now online it's over 90 percent in south korea the most connected country in the world
[35:52.240 --> 35:55.680]  then 80 something percent in japan 75 percent or so in the u.s
[35:55.680 --> 36:04.240]  and you've got hundreds of millions of people coming online every few months
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.720]  and the enemy is certainly preparing to restrict to tax to shut down to curtail
[36:13.200 --> 36:19.520]  to to to govern the internet to to to govern it back to begin hacking pieces of it off
[36:19.520 --> 36:23.120]  to to make it more sluggish than force people in to internet too
[36:23.120 --> 36:29.520]  too but their plans are behind schedule their new world order program of consolidation
[36:30.560 --> 36:33.920]  is collapsing too fast they wanted to have more of a controlled
[36:33.920 --> 36:39.120]  gradual collapse that's in their own white papers they are not invincible they are not gods
[36:39.760 --> 36:45.600]  the technology has their own technology has gotten ahead of them the decision makers at the top
[36:45.600 --> 36:50.400]  are very evil wicked doddering on average 80 year old men
[36:50.400 --> 36:56.000]  men who can't understand what their advisors are even telling them thank god their younger
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.360]  advisors are not in control yet they will be soon crises have a way of shaking off
[37:01.920 --> 37:05.200]  the old deadwood and bringing in the younger more hungry demons
[37:10.720 --> 37:16.240]  but you're also going to have some of the sick offense who aren't even as hungry as their
[37:16.240 --> 37:26.560]  their overlords as their masters that brought them in as apprentice into the system and so in
[37:26.560 --> 37:32.560]  some cases you won't get younger and more evil and more hungry and more modern minds in control
[37:32.560 --> 37:36.560]  you will get the sick offense in what that brings a great out of element of danger
[37:36.560 --> 37:43.760]  but it'll be a mix of those and so great change is upon us the the new world order has tried
[37:43.760 --> 37:48.160]  to control the change they have controlled and governed a great deal of it but they have lost
[37:48.160 --> 37:54.480]  control because they've lost the confidence of the people both in the economic superstructure
[37:56.080 --> 38:02.640]  and overarching system but also just in basic confidence on political issues not just in the
[38:02.640 --> 38:10.240]  united states and europe but worldwide in different regions of the geopolitical kingdoms as the new
[38:10.240 --> 38:24.480]  world order calls them so there is an awakening and accelerating a a a a quickening that is taking
[38:24.480 --> 38:29.600]  place the evil is intensifying the good is intensifying those that are willfully want to be
[38:29.600 --> 38:35.600]  dumbed down they are more in denial and more in delusion than ever those that want to be awakened
[38:35.600 --> 38:44.080]  are accelerating their knowledge gathering their their understanding these are very very very
[38:44.080 --> 38:52.480]  very exciting times to be alive very perilous times but as the structure of the world architecture
[38:52.480 --> 39:01.440]  is liquefied unfrozen during this time of flux of change we the common people can be history's
[39:01.440 --> 39:10.880]  actors we can take control collectively at every level of society moving with one mind
[39:10.880 --> 39:20.560]  towards liberty and freedom and that is an unstoppable attack pattern that cannot be dealt
[39:20.560 --> 39:24.800]  with that cannot be intimidated or bludgeoned or backed off it is a
[39:24.800 --> 39:35.200]  a asymmetrical low intensity conflict in the info war but widespread in every strata and
[39:35.200 --> 39:42.800]  sector of society to the point of the enemy cannot react their propaganda systems are built
[39:42.800 --> 39:55.520]  along a widespread blanketing and dumbing down and is based on the drones still having
[39:55.520 --> 40:00.240]  confidence in the system and they have some specialized propaganda for different technocrats
[40:00.240 --> 40:08.880]  and different strata of the system gauging the psychology of those different niches in the
[40:08.880 --> 40:17.760]  overall human system but a lot of those individuals who were sold on going along with the evil
[40:17.760 --> 40:23.120]  but only given a small glimpse of it and they are now getting outside the box outside the
[40:23.120 --> 40:28.480]  compartmentalization and getting an idea of the true magnitude of the new world order and just
[40:28.480 --> 40:34.560]  how dark and destructive it is so a lot of them are pulling out of it most of them just passively
[40:34.560 --> 40:44.640]  but that's enough to bring it down alone they're finding out that they are not the pet puppies
[40:44.640 --> 40:55.120]  is more corny like to say they are not the chosen ones they are to be gutted and stuffed and taxidermied
[40:55.120 --> 41:07.920]  as well so the spell of self-assured giggling self delusion is beginning to evaporate I mean it
[41:07.920 --> 41:15.920]  always shocks me just how delusional the general public is and the elites are not immune from
[41:15.920 --> 41:22.480]  this either the different strata of elites again some guy that makes $400,000 a year
[41:22.480 --> 41:27.680]  and has a coveted membership at the local country club and lives in the $3 million house
[41:27.680 --> 41:32.720]  and has got a trophy wife they really think they're members of the elite because they go to luncheons
[41:32.720 --> 41:38.480]  when a senator comes into town and the senator you know has a list of names they memorize before
[41:38.480 --> 41:42.640]  the meeting and so they they say hello to the person in their first name and you know they're
[41:42.640 --> 41:47.120]  all on a big power trip thinking they've reached the crème de la crème of society
[41:47.120 --> 41:56.960]  just like in some one-horse town with 200 people living in it bubba johnson who owns the auto
[41:56.960 --> 42:04.320]  parts store in the one easy mart convenience store everybody stoopes and bows to him because his
[42:04.320 --> 42:12.800]  three brothers are the sheriff's deputies and he's got you know half the people in the town
[42:12.800 --> 42:21.360]  employed it is mini mart and it's the same thing you run into this in business and life and and
[42:21.360 --> 42:27.360]  i always talk about it but i'm really just now i'm beginning to understand it the public are on
[42:27.360 --> 42:32.560]  their own personal little power trips i mean they're walking around believing whatever delusion
[42:32.560 --> 42:37.040]  that's what dressing up fancy is all about and i'm not saying dressing up nice is bad
[42:37.040 --> 42:42.400]  you know it shows you have respect for yourself or you're trying to look nice or it's a special
[42:42.400 --> 42:47.200]  event but but for a lot of people it's turned into like a three-year-old a three-year-old girl
[42:47.200 --> 42:53.840]  dressing up in a princess outfit or a five-year-old boy dressing up in a green lantern outfit and it
[42:53.840 --> 43:03.760]  is this delusion and you run into these people who my corporation right or wrong my country
[43:03.760 --> 43:08.960]  right or wrong and they lie to themselves i mean they will try to teach you in business in a minute
[43:08.960 --> 43:14.400]  and then make up lies to themselves about you while they're trying to shanghai you
[43:14.400 --> 43:20.080]  while they're trying to bushwhack you or they'll lie about in a relationship why they're doing
[43:20.080 --> 43:35.920]  something or they will believe their own baloney believe their own bs and they will always overestimate
[43:35.920 --> 43:44.560]  themselves and it's a it's a false self-confidence you can people watch and watch people at the
[43:44.560 --> 43:50.880]  gym where they really posture or what because endorphins are flowing or watch people at the mall
[43:50.880 --> 43:56.000]  or watch them at church and the posturing i mean so much of our species is posturing
[43:56.560 --> 44:01.280]  and it's been said by philosophers the higher centers the higher development in humanity
[44:01.280 --> 44:08.320]  is about getting past the posturing and getting into veritas or truth and ideas and invention
[44:08.320 --> 44:18.080]  and literature and creativity and and and and being honorable and then you realize that so many
[44:18.080 --> 44:24.400]  people are living in delusion and that's why they don't want to be told the economy is built on a
[44:24.400 --> 44:29.920]  house of cards on sand that's why they don't want to be told there's a corrupt elite because then
[44:29.920 --> 44:33.040]  they might have to do something about it and then they don't want to hear that they're a slave
[44:33.040 --> 44:40.400]  why they're running things why you know they're powerful why the why the chief of police knows
[44:40.400 --> 44:48.400]  their name and tips his hat at them they like being suckers they like being maroons they like
[44:48.400 --> 44:59.040]  being schmucks they like being lied to they enjoy being fools because to a three-year-old
[44:59.040 --> 45:03.520]  child they really believe they're the fairy princess they really believe they're superman
[45:03.520 --> 45:15.440]  or batman or super scroll they really believe they're ben grim just like they really believe
[45:15.440 --> 45:24.880]  they're members of the elite it's just a new form of delusion and whereas you really could
[45:24.880 --> 45:29.040]  matter in history and you really could amount to something and your life could really mean something
[45:29.040 --> 45:32.800]  as soon as you figure it out it's about getting out of delusion and diversion and getting into
[45:32.800 --> 45:40.720]  reality and that all of your passion and all of your fire in the belly is not about yelling
[45:40.720 --> 45:45.680]  and screaming over your favorite football team that energy is about defending your tribe and your
[45:45.680 --> 45:52.160]  people against a tyranny that will always be manifesting itself there will always be evil
[45:52.160 --> 45:56.720]  in our species so there will always be a need for good to challenge it but they figured out how
[45:56.720 --> 46:05.680]  to seduce the public and the world into being not a race of men but a race of preening strutting
[46:06.320 --> 46:17.440]  peacocks we have been right about everything we've basically discussed but still i'm
[46:17.440 --> 46:23.040]  attacked on the radio nationally and locally local talk show hosts two of which have been
[46:23.040 --> 46:27.520]  sent recordings of the last week in austin so that i'm making stuff up about the economy and i'm a
[46:27.520 --> 46:38.400]  liar and i'm anti-american you know what the good news is though the public heard my predictions
[46:38.400 --> 46:44.080]  heard ron paul's predictions the other economists we had on and they know we were right and they
[46:44.080 --> 46:49.600]  know you're wrong and so see that's how it works you can only scam people so many times you can only
[46:49.600 --> 46:57.200]  con people so many times until they figure out you're selling a loadable and you can try to
[46:57.200 --> 47:02.320]  change horses in the middle of the screen you can try to change parties and fool people
[47:02.320 --> 47:05.760]  so many times but at the end of the day that doesn't work anymore
[47:05.760 --> 47:11.840]  and you can tell people
[47:14.400 --> 47:20.240]  but the economy is doing well when it's not and you will lose credibility
[47:21.680 --> 47:25.920]  now let me just get into some of the basics of the economy then i will go to uh joe rob alex
[47:25.920 --> 47:34.800]  scott tonion others first off it is the very same financial elite that created the current
[47:34.800 --> 47:41.920]  market situation i mean the very individuals paul sin and others that are now telling us
[47:41.920 --> 47:46.720]  they're going to save us while they're involved in conflict of interest transferring hundreds of
[47:46.720 --> 47:52.800]  millions of dollars of assets and liquidity into the companies that they still own large amounts of
[47:52.800 --> 47:58.560]  interest in and it's the same mainstream media and the same president bush and john mccain
[47:58.560 --> 48:05.360]  that told us the economy was doing absolutely peachy king and was marvelous and wonderful
[48:05.360 --> 48:09.360]  and anyone that said otherwise was a conspiracy theorist in the last two years and that's the
[48:09.360 --> 48:17.280]  exact words they use at infinitum like a flock of cockatoos repeating the same thing parroting it
[48:17.280 --> 48:23.600]  over and over again now in the last two weeks they begin engaging in financial terrorism
[48:23.600 --> 48:29.200]  them screaming from their high positions of power as treasury secretary as president as
[48:29.200 --> 48:34.960]  presidential candidates as leaders of the house and senate both parties that there would be a
[48:34.960 --> 48:46.480]  massive depression if blanket total immunity and power was not given to them
[48:46.480 --> 48:55.680]  that has been in all three versions of the bill and they're still defending it i saw a different
[48:55.680 --> 49:02.160]  white house spokesman on the lawn this morning on fox news saying that the community and the
[49:02.160 --> 49:10.560]  imperial power is good and still saying they support it so let's get that part straight
[49:10.560 --> 49:20.880]  there is no doubt that the fear mongering caused the biggest single drop in stock market history
[49:22.400 --> 49:31.360]  one trillion two hundred billion plus was one point two three one trillion two hundred
[49:32.640 --> 49:38.880]  plus billion lost in one day and then one of the terrorists do the talking point last night
[49:38.880 --> 49:45.120]  and today on every channel on every talk show we've got to get behind the bailout now and people
[49:45.120 --> 49:51.520]  calling in saying the feedback you know the talking heads say you won't have a 401k there'll
[49:51.520 --> 49:58.240]  be even more losses if you don't get behind this and then the people call in saying i know it's
[49:58.240 --> 50:03.120]  socialism and i know it's corrupt you know it's bad but my 401k you gotta save it
[50:03.120 --> 50:11.040]  the 401k is a dead duck because they wrote all that paper to buy up real assets they fenced
[50:11.040 --> 50:16.800]  and now they're leaving you holding the bag if they do this bailout your 401k when it crashes
[50:16.800 --> 50:25.280]  will crash even lower than the bottom is here but we'll see we'll see if the public buys it we'll be
[50:25.280 --> 50:34.400]  right back do you want to pay for the government bailout of fanny may and freddy mac you may have
[50:34.400 --> 50:40.080]  no choice obviously taxpayers are on the hook for over six trillion that's right trillion
[50:40.080 --> 50:45.600]  dollars in mortgages held by these two corporations the part that most people don't realize is that
[50:45.600 --> 50:51.840]  this bailout can have significant adverse effects on their 401ks and iras unless you're planning to
[50:51.840 --> 50:56.960]  help pay for this bailout with your personal retirement funds you need to act now the solution

[53:37.360 --> 53:55.200]  so 1.2 trillion lost in the stock market yesterday went up 200 something points
[53:56.160 --> 54:00.640]  today but didn't get anywhere near so far regaining its losses
[54:00.640 --> 54:05.840]  and much of it is infected with the junk paper
[54:08.880 --> 54:13.200]  but notice how the bankers did this they we told you two and a half years ago from Bilderberg
[54:13.760 --> 54:17.040]  that they were planning to blame it on subprime mortgages and that's also another part of the
[54:17.040 --> 54:21.760]  talking point well that started with the people the american people need to pay this it's not
[54:21.760 --> 54:25.840]  the bankers they haven't done anything wrong it's not the brokerage houses they haven't done anything
[54:25.840 --> 54:32.800]  wrong the american people did this and now the talking point today by both parties and all
[54:32.800 --> 54:39.280]  the pundits on tv is this is your fault you did this and main street will be destroyed if you
[54:39.280 --> 54:47.120]  don't bail out wall street and you're going to lose all of your pension funds and you're going
[54:47.120 --> 54:56.000]  to lose your ira's and then you're going to lose your savings hey folks if these bailouts and and
[54:56.000 --> 55:04.480]  this pardons are given to the financial institutions to take us into the next phase of their scam
[55:05.040 --> 55:13.440]  they will fully devalue the dollar and then that will destroy your savings and your investments so
[55:13.440 --> 55:21.440]  you see if we go with their plan it means total ruination but if we don't go with it they engage
[55:21.440 --> 55:29.920]  in financial terrorism and they don't have the federal reserve inject hundreds of billions
[55:29.920 --> 55:39.040]  of dollars into the economy and into the stock market and you get a trillion 200 plus billion
[55:39.040 --> 55:48.320]  dollar plunge so there is no doubt that we have never seen a president in more than 60 years get
[55:48.320 --> 55:53.760]  up on tv and talk about there will be a depression if you don't do this or that i don't believe it
[55:53.760 --> 55:59.200]  was ever even done before that i can't find a case no one i know no economist we've talked to has
[56:00.080 --> 56:06.880]  so weeks and weeks of fair mongering do what we say give us total immunity to do whatever we want
[56:06.880 --> 56:14.000]  it or there will be a total depression and mccain and bush and all of them including obama they're
[56:14.000 --> 56:20.800]  all up there saying if you don't get behind this bailout which they're now calling a rescue package
[56:21.360 --> 56:28.560]  there will be a depression which is another form of false flag they are engaging in terrorism
[56:28.560 --> 56:34.000]  they attack us with a military industrial complex attack and say that some foreign group did it so
[56:34.000 --> 56:39.200]  they can invade a bunch of sovereign nations that have nothing to do with it they tell us to do
[56:39.200 --> 56:46.080]  everything we say on the economic front make us imperial kings who there is no oversight over or
[56:46.080 --> 56:54.000]  there will be depression and then the congress says no because the calls were going 101 against it
[56:55.440 --> 57:00.960]  conservatively we had a congressman on yesterday that said he had over 2000 calls and five of them
[57:00.960 --> 57:09.440]  were for the bailout and so the media the government circles the wagons against the people there was
[57:09.440 --> 57:14.640]  ever an example of how it's the people against the media and the elite the global elite and the
[57:14.640 --> 57:21.520]  corporate media that's owned by them here it is both parties the leadership the entire dominant
[57:21.520 --> 57:25.520]  media saying we've got to have the bailout we got to have the rescue plan we got to do it we got to
[57:25.520 --> 57:31.440]  do it we got to do it we got to do it or there will be a depression and then the federal reserve
[57:31.440 --> 57:36.000]  didn't prop up the stock market yesterday the thing's totally rigged and they decided to quote
[57:36.000 --> 57:42.720]  teach you a lesson to panic you and then the new talking point comes out of c you didn't do what we
[57:42.720 --> 57:53.600]  said so a trillion 200 plus billion was lost yesterday so the big story here the big issue
[57:53.600 --> 58:01.600]  is that we're witnessing economic terrorism an economic gun to the world economy's head
[58:02.240 --> 58:07.120]  and worldwide they are blaming the congress for all the economic problems that are happening

[1:02:08.880 --> 1:02:15.440]  he and his uh... two sons after being uh... screwed you know of elliott spitzer the attorney general
[1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:23.520]  new york he has two sons jeffrey and um... ran marsh mclinin and evan greenberg ran ace limited
[1:02:23.520 --> 1:02:29.680]  cornered virtually the three of them father and son combination cornered the uh... the insurance
[1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:36.560]  industry worldwide now he was also a client close friend of hannery kissinger during the 80s
[1:02:36.560 --> 1:02:42.480]  and how do they do that through selective enforcement because they control the regulatory heads
[1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:49.360]  they allowed their company to engage in creating false assets through the paper scam to then corner
[1:02:49.360 --> 1:02:56.240]  other legitimate uh... structures in insurance and banking and now they are using federal regulators
[1:02:56.240 --> 1:03:03.680]  to go after solvent banks to forcibly consolidate to themselves absolutely and and then henry kissinger
[1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:08.960]  he was such a buddy of his that kissinger opened the way uh... for greenberg you know in the in
[1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:13.520]  the 60s during mousy tongue's era which was impossible to them to china and cornered the
[1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:19.440]  Asian market insurance he was all and then as a return favor he appointed duck kissinger um...
[1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:24.960]  the hong kong chief executives council of international advisors from 98 to 2005
[1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:29.840]  um... he also was a truck and then they got to design the architecture of who got to come into
[1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:34.960]  china and those first companies like walmart that did were able to then corner the manufacturing
[1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:40.400]  market and destroy all their competition not through free market but through controlled
[1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:46.960]  uh... crony uh... monopoly system absolutely in fact he's uh... greenberg henry was currently
[1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:51.840]  the trustee of the asian society he's a trustee emeritus of the rockerfeller university
[1:03:51.840 --> 1:03:58.000]  and honor a trustee of of the uh... rockerfeller foundation as well he donated 50 million dollars
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:04.560]  to yale university skull and bones in 2006 to advance yale's china collaboration
[1:04:04.560 --> 1:04:08.240]  i mean so the point is this and this is one of the things that maybe you can talk to dr paul craig
[1:04:08.240 --> 1:04:11.760]  roberton we wanted to bring this up when he's been on your show in the last several weeks but
[1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:16.800]  he's a he's a guy i love him dearly as great research but he seems to think that financially
[1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:21.520]  speaking you know even though he's right on the state police and how that's all being orchestrated
[1:04:21.520 --> 1:04:26.720]  he doesn't believe that this is all inside as far as bringing this well that's because he comes
[1:04:26.720 --> 1:04:33.200]  from the inside structure excellent call led from solder and copper pipes mercury from fish

[1:08:19.280 --> 1:08:22.480]  and in fact the establishment have been calling it on the order of 911
[1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:30.080]  they are the authors of the inside baseball scam they control the regulators a small group of banks
[1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:36.320]  i.e. the private federal reserve shareholders they regulate and control all the other banks
[1:08:37.680 --> 1:08:45.120]  and then other federal federal regulators put into power by this corrupt system regulate and
[1:08:45.120 --> 1:08:56.160]  control the insurance agencies and the stockbrokers the brokerage firms and so they created thousands
[1:08:56.160 --> 1:09:04.880]  of trillions of fake paper hundreds of times bigger than the entire real global economy
[1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:10.160]  and they are looting everything they know they're bringing the dollar down they know
[1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:14.080]  they're bringing down the world financial system they've had kissinger and the head of the kissinger
[1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:18.000]  group and a bunch of others we've had stories up on info wars dot net by steve watson excellent
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:22.160]  ones in the last week you should go read it we should play those video clips of them on television
[1:09:22.160 --> 1:09:28.400]  saying it saying we need a new world order we need a global regulatory banking system of every
[1:09:28.400 --> 1:09:39.440]  nation only that will stop further crises so this inside group who control the regulators who control
[1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:45.840]  the liquidity they have flooded the world with all this fake paper they bought the mines and the
[1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:53.040]  stocks and the defense stocks and the real estate and the media companies they bought up the real
[1:09:53.040 --> 1:10:01.200]  infrastructure and then now as the derivatives come home to roost which is hundreds of times
[1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:05.840]  greater than all the real assets in the world they're blaming it on less than a hundred billion
[1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:10.320]  and subprime mortgages which could have been paid off for less than a hundred billion they're
[1:10:10.320 --> 1:10:17.760]  claiming that caused all of this to blame it on the people as usual and so they terrorized for
[1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:23.120]  two weeks saying if you don't pass this bailout there will be a depression no president no treasury
[1:10:23.120 --> 1:10:29.520]  secretary ever talked like that then they don't have the president's working group on the markets
[1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:39.040]  the plunge protection team they they have them stand down they have them stand down yesterday
[1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:44.640]  so a trillion two hundred plus billion can be lost in the stock market and then they say okay
[1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:50.640]  it's going to go down even further unless you the american people and i saw john mccain say this
[1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:55.040]  the american people don't understand doesn't matter what's unpopular we've got to do this
[1:10:55.040 --> 1:11:00.960]  sit down and shut up and it's still in the provision to give immunity but not just immunity it
[1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:05.360]  nothing can be reviewed by the treasury to make it a fourth super branch of government
[1:11:05.360 --> 1:11:10.800]  above everything with no oversight the very criminals that engineered this and now they
[1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:16.000]  said they want to create a new world government banking body over the crisis caused by the american
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:21.840]  people and the very bankers that engineered it all now want to stampede us into accepting a
[1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:26.400]  world government banking system will buy our carbon credits from them that's the new bubble
[1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:31.680]  they want to create it's amazing for the rest of the hour when we'll be taking your calls for him
[1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:36.720]  coming up at the bottom of the hour is an amazing individual i've seen him on russian tv iranian tv
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:42.240]  i've seen him on british television he's one of the top financial presenters for al jazeera english
[1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:46.160]  he's a blogger for the huffington post one of the biggest alternative media sites in the world
[1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:52.240]  he's also the host of weekly radio talk show about the markets on resonance fm in london which i'm
[1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:57.920]  also a routine guest on other shows on that fine station and it just goes on and on and on he has
[1:11:57.920 --> 1:12:02.800]  a daily podcast he's also an inventor he invented the hollywood stock exchange and a lot of other
[1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:10.160]  things we're really honored to have him on with us for the next 47 minutes uh mr kaiser so much
[1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:13.920]  is happening can you just give us the basics you've been predicting this for a long time
[1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:20.080]  of what we're really facing who the insiders are and and where they're trying to take things
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:26.320]  versus where the congress is trying to take things saying no to the rescue package they
[1:12:26.320 --> 1:12:31.200]  i guess i think bailout is a good enough con name so now it's the rescue looting package
[1:12:31.200 --> 1:12:36.560]  break it down for us yeah sure alex thanks for having me on the on the show you know
[1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:44.400]  i was listening earlier you were mentioning about the uh sexification of the evening news and um i am uh
[1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:49.760]  i think about in cnbc when they have uh maria barter romo if you've ever seen that show
[1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:56.000]  oh yes that shot of her standing on the floor of the new york stock exchange and she is basically
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:03.200]  the female egg that is surrounded by hundreds of male sperm trying to penetrate the egg and
[1:13:03.200 --> 1:13:10.160]  that shot from a uh just from a visual is quite stunning when you put it in that context uh you
[1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:15.440]  know can't talk about releasing the animal instincts in the economy and then i'm sure
[1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:20.720]  that she's launched more or by themselves based on that one shot of her surrounded by all those
[1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:27.200]  hungry all those active sperm then probably at any bailout package uh ever conceived yeah this is a
[1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:33.360]  archetypal image and the psychological warfare experts are masters of it it is taught uh by
[1:13:33.360 --> 1:13:38.320]  the pr firms but the public doesn't understand that this is how it's done anyway i'm on the
[1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:44.160]  financial side of it you know what people get bogged down in the jargon and and the the terms
[1:13:44.160 --> 1:13:50.000]  that are used by the finance media to try to confuse people but it's really you know you
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:56.240]  break it down you know words like derivatives for example you know i think people would benefit
[1:13:56.240 --> 1:14:00.320]  if they just kind of understood a little bit more about what this whole idea of derivatives are if i
[1:14:00.320 --> 1:14:05.440]  can just spend a few minutes oh listen i'm just going to sit here you just run you know the think
[1:14:05.440 --> 1:14:10.640]  about a derivative if you think about it you got to go back to remember the dot com craze of the late
[1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:16.800]  nineties a lot of these dot com companies did what was called banner swapping where company a and
[1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:22.800]  company b would swap let's say a million dollars with the banners these banners had no intrinsic
[1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:29.200]  value at all but both companies would book the transaction as a short-term gain and both companies
[1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:35.280]  would book the long-term life you know the the loss is a long-term liability do you think about that
[1:14:35.280 --> 1:14:39.520]  in terms of what the banks have been doing for the past five to ten years it's kind of a sophisticated
[1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:45.200]  version of this banner swapping where bank a and bank b so both swap a billion dollars with the
[1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:51.280]  derivatives these derivatives have no intrinsic value whatsoever but both bank a and bank b will
[1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:56.960]  book the immediate sales of profit that'll drop down to the bottom line that'll boost the stock price
[1:14:56.960 --> 1:15:02.400]  which will trigger an option payment to the executive and both bank will consider the loss
[1:15:02.400 --> 1:15:08.160]  as a long-term liability but don't have to worry about for 10 20 30 years now what happened what
[1:15:08.160 --> 1:15:12.960]  that's just if you look in that context you understand that what's been going on is just
[1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:17.280]  billions hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars worth of what are intrinsically
[1:15:17.280 --> 1:15:23.520]  inherently worthless transactions but they generate these huge amounts of fees for the people involved
[1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:28.240]  and for 10 or 15 years they could get away with it because for 10 or 15 years really all going
[1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:36.000]  all the way back to the early 1980s the trend in the market in the bond market specifically has
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:42.560]  been one where interest rates have been for the most part going down so this has covered up a
[1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:51.520]  lot of sins over the past 10 15 20 years and so has the trade deficit exactly because that is
[1:15:51.520 --> 1:15:58.080]  essentially a number that keeps building but you know a lot of those numbers never hit the actual
[1:15:58.080 --> 1:16:04.080]  balance sheet for example you know the number like the uh the the gdp number or the inflation
[1:16:04.080 --> 1:16:09.600]  number the employment numbers a lot of these numbers are not are are massaged and we made a
[1:16:09.600 --> 1:16:15.520]  film for this a couple of films about on this very topic and but what happened last summer alex and
[1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:22.400]  the reason why this crisis really hit was that starting last summer you had this long-term
[1:16:22.400 --> 1:16:28.560]  trend and interest rates reversed itself and interest rates started to tick up and what happened
[1:16:28.560 --> 1:16:35.520]  was the the hologram that is this global financial system started to be shut off and these banks
[1:16:35.520 --> 1:16:40.080]  started to have to realize that what they were carrying that had come clean if they look this
[1:16:40.080 --> 1:16:46.400]  doesn't actually have any value whatsoever and this triggered this what i call a hologram a global
[1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:53.280]  financial hologram i guess you know to start a trigger uh that could be continuous and the
[1:16:53.280 --> 1:16:59.680]  contiguous uh requirement from various banks to recognize that what they were holding was in fact
[1:16:59.680 --> 1:17:06.400]  worth nothing and this kept building and building now this uh this this effort right now by the
[1:17:06.400 --> 1:17:12.000]  congress to put a gun to the to the head by the front by wall street to put a gun to congress
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:18.240]  to set and say look we need another seven hundred billion dollars to keep the the Ponzi scheme going
[1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:26.800]  you know it's it's uh it's money that basically is uh it's not going to really put any dent into
[1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:34.000]  the into the fact that the underlying economics that we're talking about here have shifted away
[1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:38.960]  from from the ever being able to continue this game any further there's not going to change
[1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:44.400]  anything they get it's a black hole it's a black hole yeah effectively it has become
[1:17:45.200 --> 1:17:49.280]  effectively it has become a financial black hole you could shovel seven hundred billion
[1:17:49.280 --> 1:17:54.960]  a trillion three trillion it won't make any difference the the structural integrity is going
[1:17:54.960 --> 1:17:59.760]  to collapse well this is like a house that's on fire and the firefighters try to put it out by
[1:17:59.760 --> 1:18:06.480]  throwing giant truckloads of kindling on it pretty much this is actually making the problem a lot
[1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:13.200]  worth by throwing uh and also remember when they talk about putting money into the into the problem
[1:18:13.840 --> 1:18:18.800]  they're not actually putting any money into the problem they're putting credit into the problem
[1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:23.200]  and what does that mean it just means that the you know the in the american banking system and
[1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:27.760]  the global banking system works on the fractional reserve requirement and so they're always level
[1:18:27.760 --> 1:18:32.480]  that's the point all this money and nine hundred and forty billion blended out last week alone

[1:23:54.160 --> 1:24:00.400]  guest said max keiser they have a gun to our head and then driving down the stock market
[1:24:00.400 --> 1:24:04.960]  yesterday with all their bad mouthing and with the different financial powers the treasury has
[1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:09.520]  to then threaten the public into submit to us or it's over what are they really after here and
[1:24:09.520 --> 1:24:14.800]  what's happening max keiser well just talk a little bit about how to affect the market down
[1:24:14.800 --> 1:24:18.640]  turn you know as you mentioned i designed the technology for the hollywood stock exchange
[1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:22.560]  which became the basis for what are now called prediction markets these are online markets
[1:24:22.560 --> 1:24:28.560]  using virtual currencies and i used a lot of the technology that was uc used on the floor
[1:24:28.560 --> 1:24:34.640]  of the new york stock exchange which is the specialist system and for example the government
[1:24:34.640 --> 1:24:41.040]  in this case the those who are interested in um getting a buy-in from the american public through
[1:24:41.040 --> 1:24:46.640]  having the stocks crash and the fear that would come as a result of that you don't have to actually
[1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:51.840]  sell the stocks per se although they are actively buying and selling stocks you know as you pointed
[1:24:51.840 --> 1:24:57.920]  out after the 87 crash reagan and greenspan and robert rubin created the working group on finance
[1:24:57.920 --> 1:25:01.760]  which is euphemistically now called the plunge protection team i was working on law street at
[1:25:01.760 --> 1:25:07.280]  the time i was on law street the day of the crash and i remember that quite vividly and i remember
[1:25:07.280 --> 1:25:13.120]  reagan's speech and what greenspan had to say about that but this technology has evolved so
[1:25:13.120 --> 1:25:17.440]  you don't actually need let's say the government or whoever's selling it by the way you know jp
[1:25:17.440 --> 1:25:21.440]  morrigan enrollment stocks have very very close ties to the government out to the sumitomo bank
[1:25:21.440 --> 1:25:27.520]  in japan and various other central banks they control a very large central pool of capital
[1:25:27.520 --> 1:25:37.120]  that is used ostensibly for currency control because after 1971 the world went off
[1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:42.560]  the gold standard you know the u.s closed the gold window and he went on a pure fiat currency
[1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:48.560]  standard this means the government had to keep their currencies somewhat in line to affect
[1:25:48.560 --> 1:25:53.200]  global trade well that's been abused over the years so that the government is now using that
[1:25:53.200 --> 1:26:00.960]  mechanism to as we see now to make political policy by making prices move and in the case of
[1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:05.360]  these prices on the derivative exchanges and the bond market you don't actually have to go in there
[1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:11.680]  and change the price per se you just need to change the ratio required that creates a down tick or
[1:26:11.680 --> 1:26:16.720]  an up tick for example on the hollywood stock exchange or any virtual market if i want to make
[1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:23.200]  it so that stock prices go down i simply change the ratio required of a sale versus a buy that
[1:26:23.200 --> 1:26:28.080]  would affect the down tick and if you affect that change you create anyone who comes in with a
[1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:33.600]  sell order that sell order is magnified versus a buy order so every sell order suddenly is worth
[1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:38.880]  a hundred seller and if you simply change that technology you're not actually buying or selling
[1:26:38.880 --> 1:26:44.000]  anything you're just you're just playing into somebody's emotion because as we know from economics
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:50.240]  and finance there's a lot of emotion involved and if you start to see prices tick down you then are
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:56.560]  emotionally you're kind of drawn into it and you panic and you sell more readily and this is very
[1:26:56.560 --> 1:27:02.000]  easy for them to do this now i had an issue a few years ago because the pentagon was launching
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  under point dexter they were launching a virtual market called the policy analysis market or PAM
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:12.720]  where they wanted to make features contracts based on future terrorist events or try to predict
[1:27:12.720 --> 1:27:18.160]  terrorist events and i was adamantly against it was going to be betting on terrorist events which
[1:27:18.160 --> 1:27:23.840]  by the way they could trigger when they wanted to do what i was my point you say they they go out
[1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:31.200]  there with this message that markets are fair and markets are you know are able to affect a
[1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:37.040]  certain equilibrium that's true if you let if you leave them alone but you know we don't have a free
[1:27:37.040 --> 1:27:42.480]  market it is rigged it's completely rigged i made a film called rig markets for Al Jazeera nobody
[1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:47.520]  in america would broadcast the film only Al Jazeera broadcast the film i made a movie for Al Jazeera
[1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:52.720]  called death of the dollar death of the dollar two talking about how the dollar and the markets
[1:27:52.720 --> 1:27:58.160]  were rigged and nobody in the u.s would broadcast it uh in the uk and our radio show i said that
[1:27:58.160 --> 1:28:01.920]  bratford and bingley three years ago i said bratford and bingley is going to collapse
[1:28:01.920 --> 1:28:06.880]  because of what they were doing in the market they just recently collapsed i said fanny main
[1:28:06.880 --> 1:28:11.920]  frayback were going to collapse they collapsed by the way that's why you're here we see hundreds
[1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:16.720]  of these experts who have you and in different sites have done the analysis who are wrong about
[1:28:16.720 --> 1:28:21.280]  80 percent of the time but that's why the establishment puts them there is to lie and
[1:28:21.280 --> 1:28:27.200]  mislead people and people like ron paul yourself uh and really hundreds of other economists like
[1:28:27.200 --> 1:28:32.080]  like joe stiglitz uh they are almost always right but then you hardly ever see them on tv
[1:28:32.960 --> 1:28:37.920]  yeah i i i follow those guys work or you know maybe what i bring to it is understanding the
[1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:43.840]  technology of money and and that's going off the gold standard money has become and financial
[1:28:43.840 --> 1:28:48.160]  engineering has become the biggest product in america america doesn't make stuff anymore
[1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:55.520]  they they export um exchange units and and bonds and currency as an exchange for stuff
[1:28:55.520 --> 1:28:59.440]  and you have a word basically they they're the man behind the curtain running of the
[1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:05.280]  different Ponzi schemes that's right and it's worked very well up until last summer because
[1:29:05.280 --> 1:29:12.080]  when interest rates which are basically the the secret sauce of any golden tax jp morgan
[1:29:12.080 --> 1:29:17.120]  derivative product structured vehicle special hold on stay there max geyser dot net it will be
[1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:25.280]  right back to break that down and more we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones

[1:33:08.240 --> 1:33:15.840]  head are yes max keiser website max keiser.net keiser spelled k-e-i-s-e-r that links to him
[1:33:15.840 --> 1:33:22.000]  up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com he is internationally known and he's known in europe
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:27.520]  japan asia russia england uh... but of course here in the u.s. because he'll tell you the truth
[1:33:27.520 --> 1:33:33.120]  he's not known because the financial hologram the false reality as he properly calls it i love
[1:33:33.120 --> 1:33:43.440]  that term uh... it owns the the the corporate media the pr firms uh... that are there to sell
[1:33:43.440 --> 1:33:48.880]  you lies and uh... now we see the ponzi scheme coming to an end the question is will they be
[1:33:48.880 --> 1:33:54.000]  able to set up their new international order and give themselves global governmental powers
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:59.760]  to enforce a new order that's what they do they they create crises scam everybody and then poses
[1:33:59.760 --> 1:34:05.440]  the saviors into the next phase and so he's giving us a lot of technical information which is very
[1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:09.760]  valuable and i don't want to say dumbing it down but but you know even for people like myself who
[1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:14.480]  try to follow it uh... you've been very good at predicting what's gonna happen uh... there's
[1:34:14.480 --> 1:34:19.280]  different scenarios that could unfold all of them not good for the average person uh... most of them
[1:34:19.280 --> 1:34:25.360]  not good even for the elites that are running all of this but uh... i mean break down well
[1:34:25.360 --> 1:34:30.160]  what it means that congress said no now the fear mongering of all of you made the market go down
[1:34:30.160 --> 1:34:35.360]  one trillion two hundred billion the biggest stock market drop ever uh... in the total
[1:34:35.360 --> 1:34:40.320]  numbers ladies and gentlemen i mean there's so many facets to this but but where do you see it
[1:34:40.320 --> 1:34:46.960]  going max kaiser well the question is are the markets being manipulated and the question is
[1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:52.480]  yes they're being manipulated and uh... i think again you know my predictions that i've made
[1:34:52.480 --> 1:34:58.720]  have been based on looking for how and when markets have been manipulated and then understand
[1:34:58.720 --> 1:35:04.080]  who's manipulating them why they're manipulating them and then you can make some predictions
[1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:11.680]  based on that you know after uh... the nine eleven collapse you know green span dropped interest rates
[1:35:11.680 --> 1:35:16.800]  to a very very low level he was manipulating the interest rate market and he was doing so in my
[1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:22.480]  opinion because he wanted to say faith you know that the idea was we can't show the bad guys
[1:35:22.480 --> 1:35:27.680]  that we're gonna stop shopping we're not gonna we don't want to interrupt our uh... you know our
[1:35:27.680 --> 1:35:32.160]  model here in the the america seventy percent consumption so they drop those interest rates
[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:36.640]  very low in a very manipulative way and it's created you know uh... there should have been
[1:35:36.640 --> 1:35:41.520]  a recession in two thousand one two thousand two because of the dot com collapsed but that
[1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:46.160]  recession never happened green span simply reinstated the bubble by keeping those rates
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:53.520]  too low as a way to really overcompensate uh... for those attacks because those attacks um
[1:35:53.520 --> 1:35:58.640]  you know they there was only a recession baked into the cake they overcompensate the manipulated
[1:35:58.640 --> 1:36:03.440]  rates down and so now it's worse today and then they're going to pop it up again making it even
[1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:10.000]  worse in the future you know they did bubble reinflated yet the real estate bubble it popped
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:14.720]  now what's in that bill that they're trying to circulate unbelievably there's a clause in the
[1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:20.800]  bill that would move to reserve less banking they want to have the american banking system
[1:36:20.800 --> 1:36:25.120]  go from having one or two or three percent reserves on the balance sheet for the loan
[1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:32.240]  to zero reserve less banking that's like saying we're going to be moving to an economy based
[1:36:32.240 --> 1:36:35.200]  on a currency that's collateralized by chicken feathers
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:40.000]  ha ha ha that's absolutely nothing in there they want to have an economy that's pure
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:44.960]  transaction they want to still generate fees and falls from the laundromat the seven hundred
[1:36:44.960 --> 1:36:50.080]  billion dollar laundromat all they do is it's a circular laundromat the bad debts go in
[1:36:50.080 --> 1:36:55.200]  and then get nice fresh tea bills that are completely uncollateralized freshly printed come out
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:37:02.160]  there's a lost book and that book lost is going to go as a uh an item on the balance sheet to be
[1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:06.160]  paid for but i don't call them the american taxpayer because there's no such thing anymore you have
[1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:12.800]  only the american debtors you have debt slaves that fit you know i call it the the american duck
[1:37:12.800 --> 1:37:22.800]  farmer floglock you know i'm laughing max geyser but the bankers are laughing but who gets left
[1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:29.200]  holding the bill sure it's all fiat for them and they buy real things with it and you know the
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  empires are bought and paid for in wars but then we are left holding the bag and so now they're
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:43.680]  trying to go from a fiat system to a complete hologram uh forecast i mean where is it how is
[1:37:43.680 --> 1:37:49.680]  this going to end well it's yeah i was interested in very struck by the story out of the uk there's
[1:37:49.680 --> 1:37:54.800]  a banker in the city of london he was a rich banker what an elite i guess you could call
[1:37:55.360 --> 1:38:02.560]  um who just killed himself through himself from a freight train because this you know part of it
[1:38:02.560 --> 1:38:09.200]  part of the situation here i'm convinced that the bankers like are are almost worshiping
[1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:15.680]  death in a lot in some ways for example goldman's tax you know they create bonds that they themselves
[1:38:15.680 --> 1:38:19.840]  are destroying in their back office they're completely schizophrenic you know they were
[1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:25.040]  doing this uh as part of the uh buildup to the dot to the uh meltdown the real estate market
[1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:30.880]  the story here how golden profited from the subprime meltdown talking about how the day
[1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:35.520]  themselves were issuing bonds to finance the subprime while shorting the bonds at the same time
[1:38:36.240 --> 1:38:41.600]  so they they have us an internal schizophrenia that that's almost like it's psychotic so i think
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:45.040]  that's one of the elements when you talk to a lot of your guests on your show you talk to eminent
[1:38:45.040 --> 1:38:49.040]  economists and the question all comes up why are they doing this it seems like they're shooting
[1:38:49.040 --> 1:38:55.520]  themselves in the foot i'm pretty sure that there's a certain element you know i of psychosis i call
[1:38:55.520 --> 1:39:01.600]  it almost as if bank paulson has become like colonel kurt he's going up river and he's surrounding
[1:39:01.600 --> 1:39:06.080]  himself with the bankers and he's trying to destroy you know he's trying to destroy the
[1:39:06.080 --> 1:39:11.760]  entire world and no one can find him no one can get to him he's become it's a classic situation
[1:39:11.760 --> 1:39:17.040]  isn't it when somebody in a democracy assumes dictatorial power we've seen that before well it's
[1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:22.960]  narcosis it's it's it's narcosis like when you're diving too deep and you are high as a kite i mean
[1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:27.040]  it's just it it's the same thing and they're building up a police state to suppress us when
[1:39:27.040 --> 1:39:31.120]  they repossess everything you know they believe there's a method to their madness and their argument
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:36.560]  is hey if we can create unlimited paper and buy up all the real assets and then leave the schmucks
[1:39:36.560 --> 1:39:43.680]  holding the bag uh so what but the problem is the people aren't buying into what they're saying i
[1:39:43.680 --> 1:39:48.480]  want to go to some calls but uh first off max keiser and the website's max keiser dot net
[1:39:48.480 --> 1:39:54.160]  dot com dot com well there's a whole bunch of them here then well well well whose website is
[1:39:54.160 --> 1:40:00.320]  dot net then but that's me also i have dot dot com is where we can't have all the headlines
[1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:06.480]  okay is that we have some um information about the organization but dot com all the headlines
[1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:12.160]  where people come in to get the daily uh follow the money headlines fantastic we've got links to
[1:40:12.160 --> 1:40:19.920]  both now i just haven't had the net one in front of me right now now looking at this play out uh
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:26.240]  do you think the establishment was counting on congress saying no to the bailout a b
[1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:31.440]  do you think they'll be successful now with the financial terrorism during a break you likened it
[1:40:31.440 --> 1:40:36.960]  to the uh terror alert and every time rumsel needed money or there was a political problem they
[1:40:36.960 --> 1:40:40.720]  would just declare that al qaeda was about to attack and the public would buy that for a while
[1:40:40.720 --> 1:40:44.640]  until they stopped buying it i mean what are they going to do in the short term was this a defeat
[1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:49.440]  for them or were they counting on that so they could then throttle the stock market and then
[1:40:49.440 --> 1:40:55.200]  get the public to acquiesce to this uh to signing on to it i think it wasn't a feat i think it was
[1:40:55.200 --> 1:41:00.880]  a bit surprising and uh but i also think that as we described they can do pretty much anything
[1:41:00.880 --> 1:41:05.920]  they want to the market and it scares people and as we were saying it's just like a terror alert
[1:41:05.920 --> 1:41:10.160]  that you used to get you know and every time pentagon wanted more money they'd hit the red
[1:41:10.160 --> 1:41:16.240]  alert and suddenly there was uh an alert everyone was hiding under their death and they the pentagon
[1:41:16.240 --> 1:41:22.320]  got a huge new influx of money for their budget similarly they're using the market in this similar
[1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:27.840]  way you know you've you've mentioned it in terms of financial terrorism etc and i don't think that's
[1:41:27.840 --> 1:41:32.800]  far from the actual truth but based on what i know in terms of how markets can be manipulated we
[1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:36.880]  talked about the policy analysis market for a second which was that market on terror futures
[1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:43.280]  and the the room for abuse for that is incredible because now you've got people directly profiting
[1:41:43.280 --> 1:41:48.080]  from manipulating a market and then when they take their profits they can simply say well
[1:41:48.080 --> 1:41:52.560]  it wasn't us it was the market see that's the tall grass everyone runs into every time is that
[1:41:52.560 --> 1:41:56.480]  there's a crash or something like this they say well it wasn't us there was the market and nobody
[1:41:56.480 --> 1:42:00.960]  knows the market that's completely incorrect at this at this stage of the game did this market
[1:42:00.960 --> 1:42:07.120]  the prices on these stocks bonds currencies are being managed they're being targeted for an effect
[1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:11.600]  if they think that it's going to take a certain percentage drop in the dow Jones to pass this
[1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:17.120]  bill they will get to that price and they can do so using the technology they have and using the
[1:42:17.120 --> 1:42:22.960]  relationships that they have there is no buy and sell as that notion is understood in a free market
[1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:28.560]  and you know Ron Paul is absolutely rightly says that you know to paraphrase he talks about
[1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:33.040]  there that the free market is really not at work in the united states you've got now
[1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:37.600]  something that looks like the free market but it's being operated by people who are using it
[1:42:37.600 --> 1:42:43.040]  as a scare tactic that's clear i can see that as a as a as an expert if you will on the technology
[1:42:43.040 --> 1:42:47.440]  of markets that have been involved for 25 years i can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that
[1:42:47.440 --> 1:42:53.200]  these markets are being manipulated for political end well they admit they are and at the same time
[1:42:53.200 --> 1:43:00.160]  we it's more than just insider trading it's insider regulation it's the ultimate and in fact uh
[1:43:00.160 --> 1:43:06.000]  and i want your take on this but i would say that this is the that the term conflict of interest
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:14.480]  isn't strong enough for just Henry Paulson alone with Goldman Sachs it's a cult there's a cult
[1:43:14.480 --> 1:43:18.480]  there's a cult of personality it's not just a conflict of interest it's like saying that
[1:43:18.480 --> 1:43:25.600]  Charles Manson a squeaky farm at a conflict of interest there it's a cult of of of insiders
[1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:31.440]  who worship the market they believe in something called market fundamentalism the same way extremist
[1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:38.000]  theocrats believe in you know religious fund extremism or fundamentalism these are market
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:45.920]  fundamentalists they believe in the market as in as this entity that they're willing to do these
[1:43:45.920 --> 1:43:50.800]  things in the name of the market and it's it's a counterpart to what we see in other areas
[1:43:50.800 --> 1:43:56.240]  of the world what what will we call religious fanaticism or extremism these guys are market
[1:43:56.240 --> 1:44:04.240]  extremist and the result is equally damaging well it takes the the term that you know markets are
[1:44:04.240 --> 1:44:08.960]  based on confidence to a new level where they just say we can commit any crime break any rule
[1:44:08.960 --> 1:44:14.480]  meanwhile at a congressman on yesterday uh burgers and a lot of others are saying that
[1:44:14.480 --> 1:44:19.920]  that the reason they're voting against this uh the package yesterday was because there is so much
[1:44:19.920 --> 1:44:25.200]  insider opportunism going on and then earlier you just mentioned you know the fact that there
[1:44:25.200 --> 1:44:31.200]  will be no reserves uh in this banking but that's only in a select inner group from the way I read
[1:44:31.200 --> 1:44:36.880]  it because right now they're sending out regulators that are allied to the inner coterie or the inner
[1:44:36.880 --> 1:44:42.080]  crime syndicate and they're feeding on other banks and using their regulators to basically
[1:44:42.080 --> 1:44:46.960]  engage in predatory actions against parts of the market that aren't in as much trouble as they're
[1:44:46.960 --> 1:44:52.720]  saying I mean is there any reality to that yeah absolutely the Glass-Steagall Act as you know
[1:44:52.720 --> 1:44:59.040]  was put up there after the crash of 29 as far as the securities act of 33 and 34 the SEC put up
[1:44:59.040 --> 1:45:02.800]  the Glass-Steagall Act to separate banks and brokers because they're naturally cannibalistic
[1:45:03.360 --> 1:45:10.240]  now under Clinton actually uh the Glass-Steagall was repealed which gave these banks and brokers
[1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:16.880]  the ability to collude again and what we're seeing now is these rapacious vampire-like debt
[1:45:16.880 --> 1:45:22.560]  sucker black hole banks they need fresh blood so they're going after these small deposits these
[1:45:22.560 --> 1:45:27.520]  small banks and they're going after that and they're stealing their deposits to help to feed the
[1:45:27.520 --> 1:45:33.040]  black hole to feed their extremist view of the way markets should be active so anyone who's got
[1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:37.840]  money in a bank in the United States you know they're being targeted by these guys who want
[1:45:37.840 --> 1:45:42.960]  that fresh blood that fresh cash that is they're not insured at over a hundred thousand dollars
[1:45:42.960 --> 1:45:49.120]  they want that fresh cash to feed their their uh their repacious debt you know spinning
[1:45:49.840 --> 1:45:56.000]  fee generating model that it just doesn't work again you know I mean not not to always quote
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:02.080]  Ron Paul but he does make some excellent points as he points out systemically the situation is
[1:46:02.080 --> 1:46:07.600]  broken so it doesn't matter how much money you throw at it if the model is broken it doesn't
[1:46:07.600 --> 1:46:12.560]  make any sense just to continue the model the model has to be revisited or it needs to be
[1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:19.680]  re-architected so that you have genuine supply and demand all right max kaiser.com's the website
[1:46:19.680 --> 1:46:23.360]  max kaiser is our guest I want to get to your phone calls rork who disagrees will go to the
[1:46:23.360 --> 1:46:27.440]  head of the line but I've got to ask this question before we go to calls and the time we have left
[1:46:27.440 --> 1:46:31.120]  with you today we got on a bit late because of phone problems without I apologize to the listeners
[1:46:31.120 --> 1:46:40.080]  but again you can find out more about our guest at max kaiser.com max where is it going you predicted
[1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:43.760]  years before you know each bank that was going to go under you and others were able to see the
[1:46:43.760 --> 1:46:50.160]  basic market fundamentals and break that down where is it going what is going to happen how bad
[1:46:50.160 --> 1:46:56.960]  is this depression going to get how long will this sustain how do you see things settling out on the
[1:46:56.960 --> 1:47:04.000]  other end will the architects of this this this this criminal vortex be able to hoax us into
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:09.600]  positioning themselves as the saviors and setting up a new global government based on banking a new
[1:47:09.600 --> 1:47:14.800]  order where they go around regulating everybody else I mean that's what they're saying they want
[1:47:14.800 --> 1:47:21.520]  to do or will they fall yeah depends on the american people the american people still have it within
[1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:28.720]  their means to push back and I'll give you an interesting something to think about for you
[1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:33.920]  and your listeners basically the way what they're fighting the american people with the ultimate
[1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:40.240]  weapon that they use is inflation basically that's the weapon they're going to inflate the value of
[1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:45.760]  your currency down to zero the us dollar so that you end up back in the poor house where you were
[1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:50.960]  and your family were generations ago so therefore it stands to reason that the only way to fight
[1:47:50.960 --> 1:47:57.360]  inflation is with deflation now give an example I suggested this a couple years ago and I was
[1:47:57.360 --> 1:48:02.400]  immediately smeared by the white the right-wing press in america but it was written up by a
[1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:08.080]  bank here in europe she grew bank as the ultimate weapon for effort activists that are looking to
[1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:13.520]  fight back think of it this way if deflation is the only thing that can fight inflation then why
[1:48:13.520 --> 1:48:18.800]  not target your deflation why not get together as a community as an american community and say you
[1:48:18.800 --> 1:48:24.720]  know what we've got the power to make these markets reflect our interest and what you can do for
[1:48:24.720 --> 1:48:31.680]  example is you look at these stocks you look at a stock that might be vulnerable to the only weapon
[1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:36.960]  that an impoverished person has at their disposal which is a boycott it works for gondi it works for
[1:48:36.960 --> 1:48:43.600]  marnivore king jr the boycott is the no-cost weapon of choice is there a company out there that's
[1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:50.240]  vulnerable to a boycott on that effectively pushing deflation against inflation or what's
[1:48:50.240 --> 1:48:56.000]  called a monopsy versus you're fighting them monopoly well i agree with the plan the power of
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:00.880]  the boycott of course is legendary the problem is we have an alternative media it's big it's
[1:49:00.880 --> 1:49:06.320]  growing but it's splintered we don't have that mass transmission power they have to put out the
[1:49:06.320 --> 1:49:11.520]  talking point on every channel and so how do we communicate an effective boycott how do we pick
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:16.240]  an effective boycott target i'll give you i'll give you the motivating force is going to be greed
[1:49:16.880 --> 1:49:20.240]  let me tell you something to you and your listeners how would you like to be
[1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:25.840]  how would you like to make money using the same tools that they're using against you here's what i
[1:49:25.840 --> 1:49:30.240]  suggest if you take a company that's vulnerable and i'll give you a company and it's not because
[1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:34.560]  they're a bad company it's because they're vulnerable although you could make the case
[1:49:34.560 --> 1:49:40.160]  that they do a bad thing if you take a company like copepola for example it's trading at uh close
[1:49:40.160 --> 1:49:46.240]  to four times sale for every dollar you don't spend a coax products you're going to cut four dollars
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:52.000]  off their market cap if it's a sufficient number of people join that boycott two things happen
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:58.720]  number one the revenues start to go down number two the same hedge fund that are attacking you
[1:49:58.720 --> 1:50:03.520]  and your savings and attacking you and your your you know american dollars are going to attack
[1:50:03.520 --> 1:50:09.520]  coax stocks so you're drawing the same forces of capitalism in your favor so it's like putting blood
[1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:15.200]  in the water you you draw in bigger sharks to attack the sham move exactly and it shows if you
[1:50:15.200 --> 1:50:19.600]  can if the american people can take down a hundred twenty billion dollar company just to show that
[1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:26.320]  they can deflect their muscle to bring deflation against this inflation they're gonna feel mighty
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:30.960]  good about themselves it's like the boston tea party no taxation they're represented all right
[1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:36.960]  max keiser stay there i'm alex jones heart disease is on the rise clogged arteries high blood pressure
[1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:42.960]  and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you but the symptoms are there loss of energy
[1:50:42.960 --> 1:50:48.160]  blood sugar spikes and drops poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these

[1:54:10.720 --> 1:54:16.640]  it is an illusion and before he leaves us i'm going to challenge him to really get into what
[1:54:16.640 --> 1:54:22.160]  how bad he thinks it's going to get how he predicts it will play out because we haven't seen anything
[1:54:22.160 --> 1:54:26.880]  yet but i want to go to your calls right now let's talk to roark in texas he's the last caller in
[1:54:26.880 --> 1:54:31.920]  line but he goes to the head of the line because he disagrees go ahead roark here on the air hello
[1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:40.720]  alex hello max yes i called in today because i believe money is a trick i believe the economic
[1:54:40.720 --> 1:54:48.320]  ideologies that exist are tricks and i believe that communism fact our socialism and capitalism
[1:54:48.320 --> 1:54:55.760]  our degrees of fascism and i believe the suit solution is a free manufacturer is a free market
[1:54:55.760 --> 1:55:02.000]  but money is control and so i think an even freer solution is that of a free manufacturing base
[1:55:02.880 --> 1:55:07.120]  yeah but you know you've called before and and then you don't really flesh out
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:14.240]  your idea nothing is quote free uh someone has to take their time of energy to build it
[1:55:14.240 --> 1:55:22.160]  and then they're going to have to sell something to pay for it well if there's no money there wouldn't
[1:55:22.160 --> 1:55:27.360]  be any need yeah and we go back to the stone age sir that's why they had no i can't talk to you
[1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:35.120]  i appreciate your call yeah i can do that if i might okay go ahead um the um if you look at
[1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:40.160]  um if you look at what's happening in the open source movement with the software you know that
[1:55:40.800 --> 1:55:47.280]  has really uh lined us turbo in north europe of course and the linux gave rise to this whole
[1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:53.040]  idea of free software and uh richard stallman the free software movement and it really is a worthwhile
[1:55:53.040 --> 1:55:58.880]  economic model to have um free software distributed freely uh certainly google is a huge multi
[1:55:58.880 --> 1:56:03.360]  billion dollar company giving away free information effectively that is contributed to them by others
[1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:07.840]  so this is interesting history because of the frictionless nature of the internet
[1:56:07.840 --> 1:56:12.560]  you can add what's it what are called return uh increased return economics where you're you're
[1:56:12.560 --> 1:56:18.800]  getting back something actually um using free free labor well let's be clear i'm not saying
[1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:23.440]  that you can't have barter with information technology systems that that doesn't accelerate it
[1:56:23.440 --> 1:56:28.320]  but he's called in and said you need to build a factory and not charge for what comes out the end
[1:56:28.320 --> 1:56:33.760]  of it so and i mean that guy's called before and i've talked to him and i he i'm not going to be
[1:56:33.760 --> 1:56:41.520]  mean i'm not a dude can read about richard stallman and then call back i mean to your caller that
[1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:47.440]  would be what i'm saying is money can be manipulated and it does become a lie but but i mean money
[1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:53.040]  whether it's tally sticks or gold coins uh you know you need to have some symbol of exchange because
[1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:59.920]  in a complex society you've got to have ways of of of of you know greasing the skins of the market
[1:56:59.920 --> 1:57:04.640]  or your or it's i mean it would be stone age overnight yeah you need a means of exchange
[1:57:04.640 --> 1:57:09.600]  okay no no question about it for the exchange of goods and services and money fulfills that role
[1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:14.640]  and there's a way to manage it so that you know it's not being abused the way it is now unfortunately
[1:57:14.640 --> 1:57:20.000]  in the u.s uh because the way it's set up you end up with those who are in the money business
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:24.720]  that co-opting the political process so that the political process makes it easier to be in the money
[1:57:24.720 --> 1:57:29.680]  business and that's unfortunately now at a point where the money business is the only business
[1:57:29.680 --> 1:57:36.320]  in america really it's to be predominant exactly the fiat made up uh smoke and mirrors banking
[1:57:36.320 --> 1:57:42.080]  system is gobbling and eating up the entire real economy and when we come back i want to get your
[1:57:42.080 --> 1:57:48.400]  taking one minute on well let me start now where do you see this going well it's uh i think you
[1:57:48.400 --> 1:57:54.480]  know you're talking about an inflationary depression so you're going to talk about unemployment
[1:57:54.480 --> 1:58:01.600]  going back up to you know 10 15 20 20 percent if you look at the unadjusted numbers uh that's
[1:58:01.600 --> 1:58:06.800]  unemployment america is already over 10 the real number you're looking for that to double all right
[1:58:06.800 --> 1:58:18.640]  stay there we'll be back in 70 seconds with max thank you for listening to gcm be sure to visit gcm

[2:00:13.920 --> 2:00:18.800]  one post two different radio programs and he's our guest for today really appreciate
[2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:24.240]  his time you were finishing up with uh... in the short term in the midterm long term
[2:00:25.600 --> 2:00:31.680]  how you see things unfolding and i'd like to also ask you how do you see the architects of this
[2:00:33.280 --> 2:00:37.440]  banking hologram this fraud how do you see them responding what do you see them doing
[2:00:38.480 --> 2:00:42.240]  uh... yeah well i don't know here in terms of virtual money
[2:00:42.240 --> 2:00:47.200]  very interesting to tear wagging the dog you know that on intrade which is a virtual market
[2:00:47.760 --> 2:00:54.000]  the contract for the probability of the bailout packaging failing in congress two days before
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:01:00.240]  it failed crashed so the insiders and inside information is legal on intrade we're trading
[2:01:00.240 --> 2:01:05.920]  and making bets that's it that's a contract would crash now with that knowledge of course
[2:01:05.920 --> 2:01:11.360]  if you applied it to the smp futures contract in new york and you went short the market yesterday
[2:01:11.360 --> 2:01:15.440]  you would have made a killing so here you have virtual markets virtual money
[2:01:15.440 --> 2:01:20.240]  based on aggregating opinions generating a price signal which is getting people in
[2:01:20.240 --> 2:01:25.200]  new york and chicago around the world to buy actual buy smp futures and make a ton of money
[2:01:25.200 --> 2:01:30.960]  based on virtual money so that's how we're at in this in this phase of capitalism where it's all
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:36.400]  virtual money and there's no underlying there there you can still make tons of it based on
[2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:42.240]  reading these virtual markets and virtual currency and you've just got to take the virtual money
[2:01:42.240 --> 2:01:48.160]  before the market implodes and you've got to get into real assets you know land uh...
[2:01:48.160 --> 2:01:53.760]  well the smart money is obviously buying gold and silver because it's completely scarce
[2:01:53.760 --> 2:01:57.840]  you know you can't go buy gold and silver these days at the spot price because the
[2:01:57.840 --> 2:02:03.200]  the market is exploding the paper price which is on the futures exchange is a manipulated price
[2:02:03.200 --> 2:02:08.160]  that's another purely manipulated market and how long until shockingly manipulated
[2:02:08.160 --> 2:02:11.520]  that is one of the worst cases of manipulation in the silver market
[2:02:11.520 --> 2:02:14.240]  that i have seen with naked short selling in the whole work
[2:02:14.240 --> 2:02:18.960]  for in 25 years are looking at markets being manipulated if the silver market is by far
[2:02:18.960 --> 2:02:24.160]  the most egregious example of market manipulation i've ever seen but that's what i was gonna ask
[2:02:24.160 --> 2:02:29.760]  you next is we have this war between the fiat hologram of the bankers what they say on paper
[2:02:29.760 --> 2:02:35.440]  gold and silver and copper and other things are worth these commodities versus what they are in the
[2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:40.480]  real economy where they're becoming extremely scarce who's going to win that fight let me give
[2:02:40.480 --> 2:02:48.160]  you my prognosis okay i have a term which i call neo feudalism in other words we're going back to
[2:02:48.160 --> 2:02:55.040]  lords and serfs oh yes i i like that term up yeah okay so when this is all over you're gonna have
[2:02:55.040 --> 2:03:00.480]  you know those with a ton of money in their vaults golden silver land whatever in the private
[2:03:00.480 --> 2:03:04.800]  army mercenaries you know blackwater and the crew are going to be moving into america soon
[2:03:04.800 --> 2:03:09.280]  you know they're battle hardened troops are going to be in the u.s uh we went to to patrol the
[2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:13.440]  streets again by the way that's already been announced by the army times regular army it said
[2:03:13.440 --> 2:03:17.920]  for the american people yes that's completely we are now the enemy of north com declared enemies
[2:03:17.920 --> 2:03:22.400]  yes that's what i mean if you can how can you get any more against the constitution than that that
[2:03:22.400 --> 2:03:29.520]  i mean that that's that that's what i mean or anyone who is conscious of anyway so you've got
[2:03:29.520 --> 2:03:33.680]  the standing army now in the u.s they're going to be patrolling the streets so you've got these
[2:03:33.680 --> 2:03:38.320]  basically it's an aristocrat you've got lords the only reason we have a middle class alex to begin
[2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:44.080]  with the only reason we you and i exist to begin with is because 400 years ago during the bubonic
[2:03:44.080 --> 2:03:49.280]  plague the aristocrats started paying more for people to come manage their state because there
[2:03:49.280 --> 2:03:56.000]  weren't as many people because of the first time uh there was not a glut of human labor exactly and
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:04:01.120]  that was the beginning of the middle class and it and it and it morphed from there to what we call
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:08.000]  you know the american dream was the ultimate middle class you know uh you know people and they knew
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:12.560]  they had to get rid of the manufacturing base and other things to economically convert back to
[2:04:12.560 --> 2:04:18.400]  neo serfdom neo feudalism and man i'll tell you max kaiser we're going to get you on a lot more
[2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:22.400]  let's come back i i just could have you on for the whole show but we've got to get to some of these
[2:04:22.400 --> 2:04:26.800]  phone calls on the other side i agree with you that's it uh ladies and gentlemen it's going to be

[2:08:21.600 --> 2:08:26.800]  somebody here the john Wayne of the future okay oh come on man hey hey i want to state something
[2:08:26.800 --> 2:08:32.720]  here because what happens is i get idolized or or max keiser does or ron paul does and then we
[2:08:32.720 --> 2:08:38.080]  think oh he's handling it they're there it's extraordinary to be fighting this i don't want
[2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:41.680]  to be a serf and a slave well let me just say something and i'm gonna let you talk you've
[2:08:41.680 --> 2:08:45.120]  been holding a while but let me just say this because and i'm not mad at you praising me and
[2:08:45.120 --> 2:08:50.320]  i appreciate it makes me work hard but but the bottom line is this what what max keiser just
[2:08:50.320 --> 2:08:56.560]  said they plan to make us total serfs with a boot on our throat every facet of our lives
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:03.120]  manufactured through the government system this is stated i am angry and threatened by that i am
[2:09:03.120 --> 2:09:08.960]  fighting through self-serving reasons because i don't want to be a slave so i want to just get
[2:09:08.960 --> 2:09:13.520]  this straight to everybody out there what i'm doing is the minimum ladies and gentlemen
[2:09:13.520 --> 2:09:18.880]  okay because i went and witnessed marines training to take our guns and put us in fema camps
[2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:24.960]  in the late 1990s this is a long-term plan they have planned all of this and but go ahead and
[2:09:24.960 --> 2:09:30.880]  make a point well the point is that the nation and the people nowadays alex you you are an
[2:09:30.880 --> 2:09:36.080]  inspiration because people are so dumbed down to find people to actually be able to communicate
[2:09:36.080 --> 2:09:42.240]  with now is unbelievable but let me get to the point uh we got 770 billion dollars or
[2:09:42.240 --> 2:09:47.520]  wanting to give away to these uh gangsters get to pay off their own debts and to keep themselves
[2:09:47.520 --> 2:09:50.960]  and then they lie and say it's not really money it's going to make money then that's
[2:09:50.960 --> 2:09:55.600]  and sorry go ahead no it has nothing to do with anything that's just to cover their own tails
[2:09:56.160 --> 2:10:03.680]  but you know if you took a 770 billion divided by let's just say there's a 200 million people
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:08.800]  over 18 years of age divide that up amongst them give it to them i don't know what the figure is
[2:10:08.800 --> 2:10:13.200]  i think it's like 300 000 or something let everybody pay off their mortgages let everybody
[2:10:13.200 --> 2:10:18.160]  go buy new cars let's put it into the economy on a part of the way and like you had the money
[2:10:18.160 --> 2:10:23.760]  bomb you know for the for the shows earlier if we could get a money bomb put together just for
[2:10:23.760 --> 2:10:30.400]  billboards just for all the listeners of you know of info wars and alex joneshow to get down in
[2:10:30.400 --> 2:10:34.880]  their pocket to know what's coming down the pike to know that they're going to take all your money
[2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:40.080]  let's get something positive let's get the billboards up it says what the 270 or the 770
[2:10:40.080 --> 2:10:46.640]  billion they do for 200 million american adults over the age of 18 and let's get info wars on
[2:10:46.640 --> 2:10:50.960]  the bottom of those uh and let's just play that thing i think it's not too late to do it if it
[2:10:50.960 --> 2:10:55.200]  could be done rob i appreciate your call let me just say this and get back to our guests max
[2:10:55.200 --> 2:11:01.120]  keiser max keiser dot com we did a money bomb because somebody already started one and just
[2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:06.720]  did it separate from me so i said okay i'll support it now i've been hustling in the last four months
[2:11:06.720 --> 2:11:11.600]  to get a bigger office uh it was already planning it uh you know to build a little better tv studio
[2:11:11.600 --> 2:11:16.400]  and radio studio and i'm trying to deal with people building it and with bids and all that
[2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:20.880]  so i'm not that big an organization if i tried to raise a couple million dollars probably what we'd
[2:11:20.880 --> 2:11:26.640]  raise buy some billboards as a drop in the bucket that's old media the power of you the listener
[2:11:26.640 --> 2:11:31.680]  taking action telling people about the show on am or fm or shortwave or internet or satellite the
[2:11:31.680 --> 2:11:36.400]  power of you calling into talk shows see people are thinking centralized they're thinking about
[2:11:36.400 --> 2:11:42.240]  going to alex jones and i and and that's fine but but the point is it's about all of us taking
[2:11:42.240 --> 2:11:48.320]  action in little ways every day and having your voice heard now we don't have time to launch
[2:11:48.320 --> 2:11:52.800]  a money bomb raise the money put billboards up i'm not bashing that idea and certainly we need
[2:11:52.800 --> 2:11:57.680]  support by the books by the videos support our sponsors and then we can do more but
[2:11:57.680 --> 2:12:02.400]  i don't think that i'm the center of the universe in this fight it's all of us together in a freedom
[2:12:02.400 --> 2:12:10.240]  movement a reality movement against the false reality movement the hologram max keiser in our
[2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:17.200]  warm buffer just um two years ago warned that america was going to become a nation of sharecroppers
[2:12:18.400 --> 2:12:23.120]  he said that publicly what does that mean and entered servitude here's the richest guy in the
[2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:27.680]  world or richest guy in the united states admitted saying openly america will become a nation of
[2:12:27.680 --> 2:12:32.400]  sharecroppers he also said that he expects in a few years americans to be paying income tax to uncle
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:40.160]  sam and to china i just want to buff it that's not alex jones and max keiser that's warm buffett
[2:12:40.160 --> 2:12:44.720]  is undercover of fortune magazine every a few weeks you know he's a very respected guy he's one of
[2:12:44.720 --> 2:12:50.480]  the guys architecting this so-called bailout he himself has said american to become a nation of
[2:12:50.480 --> 2:12:57.360]  sharecropper and let's be clear he is one of the kingpins organizing and running this and then he
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:13:03.040]  tells you like he cares about you but really he's just letting you know because they don't want
[2:13:03.040 --> 2:13:07.840]  private capital they don't want a middle class they are and i want the cops to know this the cops
[2:13:07.840 --> 2:13:12.640]  in the military the reason you've been given black masks and trained to haters and tasers
[2:13:12.640 --> 2:13:17.040]  is you are going to be there to help destroy your own country max keiser what would you say to the
[2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:21.760]  functionaries uh who are having trouble getting their mind around this what would you say to them
[2:13:21.760 --> 2:13:27.920]  what would you say to them unfortunately you know we've had 20 years of a uh a bull market that
[2:13:27.920 --> 2:13:34.480]  everyone has become trying to death of losing their uh money that they've accumulated and
[2:13:34.480 --> 2:13:40.160]  they are unwilling to see a bigger picture and americans from what i can tell have lost touch
[2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:46.400]  with the struggle that came before this recent generation and it looks like they're gonna lose
[2:13:46.400 --> 2:13:50.960]  it they're gonna lose it all and they're gonna go back you know it's like uh that game of uh
[2:13:50.960 --> 2:13:55.440]  slides and ladders you know this is a huge slide all the way back to the beginning you know the
[2:13:55.440 --> 2:13:59.920]  idea of rebuilding the country from scratch and getting those rights you know um it was recently
[2:13:59.920 --> 2:14:06.320]  said that let these banks collapse just let the banks collapse you know every american is gonna if
[2:14:06.320 --> 2:14:11.280]  they let the banks collapse they might be broke but if they still have their freedom if they still
[2:14:11.280 --> 2:14:16.480]  their liberty they've got everything they need to rebuild the economy from scratch and have a
[2:14:16.480 --> 2:14:22.240]  brilliant economy they happen in 1907 instead we're being held hostage by the very institutions
[2:14:22.240 --> 2:14:29.360]  that engineered this saying now give us everything and sign on to this and make us kings or you're
[2:14:29.360 --> 2:14:33.680]  gonna lose it when they're the ones that have set it up and and and what you said is so key
[2:14:33.680 --> 2:14:40.000]  mccain obama all of them on tv are saying the same thing both parties they're saying the banks pay
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:46.320]  the payroll the banks open the sonic hamburgers up if it wasn't for the banks you wouldn't have a
[2:14:46.320 --> 2:14:53.280]  pot you know to piss in or a window to throw it out of they're literally saying that as if the
[2:14:53.280 --> 2:14:59.040]  banks are everything and you're absolutely right we need these parasites off our backs now and it's
[2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:04.800]  going to be tough but if we give in to them it's over okay you got out of the grocery store in
[2:15:04.800 --> 2:15:10.480]  the last two or three years the prices are skyrocketing price of gas is skyrocketing in
[2:15:10.480 --> 2:15:16.640]  atlanta half the gas stations are closed that's one of the top 10 biggest cities in america the
[2:15:16.640 --> 2:15:21.600]  bankers are destroying the country you know they they're trying to hypnotize people into thinking
[2:15:21.600 --> 2:15:26.400]  that they've got the answer but again the the message to anyone in the u.s. should be let the
[2:15:26.400 --> 2:15:31.440]  banks fail we can take it we can take the punch you know take the punch and let them rebuild
[2:15:31.440 --> 2:15:35.920]  some scratch but if you give us this money and you take away our freedoms we're going to end up
[2:15:35.920 --> 2:15:43.280]  with no money and no freedom well they did a good job i talked to again several congressmen
[2:15:44.160 --> 2:15:49.360]  on and off air and they said that they were getting about 2000 phone calls for every three
[2:15:49.360 --> 2:15:55.920]  or four or five calls for the scan out for the stick-up job and i guess in the final equation
[2:15:55.920 --> 2:15:59.920]  you know that's the good news they said no then but then the bankers slammed it down the biggest
[2:15:59.920 --> 2:16:05.440]  one-day loss in history of the stock market 1.2 plus trillion and uh do you think the public will
[2:16:05.440 --> 2:16:10.640]  buckle or mccain was talking about today just the treasury ignoring congress and the people and
[2:16:10.640 --> 2:16:17.920]  doing it with some mechanisms they've got unfortunately these rights of the u.s. citizens
[2:16:17.920 --> 2:16:23.040]  have been systematically stripped you know the patriot act there's many items in there
[2:16:23.040 --> 2:16:29.520]  the u.s. i have a prediction a running prediction right now i i kind of feel that this election
[2:16:29.520 --> 2:16:34.560]  in november is going to be postponed because of this financial crisis and that therefore the
[2:16:34.560 --> 2:16:39.040]  even because bush has the ability under the uh forget which rule it is i think you actually
[2:16:39.040 --> 2:16:45.120]  know that pdd 51 right right exactly he gives him the ability under any circumstance to declare
[2:16:45.120 --> 2:16:50.080]  what is effectively martial law now if in fact this bailout does not go through i kind of thought
[2:16:50.080 --> 2:16:54.240]  today what was going to happen is that they were good the market was going to crash around the world
[2:16:54.240 --> 2:16:58.320]  and then bush would come out and say we're going to enact that rule and i'm going to make the bailout
[2:16:58.320 --> 2:17:03.520]  go through myself george bush right now because i think you need it in that case it came over
[2:17:03.520 --> 2:17:10.560]  there it's like 1931 and hitler just took power and they're citing the the threat of a financial
[2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:14.800]  collapse like hitler decided the threat of communism it's completely absolutely let's jam
[2:17:14.800 --> 2:17:22.560]  in the final call or to scott arizona quickly for our guests go ahead yeah i agree with them 100
[2:17:22.560 --> 2:17:27.840]  percent i believe that and my god like i've said before i believe that bush is not coming out and
[2:17:27.840 --> 2:17:32.800]  i believe that uh... even if we go through with this bill it's only going to last a few days
[2:17:32.800 --> 2:17:36.400]  and they're going to bring us down and everybody starts kicking our car our currency around the
[2:17:36.400 --> 2:17:40.640]  world which is going to then come to the next crisis where they're going to say you know the
[2:17:40.640 --> 2:17:44.400]  bailout didn't work instead of having another bailout we need the new currency while we're
[2:17:44.400 --> 2:17:48.480]  losing our freedoms they've got everything they want i i do believe that the elections will
[2:17:48.480 --> 2:17:52.080]  be suspended i've been filling out for a long time so i think he's right on the money well i
[2:17:52.080 --> 2:17:57.120]  don't know why army times was reporting north com activating against the american people and you
[2:17:57.120 --> 2:18:02.720]  know they declared marshal on congress uh... monday and sunday i mean it's it's just getting crazier
[2:18:02.720 --> 2:18:08.400]  and crazier very quickly uh... tony in chicago last caller our guest is leaving us in one minute
[2:18:08.960 --> 2:18:15.360]  hey hey alex i just yeah he's right you know in 2004 there was an article in the trip about

[2:25:34.800 --> 2:25:39.280]  how wonderful he is and how wonderful mccain and barack obama are so you have all the mainstream
[2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:44.560]  media and both parties leadership saying the people are bad saying the congress are bad
[2:25:44.560 --> 2:25:49.600]  saying everything's our fault when they are the ones that control the plunge protection team and
[2:25:49.600 --> 2:25:54.640]  they're the ones that clearly drove the market down yesterday this is just too rich it is there's
[2:25:54.640 --> 2:25:58.960]  an awful lot of manipulation going on and the president right now is trying to pitch this thing
[2:25:58.960 --> 2:26:05.120]  i was looking at a picture of a benark benarky benarky and uh and uh bush and the uh uh
[2:26:05.120 --> 2:26:09.840]  pulsing mr malarky benarky yeah right exactly i mean they're just all lined up together and i
[2:26:09.840 --> 2:26:14.000]  thought you know i don't think bush should be standing in amongst those people i mean you
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:18.160]  you're talking about doing political suicide of course he's not going to be voted in again
[2:26:18.160 --> 2:26:22.480]  no no he's a hero to the globalist bringing america down i mean that's his been his job
[2:26:22.480 --> 2:26:26.560]  feeling conservative just long enough to slit their throats i mean he's a rock star of the new
[2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:32.080]  world order he sure is alex and he definitely wants to sell this company out of this country out i
[2:26:32.080 --> 2:26:36.560]  mean we have there is so much going on in the marketplace right now there is absolutely no
[2:26:36.560 --> 2:26:41.520]  reason for congress to come to a consensus and agree on this bailout but by the way said you're
[2:26:41.520 --> 2:26:47.840]  right this is a globalist corporate takeover of the us they bankrupted us on design by design
[2:26:47.840 --> 2:26:52.240]  and now we're sending in their brainwash police they are and they want us to bail out not only
[2:26:52.240 --> 2:26:56.000]  country companies that are located here in the united states they wanted us to bail out the
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:27:01.200]  foreign companies as well i mean right now it this is nuts and they've been pushing this line
[2:27:01.200 --> 2:27:05.440]  of bull that we're gonna make money from this that bill sets the precedent for them to spend
[2:27:05.440 --> 2:27:11.280]  any amount of money they want it isn't about 700 bill and it's going to be like that it's going
[2:27:11.280 --> 2:27:15.840]  to be like the patriot act you know they're going to continue to the you know it'll it'll come to
[2:27:15.840 --> 2:27:20.080]  its expiration date and they'll forward it further and they'll forward it further and it's just going
[2:27:20.080 --> 2:27:24.720]  to become a regular way of life that the united states government is going to continue to bail
[2:27:24.720 --> 2:27:29.760]  out these companies with our money but it's not a bailout again now they're calling it a rescue
[2:27:29.760 --> 2:27:35.920]  package what it is is kicking the the trigger to drop the gallows and drop the american people
[2:27:35.920 --> 2:27:41.040]  through and snap our little necks uh... to tell folks about the golden silver offer you've got
[2:27:41.040 --> 2:27:46.640]  you've got it again at below what it's trading for today an insane deal you heard our last guest
[2:27:46.640 --> 2:27:51.520]  on saying you're nuts if you don't get into precious metals well that's that's exactly

[2:32:47.920 --> 2:32:52.400]  we took a little bacon and we took the little beans and we caught the bloody british in a town
[2:32:52.400 --> 2:32:57.840]  in new orleans we fired our guns and the british kept becoming there wasn't as many as there was
[2:32:57.840 --> 2:33:03.360]  a while ago we fired one small one and they began to run in from down to mississippi to the gulf of
[2:33:03.360 --> 2:33:10.880]  mexico we looked down the river and we see the british come and they must have been a hundred
[2:33:10.880 --> 2:33:16.240]  of beaten on the drum they stepped so high and they made the bugles ring we stood beside our cotton
[2:33:16.240 --> 2:33:21.760]  veils and didn't say a thing we fired our guns and the british kept becoming there wasn't as many
[2:33:21.760 --> 2:33:27.360]  as there was a while ago we fired one small one and they began to run in from down to mississippi to
[2:33:27.360 --> 2:33:35.280]  the gulf of mexico only increase it we could take them by surprise if we didn't fire muskies
[2:33:35.280 --> 2:33:40.240]  still we looked them in the eye we held our fire till we see their faces well then we opened up
[2:33:40.240 --> 2:33:45.360]  the squirrel guns and merely gave them well we fired our guns we're back live finishing with
[2:33:45.360 --> 2:33:49.440]  ten anderson and this is the next hour yes there was a while ago we're gonna have uh
[2:33:49.440 --> 2:33:53.680]  colonel craig robert so i really appreciate coming on because he was active duty marine
[2:33:53.680 --> 2:33:58.240]  corps five years in vietnam for several tours highly decorated and then of course is a best
[2:33:58.240 --> 2:34:03.680]  selling author uh on sniping and so many other issues i mean new york times bestseller
[2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:10.240]  millions of books in print uh he of course uh was on the tulsa police department swat team
[2:34:10.240 --> 2:34:15.600]  helicopter pilot uh and i'm just also i mean he's done it all and he also investigated the
[2:34:15.600 --> 2:34:19.840]  oklahoma city bombing helped expose that as an inside job so much of his investigations have
[2:34:19.840 --> 2:34:23.920]  now been mainstream news about the southern poverty law center basically running the white
[2:34:23.920 --> 2:34:29.120]  supremacist compound i mean running it forget infiltrating running the thing as they always do
[2:34:29.120 --> 2:34:35.040]  when we catch them so uh he started to talk about police because i've had the austin police chief
[2:34:35.040 --> 2:34:39.440]  on this show say he's not going along with the new world order i've had police come into stores
[2:34:39.440 --> 2:34:43.760]  when i'm in there and say look you know we're with you we know you're right about this stuff now
[2:34:43.760 --> 2:34:49.760]  uh i've got tons of contacts people around the country we have events you know like a 911 in new
[2:34:49.760 --> 2:34:54.000]  york police give us thumbs up the majority of them five years ago they would trip us and threaten
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:59.760]  to arrest us and so there's been a mass awakening uh and so i want to talk to him as a police officer
[2:34:59.760 --> 2:35:04.800]  as a sniper as a retired lieutenant colonel in the army somebody who worked in army intelligence
[2:35:04.800 --> 2:35:09.760]  on a whole host of issues as everything we said he's had a syndicated radio show
[2:35:09.760 --> 2:35:16.880]  and a previous incarnation as well uh i mean he's talked about so much of course he knew
[2:35:16.880 --> 2:35:21.840]  about the new world order before but then he had a a death experience he died on the operating table
[2:35:21.840 --> 2:35:26.640]  and then came back and just amazing the stuff that the colonel roberts has seen and and and
[2:35:26.640 --> 2:35:30.480]  a witness so he's with us and i want to move quick with him because there's so much to cover
[2:35:30.480 --> 2:35:35.920]  but before we go to colonel roberts and some of your calls finishing up ted i had that market
[2:35:35.920 --> 2:35:40.960]  expert on last hour and into this hour talking about how they're massively trying to manipulate
[2:35:41.680 --> 2:35:45.520]  pumping the stock market back up today because their economic terrorism didn't work yesterday
[2:35:45.520 --> 2:35:50.320]  with a trillion plus drop and they're also trying to hammer manipulate gold but again
[2:35:51.040 --> 2:35:55.600]  it's only going to shoot back up still up over a hundred bucks from what it was two weeks ago
[2:35:55.600 --> 2:36:00.800]  he went above 900 yesterday every time they push the beach ball into the water it only pops up
[2:36:00.800 --> 2:36:05.040]  with that much more fury so you've made another big buy of gold and silver so you can translate
[2:36:05.040 --> 2:36:11.360]  these discounts to people folks uses as a buying opportunity don't wait any longer with your paper
[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:17.920]  in these banks it is not safe the annuities are not insured ted yeah you bet it's going on right
[2:36:17.920 --> 2:36:23.280]  now though the banks are trying to prop the market up the precious metals it's that's like they're
[2:36:23.280 --> 2:36:27.280]  their vital enemy you know they need to push it down and they need to keep people in the paper
[2:36:27.280 --> 2:36:32.400]  but it's not working like you said there's just simply they're not enough money there's not enough
[2:36:32.400 --> 2:36:37.760]  gold and silver out there to manipulate like that and that's why we see that $80 increase just boom
[2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:43.120]  just like that when the uh when the banks started failing last time and now we have the same situation
[2:36:43.120 --> 2:36:49.920]  going on right now mccain and and uh and uh president bush and all these you know dignitaries
[2:36:49.920 --> 2:36:54.080]  are trying to tell us that uh that we need to stick all this money into these companies it's
[2:36:54.080 --> 2:36:59.360]  that's the wrong thing to do all the way around and everybody knows it and they the constituents
[2:36:59.360 --> 2:37:03.360]  of all these congressmen are getting hurt and they we better keep calling them absolutely
[2:37:03.360 --> 2:37:07.520]  folks should use this opportunity that we can't control things fully what's happening tell them
[2:37:07.520 --> 2:37:14.000]  we don't want the the the the the the scam we don't want total liability protection and and
[2:37:14.720 --> 2:37:19.280]  all of this to be given to these crooks do that but also protect yourself ted give them briefly
[2:37:19.280 --> 2:37:25.440]  the gold offer and silver offer today again uh british sovereigns you can't beat it it's 241

[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:32.560]  colonel craig roberts you want to uh take what's happening with the economy first we talked about
[2:38:32.560 --> 2:38:37.280]  years ago the globalist for engineering for control they're proposing a world banking government
[2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:42.560]  run by them after they engineered it as the new savior at all of this uh you want to talk about
[2:38:42.560 --> 2:38:47.920]  the police and military north com announcing that they are going to engage in domestic operations
[2:38:47.920 --> 2:38:52.560]  for civil unrest with regular army brigades everything we warn people about the federal
[2:38:52.560 --> 2:38:56.160]  police force i mean what do you want to tackle first well let's hit the economy first and get
[2:38:56.160 --> 2:39:00.480]  that out of the way alex it's good to have you here my friend yeah i'll break that down okay
[2:39:00.480 --> 2:39:05.600]  you know we talked about this a long time ago if you look at this uh differently you have to
[2:39:05.600 --> 2:39:10.000]  understand there is no money in a stock market the stock market doesn't have a dime the money is
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:14.480]  either in the corporations or in the shares of those corporations that you and i own a stock
[2:39:14.480 --> 2:39:19.520]  holders and it's when we go in and buy and sell it creates situations where people look at that
[2:39:19.520 --> 2:39:23.040]  and they go you know what i better get out of this this looks really bad and they panic and
[2:39:23.040 --> 2:39:26.640]  they start dumping stocks and it drives the stock market down and so on and so forth and when you
[2:39:26.640 --> 2:39:31.440]  do when you go in and you start tearing out the economic base of uh these banks and loan companies
[2:39:31.440 --> 2:39:36.240]  and these mortgage things uh that that only throws you know gas on the fire and then we get we end up
[2:39:36.240 --> 2:39:39.760]  with the situation we've got now well that's looking at it from one door but let's walk around
[2:39:39.760 --> 2:39:43.040]  the other side of the house and open the other door and look in and so it's really going on
[2:39:43.040 --> 2:39:48.160]  uh from a different view that uh no one seems to be discussing right now i look at it at a military
[2:39:48.160 --> 2:39:54.000]  aspect and the military aspect is if you're going to destroy a country there's several things you
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:58.080]  can do several things you have to do you can't just march in with troops and start shooting
[2:39:58.080 --> 2:40:02.640]  that's not going to work if the country has the will to fight you're going to lose you have to
[2:40:02.640 --> 2:40:09.040]  destroy the will of that country to fight you have to destroy uh the motivation for people in
[2:40:09.040 --> 2:40:14.000]  that country to do anything you have to take away uh the reconnaissance you have to take away their
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:20.080]  eyes by using the media to to tell them uh don't worry about anything sit on the couch open another
[2:40:20.080 --> 2:40:23.920]  six pack and watch the ball game shut up stay out of the way the government will take care of you
[2:40:23.920 --> 2:40:28.240]  and so people to take their antenna down they fold up the radar set and put it away
[2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:31.920]  and then they sit there and let this this this sort of things happen you'd have to destroy the
[2:40:31.920 --> 2:40:37.120]  morale of a country uh a country you have to destroy destroy the morals of a country you have to
[2:40:37.120 --> 2:40:42.640]  create a hopeless situation to where the people won't rally uh around uh anything central or
[2:40:42.640 --> 2:40:49.680]  anything big and then you have to cut off the logistics to that country uh by moving the industrial
[2:40:49.680 --> 2:40:54.000]  base away from that country move it out of the country send it overseas send the jobs overseas
[2:40:54.560 --> 2:40:58.160]  you have to dump down the education of the children so as they get older they don't see
[2:40:58.160 --> 2:41:02.320]  that there's anything going wrong and that the government is always right then you have to
[2:41:02.320 --> 2:41:06.560]  remove the barriers tear down the walls and open the borders to allow anybody to come in
[2:41:06.560 --> 2:41:12.000]  that wants to come in and bring all the crime all the drugs anything else they want to to reinforce
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:16.720]  your total battle plan and that weighs down the states and bankrupts them and and yeah it
[2:41:16.720 --> 2:41:21.920]  did all of this stuff creates a situation where the government has to use money out of your pocket
[2:41:21.920 --> 2:41:25.840]  to solve the solve the problem it's filled with galeon effect all over again so all of these
[2:41:25.840 --> 2:41:31.200]  things attack us at once we don't know which window of the cabin to run to shoot out of
[2:41:31.200 --> 2:41:34.880]  we're sitting here going man i don't know what to do maybe ought to just buy a boat and go to
[2:41:34.880 --> 2:41:39.120]  Costa Rica uh maybe ought to just get a whole bunch of food and block all my doors and stay
[2:41:39.120 --> 2:41:43.760]  here till this thing blows over maybe ought to just plant a garden you know and then we start
[2:41:43.760 --> 2:41:47.920]  studying uh especially the baby boomer generation they're looking at this uh they've already been
[2:41:47.920 --> 2:41:51.120]  through some of this stuff before and they're looking at this stuff now in their 60s and 70s
[2:41:51.120 --> 2:41:55.840]  going my retirement's going out the window i don't even i can't get a job i'm too old to do that i
[2:41:55.840 --> 2:42:00.560]  can't support myself and my family how am i going to survive and and and if the government collapses
[2:42:00.560 --> 2:42:04.240]  if i've got a government pension or social security i'm not even going to get that so now
[2:42:04.240 --> 2:42:11.040]  what do i do so we end up being europe in 1943 when countries are being invaded and the refugees
[2:42:11.040 --> 2:42:18.080]  are beginning to leave it's that same mental aspect of of of population panic and that's all
[2:42:18.080 --> 2:42:23.120]  programmed this stuff does not happen by accident this stuff happens because it's set up years and
[2:42:23.120 --> 2:42:27.840]  years in advance as part of a total plan to do something and one of the things they've failed
[2:42:27.840 --> 2:42:32.880]  at so far they haven't completely failed but they've partially failed you can't uh turn the peasants
[2:42:32.880 --> 2:42:38.000]  into slaves and let you disarm them well they've been the the clint administration spent eight years
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:41.440]  trying to reduce our firepower they couldn't totally disarm us on the second amendment but they
[2:42:41.440 --> 2:42:45.680]  tried to reduce our firepower said you know you can only have a magazine that's 10 rounds or less
[2:42:45.680 --> 2:42:50.240]  you can't have this on your gun it can't be ugly and black and blah blah blah but that only raised
[2:42:50.240 --> 2:42:55.760]  alarm flags so people armed up even more it backfired it backfired so big they didn't realize
[2:42:55.760 --> 2:43:00.000]  what they had done they pushed the wrong kind of people they had underestimated the the uh
[2:43:00.000 --> 2:43:05.920]  the basic mainstream uh american mentality that's in bread and it's all the way from the pilgrims up
[2:43:05.920 --> 2:43:09.520]  and that is people ran down they started buying up every piece of ammunition they could get they
[2:43:09.520 --> 2:43:14.640]  bought every gun they could afford uh they started uh they they they did panic buying because they
[2:43:14.640 --> 2:43:19.120]  didn't want to instead of sitting there uh like uh the australians and the canadiens and the brits
[2:43:19.120 --> 2:43:23.120]  and roll over and say here's my guns you can roll over them with a street roller people bought more
[2:43:23.120 --> 2:43:27.520]  guns and they hid them i mean they probably sold more pvc pipe and because in the first 200 years
[2:43:27.520 --> 2:43:34.480]  of this country it was a barbaric frontier warfare nation and only the strong could survive and so
[2:43:34.480 --> 2:43:39.680]  even if we're fat dumb and happy those original genetics and those original information was
[2:43:39.680 --> 2:43:44.160]  carried on well absolutely i mean you can find examples throughout american history when there
[2:43:44.160 --> 2:43:49.120]  wasn't really a lot going on but all of a sudden everybody just rallied around the situation uh
[2:43:49.120 --> 2:43:54.400]  you're sitting right there next to the alamo uh you know the alamo was it was a uh a classic
[2:43:54.400 --> 2:43:59.120]  example of people rallying and you know with with single shot muskets holding off an entire army
[2:43:59.120 --> 2:44:05.120]  of well trained uh soldiers you've got uh uh you've got other situations that cropped up
[2:44:05.120 --> 2:44:09.600]  through american history where people just did within a moment's notice all of a sudden became
[2:44:09.600 --> 2:44:14.560]  a militia or all of a sudden became an army in their own right and were able to defeat superior
[2:44:14.560 --> 2:44:21.840]  odds um uh with motivation and courage and and just plain uh you know guts and so we still have
[2:44:21.840 --> 2:44:26.480]  that in us today we we still look back at our ancestors and see what they did you know i mean
[2:44:26.480 --> 2:44:30.720]  i look at stuff like the civil war and on both sides of the civil war we could not fight that
[2:44:30.720 --> 2:44:35.520]  war today our army alex could not fight the civil war today with the conditions they went
[2:44:35.520 --> 2:44:40.080]  through with the equipment they had they're not tough enough i know i was in it long enough
[2:44:40.080 --> 2:44:45.920]  you look at the battle of gettysburg alone in july uh uh uh uh uh it was hot and the union army
[2:44:45.920 --> 2:44:49.520]  made contact with the confederate army who had been forging up north and was coming back south
[2:44:49.520 --> 2:44:55.360]  at gettysburg they made contact with the lead elements and they had 30 miles of troops strung
[2:44:55.360 --> 2:45:02.800]  out down the road with hot full full sleeve wool uniforms in the middle of july carrying packs
[2:45:02.800 --> 2:45:08.400]  full of all their gear big heavy muskets bayonets cantines a whole bit and ordered them to run
[2:45:08.400 --> 2:45:13.200]  to the battle and these people ran for miles a lot of them had to dump their packs and the
[2:45:13.200 --> 2:45:17.040]  farmers stole them so they didn't have food when they got there but they the bottom line was
[2:45:17.040 --> 2:45:20.080]  they ran all the way to the battle and then they fought the battle when they got there
[2:45:20.080 --> 2:45:23.680]  our guys would have dropped out along the road today i hate to say that but but that we're just
[2:45:23.680 --> 2:45:28.640]  not geared uh for that we're geared more to jump on the humvee jump on the tank you know right as
[2:45:28.640 --> 2:45:33.360]  far as we can get on the helicopter then fight door to door but not do the long infantry type
[2:45:33.360 --> 2:45:39.600]  battles that they had in those days that can change out of necessity but today it's it's a
[2:45:39.600 --> 2:45:43.680]  totally different scenario even though we look back and we said they did it we can do it too
[2:45:43.680 --> 2:45:48.960]  we're not ready to do it but we could do it if we had to now when we take all of these things
[2:45:48.960 --> 2:45:52.160]  well if they've really done here here's what the new world order pukes have really done
[2:45:52.960 --> 2:45:58.800]  they have created an enemy at the gate and they they've and now they're starting to open the door
[2:45:58.800 --> 2:46:03.280]  to let the enemy in and if you don't have a problem of course you're not going to have a solution
[2:46:03.280 --> 2:46:10.000]  well the solution is to destroy the economy more to do these these massive bailouts to spend more
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:15.440]  money look how much money they spent on the war on drugs and all it's done is got the drug
[2:46:15.440 --> 2:46:19.360]  importation has gotten more and more every year look how much they spent on the border and it's
[2:46:19.360 --> 2:46:25.600]  done and it's doing less every year than it ever did before it doesn't matter what it is they spend
[2:46:25.600 --> 2:46:31.680]  money but it doesn't do any good because it's not being spent in the right places and then led by
[2:46:31.680 --> 2:46:35.840]  the right people and supervised by the right people so basically what it is it's creating
[2:46:35.840 --> 2:46:42.240]  more of a debt and the debt is one thing and as the Rothschild said back in Europe in 1773
[2:46:42.240 --> 2:46:48.800]  they said debt is power I care not who wins on either side of a conflict if I loan money to
[2:46:48.800 --> 2:46:55.040]  both sides in the end that they're both in my debt and I control them on both sides and that's
[2:46:55.040 --> 2:46:59.120]  what the Rothschild plan was back then and it still works today and so let's talk about what
[2:46:59.120 --> 2:47:04.080]  they're planning to do now and in the wildcard because the police and military look at Ron Paul
[2:47:04.080 --> 2:47:10.480]  getting 73 percent of all the republican donations and outweighing even obama's donation from the
[2:47:10.480 --> 2:47:16.960]  military that sends the signal that the military is with the people well yeah the military is by
[2:47:16.960 --> 2:47:21.920]  and large uh you know you're not gonna have it and this is they there's a there's a plan a and a
[2:47:21.920 --> 2:47:28.400]  plan b at work here the plan a is uh the morons behind this thing uh sitting their little ivory
[2:47:28.400 --> 2:47:33.120]  towers and their little you know oak panel rooms and they come up with all these grandiose plans
[2:47:33.120 --> 2:47:38.960]  and they base everything on their good old boy tie and uh their bank account and who they know and
[2:47:38.960 --> 2:47:43.360]  so on and so forth but they really don't know what's going on beyond the alliganties and they
[2:47:43.360 --> 2:47:47.200]  don't see that they don't take anything as a genuine threat you know when I testified before
[2:47:47.200 --> 2:47:53.520]  congress and on april 5th of 1995 I mentioned to those guys I said look I said all the second
[2:47:53.520 --> 2:47:58.800]  amendment stuff you guys are pulling what it's doing is it's making a lot of people real nervous
[2:47:58.800 --> 2:48:02.560]  out in the you know the main part of the rest of the country in flyover land and they're actually
[2:48:02.560 --> 2:48:07.440]  forming militias to resist the government to come in and take it take away their guns and they looked
[2:48:07.440 --> 2:48:11.760]  at me and said there's no such thing as any militias out there this is in 1995 that's how
[2:48:11.760 --> 2:48:17.200]  insulated these people are so when they they don't they don't realize they don't they don't
[2:48:17.200 --> 2:48:21.920]  believe even if they get the intelligence reports that that there's a huge movement in this country
[2:48:21.920 --> 2:48:26.560]  of sympathy in a certain direction they don't believe it they they they believe the new york
[2:48:26.560 --> 2:48:31.360]  times poll they believe uh uh cnn polls that you know that's what they look at they don't listen to
[2:48:31.360 --> 2:48:38.960]  you and me and so what's happening is uh they don't understand that the military has swung more
[2:48:38.960 --> 2:48:45.760]  and more and more to the right and conservatives and patriotic but more and more distrustful
[2:48:45.760 --> 2:48:50.640]  of the government and it was the same way when I was in vietnam you know I would I would fight for
[2:48:50.640 --> 2:48:55.040]  my country and I would fight for the guys that I was with but I hated lbj and I hated everything
[2:48:55.040 --> 2:49:00.560]  he stood for so when I got home I was totally opposite of what the in-place government wanted
[2:49:00.560 --> 2:49:04.880]  and at that so the military and police are buying that bush was a fake right wing and it was all
[2:49:04.880 --> 2:49:08.880]  staged and that's what the intel i'm getting what are you hearing from your military context in your
[2:49:08.880 --> 2:49:14.480]  police context well on the military side of the house uh there's more and more guys who are just
[2:49:14.480 --> 2:49:19.200]  just saying you know uh it looks like there's going to be a situation at home or we're going
[2:49:19.200 --> 2:49:24.400]  to have to do something to survive this thing and our our loyalties are going to be to our
[2:49:24.400 --> 2:49:30.560]  families and our communities uh it doesn't matter you can take you can take the uh uh you know a
[2:49:30.560 --> 2:49:36.000]  brigade from the 82nd airborne and you can send them to you know some town in the united states and
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:42.640]  say maintain order they'll maintain order but when you tell them these are the enemies of the of
[2:49:42.640 --> 2:49:47.440]  the nation and anybody that resists shoot them guess what you're going to have problems I wouldn't
[2:49:47.440 --> 2:49:51.840]  want to be the officer that gave that order because I might see a bunch of uh m4s turned around in my
[2:49:51.840 --> 2:49:57.120]  direction so I don't think that plan is going to work the idiots in Washington don't realize that
[2:49:57.120 --> 2:50:02.000]  the idiots in New York City at the UN don't realize that they think they can make that work here's
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:06.480]  the other side of that coin they have a backup plan and just like we talked about before when
[2:50:06.480 --> 2:50:11.760]  general Barry McAfrey gave the graduation speech to a cascue class in in Fort Leavenworth Kansas
[2:50:11.760 --> 2:50:16.640]  several years ago he used the term and he's a member of the council on foreign relations stay
[2:50:16.640 --> 2:50:20.400]  there let's hear about their backup plan and how this is going to flesh out and then talk about
[2:50:20.400 --> 2:50:24.720]  the police because of course you've been a police officer swat team guy helicopter pilot in the
[2:50:24.720 --> 2:50:29.840]  police department done a lot of detective work and of course uh in the army and intelligence before
[2:50:29.840 --> 2:50:35.280]  that in the Marines so you know all these people will talk about it cameras are everywhere above
[2:50:35.280 --> 2:50:40.800]  stoplights on toll booths and scanning the freeways just waiting to snap a photo of your license plate
[2:50:40.800 --> 2:50:47.360]  only to slam you with ridiculous fines in California red light tickets are as high as $400 spray your
[2:50:47.360 --> 2:50:52.160]  plate is a spray on photoblocker that protects against all types of cameras spray your plate

[2:54:05.840 --> 2:54:06.720]  okay
[2:54:06.720 --> 2:54:10.080]  colonel craig roberts is our guest we're getting into the military and police
[2:54:10.880 --> 2:54:15.200]  everything you see all these people like colonel roberts himself going back over a decade ago with
[2:54:15.200 --> 2:54:19.840]  a syndicated talk show myself countless others warned everybody laid out what was going to happen
[2:54:19.840 --> 2:54:24.640]  people laughed at us the adl and southern probably lost center lied and how to demonize
[2:54:24.640 --> 2:54:30.800]  people that warned about it the media tried to do it but now it's become mainstream now it's become
[2:54:31.840 --> 2:54:37.840]  just massively mainstream and the public is now learning about it and and our credibility is
[2:54:37.840 --> 2:54:43.760]  shot up continue colonel roberts okay now we were talking about what plan b was uh if our american
[2:54:43.760 --> 2:54:49.280]  military doesn't go to uh beyond a certain point and enforce in any type of martial law that may
[2:54:49.280 --> 2:54:56.560]  be declared um we had uh this general barry mcgaffrey who was uh at that time i think he was commander
[2:54:56.560 --> 2:55:04.800]  south common he he was up uh at the uh cascue uh graduation of officers in fort leavenworth
[2:55:04.800 --> 2:55:09.120]  kansas the that's a course you take before you to go to the command general staff college and
[2:55:09.120 --> 2:55:13.360]  during his speech he said that should because of the build down of american armed forces
[2:55:13.360 --> 2:55:21.600]  uh should we be um committed to any two fronts overseas and he didn't say that korea was in front
[2:55:21.600 --> 2:55:26.080]  but we're already committed in south korea now we're committed in iraq and now we're committed
[2:55:26.080 --> 2:55:32.960]  in afghanistan so there's actually three fronts and he said that if this should happen then if we
[2:55:32.960 --> 2:55:39.600]  had an emergency situation uh in the united states that they required military intervention that we
[2:55:39.600 --> 2:55:48.560]  would be uh required or have to call upon foreign assets to patrol our streets now foreign assets
[2:55:48.560 --> 2:55:52.880]  obviously are foreign troops now we take this and we throw one other thing into the mix and that's
[2:55:52.880 --> 2:55:56.720]  the fact that the clintons destroyed the military when they were in and they would they wore out what
[2:55:56.720 --> 2:56:01.840]  was what was left after desert storm they took away the money for maintenance of all of our
[2:56:01.840 --> 2:56:06.960]  equipment airplanes and ships and then they closed down military bases right and left and then
[2:56:06.960 --> 2:56:14.320]  bush jr comes along and we end up uh committed in iran in iraq in south korea and other places
[2:56:14.320 --> 2:56:18.800]  around the world uh to where we stretched the military so thin now we had we've had to use
[2:56:18.800 --> 2:56:24.160]  up the army reserve the air force reserve the army national guard and so on we're wearing up
[2:56:24.160 --> 2:56:28.800]  the we're wearing out the troops that normally would be here is the last resort and they're
[2:56:28.800 --> 2:56:33.520]  being deployed over and over overseas so there's no one at home to watch the chickens with that
[2:56:33.520 --> 2:56:37.920]  being the case they're now they're wanting to bring army brigades back in case of a civil
[2:56:37.920 --> 2:56:42.800]  civil uh disturbance civil unrest whatever riding in the streets at the election you know we don't
[2:56:42.800 --> 2:56:48.160]  know what's going to happen um to use them in case just like they had to use the 82nd airborne in
[2:56:48.160 --> 2:56:54.960]  washington dc back in the 60s uh if that uh if they if they don't do whatever has to be done in
[2:56:54.960 --> 2:56:59.200]  other words if people take up arms for whatever reason and they don't do that then they're going
[2:56:59.200 --> 2:57:03.120]  to call upon these foreign assets and we're going to end up with blue helmets creating the target
[2:57:03.120 --> 2:57:07.520]  rich environment out here for everybody that's got a gun i think that's where this thing's going
[2:57:07.520 --> 2:57:11.840]  i think it's been set up for a long time uh it's not going to surprise me if that happens and i know
[2:57:11.840 --> 2:57:19.600]  the police and the military uh both are looking at this as an excuse is a very realistic possibility
[2:57:19.600 --> 2:57:23.440]  well let's talk about that but look at the conditioning u n troops of the last decade
[2:57:23.440 --> 2:57:28.960]  helping with forest fires then mexican troops helping in new orleans uh dutch troops dutch
[2:57:28.960 --> 2:57:36.400]  a wax dutch f16s uh used to patrol the us like we didn't have the forces uh our name demonized
[2:57:36.400 --> 2:57:41.360]  worldwide now what earlier this year without congress's approval north com signs a deal with
[2:57:41.360 --> 2:57:47.600]  mexico and canada to quote use their troops here during domestic disturbances or terror attacks uh
[2:57:47.600 --> 2:57:54.880]  so this is all being prepared and we're going into global receivership and that is plan b which
[2:57:54.880 --> 2:57:59.920]  will fail as well uh and and listen the new order failed a big test they thought they could get their
[2:57:59.920 --> 2:58:06.400]  bailout yesterday that failed so they plunged the market 1 trillion 200 billion uh it's it's just

[3:00:54.720 --> 3:01:05.440]  really until ventura is on tomorrow but uh i will tell you this i was pitched by the same group a year
[3:01:05.440 --> 3:01:15.360]  ago to do you've seen that trailer online um i forget the name of the show they created a little mini
[3:01:15.360 --> 3:01:25.120]  pilot it was called um conspiracy nation and uh i'm gonna john google that alex jones conspiracy
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:32.080]  nation uh and later i want to play that little one minute trailer from that internal pilot they made
[3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:35.840]  but hey i'm glad i mean jesse ventura i've been thinking man this gotta be great with the tv show
[3:01:35.840 --> 3:01:41.440]  doing this i'm just glad that uh that is going on that that that did happen this is time warner is
[3:01:41.440 --> 3:01:45.680]  putting this out by the way they know that's where the quote market is and and and that goes what we
[3:01:45.680 --> 3:01:50.800]  were just saying colonel roberts that this is mainstream now the new old order mainline people
[3:01:50.800 --> 3:01:55.680]  know it was true newt know we're right people now know we told him the truth i don't see how the new
[3:01:55.680 --> 3:02:02.080]  old order is going to get away with this when even mainline tv is doing shows about it dot colonel
[3:02:02.080 --> 3:02:09.200]  roberts well you know it's it's absolutely incredible it's it's you know it's almost insulting
[3:02:10.080 --> 3:02:15.760]  that uh we have several things going on in the world if you get on the on the internet and you
[3:02:15.760 --> 3:02:19.920]  you look at new sources overseas and you see what's really going on in the world and you can start
[3:02:19.920 --> 3:02:24.560]  putting all these things together then you go back to our own new sources and it's all been censored
[3:02:24.560 --> 3:02:30.720]  out you know all the news it's fit to print according to them and so with the american public out here
[3:02:30.720 --> 3:02:37.120]  that only watches uh the three or four main main networks or listens to two or three places on radio
[3:02:37.120 --> 3:02:42.960]  they don't get the picture of what's going on so obviously if it's not in that two second blurb up
[3:02:42.960 --> 3:02:48.160]  there on tv it didn't happen and you go to talk to these people as you and i do and several in a lot
[3:02:48.160 --> 3:02:52.400]  of your listeners do we say look you know did you hear about this this is what's going down it's
[3:02:52.400 --> 3:02:57.200]  already happening look i said no that can't be it couldn't happen here couldn't happen in this country
[3:02:57.200 --> 3:03:02.080]  i don't know how many times i've heard that it can't happen in this country and yet it's been
[3:03:02.080 --> 3:03:07.600]  happening incrementally for a long time now that's called fabian socialism fabian socialism is is you
[3:03:07.600 --> 3:03:13.360]  take it a a a society or a country one little step at a time you don't go kicking the door in and
[3:03:13.360 --> 3:03:16.960]  rush in with all your guns and shoot the place up and that's what they've been doing it they've been
[3:03:16.960 --> 3:03:21.440]  doing it in the legislature they've been doing it in the un and they've been doing it on the local
[3:03:21.440 --> 3:03:26.640]  level with a lot of your cities getting away with things that are totally uh unconstitutional
[3:03:26.640 --> 3:03:30.960]  so just taking private property away from somebody so they can build a a hotel on it because it
[3:03:30.960 --> 3:03:35.840]  generates more property tax that sort of thing and then turning around in our courts back up the
[3:03:35.840 --> 3:03:41.440]  illegal operations of your local governments so we've got a court renegade system out there
[3:03:41.440 --> 3:03:46.240]  that's gone amok we've got a supreme court that is a toss up it's a roulette wheel you never know
[3:03:46.240 --> 3:03:50.800]  where that thing is going to land we've got a federal government right now made up of nothing
[3:03:50.800 --> 3:03:56.800]  but special interest groups like this giant uh uh uh portuguese man of war that has all
[3:03:56.800 --> 3:04:02.320]  these different tentacles of different lengths that that hang down um and they all have their
[3:04:02.320 --> 3:04:08.240]  own their own agendas and they're all using the same power of our money against us and it's all
[3:04:08.240 --> 3:04:15.520]  coming home to roost as we speak all right stay there stay there we're going to come back to

[3:08:00.800 --> 3:08:05.200]  got two big guests coming up tomorrow one of them just even tour about the new tv show he's working
[3:08:05.200 --> 3:08:10.400]  on there's a lot more than just that but i'm just going to keep my mouth shut um
[3:08:13.280 --> 3:08:17.280]  but uh let's go back to colonel craig roberts talk about the really serious issues of the
[3:08:17.280 --> 3:08:24.400]  the criminal banking system trying to bankrupt the united states we're getting into martial law
[3:08:24.400 --> 3:08:28.080]  they want to use the military and police they've tried to train them they've got the microwave
[3:08:28.080 --> 3:08:31.760]  guns the sound cannons they've got a certain percentage it'll do it but a lot of them are
[3:08:31.760 --> 3:08:36.880]  waking up now and so the federal government's openly said we will use foreigners but not just
[3:08:36.880 --> 3:08:41.920]  mexican canadian un troops as they've stated publicly we've given the evidence of that earlier
[3:08:41.920 --> 3:08:45.200]  now but i want to recap that colonel roberts because a lot of folks just now joined us
[3:08:45.200 --> 3:08:50.320]  what about the fact that they're hiring all these illegal aliens for the army what about the fact
[3:08:50.320 --> 3:08:55.200]  they're hiring aggravated felons for the military i mean that's all admitted so they're also doing
[3:08:55.200 --> 3:09:02.480]  what stalin did there uh break all that down for us when you have to resort to uh taking people
[3:09:03.200 --> 3:09:09.920]  uh who are uh you know known criminals have felony records and if you have to take uh people who
[3:09:09.920 --> 3:09:13.920]  aren't even americans that they know that they come across the border illegally and you end up
[3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:17.520]  putting them in the military then that that's an indicator you've got a serious problem with
[3:09:17.520 --> 3:09:22.240]  your retention and your with your strength um we do you know during the vietnam war they had to
[3:09:22.240 --> 3:09:27.200]  resort to the draft uh and they also we had canadiens that came across and joined the marines and
[3:09:27.200 --> 3:09:32.880]  served with us with great distinction uh we had but when i went to uh when i went to boot camp
[3:09:32.880 --> 3:09:37.680]  from los angeles um i was on a greyhound bus where there was three of us i think that did
[3:09:37.680 --> 3:09:42.080]  not have what was known as a choice and the choice was uh from a judge that you're going to go to
[3:09:42.080 --> 3:09:46.320]  the state penitentiary at chino or you're going to join the marine corps the judge gave these guys
[3:09:46.320 --> 3:09:50.400]  and they they elected joining the marine corps most of them east l.a street gang type guys
[3:09:50.400 --> 3:09:53.280]  and they ended up joining the marine corps and going to boot camp so the prisoners had already
[3:09:53.280 --> 3:09:58.800]  been sent um we call it the dirty dozen mindset you go to the prison you give these guys a chance
[3:09:58.800 --> 3:10:03.520]  to get out of prison to go die for their country type deal well when we start doing that that's an
[3:10:03.520 --> 3:10:10.400]  indicator that uh uh hey we don't have enough of our own people enlisting or re-enlisting to
[3:10:10.400 --> 3:10:15.360]  maintain the the troop levels we want or be there's something else afoot and that that kind of
[3:10:15.360 --> 3:10:20.880]  stinks and that could be a situation where we need to get people in that oh us more than they
[3:10:20.880 --> 3:10:25.360]  owe anybody else so they're going to do what we tell them to do no matter what and those are the
[3:10:25.360 --> 3:10:29.600]  ones i would be afraid of those are the ones who might be ordered to shoot americans at a roadblock
[3:10:29.600 --> 3:10:34.000]  and do so um what have they got to lose they're trying to get citizenship they're trying to get
[3:10:34.000 --> 3:10:37.680]  benefits they're trying to get something else uh they're trying to stay out of prison whatever
[3:10:37.680 --> 3:10:42.320]  it is they would would would go along with that mindset now that's that's a minority of people
[3:10:42.320 --> 3:10:47.280]  that in the military right now but you never know what could happen in the future on the police side
[3:10:47.280 --> 3:10:55.600]  of the house i've talked to police officers from california to tennessee um and with the the mindset
[3:10:55.600 --> 3:11:01.040]  basically is uh the officers that are about 35 years old and older are seeing all of this happen
[3:11:01.040 --> 3:11:05.040]  and understanding what's going on and getting on board and learning more and educating themselves
[3:11:05.040 --> 3:11:10.560]  and talking to other people and getting more concerned where those below 35 especially those
[3:11:10.560 --> 3:11:14.800]  in their 20s they're not quite there yet they're the babes in the woods they're still going along
[3:11:14.800 --> 3:11:20.480]  we get with the yes or yes or three bags full and um uh they they're still in what we call the
[3:11:20.480 --> 3:11:24.800]  wide irp syndrome you know i got a badge and a gun all enforced the law and obey orders and
[3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:30.000]  and uh that sort of thing and their scope hasn't focused out yet to see what's really going on
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:34.240]  in the world so i kind of take those guys with a grain of salt because they haven't matured yet
[3:11:34.240 --> 3:11:38.320]  into the politics outside of their own police department or outside of their own city or or
[3:11:38.320 --> 3:11:43.360]  county uh another problem that i've seen going on though that that's worried me and we've talked
[3:11:43.360 --> 3:11:49.040]  about this one before is cross-deputization now cross-deputization is when you have a state
[3:11:49.600 --> 3:11:56.320]  um uh no in a county and a city and a federal government and the tribal police all become
[3:11:56.320 --> 3:12:01.520]  deputized in their their various organizations to where they can enforce any law they want any
[3:12:01.520 --> 3:12:05.520]  place they go and it's the same as the guy that has jurisdiction there in other words it's a
[3:12:05.520 --> 3:12:11.520]  multi jurisdictional situation and uh it's it's going to end up uh at the point where
[3:12:11.520 --> 3:12:17.120]  we're going to have a federal police force a uniformed federal police force even though it may
[3:12:17.120 --> 3:12:22.160]  say in california highway patrol or the uh houston police department or something like
[3:12:22.160 --> 3:12:26.560]  that on the guy's shoulder he'll have another patch or he'll have another i d card that will
[3:12:26.560 --> 3:12:32.080]  show him that he can be a federal marshal or a uh well that's already happening i mean that's
[3:12:32.080 --> 3:12:37.040]  already going on and it's federalized radios they put in these local regional command centers
[3:12:37.040 --> 3:12:41.840]  with the national guard right next door and everything fused in together well and they're
[3:12:41.840 --> 3:12:45.600]  pulling it all together under the guys of homeland security because they couldn't make it work under
[3:12:45.600 --> 3:12:50.320]  fema like they wanted to fema was a disaster so now they're pulling it together under homeland
[3:12:50.320 --> 3:12:56.480]  security and uh you know i did it just it just makes me ill to think that that you've got the same
[3:12:56.480 --> 3:13:01.680]  people doing the same thing that would represent my police department and tsa as far as i'm i'm
[3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:07.920]  concerned tsa is a total disaster that's i call them the airport nazis um uh it's it's another
[3:13:07.920 --> 3:13:12.480]  it's another situation of overreaction to something by the federal government but in the end they
[3:13:12.480 --> 3:13:18.160]  created bureaucracy with police powers that is totally uh terrifying you i mean you lose when
[3:13:18.160 --> 3:13:22.240]  you walk into an airport today for instance you lose the first amendment you lose the second
[3:13:22.240 --> 3:13:26.640]  amendment you lose the fifth amendment you lose everything when you walk into that airport you
[3:13:26.640 --> 3:13:31.840]  can't say anything you can't have a bad look on your face or you'll get profiled uh you can't
[3:13:31.840 --> 3:13:35.920]  complain about anything now they're putting brain scanners on just in the airports but on the streets
[3:13:36.480 --> 3:13:40.320]  and they and they make you walk through systems that scan your neck and body those are now going
[3:13:40.320 --> 3:13:45.760]  on the streets not just airports well and on top of that you know we're going we're going the same
[3:13:45.760 --> 3:13:51.520]  direction as they did in england and uk and i just read this morning as a matter of fact
[3:13:51.520 --> 3:13:57.600]  about uh the crime rate in the in the uk especially in london has skyrocketed since the
[3:13:57.600 --> 3:14:02.720]  british public has basically become disarmed but the their excuse was well we think we've
[3:14:02.720 --> 3:14:07.440]  got some good video imagery of the murderers there's three of them we think we've got some
[3:14:07.440 --> 3:14:12.160]  good video imagery of them well whoop-de-doo that doesn't put them in jail and it didn't save the
[3:14:12.160 --> 3:14:17.600]  guy's life it's lying there bleeding in the street um but the cameras are in england are supposed to
[3:14:17.600 --> 3:14:21.280]  solve everything so what are we doing we're following this down the same direction we're
[3:14:21.280 --> 3:14:26.240]  putting cameras all over the place now i had a phone call the other day from somebody said hey
[3:14:26.240 --> 3:14:31.040]  in Tulsa, oklahoma we've got cameras on on the intersections of every major street now
[3:14:31.600 --> 3:14:36.080]  who owns those cameras what are they looking at and so i said well you know i never even thought
[3:14:36.080 --> 3:14:39.440]  about it but i'll check in it because i don't live in Tulsa anymore i moved out of there and moved
[3:14:39.440 --> 3:14:43.760]  to the country when it was uh when i thought it was a good time to do so but i started making
[3:14:43.760 --> 3:14:47.280]  some phone calls i call the police department they didn't know they're not our cameras they
[3:14:47.280 --> 3:14:53.200]  belong to the uh department of transportation or the city or somebody so i call the city
[3:14:53.200 --> 3:14:57.840]  street department no they're not ours i call all around finally uh everybody that that
[3:14:57.840 --> 3:15:01.840]  seemed to know said well we think their department of transportation cameras now well what are they
[3:15:01.840 --> 3:15:07.280]  doing on our uh traffic lights and what are they looking for what are they looking at what are they
[3:15:07.280 --> 3:15:12.320]  for well no one could answer that question so and i guess if you go up to the state capital
[3:15:12.320 --> 3:15:16.480]  and find whoever's responsible you can get an answer but we're seeing this all over the
[3:15:16.480 --> 3:15:20.400]  country right now well what does it do it makes citizens paranoid i've heard people say well you
[3:15:20.400 --> 3:15:23.840]  know when it comes down to it i'll just take my shotgun out there and start shooting those cameras
[3:15:23.840 --> 3:15:28.880]  off the off the tops of the poles well when people start thinking about that you know we've got
[3:15:28.880 --> 3:15:32.400]  some problems and these are the average people these aren't people that belong to a militia these
[3:15:32.400 --> 3:15:36.000]  aren't people who would normally go out and break the law they're just average people who have had
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:41.280]  enough they're fed up and they're tired of big brotherism and they really americans really hate
[3:15:41.280 --> 3:15:45.920]  people prime in our private business but it's getting worse all the time and i think it's a
[3:15:45.920 --> 3:15:49.520]  spring that sooner or later is going to be compressed to the point to where it flashes back
[3:15:49.520 --> 3:15:54.640]  and it's going to be a big surprise that's when uh they'll be federal government entities step in
[3:15:54.640 --> 3:15:59.360]  and say we have public unrest we've got to stop civil disturbances here these people can't get away
[3:15:59.360 --> 3:16:05.280]  with this or the boss they aren't you know coming totally backwards on that and uh that's when we're
[3:16:05.280 --> 3:16:13.120]  going to start seeing uh military type reaction to it to form a martial law well again the the elite
[3:16:13.120 --> 3:16:21.760]  running the planet are criminal they are out of control and they are they're using the police state
[3:16:21.760 --> 3:16:30.800]  to try to guard themselves uh from prosecution from their past crimes and they want to use a police
[3:16:30.800 --> 3:16:36.960]  state apparatus to further consolidate their control and we better get control of our local
[3:16:36.960 --> 3:16:40.480]  governments now we better educate our mayors and people now because a few years ago they wouldn't
[3:16:40.480 --> 3:16:44.800]  listen now they are listening i talked about the austin police chief you know uh i thought he was
[3:16:44.800 --> 3:16:48.480]  putting me on behind the scenes and on air saying he's a fan of the show and believes a lot of it
[3:16:48.480 --> 3:16:52.400]  but then i found out people that know him separately at parties and behind the scenes at
[3:16:52.400 --> 3:16:57.600]  tv stations and radio stations he's doing alex jones imitations and talking about me constantly
[3:16:57.600 --> 3:17:03.200]  so i guess he's waking up uh and i mean if i was a police chief and i knew about the stuff i would
[3:17:03.200 --> 3:17:07.280]  be thinking about it all the time i mean and i and i see that all over the country with police
[3:17:07.280 --> 3:17:11.200]  as much as i bash him for being violent in the constitution i think at the end of the day they
[3:17:11.200 --> 3:17:16.320]  realize that it is this country they owe allegiance to and the bad guys are in control of the government
[3:17:16.320 --> 3:17:21.840]  just like hitler was in control of germany well you know you know alex uh uh i'm an old ex files
[3:17:21.840 --> 3:17:26.080]  junkie i i really like that show but there was every once while they come up with a real jewel
[3:17:26.080 --> 3:17:30.240]  and one of the things that they said in there was trust no one i don't know if you ever watched it
[3:17:30.240 --> 3:17:35.840]  remember says trust no one i'll remember one of the deals well when it comes to chiefs of police
[3:17:35.840 --> 3:17:39.920]  that is the theme don't trust a single chief of police out there until you get to know him
[3:17:39.920 --> 3:17:45.120]  personally like you did with this guy uh oh i'm not even saying he's perfect i didn't trust him
[3:17:45.120 --> 3:17:48.960]  to all heard behind the scenes stuff the point is is that they're waking up they're paying attention
[3:17:48.960 --> 3:17:53.360]  well yeah that one way or the other they're getting on board one way or the other uh slowly but surely
[3:17:53.360 --> 3:17:56.480]  but you've got to understand and that and i'm talking when i say i mean i'm playing maybe getting
[3:17:56.480 --> 3:18:01.120]  on board because they've they've been told to be friendly well i've told you here's here's the way
[3:18:01.120 --> 3:18:07.200]  it works there are chiefs of police organizations out there there's the major chiefs association
[3:18:07.200 --> 3:18:11.280]  there's the national chiefs association there's several others that they belong to and they're
[3:18:11.280 --> 3:18:14.480]  they're like clubs and they all share stuff and they all come under different federal grant
[3:18:14.480 --> 3:18:20.160]  monies and sort of sort so on so forth and what they do is they get together and and and most
[3:18:20.160 --> 3:18:25.440]  most police chiefs of any major city is going to be a political appointee he's going to be under
[3:18:25.440 --> 3:18:29.280]  the you know at the serve at the discretion no i agree you've got to watch police chiefs a lot
[3:18:29.280 --> 3:18:33.200]  more than the average cop because that's who's going to be infiltrated and well most of your
[3:18:33.200 --> 3:18:37.360]  police chiefs organizations are very left-wing they're very liberal they're very socialist
[3:18:37.920 --> 3:18:42.800]  and uh you have to be very careful they're anti-second amendment uh they're anti-first
[3:18:42.800 --> 3:18:46.320]  amendment i mean they're they're there's so many things that a lot of these chiefs fall
[3:18:46.320 --> 3:18:50.560]  in in right that that they wouldn't get picked for that position if they weren't that way uh if
[3:18:50.560 --> 3:18:54.560]  you get a good conservative right-wing police chief it's he's the odd man out you don't see that
[3:18:54.560 --> 3:18:57.520]  very much now you'll see that in the sheriff's because they're elected by the people there's a
[3:18:57.520 --> 3:19:03.280]  lot of good right-wing sheriffs out there there's a lot of good american uh patriotic uh uh home
[3:19:03.280 --> 3:19:08.160]  my right wing you mean paleo conservative yeah i'm talking true conservative america yeah we're
[3:19:08.160 --> 3:19:12.560]  going to skip this break uh for the info war stream listeners in prison planet on tv folks

[3:19:38.960 --> 3:19:45.840]  going on who's behind the power structure different things that are happening um i mean how do you
[3:19:45.840 --> 3:19:49.840]  see it unfolding with the international bankers right now i mean i know you're not predicting
[3:19:49.840 --> 3:19:56.320]  but what do you see happen well you know what this is this is october and october is the month of
[3:19:56.320 --> 3:20:01.280]  satan and october is when you have your october surprises october is when a lot of evil things
[3:20:01.280 --> 3:20:04.880]  happen october is when we have halloween i mean there's so many things that happen in the month of
[3:20:04.880 --> 3:20:11.120]  october leading up to what the election so within the next uh six weeks uh whatever's going to break
[3:20:11.120 --> 3:20:15.040]  loose is going to break loose and i i actually think that it's going to happen within the next
[3:20:15.040 --> 3:20:20.320]  seven to ten days within the next seven to ten days and and and we've been looking at this and i've
[3:20:20.320 --> 3:20:25.040]  all my intel intel guy buddies that i've talked to we all kind of you know try to war game the
[3:20:25.040 --> 3:20:31.600]  different scenarios out and we all feel uh since about last april or may that was all pointing to
[3:20:31.600 --> 3:20:36.240]  september or october of this year because it's an election year and several i've been hearing
[3:20:36.240 --> 3:20:41.440]  that for a year that this is the key zone this is it from all sorts of sources yeah this is the
[3:20:41.440 --> 3:20:46.400]  window this is the window of opportunity whatever they're going to do and like your last guest said
[3:20:46.400 --> 3:20:51.680]  i'm not real sure that we'll have the next election it could be to the point to where uh they suspend
[3:20:51.680 --> 3:20:57.760]  everything because of economic collapse just like with roosevelt who don't change horses in the middle
[3:20:57.760 --> 3:21:04.000]  of the stream exactly and uh they could declare a national emergency pdd 25 and all the rest of
[3:21:04.000 --> 3:21:08.720]  that stuff gets activated do you think they might be willing to be that obvious i think so i think
[3:21:08.720 --> 3:21:13.760]  because the american people if the media keeps pumping this big panic on us it's really not that
[3:21:13.760 --> 3:21:19.200]  big of a no isn't it amazing to to see the president saying depression i mean that that should cause
[3:21:19.200 --> 3:21:23.120]  one right there and then yeah it's these are the people you know he's the guy that's supposed to
[3:21:23.120 --> 3:21:28.240]  be saying it's not a huge deal don't panic everything's going to be fine we're just going to have to
[3:21:28.240 --> 3:21:34.400]  fix it and and and and shore up what we need to shore up but it's not your responsibility to do so
[3:21:34.400 --> 3:21:39.920]  we'll take care of it you know the whole thing uh boils down to the way the media is playing this
[3:21:39.920 --> 3:21:44.400]  thing up i mean you what you watch the guy on on the morning show at the stock market and he's
[3:21:44.400 --> 3:21:49.120]  panicking before the stock market even opens up he's up there getting so emotional and waving
[3:21:49.120 --> 3:21:54.240]  the mic around about how bad everything is and it could really go downhill today and yada yada
[3:21:54.240 --> 3:21:58.560]  well that what that does that spurs people to make it that way because they call her broker
[3:21:58.560 --> 3:22:02.480]  and they say sell everything i've got get rid of it and the price goes down the price goes down
[3:22:02.480 --> 3:22:08.240]  more people panic and it's a snowball effect and it's stupid how many sheep are out there who will
[3:22:08.240 --> 3:22:13.120]  buy off on this because here's what's happening somebody's out there buying that stuff now let's
[3:22:13.120 --> 3:22:20.160]  let's let's rewind the tape back to uh excuse me the Napoleonic Wars remember when Nathan Rothschild
[3:22:20.160 --> 3:22:25.840]  was uh at the London Stock Exchange during the Battle of Waterloo and the Rothschild no don't
[3:22:25.840 --> 3:22:30.800]  mean my new film Endgame covers that it's historical fact that they lied and said that Napoleon had
[3:22:30.800 --> 3:22:35.760]  won it crashed by 90 some percent and he bought it up and that's when they got their real power
[3:22:35.760 --> 3:22:41.040]  well the way it happened was uh they had a uh the Rothschild couriers were allowed to go any
[3:22:41.040 --> 3:22:44.800]  place they had a red bag that had a r on it on their horse and they could go any place because
[3:22:44.800 --> 3:22:48.880]  the troops led them through because they they they sent messages to both sides they were financing
[3:22:48.880 --> 3:22:53.680]  both sides and uh so the the Rothschild courier would ride up to the to the London Stock Exchange
[3:22:53.680 --> 3:22:58.000]  bond market and he would go inside and he would whisper in Nathan's ear who's a big fat guy sitting
[3:22:58.000 --> 3:23:02.480]  in the back of the room and Nathan just hang his head and just looked terrible oh my god what's
[3:23:02.480 --> 3:23:08.160]  happening here oh jeez and everybody's taking this is it that uh Wellington's losing the Battle
[3:23:08.160 --> 3:23:12.640]  of Waterloo and so they start selling the stock and then you know a few hours later another rider
[3:23:12.640 --> 3:23:16.800]  would come in he go back there and just Nathan Rothschild would just wring his hands and just
[3:23:16.800 --> 3:23:20.640]  oh my gosh i can't believe it the news is really bad but he wouldn't say anything to anybody yeah he
[3:23:20.640 --> 3:23:26.080]  would stand by the pillar pulling his hair out just oh yeah just oh really going through the deal
[3:23:26.080 --> 3:23:30.640]  well but what that was was that was mind control all right here we go we're back to the full audience
[3:23:30.640 --> 3:23:43.440]  continue boom ba ba boom jimmy Vaughn final segment with Colonel Craig Roberts i've got to get him
[3:23:43.440 --> 3:23:49.440]  up a lot sooner he was getting into the Rothschild's panicking the stock exchange basically putting
[3:23:49.440 --> 3:23:56.400]  out the disinfo that uh Napoleon had won the war to consolidate and it's through these crashes these
[3:23:56.400 --> 3:24:01.200]  elites have the power and the Rothschilds are the same elite that we had then that we have today
[3:24:01.840 --> 3:24:07.280]  finishing up with that uh Colonel Craig Roberts well and so here's Rothschild back there acting
[3:24:07.280 --> 3:24:12.480]  like they're all gloom and doom well all these people are selling their stock and bonds in the
[3:24:12.480 --> 3:24:17.680]  bank of england and well somebody's buying it up and at the end of the day here here comes this this
[3:24:17.680 --> 3:24:22.560]  uh this other rider up and and he i'm sorry it was a it was another rider but it wasn't a Rothschild
[3:24:22.560 --> 3:24:26.960]  courier it was a british army officer and he throws the door opens walks in and says god
[3:24:26.960 --> 3:24:31.120]  blessed the king wellington is the victor at waterloo and everybody looked around like
[3:24:31.120 --> 3:24:35.360]  my god what have i done and that what they did is they sold their country down the drain because
[3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:41.200]  they panicked and they pan and because they panicked i mean isn't this the definition of fire in the
[3:24:41.200 --> 3:24:46.080]  theater to have the secretary of the treasury the president the democratic leaders the republican
[3:24:46.080 --> 3:24:51.840]  leaders running around saying depression depression if you don't do what we want then they hammer the
[3:24:51.840 --> 3:24:57.600]  market uh... you know through the plunge protection team drive it down i mean this is pure terrorism
[3:24:57.600 --> 3:25:01.680]  people can debate whether nine eleven was an inside job but there's no doubt this economic
[3:25:01.680 --> 3:25:06.480]  terrorism stealing over a trillion two hundred billion yesterday biggest one day drop in history
[3:25:06.480 --> 3:25:12.000]  of the of the of the dowel i mean that that's terrorism isn't it colonel well in my mind it
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:16.000]  is because it's political terrorism it's mental terrorism it's well what's the definition of
[3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:23.120]  terrorism it's instilling instilling fear for political purposes so what they're doing unbelievable
[3:25:23.120 --> 3:25:28.160]  and and it's fooling some people they're saying okay i don't want to lose my 401k in my pension
[3:25:28.160 --> 3:25:32.560]  i guess i'll be for the bailout and then they sign the blank check as bloomberg reports it's
[3:25:32.560 --> 3:25:40.560]  really five trillion well it's it's you know the whole thing is a shift of power and it's creating
[3:25:40.560 --> 3:25:46.640]  a debt that uh... the average taxpayer out here is expected to pay for it's the illusion that we owe
[3:25:46.640 --> 3:25:50.800]  it and that they the bankers and engineers are the savers i gotta have you back sooner rather
[3:25:50.800 --> 3:25:55.200]  than later colonel because so much is happening let me set you up in the next few weeks to uh

[3:26:29.840 --> 3:26:34.080]  well and i think a more moral time because it's pretty obvious it's right in their face right

[3:32:56.800 --> 3:33:01.280]  the holy grail these two guys together because they just got reunited they're on tour and tell
[3:33:01.280 --> 3:33:05.760]  you all about that and how I can see it when they're coming to town I'm gonna go interview them
[3:33:05.760 --> 3:33:10.880]  behind the scenes maybe even get them in studio but regardless Tommy Chong is a great guy and we
[3:33:10.880 --> 3:33:14.560]  want to get an update on all the stuff that's happening with some of the films he's involved in
[3:33:14.560 --> 3:33:19.280]  some of the persecution he's gone through for his standing up against the police state but mainly
[3:33:19.280 --> 3:33:25.840]  about the Cheech and Chong reunion tour which is just fabulous now before we do that again this
[3:33:25.840 --> 3:33:31.840]  just broke I've known about it for a while I was basically pitched this TV show without looking for
[3:33:31.840 --> 3:33:37.920]  it and it was pitched to all these big ways they said we know it'll get huge ratings frankly another
[3:33:38.640 --> 3:33:44.240]  pilot was shot for Discovery Channel and one of the heads got axed over it I don't want to go into
[3:33:44.240 --> 3:33:50.320]  a long thing but it looks like with Ventura it's going to happen so I wanted to play this trailer
[3:33:50.320 --> 3:33:56.880]  um and I can't say any more but I'm glad Jesse got this job here it is
[3:34:00.640 --> 3:34:05.760]  these are other stories you hear in whispered conversations we're both in skull and bone
[3:34:05.760 --> 3:34:09.600]  at the secret society it's so super we can't talk about that
[3:34:12.640 --> 3:34:16.640]  one would think it wouldn't take very long for that to happen dealing with people like this
[3:34:16.640 --> 3:34:21.920]  these are the stories that offer different explanations these mothers have planned every
[3:34:21.920 --> 3:34:27.520]  monster you can imagine and I do this because I believe in this country they are the stories
[3:34:27.520 --> 3:34:37.680]  that must be told suspicion of our politicians is not new but the number of citizens who
[3:34:37.680 --> 3:34:43.440]  distrust the government today has reached an alarming new height in new york city
[3:34:43.440 --> 3:34:49.680]  nearly two-thirds of the population believes there is more to 9 11 than has been told I believe
[3:34:49.680 --> 3:34:55.440]  the title was been lot and determined to a attack inside the United States but where can viewers
[3:34:55.440 --> 3:35:05.920]  turn American conspiracy our nation's preeminent conspiracy expert radio host alex jones takes
[3:35:05.920 --> 3:35:13.680]  us beyond the stock stories of the mainstream media he asked the questions others won't consider have
[3:35:13.680 --> 3:35:19.440]  you been there for the ceremony with uh the cremation of care uh frankly that I don't think
[3:35:19.440 --> 3:35:24.320]  that's something I need to talk to you about he explores the places others only talk about
[3:35:24.320 --> 3:35:30.400]  you're beginning to see deeper in the rabbit hole he takes us through the doors others won't enter
[3:35:30.400 --> 3:35:37.520]  it again to imagine what we're going to discover
[3:35:40.240 --> 3:35:46.800]  all right it goes on and on anyways folks I'm so excited can you imagine jesse ventura
[3:35:46.800 --> 3:35:50.560]  because that's what they're doing time warner's announced it he's going to be charging around
[3:35:50.560 --> 3:35:55.760]  investigating the new world order and I'm just going to leave it there I'm going to leave it
[3:35:55.760 --> 3:36:02.720]  there who knows we'll be popping in I could never imagine this as a kid this is a listen
[3:36:02.720 --> 3:36:06.640]  let's go to tommy chung hey tommy you went public for 9 11 treat the few months ago
[3:36:06.640 --> 3:36:11.760]  I guess six eight months ago now on this show it's really great to see the fact that that this
[3:36:11.760 --> 3:36:17.280]  movement of not trusting what big brother tells us is going mainstream tommy chung yeah it sure is
[3:36:17.280 --> 3:36:25.840]  man you know I've watched the 9 11 was an inside job you know the one you the video you did and I
[3:36:25.840 --> 3:36:32.640]  was mesmerized for the hour and a half or whatever it was that it took because it opened my eyes I
[3:36:32.640 --> 3:36:40.400]  you know I had those feelings but I never really you know it never really gelled until I saw the
[3:36:40.400 --> 3:36:49.040]  proof and and now it just everything makes sense you know because again and look what they're doing
[3:36:49.040 --> 3:36:54.720]  today you know attacking wall street you know they're using wall street as the the 9 11 to get
[3:36:54.720 --> 3:37:00.400]  the more money out of the people oh you're absolutely on target there there's no doubt that
[3:37:00.400 --> 3:37:08.000]  they are orchestrating this and this is financial terrorism to say give us you know complete immunity
[3:37:08.000 --> 3:37:13.120]  for all the wall street crimes give us trillions it's not 700 billion or them we'll have a depression
[3:37:13.120 --> 3:37:18.480]  and then the biggest plunge in the market ever when congress says no and they blame it on congress
[3:37:18.480 --> 3:37:24.640]  that is amazing tommy yeah and and the thing is but it's like gambling you know what what what
[3:37:24.640 --> 3:37:29.920]  they're doing and and thank god the people aren't going for it is that you know these guys have
[3:37:29.920 --> 3:37:35.280]  got a gambling jones and they keep losing and and they want more money more money they're like a
[3:37:35.280 --> 3:37:41.040]  junkie that needs more heroin you know that and they'll never get enough and and and they're you
[3:37:41.040 --> 3:37:47.920]  trying to use that i mean you've seen how uh... uh... mccain try to be the be the knight uh...
[3:37:47.920 --> 3:37:52.720]  you know and shining armor rescuing everything oh yeah because put right into it when when it
[3:37:52.720 --> 3:37:57.760]  felt fell on its face and it wasn't just the democrats that they shot it down it was the
[3:37:57.760 --> 3:38:03.680]  uh... good old uh... the real conservative republicans shot it down absolutely and you
[3:38:03.680 --> 3:38:08.800]  talk about a heroin head as an analogy or as an example this is like a heroin head robbing
[3:38:08.800 --> 3:38:14.640]  your house your stereo in your jewelry except it's uh... ben Bernanke and and uh... mr uh...
[3:38:15.200 --> 3:38:19.760]  uh... you know treasury secretary paulson and bush that are doing yeah well as bush is
[3:38:19.760 --> 3:38:25.520]  bush and his cronies it's the final insult you know it's it's good bye we don't care about you
[3:38:26.240 --> 3:38:30.800]  you know and and and like you said you know where where who was it uh... i think it was uh...
[3:38:30.800 --> 3:38:36.160]  uh... michael moore pointed out the fact that bush is in totally owned by the Saudis
[3:38:36.880 --> 3:38:41.760]  by the way of michael moore now is in our new film truth rising saying that he's looking at 911
[3:38:41.760 --> 3:38:45.440]  being an inside job and police firemen have told them there were bombs in the building
[3:38:45.440 --> 3:38:48.720]  i mean they're gonna have a big problem with michael moore and all these other people
[3:38:48.720 --> 3:38:51.200]  are starting to go public tommy i they're in deep trouble
[3:38:51.760 --> 3:38:56.000]  well i know i know and the funny thing is like like like you know i mentioned this to cheat you
[3:38:56.000 --> 3:39:01.680]  know and cheats is uh... his dad was a cop and and cheats is uh... the straightest can be you
[3:39:01.680 --> 3:39:08.640]  know in on certain things and and cheats was very very uh... defensive for for him for these guys
[3:39:08.640 --> 3:39:13.760]  you know they said no no no no no he just laughed it off you know like oh no that would never happen
[3:39:14.480 --> 3:39:18.400]  and and he said you know that and my son too a paris he said
[3:39:18.400 --> 3:39:24.000]  oh no they can you can make any film you know say anything you want you know with the editing in
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:28.560]  that and so i never said anything i said but you know you guys just gotta watch this film
[3:39:28.560 --> 3:39:32.400]  just watch it yourself make up your own mind you know i i'm not going to be trying to sell
[3:39:32.400 --> 3:39:38.720]  anybody anything what film was that that you showed him yours yours oh really a terror storm
[3:39:38.720 --> 3:39:43.680]  what a what effect did that have on him well he hasn't seen it yet okay good oh you just gave
[3:39:43.680 --> 3:39:47.600]  it to me that would have seen it and so so that's what i'm going to make sure cheats sees it before
[3:39:47.600 --> 3:39:52.320]  he comes on the well i know that uh... terror storm that's what i first gave in turra two years ago
[3:39:52.320 --> 3:39:56.000]  in person in san antonio then let him to investigate
[3:39:56.000 --> 3:40:00.480]  then his son gave him loose change in ventura woke up and that's how this is working is
[3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:04.480]  person by person you know waking others up and it's so exciting
[3:40:04.480 --> 3:40:09.760]  uh... it is and it makes so much sense you know because uh... you know you you can see
[3:40:09.760 --> 3:40:15.520]  active terrorism you know like in in other countries you know but why would they pick
[3:40:15.520 --> 3:40:20.480]  that that that particular those particular targets well well why would the Arabs want to
[3:40:20.480 --> 3:40:24.080]  bring the wrath into their country but but i mean larger than that
[3:40:24.080 --> 3:40:27.200]  what what i ought to send you you probably know about it but i can send you the video
[3:40:27.200 --> 3:40:32.800]  clip of keith oberman reporting and sigh herge of new yorker that cheney just three months ago
[3:40:33.600 --> 3:40:40.320]  planned to paint up uh... u.s patrol boats like iranian boats and have navy seals dress up
[3:40:41.120 --> 3:40:49.200]  dress up uh... as iranians and attack our ships in the straight of or moose i mean that's admitted
[3:40:49.200 --> 3:40:50.400]  it
[3:40:50.400 --> 3:40:54.160]  well yeah you know yeah all that all that hanky panky's going on
[3:40:54.800 --> 3:40:57.760]  and and and you know the funny thing is elix is that
[3:40:58.400 --> 3:41:00.400]  that
[3:41:00.400 --> 3:41:04.560]  these guys uh... you know they're they're so short-sighted
[3:41:05.520 --> 3:41:10.160]  it it just boggles the mind how shallow how shallow you have to be
[3:41:11.280 --> 3:41:15.120]  to to go to that length for what purpose
[3:41:15.120 --> 3:41:22.720]  you know it's it's there's some sort of insanity that's that that it's really hard to comprehend
[3:41:22.720 --> 3:41:27.360]  you know well that's what a lot of our guests have been saying is that they know and i've
[3:41:27.360 --> 3:41:30.400]  interviewed all the people who are in the government or been in the government and they
[3:41:30.400 --> 3:41:35.520]  say that that's what this current crew was known as when they were junior 20 years ago was as the
[3:41:35.520 --> 3:41:41.440]  crazies yeah and they have nicknames like the prince of darkness richard pearl and that they do their
[3:41:41.440 --> 3:41:48.800]  risk takers like a psychopathic gamblers they they they want to get caught they want to go too far
[3:41:49.360 --> 3:41:53.520]  yeah well they're like those you know like the unabombers and those guys where they
[3:41:53.520 --> 3:41:58.400]  they they can't stand not being they they want the publicity they want the the uh
[3:41:59.040 --> 3:42:03.760]  like serial killers you know they want the notoriety they want to show people how clever
[3:42:03.760 --> 3:42:08.400]  they were and if they're so clever they can't get caught that that defeats their purpose
[3:42:08.400 --> 3:42:15.040]  and so they leave these signs around so that you will find out who who were there you know
[3:42:15.040 --> 3:42:22.160]  who were the nuts that that that perpetrated all this this uh disaster stuff exactly exactly
[3:42:22.160 --> 3:42:27.680]  well after world war two we were a very trusting country we began trusting our government too much
[3:42:27.680 --> 3:42:33.680]  we just beaten the evil nazis and then uh the people became very gullible but now the process
[3:42:33.680 --> 3:42:37.680]  of waking up to both parties and the whole system is pretty much complete nine percent
[3:42:37.680 --> 3:42:43.200]  approval rating for congress bush has the lowest approval rating of any president ever and uh 90
[3:42:43.200 --> 3:42:48.160]  plus percent against the bailout no matter all the fair mongering that the bankers engage in it
[3:42:48.160 --> 3:42:53.040]  looks to me like it's like somebody you know a cousin or something that cheats you one too many
[3:42:53.040 --> 3:42:58.560]  times and you just say i'm done with you oh yeah well you know when i when i was in prison the
[3:42:58.560 --> 3:43:06.720]  first thing or about the i eventually learned you know that the that everybody's has an angle
[3:43:06.720 --> 3:43:12.160]  you know and and these so-called friends would come up and be you know give me things and you
[3:43:12.160 --> 3:43:17.840]  know talk nice to be and know all about my family and that and they're all they're all con artists
[3:43:17.840 --> 3:43:24.560]  and they're all slick slick slick because everybody's got an angle and and and that's what uh uh
[3:43:25.200 --> 3:43:31.040]  you find out especially in the in the political world you know that that they make it look like
[3:43:31.040 --> 3:43:38.080]  one thing and then then they turn around you know i mean like they do the problem is yeah is that
[3:43:38.880 --> 3:43:44.480]  after they get caught then they're not trusted anymore and it's scary to say that a minority
[3:43:44.480 --> 3:43:50.320]  of people in government now don't have an angle and even a minority maybe of the general public i
[3:43:50.320 --> 3:43:54.720]  mean i'm not trying to be negative there's a lot of good people but i'm i'm look i've just learned
[3:43:54.720 --> 3:43:59.920]  what you've learned that even common folks have angles oh yeah instead of just stating what they
[3:43:59.920 --> 3:44:04.480]  want up front i don't understand it that's what i'm saying that's what i learned in jail
[3:44:04.480 --> 3:44:11.520]  you mean you find out that that the people love the game they love the game they love this uh you
[3:44:11.520 --> 3:44:17.040]  know like i was in there with the security of uh thief you know and he made millions and millions
[3:44:17.040 --> 3:44:23.840]  of dollars stealing you know uh manipulating the stock market and while while he was in there he
[3:44:23.840 --> 3:44:30.960]  had another company that was guess what running mortgages so while he was in prison he was running
[3:44:30.960 --> 3:44:37.200]  in mortgages he was into mortgages that's what he was doing while he was doing time and of course
[3:44:37.200 --> 3:44:41.280]  the mortgage when the mortgaging collapsed of course it collapsed because that's what these
[3:44:41.280 --> 3:44:46.400]  guys are in for but but his thrill wasn't making the millions and millions of dollars because he
[3:44:46.400 --> 3:44:52.560]  was so stoned all the time that he never enjoyed enjoyed his money ever it was the fact that he
[3:44:52.560 --> 3:44:57.280]  could do it well well that's what my dad years ago told me he would say and my grandfather too
[3:44:57.280 --> 3:45:02.000]  it's a son there's people that would rather steal a quarter from you than make a hundred dollars with
[3:45:02.000 --> 3:45:08.400]  you honestly they get a thrill out of screwing people and lying to people yeah and that's exactly
[3:45:08.400 --> 3:45:14.400]  what we have in power right today you know that's what the republican party is is filled with these
[3:45:14.400 --> 3:45:20.480]  people that that that are enjoying the game like carl roe for instance you know he gets more kick
[3:45:20.480 --> 3:45:25.840]  out of seeing a beat seeing how gullible these people are you know i mean by the way as you
[3:45:25.840 --> 3:45:32.240]  know tommy he said things like that to reporters before sure sure i know i know same as abramoff
[3:45:32.240 --> 3:45:37.520]  remember abramoff was stealing from the indians he was bragging about it it's unbelievable i want
[3:45:37.520 --> 3:45:42.400]  to get into the tour i want to get into some of the things that have happened with you aka tommy chung
[3:45:42.400 --> 3:45:46.960]  yeah the government seizing the the film but they only made it bigger i want to plug some of the
[3:45:46.960 --> 3:45:51.440]  stuff you're up to because we really love having you on to support everything you're doing tommy chung
[3:45:51.440 --> 3:45:58.560]  uh but uh i mean let's go ahead and get into that now first uh sure i mean giving us the latest
[3:45:58.560 --> 3:46:02.480]  development since you're on with us a few months ago with what happened with the film you were
[3:46:02.480 --> 3:46:07.280]  involved with and what's happened since then with with the continued persecution uh that you're
[3:46:07.280 --> 3:46:11.840]  under were henry paulson can steal hundreds of billions but you're in trouble for selling
[3:46:11.840 --> 3:46:18.480]  pipes yeah first of all for shipping a bong across no thinking thinking about shipping a
[3:46:18.480 --> 3:46:23.280]  bong because the conspiracy it was a conspiracy chart and again they had to hire someone to
[3:46:23.280 --> 3:46:28.400]  infiltrate your group to secretly mail it when you on record told them not to mail it to the
[3:46:28.400 --> 3:46:33.920]  sit oh my god that's right no and it's thinking it's a thought crime it was a thought crime
[3:46:33.920 --> 3:46:40.480]  but thinking of selling a paraphernalia a bong across the state line uh and and there's a lot
[3:46:40.480 --> 3:46:48.960]  and you know who who authored that law joseph biden unbelievable so so then a film comes out about
[3:46:48.960 --> 3:46:54.000]  this they don't want the film out tell folks what happens oh well what happened the film
[3:46:54.000 --> 3:46:59.600]  wasn't uh it was in in some financial trouble and then um you know because we couldn't get
[3:46:59.600 --> 3:47:05.600]  finishing money and then uh matt stevens uh of you're in luck you know the drug testing company
[3:47:05.600 --> 3:47:13.440]  that helps uh people pass drug tests uh he he stepped up and and he bought uh half interest
[3:47:13.440 --> 3:47:22.000]  in the in the film and so he so he was uh uh he his warehouse was stocking all the uh the the aka
[3:47:22.000 --> 3:47:28.080]  tomie chong film when he was raided by the feds and by the way was the same person mary beth
[3:47:28.080 --> 3:47:37.040]  Buchanan raided matt stevens's offices uh and and you know what the charges uh uh uh elix the
[3:47:37.040 --> 3:47:45.280]  charge is that because his drug testing is causing uh people to withhold information from the irs
[3:47:47.120 --> 3:47:53.200]  because of his drug testing unbelievable i mean they bend over that is their charge and so what
[3:47:53.200 --> 3:47:59.440]  they did when they when they uh they confiscated of course all his computers and you know it's a big
[3:47:59.440 --> 3:48:05.120]  drug testing ring they broke up you know and basically what he did was sell urine that was
[3:48:05.120 --> 3:48:12.480]  his his his job was selling urine to people that needed urine and so so so they got the urine and
[3:48:12.480 --> 3:48:22.320]  then they found the uh aka tomie chong uh uh uh cds or dvds and so they they confiscated a
[3:48:22.320 --> 3:48:28.560]  bunch of them you know and and when he asked him and they said uh you know you you get your stuff

[3:51:25.520 --> 3:51:31.200]  do the old the old stuff and and you know surprisingly enough the audience they just want
[3:51:31.200 --> 3:51:36.000]  to hear cheechinchong they don't they don't want us to get into any political rap i try to do a
[3:51:36.000 --> 3:51:42.160]  political rap in uh in detroit and and i got shouted down they didn't know political stuff they just
[3:51:42.160 --> 3:51:47.680]  want people want to laugh they don't want to get involved in thinking or anything else and so what
[3:51:47.680 --> 3:51:52.320]  they they're high and they just want to laugh at cheech and chongly the old days and so that's what
[3:51:52.320 --> 3:51:58.640]  we've been doing and and the shows have been incredible just incredible the the people line up
[3:51:58.640 --> 3:52:04.800]  for hours hours and sometimes days we we did a show in Los Angeles where they they camped out
[3:52:04.800 --> 3:52:10.880]  overnight because we there was only like 300 tickets and and people were camped out for like
[3:52:10.880 --> 3:52:17.440]  two days before the event just to get to get in line to to to get a chance to get a ticket so

[3:52:24.320 --> 3:52:29.760]  and he he's loving it he's just having the best time of his life and i've been having the best
[3:52:29.760 --> 3:52:34.400]  time and and and being back together again i mean there was such a love and such a
[3:52:34.400 --> 3:52:40.960]  a magic chemistry between us that that is still there well i remember being a little kid and
