[00:00.000 --> 00:19.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[00:19.000 --> 00:30.000]  Well, I'm ready to say it on this Sunday, the 16th day of August 2015 worldwide broadcast. I'm ready to say it right now.
[00:30.000 --> 00:38.000]  I may have been wrong about Donald Trump because he is doing things right now politically.
[00:38.000 --> 00:45.000]  He is engaging in activities that are not what a scripted controlled candidate would do.
[00:45.000 --> 00:55.000]  He is causing the Clinton crime machine irrevocable harm on an absolutely massive scale.
[00:55.000 --> 01:02.000]  Now I've said I've given him the benefit of the doubt because he's supported both parties in the past and owns casinos
[01:02.000 --> 01:09.000]  and has his own list of problems and has been part of WWE wrestling, but I've got friends that have been part of that.
[01:09.000 --> 01:16.000]  And we're right to not just trust people that are long term politicians like Donald Trump.
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.000]  People think he's an outsider. He's a consummate insider to a certain point.
[01:21.000 --> 01:31.000]  He's made his money though off the service economy and off of real estate and off of products, not off of central banking like the globalist.
[01:31.000 --> 01:39.000]  So when he comes out and says Hillary should step down from the campaign trail, that she has a criminal probe, that she's probably going to get indicted.
[01:39.000 --> 01:50.000]  I mean, these are the things that will destroy that so-called aura of invincibility that people like the Clintons have.
[01:50.000 --> 02:01.000]  It is a big, big deal and there is a very good chance, not just intellectually or politically, but at my gut level, that Hillary Clinton is about to fall.
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.000]  And man, it couldn't happen sooner.
[02:03.000 --> 02:11.000]  And I really was watching different Sunday morning news shows meet the press, face the nation this morning, trying to monitor their propaganda.
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.000]  I mean, I wasn't tuning in to learn anything from their lies.
[02:15.000 --> 02:22.000]  That is from them, from the perspective they were pitching the propaganda, but from how they were spinning, how they were behaving.
[02:22.000 --> 02:29.000]  They showed some footage on one of the shows of Democrats meeting at Martha's Vineyard playing golf.
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.000]  And I've watched a lot of footage of presidents and their minions playing golf.
[02:32.000 --> 02:39.000]  Clinton looks like he's the walking dead and like he's a concentration camp victim not long for this world.
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  Maybe your soul sucked out at some point.
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  That's how Al Sharpton looks too, and he's been around a while.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  And Obama looks like hell.
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  Hillary looks like hell.
[02:49.000 --> 02:51.000]  They all look completely insane.
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.000]  I mean, if I saw Bill Clinton walk down the street, I'd say that's a mentally ill and sane person.
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  I mean, he looks like a Heaven's Gate cult leader or something.
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.000]  I mean, look at him in the photo if you're watching this on TV.
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  I mean, that's a fruit loop right there.
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.000]  And in my fruit loop, there's no life in it.
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.000]  So I think there's big shakeups in the power structure because there's two different economies.
[03:12.000 --> 03:20.000]  There's billionaires and millionaires and middle class and working class folks that are based on free market that want prosperity,
[03:20.000 --> 03:29.000]  that want wealth, that want an economy that's healthy because they're the type of rich that gets hurt by an economy not doing well.
[03:29.000 --> 03:37.000]  Then there's the globalists who control all the currency and credit and have unlimited fake wealth who are at war with other wealth they don't control,
[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  who want poverty to control people.
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  And there's the big fight between those two different groups.
[03:42.000 --> 03:49.000]  I mean, you can boil it down to free market capitalist and crony neo feudal capitalist.
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  You can put any different labels you want on all day long.
[03:52.000 --> 03:53.000]  That's what's going on.
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  So ultra huge news on that front.
[03:55.000 --> 03:57.000]  We've got all the clips coming up and more.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  Then we've got some really good news.
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.000]  Arkansas becomes the fourth state to defund Planned Parenthood after it sells aborted babies.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  We're seeing implosion level events by the globalist right now.
[04:08.000 --> 04:18.000]  STEM Express that was buying the baby parts from the eugenics society now is Planned Parenthood is cutting ties and not buying the goods anymore.
[04:18.000 --> 04:21.000]  So huge, huge positive news on that front.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  We've got the latest on police chief sheriffs blast ice over policy.
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  They say freeze violent illegal immigrants.
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  The law actually does not give us the right to place an ice hold.
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.000]  We'll get into the latest on the economy, Cuba, Syria, Japan as a big volcano.
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  Get ready to go off right next to a nuclear power plant.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  So we have another Fukushima on our hands.
[04:45.000 --> 04:50.000]  Why do you build these plants on fault lines, tsunami lines and volcanic rifts?
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  Japan's a very active tectonic country.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  Mother houses are made out of paper.
[04:56.000 --> 04:59.000]  I mean why do we build all the reactors there?
[04:59.000 --> 05:05.000]  Super male vitality is InfowarsLife.com's number one selling product for a good reason.

[06:22.000 --> 06:32.000]  It is the 16th day of August 2015.
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[06:35.000 --> 06:42.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, broadcasting on different formats worldwide,
[06:42.000 --> 06:45.000]  reaching 20 million people a week one way or another.
[06:45.000 --> 06:54.000]  I am extremely honored to be your host and to be working with the great reporters and the folks behind the scenes and the anchors
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  for Infowars Radio and Infowars TV.
[06:57.000 --> 07:01.000]  Find all the details at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[07:01.000 --> 07:04.000]  And certainly please send that link on to friends and family.
[07:04.000 --> 07:12.000]  You are the main engine of the success of this Americana constitutional renaissance pro-freedom pro-prosperity message
[07:12.000 --> 07:19.000]  to make humanity great again, not just America.
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  I'm going to say it right here on air.
[07:22.000 --> 07:30.000]  I am rarely wrong in a big way, very rarely.
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  But sometimes I am.
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  I mean, I get dates wrong and sometimes say a guest's name wrong or sometimes flip facts around in my head.
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  We all do that in a busy world.
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.000]  I'm teleprompter free.
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  You can write news articles and you're going to have typos and problems sometimes.
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  This isn't all written up prefab.
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.000]  This is research.
[07:51.000 --> 07:52.000]  This is passion.
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  This is a world understanding.
[07:54.000 --> 07:56.000]  But it is unscripted.
[07:56.000 --> 07:57.000]  So there's mistakes.
[07:57.000 --> 08:06.000]  But I rarely fundamentally misgage major geopolitical movements and national movements.
[08:06.000 --> 08:11.000]  Because I've been doing this 23 years on air over 20.
[08:11.000 --> 08:16.000]  And I've learned who the players are, who the different clubs are, who the different power structures are.
[08:16.000 --> 08:26.000]  And in the last 20 plus years, it's been the same group of players, several different camps, but globalists all the same, that have been in control.
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  And I've learned how Zbigniew Brzezinski runs a White House.
[08:29.000 --> 08:33.000]  I've learned how Henry Kissinger advises a White House.
[08:33.000 --> 08:37.000]  I've learned how George Schultz runs an operation.
[08:37.000 --> 08:41.000]  I've learned how A. James Baker runs an operation.
[08:41.000 --> 08:44.000]  I've learned how David Gergen runs an operation.
[08:44.000 --> 08:50.000]  And these are the people that go and talk to the major shareholders of the corporate world government.
[08:50.000 --> 08:56.000]  And then who come and basically tell the White House and the congressional leaders how the cow ate the cabbage.
[08:56.000 --> 09:09.000]  And then if you know where those people are going and what they want and what their agenda is, you'll know what they're going to pull before it even happens.
[09:09.000 --> 09:18.000]  That said, before I get into my correction here today.
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.000]  And again, I would be happy to be completely wrong because it would change my worldview about things.
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  I'm only partially wrong.
[09:26.000 --> 09:35.000]  And I think it's important for all of us to realize that the closer we get to something, the more knowledge we have about it and the more wisdom we have at one level.
[09:35.000 --> 09:44.000]  But also you can get so close to the abyss to quote Nishi that you become the abyss and you become too cynical.
[09:44.000 --> 09:55.000]  Because for all the complexity in the world and all the globalist tools of social engineering, still they're not gods. They're not in total control.
[09:55.000 --> 10:09.000]  And when people are promoting freedom, when they are promoting ideas that are so popular and so transcendent, it's going to catch on, especially when things start to get tyrannical.
[10:09.000 --> 10:19.000]  That's why tyrants always seek to shut down opposition because they know opposition is going to be popular when things get rough.
[10:19.000 --> 10:25.000]  Now, what am I getting at here?
[10:25.000 --> 10:34.000]  Donald Trump owns casinos. I don't really like gambling, especially at an industrial scale. I think it chumps people.
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  But I'm a libertarian, so if you want casinos, go ahead and have them.
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  It doesn't mean I have to agree with them.
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.000]  I gamble in other ways. For liberty and freedom, I gamble with my life, my name, my treasure.
[10:47.000 --> 11:02.000]  I don't gamble at some mafia organization or some big multinational corporations' tables when the deck is stacked, when the tables are slanted.
[11:02.000 --> 11:09.000]  So he's involved in casinos, and I don't like that. But he's involved in a lot of other free market activities.
[11:09.000 --> 11:15.000]  I think you're admirable and fine, and I admire people that have basically been successful by the sweat of their brow.
[11:15.000 --> 11:22.000]  On the scale of billionaires, he's one of the poorest, worth about $4 billion. He hides a lot of his wealth. He's probably worth $20 billion.
[11:22.000 --> 11:30.000]  And even Forbes says that. The real power of this world is worth $100 billion apiece. People like Bill Gates, most of his wealth is hidden.
[11:30.000 --> 11:37.000]  The Queen of England's wealth is a state secret. So is the Queen of the Netherlands. These people are worth trillions. So are the Rothschilds.
[11:37.000 --> 11:44.000]  So what I'm getting at there is Donald Trump is not in the upper echelons of power.
[11:44.000 --> 11:52.000]  If you go out in national studies, and they've done them in Manila Street interviews, most people in America believe Donald Trump is the richest man.
[11:52.000 --> 12:09.000]  And that's because he's had TV shows, drama shows, reality shows, wrestling shows. For 30 years, he's been on the scene as Richie Rich, his daddy, with all of his European wives, and all the rest of it.
[12:09.000 --> 12:16.000]  And hosting the Miss America contest and whatever.
[12:16.000 --> 12:24.000]  So he is Americana. You can say what you want about him. He is Americana kind of rock star-ish.
[12:24.000 --> 12:33.000]  He plays golf with the Clintons. He hangs around them. He's given the Democrats more money than Republicans. I get his statement about having to do business.
[12:33.000 --> 12:38.000]  As a corporate owner, you have to give to both parties so they destroy you. That's pretty much true.
[12:38.000 --> 12:52.000]  What he's been saying the last three months since he got in the campaign is been spot on. He's been demonized and attacked. So if you don't defend his ideas, whether he stands form or not, you're letting the enemy win by building a straw man.
[12:52.000 --> 12:58.000]  So I've defended him on that front. And, you know, Jesse Ventura has even said he's, quote, shaking the political system to its core.
[12:58.000 --> 13:07.000]  We've got Ventura coming on next week. But that said, it didn't mean I trusted Donald Trump, but I left it open.
[13:07.000 --> 13:21.000]  But I said on air, I think he helps Hillary Clinton. He helps distract away from all the other Republican candidates like Rand Paul and others that was the front leader just three months ago.
[13:21.000 --> 13:32.000]  And if he drops out or runs his third party, he will then checkmate the Republicans and ensure a Democrat gets in like Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden, who's not saying he may enter the race.
[13:32.000 --> 13:43.000]  So if he leaves the third party, he'll get the Democrats in. If he is a shell for Hillary and falls on his sword and starts making a bunch of really stupid statements or drops out, we know he's a shell.
[13:43.000 --> 13:54.000]  He'll be anathema. His name will be dirt. He hadn't really attacked the Clintons yet or Jeb Bush, who we know the Clintons and the Bushes definitely vacation together.
[13:54.000 --> 14:04.000]  They call each other, you know, brothers and sisters, Bush seniors, wife calls Clinton her son. I mean, it's sick. They're involved in corrupt charities together.
[14:04.000 --> 14:17.000]  You know, we're half the money goes to their, their luxury jets and hotels and houses. I mean, it's a sick mess. So we know the Bushes and the Clintons are in it together, totally staged.
[14:17.000 --> 14:28.000]  I've been watching Trump and I'm here to tell you when I say I'm wrong. I was just saying I don't trust him, but I hope he's for real.
[14:28.000 --> 14:36.000]  What he's doing now and watching his body language and everything he's doing, he's running to win.
[14:36.000 --> 14:42.000]  He is saying Hillary needs to step down is probably going to be indicted and is basically a criminal.
[14:42.000 --> 14:54.000]  He is saying that this email thing is a big deal in the cover up. If he was working with them, he wouldn't be doing that because these are broadside torpedoes and Hillary is starting to sink right now.
[14:54.000 --> 15:03.000]  Praise God. This is irrevocable damage. Irrevocable when he started doing it on Friday almost came into a special report. It's so important.
[15:03.000 --> 15:13.000]  And this is probably the end of Hillary. All of her hubris, her arrogance. I don't want to say she's down yet, but she goes beneath the waves.
[15:13.000 --> 15:24.000]  But she's on fire. Her magazine is exploding. Her armaments on board have caught fire. She is sinking fast. I mean, she is going down fast.
[15:24.000 --> 15:34.000]  Clinton looks like he's dying. Her husband, her beard, but I'm not against her that she's a lesbian. It's just that their daughter is not, you know, it's just all staged.
[15:34.000 --> 15:50.000]  That's her hubble's daughter. She's seen more women than a, you know, pink bicycle seat. I mean, you know, the whole point is that this is a day to remember.
[15:50.000 --> 15:59.000]  The Clinton dynasty is circling the toilet bowl. This is just so beautiful. Thank you, Donald Trump. Thank you, my cupcake.

[18:03.000 --> 18:14.000]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[18:14.000 --> 18:17.000]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.

[18:26.000 --> 18:30.000]  This is the good halogen. This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.

[20:21.000 --> 20:25.000]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[20:25.000 --> 20:28.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  And this is the Sunday Transmission.
[20:30.000 --> 20:33.000]  We're here live every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[20:33.000 --> 20:37.000]  Back weekdays, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central time as well.
[20:37.000 --> 20:40.000]  InfoWars.com is the main site.
[20:40.000 --> 20:47.000]  Backed up by PrisonPlanet.com, the Facebook, the Twitter, the YouTube channels, PrisonPlanet.tv and more.
[20:47.000 --> 20:52.000]  So I have all this other world news. It's all very important. The good news, the bad news, the ugly news.
[20:52.000 --> 21:00.000]  But here are just the stack of articles today, many of which are up on InfoWars.com with extended videos,
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.000]  detailing how big a deal this is to have Donald Trump doing what he's doing.
[21:04.000 --> 21:11.000]  Because I can tell, you can tell, a $3 bill from pretty far away.
[21:11.000 --> 21:21.000]  And the fact that Trump is now eviscerating Hillary and Jeb Bush, the fact that he is now basically saying he's a criminal
[21:21.000 --> 21:32.000]  and telling her to step down, the fact that Biden is preparing to enter the race, shows that Clintons are falling apart in front of us.
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  It's so wonderful. And it's not some personal vendetta I have with him.
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  This is a very dangerous criminal duo.
[21:40.000 --> 21:44.000]  And I'm personally on their enemies list. That's been in the newspapers.
[21:44.000 --> 21:49.000]  Hundreds of other people are. I've been persecuted. I'm sick of them. They're a particularly nasty group.
[21:49.000 --> 21:56.000]  They've been running Obama the whole time. And the fact that they're in deep trouble could not be more deserved.
[21:56.000 --> 22:01.000]  I mean, it would be a devastating victory for this country if both of them got indicted.
[22:01.000 --> 22:05.000]  Because they're both involved in crimes that go around the world.
[22:05.000 --> 22:11.000]  And here are the headlines. Trump on Clinton emails. It's a criminal probe. I'm going to play a clip of that in a moment.
[22:11.000 --> 22:16.000]  That's from CNN. An incredibly bold statement.
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  Trump better watch it in his helicopters and jets because.
[22:21.000 --> 22:31.000]  And by the way, I'm not saying Trump's ever been perfect, but he makes his money again off the free market being successful and the country being wealthy.
[22:31.000 --> 22:37.000]  And if he is an actor, he's even better than Obama. He looks seriously concerned when he talks about loss of jobs.
[22:37.000 --> 22:41.000]  When he talks about the country rotting. He's the type of peacock.
[22:41.000 --> 22:46.000]  It's not bad to be a narcissist peacock who wants to be great.
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  There were a lot of Caesars in Rome where they had big booms.
[22:50.000 --> 22:56.000]  Where the Caesar actually wanted to have free market and wealth and power and public works projects that didn't want to suppress the middle class.
[22:56.000 --> 22:59.000]  And it wasn't jealous of having a middle class.
[22:59.000 --> 23:03.000]  And I don't think Donald Trump is afraid of success for the people.
[23:03.000 --> 23:11.000]  The Cloward and Piven Insider Ford Foundation Clinton types want you poor so they can control you.
[23:11.000 --> 23:18.000]  And when Trump says cut taxes by 40% and more tax money will come in, the average person doesn't understand.
[23:18.000 --> 23:23.000]  When you cut taxes massively, it increases tax receipts because people start building.
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  They start spending. They start investing.
[23:25.000 --> 23:32.000]  It's fact. Kennedy cut taxes by 50% in the main tax bracket.
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.000]  Biggest boom this country's seen post-World War II.
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  And the deficit went down.
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.000]  Okay, I've read one headline. Trump on Clinton emails, it's a criminal problem.
[23:44.000 --> 23:52.000]  So there becomes a point where whether Trump's good or bad, what he's doing is, as the number one media person in the country now,
[23:52.000 --> 23:58.000]  getting all this attention, he is destroying Hillary Clinton.
[23:58.000 --> 24:04.000]  Putting it over the top as all this comes out and then giving everybody cover to go after her.
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.000]  Because if you individually go after them, they come after you.
[24:07.000 --> 24:13.000]  But if everybody goes after them, they can be destroyed.
[24:13.000 --> 24:17.000]  And then that scares all the other crooks to not be so arrogant.
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  Trump on Clinton emails, it's a criminal probe.
[24:20.000 --> 24:23.000]  Hillary, we're going to play this clip, putting on her con game.
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.000]  And I've told you the arrogance is because they're scared.
[24:26.000 --> 24:30.000]  That's meant to put the perception on everything's fine, keeping up appearances.
[24:30.000 --> 24:36.000]  Hillary on Snapchat, I love how messages disappear all by themselves and her sickening,
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  fawning, totalitarian cult members giggle and laugh.
[24:40.000 --> 24:46.000]  And the media admits she's rubbing it in everyone's face with a confidence game.
[24:46.000 --> 24:50.000]  I saw hundreds of headlines when I searched her quote today for the show.
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.000]  It was just hundreds of headlines, only scanned 20 of them or so.
[24:53.000 --> 24:57.000]  All going, Hillary makes jokes about disappearing emails.
[24:57.000 --> 25:01.000]  Hillary arrogantly puts on a good face.
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  And you're like, okay, anybody can tell that.
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  Used to mainstream media wouldn't call her out.
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  See, now it's safe.
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  Most people in the system don't like the corruption.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  They're scared, though.
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  What did Mark Twain say, my favorite quote?
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.000]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated, feared and scorned.
[25:19.000 --> 25:25.000]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[25:25.000 --> 25:30.000]  Info wars job, drudges job, world net daily job and others like that.
[25:30.000 --> 25:37.000]  Our job as constitutional libertarian types is to tell it like it is against both parties,
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.000]  hit the barbed wire and make it safe for other people to follow behind us.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  That's what leadership is.
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  Doing the right thing no matter what other people think about you.
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.000]  And look how it continues to pay off.
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  Forgetting the truth out.
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.000]  And now look at Trump engaging in real leadership.
[25:57.000 --> 26:00.000]  And I know it's this constituents putting heat on him.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  Hillary on Snapchat, we're going to play that.
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.000]  Donald Trump, it would be a miracle if Hillary continues to run NBC News.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.000]  I've got that clip.
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.000]  Exclusive, Donald Trump expects to face VP Joe Biden in general election.
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.000]  Hillary Clinton's big league email scandal will force her out.
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  I just love it.
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  Joe Biden said to be considering one term presidency.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  Boom.
[26:22.000 --> 26:28.000]  Number of Hillary emails fly for classified data grows to 60 as review continues.
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.000]  Petraeus was indicted and had to plea bargain to felonies.
[26:33.000 --> 26:39.000]  To a suspended prison sentence for talking to his girlfriend about classified stuff that didn't matter.
[26:39.000 --> 26:48.000]  I'm not defending Petraeus, but literally, literally he had like a little bit of milk dripped on his tie.
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  Or a little catch up and they try to put him in prison for it.
[26:52.000 --> 27:02.000]  And then this woman takes money from third world dictators at the State Department to her foundation and then removes the export ban on heavy weapons.
[27:02.000 --> 27:08.000]  You know, any tank missiles?
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  Amazing.
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  So there's some of the news on that front.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  It begins actually didn't begin.
[27:14.000 --> 27:15.000]  I saw these a year ago.
[27:15.000 --> 27:16.000]  I'm going to put a t-shirt out that said it.
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.000]  We're going to do it.
[27:17.000 --> 27:18.000]  It begins.
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  Hillary for prison signs spotted in Missouri.
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.000]  Yeah, they're popping up all over.
[27:21.000 --> 27:25.000]  In fact, I'm going to emergency print up Hillary for prison signs.
[27:25.000 --> 27:30.000]  2016 and bumper stickers and we're going to sell them at cost.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  So months ago told the crew to do this.
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  I don't know if the production crew ever did it.
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.000]  They may have even done it.
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  But we're going to put these out because I saw it months ago, a guy in Austin driving around with one.
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.000]  Absolutely.
[27:41.000 --> 27:50.000]  And if a Republican acts like this, we're going to put out, you know, Jeb Bush for prison signs if he does stuff like this.
[27:50.000 --> 27:59.000]  There's a new national poll out and the Hill was reporting on a majority of Americans believe she lied about having sensitive national intelligence on her private email server.
[27:59.000 --> 28:03.000]  Yeah, why did the head of the EPA remember her a few years ago to step down?
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  She had a gnome to plume, a pen name with secret emails.
[28:07.000 --> 28:18.000]  They engage in secret emails and use code names like Hillary was using because they're engaged in criminal activity outside of the four year system.
[28:18.000 --> 28:19.000]  We're going to go to Blake.
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.000]  When we come back, I'm going to play Donald Trump on Clinton email says it's a criminal problem.
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.000]  Donald Trump goes on to then say it'd be a miracle if she continues to run.
[28:28.000 --> 28:34.000]  And then Hillary making the sickening joke about her disappeared emails.
[28:34.000 --> 28:42.000]  I mean, she professionally wiped the hard drives because the stuff's all still really on there.
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  So she had it professionally wiped.
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.000]  That's called felony obstruction of justice.
[28:48.000 --> 29:00.000]  Four to 10 years in federal prison on its face for each email she erased to abscond justice.
[29:00.000 --> 29:04.000]  The FBI has arrested a pair of ISIS wannabes in Mississippi.
[29:04.000 --> 29:07.000]  The newlyweds allegedly claimed via social media.
[29:07.000 --> 29:10.000]  They plan to travel to Syria and join ISIS.
[29:10.000 --> 29:15.000]  This follows the arrest of another ISIS wannabe in New Jersey earlier this week.
[29:15.000 --> 29:23.000]  This latest incident follows a now well established pattern engaging in online conversations with FBI agents posing as terrorists.
[29:23.000 --> 29:35.000]  In May, declassified defense documents from 2012 revealed the U.S. and its partners in the Gulf States and Turkey supported the Islamic State and plan to establish a Salafist principality in Syria.
[29:35.000 --> 29:50.000]  And in 2011, a report revealed the FBI organizes nearly all terror plots in the U.S. FBI agents and operatives find suspects that could potentially carry out lone wolf attacks and then more or less encourage them to do so.
[29:50.000 --> 29:54.000]  Only to bust them before any of the events fully materialize.
[29:54.000 --> 30:19.000]  You can find more reports at infowars.com.

[33:19.000 --> 33:29.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[33:49.000 --> 34:03.000]  That has backfired massively. And now he is basically jumping in against Clinton and against Jeb Bush at a time for me that points towards the fact that he may be for real.
[34:03.000 --> 34:11.000]  But regardless, his rhetoric is damaging the globalist agenda right now. Something a staged candidate would not be doing.
[34:11.000 --> 34:19.000]  So what's really behind this? We'll break down what I think is going on and play these clips here in a moment.
[34:19.000 --> 34:27.000]  First off, it was sold out for quite a while. It's one of our best sellers, if not THE best seller, depending on the month.
[34:27.000 --> 34:45.000]  That's super male vitality. 5 years of research, 10 plus known concentrated cold pressed organic herbs that help your body produce and release the key compounds that you need to have stamina, libido, energy, you name it.
[34:45.000 --> 35:00.000]  All I can say is the effects of super male vitality now being on it for a year, plus many years before that in development with top researchers, chemists, herbologists and others, it's been life changing.
[35:00.000 --> 35:20.000]  And similar formulas that aren't even as good and use dry herbs are upwards of twice as much, generally about 70% more. So it's very, very competitively priced. It's available at infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[35:20.000 --> 35:33.000]  And we have the third party review system, one of the most highly respected review sites out there. You can link through and read the 5.0 reviews.
[35:33.000 --> 35:45.000]  Most of the reviews are five star. The overall average is 4.8 for all of the infowarslife.com products. The overall score for super male is 4.9 stars.
[35:45.000 --> 36:03.000]  And we have links to other third party respected review sites. And you've heard the callers. Here's what Wolf Castle in Arbor Dean Scotland had to say, I use this every day as reduced cramp after cycling 20 miles a day.
[36:03.000 --> 36:16.000]  I also use the iodine and the combination improvement stamina is at least 10% boost compared to before when using super male vitality next to great combo highly recommend.
[36:16.000 --> 36:29.000]  That review came in just a few days ago on the 12th. Here is a another review from John in Kalispell, Montana.
[36:29.000 --> 36:35.000]  I know the male vitality is supposed to help with my energy, but what it really seems to do most for me is help me remember things.
[36:35.000 --> 36:44.000]  I'm always rushing around with a million things to do. This helps keep me on track of what I'm doing. Also kind of helps me slow down a bit with the task I do.
[36:44.000 --> 36:51.000]  So I don't get all frenzies and rush too fast. Interesting stuff. Yes, I would recommend it to a friend.
[36:51.000 --> 37:00.000]  The effects are different for different people, but the big one everybody notices is what happens in the morning when you wake up at 6am.
[37:00.000 --> 37:13.000]  And I'm just telling you that I'll just be honest with people. I don't need Cialis or Viagra, but as a man 41 years old, you know, I once the doctor had a checkup a year ago or whatever.
[37:13.000 --> 37:21.000]  And they just say, you want some? I said, sure, I'll try it. And I have bottles of both Cialis and Viagra that I never used.
[37:21.000 --> 37:29.000]  I'll just be honest. I mean, I used a few of them because it doesn't have the effect super male does. And I don't need super male either.
[37:29.000 --> 37:36.000]  It's just it takes it to the next level. And let's not be a bunch of kids here if you're like, oh my gosh, he's talking about, you know, libido pills.
[37:36.000 --> 37:45.000]  That's just a idea of what it does for everything else because that's not really why I take it. But I was curious when the doctor offered it.
[37:45.000 --> 37:54.000]  I have a prescription for both. Well, okay, I mean, I really noticed the difference with super male about the group said I would. I wonder what this does.
[37:54.000 --> 38:04.000]  See, super male does more than that does for me, but my face doesn't turn bright red. I mean, you take a Viagra looks like, you know, you turn into red.
[38:04.000 --> 38:14.000]  So all I'm saying is this is serious stuff. Infowarslife.com or 888-2533139.
[38:14.000 --> 38:21.000]  Brainforce came back in, but it will be sold out by tomorrow. We're down to just the last 10% of the bottles. And we'll have more coming in two weeks.
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.000]  If you want that, Infowarslife.com as well. Your purchase of the products helps fund this independent media organization.

[38:34.000 --> 38:41.000]  Here's what's going on with Donald Trump. He goes back to the founding of our country. Why do we have three branches of government?
[38:41.000 --> 38:54.000]  Because the founders knew that cliques, gangs, strong men, Napoleon Bonaparte types, Hitler types, King George types, William the Conqueror types, Julius Caesar types,
[38:54.000 --> 39:04.000]  would try to come in. If there was one branch, they could take it over. But if you set up other people in control of other powerful branches,
[39:04.000 --> 39:15.000]  they would tend to compete with each other and use the Constitution as checks on the other. And that because we have three centers of government,
[39:15.000 --> 39:25.000]  that would not allow a dictatorship to form. Now the bureaucracy and the CIA above the law and the National Security Act of 47 and the media being bought off by big corporations,
[39:25.000 --> 39:35.000]  that's kind of been checked, but not checkmated, but still it acts. And somebody like Donald Trump, it's got four plus billion dollars, tens of billions and other assets,
[39:35.000 --> 39:43.000]  who makes his money off having a rich economy, off people vacationing, people buying products, people buying nice condos, houses.
[39:43.000 --> 39:56.000]  He gets hurt by an economy shutting down. The fact that he has to say, make America great again, shows how much freedom we've lost and that we really know we're in a long cold depression.
[39:56.000 --> 40:05.000]  And he speaks to that. He says, look, our borders are wide open. We don't have good negotiators. Everybody can come here and have babies for free and criminals can come here.
[40:05.000 --> 40:15.000]  It's wrong. I'll turn things around. I'll cut taxes by 40%. That's all true. That would work if he's for real.
[40:15.000 --> 40:24.000]  But then he goes after Hillary Clinton, the rest of it, clearly now, for whatever reason, they thought it was a joke at first.
[40:24.000 --> 40:37.000]  And he still may be blackmailed at maybe a setup. But listen, he could be president now. He is the hands down front runner. If he would work with someone like Rand Paul that bring in a lot of anti-war Democrats,
[40:37.000 --> 40:45.000]  he better not double cross people or I tell you, he is going to be in big trouble. He will be boycotted. People will come after him politically.
[40:45.000 --> 40:53.000]  But regardless, he's going after the Clintons now, which is a big deal. Let's go ahead and go to one of these clips, but it's the separation of powers.
[40:53.000 --> 41:03.000]  Trump wants to be president. And there's been a lot of leaders in history that weren't perfect, but they wanted to have a big, powerful country under him.
[41:03.000 --> 41:11.000]  That's more like a boss-hog management instead of wanting everybody poor to control him. And the Trump type doesn't want a bunch of poor people under him.
[41:11.000 --> 41:19.000]  He wants wealthy people. He wants success. He is a capitalist at the end of the day. He's totally different than, you know, Barack Obama and a Cloward and Piven.
[41:19.000 --> 41:28.000]  Let's bankrupt people and make them dependent on us. And I'm not lionizing him saying he's perfect. Again, he says arrest Snowden, executing me as a traitor.
[41:28.000 --> 41:36.000]  He's got some major problems, but it's night and day and it shows how the country's upset. Let's go to this first clip. We'll come back with the rest.
[41:36.000 --> 41:46.000]  This is Trump on Clinton emails saying he has a criminal problem. This is bold, folks. This means he's really going after him. He's really running for president.
[41:46.000 --> 41:52.000]  Because this just won't get him in the lead, which he's already in the lead, and then he can drop out later for Hillary.
[41:52.000 --> 42:01.000]  This will destroy her if he gets on board with all his supporters calling for criminal prosecution because it'll make it safe for other people to do it, then there's nowhere for her to hide.
[42:01.000 --> 42:17.000]  This is epic. Here's the clip.
[42:17.000 --> 42:32.000]  If you look at General Petraeus, he was destroyed over a much lesser event, so I think he's got a very big problem.
[42:32.000 --> 42:48.000]  Any worried Republicans could overplay their hand on this email. That is what it is. It's a terrible thing. There's no reason to do it. And she's got a big problem. Have you talked to Bill Clinton these days, ma'am?
[42:48.000 --> 43:00.000]  All right, that's enough. Now, when we come back, we've got Hillary Clinton making jokes about all this, and we've got another Donald Trump clip even more powerful.

[47:20.000 --> 47:32.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[47:32.000 --> 47:43.000]  So I'm not here saying Donald Trump's an angel. I'm not saying I even trust him, but he's doing things and he's not stupid that will hurt Jeb Bush and hurt Hillary.
[47:43.000 --> 47:51.000]  He was being pretty softball with them before. Now he's attacking them. He is jumping on the bandwagon. I mean, that's just one clip we played.
[47:51.000 --> 48:03.000]  There's like six or seven. He's on national TV this weekend saying she needs to step down. She needs to drop out of the race. They're going to put Biden in against him.
[48:03.000 --> 48:09.000]  Again, that's his statement. Biden is clearly preparing to jump into the race. It certainly appears.
[48:09.000 --> 48:15.000]  And here's Donald Trump saying it would be a miracle if Hillary continues to run. Absolutely.
[48:15.000 --> 48:28.000]  Since when are you caught in Benghazi, caught with classified emails, caught in fast and furious, caught helping persecute the Tea Party with the IRS, all the other scams you're involved in.
[48:28.000 --> 48:34.000]  And then Bernie Sanders comes out and says it's sexist that people don't like Hillary.
[48:34.000 --> 48:48.000]  Hillary's never done anything in her life but working government. Hillary in the Vince Foster episode, the cattle futures, Hillary care, going after our guns, promoting open borders, lying incessantly.
[48:48.000 --> 48:58.000]  We're sick of you. We're sick of the race baiting. And now she's always out saying, you know, women are downtrodden, vote for her. You know, she's the outsider.
[48:58.000 --> 49:08.000]  She'll fight the big corporations when she's bought and paid for them. I mean, Bernie Sanders came out last Monday and said any criticism is sexist.
[49:08.000 --> 49:18.000]  He said there's nothing legitimate about criticism of Hillary. She's a nice person. He likes her. I mean, that's just a sick joke because she's a woman.
[49:18.000 --> 49:31.000]  I'm not supposed to say she's a crook. So let's go to Donald Trump just continues to get more hardcore. And I worry about his safety. Let's go ahead and go to this club.
[49:31.000 --> 49:39.000]  And when Bill Clinton called me, I had already made up my decision, you know, just so you understand. He called me long after I had made a decision and everyone knew I was running.
[49:39.000 --> 49:45.000]  So it wasn't like that. And I think he's very disappointed that I'm running because I'm the one person that's going to beat her.
[49:45.000 --> 49:52.000]  Now, I think she may not be able to run, to be honest, because this whole email thing is a horrible thing. General Petraeus, his life has been destroyed.
[49:52.000 --> 50:01.000]  And he did 5% of what she did. So assuming she's able to run, which would be absolutely to me a miracle at this point, I will beat her.
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  And I don't see the other people that are running against me currently.
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  Regularly call her the worst secretary of state.
[50:07.000 --> 50:11.000]  I think she's the worst secretary of state in the history of our country.
[50:11.000 --> 50:16.000]  Well, it begs the question, I'm a history buff. Who was the worst before her then?
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  Well, I'll tell you who's the worst after her. Kerry, because of what?
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  Who do you believe is the worst before her?
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.000]  I don't want to get into names. I'm insulting Chuck. I'm insulting so many people. I don't want to insult people. I want to be nice to people.
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.000]  I understand it, but it goes to this larger, everything with you is the best or the worst.
[50:30.000 --> 50:31.000]  No, it's not that.
[50:31.000 --> 50:32.000]  There's no nuance.
[50:32.000 --> 50:37.000]  Chuck, during her reign, the entire world fell apart. It fell apart.
[50:37.000 --> 50:42.000]  So the Arab Spring is on her? Is that a fair thing to put the Arab Spring on her?
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.000]  I mean, you could sort of say maybe a little bit, right? I mean, sort of, right?
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.000]  That's a big charge.
[50:47.000 --> 50:48.000]  Look at Kerry.
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.000]  Why do you looks matter to you so much? You talk about it a lot.
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.000]  I don't think they look.
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  Are they matters?
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  Is it going to matter who you hire as a cabinet secretary?
[50:56.000 --> 50:57.000]  No, not at all.
[50:57.000 --> 50:58.000]  OK.
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  No, I don't know why you say. I mean, I own Miss Universe.
[51:00.000 --> 51:07.000]  I own Miss Universe. And of course, the reporter who's a former White House operative is trying
[51:07.000 --> 51:11.000]  to stumping, knowing that even if you're a history buff, when you, when they say who's
[51:11.000 --> 51:18.000]  the next worst secretary of state, knowing you probably can't pull it out of your head,
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  even though you're like, well, back in history, who was a bad one that you think of some of
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  the people that were bad?
[51:23.000 --> 51:29.000]  And so Trump just jumps right to, well, Kerry's even worse. I mean, Trump's really smart.
[51:29.000 --> 51:37.000]  And he dumps his message down, though, for the lowest common denominator.
[51:37.000 --> 51:46.000]  Hillary quarterback, the Arab Spring, they sent Al Qaeda into Libya, into Syria.
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  They gave them the weapons.
[51:48.000 --> 51:49.000]  That's come out in the news.
[51:49.000 --> 51:54.000]  You heard that here first five years ago, four years ago, three years ago, but it's now come
[51:54.000 --> 52:02.000]  out in the news. And if Trump starts talking about that, I'll get behind him.
[52:02.000 --> 52:06.000]  I mean, he's, he's almost got me there now because again, it doesn't matter whether he's
[52:06.000 --> 52:11.000]  sincere or not. What he's doing, what he's, it's like, like if you dump gasoline on somebody
[52:11.000 --> 52:16.000]  and let him on fire, you say, are you sincere about dumping gasoline on me and let me on fire?
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  It doesn't matter. You let him on fire. They're going to burn up.
[52:18.000 --> 52:21.000]  I mean, he's burning Hillary down.
[52:21.000 --> 52:25.000]  He's doing a bunch of other stuff that he's not apologizing.
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  He's saying, make America great again.
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  That tax is about 40% for working class people.
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  It'll increase the tax receipts.
[52:32.000 --> 52:37.000]  He won't let China have these different tariffs on us.
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.000]  It's a tariff when they lower their yarn or the rest of it.
[52:40.000 --> 52:47.000]  I mean, he really is giving us the treatment in his prognosis that would help the country.
[52:47.000 --> 52:53.000]  And I just hope he gives the cover for the other cowards in the Republican party lineup
[52:53.000 --> 53:00.000]  to get out there and get hardcore because Republican candidates always tie their hands
[53:00.000 --> 53:03.000]  behind their backs and try to sound like Democrats during elections.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  That's not what people want.
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  People want lower taxes.
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  They want fair trade.
[53:09.000 --> 53:14.000]  They don't want free trade where it's one sided trade agreements and they want sovereignty back
[53:14.000 --> 53:19.000]  and they want a president who's confident and who doesn't apologize
[53:19.000 --> 53:23.000]  and who doesn't back down and who isn't a coward.
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.000]  I mean, no nation is a nation that doesn't have borders.
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  I've got a stack of news about violent felony legals pouring in.
[53:30.000 --> 53:34.000]  From Eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America, everywhere, just murdering people.
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  Every day I have a stack of it.
[53:36.000 --> 53:39.000]  And they spit it like, oh, you don't like foreigners.
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  I love most foreigners.
[53:41.000 --> 53:47.000]  I love them or hardworking people, but when you can come here and have any idea you want,
[53:47.000 --> 53:51.000]  when you can come to the United States and take on any identity you want,
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  this is where criminals run.
[53:53.000 --> 53:58.000]  Americans run to Mexico because it's the place that you still not have extradition
[53:58.000 --> 54:02.000]  and let, you know, murderers go down there.
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  I mean, nobody debates that.
[54:04.000 --> 54:09.000]  It's not racist to say that Americans run to Mexico, whether they're Hispanic, black, white, whatever.
[54:09.000 --> 54:10.000]  It's a fact.
[54:10.000 --> 54:14.000]  Well, the whole world runs here.
[54:14.000 --> 54:20.000]  And then they won't even let the police departments and sheriff's departments deliver them to ICE to be deported,
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  and they commit crime after crime.
[54:22.000 --> 54:26.000]  Mainly, well, not mainly, but per capita, the largest portion.
[54:26.000 --> 54:31.000]  That'd be more than 50 percent to be mainly, but the largest percentage of those against other immigrants.
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  I mean, I've got a whole bunch of them here.
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  Police chiefs, sheriffs blast ICE over policy.
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  They say freeze violent illegal immigrants.
[54:38.000 --> 54:43.000]  The law actually does not give us the right to place an icehold.
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  That's Fox News up on infowars.com.
[54:45.000 --> 54:46.000]  Here's another one.
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  This one went on Drudge Report Friday.
[54:48.000 --> 54:54.000]  Illegal alien arrested for extremely violent triple homicide in Florida.
[54:54.000 --> 55:02.000]  Police, all homicide scenes are normally violent, but this scene is what we considered unimaginable.
[55:02.000 --> 55:09.000]  And then off the police report, Adon Salazar, writing for infowars.com, breaks it down.
[55:09.000 --> 55:18.000]  He had fled his third world country where he had fled a double decapitation.
[55:18.000 --> 55:19.000]  You can read the whole article.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  It was at Bolivia.
[55:21.000 --> 55:27.000]  And then he got up here and chopped up a bunch of other people, including his cousin.
[55:27.000 --> 55:32.000]  Oh, but see, it doesn't matter he killed his Hispanic cousin and some other Hispanics,
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  because that's not racist because he was Hispanic.
[55:35.000 --> 55:36.000]  That's what I mean.
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  It's just crazy town.
[55:38.000 --> 55:42.000]  The brutal deaths of a grandmother, two teams in Florida earlier this week,
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.000]  have been peddling illegal alien who crossed the Texas-Mexico border.
[55:45.000 --> 55:51.000]  Police at Fort Myers arrested Bolivian national Brian Omar Hayda, 19 Tuesday,
[55:51.000 --> 55:56.000]  driving on the wrong side of the road with no license and blood on his clothes and body.
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  I guess normally you're allowed to drive on the wrong side of the road if you're an illegal alien.
[55:59.000 --> 56:04.000]  The Lee County Sheriff's Office suspects hide and it goes on and it says Bolivia wanted him
[56:04.000 --> 56:10.000]  and he fled for robbing a cell phone store and chopping two people's heads off.
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  I shouldn't laugh.
[56:12.000 --> 56:16.000]  You got like billions of people around the world.
[56:16.000 --> 56:21.000]  And when folks commit a murder in China, they'll put the body in the freezer or bury it
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  and jump on an airplane over here.
[56:23.000 --> 56:29.000]  Or serial killers from Mexico, they come here and then they live in the immigrant neighborhoods
[56:29.000 --> 56:36.000]  if it's Chinese or Russian or Nigerian is a big group of criminals.
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  Not saying Nigerians are criminals, but there's a large criminal contingent
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  and they come and feed on Nigerian communities.
[56:45.000 --> 56:50.000]  I mean, hell, there's a Nigerian mafia in Austin I've learned about operating.
[56:50.000 --> 56:53.000]  And I'm supposed to go, oh, you're another culture.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  Let me bow down here, scam me.
[56:55.000 --> 56:59.000]  I want to bow to you so I can live in a third world country.
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  Hillary said so.
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  It's just crazy.
[57:03.000 --> 57:10.000]  So Donald Trump's telling the truth, so it doesn't matter who he is individually.
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  I mean, here's an analogy.
[57:12.000 --> 57:19.000]  It's like a neon sign, a giant neon sign in Vegas you can see from a mile away.
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.000]  It doesn't matter what's powering the sign, whether it's 100 guys on bicycles or a power plant.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  It's electricity firing that sign up, you can see it.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  It's the message that matters.
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.000]  It is the perception.
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  Because in politics that becomes reality.
[57:31.000 --> 57:36.000]  And there's no way what Donald Trump's doing helps the establishment.
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  I think Donald Trump sees an opportunity.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  I think he's going for it.
[57:40.000 --> 57:41.000]  I think he may be for real.
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.000]  And I think they may blow his airplane or helicopter out of the sky.
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  Second hour coming up, I'm Alex Jones.
[57:46.000 --> 57:49.000]  This is the InfoWare.
[58:16.000 --> 58:19.000]  888-253-3139.

[58:59.000 --> 59:07.000]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[59:07.000 --> 59:19.000]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend. Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.

[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[59:28.000 --> 59:33.000]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[59:52.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  I'm going to give the phone number out to talk all things election 2016, Donald Trump, the economy, world events, abortion.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  Got some really positive news on that front all coming up in the next segment.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  But John Bown cut another report. The full video is at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  Talking about a real solution that we discussed last week with Congressman Walter Jones.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  And that's remove speaker John Boehner from the speaker of the house position.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  This is just as important as getting a good president elected. Here it is.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  Nothing's going to change. I don't know how we ever expect to win.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  John Boehner, the whimpering poster boy for the left-right paradigm and its inter-corporate mechanizations.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  The man that oversees the shameful backdoor deals rampant in the nation's capital that have spiraled out of control
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  and spilled out into the main streets of America needs to be fired.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  Nothing but a lowdown, double-dealing, backstabbing, larcenous, perverted way. Hanging's too good for him. Burning's too good for him.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  Representative Mark Meadows, a Republican from District 11 in North Carolina, introduced House Resolution 385 on July 28th.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  The resolution requires 29 Republican members of the House to vote to vacate the chair. The Republican Speaker of the House, John Boehner, would then need to
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  beg Democrats to save his treasonous skin. This action has never succeeded in the House and has only been attempted once, 105 years ago.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  So why should we fire John Boehner? Well, the Mark Meadows Resolution lists a number of grievances.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  A few of those include Boehner caused the power of Congress to atrophy, thereby making Congress subservient to the executive and judicial branches.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  Boehner is using the power of the office to punish members who vote according to their conscience instead of the will of the Speaker.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  John Boehner used his political ally, Oversight Chairman Jason Chavitz, to punish Meadows by releasing him of his subcommittee chairmanship
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  for voting against the procedural motion to fast-track the TPP. But Chavitz and Boehner couldn't bully Meadows out of his chair after conservatives rallied strong disapproval.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  Boehner is making it abundantly clear. Speak the will of the American people and you will be punished.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  Other grievances include providing for voice votes on consequential and controversial legislation to be taken without notice and with few members present.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  Another grievance reads, John Boehner does not comply with the spirit of the rules which provide that members shall have three days to review legislation before voting.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  The American people can't even see what's in the TPP.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  In the House, the American people's priorities continue to be our priorities.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  Free trade is good for jobs. It's good for America's farmers, manufacturers and small businesses.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  Trade votes are never an easy lifter around here, but Republicans are continuing to work and we're seeing some positive momentum in the right direction.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  And remember when Nancy Pelosi said this...
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  Any of your listeners, whatever state they might be in, if they would call their member of Congress, all of them at home now for the next three, four weeks actually, and call them and ask them to tell the person that answers the phone to remind that Congressman that he or she could join in this resolution to vacate the chair.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  And if we can get enough votes, what will happen, we will have a straight up and down vote on who the next speaker should be to replace John Boehner.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  The H Resolution 385 is now in the Rules Committee.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  The Rules Committee will be the committee that will determine to send this back to the full house, meaning back to the floor of the house for a vote.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  Every member sitting on the floor of the house will have a chance to vote to vacate the chair.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  And then that would mean there would be another vote for the speaker of the house and it would be a new person if that happened.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  So that's where it is.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  Combat that lingering feeling of defeat we Americans have endured daily for years.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  Make your voice heard.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  Call, email, or personally ask your representative to vacate the chair.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  This is your country. It doesn't belong to blubbering traders scum like John Boehner.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  Fire, John Boehner.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  Resist the tyranny.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  This is how our founders set up the system for peaceful revolution.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  John Boehner for Infowars.com.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  Excellent job, John Boehner.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  Absolutely, that video, Fire John Boehner is on Infowars.com. Get it, get it out to your friends and family.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  Are we seeing the beginning of another financial crash?
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  China's central bank which has cut interest rates four times since November to spur growth.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  Just yesterday slashed the value of its currency 1.9% against the dollar.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  The biggest one-day move since the 1990s which caught the markets completely off guard.
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  This move had an immediate impact on the stock market.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  The U.S. stock market responded by dropping nearly 500 points in two days.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  Many fear this is the start of a currency war.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  Regular viewers of the Alex Jones Show and Infowars Nightly News will note that we have been covering this story for many, many years.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  We've had predictions from Gerald Salente, Paul Craig Roberts, Harry Dent and a host of others saying this is the time that the plug is going to be pulled from the economy.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  This is a manufactured crisis to create a global currency by which every transaction can be analyzed and controlled.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  Stay tuned for more reports on the Infowars Nightly News and the Alex Jones Show.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  I was born to bring trouble to wherever I'm at.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  Got the number 13 tattooed on my neck.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  When the ink starts to itch then the black will turn to red.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, the Sunday edition.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  Four to six p.m. Central Standard Time.

[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  Do you think you're still a shill? Doesn't really matter, he's telling the truth.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  What do you think is really happening here?
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  877-789-Alex.

[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  I don't screen your calls, you can mention other stuff afterwards, but I really want to get your take on that.

[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  877-989-Alex.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  877-989-Alex.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  877-989-A.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  877-989-A.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  877-989-A.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:12.500]  They didn't let that stuff out of the recording studios though, in the internet age.
[1:08:12.500 --> 1:08:22.880]  Let me launch my phone system here, log in so I can see your calls coming in, already
[1:08:22.880 --> 1:08:34.280]  see 10 phone lines full, again the number, 877-789-2539.
[1:08:34.280 --> 1:08:44.520]  Coming up, I had a caller on the Friday show call in, and it was basically, you know, don't
[1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:48.560]  talk bad about David Duke.
[1:08:48.560 --> 1:08:54.720]  You ought to have David Duke on the show, and of course, folks probably know who David
[1:08:54.720 --> 1:09:03.320]  Duke is, former Grand Wizard, presidential candidate, Louisiana State rep, and it's
[1:09:03.320 --> 1:09:08.840]  just so low level, when you get a phone call, I'm gonna play a club of Hillary, I'm gonna
[1:09:08.840 --> 1:09:16.120]  play this David Duke club, saying, why you coming up for the Jews, why you coming up
[1:09:16.120 --> 1:09:21.440]  for the Vatican, why you coming up for the Masons, just give me a break, okay, you can
[1:09:21.440 --> 1:09:26.240]  cover what you want, you can be obsessed with what you want, I wanna talk about free market,
[1:09:26.240 --> 1:09:30.440]  I wanna talk about cutting taxes, I wanna talk about being able to choose where your
[1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:33.680]  kids go to school, and just basic freedom.
[1:09:33.680 --> 1:09:40.180]  I'm not into obsessing over what color people are all day, I attack political correctness
[1:09:40.180 --> 1:09:46.080]  for obsessing over color, and trying to make us fight with each other, I see the Democrats
[1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:51.880]  and the Ku Klux Klan as being very close in their policies to each other, totally race
[1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:59.560]  based, they're just forming minority groups into modern Hispanic and black Klan groups,
[1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:05.240]  so they can control them, and we haven't heard back from Duke two days later, I'm sure we
[1:10:05.240 --> 1:10:10.600]  will, because I know he does a lot of interviews, I see him on national TV and the rest of it,
[1:10:10.600 --> 1:10:15.120]  but the reason I decided to talk about this today was, I saw comments on Info Wars, and
[1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:20.640]  then I saw him in emails yesterday, Alex you're a liar, David Duke never said anything bad
[1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:25.880]  about you, blah blah blah, you know, there you go, trying to make yourself a big man,
[1:10:25.880 --> 1:10:29.760]  like I'm a big man that David Duke's talked about me, I mean I've been talked about by
[1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:38.120]  BBC, Nightline, CNN, MSN, I've been bad about by MSNBC probably 500 times that I know of,
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:44.440]  but so these folks that worship David Duke, it's like Jesus talked about me or something,
[1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:52.000]  however I'll have him on the show and I'll give him my worldview, I'm just sick and tired
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:58.280]  of it, because what I said about David Duke was, he's basically like a Mecha Ola Raza
[1:10:58.280 --> 1:11:03.680]  leader, and so I don't get why he gets attacked for being a white supremacist, when all these
[1:11:03.680 --> 1:11:08.120]  other groups are white supremacist or black supremacist or Hispanic supremacist, and the
[1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:15.200]  Democratic Party found out the Ku Klux Klan, so I get he's the designant bad guy who's
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:18.600]  demonized all day, and if you're going to have a bunch of other racist groups, why not
[1:11:18.600 --> 1:11:21.600]  have the white racist groups, because if the other groups are going to be racist and hate
[1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:26.520]  white people, I understand folks has moved to then get into their own separate group,
[1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:32.560]  the point is there's something above that manipulating us into a divide and conquer strategy,
[1:11:32.560 --> 1:11:37.720]  and that's what I'm trying to expose, I mean I can play the clips where Lewis Farrakhan
[1:11:37.720 --> 1:11:43.160]  talks about me, I'm not bragging when I, I think I never even played these clips so
[1:11:43.160 --> 1:11:50.720]  that I get emails going, Lewis Farrakhan never talked about you, or you know, Bill Clinton
[1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:55.560]  never talked about you, or Janet Reno never talked, it isn't about me being talked about,
[1:11:55.560 --> 1:12:01.000]  I don't have to prove myself, I have 20 million listeners a week, I still have weirdos in
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:06.440]  the street, I was on my hiking bike trail today jogging and I'd stopped, I'd gotten
[1:12:06.440 --> 1:12:12.760]  back up to the top of the trail and there were three guys hiking bikers, some were hiking,
[1:12:12.760 --> 1:12:16.160]  some were biking, I thought they were together, and they were like, oh the black helicopter
[1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:19.600]  is going to get you down there, we're surprised you're, you know, you've got the courage to
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:22.880]  go down in there, and I had some other guys who were about black helicopters, I just said
[1:12:22.880 --> 1:12:28.920]  don't you have anything but a cliche, like I'm afraid is why I do this, I'm the one
[1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:33.800]  out front who's bold, and look it's not about talking about myself all day, it's just that
[1:12:33.800 --> 1:12:40.200]  I don't live in this world where I just fit into one of these little definitions that you
[1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:46.720]  can put me in, but shifting gears out of that before we go to your phone calls on the situation
[1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:51.920]  with Donald Trump going after Hillary, and is this the fall of Hillary, let's go ahead
[1:12:51.920 --> 1:12:58.120]  and play this clip from Hillary, incredibly arrogant, hiding in plain view the fact that
[1:12:58.120 --> 1:13:03.920]  she erased her emails, had them professionally wiped, that is obstruction of justice of a
[1:13:03.920 --> 1:13:09.360]  felony crime, which is a felony itself, four to ten years, each count, sixty classified
[1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:19.240]  emails erased, we're talking about, what's sixty times ten years, that's a lot of time,
[1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:28.720]  sixty times ten years, six hundred, let's say she got four years, sixty times four,
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:34.560]  we're talking about a lot of time, so this is a big deal, and then here she is to her
[1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:39.140]  idiot supporters, the same ones we can go out and talk to in Austin Texas, or Mark
[1:13:39.140 --> 1:13:45.160]  Dice, our correspondent at markdice.com can go out and say we want to put all gun owners
[1:13:45.160 --> 1:13:50.680]  in forced labor camps for Hillary, yes they all sign, or eighty percent sign, on average,
[1:13:50.680 --> 1:13:56.560]  we want to execute Christians, yes they'll do anything as long as you say it's for Obama,
[1:13:56.560 --> 1:14:02.880]  it's for Hillary, this is a cult of weirdos, and here they are giggling at her joke about
[1:14:02.880 --> 1:14:09.320]  erasing emails, kind of like Lois Lerner using the IRS to persecute conservatives and libertarians,
[1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:15.840]  that's what Nixon did to a few people and got in trouble for, and Democrats in the past
[1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:21.760]  were concerned about stuff like this, now they think being criminal is cute and funny,
[1:14:21.760 --> 1:14:25.120]  very dangerous group of people, let's go to this clip.
[1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:36.560]  Well, by the way, you may have seen that I recently launched a Snapchat account, I love
[1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:45.480]  it, I love it, those messages disappear all by themselves, and if she puts on this big
[1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:54.280]  act that she's totally confident to her mindless, stupid constituents, black unemployment has
[1:14:54.280 --> 1:15:03.480]  doubled under Obama, blacks on average still worship him, Hillary has the majority of women
[1:15:03.480 --> 1:15:12.240]  supporting her, because she's a woman, whatever, this is identity politics gone to seed, truly
[1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:15.800]  sickening, we're going to go to break, we come back, we're going to play the David
[1:15:15.800 --> 1:15:20.000]  Duke clip, and then because people said David Duke, and we're talking about him, there's
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:24.400]  like five or six clips I found of him doing it, but I'm not going to play them all here,
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:27.400]  and I want to play his clips just to challenge him and tell him what I'm going to challenge
[1:15:27.400 --> 1:15:31.720]  on him up front when he comes on, which I don't think he's a coward, I think he will

[1:20:43.280 --> 1:20:48.880]  then I'll go to alex and Edmonton Robert and Georgia Christian Pennsylvania wild Mormon
[1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:55.160]  in Seattle James in Tennessee Paul in New Mexico alex in New York Laurie in Alabama
[1:20:55.160 --> 1:21:01.040]  Dan Nebraska and many many others interspersed with other important news I haven't covered
[1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:11.520]  yet on the economy North Korea Syria Italy and so many other important fronts including
[1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:17.200]  a volcano becoming active right by nuclear power plant in Japan Japan raises warning
[1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:23.120]  level on volcano not far away from nuclear plant Reuters Japan is like a Godzilla movie
[1:21:23.120 --> 1:21:27.800]  all the stuff that happens over there a bombs getting dropped on it Fukushima blowing up
[1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:32.360]  tsunamis earthquakes there's a reason their houses are built out of paper so why do you
[1:21:32.360 --> 1:21:36.800]  build a bunch of nuclear reactors on fault lines how about they build them on top the
[1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:44.400]  active volcano that would be safer I'm sorry I just at some point it just like a Godzilla
[1:21:44.400 --> 1:21:53.520]  movie here now getting back to what I was saying about David Duke I just mentioned like I don't
[1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:57.120]  get the big deal a few weeks ago about people getting so mad at David Duke you know with
[1:21:57.120 --> 1:22:01.640]  all his stuff is because the Hispanic and black groups are all shining like you know
[1:22:01.640 --> 1:22:06.840]  white supremacist organizations I was being sarcastic but it's just all the same thing
[1:22:06.840 --> 1:22:11.080]  and then a caller called in about you know David Duke's wonderful person and you're basically
[1:22:11.080 --> 1:22:15.680]  might be a race trader because you're not obscene covering all this because it's a way
[1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:22.800]  to trump you no pun intended just to say you're a race trader just to say you work for X and
[1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:27.560]  then whoever says it is better than you well listen I give you a gold star all of you that
[1:22:27.560 --> 1:22:31.960]  hate me and claim I work for this group of that group you are better than me now can
[1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:35.880]  we move forward to get the floor out of the water can we move forward to cut taxes can
[1:22:35.880 --> 1:22:42.040]  we move forward to secure the borders can we just move forward without grandstanding
[1:22:42.040 --> 1:22:46.240]  so I went and search engine David Duke attacks Alex Jones and found a whole bunch of different
[1:22:46.240 --> 1:22:49.480]  places where he did it spent like 30 minutes this morning trying to listen and you know
[1:22:49.480 --> 1:22:55.320]  find us a sync clip and it's always he'll be on a show going good job to you you understand
[1:22:55.320 --> 1:22:58.840]  the problems and how the world works because you agree with me so first it's pat on the
[1:22:58.840 --> 1:23:05.840]  head you you agree with me you're now anointed by you know the grand poobah of white supremacist
[1:23:05.840 --> 1:23:11.840]  supremacy about how the world really works and then he goes into Alex Jones wants to
[1:23:11.840 --> 1:23:15.640]  scare you from being politically involved and tell you you can be put in prison if you
[1:23:15.640 --> 1:23:20.640]  fight back no I say you'll be put in prison or enslave or impoverished if you don't fight
[1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:26.320]  back and you have power and we're at a tipping point but they are persecuting people politically
[1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:31.560]  that their tyrants that discredits them that they're arresting and prosecuting people with
[1:23:31.560 --> 1:23:36.840]  the IRS and other groups like David Duke I don't agree with David Duke's views on a lot
[1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:42.280]  of fronts but I looked at his case on his tax exempt foundation and they'd gone after
[1:23:42.280 --> 1:23:46.040]  now mainline gun groups like they went after David Duke and I was against the prosecution
[1:23:46.040 --> 1:23:51.800]  of David Duke because it was clearly political persecution I don't care if you're some communist
[1:23:51.800 --> 1:23:57.480]  I don't like or David Duke I'm gonna stand up for you if you're being persecuted so he
[1:23:57.480 --> 1:24:04.400]  then straw me and see what Alex Jones would do is read a quote or play a clip of where
[1:24:04.400 --> 1:24:10.000]  I said don't get involved they'll put you in prison but see David Duke didn't do that
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:16.840]  David Duke said I said that when that's the opposite of what I say so I'm gonna give Duke
[1:24:16.840 --> 1:24:21.120]  a chance even play clips on this show when he comes on to show me where I did this in
[1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:25.280]  that but don't sit there and say something if you don't have the meat and potatoes see
[1:24:25.280 --> 1:24:30.480]  I'm gonna play him saying it now I'm gonna show that's what MSNBC does they'll go Alex
[1:24:30.480 --> 1:24:35.920]  Jones influence the Boston bombers don't show where Alex Jones is deeply racist don't show
[1:24:35.920 --> 1:24:44.760]  where Alex Jones once cops to get killed don't show where show me the facts show me the evidence
[1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:50.920]  don't just show me where I work for Israel I mean you know it really sounds funny to
[1:24:50.920 --> 1:24:55.440]  me when I get attacked by a lot of the Israel lobby especially on the left to sit there and
[1:24:55.440 --> 1:25:00.120]  hear you and every other guy like you high horse the fact that I work for Israel let
[1:25:00.120 --> 1:25:03.840]  me tell you who probably works for the Southern Poverty Law Center the ADL about half the white
[1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:08.720]  supremacists out there have been found to look it up how turner the list goes on head
[1:25:08.720 --> 1:25:14.040]  of the Aryan nations so see that's why they all obsess on that all day because well we
[1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:20.320]  know why don't we so let's go ahead now and go to the clip but I'll tell you something
[1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:25.960]  Tom I think in some ways our own movement I'll put that in quotation marks you're responsible
[1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:30.880]  for some of this I'll give you an example and then because you're on the right page
[1:25:30.880 --> 1:25:36.440]  you're in the whole right issue on everything you understand Zionism the Jewish issue and
[1:25:36.440 --> 1:25:41.360]  so forth but you know a lot of people don't and if you look at the movement you got Alex
[1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:46.600]  Jones and you got people like David you get many others out there and you got the so-called
[1:25:46.600 --> 1:25:55.320]  conspiracy and I believe that the conspiracy part of the movement actually hurt our ability
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:26:00.440]  to change things and to build a movement that's going to change the world and resurrect ourselves
[1:26:00.440 --> 1:26:05.200]  you know they constantly tell everyone that FEMA is getting ready to build in concentration
[1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:08.960]  camps and you're going to go into a concentration camp one day that all your rights are going
[1:26:08.960 --> 1:26:11.960]  to be gone and then they find out that you're in a right wing movement you're going to be
[1:26:11.960 --> 1:26:16.600]  in a prison that you're liable to be killed that you're going to lose your job back in
[1:26:16.600 --> 1:26:20.520]  up 10 seconds they say I didn't edit it this is unedited to snip it but the front and end
[1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:26.680]  are cut off but it's unedited clip you were put in jail how many years for a tax free
[1:26:26.680 --> 1:26:34.000]  deal when you clearly didn't do anything wrong the guy on the radio saying I'm a fear monger
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:41.640]  was thrown in prison for his political beliefs that was wrong then we're exposing the FEMA
[1:26:41.640 --> 1:26:47.960]  camps and the COG and the NSA show that they can't sell the rollout of it we're exposing
[1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:57.720]  they want to start a race war so George Soros can't have the race war we're not saying that
[1:26:57.720 --> 1:27:03.600]  oh run to the hills it's all over the elite are the ones digging in we're here trying
[1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:08.840]  to get people to take action see from my perspective if this stuff's happening and it is we need
[1:27:08.840 --> 1:27:13.800]  to stand up if I hear my neighbors houses on fire I go call 911 I try to put the fire
[1:27:13.800 --> 1:27:18.920]  with the water hose whatever I can do try to help my neighbor whatever give them a cup
[1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:24.120]  of coffee while their house burns whatever I don't hear like hey your neighbor hey neighbor
[1:27:24.120 --> 1:27:29.080]  Bob your house on fire well you're a fear monger Alex will the fire shooting out I mean I didn't
[1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:32.880]  burn the house down the house is burning down how is it fear mongering let's go back to the
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:37.600]  club concentration camp one day that all your rights are going to be gone and then they find
[1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:41.040]  out that you're in a right-wing movement you're going to be in a prison that you're liable
[1:27:41.040 --> 1:27:45.520]  to be killed that you're going to lose your job in which they tell us every day that the
[1:27:45.520 --> 1:27:50.560]  the enemy just controls everything and every fast of this is we do not say the enemy controls
[1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:54.800]  everything we lay down so the enemy is in control we point out globalism is shutting
[1:27:54.800 --> 1:28:00.680]  down our jobs unfair deals we want tax cuts we tell people the problem then we give them
[1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:08.120]  a solution David let's go back by the end you know what Thomas really not true most
[1:28:08.120 --> 1:28:13.960]  of their power is a little illusory we are the great majority of our particular nations
[1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:18.280]  and our particular societies and all we had to do is just stand up as a body and I think
[1:28:18.280 --> 1:28:22.680]  most people agree with us but we're going to tip more and more toward more people agreeing
[1:28:22.680 --> 1:28:27.720]  with us as times get worse but if we believe hold on hold on on the pause I thought times
[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:34.280]  weren't getting worse that was fear mongering see I can't wait to get this guy on the radio
[1:28:34.280 --> 1:28:39.840]  by the way David I have a Macedonian world conqueror first name you have a Jewish first
[1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:43.560]  name maybe we look at you of course I'm being sarcastic for the New York Times runs with
[1:28:43.560 --> 1:28:47.200]  that I think we're on with having the name David my dad does is very nice name but David
[1:28:47.200 --> 1:29:00.560]  Duke has a Jewish name you work for you work for Netanyahu I'm joking I'm joking most of

[1:33:56.480 --> 1:34:00.720]  it was martial law we said it was training for domestic takeover the media lied about
[1:34:00.720 --> 1:34:06.400]  that that's why they're so discredited but special ops soldiers use rental trucks to
[1:34:06.400 --> 1:34:13.160]  infiltrate and occupy california town nobody suspected a thing that was jade helm info

[1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:32.720]  are all over the map all i ask is do you think trumps for real or not for real do you think
[1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:36.800]  it's bold that he's saying hillary should step down and is basically a crook it's very
[1:34:36.800 --> 1:34:43.520]  bold and whether he drops out later or not it is really hurting her and that makes me
[1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:49.280]  a big fan because she's a crook and has been bulletproof politically it needs to stop so
[1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:54.640]  alex and ebbenton wants to talk trump wild marmin wants to talk trump christ wants to

[1:35:14.480 --> 1:35:23.200]  right now alex in edmonton where is edmonton i forget where that's at canada that's in
[1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:29.720]  canada right yeah absolutely in alberta welcome so first caller on the u.s. election is from
[1:35:29.720 --> 1:35:38.440]  the great north what is your take on the trump card well just i i'm remembering when uh when
[1:35:38.440 --> 1:35:42.840]  he's when he was bugging obama to show the birth certificate and then they hauled out
[1:35:42.840 --> 1:35:49.080]  that kind of forgery and then the next day obama kills uh been lawn right like it just
[1:35:49.080 --> 1:35:53.640]  seemed so scripted and everything so i don't know if he's for real i really don't i don't
[1:35:53.640 --> 1:36:01.000]  think he is well i mean clearly the the birth certificate was in six layers and was done
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:06.360]  in microsoft word the typewriter font was a computer font so it is a fraud they did a
[1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:11.320]  fraud so obviously so they would divert from the fact that he was from hawaii the son of
[1:36:11.320 --> 1:36:17.120]  a famous communist protographer who he admits he lived with um frank marshall davis that's
[1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:21.680]  why he said in the law review that he was from kenya born there that's why his wife said
[1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:27.040]  that in speeches was so that we would just fight over the fact saying he was from kenya
[1:36:27.040 --> 1:36:31.360]  when the truth it was even worse he was the son of the one of the top kgb agents of the
[1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:37.800]  united states i mean you can't make this stuff up uh so and his mom was you know a porn actress
[1:36:37.800 --> 1:36:43.000]  and the rest of it uh so it's pretty bizarre stuff but i don't think you can blame trump
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:47.720]  for being involved in the birth certificate thing but i hear you i i don't trust him i
[1:36:47.720 --> 1:36:53.160]  i think casinos are a very dirty business that said what do you do when he's promoting
[1:36:53.160 --> 1:36:58.640]  stuff that is common sense and what do you do when he starts saying hillary's a crook
[1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:04.280]  that's a game changer and makes me think he might actually be running for president yeah
[1:37:04.280 --> 1:37:08.160]  yeah he i mean he very well could be just because he's such a narcissist and he wants
[1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:12.360]  the power that's definitely a possibility to you right like it's it's weird it really
[1:37:12.360 --> 1:37:19.360]  is it's just that that's just all i was thinking about he just seems first certificate thing
[1:37:19.360 --> 1:37:24.040]  the like you know bug in obama bug in obama and then it was just like when rumsel said
[1:37:24.040 --> 1:37:27.600]  all that money was missing and then the next day the plane had that side of the pentagon
[1:37:27.600 --> 1:37:31.960]  right like it's just the way it comes out in the media cycle it just everything just
[1:37:31.960 --> 1:37:37.880]  seems so scripted rumsel cbs news 2.2 billion's missing or excuse me 2.2 trillion's missing
[1:37:37.880 --> 1:37:44.360]  boom uh 911 happens the next day great point yeah i don't trust trump i am i am impressed
[1:37:44.360 --> 1:37:49.640]  uh and it doesn't look fake to me now and that's why i say i may be wrong that i'm
[1:37:49.640 --> 1:37:54.800]  now gone from 50 50 to like 60 40 and one thing's for sure this is not going to be
[1:37:54.800 --> 1:38:01.080]  a boring election i mean this is popcorn time but we're eating popcorn in our own our own
[1:38:01.080 --> 1:38:05.640]  destruction if this stuff goes wrong thank you alex a great point from canada christin
[1:38:05.640 --> 1:38:12.760]  pennsylvania chris you're on the air go ahead how you doing alex so love live live for liberty
[1:38:12.760 --> 1:38:16.280]  uh i just want to say i just want to give you a quick plug real quick your sunday show is very
[1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:20.120]  powerful if you're a info war subscriber and you listen during the week and you're not
[1:38:20.120 --> 1:38:25.400]  listening to sunday you're missing out uh the point i wanted to make about trump it's it's
[1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:28.760]  like you've been saying that you'll know him by their fruits and i think we're coming to a point
[1:38:28.760 --> 1:38:32.840]  in time where we're really going to see the fruit of trump come to bear now what do we know about
[1:38:32.840 --> 1:38:39.000]  hillary hillary's a criminal okay what do all criminals do they play damage control so it's
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:43.160]  going to crystallize right in front of our face because what's going to happen is hillary's going
[1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:48.760]  to play damage control on this now if you see an attack from the hillary clamp that attacks
[1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:55.160]  trump on his character then you know he's the real deal as she pits he pats he puts around it
[1:38:55.160 --> 1:39:00.840]  and tries to keep it buddy buddy then you know that it's all going to come to bear real soon i
[1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:04.360]  would be surprised if we didn't see the fruit in the next two weeks that we're going to see whether
[1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:10.040]  or not if trump is the real deal or not well she's been attacking him on the megan kelly situation
[1:39:10.040 --> 1:39:15.240]  and other issues that's megan kelly that's what you know that's what the mainstream media wanted
[1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:19.160]  that's what fox wanted they wanted sure you're right even if it sounds mean that is a patty cake
[1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:25.000]  issue exactly it's a patty cake issue but if they start going back and forth on the email scandal
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:28.920]  it's going to be some fireworks and then we'll know by the fruit that he's with a real deal that
[1:39:28.920 --> 1:39:34.200]  well we'll know he's for real if his helicopter blows up oh excuse me we'll know he's for real
[1:39:34.200 --> 1:39:39.000]  if they blow his airplane up well that's another thing too i don't think if i don't think they'll
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:43.560]  blow his airplane up that the reason being is if you were to kill trump right now it's kind of like
[1:39:43.560 --> 1:39:49.160]  if obama was to kill right now god forbid everything that he stands on would just be crystallized
[1:39:49.160 --> 1:39:53.560]  and everybody would just flock over to him that's the only thing that could save obama's agenda would
[1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:58.360]  be for somebody to shoot him the last thing we want is anything to happen to obama absolutely we
[1:39:58.360 --> 1:40:03.720]  and and i think on the flip side of the coin the last thing the democrats would want or liberals in
[1:40:03.720 --> 1:40:09.080]  general would want is that his helicopter blows out the sky because so they're going to try to
[1:40:09.080 --> 1:40:15.960]  assassinate his credibility not his person exactly once you see they assassinate his character and
[1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:20.280]  things of his past they might try to judge up that's how you know by his fruit sees real that's
[1:40:20.280 --> 1:40:25.960]  and that's all right great caller great points let's take one from robert on a candidate i like
[1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:30.520]  who's talked about margaret singer in the nazis and the targeting of black people uh
[1:40:30.520 --> 1:40:35.560]  ben karson but this caller it looks like says that he has a position on forced inoculations
[1:40:35.560 --> 1:40:40.280]  i hope karson isn't for that uh let's find out right now because i like karson i like rand paul
[1:40:40.280 --> 1:40:45.320]  the best but i like karson what i've seen uh i'd love to elect a black president who was a patriot
[1:40:45.320 --> 1:40:50.200]  not a traitor uh that would bring real unity in this country uh robert in georgia what's your take
[1:40:50.200 --> 1:40:56.760]  on karson yeah i i mean again i just want to preface it by saying i don't have any problem
[1:40:56.760 --> 1:41:04.680]  with the color or gender if they were libertarian constitutionalists and yeah i did like ben karson
[1:41:04.680 --> 1:41:12.840]  too but i did find out last week that he he is against or he's poor mandatory vaccinations
[1:41:12.840 --> 1:41:16.760]  well that's a that i don't like him i mean i'll tell you right there it just shows he's stupid
[1:41:16.760 --> 1:41:20.920]  and i don't think he's stupid he comes off as sincere he wants to cut taxes he's against
[1:41:20.920 --> 1:41:27.960]  aborting the babies uh but man i mean forced inoculations that's tyranny yeah yeah i figured
[1:41:27.960 --> 1:41:32.760]  you in where did you where did guys will you search in there ben karson on inoculations
[1:41:32.760 --> 1:41:37.400]  where did you see him say that i mean i believe you but where'd you see it yeah right bark news
[1:41:37.400 --> 1:41:43.480]  and newsmax.com but when you do a google there's a number of them that'll pull up i think cnn
[1:41:43.480 --> 1:41:47.560]  reported on it as well well i missed that yeah there it has been karson no one has the right
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:51.720]  to refuse mandatory vaccinations wow what a tyrant because i mean i'll tell you right now
[1:41:52.600 --> 1:41:56.840]  we've never had forced inoculation for a reason there's been so many mishaps so many illnesses
[1:41:56.840 --> 1:42:00.760]  so many side effects they have hundreds of vaccines they want to make mandatory now
[1:42:00.760 --> 1:42:04.600]  you know when i was a kid it was like five or six now it's 40 something they got another 50 they
[1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:10.200]  want to get approved uh these aren't your mama's vaccines either they're so sophisticated and

[1:42:15.560 --> 1:42:21.480]  man that is just outrageous that he would come out and say that yeah yeah and again i'm not

[1:48:30.040 --> 1:48:35.480]  going to give each person about a minute wild mormon in seattle what's your take on trump
[1:48:35.480 --> 1:48:42.840]  well uh happy hempfest alex well i say now more than ever that he has to be a show the
[1:48:42.840 --> 1:48:51.080]  way i see it uh he's planned his plan a was to scuttle rand paul and plan b is if he does
[1:48:51.080 --> 1:48:58.040]  actually get elected then to pardon whoever he raised emails that's my view on it so you
[1:48:58.040 --> 1:49:02.920]  don't trust him no matter what which i'm not blaming you was i mean he owns casinos he's got issues
[1:49:02.920 --> 1:49:09.080]  i hear what you're saying but usually the clinton's are in power man they run obama they they've
[1:49:09.080 --> 1:49:13.640]  got the blackmail they've got the files they've been in there for decades they don't want to be
[1:49:13.640 --> 1:49:19.560]  destroyed uh i mean what he's doing uh you know joining the bandwagon i don't see that as a sign
[1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:24.920]  of him being an operative well here's the thing we're entering the end game they're out to take
[1:49:24.920 --> 1:49:29.880]  us all out it really doesn't matter if he shows his teeth now or not and matter of fact if you
[1:49:29.880 --> 1:49:34.600]  look at the way the satanists do they're just rubbing our noses in it and if he does get in
[1:49:34.600 --> 1:49:39.320]  like i said he pardons people and no matter what he doesn't want to be president he could tell
[1:49:39.320 --> 1:49:45.400]  because uh it wasn't until biden decided to get him when hillary started to look untenable
[1:49:45.960 --> 1:49:51.000]  then he started showing his teeth sure as soon as they look like everybody turned against her
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:54.600]  and it was safe to jump and he jumped in but i understand that because this is a mafia you're
[1:49:54.600 --> 1:49:59.800]  dealing with um well we're all going to find out i hear you at good points makes me think that's why
[1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:04.360]  i wanted to take the calls and get your perspective and kind of crowdsource the knowledge of the people
[1:50:07.640 --> 1:50:11.000]  we're going to find out though very very very very soon what's really going on here
[1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:19.000]  let's go to who's up next on this subject let's go to lori in alabama thanks for holding
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:25.720]  you're on the air you think trumps for real hey alex thanks for taking my call at first
[1:50:25.720 --> 1:50:31.240]  i thought this situation was going to be like a ross burrow situation but the more that i've
[1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:37.880]  listened to him and just let his heart speak he doesn't talk from a teleprompter he's for real
[1:50:37.880 --> 1:50:43.400]  he's in this to win he's a businessman he wants to do what's right for the country he wants to
[1:50:43.400 --> 1:50:49.240]  make america great again and i believe the man's for real well i tell you if he doesn't deliver if
[1:50:49.240 --> 1:50:56.200]  he ends up getting elected or he drops out he's in big trouble no i hear you um i've seen donald
[1:50:56.200 --> 1:51:00.840]  trump on tv i followed him some and he usually is like like a goofball you can tell when he's acting
[1:51:00.840 --> 1:51:07.160]  he looks like he's serious and he looks a little bit not so much freaked out but like he's committed
[1:51:07.160 --> 1:51:15.240]  and that something's going on i'm not sure um i'm not sure but again we're going to find out i
[1:51:15.240 --> 1:51:21.560]  appreciate your call anything else hey uh thanks for thank you thanks for speaking up against this
[1:51:21.560 --> 1:51:27.400]  just what evil was oh yeah well the pope is calling for world government carbon taxes that'll kill
[1:51:27.400 --> 1:51:32.840]  a billion people and he says catholic shouldn't be worried about abortion anymore so i'm sorry i'm
[1:51:32.840 --> 1:51:37.080]  not going to stand against the children i have to criticize this new pope thank you i'm not catholic
[1:51:37.080 --> 1:51:41.560]  i don't ever bash catholics a lot of good catholic people other pups fought against abortion i just
[1:51:41.560 --> 1:51:46.280]  i just don't understand it uh so i gotta stand against it thank you laury uh let's go another
[1:51:46.280 --> 1:51:53.400]  caller here on donald trump uh let's talk to ronnie in texas ronnie you're on the year sir thank
[1:51:53.400 --> 1:52:01.000]  you much uh trump does say uh refreshingly rare political all this again i believe really again
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:06.760]  agreeing with your previous caller that it's all part of the hijack dr rand paul cabal you know
[1:52:06.760 --> 1:52:13.160]  the fact that we have every but potential republican candidate running now is not unrelated to this
[1:52:13.160 --> 1:52:18.600]  long-term scheme to sabotage dr rand paul no i know rand paul's for real and he's busy in Haiti
[1:52:18.600 --> 1:52:24.200]  right now doing free eye surgery uh you know a little black kids and getting no attention
[1:52:24.200 --> 1:52:29.160]  well everybody else is eating corn dogs at the you know state fair and trumps landing in his
[1:52:29.160 --> 1:52:36.040]  helicopter still on the show i get it um i just wish rand would get more hardcore on the imploded
[1:52:36.040 --> 1:52:40.520]  borders because if he did that he'd be more popular plus his constitutional i mean it's a
[1:52:40.520 --> 1:52:45.960]  libertarian position to not give people free anchor babies and and free welfare to come here
[1:52:45.960 --> 1:52:51.320]  nobody else does it it's political suicide i appreciate your call i do support rand paul
[1:52:52.120 --> 1:52:59.800]  he's gone from number one to like number three or four because he's got advisors that have allowed
[1:52:59.800 --> 1:53:05.960]  trump to trump him and he's got advisors telling him to attack trump when he should be neutral on it
[1:53:05.960 --> 1:53:10.600]  he should be out trumping trump and i say that because i care about rand paul and know he's for
[1:53:10.600 --> 1:53:15.400]  real and know he'd make a great president then maybe he could have trump as the secretary of uh
[1:53:16.120 --> 1:53:22.360]  of uh the treasury or something thank you so much for that call let's talk about rand paul some
[1:53:22.360 --> 1:53:28.840]  paul into mexico let's talk about rand paul you're on the air yeah i think i got a campaign slogan
[1:53:28.840 --> 1:53:35.640]  for rand paul i don't pay for favors i asked for favors you know in that first debate when chris
[1:53:35.640 --> 1:53:45.160]  christie uh blasted paul for uh for putting up uh the i were 30 minutes after the the whatever he
[1:53:45.160 --> 1:53:50.040]  said something about 30 minutes he posted to his website uh well this is the way to take down chris
[1:53:50.040 --> 1:53:56.440]  christie because um you know so anyways i don't know if you understand what i know but i'm ignorant
[1:53:56.440 --> 1:54:05.080]  of it but i mean i watch the debate but um look rand paul needs to get nationalistic and populistic
[1:54:05.080 --> 1:54:09.240]  and not just sit there and be a policy wonk debating the finer intricacies of an iran deal
[1:54:09.880 --> 1:54:14.920]  people have been dumbed down on average he needs to reach out to those people he's got
[1:54:14.920 --> 1:54:19.960]  intellectual libertarians and conservative supporting him he needs to you know really get
[1:54:19.960 --> 1:54:24.920]  out there and just dominate with incendiary comments that's what it takes because we're in an
[1:54:24.920 --> 1:54:31.880]  incendiary situation we're in an extreme situation thank you paul let's go ahead and talk to dan
[1:54:31.880 --> 1:54:37.960]  and nebraska dan you're on the air thanks for holding very much alex um i had uh i think
[1:54:37.960 --> 1:54:42.280]  trump is a narcissist but i also wanted to talk to you about reverend pinkney and benton harbour
[1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:48.360]  who's being held in prison for uh first amendment exercising his first amendment rights now on on
[1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:53.960]  trump i i think that uh he's doing a lot of good because he's got the gop fighting against each other
[1:54:53.960 --> 1:54:59.320]  so i think that's really good i think he's going to do a lot of damage to both republicans and
[1:54:59.320 --> 1:55:05.720]  hillary clinton before he's done so that's that's all right with me um yeah i mean i don't see him
[1:55:05.720 --> 1:55:11.320]  helping the democrats right now is all i'm saying i don't i don't see it right now i wonderful see
[1:55:11.320 --> 1:55:15.960]  it in the future but i i like that he's taking shots at hillary clinton i tell you about uh
[1:55:15.960 --> 1:55:22.040]  reverend pinkney and benton harbour so who is this this is um uh uh baptist minister he was
[1:55:22.040 --> 1:55:27.800]  organizing um against uh the private privatization of public land and benton harbour
[1:55:27.800 --> 1:55:31.640]  he was working against a whirlpool cooperation in the upton family there okay what happened
[1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:39.640]  it while he was arrested for uh voter fraud they they uh uh said that he falsified information on a
[1:55:39.640 --> 1:55:45.640]  on a ballot petition but this gentleman's been working against uh he will look into it we'll
[1:55:45.640 --> 1:55:51.960]  look into it i promise you dan thank you okay let's go ahead and talk to uh michael michael
[1:55:51.960 --> 1:56:01.800]  in oregon go ahead donald trump donald trump is a narcissist and a uh a businessman mafia i mean
[1:56:01.800 --> 1:56:08.120]  he works at very high levels of business now he's like a mobster he's a tough guy in in business
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:12.040]  now what does that mean for us it could be a good thing i don't think for a minute he cares about
[1:56:12.040 --> 1:56:18.200]  the general public but where he sees eugenicist elites are destroying humanity he can see that
[1:56:18.200 --> 1:56:23.320]  would bring down his financial empire yes power he has would diminish so as a self-interested
[1:56:23.320 --> 1:56:28.280]  narcissist he would want to stop that well but i mean listen i think they overuse this
[1:56:28.280 --> 1:56:33.880]  narcissist thing in psychology and say everybody's a narcissist whatever happened to male confidence
[1:56:33.880 --> 1:56:39.880]  in dominance that's normal for the species and so to sit i mean show me someone who's successful
[1:56:39.880 --> 1:56:46.040]  who doesn't have a little bit of the hootspa bravada whatever you call it uh but i hear you
[1:56:46.040 --> 1:56:52.840]  uh and you know uh what you have is fake narcissists that live in their mother's basements and are
[1:56:52.840 --> 1:56:57.960]  delusional about being successful and play video games all day i want to find real people
[1:56:58.520 --> 1:57:03.800]  that that want to empower america and the world and and i agree with you that i think that may
[1:57:03.800 --> 1:57:08.840]  be what's happening with donald trump i absolutely agree with you where do you think all this is
[1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:15.480]  going well unfortunately um i think donald trump is a puppet the same way that isis is a puppet
[1:57:15.480 --> 1:57:20.280]  basically his ego is being played off of by the elite so so he's real and sincere but they still
[1:57:20.280 --> 1:57:24.040]  have a plan for him down the road and i think that maybe what's happening is what the media started
[1:57:24.040 --> 1:57:29.000]  promoting him even as they attacked him but that may blow up in their face because the best laid
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:35.560]  plans of mice and men often go awry i'm sorry to alex james and others will be back tomorrow
[1:57:35.560 --> 1:57:41.880]  lord willing 11 a.m central with a weekday edition of the info war great job with the crew
