[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  Music
[00:07.000 --> 00:14.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:14.000 --> 00:19.000]  Music
[00:19.000 --> 00:25.000]  Somehow this ominous music just isn't ominous enough.
[00:25.000 --> 00:35.000]  Well, yesterday I went pretty wild on air.
[00:35.000 --> 00:41.000]  Because you're supposed to get upset and get out of your comfort zone and things like this are going on.
[00:41.000 --> 00:48.000]  Wrath of God into the world, Mark of the Beast type stuff, all of it actually now unfolding for real.
[00:48.000 --> 01:03.000]  And run by psychotic pedophile cultists that established a medical world government society headed up by David Rockefeller,
[01:03.000 --> 01:13.000]  Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Warren Buffett, Ted Turner,
[01:13.000 --> 01:20.000]  and Honchoed as the manager by Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:20.000 --> 01:29.000]  And because we've been at the tip of the spear, as loyal humans, loyal to life, liberty and freedom,
[01:29.000 --> 01:45.000]  I have Bill Gates and a consortium of others who signed on with Bloomberg and the DNC to run these giant operations against info wars to shut us down.
[01:45.000 --> 01:54.000]  And to order federal bureaucrats to somehow put me in jail or they themselves will lose their jobs.
[01:54.000 --> 02:02.000]  That doesn't make me want to back down. That makes me want to fight even harder, but it really makes me sad that our country is this corrupt.
[02:02.000 --> 02:10.000]  But there's something very heartening. In fact, you guys pull out of your stay stack on Bill Gates's Twitter on his Instagram.
[02:10.000 --> 02:16.000]  99% of people say we know you're a monster and we hate your stinking guts.
[02:16.000 --> 02:25.000]  And we know that you run all the big institutes and the big foundations and that you are a anti human exterminist.
[02:25.000 --> 02:32.000]  And then everybody is just everywhere digging into him and how he funds Fauci and bricks and her daughter and Fauci's family and just their all work for him.
[02:32.000 --> 02:45.000]  And the world is saying, who is this creepy little dude that's been mainly behind the scenes except when he talks about killing old people and sterilizing people and how much he loves getting rid of black people.
[02:45.000 --> 02:50.000]  But now he's here telling you to stay in your house and that your Bill of Rights and Constitution is all gone.
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.000]  So they may get me.
[02:55.000 --> 03:05.000]  And I told you that last week, I mean, I was told that if I don't stop, that they will put me in prison.
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  They don't want to kill me because that turned me into a martyr.
[03:08.000 --> 03:17.000]  They said, you're going to shut up right now and you're going to behave like a good boy or we're going to have you indicted and you can now see that all over the news.
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  Well, guess what?
[03:22.000 --> 03:31.000]  I aborted a lot of my children when I was younger and I repented of it and I swore before God that I was going to fight for life on this planet if I could be forgiven.
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  And so I don't care what you do to me.
[03:33.000 --> 03:40.000]  In fact, I'm going to fight you 10 times harder now.
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  By the way, you know what COVID-19 is.
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  He named it.
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  They had a tabletop exercise five months ago.
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  It is certificate of vaccination ID.
[03:50.000 --> 03:58.000]  And Fauci has now announced
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.000]  that they are going to have a medical ID by next year if you'd be able to leave your home.
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.000]  That is total martial law.
[04:04.000 --> 04:05.000]  No more medical privacy.
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  Just absolute takeover.
[04:07.000 --> 04:14.000]  By the way, when I tell you that they had a consortium of billionaires put money into an account, they pay the media when they attack me.
[04:14.000 --> 04:15.000]  They get paid.
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  Gage, when he's on these shows, pays to be on them.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.000]  That's on record.
[04:19.000 --> 04:20.000]  Look it up.
[04:20.000 --> 04:21.000]  He has entertainment shows.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  He funds where he's the hero as well, like the good doctor and pandemic.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  I had to sign on disclosures about this.
[04:31.000 --> 04:32.000]  Okay.
[04:32.000 --> 04:33.000]  NDC.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  You have to understand.
[04:35.000 --> 04:45.000]  We've been in meetings in DC with, let's just say, some of the richest people in the world, one of which did not opt in to this consortium.
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.000]  That's how I know about it.
[04:46.000 --> 04:47.000]  Okay.
[04:47.000 --> 04:48.000]  And I had to sign on disclosures.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  I'm not going to violate that, but that's how we know all this.
[04:50.000 --> 04:51.000]  Okay.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  So I want you to know I'm standing up.
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  I need your support.
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  Go ahead and sign.
[04:58.000 --> 05:05.680]  something huge is happening all over the United States on ABC CBS NBC on local
[05:05.680 --> 05:09.680]  Fox affiliates but only local ones they're having medical doctors on who
[05:09.680 --> 05:14.560]  successfully treated their patients with 100% recovery rates with hydroxy
[05:14.560 --> 05:19.680]  chloroquine but you've got to have the zinc this is a known fact but national
[05:19.680 --> 05:25.120]  news other than Fox will not carry it and when Tucker Carlson Laura Ingram and
[05:25.120 --> 05:28.280]  Sean Hannity covered it and had medical doctors talk about it they got
[05:28.280 --> 05:32.740]  demonized and Fox had them basically shut up but they've been vindicated info
[05:32.740 --> 05:37.000]  wars has been vindicated we were saying at first with experts we had on air we
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.160]  got attacked nationally and they said take us off the air Google took our
[05:41.160 --> 05:45.720]  app away saying that we were putting out fake cures for staying hydroxy
[05:45.720 --> 05:49.760]  chloroquine zinc and CPAC when all we were doing was reporting with medical
[05:49.760 --> 05:53.800]  journals were saying big pharma and the globalist one you sick and dead and they
[05:53.800 --> 05:58.320]  don't want you to boost your immune system screw them
[06:11.000 --> 06:21.480]  what do you say when it's over don't know if I should say anything coming down
[06:21.480 --> 06:28.320]  the wire now folks one day we're rolling in the global overnight all the hard
[06:28.320 --> 06:33.560]  fought liberties are gone next thing you know we take and the market the beast
[06:33.560 --> 06:37.720]  was announced still I think that's just what we told you would do the
[06:37.720 --> 06:43.600]  announcement closest thing the anti-crash on this planet is Bill Gates
[06:43.600 --> 06:52.720]  they should be so easy to beat creepy evil medical officer of the new world
[06:52.720 --> 07:06.000]  order vacations with Jeffrey Epstein doesn't even have a bachelor's degree
[07:06.000 --> 07:13.360]  but runs around policing everyone on the internet and having the media attack
[07:13.360 --> 07:18.080]  the president when he says zinc the doctors say really helps you not get
[07:18.080 --> 07:24.400]  COVID-19 or vitamin D3 or vitamin K here's Politico just printed this off
[07:24.400 --> 07:32.880]  about 10 minutes ago and look at the ad right here at the top of Politico K2 D3
[07:32.880 --> 07:47.000]  what is our winter son K2 D3 and my point is is that when we do it we're the
[07:47.000 --> 07:56.120]  evil evil people but when they do it's good but I've even seen articles where
[07:56.120 --> 08:01.520]  they're now having the FDA go after people that say take vitamin D3 to boost
[08:01.520 --> 08:07.800]  your immunity when that's on the NIH website because folks the establishment
[08:07.800 --> 08:13.560]  does not want the people healthy they do not want you to know that most the time
[08:13.560 --> 08:17.960]  that you get colds or the flu you are debilitated and you have major
[08:17.960 --> 08:26.040]  deficiencies and that's what makes me so angry about this is that these guys are
[08:26.040 --> 08:32.640]  completely transparent what they're doing but look what Fauci says right here
[08:32.640 --> 08:43.480]  Fauci coronavirus immunity cards for Americans are being discussed now I
[08:43.480 --> 08:47.840]  told you nine weeks ago that as this rolled out monkey see monkey do they'd
[08:47.840 --> 08:52.480]  have the left of cities and counties locked down set the president say the
[08:52.480 --> 08:59.680]  president he doesn't lock everything down is causing all the death but then
[08:59.680 --> 09:03.320]  when he does lock it down and we have a great depression which is probably gonna
[09:03.320 --> 09:08.480]  happen now regardless we've gone too long over a month that's gonna be his
[09:08.480 --> 09:12.800]  fault and now the Democrats are proposing canceling the election and
[09:12.800 --> 09:17.920]  moving it back a year but then COVID's gonna hit the next year and then they're
[09:17.920 --> 09:25.280]  gonna call for a congressional emergency commission and a board that rules
[09:25.280 --> 09:29.320]  because Trump isn't legitimate because they had to cancel the election and they
[09:29.320 --> 09:33.520]  think by then they would have exhausted him and found a way to get rid of him
[09:33.520 --> 09:38.120]  they don't want him vindicated by a second election in 206 days and they're
[09:38.120 --> 09:42.920]  not gonna let it happen unless Trump boldly acts to shut them down by just
[09:42.920 --> 09:46.240]  exposing that they work for the communist Chinese with a globalist
[09:46.240 --> 09:50.320]  consortium against this country and they're not Americans they are globalist
[09:50.320 --> 09:55.960]  the good news is you see the Pentagon and the Republican leadership coming out
[09:55.960 --> 10:00.400]  and saying China is running the Democratic Party most of the senators
[10:00.400 --> 10:04.920]  have Chinese spies working in their offices as part of agreements with them
[10:04.920 --> 10:09.400]  to be paid off you're wondering why Reddit attacks the president the
[10:09.400 --> 10:13.880]  textures truly China bought it they didn't invest a hundred million than
[10:13.880 --> 10:21.120]  another 500 million they bought it they run it the military of China actually
[10:21.120 --> 10:27.080]  moderates it now and if you go on there they call for Trump's arrest my arrest
[10:27.080 --> 10:37.960]  this is outrageous of the big eight Hollywood movie houses six are owned by
[10:37.960 --> 10:48.760]  the chai cops COVID-19 ladies and gentlemen is the certificate of
[10:48.760 --> 10:59.720]  vaccination ID program being carried out against humans on this planet and once
[10:59.720 --> 11:10.160]  they get you to take that card that's a global UN run system that will then
[11:10.160 --> 11:15.280]  track everything you do in a lifetime one of my friends wears one of those
[11:15.280 --> 11:20.080]  rings so he knows what his heart rate is over the day how much he does it's
[11:20.080 --> 11:25.600]  synced to a computer and he got a message saying hey we're gonna start
[11:25.600 --> 11:30.280]  reporting everybody in their temperatures on this ring to the COVID-19
[11:30.280 --> 11:38.440]  task force well iPhones for at least ten years track all of that as well off the
[11:38.440 --> 11:41.800]  magnetic waves coming off your body that's how advanced this military
[11:41.800 --> 11:49.840]  technology is so the robots are already all around you they're all spying on you
[11:49.840 --> 11:55.580]  the assistance all of it and this is a anti-human takeover a revolution against
[11:55.580 --> 11:59.640]  civilization and society and all the fools that think you're gonna go along
[11:59.640 --> 12:04.200]  with this have to understand you're being taken from a free system into a real
[12:04.200 --> 12:11.840]  dystopic future that's already here the future is not coming it's here and as you
[12:11.840 --> 12:18.680]  notice it's moving very very quickly so Fauci comes out on the clip next segment
[12:18.680 --> 12:22.800]  and he says yeah we're discussing having this ID that means you've had the
[12:22.800 --> 12:28.280]  vaccines to show that you have immunity now remember I told you nine ten weeks
[12:28.280 --> 12:32.880]  ago this will be the plan you'll have apps on your phones you'll have to have
[12:32.880 --> 12:37.560]  a vaccine and it's gonna be big corporations and it's gonna be grocery
[12:37.560 --> 12:43.920]  stores and it's going to be the airlines the corporations that carry this out
[12:43.920 --> 12:49.500]  and they're gonna say if you don't have the ID it's digital if we put on your
[12:49.500 --> 12:53.600]  phone or then in a tattoo injected into you they've now announced officially
[12:53.600 --> 12:57.640]  that's the plan because there'll be problems with the IDs getting stolen of
[12:57.640 --> 13:04.320]  course and all this has been wargamed out and prepared I remember reading
[13:04.320 --> 13:12.880]  Wash Tech 23 years ago when they put out that weekly tech magazine to wash and
[13:12.880 --> 13:19.680]  post it and in it they had a CIA futurist from the Pentagon and they said we're
[13:19.680 --> 13:24.640]  promoting body piercings and tattoos because by the year 2020 we're gonna
[13:24.640 --> 13:29.000]  find that article we want to roll out an implantable medical ID chip for
[13:29.000 --> 13:35.480]  everyone's security they're following an exact evil plan a lot of soldiers got
[13:35.480 --> 13:42.880]  microchips 20 plus years ago they were told it was national security I have
[13:42.880 --> 13:50.160]  we's out now he's been 35 years in the army a cousin who told me about a
[13:50.160 --> 13:57.160]  meeting of officers in Texas and he said no you tell people I told you that but
[13:57.160 --> 14:02.240]  just don't say my name I talked about it a month later and even say it was my
[14:02.240 --> 14:05.880]  cousin they called him in because they already had everything under AI surveillance
[14:05.880 --> 14:12.640]  there and said you're not gonna get promoted as much because you did that
[14:12.640 --> 14:20.760]  keep your mouth shut so let's understand we've never been in Kansas we're on
[14:20.760 --> 14:27.880]  planet Earth ladies and gentlemen and we're certainly not in Kansas anymore and
[14:27.880 --> 14:38.440]  I signed a non-disclosure agreement about a year and a half ago up in DC to go
[14:38.440 --> 14:49.840]  ahead and meet with a certain political party and it was a long meetings
[14:49.840 --> 15:00.880]  multiple days and you see what's going on right now don't you that they have a
[15:00.880 --> 15:05.000]  consortium of billionaires they don't just kitty up to attack me they do it a
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.840]  lot of folks but I'm one of the main targets I mean I'm literally like second
[15:08.840 --> 15:16.080]  only to Trump and there's USA today you will get chipped eventually say they're
[15:16.080 --> 15:24.520]  just getting you ready that was last year a couple years ago and you know they

[15:35.880 --> 15:43.480]  don't criticize the sexualization of kids or we will put your ass in prison and

[17:18.000 --> 17:21.360]  price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the
[17:21.360 --> 17:24.840]  east bank of the Mississippi because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of
[17:24.840 --> 17:28.480]  our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the
[17:28.480 --> 17:31.400]  warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem
[17:31.400 --> 17:35.480]  unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory so here's what you
[17:35.480 --> 17:39.960]  should do right now check out the PPX microgrid system at my own power grid

[18:02.360 --> 18:08.600]  beginning to attack 5g and other cell tower systems it's on record that these
[18:08.600 --> 18:14.520]  systems cause massive increases of cancer they're bombarding us with a weapon
[18:14.520 --> 18:19.280]  system and they're surveilling us now I'm not encouraging people to go out and
[18:19.280 --> 18:23.400]  burn these things down or destroy them but what I'm saying is this when you
[18:23.400 --> 18:28.120]  attack people with electromagnetic radiation and with microwaves and when
[18:28.120 --> 18:32.040]  the public sees the effects when they put them on top schools and they have huge
[18:32.040 --> 18:37.440]  cancer clusters the globalists are going to have major pushback and now Google is
[18:37.440 --> 18:42.540]  banning anybody that criticizes 5g in any way they have truly proven that they
[18:42.540 --> 18:46.960]  are the definition of anti-human evil and they've thrown in with the chai comms
[18:46.960 --> 18:51.720]  who support absolute tyranny on levels never before seen but the human
[18:51.720 --> 18:56.820]  rebellion against the technocracy has begun and will not be stopped join the
[18:56.820 --> 19:01.360]  rebellion now one of our best-selling products is living defense and it's been
[19:01.360 --> 19:05.280]  sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that
[19:05.280 --> 19:08.600]  are organic we've got a limited supply right now but it's selling out fast and
[19:08.600 --> 19:11.520]  I want those of you that haven't experienced living defense to get it for
[19:11.520 --> 19:15.680]  yourself here just part of one testimonial I look in January 2016 I went
[19:15.680 --> 19:19.320]  in a hospital I went to VA hospital out here in Boyce and I was in there until
[19:19.320 --> 19:23.320]  June and one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to
[19:23.320 --> 19:27.720]  info wars three hours a day and I kept hearing Dr. Groob and all you guys
[19:27.720 --> 19:31.320]  talking about living defense let me tell you something man I had an internal
[19:31.320 --> 19:35.240]  digestive problem and something with it for about five or six years and the
[19:35.240 --> 19:38.640]  doctors they tried every time nobody could figure out what it is and then
[19:38.640 --> 19:42.000]  every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Groob and those commercials I said
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.760]  you know what I'm gonna get me some of that freaking living defense now I
[19:44.760 --> 19:47.360]  wasn't supposed to have any nutritional because they don't want you to have a
[19:47.360 --> 19:51.280]  stuff but I ordered it had it shipped to me I got it I hid it from the nurses I
[19:51.280 --> 19:56.200]  started taking it man that stuff changed my life it saved my life Alex Jones and
[19:56.200 --> 19:59.920]  info wars saved my life
[19:59.920 --> 20:27.480]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:27.480 --> 20:30.480]  much important information and some really informative guests coming up as
[20:30.480 --> 20:41.560]  well and I want to respond to the latest attacks of the press against info wars
[20:41.560 --> 20:46.680]  because they're attacks on all of us but I want to just go back to something
[20:46.680 --> 20:54.880]  yesterday that got me really physically angry and it was the stack of news that
[20:54.880 --> 20:58.960]  they just go to drudge the crew goes to bunch other sites just prints me
[20:58.960 --> 21:06.720]  everything I just go through it and without even trying to find articles
[21:06.720 --> 21:12.400]  about it it was AP Reuters you name it going yeah a billion extra people and
[21:12.400 --> 21:16.080]  into poverty they have to make two million will starve to death now who are
[21:16.080 --> 21:21.960]  at the subsistence level in the next year and they're just a little paragraph
[21:21.960 --> 21:26.920]  about two million they estimate will die there's not going to be fouchy up there
[21:26.920 --> 21:30.080]  saying we can't allow this to happen and there's not going to be anybody caring
[21:30.080 --> 21:35.800]  about people starving to death all over the world in Latin America Africa Asia
[21:37.720 --> 21:43.040]  horrible deaths dying from disease because you're debilitated because you're
[21:43.040 --> 21:46.120]  malnourished because you don't have the essential vitamins and minerals and trace
[21:46.120 --> 21:52.600]  elements and it's just like an afterthought it's funny everybody's
[21:52.600 --> 21:56.920]  wearing their masks everybody's getting into lining up and queuing and
[21:56.920 --> 22:08.280]  enforcing on each other for a hundred thousand dead globally when the flu kills
[22:08.280 --> 22:12.840]  millions every year the idea that oh when you get a cold now that's what the
[22:12.840 --> 22:17.200]  coronavirus is and it's definitely a souped-up cold that they've got a
[22:17.200 --> 22:21.240]  vaccine for you they're making you beg for it first though that when it shows
[22:21.240 --> 22:25.440]  up every year now we just are locked down and I told you months ago I said
[22:25.440 --> 22:30.560]  they're gonna announce that oh it's a year and a half oh now it's just gonna
[22:30.560 --> 22:37.040]  be forever this is the new normal no more public gatherings no more anything I
[22:37.040 --> 22:42.280]  mean this is martial law all the preparations and then with it is the
[22:42.280 --> 22:46.960]  medical tyranny global government's just the beginning once they have total
[22:46.960 --> 22:51.760]  tyranny they can force the inoculations the GMO the 5g on you and
[22:51.760 --> 23:00.040]  that's the plan and you can't go out and you can't fly on a plane you can't have
[23:00.040 --> 23:03.800]  a job you can't go to the grocery store because the corporations aren't gonna
[23:03.800 --> 23:08.360]  let you they showed you who has the power see libertarians pure libertarians
[23:08.360 --> 23:12.360]  like oh and the state will wither away like Mark said and you know the
[23:12.360 --> 23:16.760]  corporations and the people's will well then it'll be a total global democracy
[23:16.760 --> 23:22.760]  no it's the opposite you're a human resource that's seen as garbage to be
[23:22.760 --> 23:27.560]  thrown out negative value and they're building a system to phase you out but
[23:27.560 --> 23:33.200]  to make you more pliable they dumb you down they spiritually get you to sign
[23:33.200 --> 23:39.320]  on to being selfish and once you're selfish and don't care about other
[23:39.320 --> 23:42.560]  people your brain turns off and you don't care about yourself anymore and
[23:42.560 --> 23:49.200]  you become these dull things we see everywhere that the globalist hate and
[23:49.200 --> 23:54.680]  want to kill but they help put you into that state so that you don't even
[23:54.680 --> 24:02.120]  really have a soul anymore when they kill you it's a process again the spider
[24:02.120 --> 24:08.240]  first bites you and stuns you then ties you up and then slowly lets your juices
[24:08.240 --> 24:17.240]  dissolve puts its foot on you its leg little little hairy foot and when it
[24:17.240 --> 24:25.040]  hears the last beats in the heart right when the spirit leaves plunges the
[24:25.040 --> 24:31.520]  fangs in ritualistically it's so right the moment of death there's a eight-eyed
[24:31.520 --> 24:38.120]  spider sitting on top of you and that's what this is so right now it's walking
[24:38.120 --> 24:41.440]  up and it's got our feet kind of top we're kind of in the web like it's like
[24:41.440 --> 24:47.720]  oh lay there I am your medical doctor I'm Fauci oh let me just put this in you
[24:47.720 --> 24:50.960]  let me just slide these in and then you'll be safe you're like those look
[24:50.960 --> 24:54.600]  like fangs mark of the beast total control no don't listen to those that say
[24:54.600 --> 25:02.760]  that here liberal and it just slips them in and then pumps a little in and go see
[25:02.760 --> 25:08.880]  that feels better now go to sleep sweet and you oh I'll just do what they say I
[25:08.880 --> 25:12.960]  won't follow I'll go along with it and then you wake up and you're tied up and
[25:12.960 --> 25:18.680]  there's this burning feeling now and it comes over just my pretty now you're
[25:18.680 --> 25:24.480]  tied up I'm dissolving what you were I'm rendering you down to nothing and I'm
[25:24.480 --> 25:32.040]  gonna suck you dry forever and I'm gonna take you with me to hell you think death
[25:32.040 --> 25:40.760]  will free you no no you're gonna be inside of my guts forever and I will
[25:40.760 --> 25:45.440]  allow some of you to have children only so we can bring in new innocence and
[25:45.440 --> 25:50.960]  torture them remember they passed a law seven years ago in Washington state and
[25:50.960 --> 25:56.080]  in Oregon where they now are starting to drug babies in utero the psychiatrists
[25:56.080 --> 25:59.840]  are saying oh genetically we think you might be mentally ill that's eugenics
[25:59.840 --> 26:05.480]  we're sort of drugging babies in euro with prozac which causes total brain
[26:05.480 --> 26:10.160]  damage and everything else but see now the spiders want to get fangs in the
[26:10.160 --> 26:17.320]  womb through the placenta so the spider goes through your mouth into your
[26:17.320 --> 26:21.700]  stomach into your bloodstream and it's fangs lovingly get into your baby now
[26:21.700 --> 26:26.920]  see all of it is about your slow agonizing destruction and breaking
[26:26.920 --> 26:35.280]  your will and and making you beg and just no hope the spiders drink pure
[26:35.280 --> 26:41.240]  absolute abandonment and terror and no hope and and just children shivering in
[26:41.240 --> 26:45.520]  the cold waiting for the dungeon door to open for the spiders to come and
[26:45.520 --> 26:52.600]  torture them some more it's all about sucking the darkest most twisted energy
[26:52.600 --> 26:59.240]  off the planet and up there are the top generals the founties openly crazed
[26:59.240 --> 27:04.720]  openly psychotic openly evil involved in every evil you can imagine a ghoul-like
[27:04.720 --> 27:14.160]  creature and serving gates another little ghoul a little demon elf all
[27:14.160 --> 27:21.320]  scurrying around for their master tie them down lock them up stun them
[27:21.320 --> 27:27.720]  corrupt them poison them and prepare for the mass bloodletting more blood more
[27:27.720 --> 27:36.080]  death more evil and the ultimate crime is to go outside enjoy the sun and be
[27:36.080 --> 27:39.560]  with your children the ultimate crime is to be in the woods away from the
[27:39.560 --> 27:44.760]  electromagnetic poison the artificial the ultimate crime is to be healthy and
[27:44.760 --> 27:54.000]  strong and vibrant because they don't like that at all they want your essence
[27:54.000 --> 27:59.600]  and they want to drink it off because reveling in innocence and destroying
[27:59.600 --> 28:06.160]  innocence and torturing innocence is their God their spirit their soul their
[28:06.160 --> 28:10.400]  religion and while you're mesmerized watching your Netflix and your
[28:10.400 --> 28:14.400]  children are mesmerized watching their Netflix they are slowly being put into
[28:14.400 --> 28:20.560]  a trance so that as their very essence is torn out of them they are not even
[28:20.560 --> 28:27.520]  aware of whatever hit them while these demons of hell revel in your eternal
[28:27.520 --> 28:34.960]  annihilation pulling you directly down into a vortex of unknown agony for
[28:34.960 --> 28:45.840]  eternity but I say that they will be destroyed and that the spirit of Jesus
[28:45.840 --> 28:51.840]  Christ is now entering the planet at a level ever foreseen and our testing will
[28:51.840 --> 28:59.040]  be painful but soon we will leave you God forever we can all agree these are

[32:00.440 --> 32:04.640]  business it was basically empty and there were three motorcycle police in
[32:04.640 --> 32:09.800]  there and I said what do you think of this whole coronavirus thing they're
[32:09.800 --> 32:14.160]  like it looks like it's a hoax I said yeah you're absolutely right the way
[32:14.160 --> 32:19.640]  it's been handled is a hoax taking everybody that dies who happens to test
[32:19.640 --> 32:24.880]  positive even though they die of a heart attack or cancer or diabetes as dying
[32:24.880 --> 32:28.760]  from coronavirus is the big one and then of course they're also classifying
[32:28.760 --> 32:32.760]  everybody that test positive for coronavirus period not just covered 19
[32:32.760 --> 32:38.360]  as having it so they're they're upping a number of cases they're upping the
[32:38.360 --> 32:42.280]  number of deaths but still more people died this week and last week then died
[32:42.280 --> 32:46.520]  from the coronavirus from suicide so if anything it's causing divorces and
[32:46.520 --> 32:51.240]  suicide and stir craziness and basic insanity and a giant power grab with
[32:51.240 --> 32:55.000]  big pharma preparing a force inoculation which they even admit will not protect
[32:55.000 --> 32:59.160]  you from next year's mutation of the coronavirus
[32:59.160 --> 33:09.160]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:29.160 --> 33:56.880]  it is Friday April 10th the year is 2020
[33:56.880 --> 34:01.320]  we're 206 days down from this incredibly important election that they're now
[34:01.320 --> 34:06.640]  talking about canceling unless Trump lets people without any IDs mail in their
[34:06.640 --> 34:12.240]  ballots the Democrats will have months and months to fix the election just like
[34:12.240 --> 34:25.720]  they did in 2018 Wow the globalists are counter-striking right now but you see
[34:25.720 --> 34:31.280]  half the population submitting going along with all this roughly a lot of it
[34:31.280 --> 34:36.600]  through peer pressure they hate it as well but as they get good at all the new
[34:36.600 --> 34:40.680]  little rules that are given to us every week phased in and we were patted on the
[34:40.680 --> 34:47.040]  head and told we're heroes more and more people are seeing through it and there
[34:47.040 --> 34:53.840]  is a match awakening exploding right now especially when the mainstream media and
[34:53.840 --> 34:59.960]  federal regulators and others are out openly telling the president you don't
[34:59.960 --> 35:05.560]  have a medical degree you don't tell them hydroxychloroquine you don't tell
[35:05.560 --> 35:11.720]  them zinc protects the cells you know NIH website says it and the president
[35:11.720 --> 35:15.120]  even kind of get sheepish and says okay well we'll look at the study they come
[35:15.120 --> 35:17.480]  improving right of course they already had a bunch of studies they know
[35:17.480 --> 35:24.640]  hydroxychloroquine works great if you have saying and now all these medical
[35:24.640 --> 35:29.240]  doctors are treating thousands of patients in some cases of peace others
[35:29.240 --> 35:32.840]  hundreds they're on ABC news they're on CBS news but they're never on national
[35:32.840 --> 35:37.880]  news there's a human relationship you see the local news knows those doctors
[35:37.880 --> 35:41.960]  they have on all the time that their kids go to them they know they've got a
[35:41.960 --> 35:47.600]  lot of people they're treating they call them up come on doctor tells what's happening okay well
[35:47.600 --> 35:51.480]  hundred percent of people we give zinc with hydroxychloroquine get better you
[35:51.480 --> 35:54.680]  can get really sick if you take hydroxychloroquine by yourself because
[35:54.680 --> 35:57.840]  it can mess up things don't have zinc I don't need to be a medical doctor to know
[35:57.840 --> 36:04.240]  that but here's the thing Bill Gates doesn't even have a bachelor's degree I'm
[36:04.240 --> 36:07.280]  not one of these guys that you know worships education and all this stuff
[36:07.280 --> 36:10.320]  if you go you're already smart you learn some things from it you learn how the
[36:10.320 --> 36:14.560]  connections operate that's really what you're going to school for and then you
[36:14.560 --> 36:19.440]  can be successful but Gates didn't go to college because his mother was heading
[36:19.440 --> 36:25.400]  up IBM and they had a faster path for him but the point is they have Google
[36:25.400 --> 36:29.160]  banned me off the app last week saying I gave out false corona information and
[36:29.160 --> 36:33.360]  they link to a media matters video towards foreigners as the boss where I
[36:33.360 --> 36:37.000]  talked about hydroxychloroquine and zinc and how the president was right and I
[36:37.000 --> 36:45.680]  talked about quinine that now medical doctors are on TV saying absolutely is
[36:45.680 --> 36:49.400]  something that really boosts your immune system and blocks the virus doesn't
[36:49.400 --> 36:53.560]  mean it's a cure I'm not selling this medical doctors are saying and it's
[36:53.560 --> 37:02.760]  working so why on earth would they not want you to know that and what type of
[37:02.760 --> 37:08.640]  country are we that you're not even supposed to be able to talk about it
[37:08.640 --> 37:15.000]  now I've had Dr. Shiva audio rayon probably 30 40 times for the political
[37:15.000 --> 37:20.040]  stuff he's been involved in a lot of great work in Massachusetts but I got him
[37:20.040 --> 37:25.440]  on yesterday and I'm always happy about politics I was almost forgetting he's a
[37:25.440 --> 37:32.680]  PhD MIT runs a big complex as you can call it natural biotech company
[37:32.680 --> 37:36.440]  he's invented a lot of stuff I mean he's a prestigious guy himself but
[37:36.440 --> 37:39.560]  actually because he's was already doing what he was a teenager inventing the
[37:39.560 --> 37:45.480]  term email on record look it up psychopedia Britannica and so I'm gonna
[37:45.480 --> 37:52.960]  go over all the things he's done as a award-winning scientist and all the
[37:52.960 --> 37:58.720]  things he's invented in his big companies and his International Center of
[37:58.720 --> 38:06.240]  Integrative Systems located in Cambers Massachusetts I just wanted him to get
[38:06.240 --> 38:12.040]  on to lay out next segment we'll hold them a little bit over the next hour we
[38:12.040 --> 38:16.640]  can why they're trying to suppress people protecting themselves obviously
[38:16.640 --> 38:19.720]  they want to push the vaccine they want to hire death toll to create this phobia
[38:19.720 --> 38:25.600]  in the sphere but how we fight back against the system that the EU already
[38:25.600 --> 38:28.880]  put in place where they basically banned vitamins and minerals of any good
[38:28.880 --> 38:34.520]  dosage so we're gonna go to the yes right now Dr. Sheba but I want to ask you
[38:34.520 --> 38:39.560]  the time we have the five minutes left in this segment to give us a big 35,000
[38:39.560 --> 38:43.800]  foot overview on COVID-19 what's happened the National ID card they're
[38:43.800 --> 38:47.280]  announcing to be able to travel gates once the microchip people to understand
[38:47.280 --> 38:51.160]  he's literally involved in everything financing and controlling it and the
[38:51.160 --> 38:54.560]  group that's behind him about where you think this is going and how we can turn
[38:54.560 --> 38:57.800]  this around and how you think it's going for the globalist right now in this
[38:57.800 --> 39:03.320]  worldwide medical tyranny Alex what's happening is two phenomenon are
[39:03.320 --> 39:07.800]  occurring in parallel right the forces of evil and darkness and also the forces
[39:07.800 --> 39:12.200]  of light where people are getting educated but fundamentally this entire
[39:12.200 --> 39:17.480]  process was engineered by the front man you know they use a front man this guy
[39:17.480 --> 39:21.240]  Fauci but behind him is three major foundations the Gates Foundation the
[39:21.240 --> 39:25.040]  Chan Zuckerberg Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative all which are
[39:25.040 --> 39:30.360]  pro-vaccine and all support the sustainable development goals which paints
[39:30.360 --> 39:33.800]  a very utopian picture of where their future can go and you should go look at
[39:33.800 --> 39:39.760]  us calls SDG 3 but foundational to achieving SDG 3 in their view which is
[39:39.760 --> 39:44.240]  backed by the United Nations the WHO the CDC and by the way the Chinese
[39:44.240 --> 39:49.080]  Communist Party is that we must immunize everyone on the planet in fact the
[39:49.080 --> 39:54.320]  front page of it says no one left behind so that's like the big big goal here in
[39:54.320 --> 39:59.720]  order to execute on that goal you have to create massive amounts of fear you
[39:59.720 --> 40:03.760]  have to bring people into alignment and this thing that we're witnessing right
[40:03.760 --> 40:08.160]  here was was architected it was extremely well-planned and as what we're
[40:08.160 --> 40:12.160]  seeing right now is literally the country is split into two one group of
[40:12.160 --> 40:17.760]  people who are falling in line typically the educated elites and some of the
[40:17.760 --> 40:21.760]  people who are just bringing in on fear brought in on fear and then the other
[40:21.760 --> 40:25.400]  set of people are awakening to a lot of the videos that we've been putting up
[40:25.400 --> 40:29.320]  what you've been putting up and saying wait a minute you know the immune system
[40:29.320 --> 40:34.640]  is not some weakling we live in a you know a complete world of germs germs are
[40:34.640 --> 40:39.200]  not what kill us but it's a compromise immune system and getting that
[40:39.200 --> 40:43.720]  fundamental out there getting the fundamental true science not the fake
[40:43.720 --> 40:47.040]  science promoted by Bill Gates as you said this guy actually never really
[40:47.040 --> 40:50.480]  invented anything you know I actually created the first email system not just
[40:50.480 --> 40:55.520]  a term Bill Gates actually stole or bought DOS from someone else and this
[40:55.520 --> 41:00.400]  very nice family flipped it for him so as you said he has no education in the
[41:00.400 --> 41:05.920]  biological sciences yet because he's part of the global elite his entire goal
[41:05.920 --> 41:10.520]  is to create a factory of all of us we're all automatons serving this global
[41:10.520 --> 41:15.080]  elite and the model of using fear and fake science which is basically to say
[41:15.080 --> 41:19.640]  that the germs are what kill us which is absolutely not true we'd all be dead by
[41:19.640 --> 41:24.480]  now the reality is it's a weakened and dysfunctional immune system caused by
[41:24.480 --> 41:28.600]  dirty air dirty water dirty food maybe some genetics but pre-existing
[41:28.600 --> 41:32.200]  conditions where people's immune systems are compromised and instead of
[41:32.200 --> 41:35.720]  discussing immune health instead of talking about the things that we can
[41:35.720 --> 41:39.960]  use to boost immune health what they want to talk about is flattening the
[41:39.960 --> 41:44.560]  curb social distancing by the way I just gave a talk yesterday Alex social
[41:44.560 --> 41:49.480]  distancing as we know social isolation a wonderful paper came out talking about
[41:49.480 --> 41:54.320]  how when we isolate ourselves that we actually hurt our immune systems it's
[41:54.320 --> 41:58.400]  called loneliness as a molecule but fundamentally talking about that when
[41:58.400 --> 42:04.880]  we isolate people like we're doing that the doctors I mean my grandmother my
[42:04.880 --> 42:11.720]  dad's mom kept him so clean and and so absolutely not in the dirt that the
[42:11.720 --> 42:16.840]  nanny and the doctor said you've got to get him in the dirt he's not thriving
[42:16.840 --> 42:20.720]  and they didn't got him in the dirt and his black nanny gave him Hindu tea it
[42:20.720 --> 42:23.480]  was actually chicken crap you know when tea cooked up so he got really healthy
[42:23.480 --> 42:26.240]  because he didn't have immune system because it never been challenged they
[42:26.240 --> 42:29.360]  know all this and Gates wants to take over the whole human environment and
[42:29.360 --> 42:32.760]  make us these weaklings that have to live then with the drugs and things they
[42:32.760 --> 42:36.840]  give us and when in truth where this big colony organism that are exactly
[42:36.840 --> 42:41.120]  electrochemical soul sits in they've not proven it and we're this incredible
[42:41.120 --> 42:45.840]  badass fortress these little germs and things are piss hands compared to us if
[42:45.840 --> 42:49.960]  we have a good immune system one of my favorite things is swimming and swamps
[42:49.960 --> 42:53.160]  the studies show that just absolutely boost your immunity we'll be right back

[43:56.240 --> 44:00.640]  I don't need to remind you how four years ago I told you the polls against
[44:00.640 --> 44:05.320]  Trump were fake he was winning by a giant margin but election fraud almost
[44:05.320 --> 44:09.720]  stole the election from Trump and the American people well now they're pushing
[44:09.720 --> 44:15.320]  the idea that oh cancel the Republican-Democrat convention maybe cancel
[44:15.320 --> 44:20.280]  the election a year like the Olympics that's because they know Trump in every
[44:20.280 --> 44:26.400]  internal scientific poll is 20 points ahead of the brain damage by so they
[44:26.400 --> 44:31.000]  can say sir you look big like the Olympics go back off a year and then
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.880]  you'll still win in a year after you fix the crisis no they need more time to
[44:34.880 --> 44:38.360]  cook up an assassination an economic collapse a new virus
[44:38.360 --> 44:42.600]  Trump needs to say no in America we keep elections on time have the elections
[44:42.600 --> 44:47.720]  win by a landslide and not give the globalist what they want Hillary Biden
[44:47.720 --> 44:52.240]  they all want to suspend the election we shouldn't give them what they want we
[44:52.240 --> 44:58.680]  need to have a vote in America and reelect Trump 2020 you have to look
[44:58.680 --> 45:04.760]  really hard at mainstream television news and print media and mainstream
[45:04.760 --> 45:09.880]  establishment media news sites to find it I did extensive searches online with
[45:09.880 --> 45:14.320]  different search engines I I did a bunch of research looking at different TV
[45:14.320 --> 45:19.600]  archives and I couldn't find hardly anything except a couple local news
[45:19.600 --> 45:25.880]  stories with medical doctors on there talking about zinc zinc zinc the element
[45:25.880 --> 45:33.120]  on the periodic table that is essential to life and that is the most anti viral
[45:33.120 --> 45:38.080]  natural compound out there in thousands and thousands of studies by the most
[45:38.080 --> 45:45.000]  prestigious universities including big studies on the coronavirus family so do
[45:45.000 --> 45:52.640]  yourself a favor search engine zinc and antiviral three words zinc antiviral
[45:52.640 --> 45:58.720]  zinc antiviral do yourself a favor zinc antiviral since the invention and
[45:58.720 --> 46:03.280]  deployment of radar during World War two scientists have noted increased cancers
[46:03.280 --> 46:08.560]  and other health problems with those who were close to the devices that's where
[46:08.560 --> 46:12.880]  they're really high-powered if you're a quarter mile from a cell tower there's
[46:12.880 --> 46:16.400]  not any real high-powered radiation hitting you but if you're a couple
[46:16.400 --> 46:20.160]  hundred feet away they got fences around them with skull and crossbones on them
[46:20.160 --> 46:26.040]  for a reason it says it can hurt you so now with 5g that's even stronger these
[46:26.040 --> 46:31.400]  systems are literally above the streets just 20 or 30 feet from people's heads
[46:31.400 --> 46:35.640]  from their genitals from their bodies people are burning them down and
[46:35.640 --> 46:40.720]  attacking them all over the world now I'm saying don't do that use information
[46:40.720 --> 46:45.800]  warfare use the truth to expose it and sue local governments and others until
[46:45.800 --> 46:51.440]  they remove them that's the way to deal with this ladies and gentlemen take action
[46:51.440 --> 46:55.440]  in the information war but I got to tell you I can't blame the people that are
[46:55.440 --> 46:58.880]  doing it because they're under assault
[47:00.960 --> 47:06.440]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:18.560 --> 47:23.480]  I know why people tune into the broadcast over the years and think this
[47:23.480 --> 47:31.400]  guy's crazy and I remember we would go to Methodist churches Baptist churches
[47:31.400 --> 47:35.160]  but we would also go to evangelical churches because those evangelical
[47:35.160 --> 47:39.720]  preachers live in our neighborhood my parents were friends with and I remember
[47:39.720 --> 47:44.120]  they'd have visiting preachers come and so they ran the gamut some were con men
[47:44.120 --> 47:48.880]  some were really you know Holy Spirit five folks but I remember some of the
[47:48.880 --> 47:52.280]  old guys would come and they would lay out world government computers and
[47:52.280 --> 47:55.080]  microchips to track everything and they're gonna have a thing called the
[47:55.080 --> 47:59.200]  internet and it's these systems and they're gonna totally control everybody
[47:59.200 --> 48:02.440]  there's gonna be medical tyranny and there's gonna be a vaccine they inject
[48:02.440 --> 48:07.800]  into you and it's gonna have the proof that you've had all these other
[48:07.800 --> 48:10.400]  medicines and vaccines they're gonna make you take and it's gonna be a medical
[48:10.400 --> 48:14.120]  tyranny and I'm like eight years old hearing stuff like this and the beast
[48:14.120 --> 48:20.440]  computer in Brussels and then there was a thing called Texas best seminars we
[48:20.440 --> 48:23.680]  gonna find out the guy's name he was like a lay preacher we were at dinner one
[48:23.680 --> 48:27.760]  time so I wouldn't give speech there and he was like I'm like yeah I love a
[48:27.760 --> 48:32.280]  microchip track is an occasional society he goes no it'll be a digital
[48:32.280 --> 48:43.000]  vaccine that's nanotech I never heard that term even back then and it'll track
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.440]  you everywhere and if you haven't gone through all the medical tyranny they
[48:45.440 --> 48:50.880]  want you won't be able to buy or sell or leave your house and you know you're
[48:50.880 --> 48:54.040]  hearing these guys saying they're having visions about this and you're rolling
[48:54.040 --> 48:59.480]  your eyes I was too okay well no need to worry about visions anymore we're here
[48:59.480 --> 49:05.000]  and this is happening and just lay people are freaking out about what's
[49:05.000 --> 49:10.200]  going on and then they go research and they found about zinc and vitamin D and
[49:10.200 --> 49:15.440]  all this and the media is trying to block it how evil is that so this is
[49:15.440 --> 49:22.240]  science with dr. Shiva I do array with us from MIT runs a big company there's a
[49:22.240 --> 49:27.840]  lot of top medical research and he is a world-renowned systems scientist
[49:27.840 --> 49:32.680]  inventor and entrepreneur and again he did invent the email not just the term
[49:32.680 --> 49:36.160]  email so the time we have in like the next eight minutes or so I'm gonna try to
[49:36.160 --> 49:41.360]  shut up get into why you think they're blocking and we know why but I want your
[49:41.360 --> 49:46.160]  take and where you see all this going in this attempt to take vitamins and
[49:46.160 --> 49:49.440]  minerals away from people is I see it making everybody go crazy about
[49:49.440 --> 49:53.440]  vitamins and minerals that weren't before I mean I see this really backfiring
[49:53.440 --> 49:57.120]  but go through your view on that and then the actual stuff you covered
[49:57.120 --> 50:01.040]  yesterday about what is essential and how our bodies work and how people can
[50:01.040 --> 50:05.840]  protect themselves more so Alex you know what I want to cover very quickly is
[50:05.840 --> 50:11.200]  that as a system scientist you know I try to connect the dots right that's what
[50:11.200 --> 50:14.920]  system science is about it's about the ankle bones connected to the foot bone
[50:14.920 --> 50:17.960]  so you can use that principle to see that the immune system is a complex
[50:17.960 --> 50:22.880]  system but you can also use it just very briefly to understand the inner
[50:22.880 --> 50:26.840]  connection between freedom truth and health now I'm running for US Senate as
[50:26.840 --> 50:31.240]  I've talked about before Alex and the entire campaign for many years even
[50:31.240 --> 50:34.720]  before I got into politics was always about truth freedom and health and what
[50:34.720 --> 50:37.920]  do I mean by that what we're witnessing right now is that when you
[50:37.920 --> 50:43.200]  suppress freedom suppress freedom of speech you know promote censorship you
[50:43.200 --> 50:47.560]  never can practice a scientific method so all of science then is based on
[50:47.560 --> 50:51.760]  scientific consensus so what you get is fake science which means you diminish
[50:51.760 --> 50:57.040]  truth and from fake science they can create fake problems at Alex and fake
[50:57.040 --> 51:02.560]  solutions exactly dangerous is it to say that the president can't talk about
[51:02.560 --> 51:06.240]  zinc or hydroxychloroquine anybody can say whatever they want doesn't mean it's
[51:06.240 --> 51:10.640]  all right or true that's how we have and then in science it's always changing
[51:10.640 --> 51:13.240]  we're always learning more you're supposed to be able to challenge global
[51:13.240 --> 51:16.600]  warming being man-made you're supposed to challenge the vaccine but you're not
[51:16.600 --> 51:20.960]  supposed to it so the fundamental issue here is Alex they start with
[51:20.960 --> 51:24.800]  suppressing freedom so when you go to academia you know which I've been at
[51:24.800 --> 51:28.360]  in and out at four degrees at MIT my PhDs in biological engineering one of the
[51:28.360 --> 51:32.640]  futures is that what we have in academia now is your oldest profession these
[51:32.640 --> 51:37.200]  guys are paid a play and if you actually look at the biological sciences 50% of
[51:37.200 --> 51:41.720]  the funding that the NIH puts out is in biological sciences guess who guess who
[51:41.720 --> 51:45.440]  controls a lot of that people like Francis Collins at the NIH and people like
[51:45.440 --> 51:49.240]  Fauci they've been in there for four or five decades they're insiders so if
[51:49.240 --> 51:53.720]  you're a scientist at MIT Harvard today you know I happen to have been
[51:53.720 --> 51:57.360]  successful made money I have my own center so I don't owe anything to MIT but
[51:57.360 --> 52:01.800]  it's a mafia it's a cult and you've been inside it not part of it it's a complete
[52:01.800 --> 52:06.320]  cabal so you say anything against Fauci your university is not gonna receive
[52:06.320 --> 52:09.520]  found funding you're never gonna get tenure so we've created a bunch of
[52:09.520 --> 52:13.320]  lemmings in academia so anyone thinks that we should listen to them needs to
[52:13.320 --> 52:16.920]  take a step back and realize these guys are paid to play they're about scientific
[52:16.920 --> 52:20.680]  consensus they'll actually believe the Sun goes around the earth forget you know
[52:20.680 --> 52:25.440]  we know that story with Galileo but fundamentally these guys are creating
[52:25.440 --> 52:28.760]  fake science and by the way it is farewell address who did Eisenhower and
[52:28.760 --> 52:32.880]  61 want one of not the Russians he said we have a technological elite taking
[52:32.880 --> 52:37.400]  control of academia and sciences and they are the main threat exactly so the
[52:37.400 --> 52:41.280]  scientific establishment really it was evolving at that time it was the
[52:41.280 --> 52:46.240]  consolidation of power basically the consolidation of quote-unquote who
[52:46.240 --> 52:50.200]  determines what truth is who determines what innovation is so those group
[52:50.200 --> 52:54.840]  control can create fake problems and fake solutions you know in infectious
[52:54.840 --> 52:58.640]  diseases viruses are gonna kill all of us based on that you need vaccines and
[52:58.640 --> 53:02.920]  therefore the goals to control our health fake problems fake solutions you
[53:02.920 --> 53:06.760]  control our health now you create weak human beings who can't fight for freedom
[53:06.760 --> 53:10.320]  so that's sort of the system of truth freedom and health so when we're running
[53:10.320 --> 53:15.400]  in Massachusetts Alex we have a huge groundswell of amazing volunteers who
[53:15.400 --> 53:18.920]  come out we're close to collecting all of our signatures they've stopped us as
[53:18.920 --> 53:22.520]  you talk about the electioneering control they've stopped us from collecting
[53:22.520 --> 53:26.760]  signatures that's why the page that you showed up everyone listening Alex
[53:26.760 --> 53:31.080]  everyone we must win in Massachusetts because Massachusetts is the epicenter
[53:31.080 --> 53:34.440]  of the deep state and what I'm talking about here is here's a mecca of medicine
[53:34.440 --> 53:38.040]  Harvard Medical School the mecca of technology so by winning here it's
[53:38.040 --> 53:41.600]  gonna be like taking a stake in stabbing it right in the deep state so what we
[53:41.600 --> 53:44.600]  need Alex is what your audience needs to understand is everyone should go to
[53:44.600 --> 53:49.400]  Shiva for Senate scroll down and if they're in mass people think Rand Paul is
[53:49.400 --> 53:53.520]  amazing you would just be like a hydrogen bomb in the deep state that's
[53:53.520 --> 53:57.280]  what we need we need a hydrogen bomb because a guy like me is is like
[53:57.280 --> 54:00.320]  everyone else a working-class guy who earned his way and so if you scroll down
[54:00.320 --> 54:04.560]  there you'll see that people should go in there and fill out a form and we will
[54:04.560 --> 54:08.520]  mail you the nomination paper so you can sign and send in the Democratic
[54:08.520 --> 54:12.240]  establishment and the GOP establishment three lawyers are running against me
[54:12.240 --> 54:15.960]  Alex all total scumbags that's what we got to win but getting back to the
[54:15.960 --> 54:21.080]  immune system this establishment of suppressing sent a suppressing freedom
[54:21.080 --> 54:25.960]  has created this notion that the immune system is some weakling that the virus
[54:25.960 --> 54:30.560]  is some animal that comes and eats your tissues in fact most MDs unfortunately
[54:30.560 --> 54:34.080]  because of the big pharma medical education they don't know jack about
[54:34.080 --> 54:37.840]  the immune system I'm sorry they just don't it's oh they admit that they don't
[54:37.840 --> 54:40.920]  even spend a week on the immune system or even a half a day or vaccines but
[54:40.920 --> 54:44.400]  let's just pull back for a moment just like they teach us we're all racist and
[54:44.400 --> 54:48.000]  we're all victims the government's got to divide us to keep us safe from each
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.680]  other it's the same thing we're telling us we're all victims and we're all
[54:51.680 --> 54:55.600]  weak we're all gonna die unless we have big pharma they're literally teaching us
[54:55.600 --> 55:00.240]  how to be victims and how it's heroic to be a jellyfish exactly so that's a
[55:00.240 --> 55:05.440]  bottom line we are we we are weak people when the reality is that they weaken us
[55:05.440 --> 55:08.880]  through their big Ag Monsanto through their genetic engineering foods they
[55:08.880 --> 55:12.920]  weaken us so dirtier dirtier dirty water dirty food doctor as you know I keep
[55:12.920 --> 55:15.960]  it running something you're saying so true if you just type in flu vaccine
[55:15.960 --> 55:19.840]  lowers immunity next year and there's all these articles admitting that they
[55:19.840 --> 55:23.960]  never guessed the right mutation and it lowers your immunity to the flu the next
[55:23.960 --> 55:27.920]  year so what you just said it's totally true yeah and the other thing that's true
[55:27.920 --> 55:31.360]  Alex is look at their solution this idiot Fauci okay who's basically the
[55:31.360 --> 55:35.800]  front man for pharma isolate yourself quarantine yourself don't get any sun
[55:35.800 --> 55:40.240]  let's look at that there are infinite number of papers landmark studies which
[55:40.240 --> 55:44.680]  show when you isolate people isolate people you create a detrimental
[55:44.680 --> 55:49.960]  situation that's worse in obesity worse in heart disease worse in smoking you
[55:49.960 --> 55:55.400]  basically down regulate genes which create antiviral activity and you up
[55:55.400 --> 55:59.040]  regulate genes we create inflammatory response so think about that you're
[55:59.040 --> 56:02.760]  basically destroying the immune system by social isolation then you tell people
[56:02.760 --> 56:07.320]  don't get out in the sun UVB radiation vitamin D as we know vitamin D is an
[56:07.320 --> 56:11.160]  antimicrobial and then people can't go out they're creating five people stay
[56:11.160 --> 56:13.360]  there and I've been interrupting a lot because you're just making such great
[56:13.360 --> 56:16.720]  points for the next three segments if you can stay and we'll talk about the
[56:16.720 --> 56:19.880]  Senate thing that's exciting too but you as a medical guy and the doctor that's
[56:19.880 --> 56:22.920]  the guy that's amazing I politics is a great way to get you in the Senate but
[56:22.920 --> 56:26.720]  when you get into this it's so dead on and folks you know this is not just our
[56:26.720 --> 56:30.480]  opinion this is established known fact these people know what they're doing
[56:30.480 --> 56:34.680]  there is no vaccine for the common cold that is what COVID-19 is souped up will
[56:34.680 --> 56:37.600]  be right back but let me just put this out or we won't be here you should
[56:37.600 --> 56:41.560]  there's either trying to shut us down what I do for myself personally every
[56:41.560 --> 56:45.240]  day and this is for adults children you name it look into this DNA Force Plus
[56:45.240 --> 56:50.440]  with PQQ and CoQ 10 now obviously big brother doesn't want folks promoting
[56:50.440 --> 56:53.800]  things like this to tell you what they do do your own research into PQQ and CoQ
[56:53.800 --> 56:56.960]  10 and other things that are in this go do your own research what it does in the
[56:56.960 --> 57:00.600]  cells the mitochondria all of it and then ask yourself why aren't you getting
[57:00.600 --> 57:04.480]  a bottle DNA Force Plus it's 50% off it's our most expensive product because
[57:04.480 --> 57:08.600]  it's not synthetic PQQ or CoQ 10 even the synthetics expensive this is the
[57:08.600 --> 57:12.240]  most expensive product for us to produce and we usually would even order a lot
[57:12.240 --> 57:17.960]  of it's so much for us to get it but I have doubled the orders last year and so
[57:17.960 --> 57:21.560]  we could get even more of it and get the price down so get your DNA Force Plus
[57:21.560 --> 57:26.560]  today this is the hydrogen bomb of boosting your defenses and we have X
[57:26.560 --> 57:30.840]  3 very close to selling out in the two ounce bottles that is 60% I'll be
[57:30.840 --> 57:34.760]  selling out I want you to get high quality iodine the tri iodine is a
[57:34.760 --> 57:39.880]  major breakthrough you heard that this very doctor yesterday Chiba talk about
[57:39.880 --> 57:43.160]  important the tri iodine inch that's what another doctor told us what we came
[57:43.160 --> 57:46.560]  out with it well they're right back stay with us
[57:47.000 --> 57:53.600]  Bio PQQ research that look into it for yourself big brother and the globalist
[57:53.600 --> 57:57.600]  don't want you to CoQ 10 oh you probably want to spend some time researching
[57:57.600 --> 58:04.800]  CoQ 10 and then research DNA Force Plus and the types that we have in here the
[58:04.800 --> 58:11.320]  very best forms the PQQ and CoQ 10 and then a whole bunch of other natural
[58:11.320 --> 58:17.400]  ingredients for mother nature that are known to supercharge it all this is our
[58:17.400 --> 58:22.720]  best-selling overall formula and I've told listeners the end of last year that
[58:22.720 --> 58:27.920]  we can't sell products at 50% off anymore because there's not enough markup in
[58:27.920 --> 58:31.960]  them to find our operations but because of what's happening and going on in the
[58:31.960 --> 58:38.280]  world right now I really want everybody who hasn't used or tried or enjoyed the
[58:38.280 --> 58:43.720]  benefits of DNA Force Plus to have DNA Force Plus yourself and your family DNA
[58:43.720 --> 58:47.920]  Force Plus now 50% off
[58:47.920 --> 58:53.280]  what's amazing about the US Constitution Bill of Rights is that even though
[58:53.280 --> 58:59.200]  it's 240 years old it's more pertinent and more powerful today than it's ever
[58:59.200 --> 59:05.680]  been we look at the huge AI takeover and total surveillance of our lives and the
[59:05.680 --> 59:11.000]  theory that comes with it the oppression and it's all linked to not having due
[59:11.000 --> 59:14.920]  process and not having a Fourth Amendment against being illegally
[59:14.920 --> 59:22.960]  surveilled it's all predicated on having no privacy if we simply embrace the
[59:22.960 --> 59:26.880]  Bill of Rights a Constitution and force that against Big Tech they would never
[59:26.880 --> 59:30.640]  get away with this but because we're not enforcing our Bill of Rights a
[59:30.640 --> 59:36.280]  Constitution based in common sense the bottom is falling out and the sky is
[59:36.280 --> 59:41.120]  just the beginning it's certainly not the limit that's why we're rediscovering
[59:41.120 --> 59:44.520]  what made America great and what the Renaissance is all about true human
[59:44.520 --> 59:49.080]  empowerment it begins at M4s.com
[59:50.520 --> 59:55.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:55.840 --> 1:00:15.520]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones this is a
[1:00:15.520 --> 1:00:20.640]  short segment long segments coming up and I want doctor this joining us right
[1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:26.840]  now Shiva out of your way running for Senate Massachusetts to get into the
[1:00:26.840 --> 1:00:30.200]  body get into the mechanisms get into the studies get into the facts this is
[1:00:30.200 --> 1:00:34.520]  known okay it's like saying you need oxygen to live it's known you need food
[1:00:34.520 --> 1:00:38.400]  to live why it has nutrients if you don't get the nutrients if all you got
[1:00:38.400 --> 1:00:42.240]  was white bread and water you'd you'd you'd dive the cold or fluid six months
[1:00:42.240 --> 1:00:46.680]  I mean something that came by you wouldn't even feel your dad that's why one
[1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:49.120]  way the British used to kill people in concentration camps they actually
[1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:53.560]  invented them and used them against the Irish used them against the Scots 400
[1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:57.240]  years ago first since the Scots then they called them concentration camps by
[1:00:57.240 --> 1:01:03.160]  the middle of the 18th century the US Army adopted that with Native Americans
[1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:07.040]  and I'm not batching the British I mean I'm I had a Welsh name but what I'm
[1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:10.920]  getting there is they wouldn't kill you they just put you out there and feed
[1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:16.040]  you bread and water and Andrew Jackson's mother and brother died in a British
[1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:20.680]  concentration camp was it South Carolina when he was 12 that's why I
[1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:24.440]  didn't like the British too much point is that's how you kill somebody is you
[1:01:24.440 --> 1:01:28.640]  just don't give them nutrients and they just die doc get into your campaign oh
[1:01:28.640 --> 1:01:35.560]  that that is important tell us about that spend a few minutes on that we lost
[1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:44.560]  his audio we turn it on for him I can't tell what you said Mike we're gonna have
[1:01:44.560 --> 1:01:47.960]  to troubleshoot it doc we got a technical problem this happens more and more
[1:01:47.960 --> 1:01:54.000]  gremlins have attacked the equipment and well maybe maybe he turned his mic
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:00.400]  off oh fantastic hey doc so what's about your Senate campaign yeah so one of the
[1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:03.960]  things I wanted to say was you know I grew up as an untouchable in India I
[1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:08.880]  don't know if you know India's a caste system in the 1960s one of the political
[1:02:08.880 --> 1:02:12.200]  leaders in India realized that the so-called people the elites said
[1:02:12.200 --> 1:02:16.480]  were dumb to keep them down was because they were just dumb he figured out that
[1:02:16.480 --> 1:02:20.320]  they weren't getting enough protein Alex so he created a program where people
[1:02:20.320 --> 1:02:23.360]  could get protein and you suddenly saw these so-called dumb people immediately
[1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:28.440]  get very very neutrified and you know start excelling so nutrition and
[1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:32.920]  intelligence nutrition and your future is closely linked so you know when I'm
[1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:36.920]  running for Senate here one of the core things that's bringing out so many people
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:41.440]  from the grassroots is that we're leading with health Alex and and that is
[1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:44.320]  blowing away the establishment here because they don't want to talk about
[1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:49.200]  health they actually want to keep people weak so we have this huge growth of
[1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:53.000]  people grassroots lots of women lots of mothers who don't want their kids to be
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:56.680]  you know forced vaccinated or coming to our movement very different than the
[1:02:56.680 --> 1:03:00.280]  last campaign we ran against Elizabeth Warren but one of the key things we need
[1:03:00.280 --> 1:03:04.440]  to get on the ballot Alex and we've been getting signatures the other guys don't
[1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:07.440]  have a grassroots movement so they're trying to shut us down from collecting
[1:03:07.440 --> 1:03:12.080]  signatures so we're going online Alex so anyone from Massachusetts anyone
[1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:16.240]  listening to your show right now Alex who knows people in Massachusetts tell
[1:03:16.240 --> 1:03:19.560]  them to go to Shiva for Senate and we've created it we've used you know
[1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:23.520]  technology that I've created they just click a button as they go into if you
[1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:27.880]  can show on the screen you know get get a signature nomination form sent to you
[1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:32.200]  and we will mail them the nomination form they sign it with a self-addressed
[1:03:32.200 --> 1:03:36.160]  envelope if you click right there and then they can send it to us and then we
[1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:40.000]  get a certified signature we made it really really easy Alex that's Shiva
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:46.480]  or the number for Senate calm number for Senate calm and they literally go and
[1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:49.800]  it's for Massachusetts residents or anyone listening if you know your
[1:03:49.800 --> 1:03:53.560]  friends or family Massachusetts tell them to go there fill it out we'll mail that
[1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:57.600]  to me it's quite expensive first to get it out but we make it easy with all the
[1:03:57.600 --> 1:04:02.120]  nonsense the fascist state of Massachusetts is doing to stop guys like
[1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:05.320]  me from getting on the ballot meanwhile they're making sure the Joe
[1:04:05.320 --> 1:04:08.880]  Kennedys and the other guys because they're paying for their nomination
[1:04:08.880 --> 1:04:13.400]  signatures but bottom line bottom line Alex the opportunity to Massachusetts is
[1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:17.800]  to be the tip of the spear to bottom line even if you don't win most people
[1:04:17.800 --> 1:04:20.880]  that come from the grass to run through four times before they win you're all
[1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:24.280]  over TV you're all of everywhere bombing them with this information and these
[1:04:24.280 --> 1:04:27.440]  stations TV stations are things if they have the other candidates on have to have
[1:04:27.440 --> 1:04:31.400]  you on you're a great guest and you're kicking ass and so keeping you in the
[1:04:31.400 --> 1:04:34.960]  field is another critical part of the resistance but I want you to go back to
[1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:37.800]  what we were talking about when we come back we'll do two more segments on
[1:04:37.800 --> 1:04:42.000]  nutrition now they're using this as the total control arm of the globalist and
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:48.240]  again how elites throughout history actually called these slaves the little
[1:04:48.240 --> 1:04:52.000]  people because generationally they starve them that wasn't just in India folks
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:57.800]  every country every nation had the untouchables it's been sold out for more
[1:04:57.800 --> 1:05:03.120]  than four months but our best-selling vitamin D3 and vitamin K formula is back
[1:05:03.120 --> 1:05:08.840]  in stock winner son in the fall in the winter as you know your body when
[1:05:08.840 --> 1:05:13.480]  you're not getting sunlight on the skin does not produce vitamin D3 so it's
[1:05:13.480 --> 1:05:17.960]  important to ingest it but a lot of people do not absorb it well in the gut
[1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:23.200]  so you take this formula under the tongue it tastes sweet naturally let it
[1:05:23.200 --> 1:05:28.280]  sit there about 30 seconds to a minute and then you swallow the rest and it's
[1:05:28.280 --> 1:05:33.800]  just amazing it's back in stock and yes we're gonna offer to 50% off because
[1:05:33.800 --> 1:05:38.200]  that's the right thing to do during this crisis so when her son 50% off we
[1:05:38.200 --> 1:05:43.600]  also have ultra 12 highest quality B12 it is also available take it out of the
[1:05:43.600 --> 1:05:48.520]  tongue 50% off info or store.com and we have X3 even though it's gonna sell out
[1:05:48.520 --> 1:05:53.120]  super high quality for a vitamin it is 60% off because I want you to have it
[1:05:53.120 --> 1:06:18.920]  right now info or store.com
[1:06:18.920 --> 1:06:24.560]  Dr. Shiva Aidure is our guest he's an amazing MIT trained scientist
[1:06:24.560 --> 1:06:30.120]  does amazing research has a lot of big successful companies I'm not gonna go
[1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:35.480]  over it all of his bio or industry awards and the commercial products that
[1:06:35.480 --> 1:06:40.600]  he's developed he's running for Senate in Massachusetts really the heart of the
[1:06:40.600 --> 1:06:46.720]  Harvard Globalist Mafia but we just joined this he briefly got into India
[1:06:46.720 --> 1:06:52.120]  and the caste system and if you look at that you've got this lower caste that
[1:06:52.120 --> 1:06:57.000]  you know handles you know things that are seem as unclean or whatever and that
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:01.520]  was how the establishment basically divided and conquered civilizations when
[1:07:01.520 --> 1:07:04.640]  the British showed up it was very easy for them to take control because they
[1:07:04.640 --> 1:07:10.120]  also had their caste system and if you go back to ancient England or place like
[1:07:10.120 --> 1:07:14.000]  France they actually the nobles would call the little villagers the little
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:17.800]  people that's because they were always kept on very small pieces of property
[1:07:17.800 --> 1:07:23.600]  in the more oppressive feudal systems and if you've got a dog for say hurting
[1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:28.240]  the noble sheep part of its paw would be cut off so he couldn't chase the
[1:07:28.240 --> 1:07:32.280]  king's deer weren't even allowed to have a dog that could hunt and you weren't
[1:07:32.280 --> 1:07:35.440]  allowed to have a knife that had a point on it you would get a square you know a
[1:07:35.440 --> 1:07:40.640]  square knife and so they would keep it with starvation level you'd be
[1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:44.480]  executed in ancient England you know under the Norman if you got caught with
[1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:49.120]  a rabbit you'd kill because that's the king's land and so you're kept looking
[1:07:49.120 --> 1:07:53.200]  at all this game and all this food and you're killed if you're caught eating it
[1:07:53.200 --> 1:07:56.360]  and and you could read manuscripts or something more corrupt no one's saying
[1:07:56.360 --> 1:07:59.560]  you know we don't want to feed him too much we don't want to get up and he
[1:07:59.560 --> 1:08:04.480]  you want to control them well in India that was a codified system and he was
[1:08:04.480 --> 1:08:11.080]  bringing up and he repeated Dr. Sheba here getting into this how in India they
[1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:14.200]  were calling the untouchables you know idiots because they were just wandering
[1:08:14.200 --> 1:08:18.120]  around like zombies because why did the environmentalists not want us to have
[1:08:18.120 --> 1:08:21.280]  protein and want us to have meat and the rest of it because it's known that when
[1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:24.320]  humans started eating that our heads got bigger we got smarter we got stronger
[1:08:24.320 --> 1:08:27.880]  when we became more like predators instead of prey and so somebody that's not
[1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:32.640]  getting protein acts like a dumb bunny rabbit instead of a tiger and I'm not
[1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:35.280]  knocking folks are vegetarian you just gotta eat a lot of beans and rice to get
[1:08:35.280 --> 1:08:38.960]  that but people that eat meat it's a it's a weapon system it's got hormones
[1:08:38.960 --> 1:08:43.080]  in it's got everything in it and it's how they control the untouchables was
[1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:47.880]  keeping them at zombie level well if you look at McDonald's at Bill Gates owns
[1:08:47.880 --> 1:08:51.960]  part of in Monsanto they admit diet injections and junctions as Bertrand
[1:08:51.960 --> 1:08:55.720]  Russell said one of the top liberals you know philosophers that they would they
[1:08:55.720 --> 1:09:00.200]  would dumb down our diet and take away high protein because it's known you
[1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:04.720]  start that there's manuscripts in and the Romans would say you feed slaves red
[1:09:04.720 --> 1:09:09.160]  meat you're gonna get an uprising so they fed them like oatmeal okay and and
[1:09:09.160 --> 1:09:14.680]  that's so they know how to manage people tigers eat meat bunny rabbit see
[1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:18.560]  grass and and so you look at India oh you know don't eat your meat okay whatever
[1:09:18.560 --> 1:09:24.720]  you get a wasn't high IQ it's that mothers that breastfeed 20 30 points
[1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:27.520]  higher in their children because that's what your mother made that's the fat
[1:09:27.520 --> 1:09:30.600]  your brain grows on well look at the formulas they've had caught the U.M. with
[1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:33.520]  these approved formula programs with all these millions of kids die driving
[1:09:33.520 --> 1:09:38.480]  enough protein for them they die so that is a system of untouchables so well
[1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:41.120]  there's many cycles we need to her doc you've got me really going here today and
[1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:44.320]  I want to get it out people can defend their immune system and boost it you
[1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:48.360]  know with your whole MIT background doctorate on that and your major companies
[1:09:48.360 --> 1:09:54.280]  that study that but get into your own Indian American experience of that yeah
[1:09:54.280 --> 1:10:01.520]  so look Alex a bottom line is the use of food or the lack of giving food to
[1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:05.480]  people and the nutrient density that you gave was always was a methodology of
[1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:09.000]  control and people have always had to fight for health and it's not some
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:12.240]  stations didn't carry that segment so explain the caste system that's
[1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:17.400]  fascinating well and we have a caste system here but the caste system in
[1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:20.840]  India was on the top of it where the priesthood you know what you would call
[1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:24.840]  the academics of today right the Fauci's and the people who are always there
[1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:29.360]  regardless of presidents come and going the next level was the Kings right
[1:10:29.360 --> 1:10:32.600]  today we called them politicians president so you notice Fauci's always
[1:10:32.600 --> 1:10:36.480]  there presidents come and go and now he's advising Trump before he was
[1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:40.880]  advising Reagan the next level below that was the Warriors right because the
[1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:44.600]  Kings unleashed the Warriors to go fight and today we have the military and
[1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:48.320]  below that were the business folks and below that were the Shudras the
[1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:53.600]  untouchables who basically did all the all the you know low-level work so those
[1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:58.440]  people as we just shared were kept in very very moderate conditions very low
[1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:02.920]  conditions so they would not rise up and what we have today is the same model
[1:11:02.920 --> 1:11:07.600]  here we want to diminish people's health so we don't rise up and fight for our
[1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:11.360]  freedom so we don't get the truth we deserve and from truth we get freedom so
[1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:16.360]  they create this very horrible feedback process that we actively keep people
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:20.040]  suppressed with bad food so if you look at the United States 54 percent of
[1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:24.200]  people today kids have autoimmune disorders one out of five kids have a
[1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:28.720]  mental issue right some mental issue going on and the reality is when you
[1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:32.080]  look at the immune system that we're talking about right now we actively
[1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:36.200]  suppress people's immune systems and instead of addressing boosting them which
[1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:40.200]  frankly they don't want to do the goal is to use the people who have suppressed
[1:11:40.200 --> 1:11:44.640]  immune systems to drive them to more vaccines more vaccines more pharma
[1:11:44.640 --> 1:11:48.640]  drugs and the goals to take most of humanity and take them to that process
[1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:53.360]  so from a scientific standpoint Alex my entire life you know the company I run
[1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:57.440]  called cytosol that came out of my research at MIT we're actually able to
[1:11:57.440 --> 1:12:02.240]  model at the molecular level the mechanisms and actually prove why
[1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:05.440]  certain things work irrespective of their fake science or them trying to
[1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:09.080]  discount it and that's what I do we're actually helping people understand at
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:13.320]  the molecular level to put down these fake scientists so for example we talked
[1:12:13.320 --> 1:12:18.080]  about the power of vitamin D why is vitamin D powerful in this case vitamin D
[1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:23.280]  really empowers us to enable the creation of catholosidens
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:29.400]  catholosidens are something that empower the body to go and knock out the
[1:12:29.400 --> 1:12:35.960]  surface membrane of viruses and bacteria etc most doctors don't even know
[1:12:35.960 --> 1:12:40.200]  about this Alex ask him what is a catholosidens they won't know it vitamin
[1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:45.640]  D creates these catholosidens it's a fuel so you undernourish the body with
[1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:49.800]  vitamin D you make the body more prone to viruses period so in the letter I
[1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:54.000]  wrote to Trump I said look take all those people have COVID-19 take those
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  people are immunocompromised give them high dosage vitamin D in one shot 50,000
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:04.200]  I use for two days and give them 400,000 I use of vitamin A for two days why
[1:13:04.200 --> 1:13:09.000]  vitamin A well vitamin A as you look at the molecular pathways vitamin A gets
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:12.920]  created from your thyroid when you get all the great carotenoid foods a rich
[1:13:12.920 --> 1:13:18.400]  greens a dark green green and purple foods and your body makes vitamin A and
[1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:22.640]  you know what that vitamin A does Alex it creates beautiful scaffolds beautiful
[1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:27.440]  cytokarotens so the viruses can't even protect can come in that's number one
[1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:31.960]  iodine you've talked about it iodide you need both that's what supports the
[1:13:31.960 --> 1:13:37.200]  thyroid to make vitamin A now all of this that we're saying is not some BS and
[1:13:37.200 --> 1:13:42.720]  what's unfortunate what the real BS is bullshitting people that that the immune
[1:13:42.720 --> 1:13:47.080]  system is weak that the only way out of it is vaccines vaccines vaccines and
[1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:51.200]  chemicals chemicals chemicals so that's why they have a problem right now Alex
[1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:54.840]  because you're looking at a guy who's got four degrees from MIT's PhD in
[1:13:54.840 --> 1:13:58.760]  biological engineering is a Fulbright scholar and I'm the guy who was invited
[1:13:58.760 --> 1:14:02.480]  by the National Science Foundation just four months ago to give the lecture on
[1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:07.840]  the modern immune system so this is why we need to go boldly and expose Fauci
[1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:12.280]  Gates Zuckerberg the Clintons because what we're witnessing right here is a
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:15.560]  destruction of science and doctor you're on fire let me stop you in the next
[1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:19.520]  segment I want to get into this you said this yesterday that's why I wanted you
[1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:23.880]  back on and I hope you'll come on pretty much every day with the Owen ever
[1:14:23.880 --> 1:14:27.880]  shows I know you've been coming a lot and laying this out for people because you
[1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:32.560]  said they're losing big pharma every statistic shows is not trusted they're
[1:14:32.560 --> 1:14:37.040]  losing the doctors as you said in even the UN zone videos they say doctors
[1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:40.520]  returning against us in the vaccines they they see what it's doing the head
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:44.080]  vaccine a doctor at the World Health Organization we already played that clip so
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:46.360]  so when we come back we'll get into all this with you but I want people to
[1:14:46.360 --> 1:14:51.960]  understand something that this is real and so here he is giving these lectures
[1:14:51.960 --> 1:14:55.480]  and he's respected at MIT I mean I don't just have guests on I looked into
[1:14:55.480 --> 1:14:59.680]  everything he's saying is true this guy has been an email folks but there's a lot
[1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:03.960]  of people like him too and they're pissed and they know that if they speak up
[1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:08.000]  they'll be shut down this guy has his own company this guy's wealthy he is
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:12.040]  doing it because he understands that we're all gonna be turned into this
[1:15:12.040 --> 1:15:15.400]  slave class and he's already broken out of that he wants us all to break out
[1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:18.320]  with him and that's this is about realizing they're trying to make us all
[1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:21.560]  slaves trying to turn us all against each other trying to make us all fight
[1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:25.920]  over what color we are while they are poisoning every damn one of us and don't
[1:15:25.920 --> 1:15:29.600]  want us to perform or be successful because Bill Gates is a coward and a
[1:15:29.600 --> 1:15:34.160]  little chicken-neck nobody he can't compete with hundreds of millions of
[1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:38.240]  people like Dr. Shiva out of your ray or Alex Jones are you they thought those
[1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:41.880]  guys can't deal with us they know that they're suppressing everyone because
[1:15:41.880 --> 1:15:45.240]  every time they don't they don't get to run the system the way they want to
[1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:53.720]  well guess what jerks you're not running thing anymore the people are the revolution is now
[1:15:54.120 --> 1:15:59.720]  if you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs listen to me you
[1:15:59.720 --> 1:16:04.120]  don't know me and we'll never meet I had a problem like you once I drank and
[1:16:04.120 --> 1:16:09.000]  used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:14.760]  life I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me
[1:16:14.760 --> 1:16:19.280]  if you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do
[1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:24.320]  it alone you need to call the national treatment advisors they'll immerse you

[1:18:03.560 --> 1:18:08.280]  Times the Washington Post wired magazine all reported years ago the major
[1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:15.240]  studies show 5g cause increased cancer in rats it's a fact 5g is just a later
[1:18:15.240 --> 1:18:19.720]  generation of systems that are on record for more than 70 years to cause
[1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:27.160]  cancer they rub the DNA molecules together they are microwaves well now
[1:18:27.160 --> 1:18:31.240]  YouTube has admitted to the BBC and others that they're banning anyone
[1:18:31.240 --> 1:18:36.440]  criticizing 5g even if you don't connect to coronavirus they're banning it but
[1:18:36.440 --> 1:18:41.640]  the studies do show that 5g lowers your immunity to viruses period their peer
[1:18:41.640 --> 1:18:46.080]  reviewed journals we're showing these documents on air and the globalist can
[1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:50.600]  go to hell the human rebellion against globalist machines has begun we're not
[1:18:50.600 --> 1:18:54.320]  troglodytes afraid of technology we don't like technology with Trojan
[1:18:54.320 --> 1:18:59.880]  Wars anti-human crap in it listen to me very carefully we have confirmed that
[1:18:59.880 --> 1:19:05.560]  California is set within days or weeks to announce a total stay at home order
[1:19:05.560 --> 1:19:11.360]  and we'll shut down grocery stores and yes even pharmacies ladies and gentlemen
[1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:15.640]  this is what they're announcing to create total panic to try to trigger a
[1:19:15.640 --> 1:19:19.560]  depression to blame on Trump then when Trump doesn't fall astute they will
[1:19:19.560 --> 1:19:26.280]  blame every single death on President Trump this is a psyop using a real
[1:19:26.280 --> 1:19:31.280]  deadly virus this is super dangerous and everyone needs to get supplies in
[1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:37.400]  now the food chain is getting low as well and you need to get the supplements
[1:19:37.400 --> 1:19:42.560]  just to be safe at infowarstore.com and stock up because who knows the future

[1:19:52.880 --> 1:19:57.680]  but take action now at infowarstore.com
[1:19:57.680 --> 1:20:17.680]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:20:17.680 --> 1:20:25.680]  America and the world is in the middle of a globalist authoritarian takeover
[1:20:25.680 --> 1:20:31.200]  but I have to tell you if you go to Bill Gates's Facebook Instagram or Twitter
[1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:38.360]  99% of the comments are devastatingly vicious and see right through him and
[1:20:38.360 --> 1:20:41.840]  what he's doing and that people are now going and researching how he heads up
[1:20:41.840 --> 1:20:48.680]  these big tax-free foundations that literally funded Hitler and it's
[1:20:48.680 --> 1:21:00.160]  incredible absolutely incredible and it's funny that Dr. Shiva I do array was
[1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:05.680]  very respected in MIT trained scientist and breaking all this down brings up
[1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:11.000]  India because if you look at Iran that means Aryan and that's some of the
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:13.600]  groups that went into that area and then took over parts of India and it was a
[1:21:13.600 --> 1:21:17.200]  caste system on how light-skinned you were and that's why Hitler chose to say
[1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:21.640]  we are the Aryans and that's the caste system over in India as the Aryans
[1:21:21.640 --> 1:21:27.360]  down that he was just talking about and that Hitler got massive support in many
[1:21:27.360 --> 1:21:31.480]  of those areas in World War two because this is the elitism of kings and the
[1:21:31.480 --> 1:21:34.560]  priest class that they're the priest class and you're below them it doesn't
[1:21:34.560 --> 1:21:37.840]  matter if you were in ancient Germany or ancient England or ancient China or
[1:21:37.840 --> 1:21:43.040]  ancient India or ancient the Aztecs same crap folks it's these same priesthoods
[1:21:43.040 --> 1:21:47.320]  that do this over and over again and they're not their guardians of humanity
[1:21:47.320 --> 1:21:51.200]  every time they take over they run things in the ground they always show up
[1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:55.520]  take over kill the golden age ruin everything and they starve people and
[1:21:55.520 --> 1:21:59.760]  now they're starving us of sunshine and family and relationships and it's a
[1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:03.760]  very evil thing they're involved in because they were losing control and
[1:22:03.760 --> 1:22:07.520]  this is their attempt to get control they're saying we want world government
[1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:11.680]  we want forced inoculations they're saying families are bad groups together
[1:22:11.680 --> 1:22:16.920]  to spread things this is so alien so anti-human I know and you said this
[1:22:16.920 --> 1:22:20.440]  actually I know you agree I'm gonna put words your mouth that this is a response
[1:22:20.440 --> 1:22:24.240]  to them losing control is is can you elaborate on that and then talk about
[1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:29.640]  how we break out of the caste system yeah so look if you go back six months
[1:22:29.640 --> 1:22:34.200]  before this coronavirus fear mongering hit what was going on you had massive
[1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:38.640]  protests in Hong Kong even in Wuhan six months ago in the place where this
[1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:43.520]  virus was supposedly first found you had people protesting anti-pollution
[1:22:43.520 --> 1:22:48.280]  protests Alex in France remember all those protests Venezuela protests and
[1:22:48.280 --> 1:22:52.760]  then you had the election of two very big populist leaders Donald Trump in the
[1:22:52.760 --> 1:22:58.720]  United States and Narendra Modi in India this event the globalist never the
[1:22:58.720 --> 1:23:04.360]  global elite never wanted to occur so you have massive growth uprisings of
[1:23:04.360 --> 1:23:08.160]  anti-establishment uprisings that's what was taking place and in the United
[1:23:08.160 --> 1:23:11.440]  States don't forget Brazil don't forget everywhere that they admit the new
[1:23:11.440 --> 1:23:16.160]  orders in trouble exactly the new world and in the United States we had the
[1:23:16.160 --> 1:23:20.720]  rise of the anti-vax or medical freedom movement in New Jersey when I got
[1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:24.240]  involved I led one of the most militant protests saying we need to go on the
[1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:29.080]  ground and build the movement versus the so-called anti-vax leaders like Bobby
[1:23:29.080 --> 1:23:32.320]  Kennedy and this guy big tree we're telling people to negotiate with
[1:23:32.320 --> 1:23:35.480]  legislators so the globalists always stick they're not so obvious
[1:23:35.480 --> 1:23:38.920]  establishment leaders who are actually suppressing these movements and then
[1:23:38.920 --> 1:23:44.400]  you absolutely it's clear that Bobby Kennedy is loyal opposition he's leading
[1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:49.120]  white and he was he he's he's you know talks with his accent I'm against big
[1:23:49.120 --> 1:23:53.160]  farmer but the guy endorsed Hillary Clinton three times who's vaccine Queen
[1:23:53.160 --> 1:23:57.680]  and then he came here and endorsed Joe Kennedy who wants to support vaccine
[1:23:57.680 --> 1:24:02.200]  mandates so that's what they do they have their controlled opposition which is
[1:24:02.200 --> 1:24:06.200]  the goal is to control people but never let the movements unleash themselves
[1:24:06.200 --> 1:24:09.080]  bottoms up as though you need a Hollywood celebrity or you need some
[1:24:09.080 --> 1:24:15.600]  Botox people to control these movements that was clear this is 1943 we've taken
[1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:19.400]  most of France we're about to go into Germany this is Zeb Dietrich and the
[1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:23.160]  Battle of the Bulge this is Hitler's final counter offensive exactly they're
[1:24:23.160 --> 1:24:27.960]  losing so what's fundamentally happening here Alex I'm right here so
[1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:32.280]  fundamentally here can you hear me I can't go ahead yeah Alex what's
[1:24:32.280 --> 1:24:37.240]  fundamentally happening is we see the uprising of people the basically the
[1:24:37.240 --> 1:24:41.280]  little weasels like Bill Gates a weasels like Zuckerberg the week and the
[1:24:41.280 --> 1:24:45.480]  controlled opposition they're like holy shit this guy a guy like Shiva is out
[1:24:45.480 --> 1:24:49.120]  there telling people to go on the ground and that's why we won in New Jersey we
[1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:53.840]  won in January 6 13th when we stopped one of the vaccine bills well isn't it
[1:24:53.840 --> 1:24:57.800]  interesting right after that coronavirus fear mongering comes out you
[1:24:57.800 --> 1:25:01.680]  suddenly see this explosive thing so what we're looking at is that people are
[1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:06.640]  starting to rise up people like myself credentialed people can expose these guys
[1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:10.440]  people like you've been doing it for years we're starting to join forces this
[1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:15.160]  scares the bejesus out of them because what we're talking about is we're going
[1:25:15.160 --> 1:25:19.200]  right at them and we can articulate this very properly for example we put out a
[1:25:19.200 --> 1:25:24.480]  petition which says fire Fauci hashtag fire Fauci it was started trending and
[1:25:24.480 --> 1:25:29.280]  we have nearly 40 50,000 people Alex if we show it who signed up for this
[1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:34.240]  nearly 5% of those people we nearly have two to 3,000 medical doctors if you
[1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:38.720]  scroll down you'll see we put up a little bit right there you see 44,000
[1:25:38.720 --> 1:25:42.720]  people have signed up Alex now he has some of his fans trying to make him the
[1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:48.440]  sexiest man on time people magazine and he's it's a ridiculous campaign to put
[1:25:48.440 --> 1:25:51.760]  him out there as a Hollywood celebrity they've only had I think 10,000
[1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:56.720]  signatures okay so what you're talking about is this group which is
[1:25:56.720 --> 1:26:02.000]  interconnected with academia and Hollywood is trying to unleash its fear to
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:06.120]  control us and they literally want to lock us up on our houses and Cuomo and
[1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:09.560]  others are saying it never goes back to normal you never have freedom again
[1:26:09.560 --> 1:26:15.120]  this is beyond Stalin Hitler now this is ridiculous crazy what's going on one
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:18.600]  of the things is let's talk about right now how horrible what they're doing
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:22.520]  let's take the people are seriously immunocompromised and critically ill
[1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:26.720]  what are they doing to those people well their lungs are being filled up with you
[1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:30.680]  know fluid from the cytokine storm which is a compromise immune system
[1:26:30.680 --> 1:26:36.600]  attacking itself instead of giving those people high dose IV vitamin C proven
[1:26:36.600 --> 1:26:41.520]  over and over and over again well they admit even the Wall Street Journal that
[1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:46.080]  they're that it's people are dying like a Spanish flu from the autoimmune issue
[1:26:46.080 --> 1:26:50.240]  they don't need more air in their lungs they need to have some Benadryl
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:55.160]  basically I mean this is crazy exactly Benadryl vitamin C's antiviral high
[1:26:55.160 --> 1:27:00.080]  dose it has to be high dose we got to go to the 15 20 milligram and a gram I'm
[1:27:00.080 --> 1:27:04.040]  not a MIT doctor like you are but that's in the mainline history that the most
[1:27:04.040 --> 1:27:07.360]  deadly flu is don't kill you with the virus it's the body's autoimmune
[1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:11.680]  response exact feasting and that that's what's doing this these people are just
[1:27:11.680 --> 1:27:15.080]  like somebody with a bee sting they can't breathe and then instead of like
[1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:18.480]  giving them Benadryl or vitamin C they just go oh we'll cram a ventilator down
[1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:23.400]  your throat and that ruins your lungs even worse right so so what's what's
[1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:27.960]  really sick and that's why I think people are getting this because most
[1:27:27.960 --> 1:27:31.760]  people who work with their hands you know doctors that in New York to treat
[1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:35.000]  hundreds of patients are saying this exactly they're seeing people get
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:38.920]  hypoxia they said this looks like a guy got dropped on top of a mountain so the
[1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:42.280]  bottom line is they don't know how to handle the critical critically care
[1:27:42.280 --> 1:27:45.920]  because it's about money I know that if somebody's having an autoimmune response
[1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:49.520]  you give them Benadryl and vitamin C why the hell don't these doctors know that
[1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:54.200]  Alex that's a question because their education is big pharma education these
[1:27:54.200 --> 1:27:59.200]  doctors have golden handcuffs handcuffs they're basically victims of a medical
[1:27:59.200 --> 1:28:03.380]  biopharma education model it's not about nutrition it's not about seeing the
[1:28:03.380 --> 1:28:07.120]  body as a system and this is all of the news that you only do what the World
[1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:10.760]  Health Organization says it tells you what to do and we have the videos the
[1:28:10.760 --> 1:28:14.120]  World Health Organization saying we've never studied vaccines we don't know
[1:28:14.120 --> 1:28:16.880]  what to do with any of this we're just told by Bill Gates what to do and Bill
[1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:20.720]  Gates is a psychotic eugenicist listen Dr. Shiva you've got to come back
[1:28:20.720 --> 1:28:24.680]  sheba4sinnet.com we love you I'm gonna get on this bandwagon I was gonna

[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:31.880]  that bandwagon he should be fired these guys should be indicted and thrown in
[1:28:31.880 --> 1:28:35.800]  jail for crimes against humanity and it's time we have a revolution in this
[1:28:35.800 --> 1:28:39.920]  country it's the only way forward I think Dr. Shiva needs an M4 show he's

[1:30:06.800 --> 1:30:11.840]  and now mr. Fauci at the NIH last night in the press conference standing right
[1:30:11.840 --> 1:30:16.360]  next to president said we're gonna have a global lockdown because he talked to
[1:30:16.360 --> 1:30:22.920]  world leaders until not one more person is dying or one more person is
[1:30:22.920 --> 1:30:27.920]  infected the videos posted on info wars dot com ladies and gentlemen that sets
[1:30:27.920 --> 1:30:32.680]  the precedent where not one person can die from the flu not one person can die
[1:30:32.680 --> 1:30:37.040]  from a cold everyone will be surveilled in lifetime by their cell phones and
[1:30:37.040 --> 1:30:43.320]  apps and drones and an absolute straight jacket of pure medical tyranny and
[1:30:43.320 --> 1:30:46.840]  remember it's big pharma that has a level for bio weapons labs that keeps
[1:30:46.840 --> 1:30:51.840]  leaking all these man-made viruses they're holding us all hostage oh and he

[1:33:06.720 --> 1:33:25.560]  oh here she comes she's a free world record deep state eugenicist medical
[1:33:25.560 --> 1:33:33.640]  exact architecture of this globalist operation is they preplanned it all we
[1:33:33.640 --> 1:33:38.520]  watched them build it we warned the people and now you think things are bad
[1:33:38.520 --> 1:33:50.640]  this is only the beginning I'm not trying to scare you I'm trying to get you
[1:33:50.640 --> 1:33:55.880]  to move it's like your house is on fire you're in a trance and I'm your
[1:33:55.880 --> 1:34:00.960]  neighbor I see fire shooting out the top floor now look through and see it
[1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:05.480]  sitting on your couch in a trance I'm gonna go knock on the door I'm gonna
[1:34:05.480 --> 1:34:10.120]  bang if you don't get up I'm gonna knock it down I'm gonna come in and say hey
[1:34:10.120 --> 1:34:16.480]  your house is on fire the smoke pouring in here where are your children there are
[1:34:16.480 --> 1:34:22.280]  too many people my children need to die humans are bad humans are bad that's
[1:34:22.280 --> 1:34:31.000]  what we're all taught so we've seen first the Hollywood actors and then the
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:38.680]  religious yogis of India have come out and just all the establishment and said
[1:34:38.680 --> 1:34:45.120]  humans are the problem we deserve COVID-19 we're bad
[1:34:45.120 --> 1:34:50.200]  well here it is Pope says pandemic could be nature's revenge for ignoring
[1:34:50.200 --> 1:34:56.480]  climate change not God's revenge nature because he's an occultist he's a
[1:34:56.480 --> 1:35:02.080]  globalist he's a pedophile ring leader and protector so that's just some of the
[1:35:02.080 --> 1:35:12.360]  news we've got there but let me go ahead and respond to this because I know the
[1:35:12.360 --> 1:35:19.880]  Democratic Party and George Soros and all those other globalists to have their
[1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:30.480]  minions tuned in so we go ahead and cover what they want me to cover coming
[1:35:30.480 --> 1:35:38.360]  under attack personally does not upset me I mean one day if they grabbed me and
[1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:44.880]  put me in a straight jacket and take me out to a field and shoot me in the back
[1:35:44.880 --> 1:35:49.280]  of the head I expect something like that because I've been in this fight so long
[1:35:49.280 --> 1:35:55.200]  and I committed to that a long time ago and my commitments are real doesn't mean
[1:35:55.200 --> 1:36:04.880]  I enjoy those commitments I really enjoy them because in this universe that's the
[1:36:04.880 --> 1:36:11.240]  only currency that counts he's being real and doing what you say you're gonna
[1:36:11.240 --> 1:36:17.120]  do doing the best job you can to be an honorable person and so that's why in
[1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:23.200]  all their attacks and all their constructed frauds they always say
[1:36:23.200 --> 1:36:28.960]  that I'm not for real and I'm a scammer and I'm a fraud and I'm a fake and I'm
[1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:34.840]  an actor and all this stuff that everybody knows isn't true you see the
[1:36:34.840 --> 1:36:38.480]  academics know the globalists have a plan to sterilize you through vaccines
[1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:46.040]  and give you cancer they just know they lose their jobs when they do that but
[1:36:46.040 --> 1:36:49.720]  still I've had dinner with and camped out with and visited with a lot of famous
[1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:54.200]  academics that aren't like dr. Shiva who we had on earlier who's a prestigious
[1:36:54.200 --> 1:37:01.120]  scientist he's willing to fight they just run but they told me all this they
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:09.280]  told me how right I was 20 years ago well I'm not gonna just run to the
[1:37:09.280 --> 1:37:17.080]  countryside and hope I can live on a few more decades and get left alone I'm
[1:37:17.080 --> 1:37:24.680]  gonna organize humans to fight this so let's cover the facts right here you
[1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:31.520]  saw media matters towards Soros a month ago put an edited tape out out of
[1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:41.760]  context where I was talking about how the nano silver company we use has
[1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:51.560]  patented FDA approved over-the-counter sale of a wound gel that sold in all
[1:37:51.560 --> 1:38:01.880]  major stores and that were private labeling American biotech labs and they
[1:38:01.880 --> 1:38:06.440]  edited that together falsely that's what they do to say that I said it cures
[1:38:06.440 --> 1:38:17.440]  coronavirus or treats it I never said that I said that if you put a silver
[1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:22.960]  molecule of certain type up against bacteria and viruses that it attacks
[1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:26.120]  them that doesn't mean it gets into your lungs and saves you once something's
[1:38:26.120 --> 1:38:32.000]  already going on there and it wasn't the intent to say that but I believe even
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:35.560]  the way the laws are written it's unconstitutional if I want to say that I
[1:38:35.560 --> 1:38:42.000]  should be able to say that but big pharma with all their deadly vaccines and
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:48.760]  all their drugs and a quarter million people the CDC admits much higher die
[1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:54.360]  each year from drug overdoses that are prescribed or medical malpractice it's
[1:38:54.360 --> 1:38:57.760]  probably way higher I mean I've got a lot of family died when they went in for a
[1:38:57.760 --> 1:39:02.760]  surgery and they died of an infection how many people you know like that and the
[1:39:02.760 --> 1:39:06.600]  vaccine makers have this multi-billion dollar fund every year that's secrets
[1:39:06.600 --> 1:39:11.720]  it's 1986 that pays out to the vaccine damage and they go on the news and say
[1:39:11.720 --> 1:39:16.600]  so so these guys are monsters and now they're trying to tell the president he
[1:39:16.600 --> 1:39:19.920]  can't promote zinc you know you're the president you keep your mouth shut don't
[1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:23.280]  say what studies show don't say what medical doctors say shut up he and he's
[1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:27.360]  like yes I'm sorry I mean because it's the new medical tyranny we have to bow
[1:39:27.360 --> 1:39:31.480]  down to them because Bill and Melinda Gates fund them and Bill and Melinda
[1:39:31.480 --> 1:39:37.480]  Gates are you know saying they openly want to kill the population so I get
[1:39:37.480 --> 1:39:41.640]  this letter from the New York AG and it says if you are misrepresenting this is
[1:39:41.640 --> 1:39:45.920]  the case that a few of your shows might might have been interpreted as such you
[1:39:45.920 --> 1:39:48.680]  shouldn't say this cures or treats it we go well we don't think it cures or
[1:39:48.680 --> 1:39:52.920]  treats it and here's what we've said and we send them all the stuff like oh
[1:39:52.920 --> 1:39:58.280]  thanks a lot thank you we're closing this case for now that I see the attorney
[1:39:58.280 --> 1:40:01.800]  general in New York saying Jones is still saying he cures at all and we're
[1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:07.240]  gonna get him maybe doesn't stop and I'm just like couple weeks ago I listen to
[1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:10.360]  this is over let's just stop selling this even though it's in all the stores
[1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:16.720]  because they keep misrepresenting and I don't want people thinking that we have
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:20.600]  the cure to something because they're saying it through a strong man they've
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:27.440]  built and so yesterday morning we're writing a letter to the New York
[1:40:27.440 --> 1:40:30.840]  Attorney General saying you know what we're gonna stop selling this because
[1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:34.200]  you keep saying that we're saying it cures things and we were asking you to
[1:40:34.200 --> 1:40:39.920]  stop misrepresenting us and saying that email comes in from the FDA it's
[1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:44.960]  coordinating with the Soros funded attorney general there on record and
[1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:50.240]  they say what's saying you have a drug that treats and cures things which we
[1:40:50.240 --> 1:40:55.040]  didn't say and by the way take these YouTube videos down that are my YouTube
[1:40:55.040 --> 1:41:00.760]  channel they don't even know how that works okay some edited media matters
[1:41:00.760 --> 1:41:03.520]  that how about media matters takes the video down it's so evil the edited
[1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:07.240]  video well then how about so oh no Soros leaves us up he's he's you know he
[1:41:07.240 --> 1:41:12.080]  he's an actual Nazi collaborator so he can do it every once and so they run
[1:41:12.080 --> 1:41:17.520]  these headlines all over the country ABC news see everywhere Jones caught
[1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:22.800]  selling fake corona cures and scams in full force founder Alex Jones will stop
[1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:27.280]  selling fake coronavirus silver cures FDA says where do I say cure where do I
[1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:32.400]  know where they just make this up feds warn Alex Jones to stop hogging
[1:41:32.400 --> 1:41:38.320]  coronavirus scams daily beast they first put out FDA warns Alex Jones to stop
[1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:42.680]  promoting false coronavirus cures where where did I say that nowhere they just
[1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:47.680]  make that up the FDA doesn't say that either the letter FDA warns Alex Jones
[1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:55.040]  about misbranded coronavirus cures did not say that and it goes on on thousands
[1:41:55.040 --> 1:42:03.640]  of articles folks now just they republish him think about the crime that the
[1:42:03.640 --> 1:42:08.160]  mainstream media commits when they sit there and say we have a cure to something
[1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:14.200]  we never said that you know I'm stopping selling this while I prepare with lawyers
[1:42:14.200 --> 1:42:18.520]  to sue the media and I have to sue over this because people can't say things in
[1:42:18.520 --> 1:42:23.960]  my name and then say I'm a fraudster I have to I have to sue these groups because
[1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:27.840]  I have to at least challenge it court so that so that they're not misrepresenting
[1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:33.800]  me and lying like this but that's a whole nother issue this ties in everybody
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:40.280]  I'm gonna show you when we come back that I mean I said this on air I guess the
[1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:47.960]  FDA and others didn't listen we have the FDA approval letter right here for what

[1:43:45.480 --> 1:43:49.840]  boost our overall health and wellness.
[1:43:54.800 --> 1:44:02.160]  Something huge is happening all over the United States on ABC CBS NBC on local
[1:44:02.160 --> 1:44:06.160]  Fox affiliates but only local ones they're having medical doctors on who
[1:44:06.160 --> 1:44:11.040]  successfully treated their patients with 100% recovery rates with hydroxy
[1:44:11.040 --> 1:44:16.120]  chloroquine but you've got to have the zinc this is a known fact but national
[1:44:16.120 --> 1:44:21.560]  news other than Fox will not carry it and when Tucker Carlson Laura Ingram and
[1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:24.720]  Sean Hannity covered it and had medical doctors talk about it they got
[1:44:24.720 --> 1:44:29.160]  demonized and Fox had them basically shut up but they've been vindicated info
[1:44:29.160 --> 1:44:33.440]  wars has been vindicated we were saying at first with experts we had on air we
[1:44:33.440 --> 1:44:38.160]  got attacked nationally and they said take us off the air Google took our app
[1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:42.640]  away saying that we were putting out fake cures for saying hydroxy chloroquine
[1:44:42.640 --> 1:44:46.880]  zinc and CPAC but all we were doing was reporting with medical journals were
[1:44:46.880 --> 1:44:50.560]  saying big pharma and the global is one you stick and dead and they don't want
[1:44:50.560 --> 1:44:57.840]  you to boost your immune system screw them I don't need to remind you how four
[1:44:57.840 --> 1:45:01.440]  years ago I told you the polls against Trump were fake he was winning by a
[1:45:01.440 --> 1:45:06.240]  giant margin but election fraud almost stole the election from Trump and the
[1:45:06.240 --> 1:45:11.360]  American people well now they're pushing the idea that oh cancel the
[1:45:11.360 --> 1:45:16.160]  Republican-Democrat conventions maybe cancel the election a year like the
[1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:21.600]  Olympics that's because they know Trump in every internal scientific poll is 20
[1:45:21.600 --> 1:45:27.120]  points ahead of the brain damage by so they can say sir you look big like the
[1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:31.160]  Olympics let's back it off a year and then you'll still win in a year after
[1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:35.240]  you fix the crisis no they need more time to cook up an assassination an
[1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:39.400]  economic collapse a new virus Trump needs to say no in America we keep
[1:45:39.400 --> 1:45:44.120]  elections on time have the elections win by a landslide and not give the
[1:45:44.120 --> 1:45:49.200]  globalist what they want Hillary Biden they all want to suspend the election we
[1:45:49.200 --> 1:45:53.240]  shouldn't give them what they want we need to have a vote in America and
[1:45:53.240 --> 1:46:00.320]  reelect Trump 2020 what's amazing about the US Constitution Bill of Rights is
[1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:06.120]  that even though it's 240 years old it's more pertinent and more powerful today
[1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:11.400]  than it's ever been we look at the huge AI takeover and total surveillance of
[1:46:11.400 --> 1:46:15.800]  our lives and the tyranny that comes with it the oppression and it's all
[1:46:15.800 --> 1:46:22.000]  linked to not having due process and not having a fourth amendment against being
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:29.560]  illegally surveilled it's all predicated on having no privacy if we
[1:46:29.560 --> 1:46:32.920]  simply embrace the Bill of Rights a Constitution and force that against big
[1:46:32.920 --> 1:46:37.560]  tech they would never get away with this but because we're not enforcing our
[1:46:37.560 --> 1:46:42.120]  Bill of Rights a Constitution based in common sense the bottom is falling out
[1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:47.880]  and the sky is just the beginning it's certainly not the limit that's why we
[1:46:47.880 --> 1:46:51.600]  rediscovering what made America great I want the Renaissance is all about true
[1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:56.520]  human empowerment it begins in infowars.com
[1:46:56.520 --> 1:47:03.080]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:47:18.920 --> 1:47:26.240]  defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic it's Alex Jones
[1:47:26.240 --> 1:47:35.000]  all right I'm Alex Jones your host don't open the phones up and get you a
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:39.080]  ton of news people being dragged from buses who are coughing crowds attacking
[1:47:39.080 --> 1:47:43.360]  people as the divide and conquerors the mind control works really good and I'm
[1:47:43.360 --> 1:47:49.520]  Alex Jones your host so another big national news story yesterday Alex
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:54.800]  Jones refuses to stop selling coronavirus fake cures ever said that they
[1:47:54.800 --> 1:47:59.200]  have no video none of it's true but they have the New York Attorney General I
[1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:03.720]  might be a sock puppet of George Soros when he put her in there on record she
[1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:08.120]  swore to take down Trump all of it saying I order you to stop selling these
[1:48:08.120 --> 1:48:12.440]  cures fake cures well then you actually get the letter doesn't say this as well
[1:48:12.440 --> 1:48:14.920]  these might be misconstrued what you said here and there we go you're right
[1:48:14.920 --> 1:48:20.800]  we'll put a bigger discrump clamor up and do this and that and then the FDA who
[1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:28.160]  they're tattling to filled with globalists they don't care about the
[1:48:28.160 --> 1:48:30.760]  fentanyl out of China or the fact that almost all the drugs out of China
[1:48:30.760 --> 1:48:35.400]  are tainted and poisonous that's all fine just like apples got slave camps and
[1:48:35.400 --> 1:48:38.800]  three million Uighurs and concentration camps well Tim Cooks gay so that's all
[1:48:38.800 --> 1:48:43.000]  right I mean like oh I mean death camps are cool just don't just don't give
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  anybody you know any any antibacterial I mean this is this is insane so why do
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  you think I'd go on air and say the wounds yell that this company has is
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:07.520]  sold over the counter over the country and has an FDA letter that authorizes
[1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:11.080]  them to do so okay so they went along with that that's why I went with a
[1:49:11.080 --> 1:49:15.880]  company that's got a bunch of these approvals and sell stuff to hospitals I'm
[1:49:15.880 --> 1:49:19.880]  like let me get the best let me get who's approved because you go to Whole Foods
[1:49:19.880 --> 1:49:24.960]  or Amazon all Jeff Bezos or any other major grocery store it's everywhere CVS
[1:49:24.960 --> 1:49:33.720]  puts up their own line of silvers and they've got approval so I'm on air when
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:36.880]  they start attacking me about this going hey I'm using one of the biggest
[1:49:36.880 --> 1:49:41.000]  firms in the US the military buys it hospitals buy it I've got all the letters
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:51.080]  and they didn't turn around and say that I have a cure for this didn't say that
[1:49:51.080 --> 1:49:56.640]  but that's how they operate in the media so let's go over this here's the letter
[1:49:56.640 --> 1:50:02.600]  from the FDA and they tell me we may rage you we may take you over we may do
[1:50:02.600 --> 1:50:09.200]  all this because you know media matter says so and then you go to Amazon
[1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:13.800]  Amazon itself sells and their merchants sell hundreds of these including
[1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:17.520]  dozens that are private labeled and American biotech labs that calls it
[1:50:17.520 --> 1:50:26.320]  immune boost nano silver but see Alex Jones can't do that
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:33.280]  ATB can Pigley Wigley's can Walgreens can Walmart can but Alex and when Alex
[1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:38.920]  Jones does it he actually goes on air and says oh let me show you the
[1:50:38.920 --> 1:50:45.880]  congressional record in the FDA letter and I guess that's what pisses them off
[1:50:45.880 --> 1:50:50.200]  is that they attack me saying I'm making this up that that that that that that
[1:50:50.200 --> 1:50:54.840]  silver is an antibacterial antiviral that's a fact the Pentagon do them before
[1:50:54.840 --> 1:50:58.040]  the thing that existed that it was a permanent war you're back in the Civil
[1:50:58.040 --> 1:51:06.800]  War said that but the point is even if I was wrong don't I have free speech but
[1:51:06.800 --> 1:51:10.360]  again they put in your mouth something I never I don't want my listeners thinking
[1:51:10.360 --> 1:51:13.960]  if they get a immune gargle or toothpaste from us that they can't get
[1:51:13.960 --> 1:51:17.200]  sick that's a load of crap I've been saying according to medical doctors we
[1:51:17.200 --> 1:51:29.640]  have on to boost your immunity and defend against this vitamin D3 sink things
[1:51:29.640 --> 1:51:35.080]  like that let's see they just ignore that and just edit it together to misrepresent
[1:51:35.080 --> 1:51:39.200]  because I'm the bad guy because I'm exposing the force inoculations the
[1:51:39.200 --> 1:51:43.280]  world government Bill Gates behind this the fact I'm gonna put a biological chip
[1:51:43.280 --> 1:51:47.400]  into you now it's all being announced the fact we have so much credibility they
[1:51:47.400 --> 1:51:55.440]  want us off air they want us arrested so let me show you what's been sent to the
[1:51:55.440 --> 1:51:58.200]  FDA what was sent to the New York Attorney General because the law says if
[1:51:58.200 --> 1:52:01.080]  you've got science to back it up well then you can make that claim I didn't
[1:52:01.080 --> 1:52:06.160]  even make the claim they said but I said here's what I said I said point blank

[1:59:51.240 --> 2:00:02.320]  jones show nearly 2400 years ago in ancient Greece play dough discussed the
[2:00:02.320 --> 2:00:08.520]  importance of population control Aristotle advocated the use of abortion
[2:00:08.520 --> 2:00:16.080]  and infanticide in 1798 an essay on the principle of population was written by
[2:00:16.080 --> 2:00:23.160]  Thomas Malthus he outlined the idea of positive checks which are diseases wars
[2:00:23.160 --> 2:00:29.400]  disasters famines and genocides Malthus believed that these things should be
[2:00:29.400 --> 2:00:34.400]  utilized to increase the death rate and believed that human misery was an
[2:00:34.400 --> 2:00:41.560]  absolute necessary consequence in 1859 Charles Darwin published the origin of
[2:00:41.560 --> 2:00:47.200]  species in it Darwin only hinted at the implications of human populations but
[2:00:47.200 --> 2:00:53.600]  his cousin Sir Francis Galton became obsessed with the idea in 1883 Galton
[2:00:53.600 --> 2:00:58.960]  published inquiries into human faculty and its development wherein he wrote that
[2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:03.640]  his intention is to touch on various topics more or less connected with that
[2:01:03.640 --> 2:01:09.840]  of the cultivation of race or as we might call it with eugenic the term
[2:01:09.840 --> 2:01:16.920]  comes from the Greek word eugenics of noble birth in the early 20th century
[2:01:16.920 --> 2:01:22.360]  eugenics became an academic discipline in universities organizations were formed
[2:01:22.360 --> 2:01:27.840]  and funded to win public support the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and the Cold
[2:01:27.840 --> 2:01:32.920]  Spring Harbor Institute rejected the idea that all humans are born equal and
[2:01:32.920 --> 2:01:39.840]  began selling the idea of cultivating a new master race of noble bloodlines
[2:01:39.840 --> 2:01:44.400]  planned parenthood was formed in America by racial eugenics advocate
[2:01:44.400 --> 2:01:51.080]  Margaret Sanger president of IBM Thomas J. Watson established a special
[2:01:51.080 --> 2:01:56.160]  subsidiary in Poland called Watson business machines to assist in the
[2:01:56.160 --> 2:02:01.640]  Nazi invasion of Poland this business continued throughout the war and IBM
[2:02:01.640 --> 2:02:06.960]  managed the entire operation from their headquarters in New York during the
[2:02:06.960 --> 2:02:12.400]  Nuremberg trials the Nazis quoted US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell
[2:02:12.400 --> 2:02:17.560]  Holmes in their own defense they claim that their eugenics program was being
[2:02:17.560 --> 2:02:22.760]  run from the United States the Nazis were rightly admonished for war crimes
[2:02:22.760 --> 2:02:28.520]  but not Thomas Watson he went on to create the IBM World Trade Corporation
[2:02:28.520 --> 2:02:34.400]  and passed IBM on to his son his granddaughter ended up marrying Margaret
[2:02:34.400 --> 2:02:39.560]  Sanger's grandson Bill Gates his father worked on the board for planned
[2:02:39.560 --> 2:02:44.520]  parenthood and his mother worked on the corporate board for IBM who Bill
[2:02:44.520 --> 2:02:51.240]  partnered with to create Microsoft with no medical background Bill Gates then
[2:02:51.240 --> 2:02:56.080]  went on to become the world's foremost pusher of vaccines and population
[2:02:56.080 --> 2:03:02.680]  control do you think this is all coincidence the Bill and Melinda
[2:03:02.680 --> 2:03:11.440]  Gates Foundation funds the WHO the NIH the CDC and the UN and now he is saying
[2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:17.120]  that until we get mass vaccinations we might never be able to gather in groups
[2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:22.440]  and which activities like mass gatherings may be in a certain sense more
[2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:29.880]  optional and so until you're widely vaccinated those may not come back at
[2:03:29.880 --> 2:03:34.560]  all the president's coronavirus response team are all pushing the Bill Gates
[2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:39.440]  vaccination agenda Dr. Fauci is on the leadership counsel for the Bill and
[2:03:39.440 --> 2:03:45.640]  Melinda Gates Foundation in January of 2017 Anthony Fauci told a crowd at
[2:03:45.640 --> 2:03:50.400]  Georgetown University that there would be a surprise outbreak during the Trump
[2:03:50.400 --> 2:03:55.480]  presidency there is no question that there will be a challenge the coming
[2:03:55.480 --> 2:04:00.080]  administration in the arena of infectious diseases both chronic infectious
[2:04:00.080 --> 2:04:04.200]  diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease and we have certainly a large
[2:04:04.200 --> 2:04:10.120]  burden of that but also there will be a surprise outbreak Deborah Birx is a
[2:04:10.120 --> 2:04:14.920]  board member for the Global Fund to fight AIDS tuberculosis and malaria which
[2:04:14.920 --> 2:04:19.000]  was founded by the Gates Foundation and known for millions of dollars of
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:26.080]  fraudulent misuse of funds in October of 2019 Bill Gates sponsored event 201 a
[2:04:26.080 --> 2:04:33.280]  simulation that estimated 65 million people killed by coronavirus in November
[2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:39.440]  of 2019 the Peer Bright Institute funded by Bill Gates was granted European
[2:04:39.440 --> 2:04:48.160]  patent number EP3172319B1 for a coronavirus vaccine that may be used to
[2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:54.080]  treat humans today dr. Fauci says the virus will keep coming back it's
[2:04:54.080 --> 2:04:57.560]  Wednesday morning I was just in a local Austin business that was basically
[2:04:57.560 --> 2:05:02.680]  empty and there were three motorcycle police in there and I said what do you
[2:05:02.680 --> 2:05:07.040]  think of this whole coronavirus thing they're like yeah it looks like it's a
[2:05:07.040 --> 2:05:12.600]  hoax I said yeah you're absolutely right the way it's been handled is a hoax
[2:05:12.600 --> 2:05:17.480]  taking everybody that dies who happens to test positive even though they die of a
[2:05:17.480 --> 2:05:22.400]  heart attack or cancer or diabetes as dying from coronavirus is the big one
[2:05:22.400 --> 2:05:25.400]  and then of course they're also classifying everybody that tests
[2:05:25.400 --> 2:05:32.240]  positive for coronavirus period not just COVID-19 as having it so they're
[2:05:32.240 --> 2:05:35.400]  they're upping a number of cases they're upping a number of deaths but still
[2:05:35.400 --> 2:05:39.560]  more people died this week and last week then died from the coronavirus from
[2:05:39.560 --> 2:05:43.120]  suicide so if anything it's causing divorces and suicide and
[2:05:43.120 --> 2:05:47.800]  stir craziness and basic insanity and a giant power grab with big pharma
[2:05:47.800 --> 2:05:51.240]  preparing a forced inoculation which they even admit will not protect you
[2:05:51.240 --> 2:05:55.080]  from next year's mutation of the coronavirus
[2:06:02.080 --> 2:06:11.200]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[2:06:11.200 --> 2:06:14.640]  lines of the Info War
[2:06:27.600 --> 2:06:33.880]  you learn quite a bit by the enemy's attack profile and coming up next
[2:06:33.880 --> 2:06:36.560]  segment I'm gonna get to a bunch of clips of them demonizing Trump for
[2:06:36.560 --> 2:06:40.480]  hydroxychloroquine again and he's making money off of it this total hoax
[2:06:40.480 --> 2:06:45.040]  when meanwhile nobody criticizes
[2:07:10.480 --> 2:07:13.400]  you
[2:07:40.480 --> 2:08:02.720]  What can we expect in the month of April?
[2:08:02.720 --> 2:08:07.400]  My prediction, riots, looting, and a reckoning for the government.
[2:08:07.400 --> 2:08:11.240]  China and Italy are ahead in quarantine repercussions.
[2:08:11.240 --> 2:08:16.560]  In Palermo, Italy, Sicilian gangs are using social media to coordinate the ransacking of
[2:08:16.560 --> 2:08:17.760]  businesses.
[2:08:17.760 --> 2:08:23.520]  Food and medicine supplies have been halted due to the bankruptcy of delivery services,
[2:08:23.520 --> 2:08:28.960]  and Italian officials are now concerned that the mafia may be preparing to add to the chaos.
[2:08:28.960 --> 2:08:33.400]  It's hard to watch, but this is what desperation looks like.
[2:08:33.400 --> 2:08:44.240]  While in Hubei, China, violent clashes erupted between two provincial police groups and the
[2:08:44.240 --> 2:08:47.600]  people of the area most affected by the coronavirus.
[2:08:47.600 --> 2:08:52.760]  As the Washington Examiner reported, alleged video from the skirmish shows overturned police
[2:08:52.760 --> 2:08:58.080]  vehicles and large groups of people clad with face masks facing off against Chinese police
[2:08:58.080 --> 2:09:01.760]  who attempt to use riot shields to push back the crowd.
[2:09:01.760 --> 2:09:07.640]  Back in America, just how long can Americans endure food shortages, unemployment, diminishing
[2:09:07.640 --> 2:09:27.840]  medical and law enforcement attention, and creeping big brother oppression?
[2:09:27.840 --> 2:09:32.800]  A Twitter post reveals a long line of cars due to food shortages in an area outside of
[2:09:32.800 --> 2:09:34.440]  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[2:09:34.440 --> 2:09:39.680]  In eastern Kentucky, many have taken to hunting and fishing as a primary food source because
[2:09:39.680 --> 2:09:44.200]  the supply of meat is growing scarce and mass hunger is setting in.
[2:09:44.200 --> 2:09:49.960]  Meanwhile, the old style of bartering amongst neighbors is already becoming more commonplace.
[2:09:49.960 --> 2:09:54.920]  This could also be a very positive development as communities become more self-sufficient
[2:09:54.920 --> 2:10:00.560]  or deadly as people turn against each other as domestic violence skyrockets.
[2:10:00.560 --> 2:10:06.240]  As CBS in Sacramento, California reported, right now, as we speak, one in five women
[2:10:06.240 --> 2:10:09.360]  are being assaulted right here in Sacramento County.
[2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:14.360]  The quarantine puts most of the abusers in the home with the family more frequently than
[2:10:14.360 --> 2:10:15.360]  usual.
[2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:20.560]  This, according to Donna Brown, who is a domestic abuse counselor, if unemployment lingers on,
[2:10:20.560 --> 2:10:26.760]  people could get desperate, as CNBC reported, economists at the Fed's St. Louis District
[2:10:26.760 --> 2:10:35.440]  project total employment reductions of 47 million, which would translate to a 32.1% unemployment
[2:10:35.440 --> 2:10:36.440]  rate.
[2:10:36.440 --> 2:10:42.080]  According to a recent analysis of how bad things could get, and as medical workers and
[2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:47.320]  law enforcement get sick, the entire emergency response system faces gridlock.
[2:10:47.320 --> 2:10:52.160]  This pandemic has had a dramatic impact for the NYPD.
[2:10:52.160 --> 2:10:58.600]  Five members of the department have died, and right now, 1,400 more have tested positive.
[2:10:58.600 --> 2:11:04.120]  Police Commissioner Dermot Shea says that he doesn't think the worst has yet to happen.
[2:11:04.120 --> 2:11:09.320]  And if the government takes a let them eat their measly $1,200 cake approach while flaunting
[2:11:09.320 --> 2:11:15.520]  millions to their pockets and those of their donors, and GPS surveillance and the imprisonment
[2:11:15.520 --> 2:11:21.880]  of average citizens increases, and the Bill of Rights takes a backseat to communist style
[2:11:21.880 --> 2:11:22.880]  rule.
[2:11:22.880 --> 2:11:44.480]  In a net bureaucracy that has long thumbed its nose at its true boss, the American people,
[2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:47.320]  police is a reckoning they can't even see coming.
[2:11:47.320 --> 2:11:53.400]  There will be rent strikes, worker strikes, emergency service strikes, police strikes,
[2:11:53.400 --> 2:11:59.360]  delivery strikes, chaos will marinate, so it is incredibly important to make sure you
[2:11:59.360 --> 2:12:01.040]  are prepared right now.
[2:12:01.040 --> 2:12:06.720]  But in the end, one way or another, we will have all learned to be better Americans.
[2:12:06.720 --> 2:12:23.120]  John Bown reporting.
[2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:28.360]  My own science advisor is Bill Gates, so I talked to him, I talked to him the last few
[2:12:28.360 --> 2:12:40.680]  days about it, and he's bullish on the long-term outlook for a universal prevention of it.
[2:12:40.680 --> 2:12:45.760]  And they pump it into media and propaganda and the UN and the NIH and Harvard and all
[2:12:45.760 --> 2:12:46.760]  of it.
[2:12:46.760 --> 2:12:49.720]  And Jeffrey Epstein headed up large parts of their operations.
[2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:50.720]  That's on record.
[2:12:50.720 --> 2:12:58.840]  Bill Gates' father was in high-level secret organizations in the Army and then ran Planned
[2:12:58.840 --> 2:13:04.040]  Parenthood and worked directly with the operatives out of IBM.
[2:13:04.040 --> 2:13:15.360]  When Thomas Watson died, his entire fortune was put in a trust pledged for racial superiority
[2:13:15.360 --> 2:13:18.080]  and eugenics and depopulation.
[2:13:18.080 --> 2:13:23.360]  He won the highest award given by Adolf Hitler, the Third Reich, above Hitler.
[2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:25.520]  These men are not Nazis.
[2:13:25.520 --> 2:13:28.160]  These men created the Nazis.
[2:13:28.160 --> 2:13:33.440]  This is the bigger version of the eugenics record office at Cold Spring Harbor.
[2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:41.240]  The building was built with money from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1927 when eugenics
[2:13:41.240 --> 2:13:49.080]  were generally thought to be a good thing, and the German geneticists thought it was
[2:13:49.080 --> 2:13:57.320]  a good thing, and had a proposed program of sterilization for a large number of genetic
[2:13:57.320 --> 2:14:01.760]  conditions, but it wasn't voted in.
[2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:08.080]  They couldn't get it through the German democracy at the time.
[2:14:08.080 --> 2:14:17.120]  But the moment Hitler came into power, eugenics law was passed within a month, which prescribed
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:22.000]  sterilization for a large number of conditions, including for, say, being schizophrenic in
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:24.440]  a mental hospital.
[2:14:24.440 --> 2:14:34.800]  So very soon afterwards, they started a program of sterilization, which went on until the
[2:14:34.800 --> 2:14:39.840]  war started, with about 600,000 people sterilized.
[2:14:39.840 --> 2:14:45.640]  It was a very thorough program, and they had records on all these people.
[2:14:45.640 --> 2:14:51.040]  And the UN came out and said, a week and a half ago, we want forced inoculations or the
[2:14:51.040 --> 2:14:55.440]  antibodies for COVID-19 before you can travel or have a job, and then they're going to
[2:14:55.440 --> 2:15:00.880]  roll out the apps and the blood test for you to prove you can leave your house that you
[2:15:00.880 --> 2:15:03.720]  have the COVID-19 antibody.
[2:15:03.720 --> 2:15:09.680]  The problem is, we're getting to that moment, is that most people will never come in contact
[2:15:09.680 --> 2:15:10.680]  with it.
[2:15:10.680 --> 2:15:15.800]  So the idea is, you've got to have a pathogen, have a virus, have a potential disease causing
[2:15:15.800 --> 2:15:19.120]  the thing in you, and have the antibodies for it, or you can't have a job.
[2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:23.240]  So you've got to have antibodies for HIV, or antibodies for hepatitis, or you can't
[2:15:23.240 --> 2:15:24.240]  have a job.
[2:15:24.240 --> 2:15:27.320]  What about a cult?
[2:15:27.320 --> 2:15:31.960]  And so, boom, it started getting announced two days ago, the UK, Italy, they're going
[2:15:31.960 --> 2:15:38.800]  to roll it out and say, you've got to have this shot, and you've got to have the antibodies,
[2:15:38.800 --> 2:15:40.760]  or you can't work or leave your house.
[2:15:40.760 --> 2:16:10.720]  That's all being announced.
[2:16:10.720 --> 2:16:15.480]  If we've learned anything from China and Italy, it's that quarantines and enforced
[2:16:15.480 --> 2:16:18.920]  lockdowns are just a few days away here in the US.
[2:16:18.920 --> 2:16:24.400]  Listen, while dehydrated food is becoming scarce, you can still get enough open pollinated heirloom
[2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:27.080]  seeds to grow a one-acre crisis garden.
[2:16:27.080 --> 2:16:31.960]  The truth is, growing nutrient-dense vegetables in the days ahead may actually be the single
[2:16:31.960 --> 2:16:33.880]  most important thing you do.
[2:16:33.880 --> 2:16:39.360]  Go to survivalseedbank.com and watch the new video to understand the nature of the threat.
[2:16:39.360 --> 2:16:41.360]  Lockdowns could be life-saving.
[2:16:41.360 --> 2:16:43.920]  Lockdowns can last from six to eight weeks.

[2:17:59.120 --> 2:18:03.200]  It targets those who already have pre-existing conditions, compromised immune systems, and
[2:18:03.200 --> 2:18:05.600]  those over 70, particularly bad.
[2:18:05.600 --> 2:18:09.920]  It is deadly, but the globalists are hyping it as an economic and psychological warfare
[2:18:09.920 --> 2:18:13.560]  weapon to implement martial law and throw Trump out of office.
[2:18:13.560 --> 2:18:18.240]  But regardless, the mainstream media will not tell you about natural compounds that
[2:18:18.240 --> 2:18:21.720]  are known to be extremely antiviral like zinc.

[2:20:04.680 --> 2:20:09.200]  Over the past few weeks, we've heard a lot about the drug hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:09.200 --> 2:20:10.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:10.200 --> 2:20:11.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:11.200 --> 2:20:12.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:12.200 --> 2:20:13.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:13.200 --> 2:20:14.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:14.200 --> 2:20:15.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:15.200 --> 2:20:16.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:16.200 --> 2:20:17.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:17.200 --> 2:20:18.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:18.200 --> 2:20:19.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:19.200 --> 2:20:20.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:20.200 --> 2:20:21.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:21.200 --> 2:20:22.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:22.200 --> 2:20:23.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:23.200 --> 2:20:24.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:24.200 --> 2:20:25.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:25.200 --> 2:20:26.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:26.200 --> 2:20:27.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:27.200 --> 2:20:28.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:28.200 --> 2:20:29.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:29.200 --> 2:20:30.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:30.200 --> 2:20:31.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:31.200 --> 2:20:32.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:32.200 --> 2:20:33.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:33.200 --> 2:20:34.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:34.200 --> 2:20:35.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:35.200 --> 2:20:36.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:36.200 --> 2:20:37.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:37.200 --> 2:20:38.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:38.200 --> 2:20:39.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:39.200 --> 2:20:40.200]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:20:40.200 --> 2:20:43.080]  And I'm seeing people dying.
[2:20:43.080 --> 2:20:46.920]  And I've seen people that are going to die without it.
[2:20:46.920 --> 2:20:48.160]  What?
[2:20:48.160 --> 2:20:49.960]  We've got the treatment.
[2:20:49.960 --> 2:20:51.680]  We're going to cure it.
[2:20:51.680 --> 2:20:53.400]  We're going to.
[2:20:53.400 --> 2:20:55.280]  What?
[2:20:55.280 --> 2:20:57.000]  He was snake-lessed up?
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:20:58.280]  I feel good about it.
[2:20:58.280 --> 2:21:00.720]  Turns out, actual doctors do not
[2:21:00.720 --> 2:21:04.000]  suggest taking hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19,
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:05.760]  because there is no evidence you have to suggest
[2:21:05.760 --> 2:21:06.800]  it protects against the virus.
[2:21:06.800 --> 2:21:09.040]  I don't think we could definitively say it works.
[2:21:09.040 --> 2:21:11.440]  Not only was Fauci mocking President Trump
[2:21:11.440 --> 2:21:14.000]  for talking about it, but you had Governor Whitmer
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:16.120]  in Michigan threatening physicians,
[2:21:16.120 --> 2:21:19.600]  I'll take your license if you prescribe hydroxychloroquine.
[2:21:19.600 --> 2:21:22.480]  And telling pharmacists, don't fill any prescriptions
[2:21:22.480 --> 2:21:23.520]  for hydroxychloroquine.
[2:21:23.520 --> 2:21:26.360]  And while many on the left are using the coronavirus outbreak
[2:21:26.360 --> 2:21:29.840]  to attack President Trump, one Democrat state lawmaker
[2:21:29.840 --> 2:21:32.320]  is crediting him with saving her life.
[2:21:32.320 --> 2:21:34.320]  If President Trump had not talked about this,
[2:21:34.320 --> 2:21:36.680]  it would not be something that's accessible for anyone
[2:21:36.680 --> 2:21:38.560]  to be able to get that right now.
[2:21:38.560 --> 2:21:40.400]  Because I did have a difficult time
[2:21:40.400 --> 2:21:42.920]  even that day obtaining the medication
[2:21:42.920 --> 2:21:45.440]  because of an order that was put down in my state.
[2:21:45.440 --> 2:21:46.440]  It saved my life.
[2:21:46.440 --> 2:21:49.960]  I want to tell you about a 96-year-old man in Florida
[2:21:49.960 --> 2:21:52.840]  who said one night, I don't think I'm going to make it.
[2:21:52.840 --> 2:21:53.880]  I feel very weak.
[2:21:53.880 --> 2:21:55.240]  The end is coming.
[2:21:55.240 --> 2:21:55.920]  I'm coughing.
[2:21:55.920 --> 2:21:56.680]  I'm short of breath.
[2:21:56.680 --> 2:21:58.440]  I can't get up from the couch.
[2:21:58.440 --> 2:22:01.160]  The next day, he was on hydroxychloroquine
[2:22:01.160 --> 2:22:03.520]  and antibiotics for his cardiologist.
[2:22:03.520 --> 2:22:04.680]  He got up the next day.
[2:22:04.680 --> 2:22:05.800]  He was fine.
[2:22:05.800 --> 2:22:07.320]  This man is my father.
[2:22:07.320 --> 2:22:09.400]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:22:09.400 --> 2:22:12.440]  Why is any network running these press conferences
[2:22:12.440 --> 2:22:17.640]  where he keeps talking about an unproven drug that
[2:22:17.640 --> 2:22:19.680]  might work for malaria, might work for lupus,
[2:22:19.680 --> 2:22:21.040]  doesn't work for this?
[2:22:21.040 --> 2:22:23.880]  A lot of people would say, follow the money.
[2:22:23.880 --> 2:22:27.280]  There's got to be some sort of financial tie
[2:22:27.280 --> 2:22:31.040]  to someone somewhere that has the president pushing
[2:22:31.040 --> 2:22:32.040]  this repeatedly.
[2:22:32.040 --> 2:22:35.200]  Turns out he has a financial stake in the company that
[2:22:35.200 --> 2:22:36.800]  makes the drug.
[2:22:36.800 --> 2:22:37.640]  Of course he does.
[2:22:37.640 --> 2:22:39.400]  The press honestly is out of control.
[2:22:39.400 --> 2:22:41.400]  The level of dishonesty is out of control.
[2:22:41.400 --> 2:22:44.160]  If Trump is for it, they're against it,
[2:22:44.160 --> 2:22:46.760]  even if it might save American lives,
[2:22:46.760 --> 2:22:48.040]  what reactive children they are.
[2:22:48.040 --> 2:22:48.840]  He's got to stop.
[2:22:48.840 --> 2:22:49.720]  He's not.
[2:22:49.720 --> 2:22:51.560]  We don't want a drug pusher for president.
[2:22:51.560 --> 2:22:53.680]  Jean Robinson, you write in The Washington Post,
[2:22:53.680 --> 2:22:57.240]  the one word that proves why President Trump should not
[2:22:57.240 --> 2:22:59.400]  be president, what is it?
[2:22:59.400 --> 2:23:00.840]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:23:00.840 --> 2:23:02.120]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:23:02.120 --> 2:23:04.520]  Experts say there isn't enough clinical data
[2:23:04.520 --> 2:23:07.440]  to show it's effective for coronavirus.
[2:23:07.440 --> 2:23:09.120]  And it is some serious side effects.
[2:23:09.120 --> 2:23:12.480]  The terrible publicity this drug has received just
[2:23:12.480 --> 2:23:14.640]  relentlessly over the past three weeks.
[2:23:14.640 --> 2:23:16.960]  This is a crackpot cure.
[2:23:16.960 --> 2:23:18.000]  This is snake oil.
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:19.760]  We've got the treatment.
[2:23:19.760 --> 2:23:21.240]  We're going to cure it.
[2:23:21.240 --> 2:23:25.240]  Do you think that has made physicians hesitant to try it
[2:23:25.240 --> 2:23:26.000]  as a therapy?
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:28.480]  No, I think physicians go with what works.
[2:23:28.480 --> 2:23:30.840]  And a go to evidence straight from the patient's mouths
[2:23:30.840 --> 2:23:32.240]  are attesting to its success.
[2:23:32.240 --> 2:23:35.680]  And here's what I consider to be the secret weapon.
[2:23:35.680 --> 2:23:36.920]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[2:23:36.920 --> 2:23:39.160]  I don't think we could definitively say it works.
[2:23:39.160 --> 2:23:41.000]  Well, add my name to those personal accounts
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:42.720]  because I am feeling better.
[2:23:42.720 --> 2:23:44.680]  You guys saved my life.
[2:23:44.680 --> 2:23:48.160]  And you know me better.
[2:23:48.160 --> 2:23:51.040]  If I could cover my face with my hands, I would.
[2:23:51.040 --> 2:23:52.000]  You're prescribing it.
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:54.400]  And it is working for COVID-19 patients.
[2:23:54.400 --> 2:23:57.360]  Every patient I've prescribed it to has been very, very ill.
[2:23:57.360 --> 2:24:00.640]  And within 8 to 12 hours, they were basically symptom-free.
[2:24:00.640 --> 2:24:04.200]  And so, politically, I am seeing a resolution.
[2:24:07.200 --> 2:24:08.080]  All right.
[2:24:08.080 --> 2:24:11.840]  Darren McBrain just posted that video minutes ago
[2:24:11.840 --> 2:24:19.480]  to newswars.com, infowars.com, and Bandai Video.
[2:24:19.480 --> 2:24:21.680]  But when I sit there, thank you for the coffee.
[2:24:21.680 --> 2:24:24.240]  When I sit there and I watch something like that,
[2:24:24.240 --> 2:24:25.200]  it doesn't make me laugh.
[2:24:25.200 --> 2:24:28.600]  It makes me want to tear people's heads off
[2:24:28.600 --> 2:24:33.520]  because they have all these studies on coronaviruses
[2:24:33.520 --> 2:24:37.920]  and SARS before with the damn hydroxychloroquine.
[2:24:37.920 --> 2:24:39.680]  It's like saying penicillins good
[2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:41.440]  if you've got a bacterial infection.
[2:24:41.440 --> 2:24:43.640]  It's known.
[2:24:43.640 --> 2:24:45.520]  And it's already live at infowars.com.
[2:24:45.520 --> 2:24:49.360]  The hydroxychloroquine shovel, Dr. Trump to the rescue.
[2:24:49.360 --> 2:24:52.520]  So Trump tries to give people hope five weeks ago.
[2:24:52.520 --> 2:24:55.600]  And he goes, hey, people that get it early,
[2:24:55.600 --> 2:24:56.280]  they're doing great.
[2:24:56.280 --> 2:24:57.760]  And then he learns, oh, you got to have a zinc, too.
[2:24:57.760 --> 2:25:00.400]  He says that, they go, shut up.
[2:25:00.400 --> 2:25:01.720]  And again, I keep harping on this.
[2:25:01.720 --> 2:25:04.240]  I've got hundreds of articles, incredible videos,
[2:25:04.240 --> 2:25:07.680]  huge breaking news from Fort Hood,
[2:25:07.680 --> 2:25:09.400]  just stuff that pisses me off.
[2:25:09.400 --> 2:25:13.960]  And I'm being honest, it's manly to get mad,
[2:25:13.960 --> 2:25:16.680]  but it's also manly to be able to control yourself.
[2:25:16.680 --> 2:25:17.680]  And I'm really trying.
[2:25:17.680 --> 2:25:19.320]  The crew's great putting up with me.
[2:25:19.320 --> 2:25:24.200]  But everybody I know, men and women, every race, color,
[2:25:24.200 --> 2:25:27.240]  and creed, are just like, we want to go to war.
[2:25:29.720 --> 2:25:32.480]  That's why folks are burning down the cell towers.
[2:25:32.480 --> 2:25:34.720]  And I'm not saying go out and do that.
[2:25:34.720 --> 2:25:36.360]  You need to expose it politically.
[2:25:36.360 --> 2:25:38.040]  You need to sue these jerks.
[2:25:38.040 --> 2:25:40.520]  That costs way more than their stupid cell tower.
[2:25:40.520 --> 2:25:43.160]  That technology is super cheap.
[2:25:43.160 --> 2:25:46.560]  One of those dammed, the tower cost $20,000.
[2:25:46.560 --> 2:25:49.800]  One of those dammed, the tower cost 20 times
[2:25:49.800 --> 2:25:52.200]  with the stupid microwave oven.
[2:25:52.200 --> 2:25:54.080]  I mean, you know, microwave ovens are cheap, folks.
[2:25:54.080 --> 2:25:56.520]  That's all those are, big-ass microwave ovens,
[2:25:56.520 --> 2:25:58.720]  hanging up there, cooking you and your babies.
[2:26:00.920 --> 2:26:04.760]  Well, the studies only show a 35% increase in brain tumors.
[2:26:07.560 --> 2:26:12.360]  So I've got a lot to cover here, and a lot to go over.
[2:26:12.360 --> 2:26:23.480]  But people ask me, how am I handling all this?
[2:26:23.480 --> 2:26:25.440]  And it pisses me off.
[2:26:25.440 --> 2:26:27.360]  We're all in this together.
[2:26:27.360 --> 2:26:29.920]  That's why it's sick to ask me how I'm handling it.
[2:26:29.920 --> 2:26:32.840]  Do you understand you're the target of this, folks?
[2:26:32.840 --> 2:26:33.920]  I'm pro-human.
[2:26:33.920 --> 2:26:37.280]  I'm not siding on with a bunch of creepy fellow humans
[2:26:37.280 --> 2:26:39.080]  that are out to screw over humanity
[2:26:39.080 --> 2:26:43.440]  and merge with machines and cause some dark force told them
[2:26:43.440 --> 2:26:45.400]  to.
[2:26:45.400 --> 2:26:47.720]  I mean, I'm not like jumping off cliffs ever.
[2:26:47.720 --> 2:26:52.560]  I mean, this is, you know, for me, this is a no-brainer.
[2:26:52.560 --> 2:26:55.080]  And that's why I'll say this a trillion times
[2:26:55.080 --> 2:26:56.680]  before I die, hopefully.
[2:26:56.680 --> 2:27:00.440]  I've already said it probably 5,000 times.
[2:27:00.440 --> 2:27:04.320]  It's sick to call into the broadcast
[2:27:04.320 --> 2:27:07.520]  and tell me how great I am, and tell me the great job I'm
[2:27:07.520 --> 2:27:09.960]  doing, what all I'm doing is treading water
[2:27:09.960 --> 2:27:11.680]  in a sea of evil.
[2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:12.600]  What, I want to live?
[2:27:12.600 --> 2:27:13.520]  That's heroic?
[2:27:13.520 --> 2:27:17.520]  What the hell are you talking about?
[2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:18.280]  I love you to death.
[2:27:18.280 --> 2:27:20.600]  I just want you to get your mind wrapped around the fact
[2:27:20.600 --> 2:27:24.600]  that this is hitting everybody, the GMO, the vaccines,
[2:27:24.600 --> 2:27:29.000]  the fluoride water, the damn electromagnetic assault
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:31.040]  we're under.
[2:27:31.040 --> 2:27:33.280]  And I just want to fight.
[2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:36.200]  I want to win.
[2:27:36.200 --> 2:27:39.400]  My cells do.
[2:27:39.400 --> 2:27:41.120]  My cells are mad at me.
[2:27:41.120 --> 2:27:44.120]  Literally, like, you're not fighting hard enough.
[2:27:44.120 --> 2:27:46.680]  That's why I don't like being complimented, because my cells
[2:27:46.680 --> 2:27:48.920]  are, you don't go home and get in a hot tub
[2:27:48.920 --> 2:27:50.160]  and have sex with your wife.
[2:27:50.160 --> 2:27:51.520]  You don't go out and enjoy dinner.
[2:27:51.520 --> 2:27:52.880]  You fight 18 hours a day.
[2:27:52.880 --> 2:27:55.880]  You piece of filth.
[2:27:55.880 --> 2:27:58.840]  That's what my soul and my cells are saying
[2:27:58.840 --> 2:28:01.440]  is you don't go enjoy yourself any.
[2:28:01.440 --> 2:28:02.320]  You attack.
[2:28:02.320 --> 2:28:03.680]  You attack these people.
[2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:05.320]  Now, get up now.
[2:28:05.320 --> 2:28:06.440]  God, what's your problem?
[2:28:06.440 --> 2:28:09.080]  It's like a drill sergeant screaming in my ear constantly.
[2:28:09.080 --> 2:28:10.280]  What the hell's your problem?
[2:28:10.280 --> 2:28:11.040]  What the hell?
[2:28:11.040 --> 2:28:12.280]  This is so damn obvious.
[2:28:12.280 --> 2:28:14.480]  You get up, and you mobilize people,
[2:28:14.480 --> 2:28:16.160]  and you take these globalist asses.
[2:28:16.160 --> 2:28:17.920]  Now, they will not stand in our way.
[2:28:21.200 --> 2:28:23.000]  So you're calling and telling me I'm doing a great job,
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:24.720]  and the drill sergeant is screaming at me
[2:28:24.720 --> 2:28:28.920]  to kill the globalist politically.
[2:28:28.920 --> 2:28:32.520]  And so that's why I have to go off air sometimes now,
[2:28:32.520 --> 2:28:33.600]  because I don't want to do that on air.
[2:28:33.600 --> 2:28:37.480]  I don't want to blow up like that.
[2:28:37.480 --> 2:28:40.640]  I just swear on the altar of God
[2:28:40.640 --> 2:28:45.760]  that we are going to destroy these people,
[2:28:45.760 --> 2:28:47.760]  and they need to be destroyed.
[2:28:47.760 --> 2:28:52.840]  These bullies, these baby killers, I can't wait.
[2:28:52.840 --> 2:28:54.640]  If you're trying to quit drinking
[2:28:54.640 --> 2:28:57.440]  or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[2:28:57.440 --> 2:28:59.480]  You don't know me, and we'll never meet.
[2:28:59.480 --> 2:29:01.200]  I had a problem like you once.
[2:29:01.200 --> 2:29:03.800]  I drank and used to party a little too much
[2:29:03.800 --> 2:29:07.720]  till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[2:29:07.720 --> 2:29:10.520]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem
[2:29:10.520 --> 2:29:12.800]  before it totally destroyed me.
[2:29:12.800 --> 2:29:15.680]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem,
[2:29:15.680 --> 2:29:17.960]  and you know you can't do it alone,
[2:29:17.960 --> 2:29:21.120]  you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[2:29:21.120 --> 2:29:23.680]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program
[2:29:23.680 --> 2:29:26.040]  to replace your old habits with new habits
[2:29:26.040 --> 2:29:28.040]  and totally change your life.
[2:29:28.040 --> 2:29:30.800]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance,
[2:29:30.800 --> 2:29:33.240]  the entire program may be covered.
[2:29:33.240 --> 2:29:36.560]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.

[2:30:57.120 --> 2:31:00.560]  but our best-selling vitamin D3 and vitamin K formula
[2:31:00.560 --> 2:31:03.680]  is back in stock, Winter Sun.
[2:31:03.680 --> 2:31:06.080]  In the fall, in the winter, as you know,
[2:31:06.080 --> 2:31:07.880]  your body, when you're not getting sunlight on the skin,
[2:31:07.880 --> 2:31:11.080]  does not produce vitamin D3.
[2:31:11.080 --> 2:31:13.240]  So it's important to ingest it,
[2:31:13.240 --> 2:31:16.320]  but a lot of people do not absorb it well in the gut.
[2:31:16.320 --> 2:31:18.960]  So you take this formula under the tongue,
[2:31:18.960 --> 2:31:20.760]  it tastes sweet naturally,
[2:31:20.760 --> 2:31:23.520]  let it sit there about 30 seconds to a minute,
[2:31:23.520 --> 2:31:27.360]  and then you swallow the rest, and it's just amazing.
[2:31:27.360 --> 2:31:29.520]  It's back in stock, and yes,
[2:31:29.520 --> 2:31:31.480]  we're gonna offer it a 50% off

[2:31:51.760 --> 2:31:54.000]  infowarsstore.com.
[2:31:54.000 --> 2:31:56.920]  As predicted, the human rebellion
[2:31:56.920 --> 2:32:01.120]  against globalist machines has begun.
[2:32:01.120 --> 2:32:03.680]  The LA Times, The Washington Post,
[2:32:03.680 --> 2:32:06.000]  Wired Magazine all reported years ago
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:11.000]  that major studies show 5G caused increased cancer in rats.
[2:32:11.120 --> 2:32:12.160]  It's a fact.
[2:32:12.160 --> 2:32:15.880]  5G is just a later generation of systems that are on record
[2:32:15.880 --> 2:32:18.880]  for more than 70 years to cause cancer.
[2:32:18.880 --> 2:32:21.800]  They rub the DNA molecules together.
[2:32:21.800 --> 2:32:24.320]  They are microwaves.
[2:32:24.320 --> 2:32:28.080]  Well now, YouTube has admitted to the BBC and others
[2:32:28.080 --> 2:32:31.000]  that they're banning anyone criticizing 5G,
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:33.400]  even if you don't connect it to coronavirus,
[2:32:33.400 --> 2:32:34.360]  they're banning it.
[2:32:34.360 --> 2:32:37.240]  But the studies do show that 5G lowers
[2:32:37.240 --> 2:32:39.240]  your immunity to viruses, period.
[2:32:39.240 --> 2:32:41.080]  They're peer reviewed journals.
[2:32:41.080 --> 2:32:43.280]  We're showing these documents on air
[2:32:43.280 --> 2:32:45.040]  and the globalists can go to hell.
[2:32:45.040 --> 2:32:48.280]  The human rebellion against globalist machines has begun.
[2:32:48.280 --> 2:32:50.520]  We're not troglodytes afraid of technology.
[2:32:50.520 --> 2:32:52.680]  We don't like technology with Trojan horse
[2:32:52.680 --> 2:32:54.120]  anti-human crap in it.
[2:32:54.120 --> 2:33:16.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:24.120 --> 2:33:49.120]  We've got Dr. Nick Baggage taking over next hour.
[2:33:49.120 --> 2:33:53.120]  And I looked at the news coming in.
[2:33:53.120 --> 2:33:56.120]  And every one of these stories certifies
[2:33:56.120 --> 2:33:59.680]  and confirms our worst nightmares.
[2:33:59.680 --> 2:34:04.240]  We're deep inside the new order now.
[2:34:04.240 --> 2:34:05.760]  But we're full grown adults.
[2:34:05.760 --> 2:34:08.160]  We're not some baby in the womb getting chopped up,
[2:34:08.160 --> 2:34:09.360]  getting our brains sucked out.
[2:34:09.360 --> 2:34:24.360]  Maybe I should just read these headlines.
[2:34:24.360 --> 2:34:28.040]  We have big breaking news out of Texas.
[2:34:28.040 --> 2:34:40.520]  And I've got the crew posting it on inforwars.com right now.
[2:34:40.520 --> 2:34:42.400]  Do you like being held hostage?
[2:34:42.400 --> 2:34:44.360]  That's the question I'm going to ask everybody,
[2:34:44.360 --> 2:34:49.080]  because that's what this is.
[2:34:49.080 --> 2:34:56.280]  And they've taken the weaponized common cold.
[2:34:56.280 --> 2:34:59.040]  And they added everybody else that dies in the common cold.
[2:34:59.040 --> 2:35:00.680]  Everybody else that dies in the flu.
[2:35:00.680 --> 2:35:02.720]  By the way, I looked it up.
[2:35:02.720 --> 2:35:06.240]  In the last five weeks, no one has
[2:35:06.240 --> 2:35:10.560]  been added to the CDC number of people that died from the flu.
[2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:13.640]  They normally just die of old age and just say the flu to it.
[2:35:13.640 --> 2:35:16.960]  They're all just boosting those numbers.
[2:35:16.960 --> 2:35:19.080]  Because they said, if you don't let us have martial law,
[2:35:19.080 --> 2:35:20.520]  it'll be up here.
[2:35:20.520 --> 2:35:21.880]  If you do let us have martial law,
[2:35:21.880 --> 2:35:23.000]  it'll be down about half.
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:25.200]  But instead, it's just this tiny little thing.
[2:35:25.200 --> 2:35:27.000]  So they're just putting every death they can there.
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:27.760]  Get it up, God.
[2:35:27.760 --> 2:35:30.280]  Scare up, good lord.
[2:35:30.280 --> 2:35:31.320]  But it's not working.
[2:35:34.040 --> 2:35:40.960]  But the companies are all making their employees do it.
[2:35:40.960 --> 2:35:41.960]  I'm not going to get into it.
[2:35:41.960 --> 2:35:46.640]  But they had an air conditioning guy here doing air condition
[2:35:46.640 --> 2:35:47.200]  repair today.
[2:35:47.200 --> 2:35:48.920]  I guess I am going to get into it.
[2:35:48.920 --> 2:35:52.720]  And he's on top the roof with a face mask on.
[2:35:52.720 --> 2:35:53.840]  And I asked him about it.
[2:35:53.840 --> 2:35:55.320]  And it's just the company called to do it.
[2:35:55.320 --> 2:35:55.960]  I get it.
[2:35:55.960 --> 2:35:58.120]  But see, it's like Halloween now.
[2:35:58.120 --> 2:35:59.040]  It's like year round.
[2:35:59.040 --> 2:36:01.400]  You just, everybody gets into it.
[2:36:01.400 --> 2:36:02.840]  And like I told you, I go to the park.
[2:36:02.840 --> 2:36:06.080]  I go to the, they've shut down most those around the world.
[2:36:06.080 --> 2:36:08.560]  I go to the, they're totally closing up in Austin.
[2:36:08.560 --> 2:36:09.720]  And I go to the park.
[2:36:09.720 --> 2:36:12.600]  And people will be like 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet away.
[2:36:12.600 --> 2:36:15.080]  They'll just still, oh, it's like a little fun.
[2:36:15.080 --> 2:36:17.440]  Like being scared is cool.
[2:36:17.440 --> 2:36:27.920]  Being hysterical is fun.
[2:36:27.920 --> 2:36:31.560]  I've got day of the dead level footage for you.
[2:36:31.560 --> 2:36:33.320]  I mean, I got it up one side and down the other.
[2:36:33.320 --> 2:36:35.440]  And I know you can all go see it.
[2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:38.480]  Hell, your damn Twitter feed's full of it.
[2:36:38.480 --> 2:36:42.040]  But just to watch humanity on its knees, begging,
[2:36:42.040 --> 2:36:44.560]  and being so scared of their own shadow,
[2:36:44.560 --> 2:36:56.520]  do you know that people that act like cowards get enslaved?
[2:36:56.520 --> 2:37:01.040]  If you go out in San Diego on a raft
[2:37:01.040 --> 2:37:04.680]  and you start cutting yourself and putting your hand
[2:37:04.680 --> 2:37:08.600]  in the water, there might be only 20 shock attacks a year
[2:37:08.600 --> 2:37:14.800]  off that coast, but you're about to be one of them.
[2:37:14.800 --> 2:37:17.000]  It's called blood in the water.
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:20.320]  And all this behavior, you like to be scared,
[2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:24.200]  you're going to be real scared.
[2:37:24.200 --> 2:37:27.360]  But see, you're going to get those vaccines,
[2:37:27.360 --> 2:37:29.240]  and then all of a sudden you're going to feel lumps all
[2:37:29.240 --> 2:37:30.960]  over your body.
[2:37:30.960 --> 2:37:32.560]  You're going to have lymphatic cancer.
[2:37:32.560 --> 2:37:35.800]  That's what they give you.
[2:37:35.800 --> 2:37:41.280]  And you're going to get blood cancer.
[2:37:41.280 --> 2:37:51.880]  And it's the loving doctor, and they're going to get you
[2:37:51.880 --> 2:37:52.640]  and take you in.
[2:37:52.640 --> 2:37:55.760]  And they're going to hit you with radiation and bug poison
[2:37:55.760 --> 2:37:57.760]  that costs them like $0.30 a package.
[2:37:57.760 --> 2:38:00.120]  They're going to charge you $1,000 per pill.
[2:38:00.120 --> 2:38:01.640]  And you're going to crap everything out.
[2:38:01.640 --> 2:38:03.520]  And they're going to turn your immune system off.
[2:38:03.520 --> 2:38:05.040]  And they're going to cut you up.
[2:38:05.040 --> 2:38:06.680]  You'll maybe live five years longer.
[2:38:06.680 --> 2:38:08.360]  And then they're going to die from the cancer
[2:38:08.360 --> 2:38:09.640]  that you get from the chemotherapy.
[2:38:12.240 --> 2:38:15.960]  But it'll be OK, though, because you'll be strong.
[2:38:15.960 --> 2:38:16.960]  And there'll be a run.
[2:38:16.960 --> 2:38:18.800]  You'll be there in your wheelchair.
[2:38:18.800 --> 2:38:22.480]  And then the runner's like, oh, we're raising money for you.
[2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:25.640]  But they're never going to find out why they're doing it to you.
[2:38:28.720 --> 2:38:29.640]  Oh, you're so brave.
[2:38:29.640 --> 2:38:30.840]  You've got breast cancer.
[2:38:30.840 --> 2:38:35.120]  I mean, a lot of brave women have fought it.
[2:38:35.120 --> 2:38:36.880]  We're going to suck about $100,000 out of you.
[2:38:40.480 --> 2:38:44.000]  Then I'm going to tell you that breast cancer didn't exist
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:46.560]  until toxins and glyphosates.
[2:38:46.560 --> 2:38:48.920]  I mean, it was like super rare.
[2:38:48.920 --> 2:38:51.120]  But now it's like, I've got a cancer.
[2:38:51.120 --> 2:38:52.480]  You've got a cancer.
[2:38:52.480 --> 2:38:59.720]  Wouldn't you like that cancer, too?
[2:38:59.720 --> 2:39:04.960]  And Bill Gates is a little satanic elf going, oh, oh.
[2:39:04.960 --> 2:39:07.400]  And Tim Cook's like, oh, oh.
[2:39:07.400 --> 2:39:10.600]  So they were in uniforms with iron crosses and tanks
[2:39:10.600 --> 2:39:11.040]  attacking.
[2:39:11.040 --> 2:39:12.040]  You'd fight them.
[2:39:12.040 --> 2:39:14.080]  But because they're like, oh, hi, I'm Bill Gates.
[2:39:14.080 --> 2:39:15.200]  Let's kill all people.
[2:39:15.200 --> 2:39:17.360]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, and let's take shots.
[2:39:17.360 --> 2:39:18.840]  Oh, I'm your boss now.
[2:39:18.840 --> 2:39:21.400]  Oh, you know, I've got a microchip for you.
[2:39:26.200 --> 2:39:29.160]  And here's what's sick about it.
[2:39:29.160 --> 2:39:33.720]  Metaphysically, when we act like this, we let Gates take over.
[2:39:33.720 --> 2:39:36.840]  And he then is the executor.
[2:39:36.840 --> 2:39:40.960]  See, he understands metaphysically because he gets off
[2:39:40.960 --> 2:39:44.280]  on it, that when you give him power over you
[2:39:44.280 --> 2:39:47.480]  and you let him play these games,
[2:39:47.480 --> 2:39:51.120]  he is then allowed to come in to judge you.
[2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:53.360]  Because when you don't stand up for the babies they're killing
[2:39:53.360 --> 2:39:55.560]  and you don't stand up for the kids they're pedophiling
[2:39:55.560 --> 2:39:57.560]  and you don't stand up against all the other things that
[2:39:57.560 --> 2:40:01.440]  you and the electromagnetic radiation, everything God goes,
[2:40:01.440 --> 2:40:05.680]  well, I'm not going to just let this happen to innocents
[2:40:05.680 --> 2:40:06.560]  and little kids.
[2:40:06.560 --> 2:40:09.080]  I'm going to let the devil kill all of you.
[2:40:09.080 --> 2:40:10.560]  And God's like, here's the Holy Spirit.
[2:40:10.560 --> 2:40:11.120]  Please stop.
[2:40:11.120 --> 2:40:12.440]  Transmitters, please stop.
[2:40:12.440 --> 2:40:13.200]  Please, I don't want to.
[2:40:13.200 --> 2:40:14.600]  OK, OK.
[2:40:14.600 --> 2:40:17.000]  All right, I'm not protecting anymore.
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:19.160]  Gate goes up.
[2:40:19.160 --> 2:40:22.960]  Globalist Rancor attacks.
[2:40:22.960 --> 2:40:25.640]  And it's like clockwork.
[2:40:25.640 --> 2:40:31.440]  And so I don't like Bill Gates, but the public going along
[2:40:31.440 --> 2:40:36.440]  with this, those of you that are,
[2:40:36.440 --> 2:40:40.840]  I'm not going to eat popcorn while you're dying of cancer.
[2:40:40.840 --> 2:40:43.040]  But I will eat popcorn when I'm dying of cancer,
[2:40:43.040 --> 2:40:45.000]  as I deserve.
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:48.600]  But see, that pain then will, because God balances accounts
[2:40:48.600 --> 2:40:48.800]  out.
[2:40:48.800 --> 2:40:50.360]  It's all mathematics.
[2:40:50.360 --> 2:40:52.920]  And so, oh, I've got a lot more pain to atone for what I've done.
[2:40:52.920 --> 2:40:54.360]  So I'm not a masochist either.
[2:40:54.360 --> 2:40:56.920]  I don't like pain, but I really like pain,
[2:40:56.920 --> 2:40:59.120]  because I need to pay.
[2:40:59.120 --> 2:41:01.560]  And all of you that try to escape pain,
[2:41:01.560 --> 2:41:03.520]  you're going to pay way worse.
[2:41:03.520 --> 2:41:05.920]  So let me just tell Bill Gates and all of them something.
[2:41:05.920 --> 2:41:08.800]  Let me prophesy this, because God said it.
[2:41:08.800 --> 2:41:11.000]  Nothing you've built will stay in place.
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:12.440]  It'll all be overturned.
[2:41:12.440 --> 2:41:16.360]  And Bill Gates will die an agonizing, slow death
[2:41:16.360 --> 2:41:20.200]  of his own doing when he gets heart transplants and brain
[2:41:20.200 --> 2:41:20.840]  fusions.
[2:41:20.840 --> 2:41:22.560]  And he won't even be himself.
[2:41:22.560 --> 2:41:25.240]  He'll be dead long before his body's gone.
[2:41:25.240 --> 2:41:33.080]  Bill Gates is a walking toilet.
[2:41:33.080 --> 2:41:37.640]  The demons take craps in.
[2:41:37.640 --> 2:41:41.000]  And so we don't take pleasure in his destruction.
[2:41:45.480 --> 2:41:47.400]  I mean, I'd say it's like stepping on a cockroach.
[2:41:47.400 --> 2:41:53.200]  But cockroaches serve a purpose.
[2:41:53.200 --> 2:41:56.800]  So I consider all day and talk.
[2:41:56.800 --> 2:41:58.880]  I don't know what to say anymore.
[2:41:58.880 --> 2:42:02.600]  Listen, all of you that like death and like killing babies
[2:42:02.600 --> 2:42:04.440]  and think it's all cute, you're going
[2:42:04.440 --> 2:42:10.760]  to get a front row seat to your own brain surgery.
[2:42:10.760 --> 2:42:12.720]  And the people that are going to be conducting it
[2:42:12.720 --> 2:42:14.800]  are not very nice.
[2:42:14.800 --> 2:42:19.640]  So I'm just here saying, talk to signposts
[2:42:19.640 --> 2:42:22.120]  like this way, death, this way, life.
[2:42:22.120 --> 2:42:24.600]  And I'm just sitting there watching people go down this path.
[2:42:24.600 --> 2:42:27.080]  I'm like, OK, because I've been down that path.
[2:42:27.080 --> 2:42:29.520]  I've seen where that goes.
[2:42:29.520 --> 2:42:33.960]  And it's so horrible that I cannot believe
[2:42:33.960 --> 2:42:35.520]  that people think it's OK.
[2:42:35.520 --> 2:42:38.280]  Or other people think it's heroic not
[2:42:38.280 --> 2:42:41.440]  to want to go down the road.
[2:42:41.440 --> 2:42:43.320]  Oh, it's not heroic.
[2:42:43.320 --> 2:42:47.600]  It's called having a soul.
[2:42:47.600 --> 2:42:48.960]  Hell awaits, my friends.
[2:42:48.960 --> 2:42:49.920]  Hell awaits.
[2:42:54.400 --> 2:42:58.680]  Do yourself a favor and find the info war at the same time.
[2:42:58.680 --> 2:43:02.160]  Go to infowarstore.com and read about the ingredients
[2:43:02.160 --> 2:43:04.640]  of the highest quality, like black walnut and others,
[2:43:04.640 --> 2:43:05.600]  that are in this baby.
[2:43:05.600 --> 2:43:07.680]  And then read some of those reviews for yourself.
[2:43:07.680 --> 2:43:09.200]  And then don't just believe in for worse.
[2:43:09.200 --> 2:43:12.120]  Go out online at major nutrition sites and others
[2:43:12.120 --> 2:43:14.360]  and look at the studies for yourself.
[2:43:14.360 --> 2:43:17.560]  Go out and engage in your First Amendment right to research
[2:43:17.560 --> 2:43:19.800]  and your First Amendment right to tell others
[2:43:19.800 --> 2:43:22.400]  about the incredible compounds God has given us
[2:43:22.400 --> 2:43:23.200]  through Mother Nature.

[2:43:55.720 --> 2:43:57.040]  and tell me I've done a good job.
[2:43:57.040 --> 2:43:59.640]  I've done nothing but my duty.
[2:43:59.640 --> 2:44:02.600]  I discovered a bunch of bloodthirsty scum coming
[2:44:02.600 --> 2:44:04.120]  after innocent people.
[2:44:04.120 --> 2:44:07.000]  And I've been psyched up for 13 years.
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:10.400]  And I'll never stop while I'm growing breath.
[2:44:10.400 --> 2:44:14.240]  For 26 years, Alex Jones and Info Wars
[2:44:14.240 --> 2:44:18.440]  have been sounding the alarm for patriots worldwide,
[2:44:18.440 --> 2:44:22.040]  waking people up to the new world order.
[2:44:22.040 --> 2:44:26.520]  Bohemian Grove, the American deep state,
[2:44:26.520 --> 2:44:32.400]  the rise of communist China, the plan for global depopulation,
[2:44:32.400 --> 2:44:37.400]  and global elite pedophiles who prey off of our young.
[2:44:37.400 --> 2:44:40.040]  The enemy has done their best to destroy us.
[2:44:40.040 --> 2:44:43.800]  But because of your support, our fight continues.
[2:44:43.800 --> 2:44:44.880]  Join us.
[2:44:44.880 --> 2:44:46.680]  Support the Info War.
[2:44:46.680 --> 2:44:49.520]  And together, we will slay the dragon.
[2:44:49.520 --> 2:44:50.520]  Keep fighting, Alex.
[2:44:50.520 --> 2:44:51.280]  You're the gladiator.
[2:44:51.280 --> 2:44:53.960]  I'm the gladiator.
[2:44:53.960 --> 2:44:56.240]  Since the invention and deployment of radar
[2:44:56.240 --> 2:45:00.000]  during World War II, scientists have noted increased cancers
[2:45:00.000 --> 2:45:03.080]  and other health problems with those who were close
[2:45:03.080 --> 2:45:04.360]  to the devices.
[2:45:04.360 --> 2:45:06.720]  That's where they're really high powered.
[2:45:06.720 --> 2:45:09.160]  If you're a quarter mile from a cell tower,
[2:45:09.160 --> 2:45:12.200]  there's not any real high powered radiation hitting you.
[2:45:12.200 --> 2:45:14.160]  But if you're a couple hundred feet away,
[2:45:14.160 --> 2:45:16.400]  they got fences around them with skull and crossbones
[2:45:16.400 --> 2:45:17.440]  on them for a reason.
[2:45:17.440 --> 2:45:19.320]  It says it can hurt you.
[2:45:19.320 --> 2:45:22.320]  So now with 5G that's even stronger,
[2:45:22.320 --> 2:45:26.360]  these systems are literally above the streets, just 20 or 30
[2:45:26.360 --> 2:45:29.360]  feet from people's heads, from their genitals,
[2:45:29.360 --> 2:45:30.520]  from their bodies.
[2:45:30.520 --> 2:45:32.720]  People are burning them down and attacking them
[2:45:32.720 --> 2:45:34.080]  all over the world now.
[2:45:34.080 --> 2:45:36.000]  I'm saying, don't do that.
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:37.680]  Use information warfare.
[2:45:37.680 --> 2:45:41.240]  Use the truth to expose it and sue local governments
[2:45:41.240 --> 2:45:43.200]  and others until they remove them.
[2:45:43.200 --> 2:45:47.040]  That's the way to deal with this, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:45:47.040 --> 2:45:49.840]  Take action in the information war.
[2:45:49.840 --> 2:45:51.800]  But I got to tell you, I can't blame the people that
[2:45:51.800 --> 2:45:53.960]  are doing it because they're under assault.
[2:45:53.960 --> 2:45:56.960]  I don't need to remind you how four years ago I told you
[2:45:56.960 --> 2:45:58.880]  the polls against Trump were fake.
[2:45:58.880 --> 2:46:02.360]  He was winning by a giant margin, but election fraud almost
[2:46:02.360 --> 2:46:05.200]  stole the election from Trump and the American people.
[2:46:05.200 --> 2:46:07.280]  Well, now they're pushing the idea
[2:46:07.280 --> 2:46:11.040]  that, oh, cancel the Republican and Democrat
[2:46:11.040 --> 2:46:13.960]  conventions, maybe cancel the election a year.
[2:46:13.960 --> 2:46:16.280]  Like the Olympics, that's because they
[2:46:16.280 --> 2:46:19.160]  know Trump in every internal scientific poll
[2:46:19.160 --> 2:46:23.160]  is 20 points ahead of the brain damage by.
[2:46:23.160 --> 2:46:25.680]  So they can say, sir, you look big like the Olympics.
[2:46:25.680 --> 2:46:27.520]  Go ahead and back it off a year.
[2:46:27.520 --> 2:46:29.160]  And then you'll still win in a year
[2:46:29.160 --> 2:46:30.080]  after you fix the crisis.
[2:46:30.080 --> 2:46:30.880]  No.
[2:46:30.880 --> 2:46:33.600]  They need more time to cook up an assassination
[2:46:33.600 --> 2:46:35.720]  and economic collapse and new virus.
[2:46:35.720 --> 2:46:37.280]  Trump needs to say, no, in America,
[2:46:37.280 --> 2:46:40.000]  we keep elections on time, have the elections,
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:43.800]  win by a landslide, and not give the globalists what they want.
[2:46:43.800 --> 2:46:47.280]  Hillary, Biden, they all want to suspend the election.
[2:46:47.280 --> 2:46:49.120]  We shouldn't give them what they want.
[2:46:49.120 --> 2:46:52.840]  We need to have a vote in America and reelect Trump 2020.
[2:46:52.840 --> 2:47:08.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:08.760 --> 2:47:11.560]  You keep saying you've got something for me.
[2:47:11.560 --> 2:47:16.920]  From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:16.920 --> 2:47:22.800]  You keep saying you've got something for me.
[2:47:22.800 --> 2:47:25.040]  Something you call love.
[2:47:25.040 --> 2:47:28.520]  But confess.
[2:47:28.520 --> 2:47:33.960]  You've been a messin' where you shouldn't have been a messin'.
[2:47:33.960 --> 2:47:38.240]  And now someone else is gettin' all your best.
[2:47:38.240 --> 2:47:42.920]  Mad scientist, because we don't block them
[2:47:42.920 --> 2:47:45.600]  from doing all the cloning and genetic engineering.
[2:47:45.600 --> 2:47:48.000]  They go and they do it.
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:51.000]  And then they try to take over because we
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:53.120]  didn't stand their way.
[2:47:53.120 --> 2:47:54.360]  Shouldn't have been doin' it.
[2:47:54.360 --> 2:47:58.040]  Shouldn't have been messin' where they were messin'.
[2:47:58.040 --> 2:48:00.960]  OK, well, one of our crew members
[2:48:00.960 --> 2:48:05.920]  has a fellow we work with that's out at Fort Hood.
[2:48:05.920 --> 2:48:07.680]  And he gave us a call about an hour ago.
[2:48:07.680 --> 2:48:11.560]  And he said, yeah, they're on the news saying,
[2:48:11.560 --> 2:48:14.360]  do not leave the county.
[2:48:14.360 --> 2:48:16.640]  And do not come into the county.
[2:48:16.640 --> 2:48:18.960]  And I said, well, call on the show and talk about it.
[2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:22.240]  I said, well, just here's the news articles.
[2:48:22.240 --> 2:48:25.920]  It's actually a TV news piece that we'll have for you
[2:48:25.920 --> 2:48:28.040]  coming up when Owen Troyer does the war room.
[2:48:28.040 --> 2:48:29.000]  But here it is.
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:31.480]  Let's get that video.
[2:48:31.480 --> 2:48:35.840]  Another central Texas county issues stay at home order.
[2:48:35.840 --> 2:48:39.640]  And in it, it says it also bars non-residents
[2:48:39.640 --> 2:48:42.320]  from entering the county, except for those people working
[2:48:42.320 --> 2:48:45.400]  in the county under the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
[2:48:45.400 --> 2:48:48.480]  Security Agency's list of essential critical infrastructure
[2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:50.920]  services and those individuals seeking
[2:48:50.920 --> 2:48:54.920]  emergency medical treatment.
[2:48:54.920 --> 2:48:57.960]  Now, that's martial law.
[2:48:57.960 --> 2:48:59.960]  But the media takes it one step further
[2:48:59.960 --> 2:49:03.440]  and is telling everybody, just don't go out, period.
[2:49:03.440 --> 2:49:05.360]  And California is set to announce,
[2:49:05.360 --> 2:49:09.160]  as soon as Trump tries to open the economy up,
[2:49:09.160 --> 2:49:12.520]  they're going to announce don't even leave your house for groceries
[2:49:12.520 --> 2:49:16.200]  to create total hysteria and to create civil unrest.
[2:49:16.200 --> 2:49:20.840]  And civil unrest will tank the stock market so bad.
[2:49:20.840 --> 2:49:22.920]  And that's the plan.
[2:49:22.920 --> 2:49:26.280]  So Texas counties declare martial law,
[2:49:26.280 --> 2:49:28.720]  take the leftist bait to kill the economy.
[2:49:28.720 --> 2:49:32.080]  That's the headline that's going up on inforwars.com right now.
[2:49:34.920 --> 2:49:44.400]  Now, I've got hundreds of incredible stories,
[2:49:44.400 --> 2:49:47.920]  dozens of amazing videos.
[2:49:47.920 --> 2:49:50.560]  But you know, I'm not just here to entertain people.
[2:49:50.560 --> 2:49:51.600]  I know you're not here for that.
[2:49:57.240 --> 2:50:00.200]  It's almost sick to air clips of America
[2:50:00.200 --> 2:50:02.480]  and all our hard fought freedoms being slowly torn limb
[2:50:02.480 --> 2:50:04.960]  from limb.
[2:50:04.960 --> 2:50:07.440]  It's gratuitous at a certain point.
[2:50:07.440 --> 2:50:11.080]  So let me just state the basic facts.
[2:50:11.080 --> 2:50:16.800]  All over the United States, they're playing with the clips now,
[2:50:16.800 --> 2:50:26.840]  they are dragging people savagely
[2:50:26.840 --> 2:50:30.640]  in Philadelphia and other areas off of buses
[2:50:30.640 --> 2:50:35.720]  and physically attacking them in a virtue signal
[2:50:35.720 --> 2:50:41.800]  to show how they are fighting tyranny of the virus.
[2:50:41.800 --> 2:50:43.960]  Yeah, let's just play this from the beginning.
[2:50:43.960 --> 2:50:45.920]  Philadelphia man dragged off bus with police
[2:50:45.920 --> 2:50:50.080]  for not wearing face mask.
[2:50:50.080 --> 2:50:52.120]  Meanwhile, the cop can't breathe through his face mask
[2:50:52.120 --> 2:50:55.520]  so they've all got their noses out.
[2:50:55.520 --> 2:50:56.680]  It's all virtue signal.
[2:51:00.680 --> 2:51:05.000]  Because they told everybody, you're a hero if you wear a mask.
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:08.280]  Well, yeah, start it over.
[2:51:08.280 --> 2:51:10.320]  Show the video.
[2:51:10.320 --> 2:51:10.800]  Philadelphia.
[2:51:16.240 --> 2:51:17.560]  They all call the police on him.
[2:51:28.360 --> 2:51:32.320]  As if that protects anybody.
[2:51:32.320 --> 2:51:35.200]  And again, this has got custody, so we'll delete that out.
[2:51:35.200 --> 2:51:41.400]  The point is that they always knew the virus wasn't
[2:51:41.400 --> 2:51:43.480]  going to kill that many people.
[2:51:43.480 --> 2:51:46.520]  But they knew to make it man made
[2:51:46.520 --> 2:51:49.240]  to make the US government freak out and actually be scared of it.
[2:51:54.360 --> 2:51:59.040]  And then when it doesn't kill a bunch of people,
[2:51:59.040 --> 2:52:01.360]  they say, oh, the lockdown did that.
[2:52:01.360 --> 2:52:03.120]  But it's so way below.
[2:52:03.120 --> 2:52:05.560]  Like they said, well, this is the graph.
[2:52:05.560 --> 2:52:07.840]  Millions dead, two plus million dead,
[2:52:07.840 --> 2:52:10.440]  but only 200,000 died.
[2:52:10.440 --> 2:52:12.320]  I do what we said, but it's actually way down here.
[2:52:16.600 --> 2:52:18.880]  Let's put up the maps here of what the UN,
[2:52:18.880 --> 2:52:19.800]  because they're our boss.
[2:52:19.800 --> 2:52:20.960]  They tell us what's new.
[2:52:20.960 --> 2:52:25.800]  Let's put the UN graph of how many have died in America.
[2:52:25.800 --> 2:52:32.880]  Total deaths worldwide, 100,376.
[2:52:32.880 --> 2:52:35.920]  And I felt really guilty last night.
[2:52:35.920 --> 2:52:38.360]  I got home from work about 8 o'clock.
[2:52:38.360 --> 2:52:41.920]  And I went, oh, I didn't tell Marcos Morales that
[2:52:41.920 --> 2:52:44.080]  was editing the live show down in pieces,
[2:52:44.080 --> 2:52:46.080]  the names of the videos.
[2:52:46.080 --> 2:52:47.360]  And I went and looked at the names.
[2:52:47.360 --> 2:52:48.400]  He had some good names.
[2:52:48.400 --> 2:52:52.280]  But I felt guilty because it was really a powerful piece.
[2:52:52.280 --> 2:52:54.040]  We'd have to start in the same way.
[2:52:54.040 --> 2:52:57.120]  It's a powerful piece we'd have to start in the second hour.
[2:52:57.120 --> 2:52:59.600]  Where I showed AP Reuters all of them saying,
[2:52:59.600 --> 2:53:03.200]  2 billion people are becoming poor.
[2:53:03.200 --> 2:53:06.360]  Half a billion are becoming destitute.
[2:53:06.360 --> 2:53:08.040]  And they estimate 2 million of those
[2:53:08.040 --> 2:53:12.160]  will starve to death by the end of 2020.
[2:53:12.160 --> 2:53:16.200]  That was the Associated Press saying,
[2:53:16.200 --> 2:53:17.480]  see, there's not the drama.
[2:53:17.480 --> 2:53:19.400]  The media didn't say there was 2 million.
[2:53:19.400 --> 2:53:20.640]  They're going to starve to death.
[2:53:20.640 --> 2:53:27.400]  Little babies and mothers and fathers and old people.
[2:53:27.400 --> 2:53:29.720]  There's nothing sexy about a master
[2:53:29.720 --> 2:53:33.640]  sashaying around all scaring, like, oh, oh, oh.
[2:53:33.640 --> 2:53:36.760]  In our first world decadence, like 2 million,
[2:53:36.760 --> 2:53:40.920]  we're kind of like, yeah, just kill those brown people.
[2:53:40.920 --> 2:53:43.760]  Too many up anyways.
[2:53:43.760 --> 2:53:48.840]  2 million, the UN say, are going to starve to death this year.
[2:53:48.840 --> 2:53:56.720]  Extra, it's 189 million since 1990 and their own numbers.
[2:53:56.720 --> 2:53:58.040]  Yeah, just an extra two.
[2:53:58.040 --> 2:54:01.480]  But see, those 2 million dead need
[2:54:01.480 --> 2:54:02.680]  to die to save the Earth.
[2:54:02.680 --> 2:54:05.520]  And Fauci is not going to personalize them.
[2:54:05.520 --> 2:54:08.200]  He's not going to talk about how the economy is shutting down
[2:54:08.200 --> 2:54:09.640]  here.
[2:54:09.640 --> 2:54:11.160]  You just deplete your bank account
[2:54:11.160 --> 2:54:14.320]  and got to borrow money from your parents.
[2:54:14.320 --> 2:54:17.160]  But for somebody in Africa or poor areas of Latin America
[2:54:17.160 --> 2:54:20.480]  or Asia, you don't get any food.
[2:54:20.480 --> 2:54:22.640]  You shrivel up, you die, and they just
[2:54:22.640 --> 2:54:25.440]  throw your ass in a crematorium.
[2:54:25.440 --> 2:54:31.120]  But see, it doesn't matter because it's liberal.
[2:54:31.120 --> 2:54:34.760]  Just like men in Dracula outfits and the children
[2:54:34.760 --> 2:54:38.720]  come in crying and Fox News in Houston
[2:54:38.720 --> 2:54:41.200]  goes, got to get them while they're young
[2:54:41.200 --> 2:54:46.800]  and they laugh as kids crying are put on the laps of pedophiles
[2:54:46.800 --> 2:54:51.360]  because those talk show hosts know when they do that,
[2:54:51.360 --> 2:54:52.240]  they keep their job.
[2:54:52.240 --> 2:54:55.600]  And their boss comes in and says, good job, Bob.
[2:54:55.600 --> 2:54:57.200]  Good job, Bill.
[2:54:57.200 --> 2:55:00.000]  Good job, Karen.
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:01.600]  You're really toe on the line.
[2:55:01.600 --> 2:55:03.800]  You're a team player.
[2:55:03.800 --> 2:55:06.400]  You let a fat convicted pedophile
[2:55:06.400 --> 2:55:09.800]  take a little girl crying with her sick pedophile,
[2:55:09.800 --> 2:55:13.560]  worshiping mother and a little girl.
[2:55:13.560 --> 2:55:17.480]  The big fat guy, they even ride horsey in the videos
[2:55:17.480 --> 2:55:20.600]  I've shown you, and men with huge ding dongs
[2:55:20.600 --> 2:55:24.880]  with glitter all over them, you know, just like little kids
[2:55:24.880 --> 2:55:27.800]  like, they can grab the guy and say, oh, come to me.
[2:55:27.800 --> 2:55:30.360]  This is just nothing you won't put up with.
[2:55:30.360 --> 2:55:31.840]  There's nothing you won't do while they
[2:55:31.840 --> 2:55:33.160]  shark out on your kids.
[2:55:35.840 --> 2:55:38.000]  And it's because the dam collapsed.
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:41.240]  That's why the feds are like, these criminals
[2:55:41.240 --> 2:55:44.080]  that interface with the program, they go, you know, Jones,
[2:55:44.080 --> 2:55:46.920]  well, one day we'll get you in prison.
[2:55:46.920 --> 2:55:48.520]  We're going to have you killed in there.
[2:55:48.520 --> 2:55:51.920]  So you're going to get raped in prison, Jones.
[2:55:51.920 --> 2:55:53.720]  You think you're so tough.
[2:55:53.720 --> 2:55:57.560]  I mean, you think if I'm in prison and somebody's
[2:55:57.560 --> 2:56:03.640]  raping me that you've beaten me, you think that scares me.
[2:56:03.640 --> 2:56:05.720]  I'm scared of being raped.
[2:56:05.720 --> 2:56:08.600]  You think that scares me.
[2:56:08.600 --> 2:56:10.760]  Because I've seen where you're going.
[2:56:10.760 --> 2:56:12.280]  I don't want to be with you for eternity.
[2:56:12.280 --> 2:56:16.320]  Believe me, rape away, man.
[2:56:16.320 --> 2:56:19.000]  They'll be real quick and real easy.
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:22.160]  Because I've been in extreme pain.
[2:56:22.160 --> 2:56:25.200]  And it's easy to deal with.
[2:56:25.200 --> 2:56:29.880]  If it's the ticket to get away from you, then double down,
[2:56:29.880 --> 2:56:30.800]  baby.
[2:56:30.800 --> 2:56:32.200]  You don't scare me.
[2:56:32.200 --> 2:56:34.320]  I'm scared of God.
[2:56:34.320 --> 2:56:40.520]  And the fact that you lick your lips at salon and at HBO
[2:56:40.520 --> 2:56:49.360]  and promote pedophilia, and that then you think I'm like you,
[2:56:49.360 --> 2:56:55.960]  you think I'm scared of you, my instinct
[2:56:55.960 --> 2:56:57.880]  is to do really bad things to the globalist.
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:57:04.400]  But God has sent the Comforter in spite, son, don't you worry.
[2:57:04.400 --> 2:57:08.320]  You can't imagine what these people are going to be put
[2:57:08.320 --> 2:57:11.720]  through because they chose it.
[2:57:11.720 --> 2:57:13.680]  God doesn't torture these people.
[2:57:13.680 --> 2:57:15.120]  God removes his protection.
[2:57:17.760 --> 2:57:20.960]  But there's really no pleasure in knowing the eternities
[2:57:20.960 --> 2:57:23.560]  of agonizing torture they're going to go through.
[2:57:23.560 --> 2:57:25.600]  Because that doesn't protect the innocence.
[2:57:25.600 --> 2:57:27.960]  And so that's why we've got to do this now.
[2:57:27.960 --> 2:57:32.080]  Dr. Nick Baggs is set to take over.
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:36.520]  I don't tend to plug the products when we're under attack.
[2:57:36.520 --> 2:57:39.160]  But that's how we stay in the fight.
[2:57:39.160 --> 2:57:41.040]  Get products you need.
[2:57:41.040 --> 2:57:42.680]  Energize the war.
[2:57:42.680 --> 2:57:44.920]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough
[2:57:44.920 --> 2:57:48.080]  in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[2:57:48.080 --> 2:57:51.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way
[2:57:51.000 --> 2:57:54.600]  to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting
[2:57:54.600 --> 2:57:57.160]  clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[2:57:57.160 --> 2:58:00.160]  eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[2:58:00.160 --> 2:58:02.920]  In the 1960s, researchers in France
[2:58:02.920 --> 2:58:05.440]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[2:58:05.440 --> 2:58:09.360]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[2:58:09.360 --> 2:58:12.200]  They began studying this effect in published trials.
[2:58:12.200 --> 2:58:14.400]  And decades later, we now have the fruit
[2:58:14.400 --> 2:58:17.760]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that
[2:58:17.760 --> 2:58:20.360]  helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[2:58:20.360 --> 2:58:23.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[2:58:23.000 --> 2:58:24.760]  It is not an antihistamine.
[2:58:24.760 --> 2:58:26.400]  In fact, current research has found
[2:58:26.400 --> 2:58:29.800]  that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[2:58:29.800 --> 2:58:32.960]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[2:58:32.960 --> 2:58:34.760]  responses in the body.
[2:58:34.760 --> 2:58:37.400]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[2:58:37.400 --> 2:58:39.760]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab
[2:58:39.760 --> 2:58:43.840]  a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[2:58:43.840 --> 2:58:46.160]  It's incontrovertible.
[2:58:46.160 --> 2:58:48.560]  Humanity is dying.
[2:58:48.560 --> 2:58:50.960]  Every metric, every gauge we have
[2:58:50.960 --> 2:58:57.480]  shows that we're living shorter lives, we are diseased,
[2:58:57.480 --> 2:59:01.120]  our IQs are plunging, and we're ugly.
[2:59:01.120 --> 2:59:02.880]  We're falling apart.
[2:59:02.880 --> 2:59:07.440]  Big pharma and the entire lovelast operation is a kill grid.
[2:59:07.440 --> 2:59:08.560]  And the studies are clear.
[2:59:08.560 --> 2:59:11.080]  The average person is in a dream-like state,
[2:59:11.080 --> 2:59:15.200]  a near-dream-like daydream world,
[2:59:15.200 --> 2:59:17.360]  programmed at the flicker rates of the televisions
[2:59:17.360 --> 2:59:19.000]  and all the screens.
[2:59:19.000 --> 2:59:22.960]  We are in a trance, and now they're
[2:59:22.960 --> 2:59:26.320]  turning up the power of the ambient electromagnetic
[2:59:26.320 --> 2:59:29.880]  radiation, which, again, all the studies conclusively show,
[2:59:29.880 --> 2:59:33.920]  cause massive cancer and destroy your immune system
[2:59:33.920 --> 2:59:37.200]  and push viruses across the cell membrane.
[2:59:37.200 --> 2:59:38.440]  We are being murdered.
[2:59:38.440 --> 2:59:41.600]  And I've got to tell you, it's very sophisticated
[2:59:41.600 --> 2:59:42.600]  and looks not human.
[2:59:42.600 --> 2:59:46.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:59:50.600 --> 2:59:55.600]  When the levee breaks, his head's about to lift.
[2:59:55.600 --> 2:59:57.600]  It'll have no place to stay.
[2:59:57.600 --> 3:00:02.600]  And the hedge is going down.
[3:00:02.600 --> 3:00:04.600]  It's going down.
[3:00:04.600 --> 3:00:07.600]  It's going down now.
[3:00:07.600 --> 3:00:13.600]  It's going down, it's going down, it's going down now.
[3:00:13.600 --> 3:00:17.600]  It's going down in Chicago.
[3:00:17.600 --> 3:00:20.600]  It's going to go down in Dallas.
[3:00:20.600 --> 3:00:25.600]  It's going to go down in New York, in Miami, in Los Angeles,
[3:00:25.600 --> 3:00:30.600]  in Albuquerque, in Seattle, in Omaha.
[3:00:30.600 --> 3:00:35.600]  It's going down, it's going down, it's going down.
[3:00:35.600 --> 3:00:38.600]  Just like those of us who already jacked in and saw it,
[3:00:38.600 --> 3:00:44.600]  going down, going down, going down, going down,
[3:00:44.600 --> 3:00:50.600]  going down now, going down, going down, going down,
[3:00:50.600 --> 3:00:57.600]  going down, going down, going down, until we reach up to God
[3:00:57.600 --> 3:01:01.600]  and say, we know, we're sorry, we want to be good,
[3:01:01.600 --> 3:01:03.600]  we're not cowards anymore.
[3:01:03.600 --> 3:01:06.600]  And then it starts going back up.
[3:01:06.600 --> 3:01:13.600]  And then the battles happen and all the epic moments,
[3:01:13.600 --> 3:01:18.600]  because the decadence is over now, the fight is here.
[3:01:18.600 --> 3:01:21.600]  If it keeps on raining, love is going to break.
[3:01:21.600 --> 3:01:23.600]  Listen to this.
[3:01:23.600 --> 3:01:26.600]  It keeps on raining.
[3:01:26.600 --> 3:01:27.600]  Keep killing babies, man.
[3:01:27.600 --> 3:01:29.600]  God's love's going to break.
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:34.600]  The levee's going to break.
[3:01:34.600 --> 3:01:35.600]  That's right.
[3:01:35.600 --> 3:01:39.600]  When the levee breaks, all the games are over.
[3:01:39.600 --> 3:01:41.600]  Now it's time to kill.
[3:01:41.600 --> 3:01:43.600]  I'm not scared of that.
[3:01:43.600 --> 3:01:45.600]  God, get high as a kite.
[3:01:45.600 --> 3:01:47.600]  So easy.
[3:01:47.600 --> 3:01:49.600]  Killing people is easier than putting your boots on.
[3:01:49.600 --> 3:01:51.600]  Let me tell you.
[3:01:51.600 --> 3:01:54.600]  What's hard is building a family and growing crops
[3:01:54.600 --> 3:01:58.600]  and working hard, being strong, being a good person.
[3:01:58.600 --> 3:01:59.600]  But you know what?
[3:01:59.600 --> 3:02:00.600]  That's what fulfills you.
[3:02:00.600 --> 3:02:03.600]  Killing that in a pavilion.
[3:02:03.600 --> 3:02:06.600]  It might be a pavilion for five minutes,
[3:02:06.600 --> 3:02:08.600]  but it's not going to fulfill your soul.
[3:02:08.600 --> 3:02:19.600]  Like that big, cool drink of water, even in the Sahara desert.
[3:02:19.600 --> 3:02:22.600]  Running the course.
[3:02:22.600 --> 3:02:27.600]  Defeating the evil.
[3:02:27.600 --> 3:02:30.600]  That's going to fulfill us.
[3:02:30.600 --> 3:02:33.600]  Dr. Nick Becker, this is about to take over.
[3:02:33.600 --> 3:02:35.600]  I can tell you this, though.
[3:02:35.600 --> 3:02:38.600]  All I want to do is stay in this fight.
[3:02:38.600 --> 3:02:42.600]  And I see so many good men and women of every race, color and creator
[3:02:42.600 --> 3:02:45.600]  who bleed red blood or humans who've been attacked by this
[3:02:45.600 --> 3:02:48.600]  and who've been made to where you don't realize your destiny
[3:02:48.600 --> 3:02:50.600]  and the spark of humanity you have
[3:02:50.600 --> 3:02:53.600]  and what it is you can do and your potential.
[3:02:53.600 --> 3:02:56.600]  Donnie was right that each of us is a seed of the universe,
[3:02:56.600 --> 3:02:58.600]  but you have to plant that seed.
[3:02:58.600 --> 3:03:00.600]  You have to water that seed.
[3:03:00.600 --> 3:03:02.600]  You have to commit to that.
[3:03:02.600 --> 3:03:07.600]  And you have to not care what slaves of the system say to you
[3:03:07.600 --> 3:03:11.600]  when they try to intimidate you and try to laugh at you
[3:03:11.600 --> 3:03:13.600]  and try to make you feel like you're failing.
[3:03:13.600 --> 3:03:21.600]  That is the corrupt system dying.
[3:03:21.600 --> 3:03:25.600]  Those attempts to oppress you and control you and lie to you
[3:03:25.600 --> 3:03:28.600]  is the system failing.
[3:03:28.600 --> 3:03:30.600]  It knows we love each other.
[3:03:30.600 --> 3:03:32.600]  It knows we're coming together.
[3:03:32.600 --> 3:03:35.600]  It knows we have a fabulous world
[3:03:35.600 --> 3:03:37.600]  and things we can do that are so amazing.
[3:03:37.600 --> 3:03:40.600]  We've just begun to discover our power.
[3:03:40.600 --> 3:03:42.600]  And it doesn't want you to have that.
[3:03:42.600 --> 3:03:45.600]  It wants to steal that and capture your soul
[3:03:45.600 --> 3:03:49.600]  and use it because it's not creative.
[3:03:49.600 --> 3:03:53.600]  The spirit of the New World Order is not creative.
[3:03:53.600 --> 3:03:57.600]  It needs to capture you and make you beg it and plead
[3:03:57.600 --> 3:04:00.600]  so that you can even be on its platform and show your creativity.
[3:04:00.600 --> 3:04:04.600]  And then it sits in judgment like a satanic American idol
[3:04:04.600 --> 3:04:07.600]  and tells you how good you are because you've served
[3:04:07.600 --> 3:04:10.600]  and you bow to it when it couldn't produce
[3:04:10.600 --> 3:04:15.600]  one original thought in the universe.
[3:04:15.600 --> 3:04:21.600]  Innovation and courage and the exercise of will
[3:04:21.600 --> 3:04:26.600]  and learning to be attacked and learning to not submit to that
[3:04:26.600 --> 3:04:30.600]  is what makes us grow.
[3:04:30.600 --> 3:04:33.600]  Dr. Nick Baggetts, your real trailblazer is about to take over.
[3:04:33.600 --> 3:04:36.600]  I hope you join me for the Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[3:04:36.600 --> 3:04:38.600]  and I hope you realize the only reason we're still on air
[3:04:38.600 --> 3:04:40.600]  is because of you.
[3:04:40.600 --> 3:04:42.600]  And I really appreciate you keeping me in the fight
[3:04:42.600 --> 3:04:45.600]  from the bottom of my heart.
[3:04:45.600 --> 3:04:47.600]  From the bottom of my heart, I thank you.
[3:04:47.600 --> 3:04:51.600]  Because we'll stay in this fight.
[3:05:18.600 --> 3:05:24.600]  It's all predicated on having no primacy.
[3:05:24.600 --> 3:05:27.600]  If we simply embrace the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[3:05:27.600 --> 3:05:29.600]  and enforce that against big tech,
[3:05:29.600 --> 3:05:31.600]  they would never get away with this.
[3:05:31.600 --> 3:05:34.600]  But because we're not enforcing our Bill of Rights and Constitution
[3:05:34.600 --> 3:05:38.600]  based in common sense, the bottom is falling out
[3:05:38.600 --> 3:05:40.600]  and the sky is just the beginning.
[3:05:40.600 --> 3:05:42.600]  It's certainly not the limit.
[3:05:42.600 --> 3:05:45.600]  That's why we rediscover what made America great
[3:05:45.600 --> 3:05:47.600]  and what the Renaissance is all about.
[3:05:47.600 --> 3:05:49.600]  True human empowerment.
[3:05:49.600 --> 3:06:15.600]  Welcome back.
[3:06:15.600 --> 3:06:18.600]  I appreciate the Friday afternoons,
[3:06:18.600 --> 3:06:20.600]  especially these days.
[3:06:20.600 --> 3:06:24.600]  I'm kind of picking up where Alex left off today,
[3:06:24.600 --> 3:06:27.600]  talking about how fear is used.
[3:06:27.600 --> 3:06:30.600]  And I know I've hard-bought this a little bit.
[3:06:30.600 --> 3:06:33.600]  Pardon the bun for those that know my work.
[3:06:33.600 --> 3:06:35.600]  But hey, think about this.
[3:06:35.600 --> 3:06:38.600]  For the last several years, I've been talking about this
[3:06:38.600 --> 3:06:42.600]  as one of my main thrusts underlying my discussion
[3:06:42.600 --> 3:06:45.600]  of technology or politics or science
[3:06:45.600 --> 3:06:49.600]  or world affairs on any level is because fear,
[3:06:49.600 --> 3:06:55.600]  as a driver, I know, is so, so destructive to ourselves
[3:06:55.600 --> 3:06:57.600]  and then what comes of it.
[3:06:57.600 --> 3:07:00.600]  Beyond the initial response of flight or flight
[3:07:00.600 --> 3:07:03.600]  that gets our attention, which, you know,
[3:07:03.600 --> 3:07:05.600]  I mean, we hear about this,
[3:07:05.600 --> 3:07:09.600]  and I know Mike Adams talked about this a little bit
[3:07:09.600 --> 3:07:11.600]  in terms of how that kicks in.
[3:07:11.600 --> 3:07:15.600]  And when you think about what we're facing today,
[3:07:15.600 --> 3:07:19.600]  courage is the currency of the 21st century.
[3:07:19.600 --> 3:07:24.600]  Courage, fearlessness, recognizing what we are,
[3:07:24.600 --> 3:07:28.600]  who we are, and where we come from allows us that.
[3:07:28.600 --> 3:07:31.600]  In fact, it's like the free gift of that.
[3:07:31.600 --> 3:07:35.600]  When you know that this dimension is very limited,
[3:07:35.600 --> 3:07:39.600]  you know, physical time and space as we occupy this body,
[3:07:39.600 --> 3:07:43.600]  this carrier with the soul, with the spirit.
[3:07:43.600 --> 3:07:49.600]  This is what many don't recognize as fundamental.
[3:07:49.600 --> 3:07:53.600]  So they become very fearful of the losses associated
[3:07:53.600 --> 3:07:55.600]  with that which they identify with,
[3:07:55.600 --> 3:07:58.600]  which fundamentally begins with the body.
[3:07:58.600 --> 3:08:00.600]  You know, this carcass that we carry around,
[3:08:00.600 --> 3:08:05.600]  of which, if you're my age, in your 60s,
[3:08:05.600 --> 3:08:08.600]  you don't have one single solitary cell
[3:08:08.600 --> 3:08:09.600]  that you were born with.
[3:08:09.600 --> 3:08:13.600]  So I assure you, the physical form is an aspect,
[3:08:13.600 --> 3:08:16.600]  but it's not you, you know?
[3:08:16.600 --> 3:08:19.600]  Okay, when you're born, you come into this world,
[3:08:19.600 --> 3:08:21.600]  and everyone starts telling you what you are
[3:08:21.600 --> 3:08:24.600]  and programming you with what you are.
[3:08:24.600 --> 3:08:26.600]  This is your parents' job.
[3:08:26.600 --> 3:08:27.600]  We can call it programming.
[3:08:27.600 --> 3:08:28.600]  We can call it teaching.
[3:08:28.600 --> 3:08:29.600]  We can call it education.
[3:08:29.600 --> 3:08:33.600]  We can give it a lot of words to give the same meaning.
[3:08:33.600 --> 3:08:35.600]  And this is what's really important here,
[3:08:35.600 --> 3:08:37.600]  is what is the meaning of words
[3:08:37.600 --> 3:08:39.600]  when you hear the globalist talk
[3:08:39.600 --> 3:08:41.600]  and you listen carefully,
[3:08:41.600 --> 3:08:43.600]  not just to the words they say
[3:08:43.600 --> 3:08:45.600]  and what they represent,
[3:08:45.600 --> 3:08:47.600]  but the framework that they're hung on.
[3:08:47.600 --> 3:08:50.600]  And it is, in fact, a framework of fear.
[3:08:50.600 --> 3:08:55.600]  It requires fear to fuel their makers,
[3:08:55.600 --> 3:08:57.600]  because that's how they move the herd,
[3:08:57.600 --> 3:09:01.600]  how they get people to respond in mass the most rapidly.
[3:09:01.600 --> 3:09:04.600]  There was a book I referenced every once in a while,
[3:09:04.600 --> 3:09:06.600]  and I had to pull it again and look at it,
[3:09:06.600 --> 3:09:09.600]  and I didn't realize it's quite as old as it is,
[3:09:09.600 --> 3:09:11.600]  but it's from 1841.
[3:09:11.600 --> 3:09:14.600]  I'll tell you some of the reading material
[3:09:14.600 --> 3:09:16.600]  that I get into, and it's called
[3:09:16.600 --> 3:09:19.600]  Extraordinary Delusions in the Madness of Crowds.
[3:09:19.600 --> 3:09:24.600]  And it's about human nature in the context of other things
[3:09:24.600 --> 3:09:26.600]  that have caused the herd to move,
[3:09:26.600 --> 3:09:29.600]  things that later were proven to be nonsense.
[3:09:29.600 --> 3:09:33.600]  And I'm not saying that this will be proven to be nonsense,
[3:09:33.600 --> 3:09:35.600]  necessarily, but I can tell you
[3:09:35.600 --> 3:09:38.600]  that everybody interested in moving the herd
[3:09:38.600 --> 3:09:41.600]  has taken the opportunity to do so.
[3:09:41.600 --> 3:09:44.600]  And so someone will cloak that under conspiracies
[3:09:44.600 --> 3:09:47.600]  or plans, and some will deal with it otherwise.
[3:09:47.600 --> 3:09:51.600]  But here's the reality of it all.
[3:09:51.600 --> 3:09:55.600]  Everyone takes advantage of opportunity,
[3:09:55.600 --> 3:09:59.600]  and crisis breeds, unfortunately,
[3:09:59.600 --> 3:10:03.600]  opportunity for both bad actors and good actors,
[3:10:03.600 --> 3:10:07.600]  I suppose, because everyone sees this as a time
[3:10:07.600 --> 3:10:09.600]  when big solutions are needed
[3:10:09.600 --> 3:10:14.600]  and maybe big solutions will happen and not incrementally.
[3:10:14.600 --> 3:10:17.600]  But this is where you need to pay attention on the peripheral.
[3:10:17.600 --> 3:10:19.600]  If you look at your daily newspaper,
[3:10:19.600 --> 3:10:21.600]  it's dominated by virus news,
[3:10:21.600 --> 3:10:23.600]  but everything else has been forgotten.
[3:10:23.600 --> 3:10:26.600]  And if you remember, just before this happened,
[3:10:26.600 --> 3:10:28.600]  we had California burning down,
[3:10:28.600 --> 3:10:30.600]  Australia burning down,
[3:10:30.600 --> 3:10:33.600]  we had famine in the Middle East
[3:10:33.600 --> 3:10:35.600]  and North Africa because of locusts.
[3:10:35.600 --> 3:10:38.600]  We had, you know, all these disasters.
[3:10:38.600 --> 3:10:39.600]  We had World War III.
[3:10:39.600 --> 3:10:41.600]  We're standing on the edge of World War III,
[3:10:41.600 --> 3:10:43.600]  and all this is like forgotten,
[3:10:43.600 --> 3:10:47.600]  like it just disappeared evaporator off the pace of the earth.
[3:10:47.600 --> 3:10:49.600]  No, we're not paying attention.
[3:10:49.600 --> 3:10:51.600]  Pay attention.
[3:10:51.600 --> 3:10:52.600]  One of the secrets of life.
[3:10:52.600 --> 3:10:54.600]  Stay calm, pay attention,
[3:10:54.600 --> 3:10:55.600]  and use your peripheral vision,
[3:10:55.600 --> 3:10:57.600]  what's going on on the sidelines.
[3:10:57.600 --> 3:11:02.600]  Because on the sidelines often is where the real action is.
[3:11:02.600 --> 3:11:04.600]  I come from a political family.
[3:11:04.600 --> 3:11:05.600]  Many of you know this.
[3:11:05.600 --> 3:11:09.600]  And often what happens in these events
[3:11:09.600 --> 3:11:13.600]  is every party looks for a way to push their agenda forward.
[3:11:13.600 --> 3:11:14.600]  So you got to pay attention.
[3:11:14.600 --> 3:11:16.600]  Doesn't mean that it will be bad.
[3:11:16.600 --> 3:11:17.600]  Doesn't mean that it will be good,
[3:11:17.600 --> 3:11:20.600]  but it means that we as a Democratic Republic
[3:11:20.600 --> 3:11:23.600]  and those of us who recognize we are the government
[3:11:23.600 --> 3:11:24.600]  need to pay attention.
[3:11:24.600 --> 3:11:26.600]  So pay attention.
[3:11:26.600 --> 3:11:29.600]  You know, when I think about some of the dialogues
[3:11:29.600 --> 3:11:31.600]  that I've witnessed recently,
[3:11:31.600 --> 3:11:33.600]  you know, you talk about the mind control agenda,
[3:11:33.600 --> 3:11:36.600]  the idea of moving people, manipulating people
[3:11:36.600 --> 3:11:39.600]  with the ultimate in the propaganda machine,
[3:11:39.600 --> 3:11:42.600]  the technology that allows you to literally manipulate
[3:11:42.600 --> 3:11:46.600]  brain activity grossly and overtly.
[3:11:46.600 --> 3:11:51.600]  From reading your thoughts in finer and finer detail
[3:11:51.600 --> 3:11:53.600]  from a distance,
[3:11:53.600 --> 3:11:56.600]  knowing whether you experience fear or joy or happiness
[3:11:56.600 --> 3:11:57.600]  at a given moment,
[3:11:57.600 --> 3:12:01.600]  this can be deduced easily nowadays.
[3:12:01.600 --> 3:12:02.600]  More complex thinking is,
[3:12:02.600 --> 3:12:05.600]  it takes a little bit more computing power,
[3:12:05.600 --> 3:12:06.600]  a lot more computing power,
[3:12:06.600 --> 3:12:09.600]  but it is here and quickly arriving.
[3:12:09.600 --> 3:12:14.600]  OK, so this is the full side of what human nature can be.
[3:12:14.600 --> 3:12:19.600]  Augmented humanity, if you will, is what we do.
[3:12:19.600 --> 3:12:21.600]  Whether it's a paddle for a boat,
[3:12:21.600 --> 3:12:23.600]  that's augmented reality too, right?
[3:12:23.600 --> 3:12:26.600]  I mean, because that's not us, it's using a tool.
[3:12:26.600 --> 3:12:30.600]  But these tools that penetrate our minds,
[3:12:30.600 --> 3:12:32.600]  our consciousness, our awareness,
[3:12:32.600 --> 3:12:36.600]  these are either tools or they're the bullets
[3:12:36.600 --> 3:12:38.600]  to shoot us with.
[3:12:38.600 --> 3:12:41.600]  Because, you know, think about it this way,
[3:12:41.600 --> 3:12:43.600]  that same paddle that you're rowing that boat with,
[3:12:43.600 --> 3:12:46.600]  you can take it and beat someone to death with it, right?
[3:12:46.600 --> 3:12:48.600]  So is it a paddle or is it a club?
[3:12:48.600 --> 3:12:50.600]  Again, we're talking about words here.
[3:12:50.600 --> 3:12:52.600]  What do words mean?
[3:12:52.600 --> 3:12:55.600]  Words behind them is intention.
[3:12:55.600 --> 3:12:58.600]  This is the important ingredient, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:12:58.600 --> 3:13:01.600]  You got to get through, that's called discernment,
[3:13:01.600 --> 3:13:03.600]  screening through the words to get to the root
[3:13:03.600 --> 3:13:05.600]  of their intention.
[3:13:05.600 --> 3:13:08.600]  So you can discern the spirit of the words
[3:13:08.600 --> 3:13:11.600]  and what is coming out of that living soul
[3:13:11.600 --> 3:13:14.600]  so you can interpret those words
[3:13:14.600 --> 3:13:17.600]  in the context of your living experience.
[3:13:17.600 --> 3:13:20.600]  And then you, as an independent living soul,
[3:13:20.600 --> 3:13:24.600]  get to make judgment, decisions, choices.
[3:13:24.600 --> 3:13:28.600]  Those are what make you unique.
[3:13:28.600 --> 3:13:32.600]  And the first choice is to maintain control of oneself.
[3:13:32.600 --> 3:13:36.600]  And the second choice is to use that carrier,
[3:13:36.600 --> 3:13:40.600]  to use that self, to carry on a vision of truth
[3:13:40.600 --> 3:13:43.600]  that recognizes the divinity of every living soul.
[3:13:43.600 --> 3:13:47.600]  That isn't there to destroy and tear up and rip apart,
[3:13:47.600 --> 3:13:51.600]  but to build, to recognize, to enlighten,
[3:13:51.600 --> 3:13:54.600]  to invigorate, to bring out of each of us
[3:13:54.600 --> 3:13:57.600]  the very best possibilities that we are.
[3:13:57.600 --> 3:14:00.600]  That is the highest calling.
[3:14:00.600 --> 3:14:03.600]  The recognition that the highest form of love
[3:14:03.600 --> 3:14:06.600]  is friendship and relationship
[3:14:06.600 --> 3:14:09.600]  and the things that unite us and bring us together.
[3:14:09.600 --> 3:14:11.600]  When two or more gather together,
[3:14:11.600 --> 3:14:15.600]  the resonance, the power involved in that
[3:14:15.600 --> 3:14:18.600]  multiplies dramatically.
[3:14:18.600 --> 3:14:20.600]  I was talking about this last week
[3:14:20.600 --> 3:14:22.600]  in the broadcast a little bit.
[3:14:22.600 --> 3:14:27.600]  We even did a group prayer, if you will,
[3:14:27.600 --> 3:14:30.600]  talking about that in the context of quantum physics
[3:14:30.600 --> 3:14:32.600]  and how it really works.
[3:14:32.600 --> 3:14:35.600]  So people who don't have a religious understanding
[3:14:35.600 --> 3:14:37.600]  can at least start to grasp
[3:14:37.600 --> 3:14:39.600]  that we are more than this carrier
[3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:41.600]  and perhaps let go of a bit of fear
[3:14:41.600 --> 3:14:44.600]  and begin to seek, look, seek,
[3:14:44.600 --> 3:14:47.600]  and you shall find the truth of what it is that you need to know.
[3:14:47.600 --> 3:14:49.600]  I believe that absolutely,
[3:14:49.600 --> 3:14:51.600]  but I believe that each of us
[3:14:51.600 --> 3:14:54.600]  is a powerful source of inspiration
[3:14:54.600 --> 3:14:57.600]  to everyone around us if we recognize it.
[3:14:57.600 --> 3:15:00.600]  Even the simplest of things
[3:15:00.600 --> 3:15:03.600]  move mountains.
[3:15:03.600 --> 3:15:05.600]  When we believe that we matter,
[3:15:05.600 --> 3:15:06.600]  that our intention matters,
[3:15:06.600 --> 3:15:08.600]  that what we believe matters
[3:15:08.600 --> 3:15:12.600]  and we express it in the ways that we can
[3:15:12.600 --> 3:15:16.600]  in recognition of the divinity of every living soul.
[3:15:16.600 --> 3:15:18.600]  When I begin the broadcast,
[3:15:18.600 --> 3:15:21.600]  sometimes I kind of wonder where it's going to go
[3:15:21.600 --> 3:15:24.600]  and today it went in a bit of a different direction,
[3:15:24.600 --> 3:15:27.600]  but I think an important thing for this hour,
[3:15:27.600 --> 3:15:29.600]  for this moment, for this time
[3:15:29.600 --> 3:15:32.600]  is to recognize the potency of what we are
[3:15:32.600 --> 3:15:35.600]  and not let these globalists tell us how insignificant we are,
[3:15:35.600 --> 3:15:38.600]  how we are dust at their feet, because we are not.
[3:15:38.600 --> 3:15:40.600]  We are the tip of the spear
[3:15:40.600 --> 3:15:42.600]  and you're in this war with us.
[3:15:42.600 --> 3:15:43.600]  This is the info wall.
[3:15:43.600 --> 3:15:46.600]  This is Dr. Nick Babich. We'll be right back.
[3:15:46.600 --> 3:15:51.600]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:15:51.600 --> 3:15:53.600]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[3:15:53.600 --> 3:15:55.600]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:15:55.600 --> 3:15:56.600]  I sued the IRS and won.
[3:15:56.600 --> 3:15:58.600]  I beat the IRS then
[3:15:58.600 --> 3:15:59.600]  and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:15:59.600 --> 3:16:01.600]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[3:16:01.600 --> 3:16:03.600]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[3:16:03.600 --> 3:16:05.600]  they thought might never be solved.
[3:16:05.600 --> 3:16:06.600]  I can help you too.
[3:16:06.600 --> 3:16:09.600]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:16:09.600 --> 3:16:11.600]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:16:11.600 --> 3:16:13.600]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX
[3:16:13.600 --> 3:16:16.600]  or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[3:16:16.600 --> 3:16:19.600]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:16:19.600 --> 3:16:21.600]  The United States of Empire
[3:16:21.600 --> 3:16:23.600]  is a book that claims the United States
[3:16:23.600 --> 3:16:26.600]  is the empire of the world.
[3:16:26.600 --> 3:16:29.600]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[3:16:29.600 --> 3:16:31.600]  The United States of Empire
[3:16:31.600 --> 3:16:33.600]  shows that World Wars I and II
[3:16:33.600 --> 3:16:35.600]  left England broken.
[3:16:35.600 --> 3:16:37.600]  Its former colony, the U.S.,
[3:16:37.600 --> 3:16:39.600]  had to save the empire.
[3:16:39.600 --> 3:16:40.600]  Was there ever a vote?
[3:16:40.600 --> 3:16:41.600]  Who do we fight for?
[3:16:41.600 --> 3:16:44.600]  The deep state began with World War I.
[3:16:44.600 --> 3:16:46.600]  The United States of Empire
[3:16:46.600 --> 3:16:50.600]  by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[3:17:20.600 --> 3:17:23.600]  Fellow patriots, my name is Todd Savage,
[3:17:23.600 --> 3:17:25.600]  founder of Black Rifle Real Estate.com.
[3:17:25.600 --> 3:17:27.600]  Like you, I was a prisoner
[3:17:27.600 --> 3:17:29.600]  in an out-left sanctuary state
[3:17:29.600 --> 3:17:31.600]  until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[3:17:31.600 --> 3:17:33.600]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead
[3:17:33.600 --> 3:17:35.600]  where we shoot, hunt, garden,
[3:17:35.600 --> 3:17:37.600]  and homeschool our children
[3:17:37.600 --> 3:17:39.600]  without the tyranny of the nanny state looking ogres.
[3:17:39.600 --> 3:17:41.600]  If you're ready to flee the city
[3:17:41.600 --> 3:17:43.600]  to the freedom of Idaho or Montana,
[3:17:43.600 --> 3:17:45.600]  our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help.
[3:17:45.600 --> 3:17:47.600]  Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[3:17:47.600 --> 3:17:49.600]  That's BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[3:17:51.600 --> 3:17:53.600]  Hey?
[3:17:53.600 --> 3:17:56.600]  Listen, Alex Jones and the resistance are still on here.
[3:17:56.600 --> 3:17:58.600]  They're at band.video.
[3:17:58.600 --> 3:18:00.600]  At infowars.com.
[3:18:00.600 --> 3:18:02.600]  All you gotta do is go to infowars.com.
[3:18:02.600 --> 3:18:04.600]  For its last show, you'll find Alex Jones' broadcast.
[3:18:04.600 --> 3:18:06.600]  Live, you'll find Owen Schroer
[3:18:06.600 --> 3:18:08.600]  at the War Room, David Knight,
[3:18:08.600 --> 3:18:11.600]  and so much more special broadcasts, films,
[3:18:11.600 --> 3:18:13.600]  emergency reports.
[3:18:13.600 --> 3:18:15.600]  It's all there.
[3:18:15.600 --> 3:18:17.600]  And the globalists have worked around the clock
[3:18:17.600 --> 3:18:19.600]  to take him off here, but something's happening.
[3:18:19.600 --> 3:18:21.600]  The public has been spreading the word
[3:18:21.600 --> 3:18:23.600]  that the forbidden truth lives
[3:18:23.600 --> 3:18:25.600]  at infowars.com.
[3:18:25.600 --> 3:18:28.600]  It's all about video, and it's growing exponentially,
[3:18:28.600 --> 3:18:31.600]  and the attempts to censor are only backfiring.
[3:18:31.600 --> 3:18:33.600]  But we can supercharge this right now.
[3:18:33.600 --> 3:18:35.600]  If all of you listening realize,
[3:18:35.600 --> 3:18:37.600]  hey, you know how to find the show,
[3:18:37.600 --> 3:18:39.600]  but other people don't.
[3:18:39.600 --> 3:18:41.600]  They believe mainstream media that was off the air,
[3:18:41.600 --> 3:18:44.600]  so you can override the corporate media,
[3:18:44.600 --> 3:18:46.600]  the establishment, all of them at this critical time
[3:18:46.600 --> 3:18:48.600]  and tell folks that the truth lives
[3:18:48.600 --> 3:18:51.600]  and is back on air at infowars.com.
[3:18:51.600 --> 3:18:53.600]  As men age,
[3:18:53.600 --> 3:18:56.600]  they often experience a slowdown
[3:18:56.600 --> 3:18:58.600]  in vitality, energy,
[3:18:58.600 --> 3:19:01.600]  and overall wellness.
[3:19:01.600 --> 3:19:05.600]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas
[3:19:05.600 --> 3:19:08.600]  to date, Super Male Vitality,
[3:19:08.600 --> 3:19:11.600]  specifically designed to assist the body
[3:19:11.600 --> 3:19:13.600]  in regulating proper balance
[3:19:13.600 --> 3:19:17.600]  to create superior vitality in males.
[3:19:17.600 --> 3:19:19.600]  Now look, this unique formula
[3:19:19.600 --> 3:19:22.600]  promotes your body's own natural responses
[3:19:22.600 --> 3:19:25.600]  and it contains no synthetic chemicals
[3:19:25.600 --> 3:19:28.600]  and no unwanted additives.
[3:19:28.600 --> 3:19:29.600]  Yes.
[3:19:29.600 --> 3:19:31.600]  We're talking about ancient wisdom
[3:19:31.600 --> 3:19:34.600]  combined with modern technology.
[3:19:34.600 --> 3:19:37.600]  Working together in perfect synchronicity
[3:19:37.600 --> 3:19:41.600]  to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[3:19:41.600 --> 3:19:42.600]  So what are you waiting for?
[3:19:42.600 --> 3:19:44.600]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[3:19:44.600 --> 3:19:46.600]  Never been a better time than right now.
[3:19:46.600 --> 3:19:52.600]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:20:17.600 --> 3:20:21.600]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:24.600 --> 3:20:25.600]  And welcome back.
[3:20:25.600 --> 3:20:27.600]  You know, people always ask,
[3:20:27.600 --> 3:20:30.600]  how can you be smiling at a time like this?
[3:20:30.600 --> 3:20:32.600]  You know, and I can't help.
[3:20:32.600 --> 3:20:34.600]  And I want to talk about that for a second.
[3:20:34.600 --> 3:20:39.600]  And really, kind of my approach to a lot of this is,
[3:20:39.600 --> 3:20:43.600]  first I want to say I'm really grateful.
[3:20:43.600 --> 3:20:47.600]  I live in a state of gratefulness, if you will,
[3:20:47.600 --> 3:20:50.600]  for having the opportunity and really the privilege
[3:20:50.600 --> 3:20:53.600]  and responsibility of being able to talk to people
[3:20:53.600 --> 3:20:56.600]  and being able to inform the public
[3:20:56.600 --> 3:20:58.600]  in a way that is a bit different.
[3:20:58.600 --> 3:21:01.600]  I spend eight hours, more or less a day,
[3:21:01.600 --> 3:21:04.600]  reading, studying, taking in information.
[3:21:04.600 --> 3:21:06.600]  And I use a lot of different sources.
[3:21:06.600 --> 3:21:08.600]  And one of them I want to mention,
[3:21:08.600 --> 3:21:12.600]  because it goes back to my very, very beginnings 25 years ago.
[3:21:12.600 --> 3:21:15.600]  And this one became one of the alternate news feeds.
[3:21:15.600 --> 3:21:18.600]  I mean, people know about Zero Hedge and they know about Drudge.
[3:21:18.600 --> 3:21:21.600]  And of course, everyone who's listening knows about InfoWars.
[3:21:21.600 --> 3:21:26.600]  But one of the other news sources out there is Nexus News Feed,
[3:21:26.600 --> 3:21:29.600]  which is operated by Duncan Rhodes.
[3:21:29.600 --> 3:21:31.600]  And it's an alternative news source.
[3:21:31.600 --> 3:21:36.600]  It covers 15 or 16 areas, everything, politics,
[3:21:36.600 --> 3:21:40.600]  weird esoteric stuff, you know, the brain,
[3:21:40.600 --> 3:21:42.600]  the latest stuff and mind effects.
[3:21:42.600 --> 3:21:45.600]  I mean, it's like all the conspiracy stuff also, you know.
[3:21:45.600 --> 3:21:47.600]  So all those things, before they become reality,
[3:21:47.600 --> 3:21:50.600]  when they're still being titled Conspiracy, shows up there.
[3:21:50.600 --> 3:21:53.600]  But it's a great news feed for general information.
[3:21:53.600 --> 3:21:56.600]  Like everything, you know, look at each article,
[3:21:56.600 --> 3:21:58.600]  because there are a lot of different resources there,
[3:21:58.600 --> 3:22:00.600]  because it's an aggregator.
[3:22:00.600 --> 3:22:02.600]  They're grabbing stuff from all over the world
[3:22:02.600 --> 3:22:05.600]  and shoving it into one place so people can get it in one place.
[3:22:05.600 --> 3:22:08.600]  Like what Zero Hedge does with their news feeds
[3:22:08.600 --> 3:22:11.600]  and what Drudge does and what InfoWars does.
[3:22:11.600 --> 3:22:13.600]  We gather data to make it available.
[3:22:13.600 --> 3:22:16.600]  So Nexus News Feed, I encourage people to take a look at.
[3:22:16.600 --> 3:22:18.600]  If I'm plugging them instead of me this week,
[3:22:18.600 --> 3:22:21.600]  I really appreciate what they've done for me
[3:22:21.600 --> 3:22:25.600]  in publicizing my work, like what InfoWars does for all of us.
[3:22:25.600 --> 3:22:32.600]  And, you know, InfoWarsStore.com is the source that keeps us going.
[3:22:32.600 --> 3:22:35.600]  You know, and I do this volunteer as a volunteer effort.
[3:22:35.600 --> 3:22:38.600]  This is what I consider my public service work.
[3:22:38.600 --> 3:22:41.600]  This work, because this is really fundamental
[3:22:41.600 --> 3:22:43.600]  to who we are informing the public.
[3:22:43.600 --> 3:22:45.600]  So I do this and I make my living elsewhere,
[3:22:45.600 --> 3:22:48.600]  which is great. It allows me to do this.
[3:22:48.600 --> 3:22:51.600]  But what it also is is a big responsibility.
[3:22:51.600 --> 3:22:54.600]  And the responsibility I don't take with a heavy heart.
[3:22:54.600 --> 3:23:00.600]  I take it very deeply, but not in that sense of stress,
[3:23:00.600 --> 3:23:03.600]  but in a sense of gratitude and joy,
[3:23:03.600 --> 3:23:10.600]  because I know that an informed public is a powerful public.
[3:23:10.600 --> 3:23:12.600]  It's not one being hurted by emotion.
[3:23:12.600 --> 3:23:17.600]  It's being directed by intellect, tied with the emotion.
[3:23:17.600 --> 3:23:19.600]  The thing that makes us so unique is human beings.
[3:23:19.600 --> 3:23:22.600]  And we can put those two aspects of the mind,
[3:23:22.600 --> 3:23:25.600]  of the brain together, literally the left and right hemisphere,
[3:23:25.600 --> 3:23:30.600]  these two sides, we bring them together into a unit
[3:23:30.600 --> 3:23:33.600]  and we don't let one dominate and the other be silent.
[3:23:33.600 --> 3:23:35.600]  This is not how we were created.
[3:23:35.600 --> 3:23:38.600]  And this is one of the secrets, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:23:38.600 --> 3:23:43.600]  of how new world order structures use fear.
[3:23:43.600 --> 3:23:46.600]  Because when you engage fear, what happens is
[3:23:46.600 --> 3:23:49.600]  the right side of the brain is engaged
[3:23:49.600 --> 3:23:51.600]  and it shuts down a bit of the function
[3:23:51.600 --> 3:23:54.600]  of the logical reasoning rational side.
[3:23:54.600 --> 3:23:56.600]  What you need is these two in harmony.
[3:23:56.600 --> 3:23:58.600]  So the emotional drives the intellect
[3:23:58.600 --> 3:24:01.600]  rather than the other way around.
[3:24:01.600 --> 3:24:05.600]  And this is important because we're meant to behold human beings,
[3:24:05.600 --> 3:24:08.600]  not fragmented by one side of the brain or the other.
[3:24:08.600 --> 3:24:10.600]  So much of our education system,
[3:24:10.600 --> 3:24:13.600]  so much of what comes at us is designed
[3:24:13.600 --> 3:24:15.600]  to trigger one side or the other
[3:24:15.600 --> 3:24:19.600]  and to really separate us internally.
[3:24:19.600 --> 3:24:23.600]  Because when we're born, we have a very balanced system,
[3:24:23.600 --> 3:24:25.600]  more balanced than as we age
[3:24:25.600 --> 3:24:29.600]  and as the layering of experience or what we call education
[3:24:29.600 --> 3:24:32.600]  or programming or whatever words you want to use again
[3:24:32.600 --> 3:24:34.600]  for those words that are important,
[3:24:34.600 --> 3:24:36.600]  for structuring what happens then.
[3:24:36.600 --> 3:24:40.600]  And so as you layer it up, the brain separates
[3:24:40.600 --> 3:24:42.600]  in terms of where your focus is.
[3:24:42.600 --> 3:24:45.600]  And what that does is fragment you as a human being
[3:24:45.600 --> 3:24:48.600]  and begin to break down what you are as a human being.
[3:24:48.600 --> 3:24:52.600]  So part of the mission is, and you can read it, right?
[3:24:52.600 --> 3:24:54.600]  Be as little children.
[3:24:54.600 --> 3:24:56.600]  What does that really mean?
[3:24:56.600 --> 3:24:59.600]  You need to contemplate these words
[3:24:59.600 --> 3:25:02.600]  on the framework of what we now know.
[3:25:02.600 --> 3:25:06.600]  And what we know is those word symbols
[3:25:06.600 --> 3:25:10.600]  from way in the past are valid.
[3:25:10.600 --> 3:25:12.600]  They operate under rules and laws
[3:25:12.600 --> 3:25:14.600]  that we just didn't understand then,
[3:25:14.600 --> 3:25:16.600]  that we have a greater understanding now,
[3:25:16.600 --> 3:25:18.600]  but that does not make us all wise.
[3:25:18.600 --> 3:25:20.600]  In fact, that's where we've got to really scrutinize.
[3:25:20.600 --> 3:25:24.600]  You know, and really smart people sometimes get lost
[3:25:24.600 --> 3:25:27.600]  on the intellectual side and they lose their connection.
[3:25:27.600 --> 3:25:30.600]  And that emotional side also connects the heart,
[3:25:30.600 --> 3:25:33.600]  what we call the heart, whatever that really means.
[3:25:33.600 --> 3:25:36.600]  And it's the way we express ourselves in the world,
[3:25:36.600 --> 3:25:37.600]  how we create.
[3:25:37.600 --> 3:25:40.600]  Why is creation so valued?
[3:25:40.600 --> 3:25:43.600]  Because this is the essence of what we are,
[3:25:43.600 --> 3:25:47.600]  as both created human beings and co-creators,
[3:25:47.600 --> 3:25:49.600]  as created human beings.
[3:25:49.600 --> 3:25:51.600]  And what the physics shows us.
[3:25:51.600 --> 3:25:53.600]  If you look back on last week's segment,
[3:25:53.600 --> 3:25:55.600]  I want to reiterate all that.
[3:25:55.600 --> 3:25:57.600]  And so this is all important structurally
[3:25:57.600 --> 3:25:59.600]  to be a prepared human being.
[3:25:59.600 --> 3:26:01.600]  And right now, while we're all sitting at home
[3:26:01.600 --> 3:26:03.600]  with our wives, with our children,
[3:26:03.600 --> 3:26:05.600]  with the people that we care about,
[3:26:05.600 --> 3:26:07.600]  that we have a relationship with,
[3:26:07.600 --> 3:26:09.600]  our deepest relationships,
[3:26:09.600 --> 3:26:11.600]  we can reform those.
[3:26:11.600 --> 3:26:14.600]  And at the same time, we can look within ourselves
[3:26:14.600 --> 3:26:17.600]  and sort of reset the clock,
[3:26:17.600 --> 3:26:20.600]  getting sort of the veil of the propaganda
[3:26:20.600 --> 3:26:22.600]  that surrounds us in our daily life.
[3:26:22.600 --> 3:26:24.600]  Because our routines are broken.
[3:26:24.600 --> 3:26:28.600]  It provides also this opportunity for self-reflection,
[3:26:28.600 --> 3:26:32.600]  change, recognitions,
[3:26:32.600 --> 3:26:35.600]  that we can then talk to our family,
[3:26:35.600 --> 3:26:38.600]  engage those that are important to us.
[3:26:38.600 --> 3:26:41.600]  So that we can then, coming out of this,
[3:26:41.600 --> 3:26:44.600]  we are the warrior.
[3:26:44.600 --> 3:26:47.600]  But we are coming out of our training opportunities
[3:26:47.600 --> 3:26:50.600]  because now we can focus a little bit.
[3:26:50.600 --> 3:26:52.600]  If we can just let go of the fear long enough
[3:26:52.600 --> 3:26:55.600]  to cultivate who we individually are,
[3:26:55.600 --> 3:26:57.600]  to begin to recognize and go back
[3:26:57.600 --> 3:27:00.600]  to our root of who we are.
[3:27:00.600 --> 3:27:03.600]  So we can reclaim that root
[3:27:03.600 --> 3:27:05.600]  and express ourselves
[3:27:05.600 --> 3:27:07.600]  as creative living beings
[3:27:07.600 --> 3:27:09.600]  in what we do each day individually
[3:27:09.600 --> 3:27:12.600]  and recognizing a couple of things.
[3:27:12.600 --> 3:27:14.600]  Faith is a simple thing.
[3:27:14.600 --> 3:27:19.600]  It's acting on what you know to be right and true.
[3:27:19.600 --> 3:27:21.600]  What you absolutely can believe in.
[3:27:21.600 --> 3:27:23.600]  It's as simple as that.
[3:27:23.600 --> 3:27:25.600]  And here's where people get confused.
[3:27:25.600 --> 3:27:26.600]  You know, they go,
[3:27:26.600 --> 3:27:28.600]  oh, I can't have faith to do this or that
[3:27:28.600 --> 3:27:29.600]  because it's too big.
[3:27:29.600 --> 3:27:31.600]  Well, don't do that.
[3:27:31.600 --> 3:27:32.600]  That's not faith.
[3:27:32.600 --> 3:27:33.600]  That's hope.
[3:27:33.600 --> 3:27:34.600]  You can have hope.
[3:27:34.600 --> 3:27:36.600]  But then you do what you can do, which is faith.
[3:27:36.600 --> 3:27:40.600]  You know, teaching is part of what happens
[3:27:40.600 --> 3:27:42.600]  on info wars.
[3:27:42.600 --> 3:27:43.600]  Not just information,
[3:27:43.600 --> 3:27:45.600]  but we're trying to provide a context
[3:27:45.600 --> 3:27:48.600]  for what do we do with it, you know, in a sensible way.
[3:27:48.600 --> 3:27:50.600]  So we just don't get more jacked up
[3:27:50.600 --> 3:27:52.600]  like everybody else.
[3:27:52.600 --> 3:27:56.600]  No, we got to jack into ourselves a little bit
[3:27:56.600 --> 3:27:58.600]  and disconnect a little bit
[3:27:58.600 --> 3:28:02.600]  from the electronic gulag
[3:28:02.600 --> 3:28:03.600]  that we're all in,
[3:28:03.600 --> 3:28:06.600]  whether we recognize it or not.
[3:28:06.600 --> 3:28:08.600]  You're in it.
[3:28:08.600 --> 3:28:11.600]  You're in that gulag already
[3:28:11.600 --> 3:28:14.600]  because of the way the system has imprisoned us,
[3:28:14.600 --> 3:28:16.600]  not just in our homes,
[3:28:16.600 --> 3:28:19.600]  which metaphorically you can have the walls broken down.
[3:28:19.600 --> 3:28:22.600]  But as long as every move you make,
[3:28:22.600 --> 3:28:23.600]  every step you take,
[3:28:23.600 --> 3:28:26.600]  every breath you take and everything you do
[3:28:26.600 --> 3:28:28.600]  and every movement and everyone you're close to
[3:28:28.600 --> 3:28:30.600]  and every time you cross paths
[3:28:30.600 --> 3:28:32.600]  with another electronic device,
[3:28:32.600 --> 3:28:34.600]  it's recorded and trapped.
[3:28:34.600 --> 3:28:37.600]  Everything, everything.
[3:28:37.600 --> 3:28:39.600]  This is the false reality.
[3:28:39.600 --> 3:28:41.600]  This is the antichrist.
[3:28:41.600 --> 3:28:43.600]  We're in the 21st century.
[3:28:43.600 --> 3:28:44.600]  Time to wake up.
[3:28:44.600 --> 3:28:46.600]  America, this is the info wars.
[3:28:46.600 --> 3:29:08.600]  We'll be right back.
[3:29:16.600 --> 3:29:21.600]  We're in the 21st century.
[3:29:47.600 --> 3:29:50.600]  That's it.
[3:29:50.600 --> 3:29:51.600]  That's all.
[3:29:51.600 --> 3:29:55.600]  It was offered by Veterans Vitality Premium CBD.
[3:29:55.600 --> 3:29:58.600]  We told you it was coming.
[3:29:58.600 --> 3:30:01.600]  We told you that you used a virus
[3:30:01.600 --> 3:30:03.600]  to scare everyone into submission
[3:30:03.600 --> 3:30:05.600]  and set up martial law and quarantines and lockdowns
[3:30:05.600 --> 3:30:07.600]  and now it's here.
[3:30:07.600 --> 3:30:09.600]  And I'm here to tell you the rest of the story.
[3:30:09.600 --> 3:30:12.600]  Three things we all need to do is pray to God
[3:30:12.600 --> 3:30:14.600]  for justice and seek His face and repent.
[3:30:14.600 --> 3:30:20.700]  being announced and get prepared yourselves and boost your immune systems and get high
[3:30:20.700 --> 3:30:21.700]  quality food.
[3:30:21.700 --> 3:30:24.740]  And we're able to ship storeable food again.
[3:30:24.740 --> 3:30:29.580]  Our supplier has expanded their factories and now are able to take new wars and it's
[3:30:29.580 --> 3:30:32.620]  not about this virus folks, that's only the trigger, the detonator.
[3:30:32.620 --> 3:30:36.380]  It's about what's coming in the future with elections may be canceled, with the global
[3:30:36.380 --> 3:30:38.060]  is trying to implode the economy.
[3:30:38.060 --> 3:30:42.860]  This is just the beginning of the crisis, not the middle and not the end.
[3:30:42.860 --> 3:30:47.740]  So get prepared now while you still can at mforestore.com and please be Paul Ramirez
[3:30:47.740 --> 3:31:17.700]  and spread the word.
[3:31:17.740 --> 3:31:47.420]  I'm Paul Ramirez and I'll see you in the next video.

[3:32:54.860 --> 3:33:19.220]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:19.220 --> 3:33:26.740]  Welcome back and you know when I think about all this, you know, is it matters, you know,
[3:33:26.740 --> 3:33:28.460]  it matters what we do.
[3:33:28.460 --> 3:33:33.580]  It matters every day and every one of us is significant whether we know it or not.
[3:33:33.580 --> 3:33:37.740]  Let me tell you something about that because everyone thinks, you know, I was talking to
[3:33:37.740 --> 3:33:42.020]  a friend of mine and he's a great artist.
[3:33:42.020 --> 3:33:43.260]  He's really well known artist.
[3:33:43.260 --> 3:33:48.820]  I'm talking to him on the phone and he goes, well, Nick, he goes, I can't believe I can
[3:33:48.820 --> 3:33:55.060]  just talk to you on the phone and I said, you know, I'm just like you and and people
[3:33:55.060 --> 3:33:56.060]  forget this.
[3:33:56.060 --> 3:34:02.020]  You know, they they hold some of us because we're out in front a little bit in this weird
[3:34:02.020 --> 3:34:06.540]  kind of place that makes me at least really uncomfortable, you know, and because here's
[3:34:06.540 --> 3:34:07.540]  what I know.
[3:34:07.540 --> 3:34:08.660]  I get to do this.
[3:34:08.660 --> 3:34:10.820]  I'm so thankful for that.
[3:34:10.820 --> 3:34:14.100]  But what I know is it's not what I'm doing that matters.
[3:34:14.100 --> 3:34:15.700]  It's what you're doing that matters.
[3:34:15.700 --> 3:34:18.100]  What Alex was saying before.
[3:34:18.100 --> 3:34:23.380]  And this is the fundamental thing that unites the entire team at InfoWars because at the
[3:34:23.380 --> 3:34:30.100]  end of the day, it's about empowering you, you see, because if you're not empowered,
[3:34:30.100 --> 3:34:31.460]  then none of this matters.
[3:34:31.460 --> 3:34:36.460]  If you guys don't act on what you know to be right and true, and I'm not saying, please,
[3:34:36.460 --> 3:34:40.180]  please, no violent acts because that isn't going to get us there.
[3:34:40.180 --> 3:34:44.580]  It's just going to perpetuate the same problems and give people an excuse to lock it down
[3:34:44.580 --> 3:34:45.580]  tighter.
[3:34:45.580 --> 3:34:50.220]  So we have to do it a different way, and that's the challenge of the 21st century.
[3:34:50.220 --> 3:34:52.220]  That's our challenge.
[3:34:52.220 --> 3:34:56.020]  And people ask me in terms of the spiritual side of my life, you know, everyone's waiting
[3:34:56.020 --> 3:35:00.780]  for me to declare who I am in terms of my religious background.
[3:35:00.780 --> 3:35:01.780]  And you know what?
[3:35:01.780 --> 3:35:02.780]  I'm not going to do it for you.
[3:35:02.780 --> 3:35:08.060]  If you can't tell by the fruits of who I am, who I am and what I'm doing, you never will.
[3:35:08.060 --> 3:35:11.740]  And I'm not going to do that any more than Thomas Jefferson did.
[3:35:11.740 --> 3:35:15.500]  You know, you ever read the Jefferson Bible, I recommend it.
[3:35:15.500 --> 3:35:19.140]  What he did is just take all the highlighted portions of what Christ said, and that was
[3:35:19.140 --> 3:35:23.220]  his sort of condensed version of what was important to remember.
[3:35:23.220 --> 3:35:26.340]  And I like that approach quite frankly.
[3:35:26.340 --> 3:35:30.100]  And this was a man who declared religious freedom as fundamental to who we are.
[3:35:30.100 --> 3:35:32.660]  And why did he do that?
[3:35:32.660 --> 3:35:37.460]  Because people evolve, learn, and I'm not talking about evolving like from an eighth.
[3:35:37.460 --> 3:35:42.660]  I'm talking about individually, when we're born, we begin to learn and we have to discern
[3:35:42.660 --> 3:35:47.980]  in some time in our life, we have to come to a decision point about what we believe,
[3:35:47.980 --> 3:35:49.380]  what's real.
[3:35:49.380 --> 3:35:54.340]  And I came to mind a long time ago, and those that know me know, and here's what I know
[3:35:54.340 --> 3:36:00.700]  about that, is it's tough if you got to really work an overdrive brain to get there.
[3:36:00.700 --> 3:36:03.500]  But when you do, it's a powerful thing.
[3:36:03.500 --> 3:36:08.620]  And I believe in the inspired word, and if you were listening the last couple of sections,
[3:36:08.620 --> 3:36:12.740]  I came into this show with an idea of what I was going to do, and then go that way.
[3:36:12.740 --> 3:36:14.500]  It happens a lot.
[3:36:14.500 --> 3:36:25.140]  Because I know what that is, to express yourself through that way, when the Holy Spirit descends
[3:36:25.140 --> 3:36:31.380]  on you and gives you those words in that moment, you just got to do it.
[3:36:31.380 --> 3:36:34.820]  And it happens a lot with the other hosts as well.
[3:36:34.820 --> 3:36:39.980]  We think we got to plan for the day, and it just kind of gets sidelined.
[3:36:39.980 --> 3:36:41.940]  And so, that's part of it.
[3:36:41.940 --> 3:36:46.700]  But why I bring all this up is because I want to emphasize something.
[3:36:46.700 --> 3:36:50.820]  And I've used this example often, where you could be walking down the street, maybe not
[3:36:50.820 --> 3:36:54.660]  so much anymore, maybe walking on the other side of the street from someone.
[3:36:54.660 --> 3:36:59.220]  And you know, you acknowledge, and you know what that's happening a lot more as I walked
[3:36:59.220 --> 3:37:03.580]  around my neighborhood here in Alaska, people are acknowledging each other.
[3:37:03.580 --> 3:37:06.580]  Boy, isn't that a change?
[3:37:06.580 --> 3:37:11.780]  Wouldn't that be nice to keep that change where we can look into each other's eyes and
[3:37:11.780 --> 3:37:15.020]  see who's in there?
[3:37:15.020 --> 3:37:21.500]  You know, see beyond the shell and see a little bit of perhaps ourselves and the creation
[3:37:21.500 --> 3:37:27.540]  that we are in that other human being, and maybe change the way that we run our game
[3:37:27.540 --> 3:37:30.260]  plan in terms of our lives in the future.
[3:37:30.260 --> 3:37:34.820]  I think that's perhaps the greatest thing that may come out of this shared trauma of
[3:37:34.820 --> 3:37:41.620]  having our economy crunch and the New World order jerking us around.
[3:37:41.620 --> 3:37:46.820]  And so, I want to shift a bit as I get into the rest of this segment into the next one
[3:37:46.820 --> 3:37:51.900]  and talk about some of the things on a material physical plane that we're dealing with right
[3:37:51.900 --> 3:37:56.700]  now, because that's hurting a lot of people right now.
[3:37:56.700 --> 3:38:02.180]  And unemployment is projected to go to as high as 32%.
[3:38:02.180 --> 3:38:07.860]  This is 7% more than the Great Depression of the 1930s.
[3:38:07.860 --> 3:38:13.140]  We have no comprehension of this, because there aren't very many people alive who remember
[3:38:13.140 --> 3:38:16.700]  the 1930s and what led up to it.
[3:38:16.700 --> 3:38:22.820]  And what led up to it is the roaring 20s, where you could call it what we've been doing
[3:38:22.820 --> 3:38:28.140]  for the last 10 years in terms of the economy.
[3:38:28.140 --> 3:38:29.140]  But it's a false economy.
[3:38:29.140 --> 3:38:36.500]  It's based on the fire hose approach of everybody's retirement money, 401Ks, everything raw,
[3:38:36.500 --> 3:38:41.180]  traditional, shoved into this fire hose pointed at the stock market, because there's no place
[3:38:41.180 --> 3:38:43.660]  else to point it for the average person.
[3:38:43.660 --> 3:38:45.100]  So what happens?
[3:38:45.100 --> 3:38:50.340]  It's going to overheat every 10 to 12 years and be overfueled because it'll be overpriced
[3:38:50.340 --> 3:38:52.700]  because too much money is going in there.
[3:38:52.700 --> 3:38:56.100]  And so then the globalists have a plan.
[3:38:56.100 --> 3:39:02.780]  And anytime the opportunity presents itself, they've already put all their chips in place.
[3:39:02.780 --> 3:39:08.700]  And so they just rake off all that productive wealth that everybody has created and steal
[3:39:08.700 --> 3:39:18.740]  it from you in these crashes of markets that are based on false money, false companies,
[3:39:18.740 --> 3:39:26.820]  false values, false, fake, everything, fake politics, fake news, fake world around us
[3:39:26.820 --> 3:39:32.060]  being engineered to push us around and move us around.
[3:39:32.060 --> 3:39:37.660]  And this is what this pause in all of our lives might give us an opportunity to reflect
[3:39:37.660 --> 3:39:42.260]  on a little bit in terms of how we re-engage the world coming out of this with a little
[3:39:42.260 --> 3:39:48.700]  more vigor, a little more attention, and perhaps a little more focus, and maybe a little
[3:39:48.700 --> 3:39:53.660]  more depth of humanity in all of this.
[3:39:53.660 --> 3:39:59.580]  Because here's what also happens to politicians coming from three generations of politicians
[3:39:59.580 --> 3:40:00.820]  and statesmen.
[3:40:00.820 --> 3:40:02.220]  And there's a difference.
[3:40:02.220 --> 3:40:09.460]  I can tell you, looking at the landscape, they'll listen when the pitchforks are out.
[3:40:09.460 --> 3:40:14.900]  And I'm not talking the violence of that metaphorically when the public pays attention
[3:40:14.900 --> 3:40:18.460]  and start full levers differently, things change.
[3:40:18.460 --> 3:40:21.860]  And one of the things that every one of us can do talking about pulling levers to another
[3:40:21.860 --> 3:40:26.660]  next thing that comes up is, oh, they're rigged the elections, paper, ballots, we use paper
[3:40:26.660 --> 3:40:27.660]  ballots.
[3:40:27.660 --> 3:40:33.660]  I'm not talking punch holes, paper ink, and paper ink, not pencils, ink and paper so you
[3:40:33.660 --> 3:40:34.980]  can recount.
[3:40:34.980 --> 3:40:41.260]  Some things should never, ever, ever be automated, and the voting booth is one of them.
[3:40:41.260 --> 3:40:44.460]  And the tabulation of votes is one of them.
[3:40:44.460 --> 3:40:48.660]  This is the only way where you're going to have free and fair elections ever.
[3:40:48.660 --> 3:40:54.700]  Sorry, I don't have a cop button.
[3:40:54.700 --> 3:40:55.700]  But it is.
[3:40:55.700 --> 3:40:56.700]  It's the only way.
[3:40:56.700 --> 3:41:03.380]  And when you look at it across the platforms of what's going on right now, fears being
[3:41:03.380 --> 3:41:04.380]  injected.
[3:41:04.380 --> 3:41:07.020]  Now, what is a big sideline agenda?
[3:41:07.020 --> 3:41:14.300]  One that's been talked about on the broadcast by others, and I want to mention it again,
[3:41:14.300 --> 3:41:16.060]  digital currency.
[3:41:16.060 --> 3:41:22.340]  And the whole thought of it was tried to slip it in under this last bill.
[3:41:22.340 --> 3:41:26.340]  But the other place where it shows up is the Bank of International Settlements.
[3:41:26.340 --> 3:41:31.940]  Now this is a consortium of 60 countries, 600 top banks in the world that sort of push
[3:41:31.940 --> 3:41:32.940]  policy.
[3:41:32.940 --> 3:41:38.140]  And what they're pushing right now is this electronic currency for our own safety, of
[3:41:38.140 --> 3:41:39.140]  course.
[3:41:39.140 --> 3:41:43.780]  And if you believe that, I've got a few bridges for sale in San Francisco.
[3:41:43.780 --> 3:41:48.460]  But the point of the matter is, it's BS, and we all know it's BS.
[3:41:48.460 --> 3:41:50.340]  It's about control and manipulation.
[3:41:50.340 --> 3:41:51.780]  Now they're not the only group.
[3:41:51.780 --> 3:41:59.020]  Now you've got the UN calling for a global digital currency, and everyone can join up
[3:41:59.020 --> 3:42:01.420]  and buy into this currency.
[3:42:01.420 --> 3:42:09.220]  No way, ladies and gentlemen, this is dangerous territory for the world.
[3:42:09.220 --> 3:42:11.020]  And they're using this.
[3:42:11.020 --> 3:42:13.740]  This will track everything you do.
[3:42:13.740 --> 3:42:19.380]  This will create a false economy that's based on you signing up and being chipped and being
[3:42:19.380 --> 3:42:24.380]  controlled and being manipulated because they'll be talking about identification being bad
[3:42:24.380 --> 3:42:25.980]  and they can't prove it to you.
[3:42:25.980 --> 3:42:32.540]  And you'll hear every manner of excuse for your own safety to strip away the last remnant
[3:42:32.540 --> 3:42:39.820]  of your humanity in the gulag, the electronic concentration camp that we're sitting in.
[3:42:39.820 --> 3:42:43.900]  And we've been boiled slowly like a frog in a pot.
[3:42:43.900 --> 3:42:46.060]  The world is changing, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:42:46.060 --> 3:42:47.060]  Be part of the change.
[3:42:47.060 --> 3:42:48.060]  Be the tip of the spear.
[3:42:48.060 --> 3:42:49.060]  This is Dr. Nick Kegelge.
[3:42:49.060 --> 3:42:58.420]  Something huge is happening all over the United States on ABC, CBS, NBC, on local Fox
[3:42:58.420 --> 3:42:59.420]  affiliates.
[3:42:59.420 --> 3:43:00.420]  But only local ones.
[3:43:00.420 --> 3:43:05.460]  They're having medical doctors on who successfully treated their patients with 100% recovery
[3:43:05.460 --> 3:43:09.980]  rates with hydroxychloroquine, but you've got to have the zinc.
[3:43:09.980 --> 3:43:15.460]  This is a known fact, but national news, other than Fox, will not carry it.
[3:43:15.460 --> 3:43:19.700]  And when Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingram, and Sean Hannity covered it and had medical doctors
[3:43:19.700 --> 3:43:23.460]  talk about it, they got demonized and Fox had them basically shut up.
[3:43:23.460 --> 3:43:24.940]  But they've been vindicated.
[3:43:24.940 --> 3:43:25.940]  Info wars has been vindicated.
[3:43:25.940 --> 3:43:31.460]  We were saying at first with experts we had on air, we got attacked nationally and they
[3:43:31.460 --> 3:43:36.080]  said, take us off the air, Google took our app away, saying that we were putting out
[3:43:36.080 --> 3:43:41.540]  fake cures for saying hydroxychloroquine, zinc and CPAC, but all we were doing was reporting
[3:43:41.540 --> 3:43:45.900]  with medical journals or saying big pharma and the globalist want you sick and dead
[3:43:45.900 --> 3:43:50.580]  and they don't want you to boost your immune system, screw them.
[3:43:50.580 --> 3:43:55.020]  I don't need to remind you how four years ago I told you the polls against Trump were
[3:43:55.020 --> 3:43:56.020]  fake.
[3:43:56.020 --> 3:44:00.820]  He was winning by a giant margin, but election fraud almost stole the election from Trump
[3:44:00.820 --> 3:44:01.820]  and the American people.
[3:44:01.820 --> 3:44:08.540]  Well, now they're pushing the idea that, oh, cancel the Republican and Democrat conventions,
[3:44:08.540 --> 3:44:12.380]  maybe cancel the election a year, like the Olympics.
[3:44:12.380 --> 3:44:18.220]  That's because they know Trump in every internal scientific poll is 20 points ahead of the
[3:44:18.220 --> 3:44:19.860]  brain damage by Biden.
[3:44:19.860 --> 3:44:24.820]  So they can say, sir, you look big like the Olympics, go back off a year and then you'll
[3:44:24.820 --> 3:44:27.540]  still win in a year after you fix the crisis now.
[3:44:27.540 --> 3:44:32.540]  They need more time to cook up an assassination, an economic collapse, a new virus.
[3:44:32.540 --> 3:44:36.900]  Trump needs to say, no, in America we keep elections on time, have the elections, win
[3:44:36.900 --> 3:44:40.420]  by a landslide and not give the globalists what they want.
[3:44:40.420 --> 3:44:44.900]  Hillary, Biden, they all want to suspend the election, we shouldn't give them what
[3:44:44.900 --> 3:44:45.900]  they want.
[3:44:45.900 --> 3:44:53.180]  We need to have a vote in America and reelect Trump 2020.
[3:44:53.180 --> 3:44:59.180]  Do yourself a favor and fund the info war at the same time, go to infowarstore.com and
[3:44:59.180 --> 3:45:03.860]  read about the ingredients, the highest quality like black walnut and others that are in this
[3:45:03.860 --> 3:45:06.540]  baby and then read some of those reviews to yourself.
[3:45:06.540 --> 3:45:10.780]  And then don't just believe info wars, go out online at major nutrition sites and others
[3:45:10.780 --> 3:45:13.140]  and look at the studies for yourself.
[3:45:13.140 --> 3:45:17.060]  Go out and engage in your First Amendment right to research and your First Amendment
[3:45:17.060 --> 3:45:21.420]  right to tell others about the incredible compounds God has given us through Mother
[3:45:21.420 --> 3:45:22.420]  Nature.
[3:45:22.420 --> 3:45:27.660]  Our defense is at infowarstore.com, sold out for four months, now back in stock for a limited
[3:45:27.660 --> 3:45:30.060]  time at 40% off.

[3:45:34.900 --> 3:45:38.900]  And we've got our great super blue toothpaste, the best seller for five years with the nano
[3:45:38.900 --> 3:45:40.940]  silver, the tea tree and the iodine.
[3:45:40.940 --> 3:45:46.060]  It's selling out still 50% off and the iodine's selling out, the X3, it's 60% off because
[3:45:46.060 --> 3:45:51.740]  I want you to experience how amazing it is.
[3:45:51.740 --> 3:45:58.700]  As predicted, the human rebellion against globalist machines has begun.
[3:45:58.700 --> 3:46:04.260]  The LA Times, The Washington Post, Wired Magazine all reported years ago that major studies
[3:46:04.260 --> 3:46:08.780]  show 5G caused increased cancer in rats.
[3:46:08.780 --> 3:46:09.780]  It's a fact.
[3:46:09.780 --> 3:46:15.340]  5G is just a later generation of systems that are on record for more than 70 years to cause
[3:46:15.340 --> 3:46:16.340]  cancer.
[3:46:16.340 --> 3:46:19.380]  They rub the DNA molecules together.
[3:46:19.380 --> 3:46:21.940]  They are microwaves.
[3:46:21.940 --> 3:46:27.460]  Well now, YouTube has admitted to the BBC and others that they're banning anyone criticizing
[3:46:27.460 --> 3:46:31.940]  5G, even if you don't connect it to coronavirus, they're banning it.
[3:46:31.940 --> 3:46:36.820]  But the studies do show that 5G lowers your immunity to viruses, period.
[3:46:36.820 --> 3:46:38.700]  They're peer reviewed journals.
[3:46:38.700 --> 3:46:42.580]  We're showing these documents on air and the globalists can go to hell.
[3:46:42.580 --> 3:46:45.900]  The human rebellion against globalist machines has begun.
[3:46:45.900 --> 3:46:48.100]  We're not traumatized afraid of technology.
[3:46:48.100 --> 3:46:54.860]  We don't like technology with Trojan Horse anti-human crap in it.
[3:46:54.860 --> 3:47:24.180]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:24.180 --> 3:47:25.180]  Welcome back.
[3:47:25.180 --> 3:47:31.300]  I appreciate everyone on this Friday afternoon and most of the world approaching the high
[3:47:31.300 --> 3:47:35.900]  noon hour here in Anchorage, Alaska, where I'm broadcasting today.
[3:47:35.900 --> 3:47:40.780]  I want to thank everyone too out there in Austin on the team that keeps all this going
[3:47:40.780 --> 3:47:44.100]  and makes us look good no matter where we are in the world.
[3:47:44.100 --> 3:47:49.180]  I appreciate those guys and you can help them too by stepping up and looking at info
[3:47:49.180 --> 3:47:54.820]  wars store dot com, take a look at that and support this network.
[3:47:54.820 --> 3:47:58.460]  You can look at my website, earthholst dot com, but there's nothing for sale there.
[3:47:58.460 --> 3:48:00.100]  I shut all that down.
[3:48:00.100 --> 3:48:05.020]  My books and videos are only available in hard copy through the info wars store.
[3:48:05.020 --> 3:48:06.380]  So go there, check it out.
[3:48:06.380 --> 3:48:09.020]  But if you want information, go to my website.
[3:48:09.020 --> 3:48:15.420]  There's a lot of free stuff there, earthholst dot com, E-A-R-T-H-B-U-L-S-E, earthholst dot
[3:48:15.420 --> 3:48:16.420]  com.
[3:48:16.420 --> 3:48:17.420]  A lot of information.
[3:48:17.420 --> 3:48:20.500]  And if there's stuff that I'm talking about, you want me to talk more about, send me an
[3:48:20.500 --> 3:48:25.140]  email at info at earthholst dot com and I'll give a good consideration.
[3:48:25.140 --> 3:48:29.420]  I want to switch up a little bit and try to get to what I was going to talk about today
[3:48:29.420 --> 3:48:31.380]  a little bit.
[3:48:31.380 --> 3:48:35.540]  I was going to talk about oil because it's a big thing in our state and our region that
[3:48:35.540 --> 3:48:39.220]  affects a lot of aspects of our economy.
[3:48:39.220 --> 3:48:44.100]  And we're hearing a lot about the Russians and Saudis coming to some agreement to reduce
[3:48:44.100 --> 3:48:48.700]  along with OPEC, OPEC plus, which includes those in our members, but participate in their
[3:48:48.700 --> 3:48:55.540]  meetings, reducing oil production by 10 million barrels a day, which is excited the market.
[3:48:55.540 --> 3:49:00.260]  Except for one thing, it's only a glass half full because the actual surplus on the world
[3:49:00.260 --> 3:49:04.180]  market is 20 million barrels a day, not 10.
[3:49:04.180 --> 3:49:09.300]  So whatever the mainstream is feeding you, again, it's fertilizer oil should take down
[3:49:09.300 --> 3:49:12.300]  additionally as the weeks go on.
[3:49:12.300 --> 3:49:16.220]  The other part of that is that's just dealing with the supply side.
[3:49:16.220 --> 3:49:22.740]  The demand slide is trickling down even further as more and more segments of global industry
[3:49:22.740 --> 3:49:23.740]  shuts down.
[3:49:23.740 --> 3:49:27.220]  So you have a supply side over supply.
[3:49:27.220 --> 3:49:31.980]  You have a on the production side, even with a 10 million barrel a day cut.
[3:49:31.980 --> 3:49:32.980]  It's not enough.
[3:49:32.980 --> 3:49:37.660]  It's not going to make the difference except in a very short perceptual time.
[3:49:37.660 --> 3:49:42.420]  And what I mean by that is, again, talking about emotion and how people react, people
[3:49:42.420 --> 3:49:47.300]  react, markets will react, and then the brain will kick back in and they will analyze the
[3:49:47.300 --> 3:49:52.580]  data and they will go, oh, bad idea, but the globalists already analyze the data.
[3:49:52.580 --> 3:49:56.820]  If you're watching CNN, Bloomberg, Fox News, you're too late.
[3:49:56.820 --> 3:50:01.660]  You're about a month too late or a year too late or 10 years too late in some cases, as
[3:50:01.660 --> 3:50:05.540]  those of us who look at the alternative news feeds know.
[3:50:05.540 --> 3:50:13.340]  So when you get the benefit of the Alex Jones and all of the guys that work here in terms
[3:50:13.340 --> 3:50:20.420]  of production, you get the benefit of hundreds and hundreds of hours of condensation to get
[3:50:20.420 --> 3:50:21.620]  information.
[3:50:21.620 --> 3:50:25.900]  And then we challenge everyone, of course, to go look it up, go verify the sources, go
[3:50:25.900 --> 3:50:27.420]  look it up.
[3:50:27.420 --> 3:50:30.140]  And if you've got a contrary in view, we want to hear it.
[3:50:30.140 --> 3:50:35.140]  If it's backed up by real information, not just some emotional litter thrown around
[3:50:35.140 --> 3:50:41.900]  like garbage on the side of your house, you know, this is junk, you know, you stick to
[3:50:41.900 --> 3:50:42.900]  what you know.
[3:50:42.900 --> 3:50:46.860]  You know, during the break, I was talking to one of the guys in the control we were
[3:50:46.860 --> 3:50:52.620]  talking about, you know, how does all this go, you know, and the effort is what's important.
[3:50:52.620 --> 3:50:55.740]  I talk about intention and effort and, you know, as human beings, we're going to make
[3:50:55.740 --> 3:50:57.940]  mistakes, we're going to screw it up.
[3:50:57.940 --> 3:51:01.980]  But if your intentions are good, even in the screw ups, if you learn from them and you
[3:51:01.980 --> 3:51:09.740]  change, you change your choices, the universe God uses anyway, makes it all work.
[3:51:09.740 --> 3:51:14.620]  If your intention is to do the right thing, and you do the wrong thing, fix it.
[3:51:14.620 --> 3:51:17.100]  Take responsibility, fix it and move on.
[3:51:17.100 --> 3:51:22.140]  You know, God doesn't burn you any more than you would, for your two-year-old making a
[3:51:22.140 --> 3:51:23.860]  mistake and fix it and move on.
[3:51:23.860 --> 3:51:26.660]  That's how God sees us, at least that's what I believe.
[3:51:26.660 --> 3:51:31.900]  Like we're the two-year-old and we are, I don't care how smart we are, we're the two-year-old.
[3:51:31.900 --> 3:51:37.060]  But our intention matters, our heart matters, and what we do matters, and every single step
[3:51:37.060 --> 3:51:39.260]  each of us take matters.
[3:51:39.260 --> 3:51:43.380]  You may be the one waving at the person across the street, as I started to say in the last
[3:51:43.380 --> 3:51:47.900]  segment, and that person maybe was on their way to blow their brains out, because they
[3:51:47.900 --> 3:51:48.900]  were so depressed.
[3:51:48.900 --> 3:51:54.900]  But you express some human emotion their way, connected to your intellect with an intention
[3:51:54.900 --> 3:52:01.780]  to say and mean it, hey, hello, I know you, you're a person.
[3:52:01.780 --> 3:52:05.420]  You know, that little thing that maybe diverted that person from killing themselves, and maybe
[3:52:05.420 --> 3:52:12.700]  that's the person that cures cancer, or does something really remarkable in life.
[3:52:12.700 --> 3:52:16.660]  And then who's more responsible, the guy who waved to Lowe, that diverted him from
[3:52:16.660 --> 3:52:19.620]  his path, or the one who made the cure?
[3:52:19.620 --> 3:52:25.500]  I say they were equal in the Creator's universe of God.
[3:52:25.500 --> 3:52:26.620]  They were equal.
[3:52:26.620 --> 3:52:32.220]  They acted on what they knew to be right and true within their capacity, within their faith
[3:52:32.220 --> 3:52:34.820]  of knowing, and they did something.
[3:52:34.820 --> 3:52:36.460]  We all get to do that.
[3:52:36.460 --> 3:52:41.580]  And what ripple in the pond we create, we do not know, and we will not know, until we
[3:52:41.580 --> 3:52:43.980]  make the leap to the other side.
[3:52:43.980 --> 3:52:48.820]  And then we'll get the picture, maybe, and you'll find out what you did, that you didn't
[3:52:48.820 --> 3:52:54.460]  even know you did, because you held that intention, you held your heart clean, you tried, you
[3:52:54.460 --> 3:52:58.260]  made up, you corrected, you self-corrected, you self-navigated.
[3:52:58.260 --> 3:53:03.060]  Your traumas you converted into the gold, into the scar tissue, the things that armored
[3:53:03.060 --> 3:53:05.380]  you for the next steps in life.
[3:53:05.380 --> 3:53:11.580]  This is what it all boils down to, is it's the armoring of who we are.
[3:53:11.580 --> 3:53:17.420]  And I was talking to the guys in the control room helping us today, you know, and I was
[3:53:17.420 --> 3:53:21.740]  talking about this in the context of, you know, it all looks so chaotic, right?
[3:53:21.740 --> 3:53:26.180]  I mean, we look at it all, and then we see chaos, it's just craziness.
[3:53:26.180 --> 3:53:32.060]  But if you can step back far enough, in science, we'll teach you about fractals, these things
[3:53:32.060 --> 3:53:36.180]  that actually show pattern, that out of chaos.
[3:53:36.180 --> 3:53:40.700]  You know, if you get far enough back, you can see the whole pattern.
[3:53:40.700 --> 3:53:43.540]  I believe God sees the whole pattern.
[3:53:43.540 --> 3:53:45.580]  Think about that.
[3:53:45.580 --> 3:53:52.620]  So we see a bit, or we're lost in the fractal, or what we think is a hurricane, and we get
[3:53:52.620 --> 3:53:54.220]  lost in it.
[3:53:54.220 --> 3:54:01.060]  Center of the storm, you know, this is where the creation intends us to be, is in the center
[3:54:01.060 --> 3:54:04.620]  of the storm as part of the creation process.
[3:54:04.620 --> 3:54:12.780]  All of us, not some of us, shoved off to be drones being replaced by robots.
[3:54:12.780 --> 3:54:21.060]  The single living soul has equal potential, potential.
[3:54:21.060 --> 3:54:23.380]  This is a big thing we talk a lot about in four words.
[3:54:23.380 --> 3:54:25.980]  All the hosts talk about potential.
[3:54:25.980 --> 3:54:27.460]  What can we do?
[3:54:27.460 --> 3:54:33.620]  You can do that, which you believe you can do, and step into it, and no, that's fake.
[3:54:33.620 --> 3:54:38.060]  And then you can hope for a bigger thing down the road, that's hope.
[3:54:38.060 --> 3:54:40.460]  Start to think about the word symbols.
[3:54:40.460 --> 3:54:42.980]  Start to think about what you're hearing.
[3:54:42.980 --> 3:54:49.380]  And then start to think about how does that resonate, connect with you on the intention
[3:54:49.380 --> 3:54:50.380]  level.
[3:54:50.380 --> 3:54:51.380]  Do you feel it?
[3:54:51.380 --> 3:54:52.380]  Do you know it?
[3:54:52.380 --> 3:54:53.380]  That's called discernment.
[3:54:53.380 --> 3:54:54.380]  Start to use it.
[3:54:54.380 --> 3:54:57.260]  Use your discernment in analyzing the words.
[3:54:57.260 --> 3:55:00.140]  Are they moving you emotionally, hurting you along?
[3:55:00.140 --> 3:55:01.540]  Are they challenging your intellect?
[3:55:01.540 --> 3:55:07.820]  Are they bringing the intellect and the emotion together into one form that changes you and
[3:55:07.820 --> 3:55:10.220]  then changes those around you?
[3:55:10.220 --> 3:55:13.380]  And then changes the world, because that's the answer.
[3:55:13.380 --> 3:55:17.460]  It's not the herd mentality, it's individual sovereignty.
[3:55:17.460 --> 3:55:21.700]  This is the opposite, you see, ladies and gentlemen, of what globalists are trying to
[3:55:21.700 --> 3:55:28.180]  drive us into, into this sense of squishy collectivism, where group think dominates everything.
[3:55:28.180 --> 3:55:31.100]  Nobody will make a decision without a committee action.
[3:55:31.100 --> 3:55:33.220]  This is not what we are.
[3:55:33.220 --> 3:55:36.540]  We act on what we believe to be right and true.
[3:55:36.540 --> 3:55:44.540]  We act in the spirit of creation of God, of what we understand God to be, accept people
[3:55:44.540 --> 3:55:50.780]  where they are, think of what Christ did in his life, met people where they were, didn't
[3:55:50.780 --> 3:55:53.140]  judge them at that moment at all.
[3:55:53.140 --> 3:55:55.500]  That was for another day.
[3:55:55.500 --> 3:56:01.660]  Meet people where they are, recognize that people don't come to their realities randomly.
[3:56:01.660 --> 3:56:07.500]  They do it by combining either their intellect or their emotion and talk, communicate, reach
[3:56:07.500 --> 3:56:12.580]  into each other and listen carefully to what constructs someone else's thought.
[3:56:12.580 --> 3:56:16.140]  And then that will help you understand them as a human being and perhaps change the way
[3:56:16.140 --> 3:56:21.500]  you think or perhaps you'll discover the missing links in the conversation where you can then
[3:56:21.500 --> 3:56:24.500]  inform and educate each other.
[3:56:24.500 --> 3:56:29.980]  This is the change that I'm hoping for that comes out of this trauma that we're experiencing
[3:56:29.980 --> 3:56:34.700]  together in this day, in this age, in this century.
[3:56:34.700 --> 3:56:42.020]  What I hope reshifts us sets a new foundation in North as we battle what I call clearly
[3:56:42.020 --> 3:56:47.460]  that consciousness of the Antichrist, of that that destroys, that takes, that sucks the
[3:56:47.460 --> 3:56:50.620]  humanity out of each of us.
[3:56:50.620 --> 3:56:54.340]  It's time to recognize that we are not that.
[3:56:54.340 --> 3:56:58.460]  It is time to recognize that these things, these tools that are being misused against
[3:56:58.460 --> 3:57:01.780]  us need to be reclaimed in this century.
[3:57:01.780 --> 3:57:05.500]  They need to be reorienting the cameras turned into a different direction.
[3:57:05.500 --> 3:57:09.980]  They need to be turned into the banks, into the governments, into the think tanks that
[3:57:09.980 --> 3:57:15.300]  would like to direct and tell us how to live, that take away our individuality, that take
[3:57:15.300 --> 3:57:18.740]  away the essence of what we are as created souls.
[3:57:18.740 --> 3:57:24.740]  It's time to reclaim our birthright as living, created beings, express our intention in the
[3:57:24.740 --> 3:57:26.940]  world and change the world.
[3:57:26.940 --> 3:57:32.980]  Change ourselves, change those around us by informing, not dominant, not controlled, not
[3:57:32.980 --> 3:57:34.580]  manipulated.
[3:57:34.580 --> 3:57:59.860]  This is the info war and you are the tip of the spear.
