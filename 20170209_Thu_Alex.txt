[00:00:01.826 --> 00:00:05.791]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's already Thursday, the 9th day of February 2017.
[00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:09.856]  Senator Sessions has been confirmed to be the Attorney General.
[00:00:09.856 --> 00:00:13.240]  The globalists are certainly scared right now.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.226]  But John Bowne's got a special report on how they're upping the race war card to the next level.
[00:00:19.656 --> 00:00:27.017]  Former Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions will now be addressed as Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
[00:00:27.017 --> 00:00:40.420]  Last night's vote of confirmation finally tallied after the Democrats waged a marathon of shallow character assassinations on the integrity of Jeff Sessions' candidacy as the most powerful lawyer in the land.
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:48.381]  Senator Sessions' voting, views on voting rights and in mind and understanding how he responded to the President's
[00:00:49.352 --> 00:01:07.398]  Claims is important to helping us assess whether he is capable of filling one of the Attorney General's most important duties, protecting the right to vote.
[00:01:07.398 --> 00:01:11.459]  I start my remarks tonight aggrieved by what I saw happen to Elizabeth Warren.
[00:01:19.304 --> 00:01:28.607]  Of course, Senator Elizabeth Warren had been silenced as she violated protocol whilst playing the Democrats' weapon of choice, the race card.
[00:01:28.607 --> 00:01:42.191]  And the senator played a key role in shaping what has become the most extreme, most divisive, and most dangerous immigration policies of any president in decades.
[00:01:43.524 --> 00:01:48.527]  Senator Sessions' radical views are not limited to immigration.
[00:01:48.527 --> 00:01:59.515]  On issue after issue after issue, Senator Sessions has displayed open hostility to the rights of all Americans.
[00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:06.359]  He has made derogatory and racist comments that should have no place in our justice system.
[00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.820]  Mr. President.
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.421]  They are- Majority Leader.
[00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:09.281]  Mr. President.
[00:02:09.281 --> 00:02:09.902]  The Majority Leader.
[00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:16.874]  The Senator is impugning the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama, as warned by the Chair.
[00:02:16.874 --> 00:02:27.283]  Senator Warren, quote, said Senator Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens.
[00:02:27.283 --> 00:02:29.725]  I call the Senator to order under the provisions of Rule 19.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:50.210]  CNN came to her aid, claiming the Senate has silenced Elizabeth Warren, and by doing so, majority Republicans just handed the liberal firebrand a megaphone, further elevating President Donald Trump's fiercest and most prominent critic in the Senate, and turning her into a Democratic hero.
[00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.032]  When the smoke and mirrors had cleared, the truth was to be told.
[00:02:54.032 --> 00:03:00.195]  Warren had managed to play the race card so obviously in the name of civil rights leader Coretta Scott King,
[00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:12.553]  Senator Sessions, it's a great honor and privilege for me to join you in celebrating the grand opening of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum.
[00:03:12.553 --> 00:03:18.756]  MLK's niece responded saying, if we take a look at my Aunt Coretta Scott King's
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.000]  I think?
[00:03:48.158 --> 00:03:58.193]  Attorney General Jeff Sessions may not have the support of the Democrats, but he does have the support of the voters who wish to see the swamp drained in Washington D.C.
[00:03:58.193 --> 00:04:01.357]  A recently retired 25-year veteran of the U.S.
[00:04:01.357 --> 00:04:04.462]  Department of State had this to say about Jeff Sessions.
[00:04:04.702 --> 00:04:10.744]  I fully support President Donald Trump's executive order that temporarily halts admissions from the U.S.
[00:04:10.744 --> 00:04:19.047]  Refugee Admissions Program and bans travel from nationals of countries that potentially pose a security risk to the United States.
[00:04:19.047 --> 00:04:22.328]  However, I don't think the action goes far enough.
[00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:32.351]  I have seen firsthand the abuses and fraud that permeate the refugee program and know about the entrenched interests that fight every effort to implement much-needed reform.
[00:04:32.631 --> 00:04:36.992]  Quoted from a letter published in the Chicago Tribune from recently retired U.S.
[00:04:36.992 --> 00:04:39.132]  State Department veteran Mary Doach.
[00:04:39.132 --> 00:04:43.753]  It is time to put away childish race-baiting tactics, liberals.
[00:04:43.753 --> 00:04:51.034]  The United States is going to get on with the business of protecting its interest in national security with or without you.
[00:04:51.034 --> 00:04:56.656]  Denigrating people who disagree with us I think is not a healthy trend for our body.
[00:04:56.656 --> 00:04:58.616]  John Bound for Infowars.com
[00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:05.387]  Radiation in Fukushima has reached unprecedented levels.
[00:05:05.387 --> 00:05:11.808]  News has been breaking for days now that radiation levels inside the damaged nuclear reactor are at their highest point since the meltdown in 2011.
[00:05:11.808 --> 00:05:23.711]  Tokyo Electric Power, or TEPCO, has said that readings as high as 530 sieverts an hour have been recorded inside of nuclear reactor number two, one of the three failing reactors, that's 100 times the fatal level.
[00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:29.536]  This increase is quite alarming, considering the previous high was 73 Sieverts an hour, a 700% increase.
[00:05:29.536 --> 00:05:34.860]  The hypothesis for the increased levels at this point is that nuclear fuel melted a hole through a containment vessel.
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:43.047]  These increased levels of radiation will make cleanup even more difficult, considering the most advanced robot for the assignment can only last two hours in the atmosphere before failing.
[00:05:43.047 --> 00:05:49.152]  Estimated cost of cleanup, if possible, is said to have doubled, but let's be honest, the cost of this is immeasurable.
[00:05:49.372 --> 00:05:52.980]  This meltdown has already severely crippled marine life in the Pacific Ocean.
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.167]  The protesters and the mainstream news are still silent on this issue.
[00:05:56.167 --> 00:05:58.592]  This is Owen Schroyer for InfoWars.com.
[00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:06.331]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.310]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:09.212]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[00:07:09.212 --> 00:07:11.752]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[00:07:11.752 --> 00:07:17.554]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[00:07:17.554 --> 00:07:23.255]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[00:07:23.695 --> 00:07:26.658]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[00:07:26.658 --> 00:07:32.224]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[00:07:32.224 --> 00:07:39.251]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[00:07:39.251 --> 00:07:43.816]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[00:07:44.076 --> 00:07:47.377]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[00:07:47.377 --> 00:07:49.458]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[00:07:49.458 --> 00:07:55.180]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.621]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[00:07:57.621 --> 00:07:59.302]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[00:08:04.011 --> 00:08:06.913]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:08:06.913 --> 00:08:07.414]  I'm sick.
[00:08:07.414 --> 00:08:07.994]  Just let me sick.
[00:08:07.994 --> 00:08:13.579]  In fact, even now, orders are being shouts into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:08:13.579 --> 00:08:14.920]  It's Chancellor Sattler.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.620]  Damn it!
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.661]  Why?
[00:08:16.661 --> 00:08:23.266]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:08:23.266 --> 00:08:26.429]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[00:08:29.195 --> 00:08:34.039]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:35.079]  You designed it, sir.
[00:08:35.079 --> 00:08:36.020]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.661]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:41.564]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[00:08:41.564 --> 00:08:52.411]  And where once you had the freedom to object and to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and surveilling your submissiveness.
[00:08:52.411 --> 00:08:53.852]  How did this happen?
[00:08:53.852 --> 00:08:54.613]  Who's to blame?
[00:08:55.613 --> 00:08:58.256]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:08:58.256 --> 00:09:00.177]  They will be held accountable.
[00:09:00.177 --> 00:09:06.063]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:09:07.262 --> 00:09:09.243]  I know why you did it.
[00:09:09.243 --> 00:09:10.743]  I know you were afraid.
[00:09:10.743 --> 00:09:12.464]  Who would it be?
[00:09:12.464 --> 00:09:12.744]  War?
[00:09:12.744 --> 00:09:13.384]  Terror?
[00:09:13.384 --> 00:09:14.665]  Disease?
[00:09:14.665 --> 00:09:21.107]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:09:21.107 --> 00:09:27.350]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:33.632]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:09:40.405 --> 00:09:42.087]  There is a war.
[00:09:42.087 --> 00:09:43.948]  It's happening now.
[00:09:43.948 --> 00:09:46.310]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.913]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:09:48.913 --> 00:09:50.794]  We are the resistance.
[00:09:50.794 --> 00:09:53.957]  We are the Infowar.
[00:09:53.957 --> 00:09:58.121]  And here we are on this live Thursday, the ninth day of February 2017.
[00:09:58.121 --> 00:10:02.605]  Going to be broadcasting worldwide here for the next four hours.
[00:10:02.605 --> 00:10:04.526]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:10:05.857 --> 00:10:21.011]  I have been made aware of quite a bit of information concerning White House intrigue that's going on in the last few months, even before President Trump actually got sworn in 18, 19 days ago.
[00:10:21.011 --> 00:10:26.436]  And since then, I have confirmed it with several other sources.
[00:10:26.436 --> 00:10:31.221]  And time and time again, I sit on news and information I'm given.
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:39.243]  Because I've been told by sources don't go with it yet.
[00:10:39.243 --> 00:10:42.505]  But also because, well, it'll, quote, hurt me.
[00:10:42.505 --> 00:10:50.750]  Well, I don't care what happens to Alex Jones at the end of the day when it comes down to this republic and the future of this country.
[00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:57.734]  I'll just tell you this, and I'm going to have to break this soon because it's too dangerous, too dangerous to have this information and not go with it.
[00:10:57.734 --> 00:11:01.076]  I'm kind of making the decision right now.
[00:11:02.432 --> 00:11:13.215]  There's a lot of evidence pointing towards leakers.
[00:11:13.215 --> 00:11:14.915]  And it's just amazing.
[00:11:14.915 --> 00:11:22.457]  Not just Democratic or globalist leakers inside the Pentagon, inside the CIA, but people even closer to President Trump.
[00:11:24.472 --> 00:11:47.004]  Leaking information and leaking the target list so that Al Qaeda knew that that raid was coming a week and a half ago so that they could be waiting and cause larger casualties just like the CIA reportedly leaked information to Fidel Castro during the raid to begin the failed invasion known as the Bay of Pigs in the early 1960s.
[00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:55.772]  So there's definitely a lot of dirty tricks going on to undermine this republic.
[00:11:55.772 --> 00:12:15.548]  I put some feelers out to military sources, folks in DC, folks in Southern California, and folks that are in Africa right now, and they just said that definitely folks were waiting.
[00:12:15.548 --> 00:12:19.732]  So it was just basically a setup, and that's just part of it.
[00:12:23.154 --> 00:12:40.005]  Now, if you know what incredible backstabbers the Republican Party leadership was against Trump, and how they were funded, the top six Republicans, by George Soros, who's one of their biggest contributors, and if you realize that the leaks are just spilling out from the very top of the White House.
[00:12:40.005 --> 00:12:50.473]  They're not coming from Jeff Sessions, they're not coming from Rex Tillerson, it's not coming from Stephen Bannon.
[00:12:50.473 --> 00:12:52.414]  And very soon, I'm going to be able to give you more details, but
[00:12:54.201 --> 00:12:59.123]  Some people in that administration are not long for this world.
[00:12:59.123 --> 00:13:05.285]  And I don't mean physically, I mean politically.
[00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:10.847]  But you think about the type of trash that's Paul Ryan.
[00:13:10.847 --> 00:13:13.407]  The type of trash that is Lindsey Graham.
[00:13:13.407 --> 00:13:16.649]  The type of trash that is John McCain.
[00:13:16.649 --> 00:13:19.770]  And their cohort, Mitch McConnell.
[00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.330]  Truly disgusting.
[00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:23.551]  Truly disgusting.
[00:13:24.758 --> 00:13:27.860]  Well, Senator Sessions is now Attorney General Sessions.
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.162]  A very honorable man.
[00:13:30.162 --> 00:13:32.404]  Got the daughter of Martin Luther King coming out and endorsing him.
[00:13:32.404 --> 00:13:34.306]  So much more happening.
[00:13:34.306 --> 00:13:36.848]  The MSM is going into race-baiting overdrive.
[00:13:36.848 --> 00:13:40.110]  It is simply incredible.
[00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.171]  But you've got other good news.
[00:13:41.171 --> 00:13:44.373]  Americans find Trump more trustworthy than the media in major poll.
[00:13:44.373 --> 00:13:47.556]  Paul Joseph Watson in fullwars.com story.
[00:13:47.556 --> 00:13:50.979]  Trump releases list of two dozen terror suspects allowed to
[00:13:52.202 --> 00:14:01.847]  Enter the United States from behind banned countries to countermand the lie of one of the judges that's out there attacking Trump.
[00:14:01.847 --> 00:14:13.593]  Then when Trump responds back, even his new attorney, even his new Supreme Court nominee doesn't back the president and says, well, he doesn't like it when the judiciary is attacked.
[00:14:13.593 --> 00:14:17.195]  Well, the judiciary is not supposed to be political, running around trying to undermine the country.
[00:14:20.933 --> 00:14:22.674]  So there's a lot coming up on that front today.
[00:14:22.674 --> 00:14:25.554]  Bill Kristol has come out.
[00:14:51.823 --> 00:14:58.207]  And the head Trotskyite that's basically been running the Republican Party for at least 40 years.
[00:14:58.207 --> 00:14:59.068]  That's right.
[00:14:59.068 --> 00:15:07.334]  Leon Trotsky ran out of Stalinist Russia, came to Mexico, got killed with an ice axe in Mexico City.
[00:15:07.334 --> 00:15:10.816]  The rest of them fled up here, took over Chicago Business School.
[00:15:10.816 --> 00:15:16.340]  I mean, how can you make that up?
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.161]  You can't make that up.
[00:15:17.161 --> 00:15:18.081]  That's mainline history.
[00:15:18.081 --> 00:15:20.203]  That's Wall Street Journal, New York Times, folks.
[00:15:21.812 --> 00:15:32.424]  And now are saying that white working class should be replaced by immigrants and that whites are inherently lazy and stupid and bad.
[00:15:32.424 --> 00:15:40.712]  Well, no, you can say third, fourth, fifth generation Americans, whether they're Hispanic, black or white, tend to be more lazy because we've grown up in a land of milk and honey.
[00:15:40.712 --> 00:15:42.194]  I'm lazier than my dad was.
[00:15:42.194 --> 00:15:43.696]  My kids are probably a little bit more lazy than
[00:15:45.097 --> 00:15:45.537]  I was.
[00:15:45.537 --> 00:15:48.338]  I mean, it's just the nature of the TV, the culture.
[00:15:48.338 --> 00:15:49.059]  Everybody knows that.
[00:15:49.059 --> 00:15:50.619]  It's not because they're white.
[00:15:50.619 --> 00:15:54.081]  Imagine if you said, the black people need to be replaced because they're lazy.
[00:15:54.081 --> 00:15:55.402]  What?
[00:15:55.402 --> 00:15:59.823]  This is the most hardcore, classic racism.
[00:15:59.823 --> 00:16:01.604]  The 200 proof stuff.
[00:16:01.604 --> 00:16:03.225]  The 110% stuff.
[00:16:03.225 --> 00:16:06.126]  The all the way over the top stuff.
[00:16:06.126 --> 00:16:13.890]  But if you look at the world and you look at 7% of the world being white, that's what a lot of folks identifying for being white who really aren't.
[00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:14.390]  Classically.
[00:16:16.221 --> 00:16:20.443]  And so the globals look at the numbers and people are people.
[00:16:20.443 --> 00:16:24.605]  You could teach a black person, Hispanic person, Asian to be totally racist.
[00:16:24.605 --> 00:16:27.206]  That China is super racist, that's well known.
[00:16:27.206 --> 00:16:36.229]  Or just xenophobic, insular, homogenous, non-homogenous.
[00:16:36.229 --> 00:16:37.490]  The point is that
[00:16:39.246 --> 00:16:40.067]  That's the strategy.
[00:16:40.067 --> 00:16:49.741]  The globalists are going to flood the West with third world populations and train them to be basically the equivalent of brown Nazis, but anti-white.
[00:16:49.741 --> 00:16:50.802]  It's a total reversal.
[00:16:52.076 --> 00:16:55.938]  You study British intelligence and others putting Hitler in power and that whole plan.
[00:16:55.938 --> 00:16:59.159]  It's just the same thing using race to control people over and over again.
[00:16:59.159 --> 00:17:01.000]  It's just so incredible.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:08.924]  And you're seeing desperate attempts now to try to fuse everybody together in a melting pot, a common culture by Trump and good people in our government.
[00:17:08.924 --> 00:17:16.247]  That's why I've suddenly gone from opposing the government to supporting it because it's suddenly trying to have a good aim, a constitutional direction.
[00:17:16.247 --> 00:17:17.207]  It's clear as day.
[00:17:17.207 --> 00:17:18.648]  The whole global government's against Trump.
[00:17:20.526 --> 00:17:30.309]  And remember, Sally Brown, running for the DNC, top Democrat, saying, I will oppress the whites, I'll keep them down, I'll make sure you get the privilege, and they don't.
[00:17:30.309 --> 00:17:31.109]  What?
[00:17:31.109 --> 00:17:34.190]  Like you get some privilege.
[00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:41.592]  Let me tell you something, you go to a country club, and you're not from around there, I don't care if you're white or brown or who you are, they're not gonna like you.
[00:17:41.592 --> 00:17:47.094]  But you go to most of the country clubs, and you're some elite golfer, I don't care what color you are, they're gonna be worshiping at your feet.
[00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:59.573]  But again, they just hype this and hype this like it's the only thing in the world, so everybody has chips on their shoulders, and then you go to college to become a mental patient and just be totally upset in a basket case.
[00:17:59.573 --> 00:18:05.095]  There's a powerful article on InfoWars.com by John Rappaport, the number one mind control program at U.S.
[00:18:05.095 --> 00:18:08.156]  colleges, the unspoken secret in plain sight.
[00:18:08.156 --> 00:18:11.377]  If you're a college student or have a child in college, read this.
[00:18:11.377 --> 00:18:15.898]  It's a 12-page incredible report that is dead on.
[00:18:15.898 --> 00:18:18.639]  He's hosting the fourth hour today, and I hope he's covering that.
[00:18:19.758 --> 00:18:21.938]  I don't tell folks really what to cover when they guest host.
[00:18:21.938 --> 00:18:23.179]  I just respect them.
[00:18:23.179 --> 00:18:26.600]  I want them to be able to host an hour or so a week of the fourth hour.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:32.141]  But I mean, I hope Rob Port's covering this in detail today because it is super important.
[00:18:32.141 --> 00:18:33.221]  I'm not against college.
[00:18:33.221 --> 00:18:36.022]  I'm against what it's been hijacked and turned into.
[00:18:36.022 --> 00:18:37.262]  I'm not against vaccines.
[00:18:37.262 --> 00:18:45.404]  I'm against them being used as Trojan horse piggyback programs and secret projects that have been declassified.
[00:18:45.404 --> 00:18:46.404]  It's the same story.
[00:18:47.878 --> 00:18:52.822]  Not against smartphones, except they got a bunch of back-door Trojan horse garbage.
[00:18:52.822 --> 00:18:53.562]  It's the same deal.
[00:18:53.562 --> 00:18:59.467]  I'm going to skip this break so I have more time.
[00:18:59.467 --> 00:19:14.017]  So, white working-class people replaced by immigrants, and then you've got Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters in a press conference, in the same press conference, thinking Bush is still in office after he's out of office eight years and change.
[00:19:14.017 --> 00:19:14.458]  You've got
[00:19:16.832 --> 00:19:19.594]  Water's thinking that Putin invaded Korea.
[00:19:19.594 --> 00:19:21.935]  Doesn't even say North or South.
[00:19:21.935 --> 00:19:25.297]  I mean, it's just total cuckoo land.
[00:19:25.297 --> 00:19:26.878]  And that's who's running things.
[00:19:26.878 --> 00:19:30.241]  People that think islands are floating.
[00:19:30.241 --> 00:19:31.381]  Yeah, put a sail on them.
[00:19:31.381 --> 00:19:34.023]  Did you hear Hawaii crashed into California last year?
[00:19:34.023 --> 00:19:35.624]  It was floating around out there.
[00:19:35.624 --> 00:19:37.625]  It's not floating.
[00:19:37.625 --> 00:19:40.147]  It's an underwater mountain with the tip sticking out.
[00:19:44.133 --> 00:19:46.714]  I can't believe you have to explain this to people.
[00:19:46.714 --> 00:19:49.354]  He said, oh well that's just some idiot on the street.
[00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:51.495]  You know, Mark Dice goes and finds morons.
[00:19:51.495 --> 00:19:51.835]  No he doesn't.
[00:19:51.835 --> 00:19:57.517]  He'll go interview 20 people and 19 of them say put gun owners in forced labor camps.
[00:19:57.517 --> 00:19:59.957]  That's who those Californians are.
[00:19:59.957 --> 00:20:03.238]  We do it in Austin, it's 9 out of 10.
[00:20:03.238 --> 00:20:08.139]  Still frighteningly dumb, frighteningly evil, frighteningly authoritarian.
[00:20:08.139 --> 00:20:09.420]  They're ready to do whatever.
[00:20:10.262 --> 00:20:13.943]  If the state says do it, because that's how they're in, that's how they're trendies.
[00:20:13.943 --> 00:20:22.145]  They've submitted their will over to the system that's out to destroy them.
[00:20:22.145 --> 00:20:28.947]  He goes out and says, let's have reparations where all whites pay up white privilege tax, and white people, black people, you name it, go, you bet, we're all for it.
[00:20:32.745 --> 00:20:34.026]  These aren't just dumb people on the street.
[00:20:34.026 --> 00:20:35.808]  This is Nancy Pelosi.
[00:20:35.808 --> 00:20:37.009]  This is Maxine Waters.
[00:20:37.009 --> 00:20:40.752]  In the same five minutes, they don't know what planet they're on.
[00:20:40.752 --> 00:20:42.354]  I was watching other press conferences of theirs.
[00:20:42.354 --> 00:20:43.275]  I went back last night.
[00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:44.516]  Spent about an hour.
[00:20:44.516 --> 00:20:46.257]  And they're just, what's this?
[00:20:46.257 --> 00:20:48.279]  Uh, uh, to the microphone.
[00:20:48.279 --> 00:20:50.601]  They don't know what they're doing.
[00:20:50.601 --> 00:20:54.305]  They can't find their big fat rear ends with both of their criminal paws.
[00:20:57.588 --> 00:21:06.515]  But they've been put there because they're ready to do absolutely unpopular criminal things, in my view.
[00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:08.296]  So let's hear from Bill Kristol.
[00:21:08.296 --> 00:21:09.817]  I mean, an arrogant.
[00:21:09.817 --> 00:21:14.281]  He just sits there with total arrogance, with his chin up in the sky like he's a god.
[00:21:15.746 --> 00:21:22.351]  And he's just, his shoulders drooping, just the body language is just complete mental illness.
[00:21:22.351 --> 00:21:24.372]  Complete megalomania.
[00:21:24.372 --> 00:21:24.873]  But you know what?
[00:21:24.873 --> 00:21:26.554]  He should be megalomania.
[00:21:26.554 --> 00:21:35.541]  His family came here after running from Stalin and took over the Republican Party and has gutted the entire nation and almost wrecked it.
[00:21:35.541 --> 00:21:38.202]  So just, it's good to screw America over.
[00:21:38.202 --> 00:21:42.225]  It's good to be a big fat parasite.
[00:21:42.225 --> 00:21:42.606]  And so,
[00:21:44.127 --> 00:21:46.129]  He works with the Democrats to screw America over.
[00:21:46.129 --> 00:21:51.494]  He works with Paul Ryan, all the other Soros minions, and he thinks you're stupid.
[00:21:51.494 --> 00:21:53.836]  He thinks you're an idiot.
[00:21:53.836 --> 00:21:58.340]  And he says the problem is the white working class should be replaced.
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.963]  People figure this out yet, but let me give all the minorities a little newsflash.
[00:22:01.963 --> 00:22:03.204]  You're the majority.
[00:22:03.204 --> 00:22:06.167]  If you bring down America, you burn up your own life raft.
[00:22:06.167 --> 00:22:07.888]  You blow up your own birthright.
[00:22:07.888 --> 00:22:09.430]  You're complete idiots if you do that.
[00:22:12.782 --> 00:22:14.624]  People are like, oh really, you're going to get it now, Whitey?
[00:22:14.624 --> 00:22:17.007]  I'm like, nothing's going to happen to me, let me explain what's going to happen.
[00:22:17.007 --> 00:22:27.219]  You're going to be used to drive down all the wages, you're going to live in a big police state, and then you're going to be totally exploited to make sure there's no ladder out of this for anybody.
[00:22:27.219 --> 00:22:30.864]  And people like Crystal is going to sit there and laugh at all of us like we're stupid.
[00:22:32.366 --> 00:22:39.593]  Just like Gruber said, thank God the Americans are so dumb and don't pay attention and have no attention spans, because we're going to double and triple their prices.
[00:22:39.593 --> 00:22:46.699]  And he's up there on C-SPAN with a bunch of other professors and statisticians giggling and smirking and laughing.
[00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:52.164]  It's like a ruling class of uncool, jerk, nerd, slash serial killer types.
[00:22:53.516 --> 00:22:57.038]  Most serial killers don't look like a pocket protector nerd.
[00:22:57.038 --> 00:22:58.758]  And they're just out to get everybody.
[00:22:58.758 --> 00:23:00.239]  They're hyper-aggressive.
[00:23:00.239 --> 00:23:01.700]  They want to be dominant.
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.920]  And they've been given an open, free society.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.761]  And they take that as an excuse.
[00:23:05.761 --> 00:23:10.623]  They take our kindness as real alpha males as weakness.
[00:23:10.623 --> 00:23:15.405]  And they run completely and out of control with it.
[00:23:15.405 --> 00:23:16.986]  And they tell you you're stupid.
[00:23:16.986 --> 00:23:21.308]  Then they'll get a bunch of beta-compliant women and hype them all up.
[00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:26.874]  To run around hen-pecking everywhere in an aggressive display to bring down the civilization.
[00:23:26.874 --> 00:23:31.858]  It's crazy.
[00:23:31.858 --> 00:23:34.460]  But you can see the plan, you can see the numbers.
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:42.647]  Open the borders, bring in unlimited third-world populations, they can out-vote, out-riot, out-drive down wages, anybody, and then it's boom.
[00:23:42.647 --> 00:23:45.529]  Balkanized society, you've broken the free society, it's over.
[00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:49.693]  I'm going to get to that clip in a moment, but meanwhile, how beautiful is this?
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:24:02.545]  Matt Grudge fires up the bat beam last night from wherever he's at up into the night sky to Trump and says the Republican Party ought to be sued for fraud.
[00:24:02.545 --> 00:24:03.406]  It's a joke.
[00:24:03.406 --> 00:24:05.847]  I want to see tax cuts right now.
[00:24:05.847 --> 00:24:07.107]  Trump promised it.
[00:24:07.107 --> 00:24:12.269]  I don't want to see, you know, sanctions on countries that are getting rare earth minerals or whatever.
[00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:14.510]  I don't want to see a bunch of UN style stuff.
[00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:18.112]  I want to see action and I want to see it now.
[00:24:18.112 --> 00:24:19.573]  And what happened a couple hours later?
[00:24:20.475 --> 00:24:23.717]  Well, Batman saw it.
[00:24:23.717 --> 00:24:25.178]  What do you think Drudge is doing at night?
[00:24:25.178 --> 00:24:27.760]  He's reading Drudge, he's reading Infowars, he's watching our videos.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.642]  I can just tell you that point blank right for the man himself.
[00:24:30.642 --> 00:24:31.963]  Trump to Drudge!
[00:24:31.963 --> 00:24:38.208]  Phenomenal tax cut package, coming in two to three weeks.
[00:24:38.208 --> 00:24:42.471]  Now, in fairness to Trump, and not disagreeing with Drudge,
[00:24:47.686 --> 00:24:52.110]  Saying that they're going to cut two-thirds of the regulations and signing an executive order is the same thing as a tax cut.
[00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:57.975]  I mean, it is, because it's just the money gets passed on to the employees, the owners, it creates productivity, hiring.
[00:24:57.975 --> 00:25:08.604]  But in a purest sense, the Republican leadership is trying to send it to 2018 after they, quote, get rid of Obamacare, after they, quote, you know, get rid of this stuff, then they're going to do it.
[00:25:08.604 --> 00:25:09.745]  That's what they always do.
[00:25:09.745 --> 00:25:11.867]  They always move the can down the road.
[00:25:11.867 --> 00:25:13.228]  They're trying to give Trump cover.
[00:25:13.228 --> 00:25:13.889]  He doesn't want cover.
[00:25:14.946 --> 00:25:22.007]  It's like Gingrich before he got kicked out of the, uh, you know, entourage, said, oh, we're not gonna drag the swamp, don't worry, I've talked to Trump.
[00:25:22.007 --> 00:25:23.888]  Trump said, go out and publicly apologize.
[00:25:23.888 --> 00:25:25.928]  But you never really heard from Gingrich again, did you?
[00:25:25.928 --> 00:25:27.709]  Speaking for Trump.
[00:25:27.709 --> 00:25:32.270]  They're there trying to undermine his base while they pretend that they're their friends.
[00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.490]  But how beautiful is that?
[00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:43.352]  To see, within 12 hours, puts out the tweets in the afternoon, hits the news at night,
[00:25:44.551 --> 00:25:46.212]  Trump goes and reads it.
[00:25:46.212 --> 00:25:48.214]  You retweeted it, Trump.
[00:25:48.214 --> 00:26:03.905]  You are communicating, the American people, through Drudge, directly with the President of the United States, who is directly listening to you for like three, four hours a night, reading stacks of mail, and he has computers, and Trump more and more is getting on computers himself.
[00:26:03.905 --> 00:26:09.029]  He's learning to cut off the people that quote, bring him what they want him to see.
[00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:12.991]  So he's in there, in his office at night, with computers all around him, himself,
[00:26:13.854 --> 00:26:20.179]  Getting in there, investigating, looking, and making phone calls.
[00:26:20.179 --> 00:26:21.880]  Then about 2 o'clock in the morning he goes to sleep.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.163]  He gets up at about 6.30.
[00:26:25.163 --> 00:26:25.543]  Drudge!
[00:26:25.543 --> 00:26:32.949]  Republican Party should be sued for fraud.
[00:26:32.949 --> 00:26:35.451]  They only know how to be opposition, not lead.
[00:26:35.451 --> 00:26:36.332]  Within hours.
[00:26:36.332 --> 00:26:37.172]  Trump to Drudge.
[00:26:37.172 --> 00:26:39.154]  Phenomenal tax cut package coming in two to three weeks.
[00:26:40.725 --> 00:26:45.268]  We're going to be announcing something, I would say, over the next two or three weeks that will be phenomenal.
[00:26:45.268 --> 00:26:52.093]  President Trump, to his conservative critics, I read you loud and clear.
[00:26:52.093 --> 00:27:00.559]  Last time I talked to Trump, I'm not going to get into it, but he said, you watch, I'm going to massively bring Congress a huge tax cut for across the board.
[00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:02.260]  Alex, I will not let you down.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:02.641]  Watch!
[00:27:09.502 --> 00:27:11.503]  Now let me talk to your wife.
[00:27:11.503 --> 00:27:15.124]  The point is, I mean that was a joke, folks.
[00:27:15.124 --> 00:27:22.387]  The point is, is that this is a crazy, crazy, crazy world.
[00:27:22.387 --> 00:27:31.111]  And the establishment wants full control of everything you do, not just the power structure.
[00:27:31.111 --> 00:27:34.112]  And Trump doesn't want to be a control freak running your life.
[00:27:34.112 --> 00:27:35.913]  He wants to turn you loose.
[00:27:37.006 --> 00:27:38.527]  Sets you free.
[00:27:38.527 --> 00:27:42.649]  And he wants to preside over that.
[00:27:42.649 --> 00:27:54.375]  The bad news is Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, all of them are openly trying to drive down the market, trying to tell everybody to dump their stocks, trying to kill the recovery that never came, that they promised nine years ago.
[00:27:54.375 --> 00:27:55.835]  And they're putting out articles every day.
[00:27:55.835 --> 00:27:56.996]  Signs of a recession!
[00:27:56.996 --> 00:27:58.097]  There should be a recession!
[00:27:58.097 --> 00:27:59.017]  We're seeing signs of it!
[00:27:59.017 --> 00:28:00.478]  It could be a depression!
[00:28:00.478 --> 00:28:04.740]  Now MSM that never pushes doom and gloom, they're pushing doom and gloom right now.
[00:28:05.748 --> 00:28:07.652]  Let's go out to break with Bill Crystal.
[00:28:07.652 --> 00:28:09.756]  White working class should be replaced by immigrants.
[00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:20.638]  Look, to be totally honest, if things are so bad, as you say, with the white working class, don't you want to get new Americans in who aren't going to be... I'm serious.
[00:28:20.638 --> 00:28:29.006]  You can make a case that this is going on too long and this is too crazy, probably, and I hope this thing isn't being videotaped or ever shown anywhere.
[00:28:29.006 --> 00:28:32.890]  Whatever tiny, pathetic future I have is going to be totally collapsed.
[00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.672]  You can make a case that America has been great because every...
[00:28:36.953 --> 00:28:38.754]  I think John Adams said this at the beginning, right?
[00:28:38.754 --> 00:28:47.620]  Basically, if you're in a free society, a capitalist society, after two, three, four generations of hard work, everyone becomes kind of decadent, lazy, spoiled, whatever.
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:29:00.049]  And then you, luckily, you have these waves of people coming in from Italy and Ireland and Russia, and now Mexico, who really want to work hard and really want to succeed and really want their kids to live better lives than them and aren't slipping coupons.
[00:29:07.913 --> 00:29:12.894]  And the point is that he's making it about white people.
[00:29:12.894 --> 00:29:15.815]  And the issue is that's not even statistically overall true.
[00:29:15.815 --> 00:29:22.517]  It's true you do get some decadence in every strata of society once people, you know, basically spoil their kids.
[00:29:22.517 --> 00:29:31.959]  But to just advertise the fact that unlimited giant migrant waves coming to the country is a good thing, or the fact you're being turned into political weapons, well that's just untenable.
[00:29:33.726 --> 00:29:44.929]  And again, that's what you've done, Mr. Crystal, with the Democratic Party, working together to bring us under globalism, is you brought in groups of people and brainwashed them against the country, and that's called treason!
[00:29:44.929 --> 00:29:50.851]  You dirty, little, Trotskyite piece of filth!
[00:29:50.851 --> 00:29:54.772]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.772 --> 00:29:57.453]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.622 --> 00:30:03.224]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:30:41.995 --> 00:30:44.037]  And this part is most important.

[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.281]  That means it's clean.
[00:30:52.281 --> 00:30:53.402]  That means it's pure.
[00:30:53.402 --> 00:30:56.303]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:30:56.303 --> 00:30:59.105]  That's InfoWarsLives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:30:59.105 --> 00:31:00.726]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:31:02.489 --> 00:31:03.850]  Hi there, Dick Allgaier here.
[00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:08.573]  I was a mainstream television news reporter for over three decades.
[00:31:08.573 --> 00:31:12.056]  I normally never do commercial endorsements.
[00:31:12.056 --> 00:31:14.738]  I am very skeptical of health supplements.
[00:31:14.738 --> 00:31:18.821]  But a friend of mine told me about his experience with Synergy One.
[00:31:18.821 --> 00:31:23.204]  So I purchased a bottle and my wife and I have been using it for a few weeks now.
[00:31:23.524 --> 00:31:26.546]  I very much dislike so-called energy boosters.
[00:31:26.546 --> 00:31:32.311]  Those little energy drinks that have caffeine and guarana and other things that make your heart race.
[00:31:32.311 --> 00:31:33.432]  This is not that.
[00:31:33.432 --> 00:31:36.694]  My experience with Synergy One has been great.
[00:31:36.694 --> 00:31:37.935]  My mood is better.
[00:31:37.935 --> 00:31:39.136]  My joints feel better.
[00:31:39.136 --> 00:31:43.880]  I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased productivity.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:47.483]  My wife and I both noticed that we even dream more.
[00:31:47.483 --> 00:31:49.484]  So I recommend Synergy One.
[00:31:49.484 --> 00:31:50.585]  It's really good stuff.
[00:31:50.585 --> 00:31:52.367]  I'm having great results with it.
[00:31:52.967 --> 00:31:58.148]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.

[00:32:58.106 --> 00:33:07.370]  Came in last night at half past ten That baby of mine wouldn't let me in So move it on over
[00:33:18.831 --> 00:33:19.913]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:19.913 --> 00:33:22.036]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:38.735 --> 00:33:40.716]  Who is the dumbest Democrat in the world?
[00:33:40.716 --> 00:33:42.896]  I'm gonna start a contest.
[00:33:42.896 --> 00:33:45.037]  What are we going to do?
[00:33:45.037 --> 00:34:03.304]  How can a president who is acting in the manner that he's acting, whether he's talking about the travel ban, the way that he's targeting Muslims, or whether he's talking about his relationship to Putin and the Kremlin, and knowing that they have hacked our
[00:34:04.304 --> 00:34:20.377]  DCCC and DNC, and knowing that he is responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families in- What is Aleppo?
[00:34:20.377 --> 00:34:21.297]  Yeah, in Aleppo.
[00:34:21.297 --> 00:34:22.658]  You are correct.
[00:34:30.808 --> 00:34:41.461]  The fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea?
[00:34:41.461 --> 00:34:41.901]  Stop it.
[00:34:41.901 --> 00:34:42.262]  Stop it.
[00:34:48.345 --> 00:34:49.565]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:49.565 --> 00:34:59.229]  We're going to make a new one of those from the same press conference when Nancy Pelosi, believing George W. Bush, was still in office and was working with the Russians.
[00:34:59.229 --> 00:35:01.230]  I guess everybody's working with the Russians.
[00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:07.952]  No one can think of Drain the Swamp or Lock Her Up or Hillary for President or Crooked Hillary without Vladimir Putin.
[00:35:07.952 --> 00:35:09.653]  In fact, I couldn't even name my children.
[00:35:10.516 --> 00:35:10.696]  I think?
[00:35:41.957 --> 00:35:45.219]  2016, how Donald Trump orchestrated a revolution.
[00:35:45.219 --> 00:35:46.620]  Powerful book.
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.542]  Infowarsstore.com or call toll free, AAA253-3139.
[00:35:50.542 --> 00:36:02.570]  I'll tell you what's really selling good for $9.95, and that is the revolutionary, new, exclusive, super blue toothpaste, made right here in America,
[00:36:04.545 --> 00:36:08.146]  At the factory that makes the leading brand of fluoride-free.
[00:36:08.146 --> 00:36:09.866]  That's what the formula is.
[00:36:09.866 --> 00:36:12.467]  When you're a private label, you can't say the name.
[00:36:12.467 --> 00:36:14.168]  But everybody knows the name, and it's high quality.
[00:36:14.168 --> 00:36:15.688]  It's what I personally used previously.
[00:36:15.688 --> 00:36:24.310]  And now they add our iodine, our true iodine, deep-earth crystal iodine, and nano-colloidal silver, along with peppermint and tea tree oil.
[00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:26.991]  We have a bubblegum flavor coming out, because, yeah, it's pretty strong.
[00:36:27.671 --> 00:36:30.594]  And so kids don't really like this, but you can get them to do it.
[00:36:30.594 --> 00:36:35.918]  I mean, it doesn't taste bad to me, but you know, as an adult, your taste buds get a different palate.
[00:36:35.918 --> 00:36:36.839]  Shot of Jack Daniels.
[00:36:36.839 --> 00:36:37.500]  Tastes wonderful.
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.522]  Back when you were 14, it burned like hell going down your throat.
[00:36:40.522 --> 00:36:42.684]  Not that I'm a big drinking man, but you know what I mean.
[00:36:42.684 --> 00:36:43.965]  The allegory certainly works.
[00:36:43.965 --> 00:36:49.390]  This is the creme, dollar creme, designed by my dad.
[00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:50.110]  Infowars.
[00:36:51.428 --> 00:36:53.871]  Store.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:36:53.871 --> 00:36:55.633]  And I can't believe it.
[00:36:55.633 --> 00:37:00.118]  We ordered more than double what we got in the first run that sold out in one week.
[00:37:00.118 --> 00:37:07.587]  And it looks like at current sales rates, which is great because it will help us with the operation, we'll be sold out in two weeks of this and then hopefully
[00:37:08.628 --> 00:37:09.349]  More will come in.
[00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:12.591]  But again, it's a gamble to make so much of it and spend all our capital.
[00:37:12.591 --> 00:37:14.493]  But then, it looks like folks love it.
[00:37:14.493 --> 00:37:20.158]  It's got a 4.8 star reviews, 79 reviews on Power Reviews.
[00:37:20.158 --> 00:37:24.061]  I think I really should read a few of these and go to Roger Stone.
[00:37:24.061 --> 00:37:27.163]  This is from Tedom Sue, Norman, Oklahoma.
[00:37:27.163 --> 00:37:29.205]  This is so different than the regular toothpaste.
[00:37:29.205 --> 00:37:30.286]  There is no comparison.
[00:37:30.286 --> 00:37:31.987]  It seems pricey on $9.95.
[00:37:33.789 --> 00:37:35.791]  It costs us like four or five bucks to make it.
[00:37:35.791 --> 00:37:39.913]  It seems pricey, but really isn't because it only dispenses a small amount at a time.
[00:37:39.913 --> 00:37:40.314]  Exactly.
[00:37:40.314 --> 00:37:42.135]  It's concentrated, folks.
[00:37:42.135 --> 00:37:49.540]  It not only keeps my mouth super clean and feeling healthy, it does, doesn't glob up on the toothbrush, rinses so cleanly.
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.022]  I'll never return to the old toxic toothpaste again.
[00:37:52.022 --> 00:37:54.524]  Thanks to Alex and his father for this wonderful product.
[00:37:55.939 --> 00:37:56.740]  Only one of many.
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.402]  Well, thank you for your support.
[00:37:58.402 --> 00:37:59.483]  Here's one more.
[00:37:59.483 --> 00:38:02.746]  This is from Michigander in Mid-Michigan.
[00:38:02.746 --> 00:38:04.047]  Highest quality toothpaste.
[00:38:04.047 --> 00:38:05.549]  Again, five stars.
[00:38:05.549 --> 00:38:07.491]  You really only need a pea size of this toothpaste.
[00:38:07.491 --> 00:38:08.412]  See, same thing.
[00:38:08.412 --> 00:38:09.653]  Especially since it's pricey.
[00:38:09.653 --> 00:38:10.994]  I guess they all see it as pricey.
[00:38:10.994 --> 00:38:15.519]  I guess something that's four dollars and, you know, cost them a dollar to make, you know, seems less pricey.
[00:38:15.519 --> 00:38:16.840]  But this is not what it is.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.882]  Plus, it's a big tube.
[00:38:17.882 --> 00:38:18.802]  However, it is enough.
[00:38:19.423 --> 00:38:21.664]  For a use unlike most others.
[00:38:21.664 --> 00:38:29.789]  Makes your teeth literally squeaky clean and seems to do an amazing job in every way compared to all other toothpaste I've tried.
[00:38:29.789 --> 00:38:33.011]  Bought one for myself and my sister during the Christmas special.
[00:38:33.011 --> 00:38:34.492]  Only halfway through since then.
[00:38:34.492 --> 00:38:35.172]  Amazing product.
[00:38:35.172 --> 00:38:36.393]  Will never use another toothpaste.
[00:38:36.393 --> 00:38:37.474]  Ever.
[00:38:37.474 --> 00:38:42.957]  I would smash a bottle of Colgate or whatever with my foot and smear it on the ground because it's so disgusting.
[00:38:44.281 --> 00:38:49.623]  Yeah, I forgot to get toothpaste when I was in California and I just said, I'm getting some fluoride toothpaste.
[00:38:49.623 --> 00:38:51.383]  It's not bad every once in a while, you know.
[00:38:51.383 --> 00:38:57.065]  So I go down to the gift shop at the hotel and it was just like, it wasn't even like what Colgate was 10 years ago or 20.
[00:38:57.065 --> 00:38:58.545]  It was like, like air.
[00:38:58.545 --> 00:39:01.286]  It was just so thin and it was nothing even in there.
[00:39:01.986 --> 00:39:03.207]  And it didn't even do anything.
[00:39:03.207 --> 00:39:05.688]  I was just scrubbing my teeth for like ten minutes.
[00:39:05.688 --> 00:39:07.689]  With this, like, two minutes is all I need to do.
[00:39:07.689 --> 00:39:08.429]  And I'm a big brusher.
[00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:12.171]  My dad's, you know, a retired dentist, an oral surgeon, and also a chemist.
[00:39:12.171 --> 00:39:14.592]  But the point is, this is an amazing product.
[00:39:14.592 --> 00:39:17.694]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:39:21.513 --> 00:39:23.695]  And again, folks, $9.95, it's not pricey.
[00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:28.239]  You get big tubes of organic toothpaste, you know, they're like $6, $7, $8.
[00:39:28.239 --> 00:39:41.810]  This has even more stuff added that cost even more in the process to go to one of the big giant companies than that have them set up a whole, you know, factory run for you is expensive when you're only getting 20,000 pieces done.
[00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:43.812]  Now, that sounds like a lot.
[00:39:43.812 --> 00:39:48.156]  If we were doing 100,000 pieces, I could get the toothpaste for like $2.
[00:39:49.992 --> 00:39:52.555]  Okay, instead of three or four or five dollars, it just depends.
[00:39:52.555 --> 00:39:55.137]  First run was even smaller, so it costs even more.
[00:39:55.137 --> 00:39:57.399]  That's the problem with boutique stuff.
[00:39:57.399 --> 00:40:00.963]  It's why limited run stuff always costs more.
[00:40:00.963 --> 00:40:08.270]  If people just demanded higher quality in the market, just like they're doing with organics, it would up the market, there'd be more production, prices would fall.
[00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:10.272]  That's how supply and demand works.
[00:40:10.272 --> 00:40:12.294]  But you first gotta build the market.
[00:40:13.496 --> 00:40:17.819]  At first you bring something to market, it either fails or succeeds, but it costs you more.
[00:40:17.819 --> 00:40:21.161]  And people early on usually have to pay more or you've got to invest.
[00:40:21.161 --> 00:40:27.025]  Then it tends to become a hit, if it is a hit, and then production goes up, price goes down.
[00:40:27.025 --> 00:40:28.986]  That's how real economics works.
[00:40:28.986 --> 00:40:30.708]  InfoWarsStore.com
[00:40:31.488 --> 00:40:36.851]  Thank you all for your support, but believe me, you know, the four or five bucks we make on this, we desperately need it.
[00:40:36.851 --> 00:40:38.812]  So buy a t-shirt when you're there.
[00:40:38.812 --> 00:40:41.834]  Buy a Hillary for Prison 2017 shirt.
[00:40:41.834 --> 00:40:44.496]  Looks like it might happen with Jeff Sessions now, huh folks?
[00:40:44.496 --> 00:40:44.856]  So again...
[00:40:46.269 --> 00:40:48.190]  InfoWars is the operation you're building.
[00:40:48.190 --> 00:41:03.954]  Please support our local AM and FM affiliates as well and their local sponsors or become a sponsor or send them a donation because we're now on over 250 plus stations because listeners are supporting the stations and spreading the word and you know InfoWars is everywhere now and we're really having a big effect.
[00:41:03.954 --> 00:41:05.434]  Again, Joe Rogan, talked to him yesterday.
[00:41:07.262 --> 00:41:15.129]  And he said, undoubtedly, this is the biggest podcast in history, in the world, and they're delisting it off Google, trying to block it off iTunes.
[00:41:15.129 --> 00:41:18.492]  Also, they will not allow it to trend on YouTube.
[00:41:18.492 --> 00:41:25.338]  But he added it all together, and this is already double any podcast basically Joe Rogan's ever had.
[00:41:25.338 --> 00:41:28.922]  And he's had some of their eight years, and he's the number one podcaster, folks.
[00:41:28.922 --> 00:41:32.065]  So, understand total domination.
[00:41:33.137 --> 00:41:34.358]  And again, I'm not bragging.
[00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:37.781]  I want you to understand we're having a huge effect.
[00:41:37.781 --> 00:41:40.404]  He's the number one comic on iTunes.
[00:41:40.404 --> 00:41:41.705]  Number one on Google.
[00:41:41.705 --> 00:41:47.049]  He's in the top ten undisputed comedians in the world today.
[00:41:47.049 --> 00:41:51.073]  And the 9-11 broadcast is the biggest podcast in history.
[00:41:51.073 --> 00:41:55.157]  And it's being blocked from the top trends.
[00:41:55.157 --> 00:41:56.938]  Okay, let's just stop right there.
[00:41:56.938 --> 00:41:58.460]  I want to go to our guest until the end of the hour.
[00:41:59.642 --> 00:42:07.667]  Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, the man that also got him to run back in 2000, joins us to cover a lot of big developments.
[00:42:07.667 --> 00:42:11.549]  Obviously, sessions being confirmed yesterday and a lot more.
[00:42:11.549 --> 00:42:13.810]  But also, I want to pick your brain, Roger.
[00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:17.652]  You know, a lot of times you don't really leak stuff to anybody, including me.
[00:42:17.652 --> 00:42:21.114]  You've given me some trends to watch and they've always come true.
[00:42:21.114 --> 00:42:24.857]  But I have a lot of sources telling me that we know who the leakers are in the White House.
[00:42:24.857 --> 00:42:25.957]  It's very serious.
[00:42:25.957 --> 00:42:26.938]  I have military sources.
[00:42:27.979 --> 00:42:39.531]  Confirming the intel that it appears that a leak did get the targets out to ISIS and Al Qaeda in an attempt to Bay of Pigs, aka Kennedy, embarrass Trump.
[00:42:39.531 --> 00:42:41.353]  We're investigating that more.
[00:42:41.353 --> 00:42:43.715]  We certainly have intel that it happened.
[00:42:43.715 --> 00:42:45.337]  We're just not exactly sure who.
[00:42:45.337 --> 00:42:48.961]  But we do know who's leaking in many cases, and this is just amazing.
[00:42:49.121 --> 00:42:56.368]  I don't know if you're ready to get into that, but I need to talk to you over the show today about my sources so we can share notes, but there's so much happening.
[00:42:56.368 --> 00:43:00.432]  But first off, congratulations on your book being number one on Amazon political.
[00:43:00.432 --> 00:43:02.274]  Well, thank you very much, Alex.
[00:43:02.274 --> 00:43:07.900]  I guess now would probably be the right time to announce that I confess everything.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.923]  Vladimir Putin dictated every word of my book.
[00:43:11.724 --> 00:43:12.265]  Every word.
[00:43:12.265 --> 00:43:14.107]  He wrote the whole thing.
[00:43:14.107 --> 00:43:17.092]  So we might as well get that up front right away.
[00:43:17.092 --> 00:43:28.187]  This whole idea that you and I work for the Russians or that there was any link between the Trump campaign and Russia is getting tedious because it is ridiculously false.
[00:43:29.327 --> 00:43:33.589]  Just like, you know, Vladimir Putin naming your children.
[00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:35.310]  By the way, I met your son Nikita.
[00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:36.270]  Very nice kid.
[00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:37.790]  Yes.
[00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:41.992]  You know, it's absurd the idea that he's writing my book or putting words in Trump's mouth.
[00:43:41.992 --> 00:43:43.973]  It's absurd.
[00:43:43.973 --> 00:43:46.534]  And the deep state has run this one into the ground.
[00:43:46.534 --> 00:43:48.534]  Nobody's buying.
[00:43:48.534 --> 00:43:54.817]  Secondarily, I congratulate you on the incredible numbers on this podcast with Joe Rogan.
[00:43:54.817 --> 00:43:57.178]  But I understand this whole trend towards censorship.
[00:43:58.399 --> 00:44:01.283]  Suddenly, my Twitter feed is unverified.
[00:44:01.283 --> 00:44:05.189]  I had to fight with them to get verified to begin with.
[00:44:05.189 --> 00:44:09.937]  But there are several other people posing as Roger Stone, posting nasty stuff.
[00:44:09.937 --> 00:44:13.422]  They finally verified me, which has been a long, epic time.
[00:44:13.622 --> 00:44:15.304]  And by the way, they've kicked Milo off.
[00:44:15.304 --> 00:44:18.387]  They've announced they're blocking alt-right material.
[00:44:18.387 --> 00:44:20.669]  The Daily Mail, I think it's a great paper.
[00:44:20.669 --> 00:44:25.333]  Sure, they cover some swimsuit stuff and Hollywood news, but so much of the news is really cutting edge.
[00:44:25.333 --> 00:44:28.556]  The Daily Mail's been banned as fake news by Wikipedia.
[00:44:28.556 --> 00:44:30.358]  I mean, Wikipedia's fake compared to them.
[00:44:30.358 --> 00:44:32.160]  This is a real purge going on.
[00:44:33.221 --> 00:44:37.222]  And I now notice that they have some kind of go slow mechanism.
[00:44:37.222 --> 00:44:42.604]  So in the past, my, you know, if I put up a provocative tweet or a newsworthy tweet.
[00:44:42.604 --> 00:44:42.904]  That's right.
[00:44:42.904 --> 00:44:44.444]  They put governors on everybody.
[00:44:44.444 --> 00:44:45.364]  We always knew it.
[00:44:45.364 --> 00:44:47.025]  Now they admit it.
[00:44:47.025 --> 00:44:52.646]  You know, now now instead of getting a couple thousand retweets, I'm getting a couple hundred retweets.
[00:44:52.646 --> 00:44:54.487]  It is it is really distressing.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:06.706]  You raise the question, what is the President going to do about this new, you know, censorship board that has been financed now, approved and financed by the Congress?
[00:45:06.706 --> 00:45:10.988]  This was clearly the vehicle Hillary Clinton was going to use to silence us.
[00:45:12.164 --> 00:45:20.771]  Uh, no one should understand the value of alternative media more than Steve Bannon, who is right there at the President's sleeve.
[00:45:20.771 --> 00:45:26.235]  And by the way, just to interrupt, Dr. Corsi's big article at InfoWars.com yesterday got the secret document.
[00:45:26.235 --> 00:45:38.284]  It was also then reported in other papers, uh, where Brock is intending to head up this new State Department operation with Snopes and a mail order diploma outfit.
[00:45:38.284 --> 00:45:40.406]  That's who supposedly is now going to run things.
[00:45:40.686 --> 00:45:46.772]  So I guess Trump needs to be made aware of the fact that his archenemy, David Brock, I guess, is going to be running the State Department.
[00:45:46.772 --> 00:45:48.954]  Yeah, it's really extraordinary.
[00:45:48.954 --> 00:45:52.257]  And congratulations to Dr. Corsi.
[00:45:52.257 --> 00:45:58.883]  That was an incredible piece that I think ripped back the veil from exactly what they have going on.
[00:45:58.883 --> 00:46:03.928]  They have to resort to censorship because the truth kills all cockroaches.
[00:46:03.928 --> 00:46:05.689]  That's their real fundamental problem.
[00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:09.834]  That's right, and we are wrecking them on every front.
[00:46:09.834 --> 00:46:21.309]  Paul has more Twitter impressions than all BBC tweets combined, and he's so big, he hasn't caught them dialing him back too much, though they're starting to freeze his account, Facebook's doing it.
[00:46:21.309 --> 00:46:23.713]  I mean, clearly they're testing shutting us down.
[00:46:25.231 --> 00:46:27.795]  Well, perhaps it's because we are the rallying point.
[00:46:27.795 --> 00:46:30.238]  This is the resistance.
[00:46:30.238 --> 00:46:39.410]  I can't even begin to tell you the number of people when you go to New York City, when you walk three or four blocks, the number of people, and this is in ultra-liberal New York,
[00:46:40.111 --> 00:46:43.434]  People come up and say to me, God bless you, God bless Alex.
[00:46:43.434 --> 00:46:45.236]  I see you all the time on InfoWars.
[00:46:45.236 --> 00:46:47.879]  If it wasn't for you guys, we'd never know the truth.
[00:46:47.879 --> 00:46:48.679]  I mean, it's heartening.
[00:46:48.679 --> 00:46:49.520]  It's really heartening.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:51.322]  And they're people from all stratas.
[00:46:51.322 --> 00:46:51.722]  Exactly.
[00:46:51.722 --> 00:46:52.683]  We're not bragging.
[00:46:52.683 --> 00:46:54.705]  I mean, you just, we're number one.
[00:46:54.705 --> 00:46:55.706]  Drudge is number one.
[00:46:55.706 --> 00:46:59.170]  Look at how Drudge says, hey, Trump, you better start cutting taxes.
[00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:00.331]  And Trump responds in hours.
[00:47:00.331 --> 00:47:01.792]  Yes, yes, Drudge, I'm on it.
[00:47:01.792 --> 00:47:02.993]  And I mean, that's good.
[00:47:02.993 --> 00:47:04.315]  That shows how responsive he is.
[00:47:05.182 --> 00:47:10.215]  Well, I think he understands the coalition that elected him, and the incredible
[00:47:12.661 --> 00:47:19.145]  Coming together of those voters who were fed up with the rigged system.
[00:47:19.145 --> 00:47:22.847]  My concern is whether some of the people around him understand that.
[00:47:22.847 --> 00:47:29.952]  We certainly know that Steve Bannon, who I defended on the Charlie Rose Show night before last, he understands it.
[00:47:29.952 --> 00:47:40.078]  But when you surround yourself with these establishment Republicans who have no loyalty to you or to your candidacy when you were running, or to your presidency,
[00:47:42.399 --> 00:47:46.581]  Is it surprising that the White House leaked like a sieve?
[00:47:46.581 --> 00:47:50.463]  I mean, this is the lowest form of disloyalty.
[00:47:50.463 --> 00:47:51.324]  Sure, it is.
[00:47:51.324 --> 00:47:53.345]  I'm a believer in strategic leaking.
[00:47:53.345 --> 00:47:58.127]  If the President orders something leaked for a strategic reason, that's one thing.
[00:47:58.127 --> 00:48:00.848]  That's right, you leak only when the President tells you to.
[00:48:00.848 --> 00:48:11.354]  Well, if you work for the President, or if you're trying to reach some... No, I'm saying if people inside the White House shouldn't be leaking, but they want to be darlings with the media, and you notice the media loving Rince Priebus, oh my goodness.
[00:48:13.126 --> 00:48:16.589]  Yeah, no, look, I think that's precisely the problem.
[00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:24.796]  So when you're leaking and your leak makes the principal look bad, makes the president look bad, that's beyond disgusting.
[00:48:24.796 --> 00:48:27.538]  That is just, that's just treasonous.
[00:48:27.538 --> 00:48:30.360]  We have the Washington Post quoting a White House staffer.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.783]  The president is like a clueless child.
[00:48:33.783 --> 00:48:35.364]  We have the New York Times.
[00:48:35.364 --> 00:48:38.247]  The president is wandering the halls wearing a bathrobe.
[00:48:39.164 --> 00:48:39.887]  Well, you know what?
[00:48:39.887 --> 00:48:44.645]  The White House is drafty, and if the president wants to wear a bathrobe in the family quarters after hours...
[00:48:45.436 --> 00:48:46.157]  Who cares?
[00:48:46.157 --> 00:48:48.898]  And by the way, he's working till 2 in the morning.
[00:48:48.898 --> 00:48:51.000]  Thank God he's working in a bathrobe.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.301]  Well, that place is drafty.
[00:48:52.301 --> 00:48:52.921]  I've been there.
[00:48:52.921 --> 00:48:53.621]  I've worked there.
[00:48:53.621 --> 00:49:04.749]  So, uh, this is the kind of nitpicking, uh, that the media loves, but they wouldn't be able to write it if they didn't have... But, I mean, my family asked me to put a bathrobe on when I'm wandering around in my underwear.
[00:49:04.749 --> 00:49:05.589]  I mean, big deal.
[00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:07.470]  Again, he has enemies around him.
[00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:09.652]  He should completely trust everyone around him.
[00:49:10.629 --> 00:49:17.374]  Well, the leakers have to be found, and we're going to get into this more, I can see, in the next couple weeks.
[00:49:17.374 --> 00:49:21.077]  I know the President finds these leaks very disappointing.
[00:49:21.077 --> 00:49:23.558]  I know he's very unhappy about them.
[00:49:23.558 --> 00:49:26.641]  They're very hard to nail down, of course.
[00:49:26.641 --> 00:49:28.622]  It also shows the arrogance.
[00:49:28.622 --> 00:49:31.204]  Well, we know who's doing it, we're going to give them the info.
[00:49:31.204 --> 00:49:37.729]  It shows how dumb certain people are that they think they're going to get away with leaking when we know basically everybody and everything.
[00:49:38.598 --> 00:49:40.420]  Well, you put your finger on it.
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:45.464]  The motive of the leakers is self-aggrandizement.
[00:49:45.464 --> 00:49:50.528]  The motive of the leakers is to suck up to the reporters they leaked to so they can look more important.
[00:49:51.287 --> 00:49:56.692]  I know, and what's crazy is they don't get being... I told Rispiglio yesterday, I said, I want you to attack me.
[00:49:56.692 --> 00:49:57.393]  Don't you understand?
[00:49:57.393 --> 00:49:58.814]  I don't care.
[00:49:58.814 --> 00:50:03.118]  Because if you ever endorse me, it would hurt me because the public knows you're scum.
[00:50:03.118 --> 00:50:04.079]  Do you understand?
[00:50:04.079 --> 00:50:05.680]  I don't want a Fox show.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:08.082]  I don't want to be endorsed by them.
[00:50:08.082 --> 00:50:08.863]  Okay?
[00:50:08.863 --> 00:50:17.191]  I'm just pointing out the fact that what's Tucker Carlson doing having Redcoat on his show, Piers Morgan, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:50:18.123 --> 00:50:21.584]  Yeah, no, it's a... I share that disappointment.
[00:50:21.584 --> 00:50:27.667]  In the five books that I have written, this is the only one for which I have not yet been invited.
[00:50:27.667 --> 00:50:29.568]  It's because you are so important.
[00:50:29.568 --> 00:50:31.829]  You are so effective.
[00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:32.989]  It's because of that.
[00:50:32.989 --> 00:50:36.270]  If you were a nobody, you'd be on all these shows because you'd be controllable.
[00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:38.591]  And again, we don't even need to be on their shows.
[00:50:38.591 --> 00:50:40.472]  But just look at how pathetic it is.
[00:50:40.472 --> 00:50:41.632]  Understand that, audience.
[00:50:41.632 --> 00:50:47.535]  It's because you spread the word, you listen, you spread the links, you support the broadcast, that we are destroying them.
[00:50:47.955 --> 00:50:49.517]  And they cannot stand it.
[00:50:49.517 --> 00:50:50.439]  But who's there?
[00:50:50.439 --> 00:50:53.383]  Who stood up for your tax cuts when they started to drift off?
[00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:54.404]  Matt Drudge.
[00:50:54.404 --> 00:50:56.387]  I don't kiss his butt for no reason.
[00:50:56.387 --> 00:51:00.433]  The guy without Drudge, we would be up the creek without a you-know-what.
[00:51:00.433 --> 00:51:00.853]  We'll be back.
[00:51:01.561 --> 00:51:02.861]  Happy Valentine's Day, honey.
[00:51:02.861 --> 00:51:04.322]  Wow, look at these roses!
[00:51:04.322 --> 00:51:05.422]  They're gorgeous!
[00:51:05.422 --> 00:51:06.823]  You didn't have to get me these.
[00:51:06.823 --> 00:51:10.244]  I couldn't let Valentine's Day come and go without surprising you with flowers.
[00:51:10.244 --> 00:51:11.564]  Aw, thank you!
[00:51:11.564 --> 00:51:17.306]  Guys, this Valentine's Day, even though she says you don't have to get her flowers, take it from me, send her flowers!
[00:51:17.306 --> 00:51:18.946]  She'll be so happy when you do.
[00:51:18.946 --> 00:51:26.669]  And right now, you can get her a stunning bouquet of two dozen assorted roses with a free glass vase for $29.99 plus shipping and handling.

[00:52:04.721 --> 00:52:10.606]  I watched several YouTube videos of Steven Heuer's and learned what supplements might help me with energy and weight loss.
[00:52:10.606 --> 00:52:17.173]  I've now been on the Andreas Black cumin seed oil, Synergy One, 600 products from Synergistic Nutrition for several weeks now.
[00:52:17.173 --> 00:52:18.714]  I've lost 10 pounds.

[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:46.440]  Attention patriots.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:49.201]  Tired of the tyranny and crime in the sanctuary cities?
[00:53:49.201 --> 00:53:51.962]  Flee the city and seek refuge in the American redoubt.
[00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:53.502]  FleeTheCity.com.
[00:53:53.502 --> 00:53:56.403]  Move to the freedom of Idaho, Montana, or Wyoming.

[00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:28.234]  If it keeps on raining, love is gonna break.
[00:54:28.234 --> 00:54:32.778]  And when the levee breaks, I have no place to stay.
[00:54:32.778 --> 00:54:36.462]  Going down, going down now, down to Chicago.
[00:54:37.643 --> 00:54:43.748]  Trump just signed another executive order to increase law enforcement and federal aid into places like Chicago.
[00:54:43.748 --> 00:54:45.269]  So he's going down to Chicago.
[00:54:45.269 --> 00:54:47.130]  What in the world is going on in Chicago?
[00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:49.912]  Dr. Jerome Corsi is joining us with big breaking news.
[00:54:49.912 --> 00:54:58.338]  And then we have Saliha Farber, big reporter for major newspapers in Europe, documenting the Islamic rape epidemic and the cover-up of that.
[00:54:58.338 --> 00:54:58.999]  That's coming up.
[00:54:58.999 --> 00:55:00.240]  And John Rappaport exposing
[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:03.945]  What's really going on at modern colleges is mind control.
[00:55:03.945 --> 00:55:06.088]  Roger, what do you make of Sessions?
[00:55:06.088 --> 00:55:13.639]  Now, at least Trump's got one more great ally in there, Stephen Bannon, and I know Jeff Sessions is the real McCoy.
[00:55:13.639 --> 00:55:15.161]  This is a big victory for the Republic.
[00:55:16.454 --> 00:55:20.836]  Yeah, I think Sessions is a very, very solid guy, a true patriot.
[00:55:20.836 --> 00:55:25.237]  I don't share his views on the legal marijuana in 32 states.
[00:55:25.237 --> 00:55:27.858]  I think he's off base there.
[00:55:27.858 --> 00:55:33.240]  But beyond that, he's going to be a tough, by the book, law and order attorney general.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:43.144]  And you're not going to have the kind of corruption and abuse that we had under Eric Holder or his successor, Loretta Lynch.
[00:55:44.344 --> 00:55:46.706]  Oh, he's not going to meet on airplanes?
[00:55:46.706 --> 00:55:50.928]  He's not going to meet on airplanes?
[00:55:50.928 --> 00:55:54.991]  What do you make of Schumer saying it turned his stomach when it was confirmed?
[00:55:54.991 --> 00:55:56.592]  Looking at Schumer turns my stomach.
[00:55:57.361 --> 00:55:58.082]  Yeah, he is.
[00:55:58.082 --> 00:55:59.563]  The guy's a meat kite.
[00:55:59.563 --> 00:56:01.365]  He's just an awful human being.
[00:56:01.365 --> 00:56:09.013]  And everyone knows that if you want chalk, you merely need to deliver a sizable special interest campaign contribution.
[00:56:09.013 --> 00:56:13.058]  He is the senator not just for Wall Street, but of Wall Street.
[00:56:13.058 --> 00:56:17.943]  If you take that credit card out of your pocket and you wonder why the interest rates are so high on the balance,
[00:56:18.423 --> 00:56:19.783]  You can thank Chuck Schumer.
[00:56:19.783 --> 00:56:21.304]  That's his legislation.
[00:56:21.304 --> 00:56:25.105]  I'm sure the banks rewarded him with enormous campaign funds.
[00:56:25.105 --> 00:56:25.445]  That's right.
[00:56:25.445 --> 00:56:27.946]  He is a known loan shark supporter.
[00:56:27.946 --> 00:56:29.366]  Low interest loans on poor people.
[00:56:29.366 --> 00:56:30.586]  I mean, high interest loans.
[00:56:30.586 --> 00:56:32.387]  He is a real monster.
[00:56:32.387 --> 00:56:36.248]  Looks like a villain out of a movie, but his actions are true pedigree.
[00:56:36.248 --> 00:56:38.388]  In the last few minutes, what else is on the radar?
[00:56:38.388 --> 00:56:39.309]  A lot happening.
[00:56:39.309 --> 00:56:40.249]  What else are you focused on?
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:48.385]  Well, like you, I'm very happy that the President is now going to turn to his tax reform plan and to tax relief.
[00:56:48.385 --> 00:56:57.771]  I honestly believe his plan to cut the corporate tax rate could be the single greatest generator of jobs in decades.
[00:56:57.771 --> 00:57:02.554]  Larry Kudlow has written very eloquently on this subject.
[00:57:02.554 --> 00:57:08.838]  That's right, and a lot of top economists are saying, we were already going into deep recession when Obama left, we need to supercharge now.
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:16.464]  Absolutely, and I think that is what the president and the team around him are working on and focusing on.
[00:57:16.464 --> 00:57:20.807]  So Alex, thanks for the successful launch of the book.
[00:57:20.807 --> 00:57:27.652]  It's going extraordinarily well, despite the efforts of the New York Times and the Washington Post to ignore it.
[00:57:27.652 --> 00:57:29.873]  They both sent for copies in advance.
[00:57:29.873 --> 00:57:32.715]  They were both given copies in advance.
[00:57:32.715 --> 00:57:34.236]  I'm not holding my breath.
[00:57:35.132 --> 00:57:35.873]  We're good to go.
[00:57:51.548 --> 00:57:52.629]  Please bear with me.
[00:57:52.629 --> 00:57:54.550]  I'm signing as fast as I can.
[00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:55.771]  Yeah, and I've got to get to signing.
[00:57:55.771 --> 00:57:56.952]  I'm going to have to stop in a few days.
[00:57:56.952 --> 00:57:59.274]  But if you get your order in now, I will sign it as well as not.
[00:57:59.274 --> 00:58:00.155]  Up to 15,000 books.
[00:58:00.155 --> 00:58:02.196]  Roger's going to sign them all.
[00:58:02.196 --> 00:58:04.058]  Roger Stone, making him president of Fort Worth Short.com.
[00:58:04.058 --> 00:58:09.301]  In closing, Milo nicely has invited me out to Florida for a big victory deal on the beach.
[00:58:09.301 --> 00:58:11.583]  You know, party against the control freaks.
[00:58:11.583 --> 00:58:13.645]  But maybe you should come to be a chaperone.
[00:58:14.045 --> 00:58:17.588]  Yeah, I better, because you guys will definitely get in trouble if I'm not there.
[00:58:17.588 --> 00:58:19.150]  Well, yeah, you know.
[00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:22.232]  So I need you there to protect me.
[00:58:22.232 --> 00:58:24.654]  Let me know when, and I'll be happy to provide protection.
[00:58:24.654 --> 00:58:25.255]  Of course, I'm joking.
[00:58:25.255 --> 00:58:26.296]  I don't think I'm Milo's type.
[00:58:26.296 --> 00:58:27.297]  I think he likes black guys.
[00:58:27.297 --> 00:58:29.459]  But seriously, Milo's really a funny guy.
[00:58:29.459 --> 00:58:31.480]  I fight for free speech as well, being a citizen as well.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:33.262]  All right, well, I'll see you in Florida next week.
[00:58:33.262 --> 00:58:34.683]  Roger, thank you so much.
[00:58:34.683 --> 00:58:35.504]  Sounds great.
[00:58:35.504 --> 00:58:36.445]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:58:36.445 --> 00:58:39.748]  All right, we'll be back with our number two straight ahead.
[00:58:42.037 --> 00:58:45.560]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:51.306]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.306 --> 00:58:54.549]  We have a priest in New Jersey who is starting to sound like one of us.
[00:58:54.549 --> 00:59:00.794]  Father Peter West, a Catholic priest in the Archdiocese of Newark, is an avid Trump supporter and not afraid to show it.
[00:59:00.794 --> 00:59:07.801]  This is a priest who posts on social media daily, taking on such topics as radical Islam, millennial safe spaces, and modern-day liberals.
[00:59:08.041 --> 00:59:14.509]  Now Father West has fallen under scrutiny from some of his colleagues who believe he is acting inappropriately and has gone too far.
[00:59:14.509 --> 00:59:16.331]  In 2004, a former St.
[00:59:16.331 --> 00:59:25.802]  Louis Archbishop, Cardinal Raymond Burke, took a hard political stance when he refused to allow the at-the-time Senator John Kerry to receive communion for his pro-choice views.
[00:59:25.802 --> 00:59:27.804]  Now, Burke is an avid Trump supporter,
[00:59:27.964 --> 00:59:29.824]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:26.082]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:26.082 --> 01:00:33.468]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:33.468 --> 01:00:38.691]  We have a corrupt elite in power and we're blasting them out of their place, so to speak.
[01:00:38.691 --> 01:00:48.659]  The banner of human liberty, the banner of humans, is moving forward against the technocrats that dream they were gods because they
[01:00:50.382 --> 01:00:55.065]  Cat here with all the technology that their fellow humans have developed and believe that they owned it all.
[01:00:55.065 --> 01:00:58.047]  Old-fashioned megalomania writ large.
[01:00:58.047 --> 01:00:59.568]  I want to open the phones up.
[01:00:59.568 --> 01:01:00.889]  Not that I have lack of news.
[01:01:00.889 --> 01:01:04.452]  Boy, there is a lot of it.
[01:01:04.452 --> 01:01:11.437]  But I want to open the phones up specifically for first-time callers before Dr. Corsi joins us at the bottom of the hour to say, what do you think of Trump so far?
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:13.940]  What do you think of Sessions?
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:14.921]  What do you think of the wall?
[01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:17.001]  What do you think of killing carbon taxes?
[01:01:17.001 --> 01:01:18.782]  Is the Republicans still pushing?
[01:01:18.782 --> 01:01:20.703]  And what do you think of the top six Republicans?
[01:01:20.703 --> 01:01:22.123]  Will you guys reprint me that from two days ago?
[01:01:22.123 --> 01:01:23.964]  Sorry.
[01:01:23.964 --> 01:01:27.925]  The headline was, uh, Backstabbers.
[01:01:27.925 --> 01:01:30.566]  Top six Republicans got massive Soros funding.
[01:01:30.566 --> 01:01:31.686]  And you can see their agenda.
[01:01:31.686 --> 01:01:33.827]  Globalism.
[01:01:33.827 --> 01:01:35.147]  And Reince Priebus up there.
[01:01:35.147 --> 01:01:38.429]  Reince Priebus is doing some nasty stuff, man.
[01:01:38.429 --> 01:01:42.450]  He'll call in patriots that are in the administration and go, President wants you to resign.
[01:01:44.226 --> 01:01:45.406]  And they'll go, I'm running for the president.
[01:01:45.406 --> 01:01:47.287]  They'll say, yeah, get your stuff, get out of here.
[01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:50.748]  He'll be moving somebody into their office, and then they'll go actually ask the president.
[01:01:50.748 --> 01:01:51.709]  The president goes, no, stay here.
[01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:52.749]  I didn't say that.
[01:01:52.749 --> 01:01:58.311]  So Priebus is kind of like an alien getting over by the airlock.
[01:01:58.311 --> 01:02:02.453]  Sigourney Weaver is Trump going, oh, oh, airlock, oh, bye-bye.
[01:02:03.792 --> 01:02:22.939]  Maybe he could scrabble back under the skirts of somebody, but I think the Goblin Guide has given the Golden Toad quite enough of a tour of the catacombs.
[01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:25.179]  So that's all coming up.
[01:02:25.179 --> 01:02:26.480]  By the way, talk about marketing.
[01:02:27.591 --> 01:02:28.992]  I'm not a marketing genius.
[01:02:28.992 --> 01:02:30.874]  I just promote and sell what I believe in.
[01:02:30.874 --> 01:02:38.461]  I wasn't going to do a plug right now, but when we come back, I'm going to take your calls and we're going to plug now.
[01:02:38.461 --> 01:02:38.641]  800-259-9231.
[01:02:38.641 --> 01:02:40.043]  800-259-9231 is the number to join us.
[01:02:40.043 --> 01:02:45.488]  Talk about any issue you want, but I'd like to get into these big ones here that we just mentioned.
[01:02:45.488 --> 01:02:46.088]  800-259-9231.
[01:02:46.088 --> 01:02:52.974]  But I was sitting here from the amazing folks at My Patriot Supply that produce the Alexa Pure Water Filters and the Alexa Breeze.
[01:02:54.051 --> 01:02:56.974]  Air filters are all game-changing, very low price for what you get.
[01:02:56.974 --> 01:02:59.496]  We sell them all on Infowarsstore.com.
[01:02:59.496 --> 01:03:01.517]  And I was familiar with this type of technology.
[01:03:01.517 --> 01:03:05.761]  Just the price is really, really, again, very, very affordable on these.
[01:03:05.761 --> 01:03:10.545]  But they're calling it a filter on the go for your car.
[01:03:10.545 --> 01:03:12.146]  But it's not really an air filter.
[01:03:12.146 --> 01:03:15.009]  As you look at it, it plugs in a cigarette lighter.
[01:03:15.009 --> 01:03:19.152]  I said, that looks like an ionizer.
[01:03:19.152 --> 01:03:19.933]  And sure enough,
[01:03:21.263 --> 01:03:24.392]  It's got a really low price for an ionizer that goes in your car.
[01:03:24.392 --> 01:03:27.341]  I've had it, it works really good.
[01:03:27.341 --> 01:03:28.244]  But you should call it...
[01:03:30.359 --> 01:03:36.264]  Not the Breeze Micro, but something like, you know, the Workhorse Negative Ion Charger.
[01:03:36.264 --> 01:03:37.364]  Because that's what it does.
[01:03:37.364 --> 01:03:39.906]  And it just knocks out the pollen, the bacteria.
[01:03:39.906 --> 01:03:43.549]  I mean, this is something that is really good for your car.
[01:03:43.549 --> 01:03:46.471]  And really, you know, you just leave this in there when you're driving around.
[01:03:46.471 --> 01:03:47.672]  Clears out all those smells.
[01:03:47.672 --> 01:03:49.694]  Kids spilt milk in the car, you know, a month ago.
[01:03:49.694 --> 01:03:51.955]  You're still smelling it no matter how many times you shampoo it.
[01:03:51.955 --> 01:03:53.477]  Believe me, I know.
[01:03:53.477 --> 01:03:56.499]  These babies are perfect for things like that.
[01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:57.780]  It's amazing.
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:58.300]  It's available.
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:58.981]  We'll put it up on screen.
[01:04:01.977 --> 01:04:07.682]  At Infowarestore.com, it's only $19.95, and again, it should be advertised.
[01:04:07.682 --> 01:04:08.623]  That's how we're advertising.
[01:04:08.623 --> 01:04:09.283]  This is what it is.
[01:04:09.283 --> 01:04:12.065]  People look at this and go, this is an air purifier?
[01:04:12.065 --> 01:04:12.826]  No.
[01:04:12.826 --> 01:04:13.587]  No.
[01:04:13.587 --> 01:04:19.592]  It's basically like a micro ozone generator, but they've gotten better than ozone generators over the years.
[01:04:19.592 --> 01:04:22.994]  What you want is negative ions.
[01:04:24.045 --> 01:04:29.889]  Mole spores, pollen, pet dander, odor, cigarette smoke, bacteria, viruses, dust, and other airborne particles.
[01:04:29.889 --> 01:04:31.470]  This is the super product.
[01:04:32.233 --> 01:04:33.554]  No reviews yet.
[01:04:33.554 --> 01:04:35.134]  My review is it's excellent.
[01:04:35.134 --> 01:04:39.116]  Let's tell the other great products from the folks at Alexa Pure.
[01:04:39.116 --> 01:04:40.356]  What a great name they chose!
[01:04:40.356 --> 01:04:42.257]  They came up with all this a few years ago.
[01:04:42.257 --> 01:04:45.278]  Almost like they had it in mind for a show, they wanted to sell it all.
[01:04:45.278 --> 01:04:48.040]  But I'm telling you, I use this stuff in my house.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:53.262]  They're purifiers, they're air purifiers, because they're the best out there at like half the cost.
[01:04:53.262 --> 01:04:55.203]  They are a game-changing company.
[01:04:55.203 --> 01:04:57.844]  There's a reason my Patriot Supply only started like eight years ago.
[01:04:57.844 --> 01:04:59.104]  It was already the biggest company in the world.
[01:04:59.104 --> 01:05:00.025]  It's horrible food.
[01:05:00.025 --> 01:05:00.525]  They dominate.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.604]  We have a priest in New Jersey who is starting to sound like one of us.
[01:05:04.604 --> 01:05:10.832]  Father Peter West, a Catholic priest in the Archdiocese of Newark, is an avid Trump supporter and not afraid to show it.
[01:05:10.832 --> 01:05:17.861]  This is a priest who posts on social media daily, taking on such topics as radical Islam, millennial safe spaces, and modern day liberals.
[01:05:18.101 --> 01:05:24.565]  Now Father West has fallen under scrutiny from some of his colleagues who believe he is acting inappropriately and has gone too far.
[01:05:24.565 --> 01:05:26.386]  In 2004, a former St.
[01:05:26.386 --> 01:05:35.851]  Louis Archbishop, Cardinal Raymond Burke, took a hard political stance when he refused to allow the at-the-time Senator John Kerry to receive communion for his pro-choice views.
[01:05:35.851 --> 01:05:37.852]  Now, Burke is an avid Trump supporter,
[01:05:38.032 --> 01:05:39.953]  This is Owen Troyer for InfoWars.com, so not PC.
[01:06:01.067 --> 01:06:01.888]  Hey, everyone.
[01:06:01.888 --> 01:06:04.190]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:08.033]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:06:08.033 --> 01:06:10.115]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:06:10.115 --> 01:06:20.384]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:06:20.384 --> 01:06:26.369]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:43.688]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work,
[01:06:44.128 --> 01:06:44.669]  We're good to go.
[01:07:00.791 --> 01:07:02.752]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:04.073]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:07:04.073 --> 01:07:05.294]  Why is this so good?
[01:07:05.294 --> 01:07:10.577]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:07:10.577 --> 01:07:24.106]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:07:24.106 --> 01:07:25.467]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:07:26.247 --> 01:07:27.890]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:30.474]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:07:30.474 --> 01:07:31.776]  These are all parasites.
[01:07:31.776 --> 01:07:32.877]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:07:32.877 --> 01:07:34.219]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:07:34.219 --> 01:07:38.746]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:07:38.746 --> 01:07:41.891]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:45.055]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:07:45.055 --> 01:07:46.096]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:07:46.096 --> 01:07:48.039]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:48.039 --> 01:07:49.060]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:51.764]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:07:51.764 --> 01:07:55.028]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:55.028 --> 01:07:57.291]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:07:57.291 --> 01:07:59.234]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:08:15.131 --> 01:08:19.835]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:08:19.835 --> 01:08:21.516]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:08:21.516 --> 01:08:23.157]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:23.157 --> 01:08:28.721]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:28.721 --> 01:08:30.523]  And we're doing it!
[01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:42.672]  You know, Twitter began massively publicly censoring conservatives in the last two days, kicking them off, taking their verified status away, restricting how people can even share their tweets, and so their stock is plunging.
[01:08:43.615 --> 01:08:47.437]  But Facebook's starting to censor more, Google is censoring more.
[01:08:47.437 --> 01:08:54.201]  Again, I go back to this because Joe Rogan has the number one comedy show on iTunes and other platforms in the world.
[01:08:54.201 --> 01:09:02.046]  He's in the top ten, you know, hosted three or four major shows on Comedy Central, UFC host, movie star, TV star, you name it.
[01:09:02.046 --> 01:09:08.090]  Everything from Fear Factor to, you know, movies he does with all the big top comedians.
[01:09:09.731 --> 01:09:13.212]  And he said, no, hands down, this is the biggest thing I've ever done.
[01:09:13.212 --> 01:09:15.633]  This podcast with you is just everywhere.
[01:09:15.633 --> 01:09:18.754]  People on the street, all over the place.
[01:09:18.754 --> 01:09:20.835]  It's going to end up, it's like 40 something million right now.
[01:09:20.835 --> 01:09:26.177]  It's going to end up being a hundred million, probably by the end of the month.
[01:09:26.177 --> 01:09:34.620]  And they've just delisted it from all the major trending sites where you can't see that it's the number one thing in the world.
[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:35.861]  Let me explain something.
[01:09:35.861 --> 01:09:39.022]  If it's had 40 plus million views on seven different platforms,
[01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:41.390]  It's four hours long.
[01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:43.191]  It's like three hours and 45 minutes long.
[01:09:43.191 --> 01:09:45.272]  Unprecedented to have that many views on something that long.
[01:09:45.272 --> 01:09:46.572]  Because they have an algorithm.
[01:09:46.572 --> 01:09:49.513]  They don't just let you watch five minutes and call it a viewer.
[01:09:49.513 --> 01:09:53.135]  That's a lot of people watching something longer than the Super Bowl.
[01:09:53.135 --> 01:09:57.296]  The Super Bowl has 80 million people.
[01:09:57.296 --> 01:09:58.997]  Billions are made on it.
[01:09:58.997 --> 01:10:05.919]  I go do a podcast and it's going to have 100 million people by the end of the month, the trends show.
[01:10:05.919 --> 01:10:08.380]  It's already the biggest podcast ever.
[01:10:10.845 --> 01:10:23.209]  But wait, Paul Watson, so far in the last seven days, has 18 plus million views on my Facebook video page alone.
[01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:26.970]  18 million!
[01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:28.050]  Let's say it again.
[01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:29.871]  Go look.
[01:10:29.871 --> 01:10:36.893]  18 million views of Paul Watson's five videos.
[01:10:38.183 --> 01:10:40.825]  Then you go to his channel, there's tens of millions more.
[01:10:40.825 --> 01:10:42.726]  You go to the YouTube, millions more.
[01:10:42.726 --> 01:10:44.467]  It's a joke!
[01:10:44.467 --> 01:10:49.751]  That's why, again, I'm not up here announcing, I'm big, I'm the greatest, I'm the best.
[01:10:49.751 --> 01:10:54.154]  It's this weird paradox of you want the truth, you're hungry for it.
[01:10:54.154 --> 01:10:55.956]  The leftists that listen to Joe's show.
[01:10:56.983 --> 01:11:00.244]  I'd say about 60% are what you call liberals, but well-meaning ones.
[01:11:00.244 --> 01:11:06.826]  They're all, I love Alex Jones now, I never, I always believe lies about him or stuff out of context, I agree with this, this is crazy!
[01:11:06.826 --> 01:11:09.486]  And he's had more podcasts with big guests.
[01:11:09.486 --> 01:11:15.768]  They're like, I actually like Alex Jones, why I heard it and I couldn't believe it, it all made sense.
[01:11:15.768 --> 01:11:17.829]  That's what happens.
[01:11:17.829 --> 01:11:22.350]  They've had the New York Times three times in the last three days attack me in big stories.
[01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:24.831]  Washington Post two times.
[01:11:24.831 --> 01:11:25.973]  Again, I'm not bragging.
[01:11:25.973 --> 01:11:28.615]  This isn't Alex Jones' head got big.
[01:11:28.615 --> 01:11:30.037]  It's we're killing them.
[01:11:30.037 --> 01:11:31.959]  You're killing them.
[01:11:31.959 --> 01:11:32.859]  You heard that intro.
[01:11:32.859 --> 01:11:33.840]  We're going to stop tyranny.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.502]  We're going to take America back.
[01:11:35.502 --> 01:11:43.790]  That intro is 19 years old.
[01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:45.292]  It wasn't some overnight success.
[01:11:47.288 --> 01:11:48.209]  I am completely humbled.
[01:11:48.209 --> 01:11:50.771]  This broadcast is our team, it's you, it's everybody together.
[01:11:50.771 --> 01:11:53.453]  And obviously it was Joe Rogan's audience and my audience coming together.
[01:11:53.453 --> 01:11:58.277]  The point is, is that it wasn't about left or right.
[01:11:58.277 --> 01:12:04.942]  I went on his show and was real with people for almost four hours and it's got like a 97% positive upvote on YouTube.
[01:12:10.063 --> 01:12:12.365]  Joe's never had anything that positive.
[01:12:12.365 --> 01:12:13.946]  I mean, he's had stuff close.
[01:12:13.946 --> 01:12:18.889]  Because you put two dominant winners together who are both into freedom, it's explosive.
[01:12:18.889 --> 01:12:21.070]  It's like putting uranium and plutonium together.
[01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:23.972]  There's going to be an explosion.
[01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:26.834]  But everywhere, they game it.
[01:12:26.834 --> 01:12:27.715]  They throttle it back.
[01:12:27.715 --> 01:12:29.416]  They have throttles at key points.
[01:12:29.416 --> 01:12:33.679]  When it's peaking, they just throttle it where you can't see it, or suddenly it's not available, or
[01:12:35.409 --> 01:12:37.351]  And notice, I've always said they're governing stuff.
[01:12:37.351 --> 01:12:38.592]  They're throttling it back.
[01:12:38.592 --> 01:12:44.058]  Now, Twitter admits, oh, we're throttling back the conservative viral news.
[01:12:44.058 --> 01:12:46.540]  Oh, they still let you tweet.
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:48.622]  It just has 1% of the effect and goes into a black hole.
[01:12:48.622 --> 01:12:56.009]  It's like taking a, you know, people that are trying to protest, take them to a free speech zone four miles away from the actual event.
[01:12:56.009 --> 01:12:59.453]  Yeah, you can yell and scream all you want here in this free speech zone, but nobody can hear you.
[01:13:00.418 --> 01:13:02.138]  People say, well, don't you dislike protesters?
[01:13:02.138 --> 01:13:03.119]  I love protesters!
[01:13:03.119 --> 01:13:03.679]  Free speech!
[01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:06.419]  Go out and have your speech heard!
[01:13:06.419 --> 01:13:11.640]  Don't go attack me, or shoot a cop in the back, because George Soros funded you.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:18.322]  So I'm gonna go to your phone calls right now, but there's so much to get to, but the Twitter police are openly targeting conservatives.
[01:13:18.322 --> 01:13:24.903]  They're going now from denying they were doing this, to doing it.
[01:13:24.903 --> 01:13:25.423]  And it's on.
[01:13:25.423 --> 01:13:28.004]  Okay, let me read you a few headlines that are coming up, then I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:13:29.099 --> 01:13:31.440]  Some of this already covered, but a lot of it I haven't.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:32.761]  Trump to Drudge.
[01:13:32.761 --> 01:13:35.023]  Phenomenal tax cut package coming in two to three weeks.
[01:13:35.023 --> 01:13:36.884]  Responds to Drudge in hours.
[01:13:36.884 --> 01:13:40.206]  Drudge, Republican Party should be sued for fraud.
[01:13:40.206 --> 01:13:41.207]  Absolutely.
[01:13:41.207 --> 01:13:43.688]  Bunch of George Soros scum.
[01:13:43.688 --> 01:13:45.769]  In fact, where's my George Soros article?
[01:13:45.769 --> 01:13:48.291]  Nico brought that in during the break.
[01:13:48.291 --> 01:13:49.472]  I'll just go to your phone calls.
[01:13:49.472 --> 01:13:50.512]  I've got hundreds of articles.
[01:13:50.512 --> 01:13:53.514]  It's just insane.
[01:13:53.514 --> 01:13:55.776]  Gives me a headache.
[01:13:55.776 --> 01:13:57.657]  I'm trying to get back in really good shape, and I did.
[01:13:58.922 --> 01:14:03.323]  Like 30 pull-ups last Friday.
[01:14:03.323 --> 01:14:05.464]  I made myself.
[01:14:05.464 --> 01:14:08.364]  Because I can do pull-ups, even though I'm big.
[01:14:08.364 --> 01:14:12.045]  And, oh, it just knocked my neck out into my back.
[01:14:12.045 --> 01:14:15.987]  And I am just, I'm a little bit of, it's just really annoying.
[01:14:15.987 --> 01:14:17.067]  Oh, man.
[01:14:17.067 --> 01:14:17.807]  Anyway, so there it is.
[01:14:17.807 --> 01:14:18.847]  Backstabbers.
[01:14:18.847 --> 01:14:24.869]  Paul Ryan, Lindsey Graham, John McCain, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush took campaign cash from Soros.
[01:14:24.869 --> 01:14:25.209]  Go read it.
[01:14:26.721 --> 01:14:27.362]  It's public!
[01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:29.444]  It's, it's... Oh, fake news!
[01:14:29.444 --> 01:14:29.904]  Fake news!
[01:14:29.904 --> 01:14:30.365]  Oh yeah, really?
[01:14:30.365 --> 01:14:32.707]  We're just showing you the Federal Elections Commission.
[01:14:32.707 --> 01:14:33.888]  It's a fact!
[01:14:33.888 --> 01:14:37.112]  And you know it's true, to quote Sammy Hagar.
[01:14:37.112 --> 01:14:42.257]  Then coming up... Kremlin confirms accidental Russian airstrike kills Turkish soldiers in Syria.
[01:14:44.252 --> 01:14:47.014]  Alleged gang rape shown on Facebook shocks Sweden.
[01:14:47.014 --> 01:14:50.055]  We have one of the journalists coming on that's going to detail it.
[01:14:50.055 --> 01:14:52.417]  Wikipedia bans unreliable daily mail as source.
[01:14:52.417 --> 01:14:53.897]  Why don't they ban themselves?
[01:14:53.897 --> 01:14:56.899]  Most government workers should be replaced by robots, new study finds.
[01:14:56.899 --> 01:15:03.863]  Instead, the government workers have decided to replace our jobs, at least in socialist countries like France and China, with the robots.
[01:15:03.863 --> 01:15:06.304]  Intel to invest $7 billion in a factory in Arizona.
[01:15:06.304 --> 01:15:08.105]  Employ 3,000 because of Trump.
[01:15:08.105 --> 01:15:08.606]  CNBC.
[01:15:09.898 --> 01:15:14.039]  Report CNN caught handing out questions at Cruz-Sanders debate.
[01:15:14.039 --> 01:15:14.699]  Of course they did.
[01:15:14.699 --> 01:15:19.861]  Brazzers porn site blocked in Russia for negative influence on human psyche.
[01:15:19.861 --> 01:15:22.721]  You can say, hey don't block porn, that blocks free speech.
[01:15:22.721 --> 01:15:25.722]  Okay, well you're going to block news saying it's fake.
[01:15:25.722 --> 01:15:31.844]  The Russians can then block porn, because that's a lot more reasonable.
[01:15:31.844 --> 01:15:32.504]  I mean, let me tell you.
[01:15:34.124 --> 01:15:37.266]  Porn ain't what it was back in the 1980s, I'm here to tell you.
[01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:41.029]  I mean, it is... I've gone, I've looked at it, and it's like, what the hell is this?
[01:15:41.029 --> 01:15:46.012]  I mean, this is what kids have access to in many areas of the country and the world?
[01:15:46.012 --> 01:15:53.597]  This is not sex, this is not love, this is, uh... Dehumanization.
[01:15:53.597 --> 01:15:55.398]  And the globalists admit that's the plan.
[01:15:55.398 --> 01:16:00.902]  Germany, asylum seeker arrested after abusing 18 women during two-hour train journey.
[01:16:00.902 --> 01:16:02.143]  Because that's what you do to women!
[01:16:03.336 --> 01:16:08.438]  I think we have a guest coming up to break all that down from Europe.
[01:16:08.438 --> 01:16:18.201]  Other big articles out today dealing with science we're gonna be getting to, but right now we've got Miranda, Todd, Josh, Terry, Jake and others.
[01:16:18.201 --> 01:16:22.462]  Let's go to the great state of Michigan and talk to Miranda here on the air.
[01:16:22.462 --> 01:16:25.343]  Hello.
[01:16:25.343 --> 01:16:27.264]  Yes ma'am, go ahead.
[01:16:27.264 --> 01:16:29.624]  Hi Alex, I'm a big fan.
[01:16:29.624 --> 01:16:31.205]  I just wanted to say that
[01:16:31.969 --> 01:16:41.712]  It's really refreshing to see Trump telling it like it is and not all this fake stuff all the time like CNN.
[01:16:41.712 --> 01:16:46.014]  And I'm also pretty embarrassed for my generation.
[01:16:46.014 --> 01:16:47.575]  I'm 26.
[01:16:47.575 --> 01:16:54.257]  And like the people in the Women's March, they want to be a part of something, but they don't really know what's going on.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:05.264]  Well, they're out there supporting radical Islam and say put women under burkas because as long as it's anti-American, anti-Western, they love it.
[01:17:05.264 --> 01:17:05.944]  I mean, that's what they are.
[01:17:05.944 --> 01:17:07.444]  They're not pro-women.
[01:17:07.444 --> 01:17:09.785]  They're in a cuck cult.
[01:17:09.785 --> 01:17:12.647]  So, that's what they're doing.
[01:17:12.647 --> 01:17:13.967]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:17:13.967 --> 01:17:18.269]  But look, Trump is, even though I disagree with Sessions on this whole marijuana war,
[01:17:19.753 --> 01:17:24.279]  I don't really smoke marijuana, but the point is, I mean, I smoke it every once in a while to test it out, literally.
[01:17:24.279 --> 01:17:31.609]  I don't like the way it makes me feel, but I've smoked marijuana every once in a while, and it's like I'll be at a party or something, and I'm like, yeah, let me see the state of marijuana.
[01:17:31.609 --> 01:17:33.011]  I'm like, whoa, that is strong.
[01:17:33.011 --> 01:17:34.393]  So I can come on here and talk about how strong it is.
[01:17:34.633 --> 01:17:37.215]  I don't think Sessions should be spoken about, but it has a lot of medical reasons.
[01:17:37.215 --> 01:17:39.736]  It has a lot of things for glaucoma, you name it.
[01:17:39.736 --> 01:17:41.538]  It's an amazing plant God gave us.
[01:17:41.538 --> 01:17:44.620]  So I don't think Sessions should be on this big war on drug kick.
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:51.464]  But he's so honorable when it comes to law and prosecuting criminals and going after government corruption and defending our sovereignty.
[01:17:51.464 --> 01:17:54.866]  It's refreshing because he really means what he's doing.
[01:17:54.866 --> 01:17:56.968]  And you know, he's a noble person.
[01:17:56.968 --> 01:18:00.890]  So even though I disagree with Trump, like I said, on torture, at least he's being honest about it.
[01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:02.451]  Go ahead.
[01:18:02.451 --> 01:18:02.691]  Great.
[01:18:05.248 --> 01:18:13.992]  I grew up listening to you, honestly, and it's so frustrating to watch CNN every night and just hear, like, lie after lie after lie.
[01:18:13.992 --> 01:18:22.156]  And it's like, I just wish that somebody would tell the truth and finally Trump comes around and it's like, yes, finally!
[01:18:22.156 --> 01:18:24.177]  It's like a breath of fresh air, isn't it?
[01:18:24.177 --> 01:18:27.979]  It's like being underwater and you're dying for oxygen and you finally hit the surface.
[01:18:27.979 --> 01:18:29.039]  How old are you, Miranda? 26.
[01:18:30.962 --> 01:18:33.523]  Alright, well thank you and God bless you for calling in and listening.
[01:18:33.523 --> 01:18:34.424]  Please keep spreading the word.
[01:18:34.424 --> 01:18:37.345]  The real power is you spreading the word.
[01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:38.566]  It's like wildfire.
[01:18:38.566 --> 01:18:40.086]  It's unstoppable.
[01:18:40.086 --> 01:18:42.567]  Josh in Colorado, up there in the Rockies.
[01:18:42.567 --> 01:18:43.428]  You're on the air, Josh.
[01:18:44.642 --> 01:18:47.324]  Hey Alex, I've been listening 10 years now.
[01:18:47.324 --> 01:18:48.465]  Big fan.
[01:18:48.465 --> 01:18:50.747]  I want to talk about the tax cuts.
[01:18:50.747 --> 01:19:00.876]  You know, I've been working on getting out of debt for about 10 years now, and I'd be out of debt by now if I wouldn't lose a third of my check to the government for forced health care and all the taxes.
[01:19:00.876 --> 01:19:02.437]  And I'm like an independent inventor.
[01:19:02.437 --> 01:19:09.323]  I've been trying to invent some stuff for Tesla technology, but I can't get the government off my head, you know?
[01:19:09.323 --> 01:19:10.043]  It's driving me crazy.
[01:19:10.043 --> 01:19:11.565]  Big corporations lobby.
[01:19:12.465 --> 01:19:27.342]  Well, I led a movement in 2012 called the Million Volt March, and I had so many backstabbers coming at me doing this march, and, you know, it's hard out there.
[01:19:33.567 --> 01:19:43.952]  There's a low-level dispersion system of kind of losers in any political system that are kind of there at the low level that feel like they're failures.
[01:19:43.952 --> 01:19:47.694]  So they try to glom onto anything low-level and bring it down or take control of it.
[01:19:47.694 --> 01:19:57.738]  You have to learn to never even talk about them and what happened to you when you try to do something good and just move forward, never giving the failure any attention.
[01:19:57.738 --> 01:20:00.039]  I'm gonna give people the big secret on the other side, okay?
[01:20:00.039 --> 01:20:00.460]  The big one.
[01:20:01.547 --> 01:20:02.648]  Think about this.
[01:20:02.648 --> 01:20:15.238]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[01:20:15.238 --> 01:20:19.262]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[01:20:19.502 --> 01:20:23.307]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey Water Filter.

[01:20:43.648 --> 01:20:44.368]  Big Berkey.

[01:21:01.502 --> 01:21:04.843]  Why be held hostage by your wireless carrier for two years?

[01:21:58.619 --> 01:21:59.660]  Come and take it!
[01:22:01.428 --> 01:22:03.370]  Hi there, Dick Allgaier here.
[01:22:03.370 --> 01:22:07.733]  I was a mainstream television news reporter for over three decades.
[01:22:07.733 --> 01:22:11.216]  I normally never do commercial endorsements.
[01:22:11.216 --> 01:22:13.898]  I am very skeptical of health supplements.
[01:22:13.898 --> 01:22:18.001]  But a friend of mine told me about his experience with Synergy One.
[01:22:18.001 --> 01:22:22.365]  So I purchased a bottle and my wife and I have been using it for a few weeks now.
[01:22:22.705 --> 01:22:25.726]  I very much dislike so-called energy boosters.
[01:22:25.726 --> 01:22:31.489]  Those little energy drinks that have caffeine and guarana and other things that make your heart race.
[01:22:31.489 --> 01:22:32.589]  This is not that.
[01:22:32.589 --> 01:22:35.850]  My experience with Synergy One has been great.
[01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:37.111]  My mood is better.
[01:22:37.111 --> 01:22:38.311]  My joints feel better.
[01:22:38.311 --> 01:22:43.053]  I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased productivity.
[01:22:43.053 --> 01:22:46.655]  My wife and I both noticed that we even dream more.
[01:22:46.655 --> 01:22:48.656]  So I recommend Synergy One.
[01:22:48.656 --> 01:22:49.736]  It's really good stuff.
[01:22:49.736 --> 01:22:51.517]  I'm having great results with it.
[01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:57.316]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.

[01:23:05.521 --> 01:23:08.563]  I couldn't let Valentine's Day come and go without surprising you with flowers.
[01:23:08.943 --> 01:23:10.244]  Aw, thank you!

[01:24:20.163 --> 01:24:21.864]  Okay.
[01:24:21.864 --> 01:24:24.824]  So, there's different types of people that get politically involved.
[01:24:24.824 --> 01:24:26.625]  A lot of folks get involved because...
[01:24:28.015 --> 01:24:37.220]  They're truly angry at their Second Amendment being taken, or their jobs being taken, or they've been pushed around by, you know, zoning departments that are under U.N.
[01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:44.283]  auspices, like NextCode and CodeNext, all the rest of the Jena 21 garbage.
[01:24:44.283 --> 01:24:57.470]  But then you get out there on the street with activists, there's going to be schizophrenics, there's going to be mentally ill people, there'll be a small percentage, but there's going to be government provocateurs, but more importantly, foundation provocateurs,
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:02.203]  Trying to stir up fights and weirdness.
[01:25:02.203 --> 01:25:09.488]  And so, people that start websites or start YouTube channels, trolls will come by and say, your mother's a murderer.
[01:25:09.488 --> 01:25:14.392]  Wanting to see if they can get you in a fight with them, or hurt your feelings, or have power over you.
[01:25:14.392 --> 01:25:21.898]  They have bots that do this as well, that will then be on both sides saying, I hate white people, I hate black people, or I hate Hispanic people.
[01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:24.811]  Just to get a fight going on.
[01:25:24.811 --> 01:25:26.651]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:25:26.651 --> 01:25:28.552]  They've got all these different computer programs that do it.
[01:25:28.552 --> 01:25:32.814]  Soros spent hundreds of millions in the last few years on this.
[01:25:32.814 --> 01:25:34.634]  That's in the news.
[01:25:34.634 --> 01:25:35.555]  That's just Soros.
[01:25:35.555 --> 01:25:37.775]  There's scores of big foundations.
[01:25:37.775 --> 01:25:44.558]  So, the secret isn't Oprah Winfrey's just believe something, you know, pray to the universe and it's going to happen.
[01:25:44.558 --> 01:25:49.280]  You're not going to pray for a Taj Mahal to pop up, you know, in your backyard and then it just happens.
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:50.360]  You've got to own the property.
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:51.341]  You've got to have the will.
[01:25:51.341 --> 01:25:51.981]  You've got to have the
[01:25:53.530 --> 01:26:01.856]  Again, but believing in something and believing in something that's good and taking action and working with others, that can manifest itself over time.
[01:26:01.856 --> 01:26:03.237]  Humans are made in the image of God.
[01:26:03.237 --> 01:26:05.278]  We can create things.
[01:26:05.278 --> 01:26:11.222]  But if you want to talk about free energy or talk about things that are being suppressed, just talk about that.
[01:26:11.222 --> 01:26:14.985]  Don't talk about, oh, I tried all this and they were backstabbers and everything.
[01:26:14.985 --> 01:26:15.625]  Move on.
[01:26:15.625 --> 01:26:16.646]  Just forget that energy.
[01:26:17.944 --> 01:26:19.685]  I mean, people all the time say, how are you taking it?
[01:26:19.685 --> 01:26:23.468]  You got attacked in a hundred newspapers yesterday and I heard them on NPR saying lies.
[01:26:23.468 --> 01:26:27.070]  They're the scum, they're the liars, I'm very proud of it.
[01:26:27.070 --> 01:26:31.213]  People that know they're discredited scum are going to know I must be good.
[01:26:31.213 --> 01:26:34.035]  We better check Alex Jones out.
[01:26:34.035 --> 01:26:36.776]  So I don't really spend my time responding, but to 1% of it.
[01:26:36.776 --> 01:26:42.840]  And when I do respond, it's to educate people about their lies and how they operate, not about me.
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:46.063]  So the biggest thing of being an activist is have your issues,
[01:26:47.156 --> 01:27:05.800]  Move forward, and when weirdos show up and project their own stuff on you, or show up and want you to end fight with them, or, you know, let's say you've got a former employee that doesn't want to work, and then they're gone, and then to make themselves sound good, you know, they talk trash about you and make stuff up.
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:07.921]  That's what losers do!
[01:27:07.921 --> 01:27:10.421]  Move on as a winner, okay?
[01:27:10.421 --> 01:27:12.622]  And then let the dead bury the dead politically.
[01:27:15.313 --> 01:27:19.194]  Again, political movements aren't going to happen overnight.
[01:27:19.194 --> 01:27:26.997]  What you should do is start a blog, make it interesting, take photos, interview people, care about things, and then don't just be ready to be a victim.
[01:27:26.997 --> 01:27:34.680]  This whole social justice warrior thing is about being a victim, and people were mean to you, or things didn't go well, or you failed.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:42.043]  Instead of, if you're promoting real tenants of freedom, it isn't even about the money or fame you get from it, it's about changing things, and you will change things.
[01:27:42.043 --> 01:27:42.723]  You have power.
[01:27:44.451 --> 01:27:50.457]  So if you want to promote new forms of energy, let's talk about new forms of energy they're suppressing.
[01:27:50.457 --> 01:27:54.921]  I think the caller hung up from Colorado.
[01:27:54.921 --> 01:27:56.342]  He hung up.
[01:27:56.342 --> 01:27:59.985]  And by the way, I wasn't criticizing the caller.
[01:27:59.985 --> 01:28:06.071]  It's just that the reason InfoWars has been so successful is I never was involved in infighting.
[01:28:07.546 --> 01:28:21.733]  All these people, for their own mental illnesses, their own modern problems, their own idiosyncrasies, would always, in radio and TV and media and internet, would want to dominate me because they wanted to be the top fish.
[01:28:21.733 --> 01:28:22.713]  Or the top gorilla.
[01:28:22.713 --> 01:28:27.195]  You know, the guy on top of the pile.
[01:28:27.195 --> 01:28:29.996]  I wanted to stop the New World Order.
[01:28:29.996 --> 01:28:31.077]  I don't care about being number one.
[01:28:32.273 --> 01:28:49.786]  And so I would never divert myself into all the infighting and weirdness, because somebody tuning into talk radio, hearing talk show hosts fighting with each other and people threatening each other and weird crap, that may play to a few weird mentally ill trolls that listen, but it doesn't play to the general audience that wants freedom.
[01:28:49.786 --> 01:28:59.673]  So you resonate towards the intelligent, the informed, the spiritual, the involved, the enlightened, the people that want to affect change, the people that want to build a better world.
[01:28:59.673 --> 01:29:00.414]  That's the big secret.
[01:29:01.087 --> 01:29:03.028]  And if you do that, you'll change the world.
[01:29:03.028 --> 01:29:08.491]  We got Jack in Washington, we'll talk about Trump Judge, Travelman, and what's going on on college campuses.
[01:29:08.491 --> 01:29:16.636]  We've also got Todd, we'll talk about Trump, Obama, NDAA, CIA going over the media, State of the Union in danger, current events.
[01:29:16.636 --> 01:29:17.917]  Natasha's been holding a while.
[01:29:17.917 --> 01:29:21.559]  We'll go to Natasha as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:29:21.559 --> 01:29:24.481]  But I'll go to your calls early, straight ahead.
[01:29:24.481 --> 01:29:28.944]  But first, David Brock to work with the federal government to try to censor the media.
[01:29:29.858 --> 01:29:31.699]  But I thought President Trump was the new president.
[01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:33.560]  He's not in full control, folks.
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.761]  We've got to make him and others aware of it.
[01:29:35.761 --> 01:29:42.125]  That's what we do as watchmen and women on the wall, as modern 21st century Paul Reveres.
[01:29:42.125 --> 01:29:43.005]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:43.005 --> 01:29:44.346]  They hate the website.
[01:29:44.346 --> 01:29:45.967]  Infowars.com.
[01:29:45.967 --> 01:29:47.227]  Spread that link.
[01:29:47.227 --> 01:29:50.849]  Spread those stories.
[01:29:50.849 --> 01:29:52.250]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:54.791]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.791 --> 01:29:57.473]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.397 --> 01:30:12.268]  National Defense Labs and Citizen Armor has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people the true next generation in body armor.
[01:30:12.268 --> 01:30:20.035]  Basically what we're bringing to the InfoWars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[01:30:20.035 --> 01:30:25.981]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[01:30:26.041 --> 01:30:32.225]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[01:30:32.225 --> 01:30:33.206]  What did they really say about it?
[01:30:33.206 --> 01:30:35.027]  They want to know how do they get it?
[01:30:35.027 --> 01:30:36.048]  Where do they find it?
[01:30:36.048 --> 01:30:39.770]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:42.692]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[01:30:42.692 --> 01:30:44.553]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:30:44.553 --> 01:30:45.574]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[01:30:45.574 --> 01:30:46.715]  It's got a 20-year warranty.
[01:30:46.715 --> 01:30:47.395]  It's waterproof.
[01:30:47.395 --> 01:30:47.856]  You can wear it.
[01:30:47.856 --> 01:30:48.556]  It's comfortable.
[01:30:48.556 --> 01:30:50.657]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[01:30:50.657 --> 01:30:55.160]  Again, fund the info or get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes.
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:55.801]  It's a win-win.
[01:30:56.901 --> 01:30:56.962]  $200!
[01:30:56.962 --> 01:31:00.183]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:00.183 --> 01:31:01.004]  It's amazing!
[01:31:01.004 --> 01:31:03.865]  I'm a truck driver from Missouri.
[01:31:03.865 --> 01:31:06.627]  For 13 hours a night, I sit in my truck and I drive.
[01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:08.228]  Out of boredom, I'll stop and eat.
[01:31:08.228 --> 01:31:11.950]  If I'm not doing fast food, I guarantee there's a bag of chips open on my dashboard.
[01:31:11.950 --> 01:31:13.711]  That was all until Andro 400.
[01:31:13.711 --> 01:31:18.353]  I started out four months ago and since taking Andro 400, I have dropped 45 pounds.
[01:31:18.353 --> 01:31:19.254]  I'm sleeping better.
[01:31:19.254 --> 01:31:20.034]  There's no cravings.
[01:31:20.254 --> 01:31:21.956]  I actually don't even think about food.
[01:31:21.956 --> 01:31:23.477]  My knee pain went away.
[01:31:23.477 --> 01:31:30.204]  I've had some lower back issues and I've noticed that that went away and I can only contribute that to Andro 400.
[01:31:30.204 --> 01:31:33.628]  One thing that Andro 400 said on the radio ad is that it attacks belly fat.
[01:31:33.628 --> 01:31:34.849]  Well, let me tell you it did.
[01:31:34.849 --> 01:31:39.914]  The second month is where I saw a drastic change in the size of my stomach.
[01:31:39.914 --> 01:31:41.155]  I've lost six inches.
[01:31:41.155 --> 01:31:42.497]  This product really does work.
[01:31:42.757 --> 01:31:48.059]  So guys, if you'd like to experience similar results, then get Andro 400.
[01:31:48.059 --> 01:31:52.281]  The safe, natural, and inexpensive way to boost your testosterone.
[01:31:52.281 --> 01:31:54.101]  Go to andro400.com or call 888-400-0435.
[01:31:54.101 --> 01:31:54.141]  888-400-0435.
[01:32:01.184 --> 01:32:03.746]  Don't become dependent on the medical system.
[01:32:03.746 --> 01:32:06.388]  Get and stay healthy naturally with XtendoVite.
[01:32:06.388 --> 01:32:10.350]  Metals in the liver cause peroxides to get dumped into the bloodstream.
[01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:21.338]  Peroxides do more damage than free radicals to the arteries, and the LDL has no protection from peroxides, causing the LDL to get stuck in the arteries, creating a potential blockage.
[01:32:21.778 --> 01:32:30.183]  Xtendivite slowly chelates the metals away from the liver so it can dispose of what was meant to be a harmless process, peroxide.
[01:32:30.183 --> 01:32:35.086]  Xtendivite's 7 herbs has a job to strengthen the organs and circulatory highway.
[01:32:35.086 --> 01:32:36.747]  Can you afford a heart attack?
[01:32:36.747 --> 01:32:42.210]  Xtendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a 2 month supply.
[01:32:42.210 --> 01:32:43.531]  To get started, call 1-877-928-8822.
[01:32:43.531 --> 01:32:43.911]  That's 1-877-928-8822.

[01:33:11.084 --> 01:33:22.753]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:22.753 --> 01:33:28.298]  President Trump came out over the weekend and said the media is covering up, whitewashing and underreporting Islamic terror.
[01:33:28.298 --> 01:33:30.640]  The media had to say, well we reported on most of these.
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:33.262]  Yeah, you didn't report on some and you underreported on others.
[01:33:33.262 --> 01:33:36.804]  And they ordered the Department of Homeland Security going back seven years ago
[01:33:37.799 --> 01:33:41.662]  To stop using the word Islamic terror, and the media stopped using the term.
[01:33:41.662 --> 01:33:47.245]  So you didn't just censor that it was happening, you censored what it was.
[01:33:47.245 --> 01:33:53.149]  That'd be like in World War II, you know, don't call Nazi invasion of North Africa Nazi.
[01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:55.491]  What are you supposed to call it then?
[01:33:55.491 --> 01:34:02.375]  So, the media is just ridiculous, and Trump beautifully trolled them into then wall-to-wall coverage of Islamic terror.
[01:34:02.375 --> 01:34:05.478]  But they're also in Europe censoring the Islamic rape brigades,
[01:34:06.757 --> 01:34:13.744]  Again, gang rape shown on Facebook, shocks Sweden, Germany, African migrants sexually assaults 18 women on a two hour train ride.
[01:34:13.744 --> 01:34:15.366]  Just the men just sit there and let them do it.
[01:34:15.366 --> 01:34:20.110]  You talk about cuckold, broken back, politically correct men.
[01:34:20.110 --> 01:34:23.173]  I see somebody sexually assaulting women, I am going to stop.
[01:34:23.173 --> 01:34:26.196]  I don't care if you're 6 foot 8, you are going to get assaulted.
[01:34:27.588 --> 01:34:29.070]  It's not because I'm Mr. Badass, man.
[01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:29.830]  I got daughters.
[01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:31.132]  I mean, I love women.
[01:34:31.132 --> 01:34:32.794]  I'm gonna hurt you bad.
[01:34:32.794 --> 01:34:33.855]  Or die trying.
[01:34:33.855 --> 01:34:35.536]  People, oh, listen to that macho talk.
[01:34:35.536 --> 01:34:37.619]  What the hell are you talking about?
[01:34:37.619 --> 01:34:39.220]  Look what we've done in the Info War.
[01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:40.161]  Where are the men?
[01:34:40.161 --> 01:34:41.643]  People said, why'd you do all this?
[01:34:41.643 --> 01:34:43.044]  Because they were trying to destroy the country.
[01:34:43.044 --> 01:34:46.128]  And I knew that in the future, war was information war.
[01:34:46.128 --> 01:34:47.189]  We built the Info War.
[01:34:49.738 --> 01:34:50.378]  Where are the men?
[01:34:50.378 --> 01:34:52.459]  I just, I don't even know what species this is.
[01:34:52.459 --> 01:34:54.900]  I've got stacks of these just today that have come in.
[01:34:54.900 --> 01:35:01.942]  We've got reporter Salia Farber joining us to document this massive cover-up.
[01:35:01.942 --> 01:35:06.564]  And then in other news, we've just got so much incredible stuff here to be breaking down.
[01:35:07.779 --> 01:35:12.122]  Drudge comes out and says, listen, I don't want to hear that we're going to do a bunch of other stuff first.
[01:35:12.122 --> 01:35:13.983]  It's tax cuts on the poor and the middle class.
[01:35:13.983 --> 01:35:17.765]  All the top economists say, we're going into a recession slash depression.
[01:35:17.765 --> 01:35:20.827]  Never got out of the recession if we don't do this fast.
[01:35:20.827 --> 01:35:26.410]  And Trump responds within hours saying, yes, Drudge, I'm going to do it in the next three weeks.
[01:35:26.410 --> 01:35:29.252]  But meanwhile, Paul Ryan and people are running around getting Soros money.
[01:35:29.252 --> 01:35:32.474]  And that's the big story he broke on Infowars.com in the last few days.
[01:35:32.474 --> 01:35:35.356]  And also how there's this big tie-in.
[01:35:36.479 --> 01:35:41.522]  That's going on and taking place with Google and media matters.
[01:35:41.522 --> 01:35:59.654]  With this new office set up, the State Department, Trump's so busy with everything else that Brock is caught in a document bragging that they're going to be the group that the government consortium goes to, still, along with a mail order group out of Florida that does mail order diplomas.
[01:36:01.195 --> 01:36:06.821]  And Snopes, a lady, her cat and her husband, they will be the grand arbiters of who can have a website.
[01:36:06.821 --> 01:36:07.442]  And it's begun.
[01:36:07.442 --> 01:36:12.728]  Wikipedia has banned the Daily Mail that I found to be a super hardcore paper.
[01:36:12.728 --> 01:36:17.734]  And you've also got other reports with massive Twitter censorship increasing.
[01:36:17.734 --> 01:36:21.178]  So we'll talk about all that with Dr. Jerome Corsi and then I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[01:36:21.658 --> 01:36:35.258]  With Natasha and others that are patiently holding Dr. Jerome Corsi, three-time New York Times number one bestseller, investigative journalist, but really better known in circles and a friend of Trump for 40 plus years, in banking.
[01:36:36.127 --> 01:36:39.750]  And they met earlier last year and discussed the future.
[01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:42.293]  But the big thing here is they're trying to stall the economy.
[01:36:42.293 --> 01:36:44.114]  Goldman Sachs is announcing it.
[01:36:44.114 --> 01:36:45.736]  Bloomberg.
[01:36:45.736 --> 01:36:49.279]  They're all saying kill the economy, recession, hurt Trump.
[01:36:49.279 --> 01:36:49.979]  They're trying.
[01:36:49.979 --> 01:36:50.900]  It hasn't happened yet.
[01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:53.723]  But Trump knows he's in a race to turn the economy on.
[01:36:53.723 --> 01:36:58.107]  So as a Harvard economist and geopolitical scientist, that's really Courtesy's forte.
[01:36:58.107 --> 01:37:02.831]  So before we get into his big stories he broke about censorship and the rest of it and
[01:37:03.271 --> 01:37:05.354]  Well, I've been in Washington all this week, as you know, Alex.
[01:37:18.266 --> 01:37:18.726]  I don't know.
[01:37:43.576 --> 01:37:55.946]  The government be run by Ryan and McConnell, it's going to be completely a Democratic Party agenda of, you know, do nothing but slow down the economy, gradually grind it into a recession or depression.
[01:37:55.946 --> 01:38:00.530]  And, you know, thankfully Donald Trump, I don't think is going to stand for it.
[01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:04.514]  It's just hard to have the amount of subversion.
[01:38:05.154 --> 01:38:09.176]  That's in Washington of the President's agenda.
[01:38:09.176 --> 01:38:15.939]  Every place you turn, even within the White House, there are people working against President Trump.
[01:38:15.939 --> 01:38:21.821]  And let's be clear, it's like Gingrich running around saying we're not going to drain the swamp, and then Trump makes him go out and say that's not true.
[01:38:21.821 --> 01:38:26.583]  We have Ryan saying we're not going to have tax cuts until 2018, and then Trump says no we are.
[01:38:26.583 --> 01:38:28.004]  They're openly working against him.
[01:38:28.737 --> 01:38:28.957]  Right.
[01:38:28.957 --> 01:38:33.619]  I mean, I'm even suspicious here of Reince Priebus, who is, you know, the chief of staff.
[01:38:33.619 --> 01:38:42.662]  He's a Republican GOP establishment, and he's not going to root out of the State Department, you know, the thousand people who have signed this anti-Trump
[01:38:43.403 --> 01:38:43.844]  I think?
[01:39:02.626 --> 01:39:02.886]  We're good.
[01:39:30.675 --> 01:39:34.876]  Trump love-fest among themselves in the daily press briefing.
[01:39:34.876 --> 01:39:35.157]  That's right.
[01:39:35.157 --> 01:39:35.697]  Let's be clear.
[01:39:35.697 --> 01:39:53.283]  You have the Republican leadership funded by Soros, the Soros-funded Media Matters, the State Department bill that Obama signed two weeks before Trump got in to attack all of Trump's key base and free speech in America, and we can't even get Reince Priebus or anybody to talk about it or Sean Spicer.
[01:39:54.130 --> 01:40:01.532]  Right, and it's shocking, you know, this briefing book, and you're exactly right, that's what's going on within the White House.
[01:40:01.532 --> 01:40:13.716]  You've got the Republican establishment working against Trump, and it's shocking, this briefing book from David Brock, who I call the father of fake news, because the whole term was invented by Brock.
[01:40:14.216 --> 01:40:17.918]  And it was invented to work with Google and Facebook.
[01:40:17.918 --> 01:40:29.323]  And the document just lays it out, you know, chapter and verse, how news agencies that are not ideologically correct are going to be branded fake news.
[01:40:29.323 --> 01:40:42.930]  And then the effort is going to be made by the Google and Facebook to uncritically remove these websites from any ability to share in the ad revenue, to make sure that they're silenced,
[01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:46.493]  They're considered toxic, alt-right.
[01:40:46.493 --> 01:40:52.419]  These are the very internet ghettos Drudge warned of directly, you know, out of Nazi Germany history.
[01:40:52.419 --> 01:40:54.702]  This is literally so un-American.
[01:40:54.702 --> 01:40:56.483]  And thank God this document's leaked.
[01:40:56.483 --> 01:41:00.908]  This is them admitting it's about shutting down free speech and ideology, not fake news.
[01:41:00.908 --> 01:41:01.409]  It's incredible.
[01:41:02.536 --> 01:41:04.859]  And the whole term fake news is a meme.
[01:41:04.859 --> 01:41:07.161]  It's a narrative invented by Brock.
[01:41:07.161 --> 01:41:09.643]  He makes that very clear in this document.
[01:41:09.643 --> 01:41:18.932]  And his entire goal, he states it openly, is to take the air out of any group that would give legitimacy to the Trump administration.
[01:41:19.432 --> 01:41:24.995]  So InfoWars immediately is targeted for slow play in every possible way.
[01:41:24.995 --> 01:41:34.160]  And you know, Donald Trump, I don't think is yet fully aware of the extent to which Media Matters has dominated Google and Facebook, has penetrated
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:42.225]  Working with the mainstream media in the, you know, accredited press in the White House, and the same people sitting in the front rows always.
[01:41:42.225 --> 01:41:58.275]  And I think when Donald Trump realizes that this is a leftist David Brock attempt, and we see it now in this document, documented fully, to control the media in anti-Trump media, to control it despite Trump being president.
[01:41:58.775 --> 01:42:07.019]  And they control it from within by controlling the White House press office and doing everything possible to subvert efforts that Donald Trump launched.
[01:42:07.019 --> 01:42:16.083]  So Trump keeps wondering while the leaks are happening, a lot of the Republican leadership, Spicer, Ryan, all of them are directly plugged into this Google Brock operation.
[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:21.926]  Right, and the problem is you try to root it out.
[01:42:21.926 --> 01:42:23.549]  The State Department is a good example.
[01:42:23.549 --> 01:42:27.013]  You have 1,000 people resign, great.
[01:42:27.013 --> 01:42:31.799]  You've got 1,000 people who are still employed who are signing anti-Trump letters.
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:39.763]  If they don't want to do their jobs at the State Department, if they don't want to support the administration, you know, they should get out and Trump should fire them.
[01:42:39.763 --> 01:42:44.485]  But again, it's got to, Donald Trump's got to realize, and I'm confident he's going to wake up to it.
[01:42:44.485 --> 01:42:45.245]  He always does.
[01:42:45.245 --> 01:42:47.106]  I've known him for 40 years.
[01:42:47.106 --> 01:42:48.606]  He catches on.
[01:42:48.606 --> 01:43:00.111]  But you know, the degree of subversion that David Brock and this hard left inventing fake news and then targeting groups to be excluded
[01:43:01.192 --> 01:43:07.350]  This is truly an un-American, anti-free speech, authoritarian threat to all of us.
[01:43:08.274 --> 01:43:33.550]  Yes it is, and it can't be in the heart of the Trump administration where people are subverting the President's agenda, restricting access to the President, taking away his cell phone so he can't communicate with anyone who might be supporting him, allowing the anti-Trump mainstream media, and Brock makes no doubt about it.
[01:43:33.550 --> 01:43:36.972]  He says in this memorandum, this memorandum was never intended for the public.
[01:43:37.472 --> 01:43:38.392]  Only for his donors.
[01:43:38.392 --> 01:43:40.533]  It says confidential all over it.
[01:43:40.533 --> 01:43:50.135]  The goal is to deny the Trump administration legitimacy through targeting any news organizations, conservative, libertarian.
[01:43:50.135 --> 01:43:53.496]  This is a fifth column against America, against free speech.
[01:43:53.496 --> 01:43:54.716]  This is sedition.
[01:43:54.716 --> 01:43:55.917]  This isn't free speech.
[01:43:55.917 --> 01:43:57.757]  This is organized foreign money.
[01:43:57.757 --> 01:44:01.758]  Sorry, your sky's breaking up.
[01:44:01.758 --> 01:44:04.519]  This is organized, doctor, organized foreign money.
[01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:08.226]  Trying to openly come in and kill our First Amendment.
[01:44:08.226 --> 01:44:11.473]  This is an act of sabotage.
[01:44:11.473 --> 01:44:12.756]  This is an act of espionage.
[01:44:13.393 --> 01:44:35.504]  Right, and he's looking for, he's got 13 million dollars, he's putting out this proposal for more money, and he's looking for the hard left, wherever it comes from, in the United States, outside, he doesn't care, to fund Media Matters, to do systematic research and put websites, news agencies, media, like InfoWars, in the crosshairs of his sites,
[01:44:36.164 --> 01:44:51.574]  To say fake news, to smear, to pass information around, deny credentials, block out, marginalize any news agency that would dare to support the President's agenda.
[01:44:51.574 --> 01:45:04.241]  So the agenda could be totally dominated by media that is Brock approved, Google and Facebook allowed, to get past their censorship, and you get past their censorship by being anti-Trump.
[01:45:05.242 --> 01:45:08.524]  Trump is going to learn and is learning about this Trojan horse attack.
[01:45:08.524 --> 01:45:14.248]  So good luck, Brock, and good luck, Priebus.
[01:45:14.248 --> 01:45:20.792]  Dr. Corsi, let's shift gears as an economist into what's happening with... I mean, you've seen it there openly.
[01:45:20.792 --> 01:45:23.494]  I'm confident Donald Trump is going to realize this.
[01:45:23.494 --> 01:45:24.174]  Yeah.
[01:45:24.174 --> 01:45:28.337]  What's happening with your Skype is, Doc, is it's massively delayed.
[01:45:28.337 --> 01:45:30.598]  You're hearing my audio a lot later.
[01:45:30.598 --> 01:45:34.361]  So finish your point with Trump and then let's get into how they're trying to stall the economy.
[01:45:34.361 --> 01:45:34.601]  Go ahead.
[01:45:39.008 --> 01:45:48.412]  Yes, Skype's a wonderful thing, but let's reconnect with him real quick.
[01:45:48.412 --> 01:45:48.833]  Absolutely.
[01:45:48.833 --> 01:45:59.097]  Let's play a clip of Maxine Waters not knowing what planet she's on and thinking that Russia has called for... No, I know what it is.
[01:45:59.097 --> 01:45:59.638]  Thanks.
[01:45:59.638 --> 01:46:01.178]  They're telling me stuff.
[01:46:01.178 --> 01:46:01.459]  I get it.
[01:46:01.459 --> 01:46:02.319]  Thank you.
[01:46:02.319 --> 01:46:05.781]  Of course, Maxine Waters has come out and said that
[01:46:07.591 --> 01:46:12.115]  She believes Russia invaded Korea.
[01:46:12.115 --> 01:46:15.419]  And she also thinks a lot of other things.
[01:46:15.419 --> 01:46:17.541]  And now she's calling for the impeachment of Donald Trump.
[01:46:17.541 --> 01:46:17.881]  Here it is.
[01:46:26.782 --> 01:46:31.604]  Let's talk about the tweet that said your greatest desire was to lead Donald Trump right into impeachment.
[01:46:31.604 --> 01:46:34.965]  I think you've since said that he might do it himself.
[01:46:34.965 --> 01:46:43.448]  But in response to your statements, a White House official told NBC News this morning, I'm quoting here, minority leader Pelosi has already dismissed this extreme rhetoric.
[01:46:43.448 --> 01:46:49.850]  When San Francisco leftist representative Nancy Pelosi is the one trying to rein you in, you know you are out of touch.
[01:46:49.850 --> 01:46:52.911]  Between blocking the president's unquestionably qualified
[01:46:53.331 --> 01:46:55.072]  Congressman, what's your response to that?
[01:47:09.657 --> 01:47:15.561]  Well, my response is that they have created a response that is not credible.
[01:47:15.561 --> 01:47:20.825]  This is the most outrageous and ridiculous president that this country has ever had.
[01:47:20.825 --> 01:47:25.228]  He cannot be depended on for anything that he says.
[01:47:25.228 --> 01:47:33.995]  And so for them to try and pretend that somehow what I'm saying is outrageous and I've been reined in and all of that, there's no truth to that.
[01:47:34.375 --> 01:47:41.779]  As a matter of fact, all that Nancy Pelosi said was she was not ready yet to talk about impeachment.
[01:47:41.779 --> 01:47:44.621]  I'm ready to talk about it.
[01:47:44.621 --> 01:47:51.185]  You're also ready to say that Russia invaded Korea.
[01:47:51.185 --> 01:47:54.887]  You're also, Nancy Pelosi thinks that Bush stole an office, sweetheart.
[01:47:54.887 --> 01:47:57.668]  That was eight years ago, okay?
[01:47:57.668 --> 01:48:02.271]  And you know that what he's doing with the borders is something that presidents have done since Jimmy Carter.
[01:48:03.433 --> 01:48:08.214]  And before, but this bill is from Jimmy Carter's time.
[01:48:08.214 --> 01:48:15.035]  Now, I do want to take a few phone calls with Dr. Corsi and I want to ask him about where he sees the attack on the economy going.
[01:48:15.035 --> 01:48:23.617]  Clearly, I see the drumbeat in the financial papers and from Bloomberg and Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan telling their clients, get out of the market.
[01:48:23.617 --> 01:48:24.517]  The market's going down.
[01:48:24.517 --> 01:48:27.838]  We know Soros is betting against the markets, but he's been getting his
[01:48:29.076 --> 01:48:29.677]  Well, it's amazing.
[01:48:29.677 --> 01:48:35.801]  I mean, I again see in the, even in the Congress, I mean, you're talking about Ryan and McConnell saying, oh, no, no, we can't have tax cuts.
[01:48:49.841 --> 01:48:51.122]  We can't cut Medicare.
[01:49:13.523 --> 01:49:14.104]  We're good to go.
[01:49:31.576 --> 01:49:37.800]  Well, the problem is, we've got so many vested interests, including the GOP establishment.
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:41.902]  And I'm very suspect of Priebus still being within the White House.
[01:49:41.902 --> 01:49:44.563]  He's totally GOP establishment.
[01:49:44.563 --> 01:49:50.127]  And, you know, when it comes down to it, picking the ambassadors, now that we've got... Let's just say it.
[01:49:50.127 --> 01:49:54.869]  Priebus represents the GOP establishment that's bought and paid for by George Soros.
[01:49:54.869 --> 01:49:55.350]  It's a fact.
[01:49:56.030 --> 01:49:56.891]  It's a fact.
[01:49:56.891 --> 01:50:03.855]  I wrote in 2008, I did the first articles to show that John McCain had been financed by Soros.
[01:50:03.855 --> 01:50:06.257]  At least a dozen of them, including Ryan.
[01:50:06.257 --> 01:50:19.785]  And they don't want tax cuts because the truth is there's too many in the GOP establishment will become wealthy with the spending programs going right along with Obamacare, going right along with the Democrats.
[01:50:19.785 --> 01:50:23.348]  And the truth is that, you know, President Trump's got to realize
[01:50:24.028 --> 01:50:35.292]  The GOP establishment, including within the State Department, within many agencies, and within the White House itself, is not his friends, and given the chance, they will subvert his agenda.
[01:50:35.292 --> 01:50:40.914]  That's the whole... Well, I understand why he brought some of them in, because they know how to navigate the system and get people in place and hired.
[01:50:40.914 --> 01:50:41.354]  But now...
[01:50:42.901 --> 01:50:46.303]  I don't want to attack Spicer because I'm not sure about him, but previous I am.
[01:50:46.303 --> 01:51:00.572]  But you have all these front row people, and it's not that I even want to be in that front row, it's that why would you have all these known enemies that your president's calling fake there when you could have more reasonable newspapers or foreign press or a mix of it or even student journalists?
[01:51:01.536 --> 01:51:02.856]  Do something different.
[01:51:02.856 --> 01:51:14.580]  Kick out all these old, entrenched, corrupt dinosaurs, and then certainly they have to know Obama signed the bill to federalize communications and take over and start attacking the alt-right.
[01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:15.761]  I don't care if it was the alt-left.
[01:51:15.761 --> 01:51:20.502]  You can't shut down press in America or put the CIA over the Board of Governors or the FCC.
[01:51:20.502 --> 01:51:26.204]  I mean, this is nightmare stuff that is directed at Trump himself, saying, you know, kick Trump.
[01:51:26.204 --> 01:51:29.385]  The same group says kick Trump off Twitter because he's a hate monger.
[01:51:29.385 --> 01:51:30.786]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:51:31.584 --> 01:51:39.087]  Well, and it's also, you've got to understand, when Trump understands this, and I've known him for 40 years, he will make immediate changes.
[01:51:39.087 --> 01:51:42.068]  I mean, I've seen him, look at the campaign.
[01:51:42.068 --> 01:51:47.611]  When he needed to change campaign managers and bring in Manafort in order to manage delegates, he did so.
[01:51:48.171 --> 01:51:55.094]  When he needed a campaign manager that could really guide the campaign, Kellyanne Conway came on and did a brilliant job.
[01:51:55.094 --> 01:51:56.695]  These are Trump people.
[01:51:56.695 --> 01:52:01.897]  There are a lot of Trump people around willing to play a role in the administration and in the media.
[01:52:01.897 --> 01:52:10.942]  Now, Donald Trump realizes that the mainstream media is shutting out those of us who would help Trump when he realizes that the departments are still packed
[01:52:11.582 --> 01:52:14.884]  With John Kerry and Barack Obama supporters.
[01:52:14.884 --> 01:52:19.147]  There's going to be a massive firing out of the bureaucracy.
[01:52:19.147 --> 01:52:21.429]  And we need a bigger press room in the White House.
[01:52:21.429 --> 01:52:26.692]  We need more access for the internet, reporters and bloggers who truly support Donald Trump.
[01:52:26.692 --> 01:52:29.214]  Donald Trump wants to turn the press narrative around.
[01:52:29.214 --> 01:52:37.680]  He's going to get these mainstream... That's right, and that's all being blocked by Spicer, under orders of Priebus, and I know for a fact from multiple sources,
[01:52:38.803 --> 01:52:44.991]  Previs is going in with anybody Trump wanted and brought in that he's known and saying, the President's fired you.
[01:52:44.991 --> 01:52:46.894]  And the person's only here for the President.
[01:52:46.894 --> 01:52:50.218]  And then a day later, Spicer goes, let's be friends, let's be friends.
[01:52:50.218 --> 01:52:55.184]  Classic tactics that Rince Previs is engaged in.
[01:52:55.785 --> 01:52:56.846]  I mean, just look at the guy.
[01:52:56.846 --> 01:53:01.930]  He looks like a weasel out of central casting, but then look at his pedigree.
[01:53:01.930 --> 01:53:08.155]  He is the worst of the worst that tried to steal the nomination from Trump and said our votes didn't count as citizens.
[01:53:08.155 --> 01:53:10.037]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:53:10.037 --> 01:53:14.140]  So Trump is delivering on his promises so far, you know, day 18 or 19.
[01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:15.161]  I love him.
[01:53:15.161 --> 01:53:15.861]  It's amazing.
[01:53:15.861 --> 01:53:19.825]  The problem is you can see him being opposed in real time by his own people.
[01:53:20.578 --> 01:53:21.759]  Well Trump wants
[01:53:40.075 --> 01:53:43.316]  And then they leak, oh, the President admits he's wrong, he's not going to move fast.
[01:53:43.316 --> 01:53:45.417]  The next day he goes, I didn't say that, we're moving fast.
[01:53:45.417 --> 01:53:49.438]  They keep, again, just like Gingrich, saying, oh, the President told me it's all a lie.
[01:53:49.438 --> 01:53:50.558]  He's not going to drain the swamp.
[01:53:50.558 --> 01:53:53.459]  And the President said, you're a liar, go tell people that's a lie.
[01:53:53.459 --> 01:53:54.999]  He had to go say he was lying.
[01:53:54.999 --> 01:53:56.360]  They're really trying to undermine him.
[01:53:57.259 --> 01:53:57.659]  Exactly.
[01:53:57.659 --> 01:54:10.902]  If the President wants to, and he would want to change the narrative in this country, get rid of the mainstream media still sitting in the front row of the press office every time he comes in asking gotcha questions and determined to write negative stories.
[01:54:10.902 --> 01:54:14.263]  If you want to change the narrative in America, change the press room.
[01:54:14.263 --> 01:54:17.444]  A bigger press room, open to a more diverse press,
[01:54:18.104 --> 01:54:26.129]  And get this, David Brock and his other criminal leftists who want to destroy this country with censorship exposed along with Google and Facebook.
[01:54:26.129 --> 01:54:29.691]  Absolutely, and I want to add a couple points here and ringer some phone calls.
[01:54:29.691 --> 01:54:37.716]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you that Rens Prevost is on about half an inch thick ice and the sun just came out.
[01:54:38.550 --> 01:54:46.196]  So Rince Priebus can just enjoy himself all he wants and play his little sabotage games and sit there and kiss Trump's butt.
[01:54:46.196 --> 01:54:51.981]  Trump sees right through you just like he did whenever he met at the Trump Tower with Romney.
[01:54:51.981 --> 01:54:56.505]  And Romney is not a weasel compared to Priebus, I'll just say that, but it has its problems.
[01:54:56.505 --> 01:55:00.568]  And has tried to sell out to the GOP establishment, they betrayed him as well.
[01:55:00.568 --> 01:55:03.991]  But I mean, I told you weeks before, he's not going to be chosen
[01:55:05.131 --> 01:55:07.253]  For Secretary of State, and I told you that.
[01:55:07.253 --> 01:55:09.115]  And let me tell you, Trump knows what's going on.
[01:55:09.115 --> 01:55:13.019]  Now, I run a pretty good-sized company of 60-something people.
[01:55:13.019 --> 01:55:16.602]  I have issues sometimes with not knowing what folks are up to and finding out what's happening.
[01:55:16.602 --> 01:55:22.769]  So imagine President Trump with 4,000 people under him and all the subterfuge and everything else in his workload.
[01:55:22.769 --> 01:55:27.714]  I'm giving him an A+, because, I mean, he has done amazing things, but understand this.
[01:55:29.059 --> 01:55:36.662]  He needs us to be watchdogs, just as Stephen Bannon has come out and said, listen, keep us honest, watch what we're doing, because we can't watch every angle.
[01:55:36.662 --> 01:55:37.823]  This is crazy.
[01:55:37.823 --> 01:55:50.488]  Now, briefly, before I go to some phone calls with our guest here, I want people to know that my father is a recently retired dentist and oral surgeon and working with the biggest organic, fluoride-free toothpaste manufacturer in the United States.
[01:55:52.145 --> 01:56:01.881]  We created our private label, the proprietary, super blue non-fluoride toothpaste with iodine, nano-silver, peppermint, and tea tree oil, and it's concentrated.
[01:56:01.881 --> 01:56:02.922]  It's $9.95, it's a big tube.
[01:56:05.643 --> 01:56:10.225]  Your purchase supports the broadcast, and I mean, my dad wanted to put out Toothpaste years ago, and I'm like, people don't want that.
[01:56:10.225 --> 01:56:12.566]  People just buy the regular, you know, organic stuff.
[01:56:12.566 --> 01:56:13.687]  They don't need it to get it from us.
[01:56:13.687 --> 01:56:15.407]  But boy, he was right.
[01:56:15.407 --> 01:56:22.490]  This will now be the bestseller ever, replacing the Super Metal Vitality and replacing X2, because people love it.
[01:56:22.490 --> 01:56:32.035]  It's got a whole bunch of 4.8 star reviews on Power Reviews, Super Blue, available at InfoWarsTore.com, or call toll-free, 888.
[01:56:33.868 --> 01:56:34.569]  We're good to go.
[01:56:52.791 --> 01:56:53.091]  Hi Alex.
[01:56:53.091 --> 01:56:54.993]  Excited to speak to you for the first time.
[01:57:14.401 --> 01:57:16.942]  Um, I'm an avid listener of yours.
[01:57:16.942 --> 01:57:43.916]  Uh, I do a lot of research in every aspect, and I've realized that truly what you've said about, you know, the state of the country, you know, has actually become extremely, actually extremely in jeopardy for people like us who are truly fighting to be able to actually educate people on what's actually happening in the world because many people are just so brainwashed
[01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:50.285]  By the fact that they think what the mainstream media tells them is actually the truth.
[01:57:50.285 --> 01:57:51.846]  And it's not.
[01:57:51.846 --> 01:57:54.449]  In most aspects, it's nothing but lies.
[01:57:54.449 --> 01:57:56.610]  And that's become a huge problem.
[01:57:56.610 --> 01:58:00.434]  Because people actually believe this.
[01:58:00.434 --> 01:58:01.154]  Well, that's right.
[01:58:01.154 --> 01:58:02.675]  Some of us are awake and know what's going on.
[01:58:02.675 --> 01:58:03.896]  Not that we're perfect.
[01:58:03.896 --> 01:58:06.058]  Other people just believe whatever they're told.
[01:58:06.058 --> 01:58:08.861]  And believe that openly talking about killing Trump's a good thing.
[01:58:08.861 --> 01:58:10.962]  And mainstream media is promoting killing Trump.
[01:58:10.962 --> 01:58:12.584]  Where do you think this is all going, Dr. Corsi?
[01:58:13.675 --> 01:58:19.920]  Well, I think that basically the support in the country for Donald Trump has never been higher.
[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:23.562]  And I think the people are seeing that Donald Trump is doing a magnificent job.
[01:58:23.562 --> 01:58:28.106]  And Alex, I think he was on your show, I believe, three times in the campaign.
[01:58:28.106 --> 01:58:30.547]  He listens to you.
[01:58:30.547 --> 01:58:33.109]  We can see he's responded very quickly.
[01:58:34.350 --> 01:58:39.994]  Well, we'll stay right there.
[01:58:39.994 --> 01:58:40.314]  That's right.
[01:58:40.314 --> 01:58:45.338]  The people have to keep pressing, keep reaching out on Twitter to Trump, letting him know what's going on.
[01:58:45.338 --> 01:58:46.839]  He listens to you, folks.
[01:58:46.839 --> 01:58:48.900]  He listens to you.
[01:58:48.900 --> 01:58:49.421]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:50.845 --> 01:58:51.245]  We're right back.
[01:59:08.041 --> 01:59:14.503]  Now Father West has fallen under scrutiny from some of his colleagues who believe he is acting inappropriately and has gone too far.
[01:59:14.503 --> 01:59:16.324]  In 2004, a former St.
[01:59:16.324 --> 01:59:25.786]  Louis Archbishop, Cardinal Raymond Burke, took a hard political stance when he refused to allow the at-the-time Senator John Kerry to receive communion for his pro-choice views.
[01:59:25.786 --> 01:59:27.787]  Now, Burke is an avid Trump supporter,
[01:59:27.967 --> 01:59:29.827]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:04.943 --> 02:00:22.390]  Alright, coming up in the next segment I'm going to finish up with Mark, Star, Jake, Kevin and others.
[02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:24.010]  Of course he's leaving us here in about five minutes.
[02:00:24.010 --> 02:00:26.451]  Let's take a call from Todd here in a moment.
[02:00:26.451 --> 02:00:28.252]  Todd, you're on the air from Texas.
[02:00:28.252 --> 02:00:29.733]  Welcome.
[02:00:29.733 --> 02:00:31.634]  It's so awesome to talk to you, Alex.
[02:00:31.634 --> 02:00:32.174]  Good to talk to you.
[02:00:32.174 --> 02:00:32.394]  Go ahead.
[02:00:33.695 --> 02:00:36.112]  Alright, uh, you and Mr. Corsi both, uh...
[02:00:36.909 --> 02:00:44.175]  I'm kind of curious why Trump hasn't addressed Obama putting CIA over the Board of Governors in that last NDAA.
[02:00:44.175 --> 02:00:45.376]  Well, that's what we're hammering.
[02:00:45.376 --> 02:01:02.250]  I mean, Trump has a lot of big things like tax cuts and securing the border and battling the media and all the rest of it, but you would think this would all just get shut down, but that NDAA, that system to take over the media is still in place and Brock and Google and the Republicans are now still contending the agenda.
[02:01:02.250 --> 02:01:04.272]  That's exactly what we were just saying, Todd.
[02:01:06.118 --> 02:01:08.340]  Right, that's one of the reasons I wanted to bring it up to you.
[02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:18.346]  I know you're not per se in his ear, but you're in his ear, and like you said, we need to keep hammering it, because if it goes like it is, we're going to be extinct.
[02:01:18.346 --> 02:01:20.127]  Well, here's the deal, and I'll say this right now.
[02:01:20.127 --> 02:01:24.830]  There's a lot of stuff I want to get done around this office, and I have a great crew, but it's one thing to talk about.
[02:01:24.830 --> 02:01:31.534]  It's hard to get stuff done, and he's got to pick his battles, but he is going up against the media and discrediting it.
[02:01:31.534 --> 02:01:33.596]  He's a very sophisticated person, but I think the fact that
[02:01:34.793 --> 02:01:39.695]  The Republicans themselves are working with Brock and Google to undermine him.
[02:01:39.695 --> 02:01:41.035]  He's learning about that right now.
[02:01:41.035 --> 02:01:45.157]  I'm going to leave it there because I haven't talked to him in a while, like three weeks, but I can tell you this.
[02:01:45.157 --> 02:01:52.020]  Little birds have told me, not just Roger Stone, but little birds that Trump is now figuring it out.
[02:01:52.020 --> 02:01:56.662]  A lot of other things are going on and I don't want to give it away, but he's investigating right now.
[02:01:56.662 --> 02:01:57.102]  Dr. Corsi?
[02:01:58.653 --> 02:02:01.077]  I agree with you entirely.
[02:02:01.077 --> 02:02:05.122]  Trump is a brilliant manager and he will listen.
[02:02:05.122 --> 02:02:06.564]  He listens to you, Alex.
[02:02:06.564 --> 02:02:08.547]  He listens to the readers.
[02:02:08.547 --> 02:02:10.169]  He's very active on the internet.
[02:02:10.169 --> 02:02:12.753]  He spends his evenings listening.
[02:02:12.753 --> 02:02:14.655]  He's getting great appointments in place.
[02:02:15.656 --> 02:02:22.241]  I was very, very thrilled to see Senator Jeff Sessions confirmed this morning as Attorney General.
[02:02:22.241 --> 02:02:24.263]  That's a major, major step.
[02:02:24.263 --> 02:02:33.869]  But Trump has got to realize how much subversion from within, within the media, within the White House, this GOP Republican establishment cannot be trusted.
[02:02:33.869 --> 02:02:35.931]  They'll slow his agenda at every moment.
[02:02:35.931 --> 02:02:37.892]  I see this in D.C.
[02:02:37.892 --> 02:02:38.313]  I'm here.
[02:02:38.313 --> 02:02:39.073]  I've been all week.
[02:02:39.073 --> 02:02:39.413]  That's right.
[02:02:39.413 --> 02:02:41.435]  He can't bring them in and share power.
[02:02:41.435 --> 02:02:43.957]  They're going to be sabotaging him the entire time.
[02:02:44.653 --> 02:02:45.613]  That's right.
[02:02:45.613 --> 02:02:47.734]  And it's going to take Trump's awareness of it.
[02:02:47.734 --> 02:02:55.976]  Now once he fully catches on, I can assure you that Donald Trump will clean house and the same indications I think you're hearing, I'm hearing too.
[02:02:55.976 --> 02:02:57.737]  There will be changes coming.
[02:02:57.737 --> 02:02:58.957]  Talk about what you're hearing in D.C.
[02:02:58.957 --> 02:03:00.118]  I know you know all the heavy hitters.
[02:03:00.118 --> 02:03:00.618]  What's the word?
[02:03:01.226 --> 02:03:02.707]  Well, the word is just what you were saying.
[02:03:02.707 --> 02:03:08.852]  I mean, that, you know, that Priebus is actually trying to get rid of some of the Trump loyalists who have gone to Trump.
[02:03:08.852 --> 02:03:10.313]  And Trump said, what do you mean you're leaving?
[02:03:10.313 --> 02:03:10.934]  And what do you mean?
[02:03:10.934 --> 02:03:13.476]  I said, I want you to stay.
[02:03:13.476 --> 02:03:16.318]  And then they may point out that Priebus has been trying to get rid of them.
[02:03:16.318 --> 02:03:19.361]  And we can name some names, but I'd like to keep it confidential.
[02:03:19.361 --> 02:03:19.881]  Let's not do it.
[02:03:19.881 --> 02:03:20.702]  Yeah, let's not do it.
[02:03:20.942 --> 02:03:21.682]  By the way, I've been like...
[02:03:42.190 --> 02:03:48.772]  Six, eight, six, seven years ago, on the phone with you on Skype, during a break, you go, I gotta go, it's Donald Trump.
[02:03:48.772 --> 02:03:51.592]  And I've talked to folks, somebody's coming in your office, you can let them in, go ahead.
[02:03:51.592 --> 02:03:56.814]  I mean, the point is, is that, you know, Trump will get ahold of you soon, we'll figure all this stuff out.
[02:03:56.814 --> 02:03:58.114]  Have him come on in, it's no big deal.
[02:03:58.114 --> 02:03:59.995]  This is live Skype, people love it.
[02:03:59.995 --> 02:04:02.855]  But this is quite a time to be alive right now, Dr. Corsi.
[02:04:02.855 --> 02:04:04.956]  We've only got 60 seconds left, any other points?
[02:04:05.697 --> 02:04:14.928]  Well, I think my major point is that I'd love to tell listeners just continue to be on Twitter, continue to follow InfoWars.
[02:04:14.928 --> 02:04:16.470]  Your comments are listened to.
[02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:17.731]  Your articles are so key.
[02:04:17.731 --> 02:04:19.914]  Your articles are from deep sources.
[02:04:19.914 --> 02:04:22.317]  These are super important articles that Dr. Corsi's writing.
[02:04:23.624 --> 02:04:27.548]  And I'm going to have a whole series more next week on David Brock.
[02:04:27.548 --> 02:04:29.970]  David Brock is at the heart of fake news.
[02:04:29.970 --> 02:04:31.912]  He's the father of fake news.
[02:04:31.912 --> 02:04:33.674]  He's at the heart with Google.
[02:04:33.674 --> 02:04:35.135]  And Google's not to be trusted.
[02:04:35.135 --> 02:04:36.837]  Facebook's not to be trusted.
[02:04:36.837 --> 02:04:39.279]  They're both solidly anti-Trump.
[02:04:39.279 --> 02:04:43.403]  And we're going to expose this and continue exposing it until we can open up this press room.
[02:04:43.403 --> 02:04:45.866]  Alright, how do folks contact you if they want to give you news tips?
[02:04:45.866 --> 02:04:47.848]  We need to give you an InfoWars email soon.
[02:04:48.612 --> 02:04:51.534]  We have a priest in New Jersey who is starting to sound like one of us.
[02:04:51.534 --> 02:04:55.195]  Father Peter West, a Catholic priest in the Archdiocese of Newark, is an avid Trump supporter and not afraid to show it.
[02:04:55.195 --> 02:04:59.758]  This is a priest who posts on social media daily, taking on such topics as radical Islam, millennial safe spaces, and modern day liberals.
[02:05:18.027 --> 02:05:24.513]  Now Father West has fallen under scrutiny from some of his colleagues who believe he is acting inappropriately and has gone too far.
[02:05:24.513 --> 02:05:26.314]  In 2004, a former St.
[02:05:26.314 --> 02:05:35.782]  Louis Archbishop, Cardinal Raymond Burke, took a hard political stance when he refused to allow the at-the-time Senator John Kerry to receive communion for his pro-choice views.
[02:05:35.782 --> 02:05:37.784]  Now, Burke is an avid Trump supporter,
[02:05:37.964 --> 02:05:49.628]  Who has spoken out against radical Islam and was demoted in 2014 by Pope Francis from the head of the Vatican's highest court to a ceremonial position because of his public disagreements with Pope Francis.
[02:05:49.628 --> 02:05:56.991]  It's not surprising that Father West is gaining national attention and support because going against political correctness is growing in popularity.
[02:05:56.991 --> 02:06:00.392]  This is Owen Troyer for InfoWars.com, so not PC.

[02:06:03.734 --> 02:06:05.295]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[02:06:46.286 --> 02:06:49.449]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.

[02:06:58.277 --> 02:07:04.223]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[02:07:04.223 --> 02:07:05.364]  They lost.
[02:07:05.364 --> 02:07:05.764]  We won.
[02:07:05.764 --> 02:07:09.027]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[02:07:09.027 --> 02:07:12.030]  RevelationTheMovie.info.
[02:07:12.030 --> 02:07:15.974]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[02:07:16.718 --> 02:07:22.524]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[02:07:22.524 --> 02:07:28.690]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[02:07:28.690 --> 02:07:34.095]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[02:07:34.095 --> 02:07:37.439]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[02:07:37.699 --> 02:07:38.880]  We're the solution!
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:39.860]  Americans!
[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:41.401]  Ain't nothin' more to it than that!
[02:07:41.401 --> 02:07:46.764]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[02:07:46.764 --> 02:07:48.445]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[02:07:48.445 --> 02:07:50.346]  DVDs now available.
[02:07:50.346 --> 02:07:53.788]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[02:07:53.788 --> 02:07:55.989]  Americans need to see this film.
[02:08:11.317 --> 02:08:13.458]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:13.458 --> 02:08:20.603]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:08:20.603 --> 02:08:23.885]  There's an article up on Infowars.com that everybody should go see.
[02:08:23.885 --> 02:08:24.705]  Shock photo!
[02:08:24.705 --> 02:08:27.827]  Human breast milk destroys deadly bacteria.
[02:08:27.827 --> 02:08:32.730]  Whoever knew it was an incredible disinfectant and antibacterial?
[02:08:32.730 --> 02:08:35.972]  But it's a conspiracy theory that babies have ever even needed it.
[02:08:37.659 --> 02:08:51.106]  That's an example of why in the industrialized society, they said, we need women in factories, not breastfeeding their babies, and then the brains are smaller, the public is stupid, and it gives rise to the zombie population.
[02:08:51.106 --> 02:08:56.409]  You can go see in a Petri dish what breast milk does to bacteria versus other substances.
[02:08:56.409 --> 02:08:58.790]  It annihilates it.
[02:08:58.790 --> 02:09:05.013]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, it's a conspiracy theory that women ever breastfed their children.
[02:09:05.013 --> 02:09:05.914]  That's where we're going.
[02:09:07.168 --> 02:09:14.216]  I even saw the cover of a parent magazine about, are we doing too many cesareans?
[02:09:14.216 --> 02:09:15.398]  Oh no.
[02:09:15.398 --> 02:09:20.684]  Again, it's all about taking control of the entire human environment.
[02:09:20.684 --> 02:09:23.207]  I want to go to your phone calls, but I also want to hit a few clips before we do that.
[02:09:24.517 --> 02:09:28.559]  So we have Bill Kristol, I played earlier, saying white working class should be replaced by immigrants.
[02:09:28.559 --> 02:09:36.683]  We have Sally Brown famously saying that she'll, running for the DNC inside the party, that she will suppress white people even though she's white.
[02:09:36.683 --> 02:09:41.805]  It'll be her job to make sure they don't get privileged and that the people of color get privileged.
[02:09:41.805 --> 02:09:45.487]  This is just role reversals of racism.
[02:09:45.487 --> 02:09:53.611]  There's a bigger report then that ties into all of this by John Bowne and then Dear White People, a new Netflix show that's kind of like the MTV shows.
[02:09:54.804 --> 02:09:57.025]  That, you know, teaches you how it's bad that you're white.
[02:09:57.025 --> 02:09:59.086]  I mean, this is the craziest thing.
[02:09:59.086 --> 02:10:09.471]  I'm sorry 7% of the world doesn't have a lot of pigment in their skin and lived up in the frozen north and so had to develop some science and technology.
[02:10:09.471 --> 02:10:21.017]  And maybe you can argue science and technology has been bad, but it's like this arrogance and this hatred of white people that the corporations are selling.
[02:10:21.017 --> 02:10:22.298]  This isn't coming from
[02:10:23.953 --> 02:10:25.775]  Quote, minorities.
[02:10:25.775 --> 02:10:38.390]  And then it just re-invokes like 1940s or 30s supposed racism that even went on, that only went on sporadically, and re-invokes it and shows black people breaking things and throwing things down and revolting against the enemy.
[02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:40.252]  I mean, this is so scientific!
[02:10:43.356 --> 02:10:49.499]  And it's disgusting, and people are tired of it, and it's meant to make white people racist.
[02:10:49.499 --> 02:10:50.759]  Let's give you the big news flash.
[02:10:50.759 --> 02:10:54.001]  It's not just meant to make black people and Hispanics anti-white.
[02:10:54.001 --> 02:11:00.144]  It's meant to make whites be racist as well, and the whole balkanization plan works just perfectly.
[02:11:02.605 --> 02:11:08.112]  Continuing, Amazon's new robot-run supermarket will phase out human employees.
[02:11:08.112 --> 02:11:08.773]  But you know what?
[02:11:08.773 --> 02:11:10.855]  So what about a world being built that's anti-human?
[02:11:10.855 --> 02:11:14.720]  Let's all just fight with each other over what color we are.
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:16.342]  No scientific basis for airport
[02:11:17.324 --> 02:11:25.333]  Behavior screening, TSA internal file show, it's just made up and I'm not bashing the TSA themselves, but they've got an unconstitutional job.
[02:11:25.333 --> 02:11:31.620]  You're supposed to control the external borders and vet people and then leave people alone inside the country.
[02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:33.061]  Besides, who does all the terror attacks?
[02:11:33.061 --> 02:11:34.042]  Muslims!
[02:11:34.042 --> 02:11:38.207]  You're not supposed to say that, see, because your reality is politically incorrect.
[02:11:40.387 --> 02:11:43.990]  Meanwhile, the military is training for martial law here in the United States.
[02:11:43.990 --> 02:11:48.614]  Microaggression and safe space have now been added to the Merriam-Webster dictionary.
[02:11:48.614 --> 02:11:49.695]  How about adult?
[02:11:49.695 --> 02:11:51.096]  Or how about brainwashed?
[02:11:51.096 --> 02:11:52.758]  Or how about crippled public?
[02:11:52.758 --> 02:11:54.699]  How about public put under mind control?
[02:11:54.699 --> 02:11:58.523]  And coming up in the next hour, the number one mind control program at U.S.
[02:11:58.523 --> 02:11:59.363]  colleges.
[02:11:59.363 --> 02:12:01.605]  The unspoken secret in plain sight.
[02:12:01.605 --> 02:12:05.389]  If you're a college student or have children at college, read this.
[02:12:05.389 --> 02:12:06.469]  Powerful report.
[02:12:07.190 --> 02:12:09.131]  By John Rapoport on InfoWars.com.
[02:12:09.131 --> 02:12:12.734]  In fact, will you guys retweet that for me at Real Alex Jones?
[02:12:12.734 --> 02:12:15.996]  Just say, the secret of modern education.
[02:12:15.996 --> 02:12:19.599]  The secret concerning modern education they don't want you to know.
[02:12:19.599 --> 02:12:20.680]  That should be the real headline.
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:25.063]  It is powerful, powerful information.
[02:12:25.063 --> 02:12:31.007]  But speaking of clips, let's go ahead and go to this next little clip here.
[02:12:31.007 --> 02:12:33.649]  We've got Coretta Scott King.
[02:12:33.649 --> 02:12:35.931]  Thanks Jeff Sessions for Rosa Parks Library.
[02:12:37.049 --> 02:12:40.090]  Don't think you're going to hear about this in the news.
[02:12:56.300 --> 02:12:57.941]  I've known Jeff Sessions for 20 years.
[02:12:57.941 --> 02:12:58.681]  He's a good and decent man.
[02:12:58.681 --> 02:13:00.961]  He believes in law and order for all the people.
[02:13:00.961 --> 02:13:01.902]  All the people in Alabama,
[02:13:23.610 --> 02:13:32.772]  Because of his colleagues and all that surrounded him, the things that he's done for the law enforcement community and the citizens of Alabama, it's great.
[02:13:32.772 --> 02:13:40.593]  It's without any questions as to whether or not he will be fit to serve this country as the United States Attorney General.
[02:13:40.593 --> 02:13:48.034]  Now, I did not learn these things from a political press conference or any website where I read about him.
[02:13:48.034 --> 02:13:50.835]  I know Jeff Sessions as the man, the man that I know.
[02:13:51.531 --> 02:14:00.861]  It's a decent and honest and respectful man that will put all of his life into public service.
[02:14:00.861 --> 02:14:07.969]  When we talk about this criminal justice system, we enforce the laws.
[02:14:07.969 --> 02:14:11.032]  And we do it because we have a love for the laws.
[02:14:11.032 --> 02:14:12.394]  Jeff Sessions loved
[02:14:13.303 --> 02:14:16.464]  The people that do the enforcement side of it, he respects.
[02:14:16.464 --> 02:14:27.886]  The citizen deserves a good and honest person that's going to give all he has to make sure that everyone is treated equally and fairly under the law.
[02:14:27.886 --> 02:14:34.027]  But his decency as a man and his honesty as a man speak for itself.
[02:14:34.027 --> 02:14:42.089]  He's the type of individual that I support for the United States Attorney General's Office because of my reputation and his history with me as a person.
[02:14:43.067 --> 02:14:47.828]  And the things that I've seen over the years in Jeff Sessions, it's hard being a public servant.
[02:14:47.828 --> 02:14:51.309]  I was in law and been in law enforcement for 40 years.
[02:14:51.309 --> 02:14:53.470]  It's a tough job.
[02:14:53.470 --> 02:14:55.210]  We don't violate the laws.
[02:14:55.210 --> 02:15:00.852]  We don't get out there and do things that would cause ourselves to be brought into the system.
[02:15:00.852 --> 02:15:03.733]  And I'm not saying everybody is the same.
[02:15:03.733 --> 02:15:03.893]  But
[02:15:04.708 --> 02:15:19.356]  I believe that he'll take hold of the justice system, justice department, and he'll be fair, he'll be honest, and he'll do the same thing for every person with honesty and respect for all of us.
[02:15:19.356 --> 02:15:22.137]  And by the way, I'm teleprompter free, so I make mistakes sometimes.
[02:15:22.137 --> 02:15:23.278]  I can't keep track of all this.
[02:15:23.278 --> 02:15:27.620]  I know that Martin Luther King's daughter has come out in support of Trump.
[02:15:27.620 --> 02:15:28.761]  I know his niece has.
[02:15:28.761 --> 02:15:31.462]  I've had both of them on over the years.
[02:15:31.462 --> 02:15:32.443]  And that's his widow.
[02:15:33.325 --> 02:15:35.526]  In fact, after I said it, I said, that's not right.
[02:15:35.526 --> 02:15:35.906]  Who is that?
[02:15:35.906 --> 02:15:37.366]  They go, yeah, that's his wife.
[02:15:37.366 --> 02:15:38.647]  Widow.
[02:15:38.647 --> 02:15:49.171]  So, Martin Luther King's widow has come out in support of Sessions and they're calling a KKK member and all this other made-up crap because they know him in Alabama.
[02:15:49.171 --> 02:15:50.131]  They know it's not true.
[02:15:50.131 --> 02:15:51.972]  So here's Coretta Scott King.
[02:15:51.972 --> 02:15:53.472]  Thanks Jeff Sessions.
[02:15:53.472 --> 02:15:57.594]  For Rosa Parks Library, here it is.
[02:15:57.594 --> 02:16:00.635]  To President Martindale, to
[02:16:05.433 --> 02:16:18.019]  Senator Sessions, Mayor Bright, Troy State Chancellor Jack Hawkins Jr., Dr. Dorothy Height, Ms.
[02:16:18.019 --> 02:16:31.785]  Johnny Carr, Juanita Abernathy, Mamie Till, Mobley, to all of the distinguished program participants and guests in this audience today.
[02:16:33.510 --> 02:16:44.213]  It's a great honor and privilege for me to join you in celebrating the grand opening of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum.
[02:16:44.213 --> 02:16:53.255]  History teaches us that all great freedom movements began with an inspiring act of courage.
[02:16:53.255 --> 02:16:59.697]  And in this regard, the American Civil Rights Movement provides a supreme example.
[02:16:59.697 --> 02:17:02.538]  The library and museum we dedicate today
[02:17:03.783 --> 02:17:15.889]  Is a living testament to the courage, commitment, and character of the great woman whose act of courage sparked our freedom struggle.
[02:17:15.889 --> 02:17:20.472]  The woman we call Mrs. Rosa Louise Parks.
[02:17:20.472 --> 02:17:21.312]  Alright, incredible.
[02:17:21.312 --> 02:17:23.914]  Scott King, the late widow of Martin Luther King, died in 2006.
[02:17:23.914 --> 02:17:28.136]  So there she is on the grave thanking Jeff Sessions.
[02:17:31.732 --> 02:17:45.335]  We're going to go to break and come back with the phone calls from Jake, first in Washington, and then Star, and then Mark, and then Kevin, and Evan, and then we have a guest joining us from Europe, an investigative journalist, into why do the Muslims rape women so much?
[02:17:45.335 --> 02:17:57.877]  I mean, one guy just reportedly sexually attacked 18 women on a train for two hours as the men cuckolded, you know, let the government, you know, defend, laid there and took it.
[02:17:59.591 --> 02:18:03.194]  Just crazy to see people just roll over to tyranny.
[02:18:03.194 --> 02:18:08.219]  Before I go any further, we have undoubtedly the very best toothpaste in the world.
[02:18:08.219 --> 02:18:14.705]  No one's thought to put colloidal silver and iodine in it along with the peppermint oil and tea tree oil and other things.
[02:18:14.705 --> 02:18:19.930]  This is the national best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste, private label by us, but at the major factory.
[02:18:21.314 --> 02:18:23.235]  Having these ingredients added.
[02:18:23.235 --> 02:18:25.055]  It took my dad over a year to get this done.
[02:18:25.055 --> 02:18:26.416]  This is the second batch.
[02:18:26.416 --> 02:18:27.216]  People really love it.
[02:18:27.216 --> 02:18:34.299]  We have bubblegum flavor coming soon that doesn't have the peppermint and the tea tree oil in it because that's a little strong for kids sometimes.
[02:18:34.299 --> 02:18:36.820]  But this is really a great adult toothpaste.
[02:18:36.820 --> 02:18:41.521]  And your purchase of it, it's $9.95, funds our operation and what we do here.
[02:18:41.521 --> 02:18:43.042]  Super Blue, non-fluoride.
[02:18:45.267 --> 02:18:46.967]  With iodine and nano silver.
[02:18:46.967 --> 02:18:49.328]  Infowarsstore.com.

[02:19:19.558 --> 02:19:27.261]  They advertise it as an air purification on the go, but I mean, sure it purifies the air, but what it is, is a negative ion generator.
[02:19:27.261 --> 02:19:30.202]  That's a lot better than just the regular units that are out there.
[02:19:30.202 --> 02:19:31.743]  The science has gotten a lot clearer.
[02:19:33.984 --> 02:19:37.206]  Some of the ozone generators will clear a room out, but it's also probably not good for you in high levels.

[02:24:20.908 --> 02:24:39.222]  So there's a system called Code Next that the UN basically developed and wrote that Austin's adopting where they take full control of all your existing neighborhoods and put you under neighborhood association zoning with local block captains that control you, inspect your house, tell you how you can repaint what you can do.
[02:24:39.222 --> 02:24:41.224]  It's designed to end single-family dwellings.
[02:24:41.224 --> 02:24:42.285]  It's hellish.
[02:24:42.285 --> 02:24:50.010]  So I saw an article on Affordable Austin that broke down, it was like a Stephen King nightmare novel, and so I gave it a bunch of attention.
[02:24:51.081 --> 02:24:52.762]  And I said, this is accurate.
[02:24:52.762 --> 02:24:54.444]  And I said, this is a worldwide plan.
[02:24:54.444 --> 02:24:56.746]  Austin is a test city.
[02:24:56.746 --> 02:24:58.447]  This person knew this three years ago.
[02:24:58.447 --> 02:25:08.135]  And there's an article up on Facebook with a video that Rob Dood did of Code Next that is, again, on Facebook right now.
[02:25:09.229 --> 02:25:17.075]  So I tell the person, hey, we'd like to have you on as a guest, and they say, well, I don't really agree with your subject matter, but maybe.
[02:25:17.075 --> 02:25:19.096]  Let me explain something.
[02:25:19.096 --> 02:25:26.241]  I'm not saying that to you at your Affordable Austin website because I need you on the show.
[02:25:26.241 --> 02:25:28.203]  I've got too much news to cover.
[02:25:28.203 --> 02:25:32.806]  I'm saying it because leftists will never talk to anybody.
[02:25:32.806 --> 02:25:35.088]  You agree this is a big screw job.
[02:25:35.088 --> 02:25:37.710]  I'm trying to help you recruit a bunch of Austinites to beat it.
[02:25:38.834 --> 02:25:43.175]  The test city of the raping you write about.
[02:25:43.175 --> 02:25:47.256]  And then you don't want to come on because you don't agree with the show.
[02:25:47.256 --> 02:25:50.516]  That'd be like saying you wouldn't go on Fox News if you disagree with them.
[02:25:50.516 --> 02:25:51.877]  It's called publicity.
[02:25:51.877 --> 02:25:53.577]  It's called talking to each other.
[02:25:53.577 --> 02:25:57.318]  But it's especially the left.
[02:25:57.318 --> 02:26:02.819]  They will not talk to anybody they don't agree with, even though you do agree with us.
[02:26:02.819 --> 02:26:03.759]  It's just crazy.
[02:26:05.441 --> 02:26:09.283]  It's absolutely, totally insane.
[02:26:09.283 --> 02:26:17.429]  They're telling people at yoga studios all over Austin, this has been on the news after we talked about it last year, don't ever wear Indian style jewelry or dress.
[02:26:17.429 --> 02:26:18.709]  It's cultural appropriation.
[02:26:18.709 --> 02:26:20.030]  It upsets Indians.
[02:26:20.030 --> 02:26:21.031]  No Indians are even upset.
[02:26:21.031 --> 02:26:21.892]  It doesn't matter.
[02:26:21.892 --> 02:26:22.452]  It's a free country.
[02:26:22.452 --> 02:26:27.975]  It's like somebody saying somebody in India can't wear blue jeans because it's what cowboys developed, you know, in the West.
[02:26:27.975 --> 02:26:28.696]  It's crazy.
[02:26:33.092 --> 02:26:36.915]  Or like a Hawaiian, you know, fishhook necklace from Maui around my neck.
[02:26:36.915 --> 02:26:38.296]  I shouldn't wear it because I'm not Hawaiian.
[02:26:38.296 --> 02:26:42.359]  It's cult-level racism garbage.
[02:26:42.359 --> 02:26:43.980]  And it goes further with tribalism.
[02:26:45.572 --> 02:26:48.613]  Where, hey, here we are, one of the biggest shows in the world.
[02:26:48.613 --> 02:26:49.553]  We're showing your article.
[02:26:49.553 --> 02:26:50.753]  This person really gets it.
[02:26:50.753 --> 02:26:57.095]  Hey, why don't you come on and talk about your experience with this whole global corporate zoning tyranny that ends private property rights.
[02:26:57.095 --> 02:26:58.315]  Oh, I better not.
[02:26:58.315 --> 02:27:01.356]  See, because you're afraid what might happen to you.
[02:27:01.356 --> 02:27:03.396]  You might get criticized.
[02:27:03.396 --> 02:27:06.357]  You want to be criticized by the establishment.
[02:27:06.357 --> 02:27:08.857]  You want to stand up for what you believe in.
[02:27:08.857 --> 02:27:11.358]  It's like a nation of jellyfish.
[02:27:13.393 --> 02:27:15.194]  What will a nation of sheep be ruled by?
[02:27:15.194 --> 02:27:16.814]  Wolves.
[02:27:16.814 --> 02:27:18.335]  Wolfs.
[02:27:18.335 --> 02:27:19.716]  Woof, woof.
[02:27:19.716 --> 02:27:21.396]  Very frustrating.
[02:27:21.396 --> 02:27:27.659]  And you just run into it, and it's just the tibidness, the testosterone level's almost gone, the sperm count's almost gone.
[02:27:27.659 --> 02:27:29.679]  We're dead already.
[02:27:29.679 --> 02:27:33.941]  And those of us that still exhibit any male traits really are.
[02:27:33.941 --> 02:27:36.662]  We're the bad ones.
[02:27:36.662 --> 02:27:40.584]  Men and women got the species here, but it's just for them, it's all over.
[02:27:40.584 --> 02:27:40.924]  I get it.
[02:27:43.186 --> 02:27:50.931]  But you know something's a zoning scam by the big rent seekers to screw you over and put you in a cult, but you won't fight it.
[02:27:50.931 --> 02:27:54.693]  And you won't fight with other people that understand it.
[02:27:54.693 --> 02:27:55.373]  Doesn't matter though.
[02:27:55.373 --> 02:27:57.514]  I will educate people by your ignorance, see?
[02:27:57.514 --> 02:27:58.755]  You will not stop me.
[02:27:58.755 --> 02:28:02.677]  And there are people that want the truth.
[02:28:02.677 --> 02:28:04.278]  Unbelievable.
[02:28:04.278 --> 02:28:06.439]  Jake in Washington, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:28:06.439 --> 02:28:08.781]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:28:09.468 --> 02:28:10.769]  You know, a lot of good stuff's happening.
[02:28:10.769 --> 02:28:14.111]  Trump is over-delivering, but he's just surrounded by traitors.
[02:28:14.111 --> 02:28:15.912]  It's really sad.
[02:28:15.912 --> 02:28:16.833]  Yeah, it is.
[02:28:16.833 --> 02:28:18.474]  First off, I want to thank you.
[02:28:18.474 --> 02:28:25.499]  I've been listening for the last two years, and you've given me a lot of education that the schools obviously aren't going to give us.
[02:28:25.499 --> 02:28:30.763]  You know, I'm a young patriot out here, you know, in Washington State, and that's hard, you know.
[02:28:30.763 --> 02:28:33.104]  And, you know, I actually just turned 21 today.
[02:28:34.441 --> 02:28:40.045]  And I was trying to think what I could do to try to, you know, express my views on how I feel.
[02:28:40.045 --> 02:28:42.206]  So, you know, I started a little YouTube channel.
[02:28:42.206 --> 02:28:44.608]  I got a little Twitter account.
[02:28:44.608 --> 02:28:49.671]  And, you know, basically the thing I'm calling in about is I don't understand how this so-called judge
[02:28:56.637 --> 02:29:00.861]  Because there's judiciary as well as bureaucratic open sedition and rebellion.
[02:29:00.861 --> 02:29:02.242]  The law is crystal clear.
[02:29:02.242 --> 02:29:05.305]  A lobotomized moron could understand it, literally.
[02:29:05.305 --> 02:29:08.908]  And they're just acting like the president just did something bad.
[02:29:08.908 --> 02:29:10.370]  Oh look he was breathing!
[02:29:10.370 --> 02:29:13.413]  Oh at 2am he was seen in a bathrobe outside his bedroom.
[02:29:14.193 --> 02:29:15.714]  That's why he doesn't want to stay at the White House.
[02:29:15.714 --> 02:29:18.236]  He's surrounded by a bunch of spies.
[02:29:18.236 --> 02:29:20.577]  Trump has to sleep in a big spy base.
[02:29:20.577 --> 02:29:22.699]  A big globalist command base.
[02:29:22.699 --> 02:29:24.520]  The guy's a saint.
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:26.542]  He's so manly, it's insane.
[02:29:26.542 --> 02:29:28.843]  His energy's like ten bulls.
[02:29:28.843 --> 02:29:33.586]  I'm telling you folks, I'm 43, and I am just so sick of all this.
[02:29:33.586 --> 02:29:38.890]  It's not that I can't beat them, it's that the globalists are such scum, to study them and to look at them.
[02:29:39.810 --> 02:29:42.012]  It's just, I can't stand it.
[02:29:42.012 --> 02:29:43.493]  God bless you, Jake.
[02:29:43.493 --> 02:29:44.254]  Alright, I'm out of time.
[02:29:44.254 --> 02:29:46.616]  We've got another special guest coming up in more of your calls straight ahead.
[02:29:46.616 --> 02:29:49.438]  You want to hear about all the Muslim rake games?
[02:29:49.438 --> 02:29:51.080]  They all love it.
[02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:54.623]  They love it, the feminists.
[02:29:54.623 --> 02:29:57.285]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.297 --> 02:30:07.842]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:30:07.842 --> 02:30:11.064]  Dr. Group, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:30:11.064 --> 02:30:16.649]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:30:16.649 --> 02:30:22.773]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:30:22.773 --> 02:30:26.056]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:30:26.056 --> 02:30:27.497]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:30:27.697 --> 02:30:32.019]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:30:32.019 --> 02:30:34.960]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:30:34.960 --> 02:30:36.621]  It works like an antioxidant.

[02:33:18.548 --> 02:33:23.490]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[02:33:23.490 --> 02:33:29.412]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.412 --> 02:33:33.653]  Celia Farber is a journalist joining us from Sweden.
[02:33:33.653 --> 02:33:38.955]  I mean, no kidding, I probably without looking see 15 articles a day or more of women being raped all over Europe.
[02:33:40.347 --> 02:33:47.409]  The police coming out almost every day saying they've been ordered in Germany, Sweden, France, the Netherlands to cover up the rapes.
[02:33:47.409 --> 02:33:55.410]  There was a new one out where an asylum seeker arrested after abusing 18 women during a two-hour train journey.
[02:33:55.410 --> 02:34:03.932]  Because in these radical Islamic Orthodox cultures, if a woman is out and she's not wearing a hood over her head, you get to rape her.
[02:34:03.932 --> 02:34:06.013]  Or if she's even unattended by a man, you get to rape her.
[02:34:06.013 --> 02:34:07.273]  And then she gets charged with rape.
[02:34:08.223 --> 02:34:14.787]  Now, the craziest thing is seeing women in Germany chanting Allah Akbar and handing out hajibs.
[02:34:14.787 --> 02:34:16.568]  Same thing in New York.
[02:34:16.568 --> 02:34:18.409]  This is Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:34:18.409 --> 02:34:21.871]  And I guess our guest is in Sweden, so she can explain that to us.
[02:34:21.871 --> 02:34:24.152]  But obviously, Stockholm Syndrome didn't come from Sweden.
[02:34:24.152 --> 02:34:26.013]  It was first identified in Sweden.
[02:34:26.013 --> 02:34:34.918]  But let's say a thousand years ago, Vikings pulled up at your little Anglo-Saxon village and grabbed you and hauled you off.
[02:34:34.918 --> 02:34:36.419]  And you were, say, a 15-year-old girl.
[02:34:37.267 --> 02:34:38.988]  And they start raping you and stuff.
[02:34:38.988 --> 02:34:48.575]  You're gonna try to go ahead and conform and cook them food and be nice to them and hope when they're done with you they just throw you off on the side of the shore somewhere else and don't throw you over the side of the boat.
[02:34:48.575 --> 02:34:49.696]  So it's the same deal.
[02:34:49.696 --> 02:34:51.558]  And so it's Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:34:51.558 --> 02:34:56.521]  And liberalism, modern liberalism is a mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:34:56.521 --> 02:35:01.465]  Western men have conformed really trying to empower women so we've become cuckold.
[02:35:01.465 --> 02:35:02.646]  Now that's my view on it but
[02:35:04.169 --> 02:35:04.370]  Ms.
[02:35:04.370 --> 02:35:10.775]  Farber is an American print journalist and author and investigative reporter based in New York City and Sweden.
[02:35:10.775 --> 02:35:23.906]  And she was an early critic of the political correctness in all forms and has covered a range of topics from magazines including Spin, Rolling Stone, Esquire, Harper's, Interview, Salon, Gear, New York Press, Media Post, The New York Post, and Sunday Herald.
[02:35:23.906 --> 02:35:25.827]  And a 1998 report on the O.J.
[02:35:25.827 --> 02:35:27.509]  Simpson post-trial life in Esquire.
[02:35:28.489 --> 02:35:34.974]  She is a daughter of radio talk show host Barry Farber, a graduate of New York University, truthbarrier.com.
[02:35:34.974 --> 02:35:37.755]  Follow her on Twitter, you can go there and find that as well.
[02:35:37.755 --> 02:35:39.196]  She's also on Facebook.
[02:35:39.196 --> 02:35:45.801]  But what I find interesting is, I remember in the last 20 years there were lots of people, I wouldn't call right-wing or left-wing, that spoke out against political correctness.
[02:35:45.801 --> 02:35:47.502]  I mean, Seinfeld has.
[02:35:47.502 --> 02:35:50.584]  But it just seems like it doesn't care, like a cult, it just gets...
[02:35:51.519 --> 02:35:53.200]  Worse and worse and more and more crazy.
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:55.901]  There are people calling Joe Rogan racist for having me on.
[02:35:55.901 --> 02:35:56.682]  I'm not racist.
[02:35:56.682 --> 02:36:00.684]  Everybody knows he's liberal on a lot of issues, but he now becomes racist.
[02:36:00.684 --> 02:36:02.625]  It just doesn't work anymore.
[02:36:02.625 --> 02:36:02.905]  So Ms.
[02:36:02.905 --> 02:36:14.872]  Farber, explain to me your overview of what's happening currently and then the reports you wanted to break down about all these gang rapes and people videotaping it and just the type of bizarre
[02:36:16.288 --> 02:36:17.568]  Well, great to be with you.
[02:36:17.568 --> 02:36:18.889]  I listen to your show every day.
[02:36:18.889 --> 02:36:19.969]  Well, thank you for joining us.
[02:36:19.969 --> 02:36:20.149]  Thank you.
[02:36:34.375 --> 02:36:47.103]  I actually, it's a very strange silence bubble here in Sweden, because I'll see, the stories that are happening in Sweden, very often I find out about them, first of all, on InfoWars.
[02:36:47.103 --> 02:36:51.266]  I go to the grocery store, I see the newspaper, that one right here, right?
[02:36:51.266 --> 02:36:53.908]  And you'll say, oh, I've shopped Sweden, right?
[02:36:53.908 --> 02:36:56.850]  And I don't see a word about it in the Swedish press.
[02:36:56.850 --> 02:36:59.431]  So the first thing is that we're in a, like,
[02:37:00.572 --> 02:37:07.015]  Probably the most extremist outpost of political correctness on the planet right here.
[02:37:07.015 --> 02:37:14.980]  But also there's a cultural tradition of silence and cloaking, which is why I want to tell you about the
[02:37:15.740 --> 02:37:30.770]  There's a freedom movement that is just days old that has been bursting forth from a couple of brave characters who, again, I learned about them first on InfoWars.
[02:37:30.770 --> 02:37:37.154]  Well, let's talk about it, because it seems the harder you hold on a beach ball underwater, the stronger it ends up coming up out of the water.
[02:37:37.154 --> 02:37:43.899]  So let's talk about the type of mind control, because it's admitted, that's where Stockholm Syndrome, I guess, was first identified.
[02:37:43.899 --> 02:37:45.080]  Why are the Swedes so
[02:37:49.602 --> 02:37:53.345]  Oh boy, that's a great question.
[02:37:53.345 --> 02:37:55.406]  It's a big question.
[02:37:55.406 --> 02:38:06.253]  As a Swedish-American, I moved here when I was 11 years old and then moved back to the States, and I've spent most of my life in the States, but I've been looking at Sweden, trying to figure them out for a very long time, and that's a great question.
[02:38:07.193 --> 02:38:17.027]  It's a rare extreme society where they started the social engineering that you depict so brilliantly on your show.
[02:38:17.027 --> 02:38:18.248]  They mastered it here.
[02:38:18.248 --> 02:38:19.430]  They started it here.
[02:38:19.430 --> 02:38:21.032]  It started here in the 1950s.
[02:38:22.734 --> 02:38:26.036]  So, I hope we can maybe return to this in future conversations.
[02:38:26.036 --> 02:38:27.577]  Sure, let's do an hour in the future.
[02:38:27.577 --> 02:38:30.359]  This sounds really important and I'm aware of it, but you live it.
[02:38:30.359 --> 02:38:31.579]  You've been there, you report on it.
[02:38:31.579 --> 02:38:36.382]  I mean, it seems like it's a self-hate or a giving over of the will.
[02:38:36.382 --> 02:38:38.764]  I mean, really low crime, really nice people.
[02:38:38.764 --> 02:38:42.226]  Historically, I mean, it's a cliche, but it's true.
[02:38:42.226 --> 02:38:46.888]  You know, Canadians, Swedes, folks like that are known for being really nice.
[02:38:46.888 --> 02:38:49.250]  They're very, I want to say, they're very...
[02:38:50.362 --> 02:38:56.325]  Decent, good, law-abiding, cautious, decent, really decent people.
[02:38:56.325 --> 02:39:00.187]  But they're terrified of their shadow.
[02:39:00.187 --> 02:39:04.810]  They're terrified of being something.
[02:39:04.810 --> 02:39:09.012]  Political correctness is like the perfect catastrophe here because of
[02:39:10.393 --> 02:39:18.155]  Atheism, and Lutheranism, and political correctness, and socialism, and social democracy, all these, it's like the perfect storm.
[02:39:18.155 --> 02:39:22.696]  And then you have the, I should say first of all, there's many different stories.
[02:39:22.696 --> 02:39:27.837]  There's a lot that I've found out just in the last 48 hours that I, this isn't exactly my beat.
[02:39:27.837 --> 02:39:32.698]  I'm in Sweden now, I've been here for several months, living here temporarily.
[02:39:32.698 --> 02:39:34.879]  So it's, I'm not the, like the world expert.
[02:39:34.879 --> 02:39:37.400]  No, no, just report on what you're witnessing there.
[02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:38.360]  Right, what I'm witnessing is,
[02:39:39.637 --> 02:39:43.407]  Um, as you said, the beach ball effect, there's a.
[02:39:45.885 --> 02:39:53.972]  There's a freshly minted folk hero, and I'm going to go ahead and call him a folk hero, even though he's also an anti-hero.
[02:39:53.972 --> 02:39:55.853]  He's also under attack.
[02:39:55.853 --> 02:39:57.194]  And you've reported on him.
[02:39:57.194 --> 02:40:00.157]  His name is Peter Springare in Swedish.
[02:40:00.157 --> 02:40:09.925]  He's a policeman and investigator, criminal investigator, in a city called Örebro, happened to be a city I grew up in.
[02:40:10.605 --> 02:40:18.969]  And he posted a Facebook post that seems to be the turning point for the, they're calling it, some people are calling it the Swedish Spring.
[02:40:18.969 --> 02:40:24.972]  I think he posted it on February 3rd, and the words have become iconic.
[02:40:24.972 --> 02:40:33.056]  It's gotten translated in the West as, I'm so effing tired, but it's actually a bit softer in the original Swedish.
[02:40:33.056 --> 02:40:36.217]  Really, it's like saying, I'm so damn tired, right?
[02:40:36.217 --> 02:40:39.279]  So he says, I'm so damn tired, essentially, of having
[02:40:39.759 --> 02:40:41.400]  To lie.
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:44.142]  It's not even lie, it's repress.
[02:40:44.142 --> 02:40:47.124]  This is like the headquarters of repression on the planet.
[02:40:47.124 --> 02:40:48.705]  He's tired of turning his will over.
[02:40:48.705 --> 02:41:02.834]  Okay, this is where I still have to unpack and investigate exactly what the law says, but there are codes here in Sweden that preclude police investigators from
[02:41:03.470 --> 02:41:08.292]  Indicating the ethnicity of the people perpetrating the crimes.
[02:41:08.292 --> 02:41:08.892]  Or religion.
[02:41:08.892 --> 02:41:13.574]  In fact, it was in the news last year that they've told the Swedes, don't report Muslim crimes, basically.
[02:41:13.574 --> 02:41:15.935]  Or don't put it in the database that it was Muslims.
[02:41:15.935 --> 02:41:19.057]  And they just say, oh look, Swedish men are raping more women all of a sudden.
[02:41:19.057 --> 02:41:21.017]  It's up a thousand percent the last ten years.
[02:41:21.017 --> 02:41:22.018]  Well, it's not Swedish men.
[02:41:24.274 --> 02:41:28.978]  Here's how it comes across when you're here looking at a newspaper stand.
[02:41:28.978 --> 02:41:34.922]  It'll just say the crime, and the faces are always pixelated.
[02:41:34.922 --> 02:41:37.944]  There's never any identifying factors whatsoever.
[02:41:37.944 --> 02:41:39.906]  I want to tell you something.
[02:41:39.906 --> 02:41:46.871]  I went to get to a juice bar today here in a city called Uppsala, and a gentleman who made my juice
[02:41:47.731 --> 02:41:48.753]  I don't know.
[02:42:02.841 --> 02:42:04.183]  Because he's under severe attack.
[02:42:04.183 --> 02:42:06.886]  He's under criminal investigation for his Facebook post.
[02:42:06.886 --> 02:42:07.747]  They fire him.
[02:42:07.747 --> 02:42:09.850]  I'll raise the money.
[02:42:09.850 --> 02:42:13.775]  I'll spearhead the movement to raise the money to a fundraiser for him.
[02:42:13.775 --> 02:42:18.161]  Because he said, what's happened with all this political correctness is that
[02:42:19.176 --> 02:42:24.619]  Law-abiding Swedish immigrants are suffering every single day.
[02:42:24.619 --> 02:42:24.999]  Exactly.
[02:42:24.999 --> 02:42:25.519]  Let's be clear.
[02:42:25.519 --> 02:42:28.600]  This hurts all the good immigrants that people need and want.
[02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:37.204]  Just saying, here's millions of totally unvetted military zone-age men screaming Allah Akbar, letting in a bunch of barbarians.
[02:42:37.204 --> 02:42:37.845]  It's insane.
[02:42:38.678 --> 02:42:39.698]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:42:39.698 --> 02:42:41.539]  So this isn't working for anybody.
[02:42:41.539 --> 02:42:48.541]  It's like a politically correct super experiment gone disastrous.
[02:42:48.541 --> 02:42:50.582]  They're creating racism.
[02:42:50.582 --> 02:42:53.623]  I don't think Swedish people are racist.
[02:42:53.623 --> 02:42:57.244]  Sure, but it's going to trigger survival mechanisms.
[02:42:57.244 --> 02:43:02.566]  When you turn on the news here and it's like, kill the whites, whites are inherently bad, and it's white people running it.
[02:43:02.566 --> 02:43:06.867]  There's clearly a plan and it's to put people into racial groups for control.
[02:43:07.964 --> 02:43:09.184]  Well, exactly.
[02:43:09.184 --> 02:43:11.905]  And it's like the racism of low expectation.
[02:43:11.905 --> 02:43:15.427]  And now it's the racism of, oh, you can't even say anything.
[02:43:15.427 --> 02:43:16.907]  You can't have a newspaper headline.
[02:43:16.907 --> 02:43:20.888]  A policeman can't say what crime he's investigating.
[02:43:20.888 --> 02:43:24.690]  So that just creates this super creepy feeling, which you have in the whole country now.
[02:43:25.530 --> 02:43:27.233]  What are we being so quiet about?
[02:43:27.233 --> 02:43:31.058]  And it just makes everybody crazy.
[02:43:31.058 --> 02:43:35.084]  Would you say though that the Swedes are really under the surface, getting ready to burst out?
[02:43:35.084 --> 02:43:36.506]  I mean, I've been hearing that's happening.
[02:43:36.506 --> 02:43:38.249]  I want to give you some stats on that.
[02:43:38.249 --> 02:43:38.309]  Yes.
[02:43:42.054 --> 02:43:43.094]  It isn't happening.
[02:43:43.094 --> 02:43:43.975]  It has happened.
[02:43:43.975 --> 02:43:45.215]  And here's how it has happened.
[02:43:45.215 --> 02:43:50.077]  This guy, Peter Springer, this guy put this Facebook post up.
[02:43:50.077 --> 02:43:58.620]  The group in a couple of days has gotten, I think the number is up to about 160,000 followers.
[02:43:58.620 --> 02:44:03.102]  And that's a lot for people there because nobody would ever criticize the government or the state.
[02:44:03.102 --> 02:44:04.582]  So that's a huge deal.
[02:44:04.582 --> 02:44:04.822]  Never.
[02:44:04.822 --> 02:44:08.964]  So they're kind of signing their modern Declaration of Independence against political correctness.
[02:44:09.795 --> 02:44:10.576]  Yes, they are.
[02:44:10.576 --> 02:44:18.705]  And it's scary for them because you stand accused, and this is very real, of being a racist.
[02:44:19.255 --> 02:44:28.062]  If you support, this has been the absolute mantra anywhere you go in society where people say, and I have this discussion with friends and they say too, it just always comes up.
[02:44:28.062 --> 02:44:38.870]  Well, if we stress the ethnicity of the people committing these crimes, a reasonable person could argue that's going to create, you know, racial tension and racial hatred.
[02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:45.175]  But the opposite has been, it's the immigrants that want this PC nonsense to stop.
[02:44:46.276 --> 02:44:47.517]  It's worse than nonsense.
[02:44:47.517 --> 02:44:49.018]  It's more malicious than nonsense.
[02:44:49.018 --> 02:44:49.478]  Exactly.
[02:44:49.478 --> 02:44:50.598]  In fact, let's go over some of these numbers.
[02:44:50.598 --> 02:44:53.620]  But first, let's scroll back to one of his letters that's gotten him in trouble.
[02:44:53.620 --> 02:44:59.983]  I don't know if you can see it on your screen, but if not, we'll read some of it, where he's talking about what it's like.
[02:44:59.983 --> 02:45:01.624]  Our retirees are on its knees.
[02:45:01.624 --> 02:45:03.585]  The school is one of chaos.
[02:45:03.585 --> 02:45:05.286]  Healthcare is an inferno.
[02:45:05.286 --> 02:45:06.787]  Police have been completely destroyed.
[02:45:06.787 --> 02:45:08.248]  Well, it's collapsed Europe, folks.
[02:45:08.248 --> 02:45:08.968]  Etc, etc.
[02:45:08.968 --> 02:45:09.649]  Everyone knows.
[02:45:10.669 --> 02:45:13.370]  Why, but no one dares or wants to peddle reason.
[02:45:13.370 --> 02:45:15.050]  Folks, five million in Europe, okay?
[02:45:15.050 --> 02:45:16.991]  Western Europe alone.
[02:45:16.991 --> 02:45:18.552]  French roads are shutting down.
[02:45:18.552 --> 02:45:19.752]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:45:19.752 --> 02:45:37.118]  Because Sweden has always lived on the myth of the magnificent ultimate society that has unlimited resources to be in the forefront when it comes to being the only politically correct opinion in the dysfunctional world that bend over herself through the destructive behavior of various religions' names.
[02:45:37.538 --> 02:45:38.179]  Here we go.
[02:45:38.179 --> 02:45:38.579]  That's right.
[02:45:38.579 --> 02:45:40.000]  Political correctness is a new religion.
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:40.660]  It's a cult.
[02:45:40.660 --> 02:45:42.281]  So say Sweden's been under cults.
[02:45:42.281 --> 02:45:43.823]  He's saying now it's under a new one.
[02:45:43.823 --> 02:45:45.184]  Here we go.
[02:45:45.184 --> 02:45:47.705]  This I have handled Monday, Friday, this week.
[02:45:47.705 --> 02:45:48.146]  Rape.
[02:45:48.146 --> 02:45:48.806]  Rape.
[02:45:48.806 --> 02:45:49.607]  Aggravated rape.
[02:45:49.607 --> 02:45:50.067]  Assault.
[02:45:50.067 --> 02:45:50.347]  Rape.
[02:45:50.347 --> 02:45:50.828]  Extortion.
[02:45:50.828 --> 02:45:51.588]  Blackmail.
[02:45:51.588 --> 02:45:53.189]  Abuse on judicial procedure.
[02:45:53.189 --> 02:45:54.070]  Unlawful threats.
[02:45:54.070 --> 02:45:55.431]  Violence against the police.
[02:45:55.431 --> 02:45:56.371]  The threat to the police.
[02:45:56.371 --> 02:45:57.532]  Drug trafficking.
[02:45:57.532 --> 02:45:58.633]  Aggravated drug offenses.
[02:45:58.633 --> 02:45:59.374]  Attempted murder.
[02:45:59.374 --> 02:45:59.674]  Rape.
[02:45:59.674 --> 02:46:00.394]  Rape.
[02:46:00.394 --> 02:46:01.575]  Again, extortion.
[02:46:01.575 --> 02:46:02.556]  And he goes on to explain.
[02:46:02.876 --> 02:46:07.141]  Suspected perpetrators, Ali Mohammed, Mohammed, Mohammed, Mohammed, Ali again, again, again.
[02:46:07.141 --> 02:46:09.944]  It's just over and over again, but he's not supposed to say it.
[02:46:09.944 --> 02:46:11.926]  Mohammed, Mohammed, Ali again and again and again.
[02:46:11.926 --> 02:46:13.567]  And where are they coming from?
[02:46:13.567 --> 02:46:19.594]  Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Somalia, Syria again, Somalia, unknown country, unknown, unknown, Sweden.
[02:46:20.765 --> 02:46:22.106]  So finally, somebody from Sweden.
[02:46:22.106 --> 02:46:26.871]  Half of the suspects we cannot know for sure because they have no valid papers.
[02:46:26.871 --> 02:46:27.992]  Which again, Trump's pointing out.
[02:46:27.992 --> 02:46:30.315]  They go, oh you're lying, they're all valid, they're all valid.
[02:46:30.315 --> 02:46:33.978]  Which itself often means that they lie about nationality and identity.
[02:46:33.978 --> 02:46:34.659]  Wow, powerful.
[02:46:34.659 --> 02:46:35.340]  Please continue, ma'am.
[02:46:36.141 --> 02:46:44.748]  He, so yeah, so what happened after that, so he got this huge, not only storm of support on Facebook.
[02:46:44.748 --> 02:46:47.750]  And let's just be clear, Sweden's an incredibly low crime country.
[02:46:47.750 --> 02:46:50.953]  That's why this is so shocking for one investigator in one week.
[02:46:50.953 --> 02:46:51.233]  Go ahead.
[02:46:52.148 --> 02:46:57.171]  Yeah, huge support on Facebook, huge support on social media.
[02:46:57.171 --> 02:46:58.992]  And this, I think, is so fascinating.
[02:46:58.992 --> 02:47:01.933]  Flowers started to pour into the police station.
[02:47:01.933 --> 02:47:05.435]  Just, you know, hundreds of bouquets of flowers.
[02:47:05.435 --> 02:47:07.436]  And this is unusual.
[02:47:07.436 --> 02:47:08.737]  This kind of stuff doesn't really go on.
[02:47:08.737 --> 02:47:10.858]  So it makes it safe for him to speak out.
[02:47:10.858 --> 02:47:13.460]  If they can't burn him, then it makes it safe for everybody.
[02:47:13.460 --> 02:47:15.741]  And the dam of oppression and bullying collapses.
[02:47:16.940 --> 02:47:17.441]  Precisely.
[02:47:17.441 --> 02:47:18.523]  But listen what happened next.
[02:47:18.523 --> 02:47:19.805]  You may know this already.
[02:47:19.805 --> 02:47:23.050]  They, in fact, you probably reported on it before.
[02:47:23.050 --> 02:47:29.080]  They tried, somebody in the police station said there's a ban now on taking pictures of the flowers.
[02:47:29.080 --> 02:47:30.142]  So you are not allowed.
[02:47:30.677 --> 02:47:32.518]  They just invent laws now as they go.
[02:47:32.518 --> 02:47:34.920]  You can't take pictures of flowers!
[02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:37.662]  But people did anyway, and they leaked out anyway.
[02:47:37.662 --> 02:47:39.683]  And why can't we take pictures of flowers?
[02:47:39.683 --> 02:47:42.105]  Oh, because you don't know what could be in the flowers.
[02:47:42.105 --> 02:47:44.927]  It could be some security threat.
[02:47:44.927 --> 02:47:46.588]  So it gets comical.
[02:47:46.588 --> 02:47:47.969]  It's getting really comical.
[02:47:47.969 --> 02:47:49.290]  So these flowers are pouring in.
[02:47:49.290 --> 02:47:53.834]  Meanwhile, he's under criminal investigation for... There's a Swedish law.
[02:47:53.834 --> 02:47:55.875]  I'm going to say it in Swedish and then explain what it is.
[02:47:55.875 --> 02:47:56.576]  It's called HETS.
[02:47:57.156 --> 02:48:01.159]  Really all it means now is you have no free speech when a group's overrunning you.
[02:48:01.159 --> 02:48:02.920]  That doesn't follow such an open society.
[02:48:15.802 --> 02:48:32.799]  Right, but really what the people he's expressing rage against is not any particular ethnicity or religion, it's his bosses at the police house that are censoring him and gagging him so he can't function as a police officer.
[02:48:32.799 --> 02:48:39.706]  So this guy's a modern Paul Revere, it's a huge international story, do you think he'll hang on or are they so arrogant they're going to fire him?
[02:48:41.037 --> 02:48:47.205]  I don't think they're going to fire him.
[02:48:47.205 --> 02:48:48.666]  They're going to make him suffer.
[02:48:48.666 --> 02:48:51.450]  They're going to make him walk the plank of shame.
[02:48:51.450 --> 02:48:53.592]  There are a lot of editorials.
[02:48:53.592 --> 02:48:56.756]  He should just quit and start his own media organization and expose the whole thing.
[02:48:58.044 --> 02:49:00.726]  What I do think, though, is that... He'd be flooded with money.
[02:49:00.726 --> 02:49:01.787]  See, here's the answer.
[02:49:01.787 --> 02:49:02.808]  Use economy against him.
[02:49:02.808 --> 02:49:04.349]  If I was him, I'd say, that's it.
[02:49:04.349 --> 02:49:05.770]  I'm not in my own news organization.
[02:49:05.770 --> 02:49:07.131]  In fact, I'll even leave Sweden.
[02:49:07.131 --> 02:49:13.977]  But I'm going to beam it in over the internet, right into you, with citizens sending me data, as the Citizen Intelligence Corps.
[02:49:13.977 --> 02:49:20.362]  And we're going to expose the whole thing and have migrants that are good migrants, you know, right there with them, working with the Citizen Corps, to expose it.
[02:49:20.362 --> 02:49:21.062]  Victory!
[02:49:21.062 --> 02:49:21.523]  That's the plan.
[02:49:22.363 --> 02:49:24.404]  Let me tell you what else has happened, really fascinating.
[02:49:24.404 --> 02:49:36.690]  A lot of people on the Facebook support page said, so the mainstream media are attacking, attacking, attacking, saying he's racist, saying he's pretending he cares about police work, but really he's just a racist who's waiting to jump out as a racist.
[02:49:36.690 --> 02:49:39.351]  So he's being attacked by mainstream media all over the place.
[02:49:39.351 --> 02:49:46.374]  People on the Facebook page, and this is, you know, thousands of people are saying that they are deleting their apps for these major magazines.
[02:49:46.454 --> 02:49:51.679]  And other people were saying, I haven't had those apps, I haven't read those trash publications in years, but I'm going to download the app just so I can cancel it.
[02:50:05.752 --> 02:50:08.515]  I've never seen Swedes like this.
[02:50:08.515 --> 02:50:09.756]  I've never seen them sound like this.
[02:50:09.756 --> 02:50:21.147]  Well that's why they put an oppressive culture over them because they're like really actually aggressive Germanic tribes and they've been under control just like the Brits have and others and then once they break out of it everybody will see why those social controls were put in place.
[02:50:21.803 --> 02:50:22.643]  They're terrified.
[02:50:22.643 --> 02:50:24.084]  I think they're genuinely terrified.
[02:50:24.084 --> 02:50:26.845]  They really do not want to be, they don't want to hurt anybody.
[02:50:26.845 --> 02:50:27.805]  They don't want to be racist.
[02:50:27.805 --> 02:50:33.127]  The average Swede is genuinely afraid of like, what if I talk about this stuff?
[02:50:33.127 --> 02:50:35.148]  And, you know, I make things worse.
[02:50:35.148 --> 02:50:39.510]  Peter Sutherland said, we're going to flood Sweden to make an anti-European.
[02:50:39.510 --> 02:50:41.430]  So we're not bringing people in there to live in peace together.
[02:50:41.430 --> 02:50:43.611]  The plan is to make us fight with each other.
[02:50:43.611 --> 02:50:50.414]  So you're actually fighting racism to fight the UN program to create the balkanized, destroyed culture that doesn't work together.
[02:50:50.854 --> 02:50:52.995]  We'll be back with our guest.
[02:50:52.995 --> 02:50:54.616]  We'll hear exactly what you want to say next.
[02:50:54.616 --> 02:50:56.578]  Riveting information straight ahead.

[02:54:33.464 --> 02:54:45.355]  There's a global corporate management system, it's in all the WikiLeaks, but it's in a bunch of books they've written where they're gonna bring in groups, teach us not to work together, use the West Open Society to bring it down.
[02:54:45.355 --> 02:54:48.698]  That's why Soros calls his group the Open Society and all this.
[02:54:48.698 --> 02:54:50.559]  It's the opposite of that, it's to bring down the West.
[02:54:50.559 --> 02:54:51.760]  He admits that.
[02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:53.242]  He tries to crash economies.
[02:54:53.242 --> 02:54:54.563]  He's a horrible person.
[02:54:54.563 --> 02:54:57.906]  He's a former Nazi collaborator.
[02:54:57.906 --> 02:54:59.888]  And it's so diabolical you can't make this up.
[02:55:01.049 --> 02:55:02.990]  We'll have our guest with us in about five minutes to the next hour.
[02:55:02.990 --> 02:55:06.392]  Then John Rapoport's going to get into what colleges really are today.
[02:55:06.392 --> 02:55:08.213]  I'm all for higher education.
[02:55:08.213 --> 02:55:09.814]  But more and more, it's not higher education.
[02:55:09.814 --> 02:55:10.475]  It's a scam.
[02:55:10.475 --> 02:55:15.078]  90% of the degrees won't get you a job that pays for it.
[02:55:15.078 --> 02:55:16.659]  And it's nothing but social engineering.
[02:55:16.659 --> 02:55:18.580]  So we need to expose it to reform.
[02:55:18.580 --> 02:55:21.682]  And people say, my son's like, Dad, you're against me going to college.
[02:55:21.682 --> 02:55:24.904]  I'm like, no, son, there aren't a lot of colleges left.
[02:55:24.904 --> 02:55:26.184]  Unless you're going to be a doctor or a lawyer.
[02:55:26.184 --> 02:55:28.206]  They don't teach it or engineering.
[02:55:28.206 --> 02:55:29.667]  Liberal arts has been ruined.
[02:55:30.444 --> 02:55:31.886]  So I want you to understand that.
[02:55:31.886 --> 02:55:32.827]  I want you to go to college.
[02:55:32.827 --> 02:55:38.074]  But you need to understand, go there to be an educator and inform them about what the colleges have become.
[02:55:38.074 --> 02:55:39.796]  It's weird I'm getting that old.
[02:55:39.796 --> 02:55:41.118]  My son's looking at colleges now.
[02:55:41.118 --> 02:55:43.161]  But that's what we're dealing with here.
[02:55:43.161 --> 02:55:44.382]  Please support the broadcast.
[02:55:45.390 --> 02:55:53.395]  We have great high-quality, non-fluoride, organic toothpaste made in America with iodine, ankyloyl, silver, super blue, back in stock.

[02:56:06.822 --> 02:56:08.583]  That's importrestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:56:14.215 --> 02:56:21.622]  Now, Celia Farber, again as a journalist, Truthbearer.com, we have about three minutes in this segment, five in the next, but run with it now.
[02:56:21.622 --> 02:56:24.364]  I've been interrupting a lot because your points are all so important.
[02:56:24.364 --> 02:56:30.990]  About the front line of the fight for human awakening and free speech is Sweden.
[02:56:30.990 --> 02:56:33.472]  You're an American Swede back in Sweden.
[02:56:33.472 --> 02:56:37.536]  This tipping point, this explosion of awakening you're witnessing, please continue.
[02:56:39.264 --> 02:56:40.965]  Yeah, fascinating.
[02:56:40.965 --> 02:56:47.568]  There's this policeman, Peter Spadignano, who I just heard, people are calling a folk hero, and he is.
[02:56:47.568 --> 02:56:54.331]  There was a woman, fascinating story, happened about three weeks ago that preceded him.
[02:56:54.331 --> 02:56:58.413]  And I guess you could call them co-belligerents, co-folk heroes.
[02:56:58.413 --> 02:57:01.655]  She, her name is, she's an author of children's books.
[02:57:01.655 --> 02:57:04.276]  Her name is Katarina Janusz.
[02:57:04.276 --> 02:57:07.558]  She's Czech, grew up in Sweden since she was a child.
[02:57:08.198 --> 02:57:18.007]  And she was doing an interview on Czech television, in Czech, and she described the collapse of the Swedish infrastructure, which you just depicted.
[02:57:18.007 --> 02:57:21.170]  And she gave statistics, and it was not inflammatory.
[02:57:21.170 --> 02:57:22.652]  I've read the text.
[02:57:22.652 --> 02:57:24.133]  It translated to English.
[02:57:24.133 --> 02:57:30.499]  Yeah, completely politely, Europe's being overweighed and its infrastructure, the best in the world, is disintegrating.
[02:57:31.496 --> 02:57:32.917]  This is what happened.
[02:57:32.917 --> 02:57:42.981]  The thought police, they saw the interview and she was absolutely lambasted in Swedish media, the main newspapers, they wrote editorials against her.
[02:57:42.981 --> 02:57:47.963]  And at least one bookstore, if not more, got rid of her books, wouldn't sell her books.
[02:57:47.963 --> 02:57:52.105]  So there's this campaign, this pogrom against her.
[02:57:52.105 --> 02:57:54.586]  And what they said, here's the crux of it.
[02:57:54.586 --> 02:57:59.589]  They said, you know, her facts were incorrect and she was inciting racial
[02:58:00.970 --> 02:58:09.257]  Yeah, you bring in 5 million people from third world countries and they run around raping and burning stuff and crapping on the street.
[02:58:09.257 --> 02:58:10.158]  That's going to hurt your country.
[02:58:11.203 --> 02:58:13.464]  Well, so it was like a thought crime incident.
[02:58:13.464 --> 02:58:19.865]  But what I see, what they're really saying, they're not saying, you're not allowed to say these things about other ethnicities.
[02:58:19.865 --> 02:58:23.927]  What they're saying is, you're not allowed to say these things about Sweden.
[02:58:23.927 --> 02:58:28.248]  Which brings us to the other thing that everybody who's here knows this about this country.
[02:58:28.248 --> 02:58:31.389]  Extremely touchy about their reputation.
[02:58:31.389 --> 02:58:32.829]  Very thin-skinned.
[02:58:32.829 --> 02:58:33.609]  But it's backfiring on them.
[02:58:33.609 --> 02:58:33.949]  No, that's right.
[02:58:33.949 --> 02:58:35.950]  But they're the ones wrecking the country.
[02:58:36.750 --> 02:58:39.711]  Turning it into SwedenStan, so that's their problem.
[02:58:39.711 --> 02:58:41.472]  You're trying to save Sweden.
[02:58:41.472 --> 02:58:42.212]  We'll be back.
[02:58:42.212 --> 02:58:43.953]  Bring in people from all over the world.
[02:58:43.953 --> 02:58:45.374]  Take the Japanese.
[02:58:45.374 --> 02:58:46.394]  You got a bad record?
[02:58:46.394 --> 02:58:47.335]  You don't have a good record?
[02:58:47.335 --> 02:58:48.775]  You're not coming into Japan.
[02:58:48.775 --> 02:58:49.396]  We'll be back.
[02:58:49.396 --> 02:58:49.856]  Stay with us.
[02:58:51.155 --> 02:58:54.379]  We have a priest in New Jersey who is starting to sound like one of us.
[02:58:54.379 --> 02:59:00.625]  Father Peter West, a Catholic priest in the Archdiocese of Newark, is an avid Trump supporter and not afraid to show it.
[02:59:00.625 --> 02:59:07.633]  This is a priest who posts on social media daily, taking on such topics as radical Islam, millennial safe spaces, and modern-day liberals.
[02:59:07.873 --> 02:59:14.360]  Now Father West has fallen under scrutiny from some of his colleagues who believe he is acting inappropriately and has gone too far.
[02:59:14.360 --> 02:59:16.161]  In 2004, a former St.
[02:59:16.161 --> 02:59:25.631]  Louis Archbishop, Cardinal Raymond Burke, took a hard political stance when he refused to allow the at-the-time Senator John Kerry to receive communion for his pro-choice views.
[02:59:25.631 --> 02:59:27.633]  Now, Burke is an avid Trump supporter,
[02:59:27.813 --> 02:59:29.674]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:12.336 --> 03:00:16.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:16.680 --> 03:00:19.022]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:44.452 --> 03:01:00.985]  Alright, Joe Rogan just sent me a text and I still can't talk about it but speaking of censorship in Sweden, he has the most downloaded podcast in history and iTunes did finally update the top podcast of all time.
[03:01:00.985 --> 03:01:03.587]  It's not even listed in there.
[03:01:03.587 --> 03:01:05.449]  So it's the top one ever.
[03:01:05.449 --> 03:01:07.911]  They're not listing it on YouTube either in the trending.
[03:01:07.911 --> 03:01:09.592]  It's all been blocked out.
[03:01:09.592 --> 03:01:10.333]  It's been censored.
[03:01:10.333 --> 03:01:11.474]  A lot of people on Google Play
[03:01:13.932 --> 03:01:18.435]  And I'll talk to Joe after the show here.
[03:01:18.435 --> 03:01:21.958]  Rappaport's coming up and we're going to air a key report on Code Next.
[03:01:21.958 --> 03:01:24.879]  This is the next level of Agenda 21.
[03:01:24.879 --> 03:01:28.442]  But man, I tell you, there are so many censorship articles here in the U.S.
[03:01:28.442 --> 03:01:34.066]  now that we look at Europe or Sweden, who's one of the worst, and say, oh, look at them.
[03:01:34.066 --> 03:01:35.707]  It's already here, but it's stealth.
[03:01:36.892 --> 03:01:38.752]  Here they don't even say, oh, you're censored.
[03:01:38.752 --> 03:01:40.753]  They just start censoring you.
[03:01:40.753 --> 03:01:43.613]  And Joe Rogan is in like 20 big movies.
[03:01:43.613 --> 03:01:46.874]  He's hosted five number one TV shows.
[03:01:46.874 --> 03:01:48.274]  He's the host of the UFC.
[03:01:48.274 --> 03:01:50.195]  He's one of the top comedians in the country.
[03:01:50.195 --> 03:01:54.476]  He sells out arenas of 20,000 people.
[03:01:54.476 --> 03:01:57.876]  His podcast, hundreds of millions of people download it a month.
[03:01:57.876 --> 03:01:59.777]  The biggest one he's ever had.
[03:01:59.777 --> 03:02:00.957]  And it is censored.
[03:02:02.227 --> 03:02:05.369]  Because again, you go on the charts, that's how you get even bigger.
[03:02:05.369 --> 03:02:09.110]  So he has like the number one song, but it's not on the charts.
[03:02:09.110 --> 03:02:11.091]  But they're playing it on the radio.
[03:02:11.091 --> 03:02:12.292]  And he's now investigated.
[03:02:12.292 --> 03:02:13.392]  I just talked to him during the break.
[03:02:13.392 --> 03:02:14.613]  He is pissed.
[03:02:14.613 --> 03:02:16.294]  But I'm not supposed to talk about the details.
[03:02:16.294 --> 03:02:19.315]  I've been sent screenshots of everything until he gives me the green light.
[03:02:19.315 --> 03:02:24.258]  But man, it's weird to be number one and just have it all ignored.
[03:02:25.410 --> 03:02:27.251]  And watch all these peacocks on the news.
[03:02:27.251 --> 03:02:31.215]  It's just it's but there are a million viewers an hour like there's something.
[03:02:31.215 --> 03:02:35.978]  Getting back to our guest, I want to have you back for a full hour soon to get into more of this.
[03:02:35.978 --> 03:02:40.382]  But just just just finishing up with what you were getting into.
[03:02:40.382 --> 03:02:42.043]  Well, I was just reporting a story.
[03:02:42.043 --> 03:02:49.489]  It's going to come out in The Spectator that actually goes against what all of us think is going on with immigration in Sweden.
[03:02:49.489 --> 03:02:50.850]  Very shocking.
[03:02:50.850 --> 03:02:53.372]  Turns out they have a new
[03:02:54.468 --> 03:03:08.492]  They have new developments in their immigration and deportation laws that make what Trump attackers think of Trump, they make it all look like, you know, Sesame Street, Mr. Rogers.
[03:03:08.492 --> 03:03:10.853]  They deport minors.
[03:03:12.179 --> 03:03:14.600]  Back to war zones from Sweden.
[03:03:14.600 --> 03:03:15.360]  This is as of 2016.
[03:03:15.360 --> 03:03:17.681]  This is complicated.
[03:03:17.681 --> 03:03:22.583]  Hopefully we can do this more in another show, but I just found out about it.
[03:03:22.583 --> 03:03:24.544]  There was a big story that caught my attention.
[03:03:24.544 --> 03:03:33.808]  There was a nine-year-old girl who was going to, she was on the cover of the papers, she was going to be deported back to Morocco alone, away from her mother, her siblings, and her stepfathers.
[03:03:33.808 --> 03:03:35.009]  Made no sense.
[03:03:35.009 --> 03:03:39.811]  So there's bizarre things happening in immigration law that have to do with
[03:03:41.031 --> 03:03:41.652]  No, I get it.
[03:03:41.652 --> 03:03:44.073]  We should be taking in children and women.
[03:03:44.073 --> 03:03:47.455]  We shouldn't be taking in foaming at the mouth, crazy 25-year-old jihadi men.
[03:03:47.455 --> 03:03:48.415]  So where's the feminism there?
[03:03:48.415 --> 03:03:50.056]  Why is it mainly men being brought in?
[03:03:50.056 --> 03:03:50.996]  Because they can get there.
[03:04:07.472 --> 03:04:16.660]  And they're breaking their own, they were the one, one of the first countries to sign the UN, I forget what it's called exactly, the convention something, you know, the protection of children.
[03:04:16.660 --> 03:04:20.463]  And they've gone against it and Amnesty International has denounced them.
[03:04:20.463 --> 03:04:26.369]  So there's just like weird dark strain in the midst of, we all think Sweden is just rolling over and being so nice.
[03:04:26.369 --> 03:04:27.630]  They're not being so nice.
[03:04:28.130 --> 03:04:30.171]  No, I got it.
[03:04:30.171 --> 03:04:31.272]  This is testing everything.
[03:04:31.272 --> 03:04:35.994]  The globalists plan to implode borders worldwide, then exploit the lower wages of everybody.
[03:04:35.994 --> 03:04:38.535]  And let's face it, not to be politically correct, this is true.
[03:04:38.535 --> 03:04:49.280]  It's the third world populations that are the most exploited in all of this, but it's western lifeboats that have to be kept afloat to actually have true globalism in the future and empower the entire world.
[03:04:49.280 --> 03:04:51.201]  Thank you so much for the time.

[03:04:53.261 --> 03:04:54.242]  Farber, thank you so much.
[03:04:54.542 --> 03:04:56.043]  Coming up, Mr. Rappaport.
[03:04:56.043 --> 03:04:57.463]  Mr. Rappaport, thank you so much.
[03:04:57.463 --> 03:04:59.044]  Big, big show with Rappaport.
[03:04:59.044 --> 03:04:59.704]  ENCODE next.
[03:05:17.890 --> 03:05:24.376]  Now Father West has fallen under scrutiny from some of his colleagues who believe he is acting inappropriately and has gone too far.
[03:05:24.376 --> 03:05:26.177]  In 2004, a former St.
[03:05:26.177 --> 03:05:35.645]  Louis Archbishop, Cardinal Raymond Burke, took a hard political stance when he refused to allow the at-the-time Senator John Kerry to receive communion for his pro-choice views.
[03:05:35.645 --> 03:05:37.647]  Now, Burke is an avid Trump supporter,
[03:05:37.827 --> 03:05:38.347]  We're good to go.
[03:06:00.985 --> 03:06:02.866]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:06:02.866 --> 03:06:04.887]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:06:04.887 --> 03:06:07.808]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:06:07.808 --> 03:06:13.871]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:06:13.871 --> 03:06:23.055]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:06:23.055 --> 03:06:27.897]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.

[03:06:30.578 --> 03:06:38.602]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:06:38.602 --> 03:06:39.563]  The general public doesn't.
[03:06:40.778 --> 03:06:44.162]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:06:44.162 --> 03:06:48.307]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:06:48.307 --> 03:06:55.015]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:06:55.015 --> 03:06:59.120]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.

[03:08:14.159 --> 03:08:22.646]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:08:22.646 --> 03:08:27.029]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:27.029 --> 03:08:31.172]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:08:31.172 --> 03:08:32.734]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:37.040 --> 03:08:40.783]  John Rappaport sitting in here for Alex in the fourth hour.
[03:08:40.783 --> 03:08:50.211]  I'm going to have a big investigative report here and I'm probably going to take up most of the hour with it.
[03:08:50.211 --> 03:09:00.940]  The article which I wrote recently at No More Fake News, the number one mind control program at US colleges.
[03:09:00.940 --> 03:09:02.541]  So we start here.
[03:09:02.541 --> 03:09:05.664]  Everybody knows about this insane
[03:09:07.148 --> 03:09:18.715]  Triggering safe spaces, microaggressions, a fad trend movement that has broken out at colleges.
[03:09:18.715 --> 03:09:32.823]  Oh, you said something, it triggered me, I saw Hollywood, a Halloween costume and I freaked out and now I have to go to a room where they get hot chocolate and play with dolls and little train sets.
[03:09:32.823 --> 03:09:34.063]  I mean, what?
[03:09:34.063 --> 03:09:34.864]  At a college?
[03:09:35.604 --> 03:09:38.206]  A higher institution of learning.
[03:09:38.206 --> 03:09:41.149]  At many colleges, this is happening.
[03:09:41.149 --> 03:09:50.917]  And of course, it goes along with politically correct speech and so on and so forth, but, you know, people are just boggled by this.
[03:09:50.917 --> 03:09:54.480]  What are these kids talking about?
[03:09:54.480 --> 03:10:00.164]  Safe spaces, microaggressions, I'm triggered, I'm triggered, I'm triggered.
[03:10:00.164 --> 03:10:03.147]  You know, where did this come from?
[03:10:03.147 --> 03:10:04.108]  How did it start?
[03:10:05.538 --> 03:10:13.123]  So I've been lurking around in the shadows for a couple of years, piling up information on this.
[03:10:13.123 --> 03:10:17.786]  And I needed a few final pieces and I finally got them.
[03:10:17.786 --> 03:10:20.388]  And then the last piece fell into place.
[03:10:20.388 --> 03:10:26.933]  So I'm going to tell you exactly where all this stuff came from.
[03:10:26.933 --> 03:10:32.877]  From the National Alliance on Mental Illness comes this statistic.
[03:10:34.901 --> 03:10:43.066]  In one year, 25% of all college students in the U.S.
[03:10:43.066 --> 03:10:50.630]  have either been diagnosed with a mental disorder or treated for a mental disorder.
[03:10:50.630 --> 03:10:55.193]  One out of four across the U.S.
[03:10:55.193 --> 03:10:57.334]  in colleges, all colleges.
[03:11:02.028 --> 03:11:04.649]  Let that sink in for a second, okay?
[03:11:04.649 --> 03:11:13.572]  Let us observe a microsecond of silence on that one.
[03:11:13.572 --> 03:11:20.013]  In other words, these colleges and universities have been turned into psychiatric clinics.
[03:11:20.013 --> 03:11:20.974]  Let's face it.
[03:11:20.974 --> 03:11:21.514]  I mean, come on.
[03:11:22.642 --> 03:11:23.943]  That's the story.
[03:11:23.943 --> 03:11:26.163]  That's the underlying story.
[03:11:26.163 --> 03:11:36.627]  Whether it's a diagnosis of ADHD or clinical depression or bipolar or, you know, whatever it is.
[03:11:36.627 --> 03:11:43.070]  And the treatment with highly, highly active toxic drugs.
[03:11:43.070 --> 03:11:45.851]  So what does that do?
[03:11:45.851 --> 03:11:48.472]  That creates a complete culture of victimhood.
[03:11:49.679 --> 03:11:56.261]  I don't care what Hillary Clinton advocates or, you know, who cares?
[03:11:56.261 --> 03:12:00.343]  These kids now can have a right to consider themselves victims.
[03:12:00.343 --> 03:12:02.323]  Well, I have a problem.
[03:12:02.323 --> 03:12:03.644]  And so what's the next step?
[03:12:03.644 --> 03:12:09.366]  Well, this explains why I have a problem, because I have a mental disorder.
[03:12:09.366 --> 03:12:11.166]  Okay, wow, there we go.
[03:12:11.166 --> 03:12:12.947]  I'm off the hook.
[03:12:13.851 --> 03:12:30.938]  Problem studying, don't know who to date or how to introduce myself to somebody or get along, sociability at college, you know, kid doesn't know what to do, all of this, suddenly got the answer.
[03:12:30.938 --> 03:12:38.621]  Because he had these problems and he wandered into the clinic or the infirmary or whatever in the first place and then all of a sudden before he knew it,
[03:12:39.435 --> 03:12:40.715]  Oh, well, and so forth.
[03:12:40.715 --> 03:12:42.156]  We ask you a few questions.
[03:12:42.156 --> 03:12:47.717]  Yes, we'd like you to see a psychiatrist or a psychologist.
[03:12:47.717 --> 03:12:49.097]  He's got a diagnosis.
[03:12:49.097 --> 03:12:52.398]  She's got a diagnosis.
[03:12:52.398 --> 03:12:55.299]  Now, the victim card is right there.
[03:12:55.299 --> 03:12:57.099]  You can play it anytime you want to.
[03:12:57.099 --> 03:12:59.379]  Well, I couldn't turn in the assignment.
[03:12:59.379 --> 03:13:00.920]  No, the dog didn't eat my homework.
[03:13:00.920 --> 03:13:03.240]  I have a mental disorder.
[03:13:03.240 --> 03:13:05.461]  Okay, wow.
[03:13:05.461 --> 03:13:06.041]  Hands off.
[03:13:07.188 --> 03:13:15.014]  Twenty-five percent, get that through your skull, of all students at U.S.
[03:13:15.014 --> 03:13:17.636]  colleges.
[03:13:17.636 --> 03:13:36.571]  Now, with that underlying framework, you see, how easy is it to step from there into a student or students getting together and saying, you know, there's certain things that are going on in the environment here that are upsetting us.
[03:13:38.834 --> 03:13:44.499]  that are triggering us.
[03:13:44.499 --> 03:13:45.160]  Get it?
[03:13:45.160 --> 03:13:49.464]  Because, well, we already have a mental disorder, you see, so we're a little bit off.
[03:13:49.464 --> 03:13:52.327]  Chemical imbalance in the brain, whatever, whatever, whatever.
[03:13:52.327 --> 03:13:56.791]  There you have it.
[03:13:56.791 --> 03:13:57.892]  Now we have a right
[03:13:58.843 --> 03:14:17.694]  to begin talking this crazy language and we need a safe space in a room and the teachers and staff have to attend to us and we can regress back into being children because we've already been diagnosed by a mental health professional as having a mental disorder.
[03:14:17.694 --> 03:14:22.877]  I hope you really get this because this is a key to understanding
[03:14:24.241 --> 03:14:26.842]  What is going on, not only going on at U.S.
[03:14:26.842 --> 03:14:33.145]  colleges and universities, but what is eating out the country from the inside?
[03:14:33.145 --> 03:14:35.526]  The profession of psychiatry.
[03:14:35.526 --> 03:14:44.110]  And I'm going to break all that down for you, chapter and verse, in this investigative report.
[03:14:44.110 --> 03:14:47.952]  But you've got the headline and the top paragraph now.
[03:14:47.952 --> 03:14:52.874]  Now you can see how this whole business came about.
[03:14:54.392 --> 03:15:12.971]  And how, of course, it's destroying the country because if the majority of the best and the brightest attending colleges and universities, 25% of them already at such a young age are being diagnosed with a mental disorder and drugged with highly toxic brain scrambling drugs.
[03:15:15.578 --> 03:15:29.792]  Naturally, some bizarre things are going to come up out of the hopper, such as, I'm triggered, I'm triggered, I'm triggered, I'm triggered, I need to save space, that was a microaggression, he wore a Halloween costume, I'm going psychotic.
[03:15:29.792 --> 03:15:30.994]  You bet.
[03:15:30.994 --> 03:15:33.096]  And the drugs themselves.
[03:15:34.827 --> 03:15:38.288]  Create a distorted perception of reality.
[03:15:38.288 --> 03:15:39.948]  Keep that in mind.
[03:15:39.948 --> 03:15:52.752]  So that some of these reactions that you're seeing from college students that you scratch your head about and just can't figure out are coming from the drugs.
[03:15:52.752 --> 03:15:56.073]  Okay.
[03:15:56.073 --> 03:15:58.314]  Yeah, I'm getting a little worked up about this.
[03:15:58.314 --> 03:15:59.734]  I've been on this case for 20 years now.
[03:15:59.734 --> 03:15:59.974]  20 years.
[03:16:05.660 --> 03:16:29.485]  Before I get to the next piece, which is gigantic, let me make sure that you know that at InfoWarsStore.com you can get Roger Stone's new book, The Making of the President, 20% off, now available for 20% off at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:16:45.010 --> 03:16:46.630]  That story.

[03:17:27.040 --> 03:17:30.184]  Okay.
[03:17:30.184 --> 03:17:31.927]  Next piece here.
[03:17:33.579 --> 03:18:01.190]  If you go to the Psychiatric Bible, and there is a thing called the Psychiatric Bible, its official name is the DSM, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association and updated every few years, you will find that there is a list and a description of roughly
[03:18:02.725 --> 03:18:02.985]  Ready?
[03:18:02.985 --> 03:18:10.889]  300 separate and distinct mental disorders by name.
[03:18:10.889 --> 03:18:18.093]  Oppositional Defiance Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Clinical Depression, etc, etc.
[03:18:18.093 --> 03:18:23.376]  The ones you know about and obviously the vast majority you've never heard of.
[03:18:23.376 --> 03:18:23.516]  300!
[03:18:23.516 --> 03:18:27.098]  Okay?
[03:18:27.098 --> 03:18:30.380]  Now, here's the revelation.
[03:18:32.176 --> 03:18:47.624]  There is no, and listen carefully here, every word is important, there is no defining physical diagnostic test of any kind for any of those 300 so-called mental disorders.
[03:18:50.683 --> 03:18:52.344]  Not a blood test.
[03:18:52.344 --> 03:18:53.544]  Not a hair test.
[03:18:53.544 --> 03:18:54.705]  Not a saliva test.
[03:18:54.705 --> 03:18:56.086]  Not a urine test.
[03:18:56.086 --> 03:18:57.206]  Not a brain scan.
[03:18:57.206 --> 03:18:59.507]  Not a genetic assay.
[03:18:59.507 --> 03:19:00.888]  Nothing.
[03:19:00.888 --> 03:19:01.568]  Zero.
[03:19:01.568 --> 03:19:02.309]  Zilch.
[03:19:02.309 --> 03:19:03.049]  Nada.
[03:19:03.049 --> 03:19:04.650]  Nothing.
[03:19:04.650 --> 03:19:09.532]  This, in fact, is an open secret in the psychiatric community.
[03:19:09.532 --> 03:19:12.254]  They understand this.
[03:19:12.254 --> 03:19:18.497]  So it would be like you going into the doctor and he says, you know, you've got cancer.
[03:19:21.187 --> 03:19:24.731]  Yeah, I think you've got cancer.
[03:19:24.731 --> 03:19:26.653]  You gonna run any tests?
[03:19:26.653 --> 03:19:29.796]  No, we don't actually have any tests.
[03:19:29.796 --> 03:19:41.489]  But from what you say and looking at you, I would say that you've got cancer and it's now time, you know, we could start an hour on some heavy rounds of chemotherapy.
[03:19:41.489 --> 03:19:42.831]  Okay.
[03:19:43.752 --> 03:19:50.037]  Which, of course, will stop the reproduction of all your cells, and we hope it'll kill the tumors before it kills you.
[03:19:50.037 --> 03:19:52.158]  Yeah, but you haven't run any tests.
[03:19:52.158 --> 03:19:53.659]  Well, we don't really have any tests.
[03:19:53.659 --> 03:19:55.341]  It would be like that.
[03:19:55.341 --> 03:19:59.324]  Only instead, you're in the psychiatrist's office.
[03:19:59.324 --> 03:20:00.785]  Stay tuned after the break.
[03:20:00.785 --> 03:20:01.125]  Right back.
[03:20:01.567 --> 03:20:04.131]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[03:20:04.131 --> 03:20:06.294]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[03:20:06.294 --> 03:20:08.256]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[03:20:08.256 --> 03:20:10.319]  Find your happiness with Pure Soap.
[03:20:10.319 --> 03:20:15.186]  These all-natural, earth-friendly Pure Soaps are the very best you've ever used.
[03:20:15.186 --> 03:20:16.067]  Buy in bulk.
[03:20:16.067 --> 03:20:17.069]  Get a 12-, 36- or 48-month supply.

[03:22:00.436 --> 03:22:03.277]  Listen to what Dave Ryan says about Andro 400.
[03:22:03.277 --> 03:22:05.577]  Andro 400, I really love it.
[03:22:05.577 --> 03:22:08.117]  It's amazing to me that I feel so good.
[03:22:08.117 --> 03:22:09.158]  I've lost 50 pounds.
[03:22:09.158 --> 03:22:10.998]  I was a size 38 waist.
[03:22:10.998 --> 03:22:12.658]  I've gone down to a 32 waist.
[03:22:12.658 --> 03:22:13.898]  My mood has changed.
[03:22:13.898 --> 03:22:15.639]  I don't get stressed out.
[03:22:15.639 --> 03:22:17.319]  It gave me so much more energy.
[03:22:17.319 --> 03:22:18.959]  Energy to walk.
[03:22:18.959 --> 03:22:20.940]  Energy to play sports.
[03:22:20.940 --> 03:22:22.220]  Everything is starting to work again.
[03:22:22.220 --> 03:22:23.780]  It feels like I'm 25.
[03:22:23.780 --> 03:22:24.740]  My wife is happy.
[03:22:24.740 --> 03:22:25.580]  I'm so happy.
[03:22:25.580 --> 03:22:27.501]  I'm just a completely different man.
[03:22:27.501 --> 03:22:29.061]  I'm taking this stuff to the grave with me.

[03:23:05.078 --> 03:23:08.499]  I couldn't let Valentine's Day come and go without surprising you with flowers.

[03:23:51.493 --> 03:23:54.497]  Click the blue microphone in the upper right corner and enter secret code 9494.
[03:23:54.497 --> 03:23:55.318]  That's ProFlowers.com, code 9494.
[03:24:11.389 --> 03:24:16.817]  John Rappaport back talking about the number one mind control program at US colleges.
[03:24:18.522 --> 03:24:43.594]  So you've got these 300 so-called mental disorders that are listed in the Psychiatric Bible, and there's no diagnostic test whatsoever for any of them that defines any of the so-called disorders, and that means that a psychiatrist can diagnose you, your child, a student at a college, with anything that he wants to, and then comes the hammer.
[03:24:44.571 --> 03:24:46.753]  The hammer is the drugs.
[03:24:46.753 --> 03:24:56.802]  And in case you're thinking of trying to worm out of my argument here and say, well, but we know that all these mental disorders are chemical imbalances in the brain.
[03:24:56.802 --> 03:24:57.363]  False.
[03:24:57.363 --> 03:24:57.803]  No.
[03:24:57.803 --> 03:24:58.324]  Wrong.
[03:24:58.324 --> 03:24:59.144]  Absolutely wrong.
[03:24:59.144 --> 03:25:03.428]  Because first of all, there is no baseline normal
[03:25:04.429 --> 03:25:33.721]  tests for what a normal baseline chemical balance in the brain is, and I have documented through an admission by Dr. Ronald Pais, who is, you know, one of these erudite psychiatrists with, you know, a resume this long, retired now, emeritus, editor, and so on, who said, oh no, the chemical imbalance theory of mental illness was always an urban myth.
[03:25:35.188 --> 03:25:39.050]  Quote, always an urban myth.
[03:25:39.050 --> 03:25:42.353]  So that doesn't even hold up.
[03:25:42.353 --> 03:25:54.540]  So all these college students, and everybody really, are completely at the mercy of these psychiatrists who will say, well, you've got this disorder, that disorder, and now comes the drugs.
[03:25:54.540 --> 03:25:55.961]  Oh, the antidepressants.
[03:25:55.961 --> 03:25:59.223]  Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, and so forth.
[03:25:59.223 --> 03:26:00.104]  In my article,
[03:26:01.903 --> 03:26:02.143]  I think?
[03:26:16.525 --> 03:26:21.547]  Influence, how they push people over the edge into committing violence.
[03:26:21.547 --> 03:26:31.430]  And when I say violence, yes, could be throwing a rock through a window, but it could also be murder, could also be mass murder, could also be suicide.
[03:26:31.430 --> 03:26:40.333]  We're talking serious stuff here as a result of these SSRI, as they're called, anti-depressants.
[03:26:40.333 --> 03:26:42.394]  And that's just one class of drug.
[03:26:43.783 --> 03:26:51.770]  There are others called major tranquilizers or neuroleptics, the first of which was Thorazine.
[03:26:51.770 --> 03:26:54.253]  We all remember that one.
[03:26:54.253 --> 03:27:00.338]  And we've got others like Haldol and we've got others like Risperdal.
[03:27:00.338 --> 03:27:02.841]  And what are they?
[03:27:02.841 --> 03:27:08.626]  They are creating motor brain damage.
[03:27:08.626 --> 03:27:09.247]  What does that mean?
[03:27:10.225 --> 03:27:19.692]  That means that your ability to move and function physiologically as a human being is damaged by these drugs.
[03:27:19.692 --> 03:27:24.836]  The great reference on this is Peter Bragan's book, Toxic Psychiatry, 1991, St.
[03:27:24.836 --> 03:27:31.902]  Martin's Press, which should be on every bookshelf.
[03:27:31.902 --> 03:27:32.763]  So here you go.
[03:27:32.763 --> 03:27:34.784]  U.S.
[03:27:34.784 --> 03:27:38.287]  colleges.
[03:27:38.287 --> 03:27:39.188]  Mind control.
[03:27:40.865 --> 03:27:45.928]  Psychiatry is basically a mind control operation.
[03:27:45.928 --> 03:27:58.377]  Diagnoses with no tests, completely arbitrary, giving you the sense that you have a mental disorder and now you're a victim and therefore you have certain privileges and rights and so forth.
[03:27:58.377 --> 03:28:01.959]  I'm triggered, I need a safe space, microaggressions.
[03:28:01.959 --> 03:28:04.341]  The drugs are in fact scrambling your brains.
[03:28:06.476 --> 03:28:12.038]  What else do you need to say that psychiatry is a mind control program?
[03:28:12.038 --> 03:28:22.263]  It's the extension of MKUltra of the CIA, their famous mind control program, into the entire society right out in the open.
[03:28:22.263 --> 03:28:26.905]  And as Alex is fond of saying, they're not even trying to hide it anymore.
[03:28:26.905 --> 03:28:28.325]  They're just giving it to you.
[03:28:28.325 --> 03:28:29.426]  Here we are.
[03:28:29.426 --> 03:28:31.967]  And this is what we're doing to you.
[03:28:31.967 --> 03:28:32.647]  Now take it.
[03:28:34.542 --> 03:28:40.206]  So a real revolution is necessary at colleges.
[03:28:40.206 --> 03:28:44.489]  Because if 25% of all college students in the U.S.
[03:28:44.489 --> 03:28:53.896]  are being diagnosed or treated for a mental disorder, these are nothing more than psychiatric clinics.
[03:28:53.896 --> 03:29:00.641]  They are little nests that produce violence and craziness and insanity.
[03:29:00.641 --> 03:29:03.283]  That's where the insanity begins.
[03:29:04.608 --> 03:29:07.210]  That's where it comes up.
[03:29:07.210 --> 03:29:09.111]  Okay.
[03:29:09.111 --> 03:29:21.759]  We're going to take a break in a couple minutes, but I want to tell you, after we come back from the break, stay with us because what I'm talking about is mind control, slavery over the mind.
[03:29:21.759 --> 03:29:32.085]  What Rob do in his report, which is coming right up, is talking about is taking over our physical world through Agenda 21.
[03:29:33.949 --> 03:29:39.152]  The report is called Code Next is Slavery.
[03:29:39.152 --> 03:29:47.976]  You really want to see this one, because of course, Agenda 21 is everywhere in the United States under a variety of disguise.
[03:29:47.976 --> 03:29:48.816]  We'll be back.
[03:29:48.816 --> 03:29:50.557]  Stay with us.
[03:29:50.557 --> 03:29:51.957]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.957 --> 03:29:54.479]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.479 --> 03:29:57.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.212 --> 03:30:05.695]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[03:30:05.695 --> 03:30:16.623]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[03:30:16.803 --> 03:30:21.846]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[03:30:21.846 --> 03:30:24.408]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[03:30:24.408 --> 03:30:25.929]  It helps detoxify.
[03:30:25.929 --> 03:30:29.011]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[03:30:29.011 --> 03:30:33.794]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[03:30:33.794 --> 03:30:40.059]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[03:30:40.059 --> 03:30:45.382]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[03:30:45.382 --> 03:30:46.783]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[03:30:46.783 --> 03:30:48.084]  Okay, this is so key.
[03:30:48.084 --> 03:30:52.406]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[03:30:52.406 --> 03:30:54.608]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[03:30:54.608 --> 03:30:58.069]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:31:01.872 --> 03:31:09.575]  ExtendoVite really works, but you find that hard to believe and you spend precious time looking for someone to say, just try it!
[03:31:09.575 --> 03:31:17.438]  I have my health today because of ExtendoVite, and if I did not take a leap of faith and try it, well, I would be on disability today.
[03:31:17.438 --> 03:31:22.240]  Take one bottle of ExtendoVite as suggested for 60 days to find out for yourself.
[03:31:22.240 --> 03:31:26.902]  No need to stop any other meds you may be on, you know by now that they are not working for you.
[03:31:27.242 --> 03:31:34.005]  Before the 60 days are up, I know that you will feel Xtendivite working for you and will want to take another bottle.
[03:31:34.005 --> 03:31:35.145]  Life is too short!
[03:31:35.145 --> 03:31:37.106]  Get your Xtendivite today!
[03:31:37.106 --> 03:31:42.568]  Xtendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a 2-month supply.

[03:32:59.328 --> 03:33:00.069]  Effective.
[03:33:02.935 --> 03:33:09.521]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:33:26.457 --> 03:33:32.900]  For over 20 years, the UN has been attempting to advance the globalist plan called Agenda 21.
[03:33:32.900 --> 03:33:42.344]  Under the guise of the title Sustainable Development, this state of regulations has been the driving force behind many of the land and business regulations passed in your local community.
[03:33:42.344 --> 03:33:52.189]  Sustainable development almost always results in a community turning over its resources to a small bureaucracy, who through tax and regulation transfer more and more power to themselves.
[03:33:52.489 --> 03:33:59.412]  While many media outlets decry Agenda 21 as a dead letter, we see evidence of the implementation of this plan all the time.
[03:33:59.412 --> 03:34:05.635]  In Austin, Texas, for example, a series of land development rules called Code Next has been pushed for years.
[03:34:05.635 --> 03:34:13.858]  NGOs with an interest in Agenda 21 have been producing videos which could prepare or tone the public for unnatural living scenarios.
[03:34:13.858 --> 03:34:21.782]  One video in particular, Plannedopolis, shows a future world where everything is tracked, traced, and you are only allowed meat on certain days.
[03:34:22.163 --> 03:34:24.873]  What's on the menu this month?
[03:34:24.873 --> 03:34:26.258]  No, not meat.
[03:34:26.258 --> 03:34:27.382]  It's not your birthday.
[03:34:28.522 --> 03:34:33.826]  The Global Food Council are doing a really good job of keeping food production going.
[03:34:33.826 --> 03:34:37.868]  I mean, you don't get the choice you're used to, but we're better off than most.
[03:34:37.868 --> 03:34:43.712]  And if you don't agree with this controlled aspect of living, then you live in the ghettos and are shunned by society.
[03:34:43.712 --> 03:34:45.373]  Now let's look at Code Next.
[03:34:45.373 --> 03:34:48.035]  It's called Code Next.
[03:34:48.035 --> 03:34:51.837]  That's the trendy name for Agenda 21 in Austin, Texas.
[03:34:51.837 --> 03:34:57.021]  Under their Next Code systems, they are.
[03:34:58.320 --> 03:35:04.768]  Openly establishing a planetary system of total control.
[03:35:06.001 --> 03:35:10.885]  Where the individual has absolutely no rights and where your very environment is a prison.
[03:35:10.885 --> 03:35:19.612]  Look into Code Next if you want to understand the global model of Agenda 21 simply using zoning to fully enslave you and your family.
[03:35:19.612 --> 03:35:29.320]  This plan begins by rezoning already existing neighborhoods to meet a new standard that will be compatible with new future plans already outlined in Agenda 21.
[03:35:29.320 --> 03:35:34.684]  Code Next wants to change existing single-family housing developments and implement a new system
[03:35:34.944 --> 03:35:36.465]  This also increases traffic congestion.
[03:36:00.163 --> 03:36:06.285]  So Code Next also makes driving lanes smaller and even adds concrete embankments for bike lanes.
[03:36:06.285 --> 03:36:09.427]  Anything to impede the natural flow of traffic.
[03:36:09.427 --> 03:36:12.348]  But what's the true incentive for programs like Code Next?
[03:36:13.752 --> 03:36:15.393]  So if I vote, will immigration know where I live?
[03:36:15.393 --> 03:36:17.313]  Will they come for my family and deport us?
[03:36:17.313 --> 03:36:17.513]  Not true.
[03:36:17.513 --> 03:36:20.114]  And the reason is, first of all, when you vote,
[03:36:34.359 --> 03:36:44.001]  You are a citizen yourself, and there is not a situation where the voting rolls somehow are transferred over and people start investigating, etc.
[03:36:44.001 --> 03:36:48.082]  The sanctity of the vote is strictly confidential.
[03:36:48.082 --> 03:36:58.844]  And with an abundance of cheap rooms and small coffin-like apartments being built in once middle-class residential communities, you can turn conservative districts into leftist progressive districts.
[03:36:59.104 --> 03:37:24.960]  But they have an admitted plan under Code Next to take over Austin, then take over the surrounding towns like a cancer, take over the I-35 and I-45 corridors, and fully bring in the third world population to drive down wages, to house them in overpriced coffin apartments, and to bring down the standard of living massively, then use those political groups as a checkmate on the rest of the population and kill the middle class once and for all.
[03:37:25.761 --> 03:37:33.182]  It affects every property owner, every renter, everyone that lives in Austin, whether you live inside the city or just outside of our city limits.
[03:37:34.059 --> 03:37:36.240]  Okay, he's talking about Code Next.
[03:37:36.240 --> 03:37:41.803]  The code will reflect what the character of your neighborhood should look like, as well as mobility options.
[03:37:41.803 --> 03:37:47.907]  We talked to Habitat for Humanity, and right now they are waiting to develop this old lumber yard on East 4th Street.
[03:37:47.907 --> 03:37:50.528]  It's just a block or so away from the Metrorail station.
[03:37:50.528 --> 03:37:57.072]  They believe the rewriting of the code will allow them to build more affordable units instead of just single-family homes.
[03:37:57.472 --> 03:38:00.854]  The bureaucrats win by creating a vertical property tax base.
[03:38:00.854 --> 03:38:08.459]  Instead of one house paying one set of property taxes, you now have 400 little apartments all paying tax on the same piece of property.
[03:38:08.459 --> 03:38:16.344]  Breaking apart residential communities and adding small rent-controlled efficiency apartments, popularly known as the projects, can have serious effects on a community as well.
[03:38:16.344 --> 03:38:23.029]  Will a neighborhood of primarily single-family dwellings be subject to increased crime rates that we see in sanctuary cities across the nation?
[03:38:23.029 --> 03:38:25.170]  This is obviously a disaster waiting to happen.
[03:38:25.170 --> 03:38:25.651]  Through Agenda 21,
[03:38:26.371 --> 03:38:31.953]  And it's manifestations like Code Next, we can see the dark cloud of sustainable development consuming us all.
[03:38:31.953 --> 03:38:40.396]  Rob Drew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:38:40.396 --> 03:38:41.576]  John Rapp, report back.
[03:38:41.576 --> 03:38:46.718]  So you saw that terrific report by Rob.
[03:38:46.718 --> 03:38:51.279]  So now think of this in relation to what I've been talking about.
[03:38:51.279 --> 03:38:55.901]  Now you're going to have people desperate, more desperate, and more desperate.
[03:38:57.338 --> 03:39:01.682]  And somebody's going to say, well, you should really see somebody.
[03:39:01.682 --> 03:39:05.606]  You should talk to a professional.
[03:39:05.606 --> 03:39:06.787]  Right?
[03:39:06.787 --> 03:39:09.169]  Oh, it's not what's happening outside in the world.
[03:39:09.169 --> 03:39:10.711]  That has nothing to do with it.
[03:39:10.711 --> 03:39:14.634]  No, it's something, you know, inside your brain.
[03:39:14.634 --> 03:39:15.816]  Get diagnosed.
[03:39:15.816 --> 03:39:19.319]  In other words, why don't they just come out and say, hey, get diagnosed.
[03:39:19.319 --> 03:39:19.899]  What do you say?
[03:39:20.834 --> 03:39:21.815]  Join the crowd.
[03:39:21.815 --> 03:39:22.976]  Everybody loves it.
[03:39:22.976 --> 03:39:25.959]  We're all getting diagnosed this week.
[03:39:25.959 --> 03:39:27.521]  This is Diagnosis Week!
[03:39:28.274 --> 03:39:39.202]  Barack Obama has come out of retirement along with Bill Clinton, a skeletal figure, and they're all saying, along with Hillary Clinton, it takes a village to get diagnosed.
[03:39:39.202 --> 03:39:41.103]  Let's all get diagnosed this week.
[03:39:41.103 --> 03:39:54.433]  This is diagnosis week for mental disorders for the entire population, because now that we're stuffing you into tiny spaces and making you exceedingly claustrophobic and taking away all your money and destroying the middle class,
[03:39:55.233 --> 03:40:00.575]  And basically, you know, gutting the nation.
[03:40:00.575 --> 03:40:03.235]  It's time to get diagnosed, folks.
[03:40:03.235 --> 03:40:08.417]  It really takes a village to get diagnosed.
[03:40:08.417 --> 03:40:11.038]  Yeah, that's the truth.
[03:40:11.038 --> 03:40:18.580]  It takes a village mentality, a global village mentality to get diagnosed.
[03:40:18.580 --> 03:40:19.720]  Yeah, so.
[03:40:22.279 --> 03:40:23.320]  Mind-blowing.
[03:40:23.320 --> 03:40:26.843]  I'm going to try to raise a document up here for myself.
[03:40:26.843 --> 03:40:28.405]  You will not see it, hopefully.
[03:40:28.405 --> 03:40:30.186]  Okay, we're still here.
[03:40:30.186 --> 03:40:35.511]  I'm your basic primitive writer.
[03:40:35.511 --> 03:40:36.172]  Okay.
[03:40:36.172 --> 03:40:44.219]  I want to read you a short passage from Peter Bragan's 1991 book, Toxic Psychiatry.
[03:40:44.219 --> 03:40:46.281]  This is a revelation, okay?
[03:40:46.281 --> 03:40:47.843]  I'm going to excerpt this a little bit.
[03:40:50.359 --> 03:41:00.982]  Roberta was a college student getting good grades, mostly A's, when she first became depressed and sought psychiatric help with the recommendation of her university health service, right?
[03:41:00.982 --> 03:41:02.983]  Talk about Agenda 21.
[03:41:02.983 --> 03:41:08.965]  She was 18 at the time, bright and well-motivated, very good candidate, blah, blah, blah, etc., etc.
[03:41:08.965 --> 03:41:14.847]  Going through a sophomore year identity crisis about dating men, succeeding in school, planning a future.
[03:41:15.757 --> 03:41:16.718]  Okay.
[03:41:16.718 --> 03:41:21.923]  Instead of moral support and insight, her doctor gave her Haldol.
[03:41:21.923 --> 03:41:23.906]  That's an antipsychotic.
[03:41:23.906 --> 03:41:28.570]  That is a neuroleptic, a major tranquilizer.
[03:41:28.570 --> 03:41:30.813]  Those are all names for that class of drugs.
[03:41:30.813 --> 03:41:33.355]  Over the next four years, get this now, listen.
[03:41:34.256 --> 03:41:46.310]  Six different physicians watched her deteriorate neurologically without warning her or her family about tardive dyskinesia, motor brain damage, and without making the diagnosis.
[03:41:48.070 --> 03:41:50.972]  Even when she was overtly twitching in her arms and legs.
[03:41:50.972 --> 03:41:58.296]  Instead, they switched her from one neuroleptic to another, including Nevain, Stelazine, and Thorazine.
[03:41:58.296 --> 03:42:06.941]  Eventually, a rehabilitation therapist became concerned enough to send her to a general physician who made the diagnosis of medical drug damage.
[03:42:06.941 --> 03:42:12.164]  By then, she was permanently physically disabled with a loss of 30% of her IQ.
[03:42:14.665 --> 03:42:18.870]  And then Bregan says, my medical evaluation described her condition.
[03:42:18.870 --> 03:42:25.397]  Grossly disfigured and severely disabled human being who can no longer control her body.
[03:42:25.397 --> 03:42:35.167]  She suffers from extreme writhing movements and spasms involving the face, neck, head, shoulders, limbs, extremities, torso and back, nearly the entire body.
[03:42:35.988 --> 03:42:43.935]  She's had difficulty standing, sitting, or lying down, and the difficulties worsen as she attempts to carry out voluntary actions.
[03:42:43.935 --> 03:42:49.420]  At one point, she could not prevent her head from banging against nearby furniture.
[03:42:49.420 --> 03:42:53.764]  She could hold a lip to her cup only with great difficulty, etc., etc.
[03:42:53.764 --> 03:43:00.390]  Even her respiratory movements are seriously afflicted, so that her speech comes out in grunts and gasps.
[03:43:01.050 --> 03:43:02.551]  Amidst spasms.
[03:43:02.551 --> 03:43:16.255]  Roberta may improve somewhat after several months off the neuroleptic drugs, but she will never again have anything remotely resembling a normal life.
[03:43:16.255 --> 03:43:18.336]  Yeah, okay.
[03:43:18.336 --> 03:43:19.756]  Get it?
[03:43:19.756 --> 03:43:22.737]  Get it?
[03:43:22.737 --> 03:43:29.740]  Now, Bregan warns, and I want you to make sure you understand, withdrawing
[03:43:31.147 --> 03:43:35.593]  rapidly from any psychiatric drug can be worse than taking the drug.
[03:43:35.593 --> 03:43:42.642]  We're talking about very dangerous and even life-threatening problems.
[03:43:42.642 --> 03:43:47.889]  So this is in no way a recommendation to anybody who may be on one of these drugs to just get off of it.
[03:43:49.224 --> 03:43:55.687]  Bregin.com, B-R-E-G-I-N.com is the website of Peter Bregin.
[03:43:55.687 --> 03:43:59.288]  He's written a book about withdrawing from psychiatric drugs.
[03:43:59.288 --> 03:44:05.471]  He recommends it be done by a professional who knows what he's doing, etc.
[03:44:05.471 --> 03:44:07.852]  Okay.
[03:44:07.852 --> 03:44:15.855]  So I think you're probably getting the message now in this investigative report on the number one mind control program at colleges.
[03:44:17.867 --> 03:44:23.670]  And now I want to talk about Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste.
[03:44:23.670 --> 03:44:24.771]  My wife read about this.
[03:44:24.771 --> 03:44:28.192]  She was very enthusiastic.
[03:44:28.192 --> 03:44:34.275]  After being sold out for months at inforwarslife.com, it's back.
[03:44:34.275 --> 03:44:38.898]  GUM's research indicates, can contribute to the development of heart disease, heart attacks,
[03:44:42.093 --> 03:44:50.477]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter the bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots or heart attacks.
[03:44:50.477 --> 03:44:58.721]  That's why the latest Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:44:58.721 --> 03:45:04.004]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste, groundbreaking new formula.
[03:45:05.307 --> 03:45:10.369]  Good halogen iodine instead of bad halogen fluoride.
[03:45:10.369 --> 03:45:21.353]  Contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:45:21.353 --> 03:45:29.016]  Xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nanosilver are just some of the ingredients.
[03:45:29.016 --> 03:45:29.216]  Go!
[03:45:30.660 --> 03:45:37.365]  Support InfoWars.com and get a fantastic product at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:45:37.365 --> 03:45:48.673]  You understand what the situation is here, folks, from what I've been detailing in this investigative report and from what Rob Dew is talking about.
[03:45:48.673 --> 03:45:50.574]  You are the resistance.
[03:45:50.574 --> 03:45:51.855]  We are the resistance.
[03:45:52.870 --> 03:45:59.496]  Here's a way you can support InfoWars and also get a terrific product for your health.
[03:45:59.496 --> 03:46:02.679]  Superblue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[03:46:02.679 --> 03:46:07.062]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:46:07.062 --> 03:46:09.204]  Okay.
[03:46:09.204 --> 03:46:15.690]  What else on this merry voyage through insanity created by psychiatry?
[03:46:17.492 --> 03:46:32.984]  You'll see in the article that I wrote about this up at InfoWars and also at NoMoreFakeNews that even drugs like Ritalin can have fantastically dangerous effects.
[03:46:32.984 --> 03:46:40.070]  Psychotic breaks, aggressive, violent behavior.
[03:46:40.070 --> 03:46:41.011]  And think about this.
[03:46:42.918 --> 03:46:50.641]  This so-called, you know, ADHD, everybody's getting it, get diagnosed, get the drug, sure.
[03:46:50.641 --> 03:46:59.424]  The drugs are very, very closely related to amphetamines.
[03:46:59.424 --> 03:47:01.705]  They are amphetamine-type drugs.
[03:47:03.618 --> 03:47:06.279]  The boys at Infowars now have it up on the screen.
[03:47:06.279 --> 03:47:07.700]  Some of the effects of Ritalin.
[03:47:07.700 --> 03:47:08.840]  Paranoid delusions.
[03:47:08.840 --> 03:47:10.901]  Paranoid psychosis.
[03:47:10.901 --> 03:47:12.402]  Visual hallucinations.
[03:47:12.402 --> 03:47:14.323]  Auditory hallucinations.
[03:47:14.323 --> 03:47:20.185]  Can surpass LSD in producing bizarre experiences.
[03:47:20.185 --> 03:47:21.766]  Extreme withdrawal.
[03:47:21.766 --> 03:47:22.766]  Started screaming.
[03:47:22.766 --> 03:47:23.587]  Aggressiveness.
[03:47:23.587 --> 03:47:26.928]  Insomnia.
[03:47:26.928 --> 03:47:28.629]  Decreased REM sleep.
[03:47:28.629 --> 03:47:31.290]  On and on and on.
[03:47:31.290 --> 03:47:32.271]  Hypertension.
[03:47:32.271 --> 03:47:32.911]  Seizures.
[03:47:34.784 --> 03:47:37.905]  Convulsions.
[03:47:37.905 --> 03:48:00.070]  Everybody knows, who's familiar with amphetamine-type drugs, that if you take them for a certain length of time, after the initial wow wears off, like, boy, I've got increased clarity, this is terrific, I can study, and so on and so on, an evening out occurs, a crash occurs in many people,
[03:48:01.041 --> 03:48:02.361]  They crash.
[03:48:02.361 --> 03:48:06.622]  A speed crash is what they used to call it on the street.
[03:48:06.622 --> 03:48:11.543]  Now the person is in fantastically bad shape.
[03:48:11.543 --> 03:48:14.143]  Huddling in a corner.
[03:48:14.143 --> 03:48:19.304]  So consider a child in that situation.
[03:48:19.304 --> 03:48:21.765]  Or a college student.
[03:48:21.765 --> 03:48:22.985]  Back to the psychiatrist.
[03:48:22.985 --> 03:48:24.265]  What does the psychiatrist say?
[03:48:24.265 --> 03:48:28.166]  Well, from what you're saying here, it's obvious to me
[03:48:29.420 --> 03:48:34.943]  That you are really suffering from clinical depression now.
[03:48:34.943 --> 03:48:35.783]  Really, doctor?
[03:48:35.783 --> 03:48:37.004]  Yeah.
[03:48:37.004 --> 03:48:42.307]  Well, I mean, I'm assuming that's related to the drug that you gave me for ADHD.
[03:48:42.307 --> 03:48:43.227]  Of course not.
[03:48:43.227 --> 03:48:43.788]  No.
[03:48:43.788 --> 03:48:45.508]  Where did you get that idea?
[03:48:45.508 --> 03:48:49.351]  There couldn't be any relationship to the drug for ADHD.
[03:48:49.351 --> 03:48:55.754]  No, this is the emergence of a new condition, clinical depression.
[03:48:55.754 --> 03:48:57.655]  And so I'm going to put you on Zoloft.
[03:48:59.335 --> 03:49:02.217]  And now the circus moves into Phase 2.
[03:49:02.217 --> 03:49:08.661]  The brain-destroying, mind-destroying circus moves into Phase 2.
[03:49:08.661 --> 03:49:17.627]  Because now what we're talking about here is the person, the child, the student is in the system.
[03:49:17.627 --> 03:49:19.688]  And I'll give you a potential Phase 3.
[03:49:19.688 --> 03:49:19.928]  Ritalin,
[03:49:25.382 --> 03:49:27.523]  SSRI antidepressant.
[03:49:27.523 --> 03:49:30.884]  Up, down, up, down, back to the psychiatrist.
[03:49:30.884 --> 03:49:37.887]  Well, says the psychiatrist in his jolly frame of mind.
[03:49:37.887 --> 03:49:43.468]  What I'm now seeing actually coming out behind all of this is bipolar.
[03:49:43.468 --> 03:49:44.629]  That's what's going on here.
[03:49:47.025 --> 03:49:48.626]  The up, the down.
[03:49:48.626 --> 03:49:50.847]  What we used to call manic depression.
[03:49:50.847 --> 03:49:53.148]  You have your ups and you have your downs.
[03:49:53.148 --> 03:49:59.511]  You sure, doctor, that this is not connected to any of the drugs I've been taking because it really seems like it is.
[03:49:59.511 --> 03:50:01.632]  Listen, I'm the professional here.
[03:50:01.632 --> 03:50:05.093]  Where did you get such an idea?
[03:50:05.093 --> 03:50:09.375]  You must have been reading some crazy stuff somewhere.
[03:50:09.375 --> 03:50:15.158]  We're talking about mental disorders and the medicines used to treat them here.
[03:50:15.158 --> 03:50:15.718]  I'm the pro.
[03:50:17.788 --> 03:50:21.651]  So now we get into Valproate and we get into Depakote.
[03:50:21.651 --> 03:50:28.795]  These are much heavier drugs with much heavier potential effects.
[03:50:28.795 --> 03:50:31.337]  And the circus goes on.
[03:50:31.337 --> 03:50:43.245]  And as I read you that excerpt from Toxic Psychiatry about the student named Herberta, this could very well be the outcome.
[03:50:43.245 --> 03:50:44.686]  And if it's not the outcome,
[03:50:45.979 --> 03:50:54.284]  You've got kids at colleges going all over the place, doing all kinds of bizarre things.
[03:50:54.284 --> 03:50:54.824]  Stay with us.
[03:50:54.824 --> 03:50:56.265]  We'll be right back after the break.

[03:53:00.134 --> 03:53:11.003]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:53:11.003 --> 03:53:15.166]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[03:53:15.166 --> 03:53:17.288]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:53:17.288 --> 03:53:22.752]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:53:22.912 --> 03:53:32.919]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:53:32.919 --> 03:53:39.384]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:53:39.384 --> 03:53:42.726]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:53:42.726 --> 03:53:44.768]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:53:44.768 --> 03:53:47.870]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:53:47.930 --> 03:53:48.510]  We're good to go.
[03:54:18.884 --> 03:54:34.705]  This is a island that at its widest level is what 12 miles from shore to shore and at its smallest level or smallest
[03:54:38.095 --> 03:54:46.777]  Location, it's seven miles between one shore and the other.
[03:54:46.777 --> 03:54:49.298]  Is that correct?
[03:54:49.298 --> 03:54:55.319]  I don't have the exact dimensions, but to your point, sir, I think Guam is a small island.
[03:54:55.319 --> 03:55:05.562]  My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over
[03:55:07.322 --> 03:55:10.724]  I stand here as a free slave.
[03:55:10.724 --> 03:55:12.645]  What are we going to do?
[03:55:12.645 --> 03:55:13.786]  How can a president
[03:55:34.718 --> 03:55:47.084]  Who is acting in the manner that he's acting, whether he's talking about the travel ban, the way that he's targeting Muslims, or whether he's talking about his relationship to Putin and the Kremlin.
[03:55:47.084 --> 03:55:53.968]  And knowing that they have hacked our DCCC and DNC.
[03:55:53.968 --> 03:56:02.572]  And knowing that he is responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families.
[03:56:04.653 --> 03:56:06.795]  What is Aleppo?
[03:56:06.795 --> 03:56:08.896]  Yeah, in Aleppo.
[03:56:08.896 --> 03:56:17.221]  You are correct.
[03:56:17.221 --> 03:56:27.368]  The fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea.
[03:56:32.642 --> 03:56:36.845]  Bing, bing, bong, bong, bing, bing, bing, stop it.
[03:56:36.845 --> 03:56:38.366]  Okay.
[03:56:38.366 --> 03:56:45.352]  So I think now we need to find out how many people in Congress are on psychiatric drugs after watching that.
[03:56:45.352 --> 03:56:47.574]  I think that's the next step.
[03:56:47.574 --> 03:56:52.518]  Because, sure, not making any sense.
[03:56:52.518 --> 03:56:56.561]  We are nearing the end of this hour.
[03:56:56.561 --> 03:56:57.262]  Takeaways?
[03:56:58.902 --> 03:57:01.666]  The number one mind control program at U.S.
[03:57:01.666 --> 03:57:05.311]  colleges is psychiatry.
[03:57:05.311 --> 03:57:07.895]  25% of all college students in the U.S.
[03:57:07.895 --> 03:57:12.602]  have either been diagnosed or treated for mental disorder.
[03:57:12.602 --> 03:57:13.623]  This explains
[03:57:14.384 --> 03:57:19.306]  The microaggression thing and the triggering thing and the home thing, safe space and all of that.
[03:57:19.306 --> 03:57:25.908]  It's a combination of, I'm a victim, so I can just be victimized by anything.
[03:57:25.908 --> 03:57:26.828]  It's a new world.
[03:57:26.828 --> 03:57:30.789]  I've got a new role to play in the grand scheme.
[03:57:30.789 --> 03:57:41.353]  Or, and, it's the effects of the psychiatric drugs, scrambling brain chemistry, that make kids do and say the strangest things.
[03:57:42.529 --> 03:57:46.512]  As they're developing brain damage.
[03:57:46.512 --> 03:57:49.574]  As they're developing brain damage.
[03:57:49.574 --> 03:57:51.835]  Not kidding around here, folks.
[03:57:51.835 --> 03:57:54.297]  It's chemical warfare.
[03:57:54.297 --> 03:58:08.706]  It is sustained year by year, generation by generation now, with psychiatry holding a kind of virtual monopoly backed up by the federal government on mental health.
[03:58:08.706 --> 03:58:09.687]  That's where we're at.
[03:58:10.888 --> 03:58:15.151]  And this has to be thrown over.
[03:58:15.151 --> 03:58:16.112]  Thrown over.
[03:58:16.112 --> 03:58:16.813]  Thanks.
[03:58:16.813 --> 03:58:18.234]  John Rappaport here.
[03:58:18.234 --> 03:58:18.914]  See you next time.
