[00:00.000 --> 00:07.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's already Thursday, the 9th day of February 2017.
[00:07.040 --> 00:09.880]  Senator Sessions has been confirmed to be the Attorney General.
[00:09.880 --> 00:14.880]  The globalists are certainly scared right now, but John Bowne's got a special report
[00:14.880 --> 00:19.880]  on how they're upping the race war card to the next level.
[00:19.880 --> 00:27.280]  Former Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions will now be addressed as Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
[00:27.280 --> 00:33.160]  Last night's vote of confirmation finally tallied after the Democrats waged a marathon
[00:33.160 --> 00:38.120]  of shallow character assassinations on the integrity of Jeff Sessions' candidacy as
[00:38.120 --> 00:40.720]  the most powerful lawyer in the land.
[00:40.720 --> 00:46.880]  Senator Sessions is voting, views on voting rights, and in mind, and understanding how
[00:46.880 --> 00:55.200]  he responded to the president's claims is important to helping us assess whether he
[00:55.200 --> 01:05.920]  is capable of filling one of the Attorney General's most important duties, protecting
[01:05.920 --> 01:07.280]  the right to vote.
[01:07.280 --> 01:19.320]  I start my remarks tonight, aggrieved by what I saw happen to Elizabeth Warren.
[01:19.320 --> 01:25.320]  Of course, Senator Elizabeth Warren had been silenced as she violated protocol whilst playing
[01:25.320 --> 01:28.720]  the Democrats' Weapon of Choice, the race card.
[01:28.720 --> 01:36.400]  And the Senator played a key role in shaping what has become the most extreme, most divisive,
[01:36.400 --> 01:43.840]  and most dangerous immigration policies of any president in decades.
[01:43.840 --> 01:48.560]  Senator Sessions' radical views are not limited to immigration.
[01:48.560 --> 01:56.880]  On issue after issue after issue, Senator Sessions has displayed open hostility to the
[01:56.880 --> 01:59.560]  rights of all Americans.
[01:59.560 --> 02:05.720]  He has made derogatory and racist comments that should have no place in our justice system.
[02:05.720 --> 02:13.480]  Mr. President, the Majority Leader, the Senators impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague
[02:13.480 --> 02:17.120]  from Alabama as warned by the chair.
[02:17.120 --> 02:22.000]  Senator Warren, quote, said Senator Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.200]  chill the pre-exercise of the vote by black citizens.
[02:27.200 --> 02:31.560]  I call the Senator to order under the provisions of Rule 19.
[02:31.560 --> 02:37.920]  CNN came to her aid, claiming the Senate has silenced Elizabeth Warren, and by doing so,
[02:37.920 --> 02:43.800]  Majority Republicans just handed the liberal firebrand a megaphone, further elevating President
[02:43.800 --> 02:48.440]  Donald Trump's fiercest and most prominent critic in the Senate, and turning her into
[02:48.440 --> 02:50.320]  a democratic hero.
[02:50.320 --> 02:54.360]  When the smoke and mirrors had cleared, the truth was to be told.
[02:54.360 --> 02:58.960]  Warren had managed to play the race card so obviously in the name of civil rights leader
[02:58.960 --> 03:01.520]  Coretta Scott King.
[03:01.520 --> 03:09.080]  Senator Sessions, it's a great honor and privilege for me to join you in celebrating the grand
[03:09.080 --> 03:13.040]  opening of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum.
[03:13.040 --> 03:19.640]  MLK's niece responded, saying, if we take a look at my Aunt Coretta Scott King's letter,
[03:19.640 --> 03:22.320]  we know that she was a peacemaker.
[03:22.320 --> 03:25.800]  Her intentions were never to divide during her whole life.
[03:25.800 --> 03:31.920]  And so in that letter, she would be referring to perhaps some of his comments, however,
[03:31.920 --> 03:37.840]  she would agree today that he, of course, ended some school desegregation.
[03:37.840 --> 03:41.440]  He worked to prosecute members of the KKK.
[03:41.440 --> 03:46.120]  Aunt Coretta was a very reasonable woman, and she, with integrity, would have noted
[03:46.120 --> 03:48.480]  that he had done some great work.
[03:48.480 --> 03:52.760]  Attorney General Jeff Sessions may not have the support of the Democrats, but he does
[03:52.760 --> 03:58.080]  have the support of the voters who wish to see the swamp drained in Washington, D.C.
[03:58.080 --> 04:03.680]  A recently retired 25-year veteran of the U.S. Department of State had this to say about
[04:03.680 --> 04:09.000]  Jeff Sessions, I fully support President Donald Trump's executive order that temporarily halts
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.320]  admissions from the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and bans travel from nationals of
[04:14.320 --> 04:19.080]  countries that potentially pose a security risk to the United States.
[04:19.080 --> 04:22.200]  However, I don't think the action goes far enough.
[04:22.200 --> 04:27.200]  I have seen firsthand the abuses and fraud that permeate the refugee program and know
[04:27.200 --> 04:32.680]  about the entrenched interests that fight every effort to implement much-needed reform.
[04:32.680 --> 04:37.680]  Quoted from a letter published in the Chicago Tribune from recently retired U.S. State Department
[04:37.680 --> 04:43.800]  veteran, Mary Doach, it is time to put away childish, race-baiting tactics, liberals.
[04:43.800 --> 04:48.120]  The United States is going to get on with the business of protecting its interest in
[04:48.120 --> 04:51.120]  national security with or without you.
[04:51.120 --> 04:56.600]  Denigrating people who disagree with us, I think is not a healthy trend for our body.
[04:56.600 --> 05:02.640]  John Bound for Infowars.com.
[05:02.640 --> 05:05.400]  Radiation in Fukushima has reached unprecedented levels.
[05:05.400 --> 05:09.000]  News has been breaking for days now that radiation levels inside the damaged nuclear
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.760]  reactor are at their highest point since the meltdown in 2011.
[05:12.760 --> 05:17.800]  Tokyo Electric Power, or TEPCO, has said that readings as high as 530 seabirds an hour have
[05:17.800 --> 05:22.400]  been recorded inside of nuclear reactor number two, one of the three failing reactors, that's
[05:22.400 --> 05:23.960]  100 times the fatal level.
[05:23.960 --> 05:27.880]  This increase is quite alarming, considering the previous high was 73 seabirds an hour,
[05:27.880 --> 05:29.560]  a 700 percent increase.
[05:29.560 --> 05:33.320]  The hypothesis for the increased levels at this point is that nuclear fuel melted a hole
[05:33.320 --> 05:34.920]  through a containment vessel.
[05:34.920 --> 05:38.360]  These increased levels of radiation will make cleanup even more difficult, considering
[05:38.360 --> 05:41.960]  the most advanced robot for the assignment can only last two hours in the atmosphere
[05:41.960 --> 05:42.960]  before failing.
[05:42.960 --> 05:47.560]  Estimated cost of cleanup, if possible, is said to have doubled, but let's be honest,
[05:47.560 --> 05:49.400]  the cost of this is immeasurable.
[05:49.400 --> 05:52.960]  This meltdown has already severely crippled marine life in the Pacific Ocean.
[05:52.960 --> 05:56.080]  The protesters in the mainstream news are still silent on this issue.
[05:56.080 --> 05:58.680]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[05:58.680 --> 06:05.360]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and
[06:05.360 --> 06:06.360]  nutraceuticals.

[06:58.440 --> 07:01.880]  Check it out for yourself today.
[07:01.880 --> 07:03.240]  This is Alex Jones.
[07:03.240 --> 07:07.600]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid
[07:07.600 --> 07:08.600]  products of 2017.
[07:08.600 --> 07:11.720]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[07:11.720 --> 07:15.360]  I'm talking about the PPX Solar Generator System from our friends at Solutions from
[07:15.360 --> 07:17.640]  Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[07:17.640 --> 07:21.800]  The PPX is so small, you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful, you can run some
[07:21.800 --> 07:26.640]  110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[07:26.640 --> 07:31.080]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment,
[07:31.080 --> 07:32.080]  even airplanes.
[07:32.080 --> 07:36.320]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own
[07:36.320 --> 07:39.280]  private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[07:39.280 --> 07:44.160]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a while.
[07:44.160 --> 07:47.520]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[07:47.520 --> 07:49.600]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[07:49.600 --> 07:55.360]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout, and get a second PPX Energy Unit for free.
[07:55.360 --> 07:57.760]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[07:57.760 --> 07:58.760]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[07:58.760 --> 08:06.760]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[08:06.760 --> 08:07.760]  You think?
[08:07.760 --> 08:08.760]  Just let me think.
[08:08.760 --> 08:09.760]  I'm sick.
[08:09.760 --> 08:13.760]  Even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[08:13.760 --> 08:14.760]  It's Chancellor Sutlow.
[08:14.760 --> 08:15.760]  Damn it.
[08:15.760 --> 08:16.760]  Why?
[08:16.760 --> 08:21.920]  Because while the truncheon may be used at lieu of conversation, words will always retain
[08:21.920 --> 08:22.920]  their power.
[08:22.920 --> 08:28.400]  Words are for the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of
[08:28.400 --> 08:29.400]  truth.
[08:29.400 --> 08:34.120]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[08:34.120 --> 08:35.120]  You decided, sir.
[08:35.120 --> 08:36.120]  You wanted it for a proof.
[08:36.120 --> 08:37.760]  You told me every television in London.
[08:37.760 --> 08:41.640]  Cruelty, and injustices, intolerance, and depression.
[08:41.640 --> 08:45.960]  And where once you have the freedom to object to something, and speak as you saw fit, you
[08:45.960 --> 08:50.880]  now have sensors and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity, and selecting your
[08:50.880 --> 08:51.880]  submachine.
[08:51.880 --> 08:52.880]  We need cameras.
[08:52.880 --> 08:53.880]  How did this happen?
[08:53.880 --> 08:54.880]  Who's to blame?
[08:54.880 --> 08:58.680]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[08:58.680 --> 09:04.360]  They will be held accountable, but again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty,
[09:04.360 --> 09:07.240]  you need only look into a mirror.
[09:07.240 --> 09:09.240]  I know why you did it.
[09:09.240 --> 09:10.240]  I know you were afraid.
[09:10.240 --> 09:11.240]  Who would be?
[09:11.240 --> 09:12.240]  War, terror, disease?
[09:12.240 --> 09:19.640]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason, and rob you of your
[09:19.640 --> 09:20.640]  common sense.
[09:20.640 --> 09:26.040]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic, you turned to the now high Chancellor, Adam
[09:26.040 --> 09:27.040]  Sutler.
[09:27.040 --> 09:32.360]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent
[09:32.360 --> 09:43.360]  obedient consent.
[09:43.360 --> 09:47.040]  There is a war, it's happening now, it will decide the fate of humanity, the time to choose
[09:47.040 --> 09:54.000]  sides has come, we are the resistance, we are the info war.
[09:54.000 --> 10:00.440]  And here we are on this live Thursday, the 9th of February 2017, going to be broadcasting
[10:00.440 --> 10:02.720]  worldwide here for the next four hours.
[10:02.720 --> 10:05.680]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[10:05.680 --> 10:11.240]  I have been made aware of quite a bit of information concerning White House intrigue that's going
[10:11.240 --> 10:21.080]  on in the last few months, even before President Trump actually got sworn in, 18, 19 days ago.
[10:21.080 --> 10:26.520]  And since then, I have confirmed it with several other sources.
[10:26.520 --> 10:34.520]  And time and time again, I sit on news and information I'm given, because I've been told
[10:34.520 --> 10:42.200]  my sources don't go with it yet, but also because, well, it'll quote, hurt me.
[10:42.200 --> 10:46.240]  Well, I don't care what happens to Alex Jones at the end of the day when it comes down to
[10:46.240 --> 10:50.720]  this Republic and the future of this country.
[10:50.720 --> 10:55.680]  I'll just tell you this, and I'm going to have to break this soon because it's too dangerous,
[10:55.680 --> 11:00.360]  too dangerous to have this information and not go with it, but I'm kind of making the
[11:00.360 --> 11:02.600]  decision right now.
[11:02.600 --> 11:15.800]  There's a lot of evidence pointing towards leakers, and it's just amazing, not just democratic
[11:15.800 --> 11:21.440]  or globalist leakers inside the Pentagon, inside the CIA, but people even closer to
[11:21.440 --> 11:29.680]  President Trump leaking information and leaking the target list so that Al Qaeda knew that
[11:29.680 --> 11:36.520]  that raid was coming a week and a half ago, so that they could be waiting and cause larger
[11:36.520 --> 11:42.440]  casualties just like the CIA reportedly leaked information to Fidel Castro during the raid
[11:42.440 --> 11:51.880]  to begin the failed invasion known as the Bay of Pigs in the early 1960s.
[11:51.880 --> 11:55.680]  So there's definitely a lot of dirty tricks going on to undermine this Republic.
[11:55.680 --> 12:06.440]  I put some feelers out to military sources, folks in D.C., folks in Southern California,
[12:06.440 --> 12:13.600]  and folks that are in Africa right now, and they just said that definitely folks were
[12:13.600 --> 12:21.400]  waiting, so it was just basically a setup, and that's just part of it.
[12:21.400 --> 12:27.120]  Now, if you know what incredible backstabbers the Republican Party leadership was against
[12:27.120 --> 12:32.160]  Trump and how they were funded, the top six Republicans by George Soros is one of their
[12:32.160 --> 12:33.160]  biggest contributors.
[12:33.160 --> 12:37.080]  And if you realize that the leaks are just spilling out from the very top of the White
[12:37.080 --> 12:43.520]  House, they're not coming from Jess Sessions, they're not coming from Rex Tillerson, it's
[12:43.520 --> 12:50.520]  not coming from Stephen Bannon.
[12:50.520 --> 12:56.480]  And very soon, I'm gonna be able to give you more details, but some people in that administration
[12:56.480 --> 13:05.400]  are not long for this world, and I don't mean physically, I mean politically.
[13:05.400 --> 13:12.480]  But you think about the type of trash that's Paul Ryan, the type of trash that is Lindsey
[13:12.480 --> 13:22.440]  Graham, the type of trash that is John McCain, and their cohort, Mitch McConnell, truly disgusting,
[13:22.440 --> 13:24.160]  truly disgusting.
[13:24.160 --> 13:30.680]  Well, Senator Sessions is now, Attorney General Sessions, a very honorable man, got the daughter
[13:30.680 --> 13:34.360]  of Martin Luther King coming out and endorsing him, so much more happening.
[13:34.360 --> 13:40.600]  The MSN is going into race-baiting overdrive, it is simply incredible, but you've got other
[13:40.600 --> 13:44.760]  good news, Americans find Trump more trustworthy than the media in major poll, Paul Joseph
[13:44.760 --> 13:47.720]  Watson in FullWars.com story.
[13:47.720 --> 13:53.040]  Trump releases a list of two dozen terrorists suspects allowed to enter the United States
[13:53.040 --> 13:56.840]  from behind banned countries.
[13:56.840 --> 14:02.040]  The counterman, the lie of one of the judges that's out there attacking Trump, then when
[14:02.040 --> 14:10.160]  Trump responds back, even his new attorney, even his new Supreme Court nominee doesn't
[14:10.160 --> 14:13.320]  back the president and says, well, he doesn't like it when the judiciary is attacked.
[14:13.320 --> 14:16.800]  Well, the judiciary is not supposed to be political, running around trying to undermine
[14:16.800 --> 14:17.800]  the country.
[14:17.800 --> 14:23.760]  So there's a lot coming up on that front today.
[14:23.760 --> 14:30.400]  Sessions' confirmation, error of mass amnesty policies is over, says pro-American immigration
[14:30.400 --> 14:32.560]  reform.
[14:32.560 --> 14:37.120]  Sessions is unparalleled in his knowledge of the proper role of the Department of Justice,
[14:37.120 --> 14:42.960]  the legislative process, and the rule of law.
[14:42.960 --> 14:50.040]  Little crystal has come out, his father was the head Trotskyite out of Mexico, first out
[14:50.040 --> 14:55.760]  of Russia, then the head Trotskyite that's basically been running the Republican Party
[14:55.760 --> 14:58.320]  for at least 40 years.
[14:58.320 --> 15:04.520]  That's right, Leon Trotsky ran out of Stalinist Russia, came to Mexico, got killed with an
[15:04.520 --> 15:14.760]  ice axe in Mexico City, the rest of them fled up here, took over Chicago Business School.
[15:14.760 --> 15:16.360]  I mean, how could you make that up?
[15:16.360 --> 15:17.360]  You can't make that up.
[15:17.360 --> 15:18.360]  That's mainline history.
[15:18.360 --> 15:21.920]  That's Wall Street Journal, New York Times, folks.
[15:21.920 --> 15:29.960]  And now are saying that white working classes should be replaced by immigrants and that
[15:29.960 --> 15:32.200]  whites are inherently lazy and stupid and bad.
[15:32.200 --> 15:36.240]  Well, no, you can say third, fourth, fifth generation Americans, whether they're Hispanic,
[15:36.240 --> 15:40.600]  black or white, tend to be more lazy because we've grown up in a land of milk and honey.
[15:40.600 --> 15:45.520]  I'm lazier than my dad was, my kids are probably a little bit more lazy than I was.
[15:45.520 --> 15:49.120]  I mean, it's just the nature of the TV, the culture, everybody knows that.
[15:49.120 --> 15:53.280]  It's not because they're white, imagine if you said the black people need to be replaced
[15:53.280 --> 15:54.280]  because they're lazy.
[15:54.280 --> 15:55.280]  What?
[15:55.280 --> 16:03.600]  This is the most hardcore, classic racism, the 200 proof stuff, 110% stuff, all the
[16:03.600 --> 16:06.240]  way over the top stuff.
[16:06.240 --> 16:10.400]  But if you look at the world and you look at 7% of the world being white, that's what
[16:10.400 --> 16:16.360]  a lot of folks identifying for being white who really aren't, classically.
[16:16.360 --> 16:20.520]  And so the globals look at the numbers and people are people.
[16:20.520 --> 16:24.720]  You can teach a black person, Hispanic person, Asian to be totally racist.
[16:24.720 --> 16:27.240]  Like China's super racist, that's well known.
[16:27.240 --> 16:36.240]  Or just xenophobic, insular, homogenous, not homogenous.
[16:36.240 --> 16:40.080]  The point is that that's the strategy.
[16:40.080 --> 16:44.960]  The globalists are going to flood the last one third world populations and train them
[16:44.960 --> 16:49.800]  to be basically the equivalent of brown Nazis, but anti-white.
[16:49.800 --> 16:55.040]  It's a total reversal, you study British intelligence and others putting Hitler in power and that
[16:55.040 --> 16:56.040]  whole plan.
[16:56.040 --> 16:59.240]  It's just the same thing using race to control people over and over again.
[16:59.240 --> 17:00.400]  It's just so incredible.
[17:00.400 --> 17:05.520]  And you're seeing desperate attempts now to try to fuse everybody together in a melting
[17:05.520 --> 17:09.040]  pot, a common culture by Trump and good people in our government.
[17:09.040 --> 17:12.080]  That's why I've suddenly gone from opposing the government to supporting it because it's
[17:12.080 --> 17:16.320]  suddenly trying to have a good aim, a constitutional direction.
[17:16.320 --> 17:17.320]  It's clear as day.
[17:17.320 --> 17:20.600]  The whole global government's against Trump.
[17:20.600 --> 17:26.600]  And remember Sally Brown running for the DNC, top Democrat saying, I will oppress the whites,
[17:26.600 --> 17:30.480]  I'll keep them down, I'll make sure you get the privilege and they don't.
[17:30.480 --> 17:31.480]  What?
[17:31.480 --> 17:32.480]  Like you get some privilege.
[17:32.480 --> 17:37.440]  Let me tell you something, you go to a country club and you're not from around, they don't
[17:37.440 --> 17:41.680]  care if you're white or brown or who you are, they're not going to like you.
[17:41.680 --> 17:44.680]  But you go to most of the country clubs and you're some elite golfer, I don't care what
[17:44.680 --> 17:45.680]  color you are.
[17:45.680 --> 17:49.760]  You'll be worshiping at your feet.
[17:49.760 --> 17:52.680]  But again, they just hype this and hype this like it's the only thing in the world, everybody
[17:52.680 --> 17:53.960]  has chips on their shoulders.
[17:53.960 --> 17:59.320]  And then you go to college to become a mental patient and just be totally upset in the basket
[17:59.320 --> 18:00.320]  case.
[18:00.320 --> 18:04.240]  There's a powerful article on infowars.com by John Rappaport, the number one mind control
[18:04.240 --> 18:08.200]  program at U.S. colleges, the unspoken secret in plain sight.
[18:08.200 --> 18:11.480]  If you're a college student or have a child in college, read this.
[18:11.480 --> 18:16.000]  It's a 12 page incredible report that is dead on.
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.920]  He's hosting the fourth hour today and I hope he's covering that.
[18:18.920 --> 18:22.440]  I don't tell folks really what to cover when they guest host because that's that's that's
[18:22.440 --> 18:26.760]  that's respect to my one to be able to host an hour or so a week of the fourth hour.
[18:26.760 --> 18:32.120]  But I mean, I hope Rappaport's covering this in detail today because it is super important.
[18:32.120 --> 18:33.200]  I'm not against college.
[18:33.200 --> 18:36.000]  I'm against what it's been hijacked and turned into.
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.240]  I'm not against vaccines.
[18:37.240 --> 18:41.720]  I'm against them being used as Trojan horse piggyback programs and secret projects that
[18:41.720 --> 18:45.480]  have been declassified.
[18:45.480 --> 18:47.960]  It's the same story.
[18:47.960 --> 18:52.200]  Not against smartphones, except they got a bunch of backdoor Trojan horse garbage.
[18:52.200 --> 18:53.720]  It's the same deal.
[18:53.720 --> 18:59.520]  I'm going to skip this break so I have more time.
[18:59.520 --> 19:06.880]  So white working class be replaced by immigrants and then you've got Nancy Pelosi and Maxine
[19:06.880 --> 19:10.680]  Waters and a press conference in the same press conference thinking Bush is still in
[19:10.680 --> 19:14.120]  office after he's out of office eight years and change.
[19:14.120 --> 19:17.080]  You've got.
[19:17.080 --> 19:21.880]  Waters thinking that Putin invaded Korea doesn't even say north or south.
[19:21.880 --> 19:25.360]  I mean, it's just total cuckoo land.
[19:25.360 --> 19:27.160]  And that's who's running things.
[19:27.160 --> 19:31.320]  People that think islands are floating that put a sale on them.
[19:31.320 --> 19:34.040]  You know, you hear Hawaii crash into California last year.
[19:34.040 --> 19:35.680]  It was floating around out there.
[19:35.680 --> 19:36.680]  It's not floating.
[19:36.680 --> 19:44.040]  It's an it's an underwater mountain with the tip sticking out.
[19:44.040 --> 19:47.800]  I can't believe you have to explain this to people, but but he said, oh, well, that's
[19:47.800 --> 19:49.400]  just some idiot on the street.
[19:49.400 --> 19:51.280]  You know, Mark dies goes and finds morons.
[19:51.280 --> 19:52.280]  No, he doesn't.
[19:52.280 --> 19:57.720]  He'll go interview 20 people and 19 of them say put gun owners in forced labor camps.
[19:57.720 --> 20:00.000]  That's who those Californians are.
[20:00.000 --> 20:01.000]  We do it in Austin.
[20:01.000 --> 20:03.440]  It's nine out of 10.
[20:03.440 --> 20:08.280]  People frighteningly dumb, frighteningly evil, frighteningly authoritarian.
[20:08.280 --> 20:13.000]  They're ready to do whatever if the state says do it because that's how they're in.
[20:13.000 --> 20:14.000]  That's how they're trendies.
[20:14.000 --> 20:22.200]  They've submitted their will over to the system is how to destroy him.
[20:22.200 --> 20:25.480]  He goes out and says, let's have reparations where all whites pay up white privilege tax
[20:25.480 --> 20:32.840]  and white people, black people, you name it, go, you bet, we're all for it.
[20:32.840 --> 20:34.120]  These aren't just dumb people on the street.
[20:34.120 --> 20:35.920]  This is Nancy Pelosi.
[20:35.920 --> 20:38.960]  This is Maxine waters in the same five minutes.
[20:38.960 --> 20:40.720]  They don't know what planet they're on.
[20:40.720 --> 20:42.360]  I was watching other press conferences of theirs.
[20:42.360 --> 20:47.400]  I went back last night for about an hour and they're just what's this to the microphone
[20:47.400 --> 20:50.640]  and just they don't know what they're doing.
[20:50.640 --> 20:57.840]  They can't find their big fat rarians with both of their criminal pause, but they've
[20:57.840 --> 21:04.200]  been put there because they're ready to do absolutely unpopular criminal things in my
[21:04.200 --> 21:05.200]  view.
[21:05.200 --> 21:08.200]  So let's hear from Bill Crestle.
[21:08.200 --> 21:09.840]  I mean an arrogant.
[21:09.840 --> 21:15.960]  He just sits there with total arrogance with his chin up in the sky like he's a God.
[21:15.960 --> 21:18.120]  And he just is his shoulders drooping.
[21:18.120 --> 21:24.440]  Just the body language is just complete mental illness, complete megalomania.
[21:24.440 --> 21:25.440]  But you know what?
[21:25.440 --> 21:26.440]  He should be megalomania.
[21:26.440 --> 21:31.120]  His family came here after running from Stalin and took over the Republican Party and has
[21:31.120 --> 21:34.240]  gutted the entire nation and almost wrecked it.
[21:34.240 --> 21:38.240]  So just it's good to screw America over.
[21:38.240 --> 21:42.280]  It's good to be a big fat parasite.
[21:42.280 --> 21:46.120]  And so he works with the Democrats to screw America over.
[21:46.120 --> 21:51.520]  He works with Paul Ryan, all the other Soros minions, and he thinks you're stupid.
[21:51.520 --> 21:56.360]  He thinks you're an idiot and he says the problem is the white working class should
[21:56.360 --> 21:58.560]  be replaced.
[21:58.560 --> 22:02.120]  People figure this out yet, but let me give all the minorities a little newsflash.
[22:02.120 --> 22:03.240]  You're the majority.
[22:03.240 --> 22:06.240]  If you bring down America, you burn up your own life raft.
[22:06.240 --> 22:08.200]  You blow up your own birthright.
[22:08.200 --> 22:10.840]  You're complete idiots if you do that.
[22:10.840 --> 22:14.640]  People are like, oh really, you're going to get it now, Whitey.
[22:14.640 --> 22:15.920]  I'm like, nothing's going to happen to me.
[22:15.920 --> 22:17.120]  Let me explain what's going to happen.
[22:17.120 --> 22:19.560]  You're going to be used to drive down all the wages.
[22:19.560 --> 22:22.840]  You're going to live in a big police state and then you're going to be totally exploited
[22:22.840 --> 22:27.280]  to make sure there's no ladder out of this for anybody.
[22:27.280 --> 22:32.480]  And people like Crystal is going to sit there and laugh at all of us like we're stupid.
[22:32.480 --> 22:36.520]  Just like Gruber said, thank God the Americans are so dumb and don't pay attention and have
[22:36.520 --> 22:39.400]  no attention spans because we're going to double and triple their prices.
[22:39.400 --> 22:44.860]  And he's up there on C-SPAN with a bunch of other professors and statisticians giggling
[22:44.860 --> 22:46.760]  and smirking and laughing.
[22:46.760 --> 22:53.640]  It's like a ruling class of uncool, jerk nerd slash serial killer types.
[22:53.640 --> 22:58.240]  Most serial killers don't look like a pocket protector nerd and they're just out to get
[22:58.240 --> 22:59.240]  everybody.
[22:59.240 --> 23:02.920]  They're hyper-aggressive, they want to be dominant, and they've been given an open free
[23:02.920 --> 23:05.800]  society and they take that as an excuse.
[23:05.800 --> 23:12.280]  They take our kindness as real alpha males as weakness and they run completely and out
[23:12.280 --> 23:15.480]  of control with it.
[23:15.480 --> 23:20.600]  And they tell you you're stupid and they'll get a bunch of beta-compliant women and hype
[23:20.600 --> 23:26.160]  them all up to run around hen-pecking everywhere in an aggressive display to bring down the
[23:26.160 --> 23:28.680]  civilization.
[23:28.680 --> 23:31.960]  It's crazy.
[23:31.960 --> 23:34.640]  But you can see the plan, you can see the numbers.
[23:34.640 --> 23:40.000]  Open the borders, bring in unlimited third-world populations, they can out-vote, out-riot, out-drive
[23:40.000 --> 23:45.200]  down wages, anybody, and then it's boom, vulcanized society, you've broken the free society,
[23:45.200 --> 23:46.200]  it's over.
[23:46.200 --> 23:50.760]  I'm going to get to that clip in a moment, but meanwhile, how beautiful is this?
[23:50.760 --> 23:58.040]  Matt Drudge fires up the bat beam last night, for more ever, he said, up into the night
[23:58.040 --> 24:02.640]  sky to Trump and says the Republican Party ought to be sued for fraud.
[24:02.640 --> 24:03.640]  It's a joke.
[24:03.640 --> 24:06.080]  I want to see tax cuts right now.
[24:06.080 --> 24:07.080]  Trump promised it.
[24:07.080 --> 24:11.640]  I don't want to see, you know, sanctions on countries that are getting rare earth minerals
[24:11.640 --> 24:12.640]  or whatever.
[24:12.640 --> 24:14.200]  I don't want to see a bunch of UN-style stuff.
[24:14.200 --> 24:17.480]  I want to see action, and I want to see it now.
[24:17.480 --> 24:20.040]  But what happened a couple hours later?
[24:20.040 --> 24:25.200]  Well, Batman saw it, because what do you think Drudge is doing at night?
[24:25.200 --> 24:27.880]  He's reading Drudge, he's reading info wars, he's watching our videos.
[24:27.880 --> 24:30.880]  I'll just tell you that point blank, right for the man himself.
[24:30.880 --> 24:37.440]  Trump to Drudge, phenomenal tax cut package, coming in two to three weeks.
[24:37.440 --> 24:48.560]  Now, in fairness to Trump, I'm not disagreeing with Drudge, saying that they're going to
[24:48.560 --> 24:51.560]  cut two-thirds of the regulations and signing an executive order is the same thing as a
[24:51.560 --> 24:52.560]  tax cut.
[24:52.560 --> 24:56.120]  I mean, it is, because it's just the money gets passed on to the employees, the owners,
[24:56.120 --> 25:01.360]  it creates productivity, hiring, but in a purest sense, the Republican leadership is
[25:01.360 --> 25:06.840]  trying to send it to 2018 after they quote, get rid of Obamacare, after they quote, you
[25:06.840 --> 25:07.840]  know, get rid of this stuff.
[25:07.840 --> 25:08.840]  Then they're going to do it.
[25:08.840 --> 25:09.840]  That's what they always do.
[25:09.840 --> 25:11.960]  They always move the can down the road.
[25:11.960 --> 25:13.240]  They're trying to give Trump cover.
[25:13.240 --> 25:14.240]  He doesn't want cover.
[25:14.240 --> 25:19.040]  It's like Genners before he got kicked out of the, you know, entourage, said, oh, we're
[25:19.040 --> 25:22.160]  not going to drag the swamp, don't worry, I've talked to Trump.
[25:22.160 --> 25:23.560]  Trump said, go out and publicly apologize.
[25:23.560 --> 25:27.880]  But you never really heard from Genners again, did you, speaking for Trump?
[25:27.880 --> 25:32.440]  They're there trying to undermine his base while they pretend that they're their friends.
[25:32.440 --> 25:42.600]  How beautiful is that to see within 12 hours, puts out the tweets in the afternoon, hits
[25:42.600 --> 25:49.520]  the news at night, Trump goes and reads it, you retweeted it, Trump, you are communicating
[25:49.520 --> 25:54.240]  the American people through Drudge directly with the president of the United States.
[25:54.240 --> 25:58.820]  He who is directly listening to you for like three, four hours a night, reading stacks
[25:58.820 --> 26:04.000]  of mail and he has computers and Trump, more and more is getting on computers himself.
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.120]  He's learning to cut off the people that quote, bring him what they want him to see.
[26:09.120 --> 26:14.080]  So he's in there in his office at night with computers all around him himself, getting
[26:14.080 --> 26:19.080]  in there, investigating, looking and they can phone calls.
[26:19.080 --> 26:25.440]  Then about two o'clock in the morning, he goes to sleep, he gets up at about six 30.
[26:25.440 --> 26:33.000]  His Republican Party should be sued for fraud.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.520]  They only know how to be opposition, not lead within hours.
[26:36.520 --> 26:40.840]  Trump to Drudge, phenomenal tax cut package coming in two or three weeks.
[26:40.840 --> 26:44.520]  We're going to be announcing something I would say over the next two or three weeks that
[26:44.520 --> 26:45.520]  will be phenomenal.
[26:45.520 --> 26:52.240]  President Trump to his conservative critics, I read you loud and clear.
[26:52.240 --> 26:55.160]  Last time I talked to Trump, I'm not going to get into it, but he said, you watch.
[26:55.160 --> 27:00.800]  I'm going to massively bring Congress a huge tax cut for across the board, Alex.
[27:00.800 --> 27:03.280]  I will not let you down.
[27:03.280 --> 27:04.280]  Watch.
[27:04.280 --> 27:11.520]  Now, let me talk to your wife.
[27:11.520 --> 27:15.160]  The point is, I mean, that's a joke folks.
[27:15.160 --> 27:24.960]  The point is, is that this is a crazy, crazy, crazy world and the establishment wants
[27:24.960 --> 27:32.200]  full control of everything you do, not just the power structure and Trump doesn't want
[27:32.200 --> 27:34.160]  to be a control freak running your life.
[27:34.160 --> 27:42.680]  He wants to turn you loose, set you free and he wants to preside over that.
[27:42.680 --> 27:46.680]  The bad news is Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, all of them are openly trying to drive down
[27:46.680 --> 27:50.160]  the market, trying to tell everybody to dump their stocks, trying to kill the recovery
[27:50.160 --> 27:54.440]  that never came that they promised nine years ago.
[27:54.440 --> 27:58.160]  And they're putting down articles every day, signs of a recession, there should be a recession,
[27:58.160 --> 28:00.520]  we're seeing signs of it, it could be a depression.
[28:00.520 --> 28:05.880]  Now MSN that never pushes doom and gloom, they're pushing doom and gloom right now.
[28:05.880 --> 28:07.800]  Let's go out to break with Bill Crystal.
[28:07.800 --> 28:10.200]  White working class should be replaced by immigrants.
[28:10.200 --> 28:14.720]  I look to be totally honest, if things are so bad, as you say, with the white working
[28:14.720 --> 28:20.720]  class, don't you want to get new Americans in who aren't going to be, I'm serious.
[28:20.720 --> 28:23.960]  You can make a case that I'm, this is going on too long and this is too crazy probably
[28:23.960 --> 28:28.600]  and I hope this thing isn't being like, you know, videotaped, you're ever shown anywhere.
[28:28.600 --> 28:32.960]  My whatever tiny pathetic future I have is going to be totally collected.
[28:32.960 --> 28:37.160]  You can make a case that America has become, has been great because every, every, I think
[28:37.160 --> 28:39.200]  John Adams said this at the beginning, right?
[28:39.200 --> 28:43.240]  Basically if you're in a free society, a capitalist society, after two, three, four generations
[28:43.240 --> 28:47.740]  of hard work, everyone becomes kind of decadent, lazy, spoiled, whatever.
[28:47.740 --> 28:51.800]  And then you luckily, you have these waves of people coming in from Italy and Ireland
[28:51.800 --> 28:57.000]  and Russia and now Mexico who really want to work hard and really want to succeed and
[28:57.000 --> 29:01.080]  really want their kids to live better lives than them and aren't so living coupon.
[29:01.080 --> 29:04.640]  So what he says is fundamentally true, but then let's get rid of the white people.
[29:04.640 --> 29:08.040]  Oh, and waves from Russia like you.
[29:08.040 --> 29:13.040]  And the point is that he's making it about white people.
[29:13.040 --> 29:15.880]  And the issue is that's not even statistically overall true.
[29:15.880 --> 29:16.880]  It's true.
[29:16.880 --> 29:19.520]  You do get some decadence in every strata of society.
[29:19.520 --> 29:25.480]  White people, you know, basically spoil their kids, but to just advertise the fact that unlimited
[29:25.480 --> 29:29.480]  giant migrant waves coming to the country is a good thing or the fact they're being turned
[29:29.480 --> 29:30.480]  into political weapons.
[29:30.480 --> 29:32.480]  Well, that's just untenable.
[29:32.480 --> 29:37.400]  And again, that's what you've done, Mr. Crystal, with the Democratic Party working together
[29:37.400 --> 29:41.560]  to bring us under globalism is you brought in groups of people and then brainwashed them
[29:41.560 --> 29:42.800]  against the country.
[29:42.800 --> 29:45.000]  And that's called treason.
[29:45.000 --> 29:51.000]  You dirty little Trotskyite piece of filth.
[29:51.000 --> 29:52.280]  We're on the march.
[29:52.280 --> 29:54.640]  The empire's on the run.
[29:54.640 --> 30:23.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:23.960 --> 30:28.400]  In the history of M4's life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival
[30:28.400 --> 30:33.440]  Shield X2, SuperMail Vitality and so many others with its unique delivery system and
[30:33.440 --> 30:37.640]  proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[30:37.640 --> 30:44.040]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products, and this part is most important.
[30:44.040 --> 30:49.280]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest
[30:49.280 --> 30:50.960]  quality lab standard.
[30:50.960 --> 30:52.360]  That means it's clean.
[30:52.360 --> 30:53.440]  That means it's pure.
[30:53.440 --> 30:57.640]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the InfoWars, that's infowarslife.com
[30:57.640 --> 30:59.240]  and vitamin mineral fusion.
[30:59.240 --> 31:02.440]  Take action now before we sell out.
[31:02.440 --> 31:04.080]  Hi there, Dick Holgeier here.
[31:04.080 --> 31:08.320]  I was a mainstream television news reporter for over three decades.
[31:08.320 --> 31:11.960]  I normally never do commercial endorsements.
[31:11.960 --> 31:17.360]  I am very skeptical of health supplements, but a friend of mine told me about his experience
[31:17.360 --> 31:22.360]  with Synergy One, so I purchased a bottle and my wife and I have been using it for a
[31:22.360 --> 31:23.440]  few weeks now.
[31:23.440 --> 31:29.080]  I very much dislike so-called energy boosters, those little energy drinks that have caffeine
[31:29.080 --> 31:32.440]  and Guarana and other things that make your heart race.
[31:32.440 --> 31:33.440]  This is not that.
[31:33.440 --> 31:36.720]  My experience with Synergy One has been great.
[31:36.720 --> 31:42.800]  My mood is better, my joints feel better, I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased
[31:42.800 --> 31:43.920]  productivity.
[31:43.920 --> 31:49.560]  My wife and I both noticed that we even dream more, so I recommend Synergy One.
[31:49.560 --> 32:14.560]  It's really good stuff, I'm having great results with it.
[32:14.560 --> 32:40.560]  Thank you so much for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
[32:40.560 --> 32:44.800]  Until then, soap company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned
[32:44.800 --> 32:50.120]  real soaps that are triple concentrated, soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils.
[32:50.120 --> 32:56.760]  See their full selection of soaps at 5starsoap.com, that's F-I-V-E star soap dot com, or call
[32:56.760 --> 33:23.520]  1-800-340-7091 for a catalog.
[33:23.520 --> 33:38.840]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:38.840 --> 33:40.840]  Who is the dumbest Democrat in the world?
[33:40.840 --> 33:43.080]  I want to start a contest.
[33:43.080 --> 33:45.160]  What are we going to do?
[33:45.160 --> 33:51.880]  How can a president who is acting in the manner that he's acting, whether he's talking about
[33:51.880 --> 33:58.440]  the travel ban, the way he's targeting Muslims, or whether he's talking about his relationship
[33:58.440 --> 34:08.680]  to Putin and the Kremlin, and knowing that they have hacked our DCCC and DNC, and knowing
[34:08.680 --> 34:16.120]  that he is responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families
[34:16.120 --> 34:19.120]  in Aleppo.
[34:19.120 --> 34:23.120]  What is Aleppo?
[34:23.120 --> 34:25.120]  Yeah, in Aleppo.
[34:25.120 --> 34:28.120]  You are correct.
[34:28.120 --> 34:39.360]  The fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin, while Putin is continuing to advance
[34:39.360 --> 34:48.440]  into Korea, stop it, stop it.
[34:48.440 --> 34:49.440]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:49.440 --> 34:53.720]  We're going to make a new one of those from the same press conference with Nancy Pelosi,
[34:53.720 --> 34:58.840]  believing George W. Bush was still in office, and was working with the Russians.
[34:58.840 --> 35:01.240]  I guess everybody's working with the Russians.
[35:01.240 --> 35:05.920]  No one can think of draining the swamp, or lock her up, or Hillary for president, or
[35:05.920 --> 35:07.920]  crooked Hillary without Vladimir Putin.
[35:07.920 --> 35:11.520]  In fact, I couldn't even name my children without Vladimir Putin's help.
[35:11.520 --> 35:17.040]  In fact, he called up when each child was born, and I said, Mr. President, what do I
[35:17.040 --> 35:19.480]  name my son and my daughters?
[35:19.480 --> 35:20.600]  And he would always tell me.
[35:20.600 --> 35:22.080]  So thank God he's there.
[35:22.080 --> 35:27.120]  In fact, the making of a president 2016, now a best-seller, best political seller right
[35:27.120 --> 35:30.600]  now on Amazon.com, going up the charts, now officially out, we're shipping them out every
[35:30.600 --> 35:31.600]  day.
[35:31.600 --> 35:32.600]  I'm signing them.
[35:32.600 --> 35:33.600]  Roger Stone's signing them.
[35:33.600 --> 35:34.600]  I'm going to have to stop soon, though.
[35:34.600 --> 35:38.920]  Roger says he'll go up to 15,000, well, 5,000 more or so, we're going to be there.
[35:38.920 --> 35:45.680]  The making of the president 2016, how Donald Trump orchestrated a revolution.
[35:45.680 --> 35:53.720]  Full book, infowarsstore.com, or call toll-free, AAA-253-3139, I'll tell you what's really
[35:53.720 --> 36:01.920]  selling good for $9.95, and that is the revolutionary new exclusive super-blue toothpaste made right
[36:01.920 --> 36:08.480]  here in America at the factory that makes the leading brand of fluoride free.
[36:08.480 --> 36:12.800]  That's what the formula is, when you're private label, you can't say the name, but everybody
[36:12.800 --> 36:16.400]  knows the name, and it's high-quality, it's what I personally used previously, and now
[36:16.400 --> 36:21.640]  they add our iodine, our true iodine, Deep Earth crystal iodine, and nano-colloidal
[36:21.640 --> 36:24.360]  silver along with peppermint and tea tree oil.
[36:24.360 --> 36:28.440]  We have a bubblegum flavor coming out, because yeah, it's pretty strong, and so kids don't
[36:28.440 --> 36:30.640]  really like this, but you can get them to do it.
[36:30.640 --> 36:34.240]  I mean, it tastes bad to me, but you know, as an adult, your taste buds get a different
[36:34.240 --> 36:39.640]  palate shot of Jack Daniels, tastes wonderful back when you were 14, it burned like hell,
[36:39.640 --> 36:42.720]  going under the throat, not that I'm a big drinking man, but you know what I mean?
[36:42.720 --> 36:44.120]  The allegory certainly works.
[36:44.120 --> 36:53.560]  This is the creme d'ala creme designed by my dad, InfoWarsStore.com, or triple-8253-3139,
[36:53.560 --> 36:55.680]  and I can't believe it.
[36:55.680 --> 37:00.280]  We ordered more than double what we got in the first run that sold out in one week, and
[37:00.280 --> 37:04.520]  it looks like at current sales rates, which is great, because it'll help us with the operation,
[37:04.520 --> 37:09.920]  we'll be sold out in two weeks of this, and then hopefully more will come in, but against
[37:09.920 --> 37:14.120]  that gamble to make so much of it and spend all our capital, but then it looks like folks
[37:14.120 --> 37:20.840]  love it, it's got a 4.8-star reviews, 79 reviews on power reviews, in fact, I really should
[37:20.840 --> 37:24.160]  read a few of these that go to Roger Stone.
[37:24.160 --> 37:27.280]  This is from Tiedem-Sue, Norman, Oklahoma.
[37:27.280 --> 37:32.080]  This is so different, the regular toothpaste, there is no comparison, it seems pricey, well,
[37:32.080 --> 37:36.800]  $9.95, I mean, it costs us like four or five bucks to make it, it seems pricey, but really
[37:36.800 --> 37:41.360]  isn't because you've only dispensed as a small amount at a time, exactly, it's concentrated
[37:41.360 --> 37:46.920]  folks, it not only keeps my mouth super clean and feeling healthy, it does, doesn't glob
[37:46.920 --> 37:52.000]  up on the toothbrush, rinses so cleanly, I'll never return to the old toxic toothpaste again,
[37:52.000 --> 37:57.120]  thanks to Alex and his father for this wonderful product, only one of many, well, thank you
[37:57.120 --> 37:58.120]  for your support.
[37:58.120 --> 38:04.000]  Here's one more, this is from Michigander in mid-Michigan, highest quality toothpaste,
[38:04.000 --> 38:08.760]  again, five stars, you really only need a pea size of this toothpaste, same thing, especially
[38:08.760 --> 38:12.480]  since it's pricey, I guess they all see it as pricey, I guess something that's $4 and
[38:12.480 --> 38:16.320]  you know, cost them a dollar to make, you know, seems less pricey, but this is not what
[38:16.320 --> 38:21.800]  it is, plus it's a big tube, however, it is enough for a use unlike most others, make
[38:21.800 --> 38:27.000]  sure teeth literally squeaky clean and seems to do an amazing job in every way compared
[38:27.000 --> 38:32.080]  to all other toothpaste I've tried, bought one for myself and my sister during the Christmas
[38:32.080 --> 38:36.240]  special, only halfway through since then, amazing product will never use other toothpaste
[38:36.240 --> 38:41.400]  ever, I would smash a bottle of Colgate or whatever with my foot and smear it on the
[38:41.400 --> 38:47.480]  ground because it's so disgusting, yeah, I forgot to get toothpaste when I was in California
[38:47.480 --> 38:50.760]  and I just said, I'm getting some fluoride toothpaste, it's not bad every once in a while,
[38:50.760 --> 38:54.640]  you know, so I go down to the gift shop at the hotel and it was just like, wasn't even
[38:54.640 --> 38:59.840]  like what Colgate was 10 years ago or 20, it was like, like air, it was just so thin
[38:59.840 --> 39:04.000]  and it was nothing even in there and it didn't even do anything, I was just scrubbing my
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.040]  teeth for like 10 minutes, but this like two minutes is all I need to do and I'm a big
[39:08.040 --> 39:12.360]  brush or my dad's, you know, retired dentist, an oral surgeon and also chemist, but the
[39:12.360 --> 39:18.920]  point is, this is an amazing product, infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com or triple eight, two, five,
[39:18.920 --> 39:24.440]  three, three, one, three, nine and again, folks, 9.95, it's not pricey, you get big tubes
[39:24.440 --> 39:30.360]  of organic toothpaste, you know, they're like six, seven, eight dollars, this has even more
[39:30.360 --> 39:34.720]  stuff added that cost even more in the process to go to one of the big giant companies and
[39:34.720 --> 39:40.240]  then have them set up a whole, you know, factory run for you is expensive when you're only
[39:40.240 --> 39:45.160]  getting 20,000 pieces done, now that sounds like a lot, if we were doing a hundred thousand
[39:45.160 --> 39:50.920]  pieces, I could get the toothpaste for like two dollars, okay, instead of three or four
[39:50.920 --> 39:55.280]  or five dollars, it just depends, first rum is even smaller, so it costs us even more,
[39:55.280 --> 40:01.000]  that's the problem with boutique stuff, it's why limited run stuff always costs more, if
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.400]  people just demanded higher quality in the market, just like they're doing with organics,
[40:04.400 --> 40:09.480]  it would up the market, there'd be more production, prices would fall, that's how supply and demand
[40:09.480 --> 40:14.720]  works, but you first gotta build the market, at first you bring something to market, either
[40:14.720 --> 40:19.640]  fails or succeeds, but it costs you more and people early on usually have to pay more or
[40:19.640 --> 40:25.080]  you've gotta invest, then it tends to become a hit, if it is a hit, and then production
[40:25.080 --> 40:31.640]  goes up, price goes down, that's how real economics works, infowarsstore.com, thank
[40:31.640 --> 40:34.960]  you all for your support, but believe me, you know, the four or five bucks we make on
[40:34.960 --> 40:39.640]  this, we desperately need it, so buy a t-shirt when you're there, buy a Hilary for present
[40:39.640 --> 40:46.440]  27 shirt, 2017, looks like it might happen with Jeff Sessions now, huh folks, so again,
[40:46.440 --> 40:50.040]  infowars is the operation you're building, please support our local AM and FM affiliates
[40:50.040 --> 40:54.240]  as well, and their local sponsors will become a sponsor or send them a donation, because
[40:54.240 --> 40:59.600]  we're now on over 250 plus stations, because listeners are supporting the stations and
[40:59.600 --> 41:03.480]  spreading the word, and you know, infowars is everywhere now, and we're really having
[41:03.480 --> 41:08.400]  a big effect again, Joe Rogan talked to him yesterday, and he said, undoubtedly this is
[41:08.400 --> 41:13.440]  the biggest podcast in history in the world, and they're delisting it off Google, trying
[41:13.440 --> 41:19.000]  to block it off iTunes, also they will not allow it to trend on YouTube, but he added
[41:19.000 --> 41:25.400]  it all together, and this is already double any podcast, basically Joe Rogan's ever had,
[41:25.400 --> 41:30.200]  and he's had some of their eight years, and he's the number one podcaster folks, so understand
[41:30.200 --> 41:37.160]  total domination, and again, I'm not bragging, I want you to understand, we're having a huge
[41:37.160 --> 41:44.000]  effect, he's the number one comic on iTunes, number one on Google, he's in the top 10 undisputed
[41:44.000 --> 41:51.160]  comedians in the world today, and the 9-11 broadcast is the biggest podcast in history,
[41:51.160 --> 41:57.120]  and it's being blocked from the top trends, okay, let's just stop right there, I want
[41:57.120 --> 42:02.160]  to go to our guest until the end of the hour, Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign,
[42:02.160 --> 42:07.640]  a man that also got him to run back in 2000, joins us to cover a lot of big developments,
[42:07.640 --> 42:12.520]  obviously sessions being confirmed yesterday, and a lot more, but also I want to pick your
[42:12.520 --> 42:16.760]  brain, Roger, you know, a lot of times you don't really leak stuff to anybody, including
[42:16.760 --> 42:21.440]  me, you've given me some trends to watch, and they've always come true, but I have
[42:21.440 --> 42:24.920]  a lot of sources telling me that we know who the leakers are in the White House, it's
[42:24.920 --> 42:31.080]  very serious, I have military sources confirming the intel that it appears that a leak did
[42:31.080 --> 42:39.200]  get the targets out to ISIS and al-Qaeda in an attempt to Bay of Pigs, aka Kennedy, embarrassed
[42:39.200 --> 42:44.040]  Trump, we're investigating that more, we certainly have intel that it happened, we're just not
[42:44.040 --> 42:48.960]  exactly sure who, but we do know who's leaking in many cases, and this is just amazing, I
[42:48.960 --> 42:51.760]  don't know if you're ready to get into that, but I need to talk to you over the show today
[42:51.760 --> 42:56.960]  about my sources so we can share notes, but there's so much happening, but first off,
[42:56.960 --> 42:59.840]  congratulations on your book being number one on Amazon Political.
[42:59.840 --> 43:05.160]  Well, thank you very much, Alex, I guess now would probably be the right time to announce
[43:05.160 --> 43:12.280]  that I confess everything, Vladimir Putin dictated every word of my book, every word,
[43:12.280 --> 43:17.200]  he wrote the whole thing, so we might as well get that up front right away.
[43:17.200 --> 43:22.000]  This whole idea that you and I worked for the Russians or that there was any link between
[43:22.000 --> 43:29.800]  the Trump campaign and Russia is getting tedious because it is ridiculously false, just like
[43:29.800 --> 43:36.360]  Vladimir Putin naming your children, by the way, I met your son Nikita, a very nice kid.
[43:36.360 --> 43:37.360]  Yes.
[43:37.360 --> 43:42.080]  It's absurd, the idea that he's writing my book or putting words in Trump's mouth, it's
[43:42.080 --> 43:49.240]  absurd, and the deep state has run this one into the ground, nobody's buying, secondarily
[43:49.240 --> 43:55.520]  I congratulate you on the incredible numbers on this podcast with Joe Rogan, but I understand
[43:55.520 --> 44:02.400]  this whole trend towards censorship, suddenly my Twitter feed is unverified, I had to fight
[44:02.400 --> 44:07.520]  with them to get verified to begin with, but there are several other people posing as Roger
[44:07.520 --> 44:13.640]  Stone, posting nasty stuff, they finally verified me, which had been a long epic battle.
[44:13.640 --> 44:18.360]  And by the way, they kicked Milo off, they've announced they're blocking alt-right material,
[44:18.360 --> 44:22.800]  the Daily Mail, I think it's a great paper, sure they cover some swimsuit stuff and Hollywood
[44:22.800 --> 44:27.160]  news, but so much of the news is really cutting edge, the Daily Mail's been banned as fake
[44:27.160 --> 44:32.000]  news by Wikipedia, I mean Wikipedia's fake compared to them, this is a real purge going
[44:32.000 --> 44:33.000]  on.
[44:33.000 --> 44:39.800]  And I now notice that they have some kind of go slow mechanism, so in the past, if I
[44:39.800 --> 44:43.800]  put up a provocative tweet or a newsworthy tweet, that's right, they've put governors
[44:43.800 --> 44:47.160]  on everybody, we always knew it, now they admit it.
[44:47.160 --> 44:52.720]  Now instead of getting a couple thousand retweets, I'm getting a couple hundred retweets, it
[44:52.720 --> 44:56.600]  is, it is really distressing.
[44:56.600 --> 45:02.280]  You raised the question, what is the president going to do about this new censorship board
[45:02.280 --> 45:08.120]  that has been financed now, approved and financed by the Congress, this was clearly the vehicle
[45:08.120 --> 45:15.480]  Hillary Clinton was going to use to silence us, no one should understand the value of
[45:15.480 --> 45:20.840]  alternative media more than Steve Bannon, who is right there at the president's sleeve.
[45:20.840 --> 45:25.240]  And by the way, just to interrupt, Dr. Corsi's big article at infowars.com there today, got
[45:25.240 --> 45:30.480]  the secret document, it was also then reported in other papers, where Brock is intending
[45:30.480 --> 45:38.480]  to head up this new State Department operation with Snopes and a mail order diploma outfit,
[45:38.480 --> 45:42.040]  that's who supposedly is now going to run things, so I guess Trump needs to be made
[45:42.040 --> 45:45.600]  aware of the fact that his arch enemy, David Brock, I guess is going to be running the
[45:45.600 --> 45:46.600]  State Department.
[45:46.600 --> 45:53.680]  Yeah, it's really extraordinary, congratulations to Dr. Corsi, that was an incredible piece
[45:53.680 --> 45:59.280]  that I think ripped back the veil from exactly what they have going on, that they have to
[45:59.280 --> 46:05.200]  resort to censorship, because the truth kills all cockroaches, that's their real fundamental
[46:05.200 --> 46:07.200]  problem and when people are exposed to it.
[46:07.200 --> 46:12.080]  That's right, and we are wrecking them on every front, Paul has more Twitter impressions
[46:12.080 --> 46:17.560]  than all BBC tweets combined, and he's so big, he hasn't caught them dialing him back
[46:17.560 --> 46:21.880]  too much, though they're starting to freeze his account, Facebook's doing it, I mean clearly
[46:21.880 --> 46:25.320]  they're testing shutting us down.
[46:25.320 --> 46:30.640]  Well perhaps it's because we are the rallying point, this is the resistance, I can't even
[46:30.640 --> 46:35.280]  begin to tell you the number of people, when you go to New York City, when you walk three
[46:35.280 --> 46:40.320]  or four blocks, the number of people, and this is in ultra liberal New York, who come
[46:40.320 --> 46:45.280]  up and say to me, God bless you, God bless Alex, I see you all the time on Info Awards,
[46:45.280 --> 46:49.000]  if it wasn't for you guys, we'd never know the truth, I mean it's heartening, it's really
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.160]  heartening, and they're people from all strata's.
[46:51.160 --> 46:55.800]  Exactly, we're not bragging, I mean we're just number one, Drudge is number one, look
[46:55.800 --> 46:59.920]  at how Drudge says, hey Trump, you better start cutting taxes, and Trump responds in
[46:59.920 --> 47:04.640]  hours, yes Drudge, I'm on it, I mean that's good, that shows how responsive he is.
[47:04.640 --> 47:12.920]  Well I think he understands the coalition that elected him, and the incredible coming
[47:12.920 --> 47:19.160]  together of those voters who were fed up with the rigged system.
[47:19.160 --> 47:23.640]  My concern is whether some of the people around him understand that, we certainly know that
[47:23.640 --> 47:29.600]  Steve Bannon, who I defended on the Charlie Rose show night before last, he understands
[47:29.600 --> 47:35.960]  it, but when you surround yourself with these establishment Republicans who have no loyalty
[47:35.960 --> 47:43.480]  to you, or to your candidacy when you were running, or to your presidency, is it surprising
[47:43.480 --> 47:46.480]  that the White House leaked like a sieve?
[47:46.480 --> 47:53.440]  I mean this is the lowest form of disloyalty, I don't believe are in strategic leaking, if
[47:53.440 --> 47:58.200]  the president orders something leaked for a strategic reason, that's one thing.
[47:58.200 --> 48:00.640]  That's right, you leak only when the president tells you to.
[48:00.640 --> 48:03.720]  Well if you work for the president, or if you're trying to reach some...
[48:03.720 --> 48:06.840]  No I'm saying people inside the White House shouldn't be leaking, but they want to be
[48:06.840 --> 48:12.040]  darlings with the media, and you notice the media loving Rince Priebus, oh my goodness.
[48:12.040 --> 48:18.720]  Yeah, no, look I think that's precisely the problem, so when you're leaking and your leak
[48:18.720 --> 48:25.320]  makes the principle look bad, makes the president look bad, that's beyond disgusting, that is
[48:25.320 --> 48:27.600]  just, that's just treasonous.
[48:27.600 --> 48:30.360]  We have the Washington Post quoting a White House staffer.
[48:30.360 --> 48:33.840]  The president is like a clueless child.
[48:33.840 --> 48:38.440]  We have the New York Times, the president is wandering the halls wearing a bathrobe.
[48:38.440 --> 48:42.880]  Well you know what, the White House is drafty, and if the president wants to wear a bathrobe
[48:42.880 --> 48:46.240]  in the family quarters after hours, who cares?
[48:46.240 --> 48:51.120]  And by the way, he's working till two in the morning, thank God he's working in a bathrobe.
[48:51.120 --> 48:55.440]  Well that place is drafty, I've been there, I've worked there, so this is the kind of
[48:55.440 --> 49:00.480]  net picking that the media loves, but they wouldn't be able to write it if they didn't
[49:00.480 --> 49:01.480]  have to.
[49:01.480 --> 49:04.720]  But I mean, my family asked me to put a bathrobe on when I'm wandering around in my underwear,
[49:04.720 --> 49:09.520]  I mean big deal, again, he has enemies around him, he should completely trust everyone around
[49:09.520 --> 49:10.520]  him.
[49:10.520 --> 49:15.400]  Well, the leakers have to be found, and we're gonna get into this more, I can see in the
[49:15.400 --> 49:21.400]  next couple weeks, I know the president finds these leaks very disappointing, I know he's
[49:21.400 --> 49:27.000]  very unhappy about them, they're very hard to nail down of course, because they're careful.
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.960]  It also shows the elegance, well we know who's doing it, we're gonna give them the info,
[49:30.960 --> 49:35.360]  it shows how dumb certain people are that they think they're gonna get away with leaking
[49:35.360 --> 49:37.880]  when we know basically everybody and everything.
[49:37.880 --> 49:45.560]  Well, and you put your finger on it, the motive of the leakers is self-aggrandizement, the
[49:45.560 --> 49:49.640]  motive of the leakers is to suck up to the reporters they leaked to so they can look
[49:49.640 --> 49:50.640]  more important.
[49:50.640 --> 49:55.440]  I know, and what's crazy is they don't get, being, I told her speaker yesterday, I said
[49:55.440 --> 50:00.200]  I want you to attack me, don't you understand, I don't care, because if you ever endorsed
[50:00.200 --> 50:03.160]  me it would hurt me because the public knows you're scum.
[50:03.160 --> 50:08.760]  Do you understand, I don't want a Fox show, I don't want to be endorsed by them, okay?
[50:08.760 --> 50:14.800]  I'm just pointing out the fact that what's Tucker Carlson doing, having red coat on his
[50:14.800 --> 50:17.640]  show, Piers Morgan, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[50:17.640 --> 50:24.360]  Yeah, no, I share that disappointment, the five books that I have written, this is the
[50:24.360 --> 50:27.720]  only one for which I have not yet been invited.
[50:27.720 --> 50:33.120]  It's because you are so important, you are so effective, it's because of that, if you
[50:33.120 --> 50:36.760]  were a nobody you'd be on all these shows because you'd be controllable, and again,
[50:36.760 --> 50:40.800]  we don't even need to be on their shows, but just look at how pathetic it is, understand
[50:40.800 --> 50:44.760]  that audience, it's because you spread the word, you listen, you spread the links, you
[50:44.760 --> 50:50.480]  support the broadcast that we are destroying them and they cannot stand it, but who's there?
[50:50.480 --> 50:53.480]  Who stood up for your tax cuts when they started to drift off?
[50:53.480 --> 50:58.720]  Matt Drudge, I don't kiss his butt for no reason, the guy without Drudge, we would be
[50:58.720 --> 51:01.680]  up the creek without it, you know what, we'll be back.
[51:01.680 --> 51:02.680]  Happy Valentine's Day honey.

[52:04.680 --> 52:08.960]  I watch several YouTube videos of Stephen Hewars and learn what supplements might help

[54:33.040 --> 54:37.760]  Going down, going down now, down to Chicago.
[54:37.760 --> 54:42.800]  Keep deciding another executive order to increase law enforcement and federal aid into places
[54:42.800 --> 54:43.800]  like Chicago.
[54:43.800 --> 54:45.360]  So he's going down to Chicago.
[54:45.360 --> 54:49.200]  What the world is going on in Chicago, Dr. Jerem Corsi is joining us with Big Breaking
[54:49.200 --> 54:50.200]  News.
[54:50.200 --> 54:55.240]  And then we have Salih Farber, big reporter for major newspapers in Europe, documenting
[54:55.240 --> 54:59.040]  the Islamic rape epidemic and the cover-up of that, that's coming up.
[54:59.040 --> 55:03.800]  And John Rappaport exposing what's really going on at modern colleges is mind control.
[55:03.800 --> 55:06.080]  Roger, what do you make of the sessions?
[55:06.080 --> 55:10.080]  Now, at least Trump's got one more great ally in there, Stephen Bannon.
[55:10.080 --> 55:13.720]  And I know Jeff Sessions is the real McCoy.
[55:13.720 --> 55:15.600]  This is a big victory for the Republic.
[55:15.600 --> 55:20.760]  Yeah, I think Sessions is a very, very solid guy, a true patriot.
[55:20.760 --> 55:25.240]  I don't share his views on the legal marijuana in 32 states.
[55:25.240 --> 55:28.000]  I think he's off base there.
[55:28.000 --> 55:33.320]  But beyond that, he's gonna be a tough, by the book, Law and Order, Attorney General.
[55:33.320 --> 55:40.920]  And you're not gonna have the kind of corruption and abuse that we had under Eric Holder or
[55:40.920 --> 55:43.200]  his successor Loretta Lynch.
[55:43.200 --> 55:47.600]  Oh, he's not gonna meet on airplanes with, he's not gonna meet on airplanes?
[55:47.600 --> 55:48.600]  No, nonsense guy.
[55:48.600 --> 55:50.000]  He was gonna do it by the book.
[55:50.000 --> 55:51.000]  It's about time.
[55:51.000 --> 55:55.280]  What do you make of Schumer saying it turned his stomach when he, it was confirmed, looking
[55:55.280 --> 55:56.920]  at Schumer turns my stomach?
[55:56.920 --> 56:01.440]  Yeah, he is, the guy's a miski, he's just, he's an awful human being.
[56:01.440 --> 56:07.120]  And everyone knows that if you want Chuck, you merely need to deliver a sizable special
[56:07.120 --> 56:09.080]  interest campaign contribution.
[56:09.080 --> 56:13.080]  He is the senator, not just for Wall Street, but of Wall Street.
[56:13.080 --> 56:16.760]  If you take that credit card out of your pocket, and you wonder why the interest rates are
[56:16.760 --> 56:19.960]  so high on the balance, you can thank Chuck Schumer.
[56:19.960 --> 56:21.200]  That's his legislation.
[56:21.200 --> 56:24.920]  I'm sure the banks rewarded him with enormous campaign.
[56:24.920 --> 56:25.920]  That's right.
[56:25.920 --> 56:29.920]  He is a known loan shark supporter, Loretta Sloan's on poor people, I mean, high-trash
[56:29.920 --> 56:30.920]  loans.
[56:30.920 --> 56:31.920]  He's a real monster.
[56:31.920 --> 56:36.720]  It looks like a villain out of a movie, but his actions are a true pedigree.
[56:36.720 --> 56:38.360]  In the last few minutes, what else is on the radar?
[56:38.360 --> 56:39.440]  A lot happening.
[56:39.440 --> 56:40.840]  What else are you focused on?
[56:40.840 --> 56:46.080]  Well, I'd like you, I'm very happy that the president is now gonna turn to his tax reform
[56:46.080 --> 56:48.280]  plan and to tax relief.
[56:48.280 --> 56:54.560]  I honestly believe his plan to cut the corporate tax rate could be the single greatest generator
[56:54.560 --> 56:57.760]  of jobs in decades.
[56:57.760 --> 57:02.360]  Larry Kudlow has written very eloquently on this subject.
[57:02.360 --> 57:03.360]  That's right.
[57:03.360 --> 57:06.440]  Now, a lot of top economists are saying we were already going into deep recession when
[57:06.440 --> 57:07.440]  Obama left.
[57:07.440 --> 57:09.280]  We need to supercharge now.
[57:09.280 --> 57:10.280]  Absolutely.
[57:10.280 --> 57:15.560]  And I think that is what the president and the team around him are working on and focusing
[57:15.560 --> 57:16.560]  on.
[57:16.560 --> 57:20.840]  So, Alex, thanks for the successful launch of the book.
[57:20.840 --> 57:25.800]  It is, it's going extraordinarily well, despite the efforts of the New York Times and the
[57:25.800 --> 57:27.720]  Washington Post to ignore it.
[57:27.720 --> 57:29.920]  They both sent for copies in advance.
[57:29.920 --> 57:32.600]  They were both given copies in advance.
[57:32.600 --> 57:39.360]  I'm not holding my breath, waiting for the review, but I am signing like there's no tomorrow
[57:39.360 --> 57:45.920]  because if you buy this book on Infowars, I will sign it and I'm doing them all by hand.
[57:45.920 --> 57:48.200]  I'm not gonna use a stamp or something phony.
[57:48.200 --> 57:53.520]  So, if there's a delay in getting your signed book, please bear with me, I'm signing as
[57:53.520 --> 57:54.520]  fast as I can.
[57:54.520 --> 57:55.880]  Yeah, and I've got to get to signing.
[57:55.880 --> 57:58.440]  I'm gonna have to stop in a few days, but if you get your order in now, I will sign
[57:58.440 --> 58:00.520]  it as well as not up to 15,000 books.
[58:00.520 --> 58:02.240]  Roger's gonna sign them all.
[58:02.240 --> 58:04.120]  Roger Stone making the president of Forrestore.com.
[58:04.120 --> 58:09.280]  In closing, Milo has nicely invited me out to Florida for a big victory deal on the beach,
[58:09.280 --> 58:14.040]  you know, party against the control freaks, but maybe you should come to be a chaperone
[58:14.040 --> 58:15.040]  just to protect...
[58:15.040 --> 58:17.760]  Yeah, I'd better, because you guys will definitely get in trouble if I'm not there.
[58:17.760 --> 58:22.360]  Well, yeah, you know, so I need you there is like, you know, protect me.
[58:22.360 --> 58:24.680]  Let me know when and I'll be happy to provide...
[58:24.680 --> 58:25.680]  Of course, I'm joking.
[58:25.680 --> 58:26.680]  I don't think I'm Milo's type.
[58:26.680 --> 58:30.000]  I think he likes black guys, but seriously, Milo is really a funny guy fighting for free
[58:30.000 --> 58:31.520]  speech as well, being citizens as well.
[58:31.520 --> 58:32.520]  All right.
[58:32.520 --> 58:33.520]  Well, I'll make you see in Florida next week.
[58:33.520 --> 58:34.520]  Roger, thank you so much.
[58:34.520 --> 58:35.520]  Sounds great.
[58:35.520 --> 58:36.520]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[58:36.520 --> 58:37.520]  All right.
[58:37.520 --> 58:42.160]  We'll be back with hour number two straight ahead.
[58:42.160 --> 58:54.760]  We have a priest in New Jersey who is starting to sound like one of us.
[58:54.760 --> 58:59.480]  Father Peter West, a Catholic priest in the Archdiocese of Newark, is an avid Trump supporter
[58:59.480 --> 59:00.880]  and not afraid to show it.
[59:00.880 --> 59:05.600]  This is a priest who posts on social media daily, taking on such topics as radical Islam,
[59:05.600 --> 59:08.120]  millennial safe spaces, and modern day liberals.
[59:08.120 --> 59:12.280]  Now Father West has fallen under scrutiny from some of his colleagues who believe he is acting
[59:12.280 --> 59:14.560]  inappropriately and has gone too far.
[59:14.560 --> 59:19.760]  In 2004, a former St. Louis Archbishop, Cardinal Raymond Burke, took a hard political stance
[59:19.760 --> 59:25.240]  when he refused to allow the at-the-time Senator John Kerry to receive communion for his pro-choice
[59:25.240 --> 59:26.240]  views.
[59:26.240 --> 59:30.360]  Now, Burke is an avid Trump supporter who has spoken out against radical Islam and was
[59:30.360 --> 59:36.360]  demoted in 2014 by Pope Francis from the head of the Vatican's highest court to a ceremonial
[59:36.360 --> 59:39.720]  position because of his public disagreements with Pope Francis.
[59:39.720 --> 59:43.820]  It's not surprising that Father West is gaining national attention and support because going
[59:43.820 --> 59:47.080]  against political correctness is growing in popularity.
[59:47.080 --> 59:53.600]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com, so not PC.
[59:53.600 --> 1:00:23.440]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:23.440 --> 1:00:38.720]  We have a corrupt elite in power and we're blasting them out of their places as we speak.
[1:00:38.720 --> 1:00:45.200]  The banner of human liberty, the banner of humans, is moving forward against the technocrats
[1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:51.960]  that dream they were gods because they sat here with all the technology that their fellow
[1:00:51.960 --> 1:00:56.960]  humans had developed and believed that they owned it all, old-fashioned megalomania writ
[1:00:56.960 --> 1:00:57.960]  large.
[1:00:57.960 --> 1:01:04.560]  I would open the phones up, not that I have lack of news, boy, there is a lot of it, but
[1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:09.240]  I would open the phones up specifically for first-time callers before Dr. Corsi joins us
[1:01:09.240 --> 1:01:11.920]  at the bottom of the hour to say, what do you think of Trump so far?
[1:01:11.920 --> 1:01:14.040]  What do you think of sessions?
[1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:15.040]  What do you think of the wall?
[1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:17.040]  What do you think of killing carbon taxes?
[1:01:17.040 --> 1:01:18.880]  Does the Republicans still push it?
[1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:20.760]  And what do you think of the top six Republicans?
[1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:28.080]  You guys reprinted me that from two days ago, sorry, the headline was backstabbers.
[1:01:28.080 --> 1:01:33.880]  Top six Republicans got massive Soros funding, and you can see their agenda, globalism.
[1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:38.960]  And Renz Priebus up there, Renz Priebus is doing some nasty stuff, man, he'll call in
[1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:43.040]  patriots through the administration and go, president wants you to resign.
[1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:46.400]  And they'll go, I'll run for the president and they'll say, yeah, get your stuff, get
[1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:47.400]  out of here.
[1:01:47.400 --> 1:01:50.840]  They'll be moving somebody into their office and then they'll go, actually ask the president,
[1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:51.840]  the president goes, no, stay here.
[1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:52.840]  I didn't say that.
[1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:58.240]  So Priebus is kind of like an alien getting over by the airlock.
[1:01:58.240 --> 1:02:04.080]  Sigourney Weaver is Trump going, oh, oh, airlock, oh, bye-bye.
[1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:10.000]  Maybe he could scrabble back under the skirts of somebody, but I don't, I think the goblin
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  guide has given the golden toad quite enough of a, quite enough of a tour of the catacombs.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.240]  So that's all coming up.
[1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:27.560]  By the way, talk about marketing.
[1:02:27.560 --> 1:02:28.880]  I'm not a marketing genius.
[1:02:28.880 --> 1:02:30.840]  I just promote and sell what I believe in.
[1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:32.960]  I wasn't going to do a plug right now, but when we come back, I'm going to take your
[1:02:32.960 --> 1:02:39.120]  calls and I'm going to plug now, 800-25 at 99-231, 800-25 at 99-231 is the number to
[1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:40.120]  join us.
[1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:42.680]  Probably any issue you want, but I'd like to get into these big ones here.
[1:02:42.680 --> 1:02:46.200]  We just mentioned 800-25 at 99-231.
[1:02:46.200 --> 1:02:51.320]  But I was sitting here from the amazing folks at my Patriots supply that produce the Alexa
[1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:56.040]  Pure Water Filters and the Alexa Breeze air filters, they're all game changing, very low
[1:02:56.040 --> 1:02:57.040]  price for what you get.
[1:02:57.040 --> 1:02:59.600]  We sell them all at infowarstore.com.
[1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:03.480]  And I was familiar with this type of technology because the price is really, really again,
[1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:10.640]  very, very affordable on these, but they're calling it a filter on the go for your car.
[1:03:10.640 --> 1:03:12.080]  But it's not really an air filter.
[1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:14.920]  As you look at it, it plugs in the cigarette lighter.
[1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:19.200]  I said, that looks like an ionizer.
[1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:24.800]  And sure enough, it's got a really low price for an ionizer that goes in your car.
[1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:27.400]  It works really good.
[1:03:27.400 --> 1:03:34.480]  But you should call it not the Breeze micro, but something like the workhorse, negative
[1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:39.480]  ion charger, because that's what it does and it just knocks out the pollen, the bacteria.
[1:03:39.480 --> 1:03:43.680]  I mean, this is something that is really good for your car.
[1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:47.160]  And really, you just leave this in there when you're driving around, clears out all those
[1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:51.040]  smells, kids spilt milk in the car a month ago, you're still smelling it no matter how
[1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:53.720]  many times you shampoo it, believe me, I know.
[1:03:53.720 --> 1:03:56.600]  These babies are perfect for things like that.
[1:03:56.600 --> 1:03:57.840]  It's amazing.
[1:03:57.840 --> 1:03:58.840]  It's available.
[1:03:58.840 --> 1:04:03.480]  We'll put it up on screen at infoorstore.com.
[1:04:03.480 --> 1:04:06.000]  It's only 1995.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:07.800]  And again, it should be advertised.
[1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:08.800]  That's our advertising.
[1:04:08.800 --> 1:04:09.800]  This is what it is.
[1:04:09.800 --> 1:04:13.640]  People look at this and go, this is an air purifier, no, no.
[1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:18.760]  It's basically like a micro ozone generator, but they've gotten better than ozone generators
[1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:19.760]  over the years.
[1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:26.960]  What you want is negative ions, mold spores, pollen, pet dander, odor, cigarette smoke,
[1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:30.080]  bacteria, viruses, dust, and other airborne particles.
[1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:32.280]  This is the super product.
[1:04:32.280 --> 1:04:33.280]  No reviews yet.
[1:04:33.280 --> 1:04:34.760]  My review is it's excellent.
[1:04:34.760 --> 1:04:39.200]  Let's show the other great products from the folks at Alexa Pure.
[1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:40.200]  What a great name they chose.
[1:04:40.200 --> 1:04:41.760]  And they came out with all this few years ago.
[1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:44.160]  I almost looked at it in mind for a show.
[1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:48.440]  They wanted to sell it all, but I'm telling you, I use this stuff in my house.
[1:04:48.440 --> 1:04:52.480]  They're purifiers, they're air purifiers, because they're the best out there at like
[1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:53.480]  half the cost.
[1:04:53.480 --> 1:04:55.000]  They are a game-changing company.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:58.400]  There's a reason my Patriot Supply only started like eight years ago, was already the biggest
[1:04:58.400 --> 1:04:59.400]  company in the world.
[1:04:59.400 --> 1:05:00.400]  It's horrible food.
[1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:01.400]  They dominate.
[1:05:01.400 --> 1:05:04.600]  We have a priest in New Jersey who is starting to sound like one of us.
[1:05:04.600 --> 1:05:09.520]  Father Peter West, a Catholic priest in the Archdiocese of Newark, is an avid Trump supporter
[1:05:09.520 --> 1:05:10.920]  and not afraid to show it.
[1:05:10.920 --> 1:05:15.640]  This is a priest who posts on social media daily, taking on such topics as radical Islam,
[1:05:15.640 --> 1:05:18.160]  millennial safe spaces, and modern-day liberals.
[1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:21.760]  Now Father West has fallen under scrutiny from some of his colleagues who believe he
[1:05:21.760 --> 1:05:24.600]  is acting inappropriately and has gone too far.
[1:05:24.600 --> 1:05:29.800]  In 2004, a former St. Louis Archbishop, Cardinal Raymond Burke, took a hard political stance
[1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:35.240]  when he refused to allow the at-the-time Senator John Kerry to receive communion for his pro-choice
[1:05:35.240 --> 1:05:36.240]  views.
[1:05:36.240 --> 1:05:40.400]  Now, Burke is an avid Trump supporter who has spoken out against radical Islam and was
[1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:46.440]  demoted in 2014 by Pope Francis from the head of the Vatican's highest court to a ceremonial
[1:05:46.440 --> 1:05:49.800]  position because of his public disagreements with Pope Francis.
[1:05:49.800 --> 1:05:53.880]  It's not surprising that Father West is gaining national attention and support because going
[1:05:53.880 --> 1:05:57.160]  against political correctness is growing in popularity.
[1:05:57.160 --> 1:06:27.000]  This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com, so not PC.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:53.960]  Your body will be very grateful.
[1:06:53.960 --> 1:07:05.940]  The
[1:07:05.940 --> 1:07:10.640]  People are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[1:07:10.640 --> 1:07:16.860]  I try to make sure I don't put toxins from food and beverages in my system, but...
[1:07:16.860 --> 1:07:19.200]  Right now, we are dealing with massive parasites.
[1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:25.340]  Which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[1:07:26.240 --> 1:07:31.560]  Spreading disease around we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites
[1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:33.920]  Tell us about all the stuff that there's so many things that are in it
[1:07:33.920 --> 1:07:38.280]  You have the name in there you have the organic clove bud the organic wormwood
[1:07:38.280 --> 1:07:42.160]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right
[1:07:42.160 --> 1:07:44.900]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today
[1:07:44.900 --> 1:07:49.760]  It just came back in yesterday living defense info wars live calm and folks you can't lose full of stuff
[1:07:49.760 --> 1:07:56.880]  It's great for your body period and you support the broadcast info wars live calm. Thank you doctor group from the Global Healing Center
[1:07:56.880 --> 1:08:14.340]  Thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product
[1:08:14.340 --> 1:08:21.620]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[1:08:21.620 --> 1:08:27.580]  So does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones
[1:08:28.220 --> 1:08:30.100]  And we're doing it
[1:08:30.100 --> 1:08:34.900]  You know Twitter began massively publicly censoring conservatives in the last two days
[1:08:35.260 --> 1:08:37.700]  Kicking them off taking their verified status away
[1:08:38.420 --> 1:08:42.700]  Restricting how people can even share their tweets and so their stock is plunging
[1:08:42.700 --> 1:08:51.340]  But Facebook starting to censor more Google is censoring more again. I go back to this because Joe Rogan has the number one comedy show
[1:08:51.500 --> 1:08:57.500]  On itunes other platforms in the world. He's in the top ten, you know hosted three or four major shows on Comedy Central
[1:08:58.100 --> 1:09:01.180]  UFC host movie star TV star you name it
[1:09:01.660 --> 1:09:03.660]  remember thing from fear factor to
[1:09:03.940 --> 1:09:05.940]  movies he does with
[1:09:05.980 --> 1:09:08.480]  all the big top comedians and
[1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:12.320]  And he said no hands down. This is the biggest thing I've ever done
[1:09:12.840 --> 1:09:17.200]  This podcast with you is just everywhere people on the street all over the place
[1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:21.880]  It's gonna end up. It's like 40 something million right now. It's gonna end up being a hundred million
[1:09:22.760 --> 1:09:24.760]  probably by the end of the month and
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:32.360]  They've just delisted it from all the major trending sites where you can't see that it's the number one thing in the world
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:39.000]  Let me explain something if it's had 40 plus million views on seven different platforms
[1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:42.760]  That's it's four hours long. It's like three hours and 45 minutes long
[1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:46.600]  Unprecedented have that many views with something that long because they have an algorithm
[1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:48.600]  They don't just let you watch five minutes and call it a viewer
[1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:55.000]  That's a lot of people watching something longer than the Super Bowl. The Super Bowl has 80 million people
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:04.680]  Billions are made on it. I go do a podcast and it's going to have a hundred million people by the end of the month the trends show
[1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:08.160]  It's already the biggest podcast ever
[1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:11.920]  But wait
[1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:17.440]  Paul Watson so far in the last seven days has 18 plus
[1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:21.960]  million views on my Facebook video page alone
[1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:23.960]  18 million
[1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:29.600]  Let's say it again. Go look 18
[1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:32.600]  million views of
[1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:34.120]  Paul
[1:10:34.120 --> 1:10:36.120]  Watson's five
[1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:37.760]  videos
[1:10:37.760 --> 1:10:43.400]  Then you go to his channel. There's tens of millions more you go to the YouTube millions more. It's a joke
[1:10:44.080 --> 1:10:48.320]  That's why I again. I'm not up here announcing. I'm big. I'm the greatest. I'm the best
[1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:53.200]  It's this weird paradox of you want the truth. You're hungry for it
[1:10:53.720 --> 1:10:55.880]  The leftist that listen to Joe show
[1:10:56.480 --> 1:11:01.640]  I'd say about 60% of what you call liberals but but well-meaning ones. They're all I love Alex Jones now
[1:11:01.640 --> 1:11:05.720]  I never I always believe lies about him or sauce about a context. I agree with this
[1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:11.000]  This is crazy. He's he's had more podcasts with big guests. They're like, I actually like Alex Jones
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.520]  Why I heard it and I couldn't believe it. It all made sense
[1:11:15.360 --> 1:11:17.360]  That's what happens
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:22.300]  They've had the New York Times three times in the last three days attack me in big stories
[1:11:23.240 --> 1:11:31.240]  Washington Post two times again. I'm not bragging. This isn't Alex Jones's head got big. It's we're killing them. You're killing them
[1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:37.640]  You heard that intro. We're gonna stop tyranny. We're gonna take America back that intro is 19 years old
[1:11:42.280 --> 1:11:45.880]  It it wasn't some overnight success so
[1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:49.400]  I am completely humble this broadcast is our team
[1:11:49.400 --> 1:11:54.120]  It's you it's everybody together and obviously it was Joe Rogan's audience and my audience coming together. The point is
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:12:03.760]  Is that it wasn't about left or right I went on his show and was real with people for almost four hours and it's got like a
[1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:06.480]  97%
[1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:08.960]  Positive up vote on YouTube
[1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:17.440]  Joe's never had anything that positive. I mean he said stuff close because you put two dominant winners together who are both into freedom
[1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:22.320]  It's explosive. It's like putting uranium and plutonium together. There's going to be an explosion
[1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:25.160]  but
[1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:27.640]  Everywhere they game it they throttle it back
[1:12:27.640 --> 1:12:33.400]  They have throttles at key points when it's peaking they just throttle it where you can't see it or suddenly it's not available or
[1:12:33.400 --> 1:12:39.760]  And notice I've always said they're governing stuff. They're throttling it back now Twitter admits
[1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:43.080]  Oh, we're throttling back the conservative viral news. Oh
[1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:45.760]  They still let you tweet
[1:12:46.040 --> 1:12:48.480]  It just has one percent of the effect and goes into a black hole
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:55.560]  It's like taking a you know people that are trying to protest taken to a free speech zone four miles away from the actual event
[1:12:55.600 --> 1:12:59.440]  Yeah, you can yell and scream all you want here in this free speech zone, but nobody can hear you
[1:12:59.440 --> 1:13:04.760]  People say well, don't you dislike protesters? I love protesters free speech go out and have your speech heard
[1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:11.000]  Don't go attack me or shoot a cop in the back because George Soros funded you
[1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:17.760]  So I'm gonna go to your phone calls right now, but there's so much to get to but the Twitter police are openly targeting conservatives
[1:13:17.760 --> 1:13:21.520]  They're going now from denying. They were doing this to doing it
[1:13:24.360 --> 1:13:27.920]  And it's on okay, let me read you a few headlines that are coming up that I'm gonna go to your phone calls
[1:13:27.920 --> 1:13:32.060]  Some of this already covered but a lot of it. I haven't trumped to drudge
[1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:38.680]  Phenomenal tax cut package coming in two to three weeks responds to drudge in hours drudge Republican Party should be sued for fraud
[1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:47.080]  Absolutely, but show George Soros scum. In fact, where's my George Soros article? Niko brought that in during the break. Oh
[1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:51.520]  I'll just go to your phone calls. I've got hundreds of articles. It's just it's just insane
[1:13:53.160 --> 1:13:55.160]  Gives me a headache
[1:13:55.160 --> 1:13:59.840]  I'm trying to get back in really good shape and I did like 30 pull-ups
[1:14:00.600 --> 1:14:02.600]  last
[1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:04.520]  Friday I
[1:14:04.520 --> 1:14:06.000]  Made myself
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.680]  because I could do pull-ups even though I'm big and oh
[1:14:09.640 --> 1:14:16.280]  It just knocked my neck out into my back and I am just I'm a little bit of not really annoying. Oh man
[1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:22.120]  Anyway, so there it is backstabbers Paul Ryan Lindsey Graham John McCain Marco Rubio
[1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:25.240]  Jeb Bush took campaign cash from Soros. Go read it
[1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:32.360]  It's public. It's it's the all fake news fake news. Oh, yeah, really. We're just showing you the federal elections commission
[1:14:32.360 --> 1:14:35.600]  It's a fact and you know, it's true to quote Sammy Hagar
[1:14:36.680 --> 1:14:38.360]  then coming up
[1:14:38.360 --> 1:14:42.480]  Kremlin confirms accidental Russian airstrike kills circus soldiers in Syria a
[1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:49.520]  Ledge gang rate shown on Facebook shocked Sweden. We have one of the journalists coming on that's gonna detail it
[1:14:49.520 --> 1:14:55.720]  With Wikipedia bans unreliable daily mail of source won't they ban themself most government workers should be replaced by robots
[1:14:55.720 --> 1:15:02.320]  New study finds and said the government workers have decided to replace our jobs at least in socialist countries like France and China with the robots
[1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:08.720]  Intel to invest 7 billion in factory in Arizona employ 3,000 because of Trump CNBC
[1:15:09.680 --> 1:15:11.680]  Report CNN caught handing out
[1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:14.640]  Questions at Cruz Sanders debate, of course they did
[1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:22.240]  Razors porn site blocked in Russia for negative influence on human psyche. You can say hey, don't block porn that blocks pre-speech
[1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:28.680]  Okay, well, you're gonna block news saying it's fake. The Russians can then block porn because that's a lot more reasonable. I
[1:15:31.520 --> 1:15:33.520]  Mean, let me tell you
[1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:39.480]  Porn ain't what it was back in the 1980s. I'm here to tell you. I mean it is I've gone. I've looked at it
[1:15:39.480 --> 1:15:40.840]  It's like what the hell is this?
[1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:44.520]  I mean, this is what kids have access to in many areas of the country in the world
[1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:48.680]  This is it's this is not sex. This is not love. This is a
[1:15:52.840 --> 1:16:00.320]  Dehumanization and the globalist admit that's the plan Germany asylum seeker arrested after abusing 18 women during two-hour train
[1:16:00.320 --> 1:16:02.320]  Journey because that's what you do to women
[1:16:02.920 --> 1:16:06.360]  And we have a guest coming up to break all that down from Europe
[1:16:06.360 --> 1:16:12.920]  Other big articles out today dealing with science. We're gonna getting to it right now. We've got Miranda
[1:16:14.840 --> 1:16:22.400]  Todd Josh Terry Jake and others. Let's go to the great state of Michigan and talk to Miranda. You're on the air
[1:16:24.920 --> 1:16:26.920]  Yes, ma'am go ahead
[1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:34.480]  I just wanted to say that it's really refreshing to see Trump
[1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:40.800]  I'm telling it like it is and not all this fake stuff all the time like CNN and
[1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:49.440]  I'm also pretty embarrassed for my generation. I'm 26 and like the people in the women's much
[1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:54.160]  They want to be a part of something, but they don't really know what's going on
[1:16:55.920 --> 1:16:57.360]  And it's just pressure well
[1:16:57.360 --> 1:17:02.640]  They're out there supporting radical Islam and say put women under burkas because it's it long as it's anti-american
[1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:08.400]  Anti-Western they love it. I mean, that's what they are. They're not pro women. They're they're in a they're in a cock cult
[1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:10.840]  so
[1:17:10.840 --> 1:17:13.760]  That's what they're doing and and you're absolutely right
[1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:18.280]  But look Trump is even though I disagree with sessions on this whole marijuana war
[1:17:19.280 --> 1:17:23.220]  I don't really smoke marijuana, but the point is when I smoke it ever once in a while to test it out
[1:17:23.760 --> 1:17:25.760]  Literally, I don't like the way it makes me feel
[1:17:25.800 --> 1:17:30.120]  But but I've smoked marijuana ever once in a while and you just like I'll be at a party or something
[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:32.640]  I'm like, yeah, let me see the state of marijuana. I'm like, whoa, that is strong
[1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:34.400]  So I'm come on here and talk about how strong it is
[1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:38.480]  I don't think kids should be spoken about but it has a lot of medical reasons and it has a lot of things for glaucoma
[1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:41.120]  You name it. It's an amazing plant God gave us
[1:17:41.120 --> 1:17:44.240]  So I don't think session should be on this big war on drug kick
[1:17:44.240 --> 1:17:51.360]  But he's so honorable when it comes to law and prosecuting criminals and going after government corruption and defending our sovereignty
[1:17:51.360 --> 1:17:56.600]  It's refreshing because he really means what he's doing and and and you know, he's a noble person
[1:17:56.600 --> 1:18:01.120]  So even though I disagree with Trump like I said on torture at least he's being honest about it. Go ahead
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  and it's totally I
[1:18:05.040 --> 1:18:07.040]  grew up listening to you honestly and
[1:18:07.840 --> 1:18:13.560]  It's so frustrating to watch CNN every night and just here like lie after lie after lie
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:19.920]  And it's like I just wish that somebody would tell the truth and finally Trump comes around and it's like, yeah
[1:18:19.920 --> 1:18:26.680]  Finally, it's like a breath of fresh air, isn't it? I've been underwater and you're you know, you're dying for oxygen
[1:18:26.680 --> 1:18:29.080]  You finally hit the surface. How old are you Miranda?
[1:18:30.120 --> 1:18:34.320]  26. All right. Well, thank you and God bless you for calling in and listening. Please keep spreading the word
[1:18:34.320 --> 1:18:39.280]  The real power is you spreading the word. It's it's like wildfire. It's unstoppable
[1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:43.320]  Josh in Colorado up there in the Rockies. You're on the air Josh
[1:18:44.200 --> 1:18:47.760]  Hey, Alex. I've been listening 10 years now big fan
[1:18:47.760 --> 1:18:50.960]  I want to talk about the tax cuts, you know
[1:18:50.960 --> 1:18:53.760]  I've been working on getting out of debt for about 10 years now
[1:18:53.760 --> 1:19:00.280]  And I'd be out of debt by now if I wouldn't lose a third of my check to the government for forced healthcare and all the taxes
[1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:05.960]  And I'm like an independent inventor. I've been trying to invent some stuff for Tesla technology
[1:19:05.960 --> 1:19:11.560]  But I can't get my the government off my head, you know, and it's driving big corporations lobby
[1:19:11.840 --> 1:19:14.680]  To have regulations to shut down their competition. It's a fact
[1:19:14.680 --> 1:19:17.560]  Well, I led a movement in
[1:19:18.560 --> 1:19:27.240]  2012 called the Million Volt March and I had so many backstabbers coming at me doing this March and you know, it's it's hard out there

[1:19:39.600 --> 1:19:46.520]  That are kind of there at the low level that feel like their failures. So they try to glom on to anything low level and bring it down
[1:19:46.520 --> 1:19:50.040]  Or take control of it. You have to learn to never even talk about them
[1:19:50.040 --> 1:19:56.600]  And and what happened to you when you try to do something good and just move forward never giving the failure any attention
[1:19:57.200 --> 1:20:00.400]  I'm gonna give people the big secret on the other side. Okay, the big one

[1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:19.440]  They have bots that do this as well that will then be on both sides saying I hate white people
[1:25:19.440 --> 1:25:21.940]  I hate black people or I hate Hispanic people
[1:25:23.160 --> 1:25:25.840]  Just to get a fight going on that's in the wiki leaks
[1:25:26.240 --> 1:25:32.560]  They've got all these other computer programs that do it sorrows spent hundreds of millions in the last few years on this
[1:25:32.560 --> 1:25:34.240]  That's in the news
[1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:41.360]  That's just sorrows. There's scores of big foundations. So the secret isn't Oprah Winfrey's just believe something
[1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:44.000]  You know pray to the universe and it's gonna happen
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:48.760]  You're not gonna pray for a Taj Mahal to pop up, you know in your backyard and then it just happens
[1:25:48.880 --> 1:25:52.000]  You've got to own the property. You've got to have the will you've got to have the
[1:25:53.280 --> 1:26:00.960]  Again, but believing in something and believing something that's good and taking action and working with others that can manifest itself over time
[1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:04.120]  Humans are made in the image of God. We can create things
[1:26:04.920 --> 1:26:09.880]  But if you want to talk about free energy or talk about things that are being suppressed just talk about that
[1:26:10.880 --> 1:26:16.840]  Don't talk about oh, I tried all this and they were backstabbers everything move on just forget that energy. I
[1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:22.200]  Mean people all the time say, how are you taking it? You got attacked in a hundred newspapers yesterday and I heard them on NPR
[1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:26.040]  Saying lies. They're the scum. They're the liars. I'm very proud of it
[1:26:26.040 --> 1:26:32.440]  People that know they're discredited scum are gonna know I must be good. We better check Alex Jones out
[1:26:33.640 --> 1:26:37.560]  So I don't really spend my time responding but to 1% of it and when I do respond
[1:26:37.560 --> 1:26:40.880]  It's to educate people about their lies and how they operate not about me
[1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:45.960]  So the biggest thing of being an activist is have your issues
[1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:54.000]  Move forward and when weirdos show up and project their own stuff on you or show up and want you to end fight with them or or
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  Or or you know
[1:26:56.280 --> 1:26:59.080]  let's say you've got a former employee that doesn't want to work and
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:05.480]  Then they're gone and then to make themselves sound good, you know, they talk trash about you and make stuff up
[1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:07.480]  That's what losers do
[1:27:07.560 --> 1:27:09.560]  Move on as a winner
[1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:12.640]  Okay, and then and then let the dead bury the dead politically
[1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:16.320]  Again
[1:27:16.320 --> 1:27:18.320]  Political movements aren't gonna happen overnight
[1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:26.360]  What you should do is start a blog make it interesting take photos interview people care about things and then don't just be ready to be a
[1:27:26.360 --> 1:27:32.560]  Victim this whole social justice warrior thing is about being a victim and people were mean to you or things didn't go
[1:27:32.560 --> 1:27:34.560]  Well or you failed
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:36.720]  Instead of if you're promoting real tenants of freedom
[1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:42.560]  It isn't even about the money or fame you get from and it's about changing things and you will change things you have power
[1:27:44.040 --> 1:27:46.040]  So if you want to promote
[1:27:46.040 --> 1:27:52.760]  New forms of energy, let's talk about new forms of energy. They're suppressing. I think the caller hung up from
[1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:55.200]  Colorado
[1:27:55.200 --> 1:27:58.040]  Young up and by the way, I wasn't criticizing the caller
[1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:06.040]  It's just that the reason info wars has been so successful is I never was involved in infighting
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:10.840]  all these people for their own mental illnesses their own modern problems their own
[1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:19.760]  Idiosyncrasies would always in radio and TV and media internet would want to dominate me because they wanted to be the top fish
[1:28:21.240 --> 1:28:23.240]  Or the top gorilla
[1:28:23.960 --> 1:28:28.680]  You know the guy on top of the pile. I wanted to stop the new world order. I
[1:28:29.680 --> 1:28:31.680]  Don't care about being number one and
[1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:37.240]  So I would never divert myself into all the infighting and weirdness because somebody tuned in to talk radio
[1:28:37.240 --> 1:28:41.760]  Hearing talk show hosts fighting with each other and people threatened each other and weird crap
[1:28:41.800 --> 1:28:48.760]  That may play to a few weird mentally ill trolls that listen, but it doesn't play to the general audience that wants freedom
[1:28:49.400 --> 1:28:57.240]  So you resonate towards the intelligent the informed the spiritual the involved the enlightened the people that want to affect change
[1:28:57.240 --> 1:28:59.240]  The people that want to build a better world
[1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:02.360]  That's the big secret and if you do that, you'll change the world
[1:29:02.360 --> 1:29:07.920]  We got Jack and Washington was about Trump judge travel man and what's going on on college campuses?
[1:29:08.040 --> 1:29:13.040]  We've also got Todd was talking about Trump Obama in DAA CIA going over the media

[1:29:28.880 --> 1:29:35.320]  But I thought President Trump was a new president. He's not in full control folks. We've got to make him and others aware of it
[1:29:35.320 --> 1:29:37.320]  That's what we do as
[1:29:37.320 --> 1:29:42.760]  Watchmen and women on the wall as modern 21st century Paul Revere's I'm Alex Jones
[1:29:42.760 --> 1:29:48.080]  They hate the website info wars comm spread that link spread those stories

[1:32:06.040 --> 1:32:10.080]  Metals in the liver cause peroxides to get dumped into the bloodstream
[1:32:10.360 --> 1:32:16.800]  Peroxides do more damage and free radicals to the arteries and the LDL has no protection from peroxides
[1:32:17.080 --> 1:32:21.280]  Causing the LDL to get stuck in the arteries creating a potential blockage
[1:32:21.800 --> 1:32:28.440]  Extendivites slowly chelates the metals away from the liver so it can dispose of what was meant to be a harmless process

[1:33:00.200 --> 1:33:10.200]  The New World Order
[1:33:11.600 --> 1:33:19.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:33:22.600 --> 1:33:27.600]  President Trump came out over the weekend as that the media is covering up whitewashing and under reporting Islamic terror
[1:33:27.600 --> 1:33:30.280]  The media had to say well we reported on most of these
[1:33:30.280 --> 1:33:36.760]  Yeah, you didn't report on some and you under reported on others and they ordered the Department of Homeland Security going back seven years ago
[1:33:37.400 --> 1:33:44.120]  To stop using the word Islamic terror and the media stopped using the term so you didn't just censor that it was happening
[1:33:44.120 --> 1:33:46.120]  You censored what it was
[1:33:46.840 --> 1:33:52.240]  That'd be like in World War two, you know don't call Nazi invasion of North Africa Nazi
[1:33:52.760 --> 1:33:54.760]  What are you supposed to call it then?
[1:33:54.760 --> 1:34:01.720]  So the media is just ridiculous and Trump beautifully trolled them into then wall-to-wall coverage of Islamic terror
[1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:05.320]  But they're also in Europe censoring the Islamic rape brigades
[1:34:06.440 --> 1:34:09.440]  Again gang rape shown on Facebook shocks Sweden
[1:34:10.040 --> 1:34:16.200]  Germany African migrants sexually assaults 18 women on a two-hour train ride just the men just sit there and let them do it you talk about cuckled
[1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:20.640]  Broken back politically correct me and I see somebody
[1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:26.200]  Sexually assaulting women. I am gonna stop. I don't care if you're six foot eight. You are gonna get assaulted
[1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:30.800]  That's not because I'm mr. Badass man. I got daughters. I mean I love women
[1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:36.800]  I'm gonna hurt you bad or die trying people. Oh, listen that much. Oh talk. What the hell are you talking about?
[1:34:37.240 --> 1:34:40.520]  Look what we've done in the info war. Where are the men people said?
[1:34:40.520 --> 1:34:43.000]  Why'd you do all this because they were trying to destroy the country?
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:47.160]  I knew that in the future war was information war. We built the info war
[1:34:47.160 --> 1:34:54.280]  Where are the men I just I don't even know what species this is. I've got stacks of these just today that have come in we've got the reporter
[1:34:55.160 --> 1:34:58.080]  Salihah Farber joining us to document this massive
[1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:00.240]  cover-up and
[1:35:00.240 --> 1:35:05.320]  Then in other news we just got so much incredible stuff here to be breaking down
[1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:10.560]  Drudge comes out and says listen. I don't want to hear that. We're gonna do a bunch of other stuff first
[1:35:10.560 --> 1:35:16.080]  It's tax cuts on the poor in the middle class all the top economists say we're going into a recession slash depression
[1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:20.000]  never got out of the recession if we don't do this fast and
[1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:25.560]  Trump responds within hours saying yes, drudge. I'm going to do it the next three weeks
[1:35:25.960 --> 1:35:29.880]  But meanwhile Paul Ryan and people are running around getting Soros money and that's the big story
[1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:35.280]  He broke on info wars calm in the last few days and and also how there's this big tie-in
[1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:40.760]  That's going on and taking place with Google and and media matters
[1:35:40.760 --> 1:35:48.600]  With this new office set up the State Department Trump's so busy with everything else that that Brock is caught in a document bragging
[1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:53.920]  That they're going to be the group that the government consortium goes to still
[1:35:54.600 --> 1:35:59.840]  along with a mail-ordered group out of Florida that does mail-ordered diplomas and
[1:36:01.200 --> 1:36:03.200]  Snopes a lady her cat and her husband
[1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:09.800]  They will be the grand arbiters of who can have a website and it's begun Wikipedia's ban the Daily Mail that I found to be a
[1:36:09.800 --> 1:36:11.800]  super hardcore paper
[1:36:11.960 --> 1:36:14.880]  And you've you know, you've also got other reports
[1:36:15.520 --> 1:36:19.960]  With massive Twitter censorship increasing so we'll talk about all that the dr. Jerome Corsi
[1:36:19.960 --> 1:36:26.120]  And then I'm going to go to your phone calls with Natasha and others that are patiently holding dr. Jerome Corsi three time
[1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:28.560]  New York Times number one best-seller
[1:36:29.080 --> 1:36:35.440]  investigative journalists but really better known in circles and a friend of Trump or 40 plus years in banking and
[1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:38.880]  They met earlier last year and discussed the future
[1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:44.520]  But the big thing here is they're trying to stall the economy Goldman Sachs is announcing it Bloomberg
[1:36:45.320 --> 1:36:48.520]  They're all saying kill the economy recession hurt Trump
[1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:50.800]  They're trying it hasn't happened yet
[1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:56.400]  But Trump knows he's in a race to turn the economy on so as a Harvard economist and geopolitical scientists
[1:36:56.400 --> 1:36:59.800]  That's really course. He's forte. So before we get into his big stories
[1:36:59.800 --> 1:37:06.200]  He broke about censorship and the rest of it and and and Soros funding the Republican leadership
[1:37:06.200 --> 1:37:09.740]  And and really how Trump is surrounded all he's got to the American people
[1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:13.780]  Let's talk about the attempts to stall the Trump recovery doctor
[1:37:14.360 --> 1:37:21.760]  Well, I've been in Washington all this week as you know Alex and attending meetings and it's clear that on Capitol Hill
[1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:27.080]  The Ryan and and McConnell effort to go along with the Democrats is stall
[1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:34.800]  Donald Trump's program minutes every time I go to a meeting. There's another report about how some committees are saying
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:37.600]  It's gonna take months to repeal Medicare
[1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:45.560]  It's gonna take maybe two years how tax cuts are complicated and if we let the government be run by Ryan and McConnell
[1:37:46.080 --> 1:37:51.560]  It's gonna be completely a Democratic Party agenda of you'll do nothing
[1:37:51.560 --> 1:37:58.280]  But slow down the economy gradually grind it into a recession or depression and you know, thankfully Donald Trump
[1:37:58.280 --> 1:38:03.240]  I don't think it's gonna stand for it. It's just hard to have the the amount of
[1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:08.300]  Subversion that's in Washington of the president's agenda
[1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:14.000]  Every place you turn even within the White House. There are people working against
[1:38:14.760 --> 1:38:20.560]  President Trump and let's be clear. It's like getting a trunning around saying we're not gonna drain the swamp and then Trump makes him go out
[1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:26.040]  To say that's not true. We have Ryan saying we don't we're not gonna have tax cuts till 2018 and then Trump says no
[1:38:26.040 --> 1:38:32.400]  We are they're openly working against him, right? I mean, I'm even suspicious here of rents previous who is you know
[1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:34.400]  The chief of staff he's a Republican
[1:38:35.160 --> 1:38:42.600]  GOP establishment and he's not gonna root out of the State Department, you know the thousand people who have signed this anti-Trump
[1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:47.200]  Letter are saying that they disapprove of his closing
[1:38:48.520 --> 1:38:55.200]  Temporarily immigration from seven states in the Middle East that even Obama identified as terrorist states
[1:38:55.400 --> 1:38:59.840]  They'll say it's really an attack on Islam. It's not it's an attack on
[1:38:59.840 --> 1:39:04.100]  Terrorists coming into the country when these seven renegade states
[1:39:04.100 --> 1:39:09.040]  But you know you see the rents privates and all of the Republican GOP
[1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:18.880]  Even in sconce in the White House and now they're gonna work continuously with David a Brock who are is actively trying to block out
[1:39:20.040 --> 1:39:29.040]  Conservative the libertarian news agencies like Info wars and to keep everything marginalized so that the mainstream media every day can have a
[1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:35.120]  Hate Trump lovefest among themselves in the daily press briefing. That's right
[1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:40.160]  Let's be clear you have the Republican leadership funded by Soros the Soros funded media matters the State Department
[1:39:40.600 --> 1:39:48.320]  Bill that Obama signed two weeks before Trump got in to attack all of Trump's key base and free speech in America
[1:39:48.920 --> 1:39:53.120]  And we can't even get rents previous or anybody to talk about it or Sean Spicer
[1:39:53.120 --> 1:39:59.360]  Right and this it's shocking. You know this this briefing book and you're exactly right that that's what's going on
[1:39:59.800 --> 1:40:04.960]  Within the the White House you've got the Republican establishment working against Trump
[1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:09.040]  And this it's shocking this briefing book from David Brock
[1:40:09.040 --> 1:40:13.600]  Well, I call the father of fake news because the whole term was invented by Brock
[1:40:13.600 --> 1:40:19.520]  And it was invented to work with Google and Facebook and the document just lays it out
[1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:27.160]  You know chapter and verse how news agency that are not ideologically correct are going to be branded
[1:40:27.440 --> 1:40:33.840]  fake news and then the effort is going to be made by the Google and Facebook to
[1:40:35.040 --> 1:40:42.560]  Uncritically remove these websites from any ability to share and the ad revenue to make sure that there's silence
[1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:51.920]  They're considered toxic alt-right. These are the very internet ghettos drudge warned of directly out of Nazi Germany history
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:57.320]  This is literally so an American and thank God this documents leaked. This is them admitting
[1:40:57.320 --> 1:41:01.360]  It's about shutting down free speech and ideology not fake news. It's incredible
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  And the whole term fake news is a mammoth a narrative invented by Brock
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:15.120]  He makes that very clear in this document and his entire goal. He states it openly is to take the air out of any group
[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:18.960]  That would give legitimacy to the Trump administration
[1:41:19.040 --> 1:41:25.880]  So info wars immediately is targeted for slow play in every possible way and you know Donald Trump
[1:41:25.880 --> 1:41:29.000]  I don't think is yet fully aware of the extent to which
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:36.880]  Media matters has dominated Google and Facebook has penetrated working with the mainstream media in the
[1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:44.360]  You know accredited press in the White House at the same people sitting in the front rows always and I think what Donald Trump realizes
[1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:47.480]  That this is a leftist David Brock
[1:41:48.040 --> 1:41:54.840]  Attempt and we see it now in this document documented fully to control the media in anti Trump media
[1:41:54.840 --> 1:42:02.240]  To control it despite Trump being president and to control it from within by controlling the White House press office
[1:42:02.240 --> 1:42:04.880]  And doing everything possible to subvert
[1:42:05.360 --> 1:42:10.400]  Efforts that Donald Trump wants a Trump keeps wondering while the leaks are happening a lot of the Republican leadership
[1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:16.080]  Spicer Ryan all of them are directly plugged in to this Google Brock operation
[1:42:16.600 --> 1:42:20.160]  Right and the the problem is is you try to root it out
[1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:26.360]  You know you look at I mean the State Department is a good example. You have a thousand people resigned great
[1:42:26.560 --> 1:42:31.840]  You got a thousand people who are still employed who are signing anti Trump letters
[1:42:32.200 --> 1:42:36.240]  But they don't want to do their jobs at the State Department. They don't want to support the administration
[1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:39.360]  You know they should get out and Trump should fire them
[1:42:39.360 --> 1:42:44.440]  But again, it's got to Donald Trump's gonna realize and I'm confident he's gonna wake up to it
[1:42:44.440 --> 1:42:47.840]  He always does I've known him for 40 years. He catches on
[1:42:47.840 --> 1:42:54.120]  But you know this the degree of subversion that David Brock and that is hard to left
[1:42:54.840 --> 1:43:00.080]  Inventing fake news and then targeting groups to be excluded
[1:43:00.360 --> 1:43:04.600]  From Facebook. This is truly an un-American anti free speech
[1:43:05.640 --> 1:43:07.640]  authoritarian threat to all of us
[1:43:07.880 --> 1:43:12.360]  yes, it is and and you know it can't be in the heart of the
[1:43:12.360 --> 1:43:17.380]  Trump administration where people are subverting the president's agenda
[1:43:18.440 --> 1:43:22.360]  Restricting access to the president, you know taking away his cell phone
[1:43:22.360 --> 1:43:27.800]  So he can't communicate with anyone who might be supporting him allowing the anti
[1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:33.520]  Trump mainstream media and and Brock makes no doubt about it
[1:43:33.520 --> 1:43:38.320]  He says in this memorandum this memorandum was never intended for the public only for his donors
[1:43:38.320 --> 1:43:44.880]  It says confidential all over it. The goal is to deny the Trump administration legitimacy
[1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:53.280]  Through targeting any news organizations conservative libertarians. This is a fifth column against America against free speech
[1:43:53.280 --> 1:43:57.440]  This is sedition. This isn't free speech. This is organized foreign money
[1:44:00.320 --> 1:44:04.440]  Sorry, your sky's breaking up. This is organized daughter organized foreign money
[1:44:04.440 --> 1:44:11.320]  Trying to openly come in and kill our First Amendment. This is this is a act of sabotage
[1:44:11.320 --> 1:44:16.880]  This is an act of espionage, right? And he's looking for he's got 13 million dollars
[1:44:16.880 --> 1:44:22.880]  He's putting out this proposal for more money, and he's looking for the hard left wherever it comes from in the United States
[1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:29.060]  Outside he doesn't care to fund media matters to do systematic research and put
[1:44:29.060 --> 1:44:35.340]  Websites news agencies media like info wars in the crosshairs of his sites
[1:44:35.740 --> 1:44:37.740]  To say fake news
[1:44:38.380 --> 1:44:43.900]  To smear to pass information around deny credentials
[1:44:44.460 --> 1:44:51.060]  Blockout marginalized any news agency that would dare to support the president's agenda
[1:44:51.180 --> 1:44:58.220]  So the agenda can be totally dominated by media that is Brock approved Google and Facebook
[1:44:58.220 --> 1:45:04.180]  Allowed to get past their censorship and you get past their censorship by being anti-trump
[1:45:04.180 --> 1:45:10.940]  It's as well. Well, Trump is going to learn and is learning about this Trojan horse attack. So good luck Brock and good luck previous
[1:45:13.860 --> 1:45:16.220]  Not of course he let's shift gears as an economist
[1:45:17.180 --> 1:45:22.320]  Into what's happening with I mean you've seen that they're openly confident on Trump is going to realize this
[1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:30.360]  Yeah, what's happening with your skypiss doc is it's massively delayed your you're hearing my audio a lot later
[1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:34.600]  So finish your point with Trump and then let's get into how they're trying to stall the economy go ahead
[1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:40.640]  Yeah
[1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:46.240]  Yes skypes a wonderful thing, but let's reconnect with him real quick
[1:45:46.240 --> 1:45:54.000]  Absolutely, let's play a clip of Maxine waters not knowing what planet. She's on and thinking that Russia has
[1:45:55.040 --> 1:45:57.040]  has a call for in
[1:45:57.600 --> 1:46:03.880]  Yeah, no, I know I know what it is. Thanks. They're telling me stuff. I get it. Thank you, of course Maxine waters has come out
[1:46:04.520 --> 1:46:06.520]  and said that
[1:46:07.200 --> 1:46:09.200]  She believes Russia invaded
[1:46:10.160 --> 1:46:11.920]  Korea and
[1:46:11.920 --> 1:46:13.920]  She also thinks a lot of other things
[1:46:13.920 --> 1:46:17.840]  And now she's calling for the impeachment of Donald Trump here it is
[1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:25.160]  Congressman you have brought up the word impeachment a lot in the past week. You tweeted on Friday, and I know you
[1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:31.320]  This a little bit, but let's talk about the tweet and said your greatest desire was to lead Donald Trump right into impeachment
[1:46:31.320 --> 1:46:34.560]  I think you've since said that he might do it himself
[1:46:34.560 --> 1:46:38.880]  But in response to your statements a White House official told NBC News this morning
[1:46:38.880 --> 1:46:44.880]  I'm quoting here minority leader Pelosi has already dismissed this extreme rhetoric when San Francisco leftist
[1:46:45.360 --> 1:46:51.200]  Representative Nancy Pelosi is the one trying to rein you in you know, you are out of touch between blocking the president's
[1:46:51.720 --> 1:46:53.280]  unquestionably qualified
[1:46:53.280 --> 1:47:01.220]  nominees in the Senate and this new extreme impeachment talk the Democrats have completely lost control and perspective the majority of
[1:47:01.240 --> 1:47:07.200]  Americans are behind the president's efforts to drain the swamp and bring major change to Washington and quote
[1:47:07.200 --> 1:47:13.440]  Congressman, what's your response to that? Well, my response is that they have created a response
[1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:20.080]  That is not credible. This is the most outrageous and ridiculous president that this country has ever had
[1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:24.200]  He cannot be depended on for anything that he says
[1:47:24.640 --> 1:47:32.480]  And so for them to try and pretend that somehow what I'm saying is outrageous and I've been reigned in and all of that
[1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:39.520]  There's no truth to that as a matter of fact all that Nancy Pelosi said was she was not ready yet to talk about
[1:47:39.760 --> 1:47:43.000]  Talk about impeachment. I'm ready to talk about it
[1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:46.200]  You're also ready to say that
[1:47:47.880 --> 1:47:49.880]  Russia invaded Korea
[1:47:50.760 --> 1:47:56.080]  You're also Nancy Pelosi thinks that Bush is still in office sweetheart. That was eight years ago, okay?
[1:47:56.080 --> 1:48:02.480]  And you know that what he's doing with the borders is something that presidents have done. This is Jimmy Carter and
[1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:06.400]  Before but but this bill is from Jimmy Carter's time
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:11.040]  Now I do want to take a few phone calls to Dr. Corsi and I want to ask him
[1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:15.400]  About where he sees the attack on the economy going clearly
[1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:21.160]  I see the drumbeat in the financial papers and from Bloomberg and Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan telling their clients
[1:48:22.040 --> 1:48:24.400]  Get out of the market the market's going down
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:27.840]  We know Soros is bet against the markets, but he's been getting his
[1:48:28.720 --> 1:48:33.600]  Butt handed to him lately. So as a banking executive as an expert in the economy
[1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:39.760]  Dr. Corsi, what is your view now that you're back with us via video skype on their attempts to deep-six the economy?
[1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:44.760]  Well, it's amazing. I mean I again see in the even in the Congress
[1:48:44.760 --> 1:48:49.120]  I mean you're talking about Ryan and McConnell saying oh, no, no, we can't have tax cuts
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:54.720]  We can't cut Medicare. I mean when President Trump understands this like he said today
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:48:58.640]  He's going to demand within 30 days that there's going to be tax cuts
[1:48:59.120 --> 1:49:04.120]  There's nothing to say that you can't take out of you know the the demand in
[1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:10.320]  Medi- in this Obamacare that you either have to have health insurance or pay a tax
[1:49:10.320 --> 1:49:12.560]  I mean there's various provisions in
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:20.200]  Obamacare that can be immediately repealed and then beyond that the broad tax cuts that the president wants to put into place
[1:49:20.200 --> 1:49:24.360]  Which will stimulate the economy are going to be opposed here in Washington
[1:49:24.760 --> 1:49:28.920]  Why and why because all the major communists agree if we don't get big tax cuts
[1:49:28.920 --> 1:49:30.920]  We're going to go into an absolute healthman
[1:49:31.200 --> 1:49:37.160]  Well, the problem is you got somebody invested interest including the GOP establishment and
[1:49:37.960 --> 1:49:41.420]  I'm very suspect of Priebus still being within the White House
[1:49:41.420 --> 1:49:46.900]  He's totally GOP establishment and you know when it comes down to you and picking the ambassadors
[1:49:47.420 --> 1:49:49.260]  Now that we've got
[1:49:49.260 --> 1:49:55.220]  Let's just say it Priebus represents the GOP establishment that's bought and paid for by George Soros. It's a fact
[1:49:55.580 --> 1:49:57.940]  It's a fact. Yeah, I wrote in 2008
[1:49:57.940 --> 1:50:03.340]  I was did the first articles to show that John McCain had been financed by Soros
[1:50:03.420 --> 1:50:09.940]  At least a dozen of them including Ryan and they don't want tax cuts because the truth is there's too many in the GOP
[1:50:09.940 --> 1:50:13.540]  GOP establishment will become wealthy with the
[1:50:14.140 --> 1:50:18.100]  spending programs going right along with Obamacare going right along with the
[1:50:18.660 --> 1:50:24.700]  Democrats and the truth is that you know President Trump's got to realize that the GOP
[1:50:25.060 --> 1:50:32.060]  Establishment including within the State Department within many agencies within the White House itself is not his friends and given the chance
[1:50:32.180 --> 1:50:34.180]  They will subvert his agenda
[1:50:34.180 --> 1:50:41.660]  That's the whole I understand why he brought some of them in because they know how to navigate the system and get people in place and hired but now I
[1:50:42.540 --> 1:50:44.820]  Don't want to attack Spicer's. I'm not sure about him
[1:50:44.820 --> 1:50:49.540]  But Priebus I am but you have all these front row people and it's not that I even want to be in that front row
[1:50:49.580 --> 1:50:53.740]  It's that why would you have all these known enemies that your president's calling fake?
[1:50:53.980 --> 1:51:00.460]  There when you could have more reasonable newspapers or foreign press or a mix of it or even student journalist
[1:51:00.460 --> 1:51:04.780]  Do something different kick out all these old entrenched corrupt
[1:51:05.820 --> 1:51:09.620]  Dinosaurs and then certainly they have to know Obama signed the bill
[1:51:10.100 --> 1:51:15.620]  To federalize communications and take over and start attacking the alt right. I don't care. It was the alt left
[1:51:15.620 --> 1:51:20.060]  You can't shut down press in America, but the CIA over the board of governors of the FCC
[1:51:20.060 --> 1:51:25.820]  I mean this is nightmare stuff that is directed at Trump himself saying you know kick Trump
[1:51:25.820 --> 1:51:30.780]  The same group says kick Trump off Twitter because he's a hate monger. I mean this is incredible
[1:51:31.180 --> 1:51:37.260]  Well, and it's also the gun understands it's it when Trump understands this and I've known him for 40 years
[1:51:37.260 --> 1:51:41.420]  He will make immediate changes. I mean I've seen him look at look at the campaign
[1:51:41.660 --> 1:51:46.580]  When he needed to change campaign managers and bring in Manafort in order to manage delegates
[1:51:46.580 --> 1:51:51.980]  He did so when he needed a campaign manager that could really guide the campaign
[1:51:51.980 --> 1:51:56.180]  Kellyanne Conway came on and did a brilliant job. These are Trump people
[1:51:56.300 --> 1:52:01.980]  There are a lot of Trump people around willing to play a role in the administration and in the media now
[1:52:01.980 --> 1:52:06.940]  Donald Trump realizes that though the mainstream media is shutting out those of us who would help
[1:52:07.300 --> 1:52:11.100]  Trump when he realizes that the departments are still packed with
[1:52:11.660 --> 1:52:14.300]  John Kerry and Barack Obama supporters
[1:52:14.500 --> 1:52:20.900]  There's gonna be a massive firing of the out of the bureaucracy and we did a bigger press room in the White House
[1:52:20.900 --> 1:52:26.100]  We need more access for the internet reporters and bloggers who truly support Donald Trump
[1:52:26.300 --> 1:52:32.700]  Donald Trump wants to turn the press narrative around. He's gonna get these mains right and he's that's all being blocked by
[1:52:33.420 --> 1:52:37.660]  Spicer under orders of previous and I know for a fact from multiple sources
[1:52:38.620 --> 1:52:45.380]  Previces going in with anybody Trump wanted and brought in that he's known and saying the president's fired you and the person
[1:52:45.380 --> 1:52:51.340]  Is only here from the president and they and then a day later spice it goes. Let's be friends. Let's be friends classic tactics
[1:52:51.740 --> 1:52:53.660]  That's that that that
[1:52:53.660 --> 1:52:56.740]  Rents previous is engaged in I mean just look at the guy
[1:52:56.740 --> 1:53:01.420]  He looks like a weasel out of central casting but then look at his pedigree
[1:53:01.460 --> 1:53:08.140]  He is the worst of the worst that tried to steal the nomination from Trump and said our votes didn't count as citizens
[1:53:08.140 --> 1:53:09.620]  I mean this is crazy
[1:53:09.620 --> 1:53:14.860]  So Trump is delivering on his promises so far, you know day 18 or 19. I love him
[1:53:14.860 --> 1:53:19.580]  It's amazing. The problem is you can see him being opposed in real time by his own people
[1:53:20.180 --> 1:53:24.260]  Well, Trump Trump wants to move and I think appropriately at warped speed
[1:53:24.260 --> 1:53:29.500]  He sees the need and he wants as a CEO to correct it and every time he turns around
[1:53:29.500 --> 1:53:33.420]  He's got previous and Ryan and McConnell the Republican
[1:53:33.860 --> 1:53:37.620]  GOP establishment saying oh, no, no, you can't do that. You can't move so fast
[1:53:37.700 --> 1:53:42.100]  We have to consider no, he doesn't have to consider and then they leak. Oh the president admits
[1:53:42.100 --> 1:53:45.100]  He's wrong. He's not gonna move fast the next day goes. I didn't say that we're moving fast
[1:53:45.100 --> 1:53:49.220]  They keep again just like in rich saying all the president told me it's all a lie
[1:53:49.300 --> 1:53:52.900]  He's not gonna run the swamp and the president said you're a liar go tell people that's a lie
[1:53:53.060 --> 1:53:56.420]  He had to go say he was lying. They're really trying to undermine him
[1:53:57.180 --> 1:54:00.780]  Exactly as the president wants to and he would want to change the narrative in this country
[1:54:01.020 --> 1:54:05.300]  Get rid of the mainstream media still sitting in the front row of the press office
[1:54:05.700 --> 1:54:10.860]  Every time he comes in asking got your questions and determined to write negative stories
[1:54:10.860 --> 1:54:18.500]  You want to change the narrative in America? Change the press room a bigger press room open to a more diverse press and get this
[1:54:18.500 --> 1:54:20.500]  David Brock and his other
[1:54:20.420 --> 1:54:23.420]  Criminal leftists who want to destroy this country with censorship
[1:54:23.900 --> 1:54:28.460]  Exposed along with Google and face absolutely, and I want to add a couple points. I'm gonna go some phone calls
[1:54:29.300 --> 1:54:31.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you
[1:54:32.700 --> 1:54:33.700]  That
[1:54:33.700 --> 1:54:37.660]  Rinse previous is on about half an inch thick ice and the Sun just came out
[1:54:37.660 --> 1:54:45.660]  So rinse previous I can just enjoy himself all he wants and play his little sabotage games and sit there and kiss Trump's butt
[1:54:45.860 --> 1:54:48.020]  Trump sees right through you just like he did
[1:54:48.940 --> 1:54:53.980]  Whenever he met at you know the Trump Tower with Romney and Romney is not a weasel compared to previous
[1:54:53.980 --> 1:54:55.980]  I'll just say that but it has his problems
[1:54:56.020 --> 1:54:59.940]  Yeah, and as you know tried to sell off the GOP establishment. They betrayed him as well
[1:55:00.140 --> 1:55:03.980]  But I mean I told you weeks before he's not going to be chosen
[1:55:03.980 --> 1:55:09.500]  For Secretary of State, and I told you that and let me tell you Trump knows what's going on now
[1:55:09.500 --> 1:55:12.340]  I run a pretty good-sized company of 60 something people. I
[1:55:12.900 --> 1:55:16.380]  Have issues sometimes with not knowing what folks are up to and finding out what's happening
[1:55:16.380 --> 1:55:22.100]  So imagine President Trump with 4,000 people under him and all the subterfuge and everything else in his workload
[1:55:22.220 --> 1:55:27.700]  I'm giving him an A-plus because I mean he has done amazing things but understand this
[1:55:27.700 --> 1:55:34.380]  He needs us to be watch dogs. Justice Stephen Bannon has come out and said listen keep us on us watch what we're doing
[1:55:34.660 --> 1:55:40.820]  Because we can't watch every angle. This is crazy now briefly before I go to some phone calls with our guest here
[1:55:40.820 --> 1:55:42.260]  I want people to know that
[1:55:42.260 --> 1:55:46.780]  my father is a recently retired dentist an oral surgeon and he working with the biggest

[1:56:09.260 --> 1:56:12.540]  My people don't want that people just buy the regular, you know organic stuff
[1:56:12.540 --> 1:56:15.300]  They don't need it to get it from us, but boy, he was right

[1:57:01.980 --> 1:57:08.740]  Let's go to Natasha for dr. Corsi in this segment the next Natasha. Thanks for holding from Tennessee. You're on the air go ahead
[1:57:08.740 --> 1:57:13.460]  Hi Alex nice to speak to you for the first time
[1:57:14.380 --> 1:57:19.660]  I'm an avid listener of yours. I do a lot of research in every aspect
[1:57:19.900 --> 1:57:27.180]  And I've realized that truly what you said about, you know the state of the country, you know has actually become
[1:57:28.260 --> 1:57:29.860]  extremely
[1:57:29.860 --> 1:57:35.140]  Actually extremely in jeopardy for people like us who are truly fighting
[1:57:35.140 --> 1:57:41.580]  To be able to actually educate people on what's actually happening in the world because many people are just so
[1:57:43.180 --> 1:57:46.100]  Brainwashed by the fact that they think
[1:57:46.740 --> 1:57:52.620]  What the mainstream media tells them is actually true and it's not in most aspects
[1:57:52.620 --> 1:57:56.260]  It's nothing but lies and that's become a huge problem
[1:57:57.020 --> 1:57:59.020]  Because people actually believe it
[1:58:00.060 --> 1:58:03.340]  Well, that's right some of us are awake and know what's going on out that we're perfect
[1:58:03.340 --> 1:58:10.580]  Other people just believe whatever they're told and believe that openly talking about killing Trump's a good thing and mainstream media is promoting killing Trump
[1:58:10.580 --> 1:58:12.580]  Where do you think this is all going dr. Corsi?
[1:58:13.260 --> 1:58:16.380]  Well, I think that basically the support of
[1:58:16.780 --> 1:58:23.140]  In the country for Donald Trump has never been higher and I think the people are seeing the Donald Trump is doing a magnificent job and
[1:58:23.780 --> 1:58:29.460]  Alex, I think he's gonna he was on your show. I believe three times in the campaign you eat listens to you
[1:58:29.460 --> 1:58:33.100]  Uh, we can see he's responded very quickly
[1:58:34.380 --> 1:58:39.940]  Immediately he'll respond as well to you and I think the whole well, we'll stay right there
[1:58:39.940 --> 1:58:45.220]  That's right the people have to keep pressing keep reaching out on Twitter to Trump letting him know what's going on
[1:58:45.220 --> 1:58:47.720]  He listens to you folks. He listens to you
[1:58:48.460 --> 1:58:50.460]  We'll be right back
[1:58:50.460 --> 1:58:51.260]  We're right back
[1:58:51.260 --> 1:58:58.340]  We have a priest in New Jersey who is starting to sound like one of us father Peter West a Catholic priest in the Archdiocese of Newark is an
[1:58:58.340 --> 1:59:00.620]  Abid Trump supporter and not afraid to show it
[1:59:00.620 --> 1:59:05.300]  This is a priest who posts on social media daily taking on such topics as radical Islam
[1:59:05.420 --> 1:59:12.300]  Millennial safe spaces and modern-day liberals now father West has fallen under scrutiny from some of his colleagues who believe he is acting
[1:59:12.660 --> 1:59:17.220]  inappropriately and has gone too far in 2004 a former st. Louis archbishop
[1:59:17.220 --> 1:59:23.680]  Cardinal Raymond Burke took a hard political stance when he refused to allow the at the time senator John Kerry to receive
[1:59:23.680 --> 1:59:31.080]  Communion for his pro-choice views now Burke is an Abid Trump supporter who has spoken out against radical Islam and was demoted in
[1:59:31.720 --> 1:59:39.400]  2014 by Pope Francis from the head of the Vatican's highest court to a ceremonial position because of his public disagreements with Pope Francis
[1:59:39.400 --> 1:59:46.360]  It's not surprising that father West is gaining national attention and support because going against political correctness is growing in popularity
[1:59:46.360 --> 1:59:56.320]  This is Owen Troyer for info wars comm so not PC. You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:59:56.320 --> 2:00:04.760]  From the front lines of the information war
[2:00:06.320 --> 2:00:12.960]  It's Alex Jones. All right coming up the next segment of my friendship with Mark star Jake Kevin and others Dr. Corsi's leaving us here in about five minutes
[2:00:13.280 --> 2:00:15.280]  Take a call from Todd here in a moment
[2:00:15.680 --> 2:00:18.680]  I think we're going to have a little bit of time before we get to the next segment of the show
[2:00:18.680 --> 2:00:21.680]  I think we're going to have a little bit of time before we get to the next segment of the show
[2:00:21.680 --> 2:00:26.600]  Kevin and others Dr. Corsi's leaving us here in about five minutes to take a call from Todd here in a moment Todd
[2:00:26.600 --> 2:00:28.600]  You're on the air from Texas welcome
[2:00:29.280 --> 2:00:32.360]  It's so awesome to talk to you Alex. Let's talk to you. Go ahead
[2:00:33.200 --> 2:00:35.600]  All right, you and mr. Corsi both
[2:00:36.400 --> 2:00:43.920]  I'm kind of curious why Trump hasn't addressed Obama putting CIA over the board of governors in that last NDA
[2:00:43.920 --> 2:00:45.280]  Well, that's what we're hammering
[2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:50.800]  Well, I mean Trump has a lot of big things like tax cuts and securing the border and battling the media and all the rest of it
[2:00:50.800 --> 2:00:53.360]  But you mean you would think this would all just get shut down
[2:00:53.360 --> 2:01:01.040]  But that in DAA that that that system to take over the media is still in place and Brock and Google and the Republicans are now
[2:01:01.040 --> 2:01:04.440]  Still contending the agenda. That's exactly what we were just saying Todd
[2:01:05.760 --> 2:01:10.960]  Right, that's uh, I want to bring it up to you. I know you're not per se in his ear
[2:01:10.960 --> 2:01:17.640]  But you're in his ear and you know, like you said, we need to keep hammering it because if it goes like it is we're gonna be extinct
[2:01:17.640 --> 2:01:20.760]  Well, here's the deal and I'll say this right now. There's a lot of stuff
[2:01:20.760 --> 2:01:25.660]  I want to get done around this office and I'm great crew, but it's one thing to talk about. It's hard to get stuff done
[2:01:26.160 --> 2:01:28.160]  and he's got to pick his battles, but
[2:01:28.840 --> 2:01:33.560]  He is going up against the media discrediting it. He's a very sophisticated person, but I think the fact that
[2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:39.000]  The Republicans themselves are working with Brock and Google to undermine him
[2:01:39.280 --> 2:01:40.920]  He's learning about that right now
[2:01:40.920 --> 2:01:43.960]  I'm gonna leave it there because I haven't talked to him in a while like three weeks
[2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:49.240]  But I can tell you this a little birds have told me not just Roger Stone, but little birds that Trump is now
[2:01:49.840 --> 2:01:51.680]  figuring it out a
[2:01:51.680 --> 2:01:57.640]  Lot of other things are going on and I want to give it away, but he's investigating right now dr. Corsi. I
[2:01:58.440 --> 2:02:00.440]  grew the entirely
[2:02:00.800 --> 2:02:07.640]  Trump's a brilliant manager and he will listen. He's listened to you Alex. He listens to readers
[2:02:07.640 --> 2:02:11.920]  He he's very active on the internet. He spends his evenings. He's listening
[2:02:11.920 --> 2:02:19.280]  Uh, he's getting great appointments in place. I was very very thrilled to see our senator Jeff Sessions
[2:02:19.560 --> 2:02:23.600]  Confirmed this morning as attorney general. That's a major major step
[2:02:23.880 --> 2:02:29.440]  But Trump has got to realize how much subversion from within within the media within the White House
[2:02:29.680 --> 2:02:37.680]  This GOP Republican establishment cannot be trusted those slowest agenda at every moment. I see this in DC
[2:02:37.680 --> 2:02:43.840]  I'm here have been all week. That's right. He can't bring them in and share power. They're gonna be sabotaging him at the entire time
[2:02:44.280 --> 2:02:52.120]  That's right, and it's gonna take Trump's awareness of it. Now once he fully catches on I can assure you the Donald Trump will clean house
[2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:57.320]  And the same indications. I think you're hearing I'm hearing too there will be changes coming
[2:02:57.360 --> 2:03:02.600]  Talk about what you're hearing in DC. I know you know all the heavy hitters. What's the word? Well, the word is just what you were saying
[2:03:02.600 --> 2:03:09.280]  I mean that you know that the previous is actually trying to get rid of some of the Trump loyalists who've gone to Trump and Trump said
[2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:11.280]  What do you mean? You're leaving and what do you mean?
[2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:16.200]  I said I want you to stay and then they may point out that previous has been trying to get rid of them
[2:03:16.200 --> 2:03:20.560]  And we can name some names, but I'd like to keep it. Let's not do it. Yeah, let's not do it
[2:03:20.560 --> 2:03:25.640]  I can tell you you're a hundred percent right on what you just reported and my confidence is
[2:03:26.160 --> 2:03:30.400]  Donald Trump will listen. He's gonna make substantial changes
[2:03:30.400 --> 2:03:37.160]  But he's gonna have to understand and he's coming to understand that he's got forces from within the Republican GOP
[2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:40.800]  Even within the White House today certainly within the press corps by the way
[2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:47.240]  I've been like eight six seven years ago on the phone with you on Skype during a break. You know, I gotta go
[2:03:47.240 --> 2:03:51.000]  It's Donald Trump and I've talked to folks somebody's come in your office. You can let them in go ahead
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:55.920]  I mean the point is is that you know, you Trump will get a hold of you soon. We'll figure all this stuff out
[2:03:55.920 --> 2:04:01.880]  It's have them come on in. It's no big deal. This is live sky people love it, but this is quite a time to be alive right now
[2:04:01.880 --> 2:04:04.960]  Dr. Corsi we only got 60 seconds left any other points
[2:04:05.320 --> 2:04:07.680]  Well, I think my major point is that we get it
[2:04:07.680 --> 2:04:12.840]  I love to tell listeners just continue to be on Twitter continue to follow

[2:04:29.840 --> 2:04:31.320]  He's the father of fake news
[2:04:31.320 --> 2:04:36.440]  He's at the heart with Google and Google's not to be trusted Facebook's not to be trusted
[2:04:36.440 --> 2:04:43.320]  They're both solidly anti-Trump and we're gonna expose this and continue exposing it until we can open up this press rule
[2:04:43.320 --> 2:04:47.760]  All right, how do folks contact you? They want to give you news tips. We need to give you an info or his email soon

[2:08:10.860 --> 2:08:16.140]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[2:08:16.140 --> 2:08:26.740]  There's an article up on info wars calm that everybody should go see shock photo human breast milk destroys deadly bacteria
[2:08:27.540 --> 2:08:31.180]  Whoever knew it was an incredible disinfected an antibacterial
[2:08:32.340 --> 2:08:36.020]  But as a conspiracy theory that babies have ever even needed it
[2:08:37.260 --> 2:08:40.060]  That's an example of why they didn't in the industrialized society
[2:08:40.060 --> 2:08:45.020]  They said we need women in factories not breastfeeding their babies and then the brains are smaller
[2:08:45.020 --> 2:08:49.620]  The public is stupid and it gives rise to the zombie population
[2:08:50.700 --> 2:08:56.460]  You can go see in a Petri dish what breast milk does the bacteria versus other substances it
[2:08:56.820 --> 2:08:58.420]  annihilates it
[2:08:58.420 --> 2:09:03.460]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, it's a conspiracy theory that women ever breastfed their children
[2:09:04.620 --> 2:09:08.300]  That's where we're going. I even saw the cover of a
[2:09:08.300 --> 2:09:14.540]  A parent magazine about our art. Are we doing too many cesareans? Oh, no
[2:09:15.020 --> 2:09:19.780]  Again, it's all about taking control of the entire human environment. I
[2:09:20.340 --> 2:09:23.140]  Want to go to your phone calls, but also one of the few clips before we do that
[2:09:24.100 --> 2:09:27.980]  So we have Bill Crystal. I played earlier saying white working class be replaced by immigrants
[2:09:28.140 --> 2:09:33.220]  We have Sally Brown famously saying that she were running for the DNC
[2:09:33.220 --> 2:09:38.860]  Is how the party that she will suppress white people know she's white. It'll be her job to make sure they don't get privilege and that the
[2:09:39.620 --> 2:09:43.900]  People of color get privilege. I mean, this is just role reversals of racism
[2:09:45.100 --> 2:09:47.100]  There's a bigger report than that ties into
[2:09:47.980 --> 2:09:53.480]  All of this by John Bown and then dear white people a new Netflix show. It's kind of like the MTV shows
[2:09:54.380 --> 2:09:58.500]  That you know teaches you how it's bad that you're white. I mean, this is the craziest thing
[2:09:58.500 --> 2:10:05.620]  I'm sorry 7% of the world doesn't have a lot of pigment and skin and lived up in the frozen north
[2:10:05.620 --> 2:10:07.620]  And so had to develop some science and technology
[2:10:08.700 --> 2:10:16.660]  And maybe you can argue science and technology has been bad, but it's it's like this arrogance and this this this hatred of white people
[2:10:16.980 --> 2:10:18.980]  That the corporations are selling
[2:10:20.580 --> 2:10:22.580]  This isn't coming from
[2:10:22.580 --> 2:10:28.620]  Quote minorities and then it just reinvokes like 1940s or 30s
[2:10:29.180 --> 2:10:32.180]  Supposed racism that even went on the only one on sporadically and
[2:10:32.780 --> 2:10:39.780]  Reinvokes it shows black people breaking things and throwing things down and revolting against the enemy. I mean, this is so scientific
[2:10:42.780 --> 2:10:48.340]  And it's disgusting and people are tired of it and it's meant to make white people racist
[2:10:48.340 --> 2:10:53.900]  Let's let's let's give you the big news flash. It's not just meant to make black people in hispanics anti-white
[2:10:53.900 --> 2:10:56.700]  It's meant to make whites be racist as well than the whole
[2:10:57.540 --> 2:11:00.180]  Balkanization plan works just just perfectly
[2:11:02.660 --> 2:11:07.220]  Continuing Amazon's new robot run supermarket will phase out human employees
[2:11:07.740 --> 2:11:13.380]  But you know what so what about a world being built that's anti-human. Let's all just fight with each other over what color we are
[2:11:14.300 --> 2:11:16.300]  No scientific basis for airport
[2:11:16.300 --> 2:11:23.140]  Behavior screening TSA internal file show. It's just made up and I'm not bashing with TSA themselves
[2:11:23.140 --> 2:11:27.420]  But they've got an unconstitutional job. You're supposed to control the external borders and
[2:11:28.100 --> 2:11:33.500]  Vet people and then leave people alone inside the country besides who does all the terror attacks Muslims
[2:11:33.620 --> 2:11:38.140]  You're not supposed to say that see that because your reality is politically incorrect
[2:11:39.980 --> 2:11:43.540]  Meanwhile the military is training for martial law here in the United States
[2:11:43.540 --> 2:11:47.880]  Micro-aggression and safe space have now been added to the Marion Webster dictionary
[2:11:48.180 --> 2:11:52.340]  How about adults or how about brainwasher? How about crippled public?
[2:11:52.340 --> 2:11:58.940]  How about public put under mind control and coming up in the next hour the number one mind control program at US colleges?
[2:11:58.940 --> 2:12:04.500]  They unspoken secret in plain sight if you're a college student or have children at college read this
[2:12:05.500 --> 2:12:09.100]  powerful report by John Rappaport on info wars.com
[2:12:09.100 --> 2:12:14.020]  In fact, will you guys retweet that for me at real Alex Jones to say the secret of modern education?
[2:12:15.580 --> 2:12:21.820]  The secret concerning modern education, they don't want you to know that should be the real headline. It is powerful
[2:12:23.220 --> 2:12:24.540]  powerful
[2:12:24.540 --> 2:12:26.540]  information but speaking of clips
[2:12:26.940 --> 2:12:29.900]  Let's go ahead and go to this next little clip here
[2:12:30.620 --> 2:12:32.620]  We've got Coretta Scott King
[2:12:33.380 --> 2:12:35.900]  Thanks, Jeff Sessions for Rosa Parks Library
[2:12:35.900 --> 2:12:38.580]  But don't expect that you're gonna see that
[2:12:39.260 --> 2:12:46.900]  That's the daughter of Martin Luther King, right? Don't she been on the show before don't dinner needs to don't think you're gonna hear about this in the news
[2:12:47.140 --> 2:12:49.140]  and we've got US
[2:12:50.300 --> 2:12:53.820]  Martial Defense AG nominee Jeff Sessions and we also have
[2:12:55.980 --> 2:13:00.340]  Black senator being demonized and call those sorts of racist names as well
[2:13:00.340 --> 2:13:01.900]  We're gonna get to all that than your phone calls
[2:13:01.900 --> 2:13:08.740]  But let's go to US Martial Defense AG nominee Jeff Sessions. Here's that clip before he was
[2:13:09.700 --> 2:13:11.700]  Finally confirmed yesterday. I
[2:13:12.820 --> 2:13:14.820]  Known Jeff Sessions for 20 years
[2:13:15.340 --> 2:13:22.500]  He's a good and decent man. He believes in law and order for all the people all the people in Alabama
[2:13:23.500 --> 2:13:30.820]  Because of his colleagues and all surrounded him the things that he's done for the law enforcement community and the citizen of Alabama
[2:13:30.820 --> 2:13:39.620]  It's great. It's without any questions as to whether or not he would be fit to serve this country as the United States Attorney General
[2:13:40.180 --> 2:13:44.300]  Now I did not learn these things from a political press conference
[2:13:44.980 --> 2:13:46.500]  any
[2:13:46.500 --> 2:13:47.900]  Website while I read about him
[2:13:47.900 --> 2:13:53.940]  I know Jeff Sessions as the man the man that I know it's a decent and honest and respectful man
[2:13:54.340 --> 2:13:57.820]  That would put all of his life into public service
[2:13:57.820 --> 2:14:03.260]  I've done that when we talk about this criminal justice system
[2:14:04.420 --> 2:14:12.060]  We enforce the laws and we do it because we have a love for the laws Jeff Sessions love
[2:14:12.860 --> 2:14:15.660]  The people that do the enforcement side of it
[2:14:15.660 --> 2:14:21.260]  He respects the citizen deserve a good and honest person that's going to give all he has
[2:14:21.620 --> 2:14:26.900]  To make sure that everyone is treated equally and fairly as the law as it under the law
[2:14:26.900 --> 2:14:31.260]  But his decency as a man and his honesty as a man
[2:14:32.060 --> 2:14:33.660]  Speak for itself
[2:14:33.660 --> 2:14:38.380]  He's the type of individual that I support for the United States Attorney General's office
[2:14:38.700 --> 2:14:45.620]  Because of my reputation and his history with me as a person and the things that I've seen over the years in Jeff Sessions
[2:14:45.660 --> 2:14:49.780]  It's hard being a public servant. I was in law and been in law enforcement for 40 years
[2:14:50.860 --> 2:14:52.860]  It's a tough job
[2:14:52.860 --> 2:14:58.620]  We don't violate the laws. We don't get out there and do things that would cause ourselves to be
[2:14:59.140 --> 2:15:02.740]  Brought into the system and I'm not saying everybody is the same
[2:15:03.380 --> 2:15:09.340]  But I believe that he'll he'll take hold of the justice system justice department and he'll be fair
[2:15:09.420 --> 2:15:13.180]  He will be honest and he'll do the same thing for every person
[2:15:14.100 --> 2:15:16.540]  With honesty and respect for all of us
[2:15:16.540 --> 2:15:23.100]  And and by the way, I'm teleprompter free so I make mistakes sometimes I can't keep track all this
[2:15:23.100 --> 2:15:30.020]  I know that Martin Luther King's daughter has come out in support of Trump. I know his niece has I've had both of them on over the years
[2:15:30.580 --> 2:15:32.580]  And that's his widow
[2:15:32.940 --> 2:15:37.580]  The fact I'm after I said I said that's that's not right. Who is that? Yeah, that's his wife widow
[2:15:38.300 --> 2:15:40.580]  so Martin Luther King's
[2:15:40.580 --> 2:15:47.300]  Widow has come out in support of sessions and they're calling a KKK member and also they're made up crap because they know him in Alabama
[2:15:47.540 --> 2:15:53.740]  They know it's not true. So here's Coretta Scott King. Thanks Jeff sessions for Rosa Parks Library. Here it is
[2:15:56.100 --> 2:15:58.100]  The president Martindale
[2:15:58.980 --> 2:16:00.980]  to
[2:16:03.980 --> 2:16:05.980]  Son of two sessions
[2:16:05.980 --> 2:16:07.980]  Sessions
[2:16:09.500 --> 2:16:11.500]  The mayor bright
[2:16:11.580 --> 2:16:16.740]  Troy State Chancellor Jack Hawkins, Jr. Dr. Dorothy height

[2:16:27.820 --> 2:16:29.300]  participants and
[2:16:29.300 --> 2:16:31.740]  guests in this audience today
[2:16:31.740 --> 2:16:42.100]  It's a great honor and privilege for me to join you in celebrating the grand opening of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum
[2:16:44.100 --> 2:16:46.100]  History teaches us
[2:16:46.460 --> 2:16:51.820]  That all great freedom movements began with an inspiring act of coverage
[2:16:52.700 --> 2:16:58.020]  And in disregard the American Civil Rights Movement provides a supreme example
[2:16:58.020 --> 2:17:04.980]  The library and museum we dedicate today is a living testament
[2:17:05.380 --> 2:17:07.620]  to the courage commitment and
[2:17:08.540 --> 2:17:09.900]  character of
[2:17:09.900 --> 2:17:14.580]  The great woman whose act of courage sparked our freedom struggle
[2:17:15.500 --> 2:17:19.100]  The woman we call Mrs. Rosa Louise Parks
[2:17:20.060 --> 2:17:23.820]  All right, and credit Scott King the late widow of Martin Luther King died in
[2:17:23.820 --> 2:17:28.100]  2006 so there she is from the grave thinking Jeff Sessions
[2:17:31.340 --> 2:17:35.580]  We're gonna break them back with a phone calls from Jake first in Washington and
[2:17:36.620 --> 2:17:41.540]  Then star and then mark and then Kevin and Evan and then we have a guest joining us from Europe
[2:17:41.580 --> 2:17:45.220]  And if that's you get a journalist into why do the Muslims rape women so much?
[2:17:45.220 --> 2:17:51.500]  I mean one guy just reportedly sexually attacked 18 women on a train for two hours as the men
[2:17:51.500 --> 2:17:57.940]  Cuckold you only let the government, you know defend laid there and took it
[2:17:59.220 --> 2:18:04.140]  Just crazy to see people just roll over to tyranny before I go any further
[2:18:05.220 --> 2:18:07.820]  We have undoubted with the very best toothpaste in the world
[2:18:07.820 --> 2:18:14.140]  No one's thought to put colloidal silver and iodine in it along with the peppermint oil and tea tree oil and other things
[2:18:14.300 --> 2:18:19.900]  This is the national best-selling fluoride free toothpaste private label by us, but at the major factory
[2:18:19.900 --> 2:18:24.900]  Having these ingredients added it took my dad over a year to get this done
[2:18:24.900 --> 2:18:27.180]  This is the second batch people really love it
[2:18:27.180 --> 2:18:33.380]  We have bubblegum flavor coming soon that doesn't have the peppermint and a tea tree oil in it because that's a little strong for kids
[2:18:33.380 --> 2:18:41.140]  Sometimes, but this is really a great adult toothpaste and your purchase of it. It's 995 funds our operation and what we do here

[2:24:27.300 --> 2:24:35.220]  Your existing neighborhoods and put you under a neighborhood association zoning with local block captains that control you inspect your house

[2:24:38.740 --> 2:24:44.180]  It's designed to end single-family dwellings. It's hellish. So I saw an article on affordable Austin
[2:24:44.180 --> 2:24:50.020]  That broke down how it was like a Stephen King nightmare novel and so I gave it a bunch of attention
[2:24:50.620 --> 2:24:55.620]  But I said this is accurate and I said this is a worldwide plan Austin is a test city
[2:24:56.340 --> 2:24:58.660]  this person knew this three years ago and
[2:25:00.380 --> 2:25:05.060]  There's a article up on Facebook with a video that Rob do did a code code next
[2:25:05.740 --> 2:25:08.100]  That is again on Facebook right now
[2:25:08.100 --> 2:25:13.820]  So I tell the person hey, we'd like you know to have you on as a guest and they say well
[2:25:13.820 --> 2:25:18.620]  I don't really agree with your subject matter, but but but maybe let me let me explain something
[2:25:18.620 --> 2:25:22.980]  I'm not saying that to you at your affordable Austin website
[2:25:24.100 --> 2:25:29.180]  Because I need you on the show. I've got too much news to cover. I'm saying it because
[2:25:30.180 --> 2:25:34.500]  Leftist will never talk to anybody you agree. This is a big screw job
[2:25:34.500 --> 2:25:41.780]  I'm trying to help you recruit a bunch of Austinites to beat it the test city of the raping you write about and
[2:25:42.900 --> 2:25:45.940]  Then you don't want to come on because you don't agree with the show
[2:25:46.860 --> 2:25:53.460]  That'd be like saying you wouldn't go on Fox News. You disagree with them. It's called publicity. It's called talking to each other
[2:25:55.860 --> 2:26:01.540]  But it's especially the left they will not talk to anybody they don't agree with even though you do agree with us
[2:26:01.540 --> 2:26:03.540]  It's it's just crazy
[2:26:04.980 --> 2:26:06.980]  It's absolutely totally
[2:26:08.140 --> 2:26:11.620]  Insane they're telling people at yoga studios all over Austin
[2:26:11.780 --> 2:26:16.980]  This has been on the news after we talked about it last year don't ever wear Indian style jewelry or dress
[2:26:16.980 --> 2:26:22.420]  It's cultural appropriation. It upsets Indians. No Indians are even upset. Does it matter? It's a free country
[2:26:22.420 --> 2:26:27.540]  It's like somebody saying somebody in India can't wear blue jeans because it's what cowboys developed, you know in the West
[2:26:27.540 --> 2:26:32.540]  It's it's crazy or
[2:26:32.820 --> 2:26:36.740]  About like a Hawaiian, you know fish hook necklace from Maui around my neck
[2:26:36.740 --> 2:26:40.900]  I shouldn't wear it because I'm on a Hawaiian. It's it's it's cult level racism garbage
[2:26:42.100 --> 2:26:44.100]  And it goes further with tribalism
[2:26:45.380 --> 2:26:48.180]  Or hey, here we are one of the biggest shows in the world
[2:26:48.420 --> 2:26:50.420]  We're showing your article this person really gets it
[2:26:50.580 --> 2:26:56.580]  Hey, why don't you come on and talk about your experience with this whole global corporate zoning tyranny that ends private property rights
[2:26:56.580 --> 2:27:02.340]  Oh, I I better not see because you're afraid what might happen to you. You might get criticized
[2:27:03.060 --> 2:27:08.740]  You want to be criticized by the establishment? You want to stand up for what you believe in it?
[2:27:08.740 --> 2:27:11.220]  It's like a nation of jellyfish
[2:27:12.260 --> 2:27:16.020]  And what will a nation of sheep be ruled by wolves?
[2:27:16.740 --> 2:27:18.020]  wolves
[2:27:18.020 --> 2:27:20.020]  whoof very
[2:27:20.020 --> 2:27:21.140]  frustrating and
[2:27:21.140 --> 2:27:27.380]  And you just run into it and it's just the tibidness that the the testosterone levels almost gone the sperm counts almost gone
[2:27:27.540 --> 2:27:29.540]  We're dead already
[2:27:29.540 --> 2:27:32.500]  And those of us that still exhibit any male traits really are
[2:27:33.780 --> 2:27:35.780]  We're the bad ones
[2:27:35.860 --> 2:27:39.380]  We know men and women got the species here, but it's just for them. It's all over
[2:27:40.420 --> 2:27:42.420]  I get it
[2:27:42.820 --> 2:27:48.660]  But but you know something's a zoning scam by the big rent sinkers to screw you over and put you in a cult
[2:27:48.660 --> 2:27:52.820]  But you won't fight it and you won't fight with other people that understand it
[2:27:54.500 --> 2:27:59.860]  Doesn't matter though. I will educate people by your ignorance. See you will not stop me and there are people that want the truth
[2:28:02.580 --> 2:28:06.420]  Unbelievable jake in washington you're on the air. Thanks for holding
[2:28:07.780 --> 2:28:09.300]  Hey, how's it going?
[2:28:09.300 --> 2:28:14.660]  You know a lot of good stuff's happening. Trump is over delivering, but he's just surrounded by traders. It's really sad
[2:28:14.660 --> 2:28:20.420]  Yeah, it is. First off. I want to thank you. Uh, I've been listening for the last two years and uh,
[2:28:20.660 --> 2:28:26.100]  You've given me a lot of education at the schools. Obviously aren't going to give us, you know, um
[2:28:26.660 --> 2:28:30.420]  I'm a young patriot out here, you know in washington state and that's hard, you know
[2:28:30.580 --> 2:28:33.700]  And you know, I actually just turned 21 today
[2:28:34.260 --> 2:28:39.620]  And uh, I was trying to think what I could do to try to you know, uh express my views on how I feel
[2:28:39.940 --> 2:28:42.020]  So, you know, I started a little youtube channel
[2:28:42.020 --> 2:28:49.620]  I uh got a little twitter account and you know, basically the thing I'm calling in about is I don't understand how the so-called judge
[2:28:50.340 --> 2:28:55.860]  Can basically tell the department of security. Hey, you can't do your job. I mean
[2:28:56.500 --> 2:29:02.180]  Because there's judiciary as well as bureaucratic open sedition and rebellion. The law is crystal clear
[2:29:02.500 --> 2:29:05.220]  A lobotomized moron could understand it literally
[2:29:05.860 --> 2:29:09.940]  And uh, they're just acting like the president just did something bad. Oh, look, he was breathing
[2:29:09.940 --> 2:29:13.380]  Oh at 2 a.m. He was seen in a bathrobe outside his bedroom
[2:29:14.020 --> 2:29:17.540]  That's why he doesn't want to stay at the white house. It's surrounded by a bunch of spies
[2:29:18.100 --> 2:29:23.700]  Trump has to sleep in a big spy base a big globalist command base. The guy's a saint
[2:29:24.340 --> 2:29:28.100]  He's so manly. It's insane. His energy is like 10 bulls
[2:29:28.660 --> 2:29:32.900]  I'm telling you folks. I'm 43 and I am just so sick of all this
[2:29:33.380 --> 2:29:38.900]  It's not that I can't beat him. It's that the the globalists are such scum to study them and to look at them
[2:29:38.900 --> 2:29:44.100]  It's just I can't stand it. I'd bless you Jake. All right. I'm out of time
[2:29:44.100 --> 2:29:48.660]  I've got another special guest coming up that more of your calls straight ahead. Do you want to hear about all the muslim rake games?
[2:29:49.060 --> 2:29:50.580]  Oh the month of the

[2:33:18.420 --> 2:33:21.540]  You are either with the republic or against it
[2:33:21.540 --> 2:33:28.580]  From the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:33:29.300 --> 2:33:32.340]  Celia farber is a journalist joining us from sweden
[2:33:33.540 --> 2:33:38.900]  I mean no kidding. I probably without looking see 15 articles a day or more of women being raped all over europe
[2:33:40.180 --> 2:33:47.300]  The police coming out almost every day saying they've been ordered in germany sweden france the netherlands to cover up the rapes
[2:33:47.380 --> 2:33:48.580]  there was a new one out
[2:33:48.580 --> 2:33:54.580]  for uh asylum seeker arrested after abusing 18 women during two hour train journey
[2:33:55.300 --> 2:33:59.220]  Because in these radical islamic orthodox cultures is a woman is out
[2:34:00.020 --> 2:34:02.340]  And she's not wearing a hood over her head you get to rape her
[2:34:03.140 --> 2:34:07.300]  And or if she's even unattended by a man you get to rape her and then she gets charged with rape
[2:34:08.100 --> 2:34:13.700]  Now I the craziest thing is seeing women in germany chanting a la hawk bar and handing on her jibs
[2:34:14.660 --> 2:34:16.500]  same thing in new york
[2:34:16.500 --> 2:34:20.180]  This is stockholm syndrome and I guess our guest is in sweden so she can
[2:34:20.740 --> 2:34:25.940]  Uh, you know explain that to us, but obviously stockholm syndrome didn't come from sweden. It was first identified in sweden
[2:34:25.940 --> 2:34:29.300]  But let's say a thousand years ago vikings pulled up at your little
[2:34:29.780 --> 2:34:36.420]  You know anglo-saxon village and grabbed you, you know and holds you off and you were say a 15 year old girl
[2:34:37.140 --> 2:34:38.900]  And they start raping you and stuff
[2:34:38.900 --> 2:34:43.300]  You're going to try to go ahead and conform and cook them food and be nice to them and hope when they're done with you
[2:34:43.300 --> 2:34:47.540]  They just throw you off on the side of the shore somewhere else and don't throw you over the side of the boat
[2:34:48.420 --> 2:34:55.220]  So it's the same deal. And so it's stockholm syndrome and liberalism modern liberalism is a mass stockholm syndrome
[2:34:56.420 --> 2:35:02.580]  Western men have conformed really trying to empower women. So we've become cuckold now now. That's my view on it, but
[2:35:03.620 --> 2:35:09.780]  Um, miss farber is an american print journalist an author an investigative reporter based in new york city and sweden
[2:35:09.780 --> 2:35:16.020]  Um, and she was a early critic of the political correctness in all forms and has covered a range of topics from magazines
[2:35:16.020 --> 2:35:23.140]  Including spin rolling stone esquire harpers interview salon gear new york press media posts the new york post and sunday herald
[2:35:23.620 --> 2:35:27.460]  And in 1998 report on the oj Simpson post trial life in esquire
[2:35:28.020 --> 2:35:34.420]  Uh, she is a daughter radio talk show host at barry farber and a graduate of new york university truth barrier dot com
[2:35:34.900 --> 2:35:37.540]  Follow her on twitter. You can go there and find that as well
[2:35:37.540 --> 2:35:41.700]  She's also on facebook, but what I find interesting is I remember the last 20 years
[2:35:41.700 --> 2:35:46.660]  There were lots of people owed and called right wing or left wing that spoke out against political correctness. I mean seinfeld has
[2:35:47.300 --> 2:35:50.500]  But it just seems like it doesn't care like a cult. It just gets
[2:35:51.380 --> 2:35:57.300]  Worse and worse and more and more crazy. There are people calling joe rogan racist for having me on. I'm not racist. Everybody knows he's
[2:35:58.100 --> 2:36:02.100]  Liberal a lot of issues, but he now becomes racist. It just doesn't work anymore
[2:36:02.100 --> 2:36:07.300]  So miss farber explained to me your your your overview of what's happening currently and then
[2:36:07.860 --> 2:36:14.660]  Uh, you're the reports you wanted to break down about all these gang rapes and people video taping in and just the type of bizarre
[2:36:15.940 --> 2:36:23.700]  Uh outburst we're seeing not just in europe, but also here in the united states that it's acceptable if it's muslims. What do you think's happening?
[2:36:25.780 --> 2:36:27.460]  Well
[2:36:27.460 --> 2:36:29.460]  Great to be with you
[2:36:29.460 --> 2:36:32.420]  I listen to your show every day. Well, thank you for joining us. Thank you
[2:36:34.100 --> 2:36:36.100]  I actually at this very strange
[2:36:36.900 --> 2:36:39.460]  Silence bubble here in sweden because I I'll see
[2:36:40.500 --> 2:36:42.500]  The stories that are happening in sweden
[2:36:42.980 --> 2:36:48.340]  Very often I find out about them first of all on info wars. I go to the grocery store
[2:36:48.420 --> 2:36:50.660]  I see the newspaper that one right here, right?
[2:36:51.060 --> 2:36:56.340]  And and I'll and you'll say oh shock sweden, right? And I don't see a word about it in the swedish press
[2:36:56.340 --> 2:36:59.300]  So the first thing is that we're in a
[2:36:59.940 --> 2:37:05.700]  Like probably the most extremist outpost of political correctness on the planet right here
[2:37:06.500 --> 2:37:11.940]  um, but also there's a cultural tradition of of of silence and cloaking
[2:37:12.420 --> 2:37:19.140]  Which is why I want to I want to tell you about the uh, the outburst the uh, the uh, the uh, there's a
[2:37:19.700 --> 2:37:21.380]  There's a freedom
[2:37:21.380 --> 2:37:28.340]  movement that is just days old that has been bursting forth um from a couple of brave characters who again
[2:37:28.420 --> 2:37:30.420]  I I learned about them first on info wars
[2:37:30.580 --> 2:37:34.420]  But let's talk about it because it seems the harder you hold on a beach ball under water
[2:37:34.660 --> 2:37:36.980]  The stronger it ends up coming, uh, you know up out of the water
[2:37:37.060 --> 2:37:41.780]  So let's talk about the type of mind control because I mean it's admitted. That's where Stockholm syndrome
[2:37:41.780 --> 2:37:43.780]  I guess it was first identified
[2:37:43.780 --> 2:37:49.700]  Why are the Swedes so so susceptible to basically cultural mind control?
[2:37:49.700 --> 2:37:51.380]  Oh
[2:37:51.380 --> 2:37:56.500]  Boy, that's a great question. It's a big question. I uh as a Swedish American
[2:37:56.500 --> 2:37:59.620]  I moved here when I was 11 years old and then moved back to the states
[2:37:59.620 --> 2:38:01.300]  And I've spent most of my life in the states
[2:38:01.300 --> 2:38:06.180]  But I've been looking at Sweden trying to figure them out for a very long time and that's a that's a great question
[2:38:06.260 --> 2:38:08.260]  It's a it's a rare
[2:38:08.420 --> 2:38:15.860]  Extreme society where they started the so the social engineering that is so that you depict so brilliantly on your show
[2:38:15.860 --> 2:38:22.100]  So they they mastered it here. They started it here. It started here in the 1950s
[2:38:22.660 --> 2:38:27.460]  So I hope we can maybe return to this in future comes here. Let's go. I mean an hour in the future
[2:38:27.460 --> 2:38:31.540]  This sounds really important and I'm aware of it, but you live it. You've been there you report on it
[2:38:31.540 --> 2:38:36.180]  I mean it's it's just it seems like it's a self-hate or a giving over of the will
[2:38:36.260 --> 2:38:38.260]  I mean really low crime really nice people
[2:38:38.740 --> 2:38:43.780]  Historically, I mean, you know, it's a it's a cliche, but it's true, you know, Canadians Swedes
[2:38:43.780 --> 2:38:46.020]  Uh, you know folks look are known for being really nice
[2:38:46.820 --> 2:38:48.100]  they're very
[2:38:48.100 --> 2:38:50.100]  I want to say the very
[2:38:50.500 --> 2:38:53.540]  Decent good law-abiding cautious
[2:38:54.260 --> 2:38:56.260]  Decent really decent people
[2:38:56.260 --> 2:39:02.660]  But they're terrified of their of their shadow. They're terrified of of being something
[2:39:03.380 --> 2:39:04.740]  uh
[2:39:04.740 --> 2:39:09.380]  political correctness is like the perfect catastrophe here because of uh
[2:39:09.380 --> 2:39:17.540]  Atheism and Lutheranism and political correctness and socialism and social democracy all these it's like the perfect storm
[2:39:18.020 --> 2:39:22.500]  And then you had the as you say first of all, there's there's many different stories
[2:39:22.580 --> 2:39:28.740]  There's a lot that I've found out just in the last 48 hours that I this isn't exactly my beat. I'm in sweden now
[2:39:28.820 --> 2:39:31.540]  I've been here for several months living here temporarily
[2:39:32.500 --> 2:39:36.740]  So it's I'm not the like the world expert. I just report on what you're witnessing there
[2:39:36.740 --> 2:39:41.940]  Right, right what I'm witnessing is um, as you said the beach ball effect
[2:39:42.660 --> 2:39:44.660]  there's a
[2:39:45.780 --> 2:39:46.900]  There's a
[2:39:46.900 --> 2:39:48.900]  Freshly minted folk hero
[2:39:49.460 --> 2:39:53.780]  And I'm going to go ahead and call him a folk hero even though he's also an anti hero
[2:39:53.860 --> 2:39:58.100]  He's also under attack and you've reported on him. His name is peter
[2:39:58.740 --> 2:40:01.700]  spinning out it in swedish. He's a he's a he's he's a
[2:40:02.740 --> 2:40:04.740]  a policeman and
[2:40:04.740 --> 2:40:10.980]  Investigator criminal investigator in a city called urabrew happened to be the city I grew up in and he
[2:40:11.460 --> 2:40:13.940]  posted a facebook post that seems to be the
[2:40:14.580 --> 2:40:18.900]  Like the turning point for the they're calling it some people are calling it the swedish spring
[2:40:19.220 --> 2:40:24.020]  I think he posted it on february 3rd and the words have become iconic
[2:40:24.820 --> 2:40:29.940]  It's gotten translated in the west as I'm so f-ing tired
[2:40:29.940 --> 2:40:35.700]  But it's actually a bit softer in the original swedish really it's like a saying I'm so damn tired, right?
[2:40:36.020 --> 2:40:39.860]  So he says I'm so damn tired essentially of having to
[2:40:40.820 --> 2:40:48.660]  Lie, it's not even lie. It's repressed. This is like the headquarters of repression on the planet. You're tired of turning his will over
[2:40:49.940 --> 2:40:55.300]  He okay, this is what I still have to unpack and investigate exactly what the law says
[2:40:55.300 --> 2:40:59.940]  But there are codes here in sweden that preclude
[2:41:00.820 --> 2:41:02.820]  police investigators from
[2:41:03.460 --> 2:41:05.220]  indicating the
[2:41:05.220 --> 2:41:11.220]  Ethnicity of the people perpetrating the car or religion in fact it was in the news last year that they've told the swedes
[2:41:11.540 --> 2:41:15.540]  Don't report muslim crimes basically or don't don't put it in the database that it was muslims
[2:41:15.700 --> 2:41:20.900]  And they just say oh look swedish men are raping more women all of a sudden it's up a thousand percent the last 10 years
[2:41:20.900 --> 2:41:22.900]  Well, it's not swedish men
[2:41:22.900 --> 2:41:30.260]  The here's how it comes across when you're here looking at a newspaper stand. It'll just say the crime
[2:41:31.220 --> 2:41:36.500]  And it won't and there's the the faces are always pixelated. There's never any identifying
[2:41:36.900 --> 2:41:41.940]  Factors whatsoever, but it almost I want to tell you something. I went to get to a juice bar today here
[2:41:42.020 --> 2:41:44.020]  and I'm in a city called Uppsala
[2:41:44.420 --> 2:41:45.540]  and
[2:41:45.540 --> 2:41:47.540]  Gentleman who made my juice
[2:41:47.540 --> 2:41:53.060]  I said I said, where are you from? He said well, I'm proud to be swedish and then any kind of smile and he said
[2:41:53.060 --> 2:41:54.900]  But I was born in turkey
[2:41:54.900 --> 2:42:00.500]  And I came here when I was 12 years old and I said what do you think of this peter spring are a situation and he said
[2:42:01.060 --> 2:42:02.660]  If they fire him
[2:42:02.660 --> 2:42:07.700]  Because he's under severe attack. He's under criminal investigation for his facebook post. They fire him
[2:42:08.340 --> 2:42:13.700]  I'll raise the money. I'll spearhead the movement to raise the money to a fundraiser for him
[2:42:13.700 --> 2:42:18.100]  Because he said what's happened with all this political correctness is that
[2:42:19.060 --> 2:42:21.060]  Law abiding swedish
[2:42:21.620 --> 2:42:25.380]  Immigrants have are suffering every single day. Exactly. Let's be clear
[2:42:25.460 --> 2:42:30.420]  This hurts all the good immigrants that people need and want just saying here's millions of totally
[2:42:30.980 --> 2:42:37.780]  Unvetted military zone age men screaming a la Akbar letting in a bunch of barbarians. It's insane
[2:42:37.780 --> 2:42:44.020]  We're exactly exactly. So this isn't working for anybody. It's like it's like a politically correct
[2:42:44.740 --> 2:42:50.580]  Super experiment gone disastrous because it's just finished. It's they're creating racism. They're creating
[2:42:51.140 --> 2:42:56.740]  I don't think the swedish people are racist. I think they're they're sure but it's going to trigger survival mechanisms
[2:42:57.140 --> 2:43:02.260]  When when you turn on the news share and it's like kill the whites whites are inherently bad and it's white people running it
[2:43:02.260 --> 2:43:08.580]  There's clearly a plan and it's to put people into racial groups for control. Well, exactly
[2:43:08.660 --> 2:43:13.540]  And I think and it's like the racism of low expectation and now it's the racism of oh
[2:43:14.100 --> 2:43:19.380]  You can't even say anything. You can't have a newspaper headline. A policeman can't say what crime he's
[2:43:20.100 --> 2:43:24.660]  Investigating so that just creates this super creepy feeling which you have in the whole country now
[2:43:24.900 --> 2:43:30.500]  like what are we being so quiet about and and you know and and it just makes everybody
[2:43:30.500 --> 2:43:34.900]  Would you say though that the Swedes are really under the surface getting ready to burst out?
[2:43:34.900 --> 2:43:36.900]  I mean, I've been hearing that's happening people
[2:43:37.540 --> 2:43:39.540]  I want to give you some very
[2:43:40.020 --> 2:43:45.460]  Stats on that. Yes, it isn't happening. It has happened and here's how it has happened this guy
[2:43:45.620 --> 2:43:48.260]  Peter spring others cut and put this facebook post up
[2:43:48.980 --> 2:43:56.420]  Um, it got the the group in a couple of days has gotten. I think the number is up to about 160 000 followers
[2:43:57.140 --> 2:43:58.420]  um
[2:43:58.420 --> 2:44:02.660]  10 and that's a lot for people there because nobody would ever criticize the government of the state
[2:44:02.900 --> 2:44:08.980]  So that's a huge deal never and it's so they're kind of signing their modern declaration of independence against political correctness
[2:44:09.700 --> 2:44:12.180]  Yes, they are and it's scary for them because
[2:44:13.540 --> 2:44:16.340]  You're you stand accused and this is very real
[2:44:16.980 --> 2:44:23.620]  Of being a racist if you support this has been the absolute mantra anywhere you go in society where people say
[2:44:23.620 --> 2:44:27.860]  And I have this discussion with friends and they say to it just always comes up
[2:44:28.020 --> 2:44:28.820]  well
[2:44:28.820 --> 2:44:36.260]  If we stress the ethnicity of the people committing these crimes a reasonable person could argue that's going to create
[2:44:36.660 --> 2:44:42.900]  You know racial tension and racial hatred, but the opposite has been as it's the immigrants that want this
[2:44:43.460 --> 2:44:45.460]  PC nonsense to stop
[2:44:45.860 --> 2:44:49.300]  It's not it's worse than nonsense. It's more malicious than nonsense exactly
[2:44:49.300 --> 2:44:53.220]  In fact, let's go over some of these numbers and first let's scroll back to one of his letters that's gotten him in trouble
[2:44:53.460 --> 2:44:58.260]  If I don't know if you can see it on your screen, but if not, we'll read some of it where he's talking about
[2:44:59.220 --> 2:45:03.140]  What it's like our retirees are on its knees. The school is one of chaos
[2:45:03.460 --> 2:45:07.720]  Health care is an inferno police have been completely destroyed. Well, it's collapsed Europe folks
[2:45:08.100 --> 2:45:10.100]  except except everyone knows
[2:45:10.580 --> 2:45:16.420]  Why but no one dares or wants to pedal reason folks five million in europe, okay western europe alone just it's it
[2:45:16.420 --> 2:45:23.300]  I mean french roads are shutting down. I mean it's it's incredible because sweden has always lived on the myth of the magnificent ultimate society
[2:45:24.100 --> 2:45:29.620]  That has unlimited resources to be in the forefront when it comes to being the only politically correct
[2:45:30.180 --> 2:45:32.180]  opinion in the dysfunctional world
[2:45:32.180 --> 2:45:35.700]  That bend over herself through the destructive behavior of various
[2:45:36.260 --> 2:45:40.420]  Religions names. Here we go and it's right political correctness is a new religion. It's a cult
[2:45:40.500 --> 2:45:44.340]  So say sweden's been under cults. He's saying now it's under a new one. Here we go
[2:45:44.340 --> 2:45:48.260]  Uh, this I have handled monday friday this week rape rape
[2:45:48.740 --> 2:45:52.820]  Aggravated rape assault rape extortion blackmail abuse on judicial procedure
[2:45:53.140 --> 2:45:57.140]  Unlawful threats violence against the police the threat to the police drug trafficking
[2:45:57.540 --> 2:46:02.420]  Aggravated drug offenses attempted murder rape rape, you know again extortion and he goes on to explain
[2:46:02.900 --> 2:46:07.060]  Suspected perpetrators ollie mohammed mohammed mohammed mohammed ollie again again again
[2:46:07.140 --> 2:46:11.940]  It's just over and over again, but he's not supposed to say it mohammed mohammed ollie again and again and again
[2:46:11.940 --> 2:46:19.540]  And where are they coming from iraq turkey syria afghanistan simalia simalia syria again simalia unknown country unknown unknown sweden
[2:46:20.580 --> 2:46:26.420]  So finally somebody from sweden half of the suspects we cannot know for sure because they have no valid papers
[2:46:26.740 --> 2:46:29.940]  Which again trump's pointing out they go you're lying. They're all valid. They're all valid
[2:46:30.180 --> 2:46:33.220]  Which itself often means that they lie about nationality identity
[2:46:33.860 --> 2:46:35.860]  Wow powerful police continue ma'am
[2:46:35.860 --> 2:46:43.380]  He so yeah that so what happened after that so he got this huge not only storm of of support
[2:46:43.940 --> 2:46:47.620]  Facebook and let's just be clear sweden's an incredibly low crime country
[2:46:47.620 --> 2:46:51.220]  That's why this is so shocking for one investigator in one week. Go ahead
[2:46:52.020 --> 2:46:58.660]  Yeah, uh, the huge support on facebook huge foreign social media and and and this i think is so fascinating
[2:46:58.900 --> 2:47:01.540]  Flowers started to pour into the police station
[2:47:01.540 --> 2:47:07.300]  And just just you know hundreds of bouquets of flowers people and that and that and that this is unusual
[2:47:07.300 --> 2:47:10.340]  This kind of stuff doesn't really so that makes it safe for him to speak out
[2:47:10.740 --> 2:47:15.700]  If they can't burn him then it makes it safe for everybody and the dam of oppression and bullying collapses
[2:47:16.820 --> 2:47:21.540]  Precisely, but listen what happened next you may notice already. They uh, in fact, you probably reported
[2:47:22.580 --> 2:47:26.580]  They they tried somebody in the police station said there's a ban now on
[2:47:26.580 --> 2:47:32.340]  Taking pictures of the flowers. So you were not allowed to just invent laws now as they go
[2:47:32.420 --> 2:47:34.420]  You can't take pictures of flowers
[2:47:34.740 --> 2:47:39.220]  But people did anyway and they leaked out anyway, and why can't we take pictures of flowers?
[2:47:39.460 --> 2:47:43.460]  Oh, because uh, you don't know what could be in the flowers. It could be some security threat
[2:47:44.100 --> 2:47:47.780]  You know, so so it gets comical. It's getting it's getting really comical
[2:47:47.780 --> 2:47:53.300]  So these flowers are pouring in meanwhile. He's under criminal investigation for there's a there's a swedish law
[2:47:53.300 --> 2:47:56.500]  I'm going to say it in swedish and I explain what it is. It's called hetz
[2:47:57.140 --> 2:48:05.060]  Mut for get up hetz is um inciting hatred against a particular group of people like a minority group
[2:48:05.460 --> 2:48:09.620]  So there are laws against this and I you know, I like the I like these laws on principle
[2:48:09.700 --> 2:48:15.140]  Sure, but really all it means now is you have no free speech when a group's overrunning you that doesn't follow such an open society
[2:48:15.700 --> 2:48:18.580]  Right, but you really what the people he's expressing
[2:48:18.580 --> 2:48:23.860]  And rage against this not any particular ethnicity or religion. It's his
[2:48:24.500 --> 2:48:28.900]  Bosses at the police house that are stifling that are censoring him and gagging him
[2:48:28.980 --> 2:48:30.660]  So he doesn't have
[2:48:30.660 --> 2:48:36.740]  He can't function as a police officer and there are many so this guy's a modern pulver there. It's a huge international story
[2:48:37.220 --> 2:48:39.700]  Do you think you'll hang on or are they so arrogant they're going to fire him?
[2:48:40.580 --> 2:48:44.660]  I think there's so here's what you have to understand, but I think they're gonna I think they're gonna
[2:48:44.660 --> 2:48:51.300]  I don't think they're gonna fire him. They're gonna make him suffer. They're gonna make him, you know, walk the plank of shame
[2:48:52.100 --> 2:48:56.740]  There are a lot of editorials. He should just quit and start his own media organization and expose the whole thing
[2:48:57.940 --> 2:49:03.300]  What I do think though is be flooded with money. So here's the answer use economy against him if I was him
[2:49:03.540 --> 2:49:05.460]  That's it. That's it. I'm not my own news organization
[2:49:05.620 --> 2:49:06.980]  In fact, I'll even leave Sweden
[2:49:06.980 --> 2:49:13.540]  But I'm gonna beam an end over the internet right into you with citizen sending me data as the citizen intelligence core
[2:49:13.540 --> 2:49:16.900]  And we're going to expose the whole thing and have migrants that are good migrants
[2:49:17.060 --> 2:49:21.540]  You'll right there with them working with the citizen core to expose it victory. That's the plan
[2:49:22.260 --> 2:49:30.500]  Let me tell you what else has happened really fascinating a lot of people on the facebook support page said so the mainstream media are attacking attacking attacking saying he's racist
[2:49:30.900 --> 2:49:33.220]  Saying he's pretending he cares about police work
[2:49:33.220 --> 2:49:36.260]  But really he's just a racist who's waiting to jump out as a racist
[2:49:36.500 --> 2:49:40.580]  So he's being attacked by mainstream media all over the place people on the facebook page
[2:49:40.580 --> 2:49:46.340]  And this is you know thousands people are saying that they are deleting their apps for these major magazines
[2:49:46.340 --> 2:49:50.500]  So this is like their equivalent of the you know, new york times. Sure. There's beagle all of it
[2:49:50.900 --> 2:49:54.260]  People are people are breaking with the establishment. They're sick of their lives
[2:49:54.420 --> 2:50:00.180]  So they're so they're forcing a turning point and other people were saying I don't haven't had those apps
[2:50:00.180 --> 2:50:05.220]  I haven't read those trash publications in years, but I'm going to download the app just so I can cancel it
[2:50:05.220 --> 2:50:11.540]  Like people are real. I've never seen Swedes like this. I've never seen them sound like that's why they put an impressive culture over them
[2:50:11.540 --> 2:50:17.220]  Because they're like really actually aggressive germanic tribes and they've been under control just like the brits haven't others
[2:50:17.220 --> 2:50:21.140]  And then once they break out of it, everybody will see why those social controls are put in place
[2:50:21.700 --> 2:50:26.660]  They're terrified. I think they're genuinely terrified. They really do not want to be they don't want to hurt anybody
[2:50:26.740 --> 2:50:32.340]  They don't want to be racist the average swede is genuinely afraid of like what if I talk about this stuff
[2:50:32.340 --> 2:50:38.980]  And uh, you know, I make things worse deal Peter Sutherland said we're going to flood sweden to make an anti european
[2:50:39.300 --> 2:50:41.300]  So we're not bringing people in everybody living peace together
[2:50:41.300 --> 2:50:43.300]  The plan is to make us fight with each other
[2:50:43.380 --> 2:50:48.500]  So you're actually fighting racism to fight the u.n program to create the balkanized destroyed
[2:50:49.060 --> 2:50:51.940]  Culture that doesn't work together. We'll be back with our guests

[2:56:28.820 --> 2:56:32.660]  Uh, he is sweden. You're an american swede back in sweden
[2:56:33.380 --> 2:56:37.540]  This tipping point this this explosion of awakening your witnessing. Please continue
[2:56:37.540 --> 2:56:45.860]  Yeah, fascinating. Um, there's this policeman peter spitting at her who I just heard do people are calling a folk hero and he is
[2:56:46.340 --> 2:56:47.460]  um
[2:56:47.460 --> 2:56:49.460]  There's there was a woman
[2:56:49.460 --> 2:56:57.460]  Fascinating story happened about three weeks ago that preceded him and I guess you could call them co belligerence co folk heroes
[2:56:57.860 --> 2:57:04.820]  Uh, she um her name is she's an author of children's books. Her name is katarina katarina janush. She's check
[2:57:04.820 --> 2:57:11.540]  I grew up in sweden since she was a child and she was doing an interview on check television in check
[2:57:12.020 --> 2:57:15.860]  And she described the collect collapse of the swedish infrastructure
[2:57:16.340 --> 2:57:23.460]  Which you just depicted and she gave statistics and it was not inflammatory. I've read the text it translated english
[2:57:23.860 --> 2:57:25.860]  Yeah, completely politely
[2:57:25.860 --> 2:57:30.500]  Europe's being overweight and its infrastructure the best in the world is disintegrating
[2:57:30.500 --> 2:57:37.220]  Oh, this what happened the the thought police they found they found they they saw the interview and she was absolutely
[2:57:38.100 --> 2:57:40.820]  lambasted in swedish media the main newspapers
[2:57:40.900 --> 2:57:47.540]  They wrote editorials against her and at least one bookstore if not more got rid of her books wouldn't sell her books
[2:57:47.860 --> 2:57:54.180]  So there's this uh, this this campaign this pogrom against her and what they said here's the crux of it
[2:57:54.500 --> 2:57:59.540]  They said, you know, she she would her facts were incorrect and she was inciting racial
[2:57:59.540 --> 2:58:05.140]  Um, uh, you know hatred. Yeah, I mean you bring in five million people from third world countries
[2:58:05.540 --> 2:58:10.180]  And then they run around raping and burning stuff and crapping on the street. That's gonna hurt your country
[2:58:11.060 --> 2:58:13.060]  Well, so it was like a thought crime incident
[2:58:13.380 --> 2:58:19.700]  But what I see what they're really saying they're not saying you're not allowed to say these things about other ethnicities
[2:58:19.780 --> 2:58:23.220]  What they're saying is you're not allowed to say these things about sweden
[2:58:23.780 --> 2:58:27.780]  Which brings us to the other thing that everybody who's here knows this about this country
[2:58:27.780 --> 2:58:35.860]  It's extremely touchy about their reputation very thin skin, but it's bad. No, that's right, but they're the ones wrecking the country
[2:58:36.660 --> 2:58:40.900]  Turning it into sweden stands. So that's their problem. You're trying to save sweden
[2:58:41.380 --> 2:58:43.380]  We'll be back bringing in people from all over the world
[2:58:43.780 --> 2:58:49.860]  Take the japanese you got a bad record. You don't have a good record. You're not coming into japan. We'll be back. Stay with us
[2:58:50.980 --> 2:58:54.020]  We have a priest in new jersey who is starting to sound like one of us
[2:58:54.020 --> 2:59:00.420]  Father peter west a catholic priest in the archdiocese of new work is an avid trump supporter and not afraid to show it
[2:59:00.500 --> 2:59:07.620]  This is a priest who posts on social media daily taking on such topics as radical islam millennial safe spaces and modern-day liberals
[2:59:07.780 --> 2:59:14.100]  Now father west has fallen under scrutiny from some of his colleagues who believe he is acting inappropriately and has gone too far
[2:59:14.260 --> 2:59:21.700]  In 2004 a former st. Louis archbishop carnal rehmann burk took a hard political stance when he refused to allow the at the time
[2:59:21.700 --> 2:59:29.700]  Senator john carrey to receive communion for his pro-choice views now burk is an avid trump supporter who has spoken out against radical islam
[2:59:29.780 --> 2:59:36.660]  And was demoted in 2014 by pope francis from the head of the vatican's highest court to a ceremonial position
[2:59:36.740 --> 2:59:39.220]  Because of his public disagreements with pope francis
[2:59:39.300 --> 2:59:46.580]  It's not surprising that father west is gaining national attention and support because going against political correctness is growing in popularity
[2:59:46.580 --> 2:59:52.900]  This is owens royer for info wars dot com so not pc
[2:59:53.620 --> 2:59:56.260]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:59:56.260 --> 3:00:07.700]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance you're listening to alex jones
[3:00:26.500 --> 3:00:28.500]  You
[3:00:44.260 --> 3:00:49.380]  All right, joe rogan just sent me a text and i still can't talk about it, but speaking of censorship in sweden
[3:00:51.300 --> 3:00:52.900]  he has the most
[3:00:52.900 --> 3:00:57.700]  Downloaded podcast in history and itunes did finally update the top
[3:00:58.740 --> 3:01:00.740]  podcast of all time
[3:01:00.820 --> 3:01:02.820]  It's not even listed in the in there
[3:01:03.460 --> 3:01:08.900]  So it's the top one ever. They're not listing it on youtube either in the trending. It's all been blocked out
[3:01:09.380 --> 3:01:11.380]  It's been censored a lot of people on google play
[3:01:13.620 --> 3:01:15.620]  And uh
[3:01:15.700 --> 3:01:17.700]  i'm gonna talk to joe after the show here
[3:01:17.700 --> 3:01:23.780]  Rapaport's coming up and we're gonna air a key report on code next. This is the next level of agenda 21
[3:01:24.740 --> 3:01:28.580]  But man, I tell you there are so many censorship articles here in the us now
[3:01:29.780 --> 3:01:35.700]  That we look at europe or sweden who's one of the worst and say oh look at them. It's already here, but it's stealth
[3:01:36.740 --> 3:01:43.060]  Here they don't even say oh you're censored. They just start censoring you and joe rogan is in like 20 big movies
[3:01:43.060 --> 3:01:49.620]  He's hosted five number one tv shows. He's the host of the ufc. He's one of the top comedians in the country
[3:01:50.020 --> 3:01:52.020]  He sells out arenas of 20 000 people
[3:01:54.340 --> 3:02:00.900]  His podcast hundreds of millions of people downloaded a month the biggest one he's ever had and it is censored
[3:02:02.020 --> 3:02:04.500]  Because again, you go on the charts. That's how you get even bigger
[3:02:05.140 --> 3:02:08.340]  So he has like the number one song, but it's not on the charts
[3:02:08.340 --> 3:02:14.020]  But they're playing on the radio and he's now investigated. I just talked to him during the break. He is pissed
[3:02:14.420 --> 3:02:16.100]  But i'm not supposed to talk about the details
[3:02:16.100 --> 3:02:19.700]  I've been sent screenshots of everything until he gives me the green light, but man
[3:02:20.100 --> 3:02:22.100]  It's weird to be number one
[3:02:22.100 --> 3:02:24.260]  And and just just have it all ignored
[3:02:25.220 --> 3:02:30.900]  And watch all these peacocks on the news. It's just it's with their million viewers an hour like there's something
[3:02:31.060 --> 3:02:35.220]  Getting back to our guests. I want to have you back for a full hour soon to get into more of this
[3:02:35.220 --> 3:02:38.260]  Uh, but just just just finishing up with what you were getting into
[3:02:40.180 --> 3:02:42.180]  Well, I was just reporting a story
[3:02:42.420 --> 3:02:48.820]  Um, it's going to come out in the spectator that actually goes against what all of us think is going on with immigration Sweden
[3:02:49.380 --> 3:02:53.300]  Very shocking turns out they have a new
[3:02:53.860 --> 3:02:58.980]  Uh, they have new developments in their immigration and deportation laws
[3:02:59.540 --> 3:03:00.420]  that
[3:03:00.420 --> 3:03:07.460]  Make what what trump attackers think of trump. They make it all look like, you know sesame street. Mr. Rogers
[3:03:08.420 --> 3:03:10.420]  They deport
[3:03:10.340 --> 3:03:12.020]  minors
[3:03:12.020 --> 3:03:17.620]  Back to war zones from sweden. This is as of 2016. This is complicated
[3:03:18.420 --> 3:03:20.420]  It's hopefully we can do this more in another show
[3:03:20.740 --> 3:03:24.420]  But I just found out about it. There was a big story that caught my attention
[3:03:24.420 --> 3:03:27.780]  There was a nine-year-old girl who was going to she was on the cover of the papers
[3:03:27.780 --> 3:03:34.420]  She was going to be deported back to morocco alone away from her mother and her siblings and her stepfathers made no sense
[3:03:34.900 --> 3:03:39.700]  So there's bizarre things happening in immigration law that have to do with
[3:03:40.900 --> 3:03:47.380]  Um, strange deals that have been struck between the eu and afghanistan and money went from the eu to afghanistan
[3:03:47.380 --> 3:03:52.660]  So they would take people back when they're putting there and and here's where I actually kind of sighed with
[3:03:52.660 --> 3:03:57.380]  I said, no, I get it. We should be taking in children and women
[3:03:57.620 --> 3:04:03.700]  We should be taking in foaming at the mouth crazy 25 year old jihadi men. So where's the feminism there?
[3:04:04.100 --> 3:04:06.660]  Why is it mainly men being brought in because they can get there?
[3:04:07.380 --> 3:04:11.940]  And they're breaking their own they were the one for one of the first countries to sign the un
[3:04:12.100 --> 3:04:15.860]  I forget what's called exactly the convention something, you know the protection of children
[3:04:16.500 --> 3:04:20.100]  And they've gone against it and amnesty international has denounced them
[3:04:20.100 --> 3:04:26.180]  So there's just like weird dark strain in the midst of we all think sweden is just rolling over and being so nice
[3:04:26.260 --> 3:04:31.140]  They're not being so nice. There's really at the very same time. This is testing everything
[3:04:31.140 --> 3:04:37.460]  The globalist plan to implode borders worldwide then exploit the lower wages of everybody and let's face it not to be politically correct
[3:04:37.460 --> 3:04:38.340]  It's just true
[3:04:38.340 --> 3:04:41.620]  It's the third world populations of the most exploited in all of this
[3:04:42.100 --> 3:04:48.820]  But it's western life boats that have to be kept afloat to actually have true globalism in the future and empower the entire world
[3:04:48.820 --> 3:04:50.820]  Thank you so much for the time

[3:08:36.900 --> 3:08:40.740]  John rap report sitting in here for alex in the fourth hour
[3:08:41.940 --> 3:08:44.100]  We're going to have a big investigative report here
[3:08:45.380 --> 3:08:48.500]  And i'm probably going to take up most of the hour with it
[3:08:48.500 --> 3:08:53.460]  The article which i wrote recently at no more fake news
[3:08:54.580 --> 3:08:56.260]  The number one
[3:08:56.260 --> 3:08:58.980]  Mind control program at u.s colleges
[3:09:00.820 --> 3:09:05.540]  So we start here everybody knows about this insane
[3:09:07.140 --> 3:09:11.380]  Triggering safe spaces microaggressions
[3:09:12.260 --> 3:09:14.260]  A fad trend
[3:09:14.260 --> 3:09:20.900]  And movement that has broken out at colleges. Oh, you said something it triggered me
[3:09:21.220 --> 3:09:26.980]  I saw hollywood a halloween costume and i freaked out and now i have to go to a room
[3:09:27.540 --> 3:09:34.740]  Where they get hot chocolate and play with dolls and a little train sets and i mean what at a college
[3:09:35.460 --> 3:09:40.260]  A higher institution of learning at many colleges this is happening
[3:09:40.260 --> 3:09:45.460]  And of course it goes along with politically correct speech and so on and so forth, but
[3:09:46.900 --> 3:09:49.700]  You know people are just boggled by this
[3:09:50.740 --> 3:09:52.740]  What are these kids talking about?
[3:09:54.340 --> 3:10:01.700]  Safe spaces microaggressions. I'm triggered. I'm triggered. I'm triggered. You know, where did this come from?
[3:10:03.060 --> 3:10:05.060]  How did it start?
[3:10:05.060 --> 3:10:11.540]  So i've been lurking around in the shadows for a couple years piling up information on this
[3:10:12.980 --> 3:10:16.660]  And i needed a few final pieces and i finally got them
[3:10:17.620 --> 3:10:25.220]  And then the last piece fell into place. So i'm going to tell you exactly where all this stuff came from
[3:10:26.820 --> 3:10:32.820]  From the national alliance on mental illness comes this statistic
[3:10:32.820 --> 3:10:34.820]  In one year
[3:10:36.820 --> 3:10:41.700]  25 percent of all college students in the u.s
[3:10:42.900 --> 3:10:48.740]  Have either been diagnosed with a mental disorder or treated for a mental disorder
[3:10:50.420 --> 3:10:57.300]  One out of four across the u.s in colleges all colleges
[3:10:57.300 --> 3:11:10.180]  Let's let's think in for a second. Okay, let us observe a micro second of silence on that one
[3:11:13.460 --> 3:11:18.740]  In other words these colleges and universities have been turned into psychiatric clinics
[3:11:19.860 --> 3:11:21.860]  Let's face it. I mean come on
[3:11:21.860 --> 3:11:28.420]  That's the story. That's the underlying story whether it's a diagnosis of adhd
[3:11:29.140 --> 3:11:34.180]  Or clinical depression or bipolar or you know, whatever it is
[3:11:36.420 --> 3:11:41.460]  And the treatment with highly highly active toxic drugs
[3:11:42.900 --> 3:11:44.900]  So what does that do?
[3:11:45.700 --> 3:11:48.420]  That creates a complete culture of victimhood
[3:11:48.420 --> 3:11:54.820]  I don't care what hillary clinton advocates or you know who cares
[3:11:56.180 --> 3:12:01.460]  These kids now can have a right to consider themselves victims. Well, I have a problem
[3:12:02.180 --> 3:12:04.820]  And so what's the next step? Well, this explains
[3:12:05.620 --> 3:12:11.060]  Why I have a problem because I have a mental disorder. Okay. Wow. There we go
[3:12:11.860 --> 3:12:13.860]  I'm off the hook
[3:12:13.860 --> 3:12:20.100]  Problems studying don't know who to date or how to introduce myself to somebody or get a long
[3:12:21.060 --> 3:12:23.060]  Sociability at college
[3:12:23.140 --> 3:12:25.940]  You know, kid doesn't know what to do all of this
[3:12:26.740 --> 3:12:28.580]  suddenly
[3:12:28.580 --> 3:12:30.580]  Got the answer
[3:12:30.820 --> 3:12:33.940]  Because he had these problems and he wandered into the clinic
[3:12:34.580 --> 3:12:38.580]  Or the infirmary or whatever in the first place and then all of a sudden before he knew it
[3:12:38.580 --> 3:12:45.700]  Oh, well and so forth. We ask you a few questions. And yes, we'd like you to see a psychiatrist or a psychologist
[3:12:47.540 --> 3:12:50.180]  He's got a diagnosis. She's got a diagnosis
[3:12:52.340 --> 3:12:58.660]  Now the victim card is right there you can play at any time you want to well, I couldn't turn in the assignment
[3:12:59.220 --> 3:13:02.020]  No, the dog didn't eat my homework. I have a mental disorder
[3:13:02.740 --> 3:13:04.740]  Well, okay. Wow
[3:13:05.380 --> 3:13:07.140]  Hands off
[3:13:07.140 --> 3:13:11.220]  25% get that through your skull
[3:13:12.820 --> 3:13:15.460]  Of all students at us colleges
[3:13:17.540 --> 3:13:22.500]  Now with that underlying framework, you see
[3:13:24.100 --> 3:13:27.540]  How easy is it to step from there into
[3:13:27.540 --> 3:13:35.860]  A student or students getting together and saying, you know, there's certain things that are going on in the environment here that are upsetting us
[3:13:37.540 --> 3:13:39.540]  That are triggering us
[3:13:43.540 --> 3:13:47.620]  Get it because well, we already have a mental disorder. You see so we're a little bit off
[3:13:48.260 --> 3:13:51.460]  Chemical and balance in the brain whatever whatever whatever
[3:13:52.580 --> 3:13:54.580]  There you have it
[3:13:54.580 --> 3:13:56.580]  Now we have a right
[3:13:57.460 --> 3:14:03.140]  To begin talking this crazy language and we need to save space in a room and the teachers and staff
[3:14:03.620 --> 3:14:08.580]  Have to attend to us and we can regress back into being children
[3:14:08.820 --> 3:14:13.140]  Because we've already been diagnosed by a mental health professional
[3:14:13.620 --> 3:14:18.820]  As having a mental disorder. I hope you really get this because
[3:14:19.700 --> 3:14:21.700]  This is a key to understanding
[3:14:21.700 --> 3:14:29.060]  What is going on not only going on at us colleges and universities, but what is eating out the country from the inside?
[3:14:30.740 --> 3:14:35.700]  The profession of psychiatry and I'm going to break all that down for you
[3:14:36.420 --> 3:14:39.540]  Chapter and verse in this investigative report
[3:14:41.780 --> 3:14:45.220]  But you've got the headline and the top paragraph now
[3:14:45.540 --> 3:14:47.540]  Now you can see
[3:14:48.020 --> 3:14:50.020]  How this whole business
[3:14:50.020 --> 3:14:52.820]  How this whole business came about
[3:14:54.260 --> 3:14:58.980]  And how of course it's destroying the country because of the majority of the best and the brightest
[3:14:59.620 --> 3:15:01.620]  attending colleges and universities
[3:15:02.180 --> 3:15:06.820]  25 of them already at such a young age are being diagnosed with a mental disorder
[3:15:08.420 --> 3:15:12.980]  And drugged with highly toxic brain scrambling drugs
[3:15:12.980 --> 3:15:21.940]  Naturally some bizarre things are going to come up out of the hopper such as I'm triggered. I'm triggered. I'm triggered
[3:15:22.020 --> 3:15:28.740]  I'm triggered. I need to save space. I that was a microaggression. He wore a halloween costume. I'm going psychotic
[3:15:29.700 --> 3:15:32.900]  You bet and the drugs themselves
[3:15:34.740 --> 3:15:39.300]  Create a distorted perception of reality keep that in mind
[3:15:39.300 --> 3:15:46.980]  So that some of these reactions that you're seeing from college students that you scratch your head about and just can't figure out
[3:15:47.380 --> 3:15:49.780]  Are coming from the drugs
[3:15:52.580 --> 3:15:54.580]  Okay
[3:15:55.940 --> 3:16:00.180]  Yeah, I'm getting a little worked up about this. I've been on this case for 20 years now
[3:16:02.020 --> 3:16:04.020]  20 years
[3:16:04.020 --> 3:16:08.500]  Before I get to the next piece, which is gigantic

[3:17:42.340 --> 3:17:45.380]  The diagnostic and statistical manual
[3:17:45.940 --> 3:17:47.940]  of mental disorders
[3:17:47.940 --> 3:17:57.460]  Published by the american psychiatric association and updated every few years. You will find that there is a list
[3:17:58.340 --> 3:18:00.180]  and a description
[3:18:00.180 --> 3:18:02.180]  of roughly
[3:18:02.580 --> 3:18:04.500]  Ready
[3:18:04.500 --> 3:18:06.500]  300 separate and distinct
[3:18:07.940 --> 3:18:09.940]  mental disorders by name
[3:18:10.740 --> 3:18:14.900]  Oppositional defiance disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
[3:18:14.900 --> 3:18:19.300]  clinical depression etc etc the ones you know about and
[3:18:20.260 --> 3:18:23.780]  But obviously the vast majority you've never heard of 300
[3:18:24.740 --> 3:18:26.740]  Okay
[3:18:26.980 --> 3:18:28.980]  Now
[3:18:29.220 --> 3:18:31.220]  Here's the revelation
[3:18:32.100 --> 3:18:34.660]  There is no and listen carefully here
[3:18:35.460 --> 3:18:39.060]  Every word is important. There is no defining
[3:18:40.020 --> 3:18:41.620]  physical
[3:18:41.620 --> 3:18:43.620]  diagnostic tests of any kind
[3:18:43.620 --> 3:18:49.220]  For any of those 300 so-called mental disorders
[3:18:50.500 --> 3:18:52.180]  Not a blood test
[3:18:52.180 --> 3:18:58.580]  Not a hair test not a saliva test not a urine test not a brain scan not a genetic assay
[3:18:59.380 --> 3:19:00.740]  nothing
[3:19:00.740 --> 3:19:03.460]  Zero zilch not a nothing
[3:19:04.580 --> 3:19:10.340]  This in fact is an open secret in the psychiatric community. They understand this
[3:19:10.340 --> 3:19:12.340]  So it would be like
[3:19:13.140 --> 3:19:15.540]  You're going into the doctor and he says, you know
[3:19:16.340 --> 3:19:18.340]  You've got cancer
[3:19:18.340 --> 3:19:19.300]  What?
[3:19:19.300 --> 3:19:21.780]  Yeah, I think you've got cancer
[3:19:23.380 --> 3:19:25.380]  You're gonna run any tests?
[3:19:25.380 --> 3:19:27.540]  No, well, we don't actually have any tests
[3:19:28.260 --> 3:19:34.340]  But from what you say and looking at you, I would say that you've got cancer and it's now time
[3:19:34.340 --> 3:19:41.620]  And it's now time, you know, we could start an hour on some heavy rounds of chemotherapy
[3:19:42.420 --> 3:19:43.540]  Okay
[3:19:43.540 --> 3:19:49.380]  Which of course will stop the reproduction of all your cells and we hope it'll kill the tumors before it kills you
[3:19:49.780 --> 3:19:51.780]  Yeah, but you haven't run any tests
[3:19:52.020 --> 3:19:54.500]  Well, we don't really have any tests. It would be like that

[3:24:11.220 --> 3:24:16.820]  John Rappaport back talking about the number one mind control program at us colleges
[3:24:16.820 --> 3:24:25.780]  So you've got these 300 so-called mental disorders that are listed in the psychiatric bible and there's no diagnostic test
[3:24:26.500 --> 3:24:28.980]  whatsoever for any of them
[3:24:29.780 --> 3:24:36.900]  That defines any of the so-called disorders and that means that a psychiatrist can diagnose you your child
[3:24:37.220 --> 3:24:41.940]  a student at a college with anything that he wants to and then comes the
[3:24:43.220 --> 3:24:44.420]  hammer
[3:24:44.420 --> 3:24:51.460]  The hammer is the drugs and in case you're thinking of trying to worm out of my argument here and say well
[3:24:51.540 --> 3:24:56.260]  But we know that all these mental disorders are chemical imbalances in the brain
[3:24:56.740 --> 3:25:01.060]  False no wrong absolutely wrong because first of all there is no
[3:25:01.700 --> 3:25:03.700]  baseline normal
[3:25:04.340 --> 3:25:05.860]  test for
[3:25:05.860 --> 3:25:09.700]  What a normal baseline chemical balance in the brain is
[3:25:09.700 --> 3:25:15.700]  And I have documented through a an admission by dr. Ronald pies
[3:25:16.420 --> 3:25:19.860]  Who is you know one of these erudite psychiatrists?
[3:25:20.740 --> 3:25:21.940]  with
[3:25:21.940 --> 3:25:33.700]  You know a resume this long retired now emeritus editor and so on who said oh no the chemical imbalance theory of mental illness was always an urban myth
[3:25:35.140 --> 3:25:36.500]  quote
[3:25:36.500 --> 3:25:38.500]  always an urban myth
[3:25:38.500 --> 3:25:40.500]  So that doesn't even hold up
[3:25:42.260 --> 3:25:48.900]  So all these college students and everybody really are completely at the mercy of these psychiatrists who will say well
[3:25:48.900 --> 3:25:52.340]  You've got this disorder that disorder and now comes the drugs
[3:25:54.260 --> 3:26:00.020]  Oh the antidepressants prozac zoloft paxil and so forth in my article
[3:26:01.780 --> 3:26:03.780]  Which is up now at infor wars
[3:26:04.180 --> 3:26:05.540]  number one
[3:26:05.540 --> 3:26:08.340]  Mind control program at u.s colleges. You can see
[3:26:09.540 --> 3:26:14.500]  The effects of these drugs as cited in study after study after study and their
[3:26:16.500 --> 3:26:22.660]  Influence how they push people over the edge into committing violence and when I say violence
[3:26:23.460 --> 3:26:25.700]  Yes, could be throwing a rock through a window
[3:26:26.340 --> 3:26:31.140]  But it could also be murder could also be mass murder could also be suicide
[3:26:31.140 --> 3:26:35.620]  We're talking serious stuff here as a result of these
[3:26:36.740 --> 3:26:42.340]  SSRI as they're called antidepressants and that's just one class of drug
[3:26:43.620 --> 3:26:45.620]  There are others called
[3:26:45.940 --> 3:26:49.060]  Major tranquilizers or neuro elliptics
[3:26:49.700 --> 3:26:52.900]  The first of which was thorazine. We all remember that one
[3:26:54.020 --> 3:26:58.580]  And we've got others like howl doll and we've got others like risk per doll
[3:26:58.580 --> 3:27:06.100]  And what are they they are creating motor brain damage
[3:27:08.420 --> 3:27:17.940]  What does that mean that means that your ability to move and function physiologically as a human being is damaged by these drugs
[3:27:19.540 --> 3:27:25.540]  The great reference on this is peter bregan's book toxic psychiatry 1991 st martin's press
[3:27:25.540 --> 3:27:27.540]  Which should be on every bookshelf
[3:27:29.540 --> 3:27:31.540]  So here you go
[3:27:32.500 --> 3:27:34.500]  U.S colleges
[3:27:36.500 --> 3:27:38.500]  Mind control
[3:27:39.540 --> 3:27:43.540]  Psychiatry is basically a mind control operation
[3:27:44.500 --> 3:27:48.500]  Diagnoses with no tests completely arbitrary
[3:27:49.540 --> 3:27:53.540]  Giving you the sense that you have a mental disorder and now you're a victim
[3:27:53.540 --> 3:27:59.620]  And therefore you have certain privileges and rights and so forth. I'm triggered. I need to save space microaggressions
[3:28:00.420 --> 3:28:02.980]  The drugs are in fact scrambling your brains
[3:28:04.980 --> 3:28:10.020]  What else do you need to say that psychiatry is a mind control program?
[3:28:10.020 --> 3:28:19.540]  It's the extension of mk ultra of the cia their famous mind control program into the entire society right out in the open
[3:28:19.540 --> 3:28:25.540]  And as alex is fond of saying they're not even trying to hide it anymore. They're just giving it to you here
[3:28:25.540 --> 3:28:29.540]  We are and this is what we're doing to you now take it
[3:28:31.540 --> 3:28:33.540]  So a
[3:28:33.540 --> 3:28:36.540]  real revolution is necessary at colleges
[3:28:37.540 --> 3:28:45.540]  Because of 25 percent of all college students in the u.s. Are being diagnosed or treated for a mental disorder
[3:28:45.540 --> 3:28:55.540]  These are nothing more than psychiatric clinics. They are little nests that produce violence and craziness and insanity
[3:28:55.540 --> 3:28:59.540]  That's why where the insanity begins
[3:28:59.540 --> 3:29:01.540]  That's where it comes up
[3:29:03.540 --> 3:29:05.540]  Okay
[3:29:05.540 --> 3:29:07.540]  We're going to take a break in a couple minutes, but I want to tell you
[3:29:09.540 --> 3:29:13.540]  After we come back from the break stay with us because
[3:29:13.540 --> 3:29:17.540]  What I'm talking about is mind control slavery over the mind
[3:29:19.540 --> 3:29:23.540]  What rob do in his report which is coming right up is talking about
[3:29:23.540 --> 3:29:25.540]  Is taking over
[3:29:25.540 --> 3:29:29.540]  Our physical world through agenda 21
[3:29:31.540 --> 3:29:35.540]  The report is called code next is slavery
[3:29:37.540 --> 3:29:39.540]  You really want to see this one because of course
[3:29:39.540 --> 3:29:41.540]  Agenda 21
[3:29:41.540 --> 3:29:45.540]  Is everywhere in the United States under a variety of disguise
[3:29:45.540 --> 3:29:47.540]  We'll be back. Stay with us
[3:29:47.540 --> 3:29:51.540]  We're on the march the empires on the run
[3:29:51.540 --> 3:29:55.540]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[3:29:59.540 --> 3:30:03.540]  We have the new product and enforce life.com bio true selenium
[3:30:03.540 --> 3:30:09.540]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a series of
[3:30:09.540 --> 3:30:15.540]  We were able to source a certified organic bio available selenium from mustard seed extract
[3:30:15.540 --> 3:30:21.540]  When you take selenium in the body it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body
[3:30:21.540 --> 3:30:25.540]  It helps balance the thyroid gland it helps detoxify
[3:30:25.540 --> 3:30:29.540]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves
[3:30:29.540 --> 3:30:33.540]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland but it's actually used all over the body
[3:30:33.540 --> 3:30:39.540]  As a matter of fact there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium
[3:30:39.540 --> 3:30:45.540]  So it really is a all around nutrient that everybody really needs
[3:30:45.540 --> 3:30:52.540]  I'm taking it now every day this is so key bio true selenium is the product the best selenium that we could bring you
[3:30:52.540 --> 3:30:56.540]  We believe it's the best out there at a very very low price exclusively available at infowarslife.com
[3:30:56.540 --> 3:31:00.540]  Or by calling toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine

[3:32:57.540 --> 3:33:15.540]  Easy affordable effective
[3:33:15.540 --> 3:33:26.540]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[3:33:26.540 --> 3:33:32.540]  For over 20 years the UN has been attempting to advance the globalist plan called Agenda 21
[3:33:32.540 --> 3:33:42.540]  Under the guise of the title sustainable development this state of regulations has been the driving force behind many of the land and business regulations passed in your local community
[3:33:42.540 --> 3:33:52.540]  Sustainable development almost always results in a community turning over its resources to a small bureaucracy through tax and regulation transfer more and more power to themselves
[3:33:52.540 --> 3:33:59.540]  While many media outlets decry Agenda 21 as a dead letter we see evidence of the implementation of this plan all the time
[3:33:59.540 --> 3:34:05.540]  In Austin Texas for example a series of land development rules called Code Next has been pushed for years
[3:34:05.540 --> 3:34:13.540]  NGOs with an interest in Agenda 21 have been producing videos which could prepare or tone the public for unnatural living scenarios
[3:34:13.540 --> 3:34:22.540]  One video in particular Plannedopolis shows a future world where everything is tracked, traced and you are only allowed meat on certain days
[3:34:22.540 --> 3:34:28.540]  What's on the menu this month? No, not meat, it's not your birthday
[3:34:28.540 --> 3:34:33.540]  The Global Food Council are doing a really good job of keeping food production going
[3:34:33.540 --> 3:34:37.540]  I mean you don't get the choice you're used to but we're better off the most
[3:34:37.540 --> 3:34:43.540]  And if you don't agree with this controlled aspect of living then you live in the ghettos and are shunned by society
[3:34:43.540 --> 3:34:45.540]  Now let's look at Code Next
[3:34:45.540 --> 3:34:47.540]  It's called Code Next
[3:34:47.540 --> 3:34:51.540]  That's the trendy name for Agenda 21 in Austin Texas
[3:34:51.540 --> 3:34:55.540]  Under their Next Code systems
[3:34:55.540 --> 3:35:05.540]  They are openly establishing a planetary system of total control
[3:35:05.540 --> 3:35:10.540]  Where the individual has absolutely no rights and where your very environment is a prison
[3:35:10.540 --> 3:35:19.540]  Look into Code Next if you want to understand the global model of Agenda 21 simply using zoning to fully enslave you and your family
[3:35:19.540 --> 3:35:28.540]  This plan begins by re-zoning already existing neighborhoods to meet a new standard that will be compatible with new future plans already outlined in Agenda 21
[3:35:28.540 --> 3:35:37.540]  Code Next wants to change existing single family housing developments and implement a new sustainable model that contains massive apartment buildings
[3:35:37.540 --> 3:35:43.540]  Some of which contain 200 square foot coffin apartments and by raising people's property taxes to unlivable standards
[3:35:43.540 --> 3:35:51.540]  People are forced to sell their homes to giant developers which can knock down say four houses in an area and put up giant high rises
[3:35:51.540 --> 3:35:57.540]  Thereby increasing the property tax base even more and crowding more and more people into smaller and smaller areas
[3:35:57.540 --> 3:35:59.540]  This also increases traffic congestion
[3:35:59.540 --> 3:36:05.540]  So Code Next also makes driving lanes smaller and even adds concrete embankments for bike lanes
[3:36:05.540 --> 3:36:08.540]  Anything to impede the natural flow of traffic
[3:36:08.540 --> 3:36:12.540]  But what's the true incentive for programs like Code Next?
[3:36:12.540 --> 3:36:18.540]  Beyond their claims of being the progressive left, the progressive left has been caught many times engaging in voter fraud
[3:36:18.540 --> 3:36:22.540]  President Obama even encouraged illegal immigrants to vote on election day
[3:36:22.540 --> 3:36:28.540]  So if I vote, will immigration know where I live? Will they come from my family and deport us?
[3:36:28.540 --> 3:36:35.540]  Not true and the reason is first of all when you vote, you are a citizen yourself
[3:36:35.540 --> 3:36:43.540]  And there is not a situation where the voting rolls somehow are transferred over and people start investigating etc
[3:36:43.540 --> 3:36:47.540]  The same to the vote is strictly confidential
[3:36:47.540 --> 3:36:54.540]  And with an abundance of cheap rooms and small coffin like apartments being built in once middle class residential communities
[3:36:54.540 --> 3:36:58.540]  You can turn conservative districts into leftist progressive districts
[3:36:58.540 --> 3:37:04.540]  They have an admitted plan under Code Next to take over Austin and take over the surrounding towns like a cancer
[3:37:04.540 --> 3:37:12.540]  Take over the I-35 and I-45 corridors and fully bring in the third world population to drive down wages
[3:37:12.540 --> 3:37:18.540]  To house them in overpriced coffin apartments and to bring down the standard of living massively
[3:37:18.540 --> 3:37:25.540]  Then use those political groups as a checkmate on the rest of the population and kill the middle class once and for all
[3:37:25.540 --> 3:37:30.540]  It affects every property owner, every runner, every everyone that lives in Austin
[3:37:30.540 --> 3:37:33.540]  Whether you live inside the city or just outside of your city limits
[3:37:33.540 --> 3:37:36.540]  Okay, he's talking about Code Next
[3:37:36.540 --> 3:37:41.540]  The code will reflect what the character of your neighborhood should look like as well as mobility options
[3:37:41.540 --> 3:37:47.540]  We talk to Habitat for Humanity and right now they are waiting to develop this old lumber yard on East 4th Street
[3:37:47.540 --> 3:37:50.540]  It's just a block or so away from the metro rail station
[3:37:50.540 --> 3:37:57.540]  They believe the rewriting of the code will allow them to build more affordable units instead of just single family homes
[3:37:57.540 --> 3:38:00.540]  The bureaucrats win by creating a vertical property tax base
[3:38:00.540 --> 3:38:03.540]  Instead of one house paying one set of property taxes
[3:38:03.540 --> 3:38:08.540]  You now have 400 little apartments all paying tax on the same piece of property
[3:38:08.540 --> 3:38:12.540]  Breaking apart residential communities and adding small rent controlled efficiency apartments
[3:38:12.540 --> 3:38:16.540]  Popularly known as the Projects can have serious effects on a community as well
[3:38:16.540 --> 3:38:23.540]  Will a neighborhood of primarily single family dwellings be subject to increased crime rates that we see in sanctuary cities across the nation
[3:38:23.540 --> 3:38:25.540]  This is obviously a disaster waiting to happen
[3:38:25.540 --> 3:38:28.540]  Through Agenda 21 and its manifestations like Code Next
[3:38:28.540 --> 3:38:31.540]  We can see the dark cloud of sustainable development consuming us all
[3:38:31.540 --> 3:38:39.540]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News
[3:38:39.540 --> 3:38:46.540]  John Rapp report back so you saw that terrific report by Rob
[3:38:46.540 --> 3:38:50.540]  So now think of this in relation to what I've been talking about
[3:38:50.540 --> 3:38:56.540]  Now you're going to have people desperate, more desperate and more desperate
[3:38:56.540 --> 3:39:01.540]  And somebody's going to say well you should really see somebody
[3:39:01.540 --> 3:39:05.540]  You should talk to a professional
[3:39:05.540 --> 3:39:06.540]  Right?
[3:39:06.540 --> 3:39:10.540]  Oh it's not what's happening outside in the world that has nothing to do with it
[3:39:10.540 --> 3:39:14.540]  No it's something you know inside your brain
[3:39:14.540 --> 3:39:19.540]  Get diagnosed in other words why don't they just come out and say hey get diagnosed
[3:39:19.540 --> 3:39:20.540]  What do you say?
[3:39:20.540 --> 3:39:25.540]  Join the crowd everybody loves it we're all getting diagnosed this week
[3:39:25.540 --> 3:39:27.540]  This is diagnosis week
[3:39:27.540 --> 3:39:33.540]  Barack Obama has come out of retirement along with Bill Clinton a skeletal figure
[3:39:33.540 --> 3:39:38.540]  And they're all saying along with Hillary Clinton it takes a village to get diagnosed
[3:39:38.540 --> 3:39:43.540]  Let's all get diagnosed this week this is diagnosis week for mental disorders
[3:39:43.540 --> 3:39:48.540]  The entire population because now that we're stuffing you into tiny spaces
[3:39:48.540 --> 3:39:52.540]  And making you exceedingly claustrophobic and taking away all your money
[3:39:52.540 --> 3:39:59.540]  And destroying the middle class and basically you know gutting the nation
[3:39:59.540 --> 3:40:02.540]  It's time to get diagnosed folks
[3:40:02.540 --> 3:40:10.540]  It really takes a village to get diagnosed yeah that's the truth
[3:40:10.540 --> 3:40:17.540]  It takes a village mentality a global village mentality to get diagnosed
[3:40:17.540 --> 3:40:26.540]  Yeah so mind blowing I'm going to try to raise a document up here for myself
[3:40:26.540 --> 3:40:30.540]  You will not see it hopefully okay we're still here
[3:40:30.540 --> 3:40:36.540]  I'm your basic primitive writer okay
[3:40:36.540 --> 3:40:43.540]  I want to read you a short passage from Peter Brigham's 1991 book toxic psychiatry
[3:40:43.540 --> 3:40:45.540]  This is a revelation okay
[3:40:45.540 --> 3:40:48.540]  I'm going to excerpt this a little bit
[3:40:48.540 --> 3:40:53.540]  Pseudonym, Roberta was a college student getting good grades mostly A's
[3:40:53.540 --> 3:41:00.540]  When she first became depressed and sought psychiatric help with the recommendation of her university health service right
[3:41:00.540 --> 3:41:02.540]  Talk about agenda 21
[3:41:02.540 --> 3:41:06.540]  She was 18 at the time, bright and well motivated, very good candidate
[3:41:06.540 --> 3:41:15.540]  Bob-a-Bots et cetera et cetera going through a sophomore year identity crisis about dating men succeeding in school planning a future
[3:41:15.540 --> 3:41:21.540]  Okay instead of moral support and insight her doctor gave her Haldol
[3:41:21.540 --> 3:41:28.540]  That's an anti-psychotic that is a neuro elliptic a major tranquilizer
[3:41:28.540 --> 3:41:31.540]  Those are all names for that class of drugs over the next four years
[3:41:31.540 --> 3:41:33.540]  Get this now listen
[3:41:33.540 --> 3:41:43.540]  Six different physicians watched her deteriorate neurologically without warning her or her family about tar-dive dyskinesia motor brain damage
[3:41:43.540 --> 3:41:47.540]  And without making the diagnosis
[3:41:47.540 --> 3:41:53.540]  Even when she was overtly twitching in her arms and legs instead they switched her from one neuro elliptic to another
[3:41:53.540 --> 3:41:57.540]  Including Navain, Stelazine and Thorazine
[3:41:57.540 --> 3:42:06.540]  Eventually a rehabilitation therapist became concerned enough to send her to a general physician who made the diagnosis of medical drug damage
[3:42:06.540 --> 3:42:13.540]  By then she was permanently physically disabled with a loss of 30% of her IQ
[3:42:13.540 --> 3:42:18.540]  And then Bregan says my medical evaluation described her condition
[3:42:18.540 --> 3:42:24.540]  Grossly disfigured and severely disabled human being who can no longer control her body
[3:42:24.540 --> 3:42:33.540]  She suffers from extreme writhing movements and spathems involving the face, neck, head, shoulders, limbs, extremities, torso and back
[3:42:33.540 --> 3:42:35.540]  Nearly the entire body
[3:42:35.540 --> 3:42:43.540]  She has had difficulty standing, sitting or lying down and the difficulty is worsened as she attempts to carry out voluntary actions
[3:42:43.540 --> 3:42:48.540]  At one point she could not prevent her head from banging against nearby furniture
[3:42:48.540 --> 3:42:53.540]  She could hold a lip to her cup only with great difficulty etc etc
[3:42:53.540 --> 3:43:02.540]  Even her respiratory movements are seriously afflicted so that her speech comes out in grunts and gasts amidst spathems
[3:43:02.540 --> 3:43:07.540]  Roberta may improve somewhat after several months off the neuro elliptic drugs
[3:43:07.540 --> 3:43:13.540]  But she will never again have anything remotely resembling a normal life
[3:43:15.540 --> 3:43:17.540]  Yeah, okay
[3:43:17.540 --> 3:43:19.540]  Get it?
[3:43:19.540 --> 3:43:21.540]  Get it?
[3:43:21.540 --> 3:43:27.540]  Now Bregan warns and I want you to make sure you understand
[3:43:27.540 --> 3:43:35.540]  Withdrawing rapidly from any psychiatric drug can be worse than taking the drug
[3:43:35.540 --> 3:43:41.540]  We're talking about very dangerous and even life-threatening problems
[3:43:41.540 --> 3:43:48.540]  So this is in no way a recommendation to anybody who may be on one of these drugs to just get off of it
[3:43:48.540 --> 3:43:55.540]  Bregan.com is the website of Peter Bregan
[3:43:55.540 --> 3:43:59.540]  He's written a book about withdrawing from psychiatric drugs
[3:43:59.540 --> 3:44:05.540]  He recommends it be done by a professional who knows what he's doing etc
[3:44:05.540 --> 3:44:07.540]  Okay
[3:44:07.540 --> 3:44:17.540]  So I think you're probably getting the message now in this investigative report on the number one mind control program at colleges
[3:44:17.540 --> 3:44:23.540]  And now I want to talk about super blue fluoride free toothpaste
[3:44:23.540 --> 3:44:27.540]  My wife read about this she was very enthusiastic
[3:44:27.540 --> 3:44:33.540]  After being sold out for months at inforwarslife.com it's back
[3:44:33.540 --> 3:44:41.540]  Gums research indicates contribute to the development can contribute to the development of heart disease heart attacks
[3:44:41.540 --> 3:44:49.540]  When bacteria infect your gums it can enter the bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots or heart attacks
[3:44:49.540 --> 3:44:57.540]  That's why the latest Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body
[3:44:57.540 --> 3:45:04.540]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste, groundbreaking new formula
[3:45:04.540 --> 3:45:20.540]  Good halogen iodine instead of bad halogen fluoride contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath
[3:45:20.540 --> 3:45:35.540]  Xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver are just some of the ingredients
[3:45:35.540 --> 3:45:48.540]  You understand what the situation is here folks from what I've been detailing in this investigative report and from what Rob do is talking about
[3:45:48.540 --> 3:45:52.540]  You are the resistance, we are the resistance
[3:45:52.540 --> 3:45:59.540]  Here's a way you can support inforwars and also get a terrific product for your health
[3:45:59.540 --> 3:46:06.540]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste inforwarslife.com
[3:46:06.540 --> 3:46:17.540]  Okay, what else on this merry voyage through insanity created by psychiatry
[3:46:17.540 --> 3:46:32.540]  You'll see in the article that I wrote about this up at Infowars and also at No More Fake News that even drugs like Ritalin can have fantastically dangerous effects
[3:46:32.540 --> 3:46:39.540]  Psychotic breaks, aggressive violent behavior
[3:46:39.540 --> 3:46:49.540]  And to think about this, this so-called ADHD everybody's getting it, get diagnosed, get the drug, sure
[3:46:49.540 --> 3:46:58.540]  The drugs are very, very closely related to amphetamines
[3:46:58.540 --> 3:47:03.540]  They are amphetamine type drugs
[3:47:03.540 --> 3:47:13.540]  The boys at Infowars now have it up on the screen as some of the effects of Ritalin, paranoid delusions, paranoid psychosis, visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations
[3:47:13.540 --> 3:47:19.540]  Can surpass LSD in producing bizarre experiences
[3:47:19.540 --> 3:47:26.540]  Extreme withdrawal, started screaming, aggressiveness, insomnia
[3:47:26.540 --> 3:47:37.540]  Decreased REM sleep, on and on and on, hypertension, seizures, convulsions
[3:47:37.540 --> 3:47:51.540]  Everybody knows, who's familiar with amphetamine type drugs, that if you take them for a certain length of time, after the initial, wow, wears off like boy, I've got increased clarity
[3:47:51.540 --> 3:48:06.540]  Terrific, I can study and so on and so on, an evening out occurs, a crash occurs in many people, they crash, a speed crash is what they used to call it on the street
[3:48:06.540 --> 3:48:14.540]  Now the person is in fantastically bad shape, huddling in a corner
[3:48:14.540 --> 3:48:24.540]  Instead of a child, in that situation, or a college student, back to the psychiatrist, what does the psychiatrist say?
[3:48:24.540 --> 3:48:34.540]  Well, from what you're saying here, it's obvious to me, that you are really suffering from clinical depression now
[3:48:34.540 --> 3:48:36.540]  Really doctor, yeah
[3:48:36.540 --> 3:48:45.540]  Well, I mean, I'm assuming that's related to the drug that you gave me for ADHD, of course not, no, where did you get that idea?
[3:48:45.540 --> 3:48:58.540]  There couldn't be any relationship to the drug for ADHD, no, this is the emergence of a new condition, clinical depression, and so I'm going to put you on Zoloft
[3:48:58.540 --> 3:49:08.540]  And now the circus moves into phase two, the brain destroying, mind destroying circus moves into phase two
[3:49:08.540 --> 3:49:16.540]  Because now what we're talking about here is the person, the child, the student is in the system
[3:49:16.540 --> 3:49:30.540]  And I'll give you a potential phase three, Ritalin, SSRI antidepressant, up, down, up, down, back to the psychiatrist
[3:49:30.540 --> 3:49:37.540]  Well, says the psychiatrist in his jolly frame of mind
[3:49:37.540 --> 3:49:46.540]  What I'm now seeing actually coming out behind all of this is bipolar, that's what's going on here, bipolar
[3:49:46.540 --> 3:49:52.540]  The up, the down, what we used to call old manic depression, you have your ups and you have your downs
[3:49:52.540 --> 3:49:58.540]  You're sure doctor that this is not connected to any of the drugs I've been taking because it really seems like it is
[3:49:58.540 --> 3:50:04.540]  Listen, I'm the professional here, where did you get such an idea?
[3:50:04.540 --> 3:50:08.540]  You must have been reading some crazy stuff somewhere
[3:50:08.540 --> 3:50:16.540]  We're talking about mental disorders and the medicines used to treat them here, I'm the pro
[3:50:16.540 --> 3:50:27.540]  So now we get into valproate and we get into depacote, these are much heavier drugs with much heavier potential effects
[3:50:27.540 --> 3:50:38.540]  And the circus goes on, and as I read you, that excerpt from toxic psychiatry about the student named Herberta
[3:50:38.540 --> 3:50:48.540]  This could very well be the outcome, and if it's not the outcome, you've got kids at colleges going all over the place
[3:50:48.540 --> 3:50:53.540]  Doing all kinds of bizarre things
[3:50:53.540 --> 3:50:58.540]  Stay with us, we'll right there, back after the break

[3:53:07.540 --> 3:53:10.540]  Blood sugar levels and had a sense of well-being overall
[3:53:10.540 --> 3:53:13.540]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives
[3:53:13.540 --> 3:53:14.540]  And you could be one of them
[3:53:14.540 --> 3:53:16.540]  It's called Heart and Body Extract
[3:53:16.540 --> 3:53:19.540]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract
[3:53:19.540 --> 3:53:22.540]  Talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract
[3:53:22.540 --> 3:53:25.540]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract
[3:53:25.540 --> 3:53:30.540]  Is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes and phytonutrients
[3:53:30.540 --> 3:53:32.540]  So the body will heal itself
[3:53:32.540 --> 3:53:35.540]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure
[3:53:35.540 --> 3:53:38.540]  Balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries
[3:53:38.540 --> 3:53:42.540]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetic
[3:53:42.540 --> 3:53:44.540]  So the body is an amazing thing
[3:53:44.540 --> 3:53:47.540]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself
[3:53:47.540 --> 3:53:49.540]  Heart and Body Extract gets results

[3:54:25.540 --> 3:54:30.540]  The smallest level is 12 miles from shore to shore
[3:54:30.540 --> 3:54:38.540]  And at the smallest level or smallest location
[3:54:38.540 --> 3:54:47.540]  It's 7 miles between one shore and the other
[3:54:47.540 --> 3:54:49.540]  Is that correct?
[3:54:49.540 --> 3:54:51.540]  I don't have the exact dimensions
[3:54:51.540 --> 3:54:54.540]  But to your point, sir, I think Guam is a small island
[3:54:54.540 --> 3:55:03.540]  My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated
[3:55:03.540 --> 3:55:08.540]  That it will tip over and capsize
[3:55:15.540 --> 3:55:17.540]  I stand here as a freed slave
[3:55:17.540 --> 3:55:19.540]  We've seen nothing that we can work
[3:55:19.540 --> 3:55:22.540]  But I can work with President Bush on
[3:55:22.540 --> 3:55:25.540]  And I'm disappointed because I thought that there might be
[3:55:25.540 --> 3:55:29.540]  Some interest because of what he said in the campaign
[3:55:29.540 --> 3:55:31.540]  What are we going to do?
[3:55:31.540 --> 3:55:37.540]  How can a president who is acting in the manner that he's acting
[3:55:37.540 --> 3:55:40.540]  Whether he's talking about the travel ban
[3:55:40.540 --> 3:55:42.540]  The way that he's targeting Muslims
[3:55:42.540 --> 3:55:45.540]  Or whether he's talking about his relationship to Putin
[3:55:45.540 --> 3:55:49.540]  And the Kremlin and knowing that they have hacked
[3:55:49.540 --> 3:55:53.540]  Our DCCC and DNC
[3:55:53.540 --> 3:55:59.540]  And knowing that he is responsible for supplying the bombs
[3:55:59.540 --> 3:56:04.540]  That killed innocent children and families in...
[3:56:04.540 --> 3:56:06.540]  What is Aleppo?
[3:56:06.540 --> 3:56:08.540]  Yeah, in Aleppo
[3:56:11.540 --> 3:56:13.540]  You are correct
[3:56:13.540 --> 3:56:16.540]  Way to go
[3:56:16.540 --> 3:56:20.540]  The fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin
[3:56:20.540 --> 3:56:27.540]  While Putin is continuing to advance into Korea
[3:56:36.540 --> 3:56:37.540]  Okay
[3:56:37.540 --> 3:56:40.540]  So I think now we need to find out how many people
[3:56:40.540 --> 3:56:44.540]  In Congress are on psychiatric drugs after watching that
[3:56:44.540 --> 3:56:46.540]  I think that's the next step
[3:56:46.540 --> 3:56:51.540]  Because you're not making any sense
[3:56:51.540 --> 3:56:54.540]  We are nearing the end of this hour
[3:56:54.540 --> 3:56:58.540]  Takeaways
[3:56:58.540 --> 3:57:03.540]  The number one mind control program at U.S. colleges is psychiatry
[3:57:03.540 --> 3:57:07.540]  25% of all college students in the U.S.
[3:57:07.540 --> 3:57:12.540]  Have either been diagnosed or treated for mental disorder
[3:57:12.540 --> 3:57:15.540]  This explains the microaggression thing
[3:57:15.540 --> 3:57:17.540]  And the triggering thing and the home thing
[3:57:17.540 --> 3:57:19.540]  And safe space and all of that
[3:57:19.540 --> 3:57:22.540]  It's a combination of I'm a victim
[3:57:22.540 --> 3:57:25.540]  So I can just be victimized by anything
[3:57:25.540 --> 3:57:28.540]  It's a new world, I've got a new role to play
[3:57:28.540 --> 3:57:30.540]  In the grand scheme
[3:57:30.540 --> 3:57:34.540]  Or and it's the effects of the psychiatric drugs
[3:57:34.540 --> 3:57:38.540]  Scrambling brain chemistry that make kids do
[3:57:38.540 --> 3:57:42.540]  And say the strangest things
[3:57:42.540 --> 3:57:46.540]  As they're developing brain damage
[3:57:46.540 --> 3:57:49.540]  As they're developing brain damage
[3:57:49.540 --> 3:57:51.540]  Not kidding around here folks
[3:57:51.540 --> 3:57:54.540]  It's chemical warfare
[3:57:54.540 --> 3:57:58.540]  It is sustained year by year
[3:57:58.540 --> 3:58:00.540]  Generation by generation now
[3:58:00.540 --> 3:58:03.540]  With psychiatry holding a kind of virtual monopoly
[3:58:03.540 --> 3:58:07.540]  Backed up by the federal government on mental health
[3:58:07.540 --> 3:58:10.540]  That's where we're at
[3:58:10.540 --> 3:58:14.540]  And this has to be thrown over
[3:58:14.540 --> 3:58:15.540]  Throne over
[3:58:15.540 --> 3:58:17.540]  Thanks John Rappaport here
[3:58:17.540 --> 3:58:39.540]  See you next time
