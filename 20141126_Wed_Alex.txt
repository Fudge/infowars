[00:00.000 --> 00:13.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.120 --> 00:21.920]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.920 --> 00:29.720]  absolutely no doubt now things in Ferguson in the rest of the country are going
[00:29.720 --> 00:37.720]  exactly as we predicted they would if this was indeed a scion again the police
[00:37.720 --> 00:44.000]  the military that are out there getting shot at and attacked are not to blame in
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.680]  this because they're compartmentalized just like the public this is a plan to
[00:48.680 --> 00:53.920]  demonize the First Amendment and to legitimize the globalization federalization
[00:53.920 --> 00:58.400]  of the National Stability Police Force that the Rand Corporation has been
[00:58.400 --> 01:07.520]  promoting and now we have a top general coming out on CNN last night calling for
[01:07.520 --> 01:16.720]  regular army on the streets all over the United States so you have the police
[01:16.720 --> 01:22.880]  stand down under federal control when this starts and go after reporters
[01:22.880 --> 01:28.080]  instead months ago and then they basically stand down again and then you
[01:28.080 --> 01:36.240]  have to bring in even more force and you've got these idiot agitators and
[01:36.240 --> 01:41.520]  then you've got worse criminals and what I've called terrorist running around
[01:41.520 --> 01:46.700]  exacerbating the situation as pawns in the game and one of our reporters
[01:46.700 --> 01:51.160]  Chicago Jackson last night got threatened by a masked thug who says I guess he
[01:51.160 --> 01:58.120]  watches and listens to the show said I'll show you terrorist I said see see
[01:58.120 --> 02:03.160]  that's a straw man we're not saying demonstrators are terrorists we're
[02:03.160 --> 02:09.640]  saying people shooting at firefighters trying to put houses and churches out
[02:09.640 --> 02:17.160]  like mr. Brown's church that got burned down when you for pure fear and
[02:17.160 --> 02:23.600]  intimidation shoot at people two FBI agents have been shot two cops have been
[02:23.600 --> 02:29.720]  shot an innocent man was killed in his car burned down a bunch of stuff the
[02:29.720 --> 02:36.560]  people doing that are engaged in terrorism it's a terroristic threat to
[02:36.560 --> 02:43.080]  come up and terrorize somebody and say I'll show you and menace them now I'm
[02:43.080 --> 02:47.720]  the one that basically from day one began fighting the police state and
[02:47.720 --> 02:54.760]  fighting the globalization the tyranny the armored vehicles but there's another
[02:54.760 --> 03:04.480]  end to that game we can't be played off against the police into a civil war and
[03:04.480 --> 03:07.880]  I just don't know people are smart enough or sophisticated enough to
[03:07.880 --> 03:16.560]  understand this for to me this is incredibly simple if the American
[03:16.560 --> 03:20.520]  people can be played off against the police the globalist win and a lot of
[03:20.520 --> 03:27.040]  citizens are gonna die a lot of police are gonna die and then when they're done
[03:27.040 --> 03:30.920]  setting up a national police force it's already in place but rolling it out
[03:30.920 --> 03:35.680]  they're gonna flip it on to gun owners and veterans the real enemy of the
[03:35.680 --> 03:46.120]  globalist by the way four months ago on July 17th US Army training to fight
[03:46.120 --> 03:51.400]  black Americans doomsday Disneyland facility uses practice ground for
[03:51.400 --> 03:56.560]  civil unrest Paul Joseph Watson with a special video emergency report I
[03:56.560 --> 04:01.440]  issued saying they're preparing for race war in America and for the media to
[04:01.440 --> 04:10.080]  stir up incidents to cause mass rioting and the regular army which now on CNN
[04:10.080 --> 04:14.120]  effect I had at the stack and I can't find it reprint me the headline
[04:14.120 --> 04:20.920]  general calls for regular army on streets so to try to find it thank you is
[04:20.920 --> 04:25.240]  now saying that so let me tell you who's to blame here it's the National
[04:25.240 --> 04:32.000]  Security Council it's the United Nations it's President Obama it's the
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.600]  people running North cop are trying to condition us to accept martial law in

[09:37.600 --> 09:43.320]  collapsing to use the tragic death of a young black man to try to create race

[10:49.800 --> 10:54.800]  Ferguson situation was even on a radar screen before the media picked it
[10:54.800 --> 10:58.720]  there's a lot of examples of police shooting innocent black men and women
[10:58.720 --> 11:02.680]  there are a lot of examples of shooting hispanics whites or other cops I mean
[11:02.680 --> 11:09.840]  there's bad cops out of there out of two million police remain a half but they
[11:09.840 --> 11:13.920]  picked one where the guy was a thug the evidence is overwhelming where the cop
[11:13.920 --> 11:18.280]  told the truth the evidence is overwhelming show that they could make
[11:18.280 --> 11:23.720]  all the people that came out and protested look like fools especially when
[11:23.720 --> 11:28.760]  they injected a bunch of provocateurs in there and had the media hyped the whole
[11:28.760 --> 11:34.240]  thing three dead and 15 wounded in weekend shootings in Chicago alone
[11:34.240 --> 11:37.680]  almost everyone of them black on black you're not gonna see a bunch of people
[11:37.680 --> 11:43.720]  out there protesting and demonstrating that you're not gonna hear the black
[11:43.720 --> 11:48.320]  community that's controlled by the globalist clearly saying hey we don't
[11:48.320 --> 11:52.440]  like gangster rap and all these things that are preparing our young men for

[12:06.000 --> 12:11.640]  off against each other I saw a lot of comments on info wars dot com and
[12:11.640 --> 12:18.360]  prison planet dot com last night in this morning saying how dare you Alex Jones
[12:18.360 --> 12:23.200]  Sabbath the police how dare you you know not support the demonstrators let me
[12:23.200 --> 12:28.160]  explain something not because I care about criticism but so you you can get
[12:28.160 --> 12:31.480]  it straight in your mind and not be ignorant and not be fooled anymore
[12:31.480 --> 12:35.440]  because I'm all about exposing the rabbit trick I'm all about exposing how
[12:35.440 --> 12:39.400]  this thing works that's how we're gonna be free is discovering the scams and the
[12:39.400 --> 12:45.360]  frauds and not being a bunch of chumps all I've called for is not having a
[12:45.360 --> 12:49.800]  civil war all I've called for is not having a race war I've predicted all of
[12:49.800 --> 12:55.000]  this they're trying to do this you could watch MSNBC every night and see the
[12:55.000 --> 12:58.760]  race baiting and see what they were doing it's as clear as the nose on my
[12:58.760 --> 13:09.000]  face or your face I am sick of when I'm against turning my guns in me and
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.120]  called a racist or I don't support Obama carries it has death panels and
[13:12.120 --> 13:17.960]  increases everybody's rates and taxes poor people I'm called a racist and when
[13:17.960 --> 13:22.040]  I don't support people out there quote demonstrating because they're burning
[13:22.040 --> 13:27.560]  and shooting people then I'm a racist again let me explain something when
[13:27.560 --> 13:34.160]  people accuse me of that I don't care because I love you and want you to be
[13:34.160 --> 13:37.840]  successful and want you to win and don't want fluoride in your water to
[13:37.840 --> 13:42.240]  brain damage you and lower your IQ and and and don't want you drinking high
[13:42.240 --> 13:46.120]  fructose corn syrup and don't want your kids eating GMO that kills the honey
[13:46.120 --> 13:52.600]  bees that eat it and I don't care what color you are I don't think in those
[13:52.600 --> 13:56.080]  terms as a default
[13:59.920 --> 14:03.280]  the Trayvon Martin thing had been going on I'm gonna give it all the latest news
[14:03.280 --> 14:06.840]  on Ferguson but but but the way this affects M4 wars in myself is a
[14:06.840 --> 14:10.840]  microcosm of everything else so I'm gonna get into it right now Trayvon
[14:10.840 --> 14:17.360]  Martin verdict had just come out we have a huge black audience that listens to
[14:17.360 --> 14:24.840]  the show have a huge audience period no matter what color you are and I had said
[14:24.840 --> 14:28.440]  the whole thing was a psi opposite up with the Justice Department and that
[14:28.440 --> 14:31.960]  clearly Zimmerman was an idiot and he's been proven to be an idiot now but that
[14:31.960 --> 14:34.320]  he was getting his head slamming the ground according to multiple witnesses
[14:34.320 --> 14:38.400]  two of them black and he feared for his life so he shot Trayvon Martin was that
[14:38.400 --> 14:43.240]  a good thing no but you can you can you can get no billed by grand jury or you
[14:43.240 --> 14:47.120]  can get found not guilty by jury when there's those circumstances it means
[14:47.120 --> 14:50.760]  there's reasonable doubt and suddenly I had a lot of my black listeners mad at
[14:50.760 --> 14:55.520]  me I don't care I know I've got integrity and so believe whatever you want
[14:55.520 --> 14:59.960]  and so that black lady I forget her name poor lady with her kid in the back
[14:59.960 --> 15:04.960]  was driving around DC runs to an army checkpoint during a drill they tell her
[15:04.960 --> 15:09.140]  pull over she's gets scared like any normal person drives off and they
[15:09.140 --> 15:15.440]  shoot her dead black and white cops shoot her dead and in the hour that chase
[15:15.440 --> 15:19.640]  was going on we didn't know what color she was and the hours it took for the
[15:19.640 --> 15:24.080]  news came out I said this is horrible that they killed this woman and I saw
[15:24.080 --> 15:27.480]  comments all over YouTube and info wars going how dare you you racist piece of
[15:27.480 --> 15:32.280]  garbage you only care because it's a white woman her race wasn't known I
[15:32.280 --> 15:37.680]  didn't think what colors this woman that just got executed by the police like
[15:37.680 --> 15:43.640]  their checkpoint Charlie and Berlin or something East Berlin I just thought I
[15:43.640 --> 15:47.520]  saw a woman being chased in a car we didn't know what color she was all we
[15:47.520 --> 15:50.720]  could see she had dark hair I was against her being killed and suddenly
[15:50.720 --> 15:55.160]  there was all this outpouring we apologize you care you're not racist
[15:55.160 --> 16:00.240]  you're mad they killed a black lady well of course I'm mad they killed an
[16:00.240 --> 16:06.560]  innocent black woman then Congress gave a standing ovation of the DC cops that
[16:06.560 --> 16:11.000]  cowardly shot her when she wasn't endangering anybody when they executed
[16:11.000 --> 16:18.120]  her and neocon radio praised her execution Michael Savage didn't he's the
[16:18.120 --> 16:22.280]  only other talks of us that saw how sick it was George Norrie didn't think it was
[16:22.280 --> 16:28.960]  good either but he's not so much political so see that just shows see I
[16:28.960 --> 16:33.040]  think like Martin Luther King did where I'm not looking at what color you are
[16:33.040 --> 16:37.600]  first I will look at how you're dressed and what you're driving though I tell
[16:37.600 --> 16:41.080]  you that'll tell you a lot more I walk out of some restaurant my kids and
[16:41.080 --> 16:44.080]  there's some guys that look like they're a criminal motorcycle gang and they're
[16:44.080 --> 16:46.760]  bugging their eyes out at me and rubbing their motorcycles and they're all
[16:46.760 --> 16:52.600]  white I immediately start getting ready if one of them tries to rob me or
[16:52.600 --> 16:57.040]  assault me to defend myself and my family the same thing I see black guys
[16:57.040 --> 17:00.840]  dressed like thugs acting like thugs and kind of bowing up a little bit me at a
[17:00.840 --> 17:03.800]  gas station I'll sit there and start bowing up at them and going over my
[17:03.800 --> 17:07.680]  car where I got a gun let me tell you they cuz they're black it's cuz they
[17:07.680 --> 17:13.280]  look and act like thugs and I don't like white thugs and I don't like black
[17:13.280 --> 17:17.480]  thugs and I don't like Mexican thugs I'm sick of thugs let me tell you
[17:17.480 --> 17:20.960]  something else I don't like cops in some cities I've been in that look and act
[17:20.960 --> 17:26.600]  like thugs either you see you can get thugs in uniform you can get thugs in
[17:26.600 --> 17:32.520]  black skin white skin yellow skin brown skin I don't care you can get thugs in
[17:32.520 --> 17:39.440]  any color of the rainbow and I don't like them tyranny is government by thugs
[17:39.440 --> 17:43.680]  when you had that black EMT pulled over by a bunch of white officers in
[17:43.680 --> 17:47.480]  Oklahoma a few years ago I was one of the first to cry it pulling over the
[17:47.480 --> 17:52.040]  ambulance choking the black guy getting in his face telling him do
[17:52.040 --> 17:59.880]  something I said what a bunch of cowards need to be fired I wouldn't look
[17:59.880 --> 18:04.200]  at what color that EMT was but I think there was something racial going on

[24:21.600 --> 24:29.040]  coast that is government globalist run CNN on record CIA Department of Defense
[24:29.040 --> 24:34.840]  running it look it up just type in CNN run by secret Pentagon team you'll get
[24:34.840 --> 24:40.640]  Washington Post I mean I'm not just saying that remember Gauravadal before
[24:40.640 --> 24:43.880]  he died when on CNN once he said this is amazing this is the first time I've been
[24:43.880 --> 24:48.360]  on CNN in years where there wasn't an army general standing behind them
[24:48.360 --> 24:53.560]  telling the the person I'm debating during the breaks what to say because
[24:53.560 --> 25:00.800]  that goes on well now they've just moved on to Psyop the NFL and ESPN because
[25:00.800 --> 25:04.480]  there's no audience for the news the larger job was to discredit U.S.
[25:04.480 --> 25:09.640]  journalism by infiltrating it and turning it into state run to destroy it
[25:09.640 --> 25:15.240]  they're scared of big institutions with investigative journalist now they're
[25:15.240 --> 25:21.240]  moving into the internet to kill it as well now again our military is the hope
[25:21.240 --> 25:25.680]  but also the doom it's up to us that the military is very awake because they're
[25:25.680 --> 25:31.760]  now aware of the Psyop they've been decompartmentalized same thing with the
[25:31.760 --> 25:35.440]  police in many cases that's why we don't want to make them our enemy it's
[25:35.440 --> 25:39.680]  pointless they're Americans too we have to say no we're aware of the Rand
[25:39.680 --> 25:44.960]  corporation plan we're aware of the national stability force we're aware of
[25:44.960 --> 25:50.080]  the fascist takeover program to use socialism as a control system then it's
[25:50.080 --> 25:55.120]  came over so you've got CNN and MSNBC everybody fanning the flames of this
[25:55.120 --> 26:00.600]  over a guy strong arming a convenience store minutes before he shot witnesses
[26:00.600 --> 26:06.800]  and he attacked the cop ran back charge him again is it excessive force I mean
[26:06.800 --> 26:10.520]  I've gotten the point 40 years old I could fight pretty good but you know
[26:10.520 --> 26:14.040]  somebody has taxed me in a parking lot I'm just gonna start attacking me I'm
[26:14.040 --> 26:16.280]  gonna try to get my car and get away from they start knocking the window I'm
[26:16.280 --> 26:23.440]  just gonna shoot them I don't have to sit there and roll over and die and you
[26:23.440 --> 26:27.120]  know if a black guy's being attacked by a white guy for no reason shoot him I
[26:27.120 --> 26:35.240]  mean it's it's real simple so now we have the grand jury documents and the
[26:35.240 --> 26:38.520]  witnesses are telling the grand jury black witnesses are telling them that
[26:38.520 --> 26:44.360]  you know brown attack the cop basically who knows that might not be true the
[26:44.360 --> 26:48.880]  point is why is this the big hype because the country is being sucked
[26:48.880 --> 26:53.000]  dry by foreign banks the country is being taken over by the globalist and
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.760]  they want us fighting with each other while they open the borders while they
[26:56.760 --> 27:00.920]  raise the taxes while Obamacare goes through while the UN gun treaty goes
[27:00.920 --> 27:05.120]  in let me tell you the riots get bad enough they're trying to start it's
[27:05.120 --> 27:09.160]  like a fire though they've just got small flames going right now in the
[27:09.160 --> 27:13.160]  aggregate historically compared to the riots the Watts riots and things of the
[27:13.160 --> 27:19.280]  60s and things like that and the 92 riot but they could really go whole hog
[27:19.280 --> 27:22.320]  here and it could really explode remember what Henry Kissinger said at
[27:22.320 --> 27:30.680]  Bilderberg in 2001 or was it 1991 going for memory he said hey Americans would
[27:30.680 --> 27:34.040]  never accept you and peacekeepers in Los Angeles unless there was a big enough
[27:34.040 --> 27:38.800]  crisis and then they would beg for their global government to come and occupy
[27:38.800 --> 27:47.480]  them so remember we told you this was coming and that Obama's in game his
[27:47.480 --> 27:52.560]  last two years in office would be to invoke racial division and racial
[27:52.560 --> 27:55.880]  animus to bring in the police state to legitimize military equipment to the
[27:55.880 --> 28:00.160]  police while at the same time getting the Democratic Party more into a racial
[28:00.160 --> 28:06.880]  base system to not even care if black unemployment doubles under Obama at
[28:06.880 --> 28:11.000]  least they can go out and hate white people because the poor white person
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.960]  living down the street they did it or the poor white woman who's a manager at
[28:14.960 --> 28:19.360]  Papa John's probably getting $12 an hour came out with her bare hands we have
[28:19.360 --> 28:25.120]  video of that and fought off men with her bare hands why didn't the managers
[28:25.120 --> 28:31.800]  give her a gun if she's gonna stay there and defend the Papa John's I mean you
[28:31.800 --> 28:39.200]  gotta love this country where it's women fighting thugs off while the police
[28:39.200 --> 28:48.800]  stand down I mean it is just simply ridiculous that we've turned into this
[28:48.800 --> 28:53.120]  as the police stand down yeah I mean there's the black guys yelling at the
[28:53.120 --> 28:58.560]  poor white woman getting interface as if a woman getting $12 an hour at Papa
[28:58.560 --> 29:06.120]  John's is exploiting the black community in there making pizzas and he
[29:06.120 --> 29:10.080]  starts kicking the window in hits the woman and then she pushes them back I
[29:10.080 --> 29:14.560]  mean what tough guys let me tell you what my daughters or family would do pull
[29:14.560 --> 29:18.520]  a revolver out shove it in your chest start pulling the trigger that's called
[29:18.520 --> 29:23.280]  real feminine empowerment the women in my family you assault them they don't
[29:23.280 --> 29:27.240]  fistfight you they pull a gun out they pump it into you and then everybody can
[29:27.240 --> 29:34.400]  cry go oh my gosh she didn't let the thugs attack her she's racist no people
[29:34.400 --> 29:37.800]  are sick of it just because you're white doesn't mean you deserve to have your
[29:37.800 --> 29:41.200]  head caved in like Reginald Denny or if you're black you don't deserve to have
[29:41.200 --> 29:47.000]  the clan drag you behind a car the same thing I'm sick of it we'll be right back

[33:29.720 --> 33:37.200]  war on for your mind if I see two white men on a video slapping around and
[33:37.200 --> 33:43.400]  trying to beat up a black woman I get mad and hate them if I see two black men
[33:43.400 --> 33:48.240]  beating up a white woman for no reason and trying to assault her and trying to
[33:48.240 --> 33:55.280]  break the window at her business I get upset if I see two black men beating up
[33:55.280 --> 33:59.160]  a black woman or two white men beating up a white woman I get just as equally as
[33:59.160 --> 34:05.280]  angry because I'm not an idiot I operate off of what people stand for and what
[34:05.280 --> 34:10.560]  they create and what they do if I see a painting that I like I don't care if you're
[34:10.560 --> 34:15.160]  black or white if you painted it if I see a sculpture I don't care what color
[34:15.160 --> 34:19.480]  you are if I like it I like it I don't care what color you are if you're a jazz
[34:19.480 --> 34:27.240]  singer or a jazz musician I mean I love Jimi Hendrix songs not because he's black
[34:27.240 --> 34:33.460]  but because it touches me and I will not sit up here with a bunch of dumb
[34:33.460 --> 34:39.760]  down thugs who think attacking their local community churches and setting
[34:39.760 --> 34:45.200]  on fire since some message telling me I'm racist you're the people that are racist
[34:45.200 --> 34:50.080]  that are doing that and you give demonstrators a bad name but the larger
[34:50.080 --> 34:56.320]  issue is the controlled globalist operation that's robbing us all blind
[34:56.320 --> 35:00.720]  that wants to roll out a paramilitary force in America that they told us was
[35:00.720 --> 35:11.440]  for al-Qaeda 14 years ago but that I told you over and over and over again was
[35:11.440 --> 35:17.120]  for the American people across the board but they'll always pick some group oh
[35:17.120 --> 35:22.760]  it's black people so we've got to have a police state for them playing off
[35:22.760 --> 35:27.240]  underlying prejudice and racism but also stereotypes that are being played
[35:27.240 --> 35:35.560]  out being played like a fiddle but then the real target in all the homeland
[35:35.560 --> 35:40.360]  security training and all the real preparation is gun owners rural
[35:40.360 --> 35:45.560]  communities self-sufficient people just like the control system didn't want
[35:45.560 --> 35:49.280]  Native Americans to be self-sufficient and put on reservations blacks have been
[35:49.280 --> 35:54.480]  put on reservations modern plantations they want everybody under that model
[35:54.480 --> 35:59.920]  it's called agenda 21 and it affects everyone and it takes all the old
[35:59.920 --> 36:04.720]  systems of control and brings them up to the 21st century standards of
[36:04.720 --> 36:12.960]  sophistication so there's no debating I'm right there's no debating we predicted
[36:12.960 --> 36:20.040]  this in spades there's no debating that everyone's being played off against each
[36:20.040 --> 36:24.640]  other like chumps and there's no debating what the next phase will be remember
[36:24.640 --> 36:27.880]  our articles and special report videos that we ought to go pull the special
[36:27.880 --> 36:32.280]  reports I did on the nightly news it's right here in the article US Army
[36:32.280 --> 36:38.000]  training to fight black Americans doomsday Disneyland facility used as
[36:38.000 --> 36:43.040]  practice ground for civil unrest we ought to flashback this article top of
[36:43.040 --> 36:48.040]  info wars with the video I did on the nightly news a special report I aired it
[36:48.040 --> 36:54.960]  the next day on the radio to five million listeners a day saying this was
[36:54.960 --> 36:58.760]  coming and that after the elections it's on the video it's in the article go
[36:58.760 --> 37:05.520]  watch it I'll play it next hour about an eight minute report I told you exactly
[37:05.520 --> 37:15.200]  what would happen and it's not because I have a crystal ball it's because I am
[37:15.200 --> 37:23.280]  outside the box watching the globalist prepare for 22 years on air for 20 I've
[37:23.280 --> 37:27.440]  had the special forces jump out of the woods and set fires and try to blame
[37:27.440 --> 37:31.840]  them on me I've been attacked physically and told shut up I've gotten the phone
[37:31.840 --> 37:34.880]  calls where nothing shows up on caller ID and they tell you what you just did
[37:34.880 --> 37:40.240]  five minutes before I've lived it I know what's going on I know about the FEMA
[37:40.240 --> 37:44.120]  camps I know about where they are I've given you the names where you can look
[37:44.120 --> 37:47.560]  them up the emergency centers establishment act the civilian inmate
[37:47.560 --> 37:51.640]  labor camp program they're not called FEMA camps chemtrails aren't called
[37:51.640 --> 37:55.840]  chemtrails they're called geoengineering programs they play
[37:55.840 --> 38:01.040]  lawyer games with all of you and I want all of you to be free because my
[38:01.040 --> 38:07.320]  children are going to live on this planet with your children and if I
[38:07.320 --> 38:13.080]  screw somebody over it comes back on me I don't want 52% of black people to
[38:13.080 --> 38:19.040]  never be born to be butchered I don't want all the Hispanic girls in Latin
[38:19.040 --> 38:24.280]  America being injected with Gardasil to basically sterilize them even though
[38:24.280 --> 38:28.560]  blacks and Latin Americans are being prepared as the enemy for race war
[38:28.560 --> 38:34.000]  against gringos I still can't give up my humanity I see the brainwashing I see
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.600]  the mind control I see us all being turned into biological program programmable
[38:38.600 --> 38:44.480]  robots I see white's fearful going with the power structure and the police state
[38:44.480 --> 38:51.040]  out of necessity and fear because they've been wrongfully demonized
[38:52.880 --> 38:57.720]  less than 2% of Americans in the South owned slaves Smithsonian Institute look
[38:57.720 --> 39:02.920]  it up most Americans who are white immigrated here their grandparents or
[39:02.920 --> 39:09.240]  great-grandparents after slavery Ireland never had slavery Irish were slaves in
[39:09.240 --> 39:14.120]  this country and in Ireland no one even knows about the million Irish slaves in
[39:14.120 --> 39:19.600]  this country are we gonna have reparations for them see how stupid this
[39:19.600 --> 39:27.840]  is you know I'm Irish part Irish on two sides of my dad's family I'm proud of my
[39:27.840 --> 39:34.340]  Irish roots I don't have some inferiority complex because ancestors of
[39:34.340 --> 39:42.200]  mine came over here as sharecroppers indentured Irish slaves
[39:44.640 --> 39:49.560]  that just adds to the vigor of my blood
[39:52.280 --> 39:57.400]  also had family that was British nobility famous people I'm not gonna
[39:57.400 --> 40:01.960]  get into all that the point is is that I'm proud of my Native American ancestry
[40:01.960 --> 40:08.120]  I am a human first and foremost and what what I stand for is justice ladies and
[40:08.120 --> 40:13.160]  gentlemen and it makes me want to throw up to see the dumb down racist thugs out
[40:13.160 --> 40:21.600]  there basically black Klansman in my view I mean people talk about the
[40:21.600 --> 40:27.240]  caricatures and magazines and things of blacks making fun of them or in Nazi
[40:27.240 --> 40:31.080]  Germany of Jews do you have any idea about the cartoons making fun of Irish
[40:31.080 --> 40:36.400]  and the eugenicists in the 1870s and 80s teaching that Irish were mentally
[40:36.400 --> 40:42.440]  retarded and stupid but I mean you don't see the Irish running around today
[40:42.440 --> 40:47.400]  feeling sorry for themselves the system even tried to implant them with an
[40:47.400 --> 40:59.120]  inferiority complex it didn't work folks it didn't work
[41:01.680 --> 41:06.840]  and that's all this is is a mind game people going to the White House run by
[41:06.840 --> 41:09.960]  the Soros groups Soros connected groups you talked about yesterday on their
[41:09.960 --> 41:14.480]  signs to go demand Obama do something federalize cut off the states in
[41:14.480 --> 41:20.440]  tight cops supersede the grand jury and jury bring us a dictatorship open the
[41:20.440 --> 41:23.760]  borders give us Obama care take the guns
[41:23.760 --> 41:27.720]  executively that's what they're being taught that Obama could have delivered
[41:27.720 --> 41:30.800]  you all this free stuff but he's on a dictator yet and now they've got the
[41:30.800 --> 41:35.000]  Democratic Party operatives all over the country trying to stir up riots all
[41:35.000 --> 41:41.520]  over the nation and when they're done if they're successful they'll ban all
[41:41.520 --> 41:46.920]  assembly and all free speech so they could bring in the real tyranny they
[41:46.920 --> 41:51.480]  will associate free speech and assembly with people shooting at firefighters and
[41:51.480 --> 41:56.040]  police did you hear me tearing to the police when they shot our reporters and
[41:56.040 --> 42:00.840]  citizens with rubber bullets for no reason yes because it was wrong see I
[42:00.840 --> 42:05.240]  don't take sides I go with what's obviously common sense but let me tell
[42:05.240 --> 42:13.960]  you shooting people rubber bullets is a far cry from shooting police and FBI and
[42:13.960 --> 42:24.800]  firefighters shooting up their vehicles so that you can create terror and fear
[42:24.800 --> 42:31.360]  now shifting gears out of that US Army training to fight black Americans July
[42:31.360 --> 42:35.920]  five and a half months ago four and a half months ago doomsday Disneyland
[42:35.920 --> 42:41.800]  facility used as practice ground for civil unrest local police training with
[42:41.800 --> 42:48.680]  US National Guard groups regular Army you name it in fact Watson and I don't
[42:48.680 --> 42:52.120]  blame him he's in England said US National Guard they they do train but
[42:52.120 --> 42:56.800]  the video is big army regular army you can see the patches you can see the
[42:56.800 --> 43:01.320]  insignia on the trucks Joe Biggs confirmed it it's big army we should
[43:01.320 --> 43:05.760]  probably add that to this article and he goes over the entire plan and the
[43:05.760 --> 43:11.320]  admissions for domestic resistance close quote US Army War Colleges
[43:11.320 --> 43:18.360]  preparation for insurrection now what it retired general calls for US Army on
[43:18.360 --> 43:21.960]  streets restore civil order see what I'm saying to the folks that are listening
[43:21.960 --> 43:27.040]  first of some of them they're mad at us you're being discredited by people
[43:27.040 --> 43:31.280]  throwing bricks and shooting guns I'm being discredited in my first amendment
[43:31.280 --> 43:37.480]  I'm not gonna be sigh opt I'm not gonna not see the plan and fall for it I'm not
[43:37.480 --> 43:44.120]  gonna be chomped or gamed or schmucked or conned I'm not a mark I'm not here to
[43:44.120 --> 43:48.120]  fail I'm not here to be a joke I'm not here to be mindless I'm not here to be
[43:48.120 --> 43:53.360]  lazy I'm not here to be stupid I'm here to try to warn people about the program
[43:53.360 --> 43:59.360]  CNN info wars calm as the video retired general calls for US Army on the
[43:59.360 --> 44:02.760]  streets restore civil order this is the same general that ran gun confiscations
[44:02.760 --> 44:09.000]  in the high and dry areas Russell L honor a commander of joint task force
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.360]  Katrina across the Gulf Coast that engaged in total criminal action he now
[44:13.360 --> 44:19.280]  says put troops regular troops on the ground that's why they didn't pounce on
[44:19.280 --> 44:23.520]  the few people shooting and burning you could have cops on every street corner
[44:23.520 --> 44:28.120]  somebody pulls a gun out starts to aim at you shoot them kill a couple of the
[44:28.120 --> 44:31.200]  terrorist people trying to terrorize shooting at firefighters that's
[44:31.200 --> 44:36.400]  terrorism that's that's it and they'll all disappear then peaceful demonstrators
[44:36.400 --> 44:43.440]  will be able to have their first amendment didn't do that you shoot two or three
[44:43.440 --> 44:48.040]  people setting fires oh well the police are intimidated by the response no
[44:48.040 --> 44:51.840]  they're not I'll say something else on average even police departments are
[44:51.840 --> 44:55.320]  corrupt they don't want to shoot somebody in the middle of the street just for
[44:55.320 --> 45:00.960]  fun knowing the paperwork the backlash the lawsuits you can hardly get cops to
[45:00.960 --> 45:05.560]  do their job nowadays because they're so worried about lawsuits you know you think
[45:05.560 --> 45:09.240]  all day they just want to go around dealing with domestic disturbances and
[45:09.240 --> 45:14.560]  pit bulls and crack houses and just white trash meth labs and all the rest of it
[45:14.560 --> 45:18.120]  I mean you really think the cops are running or running around wanting to
[45:18.120 --> 45:28.080]  shoot black people on average no they're not no they're not they're wanting to go
[45:28.080 --> 45:32.960]  to the topless bar and try to pick a girl up I'll guarantee you I mean it is
[45:32.960 --> 45:36.960]  just so frustrating are they getting money on the side or some of them
[45:36.960 --> 45:40.120]  dealing drugs you bet are they pulling people over writing tickets all day and
[45:40.120 --> 45:44.160]  doing some illegal asset for which a seizure you bet we'll talk about that
[45:44.160 --> 45:48.320]  all day but I'm not just going to be maneuvered into a civil war with police
[45:48.320 --> 45:54.240]  in general because the UN and the globalists want that to bring in their
[45:54.240 --> 46:00.040]  Pentagon ran corporation national stabilization force I have hundreds of
[46:00.040 --> 46:04.760]  declassified public Army War College Navy War College Marine Corps War Planning
[46:04.760 --> 46:10.720]  School it's all linked bunch of them are linked to this article document I'm
[46:10.720 --> 46:13.640]  preparing to use lethal force against unarmed civilians during full-scale
[46:13.640 --> 46:18.040]  riots in the US go read the training manual we actually do real research we
[46:18.040 --> 46:22.360]  actually know what we're talking about and now we have this retired general on
[46:22.360 --> 46:26.520]  saying and saying this is the answer they're gonna let this get out of hand
[46:26.520 --> 46:32.160]  the Democratic Party operatives are stirring it up on every front do you
[46:32.160 --> 46:35.480]  think the globalist care of a bunch of cops and citizens get killed they love
[46:35.480 --> 46:40.560]  it what have I fought for at least a decade since I figured this out they
[46:40.560 --> 46:44.400]  want to stage a civil war in this country every preparation is for it let's
[46:44.400 --> 46:53.280]  not be idiots let's not do it let's not be part of it let's not be morons I mean
[46:53.280 --> 46:56.960]  my gosh the last two weeks I've been doing specials on CA drug dealing in the
[46:56.960 --> 47:01.400]  black areas to destabilize them fighting to help these communities because it's
[47:01.400 --> 47:05.680]  a cancer point they're trying to spread it's not just that I care it also is
[47:05.680 --> 47:12.480]  self-serving to want people uplifted but because I don't mindlessly support a
[47:12.480 --> 47:17.160]  bunch of thugs we're stupid is the jacarita ready yet if we bleeped all
[47:17.160 --> 47:20.600]  the cussing yet we're pulling it in right now we'll have it the next segment
[47:20.600 --> 47:25.200]  it's unedited on info wars.com but I can't hear all these cuss words man I
[47:25.200 --> 47:27.440]  tell you this why I can't go these events somebody comes up search you know
[47:27.440 --> 47:31.720]  threatening me and you better watch it and I'll show you and all this jacarita
[47:31.720 --> 47:37.320]  a great job being restrained and so did Joe Biggs besides why would you threaten
[47:37.320 --> 47:42.440]  jacarita and bow up to him when I'm the one that said it's terrorist to shoot at
[47:42.440 --> 47:48.160]  firefighters to create fear that's the definition of terrorism is to threaten
[47:48.160 --> 47:54.240]  violence or carry out violence for a political or financial aim. Don't come
[47:54.240 --> 47:59.280]  play basketball these basketball courts are I'll kill you that's terrorism that's
[47:59.280 --> 48:07.360]  fear that's how the mafia operates. Let's go ahead now and go to this clip of
[48:07.360 --> 48:11.160]  the general that there's the actual definition the use of violence and
[48:11.160 --> 48:17.760]  intimidation in the pursuit of political aims boom. Now let's go ahead and go to
[48:17.760 --> 48:21.800]  the general promoting with the CIA operative by the way that's declassified
[48:21.800 --> 48:27.640]  he is CIA and he's also a robber baron heir Anderson Cooper here it is but I'm
[48:27.640 --> 48:33.480]  tell you this Anderson if St. Louis can't control this you know what the next
[48:33.480 --> 48:39.320]  step is and it's called the party insurrection act the same thing they
[48:39.320 --> 48:43.760]  did out in Los Angeles now we're nowhere near that now but people might want to
[48:43.760 --> 48:48.520]  look at that because that is a statute that's designed if local authorities
[48:48.520 --> 48:55.800]  cannot control and provide civil law inside their cities over. You know it's
[48:55.800 --> 49:02.720]  interesting general to when we heard earlier today from the mayor of Ferguson
[49:02.720 --> 49:06.200]  who himself came under a lot of criticism of course during the summer
[49:06.200 --> 49:10.840]  no racial divide the city. So you got the globalist fanning the flames pushing
[49:10.840 --> 49:15.640]  this oh my gosh over and over again trying to get it going trying to get the
[49:15.640 --> 49:21.400]  party started. I mean can't everybody just see we're being chumped here I told
[49:21.400 --> 49:26.320]  you it was all coming I gave you all the documents I told you they're shipping
[49:26.320 --> 49:30.040]  drugs in the community and gave you the proof that the Iran contra whistleblowers
[49:30.040 --> 49:36.520]  the king pins all of it proven here and the same general that confiscated the
[49:36.520 --> 49:40.920]  guns from white people's homes they didn't go in the black area they went
[49:40.920 --> 49:46.880]  and looted rich people's houses the government did. The police went around
[49:46.880 --> 49:52.640]  robbing Walmart's remember and we criticized it when the police are bad
[49:52.640 --> 49:56.920]  we do we we just look at the facts and try to put the truth out my job is
[49:56.920 --> 50:05.040]  actually pretty easy. It's so upset sometimes absolutely outrageous
[50:05.040 --> 50:10.080]  absolutely outrageous when we come back we've got the clip of a thug confronting
[50:10.080 --> 50:16.760]  Jakari Jackson and bringing up our broadcast here Rand Paul politicians
[50:16.760 --> 50:20.280]  are to blame for Ferguson war on drugs creates culture of violence Paul says
[50:20.280 --> 50:28.240]  yes and then CIA funding thug life gangster hip-hop which turns people
[50:28.240 --> 50:34.520]  into absolute criminal scum. Burn this bleeper down Brown Family Church

[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:41.640]  reporters on the ground David Knight of course Leanne McAdoo the folks behind the
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:46.040]  scenes like Marcos Morales and Darren McBrain just did a fabulous job

[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:55.680]  to expand if you just joined us unfortunately what we predicted is
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.920]  coming true globalist criminals inside our government the same ones that are
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:04.880]  funding al-Qaeda and ISIS are trying to destabilize the US and create racial
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:09.840]  division and Balkanization as a pretext for federalized crackdowns but the feds
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:14.800]  themselves have been seized by the globalist and they are running a system
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:21.800]  right now they're establishing a system right now of legitimizing the rollout
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.720]  of this program do you agree with me do you disagree I want to leave the phones
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:33.240]  up for the first round just the first five ten calls or so not for first time
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:38.840]  callers not for free for all but for Ferguson residents or others that
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:46.080]  disagree with my coverage in our angle our analysis I don't see how if you're
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.480]  being honest you could disagree with me and just play the trump card that's
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:58.040]  been so overplayed it's worthless of calling me a racist for pointing out
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:04.440]  the Democratic Party and the news CNN MSNBC are promoting violent
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:07.960]  demonstrations to demonize the First Amendment create Balkanization and a
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:12.400]  pretext for crackdown with protests popping up all over the country with
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:18.240]  people smashing out windows to then associate protesting with that we're
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.920]  gonna play the jacari Jackson confrontation that we've bleeped out
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:29.160]  mask thug mask thugs confront threatened reporter and Ferguson I'll show you a
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:41.840]  terrorist rioter told reporter so that's a kid Daniels report that's up on
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:55.960]  info wars.com that's all coming up at the start of the next segment then we're
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:03.040]  going to get into other news that we've not been covering while we've been
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.200]  distracted by this whole Ferguson situation that could blow up to engulf
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:11.760]  the entire country I don't normally cover let's be honest 95% of the
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:16.920]  news articles about me every day there's a whole bunch of big blogs or online
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:22.080]  newspapers daily beef raw story young curks the list goes on and on that
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:27.840]  attack us media matters White House run MSNBC every few weeks I was told I was
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:33.680]  attacked on MSNBC last night by somebody I saw at a gas station but we
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:37.520]  don't just cover stuff because it's about us we cover it if it illustrates
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:42.000]  something a Don Salazar walked up to me before the show today and he said have
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  you seen this and reportedly this is in the magazine as well which is in
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.480]  pretty much every Texas home it is a big magazine so the top 20 in the country
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:55.560]  and I've been featured in it in a serious profile they did that was pretty
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:02.160]  fair overall this is bizarre and this is getting really weird the article
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:08.280]  halfway looks at it and is halfway serious saying I may be Bill Hicks
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:14.200]  basically I mean this is really getting weird now man they've people gone to
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:19.000]  Rockwall Texas and gotten my annuals they've gone and somehow got my birth
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.400]  certificate and then they think that's fake and all because Kevin Booth lived
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:28.200]  here in Austin it was in LA now and I knew him at Access Television he'd
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:33.000]  produced some of Bill Hicks's records and Ninja Bachelor party and so therefore
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.640]  I look a little bit like Bill Hicks so I'm him I mean this is just Twilight Zone
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:44.120]  they had a major magazine I mean can you imagine because I've talked to some of
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.920]  the family years ago this has been going on for about five years they're very
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:52.040]  upset about this and Bill Hicks is in the ground folks Kevin was there when he
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:05:00.640]  died pancreatic cancer it's not funny it's sick very sick the government's
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:04.480]  Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo at the same time
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:08.640]  they're restricting civilians rights to own and purchase firearms can you put

[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:22.600]  ladies and gentlemen we've been telling you the last few months the reason we've
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:29.960]  been focused quite a bit of our time on Ferguson is because if you watch CNN
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:34.960]  MSNBC White House Run Media Matters the Justice Department from Trayvon
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:41.440]  Martin right up to now they are in there trying to stir things up then they
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:45.760]  have Obama come out and call for calm on the top but this is the Democratic
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:49.800]  Party's policy and if you look at the White House demonstrations and the LA
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.560]  demonstrations and the New York demonstrations and all the rest of
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:57.760]  hundreds people taking over highways you name it knocking windows out hundreds
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:04.000]  of arrests per city 180 in LA alone you look at the signs it's communist groups
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.920]  socialist groups that are issuing the signs priming it running it democratic
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:14.800]  party groups socialist connected sorrows groups and there's been reports out in
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:20.520]  the media on this showing it getting this going because Obama is imploding in
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.920]  their whole socialist agenda is falling on its face and there's moves towards
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:28.440]  impeachment and hearings and lawsuits and Obama here to get overturned and the
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:33.760]  globalists want to wreck this country clowered and piven agenda 21 it's
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:37.360]  happening so they desperately want to divide and conquer that's what the
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:41.680]  Romans did the British did that's what empires do when they're outnumbered a
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:46.960]  thousand to one is they get the natives fighting with each other now do I
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:50.000]  lionize local police departments are there some issues with the Ferguson
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  Department absolutely but let's pull back it doesn't matter who's right or
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.800]  wrong here the media is shy hopping this and then if you call people shooting
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:05.320]  up police vehicles and fire department vehicles shooting to FBI agents shooting
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:09.360]  to police officers killing somebody else in their car threatening our
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:13.480]  reporters throwing rocks at reporters black reporters burning down black
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:19.040]  churches and then we say it's horrible and we say it's terrorism to shoot at
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.760]  fire trucks and firefighters and our reporters heard bullets going by their
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:29.760]  head Joe Biggs heard about a hundred shots in just a one minute period and
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:34.400]  he's been in heavy combat Joe never really talks about it but you can read
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:39.120]  where he was embedded rolling stone and with Esquire in the big battles they
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:44.280]  were in and he knows what it sounds like that was going on and you've got the
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:50.760]  police standing down up front to exacerbate the rioting they use the LA
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:54.640]  riots in 92 to militarize police they're gonna do it again because there's a
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:57.840]  major public backlash against federalization the armored vehicles
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:03.240]  the rest of it and I didn't just come out and say this today US Army training
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:08.080]  to fight black Americans doomsday Disneyland facility used as practice
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:14.660]  ground for civil unrest you know I just thought about it I want to get Paul
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:19.760]  Watson on maybe at the start of the next hour or something to give us his
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.040]  take on all this because I know he's right in the middle of researching and
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.520]  reporting it I want to get his angle our reporters that I've pulled out because
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:29.000]  now it's spread nationwide I think 10 days is enough for them in Ferguson
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.560]  jacari and Joe are about to land in about 30 minutes we're trying to get him
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:38.060]  in here in studio give us a take on what happened last night by the way this
[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:43.040]  radio crew TV crew also worked until 10 o'clock 11 o'clock last night over
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:46.320]  there so just the whole crew working around the clock with our skeleton
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:54.360]  operation to bring you serious major news coverage of what's happening just
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.640]  pointing out that that's how far the alternative media has come now becoming
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:05.420]  the media so they've been preparing this preparing for the
[01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:09.400]  Psyop knowing they can manipulate the black community into this and now it's
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:15.520]  happening that's what's going on and now you have retired general calls for US
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.040]  Army on the streets restore civil order the same general that ran the gun
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:23.300]  confiscation there in Katrina that's what this whole agenda is about get a
[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:27.720]  civil war going so you can bring in UN forces and have gun confiscation that's
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:32.480]  the actual plan out of North Common the UN with the UN treaty going into effect
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:38.920]  December 24th I want to hear I'm gonna open the phones up right now for the
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:43.760]  first round of people that disagree with me and by the way if you don't really
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:48.800]  disagree don't call if you really disagree if you're this thug in my view
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:52.600]  in my opinion threatening jacari with a mask on in the middle of all this
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:56.000]  rioting clearly a provocateur whether they work for the government or not
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:03.120]  stirring things up I'd like to hear from you 800-259-9231 because you're
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:10.560]  clearly listening you're clearly watching 800-259-9231 but at the bottom of
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:15.760]  all this socialist and communist ideology is about a violent overthrow of
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:21.280]  the disenfranchised underclass but if you got a big rich middle class people
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:25.000]  won't want to be part of that system and stand in line to get their sausages and
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.040]  their potatoes like in the Soviet Union they won't join with socialists so you
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:32.760]  got to bankrupt the country first and that's what's shutting our power plants
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:36.800]  and shutting our jobs off and raising our taxes and all the regulations are
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:41.480]  about while Obama and Al Gore the rest of them own stock in the Chinese
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:49.120]  companies who got real Chinese slaves working in them it's all a big scam to
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:58.600]  bring the country down to conquer it so here's the toll-free number 800-259-9231
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:12.840]  800-259-9231 800-259-9231 you can use that Obama phone to call right in here
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:21.440]  and tell me how I'm wrong tell me how I'm a racist tell me how Brown was
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:27.840]  sacrificed the articles on infowars.com professor says Mike Brown
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:34.160]  sacrificed to a racist God robbery suspect sacrificed God of American
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:38.880]  whiteness oh is that why the US government brings in as many non-Europeans as
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:42.840]  they can there's a there's a white power thing running things according to the
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:47.520]  associate professor of religious studies the University of Pennsylvania Athena
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:52.520]  Butler robbery suspect Mike Brown was sacrificed to the God of white
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:59.040]  supremacy right Butler imbues her diatribe against a racist white America
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.520]  with religious overtones yeah because the cop wanted to have to basically lose
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:06.480]  his job now he and he wanted to be hunted and hated and and go through all
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.080]  this yeah I'm sure that's why he did it no it's because he got beat up and was
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:16.160]  being charged again and was scared no one should be surprised that Darren
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:21.880]  Wilson was not indicted by the grand jury prosecutor Robert McCulloch this I
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:29.960]  say it played a role of Pontius Pilot OC Brown was Christ figure folks strong
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:34.920]  arming people for cigarettes or cigars washing his hands and Darren Wilson's
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:41.160]  hands of impunity while the sacrifice Michael Brown was deemed worthy of death
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:46.360]  because in Wilson's words he looked like a demon well it looks like a demon in
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:50.520]  some of his gangster photos he got his stepdad saying burn everything down I
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:58.240]  mean man Wilson even uses the sacred instrument to complete his sacrifice to
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:05.280]  the God of American whiteness the gun really mousy tongues of political power
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:09.800]  goes out the barrel of a gun I'm trying to get guns into people's hands so they
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:14.240]  can protect themselves regardless of their color and then it just goes on
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:19.520]  from there let's go to this piece that this clip raw footage actually of
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:23.520]  Jacarie Jackson last night during live coverage with someone approaching up

[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:31.960]  that we said all protesters are terrorists no we said people shooting at
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:37.360]  firefighters that's an act of terrorism by any stretch the imagination and I

[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:55.040]  then back at up 20 30 seconds this this guy
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.720]  demonstrator out there with the other rioters I don't know if he's involved in
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:02.680]  anything probably not but he's certainly angry and he's probably been a
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:07.520]  listener but he's inherently in my opinion in view very racist he sees
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:12.200]  things all according to race what I said is people I was very clear you can
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:17.000]  find the tape the video from yesterday I probably said it 15 times shooting at
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:23.360]  fire department people with the bullets slamming into the fire trucks with
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:28.560]  bullet holes in them and the media is so behind the looters that they're not even
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:32.600]  showing the bullet holes we have photos of video we've shown it burning down
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:37.880]  Brown's church attacking Mexican food restaurants attacking a white lady at
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:43.840]  Papa John's and makes $12 an hour man if somebody kills and rapes your sister
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:48.520]  and you don't get justice they wrote a book about it it's fiction but there is
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:54.120]  a time to kill let me tell you somebody killed somebody in my family and I know
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.720]  they did it and I saw him do it and they get away with it there'll be some
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:02.200]  justice don't you worry oh somebody shot a black guy I think it was wrong let me
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:06.720]  go burn down the black church let me go over here let me go over here and beat
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:12.320]  up a white lady at Papa John's shoes who's oppressing you well guess what
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:17.800]  there won't be any pizza place in your area now some guy gets off work is black
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:23.040]  or white whatever wants a pizza you're not getting it all that stuff can just
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:31.360]  shut down think about the logic we're mad so you said we're terrorists uh no
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:36.520]  uh in jacari defend me but he you know in fairness he wasn't there listening so
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:39.600]  you know he says well I'll explain if you're burning things as terrorism well
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:44.400]  that's arson and that is a form of terrorism but you just get charged under
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:48.120]  arson when you go out and try to shoot and kill people who are trying to put
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:53.480]  fires out to create fear that's terrorism and I didn't say this guy or
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:57.200]  anybody else did that I said whoever did it did it and those people should have
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:01.480]  been shot if you let me just explain something to you I'm driving down the
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:06.840]  road and I see somebody randomly shooting I'm gonna pull over get my rifle get
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:10.520]  behind the truck and I'm gonna shoot you not because I want to kill anybody but
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:13.680]  my instinct is ladies and gentlemen I mean I'm not bragging I don't know
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:17.040]  what's wrong with people I told the story my wife was there my son was like
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:25.840]  a year old I was at the Madeleine little restaurant this woman's choking I mean I
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:29.960]  go to the bathroom we're about to leave I come out and everybody's around this
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:34.800]  table like 15 people around this table and this lady is choking turning blue
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:39.320]  and they're and they're like parrots going call 911 call 911 call 911 call
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:43.320]  911 I started listen anybody know how to do the Heimlich I took those classes and
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:47.840]  stuff when I was on swim team I didn't want to do it because there's lawsuits
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:51.440]  you can break a rib but I said somebody in there a doctor a nurse do the Heimlich
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:57.960]  they all just keep going 911 911 911 see the government's gonna handle it it's
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:01.760]  the same entitlement mentality so she starts falling on the table turning
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:06.280]  blue she's clearly gonna pass out then she's so big probably was 380 pounds I
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:11.360]  might be able to get her up so I say that's it had to push people aside grab
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:15.280]  it huge piece of bread comes out everybody's oh you're a hero you're a
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:18.320]  hero but they're all kind of looking at me weird next comes a lawsuit I was out
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:21.920]  of there because another thing in America there's a bunch of fat white
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:28.200]  people another thing in America is you're it's bad to help somebody too so
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:31.000]  don't ever forget about that and I wasn't going off into a story I'll
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:37.480]  just I'll guarantee you I will guarantee you and by the way there's video of
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:40.640]  this somewhere I'm not just saying this I went out to a La Raza rally one time
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:44.680]  downtown with a bullhorn follow them in their face saying they were racist and
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:47.760]  had like 10 guys come say they were gonna kick my ass I said let's go and they
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:51.440]  backed off I'm not saying I'm tough either but I'm not backing down that's
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:57.480]  why I don't go to these events because I'd have probably gotten a fight I mean I
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:05.960]  am sick and tired of ignorant morons makes me want to throw up and I know
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:12.920]  racist when I see him I protested the Klan La Raza met you and I grew up in
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:16.280]  Dallas and I had a lot of black friends but I learned real quick there's nice
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:20.760]  black people and there's racist black people and racist black people are some
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:24.880]  of the most entitled racist people you will ever run into and they just think
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:28.760]  that it's their right to hate you because your skin color and you know
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:32.240]  what I'm not a bigot though and I'm not small-minded so I'm not gonna ride off
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:35.400]  all the great black people out there because there's a bunch of dumb racist
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:41.360]  out there but I'm telling you I'm sick of it this thing is a Psyop and these
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:46.720]  people love the attention and they can do this with any group you know with a
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:52.400]  kid in a well or a missing baby or it's this narcissistic culture where you just
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:59.440]  show all the brown thing or oh you know the mystery of who is the guest model
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:06.640]  you know and her death and all that whatever the diversion is and everybody
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:11.200]  just gets into there on TV the news is paying attention to them only as a
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:15.920]  Psyop to tell other people go out and riot go out and loot go out and chant
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:20.040]  racist slogans to demonize demonstrating so the globalist can take over the
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:27.960]  country that's what's going on what is it you don't understand about that James
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:32.280]  the Missouri disagrees on our coverage Jason disagrees on some points David
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:36.600]  Oregon disagrees Steven New Jersey disagrees things riots are necessary
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:43.000]  I'm gonna tell you something and I'm not calling for this but if people attack
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.400]  pharmaceutical companies like Bayer that was caught shipping out hundreds of
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:50.560]  thousands well at one time millions over the years of factor rate that they
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:56.840]  knew had HIV and hepatitis in it to kill little hemophiliac kids of every
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:01.000]  color into the rainbow and then they didn't get indicted in the U.S. they
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.480]  only did in France and Australia got found guilty if somebody's kid got
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:10.680]  killed by that and they went in and did something I would say well Bayer you
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:13.920]  know I don't want to handle things this way but this is this is an eye for an
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:22.960]  eye you're not going after the who you say did it plus it looks like Brown was
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:27.160]  a thug you haven't even the media picked this out of all the cases they could
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:30.880]  have picked or cops shoot black men in the back all the time you they didn't
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:36.400]  pick that the media picked this because it's a loser it'll make you look bad
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:43.920]  it's a setup to demonize black people but oh I'm racist what an ignoramus that
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:48.080]  gal never go protests that 50% of blacks get aboard it I'll never protest that
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:51.920]  fluoride I said double it's true three to six times worth for black people and
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:57.080]  all the major studies you can look it up just on you know what I it's so
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:02.520]  painful that that that you're just so racist I can't help you and you'll go
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:05.720]  down with the ship I get it that's why America's probably done because it's not
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:08.240]  just black folks you know in the inner city that have been dumped down it's
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:12.920]  everybody I mean black white you name I run the folks that are so stupid or so
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:17.320]  set on what they believe that you can't even reach them and it makes me want to
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:20.440]  throw up let's go back to the rest of the confrontation and then we're gonna go
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:22.440]  to break and come back with the folks disagree with me here it is
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:26.800]  do you want me to be peaceful if I kill and rape your sister do you want me to
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:33.720]  be peaceful am I responding to what I did to your sister if you want to
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:39.160]  respond to the police if I know I'm asking you if I rape and kill your
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:45.000]  sister if I rape and kill your sister will jacari then go and attack the
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.160]  Papa John's I mean that'd be like if somebody raped my sister and then I went
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:53.520]  down the road randomly and just found somebody else to blame I mean it's

[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:19.880]  information war. I'm your host Alex Jones at Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs at a great job from the front lines. You know why I hired Joe Biggs and
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:23.760]  in Jakari Jackson because both of them have courage both of them that stood up
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:27.600]  for the First Amendment and both of them I knew would make great team members in
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:32.240]  info wars and we look down the road as we get more funding hopefully to hire five
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:38.440]  or six more reporters more camera people more video editors more journalists more
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:44.040]  researchers that's what we're trying to build here and we are simply promoting
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:48.480]  the basic ideas of freedom I'm going to calls that disagree with me after we
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:53.120]  talked to James Dave Jason Steve Mack and others will keep taking calls we've
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:57.040]  got open phones we may end up having Jakari and Joe in studio towards the end
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:01.360]  if they're playing gets back on time they get in studio if they can get over
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:05.920]  here to the offices all of that is coming up I want to go to your calls but
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:10.800]  first off let's finish the video where Joe says easy ninja to the guy with a
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:16.560]  mask on and the other guy really gets in his face and says go go go and it said
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:21.240]  earlier you know I'll show you terrorist and it's just total thug behavior
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:28.640]  total intimidation garbage and he didn't want to get in the fight with Joe and
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:31.920]  Jakari I mean you know Joe's a little bit bigger than him
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:37.720]  jacarys a lot bigger I mean jacarys in really good shape and I just love
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:40.880]  jacarys that I'm afraid of you those guys kind of start backing off I
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:43.960]  couldn't see the video because jacarys was shooting it but I think jacarys
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:47.280]  probably was getting ready to knock that guy outside the head if he did
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:53.600]  something but just really good restraint really good restraint by the guys and I
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:57.360]  told them don't go into the crowds they disregarded what I told them but I mean
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:01.520]  how do you get mad at them the good news is all's well that ends well they got
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:05.320]  out of there now we're pulling them out as of last night I said just get back in
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:08.840]  the morning because if they could get a flight which they have because now the
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:12.000]  feds have had what they wanted the globalist that run the feds they're
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.880]  spreading the protests all over the country they're destabilizing things
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:22.080]  they're getting what they wanted more racial division more police state and a
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:26.320]  diversion for Obama with all of his executive orders and that agenda and if
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:56.160]  you oppose Obama you're racist let's go ahead and finish up the clip
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:00.960]  that's what you got to understand
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:15.560]  they're anger man that's right you have to look at it that's how you respond to
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:25.440]  aggression people are tired I didn't try to investigate and label black people
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:39.720]  to come to the hood and I'll let me okay I'll find them just like I found you
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:50.080]  I tell you to wherever you are I'm not vouchers for people breaking in the
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:52.440]  building that's what I try to tell the guy I said you won't come out here
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:55.160]  especially angry you won't come out in peaceful protest that's cool but what's
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:57.840]  breaking in that boost mobile store gonna do to help anything he said I didn't
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:00.280]  break in the boost mobile store I said but that you talking about let's be out
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:03.080]  here justifying people breaking into the boost mobile store I didn't say you did
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:05.880]  it I didn't say you burned down whatever building between but people aren't
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:08.440]  supposed to be out here burning down buildings that's not gonna bring back
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:11.560]  Mike Brown it's not gonna do anything to Darren Wilson all it's doing to turn
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:15.480]  down this community that's all I said they do whoever he is it for rockin
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:18.200]  tour try to tear me down the dollar it's about to run from I ain't run from I
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.880]  said you said turn your boy down here and I'll tell them talk to rip off your
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:25.840]  pants I'll tell them to come find you I'll go find him so that's what happened
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:37.280]  anyways do we have to be played like a fiddle by the globalist I mean just I'll
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:41.520]  tell you black people started rioting and going after playing Parenthoods if
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:44.800]  they read where Margaret Sanger said we'll kill these weeds well we'll hire
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:50.440]  the Democratic Party to run them you know I would say well they they know who
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:55.520]  the enemy is and I'm not saying they should do that but you've got 52% of
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:59.200]  black people killed by the loving liberals that are really white
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:06.360]  supremacists and instead if I don't think shooting at that's what I said not
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:10.520]  even the burning but that that borders on it arson is obviously a form of
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:18.400]  terrorism but when you shoot at firefighters I mean come on and I didn't
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:22.440]  say he said all of you black people he's saying you're terrorists no I said
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:26.440]  there are terrorists in there to de-legitimize legitimate demonstrations
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:29.600]  and when the police were shooting at the demonstrators for no reason months
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:34.240]  ago we were against it it's common sense and people like that aren't being honest
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:39.360]  he was lying to the crowd misrepresenting never letting jacarie talk
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:47.280]  very suspicious is all I can say he had talking points and it's just very sad
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:53.200]  let's go ahead now and go to the phone calls see the full video unedited the
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:39:00.280]  only editing in there is cutting out the cuss words and there's no way to do it
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:03.120]  in a crowd like that you cut the clear ones out but obviously back in the
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:07.320]  background there's a cacophony of stuff coming out but let's go to Jason and
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:12.080]  Ferguson and Steve Mac Dave James and others okay you disagree on some points
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:18.040]  go ahead Jason yes first and foremost I want to say that I have mad respect for
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:23.840]  jacarie always looked up to him glad you got him on your crew but I mean I've
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:27.800]  lived in Ferguson for a while I mean I've recently just moved out before
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:33.720]  everything started happening but man I've been harassed by Ferguson I mean
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:40.160]  they've told my car they've broken my windows I went to protest at the courthouse
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:45.880]  and I've got I've gotten followed by intimidate intimidated by police I mean
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:51.320]  the reality here Alex the reason why people are so now first and foremost I
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:57.800]  do not condone any type of violence no no no no and I'm in an interrelationship
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:03.480]  marriage right now so it's pretty hard right now living here dealing with this
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:08.400]  because I mean we have to look at both sides but the reality is the reason why
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:16.640]  you see this is there is predatory police they have no respect not all of
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:20.520]  them because I've been helped by Ferguson police as well with my with my
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:25.320]  girlfriend was pregnant at the time and I was rushing to the hospital one guy
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:29.640]  pulled me over but he escorted me to the hospital but just for every good
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:35.240]  there's like ten times more bad things sure you're sure but you're missing what
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:40.560]  I'm saying obviously if the town's 70% black and there's what three police
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:43.920]  officers out of 50 something that are black I mean it should be at least half
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:46.640]  the folks should be black problem is they have trouble recruiting and the
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:50.600]  police departments admit that is their problems are the police being trained to
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:54.800]  be paramilitary did they shoot Joe Biggs with rubber bullets for no reason
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:41:00.680]  absolutely and so what we're getting at here is there's obviously something
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:05.800]  wrong in Ferguson but then you can't give cover I'm not saying you're doing
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:10.640]  this but those demonstrating to people shooting at the fire department because
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:15.920]  there might be some profiling and harassment going on and yes do they
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:19.640]  take because there's thug life stuff going on by a minority of people in the
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:23.160]  black community do they then project that on to all black people absolutely
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:30.240]  but I mean I I watch behavior and if a black guy or a white guy is dressed
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:34.320]  nice they get left alone by police the few times I've been raggedy when I was
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:37.480]  younger and doing something I've had the police pull over and harass me and it
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:42.080]  makes you really mad so I think even more than just driving while black I
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:46.720]  think driving while poor I think you know driving I mean let me tell you kids
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:51.280]  like to dress hip-hop the police are trained that means gang related so that's
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:56.960]  why MTV has this hip-hop to prison pipeline is to get everybody in the
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:01.960]  uniform that the police like attack dogs have been trained to attack so what I'm
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:10.280]  saying is rise above it see the larger Psyop now the Psyop is winning training
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:13.760]  us all to fight with each other this is a big victory for the globalist the
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:17.680]  Democratic Party and others that are helping stir up demonstrations nationwide
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:21.200]  that are not going to make these communities better they are going to
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:25.720]  create more division in my humble opinion go ahead yes I want to say this
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:31.920]  foremost you know like I said I am not a racist I love all my people period that's
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:37.240]  but I'm telling you because of the issues of poor not even you're absolutely
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:43.280]  right not a racing but driving while poor period being poor period you get
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:46.680]  these tickets you can't afford to pay for you gotta get admission to your car
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:51.520]  you can't afford to pay you're constantly getting broke from the system
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:57.920]  when you are broke like this I'm warning oh thank God I got on the air but I'm
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:03.840]  going to warn all you law-abiding citizens you think you think that you're
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:09.520]  safe you're not these people like me I haven't did anything wrong we're
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:14.120]  frustrated we're tired there is no outlet there is no where to turn and when
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:18.000]  you don't have any place to turn where do you turn you turn to the streets you
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.880]  turn to your people you turn to the no I hear you but listen burning down who do
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:26.720]  you think burned down Mike Brown's church why attack a Mexican food restaurant
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:34.800]  I mean what does what does attacking a lady at the pizza place do nothing but
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:40.600]  hurt the cause absolutely I'm not making excuses for these people period no I
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:44.600]  know I know so so and I'm saying the cops should have helped the firefighters
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:48.880]  and they should have stopped people shooting first and foremost and then
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:53.880]  protected the demonstrators I mean listen both sides are being manipulated
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:57.880]  it's a total Psyop and you know I'm sorry to hear what happened to you in
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:00.920]  Ferguson we should get your name a number maybe have you on the nightly
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:05.640]  news and for five minutes and get some other folks on to tell their experiences
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:11.680]  in Ferguson at the hands of the police I appreciate your call listen I grew up in
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:15.840]  Rockwall Texas where later the police and the sheriff got busted dealing drugs
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:21.920]  just like I said they were and they would pull us over and harass us and you
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:26.080]  know pull up at a at a bonfire and find somebody with a six pack of beer and
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:30.160]  arrest them and then we knew the cops were drug dealers but we didn't do drugs
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:34.560]  so they were drug dealers you know but part of the time but then also out
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:40.440]  writing tickets we're like hey you deal drugs you can't write me a ticket I get
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:45.600]  it corrupt police departments are a problem but just running around making
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:48.720]  it a black-white thing is exactly what the system wants I mean it's so obvious
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:52.760]  look I told you in July they're training for this and preparing and did
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:58.520]  emergency alerts that's the point is that brown isn't the poster person the
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:03.960]  poster child for this they want an us against the mentality they want the
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:07.560]  police seeing us all as the enemy so that they can turn them into an army
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:12.960]  against us I don't want to play into the Civil War Cyop David Oregon
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:17.120]  disagrees you're on the air go ahead yeah I got a couple points first thing I
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:22.280]  like to say is first amendment is gone I recently got fired from a job and my
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:28.120]  boss was the Oregon Republican state representative Dallas heard told me I
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:32.040]  didn't have free speech when I was running my mouth and all I did is try to
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:37.560]  wake him up to the fact the New World Order fired the very next day oh yeah you
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:40.560]  know how dare you have free speech how dare you tell your boss and warn about
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:43.640]  something they don't want to hear because they know the stuff's going on and
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:47.320]  and and they want to go along with the party line and they're going to end up
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:52.560]  losing everything in the Republican Party if they continue to sell out with
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:57.280]  the globalist yeah fired me just for merely mentioned in the New World Order
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:01.000]  but and I've been listening to you for a while you woke us up to the fact that
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:06.080]  9-11 is an inside job agenda 21 once is dead the Bohemian Grove exists build a
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:10.080]  bird group all this stuff but yet but but but but don't do anything that's how I
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:14.040]  feel from here lately just you just don't don't do anything you just sit there
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:17.520]  and let him kill us it's self-defense you talk about self-defense what do you
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:23.240]  think's happening right now I think it should lead to more but not pizza
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:28.800]  places or Mexican food restaurants well no I think they should seriously turn
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:33.760]  their anger on to the ones that are causing this you know you know let me
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:37.600]  tell you what really scared them seven eight years ago right before Obama got
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:42.600]  elected the Tea Party was a Ron Paul libertarian movement mad that he'd lost
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:47.600]  my listeners on record Ron Paul said that on air they went out and were
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:51.280]  confronting Republicans and Democrats and saying we're sick of it all so the
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:56.040]  Republicans came in to try to co-opt it they weren't successful overall and the
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:59.400]  media sort of calling it racist and all this to try to keep Democrats from
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:08.680]  joining it okay and they use race again to divide things that's what they're
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:12.560]  scared of can you imagine mobs going whenever a congressman comes to town
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:17.880]  to speak at a grocery store speak at a church can you imagine going and
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:22.400]  demonstrating at their houses can you imagine getting aggressive filing
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:26.720]  lawsuits I mean there's ways to really get them the globalist advertised
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:30.840]  burning your own neighborhood down because it makes you look really stupid
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:35.480]  and it makes businesses not move into your area it is a way to impoverish you
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:39.160]  it's a way to destroy you they created the great society because blacks had more
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:43.280]  successful business districts than most white areas because blacks only shop
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:51.880]  with other blacks they were smart that's not how it works now now they burn out
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:55.240]  anybody that's in the area including blacks because if anybody's got a job
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:59.360]  they're a sellout I appreciate your call sir just like that thug went up to
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:04.520]  jacarion said how dare you be a sellout for Alex Jones I don't sit around tell
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:08.320]  jacarion what to say or do he's a smart guy loves freedom out of a libertarian
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:16.880]  constitutionalist well-spoken works hard I mean he's got a good job because he's a
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:22.880]  good guy he's got talent why shouldn't he be part of an organization should he
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:28.960]  just flip hamburgers he was looking to go into criminal justice maybe he should
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:35.360]  be a jail guard you know or he'll be a black guy behind the bars I mean think
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:40.400]  about that jacari isn't supposed to have a job he doesn't have courage going out
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:46.400]  there and getting shot at and beat up and attacked no he does have courage you
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:49.920]  just got some little thug nobody who just wants to complain about everything
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:58.280]  all day and threaten people and is mad if anybody else is successful that's
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:05.040]  socialism let's go ahead and talk to Mac in South Carolina you're on the oh

[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:59.560]  I just see people that do a great job but I guess that's because I'm a racist
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:04.360]  anyways the Democratic Party wants you to identify racially and that's why
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:07.480]  they're stirring up stuff all over the country whether the brown was shot for a
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:12.400]  good reason or not and when a cop shoots somebody in the wrong we go yeah a cop
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:18.320]  shot him in the wrong the evidence isn't there it is I like due process folks
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:25.840]  I've had people accused me a lot of stuff I didn't do people lie I mean the cop
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:30.720]  may be a big jerk there's a video they claim is him it's a Ferguson cop see
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:34.200]  threatening you know going on basically crack you over the head because your
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:38.520]  video taping me so maybe is a little little spoiled brat coward thug I don't
[02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:47.560]  know but so maybe he's a little spoiled brat and maybe a brown was a big mean
[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:54.360]  thug it's what it looks like to me let's go to Steve no no no max up first
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:59.360]  max thanks for holding you're on the air then Steve hey Alex I think happy to
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:02.520]  you from being a region for here I disagree with you a little bit on two
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:06.640]  points of her today and the first I'm really not trying to be legalistic but
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:10.400]  the term terrorist being thrown around for these criminals in Ferguson and I
[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:14.560]  think that's a dangerous president I that you know gonna call for a lot of
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:18.640]  this military action on the streets and a lot more militarization of police and
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:22.000]  you know the next president we get or something like that it may be you and me
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.560]  out there they're calling terrorists no no I listen I'm the guy that from day
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:29.200]  ones that the Patriot Act will be used on non-terror related cases it's going
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:33.800]  to find everything is terrorism to then use things outside of the legal system
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:38.720]  to come after you but then when people listen it is the definition of
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:42.800]  terrorism to shoot at firefighters that is meant to create fear and terrorize
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:48.440]  folks it so so under that they could be charged but they don't need to be they
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:52.880]  can be charged with attempted murder so I get what you're saying and I totally
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:57.520]  agree with you number two my number two thing I disagree with a little on a
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:03:00.840]  little bit lighter note I want to say happy Thanksgiving to you and I'm not
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:07.280]  really sure that you're not building are you serious what do you think about
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:13.040]  Texas Monthly like doing a whole report on it I don't know it I think it's good
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:16.640]  fodder out there you know you get you a lot of listeners on YouTube and things
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:19.800]  like that so I wouldn't I wouldn't fight it too much well I've already had like
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:23.000]  three or four times over the years I'll be in a restaurant or at the grocery
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:28.080]  store and it's like Bill Bill Bill and I'm sitting there ignoring it and because
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:31.560]  I mean I'm not Bill and then they go hey Alex I turn around they go I was just
[02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:36.640]  seeing your bill X besides you're better looking to bill anyway oh I used to be I
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:42.120]  don't know back when I was Bill Hicks I mean it's just crazy he may have some
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:47.720]  Welsh genetics or something if you ever go up to the Welsh country whales and
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:51.480]  stuff I mean everybody kind of looks like me I think those are the dominant
[02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:58.640]  genes here but I look about as gay like as it gets folks and they'll go hey he's
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:02.920]  gay you know people are so ignorant but I mean I'm not Bill Hicks ladies and
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:07.520]  gentlemen he could look like a cousin maybe I mean he had like dark brown hair
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:12.840]  I got light brown hair now he's be blonde I mean it's just it's just insane but you
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:15.200]  know that they're just gonna say now they've almost got me they've almost
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:21.240]  exposed me anything else yeah well you know I really feel sorry for the folks
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:24.600]  up there getting their places burned down and I just want you know the
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:28.880]  listeners out there just to just be cautious about calling for more force
[02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:33.660]  more force isn't necessarily the right thing in this situation I think the
[02:04:33.660 --> 02:04:38.520]  criminals should be prosecuted in every every instance that this goes on but
[02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:41.240]  you know the cops up there they're walking a tight line you know trying to
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:45.560]  get the criminals out and and and get this whole thing sorted out I think
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:49.800]  eventually it's definitely we saw from the time they put this thing out at 9
[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:53.680]  p.m. the worst night of every drunken drug you just and getting worked up on

[02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:32.880]  the republic from enemies foreign it's alex jones oh man we've got all the
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:39.120]  serious stuff to deal with and a caller just brought this up it's in the magazine
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:44.520]  one of the biggest in the country texas monthly is huge most texas a lot of
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:50.200]  texas subscribe to it and the headline is the conspiracy theory that alex jones
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:55.080]  is actually legendary long dead texas comedian bill hicks and they tongue and
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:09:03.000]  cheek look at it like it could be true we can scroll through it for TV viewers
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.480]  we're gonna post the article up on info wars calm this has been going on five
[02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:12.800]  six years and I know it annoys the family because their son's dead and it's
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:19.120]  pretty painful to have this brought up and it's just it's just crazy it's
[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:23.240]  totally crazy and it shows how people can latch on to something that's a real
[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:30.800]  conspiracy theory and then meanwhile the Federal Reserve is not federal and it's
[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:34.800]  raping the country sucking us dry foreign banks are looting as they're
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:40.640]  shutting down our industrial base half the blacks get aborted in the country
[02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:44.960]  but they're not rioting about that which they should be in my humble view but
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:50.000]  over some guy that appears to be a thug people like Stalin said evil genius that
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:10:00.920]  he was one man is a martyr one man's death is a tragedy 10 million people's
[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:06.200]  deaths is a statistic basically and it's just you can have something that is so
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:12.040]  asinine that is just viral on the internet that I'm bill hicks it's like
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:16.840]  the white supremacists with all this made-up stuff about me lying about me
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:21.720]  constantly I mean it's just crazy and by the way if you knew how the web worked
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:27.760]  idiots it doesn't hurt me that you're doing all that in this world of billions
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:32.520]  of websites and hundreds of millions of people posting every few minutes all of
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:38.200]  your negative attacks only create more buzz people say who is this I better
[02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:42.240]  check this out so they come here to hear what we actually stand for not racism
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:48.000]  against blacks racism against Asians Jews whites Christians I just want
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:51.480]  freedom I'm not Islamophobic but I don't support our government funding
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:55.800]  radical Islamists and then I got attacked by some of the radical Islamists
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:11:00.040]  that I'm anti you know Arab or anti-Islamic I'm just anti tyranny and
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:05.800]  it can come in any shape form or group now that's where I stand we told you
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:09.480]  they're preparing for riots of blacks at the Pentagon training we show the videos
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:14.160]  we show the documents it in July in the articles that are up on info wars comm
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:20.720]  flashback us army training to fight black Americans and then now it's
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:24.680]  happening they don't have major regular army units training and all the role
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:29.120]  players are blacks inner cities unless they're playing in something and then
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:32.440]  they know how to sigh up and take this event and hype it and get folks all
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:36.000]  angry so that you're not angry about all the real stuff that's what I'm saying
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.120]  here
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:43.600]  Steve in New Jersey disagrees he's on the air go ahead
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:48.280]  you know how's it going I just want to say a couple things is the American
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:52.440]  people are tired of this journey and it's not Michael Brown there's countless
[02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:56.720]  other you know police brutality that bad guy who's that black man who was
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:00.640]  strangled to death by the cops I mean the American people are sick of it and
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:04.560]  this is the way they're gonna show house take a turn and would you call the
[02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:10.120]  Patriot back when they dump the team Harvard would you call them Paris they
[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:15.360]  were attacking the direct company East India that had gotten the regulation
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:22.080]  passed outside of law to not let them import tea and they had ships commanding
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:26.520]  British naval forces protecting them seizing their legitimate cargoes being
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:32.000]  brought into Boston and so what they did was a strategic beautiful blow
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:38.320]  directly at the enemy and I support the men that met at the Green Dragon and
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:42.640]  carried out that tea party that is exactly what I explained do people even
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:47.560]  listen to what I'm saying I said if blacks got mad at Planned Parenthood
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:52.320]  founded to murder them founded to exterminate their children founded to
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:56.440]  carry out eugenics in their neighborhoods I would say well you're really going after
[02:12:56.440 --> 02:12:59.760]  the folks that are running the show instead oh they love them because the
[02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:06.200]  Democrats tell them to on average same same deal if people who had their kids
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:10.760]  died from factor eight and bear if and there wasn't justice in that if and I
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:15.720]  might sing do this but I I would say well you know they they hurt people and
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:18.640]  they weren't brought to justice if something but but I wouldn't want to see
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:23.440]  a secretariat bear how about the whoever was in charge at the time who made
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:28.760]  that decision in those audio recordings and texts that came out in court that
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:32.960]  they said so what if it's gonna kill people ship it out those people need to
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:38.960]  be held accountable you bet you bet but I look at the bigger issue the globalist
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:43.080]  want to get a physical war going now before we peacefully hit critical mass
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:47.240]  and awaken the country to the globalist agenda that's happening so I said they
[02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:51.800]  would start a race war to trigger the rebellion that's coming to make it
[02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:58.280]  racial in nature so we're not unified they hijack waves of discontent Julius
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:01.760]  Caesar said there is a time in the affairs of men when taken to the flood
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:08.280]  leads on to fortune an off-quoted statement by here on the broadcast it's
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:12.120]  actually William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar but he was quoting known
[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:15.720]  historical statements of Julius Caesar that you've got to catch fortune at the
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:18.800]  tide there is a tide in the affairs of men when taken to flood leads on the
[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:23.680]  fortune the globalists know that there is a tide of anger people are trying to
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:27.920]  find answers they want to sabotage it make it racial get us fighting with the
[02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:32.360]  police so they can call the military out just like Katrina to take the guns do
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:36.960]  you understand the style do you admit that I predicted all this do you admit
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:41.960]  we told you what was coming next do we get any respect for being right or what
[02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:48.600]  you saying I agree with what you're making but at the same time I mean there's
[02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:52.360]  only so much to American people to pay I mean let's say we do wake up nine of the
[02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:55.320]  population what's going to happen then I mean there's going to be riots there's
[02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:58.080]  going to be protests the people protesting across the country are
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:01.560]  protesting for Michael Brown the person for a bigger cause which is the
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:05.400]  authorization of our police yeah the two wrongs don't make a right and this will
[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:08.440]  cause more militarization of police because now they can show them being
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:11.760]  shot at and the armored vehicles protecting them let's expand on that
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:21.520]  let's expand on that if police like it lexington and concord start firing first
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:26.640]  it's called the shot heard around the world so at Waco the feds are all on
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:30.240]  video and Waco rules of engagement their own videos that came out in trial we're
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:34.320]  gonna get more funding it's gonna be fun taking out these cooks they could have
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:37.560]  picked up David Koresh anytime in town they said all these lies and
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:41.080]  exaggerations I didn't like David Koresh by the way and you know studying it but
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:44.200]  they didn't deserve to kill those babies is my point they went out there to start
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:48.360]  their war against the American people kicking it off against a good target you
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:51.920]  know a bunch of religious weirdos in their view hanging out in some compound
[02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:57.920]  they pull up they opened fire on record the dividends fired back against people
[02:15:57.920 --> 02:16:01.040]  trying to kill them and under common law that was their right so then they sit in
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:08.960]  the Delta Force to murder everybody and that's shameful 1993 day 51 if you had a
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:14.000]  building full of black people and they were shot at first and they shot back I
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:17.800]  would say even if I didn't agree with whatever weird group they were part of
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:23.600]  that they were in the right that's why I stood up for the dividends and have and
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:30.440]  know them well so again you don't because there's a suspicious shooting by a cop
[02:16:30.440 --> 02:16:34.400]  you don't say hey we're gonna get your family or we're gonna kill other cops on
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:40.400]  the department that's not how it works anything else yeah I just I just want to
[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:44.400]  say like back when Michael Brown was shot the protests and rides that followed
[02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:48.520]  they exposed the military nation police even their Obama administration so we
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:53.600]  need to look at this even at the Obama administration who made sure they got
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:56.640]  the armored vehicles they had bizarre training with them two years before in
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:17:00.920]  Ferguson and surrounding areas they were gauging the crowd they have computer
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:15.840]  models of who they think is gonna have an uprising this is a Psyop sir if the
[02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:20.600]  if the rebels would have fired first at Lexington Concord we might not have had
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:24.600]  the moral high ground and lost the Revolutionary War do you understand and
[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:29.240]  I love people out there that have I see it on the Internet Alex Jones says take
[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:34.440]  punishment take abuse that's what Christ did that's what Gandhi did at key
[02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:39.280]  points it destroys the enemy when they are clearly the villain it's like Obi
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:43.120]  Wong Kenobi let's Darth Vader cut him in half why does he do that because he
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:49.960]  wants to inspire that next group people just don't understand how the world
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:53.960]  really works look at Martin Luther King he's a much greater man because he was
[02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:59.120]  nonviolent was killed Malcolm X started preaching nonviolent so they killed
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:05.480]  him hoping for uprisings they want the uprisings it's in Psyop manuals that are
[02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:10.360]  declassified I'm an expert on this but you don't even have to be an expert you
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:15.800]  can go become one I appreciate your call Steve I know everybody's mad but when
[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:21.000]  the Civil War starts and you don't have gasoline or heating and Obama becomes a
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:27.840]  dictator they win and then you're gonna celebrate 300,000 dead cops that doesn't
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:32.840]  do anything to the globalist that war criminal Soros will still be running
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:38.080]  around Johnny in California go ahead
[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:44.880]  yes I know an Alex isn't the answer to tyranny 1776 I mean we look at the
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:49.480]  Black Panther Party it did try to do things peacefully follow the the
[02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:55.280]  amendments right to bear arms they were dismantled by the FBI Co until pro I mean
[02:18:55.280 --> 02:18:59.120]  look at if peace pieces the answer then why don't we give up our guns now and
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:03.400]  just everybody lay down and let the next generation that's not the answer
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:07.600]  that's not the answer we get more guns we get more ready we educate people we
[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:12.440]  reach out to the police and military we wake them up we don't let us be played
[02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:19.240]  off against each other so we need that we need to fight now this is the time
[02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:24.320]  everybody's already organizing now everybody's ready to go now why aren't
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:27.840]  you calling for right right when I'm gonna come back to you after break this
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:33.920]  is so important don't hang up Johnny folks this is incredible they picked a
[02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:38.120]  case where the guy was a thug they picked a case where the system has the
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:42.960]  moral high ground they picked a fake lexington concord they picked Ferguson
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:48.040]  as a style you notice the fed stood down and backed off in the Bundy Ranch
[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:51.400]  because it didn't look right a bunch of cowboys riding up against guys threatened
[02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:55.840]  to shoot them they backed off there cuz it wasn't where they could win this is a

[02:23:31.080 --> 02:23:36.040]  like your smoke alarm detecting measuring and monitoring nuclear radiation made

[02:23:59.960 --> 02:24:05.560]  the Genesis communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones
[02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:11.520]  show because there's a war on for your mind. A lot of people see this as a
[02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:16.960]  referendum of police being above the law so hey let's go out and riot that'll
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:22.600]  show them. Now that only bolsters the worst elements of the system that wants
[02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:28.960]  to control the police. I mean I look at the board it says Johnny in California
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:31.600]  disagrees who was it I was just talking to I want him to finish her statement
[02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:36.440]  I'm gonna go back to Johnny James disagrees says Alex is being racist I'm
[02:24:36.440 --> 02:24:43.000]  going to him next then Bob in Montana Richard in Ohio Victor in California. I
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:48.760]  wanted people to hear the mentality though of folks that are angry they
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:55.280]  sound like they're legitimately upset but at the same time they just don't have
[02:24:55.280 --> 02:25:03.440]  logic in my view that attacking Papa John's you know a white lady who makes
[02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:09.000]  $12 an hour I mean does she deserve to be physically punched and attacked because
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:15.960]  she has a $12 an hour job or other cops standard they need to be shot at. See they
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:19.520]  want to get us killing each other it's so elementary. In fact queue up for the
[02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:23.000]  next segment the James Bond clip from Russia would love about the Siamese
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:26.800]  fighting fish I'm gonna try to explain this to people again I know our general
[02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:32.680]  audience understands it but the police actually were brainwashed that there was
[02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:36.600]  no new world order no foreign takeover no police state coming they now see it
[02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:41.720]  happening they now are the easiest people next to the military to wake up
[02:25:41.720 --> 02:25:45.360]  that's got the globalist worried so they want to turn us against the police
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:49.320]  and military so that when Obama comes in with dictatorial decrees which are
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:55.560]  already happening maybe even becoming dictator they can have their Democratic
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:25:59.640]  Party operative stir up the inner cities have folks attack the police so they'll
[02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:04.000]  go under federal control begging for troops to come in then Obama who's
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:12.880]  playing the part of the savior to his own rioters can roll in as the savior it's
[02:26:12.880 --> 02:26:17.520]  called a Higelian dialectic it's very sophisticated psyops it's very simple at
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:22.000]  one level but very sophisticated another and I understand a lot of police are
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:25.720]  corrupt and above the law people are angry about it I've made four police
[02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:30.720]  state films but I saw this coming a thousand miles away it's now happening
[02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:36.160]  and it's bad for everybody but the globalist I don't care how much money
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:40.320]  you make where you live what color you are this is bad do you you're obviously
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:43.680]  listeners have you been listening is what I'm asking you can you want to go
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:48.200]  watch the July report I did warning of all this unfolding I can see what's
[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:55.240]  next what I would play if I was them I study this I'm not bragging I know what
[02:26:55.240 --> 02:27:00.520]  I'm talking about how many times do I have to be right if all this kicks off
[02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:03.720]  into a real civil war we're trying to stop it right now I'm just keeping my
[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:07.560]  head down okay I'm not going to be in the middle of this this is all meant to
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:10.720]  bring in tyranny so they can come arrest me I'm telling you and go after Ron Paul
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:14.920]  and the real opposition of the globalist you understand that they want to
[02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:18.640]  twist things so they can bring in so much tyranny they can go after the real
[02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:24.760]  opposition state governors and people like that that want to stop this the
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:27.840]  Liberty movement has people everywhere and the globalists know it and are
[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:31.000]  scared we're very close to taking the country back does that mean it'll be
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:34.960]  perfect no but we're close to getting groups of people in office that don't
[02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:39.800]  want to destroy the country and that's a big improvement I just got chills I don't
[02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:44.080]  think I'm gonna be able to stop it though God Almighty go ahead Johnny and
[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:49.560]  finish up Alex and why are we not promoting for these for these people in
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:52.960]  these neighborhoods yeah don't not to burn down to these these buildings and

[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:48.720]  wanted freedom and we're looking for something the Indians were constant the
[02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:51.840]  natives were constantly killing each other trying to team up with different
[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:56.360]  groups just like whites were doing in Europe the same behavior so I don't

[02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:40.200]  cari jackson and joe bags are back from combat ten days in Ferguson Missouri it's now spreading around the country this is george sorrells the
[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:43.560]  democratic party have planned it's all they've got it's just hoping for an
[02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:48.920]  uprising classic communist tactic being used by foreign banks to work other
[02:33:48.920 --> 02:33:52.440]  places one on here and they've got demonstrations starting up then the
[02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:55.880]  police can put it down and then either the police state comes in and they get
[02:33:55.880 --> 02:33:59.440]  total control the globalist or they actually have a socialist communist
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:03.760]  overthrow then a civil war starts and then after the police and military are
[02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:07.000]  chewed up in a five-year war which the rand corporation's been preparing for
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:11.120]  then they bring in the UN troops as Henry Kissinger said and the public is
[02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:17.000]  thankful for it to quote his address in 1991 at Bilderberg in avian france when
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:21.040]  presented with this scenario riot civil unrest individual rights will be
[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:25.040]  willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:30.480]  their world government Henry Kissinger front page of info wars calm the
[02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:35.920]  problem is if most the country has guns you can't have total widespread
[02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:43.800]  anarchy even if you order the police stand down hence take the guns and this
[02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:46.800]  is just disgusting that this is happening the police were ordered to stand
[02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:50.680]  down there under federal control the governor said that the National Guard
[02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:53.760]  was stopped until they could get it stirred up and now the democrats are
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:57.760]  launching all over the country I guess for a Thanksgiving surprise we are
[02:34:57.760 --> 02:35:02.000]  joined and then we'll go to James first who disagrees and says that I'm being
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:07.880]  racist I can't wait to hear this and then we'll go to Rob Richard Stan and
[02:35:07.880 --> 02:35:11.920]  John by the time the broadcast ends but but I'm not just covering this guys
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:17.360]  because it's interesting story it's a microcosm into how media works how
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:22.320]  psyops work I'm not bragging again to the audience info wars calm go to my
[02:35:22.320 --> 02:35:27.720]  July 17th special alert TV news were peace the next day Watson an article
[02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:34.160]  predicting this because when the big red one when the standard army is training
[02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:38.520]  with role players who every one of them are black and practicing throwing them
[02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:44.800]  in FEMA camps hearing civil unrest why would there be a big black uprising
[02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:49.960]  because the media is hyping this up and there is the only racism here is the
[02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:54.160]  undertone to seccept the police state and troops on the street as a major
[02:35:54.160 --> 02:35:58.040]  general is now called for on CNN by stirring up an inner city black
[02:35:58.040 --> 02:36:01.360]  community and the media throwing fires saying they should be out there they
[02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:07.480]  should be angry CNN and others up until now defending violence calling it
[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:12.720]  protesting to then demonize protesting itself then that scares white
[02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:16.680]  communities middle-class communities you name it into accepting the police state
[02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:23.360]  and then having soft racism because of what they've seen all manipulated by the
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:27.400]  globalist that's how they operate problem reaction solution so jacari
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:31.760]  Jackson is back Joe Biggs is back jacari you just said quite a bit
[02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:34.960]  they're in the break when you walked in here about the guys that were around you
[02:36:34.960 --> 02:36:38.960]  kind of threatening and stuff I mean repeat what you said earlier you also
[02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:42.960]  talked about folks that always want you know us to go out and call for violence
[02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:46.320]  but or somebody else to go out and do it jacari that's pretty much what
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:50.240]  happened last night I was confronted by some guy and he says hey you're jacari
[02:36:50.240 --> 02:36:53.200]  Jackson so yeah he said you work for Alex Jones I said yeah he said Alex Jones
[02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:56.560]  is out here calling us terrorist I said well he said he's out here calling black
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:37:00.280]  people terrorist I said no the issue is the people who are out here burning down
[02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:03.520]  the buildings looting the boost mobile store that's the people who are the
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:07.040]  problem not because the color of your skin and then you know that it's this
[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:10.200]  older guy he's probably about five six or whatever and the whole time he's yelling
[02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:13.080]  loud and he's you know doing this thing hey come over here come over here and
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:16.120]  then you know he didn't want to fight you want to get about you want to get you
[02:37:16.120 --> 02:37:18.840]  wanted other people to come over there then the other guys who came over they
[02:37:18.840 --> 02:37:21.720]  were at least willing to hear me out and I said hey this is what this guy has to
[02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:24.880]  say this is what I have to say and you know they were you know they're excited
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:27.640]  you know they're getting into the thing but they weren't you know so much bowing
[02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:31.040]  up to me and that's when the guys are you scared I say am I scared to you and
[02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:35.160]  then he is arguing pretty much fell apart because then Joe came over there
[02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:39.040]  and he was like there's Joe Biggs he's saying this and that and Biggs is like
[02:37:39.040 --> 02:37:43.200]  no and you know the hardest thing this time around is just convincing people
[02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:46.360]  that we weren't police or whatever you know the first couple days we get there
[02:37:46.360 --> 02:37:49.320]  we're dressed in black we have body armor on and all that stuff and the
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:52.400]  people who didn't recognize this from the first time they're real skeptical of
[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:55.400]  our presence but then after a couple days they heard about us they went back
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:58.960]  and watched some of our interviews and reports from August and then they kind of
[02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:02.320]  loosened up around this so a lot of people weren't really going for it but
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:04.800]  for the people who didn't know who the people the people who would just believe
[02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:07.760]  anything that somebody talking loud would believe they kind of fell in with this
[02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:10.680]  guy but it wasn't that many people he was trying to provocateur it looked to me
[02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:14.120]  like a fight yeah he was the same guy that was there the night before too right
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:17.360]  before the the riot broke out he was sitting there right against the metal
[02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:21.200]  barricade screaming and cussing at the cops saying he was gonna get him it was
[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:23.760]  the same guy all I do is change well it's good you didn't show fear though when
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:26.400]  those other guys were like you said earlier when more came over you just
[02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:29.320]  said all right I'm ready to fight I mean I didn't I wasn't out there looking for
[02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:33.840]  a fight but you know I'm not a real kind of back down guy you know I was like you
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:36.480]  know we if it's gonna go to that point that's the thing I spent when there's
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:40.640]  more people you almost feel tougher it's like you you want to gang up on me
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:44.280]  I'm you know yeah I mean but the guys who came over the the younger guys they
[02:38:44.280 --> 02:38:47.360]  weren't so much bowing up to me they were disagreeing with me which you know
[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:49.960]  it is fine they were sticking their fingers in your face at first yeah I
[02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:52.640]  mean but they chilled out they you know just some young and spot excitable guys
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:56.240]  oh that guy was lying to him yeah yeah it was the guy that the older guy in the
[02:38:56.240 --> 02:38:59.080]  brown ski mask he has to wear two masks to walk down the street in his own
[02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:02.360]  neighborhood he's the one trying to kick up stuff not doubted even his own
[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:05.520]  neighborhood he's probably from somewhere else well that's he claimed he was a
[02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:09.480]  resident but he claims a lot of people do do yeah and then he was telling you to
[02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:14.040]  go and he was he's like yeah get out of here and I'm like you came in my face
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:17.840]  I'm not backing down and that's when the guys came over and he just was oh my
[02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:21.400]  gosh he's not backing down and then I don't know how those guys maybe you're
[02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:24.840]  talking to him Joe the Danish guys they came over they came up to me and they
[02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:27.800]  started filming us I'm like and I just thought they were filming the scene he's
[02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:30.320]  like no we're doing the thing an alternative media so we'll be on Danish
[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:37.120]  TV and good job your take on the situation Joe it's now spreading all over
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:41.080]  the country I mean it's spiraled out of control I mean this is no longer a
[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:46.440]  protest I mean there's there's some people out there that are protesting and
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:50.160]  that's fine and dandy but then when a lot of these outsiders come in inside
[02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:54.080]  violence start burning stuff down that's we're gonna draw the line but it is
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:58.320]  terrorism to shoot at fire department people oh yeah I mean it's the definition
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:01.080]  I was literally filming there I was standing right behind the truck and I
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:05.120]  could hear it yeah I could see the looks on their faces as they were like tears
[02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:08.760]  and sad and angry at the same time because they wanted to help save that
[02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:12.200]  business in their community and they weren't able to they had no protection
[02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:15.760]  and they were being shot at by a bunch of outsiders who are acting like a bunch
[02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:18.840]  of hoodlums and that's the thing that I wanted to touch on we talked about this
[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:22.920]  a lot but we can't stress it enough that a lot of the people out there weren't
[02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:25.760]  from that community the people who were out there you know looting the
[02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:28.880]  businesses and tearing stuff up there are a lot of good decent people in
[02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:33.160]  Missouri we met plenty of them all race races age when you were there last week
[02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:36.640]  folks were saying this is a sigh up stir everybody up yeah the real locals were
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:39.920]  saying yeah we talked to people at the grocery store and they were like yeah we
[02:40:39.920 --> 02:40:43.000]  we want this to be over but we think people are stirring up we got outside
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:46.120]  provocateurs coming in and trying to burn the city down burning the city down
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:49.920]  isn't going to help anything you know in and now you got Democratic Party known
[02:40:49.920 --> 02:40:53.440]  groups all over the country running this what do you think they're planning I
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:57.560]  just think they want to see the collapse of the city you know I'm I don't know
[02:40:57.560 --> 02:41:02.320]  why they want so bad to wound this city any more than what it already has been
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:06.760]  but some people want that I guess they profit off that in some way it's beyond
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:10.480]  that now they start calling military to these other cities as well I mean that's
[02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:14.640]  what they want martial law they want a reason to have all these police and the
[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:18.000]  heavy armor and the tear can you hand me that tear gas canister out here because
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:21.940]  they keep lying and saying that they didn't use this is a CS gas well that
[02:41:21.940 --> 02:41:25.680]  the problem that then the government lies they're bad too yeah because they're
[02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:30.080]  behind it yeah so I mean it's it's a lot of blame to go around but it's not
[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:32.840]  everybody in the crowd is bad there's bad people in the crowd there's good
[02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:35.480]  people in the crowd same thing with the police the police were really bad in
[02:41:35.480 --> 02:41:38.680]  August this time around they were much more calm you guys glad to be home had
[02:41:38.680 --> 02:41:42.920]  much better leadership yeah it's it is nice to be back home yeah there you go
[02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:46.280]  you know band and war but they can use them in Ferguson, Missouri and then they
[02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:52.840]  said we didn't use these and then Joe gave my earful yeah I mean it says CS gas
[02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:58.400]  and then on there it says do not use on you there we were criticized in the
[02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:01.480]  police when they shot Joe with rubber bullets and you with tear gas and how
[02:42:01.480 --> 02:42:04.760]  they lied so they were helping the TV crews and they took their cameras algae
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:08.300]  zero and but now oh we were great then but we were still criticized on the
[02:42:08.300 --> 02:42:13.520]  looters now that it's clearly you know really dangerous people getting killed
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:18.520]  and stuff oh now you know jacari you're a sellout because you don't want to shoot
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:22.700]  fire department people no I don't eggs you know expect anybody go out there and
[02:42:22.700 --> 02:42:26.640]  shoot a fire department official or burn down a building or loot a boost
[02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:30.280]  mobile store you know in a lot of people they have animosity towards Darren
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:33.680]  Wilson in that area but I'm like what is looting the boost mobile store gonna do
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:37.440]  to do anything to Darren Wilson well the suspicious thing about all these fires
[02:42:37.440 --> 02:42:40.640]  though too like I said the doors were locked the firefighters had to use
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:45.440]  chainsaws to try to get in so how is there a fire in the cell of the building
[02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:47.740]  it might not have been the justice department doing it though they're
[02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:51.200]  prime suspects they've been caught doing false flags like fast and furious
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:55.880]  business owners could have used as a cover to get insurance money there's a
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:42:58.840]  possibility yeah I mean I mean who believes they would torch the black
[02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:04.200]  church well that's the where the pastor was I believe it's already had 75 death
[02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:09.040]  threats and the FBI was actually investigating 75 threats since back in
[02:43:09.040 --> 02:43:13.880]  August and why is he having the threats just for speaking out about what's
[02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:17.440]  going on just saying hey everybody you know cooler heads will prevail yeah he
[02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:22.160]  wanted a calmer solution oh so he's not stirring it up yeah yeah pretty much he's
[02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:26.800]  probably racist too then yeah I mean for casting that's kind of what it is
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:29.880]  it's it's it's gotten to the point where even you know black people are doing that
[02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:33.360]  against other black people because they have no argument you're racist I'm like
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:37.280]  I got tear gas with these guys I walk with these guys I got chased by m-wrapped
[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:40.320]  with these guys so you know you know people know that they can go watch those
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:43.480]  videos and just see if this guy just wanted yeah well it's not just inner
[02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:47.480]  city places that are dumbed down the general public's either awake or
[02:43:47.480 --> 02:43:51.640]  totally dumb I mean I talk to people all the time white black Hispanic who can't
[02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:55.440]  even talk I mean they've got a job they even drive a nice car but they don't
[02:43:55.440 --> 02:43:58.720]  know what planet they're on but they can tell you about every TV show remember
[02:43:58.720 --> 02:44:01.440]  they were like don't worry this won't affect dancing with the stars two days
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:06.440]  ago I saw that in the news like who cares you know people want to see that
[02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:10.600]  dancing with the stars I guess well there are some dancing around and
[02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:13.720]  some stars going off you can call them flashbangs though the other night that
[02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:17.600]  was a that's one of those events like I said you'll never get that out of your
[02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:22.120]  mind that was crazy just like that happened in America on the streets
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:25.560]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of police officers walking up and down the
[02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:29.080]  road and then last night going back out and seeing that road and it's just dead
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:32.480]  there's nothing they have the entire national guard locked off because the
[02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:35.640]  entire street is a crime scene well I just have folks calling in and I
[02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:38.880]  appreciate them calling in I respect what they have to say but why don't you
[02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:43.160]  want to get something done Alex you know what I mean ruining a black
[02:44:43.160 --> 02:44:47.200]  neighborhood that doesn't know the issue I I encounter a lot that you know any
[02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:51.600]  demonstration I go to you know that you always have a I guess the the hotheads
[02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:54.920]  and they they always want you to go out and start the violence you know kind of
[02:44:54.920 --> 02:44:58.160]  like this guy last night you know he wanted other people to come over and
[02:44:58.160 --> 02:45:01.440]  get involved he didn't want to do it himself and but you have that in many
[02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:05.440]  different scenarios they let's go do it's not I'm gonna go you know burn the
[02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:09.160]  that guy was such a wimp though when you said well no I'm not backing off or
[02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:14.400]  watch it he's he like actually step back I mean it's ridiculous I mean it's not
[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:17.600]  even about that guy because I don't want this to be about me it's more about the
[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:21.120]  people but he's a microcosm he's a microcosm but you know that's there's
[02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:24.760]  still people out there protesting and trying to get you know their point
[02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:28.360]  across whatever that may be well whatever we're here to bring people
[02:45:28.360 --> 02:45:31.160]  together against tyranny to promote the Bill of Rights and Constitution and
[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:34.960]  let's talk to James in Pennsylvania disagrees you're on the air thanks for
[02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:41.320]  calling in sir Alex how are you you know I have a big issue with with what
[02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:46.280]  you're saying you know you know the implications of labeling someone or
[02:45:46.280 --> 02:45:51.480]  people terrorists in our society today but yet you didn't use the term hoodlum
[02:45:51.480 --> 02:45:56.040]  you didn't say thugs you called them terrorists there was a coward out here
[02:45:56.040 --> 02:46:01.520]  who shot he snipered the the state troopers over here he was a coward you
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:06.360]  can call him a terrorist or anybody like actually I did actually I did I said I
[02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:11.120]  said I think I said about three weeks ago I said the get his name he was
[02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:15.800]  obsessed with like Russian military or something a World War one he wanted to
[02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:18.560]  he was obviously mentally ill but you could define it as that because he went
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:23.080]  out cold-bloodedly just to kill somebody to terrorize people and he was
[02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:27.200]  white and I said this is terrorism and look at how they've shut down everything
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:31.800]  in total fear I know they're applying terrorist laws to things that aren't
[02:46:31.800 --> 02:46:35.920]  terrorism like marijuana and things and I trailblazed getting cities and
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:38.360]  counties and states that said they wouldn't enforce the Patriot Act
[02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:43.880]  literally but I'm I'm not even the point is I said the police should be you're
[02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:47.440]  missing the one I said and I'm sorry if I talk fast it's my fault let me say
[02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:51.920]  this way go back to yesterday what I said is the police not protecting the
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:56.640]  firefighters are libel and they're becoming cowards following those orders
[02:46:56.640 --> 02:47:01.560]  this is a stand-down because it's terrorism to try to shoot firefighters and
[02:47:01.560 --> 02:47:06.600]  by the definition of old-fashioned terrorism before 9-11 carrying out
[02:47:06.600 --> 02:47:10.320]  violence for political aim threatened to kill people is the definition you can
[02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:14.880]  pull it up that's a paraphrase trying to shoot firefighters is the lowest thing
[02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:20.520]  I can think of it's just totally ridiculous there's the definition the
[02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:24.320]  use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims Joe Beggs you
[02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:27.240]  want to comment we'll go back to James yes I mean when you're shooting at
[02:47:27.240 --> 02:47:30.200]  firefighters that's terrorism when you're going out there and you're burning
[02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:33.400]  down people's businesses yes not everybody out there I never said that
[02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:36.560]  black people were terrorists I said that the people who were committing those
[02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:40.840]  crimes those were acts of terrorism because you're you're putting people and
[02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:46.760]  the FBI at Waco the ATF was an act of terrorism yeah I mean I just don't know
[02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:52.480]  how how you can't understand that that that you that you're shocked by the fact
[02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:55.600]  that someone would call that no but see there's solidarity he's saying that it
[02:47:55.600 --> 02:48:00.000]  demonized no the people shooting there are demonizing the protest exactly with
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:03.720]  every right to be there and who we were supportive of overall you understand we're
[02:48:03.720 --> 02:48:08.480]  trying to stop the feds told the police to stand down so they could let
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:14.880]  criminals run wild to demonize the people you understand the psyopser yeah I
[02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:20.000]  do and and I agree with you that it might be a Psyup I have no argument with
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:25.640]  you there but what you're using terms pre 9-11 when we're that's like calling us
[02:48:25.640 --> 02:48:30.520]  Negroes we don't use those terms anymore for you to label us terrorists it puts
[02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:36.320]  us in that category in 2014 well there are a bunch of white white drag rat
[02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:40.480]  trust fund trendy anarchists running around they're probably the ones burning
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:44.120]  stuff because I've dealt with them a lot over the years they probably working for
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:48.640]  the feds so let's get one thing straight I wasn't implying that black people are
[02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:55.760]  terrorists the act you hear what I'm saying James I hear what you're saying
[02:48:55.760 --> 02:48:59.800]  I just I listen to you every now and then and I've never heard you use the
[02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:03.520]  word the word terrorist well I was getting mad at firefighters getting shot
[02:49:03.520 --> 02:49:07.360]  at and just said the cops should do something here you have terrorism and
[02:49:07.360 --> 02:49:12.520]  they're sitting on their fat butts I have no argue like I said that these
[02:49:12.520 --> 02:49:16.200]  hoodlums these bugs that are out nobody could justify that and by no means am I
[02:49:16.200 --> 02:49:23.440]  saying that I just have disagreement with you using the word terrorist I hear
[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:28.040]  you I hear you and it caused the debate I wanted okay but I I hear you I
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:32.160]  appreciate your call jacari no I was just asking the gentleman if it was just a
[02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:35.640]  semantic issue because he said you know if you would call them thugs or you know
[02:49:35.640 --> 02:49:38.520]  looters or whatever else he wouldn't have an issue with that I guess it's just
[02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:43.480]  the word but I mean look they call being a patriot or promoting liberty
[02:49:43.480 --> 02:49:47.280]  terrorism or suing the cops paper terrorism they've expanded it to stuff
[02:49:47.280 --> 02:49:51.600]  isn't terrorism I was saying this is terrorism it's definitely criminal to
[02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:55.400]  maliciously burn down a building or to shoot at firefighters it's meant to
[02:49:55.400 --> 02:49:58.920]  create fear it's meant to run them out so you can commit more crime and take
[02:49:58.920 --> 02:50:05.880]  over that's terrorism I mean I don't know how else to explain it to people we're
[02:50:05.880 --> 02:50:08.080]  gonna go to break and come back we'll do a little bit of overdrive with these

[02:54:16.360 --> 02:54:24.800]  for calling Rob hi um Alex is gone then see there yeah he's just stepped up for
[02:54:24.800 --> 02:54:31.680]  a second okay I've been listening for years I I pray for Alex and his family
[02:54:31.680 --> 02:54:38.440]  and the staff and guests and the listeners every night thank you I agree
[02:54:38.440 --> 02:54:42.040]  with nearly I agree with nearly you're welcome I agree with nearly a hundred
[02:54:42.040 --> 02:54:49.560]  percent of what Alex says almost I almost never disagree with him no one's
[02:54:49.560 --> 02:54:54.760]  against this satanic new world order more than I am and it unless we start
[02:54:54.760 --> 02:55:04.080]  addressing it spiritually as a a satanic new world order run by Luciferians we
[02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:11.040]  will never conquer this thing well I do agree that spirituality does help oh you
[02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:14.400]  know it is a spiritual battle ultimately you know referencing the book of
[02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:19.200]  revelations so I don't disagree disagree with your point I guess my
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:25.560]  question is what what were you disagreeing with well I was disagreeing
[02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:31.960]  with Alex in the fact that none of us know exactly what happened on that day
[02:55:31.960 --> 02:55:37.480]  when Michael Brown when Michael Brown was shot none of us know exactly what
[02:55:37.480 --> 02:55:43.000]  happened now the first thing that just struck me it was it kind of took me
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:49.280]  back to the Aurora Colorado the theater shooting I remember the morning I
[02:55:49.280 --> 02:55:55.880]  turned on the news and they said that this kid kicked in the door okay I'm a
[02:55:55.880 --> 02:56:02.800]  builder commercials doors open outward I knew I knew I mean the red flags went
[02:56:02.800 --> 02:56:08.240]  off I was okay then I thought a gorilla it would take a gorilla to get this door
[02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:13.200]  off the hinges okay so I knew that that was crap okay it's the same thing here
[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:18.720]  when you now let me let me see if we can we can reverse this
[02:56:18.720 --> 02:56:24.640]  let me ask some other college so please make your point okay I'm sorry I'll make
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:31.920]  my point real quick here if this were if this were reversed and this young man
[02:56:31.920 --> 02:56:36.760]  Michael Brown was armed legally let's say a sidearm it was visible he was and
[02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:42.600]  and this cop came at him and he felt threatened for his life and he shot the
[02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:47.680]  cop and he killed him not only would he be indicted he would be taken to the
[02:56:47.680 --> 02:56:52.400]  county jail he would be the crap beat out him by six or seven cop then he'd be
[02:56:52.400 --> 02:56:57.800]  held there until they decided what to do with him and he would definitely be
[02:56:57.800 --> 02:57:01.360]  indicted now the prosecutor here the first thing he did was he gave
[02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:05.640]  instructions to the grand jury this this is a special case this is different than
[02:57:05.640 --> 02:57:10.720]  the rest here's how you're to handle this why wasn't he at least and indicted
[02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:15.280]  and then goes through a trial and let's look at all the other I agree with that
[02:57:15.280 --> 02:57:18.960]  listen listen listen I agree with that I had to step out and sign some stuff you
[02:57:18.960 --> 02:57:22.600]  are absolutely right there is corruption in the system that police
[02:57:22.600 --> 02:57:27.680]  department should be 70% black there's a lot of issues the point is the feds
[02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:31.800]  know there's injustice they're trying to sigh up to all get us fighting with each
[02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:35.440]  other because they know we could take the country back and fix a lot of these
[02:57:35.440 --> 02:57:39.640]  problems that's what I keep trying to get at is the sigh up I appreciate your
[02:57:39.640 --> 02:57:43.240]  call and I agree with that guy as far as the the analogy he made if Michael Brown
[02:57:43.240 --> 02:57:47.120]  had a gun I mean I agree with that 100% I guess I just wasn't understanding what
[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:51.080]  he was disagreeing with well let me just say they disagree so they can get it to
[02:57:51.080 --> 02:57:55.640]  have a lot of we've had some folks that legitimately you know disagree let me see
[02:57:55.640 --> 02:57:59.520]  with the like Richard says he disagrees on minor points John just says he

[03:00:52.120 --> 03:00:57.280]  believe anything now yeah I had a guy email me the other day he's like because
[03:00:57.280 --> 03:01:00.640]  I was joking with Paul on his Facebook page is like yeah I'm a reptilian
[03:01:00.640 --> 03:01:05.000]  shapeshifter to and the guy emailed me he goes are you really just be honest are
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:10.320]  you here to harm the humans I was like it's serious people believe what they
[03:01:10.320 --> 03:01:15.040]  want and then that's usually discredit us yeah we have the army documents that
[03:01:15.040 --> 03:01:19.160]  are public that they're setting all this up nobody cares about that yeah like
[03:01:19.160 --> 03:01:23.560]  all the official Kim trail admissions nobody cares but it's huge viral story
[03:01:23.560 --> 03:01:28.560]  that I'm Bill Hicks I'll come clean I am okay that's the contrary there'll be 10
[03:01:28.560 --> 03:01:37.520]  videos tomorrow really I'm 51 that's what he would be I guess I don't look
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:42.840]  family older than 40 but man maybe 45 I'm well how old you say I looked you
[03:01:42.840 --> 03:01:51.440]  card probably 40 41 yeah 49 40 50 60 70 I was like I'm a woman you look you're
[03:01:51.440 --> 03:01:58.320]  20 Alex Richard no hi well you're on minor points but go ahead hello can
[03:01:58.320 --> 03:02:02.880]  hear me I sure can you're talking to Bill Hicks right now I I'm a big
[03:02:02.880 --> 03:02:06.920]  supporter of you I sell your I don't sell your magazine I buy it from you 50
[03:02:06.920 --> 03:02:10.320]  issues at a time and put them out front of my house with a magazine rack I made
[03:02:10.320 --> 03:02:14.800]  it's weatherproof awesome we sell them at cost brother thank you I also go at
[03:02:14.800 --> 03:02:19.920]  events all over Cincinnati and give away constitutional handbook you're a
[03:02:19.920 --> 03:02:24.320]  hardcore patriot we love you but you disagree go ahead I disagree with your
[03:02:24.320 --> 03:02:30.520]  use of terms calling the emotional rioters terrorists simply because it
[03:02:30.520 --> 03:02:36.160]  feeds into the rhetoric of the horror mainstream media you know what I think
[03:02:36.160 --> 03:02:40.360]  you're probably right but I was just making the point choice the words at
[03:02:40.360 --> 03:02:44.400]  that time but I also would like to make another point and that is these people
[03:02:44.400 --> 03:02:47.840]  are dominated by fear so they're emotional they're not thinking logically
[03:02:47.840 --> 03:02:54.800]  and I suggested in your you know stories news suggestions or whatever you call
[03:02:54.800 --> 03:03:01.160]  it that you post pictures of all of the past maybe three years of people who
[03:03:01.160 --> 03:03:05.640]  were killed unarmed by cops so that they can be reprinted and taken to these
[03:03:05.640 --> 03:03:10.440]  protests so it's not just about Mike Brown and one cop or the situations that
[03:03:10.440 --> 03:03:15.040]  are so ambiguous well exactly the globalist want to sigh up victory not
[03:03:15.040 --> 03:03:19.200]  for the police but for the police state to take over the police and so they need
[03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:23.440]  this case where Brown looks like he's not the best poster child so that they
[03:03:23.440 --> 03:03:27.400]  can glaze over all the other stuff like they were trying to get Dorner and they
[03:03:27.400 --> 03:03:31.640]  were like shooting up yeah white women in blue trucks it wouldn't even just
[03:03:31.640 --> 03:03:35.080]  randomly I mean I mean yeah there are a lot of people out there that shouldn't
[03:03:35.080 --> 03:03:38.560]  be police I mean they're just crazy mm-hmm and sir more to your point you're
[03:03:38.560 --> 03:03:41.960]  saying that we should put a lot of that stuff out I've done I cannot give a
[03:03:41.960 --> 03:03:45.880]  realistic number of how many police brutality stories I have stories about
[03:03:45.880 --> 03:03:49.440]  them shooting dogs I mean all kinds of stuff you can find all dogs yeah you can
[03:03:49.440 --> 03:03:52.760]  find that stuff on on our YouTube yeah people are always like you need to cover
[03:03:52.760 --> 03:03:56.840]  the Federal Reserve you know it's private I'm like oh no you ever hear
[03:03:56.840 --> 03:04:02.560]  9-11 since that job now but I hear you brother it's great points we're out of
