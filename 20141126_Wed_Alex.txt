[00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:07.308]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.308 --> 00:00:09.069]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:10.830]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.411]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:13.951]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:18.154]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.154 --> 00:00:24.657]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:34.783]  Absolutely no doubt now, things in Ferguson and the rest of the country are going exactly as we predicted they would, if this was indeed a shy-op.
[00:00:37.023 --> 00:00:47.791]  Again, the police, the military that are out there getting shot at and attacked are not to blame in this because they're compartmentalized just like the public.
[00:00:47.791 --> 00:01:00.900]  This is a plan to demonize the First Amendment and to legitimize the globalization, federalization of the National Stability Police Force that the RAND Corporation has been promoting.
[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.683]  And now we have a top general coming out on CNN last night
[00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:15.787]  Calling for regular army on the streets all over the United States.
[00:01:15.787 --> 00:01:31.977]  So you have the police stand down under federal control when this starts, and go after reporters instead, months ago, and then they basically stand down again, and then you have to bring in even more force.
[00:01:31.977 --> 00:01:32.978]  And you've got these
[00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:45.830]  Idiot agitators, and then you've got worse criminals, and what I've called terrorists, running around exacerbating the situation as pawns in the game.
[00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:56.058]  And one of our reporters, Sha'Carri Jackson, last night got threatened by a masked thug who says, I guess he watches and listens to the show, saying, I'll show you terrorists.
[00:01:56.058 --> 00:01:59.881]  I said, see, that's a straw man.
[00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:01.663]  We're not saying demonstrators are terrorists.
[00:02:03.012 --> 00:02:14.582]  We're saying people shooting at firefighters, trying to put houses and churches out, like Mr. Brown's church that got burned down.
[00:02:14.582 --> 00:02:28.093]  When you, for pure fear and intimidation, shoot at people, two FBI agents have been shot, two cops have been shot, an innocent man was killed in his car, burned out a bunch of stuff.
[00:02:29.676 --> 00:02:35.302]  The people doing that are engaged in terrorism.
[00:02:35.302 --> 00:02:42.649]  It's a terroristic threat to come up and terrorize somebody and say, I'll show you and menace them.
[00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:52.239]  Now, I'm the one that basically from day one began fighting the police state and fighting the globalization, the tyranny, the armored vehicles,
[00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.992]  But there's another end to that game.
[00:02:56.992 --> 00:03:04.478]  We can't be played off against the police into a civil war.
[00:03:04.478 --> 00:03:08.741]  And I just don't know if people are smart enough or sophisticated enough to understand this.
[00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:15.647]  To me, this is incredibly simple.
[00:03:15.647 --> 00:03:20.210]  If the American people can be played off against the police, the globalists win.
[00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.791]  And a lot of citizens are going to die.
[00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:23.773]  And a lot of police are going to die.
[00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:38.823]  And then when they're done setting up a national police force, it's already in place, but rolling it out, they're going to flip it on to gun owners and veterans, the real enemy of the globalists.
[00:03:38.823 --> 00:03:41.784]  By the way, four months ago on July 17th,
[00:03:44.361 --> 00:03:44.821]  U.S.
[00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:48.104]  Army training to fight black Americans.
[00:03:48.104 --> 00:03:52.447]  Doomsday Disneyland facility uses practice ground for civil unrest.
[00:03:52.447 --> 00:04:06.938]  Paul Joseph Watson with a special video emergency report I issued saying they're preparing for race war in America and for the media to stir up incidents to cause mass rioting and the regular army
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.063]  Which, now on CNN, in fact, I had it in the stack and I can't find it.
[00:04:12.063 --> 00:04:17.387]  Reprint me the headline, uh, General Calls for Regular Army on Streets.
[00:04:17.387 --> 00:04:19.408]  Instead of trying to find it.
[00:04:19.408 --> 00:04:20.869]  Thank you.
[00:04:20.869 --> 00:04:22.791]  Is now saying that.
[00:04:22.791 --> 00:04:24.672]  So let me tell you who's to blame here.
[00:04:24.672 --> 00:04:26.574]  It's the National Security Council.
[00:04:26.574 --> 00:04:28.035]  It's the United Nations.
[00:04:28.035 --> 00:04:31.518]  It's President Obama.
[00:04:31.518 --> 00:04:33.219]  It's the people running NORTHCOM.
[00:04:35.135 --> 00:04:45.905]  Are trying to condition us to accept martial law in America, and I'm trying to stop black people being used as a scapegoat and stirred up to be the pawns in this.
[00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:53.492]  Now, if that's racist, and if not wanting blacks to abort after babies is racist, then you better believe I'm hardcore racist.
[00:04:53.492 --> 00:04:58.237]  What I am is sick of a bunch of racist black people telling me I'm racist, but I'm trying to help them.
[00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:04.672]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:05:04.672 --> 00:05:11.074]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.

[00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:33.690]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.971]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:37.971 --> 00:05:39.751]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:47.613]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:48.753]  But for how long?
[00:05:48.753 --> 00:05:55.394]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:55.394 --> 00:05:58.195]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.281]  Another major health threat.
[00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:06.263]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:06:06.263 --> 00:06:08.924]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:06:08.924 --> 00:06:15.967]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:06:15.967 --> 00:06:18.948]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:06:18.948 --> 00:06:21.910]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.931]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:26.772]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:06:26.852 --> 00:06:32.574]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:06:32.574 --> 00:06:36.075]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:06:36.075 --> 00:06:39.176]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:06:39.176 --> 00:06:46.498]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:06:59.762 --> 00:07:06.144]  When I first got online and I seen the price of X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[00:07:06.144 --> 00:07:07.224]  It has changed my life.
[00:07:07.224 --> 00:07:10.825]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now, counting the weight, staying in shape.
[00:07:10.825 --> 00:07:13.386]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:13.386 --> 00:07:14.846]  You've heard the callers of the show.
[00:07:14.846 --> 00:07:18.848]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super meal.
[00:07:18.848 --> 00:07:20.848]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[00:07:20.848 --> 00:07:23.489]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:33.333]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shields, oxy powder.
[00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:41.097]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:41.517 --> 00:07:43.280]  That's true.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.124]  Just amazing what it's able to do to actually detox the body.
[00:07:47.124 --> 00:07:47.885]  It's great stuff.
[00:07:47.885 --> 00:07:51.990]  If I'm going to promote something, it's got to be something I personally use and that I believe in.
[00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:58.739]  Check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[00:08:15.456 --> 00:08:20.440]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:27.266]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.266 --> 00:08:33.452]  Revolution in their mind, the children start to march.
[00:08:33.452 --> 00:08:35.894]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[00:08:35.894 --> 00:08:36.154]  to 2 p.m.
[00:08:36.154 --> 00:08:36.975]  Central, we're here live.
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:44.884]  Of course, we return weeknight, 7 o'clock central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:08:44.884 --> 00:08:46.185]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:46.185 --> 00:08:57.072]  We have no guest today other than Jakari Jackson and, of course, Joe Biggs, who will be landing at about 245 and should be in studio with us the last 30 minutes of the transmission.
[00:08:57.072 --> 00:09:02.195]  We went ahead and made the decision to pull him out of Ferguson because it's gotten too dangerous.
[00:09:02.195 --> 00:09:09.000]  And plus, now there's new demonstrations and riots breaking out, run by the Democratic Party all over the country.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:31.985]  I carefully last night and this morning spent hours, hours, going in, and anybody can do this, and looking at the signs and photos and videos, and they'll have the group pushing it at the bottom, all of them communist, socialist, environmental terrorist linked groups, Democratic Party, George Soros, sock puppets.
[00:09:31.985 --> 00:09:38.326]  This is their attempt, when their whole agenda of open borders and socialism and world government is collapsing,
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:45.622]  To use the tragic death of a young black man to try to create race war in this country.
[00:09:45.622 --> 00:09:49.483]  By the way, it'd be easy for me to say that now.
[00:09:49.483 --> 00:09:53.624]  And you could just say that's my opinion.
[00:09:53.624 --> 00:09:57.445]  Infowars.com.
[00:09:57.445 --> 00:09:58.025]  July.
[00:09:58.025 --> 00:10:01.366]  Let me see.
[00:10:01.366 --> 00:10:03.727]  November, October.
[00:10:03.727 --> 00:10:06.247]  How many months ago was July?
[00:10:06.247 --> 00:10:07.528]  Counting back.
[00:10:07.528 --> 00:10:08.068]  Five months ago?
[00:10:10.407 --> 00:10:11.768]  Four and a half.
[00:10:11.768 --> 00:10:13.068]  U.S.
[00:10:13.068 --> 00:10:17.970]  Army training to fight black Americans is the headline.
[00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:29.715]  Doomsday Disneyland facility used as practice ground for civil unrest by regular army and Northcom for full deployment in the U.S.
[00:10:29.715 --> 00:10:34.157]  and every single role player is as black
[00:10:36.983 --> 00:10:46.349]  Oh, they're blacker than Al Sharpton, blacker than Barack Obama, blacker than Jesse Jackson.
[00:10:46.349 --> 00:10:55.435]  And we warned you before this Ferguson situation was even on the radar screen, before the media picked it.
[00:10:55.435 --> 00:10:58.838]  There's a lot of examples of police shooting innocent black men and women.
[00:10:58.838 --> 00:11:02.540]  There are a lot of examples of them shooting Hispanics, whites, other cops.
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.842]  I mean, there's bad cops out of there out of two million police.
[00:11:06.311 --> 00:11:09.652]  Or a million and a half.
[00:11:09.652 --> 00:11:13.353]  But they picked one where the guy was a thug, the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:11:13.353 --> 00:11:16.834]  Where the cop told the truth, the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:11:16.834 --> 00:11:23.095]  So that they could make all the people that came out and protested look like fools.
[00:11:23.095 --> 00:11:27.537]  Especially when they injected a bunch of provocateurs in there.
[00:11:27.537 --> 00:11:29.017]  And had the media hype the whole thing.
[00:11:31.013 --> 00:11:34.698]  Three dead and 15 wounded in weekend shootings in Chicago alone.
[00:11:34.698 --> 00:11:36.481]  Almost every one of them black on black.
[00:11:36.481 --> 00:11:42.689]  But you're not going to see a bunch of people out there protesting and demonstrating that.
[00:11:42.689 --> 00:11:46.194]  You're not going to hear the black community that's controlled by the globalists clearly.
[00:11:47.515 --> 00:11:53.378]  Saying, hey, we don't like gangster rap and all these things that are preparing our young men for prison.
[00:11:53.378 --> 00:12:09.286]  But you will hear InfoWars.com with the real Rick Ross and Professor Griff and KRS-One and countless others that actually want everybody to be successful and free in this country, not all of us being played off against each other.
[00:12:09.286 --> 00:12:12.768]  I saw a lot of comments on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:15.086 --> 00:12:19.910]  Last night and this morning, saying, how dare you Alex Jones sabbath the police?
[00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:23.053]  How dare you, you know, not support the demonstrators?
[00:12:23.053 --> 00:12:25.495]  Let me explain something.
[00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:31.521]  Not because I care about criticism, but so you can get it straight in your mind and not be ignorant and not be fooled anymore.
[00:12:31.521 --> 00:12:34.203]  Because I'm all about exposing the rabbit trick.
[00:12:34.203 --> 00:12:36.445]  I'm all about exposing how this thing works.
[00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:41.170]  That's how we're going to be free is discovering the scams and the frauds and not being a bunch of chumps.
[00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:46.441]  All I've called for is not having a civil war.
[00:12:46.441 --> 00:12:48.723]  All I've called for is not having a race war.
[00:12:48.723 --> 00:12:50.804]  I predicted all of this.
[00:12:50.804 --> 00:12:52.345]  They're trying to do this.
[00:12:52.345 --> 00:12:57.248]  You could watch MSNBC every night and see the race baiting and see what they were doing.
[00:12:57.248 --> 00:12:59.850]  It's as clear as the nose on my face or your face.
[00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:15.777]  I am sick of when I'm against turning my guns in and being called a racist, or I don't support Obamacare because it has death panels and increases everybody's rates and taxes poor people.
[00:13:15.777 --> 00:13:17.799]  I'm called a racist.
[00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:22.763]  And when I don't support people out there, quote, demonstrating because they're burning and shooting people,
[00:13:24.534 --> 00:13:25.935]  Then I'm a racist again.
[00:13:25.935 --> 00:13:27.456]  Let me explain something.
[00:13:27.456 --> 00:13:35.962]  When people accuse me of that, I don't care because I love you and want you to be successful and want you to win.
[00:13:35.962 --> 00:13:40.945]  And don't want fluoride in your water to brain damage you and lower your IQ.
[00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:43.547]  And don't want you drinking high fructose corn syrup.
[00:13:43.547 --> 00:13:49.030]  And don't want your kids eating GMO that kills the honeybees that eat it.
[00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.472]  And I don't care what color you are.
[00:13:51.472 --> 00:13:54.214]  I don't think in those terms as a default.
[00:14:00.438 --> 00:14:02.239]  The Trayvon Martin thing had been going on.
[00:14:02.239 --> 00:14:10.501]  I'm going to get into all the latest news on Ferguson, but the way this affects Infowars and myself is a microcosm of everything else, so I'm going to get into it right now.
[00:14:10.501 --> 00:14:14.763]  Trayvon Martin verdict had just come out.
[00:14:14.763 --> 00:14:17.744]  We have a huge black audience that listens to the show.
[00:14:17.744 --> 00:14:21.705]  We have a huge audience, period, no matter what color you are.
[00:14:24.201 --> 00:14:38.129]  And I had said the whole thing was a shy op, a setup with the Justice Department, and that clearly Zimmerman was an idiot, and he's been proven to be an idiot now, but that he was getting his head slammed in the ground, according to multiple witnesses, two of them black, and he feared for his life, so he shot Trayvon Martin.
[00:14:38.129 --> 00:14:39.289]  Was that a good thing?
[00:14:39.289 --> 00:14:46.854]  No, but you can get no billed by a grand jury, or you can get found not guilty by a jury, when there's those circumstances.
[00:14:46.854 --> 00:14:48.795]  It means there's reasonable doubt.
[00:14:48.795 --> 00:14:51.076]  And suddenly, I had a lot of my black listeners mad at me.
[00:14:51.076 --> 00:14:51.556]  I don't care.
[00:14:51.556 --> 00:14:52.837]  I know I've got integrity.
[00:14:54.246 --> 00:14:56.587]  And so, believe whatever you want.
[00:14:56.587 --> 00:15:10.672]  And so, that black lady, I forget her name, poor lady with her kid in the back, was driving around D.C., runs to an army checkpoint during a drill, they tell her, pull over, she gets scared, like any normal person, drives off, and they shoot her dead!
[00:15:10.672 --> 00:15:14.294]  Black and white cops shoot her dead.
[00:15:14.294 --> 00:15:22.417]  And in the hour that chase was going on, we didn't know what color she was, and the hours it took for the news to come out, I said, this is horrible that they killed this woman.
[00:15:23.735 --> 00:15:28.919]  And I saw comments all over YouTube and InfoWars going, how dare you, you racist piece of garbage.
[00:15:28.919 --> 00:15:30.881]  You only care because it's a white woman.
[00:15:30.881 --> 00:15:32.643]  Her race wasn't known.
[00:15:32.643 --> 00:15:37.567]  I didn't think what colors this woman that just got executed by the police.
[00:15:37.567 --> 00:15:40.669]  Like they're Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin or something.
[00:15:40.669 --> 00:15:41.210]  East Berlin.
[00:15:42.935 --> 00:15:45.977]  I just thought I saw a woman being chased in a car.
[00:15:45.977 --> 00:15:47.318]  We didn't know what color she was.
[00:15:47.318 --> 00:15:48.958]  All we could see is she had dark hair.
[00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.259]  I was against her being killed.
[00:15:50.259 --> 00:15:57.403]  And suddenly there was all this outpouring, we apologize, you care, you're not racist, you're mad they killed a black lady.
[00:15:57.403 --> 00:16:03.206]  Well of course I'm mad they killed an innocent black woman.
[00:16:03.206 --> 00:16:10.290]  Then Congress gave a standing ovation to the DC cops that cowardly shot her when she wasn't endangering anybody.
[00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:11.091]  When they executed her.
[00:16:12.557 --> 00:16:15.540]  And Neocon Radio praised her execution.
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.922]  Michael Savage didn't.
[00:16:17.922 --> 00:16:21.425]  He's the only other talk show host that saw how sick it was.
[00:16:21.425 --> 00:16:26.409]  George Norrie didn't think it was good either, but he's not so much political.
[00:16:26.409 --> 00:16:33.516]  So see, that just shows, see I think like Martin Luther King did, where I'm not looking at what color you are first.
[00:16:34.935 --> 00:16:37.396]  I will look at how you're dressed and what you're driving, though.
[00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:39.317]  I tell you, that'll tell you a lot more.
[00:16:39.317 --> 00:16:48.980]  I walk out of some restaurant with my kids, and there's some guys that look like they're a criminal motorcycle gang, and they're bugging their eyes out at me, and revving their motorcycles, and they're all white.
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:54.422]  I immediately start getting ready if one of them tries to rob me or assault me to defend myself and my family.
[00:16:55.742 --> 00:17:04.724]  And the same thing, I see black guys dressed like thugs, acting like thugs, and kind of bowing up a little bit at me at a gas station, I'll sit there and start bowing up at them and going over to my car where I got a gun.
[00:17:04.724 --> 00:17:10.965]  And let me tell you, it ain't because they're black, it's because they look and act like thugs!
[00:17:10.965 --> 00:17:15.767]  And I don't like white thugs, and I don't like black thugs, and I don't like Mexican thugs!
[00:17:15.767 --> 00:17:17.067]  I'm sick of thugs!
[00:17:17.067 --> 00:17:21.828]  And let me tell you something else, I don't like cops in some cities I've been in that look and act like thugs either.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:36.945]  You see, you can get thugs in uniform, you can get thugs in black skin, white skin, yellow skin, brown skin, I don't care, you can get thugs in any color of the rainbow, and I don't like them.
[00:17:36.945 --> 00:17:40.187]  Tyranny is government by thugs.
[00:17:40.187 --> 00:17:46.889]  When you had that black EMT pulled over by a bunch of white officers in Oklahoma a few years ago, I was one of the first to decry it.
[00:17:46.889 --> 00:17:50.271]  Pulling over the ambulance, choking the black guy, getting in his face,
[00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:52.752]  Telling him to do something?
[00:17:52.752 --> 00:17:54.634]  I said, what a bunch of cowards!
[00:17:54.634 --> 00:17:59.440]  Need to be fired!
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.745]  I wasn't looking at what color that EMT was.
[00:18:02.745 --> 00:18:04.427]  But I think there was something racial going on there.
[00:18:05.956 --> 00:18:07.778]  Had a woman in the back having a heart attack.
[00:18:07.778 --> 00:18:09.079]  Clearly that stuff goes on.
[00:18:09.079 --> 00:18:18.246]  But you just can't mindlessly then sit there, despite what the witnesses say, and say, we're gonna kill a cop, we're gonna kill his family because he didn't get indicted.
[00:18:18.246 --> 00:18:26.032]  And then the thugs say, we're gonna riot and burn stuff, including Brown's Church and Mexican food restaurants, you name it.
[00:18:26.032 --> 00:18:31.417]  Even if they indict the cop, you can't have mob rule in this country.
[00:18:31.417 --> 00:18:32.618]  And that's what the Democratic Party
[00:18:34.651 --> 00:18:49.249]  All over the U.S., arrests in L.A., New York, just hundreds of cities, had Democratic Party events with the primers, a bunch of liberal, fake, white, socialist communists out there with their made-up signs.
[00:18:50.526 --> 00:18:57.508]  Getting it going, so it gets on the news, right in the black neighborhood, so black folks watch it and go, yeah, I'm gonna go join them!
[00:18:57.508 --> 00:19:06.130]  In every protest, it'd be 10 George Soros operatives, or Justice Department operatives, out there to sucker the black sin again.
[00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.511]  And doing it over, and over and over again.
[00:19:08.511 --> 00:19:09.471]  So that's what's going on.
[00:19:09.471 --> 00:19:12.112]  We're having to clean the tape up, there's so much profanity.
[00:19:12.112 --> 00:19:14.873]  Thugs, masked thugs coming up to Jakari.
[00:19:14.873 --> 00:19:17.494]  And looking at him with so much hate, it blew my mind.
[00:19:17.494 --> 00:19:18.514]  I said, that's it, come home.
[00:19:20.157 --> 00:19:21.639]  Sam, you sell out.
[00:19:21.639 --> 00:19:22.841]  I'll show you terrorists.
[00:19:22.841 --> 00:19:25.125]  How dare Alex Jones say we're terrorists?
[00:19:25.125 --> 00:19:31.074]  Well, if you're shooting at unarmed firefighters, trying to put fires out, they could kill people.
[00:19:31.074 --> 00:19:31.896]  You are a terrorist.
[00:19:33.425 --> 00:19:34.646]  That is what terrorism is.
[00:19:34.646 --> 00:19:36.267]  Trying to terrorize people.
[00:19:36.267 --> 00:19:38.509]  Trying to shoot unarmed public servants.
[00:19:38.509 --> 00:19:39.790]  That's terrorism.
[00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:41.271]  And what the government did at Waco.
[00:19:41.271 --> 00:19:42.692]  Opening fire on that church.
[00:19:42.692 --> 00:19:44.073]  That was terrorism.
[00:19:44.073 --> 00:19:45.354]  I don't care if you're black.
[00:19:45.354 --> 00:19:46.875]  I don't care if you're the FBI.
[00:19:46.875 --> 00:19:49.457]  I don't care who you are when you act like a terrorist.
[00:19:49.457 --> 00:19:51.299]  I don't care if you got a uniform or not.
[00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:52.820]  But that's what this is all about.
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.861]  Skin color is now a uniform.
[00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:56.563]  And the globalists are manipulating us.
[00:19:56.563 --> 00:19:58.564]  I'm gonna break down all the latest straight ahead.

[00:20:35.726 --> 00:20:38.507]  10 seconds is not enough time to protect your family.

[00:21:30.217 --> 00:21:31.218]  Hey, Boomer!
[00:21:31.218 --> 00:21:34.660]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.321]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[00:21:36.321 --> 00:21:38.282]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[00:21:38.282 --> 00:21:43.785]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[00:21:43.785 --> 00:21:44.945]  I know, right?
[00:21:44.945 --> 00:21:46.266]  You love it, too!
[00:21:46.266 --> 00:21:47.707]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[00:21:47.707 --> 00:21:48.727]  Let's go get some.

[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:05.507]  If you have Candida overgrowth, just taking antifungal agents or starving yourself of sweets does not address the cause.
[00:22:05.507 --> 00:22:11.274]  Candida overgrowth is the result of a toxic, damaged, acidic, low oxygen, and inflamed tissue environment.
[00:22:11.274 --> 00:22:18.242]  The goal should be to remove the toxins, heal damaged tissues, restore healthy pH, eliminate inflammation, and feed beneficial bacteria.
[00:22:18.462 --> 00:22:27.707]  Previous usage of antibiotics or steroids or exposure to mercury or other toxins can damage many cells in the GI tract and body that make you prone to Candida overgrowth.
[00:22:27.707 --> 00:22:30.728]  Removing toxins and healing tissues should be the goal.

[00:23:06.847 --> 00:23:10.429]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:23:10.429 --> 00:23:16.532]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:23:16.832 --> 00:23:19.354]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[00:23:46.534 --> 00:23:51.297]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[00:23:51.297 --> 00:24:06.967]  MyPatriotSupply.com MyPatriotSupply.com You can run on for a long time.
[00:24:06.967 --> 00:24:07.468]  Run on.
[00:24:14.437 --> 00:24:18.239]  So, protesters flood streets across the U.S.
[00:24:18.239 --> 00:24:22.661]  as Ferguson dismay spreads coast to coast.
[00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:30.845]  That is government globalist run CNN on record CIA Department of Defense running it.
[00:24:30.845 --> 00:24:31.325]  Look it up.
[00:24:31.325 --> 00:24:34.587]  Just type in CNN run by secret Pentagon team.
[00:24:34.587 --> 00:24:37.088]  You'll get Washington Post.
[00:24:37.088 --> 00:24:38.429]  I mean, I'm not just saying that.
[00:24:39.616 --> 00:24:41.799]  Remember Gore Vidal, before he died, went on CNN once.
[00:24:41.799 --> 00:24:43.040]  He said, this is amazing.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:53.353]  This is the first time I've been on CNN in years where there wasn't an army general standing behind them telling the person I'm debating during the breaks what to say.
[00:24:53.353 --> 00:24:54.214]  Because that goes on.
[00:24:55.919 --> 00:25:02.382]  Well, now they've just moved on to PSYOP, the NFL, and ESPN because there's no audience for the news.
[00:25:02.382 --> 00:25:04.623]  The larger job was to discredit U.S.
[00:25:04.623 --> 00:25:09.985]  journalism by infiltrating it and turning it into state-run to destroy it.
[00:25:09.985 --> 00:25:14.907]  They're scared of big institutions with investigative journalists.
[00:25:14.907 --> 00:25:17.428]  Now they're moving into the Internet to kill it as well.
[00:25:18.823 --> 00:25:23.045]  Now again, our military is the hope but also the doom.
[00:25:23.045 --> 00:25:24.066]  It's up to us.
[00:25:24.066 --> 00:25:28.748]  The military is very awake because they're now aware of the PSYOP.
[00:25:28.748 --> 00:25:31.270]  They've been decompartmentalized.
[00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.171]  Same thing with the police in many cases.
[00:25:33.171 --> 00:25:35.352]  That's why we don't want to make them our enemy.
[00:25:35.352 --> 00:25:36.212]  It's pointless.
[00:25:36.212 --> 00:25:37.513]  They're Americans too.
[00:25:37.513 --> 00:25:40.635]  We have to say, no, we're aware of the Rand Corporation plan.
[00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:44.279]  We're aware of the National Stability Force.
[00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:49.864]  We're aware of the fascist takeover program to use socialism as a control system.
[00:25:49.864 --> 00:25:51.105]  Then it's game over.
[00:25:51.105 --> 00:26:00.194]  So you've got CNN and MSNBC and everybody fanning the flames of this over a guy strong-arming a convenience store minutes before he shot.
[00:26:00.194 --> 00:26:04.498]  Witnesses saying he attacked a cop, ran back, charged him again.
[00:26:04.498 --> 00:26:05.459]  Is it excessive force?
[00:26:06.616 --> 00:26:13.559]  I mean, I've gotten to the point, 40 years old, I can fight pretty good, but, you know, if somebody attacks me in a parking lot, I'm just gonna, starts attacking me.
[00:26:13.559 --> 00:26:15.360]  I'm gonna try to get in my car and get away from them.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.322]  If they start knocking on the window, I'm just gonna shoot them.
[00:26:18.322 --> 00:26:23.144]  I don't have to sit there and roll over and die.
[00:26:23.144 --> 00:26:27.967]  And, you know, if a black guy's being attacked by a white guy for no reason, shoot him!
[00:26:27.967 --> 00:26:30.308]  I mean, it's real simple.
[00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:43.077]  So, now we have the grand jury documents, and the witnesses are telling the grand jury, black witnesses are telling them, that, you know, Brown attacked the cop, basically.
[00:26:43.077 --> 00:26:43.478]  Who knows?
[00:26:43.478 --> 00:26:44.318]  That might not be true.
[00:26:44.318 --> 00:26:47.560]  The point is, why is this the big hype?
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.883]  Because the country's being sucked dry by foreign banks.
[00:26:50.883 --> 00:27:01.170]  The country is being taken over by the globalists, and they want us fighting with each other while they open the borders, while they raise the taxes, while Obamacare goes through, while the UN gun treaty goes in.
[00:27:02.498 --> 00:27:05.059]  Let me tell you, the riots get bad enough, they're trying to start.
[00:27:05.059 --> 00:27:06.299]  It's like a fire, though.
[00:27:06.299 --> 00:27:17.104]  They've just got small flames going right now in the aggregate, historically, compared to the riots, the Watts riots, and things of the 60s, and things like that, and the 92 riot.
[00:27:17.104 --> 00:27:21.165]  But they could really go whole hog here, and it could really explode.
[00:27:21.165 --> 00:27:22.846]  Remember what Henry Kissinger said at Bilderberg in 2001?
[00:27:22.846 --> 00:27:24.746]  Or was it 1991, going from memory?
[00:27:24.746 --> 00:27:25.847]  He said, hey,
[00:27:30.154 --> 00:27:39.029]  Americans would never accept UN peacekeepers in Los Angeles unless there was a big enough crisis and then they would beg for their global government to come and occupy them.
[00:27:42.515 --> 00:28:06.869]  So remember, we told you this was coming, and that Obama's endgame, his last two years in office, would be to invoke racial division and racial animus to bring in the police state, to legitimize military equipment to the police, while at the same time getting the Democratic Party more into a racial-based system to not even care if black unemployment doubles under Obama.
[00:28:06.869 --> 00:28:08.750]  At least they can go out and hate white people.
[00:28:09.718 --> 00:28:12.961]  Because the poor white person living down the street, they did it.
[00:28:12.961 --> 00:28:24.151]  Or the poor white woman who's a manager at Papa John's, probably getting $12 an hour, came out with her bare hands, we have video of that, and fought off men with her bare hands.
[00:28:24.151 --> 00:28:31.557]  Why didn't the managers give her a gun if she's gonna stay there and defend the Papa John's?
[00:28:31.557 --> 00:28:36.802]  I mean, you gotta love this country where it's women fighting thugs off.
[00:28:38.561 --> 00:28:44.643]  While the police stand down.
[00:28:44.643 --> 00:28:49.825]  I mean, it is just simply ridiculous that we've turned into this.
[00:28:49.825 --> 00:28:51.406]  As the police stand down.
[00:28:51.406 --> 00:29:03.190]  Yeah, I mean, there's the black guys yelling at the poor white woman, getting in her face, as if a woman getting $12 an hour at Papa John's is exploiting the black community in their making pizzas.
[00:29:05.964 --> 00:29:10.005]  And he starts kicking the window in, hits the woman, and then she pushes him back.
[00:29:10.005 --> 00:29:11.146]  I mean, what tough guys.
[00:29:11.146 --> 00:29:14.387]  Let me tell you what my daughters or family would do.
[00:29:14.387 --> 00:29:18.168]  Pull a revolver out, shove it in your chest, and start pulling the trigger.
[00:29:18.168 --> 00:29:20.809]  That's called real feminine empowerment.
[00:29:20.809 --> 00:29:24.170]  The women in my family, you assault them, they don't fist fight you.
[00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:26.591]  They pull a gun out, they pump it into you.
[00:29:26.591 --> 00:29:31.732]  And then everybody can cry and go, oh my gosh, she didn't let the thugs attack her.
[00:29:31.732 --> 00:29:32.533]  She's racist.
[00:29:32.533 --> 00:29:32.573]  No.
[00:29:34.124 --> 00:29:35.405]  People are sick of it.
[00:29:35.405 --> 00:29:39.608]  Just because you're white doesn't mean you deserve to have your head caved in like Reginald Denny.
[00:29:39.608 --> 00:29:43.050]  Or if you're black, you don't deserve to have the Klan drag you behind a car.
[00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:44.331]  It's the same thing!
[00:29:44.331 --> 00:29:46.393]  I'm sick of it!
[00:29:46.393 --> 00:29:47.173]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:47.173 --> 00:29:49.415]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.415 --> 00:29:50.836]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.836 --> 00:29:53.358]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.358 --> 00:29:56.020]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:30.339 --> 00:31:34.001]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:31:34.001 --> 00:31:38.283]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:31:38.283 --> 00:31:40.064]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:47.908]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:31:47.908 --> 00:31:49.049]  But for how long?

[00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:01.350]  The experts are clear.

[00:32:08.457 --> 00:32:14.743]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[00:32:14.743 --> 00:32:18.327]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.

[00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:27.992]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:32:27.992 --> 00:32:28.992]  Not our iodine.
[00:32:28.992 --> 00:32:32.814]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:32:32.814 --> 00:32:35.355]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:33:17.918 --> 00:33:26.785]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:26.785 --> 00:33:31.509]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:42.138]  If I see two white men on a video slapping around and trying to beat up a black woman, I get mad and hate them.
[00:33:42.138 --> 00:33:47.041]  And if I see two black men beating up a white woman for no reason and trying to assault her,
[00:33:47.847 --> 00:33:52.451]  I'm trying to break the window in her business.
[00:33:52.451 --> 00:33:53.893]  I get upset.
[00:33:53.893 --> 00:34:02.301]  If I see two black men beating up a black woman or two white men beating up a white woman, I get just as equally as angry because I'm not an idiot.
[00:34:02.301 --> 00:34:08.486]  I operate off of what people stand for and what they create and what they do.
[00:34:08.486 --> 00:34:11.930]  If I see a painting that I like, I don't care if you're black or white if you painted it.
[00:34:13.328 --> 00:34:16.071]  If I see a sculpture, I don't care what color you are.
[00:34:16.071 --> 00:34:17.473]  If I like it, I like it.
[00:34:17.473 --> 00:34:21.897]  I don't care what color you are, if you're a jazz singer or a jazz musician.
[00:34:21.897 --> 00:34:26.462]  I mean, I love Jimi Hendrix songs.
[00:34:26.462 --> 00:34:29.946]  Not because he's black, but because it touches me.
[00:34:29.946 --> 00:34:36.353]  And I will not sit up here with a bunch of dumbed-down thugs who think
[00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:43.323]  attacking their local community churches and setting them on fire, send some message telling me I'm racist.
[00:34:43.323 --> 00:34:49.247]  You're the people that are racist, that are doing that, and you give demonstrators a bad name.
[00:34:49.247 --> 00:35:05.499]  But the larger issue is the controlled globalist operation that's robbing us all blind, that wants to roll out a paramilitary force in America, that they told us was for Al-Qaeda 14 years ago, but that I told you
[00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:15.456]  Over and over and over again was for the American people across the board.
[00:35:15.456 --> 00:35:17.397]  But they'll always pick some group.
[00:35:17.397 --> 00:35:22.220]  Oh, it's black people, so we've got to have a police state for them.
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:29.225]  Playing off underlying prejudice and racism, but also stereotypes that are being played out.
[00:35:29.225 --> 00:35:32.787]  Being played like a fiddle.
[00:35:32.787 --> 00:35:34.028]  But then the real target
[00:35:34.864 --> 00:35:43.570]  In all the Homeland Security training and all the real preparation is gun owners, rural communities, self-sufficient people.
[00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:51.835]  Just like the control system didn't want Native Americans to be self-sufficient and put on reservations, blacks have been put on reservations, modern plantations.
[00:35:51.835 --> 00:35:54.837]  They want everybody under that model.
[00:35:54.837 --> 00:35:58.140]  It's called Agenda 21 and it affects everyone.
[00:35:58.942 --> 00:36:07.748]  And it takes all the old systems of control and brings them up to the 21st century standards of sophistication.
[00:36:07.748 --> 00:36:09.850]  So, there's no debating.
[00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:10.971]  I'm right.
[00:36:10.971 --> 00:36:12.172]  There's no debating.
[00:36:12.172 --> 00:36:14.813]  We predicted this in spades.
[00:36:14.813 --> 00:36:20.778]  There's no debating that everyone's being played off against each other like chumps.
[00:36:22.233 --> 00:36:24.294]  And there's no debating what the next phase will be.
[00:36:24.294 --> 00:36:26.856]  Remember our articles and special report videos?
[00:36:26.856 --> 00:36:30.038]  We ought to go pull the special reports I did on the nightly news.
[00:36:30.038 --> 00:36:31.499]  It's right here in the article.
[00:36:31.499 --> 00:36:31.979]  U.S.
[00:36:31.979 --> 00:36:35.182]  Army training to fight black Americans.
[00:36:35.182 --> 00:36:40.305]  Doomsday Disneyland facility used as practice ground for civil unrest.
[00:36:40.305 --> 00:36:42.727]  We ought to flashback this article.
[00:36:42.727 --> 00:36:45.789]  Top of Infowars with the video I did on the nightly news.
[00:36:45.789 --> 00:36:47.590]  A special report.
[00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.091]  I aired it the next day on the radio.
[00:36:50.387 --> 00:36:59.797]  To 5 million listeners a day, saying this was coming and that after the elections, it's on the video, it's in the article, go watch it.
[00:36:59.797 --> 00:37:00.698]  I'll play it next hour.
[00:37:00.698 --> 00:37:03.400]  About an 8 minute report.
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:09.006]  I told you exactly what would happen.
[00:37:09.006 --> 00:37:12.590]  And it's not because I have a crystal ball.
[00:37:14.116 --> 00:37:19.612]  It's because I am outside the box watching the Globalist prepare for 22 years.
[00:37:19.612 --> 00:37:20.314]  On air for 20.
[00:37:23.303 --> 00:37:28.366]  I've had the special forces jump out of the woods and set fires and try to blame them on me.
[00:37:28.366 --> 00:37:31.027]  I've been attacked physically and told to shut up.
[00:37:31.027 --> 00:37:36.070]  I've gotten the phone calls where nothing shows up on caller ID and they tell you what you just did five minutes before.
[00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:37.250]  I've lived it.
[00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:39.151]  I know what's going on.
[00:37:39.151 --> 00:37:40.952]  I know about the FEMA camps.
[00:37:40.952 --> 00:37:42.693]  I know about where they are.
[00:37:42.693 --> 00:37:44.814]  I've given you the names where you can look them up.
[00:37:44.814 --> 00:37:46.875]  The Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[00:37:46.875 --> 00:37:48.756]  The Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[00:37:48.756 --> 00:37:49.957]  They're not called FEMA camps.
[00:37:50.737 --> 00:37:52.458]  Chemtrails aren't called chemtrails.
[00:37:52.458 --> 00:37:55.499]  They're called geoengineering programs.
[00:37:55.499 --> 00:37:58.900]  They play lawyer games with all of you.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:07.043]  And I want all of you to be free because my children are going to live on this planet with your children.
[00:38:07.043 --> 00:38:10.344]  And if I screw somebody over, it comes back on me.
[00:38:10.344 --> 00:38:13.665]  I don't want 52% of black people to never be born.
[00:38:14.872 --> 00:38:16.413]  To be butchered.
[00:38:16.413 --> 00:38:23.920]  I don't want all the Hispanic girls in Latin America being injected with Gardasil to basically sterilize them.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:30.386]  Even though blacks and Latin Americans are being prepared as the enemy for race war against gringos.
[00:38:30.386 --> 00:38:32.188]  I still can't give up my humanity.
[00:38:32.188 --> 00:38:33.649]  I see the brainwashing.
[00:38:33.649 --> 00:38:35.330]  I see the mind control.
[00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:39.935]  I see us all being turned into biological programmable robots.
[00:38:39.935 --> 00:38:41.176]  I see whites fearful
[00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:53.396]  Going with the power structure and the police state out of necessity and fear because they've been wrongfully demonized.
[00:38:53.396 --> 00:38:56.598]  Less than 2% of Americans in the South own slaves.
[00:38:56.598 --> 00:38:59.159]  Smithsonian Institute, look it up.
[00:38:59.159 --> 00:39:06.022]  Most Americans who are white immigrated here, their grandparents or great-grandparents, after slavery.
[00:39:06.022 --> 00:39:08.084]  Ireland never had slavery.
[00:39:08.084 --> 00:39:10.545]  Irish were slaves in this country and in Ireland.
[00:39:11.877 --> 00:39:14.558]  No one even knows about the million Irish slaves in this country.
[00:39:14.558 --> 00:39:18.779]  Are we going to have reparations for them?
[00:39:18.779 --> 00:39:22.840]  See how stupid this is?
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:27.302]  You know, I'm Irish, part Irish, on two sides of my dad's family.
[00:39:27.302 --> 00:39:28.842]  I'm proud of my Irish roots.
[00:39:28.842 --> 00:39:40.366]  I don't have some inferiority complex because ancestors of mine came over here as sharecroppers, indentured Irish slaves.
[00:39:45.595 --> 00:39:52.959]  That just adds to the vigor of my blood!
[00:39:52.959 --> 00:39:56.600]  Also, I had family that was British nobility, famous people.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.421]  I'm not gonna get into all that.
[00:39:58.421 --> 00:40:02.523]  The point is, is that I'm proud of my Native American ancestry.
[00:40:02.523 --> 00:40:13.429]  I am a human, first and foremost, and what I stand for is justice, ladies and gentlemen, and it makes me want to throw up to see the dumbed-down racist thugs out there
[00:40:15.333 --> 00:40:17.393]  Basically black Klansmen in my view.
[00:40:17.393 --> 00:40:27.996]  I mean people talk about the caricatures in magazines and things of blacks making fun of them or in Nazi Germany of Jews.
[00:40:27.996 --> 00:40:40.038]  Do you have any idea about the cartoons making fun of Irish and the eugenicists in the 1870s and 80s teaching that Irish were mentally retarded and stupid?
[00:40:40.038 --> 00:40:43.759]  But I mean you don't see the Irish running around today feeling sorry for themselves.
[00:40:45.097 --> 00:40:48.720]  The system even tried to implant them with an inferiority complex.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:56.345]  It didn't work, folks.
[00:40:56.345 --> 00:40:57.186]  It didn't work.
[00:41:02.523 --> 00:41:04.704]  And that's all this is, is a mind game.
[00:41:04.704 --> 00:41:12.430]  People going to the White House, run by the Soros groups, Soros-connected groups, we talked about it yesterday, on their signs, to go demand Obama do something.
[00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:13.370]  Federalize!
[00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:14.391]  Cut off the states!
[00:41:14.391 --> 00:41:16.592]  Indict cops!
[00:41:16.592 --> 00:41:18.574]  Supersede the grand jury and jury!
[00:41:18.574 --> 00:41:20.115]  Bring us a dictatorship!
[00:41:20.115 --> 00:41:20.895]  Open the borders!
[00:41:20.895 --> 00:41:21.856]  Give us Obamacare!
[00:41:23.151 --> 00:41:24.851]  Take the guns executively.
[00:41:24.851 --> 00:41:26.552]  That's what they're being taught.
[00:41:26.552 --> 00:41:30.112]  That Obama could have delivered you all this free stuff, but he's not a dictator yet.
[00:41:30.112 --> 00:41:38.874]  And now they've got the Democratic Party operatives all over the country trying to stir up riots all over the nation.
[00:41:38.874 --> 00:41:46.815]  And when they're done, if they're successful, they'll ban all assembly and all free speech so they can bring in the real tyranny.
[00:41:46.815 --> 00:41:51.776]  They will associate free speech and assembly with people shooting at firefighters and police.
[00:41:53.547 --> 00:41:58.889]  Did you hear me tear into the police when they shot our reporters and citizens with rubber bullets for no reason?
[00:41:58.889 --> 00:42:00.569]  Yes, because it was wrong.
[00:42:00.569 --> 00:42:01.709]  See, I don't take sides.
[00:42:01.709 --> 00:42:04.830]  I go with what's obviously common sense.
[00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:17.294]  But let me tell you, shooting people with rubber bullets is a far cry from shooting police and FBI and firefighters shooting up their vehicles.
[00:42:21.883 --> 00:42:25.724]  So that you can create terror and fear?
[00:42:25.724 --> 00:42:27.945]  Now shifting gears out of that, U.S.
[00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:34.766]  Army training to fight black Americans, July, five and a half months ago, four and a half months ago.
[00:42:34.766 --> 00:42:40.528]  Doomsday Disneyland facility used as practice ground for civil unrest.
[00:42:40.528 --> 00:42:42.328]  Local police training with U.S.
[00:42:42.328 --> 00:42:45.849]  National Guard troops, regular army, you name it.
[00:42:47.645 --> 00:42:50.288]  In fact, Watson, and I don't blame him, he's in England, said U.S.
[00:42:50.288 --> 00:42:51.148]  National Guard.
[00:42:51.148 --> 00:42:53.571]  They do train, but the video's Big Army.
[00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:55.012]  It's regular Army.
[00:42:55.012 --> 00:42:56.293]  You can see the patches.
[00:42:56.293 --> 00:42:58.415]  You can see the insignia on the trucks.
[00:42:58.415 --> 00:42:59.517]  Joe Begg's confirmed it.
[00:42:59.517 --> 00:43:01.098]  It's Big Army.
[00:43:01.098 --> 00:43:03.681]  We should probably add that to this article.
[00:43:03.681 --> 00:43:10.087]  And he goes over the entire plan and the admissions for domestic resistance, close quote.
[00:43:10.087 --> 00:43:10.427]  U.S.
[00:43:10.427 --> 00:43:11.949]  Army War College preparation.
[00:43:13.337 --> 00:43:14.898]  for insurrection.
[00:43:14.898 --> 00:43:17.960]  Now, what did retired general calls for U.S.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.701]  Army on streets to restore civil order?
[00:43:19.701 --> 00:43:29.587]  See, what I'm saying to the folks that are listening in Ferguson, some of them they're mad at us, you're being discredited by people throwing bricks and shooting guns.
[00:43:29.587 --> 00:43:31.528]  I'm being discredited in my First Amendment.
[00:43:31.528 --> 00:43:33.809]  I'm not going to be psyoped.
[00:43:33.809 --> 00:43:37.291]  I'm not going to not see the plan and fall for it.
[00:43:37.291 --> 00:43:39.513]  I'm not going to be chumped or gamed
[00:43:40.515 --> 00:43:41.795]  Or schmucked.
[00:43:41.795 --> 00:43:42.616]  Or conned.
[00:43:42.616 --> 00:43:43.576]  I'm not a mark.
[00:43:43.576 --> 00:43:44.676]  I'm not here to fail.
[00:43:44.676 --> 00:43:46.337]  I'm not here to be a joke.
[00:43:46.337 --> 00:43:47.597]  I'm not here to be mindless.
[00:43:47.597 --> 00:43:48.657]  I'm not here to be lazy.
[00:43:48.657 --> 00:43:49.838]  I'm not here to be stupid.
[00:43:49.838 --> 00:43:54.279]  I'm here to try to warn people about the program.
[00:43:54.279 --> 00:43:55.760]  CNN.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.260]  InfoWars.com has the video.
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:00.621]  Retired general calls for US Army on the streets to restore civil order.
[00:44:00.621 --> 00:44:06.843]  This is the same general that ran gun confiscations in the high and dry areas, Russell L. Honore.
[00:44:07.847 --> 00:44:17.834]  Commander of Joint Task Force Katrina, across the Gulf Coast, that engage in total criminal action, he now says, put troops, regular troops, on the ground.
[00:44:17.834 --> 00:44:21.837]  That's why they didn't pounce on the few people shooting and burning.
[00:44:21.837 --> 00:44:23.939]  You could have cops on every street corner.
[00:44:23.939 --> 00:44:26.961]  Somebody pulls a gun out, starts to aim it, you shoot them.
[00:44:26.961 --> 00:44:33.086]  Kill a couple of the terrorists, people trying to terrorize, shooting at firefighters, that's terrorism, that's it.
[00:44:33.086 --> 00:44:34.106]  And they'll all disappear.
[00:44:35.273 --> 00:44:39.617]  Then peaceful demonstrators won't be able to have their First Amendment.
[00:44:39.617 --> 00:44:41.919]  Didn't do that.
[00:44:41.919 --> 00:44:46.062]  You shoot two or three people setting fires.
[00:44:46.062 --> 00:44:47.763]  Oh, well, the police are intimidated by the response.
[00:44:47.763 --> 00:44:49.725]  No, they're not.
[00:44:49.725 --> 00:44:50.606]  I'll say something else.
[00:44:50.606 --> 00:44:59.813]  On average, even if police departments are corrupt, they don't want to shoot somebody in the middle of the street just for fun, knowing the paperwork, the backlash, the lawsuits.
[00:44:59.813 --> 00:45:04.137]  You can hardly get cops to do their job nowadays because they're so worried about lawsuits.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:15.188]  You think all day they just want to go around dealing with domestic disturbances and pit bulls and crack houses and just white trash meth labs and all the rest of it?
[00:45:15.188 --> 00:45:19.712]  I mean, you really think the cops are running around wanting to shoot black people on average?
[00:45:19.712 --> 00:45:22.574]  No, they're not.
[00:45:22.574 --> 00:45:27.498]  No, they're not.
[00:45:27.498 --> 00:45:30.100]  They're wanting to go to the topless bar and try to pick a girl up.
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:30.821]  I'll guarantee you.
[00:45:32.506 --> 00:45:35.347]  I mean, it is just so frustrating.
[00:45:35.347 --> 00:45:37.528]  Are they getting money on the side, or some of them dealing drugs?
[00:45:37.528 --> 00:45:38.349]  You bet.
[00:45:38.349 --> 00:45:42.171]  Are they pulling people over, writing tickets all day, and doing some illegal asset forfeiture seizure?
[00:45:42.171 --> 00:45:43.371]  You bet.
[00:45:43.371 --> 00:45:49.034]  We'll talk about that all day, but I'm not just going to be maneuvered into a civil war with police in general.
[00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:51.590]  Because the U.N.
[00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:58.513]  and the globalists want that to bring in their Pentagon, RAND Corporation, National Stabilization Force.
[00:45:58.513 --> 00:46:05.955]  I have hundreds of declassified public Army War College, Navy War College, Marine Corps, War Planning School.
[00:46:05.955 --> 00:46:10.136]  It's all linked, a bunch of them are linked to this article.
[00:46:10.136 --> 00:46:14.838]  Document Army preparing to use lethal force against unarmed civilians during full-scale riots in the U.S.
[00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:16.318]  Go read the training manual.
[00:46:16.318 --> 00:46:17.938]  We actually do real research.
[00:46:17.938 --> 00:46:19.299]  We actually know what we're talking about.
[00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:25.134]  And now we have this retired general on CNN saying this is the answer.
[00:46:25.134 --> 00:46:26.775]  They're going to let this get out of hand.
[00:46:26.775 --> 00:46:32.078]  The Democratic Party operatives are stirring it up on every front.
[00:46:32.078 --> 00:46:35.020]  You think the globalist care of a bunch of cops and citizens get killed?
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:35.741]  They love it.
[00:46:36.926 --> 00:46:40.491]  What have I fought for at least a decade since I figured this out?
[00:46:40.491 --> 00:46:42.634]  They want to stage a civil war in this country.
[00:46:42.634 --> 00:46:44.256]  Every preparation is for it.
[00:46:44.256 --> 00:46:46.579]  Let's not be idiots.
[00:46:46.579 --> 00:46:48.241]  Let's not do it.
[00:46:48.241 --> 00:46:49.983]  Let's not be part of it.
[00:46:49.983 --> 00:46:51.505]  Let's not be morons.
[00:46:53.089 --> 00:47:03.135]  I mean, my gosh, the last two weeks I've been doing specials on CIA drug dealing in the black areas to destabilize them, fighting to help these communities because it's a cancer point they're trying to spread.
[00:47:03.135 --> 00:47:10.660]  It's not just that I care, it also is self-serving to want people uplifted.
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:15.563]  Because I don't mindlessly support a bunch of thugs.
[00:47:15.563 --> 00:47:17.684]  Is the Jakari video ready yet, have we bleeped all the cussing yet?
[00:47:18.985 --> 00:47:19.726]  We're pulling it in right now.
[00:47:19.726 --> 00:47:21.407]  We'll have it in the next segment.
[00:47:21.407 --> 00:47:25.070]  It's unedited on InfoWars.com, but I can't hear all these cuss words.
[00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:26.591]  Man, I tell you, this is why I can't go to these events.
[00:47:26.591 --> 00:47:31.275]  Somebody comes up and starts, you know, threatening me, and you better watch it, and I'll show you, and all this.
[00:47:31.275 --> 00:47:35.539]  Jokari did a great job being restrained, and so did Joe Biggs.
[00:47:35.539 --> 00:47:43.005]  Besides, why would you threaten Jokari and bow up to him when I'm the one that said it's terrorist to shoot at firefighters?
[00:47:44.773 --> 00:47:45.473]  To create fear.
[00:47:45.473 --> 00:47:47.354]  That's the definition of terrorism.
[00:47:47.354 --> 00:47:53.657]  Is to threaten violence or carry out violence for a political or financial aim.
[00:47:53.657 --> 00:47:55.178]  Don't come play basketball.
[00:47:55.178 --> 00:47:57.259]  These basketball courts are, I'll kill you.
[00:47:57.259 --> 00:47:59.180]  That's terrorism.
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:47:59.940]  That's fear.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:04.803]  That's how the mafia operates.
[00:48:04.803 --> 00:48:08.645]  Let's go ahead now and go to this clip of the general.
[00:48:08.645 --> 00:48:10.366]  In fact, there's the actual definition.
[00:48:10.366 --> 00:48:13.027]  The use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims.
[00:48:13.027 --> 00:48:13.227]  Boom.
[00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:20.661]  Now, let's go ahead and go to the general promoting with the CIA operative.
[00:48:20.661 --> 00:48:21.863]  By the way, that's declassified.
[00:48:22.642 --> 00:48:26.083]  He is CIA, and he's also a robber baron heir.
[00:48:26.083 --> 00:48:27.423]  Anderson Cooper, here it is.
[00:48:27.423 --> 00:48:30.164]  But I'm telling you this, Anderson, if St.
[00:48:30.164 --> 00:48:40.926]  Louis can't control this, you know what the next step is, and it's called the Insurrection Act, the same thing they did out in Los Angeles.
[00:48:40.926 --> 00:48:50.889]  Now, we're nowhere near that now, but people might want to look at that because that is a statute that's designed if local authorities cannot control and provide civil
[00:48:51.429 --> 00:48:57.332]  So you got the globalists fanning the flames, pushing this, oh my gosh, over and over again, trying to get it going.
[00:48:57.332 --> 00:49:00.314]  Trying to get the party started.
[00:49:18.188 --> 00:49:21.031]  I mean, can't everybody just see we're being chumped here?
[00:49:21.031 --> 00:49:22.392]  I told you it was all coming!
[00:49:22.392 --> 00:49:25.454]  I gave you all the documents!
[00:49:25.454 --> 00:49:28.057]  I told you they're shipping drugs in your community and gave you the proof!
[00:49:28.057 --> 00:49:35.023]  The Iran-Contra whistleblowers, the kingpins, all of it proven here!
[00:49:35.023 --> 00:49:43.230]  And the same general that confiscated the guns from white people's homes, they didn't go in the black area, they went and looted rich people's houses, the government did.
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:50.502]  The police went around robbing Walmarts, remember?
[00:49:50.502 --> 00:49:51.802]  And we criticized it.
[00:49:51.802 --> 00:49:56.424]  When the police are bad, we just look at the facts and try to put the truth out.
[00:49:56.424 --> 00:50:00.805]  My job's actually pretty easy.
[00:50:00.805 --> 00:50:04.006]  I get so upset sometimes.
[00:50:04.006 --> 00:50:05.247]  Absolutely outrageous.
[00:50:05.247 --> 00:50:06.167]  Absolutely outrageous.
[00:50:06.167 --> 00:50:10.869]  When we come back, we've got the clip of a thug confronting Jakari Jackson.
[00:50:13.066 --> 00:50:15.327]  And bringing up our broadcast here.
[00:50:15.327 --> 00:50:16.127]  Rand Paul.
[00:50:16.127 --> 00:50:17.928]  Politicians are to blame for Ferguson.
[00:50:17.928 --> 00:50:19.789]  War on drugs creates culture of violence.
[00:50:19.789 --> 00:50:21.890]  Paul says yes.
[00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:27.312]  And then CIA funding thug life gangster hip-hop.
[00:50:27.312 --> 00:50:31.794]  Which turns people into absolute criminal scum.
[00:50:31.794 --> 00:50:33.674]  Burn this bleeper down.
[00:50:33.674 --> 00:50:35.955]  Brown family church torched in riots.
[00:50:35.955 --> 00:50:37.196]  Yeah, burn a black church down.
[00:50:37.196 --> 00:50:38.856]  That'll show everybody.
[00:50:38.856 --> 00:50:39.557]  And you know what?
[00:50:39.557 --> 00:50:42.438]  If you're against burning down black people's churches, well, you're racist!
[00:50:43.402 --> 00:50:45.744]  Say the black thugs.
[00:50:45.744 --> 00:50:47.626]  Disgusting.
[00:50:47.626 --> 00:50:55.494]  We got a lot of other world news from Russia to the economy, to the strange tale of Canada's Ebola vaccine and more.
[00:50:55.494 --> 00:50:58.898]  It's all coming up on this live Evo Thanksgiving.

[00:52:18.265 --> 00:52:20.407]  Guess Christmas is coming early this year.
[00:52:20.407 --> 00:52:24.210]  I'm definitely ordering one for my brother on Black Friday because the price drops to 400 bucks.
[00:52:25.871 --> 00:52:27.732]  Yes, I did just say that.

[00:52:58.951 --> 00:53:01.092]  Americans, you are being lied to.
[00:53:01.092 --> 00:53:07.174]  Does your skin crawl when a politician or a stock market guru say that we are in the midst of an economic recovery?
[00:53:07.174 --> 00:53:11.356]  According to top insiders, the largest financial meltdown in history is coming.
[00:53:11.356 --> 00:53:15.678]  You can prepare, but if you're living paycheck to paycheck, how do you find the cash?
[00:53:15.678 --> 00:53:20.039]  If you're fortunate enough to have retirement savings, it's probably not enough.
[00:53:20.039 --> 00:53:23.801]  And if it's in the market, it could be wiped out just like the last crash.
[00:53:23.801 --> 00:53:26.802]  But this time it will almost certainly be much worse.
[00:53:27.102 --> 00:53:32.746]  Precious metals are a great hedge, but they won't generate immediate cash flow to pay the bills.
[00:53:32.746 --> 00:53:35.548]  Learn the secret to creating cash flow and freedom.

[00:53:49.999 --> 00:53:55.884]  Traditional retirement may not be in the cards, but re-inspirement can change everything.
[00:53:56.264 --> 00:54:16.207]  BabyBoomerBackUpPlan.com I didn't tease this on purpose, they just informed me this clip's pretty much too long to play in this segment of Jakari getting threatened by a masked goon and others.
[00:54:16.207 --> 00:54:21.928]  The unedited video, because we had to cut out the cuss words, is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:54:21.928 --> 00:54:24.689]  We'll air that at 8 after next hour and then start going to your phone calls.

[00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:45.011]  Yeah, yeah, right.
[00:54:45.011 --> 00:54:52.774]  Ferguson riots, immigration reform, framing coming civil war around race.
[00:54:52.774 --> 00:54:55.135]  That's what's going on.
[00:54:55.135 --> 00:54:58.956]  Was murdered Ferguson man a grand jury witness?
[00:54:58.956 --> 00:55:01.677]  Mass provocateurs confront and threaten reporter in Ferguson.
[00:55:01.677 --> 00:55:03.398]  That's coming up.
[00:55:03.398 --> 00:55:04.378]  Raw courage.
[00:55:04.378 --> 00:55:08.900]  Papa John's female manager defends store from looters with bare hands.
[00:55:09.994 --> 00:55:12.236]  Well, yeah, I mean, it's a racial attack, folks.
[00:55:12.236 --> 00:55:14.137]  Two white guys were attacking a black woman.
[00:55:14.137 --> 00:55:16.078]  Every city burned.
[00:55:16.078 --> 00:55:18.020]  Two FBI agents shot in St.
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:19.080]  Louis.
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:20.161]  There's a report up there.
[00:55:20.161 --> 00:55:24.825]  So, this is getting really out of control with hundreds of demonstrations around the country.
[00:55:24.825 --> 00:55:27.026]  Other stuff, windows getting broken.
[00:55:27.026 --> 00:55:28.347]  I've got a stack of news on that.
[00:55:28.347 --> 00:55:34.071]  180 protesters arrested in overnight demonstrations in downtown L.A.
[00:55:34.071 --> 00:55:36.993]  That's in CBS News.
[00:55:36.993 --> 00:55:37.854]  That's all coming up.
[00:55:39.011 --> 00:55:45.134]  Before this hour ends, I just want to point out that we're able to build this independent media operation thanks to all your support.

[00:56:09.189 --> 00:56:11.532]  I think it's more than that, but that's tomorrow's special.
[00:56:11.532 --> 00:56:12.813]  In fact, will you get them to give me that?
[00:56:12.813 --> 00:56:14.655]  Because I forgot, since I'm already mentioning that.
[00:56:14.655 --> 00:56:19.160]  I mean, these are things we have to go to the manufacturers to get permission to do.
[00:56:20.731 --> 00:56:25.738]  Well, over the next few days, we're running the biggest specials on Infowarslife.com products.
[00:56:25.738 --> 00:56:27.400]  We planned this weeks ago.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:31.185]  We've already sold out of about half the super colloidal silver.
[00:56:31.185 --> 00:56:33.147]  We have silver bullet.
[00:56:33.147 --> 00:56:33.949]  I'm still doing this.
[00:56:35.046 --> 00:56:36.967]  We already sold out a half of it in a few days.
[00:56:36.967 --> 00:56:39.368]  We're still doing this, folks.

[00:56:48.131 --> 00:56:52.553]  Starts today with the sold out Silver Bullet, now back in stock.
[00:56:52.553 --> 00:57:02.677]  We can sell this limited amount for full price or more, but we're giving back to listeners and slashing it by 20% and giving free shipping on top of it.
[00:57:02.677 --> 00:57:03.177]  Did you hear me?

[00:57:15.144 --> 00:57:20.988]  And even with all of these discounts, we're still supporting the InfoWars to keep us going for another 20 years.

[00:57:48.451 --> 00:57:52.734]  And we set this up to only run it for 24 hours, each special each day.
[00:57:52.734 --> 00:57:56.556]  I've already told them we're going to run this for a couple days or until it all sells out.
[00:57:56.556 --> 00:57:59.178]  And again, they can't keep colloidal silver on store shelves.
[00:57:59.178 --> 00:58:02.661]  We've gone out and gotten the best in the country, private labeled.
[00:58:02.661 --> 00:58:03.802]  They're the supplier of
[00:58:04.639 --> 00:58:09.540]  The biggest organic store in the country, who sells it for $5 to $10 more, depending on their sale.
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:13.382]  We already have it at the lowest price, with 20% off and free shipping.
[00:58:13.382 --> 00:58:16.182]  Silver Bullet, I predict they'll sell out in 24 hours.
[00:58:16.182 --> 00:58:17.643]  We won't have any more for months.
[00:58:17.643 --> 00:58:19.143]  But, that's the way it is.
[00:58:19.143 --> 00:58:22.844]  InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:22.844 --> 00:58:25.725]  There's a bunch of other specials.
[00:58:25.725 --> 00:58:27.266]  When you call, they can answer your questions.
[00:58:27.266 --> 00:58:27.506]  888-253-3139.
[00:58:27.506 --> 00:58:28.266]  Alright, second hour!
[00:58:32.527 --> 00:58:33.548]  A ton of news.
[00:58:33.548 --> 00:58:35.049]  A bunch of other news we haven't covered.
[00:58:35.049 --> 00:58:36.430]  Your phone calls and more.
[00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:40.532]  Tell your friends and family to tune in right now.

[00:58:57.054 --> 00:59:02.218]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:59:02.218 --> 00:59:10.944]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:59:10.944 --> 00:59:15.006]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:59:15.006 --> 00:59:17.268]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:59:19.426 --> 00:59:31.235]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:59:31.235 --> 00:59:33.016]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:59:33.016 --> 00:59:35.898]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:59:35.898 --> 00:59:39.981]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[00:59:45.245 --> 00:59:46.826]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:59:46.826 --> 00:59:47.607]  Got it.
[00:59:47.607 --> 00:59:48.368]  Others don't.
[00:59:51.952 --> 00:59:54.580]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:10.811]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.811 --> 01:00:12.391]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.391 --> 01:00:13.952]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.952 --> 01:00:18.132]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.132 --> 01:00:27.354]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.354 --> 01:00:29.455]  We had some amazing callers yesterday.
[01:00:29.455 --> 01:00:32.395]  The Infowars family news crew did an incredible job.
[01:00:32.395 --> 01:00:35.376]  Four hours of live transmissions with our reporters on the ground.
[01:00:36.821 --> 01:00:46.543]  David Knight, of course, Leanne McAdoo, the folks behind the scenes like Marcos Morales and Darren McBrain just did a fabulous job.
[01:00:46.543 --> 01:00:51.885]  Everybody did such a great job here in our little operation that we're trying to expand.
[01:00:51.885 --> 01:00:57.366]  If you just joined us, unfortunately what we predicted is coming true.
[01:00:57.366 --> 01:01:01.187]  Globalist criminals inside our government, the same ones that are funding Al Qaeda and ISIS,
[01:01:02.748 --> 01:01:04.029]  Are trying to destabilize the U.S.
[01:01:04.029 --> 01:01:09.331]  and create racial division and balkanization as a pretext for federalized crackdowns.
[01:01:09.331 --> 01:01:13.373]  But the feds themselves have been seized by the globalists.
[01:01:13.373 --> 01:01:17.755]  And they are running a system right now.
[01:01:17.755 --> 01:01:23.578]  They're establishing a system right now of legitimizing the rollout of this program.
[01:01:23.578 --> 01:01:24.559]  Do you agree with me?
[01:01:24.559 --> 01:01:25.379]  Do you disagree?
[01:01:25.379 --> 01:01:28.561]  I want to leave the phones up for the first round.
[01:01:28.561 --> 01:01:31.062]  Just the first 5-10 calls or so.
[01:01:32.574 --> 01:01:44.742]  Not for first-time callers, not for free-for-all, but for Ferguson residents or others that disagree with my coverage and our angle, our analysis.
[01:01:44.742 --> 01:01:53.969]  I don't see how, if you're being honest, you could disagree with me and just play the Trump card that's been so overplayed, it's worthless, of calling me a racist.
[01:01:57.409 --> 01:02:10.234]  For pointing out the Democratic Party and the news, CNN, MSNBC, are promoting violent demonstrations to demonize the First Amendment, create balkanization, and a pretext for crackdown.
[01:02:10.234 --> 01:02:16.376]  With protests popping up all over the country, with people smashing out windows to then associate protesting with that.
[01:02:16.376 --> 01:02:21.598]  We're going to play the Jakari Jackson confrontation that we bleeped out.
[01:02:21.598 --> 01:02:22.458]  Masked thug.
[01:02:23.826 --> 01:02:28.308]  Masked thugs confront threatened reporter in Ferguson.
[01:02:28.308 --> 01:02:39.472]  I'll show you a terrorist rioter told reporter.
[01:02:39.472 --> 01:02:48.836]  So that's a Kit Daniels report that's up on Infowars.com.
[01:02:48.836 --> 01:02:53.418]  That's all coming up at the start of the next segment.
[01:02:55.714 --> 01:03:07.082]  Then we're going to get into other news that we've not been covering while we've been distracted by this whole Ferguson situation that could blow up to engulf the entire country.
[01:03:07.082 --> 01:03:08.903]  I don't normally cover
[01:03:09.994 --> 01:03:23.145]  Let's be honest, 95% of the news articles about me, every day, there's a whole bunch of big blogs or online newspapers, Daily Beast, Raw Story, Young Turks, the list goes on and on that attack us.
[01:03:23.145 --> 01:03:27.168]  Media Matters, White House Run, MSNBC every few weeks.
[01:03:27.168 --> 01:03:33.593]  I was told I was attacked on MSNBC last night by somebody I saw at a gas station.
[01:03:33.593 --> 01:03:36.336]  We don't just cover stuff because it's about us.
[01:03:36.336 --> 01:03:37.837]  We cover it if it illustrates something.
[01:03:39.503 --> 01:03:43.004]  Don Salazar walked up to me before the show today and he said, have you seen this?
[01:03:43.004 --> 01:03:47.425]  And reportedly this is in the magazine as well, which is in pretty much every Texas home.
[01:03:47.425 --> 01:03:48.466]  It is a big magazine.
[01:03:48.466 --> 01:03:52.807]  It's in the top 20 in the country.
[01:03:52.807 --> 01:03:58.809]  And I've been featured in a serious profile they did that was pretty fair overall.
[01:03:58.809 --> 01:04:01.610]  This is bizarre and this is getting really weird.
[01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:08.892]  The article halfway looks at it and is halfway serious saying I may be Bill Hicks basically.
[01:04:09.591 --> 01:04:11.555]  I mean, this is really getting weird now, man.
[01:04:11.555 --> 01:04:17.606]  People have gone to Rockwall, Texas and gotten my annuals.
[01:04:17.606 --> 01:04:21.332]  They've gone and somehow got my birth certificate, and then they think that's fake.
[01:04:22.614 --> 01:04:24.995]  And all because Kevin Booth lived here in Austin.
[01:04:24.995 --> 01:04:25.575]  He lives in L.A.
[01:04:25.575 --> 01:04:26.656]  now.
[01:04:26.656 --> 01:04:28.076]  And I knew him at Axis Television.
[01:04:28.076 --> 01:04:32.398]  He produced some of Bill Hicks' records and Ninja Bachelor Party.
[01:04:32.398 --> 01:04:36.060]  And so, therefore, I look a little bit like Bill Hicks, so I'm him.
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:41.762]  I mean, this is just Twilight Zone at a major magazine.
[01:04:41.762 --> 01:04:43.183]  I mean, can you imagine?
[01:04:43.183 --> 01:04:44.944]  Because I've talked to some of the family years ago.
[01:04:44.944 --> 01:04:46.464]  This has been going on for about five years.
[01:04:46.464 --> 01:04:48.705]  They're very upset about this.
[01:04:48.705 --> 01:04:50.166]  And Bill Hicks is in the ground, folks.
[01:04:51.403 --> 01:04:53.709]  Kevin was there when he died.
[01:04:53.709 --> 01:04:54.552]  Pancreatic cancer.
[01:04:54.552 --> 01:04:55.815]  It's not funny.
[01:04:55.815 --> 01:04:58.502]  It's sick.
[01:04:58.502 --> 01:04:58.984]  Very sick.
[01:05:00.137 --> 01:05:03.798]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:03.798 --> 01:05:08.060]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:09.840]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:17.703]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:17.703 --> 01:05:18.843]  But for how long?
[01:05:18.843 --> 01:05:25.485]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:05:25.485 --> 01:05:28.306]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.

[01:05:59.585 --> 01:06:01.586]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:06:01.586 --> 01:06:06.108]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[01:06:06.108 --> 01:06:10.571]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:06:10.571 --> 01:06:17.894]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:06:17.894 --> 01:06:26.959]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:06:27.179 --> 01:06:32.722]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:40.307]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.

[01:06:59.491 --> 01:07:04.733]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:07:04.733 --> 01:07:11.055]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:07:11.055 --> 01:07:18.358]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:07:18.358 --> 01:07:28.261]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[01:07:28.861 --> 01:07:35.025]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:07:35.025 --> 01:07:38.107]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[01:07:38.107 --> 01:07:39.869]  And adenosylcobalamin.
[01:07:39.869 --> 01:07:43.471]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:07:43.471 --> 01:07:45.352]  No needles, no injections.
[01:07:45.352 --> 01:07:47.013]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:07:47.013 --> 01:07:48.214]  Try it for yourself.
[01:07:48.214 --> 01:07:50.496]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[01:08:02.345 --> 01:08:07.990]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:14.856]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've been telling you the last few months the reason we've been focused
[01:08:25.683 --> 01:08:41.168]  Quite a bit of our time on Ferguson is because if you watch CNN, MSNBC, White House-run Media Matters, the Justice Department from Trayvon Martin right up to now, they are in there trying to stir things up.
[01:08:41.168 --> 01:08:44.309]  And then they have Obama come out and call for calm on the top.
[01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:47.230]  But this is the Democratic Party's policy.
[01:08:47.230 --> 01:08:49.871]  And if you look at the White House demonstrations and the L.A.
[01:08:49.871 --> 01:08:54.033]  demonstrations and the New York demonstrations and all the rest of them, hundreds,
[01:08:54.844 --> 01:08:56.305]  People taking over highways, you name it.
[01:08:56.305 --> 01:08:57.506]  Knocking windows out.
[01:08:57.506 --> 01:08:58.647]  Hundreds of arrests per city.
[01:08:58.647 --> 01:09:00.749]  180 in L.A.
[01:09:00.749 --> 01:09:02.070]  alone.
[01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:03.050]  You look at the signs.
[01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:08.434]  It's communist groups, socialist groups that are issuing the signs, priming it, running it.
[01:09:08.434 --> 01:09:13.859]  Democratic party groups, socialists, connected Soros groups.
[01:09:13.859 --> 01:09:17.862]  And there's been reports out in the media on this, showing it, getting this going.
[01:09:18.922 --> 01:09:30.072]  Because Obama is imploding, and their whole socialist agenda is falling on its face, and there's moves towards impeachment, and hearings, and lawsuits, and Obamacare could get overturned, and the globalists want to wreck this country.
[01:09:30.072 --> 01:09:34.697]  Cloward and Piven, Agenda 21, it's happening.
[01:09:34.697 --> 01:09:37.039]  So, they desperately want to divide and conquer.
[01:09:37.039 --> 01:09:44.626]  That's what the Romans did, the British did, that's what empires do when they're outnumbered 1,000 to 1, is they get the natives fighting with each other.
[01:09:46.667 --> 01:09:48.788]  Now, do I lionize local police departments?
[01:09:48.788 --> 01:09:50.488]  Are there some issues with the Ferguson Department?
[01:09:50.488 --> 01:09:51.568]  Absolutely.
[01:09:51.568 --> 01:09:52.609]  But let's pull back.
[01:09:52.609 --> 01:09:55.069]  It doesn't matter who's right or wrong here.
[01:09:55.069 --> 01:09:57.450]  The media is shy-opping this.
[01:09:57.450 --> 01:10:13.935]  And then if you call people shooting up police vehicles and fire department vehicles, shooting two FBI agents, shooting two police officers, killing somebody else in their car, threatening our reporters, throwing rocks at reporters, black reporters, burning down black churches,
[01:10:15.509 --> 01:10:25.895]  And then we say it's horrible, and we say it's terrorism to shoot at fire trucks and firefighters, and our reporters heard bullets going by their head.
[01:10:25.895 --> 01:10:29.657]  Joe Biggs heard about a hundred shots in just a one-minute period.
[01:10:29.657 --> 01:10:30.778]  And he's been in heavy combat.
[01:10:30.778 --> 01:10:40.404]  I mean, Joe never really talks about it, but you can read where he was embedded with Rolling Stone and with Esquire in the big battles they were in.
[01:10:40.404 --> 01:10:41.504]  And he knows what it sounds like.
[01:10:41.504 --> 01:10:42.265]  That was going on.
[01:10:43.513 --> 01:10:50.135]  And you've got the police standing down up front to exacerbate the rioting.
[01:10:50.135 --> 01:10:53.137]  They used the LA riots in 92 to militarize police.
[01:10:53.137 --> 01:10:58.559]  They're going to do it again because there's a major public backlash against federalization, the armored vehicles, the rest of it.
[01:10:58.559 --> 01:11:02.380]  And I didn't just come out and say this today.
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:02.740]  U.S.
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:11.664]  Army training to fight black Americans, doomsday Disneyland facility used as practice ground for civil unrest.
[01:11:11.664 --> 01:11:12.604]  You know, I just thought about it.
[01:11:13.959 --> 01:11:22.687]  I want to get Paul Watson on, maybe at the start of the next hour or something to give us his take on all this, because I know he's right in the middle of researching and reporting it.
[01:11:22.687 --> 01:11:23.968]  I want to get his angle.
[01:11:23.968 --> 01:11:29.494]  Our reporters that I've pulled out, because now it's spreading nationwide, I think 10 days is enough for them in Ferguson.
[01:11:29.494 --> 01:11:32.216]  Jakari and Joe are about to land in about 30 minutes.
[01:11:32.216 --> 01:11:36.840]  We're going to try to get them in here in studio, give us a take on what happened last night.
[01:11:37.621 --> 01:11:43.323]  By the way, this radio crew slash TV crew also worked until 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock last night over there.
[01:11:43.323 --> 01:11:54.247]  So just the whole crew working around the clock with our skeleton operation to bring you serious major news coverage of what's happening.
[01:11:54.247 --> 01:11:59.009]  Just pointing out that that's how far the alternative media has come now becoming the media.
[01:12:03.331 --> 01:12:09.788]  So, they've been preparing this, preparing for this shy-op, knowing they can manipulate the black community into this, and now it's happening.
[01:12:12.421 --> 01:12:13.821]  That's what's going on.
[01:12:13.821 --> 01:12:15.602]  And now you have retired general calls for U.S.
[01:12:15.602 --> 01:12:17.922]  Army on the streets to restore civil order.
[01:12:17.922 --> 01:12:20.943]  The same general that ran the gun confiscation there in Katrina.
[01:12:20.943 --> 01:12:23.124]  That's what this whole agenda is about.
[01:12:23.124 --> 01:12:25.724]  Get a civil war going so you can bring in U.N.
[01:12:25.724 --> 01:12:27.585]  forces and have gun confiscation.
[01:12:27.585 --> 01:12:30.705]  That's the actual plan out of NORTHCOM and the U.N.
[01:12:30.705 --> 01:12:31.386]  with the U.N.
[01:12:31.386 --> 01:12:36.127]  treaty going into effect December 24th.
[01:12:36.127 --> 01:12:41.108]  I want to hear, and I'm going to open the phones up right now for the first round of people that disagree with me.
[01:12:42.754 --> 01:12:46.077]  And by the way, if you don't really disagree, don't call.
[01:12:46.077 --> 01:12:58.787]  If you really disagree, if you're this thug, in my view, in my opinion, threatening Jakari with a mask on in the middle of all this rioting, clearly a provocateur, whether he works for the government or not, stirring things up, I'd like to hear from you.
[01:12:58.787 --> 01:12:58.847]  800-259-9231.
[01:12:58.847 --> 01:13:02.670]  Because you're clearly listening, you're clearly watching.
[01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:02.710]  800-259-9231.
[01:13:09.636 --> 01:13:18.401]  But at the bottom of all this, socialist and communist ideology is about a violent overthrow of the disenfranchised underclass.
[01:13:18.401 --> 01:13:26.886]  But if you've got a big, rich middle class, people won't want to be part of that system and stand in line to get their sausages and their potatoes like in the Soviet Union.
[01:13:26.886 --> 01:13:28.607]  They won't join with socialists.
[01:13:28.607 --> 01:13:37.092]  So you've got to bankrupt the country first, and that's what shutting our power plants and shutting our jobs off and raising our taxes and all the regulations are about.
[01:13:37.967 --> 01:13:44.529]  While Obama and Al Gore and the rest of them own stock in the Chinese companies.
[01:13:44.529 --> 01:13:47.730]  Who got real Chinese slaves working in them.
[01:13:47.730 --> 01:13:52.992]  It's all a big scam to bring the country down to conquer it.
[01:13:52.992 --> 01:13:54.233]  So here's the toll free number 800-259-9231.
[01:13:54.233 --> 01:13:54.273]  800-259-9231.
[01:14:06.598 --> 01:14:08.320]  800-259-9231.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:16.987]  You can use that Obama phone to call right in here and tell me how I'm wrong.
[01:14:16.987 --> 01:14:20.090]  Tell me how I'm a racist.
[01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:23.213]  Tell me how Brown was sacrificed.
[01:14:23.213 --> 01:14:26.556]  The article's on Infowars.com.
[01:14:26.556 --> 01:14:29.979]  Professor says Mike Brown sacrificed to racist God.
[01:14:31.636 --> 01:14:35.319]  Robbery suspects sacrificed the god of American whiteness.
[01:14:35.319 --> 01:14:36.640]  Oh, is that why the U.S.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.103]  government brings in as many non-Europeans as they can?
[01:14:40.103 --> 01:14:42.265]  There's a white power thing running things?
[01:14:42.265 --> 01:14:45.948]  According to the Associate Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Pennsylvania,
[01:14:47.153 --> 01:14:54.919]  Athena Butler, robbery suspect Mike Brown, was sacrificed to the god of white supremacy.
[01:14:54.919 --> 01:15:00.763]  Butler imbues her diatribe against a racist white America with religious overtones.
[01:15:00.763 --> 01:15:06.808]  Yeah, because the cop wanted to have to basically lose his job now and he wanted to be hunted and hated and go through all this.
[01:15:06.808 --> 01:15:07.789]  I'm sure that's why he did it.
[01:15:07.789 --> 01:15:10.511]  No, it's because he got beat up and was being charged again and was scared.
[01:15:14.221 --> 01:15:19.002]  No one should be surprised that Darren Wilson was not indicted by the grand jury.
[01:15:19.002 --> 01:15:26.144]  Prosecutor Robert McCulloch, as they say it, played a role of conscious pilot.
[01:15:26.144 --> 01:15:29.724]  Oh, see, Brown was a Christ figure, folks.
[01:15:29.724 --> 01:15:32.985]  Strong-arming people for cigarettes or cigars.
[01:15:32.985 --> 01:15:36.546]  Washing his hands and Darren Wilson's hands of impunity.
[01:15:37.793 --> 01:15:45.298]  While the sacrifice, Michael Brown, was deemed worthy of death because, in Wilson's words, he looked like a demon.
[01:15:45.298 --> 01:15:48.520]  Well, he looks like a demon in some of his gangster photos.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.521]  He got his stepdad saying, burn everything down.
[01:15:50.521 --> 01:15:52.563]  I mean, man.
[01:15:52.563 --> 01:16:03.530]  Wilson even uses the sacred instrument to complete his sacrifice to the god of American whiteness, the gun.
[01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:05.351]  Really, mousy tongues have political power.
[01:16:05.351 --> 01:16:06.252]  It goes out of the barrel of a gun.
[01:16:07.429 --> 01:16:13.454]  I'm trying to get guns into people's hands so they can protect themselves regardless of their color.
[01:16:13.454 --> 01:16:15.115]  And then it just goes on from there.
[01:16:15.115 --> 01:16:30.107]  Let's go to this piece, this clip, raw footage actually, of Jakari Jackson last night during live coverage with someone approaching up, who I think's a thug, with a mask on saying, I'll show you terrorists, implying that we said all protesters are terrorists.
[01:16:30.107 --> 01:16:32.709]  No, we said people shooting at firefighters.
[01:16:34.261 --> 01:16:38.524]  That's an act of terrorism by any stretch of the imagination, and I stand by it and I'm proud of it.
[01:16:38.524 --> 01:16:48.030]  Let's go to the clip.
[01:16:48.030 --> 01:16:49.891]  Tell me how great Alex is.
[01:16:49.891 --> 01:16:52.833]  Tell me how he's the Jesus Christ of the world.
[01:16:52.833 --> 01:16:54.575]  Tell me how you his boy.
[01:16:54.575 --> 01:16:57.937]  I ain't never said he Jesus, bro.
[01:16:57.937 --> 01:16:59.698]  You know, a lot of people say you a sellout.
[01:17:00.376 --> 01:17:01.580]  How am I still not jumping?
[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:03.565]  Because Alex is using you!
[01:17:03.565 --> 01:17:04.087]  That's right.
[01:17:06.084 --> 01:17:07.966]  You don't love black people.
[01:17:07.966 --> 01:17:11.149]  You down here is his stooge.
[01:17:11.149 --> 01:17:13.811]  Because you don't.
[01:17:13.811 --> 01:17:14.712]  Because you don't.
[01:17:14.712 --> 01:17:16.854]  Because you his stooge.
[01:17:16.854 --> 01:17:18.736]  You his stooge.
[01:17:18.736 --> 01:17:20.157]  Alex is a racist.
[01:17:20.157 --> 01:17:22.940]  And so is that other cat you down here with.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:25.543]  We came down here specifically.
[01:17:25.543 --> 01:17:28.525]  I'm telling you and I'm giving you a real answer.
[01:17:28.525 --> 01:17:29.386]  You a sellout.
[01:17:30.947 --> 01:17:32.808]  You called us terrorists.
[01:17:32.808 --> 01:17:35.629]  You didn't think I found that, did you?
[01:17:35.629 --> 01:17:36.990]  Yeah, you scared now, ain't you?
[01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:38.731]  I ain't scared of you.
[01:17:38.731 --> 01:17:41.772]  I said whoever out here doing burning down the buildings, that ain't supposed to happen.
[01:17:41.772 --> 01:17:43.393]  Oh, we terrorists or not?
[01:17:43.393 --> 01:17:45.954]  Not black people, people who burn down buildings.
[01:17:45.954 --> 01:17:47.814]  If you burn down a building, then you got some issues.
[01:17:47.814 --> 01:17:50.055]  The white boy you wish said we terrorists.
[01:17:50.055 --> 01:17:51.196]  Bring him here!
[01:17:51.756 --> 01:17:56.540]  Bring him here and tell him to call us terrorists in our face!
[01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:58.262]  You freaking sellout!
[01:17:58.262 --> 01:17:59.563]  You freaking sellout!
[01:17:59.563 --> 01:18:03.386]  Go away with the enemies, you freaking sellout!
[01:18:03.386 --> 01:18:09.411]  Jay Biggs, whatever his name is, Alex Jones, tell Alex Jones to come here!
[01:18:09.411 --> 01:18:11.993]  He's seeing his boy here!
[01:18:11.993 --> 01:18:15.456]  So you can mingle around the people and call us terrorists!
[01:18:15.456 --> 01:18:16.758]  But how is he not racist?
[01:18:17.518 --> 01:18:19.200]  He ain't no racist!
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.501]  Tell me how he racist!
[01:18:20.501 --> 01:18:21.863]  You freaking sellout!
[01:18:21.863 --> 01:18:23.404]  Man, I ain't gonna lie, I ain't in front of cameras.
[01:18:23.404 --> 01:18:26.107]  I ain't in front of cameras, you know what I'm saying?
[01:18:26.107 --> 01:18:27.589]  I came over here because he was talking to me.
[01:18:27.589 --> 01:18:29.250]  I came over here looking for you!
[01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:32.934]  Because your boy called us terrorists today!
[01:18:32.934 --> 01:18:34.976]  No, no, he called us terrorists!
[01:18:34.976 --> 01:18:35.677]  No, he did not.
[01:18:35.677 --> 01:18:37.038]  You bring him here!
[01:18:37.038 --> 01:18:38.860]  Bring him and Alex here!
[01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:40.141]  Bring him and Alex here!
[01:18:40.942 --> 01:18:42.843]  I'll show you a Terrence!
[01:18:42.843 --> 01:18:45.325]  Let me explain.
[01:18:45.325 --> 01:18:47.246]  I'm listening to you.
[01:18:47.246 --> 01:18:48.708]  Because you work for them!
[01:18:48.708 --> 01:18:49.308]  You're not for us!
[01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:50.249]  You're not for us!
[01:18:50.249 --> 01:18:52.750]  You're gonna let me talk or what?
[01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:54.231]  I'm listening to you.
[01:18:54.231 --> 01:18:55.032]  I'm not listening to you.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:02.123]  We're talking about whoever's burning down the buildings and all that stuff, they ain't supposed to be asking.
[01:19:02.123 --> 01:19:03.745]  We ain't never said black people in general.
[01:19:03.745 --> 01:19:05.526]  Hey look, that's logic, man!
[01:19:05.526 --> 01:19:06.067]  That's right!
[01:19:06.067 --> 01:19:06.647]  We understand that!
[01:19:06.647 --> 01:19:07.268]  That's logic!
[01:19:07.268 --> 01:19:08.609]  That's logic, man!
[01:19:08.609 --> 01:19:09.710]  What are y'all stating that for?
[01:19:09.710 --> 01:19:10.290]  That's right!
[01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:11.612]  This man got away with murder!
[01:19:11.612 --> 01:19:12.232]  That's right!
[01:19:12.232 --> 01:19:14.214]  And what are we supposed to do?
[01:19:14.214 --> 01:19:14.915]  Be peaceful?
[01:19:15.635 --> 01:19:16.336]  Bring him here!
[01:19:16.336 --> 01:19:21.579]  If I kill or rape your sister, what am I going to do?
[01:19:21.579 --> 01:19:25.542]  Do you want me to be peaceful?
[01:19:25.542 --> 01:19:30.064]  If I kill or rape your sister, do you want me to be peaceful?
[01:19:30.064 --> 01:19:34.407]  Am I charged or am I responding to what I did to your sister?
[01:19:34.407 --> 01:19:36.388]  If you want to respond, talk to the police.
[01:19:36.388 --> 01:19:38.230]  No, I'm asking you.
[01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:44.274]  If I rape and kill your sister, do you respond to me with peace or not?
[01:19:51.636 --> 01:19:54.297]  Back it up 20-30 seconds.
[01:19:54.297 --> 01:20:00.778]  This guy, demonstrator out there with the other rioters, I don't know if he's involved in anything, probably not.
[01:20:00.778 --> 01:20:03.079]  But he's certainly angry and he's probably been a listener.
[01:20:04.304 --> 01:20:07.145]  But he's inherently, in my opinion, in view, very racist.
[01:20:07.145 --> 01:20:09.585]  He sees things all according to race.
[01:20:09.585 --> 01:20:25.568]  What I said is, people, I was very clear, and you can find the tape, the video from yesterday, I probably said it 15 times, shooting at fire department people with the bullets slamming into the fire trucks with bullet holes in them.
[01:20:25.568 --> 01:20:29.329]  And the media is so behind the looters that they're not even showing the bullet holes.
[01:20:29.329 --> 01:20:30.849]  We have photos of video, we've shown it.
[01:20:31.857 --> 01:20:40.100]  Burning down Brown's Church, attacking Mexican food restaurants, attacking a white lady at Papa John's who makes $12 an hour.
[01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:51.264]  Man, if somebody kills and rapes your sister and you don't get justice, they wrote a book about it, it's fiction, but there is a time to kill.
[01:20:51.264 --> 01:20:57.727]  Let me tell you, somebody kills somebody in my family, and I know they did it, and I saw them do it, and they get away with it, there'll be some justice, don't you worry.
[01:20:59.691 --> 01:21:01.072]  Oh, somebody shot a black guy.
[01:21:01.072 --> 01:21:01.952]  I think it was wrong.
[01:21:01.952 --> 01:21:04.054]  Let me go burn down the black church.
[01:21:04.054 --> 01:21:05.594]  Let me go over here.
[01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:09.957]  Let me go over here and beat up a white lady at Papa John's.
[01:21:09.957 --> 01:21:11.898]  Shoot, who's oppressing you?
[01:21:11.898 --> 01:21:12.298]  Well, guess what?
[01:21:12.298 --> 01:21:16.180]  There won't be any pizza places in your area now.
[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:22.184]  Some guy gets off work, who's black or white, whatever, wants a pizza, you're not getting it.
[01:21:22.184 --> 01:21:25.005]  All that stuff's gonna just shut down.
[01:21:25.005 --> 01:21:26.086]  Think about the logic.
[01:21:26.086 --> 01:21:27.787]  We're mad, so...
[01:21:29.628 --> 01:21:31.089]  You said we're terrorists.
[01:21:31.089 --> 01:21:36.393]  Uh, no, uh, and Jakari defended me, but he, you know, in fairness, he wasn't there listening.
[01:21:36.393 --> 01:21:39.476]  So, you know, he says, well, I'll explain if you're burning things as terrorism.
[01:21:39.476 --> 01:21:45.060]  Well, that's arson and that is a form of terrorism, but you just get charged under arson.
[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:50.345]  When you go out and try to shoot and kill people who are trying to put fires out to create fear,
[01:21:51.616 --> 01:21:52.416]  That's terrorism.
[01:21:52.416 --> 01:21:54.417]  And I didn't say this guy or anybody else did that.
[01:21:54.417 --> 01:21:55.918]  I said whoever did it, did it.
[01:21:55.918 --> 01:21:59.420]  And those people should have been shot.
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:00.840]  Let me just explain something to you.
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:04.962]  I'm driving down the road and I see somebody randomly shooting.
[01:22:04.962 --> 01:22:08.664]  I'm going to pull over, get my rifle, get behind the truck and I'm going to shoot you.
[01:22:08.664 --> 01:22:13.446]  Not because I want to kill anybody, but my instinct is, ladies and gentlemen, I mean, I'm not bragging.
[01:22:13.446 --> 01:22:14.887]  I don't know what's wrong with people.
[01:22:14.887 --> 01:22:15.647]  I told the story.
[01:22:15.647 --> 01:22:16.368]  My wife was there.
[01:22:16.368 --> 01:22:18.909]  My son was like a year old.
[01:22:18.909 --> 01:22:21.290]  I was at La Madeline, a little restaurant.
[01:22:23.288 --> 01:22:24.289]  This woman's choking.
[01:22:24.289 --> 01:22:26.450]  I mean, I go to the bathroom.
[01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:27.071]  We're about to leave.
[01:22:27.071 --> 01:22:40.181]  I come out, and everybody's around this table, like 15 people around this table, and this lady is choking, turning blue, and they're like parrots going, call 911, call 911, call 911, call 911.
[01:22:40.181 --> 01:22:42.403]  I started going, listen, anybody know how to do the Heimlich?
[01:22:42.403 --> 01:22:45.025]  I took those classes and stuff when I was on swim team.
[01:22:45.025 --> 01:22:49.128]  I didn't want to do it, because there's lawsuits you can break a rib.
[01:22:49.128 --> 01:22:51.430]  But I said, somebody in here, a doctor, a nurse, do the Heimlich.
[01:22:52.230 --> 01:22:55.171]  They all just keep going, 9-1-1, 9-1-1, 9-1-1.
[01:22:55.171 --> 01:22:57.832]  See, the government's gonna handle it.
[01:22:57.832 --> 01:23:00.233]  It's the same entitlement mentality.
[01:23:00.233 --> 01:23:01.974]  So she starts falling on the table, turning blue.
[01:23:01.974 --> 01:23:03.294]  She's clearly gonna pass out.
[01:23:03.294 --> 01:23:05.295]  Then she's so big, probably weighs 380 pounds.
[01:23:05.295 --> 01:23:07.536]  I'm not gonna be able to get her up.
[01:23:07.536 --> 01:23:09.376]  So I say, that's it.
[01:23:09.376 --> 01:23:14.238]  Had to push people aside, grab a huge piece of bread comes out.
[01:23:14.238 --> 01:23:15.579]  Everybody's, oh, you're a hero, you're a hero.
[01:23:15.579 --> 01:23:16.939]  But they were all kind of looking at me weird.
[01:23:16.939 --> 01:23:18.000]  Next comes the lawsuit.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:18.540]  I was out of there.
[01:23:19.753 --> 01:23:23.095]  Because another thing in America, there's a bunch of fat white people.
[01:23:23.095 --> 01:23:28.098]  Another thing in America is, it's bad to help somebody too.
[01:23:28.098 --> 01:23:29.599]  So don't ever forget about that.
[01:23:29.599 --> 01:23:31.239]  And I wasn't going off into a story.
[01:23:31.239 --> 01:23:33.901]  I'll guarantee you.
[01:23:33.901 --> 01:23:35.282]  I will guarantee you.
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:38.921]  And by the way, there's video of this somewhere, I'm not just saying this.
[01:23:38.921 --> 01:23:47.264]  I went out to a La Raza rally one time downtown, with a bullhorn, followed them in their face, saying they were racist, and had like 10 guys come and say they were gonna kick my ass, and I said, let's go!
[01:23:47.264 --> 01:23:48.464]  And they backed off.
[01:23:48.464 --> 01:23:51.325]  I'm not saying I'm tough either, but I'm not backing down.
[01:23:51.325 --> 01:23:57.207]  That's why I don't go to these events, because I'd have probably gotten a fight.
[01:23:57.207 --> 01:24:02.229]  I mean, I am sick and tired of ignorant morons.
[01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:03.409]  Makes me want to throw up.
[01:24:05.694 --> 01:24:07.096]  And I know racists when I see them.
[01:24:07.096 --> 01:24:17.992]  I've protested the Klan, La Raza, Mecha, and... I grew up in Dallas, and I had a lot of black friends, but I learned real quick, there's nice black people, and there's racist black people.
[01:24:18.931 --> 01:24:28.318]  And racist black people are some of the most entitled, racist people you will ever run into, and they just think that it's their right to hate you because of your skin color.
[01:24:28.318 --> 01:24:29.118]  And you know what?
[01:24:29.118 --> 01:24:36.523]  I'm not a bigot, though, and I'm not small-minded, so I'm not going to write off all the great black people out there because there's a bunch of dumb racists out there.
[01:24:36.523 --> 01:24:39.746]  But I'm telling you, I'm sick of it.
[01:24:39.746 --> 01:24:44.489]  This thing is a shy-op, and these people love the attention.
[01:24:44.489 --> 01:24:45.510]  And they can do this with any group.
[01:24:46.411 --> 01:25:02.099]  You know, with a kid in a well, or a missing baby, or... It's this narcissistic culture where you just show, oh, the brown thing, or oh, you know, the mystery of who is the guest model, you know, and her death and all that.
[01:25:02.099 --> 01:25:03.340]  Whatever the diversion is.
[01:25:06.246 --> 01:25:10.709]  And everybody just gets into, they're on TV, the news is paying attention to them.
[01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:20.694]  Only as a psy-op to tell other people go out and riot, go out and loot, go out and chant racist slogans to demonize demonstrating so the globalists can take over the country.
[01:25:20.694 --> 01:25:22.095]  That's what's going on.
[01:25:22.095 --> 01:25:24.817]  What is it you don't understand about that?
[01:25:27.799 --> 01:25:36.684]  James of Missouri disagrees on our coverage, Jason disagrees on some points, David Oregon disagrees, Stephen New Jersey disagrees, thinks riots are necessary.
[01:25:36.684 --> 01:25:50.973]  I'm going to tell you something, and I'm not calling for this, but if people attack pharmaceutical companies like Bayer, that was caught shipping out hundreds of thousands, well at one time, millions over the years of Factor VIII, that they knew
[01:25:52.984 --> 01:25:59.309]  Had HIV and Hepatitis in it to kill little hemophiliac kids of every color under the rainbow.
[01:25:59.309 --> 01:26:04.454]  And then they didn't get indicted in the U.S., they only did in France and Australia, got found guilty.
[01:26:04.454 --> 01:26:15.323]  If somebody's kid got killed by that, and they went in and did something, I would say, well, Bayer, you know, I don't want to handle things this way, but this is an eye for an eye.
[01:26:15.323 --> 01:26:17.185]  You're not going after
[01:26:19.427 --> 01:26:20.628]  Who you say did it.
[01:26:20.628 --> 01:26:24.589]  Plus, it looks like Brown was a thug.
[01:26:24.589 --> 01:26:27.890]  The media picked this out of all the cases they could have picked.
[01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:30.571]  Where cops shoot black men in the back all the time.
[01:26:30.571 --> 01:26:31.412]  They didn't pick that.
[01:26:31.412 --> 01:26:37.154]  The media picked this because it's a loser and it'll make you look bad.
[01:26:37.154 --> 01:26:39.534]  It's a setup to demonize black people.
[01:26:39.534 --> 01:26:40.835]  But oh, I'm racist.
[01:26:42.014 --> 01:26:43.795]  What an ignoramus.
[01:26:43.795 --> 01:26:47.217]  That guy will never go protest that 52% of blacks get aborted.
[01:26:47.217 --> 01:26:54.282]  He'll never protest that fluoride, I said double, it's true, three to six times worse for black people in all the major studies you can look it up.
[01:26:54.282 --> 01:26:55.063]  Just on and on and on.
[01:26:55.063 --> 01:26:55.523]  You know what?
[01:26:55.523 --> 01:27:02.227]  It's so painful that you're just so racist I can't help you.
[01:27:02.227 --> 01:27:03.688]  And you'll go down with a ship, I get it.
[01:27:03.688 --> 01:27:04.809]  That's why America's probably done.
[01:27:04.809 --> 01:27:08.632]  Because it's not just black folks, you know, in the inner city that have been dumped down, it's everybody.
[01:27:09.571 --> 01:27:10.796]  I mean black, white, you name it.
[01:27:10.796 --> 01:27:15.614]  I run into folks that are so stupid or so set on what they believe that you can't even reach them.
[01:27:16.684 --> 01:27:17.944]  And it makes me want to throw up.
[01:27:17.944 --> 01:27:22.286]  Let's go back to the rest of the confrontation, and then we're going to go to break and come back with the folks who disagree with me.
[01:27:22.286 --> 01:27:22.766]  Here it is.
[01:27:22.766 --> 01:27:24.466]  Do you want me to be peaceful?
[01:27:24.466 --> 01:27:28.988]  If I kill and rape your sister, do you want me to be peaceful?
[01:27:28.988 --> 01:27:33.329]  Am I charged or am I responding to what I did to your sister?
[01:27:33.329 --> 01:27:34.990]  If you want to respond, talk to the police.
[01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:37.550]  No, I'm asking you.
[01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:41.472]  If I rape and kill your sister, talk to the police.
[01:27:41.472 --> 01:27:45.633]  If I rape and kill your sister, will Jakari then go and attack the Papa Johns?
[01:27:47.912 --> 01:27:52.995]  I mean, that'd be like if somebody raped my sister and then I went down the road randomly and just found somebody else to blame.
[01:27:52.995 --> 01:27:54.796]  I mean, it's crazy!
[01:27:54.796 --> 01:27:56.057]  It's crazy!
[01:27:56.057 --> 01:27:57.598]  You're crazy!
[01:27:57.598 --> 01:27:59.019]  Let's go back to the clip.
[01:27:59.019 --> 01:28:02.340]  You respond to me with proof or not?
[01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:03.941]  You ain't trusting us!
[01:28:03.941 --> 01:28:04.142]  No!
[01:28:04.142 --> 01:28:04.582]  Alright then!
[01:28:04.582 --> 01:28:05.602]  Alright then!
[01:28:05.602 --> 01:28:07.143]  Who's more willing to not shoot Michael Brown?
[01:28:07.143 --> 01:28:08.964]  I'm not, don't get off the subject!
[01:28:08.964 --> 01:28:10.305]  Don't get off the subject!
[01:28:10.305 --> 01:28:11.966]  Don't get off the subject!
[01:28:11.966 --> 01:28:13.367]  You better get your fingers out!
[01:28:13.607 --> 01:28:15.669]  You are, yes!
[01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:18.150]  This is what I'm saying.
[01:28:18.150 --> 01:28:21.253]  The subject is that this man got away with murder.
[01:28:21.253 --> 01:28:21.733]  Yes.
[01:28:21.733 --> 01:28:27.878]  That's, and the way that the youth, the way that the youth express their feelings, they're wrong.
[01:28:27.878 --> 01:28:28.839]  There he is!
[01:28:28.839 --> 01:28:31.220]  That's the one who calls black people murderers!
[01:28:33.622 --> 01:28:34.602]  Yes, you did!
[01:28:34.602 --> 01:28:36.203]  You said it today!
[01:28:36.203 --> 01:28:37.444]  You didn't say that!
[01:28:37.444 --> 01:28:39.264]  You didn't say that!
[01:28:39.264 --> 01:28:42.726]  No, I said the people who are burning down buildings did that.
[01:28:42.726 --> 01:28:44.987]  As long as you deny it!
[01:28:44.987 --> 01:28:45.987]  As long as you deny it!
[01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:46.107]  Go!
[01:28:46.107 --> 01:28:46.387]  Go!
[01:28:46.387 --> 01:28:47.088]  That was horrible.
[01:28:47.088 --> 01:28:47.548]  Go!
[01:28:47.548 --> 01:28:51.029]  You ain't supposed to burn any buildings, bro.
[01:28:51.029 --> 01:28:51.590]  Go!
[01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:52.510]  I said pause right there.
[01:28:54.181 --> 01:28:59.103]  I also love how folks always attack you, and if you speak out, you go, don't censor me!
[01:28:59.103 --> 01:29:01.865]  When they're attacking you, your speech is now censorship.
[01:29:01.865 --> 01:29:06.167]  Or, go get out of here, which is clearly, you know, get out of here or I'll show you terrorists.
[01:29:06.167 --> 01:29:07.848]  Get out of here or I'll show you terrorists.
[01:29:07.848 --> 01:29:11.990]  In my view, that's a terroristic threat.
[01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:16.332]  Trying to violate Joe Biggs' First Amendment as a citizen and as a journalist.
[01:29:16.332 --> 01:29:18.313]  Violating our rights.
[01:29:18.313 --> 01:29:19.313]  And that's what you're there.
[01:29:19.313 --> 01:29:21.174]  You're there to spoil the First Amendment.
[01:29:22.332 --> 01:29:25.974]  We're gonna come back and finish it and go right to your calls.
[01:29:25.974 --> 01:29:27.215]  Oh my gosh.
[01:29:27.215 --> 01:29:32.218]  I tell you, that guy's really lucky that Jakari... By the way, I didn't hire Jakari because he's black.
[01:29:32.218 --> 01:29:38.981]  I hired him because he's smart, he submitted one of the best videos and won a contest, and he just does a great job, and...
[01:29:40.302 --> 01:29:43.827]  It's just, believe me, if I could hire five more people like him, I would.
[01:29:43.827 --> 01:29:45.188]  I don't care what color they are.
[01:29:45.188 --> 01:29:45.909]  Unbelievable.
[01:29:45.909 --> 01:29:48.112]  Yeah, don't give him any merit that he's a good reporter.
[01:29:48.112 --> 01:29:50.135]  Just say it's because he's black.
[01:29:50.135 --> 01:29:51.757]  Unbelievable!
[01:29:51.757 --> 01:29:52.878]  Unbelievable!
[01:29:52.878 --> 01:29:55.562]  Alex Jones and GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.986 --> 01:30:06.408]  When I first got online and I seen the price of the X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[01:30:06.408 --> 01:30:07.389]  It has changed my life.
[01:30:07.389 --> 01:30:11.090]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now, counting the weights, staying in shape.
[01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:13.130]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:30:13.130 --> 01:30:15.071]  You've heard the callers of the show.
[01:30:15.071 --> 01:30:19.092]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super meal.
[01:30:19.092 --> 01:30:21.073]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[01:30:21.073 --> 01:30:23.714]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[01:30:23.814 --> 01:30:41.293]  Whether it's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine or DNA Force, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shield, Oxy Powder, I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:41.753 --> 01:30:47.335]  There's just amazing what it's able to do to actually detox the body.
[01:30:47.335 --> 01:30:48.095]  It's great stuff.
[01:30:48.095 --> 01:30:52.196]  If I'm going to promote something, it's got to be something I personally use and that I believe in.
[01:30:52.196 --> 01:30:58.938]  Check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[01:31:00.274 --> 01:31:09.940]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:19.865]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:31:19.865 --> 01:31:22.787]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:31:22.987 --> 01:31:23.267]  I think?
[01:31:37.944 --> 01:31:38.204]  We're good.
[01:32:01.391 --> 01:32:02.712]  In the near future.
[01:32:02.712 --> 01:32:07.213]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:32:07.213 --> 01:32:08.454]  Security alert.
[01:32:08.454 --> 01:32:10.455]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:32:10.455 --> 01:32:11.335]  Analysis.
[01:32:11.335 --> 01:32:14.156]  InfoWars building independent media operations.
[01:32:14.156 --> 01:32:19.038]  We let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:32:19.038 --> 01:32:21.619]  Crime directive discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:21.619 --> 01:32:24.461]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:24.461 --> 01:32:27.722]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:27.722 --> 01:32:29.883]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:30.183 --> 01:32:31.523]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:32:31.523 --> 01:32:33.704]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:33.704 --> 01:32:36.305]  They are never going to stop.
[01:32:36.305 --> 01:32:40.386]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:32:40.386 --> 01:32:43.987]  Block free iPhone ads at Infowars.com.
[01:32:43.987 --> 01:32:47.307]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:32:47.307 --> 01:32:48.308]  Imperative.
[01:32:48.308 --> 01:32:50.308]  Destroy Britain's TV.
[01:32:50.308 --> 01:32:54.609]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:32:54.609 --> 01:32:56.390]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:57.250]  You can feel it.
[01:33:00.734 --> 01:33:05.768]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:33:09.468 --> 01:33:13.930]  From the front lines of the information war, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:33:13.930 --> 01:33:18.511]  And Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs did a great job from the front lines.
[01:33:18.511 --> 01:33:20.752]  You know why I hired Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson?
[01:33:20.752 --> 01:33:28.935]  Because both of them have courage, both of them have stood up for the First Amendment, and both of them I knew would make great team members at InfoWars.
[01:33:28.935 --> 01:33:33.237]  And we look down the road as we get more funding, hopefully, to hire five or six more reporters.
[01:33:34.873 --> 01:33:39.496]  More camera people, more video editors, more journalists, more researchers.
[01:33:39.496 --> 01:33:41.897]  That's what we're trying to build here.
[01:33:41.897 --> 01:33:46.459]  And we are simply promoting the basic ideas of freedom.
[01:33:46.459 --> 01:33:48.200]  I'm going to calls that disagree with me.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:53.023]  After we talk to James, Dave, Jason, Steve, Mac, and others, we'll keep taking calls.
[01:33:53.023 --> 01:33:54.223]  We've got open phones.
[01:33:54.223 --> 01:33:57.565]  We may end up having Jakari and Joe in studio towards the end.
[01:33:57.565 --> 01:34:00.867]  If their plane gets back on time, they get in studio.
[01:34:00.867 --> 01:34:02.088]  If they can get over here to the offices,
[01:34:03.231 --> 01:34:04.832]  All of that is coming up.
[01:34:04.832 --> 01:34:12.754]  I want to go to your calls, but first off, let's finish the video where Joe says, easy, ninja, to the guy with a mask on.
[01:34:12.754 --> 01:34:16.255]  And the other guy really gets in his face and says, go, go, go.
[01:34:16.255 --> 01:34:19.656]  And it said earlier, you know, I'll show you, terrorist.
[01:34:19.656 --> 01:34:25.278]  And it's just total thug behavior, total intimidation, garbage.
[01:34:25.278 --> 01:34:29.079]  And he didn't want to get in a fight with Joe and Jakari.
[01:34:29.966 --> 01:34:32.007]  I mean, you know, Joe's a little bit bigger than him.
[01:34:32.007 --> 01:34:33.087]  Jakari's a lot bigger.
[01:34:33.087 --> 01:34:36.488]  I mean, Jakari's in really good shape.
[01:34:36.488 --> 01:34:38.249]  And I just love Jakari's head.
[01:34:38.249 --> 01:34:39.369]  I'm not afraid of you.
[01:34:39.369 --> 01:34:41.090]  Those guys kind of start backing off.
[01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:48.252]  I couldn't see the video because Jakari was shooting it, but I think Jakari probably was getting ready to, you know, knock that guy upside the head if he did something.
[01:34:48.252 --> 01:34:52.113]  But just really good restraint.
[01:34:52.113 --> 01:34:53.453]  Really good restraint by the guys.
[01:34:53.453 --> 01:34:55.314]  And I told them, don't go into the crowds.
[01:34:55.314 --> 01:34:57.115]  They disregarded what I told them.
[01:34:57.115 --> 01:34:58.275]  But I mean, how do you get mad at them?
[01:34:59.329 --> 01:35:02.813]  The good news is, all's well that ends well, they got out of there.
[01:35:02.813 --> 01:35:04.596]  Now we're pulling them out as of last night.
[01:35:04.596 --> 01:35:11.884]  I said, just get back in the morning because, if they could get a flight, which they have, because now the feds have had what they wanted, the globalists that run the feds.
[01:35:11.884 --> 01:35:14.628]  They're spreading the protest all over the country.
[01:35:14.628 --> 01:35:16.390]  They're destabilizing things.
[01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:17.752]  They're getting what they wanted.
[01:35:18.737 --> 01:35:26.182]  More racial division, more police state, and a diversion for Obama with all of his executive orders and that agenda.
[01:35:26.182 --> 01:35:28.143]  And if you oppose Obama, you're racist.
[01:35:28.143 --> 01:35:29.344]  Let's go ahead and finish up the clip.
[01:35:43.206 --> 01:35:46.929]  As a black man, how do you feel about?
[01:36:11.625 --> 01:36:16.848]  That's how you respond to aggression!
[01:36:16.848 --> 01:36:18.629]  People are tired!
[01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:19.589]  I'm tired of it too!
[01:36:19.589 --> 01:36:21.330]  You ain't tired of it!
[01:36:21.330 --> 01:36:25.913]  Alex sent you out here to investigate and label black people trans!
[01:36:25.913 --> 01:36:30.395]  Tell Alex to come to the hood and holler at me!
[01:36:30.395 --> 01:36:34.337]  I checked him and his boys!
[01:36:34.337 --> 01:36:36.418]  I'll find them just like I found you!
[01:36:36.418 --> 01:36:39.340]  I'll find him just like I found you!
[01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:42.002]  I'm sure you will.
[01:36:42.002 --> 01:36:44.084]  If you ever do, you'll regret it.
[01:36:57.336 --> 01:36:58.577]  He said, I didn't break into the Bootsmobile store.
[01:36:58.577 --> 01:36:59.877]  I said, but that's what you're talking about.
[01:36:59.877 --> 01:37:02.439]  That's what you're out here justifying, people breaking into the Bootsmobile store.
[01:37:02.439 --> 01:37:03.099]  I didn't say you did it.
[01:37:03.099 --> 01:37:05.220]  I didn't say you burned down whatever building, but you ain't.
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:07.421]  But people aren't supposed to be out here burning down buildings.
[01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:09.242]  That's not going to bring back Mike Brown.
[01:37:09.242 --> 01:37:10.963]  That's not going to do anything to Darren Wilson.
[01:37:10.963 --> 01:37:12.384]  All it's doing is tearing down this community.
[01:37:12.384 --> 01:37:13.244]  That's all I said.
[01:37:13.244 --> 01:37:17.466]  This dude, whoever he is, just provided the tour, tried to tear me down, thought I was about to run from him.
[01:37:17.466 --> 01:37:18.647]  I didn't run from him.
[01:37:18.647 --> 01:37:21.468]  I said, he said, send your boy down here, and I'll tell him to talk to him.
[01:37:21.468 --> 01:37:23.149]  Rip off your mask, I'll tell him to come find you.
[01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:24.089]  I'll come find him.
[01:37:24.089 --> 01:37:25.050]  So, that's what happened.
[01:37:29.887 --> 01:37:34.669]  Anyways, do we have to be played like a fiddle by the globalists?
[01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:53.636]  I mean, just... I'll tell you, if black people started rioting and going after Planned Parenthood, if they read where Margaret Sanger said, we'll kill these weeds, we'll hire the Democratic Party to run them, you know, I would say, well, they know who the enemy is, and I'm not saying they should do that.
[01:37:53.636 --> 01:37:56.357]  But you've got 52% of black people killed.
[01:37:57.435 --> 01:38:15.243]  by the loving liberals that are really white supremacist and instead if I don't think shooting at that's what I said not even the burning but that that borders on it arson is obviously a form of terrorism but when you shoot at firefighters
[01:38:16.581 --> 01:38:17.981]  I mean, come on!
[01:38:17.981 --> 01:38:21.962]  And I didn't say... He said, all of you black people, he's saying you're terrorists.
[01:38:21.962 --> 01:38:26.703]  No, I said there are terrorists in there to delegitimize legitimate demonstrations.
[01:38:26.703 --> 01:38:31.004]  And when the police were shooting at the demonstrators for no reason months ago, we were against it.
[01:38:31.004 --> 01:38:31.944]  It's common sense.
[01:38:31.944 --> 01:38:34.265]  And people like that aren't being honest.
[01:38:34.265 --> 01:38:40.106]  He was lying to the crowd, misrepresenting, never letting Jokari talk.
[01:38:40.106 --> 01:38:42.626]  Very suspicious, is all I can say.
[01:38:42.626 --> 01:38:44.767]  He had talking points.
[01:38:44.767 --> 01:38:44.887]  And...
[01:38:46.505 --> 01:38:48.366]  It's just very sad.
[01:38:48.366 --> 01:38:51.328]  Let's go ahead now and go to the phone calls.
[01:38:51.328 --> 01:38:53.149]  See the full video unedited.
[01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:59.572]  The only editing in there is cutting out the cuss words.
[01:38:59.572 --> 01:39:00.993]  And there's no way to do it in a crowd like that.
[01:39:00.993 --> 01:39:06.176]  You can cut the clear ones out, but obviously back in the background there's a cacophony of stuff coming out.
[01:39:06.176 --> 01:39:10.498]  But let's go to Jason and Ferguson and Steve, Mac, Dave, James and others.
[01:39:10.498 --> 01:39:12.159]  Okay, you disagree on some points.
[01:39:12.159 --> 01:39:12.760]  Go ahead, Jason.
[01:39:14.122 --> 01:39:14.883]  Um, yes.
[01:39:14.883 --> 01:39:19.186]  First and foremost, I want to say that I have mad respect for Jakari.
[01:39:19.186 --> 01:39:20.707]  Always looked up to him.
[01:39:20.707 --> 01:39:22.549]  Glad you got him on your crew.
[01:39:22.549 --> 01:39:26.051]  But, I mean, I've lived in Ferguson for a while.
[01:39:26.051 --> 01:39:29.754]  I mean, I briefly just moved out before everything started happening.
[01:39:29.754 --> 01:39:33.497]  But, man, I've been harassed by Ferguson.
[01:39:33.497 --> 01:39:35.259]  I mean, they've towed my car!
[01:39:36.079 --> 01:39:38.440]  They've broken my windows.
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:45.661]  I went to protest at the courthouse and I've gotten followed by, intimidated by police.
[01:39:45.661 --> 01:39:54.463]  I mean, the reality here, Alex, the reason why people are so... Now, first and foremost, I do not condone any type of violence.
[01:39:54.463 --> 01:39:55.764]  No, no, no, no.
[01:39:55.764 --> 01:39:57.704]  And I'm in an inter-relationship.
[01:39:58.345 --> 01:40:06.399]  It's marriage right now, so it's pretty hard right now, living here, dealing with this because, I mean, we have to look at both sides.
[01:40:06.399 --> 01:40:11.487]  But the reality is, the reason why you see this is there is...
[01:40:12.757 --> 01:40:14.558]  Predatory police.
[01:40:14.558 --> 01:40:16.139]  They have no respect.
[01:40:16.139 --> 01:40:25.023]  Not all of them because I've been helped by Ferguson Police as well when my girlfriend was pregnant at the time and I was rushing to the hospital.
[01:40:25.023 --> 01:40:28.525]  One guy pulled me over but he escorted me to the hospital.
[01:40:28.525 --> 01:40:30.125]  But just for every good, there's like 10...
[01:40:31.406 --> 01:40:34.328]  Times more bad things are happening.
[01:40:34.328 --> 01:40:36.349]  Sir, but you're missing what I'm saying.
[01:40:36.349 --> 01:40:42.754]  Obviously, if the town is 70% black and there's, what, three police officers out of 50-something that are black?
[01:40:42.754 --> 01:40:45.035]  I mean, it should be at least half the folks should be black.
[01:40:45.035 --> 01:40:48.258]  The problem is they have trouble recruiting and the police departments admit that.
[01:40:48.258 --> 01:40:49.498]  Is there problems?
[01:40:49.498 --> 01:40:51.680]  Are the police being trained to be paramilitary?
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:55.663]  Did they shoot Joe Biggs with rubber bullets for no reason?
[01:40:55.663 --> 01:40:56.403]  Absolutely!
[01:40:58.004 --> 01:41:02.147]  So what we're getting at here is there's obviously something wrong in Ferguson.
[01:41:02.147 --> 01:41:14.694]  But then you can't give cover, I'm not saying you're doing this, but those demonstrating, to people shooting at the fire department because there might be some profiling and harassment going on.
[01:41:14.694 --> 01:41:20.498]  And yes, do they take because there's thug life stuff going on by a minority of people in the black community?
[01:41:20.498 --> 01:41:22.639]  Do they then project that on to all black people?
[01:41:22.639 --> 01:41:23.900]  Absolutely.
[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:25.641]  But I mean, I watch behavior.
[01:41:26.667 --> 01:41:32.230]  And if a black guy or a white guy is dressed nice, they get left alone by police.
[01:41:32.230 --> 01:41:37.312]  The few times I've been raggedy when I was younger and doing something, I've had the police pull over and harass me.
[01:41:37.312 --> 01:41:39.333]  And it makes you really mad.
[01:41:39.333 --> 01:41:44.016]  So I think even more than just driving while black, I think driving while poor.
[01:41:44.016 --> 01:41:48.218]  I think, you know, let me tell you, kids like to dress hip-hop.
[01:41:48.218 --> 01:41:50.999]  The police are trained, that means gang-related.
[01:41:50.999 --> 01:41:52.520]  So that's why MTV has this
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:42:01.613]  Hip-hop to prison pipeline is to get everybody in the uniform that the police, like attack dogs, have been trained to attack.
[01:42:01.613 --> 01:42:06.140]  So what I'm saying is, rise above it, see the larger PSYOP,
[01:42:07.242 --> 01:42:11.686]  Now the PSYOP is winning, training us all to fight with each other.
[01:42:11.686 --> 01:42:20.475]  This is a big victory for the Globalist, the Democratic Party and others that are helping stir up demonstrations nationwide that are not going to make these communities better.
[01:42:20.475 --> 01:42:23.477]  They are going to create more division, in my humble opinion.
[01:42:23.477 --> 01:42:23.778]  Go ahead.
[01:42:24.653 --> 01:42:29.277]  Yes, I want to say this, foremost, you know, like I said, I am not a racist.
[01:42:29.277 --> 01:42:32.680]  I love all my people, period.
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:41.108]  But I'm telling you, because of the issues of poor, not even, you're absolutely right, not a race thing, but driving while poor, period.
[01:42:41.468 --> 01:42:41.968]  Man up!
[01:43:02.995 --> 01:43:04.596]  You think that you're safe.
[01:43:04.596 --> 01:43:05.596]  You're not.
[01:43:05.596 --> 01:43:09.338]  These people, like me, I haven't done anything wrong.
[01:43:09.338 --> 01:43:10.158]  We're frustrated.
[01:43:10.158 --> 01:43:10.999]  We're tired.
[01:43:10.999 --> 01:43:12.279]  There is no outlet.
[01:43:12.279 --> 01:43:13.900]  There is nowhere to turn.
[01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:16.942]  And when you don't have any place to turn, where do you turn?
[01:43:16.942 --> 01:43:17.902]  You turn to the streets.
[01:43:17.902 --> 01:43:18.963]  You turn to your people.
[01:43:18.963 --> 01:43:21.024]  You turn to the... No, no, I hear you, but listen.
[01:43:21.024 --> 01:43:25.206]  Burning down... Who do you think burned down Mike Brown's church?
[01:43:25.206 --> 01:43:27.207]  Why attack a Mexican food restaurant?
[01:43:27.207 --> 01:43:29.288]  I mean, what does... What does...
[01:43:30.521 --> 01:43:34.224]  Attacking a lady at the pizza place, dude.
[01:43:34.224 --> 01:43:37.647]  Nothing but hurt to cause, absolutely.
[01:43:37.647 --> 01:43:40.869]  I'm not making excuses for these people, period.
[01:43:40.869 --> 01:43:41.970]  No, I know, I know.
[01:43:41.970 --> 01:43:50.697]  So, and I'm saying the cops should have helped the firefighters, and they should have stopped people shooting first and foremost, and then protected the demonstrators.
[01:43:51.437 --> 01:43:54.159]  I mean, listen, both sides are being manipulated.
[01:43:54.159 --> 01:43:55.880]  It's a total psy-op.
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:58.481]  And, you know, I'm sorry to hear what happened to you in Ferguson.
[01:43:58.481 --> 01:44:08.508]  We should get your name and number, maybe have you on the nightly news for five minutes, and get some other folks on to tell their experiences in Ferguson at the hands of the police.
[01:44:08.508 --> 01:44:10.309]  I appreciate your call.
[01:44:10.309 --> 01:44:16.933]  Listen, I grew up in Rockwall, Texas, where later the police and the sheriff got busted dealing drugs, just like I said they were.
[01:44:18.396 --> 01:44:27.082]  And they would pull us over and harass us and, you know, pull up at a bonfire and find somebody with a six-pack of beer and arrest them.
[01:44:27.082 --> 01:44:29.264]  And then we knew the cops were drug dealers.
[01:44:29.264 --> 01:44:35.249]  But we didn't do drugs, so they were drug dealers, you know, part of the time, but then also out writing tickets.
[01:44:35.249 --> 01:44:37.170]  And we're like, hey, you deal drugs.
[01:44:37.170 --> 01:44:40.092]  You can't write me a ticket.
[01:44:40.092 --> 01:44:40.813]  I get it.
[01:44:40.813 --> 01:44:42.274]  Corrupt police departments are a problem.
[01:44:43.188 --> 01:44:48.009]  But just running around making it a black-white thing is exactly what the system wants.
[01:44:48.009 --> 01:44:49.010]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[01:44:49.010 --> 01:44:54.151]  Look, I told you in July they're training for this and preparing and did emergency alerts.
[01:44:54.151 --> 01:45:01.413]  That's the point, is that Brown isn't the poster person, the poster child for this.
[01:45:01.413 --> 01:45:03.474]  They want an us-against-them mentality.
[01:45:03.474 --> 01:45:08.675]  They want the police seeing us all as the enemy so that they can turn them into an army against us.
[01:45:08.675 --> 01:45:10.576]  I don't want to play into the Civil War PSYOP.
[01:45:12.216 --> 01:45:13.517]  Dave in Oregon disagrees.
[01:45:13.517 --> 01:45:14.077]  You're on the air.
[01:45:14.077 --> 01:45:15.518]  Go ahead.
[01:45:15.518 --> 01:45:16.759]  Yeah, I got a couple points.
[01:45:16.759 --> 01:45:19.460]  First thing I'd like to say is First Amendment is gone.
[01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:30.607]  I recently got fired from a job and my boss was the Oregon Republican State Representative, Dallas Hurd, told me I didn't have free speech when I was running my mouth.
[01:45:30.607 --> 01:45:35.650]  And all I did is try to wake him up to the fact the New World Order fired the very next day.
[01:45:36.596 --> 01:45:41.142]  Oh yeah, you know, how dare you have free speech, how dare you tell your boss and Warren about something.
[01:45:41.142 --> 01:45:53.096]  They don't want to hear because they know the stuff's going on and they want to go along with the party line and they're going to end up losing everything in the Republican Party if they continue to sell out with the globalists.
[01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:58.230]  Yeah, fired me just for merely mentioning the New World Order.
[01:45:58.230 --> 01:46:09.772]  And I've been listening to you for a while, you woke us up to the fact that 9-11 is an inside job, Agenda 21 wants us dead, the Bohemian Grove exists, Build-A-Bird Group, all this stuff, but yeah, b-b-b-but don't do anything!
[01:46:09.772 --> 01:46:13.053]  That's how I feel from you lately, just, you just don't, don't do anything!
[01:46:13.053 --> 01:46:15.313]  You just sit there and let them kill us!
[01:46:15.313 --> 01:46:18.914]  It's self-defense, you talk about self-defense, what do you think's happening right now?
[01:46:18.914 --> 01:46:19.834]  I think it should lead to more.
[01:46:22.274 --> 01:46:26.615]  Uh, but not pizza places or Mexican food restaurants?
[01:46:26.615 --> 01:46:27.695]  Well, no.
[01:46:27.695 --> 01:46:32.216]  I think they should seriously turn their anger on to the ones that are causing this.
[01:46:32.216 --> 01:46:35.897]  You know, you know, let me tell you what really scared them.
[01:46:35.897 --> 01:46:43.438]  Seven, eight years ago, right before Obama got elected, the Tea Party was a Ron Paul libertarian movement, mad that he'd lost.
[01:46:43.438 --> 01:46:45.539]  My listeners, on record, Ron Paul said that on air.
[01:46:46.946 --> 01:46:51.070]  They went out and were confronting Republicans and Democrats and saying we're sick of it all.
[01:46:51.070 --> 01:46:52.931]  So the Republicans came in to try to co-opt it.
[01:46:52.931 --> 01:46:55.854]  They weren't successful overall.
[01:46:55.854 --> 01:47:01.518]  Then the media started calling it racist and all this to try to keep Democrats from joining it.
[01:47:01.518 --> 01:47:03.620]  Okay?
[01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:05.462]  And they used race again to divide things.
[01:47:07.210 --> 01:47:09.371]  That's what they're scared of.
[01:47:09.371 --> 01:47:15.594]  Can you imagine mobs going whenever a congressman comes to town to speak at a grocery store or speak at a church?
[01:47:15.594 --> 01:47:19.536]  Can you imagine going and demonstrating at their houses?
[01:47:19.536 --> 01:47:22.978]  Can you imagine getting aggressive, filing lawsuits?
[01:47:22.978 --> 01:47:25.399]  I mean, there's ways to really get them.
[01:47:25.399 --> 01:47:30.822]  The globalists advertise burning your own neighborhood down because it makes you look really stupid.
[01:47:31.850 --> 01:47:34.132]  And it makes businesses not move into your area.
[01:47:34.132 --> 01:47:35.793]  It is a way to impoverish you.
[01:47:35.793 --> 01:47:36.953]  It's a way to destroy you.
[01:47:36.953 --> 01:47:45.519]  They created the Great Society because blacks had more successful business districts than most white areas because blacks only shop with other blacks.
[01:47:45.519 --> 01:47:48.641]  They were smart.
[01:47:48.641 --> 01:47:49.802]  That's not how it works now.
[01:47:51.181 --> 01:47:56.727]  Now they burn out anybody that's in the area, including blacks, because if anybody's got a job, they're a sellout.
[01:47:56.727 --> 01:47:57.768]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:47:57.768 --> 01:48:02.613]  Just like that thug went up to Jakari and said, how dare you be a sellout for Alex Jones?
[01:48:02.613 --> 01:48:05.897]  I don't sit around and tell Jakari what to say or do.
[01:48:05.897 --> 01:48:07.638]  He's a smart guy, loves freedom.
[01:48:07.638 --> 01:48:11.523]  Kind of a libertarian, constitutionalist.
[01:48:11.523 --> 01:48:12.624]  Well-spoken, works hard.
[01:48:15.469 --> 01:48:17.950]  I mean, he's got a good job because he's a good guy.
[01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:18.931]  He's got talent.
[01:48:18.931 --> 01:48:22.612]  Why shouldn't he be part of an organization?
[01:48:22.612 --> 01:48:26.654]  Should he just flip hamburgers?
[01:48:26.654 --> 01:48:28.575]  He was looking to go into criminal justice.
[01:48:28.575 --> 01:48:35.058]  Maybe he should be a jail guard, you know, or he'll be a black guy behind the bars.
[01:48:35.058 --> 01:48:36.158]  I mean, think about that.
[01:48:36.158 --> 01:48:39.320]  Jakari isn't supposed to have a job.
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:43.022]  He doesn't have courage going out there and getting shot at and beat up and attacked.
[01:48:43.022 --> 01:48:43.802]  No, he does have courage.
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:58.178]  You just got some little thug nobody who just wants to complain about everything all day and threaten people and is mad if anybody else is successful.
[01:48:58.178 --> 01:48:59.060]  That's socialism.
[01:49:01.411 --> 01:49:04.572]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mac in South Carolina.
[01:49:04.572 --> 01:49:05.553]  You're on the... Oh, no, no.
[01:49:05.553 --> 01:49:06.153]  He's not up next.
[01:49:06.153 --> 01:49:06.373]  I'm sorry.
[01:49:06.373 --> 01:49:07.413]  We'll go to Mac in a minute.
[01:49:07.413 --> 01:49:09.674]  James in Missouri disagrees on coverage.
[01:49:09.674 --> 01:49:15.496]  He's listening on 102.9 FM KCXL, one of our oldest affiliates on AM.
[01:49:15.496 --> 01:49:17.317]  They also have FM the last few years.
[01:49:17.317 --> 01:49:23.680]  So 102.9 FM KCXL covering Kansas City.
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:24.340]  Great affiliate.
[01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:26.641]  We've been on there about 14 years.
[01:49:26.641 --> 01:49:28.061]  Great folks.
[01:49:28.061 --> 01:49:29.182]  James, thanks for calling in.
[01:49:29.182 --> 01:49:29.842]  What do you disagree with?
[01:49:30.814 --> 01:49:39.879]  Well, first, I just want to say I've been listening for about 10 years on this station, and I'm against people shooting at fire department.
[01:49:39.879 --> 01:49:41.780]  And I'm a peace and love type guy.
[01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:44.741]  I'm a big supporter of InfoWars and everything to do.
[01:49:44.741 --> 01:49:47.423]  I'm just saying, where is the coverage?
[01:49:47.423 --> 01:49:54.767]  Like, you said that you're mad and everybody's mad that the police didn't protect.
[01:49:54.767 --> 01:49:59.109]  But where is the people, the 2 million people of the surrounding
[01:49:59.884 --> 01:50:00.104]  St.
[01:50:00.104 --> 01:50:07.385]  Louis County area with some cojones down there with Kevlar and weapons protecting them.
[01:50:07.385 --> 01:50:09.626]  I mean, the public needs to organize.
[01:50:09.626 --> 01:50:11.246]  Where's the organization at?
[01:50:11.246 --> 01:50:12.486]  That's my angle.
[01:50:12.486 --> 01:50:16.187]  Listen, if I owned a Papa John's, I'm not boarding Jack's squad up.
[01:50:16.187 --> 01:50:17.927]  I'm going there with a shotgun.
[01:50:17.927 --> 01:50:19.448]  People walk up to burn it down or whatever.
[01:50:19.448 --> 01:50:24.709]  I'm going to walk out and I'm going to say, listen, you start trying to burn things down, I'm going to defend myself.
[01:50:24.709 --> 01:50:25.769]  You got five seconds.
[01:50:26.997 --> 01:50:29.259]  I mean, that's what the Second Amendment's for.
[01:50:29.259 --> 01:50:31.101]  Absolutely.
[01:50:31.101 --> 01:50:32.262]  Stay there, I'm gonna come back to you.
[01:50:32.262 --> 01:50:33.743]  I want you to be able to finish up, James.
[01:50:33.743 --> 01:50:38.267]  And then Steve, Mac, Johnny, James, Mac's next, but finish up, James.
[01:50:39.719 --> 01:50:40.920]  Steve disagrees in New Jersey.
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:42.601]  He thinks the riots are necessary.
[01:50:42.601 --> 01:50:43.222]  We'll get to you.
[01:50:43.222 --> 01:50:44.823]  We'll get to everybody.
[01:50:44.823 --> 01:50:46.584]  And I want to continue to hear from folks that disagree.
[01:50:46.584 --> 01:50:48.165]  I'm going to open the phones up for everybody.
[01:50:48.165 --> 01:50:49.466]  800-259-9231.
[01:50:49.466 --> 01:50:54.530]  I'll try to cycle through more of these a little bit quicker.

[01:52:03.279 --> 01:52:08.787]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[01:52:08.787 --> 01:52:11.091]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[01:52:11.091 --> 01:52:13.074]  I'm telling you to take cover!
[01:52:13.991 --> 01:52:18.275]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[01:52:18.275 --> 01:52:20.376]  Do you even have a plan B?
[01:52:20.376 --> 01:52:23.679]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[01:52:23.679 --> 01:52:24.900]  Children left with no homes.
[01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:26.762]  And no one's coming to help them.
[01:52:26.762 --> 01:52:29.664]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster is
[01:52:29.804 --> 01:52:30.224]  That's right.
[01:52:58.977 --> 01:53:01.438]  Don't take a cold or flu lying down.
[01:53:01.438 --> 01:53:04.499]  Stand up and fight back with Supernatural Silver.

[01:54:14.668 --> 01:54:14.809]  Ooh!
[01:54:29.746 --> 01:54:35.529]  This just broke at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:35.529 --> 01:54:37.230]  Obama just gave a speech.
[01:54:37.230 --> 01:54:39.772]  I just took an action to change the law.
[01:54:39.772 --> 01:54:42.934]  He's saying he doesn't need Congress to make the laws.
[01:54:42.934 --> 01:54:47.717]  Obama made the admission after getting heckled for several minutes by immigration protesters.
[01:54:48.919 --> 01:54:53.101]  But they're there to act like he's not doing enough to give him political cover.
[01:54:53.101 --> 01:55:04.646]  They're like, we want everything free, and everyone to come here, and everything, and pilgrims go home, and Obama's like, hey, I just took action to legalize y'all.
[01:55:04.646 --> 01:55:06.927]  We got that clip coming up.
[01:55:06.927 --> 01:55:08.548]  Briefly, then we're going back to your phone calls.
[01:55:09.946 --> 01:55:15.012]  We are giving back, but when you still purchase the products, you're giving back to help fund the whole operation.
[01:55:15.012 --> 01:55:17.876]  This is the biggest specials we've ever offered.
[01:55:17.876 --> 01:55:19.177]  A different special every day.
[01:55:19.177 --> 01:55:20.819]  Today's special...
[01:55:22.054 --> 01:55:28.896]  Is 20% off and free shipping of the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, super high quality.
[01:55:28.896 --> 01:55:32.097]  It's already the lowest price out there, the highest quality.
[01:55:32.097 --> 01:55:36.899]  We will have specials today, tomorrow, and Friday on key InfoWars live products, InfoWars gear.
[01:55:36.899 --> 01:55:41.001]  Starts today with the sold out Silver Bullet, now back in stock.
[01:55:41.001 --> 01:55:47.543]  And we can sell this limited amount for full price that we are giving back to listeners and slashing it 20% and giving free shipping.
[01:55:48.503 --> 01:55:50.104]  That's like a $6 value.
[01:55:50.104 --> 01:55:58.188]  Listers can now try InfoWars live products like Silver Bullets, just the free shipping is, to prepare for the most dangerous season of the year when it comes to health.

[01:56:16.175 --> 01:56:17.616]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:56:17.616 --> 01:56:19.798]  And let me expand on that.
[01:56:19.798 --> 01:56:21.961]  Let me expand on that.
[01:56:21.961 --> 01:56:25.344]  We sold out, like I told you, of the Vitamin B12 Secret 12.
[01:56:26.513 --> 01:56:27.874]  I mean, I wish we would have produced enough.
[01:56:27.874 --> 01:56:29.516]  It was the hottest seller ever.
[01:56:29.516 --> 01:56:31.177]  It's very proprietary, very special.
[01:56:31.177 --> 01:56:32.598]  That's why it's Secret 12.
[01:56:32.598 --> 01:56:33.959]  Maybe next year until we get more in.
[01:56:33.959 --> 01:56:37.182]  Probably could be like February, maybe, it looks like.
[01:56:37.182 --> 01:56:45.149]  So, believe me, when we say you need to move on something, we would sell out of the Silver Bullet in a couple days already.
[01:56:45.149 --> 01:56:47.211]  We're trying to get an emergency production on it.
[01:56:48.396 --> 01:56:50.098]  I thought it would be sold out by next week.
[01:56:50.098 --> 01:56:51.520]  This will sell out in a couple days.
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:55.204]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:55.204 --> 01:56:59.048]  And your purchase of these amazing supplements helps fund our operation.
[01:56:59.048 --> 01:57:05.435]  We just got more Molon Labe of the new design, 500 of them in, of the new belt buckles that fund the operation.
[01:57:05.435 --> 01:57:06.877]  And people say, what's that belt buckle mean?
[01:57:06.877 --> 01:57:07.798]  That's really cool.
[01:57:07.798 --> 01:57:09.120]  You can explain the Second Amendment to them.
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:13.342]  It's a great way to find friends and, you know, out there, like-minded folks.
[01:57:13.342 --> 01:57:16.484]  Wear your colors proud and loud, no matter what color you are.
[01:57:16.484 --> 01:57:20.666]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, madein1776.com.
[01:57:20.666 --> 01:57:23.307]  We've got a minute and a half to break.
[01:57:23.307 --> 01:57:27.650]  We'll finish up with James, then go to Mac, Steve, Johnny, James, and others.
[01:57:27.650 --> 01:57:30.071]  James in Missouri, listening on KCXL, 102.9 FM.
[01:57:30.071 --> 01:57:31.152]  Finish up your point.
[01:57:34.485 --> 01:57:44.454]  Yeah, I just want to say that, I mean, maybe it's past the point of no return, but we all need to organize and it has to start on a small family level.
[01:57:44.454 --> 01:57:51.721]  We need to get the families back and maybe some neighborhood watch and just go from there.
[01:57:51.721 --> 01:57:54.484]  Black, white, brown, yellow, it doesn't matter.
[01:57:54.484 --> 01:57:59.849]  We need to come together, but we got a lot of lot of resistance against us.
[01:58:00.168 --> 01:58:03.471]  Well, we're gonna try to get Stuart Rose of Oath Keepers on tonight.
[01:58:03.471 --> 01:58:08.355]  We'll probably get the article, copy their article, mirror it for InfoWars.com and PresidentPlata.com.
[01:58:08.355 --> 01:58:12.819]  But Oath Keepers is calling for Oath Keepers to go and protect the businesses.
[01:58:12.819 --> 01:58:14.360]  And, I mean, that's what it comes down to.
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:17.963]  Look, that's why this only happens in poor neighborhoods.
[01:58:17.963 --> 01:58:23.928]  Because the police stand down, and then the poor, desperate people are fed on by thugs that just want to rob stuff.
[01:58:23.928 --> 01:58:26.870]  And then they're so mad, they're like, yeah!
[01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:28.492]  And it's just so sad, the desperation.
[01:58:29.801 --> 01:58:31.802]  I'm surprised by how many folks out there.
[01:58:31.802 --> 01:58:35.143]  It's a minority of people, but there's white folks I know.
[01:58:35.143 --> 01:58:36.344]  They're like, go ahead and burn it.
[01:58:36.344 --> 01:58:37.544]  Yeah, the government's bad.
[01:58:37.544 --> 01:58:39.465]  People are that mad.
[01:58:39.465 --> 01:58:40.866]  Randomly shoot cops.
[01:58:40.866 --> 01:58:44.847]  I mean, you're going to walk up and see their face and shoot them?
[01:58:44.847 --> 01:58:46.388]  You get due process, folks.
[01:58:46.388 --> 01:58:48.309]  We don't want to start a civil war here.
[01:58:50.012 --> 01:58:56.997]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[02:00:05.939 --> 02:00:07.239]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.239 --> 02:00:09.000]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:10.761]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.761 --> 02:00:12.341]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.341 --> 02:00:13.721]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.721 --> 02:00:18.103]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.103 --> 02:00:22.944]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.944 --> 02:00:27.066]  Well, look what the cat dragged in!
[02:00:27.066 --> 02:00:30.627]  Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson were just in there in the control room.
[02:00:30.627 --> 02:00:32.587]  Joe says he's totally exhausted.
[02:00:32.587 --> 02:00:34.808]  We're gonna get him in here at the bottom of the hour and then, uh,
[02:00:36.181 --> 02:00:40.262]  Let them enjoy their Thanksgiving.
[02:00:40.262 --> 02:00:45.003]  You know, when I look at Joe or Jakari, I don't see a white guy and a black guy that are good buddies and like to work together.
[02:00:45.003 --> 02:00:46.923]  I just see two people that want freedom.
[02:00:46.923 --> 02:00:49.364]  I just see two great reporters.
[02:00:49.364 --> 02:00:56.105]  And when I look out there and I see Nico Acosta and, you know, our other folks out there like CJ and Richard, I don't see white guys or Hispanic guys.
[02:00:56.105 --> 02:00:58.326]  I just see people that do a great job.
[02:00:58.326 --> 02:01:00.566]  But I guess that's because I'm a racist.
[02:01:00.566 --> 02:01:03.067]  Anyways, the Democratic Party wants you to identify racially.
[02:01:03.988 --> 02:01:06.050]  And that's why they're stirring up stuff all over the country.
[02:01:06.050 --> 02:01:09.393]  Whether the Brown was shot for a good reason or not.
[02:01:09.393 --> 02:01:14.638]  And when a cop shoots somebody in the wrong, we go, yeah, a cop shot him in the wrong.
[02:01:14.638 --> 02:01:17.120]  The evidence isn't there.
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:18.422]  I like due process, folks.
[02:01:18.422 --> 02:01:20.884]  I've had people accuse me of a lot of stuff I didn't do.
[02:01:20.884 --> 02:01:21.725]  People lie.
[02:01:21.725 --> 02:01:26.770]  I mean, the cop may be a big jerk.
[02:01:27.688 --> 02:01:28.929]  There's a video they claim is him.
[02:01:28.929 --> 02:01:31.010]  It's a Ferguson cop.
[02:01:31.010 --> 02:01:33.312]  Threatening, you know, going, I'll basically crack you over the head.
[02:01:33.312 --> 02:01:35.373]  Because you're videotaping me.
[02:01:35.373 --> 02:01:38.335]  So maybe he is a little spoiled brat, coward, thug.
[02:01:38.335 --> 02:01:41.297]  I don't know.
[02:01:41.297 --> 02:01:45.860]  But... So maybe he's a little spoiled brat.
[02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:47.821]  And maybe Brown was a big, mean thug.
[02:01:47.821 --> 02:01:49.602]  That's what it looks like to me.
[02:01:49.602 --> 02:01:52.944]  Let's go to Steve.
[02:01:52.944 --> 02:01:53.765]  No, no, no.
[02:01:53.765 --> 02:01:54.505]  Max up first.
[02:01:54.505 --> 02:01:55.926]  Max, thanks for holding.
[02:01:55.926 --> 02:01:56.406]  You're on the air.
[02:01:56.406 --> 02:01:56.887]  Then Steve.
[02:01:58.369 --> 02:02:00.911]  Hey Alex, a big howdy to you from FEMA Region 4 here.
[02:02:00.911 --> 02:02:04.253]  I disagree with you a little bit on two points I've heard so far today.
[02:02:04.253 --> 02:02:18.584]  And the first, I'm really not trying to be legalistic, but the term terrorist being thrown around for these criminals in Ferguson, I think sets a dangerous precedent that's going to call for a lot of this military action on the streets and a lot more militarization of police.
[02:02:18.584 --> 02:02:23.188]  And who knows, the next president we get or something like that, it may be you and me out there, they're calling terrorists.
[02:02:23.368 --> 02:02:24.190]  No, no.
[02:02:24.190 --> 02:02:28.979]  Listen, I'm the guy that from day one said the Patriot Act will be used on non-terror related cases.
[02:02:28.979 --> 02:02:34.670]  It's going to define everything as terrorism to then use things outside of the legal system to come after you.
[02:02:35.856 --> 02:02:41.020]  But then when people, listen, it is the definition of terrorism to shoot at firefighters.
[02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:44.322]  That is meant to create fear and terrorize folks.
[02:02:44.322 --> 02:02:48.345]  So under that, they can be charged, but they don't need to be.
[02:02:48.345 --> 02:02:50.307]  They can be charged with attempted murder.
[02:02:50.307 --> 02:02:53.469]  So I get what you're saying, and I totally agree with you.
[02:02:55.290 --> 02:03:03.095]  Number two thing I disagree with, and on a little bit lighter note, I want to say happy Thanksgiving to you, and I'm not really sure that you're not Bill Hicks.
[02:03:03.095 --> 02:03:05.216]  Are you serious?
[02:03:05.216 --> 02:03:05.836]  No, I'm not.
[02:03:05.836 --> 02:03:10.099]  What do you think about Texas Monthly, like, doing a whole report on it?
[02:03:11.959 --> 02:03:12.419]  I don't know.
[02:03:12.419 --> 02:03:14.500]  I think it's good fodder out there, you know.
[02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:17.061]  It gets you a lot of listeners on YouTube and things like that.
[02:03:17.061 --> 02:03:18.962]  So I wouldn't, I wouldn't fight it too much.
[02:03:18.962 --> 02:03:24.443]  Well, I've already had like three or four times over the years, I'll be in a restaurant or at the grocery store and it's like, Bill!
[02:03:24.443 --> 02:03:25.224]  Bill!
[02:03:25.224 --> 02:03:26.204]  Bill!
[02:03:26.204 --> 02:03:27.564]  And I'm sitting there ignoring it.
[02:03:27.564 --> 02:03:29.025]  And because I mean, I'm not Bill.
[02:03:29.025 --> 02:03:30.605]  And then they go, Hey, Alex.
[02:03:30.605 --> 02:03:35.107]  And I turn around and they go, Oh, I've just seen you're Bill X. Besides, you're better looking than Bill anyway.
[02:03:35.766 --> 02:03:36.567]  Oh, I used to be.
[02:03:36.567 --> 02:03:37.329]  I don't know.
[02:03:37.329 --> 02:03:39.051]  Back when I was Bill Hicks.
[02:03:39.051 --> 02:03:41.535]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:03:41.535 --> 02:03:43.518]  He may have some Welsh genetics or something.
[02:03:43.518 --> 02:03:46.062]  If you ever go up to the Welsh country...
[02:03:47.173 --> 02:03:48.434]  Whales and stuff.
[02:03:48.434 --> 02:03:50.035]  I mean, everybody kind of looks like me.
[02:03:50.035 --> 02:03:52.876]  I think those are the dominant genes here.
[02:03:52.876 --> 02:03:56.578]  But I look about as Gaelic as it gets, folks.
[02:03:56.578 --> 02:03:59.080]  And they'll go, he's gay.
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:00.680]  You know, people are so ignorant.
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:03.822]  But I mean, I'm not Bill Hicks, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:03.822 --> 02:04:05.283]  He could look like a cousin, maybe.
[02:04:05.283 --> 02:04:07.644]  I mean, he had like dark brown hair.
[02:04:07.644 --> 02:04:09.545]  I got light brown hair now.
[02:04:09.545 --> 02:04:10.786]  He used to be blonde.
[02:04:10.786 --> 02:04:12.647]  I mean, it's just it's just insane.
[02:04:12.647 --> 02:04:14.868]  But, you know, they're just going to say now they've almost got me.
[02:04:14.868 --> 02:04:15.889]  They've almost exposed me.
[02:04:17.128 --> 02:04:29.311]  Yeah, well, you know, I really feel sorry for the folks up there getting their places burned down, and I just want, you know, the listeners out there just to be cautious about calling for more force.
[02:04:29.311 --> 02:04:33.292]  More force isn't necessarily the right thing in this situation.
[02:04:33.292 --> 02:04:37.393]  I think the criminals should be prosecuted in every instance that this goes on.
[02:04:38.394 --> 02:04:45.180]  But, you know, the cops up there, they're walking a tight line, you know, trying to get the criminals out and get this whole thing sorted out.
[02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:56.731]  I think eventually, it's definitely, we saw from the time they put this thing out at 9 p.m., the worst night of every drunken druggie who's just been getting worked up on that night, you know, and not holding it off.
[02:04:56.731 --> 02:04:57.632]  You can see the setup.
[02:04:57.632 --> 02:04:58.173]  I agree with you.
[02:04:58.173 --> 02:04:59.174]  They should have waited till the morning.
[02:05:00.458 --> 02:05:01.779]  The experts are clear.
[02:05:01.779 --> 02:05:08.885]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:05:08.885 --> 02:05:15.171]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:15.171 --> 02:05:18.754]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:05:18.894 --> 02:05:23.096]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:05:23.096 --> 02:05:28.419]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:05:28.419 --> 02:05:29.440]  Not our iodine.
[02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:33.242]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:05:33.242 --> 02:05:35.783]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.
[02:05:35.783 --> 02:05:37.824]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today.

[02:06:00.492 --> 02:06:04.154]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:06:04.154 --> 02:06:08.436]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:06:08.436 --> 02:06:10.196]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:06:10.196 --> 02:06:18.060]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:19.201]  But for how long?

[02:06:25.844 --> 02:06:28.665]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.

[02:07:00.049 --> 02:07:05.272]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:07:05.272 --> 02:07:11.596]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:07:11.596 --> 02:07:18.560]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:29.405]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[02:07:29.405 --> 02:07:35.569]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:07:35.569 --> 02:07:38.250]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[02:07:38.570 --> 02:07:40.751]  Hey, I'll show you politics in America.
[02:07:40.751 --> 02:07:41.571]  Here it is, right here.
[02:08:06.807 --> 02:08:09.509]  I think the puppet on the right shares my beliefs.
[02:08:09.509 --> 02:08:14.111]  I think the puppet on the left is more to my liking.
[02:08:14.111 --> 02:08:14.832]  Hey, wait a minute.
[02:08:14.832 --> 02:08:16.693]  There's one guy holding up both puppets.
[02:08:16.693 --> 02:08:17.913]  Shut up!
[02:08:17.913 --> 02:08:19.354]  Go back to bed, America.
[02:08:19.354 --> 02:08:22.916]  Your government is in control.
[02:08:22.916 --> 02:08:27.779]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and elastic.
[02:08:27.779 --> 02:08:29.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:31.864 --> 02:08:38.128]  Oh man, we've got all this serious stuff to deal with, and a caller just brought this up.
[02:08:38.128 --> 02:08:43.372]  It's in the magazine, one of the biggest in the country, Texas Monthly, it's huge.
[02:08:43.372 --> 02:08:57.621]  Most Texans, a lot of Texans subscribe to it, and the headline is, the conspiracy theory that Alex Jones is actually legendary, long-dead Texas comedian Bill Hicks, and they tongue-in-cheek look at it like it could be true.
[02:08:57.621 --> 02:09:01.344]  We can scroll through it for TV viewers.
[02:09:03.831 --> 02:09:06.592]  We're going to post the article up on Infowars.com.
[02:09:06.592 --> 02:09:16.614]  This has been going on five, six years and I know it annoys the family because their son's dead and it's pretty painful to have this brought up.
[02:09:16.614 --> 02:09:18.995]  And it's just, it's just crazy.
[02:09:18.995 --> 02:09:20.636]  It's totally crazy.
[02:09:20.636 --> 02:09:24.657]  And it shows how people can latch on to something that's a real conspiracy theory.
[02:09:24.657 --> 02:09:29.458]  And then meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is not federal.
[02:09:30.535 --> 02:09:38.917]  And it's raping the country, sucking us dry, foreign banks are looting us, they're shutting down our industrial base.
[02:09:38.917 --> 02:09:47.818]  Half the blacks get aborted in the country, but they're not rioting about that, which they should be, in my humble view, but over some guy that appears to be a thug.
[02:09:47.818 --> 02:09:54.819]  People like Stalin said, evil genius that he was, one man is a martyr.
[02:09:54.819 --> 02:09:57.820]  One man's death is a tragedy.
[02:10:00.260 --> 02:10:03.401]  10 million people's deaths is a statistic, basically.
[02:10:03.401 --> 02:10:11.803]  And it's just, you can have something that is so asinine, that is just viral on the internet, that I'm Bill Hicks.
[02:10:11.803 --> 02:10:17.544]  It's like the white supremacists, with all this made-up stuff about me, lying about me constantly.
[02:10:17.544 --> 02:10:19.824]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:10:19.824 --> 02:10:22.225]  And by the way, if you knew how the web worked, idiots,
[02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:26.461]  It doesn't hurt me that you're doing all that.
[02:10:26.461 --> 02:10:37.124]  In this world of billions of websites and hundreds of millions of people posting every few minutes, all of your negative attacks only create more buzz.
[02:10:37.124 --> 02:10:37.944]  People say, who is this?
[02:10:37.944 --> 02:10:39.124]  I better check this out.
[02:10:39.124 --> 02:10:41.525]  So they come here to hear what we actually stand for.
[02:10:41.525 --> 02:10:47.527]  Not racism against blacks, racism against Asians, Jews, whites, Christians.
[02:10:47.527 --> 02:10:48.707]  I just want freedom.
[02:10:48.707 --> 02:10:52.408]  I'm not Islamophobic, but I don't support our government funding radical Islamicists.
[02:10:53.695 --> 02:10:58.480]  And then I get attacked by some of the radical Islamists that I'm anti-Arab or anti-Islam.
[02:10:58.480 --> 02:10:59.981]  I'm just anti-tyranny.
[02:10:59.981 --> 02:11:03.164]  And it can come in any shape, form, or group.
[02:11:03.164 --> 02:11:05.266]  Now that's where I stand.
[02:11:05.266 --> 02:11:08.689]  We told you they're preparing for riots of blacks at the Pentagon training.
[02:11:08.689 --> 02:11:14.555]  We show the videos, we show the documents in July in the articles that are up on Infowars.com.
[02:11:14.555 --> 02:11:17.618]  Flashback US Army training to fight black Americans.
[02:11:20.134 --> 02:11:20.634]  Bill, how's it going?
[02:11:20.634 --> 02:11:21.935]  I just want to say a couple things.
[02:11:47.822 --> 02:11:51.503]  The American people are tired of this tyranny, and it's not Michael Brown.
[02:11:51.503 --> 02:11:55.924]  There's countless other, you know, police brutality.
[02:11:55.924 --> 02:11:58.485]  That black man who was strangled to death by the cops.
[02:11:58.485 --> 02:12:03.566]  I mean, the American people are sick of it, and this is the way they're going to show how sick and tired it is.
[02:12:03.566 --> 02:12:08.287]  And would you call the Patriots, back when they dumped the King Harbor, would you call them terrorists?
[02:12:09.986 --> 02:12:27.914]  They were attacking the direct company East India that had gotten the regulation passed outside of law to not let them import tea, and they had ships commanding British naval forces protecting them, seizing their legitimate cargoes being brought into Boston.
[02:12:27.914 --> 02:12:35.878]  And so what they did was a strategic, beautiful blow directly at the enemy, and I support
[02:12:36.718 --> 02:12:39.980]  The men that met at the Green Dragon and carried out that tea party.
[02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:41.642]  That is exactly what I explained.
[02:12:41.642 --> 02:12:44.023]  Do people even listen to what I'm saying?
[02:12:44.023 --> 02:12:57.793]  I said, if blacks got mad at Planned Parenthood, founded to murder them, founded to exterminate their children, founded to carry out eugenics in their neighborhoods, I would say, well, you're really going after the folks that are running the show.
[02:12:57.793 --> 02:13:02.557]  Instead, oh, they love them, because the Democrats tell them to, on average.
[02:13:02.557 --> 02:13:03.257]  Same deal.
[02:13:04.698 --> 02:13:16.783]  If people who had their kids die from Factor VIII and Bayer, and there wasn't justice in that, and I'm not saying do this, but I would say, well, you know, they hurt people and they weren't brought to justice.
[02:13:16.783 --> 02:13:20.204]  But I wouldn't want to see a secretary at Bayer.
[02:13:20.204 --> 02:13:30.528]  How about whoever was in charge at the time who made that decision in those audio recordings and texts that came out in court that they said, so what if it's going to kill people?
[02:13:30.528 --> 02:13:31.028]  Ship it out.
[02:13:32.079 --> 02:13:34.079]  Those people need to be held accountable.
[02:13:34.079 --> 02:13:35.980]  You bet.
[02:13:35.980 --> 02:13:36.840]  You bet.
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:38.380]  But I look at the bigger issue.
[02:13:38.380 --> 02:13:45.622]  The globalists want to get a physical war going now before we peacefully hit critical mass and awaken the country to the globalist agenda.
[02:13:45.622 --> 02:13:46.542]  That's happening.
[02:13:46.542 --> 02:13:54.344]  So I said they would start a race war to trigger the rebellion that's coming to make it racial in nature so we're not unified.
[02:13:54.344 --> 02:13:57.045]  They hijack waves of discontent.
[02:13:57.887 --> 02:14:02.892]  Julius Caesar said, there is a time in the affairs of men when taking up the flood leads on to fortune.
[02:14:02.892 --> 02:14:16.365]  An oft-quoted statement here on the broadcast, it's actually William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, but he was quoting known historical statements of Julius Caesar, that you've got to catch fortune at the tide.
[02:14:16.365 --> 02:14:19.148]  There is a tide in the affairs of men when taking up the flood leads on to fortune.
[02:14:20.285 --> 02:14:23.027]  The globalists know that there is a tide of anger.
[02:14:23.027 --> 02:14:24.588]  People are trying to find answers.
[02:14:24.588 --> 02:14:32.213]  They want to sabotage it, make it racial, get us fighting with the police so they can call the military out, just like Katrina to take the guns.
[02:14:32.213 --> 02:14:34.135]  Do you understand the psyop?
[02:14:34.135 --> 02:14:36.336]  Do you admit that I predicted all this?
[02:14:36.336 --> 02:14:38.618]  Do you admit we told you what was coming next?
[02:14:38.618 --> 02:14:40.999]  Do we get any respect for being right?
[02:14:40.999 --> 02:14:44.622]  Or what are you saying?
[02:14:44.622 --> 02:14:47.664]  I agree with some of the points you're making, but at the same time,
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:55.725]  Yeah, but two wrongs don't make a right, and this will cause more militarization of police, because now they can show them being shot at, and the armored vehicles protecting them.
[02:14:55.725 --> 02:14:56.726]  Let's expand on that.
[02:14:56.726 --> 02:14:58.127]  Let's expand on that.
[02:14:58.127 --> 02:14:58.567]  If police
[02:15:18.536 --> 02:15:21.698]  Like at Lexington and Concord, start firing first.
[02:15:21.698 --> 02:15:24.619]  It's called the Shot Heard Round the World.
[02:15:24.619 --> 02:15:30.042]  So at Waco, the feds are all on video and Waco Rules of Engagement, their own videos that came out in trial.
[02:15:30.042 --> 02:15:31.122]  We're going to get more funding.
[02:15:31.122 --> 02:15:32.723]  It's going to be fun taking out these kooks.
[02:15:33.988 --> 02:15:36.469]  They could have picked up David Koresh anytime in town.
[02:15:36.469 --> 02:15:38.250]  They said all these lies and exaggerations.
[02:15:38.250 --> 02:15:43.091]  I didn't like David Koresh, by the way, studying it, but they didn't deserve to kill those babies, is my point.
[02:15:43.091 --> 02:15:51.955]  They went out there to start their war against the American people, kicking it off against a good target, a bunch of religious weirdos, in their view, hanging out in some compound.
[02:15:51.955 --> 02:15:55.096]  They pull up, they open fire on record.
[02:15:55.096 --> 02:16:00.438]  The Davidians fired back against people trying to kill them, and under common law, that was their right.
[02:16:00.438 --> 02:16:02.879]  So then they sent in the Delta Force to murder everybody.
[02:16:03.541 --> 02:16:06.402]  And that's shameful.
[02:16:06.402 --> 02:16:08.562]  1993, Day 51.
[02:16:08.562 --> 02:16:20.366]  If you had a building full of black people, and they were shot at first, and they shot back, I would say, even if I didn't agree with whatever weird group they were part of, that they were in the right.
[02:16:20.366 --> 02:16:25.387]  That's why I stood up for the Davidians, and have and know them well.
[02:16:25.387 --> 02:16:27.268]  So, again, you don't...
[02:16:28.547 --> 02:16:35.153]  Because there's a suspicious shooting by a cop, you don't say, hey, we're going to get your family or we're going to kill other cops in the department.
[02:16:35.153 --> 02:16:37.575]  That's not how it works.
[02:16:37.575 --> 02:16:39.297]  Anything else?
[02:16:39.297 --> 02:16:49.166]  Yeah, I just I just want to say, like, back when Michael Brown was shot, the protests and riots that followed, they exposed the military, the police, even the Obama administration said we need to look at this.
[02:16:50.623 --> 02:16:54.645]  Even the Obama administration who made sure they got the armored vehicles.
[02:16:54.645 --> 02:16:58.608]  They had bizarre training with them two years before in Ferguson and surrounding areas.
[02:16:58.608 --> 02:17:00.189]  They were gauging the crowd.
[02:17:00.189 --> 02:17:03.951]  They have computer models of who they think is going to have an uprising.
[02:17:03.951 --> 02:17:05.652]  This is a psy-op, sir.
[02:17:05.652 --> 02:17:09.334]  I understand it's a psy-op, but let's give it to them.
[02:17:09.334 --> 02:17:11.936]  Let's give it to them in order to let them know it's coming.
[02:17:14.813 --> 02:17:23.676]  If the rebels would have fired first at Lexington or Concord, we might not have had the moral high ground and lost the Revolutionary War.
[02:17:23.676 --> 02:17:31.238]  Do you understand, and I love people out there that have, I see it on the internet, Alex Jones says, take punishment, take abuse.
[02:17:31.238 --> 02:17:33.138]  That's what Christ did, that's what Gandhi did.
[02:17:33.138 --> 02:17:38.100]  At key points, it destroys the enemy when they are clearly the villain.
[02:17:38.888 --> 02:17:41.670]  It's like Obi-Wan Kenobi lets Darth Vader cut him in half.
[02:17:41.670 --> 02:17:42.871]  Why does he do that?
[02:17:42.871 --> 02:17:48.474]  Because he wants to inspire that next group.
[02:17:48.474 --> 02:17:51.156]  People just don't understand how the world really works.
[02:17:51.156 --> 02:17:52.297]  Look at Martin Luther King.
[02:17:52.297 --> 02:17:55.819]  He's a much greater man because he was non-violent and was killed.
[02:17:55.819 --> 02:17:56.320]  Malcolm X!
[02:17:57.455 --> 02:18:01.499]  Started preaching non-violence so they killed him, hoping for uprisings.
[02:18:01.499 --> 02:18:03.460]  They want the uprisings.
[02:18:03.460 --> 02:18:06.943]  It's in PSYOP manuals that are declassified!
[02:18:06.943 --> 02:18:09.005]  I'm an expert on this!
[02:18:09.005 --> 02:18:11.527]  But you don't even have to be an expert, you can go become one!
[02:18:11.527 --> 02:18:14.190]  I appreciate your call, Steve.
[02:18:14.190 --> 02:18:22.097]  I know everybody's mad, but when the Civil War starts and you don't have gasoline or heating, and Obama becomes a dictator, they win.
[02:18:24.534 --> 02:18:27.435]  And then you're gonna celebrate 300,000 dead cops?
[02:18:27.435 --> 02:18:30.215]  That doesn't do anything to the globalists!
[02:18:30.215 --> 02:18:34.336]  That war criminal Soros will still be running around!
[02:18:34.336 --> 02:18:36.116]  Johnny in California, go ahead.
[02:18:55.063 --> 02:19:02.628]  I mean, look, if peace is the answer, then why don't we give up our guns now and just everybody lay down and let the next generation see our legacy?
[02:19:02.628 --> 02:19:03.468]  That's not the answer.
[02:19:03.468 --> 02:19:04.449]  That's not the answer.
[02:19:04.449 --> 02:19:05.370]  We get more guns.
[02:19:05.370 --> 02:19:06.530]  We get more ready.
[02:19:06.530 --> 02:19:07.491]  We educate people.
[02:19:07.491 --> 02:19:09.472]  We reach out to the police and military.
[02:19:09.472 --> 02:19:10.273]  We wake them up.
[02:19:10.273 --> 02:19:13.295]  We don't let us be played off against each other.
[02:19:15.979 --> 02:19:18.623]  So, we need to fight now.
[02:19:18.623 --> 02:19:19.404]  This is the time.
[02:19:19.404 --> 02:19:21.747]  Everybody's already organizing now.
[02:19:21.747 --> 02:19:23.970]  Everybody's ready to go now.
[02:19:23.970 --> 02:19:26.353]  Why aren't you calling for... Right, right, Wynn.
[02:19:26.353 --> 02:19:27.755]  I'm gonna come back to you after break.
[02:19:27.755 --> 02:19:28.416]  This is so important.
[02:19:28.416 --> 02:19:30.259]  Don't hang up, Johnny.
[02:19:30.259 --> 02:19:31.100]  Folks, this is incredible.
[02:19:33.371 --> 02:19:36.053]  They picked a case where the guy was a thug.
[02:19:36.053 --> 02:19:39.175]  They picked a case where the system has the moral high ground.
[02:19:39.175 --> 02:19:41.816]  They picked a fake Lexington Concord.
[02:19:41.816 --> 02:19:43.958]  They picked Ferguson as a psyop.
[02:19:43.958 --> 02:19:52.023]  You notice the feds stood down and backed off in the Bundy Ranch because it didn't look right a bunch of cowboys riding up against guys threatening to shoot them.
[02:19:52.023 --> 02:19:55.525]  They backed off there because it wasn't where they could win.
[02:19:55.525 --> 02:19:57.566]  This is a rigged deal.
[02:19:57.566 --> 02:19:58.787]  Stay there, I'm going to come back and explain.
[02:20:00.069 --> 02:20:05.191]  Do you have relatives and friends that are convinced there's no need ever to prepare for any kind of emergency?
[02:20:05.191 --> 02:20:08.192]  Are these also folks you buy Christmas presents for?

[02:22:56.092 --> 02:22:57.193]  The big sale is on!
[02:22:57.193 --> 02:22:57.834]  I'll see you there!
[02:22:58.354 --> 02:23:02.519]  There may be a hidden danger lurking in our homes and surroundings.
[02:23:02.519 --> 02:23:05.302]  Without the right equipment, you'll never know it's there.
[02:23:05.302 --> 02:23:13.031]  Natural and man-made nuclear radiation can find its way into our living environment, and maser instruments are your best line of defense.
[02:23:13.411 --> 02:23:22.479]  Unlike lower-cost products, Maser Instruments detects all forms of nuclear radiation, including alpha, beta, gamma, and x-rays.
[02:23:22.479 --> 02:23:28.284]  Most products require you manually turn them on for each use, but Maser Instruments are different.
[02:23:28.664 --> 02:23:30.866]  They're designed to be always on.
[02:23:30.866 --> 02:23:32.287]  Just like your smoke alarm.
[02:23:32.287 --> 02:23:35.869]  Detecting, measuring, and monitoring nuclear radiation.
[02:23:35.869 --> 02:23:36.950]  Made in America.
[02:23:36.950 --> 02:23:42.914]  Maser Instruments are laboratory-grade, EMP-resistant, and powered by common 9-volt batteries.
[02:23:42.914 --> 02:23:45.816]  Get the details at MaserInstruments.com.
[02:23:45.816 --> 02:23:49.198]  Spelled M-A-C-U-R, Instruments.com.
[02:23:49.198 --> 02:23:53.701]  If you can't reliably measure nuclear radiation, you're not fully prepared.
[02:23:53.701 --> 02:23:56.823]  But now you can be, at MaserInstruments.com.
[02:24:00.980 --> 02:24:06.803]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:06.803 --> 02:24:09.704]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:24:09.704 --> 02:24:13.225]  A lot of people see this as a referendum.
[02:24:13.225 --> 02:24:15.366]  A police being above the law.
[02:24:15.366 --> 02:24:18.987]  So hey, let's go out and riot, that'll show them.
[02:24:18.987 --> 02:24:23.449]  No, that only bolsters the worst elements of the system that wants to control the police.
[02:24:23.449 --> 02:24:26.290]  I mean, I look at the board, it says
[02:24:27.791 --> 02:24:29.512]  Uh, Johnny in California disagrees.
[02:24:29.512 --> 02:24:30.593]  Who was it I was just talking to?
[02:24:30.593 --> 02:24:31.554]  I want him to finish their statement.
[02:24:31.554 --> 02:24:33.355]  I'm gonna go back to Johnny.
[02:24:33.355 --> 02:24:34.756]  James disagrees.
[02:24:34.756 --> 02:24:36.357]  Says Alex is being racist.
[02:24:36.357 --> 02:24:38.198]  I'm going to him next.
[02:24:38.198 --> 02:24:43.702]  Uh, then Bob in Montana, Richard in Ohio, Victor in California.
[02:24:43.702 --> 02:24:48.705]  I wanted people to hear the mentality, though, of folks that are angry.
[02:24:48.705 --> 02:24:56.290]  They sound like they're legitimately upset, but at the same time they just don't have logic, in my view.
[02:24:58.533 --> 02:25:08.880]  That attacking Papa John's, you know, a white lady who makes $12 an hour, I mean, does she deserve to be physically punched and attacked?
[02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:11.222]  Because she has a $12 an hour job?
[02:25:11.222 --> 02:25:14.684]  Or other cops standing there, do they need to be shot at?
[02:25:14.684 --> 02:25:17.466]  See, they want to get us killing each other.
[02:25:17.466 --> 02:25:18.427]  It's so elementary.
[02:25:18.427 --> 02:25:23.951]  In fact, queue up for the next segment of the James Bond clip from Russia with Love about the Siamese fighting fish.
[02:25:23.951 --> 02:25:26.133]  I'm going to try to explain this to people again.
[02:25:26.133 --> 02:25:27.754]  I know our general audience understands it.
[02:25:28.792 --> 02:25:35.854]  But the police actually were brainwashed that there was no new world order, no foreign takeover, no police state coming.
[02:25:35.854 --> 02:25:37.655]  They now see it happening.
[02:25:37.655 --> 02:25:42.136]  They now are the easiest people next to the military to wake up.
[02:25:42.136 --> 02:25:43.917]  That's got the globalists worried.
[02:25:43.917 --> 02:25:49.939]  So they want to turn us against the police and military, so that when Obama comes in with dictatorial decrees, which are already happening,
[02:25:52.133 --> 02:25:54.155]  Maybe even becoming dictator.
[02:25:54.155 --> 02:26:03.226]  They can have their Democratic Party operatives stir up the inner cities, have folks attack the police so they'll go under federal control begging for troops to come in.
[02:26:03.226 --> 02:26:10.574]  Then Obama, who's playing the part of the savior to his own rioters, can roll in as the savior.
[02:26:12.762 --> 02:26:14.283]  It's called a Hegelian dialectic.
[02:26:14.283 --> 02:26:16.685]  It's very sophisticated, PSYOPs.
[02:26:16.685 --> 02:26:19.227]  It's very simple at one level, but very sophisticated at another.
[02:26:19.227 --> 02:26:23.550]  And I understand a lot of police are corrupt and above the law.
[02:26:23.550 --> 02:26:24.851]  People are angry about it.
[02:26:24.851 --> 02:26:27.373]  I've made four police state films.
[02:26:27.373 --> 02:26:29.855]  But I saw this coming a thousand miles away.
[02:26:29.855 --> 02:26:31.896]  It's now happening.
[02:26:31.896 --> 02:26:33.998]  And it's bad for everybody but the globalists.
[02:26:35.216 --> 02:26:38.558]  I don't care how much money you make, where you live, what color you are.
[02:26:38.558 --> 02:26:39.519]  This is bad.
[02:26:39.519 --> 02:26:41.200]  You're obviously listeners.
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:43.161]  Have you been listening is what I'm asking you.
[02:26:43.161 --> 02:26:47.404]  Can you want to go watch the July report I did, warning of all this unfolding?
[02:26:47.404 --> 02:26:51.006]  I can see what's next, what I would play if I was them.
[02:26:51.006 --> 02:26:53.208]  I study this.
[02:26:53.208 --> 02:26:54.268]  I'm not bragging.
[02:26:54.268 --> 02:26:56.450]  I know what I'm talking about.
[02:26:56.450 --> 02:26:57.951]  How many times do I have to be right?
[02:26:59.659 --> 02:27:04.884]  If all this kicks off into a real civil war, we're trying to stop it right now, I'm just keeping my head down, okay?
[02:27:04.884 --> 02:27:06.766]  I'm not going to be in the middle of this.
[02:27:06.766 --> 02:27:09.848]  This is all meant to bring in tyrannies that can come arrest me, I'm telling you.
[02:27:09.848 --> 02:27:13.572]  And go after Ron Paul and the real opposition of the globalists.
[02:27:13.572 --> 02:27:14.333]  You understand that?
[02:27:14.333 --> 02:27:20.718]  They want to twist things so they can bring in so much tyranny, they can go after the real opposition.
[02:27:20.718 --> 02:27:23.121]  State governors and people like that that want to stop this.
[02:27:24.687 --> 02:27:28.530]  The Liberty Movement has people everywhere, and the globalists know it and are scared.
[02:27:28.530 --> 02:27:30.451]  We're very close to taking the country back.
[02:27:30.451 --> 02:27:31.512]  Does that mean it'll be perfect?
[02:27:31.512 --> 02:27:38.176]  No, but we're close to getting groups of people in office that don't want to destroy the country, and that's a big improvement.
[02:27:38.176 --> 02:27:39.597]  I just got chills.
[02:27:39.597 --> 02:27:41.359]  I don't think I'm going to be able to stop it, though.
[02:27:41.359 --> 02:27:43.320]  God Almighty.
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:44.521]  Go ahead, Johnny, and finish up.
[02:27:46.249 --> 02:27:50.531]  Alex, then why are we not promoting for these people in these neighborhoods?
[02:27:50.531 --> 02:27:53.792]  Yeah, not to burn down these buildings and businesses.
[02:27:53.792 --> 02:27:56.913]  Go out there, bear arms, and stand right in front of the police station.
[02:27:56.913 --> 02:27:57.694]  Have arms.
[02:27:57.694 --> 02:28:02.135]  Everybody bear arms in the town and exercise their right.
[02:28:02.135 --> 02:28:07.737]  Just like they did in... Why don't we have a high-news situation?
[02:28:07.737 --> 02:28:09.038]  You're not promoting that?
[02:28:09.038 --> 02:28:09.998]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:28:09.998 --> 02:28:12.259]  I don't think the Ferguson police are the Redcoats.
[02:28:14.117 --> 02:28:17.299]  I mean, okay, well, such a big complex world now.
[02:28:17.299 --> 02:28:22.881]  I mean, what does... I mean, who would you target?
[02:28:22.881 --> 02:28:24.862]  This country is founded on racism.
[02:28:24.862 --> 02:28:27.704]  Look at what we're celebrating tomorrow.
[02:28:27.704 --> 02:28:28.464]  Thanksgiving.
[02:28:28.464 --> 02:28:31.185]  Oh, thanks to the natives for your land that we stole.
[02:28:31.185 --> 02:28:32.786]  I mean, come on, Alex.
[02:28:32.786 --> 02:28:34.967]  This country has been founded on racism.
[02:28:34.967 --> 02:28:38.168]  Sir, sir, sir, that's all really one-dimensional.
[02:28:38.168 --> 02:28:41.090]  I mean, on both sides of my family.
[02:28:41.790 --> 02:28:43.551]  Had family on the Mayflower.
[02:28:43.551 --> 02:28:47.593]  They were religious Protestants that wanted freedom and were looking for something.
[02:28:47.593 --> 02:28:54.016]  The Indians were constantly, the Natives were constantly killing each other, trying to team up with different groups, just like whites were doing in Europe.
[02:28:54.016 --> 02:28:55.477]  Same behavior.
[02:28:55.477 --> 02:28:57.798]  So, I don't lionize the Europeans.
[02:28:57.798 --> 02:29:09.124]  I don't lionize the Natives and Squanto and the whole Nine Yards and most of the, you know, they had a bunch of expeditions, Jamestown, you name it, that failed where everybody died or got eaten.
[02:29:09.824 --> 02:29:12.245]  Then why don't we celebrate something?
[02:29:31.850 --> 02:29:34.431]  Uh, Big Dinner on September 11th.
[02:29:34.431 --> 02:29:37.032]  Because the Americans were killing each other as well.
[02:29:37.032 --> 02:29:39.373]  The Americans are killing everyone all over the world.
[02:29:39.373 --> 02:29:39.894]  I hear ya.
[02:29:39.894 --> 02:29:43.075]  That's globalists controlling us because we're powerful.
[02:29:43.075 --> 02:29:46.317]  Oh man, it's, it's, listen.
[02:29:46.317 --> 02:29:47.137]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:47.137 --> 02:29:47.657]  Stay with us.
[02:29:47.657 --> 02:29:48.217]  More calls.
[02:29:48.217 --> 02:29:49.238]  We got the crew coming in.
[02:29:49.238 --> 02:29:49.998]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.998 --> 02:29:50.719]  Back from combat.
[02:29:50.719 --> 02:29:53.060]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.060 --> 02:29:54.780]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:54.780 --> 02:29:56.121]  Now we've been on the march.
[02:29:56.121 --> 02:29:57.682]  Right now the empire's on the march though.
[02:30:00.137 --> 02:30:09.783]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[02:30:09.783 --> 02:30:19.728]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:30:19.728 --> 02:30:22.650]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[02:30:22.850 --> 02:30:23.070]  I think?
[02:30:45.427 --> 02:30:50.750]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:56.234]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with OxyPowder.
[02:30:56.234 --> 02:30:57.254]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:30:57.254 --> 02:31:02.218]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:31:02.218 --> 02:31:05.880]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:06.740 --> 02:31:11.183]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:31:11.183 --> 02:31:18.506]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:31:18.506 --> 02:31:27.571]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:27.791 --> 02:31:33.333]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[02:31:33.333 --> 02:31:40.937]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[02:31:40.937 --> 02:31:43.498]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:32:00.549 --> 02:32:07.194]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:32:07.194 --> 02:32:12.338]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:32:12.338 --> 02:32:14.200]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[02:32:16.411 --> 02:32:21.057]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:32:21.057 --> 02:32:25.122]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:32:25.122 --> 02:32:27.384]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:32:27.384 --> 02:32:33.412]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:32:34.142 --> 02:32:37.965]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[02:32:37.965 --> 02:32:39.226]  Others don't.
[02:32:39.226 --> 02:32:41.348]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:32:41.348 --> 02:32:43.129]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:32:43.129 --> 02:32:46.012]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:32:46.012 --> 02:32:50.255]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:32:50.255 --> 02:32:52.657]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:32:52.657 --> 02:32:55.359]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:32:55.359 --> 02:32:57.721]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[02:32:57.721 --> 02:32:58.522]  Others don't.
[02:33:08.368 --> 02:33:11.890]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:11.890 --> 02:33:15.232]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:31.067 --> 02:33:35.650]  Gary Jackson and Joe Biggs are back from combat.
[02:33:35.650 --> 02:33:37.471]  Ten days in Ferguson, Missouri.
[02:33:37.471 --> 02:33:39.152]  It's now spreading around the country.
[02:33:39.152 --> 02:33:41.894]  This is George Soros, the Democratic Party have planned.
[02:33:41.894 --> 02:33:45.056]  All they've got is just hoping for an uprising.
[02:33:45.056 --> 02:33:46.277]  Classic communist tactic.
[02:33:46.917 --> 02:33:49.899]  Being used by foreign banks to work other places, why not here?
[02:33:49.899 --> 02:34:00.527]  And they've got demonstrations starting up, then the police can put it down, and then either the police state comes in and they get total control of the globalists, or they actually have a socialist-communist overthrow.
[02:34:00.527 --> 02:34:11.836]  Then a civil war starts, and then after the police and military are chewed up in a five-year war, which the Rand Corporation's been preparing for, then they bring in the UN troops, as Henry Kissinger said, and the public is thankful for it.
[02:34:12.705 --> 02:34:27.097]  To quote his address in 1991 at Bilderberg in Avignon, France, when presented with this scenario, riot, civil unrest, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by their world government.
[02:34:27.097 --> 02:34:30.420]  Henry Kissinger, front page of Infowars.com.
[02:34:30.420 --> 02:34:37.846]  The problem is, if most of the country has guns, you can't have total widespread anarchy.
[02:34:37.846 --> 02:34:39.828]  Even if you order the police to stand down.
[02:34:39.828 --> 02:34:40.889]  Hence, take the guns.
[02:34:43.218 --> 02:34:45.780]  And this is just disgusting that this is happening.
[02:34:45.780 --> 02:34:47.121]  The police were ordered to stand down.
[02:34:47.121 --> 02:34:48.182]  They're under federal control.
[02:34:48.182 --> 02:34:49.843]  The governor said that.
[02:34:49.843 --> 02:34:52.906]  The National Guard was stopped until they could get it stirred up.
[02:34:52.906 --> 02:34:57.569]  And now the Democrats are launching all over the country, I guess, for a Thanksgiving surprise.
[02:34:57.569 --> 02:35:02.873]  We are joined, and then we'll go to James first, who disagrees and says that I'm being racist.
[02:35:02.873 --> 02:35:04.274]  I can't wait to hear this.
[02:35:04.274 --> 02:35:10.539]  And then we'll go to Rob, Richard, Stan, and John by the time the broadcast ends.
[02:35:10.539 --> 02:35:12.481]  But I'm not just covering this, guys, because
[02:35:13.993 --> 02:35:15.074]  It's an interesting story.
[02:35:15.074 --> 02:35:18.697]  It's a microcosm into how media works, how psyops work.
[02:35:18.697 --> 02:35:43.577]  I'm not bragging again to the audience, InfoWars.com, go to my July 17th special alert TV news piece the next day, watch it in an article, predicting this, because when the big red one, when the standard army is training with role players, who every one of them are black, and practicing throwing them in FEMA camps during civil unrest, why would there be a big black uprising?
[02:35:45.595 --> 02:36:02.440]  Because the media is hyping this up, and the only racism here is the undertone to accept the police state and troops on the street, as a major general is now called for on CNN, by stirring up an inner-city black community and the media throwing fire saying they should be out there, they should be angry.
[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:04.881]  CNN and others up until now...
[02:36:06.092 --> 02:36:16.748]  Defending violence, calling it protesting, to then demonize protesting itself, then that scares white communities, middle class communities, you name it, into accepting the police state.
[02:36:17.802 --> 02:36:24.547]  And then having soft racism because of what they've seen, all manipulated by the globalists.
[02:36:24.547 --> 02:36:26.969]  That's how they operate, Problem, Reaction, Solution.
[02:36:26.969 --> 02:36:28.931]  So Jakari Jackson is back.
[02:36:28.931 --> 02:36:30.472]  Joe Biggs is back.
[02:36:30.472 --> 02:36:36.616]  Jakari, you just said quite a bit during the break when you walked in here about the guys that were around you kind of threatening you and stuff.
[02:36:36.616 --> 02:36:38.618]  I mean, repeat what you said earlier.
[02:36:38.618 --> 02:36:40.660]  You also talked about folks that always want
[02:36:41.320 --> 02:36:45.082]  You know, us to go out and call for violence, but, or somebody else to go out and do it.
[02:36:45.082 --> 02:36:45.562]  Jakari?
[02:36:45.562 --> 02:36:47.183]  That's pretty much what happened last night.
[02:36:47.183 --> 02:36:50.624]  I was confronted by some guy, and he says, hey, you're Jakari Jackson.
[02:36:50.624 --> 02:36:51.024]  I said, yeah.
[02:36:51.024 --> 02:36:52.145]  He said, you work for Alex Jones.
[02:36:52.145 --> 02:36:52.505]  I said, yeah.
[02:36:52.505 --> 02:36:54.826]  He said, Alex Jones is out here calling us terrorists.
[02:36:54.826 --> 02:36:57.707]  I said, well, he said he's out here calling black people terrorists.
[02:36:57.707 --> 02:37:02.509]  I said, no, the issue is the people who are out here burning down the buildings, looting the Boost Mobile store.
[02:37:02.509 --> 02:37:06.091]  That's the people who are the problem, not because of the color of your skin.
[02:37:06.091 --> 02:37:07.592]  And then, you know, it's this older guy.
[02:37:07.592 --> 02:37:09.352]  He's probably about five, six, whatever.
[02:37:09.352 --> 02:37:10.793]  And the whole time he's yelling loud and he's
[02:37:10.973 --> 02:37:11.694]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:37:31.227 --> 02:37:37.753]  And then his argument pretty much fell apart because then Joe came over there and he was like, there's Joe Biggs.
[02:37:37.753 --> 02:37:39.775]  He's saying this and that and Biggs is like, no.
[02:37:39.775 --> 02:37:45.060]  And you know, the hardest thing this time around is just convincing people that we weren't police or whatever.
[02:37:45.060 --> 02:37:49.163]  You know, the first couple of days we get there, we're dressed in black, we have body armor on and all that stuff.
[02:37:49.163 --> 02:37:53.367]  And the people who didn't recognize us from the first time, they were real skeptical of our presence.
[02:37:53.367 --> 02:37:56.070]  But then after a couple of days, they heard about us, they went back and watched some of our
[02:37:56.750 --> 02:37:58.853]  He was trying to provocateur it looked to me like a fight
[02:38:11.647 --> 02:38:16.010]  He was the same guy that was there the night before too, right before the riot broke out.
[02:38:16.010 --> 02:38:21.034]  He was sitting there right against the metal barricade, screaming and cussing at the cops, saying he was going to get them.
[02:38:21.034 --> 02:38:22.495]  It was the same guy, all I did was change his name.
[02:38:22.495 --> 02:38:24.456]  Well, it's good you didn't show fear though, when those other guys came over.
[02:38:24.456 --> 02:38:27.498]  Like you said earlier, when more came over, you just said, alright, I'm ready to fight them.
[02:38:27.498 --> 02:38:32.882]  Yeah, I mean, I wasn't out there looking for a fight, but you know, I'm not a real kind of back down guy.
[02:38:32.882 --> 02:38:35.424]  You know, I was like, you know, if it's going to go to that point.
[02:38:35.424 --> 02:38:39.126]  That's the thing, when there's more people, you almost feel tougher.
[02:38:39.126 --> 02:38:40.668]  It's like, you want to gang up on me?
[02:38:41.348 --> 02:38:45.270]  Yeah, I mean, but the guys who came over, the younger guys, they weren't so much bowing up to me.
[02:38:45.270 --> 02:38:47.971]  They were disagreeing with me, which, you know, is fine.
[02:38:47.971 --> 02:38:49.692]  Well, they were sticking their fingers in your face at first.
[02:38:49.692 --> 02:38:50.953]  Yeah, I mean, but they chilled out.
[02:38:50.953 --> 02:38:52.734]  They, you know, just some young, excitable guys.
[02:38:52.734 --> 02:38:53.995]  Oh, that guy was lying to him, yeah.
[02:38:53.995 --> 02:38:57.296]  Yeah, it was the guy, the older guy in the brown ski mask.
[02:38:57.296 --> 02:38:59.858]  He has to wear two masks to walk down the street in his own neighborhood.
[02:38:59.858 --> 02:39:01.398]  He's the one trying to kick up stuff.
[02:39:01.398 --> 02:39:02.799]  I doubt it's even his own neighborhood.
[02:39:02.799 --> 02:39:04.080]  He's probably from somewhere else.
[02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:07.182]  Well, he claimed he was a resident, but he claimed whatever.
[02:39:07.182 --> 02:39:08.022]  There's a lot of people that do.
[02:39:08.022 --> 02:39:08.702]  Yeah.
[02:39:08.702 --> 02:39:09.703]  And then he was telling you to go?
[02:39:10.896 --> 02:39:12.538]  Yeah, and he was like, yeah, get out of here.
[02:39:12.538 --> 02:39:14.180]  And I'm like, you came in my face.
[02:39:14.180 --> 02:39:15.261]  I'm not backing down.
[02:39:15.261 --> 02:39:19.105]  And that's when the guys came over and he just was like, oh my gosh, he's not backing down.
[02:39:19.105 --> 02:39:23.730]  And then I don't know how those guys, maybe you're talking to him, Joe, the Danish guys, they came over.
[02:39:23.730 --> 02:39:24.511]  Yeah, they came up to me.
[02:39:24.511 --> 02:39:25.753]  And they started filming us.
[02:39:25.753 --> 02:39:27.735]  I'm like, and I just thought they were filming the scene.
[02:39:27.735 --> 02:39:29.597]  He's like, no, we're doing the thing on alternative media.
[02:39:29.597 --> 02:39:31.779]  So we'll be on Danish TV.
[02:39:31.779 --> 02:39:32.200]  Good job.
[02:39:33.652 --> 02:39:36.153]  Your take on the situation, Joe?
[02:39:36.153 --> 02:39:37.454]  It's now spreading all over the country.
[02:39:37.454 --> 02:39:39.295]  I mean, it's spiraled out of control.
[02:39:39.295 --> 02:39:42.277]  I mean, this is no longer a protest.
[02:39:42.277 --> 02:39:48.100]  I mean, there's some people out there that are protesting, and that's fine and dandy.
[02:39:48.100 --> 02:39:53.643]  But then when a lot of these outsiders come in and cite violence, start burning stuff down, that's where you're going to draw the line.
[02:39:53.643 --> 02:39:56.805]  But it is terrorism to shoot at fire department people.
[02:39:56.805 --> 02:39:57.125]  Oh, yeah.
[02:39:57.125 --> 02:39:58.466]  I mean, it's the definition.
[02:39:58.466 --> 02:39:59.627]  I was literally filming there.
[02:39:59.627 --> 02:40:01.528]  I was standing right behind the truck, and I could hear it.
[02:40:02.208 --> 02:40:02.348]  Yeah.
[02:40:32.348 --> 02:40:35.431]  When you were there last week, folks were saying, this is a psy-op, stir everybody up.
[02:40:35.431 --> 02:40:36.992]  That's what the real locals were saying.
[02:40:36.992 --> 02:40:42.257]  Yeah, we talked to people at the grocery store, and they were like, yo, we want this to be over, but we think people are stirring up.
[02:40:42.257 --> 02:40:45.440]  We've got outside provocateurs coming in and trying to burn the city down.
[02:40:45.440 --> 02:40:47.522]  Burning the city down isn't going to help anything.
[02:40:47.522 --> 02:40:52.226]  Well, now you've got Democratic Party known groups all over the country running this.
[02:40:52.226 --> 02:40:53.227]  What do you think they're planning?
[02:40:54.079 --> 02:40:57.242]  I just think they want to see the collapse of the city.
[02:40:57.242 --> 02:41:03.688]  I don't know why they want so bad to wound this city any more than what it already has been, but some people want that.
[02:41:03.688 --> 02:41:06.351]  I guess they profit off that in some way.
[02:41:06.351 --> 02:41:07.191]  It's beyond that now.
[02:41:07.191 --> 02:41:09.393]  If they start calling military to these other cities as well...
[02:41:10.134 --> 02:41:11.375]  I mean, that's what they want.
[02:41:11.375 --> 02:41:12.175]  Martial law.
[02:41:12.175 --> 02:41:17.319]  They want a reason to have all these police in the heavy armor and the tear... Can you hand me that tear gas canister, Alex?
[02:41:17.319 --> 02:41:17.739]  Right here.
[02:41:17.739 --> 02:41:20.701]  Because they keep lying and saying that they didn't use it.
[02:41:20.701 --> 02:41:22.622]  This is a CS gas... Well, that is the problem.
[02:41:22.622 --> 02:41:24.163]  And then the government lies.
[02:41:24.163 --> 02:41:25.064]  They're bad, too.
[02:41:25.064 --> 02:41:25.364]  Yeah.
[02:41:25.364 --> 02:41:26.565]  Because they're behind it.
[02:41:26.565 --> 02:41:26.725]  Yeah.
[02:41:27.335 --> 02:41:30.519]  So I mean, it's a lot of blame to go around, but it's not.
[02:41:30.519 --> 02:41:31.581]  Everybody in the crowd is bad.
[02:41:31.581 --> 02:41:33.723]  There's bad people in the crowd and there's good people in the crowd.
[02:41:33.723 --> 02:41:34.564]  Same thing with the police.
[02:41:34.564 --> 02:41:35.946]  The police were really bad in August.
[02:41:35.946 --> 02:41:37.468]  This time around they were much more calm.
[02:41:37.468 --> 02:41:38.630]  You guys glad to be home?
[02:41:38.630 --> 02:41:39.631]  Had much better leadership.
[02:41:39.631 --> 02:41:41.513]  Yeah, it is nice to be back home.
[02:41:42.438 --> 02:41:44.059]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:41:44.059 --> 02:41:46.021]  Banned and more, but they can use them in Ferguson, Missouri.
[02:41:46.021 --> 02:41:49.023]  And then they said, we didn't use these, and then Joe gave them an earful.
[02:41:49.023 --> 02:41:50.865]  Yeah.
[02:41:50.865 --> 02:41:57.070]  It says CS Gas, and then on there it says, do not use on humans.
[02:41:57.070 --> 02:42:04.556]  But there we were criticizing the police, and they shot Joe with rubber bullets, and you with tear gas, and how they lied so they were helping the TV crews when they took their cameras.
[02:42:04.556 --> 02:42:05.117]  Al Jazeera.
[02:42:05.117 --> 02:42:09.460]  But now, oh, we were great then, but we were still criticizing the looters.
[02:42:09.460 --> 02:42:09.881]  Now that
[02:42:10.521 --> 02:42:12.862]  It's clearly, you know, really dangerous.
[02:42:12.862 --> 02:42:14.483]  People getting killed and stuff.
[02:42:14.483 --> 02:42:19.646]  Oh, now, you know, Jakari, you're a sellout because you don't want to shoot fire department people.
[02:42:19.646 --> 02:42:27.410]  No, I don't, you know, expect anybody to go out there and shoot a fire department official or burn down a building or loot a Boost Mobile store.
[02:42:27.410 --> 02:42:31.252]  You know, and a lot of people, they have animosity towards Darren Wilson in that area.
[02:42:31.252 --> 02:42:35.754]  But I'm like, what is looting the Boost Mobile store going to do to do anything to Darren Wilson?
[02:42:35.834 --> 02:42:39.637]  Well, the suspicious thing about all these fires, though, too, like I said, the doors were locked.
[02:42:39.637 --> 02:42:43.400]  The firefighters had to use chainsaws to try to get in.
[02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:45.522]  So how is there a fire in the center of the building?
[02:42:45.522 --> 02:42:48.444]  It might not have been the Justice Department doing it, though they're prime suspects.
[02:42:48.444 --> 02:42:51.987]  They've been caught doing false flags like Fast and Furious.
[02:42:51.987 --> 02:42:55.590]  Business owners could have used this as a cover to get insurance money.
[02:42:55.590 --> 02:42:59.273]  There is a possibility, yeah, I mean... I mean, who believes they would torch the black church?
[02:43:00.492 --> 02:43:02.753]  Well, that's where the pastor was, I believe.
[02:43:02.753 --> 02:43:10.216]  It's already had 75 death threats, and the FBI was actually investigating 75 threats since back in August.
[02:43:10.216 --> 02:43:12.577]  And why is he having the threats?
[02:43:12.577 --> 02:43:17.240]  Just for speaking out about what's going on, just saying, hey, everybody, you know, cooler heads will prevail.
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:19.160]  Yeah, he wanted a calmer solution.
[02:43:19.160 --> 02:43:20.521]  Oh, so he's not stirring it up.
[02:43:20.521 --> 02:43:20.821]  Yeah.
[02:43:20.821 --> 02:43:22.062]  Yeah, pretty much.
[02:43:22.062 --> 02:43:23.322]  He's probably racist, too, then.
[02:43:23.322 --> 02:43:23.722]  Yeah.
[02:43:23.722 --> 02:43:24.403]  I mean, sarcastic.
[02:43:25.989 --> 02:43:26.930]  That's kind of what it is.
[02:43:26.930 --> 02:43:32.175]  It's gotten to the point where even black people are doing that against other black people because they have no argument.
[02:43:32.175 --> 02:43:33.777]  You're a racist.
[02:43:33.777 --> 02:43:35.038]  I got tear gassed with these guys.
[02:43:35.038 --> 02:43:36.320]  I walk with these guys.
[02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:38.362]  I got chased by MRAPs with these guys.
[02:43:38.362 --> 02:43:42.046]  So, you know, people know that they can go watch those videos and just see if this guy just wanted...
[02:43:42.386 --> 02:43:45.951]  Yeah, well it's not just inner city places that are dumbed down.
[02:43:45.951 --> 02:43:48.555]  The general public's either awake or totally dumb.
[02:43:48.555 --> 02:43:52.800]  I mean, I talk to people all the time, white, black, Hispanic, who can't even talk.
[02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:56.325]  I mean, they've got a job, they even drive a nice car, but they don't know what planet they're on.
[02:43:57.011 --> 02:43:58.553]  But they can tell you about every TV show.
[02:43:58.553 --> 02:44:02.157]  Remember, they were like, don't worry, this won't affect Dancing with the Stars a few days ago.
[02:44:02.157 --> 02:44:05.761]  I saw that in the news, like, who cares, you know?
[02:44:05.761 --> 02:44:07.984]  People want to see that Dancing with the Stars, I guess.
[02:44:07.984 --> 02:44:11.568]  There was some dancing around and some stars going off.
[02:44:11.568 --> 02:44:13.691]  You can call them flashbangs, though, the other night.
[02:44:13.691 --> 02:44:14.431]  That was a, uh...
[02:44:15.404 --> 02:44:17.864]  That's one of those events, like I said, you'll never get that out of your mind.
[02:44:17.864 --> 02:44:22.665]  That was crazy to see something like that happen in America, on the streets.
[02:44:22.665 --> 02:44:26.086]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of police officers walking up and down the road.
[02:44:26.086 --> 02:44:29.547]  And then last night, going back out and seeing that road, and it's just dead.
[02:44:29.547 --> 02:44:30.307]  There's nothing there.
[02:44:30.307 --> 02:44:34.148]  Yeah, the entire road is blocked off because the entire street is a crime scene.
[02:44:34.148 --> 02:44:40.029]  Well, I just have folks calling in, and I appreciate them calling in, and I respect what they have to say, but why don't you want to get something done, Alex?
[02:44:41.867 --> 02:44:44.248]  Well, I mean, ruining a black neighborhood?
[02:44:44.248 --> 02:44:54.570]  Well, the issue I encounter a lot at, you know, any demonstration I go to, you know, that you always have, I guess, the hotheads, and they always want you to go out and start the violence.
[02:44:54.570 --> 02:44:56.370]  You know, kind of like this guy last night.
[02:44:56.370 --> 02:44:58.950]  You know, he wanted other people to come over and get involved.
[02:44:58.950 --> 02:45:00.451]  He didn't want to do it himself.
[02:45:00.451 --> 02:45:02.531]  But you have that in many different scenarios.
[02:45:02.531 --> 02:45:03.751]  They, let's go do it.
[02:45:03.751 --> 02:45:05.652]  It's not, I'm going to go, you know, burn the church.
[02:45:05.652 --> 02:45:07.632]  That guy was such a wimp, though, and you said, no.
[02:45:08.192 --> 02:45:09.913]  I'm not backing off, better watch it.
[02:45:09.913 --> 02:45:11.813]  He like actually stepped back.
[02:45:11.813 --> 02:45:13.754]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[02:45:13.754 --> 02:45:16.855]  I mean, it's not even about that guy, because I don't want this to be about me.
[02:45:16.855 --> 02:45:17.876]  It's more about the people.
[02:45:17.876 --> 02:45:19.076]  No, but he's a microcosm.
[02:45:19.076 --> 02:45:26.679]  Yeah, he's a microcosm, but you know, there's still people out there protesting and trying to get, you know, their point across, whatever that may be.
[02:45:26.679 --> 02:45:27.599]  Well, whatever.
[02:45:27.599 --> 02:45:31.060]  We're here to bring people together against tyranny, to promote the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:45:31.060 --> 02:45:33.241]  Let's talk to James in Pennsylvania.
[02:45:33.241 --> 02:45:34.141]  Disagrees.
[02:45:34.141 --> 02:45:34.702]  You're on the air.
[02:45:34.702 --> 02:45:35.502]  Thanks for calling in, sir.
[02:45:36.770 --> 02:45:37.530]  Alex, how are you?
[02:45:37.530 --> 02:45:43.512]  You know, I have a big issue with what you're saying.
[02:45:43.512 --> 02:45:49.613]  You know the implications of labeling someone or people terrorists in our society today.
[02:45:49.613 --> 02:45:54.795]  But yet, you didn't use the term hoodlum, you didn't say thugs, you called them terrorists.
[02:45:54.795 --> 02:46:00.736]  There was a coward out here who shot, he snipered the state troopers over here.
[02:46:00.736 --> 02:46:01.396]  He was a coward.
[02:46:01.396 --> 02:46:04.157]  You didn't call him a terrorist or anybody like that.
[02:46:04.457 --> 02:46:05.798]  Actually I did, actually I did.
[02:46:05.798 --> 02:46:27.873]  I said, I said, I said about three weeks ago, I said, I forget his name, he was obsessed with like Russian military or something, or World War I. He wanted to, he was obviously mentally ill, but you could define it as that because he went out cold-bloodedly just to kill somebody, to terrorize people, and he was white, and I said this is terrorism, and look at how they've shut down everything in total fear.
[02:46:28.673 --> 02:46:39.720]  I know they're applying terrorist laws to things that aren't terrorism, like marijuana and things, and I trailblazed getting cities and counties and states to say they wouldn't enforce the Patriot Act, literally.
[02:46:39.720 --> 02:46:46.625]  But I'm not even... The point is, I said the police should... You're missing what I've said, and I'm sorry if I talk fast.
[02:46:46.625 --> 02:46:47.145]  It's my fault.
[02:46:47.145 --> 02:46:48.526]  Let me say it this way.
[02:46:48.526 --> 02:46:49.867]  Go back to yesterday.
[02:46:49.867 --> 02:46:52.549]  What I said is the police not protecting the firefighters.
[02:46:53.740 --> 02:46:56.722]  are liable and they're becoming cowards following those orders.
[02:46:56.722 --> 02:47:10.150]  This is a stand down because it's terrorism to try to shoot firefighters and by the definition of old-fashioned terrorism before 9-11, carrying out violence for political aim, threatening to kill people is the definition.
[02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:10.990]  You can pull it up.
[02:47:10.990 --> 02:47:12.311]  That's a paraphrase.
[02:47:12.311 --> 02:47:16.654]  Trying to shoot firefighters is the lowest thing I can think of.
[02:47:16.654 --> 02:47:18.655]  It's just totally ridiculous.
[02:47:19.639 --> 02:47:20.480]  There's the definition.
[02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:23.863]  The use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims.
[02:47:23.863 --> 02:47:24.864]  Joe Biggs, you want to comment?
[02:47:24.864 --> 02:47:26.065]  We'll go back to James.
[02:47:26.065 --> 02:47:28.628]  Yes, I mean, when you're shooting at firefighters, that's terrorism.
[02:47:28.628 --> 02:47:31.791]  When you're going out there and you're burning down people's businesses, yes.
[02:47:31.791 --> 02:47:32.812]  Not everybody out there.
[02:47:32.812 --> 02:47:34.974]  I never said that black people were terrorists.
[02:47:34.974 --> 02:47:39.378]  I said that the people who were committing those crimes, those were acts of terrorism.
[02:47:39.378 --> 02:47:44.322]  Because you're putting people... And the FBI at Waco, the ATF was an act of terrorism.
[02:47:44.322 --> 02:47:44.503]  Yeah.
[02:47:45.492 --> 02:47:50.434]  I mean, I just don't know how you can't understand that.
[02:47:50.434 --> 02:47:54.895]  That you're shocked by the fact that someone would call that... No, but see, there's solidarity.
[02:47:54.895 --> 02:47:59.437]  He's saying that it demonized... No, the people shooting there are demonizing the protesters.
[02:47:59.437 --> 02:47:59.857]  Exactly.
[02:47:59.857 --> 02:48:03.018]  Who have every right to be there and who we were supportive of overall.
[02:48:03.018 --> 02:48:10.901]  You understand, we're trying to stop... The feds told the police to stand down so they could let criminals run wild to demonize the people.
[02:48:10.901 --> 02:48:12.422]  Do you understand the PSYOP, sir?
[02:48:14.557 --> 02:48:15.758]  Yeah, I do.
[02:48:15.758 --> 02:48:18.940]  And I agree with you that it might be a SYOP.
[02:48:18.940 --> 02:48:20.841]  I have no argument with you there.
[02:48:20.841 --> 02:48:26.565]  But you're using terms pre-911 when we're... That's like calling us Negroes.
[02:48:26.565 --> 02:48:28.306]  We don't use those terms anymore.
[02:48:28.306 --> 02:48:32.309]  For you to label us terrorists, it puts us in that category in 2014.
[02:48:32.309 --> 02:48:36.452]  Well, they're a bunch of white, white drag rat...
[02:48:36.972 --> 02:48:39.414]  Trust fund, trendy anarchists running around.
[02:48:39.414 --> 02:48:43.496]  They're probably the ones burning stuff, because I've dealt with them a lot through the years.
[02:48:43.496 --> 02:48:44.577]  They're probably working for the feds.
[02:48:44.577 --> 02:48:46.858]  So, let's get one thing straight.
[02:48:46.858 --> 02:48:50.501]  I wasn't implying that black people are terrorists.
[02:48:50.501 --> 02:48:52.902]  The act.
[02:48:52.902 --> 02:48:53.863]  Do you hear what I'm saying, James?
[02:48:55.035 --> 02:48:55.856]  I hear what you're saying.
[02:48:55.856 --> 02:49:01.060]  I just, I listen to you every now and then and I've never heard you use the word terrorist.
[02:49:01.060 --> 02:49:06.204]  Well, I was getting mad at firefighters getting shot at and just said the cops should do something.
[02:49:06.204 --> 02:49:10.127]  Here you have terrorism and they're sitting on their fat butts.
[02:49:10.127 --> 02:49:11.728]  I have no argument, like I said, that...
[02:49:12.412 --> 02:49:17.134]  These hoodlums, these thugs that are out, nobody could justify that, and by no means am I saying that.
[02:49:17.134 --> 02:49:20.156]  I just have disagreement with you using the word terrorist.
[02:49:20.156 --> 02:49:21.957]  So it's just a semantic issue.
[02:49:21.957 --> 02:49:26.579]  No, I hear you, I hear you, I hear you, I hear you, and it caused the debate I wanted.
[02:49:26.579 --> 02:49:28.800]  Okay, but I hear you, I appreciate your call.
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:30.221]  Zucari?
[02:49:30.221 --> 02:49:37.804]  No, I was just asking the gentleman if it was just a semantic issue, because he said, you know, if you would have called them thugs or, you know, looters or whatever else, he wouldn't have an issue with that.
[02:49:37.804 --> 02:49:39.005]  I guess it's just the word.
[02:49:39.881 --> 02:49:46.206]  Um, but I mean, look, they call being a patriot or promoting liberty terrorism or suing the cops paper terrorism.
[02:49:46.206 --> 02:49:48.147]  They've expanded it to stuff that isn't terrorism.
[02:49:48.147 --> 02:49:50.669]  I was saying this is terrorism.
[02:49:50.669 --> 02:49:54.872]  It's definitely criminal to maliciously burn down a building or to shoot at firefighters.
[02:49:54.872 --> 02:49:56.073]  It's meant to create fear.
[02:49:56.073 --> 02:49:59.235]  It's meant to run them out so you can commit more crime and take over.
[02:49:59.235 --> 02:50:00.076]  That's terrorism.
[02:50:02.785 --> 02:50:05.772]  I mean, I don't know how else to explain it to people.
[02:50:05.772 --> 02:50:06.915]  We're going to go to break and come back.
[02:50:06.915 --> 02:50:08.418]  We'll do a little bit of overdrive with these guys.
[02:50:08.418 --> 02:50:09.260]  We can finish up with...
[02:50:11.246 --> 02:50:14.209]  Rob, Richard, Stan, and then John.
[02:50:14.209 --> 02:50:15.910]  That'll be it for calls.
[02:50:15.910 --> 02:50:18.592]  And then, of course, we've got Thanksgiving coming up on Friday.
[02:50:18.592 --> 02:50:21.134]  We'll be live Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:50:21.134 --> 02:50:22.395]  Nightly News is coming up tonight.
[02:50:22.395 --> 02:50:23.877]  We'll be live again.
[02:50:23.877 --> 02:50:31.523]  Everybody's exhausted around here because, especially the radio crew, they get in here at, like, 9, and they've been staying up here until 11 at night, so great job, the radio crew.
[02:50:31.523 --> 02:50:33.304]  And I want to thank everybody for their support out there.
[02:50:34.201 --> 02:50:38.325]  We couldn't build an organization like this without your support.
[02:50:38.325 --> 02:50:41.929]  And that's why we've got Buy 4 Silver.

[02:54:06.679 --> 02:54:08.500]  I read the news today.
[02:54:08.500 --> 02:54:10.301]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:10.301 --> 02:54:12.142]  I'm Ja'Kari Jackson along with Joe Biggs.
[02:54:12.142 --> 02:54:13.683]  We're going to take a few calls.
[02:54:13.683 --> 02:54:15.705]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rob in Montana.
[02:54:15.705 --> 02:54:16.945]  Thanks for calling, Rob.
[02:54:16.945 --> 02:54:21.068]  Hi, um, Alex is gone then.
[02:54:21.068 --> 02:54:23.749]  Is he there?
[02:54:23.749 --> 02:54:26.211]  Uh, yeah, he just stepped out for a second.
[02:54:26.211 --> 02:54:27.432]  Okay.
[02:54:27.432 --> 02:54:30.053]  I've been listening for years.
[02:54:30.053 --> 02:54:36.037]  I pray for Alex and his family and the staff and the guests and the listeners every night.
[02:54:37.068 --> 02:54:39.369]  Thank you.
[02:54:39.369 --> 02:54:45.090]  I agree with nearly, you're welcome, I agree with nearly a hundred percent of what Alex says.
[02:54:45.090 --> 02:54:49.252]  I almost never disagree with him.
[02:54:49.252 --> 02:55:03.096]  No one's against this Satanic New World Order more than I am, and unless we start addressing it spiritually as a Satanic New World Order run by Luciferians,
[02:55:03.996 --> 02:55:05.976]  We will never conquer this thing.
[02:55:05.976 --> 02:55:10.837]  Well, I do agree that spirituality does help.
[02:55:10.837 --> 02:55:15.318]  Or, you know, it is a spiritual battle, ultimately, you know, referencing the book of Revelations.
[02:55:15.318 --> 02:55:18.759]  So I don't disagree with your point.
[02:55:18.759 --> 02:55:24.000]  I guess my question is, what were you disagreeing with?
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:32.001]  Well, I was disagreeing with Alex in the fact that none of us know exactly what happened on that day.
[02:55:33.392 --> 02:55:36.414]  When Michael Brown was shot.
[02:55:36.414 --> 02:55:37.814]  None of us know exactly what happened.
[02:55:37.814 --> 02:55:48.379]  Now, the first thing that just struck me, it kind of took me back to the Aurora, Colorado theater shooting.
[02:55:48.379 --> 02:55:55.362]  I remember the morning I turned on the news and they said that this kid kicked in the door.
[02:55:55.362 --> 02:55:58.063]  Okay, I'm a builder.
[02:55:58.063 --> 02:55:59.664]  Commercials doors open outward.
[02:56:00.499 --> 02:56:03.361]  So I knew, I knew immediately, the red flags went off.
[02:56:03.361 --> 02:56:09.365]  Okay, then I thought a gorilla, it would take a gorilla to get this door off the hinges.
[02:56:09.365 --> 02:56:11.066]  Okay, so I knew that that was crap.
[02:56:11.066 --> 02:56:13.927]  Okay, it's the same thing here.
[02:56:13.927 --> 02:56:18.470]  When you, now let me, let me see if we can reverse this.
[02:56:18.470 --> 02:56:19.611]  Let me ask you.
[02:56:19.611 --> 02:56:23.593]  Well sir, we want to get to some other callers, so please make your point.
[02:56:23.593 --> 02:56:26.295]  Okay, I'm sorry, I'll make my point real quick here.
[02:56:26.295 --> 02:56:29.117]  If this were, if this were reversed, and
[02:56:30.751 --> 02:56:44.617]  This young man, Michael Brown, was armed, legally, let's say a sidearm, it was visible, and this cop came at him, and he felt threatened for his life, and he shot the cop, and he killed him.
[02:56:44.617 --> 02:56:54.382]  Not only would he be indicted, he would be taken to the county jail, he would be, the crap beat out of him by six or seven cops, and then he'd be held there until they decided
[02:56:55.330 --> 02:56:58.552]  What to do with him, and he would definitely be indicted.
[02:56:58.552 --> 02:57:03.094]  Now, the prosecutor here, the first thing he did was he gave instructions to the grand jury.
[02:57:03.094 --> 02:57:04.775]  They said, this is a special case.
[02:57:04.775 --> 02:57:06.516]  This is different than the rest.
[02:57:06.516 --> 02:57:08.617]  Here's how you're to handle this.
[02:57:08.617 --> 02:57:13.180]  Why wasn't he at least indicted and then go through a trial?
[02:57:13.180 --> 02:57:14.660]  And let's look at all the evidence.
[02:57:14.660 --> 02:57:15.461]  Oh, I agree with that.
[02:57:15.461 --> 02:57:16.922]  Listen, listen, listen, I agree with that.
[02:57:16.922 --> 02:57:18.863]  I had to step out and sign some stuff.
[02:57:18.863 --> 02:57:20.284]  You are absolutely right.
[02:57:20.284 --> 02:57:22.225]  There is corruption in the system.
[02:57:22.225 --> 02:57:23.545]  That police department should be 70% black.
[02:57:25.166 --> 02:57:26.447]  There's a lot of issues.
[02:57:26.447 --> 02:57:29.489]  The point is the Feds know there's injustice.
[02:57:29.489 --> 02:57:36.654]  They're trying to PSYOP to all get us fighting with each other because they know we could take the country back and fix a lot of these problems.
[02:57:36.654 --> 02:57:39.096]  That's what I keep trying to get at is the PSYOP.
[02:57:39.096 --> 02:57:39.876]  I appreciate your call.
[02:57:39.876 --> 02:57:43.759]  And I agree with that guy as far as the analogy he made if Michael Brown had a gun.
[02:57:43.759 --> 02:57:45.700]  I mean, I agree with that 100%.
[02:57:45.700 --> 02:57:48.202]  I guess I just wasn't understanding what he was disagreeing with.
[02:57:49.500 --> 02:57:51.442]  Well, I think they just say they disagree so they can get at the head of the line.
[02:57:51.442 --> 02:57:55.264]  But we've had some folks that legitimately, you know, disagree.
[02:57:55.264 --> 02:57:58.807]  Let me see, like Richard says he disagrees on minor points.
[02:57:58.807 --> 02:58:00.388]  John just says he disagrees.
[02:58:00.388 --> 02:58:04.912]  Stan disagrees on civil war in the USA.
[02:58:04.912 --> 02:58:14.239]  By civil war, not states lining up in two armies, but just civil unrest, breakdown, killings, bombings, you know, black ops, staging stuff.
[02:58:16.954 --> 02:58:18.935]  We're going to go to break, come back and take a few final calls.
[02:58:18.935 --> 02:58:25.458]  Again, don't forget, pre-Black Friday into Cyber Monday, we're going to run specials every day.
[02:58:25.458 --> 02:58:31.620]  Today's special is selling everything out, even though we're already selling out a colloidal silver, Silver Bullet back in.
[02:58:31.620 --> 02:58:33.941]  20% off all silver and free shipping.
[02:58:33.941 --> 02:58:36.663]  Buy four silver, get one free.
[02:58:36.663 --> 02:58:38.203]  20% off and free shipping.
[02:58:38.203 --> 02:58:40.284]  That's the best deal we've ever offered.
[02:58:40.284 --> 02:58:42.585]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:42.585 --> 02:58:44.046]  T to have in the winter months.
[02:58:44.046 --> 02:58:44.786]  Stay with us.
[02:58:44.786 --> 02:58:45.827]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:50.037 --> 02:58:51.298]  Another major health threat.
[02:58:51.298 --> 02:58:56.280]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:58:56.280 --> 02:58:58.941]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:58:58.941 --> 02:59:05.984]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:59:05.984 --> 02:59:08.965]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:59:08.965 --> 02:59:11.947]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:59:11.947 --> 02:59:13.948]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:59:13.948 --> 02:59:16.789]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:59:16.869 --> 02:59:22.591]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:59:22.591 --> 02:59:26.112]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:59:26.112 --> 02:59:29.193]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:59:29.193 --> 02:59:36.515]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[02:59:36.515 --> 02:59:39.736]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[02:59:46.178 --> 02:59:46.678]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:59:46.678 --> 02:59:48.179]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.339 --> 03:00:13.880]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:13.880 --> 03:00:16.261]  We are now entering overdrive.
[03:00:16.261 --> 03:00:21.443]  With your host, Alex Jones broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:21.443 --> 03:00:25.104]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:27.901 --> 03:00:31.984]  Jakari, you were just marveling about Texas Monthly investigating about Bill Hicks.
[03:00:31.984 --> 03:00:37.448]  I just think it's funny, it keeps coming up every few months, you know, when people make videos on YouTube or whatever.
[03:00:37.448 --> 03:00:41.251]  And I'm, I guess I just don't understand why it's Bill Hicks.
[03:00:41.251 --> 03:00:44.053]  Because I see, like, they say, Biggs is like, who did they say?
[03:00:44.053 --> 03:00:45.314]  Oh, they say he's somebody, I can't remember.
[03:00:45.314 --> 03:00:46.294]  I'm all kinds of stuff apparently.
[03:00:46.294 --> 03:00:46.715]  Yeah, he's, yeah.
[03:00:46.715 --> 03:00:49.837]  I'm a reptilian shapeshifter too, like Joe, or Paul Joseph Watson as well.
[03:00:50.563 --> 03:00:53.104]  But it shows that people just don't believe anything now.
[03:00:53.104 --> 03:00:53.284]  Yeah.
[03:00:53.284 --> 03:00:54.865]  They just don't believe the system or anything.
[03:00:54.865 --> 03:00:56.365]  I had a guy email me the other day.
[03:00:56.365 --> 03:01:01.227]  He's like, because I was joking with Paul on his Facebook page, I was like, yeah, I'm a reptilian shapeshifter too.
[03:01:01.227 --> 03:01:02.347]  And the guy emailed me.
[03:01:02.347 --> 03:01:04.168]  He goes, are you really?
[03:01:04.168 --> 03:01:05.209]  Just be honest.
[03:01:05.209 --> 03:01:06.349]  Are you here to harm the humans?
[03:01:06.349 --> 03:01:08.290]  I was like, are you serious?
[03:01:09.591 --> 03:01:11.814]  People believe what they want to believe.
[03:01:11.814 --> 03:01:13.737]  And then that's used to discredit us.
[03:01:13.737 --> 03:01:17.222]  We have the army documents that are public that they're setting all this up.
[03:01:17.222 --> 03:01:19.225]  Nobody cares about that.
[03:01:19.225 --> 03:01:22.170]  All the official chemtrail admissions, nobody cares.
[03:01:22.170 --> 03:01:24.333]  But it's a huge viral story that I'm Bill Hicks.
[03:01:25.416 --> 03:01:26.577]  I'll come clean, I am.
[03:01:26.577 --> 03:01:28.038]  Okay, nothing controversial.
[03:01:28.038 --> 03:01:30.420]  There's going to be 10 videos tomorrow.
[03:01:30.420 --> 03:01:32.482]  Alex Jones admits it.
[03:01:32.482 --> 03:01:35.245]  Oh my goodness.
[03:01:35.245 --> 03:01:35.905]  Really, I'm 51.
[03:01:35.905 --> 03:01:37.246]  That's what he would be, I guess.
[03:01:37.246 --> 03:01:39.608]  I don't look older than 40, but man, maybe 45?
[03:01:41.867 --> 03:01:43.968]  Well, how old do you say I look, Jakari?
[03:01:43.968 --> 03:01:44.568]  Probably 40, 41.
[03:01:44.568 --> 03:01:44.848]  Yeah.
[03:01:44.848 --> 03:01:44.868]  41.
[03:01:44.868 --> 03:01:44.888]  40.
[03:01:44.888 --> 03:01:45.208]  50, 60, 70.
[03:01:45.208 --> 03:01:51.131]  I was supposed to say, it's like I'm a woman.
[03:01:51.131 --> 03:01:53.412]  You look like you're 20, Alex.
[03:01:53.412 --> 03:01:56.113]  Richard Nohia, well, you're on minor points, but go ahead.
[03:01:57.847 --> 03:01:58.928]  Hello, can you hear me?
[03:01:58.928 --> 03:02:00.309]  I sure can.
[03:02:00.309 --> 03:02:02.511]  You're talking to Bill Hicks right now.
[03:02:02.511 --> 03:02:04.712]  I'm a big supporter of you.
[03:02:04.712 --> 03:02:05.793]  I don't sell your magazine.
[03:02:05.793 --> 03:02:11.398]  I buy it from you 50 issues at a time and put them out front of my house in a magazine rack I made that's weatherproof.
[03:02:11.398 --> 03:02:11.738]  Awesome.
[03:02:11.738 --> 03:02:12.839]  We sell them at cost, brother.
[03:02:12.839 --> 03:02:14.160]  Thank you.
[03:02:14.160 --> 03:02:19.484]  I also go at events all over Cincinnati and give away constitutional handbooks.
[03:02:19.484 --> 03:02:21.186]  Again, you're a hardcore patriot.
[03:02:21.186 --> 03:02:22.407]  We love you, but you disagree.
[03:02:22.407 --> 03:02:22.627]  Go ahead.
[03:02:23.357 --> 03:02:34.648]  I disagree with your use of terms calling the emotional rioters terrorists simply because it feeds into the rhetoric of the horror mainstream media.
[03:02:34.648 --> 03:02:35.129]  You know what?
[03:02:35.129 --> 03:02:37.171]  In hindsight, I think you're probably right.
[03:02:37.171 --> 03:02:38.272]  But I was just making the point.
[03:02:43.931 --> 03:03:02.351]  These people are dominated by fear, so they're emotional, they're not thinking logically, and I suggested in your stories, news suggestions, or whatever you call it, that you post pictures of all of the past maybe three years of people who were killed unarmed,
[03:03:02.911 --> 03:03:09.713]  Well, exactly.
[03:03:09.713 --> 03:03:18.455]  The globalists want a PSYOP victory, not for the police, but for the police state to take over the police.
[03:03:18.455 --> 03:03:25.576]  And so they need this case where Brown looks like he's not the best poster child so that they can glaze over all the other stuff.
[03:03:25.576 --> 03:03:28.197]  Like when they were trying to get Dorner and they were like shooting up
[03:03:28.757 --> 03:03:30.557]  Yeah, white women in blue trucks.
[03:03:30.557 --> 03:03:35.659]  It wasn't even, just randomly, I mean, yeah, there are a lot of people out there that shouldn't be policed.
[03:03:35.659 --> 03:03:37.399]  I mean, they're just crazy.
[03:03:37.399 --> 03:03:40.200]  And sir, more to your point, you're saying that we should put a lot of that stuff out.
[03:03:40.200 --> 03:03:44.921]  I've done, I cannot give a realistic number of how many police brutality stories.
[03:03:44.921 --> 03:03:47.081]  I have stories about them shooting dogs.
[03:03:47.081 --> 03:03:48.082]  I mean, all kinds of stuff.
[03:03:48.082 --> 03:03:49.082]  Small dogs.
[03:03:49.082 --> 03:03:51.722]  Yeah, you can find that stuff on our YouTube.
[03:03:51.722 --> 03:03:53.923]  Yeah, people are always like, you need to cover the Federal Reserve.
[03:03:53.923 --> 03:03:54.623]  You know it's private.
[03:03:54.623 --> 03:03:56.384]  I'm like, oh no.
[03:03:56.384 --> 03:03:57.984]  You ever hear of 9-11's inside job?
[03:04:00.046 --> 03:04:00.926]  No, but I hear you, brother.
[03:04:00.926 --> 03:04:02.227]  It's great points.
[03:04:02.227 --> 03:04:02.947]  We're out of time.
[03:04:02.947 --> 03:04:04.108]  Sorry to John of Montana.
[03:04:04.108 --> 03:04:05.268]  Sorry to Stan.
[03:04:05.268 --> 03:04:06.268]  Stan, you can take us out.
[03:04:06.268 --> 03:04:07.229]  You got 45 seconds.
[03:04:07.229 --> 03:04:08.949]  Go ahead, Missouri.
[03:04:08.949 --> 03:04:11.090]  Alex, this is all being orchestrated.
[03:04:11.090 --> 03:04:16.932]  It's just like back then in the 1960s with COINTELPRO and the Weberman Organization.
[03:04:16.932 --> 03:04:18.033]  And Alex...
[03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:29.210]  We, this lawlessness that we've got going on, do you realize we have 30,000 gangs in the United States of America, 1.64 million?
[03:04:29.210 --> 03:04:33.654]  And do you also realize there is a decree of lawlessness in this country?
[03:04:33.654 --> 03:04:35.536]  Now listen to Sheriff Mack.
[03:04:35.536 --> 03:04:37.098]  These people in this country, Alex,
[03:04:38.072 --> 03:04:41.015]  This civil war business, that is a joke.
[03:04:41.015 --> 03:04:44.018]  These people, I went to a karaoke bar last night.
[03:04:44.018 --> 03:04:47.102]  These people don't even know what's going on around them.
[03:04:47.102 --> 03:04:54.049]  When I say a civil war, the globalists will stage a false war to get the patriots and police killing each other.
[03:04:54.049 --> 03:04:55.671]  That's what I'm talking about.
[03:04:55.671 --> 03:04:56.532]  We're out of time.
[03:04:56.532 --> 03:04:58.373]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
[03:04:58.373 --> 03:04:59.535]  We'll see you tomorrow on Thanksgiving.
