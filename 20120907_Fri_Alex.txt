[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:33.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:42.000 --> 00:56.000]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[00:56.000 --> 01:23.000]  there's no question that we have made many important strides in securing our country from terrorism
[01:23.000 --> 01:49.000]  since 9-11 about the threat continues to evolve
[01:49.000 --> 01:57.000]  and in some ways the threat today may be at its most heightened state since the attacks nearly 10 years ago
[01:57.000 --> 02:08.000]  but I think if you just take those three pieces of evidence right there and add two plus two plus two you have the U.S. government letting Mootslap on the plane with an intentionally defective bomb
[02:08.000 --> 02:16.000]  the war on terror is a fraud and it's being used in a manner to take away your rights for whatever reason
[02:16.000 --> 02:24.000]  in addition to the core al-Qaeda group which still represents a threat to the United States despite its diminished capabilities
[02:24.000 --> 02:31.000]  we now face threats from a number of al-Qaeda associates that share its violent extremist ideology
[02:31.000 --> 02:43.000]  among these groups we are also seeing an increased emphasis on recruiting Americans and Westerners to carry out attacks
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  they are also encouraging individuals in the West to carry out their own small scale attacks
[02:48.000 --> 03:02.000]  which require less of the coordination and planning that could raise red flags and lead to an attacks disruption
[03:02.000 --> 03:12.000]  in my 16 years of deep research it has become clear the number one threat to any sovereign free nation is its military
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.000]  look at Nazi Germany look at Latin America look at Asia look at Africa look at Eastern Europe
[03:17.000 --> 03:26.000]  when you build up a giant paramilitary police force it almost always tries to take over the society
[03:26.000 --> 03:33.000]  in the last 12 years we've watched an acceleration of militarization of police we've watched threat fusion centers
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.000]  the 10 FEMA regions expand the governor's council I've been to urban warfare drills
[03:39.000 --> 03:46.000]  where our own military is training to lock down and barricade and blockade US cities and confiscate our firearms
[03:46.000 --> 03:54.000]  this whole program accelerated after 1999 when Congress got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act
[03:54.000 --> 04:02.000]  it allowed private central banks to issue unlimited counterfeit financial instruments known as derivatives
[04:02.000 --> 04:09.000]  and we've heard that oh the military and the police state the TSA it's for al-Qaeda
[04:09.000 --> 04:15.000]  but now we see checkpoints in Tennessee run by the army shutting down highways searching citizens
[04:15.000 --> 04:22.000]  we see them in New York state with x-ray machines we see it all over the nation we see Marines running illegal checkpoints
[04:22.000 --> 04:28.000]  for DUI in California and when the governors and others complain they're told sit down and shut up
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  it's under homeland security it's under continuity of government
[04:33.000 --> 04:41.000]  and now as the world implodes as the derivatives dollar devaluation crisis expands
[04:41.000 --> 05:00.000]  we're seeing the police and military being called out against the general all right that videos from what a couple years ago see the full video online DHS in game we're live it's Friday big show coming up stay with us I'm Alex Jones GCN live.com

[07:57.000 --> 08:17.000]  this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[08:17.000 --> 08:28.000]  this is the live of the information war it's Alex Jones
[08:28.000 --> 08:48.000]  you see evil has always been in the world but there's always been good as well there's different forces in history and every action we engage in every decision we make affects that some balance of what will control the world good or evil
[08:48.000 --> 09:06.000]  the problem with good is that when you get a good generation that generally defeats certain destruction and tyranny such incredible freedom and liberty brings so much wealth that the population becomes extremely decadent within just a few generations
[09:06.000 --> 09:19.000]  I'm surprised the United States with all of its liberty and freedom and hadn't been perfect but compared to others it's been the best we've ever seen I'm surprised it's gone this long before falling into incredible degradation
[09:19.000 --> 09:38.000]  alright ladies and gentlemen gold is turbo exploding today we're going to be going over some of those numbers here on the air with talk of QE3 and the now big EU bond package plan that we told you years ago is what they would push
[09:38.000 --> 09:57.000]  the very banks that have engineered the collapse of demanded bailout after bailout which they get most the money from while blaming the public for the debt that they've been signed on to and then they come out and sell the idea of a new mega bond
[09:57.000 --> 10:12.000]  which in the bond agreement the nation sign over what little sovereignty they had left in fact it came out earlier this year it's just amazing EU planners at the highest levels of the European central bank said we have to get rid of nationalism entirely
[10:12.000 --> 10:29.000]  if we're going to set up this new government for and by the banks and they and they called it a banker occupation themselves they said we have captured Europe and there were jokes about it Goldman Sachs captures Europe because I need to rub it in your face to make you feel absolutely helpless and hopeless
[10:29.000 --> 10:48.000]  it's just it's it's part of the occupiers domination tactic throughout history and they went on to say that they needed to get rid of Euro sports team names that have associations with French or German Spanish or Portuguese or Dutch or Italian
[10:48.000 --> 11:03.000]  any of it and just to make it about you know oh Euro teams with names like you know T Rex or no cave bear I mean they've actually had examples in there of you know but Titans the
[11:03.000 --> 11:24.000]  more like US sports teams that because we're one nation so then our teams are generally based just around mascots except for places like Texas because it's the you know the the Texas teams the cowboys the Texans this is something
[11:24.000 --> 11:36.000]  this is something that is important guys I think the gate or something's been changed on my microphone I can definitely hear changes I'm sure some stuff went on with the microphones yesterday we need to turn those back to however they were thank you
[11:36.000 --> 11:48.000]  I can just hear the difference I can hear the gate coming in and out on me it's over gating things here on me or this microphone's going out which I love these Neumann microphones but I guess me banging the table and hitting them over the years
[11:48.000 --> 11:57.000]  sometimes they break so this microphone may be going out as well this is one of the repaired ones right from the last time I knocked it off the table on accident that's a brand new one okay well
[11:57.000 --> 12:08.000]  long as everything sounds okay to you in there I know audio fluctuations when I hear it my little ears okay what's coming up here on the broadcast today
[12:08.000 --> 12:25.000]  Lyndon LaRouche will be joining us who I agree with his analysis of the geopolitical lay of the land I don't agree with all of his solutions I wasn't to provide though that because much to do has been made of Alex Jones has Lyndon LaRouche on that means he's a communist
[12:25.000 --> 12:39.000]  and then other publications say Lyndon LaRouche is extremely right wing and Jones is right wing as he has him on Lyndon LaRouche just had his 90th birthday what yesterday and love him or hate him
[12:39.000 --> 12:52.000]  they had a former CIA director call him the person with the most important private intelligence network in the world obviously Lyndon LaRouche knows where a lot of the bodies are buried and is an extremely interesting person
[12:52.000 --> 13:04.000]  and again everybody we have here on the air we have them here not just because I agree with everything they're saying that's not the case in most cases in fact in all cases I don't agree with what anybody says completely
[13:04.000 --> 13:13.000]  including myself sometimes I hear rebroadcast and I think I could have said that better I should have said this way or I don't really agree with what I said now that I've looked at it in hindsight
[13:13.000 --> 13:28.000]  and I'm not like oh some of the neocon groups are liberal groups criticizing for having Lyndon LaRouche on because it affects me I'm just putting it out to show how they try to mentally referee and decide who can cover what who can do what
[13:28.000 --> 13:43.000]  you know the media got criticized well Drudge did Matt Drudge or five years ago for reporting that Prince Harry was in Afghanistan I mean that's newsworthy and the whole media reportedly knew about it but wouldn't report on it and his story was pointing that out
[13:43.000 --> 13:56.000]  and then now it's back in the news that he's back in Afghanistan to play the part of the hero after the origin stuff came out and you know there's still the criticisms of how dare anybody cover this
[13:56.000 --> 14:14.000]  just this idea that you shouldn't have this person on or you shouldn't go on that show or I mean they have Reverend Wright on CNN does that mean CNN agrees with the GD America will probably they actually do but it's a nation state
[14:14.000 --> 14:26.000]  now the point is we're going to get into gold it is economic report later in fact I've got two guests coming up today so can we just go ahead and get Ted Anderson on with a quick report on gold say at 45 after
[14:26.000 --> 14:39.000]  John Harmon see if he's actually there at the office because Ted's been predicting this would start in early September not hard to predict it normally happens especially with talk of quantitative easing three coming up that'll trigger inflation big time
[14:39.000 --> 15:02.000]  we're going to be having Ted come on the broadcast here a little bit later we can get him gold is up to $1736 and 60 cents as we speak that is up with $30 plus $36 just today they had a flood of media saying gold isn't good to buy it's evil it's bad
[15:02.000 --> 15:16.000]  don't buy it George Soros we reported three weeks ago is buying up as much as he can all these other elitists are buying up as much as they can and they've done everything they can with paper in the markets leveraging and naked shorting to try to drive down gold and silver
[15:16.000 --> 15:35.000]  but the laws of finance the laws of nature when it comes to currencies says they can suppress it for a while like holding a beach ball down to bottom of the deep end but pretty soon you're going to have to come up for breath and when you finally let go of the beach ball it's not just going to rise slowly from 10 feet of water it's going to shoot out of the water
[15:35.000 --> 15:53.000]  and they may grab it again try to push to the bottom but each time they push it down they can't push it down as far as the time before that's why gold was $260 11 years ago and now it's 1700 has been as high as almost 2000 because if you look at the graph over 11 years it's going straight up
[15:53.000 --> 16:08.000]  okay it's going up and there's little dips but never down as far as it was before could they pull some incredible scam and drive it down to a thousand bucks maybe but then following these graphs it'll go up to 3000 the next time
[16:08.000 --> 16:26.000]  if they over devalue it I don't have gold as an investment I have it as an emergency backup because I don't trust this government in the system and I don't have that much you'll have enough to take care of my family for a while and some silver but you cannot trust the money in the banks
[16:26.000 --> 16:41.000]  and more and more big banks big financial institutions are just taking people's money I've got articles here all over the country today CBS News where they just come and take people's houses that are paid in full and they don't even have a mortgage with Wells Fargo and they just take it
[16:41.000 --> 16:58.000]  it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if they bought that house you know 25 years ago and that it was never even sold as a derivative they're just taking it and the courts are going to give it to them and nothing's going to stop them just like they took the veterans death benefits just like they've got all the police and fire and city worker funds around the country
[16:58.000 --> 17:13.000]  and those city workers will squeeze you to oblivion because they're told raise more money or everything will collapse when that's what's causing the collapse they'll say give us a 20% carbon tax in California and everybody runs out of the state they just don't understand it
[17:13.000 --> 17:33.000]  just like Greece and Spain and Italy raise taxes raise taxes shuts the economy down kills the tax base less money comes in now you're in hot deeper to the bankers who loaned you fiat money to bail them out and then now they own you the fraud is so big it's such a galactic sized hoax
[17:33.000 --> 17:47.000]  now I want to get into huge news this is probably the biggest news of the day we'll cover when we come back White House circulating draft of executive order on cybersecurity remember two months ago or month and a half ago the cybersecurity bill that even seen that news that's that's CBS
[17:47.000 --> 18:04.000]  even Declan McCullis said is basically what Vladimir Putin's doing in Russia it's totally draconian total spying internet taxes controls tracking nightmarish absolutely nightmarish kick you off the web find you fee you know do process hellish
[18:04.000 --> 18:21.000]  Obama said I'll look at executive order the Hill reports White House circulating draft of executive order on cybersecurity show look out Jack Obama said hey don't worry and by the way that thing has got all sorts of draconian anti gun stuff in it and he says the executive order will mirror the bill
[18:21.000 --> 18:36.000]  see oh Congress won't shut down our power plants our cold plants Obama just says I signed executive order by the way I give all my friends waivers I mean hey this is called dictatorship and Obama is a puppet himself a teleprompter reading puppet
[18:36.000 --> 18:52.000]  presidents will come and go but the office has been turned into a dictatorship for all intents and purposes when the president tells the Congress he takes orders from NATO in the UN baby you're not just living in a dictatorship of the executive and bureaucracy you're living in an occupation government
[18:52.000 --> 19:11.000]  saying I take my orders from Europe that's always been who's been taking this country over that's what we've been having wars with is those powerful families over there when Bush had me arrested 15 years ago when he was governor for asking questions at a press conference at the end of his speech he's
[19:11.000 --> 19:22.000]  posting a press conference I'd heard the speech before it was on the agenda that at this time he'd take questions they said no questions right before his speech so at the end of his speech I said governor isn't it Europe through the CFR taking over
[19:22.000 --> 19:36.000]  America the robber barons and he looked at the state police and they almost ripped my shoulder out of its socket I roll over at night and been paying today I'm not about to have surgery on it because I dared ask them a question they bodily hurt me
[19:36.000 --> 19:47.000]  you can watch that footage online just because I was like hey you say you want to take care of Texas what about the new world order and he looked over at the state police and plain closed
[19:47.000 --> 19:56.000]  one of my guess was a Texas Ranger and said deal with it and boy they showed me I didn't resist very polite sure I'll go outside and they go let me show you how it works

[24:11.000 --> 24:21.000]  What would you turn away to? And what if you saw all of the things that's wrong? Would you stand tall and strong?
[24:21.000 --> 24:31.000]  Coming up in the next segment I'm going to get into a White House circulating draft of executive order on cyber security. I mean who needs Congress if they won't pass the bill?
[24:31.000 --> 24:40.000]  We should sign an executive order. I mean why not? Why not just sign us over to Goldman Sachs publicly?
[24:40.000 --> 24:49.000]  But coming up in the next segment before I get into that I'm going to cover this Time Magazine writer jokes about dead fetuses, beauty pageant and RNC.
[24:49.000 --> 24:57.000]  Now I'll be honest with you, I'm friends, well I've known for more than 15 years that the talk show host on this show.
[24:57.000 --> 25:11.000]  They're pretty liberal and my first inclination was to not even cover this just because I know it will be seen by some stirring up trouble.
[25:11.000 --> 25:22.000]  But I mean when something's on the radio it's on the radio. And when it has to do with dead kids that's when whatever the case is I cover it.
[25:22.000 --> 25:30.000]  But I was driving into work yesterday morning at about 8am, came a little bit earlier, got ready here instead of at home.
[25:30.000 --> 25:42.000]  I was listening to 93.7, the Dudley and Bob show. And I'm listening to it, it's the sister station at 5.90am, they also have an FM broadcast of the show.
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.000]  They have three stations, well they have like six or seven, it's MS owned. They're nice folks.
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.000]  I've been on, I don't know, six years or so now on those stations.
[25:50.000 --> 25:59.000]  But the point is is that, and I've been a guest on their show many times, I'm driving in and I hear Time Magazine, in fact I'll just cover this now.
[25:59.000 --> 26:08.000]  I'm a dude up, I'm driving in and I'm listening to Joel Stein of Time Magazine.
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.000]  And it sounds like he's like 10 years old.
[26:13.000 --> 26:25.000]  They're the types of things they're talking about, the things they're going over, they're making fun of Republicans and they're making fun of Christians and how they read the Bible when they protest and things like that.
[26:25.000 --> 26:32.000]  And then he goes into dead fetuses and how the Republicans hold up images of dead fetuses and bloody dead fetuses.
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  We're going to hear it here in a minute.
[26:34.000 --> 26:44.000]  And that he's learned to recognize the attractive ones and that they should have a beauty pageant for dead fetuses.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  And that was no real funny and folks were laughing about that.
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.000]  And the talk show hosts are going, hey, you know, I mean, they're laughing, but then they say, hey, you're going to get us in trouble.
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  Not them in trouble, but why are you saying you're going to get in trouble?
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  Who should get in trouble?
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  And I don't mean having their free speech attacked.
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.000]  I have my free speech to say it's wrong.
[27:03.000 --> 27:04.000]  I have my speech.
[27:04.000 --> 27:07.000]  See, people say free speech is not criticizing somebody's speech.
[27:07.000 --> 27:10.000]  No, no, free speech is you got your speech, I got mine.
[27:10.000 --> 27:17.000]  And it's the fact that people that I know that are pro-abortion, most of them, they get off on it, they laugh.
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  They say, you don't want those ugly black babies.
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  You've heard those clips of abortionists.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  I've heard that my whole life.
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.000]  Speaking out against abortion and radio debates, protesting in abortion clinics.
[27:28.000 --> 27:33.000]  I've done that back when I was just on local TV and radio.
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  I've gone out and protested it.
[27:35.000 --> 27:42.000]  And mainly is to tell the women, you know, there are charities that will pay you to have that baby and give the baby up for charity.
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  They're not going to tell you that inside.
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  You can be paid, I mean, a executive salary to have the kid.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  There's a backlog of people that want children.
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  We have to import babies to adopt.
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  My family has done it.
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  You know, you don't need to do it.
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  Let me tell you the name of some charities.
[27:58.000 --> 28:04.000]  While you see these billboards up that say pregnant, need help, you know, don't want to have an abortion, call us.
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.000]  There are more people wanting to adopt than there are even abortions each year.
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  And they don't want you knowing that.
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.000]  Most those women would end up turning around and leaving, but I'm digressing.
[28:14.000 --> 28:22.000]  The point is that I'm driving along and even if you want to kill babies in the womb and say they're not human,
[28:22.000 --> 28:26.000]  and you think that type of dehumanization is okay and isn't dangerous,
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  because now they're saying kill babies up to age three, the same eugenicist and bioethicist.
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  I mean, top bioethicist journals.
[28:33.000 --> 28:38.000]  In fact, during the break, guys, you print me, bioethics journals has killed children up to age three.
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  They're now calling those fetuses.
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.000]  If you think that's okay, that's your issue.
[28:45.000 --> 28:52.000]  But when you make jokes about it and you talk about, see, the babies can't speak up for themselves.
[28:52.000 --> 28:58.000]  Imagine if we said, let's have a beauty pageant of chopped up black people.
[28:58.000 --> 29:02.000]  Let's see who the prettiest, chopped up, bloody black person is.
[29:02.000 --> 29:03.000]  You would have riots.
[29:03.000 --> 29:08.000]  Or if you said, let's see who the prettiest, chopped up gay person is.
[29:08.000 --> 29:13.000]  Out of a bunch of gay people that have been shot with shotguns or hacked up with machetes,
[29:13.000 --> 29:18.000]  let's have a beauty pageant and see who the most beautiful of the dead corpses is.
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.000]  There would be absolutely outcry and there should be.
[29:21.000 --> 29:22.000]  Okay?
[29:22.000 --> 29:25.000]  But the little babies, nobody's there to protect them.
[29:25.000 --> 29:31.000]  And I'm an extremist because as a human, the idea of women not knowing that's a child,
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  and they don't want you to have an ultrasound so you can see it,
[29:33.000 --> 29:36.000]  they want to chop it up because they're eugenicist.
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.000]  And then you make jokes about it and talk about beauty pageants.
[29:39.000 --> 29:44.000]  You are a piece of inhuman trash and filth and you're going to hell.
[29:44.000 --> 30:10.000]  We're going to come back and play the clip.
[30:15.000 --> 30:18.000]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business,
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  blowing up your food prices.
[30:20.000 --> 30:24.000]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food costs to today's prices
[30:24.000 --> 30:27.000]  by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[30:27.000 --> 30:31.000]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.000]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[30:33.000 --> 30:37.000]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[30:37.000 --> 30:40.000]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[30:40.000 --> 30:44.000]  The fact is you can eat it any time to save money today and because it's stored for 25 years,
[30:44.000 --> 30:47.000]  you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[30:47.000 --> 30:53.000]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[30:53.000 --> 30:58.000]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[30:58.000 --> 31:00.000]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[31:00.000 --> 31:04.000]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative.
[31:04.000 --> 31:06.000]  But not all silver is equal.
[31:06.000 --> 31:11.000]  Silver Soul is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective
[31:11.000 --> 31:13.000]  than colloid or ionic silvers.
[31:13.000 --> 31:16.000]  It can destroy thousands of times more pathogens than older silver technology.
[31:16.000 --> 31:22.000]  Silver Soul resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in labs to kill bacteria and viruses,
[31:22.000 --> 31:24.000]  enabling it to kill without direct contact.
[31:24.000 --> 31:29.000]  Silver Soul is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no resistance and does not harm beneficial bacteria,
[31:29.000 --> 31:31.000]  making it ideal for daily use.
[31:31.000 --> 31:37.000]  It can be used internally as well as topically and is highly effective against viruses, bacteria, molds, and yeasts.
[31:37.000 --> 31:41.000]  With threats like West Nile virus, colds, flus, or any other emergency situation,
[31:41.000 --> 31:43.000]  arm yourself with supernatural silver.
[31:43.000 --> 31:47.000]  Silver Soul liquid and gel are perfect for on-the-go emergency preparedness
[31:47.000 --> 31:49.000]  and can provide protection at home, school, or work.

[32:36.000 --> 32:40.000]  None dare call a conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[32:40.000 --> 32:45.000]  We're also carrying behind the green mask, You in Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.
[32:45.000 --> 32:48.000]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[32:48.000 --> 32:52.000]  The greater good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen,
[32:52.000 --> 32:55.000]  exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[32:55.000 --> 33:00.000]  The titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.
[33:25.000 --> 33:28.000]  For joining us again, I'm Alex Jones, your host on this Friday,
[33:28.000 --> 33:32.000]  the 7th day of September, 2012.
[33:32.000 --> 33:36.000]  I'll be back this Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m. Central, 5 to 7 Eastern.
[33:36.000 --> 33:40.000]  That'll be 2 to 4 Pacific, 3 to 5 Mountain.
[33:40.000 --> 33:43.000]  Mountain, that's the coolest sounding time zone, isn't it?
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  Mountain, I live in Mountain.
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  Yes, it is Mountain out there.
[33:47.000 --> 33:51.000]  We're going to get some reports on gold exploding, governments, institutions,
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.000]  elites grabbing it up while telling you not to get it.
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.000]  I don't want to cover this first, because there's all these world events
[33:58.000 --> 34:01.000]  in Israel saying they're getting ready to head Iran,
[34:01.000 --> 34:05.000]  and there's giant news on the economy, we're going to get to all of it.
[34:05.000 --> 34:10.000]  But nobody in the mainstream media is standing up for children.
[34:10.000 --> 34:16.000]  It's trendy, it's cool, it's fun to make jokes and get real cheeky
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  when you talk about abortion.
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.000]  And to say nobody wants these babies when it's the opposite.
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  Let me tell you, the CPS has to kidnap healthy babies,
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.000]  especially from white folks, there's huge bounties on them.
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.000]  They can get a half mil for a raven-haired blue-eyed girl.
[34:34.000 --> 34:37.000]  $200, $300 grand for a blonde-haired blue-eyed girl or boy.
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  I mean, there's quotas on these that come out.
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  They're hunting your children.
[34:41.000 --> 34:45.000]  A large portion of the CPS are pedophiles, that's why they have that job.
[34:45.000 --> 34:50.000]  They have a 50-plus percent turnover in CPS nationwide, every state,
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.000]  some areas higher, because good people get in who are abused as children,
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.000]  because there are some bad parents, but statistically CPS is five times worse physically,
[34:57.000 --> 35:00.000]  seven times worse sexually, just departments own numbers.
[35:00.000 --> 35:03.000]  Look it up, that's the cover of even Time Magazine admits that.
[35:03.000 --> 35:07.000]  The shame of foster care, but yeah, that's not general foster care,
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  the family down the street that's helping kids.
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  It's the big institutions, generally, they're the worst.
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  So, let's throw them to the most dangerous people,
[35:14.000 --> 35:19.000]  because they have you examples of crackhead moms or whatever with starving kids.
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  Well, they usually leave those kids with them, it comes down.
[35:21.000 --> 35:25.000]  They want those little babies.
[35:25.000 --> 35:30.000]  And they'll take black babies, Hispanic babies as well for adoption.
[35:30.000 --> 35:33.000]  And of course, the families don't know where they're coming from when they're getting them.
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.000]  There's a big bounty on those folks as well.
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  And I've had state senators on, one of them got her head blown off after she came on.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  She's like, I'm coming on next week, I have the proof, the racket, the payoffs for the kids.
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  Dad, her and her husband got down at their house.
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  I mean, this is a mafia you're dealing with.
[35:47.000 --> 35:50.000]  You think black market arts the big business or drugs?
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  No, it's kids, it's sex.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  It's just evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:54.000 --> 36:01.000]  And all of this is going on, and you've heard the abortion doctors that have been caught doing weird rituals with the dead babies.
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.000]  Well, yeah, who wants to sit there and do late term abortions, chopping up, you know, seven, eight, nine month old babies?
[36:06.000 --> 36:07.000]  I mean, you got to be sick.
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  They kill them outside the womb, it's incredible.
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.000]  They throw them in buckets of water, they chop them up, they sell them for medical experiments.
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.000]  And a lot of people don't want to hear this.
[36:17.000 --> 36:18.000]  They're like, I don't want to hear it.
[36:18.000 --> 36:22.000]  Listen, if you had an abortion and were lied to about it, it's okay.
[36:22.000 --> 36:25.000]  The pain will go away if you ask God to forgive you.
[36:25.000 --> 36:30.000]  Or if you don't even believe in God, just understand that you made a mistake and choose life.
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  Choose to put value on humanity.
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  The globalists want to tell us we're trash.
[36:34.000 --> 36:38.000]  They want to say old people are trash and children are trash and mentally retarded people are trash.
[36:38.000 --> 36:43.000]  Don't you understand what you do to the least of these you've done to me?
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  That's Jesus Christ saying that.
[36:45.000 --> 36:52.000]  What you've done, he went on, better for you to tie a millstone around your neck than to hurt the little ones.
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.000]  And the little ones are also the general public who are childlike.
[36:56.000 --> 37:02.000]  Taking advantage of ignorant people, taking advantage of dumb people is one of the greatest sins.
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  And I don't need to be a Christian to know that.
[37:04.000 --> 37:10.000]  My soul shakes with disgust.
[37:10.000 --> 37:13.000]  Because it's so unhealthy to have that type of attitude.
[37:13.000 --> 37:16.000]  It's so bad. It's so wicked.
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  I know the old saying, the big fish eat the little fish.
[37:20.000 --> 37:27.000]  And the globalists have bought under this pure social Darwinistic view that whatever evil they do to us, it's okay because they're in charge.
[37:27.000 --> 37:28.000]  That means they're the fittest.
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  No, cancer is not the fittest.
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.000]  It destroys the body.
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  It destroys the host.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  You are perocytes.
[37:37.000 --> 37:38.000]  You are not alphas.
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  Alphas lead because they're strong.
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  And they have the greatest ideas.
[37:42.000 --> 37:43.000]  And they are admired.
[37:43.000 --> 37:44.000]  They lead by example.
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  And they lift up the weakest.
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  Perocytes bring down the strongest and the weakest.
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.000]  And you bring the weak down to a level of destruction.
[37:53.000 --> 37:56.000]  And then the next group becomes the weak and you bring them down.
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  And it implodes systems.
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  That will not get us to alpha centuries.
[38:01.000 --> 38:07.000]  That will not get us past the type one civilization that we haven't even reached yet.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  My goal is to win.
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  And you know, the globalists, they think generationally.
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  They think multi-generationally.
[38:14.000 --> 38:15.000]  They think long term.
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  They teach us to think minute to minute.
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  But they don't think minute to minute.
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.000]  They think decade to century.
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  They think out into the future.
[38:24.000 --> 38:25.000]  They're following a plan.
[38:25.000 --> 38:28.000]  We can beat them because we have the plan.
[38:28.000 --> 38:29.000]  And the plan has a lot of faults.
[38:29.000 --> 38:30.000]  It's an old plan.
[38:30.000 --> 38:36.000]  It's strong because they don't leave the plan, but it's weak because they don't vary the plan.
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  You understand that?
[38:38.000 --> 38:44.000]  And okay, let's break this down because I got a lot of other news I need to get to.
[38:44.000 --> 38:50.000]  Imagine you're driving along in your car and you hear people that you've eaten with,
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  you know, had drinks with over the years gone to comedy clubs with.
[38:53.000 --> 38:58.000]  You don't agree with them politically, but you hear the snickering and the laughing about,
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  you know, dead babies and bloody babies and beauty pageants for dead babies.
[39:02.000 --> 39:07.000]  And then you know that you'll be the square because you are repulsed by that.
[39:07.000 --> 39:12.000]  You are bad when you read the Daily Mail or the Associated Press.
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.000]  Doctors should have right to kill unwanted or disabled babies at birth,
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.000]  as they are not a real person claims Oxford academic.
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  And it's actually in a prestigious journal.
[39:22.000 --> 39:27.000]  Now Watson at info wars.com, he broke that a few months ago and the others picked it up,
[39:27.000 --> 39:32.000]  which is my point is at first people thought the report was fake,
[39:32.000 --> 39:39.000]  even though we were linking to it by the big prestigious bioethics paper publication.
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  But this is what Peter Singer says.
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.000]  He's the top guy over at Princeton saying bioethics saying big animal rights guys,
[39:46.000 --> 39:50.000]  not about animals rights is about saying you're scum is that humans are trash.
[39:50.000 --> 39:51.000]  Humans are ugly.
[39:51.000 --> 39:54.000]  A baby has no more value than a mackerel.
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.000]  That you should be able to get rid of your children if you want to.
[39:59.000 --> 40:05.000]  It's this idea that we're below the animals, not just on par with them.
[40:05.000 --> 40:10.000]  So I'm driving in my car and this needs to become a major story,
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.000]  because it's not just the Democrats trying to send back the fruit baskets
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.000]  and saying we don't want God put back in the respect for religion,
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  put back on the democratic platform.
[40:20.000 --> 40:27.000]  Even if you don't like establishment religion, it's the frothing hate for people of faith
[40:27.000 --> 40:33.000]  and the disdain by these people who themselves have their own weird cultural religions
[40:33.000 --> 40:36.000]  of materialism or thinking they're part of an elite club
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  when most of these so-called liberals aren't very intelligent.
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  Chris Hedges is a smart liberal.
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  People like Joel Stein are not.
[40:44.000 --> 40:51.000]  He's there to culturally scar your mind where you'll just accept anything.
[40:51.000 --> 40:55.000]  See, when you stand for something, that gets in the way of them running over you.
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.000]  When you've got a rudder, that means they can't just push you wherever they want.
[40:59.000 --> 41:04.000]  Time Magazine writer jokes about dead fetuses, beauty pageant at RNC.
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  This has now been picked up by Lifesight and some others.
[41:06.000 --> 41:13.000]  All they do is read scripture and have giant pictures of dead fetuses.
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.000]  And he went on to say, like a servant of protestors as they do,
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.000]  all they do is read the Bible, all they do is read scripture and have giant, giant pictures of dead fetuses.
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  Time responding.
[41:24.000 --> 41:29.000]  I've seen so many bloody fetuses that I can literally tell good-looking fetuses from ugly fetuses.
[41:29.000 --> 41:34.000]  You're now making fun of a dead human that never had a chance to be loved by its mommy or its daddy
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.000]  or see butterflies flying around, never had a chance to run around
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  with a little feet pattering on the floor and never had a chance.
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.000]  You just see them as ugly. You say my species is ugly.
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.000]  You say humanity is ugly. I say you're ugly.
[41:45.000 --> 41:50.000]  Continuing, I've seen so many bloody fetuses that I can literally...
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.000]  And I've seen so many. You're in here. It's so funny. You're funny.
[41:55.000 --> 42:00.000]  You're a bully on a bully little baby in the womb where they think they're safe chopping them up
[42:00.000 --> 42:03.000]  and they're sucking their thumb.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  Make me sick.
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.000]  I've seen so many bloody fetuses that I can literally tell good-looking fetuses from ugly fetuses,
[42:09.000 --> 42:12.000]  I've added much of the amusement of the host.
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.000]  Stein then suggests that the dead fetuses should be entered into a beauty pageant.
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  We're going to play the clip for you right here.
[42:18.000 --> 42:23.000]  And it's... I don't even hate this guy.
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  I cringe to think of being this person.
[42:25.000 --> 42:30.000]  I just thank God every morning I was born to a good, decent, loving family.
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.000]  Who weren't perfect, but, you know, people like this guy are a mile wide, not even an inch deep.
[42:35.000 --> 42:42.000]  And I'm just so thankful that I had a decent upbringing and that I came from loving people.
[42:42.000 --> 42:50.000]  I just cannot imagine being this type of self-propelled demon walking around on the surface of the earth.
[42:50.000 --> 42:55.000]  I mean, look, if you want to kill babies, we're going to try to outlaw it and stop it.
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.000]  And if you make excuses and say it isn't human and know it's your decision and, you know, there's...
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.000]  But, you know, it's still a grim thing. I can just say you're wrong.
[43:03.000 --> 43:07.000]  I'll forgive you later if you admit you were wrong.
[43:07.000 --> 43:15.000]  But to just... The ultimate sin is to revel in the destruction of the innocent and to know it's bad and to get off on it.
[43:15.000 --> 43:21.000]  So, we can use people like Joel Stein, though, to illustrate this.
[43:21.000 --> 43:23.000]  So, get this article out to everybody.
[43:23.000 --> 43:25.000]  It already scrolled off the main page of infowars.com.
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.000]  I'm going to ask the guys in there to red-link it right now.
[43:29.000 --> 43:41.000]  Here is some of the unmitigated evil, because it's all just done like it's fun. It's fun time.
[43:41.000 --> 43:46.000]  Let's make jokes. Imagine making jokes about, hey, hey, hey, Joel.
[43:46.000 --> 43:49.000]  How about if you made jokes about a beauty pageant of...
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.000]  Guys, can we pull up piles of dead Jews in concentration camps?
[43:53.000 --> 43:56.000]  Horrible with their eyeballs eaten out by crows. You've seen those.
[43:56.000 --> 43:59.000]  There's even color footage of it, color film. Hey, Joel Stein.
[43:59.000 --> 44:05.000]  What would happen if somebody came out and said, let's have a beauty pageant of dead Jews?
[44:05.000 --> 44:10.000]  Oh, boy, the media would get upset about that, but not little babies.
[44:10.000 --> 44:14.000]  See, what if we had a beauty pageant about dead soccer moms?
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.000]  Well, I guess they already do do that. See, this is a whole culture of death being sold on us.
[44:18.000 --> 44:22.000]  Let's go ahead and play this clip. Here it is.
[44:22.000 --> 44:28.000]  And then after we play that clip, we will be able to...
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.000]  Stop right there. Stop right there.
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  Because for hours before the show, we got this queued up and ready.
[44:34.000 --> 44:40.000]  I want to queue it back up to the exact spot, and I want to play this here on air, because this is important.
[44:40.000 --> 44:58.000]  Okay? You guys, tell me when you're ready.
[44:58.000 --> 45:04.000]  Again, we'll just sit here until we're ready with this clip. Doesn't matter how long it takes, it's going to air.
[45:04.000 --> 45:08.000]  All I got to do is queue it back up where we had it.
[45:08.000 --> 45:12.000]  God help me. I just don't know what to do anymore.
[45:12.000 --> 45:19.000]  I care a lot because I understand we're going into purity humanization, and I just don't understand.
[45:19.000 --> 45:23.000]  I wanted this clip. I asked yesterday morning for people to get this week.
[45:23.000 --> 45:26.000]  All day, I wanted to play it. I can't even play it now.
[45:26.000 --> 45:32.000]  When you're ready, just tell me, guys.
[45:32.000 --> 45:39.000]  Weirdos. Combined. In other words, the freakiest, craziest things you've heard.
[45:39.000 --> 45:42.000]  Are you counting protesters?
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  Sure. The freakiest, craziest stuff has been in which convention?
[45:45.000 --> 45:50.000]  I would think it would be the DNC, because the DNC is letting the protesters be a little closer, aren't they?
[45:50.000 --> 45:58.000]  They are, but the Republican or the conservative protesters, all they do is read the Bible.
[45:58.000 --> 46:05.000]  They only do two things. The liberal protesters just rant and chat.
[46:05.000 --> 46:08.000]  I don't know what they're talking about. They don't make any sense at all.
[46:08.000 --> 46:16.000]  But the conservative ones, all they do is read scripture and have giant, giant pictures of bloody fetuses.
[46:16.000 --> 46:19.000]  I actually read that online.
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  24 years.
[46:21.000 --> 46:24.000]  The giant posters of dead fetuses.
[46:24.000 --> 46:31.000]  I've seen so many bloody fetuses that I can literally tell good-looking fetuses from ugly fetuses.
[46:31.000 --> 46:39.000]  I want to walk around and pick a misfetus.
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  Dude, you're getting us in trouble.
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.000]  No, you're doing a great job.
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  That's great.
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.000]  What's on tap tonight? How close will you be for the president's speech?
[46:51.000 --> 46:59.000]  Well, first of all, honestly, again, I've been denied these. Democrats, logistically, cannot run a convention.
[46:59.000 --> 47:01.000]  No, idiotic.
[47:01.000 --> 47:04.000]  They just, you know, it's the whole...
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  Again, good job to the crew getting that.
[47:06.000 --> 47:10.000]  I asked Watson to get a yesh train. It's in some weird podcast format that's hard to get.
[47:10.000 --> 47:14.000]  Then I just said, hell, put a camera on screen and videotape the damn things we can play it.
[47:14.000 --> 47:17.000]  And then it was ready to play and wouldn't.
[47:17.000 --> 47:23.000]  But there you go, ladies and gentlemen, it's all real funny.
[47:23.000 --> 47:26.000]  And God help us.
[47:26.000 --> 47:32.000]  I mean, we're being taught that human life's worthless, and it's all funny to these people.
[47:32.000 --> 47:38.000]  They're just going to go on and on and on rubbing our face today, and I frankly have had enough of it.
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.000]  I got some other really horrible news today.
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  People are like, well, don't be so negative.
[47:43.000 --> 47:48.000]  We're not going to turn this around if we don't start recognizing evil when we see it and calling it out.
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.000]  We've gotten where we're at because we're so compliant.
[47:51.000 --> 47:58.000]  It's a type of sick American hospitality where now we ask the government to come in and the bureaucrats
[47:58.000 --> 48:05.000]  and all the scum media and just run our lives and rub our faces in and dominate us.
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.000]  And I think the one thing this show has given people is the courage to stand up against the thugs and the globalists.
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.000]  And if you don't have courage to stand up against them, you give the world to them.
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  I'm afraid of them winning.
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  I'm afraid of them taking over.
[48:19.000 --> 48:31.000]  So I fight them, not from a position of courage, from a position of survival.
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  I don't even know what to say at this point.
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  We've lost our spirit.
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.000]  We've lost our capacity to even be human.
[48:39.000 --> 48:49.000]  Because we've let a bunch of dehumanized demons take over and tell us that we should act like them and be like them.
[48:49.000 --> 48:52.000]  They tell us that we should eat GMO. They don't eat GMO.
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  They tell us we should take vaccines. They don't take vaccines.
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.000]  It's on record that the world leaders don't take vaccines.
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.000]  It's come out in the news that they don't eat GMO, that they don't drink fluoride water.
[49:03.000 --> 49:09.000]  Hydrofacilic acid. Don't confuse it with calcium fluoride. You actually need some of it.
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  They play on your ignorance. They feed off of it.
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.000]  Here's an example of Spring-Ted Anderson up for the end of this segment and the next one.
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  Head of Lillian LaRouge and a lot more.
[49:17.000 --> 49:20.000]  And I've got some Barton Springs news. We live here in Austin. They're going to shut it down.
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  Never done this before. They're going to shut it down.
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  I just discovered that today and found that out.
[49:26.000 --> 49:32.000]  But I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up because we've got all these world leaders buying gold right now in the last month.
[49:32.000 --> 49:37.000]  And we said, well, that means if George Soros and all these elites and big banks and universities and the Russian government,
[49:37.000 --> 49:43.000]  the Indian government, the Chinese government, if they're all running into gold, well, they know the QE3 is coming.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  Ted, tell us what's coming up after the break.
[49:45.000 --> 49:51.000]  Well, I tell you what. I mean, I'm looking at George Soros' face here and listen to you talk about babies being murdered.
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  And I'm like, I'm getting sick to my stomach.
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  But here's this title right here is a big headline.
[49:57.000 --> 50:02.000]  He sells dump stocks and buys $130 million in gold.
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.000]  You know, these guys know what's going on. The QE3 is coming.
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.000]  It's not only is it coming, quite a lot. It's happening right now in Europe. That's what all this is about.
[50:09.000 --> 50:14.000]  It's more like a combination of tarp and QE3 all tied together to make a hybrid.
[50:14.000 --> 50:18.000]  I mean, the price of gold is reflecting it. This is happening.
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  I mean, if you want to deny it, deny it.
[50:20.000 --> 50:27.000]  But I can tell you right now, we're looking at gold going up again, $35 an ounce for at $17.3780 now.
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.000]  You know, with this kind of momentum, $2,000 gold will seem like history real fast.
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  You know, silver right now is at $33.72.
[50:35.000 --> 50:41.000]  I mean, there's a lot of stuff that's going on in the gold in silver market, Alex.
[50:41.000 --> 50:48.000]  We're going to be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this quick break with Ted Anderson to go over more of this.
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.000]  The elites are buying gold, but they tell you not to.
[50:51.000 --> 50:57.000]  They don't have abortions for their kids, but they tell you to, and you run out and get it because Laura Steinem says it's cool.
[50:57.000 --> 51:21.000]  I say buy gold. Hold it back.
[51:27.000 --> 51:51.000]  We're going to be right back.
[51:51.000 --> 52:00.000]  We're going to be right back.
[52:21.000 --> 52:39.000]  We, the people, grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[52:39.000 --> 52:46.000]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public currency, is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.
[52:46.000 --> 52:53.000]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book, explains our monetary system. Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[52:53.000 --> 52:59.000]  It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[52:59.000 --> 53:07.000]  My name is Frank Bates, and I've got some urgent news for you. Did you know that a solar storm in 1989 caused an enormous blackout in Quebec?
[53:07.000 --> 53:15.000]  Here's the really bad news. Experts are predicting that solar storms will get really severe over the next year, and our electric grid is extremely vulnerable.
[53:15.000 --> 53:24.000]  In fact, the Wall Street Journal reported that we could soon face blackouts lasting weeks or months, leaving major parts of the USA temporarily uninhabitable.

[54:17.000 --> 54:32.000]  All right, Ted, go over some of the headlines you've got there. I mean, the who's who are out there in the news buying gold, the Indian government's buying gold, and then they've got their economists telling poor Indians don't buy gold,
[54:32.000 --> 54:40.000]  because the globalists obviously want to hoard gold themselves while using paper to try to suppress the price. Why is that, Ted?
[54:40.000 --> 54:57.000]  Well, because they want to continue to keep us the common man in paper. That's the game. You realize that the Federal Reserve system, the banks in Japan, the banks in all the central banks, they're in the business of creating paper and having the people use that paper as money.
[54:57.000 --> 55:07.000]  If the people no longer accept the paper, their game is over. They no longer can profit from it. They no longer can control the masses. I mean, they really need to keep us in paper.
[55:07.000 --> 55:15.000]  That's why they want that. They'll push and they'll try to keep people out of gold. They'll do everything they can to manipulate that. At the same time, you can read the headlines.
[55:15.000 --> 55:25.000]  What are the central banks doing with their own resources? They're putting it in the gold. So guess what? They're trying to convince you to stay away from gold and silver. They're telling you why.
[55:25.000 --> 55:38.000]  Like, for instance, I'm looking at a big old picture of George Soros. Looks like he's standing on top of the world and it says, why buying gold after Paulson and Soros is foolished? Well, Soros is buying the gold because he knows what's going on.
[55:38.000 --> 55:46.000]  He's an insider. He can see it. There's no question about it. We're going to see the value of paper money go down because of the fact that there's so many problems.
[55:46.000 --> 55:57.000]  Exactly. Here's the bottom line. This is obviously a gold pitch because, again, it's very simple. We are self-financed. We promote what we use, what we believe in. I buy my gold and silver from Mitus Resources.
[55:57.000 --> 56:07.000]  In bullion, gold and silver, you can't beat the prices. They have very competitive on numismatics as well. But bottom line, Ted then also helps get the word out.
[56:07.000 --> 56:20.000]  So you vote with your dollars. You get a great deal on gold and silver from somebody who supports liberty. But the issue here is, Ted Anderson has been buying gold when it was at 1670 and things.
[56:20.000 --> 56:31.000]  And now he's going to be able to sell you that gold until it runs out, even though it's at, let me hit refresh, 1730 something last time I looked.
[56:31.000 --> 56:48.000]  Yes, it's 1736 right now with the system trying to drive it down. But it's the talk of QE3, the global devaluation, Moody saying Europe's going to basically go under, the new ECB megabond plan that ends the sovereignty of the nations by bankruptcy.
[56:48.000 --> 56:58.000]  This is all there. That's why I believe, that's why I am in silver and gold. That's why I was completely confident when gold was dropped down some to not sell any of it.
[56:58.000 --> 57:09.000]  Because my gut tells me it's only going up. Now, you know, are Easter Bunny real? Maybe. The point is, is that I don't get it, you know, as an investment, but it could go down someday.
[57:09.000 --> 57:21.000]  Who knows anything's possible. Again, leprechauns could be real. But everything points towards devaluation. So you can call Midas Resources, the parent company of the GCN radio network or sister company.
[57:21.000 --> 57:29.000]  Certainly the parent, though it helped fund and create it. They're two tandems. So to be technical, it's not a subsidiary. It's a sister.
[57:29.000 --> 57:38.000]  But the point is, I get caught in my new show folks, you know, I do that. The issue here is Ted's got a big list of gold and silver that is bullion.
[57:38.000 --> 57:49.000]  A lot of it actually collectible at bullion prices. It's the Alex Jones radio specials. You've got to ask about those when you call to get even more competitive rates than what they have at MidasResources.com,
[57:49.000 --> 58:02.000]  which already has very competitive special deals for the Internet. So 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237. Give Ted Anderson and his great brokers there a call.
[58:02.000 --> 58:08.000]  Tell them you want the Alex Jones specials. They can also tell you about some of the other specials they've got. But we've got about 30 seconds left, Ted.
[58:08.000 --> 58:14.000]  800-686-237. What are some of the best deals you've got right now on gold and silver?
[58:14.000 --> 58:24.000]  Well, if I have 30 seconds, the $63 for the two silver dollars, the book and the DVD, that is a steal because silver just went up another $2 an ounce. You're getting it for less than cost.
[58:24.000 --> 58:32.000]  How long until you have to go up on prices with gold up over 50 bucks right now in the last few days? How long until you've got to go up on prices?
[58:32.000 --> 58:37.000]  I only have a little bit of supply left and people are calling, so you can pretty much guess that it's going to end today.
[58:37.000 --> 58:38.000]  All right.
[58:38.000 --> 58:47.000]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[59:08.000 --> 59:18.000]  These are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth. There's no priming required. It's NSF 42 certified. Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[59:18.000 --> 59:24.000]  Easy to set up and use. Doesn't require electricity. Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[59:24.000 --> 59:32.000]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key. Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[59:32.000 --> 59:39.000]  Propyr is the best gravity-fed filter out there. It's what my family uses. Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Propyr.
[59:39.000 --> 59:45.000]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[59:45.000 --> 01:00:03.000]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, in this short segment, I'm going to cover an issue near and dear to my heart. But similar things to this are happening around the country.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  Government likes to dominate and take things over. A national treasure is in Austin, Texas. It's giant, 68-degree mineral-rich springs that blast out of the rock.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  In Native Americans, it was a sacred place. Spanish explorers camped out there. For 500 years of known history, western history, it's been used by Europeans.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  It's Barton Springs. And I've been so busy over the years, I haven't had a chance to use it a lot, but I've started making myself go and swim a few days a week.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  And this morning, it was the strangest thing. I was just thinking, man, I can't believe the government that's dedicated to ruining everything good hadn't put TSA here or something or hasn't shut this down.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  And all of a sudden, I was finishing my mild swim. I had to hurry back and get back to the office. And all of a sudden, I see six, seven construction-type bureaucrats and city people come in and they're looking down in the water.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  I mean, it looks like the Caribbean in the morning there. We're talking like 20 feet deep in areas. Ocean eels come up to Colorado just to live there. There's like four-foot eels in there.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  And I get up and I go over and I listen to them because nobody dare talk to people wearing hard hats and stuff. There's no construction going on, but they're all wearing vest, nanny-state hard hats.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  They've got the Austin Aquatics head person there. They're pointing on the water. And because alumni from UT, we have all the articles here, Aaron, because alumni from UT, it turns out two years ago, didn't like the fact there was little cracks here and there in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s cement on the side,
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  which is totally structurally sound. They were admitting that. Some little rebar down on the bottom where they paved an area of it back in the 40s.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  It's just some little rebar. It's just patching it or something. They are going to drain it. They wanted to eat for a year.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  Then it was being nine months, then six months. They're going to now, and I go over and I listen to them and they're going, yeah, we're shutting it down October 1st.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  They have the plans all pulled out. And I'm listening. That's called spying. But I mean, I'm just right there hearing it all.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  And I go up and talk to the manager and they go, no, no, they'll be a riot. No, no, no, they won't tell us what they're planning.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  And I go, no, they're right down there now. Go down there. They're right down there saying they're going to shut it down until next summer, maybe longer.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  And they're going to tear everything out and drain it down to one foot. The eels will die, everything. Forget the stupid salamanders.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  There's plenty of those. That's all made up. And there's the baster all eating them. There's like two foot bass in there. They're going to drain it, annihilate it.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  All because the UT Richie Riches don't want to see some old concrete that looks awesome. It looks awesome.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  My little feet patterned on that when I was a baby. And we only got a few minutes left. We'll have you have you back on about this.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  But I had you go double check it this morning. You found the Daily Texan. They're going to shut it down for nine months. Tell us about it.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  Well, they have one plan for nine months. They say specifically it's going to be closed for sure in October and all winter long, completely shut down.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  They're going to let just in October, the deep end be open. But they've tacked on hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars to deal with the environmental issue of the salamanders.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  Who's really getting all that money is probably a bigger question. But it's a big infrastructure boondoggle.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  And people probably don't know from around the country that water is great year round. People swim in there all year round.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  Well, yeah, because when it's cold outside, all of a sudden the cold water is warm. Yeah, it's bizarre.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  And you know what, little arousia is coming up. But at the next little five minutes segment at the start of the next hour, we'll come back in and you could actually go over it.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  The point is, they use ignorance. Because when I walked over and said, really, you're closing in October and he goes, well, I didn't say that officially.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  And then I found out other than this article from two years ago, they've never wanted anybody to know.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  So the people running the pool don't know because they don't want the slaves finding out and saying, they go, well, it's a safety issue.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  I go, what, is it going to collapse? No, no. But there's some rebar down there. Why don't you just patch that?
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  That's from them in the 40s trying to pave the bottom of it. We don't want the bottom of it paved. They're idiots.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  Yeah, it's great there. But they've been planning this project, I guess, somewhat secretly for three years.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  Well, that's because three years ago, people said we don't want it. And so now they're going to sneak attack again.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  That's true. These governments do not service. Why don't you all just go out to your farm and the one we're paying for, you know, taxpayers pay for and get out of Austin,
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  and Lee Lettingwell and all you scum and all you UT alumni, richie riches, those women, you're swimming pools.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  That's in the mainstream news every day. Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  pushing the grid beyond its capacity. I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling power hub unit.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make. It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar powered. That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at beattheblackouts.com. That's beattheblackouts.com.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  See them on the web at fivestarsope.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  Buy the one to two month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  Or save big with a one to two year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs. This is an amazing deal.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.

[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods direct now.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods direct because we've all known this was coming.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  You know about their delicious long term storeable foods. The fact is you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  And because it's stored for 25 years, they're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  So don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  You can bet your life on eFoods direct.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen. For the balance of the hour, we're going to be joined by Lyndon LaRouche here in a moment.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  If you don't know who he is, look into who he really is, none of the media says he is.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  Very interesting person with an amazing historical perspective. And I hear he's got a birthday. Has he already had it or is it tomorrow?
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  We're going to find out from the man himself. I guess I could go to Wikipedia and find out, but so much of what they say is wrong.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  We're going to be having Lyndon LaRouche on here in just a moment from his offices to break down what's happening in the world.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  And here's just an example. UN armed intervention may be necessary in Syria.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  That is a official UN press release. Well, there already is armed intervention.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  The West has been sending in al Qaeda and others, and that is now admitted. What we told you eight months ago when the latest things started.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  We told you a year and a half ago the Libya thing was started as a pretext.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  And now Iran is sending elite troops to aid Al-Assad's regime in Syria.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  That's the London Telegraph and that's official out of Iran as well.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  So this is a full blown proxy war, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  Barak hints the U.S. would join Israel in Iran's strike.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  We share the challenge through our timetables. They're not the same.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  The Defense Minister says a pre-Rashishana political event.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  Defense Minister Ehud Barak appeared to hint last night that he believed the United States would join Israel in a strike on Iran to prevent the Islamic Republic from obtaining nuclear weapons.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  So it's all moving towards that. Israel says differences remain between U.S. and Iran.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  That's Fox News. Canada closes embassy in Iran. That's a big sign.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  Intelligence committee chair describes explosive confrontation between Netanyahu and American ambassador, complete with yelling and screaming at each other.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  Venezuela grabs U.S. ships and has arms. That's Forbes.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  The point is things are going into hypergear.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  Obama's talking about signing an executive order right now to go ahead and have the Pentagon take over the Internet.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  Even CBS News says it's draconian, anti-free speech.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  I mean, when they're saying that, you know you're in trouble.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  All of this is happening and in the backdrop, Europe has been downgraded by Moody's to negative outlook.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  They're coming out with a super bond that'll just put people more into debt to the oligarch banks.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  All of this is happening and that's why we've got Lyndon LaRouche joining us.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  Because, well, he was called by, you can look this up.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  I remember hearing this a couple of years ago when he looked it up as in the Washington Post. It was true.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  The CIA director back in the 80s called him the best intelligence, private intelligence, operation of the world, national security council, members said similar things.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  He used to land for weekly meetings himself by helicopter at the CIA command center.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  Ronald Reagan read his information and people got jealous.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  George Herbert Walker had him set up and put in prison.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  I mean, just amazing the type of stuff that they do.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  And it doesn't mean that I agree with all of Lyndon LaRouche's solutions, but his historical perspective is dead on.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  And the more I learn in my own research, the more I learn how right he is, which has become a big media event, that Jones is a LaRouchean.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  And what I am is a seeker of truth. That's what I'm seeking out.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  And that's why he's here with us.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  And sir, I hear that you are just about 90 years old.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  If you count nine months and your mother's womb, I guess over 90.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  But I tell you, you don't look a day above 75. What's your secret to longevity?
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  I don't know. Maybe there's some virtue there somewhere or some reward for something I had done or not done.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  I just enjoy doing what I do. I feel committed to what I'm doing.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  What is your birthday? Is it today or tomorrow?
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  Tomorrow is tomorrow.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  Wow, so you'll be 90 years old on September 8th.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  Yep.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  Well, happy birthday.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  Thank you.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  No one can say that you've sat around on your hind end for 90 years.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  No.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  A lot of other places, but not that.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  Wow. Let's get into world events first.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  I do want to speak a little bit about Lenin LaRouche today and also open the phones up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  People that have questions or comments for you.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  But I mean, I just read over just a snapshot of news today.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  I mean, I see the world lining up like we saw before the first two world wars.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  Am I wrong in intellectually, historically, but also in my gut, feeling the serious tremors in the force?
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  I think there are only two major sources of threat.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  One is the British monarchy and the other is the British monarchy's puppet, which is Obama.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  The situation is that as the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States have shown,
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  they understand that any war that breaks out now, such as in the Middle East or elsewhere, will be a thermonuclear war.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  There may be other minor things and conflicts which are going on.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  But any time the force comes in and someone says we're going to start the attack,
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  it's going to be a full global attack and it's going to be thermonuclear.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  And the question is, will anybody survive eventually, not merely out of the war?
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  Because you forget the Soviet of Russia and Chinese capabilities, which are very significant.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  And against the United States and Britain and something from France, which is the other side.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  And these forces are going to go against each other on a thermonuclear basis from the get-go.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  And that means that our submarines, our major submarines, are going to launch in their time.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  It's going to be a full launch, probably one or two rounds.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  Maybe with an hour and a half it's all over and the world looks pretty dead.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  So we're at a point where the idea of simple war, a war breaking out or incidents leading to war, is not going to happen.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  What's happened is Russia and China have made a very firm commitment not to start a war but to defend against it.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  Most people in the United States want no part of this.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  The only person really behind it is the President, Obama.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  And Obama's with the Queen, but most of the people in Britain are not for this nonsense either.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  So we're on the verge of the worst kind of warfare one could imagine, which would break out very suddenly,
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  with very little warning on any part.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  Certain services, such as the U.S. services, would understand and know that this is going on immediately.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  Let me stop you there, sir, because what you're saying is obviously right on target,
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  but people may not understand the last two chairman of the Joint Chiefs,
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  the last three heads of CENTCOM, as you know, people can look this up, journalists can look this up,
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  have refused to attack Iran, saying it would bring in China and Russia.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  Now they've sent the fleets over to men of China and they think that that's going to allow this attack,
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  but now even Dempsey, who's been known as not as smart as his predecessors, has been convinced and came out, as you know,
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  last week and said, hey, I mean the exact quote it was a headline was, do not blame us when Israel strikes and don't think we're supporting it.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  So that type, I mean to have Chairman of the Joint Chiefs saying that, shows that the military establishment who love wars,
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  I mean that's what they do, I mean they love to be commanded off the war generally, are saying do not do this.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  I mean how significant is that? That signifies a mutiny within the saner sectors of the power structure.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  I'm not sure the word mutiny is the right term.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  The point is because nothing that the Joint Chiefs and others are doing to that effect is a violation of anything on their spot.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  Sure, I mean that's the wrong term, it's a sanity call, it's a, what would you call it then?
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  I probably, the point is you've got to throw this president out of office, even though he's just been nominated,
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  I don't think it's going to stick and he's not in a winning position right now.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  But what does it mean inside the government where you have so many connections to have the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs come out
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  and say something countervailing what the president and certain sectors of Israel are pushing?
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  Yeah, but the Joint Chiefs are operating within their powers of government and the president doesn't dare challenge that directly
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  because the president is not a popular president.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  Am I right to say that it's seismic though? I mean how big of a deal is it to have the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs come out,
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  say that and it gets almost no press?
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  You're talking about if you're a member of the Joint Chiefs and you're a patriot as I am,
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  you're not going to play games and guessing games or anything with this policy.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  We know that any major war that breaks out on this planet will be a thermonuclear war.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  There are no minor wars possible. You cannot have a continuation of the war with the Middle East at all.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  Any such war will lead to thermonuclear war immediately and that means that within about an hour and a half,
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  most of the world is dead.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  And anyone who is competent like the Joint Chiefs or other people of the same interest,
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  of Russians or Chinese, all the same thing, this war must not occur.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  And if somebody tries to start it, we should get them out of the way quick because if we let this war happen,
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  because we're in the age of thermonuclear warfare and nobody can win thermonuclear warfare,
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  the human race might go extinct within the aftermath of such an attack.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  So no sane person, and I wouldn't include this president as sane,
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  no sane person wants to start such a war.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  There are other means we're going to have to use to deal with conflict.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  Many of the means are not conflict at all.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  They're just arguments about how we're going to settle things.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  But we've come to a time where we have to learn the truth.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  You cannot have war among major nations today.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  No sane head of government will launch it.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  But I think there are some people who are not so sane, including our current president.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  But don't assume that with all the boula-boula that he's going to win this election.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  Now he's running as a loser, not because the other guys are smart, but because he is so bad.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  And he's losing anything resembling friends and supporters at a rapid rate.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  Again, you have a lot of connections inside the Pentagon, CIA, you name it.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  I want to get their take on where this is going, other October surprises that this regime could pull,
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  and how we do avert kicking off a wider war in the Middle East.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000]  The big proxy war is already on.

[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  Hi there. My name is Frank Bates.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  Incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  This is a conspiracy. Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  But again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  I hope we don't have a nuclear war so I can still go out and hear people like Jimmy Vaughan play.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  Alright, going back now to Lennon LaRouge who is with us for the balance of the hour.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  Very honored to have him. The toll-free number to join us if you've got any questions or comments for him coming up in the next segment, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, are 800-259-9231.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  First-time callers for Lennon LaRouge, 800-2599-231.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  Lennon, again, with all of your sources, I remember you were on a couple of years ago when you said it was building up to this.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  Now we're here. The power structure that thinks it can have this war, that's trying to overthrow Russia with proxy groups and political groups, the George Soros types.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  What do they think they're doing? Because then I have neocon groups come out and say, I'm bad and anti-American because I don't want to have war and I'm not supporting Obama.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  So it's elements of the conservative groups and the so-called Obama people. I mean, I'm bad, you're bad because we don't want to have a giant war that even the top military in the news said will probably lead to a war with Russia or China.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  I mean, how are we bad for not wanting World War III?
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  Well, the point is, I think that the powers that be are really do not intend to have a thermonuclear war. They intend to have a limited kind of conflict, hope that they can break up resistance and take over and then kill people.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  Now the best way to kill people is being done in the United States by those interests who have shut off the food supply, those who are insisting like this president on cutting out food consumption in an area where we are going running short of the food necessary to meet people and he's trying to turn it into gasoline or something of that sort.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  It's the attempt to use bluff, threats, even terrible threats, exemplary cruelties, these kinds of things, trying to break the will of nation after nation the way we unconstitutionally got into a war in Libya, which was a violation of our Constitution.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  And it's that wear and tear process working on people's nerves and trying to derive them, intimidate them and so forth.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  And the problem we have here is you see it in the election campaign.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  Now Obama is not winning the election right now.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  Now I don't know what's going to happen in the future, that's a different matter.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  But the point, the game is the bluff, intimidation, bluff, threats, the murders he's, you know, in the Middle East, the daily weekly murders this president is doing, without any constitutional authorization for it.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  So what you're seeing here is you're seeing a few people who are using the method of bluff to intimidate if we ever got our act together in the United States, for example, we would have him out of there right away.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  And that can be done very quickly.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  We have the evidence to throw him out of office.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  And with the problem we have a weakness in the Republican side on this thing as well as the problems on the Democratic side.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  Well, as you point out, Congressman Jones from North Carolina has introduced the legislation to begin the impeachment.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  Obama says that NATO and other groups command our military and that Congress should just sit down and shut up.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  Well, I think the truth of the matter is that there are some of us in the United States who are influential.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  And actually, as you know, there are a limited number of people who are really influential in the sense that they can push things in a direction which is, say, positive or the other way.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  And it's a limited number of people.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  The rest of them tend to follow pressures put upon them.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  And I think we're at the point that the really responsible layers in the United States, apart from the very much frightened and quiet one, remember, the poverty of our people, the suffering of our people is beyond anything.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  This is worse than the great depression.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  And our people are suffering this under this President in particular.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:29:01.000]  I mean, the deliberate action by him in cutting down the food supply in order to make more gasoline, in order to starve farmers and others to death, that's the kind of thing you're dealing with right now.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  And if we get our act together as a nation, together with other nations who you may not like, but will cooperate with us on this, that cooperation can settle this matter.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  The problem is we haven't gotten that organized well enough together right now.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  Amazing, Len LaRouche is our guest and you can also visit their website, larouchepac.com or also larouchepub.com. Len LaRouche will be with us on the other side to take phone calls.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  Before we do that, I want to ask him what else is front and center on his radar.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  I've got some articles from their site I want to go over.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  And I want to look at the economy in more detail.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  The state of the economy, what's happening with the euro, where he sees the dollar going straight ahead.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  The NSF-42 certified optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000]  Easy to set up and use, doesn't require electricity.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.000]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.

[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:16.000]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:48.000]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:33:08.000]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:23.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  Well, he turns Night Amara, Lyndon LaRouche and he is with us on the line.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  Right now your phone calls are coming up.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:42.000]  Lyndon, finishing up with all of your contacts in the Defense Department, in the CIA, everywhere else,
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  and even the Washington Post admits you have amazing contacts.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  And you were here over a year ago saying that the military didn't want to do this
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  and so much of what you've talked about has now come out in mainstream media.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  So tell us what else is going on from your contacts that we're not aware of,
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  that we don't know about, that's happening inside of the power structure?
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  Well, it does take the things that don't get discussed in one way or the other,
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  at least not in a significant way.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  Let's take the case of curiosity.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  We launched a successful flight of this instrument to Mars
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  and that may seem just like something very spectacular.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  It got a lot of support from people, a lot of sympathy.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  It was done in defiance of Obama and that's important.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  Now the issue here is this.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  The problems we're talking about on politics are not so much the real issues for the long term.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  The great danger that we're facing is the danger from rocks in space.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.000]  Now this issue has been around for a long time.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  Edward Teller, the famous Edward Teller who is now deceased,
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  was a key sponsor of this effort to deal with this problem.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  It is an actual serious threat to mankind.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  Now we have over periods of time, we have these giant rocks hitting different parts of the planet
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  and taking out areas such as the equivalent of entire city areas, metropolitan cities, things like that.
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  But once in a while you get in the history of mankind,
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  not in terms of living history of mankind but of the territory,
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  you get a one big rock hits the earth and everybody on earth dies
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  or everything on earth tends to die, may come back later.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  So we're now at a point where the key issue before us in terms of defense of nations
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  is the defense of earth from these rocks
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  and the increase of the danger of that source is notable.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  So therefore we've got to do something about it.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  And what happened was by putting this thing over the president's strongest objections
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  to put this thing on Mars, on Curiosity, on Mars,
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  we set into place an absolutely indispensable mechanism
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  by which at the speed of light, which is the communication between us and Mars,
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  we can determine things and make decisions and plant actions which will enable us now
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  to realize what Edward Teller tried to deal with while he was still alive,
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  the danger of rocks from the area of Jupiter down into so forth.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  Well, that's right. When they saw Shoemaker-Levy crash into one of the gas giants
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  and they did calculations, they know now that every few thousand years we get hit by big rocks,
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  every hundred or a thousand or so we get hit by these big mega rocks,
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  every million or so ones that kill most life on the planet.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  And it just shows that the... why does the current ruling elite...
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  because we've had corrupt elites before, but they wanted to build things,
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  they wanted to advance things, they wanted to...
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  I mean, even old colonialism, depending on the variant, did some good.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  Overall it was bad, but now I see things like the new Obama 2012 film
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  with Dinesh D'Souza coming out and he's there saying,
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  Obama is a anti-colonialist, that's why he wants to destroy the West,
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  but really he's one of these British monarchy monopoly globalists
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  that is actually trying to destroy the old hearts of empire.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  They're in a type of Malthusian de-evolution program against the old nation states.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  How do you quantify that?
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  I always quantify that by the British monarchy's quantification.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  Reduce the human population presently estimated in the range of 7 billion persons
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  to 1 billion persons in a short order.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  And that's the British policy. That's the policy of Obama.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  Oh, he hasn't put it in exactly those terms, but that's what it is.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  What has he done? We don't have production of food anymore.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  We are destroying food supplies as they're being produced
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  into chemical fuels.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  So we are actually in a process of a small group of people, really.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  It's not a big crowd. It's a small group of people.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  But our people have been so crushed.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  Most people in the United States are crushed.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  Their existence is being crushed.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  And since the past three generations, or the past three administrations,
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  the rate of destruction of our economy is horrible.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:46.000]  So the real issue is to get back to a real economy,
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  which means we have to get rid of this hyperinflation.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  And that can be done by one law.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  We can get rid of the whole hyperinflation.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  Bring that glass, Tegel.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  Let me ask you this question, because I know you're a historian in this area.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  This is a Venetian black nobility,
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  a malconization form of welfare developed between the city-states
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  in what is Italy today.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  We know that it's exported to England.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  That then becomes the model of empire.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  But get us into the minds of these people.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  Why do they want to not have a space program?
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  Why do they want to make people poor?
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  Why are they so evil?
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  Take the case of the Roman Empire.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  Roman Empire died, and all these empire systems have died.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  They died out of their own self-destruction beforehand.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  Byzantium, the same kind of thing.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  The old Venetian system, again, the same thing.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  The Dark Ages were the old system.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  Then you had a revival of the same kind of system,
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  which came up with the Anglo-Dutch version,
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  which was called the New Venetian Party.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  The New Venetian Party was then established to British monarchy
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  and established it as an empire.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  And so therefore you have a history of this tradition,
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  of this kind of system, of what we call the oligarchal system,
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  comes up where a few people are tried by various means
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  to control the planet, or large parts of it,
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  and do a general destructive thing.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  The problem has been that despite our constitution,
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  and despite our intention,
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  and the intention of some other countries to this effect,
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  we have not been able to secure an actual system of government
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  which conforms to what our intention was in creating the United States.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  Even the United States was unable, during much of its history,
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  to avoid being crushed and gobbled up by oligarchal influences.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  And that's the same thing now.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:46.000]  You have a very small minority of the influential part of the populations
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  of various nations who are now raising hell
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  against literally against human species.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  And this old thing is there,
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  and we have somehow lost the guts to get rid of it.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  Because what you see with the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States,
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  and you see with similar institutions in Europe,
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  and in other parts of the world,
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  that we do have the implicit ability to mobilize the kind of reforms
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  which could be readily applied now
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  to give us a system of global nation states,
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  which would be, they might not all agree with each other,
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  but we have a way of living together as nation states.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  Briefly, before we go to calls, sir,
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  can we get your take on the current state of the economy,
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  and what's happening in Europe, and where you see all of that going?
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  We're on the verge of an actual disintegration of the world economy,
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  a chain reaction kind of breakdown.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  If this policy continues, if Obama were to continue as president,
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  I can assure you that you would not have civilization on this planet.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  So the Republicans aren't doing anything good,
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  but Obama is something with his foreign influences,
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  which is the greatest threat to the existence of the United States
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  and other nations that I know of on this planet today.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  What did you make of his statement telling entrepreneurs
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  and scientists and inventors that you didn't build that?
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  I mean, that was a calculated statement.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  What is the point of a statement like that?
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  Well, the man lies.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  There's no truth in him.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  He's a pathological case.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  As a matter of fact, as I've described him,
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  if you look back in history,
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  he's a guy somebody picked up as a reasonable,
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  wise guy, dirty trick, as an echo of the neo-embranero.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  And if you read the history, the detailed history of the embranero,
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  if you look at the mentality of this president,
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  you find that two things concur.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  They coincide.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  But somebody, and some people,
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  got the bright idea of taking this character,
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  and by means which I wouldn't call exactly legal,
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  got him picked as a president and stuck him in office,
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  and you see what he's done since being in office.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  He's done everything indirectly as imitations.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  In some degree, Adolf Hitler in the sense of similar kinds of things were done,
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  and were done by the neo-embranero
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  and a few other creeps in between there.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  Well, yeah, trying to shut down most of our coal power plants,
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  trying to pass carbon taxes,
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  trying to in free speech arresting journalists
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  who talk to whistleblowers,
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  charging whistleblowers with the Espionage Act.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  I had Chris Hedges, the renowned Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist on,
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  who's very respected, quote, liberal,
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  and he said, he said, Obama is much worse than Bush.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  And we can say, well, Bush, Obama are puppets.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  But whatever oligarchy team is behind him
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000]  is our raving lunatics,
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:58.000]  because there is a madness of power.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  I mean, we tend to look at elites and say,
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  they know what they're doing, there's a method of the madness.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  But you talk about Nero or Caligula, those are good examples.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  I mean, it really is, they're so disconnected.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000]  It's like what's coming out at the Justice Department,
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000]  and these women are resigning now, so that Lynn's credence
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  and a lot of other suits are getting filed.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.000]  The bizarre sexual escapades,
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000]  the dressed up in dominatrix outfits,
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  calling men into their offices,
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  doing things on air I can't even mention,
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000]  this is a group of lunatics.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000]  That's fair term.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  So what do you expect them to do to try to hold onto power?
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  Because you're right, big Democrats like Hillary aren't going,
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.000]  Rahm Emanuel, you know, left early from the convention this week.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.000]  You know, even, was it Newsweek or was it Time came out
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  and said hit the road, Obama?
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000]  I mean, it does look like a lot of the power structure
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  is moving away from Obama.
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.000]  Why is that?
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000]  Well, essentially they know that,
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  but the part of it is the way the control works.
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000]  The control works through a few very powerful,
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  also financially powerful people in various parts of the world
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  who are able to lure other people
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  into going along with this kind of stuff.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  You see, many people, for example,
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  we don't have any industries left in the United States today.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  They were taken away, taken away in the past dozen years,
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  especially.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  So people feel powerless.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000]  Many people are going to die of starvation, actually,
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  in the United States.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000]  And for other reasons,
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  the situation of our people is hopeless,
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  and yet it's very difficult to mobilize the people
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  to defend themselves.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.000]  Well, yeah, we've got 47 million people, roughly,
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  on food stamps.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  You've got just all these other economic numbers
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  that show we're really in a depression for four years.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000]  You've got crime exploding,
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  but the mainstream media tries to put a cover on it
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.000]  and say, oh, we left the recession four years ago.
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  It's almost a Marie Antoinette let them eat cake
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  while the Obama administration does everything it can
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  with economics 101 to hurt poor people
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  while posing as their savior.
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:16.000]  Imagine if we didn't have the people on the welfare cards,
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000]  the digital food stamp cards,
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  having 47 million people on the street at soup lines,
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  what that would look like every day.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  Well, the problem is that our government has failed us.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  Our political parties have failed us.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  The political parties go along to get along.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  That's their slogan, and they've been a charge for that
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  for a long time.
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  This slogan of the Senate, the slogan of the Congress,
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  go along to get along.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  And the rule that generally rules our congressional system,
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  our representative system,
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  is that piece of corruption called go along to get along,
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  which is the motto of the Congress.
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.000]  And as long as we allow the Congress to go along,
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  to go along to get along,
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:05.000]  and thus refusing to challenge their colleagues in the Congress
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  to cut this crap out,
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  then we get this kind of government.
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  I know what's happening historically,
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000]  and I want your brief take on this,
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000]  and we're going to go to Col. Sir.
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:18.000]  So many times you mentioned Nero and others.
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000]  When they have all this power,
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.000]  the people in control at the very top
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  start almost flirting with disaster,
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.000]  almost tempting it in their indolence,
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  in their spoiled rottenness.
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  It's like a moth to flame, and they play with destruction.
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  They flirt with it, and then bring it.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  That's the case of history.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  You take what we know of human history.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  We know that this kind of phenomenon
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  is the source of all corruptions.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  It's something which becomes
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  a kind of a mass movement of self-corruption.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  And those things have happened.
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  Whole nations and even empires have disintegrated
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  under that kind of corruption.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  We have not yet succeeded,
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  except in a few exceptional terms,
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  especially in trying to do that
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  with the North American development of our system.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  But even our system then became corrupted in the same way.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  Look, when Time Magazine writer Joel Stein
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  makes fun of aborted babies,
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  and I've covered it before you got on,
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  and says we should have a beauty pageant of dead babies,
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  and this is Time Magazine.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  It's reached a level of just insane Romans
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  running around doing the types of things
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  that Nero did at parties.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  And it just shows that these are lunatics.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  Let's go to phone calls.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  Joe in South Carolina, you're on the air with Lyndon LaRouche.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  Go ahead.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  Yes, thank you very much.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  Mr. LaRouche, 2.1,
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  you talk about trying to mobilize the people
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  to fix things here, get rid of people like Obama.
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  When we have something like the GOP
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  that clearly doesn't want to fix the problem,
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  obviously, because if they really wanted to get rid of Obama,
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  they'd put someone like Ron Paul or the like of that
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  as the candidate because you pull all the Republicans,
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  you pull a lot of independents,
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  you pull a lot of other people that support that kind of character,
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  someone like Obama start fixing the problem.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  So we don't even have a political party
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  that, A, has the clout, and then, B,
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  the second point is that our electoral system
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  is rigged to a certain extent.
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  I mean, our...
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  There needs to be a question here
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  because we don't have a lot of time.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  The bottom line is he's saying
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  the power structure itself
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  is beginning to ignore the corrupt elements at the top,
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  and that's the real revolution
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  is the velvet restoration of intellectually
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  not complying, not going along,
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  and speaking out against the system.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  I mean, is that what you're getting at, Lyndon?
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000]  Well, no, specifically what happens is
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  when many people start to suffer
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  and there's not enough to go along,
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  then some people decide that,
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  well, somebody have to survive,
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  and we have to survive.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  Unfortunately, other people will have to go.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  And when that policy comes in
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  and that practice comes in,
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  that's what you've got right now.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  You've got that attitude
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  within many parts of the public.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  You've got people in desperate conditions
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  and nothing is being done.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  And the president who's doing this to them,
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  the worst president we had in our history,
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  this president, is actually the engineer
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  who's being given the support
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  to carry out just exactly those policies.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  Amazing.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  All right, we're gonna come back.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  Talk to Brad Listing on XM-166.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  Talk to Scott Joseph Anthony
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  with quick questions, folks.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  Four-lingel Rouge,
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  kind of a speech about how
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  we're in trouble, the political system's corrupt.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  We've been talking about that for 40 minutes.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  45 minutes.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  I mean, we know that.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  I'm not saying the caller's a bad caller.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  It's just that, yes,
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  exactly, we have an insane ruling elite.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  My name is Frank Bates,
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  and I've got some urgent news for you.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000]  Did you know that a solar storm in 1989
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  caused an enormous blackout in Quebec?
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  Here's the really bad news.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  Experts are predicting that solar storms
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000]  will get really severe over the next year,
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  and our electric grid is extremely vulnerable.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  In fact, the Wall Street Journal reported
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  that we could soon face blackouts
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  lasting weeks or months,
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  leaving major parts of the USA temporarily uninhabitable.
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.000]  Are you prepared for this coming crisis?

[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  And ProEM1, daily probiotic cleanse,
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  is the key to digestive health.

[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  aids in controlling yeast infections,
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  is never freeze dried,
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  and uses three groups of live, viable beneficial microbes
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000]  to cleanse and remove toxins.

[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  Coming up, new TSA documents are out.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  Checkpoints on the highways with body scanners.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  Get ready.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  That just broke at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  Lenin LaRouche is our guest here.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  Let's go to Brad in Virginia, listening on XM Channel 166.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  Welcome, sir, you're on the air.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  Thank you, sir. Love your show.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  First time caller.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  Mr. LaRouche, you're a great patriot.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  Thank you for all that you're doing to bring these,
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  this evil to the public attention.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  I want to first state that it seems like a lot of effort
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  can be wasted trying to identify the source of the evil
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  when we all know that the source of the evil is unseen.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  My question to you is, given the fact,
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  how do we, based upon your wisdom,
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  organize on the local level to be effective
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  and maintain effectiveness without trying to steer it
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  to a dem-Republican-type standoff?
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000]  The point is, don't worry about it.
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  What we have to do is you always start with a small force
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  to organize something.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  And if you can't do it, you can't do it.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  And then the world goes into a bad condition as a result.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  But the point is, what I find out,
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  that I concentrate only on things that I think are worth defending,
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  or more than worth defending, are urgent to be defended.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  And that's the only way, you know, and to do that,
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  you've got to get some knowledge.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  You've got to know what you're talking about.
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  You've got to know what you're talking about,
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  not only in terms of analysis.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  You've got to know what you're talking about
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  in terms of what will work.
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  I have been somebody who says,
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  oh, unless there are two evils, I'm not going to vote for anybody.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000]  But the fact that, you know,
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  that even people like Lyndon LaRuse are saying,
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  you know, don't vote for Obama when he's nonpartisan,
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  shows you that that group is so criminal and so insane,
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  they've got to go.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  And we're not saying Romney's good either.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  But at least something new in will give people a breather.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  I mean, is that what you're getting at, Lyndon, or am I wrong?
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  In that direction, if we're fighting for the right thing
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  and stick to it and don't try to be opportunistic,
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  but because people have seen so many lies
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  and the lies to which they've been subjected by people
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  who they thought represented them
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  have made them very angry.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  So what are you doing in the election then?
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  I mean, just kind of stand.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  I don't believe that party systems are that important.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  You know, if George Washington didn't want a party system,
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  but some other people in the United States
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  decided they wanted parties.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  No, I agree with you. I don't like the party system.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  It turns into gangs.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  So what are you saying?
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  We can just take over a party,
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  create a new party, get rid of the parties?
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  What do you do?
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  No, the problem is this.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  When people get so partisan that they think they're playing
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  a football or a baseball game
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  and don't think about the effect for the nation,
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  they decide they're going to have a party and they're going to win.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  I think that's nonsense.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  I think the question is just try to educate people
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  and bring them to an understanding
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  of what the real problems are.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  No, I agree.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  We'll never fix the party system.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  If people don't understand,
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  we're run by foreign banking oligarchs.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  Mr. LaRose, have you noticed suddenly
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  in financial publications in CNBC
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  they're bragging that we've been conquered
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  by a banking oligarchy,
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  but saying the banker's no best?
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  What is this flaunting in our face?
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  Well, they're actually whistling dixie, so to speak,
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  because they don't have anywhere.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  Look at the whole situation in Europe.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  Look at the situation in the United States.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  Look at all these institutions
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  that claim to manage international finance.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000]  They're not controlling anything.
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  Any day now, any moment,
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.000]  the entire Western, the Central European system
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000]  can disintegrate.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:03.000]  Now, our people in Europe and I together
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  don't want this integration of Europe.
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  But there are people who say,
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:12.000]  we're going to force you to do as we want,
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  or we're going to destroy you.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  And people are sometimes intimidated
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  and fall prey to this sort of thing.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000]  But the only thing you can do,
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000]  you've got to fight for the truth.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  If you can't fight for the truth,
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000]  you're going to lose anyway.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  So I think the point is being independent.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.000]  But also, I think the mistake is
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000]  any kind of partisanship,
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  like a football game where people...
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000]  Tell you what, do five more minutes with us.
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  Finish up on that and take a few calls if you can.
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000]  So our friends at Solutions From Science
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.000]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.000]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000]  And it can produce an endless supply
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000]  of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  And here's the best part.
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:25.000]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000]  And you actually get enough seeds
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:32.000]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:38.000]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:42.000]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.000]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:59:47.000 --> 02:00:05.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000]  We've got five more minutes with Lyndon LaRouche.
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000]  We'll turn 90 tomorrow.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000]  Your host will be just joined us.
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000]  Got a bunch of breaking news coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  And then the makers of a new film that's being developed,
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  very impressive what I've seen so far.
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:39.000]  Grace State are going to be joining us.
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:42.000]  So that is coming up as well.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  But we are talking right now to Lyndon LaRouche.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000]  Lyndon, you were getting into the collapse of Europe.
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  I mean, this is a design collapse.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  And they're saying now they're going to use the nations in debt
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:55.000]  to shine them fully over to private banks
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:58.000]  that will now run the EU itself.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.000]  And you're right.
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  They say they're in control.
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  They're in control of the arson they've engaged in.
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.000]  But now it's out of control.
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000]  And it really just does seem like a disconnect.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  I mean, take John Corzine and others that are making 40-to-1 bets with people's money.
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  There is an insanity to these people.
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  They were bold enough to get into power because they are crazy
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000]  and arrogant and daring.
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  We good people need to just dare back.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  I mean, I think that's really it,
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  is that we can't let their intimidation get to us.
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  I mean, is that the essence of what you're saying?
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:35.000]  I would say I would look at it the other way from the positive side.
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:38.000]  What has to be done to cure the problem?
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  We know what the problem is.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  And just talking about the problem is not going to cure it.
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.000]  But you need only clarity about what the nature of the problem is.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.000]  But like the European system, if Europe does not,
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  Europe could do one thing.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  Glass-Steagall is now becoming very popular in Europe.
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  Sometimes even more popular in the United States.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:02.000]  But Glass-Steagall is the only thing that will save either Europe or the United States right now.
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  Without Glass-Steagall, the US economy, the European economy, worse are dead.
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:11.000]  So it's time for Glass-Steagall, and that won't be enough.
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  But there are other measures which can, a couple of other measures which would work.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:18.000]  We can revive this economy if we want to.
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:22.000]  Europe could also, with cooperation with the United States in this kind of approach,
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000]  could also make it.
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000]  China could make it.
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  Russia could make it.
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.000]  Other nations could make it.
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  We can make it if we have the will and judgment to do what should be done.
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  When they're trying to play games, either my game or else, or nothing,
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.000]  that kind of thing is what's going to kill us.
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  And they want an economy where they implode things because they can organize
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  the controlled collapse and consolidate it.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.000]  This is a neo-feudalistic, piratical, wrecker system,
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:59.000]  and we have to recognize that and remove the people that are engineering society in this direction.
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:04.000]  Well, when people depend upon money per se as their idea of economy,
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  they're going to do this.
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  This economy of the United States has originally created, got into this money business,
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:17.000]  but the foundation of our Constitution was not a money system.
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  It was the creation of federal credit used as a monetary form of credit
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:30.000]  in order to give credit for financing that was people who had useful ideas
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:34.000]  would get credit for developing those ideas.
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  The object was not to get money for money's sake.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  The object was to use and create a system of credit which was monetized
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  in order to provide the funds needed to create the employment
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  which would be productive for the nation.
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.000]  Sure, they were giving 0% credit to the productive small businesses
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  and not turning off our power plants and not doing everything they can to shut us down.
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.000]  We'd be booming.
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  That's what the Federal Reserve says, oh, we're overheating.
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  We're going to do this and that.
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  They don't want us being wealthy.
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:11.000]  That's what feudalism is, is making us poor, controlling us through economic degradation.
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  I could tell you one thing on this is probably relevant for this purpose.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  I could solve this problem.
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000]  I know all the solutions.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  I'm an economist.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  I've been the best economist as a forecaster in the United States history in recent years.
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000]  I know how to do these things.
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  They can be done.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  The other people beside me know how they can be done.
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  All we have to do is decide we're going to do it.
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  We can get this country back and we can build other countries too.
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  Wow, we'll have to have you back very soon.
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  Have a great birthday tomorrow.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  Lyndon LaRouche, thank you for being gracious with your time.
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  Thank you.
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000]  And folks, you'll see the new film you guys have.
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  It's right there behind you, Unsurvivable.
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.000]  They're at your website.
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  You'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this quick break.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:23.000]  I'm Alex Jones with prisonplanet.tv.
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:31.000]  You can have the peace of mind knowing that you can create endless supply of silver anytime, anywhere for any application.
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:38.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:43.000]  This product was designed to be an invaluable part of your vital preparations.
[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:50.000]  For a detailed report on the differences between ionic silver, colloidal silver and what most silver solution manufacturers are producing,
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:06:00.000]  please visit our website at www.silverlungs.com for more information on why you should be producing your own silver solutions right from your home forever.
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:28.000]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.000]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:44.000]  The fact is you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:48.000]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:54.000]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:59.000]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:22.000]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:35.000]  Doesn't require electricity. Purify water from lake streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:38.000]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:42.000]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:45.000]  Propure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000]  It's what my family uses.
[02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:50.000]  infowars.com already has the lowest price on propure.
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:56.000]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at infowars.com.
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  Also call to order 888-253-3139.
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:08.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:28.000]  Okay, for the next 40 minutes or so, we've got some amazing filmmakers on with us,
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:34.000]  because I've seen the trailer for the film they're making called Gray State.
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:35.000]  Very impressive.
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:40.000]  They also interviewed me at Bilderberg for separate documentaries that they're producing.
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:43.000]  And just first-rate work from what I've seen.
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:48.000]  Very exciting because a film like this, properly developed and deployed,
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:51.000]  is the type of thing that could really wake up a nation.
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  That's happened with books and films before.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:57.000]  You never know which film, which book is going to do it,
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:03.000]  or if it's a consortium of books and films together that causes the tipping point.
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  And we're almost there.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.000]  It's going to be talking to those gentlemen here in just a moment.
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:13.000]  Then after they leave us, we'll have about 15 minutes of other very, very important breaking news here.
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:20.000]  More new documents show that TSA intends to deploy body scanners at rail, bus, and ferry terminals.
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  We all knew that was coming.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:27.000]  And more four-year documents have come out now.
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  The abuse, the basically rape that's going on with objects,
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  their hands they're using on people, and how they say it will be everywhere.
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  Highway checkpoints, rail, bus, ferry terminals, everywhere.
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  The accursed federal non-police.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:49.000]  We'd better have police doing it, just very, very frightening.
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  It says millimeter wave, microwave technology, and that they'd be rolling it out.
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  So that's been the plan since 2008.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:04.000]  A very important report by Steve Watson at infowars.com.
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:07.000]  This has been the plan for a very long time.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  An update, Canada not only has closed its embassy in Iran today,
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  they've now expelled Iranian diplomats.
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000]  And other countries are doing that.
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  This is the closest we've ever gotten to this war kickoff.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  They've sent fleets off to menace the Chinese.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  People are like, what, you saying the Commies are good?
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  No, but we got globalist bankers running us that are trying to start wars, folks.
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:30.000]  You don't want a war with the Communist Chinese or the Russians.
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  Meanwhile, the globalists are playing both sides, handing over our infrastructure,
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:39.000]  handing over our jobs, tax incentives to ship our jobs to China, to ship General Motors.
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  I mean, it's a multi-faceted attack program.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.000]  And it's insane, is what it is.
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  The people running our planet are out of control and do not have our best interest.
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000]  At heart, there is no doubt of that.
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:59.000]  Other TSA news here. TSA kicks woman off flight for bad attitude.
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:00.000]  She got it on video.
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  They come up to her after she's gone through the stupid slave training,
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  Fallujah training checkpoint, prisoner training checkpoint.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.000]  She buys a bottle of water inside of the shop.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  They walk over.
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  They say, we want that.
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000]  And she went ahead and just drank it in front of them.
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  Because in the old days, they drank that show.
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  It's not a weapon.
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  And again, it's about you're guilty.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000]  You're going to do what I say.
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  It's nothing, but I'm going to peck at you till you do what I want.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  Amazing video up at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000]  And Watson's article is a great headline.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000]  TSA kicks woman off flight for bad attitude.
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  But it's really not that.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  TSA kicks woman out of airport for drinking water.
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  And the TSA minion, another not an agent, another not an officer, says,
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:53.000]  No, I did it because we're going to punish you for not letting us stick a tester in your bottle water.
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  And of course, when our story went viral this week,
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:04.000]  they had a what the Dallas morning news called a hoax that there was a liquid bomb on a flight from Philadelphia to Dallas.
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:10.000]  I mean, this is just absolutely criminal organization because this is the big power grab.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000]  They don't care 40 billion years lost in terrorism.
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  They don't care if it turns everybody against the government because they're going ahead with it.
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  They're going to be everywhere, including your house.
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:19.000]  They're not stopping.
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:23.000]  And now police, federal judges are ruling, can stick their hands down.
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:26.000]  Your pants without warrants are probable cause or do whatever they want.
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  If they're trained by the TSA, you heard me right.
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:30.000]  You take some goon.
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  That's how tyrants work.
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:36.000]  They create a goon force, a brown shirt force, and then say to the German military and police,
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  see, you won't do this, but our gangs will.
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:44.000]  Then finally they go, you know what military, you will do what they've done.
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  And once the military and police start doing it, they go, now you get to kill them.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000]  Go ahead and kill them now.
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000]  You never like these, these goons.
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  You can kill them now or you can arrest them now.
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000]  And that's what Stalin did.
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:58.000]  Lenin did it.
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:59.000]  Mao did it.
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:00.000]  Hitler did it.
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  There's an exact playbook that's run.
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.000]  Okay.
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:06.000]  And we're watching it all be played out here.
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  The difference is our four bearers were put, put, put, put time bombs in against tyranny.
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:18.000]  The second amendment, free speech, all these things, time bombs.
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  And so it isn't going to go the way it went in other countries here.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  It's already not going that way.
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  They're way behind.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  So that's some of the news.
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  The cybersecurity legislation, he wants executive order now that he can't get draconian censorship.
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  I mean, this is big, folks, ruled by executive decree.
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  That's just some of the news and information we have now.
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  Going to our guest here joining us via video Skype if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv.
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  David Crowley and Danny August Mason.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  And the website is greatstatemovie.com.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:14:01.000]  And I was at Bilderberg, you know, protesting eight, nine, 10 hours a day, bullhorning, shaking hands and then going back into radio and TV until the wee hours in the morning.
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000]  So I was pretty exhausted the last day before I left.
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000]  I wanted an interview.
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000]  I didn't know it was for a great state documentary.
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  Okay, sure.
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000]  They asked some good questions and I kind of scumbled off.
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  And then I saw the trailer a few weeks, a month ago or so.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  And I've been meaning to get them on ever since.
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:20.000]  And we'll be playing some of the trailer without audio because it doesn't translate well on radio.
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:25.000]  But for people watching on the Internet, we'll be playing some of the video in the background while they speak.
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:33.000]  But I mean, it looks like a trailer that would be produced by HBO or something.
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:39.000]  In fact, it looks like a trailer that would be produced for a $20 million budget movie.
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:44.000]  Wouldn't say B, but wouldn't say Jerry Bruckheimer.
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000]  But it looks like HBO quality.
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:49.000]  I mean, it's right up there and imagine what they could do with funding.
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000]  And I'm not associated with the movie.
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000]  I'm not, you know, I don't have stock in it or anything.
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000]  I just like to see things produced and made.
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:59.000]  I helped, you know, start Luke Radowski off and we are changing so many other groups.
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  That's how you defeat people is by creating all these other organizations.
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000]  That's how you defeat the globalists.
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:13.000]  That's how you defeat tyrants is creating so many movements and groups are helping get them rolling to where you can't be stopped.
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000]  You reach critical mass.
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  And I mean, I really hope these guys get this film made briefly.
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:23.000]  People want to know about you individually from greatstatemovie.com.
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  So in a minute each David Crowley first and Danny Mason, tell us about yourselves and the impressive film you're working on.
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  And you're also trying to crowdsource fun now.
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:38.000]  Charlie Manson's records are finally going to get produced with hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  Thanks to crowdsourcing.
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  So if that scumbag can get his stuff produced off the crowdsourcing, I hope you can.
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:50.000]  So let's let's give it a shot here today. Tell us about yourselves and then about the film.
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  Hey, it looks good to talk to you again.
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:53.000]  I'm David Crowley.
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:56.000]  I'm the writer and director of great state and I'm a veteran.
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.000]  I'm a husband.
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:58.000]  I'm a father.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  And the interesting thing about this material once you delve into it is that everyone has to act within their own capacity to express this information.
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:12.000]  So great state has been my effort to kind of draw the human narrative out of all this terrifying information that we see all around us.
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:18.000]  And I think that's been my responsibility as a filmmaker to kind of craft a human story out of this.
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  And I think what I want to definitely tell your listeners is that every time you look at some of these things happening, like, why isn't anyone showing this in a film?
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000]  I mean, that is what I'm doing.
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:28.000]  That is what great state is.
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:32.000]  Great state is the Alex Jones film, essentially.
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:41.000]  But as my role as a soldier having to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan, I definitely can see the consequences of these kind of trends playing out and not being corrected.
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:45.000]  So great state definitely shows that.
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:46.000]  Well said.
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:47.000]  Yeah, my name is Danny Alex.
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:50.000]  First off, thanks for having us on the show.
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:56.000]  I'm an actor, co creator and help consult the story for great state.
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:09.000]  I've actually been lecturing on the topic about dealing with FEMA also Federal Reserve United Nations for about five years now across the country and
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:19.000]  I guess collaborated with David back in 2010 about the information on it and we both were on the same page about it and it just kind of spawned from there.
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:22.000]  And ever since then, it's just been a hell of a ride.
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:30.000]  So it's definitely instead of just being just an action film, it's definitely more of a narrative film character driven piece.
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000]  And that's what we're sticking to our guns with on it.
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:40.000]  I think that's an important distinction to make is that it's not a documentary where a documentary will pander pander to a certain crowd already subscribed to those beliefs.
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:41.000]  This is a narrative film.
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:42.000]  It's a literal movie.
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  You're going to go to theater and see.
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:46.000]  So just imagine the possibilities there.
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:55.000]  I mean, mainstream media in in in effect has usurped our traditional heritage of storytelling as a means of passing on our culture as an anti-culture.
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000]  All we have are movies.
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:04.000]  So the mainstream media in that usurpation of that, they've been able to dominate what we see in here and what we pass on to our children.
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:13.000]  So imagine if we get a film like Gray State showing in a 1984 sort of format certain consequences of a failure to embrace liberty.
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:23.000]  Yeah, I tried to get Rick Linklater to make a 1984 but but future dystopic and and he did make scanner darkly, which is excellent.
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  But but but I want to one that was contemporary to a military takeover.
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000]  I mean, I just told him about it and talked about it.
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:34.000]  But this looks about like the quality of something, you know, that, you know, that he would put out.
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000]  I mean, it looks really, really good.
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:41.000]  How does you guys have how much money to just just this this trailer cost?
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  Because I mean, I mean, I can see it with the crowds, the actors, they're all doing a really good job.
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  I mean, this looks like HBO quality here.
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000]  How did you get this done?
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:53.000]  Well, when Danny came to came to us and he's like, hey, guys, check out FEMA camps, check out these things.
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:56.000]  We're like, OK, and then it's like, oh, wow, wow, this is important.
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:59.000]  And we should probably pay attention.
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:02.000]  So of course, we go about making a film because that's what we do.
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:09.000]  But my partner Mitch and I run a production company called Hothead Productions and we do photography, videography and filmmaking, of course.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:18.000]  And so basically Gray State, while you say it looks good, that is essentially cheated just be just out of pocket from Mitch and I's production company.
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:22.000]  And it's doing what we do best, making films in an independent fashion.
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:27.000]  So we went through the entire production process for every scene for a trailer.
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  I mean, we had to do location permits and casting and arranging all these resources.
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:35.000]  But yeah, it was funded basically on a budget.
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:42.000]  I would like to help you guys, you know, get this done, but also because I've actually been around Hollywood and what goes on there.
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:48.000]  You've got to be careful because nine percent of the time some big fish will come along claiming they're going to help you.
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:52.000]  And all they'll do is pay you a little money, take control of it and then never produce it.
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:56.000]  So if I was you, you're going the right way crowdsourcing.
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:22.000]  I would not take any big money or big investors. They will kill your film.
[02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:28.000]  The reason I'm doing this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods direct now.
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:32.000]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:38.000]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods direct because we've all known this was coming.
[02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:41.000]  You know about their delicious long term storable foods.
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:44.000]  The fact is you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:48.000]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:54.000]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.

[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:05.000]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:08.000]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:17.000]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president could obtain this world class healer.
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:23.000]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:35.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:41.000]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:49.000]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:59.000]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns. Call 800-686-2237. Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:09.000]  My name is Angie and ever since my daughter had alternating diarrhea and constipation, she suffered from hair loss, listlessness and was stunted in her growth.
[02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:22.000]  After getting her onto two supplements suggested by Neutropath Steven Hewer, she has improved dramatically. Her stools had normalized, her hair and her body are growing again, and she is beaming.
[02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:25.000]  I credit the majority of her improvement to one-world-way.
[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:30.000]  Children love the taste of one-world-way and their growing bodies are getting nature's best source of protein.
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:37.000]  Evidence shows that non-denatured whey protein powder is a better source of protein than meat, milk or eggs.
[02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:45.000]  If you have finicky children and you want a protein that will support their growth, energy and healthy brain function, one-world-way is a must for you to try.
[02:23:45.000 --> 02:24:08.000]  Kids prefer it over junk food. Call 888-988-3325 or visit 1worldway.com.
[02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:24.000]  If you want to get more into the plot of the film and how much funding you need to get it done properly to then put it in theaters, you've seen what Obama 2016 has done.
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:38.000]  It's reached tens of millions of people and it's made, I don't know, $20 million, whatever it is now. And the cinematography is great and everything, but the budget of that looks like maybe a million bucks.
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:44.000]  A fictional account of near future paralleling reality, I think, is a great way to go.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:51.000]  But tell people where they can go to learn more about it and where they can go to crowdsource it. Explain how you're trying to fund this.
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:59.000]  All right. All details about the film are available at greystatemovie.com, but our crowdfunding is at indiegogo.com slash greystatemovie.
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.000]  And you've got links at greystatemovie.com to that.
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  Yep.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:08.000]  And you've raised $13,000. You're trying to raise $50,000.
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:23.000]  Well, one important thing that we should say is that $50,000 is simply just to get us off the ground. This movie cannot be made via crowdsourcing. I mean, if we want to do it right, if we want to lend it the scale that it needs, I mean, Mitch and I can cheat it this way.
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:29.000]  And we spent $6,000 on the trailer. You say it looks like a million dollars. If we get a million dollars, it'll look like $6 million and so on.
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:35.000]  But crowdfunding is not how we're going to fund it, but it is how we're going to get it seen by the right people.
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:45.000]  Well, they've had tens of millions raised with crowdfunding. I saw an idea just a few weeks ago to have these little watches, just little cheap watches with, you know, with different faces.
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:53.000]  They wanted to raise a couple hundred thousand. They raised like 12 million and had to cut off the money coming into them. So I wouldn't sell yourself short going on this.
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.000]  Right, Alex.
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:55.000]  Yeah, hopefully.
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:59.000]  That would require a massive grassroots campaign similar to what Ron Paul has done.
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:00.000]  Yeah.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:07.000]  We need to get out there and we've had the campaign going for 30 days and so far we've only gotten 13,000 out of 50,000.
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:19.000]  Well, Ron Paul, when I kept going, if Jesse Benton hadn't started calling his main supporters extremist, as we've seen from Peter Schiff's email telling him not to, you know, and I mean, now those of us that know what's going on, we're the bad guys.
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:26.000]  Ron Paul's still a great guy, but the Republican establishment is literally taking everything over, but I don't want to get off. I don't want to get off into that.
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:32.000]  Break down the plot of the film for people or an overview so they know what we're trying to get out to people.
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:41.000]  Well, an important distinction to make is that the trailer is sort of a Hollywood style trailer showing a lot of action and stuff, and that's not really what the film is about.
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:49.000]  The film takes place in the context of a future societal breakdown, which does parallel reality trends that we see every day.
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:56.000]  The story itself will, of course, follow a character who goes through a character arc and it tells a very human story, exploring human truths.
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:05.000]  That's an important distinction to make. This isn't a snuff film. It's not fear propaganda. It's not fear mongering. It is a human film. So it follows a narrative.
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000]  It's really a love story.
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:13.000]  It can't be described. It's almost a monster movie. It's a love story. It's all of these things. It's very, very layered.
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  It doesn't chronicle the collapse, but it follows characters and the decisions they have to make in the event of a societal, economic collapse, police state, martial law.
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:35.000]  We got a couple tweets out at twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones. Go retweet those folks. Systematic takeover, Liberty bringing the New World Order,
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:43.000]  Gray State movie director and lead actor live now. So I guess that's the tweet. I was telling them to send out a tweet just pointing out.
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.000]  Go check out the site and help get the film made. I think that's probably what we need to tweet.
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  And we've also got folks tuning in there at the real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:28:01.000]  But obviously it shows economic collapse takeover, people being rounded up. All those real preparations are being made.
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  So regardless, you know, I mean, just the trailer you've made helps give people kind of an image of where this is going to go.
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:14.000]  If we just decide that anything in a uniforms God, well, the corrupt system will take that as a signal to move forward.
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:21.000]  Absolutely. And going into the trailer, we realized we had to be extremely visual stimulating on the images.
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:29.000]  So you see a lot of haunting images of soldiers on the streets, raids into the house, black bagging, a haunting images.
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  And that's only best way we could do it for actually selling the product for the getting the film funded on it.
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  But we are trying to be true to reality itself. So it's not necessarily a polarized debate saying soldiers are bad or soldiers are good.
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:52.000]  We have characters embedded in the film that follow very real decision making problems.
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  I mean, the scenarios include just a National Guard soldier. Am I going to follow my order? And this goes back on like what the conversations we've had with Stuart Rhodes and the oathkeepers.
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:08.000]  Are you going to follow orders and round up people and put the gun to the back of the head of the American people?
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:13.000]  Or are you going to exercise your own moral capabilities and make the right choice?
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:18.000]  The soldiers will go through the soldiers and police in the film go through that realistically.
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:23.000]  It's not a polarized thing where we're going to say police and military are bad.
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:30.000]  And also too, and we show a couple characters in that who are actually civilians or regular people and about their decisions.
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:36.000]  If they're going to go along with the takeover or if they're going to go against it and actually...
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:40.000]  That's actually the scarier part is what the civilians are going to do.
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:43.000]  And by the way, the takeover is ongoing.
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:47.000]  If we resist too much politically, they'll stage terror attacks to launch the hot war against us.
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:50.000]  We'll be right back. We'll talk about the guillotines in the film.
[02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:53.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.000 --> 02:30:18.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000]  We're on the run.
[02:30:53.000 --> 02:31:11.000]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cow Bend Soap Company.
[02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:15.000]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:22.000]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.
[02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:30.000]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:36.000]  Buy the one to two month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:41.000]  Or save big with a one to two year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs.
[02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000]  This is an amazing deal.
[02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:48.000]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:56.000]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:27.000]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now.
[02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:31.000]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, e-foods will have to raise prices too.
[02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:37.000]  I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we've all known this was coming.
[02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:40.000]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:47.000]  The fact is you can eat it anytime to save money today and because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:53.000]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to e-foodsdirect.com forward slash alex.
[02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:58.000]  Call 800-409-5633 or e-foodsdirect.com forward slash alex.
[02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:18.000]  You can bet your life on e-foods direct.
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:53.000]  David Crowley, writer, producer, editor, BFX artist, composer, very talented folks, and Danny Mason, who is an actor and director, you name it, in theater and film, University of Kansas, won't go over their whole bio.
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:34:10.000]  But greatstatemovie.com. And I like to have people on like this sometime who have a passion and a dream because in just the process of trying to make their film, they're putting out many documentaries, they're putting out trailers, they're already reaching hundreds of thousands and then hopefully millions of people.
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:14.000]  And we need to help people who are trying to get the word out.
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:35.000]  We need to help folks that are trying to fight tyranny because so many people, they either want some big, giant, elaborate master plan that it's going to perfectly, in a chain reaction, like one of those toys where you put the marbling one in and it goes through all the different ladders and loops and elevators then comes out perfectly, or they don't want to do it.
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:43.000]  And so much of it is just saying, I'm standing up for the truth. We know what classical tyranny and oppression is. It's happening here.
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:49.000]  And the people that have hijacked our country, they're admitting that. I mean, they're admitting that we're an occupied nation by foreign banks.
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:55.000]  They're admitting they're getting rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution. They're putting RFID and satellite trackers on children nationwide.
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:35:03.000]  They know fluoride gives you brain cancer and bone cancer and dumbs you down. I mean, Harvard admits it. These are really evil people.
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:10.000]  And they don't move against us all because they don't really have the power. They have to convince us to go along with them.
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:17.000]  So greatstatemovie.com and we are going to tweet out right now. It's going up at infowars.com, the trailer itself.
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:24.000]  And we will tweet that out to you. You're following us at Real Alex Jones. Aaron Dice is coming in with some breaking news after our guests leave us.
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:30.000]  And I've got some other breaking news. We've got about six, seven minutes left with them and I want to get them back on in the near future.
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:34.000]  Maybe, you know, premiere some of their many documentaries on the nightly news to break down what they're doing.
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  But gentlemen, I mean, give us a sneak peek of kind of the script. You're asking for funding and support here.
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:49.000]  People are going to want to know. We get the general idea, but you say not a horror movie. Well, tyranny is horror.
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:54.000]  So I get it's a love story. You know, you love your wife. You love your family. So you better be ready to fight the evil.
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:36:03.000]  But I mean, you got people in white hoods with guillotines as kind of Illuminati executioners and lighting people up and shooting them.
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:12.000]  That's actually the plan in the reeducation centers. The army admits now they do have reeducation camps since we talked in at Bilderberg.
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:22.000]  That's now been confirmed that they have the reeducation camps. So just chilling things happening here. Tell us a little bit about the plot and the man at the guillotine.
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:27.000]  Well, that's that scene does not necessarily happen in the actual feature film.
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:33.000]  What will happen in the film is the reason we call it gray state or one of the reasons is that it's a division of reality.
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:38.000]  So we have people who are living in the Alex Jones world who know what's going on and the people who simply don't.
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:43.000]  And the description being that it's requiring more and more work to support that illusion.
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:51.000]  And what will happen when it's finally contested? It's no longer just a luxury to believe in that false world where you just go to your job and everything.
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:58.000]  So it's almost like the matrix people are so propagandized. They don't know that the other side of town they got guillotine shot in people's heads off.
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:04.000]  And they will believe it. We know that they will not believe it. And that's kind of the striated response we've gotten on the trailer.
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:10.000]  It's either a this is awesome and it's almost true or B this is a bad this is not real.
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:17.000]  And that's why I'm not going to watch the film. And what it does is it shows us how close to reality we're actually getting because it's that emotional knee jerk response.
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:21.000]  Well, yeah, people think that if they deny it, it suddenly makes it not real.
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:30.000]  Exactly. Yeah, because their reality is a form of religion for them. And the more you encroach on that, it's more you you question their morals and ethics and even spiritualism.
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:33.000]  And it becomes a very, you know, sensitive ground in the whole time.
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:40.000]  The reason why we put the guillotine in it was more of the symbolism behind it going back to a very dark mean evil time.
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:49.000]  Almost a cultish. So and we know that they're that that's something that they would do because it's symbolic. It's brutal and it's efficient.
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:38:02.000]  And actually something that happens in the actual great state thing is that they're going to start doing and they're going to start sending you something in the mail saying you have to go operate the guillotine when they round up suspected dissenters and put them in line.
[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:19.000]  Well, I was about to stop you guys have done amazing research. Tell us briefly about your awakenings and what brought you to this point because I sent out my reporters two days ago to do man on the street and they were down to Starbucks downtown and their dress nice
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:36.000]  Linda West and and John Bown and others were out there and all of a sudden they're out front of Starbucks and a guy comes out of three piece suit and they say hi sir we'd like to interview you get your take on just the state of things in America your view on things.
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:47.000]  And that's all they said to him and he goes yeah I got somebody for you and he goes in comes up with a camera starts taking photos of them and the police pull up and then just you know you know check them out.
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  But I mean a woman in a business suit now with a info wars dot com microphone saying hi we're getting your take on the state of things and just the state of America.
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:39:08.000]  That guy guaranteed was in regard and they've literally recruited almost everyone in an executive position, even what you'd say is low level dentist doctors or tried to recruit them.
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:17.000]  Almost every doctor my dad knows medical or dental has had a homeland security visit I mean in America and they're like well what do you want me to watch for.
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:25.000]  I want you just to watch for people are saying about the government what they're doing which is found your patients my dad's like no way he thought it was just him it was others I mean this is already there.
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:28.000]  And again this is the government's like well we're doing it for your safety.
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  They're the ones that got the underwear bomber on the plane they're the ones that ran and we're on the walkie they're the ones putting the floor on their water it's like wow they really are.
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:43.000]  Consciously engage in a takeover and they've got all these weird little minders that feel like secret agents.
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:49.000]  Because I've seen their training videos their training manuals I'm sent by people on the inside it's come out about infra guard.
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:58.000]  And they even give the higher level infra guards firearms and tell them they're secretly deputized federally that they'll be given this even came out in mainstream news what.
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:07.000]  The several big articles a few years ago even had the writer on about it where the headline guys if you look it up with something like.
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:16.000]  Infra guard you know being given license to kill and in the documents they got it was in major news like five years ago.
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:25.000]  They were being prepared that during an emergency they would have to kill some of their employees like the FBI may order you to start killing people.
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:39.000]  So and like the average executive is like on a power trip with a pistol in their drawer and an FBI card literally shaking with pleasure in this delusion of television that they're like a secret agent now and it's really cool.
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:49.000]  No they're going to be throwing you against the public when the globalists are involved in a takeover I don't think people understand what you just said is what they're already training them for go ahead.
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:54.000]  So I mean I want you to comment on that briefly but then also tell me your view of that.
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:41:04.000]  Well I think the essence is pretty much what they're doing not go too much in a cell box is prepping society to accept oppression as a form of security.
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:12.000]  And with that and giving up your liberties and rights on it and most importantly is giving up this idea of free will and choice and what you actually do with that choice.
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:24.000]  And for whatever reason if you're American that simply does not apply to you as if we're somehow immune to the rhythms of history and Alex I want to thank you because we owe a lot of this information coming up because of you and your organization.
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:32.000]  A lot of people like to say that well you guys are just Alex Jones acolytes and that makes you bad and that makes me not want to listen to you.
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:36.000]  Well we have nothing to gain from you being right about this Alex.
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000]  If you're right we're not going to make the film.
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:39.000]  Yeah we're screwed.
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:44.000]  Yeah but if you're wrong I mean why if we're wrong we can go on and make films and have us.
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:48.000]  Yeah but listen the cowards always attack those that are telling it like it is.
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:52.000]  I mean it's official they're training the military for gun confiscation.
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:55.000]  It's official that they have the FEMA camps now.
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:58.000]  And you know we get told hey great job you were right.
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:03.000]  Here's the army document reeducation camps when good people in the army leak it the army admits it's real.
[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  No we're even more wrong when we're right.
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:06.000]  You understand that.
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:09.000]  Yeah that's absolutely true and that's been the response on YouTube.
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:14.000]  97% positive 3% you guys are crazy get out the tinfoil hats I'm not going to watch your film.
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:22.000]  But you notice they'll still 3% dominate the comments because they're paid and a lot of those are admitted shock puppets those aren't even people.
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:28.000]  That could very well be true but the scary thing about gray state is that you're going to have those people who speak out but they represent a silent majority.
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:35.000]  The 97% who don't win revolutions those are the scary ones because the second you challenge their entitlements like in a scenario of the gray state.
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:46.000]  Suggest they're going to revolt so if revolutions are won by the 3% they're going to be turned on by the 97% and that is the real gray state.
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:54.000]  The people who are so mind controlled they don't listen to facts on a reasonable basis and they deny whatever you say just because.
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:43:01.000]  And it's crazy because I've been researching this material since even when I was really really young.
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:13.000]  And I think just from that I always have the questions about situations with government and also with foreign affairs and foreign policies at the same time.
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:20.000]  To never accept the truth as it is but always to go on your own in terms of research and where the truth is is going to lie in the individual.
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:28.000]  It's just our jobs as artists and our responsibility to present the truth and whatever that truth is is dependent on the interpretation of the individual.
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  It's something you've seen from art lately like in the 60s what they did is art represented reality and they represented the zeitgeist of that time.
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:36.000]  We haven't seen that.
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:40.000]  It was a fantastic movement and it just got shunned and that's what we're attempting to do.
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000]  You haven't seen that recently at gray state.
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:43.000]  I'm not saying it's unique.
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:48.000]  I'm not saying it's perfect going back to what you said before but it's one exercise in retaking our mainstream.
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000]  Resistance is victory.
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:53.000]  I mean if we just resist, resist it's like a muscle building.
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:56.000]  We're going to get stronger and better as we go.
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000]  So stop waiting.
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000]  I mean that's why I love what you're doing.
[02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:06.000]  You're just going at it and you're also going at something big but have already created amazing thought-provoking information in the process.
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:10.000]  So it is, you know, the old saying of it's not the destination, it's the journey.
[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:23.000]  That's the trip and I hope people right now go to your website and donate to it $5, $10, $20 because if you won't exercise your first amendment today you'll never exercise the second.
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:27.000]  And the first is more powerful if you use it up front than the second.
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:33.000]  It's a cop out to just get a bunch of guns and sit around on them all day and say, I'm going to kill somebody if they come and try to put me in jail.
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:41.000]  Why don't you instead try to wake up the minions of the system before you have to think about the point of, oh my God, they're going to take me to a FEMA camp.
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:46.000]  Okay, it's time to get the guns out because you're not going to let them take you to a reeducation camp.
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:47.000]  And we're getting to that point.
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:53.000]  The second the guns come out, 80% casualties, 80% fatalities.
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:56.000]  We do not want it to come to that point by any means.
[02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000]  By the way, you talked about Iraq.
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:06.000]  I mean, in a moment, just briefly talking about Iraq and Afghanistan where you are, they admit all that's a laboratory for here.
[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:12.000]  I've ever at MIT Magazine saying what we did in Fallujah with the cameras, the trackers, the face scanners, we're going to do that here.
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:15.000]  And now police are on the highway at checkpoints with face scanners.
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:18.000]  I mean, it's here. This is here. Go ahead.
[02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:19.000]  Oh, also, we know that.
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000]  Yeah, with drones and with everything.
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:26.000]  Yeah, they're trying to impose martial law the same model that they do overseas.
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:29.000]  And yeah, we know that, Alex. We know that. What's next? What's next?
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:33.000]  That's why we're making a film to show the people who otherwise would not be recipients of this message.
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:39.000]  I mean, we were just on a brief note. We were shooting this way before any Occupy Wall Street came out.
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:48.000]  Anything from like the NDA ever came out. And when these events are taking place and people started looking at the images and found us all the trailer,
[02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:51.000]  they just started looking at us like, what's next?
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:57.000]  We don't know. We were just thinking ahead of what would be the worst case scenario and like the scarce thing to come across visually.
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:03.000]  So just because we can, we can, we have that luxury as filmmakers to not to show something, but also not have to prove it.
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000]  We can explore these possibilities.
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:09.000]  I mean, here's the deal. The system is openly preparing for war against us.
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:14.000]  And the film is true. Yeah, this is essentially, it could be described as a documentary.
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:19.000]  Now, I interrupted you a moment ago. We're almost out of time. What was the point you were trying to make?
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:24.000]  Oh, I was just going to say that going back to the nature of resistance, resistance is victory.
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.000]  That is a statement that the great state does a very good job of describing.
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:34.000]  Even though you may be killed resisting, the act of resistance on a metaphysical level has value.
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:37.000]  So we can reassign. I mean, it doesn't, it's not about Ron Paul. We know that now.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:41.000]  It's not about retaking the country and, you know, persisting in this paradigm.
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:47.000]  It's about finding out who you are as a person, as a human being and resisting coercion.
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:52.000]  In this realm and also in the other realms to them. And I'll just only hint at that.
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000]  It's a very layered script. It is.
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:47:03.000]  Well, no, the fight is that it's core spiritual and you'd have to be in deep denial and delusion spiritually now to not know
[02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000]  that the shadows are getting long here.
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:12.000]  Gentlemen, amazing. Again, the website, both the websites for people to go find out what's going on.
[02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:19.000]  We're also just posted the full trailer at info wars.com for people to pass around, but give people the websites one more time.
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:25.000]  Great state movie.com and Facebook.com slash great state movie. Indiegogo.com slash great state movie.
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:30.000]  This is a film you're going to want to see because it's everything that Alex says put on screen.
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:34.000]  Yes. It's going to be so brutal because we don't pull any punches.
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:37.000]  This is not our game to look at the lowest common denominator.
[02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:41.000]  We're going to make it as brutal as we possibly can because that is the reality we're facing.
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000]  And it's up to the people to help us out.
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000]  Right. No studio is going to touch this.
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:46.000]  No, not at all.
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:47.000]  We need you to work.
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:48.000]  Well, David.
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:49.000]  Independent and grass root.
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:50.000]  Sure. David Crowley.
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:53.000]  Danny Mason. We'll talk to you both again soon.
[02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:54.000]  Absolutely. Thanks for having us on.
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:55.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:56.000]  Very excited.
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:01.000]  We're going to get each stuff over on their website as well. And we're going to go break and come back because we tried to start this earlier and never got to it.
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:10.000]  And it's a big deal, not just for people that live outside Austin, but it's a big deal for people all over the country because it's the same thing everywhere.
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:16.000]  They are trying to take Barton Springs, but this is an example of compartmentalization.
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:20.000]  I want you to get started here because you wouldn't just double check my research.
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000]  I said, this is what they told me. Go check it out.
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:26.000]  The managers didn't even know this at Barton Springs, the big giant spring fed pool.
[02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:29.000]  Everybody loves here in Austin, one of the best in the country or the world.
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000]  It's world class.
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:32.000]  There they are.
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:35.000]  I'm watching six, seven bureaucrats with charts.
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:38.000]  I go over, they got hard hats on some of them and I go, what are you doing?
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000]  We're going to shut it down October 1st.
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000]  We're going to drain it down to one foot deep.
[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:45.000]  And that's the end of it.
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:48.000]  And it's going to be closed until next summer, probably.
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:52.000]  And I'm sitting there looking at them and I go, okay.
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:56.000]  And then one of them looked at me smart mouth and said, and there's mermaids.
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:00.000]  And these are like, you know, people with shitty badges on and all this stuff.
[02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  I'm like, okay, because I was the only one with dare go up and talk to them.
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000]  I'm like, one of these weirdos that talks to people.
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000]  Okay, I see you all creeping around.
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:08.000]  What are you doing?
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:11.000]  And so, again, there's nothing wrong structurally.
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:16.000]  They even admitted that it said the UT community wants it to look nicer.
[02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:19.000]  They don't want the 20s and 30s and 40s concrete.
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:20.000]  It's awesome.
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:23.000]  And so there's some little rebar they said in one spot.
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:27.000]  So they're going to tear it all out, pretty much drain it and shut it down.
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000]  Well, the reporter says 11 months.
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:32.000]  You actually dug up in the Daily Texan the whole fact here about this,
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:37.000]  but it just shows how I then go up and talk to the managers and they knew nothing about it, Aaron.
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:40.000]  And they said, really, really, because no one's going to put up with that.
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:41.000]  They won't tell us.
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000]  They won't even tell the people that work there.
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000]  One of the biggest pools in the country.
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:46.000]  They won't even tell them.
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:50.000]  This just shows how there's this culture of never, never talking to the slaves.
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:51.000]  Go ahead.
[02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:55.000]  And they have some of the information posted on the Barton Springs Public Process website,
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:56.000]  but it's extremely limited.
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:00.000]  It's one-line sentences about how it's going to be closed during October.
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:05.000]  Partially, the deep end will be open, but it's going to be definitely closed all winter.
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:10.000]  It's supposed to be open again in time for March for the swimmers to come back in spring,
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:14.000]  but they have a budget to extend that construction process pretty much indefinitely.
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000]  Well, they're always going to take over.
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:21.000]  When they're done, they'll have it just for UT alumni.
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:24.000]  They'll have a stupid Bevo sign because the UT's involved.
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:28.000]  But to write, it's a big project for UT graduate students to prove they can do engineering
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000]  and it's their chance at a big practical project.
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:35.000]  Also, I went to the other city-fed pool and the cops had taken it over yesterday.
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000]  I mean, it's just there's no, this country's just gone.
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  I mean, it's just anything good they'll wreck it.
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:42.000]  And they're now announcing they will have TSA on the streets of Austin.
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  And I guarantee they're going to be there wanting to graduate genitals.
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:46.000]  Where are you going?
[02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:47.000]  I mean, it's this country.
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:48.000]  This is their takeover.
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:49.000]  This is their time of evil.
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:50.000]  And it's not even needed.
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000]  It's just another big rip-off boondog.
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000]  We need to look into the construction companies getting the money.
[02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000]  I want UT out of there.
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000]  They'll have your Formula One, okay?
[02:50:58.000 --> 02:50:59.000]  I already have to pay for that.
[02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:00.000]  You trash.
[02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:29.000]  Talk about only get back.
[02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:06.000]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body
[02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000]  and rebuilding the immune system.
[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:12.000]  Micro-plant powder can help unclog arteries and soften heart valves
[02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:16.000]  while removing heavy metals, virus, fungus, bacteria, and parasites.
[02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:20.000]  Plus, it cleans and purifies the blood, lungs, stomach, and colon.
[02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:23.000]  Keep your body clean with micro-plant powder.
[02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:30.000]  Visit us at hempUSA.org or call 908-6912608 today.
[02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:57.000]  For returns, call 800-686-2237.
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:23.000]  Are you storing food?
[02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:52.000]  Don't be fooled by cheap imitations.
[02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:56.000]  For a discount coupon, visit sonovin.com forward slash radio.
[02:53:56.000 --> 02:54:22.000]  That's sonovin.com forward slash radio.
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:30.000]  It is a bypass for Barton Springs, a bypass from Barton Creek,
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:35.000]  a culvert that goes by it that isn't even affecting the stream,
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:39.000]  and they could literally have a regular construction crew
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  in like two weeks or less redo that.
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:44.000]  I mean, I had construction guys out of my house that built a big giant wall.
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:47.000]  I guarantee you, they could put a new pipe in there in a couple weeks.
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:48.000]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:52.000]  So it's this giant thing with UT involved.
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:53.000]  I'm not bashing UT.
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:54.000]  My whole family went there.
[02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:57.000]  It's just that it's this big, big economic takeover arm.
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:00.000]  And I'm just so sick of it, Aaron, that no one knows.
[02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000]  Like, I go listen to them and hear them go,
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000]  well, it could be 11 months, it could be a year.
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000]  And I go, excuse me, what's going on here?
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:09.000]  Oh, we're shutting down October 1st.
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000]  And then I'm like, oh, why do you want to know?
[02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000]  We're looking for the mermaids.
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000]  And it's like, you know, the head planning commission of the city.
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:16.000]  I'm reading there.
[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000]  I'm just like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm a slave.
[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:21.000]  And then I go up and tell the manager, hey, they're saying they're going to shut down.
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:22.000]  They won't tell us.
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:25.000]  They, because people got mad two years ago when they tried.
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:26.000]  That's why.
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:27.000]  So they're just going to shut the thing down.
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:28.000]  No one knows.
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000]  It's a conspiracy theory, Aaron.
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000]  You've got it all, though, from their own planning commission.
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  I do.
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000]  And the thing is, we talked about this earlier.
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:38.000]  People may not know this pool is swimmable year round.
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:41.000]  It's perfect temperature water all year round, even in the winter.
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:44.000]  But they're going to shut it down, close off public access.
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:48.000]  And whether that culvert's necessary or not, it doesn't look that necessary to me,
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:51.000]  but it has something to do with supposedly rerouting rain.
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000]  And also the safety of one tree's roots.
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000]  Well, that's a separate matter.
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:56.000]  That's a separate boondoggle.
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:00.000]  But just this thing about closing down the pool for the culvert has been going on
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:03.000]  for two or three years because of the environmental concerns.
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:08.000]  Is to get multiple environmental boards to approve of their plans and make sure.
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000]  Oh, they're talking about not even letting humans in it,
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000]  because our sunscreen may hurt the salamanders.
[02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000]  But let's push the basher gobbling.
[02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:17.000]  The project could have been done for a couple hundred thousand dollars,
[02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:18.000]  even if it's necessary.
[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:21.000]  Instead, it's a two or three million plus dollar project.
[02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:24.000]  No, no, no, because it's always about somebody's brother getting our money.
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:25.000]  Yeah.
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000]  And again, this stuff's going on everywhere.
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:28.000]  He ran into the SOS people.
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000]  They're like, look at all the land we've taken around Austin.
[02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:33.000]  And Rob do goes, and you've now built on it.
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:34.000]  She goes, well, yes.
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000]  Yeah, the former city council that did all this took the land.
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000]  They all own it now.
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000]  Literally, they own the banks that finance it.
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  They build on it.
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:42.000]  These people are incredible.
[02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000]  They will shut that place down.
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:45.000]  They will.
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:46.000]  They are just anything good.
[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:47.000]  They will ruin it.
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:48.000]  I'm so sick of government.
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000]  They're the filth of the earth.
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:51.000]  They couldn't tie their shoelaces.
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:52.000]  Well, you mentioned the tree.
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:56.000]  This is at Barton Springs, the beautiful pool with very limited infrastructure.
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:00.000]  It's just a concreted in natural spring, flows right through.
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:03.000]  But they want to save the trees and move the entrance,
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:06.000]  because too many people are walking on the roots of the trees, they say.
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:07.000]  No plans.
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:08.000]  And the trees are completely fine.
[02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000]  Again, humans touching trees is evil.
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000]  It's a power grab.
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:15.000]  Anything good, they're going to rip you off.
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000]  But they have to have $100,000 for this tree.
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:18.000]  Oh, no, they got to charge $5.
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:22.000]  The park, when the park's been paid for forever, and they charge you to get in.
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:23.000]  Yeah.
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000]  All right, Aaron, I'm going to cover more on the nightly news tonight,
[02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:28.000]  because it just shows the sickness.
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000]  But again, no one even knows.
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:33.000]  We were just on the phone with the director, and they don't even know about it.
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:34.000]  They're like, really?
[02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:35.000]  People aren't going to like that?
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:36.000]  Read.
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:37.000]  It's public.
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:38.000]  I got a contact number.
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:39.000]  Nobody would answer the phone.
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:40.000]  I call it three times.
[02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:41.000]  We just sent a dude down there.
[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:44.000]  People were like, hey, Alex, why are you covering this when World War III is about to happen?
[02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:47.000]  It's a microcosm of the mental illness to these people.
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:48.000]  Thank you, Aaron Dykes.
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:49.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:50.000]  Big nightly news tonight.

[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:53.000]  A lot more.
