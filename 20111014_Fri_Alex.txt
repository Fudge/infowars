[00:51.120 --> 00:58.160]  most important transmissions we've ever engaged in in my almost 17 years in
[00:58.160 --> 01:04.400]  radio and TV broadcasting we have Ray McGovern former top CIA analyst
[01:04.400 --> 01:09.760]  Morning Briefer to Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush joining us
[01:09.760 --> 01:13.040]  first coming up in about 30 minutes he of course was on with us a week and a
[01:13.040 --> 01:17.660]  half ago and said the green light is very close to being given the most
[01:17.660 --> 01:24.600]  dangerous point we've ever reached with a giant Israeli US backed attack on Iran
[01:24.600 --> 01:29.160]  and the incredible ramifications of that and of course it's more important
[01:29.160 --> 01:34.200]  than ever with this new plot it's come out that this used car salesman from
[01:34.200 --> 01:41.880]  the Texas coast Corpus Christi was reportedly involved in a drug deal with
[01:41.880 --> 01:46.000]  Los Zetas who publicly worked for the big private fellow reserve banks and
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.600]  that none of this was true there was a informant leading the whole thing who
[01:50.600 --> 01:57.840]  himself talked about the plot to assassinate Santa Claus along with the
[01:57.840 --> 02:04.320]  Saudi Easter Bunny I mean this is absolute total bull and and you see a real
[02:04.320 --> 02:11.120]  shift inside the power structure right now where you've got on info wars.com
[02:11.120 --> 02:15.280]  last night today all these links to mainstream articles when you're on
[02:15.280 --> 02:20.360]  Drudge Report when you're on you know big news sites all over the place there
[02:20.360 --> 02:24.560]  are former Bush administration officials the former Clinton people
[02:24.560 --> 02:29.680]  anti-terrorism experts FBI agents lieutenant Schaefer who's joining us
[02:29.680 --> 02:34.480]  later people are coming out of the woodwork saying this is as phony as a
[02:34.480 --> 02:40.360]  $3 bill and as a pretext to back an Israeli attack on Iran which will help
[02:40.360 --> 02:45.040]  Netanyahu who's in political trouble and he's a political distraction and
[02:45.040 --> 02:54.320]  Obama who is dead political meat when it comes to the issue of fast and furious
[02:54.320 --> 02:59.800]  that's tied into Mexican cartels but now it's Attorney General Holder and FBI
[02:59.800 --> 03:04.360]  Director Mueller they're battling the Mexican cartels who work with those evil
[03:04.360 --> 03:10.200]  Iranians so it's all coming up Robert Baer the big black ops CIA commander
[03:10.200 --> 03:15.600]  he's gone public saying this is totally manufactured and phony in fact I call
[03:15.600 --> 03:18.960]  Paul Watson this morning and he's busy on another article on the TSA but I need
[03:18.960 --> 03:24.400]  to get Steve Watson curtain ammo Aaron Dykes somebody up there at my office to
[03:24.400 --> 03:30.680]  do a report boiling down all the credible top terrorism experts coming out
[03:30.680 --> 03:35.640]  and saying this is totally phony as I told you three days ago when it first
[03:35.640 --> 03:41.720]  broke then yesterday we began to get a clearer image of exactly what was going
[03:41.720 --> 03:46.720]  on and confirmed this is about green lighting they have green lighted the
[03:46.720 --> 03:50.840]  attack just because the lights green doesn't mean Israel is going to go ahead
[03:50.840 --> 03:57.280]  with it but it means that they are going ahead right now with the plan to
[03:57.280 --> 04:02.720]  launch a strike in the next two weeks upon Iran I have this from Pachinic
[04:02.720 --> 04:07.800]  sources I have this from my other military sources I have this by family
[04:07.800 --> 04:12.480]  being deployed to Kuwait and being pretty freaked out about it and other
[04:12.480 --> 04:19.360]  sources saying that it's a strike on Iran a US preparing for a response to a
[04:19.360 --> 04:23.220]  strike on Iran and all the ramifications of that and then of course
[04:23.220 --> 04:26.840]  lieutenant Schaefer coming out and saying this is about a smokescreen for
[04:26.840 --> 04:31.440]  fast and furious and about an Iran strike and that he has a high-level FBI
[04:31.440 --> 04:35.720]  source with the highest security clearance inside the Justice Department
[04:35.720 --> 04:39.560]  this shows you there's a lot of people inside the government like they had a
[04:39.560 --> 04:44.480]  cent com three years ago four years ago Fox Fallon who refused to launch a
[04:44.480 --> 04:48.320]  strike on Iran and had to step down because of it so we'll tell you who's

[10:15.920 --> 10:19.320]  was involved trying to sell marijuana so they just set him up as a complete
[10:19.320 --> 10:23.600]  idiot he reportedly was just a total drunk marijuana head partying
[10:23.600 --> 10:27.720]  constantly just screwing around with Los Zettis and they set him up and it's in
[10:27.720 --> 10:31.720]  the affidavits the articles are at infowars.com and prisonpunna.com like
[10:31.720 --> 10:35.560]  the hundreds of plots we've seen the last few years where they just go out and
[10:35.560 --> 10:39.080]  for either provocateur or complete moron to shoot their mouth off when they're
[10:39.080 --> 10:43.800]  drunk about blowing stuff up yeah I'll take on Tokyo I'll blow up the Capitol

[11:10.960 --> 11:17.360]  along with the fable of 9-11 and it works with the usual suspects this is
[11:17.360 --> 11:21.920]  absolutely asinine a it's about launching a new war against Iran and
[11:21.920 --> 11:26.120]  backing Israel's attack on it creating this this announcement that oh my gosh

[11:41.400 --> 11:46.400]  had WMDs and nukes and yellow cake and just like Manuel Noriega kidnapped US
[11:46.400 --> 11:50.560]  college students turned out that wasn't true I've seen the Panama deception where

[13:13.600 --> 13:17.880]  just everywhere dozens and dozens and dozens of names so I need Kurt Nemo
[13:17.880 --> 13:21.880]  Aaron Dykes Paul Watson Steve Watson whoever wants to take this mission
[13:21.880 --> 13:26.280]  because it's a hard one because it's like picking up seashells at the beach
[13:26.280 --> 13:31.480]  there's so many hundreds of them you have got to go through and just say hoax
[13:31.480 --> 13:39.080]  of Iran terror plot implodes and just go through it all and the good news here is
[13:39.080 --> 13:45.880]  the Pentagon knows that this is not Iraq that it's not Libya the Pentagon knows
[13:45.880 --> 13:51.200]  this is not some cakewalk the Pentagon knows there's 80 million Iranians they
[13:51.200 --> 13:54.920]  lost over a million and a half people fighting the US through the proxy war
[13:54.920 --> 14:02.760]  with Iraq and their 25 million people and the Iranians are focused and ready
[14:02.760 --> 14:06.880]  and are going to launch absolute proxy wars all over the Middle East and
[14:06.880 --> 14:12.160]  Central Asia that is going to probably end up routing out globalist forces that
[14:12.160 --> 14:15.280]  are sitting on top of the five hundred billion dollars a year in opium that our
[14:15.280 --> 14:19.280]  troops publicly grow and cultivate and fly out to run up your daughter and
[14:19.280 --> 14:24.680]  son's veins they know the Iranians are going to just just just totally pull
[14:24.680 --> 14:29.400]  the stops out in proxy wars and yes the globalist will stage bombings here it's
[14:29.400 --> 14:34.160]  not part of the Iranian strategy to strike over here and all the top real
[14:34.160 --> 14:37.640]  terror experts have said that but don't worry the West will blow stuff up here
[14:37.640 --> 14:41.600]  to use as an excuse to take your rights and liberties that's how this all works
[14:41.600 --> 14:45.840]  and so they don't care if it screws up you know even globalist crime
[14:45.840 --> 14:50.280]  operations overseas the system needs this here as a smoke screen from the
[14:50.280 --> 14:55.280]  banker bailout they need this here as a pretext to roll the TSA out on the
[14:55.280 --> 15:03.240]  streets with the new you know spy on your spy on your neighbor programs that
[15:03.240 --> 15:08.240]  are going on all over the place and so they want to have the big prize be
[15:08.240 --> 15:12.840]  totally brought down that's our once free republic remember 90 plus percent of
[15:12.840 --> 15:16.560]  all this homeland security training behind the scenes was always about gun
[15:16.560 --> 15:21.720]  owners landowners people that can skin a buck run a trot line people that are
[15:21.720 --> 15:27.480]  gardening people that don't like war people that don't like GMO anybody on
[15:27.480 --> 15:31.560]  left right or center who's awake to anything is the enemy behind the scenes
[15:31.560 --> 15:34.920]  I've been telling you that for a decade now they've come out public and said
[15:34.920 --> 15:40.000]  it's no longer al-qaeda it's white people it's white people and they have all
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.520]  these TV ads were all the terrorists are white the minorities report them so
[15:44.520 --> 15:47.360]  they've already demonized and gotten white folks to go along with giving up
[15:47.360 --> 15:50.480]  their rights because you know oh it's the brown people supposedly they're
[15:50.480 --> 15:55.680]  gonna get us that's that tribalism that racism now they're shifting and going to
[15:55.680 --> 16:00.080]  all the other folks and saying no it's whitey they're going to get you so
[16:00.080 --> 16:04.400]  basically everybody's a terrorist and I told you all this was coming and I told
[16:04.400 --> 16:08.800]  you with Obama falling like a shooting star and imploding and burning down and
[16:08.800 --> 16:13.760]  his own party calling for him to step down and not run again that I said he's
[16:13.760 --> 16:17.600]  got a month or two I said this last week I said he's got a month or two for a
[16:17.600 --> 16:22.480]  false flag or a new war some big crisis to make him look strong as all his
[16:22.480 --> 16:27.920]  advisors are telling him he's got a month or two max or they're gonna go ahead
[16:27.920 --> 16:33.640]  and removing I mean I know what's in their playbook I said they could also do
[16:33.640 --> 16:38.320]  a failed assassination attempt I've said assassination attempts are the false
[16:38.320 --> 16:42.760]  flag as well we even wrote articles about it earlier this year and last year
[16:42.760 --> 16:47.040]  Paul Watson pointed out yesterday predicting this type of garbage so
[16:47.040 --> 16:52.200]  notice you're here about assassination attempts now against the Saudi you know
[16:52.200 --> 16:58.280]  US ambassador now when we come back from break I want to tell you about TSA suicide
[16:58.280 --> 17:03.200]  squads you heard me write TSA suicide squads I want to tell you about that
[17:03.200 --> 17:09.960]  that's a shocking term that's actually what they are so we have some breaking
[17:09.960 --> 17:19.000]  news on TSA suicide squads now when I came up here yesterday I have amazing
[17:19.000 --> 17:24.000]  military sources and then I'll also put it out open source to the general
[17:24.000 --> 17:31.480]  public and I know that Israel has been saying last month they probably are
[17:31.480 --> 17:34.480]  gonna go into Iran and start the bombardment the bunker busters have been
[17:34.480 --> 17:37.880]  shipped over there the cluster bombs to knock out their airfields so they can't
[17:37.880 --> 17:42.960]  launch retaliatory strikes on Israel those have all been delivered more US
[17:42.960 --> 17:47.560]  troops have been rotating and massing in Kuwait and other areas out of Iraq as
[17:47.560 --> 17:52.520]  the next staging ground to go into Iran because they don't want to launch an
[17:52.520 --> 17:58.240]  attack if it's needed into Iran into strategic ports and other areas out of
[17:58.240 --> 18:02.560]  Iraq because of that would elicit those old feuds it'll be out of Kuwait and
[18:02.560 --> 18:06.560]  other areas and of course US forces wouldn't go into the hole of Iran they
[18:06.560 --> 18:13.800]  would go in and hold the mountains of the the the passes over some of the
[18:13.800 --> 18:19.320]  different straits that are needed like Hormuz to bring the oil back and forth
[18:19.320 --> 18:24.120]  or to remove and and dredge that out of the Iranians sink a bunch of ships in
[18:24.120 --> 18:27.220]  there like they've said they're gonna do there's also gonna be the need to
[18:27.220 --> 18:32.760]  launch out of Kuwait and other airfields attacks on Iran so all of that is
[18:32.760 --> 18:39.480]  going on and you've got the anti-Shiite Saudi Arabia totally behind this saying
[18:39.480 --> 18:44.360]  we want the response we want it to be launched now we've got Obama says he's
[18:44.360 --> 18:50.240]  gonna have a tough response on Iran's role in alleged plot now again this is
[18:50.240 --> 18:55.880]  already admitted to be a fake plot but the military the brass just like Fox
[18:55.880 --> 19:00.120]  Fallon knew as I said three four years ago it was almost five years ago when
[19:00.120 --> 19:04.040]  they ordered the head of sent come to attack Iran and claim that PT boats out
[19:04.040 --> 19:07.600]  of Iran had tried to attack them we later learned he knew the chain he had
[19:07.600 --> 19:12.040]  boats painted up out there wasn't just he was chaining was wanting it as New
[19:12.040 --> 19:15.480]  Yorker magazine reported they staged some boats coming up saying we're gonna
[19:15.480 --> 19:20.600]  blow you up to try to then order Fallon to attack Iran Fallon refused had to
[19:20.600 --> 19:25.240]  resign not because the Pentagon doesn't like war not because the Pentagon
[19:25.240 --> 19:29.320]  doesn't like opium out of Afghanistan but because they know the politicians
[19:29.320 --> 19:34.880]  strategically are biting off more than they can chew and that and that this is
[19:34.880 --> 19:41.000]  gonna get out of hand very very quickly and so that's why you now see and hear
[19:41.000 --> 19:47.320]  all these people top terrorism officials CIA people Pentagon folks military all
[19:47.320 --> 19:51.920]  coming out saying this whole plot is a fraud and a hoax because they realize
[19:51.920 --> 19:55.960]  how serious it is if Israel launches this attack what Panetta came back 10
[19:55.960 --> 19:59.800]  days ago 11 days ago from Israel and said Israel is totally isolated they're

[24:33.040 --> 24:39.360]  is not real it's as fake as pyrite is compared to 24 karat gold it is
[24:39.360 --> 24:44.640]  garbage it is a hoax he's going to be joining us over the hoax show his
[24:44.640 --> 24:49.720]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer he's saying total hoax with FBI sources
[24:49.720 --> 24:54.840]  confirming it we have Gerald Salente who predicted they'd stage a new war as
[24:54.840 --> 24:58.960]  Obama imploded in the global depression came into place he predicted that three
[24:58.960 --> 25:02.960]  years ago as Bob Chapman myself and many others did that's a default position for
[25:02.960 --> 25:07.680]  the globalist Gerald Salente is joining us in the Dr. Steve Pacenek you can say
[25:07.680 --> 25:10.920]  what you want about Pacenek he's obviously establishment he tells you up
[25:10.920 --> 25:16.040]  front he represents Pentagon he called me up yesterday the phone ring like ten
[25:16.040 --> 25:19.840]  times before I went and answered it because I was running on the treadmill my
[25:19.840 --> 25:22.840]  wife came out so this just rang eight times it rang two more times so I
[25:22.840 --> 25:27.520]  answered it and he's like listen they're getting ready to launch a war Israel's
[25:27.520 --> 25:31.520]  going to do it I've got the sources as you know you know Alex I do you know
[25:31.520 --> 25:35.080]  important work and I care about this country and I want you to know that the
[25:35.080 --> 25:38.600]  different people in the intelligence organizations really appreciate you and
[25:38.600 --> 25:44.160]  you know we're not all bad and don't want this war so I mean look at it you've
[25:44.160 --> 25:48.040]  got Bush administration people coming out of the woodwork Clinton people coming
[25:48.040 --> 25:53.280]  out you've got Pentagon people coming out you've got people that wrote the book on
[25:53.280 --> 25:58.120]  black ops coming out you got Ray McGovern coming out because the green
[25:58.120 --> 26:03.600]  light right now has been given and then they just manufactured this story of oh
[26:03.600 --> 26:09.040]  look the used car salesman was going to do all this with the Iranian secret
[26:09.040 --> 26:14.320]  military now people think well this is shoddy well it was shoddy when they
[26:14.320 --> 26:18.360]  claimed that Manuel Noriega had kidnapped some college girls in Panama
[26:18.360 --> 26:22.840]  City at an American University there turned out it was a fraud but back then
[26:22.840 --> 26:27.320]  there wasn't an internet it was a fraud of the WMD's they got caught didn't care
[26:27.320 --> 26:32.600]  they don't care if they get caught they just need an excuse at the time but now
[26:32.600 --> 26:39.280]  all their own people are coming out because it's more and more transparent and
[26:39.280 --> 26:46.120]  also the a lot of the establishment does not want to hit Iran they know it's
[26:46.120 --> 26:49.640]  like Hitler turning in the middle of World War two east towards Russia or
[26:49.640 --> 26:55.200]  Napoleon doing it it's biting off more than they can shoot and you had the
[26:55.200 --> 26:59.960]  former head of the Mossad two weeks ago come out and say do not attack Iran
[26:59.960 --> 27:04.880]  Netanyahu do not do it do not do it do not do it so it's not monolithic Israel
[27:04.880 --> 27:11.080]  wants this either okay this is really bad news even if you're an evil insider
[27:11.080 --> 27:14.600]  you know there's a lot of the insiders who don't want to be part of this because
[27:14.600 --> 27:19.760]  it's really bad the Pentagon bucked Bush and Cheney on this that's all come out
[27:19.760 --> 27:24.400]  now Cheney admits in his memoir in my time that he wanted to hit Iran and the
[27:24.400 --> 27:28.160]  Pentagon and others didn't want to do it because the Pentagon is not a draft
[27:28.160 --> 27:33.400]  deferment guy like Cheney or or Bush you know getting out of the
[27:33.400 --> 27:39.640]  Air National Guard or Obama or Hillary or any of these people or Netanyahu for
[27:39.640 --> 27:46.120]  that matter you know his brother was a war hero but not not Netanyahu Netanyahu
[27:46.120 --> 27:50.120]  is only famous because his brother got killed in a commando raid saving some
[27:50.120 --> 27:55.760]  hostages the point is that this does not need to happen and it's gonna make oil
[27:55.760 --> 28:01.600]  prices explode it's gonna be really bad news now I told you that I was going to
[28:01.600 --> 28:08.160]  tell you about TSA suicide squads you heard me right TSA suicide squads I
[28:08.160 --> 28:14.200]  want to really try to get the the TSA's attention on this subject so but I can't

[33:24.600 --> 33:29.880]  food is unfit to eat we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells
[33:29.880 --> 33:34.560]  us of today we had 15 homicides of 63 violent crimes as if that's the way it's
[33:34.560 --> 33:39.440]  supposed to be we know things are bad worse than bad they're crazy it's like
[33:39.440 --> 33:43.120]  everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore we sit in the
[33:43.120 --> 33:46.560]  house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is
[33:46.560 --> 33:50.840]  please at least leave us alone in our living rooms let me have my toaster and
[33:50.840 --> 33:54.800]  my TV and my steel belt and radios and I won't say anything just leave us alone

[34:05.880 --> 34:09.040]  do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in
[34:09.040 --> 34:13.320]  the street all I know is that first you've got to get mad you've got to say
[34:13.320 --> 34:21.880]  I'm a human being my life has value I want you to get up now I want all of you

[34:35.120 --> 34:40.200]  all right I want you to get up right now I want you to get up and let the
[34:40.200 --> 34:44.440]  establishment know you're not putting up with what's happening thank you so much
[34:44.440 --> 34:49.040]  for joining us now we're joined by Ray McGovern former top CA analyst to
[34:49.040 --> 34:53.480]  Ronald Reagan George Herbert Walker Bush their morning briefer of course has a
[34:53.480 --> 34:57.760]  lot of context inside intelligence to this day and we've also had Steve
[34:57.760 --> 35:02.380]  Pachennick call me yesterday and say yes his sources have told him that they
[35:02.380 --> 35:06.720]  are planning Israel is planning to strike I also have family in the military
[35:06.720 --> 35:09.840]  who've been shipped to Kuwait and they're not talking I called some other
[35:09.840 --> 35:13.680]  military sources one of them got upset and said don't call me about this Alex
[35:13.680 --> 35:17.960]  I'm not talking to you and how do you know this stuff well it's pretty obvious
[35:17.960 --> 35:23.280]  now Congressman King has labeled Iran terror plot act of war says Obama should
[35:23.280 --> 35:28.760]  have troops on standby and of course Panetta came back two weeks ago week and
[35:28.760 --> 35:34.360]  a half ago and said I guess 11 days go to be technical the head of the Pentagon
[35:34.360 --> 35:37.640]  Secretary of Defense and said well Israel's on their own now they're
[35:37.640 --> 35:42.800]  isolated they've given them the bunker busters the cluster bombs this Ray McGovern
[35:42.800 --> 35:46.040]  was on a week and a half ago and he said this is the closest we've been to a
[35:46.040 --> 35:51.200]  hit on Iran and now you've got Bob bear the former black op field commander
[35:51.200 --> 35:55.640]  coming out saying it's phony Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer talked to a
[35:55.640 --> 35:59.320]  high-level FBI they say it's totally made up that there is nothing in the
[35:59.320 --> 36:03.960]  system on it you've got former Bush administration officials the the we've
[36:03.960 --> 36:08.440]  got articles on info wars calm about this the top expert on the Persian
[36:08.440 --> 36:12.640]  saying this is totally fake it turns out we've got the affidavit now the
[36:12.640 --> 36:16.640]  informant said all this up the guy was trying to make a drug deal the car dealer
[36:16.640 --> 36:22.800]  reportedly not involved in anything an alcoholic pothead and now they're saying
[36:22.800 --> 36:27.240]  more plots are coming out this is a way to cover up fast and furious as well a
[36:27.240 --> 36:33.920]  perfect storm it looks like Israeli APAC elements for my sources are basically
[36:33.920 --> 36:37.600]  blackmailing Obama this is kind of what McGovern said he said they're going to
[36:37.600 --> 36:40.880]  politically destroy him if he doesn't go ahead with this and there's they're
[36:40.880 --> 36:44.520]  often and the neocons are pressuring saying this is how you get reelected
[36:44.520 --> 36:48.560]  we'll get behind you so the big usual Republican suspects are behind it you
[36:48.560 --> 36:53.280]  got that perfect storm neocons Republicans Israel folks some of the
[36:53.280 --> 36:57.120]  defense manufacturers not the actual Defense Department but the entire
[36:57.120 --> 37:01.280]  Defense Department from my sources that are pretty high-level public and not
[37:01.280 --> 37:05.880]  public say that the Pentagon just like Fox Fallon four and a half years ago said
[37:05.880 --> 37:10.720]  no is saying do not do this and and another person telling us do not do
[37:10.720 --> 37:14.400]  this is Ray McGovern so Ray thank you for joining us I wanted to give some
[37:14.400 --> 37:19.280]  background but my intel is a hundred percent they green lighted it that doesn't
[37:19.280 --> 37:23.600]  mean it's going to happen but they are testing the trial balloons if the if this
[37:23.600 --> 37:29.520]  con job sells they're planning to hit Iran sooner rather than later what is
[37:29.520 --> 37:36.360]  your intel Ray McGovern well Alex I'm glad to be back with you here I guess I
[37:36.360 --> 37:42.360]  would start by saying that this cockamamie plot that does not test the
[37:42.360 --> 37:49.920]  smell test I was amused if you can be amused by such things by Hillary
[37:49.920 --> 38:01.640]  Clinton saying you know you can make this stuff up well yes you can and it was
[38:01.640 --> 38:08.840]  just yesterday that the information came out from oh from David Ignatius who has
[38:08.840 --> 38:14.320]  a column in the Washington Post he's so close to CIA operatives that he pretty
[38:14.320 --> 38:20.440]  much acts as their surrogate spokesman and what he let out of the we let out of
[38:20.440 --> 38:26.920]  the bag was the fact that as he put it justice and White House officials were
[38:26.920 --> 38:35.080]  pretty skeptical you know they they considered this pretty flimsy until
[38:35.080 --> 38:43.160]  CIA to the rescue General Petraeus was able to gather information from inside
[38:43.160 --> 38:48.840]  Iran mind you that was so confirmatory that it then credence to this and the
[38:48.840 --> 38:56.680]  impossible all of a sudden became plausible well give me a break if you
[38:56.680 --> 39:02.080]  look closely at this you know used car salesman Mexican drug cartel plot to
[39:02.080 --> 39:07.280]  assassinate the Saudi ambassador to Washington and not only doesn't pass the
[39:07.280 --> 39:11.680]  smell that doesn't pass the comic book test they would never sell the Hollywood
[39:11.680 --> 39:19.000]  because it's just too far-fetched now why sir because in my experience which is
[39:19.000 --> 39:24.240]  limited compared to yours I've never seen though so many known Pentagon spokes
[39:24.240 --> 39:30.760]  people like like like the Chenex Schaefer this top Bush administration
[39:30.760 --> 39:36.120]  expert who's come out I mean they're Robert Bayer there's so many of them
[39:36.120 --> 39:39.920]  that I've never seen such a chorus even the New York Times said this doesn't
[39:39.920 --> 39:44.240]  pass the smell test why is such a large segment of the establishment and the
[39:44.240 --> 39:50.280]  Pentagon saying this is total fraud well you took the words out of my mouth and
[39:50.280 --> 39:55.760]  citing the New York Times now the New York Times has never ever ever been
[39:55.760 --> 40:00.160]  skeptical about what any administration's spokesperson has said about Iran
[40:00.160 --> 40:06.240]  Iran is black Iran is this is you know the the devil incarnate so for the New
[40:06.240 --> 40:12.600]  York Times to be casting doubt on these reports is really a new step forward for
[40:12.600 --> 40:19.240]  them I mean it it shows to me at least that for once somebody some adult at the
[40:19.240 --> 40:23.400]  New York Times said hey wait a second you know let's not get on board this one
[40:23.400 --> 40:30.080]  after our experience with Iraq this just smells even worse now I just mentioned
[40:30.080 --> 40:35.640]  our experience with Iraq now that was when we veteran intelligence
[40:35.640 --> 40:40.080]  professionals decided to form our little group for sanity because we could see
[40:40.080 --> 40:46.080]  that not only the operatives on the other side of the house but the analysts
[40:46.080 --> 40:51.120]  themselves were being prostituted were being corrupted were being forced to
[40:51.120 --> 40:56.760]  tell a story that was not true now take the story about Saddam Hussein's ties
[40:56.760 --> 41:04.320]  alleged ties with al-Qaeda okay nobody believed that they were at loggerheads
[41:04.320 --> 41:11.040]  between the two of them but evidence was was procured now it didn't suffice to
[41:11.040 --> 41:16.840]  have Doug fight than Donald Rumsfeld's and Wolfowitz's guys in the Pentagon to
[41:16.840 --> 41:22.040]  come up with this faux intelligence no no they needed something better and what
[41:22.040 --> 41:27.880]  most people don't realize is that the first big reason for the torture okay
[41:27.880 --> 41:33.600]  for the torture of all those folks down at Gitmo and at Abu Ghraib was to get
[41:33.600 --> 41:39.520]  somebody somebody to quote admit and quote that al-Qaeda was being trained
[41:39.520 --> 41:46.920]  being run by Saddam Hussein and that's why Alibi the Libyan terrorist who was
[41:46.920 --> 41:51.320]  apprehended and knew nothing more than how to you know arrange flights into the
[41:51.320 --> 41:56.880]  training camps of al-Qaeda while he was sent to Egypt and the Egyptians got him
[41:56.880 --> 42:03.000]  to quote confess and quote that there were indeed ties between Hussein and
[42:03.000 --> 42:09.600]  al-Qaeda and that the Iraqis which right training the the al-Qaeda people in the
[42:09.600 --> 42:15.400]  use of chemical and other weapons of mass destruction and of course sir it
[42:15.400 --> 42:19.880]  turned out that all wasn't true and KSM also confessed to bombing buildings that
[42:19.880 --> 42:24.760]  weren't built until after he'd been in custody for many years of waterboarding
[42:24.760 --> 42:29.960]  but what does it signify though is this good news that so many even
[42:29.960 --> 42:33.560]  establishment insiders have come out saying this is a lie because in the
[42:33.560 --> 42:38.640]  past they would go along as you said with any lie does this show that maybe
[42:38.640 --> 42:43.600]  certain elements tried to green light it and you know now they're saying don't
[42:43.600 --> 42:47.480]  worry we've got more Iranian plots and now we've got congressman King saying
[42:47.480 --> 42:52.400]  active war get the troops ready because the info I've got and I've got family
[42:52.400 --> 42:55.200]  and logistics they didn't tell me I know they've been sent over there but I know
[42:55.200 --> 42:59.120]  other military sources they've been told yeah get ready to back up the Israelis
[42:59.120 --> 43:04.520]  during an Iranian response get ready to drag stuff out of the Strait of Hormuz
[43:04.520 --> 43:08.760]  all the things you've talked about here for years you predicted you said if I
[43:08.760 --> 43:14.120]  was Cheney knowing him he'll probably try to attack our destroyers around the
[43:14.120 --> 43:18.640]  Strait of Hormuz then it came out he did propose painting up US boats like blue
[43:18.640 --> 43:25.120]  patrol boats so so so you've been able to really look into their mind for me it's
[43:25.120 --> 43:30.000]  positive to see people rejecting this pretty much across the board but it
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.280]  doesn't matter the pro-war people it looks like you're just going ahead with
[43:33.280 --> 43:37.440]  it what is your intel I mean a what does it signify to have folks not buying it
[43:37.440 --> 43:41.880]  be are we on the razor's edge you said a week and a half ago they were moving
[43:41.880 --> 43:46.560]  towards green light where is it right now well those are good questions Alex and
[43:46.560 --> 43:51.720]  I would say there's good news and there's bad news the good news is the evidence
[43:51.720 --> 43:56.640]  that you would use that everybody and his brother and sister who knows anything
[43:56.640 --> 44:02.440]  about Iran thinks that this is a cockamamie plot okay invented that's
[44:02.440 --> 44:06.640]  the good news and people are speaking out as you say even the New York Times now
[44:06.640 --> 44:11.800]  the bad news is that the president himself I mean it's bad enough that the
[44:11.800 --> 44:18.640]  Secretary of State who famously called for obliterating Iran it's bad enough to
[44:18.640 --> 44:25.040]  Hillary Clinton and that cats poor Eric Holder who was supposed to be our chief
[44:25.040 --> 44:29.080]  law enforcement official the Attorney General bad enough that they come out
[44:29.080 --> 44:34.680]  and they make these allegations but Barack Obama is now on record as saying
[44:34.680 --> 44:38.400]  there has to be accountability and he always tries to have it both ways I
[44:38.400 --> 44:42.040]  don't know if you recognize that but but he got up there was a yes everything's
[44:42.040 --> 44:45.680]  on the table but now but now we're trying to work out they're really bad
[44:45.680 --> 44:51.320]  sanctions so that we can put we can make these radiance behave better and so
[44:51.320 --> 44:56.920]  forth so so the clear body language and everything else was sort of yes but no
[44:56.920 --> 45:01.960]  sort of like yes we're gonna send 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan but no we're
[45:01.960 --> 45:06.120]  gonna bring them out now eight months late give me a break the guy is a guy
[45:06.120 --> 45:12.680]  has no backbone and you know he's an incredibly naive to take his face value
[45:12.680 --> 45:19.760]  the plot such as this ginned up by John Brennan ex CIA who runs his counter
[45:19.760 --> 45:23.840]  terrorism program in the White House he's been burned so many times that is
[45:23.840 --> 45:28.280]  Obama has been that you would think they didn't get some sense I think it's more
[45:28.280 --> 45:35.520]  a case of Obama pandering what's the word unconscionably to the Lee Kudlop in
[45:35.520 --> 45:40.920]  this country it's an election year coming up he feels that he needs to show
[45:40.920 --> 45:45.720]  himself even more pro-Israel than some of the Republican candidates which is
[45:45.720 --> 45:50.560]  quite a stress and I think that's what puts it play here with the danger is the
[45:50.560 --> 45:55.840]  danger is that he'll get into a position put in the maneuvered into that
[45:55.840 --> 46:02.360]  position by the likes of Netanyahu who believes without you know with considerable
[46:02.360 --> 46:08.000]  evidence that if Netanyahu were to perpetrate a strike or to the way they
[46:08.000 --> 46:12.840]  would do it is not a provocation that they would say Iran did X and Y and Z to
[46:12.840 --> 46:17.320]  them and the Israelis had to retaliate if there was a war that broke out there
[46:17.320 --> 46:23.840]  Netanyahu is 99.4 percent sure that Barack Obama would have neither the
[46:23.840 --> 46:29.640]  guts nor the political courage to do anything other than to send those troops
[46:29.640 --> 46:33.280]  out there to help the to help the Israelis or his cruise missiles well
[46:33.280 --> 46:36.040]  no that's my that's my next point obviously you're getting the same
[46:36.040 --> 46:39.760]  information the military officers I talked to are being told get ready to
[46:39.760 --> 46:43.600]  defend Israel and that and that and for the first time this is going on the
[46:43.600 --> 46:46.360]  table and of course knowing these officers for years they're always
[46:46.360 --> 46:50.720]  horrified you know they say yeah no no Iran's really bad news we don't want to
[46:50.720 --> 46:54.760]  get into this and that's my next issue who really runs this country then I
[46:54.760 --> 46:59.560]  mean clearly correct me if I'm wrong the mainline Pentagon is is putting noises
[46:59.560 --> 47:03.120]  out don't do it don't do it we had the former massage chiefs just a few weeks
[47:03.120 --> 47:07.200]  ago as you know came out and said to be crazy to attack Iran so Israel's not
[47:07.200 --> 47:13.040]  even of one mind why is so much of the power structure so against hitting Iran
[47:13.040 --> 47:18.240]  what do they know that the Likudniks and the neocons and representative King
[47:18.240 --> 47:24.920]  don't know well they know it was like Alex and that's a big E okay you look
[47:24.920 --> 47:29.200]  around Obama and see if there's anybody around there that really knows what war
[47:29.200 --> 47:34.480]  is like he did have a guy with some integrity and that the guy's name was
[47:34.480 --> 47:39.280]  Mike Mullen he was chairman of the Genshi's staff and you may recall him
[47:39.280 --> 47:44.520]  going to Israel many times and coming back and holding press conferences and
[47:44.520 --> 47:49.320]  saying I told the Israelis that it'll be really really a dumb thing to widen
[47:49.320 --> 47:54.120]  the war in the Middle East I told them that they could you know they could
[47:54.120 --> 47:59.000]  really perpetrate an escalation nobody wants and then somebody asked them well
[47:59.000 --> 48:05.200]  Admiral Mullen couldn't the Iranians steal off the the Strait of Hormuz and
[48:05.200 --> 48:11.920]  and and prevent 30% of the oil in in public trade from getting out you know
[48:11.920 --> 48:17.280]  well yeah they could that's what I'm and then you do well oh yeah but we could
[48:17.280 --> 48:21.720]  reopen it yeah well how are they gonna reopen the Strait of Hormuz well
[48:21.720 --> 48:25.960]  there are about 200 guided missile patrol boats that would sink their ships
[48:25.960 --> 48:30.360]  and where are they gonna get the Marines to climb those cliffs so Mullen knew
[48:30.360 --> 48:35.000]  which end was up and so did Admiral Fallon who famously told my colleague
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.800]  when I'm gonna do Iran on my watch and get fired for it the problem is they're
[48:39.800 --> 48:45.880]  gone they're gone and what we have now is a bureaucrat as Secretary of Defense
[48:45.880 --> 48:51.160]  and I don't know about this new general who's head of the of the Joint Chiefs
[48:51.160 --> 48:55.720]  of Staff but I knew that the fellow who was in line for it caught right was
[48:55.720 --> 49:01.200]  rejected mostly by my friend Bobby Gates because court right was judged to be
[49:01.200 --> 49:06.800]  not quite always with the program not quite knee-jerkings not quite
[49:06.800 --> 49:12.520]  saluting as smartly and as quickly as we expect the military to do so my my
[49:12.520 --> 49:17.880]  suggestion is that the the people that prevent it and this is demonstrable
[49:17.880 --> 49:22.680]  Alex I think I've mentioned this before I can demonstrate anyone can just by
[49:22.680 --> 49:27.600]  reading Bush's book Bush's memoir himself that we were close to over the
[49:27.600 --> 49:35.360]  run in the end of 2007 and the end of 2008 and in a nutshell what prevented
[49:35.360 --> 49:41.160]  that was an honest that's the good news there were honest CIA analysts around
[49:41.160 --> 49:45.360]  then they did an honest estimate and came to the conclusion that Iran had
[49:45.360 --> 49:51.640]  stopped working on a nuclear weapon at the end of 2003 so four hours four years
[49:51.640 --> 49:56.880]  before then sure sure but now sure but here's my final question the time we
[49:56.880 --> 50:01.320]  have Ray if people can read more what you're writing at consortium news dot
[50:01.320 --> 50:06.080]  com but but expanding on this has the green light been given because what I've
[50:06.080 --> 50:10.300]  been told is the green light Israel said we're going to try to see if they can
[50:10.300 --> 50:15.120]  drag the US along and then a lot of the administration tried to sell this Iran
[50:15.120 --> 50:19.440]  thing as a way to try to sell the public and that if we don't get the word out on
[50:19.440 --> 50:22.520]  this being a fraud they're gonna go ahead with the attack is that what you're
[50:22.520 --> 50:28.640]  getting yes Obama is playing with fire here and I don't think he realizes it
[50:28.640 --> 50:33.680]  he's not in control here is real is and everything as I've said before it
[50:33.680 --> 50:39.240]  depends on how much of a wimp how politically boxed in Netanyahu thinks
[50:39.240 --> 50:44.480]  the president is and whether Netanyahu can face down his own generals and his
[50:44.480 --> 50:49.760]  own heads of the former head so much side all right that it's crazy all right

[54:10.120 --> 54:14.720]  folks we are back live with tenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer is coming up
[54:14.720 --> 54:22.080]  Gerald Salente Dr. Steve Pachennick and others today listen I told you that by
[54:22.080 --> 54:26.240]  September they try to launch overthrow Gaddafi on the ground and they did have
[54:26.240 --> 54:29.960]  US forces and NATO forces there it happened because I have sources at
[54:29.960 --> 54:38.000]  Fort Hood and other places I told you that Cheney and Soda McGovern told you
[54:38.000 --> 54:42.440]  he was planning a fake PT boat attack exactly that happened now McGovern would
[54:42.440 --> 54:47.480]  say oh he just had a feeling no McGovern had sources okay and he's so
[54:47.480 --> 54:53.120]  smooth he'll just say oh I just had a prediction we've been very close to this
[54:53.120 --> 54:57.020]  war look at all the other wars we've seen and what they do is they wear you
[54:57.020 --> 55:02.120]  out and just get you to where you almost just say get it over with but they
[55:02.120 --> 55:05.880]  want to go into Iran right now as a political diversion globally to the
[55:05.880 --> 55:10.760]  banker bailouts to the world depression to all of this we are in an
[55:10.760 --> 55:14.800]  incredible position right now and the fact that you see so many prominent
[55:14.800 --> 55:21.280]  people coming out from the Pentagon you name it the CIA saying this is bull you
[55:21.280 --> 55:28.800]  never see that is because this is so real that's very hardening to because as
[55:28.800 --> 55:32.040]  crazy as the establishment is that there's a lot of different camps in it
[55:32.040 --> 55:40.520]  that are not completely insane now I told you that the TSA basically was the
[55:40.520 --> 55:45.280]  term I use TSA suicide squads this morning I was thinking of a way to
[55:45.280 --> 55:49.800]  reach out to these TSA people because they're human beings like us and I know
[55:49.800 --> 55:52.800]  I've confirmed they call them behind closed doors and they say you concern
[55:52.800 --> 55:56.280]  about radiation from the machines and the x-rays and they say yes they give
[55:56.280 --> 55:59.120]  them a pink slip two weeks later or if they don't want to grow up small
[55:59.120 --> 56:04.920]  children's genitals they get fired so they're creating an army of people that
[56:04.920 --> 56:12.440]  are crazy and Boston is the airport where they tested passive MRIs eight years
[56:12.440 --> 56:17.200]  ago or the eight years ago they put the body standards in first Boston Logan is
[56:17.200 --> 56:21.200]  the main beta testing ground there's four other airports that do it but it's
[56:21.200 --> 56:27.800]  the main one and now they're started here's USA today in Boston airport
[56:27.800 --> 56:31.760]  security now begins with a chat a chat and they ask you where you go and what
[56:31.760 --> 56:35.240]  you're doing it's all part of training you to be a prisoner for domestic
[56:35.240 --> 56:38.760]  checkpoints it's all part of training you that you're a bad person that you're
[56:38.760 --> 56:43.400]  guilty until proven innocent what about asking them hey statistically a lot of
[56:43.400 --> 56:47.240]  you are pedophiles and thieves and criminals let me have a chat with you
[56:47.240 --> 56:50.480]  TSA how do I know you're not going to rob my bags well they'll just say you're
[56:50.480 --> 56:53.640]  not going to fly they're God it's a federal power grab outside their
[56:53.640 --> 56:57.200]  jurisdiction it's always more more more starts will take your shoes off take
[56:57.200 --> 57:00.400]  your belt off now we're going to grab your genitals and in the article they
[57:00.400 --> 57:04.320]  admit we're going to grab your genitals we're going to grope you we're going to
[57:04.320 --> 57:07.600]  put you through scanners and we're going to question all of you and they say this
[57:07.600 --> 57:11.360]  is in a response to you not liking the groping now we'll just do all of it
[57:11.360 --> 57:15.760]  maybe cut back on some of it no they do it all this is how they're breaking
[57:15.760 --> 57:20.680]  America's will but this is why I call it suicide squad it turns out that for
[57:20.680 --> 57:25.480]  eight years they have cancer clusters depending on top of cancer three to eight
[57:25.480 --> 57:32.320]  times the national average and major universities this is what liars the TSA
[57:32.320 --> 57:36.560]  and Homeland Security are last year as you know and earlier this year they came
[57:36.560 --> 57:41.000]  out and said John Hopkins has found that these are totally safe and they had a
[57:41.000 --> 57:45.880]  John Hopkins radiology came out and said my study said massive cancer increase
[57:45.880 --> 57:50.400]  and by the way you better wear lead lead shielded goggles it's going to give you
[57:50.400 --> 57:56.840]  cataracts a few exposures a year will do it in their studies these people and all
[57:56.840 --> 57:59.360]  the studies they wouldn't release to Congress ended up getting leaked and
[57:59.360 --> 58:05.080]  came out that the people around it are being baked you idiots my dad's a
[58:05.080 --> 58:07.880]  dentist when he x-rays somebody with a low power x-ray he gets behind a lead
[58:07.880 --> 58:13.480]  wall he puts lead over their chest and genitals over their front a chest edge
[58:13.480 --> 58:18.000]  raise a lot more powerful than that I watched the military in inside the U.S.
[58:18.000 --> 58:23.320]  now at checkpoints on Fox News you have a clip of it an upstate New York having
[58:23.320 --> 58:27.560]  families drive under whole car x-rays all the military stands out under it I
[58:27.560 --> 58:36.880]  mean those people are walking dead so so these are literally literally TSA
[58:36.880 --> 58:50.680]  suicide squads this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network this is
[58:50.680 --> 58:54.040]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[58:54.040 --> 58:58.000]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[58:58.000 --> 59:02.240]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[59:02.240 --> 59:06.520]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[59:06.520 --> 59:10.920]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[59:10.920 --> 59:14.960]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[59:14.960 --> 59:19.560]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.560 --> 59:23.680]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.680 --> 59:27.640]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[59:27.640 --> 59:31.480]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:31.480 --> 59:34.160]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:34.160 --> 59:40.160]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[59:40.160 --> 59:44.800]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to
[59:44.800 --> 59:51.640]  my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[59:51.640 --> 01:00:06.080]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:13.320]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:21.600]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:28.160]  well we've had former top Bush administration officials experts on
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.960]  Iran come out and say this whole plot is phony and manufactured we've had Bob
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:36.280]  Bear the former CIA black cop commander come out and say they're totally fake
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:42.200]  Ray McGovern former top CIA analyst to Reagan and of course Bush senior come
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:47.200]  out and say it's totally phony there are literally now hundreds I can't even
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:51.080]  keep track of top experts coming out and saying this is totally fake and phony
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:56.120]  we now have the affidavits they used to arrest this used car salesman drunk
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.320]  pothead he was just trying to do a drug deal with the very losses that is that
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.360]  the Justice Department allows the ship drugs in and ships guns into Mexico so
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:12.720]  a cover for fast and furious a pretext to launch war against Iran and the
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:18.120]  consensus of experts is Israel has green lighted an attack and is trying to
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:22.920]  get the US to do it congressman King labels Iran terror plot act of war says
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.520]  Obama should have troops on standby for a strike not even having Israel strike
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.360]  joining us for the next 30 minutes is Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer his
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:34.280]  bio was too long but he ran operations trying to kill bin Laden and was blocked
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:38.280]  he's best-selling author of Operation Darkheart and he dropped a bombshell two
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:43.920]  days ago and we wrote an article about it info wars.com on Andrew DePolitanos
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.480]  Fox business show we're going to break in a moment we'll get kicked off here now
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.920]  saying that he has an FBI Justice Department source that told him this
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:57.200]  whole plot was not in the computer system so this isn't just experts saying it
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:01.520]  looks phony it's fake it's a pretext for war a political smoke screen he says he
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.800]  talked to a Justice Department official who has the clearance and said it isn't
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:10.920]  in the system and it should be so so joining us is Anthony Schaefer Colonel
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:15.360]  good to have you with us thank you for having me back good to be on again so
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.880]  we're going to break here just a few minutes but let's go right to the heart
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:22.560]  of the matter after the break right now what are your sources saying is the
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:27.480]  attack on Iran right now green light well you know that's I gotta be honest
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.840]  with you I just met with him again and I went through everything one more time
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.840]  just to make sure it buys clear and look I'm doing the same thing there's just
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.760]  no information within their systems indicating the background this which is
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:43.240]  a huge red flag for a lot of guys in the inside secondly I gotta tell you even
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:47.000]  if there's a desire Alex there's there's really very little military
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.880]  capability one of the things that was revealed revealed to me is that yeah
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:54.480]  there's been a car that's got out for capability to do something but you know
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.800]  for better or for worse everything is really tied up in Afghanistan right now
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:02.000]  so you know there may be some elements here who were desiring the outcome what
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.960]  we move forward but I gotta be honest with you the former issue of what you
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:09.520]  said when in your introduction the issue regarding Southwest border nasaidas I
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:12.120]  really think is driving the trend at this point because I don't think there's
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:16.560]  any way we could credibly put together a military capability to do anything
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.600]  okay some stations don't carry this first five minutes so I want to come back
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:25.520]  Colonel and recap all of this but did I hear you correctly you talked to your
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.480]  Justice Department source and they said yeah it's not in the system and
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:33.920]  basically if this thing did exist and wasn't a fabrication it would be in the
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:38.320]  system or somebody doesn't want the investigation looked at and has expunged
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:44.440]  it either one of those are the options we're looking at absolutely the idea is
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:48.720]  this you know people who have the need to know don't have any information that
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:51.920]  they could look at and that's that's that's that's incredible especially at
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.760]  this point in time after this has been out in the news several days there's
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.920]  normally a great deal of information showing how the investigation came to
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:01.000]  the conclusions it did and they're telling me and I talked to another
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.680]  expert this morning regarding the actual indictment and the details of that
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:08.560]  this won't the actual indictment will not hold up in a court of law according
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:13.960]  to my expert so basically the two for here Alex first there's no credible
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.160]  information inside the system with poor people should be able to find it if they
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:20.280]  have a need to know and right to know the information and secondly the
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:23.360]  experts have looked at the actual indictment are telling me it this is
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:29.440]  this is not going to hold water when it comes to trial so that therefore you
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:32.880]  know and I'm please don't get me wrong I do believe the Iranians are a threat
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:35.640]  there's things that they have done and are doing that which are what we're
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:39.480]  starting to control I'm saying is right now this one instance does not look to

[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:16.520]  friends in the last 16 plus years I've been on air few things I've covered have
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:20.600]  been as important as we're covering right now and I got to be honest with you
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:26.040]  as bad as things are you don't know who's good and bad until you get to that
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:30.480]  crisis moment and I am heartened by the fact that I have literally without even
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:34.640]  trying seen more than 50 analysts and I know there's more than that top
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:41.160]  Clinton Bush administrations you name it come out Pentagon people colonel
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:46.000]  Schaefer FBI people giving him information Steve Pachinic
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:52.520]  Ray McGovern Bob Baer coming out saying this Iran situation is totally totally
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:56.120]  phony and these are people who fought Iran these are not people that are you
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:00.560]  know peacenicks or something the point is why has this been manufactured now
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:04.240]  now lieutenant colonel Anthony Schaefer best-selling author of the book they
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:08.720]  tried to redact operation dark heart the guy that had the top al-qaeda people in
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:12.600]  his size was barred from killing him pre-911 the guy that was persecuted for
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:17.960]  blowing the whistle but came out stronger on the other side for able
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:22.760]  danger you know a real Patriot colonel Schaefer joins us for the next next 20
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:26.760]  minutes and then we've got Gerald Solente joining us and also dr. Steve
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:30.960]  Pachinic who worked in a lot of different black op capacities including
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.560]  assassinations and overthrowing governments he called me ten times
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:38.760]  yesterday morning he never ring ring ring till I got off the treadmill went
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:43.160]  over and talked to him and he said look they're trying to green light a war you
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.880]  know he has all the Pentagon sources but I was just getting some good news from
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.200]  colonel Schaefer if you missed the last segment saying there are people that want
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.680]  to launch this war but the assets aren't there so I want to walk through this
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:59.040]  carefully but colonel Schaefer take your time because obviously that became a
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.160]  big national news story when you were on Judge Napolitano's Fox business and
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:07.040]  said your high-level Justice Department source with a high-level security
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:11.680]  clearance said it was not in the computers that sends up red flags
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:16.840]  specifically what do you mean by red flags what does this signify you said
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:21.480]  you met with the source again today or did you say yesterday to make sure you
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.320]  were right about this now that it's such a big story and then your incredible
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:31.160]  Pentagon connections you know is this green-lighted because I've had family
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:35.920]  officers who were just deployed there they are won't tell us what it is they
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:40.160]  say it's serious I have other sources that said well yeah you're right we are
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.440]  being told look to back up Israel in an Iran attack to get stuff out of the
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:48.680]  Strait of Hormuzh but I didn't tell you that but but I know you were high level
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:52.240]  in the think tanks and the Pentagon connections and you know lectured on
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:56.000]  actual strategy level and so your your security clearance has been as high as
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.800]  it gets so you've got sources I don't have so let's walk through here for
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:04.320]  people the magnitude of this because a lot of my sources say this is the
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:09.200]  closest we've gotten to an actual attack on Iran and you've got Congressman
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:13.360]  King saying we this is an act of war Obama's got to get the military going
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:17.200]  certainly this is the biggest drum beating I've seen and why would they
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:21.880]  use such a faulty piece of garbage to sell this you've got the floor colonel
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:26.880]  break it down well thank you well first off you know I think it is very clear
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:32.320]  that the thing that we must do and it's not talk to a lot of folks who are of
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:36.560]  my mind you know the we the last thing we want to do Alex is make an enemy of
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:41.160]  the Iranian people the Iranian people are Persians and frankly they are set up
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.840]  with their the bureaucracy which rules them as we are the thing is though we
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:47.840]  did we cannot afford to make them an adversary in the process of moving
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:51.120]  forward that's why I think the military debate is so important at this point
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:55.200]  because some people recognize you want to have all the different components
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.040]  available to you to do things at the same time the last thing you want to do
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:03.240]  is actually do something which will enable the theocracy to actually clap
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.800]  down even more on the people that's that's the issue right now that I'm
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:10.440]  being told is really kind of the the the thing is pushing people back now
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:14.000]  regarding the history you you let me be very clear for your audience they
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.680]  understand look come when I was in Afghanistan and this is my book Dark
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:23.640]  Heart we found the Iranians were up to no good as early as 03 there's two
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.840]  chapters devoted to an interrogation of a of a US citizen who was a Iranian
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.840]  descent his brother was working for the IRGC and his brother was there in
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:37.440]  eastern Afghanistan on the opposite side of the country from Iran paying people
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:42.040]  to stir up trouble against us so let me be very clear I'm not pro-Iranian by
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:46.400]  any circumstance of the imagination I have seen what these people what the
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:50.800]  Iranian IRGC has been doing to try to kill our soldiers so there's no way in
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.600]  heck that I would ever come out for the Iranians with that said I think we have
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:00.600]  to we have to understand that we're playing a chess game and simply you
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:07.560]  know pushing our military towards a a a a kinetic solution is not the best
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:13.480]  solution here and what what concerns me is that this as you mentioned in the
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:18.360]  introduction this this operation just smells this assassination concept
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.440]  smells of a plot and let me tell you something this is an exclusive for you
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:25.720]  guys and I gotta tell you I was at my publisher yesterday in New York City and
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:30.840]  I actually asked them did you guys leak this the the outline of my next book
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:35.480]  because frankly a lot of the stuff that's in this current plot is actually in a
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:39.000]  plot line we're working on in my next book so I was I gotta be honest with you
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.920]  Alex I was flabbergasted when I saw this you know materialized in the press
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:48.880]  because much of this is not only like a Hollywood script I frankly you know we
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:52.680]  were looking at doing something in fiction which mimics very closely what's
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.760]  going on in this so-called plot so that's what made me just set up and say
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:00.840]  wow there's something really wacky about this and that that Colonel Schaefer
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:06.400]  for those that don't know a lot of times different agencies do even different
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:11.640]  governments will use plot lines to actually carry out real attacks or fake
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:16.720]  attacks they will also as is has been admitted for 12 years that I know of the
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:21.640]  Pentagon the CIA actually pay script writers to write scripts for them quote
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:26.960]  to be able to imagine what terrorists might do so the fact that you went to
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:30.440]  your publisher when you were in New York to be on MSNBC yesterday because I know
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:34.000]  you were there you couldn't come on here yesterday and that you're saying maybe
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.760]  somebody leaked your script and then maybe the White House used it is that
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:41.560]  what you're getting at? Well it may be because I mean there's so many parallels
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:46.520]  to this thing and I mean frankly what we're looking at here is a plot where 24
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:50.480]  meets the Sopranos which makes me you know obviously it's great for fiction but
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:55.040]  I think the the reality of which we're faced with is is entirely different I
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.720]  mean and let me tell you as an intelligence professional this used car
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:03.800]  salesman would be the last individual in the world that I as a professional
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:08.160]  intelligence officer would would direct to get in contact with a drug group to
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:12.040]  become a group of assassins it let me tell you on the face of that you know
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:17.200]  that is beyond any operational knowledge that any intelligence officer would do
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:22.120]  you just don't trust someone with that lack of a focus and training to do
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:26.240]  something that would be that key and critical to an assassination plot it's
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:30.720]  just not done so when you normally go after well-performing former military
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.280]  people or doctors or engineers or people that have shown that they're focused in
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:39.600]  professional there's a term and you've used before called vetting one of the
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:43.280]  things one of the key elements of any successful intelligence operation you
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:46.400]  can ask Bob Barrett this Bob would probably tell you the same thing the key
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:50.160]  to a successful intelligence operation is vetting of an asset to make sure that
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:53.920]  you test them adequately to understand to make sure that they will do your
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:59.480]  bidding when the time comes and and frankly that this guy was from well as
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:03.680]  far as I could tell I wouldn't have used him to do it basically a dead drop for
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:07.480]  me because I think he's not even that reliable and the second thing that you
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:10.400]  need to look at I hope your audience looks at very hard is the wire
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:14.200]  transfers my goodness you know since the beginning of the current war
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.280]  where everybody's been looking at at high-dollar transfers of money so again
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:22.960]  an intelligence organization with the professional background of the IRGC or
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:28.440]  the Coots force you know I think they watch us very closely so for them to
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:32.680]  make an amateur mistake tell me one of two things first there was a radical
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:36.520]  element within the Coots force who was just doing this on their own and really
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:39.400]  really kind of did one of this credit the other side and don't let's not forget
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:43.640]  that within the Iranian government there is a huge conflict going on between
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:48.720]  Ahmadinejad and and the other folks who want to do different things so
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:52.720]  there there is truly a conflict there so this could well be good news by the
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.640]  fact that there's a visible break within the government and
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:01.640]  someone there did this trying to prove a point but on the other hand this could
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:06.880]  be again a provocation by someone here who basically wanted this to be caught
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.320]  and again I've talked to a number of intelligent professionals many of which
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:14.760]  Alex are and again like you've already said these guys are these guys and
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:19.520]  gals are not pro-Iranian but they've told me based on their experience because
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:23.280]  I wanted to make sure I wasn't crazy that that they based on their
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:30.560]  experience this basic format does not add up to any any known format for a
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:34.160]  successful intelligence operation if you're really it is but it does fit the
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:38.840]  format that we've seen hundreds of times the last few years of the FBI setting
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:42.680]  up mentally ill patsies or just purely setting people up and as you mentioned
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:46.560]  the affidavit it's in the news today with those that have seen the affidavit
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:50.600]  that it was the informant running the whole thing and this was just some
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:55.280]  idiot trying to be part of a drug deal and make some money and that it isn't
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:59.520]  even designed to hold up later it's just a pretext to launch a war so I want to
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:02.600]  Colonel Schaefer I want to go back here specifically because this is what
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:06.320]  everybody really wants to understand tell us as much as you can about your
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:10.400]  high-level FBI Justice Department source with the security clearance you said
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:14.080]  you've met with them again just to make sure what they told you was correct you
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:18.880]  said in the last segment that yes and more what are they telling you about
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:23.880]  this not being in their files not being in their computer system well there's
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:28.480]  there's three things that are notable first obviously if you're on the inside
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:30.680]  this is kind of common sense the first thing you're going to do if you're a
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.280]  security expert with an interest or responsibility in terrorism you're going
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:38.360]  to look at this to see if it means something to you directly so a lot of
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:41.000]  these guys will sit down and go through because they had the clearance to start
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  doing research within the classified room and find out what's going on well
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.360]  the first point Alex was one one one these friends of mine decided to go
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:52.000]  check it out is like there's nothing there and that's highly suspect because
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.440]  normally the government especially inside wants to brag about what it's done
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:59.760]  well and oh by the way if there's a threat this derivative of this that you
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:03.680]  need to be concerned about they put it out there so again in this case there's
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.960]  nothing really out there from what they're telling me now again I don't
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:08.880]  have direct access I'm going with what they've told me so that by the way this
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:13.040]  thing goes back months and months and months so it's also an older case right
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.800]  and let's remember that all this really started transpiring in September but
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:19.760]  really wasn't revealed until you know a couple days ago so that's the first
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.800]  indication of something is not quite right secondly relating to the the fact
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:30.000]  that this is a southwest border thing they feel that this may be distracting
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.600]  directly from other things going on now their view of it is is that the Zed
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:39.000]  this is actually something trying to draw attention to the Zed is because
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.360]  there's a competing drug group in the southwest border that the Mexican
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:46.280]  government is now going after and and basically they're telling me that that
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:49.920]  they believe that the Zed is we're we're pointed out specifically in this
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:54.760]  because there is a desire to kind of prop them up and draw more attention to
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:58.920]  them so they they believe my inside guys think that this may be a plot to try to
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:02.880]  draw attention to the to the to this one drug group over one of the competing
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:06.080]  drug groups and I I have to get more details next I'm not an expert in that
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:10.040]  area let me give you details are the reason I'm a quote expert as we've been
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:14.240]  following and I'm down here in Texas and Celica still was a DEA agent they set up
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:18.880]  for guns and actually put in jail over this six years ago he told me all this
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:23.360]  was starting up with competing drug cartels some backed by the US government
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:27.560]  others by other factions and since then it's come out El Paso time Chicago
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:32.400]  Tribune in these court cases Sinaloa is allowed to ship in unlimited cocaine this
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:36.200]  is confirmed that the the feds have now declared national security in Chicago
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:40.760]  and have said basically it's true and then they're given the thousands of guns
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:45.280]  that are directly given to them by ATF and then this is confirmed going back
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:49.400]  at least since Obama got in but some of it goes back further and so what you
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:54.040]  just said there with Zed is and Sinaloa there's a lot of heat on Sinaloa right
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:21:00.240]  now and there has been this move to try to focus it over onto Zed is but also
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:05.680]  notice it it lets the Attorney General talk about fighting Mexican cartels and
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:09.240]  just muddies the water with people that are barely paying attention oh that's
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:13.760]  the Attorney General fighting the Mexican cartels with the Iranians you know
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:17.800]  who are involved instead of what is the Justice Department doing shipping guns
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:23.160]  to Sinaloa right and that that is exactly the point they brought up to me
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:27.120]  saying that they think that that's the real issue behind what's going on and
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:30.360]  the third point goes back to the extension of the part we just talked
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:34.880]  about we need to be looking at what's going on in that area because frankly you
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:38.720]  know if the Iranians even if this was a real plot the fact that they would try
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:41.640]  to direct someone to the Southwest border should indicate that there may be a
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:45.280]  weakness or that we need to look at so so basically the three points are you
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:49.840]  know first off it's just not sufficient information in the classified system
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:55.480]  that would go with a high profile case of this nature both from the derivative
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:59.680]  hey look out for this because something may happen on your watch and by the fact
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.200]  that there's no information available kind of the filling in the rest of
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:06.280]  details for those who have the clearance secondly they believe this links
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:09.960]  directly to the Zeta issue trying to draw more attention to the Zed is over
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:14.560]  this competing group and third they believe that the fact that this is all
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:19.880]  transpiring on the border should give everybody pause and and really make
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:23.360]  everybody look down there and one of the things that they didn't tell me this
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:27.360]  but there's a saying that that I've always lived by what one time senator
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:32.200]  Trent Lott told me in the Fox Green Room he said Tony no matter what they're
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:36.480]  talking about publicly the real issue is something else so so frankly Alex I
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:39.520]  think what we need to be looking at is what is the other issue here is it a
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:44.240]  pretext for war or is it a you know a kind of the bait and switch getting us
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:47.160]  to look at a different direction regarding the Southwest border issue but
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:51.240]  anyway you look at it any way you cut it the real issue is somewhere else out
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:54.360]  there and this is why I encourage you and your listeners to actually encourage
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:59.560]  you know the government owes us more explanation on what's actually going on
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:05.440]  because at this point in time nothing seems to add up well you're right and
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:08.720]  and you just raised a point that I thought about privately but hadn't
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:12.240]  raised and it may have gone over some people's heads who were just driving
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:17.640]  down the road not really listening clearly or closely but a lot of times
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:21.400]  when the establishment knows there's about to be an attack and they want it
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:24.480]  to happen for political purposes or they don't think they can stop it whatever
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:29.720]  the case is they will focus attention on to a Patsy and a region so that when
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:35.000]  the attack comes they say see we tried to stop it and I think that's what you
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:40.200]  were basically starting to allude to well absolutely this is again a concern
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:43.640]  from the guy the folks in the inside it's like if that if they are saying this
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:48.080]  if there's and this looks so hokey there may be a reason why they're getting
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:52.360]  people distracted to do something here so now now they don't know of any other
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:56.160]  attacks or obviously anything else we're just focusing on a specific issue but
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:00.560]  yeah Alex that the problem is this there's so many holes in the current
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:05.880]  story everybody is is so distracted on trying to figure out what is really
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:09.880]  going on there may be other things that aren't being looked at which we should
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:14.360]  look at this is this is a this is again this is a pattern this is where we've
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:17.920]  done things like this before and it's very important for your listeners to
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:22.960]  understand that they need to demand accountability and frankly I'd like to
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:26.000]  believe the intelligence officers you've talked to that I you know and we one of
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.600]  the reasons I'm speaking out is it that our government owes us a fair and true
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:35.280]  accounting of what they're doing to defend us and more importantly the the
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:40.600]  evidence they bring forward should be ironclad to the truth not some fiction
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:44.040]  they draw up or put together based on the fact that they've taken people of
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:48.720]  diminished capacity and tried to prop them up as it's as a threat and then
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:52.320]  Colonel that's my next point for you because and and this is the heart of
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:57.640]  it then look and I know you like to give people general information but just
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:01.320]  boiling it down here you've got the subpoena that they knew was going to
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:05.560]  come out the next day and so the day before the subpoenas on lying about
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:09.560]  fast and furious which in the court documents is cocaine allowed to be
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:16.280]  brought in justice department involved eight federal agencies not just ATF but
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:24.480]  DEA FBI border patrol Coast Guard I mean this is incredible and then shipping
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:28.720]  guns which is now confirmed not just letting guns be sold the ATF shipping
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:32.760]  them to Sinaloa I mean this could have brought them down so right as these
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:38.760]  right as these subpoenas go out this whole smoke screen comes out I mean is
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:42.120]  that what you're getting at yes it is I think that's what we need to be
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:45.520]  concerned about the timing of this and again let's just look at this in the
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.680]  common sense perspective let we know we're none of us have any background
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:53.520]  why on earth if this was that key an issue would you wait almost two weeks
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:56.440]  before talking about it the American people if this is really that credible
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:02.120]  threat and you've got you've got the guy secondly the timing could you know I
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:07.320]  don't believe after being in this town for the past 25 years I don't believe
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:11.320]  in coincidence I don't believe that somehow out of the goodness of the DOJ's
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:15.600]  heart that that Eric Holder then said we need to get the word out because it's
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:19.120]  the right thing to do I do believe that the information coming out the day
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:23.360]  before the the additional subpoenas were coming over from from from Conksman
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:27.640]  Isis staff wasn't an indicator that they don't want to have people talking
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:32.600]  about this and frankly this was such a provocative concept and let's then again
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:36.640]  let's look at the Hollywood value of this Alex it was meant to be sexy it was
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.480]  meant to get people to buy into it yes you know you're talking about all the
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:45.720]  sex you're talking about multiple countries international intrigue
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:50.720]  characters that they came out of the you know out of out of out of the central
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:54.720]  casting all coming together for something that was it was like throwing
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:57.920]  red red meat to lions and I think that's what they were hoping for here and
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:02.360]  I and I and I think they they overplayed their hand which is probably good for all
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:07.080]  of us all right Colonel the book is Operation Dark Heart best-selling
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:10.480]  available on Amazon everywhere else we really appreciate your time in the two
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:16.120]  minutes we've got left this is very encouraging unless I heard you wrong
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:20.560]  earlier you're saying from your Pentagon sources they're saying we just don't
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:25.600]  have the capability right now to back up Israel in an attack but Israel sounds
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:30.080]  like they are going in we saw Panetta 11 days ago say Israel's more isolated
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:36.000]  than ever what is the in two minutes the analysis from your perspective on where
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.640]  we're going with Iran where Israel's going first off the Iranians do pose a
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:47.440]  threat they have a theocracy which hates us and everything we're doing and they
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:51.880]  are developing nuclear weapons look I spent a week last week working with
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:55.000]  National Defense University on an exercise regarding electromagnetic pulse
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.120]  weapons which we believe the Iranians are developing which could do huge damage
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:01.600]  to us but I don't believe they would draw attention to themselves at a time of
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:04.160]  trying to develop a secret weapon I just don't think that's in the cards and
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:07.840]  frankly this administration has been more forgiving to them than any other so I
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:10.800]  don't think they'd want to prompt anything going against that with that
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:15.280]  said I think we are overstretched people are telling me that while there may be
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:19.560]  desire there's no capability to go in and do the level of strikes necessary to
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:23.680]  take these things out and lastly we've got to figure out a way to help promote
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:29.320]  the citizens of Iran and their desire to be free without jeopardizing our own
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:33.200]  security so that's the type why are we after that they're saying the words
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:37.960]  from all your inside sources is that they're not gonna go into Iran what's
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:42.960]  the word on it on Israel then that I'm trying to find out I gotta be honest
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:46.680]  I have no information on that right now all I know for sure right now is that
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:51.120]  there was a car for capability and the basically the answer came back everything
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:55.160]  from Iraq has either been re put into Afghanistan or it's basically so broken
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:59.160]  you can't use it so that that is the way I'm hearing what about true builds up
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:04.080]  but what about true build-ups in Kuwait and other areas Alex the troops are
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:06.800]  always gonna be there in some form I the question is because obviously becomes
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:10.320]  do they do a surgery or not and frankly I think that a surgery be picked up
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:13.760]  I'm pretty quick if they started doing that at this point I have no indication
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:18.280]  from my guys that they're gonna be able to do that so okay well that's
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:23.840]  certainly good news then I mean from your camp and from your sources that
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:27.440]  there have been calls for this we know King's calling for it he wants troops
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:31.040]  standing by the congressman but you're saying that that isn't the direction
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:36.720]  that's that this is going in right now not right now it could change all right
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:39.400]  Colonel Anthony Schaefer thank you for spending time with us amazing
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:45.680]  information all right ladies and gentlemen we'll be right back with Gerald
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:49.520]  Salente and we've got a big report that's up on the drugs report right now
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:58.760]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:05.640]  a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:09.720]  important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:13.600]  everything about our lives the way you shop travel invest educate your
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:16.880]  children and even how you take care of your health and your own family now

[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:55.840]  Central Standard Time We Are Here
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:00.840]  And I am on the road today joining you from right by the border down here investigating
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:05.840]  The national news stories that we're all covering here today
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:11.840]  The TSA is announcing in Boston where they made a test that they'll now ask you where you're going, what you're doing
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:14.840]  And if you're a terrorist all part of training you that you're the bad guy
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:19.840]  How about asking them, hey you're caught stealing all the time, you're caught being pedophiles every day
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:23.840]  You're radiating yourselves to death, you're the walking dead
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:26.840]  How about we treat them like they're guilty until proven innocent
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:30.840]  Oh but they're the government, we can trust them
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:33.840]  You go to DrudgeReport.com today
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:36.840]  If you look on the right hand side third link down and you click on that link
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:43.840]  It says House Bill would criminalize satire of the Transportation Security Administration
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:46.840]  The federal out of control power grabbers
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:48.840]  On September 22, 2011
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:53.840]  When Kurt wrote this article this morning I went and checked, we did break this
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:55.840]  This has been out for weeks and nobody even knew
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:58.840]  HR 3011 was introduced
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:05.840]  And you can go read it, it's entitled the Transportation Security Administration Authorization Act of 2011
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:08.840]  It's got all sorts of power grabbing language
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:17.840]  But it says you will get felony time if you make fun of them in any way or even write the words TSA
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:22.840]  Or any likeness thereof, you don't talk about them, they're like God behind the holy veil
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:27.840]  You don't even go in there unless you're a high priest groper of the TSA
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:31.840]  So go read that article, just absolutely incredible
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:37.840]  It says any imitation of TSA, FAMS, FAM
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:42.840]  Words or initials or likenesses of a Transportation Security Administration
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:49.840]  Or federal air marshal service logo or insignia or any item of apparel in connection with any advertisement, circular
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:56.840]  Book pamphlet, software, other publication or with any play, motion picture, broadcast, telecast or other production
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:00.840]  You don't show it in a movie, of course it will all be selectively enforced
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:05.840]  You don't show a photo of a TSA person in your book, they are now God
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:09.840]  They better be God because I call them the walking dead
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:14.840]  This is the term I used to take for them in Boston where they tested the body standards eight years ago
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:18.840]  And they have three to eight times the different types of cancer increases
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:26.840]  I called it TSA Suicide Squad because they're all just roasting, it's been admitted in the high radiation
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:30.840]  And if you're smart and get out, they don't care, they just get people that are so dumb
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:34.840]  They'll die for the power to rob your bags and grope your children
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:37.840]  I saw an article this morning about another one busted for child porn
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:44.840]  It was one, two days ago, I mean, who do you think wants to grab and get in the diapers of babies?
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:51.840]  Now, we're about to go to Gerald Salenta here, but I go back to this
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:56.840]  A lot of them are just mainly veterans who want a decent paying job, twenty bucks an hour
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:00.840]  A lot of them are post office people that got laid off because the post office is shrinking
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:05.840]  They're either control freak thugs or they're just people that want a job
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:08.840]  Because everywhere I fly, they go, Alex, we know we want to get unionized
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:10.840]  We don't want to be doing this, but it's a job
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:13.840]  Here, let me have your signature and they shake my hand and stuff
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:18.840]  So, again, it's this compartmentalization, but it's out of control
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:23.840]  Now, Gerald Salenta joins us for the next 45 minutes, and I'm very honored to have him
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:28.840]  He had this big issue that came out at the start of the year titled The Next Great War
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:31.840]  21st Century, The Next Great War
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:35.840]  I forget the exact headline, it was a newspaper style headline, we could pull it up and put it on screen
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:40.840]  Or the man himself can give me the exact headline, I'm on the roads, I don't have it in front of me
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:44.840]  And for a lot of us who research history, we're like, yeah, that's a no-brainer
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:48.840]  Well, no, it's not for the general public, but Gerald specifically called it
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:51.840]  And said they're going to try to start a wider war
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:38:00.840]  And they're trying now, the difference is this plot has got people left, right, center, you name it
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:05.840]  Intelligence, agency, people, retired, high level, experts
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:09.840]  I already listed it earlier, coming out and saying this is manufactured, this is a fraud
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:15.840]  The affidavits have now been seen, total set up, it is just crazy what's happening
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:18.840]  Now they're calling it the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:24.840]  Now they're admitting we never left the recession when they called Gerald Salenta a pessimist, porn dealer
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:27.840]  When they called me a lying kook
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:31.840]  The truth is the system knows what it's doing, but it's busy robbing everyone
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:34.840]  Gerald talked about the Euro falling apart three years ago
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:41.840]  Now it's doing it, but the white shoe boys, as he calls them, want to get more power out of the crisis that they have created
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:46.840]  So Gerald, there's a lot going on in the world I wanted to get you back on, because so much has happened
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:52.840]  And the establishment lackeys are trying to launch this new war
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:58.840]  What do you make of this, and what do your other analysts there at the Trends Research Institute make of this, Gerald?
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:03.840]  Well, it's exactly what you said, this latest Iranian fabrication
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:09.840]  And how they keep teaching us to hate the Iranians, what have they done to us recently, you know
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:14.840]  Other than us trying to steal their oil going back until the early 1950s
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:22.840]  When we, along with the CIA and the MI5 over there in the UK
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:27.840]  Over through the democratically elected government of Mosaddeg in 1953
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:33.840]  Because standard oil and British petroleum, of course they were Anglo-English
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:40.840]  Anglo-Inglish, I believe, Anglo-Iranian in those days, who were controlling the oil fields
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:44.840]  But really, I mean, Iranians didn't invade Afghanistan
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:50.840]  I don't believe the Iranians invaded Iraq either, didn't the United States start a war against Iraq and Iran?
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:53.840]  Oh, and the Iranians, they didn't invade Libya, did they?
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:59.840]  So these terrible Iranians, so now we're getting, they're prepping us to hate the Iranians again
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:03.840]  And when all else fails, they take us to war
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:08.840]  This is what we wrote in 2008 when the TARP program began
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:11.840]  We said they were building the bailout bubble
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:15.840]  And when all else fails, you can see it happening
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:23.840]  The crash of 29, the Great Depression, currency wars, trade wars, world wars
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:29.840]  The panic of 08, the Great Depression that we're in, the currency wars
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:34.840]  The Senate just passed a currency bill against China
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:39.840]  China has responded that trade wars are beginning
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:47.840]  The financial cabinet minister of Brazil, Montague, currency wars are underway
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:55.840]  Panic, depression, currency wars, trade wars, real wars
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:41:02.840]  The world is at war, only an idiot or somebody totally out of touch can't add it up
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:04.840]  Let's go around the globe
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:18.840]  Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, now Saudi Arabia, Libya, Syria, Bahrain, Morocco, Algeria, Nigeria, Somalia, Ivory Coast
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:24.840]  Go over to the UK, riots in the streets this last summer
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:28.840]  Over in Spain, take a trip over to Greece
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:34.840]  Hey, now right here in the USA, this whole Occupy movement
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:38.840]  It's in Denver, it's in Portland, it's in Seattle, it's in San Diego
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:46.840]  It's in Los Angeles, it's in Auburn, it's in Trenton, it's in Atlanta
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:53.840]  It's everywhere, Birmingham, Phoenix, San Diego, Sacramento
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:42:00.840]  It's spreading, the first great war of the 21st century has begun
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:05.840]  And Gerald, when people lose everything, they lose it
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:11.840]  We've just been covering common sense history, you've been boiling it down in a very concise way
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:16.840]  But then you and I still, and others, get demonized by the establishment
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:20.840]  They think they have more credibility because they're always proven wrong
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:25.840]  But as you've said, they're not really wrong, they're lying to people
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:30.840]  And so we see the mainstream media actually hemorrhaging viewers and support
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:35.840]  Where do you see that going? I mean, how long can the, you know,
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:41.840]  limp-wristed establishment or media pacify people when everything they say is a
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.840]  basically a twisted lie?
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:47.840]  I mean, how long could the prostitutes keep playing prostitutes?
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:51.840]  So how long does a prostitute become a prostitute?
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:55.840]  They died as prostitutes, they live and die by it
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:00.840]  These people have no backbones, with the exception of a very few
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:06.840]  They keep sucking up and bowing down and serving their masters for their pay
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:11.840]  So you're not going to, by the way, nothing is going to change with the systems that are in place
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:15.840]  So when you look at all these protests, by the way
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:20.840]  I mentioned Tunisia, I mentioned Egypt, here's the new boss, same as the old boss
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:25.840]  All the rioting going on over there in Greece every week
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:30.840]  Massive riots, demonstrations, nothing changes, the systems have to change
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:36.840]  So now this is really, I have to tell you, you know, I gave up on the American people
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:41.840]  I thought that they were a bunch of mommies, boys and spoiled girls
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:45.840]  That wouldn't be fighting, this movement has really legs to it
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:48.840]  It may not, you know, this might not be it
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:52.840]  But when you put the tea party together, you put this together
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:56.840]  You look at all the social unrest around the world
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:59.840]  No, what they're going to do, what the media is going to do
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:03.840]  Is they're going to prop up the war machine
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:06.840]  Just like the toilet paper a record does
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:09.840]  Look how they got us into this Libyan war
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:14.840]  You remember, Alex, the one that was going to end in days, not weeks
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:18.840]  You know, that, what was it, time-limited, scope-limited, kinetic action
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:21.840]  That's been going on now for eight months
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:25.840]  And now it's a minor footnote that, oh, Gaddafi's still fighting on
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:29.840]  Pentagon surprised, I saw that on Monday, Gerald
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:33.840]  And let me ask you this question, and then I want to get into future trends with you
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:37.840]  Gerald, what do you make, though, of all the teleprompter readers
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:43.840]  I've been watching at CNN, Fox, MSNBC, CNBC, Bloomberg
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:47.840]  The talking heads are, yes, Iran's got the nukes, we've got to get them
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:53.840]  They launched this attack, but it doesn't matter if it's Clinton, Bush
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:57.840]  Bob Baer, Anthony Shaffer, Colonel
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:00.840]  I mean, the list goes, I mean, it's literally 50, 60, 70, I've seen it
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:04.840]  I can't keep track of it, they're all coming out saying it's phony, it's bull
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:07.840]  It's a distraction for fast and furious
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:11.840]  That's one of the first times I've seen where the teleprompter readers don't know what to do
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:15.840]  When every analyst they've got on is saying this is baloney
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:19.840]  And actually thinking about government staging a crisis for political control
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:24.840]  So that shows that reality is really starting to seep in on the prostitutes
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:27.840]  Oh, yeah, it's seeping in all right
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:31.840]  And, you know, there's a lot of people in the military that don't want another war
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:34.840]  I mean, Gates didn't want the Libyan war
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:37.840]  You go back and read the lines that were coming out of the Pentagon
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:39.840]  They were against this thing
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:43.840]  The three witches of Macbeth, you know, that are alive today
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:47.840]  Hillary Clinton, that rice over there
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:50.840]  Samantha Rice over at the UN, or whatever her name is
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:54.840]  Something rice and powers and national security
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:57.840]  These three women are the ones that pushed it on us
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:45:59.840]  And it's still going on
[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:03.840]  This one that was going to be a humanitarian mission to save the people
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:06.840]  Have you looked at the photos of these bombed-out cities
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:11.840]  And not one of the prostitutes are reporting the amount of dead Libyans
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:12.840]  Well, they're also one
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:17.840]  And they come out with the arrogance that, hey, you know, there are Iranians over there
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:19.840]  They were trying to kill a Saudi
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:21.840]  They better stop this, yeah
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:25.840]  While the United States is bombing Libya, bombing Afghanistan
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:28.840]  We have troops in Iraq, predator drones flying into Yemen
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:31.840]  Killing our own citizens without a trial
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:35.840]  How about a couple of predator drones flying into Pakistan
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:38.840]  Hey, watch out for them Iranians
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:42.840]  Even though it's coming out as another big lie
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:44.840]  You know, from the Gulf of Tonkin
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:47.840]  That never happened, that killed 60,000 of our troops
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:50.840]  Wounded over 300,000 for the Vietnam War
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:52.840]  Killed millions over there
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:55.840]  Even though the big lies of
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:59.840]  They don't have weapons of mass destruction in Taish al-Qaeda and Iraq
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:02.840]  What this Iranian thing does, you see, Alex
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:04.840]  For the people that don't know
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:06.840]  They pick up the soundbite
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:08.840]  And now they hate the Iranians
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:11.840]  So now what they'll do, even if they lose on this one
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:14.840]  It's another one under their arm
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:16.840]  Another piece in the book
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:19.840]  So when another false flag comes
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:21.840]  And they throw another war on us
[01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:25.840]  They'll add up enough to get a lot of the sheeple to follow
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:27.840]  Well, that was my next point
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:29.840]  They're already saying
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:31.840]  No, you're right, they're already saying
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:32.840]  Well, you don't buy this
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:36.840]  We've got more fake Iranian stories about to come out
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:37.840]  Exactly
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:41.840]  When all else loses, they take you to war
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:45.840]  These are sociopaths and psychopaths
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:48.840]  You could call them presidents or prime ministers
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:51.840]  You could clean it up any way you want
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:54.840]  You have to call a spade a spade
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:57.840]  These people are sick
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:59.840]  They're mass murderers
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.840]  Can anybody say that line?
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:03.840]  They're mass murderers
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:07.840]  They're killing innocent people for fake reasons
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:09.840]  Well, you're saying it, and it's true
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:11.840]  I mean, take this fast and furious
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:13.840]  The court documents are all there
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:16.840]  It's in the El Paso Times, Chicago Tribune
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:19.840]  Four or five other big papers have been doing series on it
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:25.840]  But it's not just ATF ordering gun shops to sell guns to illegals and drug dealers
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:26.840]  That's a cover story
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:29.840]  The ATF in one shipment alone
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:31.840]  It's now in the court record admitted
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:34.840]  Shipped 2,000 guns to send a Loa drug cartel
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:37.840]  And allowed them to ship tons of cocaine in
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:39.840]  To launder it through U.S. banks
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:42.840]  They're caught red-handed, Gerald
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:45.840]  Just like Bank of America caught stealing houses they don't own
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:49.840]  I mean, when you say they're criminals, they really are
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:52.840]  I mean, it's one thing to have boss-hog corrupt government
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:53.840]  We've had that before
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:54.840]  But now it's not enough
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:56.840]  Now the criminals want to stick their hands down their pants
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:59.840]  Now the criminals want to set up checkpoints on the highway
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:03.840]  Now the criminals, I mean, they've got checkpoints now 100 miles into Texas
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:05.840]  Where they just let the illegals drive through
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:08.840]  But pull citizens out of their cars, put dogs in them
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:10.840]  They ask me, they say, I want to search your car
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:12.840]  And I say, the government deals drugs
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:15.840]  The Border Patrol is in the government documents
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:17.840]  Letting through certain shipments
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:19.840]  I don't deal drugs like you
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:21.840]  I mean, how obvious does it have to get
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:23.840]  And where is it going with these crooks?
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:25.840]  Because Gerald, they know we're waking up to them
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:27.840]  And so they're just trying to waddle in now
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:28.840]  And say, we're taking your rides
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:31.840]  Because look, hand puppet, scary Iranian
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:32.840]  He's going to get you
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:35.840]  And they're doing it worldwide, by the way
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:37.840]  They're doing it in Italy, they're doing it in Spain
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:39.840]  They're doing it in the U.K.
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:42.840]  They're cracking down more and more on the people
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:44.840]  As they keep losing control
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:46.840]  And that's what's really happening
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:49.840]  So as you see the whole
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:51.840]  What this is really about
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:54.840]  Is that the bottom line has collapsed
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:58.840]  The world is in the Great Depression
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:00.840]  There's no way out
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:02.840]  They're blaming others
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:04.840]  Look what's going on over here
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:06.840]  We heard Timothy Geithner
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:10.840]  Going over to the European Union meeting over there
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:12.840]  And telling them to get their act together
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:14.840]  And straighten this mess out
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:16.840]  Oh, yeah, like they could fix it
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:18.840]  Sarkozy and Merkel are getting together
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:20.840]  Putting their heads together
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:24.840]  Laurel and Hardy are going to fix the pulp
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:26.840]  All they know how to do is steal
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:30.840]  Exactly, so then they're blaming the Europeans
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:33.840]  They're blaming the Chinese now
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:35.840]  What I'm trying to say out
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:37.840]  What I am saying, Alex
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:40.840]  Is they're diverting the attention away
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:42.840]  From the big issue
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:44.840]  And the big issue is this
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:46.840]  You talked about all the criminals
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:48.840]  You talked about them in the TSA
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:51.840]  You talked about them with the FBI
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:54.840]  You talked about them with Homeland Security
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:56.840]  You talked about them with the government
[01:50:56.840 --> 01:50:58.840]  Stay there with a big point
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:50:59.840]  Stay there, stay there
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:01.840]  We gotta go to break, sorry Gerald
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:03.840]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:05.840]  You wake up to urinate, now be honest

[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:02.840]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones
[01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:05.840]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:08.840]  Want to relay to you and your families
[01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:10.840]  That we are intensifying our efforts
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:12.840]  Against the globalist on every front
[01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:15.840]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:17.840]  Against the technocrats
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:20.840]  But we can't do that without your help
[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:22.840]  By getting the films, bumper stickers
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:24.840]  And t-shirts at InfoWars.com

[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:29.840]  And support our operation

[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:33.840]  We need your help to spread the word
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:34.840]  Like never before
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:36.840]  They wish to hide themselves
[01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:38.840]  During this tectonic battle
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:40.840]  Between the forces of freedom and darkness
[01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:42.840]  You are the response
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:44.840]  To the globalist technocrats
[01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:48.840]  And their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:50.840]  And ultimate extermination
[01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:52.840]  The war is here
[01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:54.840]  It's an Info War
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:56.840]  The spirit of 1776
[01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:59.840]  Versus the mindset of 1984
[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:02.840]  What you're about to hear is the real experience
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:04.840]  Of women over 40 who finally lost weight
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:06.840]  Even around the stubborn belly area
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:07.840]  How?
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:09.840]  By becoming hormonally balanced again
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:12.840]  Their secret is the Amber and Slim After 40 program
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:14.840]  Amber and is the revolutionary formula
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:17.840]  For women over 40 that balances hormones naturally
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:19.840]  You see, the leading cause of weight gain
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:21.840]  Over 40 is hormonal imbalance
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:22.840]  Unless you balance your hormones
[01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:24.840]  Losing weight may be impossible
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:26.840]  But the Amber and Slim After 40 program
[01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:28.840]  Changes all of that
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:30.840]  Amber and restores hormonal balance naturally
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:33.840]  Plus it dramatically boosts your cell metabolism
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:35.840]  So the weight can just fall right off
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:37.840]  Even that stubborn belly fat
[01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:40.840]  Plus Amber and eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:42.840]  Like hot flashes, night sweats, low libido
[01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:44.840]  Difficulty concentrating and more
[01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:46.840]  Be one of the first 50 callers right now

[01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:56.840]  That's 1-800-894-8776
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:59.840]  1-800-894-8776
[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:08.840]  Alright, we are back live
[01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:11.840]  Gerald Salente got interrupted by the break
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:13.840]  He was making the point that
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:15.840]  We talk about the criminality
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:17.840]  By any yardstick in history
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:20.840]  This is a on fire
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:22.840]  Flaming tyranny
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:24.840]  They are going through every historical example
[01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:27.840]  Of oppression and secret police
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:29.840]  Stuff that when I was growing up
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:31.840]  Was just everybody knew was Soviet Union
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:33.840]  Or beyond it
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:35.840]  Gerald, you were making a point, please continue
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:37.840]  Yes, the point is
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:40.840]  Have you seen one head roll?
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:43.840]  Not one
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:49.840]  Hello?
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:51.840]  No, I mean I'm listening
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:54.840]  I mean I'm asking you
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:57.840]  Have you seen anybody doing any time?
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:54:59.840]  I saw Cheney making the rounds
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:01.840]  Hawking his new book
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:03.840]  You know, and all the prostitutes
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:05.840]  Nobody threw him the hard question
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:08.840]  The war was started for fake reasons
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:10.840]  You know his responses
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:12.840]  No one could deny
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:15.840]  That the world is better off
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:17.840]  Without Saddam Hussein
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:19.840]  Oh yeah, my life is great
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:22.840]  Everything's dandy without Saddam
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:24.840]  Hey listen, Dick
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:26.840]  Or is it penis Cheney
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:29.840]  You said that they had weapons of mass destruction
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:31.840]  And ties to Al Qaeda
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:33.840]  You destroyed a whole country
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:36.840]  You ruined the lives of so many thousands
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:38.840]  Of our people
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:41.840]  And slaughtered hundreds of thousands
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:44.840]  If not millions of Iraqis
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:46.840]  How about the facts
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:49.840]  How about bringing him and Bush up on
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:51.840]  War criminal charges
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:54.840]  How about that Tony the poodle Blair
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:56.840]  Over there in the UK
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:59.840]  How about all these people that you mentioned
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:01.840]  Not one of them
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:03.840]  Not one of them head roll
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:06.840]  The only ones that get stopped are you and me
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:09.840]  And all the rest of the people out there
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:13.840]  That have become slaves to the system
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:15.840]  It's as clear as that
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:17.840]  No no that's it
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:19.840]  They're criminals and they're trying to
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:22.840]  They're criminals and they're trying to break our will
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:24.840]  And train us that we are their prisoners
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:27.840]  So what do we do about it Gerald and where is it going
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:31.840]  My only solution and I keep talking about it
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:33.840]  Is direct democracy
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:35.840]  Because any adult thinking
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:38.840]  That oh we're going to give Congress
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:40.840]  A list of our demands
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:42.840]  Oh yeah the bananas and the gambinos
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:45.840]  Are going to become nice overnight and listen to you
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:47.840]  No we have to vote
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:50.840]  If we could vote for politicians
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:52.840]  We can vote for issues
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:55.840]  We do not have a representative form of government
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:58.840]  The only people they represent are the people
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:00.840]  That give them money
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:02.840]  And people say to me well Mr. Solanti
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:04.840]  If we let the people vote
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:06.840]  We'll have mob rule
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:08.840]  Yeah just like we have it now
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:10.840]  The mob is ruling
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:12.840]  They call the Republicans and the Democrats
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:16.840]  A gang of 535 congressmen
[01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:20.840]  Telling 312 million people
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:22.840]  What to do in one hour lives
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:25.840]  What are you kidding me or what
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:27.840]  They don't represent me
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:30.840]  If I could vote on bank online
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:32.840]  I could vote online
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:34.840]  You want to take us to war
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:36.840]  You want to end the war
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:38.840]  You want to keep the war on drugs going
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:41.840]  You want to keep re-instituting the Patriot Act
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:43.840]  Let the people vote
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:46.840]  That to me is the only solution
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:50.840]  Well there's no doubt that our republic is broken
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:53.840]  My issue is the awakening is happening
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:55.840]  We're going to go to break we've got 15 more minutes with Gerald
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:58.840]  I want to talk about the trends you see coming in the future
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:00.840]  Because so often we talk about
[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:02.840]  Things are unfolding as you said they would
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:04.840]  What do you see in your crystal ball
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:06.840]  We're going to break here in a moment
[01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:08.840]  And tell us about your latest trends journal

[02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:54.840]  The journal and more
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:57.840]  This is a short segment we'll come back in the next segment
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:00.840]  Gerald but getting into future Trends
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:03.840]  I mean you say well you're hardened by people
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:05.840]  Actually getting in the streets
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:07.840]  Even if they're not completely focused
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:09.840]  But you were acting like you didn't predict that
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:11.840]  You did say four or five years ago
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:14.840]  You started seeing taxpayer rebellions
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:16.840]  And that's the Tea Party
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:18.840]  And we have the Occupy the Fed movement
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:20.840]  Going after the white shoe boys
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:22.840]  What do you predict coming up in the future Gerald?
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:24.840]  Well we're just going back to that
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:25.840]  No I did predict it
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:28.840]  I was just wondering what was taking them so long
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:30.840]  And I realized it
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:32.840]  That it's not on man as hell anymore
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:34.840]  And I'm not going to take it
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:37.840]  It's not a head issue
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:39.840]  Now it's a gut issue
[02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:41.840]  I'm broke as hell
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:43.840]  And I have nothing to lose
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:45.840]  That's very different
[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:47.840]  And by the way Alex
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:49.840]  I wrote this book Trends 2000
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:51.840]  In 1996
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:53.840]  It was a Warner book
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:55.840]  It was a national bestseller
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:57.840]  No I remember my dad reading it
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:01:59.840]  I predicted in this book
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:01.840]  The Uncivil Wars
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:04.840]  And that people would be taking to Wall Street
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:07.840]  Because of the gap between the rich and the poor
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:10.840]  So what we're saying is
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:13.840]  This is the beginning of the total movement
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:16.840]  The entire world economic system
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:18.840]  Is collapsing
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:20.840]  So what am I doing?
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:23.840]  I'm still very heavily invested in gold
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:25.840]  And now I bought some silver
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:28.840]  And I'm back in silver because
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:30.840]  I'm concerned
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:34.840]  That just as they throw these false flags out there
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:36.840]  They're going to start blaming people
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:40.840]  Who buy gold and speculate in the market
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:43.840]  For crashing the fiat currencies
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:45.840]  So as you well know they regulated
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:48.840]  The supply and sale of gold before
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:51.840]  And I'm concerned they might do that again
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:55.840]  So that's why I'm in both precious metals
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:57.840]  Well I tend to agree with you Gerald
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:02:59.840]  They're really starting to beat the drum in that direction
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:01.840]  So what do we do?
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:03.840]  I mean I'm to the point where I'm buying my gold
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:05.840]  And I'm not turning it into these crooks
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:07.840]  Well my gold's away from here
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:09.840]  They're not going to be able to get it
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:11.840]  Unless they can swim really far
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:13.840]  You know?
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:15.840]  And so I'm not
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:17.840]  So I don't intend to
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:19.840]  They're not going to get it
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:21.840]  They won't be able to find it
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:23.840]  Unless they go to another country to get it
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:26.840]  So having said that
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:29.840]  What I'm saying to people is that
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:31.840]  This is not going to be the autumn
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:33.840]  Of the Arab spring type
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:36.840]  This is going to be the winter of discontent
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:38.840]  This thing is collapsing real quick
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:41.840]  The issues over in Europe have not gone away
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:43.840]  Dexia, that huge bank
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:45.840]  That huge French Belgium bank
[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:48.840]  Collapsed a couple of weeks ago
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:50.840]  They've had five of them collapse
[02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:53.840]  They've had five banks collapse in the last two weeks
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:55.840]  But Dexia alone, do you know what it's costing
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:03:57.840]  Belgium to bail them out?
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:01.840]  It's equivalent to 17% of their GDP
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:05.840]  2% of France's GDP
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:08.840]  This is one stinking bank
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:10.840]  Multiply that
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:12.840]  There's no way of bailing them out
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:15.840]  Greeks are about a half a trillion dollars in debt
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:18.840]  The pigs, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Spain
[02:04:18.840 --> 02:04:22.840]  Are four and a half trillion dollars in debt
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:25.840]  They're not going to be able to bail them out
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:28.840]  They're only going to keep printing this digital money
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:31.840]  That's not worth the paper it's not printed on
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:33.840]  So we're telling people
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:35.840]  Be prepared this winter
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:37.840]  Oh, you know what they're doing over there in Greece
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:39.840]  As though it's not hard enough
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:42.840]  They're just raising the costs and taxes
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:46.840]  On heating fuel getting ready for the winter
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:48.840]  We'll give it to them again
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:51.840]  Stay there, Gerald
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:53.840]  I want to come back and talk more about
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:55.840]  Trends you see coming up and finish up
[02:04:55.840 --> 02:04:57.840]  With the austerity measures hitting Europe
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:04:59.840]  And now the United States will be right back
[02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:28.840]  Stay with us
[02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:30.840]  I can't stress this enough
[02:05:30.840 --> 02:05:32.840]  You should at least watch this free video online today
[02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:34.840]  He explains everything you need to know
[02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:37.840]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself

[02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:05.500]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:09.820]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.820 --> 02:06:14.480]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:15.480]  you to have.
[02:06:15.480 --> 02:06:21.160]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:21.160 --> 02:06:25.480]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:29.520]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:33.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:36.720]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:41.400]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:45.240]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:46.640]  one of my old sponsors.
[02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:52.480]  You can get more information at www.MySolarBackup.com, that's MySolarBackup.com.

[02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:15.400]  and high food costs.

[02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:22.800]  like E. Coli and Salmonella?
[02:07:22.800 --> 02:07:26.960]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.

[02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:06.920]  And this is Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's
[02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:09.440]  a war on for your mind.
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:16.240]  Okay, it's our final segment with Gerald Salente and then coming up at the bottom of
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:20.920]  the hour, part two of our interview live, we'll be talking to Dr. Steve Pachanik again
[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:25.240]  about this attempt to move us towards war with Iran as Ray McGovern and others have
[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:26.240]  concurred.
[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:28.040]  This is the closest to war we've been.
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:31.880]  They've tried several times, we'll talk about the ramifications of that and hit some other
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:35.080]  important news that's at infowars.com and prisonplotted.com.
[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:42.440]  But finishing up with Gerald Salente, he just joined us, he was getting into the fact that
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:47.120]  the mainstream corporate prostitutes, as he calls them, continue, and Osama bin Bernaki
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:54.400]  and the rest of them to tell us, another one of his funny phrases I love, continues, tell
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:57.960]  us everything's fine, there's been no recession, it's been over for years.
[02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:01.840]  But now they're starting to say, well, it's the greatest challenge since the Great Depression
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:06.880]  and their answer is, let these big banker heads steal trillions out the back door, have
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:13.360]  record bonuses, but then bankrupt the banks and get more taxpayer money and then lecture
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:16.000]  us how it's our fault.
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.840]  And that's the only problem with Occupy Wall Street.
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:22.800]  Some of them don't understand higher taxes, higher regulation, that all goes to the white
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:29.560]  shoe boys, to the insiders, to the establishment types, and again, white shoe boy and other
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:36.440]  great Gerald Salente term, but that's kind of the white tuxedo boys, these are the so-called
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:42.280]  elite of the elite, they think we exist to be toilet paper for them and there's no end
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:46.240]  to their hubris and raw criminal behavior.
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:50.320]  The good news is I'm reading in Spain and in Greece and other areas, restaurants are
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:53.320]  all refusing to even charge the VAT period.
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:57.840]  You got Herman Cain pushing for new VAT taxes to pay off our, quote, debt here, he meets
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:01.000]  the fellow reserve he worked for.
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:05.480]  And so they're going to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze, Gerald, will they be successful?
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:09.680]  Again, how does this end historically looking into your crystal ball?
[02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:20.000]  Here it is, autumn 2009, the second American revolution has begun.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:24.640]  It's happening, it's what you were talking about, Alex, enough people are waking up.
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:26.240]  This is real.
[02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:28.960]  The white shoe boys are so far out of touch.
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:36.400]  You listen to the comments by Cain, as you mentioned, Mitt Romney, let's not look for
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:43.960]  scapegoats as he chastises the Wall Street protest, scapegoats, oh no, they're not angry,
[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:50.320]  they're looking for scapegoats, they're looking for financial pigs and corporate vultures
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:57.560]  just like you, Romney, and then you listen to billionaire Bloomberg, ah, they're protesting
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:01.240]  against the wrong people, do you know what Bloomberg said, Alex?
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:05.200]  Those people on Wall Street, you know, kind of money they're making on average according
[02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:12.360]  to his honor to billionaire, oh, 40 or $50,000 a year, yeah, right, you know what they're
[02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:21.360]  making on Wall Street on average, Alex, try $360,000 a year, oh, that's according to the
[02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:28.240]  New York State Controller's Office, I'm not making that number up, they're so far out
[02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:35.600]  of touch, you see, Bloomberg is right, you know, he's making $40,000 or $50,000 a year,
[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:41.200]  the groundskeepers over at the country club, the people that hand them the washcloths,
[02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:47.640]  you know, the servants and the turrets, those are the people making 40 or $50,000 a year,
[02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:54.600]  so they have no idea what's going on, we are entering very closely, Alex, to a let them
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:12:02.240]  eat cake moment because that's how far removed they are, the revolution has begun and they
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:07.800]  will not admit it, they will try to stop it, they won't be able to.
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:14.360]  Well, Gerald, here's my next question for you, I have a USA Today here in my hot little
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:19.960]  hand and they're saying now, starting at Boston, but then all over the country, they're going
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:26.440]  to stop and talk to you and ask you where you're going, why you're going, who you're
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:30.840]  going to visit, they call it a chat down, but they're also going to keep the groping
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:38.920]  of the genitals, the wave shish kebobbing and now you're going to have to have a TSA person,
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:43.920]  the people literally every day caught robbing and pedophiling and everything else, they're
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:48.160]  now saying that you're going to have to answer these guys' questions, listen, that's worse
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:52.680]  than me putting a barbecue machine, having them act like I've done something wrong, I
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:57.160]  mean, should I say to them, I need to assess, are you one of these myriad TSA that are pedophiles
[02:12:57.160 --> 02:13:01.240]  or that are robbing people's bags, I mean, this is all about a secret police, now the
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:06.960]  NFL are going to grope from the ankles up and grab your breast and genitals and they
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:11.640]  go, just get tough, take it, it's not that I'm not tough, it's that I want to get angry
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:16.980]  when somebody sticks their hands between my legs, okay, that's for my, again, Gerald,
[02:13:16.980 --> 02:13:21.880]  how much do we have to take from this bureaucratic snot nose class that works for these filthy
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:22.880]  bankers?
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:28.660]  Exactly, that's it, there's nothing more than enforces for the political and financial
[02:13:28.660 --> 02:13:35.880]  crime bosses, let's call it what it is, fascism, it's not only the TSA, I mean, it gets stopped
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:41.760]  by a cop, where are you coming from, where are you going, you know, hey, does your mother
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:47.280]  still have sex with dogs, I mean, that's what I like to ask them, you know, I mean, what's
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:53.800]  going on in this country, we got a bunch of people that are trying to break down our will
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:14:02.120]  and our spirit, rob us of our self respect, and they're doing it because the system is
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:04.480]  collapsing.
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:09.200]  And so what they're going to keep doing, as you said, they're going to keep groping
[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:14.880]  and getting inside us as close as they can to break down our will and spirit, they're
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:21.560]  going to lose, well that's what I'm saying, listen, Gerald, Gerald, I'm sorry, I interrupted
[02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:27.360]  repeat that, I'm seeing this TSA stuff and all this doing the opposite, it's enraging
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:32.280]  us but I think because their little bootlicking chicken wimps themselves, they think we're
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:37.320]  like them, no, the American people see this Nazi Germany garbage for what it is and it's
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:38.920]  enraging them, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:45.560]  No, you're right, and that's what I'm saying, the revolution has begun, they're going to
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:55.320]  do everything they can in Gestapo USA to keep pushing us down so we don't rise up, the human
[02:14:55.320 --> 02:15:01.720]  spirit is rising, what's going on again, you know, with this Occupy Wall Street, it's in
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:07.720]  Birmingham, it's in Portland, it's in Seattle, it's in Denver, it's in Fort Collins, it's
[02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:14.720]  in Trenton, it's happening all over, the people have had it, you know my saying, when people
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:21.440]  lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it and the white shoe boys in their
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:27.880]  gated communities are not going to be protected from it and I'll tell you why they're coming
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:36.880]  out so strongly against it because in the back of their mind, they can see a guillotine
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:44.880]  in a theater playing near you soon and that's what they're afraid of.
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:49.400]  Gerald, when I interrupted you, it sounded like you were starting to say New World Order,
[02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:51.200]  what was it you were about to say a minute or two ago?
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:57.520]  It is a New World Order and not that one, a New World Order is taking place to overthrow
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:05.000]  the old one, Alex, they use the term democracy, no we have a democracy in France, a democracy
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:11.240]  in the United States, in Italy, they're not democracies, these are mafia clubs with fancy
[02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:19.880]  names, you know, like they have people like Jean-Paul Trichet and Cristina Legrand, looking
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:26.200]  Luciano and Al Capone and the people are getting hip to it, these are not democracies, we have
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:31.240]  a small group of people telling us what to do and the rest of the people are rebelling,
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:35.760]  look, we've had people down on Occupy Wall Street since it began and we've been talking
[02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:40.680]  to everybody, they don't like any of them, they don't like the Republicans, they hate
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:45.360]  the Democrats, you know, a lot of these people are Ron's Paul supporters.
[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:50.680]  No, I agree, but the people that the mainstream media shows are the people that want higher
[02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:55.480]  taxes and more austerity so they skew it and then we tried to have Ron Paul signs, they
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:17:00.480]  have organizers come over and say shut up, but you know, that's why they fired Hank Williams
[02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:06.880]  Jr. from Monday Night Football, what he actually said on Fox News was I hate all these Republicans,
[02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:12.080]  the American people, 89% hate Congress, I'm sick of them all, then he made the Hitler
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:16.560]  comment, they took that out of context, they went after him because he was saying I'm sick
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:17.560]  of everybody.
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:24.760]  Exactly, and that's what I'm saying, there is going to be a new world order, the ones
[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:33.120]  that the elites have put in place is breaking down, something else is going to happen, again
[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:40.840]  the second American revolution has begun, we are inspiring the whole world, they are
[02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:52.840]  occupying now in Seoul, in Sydney, in Melbourne, in Taiwan, in London, in Tokyo, they are picking
[02:17:52.840 --> 02:18:00.040]  up the greatness of the American spirit that they have been trying to push down for so
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:09.200]  long with their stupidity and with their manipulation, you can't kill the human spirit.
[02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:14.320]  Well, beautifully said, they are not going to be able to co-opt, occupy Wall Street
[02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:17.000]  completely, they are not going to be able to co-opt the Tea Party completely, they are
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:21.680]  not going to be able to have minimum wage people groping us, making us submit, it only
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:26.960]  makes us wake up and take action, Gerald again, I know you've got several URLs to get to the
[02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:30.280]  Trends Journal, which one is the best one for people to go to?
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:36.200]  TrendsJournal.com, TrendsJournal.com, and also for those people that believe or want
[02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:43.720]  to learn more about direct democracy, please go to directdemocracy.org.
[02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:49.920]  The future is in your hands, either you create the greatness of what this country and world
[02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:57.040]  could be or somebody else is going to create it for you, they're waiting online to do it
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:00.080]  and you're not going to like it.
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:03.160]  Gerald Salente, thanks for spending time with us, talk to you soon.
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:04.160]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:07.480]  Well, that was an amazing interview, we're going to go to break, I'm going to cover a
[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:11.280]  few other news items, and Dr. Steve Pachennick's going to pop back in, he was with us for two
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:16.160]  segments yesterday, I'll be with us for two segments again today, I love him or hate him,
[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:20.640]  he certainly is a big insider and he says they're really greenlighting the attack, I
[02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:24.280]  got some good news from Schaefer, he thinks that's being backed off from Colonel Schaefer,
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:27.880]  then we've also got Ray McGovern saying no, this is the green light unless we get the
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:33.520]  word out, so it's a very, very dangerous time right now, and the bankers want a war even
[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:39.760]  if it's disastrous to distract off of what they're doing and fast and furious, and then
[02:19:39.760 --> 02:19:46.520]  don't forget, coming up tonight at 7 o'clock, Aaron Dykes, last night doing the Infowars
[02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:51.920]  Nightly News, was of course the health ranger, Mike Adams, appreciate the great job he did,
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:57.080]  and also all these amazing guest information research, we couldn't do any of it without
[02:19:57.080 --> 02:20:00.680]  our wonderful crew, the Infowars crew, I salute you.
[02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:05.200]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:10.360]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle, did you know that in a real meltdown,
[02:20:10.360 --> 02:20:13.840]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold, it's true seeds have
[02:20:13.840 --> 02:20:17.320]  all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could
[02:20:17.320 --> 02:20:21.880]  even happen again, so our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect
[02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:28.080]  mix of non-hybrid seeds, they call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:32.620]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family, and here's the best part, these seeds have

[02:21:00.720 --> 02:21:05.440]  Did you know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted down reactors in Fukushima,
[02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:08.680]  Japan, and making its way across the entire US continent?
[02:21:08.680 --> 02:21:14.080]  Contaminating the air, water, and food, dangerously high levels of radiation are a reality here,
[02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:19.000]  as a result, radiation poisoning is a distinct possibility for anyone living in the US, unless

[02:24:08.640 --> 02:24:14.280]  All right, Gerald wanted to clarify as he went to break. It's directdemocracynow.com
[02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:19.080]  is the website he was promoting. You know, I don't particularly like direct democracy
[02:24:19.080 --> 02:24:24.760]  versus a republic. The problem is we don't even have a republic. So my concern is during
[02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:32.680]  a crisis, the globalists could manipulate people into stampeding into anything. But
[02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:38.320]  as long as there were basic rules, that's really what a republic is where you can't
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:46.760]  take somebody's private property if it wasn't taken through real gain. I mean, I see Salento
[02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:52.880]  Brooks takeover. But it's so far gone at this point. You know, just getting people to think
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:58.000]  about political systems is great. So we really like Gerald Salente, obviously great, great,
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:07.480]  great mind, very interesting fellow. Look, we got some really incredible news. In fact,
[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:11.440]  we can put this up on screen while I'm talking about it in the feature news section. Press
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:16.720]  TV has been taken off the air in the UK. The war for our freedom of speech is now on. I've
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:24.160]  been a guest on Iranian TV. I've been a guest on Japanese TV, Russian TV, British TV, neo
[02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:31.400]  cons write articles and say he's an Iranian agent. He was on their TV. He was on British
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:39.040]  TV. He's a red coat. I mean, it's just mindlessness, but pretty mild stuff on there. But the British
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:44.680]  News is reporting the royal family didn't like reports on press TV about their opulent
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:51.080]  lifestyle. And so it's been taken off the air in the UK. And I was talking to one UK
[02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:55.080]  channel that wants to put my TV show on and they said, but the problem is the censors
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:26:00.000]  call and they could take our whole channel away if we criticize vaccines. They told us
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:03.920]  just don't talk bad about vaccines. I'm like, well, what if you have proof? Well, just
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:10.080]  that they can take our license. So that's the type of garbage we have there. IEA to
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:14.760]  release evidence. Iran is secretly working on new program. Curt Nemo has that. Notice
[02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:22.640]  this is all coming right on time. Representative King labels Iran terror plot active war. Republican
[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:27.200]  congressman says Obama should have troops on standby for military response. This is
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:33.440]  how serious the green lighting is. Scientific study confirms Ron Paul being given least
[02:26:33.440 --> 02:26:38.120]  FaceTime in debates. Even worse than Gary Johnson. I mean, Ron Paul get three, four
[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:41.160]  minutes. The others get on average about eight and a half. Go look at that article just to
[02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:45.880]  show you how scared they are of him. They're not scared of Mr. 999. They're like, give
[02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:53.840]  us those new taxes. Continuing here. House bill of criminalized satire of TSA. Go read
[02:26:53.840 --> 02:27:01.000]  the bill. In fact, the evil thought crime cartoon Curt Nemo has in the article would
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:11.280]  be illegal. Also, Nemo's been on fire lately. I told him to make some nom de gears or some
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:15.400]  pen names because it's like half the articles are written by him. I'm just joking. He's
[02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:21.320]  a great guy. It's it's it's you know what? We can't find folks like Nemo. Nemo's don't
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:32.000]  grow on trees. Neither do Watson's or or Dyches. Let's go or Stevie Watson's FBI. Records
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:37.320]  talk radio. They've they've gotten an intelligence agency connected group. A huge contract to
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:42.880]  record quote all internet broadcast talk radio and put it into a database to track all the
[02:27:42.880 --> 02:27:50.080]  good little slaves. Also, assassination plot was pushed by DEA informant meet the new boss
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:54.560]  same as the old boss. You know, some pothead being lured along. But we got to have war
[02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:58.640]  with Iran now because the pothead said it's going to get us. It's very frightening. Thank
[02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:03.200]  goodness the TSA is going to ask me questions now. And I've got to sit there and please
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:07.640]  them. No fly and they're going to be at the sports stadiums and checkpoints on the highways.
[02:28:07.640 --> 02:28:13.080]  And now at high school problems, TSA going down the pants. Well, hey, pedophiles need
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:19.560]  jobs too. I mean, come on. Continuing here. Petrae SCI fuels Iran murder plot. Ray McGovern
[02:28:19.560 --> 02:28:24.480]  got a report on that. We had him on the first hour. We had Anthony Schaefer on, of course,
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:30.000]  after that. And then Gerald Salante. What a jam packed transmission. And so that's just
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:37.600]  some of the news that we've got up at info wars.com and prison planet.com cops have broken
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:44.720]  up occupied Denver camp. Now, now what happened is, is that a month ago, ad busters, other
[02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:50.240]  democratic connected groups, they put out calls for occupied Wall Street thinking Democrats
[02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:55.080]  could then show up and steer it. That failed. So Democrats went from praising it two weeks
[02:28:55.080 --> 02:29:00.360]  ago and last week to now all over the country, breaking up the camps and getting rid of people
[02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:05.080]  because too many Ron Paul supporters showed up for educating him. So so now they've shifted
[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:09.440]  from trying to make it about we want more taxes to pay Warren Buffett and Lord Rothschild
[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:15.880]  tax people making $5, give it to banks and austerity. That didn't work. And so now they've
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:21.680]  shifted gears into cracking down on them all over the place. And so that's just some of
[02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:24.720]  the news there. We're going to go to brain come back with Dr. Steve Pachennick. When
[02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:28.880]  I'm on the road, I don't tend to plug the online video bookstore slash apparel store.
[02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:31.800]  But that's how you find our operation. Plus everything in there is about getting the word
[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:37.280]  out, whether it's the don't tread on me, Alex Jones signed flags or the info wars.com
[02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:41.160]  camouflage or under orange caps. Everything in there is about getting the word out unless
[02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:46.160]  you're talking about the pro pure best gravity fed filters out there. It blows everything
[02:29:46.160 --> 02:29:51.800]  away. Look at the side by side comparisons with leading competition. We're on the March,
[02:29:51.800 --> 02:30:03.480]  the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Hi, folks, this is Alex
[02:30:03.480 --> 02:30:08.280]  Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognize
[02:30:08.280 --> 02:30:13.160]  risk. Saving means to make money. The cow been pure soap company can save you thousands
[02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:17.840]  of dollars and give you good old fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and
[02:30:17.840 --> 02:30:22.920]  twice as good as what you're using now. Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that

[02:31:22.520 --> 02:31:27.960]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program

[02:32:00.960 --> 02:32:07.880]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the
[02:32:07.880 --> 02:32:12.360]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:22.200]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They so pride
[02:32:22.200 --> 02:32:31.480]  in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the
[02:32:31.480 --> 02:32:39.600]  crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[02:32:39.600 --> 02:32:46.360]  They turn jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:32:46.360 --> 02:32:50.920]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can
[02:32:50.920 --> 02:32:58.080]  ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it,
[02:32:58.080 --> 02:33:01.240]  others don't.
[02:33:01.240 --> 02:33:09.960]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling
[02:33:09.960 --> 02:33:19.440]  oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude. People can be made to enjoy a state
[02:33:19.440 --> 02:33:25.440]  of affairs which by any decent standard they ought not to enjoy.
[02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:36.600]  I have sure better start from the beginning. I have sure better start from the beginning.
[02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:41.800]  I have sure better start from the beginning.
[02:33:41.800 --> 02:33:44.880]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:49.160]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools. They don't have stable parents making good
[02:33:49.160 --> 02:33:51.920]  decisions.
[02:33:51.920 --> 02:33:57.240]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[02:33:57.240 --> 02:34:02.040]  Pediatric. These new studies suggest that the offices that the preservatives may actually
[02:34:02.040 --> 02:34:05.160]  be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:10.120]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay but could it also cause cancer?
[02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:15.000]  I doubt the government had the right under U.S. law to conduct secret testing on the
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.200]  American public under a specific condition.
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:21.760]  I have to work a dark side while I spend time in the shadows.
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:27.200]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil. Well, join me and I'm
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:32.920]  glad to sit here at the right hand to say there's a need for a new world order.
[02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:55.320]  One day in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:35:00.120]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central, we're here live. Coming back this
[02:35:00.120 --> 02:35:04.840]  Sunday, 4-6 p.m. central, I'm Alex Jones. You have found at the front lines of the
[02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:10.440]  Info War and the fight for worldwide freedom and defense of our constitutional republic.
[02:35:10.440 --> 02:35:15.760]  Our websites are infowars.com and, of course, prisonplanet.tv. And we'll be back tonight
[02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:19.320]  at 7 o'clock central, 8 o'clock eastern, where they're on dykes. We'll be hosting
[02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:23.560]  Info Wars Nightly News this evening, and they'll have a rundown posted later in the
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:26.520]  day at infowars.com with what's coming up.
[02:35:26.520 --> 02:35:31.080]  Now, I want to attempt, it's not hard to give them the floor, because he's got a lot to
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:36.040]  say, to ask a few questions, Dr. Pachennick, and then have him just go through them. Obviously,
[02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:42.280]  co-author of many best-selling books with Tom Clancy. He's produced movies, TV shows,
[02:35:42.280 --> 02:35:50.280]  but he's less known for being involved in programs with the death of basically manipulating
[02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:56.500]  the communist of the prime minister of Italy, overthrowing other governments, writing psychological
[02:35:56.500 --> 02:36:01.240]  warfare manual for the State Department, running operations himself, including assassinations
[02:36:01.240 --> 02:36:02.240]  worldwide.
[02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:07.040]  So he's a real insider expert on what's happening. And we saw Dr. Pachennick come out yesterday.
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:11.600]  We've seen Bob Baer, the former CIA, Black Hop field guy come out and say, this whole
[02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:16.480]  Iranian plot's totally fake to get us into a war with Iran. We've seen Colonel Schaefer
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:21.440]  come on earlier and say, he's no fan of Iran, but this is totally sage. And he has FBI sources
[02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:25.200]  that he met with again, who've got high-level security clearance in the FBI. They say it's
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:31.000]  totally fake. He was on with it for 30 minutes last hour, or the hour before that now. So
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:37.240]  much coming out, ladies and gentlemen. And you've got this big Iran expert from the last
[02:36:37.240 --> 02:36:41.600]  Bush administration coming out on CNN. You name it, saying it's all totally fake. Now
[02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:47.360]  we learned the after David that the guy was a mindless pothead drunk car salesman, not
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:51.640]  being bad being a car salesman, but that's what he was. And he was trying to do a drug
[02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:55.200]  deal. It was all just made up. The informant just made it all up. That's all coming out
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:59.360]  in the niche. But representative Peter King and others say, this is an act of war, launch
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:04.960]  a war that we're being told. More Iran stuff's about to come out. So my questions are, why
[02:37:04.960 --> 02:37:10.320]  is this happening now? Is it just a smoke screen from Fast and Furious and Obama shipping
[02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:14.440]  guns into Mexico and drugs back in? That's in the federal court documents. They're hoping
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:18.520]  the media doesn't look at that. It's public. We've posted links to the federal court house
[02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:23.600]  showing it. Or is it about getting Netanyahu out of trouble? Or is it all the same? The
[02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:29.320]  global financial meltdown? Do they need a war? What is happening here? And is it good
[02:37:29.320 --> 02:37:34.280]  news that we're seeing? I counted up yesterday and today more than 60 former and current
[02:37:34.280 --> 02:37:42.360]  top analysts, Pentagon, the CIA, the state department, all coming out and going against
[02:37:42.360 --> 02:37:47.040]  the teleprompter readers. They're all saying, war, war, war. Iran wants to get us. But all
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:52.520]  the analysts, I mean, I'd say 90% I've seen are saying this is total baloney. I can't
[02:37:52.520 --> 02:37:56.720]  think of a time where I saw that. I mean, that really, I talked to Colonel Schaefer
[02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:01.000]  earlier. He said his Pentagon sources say they don't have the assets, even if they wanted
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:05.440]  to do it, it's not happening. But other sources like Ray McGovern, who was on earlier, he
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:10.120]  says the word is they're really going for it. So let's see what Dr. Pachennik has to
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:14.240]  say. Sir, you've got the floor for the balance of the 22 minutes we've got left. You heard
[02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:18.080]  my questions. Please try to address them as best you can.
[02:38:18.080 --> 02:38:22.160]  Thank you very much. I want to thank your audience. Number one, I think the fact that
[02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:29.240]  60 to 70 analysts came forward is in part, you have to take some credit at stations that
[02:38:29.240 --> 02:38:35.720]  people like you and others who are willing to brave the scyops of not just one administration
[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:39.800]  were going all the way back to the Clinton administration, which did the rendition by
[02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:43.840]  the way, Bill Clinton reaffirmed that his wife was correct about the assumptions. This
[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:48.440]  is one of the biggest pathological liars in the world, reaffirming another pathological
[02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:53.320]  liar statement. So you see what we have a compounding pathological liars. Then we have
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:59.760]  Bush Jr., who made up all of the 9-11 standout false flag, distorted the intelligence data
[02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:06.240]  coming in to invade Iraq. And now you have Obama following in the course of Bush Jr.
[02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:11.440]  and Clinton and what's happening in the United States. And I'm very proud of our analysts,
[02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:16.400]  our intelligence operatives out there, and particularly the military who have said, this
[02:39:16.400 --> 02:39:24.000]  is enough. Many generals and colonels in non-commissioned officers can't stand out right now because
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:28.720]  they don't want to be quarreled on Georgia's attrition. I do not speak on their behalf,
[02:39:28.720 --> 02:39:35.200]  but I do as a veteran, a former colonel, retired to say the following. It is enough. The American
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:40.560]  public has had, is disgusted with the elected officials, both Republicans and Democrats,
[02:39:40.560 --> 02:39:46.800]  what we have not heard was anyone of the Democratic senators, congressmen standing up and denouncing
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:52.320]  what were clear travesty of justice. At the same time, we have not heard, I have not heard
[02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:58.400]  Romney or Perry say anything, let alone Perry, who's the governor of your state. And by the
[02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:03.440]  way, we do have an invasion, but ironically, it's not Iran because Iran doesn't need to
[02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:09.000]  invade us. They do not have targeted assassinations here. The target assassinations I dealt with
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:15.680]  in Iran with the M.E.K., which is called the Mujahideen, and we have people like the former
[02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:25.800]  FBI director, Free, and others, including Dean Howard Dean, supporting the delisting
[02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:30.800]  of a terrorist group, which is literally a terrorist group, killed a lot of my operatives
[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:38.520]  in the 1970s and 80s in Tehran, who are in fact assassins. I don't excuse, I'm in
[02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:45.000]  the shot, I don't excuse how many, but I have worked against them, but I have worked effectively
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:50.280]  against really an assassination group, which is, and still is, the Mujahideen. So, what
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:56.200]  we have here is distortion, psi-up, disinformation. What we have on the other side, the incredibly
[02:40:56.200 --> 02:41:00.880]  great news, is that you, and I give you a lot of credit, and your audience, and the 10
[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:05.120]  million people are listening, that they're being informed, and that the alternative
[02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:09.000]  media, which is what we're considered, or the conspiracy group, which is what we're
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:14.000]  titled, is really in fact the mainstream media, and the people that you see, and I was quite
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:19.880]  impressed that CNN did bring in an analyst who announced this. I was very impressed that
[02:41:19.880 --> 02:41:26.680]  Abrams and the new editor-in-chief of the New York Times did run this article on this
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:32.680]  wayward bomb, really, Iranian, who no Iranian official or operative would ever use this
[02:41:32.680 --> 02:41:40.280]  type of individual to engage in any form of counterterrorism or terrorism. Now, the issue
[02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:45.200]  there was, it was so obvious because the DEA is an organization which should have been
[02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:52.760]  evaluated and literally downsized very quickly. It is a corrupt, ineffectual organization.
[02:41:52.760 --> 02:41:57.640]  I have dealt with them in Panama and elsewhere. They play double tricks. They double every
[02:41:57.640 --> 02:42:02.680]  agent. They themselves are exceedingly corrupt, but nobody monitors them, and our congressmen
[02:42:02.680 --> 02:42:07.800]  and senators are not capable of monitoring them, as is the ATF, another organization
[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:13.440]  that has absolutely no utility whatsoever. We've talked about the CIA and the fact that
[02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:18.560]  they've been out of control for a very, very long time. I've said repeatedly that Obama's
[02:42:18.560 --> 02:42:24.960]  parents had nothing to do with the false birth as much as his mother was CIA, his grandfather
[02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:29.920]  was CIA, and his grandmother. The question is, this president does not belong here. He
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:36.320]  is shown repeatedly that he is incapable of managing a domestic economy. He is shown
[02:42:36.320 --> 02:42:41.320]  incapable of running and understanding what it means to health care program, and he has
[02:42:41.320 --> 02:42:46.760]  been in bed repeatedly with the bankers. And the worst banker of all and the worst wealth
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:54.760]  manager was Barron Buffett, who's now playing an amazing game of PsyOps with the young protesters
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:43:00.600]  in New York and Chicago. This is a man who claims that he will increase his taxes, and
[02:43:00.600 --> 02:43:06.400]  of course only pay 17% of his taxes that he would need, 69 million, but didn't tell anybody
[02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:12.160]  that he also invested in the Bank of America, $5 million billion, with an 8% interest. He
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:17.760]  didn't tell you that he owned 40% of booties, which went under, and he was guilty of criminal
[02:43:17.760 --> 02:43:19.320]  activities, but was never indicted.
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:26.600]  Well, he gets the banker bailout money, but Steve's still out. No more war. No, no more
[02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:27.600]  war.
[02:43:27.600 --> 02:43:28.600]  No, no, go ahead.
[02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:33.080]  And we want jobs. It's very simple. If they were recruited, as we were in the Vietnam
[02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:39.960]  days, years, they would have been violently fighting with the police and the military,
[02:43:39.960 --> 02:43:44.960]  and they would have said, this is enough. They are not being drafted, but in fact, their
[02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:50.880]  entire future is being co-opted by a man who has never served our country, Obama, who
[02:43:50.880 --> 02:43:57.480]  never will serve our country, who has always been a pandera, a liar, and an effectual,
[02:43:57.480 --> 02:44:04.080]  and now to have placed another element of disinformation on top of the Osama bin Laden's
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:10.560]  stupidity, which was beyond disinformation and a total disrespect for our special forces
[02:44:10.560 --> 02:44:16.760]  who in fact have been involved in 24-7 operations all over the world. And that's not to denigrate
[02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:22.880]  the SEALs because the SEALs are quite formidable for Admiral Mueller to make a show and tell
[02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:27.960]  out of this. A man whose father was an agent in the William Morris Agency or a publicist
[02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:34.880]  and to promote his own self, the grandisement, by touting SEALs who in fact never did kill
[02:44:34.880 --> 02:44:40.440]  Osama bin Laden because the man's been dead for 10 years. What we have here is a problem
[02:44:40.440 --> 02:44:47.360]  in civilian control. What we have repeatedly has been the failure of the political establishment
[02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:55.160]  starting from the Clinton era to Bush Jr. to the Obama era, and that failure delegitimizes
[02:44:55.160 --> 02:45:00.880]  the political entity, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat. I do not see a very helpful
[02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:07.440]  future in our politicians. I have not seen Romney or King or Perry stand forward.
[02:45:07.440 --> 02:45:13.800]  Above all, you are now being occupied in Austin, Texas, and you probably know this, Alex Jones,
[02:45:13.800 --> 02:45:19.760]  by one of the cartel members, which is called the Farnia Michoacana, the FLM cartel, which
[02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:25.720]  is literally in Austin, Texas. They are trading in drugs. I have not heard a DEA official.
[02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:31.160]  I have not heard a CIA official. I have not heard Governor Perry say anything about the
[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:36.960]  fact that you have an active cartel working in American soil in Austin, Texas, yet they
[02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:43.640]  have all the time and effort to try to start a stand-down phenomenon in order to bail out
[02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:48.640]  Netanyahu. Now, who was Netanyahu? I knew Netanyahu when he was his 30s, and he came
[02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:53.320]  in as the deputy chief of mission. I knew his father better because he was my teacher
[02:45:53.320 --> 02:45:58.480]  at Cornell. I was a exceedingly bright man, and I knew of his brother, who was a very
[02:45:58.480 --> 02:46:03.800]  brave soldier in the Israeli Defense Force, who led all of his men into battle on the
[02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:10.400]  raid of Antebi. And Netanyahu has no shame walking on the body of his brother, on the
[02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:16.240]  blood that his brother shed in order for him, in order for people to be saved in the Antebi
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:22.600]  raid. He himself is not a war hero. He himself is not a man of integrity. He is a totally
[02:46:22.600 --> 02:46:28.320]  dysfunctional, self-aggrandizing politician who has had very little strategic sense of
[02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:34.360]  where to go with Israel or to take the opportunity to make peace with the Palestinians. Now,
[02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:40.960]  every time he negrates Hamas, I warn the Israelis to be very careful because when I worked on
[02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:47.240]  the West Bank, the first thing that the PLO members told me, working in Jericho and sacrificing
[02:46:47.240 --> 02:46:53.640]  my life in Jericho, Bethlehem, and Belze, is that the Israelis had created Hamas as
[02:46:53.640 --> 02:47:00.160]  a counterforce to the PLO. Why did they create Hamas? Because they needed a counterforce
[02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:05.800]  to the Sunni Muslims, and this little Hamas would have influence from Iranians. So they
[02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:11.200]  thought this was a very clever game, and what happened is it's a blowback. So for Netanyahu
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:17.160]  to say that we have a terrorist group that wants to exterminate the Jews, it's palatious,
[02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:22.200]  it's disinformation, and he has to account for the fact that the Israeli IDF and the
[02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:28.880]  Shin Bet, the internal security, created Hamas as a way of creating low-intensity conflict
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:34.040]  was, Kissinger would often say, strategic tension in the area to maintain the sovereignty
[02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:39.120]  of Israel. Now, those of you who think Israel has always been the Jewish homeland for the
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:44.760]  Jews, better think again. Israel was created by Zionists, not only Jews. They were created
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:50.520]  by Polish Jews, Ben-Gurion in particular, who allowed millions, millions of Jews to
[02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:57.480]  perish in the death camps, because Eichmann, who came in 1937, by the way, he spelled Hebrew,
[02:47:57.480 --> 02:48:01.920]  asked him, would you do a transfer exchange for thousands, if not hundreds of thousands
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:08.120]  of Jews, for transportation trucks? Ben-Gurion said no, and his right-hand man said, I would
[02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:13.560]  rather have cows than Jews, and that was the beginning of the state of Israel. This is
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:19.840]  how the Jewish agency handled refugee Jews who were in the camps and being exterminated.
[02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:25.880]  So let no Christian or fundamentalist or Muslim or Jew think that in any way Israel is more
[02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:31.160]  sanctimonious than any other country. It was America that brought in all the Jews from
[02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:35.240]  World War II, and this was what happened in Israel.
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:36.840]  Dr. Pichena, can you hear me?
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:42.280]  The Jews who were in the camps, not until the war of 1968. Why? Because if that war, they
[02:48:42.280 --> 02:48:46.520]  needed more weapons systems. And who did they got to? They went to our president of the
[02:48:46.520 --> 02:48:51.200]  United States, and they're working with Nixon. Nixon provided them with jet planes and the
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:57.080]  necessary equipment that they needed in order to be a major force in the area. From a strategic
[02:48:57.080 --> 02:49:04.040]  point of view, Israel is no longer a valuable ally to us. Why? Because it has created a
[02:49:04.040 --> 02:49:09.400]  lot of problems. It has not, in fact, committed itself to what it should have done many years
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:15.440]  ago, and that was the recognition of the state of Palestine, the honorable release of the
[02:49:15.440 --> 02:49:20.960]  Gaza Strip, which was absolutely inhumane for them to restrict, because it happened
[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:28.040]  to all the Jews. In part, this was the result of the incompetence of a lot of our negotiators,
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:32.720]  in particular, the name Dennis Ross, who worked for me. He worked for the Bush administration,
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:37.040]  the Clinton administration, and he has been totally, totally incompetent in the handle
[02:49:37.040 --> 02:49:38.040]  this situation.
[02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:45.600]  Okay. What happens is, because Pachinik is on a cell phone, and when he's dialed in,
[02:49:45.600 --> 02:49:48.400]  he can't hear me when I talk, so we're going to go to break here in a moment, then I'll
[02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:52.520]  come back and ask some more questions. But interesting stuff he's getting into on Israel.
[02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:54.520]  Doc, can you hear me?
[02:49:54.520 --> 02:49:56.160]  Yes, sir, I have.
[02:49:56.160 --> 02:50:00.280]  Okay, great. You were saying a lot of really interesting things there. You know, I've actually
[02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:04.160]  had Jewish scholars, I've seen write the books about the, I'd rather have you know, cows
[02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:09.760]  in Palestine than one Jew, and they were trying to make the Jews pay money to the folks setting
[02:50:09.760 --> 02:50:13.480]  up Israel to be able to get out of Nazi Germany. And that's actually true. I've actually read
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:18.120]  that in the mainline documents. Most people don't know about that. Obviously, you're well
[02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:22.360]  informed. You do. We're going to break. We're going to come back and talk about that and
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:24.800]  a lot more on the other side.
[02:50:24.800 --> 02:50:26.280]  Thank you.
[02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:35.120]  Thank you. Again, we are talking to Steve Pachennik here today with us. We may have to do a little
[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:39.880]  bit of overdrive for five minutes in the next hour so we can finish up his point on the
[02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:44.760]  other side. Again, I am not in the studio today. I'm here joining you with me as Skype
[02:50:44.760 --> 02:50:51.760]  as well. We'll be right back after this quick break. Stay with us.
[02:50:51.760 --> 02:50:58.760]  Hey, baby, I'm going to leave you.
[02:51:51.760 --> 02:52:05.040]  If you're a man over 40, you may feel like half the man you used to be. Are you gaining

[02:53:01.400 --> 02:53:05.820]  Smokers, are you still smoking traditional cigarettes? Are you still smelling up your
[02:53:05.820 --> 02:53:11.600]  clothes and car interior, staining your teeth and getting ashes everywhere? Why, when you

[02:54:24.320 --> 02:54:27.440]  All right, we're back live and I actually can't go on to overdrive the day. I'd like
[02:54:27.440 --> 02:54:31.680]  to invite Dr. Pachennick back on with us for another 30 minutes next week if he can do
[02:54:31.680 --> 02:54:36.120]  it. He's joining us via cell phones, sometimes he can't hear me when I'm talking to him.
[02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:39.440]  Doc, you know, I read on your Wikipedia, of course, I don't know if that's true. A lot
[02:54:39.440 --> 02:54:43.120]  of stuff on Wikipedia about me isn't true, but it talks about you were born in Cuba
[02:54:43.120 --> 02:54:48.440]  then lived in France before he came to the U.S. and that you yourself were at least part
[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:52.880]  Jewish, so I guess that might be that's true. One reason you're so informed historically
[02:54:52.880 --> 02:54:58.360]  on this, I mean, if you want to tell us, it just would be an interesting piece of history.
[02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:04.800]  But then in closing, is the war on for Iran or were they trying to and this failed and
[02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:09.280]  now they're talking about more plots? Oh, you don't believe that? We've got more ridiculous
[02:55:09.280 --> 02:55:13.560]  plots for us. So take us out with that information today, sir.
[02:55:13.560 --> 02:55:16.920]  Much personal and factual. Go ahead. I'm sorry.
[02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:21.880]  No, no, it's just, I mean, I brought up the personal thing just, you know, on the whole
[02:55:21.880 --> 02:55:25.800]  issue of Israel, you know, a lot about it. I was wondering if you're Wikipedia.
[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:31.280]  I know Israel very well because Israel, there was two Israel's, the creation of the state
[02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:36.840]  was done so that there was refugee a place for Jews who were coming out of the camps,
[02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:43.520]  but not it literally, they wanted to base Israel. Most people have to understand Ben-Gurion
[02:55:43.520 --> 02:55:49.440]  practice law in Istanbul and Turkey. His model was Adaturk. Adaturk was very clear that
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:54.360]  he wanted a secular state with a strong military. That's really what was built. They didn't
[02:55:54.360 --> 02:55:59.560]  really care about religious Jews or the Jews in the camps, but they had in mind in the
[02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:06.160]  Zionist socialist organization was to have young Jews, people who could build the country
[02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:12.880]  and it all cost and then go to war. What Israel has never done repeatedly was one to admit
[02:56:12.880 --> 02:56:19.080]  the genocide that they officially recognized years ago against the Palestinians. There
[02:56:19.080 --> 02:56:25.240]  is no question that the Haganah and the Palma and different units of the Israeli army at
[02:56:25.240 --> 02:56:31.720]  that time have slaughtered and forced people who are now considered Palestinians out of
[02:56:31.720 --> 02:56:37.520]  the land, out of Jaffa, out of the different areas of Israel. And if Israel is a counter
[02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:43.400]  terms with anyone in the Middle East, they have to number one admit what they have done.
[02:56:43.400 --> 02:56:50.200]  Number two, come to terms that they are a nation, not a spoiled child, as Erdogan say, of America
[02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:56.000]  and continuously whining and complaining and holding on to the Dennis Rosses and the Clintons
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:01.080]  and the presidents of the United States threatening them that the Jewish vote in the United States
[02:57:01.080 --> 02:57:06.920]  will not back down. That will no longer be true. J-Star started. There are many American
[02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:11.960]  Jews and others like myself who know that Israel so well that they're really quite
[02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:16.560]  shameful. Let me ask you a question, and I want you to answer because you're an extremely
[02:57:16.560 --> 02:57:22.160]  knowledgeable man. How many Jews were in Hitler's army?
[02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:30.880]  On reportedly thousands. How many thousands? I've read a few history books, but I never
[02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:38.160]  asked. 135,000 Jews in Hitler's army. This is not my association. You have to read a
[02:57:38.160 --> 02:57:44.440]  book by Brian Riggs, R-I-G-G-S. He's a very brilliant former IDF Marine man who's a banker
[02:57:44.440 --> 02:57:49.720]  actually in Texas. He wrote a very brilliant book called The Jews, The German Jews in Hitler's
[02:57:49.720 --> 02:57:55.840]  army. This is very well documented. The number one man who was in charge of the decimation
[02:57:55.840 --> 02:58:02.800]  of Jews was Hydrik in the SS. He was a Jew. His father was a Jew. And Israel can deny
[02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:06.040]  it. They can... You're talking about the blonde beast.
[02:58:06.040 --> 02:58:11.720]  In fact, he was born in Austria. The two heads of the five field commanders, if you take
[02:58:11.720 --> 02:58:17.960]  away Guinness, and you take away Rommel, were Jews. Bloch and another both had developed
[02:58:17.960 --> 02:58:23.960]  the Blitzkrieg and the Anschluss. These were brilliant generals who were converted to Aryans.
[02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:30.480]  So the notion of the history of how Holocaust came about is totally distorted by Israel
[02:58:30.480 --> 02:58:34.040]  in favor of what Israel needed for its national security.
[02:58:34.040 --> 02:58:37.920]  Sir, we're out of time. We'll have to get back to this next time. Thank you, Steve Pacinic.
[02:58:37.920 --> 02:59:04.920]  Hopefully there's not going to be war with Iran. We'll see you back Sunday and back Monday.
