[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:16.000]  Intro
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]  There are of course those who do not want us to speak.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000]  We think, just let me think.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]  As a fact, even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000]  Damn it!
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000]  Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000]  Words are for the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]  You designed it, sir. You wanted it foolproof. You told me every television in London.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]  you now have censors and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and subverting your submissiveness.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]  Cameras. We need cameras.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]  How did this happen? Who's to blame?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]  They will be held accountable.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]  I know why you did it. I know you were afraid.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]  Who would it be? War? Terror? Disease?
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]  He promised you order. He promised you peace.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]  There is a war. It's happening now.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]  We are the resistance. We are the Infowar.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, a historic announcement today, taking the Deep State on head-on.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]  Wow. It is Tuesday, August 8th, 2023.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas at Stephen Crowder's incredible studios.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]  They have just launched a new network system partnered with Rumble.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]  His show is routinely hitting 5 million viewers a day on one channel alone.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]  This is explosive. And I'm going to start a weekly show with them.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]  And I'm going to expand into Infowars and so much more with investigative crews on the streets,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]  our reporters going all over the world.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]  This is a match made in heaven.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]  So I'm going to have Stephen Crowder and others coming up in studio.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]  Amazing comedian Nick DiPaolo and so many others.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]  We're also going to have the CEO, who's a really smart guy, of Stephen Crowder's Operation and Mug Club.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]  We're going to be having Gerald Morgan in here with us in the first hour.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]  It is going to be absolutely huge.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000]  And coming up next segment, they had an amazing hour, 15-minute press conference this morning that just ended about 35 minutes ago.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]  We're going to air about 15 minutes of that with Stephen Crowder and myself making some big announcements.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]  And then we're going to have Stephen and some of the crew.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]  Brian Kellen, who I've known for many years and one of the top comedians out there,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]  just hung out with him and Joe Rogan and had dinner on Saturday and went and saw a show on Friday in Austin.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]  He has signed up here. So have the Hodge twins and so much more.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]  And it was Stephen Crowder back when everybody turned their back on me pretty much during de-platforming
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]  other than Tucker Carlson that stood up for me.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]  And he didn't shut down during the first lockdown, the first days of that.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]  So he's the type of guy I want to work with.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]  I love the energy, the intelligence of these folks.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]  And this is a teaming up of InfoWars and Alex Jones and my crew with their crew.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]  So it is definitely exciting.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]  But remember, it's you that are the main crew.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]  When you get excited, nothing stops.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]  You tell everybody you know.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]  Tune in now to InfoWars.com forward slash show and those local AM and FM stations that are amazing picking us up
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]  and the cable and TV stations to tell folks history is happening now.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]  We have a patriot pro-America communication system.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]  We are unstoppable.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]  If we don't have that, they're going to continue to rule over this country, the deep state.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]  You saw that.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]  The intelligence agencies, the censorship, the surveillance that I told you about years ago,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]  now all admitted in Congress the last few months.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]  Humanity is striking back in the InfoWars.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]  And this is such a historic moment to be alive.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]  We're going to go to break for one minute.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]  Join a lot of radio stations and TV stations to join us at six after.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]  We're going to go to excerpts of the press conference.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000]  I beg you to think about how important your word of mouth is and you sharing the articles
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]  and sharing the videos and telling people get the forbidden truth you're not supposed to find
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]  at InfoWars.com forward slash show and getting products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]  We've got three amazing products in stock, ready to ship, sold out for almost six months.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, so incredible, so good for your whole body.

[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]  and key amino acids for your immune system and more.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]  Back in stock, discounted.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]  Silver Bullet, 30 parts per million from the top lab in the country,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]  probably by us, discounted.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]  Nitric Boost to clean out your blood and make you healthier.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]  It's in stock.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]  Rave reviews.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]  Top doctors say it's amazing.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]  And that keeps us on air.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]  Spread the word.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]  Pray for the broadcast.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]  And go now to InfoWarsStore.com and get great products that keep the tip of the spear in the fight.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]  It's Tuesday, August 8th, 2023.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]  Historic developments in the fight for free speech
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]  and the restoration of our republic, 1776, worldwide.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]  And I think the best way to lay out what's just happened
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]  is to air 15 minutes from the hour-and-a-half long incredible press conference
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]  that just ended about 35, 40 minutes ago here in North Texas
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]  at Stephen Crowder's incredible studios.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]  They plan to bring on hundreds of hosts.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  They're going to have dozens of people on air.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]  They're reaching 6, 7 million people every day.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]  This is the biggest thing out there already,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]  and it is about to explode.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]  The system fears this.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]  They're scared of this.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]  InfoWars is going anywhere.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]  This is InfoWars teaming up with Stephen Crowder
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]  and his incredible operation for reporters on the ground, investigative reports,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]  just a massive expansion in the fight against tyranny.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]  Instead of just hanging on, we are going to thrive.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]  You either thrive or you implode.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]  Well, we are going on the offense because if the globalists want to fight,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]  we're not sure how this is going to end.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]  But if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]  So we're about to air some of the press conference today.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]  Everybody should go to ladderwithcrowder.com.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]  Everybody should go there right now.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]  If people want to see the new three-hour podcast, I'm going to start every week,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]  and then it's going to expand to every day with the regular InfoWars show
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]  and so much more.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]  You should go and sign up right now at jonescrowder.com,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]  and you get a free month for all the shows with Stephen Crowder
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]  and all the other programs that are being launched and the Hodge Twins and more,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]  and then that builds the infrastructure.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]  Because imagine if instead of just a boycott,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]  $40-something billion that Anheuser-Busch lost with the Bud Light thing,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]  imagine a billion-dollar boycott.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]  Hey, folks, if $50 million comes in, this will dwarf everything.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]  This will dwarf all the other networks, Daily Wire, all of it.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]  But it's not about competition.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]  It's about the other conservative networks aren't going 20% of the way.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]  We're going all the way to bring down the new world order
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]  with tomorrow's news today.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]  So go to jonescrowder.com, jonescrowder.com,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]  and we'll put that on screen later, jonescrowder.com,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]  and that takes you right to the subpage at ladderwithcrowder.com
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]  where you get the free month.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]  They've got a bunch of other specials and a bunch of other deals there as well,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]  so be sure to take advantage of that.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]  It takes money to fight a war.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]  You want us to fight hard and go to Bilderberg and go to Bohemian Grove
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]  and go to all the other big events.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000]  You want us to go to the DNC, the RNC, Reporters on the Border.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]  You want us to go to the Davos Group.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]  We're going to do it, and this is the next level.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]  I want to salute the info warriors out there.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000]  Go to jonescrowder.com now and be the frontline patriots,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]  the first to sign up for like $7 a month to build this next-level infrastructure
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]  with Rumble that's not censoring.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]  We're already having incredible success.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]  I'm Steven Crowder.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]  Here's part of the press conference today,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]  and we'll be back with Steven Crowder and some of his other crew in studio.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:23.000]  Stay with us.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:32.000]  Have you been compromising day in and day out when no compromise is necessary?
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]  And I'll go one further.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000]  When no compromise should ever be expected from you,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000]  it is time to match intensity.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000]  Every single one of you watching or listening right now needs to flip a switch in your head
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]  where you will make those sons of bitches embarrassed
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  that they ever even thought of asking that compromise.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]  Imagine the founding fathers looking down and going,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]  what the fuck are you people doing?
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]  You're talking about the same people that rail against misinformation,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]  who platform Adam Schiff.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]  This case needs to be blown up, and the ATF needs to be held accountable.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]  Why can't we not condemn evil behavior?
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:45.000]  Of comedy specials, we have new shows, the investigative unit, which we've discussed.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]  And again, you get a free shirt at ladoscrowder.com.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]  But we have another announcement to make regarding a new acquisition here.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]  And by the way, I'll be taking your chats here after this.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]  We'll be taking some questions from the press,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]  so you can send your chats in right now on Mug Club.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]  And we'll be releasing more information regarding some of the developments.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]  But this is one that we're all pretty excited about.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]  And again, if it was just business, it wouldn't make sense.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000]  This is a man who was removed from the platforms of Apple, Spotify, Google, Facebook,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]  Meta, X, whatever the hell it is, all on the same day.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  But there's no coordination.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]  It's just coincidence.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]  And there were, by the way, many people back then who said,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]  well, that's just him. He's too extreme.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]  That's just an isolated case. It won't happen to me.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]  Well, are you paying attention now?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]  And so people who we all expect to stand in the line of fire,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]  who are supposed to be brothers in arms, tucked tail and ran.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]  They struck plea bargains with the platforms,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  who for a period of time would punish anyone who even hosted him as a guest.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]  This is the canary in the coal mine.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]  These people at these big tech platforms,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]  they tell you that they'll never come for you,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]  that you can keep your tens of millions in revenue
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]  or millions that you make from their platforms.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]  And really all that means is that if you're lucky,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]  really lucky, they'll kill you last.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]  Well, they tried to kill this next man first.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]  And if he's honest, he'll tell you they almost did.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]  They did a lot of damage.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]  But if there's one thing you can say about this man,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000]  love him or hate him,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]  is that he will fight for this country with every last breath in his body,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]  and he just won't die.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]  So it's with as much pride that I can convey,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]  and as much surprise, by the way, as you,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]  in landing this white whale, the number one draft pick,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]  without a doubt out there,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]  that for the first time he will launch his subscription network
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]  exclusively under the Mug Club umbrella,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]  starting with his new Friday show on August 18th.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]  Ladies and gentlemen...
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]  that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]  Mao took the guns.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]  Manel Castro took the guns.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]  And if you try to take our guns, 1776 will commence again!
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]  Sticking with Facebook, it is one of several companies today
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]  that are limiting the content of far-right podcasts.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]  InfoWars...
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]  Facebook, Apple, and YouTube have all taken down content from Jones
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]  and his InfoWars channel.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]  Whenever I talk about Alex Jones,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]  my wife will not let me into the house until I've been deloused.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]  Anyone who believes in Alex Jones and believes these theories,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]  you really gotta go get help.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]  Alex Jones has been ordered to pay $965 million.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]  Look how there's a move to control information.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]  There's always been.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]  And it ought to scare people,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]  but you've got a move to indoctrinate the children of America.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]  If they can get you to be part of a group,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]  an environmentalist or part of your minority group...
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]  Black, Latino, and indigenous people
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]  are suffering and dying disproportionately.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]  The most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]  is white supremacy.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]  They'll have their little tailor-made people up there
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]  that are bought and paid for
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]  to claim to be your leaders.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]  They'll have their little tailor-made people up there
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]  that are bought and paid for
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]  to claim to be your leaders.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]  They'll have their little tailor-made people up there
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]  to claim to be your leaders.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]  We're looking at a giant war in February right now.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]  Currently, that's the projection.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]  There's an entire agenda afoot
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]  to force the population to undergo
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]  different type of medical treatments,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]  namely vaccines.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]  In 2002, there was a tyrannical organization
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]  calling itself the New World Order,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]  pushing for worldwide government,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]  a cashless society.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]  If any terrorism comes, it's from this government.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]  And if there was an outside threat like Bin Laden,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]  who was a known CIS in the 80s,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]  running the Mujahideen War,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]  whose family builds all the military bases
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]  over in Saudi Arabia right now,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]  it's just from a board of Iridium Satellite.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]  He's the boogeyman they need.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]  I've been shadowbanned.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]  I've been called a liar.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]  I've been silenced on virtually every platform
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]  created by man.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]  My life has been threatened repeatedly.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]  They've tried to destroy me,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]  but I've survived.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]  And that's why I'm joining Mug Club.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]  Alex Jones, everybody!
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]  Thank you.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]  Thank you.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]  Listen, I want to thank everybody tuning in.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]  I want to thank everybody tuning in right now,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  but I want to be deadly serious here.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]  I've not been this excited ever!
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]  Yeah, Mug Club, baby, wow!
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]  So, I've known Stephen for more than 10 years.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]  Used to, you know, beg him to come on my show.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]  Always a really busy guy,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]  and he's been a bit of a popper forever.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]  But we kind of knew each other.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]  But as soon as I got deplatformed,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]  he saw as a threat and he said,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]  I want you on immediately.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]  The day after, when everybody else was running away,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]  including my friends,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]  he was like, no, this is a danger to everybody.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]  I see what this is.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]  And then again, everybody else was shutting down
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]  during the lockdown.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]  I didn't.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]  He didn't.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]  And so it's that type of instinctive courage
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]  that I really respect.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]  We've become good friends
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]  the last three or four years.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]  Since then, I love coming up here.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]  I love the energy.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]  And let's be clear,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]  InfoWars isn't going anywhere
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]  or Austin Operation,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]  my regular show that's on talk radio everywhere.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]  But we've been talking for years
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]  about some type of collaboration
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]  and he had to move from where he was
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]  to trailblaze and do this.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]  And what's incredible is it's succeeding.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000]  But here's the key.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]  We don't just have the left
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]  and the globalist and big tech
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]  and the intelligence agencies.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]  We now know that we're censoring and controlling
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]  and suppressing election information
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]  and vaccine information and open border
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]  and human trafficking information,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]  fentanyl info and Afghan withdrawal info.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]  It's the big think tanks
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]  that Crowder alluded to earlier
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]  that are so-called conservative
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]  that have billions of dollars
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]  over the last decade
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]  to buy and control
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]  the populist nationalist
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]  common sense capitalist movement
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]  that this country was founded on
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]  that met at the apple of the world's eye.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]  And so we're not just challenging the left
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]  and Hollywood and big tech.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]  We're challenging conservative Inc.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]  And they didn't make sense
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]  to some people that weren't, you know,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]  clued in or on the inside
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]  of what really goes on.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]  Six months ago,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]  when Crowder was making a big deal
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]  about the other big conservative platforms
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]  that aren't conservative,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]  they interface with YouTube and Facebook
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]  and before Twitter was sold to Musk
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]  and literally sit around in smoky rooms
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]  laughing at the conservatives.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]  And I've been around it.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]  It's disgusting to people
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]  that have authenticity
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]  like Steven Crowder and this incredible crew.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]  These are real people.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]  No, these are real people right here.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]  Gerald Morgan, all of these comedians,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]  all these people have turned down
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]  tens of millions of dollars
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]  to tell the truth.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]  I mean, there's people out there like Ted Nugent
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]  lost probably $100 million
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]  the last six, seven years
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]  supporting Trump.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]  It's been in the news.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]  Just no more stadiums, no more nothing.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]  It's over for him.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]  So there's not many people like that.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]  Probably should bring Ted Nugent over here.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]  But what I'm getting down to is
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]  we need an independent network
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]  that isn't controlled.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]  And I'm sorry, Twitter is better
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]  than some of the other so-called conservative
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]  or open platforms,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]  but it's still not even halfway free.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]  Yeah, halfway free feels better than no free.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]  And I'm not even criticizing Twitter.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]  It's just not free.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]  So many really effective people
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]  that expose communist China
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]  and certain owners of Twitter's connection to it,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]  they're all still censored,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]  but not Mug Club.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]  And I know the plan that Crowder has,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]  he's told me about it,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]  he's told you a lot about it,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]  is to literally bring on hundreds of providers
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]  and I guess the long-term even thousands
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]  and then use the great folks at Rumble
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]  that really are free and open
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]  to energize this.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]  So people always say,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]  hey, if you want your own internet,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]  why don't you build it?
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]  Or you want your own platform, build it.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]  Well, it's very hard to do,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]  but he's been able to do it
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]  because of you, the Mug Club members.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]  And that gives him that independence.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]  So you literally aren't just the tail of the dog,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]  you're the whole shoot match.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]  You're the whole dog, the teeth, the brain,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]  the feet, the guts, the heart,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]  the brain, the eyes and ears
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]  with the investigative unit and everything.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]  You are this operation.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]  And if you get excited about this,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]  it's game over for the new world order.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]  Listen, we came and founded a new country
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]  to get away from tyranny.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]  We weren't perfect,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]  but it became the freest, greatest thing ever.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]  So it's that the Israelites left Egypt
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]  under Rameses II
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]  and they've now dug up all the tablets
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]  and the history and that's a true story.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]  It really happened.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]  It's on the Egyptian hieroglyphs as well.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]  So Stephen Crowder and the Mug Club
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]  and this whole operation
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]  is literally leading everybody out of Egypt
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]  and we don't have to wait 50 years or 40 years
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]  to cross the river Jordan, folks.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]  We're doing it right now.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]  It's already launched, out of the gate, successful.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]  That is a true American success story
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]  of dedication, work, not backing down
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]  and it challenges the entire system.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]  So when this is successful, and it already is,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]  but I mean super successful,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]  it will then be the example
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]  to all the other big so-called conservative
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]  populist talk show hosts
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]  who don't like serving the globalists
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]  but are too scared to buck them
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]  to let them then have the courage to follow us.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]  So this is true leadership and history
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]  that you're watching right now today.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]  Now here's another key point.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]  If you look at the 40 plus billion
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]  that Anheuser-Busch has lost
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]  with the entire debacle with Bud Light,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]  that's a great example of us saying
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]  we're gonna withdraw support of people
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]  targeting children and sexualization
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]  and this whole transhumanist movement.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]  That's what it is.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]  You all know Harari at the WF says,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]  oh this is just the beginning.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000]  If you'll accept two men having a baby,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]  you'll accept cyborgs, all the rest of it.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]  Clones, animal-human hybrids,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]  which is all out in the open now.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]  But instead of just boycotts,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]  what about buycotts?
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]  And that's what this is, folks.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]  You get all these great shows,
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]  all these great memberships,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]  all these great things
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]  and know that you're part of history
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]  bucking the system,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]  American Revolution, 1776, Worldwide 2.0.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]  So the boycotts are great.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]  Pull your money out of the globalist system,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]  but then spend it with the institutions
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]  and organizations that are standing for freedom.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]  If Anheuser-Busch just lost,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]  I think the number I saw last week
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]  was 41 billion.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000]  It just keeps going up and up.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]  25% market share in all of their products.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]  Think about what would happen
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]  if people spent a billion on Mug Club
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]  instead of 10 million or whatever.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]  Because this guy's putting
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]  almost everything back into the operation.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]  Because it is about the excitement
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]  of standing up for liberty
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]  and connecting to our forefathers
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]  and foremothers that created this country.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]  And that's what this is about.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000]  Stephen kept saying,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]  it doesn't make business sense
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]  to not roll over
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]  and make the hundreds of millions
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]  and solve the system.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]  But wait, if the whole country
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]  and the world's gone,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]  that money doesn't matter.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]  It makes perfect business sense.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]  Because our business is prosperity
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]  and freedom and justice
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]  and Americana, 1776, Worldwide.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]  So that's what this is all about.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]  So we've been talking for six months
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000]  about doing this.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]  And I said, well,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]  I'm going to keep InfoWars going,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]  the great group we do.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]  And they thought,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000]  and I said, what's your idea?
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000]  And I had my idea already written down.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]  They said, a once a week show,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000]  build off that,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]  then start building some other shows.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000]  And with the funding we get from this,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]  we'll be able to hire back more reporters,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]  do more investigative stuff on the ground
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]  at the border and at Bilderberg
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]  and at Davos and at the RNC and DNC.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]  So this is a match made in heaven.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]  Everybody needs to tell your friends,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]  your family, your neighbors,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]  hey, you want a second American Revolution?
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]  You don't like what's happening?
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]  Well, this is the group,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]  this is the organization
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]  that is the best there is.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]  We're not up here saying,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000]  you know, we're Superman.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000]  We're not up here saying
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]  we have all the answers.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]  You know what?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]  It's not bragging when it's fact.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]  People need to recognize
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000]  that this operation,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]  what Steven Crowder and his crew are doing,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]  is the best, open, freest,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]  biggest thing there is in the world
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]  in opposition to the New World Order.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]  And hey, you tune into my show,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]  you're going to get hardcore analysis
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]  and over-the-horizon information
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000]  on what the globalists are planning next.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]  That's all it is.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]  Study it.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]  It's hardcore.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]  Don't slit your wrist after you watch it.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000]  But the good thing is,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]  you can then tune in
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]  to the incredible, amazing,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]  better than the nighttime comedy shows,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]  live delivery of these guys,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]  and they make it fun.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]  And that's why I like the energy here.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]  It's quite frankly,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]  InfoWars, great crew, great people,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]  but it's like you are in a bunker.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]  We've been doing it 20-something years,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]  and it's crazy.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]  So it's a breath of fresh air
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000]  to just add this family
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]  to what's happening,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]  to be part of this organization,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]  and to have the InfoWars crew.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]  Now you're becoming part of this organization.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]  I'm just blessed and honored.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]  It's incredible.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]  And at 11 a.m.,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]  just coming up in about an hour from now,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]  I'll do my live show
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]  out of the classic Steven Crowder studios.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]  We're going to have these guys in here with us.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]  It's so exciting.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]  So 11 a.m. Central,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]  InfoWars.com, forward slash show,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]  and band out video.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]  But I want everybody watching,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000]  that means on InfoWars everywhere,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]  to be part of this revolutionary act.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000]  You want resistance?
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000]  You want somebody to stand up?
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]  You want somebody to fight?
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]  Go now to the Mug Club.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]  Go now, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]  and use the promo codes that are there
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]  to get a month off.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]  Do it now.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]  Go to Mug Club.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000]  Take action.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]  Because the globalists want war.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]  They want to destroy us.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]  Well, guess what?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]  We didn't start this fight.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]  We don't want it.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]  But if you want to fight,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]  you better believe you've got one.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]  Well, the system's definitely scared of this.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]  And I've known Steven Crowder for 10 years.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]  I'm going to talk about it later in the next segment.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]  It's a short segment left here.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]  Only about four or five minutes left.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]  But this is really next level.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]  You want somebody to fight, folks?
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]  This is it.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]  And, of course, the great Ryan Callen
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]  had to leave and catch an airplane.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]  He'll be back soon.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]  But Nick DiPaolo, again, who Joe Rogan says
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000]  is one of the top comics in the world,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]  which he is,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]  the original OG is here with us.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]  And, of course, we have the CEO of
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]  Liner with Crowder,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]  who is just a really good talk show.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]  He's a smart guy and a wonderful person
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]  and a family man.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]  Of course, we have Mr. Morgan,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]  Joe Morgan here.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]  And without introduction,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]  we have Steven Crowder.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]  So, Steven, only four minutes to break.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]  I'm getting butterflies,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]  which I don't ever get anymore.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]  This is big, what you're doing.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]  Well, I do, just watching you speak there.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]  I mean, I saw Nick when you were speaking.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]  It looked like he was ready to hit somebody
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000]  just for the sake of this.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000]  I read this, coach.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]  Oh, yeah.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]  It was great.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000]  But, no, this is...
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000]  Look, we couldn't be more excited
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]  about having you here and you're doing this,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000]  you know, that you're going to be doing
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]  the Friday show.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]  People out there are getting fatigued
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]  with a tip here and a patron there
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]  and a tip jar here.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]  We want to have a network where creators
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]  can control their content,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000]  have their subscribers,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]  not be beholden to corporate overlords
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000]  or the conservative patsies
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]  who do their bidding.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]  And so that's where this is.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]  I don't think there's ever been...
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]  I mean, you're the number one draft pick.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]  You know, so getting you involved with it
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]  means to me it's a stamp of approval
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000]  that we're offering something
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]  that no one else is.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]  I can't tell you how excited we are
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]  and honestly how moved Gerald and I were
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]  that, you know, that you wanted to be there.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]  We were going,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]  do you think Alex would want to do something with us?
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]  Because he doesn't really need anybody.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]  And here we are.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000]  Well, you're the Pat Brady
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]  20 years ago.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]  And I'm kind of like the Roger Stallback
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]  right before I retired.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000]  But the point is,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]  you're not scared.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]  And everybody else ran.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000]  Everybody else ran.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000]  And you supported me.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]  We were already friends,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]  but not really close friends.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000]  But under the pressure,
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000]  like you said today,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000]  that brought us together.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000]  I didn't even...
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000]  Like, we were friends.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000]  I didn't even like you that much.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]  I don't mean I disliked you.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]  I didn't know you that well.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000]  Well, never mind when you disagree with me.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000]  A lot of times you were right.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000]  Oh, yeah.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000]  But no, but I didn't even...
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]  But I didn't know you that well.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]  And I was going,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000]  wait a second, wait a second.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]  This guy has some of the most powerful people
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000]  And then none of them are saying anything.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]  I felt compelled to have you on immediately.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]  And we knew we would be suspended.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]  But that's something we also talked about,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]  is you weren't allowed to be a guest.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000]  And then they changed it and said,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000]  okay, he can be a guest.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]  He just can't host.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000]  And so then we had you host.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000]  And of course, we were suspended
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000]  because I think it's funny.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000]  No, you're right.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]  At first, four years ago,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]  I couldn't go on any shows
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000]  until you did that.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000]  Well, and that's because
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000]  being the biggest channel there
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]  on YouTube,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000]  conservative channel that exists
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000]  on YouTube there,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000]  banning our channel
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]  is tantamount to saying
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]  no conservatives are welcome.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]  So that's one thing
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]  that Mug Club really allows us to do.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000]  And we're able to operate
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]  within the systems
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]  without being beholden to them
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000]  because we don't make a dime on ads.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]  So if they suspend us,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]  we go, all right, fine.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000]  We'll be gone for two weeks.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000]  But you know what?
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]  It's worth the risk to have Alex on
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]  because people need to see this.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]  Well, the bottom line is
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]  Elon Musk has jumped on this
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]  the last six months.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]  More power to him.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]  But he's like,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]  he's like the diet version.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]  You guys are really doing it.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000]  You've proven it.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]  And once we do this,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]  once we build a conservative
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]  populist economy,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000]  it's game over.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000]  Yeah.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000]  No, you're exactly right.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000]  It's voting with your dollar.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]  And, you know, people,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]  I think there's your promo code
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000]  is Alex right now.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000]  And people get a month free.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000]  Are they signing up?
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]  Where is it, Joe,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]  that they're signing up for?
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]  They go to the main mug club
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000]  and do it with Alex
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]  or they can go
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]  to make it even easier
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000]  to jonescrowder.com
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]  that redirects them
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]  right to the sub page.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000]  OK.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000]  Yeah.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]  Great.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000]  And I'm really excited
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]  to see what you're doing there
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]  on Friday and see,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000]  you know,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000]  what else you bring over.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]  You know,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]  we're always have to tease
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000]  some information out there.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]  But look,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000]  this is the only way
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000]  I know how to do things.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000]  I don't know how to do it
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000]  any other way.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]  If we're going to fail,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]  here's the thing.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000]  People,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000]  people ask people
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000]  ask what they can do.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000]  OK, great.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]  Don't just boycott,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000]  you know,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000]  Anheuser-Busch
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000]  or Bud Light.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]  Boycott.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000]  This real simple.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]  Everyone should go
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]  to jonescrowder.com.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000]  Everybody should go there.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000]  Use promo code Alex.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]  Everybody should get
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]  the free month.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000]  This is a revolution
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000]  and the infrastructure
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000]  we're going to come back
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000]  from break.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]  But all the stuff
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]  you're launching,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000]  we're not against
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000]  project purchase.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]  Like I said,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]  we love them,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]  but you're going to do that.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]  You've already been doing it
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]  for years.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]  Yeah, well,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000]  what we have is,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]  again,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]  Mug Club is self-sustaining.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]  It's a business,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000]  but it's not just business.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000]  I hear that all the time.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]  Like, hey,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000]  it's just business.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000]  And that's why people
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]  don't really launch
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]  when they have hundreds
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]  of millions of dollars.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]  Their own investigative
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000]  journalists,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]  journalist units.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]  It's why they don't
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]  bring on people
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]  like Alex Jones,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000]  like Nick DiPaolo,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000]  who are the OGs,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]  who are respected
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]  by their peers,
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000]  but they're seen
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000]  as a liability
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]  because they truly
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000]  are free speech oriented.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000]  Don't be fooled
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000]  and that's why
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000]  everything's an info war.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]  So the enemy
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]  spends billions

[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:05.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:16.010]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:24.010]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:33.010]  Hi, we're back live here at the Stephen Crowder Mug Club Studios, somewhere deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:40.010]  And I want to just say something very clearly to viewers and listeners.
[00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:43.010]  I don't hype things that aren't real.
[00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:44.010]  Okay, everybody knows that.
[00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:47.010]  I don't just say things just to hype them like all these bozos.
[00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:54.010]  When I say what Stephen Crowder and Gerald Morgan and his crew are doing is game-changing, it is.
[00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:57.010]  What Rumble's doing is game-changing.
[00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:03.010]  It is getting massive percentages of global video traffic and exponentially growing.
[00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:04.010]  It's at 6%.
[00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:05.010]  Sounds small.
[00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:08.010]  Nobody can even crack half a percent compared to YouTube.
[00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:10.010]  At current trend rates in a year, it'll be at 20%.
[00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:12.010]  The system is very, very scared.
[00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:16.010]  Stephen's getting 3, 4, 5 million views a day just on his show there.
[00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:20.010]  He's adding all these new shows and putting it all back into infrastructure.
[00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:25.010]  The left is good at massive donations and big corporate funding and ESGs.
[00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:28.010]  And that's why they win even though they're culturally unpopular.
[00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:33.010]  If people simply, instead of boycotting 41 million of Anheuser-Busch, I'd say more power to you.
[00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:40.010]  Again, if you just spent money on things like memberships at jonescrowder.com to get a free month on not just Stephen's show
[00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:43.010]  but all the other shows, the new Friday show I'm going to do that's podcast three hours.
[00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:47.010]  Very soon, it'll expand to weekly, not just a weekly show but a daily show.
[00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:50.010]  Got big plans here, but it's like filled with dreams.
[00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:51.010]  If we build it, they will come.
[00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:52.010]  We have built it.
[00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:53.010]  It's very exciting.
[00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:55.010]  This is dangerous to the globalists.
[00:34:55.010 --> 00:35:00.010]  So, Stephen Crowder, break this down and also jump in anytime you want, Nick.
[00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:04.010]  Yeah, well, I mean, we just did the, I guess, the replatforming press conference.
[00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:08.010]  And look, replatforming, it's a term that really does hold a lot of meaning for us.
[00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:11.010]  I mean, beforehand, I talked about you like you're like a battered housewife.
[00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:13.010]  You get removed by all of the platforms in one day.
[00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:17.010]  And no one really talked about this is clearly not coincidence.
[00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:18.010]  It's clearly not coincidence.
[00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:20.010]  No one called them to the mat like, wait a second.
[00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:22.010]  You all clearly had – this isn't a conspiracy.
[00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:25.010]  You all clearly got on the phone, ring, ring, we'll get rid of Alex.
[00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:27.010]  And Tim Cook said it was.
[00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.010]  He said they all met.
[00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:29.010]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:33.010]  We know that they did, but there was no place for – so you had to do what you do now,
[00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:35.010]  which is closed circuit and you still have a massive audience.
[00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:40.010]  But there needs to be some restitution where you can also get back in and build a new audience.
[00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:41.010]  And that just wasn't available.
[00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:42.010]  Rumble is now making that available.
[00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:46.010]  And so when we look to people, we say we want to expand Mug Club, right?
[00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:49.010]  And the easiest thing would be to take my ball and go home and write out the contract.
[00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:51.010]  But we're saying, okay, who needs to be replatformed?
[00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:52.010]  Who are the voices that need to be heard?
[00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:54.010]  You were at the top of the list and in comedy.
[00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:58.010]  And people know, ever since I've been having Nick just on the show as a guest back in my den,
[00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:00.010]  I was the funniest man alive.
[00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:01.010]  That's what I've always called him.
[00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:04.010]  And by the way, stand-up comics will tell you that.
[00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.010]  And this is a guy who – he had to forfeit.
[00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:10.010]  I mean, the SiriusXM, the tweets that you put out there that got you –
[00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:13.010]  it's still one of the funniest I've ever read in my life.
[00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:15.010]  I thought it was kind of mild, actually.
[00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:17.010]  It wasn't that bad, but it was funny.
[00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:19.010]  What about the Walmart Plano shooting?
[00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.010]  I don't remember that tweet.
[00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:25.010]  Nor do I remember the shooting.
[00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:26.010]  I don't either.
[00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.010]  No, they all sort of bleed together.
[00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:29.010]  It's an active shooter.
[00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:33.010]  And I said it's the first time anybody's in Walmart that had considered an active lifestyle.
[00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:38.010]  And that one got a little – my fans are going, ah, that's too early.
[00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:39.010]  I go, that's when it's funny.
[00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:41.010]  It's not funny a year from now.
[00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:42.010]  Exactly.
[00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:43.010]  Free speech is what's uncomfortable.
[00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:44.010]  Yeah.
[00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:45.010]  Thank you.
[00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:46.010]  Well, especially with comedy, right?
[00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:48.010]  I don't know if it was Phyllis Diller who said it's a rubber-tipped sword.
[00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:50.010]  It's a way to make a point without drawing blood.
[00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:52.010]  If you can laugh about something, you can process it.
[00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:54.010]  And often we're condemned for that.
[00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:55.010]  Wait a minute.
[00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:57.010]  Well, they say a jester was the second most powerful person in the kingdom.
[00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:01.010]  Well, especially if it was Danny Kaye because he was servicing the king here on radio,
[00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:02.010]  fellating.
[00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:05.010]  Danny Kaye was Kaye.
[00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:06.010]  I love how –
[00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:07.010]  Is that it?
[00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.010]  We're pushing this rebel network and he quotes Phyllis Diller.
[00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:10.010]  Yes, I know.
[00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:12.010]  And then I have a Danny Kaye reference.
[00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:14.010]  I had to reach back for that.
[00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:15.010]  Another glass of coffee?
[00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:16.010]  Yeah.
[00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:17.010]  Wasn't he playing doctor with Rock Hudson?
[00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:19.010]  Was that Danny Kaye?
[00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:20.010]  I don't know.
[00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:24.010]  The lineup you've already got, it's obviously going to explode and it's already dwarfing.
[00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.010]  And I'm not against the other conservative networks, but they're –
[00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:28.010]  Not at all.
[00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:30.010]  They're following the orders of YouTube and Facebook on record.
[00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:32.010]  And that's what you exposed six months ago.
[00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:33.010]  That's a big deal.
[00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:37.010]  The conservative, basically, is just playing patty cake with the system.
[00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:40.010]  Look, it's fine if you want to make tens of millions of dollars off of YouTube ad revenue
[00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:41.010]  if you want to.
[00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:44.010]  But there needs to be some alternative, at least one alternative where some people say,
[00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:45.010]  you know what?
[00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:46.010]  We're not going to be beholden to that.
[00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:47.010]  And we want to save the country.
[00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:48.010]  Yes.
[00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.010]  Exactly.
[00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:51.010]  Now, there's a place for all different kinds of soldiers.
[00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:53.010]  Some people operate exclusively within those.
[00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:56.010]  Now, to be clear, we still operate within those systems like we're on YouTube, but
[00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:57.010]  we're not monetized.
[00:37:57.010 --> 00:38:01.010]  There's a huge difference in the threshold of being allowed on YouTube versus being advertised
[00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:02.010]  as friendly.
[00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:03.010]  Yeah, you haven't sold out.
[00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:04.010]  Yeah.
[00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:05.010]  And we get suspended all the time, all the time.
[00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:08.010]  Now, that's fine if people want to do it, but there needs to be at least one place where
[00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:12.010]  people don't care, where people say, no, we're not going to chase that ad revenue because
[00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:15.010]  we are supported by people who want this mug club.
[00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:18.010]  I had a conversation with a guy, actually, at an Airbnb.
[00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:19.010]  This just happened recently.
[00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:22.010]  And he said, I left something there, actually.
[00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:23.010]  He said, hey, let me give it to you.
[00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:24.010]  You need to come pick it up.
[00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:25.010]  I said, oh, wait, you're...
[00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:26.010]  He knew who I was.
[00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:29.010]  And he said, you know, I work at X right here in Texas.
[00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:30.010]  He said...
[00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.010]  Not the former Twitter company.
[00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:32.010]  No, no, not Twitter.
[00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:33.010]  But he said, I work at XYZ.
[00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:34.010]  He said, you know what?
[00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:38.010]  I have stuff that I want to say, but I know that if I put it out there, I'm going to get
[00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:39.010]  fired.
[00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:41.010]  And I said, see, that's the thing is we say it so that you...
[00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:43.010]  I don't want you to get fired.
[00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:46.010]  But when you support us, when you join Mug Club, we better say it, right?
[00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:48.010]  We're taking that arrow so that you don't have to.
[00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:53.010]  And if we say, hey, we're going to represent your voice, but instead say, actually, we
[00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:55.010]  need this 20 million in revenue from YouTube.
[00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:58.010]  So we're not really going to say the things you're afraid to say and get fired.
[00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:59.010]  Then we're a seller.
[00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:00.010]  That's a betrayal.
[00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:02.010]  So we need to kill the chilling effect.
[00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:03.010]  Yes.
[00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.010]  Yeah, we absolutely do.
[00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:05.010]  And the lineup you were talking about, we have our show.
[00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:09.010]  Obviously, there's a lot of people who don't know, who aren't members yet, a full hour
[00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:10.010]  of additional show, a Friday show.
[00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:12.010]  Nick DiPaolo is on Monday through Thursday.
[00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:13.010]  And I can't record...
[00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:16.010]  If you want someone to talk about unfiltered and funny, 5 p.m. Eastern.
[00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.010]  Now we're adding Brian Callen every week.
[00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:19.010]  We're adding Hodge Twins every week.
[00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:21.010]  We're adding you every Friday, starting this next week.
[00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:23.010]  We have an investigative journalism unit.
[00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:25.010]  We're going to be adding animated series, right?
[00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:26.010]  This is being built from the ground up.
[00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:31.010]  So it's a process, but it's responsive to what Mug Club wants.
[00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:34.010]  And you've proven and I've proven we actually do what we say we're going to do.
[00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:36.010]  And again, very soon, I'll just be point blank with folks.
[00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:38.010]  I'm still geared towards syndicated radio.
[00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:39.010]  That's what kept us on air.
[00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:40.010]  We'll probably do three hours a day.
[00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:44.010]  Then fourth hour, commercial three very soon on the Mug Club.
[00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.010]  And then we're going to add...
[00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:48.010]  A lot of folks will live in Austin, not in Dallas.
[00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:49.010]  We'll add more shows there.
[00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:50.010]  It's a match made in heaven.
[00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:52.010]  Yeah, it's whatever it is that you want to do.
[00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:53.010]  Like, it really is.
[00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:54.010]  It's a blank canvas.
[00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:55.010]  And yeah, look, the media landscape is changing.
[00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:58.010]  And one thing I will say, look, I've talked to some people out there.
[00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:00.010]  And I know that, okay, Tucker Carlson, for example, is a free agent.
[00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:03.010]  And I've only had good interactions with Tucker personally.
[00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:06.010]  But there aren't many people who do what you do or do what Nick does.
[00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:08.010]  That's a very different skill set.
[00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:10.010]  Tucker Carlson has a monologue that he would do for 10, 15 minutes.
[00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:11.010]  Great.
[00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:14.010]  And then, you know, at Fox News, you have 20, 30 writers, producers.
[00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:18.010]  You sit there without a net, live, for three hours every day.
[00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:21.010]  And Nick DiPaolo has done that for a long time, broadcasting.
[00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:22.010]  That is a different skill set.
[00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:25.010]  And by the way, it's one that the left is terrified.
[00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:27.010]  Now everything is going towards short snippets, short snippets.
[00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:28.010]  You know why?
[00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:30.010]  Because there isn't the same buy-in when it's just an algorithm.
[00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.010]  They can control what you see and you're not a fan.
[00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:33.010]  They're scared of the long form.
[00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:34.010]  They're scared of the written word.
[00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:36.010]  Don't you love being the counterculture, though?
[00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:38.010]  I love being the rebel.
[00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:39.010]  Yeah.
[00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:40.010]  You know who you put together?
[00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:41.010]  The Oakland Raiders of the 70s.
[00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:42.010]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:43.010]  That's who we are.
[00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:44.010]  Yeah.
[00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:45.010]  John Madden.
[00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:46.010]  There's John Madden.
[00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:48.010]  And a bunch of guys that nobody wanted.
[00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:50.010]  They kind of had big balls.
[00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:51.010]  It ends up winning.
[00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:52.010]  It ends up winning.
[00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:53.010]  Just winning.
[00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:54.010]  That's how I look at it.
[00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:55.010]  Well, Oakland Raiders is a perfect analogy.
[00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:56.010]  Yeah.
[00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:57.010]  Right.
[00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:01.010]  Also, like, Outlaw Country, they were kicked out of Nashville for admitting they smoked dope.
[00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:04.010]  And then, like, five years later, they were 80% of the market.
[00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:05.010]  I mean, that's what's happened.
[00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:06.010]  There you go.
[00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:07.010]  Well, and it's twofold, right?
[00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:11.010]  So we're serving the audience, and the audience needs to get better access to content so they
[00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:13.010]  don't have, like you said, the tip fatigue where they're paying for this.
[00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:17.010]  It's like your Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, all these different subscriptions that you have.
[00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:21.010]  But it's also creators need contracts that allow them to be who they are.
[00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:25.010]  Like, if I had come down and started talking to you about a contract that makes Alex Jones
[00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:28.010]  not Alex Jones, you'd have been like, I don't care how much money you offer.
[00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:29.010]  I'm not interested, right?
[00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:34.010]  So this was about how do we structure something that allows content creators to go out there
[00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.010]  and serve their audience as they see fit.
[00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.010]  Right.
[00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:39.010]  That's the big difference in what we're doing.
[00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:43.010]  And we're not trying to start a network where we just buy you and bring you over here and
[00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:46.010]  control what you say to make sure we make enough money and profit off of this.
[00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:52.010]  For us, this is about making a change in this country and helping people be equipped to
[00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:53.010]  battle daily.
[00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:57.010]  And, Gerald, not everybody's the CEO of, like, the number one independent conservative media
[00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.010]  company, even bigger than the liberal companies.
[00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:00.010]  You're freaking me out a little bit.
[00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:01.010]  No, no, talk to me.
[00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:02.010]  No, the listeners are great.
[00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:06.010]  But I need to get this too.
[00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:10.010]  Understand, folks, all the other contracts, whether it's with big tech or the other conservative
[00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:12.010]  outfits, they control you.
[00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:15.010]  They say you have to abide by these strictures.
[00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:16.010]  So it's rigged.
[00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:18.010]  But what you guys have set up is revolutionary.
[00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:22.010]  This is the only place with a platform that can handle the mass of traffic and where you
[00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:23.010]  can say and do whatever you want.
[00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:24.010]  That's Americana.
[00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:25.010]  That threatens the system.
[00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:27.010]  And it is catching on.
[00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:28.010]  It will catch on.
[00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:30.010]  That's why this is such a big deal.
[00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:33.010]  It's not just we're going to have some funny conservative shows and break some news.
[00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:35.010]  No, folks, this is building the infrastructure.
[00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:36.010]  This is what the enemy fears.
[00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:37.010]  So elaborate on that.
[00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:38.010]  Yeah.
[00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:39.010]  So, I mean, think about it right now.
[00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:40.010]  If you're...
[00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:41.010]  And Rumble's a great place.
[00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:42.010]  Before Rumble, we really didn't have a lot of options.
[00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:45.010]  We were trying to get our show out somewhere to make sure if we did get banned.
[00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:48.010]  I mean, you know all about that, trying to make sure that it doesn't get banned everywhere.
[00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:52.010]  Right now, with Rumble, the way that it was, there were islands.
[00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:54.010]  And that's great because you have some really big islands.
[00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:57.010]  You have some big, talented people out there that were trying to do their show.
[00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:58.010]  But they're isolated.
[00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:59.010]  And make some noise.
[00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:00.010]  They're isolated.
[00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.010]  And so what Rumble saw based on our conversations with them after we were like,
[00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:07.010]  Hey, guys, we've got to do something different, was we can allow creators to form networks.
[00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:09.010]  We don't need to be fractured and isolated.
[00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:11.010]  That's exactly what the Dems want.
[00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:12.010]  That's what liberals want.
[00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:13.010]  They don't want you to be effective.
[00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:15.010]  They want you to think you're being effective.
[00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:16.010]  Right.
[00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.010]  Right.
[00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:18.010]  And if you've built an audience for yourself and you're out there thinking,
[00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:20.010]  Okay, I'm just making all the money for myself.
[00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:21.010]  Fantastic.
[00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:22.010]  Maybe that works a little bit.
[00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.010]  But guess what?
[00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:28.010]  If we bind together and jump on the same island, you can't stop that.
[00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:32.010]  We'll get access to the content that you can produce and that Stephen can produce.
[00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:34.010]  And Brian and Nick.
[00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.010]  And we save the country and the world.
[00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:37.010]  Let me put a finer point on it.
[00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:39.010]  And that was a great job from Jill.
[00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:41.010]  But, for example, right now people have a choice.
[00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:44.010]  It's okay to want to do my own thing, closed circuit, or I have my subscribers.
[00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:45.010]  I get 100% of the revenue.
[00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:49.010]  But I don't benefit from a big network, the exposure.
[00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:52.010]  And if you go to one of these networks, you lose your right to your content.
[00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:55.010]  But other than ESG to interrupt, they're going to shut down the banking as they've already tried.
[00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:56.010]  Right.
[00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:58.010]  Everybody thinks they're on their own reservation.
[00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:59.010]  No, no, no.
[00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:00.010]  They're going to eat you last.
[00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:04.010]  We literally today had to change some of the credit card processing because we were like,
[00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:05.010]  Oh, wait a second.
[00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:06.010]  They hate Alex.
[00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:07.010]  True.
[00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:08.010]  So we made sure that all of that is secure.
[00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:12.010]  I mean, nothing against the guy who started Brexit, Nigel Farage.
[00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:15.010]  But that was an international story where they took his banking.
[00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:16.010]  You take yours.
[00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:17.010]  You're like, Yeah, we're just getting.
[00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:18.010]  We just got over it.
[00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:19.010]  Same thing with me.
[00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:21.010]  But the problem out there is people have a choice.
[00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:23.010]  Okay, do I make a living by myself on an island?
[00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:25.010]  Or do I give everything up to go to a network?
[00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:28.010]  Look, anyone out there who if you're doing your own thing, you're on an island, right?
[00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:30.010]  You have your own pay service to Patreon.
[00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:32.010]  Look, talk with Gerald.
[00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:36.010]  Guarantee you, if you compare the numbers, you will make more at Mug Club and you don't
[00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:40.010]  give anything up and you benefit from Alex, myself, Nick, and more.
[00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:41.010]  Think about this for a second.
[00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:43.010]  This is one thing when Gerald and I realized we were on to something.
[00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:45.010]  And I hate talking about this because I sound so selfish.
[00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:46.010]  No, but this revolution.
[00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:47.010]  No, you are.
[00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:49.010]  But this is what you invented.
[00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:50.010]  The wheel.
[00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:51.010]  Well, I was about to do it.
[00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:52.010]  And now I'm going to say it.
[00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:53.010]  I'm not going to say it.
[00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:56.010]  So when we were dealing with sponsors back in the day, right?
[00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:57.010]  We were on YouTube.
[00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:01.010]  And all of a sudden sponsors were wanting to pay just for Mug Club because they go,
[00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:02.010]  wait, wait a second.
[00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:03.010]  How many people are tuning in?
[00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:04.010]  How many tens of thousands?
[00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:08.010]  How many people are tuning in basically who are poor subscribers?
[00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:13.010]  And that space became valuable advertising space because so many that's unheard of.
[00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:17.010]  Hitting the tip jar because you want to see someone do well is very different from creating
[00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:19.010]  content that people want to tune into every day.
[00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:21.010]  And that's why we want to provide value.
[00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:26.010]  This is all about giving the people power who already want freedom and justice and populism
[00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:28.010]  and conservatism and Christianity.
[00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:30.010]  So all we're doing is saying, here's what you want.
[00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:31.010]  Make it big.
[00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:32.010]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:33.010]  And you mentioned this on the show.
[00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:35.010]  Instead of just doing the boycott, we need to do a boycott.
[00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:37.010]  That works really, really well with Chick-fil-A.
[00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:41.010]  Now, I know they've since made some steps that we don't agree with, but at the time
[00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:42.010]  they were packed.
[00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:45.010]  The very next day after that, they were packed with people.
[00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:46.010]  I went there.
[00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:48.010]  They doubled their market share off that.
[00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:51.010]  And they're just saying, we were off on Sunday and we're not commies.
[00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:52.010]  We're saying we're battling the commies.
[00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:56.010]  Yeah, well, they were fighting some, I think there was a gay guy in the drive-thru or something
[00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.010]  like that that was giving them crap and the video went out.
[00:45:58.010 --> 00:46:00.010]  And then we went and supported them.
[00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:05.010]  Imagine if conservatives did that on a daily basis with content that they love, with businesses
[00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:07.010]  that they love that hold their values.
[00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:09.010]  There are those companies out there.
[00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:10.010]  It just takes a minute to find them.
[00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.010]  And as soon as you do, it's like, fine.
[00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:13.010]  I think Yingling, right?
[00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:15.010]  That was one that really capitalized off of it.
[00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:16.010]  Yeah, they stepped right in on it.
[00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:17.010]  They did.
[00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:18.010]  But you know what, though?
[00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:19.010]  Here's the thing, too.
[00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:20.010]  Here's a perfect example, Yingling.
[00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:21.010]  And I'm not going to name names.
[00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:22.010]  Yingling has been around.
[00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:24.010]  They've always just been a brewery, one of the oldest breweries.
[00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:26.010]  They happen to be conservative.
[00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:29.010]  But when the Bud Light thing happened, how many people came out going, we're America's
[00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:30.010]  beer.
[00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:31.010]  And they're selling a six-pack for $40.
[00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:33.010]  That's using you to make money.
[00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:35.010]  That's not creating a product that you want.
[00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:36.010]  Yingling is a product that people want.
[00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:37.010]  And those people are patriots.
[00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:38.010]  That's the difference.
[00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:39.010]  Well, it's simple.
[00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:42.010]  If people support this, we'll change the world and beat them.
[00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:43.010]  They're scared of my broadcast.
[00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:44.010]  They're scared of yours.
[00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:45.010]  We're not whiners.
[00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.010]  Oh, they took our banks.
[00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:49.010]  We probably should be bigger whiners going, hey, we're under attack.
[00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:51.010]  But they're literally scared of this.
[00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:55.010]  But getting to Nick, I know you don't want to give away your great comedy just here on
[00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:56.010]  the main broadcast.
[00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:58.010]  That's your show that you do every day, coming up this afternoon.
[00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:59.010]  Tell us about it.
[00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:03.010]  But some of the politically incorrect stuff, give it to us right now for my audience.
[00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.010]  Yeah, just don't be put on the spot.
[00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:08.010]  Or what are some of the jokes you got in trouble for?
[00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:10.010]  Obama, when Obama was in office.
[00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:12.010]  Remember when they threw shoes at George Bush?
[00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:13.010]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:14.010]  He dodged it.
[00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:15.010]  Pretty quick.
[00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.010]  He dodged it when Obama was president.
[00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:21.010]  I would do these jokes, by the way, at the Comedy Cellar in New York, which is on the
[00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:26.010]  fucking campus, which is on the campus of NYU.
[00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:27.010]  It's on the fucking campus.
[00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:29.010]  It's on the campus of NYU.
[00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:31.010]  And it's all liberals in the audience.
[00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:33.010]  I came out right after the Bush incident.
[00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:36.010]  I said, you know, I don't agree with anything Obama has to say.
[00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:40.010]  But I would never throw a shoe at his head unless it needed shining.
[00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:44.010]  And again, just, come on.
[00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:46.010]  I know Obama's a dick.
[00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:49.010]  You were telling me last night at the dinner how you open your show now.
[00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:55.010]  I open my show, I come out, the last couple of months I go, how many people here hope
[00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:59.010]  Nancy Pelosi has been using Roundup in her garden for 10 years?
[00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:00.010]  I do.
[00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:03.010]  There's no fat on that joke.
[00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:06.010]  It's just a funny way of saying I hope she gets cancer, which she doesn't actually.
[00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:07.010]  Maybe he does.
[00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:09.010]  Think about it.
[00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:10.010]  There's a huge difference.
[00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:11.010]  Nancy Pelosi is cancer.
[00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:12.010]  Yes.
[00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:13.010]  Yes.
[00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:14.010]  Yeah.
[00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:15.010]  She's at least mutagenic.
[00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:16.010]  She has some capacity.
[00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:17.010]  What is wrong with you?
[00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:19.010]  Did I just hear those words?
[00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:21.010]  Did you say Nancy Pelosi?
[00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.010]  My number one dream is the Crypt Keeper.
[00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:24.010]  Oh, okay.
[00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:26.010]  Everyone else wanted Elvira.
[00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:28.010]  He's looking at that snide Crypt Keeper.
[00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:30.010]  Jesse Ventura looks like a Crypt Keeper now.
[00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:33.010]  With all of his stupid little puns.
[00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:35.010]  They're dying to get in.
[00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:39.010]  Like Jesse Ventura.
[00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:43.010]  I talk about, I have all these white friends, comedians who, you know,
[00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:47.010]  the ones that are not close to me and they don't like me, but they say,
[00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:49.010]  I've never used the N-word in my life.
[00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:52.010]  And I say, well, I guess you'd never bet 10 grand on an NBA playoff game.
[00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:58.010]  I go, LeBron James misses a three-pointer with two seconds left.
[00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:59.010]  What are you yelling at the TV?
[00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:01.010]  Oh, that person of color.
[00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:04.010]  Look, this is one of those things where.
[00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:05.010]  But that's good.
[00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:06.010]  It disarms the whole thing.
[00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:07.010]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:08.010]  Oh, my God.
[00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:09.010]  That's exactly right.
[00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:11.010]  And you become inoculated at a certain point.
[00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:13.010]  You know, the hit pieces just that are nonstop.
[00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:15.010]  Like, can you imagine if people knew what happened in green rooms back in
[00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:16.010]  the day?
[00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:17.010]  Oh, man.
[00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:19.010]  And I've been called, this is another one that disarms them.
[00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:20.010]  I was called the N-word.
[00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:21.010]  And this is true.
[00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:22.010]  In middle school.
[00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:24.010]  I'm not so silly.
[00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:27.010]  When I tell the story, you are.
[00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:29.010]  It's so dark in the summertime as a kid.
[00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:34.010]  That all these little white pricks, Irish, would call me Nick, Nick,
[00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:35.010]  the N-word, you know?
[00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:37.010]  And then I say, well, it didn't help.
[00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:40.010]  My mother sent me to school in a purple suit and a fur coat.
[00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.010]  Malcolm X lunch.
[00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:44.010]  I love it.
[00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:46.010]  You posted a dog fight.
[00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:48.010]  Even black.
[00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:51.010]  It's always the white people that have complained my whole career.
[00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:54.010]  I, you know, it's always that white.
[00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:56.010]  There's a lot of white liberals use it for control.
[00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:57.010]  Exactly.
[00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:00.010]  And they're the ones, the first ones.
[00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:03.010]  Now, when I do live comedy, my people come out to see me,
[00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:04.010]  they know it's coming.
[00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:05.010]  So I don't have that many walkouts.
[00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:06.010]  Right.
[00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:07.010]  There's always a couple, you know,
[00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:10.010]  people that walk in that didn't do their homework and research.
[00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:12.010]  Who was at the comedy club?
[00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:15.010]  And it's usually, it's usually four or five white people that, you know,
[00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:17.010]  they can't put two minutes into it.
[00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:19.010]  I'll steal one of Nick's fat jokes.
[00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:20.010]  And they get upset.
[00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:21.010]  I'll steal one of Nick's own jokes.
[00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:23.010]  He performed at the casino.
[00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:24.010]  He walked the reservation.
[00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:25.010]  Yes, I did.
[00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:27.010]  Give me some fat jokes and some facts.
[00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:28.010]  Oh, no.
[00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:29.010]  Come on now.
[00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:30.010]  Look, this is just getting out of control.
[00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:32.010]  But this is my show.
[00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:35.010]  Nick DiPaolo is one of those guys.
[00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:37.010]  Look, people who don't know, we always say like in,
[00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:39.010]  there was a guy, for example, in jujitsu, everyone knew.
[00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:41.010]  And Hicks and Gracie was his name, right?
[00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:42.010]  I'm using a sport that I know, but everyone knew.
[00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:44.010]  Oh, this guy, Riccardo laborio.
[00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:45.010]  He's the guy behind the scenes.
[00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:46.010]  He's the guy everyone went to.
[00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:48.010]  Nick is the guy behind the scenes.
[00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:51.010]  When people need a doctor for their joke, they go to him still to this day.
[00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:52.010]  Right.
[00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:54.010]  They want them to help them behind the scenes,
[00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:56.010]  but they want to put baby in the corner when it's not really.
[00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:58.010]  Nick has never been convenient.
[00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:00.010]  Look, nothing about what we do is easy.
[00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:01.010]  You think you're easy.
[00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:02.010]  I love you dearly.
[00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:05.010]  You're not easy to work with because you're passionate.
[00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:06.010]  You have your ideas.
[00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:09.010]  You're like a ping pong ball all around the room because you care.
[00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:11.010]  And Nick, you're not going to tell Nick.
[00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:13.010]  When have we ever told you on your show?
[00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:14.010]  Have we ever made a call?
[00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:15.010]  Like you should say this.
[00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:16.010]  You shouldn't say that ever once.
[00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:17.010]  Oh, God.
[00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:18.010]  No, no, no.
[00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:19.010]  You know why?
[00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:21.010]  Because he would hang up on me and quit immediately.
[00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:22.010]  I want to hear some of these bad jokes.
[00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:26.010]  No, but somebody sent me an article a few years ago and read it.
[00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:28.010]  And Chris Rock was talking about it.
[00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:35.010]  He goes, there's one white comic out there who is funny as whatever.
[00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:41.010]  And he races his hell, but we absolutely love him.
[00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:42.010]  And I'm reading this.
[00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:44.010]  And so I text Chris Rock.
[00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:46.010]  Were you talking about me?
[00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:48.010]  He's like, you're damn right, Gepardo.
[00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:49.010]  And he goes, it gets better.
[00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:50.010]  We were at Eddie Murphy's house.
[00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:53.010]  Jamie Foxx was there and Arsenio Hall.
[00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:55.010]  And they all loved my comedy.
[00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:56.010]  Yeah.
[00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:59.010]  And I go, hey, Chris, you're racist.
[00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:02.010]  If you call me a racist, that makes him a racist.
[00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:03.010]  That's what I love.
[00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:04.010]  I love black people making white jokes.
[00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:05.010]  It's all funny, man.
[00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:06.010]  Oh, yeah.
[00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:07.010]  Oh, yeah.
[00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:08.010]  It's all funny.
[00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:09.010]  And it used to be OK.
[00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:11.010]  I mean, we've started doing this segment, Black and White and the Gray Issues,
[00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:13.010]  where I just go down to an area, a black area of town.
[00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:16.010]  I say, hey, man, can we just talk like whatever it is, voter ID or talk about
[00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:17.010]  the trans issues?
[00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:18.010]  Because you know what?
[00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:19.010]  We're all black Americans.
[00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:21.010]  And everyone's going to say, look, a bunch of white guys talking.
[00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:22.010]  Yeah.
[00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:26.010]  By the way, I worked for Chris Rock for two years at HBO,
[00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:28.010]  when he had a hit show.
[00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:29.010]  Yeah.
[00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:30.010]  Great guy.
[00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:32.010]  I texted Tony Rock, and he just said, who this?
[00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:34.010]  So I don't have the same showbiz.
[00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:37.010]  But no, we'd go down and we'd talk with people.
[00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:40.010]  And I don't think that there's a group of people who are more overly
[00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:43.010]  represented in the media without being represented at all.
[00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:47.010]  You want to tell me that Joy Reid, that any of these people, or Al Sharpton,
[00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:50.010]  or Van Jones, they have nothing in common with the average black American.
[00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:51.010]  They probably vote Democrat.
[00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:53.010]  They're minions of white communist academics.
[00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:54.010]  Yeah.
[00:52:54.010 --> 00:52:55.010]  And they use them as a puppet.
[00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:57.010]  Like, I don't think America sucks over here.
[00:52:57.010 --> 00:52:58.010]  Yeah.
[00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:00.010]  That's a good puppet voice.
[00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:03.010]  And meanwhile, it's Rachel Maddow with her armor possessed.
[00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:04.010]  Senior Jones-esque.
[00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:06.010]  How did they chop little boys' BBs off?
[00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:07.010]  I don't know.
[00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:08.010]  That's a weird puppet.
[00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:09.010]  That's terrible puppet.
[00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:10.010]  That's horrible.
[00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:11.010]  How'd you get a knife?
[00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:13.010]  That's Kermit the Frog that smuggled the children.
[00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:15.010]  What's wrong with that affair?
[00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:17.010]  That's Kermit the Frog with throat polyps.
[00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:21.010]  His next puppet's going to come out with a voice box.
[00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:23.010]  Hello, I want to drown the children.
[00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:25.010]  Gerald, what else is on your amazing radar?
[00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:26.010]  Hey, can I say one thing about Gerald?
[00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:28.010]  Can I say one thing about Gerald, Alex?
[00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:29.010]  He's unbelievably smart.
[00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:30.010]  That he's lying now?
[00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:31.010]  Gerald is my litmus test.
[00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:32.010]  Gerald is my litmus test.
[00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:37.010]  He's such a, he's, I don't want to say boy scout because he's firm, but he's such a nice guy.
[00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:42.010]  He's such a good man that if someone says, hey, Gerald is a piece of, I go, oh, that person is a liar.
[00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:45.010]  Because you're not going to find a guy nicer and more steadfast than Gerald.
[00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:46.010]  Well, I'm a liar.
[00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:49.010]  Well, Steven, haven't you heard?
[00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:50.010]  I'm very threatening.
[00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:51.010]  Yes.
[00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:52.010]  Oh, yes.
[00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:53.010]  You're very threatening.
[00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:54.010]  Yes, yes, yes.
[00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:55.010]  Running an office is a threatening thing to do.
[00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:57.010]  No, look, we're looking to expand.
[00:53:57.010 --> 00:54:01.010]  Like we've talked about documentaries and some series that we want to do as well in Mug Club.
[00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:04.010]  Just as this grows, really the sky's the limit, right?
[00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:08.010]  So these guys, the comedians in the room, man, gosh, keeping up with them is very difficult.
[00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:11.010]  But they were supposed to be the last line of defense for free speech, right?
[00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:13.010]  The Canary in the Coal Mine, you were part of that.
[00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:21.010]  When they started coming after comedians and saying your comedy's not okay, that's when we started like, oh, there's no safe place for free speech, right?
[00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:25.010]  So having comedians kind of be at the forefront of this makes perfect sense.
[00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:32.010]  Having those specials coming out so more comedians can come and get the best of both worlds of exposure and finances on their specials, that's fantastic.
[00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:33.010]  But there are so many other things.
[00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:38.010]  The animated series that Steven talked about, I think you had like a 10-part series already written.
[00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:39.010]  We need to find the right animator.
[00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:40.010]  A couple of years.
[00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:42.010]  So that's the fun thing about Mug Club.
[00:54:42.010 --> 00:54:44.010]  If you have an idea, great.
[00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:45.010]  Let's do it.
[00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:47.010]  Nick and I are talking about doing a sports show.
[00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:51.010]  It may only have one episode, but we're going to try to put it up.
[00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:52.010]  It's fun.
[00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:53.010]  You've got our Bible.
[00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:54.010]  Yeah, the apologetics thing.
[00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:57.010]  I think one goes up this week, and then the next one goes up next week.
[00:54:57.010 --> 00:54:58.010]  But you know what?
[00:54:58.010 --> 00:54:59.010]  This is really important to note.
[00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:05.010]  So when you talk about sports, okay, you have a lot of these conservative programs out there that'll say like, oh, we're doing a comedy show, but none of them have ever done comedy.
[00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:06.010]  Or we're going to do a sports show.
[00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:08.010]  Nick had a sports show, right?
[00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:10.010]  One of the incredibly popular sports show.
[00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:15.010]  Brian Callen has a sports show that relates to fighting, and Gerald was on full scholarship at Notre Dame.
[00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:19.010]  These aren't billionaires saying, hey, let's have these guys talk sports and make some money off the sports audience.
[00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:23.010]  These people have been doing it their whole life, and it was taken from them because of their points of view.
[00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:26.010]  The left will hold it against you for being a jock.
[00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:27.010]  It's so funny.
[00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:28.010]  It's all about power.
[00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:29.010]  Yeah.
[00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:30.010]  Well, they were the nerds.
[00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:33.010]  And like somebody said, the nerds have the key to the gym right now.
[00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:39.010]  I was about to say, I'm built like a gorilla, and I'm the little guy around here.
[00:55:39.010 --> 00:55:42.010]  You're built like the barrel over the waterfalls.
[00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:44.010]  Kevin.
[00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:45.010]  Oh, yeah.
[00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:46.010]  My friend, Kevin.
[00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:47.010]  Yeah, that's the man.
[00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:48.010]  He's just born that way.
[00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:49.010]  He's 6'8", 340.
[00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:50.010]  Yeah.
[00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:51.010]  He's ripped.
[00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:52.010]  Yeah.
[00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:53.010]  Yeah.
[00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:54.010]  Yeah.
[00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:55.010]  You just can't teach it.
[00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:56.010]  But you know what, though, too?
[00:55:56.010 --> 00:55:57.010]  Same thing that happened with the conservative movement.
[00:55:57.010 --> 00:55:58.010]  Nick, doesn't it bother you more?
[00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:00.010]  You expect the media to come after you, right, and do the hit pieces.
[00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:02.010]  Oh, you know, you really shouldn't say that.
[00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:03.010]  Or that's too far.
[00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:04.010]  That, for me, is when I get...
[00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:05.010]  Well, they're bent in the knee.
[00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:06.010]  Yeah.
[00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:07.010]  It's the comics going after other comics.
[00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:14.010]  Well, when I put my last special out on the album cover, I grabbed a...
[00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:17.010]  It was me giving the finger to like a woke audience.
[00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:23.010]  And I grabbed a picture of a Native American woman, a lesbian, whatever, and a black guy.
[00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:25.010]  And the black guy happened to be...
[00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:27.010]  It was a stock photo.
[00:56:27.010 --> 00:56:28.010]  I just grabbed it.
[00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:29.010]  I grabbed it.
[00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:31.010]  He happened to be one of the first guys to head up BLM.
[00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:33.010]  Ended up getting shot in New Orleans.
[00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:34.010]  Oh, no.
[00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:35.010]  And they thought I chose...
[00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:39.010]  Some female comic was not even on the goddamn radar in New York.
[00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:44.010]  Like an open miker, some Asian girl, complained that I chose him intentionally.
[00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:46.010]  And it started a whole big brouhaha.
[00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:47.010]  Yeah, I know.
[00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:49.010]  It's the most absurd thing in the world.
[00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:50.010]  But look, it's all about we've done something wrong.
[00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:51.010]  No, we've not been arrested.
[00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:52.010]  We're not committing crimes.
[00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:53.010]  Leave us alone.
[00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:54.010]  You guys gotta go.
[00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:56.010]  Some stations don't care that it's the next five.
[00:56:56.010 --> 00:57:00.010]  And then we've got Pastor Rodney Howard Brown who's going to South Africa with all the mass murder going on there.
[00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:01.010]  He's gonna join us.
[00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:04.010]  But do five more minutes with me because I want to talk about how people find this.
[00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:08.010]  People can find Nick DiPaolo at nickdip.com.
[00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:09.010]  Nickdip.com.
[00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:10.010]  Briankellin.com.
[00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:11.010]  He couldn't be here.
[00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:12.010]  Had to fly out.
[00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:13.010]  Amazing guy.
[00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:14.010]  The Mug Club.
[00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:16.010]  The best place to go is simply jonescrowder.com.
[00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:19.010]  And you get a month free at jonescrowder.com.
[00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:20.010]  This is all being added.
[00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:21.010]  This is all going down.
[00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:22.010]  This is huge.
[00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:23.010]  Jonescrowder.com.
[00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:24.010]  You want us to fight?
[00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:25.010]  You want us to build this?
[00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:26.010]  You want us to do it?
[00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:29.010]  Then don't just take $40 billion away from Anheuser-Busch.
[00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:30.010]  Though I love that.
[00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:33.010]  How about you just support us and we will make you proud.
[00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:34.010]  It's not like we're lightweight.
[00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:36.010]  We're at the tip of the spear.
[00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:37.010]  And this is a big deal.
[00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:39.010]  Steven Crowder, he's got big balls.
[00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:42.010]  All the rest of the conservatives, I don't even think, have penises.
[00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:46.010]  So we're going to be right, at least the leadership of them, they'll be right back.
[00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:47.010]  Stay with us.
[00:57:47.010 --> 00:57:48.010]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:56.010]  I beg you to think about how important your word of mouth is and you sharing the articles
[00:57:56.010 --> 00:57:59.010]  and sharing the videos and telling people get the forbidden truth you're not supposed

[00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:56.010]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[00:58:56.010 --> 00:59:01.010]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:05.010]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:08.010]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:11.010]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:16.010]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics
[00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:20.010]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[00:59:20.010 --> 00:59:24.010]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:30.010]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface,
[00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:36.010]  our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:42.010]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:57.010]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:10.010]  Alright, this is a big announcement, a very exciting day.
[01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:15.010]  I don't even have words to hype it here with Stephen Crowder and the rest of his amazing crew.
[01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:18.010]  We obviously have Gerald Morgan here.
[01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:20.010]  Brian Kellen couldn't be here, but he's at BrianKellen.com.
[01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:23.010]  Nick Napalos here, the Hodge twins as well.
[01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:24.010]  Again, Brian just flew out.
[01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:26.010]  Each of you guys, thanks for staying over this last five minutes.
[01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:28.010]  Closing comment from Nick.
[01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:31.010]  I'm just excited. I'm in the presence of greatness.
[01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:34.010]  And I had nowhere to go with...
[01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:37.010]  Luckily, my career, you know, I was flying under the radar.
[01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:39.010]  So I cornered you and you went somewhere good.
[01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:45.010]  That's right. I got cornered and Stephen had a, you know, he came along at the right time, like I said.
[01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:49.010]  I was terrified. I was terrified to call Nick because, again, he was my comedy idol.
[01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:50.010]  Which is hilarious to me.
[01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:52.010]  Well, because I thought he'd be like, who the hell are you? I've been doing this for...
[01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:53.010]  And he's a veteran.
[01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:55.010]  But I was like, hey, we have this platform and I really think you'd...
[01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:56.010]  And he was like, oh, yeah.
[01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:57.010]  And it was just one...
[01:00:57.010 --> 01:00:58.010]  Same thing with you.
[01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:00.010]  Gerald knows. I was like, well, Alex doesn't need anybody.
[01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:01.010]  We're all here.
[01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:02.010]  We're all here.
[01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:07.010]  It's like they say, like the best relationship, you know, even if it's a marriage, is people are together and either one can leave at any time.
[01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:09.010]  It's like gangs in New York when they're about to fight, two gangs join up.
[01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:10.010]  It's kind of like, you know.
[01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:11.010]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:15.010]  It's like the Dead Rabbits and whatever, where Daniel Day-Lewis does the exact same thing as There Will Be Blood, but they give him an Oscar.
[01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:16.010]  It's a different place, yeah.
[01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:19.010]  I'm the butcher. I'm the oil man.
[01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:20.010]  Oh, wow. What a range.
[01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.010]  Cut this awful piece of that beef off.
[01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:22.010]  Yeah.
[01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:25.010]  But Nick is just a guy who I've loved for a long time and just, you know, even being...
[01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:27.010]  It means that we all want to be here.
[01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:30.010]  And like you've talked about, when people talk about growing, look, I hope that people see the fruits of their labor.
[01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:34.010]  Like we started Mug Club with something that was really just our show and doing the Friday show and expanding.
[01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:35.010]  Yeah.
[01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:37.010]  We could just take it and go, but we wouldn't have as many people.
[01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:39.010]  And if you sell out, they try to shut it down and you survive.
[01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:41.010]  I mean, how many times have we been suspended in the last six months?
[01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:42.010]  Great, fine, we'll do it.
[01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:44.010]  We want to be on YouTube.
[01:01:44.010 --> 01:01:49.010]  We want to be on all those platforms so long as we are not there at the cost of the truth.
[01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:50.010]  And so we'll take the suspensions.
[01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:52.010]  We've already been demonetized for years.
[01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:54.010]  I don't give a rat's ass anymore.
[01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:58.010]  We are funded entirely by viewers like you, by viewers like Alex's.
[01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:02.010]  And if just a tenth of you out there say, all right, I'm going to give it a shot, guess what?
[01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:03.010]  There's no chance.
[01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:05.010]  And Nick, what's your promo code for folks that want to sign up?
[01:02:05.010 --> 01:02:06.010]  Nickdip.com.
[01:02:06.010 --> 01:02:07.010]  Nickdip.com.
[01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:08.010]  You were about to say something before he cut you off.
[01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:09.010]  Huh?
[01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:11.010]  No, I was going to say you sounded like a PBS guy.
[01:02:11.010 --> 01:02:12.010]  Yeah.
[01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:14.010]  Your contribution to a tote bag.
[01:02:14.010 --> 01:02:15.010]  With a telethon.
[01:02:15.010 --> 01:02:18.010]  The commies get billions and they beg for money on top of it.
[01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:19.010]  That's right.
[01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:21.010]  Here's a $100 thing.
[01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:24.010]  Here's a CD for $5,000.
[01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:25.010]  I don't think I've seen that.
[01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:26.010]  Here's a tote bag for $300.
[01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:29.010]  A Julia Child cookbook for $450.
[01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:34.010]  Here's a Preparation HQ can for $300.
[01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:36.010]  A tote bag to put your wife's head in.
[01:02:36.010 --> 01:02:37.010]  Yes, exactly.
[01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:38.010]  Exactly.
[01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:39.010]  Julia Child.
[01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:40.010]  While we're reaching, we've got Danny Kaye.
[01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:41.010]  We've got Julia Child.
[01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:43.010]  We've got his pedophile puppet.
[01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:46.010]  Alex Jones is doing Julia Child.
[01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:47.010]  I know.
[01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:49.010]  I love this bacon.
[01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:51.010]  Stuff it in there.
[01:02:51.010 --> 01:02:52.010]  Delicious.
[01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:54.010]  That would be the hardest voice for Alex to do.
[01:02:54.010 --> 01:02:56.010]  That's hilarious.
[01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:57.010]  The hardest voice for him to do.
[01:02:57.010 --> 01:02:59.010]  I love butter.
[01:02:59.010 --> 01:03:01.010]  I'll get you next time.
[01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:02.010]  I would love an Alex Jones cooking show.
[01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:06.010]  Like, all right, I'm going to stuff this hand with vodka.
[01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:07.010]  Hold on.
[01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:08.010]  This is not really alcohol.
[01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:09.010]  No.
[01:03:09.010 --> 01:03:10.010]  This is not really alcohol.
[01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:11.010]  Oh, Lord.
[01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:12.010]  Oh, Lord.
[01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:13.010]  Sorry.
[01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:14.010]  I'm sorry.
[01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:16.010]  Yeah, it's peach schnapple.
[01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:19.010]  Folks, I don't really drink beer or whiskey.
[01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:21.010]  This is fake.
[01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:24.010]  The key to good brisket is whiskey.
[01:03:24.010 --> 01:03:25.010]  It's Everclear.
[01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:26.010]  Now, look, look.
[01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:28.010]  I'm going to tell you that it doesn't work, but that's just because I want to control
[01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:30.010]  you with mind control and chemical agents.
[01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:31.010]  Bottom line, folks.
[01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:32.010]  Everclear.
[01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:33.010]  Jonescrowder.com.
[01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:34.010]  Free month.
[01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:37.010]  Right now, go sign up or you're coming and you hate America and literally you want to
[01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:38.010]  lose.
[01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:39.010]  I mean, who's fighting for you?
[01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:41.010]  Gerald Captain Morgan.
[01:03:41.010 --> 01:03:42.010]  Closing comments.
[01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:43.010]  Oh, that's a good nickname.
[01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:44.010]  I can't believe I didn't think that.
[01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:45.010]  Look, this is just the beginning, guys.
[01:03:45.010 --> 01:03:47.010]  You have seen us take some major steps.
[01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:51.010]  We've got the white whale, like we said, the number one draft pick free agent guy out there.
[01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:52.010]  We brought him onto the platform.
[01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:54.010]  The network is growing right now.
[01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:55.010]  He's actually just doing more shows.
[01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:56.010]  I'm going to keep talking.
[01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:58.010]  You're going to be doing more shows, more content.
[01:03:58.010 --> 01:04:02.010]  Like, listen, if you want to win, this is not a pump and dump marketing scheme where
[01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:06.010]  we want you to buy something so you feel like you're helping and you feel like you're winning.
[01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:08.010]  No, you're going to buy products that are good.
[01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:10.010]  If he has sponsors, they're good sponsors.
[01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:12.010]  If we have sponsors, same thing.
[01:04:12.010 --> 01:04:13.010]  Good sponsors.
[01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:15.010]  But you're voting Mug Club right here.
[01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:21.010]  Support something that can actually change people's minds and does on a daily basis.
[01:04:21.010 --> 01:04:23.010]  Steven Crowder, Alex Jones, all you guys.
[01:04:23.010 --> 01:04:25.010]  We're long haul, folks.
[01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:27.010]  If there's anybody long haul, let them back down.
[01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:28.010]  It's us.
[01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:29.010]  I love you, brother.
[01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:30.010]  You're the white whale.
[01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:33.010]  And I will leave you with Nick Nolte as Captain Ahab if he doesn't work.
[01:04:33.010 --> 01:04:35.010]  We're lost, you son of a bitch.
[01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:36.010]  We're lost.
[01:04:36.010 --> 01:04:37.010]  Amazing.
[01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:38.010]  All right.
[01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:39.010]  I love you guys.
[01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:45.010]  Check dip.com, briankelland.com, and jonescrowder.com to get that free month right now.
[01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:46.010]  If you don't go sign up, folks, whatever.
[01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:47.010]  I'm fighting as hard as I can.
[01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:48.010]  I love you to death.
[01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:50.010]  I want this to explode because I want to impress these guys.
[01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:51.010]  They've already exploded.
[01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:53.010]  I'm kind of like, I'm just blessed to be here.
[01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:54.010]  It's great.
[01:04:54.010 --> 01:04:55.010]  I love the energy.
[01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:56.010]  Love you guys.
[01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:57.010]  Love you.
[01:04:57.010 --> 01:04:58.010]  We love you.
[01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:59.010]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:00.010]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:01.010]  We're going to go to South Africa where they're murdering all the white people.
[01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:04.010]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the
[01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:05.010]  answer.
[01:05:05.010 --> 01:05:08.010]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil.
[01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:13.010]  The incredible things it does for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological system,
[01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:15.010]  for your nervous system particularly.
[01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:17.010]  Everybody knows it's incredible.
[01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:18.010]  It works.
[01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:22.010]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:29.010]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more because that's who we're getting it from.
[01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:31.010]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:35.010]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[01:05:36.010 --> 01:05:41.010]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[01:05:41.010 --> 01:05:44.010]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:46.010]  And here's what's even crazier.
[01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:48.010]  30% off of what they're selling it for.
[01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:51.010]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:55.010]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:56.010]  Rebel Zen.
[01:05:56.010 --> 01:05:59.010]  Get yours at InfoWareStore.com now.
[01:06:05.010 --> 01:06:09.010]  You are either with the republic or against it.
[01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:13.010]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:16.010]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:37.010]  We're in.
[01:07:05.010 --> 01:07:29.010]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[01:07:29.010 --> 01:07:33.010]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[01:07:33.010 --> 01:07:35.010]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:37.010]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:41.010]  This is a different kind of war.
[01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:45.010]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:49.010]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:53.010]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:07:53.010 --> 01:07:55.010]  It was almost as if it were a plan invoked.
[01:07:55.010 --> 01:07:57.010]  It just can't happen.
[01:07:57.010 --> 01:07:59.010]  We need to go into the capital.
[01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:01.010]  That's it. That's it.
[01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:03.010]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:05.010]  They are nothing but distractions.
[01:08:05.010 --> 01:08:07.010]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:09.010]  You silenced those voices.
[01:08:09.010 --> 01:08:13.010]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:20.010]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:52.010]  Ladies and gentlemen, my personal pastor, a great American, Rodney Howard Brown, takes over now.
[01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:55.010]  But first, the Star-Spangled Banner at his church about five weeks ago.
[01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:57.010]  Here it is.
[01:08:57.010 --> 01:08:59.010]  All right. For the Star-Spangled Banner.
[01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:35.010]  At the twilight's last gleaming.
[01:09:35.010 --> 01:09:47.010]  Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight.
[01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:59.010]  O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming.
[01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:12.010]  And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air.
[01:10:12.010 --> 01:10:28.010]  Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
[01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:45.010]  Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave.
[01:10:45.010 --> 01:10:57.010]  O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[01:10:57.010 --> 01:11:14.010]  Of the brave.
[01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:18.010]  Live from Tampa, the River Church, Rodney Howard Brown.
[01:11:18.010 --> 01:11:23.010]  Amazing.
[01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:27.010]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday edition.
[01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:29.010]  Such exciting announcements today.
[01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:31.010]  JohnsCrowder.com.
[01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:33.010]  But for the balance of the hour, we've got something very serious to talk about.
[01:11:33.010 --> 01:11:39.010]  He's about to do an emergency mission to, what is it, ten countries or more in Africa, particularly his home country, South Africa,
[01:11:39.010 --> 01:11:47.010]  where the communists have taken control and replaced one evil with something far greater in its magnitude of satanic force.
[01:11:48.010 --> 01:11:50.010]  Black tribes murdering black tribes.
[01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:54.010]  Black tribes under the direction of the government murdering whites en masse.
[01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:56.010]  Kill the boar.
[01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:58.010]  All of this, the New York Times defending it.
[01:11:58.010 --> 01:12:02.010]  This is quite a moment to be alive where they attack songs like Not in a Small Town.
[01:12:02.010 --> 01:12:04.010]  It just calls for unity and self-defense.
[01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:06.010]  Calling that racist.
[01:12:06.010 --> 01:12:08.010]  But kill white people is a good thing.
[01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:10.010]  This is pure evil.
[01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:12.010]  And Rodney Howard Brown is about to literally parachute into this cauldron.
[01:12:12.010 --> 01:12:14.010]  So, Pastor, thank you for joining us.
[01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:19.010]  First, then the indictment of Trump on January 6th and the war with Russia and all the big developments.
[01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:21.010]  I love you, Pastor.
[01:12:21.010 --> 01:12:25.010]  I've known you for many years, but getting to visit your church was one of the highlights of my life.
[01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:29.010]  I appreciate you and your wife and your whole family and your whole family church and the work you're doing.
[01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:31.010]  So, God bless you.
[01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:33.010]  You're a total blessing.
[01:12:33.010 --> 01:12:35.010]  Alex, it's so great to see you.
[01:12:35.010 --> 01:12:38.010]  That was a great night, the night with Alex.
[01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:40.010]  People still talk about it.
[01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:44.010]  And anyway, it was great to see Nick DiPaolo on with you.
[01:12:44.010 --> 01:12:46.010]  He cracks me up.
[01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:50.010]  When I turned in the pre-thing, I'm looking, there's Nick DiPaolo.
[01:12:50.010 --> 01:12:54.010]  I mean, it looks like you've got a star lineup of what you're doing.
[01:12:54.010 --> 01:12:58.010]  Now, this next whole phase of what's going to happen is going to be pretty phenomenal.
[01:12:58.010 --> 01:13:01.010]  So, but honored to be on with you today.
[01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:05.010]  And yeah, what's happening in South Africa is crazy.
[01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:09.010]  But this has been going on for the longest of times.
[01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:11.010]  So, all of this is another wave.
[01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:19.010]  And, of course, it only gains attention when you see Julius Malema in front of 100,000 people singing,
[01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:21.010]  kill the boor, the boor.
[01:13:21.010 --> 01:13:26.010]  But this has been the modus operandi for a long time.
[01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:29.010]  And you can see all those white flags that they just showed.
[01:13:29.010 --> 01:13:31.010]  That's for every farmer that got killed.
[01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:35.010]  Right after this event, they went and killed an elderly couple.
[01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:38.010]  And, I mean, Alex, the pictures are so grotesque.
[01:13:38.010 --> 01:13:43.010]  Basically, they're taking, they'll take the man, they'll tie him up,
[01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:48.010]  they will cut his eyelids off so that he can't close his eyelids.
[01:13:48.010 --> 01:13:51.010]  Then they will rape his wife in front of him.
[01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:54.010]  They'll gang rape his wife and then cut her throat.
[01:13:54.010 --> 01:14:00.010]  But they'll dismember her slowly before they kill her so that he watches this total torture.
[01:14:00.010 --> 01:14:04.010]  They take the children, they will boil them in hot water.
[01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:07.010]  And, of course, after they've raped the kid and done whatever.
[01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:10.010]  So now the father is sitting there.
[01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:11.010]  He has to watch this.
[01:14:11.010 --> 01:14:12.010]  He can't look in.
[01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:13.010]  He can't close his eyes.
[01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:16.010]  By the way, this is admitted mainstream news.
[01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:17.010]  This is it.
[01:14:17.010 --> 01:14:18.010]  I don't mean to interrupt, Pastor.
[01:14:18.010 --> 01:14:19.010]  This is admitted mainstream.
[01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:22.010]  They defend boiling of children and the raping.
[01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:25.010]  I mean, this is the standard protocol.
[01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:29.010]  Winnie Mandela, it was burn children up in tires, put a tire around their neck,
[01:14:29.010 --> 01:14:31.010]  necklacing.
[01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:33.010]  So please continue.
[01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:35.010]  Yeah, so this has been going on for a long time.
[01:14:35.010 --> 01:14:37.010]  This is not something that's new.
[01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:43.010]  It just gained attention now because of that big scene of 100,000 in the stadium.
[01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:48.010]  And then Julius Malema, you know, chanting or singing, kill the bird,
[01:14:48.010 --> 01:14:51.010]  which is like a freedom song for them.
[01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:54.010]  So, unfortunately, that's just the chant.
[01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:57.010]  But right after that, they started killing some farmers.
[01:14:57.010 --> 01:15:00.010]  So it's a terrible situation, basically,
[01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:06.010]  which people can't believe that that would even come to America.
[01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:08.010]  But if they can do this in South Africa,
[01:15:08.010 --> 01:15:12.010]  then what are they going to try to do in America in the next 10 years?
[01:15:12.010 --> 01:15:14.010]  Because, first of all, people are going to say,
[01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:19.010]  well, it's just a racial thing, white versus black, and killing the farmers.
[01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:23.010]  It's really to destroy all the food supply, which they don't understand.
[01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:28.010]  The only people that are supporting the food supply are the farmers.
[01:15:28.010 --> 01:15:31.010]  So if you can create a situation where you kill all the farmers,
[01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:35.010]  they did this in Venezuela, where people are eating dog.
[01:15:35.010 --> 01:15:37.010]  They're eating anything that they can eat.
[01:15:37.010 --> 01:15:40.010]  So this is what communism does.
[01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:44.010]  It comes in, and you can look throughout history.
[01:15:44.010 --> 01:15:46.010]  Alex, you know this better than anybody else.
[01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:47.010]  You can look through history.
[01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:48.010]  They did this in Europe.
[01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:50.010]  They did this in countries in Europe.
[01:15:50.010 --> 01:15:54.010]  Wherever there were farmers, first thing they do, they kill the farmers.
[01:15:54.010 --> 01:15:58.010]  So in South Africa, they use it in the white and black situation.
[01:15:58.010 --> 01:16:02.010]  In other countries, obviously, if it's in Venezuela,
[01:16:02.010 --> 01:16:05.010]  it's the own people killing their own people.
[01:16:05.010 --> 01:16:07.010]  But who's going to grow the food?
[01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:08.010]  They don't really care.
[01:16:08.010 --> 01:16:10.010]  Look at America's food supply.
[01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:14.010]  They're destroying cattle, the cattle industry.
[01:16:14.010 --> 01:16:16.010]  They're destroying the chicken industry.
[01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:18.010]  They're destroying everything.
[01:16:18.010 --> 01:16:20.010]  Let me interrupt you because you're so on target.
[01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:21.010]  You lived through this.
[01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:22.010]  So you're our expert here.
[01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:24.010]  You've experienced this and fought this.
[01:16:24.010 --> 01:16:27.010]  If we look at what happened in Zimbabwe,
[01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:30.010]  they came in and killed all the white farmers, and they starved to death
[01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:32.010]  and imploded.
[01:16:32.010 --> 01:16:34.010]  But if you look at the Netherlands or you look at Ireland,
[01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:38.010]  where they're now getting rid of large portions of the farms we have.
[01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:42.010]  John Kerry is saying we've got to cut off the farms to save the earth.
[01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:46.010]  They're literally cutting world food supply, knowing it will cause unrest.
[01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:48.010]  And as you pointed out, in Rwanda,
[01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:52.010]  the UN played one animist tribe off against the Christian group that was
[01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:54.010]  actually stabilizing things.
[01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:56.010]  And so they'll play black off against black.
[01:16:56.010 --> 01:17:00.010]  Whatever fissure there is, the communists do that.
[01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:01.010]  Yeah, they don't care.
[01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:05.010]  It's just so they can push their agenda later on.
[01:17:05.010 --> 01:17:07.010]  But this has not been stopped.
[01:17:07.010 --> 01:17:10.010]  But now let me just tell you, it's not everywhere.
[01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:12.010]  It's in certain places.
[01:17:12.010 --> 01:17:17.010]  And, of course, the farmers and even the African people have gone as far
[01:17:17.010 --> 01:17:19.010]  to actually protect themselves.
[01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:23.010]  So what you are seeing are cases that are taking place.
[01:17:23.010 --> 01:17:25.010]  I'm not taking away from this.
[01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:27.010]  And obviously they haven't started the genocide.
[01:17:27.010 --> 01:17:28.010]  That's why I had you here.
[01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:30.010]  Who are the players?
[01:17:30.010 --> 01:17:31.010]  Who are the players?
[01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:32.010]  You're an expert.
[01:17:32.010 --> 01:17:33.010]  You're from there.
[01:17:33.010 --> 01:17:35.010]  You go there all the time at your own risk, your own life.
[01:17:35.010 --> 01:17:36.010]  People don't know.
[01:17:36.010 --> 01:17:38.010]  Most of the blacks aren't like this.
[01:17:38.010 --> 01:17:39.010]  This is the communists.
[01:17:39.010 --> 01:17:43.010]  So explain who the bad players are, who the good players are.
[01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:44.010]  Yeah.
[01:17:44.010 --> 01:17:47.010]  Most of the African people, they don't want any of this.
[01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:49.010]  Everybody loves each other.
[01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:52.010]  So it's not like, I mean, I'm going to go there now.
[01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:55.010]  I probably won't see any of this.
[01:17:55.010 --> 01:17:58.010]  But there are areas that are targeted.
[01:17:58.010 --> 01:18:01.010]  And so the bottom line is that right now in Cape Town,
[01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:04.010]  there's a massive killing between the taxis that are going on,
[01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:06.010]  all the taxis on strike.
[01:18:06.010 --> 01:18:07.010]  They're burning taxis.
[01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:08.010]  They're killing people.
[01:18:08.010 --> 01:18:10.010]  So Cape Town's in a major thing.
[01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:12.010]  It's got nothing to do with the farmers.
[01:18:12.010 --> 01:18:14.010]  It's basically all the taxis going on strike.
[01:18:14.010 --> 01:18:18.010]  On strike, people are sending me footage of them blowing up stuff
[01:18:18.010 --> 01:18:19.010]  and what's taking place.
[01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:22.010]  So, I mean, obviously communism is behind it.
[01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:25.010]  But I have a different view.
[01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:28.010]  Obviously, everything is controlled out of London, England.
[01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:30.010]  So Julius Malema, as far as I'm concerned,
[01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:32.010]  is controlled out of London, England,
[01:18:32.010 --> 01:18:35.010]  the same as Ramaphosa is controlled out of London, England,
[01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:37.010]  because that's the financial capital of the world.
[01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:41.010]  And that's how, if you look, I mean,
[01:18:41.010 --> 01:18:44.010]  it's kind of laughable because even when you look at what's happening now.
[01:18:44.010 --> 01:18:46.010]  You wrote a 600-page book on this.
[01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:47.010]  So explain.
[01:18:47.010 --> 01:18:48.010]  You're right.
[01:18:48.010 --> 01:18:50.010]  Explain London, England, not the people of England,
[01:18:50.010 --> 01:18:53.010]  but the Bank of England, the City of England,
[01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:55.010]  the City of London, the financial center.
[01:18:55.010 --> 01:18:57.010]  Explain why they want this.
[01:18:57.010 --> 01:19:00.010]  Yeah, because that's global control.
[01:19:00.010 --> 01:19:04.010]  So basically what started over 200 years ago with the Bank of England
[01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:07.010]  and now the Federal Reserve of America,
[01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:09.010]  which now apparently our debt,
[01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:13.010]  the interest on the debt every day is $5 billion a day,
[01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:15.010]  $5 billion USD a day.
[01:19:15.010 --> 01:19:18.010]  That's why our government is not going to do anything to balance the book.
[01:19:18.010 --> 01:19:25.010]  But the bottom line is these are the people that are really running the planet.
[01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:26.010]  They sit behind closed doors.
[01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:27.010]  They play a chess game.
[01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:28.010]  Okay.
[01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:32.010]  I mean, the classic example right now is what's happening in Niger,
[01:19:32.010 --> 01:19:36.010]  Niger from Nigeria, which I'm going right to the area in Nigeria.
[01:19:36.010 --> 01:19:37.010]  That's the first country we're going to.
[01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:42.010]  They run the Saharan pipeline all the way to the Mediterranean.
[01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:47.010]  And Niger, the whole disagreement between Nigeria and Niger,
[01:19:47.010 --> 01:19:52.010]  because Nigeria is backed by, you know, American forces.
[01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:54.010]  Niger is backed by Russia.
[01:19:54.010 --> 01:19:58.010]  So it looks like they're almost taking what failed now in the Ukraine
[01:19:58.010 --> 01:20:02.010]  and transferring it to this whole block in Africa.
[01:20:03.010 --> 01:20:05.010]  The map, I have a map here.
[01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:08.010]  If you guys can put it up for me, Mali, Niger.
[01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:13.010]  You see all the ones in the green are the ones that are on the one side.
[01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:16.010]  But Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea,
[01:20:16.010 --> 01:20:20.010]  they're going to fight with Niger, and this is being backed by China,
[01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:23.010]  by Russia, and by North Korea.
[01:20:23.010 --> 01:20:28.010]  So, I mean, we just had the king of Nigeria at our church Sunday morning
[01:20:28.010 --> 01:20:31.010]  and night with the queen, and we talked at length.
[01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:32.010]  You know, he said,
[01:20:32.010 --> 01:20:35.010]  we've really got to pray that none of this stuff tries to penetrate
[01:20:35.010 --> 01:20:37.010]  into the country in Nigeria.
[01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:39.010]  But this is what's going on.
[01:20:39.010 --> 01:20:43.010]  So, again, I know, and we're talking about South Africa,
[01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:46.010]  but the same things happen in Namibia.
[01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:48.010]  The same things happen in Zimbabwe.
[01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:50.010]  The same thing happens in Mozambique.
[01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:52.010]  The same things happen in Zimbabwe.
[01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:56.010]  Really, wherever they can mess up the food supply of people
[01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:58.010]  and create a disruption,
[01:20:58.010 --> 01:21:03.010]  because then they come in for the mineral wealth that's there.
[01:21:03.010 --> 01:21:04.010]  And this is all about that.
[01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:10.010]  Niger, it's all about that pipeline that's now feeding the whole of Europe.
[01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:13.010]  So, of course, many of the Africans are saying,
[01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:15.010]  we don't want the oil going to the colonialists.
[01:21:15.010 --> 01:21:17.010]  So, there's like a whole big thing.
[01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:20.010]  Everything's going back to the days of, you know,
[01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:24.010]  Nigeria got independence from England in 1960.
[01:21:24.010 --> 01:21:28.010]  South Africa got independence from, sorry,
[01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:31.010]  Nigeria got independence from England in 1960.
[01:21:31.010 --> 01:21:35.010]  South Africa got independence from England in 1961.
[01:21:35.010 --> 01:21:37.010]  But they still controlled everything.
[01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:40.010]  They controlled imports.
[01:21:40.010 --> 01:21:41.010]  They controlled coal.
[01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:45.010]  They controlled maize, corn, whatever.
[01:21:45.010 --> 01:21:46.010]  Again, I don't understand.
[01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:48.010]  If you're making money on the one side,
[01:21:48.010 --> 01:21:50.010]  why would you then destroy the supplier?
[01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:54.010]  It can only be now to plunge the people into a place where they're poverty stricken.
[01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:57.010]  I'm an outsider studying this.
[01:21:57.010 --> 01:21:59.010]  It's very simple.
[01:21:59.010 --> 01:22:01.010]  You have mega banks that are still the colonialists,
[01:22:01.010 --> 01:22:04.010]  that if they can cause a race war, they can rob everybody.
[01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:05.010]  And as you said,
[01:22:05.010 --> 01:22:08.010]  and I'm not an apologist for black racism in South Africa,
[01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:10.010]  but as you said, it's global funded.
[01:22:10.010 --> 01:22:11.010]  If you look all over Africa,
[01:22:11.010 --> 01:22:13.010]  where you come and speak to the presidents, everybody,
[01:22:13.010 --> 01:22:14.010]  they're all talking about it.
[01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:16.010]  They refuse the COVID shots more than anybody.
[01:22:16.010 --> 01:22:18.010]  They know about the new world order.
[01:22:18.010 --> 01:22:19.010]  They're making deals with Russia.
[01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:22.010]  It seems like Africans are some of the most awake people,
[01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:26.010]  other than these communist enclaves that the British intel controls.
[01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:30.010]  We're finding that out now,
[01:22:30.010 --> 01:22:34.010]  and I'll be able to better report to you after the 10-country tour.
[01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:36.010]  I'm actually gone for five and a half weeks, Alex,
[01:22:36.010 --> 01:22:38.010]  so it's going to be a run.
[01:22:38.010 --> 01:22:40.010]  I have a team of 19 people with me,
[01:22:40.010 --> 01:22:42.010]  and we stop in Nigeria.
[01:22:42.010 --> 01:22:43.010]  We go on to Ethiopia,
[01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:45.010]  then we're in Kenya,
[01:22:45.010 --> 01:22:47.010]  and then we go down to Malawi,
[01:22:47.010 --> 01:22:48.010]  then South Africa,
[01:22:48.010 --> 01:22:50.010]  and then we go to Swaziland,
[01:22:50.010 --> 01:22:52.010]  then to Namibia,
[01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:53.010]  and then from Namibia,
[01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:56.010]  we go to Zambia,
[01:22:56.010 --> 01:22:57.010]  then Botswana,
[01:22:57.010 --> 01:22:59.010]  and then on to Uganda,
[01:22:59.010 --> 01:23:00.010]  and then home.
[01:23:00.010 --> 01:23:02.010]  And we were going to Lesotho,
[01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:04.010]  but the airport,
[01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:06.010]  they can't service the aircraft.
[01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:09.010]  They can't even fuel the aircraft or whatever.
[01:23:09.010 --> 01:23:11.010]  I mean, it shows you how the infrastructure of a major country,
[01:23:11.010 --> 01:23:12.010]  broken down,
[01:23:12.010 --> 01:23:14.010]  when you can fly in there with a plane,
[01:23:14.010 --> 01:23:15.010]  and they say,
[01:23:15.010 --> 01:23:16.010]  we can't help you.
[01:23:16.010 --> 01:23:19.010]  So you have to fly in with tiny planes
[01:23:19.010 --> 01:23:21.010]  and be able to handle yourself
[01:23:21.010 --> 01:23:23.010]  and fly out without refueling.
[01:23:23.010 --> 01:23:26.010]  So you just watch,
[01:23:26.010 --> 01:23:28.010]  and then you talk to some of these kings.
[01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:30.010]  Some of the presidents tell me,
[01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:32.010]  so we have lithium in our country,
[01:23:32.010 --> 01:23:33.010]  and the Chinese are coming
[01:23:33.010 --> 01:23:34.010]  and they want our lithium,
[01:23:34.010 --> 01:23:37.010]  and we've got this mineral or that mineral.
[01:23:37.010 --> 01:23:40.010]  One of the pastors that I'm going to see
[01:23:40.010 --> 01:23:43.010]  has just bought three massive combine harvesters,
[01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:45.010]  and I haven't talked to him in 20 years,
[01:23:45.010 --> 01:23:46.010]  so I'm going to be with him.
[01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:48.010]  He's in Uganda,
[01:23:48.010 --> 01:23:50.010]  and he's just put,
[01:23:50.010 --> 01:23:51.010]  I don't know how many square miles,
[01:23:51.010 --> 01:23:52.010]  he told me,
[01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:57.010]  and put it under cultivation for maize,
[01:23:57.010 --> 01:23:58.010]  I believe it is.
[01:23:58.010 --> 01:24:01.010]  And so we were talking at length on the phone.
[01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:03.010]  So they are awake.
[01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:04.010]  People are awake.
[01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:05.010]  They don't know what to do.
[01:24:05.010 --> 01:24:07.010]  They say, what do we do with the Chinese?
[01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:08.010]  What do we do with the Russians?
[01:24:08.010 --> 01:24:10.010]  And I'm not being politically correct.
[01:24:10.010 --> 01:24:11.010]  Liberals claim they love black people.
[01:24:11.010 --> 01:24:12.010]  They don't.
[01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:13.010]  They're trying to kill them and destroy them.
[01:24:13.010 --> 01:24:14.010]  You're saying,
[01:24:14.010 --> 01:24:15.010]  and that's what I've seen from the news,
[01:24:15.010 --> 01:24:16.010]  but you're the expert,
[01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:17.010]  the majority of folks want Christ,
[01:24:17.010 --> 01:24:18.010]  want freedom,
[01:24:18.010 --> 01:24:19.010]  get what's going on.
[01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:21.010]  It's only these communist command bases
[01:24:21.010 --> 01:24:22.010]  that are going on.
[01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:24.010]  So the Africans are our friends overall.
[01:24:24.010 --> 01:24:27.010]  Yeah, totally.
[01:24:27.010 --> 01:24:28.010]  They're not enemies.
[01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:30.010]  And the problem is,
[01:24:30.010 --> 01:24:31.010]  so here's the problem, Alex.
[01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:34.010]  I mean, we can call the communists the problem,
[01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:37.010]  but when you see how our country's been taken over,
[01:24:37.010 --> 01:24:39.010]  then you have to see, okay,
[01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:41.010]  so there's elements,
[01:24:41.010 --> 01:24:43.010]  I'm not saying the whole of the FBI is bad,
[01:24:43.010 --> 01:24:45.010]  but a lot is bad.
[01:24:45.010 --> 01:24:47.010]  And I'm not saying the whole of the CIA is bad,
[01:24:47.010 --> 01:24:48.010]  but a lot is bad.
[01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:50.010]  So there's the communist element
[01:24:50.010 --> 01:24:52.010]  that's taken over the CIA, the FBI,
[01:24:52.010 --> 01:24:54.010]  or the State Department,
[01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:56.010]  and that's what's now having an effect.
[01:24:56.010 --> 01:24:58.010]  So if you go to Africa, people say,
[01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:59.010]  well, who's doing it?
[01:24:59.010 --> 01:25:01.010]  Well, it's really the State Department doing this.
[01:25:01.010 --> 01:25:02.010]  Well, who's doing this?
[01:25:02.010 --> 01:25:04.010]  Well, it's members of the FBI or CIA
[01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:08.010]  or rogue element, rogue mercenaries.
[01:25:08.010 --> 01:25:10.010]  Well, who's paying the mercenary?
[01:25:10.010 --> 01:25:16.010]  They're funded by some soros-backed organization
[01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:18.010]  pushing vaccines,
[01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:22.010]  which everything leads to sterilization of tribes,
[01:25:22.010 --> 01:25:24.010]  and it goes on and on.
[01:25:24.010 --> 01:25:26.010]  So they want to control everything.
[01:25:26.010 --> 01:25:28.010]  They want to control the movement of people.
[01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:30.010]  They want to control how many babies you have.
[01:25:30.010 --> 01:25:31.010]  They want to control what you eat.
[01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:34.010]  And then you can see everything coming with,
[01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:37.010]  they were saying that cockroach milk
[01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:39.010]  is now more nutritionist,
[01:25:39.010 --> 01:25:42.010]  more nutrition in a cockroach milk than in milk.
[01:25:42.010 --> 01:25:43.010]  I saw that, guys.
[01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:45.010]  I bet you covered that last week.
[01:25:45.010 --> 01:25:49.010]  Cockroach milk, folks, which tightens pure poison.
[01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:51.010]  Guys, Google cockroach milk.
[01:25:51.010 --> 01:25:53.010]  He's not making it up.
[01:25:53.010 --> 01:25:56.010]  Imagine a cockroach milk latte.
[01:25:56.010 --> 01:26:01.010]  And then people are eating crickets
[01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:03.010]  and every kind of bug.
[01:26:03.010 --> 01:26:05.010]  We were never meant to eat that.
[01:26:05.010 --> 01:26:08.010]  And these things carry all kinds of parasites
[01:26:08.010 --> 01:26:10.010]  and every kind of thing known to man.
[01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:13.010]  So basically, it just plunges people into sickness and disease,
[01:26:13.010 --> 01:26:14.010]  which they're happy about.
[01:26:14.010 --> 01:26:16.010]  There you are, cockroach milk.
[01:26:16.010 --> 01:26:18.010]  Yes, you read that right.
[01:26:18.010 --> 01:26:20.010]  Oh, Alex, that sounds yum.
[01:26:20.010 --> 01:26:22.010]  Wouldn't you like a cockroach?
[01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:25.010]  Alex, don't you want a cockroach milk latte?
[01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:28.010]  Well, Pastor, you are so smart.
[01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:29.010]  I'm not kissing your butt.
[01:26:29.010 --> 01:26:30.010]  It's true.
[01:26:30.010 --> 01:26:31.010]  You're one of the smartest people I know.
[01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:32.010]  You've advised me over the years.
[01:26:32.010 --> 01:26:33.010]  Everything you said came true.
[01:26:33.010 --> 01:26:35.010]  So when we come back, I want to try to give you the floor
[01:26:35.010 --> 01:26:40.010]  and just run the gambit here of Trump's January 6th indictment,
[01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:43.010]  what's happening, the economy, the dollar,
[01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:47.010]  and the U.S. government being devalued by the credit score agencies
[01:26:47.010 --> 01:26:48.010]  and just where we are.
[01:26:48.010 --> 01:26:50.010]  But before we go any further, when we come back from break,
[01:26:50.010 --> 01:26:53.010]  I sent the crew – I meant to give it to them earlier,
[01:26:53.010 --> 01:26:56.010]  but I just gave it to them right now – a promo you sent me
[01:26:56.010 --> 01:26:58.010]  over a week ago of your African trip.
[01:26:58.010 --> 01:27:01.010]  So I sent that to Scott, the crew.
[01:27:01.010 --> 01:27:03.010]  We can grab that and get that to the computer.
[01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:05.010]  I want to come back and play that next segment.
[01:27:05.010 --> 01:27:06.010]  But we've got a minute and a half to break.
[01:27:06.010 --> 01:27:12.010]  Pastor Brown, what else are you going to dial us into when we return?
[01:27:12.010 --> 01:27:15.010]  Well, I think just the plan that they have for America.
[01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:18.010]  Now, I personally believe it's failing.
[01:27:18.010 --> 01:27:20.010]  And you can bounce.
[01:27:20.010 --> 01:27:22.010]  You can tell me, hey, hey.
[01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:25.010]  I personally feel the plan that they had has failed hopelessly
[01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:29.010]  because 2020 was supposed to totally lock us down
[01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:30.010]  and never open us up.
[01:27:30.010 --> 01:27:31.010]  But here we are.
[01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:32.010]  This is 2023.
[01:27:32.010 --> 01:27:33.010]  This is August.
[01:27:33.010 --> 01:27:37.010]  I'm talking to Alex Jones, and I'm hearing you here.
[01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:39.010]  So that means the plan has failed.
[01:27:39.010 --> 01:27:45.010]  If you and I were bye-bye, then maybe they would have been further down the road.
[01:27:45.010 --> 01:27:49.010]  But it's not just us because there's thousands of other voices
[01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:54.010]  that even if we were not here, others would rise in our place.
[01:27:54.010 --> 01:27:56.010]  People are awake.
[01:27:56.010 --> 01:28:01.010]  Everywhere you go, across California, across Washington State, it doesn't matter.
[01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:04.010]  Even in New York, people are not stupid.
[01:28:04.010 --> 01:28:07.010]  They know what's going on, and they see through everything right now.
[01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:11.010]  So my advice to the globalists, you guys better back off.
[01:28:11.010 --> 01:28:17.010]  You just back off and maybe wait 40 years and just leave it alone for now
[01:28:17.010 --> 01:28:20.010]  because you're not going to get what you want done right at this juncture.
[01:28:20.010 --> 01:28:21.010]  It's failing.
[01:28:21.010 --> 01:28:23.010]  And I know you want to kill the dollar,
[01:28:24.010 --> 01:28:28.010]  but unfortunately you're not able to kill the dollar for several reasons.
[01:28:28.010 --> 01:28:32.010]  Because you have too much committed in the dollar,
[01:28:32.010 --> 01:28:35.010]  and if you do kill the dollar at this juncture,
[01:28:35.010 --> 01:28:37.010]  somebody said, well, they'll change to digital.
[01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:40.010]  There's whole countries that can't even get digital.
[01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:43.010]  There's whole nations that can't even function off of digital.
[01:28:43.010 --> 01:28:45.010]  There's even parts of America that can't function.
[01:28:45.010 --> 01:28:46.010]  That's right.
[01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:47.010]  Pastor Brown, stay there.
[01:28:47.010 --> 01:28:48.010]  They jumped the gun.
[01:28:48.010 --> 01:28:49.010]  We're going to come right back.
[01:28:49.010 --> 01:28:50.010]  Give me the floor.
[01:28:50.010 --> 01:28:51.010]  You are dead on about the ESGs.

[01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:16.010]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:19.010]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds,
[01:31:19.010 --> 01:31:21.010]  are better for different people.

[01:31:58.010 --> 01:31:59.010]  In the early 1900s,
[01:31:59.010 --> 01:32:05.010]  certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[01:32:05.010 --> 01:32:08.010]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:32:08.010 --> 01:32:13.010]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[01:32:13.010 --> 01:32:16.010]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid,
[01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:19.010]  still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:32:19.010 --> 01:32:22.010]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison,
[01:32:22.010 --> 01:32:25.010]  and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[01:32:25.010 --> 01:32:27.010]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders
[01:32:27.010 --> 01:32:30.010]  was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[01:32:30.010 --> 01:32:33.010]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[01:32:33.010 --> 01:32:37.010]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic,
[01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:42.010]  untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:32:42.010 --> 01:32:47.010]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:32:47.010 --> 01:32:51.010]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water,
[01:32:51.010 --> 01:32:53.010]  and a remedy to this madness.
[01:32:53.010 --> 01:32:57.010]  Available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:33:07.820]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:15.430]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:22.430]  You know, everything nowadays is niche audiences.
[01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:28.430]  And so, Rodney Howard Brown reaches tens of millions of people a week, so do we,
[01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:31.430]  but we need to get all those groups together to understand what's happening.
[01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:35.430]  Here's just a quick little prelude video.
[01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:40.430]  We'll go back to Pastor Brown about his big Africa trip that's coming up that is extremely dangerous.
[01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:42.430]  He doesn't make that point, but we are.
[01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:44.430]  Pray for him and pray for his ministry.
[01:33:44.430 --> 01:33:50.430]  He's got hundreds of churches around the world, many of them in Africa, many of them in Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America.
[01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:53.430]  And it really is people need Jesus right now.
[01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:55.430]  That's the answer to this open satanic system.
[01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:56.430]  It's always been the answer.
[01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:58.430]  Here's where he's going in just a few weeks.
[01:33:58.430 --> 01:34:00.430]  We need to pray for Pastor Brown and his team.
[01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:01.430]  Here it is.
[01:34:02.430 --> 01:34:10.430]  It's not by the efforts of one, but by the combined efforts of many.
[01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:14.430]  You're going to reach people that nobody else can reach.
[01:34:14.430 --> 01:34:17.430]  I'm going to mobilize every single person here to win souls.
[01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:20.430]  God preserved you for this moment.
[01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:25.430]  The glory of God is going to run through this land, so much so that it shall shake every realm.
[01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:28.430]  Shaking it to the very core.
[01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:32.430]  And there's nothing the devil can do to stop it.
[01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:36.430]  I come and light a fire and watch it burn.
[01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:38.430]  God's not finished with Africa.
[01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:45.430]  In the divine atmosphere of heaven, the Lord will forge in you that which he wants you to do.
[01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:49.430]  And the grace to carry the mantle will be upon your life.
[01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:52.430]  God has raised you up for this hour.
[01:34:55.430 --> 01:35:00.430]  God has raised you up for this hour.
[01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:09.430]  All right, and there's a longer promo I have where he goes over the 10 countries he's going to.
[01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:13.430]  And I remember a video we played five weeks ago where he said in the 90s,
[01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:20.430]  God's told me there's going to be a great awakening coming in the next few decades to this global New World Order system.
[01:35:20.430 --> 01:35:23.430]  He didn't just start fighting the New World Order five years ago or ten years ago.
[01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:30.430]  Even before I started, he was on air in 93, 92, 94, talking about all this.
[01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:35.430]  So give us 35,000 foot or the million mile view if you'd like, about where we are.
[01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:37.430]  And let's plow through.
[01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:39.430]  Because I can ask a thousand questions, Pastor.
[01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:40.430]  I love you to death.
[01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:44.430]  And you've got Holy Ghost anointing and just great discernment just about where the world is,
[01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:47.430]  what's happening, what we can all do to get ready for what we're about to go through.
[01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:51.430]  There are attempts to crash the dollar, the devaluation of the UST bills.
[01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:52.430]  I mean, big things are happening.
[01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:57.430]  They now admit on CNN, I have the clip, that the Ukrainians have been completely destroyed.
[01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:58.430]  Where does that come next?
[01:35:58.430 --> 01:35:59.430]  Pastor Brown.
[01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:05.430]  I mean, we all know the Ukraine story is a total flop.
[01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:14.430]  I mean, there were pictures yesterday of everybody just chilling out in Kiev, you know, Kiev.
[01:36:14.430 --> 01:36:17.430]  And it looks like they're in the middle of a war.
[01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:23.430]  So the bottom line is, as you know, Russia's been fighting, they've been arguing for years.
[01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:29.430]  This is just a whole ploy, money laundering operation and a weapons laundering operation.
[01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:33.430]  So many of the weapons that went through there, that's why they keep asking for more.
[01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:36.430]  But those weapons that landed went straight in there.
[01:36:36.430 --> 01:36:40.430]  And I'm hearing from African leaders, there's weapons, there's new weapons coming in our country,
[01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:43.430]  coming into Sudan, coming into.
[01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:44.430]  Oh, it's been confirmed.
[01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:45.430]  Al Qaeda's getting them.
[01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:46.430]  Al Qaeda's getting them.
[01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:49.430]  Al Qaeda and the Mexican coyotes are getting them.
[01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:50.430]  That's confirmed.
[01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:52.430]  Yeah.
[01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:55.430]  So, I mean, it's a big laundering operation.
[01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:58.430]  I mean, it's like everything coming out of our country.
[01:36:58.430 --> 01:37:03.430]  It's almost laughable when you think about what's taking place,
[01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:09.430]  because nobody would believe that America could turn this corrupt.
[01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:12.430]  And you can just see everything from the January 6th.
[01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:17.430]  I mean, I was watching Mike Pence, you know, that guy.
[01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:19.430]  What a traitor.
[01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:25.430]  I was watching Mike Pence, just like, you know, he was there with President Trump.
[01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:30.430]  He knows what he was supposed to do was send the electors back and give them two weeks to decide.
[01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:32.430]  That's all Trump asked him to do.
[01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:36.430]  And that was in the law that they were allowed to do that.
[01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:38.430]  And America just had not used that.
[01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:43.430]  But Congress rewrote the law so that the vice president couldn't do that.
[01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:48.430]  So if they rewrote the law, then there must have been something in effect to where he could have done it.
[01:37:48.430 --> 01:37:51.430]  And all he needed to do is say, no, be back in two weeks.
[01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:53.430]  Be back in two weeks.
[01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:58.430]  Because January 6th wasn't the time when the president is sworn in.
[01:37:58.430 --> 01:38:00.430]  He was sworn in weeks later.
[01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:04.430]  So they would have had enough time to go back and make sure that everything was fine.
[01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:06.430]  And they didn't do that.
[01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:09.430]  Now I see that he wants to testify against Trump.
[01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:18.430]  I don't even think Pence will even win dog catcher in some small county in Indiana.
[01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:19.430]  Seriously.
[01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:21.430]  Talk about election meddling.
[01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:24.430]  How do you testify against somebody you're running against?
[01:38:24.430 --> 01:38:28.430]  Since you mentioned it, here's a clip of him a month ago with Tucker Carlson.
[01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:30.430]  Where Tucker says, what about the dying vets?
[01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:31.430]  What about the fentanyl?
[01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:32.430]  What about the collapsing America?
[01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:33.430]  200 billion in Ukraine.
[01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:34.430]  He says, none of my concern.
[01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:35.430]  Here it is.
[01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:41.430]  Every city in the United States has become much worse in the past three years.
[01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:42.430]  Drive around.
[01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:45.430]  There's not one city that's gotten better in the United States.
[01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:46.430]  And it's visible.
[01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:48.430]  Our economy has degraded.
[01:38:48.430 --> 01:38:50.430]  The suicide rate has jumped.
[01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:55.430]  Public filth and disorder and crime have exponentially increased.
[01:38:55.430 --> 01:39:01.430]  And yet your concern is that the Ukrainians, a country most people can't find on a map,
[01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:05.430]  who've received tens of billions of U.S. tax dollars, don't have enough tanks.
[01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:09.430]  I think it's a fair question to ask, where's the concern for the United States in that?
[01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:10.430]  It's not my concern.
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:19.280]  No, it's not my concern. Talk about that arrogance.
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:24.280]  Unbelievable. Did you see what General Killong released a statement about Mike Pence?
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:29.280]  Did you see that? I tweeted this and he wrote this. This is General...
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:32.280]  Let me try to get this thing to go bigger.
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:36.280]  He says, yeah, my statement on Pence. This is General Killong.
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:41.280]  I've worked alongside many leaders in my years of service to this nation.
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:47.280]  Among them, President Donald J. Trump stands apart as a figure of unwavering determination,
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:53.280]  a deep vision for America, and the courage to take a stand where others wilt.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:40:00.280]  His bold and dramatic leadership style during his presidency resulted in significant achievements for our country,
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:04.280]  which Nancy Pelosi says if he wins again, America will cease to exist.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:08.280]  Right, Nancy, there's a home waiting for you. Your room is ready.
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:15.280]  Anyway, for a period of time in the White House, I served as national security advisor to Vice President Pence.
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:18.280]  While I respect his service to the nation,
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:23.280]  I must express my disappointment in his recent actions regarding President Trump.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:29.280]  He's not the decisive leadership that we've seen from President Trump,
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:34.280]  where President Trump is bold and unafraid to challenge the status quo.
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:39.280]  Pence has often chosen the passive route, avoiding confrontation.
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:48.280]  This lack of assertiveness combined with overall reliance on failed political consultants,
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:57.280]  which that's terrible, like Matt Short, has determined a liaise fair leadership style of unworthy of the presidency.
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:05.280]  While President Trump has constantly put America first, prioritizing our citizens, our economy, and a global standing,
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:11.280]  Pence's actions have often seemed more focused on political maneuvering and maintaining his image.
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:14.280]  That is not what Republican voters want.
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:22.280]  President Trump's dedication to the prosperity and security of the United States is unwavering, as is his vision for the future.
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:27.280]  I believe in the future of President Trump's envision, a future that demands bold and decisive leadership,
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:33.280]  something we have seen President Trump, but not from former Vice President Pence.
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:36.280]  So, I mean, that's like, boom, there it goes.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:39.280]  And now I'm watching, and I love our governor.
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:43.280]  I mean, thank God for Governor Ron Sanchez here in Florida.
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:46.280]  But now he's like totally gone.
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:51.280]  You would think Ron and Pence were friends the way they talk about everything.
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:55.280]  Pence says, I will testify against Donald Trump.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:58.280]  Really? How do you even do that?
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:02.280]  So what's he trying to do, position himself as if he thinks now Democrats are going to vote for him?
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:05.280]  They don't like Pence, because Pence is against abortion.
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:07.280]  Pence is against abortion.
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:10.280]  He's against homosexuality or the gay movement.
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:17.280]  So now you think that Democrats are going to jump the fence and now vote for you?
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:20.280]  Nah, you will always be known as a traitor.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:25.280]  From now to the time you die, you'll be known as a traitor.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:28.280]  A Benedict Arnold, a traitor.
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:30.280]  That's it.
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:37.280]  And then, as I said, when you were with me, I think now seven weeks ago, probably seven or eight,
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:39.280]  and we talked about it at length.
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:44.280]  Our governor needs to just step this one out, which I mean, I don't think he's showing anything in the polls,
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:50.280]  and wait to 2028, if there's anything there for him to run for.
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:55.280]  Because I'm just promising you right now, if they get what they want,
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:59.280]  if Biden, somebody says, well, Biden's not good to run.
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:04.280]  If they put Kamala in, or they bring Big Mike back,
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:09.280]  you know, I mean, who knows what they're going to do with this thing.
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:10.280]  You have no clue.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:12.280]  But they don't really care.
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:16.280]  You know, Klaus Schwab says, we're coming to a time when we're not going to have elections anymore.
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:20.280]  We'll just know who's supposed to be there and who's supposed to be in power.
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:21.280]  Well, that's not how America works.
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:23.280]  And by the way, since you mentioned that, it's too powerful.
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:27.280]  Since you mentioned it's too powerful, guys, I played it last Friday.
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:33.280]  Get Klaus Schwab saying he was talking to Sergey Brin of Google, the co-founder,
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:35.280]  and Sergey Brin's nodding.
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:37.280]  We're just not going to have elections now.
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:39.280]  AI will decide how you're going to vote and tell you.
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.280]  I mean, it's a total borg, give up, we're going to roll over you.
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:48.280]  While they get that clip, what do you make of Jack Smith and this January 6th indictment?
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:52.280]  I mean, and Trump is, like, tripled down, quadrupled down.
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:55.280]  He is just totally annihilating them.
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:56.280]  They're trying to gag him.
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:01.280]  Spirit level, gut level, not even temporal, not even as a human's great analysis.
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:06.280]  What does the Holy Spirit tell you right now, first response, which we always know is the best,
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:08.280]  from the Holy Spirit, what's going to happen to Trump?
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:09.280]  What's going to happen to Trump?
[01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:15.420]  I mean, I don't know what's going to happen with Georgia, because Georgia might be a little
[01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:20.019]  different because they want to even do a mug shot with Georgia when he goes to, when they
[01:44:20.019 --> 01:44:22.780]  indict him, his fourth indictment.
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:25.940]  When they indict him for the fourth time, he has to go there and they want to do a mug
[01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:26.940]  shot fingerprint.
[01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:30.460]  So, obviously, it's going to be a little different than what just happened.
[01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:34.780]  Pelosi says that when he landed in D.C. that he was a scared puppy.
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:35.780]  I saw the footage.
[01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:37.220]  He didn't look scared to me.
[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:42.340]  He was actually at Bedminster playing golf with some friends of mine just before he
[01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:43.340]  threw down.
[01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:46.139]  Well, Roger Stone, he says Trump is, he's known him 45 years.
[01:44:46.139 --> 01:44:48.380]  He says Trump is supercharged.
[01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:49.580]  Trump is not a scared puppy.
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:50.580]  Yeah.
[01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:51.580]  Okay.
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:55.500]  I was supposed to be at Bedminster that day, but I couldn't, Alex, we're getting everything
[01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:56.500]  ready.
[01:44:56.500 --> 01:44:57.500]  There's so much happening.
[01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:58.500]  The university just opened this week.
[01:44:58.500 --> 01:44:59.500]  And it's just too much happening.
[01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:00.500]  Yeah, I was there with you when you took the call.
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:01.500]  I couldn't go.
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:02.500]  I got invited by Trump to there.
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:04.980]  You see, you couldn't go.
[01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:05.980]  Yeah.
[01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:13.660]  So the bottom line is, I think this January the 6th, the thing filed by our friend there,
[01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:16.980]  not our friend, but our friend in D.C., I think it's all going to fail.
[01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:20.059]  I think when it goes to the Supreme Court, they have to throw it out.
[01:45:20.059 --> 01:45:21.300]  There's nothing there.
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:23.580]  So basically, it's all bogus.
[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:25.139]  I'm not sure about the Georgia thing.
[01:45:25.139 --> 01:45:27.620]  I don't know what's going to happen with the Georgia deal.
[01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:35.420]  But nonetheless, January the 6th was based on misinformation that Russia was rushing
[01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:36.420]  collusion.
[01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:37.820]  That's all been proven.
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:42.900]  So therefore, if that's all been proven, then January 6th should be null and void at this
[01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:43.980]  juncture.
[01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:49.220]  And just Trump, they already decided that Trump didn't try to overthrow the government.
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:54.900]  So how has he been charged for something that has already been decided that he didn't do?
[01:45:54.900 --> 01:46:01.580]  So it's all just a kabuki theater to continue doing what they want to do to try to stop
[01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:02.580]  him.
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:03.580]  But he's going up in the polls.
[01:46:03.580 --> 01:46:06.980]  The crowds are growing, even though they don't like to admit it.
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:09.260]  But people are tired of this nonsense.
[01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:10.900]  And you know, America's for the underdog.
[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:11.900]  But you just said it.
[01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:13.179]  They're so stupid.
[01:46:13.179 --> 01:46:17.460]  The worst thing they could do in Georgia is perp walk him or hold him in jail.
[01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:18.460]  Why don't why?
[01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:19.460]  Why doesn't the devil?
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:20.460]  I asked you this.
[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:24.019]  We were having dinner with you and my wife and my wife, your wife, my wife.
[01:46:24.139 --> 01:46:25.139]  And I said, why does the devil?
[01:46:25.139 --> 01:46:28.300]  We were talking about prominent people that have been under demonic attack who weren't
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:29.940]  even Christians now made him Christian.
[01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:31.980]  And you said the devil's kind of stupid.
[01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:33.660]  He is not omnipresent.
[01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:37.860]  He'll just explain that, because, I mean, you and I aren't that smart compared to God
[01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:38.860]  or nothing.
[01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:40.220]  But we're way smarter than globalists.
[01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:46.099]  Don't they get that if they perp walk him and mugshot him, that he goes up 10 more points?
[01:46:46.099 --> 01:46:47.099]  I mean, I could.
[01:46:47.099 --> 01:46:48.099]  That's easy to say.
[01:46:48.099 --> 01:46:49.099]  Look, who knows?
[01:46:49.099 --> 01:46:50.099]  Look, I just know they frantic.
[01:46:50.099 --> 01:46:51.099]  So when you frantic, you do crazy stuff.
[01:46:51.099 --> 01:46:52.099]  And the problem that we have is a legal system that's corrupted that lawyers would even file
[01:46:52.099 --> 01:46:53.099]  frivolous lawsuit, but based on nothing that that any person with any intelligence would
[01:46:53.099 --> 01:46:54.099]  say, this is out of court.
[01:46:54.099 --> 01:46:55.099]  This is based on nothing.
[01:46:55.099 --> 01:46:56.099]  There's nothing here.
[01:46:56.099 --> 01:46:57.099]  Throw it out.
[01:46:57.099 --> 01:46:58.099]  And I mean, you know, how do you know that?
[01:46:58.099 --> 01:46:59.099]  How do you know that?
[01:46:59.099 --> 01:47:00.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:00.099 --> 01:47:01.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:01.099 --> 01:47:02.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:02.099 --> 01:47:03.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:03.099 --> 01:47:04.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:04.099 --> 01:47:05.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:05.099 --> 01:47:06.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:06.099 --> 01:47:07.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:07.099 --> 01:47:08.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:08.099 --> 01:47:09.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:09.099 --> 01:47:10.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:10.099 --> 01:47:11.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:11.099 --> 01:47:12.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:12.099 --> 01:47:13.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:13.099 --> 01:47:14.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:14.099 --> 01:47:15.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:15.099 --> 01:47:16.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:16.099 --> 01:47:17.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:17.099 --> 01:47:18.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:18.099 --> 01:47:19.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:19.099 --> 01:47:20.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:20.099 --> 01:47:21.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:21.099 --> 01:47:22.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:22.099 --> 01:47:23.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:23.099 --> 01:47:24.099]  How do you know that?
[01:47:24.099 --> 01:47:25.099]  How do you know that?

[01:48:21.099 --> 01:48:22.099]  How do you know that?
[01:48:22.099 --> 01:48:23.099]  How do you know that?
[01:48:23.099 --> 01:48:24.099]  How do you know that?
[01:48:24.099 --> 01:48:25.099]  How do you know that?
[01:48:25.099 --> 01:48:26.099]  How do you know that?
[01:48:26.099 --> 01:48:27.099]  How do you know that?
[01:48:27.099 --> 01:48:28.099]  How do you know that?
[01:48:28.099 --> 01:48:29.099]  How do you know that?
[01:48:29.099 --> 01:48:30.099]  How do you know that?
[01:48:30.099 --> 01:48:31.099]  How do you know that?
[01:48:31.099 --> 01:48:32.099]  How do you know that?
[01:48:32.099 --> 01:48:33.099]  How do you know that?
[01:48:33.099 --> 01:48:34.099]  I want you to get back to that in a moment.
[01:48:34.099 --> 01:48:36.580]  But since you mentioned it, I want to back up everything you're saying.
[01:48:36.580 --> 01:48:42.780]  Here is Klaus Schwab a few weeks ago saying, we're going to have AI decide elections.
[01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:46.099]  This predictive system, it'll tell you what you were going to vote.
[01:48:46.099 --> 01:48:49.900]  I mean, talk about a snow job, talk about gaslighting.
[01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:52.139]  That sounds insane to the listeners.
[01:48:52.139 --> 01:48:53.139]  It's true though.
[01:48:53.139 --> 01:48:54.139]  Patrick Brown's right.
[01:48:54.139 --> 01:48:55.820]  So I want to back you up because this is so crazy.
[01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:56.820]  Here it is.
[01:48:57.300 --> 01:49:04.580]  So technology now is, and digital technologies mainly have an analytical power.
[01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:10.780]  Now we go into a predictive power and we have seen the first examples and your company
[01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:13.340]  very much involved into it.
[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:22.540]  But since the next step could be to go into a prescriptive mode, which means you do not
[01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:29.460]  even have to have elections anymore because you can already predict what predict and
[01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:32.860]  afterwards you can say, why do we need elections?
[01:49:32.860 --> 01:49:35.460]  Because we know what the result will be.
[01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:40.099]  Can you imagine such a world?
[01:49:40.099 --> 01:49:45.180]  So Professor Epstein, three years ago before the 2020 election, not Jeffrey Epstein, different
[01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:50.680]  top computer scientist said, Google itself can steal elections, 30, 40 points swing by
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:53.840]  not letting you see conservatives, their ideas are blocking them.
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:54.840]  They did that.
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:58.040]  So the meddling is not letting us have the Hunter Biden laptop.
[01:49:58.040 --> 01:49:59.800]  That's emblematic of thousands of things.
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:05.800]  They did blocking 50 million posts on Facebook talking about COVID being a liar, the shots
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:08.940]  being a liar, the therapeutics being suppressed.
[01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:11.680]  So here they are out of one side of their mouth.
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:12.920]  We don't need elections anymore.
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:18.000]  And now the other side of their mouth, if you question election, you're a terrorist.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:23.639]  This doesn't seem to be working with the people, Pastor Brown.
[01:50:23.639 --> 01:50:25.040]  People are not buying it.
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:29.960]  And that last clip we played where Biden was speaking in his inauguration, Pence was sitting
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:30.960]  there.
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:34.160]  Remember, Pence went that day and said he felt that he should go there.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:37.480]  If you just let it go on, you'll see the back of his head.
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:40.639]  It's a wonder he didn't have a fly on that day.
[01:50:40.639 --> 01:50:45.599]  So Pence went, he went to that, he went to that inauguration.
[01:50:45.599 --> 01:50:51.960]  So it would seem to me, and let me just say this, when I remember, do you remember when
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:56.599]  I broke the story of how they wanted to kill the president and that thing went viral?
[01:50:56.599 --> 01:51:01.200]  And I was walking in the Congress and I met with one of the top congressmen and he said
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:03.080]  they're going to they're going to stroke the president now.
[01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:04.080]  I said, what do you mean?
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:08.800]  They said he's going to have a stroke and Mike Pence will be president and Paul Ryan
[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:10.639]  will be vice president.
[01:51:10.639 --> 01:51:18.099]  And that was all that was the talk on the Hill 2017 by Republican members of Congress
[01:51:18.099 --> 01:51:25.400]  that told me to my face, they said the bill, the health bill that they said was Trump's
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:27.840]  was actually Paul Ryan's bill that was written.
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:32.840]  So, I mean, unfortunately, I went, I walked behind the scenes, I talked to people behind
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:36.320]  the scenes and they just said there were many of the congressmen that were trying to get
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:37.320]  to Trump.
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:41.519]  And many of the people around Trump were blocking Trump from ever hearing what was actually
[01:51:41.519 --> 01:51:42.519]  going on in Congress.
[01:51:42.519 --> 01:51:43.519]  Let me back you up.
[01:51:43.519 --> 01:51:48.880]  At that, at that same time, Brennan and Clapper and a bunch of them had a press conference
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:53.760]  on C-SPAN and they said, he'll be going to be president and they said, you mean impeachment?
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:54.760]  They said, no.
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:56.320]  And they meant, you meant assassination?
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:57.599]  They just started laughing.
[01:51:57.599 --> 01:51:58.800]  So they were trying it then.
[01:51:59.870 --> 01:52:04.870]  Yeah, and you know people don't know there were 27 attempts on Trump's life.
[01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:10.870]  27 attempts on his life. And that's why when you see him stop at a burger joint
[01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:14.870]  or a pizza place, it's not because he just loves junk food.
[01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:18.870]  Trump actually likes elegant things.
[01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:21.870]  But there was a reason why he stopped at a burger place.
[01:52:21.870 --> 01:52:25.870]  Because he knew no one knew he was going to stop at that burger place.
[01:52:25.870 --> 01:52:29.870]  It's funny you say that. I was told by high level Secret Service that Trump said that.
[01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:34.870]  He would send minor aides out to not tell them who he was for.
[01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:37.870]  And that's why he would just eat from local restaurants and fast food
[01:52:37.870 --> 01:52:40.870]  because he couldn't trust the food.
[01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:42.870]  Okay, so here's what happened.
[01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:43.870]  I mean, people have told me this.
[01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:46.870]  So they're bringing in a tray full of burgers.
[01:52:46.870 --> 01:52:51.870]  And then say Mike Pompeo would pick up a burger and about to eat it,
[01:52:51.870 --> 01:52:54.870]  Trump would grab that from Pompeo.
[01:52:55.870 --> 01:53:01.870]  He would grab that and eat Pompeo's burger because he knew that that burger was safe.
[01:53:01.870 --> 01:53:02.870]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:04.870]  So Trump's not stupid.
[01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:05.870]  And that's not funny.
[01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:09.870]  The whole history, they'd have poison tasters, the royal families.
[01:53:09.870 --> 01:53:12.870]  The media makes a joke when I say Trump will be assassinated.
[01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:13.870]  Why does he have Secret Service?
[01:53:13.870 --> 01:53:15.870]  Obviously, and that's my next concern.
[01:53:15.870 --> 01:53:16.870]  What does your spirit tell you?
[01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:17.870]  What's the Holy Ghost tell you?
[01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:19.870]  He's going to win.
[01:53:19.870 --> 01:53:21.870]  He's going to pardon himself.
[01:53:21.870 --> 01:53:23.870]  Their next move is assassination.
[01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:24.870]  We're going to try it.
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:31.000]  Yeah, I mean, I have not even probed that side of things. I mean, because, you know,
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:35.240]  I had that open vision where the Lord told me he didn't care who was in the White House and who was
[01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:42.280]  in this agency. I mean, obviously, out of everybody, I like Trump. I didn't agree with him
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:48.360]  on anything on the vaccination. So that's where he lost me. I stopped watching his rhetoric with
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:55.880]  him and Fauci and the lady with the scarf, what's her name, Burke. And so I just couldn't tolerate
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:54:01.240]  that. And Mike Pence, basically, when Trump made Pence the head of COVID commission, he should let
[01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:10.120]  him, if Trump had never been seen, let Pence hang himself with daily reports. Pence would have hung
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:16.920]  himself publicly. But Trump kept coming in there. So he became the face of COVID when he should have
[01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:23.160]  let Pence become the face of COVID. But and that's unfortunate, obviously. And this, you know,
[01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:28.920]  that's one thing that I just took. I can't get over. And it still bothers me immensely because
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:34.200]  But there's no doubt the system is after Trump now. Why are they, Pastor, why are they so scared of Trump?
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:40.839]  Because they know that he's dismantling or was dismantling everything that they were doing.
[01:54:40.839 --> 01:54:44.519]  And the problem is when you get a leader that speaks openly,
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:50.839]  plainly, in the language of the people, the people love that. When a leader gets up and talks,
[01:54:52.839 --> 01:54:57.639]  not what the people want to hear, but what he's being told from the teleprompter.
[01:54:58.679 --> 01:55:02.440]  I mean, I just saw the tweet from Hillary Clinton. It just said, yeah,
[01:55:04.839 --> 01:55:12.519]  Bidenomics, Bidenomics at work. And then she lists all these things that Bidenomics has done.
[01:55:12.519 --> 01:55:17.480]  I mean, this was just tweeted just shortly. Hillary Clinton, if I can find it for you. I mean,
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:23.320]  this is the lies. This is what's being pushed. And everybody just believes it. And mainstream
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:28.360]  media, of course, carries it. I'm not able to find that tweet right now. But it's Hillary Clinton.
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:33.719]  Well, Pastor, we've only got a few minutes left. If you can, I know you're on a roller coaster
[01:55:33.719 --> 01:55:38.599]  thing in Africa. But anytime you've got a good connection, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes,
[01:55:38.599 --> 01:55:42.599]  five hours, if you got it, I really want you to report for us from Africa.
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:47.080]  Revival.com, Revival.com. We've only got about two minutes.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.240]  Well, let me tell you what I've just done. I've just got the whole broadcast thing to carry with
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:59.960]  me to broadcast from whichever country I'm in and to go live. So I'll have my team contact your team
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:05.240]  and say we've got a good connection and that we can come on live. Now, obviously, we're going to
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:10.120]  we're in the spirit right now. So, sir, you command my show. I love you so much. And you're
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:15.480]  doing such a great job. Anytime we can tape it, we can do it live. Anytime you've got to dispatch
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:20.920]  to America, do it. Obviously, Revival.com, your great church. But anytime you're ready, you call
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:25.160]  us with just an hour or so notice whether we're live or not live or you can send us reports and
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:32.280]  we will air it here. OK, OK. And listen, Alex, as you know, we tell people all the time it's time
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:37.160]  for people to get their heart right with the Lord and invite Jesus into their life because
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:43.160]  time is short. We live in the last days. As you read the scripture, Jesus is coming very,
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:48.599]  very soon. And somebody said, I don't believe that. Well, your life could end today and then
[01:56:48.599 --> 01:56:53.799]  he would have come for you basically. So if you don't know Jesus right now, just invite him
[01:56:53.799 --> 01:56:59.400]  into your heart to say, dear Lord Jesus, forgive me of my sin. Wash me in your blood. Cleanse me
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:05.160]  now. From this day, I will serve you. And from this day, I will follow you and obey you. Amen.
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:11.080]  Thank you now for saving me. If you pray that prayer, that's it. And we'll help you. You can
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:15.400]  go to Revival.com. We'll send you a free book all about Jesus that will help you. And Alex,
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:22.040]  you're doing a great job. And I see it's like the Lord's moving some big other things around you
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:28.599]  now. I'm quite excited about what I see. I am, too. I love you, pastor. I love you so much.
[01:57:28.599 --> 01:57:33.880]  Revival.com. And please, I know you're busy, but please come on from Africa. We love you.
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:39.480]  We appreciate you and your whole crew. We'll make it a priority. I'll come to you live from
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:44.040]  Johannesburg. But you can mark that down and then some of the other places.
[01:57:44.759 --> 01:57:46.280]  Thank you, sir. We'll talk to you soon.
[01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:54.510]  Tell us about the products, how we support you, how we support all of ourselves and the big event coming up.
[01:57:54.510 --> 01:58:00.510]  Well, yeah, let's, the first one, you obviously can go to MyPillow.com, use that promo code Alex,
[01:58:00.510 --> 01:58:06.510]  and you can get all these great discounts on all of our products, and just by visiting this site,
[01:58:06.510 --> 01:58:09.510]  you're going to get a $20 free gift emailed to you immediately.
[01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:14.510]  And there's the biggest special we have right now, the 20 year anniversary MyPillow,
[01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:18.510]  for 1998 for the queen size, normally $69.98.
[01:58:18.510 --> 01:58:25.510]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love doing best, producing and making the MyPillow.
[01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:30.510]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how,
[01:58:30.510 --> 01:58:35.510]  using the money for Americana freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:38.510]  That's what the debanking is about. That's what the financial attacks are about.
[01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:42.510]  That's why we've got a rush to support MyPillow.com and InfoWars.com,
[01:58:42.510 --> 01:58:46.510]  plus their great products in both places, because we are the tip of the spear.
[01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:54.510]  We finally have our original best-selling colloidal silver back in stock.
[01:58:54.510 --> 01:58:58.510]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy,
[01:58:58.510 --> 01:59:04.510]  we could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:08.510]  But now we've got it 30 parts per million from the top lab.
[01:59:08.510 --> 01:59:11.510]  We've got a limited shipment. Hopefully we'll have a lot of it in the future.
[01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:17.510]  But if you want to experience and have in your medicine cabinet, have in your preparedness arsenal,
[01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:20.510]  high-quality colloidal silver from the best manufacturer,
[01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:26.510]  we have it right now private-labeled under the name SilverBullet at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:31.510]  Limited supply, 30% off, InfoWarsStore.com, SilverBullet.
[01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:38.510]  Research colloidal silver, find out what a game-changer it is, and then get yours at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:39.510 --> 01:59:44.510]  SilverBullet, back in stock, 30% off, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:51.510 --> 01:59:56.510]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:56.510 --> 02:00:16.510]  I respect China's achievements, which are tremendous over the last, over 40 years.
[02:00:16.510 --> 02:00:22.510]  The Chinese model is certainly a very attractive model for quite a number of countries.
[02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:28.510]  Real super hardcore evil demons have taken over, and they've already got China and a billion and a half people.
[02:00:28.510 --> 02:00:35.510]  I'm here to meet one of the 10 million people who've seen the dark side of the social credit system.
[02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:42.510]  Investigative journalist Leo Hu, his poor social credit rating has shut down his travel options
[02:00:42.510 --> 02:00:46.510]  and confined him to effective house arrest in Chongqing.
[02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:48.510]  WeChat started as a messaging app.
[02:00:49.510 --> 02:00:54.510]  Then it transformed into Chinese Facebook, and then it added a ride-hailing service similar to Uber to its platform.
[02:00:54.510 --> 02:00:58.510]  And then it added banking services to its platform, and now you can use it as an ID.
[02:00:58.510 --> 02:01:04.510]  This will make your life very convenient, but at the same time, it also becomes very convenient for state security to track you.
[02:01:04.510 --> 02:01:07.510]  To combat message interceptions, they talk through emojis.
[02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:10.510]  A half-fallen rose means someone has been arrested.
[02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:12.510]  A dark moon means they're going to prison camps.
[02:01:12.510 --> 02:01:16.510]  A sun emoji means they are alive, and a flower means they have been released.
[02:01:16.510 --> 02:01:21.510]  China is positioning itself to lead the world in artificial intelligence.
[02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:25.510]  Surveillance technology is a key proving ground.
[02:01:25.510 --> 02:01:33.510]  Facial recognition, body scanning, and geo-tracking, matched with your personal data and online behavior,
[02:01:33.510 --> 02:01:39.510]  will power the social credit system, leaving no dark corner to hide in.
[02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:43.510]  And you can say, well, this is just innovation, but it's not innovation the way it's being done.
[02:01:43.510 --> 02:01:47.510]  It's absolute tyranny, and now it's here, and guess who created the bill?
[02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:54.510]  Senator Blumenthal, who cornerbacks the government operations against me on record with the Carnegie Endowment and the CIA.
[02:01:54.510 --> 02:02:03.510]  This bill is designed to make sure that they have your home address before you can actually post about anything on the Internet.
[02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:06.510]  The bill is Senate Bill 1409.
[02:02:06.510 --> 02:02:09.510]  Forty senators have sponsored it, Republicans and Democrats.
[02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:11.510]  This isn't a left or right issue.
[02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:17.510]  This is a speech issue, and they call the bill the Kids Online Safety Act, or COSA for short.
[02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:22.510]  But in reality, this is some garbage to make sure that they know where you live when you post.
[02:02:22.510 --> 02:02:29.510]  Whether you're a conservative or a liberal or whatever you are, there are so many people going along with the New World Order
[02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:36.510]  who even know it's real, but they think, well, I'll just go along with it, and I'll have a better lifestyle if I go along with it. No.
[02:02:36.510 --> 02:02:42.510]  Because we see what is happening in China right now with the social credit score, where the government is monitoring
[02:02:42.510 --> 02:02:45.510]  and surveilling all the people from the beginning to end.
[02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:52.510]  Everything that they do, everything, everywhere where they walk, you know, they control everything and they watch everything.
[02:02:52.510 --> 02:02:54.510]  This is the example of a tyranny.
[02:02:54.510 --> 02:03:00.510]  When the government knows everything about you, where you go, what you eat, where you enter, that's a tyrannical system.
[02:03:00.510 --> 02:03:05.510]  And we've seen this system being implemented right now under the leadership of Ursula von der Leyen,
[02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:08.510]  slowly but surely in the European Union.
[02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:10.510]  The green certificate was just the first step.
[02:03:10.510 --> 02:03:14.510]  There are a few more proposals right now under debate in the parliament.
[02:03:14.510 --> 02:03:23.510]  All these things that are creating a system that will monitor, control, supervise, and condition the rights of all the European citizens.
[02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:28.510]  The heart of the Mark of the Beast system is a worldwide Internet ID.
[02:03:28.510 --> 02:03:30.510]  The UN's already standardized it.
[02:03:30.510 --> 02:03:32.510]  Communist China standardized it.
[02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:40.510]  And it's the Internet ID that's tied to your smartphone, your smart devices, your car, your ability to get on airplanes, get hotels, have insurance, have a job.
[02:03:40.510 --> 02:03:49.510]  And then that's tied to your carbon tax, your vaccine passport tax that operates and gets its orders from your social credit score.
[02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:58.510]  The foundation and the structure of the entire system is based on the Internet ID that is then tied to your digital ID.
[02:03:58.510 --> 02:04:04.510]  Jeff Bezos' Amazon-owned Whole Foods is announcing worldwide in the next three months,
[02:04:04.510 --> 02:04:07.510]  they're putting palm scanners in to be able to buy and sell.
[02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:10.510]  And in many Whole Foods and other grocery stores in Europe,
[02:04:10.510 --> 02:04:15.510]  they're already making you scan your phone or your hand to get into the grocery stores,
[02:04:16.510 --> 02:04:19.510]  not just Whole Paycheck as Whole Foods is known.
[02:04:24.510 --> 02:04:26.510]  So this is already being set up for a long time.
[02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:29.510]  Now they're getting ready to go, oh, you didn't know?
[02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:33.510]  Under law, there's a whole history of what you search and what you do and where you go.
[02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:38.510]  We're talking about a republic that we're losing and it's being destroyed by design.
[02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:42.510]  And now global corporations think we're a bunch of dumb animals.
[02:04:42.510 --> 02:04:46.510]  And they'll incentivize accepting the world government, cashless society,
[02:04:46.510 --> 02:04:51.510]  programmable central bank digital currencies and ESGs and the rest of them
[02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:57.510]  because we get little credits and little prizes up front to be the first suckers to grease this.
[02:04:58.510 --> 02:05:03.510]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the answer.
[02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:07.510]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil,
[02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:10.510]  the incredible things it does for your nerves, your brain,
[02:05:10.510 --> 02:05:14.510]  your entire physiological system for your nervous system particularly.
[02:05:14.510 --> 02:05:16.510]  Everybody knows it's incredible it works.
[02:05:16.510 --> 02:05:21.510]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:28.510]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more because that's who we're getting it from.
[02:05:28.510 --> 02:05:30.510]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[02:05:30.510 --> 02:05:34.510]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:40.510]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[02:05:40.510 --> 02:05:43.510]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:47.510]  And here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:50.510]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:54.510]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[02:05:54.510 --> 02:05:58.510]  Rebel Zen, get yours at InfoWareStore.com now.
[02:06:04.510 --> 02:06:09.510]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:16.510]  Listen to me carefully and listen good.
[02:06:16.510 --> 02:06:18.510]  We're all in this together.
[02:06:18.510 --> 02:06:21.510]  Two key words, Alpha Gal.
[02:06:21.510 --> 02:06:26.510]  Write it down, put it on your refrigerator door as George Trait would say.
[02:06:26.510 --> 02:06:28.510]  Alpha Gal.
[02:06:28.510 --> 02:06:31.510]  Alpha Gal.
[02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:33.510]  Let me say it five more times.
[02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:38.510]  Alpha Gal.
[02:06:38.510 --> 02:06:39.510]  Five more times.
[02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:43.510]  Alpha Gal.
[02:06:43.510 --> 02:06:44.510]  Let me say it 10 more times.
[02:06:44.510 --> 02:06:51.510]  Alpha Gal.
[02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:59.510]  My greatest frustration is that I can talk to the public in the streets of the grocery store
[02:06:59.510 --> 02:07:04.510]  or at the gym or at church or at an airport.
[02:07:04.510 --> 02:07:06.510]  And they say, oh my gosh, you predicted everything.
[02:07:06.510 --> 02:07:07.510]  It's incredible.
[02:07:07.510 --> 02:07:10.510]  I can have Tucker Carlson, not named dropping, call me.
[02:07:10.510 --> 02:07:12.510]  Joe Rogan, have dinner with him Saturday.
[02:07:12.510 --> 02:07:14.510]  Oh my God, you're right about everything.
[02:07:14.510 --> 02:07:17.510]  And when I looked at Joe, I said, we're eating steaks at Eddie V's.
[02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:21.510]  I said, listen, what I really want to do is tell you the next thing that's coming to stop it.
[02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:24.510]  I don't want to tell you what's coming next and then have it happen.
[02:07:24.510 --> 02:07:26.510]  Oh my gosh, this guy knows everything.
[02:07:26.510 --> 02:07:29.510]  Enemy tells you what they're going to do.
[02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:35.510]  So when I say Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal,
[02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:37.510]  I'm not trying to be obnoxious.
[02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:41.510]  I want you to write it down and put it on your refrigerator door.
[02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:44.510]  That's how we say it in Texas.
[02:07:44.510 --> 02:07:47.510]  Your refrigerator door.
[02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:50.510]  Because they say you're not going to eat meat anymore.
[02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:53.510]  It's all over the news.
[02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:55.510]  Everywhere.
[02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:58.510]  Suddenly all these people can't eat meat.
[02:07:58.510 --> 02:08:00.510]  I talked about this a few weeks ago.
[02:08:00.510 --> 02:08:04.510]  The crew was like, oh, my mom, my dad, my brother, my sister, my cousin can't eat meat anymore.
[02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:05.510]  Can't eat beef anymore.
[02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:07.510]  They get violently allergic.
[02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:08.510]  Mouth swells up.
[02:08:08.510 --> 02:08:10.510]  Eyes swell up like a beast on them.
[02:08:10.510 --> 02:08:14.510]  And then when I talked about it yesterday and filed our first big report on it with documents,
[02:08:14.510 --> 02:08:16.510]  I told you it was coming.
[02:08:16.510 --> 02:08:18.510]  Flooded on Twitter.
[02:08:18.510 --> 02:08:19.510]  Millions of views.
[02:08:19.510 --> 02:08:21.510]  Flooded it in full force with emails.
[02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:24.510]  Flooded with calls going by the crew.
[02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:28.510]  I mean, we have six people in the control room.
[02:08:28.510 --> 02:08:29.510]  Six people.
[02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:33.510]  Three of them have family members can't eat meat after taking the Pfizer shot.
[02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:34.510]  Or Moderna.
[02:08:34.510 --> 02:08:38.510]  Which when we have studies showing you take that, it triggers the alpha-gal in you.
[02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:43.510]  That a bunch of vaccines have the alpha-gal triggering protein crystal in it.
[02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:45.510]  But we're not going to just tell you that.
[02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:46.510]  Like, oh, what are you, a scientist?
[02:08:46.510 --> 02:08:48.510]  No, I just read the scientist reports.
[02:08:48.510 --> 02:08:50.510]  This is what's going on.
[02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:51.510]  And they tell you all over the news.
[02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:52.510]  Everywhere.
[02:08:52.510 --> 02:08:56.510]  About a month ago, Scott and Thomas, two of the producers, came in.
[02:08:56.510 --> 02:08:59.510]  They said, hey, they're saying this tick does it.
[02:08:59.510 --> 02:09:02.510]  But the tick is even in areas of the country.
[02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:04.510]  It's only like half the country.
[02:09:04.510 --> 02:09:07.510]  To the south, to Texas.
[02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:08.510]  It's up in the east coast.
[02:09:08.510 --> 02:09:10.510]  But it's not in like half the country.
[02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:12.510]  They're getting alpha-gal.
[02:09:12.510 --> 02:09:13.510]  They're getting where they can.
[02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:15.510]  They've been bit by a tick.
[02:09:15.510 --> 02:09:18.510]  Like they said, oh, LeBron James' son had a heart attack.
[02:09:18.510 --> 02:09:21.510]  And everybody's having problems from COVID.
[02:09:21.510 --> 02:09:23.510]  And the shot protected him.
[02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:24.510]  They don't have proof it's COVID.
[02:09:24.510 --> 02:09:25.510]  They say, well, we think it's COVID.
[02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:27.510]  It's not because you took a shot.
[02:09:27.510 --> 02:09:29.510]  Those statistics show those that took the shot, you know,
[02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:33.510]  or had myocarditis and all the other problems.
[02:09:33.510 --> 02:09:35.510]  So this is a big deal.
[02:09:35.510 --> 02:09:37.510]  So we're here to give you tomorrow's news today.
[02:09:37.510 --> 02:09:39.510]  This has already begun.
[02:09:39.510 --> 02:09:41.510]  We put out a big report yesterday.
[02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:43.510]  And enlisters didn't seem to get it.
[02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:47.510]  There are studies saying the COVID shot triggers the protein in you.
[02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:50.510]  But a bunch of so-called vaccines they've been given actually cause it.
[02:09:50.510 --> 02:09:53.510]  So there's no debate that a bunch of people,
[02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:56.510]  according to the CDC and the FDA's own websites,
[02:09:56.510 --> 02:09:58.510]  we're going to put on screen for you.
[02:09:58.510 --> 02:10:00.510]  Say it again.
[02:10:00.510 --> 02:10:02.510]  They admit, kind of like in October of 2000,
[02:10:02.510 --> 02:10:05.510]  before any shots were given, they said it'll cause myocarditis, strokes,
[02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:07.510]  heart attacks, blood clots, blah, blah, blah.
[02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:09.510]  Infertility.
[02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:10.510]  They know.
[02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:11.510]  It's the same thing.
[02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:12.510]  So they're telling you a tick's doing this.
[02:10:12.510 --> 02:10:14.510]  People are like, well, I didn't bat in the woods.
[02:10:14.510 --> 02:10:15.510]  I haven't been to the park.
[02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:17.510]  Why the hell can I not eat beef now?
[02:10:17.510 --> 02:10:19.510]  Oh, I took a shot.
[02:10:20.510 --> 02:10:23.510]  When they say you will eat the bugs, folks, you will eat the cockroach milk.
[02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:25.510]  For babies now, it's cockroach protein.
[02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:27.510]  This is all a sick joke on us.
[02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:34.510]  They're giving you this cow protein, this crystal, this bad cow protein,
[02:10:34.510 --> 02:10:36.510]  so that then you get violently sick.
[02:10:36.510 --> 02:10:38.510]  That's how they're doing it.
[02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:41.510]  Just like glyphosate was because they were spraying it on the wheat,
[02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:44.510]  not just to kill the baby plants growing up with corn or soybean,
[02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:46.510]  but on the wheat to stop fungus.
[02:10:46.510 --> 02:10:50.510]  You're now ingesting wheat sprayed with this, and they go,
[02:10:50.510 --> 02:10:52.510]  oh, suddenly no one can eat wheat.
[02:10:52.510 --> 02:10:53.510]  No, folks, you can eat wheat.
[02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:56.510]  You can't eat Roundup.
[02:10:56.510 --> 02:10:58.510]  Remember the famous Roundup executive wouldn't drink it?
[02:10:58.510 --> 02:10:59.510]  Said, I'll drink it.
[02:10:59.510 --> 02:11:00.510]  It's good for you.
[02:11:00.510 --> 02:11:01.510]  Oh, well, drink it.
[02:11:01.510 --> 02:11:02.510]  Well, I'm not crazy.
[02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:03.510]  Cue that clip up.
[02:11:03.510 --> 02:11:06.510]  Roundup lobbyist refuses to drink Roundup.
[02:11:06.510 --> 02:11:08.510]  Well, we'll play that because we don't just –
[02:11:08.510 --> 02:11:10.510]  we've only played that clip probably 500 times in the last 20 years.
[02:11:10.510 --> 02:11:15.510]  We won't tell you about something unless we show it to you.
[02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:19.510]  We're going to show you the documents, but here's the big takeaway.
[02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:20.510]  We have the studies.
[02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:22.510]  We have it, but humans don't work that way.
[02:11:22.510 --> 02:11:23.510]  We'll show you studies.
[02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:28.510]  We'll show you CDC, FDA, PubMed, British Medical Journal.
[02:11:28.510 --> 02:11:29.510]  We're going to show you all that.
[02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:33.510]  You can look it up for yourself, but you know what you really go off of.
[02:11:33.510 --> 02:11:35.510]  Did you get food poisoning at that restaurant?
[02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:37.510]  Was a movie good?
[02:11:37.510 --> 02:11:40.510]  You go off word of mouth, which is the best intel.
[02:11:40.510 --> 02:11:42.510]  I say it's the worst intel.
[02:11:42.510 --> 02:11:44.510]  It's the best intel.
[02:11:44.510 --> 02:11:47.510]  We're going to show like, hey, did that drug work?
[02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:48.510]  Yeah, it worked great.
[02:11:48.510 --> 02:11:49.510]  Did it not work?
[02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:50.510]  It made me sick.
[02:11:50.510 --> 02:11:53.510]  So we have been flooded and inundated.
[02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:55.510]  So when I get back tomorrow in the studio, I'm driving back,
[02:11:55.510 --> 02:12:01.510]  as soon as we end the show here, with people, including the crew,
[02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:03.510]  who may be on the show tomorrow if they're willing to do it,
[02:12:03.510 --> 02:12:06.510]  in the control room because they're all private, and I get that,
[02:12:06.510 --> 02:12:08.510]  that their own family members and they themselves,
[02:12:08.510 --> 02:12:11.510]  some of them have ever taken the shot, cannot eat beef,
[02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:13.510]  which is their main target first.
[02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:14.510]  So you're like, oh, I'm not going to quit eating beef.
[02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:15.510]  Oh, really?
[02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:16.510]  You're not going to quit eating beef?
[02:12:16.510 --> 02:12:17.510]  We'll show you.
[02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:22.510]  We already got half the people not to eat flour or wheat.
[02:12:22.510 --> 02:12:24.510]  So this is a big deal, folks.
[02:12:24.510 --> 02:12:25.510]  This is a big deal.
[02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:26.510]  This is the next big thing.
[02:12:26.510 --> 02:12:30.510]  So please don't let me, once it gets super bad, go, God, he was right.
[02:12:30.510 --> 02:12:31.510]  They're now admitting this.
[02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:36.510]  Let's stop it now together because we're all watching each other's backs here.
[02:12:36.510 --> 02:12:39.510]  So Rob Dew is here to break this down.
[02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:41.510]  I've got a whole folder dealing with it.
[02:12:42.510 --> 02:12:45.510]  Like, oh, my gosh, everybody's allergic to meat now, to beef.
[02:12:45.510 --> 02:12:46.510]  It's because of the tick.
[02:12:46.510 --> 02:12:47.510]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:50.510]  People in Canada can't eat beef now, and the tick isn't there.
[02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:51.510]  People in Germany can't eat it.
[02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:52.510]  The tick's not there.
[02:12:52.510 --> 02:12:53.510]  People in Australia can't eat it.
[02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:54.510]  The tick's not there.
[02:12:54.510 --> 02:12:55.510]  The tick is the cover.
[02:12:55.510 --> 02:13:01.510]  Like, oh, Rodney James had a heart attack because he got COVID.
[02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:03.510]  No, it's the shot.
[02:13:03.510 --> 02:13:06.510]  So you've got a bunch of text messages, a bunch of tweets, a bunch of emails.
[02:13:06.510 --> 02:13:11.510]  Rob Dew on top of this first breakdown, the details of it, what the syndrome is,
[02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:14.510]  and then get into just the huge response we've gotten.
[02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:17.510]  We're going to open the phones up tomorrow for folks to say, hey,
[02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:19.510]  maybe you took the shot, and it's great.
[02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:21.510]  But I've got a sneaking suspicion.
[02:13:21.510 --> 02:13:22.510]  We're going to open the phones up.
[02:13:22.510 --> 02:13:25.510]  It's going to be nothing but callers that can't eat beef now
[02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:27.510]  because they took the shot.
[02:13:27.510 --> 02:13:30.510]  Well, alpha-gal syndrome, thanks, Alex, is from the Mayo Clinic.
[02:13:30.510 --> 02:13:32.510]  It's a type of food allergy.
[02:13:33.510 --> 02:13:37.510]  And so this alpha-gal is a protein, and they're putting it in.
[02:13:37.510 --> 02:13:38.510]  You can look this up.
[02:13:38.510 --> 02:13:39.510]  This is a Mayo Clinic document.
[02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:41.510]  It talks about alpha-gal.
[02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:45.510]  Then we showed yesterday a CDC document, products that may contain alpha-gal,
[02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:47.510]  which you guys have that one.
[02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:48.510]  You know what?
[02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:50.510]  I'll show it to this little camera over here so people can see it.
[02:13:50.510 --> 02:13:52.510]  They believe it's a CDC document right there.
[02:13:52.510 --> 02:13:53.510]  We can pull it up too.
[02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:54.510]  Right there.
[02:13:54.510 --> 02:13:59.510]  And if you go to the end of this, it has a link to another CDC PDF,
[02:13:59.510 --> 02:14:02.510]  and it tells you non-food products that may contain alpha-gal.
[02:14:02.510 --> 02:14:06.510]  You have gelatin, glycerin, magnesium stearate, and bovine extract.
[02:14:06.510 --> 02:14:09.510]  Bovine extract is basically when they liquefy a baby cow
[02:14:09.510 --> 02:14:11.510]  and use that as the medium for those vaccines.
[02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:13.510]  And by the way, you sent this to the network.
[02:14:13.510 --> 02:14:16.510]  We're going to skip this break, but it's in the video we posted yesterday.
[02:14:16.510 --> 02:14:17.510]  It's in the video, yes.
[02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:18.510]  So we'll put all of it on screen.
[02:14:18.510 --> 02:14:19.510]  Keep going.
[02:14:19.510 --> 02:14:21.510]  All that reference.
[02:14:21.510 --> 02:14:24.510]  And there's a link that takes you to a list of vaccines.
[02:14:24.510 --> 02:14:30.510]  And I just cross-referenced those items in the vaccines
[02:14:30.510 --> 02:14:31.510]  and just did a search.
[02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:34.510]  And you can see there's about 15 different vaccines
[02:14:34.510 --> 02:14:36.510]  that contain these products in one form or another.
[02:14:36.510 --> 02:14:39.510]  And this is what's triggering.
[02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:40.510]  That may cause the allergy.
[02:14:40.510 --> 02:14:41.510]  That will cause the allergy.
[02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:42.510]  And there's studies.
[02:14:42.510 --> 02:14:43.510]  You can just do studies.
[02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:44.510]  Look up alpha-gal.
[02:14:44.510 --> 02:14:45.510]  And here's the interesting thing.
[02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:48.510]  They sometimes use the alpha symbol, which it looks like an A,
[02:14:48.510 --> 02:14:50.510]  but it's got a weird side on it.
[02:14:50.510 --> 02:14:53.510]  But it's A-gal, and it's the same thing.
[02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:55.510]  So some people say alpha-gal, some people say A-gal.
[02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:58.510]  So when you're using your searches, notice that.
[02:14:58.510 --> 02:14:59.510]  Sometimes you won't find.
[02:14:59.510 --> 02:15:03.510]  You have to almost copy the A-gal and put it into a search engine,
[02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:05.510]  and then you'll find even more things about it.
[02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:07.510]  And it's amazing stuff looking at all this.
[02:15:07.510 --> 02:15:10.510]  Basically, this protein is in a lot of vaccines.
[02:15:10.510 --> 02:15:13.510]  And you look at the comments we got on Twitter.
[02:15:13.510 --> 02:15:16.510]  I developed a beef allergy shortly after my four-year-old shots.
[02:15:16.510 --> 02:15:17.510]  I can't eat meat.
[02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:18.510]  Had my first steak two years ago.
[02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:19.510]  Made me sick.
[02:15:19.510 --> 02:15:23.510]  Yeah, so somebody, great patriots, posted the full 15-minute report.
[02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:24.510]  Oh, exactly.
[02:15:24.510 --> 02:15:26.510]  Got thousands of comments, like half of them.
[02:15:26.510 --> 02:15:27.510]  I can't eat meat anymore.
[02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:30.510]  I've been hypersensitive since my last pneumonia vaccine.
[02:15:30.510 --> 02:15:33.510]  So it's in a lot of the vaccines that people are taking,
[02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:37.510]  and then your immune system is getting hit after you take the COVID shot.
[02:15:37.510 --> 02:15:38.510]  So it could be activating it.
[02:15:38.510 --> 02:15:42.510]  I don't believe them when they say it's not in there, because you can search.
[02:15:42.510 --> 02:15:43.510]  It's like, oh, alpha-gal.
[02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:44.510]  There's studies saying it's triggering it.
[02:15:44.510 --> 02:15:49.510]  Well, they also said there was no green monkey cells in the COVID vaccine,
[02:15:49.510 --> 02:15:51.510]  yet the guy who was doing the Human Genome Project,
[02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:54.510]  one of the people who worked on it, found it in the vials,
[02:15:54.510 --> 02:15:55.510]  clean vials of the vaccine.
[02:15:55.510 --> 02:15:59.510]  He discovered it himself, the DNA and RNA fragments of the green monkey.
[02:15:59.510 --> 02:16:00.510]  And Jenny Megibus exposed it.
[02:16:00.510 --> 02:16:01.510]  Exactly.
[02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:02.510]  Dr. Megibus.
[02:16:02.510 --> 02:16:04.510]  So you can't believe anything they say.
[02:16:04.510 --> 02:16:07.510]  And they'll have an army of fact-checkers when you search for things saying,
[02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:08.510]  oh, no, it doesn't exist.
[02:16:08.510 --> 02:16:09.510]  It's fine.
[02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:10.510]  Just keep doing it.
[02:16:10.510 --> 02:16:11.510]  As you see people drop dead around you,
[02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:14.510]  as you read the comments of people having food allergies after taking these
[02:16:14.510 --> 02:16:17.510]  vaccines, and then as you take the COVID shot,
[02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:19.510]  your immune system gets even more suppressed, and boom,
[02:16:19.510 --> 02:16:21.510]  it allows this gene to go forward.
[02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:25.510]  I know several people got the COVID-19 shot that can now not eat beef.
[02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:26.510]  Interesting connection.
[02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:27.510]  Weird.
[02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:28.510]  I know two people who took the jab.
[02:16:28.510 --> 02:16:29.510]  This happened to them.
[02:16:29.510 --> 02:16:30.510]  Every time they eat meat, it makes them sick.
[02:16:30.510 --> 02:16:33.510]  You can go read the comments for yourself in that tweet.
[02:16:33.510 --> 02:16:34.510]  It's amazing.
[02:16:34.510 --> 02:16:37.510]  And I would trust these people more than I trust the CDC at this point,
[02:16:37.510 --> 02:16:39.510]  because they've been caught lying over and over again.
[02:16:40.510 --> 02:16:41.510]  And we know the peanut allergy.
[02:16:41.510 --> 02:16:43.510]  They grew vaccines on peanuts.
[02:16:43.510 --> 02:16:44.510]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:16:44.510 --> 02:16:45.510]  Yeah.
[02:16:45.510 --> 02:16:46.510]  And that's the thing.
[02:16:46.510 --> 02:16:50.510]  They put these things in the vaccine to stimulate a response to your immune
[02:16:50.510 --> 02:16:52.510]  system, but then your immune system goes, oh,
[02:16:52.510 --> 02:16:53.510]  anytime we see that, we're going to attack it.
[02:16:53.510 --> 02:16:56.510]  It's like when the UN got caught adding a female hormone to the second
[02:16:56.510 --> 02:16:58.510]  trimester to tetanus to sterilize a woman.
[02:16:58.510 --> 02:17:02.510]  Yeah, that article is in the report we did there, too.
[02:17:02.510 --> 02:17:04.510]  And that's kind of a blast from the past.
[02:17:04.510 --> 02:17:06.510]  That was from the 90s and early 2000s.
[02:17:06.510 --> 02:17:08.510]  Yeah, let's put yesterday's report we followed up on screen.
[02:17:08.510 --> 02:17:09.510]  What was the exact headline?
[02:17:09.510 --> 02:17:10.510]  I forget.
[02:17:10.510 --> 02:17:15.510]  COVID vaccines contain cow protein that triggers toxic meat allergies.
[02:17:15.510 --> 02:17:17.510]  And we talk about the weaponization of the food supply,
[02:17:17.510 --> 02:17:18.510]  because that's what's going on.
[02:17:18.510 --> 02:17:22.510]  They want you allergic to the basic things that are good for you.
[02:17:22.510 --> 02:17:23.510]  Meat is good for you.
[02:17:23.510 --> 02:17:24.510]  Eggs are good for you.
[02:17:24.510 --> 02:17:26.510]  That's some of the best food you could be eating.
[02:17:26.510 --> 02:17:27.510]  Butter is good for you.
[02:17:27.510 --> 02:17:28.510]  Regular pure butter, not that.
[02:17:28.510 --> 02:17:29.510]  Milds your brain.
[02:17:29.510 --> 02:17:30.510]  Yeah.
[02:17:30.510 --> 02:17:31.510]  As long as you don't burn it.
[02:17:31.510 --> 02:17:36.510]  Your body and your brain run on these fats and oils that are not the seed
[02:17:37.510 --> 02:17:39.510]  oils, the good oils that come from animals.
[02:17:39.510 --> 02:17:41.510]  And so they don't want you eating that anymore.
[02:17:41.510 --> 02:17:43.510]  They want you on this lab-grown stuff.
[02:17:43.510 --> 02:17:45.510]  They'll probably say, oh, the new lab-grown meat doesn't have alpha.
[02:17:45.510 --> 02:17:47.510]  That's why they're rolling out the lab meat.
[02:17:47.510 --> 02:17:48.510]  Yes, which is grown on cancer tumors.
[02:17:48.510 --> 02:17:51.510]  I mean, it's disgusting what they want to do to our bodies.
[02:17:51.510 --> 02:17:52.510]  That's right.
[02:17:52.510 --> 02:17:54.510]  They grow Bill Gates on record on his own website.
[02:17:54.510 --> 02:17:58.510]  They grow the lab-grown meat from immortal cell-line cancer tumors.
[02:17:58.510 --> 02:17:59.510]  Yes.
[02:17:59.510 --> 02:18:00.510]  Because it grows well.
[02:18:00.510 --> 02:18:01.510]  That's the food, yeah.
[02:18:01.510 --> 02:18:02.510]  It grows quickly.
[02:18:02.510 --> 02:18:03.510]  You're eating cancer tumors.
[02:18:03.510 --> 02:18:05.510]  Folks, you can't make this up.
[02:18:05.510 --> 02:18:06.510]  It's totally disgusting.
[02:18:06.510 --> 02:18:08.510]  And so that's why you have to do your own research.
[02:18:08.510 --> 02:18:10.510]  There's a lot of studies out there.
[02:18:10.510 --> 02:18:13.510]  They're talking about different blood types with the alpha-gal.
[02:18:13.510 --> 02:18:16.510]  Some people will show the alpha-gal response after COVID.
[02:18:16.510 --> 02:18:17.510]  Some people won't.
[02:18:17.510 --> 02:18:21.510]  They did a study of employees at, I don't know if it was CDC, but it was
[02:18:21.510 --> 02:18:27.510]  prevalence of alpha-gal in mammalian meat in COVID-19 vaccine employee cohort.
[02:18:27.510 --> 02:18:32.510]  So they were tracking this in some people, and the ones who had COVID-19
[02:18:32.510 --> 02:18:35.510]  showed a higher incidence of this alpha-gal in their system.
[02:18:35.510 --> 02:18:38.510]  So I'm not saying it's in there.
[02:18:38.510 --> 02:18:41.510]  I haven't found these smoking guns saying this alpha-gal is in there.
[02:18:41.510 --> 02:18:43.510]  But I do not trust these guys one bit.
[02:18:43.510 --> 02:18:45.510]  But that's the cover shot that triggers it.
[02:18:45.510 --> 02:18:46.510]  It is in a bunch of the vaccines.
[02:18:46.510 --> 02:18:47.510]  It's in a bunch of the vaccines.
[02:18:47.510 --> 02:18:48.510]  List the vaccines it's in.
[02:18:48.510 --> 02:18:51.510]  I'll pull that out in one second because I'll have to go to that.
[02:18:51.510 --> 02:18:52.510]  It's a small writing here.
[02:18:52.510 --> 02:18:53.510]  But here it is.
[02:18:53.510 --> 02:18:54.510]  Okay.
[02:18:54.510 --> 02:18:57.510]  So, yeah, I'll just list the ones that have these items in there.
[02:18:57.510 --> 02:19:02.510]  So the adenovirus vaccine, the TICE vaccine, the DTAP,
[02:19:02.510 --> 02:19:05.510]  three different types of TDAPs, hepatitis A.
[02:19:05.510 --> 02:19:07.510]  Let's go to the next page.
[02:19:07.510 --> 02:19:13.510]  Influenza, the flu mist, IPV, the Japanese encephalitis, MMR,
[02:19:13.510 --> 02:19:15.510]  the MMR quadvalent.
[02:19:15.510 --> 02:19:18.510]  So they're growing it on beef cells instead of dead babies,
[02:19:18.510 --> 02:19:21.510]  which we think is good, but it's actually causing a beef allergy.
[02:19:21.510 --> 02:19:22.510]  Exactly.
[02:19:22.510 --> 02:19:25.510]  And then it may not be enough in your system,
[02:19:25.510 --> 02:19:27.510]  or you were able to work through it.
[02:19:27.510 --> 02:19:28.510]  But then when you take that COVID shot,
[02:19:28.510 --> 02:19:30.510]  that thing is crushing your immune system.
[02:19:30.510 --> 02:19:31.510]  And that's what it's designed to do.
[02:19:31.510 --> 02:19:33.510]  It's designed to crush your immune system.
[02:19:33.510 --> 02:19:34.510]  And it's a spike protein too.
[02:19:34.510 --> 02:19:35.510]  Exactly.
[02:19:35.510 --> 02:19:36.510]  And all these things are proteins.
[02:19:36.510 --> 02:19:39.510]  I think they're getting down to the science of if we can manipulate proteins,
[02:19:39.510 --> 02:19:43.510]  it's hard to pinpoint how these things work because it's kind of hard.
[02:19:43.510 --> 02:19:44.510]  This is new science.
[02:19:44.510 --> 02:19:47.510]  This is new within the last, you know, 20, 30 years.
[02:19:47.510 --> 02:19:50.510]  But they've been working on mRNA vaccines for about 20 years now,
[02:19:50.510 --> 02:19:54.510]  and they've kind of perfected it in the term of a bioweapon.
[02:19:54.510 --> 02:19:56.510]  And they can never roll them out because they always kill people.
[02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:57.510]  Exactly.
[02:19:57.510 --> 02:20:00.510]  But then once COVID happened, they're like, oh, now we have the test case.
[02:20:00.510 --> 02:20:04.510]  We're going to do a worldwide test and see if we put this much in it.
[02:20:04.510 --> 02:20:06.510]  That's why you saw the different batches of vials.
[02:20:06.510 --> 02:20:08.510]  You had some that were saline, some that were like half strength,
[02:20:08.510 --> 02:20:10.510]  and then some that were full strength that were killing people.
[02:20:10.510 --> 02:20:13.510]  So the bottom line is they told us they're coming out with the food supply.
[02:20:13.510 --> 02:20:15.510]  They told us we won't eat beef, and they're doing it.
[02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:16.510]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:20:16.510 --> 02:20:17.510]  That's it.
[02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:18.510]  They're going to make us unable to eat beef.
[02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:20.510]  That's how they're going to stop us from eating beef.
[02:20:20.510 --> 02:20:22.510]  And here's the good news.
[02:20:22.510 --> 02:20:26.510]  Everybody freaked out about some beef producers said we're going to inject mRNA
[02:20:26.510 --> 02:20:30.510]  in our cows for COVID as if COVID was killing cows and dogs and cats.
[02:20:30.510 --> 02:20:31.510]  There was a backlash.
[02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:34.510]  The Beef Association said, okay, we won't.
[02:20:34.510 --> 02:20:35.510]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:38.510]  They give us a shot that makes us allergic, so we can't eat it anyways.
[02:20:38.510 --> 02:20:39.510]  Exactly.
[02:20:39.510 --> 02:20:40.510]  But they're not targeting the cows, folks.
[02:20:40.510 --> 02:20:41.510]  They're targeting us.
[02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:42.510]  This is the big enchilada.
[02:20:42.510 --> 02:20:46.510]  This is the big story because there's 2 million people, according to UN report,
[02:20:46.510 --> 02:20:48.510]  2.1 million, that make their living off cows.
[02:20:48.510 --> 02:20:51.510]  I can tell you, East Texas, we've got 2,000 acres left.
[02:20:51.510 --> 02:20:55.510]  We've got Mexican land grants, Spanish land grants before Santa Ana.
[02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:58.510]  And we don't really make money on the cows, but it pays the property tax.
[02:20:58.510 --> 02:21:00.510]  It pays for the tractors.
[02:21:00.510 --> 02:21:02.510]  And, you know, people can basically live on that.
[02:21:02.510 --> 02:21:06.510]  You don't make a lot of money, but you take cows away, it's over.
[02:21:06.510 --> 02:21:08.510]  And you're having good stakes.
[02:21:08.510 --> 02:21:10.510]  So that's living great, isn't it?
[02:21:10.510 --> 02:21:14.510]  Well, Genesis starts after God sets up the planet and let there be light
[02:21:14.510 --> 02:21:15.510]  and water and all that.
[02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:19.510]  He says, and now I create cows and the grass, the greatest gift.
[02:21:20.510 --> 02:21:21.510]  I mean, it literally says the cows.
[02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:27.510]  I forget the exact quote, but pull up Genesis quotes about cows and grass.
[02:21:27.510 --> 02:21:29.510]  I mean, it's like over and over again.
[02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:31.510]  I give you cows, I give you grass, I give you cows, I give you grass.
[02:21:31.510 --> 02:21:33.510]  It's like incredible.
[02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:35.510]  You put cows out there, they eat, you get this great meat.
[02:21:35.510 --> 02:21:37.510]  I mean, it's like it's energy.
[02:21:37.510 --> 02:21:39.510]  It's like they're cutting off our pipelines, cutting off our cars,
[02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:40.510]  cutting off our gas.
[02:21:40.510 --> 02:21:42.510]  They're cutting off our food.
[02:21:42.510 --> 02:21:44.510]  Yeah, and that's what they don't want.
[02:21:44.510 --> 02:21:46.510]  They don't want you to have any choice but to go to this lab,
[02:21:46.510 --> 02:21:50.510]  grow meat in a 15-minute city with a microchip in your hand.
[02:21:50.510 --> 02:21:52.510]  Remember 30 years ago they said beef's horrible.
[02:21:52.510 --> 02:21:55.510]  All the studies show now it's a perfect food for people, for adults.
[02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:56.510]  That's what we used to eat.
[02:21:56.510 --> 02:21:57.510]  We used to hunt bison.
[02:21:57.510 --> 02:21:58.510]  We used to hunt mammoth.
[02:21:58.510 --> 02:21:59.510]  We used to eat meat.
[02:21:59.510 --> 02:22:00.510]  That's what we did.
[02:22:00.510 --> 02:22:02.510]  And if we didn't eat it, then we started growing food.
[02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:04.510]  And there's nothing wrong with vegetables,
[02:22:04.510 --> 02:22:07.510]  but meat has got the fats in it that your brain needs.
[02:22:07.510 --> 02:22:11.510]  Well, everybody knows it was always the meat eaters conquered the agrarians.
[02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:12.510]  Yeah.
[02:22:12.510 --> 02:22:15.510]  There's an amazing picture of, I think it's these Mongolian dudes,
[02:22:15.510 --> 02:22:16.510]  and they look giant,
[02:22:16.510 --> 02:22:18.510]  and there's these little Europeans standing in front of them
[02:22:18.510 --> 02:22:20.510]  that probably eat nothing but cheese and bread.
[02:22:20.510 --> 02:22:21.510]  And you can see the difference.
[02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:23.510]  These other guys look like they'd wipe them off the map, no problem.
[02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:25.510]  And that's why Genghis Khan conquered everybody,
[02:22:25.510 --> 02:22:28.510]  because his guys were eating meat and drinking goat milk.
[02:22:28.510 --> 02:22:30.510]  Look, it's a lie, folks.
[02:22:30.510 --> 02:22:32.510]  All these vegans are dying now.
[02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:33.510]  Yeah.
[02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:34.510]  Yeah, it's terrible.
[02:22:34.510 --> 02:22:35.510]  And there is factory farming.
[02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:36.510]  There are excesses.
[02:22:36.510 --> 02:22:37.510]  We're not defending all that.
[02:22:37.510 --> 02:22:39.510]  The point is getting rid of it for factory-grown meat?
[02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:40.510]  It's even worse.
[02:22:40.510 --> 02:22:41.510]  It is.
[02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:43.510]  And that's where it comes from.
[02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:46.510]  You can't trust anything these people say at the bottom line.
[02:22:46.510 --> 02:22:48.510]  They tell you there's nothing in these vaccines.
[02:22:48.510 --> 02:22:49.510]  There's lots of stuff in these.
[02:22:49.510 --> 02:22:52.510]  Well, they're saying a tick is causing people not to be able to eat beef
[02:22:52.510 --> 02:22:54.510]  in places the tick doesn't exist.
[02:22:54.510 --> 02:22:58.510]  And I wouldn't be surprised if the tick had been engineered just like the Lyme disease.
[02:22:58.510 --> 02:22:59.510]  Well, Lyme disease did come.
[02:22:59.510 --> 02:23:02.510]  The Nazis after World War II were brought to Plum Island off New York.
[02:23:02.510 --> 02:23:03.510]  It's declassified.
[02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:06.510]  They created Lyme disease that has tick-delivered syphilis.
[02:23:06.510 --> 02:23:08.510]  So it wouldn't surprise me that they engineer a tick
[02:23:08.510 --> 02:23:10.510]  and put it out in the wild to just go around and eat people
[02:23:10.510 --> 02:23:12.510]  and then go, oh, we can blame it on this tick,
[02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:15.510]  because maybe there is some instances of this tick giving people a meat allergy.
[02:23:15.510 --> 02:23:17.510]  But there's not enough to what's going on now.
[02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:19.510]  Well, it's happening in Japan.
[02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:20.510]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:23:20.510 --> 02:23:22.510]  It's happening in Germany.
[02:23:22.510 --> 02:23:23.510]  The damn tick isn't there.
[02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:24.510]  Yeah.
[02:23:24.510 --> 02:23:26.510]  So we know they've done it.
[02:23:26.510 --> 02:23:29.510]  If we get out ahead of it and get the beef community to say, hey, it's the shots,
[02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:33.510]  because notice now they're backing off glyphosate on wheat,
[02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:37.510]  which is mature, about to be harvested wheat.
[02:23:37.510 --> 02:23:40.510]  You don't spray it to keep weeds going up because that dissipates and runs off,
[02:23:40.510 --> 02:23:42.510]  gets in the water table, and you drink it and get cancer.
[02:23:42.510 --> 02:23:43.510]  It's still bad.
[02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:46.510]  But nothing compared to them in the last 20 years spraying the wheat,
[02:23:46.510 --> 02:23:49.510]  and then you just eat this and go, oh, my God, I can't eat gluten all of a sudden.
[02:23:49.510 --> 02:23:50.510]  Right.
[02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:51.510]  You're not gluten intolerant.
[02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:52.510]  You're Roundup intolerant.
[02:23:52.510 --> 02:23:53.510]  Yeah.
[02:23:53.510 --> 02:23:54.510]  Nobody wants Roundup.
[02:23:54.510 --> 02:23:55.510]  Nobody needs Alpha-Gal.
[02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:57.510]  These things are not good for you.
[02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:59.510]  So that's why they're using them.
[02:23:59.510 --> 02:24:00.510]  What's it called?
[02:24:00.510 --> 02:24:01.510]  Alpha-Gal?
[02:24:01.510 --> 02:24:02.510]  Alpha-Gal.
[02:24:02.510 --> 02:24:03.510]  Explain what Alpha-Gal is.
[02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:07.510]  Alpha-Gal is a protein that when you eat it, you become allergic to meat,
[02:24:07.510 --> 02:24:10.510]  or when it's in your body, you become allergic to meat.
[02:24:10.510 --> 02:24:12.510]  And it's an old bunch of shots.
[02:24:12.510 --> 02:24:13.510]  Not just cow.
[02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:14.510]  Yeah.
[02:24:14.510 --> 02:24:15.510]  And they blame it on the tick.
[02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:16.510]  Right.
[02:24:16.510 --> 02:24:17.510]  Which, give me a break, folks.
[02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:18.510]  It's a fraud.
[02:24:18.510 --> 02:24:19.510]  So it's a big deal.
[02:24:19.510 --> 02:24:21.510]  And once they get beef, it'll be fish.
[02:24:21.510 --> 02:24:22.510]  It'll be everything.
[02:24:22.510 --> 02:24:23.510]  It'll be everything.
[02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:24.510]  And then what will you have?
[02:24:24.510 --> 02:24:27.510]  We'll have, you know, bugs, which also.
[02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:28.510]  Titan's extremely toxic.
[02:24:28.510 --> 02:24:29.510]  Top of that.
[02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:30.510]  Yeah.
[02:24:30.510 --> 02:24:32.510]  So you got bugs, and you're going to have lab-grown tumor meat.
[02:24:32.510 --> 02:24:34.510]  And that's going to be your meat.
[02:24:34.510 --> 02:24:35.510]  From immortal cell lines.
[02:24:35.510 --> 02:24:36.510]  Yeah.
[02:24:36.510 --> 02:24:38.510]  From immortal cell lines, you want to have a nightmare.
[02:24:38.510 --> 02:24:39.510]  Exactly.
[02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:42.510]  Like, throw a tumor in a vat.
[02:24:42.510 --> 02:24:45.510]  It just grows until you have a 500-pound tumor.
[02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:46.510]  Yeah.
[02:24:46.510 --> 02:24:48.510]  And then they cut it up and put it into a fake steak.
[02:24:48.510 --> 02:24:52.510]  In fact, show that video, folks, of them taking the tumor meat, cancer meat,
[02:24:52.510 --> 02:24:54.510]  and literally creating a fake steak for you.
[02:24:54.510 --> 02:24:55.510]  That's how sick Bill Gates is.
[02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:57.510]  And if you accept him, he wins.
[02:24:57.510 --> 02:25:00.510]  In closing, I thought that was a pretty amazing press conference.
[02:25:00.510 --> 02:25:02.510]  JonesCrowder.com, free month.
[02:25:02.510 --> 02:25:03.510]  People sign up right now.
[02:25:03.510 --> 02:25:04.510]  Start this new Friday show.
[02:25:04.510 --> 02:25:06.510]  We're going to launch a bunch of other stuff.
[02:25:06.510 --> 02:25:09.510]  If this is successful, which it should be, reporters, crew,
[02:25:09.510 --> 02:25:11.510]  whole thing out of this.
[02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:12.510]  We'll keep Inforwards going.
[02:25:12.510 --> 02:25:13.510]  Great guys.
[02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:14.510]  We'll merge them together.
[02:25:14.510 --> 02:25:16.510]  But a lot of new blood.
[02:25:16.510 --> 02:25:18.510]  This is called diversifying your portfolio, you know,
[02:25:18.510 --> 02:25:19.510]  because if you are one target,
[02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:21.510]  then you're only one target that the people can take out.
[02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:24.510]  If you've got a lot of targets spread out, it's harder for them to take out.
[02:25:24.510 --> 02:25:26.510]  And I've got some bad news for our enemies.
[02:25:26.510 --> 02:25:28.510]  I mean, I've got all the other groups offering deals,
[02:25:28.510 --> 02:25:30.510]  but Crowder is the one I'm doing.
[02:25:30.510 --> 02:25:32.510]  But, I mean, they mess with me too much,
[02:25:33.510 --> 02:25:36.510]  Well, and Rumble's shown that they're not going to censor people.
[02:25:36.510 --> 02:25:40.510]  I haven't seen anything yet where Rumble's pulling people's videos
[02:25:40.510 --> 02:25:42.510]  and canceling channels unless it's, you know,
[02:25:42.510 --> 02:25:45.510]  something serious where they're doxing people.
[02:25:45.510 --> 02:25:46.510]  Well, it's classic.
[02:25:46.510 --> 02:25:49.510]  It's hacking, calls for murder, drug dealing, pedophilia.
[02:25:49.510 --> 02:25:50.510]  It's all bad.
[02:25:50.510 --> 02:25:51.510]  That's normal law.
[02:25:51.510 --> 02:25:52.510]  That's the web six, seven years ago.
[02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:53.510]  It's back to normal free internet.
[02:25:53.510 --> 02:25:54.510]  Exactly.
[02:25:54.510 --> 02:25:58.510]  So go to JonesCrowder.com to get the free month, the best deal.
[02:25:58.510 --> 02:26:01.510]  You get Steven Crowder shows, all the other shows they've got.
[02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:03.510]  JonesCrowder.com, and that's going to support us.
[02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:04.510]  Take action now.
[02:26:04.510 --> 02:26:05.510]  You want us to fight?
[02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:08.510]  It's up to you to take action.
[02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:10.510]  Rob, we're going to air big excerpts of the press conference
[02:26:10.510 --> 02:26:12.510]  that happened at 9 a.m. this morning.
[02:26:12.510 --> 02:26:13.510]  We only aired part of it earlier.
[02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:14.510]  We're going to air more of it coming up.
[02:26:14.510 --> 02:26:19.510]  And then we have a great guest host that is taking over in the fourth hour.
[02:26:19.510 --> 02:26:20.510]  Maria Z.
[02:26:20.510 --> 02:26:21.510]  Maria Z.
[02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:24.510]  And then we've got Owen Troyer, 3 p.m. Central.
[02:26:24.510 --> 02:26:25.510]  And I'm telling you, this is all going to go great.
[02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:28.510]  People like Owen, other shows we'll be able to produce out of our operation
[02:26:28.510 --> 02:26:29.510]  and be on here.
[02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:32.510]  So that's really what this is all about, teaming up with a great production crew,
[02:26:32.510 --> 02:26:34.510]  great people that aren't scared, the great folks at Rebel.
[02:26:34.510 --> 02:26:36.510]  Because Rebel reached out and wanted to do a deal too,
[02:26:36.510 --> 02:26:38.510]  but they didn't have the production.
[02:26:38.510 --> 02:26:39.510]  So it's perfect with Crowder.
[02:26:39.510 --> 02:26:40.510]  We're very excited.
[02:26:40.510 --> 02:26:41.510]  Yeah, I am too.
[02:26:41.510 --> 02:26:43.510]  And meeting the crew and hanging out with them last night,
[02:26:43.510 --> 02:26:45.510]  because I've come here a lot with you.
[02:26:45.510 --> 02:26:48.510]  But just meeting the crew and see how engaged they are and how smart they are,
[02:26:48.510 --> 02:26:51.510]  it's like a bunch of other info warriors out there doing more stuff
[02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:53.510]  to really just get the word out.
[02:26:53.510 --> 02:26:55.510]  Because at the end of the day, that's the most important thing,
[02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:57.510]  informing people because we can't trust the mainstream media
[02:26:57.510 --> 02:26:59.510]  and we can't trust the government anymore.
[02:26:59.510 --> 02:27:00.510]  Absolutely.
[02:27:00.510 --> 02:27:02.510]  So the big press conference for the next 30 minutes is coming up.
[02:27:02.510 --> 02:27:03.510]  Spread the word.
[02:27:03.510 --> 02:27:04.510]  You're the wave this dog hunts.
[02:27:04.510 --> 02:27:06.510]  But separately, didn't plug the last two and a half hours,
[02:27:06.510 --> 02:27:09.510]  we have great products at infowarriorstore.com that fund us,
[02:27:09.510 --> 02:27:11.510]  that also enrich your life.
[02:27:11.510 --> 02:27:16.510]  You need our 3,000 milligram strongest, most powerful natural CBD for your body,

[02:27:22.510 --> 02:27:24.510]  what they sell it for in stores under another name.
[02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:27.510]  We've got that under Rebel Zen.
[02:27:27.510 --> 02:27:30.510]  We have the Nitric Oxide, Nitric Boost,
[02:27:30.510 --> 02:27:33.510]  so good for your heart and blocking the spikes and cleaning out your blood.
[02:27:33.510 --> 02:27:34.510]  That's discounted.
[02:27:34.510 --> 02:27:36.510]  Superfinal Vitality, almost sold out.
[02:27:36.510 --> 02:27:37.510]  We're sold out of Super Male.
[02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:39.510]  Superfinal is the same thing, just pink label.
[02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:41.510]  60% off, unprecedented.
[02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:43.510]  We have so many other great products.
[02:27:43.510 --> 02:27:45.510]  This is the last day.
[02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:46.510]  I forgot to tell you.
[02:27:46.510 --> 02:27:49.510]  I said Wednesday's the last day, but 10% off on water filtration,
[02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:52.510]  all swearable food, highest rated water filtration and oil filtration,

[02:28:02.510 --> 02:28:03.510]  It's all filled up with garbage.

[02:29:56.510 --> 02:29:58.510]  With all the craziness in the world,
[02:29:58.510 --> 02:29:59.510]  the collapsing borders,
[02:29:59.510 --> 02:30:01.510]  the war with Russia,
[02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:02.510]  the insanity,
[02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:04.510]  the currency devaluations,
[02:30:04.510 --> 02:30:05.510]  the economy going crazy,
[02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:07.510]  you are crazy, in my view,
[02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:09.510]  if you don't get high-quality, storable food
[02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:11.510]  and water filtration and self-defense.
[02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:13.510]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[02:30:13.510 --> 02:30:15.510]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself
[02:30:15.510 --> 02:30:16.510]  and learn how to use if you haven't.
[02:30:16.510 --> 02:30:18.510]  And I preach to the choir on that.
[02:30:18.510 --> 02:30:20.510]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns,
[02:30:20.510 --> 02:30:23.510]  but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:25.510]  This is something you need now.
[02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:27.510]  And we've got it in the food department
[02:30:27.510 --> 02:30:29.510]  and in the high-quality water filtration department.

[02:31:04.510 --> 02:31:06.510]  and all the problems of the economy,
[02:31:06.510 --> 02:31:09.510]  we could not get the highest quality colloidal silver
[02:31:09.510 --> 02:31:12.510]  for almost three years back in stock.
[02:31:12.510 --> 02:31:14.510]  But now we've got it.
[02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:16.510]  30 parts per million from the top lab.
[02:31:16.510 --> 02:31:17.510]  We've got a limited shipment.
[02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:19.510]  Hopefully, we'll have a lot of it in the future.
[02:31:19.510 --> 02:31:21.510]  But if you want to experience
[02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:23.510]  and have in your medicine cabinet,

[02:31:58.510 --> 02:32:00.510]  I want to thank Alex Jones and InfoWars
[02:32:00.510 --> 02:32:03.510]  for offering scholarships to River University.
[02:32:03.510 --> 02:32:06.510]  Maybe you're watching InfoWars today
[02:32:06.510 --> 02:32:08.510]  and you don't know what to do
[02:32:08.510 --> 02:32:10.510]  with the problems that we face in the world today.
[02:32:10.510 --> 02:32:12.510]  You've been through COVID-19,
[02:32:12.510 --> 02:32:15.510]  2019, 20, 21, 22, 23.
[02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:17.510]  But here at River University,
[02:32:17.510 --> 02:32:20.510]  not only do we show you what the problem is,
[02:32:20.510 --> 02:32:22.510]  but we show you how to deal with it.
[02:32:22.510 --> 02:32:25.510]  Come, a full three-year bachelor degree
[02:32:25.510 --> 02:32:29.510]  will train you up in ministry, government, worship,
[02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:32.510]  that you can go out and actually bring about
[02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:34.510]  a transformation in the earth today.
[02:32:34.510 --> 02:32:36.510]  We have graduates going all over the world,
[02:32:36.510 --> 02:32:38.510]  from the Arctic to the Outback,

[02:32:40.510 --> 02:32:42.510]  We specialize in training people
[02:32:42.510 --> 02:32:46.510]  and equipping them for transformation.
[02:32:46.510 --> 02:32:47.510]  And that's what you'll do.
[02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:49.510]  So scan the QR code right now

[02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:55.510]  offered to you by InfoWars.
[02:32:56.600 --> 02:33:06.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:07.430 --> 02:33:14.430]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:37.430 --> 02:33:42.430]  Have you been compromising day in and day out when no compromise is necessary?
[02:33:46.430 --> 02:33:51.430]  And I'll go one further. Where no compromise should ever be expected from you.
[02:33:53.430 --> 02:33:56.430]  It is time to match intensity.
[02:34:00.430 --> 02:34:06.430]  Every single one of you watching or listening right now needs to flip a switch in your head
[02:34:06.430 --> 02:34:13.430]  where you will make those sons of bitches embarrassed that they ever even thought of asking that compromise.
[02:34:16.430 --> 02:34:20.430]  Imagine the founding fathers looking down and going, what the f*** are you people doing?
[02:34:20.430 --> 02:34:26.430]  You're talking about the same people that rail against misinformation, who platform Adam Schiff.
[02:34:26.430 --> 02:34:29.430]  This case needs to be blown up and the ATF needs to be held accountable.
[02:34:29.430 --> 02:34:32.430]  Why can we not condemn evil behavior?
[02:34:37.430 --> 02:34:40.430]  Why can we not condemn evil behavior?
[02:34:41.430 --> 02:34:44.430]  Why can't we just let it go?
[02:34:45.430 --> 02:34:49.430]  Why can't we just let it go?
[02:34:49.430 --> 02:34:52.430]  Why can't we just let it go?
[02:34:55.430 --> 02:34:59.430]  Hello Mug Club and all you strange animals out there.
[02:34:59.430 --> 02:35:08.870]  We've been hard at work with our friends at Rumble to bring you the first network controlled
[02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:09.990]  by creators.
[02:35:09.990 --> 02:35:15.270]  And two of the biggest giants in this industry are joining forces under the same umbrella.
[02:35:15.270 --> 02:35:16.470]  No more censorship.
[02:35:16.470 --> 02:35:18.190]  No more big tech dependents.
[02:35:18.190 --> 02:35:20.190]  No more one-sided contracts.
[02:35:20.190 --> 02:35:24.830]  The time for an open, honest, and transparent network has arrived.
[02:35:24.830 --> 02:35:28.030]  The time for a network controlled by the creators has arrived.
[02:35:28.030 --> 02:35:33.430]  The time for a network that allows creators to focus on their audience has arrived.
[02:35:33.430 --> 02:35:38.750]  If you're signing up for MugClub today, use promo code replatforming for a free Fight
[02:35:38.750 --> 02:35:40.030]  Like Hell t-shirt.
[02:35:40.030 --> 02:35:42.030]  Join us in that fight.
[02:35:42.030 --> 02:35:43.270]  We didn't seek this out, guys.
[02:35:43.270 --> 02:35:47.150]  We didn't look for the extra work of trying to start a network.
[02:35:47.150 --> 02:35:48.950]  We wanted to do a show.
[02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:50.790]  We wanted to make people laugh.
[02:35:50.790 --> 02:35:55.270]  We wanted to educate and entertain them and try to help save our country.
[02:35:55.270 --> 02:35:57.970]  But so many of you weren't being served.
[02:35:57.970 --> 02:36:02.450]  It was all about scam advertising, dishonest tactics, censorship, playing ball with people
[02:36:02.450 --> 02:36:04.330]  that don't share your values.
[02:36:04.330 --> 02:36:07.690]  And we couldn't stand idly by while that happened.
[02:36:07.690 --> 02:36:11.130]  They want to cancel every one of you and every one of us.
[02:36:11.130 --> 02:36:16.370]  But because of you, because of MugClub, they can't touch us.
[02:36:16.370 --> 02:36:17.850]  Let the replatforming begin.
[02:36:17.850 --> 02:36:18.850]  Democrats are afraid of this guy.
[02:36:18.850 --> 02:36:19.850]  The liberal media can't stand him.
[02:36:19.850 --> 02:36:20.850]  And big tech wants to cancel him.
[02:36:20.850 --> 02:36:21.850]  But you have made him uncancellable.
[02:36:21.850 --> 02:36:22.850]  Welcome the strange animal himself, Steven Crowder.

[02:41:10.850 --> 02:41:11.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:11.850 --> 02:41:12.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:12.850 --> 02:41:13.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:13.850 --> 02:41:14.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:14.850 --> 02:41:15.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:15.850 --> 02:41:16.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:16.850 --> 02:41:17.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:17.850 --> 02:41:18.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:18.850 --> 02:41:19.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:19.850 --> 02:41:20.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:20.850 --> 02:41:21.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:21.850 --> 02:41:22.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:22.850 --> 02:41:23.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:23.850 --> 02:41:24.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:24.850 --> 02:41:25.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:25.850 --> 02:41:26.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:26.850 --> 02:41:27.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:27.850 --> 02:41:28.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:28.850 --> 02:41:29.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:29.850 --> 02:41:30.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:30.850 --> 02:41:31.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:31.850 --> 02:41:32.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:32.850 --> 02:41:33.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:33.850 --> 02:41:34.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:34.850 --> 02:41:35.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:35.850 --> 02:41:36.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:36.850 --> 02:41:37.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:37.850 --> 02:41:38.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:38.850 --> 02:41:39.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:39.850 --> 02:41:40.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:40.850 --> 02:41:41.850]  That's what I know.

[02:41:42.850 --> 02:41:43.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:43.850 --> 02:41:44.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:44.850 --> 02:41:45.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:45.850 --> 02:41:46.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:46.850 --> 02:41:47.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:47.850 --> 02:41:48.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:48.850 --> 02:41:49.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:49.850 --> 02:41:50.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:50.850 --> 02:41:51.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:51.850 --> 02:41:52.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:52.850 --> 02:41:53.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:53.850 --> 02:41:54.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:54.850 --> 02:41:55.850]  That's what I know.

[02:41:56.850 --> 02:41:57.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:57.850 --> 02:41:58.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:58.850 --> 02:41:59.850]  That's what I know.
[02:41:59.850 --> 02:42:00.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:00.850 --> 02:42:01.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:01.850 --> 02:42:02.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:02.850 --> 02:42:03.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:03.850 --> 02:42:04.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:04.850 --> 02:42:05.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:05.850 --> 02:42:06.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:06.850 --> 02:42:07.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:07.850 --> 02:42:08.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:08.850 --> 02:42:09.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:09.850 --> 02:42:10.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:10.850 --> 02:42:11.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:11.850 --> 02:42:12.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:12.850 --> 02:42:13.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:13.850 --> 02:42:14.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:14.850 --> 02:42:15.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:15.850 --> 02:42:16.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:16.850 --> 02:42:17.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:17.850 --> 02:42:18.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:18.850 --> 02:42:19.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:19.850 --> 02:42:20.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:20.850 --> 02:42:21.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:21.850 --> 02:42:22.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:22.850 --> 02:42:23.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:23.850 --> 02:42:24.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:24.850 --> 02:42:25.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:25.850 --> 02:42:26.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:26.850 --> 02:42:27.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:27.850 --> 02:42:28.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:28.850 --> 02:42:29.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:29.850 --> 02:42:30.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:30.850 --> 02:42:31.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:31.850 --> 02:42:32.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:32.850 --> 02:42:33.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:33.850 --> 02:42:34.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:34.850 --> 02:42:35.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:35.850 --> 02:42:36.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:36.850 --> 02:42:37.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:37.850 --> 02:42:38.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:38.850 --> 02:42:39.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:39.850 --> 02:42:40.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:40.850 --> 02:42:41.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:41.850 --> 02:42:42.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:42.850 --> 02:42:43.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:43.850 --> 02:42:44.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:44.850 --> 02:42:45.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:45.850 --> 02:42:46.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:46.850 --> 02:42:47.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:47.850 --> 02:42:48.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:48.850 --> 02:42:49.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:49.850 --> 02:42:50.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:50.850 --> 02:42:51.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:51.850 --> 02:42:52.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:52.850 --> 02:42:53.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:53.850 --> 02:42:54.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:54.850 --> 02:42:55.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:55.850 --> 02:42:56.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:56.850 --> 02:42:57.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:57.850 --> 02:42:58.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:58.850 --> 02:42:59.850]  That's what I know.
[02:42:59.850 --> 02:43:00.850]  That's what I know.
[02:43:00.850 --> 02:43:01.850]  That's what I know.
[02:43:01.850 --> 02:43:02.850]  That's what I know.
[02:43:02.850 --> 02:43:03.850]  That's what I know.
[02:43:03.850 --> 02:43:04.850]  That's what I know.
[02:43:04.850 --> 02:43:08.970]  And when I say it's you, it's not just a buzzword.
[02:43:08.970 --> 02:43:16.330]  It's precisely because of you, Mug Club, that these things are now even permissible on these
[02:43:16.330 --> 02:43:27.570]  big tech platforms.
[02:43:27.570 --> 02:43:30.530]  If you heard that voice, there's some foreshadowing.
[02:43:30.530 --> 02:43:32.530]  Son of a bitch.
[02:43:33.210 --> 02:43:35.210]  Mug Club is the tip of the spear.
[02:43:35.210 --> 02:43:42.970]  Mug Club can't, for all of its flaws, and there are many, Mug Club cannot be bought,
[02:43:42.970 --> 02:43:44.690]  sold, or bargained with.
[02:43:44.690 --> 02:43:45.690]  That's the reputation.
[02:43:45.690 --> 02:43:46.690]  Take it or leave it.
[02:43:46.690 --> 02:43:51.930]  And when an entity like that, when an entity comprised of nothing more than all of you,
[02:43:51.930 --> 02:43:56.850]  all of you, you are who we serve, you are to whom we are beholden, and you are the driver
[02:43:56.850 --> 02:44:01.770]  of billions of views and listeners, cumulatively.
[02:44:01.770 --> 02:44:05.890]  The people who want to silence you, who want to dictate what you hear, who hate everything
[02:44:05.890 --> 02:44:07.970]  you stand for, well, guess what?
[02:44:07.970 --> 02:44:10.450]  They can't de-platform us all.
[02:44:10.450 --> 02:44:13.250]  They'd have no one left to do business with.
[02:44:13.250 --> 02:44:17.170]  So now, as a full-fledged network, and the announcements we're about to make, and continue
[02:44:17.170 --> 02:44:20.210]  to make, Mug Club is bigger than them.
[02:44:20.210 --> 02:44:22.130]  Mug Club is why we don't need them.
[02:44:22.130 --> 02:44:25.090]  And that's why all of us here are genuinely free.
[02:44:25.090 --> 02:44:29.770]  You, Mug Club, are the reason that they are scared.
[02:44:29.770 --> 02:44:30.770]  And they should be.
[02:44:30.770 --> 02:44:33.010]  Because wait till you see what's next.
[02:44:33.010 --> 02:44:34.850]  This was just phase one.
[02:44:34.850 --> 02:44:40.170]  Hey, everyone, this is Steven Crowder.
[02:44:40.170 --> 02:44:42.690]  What we're talking about is free speech.
[02:44:42.690 --> 02:44:49.210]  Steven Crowder, it's very offensive.
[02:44:49.210 --> 02:44:50.210]  Very offensive.
[02:44:50.210 --> 02:44:51.490]  Yeah, thanks for having me, Steven.
[02:44:55.890 --> 02:45:00.370]  A piece of living garbage-ass dumpster fire.
[02:45:00.370 --> 02:45:01.370]  Dumpster fire!
[02:45:01.370 --> 02:45:05.370]  I can guarantee you, multiple people right here have been raped.
[02:45:05.370 --> 02:45:06.370]  What?
[02:45:06.370 --> 02:45:07.370]  How can you guarantee that?
[02:45:07.370 --> 02:45:11.370]  People call me the Tony Robbins of assassination.
[02:45:13.370 --> 02:45:14.370]  You know I'm proud of Mug Club.
[02:45:14.370 --> 02:45:16.370]  I'm proud of our forces, Mug Club.
[02:45:16.370 --> 02:45:18.370]  Daily, you know I won't get my money's worth.
[02:45:20.370 --> 02:45:22.370]  Hey, s**t!
[02:45:22.370 --> 02:45:23.370]  What the f**k?
[02:45:23.650 --> 02:45:26.650]  And I'm going to drown every last damn demon baby that I come across.
[02:45:26.650 --> 02:45:30.650]  Whether it's a run off, walk off, demon baby off, I'll go off with the demon baby.
[02:45:32.650 --> 02:45:35.650]  Brian Kelly!
[02:45:38.650 --> 02:45:40.650]  My girl wanted me to run an errand.
[02:45:40.650 --> 02:45:43.650]  And she goes, take my bike.
[02:45:43.650 --> 02:45:46.650]  But it has a basket on the front of it.
[02:45:46.650 --> 02:45:49.650]  I was like, I'm going to walk, you know?
[02:45:49.650 --> 02:45:52.650]  I just feel like I'm a target for homophobic bandits, you know?
[02:45:53.650 --> 02:45:55.650]  For Nick DiPaolo!
[02:45:56.650 --> 02:45:57.650]  Holy s**t!
[02:45:57.650 --> 02:45:59.650]  You know, most serial killers are white, but you know why?
[02:45:59.650 --> 02:46:01.650]  To be a serial killer takes a lot of effort.
[02:46:01.650 --> 02:46:03.650]  It's like a full-time job.
[02:46:03.650 --> 02:46:05.650]  Black crime is just quick and f**king simple.
[02:46:05.650 --> 02:46:07.650]  You know that show, The First 48?
[02:46:07.650 --> 02:46:09.650]  They have a new one, The First 48 Seconds.
[02:46:09.650 --> 02:46:11.650]  It's just black crimes.
[02:46:17.650 --> 02:46:19.650]  I've never heard the N-word so much in my life.
[02:46:19.650 --> 02:46:21.650]  And I had a racist grandmother.
[02:46:21.930 --> 02:46:25.930]  And if you try to take our guns, 1776 will commence again!
[02:46:37.930 --> 02:46:43.930]  We should fight with unwavering confidence for our freedom!
[02:46:46.930 --> 02:46:49.930]  Of comedy specials, we have new shows,
[02:46:50.210 --> 02:46:52.210]  the investigative unit, which we've discussed.
[02:46:52.210 --> 02:46:54.210]  And again, you get a free shirt at loudmouthcrowder.com.
[02:46:54.210 --> 02:46:56.210]  But we have another announcement to make
[02:46:56.210 --> 02:46:59.210]  regarding a new acquisition here.
[02:46:59.210 --> 02:47:01.210]  And by the way, I'll be taking your chats here after this.
[02:47:01.210 --> 02:47:03.210]  We'll be taking some questions from the press.
[02:47:03.210 --> 02:47:06.210]  So you can send your chats in right now on Mug Club.
[02:47:06.210 --> 02:47:08.210]  And we'll be releasing more information
[02:47:08.210 --> 02:47:10.210]  regarding some of the developments.
[02:47:10.210 --> 02:47:13.210]  But this is one that we're all pretty excited about.
[02:47:13.210 --> 02:47:16.210]  And again, if it was just business,
[02:47:16.210 --> 02:47:18.210]  it wouldn't make sense.
[02:47:20.210 --> 02:47:24.210]  This is a man who was removed from the platforms
[02:47:24.210 --> 02:47:28.210]  of Apple, Spotify, Google, Facebook, Meta, X,
[02:47:28.210 --> 02:47:30.210]  whatever the hell it is,
[02:47:30.210 --> 02:47:32.210]  all on the same day.
[02:47:32.210 --> 02:47:34.210]  But there's no coordination.
[02:47:34.210 --> 02:47:36.210]  It's just coincidence.
[02:47:36.210 --> 02:47:38.210]  And there were, by the way, many people back then
[02:47:38.210 --> 02:47:40.210]  who said, well, that's just him.
[02:47:40.210 --> 02:47:42.210]  He's too extreme.
[02:47:42.210 --> 02:47:44.210]  That's just an isolated case.
[02:47:44.210 --> 02:47:46.210]  It won't happen to me.
[02:47:46.210 --> 02:47:48.210]  Well, are you paying attention now?
[02:47:48.490 --> 02:47:50.490]  And so people who we all expect
[02:47:50.490 --> 02:47:52.490]  to stand in the line of fire
[02:47:52.490 --> 02:47:54.490]  who are supposed to be brothers in arms
[02:47:54.490 --> 02:47:56.490]  tucked tail and ran.
[02:47:56.490 --> 02:47:58.490]  They struck plea bargains with the platforms
[02:47:58.490 --> 02:48:00.490]  who, for a period of time,
[02:48:00.490 --> 02:48:02.490]  would punish anyone who even hosted him
[02:48:02.490 --> 02:48:04.490]  as a guest.
[02:48:04.490 --> 02:48:06.490]  This is the canary in the coal mine.
[02:48:06.490 --> 02:48:08.490]  These people at these big tech platforms,
[02:48:08.490 --> 02:48:10.490]  they tell you that they'll never come for you.
[02:48:10.490 --> 02:48:12.490]  That you can keep your tens of millions
[02:48:12.490 --> 02:48:14.490]  in revenue or millions that you make
[02:48:14.490 --> 02:48:16.490]  from their platforms.
[02:48:16.770 --> 02:48:18.770]  What that means is that if you're lucky,
[02:48:18.770 --> 02:48:20.770]  really lucky, they'll kill you last.
[02:48:20.770 --> 02:48:22.770]  Well, they tried to kill
[02:48:22.770 --> 02:48:24.770]  this next man first.
[02:48:24.770 --> 02:48:26.770]  And if he's honest,
[02:48:26.770 --> 02:48:28.770]  he'll tell you they almost did.
[02:48:28.770 --> 02:48:30.770]  They did a lot of damage.
[02:48:30.770 --> 02:48:32.770]  But if there's one thing you can say
[02:48:32.770 --> 02:48:34.770]  about this man, love him or hate him,
[02:48:34.770 --> 02:48:36.770]  is that he will fight for this country
[02:48:36.770 --> 02:48:38.770]  with every last breath in his body
[02:48:38.770 --> 02:48:40.770]  and he just won't die.
[02:48:40.770 --> 02:48:42.770]  So it's with as much pride
[02:48:42.770 --> 02:48:44.770]  that I can convey
[02:48:44.770 --> 02:48:46.770]  I'm as surprised, by the way, as you
[02:48:46.770 --> 02:48:48.770]  in landing this white whale,
[02:48:48.770 --> 02:48:50.770]  the number one draft pick, without a doubt,
[02:48:50.770 --> 02:48:52.770]  out there, that for the first time
[02:48:52.770 --> 02:48:54.770]  he will launch his subscription network
[02:48:54.770 --> 02:48:56.770]  exclusively under the Mug Club umbrella
[02:48:56.770 --> 02:48:58.770]  starting with his new Friday show
[02:48:58.770 --> 02:49:00.770]  on August 18th.
[02:49:00.770 --> 02:49:02.770]  Ladies and gentlemen...
[02:49:08.770 --> 02:49:10.770]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water
[02:49:10.770 --> 02:49:12.770]  that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[02:49:14.770 --> 02:49:16.770]  Stalin took the guns.
[02:49:16.770 --> 02:49:18.770]  Helm took the guns.
[02:49:18.770 --> 02:49:20.770]  El Paso took the guns. Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[02:49:22.770 --> 02:49:24.770]  And if you try to take our guns,
[02:49:24.770 --> 02:49:26.770]  1776 will commence again!
[02:49:28.770 --> 02:49:30.770]  Sticking with Facebook,
[02:49:30.770 --> 02:49:32.770]  it is one of several companies today
[02:49:32.770 --> 02:49:34.770]  that are limiting the content of
[02:49:34.770 --> 02:49:36.770]  Far Right podcast, InfoWars.
[02:49:36.770 --> 02:49:38.770]  Facebook, Apple and YouTube have all taken down
[02:49:38.770 --> 02:49:40.770]  content from Jones and his InfoWars channel.
[02:49:40.770 --> 02:49:42.770]  Whenever I talk about Alex Jones,
[02:49:42.770 --> 02:49:44.770]  my wife will not let me into the house
[02:49:44.770 --> 02:49:46.770]  until I've been deloused.
[02:49:46.770 --> 02:49:48.770]  Anyone who believes in Alex Jones,
[02:49:48.770 --> 02:49:50.770]  and believes these theories,
[02:49:50.770 --> 02:49:52.770]  you really gotta go get help.
[02:49:52.770 --> 02:49:54.770]  Alex Jones has been ordered to pay
[02:49:54.770 --> 02:49:56.770]  965 million dollars.
[02:49:58.770 --> 02:50:00.770]  Look how there's a move
[02:50:00.770 --> 02:50:02.770]  to control information. It's always been.
[02:50:02.770 --> 02:50:04.770]  And it ought to scare people,
[02:50:04.770 --> 02:50:06.770]  but you've got a move to indoctrinate
[02:50:06.770 --> 02:50:08.770]  the children of America.
[02:50:08.770 --> 02:50:10.770]  If they can get you to be part of a group,
[02:50:10.770 --> 02:50:12.770]  Black, Latino and Indigenous people
[02:50:12.770 --> 02:50:14.770]  are suffering and dying.
[02:50:14.770 --> 02:50:16.770]  The most dangerous terrorist threat
[02:50:16.770 --> 02:50:18.770]  to our homeland is white supremacy.
[02:50:18.770 --> 02:50:20.770]  They'll have their little tailor-made people
[02:50:20.770 --> 02:50:22.770]  that are bought and paid for to claim to be your leader.
[02:50:22.770 --> 02:50:24.770]  We're looking at a giant war
[02:50:24.770 --> 02:50:26.770]  in February right now.
[02:50:26.770 --> 02:50:28.770]  Currently, that's the projection.
[02:50:32.770 --> 02:50:34.770]  There's an entire agenda afoot
[02:50:34.770 --> 02:50:36.770]  to force the population
[02:50:36.770 --> 02:50:38.770]  to undergo different types
[02:50:38.770 --> 02:50:40.770]  of medical treatments,
[02:50:40.770 --> 02:50:42.770]  namely vaccines.
[02:50:42.770 --> 02:50:44.770]  In 2002, there is a tyrannical
[02:50:44.770 --> 02:50:46.770]  organization calling itself
[02:50:46.770 --> 02:50:48.770]  the New World Order,
[02:50:48.770 --> 02:50:50.770]  pushing for world-wide
[02:50:50.770 --> 02:50:52.770]  government,
[02:50:52.770 --> 02:50:54.770]  a cashless society.
[02:50:54.770 --> 02:50:56.770]  If any terrorism comes, it's from this government.
[02:50:56.770 --> 02:50:58.770]  And if there was an outside threat like Bin Laden,
[02:50:58.770 --> 02:51:00.770]  who was a known CIS in the 80s,
[02:51:00.770 --> 02:51:02.770]  running the Mujahideen war,
[02:51:02.770 --> 02:51:04.770]  and his family builds all the military bases
[02:51:04.770 --> 02:51:06.770]  over in Saudi Arabia right now,
[02:51:06.770 --> 02:51:08.770]  he's on the board of Iridium Satellite.
[02:51:08.770 --> 02:51:10.770]  He's the boogeyman they need.
[02:51:10.770 --> 02:51:12.770]  I've been shadowbanned.
[02:51:12.770 --> 02:51:14.770]  I've been called a liar.
[02:51:14.770 --> 02:51:16.770]  I've been silenced on virtually every platform
[02:51:16.770 --> 02:51:18.770]  created by man.
[02:51:18.770 --> 02:51:20.770]  My life has been threatened, repeatedly.
[02:51:20.770 --> 02:51:22.770]  They've tried to destroy me,
[02:51:22.770 --> 02:51:24.770]  but I've survived.
[02:51:24.770 --> 02:51:26.770]  And that's why
[02:51:26.770 --> 02:51:28.770]  I'm joining Mug Club.
[02:51:32.770 --> 02:51:34.770]  Alex Jones, everybody!
[02:51:36.770 --> 02:51:38.770]  Woo!
[02:51:38.770 --> 02:51:40.770]  Woo!
[02:51:40.770 --> 02:51:42.770]  Woo!
[02:51:42.770 --> 02:51:44.770]  Woo!
[02:51:44.770 --> 02:51:46.770]  Woo!
[02:51:46.770 --> 02:51:48.770]  Thank you.
[02:51:48.770 --> 02:51:50.770]  Listen, I want to thank everybody tuning in.
[02:51:50.770 --> 02:51:52.770]  I want to thank everybody tuning in right now,
[02:51:52.770 --> 02:51:54.770]  but I'm going to be deadly serious here.
[02:51:54.770 --> 02:51:56.770]  I've not been this excited ever!
[02:51:56.770 --> 02:51:58.770]  Yeah, Mug Club, baby!
[02:51:58.770 --> 02:52:00.770]  Wow!
[02:52:00.770 --> 02:52:02.770]  So, I've known Stephen for more than 10 years.
[02:52:02.770 --> 02:52:04.770]  I used to, you know, beg him to come on my show.
[02:52:04.770 --> 02:52:06.770]  He's a really busy guy,
[02:52:06.770 --> 02:52:08.770]  and he's been a bit of a popper forever.
[02:52:08.770 --> 02:52:10.770]  But we kind of knew each other,
[02:52:10.770 --> 02:52:12.770]  but as soon as I got deplatformed,
[02:52:12.770 --> 02:52:14.770]  he saw it as a threat, and he said,
[02:52:14.770 --> 02:52:16.770]  I want you on immediately.
[02:52:16.770 --> 02:52:18.770]  The day after, when everybody else was running away,
[02:52:18.770 --> 02:52:20.770]  including my friends, he was like,
[02:52:20.770 --> 02:52:22.770]  no, this is a danger to everybody.
[02:52:22.770 --> 02:52:24.770]  I see what this is.
[02:52:24.770 --> 02:52:26.770]  And then again, everybody else was shutting down
[02:52:26.770 --> 02:52:28.770]  during the lockdown.
[02:52:28.770 --> 02:52:30.770]  I didn't. He didn't.
[02:52:30.770 --> 02:52:32.770]  And so it's that type of instinctive courage
[02:52:32.770 --> 02:52:34.770]  and let's be clear, Infowars isn't going anywhere,
[02:52:34.770 --> 02:52:36.770]  or Austin Operation, my regular show
[02:52:36.770 --> 02:52:38.770]  that's on talk radio everywhere,
[02:52:38.770 --> 02:52:40.770]  but we've been talking for years
[02:52:40.770 --> 02:52:42.770]  about some type of collaboration,
[02:52:42.770 --> 02:52:44.770]  and he had to move from where he was
[02:52:44.770 --> 02:52:46.770]  to trailblaze and do this,
[02:52:46.770 --> 02:52:48.770]  and what's incredible is, it's succeeding.
[02:52:48.770 --> 02:52:50.770]  But here's the key.
[02:52:50.770 --> 02:52:52.770]  We don't just have the left and the globalists
[02:52:52.770 --> 02:52:54.770]  and big tech and the intelligence agencies.
[02:52:54.770 --> 02:52:56.770]  We now know that we're censoring
[02:52:56.770 --> 02:52:58.770]  and controlling and suppressing election information
[02:52:58.770 --> 02:53:00.770]  and vaccine information and open border
[02:53:00.770 --> 02:53:02.770]  and human trafficking information,
[02:53:02.770 --> 02:53:04.770]  fentanyl info and Afghan withdrawal info.
[02:53:04.770 --> 02:53:06.770]  It's the big think tanks
[02:53:06.770 --> 02:53:08.770]  that Crowder alluded to earlier
[02:53:08.770 --> 02:53:10.770]  that are so-called conservative
[02:53:10.770 --> 02:53:12.770]  that have billions of dollars
[02:53:12.770 --> 02:53:14.770]  over the last decade to buy and control
[02:53:14.770 --> 02:53:16.770]  the populist, nationalist,
[02:53:16.770 --> 02:53:18.770]  common sense capitalist movement
[02:53:18.770 --> 02:53:20.770]  that this country was founded on
[02:53:20.770 --> 02:53:22.770]  that made it the apple of the world's eye.
[02:53:22.770 --> 02:53:24.770]  And so we're not just challenging the left
[02:53:24.770 --> 02:53:26.770]  and Hollywood and big tech.
[02:53:26.770 --> 02:53:28.770]  We're challenging Conservative Inc.
[02:53:28.770 --> 02:53:30.770]  It didn't make sense to some people
[02:53:30.770 --> 02:53:32.770]  that weren't clued in or on the inside
[02:53:32.770 --> 02:53:34.770]  of what really goes on six months ago
[02:53:34.770 --> 02:53:36.770]  when Crowder was making a big deal
[02:53:36.770 --> 02:53:38.770]  about the other big Conservative platforms
[02:53:38.770 --> 02:53:40.770]  that aren't Conservative.
[02:53:40.770 --> 02:53:42.770]  They interface with YouTube and Facebook
[02:53:42.770 --> 02:53:44.770]  before Twitter was sold to Musk
[02:53:44.770 --> 02:53:46.770]  and literally sit around in smoky rooms
[02:53:46.770 --> 02:53:48.770]  laughing at the Conservatives.
[02:53:48.770 --> 02:53:50.770]  And I've been around it.
[02:53:50.770 --> 02:53:52.770]  It's disgusting to people that have authenticity
[02:53:52.770 --> 02:53:54.770]  like Stephen Crowder and this incredible crew.
[02:53:54.770 --> 02:53:56.770]  These are real people.
[02:53:56.770 --> 02:53:58.770]  These are real people right here.
[02:53:58.770 --> 02:54:00.770]  Gerald Morgan, all of these comedians.
[02:54:00.770 --> 02:54:02.770]  All these people have turned down
[02:54:02.770 --> 02:54:04.770]  tens of millions of dollars
[02:54:04.770 --> 02:54:06.770]  to tell the truth.
[02:54:06.770 --> 02:54:08.770]  There's people out there like Ted Nugent
[02:54:08.770 --> 02:54:10.770]  lost probably $100 million the last
[02:54:10.770 --> 02:54:12.770]  six, seven years supporting Trump.
[02:54:12.770 --> 02:54:14.770]  It's been in the news. Just no more stadiums,
[02:54:14.770 --> 02:54:16.770]  no more nothing.
[02:54:16.770 --> 02:54:18.770]  So there's not many people like that.
[02:54:18.770 --> 02:54:20.770]  Probably should bring Ted Nugent over here.
[02:54:20.770 --> 02:54:22.770]  But what I'm getting down to is
[02:54:22.770 --> 02:54:24.770]  we need an independent network
[02:54:24.770 --> 02:54:26.770]  that's controlled. And I'm sorry,
[02:54:26.770 --> 02:54:28.770]  Twitter is better than some of the other
[02:54:28.770 --> 02:54:30.770]  so-called Conservative or open platforms
[02:54:30.770 --> 02:54:32.770]  but it's still not even halfway free.
[02:54:32.770 --> 02:54:34.770]  Yeah, halfway free feels better than no free.
[02:54:34.770 --> 02:54:36.770]  And I'm not even criticizing Twitter.
[02:54:36.770 --> 02:54:38.770]  It's just not free.
[02:54:38.770 --> 02:54:40.770]  So many really effective people that expose
[02:54:40.770 --> 02:54:42.770]  Communist China and certain owners
[02:54:42.770 --> 02:54:44.770]  of Twitter's connection to it,
[02:54:44.770 --> 02:54:46.770]  they're all still censored. But not Mug Club.
[02:54:46.770 --> 02:54:48.770]  And I know the plan that Crowder has,
[02:54:48.770 --> 02:54:50.770]  he's told me about it, he's told you a lot about it,
[02:54:50.770 --> 02:54:52.770]  is to literally bring on hundreds of providers
[02:54:52.770 --> 02:54:54.770]  and I guess in the long term even thousands
[02:54:54.770 --> 02:54:56.770]  and then use the great folks at Rumble
[02:54:56.770 --> 02:54:58.770]  that really are free and open
[02:54:58.770 --> 02:55:00.770]  to energize this. So people always
[02:55:00.770 --> 02:55:02.770]  say, hey, if you want your own internet,
[02:55:02.770 --> 02:55:04.770]  why don't you build it? Or you want your own platform,
[02:55:04.770 --> 02:55:06.770]  build it. Well, it's very hard to do,
[02:55:06.770 --> 02:55:08.770]  but he's been able to do it because of you,
[02:55:08.770 --> 02:55:10.770]  the Mug Club members. And that gives him that
[02:55:10.770 --> 02:55:12.770]  independence. So you literally aren't just
[02:55:12.770 --> 02:55:14.770]  the tail of the dog, you're the whole shoot mat.
[02:55:14.770 --> 02:55:16.770]  You're the whole dog, the teeth, the brain,
[02:55:16.770 --> 02:55:18.770]  the feet, the guts, the heart,
[02:55:18.770 --> 02:55:20.770]  the brain, the eyes and ears
[02:55:20.770 --> 02:55:22.770]  with the investigative unit and everything.
[02:55:22.770 --> 02:55:24.770]  You are this operation and if you
[02:55:24.770 --> 02:55:26.770]  get excited about this, it's game over for the New World Order.
[02:55:26.770 --> 02:55:28.770]  Listen, we came and founded a new country
[02:55:28.770 --> 02:55:30.770]  to get away from tyranny. We weren't
[02:55:30.770 --> 02:55:32.770]  perfect, but became the freest, greatest thing
[02:55:32.770 --> 02:55:34.770]  ever. So it's that the Israelites
[02:55:34.770 --> 02:55:36.770]  left Egypt
[02:55:36.770 --> 02:55:38.770]  under Ramesses II
[02:55:38.770 --> 02:55:40.770]  and they've now dug up all the tablets
[02:55:40.770 --> 02:55:42.770]  and the history and that's a true story, it really happened.
[02:55:42.770 --> 02:55:44.770]  It's on the Egyptian hieroglyphs as well.
[02:55:44.770 --> 02:55:46.770]  So Stephen Crowder and
[02:55:46.770 --> 02:55:48.770]  the Mug Club and this whole operation is literally
[02:55:48.770 --> 02:55:50.770]  leading everybody out of Egypt and we don't
[02:55:50.770 --> 02:55:52.770]  have to wait 50 years or 40
[02:55:52.770 --> 02:55:54.770]  years to cross the River Jordan, folks.
[02:55:54.770 --> 02:55:56.770]  We're doing it right now. It's already launched
[02:55:56.770 --> 02:55:58.770]  out of the gate successful. That is a
[02:55:58.770 --> 02:56:00.770]  true American success story
[02:56:00.770 --> 02:56:02.770]  of dedication, work, not
[02:56:02.770 --> 02:56:04.770]  backing down and it challenges
[02:56:04.770 --> 02:56:06.770]  the entire system. So when
[02:56:06.770 --> 02:56:08.770]  this is successful, and it already is, but I mean
[02:56:08.770 --> 02:56:10.770]  super successful, it will then be the
[02:56:10.770 --> 02:56:12.770]  example to all the other big, so
[02:56:12.770 --> 02:56:14.770]  called conservative, populist talk show
[02:56:14.770 --> 02:56:16.770]  hosts who don't like serving the globalists
[02:56:16.770 --> 02:56:18.770]  but are too scared to buck them
[02:56:18.770 --> 02:56:20.770]  to let them then have
[02:56:20.770 --> 02:56:22.770]  the courage to follow us. So this
[02:56:22.770 --> 02:56:24.770]  is true leadership
[02:56:24.770 --> 02:56:26.770]  and history that you're watching
[02:56:26.770 --> 02:56:28.770]  right now today. Now here's another
[02:56:28.770 --> 02:56:30.770]  key point. If you look at the
[02:56:30.770 --> 02:56:32.770]  40 plus billion that Anheuser-Busch
[02:56:32.770 --> 02:56:34.770]  has lost with the entire debacle
[02:56:34.770 --> 02:56:36.770]  with Bud Light,
[02:56:36.770 --> 02:56:38.770]  that's a great example of us saying
[02:56:38.770 --> 02:56:40.770]  we're going to withdraw support of people targeting
[02:56:40.770 --> 02:56:42.770]  children and sexualization and this
[02:56:42.770 --> 02:56:44.770]  whole transhumanist movement. That's what it is.
[02:56:44.770 --> 02:56:46.770]  I mean, you all know Harari at the
[02:56:46.770 --> 02:56:48.770]  WF says, oh, this is just the beginning. If you'll accept two
[02:56:48.770 --> 02:56:50.770]  men having a baby, you'll accept cyborgs, all the
[02:56:50.770 --> 02:56:52.770]  rest of it, clones, animal-human hybrids,
[02:56:52.770 --> 02:56:54.770]  which is all out in the open now.
[02:56:54.770 --> 02:56:56.770]  But instead of just boycotts, what about
[02:56:56.770 --> 02:56:58.770]  boycotts? And that's what this
[02:56:58.770 --> 02:57:00.770]  is, folks. You get all these great shows,
[02:57:00.770 --> 02:57:02.770]  all these great memberships, all these
[02:57:02.770 --> 02:57:04.770]  great things and know that you're part of history
[02:57:04.770 --> 02:57:06.770]  bucking the system, American
[02:57:06.770 --> 02:57:08.770]  Revolution, 1776,
[02:57:08.770 --> 02:57:10.770]  Worldwide 2.0. So the boycotts
[02:57:10.770 --> 02:57:12.770]  are great. Pull your money out of the
[02:57:12.770 --> 02:57:14.770]  globalist system, but then spend it
[02:57:14.770 --> 02:57:16.770]  with the institutions and organizations that
[02:57:16.770 --> 02:57:18.770]  are standing for freedom. If Anheuser-Busch
[02:57:18.770 --> 02:57:20.770]  just lost, I think the number I saw last week was
[02:57:20.770 --> 02:57:22.770]  41 billion, it just keeps going up and up,
[02:57:22.770 --> 02:57:24.770]  25% market share in all of
[02:57:24.770 --> 02:57:26.770]  their products. Think
[02:57:26.770 --> 02:57:28.770]  about what would happen if people spent a
[02:57:28.770 --> 02:57:30.770]  billion on Mug Club instead of 10 million
[02:57:30.770 --> 02:57:32.770]  or whatever, because this guy's putting almost
[02:57:32.770 --> 02:57:34.770]  everything back into the operation
[02:57:34.770 --> 02:57:36.770]  because it is about
[02:57:36.770 --> 02:57:38.770]  the excitement of standing up for liberty
[02:57:38.770 --> 02:57:40.770]  and connecting to our forefathers
[02:57:40.770 --> 02:57:42.770]  and foremothers that created this country.
[02:57:42.770 --> 02:57:44.770]  And that's what this is about.
[02:57:46.770 --> 02:57:48.770]  I beg you to think about
[02:57:48.770 --> 02:57:50.770]  how important your
[02:57:50.770 --> 02:57:52.770]  word of mouth is and you

[02:59:34.770 --> 02:59:36.770]  InfoWarsStore.com
[02:59:36.770 --> 02:59:38.770]  Silver Bullet returns
[02:59:38.770 --> 02:59:40.770]  to InfoWarsStore.com
[02:59:40.770 --> 02:59:42.770]  and while you're there, get some super female
[02:59:42.770 --> 02:59:44.770]  vitality, some turbo force,
[02:59:44.770 --> 02:59:46.770]  some brain force and some brain force ultra.
[02:59:47.100 --> 03:00:10.220]  So Stephen Crowder and the Mug Club and this whole operation is literally leading everybody
[03:00:10.220 --> 03:00:14.780]  out of Egypt and we don't have to wait 50 years or 40 years to cross the River Jordan
[03:00:14.780 --> 03:00:15.780]  folks.
[03:00:15.780 --> 03:00:16.780]  We're doing it right now.
[03:00:16.780 --> 03:00:18.900]  It's already launched out of the gate successful.
[03:00:18.900 --> 03:00:25.940]  That is a true American success story of dedication, work, not backing down and it challenges the
[03:00:25.940 --> 03:00:26.940]  entire system.
[03:00:26.940 --> 03:00:30.860]  So when this is successful and it already is, but I mean super accessible, it will then
[03:00:30.860 --> 03:00:35.740]  be the example to all the other big so-called conservative populist talk show hosts who
[03:00:35.740 --> 03:00:40.980]  don't like serving the globalists, but are too scared to buck them to let them then
[03:00:40.980 --> 03:00:43.060]  have the courage to follow us.
[03:00:43.060 --> 03:00:48.420]  So this is true leadership and history that you're watching right now today.
[03:00:48.420 --> 03:00:50.240]  Now, now here's another key point.
[03:00:50.240 --> 03:00:57.740]  If you look at the 40 plus billion that Anheuser-Busch has lost with the entire debacle with Bud Light,
[03:00:57.740 --> 03:01:01.180]  that's a great example of us saying we're going to withdraw support of people targeting
[03:01:01.180 --> 03:01:04.500]  children and sexualization and this whole transhumanist movement.
[03:01:04.500 --> 03:01:05.500]  That's what it is.
[03:01:05.500 --> 03:01:08.500]  I mean, even you've all know Harari at the WF says, oh, this is just the beginning.
[03:01:08.500 --> 03:01:12.060]  If you'll accept two men having a baby, you'll accept cyborgs, all the rest of it.
[03:01:12.060 --> 03:01:15.180]  You'll accept drones, animal, human hybrids, which is all out in the open now.
[03:01:15.180 --> 03:01:18.540]  But instead of just boycotts, what about boycotts?
[03:01:18.540 --> 03:01:20.220]  And that's what this is, folks.
[03:01:20.220 --> 03:01:24.220]  You get all these great shows, all these great memberships, all these great things, and know
[03:01:24.220 --> 03:01:29.940]  that you're part of history, bucking the system, American Revolution, 1776 worldwide
[03:01:29.940 --> 03:01:30.940]  2.0.
[03:01:30.940 --> 03:01:32.420]  So the boycotts are great.
[03:01:32.420 --> 03:01:36.380]  Pull your money out of the globalist system, but then spend it with the institutions and
[03:01:36.380 --> 03:01:38.580]  organizations that are standing at freedom.
[03:01:38.580 --> 03:01:42.100]  If Anheuser-Busch just lost, I think the number I saw last week was 41 billion, just
[03:01:42.100 --> 03:01:47.100]  keeps going up and up, 25% market share in all of their products.
[03:01:47.100 --> 03:01:51.100]  Think about what would happen if people spent a billion on Mug Club instead of 10 million
[03:01:51.100 --> 03:01:56.180]  or whatever, because this guy's putting almost everything back into the operation because
[03:01:56.180 --> 03:02:01.600]  it is about the excitement of standing up for liberty and connecting to our forefathers
[03:02:01.600 --> 03:02:04.100]  and foremothers that created this country.
[03:02:04.100 --> 03:02:05.100]  And that's what this is about.
[03:02:05.620 --> 03:02:10.500]  It doesn't make business sense to not roll over and make the hundreds of millions and
[03:02:10.500 --> 03:02:11.500]  solve the system.
[03:02:11.500 --> 03:02:14.060]  But wait, if the whole country in the world's gone, that money doesn't matter.
[03:02:14.060 --> 03:02:18.860]  It makes perfect business sense, because our business is prosperity and freedom and justice
[03:02:18.860 --> 03:02:22.460]  and Americana, 1776 worldwide.
[03:02:22.460 --> 03:02:26.580]  So that's what this is.
[03:02:26.580 --> 03:02:27.580]  That's what this is all about.
[03:02:27.580 --> 03:02:30.500]  So so we've been talking for six months about doing this.
[03:02:30.500 --> 03:02:33.500]  And I said, well, I'm going to keep them forwards going, the great group we do.
[03:02:33.500 --> 03:02:35.340]  And they thought and I said, what's your idea?
[03:02:35.340 --> 03:02:36.460]  And I had my idea already written down.
[03:02:36.460 --> 03:02:41.460]  They said, once a week show, build off that, then start building some other shows.
[03:02:41.460 --> 03:02:44.460]  And with the funding we get from this, we'll be able to hire back more reporters, do more
[03:02:44.460 --> 03:02:49.140]  investigative stuff on the ground at the border and at Bilderberg and at Davos and the RNC
[03:02:49.140 --> 03:02:50.140]  and DNC.
[03:02:50.140 --> 03:02:51.860]  So this is a match made in heaven.
[03:02:51.860 --> 03:02:55.500]  Everybody needs to tell your friends, your family, your neighbors, hey, you want a second
[03:02:55.500 --> 03:02:56.540]  American revolution?
[03:02:56.540 --> 03:02:57.540]  You don't like what's happening?
[03:02:57.540 --> 03:03:01.100]  Well, this is the group, this is the organization that is the best there is.
[03:03:01.100 --> 03:03:03.020]  We're not up here saying, you know, we're Superman.
[03:03:03.020 --> 03:03:04.620]  We're up here saying we have all the answers.
[03:03:04.620 --> 03:03:05.620]  But you know what?
[03:03:05.620 --> 03:03:07.180]  It's not bragging when it's fact.
[03:03:07.180 --> 03:03:10.940]  People need to recognize that this operation, what Steven Crowder and his crew are doing
[03:03:10.940 --> 03:03:17.780]  is the best open, freest, biggest thing there is in the world in opposition to the new world
[03:03:17.780 --> 03:03:18.780]  order.
[03:03:18.780 --> 03:03:23.740]  And how you tune into my show, you're going to get you're going to get hardcore analysis
[03:03:23.740 --> 03:03:27.260]  and over the horizon information on what the globalists are planning next.
[03:03:27.260 --> 03:03:28.380]  That's all I do is study it.
[03:03:28.380 --> 03:03:29.380]  It's hardcore.
[03:03:29.380 --> 03:03:30.380]  Don't slit your wrist after you watch it.
[03:03:30.740 --> 03:03:34.740]  But the good thing is you can then tune in to the incredible, amazing, you know, better
[03:03:34.740 --> 03:03:39.860]  than the nighttime comedy shows, live delivery of these guys.
[03:03:39.860 --> 03:03:40.860]  And they make it fun.
[03:03:40.860 --> 03:03:44.420]  And that's why I like the energy here is quite frankly, InfoWars, great crew, great people.
[03:03:44.420 --> 03:03:46.500]  But it's like you are in a bunker.
[03:03:46.500 --> 03:03:48.900]  We've been doing it 20 something years and it's crazy.
[03:03:48.900 --> 03:03:52.620]  So so it's a breath of fresh air to just add this family to what's happening, to be part
[03:03:52.620 --> 03:03:55.380]  of this organization and add the InfoWars crew.
[03:03:55.380 --> 03:03:56.940]  Now you're becoming part of this organization.
[03:03:56.940 --> 03:03:58.580]  I'm just blessed and honored.
[03:03:58.580 --> 03:03:59.580]  It's incredible.
[03:03:59.780 --> 03:04:00.780]  All right.
[03:04:00.780 --> 03:04:01.780]  At 11 a.m.
[03:04:01.780 --> 03:04:04.700]  Just coming up in about an hour from now, I'll do my live show out of the classic Steven
[03:04:04.700 --> 03:04:05.700]  Crowder studios.
[03:04:05.700 --> 03:04:08.060]  We're going to have these guys in here with us.
[03:04:08.060 --> 03:04:09.060]  It's so exciting.
[03:04:09.060 --> 03:04:12.620]  So 11 a.m. Central InfoWars dot com forward slash show and band video.
[03:04:12.620 --> 03:04:16.980]  But I want everybody watching that means on InfoWars everywhere to be part of this revolutionary
[03:04:16.980 --> 03:04:17.980]  act.
[03:04:17.980 --> 03:04:18.980]  You want resistance.
[03:04:18.980 --> 03:04:19.980]  You want somebody to stand up.
[03:04:19.980 --> 03:04:20.980]  You want somebody to fight.
[03:04:20.980 --> 03:04:23.260]  Go now to the Mug Club.
[03:04:23.260 --> 03:04:29.320]  Go now, ladies and gentlemen, to use the promo codes that are there to get a month off.
[03:04:29.320 --> 03:04:30.320]  Do it now.
[03:04:30.320 --> 03:04:31.320]  Go to Mug Club.
[03:04:31.320 --> 03:04:33.880]  Take action because the globalists want war.
[03:04:33.880 --> 03:04:34.880]  They will destroy us.
[03:04:34.880 --> 03:04:35.880]  Well, guess what?
[03:04:35.880 --> 03:04:36.880]  We didn't start this fight.
[03:04:36.880 --> 03:04:37.880]  We don't want it.
[03:04:37.880 --> 03:04:41.880]  But if you want to fight, you better believe you've got one.
[03:04:57.880 --> 03:04:58.880]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[03:04:59.440 --> 03:05:00.440]  Yeah.
[03:05:00.440 --> 03:05:01.440]  Yeah.
[03:05:01.440 --> 03:05:02.440]  So my name is Ken Hacken-Ladley.
[03:05:02.440 --> 03:05:04.760]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[03:05:04.760 --> 03:05:08.480]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkiewicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers
[03:05:08.480 --> 03:05:11.080]  and now two books with Alex Jones.
[03:05:11.080 --> 03:05:14.420]  That's because I use BrainForce every day.
[03:05:14.420 --> 03:05:18.360]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[03:05:18.360 --> 03:05:22.360]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[03:05:22.360 --> 03:05:27.740]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is BrainForce.
[03:05:27.740 --> 03:05:32.700]  I'll take BrainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for
[03:05:32.700 --> 03:05:35.580]  the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[03:05:35.580 --> 03:05:41.300]  So it really is true that BrainForce is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[03:05:41.300 --> 03:05:42.300]  All right.
[03:05:42.300 --> 03:05:43.300]  We love you.
[03:05:43.300 --> 03:05:44.300]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:44.300 --> 03:05:47.300]  Get your BrainForce Plus, BrainForce Ultra and TurboForce at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:05:47.300 --> 03:05:49.300]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[03:05:58.300 --> 03:06:08.300]  Well, that is groundbreaking news right there from Alex.
[03:06:08.300 --> 03:06:14.380]  A big congratulations to Alex, Mug Club, the whole team, Steve and Crowder, Infowars.
[03:06:14.380 --> 03:06:17.420]  What a powerhouse duo right now.
[03:06:17.420 --> 03:06:21.180]  I just am so supportive of independent media.
[03:06:21.180 --> 03:06:23.700]  Independent media is so, so crucial.
[03:06:23.700 --> 03:06:27.900]  You're going to understand why it's so crucial today, or at least it's going to cement it
[03:06:27.900 --> 03:06:29.140]  in for you.
[03:06:29.140 --> 03:06:34.340]  But I'm just asking everyone who's tuning in today to support this project and continue
[03:06:34.340 --> 03:06:37.060]  supporting the truth to get out there.
[03:06:37.060 --> 03:06:42.740]  Anyone who is willing to stare into the face of these globalists and tell you what is really
[03:06:42.740 --> 03:06:48.160]  going on right now, I'm telling you, this is a huge moment in history.
[03:06:48.160 --> 03:06:49.620]  These people are brave.
[03:06:50.140 --> 03:06:52.900]  These people are the warriors of the modern age.
[03:06:52.900 --> 03:06:57.120]  And it is a brave act to tell the truth today, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:06:57.120 --> 03:06:58.540]  Why is it such a brave act?
[03:06:58.540 --> 03:07:02.780]  Because the truth is considered hate speech today.
[03:07:02.780 --> 03:07:03.980]  Everything's inverted.
[03:07:03.980 --> 03:07:05.900]  What is good is being called evil.
[03:07:05.900 --> 03:07:07.940]  What is evil is being called good.
[03:07:07.940 --> 03:07:10.620]  And this is the age that we are living in.
[03:07:10.620 --> 03:07:17.180]  So right now, the most powerful way to dispel the lies, and this is true throughout all of
[03:07:17.180 --> 03:07:23.340]  history, is to tell the truth and break through the deception that is gripping mankind right
[03:07:23.340 --> 03:07:28.860]  now through language, through media, through the propaganda that you see, through algorithms
[03:07:28.860 --> 03:07:34.420]  that are targeted at controlling your brain, changing your behavior, and turning you into
[03:07:34.420 --> 03:07:37.580]  something that you don't recognize.
[03:07:37.580 --> 03:07:41.460]  The antidote to that is the truth.
[03:07:41.460 --> 03:07:45.700]  If you didn't have the truth, you would not know yourself.
[03:07:45.700 --> 03:07:47.380]  Think about that statement right now.
[03:07:47.380 --> 03:07:53.580]  If you did not have the truth, you would not know yourself because you would be a victim
[03:07:53.580 --> 03:07:55.540]  of the propaganda that's out there.
[03:07:55.540 --> 03:07:59.020]  It's not just the mainstream media.
[03:07:59.020 --> 03:08:04.260]  It's algorithms that are targeted at keeping you docile, algorithms that are targeted at
[03:08:04.260 --> 03:08:10.700]  keeping you distracted and entertained while the world is literally on fire.
[03:08:10.700 --> 03:08:13.300]  And the world is literally on fire, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:08:13.300 --> 03:08:20.020]  The Great Reset is in full swing, clawing at the very last straws that it has for its
[03:08:20.020 --> 03:08:25.260]  survival because of the number of people waking up to this, because the truth has broken through
[03:08:25.260 --> 03:08:26.460]  the algorithm.
[03:08:26.460 --> 03:08:29.300]  It's broken through the mind control program.
[03:08:29.300 --> 03:08:34.420]  Millions of people around the world are realizing something is wrong and they're looking for
[03:08:34.420 --> 03:08:38.540]  answers and it's broadcast like this one.
[03:08:38.540 --> 03:08:43.460]  It's broadcast like this very broadcast that you're listening to right now that are going
[03:08:43.460 --> 03:08:45.860]  to literally save lives.
[03:08:45.860 --> 03:08:49.020]  I am not exaggerating.
[03:08:49.020 --> 03:08:50.340]  I am not exaggerating.
[03:08:50.340 --> 03:08:57.500]  This is going to save the lives of adults, of children, of this current generation and
[03:08:57.500 --> 03:08:58.780]  generations to come.
[03:08:58.780 --> 03:09:04.380]  The words that you hear on this broadcast will last beyond the lies because lies eventually
[03:09:04.460 --> 03:09:11.340]  become decimated or they become uncovered, but the truth is something that remains.
[03:09:11.340 --> 03:09:18.700]  So please continue to support Alex and the team here in whatever ventures they move forward
[03:09:18.700 --> 03:09:19.700]  with.
[03:09:19.700 --> 03:09:25.140]  InfoWars is so, so important to the future of humanity.
[03:09:25.140 --> 03:09:27.900]  And I say that as a contributor.
[03:09:27.900 --> 03:09:38.220]  I say that as someone who's depended on InfoWars for many years as the forefront of the battle.
[03:09:38.220 --> 03:09:42.620]  It's about time the rest of humanity realizes it.
[03:09:42.620 --> 03:09:48.500]  I want to talk to you today about the satanic pedophiles of the United Nations.
[03:09:48.500 --> 03:09:50.580]  And that is what they are.
[03:09:50.580 --> 03:09:56.220]  The people at the top of this food chain, or at least those in the public eye, and I've
[03:09:56.220 --> 03:10:00.940]  spoken about this before, the fact that these people, if you know them, they're not at the
[03:10:00.940 --> 03:10:01.940]  top of the food chain.
[03:10:01.940 --> 03:10:03.620]  They're not the ones calling the shots.
[03:10:03.620 --> 03:10:09.720]  But let's talk about the three front organizations that we have right now being the United Nations,
[03:10:09.720 --> 03:10:15.220]  the World Economic Forum, and the World Health Organization that seek to enslave you into
[03:10:15.220 --> 03:10:18.620]  their satanic New Babylon system.
[03:10:18.620 --> 03:10:20.220]  That is what it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:10:20.220 --> 03:10:22.940]  And I want to make this clear.
[03:10:22.940 --> 03:10:25.060]  You may not believe in God.
[03:10:25.060 --> 03:10:26.740]  You may not believe in Satan.
[03:10:26.740 --> 03:10:35.700]  You may not believe that the practices that these people participate in hold any power,
[03:10:35.700 --> 03:10:38.300]  but they do.
[03:10:38.300 --> 03:10:45.540]  And what kind of an uninformed, naive individual, if they, say, work within the military, would
[03:10:45.540 --> 03:10:48.740]  go to war with an enemy that they don't understand?
[03:10:48.800 --> 03:10:57.880]  If you are serving in the military, you don't go into a war with an enemy blind, you study
[03:10:57.880 --> 03:10:58.880]  that enemy.
[03:10:58.880 --> 03:11:00.480]  You understand the way they think.
[03:11:00.480 --> 03:11:01.880]  You understand their culture.
[03:11:01.880 --> 03:11:03.560]  You understand their battle plans.
[03:11:03.560 --> 03:11:08.199]  You understand the way that they conduct themselves in war.
[03:11:08.199 --> 03:11:10.039]  You know what weapons they have.
[03:11:10.039 --> 03:11:12.759]  You know what strategies they deploy.
[03:11:12.759 --> 03:11:19.199]  You go and you assess those strategies in detail before you go and attack that enemy
[03:11:19.199 --> 03:11:21.400]  or before you defend yourself.
[03:11:21.400 --> 03:11:25.759]  Even if you want to defend yourself against that enemy, you must understand them inside
[03:11:25.759 --> 03:11:26.759]  out.
[03:11:26.759 --> 03:11:34.119]  Your enemy, humanity, everyone listening today, your enemy worships Satan.
[03:11:34.119 --> 03:11:38.480]  Your enemy conducts child sacrifice.
[03:11:38.480 --> 03:11:41.779]  Your enemy feeds on the blood of children.
[03:11:41.779 --> 03:11:43.580]  This is their belief system.
[03:11:43.700 --> 03:11:51.980]  No matter what you think about that practice, they do it.
[03:11:51.980 --> 03:11:53.260]  They do it.
[03:11:53.260 --> 03:12:02.500]  They have ancient occult human sacrifice practices that they engage in regularly.
[03:12:02.500 --> 03:12:07.140]  So the sooner humanity accepts that the people at the top of the food chain are engaging
[03:12:07.140 --> 03:12:13.180]  in these ancient occult practices, the easier it will be for them to understand that the
[03:12:13.180 --> 03:12:18.860]  people that they're up against aren't just wanting control only.
[03:12:18.860 --> 03:12:20.820]  This goes far beyond just control.
[03:12:20.820 --> 03:12:21.820]  They have money.
[03:12:21.820 --> 03:12:23.340]  They don't need more money.
[03:12:23.340 --> 03:12:25.020]  They have all the money they want.
[03:12:25.020 --> 03:12:26.820]  They just keep printing it.
[03:12:26.820 --> 03:12:31.060]  And if the fiat system fails, they go and create a new system of fake money.
[03:12:32.100 --> 03:12:36.100]  It's not just about following the money trail.
[03:12:37.100 --> 03:12:42.100]  This is about the soul of every single human on Earth.
[03:12:42.100 --> 03:12:44.100]  This is their ultimate goal.
[03:12:44.100 --> 03:12:47.100]  They want your soul.
[03:12:47.100 --> 03:12:50.100]  They want to destroy you.
[03:12:50.100 --> 03:12:56.100]  And this latest report that I'm going to cover today from these psychopaths
[03:12:56.400 --> 03:13:05.580]  called Report of the Independent Expert on Protection Against Violence and Discrimination
[03:13:05.580 --> 03:13:09.160]  Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity.
[03:13:09.160 --> 03:13:16.920]  This is who they call an independent expert that's written this report, okay.
[03:13:16.920 --> 03:13:20.279]  Now let me tell you about this independent expert.
[03:13:20.279 --> 03:13:23.080]  His name is Victor Madrigal-Balos.
[03:13:23.080 --> 03:13:28.400]  He attended the World Economic Forum Sustainable Development Impact Summit in 2020 and spoke
[03:13:28.400 --> 03:13:35.199]  on including LGBTI populations in response to the COVID-19 crisis.
[03:13:35.199 --> 03:13:36.199]  Crisis.
[03:13:36.199 --> 03:13:42.220]  When asked what actions can be taken to ensure that the responses leave no one behind and
[03:13:42.220 --> 03:13:49.039]  contribute to achieving the 2030 agenda, Victor Madrigal-Balos responded.
[03:13:49.039 --> 03:13:55.320]  It says, Independent Expert on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, United Nations opened
[03:13:55.320 --> 03:14:01.080]  the session by saying, we had reasonable assumptions that during this type of situation there is
[03:14:01.080 --> 03:14:07.220]  usually an escalation of risk and discrimination and also hate speech and incitement to violence
[03:14:07.220 --> 03:14:08.220]  and discrimination.
[03:14:08.220 --> 03:14:11.740]  And in fact, this proved to be the case.
[03:14:11.740 --> 03:14:21.859]  Now he is there offering his expert opinion, as an independent expert, on LGBTQI people.
[03:14:21.859 --> 03:14:28.020]  What statistics do we have to suggest from this independent expert that the violence
[03:14:28.020 --> 03:14:36.100]  towards LGBTQI people, plus people, and the plus is for minor attracted persons, which
[03:14:36.340 --> 03:14:43.539]  is the nice way of saying pedophile that wants to do unspeakable things with your children.
[03:14:43.539 --> 03:14:50.140]  What violence increased against these people by the general population during the time
[03:14:50.140 --> 03:14:51.140]  of COVID?
[03:14:51.140 --> 03:14:52.539]  It didn't.
[03:14:52.539 --> 03:14:56.260]  There is no evidence that this expert has provided.
[03:14:56.260 --> 03:15:01.779]  And yet this is the basis of his fight for human rights to stop the violence.
[03:15:01.779 --> 03:15:05.820]  What does the United Nations mean when they say violence?
[03:15:05.900 --> 03:15:13.400]  What I'm going to talk you through today is this report and I'm going to decode their
[03:15:13.400 --> 03:15:18.560]  language for you to help you understand exactly where this is going and I'm going to tell
[03:15:18.560 --> 03:15:20.279]  you the end goal from now.
[03:15:20.279 --> 03:15:29.320]  The end goal from now is to criminalize you saying anything against pedophiles.
[03:15:29.320 --> 03:15:34.520]  Because these people want to have sex with children, they want it to be legal, I have
[03:15:34.520 --> 03:15:44.600]  proof, it's in their own documents, they want to legalize sex with our children.
[03:15:44.600 --> 03:15:51.720]  When Biden tells you these are our kids, it's because he's grooming you to accept these
[03:15:51.720 --> 03:15:54.080]  people having sex with your children.
[03:15:54.080 --> 03:16:02.400]  We'll be right back, don't go anywhere.
[03:16:02.400 --> 03:16:03.880]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:16:03.880 --> 03:16:06.520]  I want to say turbo force is amazing, it is.
[03:16:06.520 --> 03:16:11.359]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:16:11.359 --> 03:16:14.560]  The fish oil is better than it and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:16:14.560 --> 03:16:20.240]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[03:16:20.240 --> 03:16:24.240]  Krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and I'm sorry, you want something
[03:16:24.240 --> 03:16:25.760]  like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[03:16:25.760 --> 03:16:28.840]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good in my view.
[03:16:28.840 --> 03:16:32.440]  I'm not making a medical statement here but let me tell you something, I eat five capulets
[03:16:32.440 --> 03:16:37.320]  of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:16:37.320 --> 03:16:44.840]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:16:44.840 --> 03:16:48.279]  So we don't make a big profit off of it but you notice I just obsess because whatever
[03:16:48.279 --> 03:16:57.080]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you, I just can't do it.
[03:16:57.080 --> 03:17:01.760]  Tell us about the products, how we support you, how we support all of ourselves and the
[03:17:01.760 --> 03:17:03.760]  big event coming up.
[03:17:03.760 --> 03:17:09.359]  Well yeah, the first one, obviously you can go to MyPillow.com, use that promo code Alex
[03:17:09.359 --> 03:17:14.039]  and you can get all these great discounts on all of our products and just by visiting
[03:17:14.039 --> 03:17:18.640]  this site, you're going to get a $20 free gift emailed to you immediately.
[03:17:18.640 --> 03:17:23.039]  And there's the biggest special we have right now, the 20-year anniversary MyPillow for
[03:17:23.039 --> 03:17:27.520]  1998 for the queen size, normally $69.98.
[03:17:27.520 --> 03:17:32.560]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love doing best, producing and
[03:17:32.560 --> 03:17:34.320]  making the MyPillow.
[03:17:34.320 --> 03:17:41.440]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how using the money for Americana
[03:17:41.440 --> 03:17:43.960]  freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[03:17:43.960 --> 03:17:47.279]  That's what the debanking is about, that's what the financial attacks are about, that's
[03:17:47.279 --> 03:17:52.160]  why we've got a rush to support MyPillow.com and InfoWars.com plus their great products
[03:17:52.160 --> 03:17:57.359]  at both places because we are the tip of the spear.
[03:17:57.359 --> 03:18:02.240]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[03:18:02.240 --> 03:18:06.720]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all
[03:18:06.720 --> 03:18:11.760]  the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[03:18:11.760 --> 03:18:16.960]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula, the new platinum

[03:19:58.500 --> 03:20:04.619]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:06.100 --> 03:20:18.740]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host Maria Zee from zmedia.com coming
[03:20:18.740 --> 03:20:21.460]  to you live from the land down under.
[03:20:21.460 --> 03:20:25.640]  Now I referenced this report before, we're going to go through it, I'm going to try not
[03:20:25.640 --> 03:20:30.220]  to read this word for word for everyone but just sort of cover the main points of the
[03:20:30.220 --> 03:20:35.020]  report and I'm just going to tell you the goal of the report from now before we get to the
[03:20:35.020 --> 03:20:36.340]  actual conclusions in it.
[03:20:36.340 --> 03:20:43.980]  This report is calling for LGBTQI+, which the plus stands for, which represents minor
[03:20:43.980 --> 03:20:49.560]  attracted persons, which means pedophiles, for their rights to be above religious rights.
[03:20:49.560 --> 03:20:53.420]  They're calling for this to happen worldwide, they're calling for the silencing of religious
[03:20:53.420 --> 03:20:59.460]  leaders and they're calling hate speech violence, and we're going to have a look at what they
[03:20:59.460 --> 03:21:04.980]  declare, what they define, I should say, hate speech as in a moment but if you want to look
[03:21:04.980 --> 03:21:11.140]  for this report you can search A forward slash HRC forward slash 53 forward slash 37.
[03:21:11.140 --> 03:21:18.820]  Of course a lot of these reports are difficult to find, they are often hidden within many
[03:21:18.820 --> 03:21:25.400]  other reports and in some sort of meetings that they're being privately funded and probably
[03:21:25.400 --> 03:21:32.040]  funded by the people to do which no one wants, no one invited these people to rule the world
[03:21:32.040 --> 03:21:36.440]  and yet here it is, they're making decisions for us and trying to dictate to us how we
[03:21:36.440 --> 03:21:44.680]  practice our religion and live our lives so I'll talk about what we need to do with this
[03:21:44.680 --> 03:21:50.440]  idiotic organisation at the end of this broadcast but I will go through some of this report
[03:21:50.440 --> 03:21:51.440]  right now.
[03:21:51.440 --> 03:21:55.240]  So again, they're talking about freedom of religion or belief, freedom from violence and
[03:21:55.240 --> 03:21:59.160]  discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
[03:21:59.160 --> 03:22:07.400]  Victor references FORB a lot in the article which is the UN General's Assembly's Special
[03:22:07.400 --> 03:22:14.320]  Rapporteur's Compilation of Articles on Freedom of Religion or Belief and Sexuality 2017 which
[03:22:14.320 --> 03:22:19.360]  is essentially a compilation of reports and discussions concerning freedom of religion
[03:22:19.360 --> 03:22:24.840]  so when I'm talking about FORB that's what I'm referencing so I don't say that whole
[03:22:24.840 --> 03:22:28.240]  thing again throughout this presentation.
[03:22:28.240 --> 03:22:34.400]  Alright so within the introduction they say that the report focuses on spaces where freedom
[03:22:34.400 --> 03:22:40.840]  of thought, conscience and religion or belief and protection from violence and discrimination
[03:22:40.840 --> 03:22:44.840]  based on sexual orientation and gender identity intersect.
[03:22:44.840 --> 03:22:51.120]  So they're trying to talk about well all of these things are fusing in society which
[03:22:51.120 --> 03:22:57.680]  we can't deny and let me just say from the outset I'm not against homosexuals.
[03:22:57.680 --> 03:23:06.020]  I love all people but do I reserve the right to maintain my religious beliefs and not do
[03:23:06.020 --> 03:23:11.400]  anything that violates my personal convictions the same way that someone who has a different
[03:23:11.400 --> 03:23:13.240]  belief system to me does?
[03:23:13.240 --> 03:23:14.240]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:23:14.240 --> 03:23:20.200]  And so if I say baking the cake violates my religious beliefs I'm well within my rights
[03:23:20.200 --> 03:23:26.520]  to do so and if you were for tolerance and inclusivity you would say right okay those are your beliefs
[03:23:26.520 --> 03:23:29.120]  I will go somewhere where someone shares my beliefs.
[03:23:29.120 --> 03:23:36.240]  I wouldn't go to a Hindu to force them to understand Christianity.
[03:23:36.240 --> 03:23:37.240]  You just don't do that.
[03:23:37.240 --> 03:23:42.400]  You just say okay that Hindu has their beliefs, I'm a Christian I'll go over here.
[03:23:42.400 --> 03:23:46.560]  But you know you gotta bake the cake, screw your religion.
[03:23:47.560 --> 03:23:53.800]  Damn that stupid cake. Anyway, back to the report. This is what it's saying. So it's saying,
[03:23:53.800 --> 03:23:59.000]  okay, these things are all fusing in society, which is true, we have this increase of it,
[03:23:59.000 --> 03:24:03.960]  and we should look at how we're going to navigate this. I agree with that. Let's look at how we're
[03:24:03.960 --> 03:24:11.000]  going to navigate this. So they say that the document and the report seeks to explore fundamental
[03:24:11.000 --> 03:24:18.120]  conceptions about our human bonds with the sacred and the mundane, and goes on to sort of talk about
[03:24:19.480 --> 03:24:29.560]  people's sexual experiences, their pleasures, and all of these other things that make up the
[03:24:29.560 --> 03:24:36.520]  human experience. He boasts about meeting with multiple religious leaders, including
[03:24:37.480 --> 03:24:45.800]  the Patriarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church, Mufti of all Muslims, Chair of Jewish Council
[03:24:46.440 --> 03:24:51.800]  in Mozambique, the Mufti of Nampula, I won't read them all out, but he's the Catholic Archbishop,
[03:24:52.440 --> 03:24:57.640]  Chief Rabbis, and all sorts of other religious leaders. He's made the effort to go and do that
[03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:03.320]  so that he can best understand and work together with everyone, because he really wants to work
[03:25:03.320 --> 03:25:06.520]  together with everyone. We'll find out what working together means soon.
[03:25:07.560 --> 03:25:13.240]  Then he says that religion does not have essential or inbuilt positions, and it would make no sense to
[03:25:13.240 --> 03:25:20.120]  position it as inherently or predominantly pro or anti-LGBT. This can be interpreted in one of two
[03:25:20.120 --> 03:25:28.920]  ways. This can be interpreted as religion does not have the right to position itself as this.
[03:25:29.480 --> 03:25:34.440]  It shouldn't be positioning itself as this. Screw what that religion believes,
[03:25:34.440 --> 03:25:40.840]  and what its values are, and what its traditions are. I think that that's really the undertone of
[03:25:40.840 --> 03:25:44.680]  this entire report, which will make sense when we look at the conclusions.
[03:25:46.840 --> 03:25:51.480]  Within the legal framework that they outlined, they say that all persons should live free from
[03:25:51.480 --> 03:25:55.640]  violence and discrimination based on their sexual orientation and or gender identity,
[03:25:56.600 --> 03:26:02.120]  and that it's not an idea from a particular part of the world. It's an international standard.
[03:26:03.400 --> 03:26:08.840]  He says that the state has an obligation to adopt measures to eradicate such violence
[03:26:08.840 --> 03:26:15.960]  and discrimination, and notes that it continues to face opposition. The problem that we have here
[03:26:15.960 --> 03:26:23.560]  is what constitutes violence and discrimination in these people's view. All of this sounds great.
[03:26:23.560 --> 03:26:29.880]  Every sane person would say, of course, we don't want violence against anyone.
[03:26:31.960 --> 03:26:35.720]  Whether they're gay, straight, black, white, Chinese, it doesn't matter.
[03:26:37.160 --> 03:26:41.560]  We're all different. We're not going to commit violence against each other just because we
[03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:47.160]  disagree. But that's not what they're talking about when they say violence. They're talking
[03:26:47.160 --> 03:26:52.600]  about saying something that hurts someone's feelings, and that is provable.
[03:26:54.440 --> 03:27:01.240]  They also say that states' human rights obligations must be calibrated against
[03:27:01.880 --> 03:27:09.320]  the dominant religious and belief or cultural orthodoxies in national contexts.
[03:27:10.760 --> 03:27:22.280]  So he is calling for laws to be calibrated to disregard religion or cultural orthodoxies
[03:27:22.840 --> 03:27:34.520]  to incorporate and promote gay lifestyle, gay people, intersex people, transgender people,
[03:27:36.520 --> 03:27:44.360]  minor attracted persons, pedophiles. States' human rights obligations must be calibrated.
[03:27:44.360 --> 03:27:51.160]  It has to be against the dominant religion. States have to come against religions
[03:27:53.240 --> 03:27:59.960]  to incorporate acceptance of pedophiles into society, says the United Nations, essentially.
[03:28:02.520 --> 03:28:09.080]  The mandate has reviewed the robust evidentiary and theoretical bases that lead to the conclusion
[03:28:09.080 --> 03:28:18.760]  that these positions, which they say traditional values, public morals and national values,
[03:28:18.760 --> 03:28:25.480]  are commonly used in discourses that are hostile to women, LGBT persons and religious and belief
[03:28:25.480 --> 03:28:31.880]  minorities, and they often rely explicitly on religious and belief norms and values,
[03:28:32.600 --> 03:28:38.360]  which are, he says, linked with patriotism and patriarchal gender and family norms,
[03:28:39.320 --> 03:28:44.920]  and that these positions are not supported by international human rights. So the international
[03:28:44.920 --> 03:28:51.640]  human rights do not support patriotism, patriarchal gender and family norms or your
[03:28:51.640 --> 03:28:56.360]  religious freedoms. We'll keep going right on the other side of this break. Don't go anywhere. We'll
[03:28:56.360 --> 03:29:03.480]  be right back. When hope and love has been lost and you fall to the ground, you must find a way.
[03:29:05.320 --> 03:29:12.440]  When the darkness descends and you're told it's the end, you must find a way.
[03:29:12.440 --> 03:29:18.200]  When God decides to look the other way and a clown takes the throne, we must find a way.
[03:29:18.760 --> 03:29:25.640]  You will find a way. Dig down and find faith. When you're close to the edge
[03:29:26.680 --> 03:29:34.040]  with a gun to your head, you must find a way. We have entered the fray and we will not obey.
[03:29:34.760 --> 03:29:39.000]  We must find a way and find faith.
[03:29:44.120 --> 03:29:53.160]  We won't let them divide. We will never abide. We will find a way. IntroWars.com.

[03:30:24.600 --> 03:30:30.840]  size, normally $69.98. We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love doing
[03:30:30.840 --> 03:30:38.120]  best, producing and making the MyPillow. And the model of businessmen and women with can-do
[03:30:38.120 --> 03:30:43.560]  know-how, using the money for Americana freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear. That's
[03:30:43.560 --> 03:30:47.320]  what the debanking is about. That's what the financial attacks are about. That's why we've
[03:30:47.320 --> 03:30:52.600]  got a rush to support MyPillow.com and InfoWars.com, plus their great products at both places,
[03:30:52.600 --> 03:30:58.600]  because we are the tip of the spear. With all the craziness in the world,
[03:30:58.600 --> 03:31:04.520]  the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations,
[03:31:04.520 --> 03:31:08.840]  the economy going crazy, you are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high quality,

[03:33:31.840 --> 03:33:37.240]  We need InfoWars like we need air. All right, so the mandate of the United Nations Special
[03:33:37.240 --> 03:33:46.600]  Repertoire on Freedom of Religion or Belief, they talk about how there are two trains of
[03:33:46.600 --> 03:33:54.600]  thought here, which is that you don't have the right to control someone's belief systems,
[03:33:54.600 --> 03:34:02.000]  but it also says that the right to manifest one's religion or belief through actions
[03:34:02.000 --> 03:34:10.760]  can and should be limited by states in certain circumstances. So why would that have to be
[03:34:10.760 --> 03:34:16.600]  the case? Well, they talk about public safety, order, health, or morals, or the fundamental
[03:34:16.600 --> 03:34:20.360]  rights and freedoms of others. Again, I'm talking about the fact that you are not allowed
[03:34:20.360 --> 03:34:26.800]  to, according to these people, on the basis of your religion, your belief systems, criticise,
[03:34:26.800 --> 03:34:34.280]  admonish, offer advice. They talk about conversion practices here. You're not allowed to pray
[03:34:34.280 --> 03:34:40.080]  for someone. It's already illegal for a parent in the state of Victoria here in Australia,
[03:34:40.080 --> 03:34:45.800]  if their kid comes home and says, mum, I am really thinking that, you know, a female child,
[03:34:45.800 --> 03:34:51.080]  I'm really thinking that I might be a boy. If that family says, no, sweetie, you're not
[03:34:51.080 --> 03:34:56.480]  a boy, you're a girl, and I think you may be confused, let me pray for you, that parent
[03:34:56.480 --> 03:35:03.840]  can go to jail for 10 years. And then the school can take the child and go and get them
[03:35:03.840 --> 03:35:12.120]  butchered up by these Nazi doctors that take pleasure in cutting children's breasts off
[03:35:12.120 --> 03:35:18.880]  and adding fake genitals to them. And the school can do that on behalf of the parent
[03:35:18.880 --> 03:35:26.120]  while the parent rots in prison for trying to save their child from genital mutilation.
[03:35:26.120 --> 03:35:35.240]  That's already a law in Australia. So when they're talking about, you know, you don't
[03:35:35.240 --> 03:35:40.160]  really have a right to religious expression. You have a right to believe what you want,
[03:35:40.200 --> 03:35:46.600]  but you don't really have a right to express it. But when we have Pride Month, an entire
[03:35:46.600 --> 03:35:53.160]  month of displaying this depravity, standing on floats and whipping each other in front
[03:35:53.160 --> 03:35:59.400]  of children half naked, showing them, teaching them about BDSM and men in their underwear
[03:35:59.400 --> 03:36:04.000]  twerking in front of women, old men with saggy underwear, you all know the clip I'm talking
[03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:10.400]  about. That, that's okay. That freedom of expression is perfectly okay. The state doesn't
[03:36:10.400 --> 03:36:17.280]  intervene in that. Alex aired a clip from Rob Primo contacting the Canadian police during
[03:36:17.280 --> 03:36:21.440]  Pride Month. And the police essentially said to him, and I interviewed Rob about this not
[03:36:21.440 --> 03:36:25.760]  long after, the police essentially said to him, yeah, look, you know, during Pride Month
[03:36:25.760 --> 03:36:31.080]  we always kind of have this thing. Normally sexual exploitation in front of children is
[03:36:31.080 --> 03:36:38.680]  not okay, but during Pride Month it is what it is. Oh well. Thanks to the police for protecting
[03:36:38.680 --> 03:36:47.600]  our children from pedophilia and grooming. So it then talks about how freedom of opinion
[03:36:47.600 --> 03:36:55.600]  and expression is enshrined in, and it references a few articles here. I won't go into all the
[03:36:55.600 --> 03:37:02.800]  details, but it says the provisions are given context by article 20 of the covenant, which
[03:37:02.800 --> 03:37:10.360]  prohibits racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination,
[03:37:10.360 --> 03:37:17.960]  hostility or violence. So what we're talking about here is charging people or accusing
[03:37:17.960 --> 03:37:24.760]  them of inciting discrimination, hostility or violence and creating laws around it, which
[03:37:24.760 --> 03:37:34.280]  limit religious freedoms. What does it mean to incite discrimination, hostility or violence?
[03:37:34.280 --> 03:37:43.120]  Well, an example here is that it's saying that LGBT persons or the LGBT agenda is a
[03:37:43.120 --> 03:37:48.960]  threat to the traditional family or the nation is incitement to discrimination, hostility
[03:37:48.960 --> 03:37:59.080]  or violence. So let me just be really logical here. If everyone was gay and we didn't preserve
[03:37:59.080 --> 03:38:07.320]  traditional family values, we wouldn't have natural reproduction anymore. That's not hateful,
[03:38:07.320 --> 03:38:19.280]  that's just fact. If we were all gay, the human race wouldn't survive very long. But
[03:38:19.280 --> 03:38:25.160]  they have a solution for that, though. They're going to give you lab-grown babies. Either
[03:38:25.160 --> 03:38:30.240]  way, you're not allowed to say it according to these people, and if you claim that there
[03:38:30.240 --> 03:38:35.640]  are religious reasons why you think that way, the state should limit that freedom of your
[03:38:35.640 --> 03:38:41.200]  expression because it incites hatred and violence. So I'm going to go into what they
[03:38:41.200 --> 03:38:46.480]  actually constitute as hate speech in a moment. They say that the extent to which religion
[03:38:46.480 --> 03:38:50.440]  can be invoked for autocratic practices and denial of basic rights and civil liberties
[03:38:50.440 --> 03:38:56.480]  is also evident in some of the state legislators seeking to enshrine anti-trans exclusion and
[03:38:56.480 --> 03:39:03.280]  eliminate comprehensive sex education in the United States. So he's actually, and he says
[03:39:03.640 --> 03:39:09.800]  they're doing this for political purposes. So when a normal person who realizes that
[03:39:09.800 --> 03:39:20.880]  pedophilia is not so good says, hey, this book is pornographic in nature and shouldn't be viewed
[03:39:20.880 --> 03:39:25.760]  by children. We had this recently in Australia with a book called Welcome to Sex. It got pulled
[03:39:25.760 --> 03:39:31.600]  off the shelves of a major retailer after public backlash. And one of the authors said, I'd be
[03:39:31.600 --> 03:39:37.280]  perfectly comfortable with a mature eight-year-old viewing this book. And the book had
[03:39:37.280 --> 03:39:46.360]  explicit details on how to perform sexual acts, such as rimming and scissoring. I don't even want
[03:39:46.360 --> 03:39:52.360]  to go into it for you. It's too disgusting for even adults to talk about on air. But one of the
[03:39:52.360 --> 03:39:57.240]  authors said, yeah, a mature eight-year-old could view this. So that's perfectly okay,
[03:39:57.240 --> 03:39:59.080]  says the United Nations.
[03:39:59.500 --> 03:40:09.300]  And they're using the example of people eliminating what they call comprehensive sex education,
[03:40:09.300 --> 03:40:18.460]  which is porn, being given to children as an example of this hatred, violence, incitement
[03:40:18.460 --> 03:40:20.220]  to violence.
[03:40:20.220 --> 03:40:27.660]  And how dare they use religious values to encourage children to not be shown porn by
[03:40:27.660 --> 03:40:31.260]  mentally deranged teachers.
[03:40:31.260 --> 03:40:37.540]  So I want to focus on what the UN considers incitement to discrimination, okay?
[03:40:38.600 --> 03:40:46.200]  From the United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech report from May 2019,
[03:40:46.200 --> 03:40:47.880]  Antonio Guterres says,
[03:40:47.880 --> 03:40:52.520]  Hate speech is a menace to democratic values, social stability and peace.
[03:40:53.160 --> 03:40:57.640]  As a matter of principle, the United Nations must confront hate speech at every turn.
[03:40:58.280 --> 03:41:01.880]  Silence can signal indifference to bigotry and intolerance,
[03:41:01.880 --> 03:41:06.280]  even as a situation escalates and the vulnerable become victims.
[03:41:06.280 --> 03:41:11.560]  So really, you know, hate speech is such a menace and it can incite violence and,
[03:41:11.560 --> 03:41:14.360]  you know, it's something that we really care about.
[03:41:14.360 --> 03:41:17.480]  And we want to eliminate hate speech and so on and so forth.
[03:41:17.480 --> 03:41:18.680]  This is Guterres.
[03:41:18.680 --> 03:41:20.920]  You know, he cares so much about humanity.
[03:41:20.920 --> 03:41:23.000]  On page two, what is hate speech?
[03:41:23.560 --> 03:41:27.800]  There is no international legal definition of hate speech
[03:41:27.800 --> 03:41:31.720]  and the characterization of what is hateful is controversial and disputed.
[03:41:32.120 --> 03:41:34.840]  Guys, we need to eliminate hate speech.
[03:41:34.840 --> 03:41:37.800]  But there's no definition for hate speech.
[03:41:39.080 --> 03:41:45.320]  It's just whatever hurts the feelings of the pedophiles.
[03:41:48.040 --> 03:41:49.080]  That's what it is.
[03:41:50.440 --> 03:41:52.040]  And it actually says,
[03:41:54.280 --> 03:41:59.720]  any kind of communication in speech, writing or behavior that attacks or uses pejorative
[03:42:00.360 --> 03:42:07.400]  or discriminatory language with reference to a person or group on the basis of who they are.
[03:42:07.400 --> 03:42:12.200]  So if you don't agree with someone and you use pejorative language,
[03:42:12.200 --> 03:42:17.480]  which simply means to express contempt or disapproval, that's hate speech
[03:42:17.480 --> 03:42:23.480]  and constitutes incitement to violence, incitement to discrimination.
[03:42:24.680 --> 03:42:28.280]  There is no protection of religious speech in the same manner.
[03:42:28.760 --> 03:42:36.120]  When people go around mocking my Lord Jesus, there's no one stopping that, are they?
[03:42:36.120 --> 03:42:41.080]  No one's saying that's incitement to religious hatred and potential acts of violence.
[03:42:42.360 --> 03:42:49.400]  No, but if I use language that expresses my disapproval of pedophilia,
[03:42:49.400 --> 03:42:52.120]  I'm inciting discrimination towards maps.
[03:42:52.840 --> 03:42:53.880]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:53.880 --> 03:42:56.920]  We'll continue and finish this report on the other side of this break.
[03:42:56.920 --> 03:43:04.040]  I beg you to think about how important your word of mouth is and you sharing the articles

[03:45:38.920 --> 03:45:43.400]  using the money for Americana freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[03:45:43.400 --> 03:45:44.920]  That's what the debanking is about.
[03:45:44.920 --> 03:45:46.760]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[03:45:46.760 --> 03:45:49.800]  That's why we've got to rush to support MyPillow.com.

[03:46:58.200 --> 03:47:02.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:02.760 --> 03:47:05.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.900 --> 03:47:16.940]  Before I read you some of the conclusions of this report, I just want to note what they
[03:47:16.940 --> 03:47:23.380]  call other forms of oppression, and they give an example of how a Russian law in 2013 that
[03:47:23.380 --> 03:47:30.420]  banned propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations to minors is an example of censorship
[03:47:30.420 --> 03:47:37.619]  legislation that limits freedom of expression about LGBT topics, and is reliant upon protection
[03:47:37.619 --> 03:47:39.420]  of religiously derived traditional values.
[03:47:39.420 --> 03:47:48.900]  So they're saying that this is oppression, not teaching children about gay sex is oppression,
[03:47:48.900 --> 03:47:53.740]  and that's an example of how religious institutions are oppressing gay people because they're
[03:47:53.740 --> 03:47:59.500]  not teaching children about gay sex or pedophile sex.
[03:47:59.500 --> 03:48:03.859]  This is what these people mean by this language.
[03:48:03.859 --> 03:48:05.180]  They want your children.
[03:48:05.180 --> 03:48:06.420]  They want your children.
[03:48:06.420 --> 03:48:09.420]  I'm going to prove it to you in a moment.
[03:48:09.420 --> 03:48:15.699]  Very quickly, the recommendations that this independent expert has made is to carry out
[03:48:15.699 --> 03:48:23.539]  necessary analysis and reform to ensure that legislation and public policy complies with
[03:48:23.539 --> 03:48:27.900]  the human rights standards, including these principles of non-discrimination, making sure
[03:48:27.900 --> 03:48:34.340]  we can keep teaching kids about gay sex, ensuring that any law or public policy relating to
[03:48:34.340 --> 03:48:41.340]  the frameworks of religious exemptions or conscientious objection is compatible with
[03:48:41.340 --> 03:48:47.260]  human rights standards and does not negate the access of LGBT and other gender diverse
[03:48:47.260 --> 03:48:50.380]  persons.
[03:48:50.380 --> 03:48:57.380]  So making sure that there are no public policies or laws that allow religious people to say
[03:48:57.380 --> 03:49:02.300]  we don't think that this is correct, we don't think that pedophilia is correct, we base
[03:49:02.300 --> 03:49:04.220]  that belief on our religious values.
[03:49:04.220 --> 03:49:05.220]  No, no, no.
[03:49:05.220 --> 03:49:11.820]  We need to change laws and public policies to make sure that we legalise pedophilia.
[03:49:11.820 --> 03:49:15.080]  This is what the goal is, the ultimate goal.
[03:49:15.080 --> 03:49:16.740]  As I said, I'm going to prove it to you in a moment.
[03:49:16.740 --> 03:49:22.500]  Team, if you can queue up the 8 March principles, we'll look at that in one second.
[03:49:22.500 --> 03:49:28.020]  For the bodily autonomy and sexual and reproductive health and rights of LGBT and gender diverse
[03:49:28.020 --> 03:49:34.260]  persons as well as comprehensive sexuality and gender education.
[03:49:34.300 --> 03:49:46.099]  They're talking about children here, comprehensive sexuality and gender education, working in
[03:49:46.099 --> 03:49:53.420]  collaboration with feminists, which the modern day feminist movement is full of wackos, absolute
[03:49:53.420 --> 03:50:00.300]  loose cannons, mentally unstable victim mentality women who are seriously an embarrassment to
[03:50:00.300 --> 03:50:01.300]  women.
[03:50:01.300 --> 03:50:02.300]  You don't see any of them standing up.
[03:50:02.300 --> 03:50:08.939]  They'll go and scream in the streets for the rights to murder their child and do it repeatedly,
[03:50:08.939 --> 03:50:13.259]  but they won't scream in the streets to stop men from competing in women's sports.
[03:50:13.259 --> 03:50:16.420]  You should be ashamed of yourselves.
[03:50:16.420 --> 03:50:22.900]  Working in collaboration with feminists and LGBT-led and LGBT-serving civil society, including
[03:50:22.900 --> 03:50:28.699]  religious groups who work on an inclusive basis, so working only with religious groups
[03:50:28.699 --> 03:50:33.220]  to push out our propaganda, which is the ultimate goal, is to be able to have sex
[03:50:33.220 --> 03:50:37.259]  with children, working with religious groups that are going to help us push that.
[03:50:37.259 --> 03:50:38.820]  That's what they're saying here.
[03:50:38.820 --> 03:50:43.740]  They're not going to work with all religious groups to try and engage them.
[03:50:43.740 --> 03:50:48.539]  No, no, no, we're going to push the ones who agree with this and will help us push this
[03:50:48.539 --> 03:50:51.939]  message out and criminalize anyone else who doesn't agree.
[03:50:52.000 --> 03:51:00.760]  They're saying that you need to refrain from justifying with religious narratives.
[03:51:00.760 --> 03:51:05.120]  They're telling religious leaders they have to refrain from justifying with religious
[03:51:05.120 --> 03:51:12.200]  narratives any act of violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
[03:51:12.200 --> 03:51:17.200]  Again what they're talking about here, when they say violence, it's disapproval.
[03:51:17.200 --> 03:51:19.120]  That's what they're saying.
[03:51:19.120 --> 03:51:24.240]  And they actually say that faith-based leaders have to condemn this, they have to condemn
[03:51:24.240 --> 03:51:33.080]  any type of disapproval towards LGBT people and examine the historical role of how religious
[03:51:33.080 --> 03:51:40.280]  institutions have contributed to the perpetration of human rights violations.
[03:51:40.280 --> 03:51:43.440]  I'm going to show you the 8 March Principles right now.
[03:51:43.440 --> 03:51:48.400]  This is a report that was published by the International Commission of Jurists, Advocates
[03:51:48.400 --> 03:51:54.720]  for Justice and Human Rights with support of the United Nations.
[03:51:54.720 --> 03:52:03.760]  And in Principle 18 it says this, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.
[03:52:03.760 --> 03:52:07.320]  It says here that no one may be held criminally liable.
[03:52:07.320 --> 03:52:13.360]  This is page 27 of the PDF, guys, so that you can bring it up for everyone.
[03:52:13.360 --> 03:52:19.640]  Principle 18, no one may be held criminally liable for conduct or status based on their
[03:52:19.640 --> 03:52:21.840]  gender identity or gender expression.
[03:52:21.840 --> 03:52:23.520]  What does that actually mean?
[03:52:23.520 --> 03:52:29.240]  In their terms, the decoded language here is no one can be held criminally liable for
[03:52:29.240 --> 03:52:38.240]  their conduct based on their gender expression, which is, to them, gender identities and forms
[03:52:38.240 --> 03:52:44.120]  of gender expression that are perceived not to conform to societal expectations or norms
[03:52:44.120 --> 03:52:49.080]  relating to gender roles, the sex assigned to a person at birth or a male-female binary
[03:52:49.080 --> 03:52:50.080]  among others.
[03:52:50.080 --> 03:52:51.080]  What are the others?
[03:52:51.080 --> 03:52:52.080]  That is pedophiles.
[03:52:52.080 --> 03:52:56.880]  So they're saying no one may be held criminally liable.
[03:52:56.880 --> 03:53:04.360]  The decoded language here is if they have sex with minors, because this is their sexual expression.
[03:53:04.360 --> 03:53:09.720]  They go on to say no one may be held criminally liable for consensual practices aiming to
[03:53:09.720 --> 03:53:16.240]  assist others with the exploration, pre-development and or affirmation of sexual orientation or
[03:53:16.240 --> 03:53:20.760]  gender identity unless there was forced coercion, fraud or medical negligence.
[03:53:20.760 --> 03:53:24.120]  So what do they say here?
[03:53:24.120 --> 03:53:28.920]  They're saying no one can be held criminally liable, this is what they're advocating for,
[03:53:28.920 --> 03:53:33.240]  for consensual practices.
[03:53:33.240 --> 03:53:36.280]  So what is the consensual practice?
[03:53:36.000 --> 03:53:47.160]  I've gone to Principle 18, Tim, can you go up to Principle 16, which is consensual sexual
[03:53:47.160 --> 03:53:48.160]  conduct?
[03:53:48.160 --> 03:53:57.000]  They say that consensual sexual conduct, irrespective of the type of sexual activity, the sex, gender,
[03:53:57.000 --> 03:54:01.160]  sexual orientation, meaning pedophile, gender identity and gender expression of the people
[03:54:01.160 --> 03:54:07.680]  involved or their marital status may not be criminalized in any circumstances, okay? Consensual
[03:54:07.680 --> 03:54:14.400]  same sex, and they go on to talk about all these sorts of things outside of marriage,
[03:54:14.400 --> 03:54:19.560]  so on and so forth, look at this, moreover, sexual conduct involving persons below the
[03:54:19.560 --> 03:54:27.160]  domestically prescribed minimum age of consent to sex may be consensual, in fact, if not
[03:54:27.160 --> 03:54:32.580]  in law. In this context, the enforcement of criminal law should reflect the rights
[03:54:32.580 --> 03:54:39.960]  and capacity of persons under 18 years of age to make decisions about engaging in consensual
[03:54:39.960 --> 03:54:47.480]  sexual conduct and their right to be heard in matters concerning them. Pursuant to their
[03:54:47.480 --> 03:54:53.720]  evolving capacities and progressive autonomy, persons under 18 years of age should participate
[03:54:53.720 --> 03:54:57.440]  in decisions affecting them with due regard to their age, maturity and best interests,
[03:54:57.440 --> 03:55:03.400]  so on and so forth. So people, we come down to the crux of the issue. You have the United
[03:55:03.400 --> 03:55:11.680]  Nations coming and saying you cannot discriminate and you cannot use as a religious person pejorative
[03:55:11.680 --> 03:55:22.080]  language to defend your right to traditional values, to stand against pedophilia. You can't
[03:55:22.080 --> 03:55:28.400]  do that anymore, and moreover, according to the 8 March Principles, the international
[03:55:28.400 --> 03:55:39.199]  Commission of Jurists, people under the age of 18 can consent to sex, any forms of sex,
[03:55:39.199 --> 03:55:41.039]  with anyone of any age.
[03:55:41.039 --> 03:55:46.279]  It doesn't give an age limit here, it doesn't say, you know, 12 to 18, not that I'm saying
[03:55:46.279 --> 03:55:52.359]  that 12 is okay either, I'm just saying, it's saying anyone.
[03:55:52.359 --> 03:55:57.279]  So when you have freaks, like the guy who started the transgender movement, who used
[03:55:57.279 --> 03:56:05.760]  to rape babies, saying that because they're flashed in the face, that's a sign of consent,
[03:56:05.760 --> 03:56:08.000]  this is where we're heading, people.
[03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:10.520]  The answer is that we need to exit the United Nations.
[03:56:10.520 --> 03:56:13.640]  We've had some huge, huge wins recently.
[03:56:13.640 --> 03:56:18.680]  We have the local mainstream media in Florida talking about the fact that these shots are
[03:56:18.680 --> 03:56:19.880]  a bioweapon.
[03:56:19.880 --> 03:56:26.640]  We've got the British Rowing Society banning males from competing in women's sports.
[03:56:26.640 --> 03:56:31.920]  We have a lot of good wins coming up all over the world.
[03:56:31.920 --> 03:56:36.920]  We've had major wins in Australia pushing back on some of these laws that seek to stop
[03:56:36.920 --> 03:56:41.160]  us from using our own land.
[03:56:41.160 --> 03:56:45.180]  People are waking up, people are rising up, and the one thing that people need to wake
[03:56:45.180 --> 03:56:51.900]  up to today, today, is that we must exit the United Nations.
[03:56:51.900 --> 03:56:59.100]  You want to know where this push to sexualize your children comes from, with the ultimate
[03:56:59.100 --> 03:57:03.779]  goal of being able to legally have sex with your children?
[03:57:03.779 --> 03:57:13.100]  Look, no further than the puppet masters who run the United Nations, but as a bare minimum,
[03:57:13.100 --> 03:57:16.359]  call for the exit of the United Nations.
[03:57:16.359 --> 03:57:19.060]  These people are advocating for pedophilia.
[03:57:19.060 --> 03:57:24.340]  They are seeking to exterminate religion, and it is because they serve Satan.
[03:57:24.340 --> 03:57:29.820]  So on the final note, where they say that speaking the truth is an act of war, well, let's do
[03:57:29.820 --> 03:57:30.820]  war, baby.
[03:57:30.820 --> 03:57:36.100]  Jesus Christ is Lord, and there is nothing that will ever, ever stop me from saying that.
[03:57:36.100 --> 03:57:37.359]  You best believe it.
[03:57:37.359 --> 03:57:38.900]  The truth is the truth.
[03:57:38.900 --> 03:57:40.859]  You are liars.
[03:57:40.859 --> 03:57:41.859]  And that's the end of that.
[03:57:41.859 --> 03:57:42.859]  God bless you all.
[03:57:42.859 --> 03:57:43.859]  Thank you so much.

[03:58:06.300 --> 03:58:07.460]  from there.
