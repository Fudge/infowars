[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:33.040]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.040 --> 00:39.160]  seems like five seconds ago it was last Friday we just gotten back from
[00:39.160 --> 00:43.360]  Bilderberg a few days previous and it seemed like five seconds before that it
[00:43.360 --> 00:47.040]  was the middle of Bilderberg the Friday before last but here we are
[00:47.040 --> 00:53.320]  hurtling forward in the time space continuum it is Friday the 15th day of
[00:53.320 --> 01:03.440]  June 2012 and we are going to be here live for the next three hours there's a
[01:03.440 --> 01:10.760]  video that is posted at info wars.com of Luke Radowski nicely for six and a
[01:10.760 --> 01:15.040]  half minutes following Rand Paul down the street Senator Paul asking him
[01:15.040 --> 01:19.360]  questions and Paul who in the past has stopped many times and talked to Luke and
[01:19.360 --> 01:24.400]  badmouth the Bilderberg group in the New World Order just wouldn't talk to him and
[01:24.400 --> 01:28.200]  so we're going to work on getting Luke Radowski popping in later in the third
[01:28.200 --> 01:32.280]  hour maybe on the nightly news tonight we have James Wesley Rawls joining us on
[01:32.280 --> 01:36.960]  the nightly news this evening and something hit me when I was watching a
[01:36.960 --> 01:42.240]  video because Luke was being very respectful friendly Paul's body language
[01:42.240 --> 01:46.080]  was very politician-esque and then without saying anything when I got her
[01:46.080 --> 01:50.480]  this morning Darren McBreen walked up to me and he said have you seen that video
[01:50.480 --> 01:55.560]  his body language all of it looks just like how Barbara Boxer at acts whenever
[01:55.560 --> 02:02.480]  Luke talks to her and I said yeah and I I had this epiphany this morning we need
[02:02.480 --> 02:09.600]  to be nice to Rand Paul because he is saying you know ban the drones got to
[02:09.600 --> 02:14.640]  have warrants don't have the military operating domestically states rights all
[02:14.640 --> 02:21.680]  these good things second amendment because if we are too mean to Rand Paul
[02:21.680 --> 02:27.680]  and by the way Luke wasn't I I'm realizing that he's the type that that
[02:27.680 --> 02:31.760]  will drive him into the arms of the emperor you know yeah I mean if you're
[02:31.760 --> 02:38.200]  too too mean to and that will drive him into the arms of the system but
[02:38.200 --> 02:44.480]  definitely he's listening too much to the mainline political advisors and we
[02:44.480 --> 02:51.880]  need to we need to keep the polls I mean because even if Rand Paul is not
[02:51.880 --> 02:55.280]  perfect endorses Mitt Romney he's a lot better than other people and see I get
[02:55.280 --> 02:59.280]  that's the same political idea of well hey let's endorse Mitt Romney I mean you
[02:59.280 --> 03:04.560]  know he's not Obama no it's it's not the same we understand that's bad it's
[03:04.560 --> 03:08.720]  upsetting I've now had a week this the stuff broke last Thursday night so over
[03:08.720 --> 03:12.120]  a week I learned about it Friday morning so it's been a week I had time to
[03:12.120 --> 03:18.080]  cogitate and kind of mull it over and let's just not go crazy on Rand because
[03:18.080 --> 03:24.840]  I started seeing comments at info wars calm daily Paul calm and on YouTube
[03:24.840 --> 03:30.600]  without even looking because I was kind of scan over him saying oh he voted for
[03:30.600 --> 03:36.860]  the NDA a how dare him and boy Luke should bring that up and Alex needs to
[03:36.860 --> 03:42.100]  bring this up and I went wait a minute he voted against the NDA a twice so
[03:42.100 --> 03:48.100]  I went to Thomas loc.gov and I typed in the bill number and he was only one
[03:48.100 --> 03:56.160]  actually printed off here of one two three four five six seven people that
[03:56.160 --> 04:01.560]  voted against it both times in the Senate so now it's entering this phase
[04:01.560 --> 04:05.920]  because people they're so upset and I understand why of the system being able
[04:05.920 --> 04:12.680]  to inject dis info against the polls that never stuck that is now sticking
[04:12.680 --> 04:19.840]  Rand Paul voted against the NDA a okay and Ron Paul right after 9-11
[04:19.840 --> 04:24.680]  authorizing force to go after bin Laden when almost no one but myself was
[04:24.680 --> 04:29.320]  questioning the official story he can't blame Ron Paul for that saying okay I
[04:29.320 --> 04:34.080]  vote for force to go after bin Laden but then he was against the Afghan Iraq
[04:34.080 --> 04:38.440]  wars and all that so the spin that Ron Paul's pro-war to it's a bunch of baloney
[04:38.440 --> 04:42.240]  he would have been much more popular back in 08 if he'd have gone with all
[04:42.240 --> 04:46.560]  that so we got to be careful here and I know I got emotional and got angry and
[04:46.560 --> 04:52.160]  I've seen a lot of bad stuff out of the whole Paul ain't camp but that doesn't
[04:52.160 --> 04:57.000]  mean they're the enemy there are friends and we don't want this to go too far

[07:03.320 --> 07:07.280]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[07:07.280 --> 07:11.520]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[07:11.520 --> 07:15.800]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[07:15.800 --> 07:20.160]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[07:20.160 --> 07:24.280]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[07:24.280 --> 07:28.800]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:28.800 --> 07:32.920]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:32.920 --> 07:36.920]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[07:36.920 --> 07:40.720]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:40.720 --> 07:43.440]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[07:59.880 --> 08:05.400]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[08:05.400 --> 08:22.280]  because there's a war on for your mind
[08:22.280 --> 08:26.200]  all right ladies and gentlemen of extremely important as it is every day
[08:26.200 --> 08:29.800]  but it's more important as we get deeper into global tyranny very important
[08:29.800 --> 08:34.080]  Friday edition here we're gonna have open phones we're also going to have some
[08:34.080 --> 08:39.240]  breaking news here dealing with secret nuclear reactors in Austin Texas and
[08:39.240 --> 08:44.280]  reports of illegal dumping of that material including where it is
[08:44.280 --> 08:49.400]  reportedly deposited this is a big information and it deals with this entire
[08:49.400 --> 08:53.840]  country this entire world governments universities everywhere just bury it
[08:53.840 --> 08:58.680]  under the universities bury it out in the middle of Cal pastures and it just
[08:58.680 --> 09:03.960]  it's part of this craziness that's going on now I want to show people watching on
[09:03.960 --> 09:08.560]  prison planet TV obviously if you're listening on the radio you can just go
[09:08.560 --> 09:13.920]  there the top of the drudge report and and couldn't say it better myself this
[09:13.920 --> 09:16.560]  is what I thought this morning when I saw it before I even went to drudge
[09:16.560 --> 09:20.520]  report dot com or info wars dot com for that matter two places I obviously go
[09:20.520 --> 09:26.400]  multiple times every hour who needs Congress Obama to grant immunity to
[09:26.400 --> 09:31.680]  young illegals oh it's for young people so it's okay and of course free federally
[09:31.680 --> 09:39.440]  funded supplemental tuition and welfare and everything else now let's stop right
[09:39.440 --> 09:46.040]  there I have Kurt Nemo doing a report will be ready in the next few hours where
[09:46.040 --> 09:52.880]  we go over the fact that Obama is becoming a dictator and on this front the
[09:52.880 --> 09:56.240]  Republicans have done almost nothing because when somebody like Mitt Romney
[09:56.240 --> 10:01.080]  gets in they're gonna want those powers let's be clear I oppose dictatorial
[10:01.080 --> 10:08.000]  activity under Bill Clinton George W. Bush, Barack Hussein, Mary Cetero, Obama
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.120]  whatever his real name is and under Mitt Romney and and it looks like the wind
[10:12.120 --> 10:16.200]  is turning against Mitt Romney not just in conservatives and libertarians and
[10:16.200 --> 10:20.800]  some mainline liberals but also in the power structure itself and I would love
[10:20.800 --> 10:23.200]  to believe that there's a lot at the end of the tunnel but what if it's an
[10:23.200 --> 10:29.200]  oncoming train that said Obama could launch a new war he could stage a new
[10:29.200 --> 10:33.240]  terror attack I mean after all a bunch of Democrats of like Robert Shapiro
[10:33.240 --> 10:37.120]  over it in the Financial Times of London that a new Oklahoma City or 9-11
[10:37.120 --> 10:41.840]  would help him get reelected I mean they put out fundraising memos even Fox
[10:41.840 --> 10:48.160]  News has covered that so Obama is the number one danger right now because he
[10:48.160 --> 10:52.400]  is in power he is in control of the national security apparatus and that
[10:52.400 --> 10:58.520]  means the Chicago mafia and the Bankster mafia is in control of it as well and I
[10:58.520 --> 11:00.440]  was just talking to Curt Nimmo during the break I said I want you to do an
[11:00.440 --> 11:04.240]  article on this that ties into the story that's up on Drudge that's also in
[11:04.240 --> 11:08.520]  infowars.com the whole cornucopia of stories where they're not just saying
[11:08.520 --> 11:11.840]  they're gonna legalize illegals and by the way that came out years ago people
[11:11.840 --> 11:16.960]  and I went public and said when we do these raids on meat packing plants and
[11:16.960 --> 11:20.600]  things and arrest you know a thousand plus illegals almost every employee is
[11:20.600 --> 11:24.880]  illegal and no citizen can even dare have a job because a lot of times the
[11:24.880 --> 11:28.000]  illegals when this once they run a factory won't even allow anybody else in
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.800]  there won't work with them that's actually come out in the newspapers so
[11:31.800 --> 11:35.200]  it's a reverse discrimination plus you can't even communicate with them in
[11:35.200 --> 11:39.700]  most cases so again there's the issue they won't even I've seen articles in
[11:39.700 --> 11:43.600]  Los Angeles where Hispanics can't even get jobs that they don't speak good
[11:43.600 --> 11:49.040]  Spanish working at restaurants or in janitorial things just because there's
[11:49.040 --> 11:56.600]  the communication gap but that's a side issue the point is that you've got 30
[11:56.600 --> 12:01.600]  plus million illegals in this country not 11 not 14 not 20 Mexico has
[12:01.600 --> 12:06.160]  collapsed through the narco terrorism and the globalist they're collapsing this
[12:06.160 --> 12:12.040]  country as well we're all victims of the new world order operation and Obama
[12:12.040 --> 12:16.560]  just says hey I'll do this by fiat we told you years ago that was coming this
[12:16.560 --> 12:20.760]  is just out in the open because he shuts down power plants not owned by
[12:20.760 --> 12:28.440]  general electric through executive fiat Axelrod came out last week in fact
[12:28.440 --> 12:33.840]  guys I just printed that article bring it into me thank you came out and said
[12:33.840 --> 12:38.240]  we'll just we'll just pass an amendment to restrict free speech we'll make
[12:38.240 --> 12:43.080]  reporters have government-issued laptops we'll have the bureaucracy say
[12:43.080 --> 12:48.320]  your kids can't do chores at home or on the farm or anywhere we'll let your
[12:48.320 --> 12:52.520]  kids sue you you can't spank them it's the state totally waging war
[12:52.520 --> 12:59.000]  criminally on everyone now here's the article Obama plans attack on the first
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.640]  amendment of reelected hurt memo that came out last week almost got no
[13:02.640 --> 13:06.600]  attention he links to Axelrod statements all of it incredibly important
[13:06.600 --> 13:11.080]  article and there it is David Axelrod talks with John Hellerman
[13:11.080 --> 13:16.680]  constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united I mean I mean this is
[13:16.680 --> 13:22.200]  just amazing this is amazing but it's not amazing when you know history and
[13:22.200 --> 13:25.160]  know that this is part for the course with tyrannies once they get out of
[13:25.160 --> 13:29.280]  control so he shuts down power plants that aren't owned by his buddies outside
[13:29.280 --> 13:34.480]  of congressional law carbon taxes without Congress launches wars without
[13:34.480 --> 13:38.080]  congressional approval in Libya and now supporting forces attacking al-Qaeda
[13:38.080 --> 13:42.360]  forces attacking Assad and Syria tells Congress when they're confronted
[13:42.360 --> 13:50.520]  repeatedly tells them over and over and over again that we'll just basically do
[13:50.520 --> 13:55.040]  whatever we want and that Congress isn't over war making anymore and by the way
[13:55.040 --> 13:58.400]  Congress isn't over the issuance of currency and credit and we'll just do
[13:58.400 --> 14:02.560]  whatever we want and the ATF is now issuing rules they said last year we're
[14:02.560 --> 14:05.480]  not just going to make people report more than two guns sold even though they
[14:05.480 --> 14:09.480]  know they're already reported under next outside of law we're going to ban shot
[14:09.480 --> 14:15.000]  guns remember that rulemaking last year that got defeated because of backlash but
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.960]  not in Congress they ATF criminal organization backed off but it was in
[14:19.960 --> 14:24.960]  the news they said most shot guns could have a clip added and we say that's not
[14:24.960 --> 14:29.280]  for sporting function that's the ATF says there's no right to self-defense of
[14:29.280 --> 14:33.680]  the Second Amendment so there's no sporting function so we're going to ban
[14:33.680 --> 14:38.360]  most shotguns it was over 60% of shotguns if they're bottom-loading you can
[14:38.360 --> 14:44.600]  just have you know single shot or double barrel that you crack open anything
[14:44.600 --> 14:49.160]  that you load into a tube it's over as it can be converted to have a clip no law
[14:49.160 --> 14:54.920]  they just say in fact there's no law saying they can look at us with drones
[14:54.920 --> 15:01.560]  without warrants there's no law saying the TSA can be out of their jurisdiction
[15:01.560 --> 15:06.320]  when they're not even police officers or sworn federal officers groping people
[15:06.320 --> 15:12.520]  something an FBI agent can't do but they say they can do it's all a lawlessness
[15:12.520 --> 15:17.640]  it's a total lawlessness I mean Obama came out and said I'm gonna give waivers
[15:17.640 --> 15:24.640]  to my own health care law to 2100 plus major companies that give me political
[15:24.640 --> 15:29.840]  contributions but their competition a factory a restaurant an auto dealership
[15:29.840 --> 15:35.180]  their competition they've got to get the health care and again who wrote that
[15:35.180 --> 15:39.560]  Mitt Romney who's he worked for big banks big insurance companies it's not
[15:39.560 --> 15:44.800]  socialist health care as if that's bad enough it's even worse it's just a total
[15:44.800 --> 15:53.160]  fraud written by the insurance company so here we are as a society now and so I
[15:53.160 --> 15:57.640]  told Kurt you know go with the headline basically that Obama is a dictator the
[15:57.640 --> 16:03.200]  office of the presidency is becoming a dictatorship because the special interests
[16:03.200 --> 16:08.920]  want it that way and I mean a federal court ruled the NDAA is unconstitutional
[16:08.920 --> 16:14.040]  to kill or disappear citizens without due process even domestically and the
[16:14.040 --> 16:18.480]  feds have said we don't care that that is the the mafia that runs the executive
[16:18.480 --> 16:24.320]  in the bureaucracy we're gonna keep doing it the courts are ignored the
[16:24.320 --> 16:29.080]  Congress that makes the laws and funds the most powerful it's ignored and they
[16:29.080 --> 16:33.400]  want to be ignored Congress wants to sit up there and be a bunch of paid
[16:33.400 --> 16:42.200]  prostitutes of the system and it makes me want to throw up yeah who needs
[16:42.200 --> 16:48.920]  Congress anymore in this country who needs it who needs any of it if the
[16:48.920 --> 16:54.520]  system just decides it can do whatever it wants the bureaucracy the minions you
[16:54.520 --> 16:59.640]  know I thought about the fact that there are still running secret nuclear reactor
[16:59.640 --> 17:02.400]  I mean you can actually find a few articles and I'm sending Aaron to the
[17:02.400 --> 17:06.560]  microfilm to dig up older ones from the 80s admitting there's a reactor my dad
[17:06.560 --> 17:12.360]  at UT it was no secret in the 60s they'll they'll say we're gonna arrest you
[17:12.360 --> 17:15.880]  and you're a conspiracy theorist if you ask about it now they've got two
[17:15.880 --> 17:19.600]  reactors up north at the JJ Pickle Center they don't deny that but no one
[17:19.600 --> 17:24.760]  knows about it literally one out of a thousand people might or I live and I'm
[17:24.760 --> 17:28.120]  talking to a fellow whose great-grandfather until 1970 was the
[17:28.120 --> 17:33.160]  head of all of the facilities at the University of Texas at Austin biggest
[17:33.160 --> 17:36.720]  campus in the world and we go out there and there's all the walled up concrete
[17:36.720 --> 17:40.320]  areas on the state preserve that's exactly where they've caught other
[17:40.320 --> 17:44.360]  governments and universities hiding stuff is in caves because nobody wants it
[17:44.360 --> 17:48.280]  their backyard and this has been out now for over a day we first put it on at
[17:48.280 --> 17:56.720]  some Thursday night then yesterday the reports at info wars.com link in red in
[17:56.720 --> 18:02.200]  fact I'll pull up info wars.com in front of me to give you the actual headline and
[18:02.200 --> 18:05.880]  I I bet unless people make a big noise about this there won't be an
[18:05.880 --> 18:11.800]  investigation you know why because because I believe my source I know about
[18:11.800 --> 18:15.840]  the reactors I know about others doing this I know about all the weird activity
[18:15.840 --> 18:19.160]  how it's fenced in over there but the other preserves aren't this is exactly
[18:19.160 --> 18:24.600]  how government operates in fact the word is Berkstrom's got nuclear garbage it
[18:24.600 --> 18:28.760]  used to be the big shack base you know what all these plants from Japan to
[18:28.760 --> 18:32.640]  Europe the United States they store the rods now on top of the reactors that's
[18:32.640 --> 18:35.040]  what happened to Fukushima remember what happened when the radiation levels
[18:35.040 --> 18:39.440]  went up and the tuna came in radioactive they they raised some isotopes to say
[18:39.440 --> 18:44.280]  they were safe at 100,000 times what they said they previously were others
[18:44.280 --> 18:50.120]  25 times 250 times just oh you know what radiations up in the United States
[18:50.120 --> 18:56.040]  blowing over from something much bigger than Chernobyl everything's fine because
[18:56.040 --> 19:01.760]  we raise the level we say it's safe for the troops to use DU wasn't until 1990
[19:01.760 --> 19:08.520]  we say it is yeah there is there's Kurt Nemo's article he actually had a blurb
[19:08.520 --> 19:12.480]  on it last week but there it is a new article out Obama plans attack on First
[19:12.480 --> 19:17.960]  Amendment if reelected amazing story and then under that breaking massive
[19:17.960 --> 19:22.760]  nuclear secrets uncovered in Austin Texas and you know I've got an old
[19:22.760 --> 19:28.680]  Geiger counter and I and I need to get like it's more like a spectrometer because
[19:28.680 --> 19:32.600]  it's way back there under the concrete up in those caves that go for miles but
[19:32.600 --> 19:37.040]  I mean I'm gonna go out there I'm I'm warning the system I'm coming and I'm
[19:37.040 --> 19:42.880]  getting into those caves I and I'm gonna I'm gonna get in there just I mean I
[19:42.880 --> 19:45.760]  know they might send a hit team after me by the way they've killed a lot of
[19:45.760 --> 19:49.280]  researchers that look into hidden nuke dumps and we're risking our life here so
[19:49.280 --> 19:53.160]  pray for us we and other people to look into what's reportedly over at Redbud I
[19:53.160 --> 19:57.200]  hope his great-grandfather was mistaken but this needs to be investigated right

[24:26.680 --> 24:39.820]  okay coming up the next segment we're gonna air part of a 19-minute news
[24:39.820 --> 24:44.480]  briefing that we first aired on the info wars nightly news last night breaking
[24:44.480 --> 24:50.760]  massive nuclear secret uncovered in Austin Texas and we've dug up the
[24:50.760 --> 24:55.120]  Austin American statesman the Associated Press admitting that there was a
[24:55.120 --> 24:59.840]  nuclear reactor under UT and it's still there but you don't find articles past
[24:59.840 --> 25:03.400]  the 80s I'm actually getting emails from people saying there was never a
[25:03.400 --> 25:09.960]  reactor under UT and people deny on the street that there's even a smaller and
[25:09.960 --> 25:14.480]  then a larger research reactor at the JJ pickle facility that's on the UT
[25:14.480 --> 25:21.080]  website I mean it's just amazing that people can't even admit that's real and
[25:21.080 --> 25:25.480]  then we have our source by the way there were cases but they call it the
[25:25.480 --> 25:30.560]  Silent Spring and other systems where you know the fish from Austin all the
[25:30.560 --> 25:35.000]  way to the Gulf of Mexico got killed decades ago when something got released
[25:35.000 --> 25:43.120]  into it okay and this all started three days ago when we KXAN reported on some
[25:43.120 --> 25:48.680]  type of cyclotron army weapon accelerator railgun system out of UT
[25:48.680 --> 25:54.760]  research facility outside Austin blew up and shot shrapnel into a car going down
[25:54.760 --> 25:59.240]  a country road hundreds and hundreds of yards oh it looks at the property the
[25:59.240 --> 26:02.720]  research facility it looks like it's a half mile off the road it was an
[26:02.720 --> 26:07.640]  explosion but the army says it's contained okay I live here my family's
[26:07.640 --> 26:11.240]  from here on my mother's side there's underground bases there's underground
[26:11.240 --> 26:16.920]  bases at Berkstrom my dad was in taking physics at UT in the late 60s he went
[26:16.920 --> 26:22.840]  and saw the nuclear reactor I have the Austin American statesmen it people
[26:22.840 --> 26:26.920]  can't even agree that's maybe three mile island doesn't exist maybe Fukushima
[26:26.920 --> 26:33.360]  doesn't exist the big issue is one of our crew members piped up and said oh
[26:33.360 --> 26:41.240]  yeah my great-grandfather was the head of UT facilities and he said that they
[26:41.240 --> 26:45.440]  went with transportation and put it in these caves owned by the state over by
[26:45.440 --> 26:50.720]  the dam we went over there and we're investigating that's what's really big
[26:50.720 --> 26:54.880]  but who knows maybe I've got to get people to maybe there's not a UT tower
[26:54.880 --> 26:59.720]  maybe there's no UT longhorns maybe I don't exist maybe George Washington
[26:59.720 --> 27:04.360]  doesn't exist I still go on shows and they go all the drones are gonna get us
[27:04.360 --> 27:10.080]  there's gonna be blimps and I'm like yeah I told you 15 years ago I told you
[27:10.080 --> 27:13.880]  that the executive branch is moving to just doing everything and Fiat just oh
[27:13.880 --> 27:16.720]  we just feel like it
[27:18.560 --> 27:23.320]  it's getting really really really crazy I mean look at this US and multinational
[27:23.320 --> 27:29.600]  military forces train in South Dakota's black Hills the Rapid City Journal
[27:29.600 --> 27:32.680]  reports its urban warfare training and I've been to countless of these drills
[27:32.680 --> 27:36.760]  who are foreign troops trained to take on the American people it's called Golden
[27:36.760 --> 27:44.160]  Coyote training and they're recreating the stress of combat
[27:46.520 --> 27:51.400]  and a mixture of civilian tourists and wildlife population soldiers encounter
[27:51.400 --> 27:55.200]  in war theaters such as Iraq and Afghanistan they always say that they
[27:55.200 --> 27:59.200]  actually read in LE09 and the other documents and well they now admit they
[27:59.200 --> 28:02.200]  say they'll use foreign troops to quote deal with American terrorists but then
[28:02.200 --> 28:06.280]  when it's announced the local paper it's oh we're just training to take on El
[28:06.280 --> 28:15.200]  Qaeda same folks they use to go into Syria and Libya pretty amazing oh but look
[28:15.200 --> 28:20.240]  right here oh they would never do this letting women enroll in Army Ranger
[28:20.240 --> 28:24.360]  School is a terrible idea and they're already saying they're gonna lower the
[28:24.360 --> 28:31.600]  standards you want to have to carry a 40 or 60 pound pack on a hump over 40
[28:31.600 --> 28:36.640]  miles you don't have to know no well you know women and again this is so they
[28:36.640 --> 28:39.880]  can make women slaves and draft them later won't matter soon it's all gonna
[28:39.880 --> 28:47.440]  be robots drones in the sky UGVs on the ground but here it is the total social
[28:47.440 --> 28:54.440]  engineering of everything retired balloon sergeant letting women enroll in Army
[28:54.440 --> 28:58.680]  Ranger School is a terrible idea no it's not not if you want to totally screw up
[28:58.680 --> 29:04.440]  the military ahead of making an all-go drone and all-go robot the system
[29:04.440 --> 29:09.480]  doesn't want manhood anymore that's why they put Miss Finault in the products by
[29:09.480 --> 29:13.320]  the way I remember four years ago they had the big melamine scare and they
[29:13.320 --> 29:17.720]  executed a bunch of Chinese factory heads and thousands of people died we had a
[29:17.720 --> 29:20.720]  bunch of deaths here but when your kid you know when your year old comes in and
[29:20.720 --> 29:25.360]  dies a kidney failure and and and liver failure they just you know sell an
[29:25.360 --> 29:33.360]  infection and that's in the news where they're now announcing that there is
[29:33.360 --> 29:39.960]  mercury in the products out of China the baby formula hey but so what I mean
[29:39.960 --> 29:46.640]  mercury that's AFP French news agency well that's okay I mean help mercury is
[29:46.640 --> 29:51.280]  good for you I'm not a conspiracy theorist we're on the march the

[33:39.000 --> 33:45.800]  important to be left to politicians they have neither the time the training nor
[33:45.800 --> 33:52.600]  the inclination for strategic thought. Resistance to tyrants is obedience to
[33:52.600 --> 34:08.560]  God it's Alex Jones by the way our main radio IT engineer one of his friends of
[34:08.560 --> 34:13.440]  quite a while called him on his cell phone during just the last break and I
[34:13.440 --> 34:18.080]  talked to him so we're going to bring him on right now we've got a whistleblower
[34:18.080 --> 34:24.560]  email it's whistleblowers at info wars.com whistleblowers at info wars.com
[34:24.560 --> 34:30.880]  about nuclear waste dumps biological whatever the case is in your area because
[34:30.880 --> 34:34.960]  they've built 36 of these in the last decade that have level four weapons in
[34:34.960 --> 34:39.400]  them in level two containment that's mainstream niche they're building or have
[34:39.400 --> 34:45.080]  built or in the process of another 200 we had a railgun cyclotron blow up four
[34:45.080 --> 34:49.320]  days ago was in the news three days ago that the department defense runs with
[34:49.320 --> 34:53.680]  DARPA at a UT facility outside Austin out by Bastrop because I know two
[34:53.680 --> 34:57.940]  different people that worked in it and I know somebody who remotely when he was
[34:57.940 --> 35:02.240]  here he's not another university even more advanced than UT there's only one
[35:02.240 --> 35:07.880]  other but who punched up and showed me the giant can facilities full of monkeys
[35:07.880 --> 35:14.040]  and apes like something out of a horror movie and that's going on people are
[35:14.040 --> 35:18.520]  worried about that because they do mess with Ebola airborne mouse pox monkey
[35:18.520 --> 35:26.720]  pox I mean stuff that some of the stuff so deadly it kills 97 to 98% of the
[35:26.720 --> 35:29.720]  mammals that comes in contact with it you know whatever you engineer it for
[35:29.720 --> 35:35.840]  rabbits mice humans pigs this is what we're dealing with and and it's just
[35:35.840 --> 35:39.880]  everywhere but we're told al-qaeda is so scary better chance of dying from a
[35:39.880 --> 35:43.800]  honeybee sting then we need to give up all of our rights I'm gonna get to part
[35:43.800 --> 35:48.360]  of this report that's up at info wars.com but I want to air it here for
[35:48.360 --> 35:51.800]  the radio audience you can see the video at info wars.com if you're a
[35:51.800 --> 35:55.880]  radio listener want to see the actual documents and Aaron Dyches up here till
[35:55.880 --> 36:00.200]  late last night he's coming in right now to add a bunch of links to the page
[36:00.200 --> 36:03.920]  that has the video because we're getting emails and calls saying there is no
[36:03.920 --> 36:08.280]  old reactor under UT even though I've got the Associated Press from the 1980s
[36:08.280 --> 36:12.560]  on it even though my dad went in there as a physics student and was able to you
[36:12.560 --> 36:17.000]  know see it and and and watch them experiments he wasn't high level so he
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.680]  was only able to watch some things even though UT admits they've got a little
[36:21.680 --> 36:25.800]  reactor and a big reactor in at the JJ Pickle Center people go there's no
[36:25.800 --> 36:30.120]  reactor in Austin because there hasn't been articles on it since the 80s they
[36:30.120 --> 36:35.960]  just say they do not exist they do not exist this is the incredible denial
[36:35.960 --> 36:39.600]  we'll just call this fellow Mac he's willing to use his whole name but he's
[36:39.600 --> 36:42.960]  just let's just say he's worked in the engineering and maintenance he's fired
[36:42.960 --> 36:47.400]  one of the rail guns Mac it's on record that this is going on we don't know
[36:47.400 --> 36:51.360]  about the dumping down on Redbud Trail even though I believe that you know his
[36:51.360 --> 36:54.680]  great-grandfather was being accurate he was the head of you know all the major
[36:54.680 --> 37:00.880]  facilities there are our source Chris Odom but Odin but but briefly before
[37:00.880 --> 37:05.480]  this report tell folks what you've witnessed working at the University of
[37:05.480 --> 37:11.360]  Texas with reactors rail guns other secret stuff yeah I was the I was the
[37:11.360 --> 37:16.000]  head maintenance guy for the University of Texas there and I had to go into
[37:16.000 --> 37:19.280]  these different buildings and do maintenance and stuff on them and one of
[37:19.280 --> 37:23.160]  the buildings I had to go on to and you can see it the building clearly right
[37:23.160 --> 37:26.000]  there breaker and burn it it's that building right there on the corner
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.400]  that's where the reactors at inside there you know so we'd have to go in there
[37:30.400 --> 37:33.800]  do maintenance and stuff and we'd have to wear pens just to see if we got
[37:33.800 --> 37:37.640]  contaminated and how much we were contaminated after we were in there
[37:37.640 --> 37:42.880]  working on it so it's there and that was in the mid 90s when I worked there so
[37:42.880 --> 37:48.360]  then the rail gun you can see that building clearly too from from a breaker
[37:48.360 --> 37:54.280]  lane or burn it I'm sorry burn it road that's that big blue metal building that
[37:54.280 --> 37:57.280]  sticks up there they get the rail gun in there that shoot down into a hole with
[37:57.280 --> 38:02.040]  well they've got another one outside Austin in fact where was that on the map
[38:02.040 --> 38:05.760]  guys the exact location of that facility but I mean it was in KXAN that blew up
[38:05.760 --> 38:12.040]  four days ago yeah that's out in Leander and that that hit a car it looks
[38:12.040 --> 38:16.360]  like close to a half a mile away and blew part of the building up I mean my
[38:16.360 --> 38:22.320]  point is we're just sitting on top of giant complex of tunnels and things yeah
[38:22.320 --> 38:25.800]  and then there's all kinds of research going on there just you know different
[38:25.800 --> 38:29.800]  time but you know at the time it was pretty neat I got to see you know with
[38:29.800 --> 38:33.880]  my own eyes what goes on inside that thing and and get to see the reef you
[38:33.880 --> 38:38.200]  know the rail gun fire off got to see the hand model that they were working on
[38:38.200 --> 38:42.560]  you know just at that point it was you know a whole room full of batteries just
[38:42.560 --> 38:46.560]  make thing work by the way sir that's did they tell you that was classified that
[38:46.560 --> 38:51.640]  Department of Defense hand-held rail gun no by the way that's highly classified
[38:51.640 --> 38:55.360]  in fact it looks just like the one I was told by the military that you see
[38:55.360 --> 39:01.640]  Schwarzenegger in a racer yeah that's they've got wow so so you've actually
[39:01.640 --> 39:07.400]  seen they've actually showed you the hand-held rail gun model it didn't
[39:07.400 --> 39:10.360]  quite look like the one that Arnold Schwarzenegger had one they have you know
[39:10.360 --> 39:14.680]  of course there's a prototype so like I said it it has to have a whole room of
[39:14.680 --> 39:18.560]  batteries and stuff to work on but you know how technology goes over the years
[39:18.560 --> 39:22.800]  they know how to reduce the the battery size and get more power out of it
[39:22.800 --> 39:27.280]  incredible anything else you saw while doing maintenance for the University of
[39:27.280 --> 39:32.200]  Texas at Austin no I've seen a bunch of stuff that you know where they talk
[39:32.200 --> 39:37.160]  about million-year-old bones and stuff so but you know I don't believe any
[39:37.160 --> 39:40.480]  things a million years old and God created everything and that's the way I
[39:40.480 --> 39:45.640]  believe it so well they also create a fake debate between science to make
[39:45.640 --> 39:49.640]  Christians look dumb so so then the preachers say one thing which really
[39:49.640 --> 39:53.160]  isn't really in the Bible and then it could you know be I mean becomes a huge
[39:53.160 --> 39:56.240]  debate that's why all these globalists are coming out and genetic
[39:56.240 --> 39:59.640]  engineers are coming out and actually becoming religious because now they've
[39:59.640 --> 40:03.920]  looked at it and they say there's no way the majority of them now and that's what
[40:03.920 --> 40:07.760]  Prometheus is all about they're saying okay something made us but it must be
[40:07.760 --> 40:12.800]  Martians you know it must be folks from Clan Dathu because it certainly you
[40:12.800 --> 40:16.800]  know wasn't the guy in the sky you know those people are wrong but but yeah
[40:16.800 --> 40:21.840]  Martians made us because you look at the DNA you look at all of it and it's
[40:21.840 --> 40:26.560]  totally freaking the scientists out it's clearly been designed yeah and I was
[40:26.560 --> 40:29.800]  there when they were born to joke on a new student that was coming to do some
[40:29.800 --> 40:35.120]  research on testing the bones and see how many people how many million years
[40:35.120 --> 40:41.960]  after it was and unfortunately sir your cell phones breaking up can you hear me
[40:41.960 --> 40:49.240]  now Mac we lost him you know if he's willing to come in studio someday we
[40:49.240 --> 40:52.520]  ought to get him in here with us okay thank you Mac we'll have to get him back
[40:52.520 --> 40:55.160]  on and I don't think that was a conspiracy probably just how bad cell
[40:55.160 --> 40:59.680]  phones are nowadays of course those radiate your brain as well let's go
[40:59.680 --> 41:03.960]  ahead and go to part of this news piece the whole things up on info wars.com
[41:03.960 --> 41:08.800]  and again it's not just Austin Texas the Soviets would just throw old reactors
[41:08.800 --> 41:13.200]  in the ocean I mean it's it's effectors a couple nukes from US aircraft that
[41:13.200 --> 41:17.600]  crashed in the Atlantic that there's one right off Georgia and they just leave
[41:17.600 --> 41:21.480]  it there they always fine it's just no big deal yeah the cancer rates are
[41:21.480 --> 41:25.600]  exploding but every radiation is good for you and culture said the Japanese
[41:25.600 --> 41:32.160]  ought to be thankful for Fukushima it's good for him yeah absolutely just ask
[41:32.160 --> 41:37.040]  the million people that died in the two decades after Chernobyl here's part of
[41:37.040 --> 41:41.800]  the report breaking massive nuclear secrets uncovered in Austin Texas here
[41:41.800 --> 41:47.040]  it is. We have been compelled to create a permanent
[41:47.040 --> 41:52.160]  armaments industry of vast proportions we must guard against the
[41:52.160 --> 41:56.840]  acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the
[41:56.840 --> 42:02.120]  military industrial complex. From before the days of President Dwight D. Eisenhower
[42:02.120 --> 42:06.760]  the military industrial complex has dominated research at universities
[42:06.760 --> 42:12.240]  across the United States. We must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger
[42:12.240 --> 42:19.720]  that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological
[42:19.720 --> 42:26.320]  elite in laboratories and testing fields. The free university has
[42:26.320 --> 42:30.520]  experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. There have been many
[42:30.520 --> 42:37.360]  disasters in California in 1959 a large sodium reactor melted down and many
[42:37.360 --> 42:41.520]  estimates show that it was over 70 times bigger than Three Mile Island and
[42:41.520 --> 42:46.160]  similar in effect to Chernobyl but Americans weren't told about it for
[42:46.160 --> 42:57.040]  decades later. That's why it's important to look at all the secret and covert
[42:57.040 --> 43:02.400]  infrastructure across the United States including Austin Texas the site of three
[43:02.400 --> 43:08.600]  different covert nuclear reactors and reports of huge caches of radioactive
[43:08.600 --> 43:13.960]  waste being hidden in the community of Austin Texas. This is similar to large
[43:13.960 --> 43:18.200]  stockpiles that have been found in California and other states no one
[43:18.200 --> 43:22.480]  wants the waste in their community so government universities tend to hide it.
[43:22.480 --> 43:29.560]  Alex Jones here with a breaking first report on the underground infrastructure
[43:29.560 --> 43:35.440]  that literally infest Austin Texas and surrounding areas. Bio weapons, rail guns,
[43:35.440 --> 43:42.320]  secret cyclotron facilities exploding just a few days ago and big underground
[43:42.320 --> 43:48.240]  nuclear plants research facilities some of the biggest research facilities in
[43:48.240 --> 43:53.280]  the country right here in Austin and almost no newspaper articles about it
[43:53.280 --> 43:56.720]  the articles we found online by the statesmen others have been removed
[43:56.720 --> 44:01.520]  Wikipedia has had the record of it is sponge but my father when he was going
[44:01.520 --> 44:06.480]  to the University of Texas in the late 60s and was in departments that had
[44:06.480 --> 44:12.480]  access to the downtown reactor saw it himself worked on it as part of his
[44:12.480 --> 44:18.280]  physics class then in the late 80s they built new larger reactors in north
[44:18.280 --> 44:21.880]  Austin we're going to show you both of those but in our investigation of these
[44:21.880 --> 44:26.360]  secretive infrastructures the Department of Defense is controlling right here in
[44:26.360 --> 44:30.120]  Austin but also in many other cities around the country we discovered that
[44:30.120 --> 44:35.160]  hiding right under our nose our own Chris Odin's great-grandfather had been the
[44:35.160 --> 44:39.160]  head superintendent of all the facilities for the University of Texas in
[44:39.160 --> 44:45.400]  Austin the biggest campus in the world and that up until 1970 when he retired he
[44:45.400 --> 44:50.200]  told his great-grandson and family for that matter that the huge underground
[44:50.200 --> 44:56.760]  cave system right outside Austin had been used as a secret dumping ground so
[44:56.760 --> 45:03.040]  Chris here in our office tell folks exactly what your grandfather told you
[45:03.040 --> 45:08.840]  that they stored in there and how big this cave system is my great-grandfather
[45:08.840 --> 45:15.040]  Benny Ellis had told me many times about a site on the western portion of
[45:15.040 --> 45:21.120]  Austin what used to be the outside of the city limits right off of Redbud
[45:21.120 --> 45:28.280]  Trail I'd say just a couple of hundred yards south of where the dam is at the
[45:28.280 --> 45:32.320]  beginning of the Old Town Lake Lady Bird Lake whatever they call it and he told
[45:32.320 --> 45:38.560]  me for for many years they had dumped barrels of chemical waste heavy chest
[45:38.560 --> 45:43.960]  and containers of metal waste that he knew to be radioactive he described them
[45:43.960 --> 45:51.280]  as containers with biohazard labels radioactive labels he had had the
[45:51.280 --> 45:56.240]  responsibility of controlling transportation and so in many cases he
[45:56.240 --> 46:00.040]  was witness to such events and you said that your great-grandfather said that
[46:00.040 --> 46:03.600]  they would wall it off and that and that there were areas that were cemented so
[46:03.600 --> 46:08.200]  they would put it back in crevices over the years even when looking at the the
[46:08.200 --> 46:13.000]  cave entrance site there are players that are comprised of older concrete you
[46:13.000 --> 46:17.760]  can see it's pitted and has aged and then there have been newer installations
[46:17.760 --> 46:22.120]  where it's more polished updated concrete they've even disguised or what I
[46:22.120 --> 46:25.720]  consider disguised a portion of it as drainage for the entrance that goes
[46:25.720 --> 46:29.080]  underneath the cliff that's near it this is a big deal because we have this
[46:29.080 --> 46:33.400]  history not just here but in Russia Japan where they just store this stuff all
[46:33.400 --> 46:37.800]  over the place they store it in warehouses illegally repeat what you told me on
[46:37.800 --> 46:42.240]  the radio earlier today about the fact that they started moving it up to Red
[46:42.240 --> 46:47.840]  Bud because it had been an East Austin yes according to him for many years they
[46:47.840 --> 46:53.920]  had been attempting to store waste of many kinds dumping waste of many kinds as
[46:53.920 --> 47:00.040]  well as simply storing heavy equipment used by the University out where what
[47:00.040 --> 47:04.880]  is today dish fog field it's a large baseball diamond that part of Austin
[47:04.880 --> 47:09.440]  was East Austin typically known for having a higher minority population
[47:09.440 --> 47:14.680]  there was a lot of blowback from the community and they in turn began to
[47:14.680 --> 47:19.840]  store it underground in those lesser known facilities hey this is stored in
[47:19.840 --> 47:24.640]  the richest part of Austin now it was not at that time it was city limits there
[47:24.640 --> 47:30.400]  were there was very little development it was it was country it was at that time
[47:30.400 --> 47:33.720]  now I've got friends that live out there and there's old fishing shacks and
[47:33.720 --> 47:37.320]  things from the 30s and 40s and that's all that was out there right when that
[47:37.320 --> 47:41.520]  was the countryside exactly now before we get into the full report that's just
[47:41.520 --> 47:45.120]  part one because this just started developing yesterday what's your overall
[47:45.120 --> 47:49.320]  view and did your great-grandfather who was the head of superintendent of
[47:49.320 --> 47:52.960]  facilities at UT for all those years they were talking about the reactor
[47:52.960 --> 48:01.200]  underneath the presidential library he did describe what many had said was
[48:01.200 --> 48:08.400]  underneath the Robert Lee Memorial building he said that there was more
[48:08.400 --> 48:14.480]  activity going on under the ground than above the ground the campus was
[48:14.480 --> 48:23.080]  enormous and the tunnels were fast they were able to do things like transfer
[48:23.080 --> 48:28.640]  library books from one building to another underground when weather wouldn't
[48:28.640 --> 48:35.200]  permit he even described times when personnel would use underground
[48:35.200 --> 48:39.680]  corridors instead of traveling above ground it's not just Austin Texas there
[48:39.680 --> 48:44.160]  is secret infrastructure in every major city but even my grandfather and family
[48:44.160 --> 48:47.280]  that lived here in Austin talked about the old sack base that's now our
[48:47.280 --> 48:51.440]  international airport Bergstrom and they admit that the Hilton Hotel out there
[48:51.440 --> 48:56.120]  is the big sack command building was that and I've talked to family who's
[48:56.120 --> 48:59.360]  currently in the military who says well we can't talk about it but yes there's a
[48:59.360 --> 49:03.400]  big underground base there there's railways connected to UT the capital and
[49:03.400 --> 49:08.520]  all the way out to Fort Hood 60 miles away I mean it's amazing the United
[49:08.520 --> 49:12.120]  States has spent more money than all their countries combined on defense but
[49:12.120 --> 49:18.160]  also on COG continuity of government can you imagine how big these underground
[49:18.160 --> 49:23.160]  bases are I mean if I've been told it's just staggering the whole giant secret
[49:23.160 --> 49:27.840]  government corporate infrastructure that's underground despite the bedrock
[49:27.840 --> 49:32.400]  here despite the manpower that would go into such a thing I know I've been told
[49:32.400 --> 49:37.160]  of underground bases even located the capital that were installed during the
[49:37.160 --> 49:42.080]  Cold War simply for bomb shelters so thank you for taking time out to talk
[49:42.080 --> 49:45.560]  with us today we're gonna get into the full report right now from you guys on
[49:45.560 --> 49:50.760]  the street yesterday Aaron Dykes yourself and Rob Jacobson running camera
[49:50.760 --> 49:56.120]  we're gonna have a part two next week this rabbit hole goes very very deep the
[49:56.120 --> 49:59.680]  fact that most Austinites don't even know that bio weapons are being developed
[49:59.680 --> 50:03.280]  in Austin that if they got out would kill over 90% of the people things like
[50:03.280 --> 50:07.760]  mouse drives things like airborne all right the the actual full report once
[50:07.760 --> 50:11.800]  throughout in the field is up at info wars calm and I noticed posted in that
[50:11.800 --> 50:17.520]  article breaking massive nuclear secret uncovered in Austin Texas a commenter
[50:17.520 --> 50:26.600]  named Wells says hey history it's no secret and it has a University of Texas
[50:26.600 --> 50:31.520]  link explaining they were the first university to have a reactor on it and to
[50:31.520 --> 50:37.320]  teach nuclear engineering yeah we know that people are denying it saying it's
[50:37.320 --> 50:42.440]  not true but let me give you a little newsflash Wells I've been saying that
[50:42.440 --> 50:48.400]  over and over again it's in the news but rarely and we've got a witness whose
[50:48.400 --> 50:52.680]  great-grandfather was the head of the entire operations at that time about
[50:52.680 --> 50:58.200]  them hiding nuclear waste okay that's the news let me say it again hiding
[50:58.200 --> 51:03.040]  nuclear waste okay for a long time you've heard me talk about building your

[54:10.280 --> 54:17.520]  if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv all you got to do is look at the screen
[54:17.520 --> 54:22.080]  and there is University of Texas at Austin Cockrell School of Engineering
[54:22.080 --> 54:26.160]  nuclear and radiation engineering program providing education research
[54:26.160 --> 54:31.000]  problem-solving and service in nuclear science and engineering I can't even get
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.520]  people to admit there's nuclear reactors under the main campus and in
[54:34.520 --> 54:38.120]  north Austin they don't just have one big one they've got a little a little one
[54:38.120 --> 54:43.160]  I've been told as well up there at the JJ Pickle thing and spin rail guns and
[54:43.160 --> 54:48.280]  everything else you can imagine one blew up earlier in the week and it's got the
[54:48.280 --> 54:54.040]  history admitting they were the first in the country at a university 1957 they
[54:54.040 --> 54:57.200]  admit radiation effects on materials is what they study and then I guess they
[54:57.200 --> 55:00.960]  dump them in caves you believe our sources stewardship of existing nuclear
[55:00.960 --> 55:05.200]  weapons oh they have a stewardship of that managing existing radioactive waste
[55:05.200 --> 55:08.720]  oh they really manage it well let me tell you production methods of radio
[55:08.720 --> 55:15.720]  isotopes neutron activation analysis and prompt gamma activation analysis
[55:15.720 --> 55:20.760]  environmental chemistry nuclear electrical power health and physics
[55:20.760 --> 55:26.880]  applications neutron imaging non-proliferation computational nuclear
[55:26.880 --> 55:32.880]  engineering and it just goes on with all of it and there's videos of the big
[55:32.880 --> 55:37.720]  reactor and glowing blue and all the rest of you can watch Aaron's adding
[55:37.720 --> 55:42.280]  links to all this under the video that's red linked at info wars calm for
[55:42.280 --> 55:46.240]  people living an absolute and total denial my point is they got these in
[55:46.240 --> 55:51.000]  cities all over nobody knows about they've got bio weapons labs just right
[55:51.000 --> 55:59.920]  here outside Austin I have seen it and they said a rail gun blow up last week
[55:59.920 --> 56:03.960]  and I found an associated press article where they were admitting well it's in
[56:03.960 --> 56:08.800]  the larger video report where they say oh 70% chance one of our level four
[56:08.800 --> 56:17.440]  bio weapon things will get out and these are weaponized super viruses and
[56:17.440 --> 56:24.040]  bacteria my point is government and the universities and these people that are a
[56:24.040 --> 56:27.760]  bunch of mad scientists are the threat I'm not afraid of science but it's the
[56:27.760 --> 56:36.120]  way they do it what's the number 90 right at 90% of reactors we break that
[56:36.120 --> 56:39.400]  down the report show mainstream news articles are leaking worldwide not just
[56:39.400 --> 56:43.840]  here they just don't care the radiation eats through the metal folks they just
[56:43.840 --> 56:48.160]  don't care I'll let it leak we've decided it's good oh yeah the engineering
[56:48.160 --> 56:53.880]  staff are all getting cancer so what it's only life there's a craziness until
[56:53.880 --> 56:58.560]  1990 they wouldn't let the troops use DU then they said oh use it it's fine it
[56:58.560 --> 57:05.240]  it is a delusional magical thinking what's happening the GMO all of it we
[57:05.240 --> 57:10.000]  are in so much trouble ladies and gentlemen we've got to get a handle on
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.400]  this and I can't even get people to admit that there's underground tunnels I
[57:14.400 --> 57:17.600]  get emails saying oh they're not that big of tunnels there's no there's no
[57:17.600 --> 57:22.720]  nukes under there there's no I'm like hey we have the former head of the entire
[57:22.720 --> 57:29.000]  you know UT system for maintenance saying that they hid stuff in the 60s up
[57:29.000 --> 57:33.400]  in the 70s in this state-owned cave right by this big state building
[57:33.400 --> 57:37.000]  facility which is what feds in the states have been caught doing over and
[57:37.000 --> 57:41.040]  over again other is we look into it and I'll guarantee you that if anybody calls
[57:41.040 --> 57:44.080]  environmental groups the police or whatever they'll just say there ain't no
[57:44.080 --> 57:51.040]  reactor that they wouldn't get to that point there ain't no reactor and it's
[57:51.040 --> 58:03.520]  good for you they wouldn't have the trip use it if it won't get more and good look
[58:03.520 --> 58:07.240]  at this article I meant to get to this yesterday the weekly standard state
[58:07.240 --> 58:10.520]  department video visit America it's easier than you think yeah they're
[58:10.520 --> 58:15.600]  losing $40 billion a year last number I saw CNN reported a people won't come
[58:15.600 --> 58:21.080]  here because no one's ever had their genitals grabbed anywhere no one's ever
[58:21.080 --> 58:24.520]  been screamed at and then biometrically scanned but the illegal aliens are all
[58:24.520 --> 58:27.960]  legalized but you want to come here from England you want to come here from
[58:27.960 --> 58:31.560]  South Africa you want to come here you know as a doctor from China whatever
[58:31.560 --> 58:35.920]  listen you're gonna get groped your family's gonna get abused people are
[58:35.920 --> 58:45.440]  like wow I'm not getting near that country this is GCN the Genesis
[58:45.440 --> 58:53.000]  communications radio network hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global
[58:53.000 --> 58:56.560]  elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the
[58:56.560 --> 59:00.320]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could
[59:00.320 --> 59:04.040]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even
[59:04.040 --> 59:07.280]  golden silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[59:07.280 --> 59:11.400]  again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect
[59:11.400 --> 59:16.800]  mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an
[59:16.800 --> 59:20.840]  endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the
[59:20.840 --> 59:24.800]  best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you
[59:24.800 --> 59:28.920]  actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them
[59:28.920 --> 59:34.120]  today at survivalseedbank.com that's survivalseedbank.com or give them a
[59:34.120 --> 59:44.280]  call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis
[59:44.280 --> 59:48.400]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for
[59:48.400 --> 59:51.600]  survivalseedbank.com
[59:51.600 --> 01:00:00.440]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:12.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:19.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.280]  Alex Jones
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:31.720]  all right we only had him on for about 20 minutes last week I want to get him on
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:36.400]  for about 40 minutes or so coming up in the next segment Lord Moncton Lord
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:40.080]  Christopher Moncton the leading expert fighting the globalist when it comes to
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:44.800]  their fake environmental takeover we're gonna be speaking to him because he's
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:52.360]  getting ready to go down to the big agenda 21 20 years after event in South
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:56.120]  America the same place that Maury Strong said we're gonna shut down the
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.560]  West we're gonna shut down the industrial base to fully control people
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:05.200]  humans are bad so but but but but radiation and GMO overfishing are fine
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:10.040]  just tax people for carbon dioxide so that's coming up and we're gonna open
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.760]  the phones up in fact we'll I'll give you the number now because we'll talk
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:16.440]  about 20 minutes then we'll take calls for Lord Moncton if you'd like to speak
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:26.080]  to him coming up specifically to our guest 800-25-99231 800-25-99231 and
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.440]  again we don't screen your calls but then you know a couple times a week I
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:34.520]  say hey I have a guest on it's about this subject agenda 21 New World Order fake
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:39.240]  environmental movement that's a pretty big area and people in inevitably call
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.960]  in and and and bring up something else that's not happening when we take the
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:48.560]  calls for our guest okay I mean it's a very wide area but that's what he's on
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:58.000]  about the big conference coming up 800-25-99231 800-25-99231 now if you go
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.440]  up to info wars.com we have got a lot of really important stories up there
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:08.520]  today one of the biggest is that Obama plans an attack on the first amendment
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:13.200]  if reelected also the Associated Press is reporting but we already told you was
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.600]  already going on behind the scenes they're just legalizing the illegals
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.640]  they just they just give them even if they're felons they just give them a
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:24.800]  green guard and then give them welfare and they're they're not deporting people
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:29.840]  hardly at all anymore and they got border patrol all the way up to San Antonio 200
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:33.720]  miles in pulling citizens over and searching your vehicle for firearms and
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:39.040]  things I mean it is just lawlessness a total criminal lawlessness by the state
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:44.880]  by the time that Obama's secret weapon of legalizing weed that is in the
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:51.560]  Atlantic wire under the pro Obama camp and there's also an Associated Press
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:55.800]  article it's actually the Associated Press posted at the Atlantic and they
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:01.920]  say is legalizing weed Obama's secret weapon he told all of the weed heads he
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:09.240]  told them all that four years ago and you say marijuana doesn't stunt your
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:12.560]  memory or whatever okay then fine you remember he said he was gonna do that
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:17.320]  last time he went and voted for him like suckers and then he came in and
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:21.320]  through the book at legal dispensaries and medical marijuana doctors and now
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:27.280]  they've got the feds AP again reports today going after the people that rent
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:32.560]  legal marijuana dispensaries in California other areas their asset
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:39.320]  forfeiture seizing just taking their property again I am for decriminalization
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:42.800]  of drugs because when they're illegal it just makes the price go up and that
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.320]  allows the big banks water the money but it doesn't mean I have to be in love
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:48.360]  with it I know some people that can smoke marijuana very successfully and
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:52.120]  others that are like zombies there's a lot of people who you know don't have
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.600]  any motivation and just want to watch Oprah Winfrey all day and smoke pot I
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.640]  think marijuana is not as halfway as bad as alcohol and I get I never been a
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:03.400]  really a fan of the way marijuana makes me feel I don't want to go over the big
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:08.840]  side issue but you demystify it by decriminalizing it now hemp and most
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:13.160]  varieties have no THC in it so it doesn't get you quote high I call it get
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:20.680]  you low in most cases but the point is it is better for rope better than cotton
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:25.040]  better than polyester that's why DuPont and others in the 30s they lobby to make
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:31.760]  it illegal and enlisted as a narcotic as terribly calls it a friend with weed is
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:38.640]  a friend indeed me gold me gold when he attacks Ron Paul so hilarious but people
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.880]  thought I was joking when I said he does that I got him doing on the show last
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:46.360]  week or was it Monday it was Monday all right we're gonna go break and go to Lord
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:51.240]  Christopher Monks on the other side of science and public policy dot org I'm
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:57.480]  Alex Jones of prison planet dot TV and info wars dot com and don't blink cuz
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:03.000]  your life will be over time is flying you've heard Alex explain how the
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.800]  silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:10.760]  colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:13.800]  silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:18.960]  solutions anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the

[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:45.000]  tyranny is Lord Christopher Moncton and he's gonna be joining us here in just a
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:51.560]  moment he's getting ready to go to the Rio plus 20 we're talking about several
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:57.240]  decades after the big meeting that set in stone agenda 21 morey strong the
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:02.200]  world government what size toilet you can have worldwide set by the UN what
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:07.480]  your carbon footprint can selectively be what type of light bulbs you can have
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:10.480]  and it lists everything that's not dangerous like carbon dioxide is bad
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:15.560]  ignores the overfishing GMO all the other serious issues that should be looked
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:19.000]  at and I'm gonna be saying all GMO would be bad but it's the back doors these
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.760]  eugenicists are putting into them we've proven so they're gonna be meeting
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:26.960]  they're going away from okay carbon dioxide's bad we're all gonna flood and
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:35.000]  die day after tomorrow to okay any change is abnormal and we need to if

[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:48.600]  land's swimming animal you've got to pay global government money and they want
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:54.160]  their agenda 21 of the seas law the sea treaty which Obama says under
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:59.440]  executive order he's now implementing period all of our rivers major waterways
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:11.120]  that are not contiguous to the oceans 76% of the world's covering is salt and
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:16.760]  then 1% fresh water and they are saying they own it all doesn't matter of
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:21.000]  Congress doesn't sign on to this Obama has announced associated press that
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.440]  they're gonna give you mean immunity to any illegal aliens they want no judge
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:30.040]  no jury no Congress no laws they shut down power plants that aren't owned by
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:34.760]  General Electric and other insiders to make their stock and profits go up they
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:38.000]  give thousands of waivers to big companies that give him money and give
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.760]  the Democrats money from socialist healthcare globalist healthcare I mean
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:47.720]  this is total mafia government and Lord Monk is preparing he joins us to be a
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:53.480]  video Skype from London to travel to Rio the scene of the crime several decades
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:57.280]  ago where they are attempting to re-coordinate their takeover and as he
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:00.760]  said many times we're exposing them we're defeating them as frauds on that
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:04.680]  level but they still have the government and the bureaucracy in the media
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:08.840]  they're just moving forward but Lord Monkton what do you call this form of
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.280]  government where it's not even really socialist you can call it fascist I
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:19.000]  mean it's just piratical criminal selectively enforced absolute evil I
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:25.240]  mean what do you call this system a post industrial nihilistic fruit kingdom
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:28.760]  that they're setting up what would you call it Lord Christopher Monkton well
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:33.400]  you've given quite a few good names there but it's really predatory totalitarianism
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:39.160]  these are people who would have fitted in very well with the fascist regimes or
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:44.640]  communist regimes of old they are the control freaks who want to run as you
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:49.080]  rightly said every detail of our lives down to the last light bulb or bit of
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:55.000]  toilet paper and they are all gathering in very large numbers in Rio de Janeiro
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.140]  this week and they will be talking to one another and of course to the
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:06.320]  forming media of the world who have fallen for this at every stage but
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:12.200]  there's one very very significant change which I can report already that's come
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:16.640]  out of this conference and that is that they have now officially abandoned
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:23.040]  climate change as being the worst problem that faces humanity they have now
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:28.480]  reasserted what was always the case before which is that poverty is the
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:34.280]  worst problem facing humanity and this is a very welcome sign that slowly but
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:38.880]  surely reality is beginning to break break back in even to these pointy
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:45.640]  heads very well said so what is the state of their operations I mean they're
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:50.480]  going ahead with banning Coca-Cola's and popcorn and milk in New York there
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.800]  they're going ahead with green police harassing farmers saying you can have
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:59.560]  dust on your farm I mean I mean I know that they're in trouble with the
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:05.040]  public in polls but as you warned years ago when when Copenhagen first broke
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:09.000]  they don't care they're just going forward well they'll count of course
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:15.160]  totalitarianism is very old it goes back even to early imperial China 500 years
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:20.400]  BC the Chinese were talking of what they called the legalist outlook and most
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:24.040]  governments tend to be to some degree legalist in other words they want to
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:27.640]  control things they want to control you and that if they want to control
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:33.120]  absolutely every aspect of your life then that's what we now call totalitarianism
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:37.400]  and the Chinese would call it and still do call it legalism whereas you and I
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:41.800]  Alex are confusions that's the other side of the Chinese coin going back to
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:48.920]  500 years BC and Confucianism is the more enlightened open democratic libertarian
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:54.120]  free market come one come all approach which says we don't know best it's the
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:57.360]  people that know best what's best for the people it's not for the governing class
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:01.880]  to say that it knows best and then to impose savage regimes of excessive
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:07.320]  taxation and regulation to back up whatever the current taboos and
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:11.840]  chivalrous and fashions are at the moment it's the environment because the
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.960]  left captured the environmental movement some years ago my good friend the late
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:19.320]  Eric Ellington was one of the founders of Greenpeace he said he and many other
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.880]  founders had to leave after a year or two because they weren't political and
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:27.760]  they didn't therefore know how to stop the entries and by the Marxists who all
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.440]  piled across the Berlin Wall and straight into our environmental movement
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:35.320]  and among other things took over Greenpeace so all the Marxists all the
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:40.720]  totalitarians all the fascists will all be in one place and if someone were to
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.960]  drop a large bomb on it you'd lose me but you'd lose most of the pointy heads
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:48.120]  in the world at the same time very large numbers of them have gone there
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:53.280]  they're holding a series of events and side events of the most improbable kind
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:58.680]  but all of them involve botting us around imposing enormous taxes and above
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:03.920]  all this is their real aim shutting down the West
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:08.880]  how do we defeat them why are you why is it important I mean obviously it's
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:13.200]  important but why you know for new listeners why is it important to go to
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:18.080]  Rio and cover what they're going to be doing let's give a couple of examples
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:23.760]  before Copenhagen the climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009 that's
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:27.760]  getting on three years ago when they were going to try to impose again a
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:31.080]  world government treaty they actually wrote a draft world government treaty
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:36.480]  the word government appears in that treaty in two places in that context
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:41.120]  for the first time ever seen any treaty now I exposed that treaty I got hold of
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:45.440]  a copy in advance often obscure UN website where they had hoped nobody
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:48.880]  would see it but they would later be able to say oh it's been posted up there
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:52.720]  all the time when people got caught by surprise anyway I got it out and
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:57.640]  publicized it and within a week the speech in which I publicized it had gone
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:01.160]  platinum on YouTube it's the fastest YouTube platinum for any political
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:05.360]  speech likewise when I went to the Durban climate conference just last
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:10.880]  December and revealed among other things that they were going to give legal
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:15.920]  rights to sue to mother earth I could you not mother earth they were going to
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:21.040]  reduce carbon dioxide concentration to half of what it is today which would
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:26.360]  cause mass extinctions of plants animals and probably humans too and they were
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:30.600]  also going to set up an international climate court to which people like you
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:35.400]  and me could be dragged for daring to raise perfectly proper scientific and
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:40.080]  economic questions about what the hard left have been proposing and when I
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:45.200]  revealed the contents of that treaty once again that went viral all over the
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:51.200]  internet and within a couple of days wordpress that published 500,000 blog
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:57.000]  postings every day told us that this blog posting by me just telling people all
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:03.240]  the nonsensical things that were in this draft Durban agreement had reached
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:08.800]  more people than any other one of the 500,000 blog postings that they had put
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:12.680]  out that day to put out 500 blog thousand blog postings on all subject
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:17.920]  every day mine was number one because people want to know what is being done
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:22.680]  in their name at these international conferences and the left-wing media are
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:26.800]  inconspicuous left-wing bureaucrats and governments and the UN to make
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:31.040]  absolutely sure that they don't get told now if you're new to this and you
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:36.040]  think what is he saying about a conspiracy the fact is that unless I
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:41.200]  had been there to reveal the contents of that document the main negotiating
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:45.280]  document of the Durban climate conference nobody else and I mean nobody
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:49.880]  else worldwide would have bothered to tell their readers or viewers or listeners
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:55.000]  what was in that that is an astounding point Lord Monkton and you've done this
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:03.040]  every year at these big events you and folks that go with you are able to get
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:07.400]  information out and then it goes viral that no one would have reported on
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:12.800]  because the lapdog media worldwide just goes along with whatever they're told
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:19.840]  by Ban Ki-moon they never ask a proper question and it's uncanny this this
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:27.040]  sullen refusal simply to report what is actually happening one doesn't mind that
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.720]  they all have a Marxist viewpoint if that's what they want they can have it
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:36.080]  you can see the consequences of Marxism now in Europe that kind of socialism
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:42.080]  heavy state spending heavy taxation has now become so out of control that it is
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:46.600]  visibly failing so if they want to subscribe to that in a few years time
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:49.720]  everybody will be laughing at them and saying well there you are that was the
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:54.440]  crisis of Marxism nobody now wants to go that way but at the moment they're
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:59.160]  still at it they'll all be in Rio they won't have any realizations that the
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:03.840]  gravy train has finally tipped into the gulch and they can't go on robbing the
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:07.880]  taxpayers blind because the taxpayers have run out of money they can't go on
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:10.560]  borrowing because the more they borrow them while they put themselves in hot
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:15.920]  to China they can't go on doing that so all this nonsense is soon going to have
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:21.200]  to stop I regard it as very significant that they have now abandoned the notion
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:26.160]  that the supposed threat to the climate is the most serious problem humanity now
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:32.320]  faces in the opening sentences of the current draft of the conclusions of the
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:37.360]  Rio conference that has now been taken out and replaced as I've said earlier by

[01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:00.760]  Monkton of science and public policy dot org former top advisor to Margaret
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:06.960]  Thatcher award-winning journalist I won't go over all his bio is lengthy and he is
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:10.720]  joining us from London right now okay this is a short segment and we're gonna
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:13.760]  come back and get into other points you think are important to take calls but
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:19.120]  we're not overstating it I know you break down these numbers of what Copenhagen
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:22.480]  three years ago would have done to the third world if implemented and they
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:27.520]  tried to sell that is come on you've got to love the black people especially and
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:32.560]  the poor Asians and Latin Americans let us put this in place but then the draft
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:37.560]  got leaked they confirmed it was the draft you helped do that and it was
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:42.040]  right at double the cuts in the third world that would even be on the West so
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:45.880]  they tried to sell it to them as we'll cut off the energy to the West and give
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:49.440]  it to you but they found out it was really a death sentence and you look at
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:54.160]  all these quote environmentalist to a man they put out papers about too many
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:59.000]  people and get rid of the third world really hardcore racist going back to
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.160]  Margaret Sanger all of them and I know you've studied this Lord Monkton pose as
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:07.800]  liberals they're not even really liberals that's their cover a real killer
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:12.920]  poses as a non-threatening trendy chicken neck can you can you break down
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:17.080]  who these people are from fighting them for 30 plus years and and correct me if
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:21.680]  I'm wrong that their plan is a death sentence to over a billion people in
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:26.080]  the third world when they shell us on its it's for the poor give us world
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:30.560]  government pay the UN trillions for the poor give us the environmental
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:34.440]  straightjacket for the poor tell us what's really happening well here's the
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:40.640]  thing if a nation wants to give money to the poor of other nations it can do so
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:47.720]  directly it doesn't need the UN for that but the UN has realized it's
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:52.920]  increasingly hard to justify its existence and so it has captured various
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:57.040]  international subjects such as poverty and they tried on the climate change
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:02.400]  thing the agenda 21 thing to make themselves seem relevant and to allow
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:07.040]  themselves to continue to attract more money from governments privately many
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:11.720]  of us here in Britain are thinking that even though Britain has one of the five
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:16.600]  permanent seats on the governing security council of the United Nations we
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:20.800]  would actually be better off giving up that seat as long as we could leave the
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:25.680]  United Nations altogether and not either have to pay the billions every year it
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:32.520]  costs to belong or to be governed by the increasingly intrusive regulations and
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:38.040]  powers that this organization is trying to arrogate to itself the people
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:44.480]  behind it essentially are the governing class worldwide of which I am a member
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:49.640]  but I'm one of those rather like Margaret Thatcher who doesn't think that
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:55.640]  it's our job to tell everybody around the world what to do still less to
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:28:00.680]  extinguish poor people in the third world extinguishing poverty ought not to
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:04.800]  mean extinguishing the poor it ought to mean making the poor better off
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:09.280]  because it's only if they become more wealthy and more prosperous and at
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:13.840]  least have a basic standard of living that's acceptable clean water health
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:20.920]  food also freedom from disease proper education proper communications and
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:24.560]  of course fossil fuel electricity it's the cheapest kind of electricity and
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:28.760]  that lifts people out of poverty fast and anything it's only if you do lift
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:34.480]  them out of poverty that you bring poverty permanently to an end by ending
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:39.120]  overpopulation because overpopulation is caused by poverty and they know that the
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:42.640]  average person in the third world has about seven children five of them live
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:47.560]  on average and the Royal Commission said that in 49 you industrialized they
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:51.240]  have on average 1.3 children and if these people all believe in over
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:56.440]  population then make them rich but the globalists know their fight is to
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:01.080]  keep us poor they're fighting wealth they know that the normal state of
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:05.860]  humanity is to become more wealthy that's right and this is this is the main
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:10.720]  target now of these Marxists or totalitarians or legalists or call them
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:15.040]  what you will but they're very very unpleasant and ambitious people they
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:19.880]  have a hatred of their fellow humans some of them have even talked of wiping
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:24.160]  out six billion of the present seven billion human population
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:27.880]  don't stay there incredible I want you to break down the numbers on this you
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:33.440]  are one of the top experts on their plan and absolutely they hate everyone they
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:38.800]  see someone successful they hate it they have a primal dominance a twisted
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:41.760]  dominance though a true dominance wants to build everybody up they want to
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:46.600]  destroy we'll be back with Lord Monkton stay with us

[01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:00.280]  Moncton Lord Moncton I want to finish up with their eugenics agenda you were
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:03.280]  cut off by the break where you were talking about some of them want six
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:08.480]  billion of us dead they want green fascism you know they want hot baths
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:13.280]  for themselves but old lady should go without and we know who said that I mean
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:20.680]  this is a really scary group trying to sexy up feudalism so so break that down
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:24.280]  for us and then other tidbits that are on the radar screen because I've been
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:28.920]  asking the questions and then we're going to calls. What's happening here is
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:33.640]  that the world's governing class has got out of hand it's got used to the
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:41.160]  uniquely new ability to tax people with great certainty and to a very large
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:44.760]  proportion of their income this makes government far more wealthy than ever it
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:49.240]  was under any communist country and they're using their power and their
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:54.800]  wealth to increase that power and wealth still further and they have come to
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:37:00.840]  realize that the biggest cost they now face is in looking after their own poor
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:06.000]  people and in making contributions to the party of others further afield and it
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.960]  has occurred to some of them it's really very straightforward that the
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:13.240]  simplest thing to do would be to kill all those no account poor people that
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:18.760]  don't matter so that they themselves can be even richer still this is the kind of
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:24.560]  childish thinking and indeed very sinister thinking that is now prevailing
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:29.680]  among the governing class and it's dressed up behind this green fig leaf of
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:34.720]  environmentalism to make it sound acceptable to people who ought to know
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:40.880]  better I had a pointy head email me just today saying that he is a profit and he
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:45.600]  foresees that we won't see any climate trouble in the next hundred years that
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:49.320]  you know they've kind of got that one but it's going to be in 500 years time
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:53.840]  and he is the profit of doom in 500 years time he knows perfectly well he'll be
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:57.800]  dead and the rest of us will be by then so he can make whatever prophecies he
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:01.000]  likes and it won't make any difference this is the kind of pointy headed
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:06.760]  stupidity that is now becoming all too commonplace among people who would
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:11.560]  previously have been properly educated in the Aristotelian canons of logic in
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:15.680]  the Pythagorean canons of mathematics in the Ciceroanian and Periclian
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:21.480]  canons of politics and they would have a better understanding of how not to be so
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:26.920]  cruel is stupid because the point is that what these people are doing to the
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:31.480]  world is they are trying to destroy it they say they're trying to save it and
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:36.240]  preserve it like some sort of museum piece in aspic you only have to look at
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:42.760]  the record of extinctions in the past to see that this is quite a violent place
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:46.560]  because of the weather because of the volcanoes because of the meteorites
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:52.280]  because the sun occasionally grows dim all these things have major impacts down
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:57.120]  here they have much greater impacts than anything we can do and these have
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:03.060]  caused mass extinctions in the past we now have the capacity to cause mass
[01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:07.640]  extinctions if we were to use widespread nuclear weapons for instance but by
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:11.280]  adding a little bit of carbon dioxide to the climate we're not actually going to
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:15.360]  make very much difference apart from making things a lot more agreeable and
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:19.240]  warmer in places like Scotland by the way since you raised that just
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:23.000]  interrupt Lord Monkton since you brought up the Sun when you were at Copenhagen
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.960]  three years ago really routing them and then had the police beat you up and all
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:30.440]  the rest of it and of course that's the they've gone after you at other events
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:34.520]  as well and it's been caught on tape here's National Geographic solar
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:39.680]  super storms how they could impact our high-tech world and all the mainline
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:43.800]  scientists you know say that the Sun's the main driver a child knows that it's
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:49.760]  variations but they had a vote and the UN said to counter you and others that we
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:54.280]  vote that the Sun has no effect I mean this is this is cuckoo this is like
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:57.680]  saying the Sun doesn't make the Sun come up in the morning I mean this really
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:02.560]  shows their their I guess it's not child like authoritarianism they're used to a
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:05.720]  population that just believes whatever they say but how do they counter
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:10.320]  National Geographic even admits and it's a big you know pro eugenicist outfit
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:16.440]  anti-human deal that the Sun's driving climate I mean it seems like the are they
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:22.000]  letting reality in I mean why I think finally reality is beginning to break
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.240]  through see the left have made three rather big mistakes perhaps strategic
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:33.520]  mistakes in the last few years first of all they created the European Union as a
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:37.800]  communist bureaucratic centralist oligarchy rather like the old Soviet
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:42.920]  Union in Russia that has now failed as all such communist systems are bound to
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:47.320]  fail because the money to pay for it has run out then they switched on to this
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:52.080]  global warming bandwagon that has now failed which is why they've suddenly
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:55.920]  realized that they can no longer get away with saying to people that climate
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:00.120]  change is the worst problem the world faces because it isn't the worst problem
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:05.440]  the world faces is poverty and getting the UN to do anything about poverty is
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:10.280]  completely hopeless money that goes to the UN tends to stay at the UN paying
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:15.080]  for the lavish lifestyles of the people who run it so the third mistake I think
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:20.960]  the left have made is to attempt to set up a global government without having a
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:24.800]  good reason to do so they've tried to pretend that first of all global warming
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:27.880]  was the good reason then they tried to prevent that that protecting the
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:31.280]  environment is a good reason neither of these is a good reason for a world
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:35.720]  government and even if there were to be a world government I've said it before
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:41.120]  I'm going to say it again then that government should only receive power by
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:46.160]  treaty from democratic nations provided that that world government shall have
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:50.160]  been elected by the peoples of the state's parties to the convention
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:56.080]  creating it and they should not simply be self-appointed as they are now let the
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:00.320]  UN and the law of the sea conference you mentioned a few moments ago and the
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:05.120]  World Bank and the IMF and all the plethora of international organizations
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:09.440]  that now make our life a misery prodigiously at our expense let all of
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:16.320]  them either face election by the peoples of the world or be shut down that's how
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:20.840]  I think we've now got to to go Alex what we've got to do is we can stand on the
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:25.520]  sidelines and moan or we can do something about it what I think we now need is a
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:30.920]  new global constitution that says that any power transferred to any
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:35.720]  supranational or global institution shall only be transferred from elected
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:40.880]  hands in individual nation-states to elected hands in these international
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:44.280]  organizations no international organization should be allowed to have
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:49.760]  any fiscal or legislative power any power over our lives at all and you know
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:53.560]  why that's smart obviously I mean explain to people Lord Monkton why that's so
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:57.160]  intelligent because then you counter their whole oh we need an international
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:02.760]  debating society okay you your dictatorial you're making 83% of UK laws
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:07.480]  and the UK's not even you know as you've exposed and I just saw a national poll
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:12.960]  were over 80% you know one out now I saw another right at 80% when you really
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:16.640]  point out to people this is authoritarian world government it's not just
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:20.240]  world government say okay let's get rid of your authoritarian one and let's
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:25.720]  debate a a a elected one then I mean then you've taken the wind out of their
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:31.920]  sails that's exactly it the left are have always been terrified of democracy
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:37.480]  because they know that in the end democracy will not allow the establishment
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:40.840]  of these dictatorial entities or even if they allow it to be established as we
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:45.800]  made the mistake of doing with the EU now it's all falling apart under the
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:50.080]  weight of its own stupidity and expense and the greed of the politicians and
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:54.560]  bureaucrats that run it and you know there are now 30,000 bureaucrats in the
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:57.480]  EU heaven knows what they all do but every single one of them has a
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:01.360]  diplomatic passport at least a hundred thousand dollars a year free motor
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:05.520]  cars free travel free perks diplomatic immunity you name it they oh yeah let me
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:09.480]  bring that up I was about how can LeGrand the head of the IMF who has
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:15.120]  diplomatic immunity tax exempt under EU rules all this that she helped make how
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:20.400]  can she say Greece needs to pay more to bail out the bankers when she's exempt
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:24.880]  from those taxes I mean what a disconnected Marie Antoinette let them
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:30.040]  eat cake moment well that is very well put again Alex because the governing
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:35.600]  class has become predatory it's become greedy it's like a wolf taking chunks
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:39.960]  out of a passing child little red riding hood is losing and the wolf is
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:45.080]  winning if you like and this greed on the part of the governing class should
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:49.040]  never be underestimated I saw this when I worked at 10 Downing Street
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:53.360]  ministers jockey to see who could get the nicest grace and favor resident who
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:57.720]  get the largest ministerial car who could get the best ministerial paintings
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:02.040]  hung in their office this kind of terrible greed at the expense of the
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:06.480]  general taxpayer and that is really why poverty continues to exist in the West
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:11.560]  it's because the the super rich and that is in fact the governing class not not
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:17.140]  any longer a commercial class this super rich governing class now treats the
[01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:22.360]  people with such absolute contempt and so what I think we now need is and I'm
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:29.040]  gradually assembling this a group of fine minds internationally people who
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:32.960]  believe in the principles that are so wonderfully enshrined in the United
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:38.280]  States Constitution and say right we now need to have a similar Constitution for
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:44.560]  world as a whole so that if and when any further powers are transferred from
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:49.040]  nation-states to super national global institutions they will be transferred to
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:55.520]  institutions which respect the principles of that US Constitution not just
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:00.960]  democracy but also the separation of powers well you call that 1776 worldwide
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:05.360]  let me bring up one more point going back to National Geographic page 44 in the
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:08.920]  current issue or mock them ago go to calls perhaps you stay up in into the
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:12.240]  next hours we have time to get to all of them because we got you on a bit late
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:20.280]  my fault today they show they on page 44 tracking a stormy Sun and they show
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:27.240]  NASA from the first measurements in the mid 1950s they were very scientific of
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:32.600]  the Sun these these solar maximums and minimums and they go on to admit it
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:36.720]  affects the space weather the earth weather and they have the gauge the
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:41.440]  biggest one was in 1989 we've seen another big spike in the Sun as of late
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:45.600]  that you've covered and then they're predicting the next big spike coming
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:50.320]  soon but this the UN voted they said that the Sun doesn't do anything to the
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:54.360]  earth and it doesn't change and I mean could I pay Al Gore a carbon
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:58.600]  indulgence Lord Monkton and could maybe he make the Sun behave itself I mean is
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:04.280]  my SUV because I'm gonna be honest I got a big truck in an SUV I mean are those
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:09.120]  causing the Sun to do this am I bad can I could I fund the UN killing some black
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:13.240]  people would that make this okay well now that you've made your confession on
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:18.160]  the air your sins of emission are hereby forgiven good thank you by the point
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:22.880]  really is of course that the Sun is the dominant driver of our climate it's
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:28.640]  where the the warmth in global warming comes from in the first place and as you
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:35.920]  rightly say the 2001 I think it was 2007 fourth assessment report of the UN's
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:40.200]  climate panel this multi-thousand page piece of garbage they come up with every
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:43.960]  few years they voted this was government representatives they weren't even
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:49.960]  scientists they voted that with 90% certainty it was we and not the Sun
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:54.320]  that had the most influence on the climate China had said there should be no
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:59.080]  such vote at all some people said there should be 95% certainty and of course
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:03.480]  you can't put perhaps they should vote that gravity doesn't exist and if they
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:08.120]  voted we would suddenly float off the earth well that's right all they want
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:11.760]  to do is pass a vote and they can change science it's rather like trying to tell
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:16.080]  Galileo that the earth doesn't go around the Sun you know this this kind of thing
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:20.640]  hasn't worked in the past isn't going to work now what is I think astonishing to
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:25.200]  me is that you and I Alex were brought up in the age of reason and enlightenment
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:30.160]  in which science was supposed to be free from these kind of mindless and stupid
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:36.400]  political or religious beliefs and now here we are back into a religious
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:40.800]  belief that global warming is terrible it talks about Durbin they actually said
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:46.200]  now it's just mother Gaia that they're they're going right to the worship like
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:50.920]  avatar they're going right it's a very atavistic approach if you like they're
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:55.600]  going back to the Tibetan Buddhism which which regards the largest mountain
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:01.040]  the world Mount Everest as Tumulangma which means the goddess mother earth and
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:07.840]  they're going back to this frankly pre medieval prehistoric tribalist sort of
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:12.840]  shamanic religion rather than science and it's a very very strange thing and
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:17.320]  this mark my words Alex this is what's going to bring the left down
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:21.520]  internationally because you can politicize just about everything you
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:24.880]  touch in the way that the left so poisonously does the one thing you can't
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:29.840]  politicize is scientific truth either it is so that we're going to see rapid
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:34.600]  warming or it isn't so and within a few years it will become all too apparent to
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:39.160]  everybody yes so they've committed the peltdown man sin they've they've you
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:43.040]  know they've taken a monkey bone or an eight bone and put a pig jaw in it and
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:47.840]  they've been found out and now no one's going to leave anything they say no
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:51.280]  exactly the jawbone of an ass and a pig's ear have been combined to make
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:55.880]  goodness knows what monster but they are the left is now on the way out they
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:59.080]  don't realize it yet they think they're dominant throughout politics they control
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:03.920]  the media they make fun of the likes of you and me but it is they who are now
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:08.080]  finished because they've made this colossal mistake of climbing onto the
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:11.600]  climate bang bag and just as all the wheels are falling off they've tried to
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:17.840]  politicize science itself and like it or not you can't do that all right well
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:20.840]  we're gonna go to break here and maybe keep you 15 minutes the next hour because
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:25.640]  I know people really chomping to talk to you Chris Richard John Mike Ronnie we're
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:30.440]  gonna go to all of you they all want to talk about a jenna 21 other questions
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:35.600]  they're actually Chris has a question of a reactor question but these are
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:43.680]  questions for Lord Moncton like I told folks 800 2 5 9 9 2 3 1 yes we have a
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:48.720]  several reactors here in Austin the problem is they don't upkeep them and
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:52.520]  in the word is they've been hiding waste around places so I certainly don't
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:51:00.560]  want to be glowing glowing green so we'll be right back with Lord Moncton
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:04.700]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non
[01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:08.440]  hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:12.280]  that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or

[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:38.280]  our guest let's go to your phone calls we're gonna go to Mike Richard John and
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:43.920]  many others Mike in mass you're on the air welcome yeah how you doing today Alex
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:50.440]  pretty good I was wondering first of all with Lord Moncton I was I was listening
[01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:54.840]  to I think it was like an NPR affiliate they had some crazy lady on talking
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:59.560]  about how she related the earth saying that it's a living breathing creature
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:05.640]  and evidence by the changing seasons and she actually advocated that we
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:10.560]  need to go through the United Nations to create a crime that is above crimes of
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:15.400]  genocide for crimes against the earth and we need to process that was that was
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:20.600]  that was pushed at South Africa Lord Moncton yes you're quite right and there
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:24.680]  are a lot of people in the environmental movement who want to do this who
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:30.400]  have been fooled by James Love locks so-called Gaia hypothesis and of course
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:34.840]  the reason why the seasons come and go is very well understood it is because
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:39.640]  the earth's axis is at an angle to the plane of the ecliptic in which it
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:44.680]  orbits and therefore at one moment the north pole is closer to the sun the
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:48.760]  next moment the south pole is and at the equinoxes it's halfway in between and
[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:52.600]  that is what makes the seasons that's preposterous everybody knows there's
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:58.520]  blood inside the earth and it's actually a big well there you are exactly it's
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:02.600]  held up on the back of a huge man yes no I mean this is the extraordinary thing
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:07.360]  is that we're now going back to a sort of pathetic medieval or even prehistoric
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:13.160]  tribal witch doctor kind of religion replacing science and you get all of
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:18.200]  this gibberish about how the earth is hurting no it isn't the earth is more
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:24.280]  than capable of dealing with us and if we are sensible and look after it in a
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:29.000]  common-sense way as most western countries have long done then the earth
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.160]  will not come to any harm at all that's right let's go back to the caller sir
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:36.440]  I mean what else did this woman say because I mean I've heard I've seen it
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:40.120]  I hear it it's everywhere I mean humans have to be dealt with Gaia needs a
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:46.480]  little snack of blood yeah I'll tell you what Alex it was it was really
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:49.760]  ridiculous they kind of just gave her free range to talk about this stuff for
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:55.800]  about 20 to 30 minutes straight and she was saying that you know we need to go
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:59.960]  through the United Nations that that we're killing the earth that it's worse
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:02.800]  than killing that it's worse than genocide it's worse than a mass
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:08.800]  extermination that carbon emissions are bad having kids are bad polluting is
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:12.440]  bad everything's bad basically humans are evil and we need they need to be
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:15.720]  dealt with so well no let me spend on that I appreciate your points because
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:18.560]  I've seen and read that similar sentiment and then ignore real
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:22.040]  environmental issues just to say give world government power but I want to
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:26.320]  get Lord Monkton's comment on that I mean you know the caller is not
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:30.120]  exaggerating and and and what I've seen you in statements like in their
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:34.320]  biological diversity assessment 96 not the one on the web but the actual copy I
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:39.120]  have my film road to tyranny the full text they say ancient societies knew how
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:43.600]  to deal with overpopulation to not crust the breast of Mother Earth they had
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:47.400]  human sacrifice and that's what ancients did they said there's too many of us
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:51.520]  take them up to the top of the pyramid cut his heart out Lord Monkton yeah
[01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:55.000]  this is exactly what they're now advocating again I find it astonishing
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:00.160]  this this return to a kind of childish primitivism it's an enormous backward
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:04.560]  step for humankind but the great thing is that if we watch the left taking this
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:08.120]  step and it is all on the left nobody on the right is saying these these half
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:12.800]  baked things then gradually people will realize that they're no longer dealing
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:17.920]  with a rational political force they're dealing with maniacs who hate people they
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:22.640]  hate the earth in fact they would love to do harm to it by denying it the carbon
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:30.280]  dioxide after all which is the food of God unbelievable back in 60 seconds
[01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:35.240]  another hour straight ahead and then a huge news blitz and more calls believe
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:44.360]  me there's a lot of it straight ahead stay with us you are listening to GCN
[01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:52.440]  visit GCN live comm today this is Alex Jones with five good
[01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:56.440]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[01:58:56.440 --> 01:59:00.240]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:04.320]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:08.560]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:12.840]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:16.840]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:21.200]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:24.920]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:29.080]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:32.880]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:36.400]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors

[02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:34.440]  then a big news blitz a lot of really important news Obama now announces he
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:37.360]  doesn't even need Congress on immigration he'll just legalize the
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:42.760]  illegals that's associated press that's called dictatorship let's go ahead and
[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:48.640]  talk to who's up next here we just talked to Mike in mass we're gonna move
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:55.800]  along now to Richard and Alberta Canada you're on the air with Lord Monkton go
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:01:03.000]  ahead hey I'd like to ask Lord Monkton a few questions but first if I might I
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:08.920]  would like to take a time to add deep a brief overview and how agenda 21 is
[02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:14.840]  being implemented in Canada here and recently Katie or Alberta and with the
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:22.760]  province where I'm from we just elected you former UN bureaucrats and New World
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:28.640]  Order operative Alison Redford as our premier she is pushing through a number
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:33.320]  of bills including the Land Stewardship Act which robbed Albertans of our
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:38.360]  natural property rights so they can take oh yeah and by the way Australia did
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:43.880]  this and took half of the farmland off limits they take half the land and set
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:49.400]  it aside or you can pay huge taxes on it and it's just devastating devastating
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:52.400]  these people Lord Monkton you've been to Australia a bunch I'm gonna go back to
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:56.320]  your caller but I mean he's not joking about these land grabs that give us your
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:02:00.520]  take on that well this is a growing problem in Australia I met one of the
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:04.560]  people who had his land grabbed and he and his family had been farming there
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:08.480]  quite peaceably for several generations then along comes the state
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:12.080]  government one day and says right we're confiscating your land because we need
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:16.840]  it for a carbon sink so that we can comply with our obligations under the
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:22.040]  treaty which Kevin Rudd signed you know the the one of the many global sounds
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:26.080]  like Mao Zedong and I've seen the polls there over 80% are against it but the
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:31.600]  authoritarians don't care this is exactly it they now regard everything and
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:35.600]  everybody's property as their own to do what they like with they want to take it
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:39.880]  away from people and put it in the hands of some sort of environmental
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:44.440]  management committee increasingly this is happening or they're trying to make
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:47.880]  it happen I'm glad to say that in Britain we're fighting back against this
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:52.160]  and we've said that property rights have to be respected in Australia they're
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:56.520]  still not doing that partly because the opposition has been rather ineffective
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:00.080]  they haven't really made enough noise they haven't stood up and opposed this
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:05.440]  and nobody has provided the funds to allow people who have had their property
[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:09.980]  effectively stolen from them and later later they give it to their buddies this
[02:03:09.980 --> 02:03:14.440]  happened in Austin they took 50,000 plus acres from the mid 90s on and then
[02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:18.400]  turned around and built on it they took it from farmers they just took it Lord
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:23.240]  Moncton and now I'm sorry go ahead happening all over America and all
[02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:28.040]  over the world where corrupt local and national governments are helping
[02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:31.800]  themselves to private land in the name of the environment and then simply
[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:35.600]  building on it destroying whatever environment it had and profiting mightily
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:38.560]  by robbing the people who previously owned it well that's what's sick I've
[02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:41.520]  gone to smart growth conferences and they just look at you and your cameras off
[02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:46.560]  and go yeah we know it's a scam and laugh at you I'm sorry go ahead
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:50.160]  you're quite right they know it's a scam and that that's the crucial thing
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:58.440]  they know that this is simply a method of organized robbery of the by the rich
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:02.440]  bureaucrat and the bureaucratic class real fast I want to have the caller in
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:06.400]  Canada no I've seen this she went to the Bilderberg this year how I mean her
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:09.960]  Canadians aware you're about to go under the same land grab that just happened
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:15.560]  in Australia unfortunately most of us are oblivious I'm telling you documentry I'm
[02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:19.040]  trying to do other YouTube channel I'm trying to inform people as best I can but
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:24.040]  most people they're such status they have their there's they worship the
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:28.280]  gravel to government it's it's quite pathetic here they they don't have a
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:31.360]  they don't have the spirit of 1776 they don't have the spirit of liberty they
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:35.800]  don't have this fire in their belly it's quite the static but I was going on
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:40.600]  before they're also another bill that they're passing Alison Redford is she's
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:45.680]  talking about how basically they're doing a mess over the power line which is
[02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:51.160]  going to read the cost of energy here in Alberta and it's I'm an awful giant scams
[02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:54.880]  we'll be back with more calls yeah these people are total criminals they know
[02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:59.480]  exactly what they're doing Lord Moncton straight ahead
[02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:05.840]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs

[02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:12.920]  friends I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar
[02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:18.320]  none is propure and it's available discounted at info wars.com its filters
[02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:22.080]  are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth there's no priming
[02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:27.560]  required it's NSF 42 certified optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:32.760]  to 95% easy to set up and use doesn't require electricity purify water from
[02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:37.360]  lake streams ponds and wells this filter system leaves in beneficial minerals
[02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:41.560]  which is key save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches
[02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:45.360]  from the plastic propure is the best gravity-fed filter out there it's what
[02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:50.280]  my family uses info wars.com already has the lowest price on propure but if you
[02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:54.800]  add the promo code water at checkout you get an additional 10% off and info

[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:05.560]  you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:09.000]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:12.800]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:16.480]  seeds about perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible
[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:20.200]  that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:24.600]  put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival
[02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:29.600]  seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and
[02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:32.840]  your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically
[02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:36.960]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre

[02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:12.320]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:19.840]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:31.920]  Texas Alex Jones well Obama's Axelrod has announced they want to try to pass a
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:36.280]  law restricting free speech you can't make this up the Department of Labor
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:39.960]  wants to ban children doing chores and on farms you know about that well now
[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:43.960]  they want to have people that report on the economy have to get government
[02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:48.680]  issued computers we talked about that earlier in the week it's just so crazy
[02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:54.080]  they're using al-Qaeda to attack Syria I'm not saying Assad's a good guy but I
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:58.320]  mean I'm supposed to give my rights up because al-Qaeda and then now the NATO
[02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:02.960]  and folks are funding them the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is funding
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:07.400]  research into bracelets that track mental and emotional responses in school to
[02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:11.400]  make sure you're being brainwashed properly Lou Rockwells came out on the
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:14.960]  show yesterday that video is up at info wars.com Ron Paul will not endorse
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:19.800]  Mitt Romney it's also all mirrored at prisonplanet.com and killer drones
[02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:23.280]  coming to a sky near you and they're announcing their number one mission will
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:27.140]  be to enforce the environment the spy satellites are not pointed at the
[02:09:27.140 --> 02:09:30.840]  Russians now they're pointed at us and they've got the Air Force drones
[02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:36.880]  enforcing your cows if water runs off any brown water into the local creek the
[02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:42.080]  giant finds any hay dust $2,000 a day finds there's no law they're just doing
[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:45.880]  it Lord Monty I'm gonna rush through some calls in this final segment with you
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:49.880]  but I've noticed in the UK also in the EU and I've seen the same thing the
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:55.120]  announcements that drones and spy satellites are now watching the farmers
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:10:01.160]  what but not big agra watching the small endangered family farm I noticed
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:04.560]  Stalin kicked people off the farms and tried to collect their eyes and killed
[02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:08.520]  tens of millions Mao did it he has the record our government says he killed 64
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:12.560]  million Chinese say 86 million but one of the cases I know you've studied that
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:16.640]  and travel the world why why did the quote environmental fascist
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:22.080]  communist always want to get people off their land for the earth of course and
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:26.480]  ban the Amish selling milk I mean why is there this attack on rural communities
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:32.480]  by the whatever you call these creatures they're jealous that's what it is
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:37.960]  they want the land which is now occupied by the farmers the best way to do
[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:41.480]  that is to invent some fictional reason why the farmers ought to have to take it
[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:46.040]  off them and that's why they have these drones now flying around watching us
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:49.120]  it's bad enough having Google Earth being able to see straight into your
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:54.160]  bathroom window now you've got these drones as well so you need to wear a
[02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:58.240]  hoodie and a baseball cap at all times even inside the house and they can't
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:04.480]  see who you are it's really got to the point now where you know one would
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:08.680]  almost feel justified in shooting some of these drones down if they came over us
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:14.960]  I mean it's outrageous the way the the authorities feel that they can treat
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:19.520]  the ordinary people with complete contempt now I'm not advocating that
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:25.120]  you should actually shoot these drones down but certainly I think it's now
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:29.720]  become a real worry that we have for instance in Britain more surveillance
[02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:35.720]  camera cameras on every street corner than anyone else in the world I told you
[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:41.480]  on the last program that I had an inland revenue spy getting into my club the
[02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:46.160]  other day and asking me questions and it was only halfway through the
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:50.600]  conversation that I realized who he was this kind of game that's being played
[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:57.120]  with the citizen by the authorities and these little secret police I think we're
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:00.480]  all criminals it's like a little mental illness they have and they they act like
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:04.200]  we're bad just because we want freedom and they all think they're James Bond
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:08.880]  let's go to the calls we've again got science and public policy dot org
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:13.400]  proprietor Lord Christopher Moncton the third by count of Moncton and
[02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:19.840]  Brinchley on with us leading fighter of these green tyrants let's talk to who's
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:24.520]  been holding the longest here John in Montana mountain country you're on the
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:30.520]  air go ahead hello gentlemen my question is on agenda 21 human rights in the
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:36.320]  future of form governments in the world or in the United States they use the
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:40.320]  semantics and legal interpretation and the government stepped the plan and
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:45.680]  other items from the people can I have Lord Christopher Moncton speak on that
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:52.080]  and then have you Alex don't speak on the constitutionality of that yes yes go
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:57.520]  ahead let me go first on this the the your constitution which I keep by me at
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:04.480]  all times says that the supreme law of the United States is the constitution
[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:12.600]  alongside the laws made by Congress and any treaty made by the Senate in
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:17.360]  accordance with the provisions in the Constitution that too becomes your law
[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:22.840]  and this is where the danger is increasingly what is happening is that
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:29.560]  presidents like president Obama who tend to put everybody but America first will
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:35.080]  agree to these treaties over and over again now they realize they can't get
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:38.320]  them through the Senate because there are still senators who are willing to
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:42.440]  stand up for America and as you know the treaty shouldn't become a treaty
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:47.280]  unless the Senate says it should but there's a kind of get-out clause which
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:51.240]  the Supreme Court has been using it's been saying that even if the Senate
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:55.600]  doesn't make a treaty but yet a particular international agreement is
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:14:01.440]  something which all nations ought to be taking part in then even if the Senate
[02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:06.280]  hasn't voted for it it's increasingly being treated in law as though it were
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:12.720]  yes yes this is a big problem it means it means that one cannot merely hope
[02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:17.840]  that the people that you elect to defend you from precisely the kind of power
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:22.200]  grab that's going on by the governing class worldwide will actually be able
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:26.520]  to defend you from it because the Supreme Court as at present constituted
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:31.600]  is beginning to over over look and overrule your constitutional what do
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:34.680]  you call it an international law I guess an oligarchy where it's the
[02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:39.640]  bureaucracy special corporate interests that are anti-free market working as
[02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:43.400]  monopoly men with an executive doing what it wants I guess that's really
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:48.160]  fascism or an oligarchy because now Obama says I'm gonna legalize the
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:51.560]  illegals no law I'm gonna shut down the power plant that's how we started the
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:55.360]  interview and I mean really now everybody's calling him a dictator but
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:59.400]  again it's a special interest at running so the dictator you know the titular
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:02.600]  heads come and go but they're bought and paid for by the same interest I mean
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:07.560]  how do you respond to something that lawless well what you do is there is a
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:12.200]  procedure in United States law as there is in United Kingdom law called
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:17.440]  application for judicial review of administrative action and this means that
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:24.160]  any public servant who acts beyond his powers can be taken to court and made to
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:28.200]  behave just as we took the Department of Education here in the UK to court
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:33.760]  because it didn't have the power to hand out Al Gore's propaganda movie this
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:37.800]  more kiss sci-fi comedy horror movie appears it didn't have the power to hand
[02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:41.640]  that out to schools because it was propaganda and propaganda in schools in
[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:46.640]  the UK is against the law and we won the case and therefore they had to send out
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:51.960]  77 pages of corrective guidance to each school before the film could be shown
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:57.000]  that and this really is the the key thing you need to find people who are
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:02.960]  wealthy enough to be able to fight cases on judicial review so if Obama says he's
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:08.000]  going to have an amnesty for illegal immigrants then he must go to Congress to
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:13.600]  get that he cannot do that by executive order and if he tries then somebody
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:18.600]  should take him to court and say no you can't do that how powerful you are you
[02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:24.360]  have to abide by exactly until Congress changes the law of the land that's the
[02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:28.000]  way it works in a democracy that's what you're founding fathers that it
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:31.800]  intended and that's what you must insist on very well said let's jump to some more
[02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:39.000]  calls mr. Baction let's talk to Lloyd in Florida listening on the big 810 a.m. or
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:42.760]  number one there in Orlando on agenda 21 you're on the air with Lord Montyn go
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:49.320]  ahead Alex I want to thank Lord Montyn for his wonderful information that he's
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:53.200]  putting out but I'd like you to put me on hold I want to talk to you on a
[02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:56.960]  different subject when he finishes okay well it said it's in a 21 right there
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:17:00.040]  but you have a quick question for him and I come back to you later just come
[02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:03.360]  back to me later okay it said it's in a 21 there on the screen that's what we
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:07.680]  don't really screen your calls we have a guest it's a let's go ahead and talk to
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:14.960]  Jeffrey in Colorado you're on the air but Jeffrey well you got that anyway I
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:20.680]  just found you guys earlier this year thank God for your message and what
[02:17:20.680 --> 02:17:25.360]  you're doing and that probably comes from those of us who care about America
[02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:30.480]  together thank you do you have any questions for Lord Montyn yes you're
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:34.920]  going to the summit what I was wondering is there a possibility to be able to
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:41.000]  post the names of everybody involved in this massive takeover and if or post
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:47.240]  their pictures because you need to start taking an offense instead of a defense
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:52.640]  well that's quite a good idea to name them and shame them as I did to this
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:58.160]  inland revenue spy the other day Dr. Paul McCallum and that's that's a very
[02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:03.920]  good technique and I think a lot of us who have access to the media should do
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:09.320]  this more often we should name and shame those in the public authorities who
[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:14.360]  overstep the bounds of their authority and go too far and try to set up these
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:19.360]  these global governments now of course in practice the only people who know who's
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:23.840]  going to Rio are the UN organizers and they certainly won't give out the
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:28.440]  list to anyone but that one of the purposes in being there is that we can
[02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:33.520]  see which organizations are there we can work out who is funding them and then
[02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:37.360]  we have learned a trick from the left we are now quietly talking to the funders
[02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:41.040]  of some of these big so-called charitable environmental organizations
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:44.520]  which are in effect about the destruction of the planet and we're
[02:18:44.520 --> 02:18:48.600]  saying take your funding elsewhere these people are crooks you don't want to be
[02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:53.120]  associated with them when they eventually get exposed and go under and the
[02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:56.000]  funding is leaving them and again you call them the left I know they identify
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:00.600]  themselves as that I just see them as authoritarians posing as planet savers
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:04.280]  I mean because there are some people that associate you know the left with
[02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:07.800]  civil liberties things like that but you never really see that from them I mean
[02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:13.320]  you think the left is the proper name for them well the left is the name for
[02:19:13.320 --> 02:19:17.760]  traditionally in our politics for the totalitarian faction if you are a
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:23.240]  totalitarian then you're on the left the national socialists in Germany they
[02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:27.920]  were on the left Hitler's fascists they were on the left Stalin now Stalin
[02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:33.640]  Mao Tung the El Castro oh yeah all of these people they are on the left they
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:37.840]  are authoritarians they're not authoritative I guess that is a point that I
[02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:41.200]  guess I mean most of the mass murderers claim they come from the left Lord

[02:33:21.880 --> 02:33:25.560]  other tidbits of news. Now Luke Radowski is independent media we are
[02:33:25.560 --> 02:33:30.200]  changed that's a great job there's hundreds and hundreds of chapters all
[02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:34.200]  of the world I don't know looks like 25 or something now started out as a 9-11
[02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:38.920]  activist in New York they didn't want him talking about the New World Order so he
[02:33:38.920 --> 02:33:44.200]  started his own group and has had a great effect now he lives in DC now and he
[02:33:44.200 --> 02:33:49.760]  goes and confronts these people every day Lord Rothschild the Rockefellers I
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:55.400]  mean it's amazing what he does asking real questions very politely and it's
[02:33:55.400 --> 02:33:58.840]  constantly making news and having a big effect and getting key information now
[02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:02.560]  now he's interviewed Rand Paul many times Rand will stop talk about the New
[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:06.640]  World Order as a senator as a candidate as well talk about Bilderberg being a
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:12.000]  threat and again Rand Paul overalls against the drones he voted no on the
[02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:17.680]  NDAA only one of seven senators there's a lie out there that he voted for it he's
[02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:21.640]  a friend Ron Paul is absolutely awesome Rand kind of going in a bad
[02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:27.400]  direction but you know whatever we're just saying we don't like it but Luke
[02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:31.200]  keeps running into him and he's actually at a converse today he ran into him
[02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:34.160]  yesterday we're about to play a clip of that video ran into him again today
[02:34:34.160 --> 02:34:38.200]  ran when he got a bunch of security guards look very upset that video's
[02:34:38.200 --> 02:34:44.360]  coming out here's a minute of it where Luke comes up and wants to talk to him
[02:34:44.360 --> 02:34:50.960]  here it is hey senator Paul my name is Luke of we are change we had an
[02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:54.560]  interesting conversation before about the Bilderberg group and knowing what you
[02:34:54.560 --> 02:34:59.080]  know how can you support Mitt Romney when the Guardian reported he was at the
[02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:09.280]  Bilderberg meeting I know you it's a comfortable question I know you know a
[02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:14.120]  lot about the Bilderberg group and we just want to know why would you endorse
[02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:21.960]  I know you're playing politics but this politics really that dirty okay that's
[02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:29.960]  enough he just acts like he's not there and he's Luke's interviewed before and
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:33.920]  then they follow him into the you know the Senate area then they go in their
[02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:39.160]  private area and they stop then he ran into him again today and you know the
[02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:43.000]  issue here is if I had to really go somewhere I would at least say I got to
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:47.080]  go somewhere I can't really talk to you but this is clear they don't even brush
[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:51.160]  you off with a quick answer even you know globalists will do that sometimes I
[02:35:51.160 --> 02:35:55.000]  mean I've seen Jay Rockefeller respond more than this and so what I'm seeing
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:36:00.200]  here in the body language is that well Rand isn't very happy with the patriot
[02:36:00.200 --> 02:36:05.640]  movement we don't want to push Rand and Luke isn't doing this too far because he
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:08.200]  made we may drive him right into the arms of the globalist but that's still
[02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:12.200]  his fault if he does that you can't use threats to your family or whatever as an
[02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:16.120]  excuse to join the dark side Rand still overall has a great voting record we
[02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:20.800]  don't like to Mitt Romney thing but again it's really academic in the final
[02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:25.640]  equation Luke Radowski tell us what happened yesterday and now what happened
[02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:29.400]  today the conference you're at right now and what's happening there joining us
[02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:33.040]  via cell phone from DC Luke Radowski of we are change.org
[02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:36.560]  yeah I was just running through the park a lot here trying to find Glenn Beck just
[02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:40.560]  got Glenn Beck new king rates I've been having a crazy time I live in New York City
[02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:45.560]  but I travel down to DC whenever I get you know just tired of New York City and
[02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:49.440]  I want to do some work down here you had been living down there I forgot but go
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:54.120]  ahead yeah I've been living down there and we we decided you know to talk to
[02:36:54.120 --> 02:36:57.800]  Mr. Rand Paul and we were in the Senate building we saw him coming out that we
[02:36:57.800 --> 02:37:02.480]  saw him coming out you know I just politely walked up to him I mean I've
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:06.000]  talked to other senators who granted me interviews and we're talking to me and
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:09.920]  we're more open and I just wanted to politely talk to him about his Mitt
[02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:14.320]  Romney Bill Perkelsman Sacks endorsement which doesn't make much sense to me
[02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:17.800]  knowing what Rand Paul knows and I was trying to be as polite as I could and I
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:21.200]  just try to have a conversation with him and he was doing everything in his
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:25.080]  power to not talk to me and then you know when he ignored me I got Abbie Maher
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:29.760]  in a media route to come with me we went inside the Senate building we saw
[02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:33.120]  Rand Paul walking right towards us I gave Abbie them to the mic and then you
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:36.080]  could see what happened from there on the YouTube video today we're at this
[02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:40.080]  conference Rand Paul was here we were at the secret entrance where all the
[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:44.760]  speakers were coming in and out of now Rand Paul came out and he saw me and he
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:48.920]  quickly ran back inside and now his staffer that blonde lady that was with
[02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:53.400]  him was running around they got about 10 security guards to be around him he
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:57.560]  usually walks around with himself and his aide that blonde lady but now he got
[02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:01.440]  10 security guards they're all pointing to me looking at me and I'm like I just
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:05.960]  want to you know have a conversation with this guy and they even closed off the
[02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:10.280]  public book signing into a private room they have to change the book signing I
[02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:14.840]  mean Glenn Beck does it in the public area they made it into a private area
[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:20.120]  because of Rand's request even when he was walking with you know a lot of
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:23.280]  security guards around him I still got the mic in there and I was like you know
[02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:28.160]  do you how do you support Mitt Romney's do you still speak how do you stand
[02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:31.680]  with since you're gonna be campaigning for Mitt Romney as you said I asked him
[02:38:31.680 --> 02:38:35.120]  you know where do you stand with him on the NDAA on ending the private
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:39.240]  better reserve and it's foreign policy with Iran and then again he did the same
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:42.400]  thing he just didn't answer him though the mic was right next to him I was right
[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:45.560]  next to him with all these security guards pushing me all I'm trying to do is
[02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:48.920]  open the dialogue because you know this is very weird and we're just trying to
[02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:53.120]  have a conversation we're just trying to understand what everything is
[02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:58.240]  happening well you're right and we're showing some of this footage while you
[02:38:58.240 --> 02:39:03.240]  talk for for prison planet TV viewers for radio listeners we just posted the
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:07.680]  video at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com it's also on the we are change
[02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:12.960]  YouTube account that's so prolific we're gonna have you back soon on Skype just
[02:39:12.960 --> 02:39:17.560]  to go through the Lord Rothschild confrontation which is amazing the Ted
[02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:21.440]  Turner all of it I mean you guys are on fire I mean back in the old days when
[02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:25.480]  I could front Janet Reno or other globalist really pioneering just asking
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:28.840]  a real question and watching them all collapse I can never imagine it would
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:33.640]  become so prolific and in a watch you trailblaze others are obviously following
[02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:38.280]  shoe and it's got we want yeah we want other people to do this because that's
[02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:41.200]  how we're safe but that's how we get the truth out you can only have a lead in
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:45.200]  to the truth and it could be destroyed by the truth it should be and that's our
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:48.360]  major philosophy here and we are change we're just trying to open up the
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:52.400]  dialogue find out what's going on we had an awesome last three days all the
[02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:56.480]  videos will be up on youtube.com youtube.com forward slash we are change I
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:39:59.840]  mean we just got Glenn back we just got newt king rich tell us what happened I
[02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:03.080]  want to go through Glenn Beck and again rich you know audibly as a reporter what
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:06.080]  happened before we see the video breaking that here but I got to say
[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:10.560]  watching watching his body language knowing Rand Paul you know interviewing
[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:13.440]  him back when he was the only guy that would do interviews for his dad over 10
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:17.600]  years ago I think it's well over 10 years remember interviewing him like in 98
[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:22.440]  or something you know sending crews out to interview him at Austin talking to
[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:28.360]  him off air and now he's he's he his whole body language has shifted in the
[02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:32.080]  last few months I think they may have offered him the VP or he's told he's
[02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:36.480]  in the running because he acts like a man on a mission and he says it's very
[02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:41.200]  honored I'm a guy from a small town you know I mean I think he's been offered it
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:44.500]  now he's gone from there were no secret meetings to oh I don't think there were
[02:40:44.500 --> 02:40:48.920]  really any meetings I'm seeing everything change the office says the same
[02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:54.360]  thing and again I'm not saying Rand's a bad guy but he's really changed what do
[02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:58.880]  you say to that look the only way to really find out the truth is to walk up
[02:40:58.880 --> 02:41:02.360]  to him and to have a conversation and to have a dialogue when he doesn't say
[02:41:02.360 --> 02:41:07.160]  anything and when he knowingly ignores you when you are as nice as you can that's
[02:41:07.160 --> 02:41:09.960]  when we should be worried and I am worried and that's why I'm trying to
[02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:13.720]  make an effort to talk to him to understand what he's been doing and I
[02:41:13.720 --> 02:41:17.000]  hope other people take charge and other people take responsibility and instead
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:23.040]  of just calling in names and names and you know just going negativity Adam
[02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:26.080]  they should walk up to him and have a conversation and find out what's going
[02:41:26.080 --> 02:41:29.440]  on and share it with the world yeah well I mean look our listeners are
[02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:32.360]  everywhere and Rand's come on and said oh the info wars people are everywhere
[02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:37.560]  all of them and so everybody should be polite about Rand even told me he
[02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:40.880]  learned about the bill the bird group through you I had a I had a long
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:44.720]  conversation with him right before he became a senator and YouTube video was
[02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:48.840]  out just last week right when he announced the Mitt Romney yeah I've been so
[02:41:48.840 --> 02:41:51.680]  busy I didn't even watch the whole thing we played a clip on the news of him
[02:41:51.680 --> 02:41:54.560]  saying at Bilderberg should be investigated you're saying in that same
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:42:00.080]  video he says he learned it from us yeah we have a whole long yeah yeah I should
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:03.800]  be up there but we had a whole longer dialogue with him about you know what's
[02:42:03.800 --> 02:42:06.360]  the name of that video I'll play on the nightly news tonight I know it's all
[02:42:06.360 --> 02:42:15.800]  the other one the new one what's the name of it it was Rand Paul yeah I mean here's the thing I've had private conversations with
[02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:19.840]  Rand I mean he really hates the new world order yeah I don't want to say
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:27.200]  intuition or whatever but I mean I just feel like they've got something on him
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:34.520]  and they're using I don't whether it's threats or my gut tells me I mean the
[02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:38.920]  point is is that is that I think they've really dug into things and and I
[02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:42.200]  think they're blackmailing him or something I mean again I have no proof
[02:42:42.200 --> 02:42:46.880]  of that my gut tells me he doesn't even look like he's on a power trip he looks
[02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:51.760]  freaked out he looks like he's been given an offer he can't refuse and I'm
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:56.040]  good at gauging body language my instincts my subconscious is powerful my
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:42:59.360]  discernment I mean that's what my gut tells me so that's why we shouldn't
[02:42:59.360 --> 02:43:04.040]  attack Rand I got hurt at first I don't think he's bad he's still an ally I
[02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:08.840]  my gut this morning was if we really keep going after him though and I'm not
[02:43:08.840 --> 02:43:12.080]  saying you're doing that Luke I'm saying all of us you know too mainly I think
[02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:15.680]  we're gonna make him join the dark side what do you say Luke I don't agree with
[02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:19.640]  it just attacking anybody negatively there's there's always a good way to
[02:43:19.640 --> 02:43:23.840]  find out exactly what's happening and that's to try to be you know to try to
[02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:27.240]  open that dialogue that last video that is that you told me about it's called a
[02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:31.960]  Rand Paul before endorsing Romney on bill the Berg and Goldman Sachs that's the
[02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:35.640]  video that's the YouTube okay Rand Paul before endorsing Romney yeah we linked
[02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:39.320]  to on the side but only had time to watch the excerpt of it I wish I could
[02:43:39.320 --> 02:43:42.880]  watch all this stuff I'm so busy but we'll play that tonight so he said I
[02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:47.240]  woke him up to Bilderberg and so he knows who you are you've interviewed him
[02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:52.080]  all the and now he runs from you exactly it's pretty sad because he could
[02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:55.760]  have just opened up and explained himself now to rational conversation with me
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:44:00.280]  you know even if we disagreed I mean he thinks Ben Jones or he could say hey
[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:04.240]  come back tomorrow at this time or hey you know I mean I mean the big look he
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:09.280]  has that classic politician running from somebody his secretary said let's set a
[02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:12.760]  foot on appointment but they never do I've been working you know the Senate
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:16.600]  beat here for a while and I tried to make appointments with senator they never
[02:44:16.600 --> 02:44:21.240]  ever will get back to they never ever will request an interview especially when
[02:44:21.240 --> 02:44:24.120]  they know exactly when you're talking about real and foreign issues like to
[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:28.520]  build a Berg group so that was well yeah now you talked to him the other day or
[02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:32.600]  we are changed it up in Illinois and he said no comment at first he's talking
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:38.520]  to him they go Bilderberg Romney he's like no comment bam starts walking fast
[02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:42.920]  yeah I mean that's just pretty sad and that leaves a lot more questions than
[02:44:42.920 --> 02:44:47.000]  answers but you know we should just concentrate on the truth don't worry
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:51.920]  about the individuals or campaigns or different people what matters is you the
[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:55.120]  only change that will really happen comes from the bottom comes from the grass
[02:44:55.120 --> 02:44:58.960]  roots that that's you listening right now and we can't be discouraged we have
[02:44:58.960 --> 02:45:03.680]  to be encouraged to step up I hardly agree Luke tell me about what happened with
[02:45:03.680 --> 02:45:09.080]  Glenn Beck I gotta hear this yeah Glenn back he has so much security around him
[02:45:09.080 --> 02:45:12.920]  he has more security than secret service around him they're sneaking him around the
[02:45:12.920 --> 02:45:17.600]  back area so nobody no I've seen this guy with like 20 security before just
[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:22.200]  going to literally talk to 300 people because he couldn't fill the six flags
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:27.560]  I saw long footage you shot it and and and he had like 20 security with him to
[02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:32.040]  go speak to a couple hundred people at Six Flags in a multi-thousand arena it
[02:45:32.040 --> 02:45:36.080]  was like 300 showed up because they can't pay for the $200 tickets and I mean I
[02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:39.280]  can go have thousands show up at my events I can go stand in the middle of
[02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:43.560]  thousands of people no bodyguards no nothing I mean what is this living in
[02:45:43.560 --> 02:45:48.240]  total fear or is having all the security like your entourage like your pimp
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:53.040]  game yeah I have no idea but when he came around the secret area that had
[02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:56.800]  they had had had everything fenced off and when they had everything fenced up I
[02:45:56.800 --> 02:46:00.480]  was able to get a question as he was walking I was like hey you use my
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:04.760]  cash from team video in your TV report I use it I was like do you remember that
[02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:08.000]  he's like yeah yeah I was like you know I'm the guy who's in front of cash
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:12.000]  something he's like yeah I know you and I was like yeah you didn't accredit me but
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:15.040]  that's fine and I want to really know why don't you take the bill to Burke
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:19.600]  group seriously when the chief member even yon admitted that they created the
[02:46:19.600 --> 02:46:24.160]  euro and then and then he was looking at me turned away just and just you just
[02:46:24.160 --> 02:46:28.520]  totally ignored me and then security jumped on me and started putting their
[02:46:28.520 --> 02:46:34.120]  hands on me and how dare you talk to a god through the barricade how dare you
[02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:38.680]  when he used your footage and didn't give you credit try to talk to a god how
[02:46:38.680 --> 02:46:42.840]  and I don't get why they think it's elitist to be wimpy and not even a
[02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:47.120]  feminine because women aren't whims like this these metrosexual cowardly little
[02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:51.960]  and then as soon as you like go and act cowardly the system rolls out a red
[02:46:51.960 --> 02:46:57.080]  carpet I mean it's it's so I mean is there legends I mean my website's dwarf
[02:46:57.080 --> 02:47:01.240]  Glenn Beck our radio audience will be bigger than his on a current growth
[02:47:01.240 --> 02:47:05.080]  rate in about a year I mean he's he's literally we're bigger than Glenn Beck
[02:47:05.080 --> 02:47:09.040]  worldwide but the system tried to set him up as big he's a I mean the drudge
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:13.880]  reports probably 20 times in the metrics bigger than all of his sites combined
[02:47:13.880 --> 02:47:17.440]  you don't see drudge running around you know how he's the king of the earth I
[02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:22.120]  mean what is it Glenn Beck is any reps all our material and research off and
[02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:27.120]  never gives any of his credit it's ridiculous and that's why we need to
[02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:30.320]  talk to him but he's making sure nobody gets near him he's making sure nobody
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:34.680]  you gets very close to him at all I mean the way they're escorting him around
[02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:39.840]  they they they literally went all out no one had barely seen him he went on stage
[02:47:39.840 --> 02:47:43.760]  and he's all in these secret backyard areas I'm in the parking lot right now
[02:47:43.760 --> 02:47:46.800]  just trying to find them walking around to be honest with you because you know
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:50.760]  you know we have to be persistent here and the more persistent we are the more
[02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:55.560]  these people will what is this event that ran and get and get and get and get
[02:47:55.560 --> 02:48:03.600]  rich in and Becky are hanging out at this is the faith and freedom summit here
[02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:08.040]  in Washington DC and they're pretty much talking about push tax cut and
[02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:13.080]  Christianity on the most part here that's where all these leaders are coming
[02:48:13.080 --> 02:48:16.720]  in you know ours repeat I'm here as official press I'm here covering the
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:20.480]  event I'm here fun to talk to him and I'm just trying to be as persistent as I
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:24.640]  could be because you have to be I mean even Van Jones the first time I talk
[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:28.920]  to him he called security and the cops on me for asking him a question the second
[02:48:28.920 --> 02:48:33.200]  time he pushed me and started running away even though we chastened down the
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:40.840]  wicked play when none pursue questions I got one that can see I got one that
[02:48:40.840 --> 02:48:44.200]  can see what happened what happened a couple days ago that was amazing as I
[02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:49.000]  walked into a conference where Van Jones was speaking he started sweating he
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:53.240]  started getting nervous I again asked him a question during the Q&A I again
[02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:57.040]  walked up to him and he you know manned up and he actually had a
[02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:01.120]  conversation with me which was pretty amazing because you realize you know I'm
[02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:05.120]  not going to stop asking these questions I'm we can't we all have to do this we
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:09.320]  all have to be a part of this and it's just an amazing feeling being able to
[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:13.720]  speak truth to power it's one of the most incredible rushes you will ever get
[02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:17.760]  in your life and I highly recommend everybody take part take part either
[02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:21.840]  changing absolutely and find out how afraid they are what they're doing wrong
[02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:26.480]  how they absolutely just run from the camera like it's the end of the world
[02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:31.040]  Luke Radowski great job and we'll definitely get that clip of Rand I saw
[02:49:31.040 --> 02:49:34.040]  the part where he said investigate Bilderberg but I hadn't seen the full
[02:49:34.040 --> 02:49:39.400]  clip where Alex woke me up to Bilderberg and now I mean I know his staffers
[02:49:39.400 --> 02:49:42.200]  everybody tell him don't come on the show and oh they tell Ron Paul that I
[02:49:42.200 --> 02:49:46.280]  don't even care of you guys come on the show that's fine with me I think we
[02:49:46.280 --> 02:49:50.640]  might try to get them on just to see what they do but there's definitely been a
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:57.720]  big shift with those guys and it's very very sad but overall I mean why is Ron
[02:49:57.720 --> 02:50:01.680]  Paul been so quiet the last week and a half I mean everybody's talking about
[02:50:01.680 --> 02:50:07.200]  this Luke I mean it's very important and you know he has been quiet it is very
[02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:12.120]  worried from we don't know what's going on until you know I'm gonna stay here
[02:50:12.120 --> 02:50:15.360]  and see for a little bit I'm gonna keep trying to ask him more questions I mean
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:18.880]  I want to get to the bottom of everything and the only way to do it is yeah I
[02:50:18.880 --> 02:50:24.080]  would say hey act like a human don't become a plastic person why would you
[02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:28.840]  talk to me before and now you run in fear why do you want 10 security ran to
[02:50:28.840 --> 02:50:31.760]  put their hands on me because I'm just gonna walk five feet from me and ask
[02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:36.360]  you a question anyway doesn't scare me it doesn't intimidate me it's just sad
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:40.560]  that someone like Jay Rockefeller gives me more of an answer and more of a
[02:50:40.560 --> 02:50:44.840]  dialogue than Rand Paul he said you got a lot of nerve kid ought to give you a
[02:50:44.840 --> 02:50:49.400]  job whenever you said hey your family around the Nazis great job Luke we're

[02:54:00.600 --> 02:54:10.600]  I think we should all pray for Rand Paul to not fully turn to the neocons side
[02:54:10.600 --> 02:54:14.640]  because Ron Paul has done such incredible work. Rand has done incredible work
[02:54:14.640 --> 02:54:18.920]  there's definitely a big change happening there's definitely Romney
[02:54:18.920 --> 02:54:24.760]  worship going on and I guess people get blinded by their hate of Obama then I
[02:54:24.760 --> 02:54:31.080]  mean Mitt Romney is basically Obama he's not even Obama light but in the final
[02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:35.600]  equation this doesn't really matter we've spent a lot of time on Rand Paul and
[02:54:35.600 --> 02:54:42.760]  I'm kind of getting in out of my system so let's go to a phone call here let's
[02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:50.000]  talk to Baron in Alabama you're on the air go ahead thanks Alex before I get to
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.760]  the question I had for Lord Monk and I just wanted to respond to something you
[02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:57.400]  said earlier about not knowing what to call this new form of global government
[02:54:57.400 --> 02:55:01.760]  the you know because it's really unlike anything we've ever seen in history if I
[02:55:01.760 --> 02:55:08.600]  and I think it's a WTF accuracy in the sticker to my website WTF ROI.com
[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:12.720]  you know because that once you put all this stuff together that's really the
[02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:19.560]  only logical reaction that a thinking person can have well what it is I know
[02:55:19.560 --> 02:55:25.800]  it is it's a global corporate directed eugenics-based government that that is
[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:30.520]  just governed by absolute vicious behavior I appreciate your point sir
[02:55:30.520 --> 02:55:36.400]  let's talk to Doug and Santa Cruz listening on XM-166 now go ahead Doug
[02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:42.440]  you're on the air also your favorite KFCO station as well there with MZ I
[02:55:42.440 --> 02:55:47.680]  wanted to compliment you on the piece that I saw last night on this radioactive
[02:55:47.680 --> 02:55:53.080]  dump in Austin that you were reporting on that was I thought incredible well
[02:55:53.080 --> 02:55:56.920]  again we have the great-grandfather who was the head of all the maintenance at
[02:55:56.920 --> 02:56:01.040]  UT and operations telling his great-grandson that we know about the
[02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:04.640]  reactors we know that famously that's where they would hide stuff is outside
[02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:08.920]  town and so we're investigating it we're investigating the cave system right now
[02:56:08.920 --> 02:56:13.760]  but I think it's pretty darn credible the report is breaking massive nuclear
[02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:17.400]  secrets uncovered in Austin because the fact is they've had a rail gun blow up
[02:56:17.400 --> 02:56:22.760]  four days ago there's a bunch of other weirdness going on and I wanted to
[02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:27.200]  compliment you on that I called in before about the weaponization of water
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:32.400]  and Jeff Smith was on this was a actually it was July 5th but was the
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:39.160]  alexa in 1968 as a sophomore at Stanford I took a drive down to a place
[02:56:39.160 --> 02:56:43.200]  called Wickenburg Arizona which was a former Japanese relocation center that
[02:56:43.200 --> 02:56:47.520]  was in the Black Panther papers supposed to have been changed into a kind of a
[02:56:47.520 --> 02:56:51.520]  latter-day FEMA center but that's what it would have been then for political
[02:56:51.520 --> 02:56:55.080]  dissidents so these themes are not happening for the first time that's
[02:56:55.080 --> 02:57:00.120]  before you were born oh no there's always been a COG system the thing is
[02:57:00.120 --> 02:57:05.480]  they're expanding it massively I'd say it's ten times what it was in the 50s
[02:57:05.480 --> 02:57:08.920]  now I mean they've really built it up
[02:57:08.960 --> 02:57:13.000]  60s during the Vietnam War when there was political the dissidents like
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:17.800]  there is now because of outrageous behavior by our elected leaders you
[02:57:17.800 --> 02:57:21.160]  might be familiar with May Brussel and she was very prominent then I'm glad
[02:57:21.160 --> 02:57:24.040]  you said that because just because they built all this doesn't mean they're
[02:57:24.040 --> 02:57:27.960]  going to use it by it's a struggle between the evil track of history the
[02:57:27.960 --> 02:57:32.840]  good track of history everything we do it's a battle that's why they want you
[02:57:32.840 --> 02:57:37.640]  to think it's a foregone conclusion we could back all this off
[02:57:37.640 --> 02:57:45.560]  for you the psychosis psycho history but we need people like you now you're you're so I'm referring back to history I think is very important people were
[02:57:45.560 --> 02:57:49.960]  leveling up National Guard was leveling off guns with this political dissidents
[02:57:49.960 --> 02:57:56.760]  because of war so but it's very in 1981 Bank of America was paying me 23% on
[02:57:56.760 --> 02:58:01.720]  jumbo CDs because and that was with no national debt but what I'm going to end
[02:58:01.720 --> 02:58:07.360]  with Alex and compliment you is don't lose humor humor and tragedy are so
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:11.200]  closely entwined I have not heard hands down the pants pointy toes naked
