[00:38.520 --> 00:49.280]  and more Larry Nichols top Clinton insider dirty tricks operator the man behind the Clinton
[00:49.280 --> 00:55.880]  Chronicles is going to be joining us yet again he is battling cancer he doesn't want to talk
[00:55.880 --> 01:01.380]  about that some people got mad at me he talked about the cancer in the show before didn't tell
[01:01.380 --> 01:05.240]  me it was a secret and then when I started talking about it he changed his mind and didn't
[01:05.240 --> 01:11.600]  want to discuss but I did get what I said correct and we sent a camera crew up there a week and
[01:11.600 --> 01:17.920]  a half ago two weeks ago to Cary Jackson and Josh Owens to the little town he's living in in
[01:17.920 --> 01:24.880]  Arkansas and did a documentary piece that looks like something that it would air on HBO it's
[01:24.880 --> 01:33.360]  that good I don't know what we're gonna call it a Clinton hitman speaks out Clinton insider discusses
[01:33.360 --> 01:41.600]  the fall of the Clintons I mean I don't know what name you put on it Dixie Mafia insider
[01:41.600 --> 01:49.120]  exposes the Clintons and I see these emails I get and comments and it's a minority of people
[01:49.120 --> 01:52.320]  but I'll address your your point about Larry Nichols and I'm gonna address his day with
[01:52.320 --> 02:00.040]  him he's the prodigal son he was high level in his gubernatorial operation doing very well
[02:00.040 --> 02:08.080]  but he had a come to Jesus moment like Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus and couldn't be
[02:08.080 --> 02:14.440]  involved in killing kids that knew about the drug dealing which had been killed and couldn't be
[02:14.440 --> 02:20.480]  involved in shipping narcotics in and that happened while his daddy was dying of lung cancer and he
[02:20.480 --> 02:26.000]  thought about oh my god what happens if my dad when he basically gets to heaven can look down
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.160]  and and see the type of man I become running all sorts of black ops and Central and South America
[02:31.160 --> 02:38.240]  I mean Larry Nichols worked with the CIA you name it it's on record and he had a big house was
[02:38.240 --> 02:46.600]  making tons of money driving fancy cars do whatever he wanted to do as a big Clinton insider and he
[02:46.600 --> 02:50.880]  went against it all and lost everything he had and a bunch of people around him got killed over
[02:50.880 --> 02:58.680]  150 people arms legs cut off you name it it's like this MI6 agent that hacked the Clintons
[02:58.680 --> 03:06.840]  I'm gonna cover that with him a few years ago he was found dead tied up in a bag zipped inside
[03:06.840 --> 03:14.000]  a bag in his own bathtub and MI6 came in and said oh he committed suicide but the police did an
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.760]  investigation and said no he was murdered have you guys print me some news on that it was back
[03:18.760 --> 03:24.480]  of the news last Friday and Saturday I didn't cover it I was waiting for Nichols waiting for
[03:24.480 --> 03:30.960]  Nichols to be on that's who I really respect is people that have been dark have been evil have
[03:30.960 --> 03:37.440]  been involved in bad who then have the strength to get out of it it's easy to be milk toast and
[03:37.440 --> 03:42.160]  never do anything in your life and sit there and be a Pharisee and shake your finger at people all
[03:42.160 --> 03:54.320]  day but what's harder to do is to come back from hell it's a long way back from hell do you want
[03:54.320 --> 04:05.560]  to take a life do you want to cross that line because it's a long way back from hell you don't
[04:05.560 --> 04:12.400]  want to go that way most people can't come back from hell on the cross there's a murderer and
[04:12.400 --> 04:19.960]  a thief right there two men he says repent join me and today you can be in paradise to make the
[04:19.960 --> 04:25.280]  point that it's never too late of your heart's right and one of them scoffs the other says yes
[04:25.280 --> 04:33.080]  I want it Christ says well we'll be together today and there's the example right there so it shows
[04:33.080 --> 04:38.400]  the twisted mind of people out there that they don't get why we welcome somebody like Larry
[04:38.400 --> 04:44.520]  Nichols back into the light because he's the prodigal son think how much God loves those of us
[04:44.520 --> 04:51.200]  that have never been truly openly wicked all our hearts are wicked but but desperately wicked how
[04:51.200 --> 04:56.400]  much God loves those of us that are more virtuous from the beginning if God loves the prodigal son
[04:56.400 --> 05:03.200]  so much the lost sheep the vast majority of criminals don't buy guns from gun shows according to a
[05:03.200 --> 05:09.400]  survey by the University of Chicago crime lab in the survey of nearly 100 detainees at the cook
[05:09.400 --> 05:15.640]  county jail about 70% said they bought guns from social connections or corrupt cops and only a
[05:15.640 --> 05:21.680]  handful then purchased guns from licensed dealers at shops or shows some of the pathways people are
[05:21.680 --> 05:27.760]  concerned about don't seem so dominant said Harold Pollock co-director of the crime lab the survey
[05:27.760 --> 05:34.520]  also revealed that ar-15s and ak-47s often demonized as quote assault rifles by the media are
[05:34.520 --> 05:40.520]  unpopular among thugs and despite Chicago's strict gun control laws inmates were able to get a gun
[05:40.520 --> 05:46.480]  within six months of release police take the guns and put them back on the street one inmates said
[05:46.480 --> 05:52.280]  in other words gun control works at keeping criminals armed and their law-abiding victims

[08:09.200 --> 08:21.600]  we are on the march the empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:29.840 --> 08:38.240]  it's the juncture of radio and television coming together meeting americana hardcore
[08:38.240 --> 08:46.640]  naked promotion of libertarian free market ideas it's the Alex Jones show live monday through
[08:46.640 --> 08:53.040]  friday from 11 a.m to 2 p.m central time that's 12 noon to 3 p.m eastern that's 9 a.m to noon
[08:53.600 --> 09:03.520]  pacific 10 a.m to 1 p.m mountain or tony montana time thank you so much for joining us today larry
[09:03.520 --> 09:11.600]  nickels the big clinton insider will be joining us to talk mi6 spy found dead in bag in bath
[09:11.600 --> 09:19.200]  had hacked clinton data and the government ruled it was suicide he killed himself and then zipped
[09:19.200 --> 09:26.240]  himself up inside a duffel bag in what looks like a torture chamber and they admit he'd been being
[09:26.240 --> 09:34.400]  tortured by mi6 but it was only part of the training is this part of the cure
[09:36.960 --> 09:40.480]  and of course then the local police did an investigation they said no he was murdered
[09:42.400 --> 09:48.320]  and that's classic arkansas where your arms and legs are cut off and then you're found in a plastic
[09:48.320 --> 09:54.480]  bag in a trash dump and they say you committed suicide your arms your legs oh and your head
[09:54.480 --> 09:59.840]  too let me give everybody a newsflash you can't chop your head off when you don't have arms and legs
[09:59.840 --> 10:08.560]  and then you can't put yourself in a bag once that's happened now his arms and legs weren't cut off
[10:08.560 --> 10:15.680]  but it's still ridiculous zipping himself up inside a bag something houdini couldn't even do
[10:16.960 --> 10:21.760]  and they called people conspiracy theorists back when they criticized clinton for all those weird
[10:21.760 --> 10:28.720]  murders and they said that about this of course the magic term conspiracy theorists didn't convince
[10:28.720 --> 10:36.640]  the local police to come out and say that it wasn't foul play just like the local police in la
[10:36.640 --> 10:44.800]  said that sirhen sirhen didn't shoot robert f kennedy and was drugged oh but the fbi said he did
[10:44.800 --> 10:53.840]  it just a classic example speaking of that this is in the news today up on info wars dot com
[10:55.760 --> 11:00.800]  and it breaks down the fact that there are now muggings happening in the western world
[11:00.800 --> 11:09.680]  paris and other places with an amnesiac drug being given to men by basically women that come up and
[11:09.680 --> 11:13.920]  hit on them and then blow it in their face and then you can tell the man to go into his apartment
[11:13.920 --> 11:19.600]  into his condo into his hotel and give you everything he's got go to the bank and go in
[11:19.600 --> 11:25.200]  and check out every amount of money he's got same stuff you've heard about in columbia
[11:25.200 --> 11:30.480]  with this plant extract there's also puffer fish extract can do it it's called devil's breath
[11:33.680 --> 11:40.800]  and that ties in to the drugs that different governments and agencies and corporations have
[11:40.800 --> 11:47.200]  where you can put somebody on amnesics or similar drugs and then you can tell them go into that
[11:47.200 --> 11:51.280]  movie theater and shoot everybody and the person will say okay go and move it there and shoot
[11:51.280 --> 11:58.080]  everybody and then they'll do it and in so many cases these people are on these type of drugs
[11:58.640 --> 12:03.920]  and they classify the toxicology reports because the local police grab them they go this guy's
[12:03.920 --> 12:09.600]  whacked out take blood they take blood the feds swoop in and go we're gonna restrict that well
[12:09.600 --> 12:15.120]  who made you god we've got different jurisdictions to keep you in check just like the feds are supposed
[12:15.120 --> 12:20.560]  to keep the locals in check and the locals keep the feds in check that's why we have jurisdictions
[12:20.560 --> 12:26.560]  there's the headline mystery zombie drug used in paris muggings devil's breath zombie drug
[12:28.720 --> 12:34.080]  because when i get up here and i talk about mind control drugs people say oh there's no such thing
[12:34.080 --> 12:40.480]  yes there are my dad's a retired dentist and oral surgeon and i've talked to many other dentists as
[12:40.480 --> 12:44.800]  well you can give somebody healthy on that's not one tenth as strong as some of these drugs
[12:45.680 --> 12:49.520]  that's a standard drug they give you to pull your wisdom teeth you're not out you're not
[12:49.520 --> 12:56.400]  under you're there you can talk but you don't know what planet you're on and most people you can
[12:56.400 --> 13:04.560]  tell them to do anything you want when they're on it go jump off that cliff stick your hand in this
[13:04.560 --> 13:12.560]  garbage disposal and so when you've got 20 of the public on a similar class of psychotropics that
[13:12.560 --> 13:19.680]  put you in a trance dreamlike state people are highly suggestible and then television itself
[13:19.680 --> 13:26.560]  becomes a mass mind control machine we've all heard of suspended disbelief you walk in you see
[13:26.560 --> 13:30.960]  your kids watching television their eyes are wide open their mouths are wide open drool is dripping
[13:30.960 --> 13:36.240]  we've all seen that you walk into a movie theater a little bit late people are already in suspended
[13:36.240 --> 13:40.240]  disbelief or you get up go to the bathroom you come back in and everybody is just staring like
[13:40.240 --> 13:48.560]  zombies when i was a youth television was like that for me it's never like that anymore it's
[13:48.560 --> 13:57.280]  always cerebral it's always analysis it can be fun it can be interesting to see the propaganda
[13:57.280 --> 14:09.200]  the messages but i never suspend disbelief never and quite frankly it's torturous i uh look at
[14:09.200 --> 14:15.040]  people that get to live in la la land the matrix and i i actually envy you at some levels because
[14:15.040 --> 14:22.400]  my brain's always on unless i'm at the beach with the rhythmic waves the natural systems that god
[14:22.400 --> 14:31.680]  gave us to become entranced by nature a babbling brook just right the ocean with seagulls two or
[14:31.680 --> 14:40.160]  three beers i can sit back and just watch the people and the folks surfing and just trance out
[14:40.160 --> 14:47.120]  in two hours goes by and i feel like a giant weight is off my shoulders if i can just trance out
[14:47.120 --> 14:51.040]  a few times a year it's why i need to go to the beach more it's the only place
[14:53.200 --> 14:54.480]  i can go into a trance
[14:57.200 --> 15:01.760]  and it's why people go and they meditate at the beach or they meditate by a babbling brook
[15:01.760 --> 15:07.760]  because that's a natural thing we're supposed to do sometimes is go to the quiet place the most high
[15:07.760 --> 15:15.840]  that king david wrote about the problem is the globalist put us into an artificial quiet place
[15:15.840 --> 15:23.120]  of the most high and then hit us with zombies tearing people apart all the social messages all
[15:23.120 --> 15:28.320]  the demonization of the family all the murder all the death every major movie i see about cops now
[15:28.320 --> 15:32.560]  is about the cops with total surveillance grids to track everything you're doing in live time
[15:32.560 --> 15:39.120]  which is true it's illegal the average cop is doesn't have access to it yet but it's being phased in
[15:39.120 --> 15:43.520]  and handed out and we're all being acclimated and when you go see something like fashion furious
[15:43.520 --> 15:50.320]  the latest one or any of this it's just pure propaganda never seen a fashion furious but
[15:50.320 --> 15:56.800]  i like kurt russell so i went to see it and it was just terrible total false reality cars driving
[15:56.800 --> 16:03.120]  down five miles of cliffs and not blowing their tires just the most ridiculous mindless garbage
[16:03.120 --> 16:07.200]  a giant recruiting movie for the fbi homeland security and the cia
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.440]  with this eye of god software where they can track everything in real time with this system
[16:15.440 --> 16:18.720]  just just just utter comic book garbage
[16:18.720 --> 16:27.360]  gave me such a headache that i had to get out of it towards the end i just could not watch the full
[16:27.360 --> 16:38.720]  on assault on reality so it's natural and it's normal to want to get into a relaxed place
[16:40.800 --> 16:45.840]  but that's not what's happening when you go into a trance when you go into dream state when you go
[16:45.840 --> 16:51.920]  into the edge of not being conscious watching television or tv you are now defenseless having
[16:51.920 --> 17:01.040]  your subconscious savaged viciously well everybody gives their kids smartphones well
[17:01.040 --> 17:05.440]  everybody lets their kids watch two three hours of tv and look i get want to turn the tv on and
[17:05.440 --> 17:09.840]  you know go in the bedroom and watch television with your wife or your girlfriend or your husband
[17:09.840 --> 17:16.320]  and want to you know do something else want to have dinner in bed but your children are being
[17:16.320 --> 17:21.440]  murdered psychologically while they're i mean they're watching some old movie that's fine
[17:21.440 --> 17:26.640]  if they're you know seeing that that's different but when they're in there watching the modern
[17:26.640 --> 17:33.440]  culture that's designed to destroy attention spans when they're in there engrossed in that
[17:33.440 --> 17:38.080]  they are losing their consciousness and that's a fact you can look up screen time brain damaging
[17:38.080 --> 17:42.960]  children every major scientist who looks at it it's conclusive you can look at video games
[17:42.960 --> 17:48.720]  destroying gray matter in the brain and people say don't talk about my video games you say
[17:48.720 --> 17:52.720]  what you want you leave below hey i'm not attacking your video games you go ahead and do it if you
[17:52.720 --> 17:59.840]  want i'm telling you it's designed with the flicker rate and the software and all of it
[17:59.840 --> 18:08.480]  to suck you in it is a weapon system as Edward Bernays said it's a fact and it's destroying
[18:08.480 --> 18:14.320]  your potential now i didn't mean to get up on this whole talk about mind control we have huge news
[18:14.320 --> 18:18.640]  across the board i'm gonna open the phones up it's just to understand why we're in so much
[18:18.640 --> 18:24.480]  trouble you need to understand the average adult watches four hours of tv and about two hours to
[18:24.480 --> 18:31.040]  three hours of screen time that's four five six seven hours youth now are getting an average of
[18:31.040 --> 18:36.720]  six hours of tv or more the numbers vary and about three four hours of screen time we're talking
[18:36.720 --> 18:47.520]  about over eight nine hours this is devastating and the real world reading people watching
[18:47.520 --> 18:59.040]  listening to music hiking driving your car all of that will build your brain up joining a
[18:59.040 --> 19:06.240]  mma class joining a boxing class joining a bicycle club that's what humans do
[19:06.240 --> 19:16.320]  barbecuing with your neighbors remember what Steve Jobs said a couple years before he died they said so
[19:16.320 --> 19:21.440]  your ipads come out what are your young kids you know like to play on he said i don't even let them
[19:21.440 --> 19:28.560]  ever have it they can't touch one they're not allowed to watch television except very controlled
[19:28.560 --> 19:38.320]  situations it will destroy you don't you understand they have to metaphysically tell you
[19:38.320 --> 19:43.920]  and warn you before they do it to you now coming up stock market plunged today as we predicted
[19:43.920 --> 19:47.840]  not hard to point out that they can't prop it up forever the chinese have signal they're not
[19:47.840 --> 19:51.680]  going to prop theirs up anymore and that's why we could be getting ready to go on the way down
[19:51.680 --> 19:58.480]  now we've got huge isis news we've got huge abola news huge election news gun news
[19:59.680 --> 20:04.720]  that's disgusting what's that smell roll down your window before i pass out it's those nasty
[20:04.720 --> 20:09.520]  fish oil pills i've been taking why won't you just switch to neutral gold fish oil like i did
[20:09.520 --> 20:14.720]  it's fish oil what's the difference well my neutral gold fish oil is sourced and manufactured
[20:14.720 --> 20:19.920]  right here in the usa what's so special about that aren't they all are you kidding of course not

[24:54.880 --> 25:03.200]  and then i was going to break down the latest on the black lives matter groups calling for the
[25:03.200 --> 25:11.040]  killing of police with the new black panther party yesterday in texas uh just north of where the
[25:11.040 --> 25:16.400]  police officer was shot at a courthouse saying we're going to creep up on you in the dark
[25:16.400 --> 25:27.280]  well now report fox lake cop shot and killed police manhunt for two armed suspects and it
[25:27.280 --> 25:33.120]  appears to be another random shooting holding our breath will this end up being racially motivated
[25:34.800 --> 25:41.040]  illinois police officer shot prompting manhunt lake county police officials say a fox lake police
[25:41.040 --> 25:46.080]  officer has been shot and a manhunt is underway in the village for two armed male suspects
[25:49.440 --> 25:52.640]  though the officer's condition has been officially released mbc five chicago was
[25:52.640 --> 25:57.680]  reporting the law enforcement official has confirmed the officer's death let's hope that's not true
[25:58.320 --> 26:03.760]  there is a yellow crime scene tape around dipstick oil change on route 12 that's the new
[26:03.760 --> 26:09.120]  way to execute cops you just wait till they gas their vehicles about 30 police vehicles including
[26:09.120 --> 26:16.640]  some of military grade are on the scene at frontage and sight and roads
[26:20.320 --> 26:24.880]  other police vehicles are traveling rapidly around fox lake with officers stationed on most
[26:24.880 --> 26:38.320]  street corners and again when you have mtv msnbc cnn saying cops are racist and want to kill black
[26:38.320 --> 26:42.560]  people and showing some of these sad cases some of which are questionable some of which aren't
[26:43.520 --> 26:48.000]  and making it the number one issue in america for over a year and the justice department
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.960]  stirring up the trayvon martin situation and just in there to divert attention from black
[26:52.960 --> 26:59.120]  unemployment doubling under obama it is meant cold-bloodedly to get black people and white people
[26:59.120 --> 27:05.520]  at each other's throats and it's not been working with the general public with with just americans
[27:05.520 --> 27:11.520]  of all colors but it is working with mentally ill people and they're now saying two years ago three
[27:11.520 --> 27:19.040]  years ago the shooter in houston of darin goforth the dead officer he shot 15 times in the back
[27:20.240 --> 27:26.960]  five of them in the head basically dead instantly he'd been declared mentally ill and had been in
[27:26.960 --> 27:36.800]  a mental institution so there you go i mean i could take one look at him and tell you he's
[27:36.800 --> 27:42.640]  completely out of his mind and so is the shooter up there in charleston these are mentally ill people
[27:43.200 --> 27:48.240]  and when the media hypes up that cops are the ultimate bad and cops are the reason for all
[27:48.240 --> 27:52.400]  the problems in the world you're not going to have suicide by cop anymore you're not going to have
[27:52.400 --> 27:57.920]  folks copycat and jumping off bridges like they used to in the 20s 30s 40s 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s
[27:57.920 --> 28:05.520]  2000s the new thing is going to be go out and shoot a cop gassing up the car getting oil change
[28:08.960 --> 28:10.080]  highly suggestible
[28:13.760 --> 28:19.040]  and i guarantee you if this guy was in a mental institution and they released him i guarantee
[28:19.040 --> 28:24.800]  you and they'll hide this forever but it'll come out maybe a six months a year maybe this week i don't
[28:24.800 --> 28:34.000]  know i'll guarantee you the shooter in harris county in south texas was on psychotropic drugs
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.680]  or had just gone off of them because going off of them will whack you out too if you go off of them
[28:37.680 --> 28:43.840]  quickly and notice that we're not hearing about it what his psychiatric medications were but he
[28:43.840 --> 28:50.080]  was in a mental institution in texas for violent people for one year
[28:54.000 --> 29:00.640]  abc news ap latest on texas deputy lawyer says man had mental illness had been in a mental
[29:00.640 --> 29:05.920]  institution they don't let you out of those things unless you agree to be drug and then you got to go
[29:05.920 --> 29:12.560]  in he was under psychiatric evaluation he had to go in once a month to get checked i bet all the tea
[29:12.560 --> 29:19.760]  in china that he was on drugs which on the insert say they make you do it and then you get highly
[29:19.760 --> 29:27.760]  suggestible people seeing footage of bad cops doing bad things they then project that on to the
[29:27.760 --> 29:33.680]  group and the shooting start you want to place your bets on whether this is another black lives
[29:33.680 --> 29:42.160]  matter new black panther party promoted slime fest in illinois well the media will do its best to
[29:42.160 --> 29:48.000]  cover it up we'll only learn if the police come out and tell us we'll be back stay with us we're
[29:48.000 --> 29:54.400]  on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[33:16.080 --> 33:26.240]  Sandra Bland remember about a month and a half ago she's in southeast texas gets pulled over by
[33:26.240 --> 33:31.920]  super nice state police deputy i mean i run into some real jerks from the dps some of them are real
[33:31.920 --> 33:38.960]  nice but i've run into some real jerks before and this guy was super nice she starts flipping out
[33:38.960 --> 33:46.960]  throwing fits he goes to hand cover she freaks out and then it turns out she'd been putting out
[33:46.960 --> 33:52.800]  videos making statements that she was going to commit suicide she looked completely depressed
[33:52.800 --> 33:57.920]  looked in my opinion mentally ill she looked whacked out of her mind it's like you look at
[33:57.920 --> 34:02.800]  charlie manson and you look crazy in a killer way she didn't look like a killer she just looked
[34:02.800 --> 34:06.960]  completely depressed completely freaked out and that's what she said so she had a new life
[34:06.960 --> 34:10.160]  she thought leaving illinois coming back to texas
[34:11.920 --> 34:15.600]  cop pulls her over he's going to give her a warning
[34:19.040 --> 34:22.080]  and when he says okay i'm going to let you go with a warning she blows up at him
[34:24.160 --> 34:27.440]  and he's like excuse me i mean the 14 minute tapes on info wars dot com
[34:28.000 --> 34:33.520]  he's like look you got your warning i'm out of here and she just bows up gets all upset
[34:33.520 --> 34:37.520]  that because she wanted to be a martyr wanted to be a victim
[34:38.880 --> 34:42.880]  now are there cases where crazy cops shoot innocent people in the back absolutely
[34:43.680 --> 34:46.320]  and the cops that you've seen doing that are getting indicted
[34:52.160 --> 34:58.800]  and out of all of this attention to the police they're going to use this to fully come in
[34:58.800 --> 35:02.800]  and take over the departments and turn them into politically correct globalist
[35:02.800 --> 35:05.040]  that's what all this pressure on the police is about
[35:07.680 --> 35:14.400]  and now they've named a parkway a major road texas city names road after sandra bland
[35:15.440 --> 35:22.000]  it's like they want to have a statue downtown to leslie the transvestite and i'm not against quote
[35:23.280 --> 35:29.280]  transvestites and people i really it's not on my radar screen but if you knew leslie
[35:29.280 --> 35:38.400]  he was one of the most disgusting horrible creatures he made golem look like an angel
[35:39.440 --> 35:42.400]  and if anybody from the leslie camp ever attacks me i'll unload
[35:43.040 --> 35:48.160]  because my office for five years was next door to his house he was not homeless
[35:49.600 --> 35:56.160]  and we moved in part to get away from it and if we have new listeners they're like or people
[35:56.160 --> 36:00.480]  from not from austin they're like who is leslie cochran well just be glad you didn't know
[36:03.120 --> 36:10.000]  because he was i don't want to even get into it i don't even want to get into it
[36:12.640 --> 36:17.600]  i don't know why i'm digressing off into this but they want to make a big spat statue downtown to him
[36:17.600 --> 36:26.880]  and it's the same thing with sandra bland i don't think she was a disgusting person like him
[36:28.560 --> 36:31.840]  fine people want me to tell you what was going on no i'm not going to do it i mean
[36:31.840 --> 36:35.680]  i'm not going to speak ill of the dead he was a very sad person we pray for his soul
[36:35.680 --> 36:41.760]  there in fact i do apologize i do is actually a very sad person but you don't celebrate it as
[36:41.760 --> 36:46.240]  if it's god and say it's the most beautiful thing on earth when it was one of the most
[36:46.240 --> 36:48.480]  saddening creatures i've ever seen
[36:53.440 --> 36:58.240]  i bet it's safe to say few people know leslie cochran as good as i did and my staff did that
[36:58.240 --> 37:01.680]  were there for five years rob jackson had to deal with him every day
[37:07.120 --> 37:13.120]  ought to call him in here you can tell you some stories but i digress the celebration of this lady
[37:13.120 --> 37:17.200]  when the mo fits that she went in there and hung herself in the jail cell
[37:19.520 --> 37:22.240]  now she may not have i give it a 10 chance
[37:26.480 --> 37:34.800]  but now you've got the new black panther party a few weeks ago chanting off the pigs off the pigs
[37:34.800 --> 37:39.280]  pigs in a blanket fry the pigs give the pigs wings we're gonna play some of that there's the new
[37:39.280 --> 37:46.720]  video out at bright mart today armed black panthers to texas cops yesterday we will start creeping
[37:46.720 --> 37:52.800]  up on you in the darkness you think we're not pissed about sandra bland
[37:55.440 --> 38:01.360]  that's a quote and i'm all for people to have the right to arm march that's great the differences
[38:01.360 --> 38:07.360]  from the black new black panther party marches they have their m16s in their hands basically
[38:07.360 --> 38:12.880]  pointing them around at people and that is is a dangerous display of a firearm that is a rude
[38:12.880 --> 38:19.280]  display that is brandishing a firearm with an intent to menace and believe me if a tea party
[38:19.280 --> 38:24.640]  group acted like this we'd be attacked we'd be arrested we'd be shot if a motorcycle gang acted
[38:24.640 --> 38:30.400]  halfway like this it'd be attacked why is the new black panther party allowed to go around as an
[38:30.400 --> 38:36.000]  organized armed group promoting the killing of peace officers because their white house and
[38:36.000 --> 38:41.040]  foundation controlled that's come out and they got a larger mission i'm gonna break down in a moment
[38:41.760 --> 38:46.800]  but here is the clip in texas there's so many of these clips this is a short one because of the
[38:46.800 --> 39:10.800]  profanities saying basically off the cops which means kill the cops here it is
[39:17.120 --> 39:18.800]  in my community
[39:29.920 --> 39:32.960]  now let me explain what's happening i know everybody basically gets what's happening
[39:32.960 --> 39:36.960]  some of you probably know more than i do but this is socio manipulation this is
[39:36.960 --> 39:41.600]  social engineering by the biggest richest people in the world to destroy this country
[39:41.600 --> 39:48.720]  can you imagine the average poor hard-working good christian black person that's the salt of the
[39:48.720 --> 39:54.160]  earth that's had drugs shipped into the communities that's had their children prepared and prep for
[39:54.160 --> 40:00.560]  prison that's had summoner redstone and mtv put out and promote gangster rap from nowhere
[40:01.200 --> 40:04.000]  to poison black and then the rest of the culture of the world
[40:04.000 --> 40:13.360]  can you imagine after everything now having a white house run black lives matter organizations
[40:14.160 --> 40:19.440]  and the new black panther party running around saying pigs in a blanket kill the pigs fry the
[40:19.440 --> 40:27.680]  pigs on and on and on from houston texas to minneapolis st paul minnesota to new york city
[40:27.680 --> 40:35.520]  i mean i'll be honest i couldn't have gone with jacari and joe biggs up to ferguson
[40:35.520 --> 40:39.680]  when most of the people were demonstrating against legitimate problems with the police
[40:39.680 --> 40:44.080]  there were some issues they even shot our people with rubber bullets for no reason everything else
[40:45.920 --> 40:49.840]  but then groups of thugs would just show up and start fights with jacari mainly in bigs
[40:49.840 --> 40:56.640]  bigs getting in their face and of course jacarian bigs didn't back down
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.960]  and jacari's a pretty big guy and you know bigs isn't a whim and they were just basically ready to
[41:02.960 --> 41:07.120]  throw down and then the thugs back down but
[41:10.160 --> 41:14.000]  you've got a bunch of criminals basically that are using this as a political smoke screen
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.080]  to do whatever they want and when it all ends it's going to discredit any legitimate
[41:18.080 --> 41:23.760]  movement urban movement for a renewal urban movement for unity urban movement whether it's
[41:23.760 --> 41:33.120]  black or whatever it is to fix police departments it's going to legitimize bad cops getting away
[41:33.120 --> 41:42.080]  with doing really bad things and i i mean i told you this eight nine months ago and i got calls
[41:42.080 --> 41:45.920]  from a couple different affiliates i'm not going to name them saying listen you can say
[41:45.920 --> 41:51.120]  whatever you want you can attack obama you can attack bainer you can talk about the cia drug
[41:51.120 --> 41:55.280]  dealing you can say whatever you want basically the phone calls are the same but we have the
[41:55.280 --> 41:59.600]  chamber of commerce and stuff breathing down our neck the fact that you're mentioning this town and
[41:59.600 --> 42:06.560]  that town has criminals coming up to people getting in their face we don't want that news out that's
[42:06.560 --> 42:11.360]  part of the political correctness of not wanting to admit people are getting mugged and thugged
[42:11.360 --> 42:15.600]  and that it's racially based that's the new excuse the old days a group of guys black or
[42:15.600 --> 42:21.760]  white would get together and they'd go to a local gay bar and they would roll and beat
[42:21.760 --> 42:25.600]  up and rob the gay guys coming out figuring you know they weren't tough guys or whatever at least
[42:25.600 --> 42:31.200]  the stereotype and they'd beat them up and rob them they'd mug them but it was okay because
[42:31.200 --> 42:35.360]  you know those guys didn't normally mug people they only mugged them because they were gay well
[42:35.360 --> 42:41.920]  that's terrible well the new thing is mugging white people and i know that all over downtown
[42:41.920 --> 42:46.240]  austin it's been happening a lot i know a bunch of people hispanic and white that have been mugged
[42:47.200 --> 42:53.440]  and then not once not twice but three times the last year i was on east seventh east four you know
[42:53.440 --> 42:58.720]  places great restaurants best restaurants in austin it's gentrified over there a lot of
[42:58.720 --> 43:04.400]  monies come in as good a restaurant you'll find a new york city and i'm not a push over guy
[43:04.400 --> 43:12.640]  and and but i mean not once not twice but three times i'm talking black guys it probably weighed
[43:12.640 --> 43:20.320]  275 pounds each time arms that big around you're getting in your car and somebody's like i really
[43:20.320 --> 43:25.120]  need some money that's all i'm telling you i hope somebody gives it to me i got big problems and i'd
[43:25.120 --> 43:29.440]  get in a fighting stance i'm gonna listen i don't want any trouble you better find somebody easier
[43:30.240 --> 43:34.080]  they say listen all i want some money and nothing's gonna happen i'm not saying you gotta
[43:34.080 --> 43:41.120]  give me money but somebody better give me some money i'm talking roided up crazy looking people
[43:44.720 --> 43:48.400]  and in one of the cases because i don't always carry long as my kids are in the car sometimes
[43:49.120 --> 43:53.360]  i jumped out of the seat and about then the guy ran off he figured out what he was about to
[43:53.360 --> 43:58.480]  happen but i mean i didn't even call the cops because they won't do anything folks it's a
[43:58.480 --> 44:05.760]  shakedown just like on the new york subway that's a really nice watch
[44:07.360 --> 44:11.280]  and you're like yeah thank you my grandfather gave it to me yeah well i'd really like it
[44:12.160 --> 44:16.960]  people sit on both sides of me this is the same thing that goes on and then no one's supposed
[44:16.960 --> 44:22.640]  to talk about it no one's supposed to deal with it and then the chamber of commerce puts pressure
[44:22.640 --> 44:28.320]  on radio stations that carry this show in cities because they don't want that news out folks
[44:28.320 --> 44:37.920]  that's what's going on that's what's happening that's what's unfolding and that's what the media
[44:37.920 --> 44:43.920]  has pushed as normal and okay and acceptable and it's not
[44:46.560 --> 44:51.520]  and so i've never gone and got my kids still carry i've been too busy but you know what i'm
[44:51.520 --> 44:54.960]  going to have to take some days off or something and i'm going to go over to cargill's and take it
[44:54.960 --> 45:04.400]  because it is expanding it is getting bad and it is sad and i could officially tell you basically a
[45:04.400 --> 45:09.120]  race war has already been started by the white house in this country and it's despicable and it's
[45:09.120 --> 45:15.360]  wrong and i literally prayed last night that the crazy white supremacist some of them are veterans
[45:15.360 --> 45:21.440]  and people because i'm going to tell you folks i've studied history and when white people go crazy
[45:21.440 --> 45:29.040]  i mean one buck toothed kid killed nine people it's going to be bad i and the adl and southern
[45:29.040 --> 45:33.680]  poverty law center and msnbc and all these groups they know what they're doing they're winding up
[45:33.680 --> 45:38.720]  black people to go out and attack white people knowing unstable white supremacists are going to
[45:38.720 --> 45:45.840]  just go in a church or or a urban black mall or something and my god it's going to be bad i mean
[45:47.520 --> 45:51.200]  just we got to pray this stops right now because then they're going to come after everybody's
[45:51.200 --> 45:56.080]  guns i can just see the plan they're going to have reconciliation national committees and
[45:56.080 --> 45:59.920]  it'll we've all to be politically correct now we've all got to submit to whatever the government
[45:59.920 --> 46:04.320]  says and use the language the government says we've got to have you know reparations or whatever
[46:04.320 --> 46:10.320]  it won't be reparations it'll be more tiny handouts just to federalize the black and other poor
[46:10.320 --> 46:16.480]  communities to further screw everybody over and break up their families it is such a diabolical plan
[46:16.480 --> 46:20.880]  but i had a responsibility to go on austin radio
[46:24.560 --> 46:28.720]  and i was taking off austin radio and i wasn't told exactly why but i was told that the grapevine
[46:29.360 --> 46:34.080]  that it was because i was didn't matter how high my ratings were didn't didn't matter and this is
[46:34.080 --> 46:42.640]  that before i'm not going to shut up because of that and other stations but we gain more stations
[46:42.640 --> 46:49.760]  for stations we lose and we have an austin affiliate the point is is that this is going on and
[46:49.760 --> 46:54.160]  sweeping it under the rug isn't going to hide it you know the fact that cops are getting shot
[46:54.720 --> 46:59.200]  and the fact that a guy went in and shot a reporter and a cameraman because they were white
[46:59.200 --> 47:04.640]  and the media wouldn't even say it was racially motivated yes it is and it's wrong and it's got
[47:04.640 --> 47:16.720]  to be stopped and we need communities to come together the same way we saw and charleston
[47:16.720 --> 47:22.480]  when we sent jacari jackson up there coming together and saying we're as a community black
[47:22.480 --> 47:26.160]  white doesn't matter we're decrying this and we're against this and we're sorry for what happened
[47:26.880 --> 47:32.800]  so we need to see black people come out and i know they are saying it but in any form you can
[47:32.800 --> 47:38.160]  and say this is wrong we don't appreciate this we don't support this and when you hear racist people
[47:38.160 --> 47:43.760]  buying into rachel madow and msnbc and mtv listen some of the redstone and rachel madow
[47:43.760 --> 47:50.320]  want to abort your babies they want you drugged out in the cia run inner cities they want you on
[47:50.320 --> 47:56.000]  the democratic party plantation they are your enemy the liberty movement is your friend and
[47:56.000 --> 48:03.920]  wants to empower you and wants to see you be a leader and we want to elect tea party black leaders
[48:03.920 --> 48:07.680]  because there's some of the most articulate best people out there like that sheriff chicari and
[48:07.680 --> 48:14.240]  bigs had on yesterday that former deputy police officer marine running for sheriff down in harris
[48:14.240 --> 48:22.480]  county that's the kind of sheriff you need a constitutionalist carl pitman i want to get
[48:22.480 --> 48:29.040]  him back on the show next week on this show that's the kind of people we need that are patriots
[48:29.680 --> 48:35.680]  endorsed by our pio endorsed by richard mac and not because they're black but because they're
[48:35.680 --> 48:43.360]  patriots but also these are cities that are half black we do need to have patriot black leaders
[48:43.360 --> 48:53.520]  not leaders like al sharpton pushing division and evil but promoting freedom and prosperity
[48:54.480 --> 48:58.560]  that's what we need that's what needs to happen that's what needs to be promoted and we need to
[48:58.560 --> 49:05.360]  recognize what sheriff clark is saying of milwaukee and others this is the white house
[49:05.360 --> 49:14.160]  trying to start a race war starting a war on police to intimidate the police in demanding
[49:14.160 --> 49:18.320]  over to the globalist because it's not the feds keep saying the feds are taking over the feds
[49:18.320 --> 49:22.720]  have been captured and now they're going to come in and say we'll take the heat off we'll have black
[49:22.720 --> 49:28.080]  lives matter back off but you first have to do whatever we say you do that this purge is never
[49:28.080 --> 49:33.360]  going to end don't be stupid and i know some of you are not stupid and i don't mean that condescendingly
[49:33.360 --> 49:38.320]  the general public's pretty dumb and they draw cops from that same pool of people and i see plenty
[49:38.320 --> 49:43.520]  of arrogant power tripping cops they can be black they can be white they can be hispanic you can tell
[49:43.520 --> 49:49.600]  a thug cop looking at them versus a peace officer and they're a big problem and the system wants to
[49:49.600 --> 49:57.440]  recruit people like that to ruin your ancient and honorable order your your your fraternal system
[49:57.440 --> 50:03.280]  you're being crapped all over by the new world order so you can be scapegoated
[50:04.240 --> 50:07.760]  but i'm not going to blame you for having the crap all over you i'm going to look at the new
[50:07.760 --> 50:13.040]  world order that's the one doing it the one putting it all over you but you've got to learn not to
[50:13.040 --> 50:17.760]  defend the garbage you got to get it out of your midst and you've got to realize you are under
[50:17.760 --> 50:24.480]  scientific attack because once you fall and law and order falls during the destabilization
[50:24.480 --> 50:29.360]  they're gonna bring martial law in and they're gonna take the guns and they're gonna start
[50:29.360 --> 50:34.080]  arresting the patriots and then they're gonna have you come after the patriots and the patriots
[50:34.080 --> 50:40.640]  are gonna have to fight back and that's what's really gonna wipe the police out you think
[50:41.200 --> 50:48.160]  some mentally ill people shooting a few cops is anything compared to when they start a civil
[50:48.160 --> 50:53.520]  war and people have to defend themselves make the decision now police and military which i know you're
[50:53.520 --> 51:00.400]  doing not to serve the globalist but to defend the republic choose wisely so i say to market lunch
[51:00.400 --> 51:04.400]  look you know i keep hearing from the government that you know they're worried someday isis may
[51:04.400 --> 51:11.280]  get here and i go duck or garland texas mohammed cartoon shooting isis is already here i'm not

[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:23.360]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones well undoubtedly
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:28.320]  somebody flip the light switch the last two years it's called the white house the ford foundation
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:36.400]  msnbc media matters all the usual camp following of rats to make every problem in the world white
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:41.360]  people and then his unemployment doubles in the black community worse than every other group under
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:46.080]  obama uh as the drugs get shipped into their communities as things unravel as the family
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:53.680]  collapses as we go into serious recession slash depression folks are now taking out their rage
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:59.600]  on white people and the police and there are serious problems with the police obviously
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:06.480]  but racial attacks on whites beating shootings killings the media has tried its best to cover
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:13.360]  this up just can't do it anymore not one it's basically a daily basis now or every two days a
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:18.880]  reporter a cameraman a sheriff's deputy a police officer in illinois we don't know what this is
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:23.920]  yet but it looks like an execution again at getting his oil change at the gas pump at the gas station
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.160]  and the police are finally getting it right going this is a war on police this is racially
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:41.840]  motivated as well but why would msnbc and cnn and the white house and the ford foundation do this
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:48.880]  because it's a plan to destabilize the country the rest of the story is the problem yeah it's
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:54.480]  bad to have cops get killed and it's starting to become a real epidemic but still more cops get
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:59.280]  killed in car accidents i'm not saying any of it's good it's terrible but it shows the mind
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:05.360]  control taking place through the controlled media and it shows you if you don't respond through your
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:10.320]  unions and through the media and really get aggressive like sheriff clark has done and call
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:19.440]  it what it is a premeditated program we can't stop it you've got to address the diabolical plan if
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:24.480]  you're going to beat it and i know you think the public isn't ready to hear this stuff it doesn't
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:29.440]  matter facts or facts the only way to counter a criminal conspiracy of this magnitude is to go
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.840]  up against it and you got to decide you're going to serve the new world order you're going to be
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:39.120]  corrupt you're going to have a leg in both world you can't do that you want to be with a dishonorable
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:46.080]  narcotics trafficking child trafficking snuff filmmaking new world order mega banks that are
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:51.360]  running isis and he's stabilizing the world and overthrowing ukraine and george soros the same people
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:56.880]  or are you going to stand up and fight for this country because they're getting ready for this
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:02.240]  to destroy the economy here's the thing you get prosperity and security by doing the right thing
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:08.800]  but you got to have the courage to do it up front so i got loaded phone lines but after i take this
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:14.240]  bank of callers every other caller that calls in after this john i want to see if it's an active duty
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:20.400]  police officer or a retired police officer or a wife or husband of a police officer to hear what the
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:26.560]  climate's like what you're thinking what's going on but i've talked to awesome police they're fully
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:33.520]  aware of the muggings the racially based attacks and it's just wrong that the media covers this up
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:42.960]  kevin in florida you're on the air go ahead thank you i just wanted to get your thoughts
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:49.120]  how many more of these ridiculous government staged shootings whether it be white on black
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:54.400]  or black on white is it going to take for the sheep that are living in this country to just
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:59.120]  roll over and give up their guns just i have a sad feeling that's that's really the end game
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.960]  because i feel like the people who are totally ignorant and believe anything and everything
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:10.720]  that mtv and cbs and all those other mainstream propaganda stations tell them true farley out
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:16.720]  way the people who are informed um and i'm just trying to figure out what what you feel about that
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:21.040]  all right it's a great question i'm going to come back from the break and try to answer that
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:26.800]  but it's a paradox the globalists are not targeting people they know we're awake
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:30.080]  they're counting on dumbing down the new generations and knowing they'll buy anything they
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:34.160]  tell them including two plus two equals five you know when the white house came out and said two
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:39.280]  plus two equals five folks and that's ridiculous to the young people that buy the kool-aid they
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:43.840]  believe that i mean they believe political correctness they believe i just said white house kool-aid
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:48.080]  because i'm racist that's some code word for black people like a kool-aid no it's jim jones
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:53.200]  and the kool-aid but cyanide in it that's what kool-aid means so see the young people can't even
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:57.440]  communicate because they're all programmed for political correctness going after phantoms
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:03.920]  the vast majority of criminals don't buy guns from gun shows according to a survey by the
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:10.240]  university of chicago crime lab in the survey of nearly 100 detainees at the cook county jail
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:16.000]  about 70% said they bought guns from social connections or corrupt cops and only a handful
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.360]  then purchased guns from licensed dealers at shops or shows some of the pathways people
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:27.040]  are concerned about don't seem so dominant said herald pollock co-director of the crime lab
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:33.680]  the survey also revealed that ar-15s and ak-47s often demonized as quote assault rifles by the
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:39.840]  media are unpopular among thugs and despite chicago's strict gun control laws inmates were able to
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:45.360]  get a gun within six months of release police take the guns and put them back on the street
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:51.040]  one inmate said in other words gun control works at keeping criminals armed and their
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:59.280]  law-abiding victims disarmed you can find more reports on info wars dot com when cells become

[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:06.800]  ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:14.880]  here's the headline boiling down the latest that we know another cop executed in illinois
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:24.160]  will it be linked to black lives matter and other white house run racist groups this is in fox lake
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:30.640]  and i was just looking at fox news they've got the helicopters launching with the paramilitary
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:38.000]  police hanging out the windows with their 308 reaper style assault rifles
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:45.840]  and it looks like the same mo as harris county houston with the execution friday
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:51.680]  and if this continues to be given top coverage it's going to cause a domino effect
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:09:00.000]  and that's one thing that police were saying last week when the black racist obama supporter
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.480]  shot the white reporter and the white cameraman the police started to get it and said we need to
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:09.120]  stop reporting on this it's going to cause a domino effect and again i've talked about this
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:15.280]  a lot the copycat effect where for 60 70 years when somebody would go jump off the impar states
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:19.680]  building every few months they would station police there for two or three days because
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:24.160]  suddenly five or six people a day would show up trying to jump off they finally just basically
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:30.000]  put fences up where you can't jump when somebody jumps off the golden gate suddenly a bunch people
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.920]  show up and the truth is you can't stop people from killing themselves well now the media is
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:42.080]  promoted don't just kill yourself go kill someone of another race if you're white go kill black
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:47.680]  people if you're black go kill white people it is the just the most idiotic mindlessness as if
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:54.240]  you're going to get ahead if you're white if you go shoot nine black people or as if you're
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.840]  going to get ahead if you're black if you go shoot some cop in the back of the head what you're
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.960]  going to get is 20 years on death row before you get executed but it turns out the shooter was in a
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:08.000]  mental institution for a year and was under psychiatric care for the last three years since
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.120]  he got out guaranteed he's on drugs but they're one of the biggest sponsors in media so you'll
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:22.000]  never hear it until later you will never hear i mean we know the shooter up in uh virginia had
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.160]  been seeing psychologists but we don't know they were on drugs well now we know this guy was in a
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:34.160]  mental institution and lived with mommy and he sat there and guaranteed watched msnbc guaranteed
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:39.520]  got fed all this and just got mad got a gun and went out saw a cop and killed him
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:47.840]  and all that's going to do is push the police state culture
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:53.760]  that's then going to be flipped on the tea party and the liberty movement
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:59.840]  in fact he was declared mentally incompetent in 2012
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:08.080]  it's always a mentally ill person or it's gangbanger people on drugs out of their mind remember
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:14.880]  the crackhead guy that tortured the two white 15 16 year olds of death last year in um
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:21.200]  detroit tor took their money and then tortured him to death wasn't enough to just kill him
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:26.560]  tortured him to death in a vacant house and then when he got sentenced he said black lives matter
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:31.520]  would you like to apologize for what you done before sentencing yeah i'd like to apologize
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:37.520]  for all the black people getting killed by white people as if killing two snot nosed
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:46.480]  crackhead white people that i guarantee you worship nwa and you that watch mtv and see you as their
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:51.840]  daddy why would their daddy kill them as they squealed and begged
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:00.160]  to them that's a male father figure that was forged by the cia and the weaponized media
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:05.840]  the gangster rap to be the father figure in the ghetto so the young kids would get into drugs so
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:12.880]  they could be put in prison now does the average cop involved in this absolutely not are they
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:18.320]  compartmentalized absolutely do we need to reach out to them and try to wake them up absolutely
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:23.360]  but yes there is a conspiracy against everybody in this country
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:31.440]  and because black people were oppressed and downtrodden undoubtedly they were always the beta
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:43.920]  test group but believe this and know it in the final equation it's targeting upper middle class
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:49.280]  white people and if the upper middle class on average was black they'd be targeting you too
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:55.280]  the elite doesn't want any independent wealth period period
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:00.400]  what did the founder of the Rockefeller dynasty say
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:08.160]  he said competition is a sin he said it in the new york times i'm a monopoly man
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:17.680]  and the Rockefellers almost single-handedly funded hitler with ibm
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.480]  and then they set hitler up in his peace treaty with england
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:29.280]  and they locked up the vise furor root off s and they controlled our media and you never knew
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:33.360]  hitler was promised all the europe and the king of england was promised to be the king of europe
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:39.520]  with a european union and three super blocks financed by the Rockefellers and they were going
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:43.920]  to put in fascist rule here in the united states they were going to ship blacks back to africa
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:49.680]  and everything else and prescott bush was going to head up the banking operation and then they
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:56.000]  betrayed all the nazis and hung them out to dry just remember how hardcore the global star next time
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.760]  remember how diabolical and serious they are
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.520]  oh they got their e you it just didn't belong to germany or hitler
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.160]  and it's all in the congressional hearings of the cormac dickstein committee
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:20.800]  it's all on the record is what's incredible i read this stuff in mainline history books pieces of it
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:31.360]  in rise and fall the third right shire cheer and hinds hobel order the death said and the
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:36.800]  mind of that off hitler the secret wartime report declassified in 1974 the year i was born i read
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:42.400]  that and i was like 13 years old and i guess the reason i know how stuff works is i read books by
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:48.800]  alexander solzhenitsyn i read books by zbigniew brzezinski and david rockefeller i read books by
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:58.400]  adolf hitler he wrote two i read books by the good guys and the bad guys and the average pseudo
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:03.520]  intellectual politico just knows how to bamboozle people and run scams and hobnob into groups to
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:07.840]  be part of the gravy train they don't even know how the whole show works but up at the very very top
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:15.360]  up at the rothschild rockefeller sacks coberg gotha transylvanian royal bloodline level they
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:20.480]  know exactly what they're doing and it's why their family's been in control of europe for a thousand
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:31.440]  years because they got the right stuff they got the dragon blood they are the grand dragons
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:36.640]  they are the grand wizards what do you think albert pike was telling you when he named the
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:42.800]  kuklux klan under those designations you know those are occult illuminati designations that predated
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:51.440]  the kuklux klan and just like hitler was a spinoff of the illuminati the kuklux klan was a spinoff
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:56.720]  of the illuminati and the new black panthers and the ford foundation and all these groups work to
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:03.440]  create the dialectic and to create the war and to lead us into war and collapse against each other
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:10.720]  it is despicable after i take a round of calls if police officers can get in i didn't think of this
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:19.280]  at first or active duty um military wants to comment there's a brigade homeland or the wives
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:22.960]  or husbands of police officers what do you think about this climate as soon as you hear one of
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:30.720]  these callers hang up 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 i'm gonna try to move through your calls quickly
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:34.800]  so just make your point then i'm gonna get into the stock market and closure today the europe
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:40.720]  collapsing with the immigrant waves the military being called out uh major trains and and and
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:46.720]  terminals being shut down all over europe with the left calling for total open collapse i mean
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:51.680]  this is it this is this is the new orders launching on all fronts right now i'm gonna skip this
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:56.800]  network break to give us more time the only break today though i promise uh let's go ahead and go
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:03.840]  to don in canada you're on the air don welcome hey thank you alex a longtime listener and supporter
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:10.800]  thank you brother um just wanted to uh i'll talk about here what you're going through but uh i know
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:15.520]  everybody and yourself are on the fence about this double trump guy running for president here
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:22.720]  um i'd like to maybe see if you would approach this fella and see if he might want to support
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:28.160]  you in your money bond that's coming up here in uh next month well i mean i'm so hardcore that any
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:33.120]  mainline politician kind of treats us with kid gloves which is great if they if the establishment
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:38.800]  liked us that would be that would kill the broadcast uh i mean they always think shunning us
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:43.520]  hurts us no that's what we expect because we are the real deal trump's actually plugged in
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:48.560]  fall wars and joe biggs report that showed narcotics being shipped in the day he was there
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:55.040]  here in south texas last month uh or i guess maybe i was it was early early august was it
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:03.360]  late july uh and so i'm not on the fence about trump i don't trust him at a gut level but i
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:09.200]  like what he's saying and i see the fact that he may actually want to win and he makes money off
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:15.040]  a buoyed economy and off services and off real estate so he doesn't want the bubble to burst
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:19.680]  or or he wants to create a new economy so i'm giving him the benefit of the doubt
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:26.400]  while warning with provisos but yeah uh i want to sure i'll reach out to i mean listen the money
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:31.840]  bomb to raise a million dollars on the 16th that sounds like a lot to somebody that's you know
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:36.080]  making fifty thousand dollars a year a hundred thousand dollars a year for a tv network tv station
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:41.920]  that's uh not even a tenth of the money it takes to run something like that and we run it very
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:48.160]  inexpensively i mean fox news cost hundreds of millions a year to run hundreds of millions
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:55.360]  seeing it hundreds of millions uh we run this operation for it's well over 10 million dollars
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:01.440]  a year so that's why i spend so much time selling product promoting things you know trying to do that
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:07.600]  because we have to fund ourselves so we can be independent but absolutely um you know the problem
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:15.360]  is if i got money from trump then people will claim that i was beholden to him and that i've been
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:19.440]  bought by trump uh you know they already say the coat brothers have bought me when they own the
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:23.760]  democrats and republicans and i attacked both parties have never gotten a single dime from the
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:30.000]  coat brothers um so you know it's really good that we just support ourselves with the products we
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:37.200]  sell and the services we have um but if there was no strings attached uh i mean you know i'd take 10
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:40.880]  million dollars from trump and put in this operation have a big effect but i mean i'm not
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:44.720]  going to hold my breath i appreciate your call don and no i knew you were off topic we're not
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:49.600]  screening your calls on air it's one of my pet peeves everybody tells you what they want to talk
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:53.920]  about and then ask if it's okay because i know when you call regular radio you get interrogated
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:57.600]  for five minutes we just want to know where you're calling from what your name is hire listing if
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:00.960]  you want to tell us and if you want to volunteer something so we have on the board you know what
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:06.720]  you're calling about that's fine uh but just god bless you serve it's an interesting idea
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:12.480]  but you don't need to ask permission to cover what you want and i've said that probably 5 000 times
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:19.200]  and it just doesn't seem to work but that's okay uh let's talk to charles in georgia you're on the
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:27.920]  here hey how you doing mr um elif jones we appreciate you thank you sir well let's want to let you
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:34.560]  know that i got your uh i saw your report online uh that you made for us and i was just at all i
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:40.160]  called keith and keith uh told me about it and i was like wow i can't believe this we're actually
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:45.520]  on the news and stuff and uh well for folks that don't know you called sunday because we didn't have
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:50.720]  a private conversation listeners and callers you'll do with me on air why don't you fill folks in you
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:55.120]  made a documentary i thought it was interesting so i told the crew about it and then they ended up
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:59.680]  doing a piece of the nightly news because our number one imperative here is to promote other
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:07.040]  liberty activists that are fighting the new world order to rise up and build up and uh exemplify
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:13.120]  and and and dignify and support people that are fighting the new world order because you are the
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:19.280]  resistance you are the answer but i'll go ahead and give us your point on the topic yes sir i'm
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:23.920]  going to need to address after this as well so i can send you the uh uncut version of the video
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:30.640]  that we have um what they did was i just got i just got an email from keith my field manager
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:36.720]  and he told me that um what they did was they reinstated the ban on one of the scenes that we
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:45.200]  got in our documentary film uh banning our video in 232 country worldwide yeah let's be specific
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:50.960]  you made a documentary say the name of it say your youtube channel and then it got censored
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:55.760]  and now because of our coverage and other folks they're starting to take the man away but not
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:03.520]  fully so tell folks about the film okay the film is revealing the mind of a tyrant and we get into
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:10.080]  how obama is connected to adolf hitler and uh we talk about how obama's policies are the exact
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:18.560]  same blueprint to hitler's mind comp book and uh we point out the fact that barack obama has done
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:23.760]  everything against god just like hitler called for all of the bibles to be burned barack obama
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:30.800]  openly is passing policies against god with uh homosexual marriage and uh abortion promoting
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:36.160]  planned parenthood who killed babies who kills uh babies and harvest their organs and everything
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:40.960]  we point out that margaret senior the white supremacist is supported by haley clinton we
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:44.720]  actually showed a clip if you can show the clip later on in your show again to let people know
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:50.400]  that margaret senior was indeed a white supremacist and haley clinton said that she was an inspiration
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:55.920]  to all people and everything a known white supremacist that said the only thing that a black
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:02.880]  negro can do to keep from uh to benefit is to keep from being born in this society that's the
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:07.040]  best way to deal with a black negro margaret senior said that the white supremacist and then
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:12.880]  she spoke at five different clan rallies she did as well and we point that out in our film
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:19.760]  revealing the mind of a tyrant i urge everybody to please support that film uh we we were able
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:26.240]  to repeal youtube again but we were expanding on this there's no profanity you're clearly fair
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:32.240]  use showing clips of public figures you do a good job uh it's it's it's it's amateur but the
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:37.200]  information is powerful it's coming across to people so they've restricted it they've banned it
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:43.360]  you've had to put it back up and this just shows how controlled this country's getting god bless
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:49.440]  you i appreciate your call and it just illustrates where all this is going but if you look at the
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:55.760]  mind of a tyrant it looks like something i made 18 19 years ago now look at what we've done and
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:24:02.640]  that's why i support independent activists and try to promote their material here uh is because
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:08.320]  that's the answer to stop the globalist is to get everybody to be a mouthpiece for truth
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:16.240]  a watchman on the wall a paul revere to expose what's happening and that's what we're doing
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:21.360]  and the globalist want to destroy all of our communities that's why they're pushing the most
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:28.960]  vile nasty arrogant racist groups like black lives matter and the new black panther party
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:33.680]  who are just useful idiots is because they want to set each other's throats and
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:39.040]  we all know that so let's expose it and let's speak out against it and it's just going to
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:44.000]  continue to happen just like planned parenthood's being exposed and hillary's in deep trouble
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:51.360]  we're on the march the empire is on the run we have the power evil people are only in control
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:25:00.960]  because we've laid down so long that needs to change and yes what youtube does is when the
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:08.480]  white house or the democratic party or other groups who are in power don't like a website
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:12.000]  remember john mccain said he should be able to just go on youtube and take down whatever he wants
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.360]  uh uh we remember when he was a senator said that too about five years ago so it's republicans too
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.160]  but whoever's in power they want to just be able to go in there and take down whatever they want
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:29.440]  whenever they want and when you got a small channel but they see some video going viral
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:34.400]  they'll censor you big channels they don't do so much because they know that there's a lot of
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:39.040]  people watching and they don't want to have that reputation see if you have your own media to speak
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:43.680]  out they don't want to censor you if you're big but if you're small but up and coming
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:48.000]  they want to chop you off where you get big and then once they've chopped you off you don't have a
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:54.720]  venue let me give you some advice doppelganger videos put them on facebook put them on youtube i
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:59.600]  don't mean just spread them on facebook or twitter put them on facebook and twitter video
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:04.320]  put them on other platforms if you're going to put a video up put it up five places
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:11.440]  every time they censor you double down triple down quadruple down i mean i've been walking
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:15.040]  out the door before at six at night and i get a death threat on my cell phone i go that's it
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:21.920]  not coming home i'm gonna work an extra five hours somebody threatens my family with a hardcore real
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:29.440]  threat that just lights a fire under my butt let's go to john in new york go ahead what do
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:33.680]  you make of the epidemic of police and others being shot the media trying to cover up it's
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:39.840]  racially motivated what do you think the white house in game is um i think it's ultimately to
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:46.000]  have everybody it's ultimately divide and conquer i'm calling out a femo region too and
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.960]  i just wonder if any of the new black panther party is actually read any of the writings from
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:58.480]  the old black panther party like bobby shield sees the time when they flat out say you know all power
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:05.760]  to all people that basically say all lives matter and it's just messed up um and as i was
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:11.200]  sitting here listening i was um you made a lot of points about how the hip hop culture was taken
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:19.040]  over and i'm actually a political rapper um i rap with a group called boondocks we're out of philadelphia
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:24.800]  and out of western new york and our websites i'm trying to tell you cuz entertainment um we've
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:30.640]  got a lot of good stuff on there but really people need to wake up i mean i told joseph watson
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:37.280]  did an interview over the weekend about some lady on mtv saying that black people can't be racist
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:42.800]  i experienced racism from other black people and i'm black just for the way that i for the way that
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:49.680]  i speak so you know people just need to wake up and come together great job oh yeah let's be clear
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:53.600]  if you're a black person i've read about this i've seen it i've experienced it i remember growing up
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:28:00.560]  in dallas uh there were black kids who were real good in school dressed in like sports jackets uh
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:04.880]  because their parents were real christian kept them away from all the thug culture and i remember
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:10.640]  the black kids the bad black kids would mess with them beat them up you know tear their clothes do
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:16.960]  mean things to them because they were simply trying to be successful that's selling out i guess
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:24.080]  according to the gangster culture right right and um a lot of people it's ridiculous a lot of
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:30.240]  people run around um you showed clips of some of these protesters saying that they they believe
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:35.760]  in that and what melka max taught but clearly they didn't read the end of his autobiography
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:43.200]  when he went on his pilgrimage and came back with the name al-hashmili al-shaba's and you know
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:49.040]  said flat out that he was wrong well listen what what what the white house is pushing through
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:54.000]  these dumb kids who are just useful idiots i mean you know all of them out there black white
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.240]  doesn't matter that are pushing this is they're ignoring what martin luther king said they're
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:02.240]  saying the opposite they're ignoring what melka max said in the last third of his life they're
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:08.560]  saying the opposite uh they're ignoring the third of his career they're ignoring just common sense
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:14.720]  and they're arrogant hateful little thugs and they have the same look in their eyes i've seen in
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:22.320]  the klan it is a gangster thug mentality and that's what they're doing god bless you john i

[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:08.640]  essentially three ways that historic monuments are destroyed either in a hail of gunfire as
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:14.640]  it's exchanged by warring soldiers or demolished by bombs dropped from the air or more recently
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:19.680]  by a frankenstein monster of religious zealots arrogantly expressing their domination of a
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:25.600]  captured area and destruction of idols hundreds of casualties in air raids on syrian market
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:31.840]  and the media is demonizing the syrian government saying how dare they it looks like a bunch of
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:37.920]  civilians got killed because al qaeda isis as they always do base their head base in the city
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:43.440]  they've taken over this is admitted in the middle of the market meanwhile the united nation stands

[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:05.920]  i'll never forget the abortionist when we were out at that demonstration they're running around
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:11.040]  yelling hell satan i love the devil i love killing babies i'm ugly i'm fat i have hair under my arms
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:16.720]  these are actual quotes you've seen the video and heard it i shouldn't laugh i mean they just hate
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:23.200]  life they hate decency they hate prosperity they just hate honorable people they're they're scum
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:28.880]  i mean i don't want to call them dog crap on my shoes because that's insulting dog droppings i mean
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:38.640]  i'm serious and there's that clip of david night's really sweet wife and of course they adopted
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:43.600]  their daughter uh from china she was basically starving when they got over there to the orphanage
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:51.200]  and uh she was like two years old and she said i didn't she was oh yeah you adopt your white
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:59.200]  baby's erasers she goes no i i didn't adopt my baby oh the white savior oh oh she goes well do
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:07.280]  do you adopt your kids she goes i kill my kids with playa showing her teeth i kill my kids
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.920]  these are the type of groups and organizations that make up black lives matter
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:18.000]  and these horrible communist organizations it's all the same people i've been around them for 23
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:24.640]  years politically active i'd be out of the second amendment rally 23 years ago or a pro-life
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:29.280]  demonstration and people in black white black hispanic they're always the same they always had
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:34.960]  like dead eyes and gray looking skin even the black people have like gray green skin like ghouls out
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:41.360]  of a movie it's like omega man and they come over they're like we're gonna kill you someday we'll take
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:48.880]  over and i'd be like man don't you care about people's freedom what's your problem get you i mean
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:56.880]  they're white creatures out of a parable out of a fable and now i realize that's in the fairy tales
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:06.400]  and in the cultures because there's always been people like that you know it's like linda blairs
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:12.000]  turns green and spits out you know green vomit and that's an exaggeration of what these people
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.320]  are like i mean you're around them and they're looking at you with hatred and then their their
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:21.360]  skins like see-through they go i mean i don't know their demons man their demon possess they'll even
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:26.240]  like have like weird purple bruises and veins up on their necks it's like a zombie in a movie
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:31.360]  if you look at the video carefully black white didn't matter i mean these people are evil and
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:38.960]  they'll tell you that we are evil and they're just so weak is also what's pathetic but we let them rule
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:48.320]  over us so they get off on their power trips in fact can we play that with the audio a little
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:53.120]  joke promo about the abortion team the dare mcbrain again the master editor put together and then
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:58.800]  i'm gonna go back to your calls and the news i'm ranting here let's go ahead and go to the abortion
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:05.840]  team here it is in today's world abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:12.880]  an attempt to bully activists if you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:23.360]  worshipers maybe you can call the 18 i kill my kids i kill my kids
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:36.960]  hey we saw your facebook with your communist hammer and sickle that's pretty cool man is that you on
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:43.840]  the facebook is there a facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle i don't think so
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:59.120]  how do you get your abortion fee i pay for them i thought you'd say three uh upwards of 50
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:09.440]  really oh yeah you piece of bunch misogynist mother f*** take your male privilege somewhere
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:32.000]  out probably being aggressive i'm being aggressive from the front lines of the information war
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:39.280]  it's alex jones and you laugh at those people but they are they are the scum of the earth
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:45.200]  and there's good in this world and there's evil and there's those of us that lay down to it who i
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:53.120]  guess are in the middle but it's so clear that we just have to say no to these people and let them
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:41:00.240]  crawl back in their trash cans i mean that's what this comes down to but they're laughing in there
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:09.600]  he actually crawled in head in the dumpster and he couldn't even hardly walk like doing a zombie act
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:17.200]  but he was serious and then they were all just so rat-like and so weak but of course weakness
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:24.320]  is drawn towards dead babies i mean what type of entity is into this and and i don't think it's
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:29.440]  it's human in origin i think there's some type of interdimensional thing like hellraiser and
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:34.960]  that these people are basically entities little little demons hopping around okay let me just
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:39.040]  tell you i i've got a hurry through calls because i want to get to some of this news on the economy
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:43.600]  on the check republic and what's happening in europe as well but steven in texas thanks for
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:50.000]  holding her on the air worldwide how's it going alex is uh my first time calling um a long time
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:55.600]  listener as well welcome i'm gonna take state two things um yeah so the whole that black lives
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:00.880]  matter thing um i was just wondering like you know i work at a shooting range and actually
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:05.200]  pretty popular shooting range in texas and like i run a lot of nicks checks and stuff
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:09.040]  and you know i'm a big libertarian i don't think there should be background checks and all that
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:13.600]  stuff but you know a lot of yuppies all the time like always ask the you know stricter background
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:18.800]  checks and you know i was just wondering why is there like no you know no part on there that has
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:26.160]  you know um ssr drugs on there because ssr i drugs that admit on the insert can make you
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:31.680]  run around murdering people with guns or whatever they are a multi-billion dollar industry and
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:37.760]  they don't want to be targeted plus it's not in law that if you're on those drugs uh that you
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:45.680]  can be restricted uh and i and i don't want to pass new drug laws as well uh but i i don't think
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:52.160]  people that are on ssr i's should have firearms probably the problem is then they'll just order
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:58.560]  you on ssr i's courts can do that and then take your guns but it's a complex issue i know a federal
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:03.680]  court ruled last week and i didn't cover this you guys print that i forgot to that illegal
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:08.480]  aliens have a right to keep their arms to defend themselves and you know i actually think even
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:14.480]  if you're an illegal alien and are a felon here that there is such a basic right to defense that
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:20.000]  you should have the right to a firearm but so should i i believe felons like the old days until
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.280]  68 when they get out of prison if they were arrested with a gun that they owned legally give it back
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:29.760]  to them in the old days they'd keep your guns till you got out of prison and you just better not
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:36.080]  commit a new crime because the criminal is going to get a gun anyways uh so i say no gun loss now
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:41.520]  i am a private property guy and if somebody wants to say no guns on our private property
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:48.000]  and wants to do that then that's their their their their authorization under private property to be
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:53.200]  idiots and advertise their place as they shoot them up zone for crazies i don't agree with it i
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:58.800]  think it's stupid it ignores logic and common sense but it's their right it is their right
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:05.040]  to not let you have a gun if a church says no guns in here if a liquor store says no guns in here
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:10.160]  if a bar says no guns in here if a restaurant says no guns in here if a mall wants to say that
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:15.760]  that's their issue that's their issue their private property but outside of private property
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:22.320]  i am for an absolute right to keep my arms uh that is what it comes down to now if an airplane
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:26.480]  company says hey we're american airlines we don't want people with guns on board because they might
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:31.360]  shoot a hole through the window or something that's fine but then you better provide armed guards on
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:38.160]  that plane so there aren't hijackers oh no we don't do that when the captain comes out to urinate
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:44.960]  on a flight they have the stewardess put the drink cart in the hall and act like she's gonna
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:50.720]  gonna fight somebody i mean it's just ridiculous arm the pilots god bless you steve good to hear
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:56.720]  from you great point deon in illinois on the current shooting that's left one police officer dead
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:05.280]  in fox lake illinois with helicopters armored vehicles rolling around in another reaction uh i mean
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:12.480]  well like we saw uh with the situation in boston uh go ahead what's your view on this
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:22.160]  yeah i think they're now confirming that it is uh three suspect shooters one is black two are white
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:30.400]  so they shot the police officer at the gasoline station uh so i i know the area is predominantly
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:35.680]  white there's a lot of drugs here in the area is predominantly a republican voter
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:42.400]  so you live in the town or nearby yeah i live about five minutes from uh from the shooting
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:48.080]  i did see that in fact that just came out as you print me the article about the identity of the
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:52.960]  shooters they believe they have the identities uh and this could be drug related or it could be a
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:57.520]  lot of the black lives matter type groups are just thugs that use that mantle and if you
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:00.480]  you know a sheriff clark has pointed out there's a lot of people that aren't black now
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:07.680]  that are part of this attack the cop movement um but uh i'm quite frankly i i suspected because
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:12.960]  it's at a gas station that it's a cold-blooded murder and not a cop about to bust people so
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:18.160]  they're shooting uh that it's premeditated capital murder that it appears to be cold-blooded but cops
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:23.600]  hunt three suspects in shooting of illinois police officer and if you scroll up i'll read the uh
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:28.800]  breakdown of that a community an hour north of chicago was on lockdown and a massive man hunt
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:33.360]  for three armed and dangerous suspects was underway after police officer was fatally shot
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:38.560]  tuesday morning helicopters were circling above fox lake illinois and law enforcement agency
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:44.640]  from the area along with the regional swat team and k9 units were hunting for as many of three
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:50.320]  suspects after police officer was shot around eight a.m and guys you've read that where's the
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:55.360]  description of the people can you find that because i know that's on the article i have right here
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:00.240]  what are they saying on your news what news is reporting that uh that you're seeing there dion
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:08.400]  the local affiliate news uh fox new chicago a bc new chicago uh speaking about the helicopters
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:13.200]  they have three helicopters they have swat teams and ramps going around they're telling people to
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:20.560]  stay home schools are in lockdown and uh it's hard for business to operate when these uh kind of
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:28.160]  situations occur because uh it discourages people from spending money in the economy and they need
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:33.440]  that for their small business there's a lot of small businesses around here yeah well i know this
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:37.520]  in the past when a cop or anybody got shot they didn't do these full lockdowns unless they knew
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:42.080]  specifically where they were and then that's reasonable for a certain small area these general
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:46.480]  cordons like they had of half of boston or more of half didn't catch the guy it was a citizen and
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:51.840]  he was outside the cordon uh the supposed guy that was clearly a made-up operation
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:48:00.960]  so it really just comes down to that that uh this is the the big overreaction uh detective
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:06.240]  christopher covelli with lake county sheriff's office said the suspects were described as two
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:14.160]  white men and one black man so there that is from nbc and from fox all reporting that uh dion thank
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:21.840]  you so much yeah it's um i don't agree with the police tactic of locking down whole towns whole
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:28.560]  cities to find someone i mean i understand they think that that stops the movement and so then
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:32.560]  they can catch the guys moving and they can't blend them with the crowd but uh i think finding the
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:36.960]  identity and working with the citizens is the way to catch these people and it's been proven that
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:42.640]  that isn't what's catching people so it just seems like oh here are our toys here's our armored
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:47.040]  vehicles here's our helicopters none of that protected you and that's what i've pointed out if a
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:52.080]  civil war breaks out in this country that's not going to protect the police stopping the civil
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:58.960]  war is going to protect everybody but the globalists have lined all this up you can see them setting

[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:37.280]  so i try to put my money where my mouth is and the chiapas rebels had actually defeated the
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:42.800]  mexican government for 15 years running and even though they're leftist they're at least pro gun
[02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:49.280]  and have taken their areas back so i am supporting because they got good coffee and you can buy it at
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:53.520]  inforwarstore.com but i didn't mean to do a plug let's go to robert and louisiana
[02:01:53.520 --> 02:02:00.800]  you're on the air i want to hear your story go ahead i was just there uh i own a small bar
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:06.560]  in ellis angela louisiana i have a customer that bought a condo that was right around the corner
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:11.600]  so i mean another customer jumped in the car to leave we were immediately pulled over by seven
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:18.400]  police officers we were pulled out the car separated he was given a dwi test he passed
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:25.360]  the call was ram sack three or four times there was no drugs after all this was gone it's still
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:31.760]  separated female cop was called to the scene female cop comes rubber gloves further violates
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:38.560]  the female customer still nothing i said this is kind of excessive he looks to me and says i'm six
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:44.560]  foot two i have kind of aggressive sometimes but he goes so what are you gonna tell us how to do our
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:50.080]  job or do you pay taxes no you don't pay taxes so yes i pay taxes you go okay you're just telling
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:55.440]  us how to do our job i said well sir it looks like you're really working hard he goes your
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.480]  he just looked at me he goes i don't believe a fucking word you say horrible aggressive search
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:04.640]  the guy again sorry sir i want to hear your story but you can't you can't cuss on there i'm going to
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:12.240]  let you go yes they've militarized the police they've got an out there revenue generating
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:17.600]  criminal elements of the government and the big banks are on record it's not disputable now
[02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:23.920]  shipping in the majority of the narcotics i'm against the drug war i'm against militarizing police
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:33.040]  i'm against all of this and we try to reform it and i absolutely get that the constitution is
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:39.600]  being trampled by many police departments historically i've noticed we've gotten a lot bigger changes
[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:46.720]  when we take control of our counties our cities through elections when we support good cops and
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:50.880]  when we expose bad cops i wanted to hear where you were going but you cussed we had to let you go
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:54.880]  because then we delay you out and then you could cuss again and then it would go out then we get
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:04:00.640]  an FCC violation so many shows are internet only they don't understand that we're on a whole bunch
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:04.800]  of AM and FM stations we can't have cussing folks so if you want to be hung up on go ahead and cuss
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:13.520]  i'll let you go um but the police are going to get more aggressive with everybody because
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:18.080]  so many cops are getting shot and long before there was this epidemic of cops getting shot
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:24.240]  i told you i got pulled over when i was a senior in high school about five o'clock in the afternoon
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:29.120]  my mom said go get me some frozen yogurt i drove like two miles down the road driving home probably
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:34.160]  going five miles over the speed limit he pulls the turn i turn on my street my parent's street
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:38.560]  he pulls in behind me i had a weight belt sitting in the front of the seat i've been lifting weights
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:43.280]  he's like all right lost his registration rub so it's cussing puts the gun to my head
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:50.480]  talk about quick draw i mean but then he apologized said it looked like a big knife or gun
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:55.120]  scabbard and let me off the ticket but the point is he could have blown my head off
[02:04:55.680 --> 02:05:00.480]  and it was because he was so jumpy and i was white he was white the vast majority of criminals
[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:06.080]  don't buy guns from gun shows according to a survey by the university of chicago crime lab
[02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:11.760]  in the survey of nearly 100 detainees at the cook county jail about 70 percent said they
[02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:17.120]  bought guns from social connections or corrupt cops and only a handful then purchased guns from
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:22.880]  licensed dealers at shops or shows some of the pathways people are concerned about don't seem
[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:29.600]  so dominant said herald pollock co-director of the crime lab the survey also revealed that ar15s
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:36.240]  and ak 47s often demonized as quote assault rifles by the media are unpopular among thugs
[02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:41.440]  and despite chicago's strict gun control laws inmates were able to get a gun within six months
[02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:47.760]  of release police take the guns and put them back on the street one inmates said in other words

[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:40.320]  larry nickles joins us he's just recently had surgery he's battling cancer we should all pray
[02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:45.600]  for him i've received some criticism for having larry nickles on even though i've been interviewing
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:52.400]  him for 20 years i've been battling the clintons and their corruption and putting up with their
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:09:00.000]  attacks and censorship ever since i was physically attacked one time in a parking lot by organized
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:05.280]  hired thugs and told to back off the clintons back off weco back off the judge because i was
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:11.920]  holding demonstrations and covering the fact that they'd been found not guilty of the general crimes
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:16.000]  of murder but then found guilty of using guns and the commission of murder how was it they were
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:22.240]  still being held in prison and so for that the media claimed i was a dividian uh even though i
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:27.840]  was just trying to get justice and then they sent people to beat me up so that's how authoritative
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:34.400]  the clintons are and that's how serious their intimidation is but larry nickles was a fixer
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:41.120]  forum he was a politico that worked for him high level along with other top names early on the
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:47.440]  clinton operation uh if you don't know the story his dad was dying of cancer he just had a Saul of
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:55.360]  tarsus moment on the road to Damascus when he just said i can't end up being involved in
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:10:02.960]  clinton murders and basically stuff he knew that was probably going on and drug dealing cocaine
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:08.560]  drug dealing and it's all come out from me and not just from him but from terry reed and countless
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:14.960]  others the narcotics being flown in there by the time every few days and so he lost basically
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:20.240]  everything he had uh when he was clinton's big buddy because he said he wouldn't go along with it
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:24.960]  he spearheaded the clinton chronicles part one and two but a lot of people around those films
[02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:34.400]  ended up dying so i see him as the prodigal son he went out he did bad things and then he didn't
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:39.040]  turn around once he got in trouble and said i want to be good he turned around while he was rich
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:45.600]  and powerful and about to be inside the white house riding that gravy train that so many other
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:50.320]  clintonistas have ridden i mean the clintons have ridden their fame to 500 plus million dollars
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:57.440]  between the two of them conservatively and billions in their foundation and we we may be seeing the
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:02.800]  fall of hillary clinton right now because the heat is coming out so serious it was nickles months ago
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:08.160]  that said he believes it's obama trying to shut her down so he can set up the new dynasty
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:14.160]  and be in control and line up his people because people are sick of the clintons even bad people
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:19.040]  are sick of them because they have been running the show for a very very long time but i don't
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:24.400]  know what's worse the clintons are obama and it just shows or jeb bush it just shows how much
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:31.200]  trouble we're in uh i know the bushes are bad news but i just can't imagine i know this the bushes
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:36.560]  aren't as aggressive on the ground with activists and media we've seen obama arrest more reporters
[02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:42.080]  than anybody in the history and he's worse than lincoln and you've seen uh all the persecution
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:52.960]  of whistleblowers um that's the clinton's hand with obama the bushes don't do that as bad i mean
[02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:58.720]  i've lived under both regimes and i'm not saying i want the bushes in there i want ran paul or i'd
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:04.480]  take a donald trump i mean anything but these dynasties but larry nickles you know some people
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:10.480]  criticize me and they said what are you doing having a guy that some people say was you know
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:17.920]  he's a medley dixie mafia high-level uh worked in weird special ops in latin america probably a
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:23.440]  hitman on and on and on what are you doing having larry nickles on your show well he's a consummate
[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:30.160]  clinton insider and he lost everything to tell the truth and i've known him for 20 years and everything
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:34.720]  he's talked about has basically come true so there's credibility there but even though i
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:39.760]  thought he was a bad guy which i don't think he is i think he's really reprieved himself and
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:48.080]  reproved himself to a great extent he has courage and you know there's a quote from full metal jacket
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:54.720]  written by stanley cubrick where he says where the marine corps sergeant the drill sergeant says
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:13:00.240]  private joker's silly and he's ignorant but he's got guts and guts is enough well you know what
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:07.440]  larry nickles isn't silly and ignorant and he's got guts on top of it and he knows how dangerous
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:13.360]  what he's he's been shot at he's been attacked i mean they sent his thugs clinton's thugs to break
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:18.080]  people's kneecaps that even talk to jennifer flowers i've interviewed the women clinton would rape
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:24.720]  all the people they've killed and so that's why we sent the crew up to interview larry nickles and
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:30.160]  it came out like something that looks better than vice television on hbo i mean josh owens and jacari
[02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:34.240]  jackson really did a great job interviewing and mr nickles did a great job even though i know he's
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:38.960]  not in good health giving us the time over a couple days to do the interview and we're going to be
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:44.960]  premiering that somewhere here on the radio slash tv show the next few weeks but i just think it's
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:52.560]  important that you hear from somebody who was right there in the middle of it now before i go any
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:58.080]  further uh i said what do you want to cover first he goes i want to cover the n i six spy found dead
[02:13:58.080 --> 02:14:05.280]  in a bag in a bathtub who had hacked the clinton data and that's the daily mail one in telegraphs
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:10.160]  also reporting it it's not in u.s news right martin a few others have carried it
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:17.360]  well was it two and a half years ago david night did a report on this when it first happened
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:21.760]  and it's going to be in the fourth hour today we're bringing the fourth hour back that's going
[02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:27.680]  to be a roundup with our reporters and anchors and special guests we're going to have um rob do
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:34.000]  hosting and you know being the main um anchor and then we're going to have a commentary analysis
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:39.680]  and news on this subject and others jacari jackson and joe biggs tomorrow it's going to be leon
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:49.760]  macadoo uh and it's going to be rob do again uh and i think myself i'll probably ride shotgun along
[02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:53.600]  with that as well then when david night comes back he'll be hosting that fourth hour probably two
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:58.400]  or three days a week uh with the uh guest anchors uh as well but we're going to play that special
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:05.680]  report that night did a few years ago in context to this but when you read the article the local
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:10.720]  police get there and say he's clearly been murdered and you can read the articles when mi6 gets there
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:20.640]  who he worked for they say no uh it's normal to zip yourself up in a duffel bag from the inside out
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:25.120]  well the only time i've seen something stupider uh now an inquest has found there was foul play
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:30.400]  was when people would get their arms legs and head cut off and be in a plastic bag
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:36.320]  add a trash dump you don't cut your arms and legs and head off and then it's like saying you
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:40.960]  can cut yourself up and put yourself in a bottle like a ship in the bottle it's it's just upside
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:48.720]  down two plus two equals a hundred total malarkey bull but this is an illustration of him hacking
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:54.000]  in we have a clinton's chef now dad nobody likes to kill people like the clinton's or
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:16:03.040]  or as larry nickle says they don't do it people around them get the job done and that's how lakosa
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:09.360]  notra would do it i think it's time for our friends over there i think it's time for him to go on a
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:15.600]  vacation and then you know what happens but the clinton's really enjoy killing they and clinton
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:19.760]  enjoys getting a woman in a cloakroom with people right outside and biting them like a pit bull
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:25.680]  bite in her lip till blood drips and then raping them uh i mean these are a savage demonic group
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:31.600]  of people and i don't personally even hate them it's just i know they hate us they hate freedom
[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:36.000]  and this dove tells with this i want to go over other news with larry nickles and continue with
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:42.480]  phone calls um with mike and origan another mike and origan peter in washington josh in
[02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:47.040]  tennessee dug in minnesota they're on subjects all over the map the white house trying to get
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:52.320]  this cop killing spree going what's behind that larry nickles thank you so much for coming on with us
[02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:57.840]  hey thank you alex i didn't know you could do my voice i didn't know i had a distinctive voice
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:02.960]  well i got a raspy voice too but nothing like yours i'm sure i'll get like yours though
[02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:12.640]  well let me say alex it's uh i know you take heat for having me on i i know that i
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:19.280]  but you know heck i don't know what else to do you take pound for pound the things that i have said
[02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:26.320]  for the years you and i've known each other and then tell me any other you know it's amazing
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:34.000]  things i tell you they come true it happens well the clintons come out with their side of it
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:42.000]  the media jumps on their side of it attacks me and you for being around me and then there
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:48.240]  ends up being a lie but after all these years here's hillary running for president again
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:55.520]  and uh you know i'm still in that corner of people getting on to you for having me on
[02:17:55.520 --> 02:18:00.960]  oh it's a very small minority of people i mean i wanted to talk about why i admire your courage
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:04.960]  and what you've done and explain that because i think it's an important point we expect to get
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:12.000]  heat being in the kitchen but it's actually very mild i would expect uh more i mean people should
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:16.560]  really get well your last interview you know got hundreds of thousands of views on youtube just as
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:21.200]  a gauge millions here and each derivative of it got hundreds of thousands so over a million people
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:26.160]  on youtube watch the last one let's let's cover this subject as we go to break and i'll come back
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:30.720]  and try to shut up and give me the floor you talked about maybe obama might be the last president
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:36.560]  since then he made a statement about running for a third term wishing he could talk about that more
[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:43.760]  well the thing that everybody had better watch obama knows what i know there's only two people
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:50.560]  in this world that can stop him from his agenda which is to dedicate and make himself pain using
[02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:56.160]  the FEMA provisional government and now she's covered FEMA for years so don't let anybody fool
[02:18:56.160 --> 02:19:02.240]  you it's out there they're waiting to do it but obama wants to be that person and there's only
[02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:07.760]  two people that can stop him bill and hillary clinton they have the power to match him the key
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:16.000]  to this is watch joe biden if joe biden gets in the race then you can count on it with everything
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:22.880]  you got obama's planning to stay and he's going to do what he's got to do to be able to stay there
[02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:30.320]  now the question is do you want obama to be comes you've got hillary she's waiting for her day
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:37.600]  and if she can just get in the selection then she will make it collapse now alex it's a question
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:44.080]  of whether we the people want to be an islamic caliphate under obama and lead him to global
[02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:51.920]  power as the leader of islam worldwide or do we want to become a communist country under hillary
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:56.880]  with hillary appointing bill clinton which i know she's going to do with them i might choose the
[02:19:56.880 --> 02:20:04.000]  muslim thing other than being a commie i might choose the muslim deal over being a communist
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:09.440]  well i'm telling you muslim's cut your head off commies just put you in prison i you know it's a
[02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:14.080]  six one or another but i will say this within six months hillary will appoint bill ambassador
[02:20:14.080 --> 02:20:18.960]  through un and then because of what they've been doing in the un with the clinton foundation
[02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:25.920]  within six months of that they plan on him being the secretary general of the united nations or
[02:20:25.920 --> 02:20:32.000]  other words the leader of the un can you imagine they will have achieved what they told me about
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:37.680]  1986 they want to be the most powerful couple ever in the history of the world i skipped the
[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:42.960]  network break this is so cliffhanger and soky go back to those talks because quentin has now said
[02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:47.200]  it was like a decade after you said it on my show that he wants to be the leader of the un
[02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:51.680]  with hillary down the road being co-president and then they bring in the world government
[02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:55.520]  and then obama i didn't used to buy into this but really he is trying to set up a caliphate
[02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:59.760]  he is funny radical islamicist there is a takeover he is doing it through kenya
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:05.040]  i mean it's such double dealing i guess they really are like on their own teams trying to get
[02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:11.520]  global domination talk about that more well you know that's the problem haven't we've got the best
[02:21:11.520 --> 02:21:15.840]  government money can buy the problem is the people in america don't have money to buy it
[02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:24.160]  but you now have two distinct people trying to get control of this nation and it's all going
[02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:30.160]  to hinge on a thing called the fema provisional government plan whoever is president when a
[02:21:30.160 --> 02:21:36.320]  crisis is declared nationally when that day comes whoever's president becomes king now
[02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:43.360]  the way that works so people will know whoever's president takes total power there is no vice
[02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:48.640]  president number two is the commander of the joint chief staff all congressmen senators
[02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:58.240]  go back to their home states and they become the government there now what that does is the
[02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:03.760]  president when that happens becomes king and the only person that can call the crisis over as the
[02:22:03.760 --> 02:22:10.400]  president and as you know nobody's going to do that in 1986 the clinton's found out about this
[02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:19.120]  and bill and harry both came to me and said we want to be there that day get us there well
[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:27.120]  we joked i was can you imagine back in 1986 bill clinton and us all of the guys that were on the
[02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:32.320]  kitchen cabinet and him saying he wanted to be president and we're going oh yeah sure of course
[02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:37.120]  well he devised a plan to make him president but we figured the womanizing and all that stuff
[02:22:37.120 --> 02:22:43.520]  and get him so it was a joke but we started looking at reality if we ever got him there
[02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:49.120]  if he couldn't crash him femur when he was president then you had four out years which
[02:22:49.120 --> 02:22:53.760]  were the years when his term ended and then hillary would run well you know what happened
[02:22:53.760 --> 02:22:59.520]  she got beat by obama because she didn't follow our playbook she's following it now that's why
[02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:06.480]  i can tell you every second what hillary's doing i can tell you don't worry about all of this email
[02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:15.360]  stuff except all of this sudden in comes alec the fbi now remember obama just appoints a new
[02:23:15.360 --> 02:23:23.760]  head of the justice department a new director you know the attorney general and all of the sudden
[02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:30.480]  this attorney general six the fbi on these fbi files now let's let's tell the truth about that buddy
[02:23:30.480 --> 02:23:38.240]  number one if they prosecute hillary over the fbi are over the email it'll never happen
[02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:45.600]  because you see if they prosecute her over that alex then she's going to say well then i've got to
[02:23:45.600 --> 02:23:52.000]  use these classified emails as my defense well when she says that then the federal judge is going to
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:56.800]  say well you can't use that stuff as your defense and then therefore he's going to throw the case out
[02:23:56.800 --> 02:24:04.080]  out he has to throw the case out the clinton's know this but there's one thing laying right
[02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:11.040]  there obama's got biden getting in that race they're gonna kick hillary down and kick her down
[02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:18.480]  and if they can get biden in alex it's over it's over it'll never happen there won't be an election
[02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:24.560]  obama's gonna have a ride i think you see the intensity now over this black lives matter that's
[02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:29.040]  what i want to raise working at the highest levels of this even the new york times admitted
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:34.160]  you're one of clinton's top people uh in there in the original planning obviously i can see the
[02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:39.360]  angles of it destabilization all the problems but the boldness of having democratic party operatives
[02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:45.280]  running admittedly all these kill the cop grips they think they can get away with that i guess they
[02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:55.200]  will they will get away with what's the point of it well the point is this is between the clinton's
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:25:04.000]  and the obama i don't say obama's i mean obama and where do we sit where are we the people
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:10.720]  sit in the middle of this well we have got to stand up alex and your program is part of it we've
[02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:15.840]  got to stand up and declare we're not going to take it and we can through states rights but we
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:23.120]  got to get to moving on it or it's over but just set back folks and no i'm hey i'm not here telling
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:31.040]  you about obama look for yourself do you really believe that all of these these black lives matter
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:38.160]  things are really occurring just out of the blue do you're not thinking odd that obama has not
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:43.520]  sent his justice department to shut this stuff down hey alex you get out there and tell your
[02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:48.640]  audience hey let's go kill a cop say how long you can move around i'm going to be arrested
[02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:55.760]  about two hours in your jail yeah so you know that's out there well then you got to ask why
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:26:00.960]  folks i'm not trying to get you to buy into a pig in the poke i'm asking you ask yourself why
[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:07.920]  why is it when obama was elected we were told oh thank god races finally over and he's done
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:15.920]  everything in his power and then some to make race a hotter issue now than the day the man came in
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:23.680]  and if you don't believe he is working hard to get these riots activated and when the riots
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:29.200]  the riots get activated alex here's the part people don't understand when these black mobs
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:34.000]  start running wild and shooting wildly into the neighborhood you know what people are doing this
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:41.440]  country they'll call up and say please send the government and stop it protect us we will call
[02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:47.040]  for the federal government to come in and protect us we will call for the civil emergency we will
[02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:52.640]  we'll be the ones asking for it because you know what we'll be scared we'll be scared now tell
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:57.120]  something else you might as well know y'all don't think i'm crazy but get ready to grease the banana
[02:26:57.120 --> 02:27:04.960]  truck and i'm fixing to tell you there's a reason cuba we normalize relations with cuba alex you
[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:10.880]  know you've talked to enough military people yourself and you know obama has gone through
[02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:17.040]  and selectively purged the military for anybody that would dare to not take his orders under a
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:21.680]  crisis condition in this country they're gearing up they're getting everything lined up get up well
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:26.960]  watch this folks you see obama and his people and i'm sure the generals have told them when it comes
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:32.640]  to telling american soldiers to crack down on the people of america they're not gonna do it
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:40.160]  they're not gonna do it it'll end pretty quick so what has obama done he's gone to the one military
[02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:46.880]  force that i personally ran into in nicaragua he's got the cuban military that will be brought in here
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:55.040]  under the auspices of all milling augmenting our military to help keep us in line you know i'd laugh
[02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:59.280]  at that except i remember it was in the washington post after i saw it in restricted documents that
[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:05.600]  were leaked about 14 years ago right after 9 11 where they were saying in the washington post
[02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:11.200]  will have canadian and mexican and other latin american troops in america during a civil emergency
[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:18.720]  it predates obama and the clinton's and then it expanded uh to where they're now openly pushing
[02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:24.960]  this idea again and so we know they have a plan for a multinational force once there's a civil war
[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:30.240]  but that does make a lot of sense and the pope's coming here to call for socialism and world
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:36.480]  government i mean everything's really moving fast now everything is moving according to an
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:44.800]  area of time and has it as you get closer to an event time compresses and that's where we're at
[02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:50.400]  but now remember why cuba why do we have to normalize relations with cuba because that's the only
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:56.880]  place that has a standing army within two hours can put 200 000 troops on our ground
[02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:02.320]  you can't do it rest you can't do it by the way ain't doing real good getting along that's what
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:07.840]  they do in red dawn is they dress cubans up like mexicans flying in on jumbo jets with the noses
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:12.560]  popping off and and used to i'd say this is crazy even though no new the soviets had a plan to do
[02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:19.200]  this but the thing is they're so crazy obama's now renaming mountains like a dictator i mean
[02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:23.760]  they're just getting us ready that was one of the things that we did under clinton clinton would
[02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:27.360]  say well how am i gonna hide this i'll say put it right under their nose that's where nobody will
[02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:33.680]  find it they're right there nobody will believe it when we say things alex think about the things
[02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:38.480]  you have said think about the things i've said with you over the years remember when they were
[02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:42.800]  said that was crazy that was even crazy that was so far well i know they're thinking about
[02:29:42.800 --> 02:29:46.960]  marshal law that's admitted and i know the white house is trying to start a race for i mean who
[02:29:46.960 --> 02:29:54.160]  knows what's gonna happen next we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[02:29:54.160 --> 02:30:03.520]  network we're being told that snowden's window for a plea bargain deal is closing bloomberg reports
[02:30:03.520 --> 02:30:07.440]  the national security specialist saying many people in government believe the journalists who
[02:30:07.440 --> 02:30:12.480]  receive snowden's material are not capable of protecting it from a competent and committed
[02:30:12.480 --> 02:30:17.680]  state-level adversary even if snowden did not give the material to others they argue it would have
[02:30:17.680 --> 02:30:22.800]  been ripe for the picking well isn't that true of hillary's handling of emails didn't her violation
[02:30:22.800 --> 02:30:29.440]  of protocol expose above top secret data to state-level adversaries snowden exposed criminal
[02:30:29.440 --> 02:30:35.360]  actions of our government done in the name of national security hillary compromised national
[02:30:35.360 --> 02:30:41.760]  security for her own convenience or to cover up her misdeeds if national security is more
[02:30:41.760 --> 02:30:46.320]  important than the constitution if national security is more important than our rights
[02:30:46.320 --> 02:30:53.600]  why isn't hillary being prosecuted why is snowden called a traitor and hillary clinton is called

[02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:50.320]  emergencies in the check republic stopping all westbound trains they're being called racist by
[02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:55.680]  germany and england saying let everyone in trance foreign minister says just take unlimited pay for
[02:33:55.680 --> 02:34:02.240]  it put people in your house this is their political takeover i'm not against the immigrants they're
[02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:07.200]  just being used as the weapon so the globalists are turning isis and al-qaeda loose to run around
[02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:12.800]  and murder everybody and then they're on the news this weekend the white house like and others yeah
[02:34:12.800 --> 02:34:17.680]  we've got to start doing something about isis there with iran we're gonna bomb Assad
[02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:26.160]  knowing the public doesn't understand that iran and obama are fighting isis and i'm not saying
[02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:33.120]  iran's good but they're lying to you i have the articles right here in just four years half of
[02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:39.680]  syrian population of twenty million has been killed displaced or fled the country four million
[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:46.640]  refugees then it ties into this article russia to begin airstrikes against isis in syria russian
[02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:52.560]  presence is there they've sent hundreds of russian pilots and aircraft to a forward operating base
[02:34:52.560 --> 02:34:59.440]  outside demascus and are going to start now attacking isis so we heard russia was fleeing
[02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:06.480]  and leaving that was all disinformation and we're in the position of russia fighting the most vicious
[02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:10.800]  islamic extremists ever that our government's allied with and they go on the news and act like
[02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:17.280]  obama's fighting it what i'm saying is i studied iran contra i studied other corrupt events nothing
[02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:29.520]  was ever one tenth of this this is so gopher broke so just huge it's so flagrant it's so reckless it's
[02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:38.640]  so naked it's so wild just like all these it's admittedly george soros white house run with
[02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:46.880]  people chanting approved stuff to kill cops i mean the white house knows it's going to cause
[02:35:46.880 --> 02:35:51.600]  innocent cops to be shot i mean i know they're villainous but who wants to just randomly kill
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:57.200]  cops or anybody for that matter because they want to bring this country down folks they call us
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:04.480]  bitter clingers it's on and they want to get the police maneuvered into a position to try to come
[02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:09.520]  after our guns which they're now calling for an msnbc you know it is time to confiscate them they
[02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:13.760]  say we don't want their guns we played the clip yesterday we do want them time to take them
[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:19.840]  i want all those reporters and all the social engineers to know something all the bankers
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:23.680]  you think you're gonna be immune from all this and the citizens and the cops we're all just
[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:28.400]  gonna kill each other because we're a bunch of idiots you are the ones that are gonna be held

[02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:50.560]  clarity stabilization the clear insanity the clear fact of trying to get a race war going on this
[02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:56.480]  country do you think they're being successful what do you think the next shoot a drop is what else
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:40:03.200]  is on larry nickles radar oh wow well first off yes they're going to be successful they're being
[02:40:03.200 --> 02:40:10.160]  very successful at it and it's easy to do when you are in america today like we were in arkansas
[02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:15.360]  during my time with bill clinton we controlled the press so if you control the press press guess
[02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:22.080]  what alex you control what people hear how many times they hear it and if you keep telling them
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:27.600]  to lie long enough it becomes true so you can tell them that uh the north pole is warm and sunny
[02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:34.320]  guarantee it guarantee it i've done it now i would say to everybody about this program
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:39.760]  folks you better hear alex when he's telling you because i hope you understand i got there's
[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:44.320]  nothing to me with alex i'm not a part of his network or anything but i'm going to tell you
[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:50.800]  we're on a short fuse this thing is coming down right before our eyes now i'll give you another
[02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:59.200]  little tip you know alex this whole thing with aran and i hear about all that's going on and what's
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:06.800]  actually in the agreement number one folks congress at any time it wants can hold a session and they
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:11.280]  can vote and say guess what this is an agreement this is a treaty and therefore the president
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:16.560]  has zero ability to affect a treaty without getting congressional approval number one
[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:21.760]  number two if you don't think we're being betrayed and if you don't think it's out in the open
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:30.480]  every member of congress knows that when they did the corker treasonous bill that what that did
[02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:37.840]  it didn't stop obama from his iran agreement now folks hear me well on this it didn't stop it
[02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:46.160]  it's shut off the only way there was to stop this agreement if you come out and find out that iran
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:52.560]  has been given the keys to washington dc there's nothing anybody can do thanks to the corker bill
[02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:58.640]  which is going to allow every member of commerce to vote quote end of quote against the agreement
[02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:03.680]  right so they're going to get their little snippet that they can use in their commercials and their
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:10.800]  little ads saying well i was against it but they actually voted for the one thing that could have
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:16.240]  stopped that you see with the corker bill they fixed it to where our government can't stop obama
[02:42:16.240 --> 02:42:20.320]  because they're going to vote everybody's going to get a chance to say see we were against it i
[02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:30.080]  was against it don't be mad at me but then obama vetoed it had the corker bill not been done when
[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:37.600]  the agreement finally came out and if it does ever come out it'll be over he can't do anything about
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:42.720]  it they could stop it but now they can't stop it they don't have enough votes to override his veto
[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:46.800]  and what is the point of letting iran get nuclear weapons because i'm not just here bashing iran
[02:42:46.800 --> 02:42:52.080]  i'm on islamophobe uh but we know pakistan's handed out nukes in the in the middle east already
[02:42:52.080 --> 02:42:56.800]  we know saudi arabia's got them from my intel iran's had nukes for a while just not delivery
[02:42:56.800 --> 02:43:03.200]  systems have what is all this really about it's about destabilizing the middle east
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:12.480]  and allowing obama i know y'all going to think i'm crazy again but look at his actions not at his
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:21.520]  words please this is allowing obama to introduce himself to the world of islam is being the absolute
[02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:28.400]  leader you see for the first time you're going to be able people the islamic people in the middle
[02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:35.440]  east are going to be able to say hey obama he's our guy he has done what no other person of islam
[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:42.720]  has ever been able to do and that is to conquer the great eagle from the west now alex that's a big
[02:43:42.720 --> 02:43:48.240]  thing buddy that's a big thing and then when people say to me well all this stuff you're
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:55.360]  talking about with cuba that can't be real you're just making it up and just like you said alex
[02:43:55.360 --> 02:44:02.480]  this stuff that we're going through now is so much bigger than contras and iran hey i was in i was in
[02:44:02.480 --> 02:44:10.720]  nick rog you're talking to a guy that was actually there this is so big this is taking america down
[02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:17.440]  a road that we the bad guys could have only dreamed of back then back then if you remember alex i was
[02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:22.000]  in the middle of trying to stop something called the domino theory where communists would move up
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:28.720]  through nick rog would then it would take honduras then mexico and then here they're already here
[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:35.680]  and we have no idea alex how many of them well i'll tell you what i knew something was going on
[02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:40.880]  they always say communism doesn't exist as we adopted and then suddenly the last two years the last year
[02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:46.320]  i'll be at a restaurant or i'll be just anywhere and the communists show up in red flags and are
[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:51.200]  running around calling for killing cops right in front of me and when i've caught it on video
[02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:55.920]  and it's like suddenly they're they're coming out of their holes they're suddenly activating
[02:44:57.200 --> 02:45:05.920]  alex the other day i hear from you and a few other media that ferrican came out calling for
[02:45:05.920 --> 02:45:11.280]  10 000 brave souls to go out and kill a hundred thousand that was he talking about a hundred
[02:45:11.280 --> 02:45:16.800]  thousand white or was he talking about a hundred thousand cops i don't know but once again guys all
[02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:23.280]  i can ask is think about it alex or either one were to make loose comments like that what would
[02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:28.880]  happen to us plus we don't want to make that comment i would never make it and i know you would
[02:45:28.880 --> 02:45:33.920]  you know but but but if we did we'd be arrested because it's a cold action i'm sorry because it's
[02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:42.080]  a cold action it was and you know i'm introducing a plan i'm trying to get a plan trying to get one
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:47.120]  state to pick it up alex you and i'll talk about it all fair but basically it's a call for states
[02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:54.480]  rights if we don't have states rights now if some state one state does not stand up and declare
[02:45:55.120 --> 02:46:01.520]  you know the rights of a state to make its own laws we're lost washington's gone absolutely it's
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:06.320]  all about branding states rights as racist and getting us all fighting with each other so nobody
[02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:11.600]  can come together and fight to restore the republic from the globalist takeover and then lose ferrican
[02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:18.000]  one time plugged me like i was great when i told pierce morgan 1776 would happen if they wanted the
[02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:23.600]  guns it's almost like he's not controlled but he wants a revolution or something because we have
[02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:27.760]  the clip we just put it on screen where he did say we need to rise up and start killing people
[02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:33.360]  i mean what is ferrican looking to do i mean this is crazy does he know what's gonna happen
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:39.360]  in a race war i mean it's not gonna be pretty alex that's the whole point to all of this
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:48.160]  obama ferrican sharp and all these people are talking they know what they're doing alex this
[02:46:48.160 --> 02:46:55.760]  whole thing evolves everybody getting together and causing the race war because why because that
[02:46:55.760 --> 02:47:02.560]  creates the national crisis that allows them to cash in fema and when fema's done they're all being
[02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:08.560]  told they'll have high positions of power i'm sure but they all better look at obama's history
[02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:13.200]  when that man has gotten where he's wanted to go everybody that helped him get there he threw
[02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:19.360]  under the bus if you don't believe me ask what's your name the black lady with the tv show whatever
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:25.920]  i mean he's thrown everybody everybody under the boat bus that helped him get where he's going
[02:47:25.920 --> 02:47:31.920]  and he will do the same and for those people that say well obama's not a moslem he says he's a christian
[02:47:31.920 --> 02:47:38.960]  well he also said uh obama care you can keep your own doctor list the things that obama has said
[02:47:38.960 --> 02:47:43.200]  remember when he spoke in cairo and i'm not bashing muslims themselves but radical ones
[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:48.480]  the muslims were in rapture when he first got up they said he speaks better than an imam the the
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:59.760]  arabic and yeah i mean look i have nothing to be afraid of i'm telling you just look at obama's
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:04.560]  actions and then when he says something you better do like we used to do with clinton remember that
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:09.360]  alex we say whatever clinton said figure out what the exact opposite is and you'll know what he's
[02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:16.960]  talking about well now with obama know this when he says whatever he says it's not true so he can
[02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:26.320]  tell me all day long that he's just great christian but in fact and indeed his actions show me that we
[02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:35.280]  have a moslem fundamentalist moslem in charge of our country right now and he's leaning from within
[02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:43.280]  our country for these riots which literally take us to the ebb where we collapse well let me tell you
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:46.720]  the globalist may have been biting on more than they can chew because the military knows that
[02:48:46.720 --> 02:48:50.400]  they're being targeted the police now know they're being targeted and i told them this would come
[02:48:50.400 --> 02:48:56.880]  um what i guess the elite just can't help it though they're they're going for broke they
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:49:04.480]  they can't they you know they know what they're doing and i tell you it was november 2008 when
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:11.120]  this all ended for us you see when they did the big thing with the bailout and millions of americans
[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:16.320]  called their congressmen and senators i mean me and shut down the phones i mean shut down the
[02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:24.320]  phones it was like 90 unpopular in polls right and then six weeks later after all of those congressmen
[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:29.920]  and senators voted for it we elected them all right back in that was a day it ended that was a day
[02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:33.840]  when they knew in washington they didn't have to worry about it so they did obama care and all the
[02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:39.840]  other screw jobs and folks if you think this screw job we've been given is bad they are really getting
[02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:47.120]  out the big jack hammers now i mean oh you bet i mean they're coming after us now and they believe
[02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:53.440]  alex there's nothing we can do but that's where you are in trouble that's where you're in trouble
[02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:58.000]  that's where i'm in trouble they're a handful of people alex that are not afraid or at least
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:05.280]  don't have enough sense to be afraid we're trying to tell the truth and i know guys y'all don't have
[02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:12.400]  any idea out there listening to me you have no idea what it feels like to tell the truth about
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:18.640]  something and then have every person in the government every single person in the government
[02:50:18.640 --> 02:50:25.040]  say you're crazy and then your friends your family everybody hears that you're some nut bag out here
[02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:31.840]  well let me tell you that's a hot seat to sit in not to mention going to bed at night and wondering
[02:50:31.840 --> 02:50:37.760]  if i hear a noise outside well i hear it in time to stop somebody coming in to pop

[02:54:36.240 --> 02:54:41.840]  this little segment the next but i've forgotten that back on what june 23rd i think was the date
[02:54:41.840 --> 02:54:47.520]  i'll put it on screen um was reported on in august that lewis ferrican came out it's talked
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:53.920]  about going out and stalking and killing people stalk them and kill them ferrican says calling
[02:54:53.920 --> 02:55:01.280]  10 000 volunteers to kill whites and then you notice the new black panther party said yesterday
[02:55:01.280 --> 02:55:07.120]  we're gonna stalk you in the dark and kill you and i don't get how cops can follow orders to
[02:55:07.120 --> 02:55:13.280]  fire tear gas and peaceful reporters and act like they hate us and then people walk around saying
[02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:16.320]  i'm gonna kill you i mean if somebody was walking around in front of me saying i'm gonna kill you i
[02:55:16.320 --> 02:55:23.440]  go i mean it's just crazy and it's exactly what uh larry nickles was just saying this is authorized
[02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:30.960]  so i don't know what's going on with uh lewis ferrican i mean some of what he says i like
[02:55:30.960 --> 02:55:36.240]  some of that i don't but i mean this is reckless and dangerous i mean this is charlie manson stuff
[02:55:36.880 --> 02:55:43.680]  telling his group go out and kill people plus black people are 12 of the population 13 most
[02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:49.440]  of them aren't horrible murdering killers let's say two percent of black males or your two percent
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:54.000]  of black population have which is male let's say a third of the black males is about two three percent
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.720]  go out and start a shooting war is they're gonna be destroyed
[02:55:56.720 --> 02:56:02.560]  but i guess that's what the globalists want they already aborted half the blacks
[02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:09.200]  man this is mind control folks this is evil and either ferrican's gone crazy or he's working
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:13.760]  for the new world order because uh you know this is just crazy let's go this club
[02:56:16.320 --> 02:56:18.400]  so if the federal government
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:31.440]  will not intercede in our affairs then we must rise up and kill those who kill us
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:41.360]  stop them and kill them and let them feel the pain of death that we are feeling
[02:56:41.360 --> 02:56:50.640]  i'm not going to even play it again i gotta go to phone calls but i'd not forgotten about that
[02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:57.440]  it's just these people are going out and killing cops and other people and beating up white people
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:57:03.040]  in neighborhoods for no reason because lewis ferrican said this and lewis ferrican is
[02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:08.880]  putting the same stuff out as the white house and george soros and ferrican looks completely crazy
[02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:16.080]  there like he's bought ferrican when i talked about 1776 they take the guns he loved it so i
[02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:25.120]  think ferrican actually wants to have a big war and when i said 1776 i meant if you come for the
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:30.960]  guns like lexington and concord is gonna start not go out and stop people and kill them uh
[02:57:30.960 --> 02:57:35.280]  what do you make of this larry nickles and then we're going to these callers well number one
[02:57:35.280 --> 02:57:42.880]  and they are i mean this is not accidental alex if it were accidental if they didn't want it don't
[02:57:42.880 --> 02:57:48.240]  you know they can make one phone call have the federal government go arrest him shut him down
[02:57:48.240 --> 02:57:53.120]  and nobody would make these kind of comments ever the folks would say then his followers the millions
[02:57:53.120 --> 02:57:57.920]  would would riot but that's not true the globals know how to kill him with a microwave gun across
[02:57:57.920 --> 02:58:03.280]  the street they'll cook him in his bedroom if they want if they wanted him shut up i assure you
[02:58:03.280 --> 02:58:07.920]  not much on this earth i know but he would be shut up so if somebody is not being shut up
[02:58:07.920 --> 02:58:15.280]  then you and i can only only realize that they want it out and look i know it doesn't sound
[02:58:15.280 --> 02:58:22.240]  right and i know there are millions and millions of black way this kind of attitude nor would they
[02:58:22.240 --> 02:58:28.640]  endorse or even want this kind of attitude but you better wake up now guys i'm telling this

[03:03:06.240 --> 03:03:10.640]  i mean there are some phantoms there and i'm thinking that's why they've got the lockdown
[03:03:10.640 --> 03:03:18.880]  is to prevent it from spreading out anywhere else in that area so it's you know the whole
[03:03:18.880 --> 03:03:24.080]  thing is ridiculous well it ends up being racially motivated i hope msnbc and lois faircon are happy

[03:03:41.680 --> 03:03:45.280]  that's the thing is it seems like the establishment doesn't even care if we know
[03:03:45.280 --> 03:03:50.320]  they're just going ahead with it as a cover story yeah you know alex it's something that
[03:03:50.320 --> 03:03:55.440]  we did back when i was with clinton we cleverly called it instead of brainwashing we called it
[03:03:55.440 --> 03:04:00.640]  social engineering and that's what we're that's what's happening to us and it's really happening
[03:04:00.640 --> 03:04:05.360]  to our youth now folks i'm gonna tell you look at what they're doing with our words they're fixing
[03:04:05.360 --> 03:04:11.200]  it to where half the stuff in our language we can't say but alex if you look at the words they exclude
[03:04:12.080 --> 03:04:20.000]  they all connect to the takeover of our country they're words that would if we still have those
[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:26.560]  words in our vocabulary than our young know from where we came and they're a race and where we
[03:04:26.560 --> 03:04:31.760]  came that's why they're getting rid of boy and girl father and mother this is a cult takeover
[03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:37.760]  it is and alex you know i i've got to say this about the video that you did sure about the

[03:08:36.320 --> 03:08:43.120]  he is actually listening to the police scanner audio of what's going on up in illinois just north
[03:08:43.120 --> 03:08:56.320]  of chicago right and so what i'm looking at now actually somebody just sent me this i get a lot
[03:08:56.320 --> 03:09:01.920]  of emails from our tipsters this one came from glenn and the article it's from the san antonio
[03:09:01.920 --> 03:09:06.080]  express news video shows san antonio man shot by sheriff's deputies while his hands are up
[03:09:06.800 --> 03:09:10.480]  and we're going to go to show you some of this video i don't know if this will end up making it
[03:09:10.480 --> 03:09:15.520]  on youtube the the sensors they're going crazy anytime you show any type of uh any time we show
[03:09:15.520 --> 03:09:20.640]  it right yeah it's it's it's bad but you can go on actually find the there's there's a suicide
[03:09:20.640 --> 03:09:25.520]  video of a guy who who he was a congressman named bud Dwyer and from the state of pennsylvania who
[03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:30.560]  was caught in this corruption stuff he shoots himself in the head on live during a news conference
[03:09:30.560 --> 03:09:34.960]  and that video is still on youtube and it's graphic more graphic than anything we've ever shown
[03:09:34.960 --> 03:09:39.200]  but let's go back to this uh this article video shows san antonio man shot by sheriff's deputies
[03:09:39.200 --> 03:09:44.560]  while his hands are up uh video published in its entirety shows two bexar county uh deputies
[03:09:44.560 --> 03:09:48.560]  opening fire and killing a man who appears to be standing still with his hands up now i watched
[03:09:48.560 --> 03:09:52.800]  some of this video that we're going to roll real quick go go and pull that video back up and show
[03:09:52.800 --> 03:09:58.000]  that that was from k sat and uh the video there is from michael toms you can see this guy kind of
[03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:02.960]  walking around before he was over near his house now the deputies are coming out to talk to him
[03:10:02.960 --> 03:10:07.200]  the guy shooting this in his cell phone moves into a little bit better uh location but you can
[03:10:07.200 --> 03:10:13.920]  clearly see it's like there's hands are up and boom he is shot right there on the spot hands are
[03:10:13.920 --> 03:10:20.240]  up the guy is not moving now this the guy doesn't appear to be black african-american i think somebody
[03:10:20.240 --> 03:10:26.080]  said he was hispanic uh they i'm not sure if they've released his name yet in these two articles they
[03:10:26.960 --> 03:10:30.800]  actually gilbert floris is his name 41 year old suspect was shot outside his home
[03:10:31.360 --> 03:10:38.640]  on the uh 2400 24 000 block of walnut pass but you know talking about this racial issue which
[03:10:38.640 --> 03:10:43.280]  you have racial issues do exist but i'm reminded of that video from a few months ago i can't remember
[03:10:43.280 --> 03:10:48.320]  what city it was but it was two black men in a vehicle they're pulled over by a black officer
[03:10:48.320 --> 03:10:52.560]  one of the guys gets out the vehicle with his hands up and gets shot yeah by the cop yeah you
[03:10:52.560 --> 03:10:56.640]  know so they always say some racial they'll know it you can just encounter a police officer of any
[03:10:56.640 --> 03:11:03.040]  color the deputies gregg vasquez and robert sanchez so it looks like they're all hispanic um
[03:11:03.040 --> 03:11:08.560]  you know so there won't be any protests and burnings in san antonio over this but the guy
[03:11:08.560 --> 03:11:12.800]  clearly had his hands up i mean that is definitely something that's going to be and it needs to be
[03:11:12.800 --> 03:11:16.960]  investigated we need to let the rule of law take place and if it comes out that these guys are
[03:11:16.960 --> 03:11:21.200]  exonerated um you know i don't know what's going to happen then but that is clearly that's the
[03:11:21.200 --> 03:11:26.000]  reason why we have these issues you know right going back to uh kelly thomas out in california
[03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:30.000]  you know the guy was beaten to death you know he's a white guy beaten to death on camera over the
[03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:34.000]  course of 20 minutes and then we hear all this jargon how we need body cameras like we have
[03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:37.760]  this on video why don't you do something about it and then i heard something about like one of
[03:11:37.760 --> 03:11:41.520]  the officers once it's cc's pizza and he got kicked out that's probably the worst thing that happened
[03:11:41.520 --> 03:11:45.920]  to him he didn't serve any time in jail right well and and it was a gun thing they said they
[03:11:45.920 --> 03:11:50.160]  didn't like him open carrying his uh his firearm which is ridiculous you would think you would want
[03:11:50.160 --> 03:11:53.840]  a police officer at your establishment in case something were ever to happen
[03:11:54.400 --> 03:11:59.920]  now i want to go to a quick report by joe bigs he's actually monitoring the stuff as i said on
[03:12:00.560 --> 03:12:05.200]  police scanner at this time so let's roll that and then joe's going to be joining us at the
[03:12:05.200 --> 03:12:08.720]  bottom of the hour we've got hillary clinton news we've got all kind of stuff we're going to be doing
[03:12:08.720 --> 03:12:12.560]  the fourth hour here for i guess the rest of our lives we're going to be doing that fourth hour
[03:12:12.560 --> 03:12:19.440]  live so i'm looking forward to it i love it let's roll that report
[03:12:24.320 --> 03:12:30.400]  joe bigs here with info wars dot com now there's currently a manhunt underway in fox lake illinois
[03:12:30.400 --> 03:12:37.360]  for three suspected cop killers now right around eight a.m this morning a fox lake police officers
[03:12:37.360 --> 03:12:43.920]  was shot and killed and now there's this huge massive manhunt much like in watertown massachusetts
[03:12:43.920 --> 03:12:49.680]  that happened with the boston bombings there's reports of police going door to door looking for
[03:12:49.680 --> 03:12:56.160]  these suspects and essentially the entire area of fox lake is on lockdown including schools
[03:12:56.160 --> 03:13:02.240]  and other businesses as well now the officer was pursuing people described as suspicious around eight
[03:13:02.240 --> 03:13:08.240]  a.m. tuesday according to lake county under sheriff raymond rose officers responding to the
[03:13:08.240 --> 03:13:13.200]  scene to help the officer found him in a marshy area stripped of his gun and other equipment
[03:13:13.200 --> 03:13:20.800]  and the officer has died on the scene now the police have just established a perimeter in that area
[03:13:20.800 --> 03:13:28.000]  trying to look for the one black male and two white males who are the suspects in this shooting
[03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:32.400]  police with the help of us marshals were searching woods and businesses in the area
[03:13:32.960 --> 03:13:37.680]  authorities said now police released a statement saying that if residents see anybody in the area
[03:13:37.680 --> 03:13:43.360]  that doesn't belong or doesn't look right they should call 911 and report them the search prompted
[03:13:43.360 --> 03:13:47.760]  officials at grant community high school to put their building on lockdown grant community high
[03:13:47.760 --> 03:13:53.520]  school is currently in a lockdown at the request of the fox lake police department now this killing
[03:13:53.520 --> 03:13:59.760]  of a police officer comes two days after a police officer was killed in the houston area at a cypress
[03:13:59.760 --> 03:14:07.280]  gas station officer go forth was executed by a lone gunman now there have been numerous cop
[03:14:07.280 --> 03:14:12.000]  killings that have happened in louisiana too over the last few months so what's going on what's
[03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:16.640]  prompting this this is something that we're going to continue to keep an eye on because this is a
[03:14:16.640 --> 03:14:21.680]  story that is unfolding it's still going on i've got my police scanner out we're going to be listening
[03:14:21.680 --> 03:14:29.360]  for updates and we'll keep you guys informed stay tuned at info wars dot com there you go that was
[03:14:29.360 --> 03:14:34.640]  joe biggs and he's going to be here at the bottom of the hour at two thirty central and joining us
[03:14:34.640 --> 03:14:38.800]  to talk about any new developments that might might have happened yeah and when we talk about
[03:14:38.800 --> 03:14:42.720]  these police shootings we had a chance to talk about this a little bit more and uh and overdrive
[03:14:42.720 --> 03:14:46.960]  the other day when you have uh these continuous things we already see the police out there they
[03:14:46.960 --> 03:14:51.040]  have m wraps and the heavy armor and all these other armaments this is just giving them more
[03:14:51.040 --> 03:14:55.360]  purpose or you see this you see that we need more of this stuff and then it could get to the point
[03:14:55.360 --> 03:14:59.600]  whether you're a standard patrol car is a m wrap it's a self-fulfilling prophecy and this is something
[03:14:59.600 --> 03:15:05.920]  that we've been documenting uh even before i got here i got here in 2009 one of the first big uh
[03:15:05.920 --> 03:15:11.600]  trips i went on was the uh g20 going on in Pittsburgh and there were m wraps everywhere they
[03:15:11.600 --> 03:15:15.760]  started uh hitting everybody with the sound cannon and it was the first time the sound cannon had
[03:15:15.760 --> 03:15:19.840]  been used on american citizens and now it's not no big deal we got sound cannons we got used in
[03:15:19.840 --> 03:15:26.320]  Ferguson you know every place else exactly and they these it's it's incidents like these that give
[03:15:26.320 --> 03:15:32.640]  them the excuse to want to ramp up uh they're you know they're arsenal yeah and it's uh it's
[03:15:32.640 --> 03:15:37.440]  really it's really disturbing to see it go in that direction but also at at at the same time
[03:15:37.440 --> 03:15:43.280]  you know the cop killings are going to get hyped up on the news uh shootings like like this other
[03:15:43.280 --> 03:15:47.680]  one of this man in san Antonio are going to get hyped up i think this just hit the wire uh about
[03:15:47.680 --> 03:15:53.440]  four hours ago when they finally released it looks like they released a video on uh updated it on
[03:15:53.440 --> 03:16:01.120]  august 31st at 11 o'clock that night so you have all these incidents it's really setting the stage
[03:16:01.120 --> 03:16:05.840]  for a an internal civil war here in the united states and it's going to be people versus the
[03:16:05.840 --> 03:16:12.480]  establishment and i i think i don't know where where's the average citizen gonna fall in in this
[03:16:12.480 --> 03:16:18.080]  mess and that's what i'm worried about i'm ready to defend my family and i hope other people out
[03:16:18.080 --> 03:16:22.000]  there are ready to defend their families if it comes to that but obviously we don't want it to
[03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:25.840]  come to that there's so many other things we could be working towards instead of shooting each other
[03:16:25.840 --> 03:16:30.800]  that's right just like we had uh mr pitman on the show yesterday who is a candidate for chef down in
[03:16:30.800 --> 03:16:34.240]  the houston area and we were asking them these questions that we're talking about now and he
[03:16:34.240 --> 03:16:38.560]  said i want to make sure that it doesn't get to that point in houston you know we want and that's
[03:16:38.560 --> 03:16:43.520]  what we need to have we need to have more community togetherness i think a great example that was uh
[03:16:43.520 --> 03:16:48.240]  in charleston when i was down there you know we've seen all the things in ferguson and baltimore
[03:16:48.240 --> 03:16:53.520]  and cleveland and everyplace else but i get out to charleston and it's you know police they're out
[03:16:53.520 --> 03:16:57.600]  there but they're not out there in the m reps they don't have guns aimed at people they're just
[03:16:57.600 --> 03:17:01.280]  interacting with the crowd and you know i think the worst thing that happened while i was out there
[03:17:01.280 --> 03:17:05.040]  was you know just some minor graffiti or something like that it was no big deal
[03:17:05.040 --> 03:17:09.680]  really after it happened it was a horrible tragedy but the way people reacted to it was a very positive
[03:17:09.680 --> 03:17:14.320]  way and hopefully we can see more that going on around the country well and these incidents are
[03:17:15.040 --> 03:17:18.640]  having them being brought out like this is making people stand up and talk about it at
[03:17:18.640 --> 03:17:24.000]  least pick a side and you you find out who's on the side of law and order and who's on the side of
[03:17:24.000 --> 03:17:30.640]  you know chaos and murder and degradation because we do have to get beyond it seems like we haven't
[03:17:30.640 --> 03:17:36.960]  made i think since 9 11 our country has really not progressed any in any direction like it should
[03:17:36.960 --> 03:17:42.320]  we've we've we've stagnated for 10 years after 9 11 under under george busher i guess they ate
[03:17:42.320 --> 03:17:46.480]  eight and a half seven and a half years after george bush now though bomba race relations have
[03:17:46.480 --> 03:17:52.960]  gone down just as the police state is ramping up and it started you know it started before bush
[03:17:52.960 --> 03:17:57.280]  but he really ramped it up with the creation of homeland security yeah and we've seen
[03:17:57.280 --> 03:18:02.640]  various people come out uh sheriff clark many others coming after you know the obama administration
[03:18:02.640 --> 03:18:08.240]  eric holder these people you know al sharp and whoever else for kind of ratcheting up this rhetoric
[03:18:08.240 --> 03:18:12.160]  and of course we do want to talk about this stuff we don't want to sweep it on the rug and acts like
[03:18:12.160 --> 03:18:18.880]  act like it didn't happen but when you have people who are so have such a concerted effort
[03:18:18.880 --> 03:18:23.120]  to hype these racial situation but then again they ignore things like what happened to kelly thomas
[03:18:23.120 --> 03:18:26.960]  and many other people that you know people don't know the names of they're not as famous as a
[03:18:26.960 --> 03:18:32.240]  michael brown or eric garner but they were they encountered the police in a very violent situation
[03:18:32.240 --> 03:18:36.080]  nonetheless yeah and you know it's like what sheriff clark said the other day he's like i don't
[03:18:36.080 --> 03:18:40.560]  like people using the qualifier there's some bad cops you know he wants to take the stance of a
[03:18:40.560 --> 03:18:45.760]  vanguard and that cops it seems like he's saying cops can do no wrong which i think you know if you
[03:18:45.760 --> 03:18:49.680]  do bad things you should be prosecuted oh absolutely you know you shouldn't be able to because you
[03:18:49.680 --> 03:18:53.920]  have a shield you get a free pass especially when you do something wrong and it's and it's caught on
[03:18:53.920 --> 03:18:57.760]  tape because a lot of these incidences don't get caught on tape and now it's it's finally starting
[03:18:57.760 --> 03:19:02.400]  to happen because people have uh you know cell phones are ubiquitous um can we go to a couple

[03:26:58.640 --> 03:27:03.120]  hey mike finish up your story uh what you were talking about with why you like uh tuning into
[03:27:03.120 --> 03:27:08.320]  the alex jones show yeah it definitely validates a lot of things that i've already perceived you
[03:27:08.320 --> 03:27:12.720]  know as a foster kid and then later as an advocate for other foster children i had a front row seat
[03:27:12.720 --> 03:27:18.080]  in the 90s of how not only they profiteer off of the foster care system you know financially but
[03:27:18.080 --> 03:27:24.000]  how it becomes like a uh a foster kids become like a pool of uh people that the government
[03:27:24.000 --> 03:27:29.040]  can medically experiment on and so as a from a young age i realized who had you know how
[03:27:29.040 --> 03:27:33.520]  tyrants behave and it's given me a lot of insight and so when i talk about the bottom of the rabbit
[03:27:33.520 --> 03:27:38.320]  hole um i just the point i want to make is that the people who populate this thing that we call
[03:27:38.320 --> 03:27:42.480]  the new world order are whether you know whether they're a petty beer chatter all the people like
[03:27:42.480 --> 03:27:46.960]  the clintons you know what it is is that these people don't have a spiritual or emotional connection
[03:27:46.960 --> 03:27:51.120]  with the world around them and this is you know the source of their strength but it's also their
[03:27:51.120 --> 03:27:56.320]  greatest weakness and i almost think that we don't need to necessarily fight offensively so much
[03:27:56.320 --> 03:28:00.000]  against the new world order rather than just sort of stand back and let these people destroy
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:04.320]  themselves while doing our best to like provide for common self defense amongst all of us who love
[03:28:04.320 --> 03:28:09.200]  liberty and want to protect that um so yeah that was basically the point the bottom of the rabbit
[03:28:09.200 --> 03:28:13.120]  hole is people who you know they have no connection with the world around them and they come up with
[03:28:13.120 --> 03:28:16.720]  all these delusional plans about how they're going to control and manipulate and hurt other people
[03:28:16.720 --> 03:28:22.880]  but in the end their blind spot is that they don't realize that you know they're on disconnection
[03:28:22.880 --> 03:28:27.440]  from the world is their own and yeah they are the source of their own uh down bringing essentially
[03:28:27.440 --> 03:28:31.600]  now let me ask you this were you ever prescribed uh a psychotropic drugs while you're in cps
[03:28:32.800 --> 03:28:39.840]  my goodness um you know not only was i prescribed several others it is it's it's just a horrific
[03:28:39.840 --> 03:28:45.840]  story um i've pretty much been on all the different ones that they had out and you know you have
[03:28:45.840 --> 03:28:51.600]  psychiatrists who just are constantly changing what they say your diagnosis is and constantly
[03:28:51.600 --> 03:28:56.240]  prescribing new medications and i from my perspective as i grew up and became an adult and look back
[03:28:56.240 --> 03:29:01.600]  into this from that perspective i realized what they're really doing it was doing you know
[03:29:01.600 --> 03:29:07.600]  test research to see you know how these medications really did affect people as far as psychologically
[03:29:07.600 --> 03:29:12.720]  and health wise and that um yeah you were being again essentially i was on actually a lot of
[03:29:12.720 --> 03:29:17.920]  the pills i was on actually later on there was huge lawsuits over you know how they should never
[03:29:17.920 --> 03:29:22.800]  have been prescribed to adolescents and stuff so there's just this huge dark underbelly in the
[03:29:22.800 --> 03:29:27.360]  farm industry but it you know it's just a little it's like Alex Jones calls things a rosetta stone
[03:29:27.360 --> 03:29:32.720]  to understand things with you know yeah totally agree mike thank you for sharing that story that
[03:29:32.720 --> 03:29:38.080]  is truly awful the way cps treats people especially young children as guinea pigs now we're gonna be
[03:29:38.080 --> 03:29:42.240]  right back with uh more calls joe biggs is gonna come in give us in some more updates on this uh

[03:33:22.480 --> 03:33:27.360]  show today this is the live fourth hour of the alex jones show i'm your host rob do writing
[03:33:27.360 --> 03:33:32.880]  shotguns jacari jackson we also have joe bigs joe's gonna give us some updates on the shooting in
[03:33:32.880 --> 03:33:38.480]  fox lake joe you were listening in on the police scanner what is going on there so there's a lot
[03:33:38.480 --> 03:33:42.560]  of stuff going on they have essentially the entire town on lockdown like martial law they've
[03:33:42.560 --> 03:33:47.120]  got the whole area the the schools local schools are shut down and uh from what i've been hearing
[03:33:47.120 --> 03:33:52.000]  on the police scanner the police are going into neighborhoods they're scanning and looking at the
[03:33:52.000 --> 03:33:56.240]  license plates and then matching it with the address on the registration to see if that vehicle
[03:33:56.240 --> 03:34:00.480]  belongs in that driveway and then from there they're going in and looking at the homes there's
[03:34:00.480 --> 03:34:04.720]  nothing or willing about that negative i mean that that's there that's what's supposed to happen
[03:34:04.720 --> 03:34:10.000]  so it's much like we like you mentioned earlier what we saw in watertown massachusetts with the
[03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:15.200]  boss and bombing the door to door searching going through and all that so if you live in fox
[03:34:15.200 --> 03:34:18.320]  lake and you might have a warrant out there and you have nothing to do with this it's probably
[03:34:18.320 --> 03:34:21.840]  not going to be a safe place for you to be today anybody out there you got to think anyone out
[03:34:21.840 --> 03:34:26.560]  there who's been laying low under the radar it's all going to come to light today yeah boy that is
[03:34:26.560 --> 03:34:30.560]  definitely a crazy situation that's pretty unprecedented that they would scan the license
[03:34:30.560 --> 03:34:34.480]  plate i mean there's no flies on yeah if you go and drop your kids off at the babysitter you know
[03:34:34.480 --> 03:34:38.400]  you just happen to be in the driveway at that time yeah come oh yeah there's a lot of there's a lot
[03:34:38.400 --> 03:34:42.480]  of different instances they're not playing around atf just tweeted out that they've arrived on scene
[03:34:42.480 --> 03:34:47.840]  so the atf there us marshals as well a swat team local police department all the police
[03:34:47.840 --> 03:34:51.520]  departments in that area the different counties have come together and kind of help in this surge
[03:34:51.520 --> 03:34:56.400]  they were the helicopters are in the air uh the guys are in the full uh riot gear like we saw in
[03:34:56.400 --> 03:35:01.920]  Ferguson the guys in the green you know so the same thing everything's it's a very tense situation
[03:35:02.480 --> 03:35:07.200]  i'd be surprised if they catch these people tonight but for sure probably by tomorrow morning you
[03:35:07.200 --> 03:35:10.880]  got to think after these guys three people trying to stay together running from the cops are going to
[03:35:10.880 --> 03:35:15.920]  get tired uh we'll see what happens they don't get sloppy then eventually get caught because this
[03:35:15.920 --> 03:35:20.240]  is something that i don't think was planned out like hueson was an execution this guy was on the
[03:35:20.240 --> 03:35:26.880]  hunt for a lone cop he found them shot him killed him this happened to be a situation around 8 a.m
[03:35:26.880 --> 03:35:32.320]  the cops saw a vehicle was acting suspicious the people inside he pulled him over called for backup
[03:35:32.320 --> 03:35:36.160]  and uh i just found out too earlier that the cops were so close trying to get to him they could
[03:35:36.160 --> 03:35:41.280]  actually hear the gunfire happen when he was shot they found him dead in a marsh with his gun missing
[03:35:41.280 --> 03:35:46.080]  and uh uh pepper spray and maybe some other equipment you know handcuffs tasers whatever
[03:35:46.080 --> 03:35:51.040]  he had on him so that's all been taken so that's currently going on right now wow and you also
[03:35:51.040 --> 03:35:57.120]  mentioned there was a an instance where a female cop had seen blood in an abandoned car and what
[03:35:57.120 --> 03:36:02.640]  what they they they they saw uh i think it was like an abandoned house and there was a suv park
[03:36:02.640 --> 03:36:08.560]  there was a red suv and she went in by herself looking around and saw drops of blood and then
[03:36:08.560 --> 03:36:12.400]  another police officer eventually showed up and i'm sitting here like watching a horror movie like
[03:36:12.400 --> 03:36:16.240]  hey lady don't go in there by yourself what are you doing what are you doing so it's definitely
[03:36:16.240 --> 03:36:19.680]  intense i and i advise people if you got a police scanner listen to what's going on
[03:36:20.640 --> 03:36:24.800]  yeah it's still legal to do at this point um but i'm sure they will soon eventually
[03:36:25.440 --> 03:36:29.520]  cut that off here's an interesting story out of the new york times and this is um
[03:36:30.080 --> 03:36:34.800]  in budapest right now in hungary they're having this seems to be like the thoroughfare for all
[03:36:34.800 --> 03:36:40.720]  the immigrants who are coming from africa in the middle east they go through budapest to get to western
[03:36:40.720 --> 03:36:45.760]  europe and basically the train station has now cut off service to the migrants amid the crisis and
[03:36:45.760 --> 03:36:50.720]  the migrants are protesting they want their free ride into western europe a lot of them are going
[03:36:50.720 --> 03:36:55.520]  into germany and then they're going into camps they're being set up in these relocation camps
[03:36:55.520 --> 03:36:59.520]  where they can do all the uh the paperwork to find out if they're going to get asylum or not
[03:36:59.520 --> 03:37:03.200]  i'm kind of like the little camps they set up uh during the whole Ebola scare with the uh
[03:37:03.200 --> 03:37:06.960]  immigration influx that happened last summer all these different places were popping up they were
[03:37:06.960 --> 03:37:12.400]  buying those old hotels they were setting up these FEMA camp type things buying prisons and all that
[03:37:12.400 --> 03:37:16.640]  and then holding them in there you know on our dollar but it's funny because donald trump comes
[03:37:16.640 --> 03:37:22.400]  out and says you know that everyone coming from mexico over in here is a a murder a killer rapist
[03:37:22.400 --> 03:37:27.040]  a criminal of some sort and that uh the fact that donald trump wants to build this uh wall
[03:37:27.040 --> 03:37:32.080]  is racist but if you look at the southern border of mexico they have a giant wall that goes across
[03:37:32.080 --> 03:37:37.200]  they think that the wall is a good idea too so i think that's kind of uh a little bit out there yeah
[03:37:37.200 --> 03:37:42.240]  and well i think there's a lot of i don't know if he said everybody is but i don't i think there's
[03:37:42.240 --> 03:37:47.280]  better ways to patrol that area than using a wall i think we have the technology the autonomous drone
[03:37:47.280 --> 03:37:51.760]  that glenn spencer came up with the seismic technology that could be exactly exactly since
[03:37:51.760 --> 03:37:56.880]  someone coming through oh i i see someone coming through the studio right now alex
[03:37:56.880 --> 03:38:03.040]  i need a fourth microphone in here no i actually came in here yep get my cell phone i gave it to
[03:38:03.040 --> 03:38:07.600]  one of the guys sure good good good good your keys are uh anthony's office right i got my crap
[03:38:07.600 --> 03:38:13.120]  everywhere no no no i just watched the video that i'm going to perch on on the jacari shoulder right
[03:38:13.120 --> 03:38:18.080]  here i just came and watched the video and um darin mcbreen isn't there blowing it up yeah
[03:38:18.080 --> 03:38:23.120]  of the shooting in san Antonio and i was reading they never charged those cops this went on a while
[03:38:23.120 --> 03:38:29.680]  ago i'm glad the station released it those that cop executes that guy that had done nothing yeah
[03:38:29.680 --> 03:38:34.480]  with his hands up this is why people are angry just like i'm angry if you execute a cop
[03:38:34.480 --> 03:38:40.240]  or if you execute you know a pop belly guy down in san antonio this is crazy it works both ways
[03:38:40.240 --> 03:38:45.200]  let me be on here but that's what people are so upset about but we can't let the globalist
[03:38:45.200 --> 03:38:51.360]  channel that into an explosion but at the same time man that is just insane well they came out
[03:38:51.360 --> 03:38:54.640]  early you know and said the whole hands up don't shoot thing was a lie with michael brown so now i
[03:38:54.640 --> 03:38:58.800]  guess they have something they can actually say and use but i wonder if i was hands up we're gonna
[03:38:58.800 --> 03:39:03.760]  shoot but i mean the guy's hands he said they're still yeah still move but his hands are up and
[03:39:03.760 --> 03:39:08.400]  they kill him in the cops like a still big deal right he's blowing the video up right now okay uh
[03:39:08.400 --> 03:39:12.080]  but yeah we're gonna have it tonight on they're trying to get this video taken down well the
[03:39:12.080 --> 03:39:15.280]  police department's put an announcement out of the sheriff's department they're trying to get this
[03:39:15.280 --> 03:39:18.720]  pulled right i gotta try to report it and flag it on everyone's site that has it up it's ridiculous
[03:39:18.720 --> 03:39:22.000]  that's what they're doing they they have troll armies now that they're they're running out there
[03:39:22.000 --> 03:39:25.840]  and if you put anything up that the establishment doesn't like they sit there and say this violates
[03:39:25.840 --> 03:39:30.960]  community guidelines i feel offended by this just because we're not for executing police we're not
[03:39:30.960 --> 03:39:36.000]  for a war with police we also don't support the police being an armed gang of thugs and that's
[03:39:36.000 --> 03:39:40.080]  what we talked about how this is a self-fulfilling prophecy anytime a cop gets shot and they start
[03:39:40.080 --> 03:39:45.120]  rolling out this martial law scenario this just so see we need this we need tanks we have to have
[03:39:45.120 --> 03:39:49.200]  this apparatus that's what the criminals don't understand the more and more they do this stuff
[03:39:49.200 --> 03:39:52.320]  the more and more these guys are going to be put their security oh yeah like you said there's going
[03:39:52.320 --> 03:39:57.680]  to be an m-wrap on every corner versus uh you know a ford uh torus whatever they have it's not going
[03:39:57.680 --> 03:40:02.880]  to be about protected service to be pure revenue generation exactly because they have to put gas
[03:40:02.880 --> 03:40:09.280]  in these giant m-wraps oh it's a very expensive too and i just read uh city of chicago is suing
[03:40:09.280 --> 03:40:14.160]  their red light camera maker that they bought the cameras from and set up to revenue generate
[03:40:14.160 --> 03:40:18.160]  because they don't work and people weren't paying their tickets so now they're suing that company
[03:40:18.160 --> 03:40:22.880]  for 300 million which i kind of feel bad for the company because it's all unlawful oh it is
[03:40:23.920 --> 03:40:28.160]  exactly there has to be a witness red lights yeah yeah oh totally oh yeah whenever i get
[03:40:28.160 --> 03:40:31.680]  something that i throw in the trash can and say see me in court i'm not going to do that i'm not
[03:40:31.680 --> 03:40:36.720]  paying that yeah but what you have though you have a company who says we have a need there's a need
[03:40:36.720 --> 03:40:40.800]  for these red light cameras which there really isn't but they make it the city goes after because
[03:40:40.800 --> 03:40:46.080]  they're so greedy and they want to have they're like we want to have uh all this revenue so we're
[03:40:46.080 --> 03:40:50.960]  just going to put them up everywhere and just screw people over and then when people revolt and say
[03:40:50.960 --> 03:40:54.320]  you know hey we're pushing the cameras we're putting Easter eggs on top of the cameras we're not
[03:40:54.320 --> 03:40:59.040]  going to pay the tickets well then they go wait a minute we spent a ton of money on this and now
[03:40:59.040 --> 03:41:03.520]  it's not reaping the benefits now they have to send guys out to actually monitor the red light
[03:41:03.520 --> 03:41:07.840]  cameras yeah exactly and so now they're mad so they want to go sue the people that they made
[03:41:07.840 --> 03:41:13.040]  they signed the contract with it's it's ridiculous don't put them up in the first place it totally
[03:41:13.040 --> 03:41:16.400]  it totally pisses me off now here's another story out of the new york times turkey arrests
[03:41:16.400 --> 03:41:22.080]  three vice news journalists on terrorism charges this just came out today uh the three journalists
[03:41:22.080 --> 03:41:26.480]  for vice news have been formally arrested in southeast turkey in charge with aiding a terrorist
[03:41:26.480 --> 03:41:30.320]  organization four days after they were retained detained while covering the conflict between
[03:41:30.320 --> 03:41:34.960]  Kurdish separatist and the turkish state so i guess they're covering both sides of the story
[03:41:34.960 --> 03:41:38.560]  well that's the tears don't like right there let me tell you the turks will come down hard on you
[03:41:38.560 --> 03:41:45.120]  there's some uh builderberg old builderberg footage i think from 2006 or 2007 of uh of
[03:41:45.120 --> 03:41:48.640]  jim tucker getting harassed by the turks and i mean that those are people you don't want to mess
[03:41:48.640 --> 03:41:54.240]  with there remind me somewhat of uh was it uh amber lion when she went out to Bahrain and she was
[03:41:54.240 --> 03:41:59.040]  documenting what was going on out there then they essentially detained her and gave her a very uh
[03:41:59.600 --> 03:42:03.360]  limited view like we'll drive you around to the places where we want you to go and see what we
[03:42:03.360 --> 03:42:07.520]  want you to see look here's a mall everybody's happy yeah nobody looks like a north korea when
[03:42:07.520 --> 03:42:11.200]  you go in they if they allow you to come in they have like this whole area set up they're like
[03:42:11.200 --> 03:42:17.520]  looks nice but really on the outskirts it's just horrendous poverty people have no food yeah and
[03:42:17.520 --> 03:42:21.840]  this is just another another exercise of how they want to control the narrative um you know and the
[03:42:21.840 --> 03:42:26.720]  turks are definitely i think can be implicated in in giving these missiles and this whole missile
[03:42:26.720 --> 03:42:31.520]  deal with Benghazi giving missiles to isis you know now how does isis come up with missiles on
[03:42:31.520 --> 03:42:36.720]  their own they're not building weapons they get a grenades airdrop to them you know courtesy of
[03:42:36.720 --> 03:42:41.600]  western governments yeah no it's ridiculous hey i want to i want to change gears here and get into
[03:42:41.600 --> 03:42:48.400]  clinton now that um people uh larry larry nickles was talking about clinton today how he thinks that
[03:42:48.400 --> 03:42:52.720]  when this stuff goes to trial she'll want to use the emails she'll say hey i want to use my emails
[03:42:52.720 --> 03:42:56.640]  as evidence they'll say no it's classified can't do it we're going to throw the whole case out
[03:42:56.640 --> 03:43:03.040]  and which is is i could see the clinton's doing this uh i covered this last night on the nightly
[03:43:03.040 --> 03:43:08.160]  news it this is from breitbart exclusive hillary shared an email network with the clinton foundation
[03:43:08.160 --> 03:43:13.280]  so her server at her house she had her personal emails the clinton mail dot com but they also
[03:43:13.280 --> 03:43:17.200]  had president clinton dot com which was part of the clinton foundation so everybody was using
[03:43:17.200 --> 03:43:23.520]  that server and can you imagine all the people working for the clinton foundation you know hitting
[03:43:23.520 --> 03:43:29.680]  a fishing scam or something and then that allows access to people to look at state department emails
[03:43:29.680 --> 03:43:35.840]  i don't understand how anybody in their right mind in america can still go out and support
[03:43:35.840 --> 03:43:41.040]  this woman with everything that comes out on a daily basis people show up to her campaigns
[03:43:41.760 --> 03:43:46.160]  and they sit out there with these signs i mean i hope to god they're getting paid for that stuff
[03:43:46.160 --> 03:43:50.960]  i mean and that's not real they mean i just don't understand how anybody when all this evidence is
[03:43:50.960 --> 03:43:55.920]  out at the end of the day like you can sleep good at night knowing that you're gonna vote for that
[03:43:55.920 --> 03:44:00.560]  evil human being yeah that's the most evil person in the world that's just what they want they just
[03:44:00.560 --> 03:44:05.840]  want her for whatever reason because it's a legacy you know the trade has been demonized for 10 times
[03:44:05.840 --> 03:44:11.200]  less and if you don't get her you're gonna get buried the socialists so that's that's what you're
[03:44:11.200 --> 03:44:15.360]  that's what you're looking at i want to go to lian macadoo uh did a report on on the clinton
[03:44:15.360 --> 03:44:18.640]  emails it's a real short one well we're gonna go that one we'll be right back after this
[03:44:18.640 --> 03:44:27.760]  i used a single uh account for convenience obviously uh these years later uh it doesn't
[03:44:27.760 --> 03:44:35.280]  look so convenient uh and most importantly i never sent um classified material on my email
[03:44:35.280 --> 03:44:41.920]  and i never received any uh that was marked classified 7 000 pages are set to be released
[03:44:41.920 --> 03:44:47.760]  from hillary clinton's private homebrew server this evening now under intense questioning the
[03:44:47.760 --> 03:44:54.560]  state department admits that within this latest data dump of emails about 150 of them will be
[03:44:54.560 --> 03:45:01.360]  upgraded to classified status now the agency spokesperson stressed that the information was
[03:45:01.360 --> 03:45:06.480]  not marked as classified at the time although he concedes that you know some changes are gonna
[03:45:06.480 --> 03:45:11.760]  have to be made within the intelligence community obviously there is absolutely no excuse for
[03:45:11.760 --> 03:45:18.240]  improperly handling sensitive information all of these emails resided on a private homebrew
[03:45:18.240 --> 03:45:23.680]  mail server that clinton had set up herself she controlled it it was away from the prying eyes of
[03:45:23.680 --> 03:45:30.560]  government inspectors and freedom of information act officials and it includes the 30 000 emails
[03:45:30.560 --> 03:45:37.600]  that hillary clinton already ordered to be deleted because she said they were personal in nature now
[03:45:37.600 --> 03:45:43.760]  obviously the question here is would those personal emails include pay-to-play donations
[03:45:43.760 --> 03:45:49.120]  that were made to the clinton foundation now let's not forget that while clinton was steering
[03:45:49.120 --> 03:45:54.880]  american foreign policy as the secretary of state donations were pouring into the clinton
[03:45:54.880 --> 03:46:00.960]  foundation and this includes a deal that gave the russians control of one-fifth of all uranium
[03:46:00.960 --> 03:46:07.600]  production capacity in the united states the company uranium one donated two point three five
[03:46:07.600 --> 03:46:12.720]  million dollars to the clinton foundation those contributions weren't publicly disclosed by the
[03:46:12.720 --> 03:46:17.920]  clintons despite an agreement that was struck between hillary and the obama white house
[03:46:17.920 --> 03:46:24.720]  to publicly identify all donors so could this be a reason why the establishment is throwing
[03:46:24.720 --> 03:46:32.480]  hillary to the wolves her sloppiness could expose a lot of other shady business deals there you go
[03:46:32.480 --> 03:46:37.920]  that was some interesting information from leon macadoo and i found this article this morning
[03:46:37.920 --> 03:46:44.080]  exclusive jailed hacker gucifer boast i used to read clinton's memos and then do the gardening
[03:46:44.080 --> 03:46:48.800]  and this is a really interesting article it's very long talks about his life where he comes from
[03:46:48.800 --> 03:46:54.320]  this is a guy in a village who taught himself how to hack one guy could break into the system
[03:46:54.320 --> 03:47:00.320]  and do what thousands of other hackers in china couldn't do one guy can you know can shake the
[03:47:00.320 --> 03:47:04.480]  system to its foundation and i can't remember if it's gucifer or not but i remember somebody hacked
[03:47:04.480 --> 03:47:08.800]  bush's uh computer it was him and uh then they got a picture of him like painting himself in the
[03:47:08.800 --> 03:47:13.920]  bathtub yeah all kind of stuff let me tell you these guys they're they're doing soul searching
[03:47:13.920 --> 03:47:18.160]  because they realize what they've done i mean when you look at those paintings at bush it's sad
[03:47:18.160 --> 03:47:24.160]  that guy is definitely sorry for what he i hope he's sorry for what he did i mean starting
[03:47:24.160 --> 03:47:29.120]  two wars have you seen that show uh that showed us a robot no no that's where they this hacker goes
[03:47:29.120 --> 03:47:33.520]  in and he goes to the evil core all these different corporations and exposes all the evil stuff they
[03:47:33.520 --> 03:47:38.000]  do they're they're they're past pedophilia all the stuff and just wrecks them it's a really
[03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:42.400]  neat show people have to check it out i haven't checked that out but here going back to clinton
[03:47:42.400 --> 03:47:47.120]  this is why she's gonna win she's got one fifth of the delegates already secured for her nomination
[03:47:47.120 --> 03:47:52.400]  this is out of bloomberg it came out on the 28th um as vice president joe biden considers a potential
[03:47:52.400 --> 03:47:56.240]  run hillary clinton's campaign is seeking to project dominance of the democratic national
[03:47:56.240 --> 03:48:01.920]  committee meeting in minneapolis and it goes on that she has one fifth of the delegates already
[03:48:01.920 --> 03:48:07.760]  um sewed up in her favor so bernie sanders it probably really doesn't matter you know the populist
[03:48:07.760 --> 03:48:12.000]  campaign you're going to run and try to get you know uh college kids out there to turn into little
[03:48:12.000 --> 03:48:17.520]  socialists um you're going to be beat by clinton unfortunately and i i mean i'm i've said it before
[03:48:17.520 --> 03:48:22.320]  it's it's probably going to be a clinton bush well it's still early though it is still early by the way
[03:48:22.320 --> 03:48:26.960]  by those after and obama's already said he's only given the tip he's already going to back him i don't
[03:48:26.960 --> 03:48:31.520]  think it matters well we we talked to larry nickels uh the clinton insider and he was telling uh josh
[03:48:31.520 --> 03:48:36.800]  and myself that this was all pretty much a plan with clinton he said if he was a victim yeah if he
[03:48:36.800 --> 03:48:41.760]  was running this campaign he would want her to be the underdog so then when the time came you know
[03:48:41.760 --> 03:48:45.760]  she's gonna have some massive resurgence for whatever reason and then she'll get the nomination
[03:48:45.760 --> 03:48:50.240]  she's going to court oh she's beat the charges she's beat the rap there's not they can't do anything
[03:48:50.240 --> 03:48:54.560]  they can't stop her now she's gonna take it all the way you see chris matthew's getting a tingle
[03:48:54.560 --> 03:48:59.440]  in his leg as he talks about it as i start to vomit all over the floor totally totally disgusting
[03:48:59.440 --> 03:49:04.160]  hey we're gonna go to break here in a second um i want to go to michael if i can't wish i go to
[03:49:04.160 --> 03:49:07.840]  the other collars but i want to play david night's report that he did two years ago now about the
[03:49:07.840 --> 03:49:12.800]  spy in the bag and how he got in there and other interesting killings that have happened uh you
[03:49:12.800 --> 03:49:16.000]  know people who said they weren't going to kill themselves but suddenly died michael we have about
[03:49:16.000 --> 03:49:19.280]  less than a minute what's your story the local sheriff having issues with the dod
[03:49:20.640 --> 03:49:26.400]  it was the uh actually the department of justice is what it was apparently he did something during
[03:49:26.400 --> 03:49:35.280]  an arrest punched another person and uh eight officers were put on uh paid leads because

[03:54:06.880 --> 03:54:12.000]  david night's report talking about how this man killed himself and put himself in a bag well three
[03:54:12.000 --> 03:54:18.720]  years after an mi6 code breakers body was found padlocked in a bag in an empty bathtub in an mi6
[03:54:18.720 --> 03:54:24.240]  safe house the london metropolitan police have ruled that it was an accident allow me to congratulate
[03:54:24.240 --> 03:54:29.120]  you on a brilliant bit of deduction that's right move along there's nothing to see here
[03:54:29.120 --> 03:54:35.520]  but there is plenty to see here about how governments work his body was found inside a zipped and
[03:54:35.520 --> 03:54:41.520]  padlocked bag in a bathtub no palm prints were on the side of the bathtub no traces of his dna on
[03:54:41.520 --> 03:54:48.560]  the padlock outside of the bag his cell phone was wiped clean that day and his employer mi6 that's
[03:54:48.560 --> 03:54:53.920]  british intelligence didn't report him missing for eight days despite the fact that his body was in
[03:54:53.920 --> 03:54:58.880]  one of their safe houses just blocks away from their headquarters and just last year the coroner
[03:54:58.880 --> 03:55:04.560]  concluded that he probably was killed by another person coroner fiona wilcox said that it was quote
[03:55:04.560 --> 03:55:10.160]  a legitimate line of inquiry that other spies were involved in the death of garith williams 31
[03:55:10.160 --> 03:55:16.640]  a member of the uk's secret intelligence service sis also known as mi6 but metropolitan police
[03:55:16.640 --> 03:55:23.920]  said he probably died accidentally on his own rejecting conspiracy theories his family said
[03:55:23.920 --> 03:55:29.440]  if this wasn't the sis and it was the cray twins or someone else you would be investigating you
[03:55:29.440 --> 03:55:34.800]  would have gone into far more detail and there were some more details thrown in he had 30 000
[03:55:34.800 --> 03:55:41.040]  dollars worth of unworn women's clothing a bright red wig and some suspicious sexual things there
[03:55:41.040 --> 03:55:47.520]  but the coroner's investigation ruled that he was not gay not a transvestite those things i believe
[03:55:47.520 --> 03:55:52.480]  were simply red herrings to distract people from what the real question is and that is
[03:55:52.480 --> 03:55:58.560]  how could he have gotten padlocked into the bag the press association reported that a former parachute
[03:55:58.560 --> 03:56:04.560]  regiment reservist who specializes in rescuing people from confined spaces was unable to lock
[03:56:04.560 --> 03:56:10.560]  himself inside an identical bag no palm prints were on the side of the bathtub no traces of
[03:56:10.560 --> 03:56:16.560]  his dna on the padlock outside of the bag he said i couldn't say it's impossible but i think even
[03:56:16.560 --> 03:56:21.440]  houdini would have struggled with this one this is something we've seen not just in the uk but
[03:56:21.440 --> 03:56:26.640]  frequently in the united states that people who have sensitive information about government secrets
[03:56:26.640 --> 03:56:34.000]  or about the people who run the government somehow just mysteriously die or commit suicide even though
[03:56:34.000 --> 03:56:38.480]  they didn't have any history of being suicidal and even though the explanations for their deaths
[03:56:38.480 --> 03:56:44.800]  make absolutely no sense take the case of gary webb investigative reporter who supposedly committed
[03:56:44.800 --> 03:56:51.280]  suicide by shooting himself in the head twice it was merely coincidental that he had exposed cia
[03:56:51.280 --> 03:56:57.840]  and reagan administration using the crack cocaine drug trade to finance nick rogwin contras or take
[03:56:57.840 --> 03:57:03.840]  debrajean palfrey the dc madam who had we're actually going to repost that video right now
[03:57:03.840 --> 03:57:07.360]  right right when i'm done with this you can look at the other instances of people who said they
[03:57:07.360 --> 03:57:11.280]  were going to come out and expose government corruption and then they end up dead now it's
[03:57:11.280 --> 03:57:15.680]  interesting that spy had obtained clinton's diary and passed it on to a friend so obviously
[03:57:15.680 --> 03:57:20.160]  that put him on well i'm pretty sure that's what put him on the hit list guys what do you think
[03:57:20.160 --> 03:57:26.320]  wrapping it up here today well just when we talk about all these people who had no desire to commit
[03:57:26.320 --> 03:57:30.400]  suicide whether dc madam or gary webb and then all of a sudden you know they die under these
[03:57:30.400 --> 03:57:35.360]  suspicious circumstances then it's just oh it's a suicide and nobody questions it right even though
[03:57:35.360 --> 03:57:39.920]  it no matter how suspicious these circumstances can be nobody will question it because they heard it
[03:57:39.920 --> 03:57:44.240]  on their favorite news channel that's what the clinton's get killed that's it that's how you end
[03:57:44.240 --> 03:57:48.960]  up part of the clinton body count sorry to taylor cash and philip we're not going to have time to get
[03:57:48.960 --> 03:57:52.960]  to you guys but you can see more reports are going to be here in the nightly news tonight

[03:57:57.040 --> 03:58:01.520]  things we're going to repost this report about the spy in the bag this we produced our report back
[03:58:01.520 --> 03:58:08.320]  in november of two uh 2013 so two years ahead now the mainstream media is talking about it once again
[03:58:08.320 --> 03:58:12.480]  and uh we'll never probably never get to the bottom of that death or the any of the others as long
[03:58:12.480 --> 03:58:17.520]  as we let these control freaks stay in power so have your cell phone camera handy and anytime
