[00:00.000 --> 00:10.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:10.800 --> 00:18.360]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.360 --> 00:36.280]  Texas Alex Jones well as usual last night this morning and now sitting here
[00:36.280 --> 00:40.320]  in trouble these stories going over and before we went live moments ago I don't
[00:40.320 --> 00:45.400]  know where to start because there's just so much crazy out-of-control news going
[00:45.400 --> 00:50.600]  on you never know when the public is going to have their attention captured
[00:50.600 --> 00:57.000]  by corruption huge horrible things can go on for a long time and then suddenly
[00:57.000 --> 01:05.800]  the straw breaks the camel's back but the cover-up of the death list now going
[01:05.800 --> 01:13.920]  back to 2008 of veterans at the VA hospital system is really making the
[01:13.920 --> 01:19.640]  public angry and my point is are you angry about that more than you're angry
[01:19.640 --> 01:24.400]  about the Pentagon Homeland Security and local police departments publicly
[01:24.400 --> 01:28.320]  training to take on veterans and gun owners saying they're the number one
[01:28.320 --> 01:36.160]  enemy the number one threat I mean that's twilight zone level and I use that
[01:36.160 --> 01:40.240]  term twilight zone outer limits because it's such a big deal and this is
[01:40.240 --> 01:44.880]  starting to capture people's attention after we covered it last week and drugs
[01:44.880 --> 01:51.880]  report com carried it Sunday and Monday there are a bunch of news articles in
[01:51.880 --> 01:59.160]  local newspapers responding as the media the local media that's mainstream media
[01:59.160 --> 02:02.040]  but more alternative because at least they report you know some important
[02:02.040 --> 02:05.760]  stories they're not totally controlled I'm a bigger fan of local mainstream media
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.200]  that I am a national global estate run media but still they regurgitate so much
[02:10.200 --> 02:14.720]  of it it's a it's a hybrid of the two in my view police fight protection is
[02:14.720 --> 02:19.520]  need for heavily armored truck that's out of the Northwestern newspaper and I've
[02:19.520 --> 02:24.760]  got several others here Wisconsin police reassure residents they won't be shot
[02:24.760 --> 02:32.160]  at from military truck and so we're starting to force a debate about this
[02:32.160 --> 02:41.640]  kind of like four months ago I sent Jakari Jackson and crew out to the West
[02:41.640 --> 02:45.720]  Coast because of increased radiation levels and they cited our report and a
[02:45.720 --> 02:50.680]  bunch of newspapers as the reason that the news started to cover it now the
[02:50.680 --> 02:54.120]  Navy's involved the Department of Energy is involved in this confirming all
[02:54.120 --> 02:58.600]  sorts of increased radiation different ice tubs associated with Fukushima but
[02:58.600 --> 03:03.640]  also illegal dumping all over the West Coast and I'm not bragging hey we
[03:03.640 --> 03:10.760]  reported on something and now you know it's getting picked up I'm saying you
[03:10.760 --> 03:15.800]  have that power to the issue is when when when dinosaur media won't cover
[03:15.800 --> 03:21.320]  serious issues we can't just sit there and complain and say you know they're
[03:21.320 --> 03:27.280]  setting the agenda we have to go out and start our own YouTube channels access
[03:27.280 --> 03:31.560]  TV shows local radio shows that's how you get a syndicated radio show the
[03:31.560 --> 03:35.080]  journey of a thousand miles starts a single step if you go out with a camera
[03:35.080 --> 03:39.160]  and report on things with your own Geiger counter or if you go out and
[03:39.160 --> 03:42.680]  report on crime in your area you'll end up having a bigger audience than
[03:42.680 --> 03:46.080]  mainstream media because you're reporting on what you think's important and
[03:46.080 --> 03:50.800]  guess what nine times out of ten it's gonna resonate with other people in
[03:50.800 --> 03:54.920]  your area and your goal isn't to have a website with a bunch of traffic and just
[03:54.920 --> 03:59.680]  make money but it's good to go out have your advocacy for truth and justice and
[03:59.680 --> 04:05.480]  make money to fund a better platform the two things go together like a horse and
[04:05.480 --> 04:09.680]  carriage that's why the White House memos that came out from Clinton a few
[04:09.680 --> 04:14.800]  months ago and the rest of it point to the fact that the system is obsessed
[04:14.800 --> 04:20.560]  with any type of economy be it media be it food you know information whatever it
[04:20.560 --> 04:23.600]  is they don't want you going to farmers markets they don't want you buying milk
[04:23.600 --> 04:26.640]  from Amish they don't want you start your own website they don't want you
[04:26.640 --> 04:30.680]  supporting a local independent radio show they don't want you to do that
[04:30.680 --> 04:33.800]  because they want to control the whole game and have you only go through their
[04:33.800 --> 04:38.720]  system we start revolutionary thought of just changing our activities our
[04:38.720 --> 04:43.720]  behavior a little bit and it'll shift the whole paradigm because people are so
[04:43.720 --> 04:49.400]  hungry for that so that's coming up huge news on China and a web war huge news on
[04:49.400 --> 04:55.440]  an invasion of Libya China and Vietnam on the edge of war I mean the world's

[08:40.120 --> 08:45.160]  I'm gonna do my best to cover it all China halts cybersecurity cooperation
[08:45.160 --> 08:52.360]  after U.S. spying charges that is breaking via Bloomberg right now and of
[08:52.360 --> 08:58.280]  course there's now espionage charges that the quote U.S. is levying against
[08:58.280 --> 09:02.680]  Chinese individuals China's decision to suspend its involvement the cybersecurity
[09:02.680 --> 09:06.560]  working group with the U.S. after being accused of commercial spying threats to
[09:06.560 --> 09:11.360]  undo efforts aimed at finding common ground to tackle hacking China halted
[09:11.360 --> 09:15.640]  the dialogue and threatened further retaliation after the U.S. indicted five
[09:15.640 --> 09:19.720]  Chinese military officials yesterday for allegedly stealing trade secrets China's
[09:19.720 --> 09:23.120]  foreign ministry called the U.S. move a serious violation of the basic norms of
[09:23.120 --> 09:26.720]  international relations while China's state Internet Information Office
[09:26.720 --> 09:32.600]  linked the U.S. actions to a thief yelling catch the thief the group was
[09:32.600 --> 09:37.680]  established by John Kerry I mean the Clintons were famous for transferring
[09:37.680 --> 09:41.360]  missile secrets computer secrets avionics to the communist Chinese
[09:41.360 --> 09:46.240]  government so this is this is getting serious China has now summoned the U.S.
[09:46.240 --> 09:51.760]  envoy Reuters is reporting China some of the U.S. ambassador after the United
[09:51.760 --> 09:57.520]  Nations United States accused five Chinese military officials of hacking
[09:57.520 --> 10:01.440]  into American companies to steal trade secrets warning Washington it could take
[10:01.440 --> 10:07.360]  further action the foreign ministry said on Tuesday so things are heating up
[10:07.360 --> 10:13.360]  big time right now ladies and gentlemen I'm gonna play a clip in a moment of the
[10:13.360 --> 10:19.440]  Russian Prime Minister saying we're quote approaching a second Cold War notice
[10:19.440 --> 10:22.760]  you've got Thailand declaring martial law and shutting down the media that they
[10:22.760 --> 10:26.800]  don't control you notice you've got China massing troops on its border with
[10:26.800 --> 10:31.080]  Vietnam basically threatening to invade you notice you've got all hell breaking
[10:31.080 --> 10:37.160]  loose in a global a sponsored civil war proxy war in Ukraine and we've got
[10:37.160 --> 10:44.720]  another Reuters headline here today U.S. moves more forces closer to Libya as
[10:44.720 --> 10:50.000]  unrest grows and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that it is a totally
[10:50.000 --> 10:56.080]  failed society run by al-Qaeda since it was quote liberated three years ago by
[10:56.080 --> 11:02.280]  NATO backing al-Qaeda forces the only industrialized country in the north or
[11:02.280 --> 11:06.280]  central Africa South Africa is partially industrialized in some of its city
[11:06.280 --> 11:09.840]  areas very high tech in some of its cities but still kind of like a first
[11:09.840 --> 11:15.120]  world within a third world Africa is is literally being destabilized and the
[11:15.120 --> 11:21.560]  globalist put al-Qaeda in charge use it to then destabilize the whole area not
[11:21.560 --> 11:25.960]  just northern Africa but western central eastern Africa and then the answer is
[11:25.960 --> 11:31.560]  move in U.S. troops to take control of airfields for drone bases to quote fight
[11:31.560 --> 11:35.560]  the al-Qaeda they put in charge the same al-Qaeda was running security in
[11:35.560 --> 11:41.400]  Benghazi that went over during the stand down to kill the ambassador so that's
[11:41.400 --> 11:46.240]  what's going on and the Turkish head ambassador was there as well hours
[11:46.240 --> 11:52.480]  before Stevens was killed I mean it's just crazy and let me explain what a
[11:52.480 --> 12:05.320]  world war is my lay definition it's when you have multiple major powers fighting
[12:05.320 --> 12:10.520]  simultaneous two front wars on multiple continents let's see if my definition is
[12:10.520 --> 12:17.760]  good guys search engine the definition of a world war but the point is is that
[12:17.760 --> 12:23.120]  that's what's happening ladies and gentlemen and the first artificially
[12:23.120 --> 12:26.640]  intelligent computers aren't coming they're here they can predict the future
[12:26.640 --> 12:30.360]  in mass movements the individual movements when Amazon can predict what
[12:30.360 --> 12:34.320]  you're going to order before you order it and it's already having a robot package
[12:34.320 --> 12:41.600]  it that's AI and when you've got regional wars going on everywhere that's a
[12:41.600 --> 12:46.120]  world war world war three they call the cold war well if this is world war four
[12:46.120 --> 12:52.680]  via proxies it's begun I would say world war four is beginning definition of
[12:52.680 --> 12:59.560]  world war according to what Webster a war engaged in by all or most of the
[12:59.560 --> 13:07.480]  principal nations of the world especially capitalized both WS either to such
[13:07.480 --> 13:14.680]  wars of the first of the 20th century that's right major powers involved in
[13:14.680 --> 13:20.880]  multi-continent warfare is generally the definition that I was taught but when
[13:20.880 --> 13:26.120]  you look at China threatening to attack Japanese islands threatening to take
[13:26.120 --> 13:33.080]  Philippine islands they're acting just like Japan did in the 30s in the lead up
[13:33.080 --> 13:38.440]  to the tech on Pearl Harbor when you've got China belligerently grabbing oil
[13:38.440 --> 13:44.400]  rich waters off the coast of Vietnam that are not theirs that's that's how the
[13:44.400 --> 13:51.320]  Japanese behaved back in the 30s when you actually invaded Vietnam to get the
[13:51.320 --> 13:55.720]  rubber trees and a bunch of other stuff and the slave labor when you've got
[13:55.720 --> 13:58.880]  North Korea acting belligerently and constantly pulling stuff now and
[13:58.880 --> 14:05.680]  artillery barrages when you've got the proxy war for the EU into Ukraine when
[14:05.680 --> 14:12.720]  you've got the destabilization of Middle East using al-Qaeda with the US then and
[14:12.720 --> 14:17.440]  NATO bringing troops up in the rear and you add all the other stuff that's
[14:17.440 --> 14:22.800]  going on around the world this is the beginning of World War 4 the Pentagon
[14:22.800 --> 14:30.160]  calls the Cold War World War 3 they say World War 3 was already fought and it
[14:30.160 --> 14:36.120]  went on from the 50s with Korea right through up until the fall the quote
[14:36.120 --> 14:41.240]  Soviet Union in the late 1980s up until 1991 and Boris Yeltsin and all the rest
[14:41.240 --> 14:48.000]  of it but there's major resets going on right now and it has to do with the
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.880]  global devaluation of currencies not just the dollar it has to do with you've
[14:51.880 --> 14:56.280]  got inflation in some sectors deflation and others by design you've got a
[14:56.280 --> 15:00.360]  managed controlled global economy with the Anglo-American establishment at the
[15:00.360 --> 15:11.480]  top but China and Russia as major players this is a serious situation and I
[15:11.480 --> 15:15.360]  know I've state the obvious here you got major gas deals going on right now
[15:15.360 --> 15:20.920]  between Russia and China to supply China all the oil and gas they need that's
[15:20.920 --> 15:25.080]  what's happening and this is not being done the globalists are not trying to
[15:25.080 --> 15:28.920]  destabilize Russia and China right now because they want to help America they
[15:28.920 --> 15:34.000]  want Russia down they want China down they want the US down but with China as
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.560]  the strongest overall to be the main UN police force in the future that's all
[15:38.560 --> 15:42.160]  the state about David Rockefeller this is a big presence he and you can go pull
[15:42.160 --> 15:46.440]  up op-eds they've both written in the New York Times on that subject endorsing
[15:46.440 --> 15:51.520]  Chinese communism as the model this isn't really communism it's a tiny elite
[15:51.520 --> 15:56.880]  with slave factories everywhere calling it communism in fact the last Chinese
[15:56.880 --> 16:02.280]  president before the new one came in was in the BBC it was quoted and he said I
[16:02.280 --> 16:05.760]  forget I forget his name I remember reading the quote over and over again on
[16:05.760 --> 16:10.960]  air he in fact people could probably search into this Chinese communism is
[16:10.960 --> 16:18.120]  the ultimate expression of pure perfect capitalism was the quote Chinese
[16:18.120 --> 16:23.440]  communism Chinese style communism is the perfect and pure expression of
[16:23.440 --> 16:28.720]  capitalism and people said that doesn't make any sense no no to the globalist
[16:28.720 --> 16:33.520]  it does it's a managed capitalism with elites offshore above the law with
[16:33.520 --> 16:37.640]  interparty members over each country worth billions and billions living in
[16:37.640 --> 16:44.600]  giant leisure palaces you live in a loincloth in a coffin apartment that's
[16:44.600 --> 16:50.400]  less than a hundred square feet when they're done with you they live in giant
[16:50.400 --> 16:55.640]  leisure palaces with guards everywhere you understand that they want you poor
[16:55.640 --> 17:03.000]  to control you now let's play the Russian Prime Minister coming out and
[17:03.000 --> 17:07.680]  saying a new Cold War is basically starting some decisions taken by the
[17:07.680 --> 17:11.800]  US administration are disappointing we have indeed done a lot for Russian US
[17:11.800 --> 17:16.080]  relations I believe doing so was right the agreements that were reached of
[17:16.080 --> 17:20.460]  America were useful and I'm very sorry that everything that has been achieved
[17:20.460 --> 17:25.320]  is now being eliminated by those decisions basically we are slowly but
[17:25.320 --> 17:30.120]  surely approaching a second Cold War that nobody needs why am I saying this
[17:30.120 --> 17:35.880]  because a competent politician knows how to make reserved careful subtle wise and
[17:35.880 --> 17:40.640]  intelligent decisions which I believe mr. Obama succeeded that for a while but
[17:40.640 --> 17:44.240]  what is being done now unfortunately proves that the US administration has
[17:44.240 --> 17:47.720]  learned out of those resources and the United States is one of the parties to
[17:47.720 --> 17:56.160]  suffer from this but the globalist want more weapons sales they want Russia to
[17:56.160 --> 17:59.720]  have to spend its money on weapons instead of development and then the
[17:59.720 --> 18:04.520]  globalist by creating destabilization they stand again and I know I'm stating
[18:04.520 --> 18:08.200]  the obvious here it's just that it's hiding in plain view and the general
[18:08.200 --> 18:13.280]  public I'm actually starting to hear anti-russian talk in restaurants and on
[18:13.280 --> 18:19.200]  the streets and on talk radio and it is just ultimately stupid the Russians
[18:19.200 --> 18:23.240]  are collapsing their population is collapsing the Soviet Union collapsed
[18:23.240 --> 18:27.720]  they're just trying to get back on their feet and we don't stand to gain by a
[18:27.720 --> 18:32.200]  Cold War with the Russians any more than we do having the Middle East to
[18:32.200 --> 18:36.760]  stabilize and al-Qaeda put in charge everywhere so this is a big big deal and
[18:36.760 --> 18:40.920]  we'll open the phones up and get your take on this as well but you see how
[18:40.920 --> 18:44.960]  everything's moving at once they're rolling out that yeah the domestic
[18:44.960 --> 18:48.160]  military and militarized police and armored vehicles and tanks is for
[18:48.160 --> 18:51.760]  veterans and gun owners yeah yeah we we think you're gonna start blowing stuff
[18:51.760 --> 18:56.040]  up anymore on can see that it's a globalist of the are the ones that have
[18:56.040 --> 19:01.440]  the motive the history and the means to do it so we're just waiting for that
[19:01.440 --> 19:07.400]  shoe to drop that balloon to go up I'm gonna get into this livius situation
[19:07.400 --> 19:11.920]  we're going to get into study shows no shortage of high-tech workers in the US
[19:11.920 --> 19:15.600]  yeah there's a glut of high-tech workers they want to drive down the wages even
[19:15.600 --> 19:19.160]  more people say well that's fine that's free market no it's not free market to
[19:19.160 --> 19:24.600]  compete with India and China that basically are in slavery or people live
[19:24.600 --> 19:29.160]  20 people to a room it's a race to the bottom Ross Perot was right it's basic
[19:29.160 --> 19:35.520]  economics but Canada opened up free trade with us five years ago their average
[19:35.520 --> 19:40.160]  worker industrial was getting $35 an hour it's $15 an hour five years waiting
[19:40.160 --> 19:44.320]  our average industrial worker $20 an hour you go to Mexico it's gonna drop down
[19:44.320 --> 19:50.200]  to 10 now you want that to happen this is not gonna build up society it's gonna
[19:50.200 --> 19:56.040]  implode it well I tell you what Ross Perot was 100% correct but Al Gore last
[19:56.040 --> 20:01.200]  study when that's all that mattered he was right Al Gore virtually anyone can

[34:43.840 --> 34:51.080]  of info wars is a more responsive system based on breaking news and it's a lot
[34:51.080 --> 34:58.160]  easier to navigate so be sure and check out the new info wars.com and then
[34:58.160 --> 35:01.560]  again we're going to try out some other designs with prisonplanet.com but we
[35:01.560 --> 35:04.560]  tried a couple other designs people didn't like we launched this last night
[35:04.560 --> 35:08.280]  we're getting up to 95% positive reviews so I think we're going to stick with
[35:08.280 --> 35:12.200]  this and then as I said phase it into something that looks more like the
[35:12.200 --> 35:19.720]  London Guardian meets Wired magazine or something over the next six months I
[35:19.720 --> 35:23.680]  mean it'll it won't look the same in six months it's just that people cannot
[35:23.680 --> 35:29.240]  stand a whole new look even if it's clean so we're just gonna I mean we can't
[35:29.240 --> 35:33.440]  damage the fact that this site has over a million people that visited every day
[35:33.440 --> 35:38.920]  and it's one of the largest alternative media sites in the world so it's got an
[35:38.920 --> 35:42.280]  old eight-year design that's been great it was great eight years ago when Kurt
[35:42.280 --> 35:45.640]  Nemo designed it that's just been on a date for a few years and so Kurt's
[35:45.640 --> 35:49.120]  really worked with everybody to update it we appreciate his fine work and the
[35:49.120 --> 35:59.680]  whole whole team Buckley Hammond Anthony Gutiarty Molly Rogers and so
[35:59.680 --> 36:03.320]  many other the whole crew here Tim Frisch everybody's just done a great
[36:03.320 --> 36:06.800]  job I there's no way to think everybody that worked on getting it updated but
[36:06.800 --> 36:10.720]  again info wars.com then of course you have the backup mirror side that's not
[36:10.720 --> 36:13.920]  really a mirror but it has most the same news but a lot of news that doesn't
[36:13.920 --> 36:17.400]  ever get to info wars for some reason ends up on prison planets you need to
[36:17.400 --> 36:21.200]  visit both sides obviously we appreciate you clicking on the sponsors as well to
[36:21.200 --> 36:27.880]  support the broadcast and finally I was gonna do it this week again but then I've
[36:27.880 --> 36:31.400]  been messing with a whole bunch of other stuff we're rolling out I tend to bite
[36:31.400 --> 36:34.680]  off more than I can chew and I'm learning to eat the elephant one bite at a
[36:34.680 --> 36:38.240]  time we're getting close to launching in the new studio and if it's not later in
[36:38.240 --> 36:43.120]  the week it'll be next week I'll start hosting the news in the new studio it's
[36:43.120 --> 36:46.800]  just that again we've been working mainly with satellite uplinks and you know
[36:46.800 --> 36:50.680]  the format of the TV show and a bunch of other things we've been doing and just
[36:50.680 --> 36:54.080]  keeping all the other plates in the air all other balls in the air it's like a
[36:54.080 --> 36:57.320]  cartoon where the character has like a hundred plates in each hand trying to
[36:57.320 --> 37:01.160]  balance it but we're getting there we're getting there part of our strength is
[37:01.160 --> 37:04.680]  we're totally independent and don't have consultants really and I kind of built
[37:04.680 --> 37:10.080]  this on my own just from the ground up so that's what made it resilient
[37:10.080 --> 37:16.960]  successful and avant-garde in many respects but also sloth like and quirky
[37:16.960 --> 37:22.120]  in other ways you know we move at light speed in some ways and kind of rattle
[37:22.120 --> 37:25.440]  trap and others but it's getting better and better and we've just got a
[37:25.440 --> 37:29.680]  superlative team overall that are staying on mission and focus and doing a
[37:29.680 --> 37:32.400]  better and better job and everybody can hear that with a radio show see that
[37:32.400 --> 37:37.800]  with a simulcast with TV and so much more and you the listeners taking action
[37:37.800 --> 37:42.520]  out there we should not take the fact this show is on the air for granted we
[37:42.520 --> 37:47.440]  should not take other libertarian freedom-based sites for granted because
[37:47.440 --> 37:55.400]  just because we're starting to win the info award does not mean that the
[37:55.400 --> 37:58.560]  globalists aren't going to strike back and aren't striking back starting all
[37:58.560 --> 38:03.040]  these war wars worldwide economic crises health crises that they could either
[38:03.040 --> 38:09.080]  exacerbate or stage it's a critical juncture and you see the world speeding
[38:09.080 --> 38:15.720]  up the quickening the the presingularities that are starting to happen
[38:15.720 --> 38:19.040]  they're going to shake society up in a lot of good ways but also a lot of bad
[38:19.040 --> 38:24.720]  ways but being aware of these changes and not just blowing them off is the way
[38:24.720 --> 38:29.480]  to be successful in a time of change a lot of people think being politically
[38:29.480 --> 38:34.720]  and economically aware geopolitically aware technologically aware of major
[38:34.720 --> 38:41.200]  trends and futurist paradigms and projecting the lines forward people
[38:41.200 --> 38:45.520]  think of that as work hey let's just go party let's just have go have fun well
[38:45.520 --> 38:51.040]  you need balance in life and if you don't spend any time learning about the
[38:51.040 --> 38:54.880]  mysteries of the universe you're going to be a very dull unhappy narcissistic
[38:54.880 --> 39:02.640]  person who only cares about vanity and vanity will fade or the looks that you're
[39:02.640 --> 39:11.240]  vain about or the bobbles the toys will fade and will not deliver to you in my
[39:11.240 --> 39:15.800]  experience but historically this has been well documented and this is a lot of
[39:15.800 --> 39:20.280]  common sense I'm putting out here I'm not reinventing the wheel vanity will
[39:20.280 --> 39:28.520]  destroy you worldliness will destroy you bobbles goods the worship of things in
[39:28.520 --> 39:35.480]  the final equation will not fulfill you but at the same time if the globalist
[39:35.480 --> 39:40.680]  can keep you poor never attaining goods you will never know that they really
[39:40.680 --> 39:43.720]  don't matter in the final equation once you have good shelter good
[39:43.720 --> 39:50.880]  transportation and basic healthcare then you go oh wow I want to go on and help
[39:50.880 --> 39:54.480]  other people or I want to go on and create art I want to go on and explore I
[39:54.480 --> 39:58.520]  want to trailblaze I want to invent that's the real human spirit so they
[39:58.520 --> 40:04.080]  try to keep you suppressed and not getting those basic things you need so
[40:04.080 --> 40:07.720]  that you will stay basically trapped in their paradigm so I'm not saying that
[40:07.720 --> 40:12.600]  material things don't matter if you didn't have material things they're going
[40:12.600 --> 40:17.720]  to matter if you can't get the money to pay for your children's root canal it's
[40:17.720 --> 40:21.480]  going to be a big deal if you can't get money to put fuel in your tank to get to
[40:21.480 --> 40:26.360]  work it hurts bad when you're speeding because you're late 10 miles over the
[40:26.360 --> 40:30.880]  speed limit and the cop pulls you over and writes you that $200 tickets that
[40:30.880 --> 40:37.680]  you don't have so everything in this world is balance and obviously a paradox
[40:37.680 --> 40:42.480]  but I'm digressing I want to get into the attack on the internet first then
[40:42.480 --> 40:49.520]  these other reports coming up in the third hour it's so crazy the audio so
[40:49.520 --> 40:53.760]  crazy that I'm going to air it just to illustrate how out-of-control Satanist
[40:53.760 --> 41:06.360]  are Dan Bedondi last week was up there at that black mass in Connecticut that
[41:06.360 --> 41:09.960]  was at the major college there that got so much attention but you guys brought
[41:09.960 --> 41:15.880]  it into my stack where is that no no I was asked for you to print me some more
[41:15.880 --> 41:20.560]  on the black mass at the start of the show I saw you doing it I just wanted
[41:20.560 --> 41:28.320]  the details of that thank you but the point is is that Dan Bedondi meld us
[41:28.320 --> 41:32.880]  the footage gets you trouble uploading it or whatever but the point is is that
[41:32.880 --> 41:37.040]  we got the footage Friday we saw it yesterday and we're going to premiere
[41:37.040 --> 41:41.880]  some of it here because none of this has been on the news little short sound bites
[41:41.880 --> 41:46.400]  about the news we have like an hour of this we have ten minutes of it boiled
[41:46.400 --> 41:51.920]  down that is sensational now five minutes of it I'll get posted info wars
[41:51.920 --> 41:59.960]  calm it was on the nightly news last night but we have ten minutes that hasn't
[41:59.960 --> 42:03.120]  been seen I'm gonna premiere coming up the third hour of your radio listener
[42:03.120 --> 42:07.040]  you go to info wars.com for its last show to find the free video feeds if you
[42:07.040 --> 42:10.320]  want to see it or you can listen to it but the Satanist are running around
[42:10.320 --> 42:14.520]  saying we will kill you Christians there will be blood everywhere we want your
[42:14.520 --> 42:20.200]  blood and I mean the Satanist their eyes I think it's a trick of the lights
[42:20.200 --> 42:23.160]  but they're actually glowing in the dark I mean it's like something out of a
[42:23.160 --> 42:28.280]  movie folks these are like real Satanist yeah they say they own our
[42:28.280 --> 42:33.800]  children like MSNBC yeah it's it's unbelievable and the Christians are out
[42:33.800 --> 42:42.880]  there and some of them are as hokey as the Satanist are crazy and some of these
[42:42.880 --> 42:47.680]  Satanists doing this at Harvard at the church sanctioned by the University
[42:47.680 --> 42:51.200]  they're prominent Satanists they're the ones that want to get the public plaques
[42:51.200 --> 42:57.040]  of Bathelman with the children lovingly sitting in his lap and I just want to
[42:57.040 --> 43:03.760]  illustrate the type of people this culture is creating but the it was not
[43:03.760 --> 43:08.480]  canceled because of protest Harvard had agreed that they could quote recreate
[43:08.480 --> 43:14.120]  the black mass but when the Satanist showed up they were so out of control
[43:14.120 --> 43:18.800]  desecrating the church and doing stuff in it reportedly this is what Baddandi
[43:18.800 --> 43:22.600]  has reported and was there and that's some of it on tape that that's when the
[43:22.600 --> 43:26.160]  school said look you got to get out of here because these people were running
[43:26.160 --> 43:30.800]  around howling and were completely out of control and I got to be honest with
[43:30.800 --> 43:35.480]  you I had a real instinct to want to punch these people in the nose people
[43:35.480 --> 43:44.360]  against goodness and normalcy PHA and pagan ah there are two who have not
[43:44.360 --> 43:57.720]  yet set the nectar of Saitan see folks that's a pagan party right there some
[43:57.720 --> 44:12.720]  pills by the way in high school growing up I actually got taken I said this on
[44:12.720 --> 44:16.400]  there I got taken to a couple of the just the regular pagan parties and then
[44:16.400 --> 44:19.040]  one time I didn't know where I was going in college and they took me to one
[44:19.040 --> 44:24.760]  because those are super widespread and and that's just a bunch of crazy people
[44:24.760 --> 44:28.400]  wanting to party usually led by Satanist at the top that want to manipulate and
[44:28.400 --> 44:32.760]  control people it is a cult that's bad but the Satanist are an entirely
[44:32.760 --> 44:37.480]  different ball of wax then you've got the Luciferians and of course you can
[44:37.480 --> 44:41.640]  argue the pagans are really worshiping Satan which they are the horned God you
[44:41.640 --> 44:46.320]  know the the Druids and people get mad and say that's not who our God is we
[44:46.320 --> 44:50.840]  don't sacrifice people look that's pure bull go take an anthropology course
[44:50.840 --> 44:56.040]  stop saying you don't sacrifice kids then you're not following a druidic right
[44:56.040 --> 45:03.320]  then you're not you're not following a Celtic system okay you're not following
[45:03.320 --> 45:08.720]  a Babylonian system you're not fall worldwide every culture sacrifices
[45:08.720 --> 45:13.720]  children on fire altars okay every culture the Aztecs did it
[45:13.720 --> 45:18.080]  everybody did it Aztecs mainly cut their hearts out but they also drowned them
[45:18.080 --> 45:22.080]  and burned them and every culture did it even the ancient Chinese had some of it
[45:22.080 --> 45:26.320]  going on the Chinese were the first to stop it I got to give them credit 5,000
[45:26.320 --> 45:33.600]  years ago so let's just act because I always love the the Wiccans send me
[45:33.600 --> 45:37.080]  emails and stuff they get real mad and they say Alex what's saying we're
[45:37.080 --> 45:41.120]  Satanist and we you know that we sacrifice kids well you're not really
[45:41.120 --> 45:48.600]  a Wiccan then you're a modern kind of bleached out fake one who just says that
[45:48.600 --> 45:52.400]  they you know follow Mother Earth stuff and all this stuff fine whatever I'm
[45:52.400 --> 45:55.800]  not even saying you're a bad person let's just be honest about it I'm not
[45:55.800 --> 46:01.760]  judging you I'm just telling you at the bottom of the rat hole is the murder of
[46:01.760 --> 46:11.040]  children I don't like it the exploitation of children so that's coming up in the
[46:11.040 --> 46:15.960]  third hour I'll I'll play that 10 minute report and give commentary on it
[46:15.960 --> 46:20.080]  well we will premiere that here so we should tweet out that we're gonna show
[46:20.080 --> 46:25.040]  the black mass and fights I don't know how you describe it I mean I came with
[46:25.040 --> 46:34.200]  words Satanist battle Christians in the streets of Connecticut Satanist call for
[46:34.200 --> 46:40.360]  blood of Christians I mean these people are literally foaming at the mouth in a
[46:40.360 --> 46:49.160]  demonic rage and I'm just saying I'm just saying it's a good I'm just saying I'm
[46:49.160 --> 46:53.080]  not trying to act tough folks I'm not tough I've been at a broken leg in a
[46:53.080 --> 46:58.560]  fight and in the hospital I've had my butt kicked plenty of times but if these
[46:58.560 --> 47:01.920]  Satanists got my face we're saying stuff I'm telling you I could not help it I
[47:01.920 --> 47:05.480]  would definitely a punch them in the nose then they'd be like look at the
[47:05.480 --> 47:10.080]  Christian being aggressive your call of people's blood and saying your children
[47:10.080 --> 47:17.120]  belong to us I mean I just can't handle it anymore now I'm not saying we should
[47:17.120 --> 47:26.240]  burn them at the stake or anything I don't know man it's just out of control
[47:26.240 --> 47:33.200]  ties them waterlog logs to them throw them in the water see if they sink if
[47:33.200 --> 47:36.040]  they sink it means they're innocent but they die if they float they're a witch a
[47:36.040 --> 47:40.560]  witch a witch I'm joking folks I'm not saying do that I'm quoting Monty
[47:40.560 --> 47:44.920]  Python the point is we don't just air stuff because it's entertaining but
[47:44.920 --> 47:49.880]  this is sensational so we're gonna play that coming up in the third hour and
[47:49.880 --> 47:53.760]  tied into Bohemian Grove and Luciferianism what is Luciferianism versus
[47:53.760 --> 48:03.880]  Satanism versus pagan parties which are just ubiquitous ubiquitous they've had
[48:03.880 --> 48:08.360]  articles in Texas monthly you know with years ago with Democratic officials that
[48:08.360 --> 48:12.520]  go out and literally a bunch of women go out and howl at the moon and you know do
[48:12.520 --> 48:17.800]  witchcraft I mean it's just that mainstream folks so it's all gonna get
[48:17.800 --> 48:21.680]  broken down today we're gonna go to break and I promise I'm gonna come back
[48:21.680 --> 48:25.840]  and get into how they're gonna kill the internet and how we can stop it the plan

[55:19.040 --> 55:24.760]  bunch of apple trees on top of me ladies and gentlemen let's get into how they
[55:24.760 --> 55:29.360]  plan to kill the internet the plan to kill the internet uncovered ten waves the
[55:29.360 --> 55:35.760]  freedom of the worldwide web is being dismantled the internet has emerged as
[55:35.760 --> 55:39.640]  the most empowering tool of individual freedom since the Gutenberg press
[55:39.640 --> 55:43.800]  affording billions of people worldwide only the tool of instant communication
[55:43.800 --> 55:48.800]  but access to the wealth of liberating information freedom from the change of
[55:48.800 --> 55:54.800]  received consensus and the opportunity to become their own media platform as well
[55:54.800 --> 56:00.280]  as commerce and ideas it's just across the board this represents an ever
[56:00.280 --> 56:03.920]  increasing threat to the status quo the elite which is why the establishment is
[56:03.920 --> 56:08.640]  working feverishly to dismantle the freedom granted by the worldwide web in
[56:08.640 --> 56:14.480]  its current form and we go through the death of net neutrality worldwide that's
[56:14.480 --> 56:19.240]  openly being announced number two intelligence agencies are manipulating
[56:19.240 --> 56:24.840]  internet with deliberate disinformation and governments are paying trolls to
[56:24.840 --> 56:29.960]  sway public opinion media news websites are killing comment sections the
[56:29.960 --> 56:32.400]  Obama administration's cognitive infiltration of the internet with
[56:32.400 --> 56:37.880]  Cass Sunstein to create this info false flag cyber security attacks FBI CIA
[56:37.880 --> 56:41.880]  releasing worms on purpose to then bring the web down as a pretext for increased
[56:41.880 --> 56:46.320]  web regulation number seven fairness doctrine for the internet's being
[56:46.320 --> 56:51.360]  openly announced and the head of the FCC has said it's a plan to target
[56:51.360 --> 56:57.000]  libertarian media like Matt Drudge homeland securities internet kill switch
[56:57.000 --> 57:00.600]  number eight which they openly announced they're putting the hubs in to do it
[57:00.600 --> 57:04.320]  just like Thailand just killed the internet basically for news under
[57:04.320 --> 57:08.760]  martial law number nine new taxes and regulations set to stop all communications
[57:08.760 --> 57:14.200]  and sales on the web and to surveil it web IDs soap and system the FBI's
[57:14.200 --> 57:19.000]  internet backdoor we should probably add a few bonuses at the end the web ID
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.840]  they're pushing and a lot about the stuff but that's the ten big ways they're
[57:23.840 --> 57:28.280]  doing it and actually I talked about this with Paul he did a transcript of
[57:28.280 --> 57:32.040]  some of what I said we need to add internet to where they create the fast
[57:32.040 --> 57:41.400]  lane internets to quote bush internets we need to add the 10 but then say and
[57:41.400 --> 57:47.760]  incidentally the last two are even more important two bonus ones I'm gonna call
[57:47.760 --> 57:52.560]  Watson I want to get added internet fast lanes is net neutrality but but it's
[57:52.560 --> 57:55.880]  another way of doing it where they build a quote new internet and then attack the
[57:55.880 --> 58:01.320]  old internet that's the key to this whole article is that they they they've
[58:01.320 --> 58:05.240]  created new internet that's quote safe but you don't have any rights on it that
[58:05.240 --> 58:09.600]  because they're not attacking it and they just phase out the old one and then
[58:09.600 --> 58:13.840]  internet ID and I know that's in there we need to really state the key to it
[58:13.840 --> 58:18.120]  people understand is kill the old internet with all this weight collapse it
[58:18.120 --> 58:21.360]  like to collapse societies and then bring in their solution just like they've
[58:21.360 --> 58:25.240]  collapsed Libya with al-Qaeda in the last four years now they're gonna send in
[58:25.240 --> 58:29.640]  US troops are taking control of it and then have some fake skirmishes with the
[58:29.640 --> 58:32.840]  al-Qaeda groups they're openly funding but the al-Qaeda will actually kill our
[58:32.840 --> 58:36.440]  troops it's real it's just the globalists are running both puppets
[58:36.440 --> 58:39.880]  we'll be back with the second hour stay with us have a special guest joining us
[58:39.880 --> 58:45.120]  tons of news we haven't even skimmed the surface I didn't cover a lot I'll give

[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:42.120]  we are now in to our number two and we have the moves to censor and kill
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:45.880]  the internet as we know it we've been breaking down we have new breaking news
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:50.600]  where all over the country locals are saying why are you getting giant brand
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:57.400]  new war tanks wheeled war tanks and why are you setting up checkpoints and why
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:01.960]  are you buying all these guns and weapons for us well wisconsin police

[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:13.760]  spell negative public perception of use of military domestically don't run we
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:19.840]  are your friends to quote mars attacks or wake of the tank with the Bradley
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:23.080]  fighting vehicle smashing and shooting the people they were saying this is not
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:27.080]  an assault this is not a salt come out with your hands up and they kill them to
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:31.280]  teach them a lesson including the little kids when the ATF opened fire on the
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.120]  Davidians as a PR stunt the vidians fought back the ATF put their hands up
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:40.160]  they let them retreat and they came back in circle them for 15 plus days and then
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:45.880]  burned the place down with the children inside so that's what's happening and
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:50.760]  we're gonna have pharmacist Ben Fuchs on GCN hosts one of my favorite guests
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:56.640]  because I heard him a few weeks ago on his own show breaking down the epigenetics
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:02.760]  and quoting the studies he always sends us great bibliographies of what he
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:08.360]  breaks down about how the conspiracy to not breastfeed is so incredible and to
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:13.400]  end the human family as we know it people have much smaller brains their
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:17.480]  brain damaged now you you might have had 170 IQ but you didn't get breastfed so
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:21.920]  it's a hundred and twenty and and I'm not saying you're a bad person because
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.480]  you weren't breastfed but this is a big deal and this is something people need
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:30.960]  to know so we'll look at epigenetics and how how we're treated as a child as a
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.320]  baby expresses the genes that are already in us they always debate is it
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:40.680]  nature or is it nurture and those are the two schools well it is nature but
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:46.000]  nurture is how those genes are activated and that's been proven now they've
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.040]  encoded the genes it's incredible it's not just in mammals and the globalists
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:55.480]  are trying to program our genes to keep them from expressing certain ways so
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:00.160]  they're not even engineer us they can engineer our genes from the outside they
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:05.400]  don't have to change it before the embryo forms in the zygote they don't have to
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:09.760]  change it in genetic engineering of the sperm in the egg or the systems they
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.360]  use and they've got literally thousands of chimeras part monkey part human
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:17.640]  that's in the news today in fact that's in my stack I was trying to find it the
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:21.960]  era of chimeras scientists fearlessly create bizarre human animal hybrids
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.960]  we're gonna talk with Ben Fuchs about what they're not doing that's natural
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:32.680]  like breastfeeding and stuff and then what they're moving ahead with to break
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:37.200]  down monkeys that are part jellyfish dogs that are part human they've got fish
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.080]  they've got more than 50 different plants animals insects in them and this is
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:47.080]  causing zoological spread cross species jumping of things that shouldn't I mean
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.760]  this is definitely beyond the island of dr. Maroo but just like I told you they
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.320]  were having put in brain chips and troops 10 years ago now it's declassified
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:58.040]  they've been doing it for 10 years like I told you or just like I told you they
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:02.640]  were taking baby's blood I told you that 1996 because a nurse at a military base
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:10.120]  gave me all the documents it took more than a decade until 2006 that broken
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:15.680]  Texas and in Minnesota my listeners sued found out it was true and it goes in a
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:20.840]  secret Rockefeller brothers Cold Springs Harbor you in facility the most
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:24.840]  famous eugenics facility in the world after the Kaiser Velhom Institute is
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:29.720]  Cold Springs Harbor that's the genome project under IBM your blood goes there
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:36.400]  and it's for bio weapons they can create a bio weapon that just kills you they've
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:41.480]  got it all and that's the main master center they've got a big underground base
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:46.080]  there the NSA is freaking out over that statement yes I have the secret intel
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.280]  and the globalist know it that's why they have all my phones tap everything
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:55.240]  else doesn't matter I got this information a long time ago we'll be
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:58.960]  right back ladies and gentlemen stay with us
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:03.920]  a chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.400]  this year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:11.360]  contaminate what are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:15.080]  water it's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents my
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.520]  friends water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:21.820]  protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:25.960]  tap water on average the county said it sprays with glyphosate at least once a
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.840]  week you filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:34.960]  worldwide remove pesticides herbicides chloramines hydrofluorosalic acid
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:39.560]  sodium hexafluorosilicate all right it is in teams and coffees and waters and
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:43.320]  breads and toothpaste it is our responsibility to protect our families
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:47.000]  the establishment's not going to do it it's time to take action it's time to
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.040]  filter our water visit info or store.com and use promo code water to get

[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:04.480]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:08.000]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.040]  outside this toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:16.240]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:20.080]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:24.240]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:28.000]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.400]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:35.080]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to

[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:10.880]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:44.080]  my friends I want to try to boil this down very calmly for you and for myself
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:48.840]  I want to just get this out what we have is a breakaway civilization the
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:55.120]  establishment the Bilderberg group the Davos group openly call themselves
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:02.960]  technocrats and the vein that runs through all of their public communications
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:07.960]  is that they are the anointed they are the high priests of the world they are
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:12.680]  the scientists they are going to get life extension technology they are going
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:17.680]  to become God they are going to merge with the singularity and that you the
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:24.200]  profane do not deserve to go into this new age technocracy that they're
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:39.480]  building and we are going to become gods period if you don't like it get off you
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:43.640]  don't have to contribute you don't have to participate if you're going to
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:53.960]  interfere with me becoming God I have big trouble then we'll have warfare that's
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:59.560]  Richard's seed big physicist and that's the standard thing that Bill Joy wrote
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.680]  and why the future doesn't need us article 14 years ago for Wired Magazine
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:09.280]  the owner of Sun Microsystems the chairman he said I was in a meeting with
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:15.240]  200 elite top tech company owners and the discussion over the weekend was do we
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:20.600]  kill everybody or we let people just be entertained like in the movie Wally and
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:25.480]  just lay around with robots servicing them all day you know taking care of
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:29.640]  them bringing us Pina Coladas and the elite have made the decision that
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:34.760]  that's a waste of resources and that they need to decide how to just get rid
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:42.920]  of us as humanly as possible of course so that they can ascend and transcend in
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:50.840]  the transcendence and safeguard the earth as the new Johnny Depp movie basically
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:57.840]  sells a guardian nanotech to control everything and and and reduce the
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:03.040]  population there's an article up on info wars dot com by Michael Schneider
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:07.200]  excellent writer and he has a big bibliography here from the Daily Mail the
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:18.680]  Associated Press the independent slate dot com the age dot com and the reason I
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:21.920]  mentioned the bibliography of this the sources is whenever I talk about this
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:27.200]  we invariably get emails and calls and I'm crazy that's how ignorant the public
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:34.880]  is they don't know that for 50 years they've been cloning rabbits they don't
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:42.720]  know that it was declassified in the mid 90s that 20 years before in laboratories
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:47.960]  in South Korea and in England in other places they had cloned humans in the
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:55.280]  test tube but reportedly killed the embryo before it grew and then they
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:01.240]  passed laws saying yes cloning's banned if you you know get rid of it at say a
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:06.440]  month old and they've got facilities growing humanoids and harvesting it
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:12.440]  but they don't have rights because they've got pig DNA rat DNA guinea pig
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:18.400]  DNA fish DNA lizard DNA it's beyond anything I remember seeing a
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:23.200]  Washington Post footnote about 10 or 12 years ago and I was on coast to coast
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:28.160]  a.m. with a guy named Ian Punnett and I brought it up and he was freaking out and
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:32.520]  he goes I want to see where there's pharmacological crops that grow HIV
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:38.000]  virus in them in Texas he looked it up and freaked out there it was people didn't
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.480]  know back then they had crops can grow anything you can program a plant to grow
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:45.800]  basically anything you know you know grow chemicals whatever you want viruses
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:52.680]  whatever you want and then I said well if you think that's a big deal then we're
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:57.280]  gonna go to our guest you know I said I saw a Washington Post article where it
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:03.760]  mentioned they had human z's at a Costa Rica US government funded lab but
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:08.320]  because it's part chimpanzee part human and has no rights and he freaked out
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:11.920]  about that we went and pulled it up and there it was and I don't blame people
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:18.040]  going oh come on you know this is going on folks and I told the story a hundred
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:25.120]  times or more but my wife was pregnant so it was about 12 years ago and I was at
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.400]  the pizza place and a guy poked me in the back I said I used to listen to you
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:32.440]  but you're a liar now you know I went to UT and have a biology degree there's no
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:37.520]  such thing as a part goat part spider and I just said yeah there is and get out
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:39.920]  of my face
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:48.320]  and I still get that you know it's like the globalist her own record saying they
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.800]  put fluoride in the water to brain damage you and your family they should
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:57.760]  all be arrested eco science why science are their public not caring of 91% of
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:02.400]  the 400 plus reactors are leaking worldwide they don't care their public
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:07.560]  saying your kids belong to them their public if you go back to the 50s knowing
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:12.080]  that when they gave babies formula that it wasn't even set up right not to
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.200]  mention the colostrum and the antibodies and the fact that it's your
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:19.440]  mother's vaccines and her entire mitochondrial history of immunities
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:25.400]  passed on from women going back into the fogs shrouded past that they're
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:29.880]  breaking that chain of literal programming juice and and pharmacist
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:33.360]  Ben Fuchs is a top formulator in the country and compounding pharmacists and
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:36.480]  smarter than most doctors I know most doctors I know say talk to a pharmacist
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:40.000]  well that's what we talked to he can quantify with the studies I have a stack
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:46.800]  of them how the first three months of milk is literally activation juice and it
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:53.040]  doesn't carry the memories the race memories it activates the race memories
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:57.680]  and it's also designed for the stress the woman's under what is she facing
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:03.600]  what's happening with her will affect her milk to then program the baby with the
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.960]  type of threat they're facing to select the genes to be flipped on that's in the
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:13.680]  studies now how now how nanotech is that of God or the universe whatever you
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:19.560]  want to call it that whatever the woman's going through in her pregnancy or
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:22.400]  stress whatever she's going through whatever she's got deficiencies in
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.360]  everything while the baby's in utero through the percent of the body's
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:29.960]  trying to get the baby ready for whatever it's facing in the environment
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:36.560]  when the baby comes out the milk is now programming for whatever the woman's
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:40.400]  facing through the baby to activate genes and that's in major studies he's
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:47.760]  here to join us just on that one area you you go look at the major in fact you
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.720]  guys can do this run to H.E.B. and buy me a couple of the establishment
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.040]  formulas right now I got some I don't have any cash left on my wallet just
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.400]  grab it from Weldon run there quick before a few excess to leave us 20
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:01.040]  minutes in the next hour because I've been to do this and I forgot to I want
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:04.680]  to show you what we've done on air before with Mike Adams and he came in I
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:09.840]  mean it's like 50% sugar or high fructose corn syrup 25% more sugar
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:14.240]  75% sugar almost no fat and then it's not in the type of fat you need then it's
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:19.200]  soy that basically programs the male babies to be feminine I mean we've got
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:25.200]  the expert here to join us brightsideben.com he joins us now to break
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:30.680]  this down but imagine the diabolical nature of taking I mean women have
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.720]  breasts for a reason all mammals have them whales you name it it's not a
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:39.160]  conspiracy theory babies need mother's milk that's why genetically men like
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:42.680]  women with nice breasts because you know genetically we're saying that can
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:46.240]  produce a lot of milk you know women with wide hips that's your Marilyn Monroe
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:50.360]  this is a woman that can have kids this is a woman that's feminine wants to take
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.560]  care of babies well they don't want women feminine they don't want men to be
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:58.000]  warriors they're attacking the species like the globalist or an alien
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.200]  programming group and I don't believe that's what they are but I'm saying it
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:06.200]  might as well be that they're psychopaths who were alien to the normal human
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:10.160]  activity who have scientifically decided to destroy us pharmacy's been fixed we're
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.760]  skipping this network break it's so important thank you for joining us you've
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:19.280]  heard my layman's breakdown of these reports we're going to go over break it
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:23.400]  down for us well here's the bottom line epigenetics means power and it means
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:29.600]  power for us genetics the the notion of genetics has to do with destiny it says
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:32.720]  that whatever is in your genes is the way you're going to be and this is one
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:35.840]  of the most disempowering ideas in all of health and in all of biology the idea
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:40.120]  of epigenetics and the idea of a transcendent level of control over the
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:43.760]  genome which is what breast milk represents by the way puts the power
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:48.480]  back in the hands of the individual takes the power away from the hands of the
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.880]  the Leviathan as I call it the beast the state the model however you want to
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.800]  term it and this is one of the most powerful ideas that we have in all of
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:59.160]  health and something that we we've known about for a long time but because of
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.680]  the hegemony of the medical model the hegemony of the medical professionals
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:06.320]  most people believe that what is ever gonna whatever is in their genes is the
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:09.400]  way that they're going to be how many times you've heard people say oh it's
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:13.720]  just in my genes oh that's my genetics oh it runs in the family the notion that
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:17.600]  there is a control point that is transcendent or epi that's what the word
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:23.120]  epi means to genetic destiny is a powerful powerful idea for the individual
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:26.400]  and it's something that we want to exploit you were bringing you bringing
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:32.520]  bringing to to the forefront the idea of breast milk breast milk is an epigenetic
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:37.840]  vehicle that is designed to turn genes on and off in response to the environment
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:42.720]  that both the mother is confronting and the baby is confronting please mothers
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:47.360]  breast milk is a divine programming source out at the nail on the head you
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:51.560]  call it a pro a high-tech programming device that's really what it is it's a
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:56.080]  divine programming device that's designed to keep a baby healthy we know that
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:01.200]  epigenetic fast women's breasts are magical that's right there everything
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.720]  about them is magical but what they secrete is especially magical in terms
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.880]  of epigenetics the factors in breath milk the breast milk aside from the
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:11.080]  nutritional factors you know you can get formula that has the vitamins and you
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:14.480]  can get formula that has the minerals and some of the cofactors but these
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:17.720]  epigenetic factors are things that we've just begun to understand over the
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:21.360]  last 20 or 30 years formulas don't contain those it's literally full of the
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:24.840]  antibodies everything and again quantifying this from the studies but
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.600]  I want you to expand on it with your expertise studying this for years
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:31.600]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs joining us is that suddenly there's all these genetic
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:36.000]  disorders and people are suddenly you know 10,000% increases in and pediatric
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.480]  children's cancer is 3,000% in breast cancer and they go oh it's because you
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:43.320]  have bad genes well of course if you're not getting what you need you are
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:47.400]  predisposed in your genes to malfunction this way if you don't have the
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:50.080]  building blocks and you weren't breastfed and you're getting if you're
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:54.120]  and said you're given a bunch of deadly vaccines they want their system I mean
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:58.160]  why should anyone get a hepatitis shot at birth I mean is the baby gonna be
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:02.560]  having you know sex or is the baby gonna be injecting heroin and it's
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:06.280]  incredible breast milk is the best vaccination you could get is God's
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:10.400]  vaccination breast milk protects us from fatty liver disease it protects us from
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:13.960]  autoimmune disease it protects us from cancer it protects us from cholesterol
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:16.520]  and blood fats it protects us from heart disease these are factors that are in
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:19.280]  breast milk that the baby is going to get and that are going to impart
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:24.200]  protection for the baby for the rest of the baby's life this is so important and
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:28.000]  that doesn't even include the psychological benefits the psychological
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.440]  benefits to these epigenetic factors we know epigenetic fact lack of these
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:37.280]  epigenetic factors can result in in stress diseases and in alert helplessness
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:41.680]  emotional disorders autism schizophrenia this is above and beyond the
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:45.520]  the protection that we get from physical malage while you're talking I'm
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:50.580]  showing mainstream research papers from prestigious universities this is well
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:54.400]  known that this has been well known I will graduate pharmacy school in 1986 I
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.480]  had professors telling me about epigenetics back then today we're
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:01.280]  starting to hear about it more and more but we've known about a control point of
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:05.280]  the genetics a control point to genes for 50 or 60 years in fact the word
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:09.160]  epigenetics was corn coined in the 1950s I believe so these are not new
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:12.760]  ideas these may be new ideas to the mainstream but these are not new ideas
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:18.320]  to biologists I'm showing dot gov the Centers for Disease Control the NIH you
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:22.640]  name it they're all admitting this well geneticists know yeah this idea of one
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:26.280]  gene one protein one gene one disease today I was reading about how they found
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:29.320]  the gene for baldness you know you hear this every once in a while yeah oh they
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:33.240]  found the gene for Alzheimer's disease they found the gene for cancer there is
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:37.680]  no one gene for baldness or for Alzheimer's disease for cancer genes
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:41.400]  turn on and off based on epigenetic factors that are nutritional that are
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:45.160]  emotional that are psychological and what's more and this is very important
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:48.840]  when it comes to things like genetic mod genetically modified organisms genes
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:54.040]  relate to other genes and turn on and off via communication with other genes
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:57.840]  so when you manipulate the genome by pulling in pulling out genes or putting
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:02.360]  in genes you're manipulating the entire genome and you never have no idea what
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:05.920]  you're going to be getting this is such an important idea for for scientists who
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:10.440]  to be so glib with the fundamental component of the intelligence of life
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:15.320]  is what which is what the genome is is well obviously mammals need their
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:19.320]  mother's milk and they've pretty much got up to the point where they harass
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:23.360]  women that try to breastfeed the media acts like it's weird I mean if they
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:27.000]  have their way someday it will be a conspiracy theory to say that women
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.340]  ever even breastfed or even gave birth notice how they like 60 some percent of
[01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:35.000]  hospitals now force women to have cesareans because then every other
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.640]  baby they get to do that it affects the child yeah I mean it's just there is a scam when
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:44.520]  a baby comes out of the womb it's coated with bacteria and that bacteria
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.880]  become that baby's personal health guardians for the rest of that baby's
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:51.720]  life that bacteria those bacteria that coat the baby as an as it leaves the
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:55.000]  womb and enters into the world they get into the baby's mouth they go into the
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.480]  baby's digestive tract they implant in the baby's womb those bacteria protect a
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:04.920]  baby from colon cancer from digestive distress from heart disease from from
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:08.920]  emotional disorders from autism and when you have a baby who's born cesarean
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:11.640]  he's completely deprived of those bacteria so what are the what do the
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:14.440]  doctors tell you we'll just give you a little supplement we'll give you a
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:17.640]  little probiotic we'll give you a little formula this is not the divine way this
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:21.880]  is not the way that nature has intended it has intended babies to be born into
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:26.040]  the world it's no wonder Alex that we're confronted with the largest chronic
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:29.720]  disease crisis in the history of mankind despite the fact that we have the most
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:33.880]  medicine it's no wonder people are on antibiotics from birth till death it's
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:37.400]  no wonder people glow in the dark now and you know look like they can't even
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:40.840]  pick up a five pound weight oh and we haven't even gotten to the bisphenol
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:45.560]  a and the pesticides and the toxic effects of epigenetics the the
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:48.600]  relationship between poisons the relationship between pollutants the
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:53.160]  relationship between prescription medications and the genome we know
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:55.960]  we'll get into that in the next segment but right now as I heard your show a few
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:59.320]  weeks ago you were breaking all down get into the science the different co-factors
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:03.160]  that's in the breast milk so people understand how important this is that
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:06.360]  the major wiring of the brain happens the first two years
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.880]  uh you know and then up to age five it's fully mapping
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:14.520]  I mean this is the time they tell put kids on low fat diets well it's trans fats
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:17.800]  that are bad don't children need more fat than adults
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:20.840]  heck yes and what's more they need more cholesterol than adults how do you like
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:23.640]  that cholesterol which we've been talking about and you know you and I've been
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:26.520]  talking about it for for probably three or four years now about how poor
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:31.080]  cholesterol is cholesterol is a prime building substance not just for for cells
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:34.920]  not just for muscles but for the brain and for the nervous system Alex it's
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:39.400]  like there's a a conspiracy to destroy our minds there's a conspiracy to
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:43.960]  destroy our ability to think clearly there's a conspiracy to destroy the
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:47.640]  prefrontal cortex the executive center the choice center the part of our brain
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:51.560]  that makes us human there's a conspiracy to promote the lizard brain the
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:55.240]  reptilian brain the the survival brain the fear brain the part of our brain
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:00.280]  that shuts down our ability to heal and to thrive we are in survival mode
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:03.560]  psychologically we're in survival mode emotionally and now we're in survival
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:07.080]  mode epigenetically and physically through manipulation of the genome
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:10.040]  through prescription drugs through poisons in the environment
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:13.720]  and through lack of information through misunderstandings that promote the idea
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:18.200]  that we have to be what our genetics say we are the fact of the matter is you go
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:22.520]  to any geneticist and they'll tell you that this idea of one gene being
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:26.520]  related to one protein or one gene being related to one kind of specific
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:30.840]  physical feature is not true it's simplistic and it's ignorant and what's
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:36.040]  worse it's a control trip and it's a a profit center as well because it
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:40.040]  allows pharmacology of pharmaceutical companies to come up with medications
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:43.720]  that manipulate the genes and this is what the latest minute the latest
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:46.920]  pharmaceuticals do they work at the genetic level
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:51.880]  be approved with this idea that by pharmacologically addressing the gene
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:57.240]  by pharmacologically changing the gene you can impart health how the heck can
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:01.880]  a human being who knows nothing about the genetics of the body which is
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:05.880]  really basically what we know we one to two percent of the gene well just
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:09.640]  really let me interrupt just look at what antibiotics were great but over
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:12.440]  used all the nightmares they created look at how
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:14.760]  everything ends up turning out to be worse down the road
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:18.360]  now they've got thousands of facilities with gene guns as you know
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:22.440]  just randomly splicing RNA DNA chimeros i mean
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:25.960]  talk about that some what do you make of cross yeah
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:29.480]  yeah well hg wells where how do you like the fact that hg wells wrote the
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:34.040]  island of dr. morrow in 1896 a hundred and a hundred and twenty years ago he
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:37.480]  knew that there would be this idea of manipulating
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:40.760]  genomes of different animals building things together creating these
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:45.320]  atomic wars in 1900 he was a master of limonade isn't that amazing how he knew
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:48.280]  all the stuff it's crazy but the idea of chimeras is
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:52.280]  really what we're confronting this is the the next likely step in genetic
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:56.920]  modification we have gmo plants which are basically chimera plants how
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:01.160]  how big a leap is it to chimera animals how big a leap is it to chimera
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:05.240]  ha human oids for that matter they've already done it they don't have any
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:07.960]  rights they just keep them in laboratories it's on record
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:11.000]  but i mean you know the animal rights groups talk about animals having rights
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.840]  which i agree they do have some obviously
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:16.120]  how we treat animals is how we treat ourselves especially the higher order
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:19.640]  elephants dogs you name it but but what about these chimeras
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:23.800]  don't they have rights these pigs that have human genetics in them
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:28.760]  right chimera rights that's the next step you know i mean we have we it truly
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:32.360]  is a a scary world that we're confronting but alice i'll tell you i
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:36.200]  am i've said this so many times we can't let fear get the best of us we've
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:39.560]  got to expose this we've got to not participate in the
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:42.920]  system that is not designed for our benefit it's designed for as you said
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:47.400]  a select few an elite few and we have to refuse to participate in this
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:51.000]  in all ways we have to stop eating the corporate swell we have to stop
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.280]  participating in the medical model we have to begin to understand how to
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:58.840]  control our own bodies because at the end of the day we do have no no i agree
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:01.240]  in the next segment i want to get into solutions but
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:03.480]  and i want to be clear and i'm not saying you're saying this but i want to be
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:06.840]  clear i'm not fear mongering i want people to know
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:10.840]  how bad it is like telling my neighbor hey your house is on fire
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:14.600]  right you have to know exactly because people you know we're already
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:19.720]  deep into this we are deep into this that's absolutely the case i mean what
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:22.760]  by the time the lay public hears about something it's already
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:26.440]  been in the in the scientific literature for decades sometimes for three or four
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:28.920]  even five decades so if you hear about something in the
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:31.800]  new york times and the daily news or in time magazine or newsweek you can rest
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:34.840]  assured that scientists have been discussing this in the literature
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:38.040]  for decades and it's the same with epigenetics and genetics
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:42.040]  genetics the the genome was discovered in the 1950s epigenetic
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:45.960]  ideas of epigenetics was discovered shortly thereafter today we know that
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:49.400]  our genes blink on and off like christmas tree lights but still
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:52.360]  not only does the average person not understand this the average
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:56.440]  medical professional doesn't understand this that our genes are as flexible as
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:59.320]  our environment and this is the beautiful thing about epigenetics
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:03.160]  epigenetics are the way is the way that the genes
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:06.360]  read the environment could it become a drug to have
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:11.480]  lactating women start selling their colostrum to people that never had it
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:13.960]  even though you won't get your family's genetic history
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:17.560]  you will get the genetic history of those people you know if you think breast
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:20.920]  milk is powerful and breast milk is powerful medicine colostrum
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:25.320]  is is the breast milk of the breast milk it's the it's the core of the breast
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:28.760]  milk is the most concentrated food on the planet i want you to describe what
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:31.560]  comes out the first few days then the weeks and months and then i want to
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:35.160]  get into solutions and then also want to look at what you're saying about
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:40.760]  epigenetics the negative stuff what is the bisphenol a doing what is the
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:44.360]  other chemicals out there like the glyphosate what is it doing
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:47.160]  with our genes well they admit it's flipping on the breast cancer
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:51.480]  we'll be right back with Ben Fuchs stay with us we're on the march the empires

[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:18.840]  this with some people they might call you names or they just want to talk about
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:23.400]  sports are so poppers i say so what there's a battle going on out there
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:28.040]  right now the ammunition is information and the soldiers are you it's time to

[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:23.800]  at 275 pounds versus 225 pounds and it is just night and day ladies and
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:27.240]  gentlemen the same amount of exercise i mean
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:31.480]  five years ago i started swimming two miles a day some days trying to jog
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:35.400]  trying to work out and i wasn't i mean i'd battle and lose 10 pounds
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:38.840]  and it was all not having the proper supplements
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:41.720]  so the longevity products info wars health dot com
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:45.560]  brought me a long way and they're a big part of it but the info wars life
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:47.800]  products are really bringing me the rest of the way
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.080]  i mean i still work till 2 a.m some mornings i still go out and do stuff i
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:54.040]  still fly to you know places and don't sleep
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:58.520]  and this stuff literally is more important to me than coffee now we do
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:02.760]  sell high quality organic uh shade grown volcanic
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:05.560]  coffee from southern mexico the wake of america coffee

[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:13.320]  recommended dose for a while and took half of it because i couldn't handle it
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:16.760]  now i've gotten where i've got a tolerance i take it morning noon and
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:24.440]  night and here is my noon dose at 1237 central
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:28.200]  and then we have the proprietary survival shield nascent iodine
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:32.040]  there's no other iodine like this anywhere there will be a new iodine
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:36.120]  starting next week that i've i've got to say folks i wouldn't
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:39.720]  even call an improvement it's different we're going to break all that down but
[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:43.560]  this is simply amazing this is what helped my skin get healthier
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:49.480]  i wasn't getting tans when even though i go out the sun i would just burn
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:53.080]  until i started taking this type of nascent iodine
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:56.200]  and i've heard pharmacist ben fuchs talking about it himself so when i was
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:59.320]  looking at the best products to come out with i did a deep research
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:02.760]  trying out a bunch of brands trying out different systems and then i found what
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:05.880]  pharmacist ben fuchs was about to come out with and i was like wow
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:09.000]  this is the way to go it turned out a lab had been making it for 20 years but
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.320]  nobody knew about it so the survival shield nascent iodine
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:17.320]  available at info wars life dot com there's a bunch of other great products
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:20.600]  the lung cleanse you name it so good for my allergies

[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:25.960]  listeners and viewers like you supporting us all right uh going back to
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.880]  pharmacist ben fuchs i'm going to shut up now
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:32.120]  as much as i can for the balance of the hour get into what's in colostrum
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:36.040]  what's in breast milk and then get into other epigenetics
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:41.240]  positive things people can do from your deep research and all the studies you
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:43.160]  sent me well we'll talk about the positive things here
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:46.280]  in a second uh by the way there's a whole new branch it's not that new it's
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.080]  probably about 20 years old of uh science called
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:53.720]  nutrigenomics which is the study of the effect of nutrients
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:57.080]  on the genome as it turns out nutrients are powerful epigenetic factors as a
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:00.040]  matter of fact most women know that when they're pregnant they got to take folic
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:03.160]  acid to prevent birth defects well as it turns out
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:07.240]  folic acid is an epigenetic factor that protects against a major birth defect
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:10.440]  called spina bifida so epigenetics has been used
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:13.560]  even by the medical mainstream without even calling it epigenetics we'll talk
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:17.080]  about that here in a second this idea of colostrum and breast milk you know you
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:19.080]  ask what's in colostrum what's in breast milk
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:22.600]  we know of nearly a hundred different compounds that are in in colostrum and
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:26.120]  breast milk and that's just the ones we know about chances are we'll find more
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:29.480]  as we do more and more research colostrum being a form of breast milk
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:33.560]  being a form of of mother's milk it's the first mother's milk
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:37.800]  the first milk that the baby gets and like breast milk it contains
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:40.920]  immune regulating substances substances that build the immune system
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:43.720]  something called prp proline rich peptide
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:47.480]  that's a hormone like substance that stimulates the thymus which is the
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:51.400]  body's main immune gland this idea of the immune system being
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:54.520]  built by mother's milk and by colostrum is very important to recognize and by
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:58.200]  the way when i say the immune system i mean the digestive system as well
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.840]  because the digestive system and the immune system are basically
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:04.440]  the same system some 80 percent of your immune activity is located in the
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:08.520]  digestive tract see when babies are born when mammal babies are born
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:11.800]  because mammals tend to have big heads and especially humans have big heads
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:15.720]  they have to come out of the womb prematurely so human beings and mammals
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:18.920]  come out of the womb prematurely which means they're
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:22.760]  specifically their immune system and their digestive system
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:26.600]  are not fully matured and this is a big problem because
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:29.800]  toxins get into the body through the digestive tract an immune system that is
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:33.960]  suppressed will compromise the baby so nature has devised this
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:37.080]  wonderful system for growing the digestive tract for
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:40.680]  supporting the growth of of the of the immune system
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:43.160]  for supporting the growth of digestive tract and supporting the healthy immune
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:46.200]  system and that is what mother's milk and that's what breast milk is
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:48.760]  and that's why when you say what's in breast milk it's hard to quantify all
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:51.000]  the different things because there are so
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.360]  many of these growth factors and immune factors and
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:58.920]  anti-inflammatory factors and transfer factors and antibiotic like substance
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:01.560]  substance something called lactoferrin something called
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:05.720]  transferrin these are substances that bind iron iron being very important for
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:09.400]  bacteria but that's just junk that came out of the creature that just
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:12.840]  made you right i mean why would this female have anything
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:17.080]  yeah for the creature it literally just just woven its womb
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:20.200]  i mean you're a weirdo to think that babies need
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:23.880]  what came from the place it was just created i mean that's crazy
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:27.320]  Alex we all need breast milk it's not even just babies everybody needs breast
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.960]  milk but especially developing infants who are
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:33.080]  who cells are dividing rapidly and and who can't eat food
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:35.720]  you know babies can eat food that's supposed to be they're not designed to
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:38.120]  be eating food so they nature has designed this
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:42.600]  exquisite system of growth factors and fats and vitamins and minerals
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:46.280]  that are in the breast milk so what's in breast milk you've got growth factors
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:50.280]  immune factors you've got carbohydrates something called oligosaccharide
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:55.320]  something called glycocondigates these are substances sugars
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:58.680]  that adhere to specific sites on the digestive tract and the
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:02.200]  gastrointestinal tract that keep bacteria from getting in
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.400]  you've got bacterial support as i was saying earlier so
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:09.160]  the baby's microbiome that is the bacteria that will live in the baby's gut
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:13.080]  for the rest of the baby's life will implant and proliferate appropriately
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:17.000]  these bacteria produce vitamin d these bacteria make b vitamins
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.920]  these bacteria help fight bad bacteria you know one of the biggest problems we
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:24.600]  have in our culture in terms of health is digestive distress digestive
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:28.200]  disorder some 60 to 70 percent of americans are dealing
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:31.640]  with some kind of digestive stress or digestive disorder 30 percent of
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:34.920]  americans have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease another
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:39.240]  pseudo a sort of digestive problem how much of this is related to the fact
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:42.680]  that babies are being born caesarean how much of this is related to the fact
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:46.360]  that babies are not being breastfed how much of this is related to the fact
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:49.240]  that even if mothers are savvy enough to be breastfeeding they're typically not
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:52.920]  going to be breastfeeding long enough or they're nutritionally deficient and
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:56.360]  their breast milk will be nutritionally deficient how much of our
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:44:00.040]  of this epidemic of digestive disease as well as immune disease as well as
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:02.600]  cancer as well as blood diseases and heart disease
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:05.960]  is related to the fact that we're not getting the breast milk the babies are
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:08.840]  being born caesarean we don't know so anyway going back to all these
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:12.600]  components that are in in breast milk one of the most important are
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:16.840]  prostaglandins prostaglandins are anti-inflammatory factors that keep
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:20.440]  inflammation down we know that almost all disease states have an inflammatory
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:23.960]  component and we know that many of these disease states are initiated
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:27.640]  by inflammation and pro anti-inflammatory factors that are in
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:31.320]  breast milk suppress pro inflammatory factors that are in toxins that are in
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:35.400]  food the foods that we eat that are increased by
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:38.680]  lack of nutrition there are also substances that help
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:41.960]  control the appetite of the baby there's a substance called leptin
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:44.920]  that's found in breast milk leptin is a little protein that suppresses the
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:48.120]  appetite of many folks who are interested in weight loss know about leptin
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:50.680]  and know about strategies for increasing leptin well
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:54.440]  as it turns out breast milk is a wonderful source of leptin to help
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:57.960]  suppress the baby's appetite to help keep the baby satisfied
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:01.800]  there's also special proteins in breast milk that help vitamins
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:05.480]  travel throughout through the blood specifically fat vitamins like vitamin
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:09.000]  d and vitamin e and vitamin a these fatty vitamins don't travel through the
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.120]  blood effectively because they're fatty and the blood is watery they tend to
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:16.120]  glob up so nature has a system of binding proteins which literally
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:19.960]  shuttle these proteins vitamins around through the blood well guess what
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:24.280]  breast milk is a wonderful source of these vitamin binding proteins
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:27.880]  speaking of vitamins the fatty vitamins which are so important for health and
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:31.640]  so important for building tissue are packed in breast milk as are
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:34.760]  all fats breast milk is loaded with that probably 60 percent
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:38.360]  or so of breast milk is fat and by the way you mentioned how
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:43.800]  we've been we've been just hypnotized without this idea of low fat this and
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:46.120]  low fat that and you got to watch your fats and
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:48.760]  you got to stay away from saturated fats today
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:53.000]  savvy nutritionists understand that not only is fat important as a source of
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:58.200]  energy for the heart and for the brain but when you eat fat that allows your
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:01.640]  body to access and transport fatty vitamins
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:05.000]  vitamins d well i even see in mainstream news now what you and others were
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.120]  saying decades ago they're now admitting that so many people
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:11.160]  have Alzheimer's because they're on these low fat diets that's right and you
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:14.920]  need the coconut oil all of it that they got taken out of the popcorn back in
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:18.360]  the early 90s i mean look the system knows what
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:22.360]  they're doing and then you put people on statins that on record literally just
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:25.960]  eat your brain because your brains went out of cholesterol i mean this is
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:29.720]  insane alex the quintessential human
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:33.240]  biomolecule which separates human beings and animals from plants is
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:36.760]  cholesterol if you want to be a fern plant stop making
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:40.280]  cholesterol that's the distinction between a plant which sits in the ground
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:43.400]  and doesn't move women wonder why their bodies fall apart
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:47.000]  is that the skin falls apart and they're putting basically cholesterol creams on
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.960]  their face instead of eating it and by the way one of the most important
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:53.160]  elements for your skin is cholesterol you can't have healthy skin without
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:56.280]  cholesterol many skin diseases like eczema and psoriasis are
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:47:00.840]  located are are associated with problems processing cholesterol in the
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:03.640]  skin in fact one of the best things you could ever do for your skin is eat
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:07.560]  liver and eat eggs and drink milk and eat cholesterol i was about to say i've
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:10.600]  read michelle obama's uh you know because she tells us what our kids are
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:14.360]  supposed to eat in the schools and then the what she wants is what they eat
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:18.520]  and it's literally present food it doesn't ever say gmo's bad or
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:22.040]  aspartame or sugar is bad what they say is bad
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:26.600]  is just any amount of fat period they don't differentiate trans fat
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:30.520]  some artificial fat that they allow us to eat
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:34.760]  but it probably should be illegal instead of the good healthy fat so so what are
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:38.280]  healthy fats even on the even on the food pyramid it says it's just as fats and
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:41.560]  oils it doesn't distinguish trans fats processed fats
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:44.680]  from all the other kinds of fats it's just fats and oils what are some of the
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:47.720]  good fats well as long as it's not processed it's probably a good
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:51.880]  fat saturated fats good fat in spite what you may have heard saturated fats
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:54.920]  are very important for especially for cardiovascular health and even for brain
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:59.560]  health coconut oil fat palm oil fat unsaturated fats gotta be a little bit
[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:03.480]  careful with but we know there's two unsaturated fats called essential
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:07.400]  fatty acids that are unbelievably important for the health of the nervous
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:11.080]  system with the skin fish oil is a not exactly an essential fatty
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:14.280]  acid but it's a derivative of essential fatty acid very very important for
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:18.040]  blood health and for cardiovascular health for brain health for skin
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:22.200]  diseases like eczema and psoriasis fish oil capsules can be very helpful
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:25.160]  omega-6 fats for a long time nutritionists were telling you
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:28.760]  oh you don't need to eat omega-6 fats everybody's got enough omega-6 fats
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:33.080]  well as it turns out that's not true we need omega-6 fats and we need omega-3
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:35.720]  fats and here's the thing about fats that people miss
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:41.640]  alex when you eat fat it helps your body transport and access
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:45.240]  fatty nutrients that are in those fatty foods so
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:49.080]  you eat some coconut oil you eat butter or you eat some kind of fat
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:52.680]  that turns on the bile and that turns on the pancreatic enzymes
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:57.000]  and that turns on the stomach juices that will now allow you to access vitamin
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.280]  a to access vitamin d to access vitamin e
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:04.440]  to access vitamin k so if you're depriving yourself of saturated fat
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:07.720]  if you're depriving yourself of unsaturated fatty acids and essential
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:11.240]  fatty acids you are depriving yourself in essence of fatty
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:16.040]  vitamins and fatty nutrients that can have beneficial effects on
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:19.080]  literally every single system in your body and this is an important distinction
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:22.520]  by the way between watery substances and fatty substances
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:26.200]  watery materials like the b vitamins and vitamin c and electrolytes
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:29.400]  these are nutritional substances that dissolve in water
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:32.760]  these watery substances are used by the body quickly
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:35.960]  because they're watery they go right to work they're used for energy
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:39.320]  they give your heart energy they give your your brain energy let me shift gears
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:43.320]  into another subject what why is iodine you always say it's so important in
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:47.000]  epigenetics iodine is crazy crazy important iodine
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.720]  well first of all if you ask your your average doctor your average lay person
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:52.680]  about iodine they'll tell you about the thyroid and that's true iodine is a
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:56.120]  very important element for the thyroid but it's way more important
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:00.760]  than just for the thyroid iodine is a glandular support vitamin that means
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:04.440]  the uh the various glands in the body the thyroid gland and the adrenal
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:07.880]  glands and the pancreas and the thymus these are a glands
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:12.680]  secret hormones that's what a gland does it's a it's a structure in the body
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:16.040]  that makes and secretes hormones and they need iodine to be that in
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:21.320]  exactly iodine is the juice that makes the glands work that means without iodine
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:24.920]  your glands won't work as effectively which means your hormones won't work as
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:29.240]  effectively and that means nothing will work as effectively so via this
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:33.880]  glandular and hormone connection iodine is important for the functioning of
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:38.520]  every single cell in the body that makes it vitally important and what's
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:41.720]  scary about iodine is if you're not using your nascent iodine if you're not
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:45.160]  supplementing with iodine it's very difficult to get from food
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:48.920]  unless you're eating a lot of seafood iodine is basically an ocean mineral and
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:51.400]  this is why people who live in the middle part of the country where they're
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:54.440]  not getting a lot of seafood tend to suffer from goitre and other iodine
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:57.960]  and they're so obese yeah absolutely it's just the brain is also very
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:02.040]  stay there we'll talk about when we come back clean your house it's a mess

[01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:54.280]  quality iodine out there true nascent turns electric blue on paper not
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:59.320]  not black uh and that's because from what we looked at it's not bound
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:03.640]  and and literally goes right into the bloodstream from what uh
[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:06.920]  dr group and others have said and we've also been tweaking or that and doing
[01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:10.200]  tests with even with an even more super charge type but that'll be announced
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:13.880]  soon but i mean look i was looking at what to
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:16.600]  use i use this for three or four months before i decided
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:20.440]  to roll out with it and mass produce it life changing
[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:27.480]  the clarity the mental clarity my skin i'm able to get a really good chestnut
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:32.280]  tan now with a lot less sun and i don't burn what's going on with the iodine in
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:35.480]  a minute and a half iodine is extremely important for brain
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:38.600]  health in fact one of the leading causes of mental retardation around the world
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:42.600]  in in in babies and children is iodine deficiency as i was saying earlier in
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:45.240]  landlocked countries countries that don't have access to seafood
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:48.840]  iodine deficiency is somewhat common and by the way one of the best ways for
[01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:52.280]  women to protect themselves from breast cancer which now affects one out of
[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:55.400]  every eight women aside from breastfeeding breastfeeding is a great
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:58.360]  way to protect yourself from breast cancer it may be that the epidemic of
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:00.840]  breast cancer is related to lack of breastfeeding or
[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:04.040]  or shortages of breastfeeding but in addition to lowering your risk for in
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:07.560]  addition to a breast a breastfeeding lowering your risk for breast cancer
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:12.040]  iodine is a tremendous way not only to reduce your risk from breast cancer but
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:14.440]  also to reduce the likelihood of fibrous cystic
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:19.800]  breasts to reduce the uh any uh reduce the uh issues with breast diseases of
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:21.880]  any kind to reduce issues with menstrual
[01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:25.560]  crafts and pms for the female reproductive system we know what a big
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:28.920]  problem endometriosis is you go to a doctor for endometriosis it's so
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:32.120]  elementary we don't have breast milk we don't have iodine
[01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:35.080]  i mean they're just targeting us at every level they take out iodine they
[01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:38.440]  add bromine i mean it's a conspiracy let's come back and talk about it

[01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:53.560]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:57.000]  our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:01.000]  but it's not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have
[01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:04.680]  two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air
[01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:09.000]  and most americans spend 90 percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:13.240]  within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the united states
[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:17.240]  well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:20.520]  and don't forget the fact that six million americans live with pets they're

[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:38.360]  southern 20 minutes or so there's so much going on in health
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:41.480]  news i've got so many questions but i notice they stop
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:47.640]  spraying iodine mixed with um alcohol on strawberries to kill bugs
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:52.040]  and sort of spraying what i guess bromine or bromide on it instead
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:55.080]  so and i know back in the 20s they said you know put
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:59.720]  iodine in the salt because people were being brain damage
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:04.120]  birth defects and then they took it out in the 60s
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:07.400]  who is making all these decisions pharmacist been fixed what are you
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:11.720]  things going on i mean clearly it is a program to make us absolutely dumber
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:15.560]  in a box of rocks and it's working too i mean
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:19.160]  look what's happening around the world why are people accepting
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:22.600]  poisoning of the air through chemtrails poisoning of the water
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:26.360]  with antibiotics and drugs poisoning everywhere
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:29.720]  poison the food we eat with pesticides and poisoning the very genetics of the
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:32.920]  food we're eating with gmo crops why do we accept this
[02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:37.960]  how does this even become something that that is that we don't question
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:41.080]  it's because we have been dummified and made docile
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:44.840]  and mollified through fluoride in the water through prescription drugs
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:48.200]  through television and through subliminal programming
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:51.640]  for the last 100 years maybe even more alex
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:55.720]  and it's time we wake up and this is the beautiful thing about what you're
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:58.840]  doing is and what what people like you are doing is we're
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:02.120]  waking people up we're helping people understand that
[02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:05.960]  the ones who are making the decisions for us are government people medical
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:09.080]  people healthcare professionals who are making these kinds of decisions
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:14.520]  don't have our interest in mind the first step is to wake up to this
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:19.160]  the second step is to start to take control we can no longer participate
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:22.520]  in the medical model in doing what the doctor says
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:25.880]  in going and eat you're going driving through mcdonald's and taco bell and
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:28.600]  participating in eating the corporates will in taking
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:32.280]  prescription drugs and even worse submitting our our children to
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:35.880]  prescription drug poisonings we absolutely have to take the ball
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:38.440]  and put it back into our own court by eating
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:42.760]  correct food by eating less food by making sure you're getting on a good
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:46.120]  nutritional supplement program by using the beyond tangy tangerine
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:49.480]  by using the nascent iodine by listening to
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:53.000]  info wars by participating and gathering information for
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.080]  for your own being a researcher yourself understanding that this new world
[02:02:57.080 --> 02:03:00.360]  order that we're living in this globalist culture that we're living in
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:05.960]  does not have the individuals individuals benefits in mind the new
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:09.160]  world order the corporatocracy the global government
[02:03:09.160 --> 02:03:13.640]  is not about the individual the individual has to be
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:17.800]  about the individual and that means we have to do things ourselves
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:21.960]  i believe we can i believe just like you do alex that there is a greatness
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:26.120]  inherent in being a human being this greatness is expressed through our
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:28.600]  genetics this greatness is expressed to ourselves
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:32.520]  this greatness is expressed through our immune system this greatness is expressed
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:36.680]  through our body's ability to heal and regenerate itself on a moment to moment
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:39.720]  basis what we have to begin to do is acknowledge
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:44.520]  our greatness acknowledge the power that's inherent in being a human being
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:49.640]  begin to depend on ourselves begin to become responsible for ourselves and
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:53.720]  let the corporate government let the world new world order die on the vine if
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:58.520]  they if we don't support it if we are complicit in helping it grow
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:02.680]  it will die on the vine and let it good riddance

[02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:24.120]  coming up the next segment i'm going to go over an article at info wars.com
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:30.840]  jamma one of the big medical journals says you're insane
[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:35.640]  give you believe cell phones are causing cancer
[02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:39.880]  i'm not kidding and that the government is refusing to act
[02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:43.480]  gmo's are being used for population control the government suppresses
[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:46.760]  alternative medicine vaccinations cause autism
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:50.440]  hiv was intentionally being sent to african communities
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:55.320]  in africa all of those are true on record and by the way to illustrate that
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:09:00.280]  i'm going to cover more in the next segment here is ap
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:04.280]  the chemicals chosen for bisphenol a the plastic formula
[02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:07.960]  is one of the few that actually has estrogen members it's done on purpose
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:11.560]  uh the glyphosate was chosen it causes absolute
[02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:14.200]  reproductive problems in women on record that's not debated we're going to talk
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:17.960]  to pharmacist ben fuchs and take your calls about that
[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:24.040]  but the printer ink universally has the chemicals in it
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:28.840]  the plastic leaching the everything this is ap
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:32.760]  but remember doctors there's no population control
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:43.400]  the chemical that's added to it how do you pronounce that again
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:50.040]  minnesota bans antibacterial chemical from soaps minnesota bans antibacterial
[02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:53.720]  chemicals from soaps
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:10:01.320]  trickle sand minnesota bans common antibacterial
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:05.080]  chemical from soaps as pressure on industry
[02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:11.160]  grows trickle sand and it says it's in 70 plus percent
[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:16.520]  of the quote antibacterials in soaps period and guess what trickle sand is
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:19.400]  used and estimated 75 but now the food
[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:22.600]  drug administration has said that it needs to be removed
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:28.760]  because guess what it mimics and disrupts hormones critical reading from the ap
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:34.520]  for reproduction and development at least in lab animal tests
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:38.920]  and contribute to the development of resistant bacteria
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:41.960]  and again that shows the government's not pure evil
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:48.680]  the fdj's own scientist in 2001 and then again in 2010
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:53.160]  almost unanimously thousands of toxicologists scientists medical
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:57.400]  doctors sent briefs in saying take hydrofluorosalic acid out of the
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:10:59.400]  water it's brain damaging it doesn't help the
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:03.400]  teeth it's horrible finally there were lawsuits and they
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:06.680]  can't use it as a pesticide it's supposed to be phased out
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:11.080]  kills bucks the old-fashioned bug killer was that i'm going to keep fuchs at the
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:12.760]  bottom of the aisle if i can do it to take these calls
[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:17.480]  the point is is that here's an illustration of how jamma
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:21.560]  the big journal of medicine comes out and says
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:25.560]  doctors look out for conspiracy theorist how do you tell
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:28.920]  well they think gmo's are designed to reduce population
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:32.360]  in all the rat studies they make a sterile by three generations almost
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:37.240]  completely i mean they they piggyback stuff
[02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:40.760]  and all the computers the spy on us they're piggybacking in the gene traits
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:44.600]  and it's come out i mean the keiser velhelm institutes for heaven's
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:48.520]  sakes now is one of the biggest groups in germany with gmo's under a new name
[02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:52.040]  colesprings harbour didn't even change the name of the worldwide
[02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:56.200]  command base of eugenics they're the ones behind all of this
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:12:01.000]  the fertility's dropping the third world fertility didn't drop till 15 years ago
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:04.120]  they started adopting all these chemicals you could say well there's too
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:07.960]  many people well here's the deal let's just be honest about what's going on
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:12.680]  here is my point let's stop being dishonest about
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:15.880]  what's happening and what's going on we're being manipulated
[02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:19.720]  in a petri dish scientifically in the white house science are
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:24.280]  john p. holdren currently serving wrote a book the year i was born 40 years ago
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:27.160]  with other eugenicists paul earlick and his wife
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:31.640]  and earlick calling for world government calling for forced sterilization
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:35.000]  calling for chemicals to be put in the water okay
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.720]  pharmacist ben fuchs i want to go to phone calls and quick questions for you
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:42.760]  but there's an illustration right there of how jamma
[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:46.040]  is coming out saying look out for people that think quote
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:49.240]  shell phones are causing cancer the london guardian came out with a major
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:53.560]  british study last week and said undoubtedly it's causing brain cancer
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:57.080]  on it's a microwave system i mean a gmo's are being used for population
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:00.360]  control of course they're government suppressing alternative medicine
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:04.200]  of course they are we're thinking the fda does vaccinations are causing autism
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:07.880]  they're on record link to it hiv intentionally being sent to african
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:12.600]  america and africa i mean they shot black people up a syphilis
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:16.520]  what do you say to this it's not what i say to it is it's not a theory
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:20.440]  and it's it's definitely conspiracy because it's multiple people
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:24.600]  by definition it's a conspiracy and it's not theoretical the fact of the matter
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:29.560]  is is that government has an interest in maintaining itself like all
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:33.320]  organizations do there is an antagonistic relationship between the
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:38.680]  government and the individual you and i are individuals that means by
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:41.880]  nature there is going to be an antagonistic relationship
[02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:45.320]  between the governed and the governed and that between government and the
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:47.960]  governed and that's unfortunate it's not a theory no
[02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:51.400]  matter what jamma says and how the heck can they dispute the fact that you can
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:55.720]  beneath that electronics like a cell phone can
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:00.120]  will tweak the genome and manipulate the cell which at the end of the day
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:07.160]  is in a bioelectrical system how can it how can it be avoided
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:10.600]  but i mean they knew 30 years ago when they did cell phone studies that it was
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:14.280]  getting rats cancer of course it vibrates the dna at point blank
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:18.360]  range into your brain the contract says don't hold the phones up to your head
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:23.560]  dna is electrical dna emits electrical energy dna is a radio frequency
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:28.200]  transmitter dna emits light dna emits something called bio photons this is
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:31.320]  i'm not making this up go on google and look it up no no that's how jellyfish
[02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:34.840]  call in the dark bioluminescence and your dna is the
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:37.960]  same thing so of course if you have an electrical system
[02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:41.000]  you can interfere with it with another electrical system
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:44.920]  that's not rocket science oh no i mean i mean literally it's a microwave relay
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:47.720]  system you put it right up to your head and they get the brain tumor right on
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:49.800]  the side and what do you think happens when you put it
[02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:52.040]  next to a cell of course you're going to create changes
[02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:55.880]  epigenetic changes by the way and all the changes that we're talking about in
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:14:59.960]  this cell that occur with fluoride that will occur with bpa and an estrogen
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:03.960]  mimickers these are by definition epigenetic
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:07.800]  modifications the gene this is so important alex the gene
[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:11.240]  is responsive to the environment the gene
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:15.400]  listens oh no you just have a gene to get a brain tumor on the side of your
[02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:18.840]  head where you use the phone you deserve to get it because you had bad genes
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:21.480]  no your genes say if you put a microwave oven
[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:24.760]  but don't worry the one in guardian said it's only for those that use it
[02:15:24.760 --> 02:15:28.680]  15 hours a week right i see people with their kids everywhere holding them up
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:31.480]  to their heads and they literally tell me i'm a conspiracy
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:33.960]  theorist how come with the trillions of dollars in the
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:36.760]  last 50 years that we spent on this war on cancer
[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:41.480]  cancer rates are just as high if not higher as they were uh 40 years ago
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:44.600]  well they're a lot higher i've seen a seven-fold increase in women's
[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:49.560]  all right uh um lung cancer that was a really strange report i saw in abc news
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:53.080]  last year why it seems like women are getting hit harder
[02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:57.640]  well women have more fat in their bodies and toxins tend to accumulate in fat
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:01.080]  women are also producing more estrogen and estrogen tends to be a hormone
[02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:04.680]  that's associated with the stress response so between estrogen
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:08.920]  and body fat women are much more and dealing with men for that matter
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:12.520]  women are much more predisposed to diseases like cancer
[02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:19.000]  and autoimmune diseases than men are listen to you kissing up to the women
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:25.720]  oh my goodness oh boy we had to put up with them though too i mean come on
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:29.080]  all right uh let's go to some phone calls here but you heard it
[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:32.440]  i just showed you the london guardian let's put that back up on screen
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:35.080]  but jamma
[02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:40.360]  again that's the journal the american medical association
[02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:44.200]  intensive mobile phone users at higher risk of brain cancer
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:49.720]  study says one of thousands but don't worry it's only 15 hours each month
[02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:54.520]  almost everybody i know is on the cell phone 15 hours a month
[02:16:54.520 --> 02:16:58.520]  they literally give us devices to hard boil our brains
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:02.760]  and then they have jamma making fun of us telling their doctors
[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:05.960]  you know look out of your patient talks like this
[02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:09.640]  this is crazy isn't it fuchs conspiracy theorists i'm
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:13.880]  you know it's not a theory that's all i got to say whatever they said it's not
[02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:17.960]  real there are no brain tumors be quiet right
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:21.320]  pay no attention to the man behind the curtain scott in minnesota you're on the
[02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:24.040]  air go ahead
[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:29.400]  michigan go ahead that was an exciting phone call
[02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:33.320]  let's talk to danie in tennessee you're on the air go ahead
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:36.840]  hey alex how's it going today pretty good brother what's on your mind
[02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:41.960]  i just had a question for ben i've got a 17 year old son he's got um he's a big
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:44.840]  kid but he goes through mood swings and i was just
[02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:49.000]  wanting to know if there was any kind of supplement out there that i could get
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:54.200]  him to kind of even out his uh his mood swings because i'm like
[02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:57.880]  y'all i'm big anti pharmaceutical i don't want him on any kind of
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:02.200]  prescription i would say uh how much exercises are getting
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:06.360]  uh well i like he uh he's very big in the sports he plays
[02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:10.840]  uh three sports in in schools i mean he's very active kid
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:15.160]  and i activity activity sometimes could be a problem because activity
[02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:18.760]  especially if he's he's athletic he's burning through protein when kids are
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:22.760]  burning through protein if they don't have access to a steady stream of protein
[02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:26.040]  they're going to eat a lot of sugar when you eat a lot and by sugar i mean bread
[02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:29.800]  and pasta that messes with the dopamine right that messes with what once you go
[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:33.880]  into low blood sugar then your body starts to secret stress hormone to
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:37.000]  counteract the low blood sugar and that's where you get the jitteriness and
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:41.720]  the anxiety the low blood sugar causes a a drop in mood a slowishness a
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:43.880]  slowness a sluggish yeah do you have him on a super high
[02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:48.840]  power to protein a non soy um alex the uh
[02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:53.400]  the only uh supplement i've got him on right now is the white protein that you
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:56.680]  advertise yeah milk protein is good
[02:18:56.680 --> 02:19:00.280]  pharmacist fuchs you're the expert i iadine b vitamins
[02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:04.600]  essential fatty acids the mighty 90 essential nutrients and more protein
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:07.320]  that's the remedy that's the way i would handle it i would get him beyond tenny
[02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:12.200]  tangerine because at enforce health.com because you know if he's that active
[02:19:12.200 --> 02:19:14.920]  it's either the problem is they're too active or they're not active is what i've
[02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:20.600]  experienced and he might be uh you know uh deficient to something
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:24.120]  and then that can be linked to it correct pharmacist that's exactly right when
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:26.760]  people are when kids are athletic they're burning through protein and the
[02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:29.960]  tendency when you're burning through protein is to start to snack on things
[02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:33.320]  and that's what that's a big problem when it comes to bipolar issues or oh yeah
[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:36.360]  yeah no no no that's why i'm so fat as i used to be a big jocks but i eat
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:39.960]  whatever i wanted right and then you're burning through protein and then you
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:42.680]  were snacking on foods to replace to get energy and then i quit working out
[02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:47.000]  turning the job of the hut taller i hope that answers your question but i mean
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.600]  again i would just try different things thank you so much we're gonna talk to
[02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:55.560]  new jersey and we're gonna talk to randy mariah and

[02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:36.760]  got your question for Ben go ahead absolutely Alex it is so good to talk
[02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:41.480]  to you again we met on September 11th of 2007 and it's been a very long time so
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:45.560]  God bless you and your family uh Ben my wife we just
[02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:48.040]  found out she's pregnant we cannot be more excited
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:51.400]  she's five weeks we already eat extremely healthy as much
[02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:54.760]  farm-to-table as possible as much organic as possible
[02:25:54.760 --> 02:25:58.200]  and just curious if there's a website or a book that I should get to read more
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:01.320]  about these epigenetics and just better food sources and what she should be
[02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:05.320]  taking aside from the folic acid she's already on get Dr. Wallach's new book
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:08.840]  Epigenetics my recommendation my in my opinion it's one of the best books on
[02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:12.680]  epigenetics and the easiest ones to read because he was a top zoologist and
[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:16.280]  kept noticing why the animals were dying in the zoos they weren't getting the
[02:26:16.280 --> 02:26:19.800]  trace minerals but go ahead there's another one called DNA Pirates of the
[02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:22.520]  Sacred Spiral by a guy named Len Horowitz who's
[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:26.360]  really really quite elegant about the idea of manipulation of the genome those
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:29.320]  are two good books that I'd recommend for babies for
[02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:32.680]  moms who are pregnant who are building a baby
[02:26:32.680 --> 02:26:37.880]  protein is the key building substance and it's the one macronutrient that seems
[02:26:37.880 --> 02:26:40.840]  to be deficient in most of our diets making sure that you're on
[02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:44.200]  way pro or your mom the mom is on way protein is a great idea also egg
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:47.480]  protein these are building proteins milk and egg
[02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:50.360]  are building proteins they're designed to build life
[02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:54.760]  plant protein has its upside certainly but it's not designed to build life like
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:57.960]  animal protein well look there's a lot of problems associated with meat and the
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:01.320]  treatment of animals and I get all that the issue is the globalists don't want
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:05.000]  us eating meat for a reason they had Nazi studies
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:08.600]  where they were planning to put the slave populations only on grains and
[02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:11.400]  things they found it made them more docile
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:15.960]  we know chimpanzees that eat meat are bigger more intelligent more vicious
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:19.400]  I mean they want us docile they do not want us eating meat that's right
[02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:24.120]  grains contain natural opiates that's why bread is the opiate of the people
[02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:29.960]  grains contain natural opiates that keep you keep you docile keep you calm
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:35.720]  meat on the other hand has has more dynamic factors animal proteins in
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:38.760]  general and there is a problem of course with ethical treatment of animals I
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:41.240]  agree with that but as far as proteins go for
[02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:44.120]  building a baby think eggs think think way protein
[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:47.240]  also the b vitamins are very important not just folic acid all of the b
[02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:50.440]  vitamins are very very important they're especially important for epigenetics
[02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:54.840]  and for genetic for building a healthy genome zinc is stupendously important for
[02:27:54.840 --> 02:27:57.880]  developing fetuses 50 milligrams a day of zinc copper
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:01.160]  is also important to balance zinc and of course iodine what about where they say
[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:04.920]  you can get too much folic acid you can't from a natural source like spinach
[02:28:04.920 --> 02:28:08.280]  right well it's there's different kinds of folic acid there's the synthetic
[02:28:08.280 --> 02:28:11.000]  kind of folic acid and there's a natural kind of folic acid certainly the
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:14.360]  natural folic acid is better than the synthetic kind I don't know
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:17.240]  about taking too much folic acid because it's water soluble you'll probably
[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:19.240]  excrete it but what you want to do is when you're taking
[02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:23.000]  your folic acid you want to take it with the entire b complex
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:27.000]  last but not least omega 3 and omega 6 essential fatty acids are all very
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:30.200]  important using an essential fatty acid supplement making sure you're eating
[02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:33.800]  fish which has a reputation for being brain food for the fetus is very
[02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:38.120]  important and then coconut oil and some of the satin I love to eat fish at night
[02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:41.320]  because I have great dreams when I eat it it's important for the brain absolutely
[02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:46.120]  choline why is fish fish is almost like a hallucinogen it's
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:48.680]  amazing it contains two very important elements for
[02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:51.560]  the brain actually three important elements for the brain it's got iodine
[02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:56.120]  it's got omega 3 derivatives and it's got something called choline c-h-o-l-i-n-e
[02:28:56.120 --> 02:28:59.080]  which is also a very important epigenetic factor as it turns out for
[02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:01.720]  your mom for the mom to be for the questioner
[02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:04.520]  using choline supplements can also be very important for the brain all right
[02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:07.400]  caller I hope that answers your question you know what Ben if you got to go you
[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:09.240]  got to go can you come back and talk to three more
[02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:13.240]  callers sure all right you're awesome pharmacist Ben Fuchs is our guest long
[02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:16.440]  segment coming up we only talked to him about four minutes because I've got
[02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:20.600]  the satanist audio and video I don't even know what to call this it's coming
[02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:23.560]  up but it illustrates that there's these
[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:27.560]  type of crazy people out there but then the Christians that are going after them
[02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:31.480]  they seem pretty weird too I guess different strokes for different
[02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:35.160]  folks but we got the video now from last Friday in
[02:29:35.160 --> 02:29:38.760]  harvard's satanic debacle lessons from a black mass
[02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:43.240]  cancellation and you'll get to see in here the satanist go crazy
[02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:46.680]  and it just illustrates these people really do exist and they're tuned into
[02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:49.960]  some really bad energy folks we'll be right back stay with us we're on the
[02:29:49.960 --> 02:29:54.200]  march the empire's on the run

[02:31:02.360 --> 02:31:05.080]  information I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk

[02:31:08.280 --> 02:31:11.160]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment
[02:31:11.160 --> 02:31:14.440]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlington's
[02:31:14.440 --> 02:31:18.600]  willing to sell us out for a quick buck. Deciding to take action a company run
[02:31:18.600 --> 02:31:23.000]  by patriots for patriots was born. MyPatriots supply has never taken
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:26.760]  a loan or accepted outside funding. They now operate two distribution
[02:31:26.760 --> 02:31:30.360]  facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and

[02:32:02.200 --> 02:32:05.640]  media for a long time but now they're expanding making the
[02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:09.960]  weaponization even more vicious and deceptive. All the major networks are
[02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:12.680]  state-run. We are partnering this year with the
[02:32:12.680 --> 02:32:15.560]  NFL. The NFL has become a political weapon against
[02:32:15.560 --> 02:32:19.720]  the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare. MSNBC tells us that our
[02:32:19.720 --> 02:32:23.160]  children belong to the state. We have to break through our kind of private idea
[02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:26.520]  that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and
[02:32:26.520 --> 02:32:29.800]  recognize that kids belong to whole communities. It is more important than
[02:32:29.800 --> 02:32:32.840]  ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[02:32:32.840 --> 02:32:36.600]  We are the true media. The establishment dinosaur press
[02:32:36.600 --> 02:32:41.880]  is dying. We are in an information war and we are losing that war. Join us at

[02:33:17.160 --> 02:33:22.760]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:33.480]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:38.280]  The music is fitting for the Satanists that are coming up.
[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:44.120]  People that just want to dominate everyone are all about themselves.
[02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:49.800]  The thing is they're weak. You really know who they are.
[02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:59.240]  They only thrive in societies that for some reason tolerate them.
[02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:02.200]  That's coming up in a few minutes. Pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:07.800]  He is our guest. Let's talk to Barbara in Florida. You got your questions for Ben.
[02:34:07.800 --> 02:34:11.320]  You've got questions. I think he's got answers. Go ahead.
[02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:14.520]  Well, I want to say thank you very much for taking my call. You're awesome.
[02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:21.880]  I want to know about thyroiditis. I have two nodules on my thyroid.
[02:34:21.880 --> 02:34:26.200]  My blood work came back. They say normal, but I would think it's in the higher
[02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:29.480]  range of the normal. I was taking nascent iodine for the past
[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:31.880]  five months. I didn't know if that aggravated the
[02:34:31.880 --> 02:34:37.400]  condition that I may already have. I have a good diet.
[02:34:37.400 --> 02:34:41.480]  I've conquered chronic fatigue and my allergies by changing everything.
[02:34:41.480 --> 02:34:45.880]  Any suggestions? You're dealing with a residual probably from your chronic
[02:34:45.880 --> 02:34:49.000]  fatigue. There's a very important relationship between the thyroid
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:53.000]  and your body's stress gland, which is called the adrenal glands.
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:56.680]  The adrenal glands become overworked and they're constantly kicking in because
[02:34:56.680 --> 02:34:59.480]  you're either eating a lot of sugary foods or you're under a lot of physical
[02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:03.320]  stress or psychological stress. The adrenal glands will become overworked
[02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:06.840]  and the thyroid will slow down in response. Your
[02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:09.880]  thyroiditis may be secondary to a problem with the adrenal glands and that
[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:14.040]  could be a result of whatever was causing the chronic fatigue.
[02:35:14.040 --> 02:35:17.320]  I would guess that you had something going on in terms of your diet, in terms of
[02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:20.920]  your digestive system. That's usually what's involved with
[02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:24.520]  thyroid problems. If you're not taking the iodine or if
[02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:28.040]  you're stopped taking the iodine, I would get back on it. Iodine is extremely
[02:35:28.040 --> 02:35:30.360]  important. Explain that because you have to have
[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:32.920]  that, but if you don't have it, the body will use something else.
[02:35:32.920 --> 02:35:36.920]  The body will use bromine, or chlorine, and most of us are getting
[02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:40.280]  plenty of chlorine through tap water, so if you're not getting iodine, your body
[02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:43.640]  will absorb chlorine and bromine more effectively. In fact, your thyroid will
[02:35:43.640 --> 02:35:45.640]  attempt to use- Now what's the detoxing thing that-
[02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:48.120]  That's very interesting. I was about to say that. That's very interesting, Alex.
[02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:52.120]  When you start taking iodine, all the bromine and chlorine that have been
[02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:55.080]  accumulating in your thyroid, because you didn't have the iodine,
[02:35:55.080 --> 02:35:57.800]  will come out in your blood and you'll start to experience some of the
[02:35:57.800 --> 02:36:00.280]  toxicity associated with excess bromine in the blood.
[02:36:00.280 --> 02:36:03.720]  What's that name? It's called brominosis. It's called brominosis, I think,
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:07.000]  which is what you're thinking of, and some of the signs of brominosis include
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:11.800]  itching and rashes. Yeah, I don't want to get gross here, but
[02:36:11.800 --> 02:36:14.760]  he warned me. Diarrhea, loose stools.
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:18.840]  Well, I mean, not even that, but I was warned by
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:22.360]  Dr. Ed Group. He said, listen, you're a little bit overweight,
[02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:25.800]  you're trying to exercise and all this. He goes, when you take this, two weeks to a
[02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:29.080]  month, you're going to feel very toxic, something about your skin,
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:31.800]  and I don't normally have oily skin or anything, and now I don't.
[02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:35.320]  All this stuff came out. That's right. I felt like I had a hangover for a week
[02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:37.640]  and a half, and then it was all, you know,
[02:36:37.640 --> 02:36:41.960]  passed. But as your body fat was breaking down, as you were losing fat, all the
[02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:43.880]  toxins that were stored in the fat, and that's one of the
[02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:46.760]  one of the things the body will do when it can't handle toxicity, it'll store it
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:48.920]  in fat. It'll store it in fat in the gut, it'll
[02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:51.720]  store it in fat in the breasts, it'll store it in fat in the glutes,
[02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:55.320]  and as you start to lose weight, as you start to lose body fat, all those
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:36:58.120]  toxins will end up in your blood, and that's probably what you expect.
[02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:00.760]  Can it be when you take iodine and you have all those toxins in your thyroid,
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:03.640]  it pumps them out? Correct. Bromin, that's called brominosis,
[02:37:03.640 --> 02:37:07.000]  and that's one of the things that happen when people start to supplement with a
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:10.040]  good iodine supplement, like the nascent iodine. But that's not a reason not to
[02:37:10.040 --> 02:37:13.240]  use the iodine. That's a reason to continue using the iodine
[02:37:13.240 --> 02:37:16.680]  and make sure that the bromine doesn't reattach to the thyroid.
[02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:19.240]  So I'd be staying on the iodine supplements, and by the way, there's other
[02:37:19.240 --> 02:37:22.680]  nutrients that are very helpful for the thyroid, especially the B vitamins and
[02:37:22.680 --> 02:37:26.280]  also vitamin A and also essential fatty acids. And then don't forget about the
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:28.920]  digestive link. There's a very, very important digestive
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:32.680]  connection to thyroid issues, especially grave disease and autoimmune
[02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:34.520]  disease, Hashimoto's thyroid, and other
[02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:37.400]  autoimmune diseases of the thyroid. Ma'am, I hope that answers your question. Does it
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:41.160]  answer your question, Barbara? I would want to know if I should take
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:46.120]  that, take the nascent iodine again, or stop taking it, so that was my question.
[02:37:46.120 --> 02:37:48.520]  I would, that's what I would do. I mean, I'll tell you what to do.
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:51.800]  I mean, maybe she should get it out of salt if she's having an issue with
[02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:54.680]  another brand, or maybe she could talk to her
[02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:57.400]  physicians. What I would tell you, I'm not going to give you advice. I'm just a lay
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:38:01.080]  person here, but I mean, you need iodine, period.
[02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:04.760]  You need iodine. Alex and Barbara, these are essential. We're talking about
[02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:07.640]  something that is essential. It's not optional. You'll die without it.
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:11.320]  You'll die without it, exactly. This is something that the body cannot make and
[02:38:11.320 --> 02:38:14.680]  must have. That's what it means to be essential. So if you deprive yourself of
[02:38:14.680 --> 02:38:17.480]  supplemental iodine, you better, you better be sure you're eating a lot of
[02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:19.960]  fish and not eating a lot of seafood, because that's pretty much the only
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:22.120]  place where you have to concentrate. We're almost out of time, because I gotta play this
[02:38:22.120 --> 02:38:26.120]  piece coming up. Let's go to Randy in Oklahoma. Quick question, Randy.
[02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:30.760]  Okay, real quick here. Way to go, T-Rex. Keep it up, by the way.
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:34.520]  Hey, a question on policy and time of medical
[02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:38.440]  one. On policy, I'm on a ballot for a house district up here in
[02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:42.600]  Oklahoma. I'd like to get in where we can stop the
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:46.920]  domination of the doctor training and the curriculum
[02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:50.840]  in medical schools. Have you seen any groups that
[02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:56.440]  will have any good suggestions for making changes in
[02:38:56.440 --> 02:39:01.400]  that, or am I off track on that? We as individuals have to begin to understand
[02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:05.240]  that this deification of the medical model is self-serving and it's
[02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:09.800]  perpetuated by the medical model itself. It's not in our interests. These are not
[02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:12.920]  deities, and there's nothing divine about the
[02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:17.000]  medical model. In fact, it is anti-divine, and to deify
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:20.360]  the medical model is only in the interest of the medical model itself.
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:23.320]  It's not in the interest of the people. Hey, I'm sorry to other callers. I'm sorry
[02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:26.200]  to Ben Fuchs. I got to get to this piece. Ben, thank you for all the time.
[02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:28.840]  Thank you. The show comes on every day on GCNLive.com
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:32.280]  and syndicated across the country right before this transmission. Thank you so
[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:34.520]  much. It was great having you on. Thank you, Alex.
[02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:38.600]  There goes Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, spent about an hour and a half with us. Now,
[02:39:38.600 --> 02:39:42.840]  this next piece, ladies and gentlemen, is self-explanatory.
[02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:47.560]  This is our own reporter, Dan Badandi, went out to Harvard,
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:50.440]  where they were going to have the Satanic Black Mass when the Satanists ran
[02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:54.920]  around wild, reportedly cursing and yelling and things in the church.
[02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:58.520]  Harvard said, you know what? It's canceled, so this ensued outside between the
[02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:03.960]  Satanist and the Christians, and it just illustrates how many out of
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:09.000]  their gourd people there are out there, and it just turned into a total
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:12.760]  kookfest. But here is inside the mind of these
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:17.080]  Satanists chanting and calling for the blood of the Christians. Here it is.
[02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:20.120]  But I think something more important than me is going on. It seems like those
[02:40:20.120 --> 02:40:23.080]  friendly Christians are not being so friendly, so...
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:27.240]  You want to be loud! You want to be loud!
[02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:36.760]  Was it day of victory? Pristine blood, we'll stop you down, Bill!
[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:38.360]  These people do this to get back at their parents.
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:41.720]  Trumpet of Michael cannot silence the truth!
[02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:45.560]  Trumpet of Michael will not silence the truth!
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:49.560]  The Trumpet of Michael can never silence the truth!
[02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:52.120]  You have the Christian brawl in the horns.
[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:55.480]  You're children! You go to night to cry and you say, oh God!
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:59.080]  Damn, Dundee for the enforcement, nightly news. I'm at Harvard University
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:02.920]  where a black satanic mass is supposed to take place later tonight.
[02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:07.640]  Protesters have gathered here to demand Harvard not to have the satanic mass.
[02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:11.080]  So are you all here protesting? I'm here to pray today.
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:13.960]  The first report was they moved the black mass off a campus,
[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:17.000]  and it was going to go to a restaurant in Central Square.
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.480]  And now we're receiving a report from the New England Cable News
[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:21.640]  that it's been canceled altogether. So we're absolutely delighted.
[02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:25.640]  Apparently protests do have an effect even on Harvard.
[02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:28.760]  Harvard University was actually started as a Bible school,
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:32.200]  a place to train up people to be radical for Christ.
[02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:36.600]  This is a great abomination before God.
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:38.840]  I heard about the satanic ritual about a week ago,
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:41.880]  and I've been following the events and decided to come down here and pray.
[02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:44.520]  And where are you from? Hopkinson, Massachusetts.
[02:41:44.520 --> 02:41:49.960]  We're not going to sit down and let people take what is most sacred to us
[02:41:49.960 --> 02:41:54.840]  and trample it underfoot. Just talking about a, you know,
[02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:58.280]  some free expression or right to assemble or whatever
[02:41:58.280 --> 02:42:02.520]  is really just a subterfuge. They have speech codes at Harvard like
[02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:05.720]  everywhere else, and if they can't recognize this,
[02:42:05.720 --> 02:42:09.000]  it's the same kind of hate speech that they routinely shut down
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.960]  when it is from groups of a traditionalist bent,
[02:42:11.960 --> 02:42:14.520]  then they really have no business talking about these.
[02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:16.680]  These Christians are very well spoken at all.
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:19.880]  It's our job to come out and speak the truth calmly and
[02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:22.280]  do something for God. Some of our other minds.
[02:42:22.280 --> 02:42:27.400]  When he's being attacked. It makes me afraid, not for myself personally,
[02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:31.640]  but for society, for children, for these poor people that come to these
[02:42:31.640 --> 02:42:34.760]  things that are curious, because this stuff's dangerous.
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:38.360]  This is real. It's dangerous. I'm here to witness the black mass.
[02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:41.160]  Yes. Would you want to take part of it? Are you
[02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:44.200]  protesting? I would have taken part in the black mass.
[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:47.960]  Why not? I've taken part in their mass. Why not the black mass?
[02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:51.960]  Hey, how you doing, man? Oh, I'm a girl.
[02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:56.040]  Look how inherently weak these satanists are. I'm good. That other guy just called
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:42:59.960]  me that, so I was confused. I think it's the violation of their rights.
[02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:03.720]  If they wanted to hold a satanic ritual, like again, as I said, as long as it's
[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:07.000]  not hurting anyone, as long as no one's harm during it,
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.160]  there should be no reason. They're banning christian rips all over the
[02:43:09.160 --> 02:43:12.920]  country. As far as I can tell, there's no good reason
[02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:18.360]  to cancel the event. There's no violent crowds out here.
[02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:21.400]  Everyone seems to be peacefully minding their own business. These are all death
[02:43:21.400 --> 02:43:23.640]  metal people trying to get involved with me.
[02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:26.760]  They're doing our drugs. They're doing our sex.
[02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:31.720]  Jesus is a man. He was a man who figured out the
[02:43:31.720 --> 02:43:34.600]  eyes. Read your book, because it's all in your book.
[02:43:34.600 --> 02:43:40.240]  Repent! Repent! Repent!
[02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:44.840]  They're anti-pro-satan. Look at these satanists.
[02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:48.440]  You're watching the video. It's just like total merge.
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:58.920]  And pro-anti-pro-god, so pro-god. Men reyelling at each other.
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:02.920]  So I'm saying maybe like not men yelling would be like
[02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:06.000]  a third thing as opposed to God or Satan.
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:07.640]  All right, thank you, ma'am.
[02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:08.640]  Yeah, totally.
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:12.720]  Still, I just find it kind of funny how the Christians won't allow anyone to have a satanic
[02:44:12.720 --> 02:44:17.480]  black mass, but they can have their own mass and no one protests because it's okay, like
[02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:19.280]  they're saying they're right.
[02:44:19.280 --> 02:44:22.200]  And the way they think is the only way to think.
[02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:25.360]  And if you think on the opposite side and Satanism, you're wrong, it's stupid.
[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:30.360]  Well, the reason I'm here is to make sure that the actual message of the so-called
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:32.320]  adversary, Satan.
[02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:33.320]  Satan means enemy.
[02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:38.520]  I don't know if everyone knows that, but the so-called adversary is not actually what
[02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:39.520]  Satan's about.
[02:44:39.520 --> 02:44:42.520]  Satan's about love, kindness, acceptance, liberty, truth.
[02:44:42.520 --> 02:44:47.400]  Those are just five of the bullet points, the five points of the pentagram, see.
[02:44:47.400 --> 02:44:54.680]  My God is best, the Egyptian God of war, and I just yesterday invited Jesus into my heart,
[02:44:54.680 --> 02:45:01.640]  which is a female Jesus more scantily-clad than a regular Jesus.
[02:45:01.640 --> 02:45:03.560]  Lucian Grieves is not even his name.
[02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:05.120]  His real name is Doug Mezner.
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:08.400]  He is a fake to the extreme.
[02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:11.000]  Anybody that reads his page knows this.
[02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:12.000]  He's admitted he's not-
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.600]  So now we have Satanist saying other people aren't really Satanists.
[02:45:14.600 --> 02:45:18.520] ...spiritual on any level, and yet he claims he's doing positive things for the satanic
[02:45:18.520 --> 02:45:19.520]  community.
[02:45:19.520 --> 02:45:24.640]  Satan, with the goat head, a pentagram in the background surrounded by adoring children,
[02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:29.280]  it is hilarious and scary, and also part of an elaborate trolling enterprise by an organization
[02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:34.040]  called the Satanic Temple, which has emerged as a weird, bizarro world religious freedom
[02:45:34.040 --> 02:45:35.040]  gadfly.
[02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:39.200]  Everything is doing is a publicity stunt for a movie he's making called the Satanic Temple.
[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:42.160]  So what he's trying to do is piss people off, so to speak?
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:46.600]  Let me tell you, Satanists aren't going to get many followers of women out of ugly.
[02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:47.600]  We all despise them.
[02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:49.720]  Okay, are you a Satanist?
[02:45:49.720 --> 02:45:51.040]  Yes, I am.
[02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:54.280]  And so basically what you're saying, he's not a real Satanist.
[02:45:54.280 --> 02:45:56.000]  He's not a Satanist on any level.
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:57.000]  He's admitted to-
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:02.040]  The statue in Oklahoma and the black mask, if you will, were completely separate, and
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:06.320]  I was a little disappointed at all the press we got for the black mask because I feel it
[02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:11.760]  overshadows the more important issue of the monument.
[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:15.600]  And he's working, the statue they want to put up in Oklahoma, and here's a real kick
[02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:16.800]  in the head.
[02:46:16.800 --> 02:46:21.560]  The person whose name is on the papers that it's actually enabling him to do this is the
[02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:23.720]  wife of a convicted sex offender.
[02:46:23.720 --> 02:46:27.040]  The Satanic Church is in the back of Adam and Kelsey Daniels' home.
[02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:28.040]  Look at these people.
[02:46:28.040 --> 02:46:32.400]  Kelsey is the one who submitted the application to have the Satanic monument erected at the
[02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:35.720]  state capitol next to the one of the Ten Commandments.
[02:46:35.720 --> 02:46:43.040]  Adam Daniels in 2009 was convicted of a sexual battery on a person over the age of 16.
[02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:46.360]  You know what, Satan is here, and he ain't going anywhere.
[02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:47.800]  We have your children.
[02:46:47.800 --> 02:46:52.680]  We have everyone that we need to defeat you because in the last war, there was one third
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:54.120]  and we almost won.
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:58.440]  Michael Anu, I don't care what you go by now, we will defeat you.
[02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:03.880]  Now, does the scare you or infuriate you that this stuff is now going on in the public?
[02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:10.200]  It actually infuriates me, but it also strengthens my faith and makes me want to become a militant
[02:47:10.200 --> 02:47:14.920]  for my church and come out and stand up for the truth in what's good and right.
[02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:17.560]  I think it shocks and disappoints me more than anything else.
[02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:22.360]  Now, Homeland Security, now our own government is now classifying the average Christian now
[02:47:22.360 --> 02:47:23.360]  as a domestic terrorist.
[02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:26.440]  Now, how does that make you feel that our government is now talking to us?
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:32.440]  I do know that I've seen a lot of Democrat political figures talking about Christians
[02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:33.440]  as terrorists.
[02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:38.600]  Well, I guess it makes me know that the people in my government are no longer representing
[02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:44.280]  me and that I have to continue to know my faith and believe in my faith and trust in
[02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:47.440]  God that in the end, he will prevail.
[02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:55.200]  I expect that saying what the Bible teaches eventually is going to be illegal and so be
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:47:56.200]  it.
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:47:57.280]  Well, we have to keep saying it.
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:00.040]  We live in dangerous times.
[02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:01.040]  I think it's horrible.
[02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:03.880]  I mean, what else is there to say?
[02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:08.000]  All sorts of organizations, disreputable organizations that have their own agendas like the Southern
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:14.080]  Pavi Law Center and groups like that demonize Christians who want to publicly profess their
[02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:19.880]  faith like we are and who oppose all sorts of abominations against marriage, abortion.
[02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:21.760]  And that's all considered to them hate speech.
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:23.320]  Yeah, it's considered hate speech.
[02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:27.760]  But of course, they engage in their own hate speech by vilifying us and there's a nice
[02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:29.640]  double standard that they have for themselves.
[02:48:29.640 --> 02:48:34.520]  The protesters that say otherwise, unfortunately, they're just believing what they're told.
[02:48:34.520 --> 02:48:38.640]  I mean, not everyone has a genius IQ like me and Kanye West.
[02:48:38.640 --> 02:48:41.960]  So it's really hard for everyone else to figure it out.
[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:42.960]  But I figured it out.
[02:48:42.960 --> 02:48:45.520]  I could tell you we're physically pushed out of there.
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:47.520]  But he didn't touch nobody.
[02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:49.520]  These are violent gatherings.
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:51.960]  We got thrown out of a public space.
[02:48:51.960 --> 02:48:56.000]  We were pushed up, turned pushed, pushed up, pushed up, pushed up, pushed up, pushed up.
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:57.000]  Genius IQ.
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:58.000]  You didn't know where to do it.
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.120]  I bet Joe wanted to go to Pinship.
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:05.640]  So right here at the church behind us, the gentlemen who were leading this event tonight
[02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:07.680]  actually came in to the pulpit.
[02:49:07.680 --> 02:49:10.720]  I was kind of walking away and headed back to the parking garage.
[02:49:10.720 --> 02:49:14.920]  They came into this church right here, went behind the pulpit, pushed people out from
[02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:19.160]  behind the pulpit and started screaming aggressively Hail Satan, et cetera.
[02:49:19.160 --> 02:49:22.360]  Just basically trying to worship Satan in this house of God right here.
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:23.360]  That's why they got thrown out.
[02:49:23.360 --> 02:49:25.400]  So I did go in and just kind of told them they needed to leave.
[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:29.280]  And at that point, several gentlemen from the church behind us did escort them out.
[02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:30.280]  They did not go willingly.
[02:49:30.280 --> 02:49:34.520]  They were actually violent in the process and they were screaming and trespassing until
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:39.000]  the police actually came about five minutes later and then they changed their whole story.
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:40.000]  So that's what happened.
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:43.920]  And as you can see, it's a great spiritual divide as we had got comments from people
[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:45.560]  from both sides of the fence.
[02:49:45.560 --> 02:49:47.640]  But yeah, this is the question.
[02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:51.840]  Could this be another attempt by the mainstream media and the government to not only divide
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:57.000]  the American citizen politically and racially, but also spiritually as well?
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:58.600]  That's the question you might want to ask.
[02:49:58.600 --> 02:50:02.760]  And this is Dan Baddandi for the Info Wars Nightly News.
[02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:10.600]  I fear losing Christ more than I do of this in itself because Christ is greater than this.
[02:50:10.600 --> 02:50:13.320]  Well the Christians were very well spoken overall.
[02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:17.800]  There was a few kooky ones, but that's to be expected and people get passionate.
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:22.960]  But the Satanists, when you watch the video, another video posted right now at infowars.com,
[02:50:22.960 --> 02:50:28.800]  we'll tweet it out at Real Alex Jones, are just hateful people and they want our children.
[02:50:28.800 --> 02:50:32.520]  In fact, they say our children belong to them.
[02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:36.000]  And all I can say is that if one of those people, if I was in that church, put their
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:41.240]  hands on me, I'll show them how powerful Satan is.
[02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:45.320]  The Satan is not going to be able to do jack squat for them when I knock their teeth out.
[02:50:45.320 --> 02:50:47.320]  Those people are weak and that's why they worship Satan.
[02:50:47.320 --> 02:50:48.320]  They're looking for power.
[02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:52.200]  If they had real power, they'd hit their knees before the Creator of the universe and stop
[02:50:52.200 --> 02:50:54.760]  being such worm like scum.
[02:50:54.760 --> 02:50:57.760]  But they love their father and they love weakness because they're failures.
[02:50:57.760 --> 02:50:58.760]  We'll be back.
[02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:25.320]  Stay with me.
[02:51:25.320 --> 02:51:51.320]  We'll see you in the next video.
[02:51:51.320 --> 02:52:20.440]  And we'll see you in the next video.
[02:52:20.440 --> 02:52:39.360]  We'll see you in the next video.
[02:52:39.360 --> 02:52:57.560]  We'll see you in the next video.
[02:52:57.560 --> 02:53:27.480]  We'll see you in the next video.
[02:53:27.480 --> 02:53:57.400]  And we'll see you in the next video.
[02:53:57.400 --> 02:54:26.320]  We'll see you in the next video.
[02:54:26.320 --> 02:54:56.120]  We'll see you in the next video.
[02:54:56.120 --> 02:55:00.480]  Church says 50% of people are conspiracy theorists.
[02:55:00.480 --> 02:55:03.080]  You're probably one of them.
[02:55:03.080 --> 02:55:10.280]  That's up on infowars.com by Elizabeth Rentner and it's a JAMA, the Journal of American Medical
[02:55:10.280 --> 02:55:13.280]  Association.
[02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:20.480]  And they said that you can be a simple minded, that's a eugenics term, medical conspiracy
[02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:26.880]  cook is what they write about, if you believe the following, imagine this, this is what
[02:55:26.880 --> 02:55:34.440]  doctors reading the American Medical Association's journal, JAMA, that if your patient says this,
[02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:42.520]  this is a bad person and the doctor can laugh at you and feel like an authority because
[02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:46.280]  you believe cell phones are causing cancer and the government is refusing to act.
[02:55:46.280 --> 02:55:51.360]  Yes, you believe the sun came up this morning as well and other kooky things, GMO labeling
[02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:56.800]  used for population control or GM, I had a Freudian slip, I wish we had GMO labeling,
[02:55:56.800 --> 02:55:59.880]  it's GMOs being used for population control.
[02:55:59.880 --> 02:56:03.360]  Well, that's what they're piggybacking into many of the GMOs.
[02:56:03.360 --> 02:56:09.240]  The government's suppressing alternative medicine, that's on record they are and that vaccinations
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:15.200]  are causing autism and they're clearly linked to it and HIV was intentionally being sent
[02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:17.320]  into African American communities.
[02:56:17.320 --> 02:56:25.000]  Well, it's definitely race specific and affects non-Northern Europeans more.
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:33.440]  The virus from medical doctors we've had on, the team of the sites of Northern Europeans
[02:56:33.440 --> 02:56:38.440]  don't have the same receptor sites as what I, and again, I'm not a doctor, I was going
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:40.440]  off what's been broken down.
[02:56:40.440 --> 02:56:44.160]  It's very hard, this is in mainline medical literature, you can look it up.
[02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:53.760]  For what is known as Aryans to get HIV, it does happen mainly from massive anal sex or
[02:56:53.760 --> 02:56:58.600]  run down immune systems and intravenous drug use, where you've been using bad drugs that
[02:56:58.600 --> 02:57:03.120]  have heavy metals and Grignard reagents and other things in it that already kill your
[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:07.080]  T lymphocytes and then the virus is able to move in, you get the cancers and the rest
[02:57:07.080 --> 02:57:08.080]  of it.
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:13.720]  And I've had so many scientists on about this, but nearly half of 49% of participants
[02:57:13.720 --> 02:57:18.920]  in the study conducted by JAMA said they believe with at least one of the theories.
[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:25.160]  So JAMA is shaking their hands in fear, my gosh, my gosh, they think cell phones are
[02:57:25.160 --> 02:57:26.160]  hurting them.
[02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:29.440]  I mean, it's been on record since the things came out.
[02:57:29.440 --> 02:57:37.040]  Meanwhile, it's come out now that they're going to remove most of the soap off the store
[02:57:37.040 --> 02:57:41.800]  shelves because 75% of it is called antibacterial and has a chemical known to manipulate your
[02:57:41.800 --> 02:57:45.160]  hormones and reduce fertility and do a bunch of other horrible things.
[02:57:45.160 --> 02:57:54.720]  It's done by design through things that are ubiquitously used, printer ink, water, plastic
[02:57:54.720 --> 02:57:56.220]  linings.
[02:57:56.220 --> 02:58:01.720]  They get us coming and going and it's in the White House Science Zars book written the
[02:58:01.720 --> 02:58:07.840]  year I was born 40 years ago, 1974, Eco Science.
[02:58:07.840 --> 02:58:13.840]  I mean, these people think you're so dumb, this stuff's all hiding in plain view.
[02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:16.760]  Pricklesand is the name of the chemical.
[02:58:16.760 --> 02:58:18.000]  And don't believe them.
[02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:19.640]  I mean, mothers never nurse their babies.
[02:58:19.640 --> 02:58:22.240]  They gave their babies pricklesand at birth.
[02:58:22.240 --> 02:58:25.440]  Satan is here and he ain't going anywhere.
[02:58:25.440 --> 02:58:27.400]  We have your children.
[02:58:27.400 --> 02:58:31.160]  We have everyone that we need.
[02:58:31.160 --> 02:58:34.040]  And that is that punk Satanist slowed down.
[02:58:34.040 --> 02:58:35.040]  Isn't he scary?
[02:58:35.040 --> 02:58:36.040]  Aren't you scared of him?
[02:58:36.040 --> 02:58:38.040]  Don't you want to stop his head in the ground?
[02:58:38.040 --> 02:58:39.040]  Over right back, folks.
[02:58:39.040 --> 02:58:40.040]  I'm a little bit overdrive here.
[02:58:40.040 --> 02:58:41.040]  I don't want to do that.
[02:58:41.040 --> 02:58:42.040]  I want to love you.
[02:58:42.040 --> 02:58:43.040]  Yeah.
[02:58:43.040 --> 02:58:46.040]  And you'll find just a nerd who's scared.
[02:58:46.040 --> 02:58:47.040]  Calm today.
[02:58:47.040 --> 02:59:14.040]  He really wants to know Satan.
[02:59:14.040 --> 02:59:17.880]  Now, the ammunition is information and the soldiers are you.
[02:59:17.880 --> 02:59:22.160]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[02:59:22.160 --> 02:59:26.040]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand
[02:59:26.040 --> 02:59:27.040]  years.
[02:59:27.040 --> 02:59:28.040]  And I'm still fighting.
[02:59:28.040 --> 02:59:31.200]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're going to lose everything.
[02:59:31.200 --> 02:59:33.080]  The Info War is worldwide.
[02:59:33.080 --> 02:59:37.360]  Tell your friends about Info Wars and let them know that Info Wars doesn't print bull.
[02:59:37.360 --> 02:59:41.200]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented fact.
[02:59:41.200 --> 02:59:48.280]  Step up and take your friends and family to infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv and planetinfowars.com.
[02:59:48.280 --> 02:59:51.400]  The truth will set them free.
[02:59:51.400 --> 02:59:55.080]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.080 --> 03:00:05.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.320 --> 03:00:10.120]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.120 --> 03:00:11.120]  You want answers?
[03:00:11.120 --> 03:00:13.280]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.280 --> 03:00:17.480]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[03:00:17.480 --> 03:00:22.240]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.240 --> 03:00:30.520]  They made a male clone of a cross between Janet Renum, Janet Napolitano, Rachel Maddow.
[03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:33.960]  Then Maddow plays the part of a guy, too, who's another host on there she plays the
[03:00:33.960 --> 03:00:34.960]  part of.
[03:00:34.960 --> 03:00:35.960]  She's an accomplished actress.
[03:00:35.960 --> 03:00:40.360]  Who's the guy on there that she looks like?
[03:00:40.360 --> 03:00:45.140]  If you crossed all of them to Chris Hayes, if you crossed all of them together, you would
[03:00:45.140 --> 03:00:46.640]  get this.
[03:00:46.640 --> 03:00:48.480]  And his name is Dung Beatle the Satanist.
[03:00:48.480 --> 03:00:53.160]  This is outside the black mask in Harvard as he announces how powerful he is.
[03:00:53.160 --> 03:00:56.920]  He probably lives on the street because Satan's giving him so much power.
[03:00:56.920 --> 03:00:58.400]  And I'm sorry to talk like a tough guy.
[03:00:58.400 --> 03:00:59.680]  I don't usually do that.
[03:00:59.680 --> 03:01:09.840]  I just literally want to, I just really want to stomp on these people when I see them dancing
[03:01:09.840 --> 03:01:10.840]  around and acting tough.
[03:01:10.840 --> 03:01:14.920]  I just, there's, like, I don't see anybody and I want to attack them.
[03:01:14.920 --> 03:01:19.760]  But these gutters Satanists, I literally say they've got our kids and I'm not saying attack
[03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:20.760]  them.
[03:01:20.760 --> 03:01:21.760]  I wouldn't attack them.
[03:01:21.760 --> 03:01:25.720]  I'm saying I'm having a visceral response of revulsion.
[03:01:25.720 --> 03:01:28.520]  And I think it's to the weakness.
[03:01:28.520 --> 03:01:34.280]  The weak soul sucked pathetic wraith of saying our kids belong to him.
[03:01:34.280 --> 03:01:37.680]  But I guess in a way, the higher level Satanist, Luciferians do run the planet.
[03:01:37.680 --> 03:01:40.960]  And can we keep the MSNBC where she says the kids belong to us?
[03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:42.900]  Because that's always the refrain.
[03:01:42.900 --> 03:01:45.920]  Your children belong to us.
[03:01:45.920 --> 03:01:46.920]  Whatever that lady's name is.
[03:01:46.920 --> 03:01:48.720]  She has the same gleam in her eye.
[03:01:48.720 --> 03:01:50.920]  Melissa Harris Perry.
[03:01:50.920 --> 03:01:55.200]  So let's go ahead and go to this creature of this, this thing.
[03:01:55.200 --> 03:01:56.200]  There it sits.
[03:01:56.200 --> 03:01:57.200]  Here it is.
[03:01:57.200 --> 03:01:58.680]  And he ain't going anywhere.
[03:01:58.680 --> 03:02:00.120]  We have your children.
[03:02:00.120 --> 03:02:04.760]  We have everyone that we need.
[03:02:04.760 --> 03:02:06.880]  Let's play the longer clip of that guy.
[03:02:06.880 --> 03:02:07.880]  What's his name?
[03:02:07.880 --> 03:02:12.760]  You guys didn't get his name anywhere there?
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:16.120]  I mean, look, it's just, it's just unbelievable.
[03:02:16.120 --> 03:02:20.280]  I mean, wanting to be bad.
[03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:28.120]  And then saying Satan gives you love and Satan gives you liberty.
[03:02:28.120 --> 03:02:30.160]  Satan is here and he ain't going anywhere.
[03:02:30.160 --> 03:02:31.600]  We have your children.
[03:02:31.600 --> 03:02:36.480]  We have everyone that we need to defeat you because in the last war, there was one third
[03:02:36.480 --> 03:02:37.840]  and we almost won.
[03:02:37.840 --> 03:02:40.680]  Michael, I knew I don't care what you go by now.
[03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:42.600]  We will defeat you.
[03:02:42.600 --> 03:02:47.840]  Now does this scare you on the area you that this is now it makes me like when I see a
[03:02:47.840 --> 03:02:48.840]  big cockroach.
[03:02:48.840 --> 03:02:53.600]  I go turn my lights on at night and there's a big, big palmetto bug on the sink, eating
[03:02:53.600 --> 03:02:54.840]  a piece of bread or something.
[03:02:54.840 --> 03:02:56.240]  That's how I feel about you.
[03:02:56.240 --> 03:02:57.240]  I don't feel scared.
[03:02:57.240 --> 03:03:04.760]  I have this instinct like I do with a roach, a real serious desire that you not escape.
[03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:07.760]  I'm sorry.
[03:03:07.760 --> 03:03:11.720]  I mean, people saying, because just, just, you know, earlier in the clip, he's talking
[03:03:11.720 --> 03:03:17.480]  about how Satan loves you to give you freedom, but you have our kids, our kids, you want
[03:03:17.480 --> 03:03:22.880]  our kids because you're so into liberty, right?
[03:03:22.880 --> 03:03:29.720]  Let's go ahead and go to the technocrat, the anti-family socialist on MSNBC and their
[03:03:29.720 --> 03:03:31.880]  promo echoing the Satanist.
[03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:35.400]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong
[03:03:35.400 --> 03:03:40.200]  to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[03:03:40.200 --> 03:03:44.200]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making
[03:03:44.200 --> 03:03:45.200]  better investments.
[03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:49.160]  And they have the famous communist slogan, lean forward, imagine her and that Satanist
[03:03:49.160 --> 03:03:50.160]  at dinner.
[03:03:50.160 --> 03:03:52.720]  They're both seeking after temporal power.
[03:03:52.720 --> 03:03:55.840]  They both are convinced of how great they are and they should run everything.
[03:03:55.840 --> 03:04:01.560]  I got an idea for you and the Satanist, Perry, keep your hands off our children, stay out
[03:04:01.560 --> 03:04:02.560]  of our life.
[03:04:02.560 --> 03:04:03.560]  You're a wreck.
[03:04:03.560 --> 03:04:05.040]  You're a powerless joke.
[03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:10.040]  That's why you seek to use our goodwill to go along with your orders as if you're the
[03:04:10.040 --> 03:04:11.280]  moral high ground.
[03:04:11.280 --> 03:04:16.160]  You are the same as that dirt bag devil worshipper.
[03:04:16.160 --> 03:04:18.760]  You are weak from the foundations of the earth.
[03:04:18.760 --> 03:04:21.520]  You are scum.
[03:04:21.520 --> 03:04:26.320]  All of you that seek to hurt innocents that seek to mutate the planet and the genetic code
[03:04:26.320 --> 03:04:33.320]  that God created, you are an abomination desolation and you will beg if the new order comes into
[03:04:33.320 --> 03:04:39.800]  full fruition in your lifetime, you will beg God for forgiveness in the final equation
[03:04:39.800 --> 03:04:44.800]  because you're so cowardly and so pathetic and so chicken-necked and so unbelievably
[03:04:44.800 --> 03:04:46.200]  weak.
[03:04:46.200 --> 03:04:51.200]  You are weak and it is so sad to see someone so pathetic.
[03:04:51.200 --> 03:04:54.920]  I didn't know they piled crap that high, Perry.
[03:04:54.920 --> 03:05:10.720]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
